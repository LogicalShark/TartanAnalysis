Snags squelch progress of Tech Center
Pittsburgh Technology Center delayed by cyanide-laced soil
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Senior Staffwriter
Two more setbacks have befallen Carne­
gie Mellon’s involvement with the Pitts­
burgh Technology Center. Anewbout with 
cost overruns has caused another reap­
praisal of intended facilities, while at the 
same time, concerns over cyanide con­
tamination at the site have postponed the 
design process.
The Pittsburgh Technology Center is a 
planned complex of buildings to serve as a 
center for research in high-technology
fields. Built on the sight of the former 
Jones and Laughlin Steel Corporation mill, 
the project is a cooperative arrangement 
between the state, the city, Carnegie 
Mellon, the University of Pittsburgh, and 
private developers.
The project was first conceived in 1983, 
when the Urban Redevelopment Author­
ity (URA) acquired the 50 acres of land 
which was formerly home to the J&L mill, 
located between Monongahela River and 
Second Avenue.
Through an agreement between the URA 
and the Regional Industrial Development
Corporation (RIDC), Carnegie Mellon was 
given approximately 10.8 acres. The Uni­
versity was permitted to develop up to 
300,000 square feet of that land, plus 
parking. The University of Pittsburgh was 
given approximately 9.2 acres, on which it 
was permitted to develop up to 250,000 
square feet, plus parking.
The Commonwealth of Pennsylvania 
granted Carnegie Mellon $17 million, 
which the University originally planned to 
use toward construction of a radical six- 
section building to house Mellon Institute 
and its research-related activities. De­
signed by Architect Peter Eisenman, the 
facility was to be comprised of interlocking 
“Boolean cubes,” at a projected cost of $20 
million.
While construction drawings were 
underway last year, however, Carnegie 
Mellon began a fundamental reconsidera­
tion of the building’s design after it be­
came evident that the costs of such a 
facility were far in excess of initial projec­
tions. The decision was then made to re­
duce costs by simplifying the basic struc­
ture of the building, and eliminating sev-

for new 
VP post
By NICOLE BROCKMANN
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Carnegie Mellon President 
Richard Cyert announced yes­
terday that Vice President for 
University Planning Patrick 
Keating will move into a new 
position thatwill encompass his 
current responsibilities as well 
as those of outgoing Vice Presi­
dent for Business Affairs Fred 
Rogers.
Keating will become the 
University’s vice president for 
planning and business aifairs 
after Rogers leaves on June 30. 
Rogers is leaving Carnegie 
Mellon to assume the post of 
treasurer and vice presidentfor 
finance at Cornell University.
Keating’s current duties as 
vice president for University 
planning include strategic plan­
ning and space allocation, espe­
cially that of the incipient Uni­
versity Center. To these respon­
sibilities will be added the finan­
cial duties of the vice president 
for business affairs position.
According to Cyert, “there will 
probably be some changes” in the
structures of the two depart­
ments in order to make the 
combinedresponsibilitiesman- 
ageable for one person.

Smoking kindles 
fear, resentment in 
Financial Aid Office
By FARRON W. LEVY
Tartan Assistant News Editor
You are a non-smoker. You have 
a high stress job and your office is 
closed in and cramped with your 
colleagues who are also making 
the best of the stressful environ­
ment.
The room that you spend your 
entire day in is filled with ciga­
rette and cigar smoke, yet you are 
scared to say anything about it 
because you value your job.
Welcome to Carnegie Mellon’s 
Financial Aid Office. People are 
upset, yet scared to talk.
“If things are going to change, 
it’s going to have to come from 
people outside of the office,” said 
one person involved.
A letter to the editor in last 
week’s Tartan complaining about 
the excessive smoke did just that. 
The letter stated that employees 
of the office “walk around toting 
lit cigars and cigarettes near the 
front desk and waiting areas.” 
The writer entered the office on a

number of occasions and “Each 
time, I emerged coughing and 
reeking of cigarette smoke.” 
Although some feel this to be an 
excessive description, Associate 
Dean of Student Affairs Lois Cox 
also notices the problem despite 
the fact that her office is down the 
hall. “You can smell the smoke in 
the common non-office areas,” she 
said.
Employees bringing their cigars 
or cigarettes into the non-office 
area is a problem. But then there

Army discharges ROTC detachment despite pleas
By RHONDA STRUMINGER
Tartan Staffwriter
Plagued by several years of sub­
standard recruitment, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Army ROTC unit is 
scheduled to begin a phasing-out 
process this May that will culmi­
nate in the closing of the unit in 
the fall of 1991, Army officers 
said last week.
According to Captain James Del
Re, executive officer of CMU’s 
Army ROTC unit, “This is basi­
cally a management action. There 
are Congressionally mandated 
viability standards for the ROTC 
programs of all three services. 
These [standards] require that 
you must bring in a certain num­
ber of freshmen and then at the 
other end, there are so many 
seniors that you must commis­
sion as lieutenants. For our status

here as a small University the 
standard is 15; we haven’t met 
that standard since the end of the
draft.”
However, the University is not 
standing idly by as the unit is
being closed. “We don’t think the 
Army should be following a step 
which will rule them out of get­
ting students like Carnegie Mel­
lon has to offer,” said Carnegie 
Mellon President Richard M. 
Cyert. “They should be paying 
more attention to quality than 
quantity: they get quality stu­
dents here though they may not 
get the same quantity.”

MIT nominee 
declines; CMU 
search on track
By MICHAEL J. EWEDOSH
Tartan News Editor
Despite MIT’s unexpected return to the 
presidential search arena, officials involved 
in Carnegie Mellon’s presidential search seem 
convinced that the MIT search won’t have 
any major impact on Carnegie Mellon’s.
“I don’t think it’s going to affect us,” said 
Carnegie Mellon President Richard M. Cyert. 
“I don’t think we’re looking at any of the same 
people.”
Only six days after MIT’s presidential 
search group announced that it would recom­
mend Philip Sharp for MIT’s presidency, 
Sharp withdrew from consideration for the 
post.
In a statement released lastTuesday, Henry 
Jacoby, chair of MIT’s faculty, said that the 
45-year-old biology professor and director of 
MIT’s Center for Cancer Research was hon­
ored by the confidence the search committees 
had in his abilities, but realized he could not 
give up scientific research and teaching.
Sharp’s about-face sent shock waves

WORLD NEWS
Unified Germany 
would trim 
armed forces
EAST BERLIN (AP) — East 
Germany proposed slashing the 
armed forces of a united Germany 
by two-thirds of presentcombined 
forces, and called for some U.S. 
and Soviet troops to remain dur­
ing the unification process.
In Bonn, a West German gov­
ernment spokesman said the 
government of a united Germany 
could give Poland a guarantee of 
its borders.
A ZDF television report quoted 
government spokesman Dieter 
Vogel as saying the formula for 
achieving Germ an unification had 
been set by the victorious World 
War II Allies.
But he said this process would 
include consultations with Po­
land, according to the report.
East German Defense Minister 
Theodor Hoffmann, outlining a
plan for merging the two Ger- 
manys’ armed forces, said both 
states should remain in their 
respective military alliances un­
til unification is achieved under a 
new European security system.
Admiral Hoffmann said the 
armed forces of a future joint 
German army should be first 
reduced to about 300,000 men, 
and later cut to between 150,000 
and 200,000 soldiers. The armed 
forces’ character should be purely 
defensive, Hoffmann said.
Conservatives 
maintain hold on 
Japanese house
TOKYO (DJ)—Japan’s conser­
vative governing party fought off 
criticism about scandals and an 
unpopular tax, and held onto its 
majority in parliament’s power­
ful lower house, official returns 
showed.
Voters re-elected nearly all of 
the Liberal Democrats implicated
in a stock scandal in which many 
politicians profited from cut-rate 
shares.
However, the party’s seats de­
clined from the 295 it held in the 
outgoing house, while the largest 
opposition group, the Japan So­
cialist Party, made dramatic 
gains, rising from 83 seats in the 
last house to at least 136.
Socialist Party Chair Takako 
Doi vowed to carry on with her 
party’s effort to repeal an unpopu­
lar sales tax: “Our purpose was to 
reduce the Liberal Democrats’ 
strength as much as possible. But 
we’ll carry out what we promised 
during the campaigns, in coop­
eration with other opposition 
parties.”
She added that her party would 
consult with the Socialists begin­
ning tomorrow over the nation’s 
future.
Japan’s constitution grants the 
lower house the power to appoint 
the prime minister and to pass 
the budget over the objections of 
the upper house.
Mandela plans 
strategy sessions
JOHANNESBURG (AP)-nNel- 
son Mandela, the African National 
Congress leader, conferred- last 
Friday with parliamentary oppo­
sition leaders, and aides released 
details of his first trip abroad since 
leaving prison—an 18-day,.§)ur- 
nation trip starting next week.
Aides also confirmed that 
Mandela, who has endorsed the 
nationalization of South Africa’s 
mines, planned to meet with'the 
chairman of the country’s largest 
mining conglomerate.
Gavin Relly, whose Anglo 
American Corporation is the 
world’s primary gold producer, 
had accepted an invitation to visit 
Mandela’s house in the b'Vack 
township of Soweto.
Mandela plans to fly today to 
Lusaka, Zambia. There, he will 
meet’ leaders of several African 
countries and confer with the 
ANC’s exiled leadership.

A story about changes in student loans in last week’s issue 
[“Fraud prompts changes”] incorrectly described the impetus for 
changes in emergency student loans. The changes were planned 
before the fraud was discovered, according to Acting Dean of Stu­
dent Affairs Michael C. Murphy.
In last week’s story about cardboard chairs built by a design 
class [“Cardboai-d chairs?’’], freshman Hendrick Kiamzon’s chair 
was attributed as the chair that held the most weight. His chair, 
in fact, was the one to receive the highest grade.
In last week’s “A person’s opinion,“ freshman James Shultz 
was incorrectly identified.
A photo caption in the last issue incorrectly stated the number 
of new pledges received by Delta Tau Delta. The Delts received 
two new pledges this spring.
A story in last week’s issue [“Romance and intrigue make for

at the time.
Bush opposes 
tax cuts for 
student loans
WASHINGTON (DJ) — The 
Bush admininstration told Con­
gress it opposes a proposal to re- 
insitute a tax deduction for inter­
est paid on student loans.
“The administration opposes 
this proposal because it favors 
one group of borrowers at the 
expense of others,” Assistant 
Treasury Secretary for Tax Pol­
icy Kenneth Gideon said in testi­
mony presented to the House 
Ways and Means Committee.
The 1986 Tax Reform Act 
phased out the deduction for 
consumer interest expenses, in­
cluding interest paid on student 
loans, over a four-year period. For 
1990, only ten percent of con­
sumer interest is deductible. For 
taxable years after 1990, no de­
duction will be allowed for such 
interest expense.
Under the proposal opposed by 
Gideon, reinstitutingthe student 
loan deduction would have been 
paid for by accelerating the phase­
out of the consumer interest de­
duction, making only five percent 
of consumer interest deductible 
for 1990.
Gideon said the proposed 
method of payment for reviving 
the student loan deduction is 
“independently objectionable, 
even if it were accomplished in a 
manner that did not treat some 
groups of borrowers differently.”
Reagan testifies 
in Iran-Contra trial
WASHINGTON (D J) — In tes­
timony taped for the Iran-Contra 
trial of former national security 
adviser John Poindexter, former 
President Reagan said he “as­
sured everybody that we would 
have to abide by the law” during 
the ban on Contra aid.
Asked if he had any idea that 
Oliver North was giving the 
Contras military advice and lo­
gistical support, Reagan said, “I 
guess that I had never... had any 
inkling that we were guiding their 
strategy in any way.”
That statement came under 
cross-examination by Iran-Con- 
tra prosecutor Dan Webb during 
the questioning of Reagan in Los 
Angeles.
“May I simply point out that I 
had no knowledge then or now 
that there had been a diversion, 
and I never used the term,” Re­
agan said. “And all I knew was 
that there was some money that 
came from some place in another 
account, and that the appearance 
was that it might have been part 
of the negotiated sale.”
“To the extent that there was in 
fact a diversion of proceeds, did 
you in any way approve or au­
thorize that while you were presi­
dent of the United States?” Webb 
asked.
“For heaven’s sake, no,” Reagan 
replied. “And when I was once 
asked about that extra money and 
said if it was an added sum to the 
purchase price, what would I do, 
I said I would have given it back.” 
Reagan added, “No one has 
proven to me that there was a 
diversion.”
Court confirms 
Congressional 
hold on 55 mph
WASHINGTON (DJ) — The 
Supreme Court let stand a fed­
eral appeals court ruling uphold-
ing the power of Congress to^cut 
off federal highway aid to stàtes 
that fail to enforce a 55 miles-per- 
hour speed limit.
The justices refused to hear a 
challenge by the state of Nevada 
to the constitutionality of the law 
authorizing cutting off highway 
funds.
Nevada sued after the regional 
federal highway office threatened 
to cut off all federal highway >aid ; 
to the state unless state officials 
scrapped the legislature’s plan to 
raise the speed limit to 70 miles- 
per-hour.
The lawsuit argued that it is 
unconstitutional for Congresfe to 
use excessive financial coercion 
to force states to comply, with 
national laws.

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 27 February 19903
RAF expert entices students with discussion of Europe
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Contributing Editor
“We’re dealing with events that 
"¦"weren’t even thought possible as 
recently as six months ago. And 
remember that politics is the art 
of the possible.”
That’s an analysis from Sir 
Michael Knight, former Air Mar­
shal in the Royal Air Force and 
tfritil recently United Kingdom 
Military Representative to NATO, 
'-oh the dizzying pace of change 
^sweeping Europe.
In the first of what students 
hope is a series of guest-lecturer 
visits, H&SS and EPP co-hosted 
Knight for a one-week, one-unit 
seminar course for undergradu­
ates last week.
“Prospects for European Peace 
and Security,” 66—200, was billed 
as “examining issues and strate­
gies that have affected and shaped 
the goals of peace and security in 
Europe, particularly in light of 
recent events in Eastern Europe 
and the Soviet Union.”
Knight solicited suggestions in
a final course evaluation, remind­
ing the class that his visit was “an 
experiment,” and that various 
colleges and departments of the 
University would host future 
guests for similar seminars de­
pending upon the reception of 
66-200. Nearly everyone involved 
agreed that it was a success.
Sophomore Lane Boland said, 
“I really enjoyed having a lec­
turer from a different country 
come teach the class and talk 
about the situation in European 
countries. It’s important to get all
different points of view.” He also 
said that Knight was “very laid- 
back and casual” despite the fact 
that he was the English equiva­
lent of a four star general.
The class was divided into five 
eighty-minute seminar sessions, 
focusing on “A Tale of Two Alli­
ances,” a history of NATO and the 
Warsaw Pact; “Pax Europa?,” an 
analysis of recent events in East­
ern Europe and their bearing on 
the future of the continent; “The 
Problems of Success,” a reflection 
on the possible new roles of NATO
in Europe; and “The Next Step in 
Arms Control” and “A New Secu­
rity Plan for Europe,” which in­
cluded Knight’s ideas for the fu­
ture security of Europe, East and 
West alike.
“They asked me if I wanted to 
teach a course to graduates or 
undergraduates.... I’d rather 
teach undergraduates,” Knight 
smiles. “But don’t forget I’m not 
properly a teacher.”
The class was limited to just 
fifteen students. Sessions were 
held in the Dean’s Conference
Room in Baker Hall; the class 
involved informal discussion be­
tween Knight and the students.
“We must remember that there 
is no ‘Europe,’ ” he warned the 
students. “Each of these coun­
tries has a very different culture 
and history.”
September is the next time 
Knight will return to the United 
States, he says, and when he does, 
he says he looks forward to an­
other visit. Until then, the stu­
dents in 66—200 look forward-to 
other visitors and other seminars.
Pittsburgh may house high-speed ground transportation hub
By DANIEL DE GRANDPRE
r; Tartan Staffwriter
A plan to build a high-speed regional 
ground transportation system in the 
, Pittsburgh area stepped a little closer to 
, reality. Maglev, Inc., the successor to the 
Maglev Working Group established by 
Carnegie Mellon, announced plans Fri­
day to establish Pittsburgh as a manu- 
i t Jacturing center of magnetic levitation- 
, Related equipment and facilities for the 
, • J^nited States.
, t JThe project focuses on the construc­
tion of a 19-mile high speed ground trans- 
portation system that would link down- 
“ "town Pittsburgh to the Greater Pitts­
burgh International Airport. The $350 
million system would allow the trip to be 
made in about nine minutes.
Richard A. Uher, director of Carnegie 
Mellon’s High Speed Ground Transpor- 
tation Center, said that the link would 
“ be operational in 1997. A final feasibility 
' . study for the project will be completed in
• ' the next two and a half years. Design 
nand construction would take about four 
years.
•5 r p Magnetic levitation is a technology that
- enables a train to glide on a magnetic 
:bushion at speeds of up to 310 miles per
' - hour. Maglev trains are wrapped around 
a guideway, eliminating the possibility 
¦ -of derailment. The elevated guideways
- .require no tunneling and use little space, 
causing less disruption to the environ-
' -ment than highways or traditional rail 
systems.
1 The Pittsburgh Maglev project began 
in 1986, when the Pennsylvania Depart- 
inent of Commerce gave a $94,000 grant 
,to Carnegie Mellon to establish a high 
"¦ ¡speed ground transportation database. 
' A year later, the Pennsylvania Depart­
ment of Transportation gave a $97,000 
. grant to CMU. The Pittsburgh Maglev 
Working Group was established in May 
1989, and a preliminary feasibility study 
of the Maglev project was completed in 
December.
The Maglev technology that would be 
used in the Pittsburgh project was not 
developed at Carnegie Mellon, but will 
be licensed from Transrapid Interna­
tional, a West German company. Ac­
cording to the Maglev Working Group’s 
report, the Transrapid technology is the 
only one that is nearly ready for com­
mercial application. The technology also 
costs one-and-a-half to two times less 
than its counterpart, the Japanese su­
perconducting technology.
“Maglev is not a project for which 
Carnegie Mellon takes sole credit,” said 
CMU President Richard M. Cyert. “We 
have operated in a way that I think a 
university should. We have gotten the 
idea started... and now a working group 
is taking it over. I think that this is the 
way a university should participate in 
the economic development of a commu­
nity.”
Maglev, Inc., will be separate from 
Carnegie Mellon, said Cyert, “but the 
university will continue to be a consult­
ant and advisor on this project.”
Governor Robert P. Casey has made 
Carnegie Mellon a grant of $300,000 for 
the final feasibility study. However, 
Cyert said that the Maglev projects would 
not result in an increase in revenue for 
Carnegie Mellon.
A Japanese promotion group has com­
mitted $250,000 to Maglev, Inc. to be 
used in the final feasibility study, and is 
considering participation in the construc­
tion phase of the project.
According to a statement issued by the 
Governor’s office, the Pittsburgh and 
Lake Erie (P&LE) railway is available 
for immediate acquisition for building 
the road from downtown to the airport. 
The P&LE railroad route, which extends 
to Buffalo, Cleveland, Columbus, Erie 
Maryland, and West Virginia, can be 
utilized to build the regional Maglev 
system.
The Maglev link would eventually 
become part of a larger regional mag­
netic levitation system which would serve

communities surrounding Pittsburgh. 
This system would cost about $29 billion 
over a 30-year period.
The study projected that $96 billion in 
regional economic activity would be 
generated by the project.
“What we want to accomplish,” said 
James C. Roddey, chairman ofthe Maglev 
Working Group, “is to secure the license 
for Maglev, Inc. for magnetic levitation 
technology in the United States and to 
create an industrial base and jobs in the
Pittsburgh area to take advantage of the 
development of this technology across 
the country.”
“Maglev represents an opportunity for 
large-scale replacement of manufactur­
ing jobs we’ve lost in western Pennsylva­
nia,” he said. “Service and high tech jobs 
have been emphasized in our economic 
recovery, but we know that every manu­
facturing job creates two more jobs.” 
Maglev officials hope to establish Pitts­
burgh as a hub for a regional Maglev
system that could possibly include Wash­
ington, D.C. and Cleveland, stimulating 
economic development around the tér- 
minals of the regional Maglev system.
The Maglev train levitates when elec­
tromagnets pull it toward the guideway, 
resulting in a 3/8 inch gap between the 
train and the roadway.

Senate hears complaints of bias in speakers board from Zionist group
By RACHEL GARB
Tartan Staffwriter
Accusations of bias spurred de­
bate over the operation of the 
Political Speakers’ Forum Board 
before Student Senate last Tues­
day.
Controversy centered on a pres­
entation featuring a lecture by 
Hebrew University professor 
Moshe Ron, entitled “Israeli 
Opposition to the Occupation,” 
and the Intifada photo exhibit.
“The PSFB is set up in such a 
way that a very small number of 
people have control over a very 
large budget and choose which 
events get endorsed,” said Joshua 
Joffee, representing the Zionist
group Tagar.
“Since the chairman of the Pal­
estine Solidarity Committee holds 
a chair on the PSFB,” he said, 
“this group has a lot of power in 
choosing which events the PSFB 
sponsors. According to last fall’s 
budget and the events scheduled 
for this semster, the only purely 
potitical issue directly involving 
any foreign country dealt with by 
the PSFB has been anti-Israeli 
activity.”
Joumana Matar, who is both a 
PSFB member and chair of the 
Palestine Solidarity Committee, 
defends the Board. “We haven’t 
ever declined anyone’s sugges­
tions for speakers,” she said. 
“Before we brought in Moshe Ron,
we offered Joffee the opportunity 
to bring in a Zionist speaker.” 
“We are open to any sugges­
tions,” said PSFB Chair Jill 
Moore. “During the activities fair 
and at our first lecture, we had 
forms for students to fill out so 
that we could get a better idea of 
what issues would be of interest 
to the campus.”
“We choose issues according to 
how many people will be inter­
ested in attending and the costs 
involved,” said PSFB member 
Seth Kaufman.
“It is obvious that [the exhibit] 
enabled the Palestine Solidarity 
Committee to operate within the 
PSFB,” maintained Joffee’s writ­
ten argument to Senate. Joffee
said that the lecture and exhibit 
were advertised as a PSFB event. 
“But the sign-up sheet that was 
at the information table was for 
the Palestinean Solidarity Com­
mittee,” he said.
Ron’s presentation supported a 
two-state solution to the hostili­
ties between Palestinian and Is­
raeli forces.
Joffee and other members of 
Tagar were outraged at the photo 
exhibit and literature passed out 
during the talk. “The exhibit 
contained a lot of biased and false 
information,” Joffee said, “The 
lack of correspondence between 
photograph and caption in many 
cases makes the propaganda. In 
addition, much of the informa­
tion contained in the literature 
given out at the table was false 
and offensive to Jewish students.”
Joffee mentioned examples of 
photos from the exhibit which he 
called propaganda. “One photo 
was of a rally which was docu­
mented to have taken place in Is­
raeli territory,” he said, “when ac­
tually it takes place in Lebanon.”
“The Forum Board is supposed 
to be political,” replied Kaufman. 
“This means if people don’t like a 
lecture, then we’ve done our job. 
With this event, as with every 
political event, you’re going to 
have people who think it’s propa­
ganda.”
“The PSFB had nothing to do 
with the literature,” added
Kaufman.
The Senate discussion on the 
PSFB “went on and on,” says Chris 
Neighbor, chair of Student Sen­
ate. “Moore and Joffee debated 
for quite a while. I went to the 
talk and I can see where Josh is 
coming from. The captions on the 
pictures were misleading, and I 
can see how someone could take 
offense. However, the problem 
with his presentation was that he 
had no proposal, resolution, or 
solution.”
“In the future,” according to 
Neighbor, “we’ll deal with PSFB 
matters by having the Rules 
Committee review Section 16 of 
the Senate Constitution, which 
deals with the PSFB.”
Army discharges CMU ROTC detachment despite administration pleas
continued from page 1
Del Re said that the departure 
of Army ROTC should not come 
as a surprise to the administra­
tion because it was “in the works” 
for four years. “It started in 1986 
when [the Army] first notified the 
University that we were being 
placed under intensive manage­
ment because the viability stan­
dards were not being met,” he 
said. “They were told that contin­
ual failure to meet these stan­
dards would result in our closure.
“Specific actions were taken by 
the Army to assist the unit to try 
and recruit as well as to solicit the 
assistance of the University four 
years ago. The school never took 
any corrective action until May of 
1989 when they were told we were 
being closed down,” said Del Re.
But Del Re said that corrective 
measures implemented by the 
administration were not enough. 
“They did nothing to facilitate 
students who were not on schol­
arship to enroll in the program,” 
he said.
Until two years ago, Carnegie 
Mellon’s ROTC had been under 
the guidance of then-CIT Dean 
Jim Williams. Associate Vice 
President for Financial Resources 
Walter Cathie proposed that the 
ROTC unit be placed under the 
vice president for enrollment.
“Williams had other priorities; 
Army ROTC was not a priority 
item,” said Cathie. “The programs 
were having trouble, they weren’t 
getting any attention, we weren’t 
getting the numbers, and no one 
really seemed to care. Carnegie

Mellon would look at the num­
bers and nothing changes.”
After switching ROTC to the 
vice president for enrollment, the 
University acted. Once the switch 
was made, said Cathie, “we met 
with officers from all three 
branches every two weeks.” 
Cathie thinks that the Army
noticed improvements, too. “Two 
years ago,” he said, “they issued a 
report in which officers report to 
their commanding officers. The
1988 report said that there was 
no effort made by the University 
to go the extra mile. However, the
1989 report said that there now 
appears to be some sense of ur­
gency among the administration 
to go that extra mile.”
“I question the viability of the 
numerous actions that the Army 
has taken to reverse the negative 
trend at Carnegie Mellon,” said 
Cathie. “If we were under inten­
sive management, it is my under­
standing that the Army is sup­
posed to help the Carnegie Mel­
lon detachment. We did not see 
the help.”
“Where we are failing in Army,” 
Cathie said, “the antithesis is that 
we had the second largest schol­
arship group of all the Navy ROTC 
units. So as unsuccessful as we 
have been in Army, we have been 
just the opposite in the Navy. “ 
“Rather than [the Army] being 
able to face up to the political 
realities of having to make tough
decisions and making them stick, 
another strategy would be just to 
strangle [the program],” said Vice 
President for Enrollment William 
Elliott. “Then you’ve got the old 
chicken and egg: You don’t have 
the kids so therefore you don’t 
need the officers, but we can’t get 
the kids because we don’t have 
the officers.”
Students currently in the pro­
gram will continue training on 
campus for one more year under 
Del Re, who will answer to a pro­
fessor of military science at Pitt.
After the 1990-91 term, the stu­
dents who decide to continue 
Army ROTC will be cross-enrolled 
with Pitt’s Army ROTC and will 
have to take all Army classes at 
Pitt. No incoming freshmen will 
be accepted into the Army ROTC.

Smoking kindles fear, resentment in Financial Aid Office
continued from page 1
is the office area. Someone posted 
a sign late last week on the door of 
the office area designating it as a 
smoking area, in an apparent vio­
lation of University policy and 
city law.
This violation is not a new prob­
lem. City and university rules 
went into effect over a year ago, 
and smoking has gone on freely in 
the office for a while. “The people 
who are doing the smoking are 
Walter Cathie and two of the 
secretaries,” says Vice President 
for Enrollment Bill Elliott. “I’ve 
told [Cathie] not to smoke down 
there several times, many times.”
“I have a reputation of having a 
cigar in my hand, a well-earned 
one because I did,” says Associate 
Vice President for Financial Re­
sources Walter Cathie. “However, 
I quit about four months ago. 
That’s part of the reason I thought 
[last week’s letter to the editor] 
was dated.
“If it has to be changed, it will 
be changed,” Cathie told The 
Tartan Sunday. “I’ll have a chat 
with Dr. Elliott tomorrow morn­
ing.”
According to Police Chief James 
LaPaglia, “If someone in the area 
objects, then it can’t be a smoking 
area.”
The ordinance of Pittsburgh 
code that deals with regulating 
smoking is Chapter 617, title six, 
Article I. Under “Regulation of 
Smoking in Places of Employ­
ment” it states, “A work area 
separated from other work areas 
by floor to ceiling walls which is 
occupied exclusively by smokers, 
even though such work area may 
be visited by non-smokers, may 
be designated a smoking area.”
There are three smokers and 
five non-smokers who are based 
in the office area—four secretar­
ies in the common area, and the 
rest in their own offices. A num­
ber of part-time student employ­
ees also work in the common area. 
Of the non-smokers, there are 
some definite objections.
“I wish they had a separate 
lounge area for smoking,” says 
one non-smoker. “If you want to 
kill yourself, don’t take us with 
you.”
“Literally I have to do twice as 
much laundry because I’m in­
volved with the Financial Aid 
Office,” says another.
Two other non-smokers affili­
ated with the office point out that 
“It’s unbearable sometimes.” One 
cites periodic headaches as a re­
sult of the smoke.
Assistant Director of Financial 
Aid Paul Zimmerman has his own 
office off of the common area occu­
pied by the secretaries. As a re­
sult, he doesn’t have to deal with 
the smoke as much, but he says 
“I’m sure if I had to sit next to a 
desk out there it would bother 
me. I sympathize with them.”
As one non-smoker sees it, “The 
smokers’justification is that it is 
a really stressful environment and 
that because they’re helping stu­
dents, the least they feel they 
should be able to do is smoke.”
Joyce Walker, a loan coordina­
tor in the office, is a smoker. 
“People who smoke are really tired 
of being harassed,” she said. “I 
know smoking is not good for me, 
but they can’t set a law to tell me 
to quit smoking.”
Walker feels that “We’re all 
going to die some day, and I’m 
going to die happy, doing what I 
want to do. My father had seven 
massive heart attacks,” she con­
tinued, “and he was ‘buried’ six 
times. In all his heart attacks, he 
still smoked his cigarettes.”
Arleen Kern is the other smoker 
in the office. “I think people are 
blowing this way out of propor­
tion,” she says. “Our office is a

high stress area; if I had to leave 
to smoke, I wouldn’t have time for 
it. There is no other area in the 
building, anyway, so what are we 
supposed to do?”
Both Kern and Walker feel that 
the smoking issue is insignificant 
in light of other problems. “Do 
you know Warner Hall is polluted 
with asbestos, what does that do 
for your lungs?” asks Walker. 
“Driving through the Fort Pitt 
tunnels behind a PAT bus, you’re 
getting that smoke. You walk 
outside your door and its hazard­
ous to your health. You eat candy 
with red dye #2 and it’s hazard­
ous to your health. You see the 
garbage in the city water—we’re 
paying for that water.” 
According to the Pittsburgh City 
Smoking Control Ordinance,

based on U.S. Surgeon General 
findings, “The right of smokers 
ends where their actions affects 
the health, well-being, and com­
fort of others.” Health hazards in­
duced by breathing in secondhand 
smoke “include lung cancer, res­
piratory infection, decreased ex­
ercise tolerance, decreased respi­
ratory function, bronchoconstric- 
tion, and bronchospam.”
Non-smokers feel a definite 
apprehension to speaking out. “I 
work there and I know the views 
and whose views would be taken 
into account — they wouldn’t be 
mine,” says one non-smoker. “The 
upper-level people get what they 
want.”
The roots of apprehension go 
far beyond that, however. “We 
can’t say things if we want to
work,” said one anonymous em­
ployee. “I was advised that if I 
said anything, I should find an­
other job.”
Cathie finds this very surpris­
ing. “If you look at the people who 
work there, we’ve got good morale 
and the people have been there a 
long time. We don’t have a turn­
over problem,” he said.
“We really have some good open 
door policies around our place,” 
Cathie said. He cites Elliott and 
President Richard Cyert as op­
tions for venting discontent.
According to LaPaglia, enforce­
ment of the smoking regulations 
is the responsibility of the depart­
ment heads and their superiors. 
“It’s not Security’s responsibility. 
We could intervene if necessary 
— but it’s not the general proce­
dure.”
In the case of the Financial Aid 
office, Elliott is Cathie’s superior. 
“You’re the first person who Has 
complained,” Elliott told The Tar­
tan. “I’ve complained a lot, -so 
obviously I have to do something 
else.” He is unsure, however, as to 
what action he will take.
The Financial Aid Office’s 
smoking violations are now in the 
spotlight. But according to Assis­
tant Dean of Student Affairs Rcfe 
Campana, smoking violations are 
a problem throughout the cam­
pus.
“My general impression is tKat 
there has been an awful lot of 
resistance to the University smok­
ing regulations. It doesn’t seejn 
like all the department heads £fe 
enforcing the rules,” he said.

Housing Office selects groups for special interest houses
By MARK HALL
Tartan Staffwriter
JLC
The Housing Office last Wednesday 
confirmed seven special interest houses 
for the 1990-91 school year. The Asian 
Student Association, Hillel, Men’s Cross 
Country, and the National Society of 
Black Engineers will occupy the four 
special interest houses in the Margaret 
Morrison complex, according to Amy 
(Anther, assistant director of housing.
the new residence hall will house three 
other special interest groups, namely, 
the Women’s Military Interest Group, 
the Korean Christian Fellowship, and
"Special interest houses must provide at 
least two activities: one social and one edu­
cational.”
— Amy Ginther,
___________________assistant director of housing
Prism, which she described as “an inter- 
cultural, inter-religious organization.” 
The Margaret Morrison special inter­
est houses are four-bedroom, eight-per­
son apartments, each with a kitchen and
a living room. Two eight-person houses 
and one seven-person house, all without 
kitchens, are in the new residence hall.
The goal of the Housing Office in pro­
viding special interest housing os to pro­
vide residents with an opportunity to use 
the residence life experience to further 
specific educational goals.
According to Ginther, “Special inter­
est houses must provide at least two 
activities: one social and one educational.” 
Hillel House typifies the special inter­
est house concept. It is being established 
by CMU’s chapter of Alpha Epsilon Pi 
fraternity in conjunction with the B’nai 
B’rith Hillel Foundation of Pittsburgh: a 
cultural, religious, and educational in­
stitution for Jewish students.
According to Evan Indianer, president 
of Carnegie Mellon AEPi, Hillel House’s 
functions will be to provide services and
on-campus kitchen facilities for kosher 
meals. According to Cindy Goodman- 
Leib of the Hillel Foundation, Hillel 
prepares kosher food as part of all their 
programming; however, bringing the food 
to campus for special services from the 
Foundation’s location on North Craig 
Street has been inconvenient.
Bryan Wu, vice president of the Asian 
Student Association, is pleased that ASA 
will retain a special interest house.
“ASA has been growing rapidly in the 
past few years.... It's been hard to organ­
ize communication,” he said. “This year 
[1989-90] we got the ASA house, which 
provided a central point for the club.”
MIT nominee declines presidency; CMU search on track
continued from page 1
March meeting. According to MIT’s stu­
dent newspaper, The Tech, the Corpora­
tion will instead discuss how it should 
resume the search process, which had 
previously been suspended.
The possibility of not having selected a 
president by June 30 doesn’t seem to 
have occurred to the MIT search group; 
no mention of any contingency plan was 
made until after Sharp’s announcement.
In a statement released shortly after 
Sharp’s withdrawal, however, MIT Presi­
dent Paul E. Gray said that the Corpora­
tion could extend his term and that of 
Corporation Chair David S. Saxon be­
yond July 1 if necessary. Gray is step­
ping down from the MIT presidency to 
Replace Saxon, who must retire because 
lie is 70, as chair of the MIT Corporation.
; Carnegie Mellon President Richard M. 
Cyert says that MIT’s searches tend to 
concentrate on internal candidates. 
They tend to be internally oriented,” he 
said. “They have a large number of people 
iip there to choose from. Their faculty 
must be two or three times the size of 
burs.”
i But Cyert says that internal emphasis 
may change given recent events. “My 
feeling is that they’re probably going to 
have to go outside [of MIT], but maybe 
they’ve got another candidate inside 
that’s a possibility.”
According to The Tech, there are at 
ieast two candidates on MIT’s short list 
who may be reconsidered. One of those 
two candidates is a professor of econom­
ics at MIT, Paul L. Joskow; the other is 
the dean of the School of Engineering at 
Stanford University, James E. Gibbons.
Gibbons formerly held the position of a 
favored candidate in the Carnegie Mel­
lon search, but later backed out of the 
Search before any formal offer was made. 
“I don’t have any intense desire to be 
president of any institution,” Gibbons 
fold The Tartan last month.
! Despite his waning interest in the 
Carnegie Mellon presidency, however, 
The Tech reported that Gibbons remained 
a candidate in the MIT search until just 
a few weeks ago. After MIT’s decision to 
nominate Sharp, a source close to Gib­
bons told The Tech that although Gib­
bons might have accepted a post at MIT,
he would probably stay at Stanford.
Gibbons’ disinterest in the Carnegie 
Mellon presidency doesn’t seem to bother 
those close to the CMU search, even 
though he appears to have remained 
interested in the MIT post after he 
dropped out of the search here.
“If Gibbons were interested anywhere,” 
said Carnegie Mellon Trustee William 
Goldsmith, who is involved with the 
Trustee Search Committee, “it would be 
there.”
“It’s pretty tough to get a guy to move 
to Pittsburgh,” said Hans Lange, an­
other member of the Trustee Search 
Committee.
Cyert, who spoke with Gibbons last 
semester here, said that the status of 
Gibbons’ candidacy at MIT was un­
changed. “He was intrigued with the 
position,” said Cyert. “Leaving [Stan­
ford] might enable him to be more of 
spokesman for science and technology. 
MIT seems to be touting their job as that, 
and that may appeal to him.”
Gibbons wasn’t the only high level 
candidate to withdraw from CMU’s 
search. Last December, Faculty Search 
Committee member Otto Davis told The 
Tartan that two short list candidates 
from MIT withdrew from the CMU search 
because ofthe search thatwas thenbeing 
conducted at MIT.
Amid controversy surrounding his 
candidacy, one of those two candidates, 
MIT Provost John Deutch, later an­
nounced that he was no longer a candi­
date at MIT. Parts of the MIT commu­
nity were dissatisfied with Deutch’s 
performance as provost there.
Cyert said that Deutch is not active in 
the Carnegie Mellon search.
But he also thinks that Deutch may 
still be in the running for the MIT post. 
“If I were [MIT], I’d go after Deutch and 
try to convince him to come back,” he 
said. “He may no longer be willing to do 
that.”
Though the MIT search, according to 
Cyert, tends to concentrate on internal 
candidates, Carnegie Mellon’s presiden­
tial search is not closely examining any 
candidates from within the University. 
That is not to say, however, that it will 
not in the future. “I’d like to see it done,” 
says Cyert.

Lange says that the committees are 
still in the process of building what will 
be their second short list. But he stressed 
that there is no single source of competi­
tion with which the Carnegie Mellon 
search must contend.
The search has entered into its second 
year as Cyert’s planned June 30 retire­
ment approaches. Since the onset, Cyert
has indicated a willingness to stay on as 
president “as long as it takes” to find a 
person to take his job. “I don’t want 
anybody to be chosen in a hurry or in a 
panic,” he said. “I want the person to be 
chosen with a lot of thought.”
Cyert said that he is not aware of any 
candidates right now who are in a lead 
position. But he also pointed out that he
is not involved with all aspects of the 
search; he said that he usually doesn’t 
meet with a candidate until the second 
or third time that the candidate is on 
campus.
Though he hasn’t met with any candi­
dates since he met with Gibbons last fall, 
Cyert said that he expects to meet with 
some candidates in the near future.

Snags squelch progress of Pittsburgh Technology Center

eral planned atrium spaces. The exterior 
surface of the building was also restyled, 
with “in and out” grooves along the sur­
face being “smoothed” to reduce the total 
surface area.
The attempts at cost reduction have 
failed, however, because even with these 
measures, plans still exceed the allotted 
budget. “We made a variety of attempts 
in order to bring costs within a reason­
able amount, and were unsuccessful in 
achieving an adequate cost reduction,” 
said Director of Mellon Institute Dr. 
William M. Kaufman. “We could not fit 
our program into a building at the alloca­
tion.” It was soon after the cancellation 
of this building that Carnegie Mellon’s 
former director of Real Estate Develop­
ment Sandra J. Hemmingway resigned.
The new plan is to develop a single 
building with the Oxford Development 
Company which would house both Mel­
lon Institute’s research activities, as well
as those of the tenants in Oxford’s por­
tion of the building. Kaufman explained 
that the money granted by the state 
would be used to purchase CMITs area of 
the building, with extra space being 
rented as necessary. “CMU would own in 
a condominium fashion what the 17 
million would pay for,” said Kaufman. 
“And what we don’t own, but still need to 
occupy because of the program size, we 
will rent from Oxford. So we will be 
partly an owner of the building and partly 
a tenant.”
Meanwhile, the results of a routine 
environmental impact study have raised 
concerns that the PTC site’s soil is con­
taminated with cyanide. Although the 
initial report on the site found nothing 
abnormal, the Department of Environ­
mental Resources asked for more sam­
pling, which was conducted over Christ­
mas. Based on this new sampling, the 
DER found that certain areas of the 
ground had levels of cyanide contamina­
tion which it felt had to be managed in 
some fashion.
The area where the University of Pitts­
burgh intends to build was given a clean 
slate, however. According to Jerome 
Schultz, director of the Center for Bioen­
gineering and Biotechnology at Pitt, “the 
examination of the piece of property that 
the building will be constructed on did 
not show initial levels of toxic material 
that would be of a concern in terms of 
building.”
Carnegie Mellon’s proposed site is 
among those still in question. In response 
to further requests by the DER, the URA 
has contracted for a new and more com­
plete round of testing, the results of 
which won’t be known for several weeks.
The question for CMU with regard to 
the testing centers around a massive 
concrete slab some 8 to 12 feet under­
ground, which served as part of the foun­
dation for the old mill. It is believed that 
much of the contamination may be cen­
tered under the slab, thus creating ques­
tions as to whether it should be removed. 
This is cause for concern, because pre­
liminary designs for the Oxford/CMU 
building used the slab as an integral part 
of the foundation.
“In the earlier plans the slab was going 
to be left in place,” said Kaufman. “If the 
material (concrete slab) has to be re­
moved, that’s a whole new problem. Until 
those things are resolved you can’t make 
many more plans.”
Pitt’s next step will be a process of con­
struction bidding to be conducted by the 
Department of General Services (DGS). 
Though the funds for construction have 
not yet been released from the state, 
Johnson felt that the process should 
commence very soon. “I imagine that’s 
imminent,” said Johnson.
Pitt received $14 million from the state, 
which it will use to construct an 87,000 
square foot facility to house its biotech­
nology and bioengineering programs.
Johnson said that the University has 
carefully borne that allocation in mind 
when designing the building. “We’ve 
scaled the building to meet that cost,” he 
said.
Johnson feels the whole process has 
been a bit more protracted than neces­
sary. “We’re somewhat disappointed that 
its a little bit slower than we expected. I 
think the questions about the site could 
have been handled earlier in the proc­
ess,” he said. “But given that you have 
three state agencies, two universities, 
and two developers, that tends to make 
things go slower, not faster. Just trying 
to get meetings sometimes with these 
people sometimes slows things down.”
Asked whether or not any work could 
be done on the CMU building in the in­
terim, Kaufman responded that “con­
ceivably some could be, but the real ques­
tion is do you want to spend any time, 
effort, and money on addressing issues 
that might end up being a waste of time.”

City considers 6% tax
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan Editor-in-Chief
As The Tartan went to press Sun­
day, the Pittsburgh media reported 
that the city is considering implement­
ing a six percent tax on research grants 
awarded to universities.
The tax, which would affect only 
CMU and Pitt, would have cost CMU 
about $724,200 last year, The Pitts­
burgh Press reported Sunday.
“Taxing research would reduce the 
University’s ability to function as a 
major economic generator,” President 
Richard Cyert told the Press. “We are 
legally tax exempt and I would vigor­
ously oppose any effort to cheat on 
that.”
City officials don’t expect to seri­
ously consider the issue until later this 
year, the Press reported.
Keating
promoted
Volumle84 MioS ,Is8 ;
take a look and see how we might 
want to restructure the division,” 
he said. “Maybe we’ll be taking 
some things out and putting them 
in other places.”
“What we need to do is look 
hard at how things are organized, 
look at the set of people and re­
sponsibilities, and delegate re­
sponsibilities so that it does be­
come a ‘do-able’job,” Keatingsaid. 
“The president has asked myself 
and Bill Elliott to look at some of 
the things in the organization and 
see if we can’t come up with some 
ideas. Since Rogers won’t be leav­
ing until July, we have four 
months to really take our time 
and look at this before we make 
any changes.... I want to take time 
to learn about the organization 
and analyze what’s there and 
what we can do.”
Cyert said that one way that 
the combined position might be 
made more manageable is by 
moving some responsibilities to 
other divisions. One concrete 
possibility he mentioned was 
moving the Housing Office, which 
currently falls under Business 
Affairs, under Elliott in Enroll­
ment. Elliott already has respon­
sibilities for the Division of Stu­
dent Affairs; Cyert thinks that 
associating Student Affairs and 
the Residence Life program in 
the Housing Office could be bene­
ficial. “I’d like to see that,” he 
said.
Cyert and Keating seem to agree 
that the consolidation of the two 
divisions into one post is a good 
idea. “It’s going to bring the budg­
eting and planning processes 
closer together and will give us a 
closer tie to the academic units,” 
says Keating.
Keating’s preliminary ideas 
about the functions of the posi­
tion of head of the newly unified 
divisions are to try to provide a 
certain “level of service” to the 
deans, the academic units, and 
the students, and to try to assist 
the president, the vice presidents, 
and the deans in financial deci­
sions.
“I think the biggest challenge 
will come from our future.... Pri­
vate higher education — higher 
education in general — is becom­
ing more constrained. That’ll be a 
challenge,” he says. “It’s going to 
be a time of choices and priori­
ties.”
Keating will still be heading up 
the University Center project, 
although the day-to-day opera­
tion of the project will have to be 
turned over to someone else.

FORUM
Smoke chokes Warner Hall
Two years ago, members of 
Pittsburgh’s City Council decided 
that “the right of smokers to smoke 
ends where their action affects 
the health, well-being, and com­
fort of others.”
Maybe the occupants of Warner 
Hall should take the hint.
Prompted by a letter to the edi­
tor we ran last week, The Tartan 
investigated smoking in the Fi- 
¦ nancial Aid Office. We found out 
that at least three full-time secre­
taries — plus a handful of work- 
study students—are being forced 
to work in an uncomfortable and 
harmful environment.
By law, a work area can be a 
“designated smoking area” only if 
it is separated from other work 
areas by floor to ceiling walls, and 
if it is occupied exclusively by 
smokers.
The decision to smoke is a per­
sonal one that everyone has a right 
to make, but only for himself or 
herself. If you smoke in an area 
you share with others, you’re 
making the decision for them, too.
Don’t do it.
Aside from breaking the law and
professional relationships with 
those around you. And you’re also 
creating a very uncomfortable 
situation for those who work with 
you, or, in some cases, for you.
The law protects non-smokers 
from being pressured into waiv­
ing their rights — a designated 
smoking area must be occupied 
only by smokers, not by smokers 
and consenting non-smokers.
If smokers aren’t sensitive to 
the rights of their non-smoking 
co-workers, then perhaps the 
University needs to recognize 
those rights and protect them 
better than it has so far. We want 
something a little stronger than 
just a “wait-and-see” attitude from 
Warner Hall and Campus Police.
Our immediate motivation in 
pushing this point is to protect 
the rights of non-smoking employ­
ees in Financial Aid. The bigger 
picture:the whole University 
needs to clean up its act — and its 
air.
If the University can’t take the 
hint it got two years ago in the 
form of a city ordinance, maybe 
the Pittsburgh Police should de­
liver the next one to Warner Hallposing a health risk to others 
you’re strainingyour personal and personally.

Don’t you wish you could take a

pect to have the privilege of a

graduates had that opportunity from positions of authority. For
this past week.
Sir Michael Knight, a former 
British representative to NATO 
and retired British air chief 
marshall — the equivalent of an 
American four-star general — 
lectured on European events each 
night last week for a total of eleven- 
and-a-half hours. Student re­
sponse was highly favorable.
According to Knight himself, the 
one-unit lecture series, which 
included no final paper, examina­
tion, or grade, was a guinea pigfor 
future lecture series.
Well, the guinea pig is in excep­
tional shape, and we’re cheering 
for an encore.
Carnegie Mellon, as the admini­
stration will readily tell you, holds 
a prestigious position in the eyes 
of the nation. President Cyert and 
others will even go so as far to say 
that the image extends worldwide.
Let’s use it.

Editor:
I am writing this in 
response to Matthew 
Ruben’s attack on 
columnist Michael 
Drout in last week’s 
edition [“Columnist manipulated facts 
and ideas,” 2/20]. This is directed to­
wards everybody, but specifically to Mr. 
Ruben. Mr. Ruben, I think it’s clear 
that you have absolutely no respect for 
anyone’s personal thoughts or beliefs, 
except those that specifically agree with 
your own.
I don’t need anyone to tell me how to 
be diverse; my principles are different 
from everyone else’s in the entire world. 
We are all individuals — how can you 
suggest that we need to increase diver­
sity when we’re already different from 
each other? To show how we’re already 
diverse in our own ways, I’ll describe 
myself as an example.
I come from an upper-middle class 
community in North Central New Jer­
sey. My town is about 80 percent Repub­
lican, yet I registered as a Democrat when 
I turned 18.1 think thathad the full story 
been told, President Reagan would have 
faced impeachment for the Iran-Contra 
affair. I would have voted for Thomas 
Kean, the former governor of New Jersey 
and a Republican, had he been able to run 
again. I love reading and listening to 
William F. Buckley, even though I dis­
agree with just about everything he says. 
I don’t particularly like the fact that there 
are so many nuclear weapons in the world, 
but I don’t think we should get rid of them 
either. I thought (and still think) that the 
INF Treaty was a bad idea. I think we 
shouldn’t have let Ayatollah Khomeini 
die of natural causes. I’m a total hater of 
Mario Lemieux, a potentially dangerous 
belief in Pittsburgh. I really don’t care 
what homosexuals do, as long as they 
leave me alone. I think that burning the 
American flag is terribly wrong, but I 
don’t think the government should do 
anything to stop it. I think the best way to
reduce the deficit is to increase revenue,
i.e., raise taxes. I don’t think the govern­
ment cares enough about public educa­
tion. I think we’d be better off keeping 
the U.S. military at its present strength, 
but should cancel totally unnecessary 
things like SDI. I’m glad to see that an 
institution like SEI is part of Carnegie 
Mellon — I think it’s great that the 
government sees the mental resources of 
Carnegie Mellon as extremely beneficial 
to our country. I think women should be 
allowed into combat billets in the Armed 
Forces, providing they can meet the 
same physical standards as men. I put 
ketchup on my scrambled eggs. I think 
that it’s a sin to put corned beef on white 
bread. I think that Coke tastes better 
than Pepsi. I think that Paul Simon and 
J.S. Bach are the two greatest compos­
ers. I think the Macintosh is a better 
computer than the IBM. I think dark 
chocolate is better than milk chocolate. I 
think Yoo-hoo is a disgusting concoction.

ID Center partly responsible for fraud
Editor: Is- oi
After reading your i«™.«..
front page story, ------ —
[“Fraud prompts Letter tO 
change in emergency the Edjto|. 
loan policy, 2/20], I 
feel that it is necessary to respond to a 
major inconsistency in the way admin- 
istraton handled the problem.
On December 7, an unknown person 
came into the ID Center, paid $7, and 
received a CMU ID without any identi­
fication taken or duplicate photos kept.
This ID now allows the man to visit our 
gym, enter our dorms, borrow computer 
software or library books, and take out 
emergency loans.
As a result of the fraud, the Student 
Affairs Office is changing its policy on 
giving out emergency loans? Get a clue! It 
sounds like the ID Center needs to stop 
passing out IDs to just anybody who comes 
in with $7 and a fake social security num­
ber.
Also, students can help the problem by 
taking better care of their IDs. I know
people who boast about being on their 
seventh ID. That means six people could 
be walking around this campus and tak­
ing out emergency loans and computer 
software under your name.
Let’s see the ID Center shape up. A 
valid CMU ID should mean that the 
owner is a current CMU student, and 
thus the chance to defraud the admini­
stration is lessened.

Editor:
I applaud Student 
Senate’s new policies 
designed to reduce 
clutter on the bulle­
tin boards around 
campus. However, I am appalled at how 
quickly and flagrantly they have vio­
lated their own rules.
Whoever was responsible for the re­
cent postering campaign for the Stu­
dent Senate Open House at Scotland
Yard broke the rules many times. I no­
ticed at least eight or so posters attached 
to the main entrance of Doherty Hall and 
several posters in the stairwells of Wean 
Hall.
In addition, Trina Pundurs mentioned 
on the Andrew bboard “cmu.policy” that 
she was surprised to find that her office 
door had been declared an authorized 
bulletin board.
I’ll concede that by Friday night (after 
the event was almost over) most of the
illicit posters were gone from Doherty 
and Baker, but they still remained in 
Wean.
My question is: Will Student Senate 
fine itself $100+ for breaking its own 
rules?
I find it discouraging that the first 
major violation of the new postering 
rules is by the organization that created 
them.

brary for the past two 
school years. When I 
began to work here, I was amazed to 
find that CMU faculty do not pay over­
due fines. Despite the fact that they 
receive books for a six-month period (as 
opposed to students’ three-week bor­
rowing privileges), professors and their 
assistants are not expected to be re­
sponsible enough to return books on 
time. While faculty members are charged 
for the books they lose, their depart­
ments may elect to pay the replacement 
costs, so students end up paying for 
books misplaced by professors.
This outrageous policy causes many 
problems, mostly for students. Without 
the threat of fines, professors are under 
no obligation to return books desper­
ately needed by students or other pro­
fessors, and they frequently ignore our 
attempts to recall these items. Also, 
hounding professors about recalls and 
lost items occupies staff members whose 
time and salaries could be better used 
keeping the library in shape or helping to 
serve libraiy patrons,
The official explanation for faculty 
exemption from fines is that this is a 
professional courtesy to people who check 
out books frequently for class use. How­
ever, students must do the same, and 
they are charged fines. Institutions such 
as Pitt have no problem making profes­
sors pay fines on loan periods that are 
identical to students’. The fact that CMU 
does not charge professors for their irre­
sponsibility makes a mockery of the idea 
that the library exists to further stu­
dents’ educations.
This is not a minor problem. I decided 
last week to write this after I had to 
inform a professor who was checking out 
a book that he had over ninety overdue
items, sixty of which were listed as “lost 
by patron,” with replacement costs that 
exceeded $2,500. He laughed at this, sol 
doubt that he will be returning any of 
these any time soon. It is due to cas^s 
like this that many student workers have 
given up informing professors about 
overdue items rather than suffer sar­
casm or abuse.
Until professors are charged for their 
negligence, the official claim that stu­
dents are charged fines as a deterrent 
rather than a revenue-raising measure 
is exposed as false. All students at CMU. 
even those who have never checked a 
book out of a University library, 
paying for this policy, from the incon­
veniences it causes when looking for 
books to the higher tuition that it forces 
upon them.

Alcohol does not excuse fraternity from personal responsibility
Editor:
A few weeks 
ago, a few 
friends and I Letter tO 
were the vie- thfi 
tims of a very
unfortunate incident which 
should not go unnoticed. There 
; are basically five of us who go out 
; together every weekend, but one 
night, four of us, all H&SS fresh- 
men, went out to the fraternities.
; We were having a great time until 
we got to Beta Theta Pi.
We were drinking and dancing 
; and everything was fine. Some- 
; how, we got separated, and I was 
; standing by myself near the bar.
; Then I felt someone bump into 
; me; or maybe I bumped into him.
; It was very crowded, and this was 
•T expected. I turned around to 
! apologize, but before I could utter 
! a word, there was a guy yelling in 
: my face. “What’s your problem?” 
he asked. “Do you have a prob- 
lem? Do you want to get the fuck
out of here?” I couldn’t even reply 
throughout his verbal assault. 
Finally, I got a hold of myself and 
began to argue back.
Whether or not my own argu­
ments had anything to do with 
the atrocity that unfolded, I will 
never know. Something tells me 
that what was about to happen 
would have occurred even if I had 
professed my sincerest apologies. 
Before I knew it, this person 
grabbed my arm and twisted it 
behind my back. He then shoved 
me towards the stairs. At this 
point I was so stunned that I was 
slow to react. I began to struggle, 
but I did not nearly match his 
strength and I am sure he was 
very well aware of this. The next 
thing I knew, I was shoved against 
the wall and about seven guys 
were surrounding me saying vile 
and crude remarks such as, “Get 
out, cunt. You fucking pussy, get 
out of our fucking house.”
Judging from these comments,
I assumed that the rest of these 
guys were members of Beta, along 
with the one who was still shov­
ing me against the wall. I had 
never dealt with an incident like 
this before, and I shouldn’t have 
had to. We are all here because 
we are considered to be intelli­
gent people, but the way these 
men were acting was hardly in­
telligent. In fact, it was barbaric 
and uncontrollable.
My friends finally saw what was 
going on, and one of them ran 
over and screamed and began to 
drag me out of the circle. My other 
two friends ran over and we be­
gan working our way to the stairs, 
which was not easy. There was 
only one brother in the whole 
house who was attempting to at 
least calm down the incident. He 
helped me get to the door, since I 
could not have possibly gotten 
past all of those screaming guys. 
This is one thing that still con­
fuses me. The brother who shoved
me, whose name I later found out 
is Jeff Caringola, was screaming 
at me to get out, yet made no 
attempt to get me to the door.
At this point I was so humili­
ated that I just wanted to crawl 
under a rock. A lot of people were 
staring at me, and there were 
quite a few brothers screaming 
profanities and acting like a bunch 
of animals. Finally, the helpful 
brother (I could not find out his 
name, but I would have liked to 
thank him for at least helping me 
get out) was getting our jackets. I 
looked down the stairs at the door, 
and realized there was no way I 
could leave that way. Caringola 
was standing on a chair right by 
the door screaming more obsceni­
ties, along withmany other broth­
ers. It seemed as if he was enjoy­
ing himself by picking on some­
one who could not really do much 
to retaliate. One of my friends 
was standing down at the bottom 
of the stairs next to the chair.
Talking to her later, I found out 
something which really added to 
my anger and frustration. At this 
point, one of them proceeded to 
tell her, “They are all really drunk. 
She just has to get out of here. All 
she can do is leave.” Being drunk 
is no excuse to act like some sort 
of rabid animal who has no con­
cern for others. My friends and I 
drink on many occasions, but 
never have we assaulted another 
person. Eventually, I was escorted 
out of the fraternity through a 
side door since I could not possi­
bly leave through the front door. 
At this point I was hysterically 
sobbing, and my friends had to 
take me home and calm me down.
I look back on this incident and 
become completely enraged. I 
went to Ron Campana, head of 
Greek life, and reported the inci­
dent. He made all sorts of prom­
ises, and I kept on calling him to 
find out what was going to hap­
pen. I have now discovered that
he never had any intention of 
doing a thing. I have no idea why 
he would give us the run-around 
and make me think that some­
thing could be done, when, in 
actuality, no one really cares. For 
some odd reason, people, espe- 
daily certain fraternity brothers 
(I am not referring to all of them), 
feel that a drunken stupor gives 
them permission to manhandle 
other people. I’ll tell you one thing: 
Jeff, how dare you lay your hands 
on me and treat me like I am not 
even human. And to you Beta 
brothers, how you can encourage 
and allow that kind of behavior is 
beyond me. If you were true 
friends like you all claim, you 
would teach each other a few 
manners. But perhaps none of 
you have any.

in last week’s edition of The Tar- 
. tan [“Yawn, it’s another dull day 
on campus....,” 2/20].
I agree that there isn’t much 
new happening on campus right 
now, but I think Stew and The 
Tartan may be missing some 
. events that are happening. For 
.example, Stew states in his col­
umn that “we’ve been waiting for 
j names of the new president ... 
we’re waiting for the new dorm 
and fields to be finished.” He also 
1 , illustrates his desire for maybe a protest or two about issues such 
as tuition hikes, in order to make 
' better front page headlines. I
think the reason there are no 
complaints about these things is 
the fact that we have limited in­
formation about them.
Perhaps if The Tartan or Stew 
could do some in-depth progress 
reporting on the construction 
instead of simply pointing out that 
we are bored with waiting, stu­
dents could determine whether 
they would be justified in their 
complaints. As for tuition hikes, 
I’m sure most of us are against 
them, but maybe some informa­
tion about what exactly the Uni­
versity plans to do or how the 
Tuition Committee is handling 
things would be helpful. I believe 
The Tartan would have much to 
write about if it delved into some 
of these topics.
However, the part I disagree 
most with in Stew’s column is,
when giving examples of possible 
news, he cites “even a basketball 
team that wins a game” as some­
thing he hoped for.
I realize that this probably 
implies the men’s basketball 
team, but what some people may 
not know is that the women’s team 
has won games —17 to be exact
— along with a second consecu­
tive PAC Championship. I’m 
surprised Stew didn’t acknowl­
edge this, since he does almost all 
of the reporting for both basket­
ball teams. By not specifying men 
or women, it presented the mis­
conception to the readers that 
neither team has been success­
ful at all. Oh well, I guess maybe 
to Stew and some others, a PAC 
Championship is not really big 
news when it’s for the women. I’m 
sure, however, that people would

This letter is a 
commentary on 
your February 20 Letter tO 
article,“Chatham th<} £ditQf 
students fight 
against coed proposal,” by Josh 
Ruben. My belief is that all 
schools should be coeducational, 
for three reasons:
1. Every student, female or 
( male, is entitled to the best edu­
cation possible. Recently, there 
was an article in USA Today about 
Virginia Military Institute and 
other male-only schools possibly 
going coed. I applaud this whole­
heartedly. I believe that any stu­
dent that can “make the grade” at 
VMI should be admitted. 
Likewise, any student who has 
the ability to attend Chatham 
should be admitted.
2. Education is more than what 
you learn from textbooks. A good 
proportion of one’s education
: comes from interaction between
people. I believe that when a per­
son attends a single-sex institu­
tion, he or she is forsaking a cru­
cial part of his or her education. 
This is not idle pratter, because I 
went to an all-male high school. 
Although the education I received 
there was very good, it should 
have been made available to 
women also. I realize that I can­
not put myself in the position of 
the women at Chatham, but I do 
have an idea of what a single-sex 
school is like.
3. Whenpeople shutthemselves 
off (not necessarily completely) in 
single-sex schools, whether male- 
or female-only, they lose critical 
experience about inter-sex rela­
tions. When I say this I don’t 
mean the act of sex itself, but in­
stead the non-sexual situations 
men and women get into, espe­
cially in the workplace. I am not 
saying that the women who at­
tend Chatham are socially iso­
lated from either men or other

I don’t like to eat mushrooms. I 
think we could have won the 
Vietnam War. And, I definitely 
think many people think I’m 
strange for believing these things. 
Am I diverse enough for you, Mr. 
, Ruben?
j I think that the point Mr. Drout 
I was trying to convey — and cer­
tainly the one that I’m trying to— 
is that we don’t need anybody to 
tell us what to think about or how 
to think about it. Mr. Ruben, I’m 
8ure that you’d love the education 
system in the Soviet Union, where 
, children are taught exactly what 
. to think, or the system in Japan, 
.where students are taught to 
perform like little calculators, not 
thinking people. No one has any 
; right to tell or suggest to anyone 
how to think and what to think 
. about. Getting everyone to think 
-¡alike was Hitler’s goal when he 
restructured the German educa­
tion system in the 1930s, and was 
Stalin’s goal with his social 
^ “purges” of the late 1940s-early 
’1950s. Carnegie Mellon is a uni­
versity, and should therefore be
universal in thought, with every­
one believing what he chooses.
Mr. Ruben, how do you expect 
anyone to take a diversity pro­
gram seriously if it contradicts 
everything he believes? I have 
friends in CIT who tell me that 
the class “Tech and People” does 
basically that — I’ve yet to hear 
one person speak in favor of that 
class. I’d like to write what they 
call that class in this letter, but I 
can’t because it dosen’t fit with 
my concept of decent and proper 
journalism. Oh well, I guess that 
will just have to be a casualty of 
my diversity.
Not only that, but how do you 
expect the instructors of such a 
class to be impartial to those who 
disagree with them? I’m reasona­
bly sure that I’ve already received 
lower grades than I deserved for 
disagreeing with the instructor. 
Such a class would be one person’s 
preaching of their own personal 
ideology, not a course in diverse 
thought. The only way to get a 
true course in diversity would be 
to have everyone involved with it 
teach it—students and faculty (a 
bit impractical, isn’t it?) — but
appreciate it more were it a front 
page headline for all to see, in­
stead of being hiddenin the Sports 
section somewhere.
Hey, that would be something 
new. What would be wrong with 
using a sports story as a front­
page headline? Or even use some 
of the exciting world news that is 
currently going on? A campus 
newspaper does not have to deal 
specifically with campus events. 
I’m sure many students do not 
read local newspapers every day, 
and would like to know more about 
local and world news. I think 
maybe “Yawn, it’s another dull 
day on campus....” because some 
people like Stew make it that way.

this would happen. The same

there. The high caliber of the

because its admission standards 
would still be in effect. Therefore, 
if there would still be highly-

“MTV get off the air”
The Dead Kennedys
MTV came on air in the early 
1980s. Its first video was “Video 
Killed the Radio Star.” How right 
that turned out to be. Video be­
came a major player in making 
and breaking stars in the 1980s. I 
would wager money that most of 
today’s major bands would have 
found a hard time making it over 
the radio. Guns ‘N Roses is one 
example — they probably would 
have been considered heavy metal 
and not gotten very far with the 
average listener as they have. 
MTV has changed the way music 
is viewed and how bands are 
judged.
But MTV is not an unmitigated
Rich Robinson
good. Rather, I would consider it 
to be narrowing the range of music 
that is available to see or listen to.
Yet even with the huge selec­
tion, MTV could at least cater to 
more than mainstream money 
makers. Accountants run what is 
in and out. If something will make 
money, it goes on. If it is uncer­
tain, you and I will never see it 
because they don’t want to take 
chances over such things.
The same music is regurgitated 
over and over. What new “bands” 
have learned is that what they 
look like can make or break them. 
If the band is glamorous and can 
attract the segment of women who 
like bands for their looks, as well 
as the listeners who like a band 
that seems “cool,” it is on the road 
to fame. Though its fame may die 
soon, the band usually can have 
one huge hit album to rest on.
MTV has become a mediator of 
mediocrity. It claims to play new 
music — but only the new music 
that will be popular. It has new 
age music on Sunday night, late, 
and most of it is either not current
or mainstream popular — noth­
ing new and experimental. It has 
Headbanger’s Ball, but that is 
more Bon Jovi-type rock than 
metal.
They’ve gotten rid of so many 
good things. The old VJs were at 
least original and not such slaves 
to fashion. They used to have 
such things as Basement Tapes 
where new bands could get a break 
nationally and have a chance of 
being “discovered.” Videos used 
to concentrate more on the band 
and music than on image and 
styles. Today, they don’t have to 
have talent — just the looks to 
make them a hit. Look at Milli 
Vinilli—no real talent, just some 
dreadlocks and dancing. Yet 
they’ve won various awards 
(mostly MTV ones).
Radio, though it has some main­
stream stations, has more choices. 
There are college and syndicated 
stations where you can hear punk 
bands, metal, less popular rock, 
experimental music, and classic 
rock. All bases are covered with 
little fluff and more substance. 
Bands can be judged by their 
music, not their hairdresser and 
makeup.
It is the eventual evolution of 
TV, however. To stay alive on 
national TV, it costs a lot more
than a small radio station. For 
TV, there are a lot more rules, as 
well. And image is more impor­
tant. Who would watch a soap 
opera that uses wooden cut-out 
cars and out-of-style actors and 
actresses?
MTV was a bold idea, but what 
it has regressed to is not what I 
believe it set out to be. A few 
music TV channels cannot hold 
the weight of the massive amount 
of band material available. And 
when this happens, music is nar­
rowed to those bands which are 
sure things. This narrowing lim­
its our choices, as bands lately 
have to have a video to keep alive. 
Radio stations are beginning to 
take bands from MTV’s example, 
while smaller labels and starting 
bands are getting nudged out.
Because it is on TV, MTV is 
subject to the whim of trends and 
fashions of the moment. And to be 
a good band, they must take these 
things into account, which makes 
the trend last longer and become 
commonplace. You may want your 
MTV, but I don’t want it at the 
cost of losing really good bands 
that didn’t cut the money-making 
requirement.

Freshman class lacks motivation from the University
Something is wrong with the 
current freshman class. Rumor 
has it that almost forty percent of 
the class is on academic proba­
tion — the worst these figures 
have been in the history of CMU. 
So many of the freshman I know 
seem to display no enthusiasm 
for Carnegie Mellon. In the dorms, 
on the way to class, and in the 
computer clusters, there are only 
long faces and unhappiness. The 
standard topic of conversation in 
a dorm I was in the other day was 
how many friends were failing 
out and where they would go. I 
think I heard the word “transfer” 
more times in that one day than 
in the previous four years. I can­
not remember such a generally 
negative feeling on campus since
60 Coarse
“VK
Michael Drout
my freshman year, right after the 
Van Mastrigt murder. What is 
the matter? What is Carnegie 
Mellon as a school or we as Carne­
gie Mellon students doing wrong?
The first and greatest problem 
the freshman class seems to be 
facing is that of feeling over­
looked. From day one, the fresh­
men have been told, “Things are 
going to be great — too bad you 
came to school the wrong year.” 
The promised new dorm, stadium, 
and IM fields were not finished on 
time. And while CMU is spending
tons of money to build a suppos­
edly wonderful new student cen­
ter, it won’t be done, or even 
started, for years. I can easily see 
people envisioning CMU as one 
big broken promise.
The second problem is, I be­
lieve, the way freshman orienta­
tion/camp was handled. First of 
all, the basic logistics of three 
widely separated campsites con­
tributed to a fragmentation of the 
class instead of its unification. 
There were other problems devel­
oped by the use of set “groups,” 
rather than the informal gather­
ings around counselors that had 
been the norm in the past. Since 
orientation took place before 
camp, there was the distinct pos­
sibility of the separation of new
friends. Therefore, friendships did 
not grow as rapidly as when I was 
a freshman.
Third, the entire philosophy of 
freshman orientation was skewed. 
Instead of concentrating on in- 
oculatingincoming students with 
unity and school spirit, the pro­
gram concentrated on their “Di­
versity.” The diversity of CMU’s 
student body is certainly a strong 
point. It is a wonderfully positive 
aspect of life at CMU that we 
have such a multiplicity of cul­
tures and beliefs; but stressing 
differences rather than similari­
ties is a stupid way to run an 
orientation. Unity should have 
been the theme, with stress on 
spirit and friendship. From the 
very beginning, the freshmen
should have been encouraged to 
think of themselves as a unified 
whole. However, this was not 
done, and the current class is 
feeling the results.
While other colleges concentrate 
on simply getting the students 
together in an atmosphere of fun 
and games for a week, CMU tried 
to teach “human relations” and 
“Diversity” in an overly-intellec- 
tual attempt to indoctrinate stu­
dents with “guidelines for a bet­
ter world” or some other fuzzy- 
headed nonsense. And to what 
effect? Instead of providing a real 
spirit of community that would 
eliminate the problems that 
“Diversity” attempts to address, 
we end up with a fragmented 
student body, secure inits cliques.
Unfortunately, I don’t have a 
quick fix for this problem. I don’t 
know how the wrongs of fresh­
man camp can be righted. I don’t 
know what will academically 
motivate the freshman. My only 
suggestion is that the University 
let the freshman class know that 
it cares they exist. Some money, 
time, and energy should be spent 
on them. Forty percent of the stu­
dent body failing out would be the 
biggest disaster this campus has 
ever seen. Something has to be 
done, an attempt to right wrongs, 
even if it is only a bunch of wild 
stabs in the dark.

The best thing you’ve ever done 
for me
Is to help me take life less seri­
ously, it’s only life after all.
“The way to break out is to take 
a long look inward. I guess some­
thing has to trigger it. You must 
be far enough away from the 
event, physically and emotionally, 
and something’s got to happen, 
something that brings up all these 
conflicts, something that hurts. 
You find someone who you want
to trust, someone that attracts 
you on some really basic, wonder­
ful level. It hurts, but you know 
you need it.”
Well darkness has a hunger 
that’s insatiable 
And lightness has a call that’s 
hard to hear 
I wrap my fear around me like a 
blanket
I sailed my ship of safety until I 
sank it,
I’m crawling on your shore.
“So you hurt for a while, and 
you trust, and you think, and you 
hold onto someone. And it hap­
pens, and you suddenly realize 
just who you are, and what you’ve 
done to yourself, and it’s so easy, 
so easy...”
“All it takes is the right shock, 
and all those years of hiding and 
pretending and lying are gone, 
and you feel so much better.”
Blue eyes, a smile.
“It feels so good to accept your­
self for who you are. But, when 
you look around, it’s surprising 
how many people there are out 
there who are mad, or afraid, or 
confused, because they haven’t. 
And the really sad thing is that 
it’s so easy, the actual action. Just 
a thought, just telling yourself 
who you are. And everything is a 
lot better, a lot calmer. No more 
anger, all those years of hurting 
deep down are finally gone.”
“You come out of it feeling 
amazingly close to the person who 
helped you through all this, who 
just held your hand.”
Quick glance, blue eyes to green.
“In love?”
“Nah, even better. In trust.”

At CMU, basketball gets no respect
There will be no “March Mad­
ness” at Carnegie Mellon.
Then again, there was no “Feb­
ruary Frenzy” or “December 
Dementia” either. The basketball 
season has come and gone and 
the campus watched it go by (or 
rather, ignored it).
XDdds are that you did not see a 
CjMU basketball game this sea­
son . Crowds — no, that’s the 
wrong word — people at the 
games never amounted to more 
thfan 100 or 150. Once you sub­
tracted the families, roommates, 
and significant others, that left 
about 12 fans, plus the band.
Why don’t people come to our 
g^mes? After all, this is a campus 
that annually has more than 100 
intramural basketball teams. Yet 
it’s a major event if 200 people 
show up at a varsity ball game.
Some people claim that they’re 
too busy to go to the games. These 
are the same people who won’t 
miss LA. Law even if it means

failing a stats exam.
Others may ask why waste time 
watching Division III ball? And 
some may argue that they don’t 
want to waste a Saturday going 
off cam pus to see them. You would 
then be confusing the basketball 
teams with the football team.
Whatever your reasons, you 
weren’t at the games. Here’s what 
you missed.
The world’s smallest pep band 
comes to our games. CMU’s gym 
may be the only place you will 
ever hear the “Star Spangled 
Banner” performed by a tuba, 
trombone, flute, and drum. They 
do try, but it’s hard to really hear 
the “rocket’s red glare” when it’s 
done an octave below middle C.
The band is a victim of the
numbers. There’s an optimal ra­
tio of college fans to pep band 
members of about 15 to 1. They 
can’t afford a trumpet player until 
attendance hits 300.
You also get to see lots of cheer­
leaders — usually the other 
school’s. That’s the way it was 
when our women’s team played 
against Washington and Jeffer­
son and when our men played 
Bethany and so on.
And you get to see the world’s 
lamest half-time free throw shoot­
ing contest. If you make two out 
of four free throws you win two 
pizzas. Why is it so lame? Be­
cause the contest used to be two 
out of three and would stretch 
through the entire half-time 
period without anyone winning 
the pizzas.
Oh, yeah, you might get to see 
an exciting basketball game, too.

ACC, Big East battle in IM All-Stars action
SPORTSPEAK
by Josh Ruben
Computers: a 
fan’s last resort
I’m not sure exactly what a 
technocrat is. I believe it is a per­
son who believes strongly that 
the future of the world is depend­
ent upon the development and 
proliferation of technology—spe­
cifically in relation to computer 
science.
This idea of technocracy may 
have even been invented here at 
CMU, because, I’m told, CMU 
adheres so well to the techno­
cratic way of life, meaning that a 
majority of the population is 
dependent upon, or even exists 
for, computer technology.
While I like the convenience of 
computers, I do not think my life 
is dependent upon them. While 
my bank records and things like 
that are all on computer, I don’t 
think that I would crawl up and 
die if I had to use a typewriter for 
term papers.
But, computers do have one 
characteristic that makes them 
very pleasant to be around at 
times — they are immune to legal 
pressures.
Baseball fans have had to rely 
upon computers to fill the void 
left by the current major league 
lockout. You see, while some 
people may believe that comput­
ers do have personalities and are 
even temperamental at times, 
computers do not have to consult 
lawyers in order to work. They 
don’t have agents either.-
So, I guess out of necessity and 
boredom, I have become a techno­
crat. I am now dependant upon 
computers because of a phenome­
non known as computer baseball.
There are several programs on 
: the market now. All have certain 
characteristics which make them 
unique. Some do nothing more 
than play a game of baseball. You 
can bat, pitch, and steal bases 
against a computer controlled 
team.
But the more creative and fun 
games are those in which the 
members of the teams are pat­
terned after real-life players and 
¡utilize their real-life stats as data. 
‘Earl Weaver Baseball allows you 
to have Johnny Bench catch for 
Don Drysdale. Carl Yazstremski 
can follow Babe Ruth in a line-up. 
You can even play the game in 
Forbes Field or any of the late, 
great ballparks.
A new game, Micro-League 
¡Baseball, uses current players and 
¡teams. The main appeal with this 
game is to have simulated leagues 
;and see how good a manager/ 
iowner you are.
I play both games, as well as a 
myriad of others. I have to admit 
ithat being a manager is as tough 
as Herzog and Lasorda say. I mean 
.with Ty Cobb in scoring position, 
and Howard Johnson at the plate, 
;how would you pitch to him? 
Would you tell him to bunt?
One can learn a lot about the 
game of baseball by playing on 
computers. The only problem is 
watching little animated pixels 
darting around the screen is a 
sorry substitute for being able to 
see a real-life game. Sure, the 
stats are real, but there is more to 
baseball than box scores.
For now, technocracy has as- 
¡sumed a place in my life. I’ve been 
-omfortable with it thus far. I just 
hope this lockout is over soon. It’s 
a lot more fun watching a game 
while sitting on a big couch in 
front of a wide screen TV than 
huddling over a computer. But I 
guess that’s the price one pays for
1 commercials.

A new tradition in intramural 
basketball began this week with 
Saturday’s first annual IM Ma­
jors All-Star game.
The contest featured players 
from each of the 12 major-league 
teams, representing the Big East 
and the ACC, the two major divi­
sions.
Earl Birdy, director of Intra­
mural Athletics, coached the Big 
East team, while Birdy’s assis­
tant, Mike Mastroianni, coached 
the ACC stars. The game set a
tough standard for future con­
tests as the ACC held off the Big 
East for a 53-52 win.
“If we could have written a script 
for how we wanted the game to 
go, we couldn’t have done a better 
job than this,” said Mastroianni.
Early on in the contest, it looked 
as if the ACC was going to run 
away with the game as Up and 
In’s Tony Nelson and the L.A. All- 
Stars’ Dana Only lit up the score­
board.
Nelson would score 13 points in

Women thrash Bethany; snag 
PAC in triumphant end of season
By JASON McDONALD
Tartan Asst. Sports Editor
The women’s basketball team 
closed out its 1989-90 season 
with a 84r-67 victory against 
Bethany College on Thursday. 
The win gave the Tartans an 
overall record of 17-9, as well 
as a 7—1 mark in the Presi­
dents’ Athletic Conference.
“It was an appropriate end­
ing for this season,” said Head 
Coach Gerri Seidl. “Everyone, 
played really well, but I’m es-
pecially happy for the seniors.”
The Tartans dominated the 
game in the opening minutes, 
scoring 11 points before the Bi- 
sons hit their first basket. A few 
minutes later, however, Bethany 
got right back into the game with 
a pair of three-pointers by junior 
Lisa Wise. The teams then traded 
baskets until senior co-captain 
Lisa Smith hit a three-pointer to 
give the Tartans an eight-point 
lead, 22-14.
“I was a little surprised to see 
us start out so well,” said Seidl.
“We have a history of slow 
starts, so it was exciting to see 
us put so many points on the 
board.”
The Tartans proceeded to 
lengthen their lead down the 
stretch in the first half. Carne­
gie Mellon went on a 10—2 run, 
with six points by freshman 
Chandra Buist providing the 
offensive spark. The Bisons’ 
attempts at closing in on the 
Tartans proved to be fruitless, 
and the first half ended with

Ultimate Frisbee combines, endurance, intensity, and fun
By KATIE CULBERTSON
Tartan Sports Editor
It’s intense. It’s competitive. It’s fun.
It’s Ultimate Frisbee, the sport that has 
established frisbee as a prominent activity 
in the sportsworld.
Over the past twenty years, Ultimate 
Frisbee buffs have taken a leisurely back­
yard game and made it a competitive, world­
wide sport. CMU can claim a share in the 
Ultimate Frisbee craze with its team Mr. 
Yuk.
According to freshman Bert Robertson, 
the sport combines the skills required of 
any athlete, as well as some unique frisbee- 
passing methods and a shrewd strategy.
“It takes a whole lot of endurance, jump­
ing skills, speed, and running ability,” said 
Roberton. “There are five frisbee-throwing 
skills that you have to master before you
can really play.”
Robertson says Ulimate Frisbee is “just as 
intense as football or soccer,” although “it’s 
a lot looser when it comes to rules and 
officiating.”
The main objective in Ultimate Frisbee is 
to score by passing the frisbee among seven 
team members down to an end zone. Infrac­
tions include travelling while in possession 
of the frisbee. If a m ember of the other team 
can knock down or intercept the frisbee, 
then the intercepting team gains posses­
sion.
Mr. Yuk is now in the main stretch of its 
season, after a preliminary start-up season 
in the fall. CMU is a member of the Ultimate 
Players Association (UPA), a league consist­
ing mostly of Eastern schools, as well as a 
few from around the country. Roberston 
cited CMU, University of Pennsylvania,

Pens hang tough in Patrick race despite losing Lemieux
&2 MICHAEL D. C. DROUT
Ttirtan Staffwriter
! -Lemieux out for season, but 
Pens rebound. Mario Lemieux’s 
herniated disk, the injury that 
brought his record-challenging 
; scoring streak to an end, will cause 
,him to miss the last six weeks of 
¡the regular season. Doctors will 
operate to remove the disk, and 
hope to have the Penguins’ cap­
tain rehabilitated by the playoffs. 
Despite predictions that they
would crumble without their high- 
scoring center, the Pens moved 
into sole possession of first place 
with a win over the New York 
Islanders Wednesday. Both Troy 
Loney and John Cullen have been 
providing quality offense to make 
up for Lemieux’s absence.
Although rumors of a trade of 
defenseman Paul Coffey for Los 
Angeles’ Luc Robitaille are still 
active, the possibilities of such a 
trade seem to dwindle as the Pens 
continue to win.

Second Rival League? Gor­
don Stenback, of Thunder Bay, 
Ontario has announced that he 
will attempt to form another ex­
pansion league to compete with 
both the recently announced 
Global Hockey League (GHL). 
Stenback says he has commit­
ments from prospective owners 
in six cities.
Meanwhile, the GHL has come 
out with a list of cities for the pro­
posed European division. In­
cluded are Vienna, Düsseldorf, 
Helsinki, Milan, Rome, Bern, 
Stockholm, Paris, Lisbon, and Ge­
neva. The GHL intends to begin 
organization and draft plans in 
the very near future.
Quebec eliminated, plans for 
draft. Every team in the Adams 
division with the exception of the 
lowly Nordiques has not clinched 
a playoff berth. Even if the Nords 
won the rest of their games and 
fourth-place Hartford won theirs, 
Quebec would still not make the 
playoffs.
As of this writing, Quebec had

center, the Pens moved into sole pos­
session of first place with a win over 
the New York Islanders Wednesday.
still not won its tenth game and 
was on a pace to have one of the 
worst NHL seasons of all time. 
This insures that they will be able 
to draft top prospect Mike Ricci if 
they want to.
There has been speculation, 
however, that Quebec will not 
draft the highly touted center and 
will instead draft right wing Owen 
Nolan of the Cornwall Royals. 
Nolan is described as possessing 
the same blend of toughness and 
talent as New Jersey Devils first 
round (first overall) draft pick 
Brendan Shannahan.
More MVP talk. With Lemieux 
out for the season and Gretzky 
not having the impact on the 
Kings that he did last year, the 
MVP candidates have been nar­
rowed down to four or five new 
contenders for the Hart Trophy.
Since the general rule of thumb 
is to choose the best player from 
the best team, Boston’s Raymond 
Bourque has to be given great 
consideration. The Bruin’s scor­
ing defenseman is having one of 
his best years, on a pace to score
100 points.
Bourque has always been
known for his ability to play the 
body and provide defense as well 
as offense.
So has his top challenger for the 
Hart, Edmonton’s Marc Messier. 
Messier is the popular favorite 
for the award, combining inten­
sity, leadership, goal scoring abil­
ity and hard checking to make 
him the player many consider to 
be the most complete in the NHL.
Also competing for the Hart is 
league-leading goal scorer Brett 
Hull — on a pace to surpass his 
father’s old record of 77 goals in a 
season.
The Islander’s Pat Lafontaine 
and Detroit’s Steve Yzerman, both 
of whom are tied for second in 
goals scored, round out the top 
candidates.
In the end, it will be the team 
standings that will determine the 
winner, although hockey experts 
say that Boston’s record is slightly 
inflated, as they, and the rest of 
the Adams division, have the 
privilege of playing Quebec eight 
times during the season.
Safe, convenient Pill prevents pregnancy, other health risks
Oral contraceptives, better 
known as the Pill, have been ex­
tremely popular since their debut 
in 1960. Because it is the most 
effective reversible form of con­
traception and is considered safe 
and convenient, the Pill has many 
attractive qualities, (and a few 
; not-so-attractive qualities as well) 
that make it well-liked by college 
students.
; To begin taking the Pill, a 
iwoman must first get a prescrip­
tion from a doctor, who will only 
! do this after a pelvic exam. Al­
though there are other varieties 
of the Pill, most women will be 
given a combined pill—this means 
one which contains both synthetic
hormones estrogen and progestin- 
in either a standard or low-dose 
formula.
Combined oral contraceptives 
are thought to inhibit ovulation 
by blocking the production and 
release of FSH (follicle-stimulat­
ing hormone) and LH (luteinizing 
hormone). These hormones work 
together to cause ovulation, which 
is when the ovum leaves the fol­
licle in preparation for possible 
conception, and are suppressed 
by estrogen and progestin. In case 
ovulation would somehow occur 
anyway, the Pill also provides a 
physical barrier of cervical mu­
cus that blocks the uterus, and 
makes the lining of the endomet-

scribe them for patients on the 
basis of health alone. For women 1
suffering from menstrual pain, 
the Pill will usually minimize 
crampingandhelp to reduce pain­
ful menstruation. They also pro­
duce regular menstrual periods 
and may be used for control of 
bleedingpatterns. Pills generally 
reduce the number of days of 
menstrual flow and the total 
amount of blood loss during a 
period, so they are helpful in 
women who experience extremely 
heavy bleeding.
In addition, the Pill helps to re­
duce risks of ovarian cysts and 
cancer; they cut the risk of en­
dometrial cancer and pelvic in­
flammatory disease in half; ec­
topic pregnancies are rare in Pill
users; and they protect against 
rheumatoid arthritis and iron- 
deficiency anemia.
Other conditions, such as acne, 
premenstrual tension, anxiety, or 
depression, have been found to be 
less in some Pill users. However, 
in some women all of the above 
may be made somewhat worse by 
the use of oral contraceptives.
When a woman visits her doc­
tor to see about going on the Pill, 
she will be asked about her medi­
cal history. This is because there 
are a number of physical condi­
tions under which the Pill should 
not be taken. Blood clots, strokes, 
coronary artery disease, or a his­
tory of any of these are cause to
recommend that someone avoid 
taking the Pill.
Other deterrants include seri­
ous diseases ofthe liver; known or 
suspected malignancy of the 
breasts or reproductive system; 
known or suspected pregnancy; 
hypertension; severe and frequent 
migraine headaches; old age; 
smoking; cervical dysplasia; dia­
betes mellitus; or gallbladder 
disease.
There are also several side ef­
fects attributable to using the pilli-

End of season brings PAC title to women Tartans
continued from page 11
CMU ahead, 41—30.
In the early moments of the sec­
ond half, it seemed as if the sec­
ond half was going to be as easy as 
'the first, but the Tartans hit a 
brief cold streak offensively. 
Bethany’s Denise Doster capital­
ized with six straight points, cut­
ting the Tartan lead to six. A pair 
rif baskets by senior co-captain 
Donna Spicuzza, who led the Tar­
tans with 17 points, kept the lead 
¿olid until a three-pointer by 
Shanley Reeves and a basket by 
Lisa Wise made the score 53—50 
with 11 minutes left.
“We just had a streak where we 
couldn’t score, but I never really 
worried,” said Seidl. ”It always 
felt like the game was ours, even 
when the score was close.”
The Tartans called a timeout to 
regroup, and then proceeded to 
run away with the game. Smith, 
who had been leading the Tar­
tans with 11 points, fouled out 
with 9:20 left in the game, but the 
rest of the team picked up the 
'slack caused by Smith’s depar­
ture. Sophomore Katie Fahey, 
senior Tricia Chorgo, and 
Spicuzza combined for 24 points 
in a six-minute span, but the 
biggest score of the game may 
have been sophomore Heather 
O’Donnell’s foul shot off of an in­
tentional foul call on Bethany’s

Lori Bowersock.
“The intentional foul was a key,” 
said Seidl. “The official set the 
tone of the game with that call. It 
told them that they couldn’t foul 
us abusively and get away with 
it.”
CMU went on to eliminate any 
doubt about the outcome of the 
game by scoring eight unanswered 
points in less than two minutes. 
When Chorgo and Spicuzza 
checked out of the game with 1:21 
left, the Tartans held a comfort­
able 80-65 lead. Buist hit back- 
to-back baskets to become the fifth 
Tartan in double-digit scoring as 
CMU iced the 84-67 win.
Earlier in the week, the Tar­
tans survived a last-second scare 
from Washington and Jefferson 
to clinch sole possession of the 
PAC title for the second year in a 
row. Conference-leading scorer 
Kelly Stacey, who had 23 points 
on the day, saw her final shot 
land wide of the hoop to preserve
the 65-64 Tartan win.
The game was highlighted by 
one of the best Tartan perform­
ances of the year, turned in by 
Lisa Smith, who not only led all 
scorers with a season-high 24 
points, but pulled down ten re­
bounds and played solid defense 
throughout the game.
“She couldn’t have done any 
more than she did tonight,” com­
mented Seidl.
With the exception of an open­
ing scoring burst by the Tartans, 
the game was one of the most 
closely-fought of the season. There 
were 20 lead changes in the game, 
and after the 11-minute mark of 
the first half, neither team trailed 
by more than six for the rest of the 
game.
The Tartans got out to a 17-9 
lead in the first seven minutes of 
action, with Smith contributing
11 of the Tartans’ points. Stacey 
came back with three straight 
baskets, prompting a CMU time­

P8lmoi V8lu8i FimVmI croiso 4imqqa8n q8u088l u0o &8urIl2 48M8l48in Frein4I27
out with 10:18 on the clock. The 
final ten minutes of the half ex­
pired with neither team getting 
more than two points ahead ofthe 
other, and the teams went to the 
half tied at 32.
“I liked our composure on of­
fense,” saidSeidl. “I thoughtKelly 
[Sterling] did a really good job. 
She penetrated well, and made 
good choices when she had the 
ball.” Sterling finished the game
with 12 points, one of three Tar­
tans who scored in double digits.
The deadlock continued for the 
first 10 minutes of the second 
half, until W&J began to pull away 
behind a six-point run. Four 
minutes later, the Tartans 
notched six points of their own to 
even the score at 59 with 4:47 left. 
The teams matched scores until, 
with only 1:31 left on the clock, 
Fahey hit the basket that put
CMU ahead for good. The Presi­
dents had three chances to win ip 
the last minute, but turned the 
ball over on both tries prior to 
Stacey’s prayer shot.
“I really enjoyed working with 
this team,” said Seidl. “We had a 
tough schedule, but they rose to 
the occasion. If they hadn’t showed 
the poise and character they did; 
the season could have gone in a 
whole different direction.”

was 11 of 12 from the floor with 27 points and 
Bronner was right behind with 25. Carnegie Mel­
lon cruised to a 91-83 victory.
The matchup against Bethany was another 
matter. The Bisons played their typical game of 
bombing three-pointers from the outside. Led by 
their aces, Chris Geruschat and A1 Paisa, Bethany 
built a ten-point half-time lead.
However, Carnegie Mellon wasn’t done. Tough 
defense and Beckham’s, Chris Luckett’s, and Char­
lie Connors’s shooting helped the Tartans inch 
back into the game. They closed to within one with 
11 seconds remaining. However, Beckham was 
double-teamed from the inboundpass and was not 
able to get off a good shot. Bethany clung to a 
74-73 victory.
Unfortunately, there was one other game left in 
the season. The Seahawks of St. Mary’s College 
made the Tartans wish the season had ended with 
the Bethany loss.
The Seahawks came out running and built a 
15-0 lead before Carnegie Mellon could even get 
on the scoreboard. St. Mary’s Jason Slaughter hit 
four three-pointers in the first half as the Seahawks 
built a 20-point lead before the half even hit its 
midpoint.
The Tartans shot an ice-cold 29 percent and 
were only two of 20 from the three-point line as St. 
Mary’s cruised to a 79-52 win.
CMU closed the season at 4-21,1—13 in the Uni­
versity Athletic Association, and 2-6 in the PAC, 
its worst showing in over 15 years.
“We had a tough year,” said Anderson, with a bit
hi8nrSIl creVC colloin Il4 no,roSoi8 crimn Hoqqn u8IS e, IsImlnu Pu7 bIi2pn PIuei4I27
of understatement. “We started off on the road 
against tough teams. That set the tone for the sea­
son.”
The graduation of seniors Luckett, Beckham, and 
Keith Morgan will leave the team with Connors as 
the only player with significant experience in the 
front court.
However, Anderson feels that the experienced
back court plus Connors can form a nucleus to 
rebuild from. Bronner, Chris Dobbs, and Todd JèïP 
kins all started this season and have shown an 
ability to run the offense.
“I think we can be .500 next season. We’re défi- 
nitely going to have to work at it. We’ve got to first 
concentrate on winning the games at home. We 
have to get stronger, and rebound better.”

Tartan Staffwriter
The men’s and women’s track 
teams found the Slippery Rock 
Invitational track meet to be full 
of both surprises and disappoint­
ments Saturday as they took on 
Division II teams in standard 
events and several relay races.
In the field events, the men’s 
shotput brought home a fifth place 
finish in the combined throw. This 
included a throw of 41 feet, 6 
inches by freshman Jason Lange. 
A team fifth in the men’s long 
jump was aided by freshman 
Abdul-Rahkeem Foster, who 
jumped 21 feet, 7.5 inches.
Coach Gary Meckley was happy 
with Foster’s performance. “It was 
very good,” he said.
‘That will put him in the top 
three [long jumpers] of the Uni­
versity Athletic Association right 
now.”
Senior Sue Johnson said of the 
women’s two mile run, “Today 
was a disappointment but next 
week better be better.” Johnson is 
looking forward to running a 
faster race at the championships, 
to be held Saturday and Sunday 
at the University of Chicago.
Sophomore Mike Damon ran a 
time of 9:54.8 in the men’s two 
mile, a time which earned him 
first place in the event. He was 
followed by senior Tim Berger, 
who took third place with his time 
of 10:02.2.
The men’s four mile relay team 
consisted of senior Gary Meeker, 
sophomore Jonathon Freider, 
sophomore John Byrnes, and 
junior Todd Balbera. Although 
their sixth place finish was not as 
high as had been hoped. Mecklev
noted that some members were 
just coming off illnesses.
Of the women’s sprint medley 
relay, which included sophomore 
Lois Raska, seniors Charsetta 
Grant and Jody Burig, and fresh­
man Cindy Wei, Burig said, “I 
think we’re doing better because 
of our superior coaching from 
Dario [Donatelli] and Barry 
Robinson.”
The men’s sprint medley team 
took third place, losing second 
place by four-tenths of a second. 
It consisted of freshman Sean 
Pempel, freshman Chris Maguire, 
junior Will Wojciechowski, and 
junior Gary Harrison, who ran 
the 800 meters in 1:58.7. The total 
time of the team was 3:42.4.
Foster, who made his debut 
last week when he won the 55 
meter dash at the Robert Morris 
meet in 6.35 seconds, took first 
place in the 55 meters with a time 
of 6.5 seconds.
“I’m really excited to be win­
ning,” said Foster, a former state 
champion at the high school level.
The women’s distance medley, 
including senior Sandy Payne, 
Wei, Raska, and junior Kristin 
Burgard, took a fourth place fin­
ish.
Although Payne was disap­
pointed in her time in the medley, 
she felt pleased in the final event, 
the women’s four-by-200 meters. 
Payne, Burig, Grant, and junior 
Lilly Mansour ran a time of 2:05 
in the race.
The teams and coaches are look­
ing forward to a good showing at 
the championships next weekend.
“We looked good again,” said 
Balbera, “ and if we can get all our 
guys to Chicago, we’ll definitely 
make some noise at the UAA.”

bling up, or taking an extra set of 
pills during this time, can help 
Uns, as can a switchin to a differ­
ent variety ofPill with more estro­
gen.
Little or no menstruation is 
known to occur in women who are 
takingthePill. Otherpossibleside 
effects include; a urinary tract 
Wfection; vaginal discharge and 
JiimuIumol$ and chloasma, or in­
creased facial skin pigmentation 
Caused from the increased amount 
°f estrogen. Somewhat attribut­
able side effects of the Pill include
headaches, depression, breast 
tendemesB, and weight change. 
It is also under consideration that 
a change in sex drive can be found 
among Pill users, but the chance 
is slight that birth control pill use 
is the reason for these changes.
In healthy persons, Pill use has 
been found to be a safe and effec­
tive form of birth control. Because 
there are several varieties of the 
Pill, it is important that anyone 
who wants to begin taking it have 
an exam by a doctor.
In addtition to a general physi­
cal exam, it can include a check 
for any abnormalities and a Pap

MADNESS
has students 
running all over
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor
Midnight Madness seemed like 
the type of event college students 
should be doing. Running around 
ampus, Squirrel Hill, and 
Oakland in the wee hours of a 
snowy morning is the sort of ac­
tivity which should appeal to our 
generation: too stupid to know 
better and too excited not to no­
tice. ¦
The only treasure hunts I was 
familiar with had either been in 
movies like Million Dollar Mys­
tery or It’s a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad 
World or had been parts of com­
puter games I had struggled with 
ate at night. At least I was used 
to solving these problems at times 
should have been in bed!
Friday night I decided that I 
didn’t know better and wanted to 
see how mad I really was. Here’s 
vhat happened:
10:30 pm. Delta Tau Delta’s 
Steve Black, one of the organiz­
ers, is going crazy. He’s just dis­
covered that many of the teams 
receive clues sending them to 
Hunt. Library at Hunt Library. 
He has 90 minutes to sort out the 
clues and get them to the sites.
11:20 pm. The Weather Chan­
nel says that the temperature is 
30 degrees and on its way down. 
An additional sweatshirt and 
gloves are definitely in order.
11:43 pm. I’m in DTD’s base­
ment and am being introduced to 
my team, the Iguanas: sopho­
mores Mick Sutter, Rob Frazier, 
and Ken Brickner and freshman 
'hris Lehr. Their fifth member is 
nissing and I get drafted to re­
place him. As a reporter, I had ex­
pected to simply follow them
around, but now I get to partici­
pate. Sutter explains, “We don’t 
know what’s going on — I’m the 
map man, Rob’s the brain, and 
Ken’s the hired help.”
11:47 pm. Other teams are fil­
tering in. We’ve made our way 
over to the prize table and have 
already started to divide them. 
The Cher CD and Your Father’s 
Mustache hair care products are 
the major points of contention.
11:50 pm. Lehr has gone home 
and come back with a flashlight. 
We take our first look at the map, 
which stretches all the way from 
the Carnegie to Squirrel Hill and 
Shadyside. I start to take that 6 
am deadline a bit more seriously.
11:54 pm. The teams all seem to 
have arrived. The atmosphere is 
loose, Fishbone’s “Party at Ground 
Zero” is on the turntable, and a 
few people are dancing.
12:00 am. Okay, we’re running 
late. I can deal.
12:06 am. Coordinator Debz 
Kavaler, the freshman class presi­
dent of Chatham, steps onto the 
stage and announces, “Things are 
starting to happen.” Good, the 
natives are starting to get rest­
less.
12:09 am. Kavaler is still on 
stage going over the prizes. “First 
prize is stuff ... second place is 
more stuff.”
12:11 am. Frazier tries to crack 
ajoke. “Right now we are clueless,” 
he says. Everyone within hearing 
range groans.
12:14 am. The cluegivers leave.
12:16 am. Team #1 gets to go. 
Because everyone is following 
basically the same route, the 
starts have been staggered.
12:25 am. Finally! We get to go 
along with team #23: The Green

Aces.
12:29 am. Clue #1 was “The 
stroke of midnight.” We dash 
down the Cut towards the Clock. 
So does team #23. Seems most of 
them are on the track team—not 
a good sign. We might be able to 
outsmart them, but we can’t out­
run them.
12:30 am. The pack has started 
to thin. The next clue sent us to 
Forbes Gallery. Sutter has started 
to fall behind.
12:35 am. Up Forbes Avenue to 
the golf course. The clue said‘‘You 
must follow the hill, seeking the 
dimpled sphere.” Frazier and I 
are ahead of the other three.
12:39 am. We’re at the golf club­
house with a few other teams. 
There’s nobody with a clue there 
and about half a dozen teams are 
searching.
12:42 am. We decide to join up

with team #2 trying to find the 
cluegivers.
12:47 am. We finally found the 
next clue. The cluegivers were on 
the golf course, but they were not 
at the club house like they were 
supposed to be—they were some­
where near the 15th tee. Now 
we’re being followed. We contem­
plate going down Darlington to 
try to lose our posse.
12:49 am. On Forbes again, this 
time towards Squirrel Hill. Lehr 
starts tossing out movie quotes. 
He stumps me with “Can I have a 
cup of coffee—espresso please...” 
from The January Man. I get him 
back with quotes from Heathers.
12:51 am. We’re still being fol­
lowed. We break into a run to try 
to lose them.
12:56 am. Finally, we make it to 
the next clue. They don’t believe 
that we’re team #22 until we show 
our card.
12:57 am. Two clues later. “The 
Big Bird” is across the street. We 
grab the next clue and head up 
Bartlett. Someone yells to us from 
his car, “Hey! Where’s the party?” 
We don’t know — we’re on our 
way to Wendy’s.
1:03 am. Someone tells us 
“Cross-country (team #23) is 
flying.” They’re the only team 
ahead of us.
1:08 am. We pass another team 
on Forbes. They’re heading to­
wards Squirrel Hill and are way 
behind us in time.
1:10 am. We’re at the golf course 
aerain. trvineto fierure out whether
it’s faster to get to Panther Hol­
low along Forbes or through Sch- 
enley Park. Lehr wants to know 
which one of us has solved the 
most clues.
1:22 am. Panther Hollow. We’re 
running up and down Forbes hit­
ting all of the clue sites.
1:24 am. Sutter saves us. “Get 
tanked on Forbes....” means the 
Exxon station, not PHI.
1:31 am. The Carnegie. We’re 
still “just behind” the runners and 
we’re starting to get tired.
1:41 am. “Catholic in a mosaic 
way” gives us a little bit of a 
pause. We find it quickly, though, 
and are sent back to DTD. Could 
we be done already? We haven’t 
even gone into Shadyside yet!
1:45 am. We’re back, but so is 
team #23; they beat us by four 
minutes. We jump behind the bar 
to get some water. Sutter is a 
little disappointed, “Finding the 
clues was great—if only we could 
run.” Lehr is angrier: “Second 
place sucks,” is all he will say.
1:58 am. Black comes down-

A Person’s Opinion
On February 20, Rebecca Staf­
ford, President of Chatham Col­
lege announced a proposal that 
would make Chatham coeduca­
tional.
Following the announcement, 
students protested the proposal 
saying that they did not want 
men to enter their college.
Jane Beckwith, executive di­
rector of public affairs for 
Chatham, said that the pro­
posal had nothing to do with 
financial troubles.
The actual reason for this 
proposal, according toBeckwith, 
is demoagraphics.
Only 11 percent of women 
graduating from high school 
consider a women’s college and 
less than a third ofthat number 
actually do attend an-all female 
college.
So, we went out and asked 
members of the campus com­
munity what they thought about 
this neighboring college going 
coed.
Barry Timmons 
Freshman, CIT
“If Chatham goes coed, we have 
no girls. They got all the girls. It’s 
better that they stay all girls.”
Jay Bhutani 
GSIA
“I think there is a lot of special 
benefits to being an all-girls col­
lege and there’s a certain interac­
tion that takes place when there 
are both men and women there 
and I don’t think that’s always 
beneficial. There are alotofthings 
that women study [at a women’s 
college] that they wouldn’t study 
in a coed college.”
Ted Duffy 
Senior, CIT
“Yeah, I think that Chatham 
should go coed. I really think that 
colleges should be coeducational. 
I really don’t see any reason for a 
college to be all female or all male 
for that fact.”
Bruce Pollock
Freshman, CFA
“I don’t think [Chatham] should 
go coed. 1 think that it’s an option 
to those people who feel that single 
sex education is beneficial to give 
you a chance to help your own 
personality.”
GInol HmsSIlDFIiuiIl vrouosiI,r8i 
Terry Weinberger 
Sophomore, MCS
“I think that they should go 
coed just because they are los- 
ing many students. They’re not 
going to make it at all if they 
don’t.”
Madness strikes
continued from page LL
stairs. “It was a fucking night­
mare,” he says. “I was working 
on the clues the night before.” 
He informs me that we have 
just run six miles. No wonder 
my legs hurt.
2:15 am. The trophies aré 
handed out. The ATO Pósse 
came in third, we came in sec­
ond, and the Green Aces in first. 
The Green Aces were; John 
Supp, Dean Salvucci and three 
members of the track team who 
wish to remain anonymnous. 
Four minutes faster and each of 
us would have been 25 dollars 
richer. We curse tired legs and 
the people from the golf course 
who weren’t where they were 
supposed to be.
2:45 am. BackinBlack’s room. 
The course has been closed; most 
teams have given up or come in. 
It had taken him two hours to 
walk the course, knowing where 
to go. The winning team needed 
80 minutes. The Green Aces’ 
time would have been even 
fasterifthey hadn’t beaten some 
of the cluegivers to the clue 
locations. Some teams also 
missed a few locations because 
of the Hunt Library mixup.
As the night drags on, Delts 
and Chatham organizers float 
in and out of the conversation. 
“I’m surprised how it ran, I was 
expecting worse,” says Black. 
But, “It was worth it.”
Senior Jimmy Baker, another 
Delt organizer, joins us at about 
3:15 am and starts talking about 
his favorite moments from his 
vantage point at St. Paul’s Ca­
thedral. He’s angry because no 
one came back to get him when 
the hunt was over with and he 
had to walk home.
“I was with this team and I’m 
at Mellon Institute and they get 
their clue and they run across 
the street. I ask them where 
they’re going and they say, We 
can’t tell you. You’re with an­
other team.’ They get to St. 
Paul’s and I open my jacket 
[showing hisletters]. They were 
surprised.”
Kavaler comes in at around 
3:30 am. “It was terrific,” she 
beams.
She leaves and Black asks me 
about the clues. I tell him we 
didn’t have much trouble with 
them. He doesn’t seem too sur­
prised.
“The clues were designed to 
make people from both cam­
puses comfortable with them,” 
he says. But since many of the 
clues were on campus or in 
Oakland, the CMU teams had a 
definite advantage.
4:00 am. We’re all starting to 
tire. Black takes a sip of beer 
and says, “I’m so glad this is 
over.” Feeling my tired legs, I 
silently agree.
4:30 am. I stumble on home. 
Tired, disappointed in finish­
ing second, but happy I’d fin­
ished. I think back to some­
thing Lehr had said as we were 
running down Forbes. “I’m 
going to sleep like an iguana 
when this is done.” I didn’t 
understand him then, but as I 
hit my pillow, I began to figure 
it out.
The Trump divorce titillates the public
I would like for somebody to 
answer a simple question. Why is 
it that when Donald Trump gets a 
divorce, we are the ones who have 
to take the suffering? There is 
something definitely sick in a 
society where the sorrows of a 
single individual become the basis 
for a vast collective nightmare.
The way I see it, this has to be 
part of some insidious form of 
therapy available only to the 
exceedingly rich. Imagine, if you 
will, that instead of having to 
shoulder the emotional burden of 
gettingdivorced, the very rich and 
famous have all of their miseries 
heaped upon the rest of us poor 
slobs.
The press becomes saturated 
with reports. Every detail of the 
painful agony of divorce is heaped 
upon us by way of press releases, 
legal confrontations, Oprah, Phil 
Donahue, Geraldo Rivera, The 
Enquirer, CNN, and even The New 
York Times.
It gives me a faint sense of 
dread to think that having enough 
money entails an individual to 
have a large majority of people 
suffer his vicissitudes for him. 
Ultimately, Trump can devote all 
of his energies to the completion 
of his Taj Mahal resort in Atlantic 
City without sheddingatearwhile 
the rest of us rush to our respec­
tive analysts, confidantes, and un­
suspecting close friends with 
complaints about how profuse an 
annoyance the Trump divorce has 
become.
In the end, when all of the 
emotional energy expended is

tallied up by the powers that be, 
the level of frustration, anger, and 
unpleasantry caused by the 
Trump divorce would probably 
lead the person reading the gauges 
to think that Trump is probably 
the most sensitive, feeling, and 
injured human being alive.
By the way, does the fact that 
Donald Trump is building a Taj 
Mahal in Atlantic City mean that 
some Indian hotel magnate is 
building a Mount Rushmore in 
Bombay?
One can only dream that such 
symmetiy exists in the world; it 
would mean that, at some point, 
Donald Trump would have to 
make up in personal injury for all 
of the bad karma which has been 
wreaked upon us innocent mem­
bers of the public as a result of his 
divorce.
I think that if Trump were 
forced to have within him all of 
the negative vibes his divorce has 
spawned, even for the most fleet­
ing of moments, he would proba­
bly explode.
Of course, if Donald Trump 
were to spontaneously burst into 
a thousand pieces, there would be 
no accounting for the media blitz
that would ensue. The buying and 
selling of pieces of Trump alone 
would become the major new 
industry of that year. I can only 
speculate at how incredibly un­
bearable this event would make 
the sheer fact of existence in this 
society. Especially if the moment 
were caught on videotape:
“Good evening. Today, billion­
aire magnate Donald Trump blew 
into hundreds of thousands of 
pieces after being forced to inter­
nalize all of the negative energy 
he has generated.
“This unfortunate event was 
captured in full color by one of the 
security cameras in his newly 
completed Taj Mahal resort in 
Atlantic City.
“Although it is an exceedingly 
gruesome sight, featuring tons of 
blood offal and bile being hurdled 
at speeds faster than imaginable 
upon crowds of super-wealthy 
onlookers receivingfootmassages 
while playing hyper-high stakes 
games of chance in Trump’s ex­
clusive casino, we have decided 
that in order to best serve the 
public interest we will show the 
videotape every minute on the 
minute.”
The nightmare would then be 
complete. Even the death of 
Trump would become an oil slick 
on the collective unconscious. No 
matter where you’d turn, no 
matter how many times you’d 
press the channel change on your 
remote control, there it would be, 
that smug, self-satisfied grin 
explodinginto a million smug self- 
satisfied particles.
For some reason I am remihda 
of Back to the Future Part IJ 
chiefly the part where Mart 
MacFly returns to the present t 
discover that his evil nemesis Bif 
has become rich and powerful an 
controls the lives of all thos 
around him.
Could it be that we are in fai 
living out this nightmare, that w 
are merely the inhabitants of th 
proto-reality of some Mart 
MacFly who has returned to th 
present to find that that old higl 
school geek Donnie Trump, ha 
managed to effect world domini 
tion?
Maybe I am just being bitter,a 
dare I say it, envious? Yes, let’s bi 
honest, there is not one of us \vh 
wouldn’t want to have all 
Trump’s billions (or even somet 
Trump’s billions).
Still, I cannot help the'unbridlf 
onslaught of bile which rushi 
upon me whenever the man1 
name is mentioned.
However, like all smug com 
mentators on the human cond 
tion, we must try to put ourselvi 
above all of this. Ultimately ther 
is only one way to deal with th 
scourge of Donald Trump and 
of those like him. This solutis 
was put best by Samuel Goldwyi 
the old time movie magnate an 
notorious murderer of the Elf 
lish language, who once said “don 
even ignore him.”

is a fictional beer connoisseur 
travelling around the world re­
viewing beers from various coun­
tries.
We went back to Wyle E.’s Pub 
and had a few more brewskis. 
Then we had something to drink.
I asked Athena Suzanne Sorbet 
what she was referring to when 
shg said someone at Wyle E.’s 
could direct me towards the White 
Burger.
“Who were you referring to 
when you said someone at Wyle 
E.’s could direct me towards the 
White Burger?”
“Do you see that man over in 
the comer?”
“The one smashing beer bottles 
against his forehead?”
“Yeah. He knows where the 
White Burger is. Go ask him.”
I got up and walked across to 
the man’s table. Then I sat down.
He smashed another bottle 
against his forehead. “Want one?” 
He offered me a bottle. I refused.
“Do you know anything about 
the White Burger?”
“Who told you?”
“A.S.S.”
AROUND THE WORLD 
IN EIGHTY BEERS
by William Burky
“Whose ass?”
“Not whose ass, but ASS, 
Athena Suzanne Sorbet.”
“Oh.” He smashed another 
bottle against his forehead.
Isneezed.I think I caught some­
thing. Maybe I should put my 
mitt away.
“So, do you want another beer?” 
he asked before I could reply.
“Sure.” I replied.
“Hey, WyleE., throw down some 
Elephants,” he shouted.
“Elephants?” I queried as two 
beer bottles flew down towards 
us.
'Yeah, Elephant Malt Liquor. 
It makes me forget.”
I laughed as I took my first 
swig. The beer went up my nose. 
It smelled like beer until I sneezed.
I poured some of the beer into 
my handy Kiltie glass, given to 
me by the same guy who gave me 
my handy Activities Board bottle 
opener.
The beer was lighter than sev­
eral of the other beers that I have 
tried lately. All in all, it was a 
pretty average beer, even ifit was 
brewed by appointment to the 
Royal Danish Court. That would 
be a cool place to go, I could use a 
good blueberry danish right about 
now.
“The bottle looks kinda like a 
wine bottle.”
“Sure does.” and he smashed 
his bottle against my forehead.
After regaining consciousness I 
cut straight to the chase.
“So, where is the White Bur­
ger?”
“Tell you what. Meet me at my 
place in three hours.”
He left before I could sneeze 
again. I went back to ASS.
“So, didhe tell you whereto go?”
I remembered that I forgot to 
ask him his name. ASS told me 
his name. It was Bam-Bam. He 
got his name because he enjoyed 
smashing things. He lived over 
the river and through the woods
with his grandma.
At the appointed time, I went 
over the river and through the 
woods to Bam-Bam’shouse. Bam- 
Bam greeted me at the door and 
handed me another Elephant 
Malt Liquor.
“Maybe you’ll enjoy this one a 
little more. It’s cold.”
Cold beers are always better 
than warm beers. Unless its fro­
zen.
“So, tell me about the White 
Burger,” I asked as I opened the 
bottle.
“The White Burger is upstairs 
in my attic.”
“Are you kidding?” I said speech­
lessly.
“No. It’s been up there foryears. 
Someone left it there and right 
now, it’s just going to waste.”
I walked into his house. The 
hallway was littered with the 
broken refuse of many different 
pieces of furniture.
“Is it smashed to pieces like 
everything else in this house?” 
“How dare you,” he said “It 
would be sacrilegious to break it.” 
“That’s good to hear.” 
Suddenly, a dog burst through 
the door. It had something in its
mouth and it was vigorously 
shaking it. Bam-Bam took the 
obj ect from the dog and examined 
it.
“Damn.”
“What is it?”
“It’s a piece of a large potato.”
“The Spud!!” Before I could say 
anything else, The Spud burst 
through the frontdoor. FishHook, 
the sailor, came through the back 
door.
The Spud was carrying the six 
foot potato peeler and Fish Hook 
had a devastator, a variation of 
the Gatling gun but even deadlier 
because it shoots rubber bands 
instead of bullets.
Fish Hook laughed. “Now that 
we’ve found the White Burger, we 
can finally kill PA. Bill.”
He opened fire with the devas­
tator. I ducked and the rubber 
bands rippled through The Spud. 
He screamed as chips flew off him 
and around the room.
I grabbed a piece of wood and 
swungit at my enemies. Unfortu­
nately, Bam-Bam’s head got di­
rectly in the path of my swing and 
broke the two-by-four. Then the 
idiot passed out cold.
The dog started pulling out more
pieces of The Spud. I grabbed the 
potato peeler and whirled it in the 
general direction of Fish Hook. I 
hit him andhis body disintegrated 
into a thousand points of flesh. 
The dog stopped ripping apart 
The Spud. Everything was peace­
ful once again. The broken pieces 
of furniture were covered with 
one of my favorite meals — fish 
and chips.
Bam-Bam recovered after I 
splashed turpentine on his face. 
We went upstairs into the attic.
“There it is,” he said, pointing 
to a covered object in the corner of 
the attic.
I walked slowly over to the ob­
ject. I grabbed onto the tarp and 
yanked it off. It was the White 
Burger!!! I couldn’t believe my 
eyes. The White Burger was actu­
ally a ....

Patel soars to victory in plane contest
By ANDREW COSENTINO
Tartan Staffwriter
Looking back on the days of 
grade school, there were two dis­
tinct groups when it came to paper 
airplane construction. First, the 
elite group was comprised of those 
who, in an incredibly short 
amount of time, could transform 
a piece of notebook paper into a 
long-distance flying machine. The 
other, more populous club, con­
tained those who after at least 
ten minutes of hard labor, 
emerged with a contorted mess 
which upon takeoff, immediately 
drove itself into the ground.
- However, on Sunday, February 
18th, long past triumphs andfail- 
ures in paper aviation meant 
nothing, as members of both 
groups, now educated college 
students, had the opportunity to 
start with a clean slate in the first 
Annual CMU Paper Airplane 
Contest.
The contest, sponsored by SDC 
in coordination with Sigma 
Lambda Gamma (a pseudo Greek 
organization), took' place in the 
women’s gym, where through the 
course of the day, 100 paper air­
planes took flight and over 30 
dollars in prizes were awarded. 
The top three prizes (consisting of 
high quality model airplanes) 
were given to those contenders
whose planes flew the furthest 
distances along a straight line 
laid down in the gym. Consola­
tion prizes were awarded for such 
feats as airplane acrobatics (e.g. 
loop de loops) as well.
When the. final paper airplane 
landed, a good timé was had by 
all, but only a select few competi­
tors had the right stuff of which 
the greatest of classroom men­
aces are made.
In third place was Pat Barrow 
with a flight of 64' 7 1/2." Taking 
second was Chris Stengel with a 
loft of 64' 10 1/2." Finally, Sunny 
Patel, whose aircraft flew 72' 8 1/ 
2" (the entire length of the gym!) 
before experiencinga horrendous 
crash three feet above the base of 
the far wall, glided into first place 
and reserved a spot in the record 
books of recyclable aeronautic 
engineering.
Sunny said that he started 
making paper airplanes when he 
was a kid. He said, “My dad had 
workedfor Boeingfor twenty some 
odd years. Since he was into the 
aerospace industry, I got inter­
ested in what Dad was doing.” 
When asked how he felt when he 
saw his plane glide the distance 
he replied, “I was amazed that 
the little plane could go that far.”

JASON SPEAKS
by Jason Lee Smith
Calzone confesses | From the photo archives...
on his deathbed
armed robberieB. The two guys I 
was with would grab the victim’s 
money and valuables, andl’dtake 
whatever gum and breath mints 
he might have.
That was when I got my big 
break. Me and the guys held up 
this real fatcat. Tailor-made suit,
Rolex, the works. I had him pegged 
for five packs ofWrigley’s atleast.
I searched his pockets and 
grabbed just the gum. There were 
actually too many mints to cany, 
can you believe it? People sure 
knew how to live in those days.
Anyway, I’m running away with 
the gum, and who should I bump 
into, but Big Arnold Rococco, the 
head of the southside mob. Turns 
out he’d been watching me all the 
time. He said he liked my style, 
and offered me a job in his organi­
zation. It was a dream come true, 
let me tell you. I was in charge of 
all the gum for the entire south 
side. I even had an assistant to 
handle the breath mints.
Big Arnold took a liking to me 
and I rose quickly through the 
ranks. I moved up from gum to 
small change to petty cash, until, 
finally, I was Big Arnold’s right- 
hand man. We were pretty close 
in those days. I remember him 
saying to me “'Ey, you know you’re 
my bellum carolli. Mi supro passe 
di sitos.” I don’t speak Italian, but 
I can only assume that it was a 
compliment.
But Big, as we used to call him, 
was getting alonginyears, andhe 
started to get a little senile. Things 
went along all right until one day 
he decided that our boys were 
only going to hold up people who 
spoke Welsh. This being Chicago, 
and not some other berg like 
Glouchester or East Anglia, our 
profits dropped considerably.
The following is the deathbed 
confession of Eddie “Bloody Knife” 
Calzone, self-confessed hit-man, 
extortionist, confidence man, and 
public benefactor. Mr. Calzone 
died at age 69 of natural causes. 
He was shot in the chest 27 times. 
His last words were, “I'm feeling a 
little better.”
Yeah, sure, I was a gangster. 
Back in my old neighborhood, you 
had to be one to survive. You were 
either hunter or prey. The prey 
got their possessions stolen, were 
beat up, and were constantly ter­
rorized. The hunters, on the other 
hand, couldn’t trust anybody, and 
were continually persecuted by 
the police. But their starting sal­
ary was a little higher.
I joined my first gang when I 
was five. We used to beat up dogs 
and steal their collars. It was 
penny-ante stuff, true, but we 
were kids. You’ve got to work 
your way up through the ranks 
not many people know that. First 
you’re allowed to mug animals, 
then small children and old la­
dies, then middle-aged business­
men, and finally people holding 
elected office and high church 
officials. Some people say the 
system is unfair to the younger 
kids. I don’t know, that’s just the 
way it’s always been done.
By the time I had turned 18, 
they were letting me assist in

FIiuIl Mma8 ,rouo
There was talk about sending him 
into retirement, but before any­
thing could be done, he died. It 
was tragic, really.
Those last few day's he had 
become convinced that J. Edgar 
Hoover was following him, dis­
guised as an ostrich.
One day, he panicked and ran 
out into traffic. No cars hit him, 
but he fell down an open manhole 
and broke both his legs. He died of 
complications in the hospital a 
few days later.
Such a turnout for his funeral, 
you wouldn’t believe it. Every­
body was there: Jim “The Axe” 
O’Sullivan, Ralph “The Psycho” 
Williams, Guido “Death Fist” 
Morricone. What a great bunch of 
guys.
Of course, after Big Arnold
passed on, I naturally took over. I 
took Bob “Bob” Myers as my sec­
ond in command, but he never did 
have much imagination. I was 
able to centralize our power struc­
ture to make us more efficient.
We were able to take over the 
north, east, southwest, northeast, 
northwest, and southeast sides. 
Chicago didn’t have a west side 
back in those days, or we would 
have taken that over too.
Those were good days. I should 
have known they wouldn’t have 
lasted. I got the summons on 
August third.
The government wasn’t able to 
pin any of my racketeering on me, 
so they trumped up some charge 
about me not paying a traffic 
ticket. I got 93 years, but with 
good behavior I was out in two
months.
I will never forget my first day 
in jail. I was Eddie Calzone, the 
biggest murderer, extortionist, 
and terrorist Chicago had ever 
known, and now I was being 
treated like a common criminal. 
It was humiliating.
After my two months were up, 
I left jail alone and broken. Less 
than two hours after I was out, I 
got shot. It was Nunzio “Meat­
ball” Greenbloom who did it. He 
still held a grudge against me for 
that time I made him dance with 
the dust mop when we were kids. 
He managed to hit me 27 times, 
and punctured almost every one 
of my major organs. Thank God 
he’s got such lousy aim.
Now you know the whole stoiy. 
I’m not such a bad guy, really.
Sure I committed my fair share of 
bloodshed over the years, butwho 
hasn’t? I mean, after all, deep 
down, aren’t we all homicidal 
psychopaths at heart?
If I had life to live all over again, 
I don’t think I’d change a thing, 
except, of course, the going to jail 
and getting shot. My advice for 
any young criminal just starting 
out: Go into a different field. Crime 
may pay, but it’s really one heck 
of a life.
I’d advise novice criminals to go 
into other fields, like politics or 
medicine. Failing those, there’s 
always journalism.

How to slam into the 
Fence while playing rugby
I joined the rugby team. Now 
don’tgoreactingtheway all of my 
friends did. They were concerned 
that I had finally lost my wallet, 
that I wasn’t playing with a 
stacked deck, that there were owls 
in my belfry, that someone had 
stolen my marbles. In short, they 
figured that I was as nutty as a 
pheesecake.
; Well, they were wrong. I’ve been 
Off my rocldng chair for some time 
how and my decision to play rugby 
has nothing to do with my state of 
mind (I think it’s Pennsylvania). 
Rather, I found that something 
was missing from my life. I needed 
an outlet for pent up frustrations. 
'I turned to my roommate who is a 
rugger and said, “Chris, I want to 
kill!”
“Good, play rugby,” he replied.
Thus, I joined the team. Rugby 
has to be the only team sport 
where you can legally maim, hit, 
stomp, crush, smash, maul, and 
literally kill another human being. 
However, even that statement 
isn’t quite true. Ruggers aren’t 
really human beings. Once on the 
field, they mutate into another 
life form, one totally devoid of any 
qualms about drawing blood or 
breaking bones. The team slogan 
is, “Give blood, play rugby.”
So, there I was out on the prac­
tice field, going through my mu­
tations while leaminghow to pass, 
kick, snarl, growl, tackle, push, 
and scream in a bloodcurdling 
manner when someone said, “Let’s 
start the scrimmage now and let 
the new guys catch on as we play.” 
Oh great, I had no idea what I 
doing, and here I was, a prop in 
the middle of the scrum.
Let me explain for all of the lay 
people the idea of a scrum. The 
scrum is two packs of wild ani­
mals, one from each team, that, 
smooshes themselves together in 
the middle of the field. When the 
scrum has formed, the half-back 
rolls the ball underneath and the 
hookers fight with their feet to 
free the ball while everyone else 
pushes in opposite directions, 
tryingto kill the other team’s pack.
You must understand, I have
HIT AND MYTH
by Eric McAnallen
never seen a scrum, not even when 
I was playing, because my head 
was scrunched up against our 
hooker on one side and against 
the other team’s prop on the other 
side. Needless to say, I saw only 
the mud.
It was my job, as the prop, to 
support the hooker on one side. 
When I told my mother this, she 
was shocked that her son has to 
support a hooker. You know how 
it is. You can never explain ath­
letics or sexual practices to a 
mother.
Anyway, I was doing sprints 
back and forth when I was sud­
denly distracted by a flock of yel­
low and blue balloons that had 
landed on a nearby lamp post. In 
my amazement (one doesn’t get to 
see a flock of balloons everyday),
I ran right into the Fence.
There I was, lying underneath 
the Fence dazed and bewildered. 
As I rested there, looking up at 
the four hundred thousand bil­
lion layers of paint on the fence, 
my everactive sense of tradition 
said to me, “Eric, here is a long 
standingtradition on campus that 
could use some good press. So get 
up and go to it!”
Well, I never argue with my­
self. I’ll only win. So I decided to 
do some research into the origin 
and nocturnal activities of fence 
painters.
According to The Word, the 
Fence (originally the Senior 
Fence) was rebuilt by the class of 
1921, probably as the senior gift. 
Since that time student organiza­
tions, frats, individual students, 
campus administration, and stray 
animals have used the Fence as a 
billboard to announce everything
from armadillo party nights to 
zebra riding contests.
As you can imagine, in 69 years 
the layers of paint have gone 
beyond the comprehension of 
mortal man. In fact, pne report I 
read set the diameter of each fence 
post at approximately two inches. 
In comparison to today’s diame­
ter which is close to one and a half 
feet, there is only one thing to be 
said: “Whoa!”
Recently, the two sections of 
the Fence closest to Doherty col­
lapsed under the strain of time 
and paint. A controversy raged as 
to the fate of the Fence. Finally, it 
was decided that the two posts 
would be replaced with concrete 
and the crossbeams with new 
wooden planks. Of course, they 
were made in proportion to the 
current Fence rather than the 
original structure.
It was at this point that another 
dilemma arose—what to do with 
the original pieces. Many sug­
gested that theybe enshrined on 
campus, and others suggested 
that the pieces be cut into smaller 
pieces and sold to the community.
The fate of the pieces which was 
not publicly released shall now be 
revealed to all. The original wood 
was dissolved leaving behind 
impenetrable shells of latex. A 
couple of the shells were sent out 
to Three Mile Island for use as a 
toxic nuclear waste disposal con­
tainer, and a couple were sent to 
New Jersey for use as heavy duty 
garbage bags (the Hefty Cinch 
Sacs weren’t strong enough to hold 
the medical waste strewn about 
the beaches).
Another shell was sent to Rome, 
at the Pope’s request, for use as" 
long term' storage for precious 
religious relics such as the Shroud 
of Turin, the Holy Grail, and the 
Ark of the Covenant. In each case, 
it was figured that nothing in the 
world, except maybe Superman 
or a persistent salesmen, could 
get through that much latex.

ORCHESTRATING DESIGN SOLUTIONS
JAM SESSION
On-Campus Jam Session
March 12, 1990
In 1782, in the court of Emperor Joseph II, a brash 
young composer named Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 
set the music world on its ear. A radical departure 
from the current fashion in music, he set a new stan­
dard for style and composition.
It has always been so. The old guard surpassed by a 
new wave. It’s true today in the area of Integrated 
Circuit Design Automation (ICDA)—software tools 
used in the design and development of ICs and elec­
tronic systems. Cadence broke with the conventional 
order to create the industry’s only completely open 
and integrated ICDA software solution. Our high- 
performance tools are coordinated into one harmo­
nious environment, allowing the user to arrange 
the entire IC design process from design entry to 
final verification.
Our approach to integrating the IC design has made 
Cadence the leader in ICDA software. And now we’re 
building on our expertise in IC design and expanding 
our range to include a full line of products for the 
overall Electronic Design Automation (EDA) market, 
a much broader market than ICDA. We are a financially 
secure, fully resourced company, and we’re growing 
at 80% a year—over three times as fast as the indus­
try average. With the recent merger with Gateway 
Design Automation Corporation, now called our Ad­
vanced Computer-Aided Engineering (CAE) Division, 
we are able to challenge the top vendors in the systems 
design software market. And our new Advanced CAE 
Division will continue to market the Verilog logic 
simulation software products, bringing new strength 
to our market penetration efforts in Europe andjapan.

Paramount movies invade Pittsburgh’s screens
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Managing Editor
The gluttonous ’80s are over.
Greed is going out of style. Environ­
mentalism is the new credo. Rampant 
consumerism, the Red Menace, and good 
old-fashioned American sloth are on their 
way into the dustbin of history. The 
nineties promise to be healthier, less 
wealthy, kinder, gentler, and all-around 
boring.
Thank God for the movies. Paramount 
Pictures, coming off of ten years of in­
credible bounty for the film industry, is 
rewed up and ready to battle-the exis­
tential blues of a new decade. Read on for 
a rundown of some upcoming features.
After a lackluster start with less-than- 
successful films in January {Internal Af­
fairs, starring Andy Garcia and Richard 
Gere as ... wait for it... cops) and Febru­
ary (.Flashback, the bizarre bastard child 
of Freaky Friday, Easy Rider, and Hair,
starring Dennis Hopper and Kiefer Suth­
erland), Paramount has a blockbuster in 
the wings.
It’s based on one of the most successful 
novels of the ’80s, written by the author 
of four straight best-sellers. It’s directed 
by the hottest action-adventure impre­
sario — John (Die Hard, Predator) 
McTieman. It stars a man with the most 
bankable face in the business, fresh off 
an outing as the father of America’s 
prodigal whip-toting son — Sean {Indi­
ana Jones and the Last Crusade) Con­
nery -t— and a young actor with a string of 
screen-stealing performances — Alec 
{Beetlejuice, Married to the Mob, Talk 
Radio) Baldwin. It opens Friday. It’s The 
Hunt For Red October and it will, in all 
likelihood, knock your socks off.
For- those (few) unfamiliar with the 
Tom Clancy novel, The Hunt For Red 
October is the seminal work of a pop 
genre known as “technothriller” — high- 
tech military mischief mixed with high-
wire suspense. Clancy’s novel, which has 
sold zillions of copies worldwide, chron­
icles the defection of Soviet submarine 
captain Marko Ramius (played in the 
film by Connery) to the United States. A 
simple spy story — except Ramius is the 
captain of the Red October, the Soviets’ 
newest and sneakiest submarine, and 
when he defects he’s bringing his ship 
with him. Needless to say, this doesn’t 
sit well with the Kremlin, so the hunt is 
on.
Although the press release for Red 
October starts off with a lame-duck dis­
claimer, saying the film is “set in the 
time before glasnost and perestroika,” 
Clancy’s pre-1989 treatment of U.S.- 
Soviet relations doesn’t slow down the 
action one bit. Early previews of Red 
October have left viewers feeling as 
though they’ve been taken on a wild, 
wild ride.
Again, Red October opens this Friday. 
It’s gonna be good.
On March 30, Paramount’s next big 
thing will come along with Jack 
Nicholson’s latest project, The Two Jakes. 
Nicholson is directing and starring in 
this quasi-sequel to his Oscar-nominated 
film Chinatown.
Nicholson reprises the role of Jake 
Gittes, the detective he created in Chi­
natown, for this film. Although The Two 
Jakes is still set in Los Angeles, it’s 11 
years after the events of Chinatown and 
things have changed. “Jake and America 
have both been through the war,” says 
Nicholson. “It’s ‘Let’s Get America Mov­
ing Again’ time. [Jakel Gittes belongs to 
a golf club and has a fiancee.”
Nicholson and his collaborators tried 
to achieve a 1940s look in the film, and 
they paid attention to the production 
details. “Hard surfaces, sharp negatives,” 
Nicholson says. “What we’re doing is 
duplicating the ’40s Hollywood lighting 
style.”
While he’s worrying about the direc­
tion, Nicholson is supported by perform­
ances from Harvey {The Last Tempta­
tion of Christ) Keitel and Meg {Agnes of 
God) Tilly in The Two Jakes. Watch for it 
at the end of March.
Also coming this spring from Para­
mount:
Crazy People, starring Dudley Moore 
as a frazzled ad executive with a unique 
idea... truth in advertising. Nuts, right? 
His co-workers commit him to a sanitar­
ium, where he meets the woman of his 
dreams (Darryl Hannah). We’ll just have 
to wait and see about this one. Crazy 
People opens April 11.
Tales from the Darkside: The Movie, 
presenting some of the stories that just 
couldn’t be produced for the popular tele­
vision show. It stars Deborah Harry, 
James Remar, Rae Dawn Chong, Chris­
tian Slater, David Johansen, and fea­
tures stories by Stephen King, Michael 
McDowell, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. 
It opens April 27; look for it.
Personalities collide at the CMU/RAI concert
By PAUL CRITSER
Special to The Tartan
The concert on February 16 by 
the Carnegie Mellon Philhar­
monic for the Italian TV produce 
tion company RAI went well, but 
it was due more to the endurance 
level of the orchestra’s musicians 
than to the music direction of 
Maestro Delman or the capabili­
ties of the concert’s organizers.
I do not wish to leave the im­
pression that the maestro’s direc­
tion was bad. He is certainly an 
accomplished musician: a gradu- 
ate of the Leningrad Conserva­
tory; founder and music director 
of the Chamber Opera of Moscow; 
teacher at Moscow’s Institute of 
Theater Arts; conductor atTeatro 
Comunale in Bologna, Italy, 1980- 
83; and currently conductor of the 
^AI Orchestra in Milan. As is the 
case with all music directors, some
of the musicians will love them, 
and some will detest anything 
they do.
However, with 29 three-hour 
services in nineteen days (the 
Pittsburgh Symphony contracts 
approximately 24 per month), the 
CMU Philharmonic could have 
had someone as inspirational as 
Mozart leading them and still 
have been too exhausted to per­
form their best. The orchestra did 
well at the final concert, but luck 
was definitely a factor. Luckily, 
the musicians hadn’t all come 
down with cases of tendonitis and 
exhaustion.
However, difficult working 
conditions are a fact of life that 
working musicians have come to 
accept as the price of the quest of 
fame. In exposing CMU students 
to a rigorous rehearsal schedule
— most students will never en­
counter one more difficult in their
gin 8FeanwF8 SnNmwna FiNF Srun rw Nw 
omEin8FmN r8 Srun rw N arEFNFom8irR4 gin 
EowaeEFom r8 Fin meSnm4
lives — the concert’s organizers 
have done service to the students’ 
education. If the students can 
survive this type of treatment, 
they can survive anything the 
outside world has to offer.
If nothing else, the students 
learned that life in an orchestra is 
life in a dictatorship. The conduc­
tor is the ruler. In the fourth 
rehearsal with Delman, the prin­
cipal oboe was ordered to leave 
the room. By this point, everyone 
in the orchestra had gotten used 
to the maestro’s emotional out­
bursts and near-impossible de­
mands upon the musicians. But
when he asked the oboe player to 
change his reeds and the oboist 
said, “No, I won’t,” Delman be­
came so incensed that his demand 
be so flatly refused that he yelled, 
shook his fist, and told the oboist 
to leave.
Many of the students were 
scared stiff by this episode. So 
were a few of the hired free-lanc­
ers.
I have to pause here to say that 
many acquaintances have asked 
me, “Why should musicians get 
paid so much to do something 
which is so much fun to do?” I 
usually hesitate long enough to
decide whether or not to explain 
exactly how much “fun” we musi­
cians have in rehearsal. Leaving 
aside the hours and hours spent 
alone with one’s instrument trying 
to master its specific problems 
and quirks, and leaving aside the 
days and days spent alone with 
the instrument trying to learn all 
the notes written by a few hundred 
years worth of composers, re­
hearsals with other instrumen­
talists present an entirely differ­
ent set of problems for the musi­
cian to solve.
Sometimes I launch into a de­
scription of one of the wild and 
wonderful free-for-alls I have 
witnessed at rehearsals during 
my years as a musician, the ob­
jects thrown, oaths sworn, and 
people reduced to tears and helped 
from the room. Thinking that I 
have pacified a listener’s curios­
ity as to what can happen at a
rehearsal, often I am confronted 
with unbelieving stares and half 
smiles which suggest that, 
“Surely, you must be exaggerat­
ing.”
For that reason, I have to con­
sider the listener when asked 
about a musician’s life. Often I 
find myself changing the topic. It 
is difficult to convince the listen­
ing public that making music is 
not as easy and “fun” as it looks. 
Indeed, making it look easy is 
part of the art. And part of mak­
ing it look easy is subjugating all 
the animosity you have garnered 
during rehearsals while arguing 
intonation, tone quality, and in­
terpretation and making beauti­
ful music without glaring at fel­
low musicians duringthe perform­
ance.

L10The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 27 February 1990
Tempers simmer during RAI practice
continued from page L9
Delman came back to rehearsal 
the next day. He apologized to the 
orchestra for the incident the 
previous day; however, he reiter­
ated his decision not to change hi s 
reeds. A new oboist showed up for 
the following rehearsal.
Such is life in an orchestra. In a 
dictatorship, fair play is difficult 
to monitor and nearly impossible 
to control. To my knowledge, the 
CMU Philharmonic has not been 
subjected to such professional 
conditions in its history.
“If every note has a meaning, 
then no note will be uninterest­
ing,” Delman reverently told the 
orchestra. I suppose the conclu­
sion to be drawn from this state­
ment is that if every note is inter­
esting then the performance will 
be good. Fair enough. I agree. But 
a comment like this does little to 
help a student struggling to learn 
notes which have given profes­
sional musicians fits for ahundred 
years, namely the Third andFifth 
Symphonies by Tchaikovsky.
The maestro went on to spend 
hovus of rehearsal time explain­
ing the meaning he found in the 
notes. The opening of the second movement of the Fifth Symphony: 
“This is a woman. A woman all 
alone. Quiet. Praying. Nobody 
around. Just her. Alone. Hands 
folded. Kneeling. Praying. Quiet, 
quiet.... Alone ... and in her si­
lence ... saying everything....”
Or the end of the same second 
movement: “This is two people 
parting. One on a train. One on 
station platform. And the train 
slowly moving. Separating these 
two people who don’t know if they 
will ever see each other again. 
One leaving. One staying. 
Waving. Adio. Adio. Further and 
further away from each other. 
Adio. Adio. Waving. Further 
away. Still further. Still waving. 
They see the other waving but
Halfway through the rehearsal sched­
ule, Delman became strangely com­
placent. The number of stem de­
mands decreased, as did the impas­
sioned pleas for absolute seriousness. 
This all had a warming effect on the 
orchestra.
no w cannot hear them.... Still they 
continue ... Adio ... Adio..."
All done with a quivering voice, 
genuine tears coming to his eyes, 
it was extremely effective in cap­
turing the orchestra’s sympathies. 
It was touching. And for the un­
initiated or the bored it gave a 
real sense of meaning behind the 
notes.
But by the third time the or­
chestra heard this, minds started 
to wander. The woman in the 
church was praying that her 
neighbor’s cats would all gag on 
diseased mice. The person on the 
train finally took her seat to dis­
cover a tall, dark, and handsome 
stranger sitting next to her. And 
the one left on the station plat­
form turns towards home, thumbs 
open his little black book of phone 
numbers and sighs, “Let’s see 
now....”
The orchestra grew restless at 
further self-indulgent, meander­
ing descriptions of the music by 
the maestro. And at one point 
when he suggested the rumbling 
of the bass section to be “Hamlet’s 
father ... something under the 
ground,” some fertile mind at the 
back of the violin section mur­
mured, “Swamp Thing,” and was 
answered quickly from the wind 
section with, “Creature from the 
Black Lagoon.”
Let’s face it, an overdose of so­
lemnity is destined to affect any­
one with a sense of humor. And 
getting the giggles in an orches­
tra can be a serious problem. 
Anyone who has gotten them 
during a church service knows 
how disruptive and embarrass­
ing it can be. I have often won­
dered if the big shots in major 
orchestras cut back on the num­
ber of services they are required 
to perform per week simply to 
lessen the chance of getting the 
giggles on stage.
Halfway through the rehearsal 
schedule, Delman became 
strangely complacent. The num­
ber of stem demands decreased, 
as did the impassioned pleas for 
absolute seriousness. This all had 
a warming effect on the orches­
tra. A few of the senior members 
continued running their bitter, 
cynical commentaiy on the maes­
tro during the orchestra breaks. 
But even these attacks were 
slowly but surely ignored by most 
toward the end of the second week 
of rehearsals.
With only nine rehearsals left 
before the concert, Delman 
seemed to have accepted the or­
chestra as imperfect. The orches­
tra seemed to have done the same 
forthe conductor. Limitations rec­
ognized, the rehearsals became 
much more productive.
Delman stopped rehearsal only

once in this final week for a com­
mentary. And it was a very touch­
ing description of the second 
movement of the Third Sym­
phony. He described it first as a 
still life painting, and somehow 
in his talk wound it up comparing 
the piece to people who go through 
life without a care, always look­
ing straight ahead like a horse 
with blinders on, ignoring what 
happens around them. It was a 
talk which I will never forget even 
though I do not remember the 
exact words.
The final concert had touching 
moments as well. To see this 72 
year-old man standing amidst 
waves of beautiful sound coming 
from a group of musicians, many 
of whom were experiencing 
Tchaikovsky for the first time, 
many of whom were so carried
away with the moment that they 
could not help but commit the 
elementary mistakes of playing 
too loud and too fast and rushing 
entrances, Maestro Delman at 
times appeared almost not strong 
enough to reign in this wild bunch 
ofyoung musicians he had spurred 
into action that Friday afternoon.
But he was strong enough. The 
concert was a success. I give the 
musicians (excluding myself) an 
A not only for their performance 
but for their strength in the face 
of an overwhelming rehearsal 
schedule. (They were not even 
given the morning of the concert 
off to rest up for the perform­
ance!)
I give the maestro a B+. I give 
him a B for not having learned, 
with his years, how to get a better 
performance out of musicians. You
don’t make a marathon runner 
train right up to the moment of 
the race. However, I give him the 
plus for having made the point - 
over and over again in rehearsal 
thatmusicismade with the mind, 
not just the fingers.
And I give the organizers of the 
concert a C- for not having gotten, 
their money’s worth out of the 
event. With so many rehearsals, - 
they should have scheduled two ; 
or three concerts. This would have 
given the students a better expe-, 
rience as well since, after all, the ; 
point behind training musicians 
is to train them to perform.

Censorship hounds assault Beetle Bailey
JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
When I travel around the coun­
try being obnoxious, sometimes 
people come up to me and they 
, “Joe Bob, we used to just love 
your newspaper column till they 
¡topped putting it in the newspa­
per.”
And it’s true. I’ve been kicked 
out of some of the finest newspa­
pers in America. And so people 
always wanna know, “What is it 
10U get kicked out for, Joe Bob?” 
And usually the answer is ei- 
;her sex or religion. You can’t 
¡trite about sex or religion or else 
;he editor’s hiney puckers up and 
lis underwear rides up in his 
rack. But what are the two things 
leople wanna talk about? They 
lither wanna tell you what plas- 
ic love-rock they’re worshipping, 
jr else how they dressed up like a 
»iraffe in bed last night.
But then there’s other stuff you 
.an get kicked dut for, like an 
ithnic joke. But it depends on 
what ethnic group you’re joking 
about. Editors think alot of groups 
are funny—Iranians;the French, 
ilso known as the Froggies; Ja- 
iaheenos; Turks; Polish people,
except not in Chicago. And then 
some groups you’re supposed to 
never joke about or else they’ll 
kick your rear end from here to 
Nome, Alaska — blacks; gays, 
except in San Francisco, where 
the gays have a sense of humor; 
Indians, in some places. And so, 
of course, we all know what this 
means. If the editor thinks you 
can’t make jokes about blacks, 
gays or Indians, it’s because he 
thinks they’re scum. Otherwise 
he’d treat em like everybody else.
So anyhow, the point I’m mak­
ing is that now these Newspaper 
Nazis have taken the ultimate 
step: they censored-Beei/e Bailey\
Do you believe this?
Mort Walker, the guy who’s 
been writingSeefte Bailey for 297 
years, drew a comic strip where 
the general asks the troops to 
present their “guns” but he writes 
“buns” instead and so they all 
turn around and drop their pants. 
And so Mort’s syndicate refuses 
to send the comic strip out cause 
they think America would be in­
furiated by a bunch of droopy 
cartoon hineys. They said, “There 
are too many kids reading this 
feature.”
Have these people ever met a 
six-year-old? All you have to say 
to a six-year-old is the word 
“hiney,” or tell him about some­
one who had to show his hiney, 
and the kid can’t stop laughing 
for 15 minutes. To a six-year-old, 
seeing bare rear ends in Beetle 
Bailey would be the funniest joke 
since Sammy Davis kissed Archie 
Bunker onAll in the Family. We’re

talking Super Bowl of Kiddie 
Comedy here.
In other words, these turkeys 
are lying again, aren’t they?
Why do they really think the 
Beetle Bailey strip is disgusting?
Because they’ve been thinking 
too much about bare hineys.
That’s all I’m gonna say, cause
I don’t wanna get kickedout again.
But speaking of things impres­
sionable young children shouldn’t 
see, Morgan Fairchild is back at 
the drive-in! She’s pouty, she’s se- 
quined, she’s wearing too much 
makeup! Youknowwhatl’m talk­
ing about by now. It’s Phantom of 
the Mall, featuringthe big screen’s 
Numero Uno Lipstick Lizard as 
the evil mayor who’s killing people 
all over the lot so that someday 
she can be a profit partner in a 
shoppmg-mall development deal. 
(California screenwriter.)
Unfortunately for Morgan, 
another crazed killer, half-Freddy 
Krueger, half-high-school-jock-in- 
a-letter-jacket, is roaming 
through the mail’s air-condition­
ing vents, breathing heavily 
through a mask he carved off a 
Sears mannequin, and polishing 
the automatic cross-bow he lifted 
from Oshman’s Sporting Goods.
His name is Eric, and his face was 
horribly mutilated in a fire set by 
an arsonist that killed both his 
parents. It was during his senior 
year, too, and so he’s really 
bummed out.
Fortunately for us, Morgan 
Fairchild is one of those Califor­
nia mayors who spends every 
waking moment walking around 
the mall, so in the movie’s most 
exciting moment, the gruesome 
geek phantom gets to throw her 
wiggling, sequined, evening- 
dressed, high-heeled body 
through a glass window and then 
watch her fall three stories into 
the mall atrium, where she is 
impaled on an ice sculpture. There 
are some movies worth watching 
for just one scene.
Eight breasts. Eleven dead 
bodies. One motor vehicle chase, 
with three crashes, oneexplosion. 
Eye-popping electric-fan brain-

Cobra-in-the-commode attack. 
One guy gets escalatored to death.

Tartan Staffwriter
With spring break and the dis­
tant promise of mild weather 
pulling at our thoughts, work 
becomes increasingly tedious. 
When even a few skipped classes 
and blown-off assignments fail to 
snap you out of the rut, consider 
these options provided by the 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers. Situated 
in scenic Oakland, the 
Filmmakers is, according to its 
letterhead, “the media arts cen­
ter” offering a variety of media 
events and classes.
Henry V will be at the Fulton 
Mini until Thursday, March 8. It 
makes you wonder if Shake­
speare’s original generated as 
much discussion and excitement 
as this current cinematic inter­
pretation. The film marks the 
directing debut of Kenneth Bran­
agh and features what is being 
called the cream of Britain’s young 
actors. Henry V deals with young
Henry’s efforts to handle the 
troubled legacy of his father.
The biggest challenge the film 
has faced has been withstanding 
comparisons to Olivier’s well- 
known interpretation. Henry V is 
holding its own, having already 
been dubbed a masterpiece by 
critics. Recently, it accumulated 
Academy Award nominations for 
Best Actor (Branagh in the title 
role) and Best Director.
The Fulton Mini is located at
101 Sixth Street, downtown. 
Showtimes for Henry V are Mon­
day through Thursday 6 pm and 
8:30 pm; Friday 7 pm and 9:30 
pm; Saturday 2,4:30,7, and 9:30 
pm; and Sunday 2, 4:30, and 7 
pm. Admission is $4.50.
On Saturday the Gay Cable 
Network (GCN) will be at the 
Filmmakers’ Oakland Screening 
Room at 205 Oakland Avenue. 
GCN willhost a screening ofwork 
by Pam Lewis, Raymond Yeo,Tom 
Waters, and Shawn Quinlan, all 
video artists. Admission for the 8
pm screening is $4, with proceeds 
going to GCN. GCN is broadcast 
on Pittsburgh Community Tele­
vision on city cable channel 21. 
Programmingincludes GayNine- 
ties, a news and information show 
for the Gay and Lesbian commu­
nity.
Performance art, the recent 
target of significant media atten­
tion, comes to the Oakland Screen­
ing Room on Friday and Satur­
day, March 9 and 10. British art­
ist Richard Philpott will host a 
screening of his recent work, 
including Dead Pigeon. The show 
begins at 7:30 pm both nights, 
with a general admission charge 
of $3, and $2 for students and 
members of Filmmakers.
Yet another event in the popu­
lar Oakland Screening Room is 
the Black Maria Film and Video 
Festival on Saturday, March 17. 
The subjects of the screening are 
independent film and video works 
of U.S. artists, selected through 
juried competition. John Colum-
bus will host the evening which 
begins at 7:30 pm. Again general 
admission is $3, student and 
member admission is $2.
In addition to presenting film 
and video works, the Pittsburgh 
Filmmakers is also dedicated to 
photography. An exhibition of 
works by Dave Holt, a photogra­
pher from Los Angeles, will be on 
display until March 16. Holt’s 
photographs are large still lifes 
reminiscent of chalk drawings. 
The exhibition is open to the public 
and can be viewed at the Pitts­
burgh Filmmakers’ lalleryin the 
Oakland Avenue building.
Whether March attacks you 
with the ferocity of a provoked 
lion or caresses you with the soft­
ness of lamb’s wool, the Pitts­
burgh Filmmakers offers some 
suggestions for escaping monot­
ony. For information aboutHeno' 
V, call the Fulton at 471-9700.

The opening flight sequences of 
Revenge are reminiscent of those 
in the popular and exciting film 
Top Gun. This is no surprise, for 
Tony Scott directed both films. In 
Revenge, the scenery is beautiful, 
the actors are beautiful (with the 
exception of Anthony Quinn in a 
bikini), and the violence is beau­
tiful. In fact, the cinematography 
is so ridiculously attractive that 
it turns out to be the film’s biggest 
flaw.
Cochran (Kevin Costner) is a 
recently retired Navy pilot who 
travels to Mexico to visit his friend 
Tiburon (Anthony Quinn), an 
aging millionaire. Cochran and 
Tiburon play tennis and bond. 
Unfortunately, Cochran also 
bonds with Tiburon’s young and 
beautiful wife Miryea (Madeleine 
Stowe) and when Tiburon discov­
ers this, he wants revenge.
Cochran is beaten to a pulp and 
Miryea’s face is slashed in a scene

so unnecessarily violent that it 
will make your stomach turn. 
Cochran is left in a desert to die 
and Miryea is put in a whore­
house as punishment. Now it’s 
Cochran’s turn to seek some jus­
tice.
Scott takes the beautified vio­
lence and bloodshed in Revenge to 
extremes. While the director films 
these sequences slickly, this is
not enough to sustain a film that 
runs over two hours.
Costner gives a charismatic and 
likable performance as Cochran. 
The only problem with this is that 
when Costner tries to get tough, 
he loses his believability. It’s kind 
of like Mr. Rogers trying to show 
how macho he can be.
Quinn is well cast and convinc­
ing as Tiburon. One of the high-
his Zorba the Greek dance at a 
party. Still, when Tiburin gets 
vicious, it’s believable. Stowe 
delivers arefreshingperformance 
as Miryea. Her next film is the 
eagerly awaited The Two Jakes, 
in which she will be opposite Jack 
Nicholson.
Other fine performances are 
sprinkled throughout Revenge. 
James Gammon delights as a 
horse salesman looking for a good 
time while Trini Rodriguez pro­
vides a few laughs as the hundred-

King plagues America with The Dark Half
By STEPHEN GLICKER
, Tartan Diversions Editor
There’s a disease in this coun­
try, and it’s rapidly growing. It 
doesn’t discriminate, and it can 
strike anyone at anytime. It has 
already affected the lives of mil­
lions of healthy Americans, and it 
has just recently struck me. This 
disease has a name, and its name 
is Stephen King.
The first case of this terrible 
disease occurred way back in the 
early ’70s. It started with just a 
few short stories, and slowly it 
grew into King’s first novel, Car­
rie. No one thought much of it 
back then, but the fever was slowly 
taking a firm hold on America.
Slowly over the course of sev­
eral years this disease began to 
spread through novels like 
Salem’s Lot, The Shining, and 
The Stand. By the time The Dead 
Zone came out, America had 
reached the point of no return. 
The disease had become so severe 
it began to branch off into the 
movies.
After the films Carrie and The 
Shining were released, there was 
just no stopping it. Novels, mov­
ies, screenplays, collections, even 
pseudonyms were flying at the 
public in all directions. No matter 
how hard those afflicted tried,
. they just couldn’t avoid the dis­
ease. Stephen King disease had 
created a hunger that was never 
satisfied; you always needed more. 
And the disease’s namesake heard 
the cries of the people by writing 
nonstop, every day except for 
Christmas.
Within the last few months this 
disease has returned, and this 
time it has reached mammoth 
proportions. It has struck with 
the new King book entitled The 
Dark Half.
Even though this book has been 
out for barely six months, it has 
already sold over 1.5 million cop­
ies. Within the course of three 
months, it became the second 
bestselling book of the last dec­
ade, only to be beaten by the other 
disease, Tom Clancy (author of 
Clear and Present Danger and 
The Hunt for Red October), who is 
presently gripping the nation with 
an iron fist.
As in all Stephen King books, 
The Dark Half deals with a seem­
ingly normal situation and turns 
it into a supernatural nightmare 
of some sort. However, unlike 
most Stephen King books (such 
as It and Pet Sematary), this one

pulls no punches and cuts to the 
chase right away, never letting 
up for a moment.
The story revolves around a 
writer by the name of Thad 
Beaumont, who for a dozen years 
secretly publishes horror novels 
under the name of George Stark. 
Even though these violent books 
are national bestsellers, 
Beaumont can no longer take the 
strain of writing them and de­
cides to lay the pseudonym to 
rest.
From then on, things move 
along fine for Beaumont and his 
wife Liz. He is hard at work on a 
new book, the father of a pair of 
twins, and he hasn’t felt this 
healthy or happy in years. That 
is, until one day, as in all Stephen 
King books....
In the small town of Castle Rock, 
Maine — where almost every 
single Stephen King story in his­
tory has taken place — Sheriff 
Alan Pangborn stumbles onto the 
brutal roadside murder of a man 
named Homer Gamache.
Later, when Gamache’s blood- 
soaked pick-up truck is found with 
Beaumont’s fingerprints all over 
it, Pangborn decides to pay the 
Beaumonts a visit. Armed to the 
teeth with evidence, Pangborn 
tries to accuse Beaumont of the 
murder of Gamache.
However, things take a turn 
toward the supernatural when 
Beaumont provides a rock solid 
alibi for his whereabouts during 
the murder of Homer Gamache. 
Even though it seems impossible, 
Beaumont’s dark half, George 
Stark, is alive and on the loose, 
killing everyone and anything in 
his path that leads to the man 
who created him, Thad Beaumont.
As Stark approaches, Beaumont 
has to figure out how to get rid of 
him, before Stark can do the same.
So, there it is. The basic Stephen 
King plot... set up a normal situ­
ation, throw in a little bizarre 
supernatural evil, turn the main 
characters’ lives inside out, and 
have a shocking (but happy) end­
ing. The only question left unan­
swered is “does it work?” and I 
have to answer with “does it 
matter?”
Now don’t get me wrong, I like

this book a lot, but even some of 
Stephen King’s worst books get 
sold by the truckload. You see, 
once you are afflicted by Stephen 
King disease there is no turning 
back. You will read every single 
Stephen King book no matter 
what the general population says 
because, for lack of a better expla­
nation, you simply have to.
Back to that first question “does 
it work?” I have to answer yes. 
The Dark Half is one of Stephen 
King’s better novels. Since this 
book’s main character is a horror 
writer, King has no problem 
making him seem believable. As 
a matter of fact, all the characters 
in this book seem wonderfully 
alive and three-dimensional. King 
goes into such detail with just 
everyday items it is almost im­
possible not to believe that this 
story is really occurring.
Another plus, in my mind at 
least, is the amount of violence in 
this book. Most King books have 
their fair share, but this one goes 
overboard. Normally this might 
seem a little unnecessary, but 
considering the character King 
deals with in this book (Stark), it
fits his personality perfectly and 
makes the reader’s blood curdle. 
Stark is probably the finest, and 
most terrifying, character King 
has created to date.
My only problem with The Dark 
Half occurs at the very end. It 
seems far too predictable, and it 
left me drained and wanting more.
So, for all of those who have 
already been affected by Stephen 
King disease and have either read 
this book or are on their way to 
the store right now to buy it, The 
Dark Half makes a fine addition 
to your ever-growing Stephen 
King library.
As for all of those who are not 
yet affected by the disease but 
want to get started, I would sug­
gest that you wait for The Dark 
Half to come out in paperback; 
only die-hard fans should be forced 
to pay the $21.95 price. In the 
interim, I suggest you start out 
with one of King’s slightly less 
expensive, but just as good (if not 
better), paperback books, such as 
It, The Shining, or The Talisman.
Just be forewarned: Once you 
start reading Stephen King, you 
won’t be able to stop.

Warren Zevon becomes intimate at Syria Mosque
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
“Woof, woof!” goes Warren 
Zevon, punctuating his anti-music 
biz romp, “Even a Dog Can Shake 
Hands,” with Rover-on-crack 
theatrics for fans at his one-night- 
only Syria Mosque stint Sunday, 
February 18. Zevon has many 
assets: He’s an energetic per­
former, an accomplished song­
writer, and an impressive multi­
instrumentalist (guitar, piano, 
harmonica, etc.) His ability to woo 
a cult-like following of fans and 
critics alike can be broken down 
to two very alluring qualities — 
in his own tongue, “False mod­
esty and general weirdness.” 
Woof, woof.
He has a genuine knack for both. 
Zevon—with his straight, greasy 
hair pulled back into a ponytail, 
and his wire-rimmed glasses — 
has the unmistakable look of a 
degenerate history professor; he 
dropped too much acid in grad

Performed Sunday, February 18, at 
Syria Mosque.
school, so now he half amuses/ 
half scares his students with er­
ratic behavior and deranged his­
toric hallucinations. Like a re­
spected scholar, he documents his 
theses every so often and does a 
lecture tour, much to the delight 
of loyal students. On the Pitts­
burgh stop of his Dark Places in 
the Heart—Transverse City Tour, 
Zevon’s lesson was, as he told 
Rolling Stone last year, “I’m fine, 
it’s the rest of the world that’s 
fucked up.”
While Zevon’s wellbeing is still 
open for debate, the show Sunday 
night certainly made a strong case 
for the fucked up-ness of the eve­
rybody else. By the sixth song of
his charged set, the audience had 
already been exposed to gener­
ally weird Zevonean analyses of 
record industry ethics (“Even a 
Dog Can Shake Hands”), bizarre 
sexual mores (“Poor Poor Pitiful 
Me”), hypocrisy in professional 
boxing (“Boom Boom Mancini”), 
and, uh, decapitated Viet Nam 
vets (“Roland the Headless Th­
ompson Gunner”). Though 
Zevon’s views may not be univer­
sally accessible, no one can dis­
agree with the twangy kick of 
“Pitiful Me” and the deceivingly 
pretty harmonies of “Roland."
The Syria Mosque Ballroom’s 
folding chair-and-lunch table set­
up afforded Zevon the opportu­
nity for an intimate show — an 
opportunity that he seized with 
amusing results. After perform­
ing the melodious “Splendid Iso­
lation,” his latest single, Zevon 
demonstrated his ability to be 
generally weird on the spot by 
comparing the Ballroom’s “hell­
ish picnic” setup to a prison cafe-

teria, adding that a school princi­
pal wouldn’t look out of place 
reprimanding the crowd. When 
ace session drummer Ian Wallace 
suggested that playing “some of 
that classical shit” would please 
the citizens of America’s most 
livable city, Zevon obliged by 
toying around on his synth-pi- 
ano, hinting at and finally break­
ing into his classic “Werewolves 
of London.”
The set, comprised mostly of 
“bestof” BXiASentimentalHygiene 
(1987) material, was tight and 
enthusiastic. With a crack en­
semble behindhim, Zevon got the 
most from first-rate compositions 
like his self-deprecating stomper, 
“Detox Mansion,” and the poign­
ant encore piece, “Mohammed’s 
Radio.” The atmosphere on stage 
was playful, as the mock guitar 
duel during “Boom Boom 
Mancini” demonstrated; if there 
was a lag in inspiration, it was 
dining the conceptual, Transverse 
City part of the show.
Attempting to perform the con­
ceptual material from Transverse 
City in the sequence in which it 
appears on the album was ambi­
tious, but the result was disap­
pointing. Traditionally, concept 
albums have proven too mam­
moth in scope (or too contrived) to 
be successful in a live perform­
ance, and Zevon’s bit was no ex­
ception. Although “Transverse 
City,” “Run Straight Down,” and
“Long Arm of the Law” are solid 
pieces, alive show at the Mosque 
is not the right atmosphere for 
them; some audience members 
began calling for Zevon to do a 
cover of “What’s New Pussy Cat?”
Zevon satisfied almost every­
one with his triple encore of “Play 
It All Night Long,” “Lawyers, 
Guns and Money,” and 
“Mohammed’s Radio.” By saying 
“almost everyone,” a reference is 
being made to the disappointing 
omission of his psychocomic 
“Excitable Boy.” Regardless, 
Zevon certainly did a fine job 
pleasing his audience; for the final 
encore, the Mosque audience rose 
from the seated position it had 
maintained all concert, andjoined 
in for the last chorus of “Moham­
med.” With his combination of 
false modesty (in the form of self- 
critical gibes), and general weird­
ness (in the form of just about 
everything else), Zevon won the 
day in Pittsburgh.
Woof, woof, indeed.
Kresge Theatre debuts 3 postmodern classics by Beckett
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
About twenty years ago, a theatre critic 
for the London Times was having trouble 
with a nasty letter writer. Apparently 
the reviewer overstepped the bounds of 
journalistic propriety by contemplating 
(in print) a rather farfetched explana­
tion for the floundering of the drama 
scene in the U.K.
The letter took umbrage at the Times’ 
critic’s assertion that “Sir John Gielgud 
harmed the contemporary theatre by 
advising Sir Alec Guinness and Sir Ralph 
Richardson not to accept engagements 
in Waiting for Godot.” After calling the 
critic a liar, the writer of the letter (who 
was, incidentally, Gielgud’s brother, Val) 
went on to dismiss Waiting for Godot as
a “pretentious bore,” and wholly unwor­
thy of performers of Guinness’ and 
Richardson’s caliber.
This anecdote is presented as a means 
of illustrating the difficulty people had 
and still have in accepting Samuel 
Beckett’s dramatic vision. The difficulty 
arises from the vision itself — a comic 
nightmare of non-communication, hu­
man ineptitude, futility, and nothing­
ness. Making use of biblical and cultural 
allusions and puzzling symbolism, Beck­
ett created theatre that was contradic­
tory to its medium for its lack of “drama” 
in any traditional sense of the word. So, 
while some see Godot as a profoundly 
bleak reading of the human condition, 
others consider it merely an intellectual 
practical joke. On this point the Kresge 
Theatre’s upcoming Beckett Symposium
will no doubt separate the men from the 
boys.
Godot, Endgame, and Act Without 
Words —• the three plays that comprise 
the Beckett Symposium — will provide 
the audience with plenty of information 
on which to base their judgement. Godot, 
first performed in 1953, is considered 
Beckett’s best drama (or tragicomedy, as 
it is often billed), featuring classic Beck­
ett devices of nonsensical dialogue, tem­
poral confusion and violent vaudeville.
The play’s two acts present Estragon 
and Vladimir waiting on a desolate coun­
try road near a lone tree. Just what they 
are waiting for has been the subject of 
much speculation: God — as the play’s 
biblical references would suggest — 
death, enlightenment, redemption? 
Beckett himself said he did not know.
Endgame and Act Without Words, 
usually published together, supply an 
equally intriguing if slightly more diffi­
cult sampling of Beckett; Endgame is 
difficult for its relentless cynicism and 
Act for its abrupt, disturbing mime de­
picting aman’s unsuccessful attempts to 
get water, make an escape, and commit 
suicide. Endgame is the story of the 
sadisticinvalid, Hamm, his servant, Clov, 
and Nagg and Nell, Hamm’s trash-can- 
residing parents. During the one act, it is 
revealed that no life exists outside their 
large, grey shelter. Hamm’s cruelty to 
his parents and to Clov, who must wheel 
him around, provide the basis for yet 
another of Beckett’s oblique, disturb­
ingly comic insights into human nature.
The Beckett Symposium is a theatrical 
event that should not be missed. All
three plays form an existential drama- 
lover’s Holy Trinity. Those who are not 
so fond of (or familiar with) the work of 
Beckett and the Theatre of the Absurd 
are advised to sample Godot first, as it is 
most palatable of the plays. With all 
three plays as evidence, however, mem­
bers of the audience will be prepared to 
make their case for or against Beckett— 
bizarre genius or pretentious practical 
joker.
Waiting for Godot, presented by the 
CMU Drama Department, runs March
2, 6, and 8 at 8 pm, with 2 pm matinees 
on March 10,14,16, and 17. Endgame

Never Give A Sucker 
An Even Break
This 1941 comedy features W. C. Fields as the 
sucker who can’t get an even break. It’s Fields’ last 
starring role — he plays himself — and it’s zany, 
black and white, old-fashioned Hollywood laughs 
from scene to ridiculous scene. If you like the Marx 
Brothers, the Three Stooges, and other old comedy 
movies, Never Give a Sucker an Even Break is 
probably worth a dollar and an hour and a half of 
your Thursday night.
At 6, 8,10 — Not Rated
Friday, March 2
Clean And Sober
Clean and Sober features Michael Keaton’s break­
through dramatic role as a recovering alcoholic. 
Morgan Freeman (Glory, Street Smart, Driving 
Miss Daisy) and Kathy Baker also star.
Keaton is a smart-ass, small-time hustler who 
ducks out of sight by crawli ng under a rock? No, by 
committing himself to a drug rehab program. He 
won’t admit he’s got a problem; he just figures it’s a 
smart move. This is Michael Keaton at his pre- 
Batman finest. Come to think of it, it’s Keaton at his 
finest, period.
Not to suggest that, beneath the sweltering hype 
of summer 1989, Keaton achieved less than cine­
matic perfection in the role of the Caped Crusader. 
Batman was a fan movie, but Clean and Sober gives 
Keaton a role that he can really sink his teeth into. 
A character of such dimension and life and imper­
fection that only real talent—thekindofreal acting 
talent that Keaton shows in this movie — can do it 
justice. And Keaton does the role justice. His land­
mark first-dramatic-role performance created Os­
car talk in 1988. Not just realistic, but believable, 
his performance is, if nothing else, relentless. Great 
Friday night fare.

Black Rain
Two tough American cops, Michael Douglas and 
Nick Conklin, take on the Osaka yakuza (Japan’s 
version ofthe Mafia), and try to do it their way. They 
should have stayed home.
Moviegoers expect more from Ridley Scott (Alien, 
Blade Runner) than what they get in Black Rain. 
Even the cinematography—arguably, the best part 
of the film, and supposedly Scott’s forte—falls a bit 
flat. Weak on plot, pale in characterizations, and 
wasteful of talent, this movie is a disappointment. 
And Douglas puts in a performance that, well, let’s 
just say it isn't up to his Wall Street best. Save your 
dollar for Sunday.

Highlander
Carnegie Mellon has a few traditions that every 
student is just obligated not to miss: painting the 
Fence, eating O’s fries, traying, and seeing High­
lander.
Sixteenth-century Scottish Highlander Connor 
MacCleod (Christopher Lambert) and his mentor 
(Sean Connery) gallop through the centuries as 
immortal warriors cursed to fight to the last of their 
ilk ... until MacCleod reaches twentieth-century 
America, at last to meet his ultimate foe.
Lambert, as MacCleod, is a strong, silent swash­
buckler with a funny accent. The best of his acting 
comes in the scene where he outlives his Scottish 
wife. But don’t worry, you want to see this movie for 
the action. Connery is terrific, as usual. It’s just too 
bad he can’t be in the movie more. Connery’s best 
scene comes when he gets his knoggin lopped off by 
the bad guy.
Top-notch sci-fi, non-stop action, great good guys, 
great bad guy, swordfolding world record, and more 
mortal wounds than you can shake a lopped-off 
head at — don’t miss this one!

Charities win at
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
Greek Sing 1990, one of the biggest phi­
lanthropy events in the Greek Calendar, 
raised money Friday night for the Pitts­
burgh Guild for the Blind and the Carne­
gie Mellon chapter of the Big Brothers/ 
BigSisters Program. No exact figure was 
available at press time.
Sing is unique because all the houses 
work together for charity, rather than 
each house working individually.
Prior to the competition, members of 
the Carnegie Mellon chapter of Big Broth­
ers/Big Sisters along with their “little” 
brothers and sisters performed the song 
“Stand By Me.”
Every house, with the exception of Al­
pha Epsilon Pi, competed this year. AEPi 
performed by helping the service frater­
nity Alpha Phi Omega with ushering.
In the past, the money from ticket sales 
was the main source of income for the 
event. However, this year the co-chais 
decided to sell advertising space in the 
program to raise more money. In a fun­
draising competition prior to Sing, Kappa 
Sigma sold the most ads for the program, 
raising $1,300. This work, in addition to 
the enthusiastic crowd response to their 
show “A Beatles Medley” earned them the 
Chairmen’s Choice.
In order to maintain the true spirit and 
purpose of Greek Sing five of the houses 
performed their shows last night for pa­
tients at the Rehabilitation Institute.
According to organizer Ash Vasudeva of 
Delta Upsilon, taking Greek Sing “on the 
road” for ch ari ties is not a new idea. “We’ve 
been talking about doing it for years,” he 
said. “This year I decided to finally make 
sure we did it.”
Initially, Vasudeva planned on perform­
ing for Children’s Hospital in Oakland. 
But, because they did not have facilities 
large enough to accommodate even some 
of the shows, an alternate location had to 
be found. The Rehabilitation Institute has 
a small gym where the show v/as held.
Vasudeva said that all the houses liked 
the idea. “I asked at a general Greek Sing 
meetingif anyone wanted todo this and all 
of the houses said yes.”

Kappa tops sororities in Greek Sing
By JOSH RUBEN
Tartan Contributing Editor
According to representatives from all five houses, the so­
rority competition in this year’s Greek Sing was the best 
ever.
Kappa Kappa Gamma’s dramatic presentation of Evita 
took top honors while Delta Delta Delta won first runner-up 
with Kappa Alpha Theta and Delta Gamma tying for second 
runner-up. Kappa Kappa Gamma Choreography Chair, 
Annalisa Ekbladh said, “We were suprized we won— all the 
sororities were so much better this year than in years past.”
Chi Omega took the stage first with a light and colorful
production of You’re a Good Man Charlie Brown. When 
asked if they were nervous or worried about being the first 
group to perform, the sisters answered in unison, “We’re 
really happy to be going first so that we can sit back and 
watch the rest of the show!”
Once the theme “Linus and Lucy” started and the ChiO 
sisters made their entrance doing the Pony, they instantly 
won the hearts of the audience. Unfortunately, the well- 
structured harmonies and colorful, yet simple, costumes did 
not dazzle the judges, leaving ChiO the only sorority not to 
place in the final tally.
Chair Joey Monaco said afterward, “We were really pleased

Eleven houses took the stage 
Friday night to compete in the 
fraternity division of Carnegie 
Me'llon’s annual Greek Sing. 
While a panel of judges evaluated 
the entries, some clearly took the 
competition more seriously than 
others. Still, no matter how much 
time, money, and effort a frater­
nity put into their act, the first 
priority seemed to be to go out 
and have some fun.
Delta Upsilon took first place 
with its excerpt from the show 
Shenandoah! Dressed like offi­
cers of the Blue and Grey, DU 
brothers kept a high energy level 
from the moment the music 
started. The choreography in this 
number utilized some standard 
movements, daring gymnastics, 
and a little bit of slapstick. Broth­
ers would pair off into couples 
with one man in blue and one in 
grey. They would then throw mock 
punches or kick at each other. 
Near the end of the number, two 
brothers were tossed backward 
and both did aeriel somersaults, 
landing lightly on the stage as the 
crowd went wild.
Before going onstage, DU broth­
ers expressed confidence and 
eager anticipation regarding their 
act. Hans Moritz described re­
hearsals as “Long and hard and 
worthwhile. Very worthwhile.”

Miguel Triay stated that he 
believed DU’s chances were “One 
hundred percent of having a good 
time. Winning—we have a really 
solid chance because we have a; 
show that’s really crowd-pleas­
ing.”
Sigma Alpha Epsilon also gave 
a lively, excitingperformance that 
went on to grab the second place 
position. This house made use of 
some complicated sets for its 
rendition of The Mystery of Ed­
win Drood. The choreography was 
energetic and perfectly synchro­
nized. The brothers were decked 
out in colorful vests and top hats 
to fit the period of the piece.

DTD’s Hair stands out in Greek Sing’s mixed competition
By STEPHEN GLICKER
'fartan Diversions Editor
“It’s a lot of work and you moan 
and groan about it for weeks, but 
'when you finally do it, it’s such a 
rush,” said junior Liz Bailey, a 
Delta Tau Delta little sister.
'' In another corner ofthe room is 
sophomore Mike Daninhirsch who 
4s-_fresh off the stage after per­
forming segments from the Sigma 
Tau Gamma’s musical, Grease, 
.and is now waiting for a cold re­
freshment. Like Bailey, Danin­
hirsch is also covered with sweat 
'and overcome by the evening’s ex- 
H'tement.
- “I’ve never seen anything like 
this at other schools,” Daninhirsch 
said. “There’s nothing like it.”
Such was the scene Friday night 
Jvhen five sororities and thirteen 
fraternities competed in the once 
£,year event of Greek Sing. Of the

three categories — fraternities, 
sorority, and mixed, (where the 
brothers and little sisters can 
perform together) •— DTD and 
Sig Tau were the only two who 
competed in the mixed division
this year. As a result, there was 
only one trophy given out this 
year in the mixed division, won by 
DTD’s Hair.
When DTD took the stage, for a 
brief moment the Syria Mosque
was transported back to a time 
when America was at war with 
itself — when love and war were 
intermixed into one. DTD little 
sister, sophomore Jen Kerstein 
started the company off with the 
song“Aquarius,” while thebroth- 
ers and little sisters portrayed 
hippies.
Next came the song “Hair,” 
where DTD continued to show off 
its stuff, dancing up a storm and 
filling the hall with music with 
senior Rudy Berk taking the lead. 
“Flesh Fantasy (Ain’t Got No)” 
was the next song where DTD 
showed the struggle between the 
different views of army and the 
hippies at the time. With a blur of 
color, motion, and sound, the 
brothers concluded their show 
with the song “Let the Sunshine 
In.” Their performance was truly 
a feast for the senses.
Also in the mixed division was
SigTau, who came in second with 
its performance of Grease. Once 
again theMosque was transported 
back in time, but this time the 
trip was longer and to a less tur­
bulent time.
Lockers filled the background 
while a large, red car took center 
stage. T-Birdgangmembers were 
on the left while Pink Ladies took 
the right side. Sophomore Darren 
Kastin and freshman Kim 
Loughran lead Sig Tau in a cho­
rus of“Summer Lovin’.” Next, the 
brothers were in full force with 
the song “Greased Lightning,” 
while they pretended to cruise 
around in their car. They finished 
their show up with a quick change 
in sets resulting in a trip to the 
amusement park and a full force 
production of “The One That I 
Want.”
Both performances were well 
rehearsed, performed, and sung.
However, only one ofthe fraterni­
ties could win and that fraternity 
was DTD.
When asked why DTD and Sig 
Tau competed in the mixed divi­
sion as opposed to just the frater: 
nity division, Bailey said, “We put 
on a different kind of show than 
the other groups. Andit’s so much 
fun working with the guys. It 
brings a lot of people inside thé 
house closer together.”
“It’s all of us, not just the guys,? 
DTD little sister, junior Kather­
ine LoMonico commented. “It's 
important to include everyone in 
the house.”
“The sorority [division] is much 
more competitivethan the mixed,! 
said SigTau little sister Zan Lam 
ber.
“It’s so much fun you forget it’s 
for charity,” said Lambert.
“I love Greek Sing,
Kastin. “It’s awesome.”

Greek Sing gives fraternities their moment in the spotlight

seemed to be falling apart. The 
top half of the scenery began to 
fall and the entire audience 
gasped until the set unfolded 
completely to reveal another pic­
ture showing a city in the eve­
ning. The audience applauded, 
relieved and amazed.
SAE brother John Powers, a 
drajna student, described the 
Greek Sing experience as “a re­
ally fun time. It really brings the 
house together."
Coming in third, Theta Xi gave 
a performance that seemed to 
come to the Syria Mosque directly 
from Broadway. In their West Side 
Story numbers, the brothers 
played up the violent rivalry be­
tween the Jets and the Sharks.
Not only were the singing, danc­
ing, and acting polished and pro­
fessional but Theta Xi’s Riff bore 
a striking resemblance to the star 
who originally filled that role.
Theta Xi’s performance opened 
with one of the Jets spray paint­
ing onto a backdrop filled with 
grafitti. The Sharks found him 
and chased him until he managed 
to find his gang and send the 
Sharks back to their territory. 
The Jets sang their theme song, 
followed by a song about an up­
coming rumble sung by both 
gangs. The brothers finished it off 
with a hilarious rendition of the 
song “Gee, Officer Krupke.”
The men of Phi Kappa Theta 
dished out some patrioticfare with 
songs from George M. Their cos­
tumes included suspenders, red 
bow ties, and white hats with 
blue and white stripes. Five broth­
ers, distinguishable by their gold 
bow ties and red suspenders, led 
the group with some first rate tap 
dancing.
B efore the show Rob Fi sher com­
mented on his fraternity’s act. 
“We tend to put a lot of hard work 
into it, but it’s definitely well 
worth it. The important thing isn’t 
the trophy. We’re out here to help 
people who need it.”
Kappa Sigma had one of the 
most creative offerings of the 
evening. Its Beatles Medley incor­
porated so many characters and 
actions that there was no way to 
watch everything that happened 
onstage.
One brother sang a few songs 
while trying to woo a woman in 
white (played by a brother in 
drag), avoid a woman in red (an­
other brother in drag), and melo­
dramatically escape Maxwell’s sil­
ver hammer. All the while, agiant 
replica ofthepinkrabbitfrom the 
Energizer commercials would 
pass by holding his big, white 
drum.
As the performance drew to a 
close, four men wearing brown 
yam wigs imitated the Fab Four 
as a yellow submarine and a cap­
tain came onstage.
Some brothers crawled down­
stage with cards containing the 
words to the refrain and one par­
ticularly energetic brother in red 
pajamas held a big red circle and 
tried to hold the circle above the 
words coming from the chorus.
Another playful performance 
came from Pi Kappa Alpha. These 
brothers belted out the School- 
house Rock ditty “Interjection.” 
Along with the the singing, the 
fraternity played out several 
narratives in which interjections 
might be required.
Each time a brother would 
scream out one of these magic 
words, someone would hoist up 
the proper interjection sign, con­
taining words like “Hey!” and 
“Rats!"
Kappa Delta Rho put on its togas 
and gladiator outfits for the 
musical A Funny Thing Hap­
pened On The Way To The Forum. 
They finished offGreek Sing with 
some comedic songs and enter­
taining dancing.
Although rehearsals took a lot
of hard work, brother Peter Low 
said that he likes to “go out and 
have fun and not think aboui the 
competition. It’s fun hearing the 
people all screaming and yelling 
and having a good time,” he said.
Other fraternities went onstage 
not to compete but just to be a 
part of the show. Pi Lambda Phi 
gave the audience its thoughts 
about love in PiLam’s Christmas 
in March.
The brothers in this act chose to 
take an abstract approach by not 
wearing any costumes and using 
backdrops that simply read “set” 
across them.
AlphaTheta Omega sangabout 
“ATO House” while Beta Theta Pi 
confessed “We can’t sing a thing, 
but we party.” Sigma Nu did Zoo 
Tunes with their band rocking 
onstage.
Sigma Nu brother Rudy Zung 
explained what he liked most 
about participating in the pro­
gram. “It lets non-dramat people 
go out onto the stage and enjoy a 
little bit of life under the lights.”

Volumle84 MioS ,Is8 fmChair Joey Monaco said after­
ward, “We were really pleased 
with what we did.” She added 
that she and many of the sisters 
were surprised that they did not 
place considering the crowd re­
sponse and the energy of their 
show.
The next sorority to compete 
was KappaAlphaTheta, perform­
ing thé classy Broadway hit My 
One and Only. Chair Gretchen 
Biesecker explained, “We thought 
it was a strongshow and we could 
do a lot with the vocal [opportu­
nity].”
Acommon trap with Greek Sing 
is a lack of clear diction. With up 
to60peopleon stage, hearing the 
lyrics of certain songs is a prob­
lem. Surprisingly, the Thetas did 
not fall into this trap. The staging 
and choreography took aback seat 
to strong, clear singing.
KappaKappa Gamma, the third 
sorority to compete, provided a 
stark contras. The sororities act 
followed two light, relaxed shows 
with their dramatic, heavier pro­
duction of Evita.
According to Ekbladh, this was 
a conscious decision. “We wanted
to get away from the sappy, girl­
ish shows. We wanted to compete 
more with the fraternities.”
The beautiful costumes and 
imaginative scenery impressed 
the judges and crowd alike. The 
huge cast did not seem too cum­
bersome and the entire produc­
tion flowed well.
The stark image of the peas­
ants of Argentina mourning the 
death of Eva Peron sent a shock 
wave throughout the audience. 
Instead of an immediate burst of 
applause, there was a momen­
tary hush as the crowd pondered 
the power of that image.
Unfortunately, neither of the 
musical’s two great songs “Don’t 
Cry For Me Argentina” or “I’d Be 
Good For You” were sung. Lauren 
Boice as Evita truly looked the 
part, but time requirements forced 
the Kappas to deal only with the 
choral numbers.
Duringtheintermission, Greek 
SingCo-ChairMarya Spring, said 
that she was pleased everything 
was going so well. Backstage 
during the intermission is nor­
mally a madhouse, but everything 
seemed calm as groups loaded

ments.
Delta Delta Delta had a tough 
act to follow when it came out to 
perform. Oliver. But its entire 
production was unique in that 
they did not focus upon intricate 
structuring of the vocal arrange­
ments.
The sisters played the parts of 
young English hooligans to per­
fection by simply singing strong 
with clear Cockney dialects. No 
elaborate sound system was 
needed for this show. AB Tech 
couldhave gone outfor coffee and 
doughnuts.
From the authentic looking 
costumes, to the imaginative stag­
ing of a carriage ride, the Tri- 
Delts did everything right. “We 
focused on every aspect of the 
show, not any one in particular,” 
said Chair Stacy Rinestine. “I 
knew how I wanted the show to 
look and oversaw everything.”She 
added that this year’s show was 
very easy to put together because 
jobs were divided up and nobody 
did everything.
The final sorority show was 
Delta Gamma’s production of 
Company.
Their costumes looked a lot like 
Chi-O’s and even Theta’s—bright 
colorful t-shirts and pants. Voice 
Chair. Lydecke Sweet explained 
the choices made for this year’s 
show, “The show Company repre­
sented our sorority — a group of 
people who love and care about 
one another.” Chair Jeanne Rein1 
hard added, “The colorful cos­
tumes and set represen ted happir 
ness.”
Well executed choreography 
and nice harmonies made this 
show. The DGs showed true show­
manship when there was a mo­
mentary blackout on stage right 
in the middle of a song and they 
did not miss a beat.
Unfortunately, D G’s production 
of Company did not include the 
musical’s big song, “Being Alive.” 
DG demonstrated a fine vocal 
capacity and could have done a lot 
with one of Stephen Sondheim’s 
most famous songs.
Overall, almost everyone be­
lieved that the sorority shows 
were stronger than the fraternity 
shows. Sweet said, “Everyone’s 
show [in the sorority competition] 
was upgraded from last year.”

A Salvadoran talks about unwanted US intervention in El Salvador
By DEXTER T. KOBAYASHI
Tartan Asst. Features Editor
Jaime Suriano visited Carne­
gie Mellon last Thursday as part 
of an ongoing regional tour to 
educate people about what has 
been going on in El Salvador 
during the last ten years and to 
directly present the arguments of 
the FMLN (Farabundo Marti 
Front for National Liberation) so 
that people can make a more 
educated decision on whether or 
not to support the U.S. govern­
ment in El Salvador.
The lecture, entitled The Face 
of Revolution: A Salvadoran 
Speaks, was presented in Hamer- 
shlag B-103 by Educational Ac­
tion on Latin America, a CMU 
group dedicated to informing the 
community about the situation in 
Latin America.
As a representative of the 
FMLN,Suriano saidthatthegoal 
of the FMLN is not to violently 
overthrow the government, but to 
install a more democratic system 
in El Salvador. Currently, theU.S. 
is supporting the ARENA party, 
the political party in power in El 
Salvador.
In an interview before the lec­
ture Suriano said, “We are trying 
to develop or contribute to a true 
democratic society and obviously 
there are two conceptions of 
democracy.... The United States 
has this vision of democracy which 
excludes all the sectors of society 
from actively participating in the 
political debates in our country....

In other words, the United States 
wants a plan of democracy which 
mainly consists of this electoral 
process every five years independ­
ently or whether the people have 
the freedom to choose or not. We 
are envisioning a brand of democ­
racy which we think is more par­
ticipatory, we call it — Grassroot 
Democracy—in which the mecha­
nisms are created so that the 
population can actively put in 
their input.”
Suriano said that the most 
important change that his party 
would like to see happening in El 
Salvador is the establishment of 
atruepluralisticpolitical system, 
“a multi-party political system 
that would open the political 
spaces to the different political 
forces in our country independ­
ently of their ideology, whether 
they are members of the commu­
nist party or of the ARENAparty. 
We are hoping to have equal ac­
cess to the members of society to 
freely and openly participate in 
the political debates of the coun­
try without having their lives in 
danger, at risk of being killed.”
Suriano has a history of politi­
cal activism. “I became politically 
active in 1976 as a high school 
student,” he said, “I also partici­
pated with the Christian Demo­
crats in the elections of 1977 doing 
voter registration in poor commu­
nities. Then in 1978, when I be­
gan attending classes at the 
medical school, I founded a proj­
ect of developing popular clinics 
in poor communities and rural 
areas.... The government branded 
this effort as a communist con­
spiracy.”
According to Suriano, Commu­
nism was blamed for everything 
in El Salvador towards the end of 
the 70s. He said that Mayor 
Roberto D’Aubuisson, a leader in 
the ARENA party, was respon­
sible. “[He] was trying to blame 
everything as part of a large 
communist conspiracy trying to 
overthrow the government.... He 
institutionalized the blaming of 
communism as the element that 
was behind the efforts of people in 
church groups and groups that 
were trying to bring some reforms 
into society.”

In 1981 Suriano left El Salva­
dor as a result of death squad 
threats. After returning, he 
worked as a radio war correspon­
dent on the FMLN radio network, 
Radio Farabundo Marti. “Since 
then, I’ve been acting as a spokes­
person here in the United States 
and in other countries,” he said.
For Suriano, the constant trav­
elling and frequent lectures have 
been tiring, but he never forgets

what the people ofhis country are 
going through in El Salvador. “I 
think that a personal achieve­
ment that I would like to see 
happen is the ending of the war in 
our country and the construction 
of a true democratic society.”
He says that many people in El 
Salvador, including himself, had 
to be on the guard constantly. 
“Because of the war, obviously I 
have had many many close calls.
I’ve been forced to defend other 
people and myself. For medical 
. andradiopersonneloftheFMLN, 
one of the conditions for us to 
maintain our work :.s to be ready 
to defend ourselves. Therefore, 
carrying a weapon is more than a 
choice, it’s a necessity.... It is bad, 
you see a whole political system 
designed precisely at preventing 
people from actively participat- 
ingin the future of their country.”
A Person’s Opinion
Pat Keating, vice president for 
Planning and Business Affairs, 
stated that the Tartan Grill may 
leave Skibo during the period 
between the opening of the new 
dining hall in the new dorm 
and the new University Center.
; In its place, there might be a 
food court which would include 
a salad bar section, an a la carte 
deli counter, a pastry / bakery 
outlet with gourmet coffees and 
a special “international” 
counter.
; This “international” counter 
Would feature national cuisines 
f>r various themes for about six 
weeks at a time over a two year 
period.
Supporters say it would help 
the process of figuring out ex­
actly what the students want in 
a food service facility.
So, to help the process of fig­
uring out what students want 
in a food service system, we went 
but and asked them what they 
thought about the idea of hav­
ing a food court to replace Kiltie 
and the Tartan Grill.
*
Andrew Weiland 
Freshman, MCS
“It’s a fine idea. I think the 
dining service needs improve­
ment, but I don’t know what’s the 
best way to go about it.”
Evan Hansen 
Sophmore, CFA
“I haven’t given it much 
thought. I thought the Kiltie was 
just going to be shut down and it 
all was going to be moved over to 
the new dorm. I guess they’re 
going to use the space to make 
more money. I don’t think it’ll 
change anything. I think what we 
have is fine.”
Elyse Caplan 
Senior, CPA
“I think it’s a good idea because
I think that Kiltie food is gross. I 
think that they need better food 
around here and more healthy 
food. A lot of people are trying to 
watch their weight and you can’t 
with the shitty food. I think a food 
emporium is a good idea, because 
that gives people a bigger choice.
I think they should have more 
salads, less fried foods, more 
natural things because that’s good 
for you.”
Saleem Kazani 
Graduate, SUPA
“I prefer this use of space. Ifitis 
the same kind of facility then it 
shouldn’t be a problem.”
FroSIn tmVroan DFIiuIl vrouo T4muoi 
Sarah Grison 
Freshman, H&SS
“I don’t see why it wouldn’t be 
a good idea. It will be nice to 
have a cafeteriain the new dorm 
so you can just walk downstairs 
and eat. It’ll be nice to have 
everything in one place.”

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 13 March 1990L5
Pitt students get excited about condoms designed by CMU students
By TRUPTI PATEL
Tartan Staffwriter
It’s a tough job, but someone 
has to do it. Carnegie Mellon 
seniors Emily Parker and Dina 
Pearlman took up the difficult 
task of selling condoms door to 
door at the University of Pitts­
burgh just a few weeks ago.
Both Parker and Pearlman 
say that AIDS is definitely a 
growing killer among college 
students; their new business 
enterprise is doing something 
about that.
The condoms are designed to 
promote safe sex as and school 
spirit. The particular condoms 
sold at Pitt tote the label “Primo 
Panther Protection” and display 
a panther with a condom on his
tail. In addition, the package is 
cleverly disguised as a match- 
book and sells for $1. Pearlman 
and Parker split the 50 cent 
profit they make on each 
condom they sell.
The students decided to begin 
selling the condoms at Pitt in­
stead of Carnegie Mellon for 
purely business reasons. 
Parker, a graphic design major, 
remarks, “Pitt’s very school- 
spirited and a much larger 
school than Carnegie Mellon. 
It’s a more relaxed atmosphere 
as far as sex is concerned.”
However, Parker says that 
condoms depicting the scotty 
dog mascot may be introduced 
to the CMU campus during 
Carnival if things go well at 
Pitt. According to Parker, CMU
students have been surprisingly 
supportive of the idea.
Carnegie Mellon’s administra­
tion is supportive of Parker and 
Pearlman’s business enterprise. 
Recently, Dean of Student 
Affairs Michael Murphy called 
Pearlman and Parker in order 
to confirm that the condoms 
would be a welcome addition to 
the CMU campus. Both stu­
dents were surprised at how 
supportive the administration 
and students of CMU have been 
about the controversial ideal of 
selling condoms door to door.
On the other hand, the 
women were also surprised that 
the Pittsburgh area turned out 
to be so conservative in some 
respects. The students sent 
press releases to many major

newspapers throughout the 
country, but no one wanted the 
story. The Pittsburgh Press 
picked up the story first and 
then things started to happen. 
Local Pittsburgh radio station 
KDKA and New York station 
WOR held interviews with the 
students. Quite a few listeners 
called the station, chastising 
Parker and Pearlman for what 
they were doing and asking 
them things like, “Do you 
believe in Jesus?”
After the media rejected 
Parker and Pearlman’s press 
release, media coverage became 
phenomenal. The students ap­
peared on local Pittsburgh sta­
tion Channel 11, an affiliate of 
NBC, on March 11. Recently, 
NBC’s Connie Chung decided to 
pick up the story for her Satur­
day night program.
Parker says that the extent of 
the media coverage was totally 
unexpected. She says that the 
prime reason why there is so 
much coverage is not because 
selling condoms is such a novel 
idea, but because for the first 
time, it is happening in the 
Pittsburgh area and women are 
doing the selling.
“We got the idea to sell 
condoms because we were 
sitting around trying to think of 
a way to make money and also 
do something for society,”
Parker says.
The original idea was to have 
a condom delivery service, but 
the students learned of two 
graduates of Tufts University, 
Adam Glickman and David 
Wedel, who had started a 
condom selling service. The 
Tufts graduates branched out 
their business to over 20 cam­
puses throughout the country; 
Parker and Pearlman decided to 
pick up the torch for the Pitts­
burgh area.
-u/a
Although conservatives might 
berate Parker and Pearlman for 
selling condoms, they feel that 
their job is doing a great deal of 
good. “We’re not promoting sex. 
The fact is that people are 
having sex. The bottom line is 
that using [a condoml could 
save a life,” says Parker.
She cites statistics which 
show that one of every 300 col­
lege students contracts the 
AIDS virus; as a result, she 
says that selling condoms is a 
good idea and might help to al­
leviate the AIDS epidemic.
According to Parker and 
Pearlman, many times students 
are unwilling to enter a drug­
store and buy Trojans because 
they are embarrassed or inexpe­
rienced. Primo Panther Protec­
tion condoms sell extremely 
well among Pitt freshmen as 
well as upperclassmen.
“A novelty condom could help 
break the tension. Freshman 
seem to find themselves in situ­
ations. Upperclassmen are more 
informed, aware, and prepared,” 
says Pearlman, a professional 
writing major.
The two students’ ultimate 
goal is to market their product'0"# 
in stores in the Oakland area. 
Although many times store ----> 
managers have shown enthusi ­
asm for selling the product in 
their stores, chief executives of' 
firms are unwilling to take the*** 
risk of selling something as 
controversial as a school-spirit*-7- 
condom. “We really want to get- ?: 
[the condoms] into stores in 
Oakland. I don’t think that’s , j'' 
going to happen though,” says 1 
Parker.
So far, the condoms have had - 
a positive response at Pitt • > 
among both men and women. 
Although people are sometimes^'* 
embarrassed by Parker and 1 
Pearlman, they often buy the '*** 
condoms just because they 
think they are a funny idea. 
Sometimes, people are unre- ~ 
sponsive or unwilling to buy, 
but these people are in the 
minority.
Parker and Pearlman both 
feel that despite the hardships, 
the job is worth it. “I think thisr‘ 
has the potential to help a lot o£ >; 
people,” says Parker. ^ :

Beckett trio blackens KresgeWaiting for Godot, Endgame, and Act Without Words cast a dark shadow over the stage
By A.S. GOLDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
^ou should never laugh at 
ariother’s misfortune — didn’t 
your mother ever tell you that? 
Sure, it’s easy to snicker when 
some poor dog of a man falls flat 
on his face, but it’s also impolite.
Of course, that won’t stop most 
of us from laughing at something 
as; absolutely hilarious as a man 
trying to quench his thirst and, 
upon failing to do so, attempting 
to commit suicide. And who could 
hold back the chuckles while 
watching a filthy tramp wail in 
pain as he urinates? Ha, ha, ha.
Welcome to the wonderful world 
of Samuel Beckett — a world 
where “nothing is funnier than 
unhappiness,” and people are all 
¡tramps, cripples, cretins, and 
(most often) clueless. Beckett is 
the master of the Comedy of 
¡Unhappiness; he’s the slimy char­
acter who gets you to laugh at the 
really fat girl in the lunchroom, or 
at the teacher with a severe limp.
Beckett makes it okay to laugh 
at;the misfortune of others by 
putting the suffering on stage, 
making the characters generic 
freaks, and billing the show a 
“tragicomedy.” Sure, it’s a pathetic 
iisplay of human dissatisfaction, 
cruelty, and anguish, but it’s a 
jokje — get it?
Running now at the Kresge 
Theatre is the Samuel Beckett 
Repertory, consisting of Waiting 
?or Godot, Act Without Words I, 
ind Endgame. It is a sampling of 
ieckett’s most popular (Godot) 
nd most frustrating (Act) work. 
Jeckett’s success with an audi­
Beckett is the master of the Comedy 
of Unhappiness; he’s the slimy char­
acter who gets you to laugh at the 
really fat girl in the lunchroom, or at 
the teacher with a severe limp.
ence is dependent upon a certain 
amount of toleration of the ab­
surd and a good bit of endurance. 
Accordingly, viewing one of these 
plays (preferably Godot or 
Endgame) is a bizarre and sadis­
tically entertaining experience; 
seeing all three could cause nerve 
damage and a bout with suicidal 
depression. While the Kresge’s 
productions of Godot, Act, and 
Endgame each have their quali­
ties to recommend them, one foray 
into the Theatre of the Absurd 
should be enough for the average 
(i.e., non-Beckett-worshipping) 
theatergoer.
The least problematic of the 
plays, and ultimately the most 
accessible and enjoyable, is Godot. 
Noted as Beckett’s best piece of 
theatre, Godot chronicles two days 
in the lives of Vladimir and 
Estragon, a pair of vagabonds 
waiting in the middle of nowhere 
for the enigmatic Mr. Godot to 
come for them. The humor is 
derived from the confusion, fear, 
andhopelessness that plague the 
bums’ existence.
Anthony McKay’s direction 
plays up the slapstick to good 
effect without forfeiting much of 
the despair and anguish that lie
just beneath the play’s vaudeville 
surface. When, at the play’s end, 
a truly broken Vladimir begs 
Godot’s messenger boy to tell his 
master that “you saw me,” the 
physical comedy has come to a 
dead halt, and the haunting core 
of Beckett’s message is exposed.
What very often keeps Godot 
from becoming a morbid cacoph­
ony is a strong cast. This produc­
tion, featuring the enormously 
talented senior Brett Brenner as 
Vladimir, has just that. Brenner 
and senior Mark K. Lewis 
(Estragon) click with a terrific 
charm, whether it be silly physi­
cal comedy or fast-paced tit-for- 
tat dialogue. Senior Matthew 
Hofherr, as the bombastic tyrant, 
Pozzo, and senior Michael Waller 
as his slave, Lucky, are also dy­
namic and quite funny. Fans of 
the play will not be disappointed 
by Waller’s frantic reading of 
Lucky’s famous “speech,” and 
Hofherr makes a terrifie sadist.
Somewhat more difficult and 
less successful are Act and 
Endgame, producedback-to-back. 
To show both plays in one night is 
asking too much from the audi­
ence, and is a clear illustration of 
the limitations of Theatre of the
Absurd, which has petered out 
significantly since its heyday some 
twenty-five years ago. Act is a 
frenetic one-man pantomime 
stressing the futility of existence. 
Endgame is a post-apocalyptic 
drama stressing the futility of 
existence. And that’s only part of 
the problem.
While director Tim Carryer and 
senior Paul Kaup do an admi­
rable and truly imaginative job 
with Act's physical drama, any 
hope of enjoying the play is di­
minished by the 45 minute run­
ning time. For a pantomime, 
especially of the Beckett nature, 
to run so long is a definite bad 
move. What is at first funny — 
namely Kaup’s. consistently 
thwarted efforts to do anything
— becomes tiresome and irritat­
ing. If Beckett was trying to frus­
trate his audience, he did a com­
mendable job.
Endgame, the story of the im­
perious invalid, Hamm, works 
a bit better. David H. Eckert’s 
looming set and the tattered cos­
tumes of graduate student M.A. 
Eshelman establish the brooding, 
dismal atmosphere of the play. 
This time out, Beckett opts less 
for comedy, and spins a bizarre 
tale of Hamm, Hamm’s “cursed 
progenitors” (who live in trash 
cans), and his servant, Clov. The 
tension revolves around the ab­
sence of life outside their small 
room, and Clov’s desire to go out 
into the dead world despite the 
fact that all involved will die.
Hamm, as portrayed by gifted 
senior Ro’ee Levi, is cruel and

personality expertly, and evokes 
as much pity as disdain for his 
crippled antihero. Senior Jon­
athan Walker’s Clov is perhaps 
too mechanical, but effective, and 
is as endearing as a Beckett char­
acter gets. Paul Kaup and Melanie 
Shulman as Nagg and Nell, 
Hamm’s parents, do well with the 
little comedy that the playwright 
allots Endgame.
With a message bleak and un­
relenting, Theatre of the Absurd 
ran itself into a dead end — a 
point that will be clear to anyone 
who attends all three Beckett 
productions. Any of the three 
productions by itself will offer an 
entertaining introduction to the
bizarre genius of Samuel Beck­
ett, but the trilogy is deadly. The 
willingness of an audience to sit 
through play after play of non­
sense dialogue, bare sets, and 
relentless cynicism cannot be 
relied upon.
Beckett offered comic relief with 
his vision ofhopelessness,butthe 
jokes are loaded because he’s not 
poking fun at tramps, he’s mak­
ing a vaudeville of all human 
existence. The Beckett Repertory 
is an intro to the Comedy of 
Unhappiness, and it doesn’t take 
long to figure out just who is 
unhappy. Go ahead, laugh — it’s 
not impolite if you’re the butt of 
the joke.
Bnior Ro’ee Levi delivers a passionate prayer during Endgame.

W. Ellis Porter’s Dream comes true
By TERRI KASCH
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
The 1982 smash musical 
Dreamgirls, originally directed 
and choreographed by the late 
Michael Bennet, has been in pre­
views at the Pittsburgh Playhouse 
since March 6 and will open offi­
cially tomorrow.
This musical draws much of its 
personality from real life by bor­
rowing the story of Diana Ross 
and the Supremes. Six Carnegie 
Mellon College of Fine Arts stu­
dents appear in this show, includ­
ing talented junior W. Ellis Por­
ter, whom audiences may remem­
ber from last semester’s musical 
revue I Hear America Singing at 
Kresge. The congenial music/ 
theater major spoke to The Tar­
tan about his latest endeavor.
Porter portrays James Thun­
der Early, a character reminis­
cent of James Brown. “He’s very 
outrageous, screams a lot, sings 
really loud, acts really crazy... it’s 
very exhausting,” says Porter.
Porter has had his eye on this 
part for a long time. “I’ve always

DREAMGIRLS. A chronicle of the lives of three young women in Chicago 
who become backup singers in a rhythm and blues band. Directed by 
Danny Herman. Starring Virginia Woodruff, Natalie Belcon, Vanlta Har­
bour, Billy Porter, Kena Dorsey, Michael McElroy. At the Pittsburgh Play­
house, 222 Craft Avenue, Oakland. Performances Tuesdays through 
Sundays until April 1. For information about tickets call 621-4445.
wanted to play James Thunder 
Early since I heard the very first 
recording of the show.... I didn’t 
think it [the opportunity! was 
going to come this soon, but it’s 
here.”
Porter performed in another 
production of Dreamgirls last 
summer in Connecticut, playing 
the part of C.C. This time around, 
fellow CFA student Michael 
McElroy fills this role. Although 
Porter knows McElroy’s charac­
ter well, he does not attempt to 
advise McElroy on his perform­
ance. “Not that I wouldn’t if he 
asked, buthe doesn’t need it. He’s 
very, very capable of doing it on 
his own and I think he’d rather do
it that way. Actors are very ego­
tistical people and you don’t want 
to step on anyone’s toes.”
One of the aspects ofDreamgirls 
that Porter admires is the state­
ment that the musical makes 
about black America. “It shows 
the world that black people are 
glamorous, too. Black people can 
be rich, too. Black people can have 
wonderful careers, too.... I love it 
for that reason, because a lot of 
black theater — and I’m not say­
ing this in a derogatory way — 
but a lot of black theater is from 
the “old school” where it’s the black 
plight, where it’s the struggling 
blacks, it’s the struggling family, 
it’s the poor black people.”
Dreamgirls also touches on the 
good and bad facets of show busi­
ness in general. Still, the musical’s 
commentary on the industry as a 
whole does not intimidate him. 
“I’ve had a taste of the New York 
scene and the professional scene 
and stuff like that,” he says. “It 
gets scary. It gets very scary, but 
I never get to the point where I 
can’t take it. I just do a lot of 
praying.”
Porter and his five CFA class­
mates have had to juggle rehears­
als and performances with their 
regular Carnegie Mellon work­
load. Says Porter, “The teachers 
have been very nice. Not to say 
that we can miss class often, that 
we can not do our work or any­
thing like that. They just know 
and they understand. However, 
it’s hard. It’s really rough.” 
Having worked at the Play­
house before in a show called Chi­
cago, Porter knew what to expect 
when he took on this project. “I 
knew what I was getting myself 
into,” he said. “It’s working out. 
I’vebeen taking my vitamins, and 
lots of prayer.”

Benny Carter transcends the traditional jazz performance
If you will recall, it was just a 
few weeks ago that I was discuss­
ing the positive effect that age 
has had on jazz musicians. The 
experiences that life offers to these 
musical poets often works to 
mature their musical sense and 
therefore lead to more consistent 
and powerful performances.
The recent recording by alto 
saxophonist Benny Carter is a 
shining example of this phenome­
non, for he is today producing 
work that is unapproachable by 
many of the present generation of 
jazz performers.
Arguably one of the best alto 
saxophonists in the world today
ACCENT ON JAZZ
by Jeff Muller
(he was voted third best in the 
last Downbeat poll), Benny Car­
ter is also one of the most original 
and influential musicians that 
America has produced. Having 
recorded prolifically since the late
1920’s, Carter is today at the 
pinnacle of his abilities as song­
writer and improviser.
This is evident on his latest 
release on Pablo records, My Kind 
of Trouble. Accompanied by gui­
tarist Joe Pass, bassist Andy 
Simpkins, and drummer Ronnie 
Bedford, this is the first album 
which Carter has made with an 
organist, in this case Art Hillery. 
This collaboration, though new to 
the veteran, has worked out 
wonderfully. The group is tight 
and responsive, and although 
Pass is noted more for his virtu- 
osic solo work, he shows on this 
recording that he can accompany
tastefully and with restraint.
“Berkeley Bounce,” which opens 
up side one, sets the mood for the 
recording with its blues format. 
Carter’s solo on this tune is repre­
sentative of his abilities, for he is 
a player who doesn’t fall back on 
cliches. His melodies are fresh 
and full of unexpected twists and 
turns, and his use of dynamics is 
superb. In fact, the subtleties of 
Carter’s music are what make it 
extraordinary. Pass also offers a 
brilliant solo in the song, juxta- 
posinghis ability to deal with the 
simplicity of the blues against his 
use of more complex bebop lines.
Pass’ melodic, almost effortless
improvisations work as the per­
fect foil to Carter’s emotionally- 
edged sax lines. The combination 
comes together on “Gee Baby, 
Ain’t I Good to You,” a song which 
Carter almost didn’t include on 
the album because he had remem­
bered recording it previously. Re­
minded that he originally re­
corded it in 1929, Carter acqui­
esced, explaining: “I guess I can 
do it every 60 years or so!” 
Another highlight is bassist 
Simpkins’ solo on “Eric’s Blues,” 
demonstrating that a bassist can 
also have a very vocal approach to 
soloing. “Only Trust Your Heart,” 
which Carter originally wrote for
the 1964 movie The Hanged Man 
(through out his career he has dbTfé 
a great deal of music for teh'è 
screen), is a touchingballad, while 
“My Kind of Trouble is You” closes 
out the album with, once again 
some great bluesy soloing.
With this release Carter 4ias 
shown that he is still vital. This is 
a great recording which has malty 
elements not yet developed in 
today’s younger players. Jazz, like 
painting and composed music-,*is 
an art form that only gets better 
with age.

JOE BOB GOES TO THE 
DRIVE IN
by Joe Bob Briggs
Censors aim their sights towards the music industry
Youknow something that bums 
‘my bacon?
These same Tipper Gore lovers 
that are trying to get drive-in 
movies banned from the video 
stores are going after music now, 
and they’re actually getting these 
laws passed in Missouri and some 
other places that say you have to 
put giant yellow stickers on CD’s 
ind cassettes that say stuff like 
This song has bestiality in it.” 
And then you have to be eighteen 
buy the cassette, unless, of 
course, your Mama is training 
you in bestiality. They make an 
inception for people living in the 
)zarks.
Anyhow, they’re saying that 
there shouldn’t be any songs writ- 
fin in the following categories: 
idultery, alcohol, drugs, suicide, 
¡atanism, incest, bestiality, sado- 
nasochism, sexual activity in a 
¿Ojent context, murder, and 
iMbid violence.
So I got a question for you 
jeople: what’s left to sing about? 
Lots of people are gonna be real 
¡eked off about this.
For example, here’s a few of the 
¡ongs that’ll be labeled and 
janiied for sale to minors:
‘My Darling Clementine” — 
an’t sell that song, it’s about 
uicide.
“Ode to Billie Joe,” same thing. 
Elvis doing “Kissin’ Cousins” — 
orry, incest song, put it on the 
tanned list.
Adultery — how many thou­
sands of songs will that be? “Papa 
Was a Rolling Stone.” Almost all 
the Hank Williams songs, includ- 
ing“Your Cheatin’ Heart.” Marvin 
Gaye’s “I Heard It Through the 
Grapevine.” How bout “You 
Picked a Fine Time to Leave Me, 
Lucille”? That’s a patriotic song. 
Simon and Garfunkel’s “Mrs. 
Robinson.” Are you telling me 
we’re gonna start banning Simon 
and Garfunkel?
Come to think of it, I guess we 
could ban Simon and Garfunkel, 
that’s not so terrible.
And then how many millions of 
songs are about alcohol? The “Beer 
Barrel Polka”—you won’t be able 
to sell that one! What will Polish 
people do? “Wastin Away in 
Margaritaville.” “Days of Wine 
and Roses” — that whole dang 
song’s about alcohol. “Tequila.”
And how about the Drugs cate­
gory? If you’re under eighteen, 
just forget about buying “Minnie 
the Moocher”by Cab Calloway, or 
Eric Clapton’s “Cocaine.” In fact, 
forget about just about every song 
in “The Blues Brothers.”
But I’ll tell you what really 
bums me up, is this Satanism 
category. I think kids oughta be 
able to buy Charlie Daniels doing 
“The Devil Went Down to Geor­
gia” if they want to, and I’m sorry, 
but if they ban Frank Sinatra 
doing “That Old Black Magic,” we 
might just have a little revolution 
on our hands.
Listen to me, on this labeling 
songs according to content, you 
people are sick.
Does Frank know about this?
What about the complete works 
of Black Sabbath?
Sorry I’m babbling about this, 
but these people are serious.
Ray Charles is in big trouble: 
“Let’s Go Get Stoned.”
“Goodnight Irene” is about sui­
cide.
Any song by Steppenwolf!
Are you guys getting the idea
here. Make some noise. Send some 
postcards. Play “Sympathy for the 
Devil” at 340 decibels.
Let’s kick some hiney before 
these loonies win another one.
I don’t wanna have to tell you 
again.
Speaking of stuffthat will annoy 
your mother, Nightbreed just 
came out, latest movie from Clive 
Barker, the King of Gooey Crud 
on the screen, creator of Hell- 
raiser, all-round kinky-sex-and- 
violence kinda guy. Clive’s idea of 
a great time is to have a night­
mare about a woman with three 
heads and no skin who flays your 
body with a pitchfork. To give you 
some idea, Nightbreed has over 
200 pus monsters, including one 
guy with a crescent moonhead 
like the McDonald’s commercial 
and a fat guy with snakes that 
pop out of his stomach and eat 
your face off, and these are the 
good guys. These are the people 
we’re supposed to like.
All these slime-glopola mon­
sters live in a place called Midian, 
which is underneath a cemetery 
in northern Canada, which is 
where a weirdbeard psychiatrist 
spongehead is slashing house­
wives and wasting innocent sub­
urbanites. To make it even scar­
ier, the maniac mass murderer is 
David Cronenberg! The guy who 
directed The Fly, The Brood, 
Rabidl The kinkiest man in Can­
ada! The guy who makes movies 
about viruses that are so weird 
they make disgusting bloody 
power drills come up out of Mari­
lyn Chambers’ armpits and bur­
row into your heart until you’re a 
flesh-eating zombie! So we’ve got 
the kinkiest man in Canada and 
the kinkiest man in England, and 
they’re spewing slime together\
There’s a whole lot of plot get­
ting in the way of the story, 
though, and so what happens is 
the weirdbeard psychiatrist tries 
to pin his 37 mass murders on
this innocent kid who’s his pa­
tient but has these dreams all the 
time about a land full of special- 
effects makeup where Intestine- 
Head Norwegians live in cages. 
Pretty soon the psychiatrist sets 
him up, the local Nazi cops blow 
the kid away, and the kid ends up 
in Midian, the place where the 
monsters live, and where the kid 
is becoming a monster himself. 
It’s sort of an Alice in Wonderland 
deal, but instead of the Mad 
Hatter, these people are like the 
Mad Shish-ka-bobbers. The kid’s 
girlfriend decides to go to Midian 
herself, mainly cause she’s will­
ing to continue the relationship 
even though he’s dead (it’s a nine­
ties thing). But what she doesn’t 
knowis she tips off David Cronen­
berg to where the monsters live, 
and so here comes the Canadian 
National Guard with about 700 
troops, flamethrowers, explosives, 
and 74,000 rounds of ammo. Will 
the cute little mucus mummies 
survive? Nine thousand special 
effects closeups later, we finally 
get the answer. Unfortunately, I 
was so exhausted by then, I don’t 
remember what the answer is.
Six breasts. Sixty-six dead 
bodies. One motor vehicle chase, 
with pickup plunging into the 
center of the earth. Killer porcu­
pine breasts. Explodingmonsters. 
Throat slashing. Bimbo staking. 
Head hacking. Closeup of a guy 
cutting off his own face. Whim­
pering mutant E.T. dog that turns

:CC tries to force NYC alternative music station to sign off
Ifyou’re from the NYC metro- 
òlitan area, or even if you’re not, 
ili may have listened to WFMU 
11.1 FM). If you’re smart, you 
sténed to it a lot, since it’s the 
lost diverse and interesting radio 
ation in New York City, playing 
le independent and alternative 
usic unfairly ignored by most 
ew York stations. WFMU is 
rated in Upsala College, but 
eceives no money from them, 
lerating as a public radio sta- 
on instead.
Lately, though, WFMU is in 
Ime amount of trouble. It seems 
lat their antenna tower is some-

in the wrong geographic position, 
or is too tall, or something equally 
unalterable). While thishad never 
been a problem before — the FCC 
has never said anything previ­
ously, and the station has been 
operating with that setup for at
least three years — three other 
New York radio stations are now 
protesting that WFMU’s signal is 
interfering with their transmis­
sion, and they want WFMU’s 
power cut back to unobtrusive 
levels.
As a public radio station, 
WFMU relies upon public dona­
tions to keep them afloat. The 
power cut demanded by the other 
radio stations would shrink the 
radio station’s broadcast range, 
effectively shutting out most of 
the densely populated NYC met- 
ropolitarian area. If the cut hap­
pens, WFMU would lose too many 
listeners, and contributors, to 
remain operative.
That doesn’t mean that they 
could continue to operate at a 
lower power level. It means that 
they wouldn’t have enough money 
to continue broadcasting at all.
Now, aside from the fact that 
the three other stations already 
outweigh WFMU by ahefty chunk 
of wattage (they’re in the tens 
and hundreds of thousands, 
whereas WFMU has a compara­
tively puny 1,440 watts), it seems 
abitunfairfor three similar public 
radio stations to pull a squash 
action on a smaller relative, espe­
cially when the smaller relative 
serves a listening audience well 
outside of their programming 
style.
WFMU is a cool station that 
doesn’t need this bullshit. Write 
tothemtofindoutwhoyoushould 
write to at the FCC (their case is 
unique in that nothing similar 
has ever been fought about). If 
you’d like to know more about the 
station, you can ask for a copy of 
their program guide, which is 
chock-full of nifty stories and car­
toons along with the normal 
schedule info. It’s the best in the 
nation. (It’s also free in the NYC 
area, but it costs $1.05 to mail, so 
be nice and send them a buck.) 
Their address is WFMU, Upsala 
College, East Orange, NJ, 07019.
On the local broadcast front, 
President Cyert will be answer-
ingquestions on WRCT (88.3 FM, 
in case you still don’t know) to­
night at 6pm, so call in and give 
Dick a piece ofyourmind. Follow­
ing that, the Northern Bushmen 
will be playing at 8:30, so tune in 
and check out some local music.
On the non-broadcastfront, Die 
Kreuzen is at the Decade tonight, 
Laurie Anderson will be at the 
Syria Mosque on Thursday, and 
Thin White Line, Uncle Sydney, 
and Illuminatus will be at the 
Upstage on Friday. Now get out of 
here.

The Battleship Potemkin
Although short —just over an hour — this classic 
makes good use of the time. Directed by Soviet 
filmmaking pioneer Sergei Eisenstein, this 1925 si­
lent picture was first released by the Soviet govern­
ment as propaganda supporting those who initially 
revolted against the Czar. It deals with the outcome 
of a mutiny on the Russian battleship Potemkin. The 
scene of the massacre of civilians on the steps of 
Odessa is enough of a reason to see this movie, but if 
it isn’t, then the photography, editing, and directorial 
technique should be. Keep an eye out for Eisenstein’s 
technique of montage, the synergisticjuxtaposition of 
images to create meaning.

Dad
It’s another one of those movies about father-son 
relationships, this time with a Carnegie Mellon twist. 
In this one, CMU alum Ted Danson plays an execu­
tive who hasn’t had much time for his family until his 
mother (Olympia Dukakis) has a heart attack and his 
father (Jack Lemmon) needs to be “looked after.” 
Ethan Hawke spent a semester at CMU last year 
before he left to make Dead Poets’ Society; in Dad, he 
plays the son who gets along better with his grandfa­
ther than with his father. Even though the movie spe­
cializes in emotional mood swings and has a con­
trived ending that’ll probably leave you crying.and 
feeling cheated, it’s worth the dollar.

Crimes and Misdemeanors
In Woody Allen’s latest movie, Martin Landau 
plays a rich optometrist who avoids the Fatal Attrac­
tion syndrome by having his jealous ex-lover killed. 
For the rest of the movie, he struggles with his con­
science. Meanwhile, off in a parallel story line, Allen 
gets himself in a love triangle with Mia Farrow and 
Alan Alda that has less to do with lust than with 
values. The comparison between Landau and Allen 
provides both the movie’s title and the familiar Woody

Kevin Costner stars as Eliot Ness in the Academy Award winning 
suspense drama The Untouchables.
Sunday, March 18
The Untouchables
Along with No Way Out, this 1987 reworking of an 
old television series is the movie that made Kevin 
Costner famous. He plays the straight-arrow federal 
agent Eliot Ness, who goes after the gangster A1 Ca­
pone (Robert DeNiro) by recruiting a small band of 
honest policemen. They become known as “The Un­
touchables” because in the corrupt Chicago political 
system, they can’t be bribed by the mob. As the 
veteran Chicago beat cop who helps Ness, Sean Con­
nery delivers an Oscar-winning performance, and 
Andy Garcia has a small but important role as a new 
cop with perfect aim. Like any other Brian De Palma 
film, this melodrama — in which everyone is either 
all good or all bad — offers a lot of violence and a lot 
of tension. It’s a lot of fun, too.

Rip-roaring comedy Tom Jones visits the Playhouse
— Movie Review —
???? TOM JONES. Based on the novel of the same name by Henry 
Fielding. Fielding’s forte is the picaresque novel, stories that artfully 
combine bawdy characters with rollicking adventures and humorous 
perks of plot. Directed by Tony Richardson. Starring Albert Finny (Tom), 
Susannah York (Sophie Western), Hugh Griffith (Squire Western), George 
Devine (Squire Allworthy). At the Pittsburgh Playhouse through Thursday. 
7:30 and 9:45 pm nightly.
By MICHELLE JONES
Tartan Staff writer
Since its release in 1963, Tom 
Jones has proceeded to both shock 
and amuse audiences. The mix 
was apparently a good one; the 
film won four (including Best 
Director and Best Picture) out of 
the ten academy awards for which 
it received nominations.
That wasn’t good enough for 
director Tony Richardson, who 
took a fresh look at the film and 
felt that changes were needed. As 
a result, the new version has about 
seven minutes less footage. In 
addition, the sound and effects 
were completely over-hauled by 
John Addison, who won the Oscar 
for the original.
For the first time in seven years, 
Tom Jones is being re-released 
(with changes), courtesy of the 
Pittsburgh Playhouse.
The film opens as a take-off of 
silent films. The parts are over­
acted, the camera movements are 
quick, and the title cards are 
concise. Our hero, Tom, is but a 
baby abandoned not at the door­
step, but on the bed of Squire 
Allworthy (George Divine). The 
Squire declares little Tom his 
ward, and the adventure begins.
While his activities on Squire 
All worthy’s estate are hysterical, 
it is when Tom (Albert Finney) 
hits the road for London that the 
fun begins in earnest. There’s 
almost too much to talk about. 
Tom spends his days much as any 
picaresque hero does, falling in 
and out of favor with his benefac­
tor, meeting new adversaries at 
regular intervals, saving damsels 
in distress, and, of course, experi­
encing drastic and unpredictable 
changes in fortune and social 
standing.
All of this means action — lots 
of chases, brawls, and narrow es­
capes. One brawl takes place in a 
churchyard and might have set 
the precedent for mud-wrestling. 
The village women sling dirt, 
grass, and yes, human bones in a
determined effort to expel the local 
slut.
The characters are extremely 
entertaining. Of his title role in 
Tom Jones, Finney has said that 
it wasn’t hard work, but was actu­
ally somewhat tiresome. At any 
rate, Finney's character looks as 
though he’s having considerably 
more fun.
The rest of the cast rounds out 
delightfully. There’s the prissy 
girlfriend, Sophie Western, played 
by Susannah York, who surpris­
ingly has enough spunk to climb 
out of the tower in which her 
father at one point imprisons her. 
Her father, Squire Western (Hugh 
Griffith), is a madcap, uncouth 
fellow called both a “country clod” 
and a “goat” by his pristine sister. 
Despite these faults, Squire
Western knows how to throw a 
party and a graphically depicted 
deer hunt, which is almost as of­
fensive as his table manners.
The film preserves the humor 
and high pace of Fielding’s work, 
partly due to Richardson’s choice 
of cinematic devices and the skill 
of screen writer John Osborne. The 
team selected devices especially 
suited for translating Fielding-to 
the screen and modern modes of 
discourse. Scenes are often 
changed by wipes or flash-cuts 
depending on the nature of the 
moment. Such techniques w.eft 
innovative at the time of the film’s 
release and still work within the 
context.
Another clever device is the 
incorporation of character asides! 
Whether a quick glance to the 
audience by Tom as yet another 
woman shows interest in his 
“services” or a full-fledged address 
by Jenny Jones near the end of 
the film, the asides loosen the 
tale’s framework just enough to 
make it fit more comfortably.
The Pittsburgh Playhouse will 
show Tom Jones through March 
16. The film can be classified as 
extremely hard to find; don’t miss 
your chance to catch this comedy 
masterpiece.

Style and magic materialize before your eyes at Heinz Hall
By STEPHEN TOROK
tfartan Staffwriter
There are only a few magicians who 
have successfully etched their names 
(jiTthe public’s awareness. Harry Houd- 
jni and Harry Blackstone spring to 
tfiind right away.
Only one magician, however, has ac- 
eomplished this in addition to being 
tamed one of the ten best dressed men 
in America. Master magician David 
Copperfield is bringing his unique 
brand of magic as well as his stylish 
wardrobe to Pittsburgh at the end of 
this month.
Copperfield is by far the best known 
living magician, thanks to the success 
ofhis many television specials. He has 
jroduced and starred in no less than 
eleven specials to date and has re- 
téived Emmy awards for more than 
half. The days of the magician pulling 
rabbit out of a hat are a thing of the 
. In his career Copperfield has 
inade the Statue of Liberty disappear,
— Performance Preview —
THE MAGIC OF DAVID COPPERFIELD.
At Heinz Hall, 600 Penn Avenue, Down­
town Pittsburgh. Performances on March 
26 and 27 at 5:30 and 8:30 pm,. Ticket 
prices are $22.50, $19.50, and $15.50.

walked through the Great Wall of 
China, escaped from Alcatraz, and 
caused a seven ton jet airplane to 
vanish. He always takes on a chal­
lenge.
Copperfield’s 1990 tour The Magic 
of David Copperfield is no exception. 
It features the incredible Death Saw 
Illusion, in which Copperfield is shack­
led and chained beneath a six-foot, 
slowly descending buzz saw. This illu­
sion is also a twist on the traditional 
saw-the-lady-in-half trick. Copperfield 
is dismembered into not two but nine
parts.
The unbelievable dexterity of 
Copperfield’s hands as well as his more 
traditional skills as a magician, are 
featured in the sleight of hand portion 
ofthe program. In some ofhis previous 
performances, the climax of the show 
has been the vanishing, in mid-air, of a 
700-pound motorcycle. But it’s hard to 
predict exactly what the upcoming act 
will be like, because Copperfield 
changes it every couple of weeks.
Nevertheless, fasten your seat belt, 
because you’re sure to see a dazzling 
light show and hear music more at­
tuned to a music video than a magic 
act. From Mozart to Harry Belefonte to 
Eddie Money, music plays a crucial 
role in Copperfield’s show. He even in­
corporates theater into the program. A 
consummate performer and veteran of 
both stage and cinema, Copperfield 
acts in short romantic and entertain­
ing theater pieces which serve both to 
introduce and set the mood to his illu­
sions. This adds a dimension to his
show that makes it both original and 
unique.
For animal lovers, the show features 
TV personality Webster the Duck. 
Webster has appeared in several of 
Copperfield’s specials. You might also 
see Consuelo the Chicken, a number of 
canaries and, just maybe, Elvis the 
Pig. Elvis has yet to appear in the 
show, but tours with the troupe none­
theless. Maybe, if we’re lucky, he’ll 
make his debut performance in Pitts­
burgh.
The MagicofDavid Copperfield pres­
ents the light show and music of a con­
cert, the acting of a theater production 
and, of course, the dazzling feats of 
magic of a world class magician. All 
this, when placed on an extravagant 
set of Copperfield’s own design,makes 
for an exciting and highly entertaining 
evening. So if you are a lover of roman­
tic theater, music, animals, or high 
fashion—but, above all, a fan of magic 
and illusion — plan on seeing The 
Magic of David Copperfield.

‘The Egyptian Exhibit has been 
one of the most popular exhibits 
that I can remember. The re­
sponse, especially to the mum­
mies, has been phenomenal,” 
comments one Carnegie Museum 
Guard.
The Walton Hall of Ancient 
Egypt opened on February 10 at 
the Carnegie Museum of Natural 
History. This one-of-a-kind per­
manent exhibit takes an unique 
approach to examining ancient 
civilizations.

tend to concentrate on the 
civilization’s artwork. The Wal­
ton exhibit is unique because it 
takes an anthropological ap­
proach to Egypt. The exhibit fo­
cuses on middle-class Egyptians 
and their social roles, daily activi­
ties, and beliefs. Artifacts in the 
exhibit range from the common­
place, such as cooking pots, to the 
unusual, such as preserved meat 
offerings.
Seven different themes are 
showcased in the Walton Hall — 
Cultural Evolution, World View, 
Nautical Tradition, Social Organi­
zation, Crafts, Daily Life, and 
Funerary Religion. These themes 
present a comprehensive view of
the entire Ancient Egyptian cul­
ture and its relation to Egypt 
today. Each theme has a separate 
section.
The highlight ofthe new hall is 
a 3800-year-old funerary boat 
used to transport corpses down 
the Nile, which was purchased 
for the Museum of Natural His­
tory by Andrew Carnegie. Another 
highlight is the reconstructed 
tomb of Sennedjem, which is ac­
companied by an explanation of 
the mummification process. Other 
items of interest include jewelry, 
ceramics, mummified animals, 
and a recreation of a predynastic 
grave.
Extensive research was done to
recreate the hieroglyphics and in-: 
scriptions that accompany the! 
artifacts. Artists traveled to Egypt 
to insure their accuracy, and films, 
from these travels can be seen in! 
a video kiosk. Additional infor­
mation on Ancient Egypt can be 
obtained by using the exhibit’s,; 
computer station.
The Walton Hall of Ancient. 
Egypt can be easily spotted be­
cause of the colossal Offering Dio- 
rama at the entrance. The exhibit 
is extremely well presented and 
is a joy to visit. So take a break, ; 
walk on down to the Carnegie 
Museum, and prepare to be trans- ; 
ported over to the banks of thei 
River Nile.
