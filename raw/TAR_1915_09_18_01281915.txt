WRITES ABOUT EPOCH-MAKING 
EVENT
(ARNEGIE DEFEATS GETTYSBURG
PLAID PLATS FINE GAME AND WINS 4410 37
An epoch-making event was the 
transmission of speech through the 
telephone between San Francisco and 
New York. The Director is fortunate 
in having received a letter from Dr. 
John A. Brashear, who was one of 
those present on this wonderful occa­
sion. His recent election to the Pres­
idency of the American Institute of 
Mechanical Engineers makes him one 
of the most prominent figures in the 
scientific life of America and I am 
sure that all the students will be in­
terested in his letter which is here­
with printed in part:
New York, N. Y. 
January 24,1915. 
Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag, Director,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Penna.
My dear Director:
On Friday afternoon, Mr. Carty, 
Chief Engineer of the American Bell 
Telephone Co., called me by “Long 
Distance”, asking me to be his guest 
on Sunday afternoon to meet Dr. 
Alexander G. Bell and a few others to 
send and hear the first messages over 
the transcontinental line to San Fran­
cisco.
As I had arranged to come on to the 
dinner to be given to Mr. Swasey 
Tuesday evening by the Allied Engi­
neering Societies and to be present at 
the meeting next evening when he was 
to make an endowment of $250,000 
for engineering research, I concluded 
to accept Mr. Carty’s invitation. So 
I left Pittsburgh at 11:20 last night 
and was on hand to take part in the 
wonderful development of telephon­
ing.
The great event is to come off to­
morrow with Mr. Bell, Mrs. Bell and 
the Mayor of New York, with the 
Presidents of the four Engineering 
Societies as guests and I presume a 
few* others.
But today, Dr. Bell, his son-in-law, 
Mr. Grosvenor, (Editor of the Na­
tional Geographic Magazine), his twin 
brother and Grosvenor’s son, and 
your friend, “Uncle” John, were the 
only ones outside of the telephone 
officials.
I thought I wrould wrrite just a line 
for if I can find time in my busy life 
when I return, I think I ought to tell 
your boys of Tech about the wonder­
ful affair.
First, they had an exact model of 
the first telephone and this was con­
nected up with several receivers in the

By playing some excellent basket­
ball Carnegie’s five overcame Gettys­
burg’s »team on the home floor last 
Saturday night by the score 44 to 
37. The Plaid team went into the 
game with the object of making up 
for their previous defeats, and they 
certainly gained what they went after. 
The brand of basket-ball which they 
played was far superior to that ex­
hibited a couple of weeks ago, and 
it is to be hoped that they will keep 
up their present form throughout 
the remainder of the season. Carne­
gie’s team work and shooting were 
excellent while Gettysburg likewise 
had good form. The visitors guard­
ing, however, seemed a trifle weak at 
times.
The game was an up-hill one in 
every respect and the visitor’s put up 
an excellent fight. Several times dur­
ing the first half the scores stood tie, 
but Carnegie managed finally, to gain 
a lead and maintained it until the end. 
But several times this lead was only 
a narrow margin of one point.
The good spirit shown by the Plaid 
rooters was a noticeable feature and 
many cheers were given before the 
game and during the intermission.
The new coach A1 Wagner and his 
assistant, Hans Wagner w^ere present 
and, although they had been in charge 
only a day they seemed to have pro­
duced good effects.
Captain Hines of Carnegie played 
as is usually the case, an excellent 
game, guarding skillfully and doing 
a lot of scoring by means of fouls, 
Captain Mahaffie, the visitor’s right 
forward added 22 points out of a pos­
sible 25 to Gettysburg’h score by 
dropping in fouls. Although a large 
number of fouls were called, the game 
wras not a rough one, and almost all 
were on technical points.
Levy led the Plaid five in the num­
ber of field goals and put up a brilliant 
game. Campbell, Gettysburg’s center 
played a crack game, and had four 
baskets to his credit.
First Half.
Captain Hines started the scoring 
as soon as the ball was put into play 
by shooting a basket. Mahaffie tossed 
a foul. Hines put one in from the 
foul line and Mahaffie put a couple 
more in from the same spot, thus 
evening the score at 3 to 3. Mahaffie 
then put in another foul, but Hines 
evened the score again by adding a 
point in the same manner. Meredith 
caged a goal and gave Tech the lead. 
Mahaffie added a tally by dropping in

LARGE CROWD AT EXCELLENT 
ENTERTAINMENT
another foul. Hines put Carnegie four 
points to the good by adding three 
more fouls, leaving the score 9 to 5.
Mahaffie popped in a foul and 
Campbell shot a couple of baskets and 
put Gettysburg one point ahead w-ith 
the score 10 to 9. Hines shot a foul. 
Levy made a basket and Turnbull 
dropped one in, tying the score again. 
Hines gave Carnegie the lead by put­
ting the ball through twice from the 
foul line. Schiffer added a nice bas­
ket. Hines put in another foul and 
Mahaffie scored in like manner. Then 
Carnegie’s captain put one in on a 
long and difficult shot and Schiffer 
immediately dropped one in at close 
range. Mahaffie tossed the ball in 
twice on a double foul and added an­
other point after Hines had tossed 
a foul. Campbell made another nice 
shot and put the ball in. Levy caused 
some cheering by making a pretty 
basket and Hines came across with 
another foul goal before the half 
ended. Score: Carnegie 26, Gettys­
burg 19. Second Half.
Meredith led off with a basket. Ma­
haffie scored twnce on a double foul. 
Williams tossed the ball in. Hines 
scored on a foul and Mahaffie made 
two more tallies on another double 
foul. Hines put the ball in from the 
foul line again. Campbell made a 
basket and Williams tossed the ball 
in. Hines and Mahaffie both scored 
on fouls. Hines scored once more 
from the foul line. Levy made a bas­
ket. Mahaffie tossed in a foul and 
Hines immediately did likewise. Wil­
liams made a basket. Hines and Ma­
haffie both scored on a double foul. 
Hines scored again on another foul 
and Mahaffie did the same. Hines put 
in his part of a double foul while Ma­
haffie failed. Hines caged a foul. Levy 
made a basket. Hines and Mahaffie 
each put in a couple of fouls in alter­
nating order and Levy shot the last 
field goal of the game. The line-up:

The Smoker and Minstrel shoAV ten­
dered the Faculty, Upper and Middle 
Classmen by the Industries Plebes 
last Friday evening in the Central 
Building was one of the best of its 
kind ever presented at Tech. The 
Minstrel proper was in the form of a 
mock meeting of the Student Assem­
bly in which President Murphy was 
cleverly impersonated by Maguire in 
the capacity of interlocutor.
As the curtains were drawm aside 
twenty-five Plebes chimed in the open­
ing chorus, dressed in their shop jump­
ers and a huge green necktie emblaz­
oning each chest. Following repeated 
knocks with the giant gavel, the chair­
man finally obtained order after w^hich 
the end men disported themselves to 
the amusement of the audience. Solos 
were sung and the jokes sprung upon 
Faculty and students together writh the 
mock reports of the various commit­
tee chairmen served to increase the 
merriment of the gathering. Active 
members of the regular Student As­
sembly were splendidly impersonated 
and the important occurrences of the 
year wrere imitated wdth such exact­
ness as to leave no one misinformed 
who the original might be.
Following the Minstrel an Olio was 
given, participated in by Tom Moley 
and Industries talent in general. 
“Sox” Price, w'ith his “yiddischer” 
songs and monologue enlivened the 
audience, springing several good jokes 
on members of the Faculty. The Dry 
Schlitzells w'as next offered by Bobbie 
Vey and his excellent solo wrork on 
that one-string instrument necessi­
tated several encores. Peters drewr 
rounds of laughter with his “Oh, How 
That Woman Could Cook” and ended 
with a parody on the Beanery which 
caged a goal. A diversion wras fur­
nished by a Plebe trio in the way of 
a mouth organ recital followed by 
Ralph Merker’s splendid baritone solo 
and a guitar and mandolin quartette, 
all of which wrere well received. One 
of the evening’s features was Plebe 
Martin’s contortion exhibition and 
trapeze work which stamped him as 
an unusually fine entertainer. A bag­
piper, dressed in kilties, was also at 
hand and enlivened the Smoker with 
numerous Scotch airs.
After the Olio, the prize dancing 
competition brought forth numerous 
stag couples whose grace equalled that 
of the ladies. Dean Connelley and 
members of the Faculty acted as

NO TARTAN NEXT WEEK.
Owing to the fact that a large num­
ber of students will be absent from 
school next week on inspection trips, 
there will be no issue of The Tartan. 
The first issue of the second semester 
will appear as usual on Thursday, Feb­
ruary 11.
A WELCOME TO THE C. I. T. 
ECONOMIC SOCIETY.
January 24, 1915. 
Editor of The Tartan:
In the last issues of The Tartan 
there appeared announcements that 
a new organization, C. I. T. Economic 
Society, has been added to our student 
activities, wTith the object to study 
Socialism. That such an organization 
has been long awaited, and that it is 
of great importance to us, can hardly 
be denied by any student realizing the 
scope of our Institute.
It is often surprising if not discour­
aging to hear many students abhorring 
the mere word “Socialism” because of 
the wTrong impression left by its fanat­
ic advocates, or prejudiced opponents. 
I hope that my impression of Social­
ism is not misleading, and can be 
stated as follows:
That is is primarily a sincere at­
tempt to analyze the capitalistic so­
ciety, and to determine its efficiency 
from the standpoint of the general 
welfare of the common public. Then, 
wherever the results of the analysis 
prove that Capitalism has outlived its 
existence, it is the secondary object 
of Socialism to substitute instead the 
collective ownership of the means of 
production.
Socialism is chiefly concerned with 
the working people, and its philosophy 
is somewhat antagonistic to undemo­
cratic ideas. But that does not mean 
that our organization must be revo­
lutionary, or sentimental to warrant its 
existence. Rather an impartial anal­
ysis of current events may be of far 
more importance to us in our future 
life facing similar struggles than a 
ready-made cure for all evils.
In conclusion, I wish to welcome the 
birth of this new organization, where­
by we may enlarge our intellectual 
activities at Carnegie.
Sincerely,
JOS. MARSHAK.

Dear Mr. Calderwood:
I am sending you a copy of our cata­
logue No. 70 which I think may be of 
interest since one of your former stu­
dents was instrumental in developing 
this folder, securing patent and as­
signing same to this company as well 
as pushing the advertising and selling 
campaign which has so far promised 
to be very fruitful. In this connection 
I have made use of the information 
received in the wiring course wdiich 
wras given under your direction.
Upon receipt of copies of the patent 
papers from Washington, I will be 
pleased to supply you with several as 
they may be of some slight education­
al value and general interest to your 
students.
Yours sincerely,
L. E. GRISWOLD, ’13.

Griswold’s modesty prevented him 
from stating that he is the “former” 
student to whom he refers. The “hold­
er” is a shade or globe holder, espe­
cially designed to prevent breakage of 
globes, and to facilitate cleaning of 
outer globes. It fills a long-felt wrant

the Macbeth-Evans Glass Co.
LETTER FROM “UNCLE JOHN”
Continued from Page 1 
room where we were, in the Phone 
Building, 15 Day street. The mes­
sages went as far as Omaha and re­
turn without being re-transmitted 
from Omaha, which I believe made 
the line 1500 miles each way or 3000 
miles. Dr. Bell talked to me through 
the model phone over this 3000 miles 
with perfect enunciation and the mes­
sage came to me as if in the next 
room.
Then we were connected with Bos­
ton, Jekyl Island and San Francisco, 
Mr. Higginson at the phone in Bos­
ton, Mr. Vale, President of the Com­
pany at Jekyl Island, and Mr. Watson, 
Mr. Bell’s friend, who was the first to 
listen in his telephone. When one 
wrould talk, all could hear and as we 
had auxiliary receivers, we could all 
hear and talk from Boston to New 
York, from Jekyl Island to New York, 
and from these two places to San
Francisco, as also from our station 
and San Francisco to all three. The 
San Francisco messages could all be 
made out but the “timbre” of Mr. 
Watson’s voice was not what it should 
be for such a message. Evidently he 
must be well up in years but it was 
most remarkable that we could hear 
and distinguish the words as well.
Other interesting experiments were 
made and I stayed till dark, charmed 
with the marvelous revelation of the 
capabilities of the phone.
Dr. Bell was very happy and while 
his wife cannot hear nor did Mrs. 
Bell’s mother ever hear a message in 
the phone, I am glad Mrs. Bell can be 
with us.
All good wishes to all from
UNCLE JOHN.
NO GAME SATURDAY.
There will be no basketball game 
at the gymnasium this week, the W. 
& J. game having been cancelled. The 
next game at the gymnasium will be 
on Friday, February 6th, with the 
Westinghouse Club.
ASSISTANT ATHLETIC 
TREASURER.
The Board of Control has announced 
that the position of assistant athletic 
treasurer is now open. Applicants 
should apply to H. R. Applegate, 
Treasurer.
THE GRAND.
Vaudeville at the Grand Opera 
House next week will provide a meas­
ure of diversion for Mr. Davis’ dis­
criminating clientele that will overflow 
with mirth. There are to be nine dis­
tinctive headline features in a pro­
gram which will be given every after­
noon and evening. Prominent among 
these will be the appearance of the 
gorgeous and statuesque Kitty Gor­
don, former star of “Alma, Woh 
Wonst Du” and titled Englishwoman. 
Miss Gordon will play “Alma’s Re­
turn,” a comedy drama written by 
Jack Lait. As if to show the tre­
mendous contrasts possible in vaude­
ville, Mr. Davis announces the first 
appearance here of Richard Have- 
man’s performing animals, kings of 
the forest and desert, that have been 
completely subjugated and taught to 
do things entirely remarkable. Miss 
Jane Connelly and Players will offer 
“A Strong Cup of Tea,” a comedy of 
modern life by Erwin Connelly. It 
is a dialogue of wits, with the oppo­
site sexes arrayed, and abounds with 
bright lines, clever repartee and curi­
ous situations. Frank Mullane, called 
“the Irish Hebrew,” will give a mono­
logue in which two races will be pleas­
antly caricatured—pleasantly but in­
offensively. Charming music will be 
provided on the banjo and the violin 
by Jack McCloud and A1 Carp, enter­
tainers of quality. Some juggling and 
equilibrism will be shown by the Toyo 
Troupe, a quartet of Japanese. George
E. Delmore and W. de Graaf Lee will 
give an original physical novelty en­
titled “A Study of Black and White.” 
There will be various other attrac­
tions, in addition to moving pictures 
of the war.

INTERCOLLEGIATE NOTES.
Two freshmen women at the Uni­
versity of Illinois registered in the 
military department.
A $150,000 memorial is to be erected 
by alumni of the University of Illinois 
in honor of the first president of that 
institution, Dr. John Milton Gregory. 
This university dedicated during the 
last year a new hall which is to be 
used as an armory and convention 
hall.
The sophomores of the University 
of California have decided that corn­
cob pipes shall henceforth be used 
by the freshmen as the class emblem.

Unexpectedly breaking the Campus 
silence of yesterday afternoon, the 
first year specials of the Architectural 
School, clad in brown, started the pre­
liminaries of the annual Smock Fight 
by a parade around College Hall. The 
upperclass Architects, quickly resent­
ing the parade, marched on the parad- 
ers in a body.
Fierce conflict quickly followed. 
With sacks of flour and bags of water 
as weapons, a free-for-all soon re­
sulted. The object of the fight was 
to tear off the smocks of the opposi­
tion, and soon large rents were made 
in the coats of bright blue and bril­
liant brown. After about ten minutes 
of struggle the fight was declared a 
draw and the combatants returned to 
their easels and sketching boards.
The fight is copied from the annual 
affair at the Beaux Arts, and was in­
troduced here by Prof. Paul Cret, who 
is at present in the French army. For­
merly the fight was held within doors, 
but because of the usual damage done 
it was transferred this year to the 
Campus.—The Pennsylvanian.

WAR SEARCHLIGHTS.
New searchlights that form exceed­
ingly difficult targets for an enemy’s 
shots are now used in the European 
war, having been perfected just be­
fore it commenced. Ordinary search­
lights are, of course, good marks for 
an enemy, though not so good as 
might be expected. Their use on a 
battle line has many restrictions be­
cause of the aim they afford.
The new lights are designed to have 
all the power of the biggest search­
lights in the service, but to offer a 
target no larger than a baseball. The 
reflectors of these lights are three 
feet in diameter, but all the light rays 
are so accurately reflected that they 
can be sent through a three-inch ori­
fice. Thus the light can be armored 
against attack by small-arm fire or 
quick-firing machine guns, leaving 
open only a three-inch aperture.
As a further protection against 
shots, the reflector glass is composed 
of many small sections, bound to­
gether by wire netting, which will 
hold the parts together even after be­
ing hit.—Saturday Evening Post.

HISTORY OF THE SCIENCES.
A New and Better Method of Teach­
ing Science.
The following article appeared in a 
recent issue of “Science.” It was 
written by Dr. Walter Libby, of the 
School of Applied Industries, and will 
no doubt be of special interest to the 
readers of the Tartan:
“It is of course widely recognized 
that the individual sciences would be 
better taught if presented on an his­
torical background; we know most 
vividly what we know in its origins. 
An old-fashioned course in chemistry 
taught us that oxygen was a colorless, 
tasteless, odorless gas, non-combusti­
ble, and left it to later chance reading 
to diclose the thrilling story of the 
discovery of oxygen. Those fortu­
nate enough (perhaps years after grad­
uation) to read eventually of the men 
of genius, Schelle, Priestley, Lavoi­
sier, who had agonized to attain the 
generalization that had seemed so 
tame and valueless to the undergrad­
uate, realized the defectiveness of in­
struction that sought to give the re­
sults of scientific investigation with­
out availing itself of the historical 
motive.
“Another defect in the undergradu­
ate curriculum that might be made 
good by the general history of sci­
ence is the lack of connection between 
scientific studies. In the old-fash­
ioned college the student was per­
mitted to take up biology in the fresh­
man year, physics and chemistry in 
the sophomore, mineralogy and crys­
tallography in the junior, and geol­
ogy, astronomy and psychology in the 
» senior. Scarcely a word in reference 
to the mutual influences and intercon­
nections of these sciences! Only the 
exceptional graduate was able to bring 
order out of the chaos of knowledge 
he bore away with his sheepskin.
Those who attend American insti­
tutions of higher learning might eas­
ily be made to see in the beginnings 
of science essential problems in their 
less complex forms, and realize that 
organized knowledge arose in connec­
tion with industry and human needs. 
They could be placed in a position to 
appreciate the present-day applica­
tions of science, and to welcome fu­
ture inventions and discoveries. At 
the same time they would learn that 
some of the most abstract reasoners 
have contributed to racial progress 
through studies that were not ob­
viously utilitarian. They could be 
made to understand that science is 
the constant pursuit of truth and not 
merely a treasure-house of truth al­
ready attained, and incidentally that 
it is no reproach to science that it 
does not teach today what it taught 
five hundred years ago, and that Dar­
win did not live in vain even if what 
he discovered is also in the process of 
evolution. As already indicated, our 
undergraduates through the example 
of the great scientists should be stim­
ulated to research and independence, 
and weaned from the childlike noti- 
zenstolz of the academic classroom.
Of course in order to be truly cul­
tural a course in the history of the sci­
ences must rise to general ideas, dis­
cuss cause and effect, the constitution
of matter, and the conceptions funda­
mental to all the sciences. In a word 
it must be interpretive and not merely 
narrative. In fact, the subject of study
I am discussing first presented itself 
to my mind as an equivalent in this 
institution of the traditional history 
of philosophy, a means of deepening 
our culture without prejudice to our 
confessed practical, vocational aims. 
It was soon realized that the general 
history of science affords a unique ap­
proach to the history of general 
thought. The history of philosophy 
can be reread in the light of the his­
tory of science.
“The problem of presenting this 
subject adequately would be greatly 
simplified if there were in English a 
good book of four or five hundred 
pages on the Evolution of Scientific 
Thought. Let us add, since we are 
merely expressing a pious wish, that 
it should be a model of concise and 
logical exposition written with the 
charm and lucidity of a Huxley. It 
should rest on a background of gen­
eral ideas, and be a philosophy of the 
sciences; at the same time it should 
not neglect the applications of sci­
ence, and should incite an interest in 
industry and invention.
Some such work is needed by the 
scientific world as a sort of confession 
of faith, or canon of the truth it holds 
and teaches. Without some summary 
of what investigation has demon­
strated the professor has less author­
ity than the clergyman in the minds 
of young men and women. He is held 
in general to be an unbeliever, be­
cause he is negative rather than posi­
tive, destructive rather than con­
structive, a cold critic of what others 
teach rather than an enthusiastic ex­
ponent of the faith he holds. The 
professors fail to express what they 
really think and feel. The mind of 
the learned world has traveled far 
from the agnosticism of the middle 
of the nineteenth century. It is not 
merely that in reference to tradi­
tional faiths scholars do not believe, 
or believe not; they believe some­
thing else. It is too general to say 
that they believe in education and 
enlightenment and simple goodwill. It 
is merely intellectual to proclaim: I 
believe in the law of gravitation, the 
nebular hypothesis, the circulation of 
the blood, the cellular structure of 
the tissues, organic evolution, the 
continuity of germ-plasm, the depend­
ence of human thought on nerve tis- 
use, the evolution of mind, and the 
cure of disease through the develop­
ment of antitoxins. But when hun­
dreds of such truths are presented 
historically as the fixed points in a 
cosmos established by the combined 
efforts of men, the cumulative effect 
is to take us beyond a cold intellec­
tual formation of an ordered universe 
to an enthusiastic affirmation of the 
reign of law to be widened by the 
energies of the generations. More­
over, within its scope come social and 
ethical as well as physical and other 
mental phenomena, and through the 
historical study of ethics and sociol­
ogy the student is led to see the grad­
ual triumph of beneficent customs and 
legislation, supported on principles of 
justice, equity, freedom and good will.
In conclusion one must recognize 
that science is international, English, 
German, French, Italian, Russian, all 
nations co-operating in the interests 
of racial progress. Accordingly, a 
survey of the sciences tends to in­
crease mutual respect, and to heighten 
the humanitarian sentiment. The his­
tory of the sciences can be taught 
to people of all creeds and colors, 
and can not fail to enhance in the 
breast of every young man or woman, 
faith in human progress and good 
will to all mankind.

THE ALVIN.
“The Story of the Rosary,” Walter 
Howard’s romantic melodrama of 
modern war, will be the attraction at 
the Alvin Theater, Pittsburgh, week 
of February 1, with matinees Wed­
nesday and Saturday.
The entire cast and production are 
direct from the Prince's Theater, Lon­
don, and come to Pittsburgh after a 
brilliant and extraordinary successful 
run at the Manhattan Opera House, 
New York.
The scene might be any country of 
continental Europe today. The ac­
coutrements of war are the most mod­
ern and, if one desires to see how 
modern armies look, they need glance 
no farther than to the stirring battle 
scene which is Act II in the Howard 
drama.
More than 100 actors—not super­
numeraries—are seen in the scenes of 
this great war melodrama.
Columbia’s new $1,000,000 gym­
nasium went up in smoke two months 
ago. The authorities immediately set 
about their plans for a new building 
which is to cost $1,200,000. Prelimi­
nary work has already been started. 
Besides the gymnasium, the new 
building will contain two large audi­
toriums, one with a seating capacity 
of 4,000, numerous executive offices 
and rooms for student associations 
and organizations.

APPLIED INDUSTRIES
VISIT OF EVERY-ONCE-IN-A- 
WHILE CLUB.
The Every-Once-in-a-While Club, 
consisting of heads of departments, 
managers, foremen and office men of 
the Pressed Steel Car Company vis­
ited the schools on last Thursday 
evening. There was a party of 75 
men who came from the plant at Mc­
Kees Rocks in special cars. Dean 
Connelley took the men in charge 
upon their arrival.
A dinner was served at the school 
restaurant. This was followed by a 
brief business meeting and then the 
pilgrimage began through the build­
ings. The School of Applied Indus­
tries was the first building visited. 
At the Design School a pleasant sur­
prise was given the men by reason of 
the musical concert which was being 
given at the theater. The men re­
mained for two numbers and were 
delighted with this feature of the 
trip. The Margaret Morrison School 
proved particularly interesting. Mr. 
Russell Smith, president of the club, 
and Mr. H. W. Elverson, of the 
Pressed Steel Car Company, headed 
the party.
One of the objects of the club is 
“The creation of opportunities for its 
members to acquire specific knowledge 
in respect to travel, the sciences, so­
cial, educational, civic and industrial 
problems, and any other subjects 
which may be of interest to the mem­
bers in connection with their work, 
recreation or self-improvement.” Dean 
Connelley addressed the club last 
March and it was upon his invitation 
that the men came out to the schools.
BOY SCOUTS VISIT SCHOOLS.
Troop 47, Boy Scouts, in charge of 
Scoutmaster Edgar F. Heselbarth, 
visited the School of Applied Indus­
tries on last Wednesday evening, as 
guests of Dean Connelley. The Dean 
is a member of the local executive 
committee of the Scouts. Mr. Taylor 
in the Forge Shop gave the boys an 
interesting demonstration of “draw­
ing out” steel, grinding tools, etc., ap­
plying them as object lessons of moral 
significance. In the sheet metal shop, 
Mr. Daugherty took pains to show the 
boys something of the work of his 
department. Typesetting, folding, 
stitching, etc., were shown them in the 
print shop, by Messrs. Farnsworth 
and Leftwich. Mr. Pfouts entertained 
in his lecture room, giving an illus­
trated talk on trees. After the trip 
through the building, the Dean took 
them through a series of scout stunts 
and they left, a happy bunch.
PLEBE SMOKER A SUCCESS
Continued from Page 1 
judges and following the spirited con­
test awarded Parsons and Orr, two 
Upper men, the boxes of stogies, their 
work merited. “Bobbie” Vey and 
“Sox” Price received consolation 
prizes in the form of Prince Albert 
pound-jars.
Moving pictures of the students at 
work closed the evening’s program 
after which dancing followed until an 
early hour.
The success of this pleasant enter­
tainment augurs well for the Plebes 
in school activities. Everything ran 
off smoothly; the plot and jokes were 
the work of Clarence Maguire, the 
chorus being drilled with the assist­
ance of Mr. Price. Expressions from 
all sides were very complimentary in­
deed and we hope the class of 1917 
will continue the pace it has set as 
real live wires.

Practically all the colleges and uni­
versities that have been admitted to 
the Intercollegiate Association of 
Amateur Athletes of America will be 
represented in the first indoor Inter­
collegiate meet, to be held in Madi­
son Square Garden, New York, on 
March 6.
This meet is to be a novel experi­
ment in competitive sport, and if the 
institutions to be made by the com­
mittee prove a success in this affair 
the novelty wTill continue to enliven 
the winter season annually.
Due to the peculiar scoring arrange­
ment and the medley events which 
will feature the program on the first 
occasion of the indoor meeting of the 
Intercollegiate Association, it will be 
impossible to ascertain who is the 
winner of the affair. This indecisive 
ending has been purposely adopted 
because of the desire to encourage the 
smaller colleges.
For a number of years the associa­
tion has been urged to hold an in­
door meeting. It was pointed out by 
the late “Mike” Murphy and other 
great college trainers and coaches 
that training during the winter months 
had come to be regarded as absolu­
tely essential toward the proper de­
velopment of a track team for the 
championship meeting in May. That 
competition was necessary to keep the 
proven athlete keen about his work, 
and interest the novice, and that for 
this competition college teams were 
too dependent on meets held under 
other than college auspices.
It was pointed out that an indoor 
meeting held by the I. C. A. A. A. A. 
would furnish a desirable objective 
point and stimulus for winter prac­
tice, and would make it easier to get 
a large number of men out for track 
earlier in the year.
As finally decided by the commit­
tee in charge, there will be at least 
nine events on the program, at the 
indoor intercollegiate meet on March
6, the first of its kind to be held. 
Three field events—the shot put, high 
jump and pole vault—together, with 
six relays, are definitely scheduled, 
with some other runs still under con­
sideration. The relay races all vary 
in distance, and each will be a con­
test in itself. No points will be scor­
ed toward winning the meet, no tro­
phies will be awarded and no cham­
pionship will be at stake. And each 
event will be conducted in a new and 
unusual manner.
In the shot put, for example, as in 
the other field events, the contesting 
will not be between individuals, but 
among teams of five men from each 
college or university. The scoring in 
this case will be just as in a cross­
country race, first place counting one 
point, second place two points, etc., 
with the low team score being cred­
ited with a win in that event. Thia 
method of scoring will prove an incen­
tive for the second-raters to strive 
for honors, and is welcomed by the 
smaller colleges as a boon to track 
athletics.
The relays are of varying distances, 
with each runner negotiating a differ­
ent number of yards.—The Pennsyl-

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
DESIGN PLEBES INTERCEPT 
SOPHOMORE BANQUET.
Exciting Scrap on Herron Hill.
All plans had been thought fully 
laid for a banquet to be held at the 
Fort Pitt Hotel by the Sophomores of 
the School of Applied Design. The 
class officers of the second year men 
had been notified by Clayton Burnett, 
Sophomore class president, and pro­
spective toastmaster for that evening, 
of their duties as speakers for the 
evening. An outline of speakers had 
been chosen with astute care so as 
to provide an ample supply of wit and 
humor. There were those chosen as 
speakers who were more than capable 
of rendering the wit and pathos of all 
races and nations in an entertaining 
manner. These men were apt in the 
presentation of anecdotes of all ori­
gins, of Chinese humor, German wit, 
or what not.
It was with such expectations in 
view, to say nothing of the feast of the 
evening, that the members of the 
Sophomore class gathered in the 
Dutch Room of the Fort Pitt Hotel on 
Wednesday evening. A short time 
was spent in a handshake among the 
fellows when someone asked, 
“Where’s Burnett? It’s time for the 
banquet, but he has not yet arrived.” 
This was heard by others and seemed 
to send a wave of impatientness over 
the crowd. Just then a bell boy hur­
ried to one of the class officers and 
soon twenty men from the waiting 
crowd left the hotel for a car.
But there is another class of the 
Design School which is worthy of con­
sideration, and by virtue of their 
school spirit and co-operation the 
Plebe class is deserving much praise. 
During the week preceding the sched­
uled date for the Sophomore banquet, 
the members of the Plebe class heard 
of the proposed feast and decided to 
"slip one over” their dictators. A 
meeting was held and in consultation 
with their class president, Jas. L. 
Payne, they decided upon a concerted 
method of action. After the meeting 
had been in progress for some time, 
a unanimous vote was taken whereby 
Mr. Burnett, the Sophomore class 
president was to be “kidnaped” the 
night of the banquet and detained with 
other class officers from that gather­
ing. To be brief, Wednesday 
evening found some nineteen (19) 
Plebes guarding the Sigma Rho fra­
ternities house at 3400 Iowa street, in 
which, Burnett and others were cap­
tives. Another hour found the fel­
lows who had left the hotel to come 
to the rescue of their president and 
offices; nearing the house, and before 
long a general mix-up between the 
“Sophs” and “Plebes” was under way.
This, however, lasted only a short 
time and 10:30 P. M. found the officers 
and members of the second year class 
at the banquet, feasting and at peace. 
Mr. Payne, who was taken to the ban­
quet as a captive and trophy of the 
fight, was called upon to speak and 
after a pleasing talk of several min­
utes closed by stating that he was 
glad to be with them although such 
had not been his plans. He expressed 
keen delight in the royal manner in 
which he had been treated at the ban­
quet, and his remarks were astute and 
appropriate; disregarding the fact that 
the official Sophomore barber was 
staring him in the face and fingering 
a much used pair of hair clippers.
It is more than a credit to the Soph­
omore class that they showed so acute 
an appreciation of the “good fellow” 
spirit toward Mr. Payne, who repre­
sents the Plebe class; and it is just 
such an attitude that will make the 
Carnegie Institute a place of pleasure 
for its members and an institution of 
real brotherhood.
Mr. Burnett opened the banquet 
with a snappy talk, concluding by 
saying:
“We will have to hand it to Payne 
and his fellows for starting what they 
did. They put up a mighty good ef­
fort but no one yet has ever got ahead 
of the class of ’17 nor has any class 
as yet equalled the ’17 boys. Payne 
came out the little end of the horn 
this time, but anyway, fellows, we are 
glad to have him with us and his class 
should be proud of him.”
Among the speakers of the evening 
were, Mr. Burnett, Mr. Payne, Mr. 
Stryker, Mr. Boss, Mr. Handloser, Mr. 
Beckman, Mr. Barker, Mr. Weiss, Mr. 
Dornberger, Mr. Kornman, Mr. 
Voyce, Mr. Spackmari, Mr. Malier, 
Mr. Anderson.
CLASS B SPECIAL ESQUISSE.
A new subject was introduced in the 
Department of Architecture, a special 
esquisse, five hours long. The sub­
ject was a “Hotel for a Small City.” 
Prizes were given, the first being a 
year’s subscription to the Bulletin of 
the American Institute of Architects. 
M. E. Boyer won the competition, 
“Solgaz” Anderson took second place. 
It is going to be a custom to have 
such esquisses in the future. The 
trial proved a great success and has 
taken favor among the students.
Rice L'niversity at Houston, Texas, 
is remarkable in more than one way. 
This is but the second year of its ex­
istence and yet its endowment is $10,-
000,000. This year there are three 
times as many instructors and four 
times as many students at last year. 
A high standard of entrance require­
ments was set up at the establishment 
of the university, and this year more 
than 200 students were turned away 
on account of incomplete preparation.
The Illini celebrated “Illinois Day,” 
the birthday of the State, with be­
coming rites, on December 3. Vice 
President David Kinley laid the cor­
ner stone of the new commerce build­
ing, and President James addressed a 
huge convocation of the students as a 
closing event. The day was also fea­
tured by the reviewing by Governor 
Edward Dunne of the Illinois Cadets, 
who formed a half-mile parade.

INTERCOLLEGIATE NOTES.
One out of every two students at 
the University of Chicago earns his 
own way through college.
Vice-president Marshall is to ad­
dress the students of the University 
of West Virginia on December 21st.
At Yale but 38 men are allowed to 
wear the Y, 14 being football men,
11 of whom graduate this year. No 
man has won his letter in more than 
one major sport.
The basketball reserves at Roches­
ter have secured 12 games for their 
season.
Lehigh, Princeton and Yale have 
all erected great new athletic stadi­
ums this year.
As the result of a law recently 
adopted in the state of Michigan to 
the effect that it shall be a criminal 
act to carry a red flag, Harvard stu­
dents were not permitted to display 
their college pennants. The law while 
aimed at the Socialists hit the stu­
dents as well.
Dr. A. R. Taylor, former president 
of the Kansas State Normal, has fig­
ured out on the basis of efficiency 
that college education is worth $200 
per day.
W. and J. has a new president, Dr. 
Hinett, formerly of Central Univer­
sity, Danville, Ky.
At W. and J. the Freshmen are now 
allowed to live in the fraternity 
houses. For some time this has not 
been allowed. A short time ago, how­
ever, a committee of the faculty car­
ried on an investigation which pro­
duced results extremely favorable to 
the fraternities. It was found that 
the men living in the fraternity houses 
ranked higher in their studies than 
the men living outside of the houses.
It is quite evident from the follow­
ing quotation from the “Wooster 
Voice” that Wooster is making every 
effort to turn out winning teams for 
the triangular debate this year. “The

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
SCIENCE STUDENTS HEAR LEC­
TURE ON THE UNDER­
WORLD.
On Wednesday January 20, the stu­
dents received the last lecture of the 
semester, and were given a talk that 
should lead many to think and pon­
der over the speaker’s words.
The speaker is an authority on mu­
nicipal affairs and Dean Leete said 
that no one could do better justice to 
the subject of the “Relation of muni­
cipal government to the underworld,” 
than Mr. Wallace.
The idea was very prevalent that 
the privilege of voting had been given 
to many who did not know how to 
use it, and who are kept down in ig­
norant, however, after twenty years 
experience Mr. Wallace declares that 
this country has nothing to fear from 
this force of submerged men.”
“The sole problem of these people 
is to keep themselves and their fami­
lies alive. They have all they want 
to attend to without looking out­
side for trouble.”
How the working of political forces 
is the same as the working of natural 
forces. It is a self evident fact that 
these men can not wield as much 
power or bring as much pressure to 
bear, as the president of a large rail­
road. It is a fiction and utterably 
absurd to think that they have the 
same force in politics.
“Why,” said Mr. Wallace, “I could 
name twenty men in the City of Pitts­
burgh, who could carry any election 
held here.”
This mass of down-trodden men 
has the same constituency as any 
other mass. Their impulses are in 
the same direction, their feelings are 
the same as any one else’s. It is not 
because they want to go into corrup­
tion but because he is driven to it, 
that he is submerged.
As an example of this corrupt con­
trol, take the administration of the 
police laws. In a particular city, you 
can go to any foreigner and ask him 
where to go in case he gets in trouble. 
He will tell you the name of the man, 
generally a saloon keeper, who has 
great .influence with the magistrate.
The foreigner soon learns that if he 
wants to be free, if he wants to con­
duct his business freely, he must have 
the “entree” to the right man, who 
can say the right word.
Who is responsible for this organi­
zation of corruption? The old idea, 
was that it was created by the under­
world. But don’t believe any power 
of the underworld had anything to do 
with this. When a man is told that 
if a certain party is not elected mayor 
at the next election, he will lose his 
job, the man will get a move on to see 
that the orders are carried out. This 
brings pressure to bear on people and 
crushes them.
There is no corruption in german 
municipal politics because there is no 
need for it. The system of having the 
people who pay one-third of all tjie 
taxes elect one-third of all the council, 
and the people who pay the next one-
third elect another third of the coun­
cil, brings the rule of the city in the 
hands of five per cent of the voters. 
However, there must be a fiction of 
a popular election.
The organization of the under­
world and its actions is carried on by 
the orders and directions of those 
“higher up”. The funds are secured 
by means of levying on business peo­
ple. Any attempt to strike at the 
heart of the underworld, makes those 
at the top quiver and shake.
It behooves us then to take an atti­
tude of sympathy for the victims, to 
follow it up, take the time to learn 
about it. For when the people come 
to know these conditions they will 
help to stop this business.

How to render gasoline fumes prac­
tically harmless is one of the great 
problems today, when gasoline cars 
and engines for all kinds of uses are 
spitting out vast quantities of exhaust 
gas. There is good reason to hope 
that a practical remedy will be found 
before long. Already one partial cure 
has been discovered.
In blasting out the great Mount 
Royal Tunnel, at Montreal the rail­
road engineers thought they had 
found a remedy for gasoline fumes 
that would make possible the use 
of gasoline engines for hauling 
out rock as the tunnel heading 
advanced. The deadly feature of gaso­
line exhaust fumes is carbon-monox- 
ide gas. A very little of this is dan­
gerous. One cubic foot of carbon- 
monoxide gas in a thousand cubic feet 
of air is very serious.
The exhaust contains a consider­
able proportion of this deadly gas. 
The exhaust also has a large percent­
age of carbon-dioxide gas, which is 
comparatively harmless. The most 
dangerous thing about carbon-dioxide 
gas is that its presence in unduly large 
quantities means that the air is low 
in oxygen and so may not have suffi­
cient for safety.
Accordingly the engineers of the 
tunnel tried to turn the carbon-monox- 
ide gas into the comparatively safe 
carbon-dioxide gas by passing the ex­
haust over lime. Their scheme was 
sound theoretically, but did not work 
completely. Part of the harmful gas 
was made harmless, but part still re­
mained in its natural condition.
As a result the engineers gave up 
the use of gasoline engines in such 
close quarters. Nevertheless, their 
idea is being studied; and there is hope 
that by some method along this line 
success may be obtained.
Experiments by the United States 
Bureau of Mines have recently shown 
that it is possible to figure out exact­
ly the conditions under which a gaso­
line engine may be operated safely 
in a confined space, such as a mine.
A system has been discovered by 
which any engineer can tell how much 
carbon monoxide any particular en­
gine is likely to puff out under bad 
conditions; and then, by figuring the 
amount of air in the confined space 
and the amount of fresh air coming 
in, the engineer can determine wheth­
er a given gasoline engine can be
Scheme Provides for Alumnus Treas­
urer Who Will Manage Un­
dergraduates’ Activities.
HE WILL PAY ALL BILLS
Debts Cannot Be Contracted by Col­
lege Organization Until 
Sanctioned by Him.
iNew York University students, in 
an attempt to solve a serious college 
problem, have adopted a plan call­
ing for the appointment of a bonded 
Treasurer who shall have full control 
over all finances connected with col­
lege activities except those pertain­
ing to athletics or fraternities.
The system calls for the appoint­
ment of an alumnus Treasurer with 
an undergraduate assistant who shall 
have full power to pay bills and to 
forbid the incurring of debts. Once 
the Treasurer’s sanction is given pay­
ment of any bill contracted by any un­
dergraduate organization will be guar­
anteed by the university. The Treas­
urer will be under $4,000 bond.
The new system, the idea of Dr. 
Theodore F. Jones, a member of the 
Faculty, was submitted to the stu­
dents for their approval and was 
passed practically unanimously. There 
is little doubt that it will be gladly 
welcomed by the Faculty. The failure 
of student publications has been com­
mon in many institutions, and this to­
gether with frequent non-payment of 
bills contracted through the holding 
of a college dinner or the damage 
done to some restaurant during the 
breaking up of a freshman affair by 
sophomores has done a great deal to 
discredit the college itself. It is to 
counteract the idea of unreliability 
that the change is to be adopted.
The alumnus Treasurer will prob­
ably be appointed by the Faculty and 
the choice ratified by the student 
body. His assistant will be elected by 
the students. In addition to the bond­
ed Treasurer the students have pass­
ed a motion petitioning the Faculty 
to make compulsory the payment of 
a blanket tax of $5 at the beginning 
of the school year which will cover 
a subscription of The New Yorker.

lege publications and also leave

The students in their weekly meet­
ing voted for the measure by approxi­
mately three to one. They wish to 
have the Faculty collect the money 
and disburse the funds through the 
medium of the Treasurer. If the Fac­
ulty pass the plan there will be about 
$3,000 available yearly. Advertise­
ments in the college publications will 
probably double that amount.
The change will stop the leaving of 
unpaid bills by graduating classes, and 
is believed to be a forward step in the 
development of American undergrad­
uate college life. While not taking 
away from students the absolute con­
trol of undergraduate activities, the 
new system will place them on a busi­
ness basis.—Exchange.
Syracuse University is constructing 
a new $250,000 forestry building and 
a $100,000 law building.
Michigan is putting up a new sci­
ence building which is to cost $375,-

on the campus.
The largest law library in the coun­
try is located at Harvard. The Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania ranks third 
in size; Yale’s is seventh.
A statue to Noah Webster, the great 
lexicographer, has been erected at 
Amherst. Webster was the president 
of the first board of trustees of that

HOW ARE YOU EDUCATED?
The following from the Ohio State 
Lantern, we think is pretty good and 
to the point:
“A professor in the University of 
Chicago recently told his students he 
could consider them educated in the 
best sense of the word when they 
could say yes to every one of the 
questions that he should put io them. 
The following \^erfc the questions that 
he desired them to be able to answer 
in the affirmative:
“Has education given you sympathy 
with all the good causes that made 
you espouse them?
“Has it made you public-spirited?
“Has it made you a brother to the 
weak?
“Have you learned how to make 
friends and keep them
“Do you know what it is to be a 
friend yourself?
“Can you look an honest man or 
a pure woman in the eye?
“Do you see anything to love in 
a little child?
"Will a lonely dog follow you in 
the street?
“Can you be high-minded and hap­
py in the meanest drudgeries of life?
“Do you thing washing dishes and 
hoeing corn just as compatible with 
high thinking as piano playing or 
golf?
‘Are you good for anything your­
self?
“Can you be happy alone?
“Can you look out on the world 
and see anything but dollars and 
cents?
“Can you look into a mud puddle 
by the wayside and see a clear sky?
“Can you see anything in the pud­
dle but mud?
“Can you look into the sky at night 
and see beyond the stars?
“Cut out this editorial and pin it 
up before your lamp. Look at it 
often, read the above questions and 
ponder over them. There is a world 
of philosophy and of serious thinking 
connected with every question that 
this professor asked. Can you say 
“yes” to any or all of the questions? 
Take another look at the last five 
questions! How about the next to 
the last one? Do you see anything 
to love in little children?
Can you look an honest man or 
a pure woman in the eyes? Are you 
good for anything yourself, espe­
cially anything that is for brotherly 
or sisterly love? Now think it over, 
are you educated?
JOURNALISM DISCUSSED BY 
S. S. McCLURE.
“In the first place the purpose of 
all writing is to convince or to amuse 
somebody. There are certain funda­
mental qualities which an editor 
should always keep in mind. The 
first and greatest of these is accur­
acy—accuracy of fact and accuracy 
in color. It is all important, and 
should be the sole aim of editors, al­
ways to seek the whole truth. In­
sight, power to differentiate and 
grasp of details are the pre-requisites 
for the realization of such an aim. 
Every successful editor must possess 
them.
