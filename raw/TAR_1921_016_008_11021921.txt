NOTICE! TECH SPECIAL
TO PENN STATE
FIRST ISSUE NOV. 15
The new Carnegie Technical Jour­
nal will be out on November 15, 
"New?’' Yes, in more ways than one; 
new size, new type, better articles.
This year’s Technical Journal will 
appear in its new size, the sdjme as 
all the leading technical papers m 
the . country. The cover will be 
pleasing, both as to design and ma­
terial. A short summary of the con­
tents will appear here as a sample 
of what is to icome inside.
You all know how hard it was to 
read the old . small type last year. 
There will be no such trouble this 
year; the type is much larger and 
clearer. Two columns also; it’ll 
make a nifty appearance. ’ And don’t 
forget we now have the best printer 
in town on the job and he promises 
ua some results that have never 
been obtained at Tech.
The policy this year will be to 
give everyone his money’s worth. 
The articles are going to be wort;h 
while. Some of them are to be writ­
ten by successful men of the busi­
ness world, men who have made 
themselves big by their own work. 
They are to tell us about it. A little 
encouragement in this line will do 
all of us a world of good. Then 
comes a series of articles1 on the 
iwork of an engineer after gradua­
tion, all written by authorities in the 
various fields.
How often we say, when the ques­
tion of what we are going to be is 
put to us, “Why I’m going to be an 
electrical or mechanical or com­
mercial engineer.” Nowadays that 
means little or nothing. This is the 
day of specialization. Not the me­
chanical engineer but the design en­
gineer who it is true is a mechanic­
al engineer but must be a specialist in 
design or machinery. Or again he 
may be a combustion engineer or a 
sales engineer, for the man who sells 
large machinery must be primarily 
an engineer -so as to sell intelligent­
ly. So, also may the other branches 
be divided up. But what is a combus­
tion engineer? That is the reason 
that these articles have been^ pre-

PENN STATE “Y” TO 
FEED TECH ROOTERS
•Mr.' Davis of the Tech branch of 
the Y. M. C. A. has been busy try­
ing to make arrangements with the 
Y. M. C. A. branch at Penn State, 
so as to have the Tech rooters fed 
upon their arrival at the State Col­
lege.
This co-operation of xhe Y’s or 
the schools will solve the problem 
of meals for the many that travel 
via the Penn State sipecial, as the 
delegation would overtax the res­
taurant capacity of the State Col­
lege if no provision were made for 
them.
Y. M. C. A.
Tonight another one of the Y. M. 
•C. A. swims "will be held. Come out 
and join the group and have a real 
jolly time. Sixty-four men came out 
last Wednesday but the tank is large 
.and thete is room for lots more.
Instruction will be given those 
that cannot swim. The time is 7 
to 8 o’clock tonight (Wednesday) 
November 2, at the Schenley High 
School. Meet at 6:30 at the Y. M.
C. A. Office, Room 124, Industries.
The discussion groups have, finally 
gotten into full sway. Professor 
Simpson of the College or Engineer­
ing is giving a series of talks on 
ancient manuscripts, which are brief, 
averaging a half hour each, and 
are given every Wednesday at the 
hour of 12 in Room 124-A Indus­
tries—the Y. M. C. A. club room. 
Professor Simpson has made the 
study of ancient manuscripts his hob­
by and has spent consierdable time 
in their study at the University of 
Chicago.
On Friday evening, at 7:30, the 
Plebes have a discussion group un­
der the charge of Al. Mays. They 
meet in Room 124-A Industries. The 
course of discussion has not been 
fully outlined but most likely will 
be a study of the “Student’s Stand­
ards of Action.” Everyone urged to 
come out to Professor Simpson's 
group and all Plebes are urged to 
come out Fridays, as the talks will 
be worth listening to.
The Y. M. C. A. cluibroom is a 
quiet pleasant place to study and 
solve some of those ’problems that 
cause worries. You won't find the 
noise and bustle that is so common 
in most of the 'club rooms on the 
campus. For real study during your 
spare foments, make use of the 
Room 124-A, Inudstries.
All students who are going to 
Penn State on the Tech Special 
should leave their name with the 
grauate manager, Frank Haaren, im­
mediately. This is necessary to en­
able the athletio authorities to make 
arrangements with the railroad com­
pany.

R.C. ROLL CALL 
THIS MONTH
Annual National Membership 
Drive to be Held in 
November
Great enthusiasm is being shown 
in this district by those who will con­
duct the fifth roll call of the Pitts­
burgh -Chapter of the American Red 
Cross Zero Hour, Sunday, November 
13, in the formation of an organiza­
tion to enroll as many adults as 
possible in the interest of “Greatest 
mother in the world.”
The American Red Cross plans to 
spend $25,000,000 for the year ending 
June 30 next because the demands 
being made upon the organization’s 
resources require that sum and it 
must be remembered that the Red 
Cross, while its efforts arc voluntary, 
is an integral part of the United 
States Government. The Red Cross 
is- an organization “In the service 
of those who suffer” and its outstand­
ing message at this time is, “I am the 
Red Cross of Peace; I heal the 
wounds of war; I am a refuge from 
fire, flood and pestilence, the love 
of little children is mine, I am the 
Red Cross of Peace.”
One of the largest activities of 
the Pittsburgh Chapter comes' under 
the direction of the Home Service 
Section in the giving of aid to dis­
abled soldiers and their dependents 
with nearly 7,000 active cases now 
Ibeing provided -for- in this, county; 
Of the 2,200 ex-service men taking 
training under the Federal Board for 
Vocational training in the Allegheny 
institutions, virtually all have been 
or are being assisted by the Red 
Cross.
The Pittsburgh Chapter makes 
loans through the Home Service Sec­
tion to trainees pending the arrival 
of their first pay, also when emergen 
cies arise during their training course. 
These are usually paid back on the 
arrival of their first pay check and 
where sickness in the family occurs, 
the chapter does not require it. The 
vast majority of soldiers resent any 
imputation of accepting what some 
might think was charity and insist 
upon paying back these loans. At 
the ¡present time the. chapter is 
spending nearly $25,000 a month to 
help the disabled service men or his 
dependents.
SENIOR WATCH CHAIN
The Committee on Distinctive 
Dress for the Senior has recommend­
ed that a one-lialf inch plaid ribbon 
be worn on the vest in place of a 
watch chain. On the ribbon there 
will be a square gold runner with a 
large “C” on it. The Senior class 
has voted favorably on the recom­
mendation and) steps are being taken 
now to find where the best prices can 
be had. It is probably only a mat­
ter of a short- time until the plaid 
ribbon will have become as much a 
part of the school as the Plebe cap.
For the past few years the Senior 
classes have . felt the need of 
some fitting and proper way of dis­
tinguishing themselves from the men 
of the other classes but through lack 
of co-operation on the part of the 
Seniors themselves they have failed 
to obtain any results.
However, this year’? class imme­
diately went to work and probably 
have established a tradition at Tech.
The committee lias also recom­
mended that the Senior girls wear 
plaid bands for their wrist watches 
but the girls have not voted on the 
recommendation so far as it is un­
certain what will be done.
To Take Orders Soon For 
Holiday Trade—Arts Stud­
ents to Make Designs
MUST RAISE $2,000
A campaign for the sale of Christ­
mas cards is to be held soon by the 
Graphica in order to. raise money 
for the inspection trip which is to 
be taken during Easter vacation. »
The greeting icards will be printed 
and sold entirely by the students in 
the printing department. Professor 
Hoyle, honorary member of the 
Graphica, has given his consent to 
the campaign and trip and declared 
that all printing students including 
the Freshmen, should go. All mem­
bers who attended the Graphica 
meeting Friday, October 28, express­
ed their personal intention to work 
on the Christmas card campaign.
Thirty-five dollars in prizes have 
been offered by the Graphica to the 
Arts College students who submit 
the four best designs suitable for 
these cards. Fifteen dollars will be 
given for the best one, ten dollars 
for the second best and five dollars 
apiece for 1 lie third and fourth de­
signs The designs are to be printed 
in three colors. Names will be im­
printed upon the cards on request, 
and personal cards \yill be sold.
The campaign to get orders will 
start about the middie of November, 
and the cards will be ready for dis­
tribution sometime before Christmas
The Graphica will need over $2,000 
for the inspection trilp1, and to secure 
this amount, it ds estimated that 
each member' will have to sell 50 
dozen Christmas cards.
R. u. A. BUG? JOIN 
THE RADIO CLUB
A very short and snappy meeting 
of the Carnegie Tech Radio Club was 
held Wednesday, October 19, at which 
a iarge number of old and new mem­
bers were present.
The minutes of the preceding meet­
ing were read and approved. The en­
tertainment committee then gave a 
report on its progress in arrange­
ments for the Radio Club dance to be 
held in the very near future. Several 
novel features were discussed in con­
nection with the program for this 
event. Music is to be supplied both 
by a good orchestra, as well as by 
radio. Other details cannot be made 
public at this time.
, Another meeting was held Wed­
nesday, October 26. at 7:30 p. m., in 
the Machinery Hall Tower, Radio 
Room. Professor Work gave a short 
address, which was of interest to 
all the toluib members and others 
present.
Some students at the school have a 
wrong impression as to the require­
ments for joining the Radio Club.
All that is necessary to become a 
member is that you are interested in 
the radio art. You do not have to 
know the code or be a licensed op­
erator, but if you are anxious to learn 
the code and the principles underly­
ing the radio 'commlunication; you 
may acquire this knowledge by at­
tending classes in this work, for 
which there are no fees. So all you 
need to do is to join the ranks and 
help keep things moving.
HAVE YOU ANY SNAPSHOTS?
THE THISTLE NEEDS THEM
The Thistle is an need of some 
snapshots of last, spring’s baseball 
and tennis team^. Action pictures 
are preferable. If you have any you 
think we could :ise, put them in an 
envelope, with your name on the 
outside and leave them at the post 
office in care of the Thistle. Either 
the print or the negative will do.
NEW PLAY IN 
ARTS THEATER
Performances of Pinero’s 
“The Thunderbolt" All 
This Week
“The Thunderbolt,” which -will 
have its first performance tonight, 
promises to be one of the most in­
teresting productions seen in the 
Arts Theater in a long time. The 
story is tensely dramutiic, and holds 
the interest to the end. The char­
acter drawing is .sure and definite, 
Pinero at his best. The settings, al­
though all modern, and by no means 
spectacular, are new and excellently 
designed. They have been executed 
with much care, as much credit lin­
ing due to David Gaither for this 
phase of the work as is assuredly 
earned by Alexander Wyckoff in tha 
designing. The direction of Chester 
Wallace has been minute and pains­
taking—just the sort of care being 
taken with the details of the com­
plex situations with which the play 
abounds as is necessary to rnaka 
the performance a smooth and finish- 
ed one in ¿^very respect.
Performances will be given ever)' 
night this week, and during the lat­
ter half of the week following. The 
cast is as follows:

CROSS-COUNTRY MEN MEET STATE-PENN
COAL MINING 
RESEARCH
On November 5, Tech students will be pouring into State College by 
every conceivable method from “foot-power" to “steam-power.” having in­
cluded between said terminals, such powers as “Horse,” "Will,” "Bumming,” 
and so forth. In short, tliero will be no stopping tho "got there” idea of the 
followers of the Plaid griddors. If they have money, it will bo by "steam- 
power;” if tho ownership of pecuniary means is most conspicuous by its 
absence, almost any one of tho above named "powers” will ho utilized.
It does behoove every loyal Tochito to dig deep down into his "jeans” 
and make an honest effort to rake together that required $14.00 and ride on 
tho Tech Spocial for Penn State. Other trips have boon had, but in com­
parison to THIS trip, all others wore merely trips, that’s all. This is THE 
trip of ALL trips—the trip of tho year on which moro fun will bo had than
o—<*:«on all the others that have gone be­
fore put together. WHY? It is all 
very simple! What is November 
5th? To mo avorage Techite, it rep­
resents only the date upon which 
Tech moots Penn State In football. 
That is to say, that is all said date 
moans up ’till now, but after roading 
this article, Novombor 5th will take 
on a now moaning. Novombor 5th is 
PENNSYLVANIA DAY at Pennsylva­
nia State College! And what is Penn­
sylvania Day? It is no moro, nor no 
loss than tho blggost day in tho schol­
astic year of Penn State. It corre­
sponds to Campus Week of Carnoglo 
Tocli. "Nuf Sod!” On that day, all 
Ponn Stato alumni 'return to tholr Al­
ma Mator for a visit. So, it doos bo- 
hoovo tho student body up thoro at 
STATE to got busy and proparo a 
program that will satisfy the appotlto 
of old “Grads” for a good tlmo. How 
do thoy do this? By bringing a groat 
football team tlioro for them to gaze 
upon as thoy stack up against tho 
Mount Nittany Lion. By arranging 
for a cross-country moot botwoon tho 
Ponn Stato Harriot's and tho groat- 
ost cross-country team In tl»*; country. 
And right thoro in whore Carnoglo 
Tocli comes In. Tho Carnoglo Toch 
iootbrvU toam Jy thy town that Juts 
boon honorod in this mannoi\ Tho 
Carnoglo Tacit cross-country toam is 
tho recipient, of tho co-honor. For­
sooth, It. doth soom ns If Pennsylvania 
Day moans just us much to Carnoglo 
Toch as It does to Ponn Stato.
So, Tpoli has sot an a slogan: "To 
Stato To Win.” Wo may NOT’ win, 
but wo’ro going thoro to do that stunt, 
anyway. In ot.hor words, tho football 
toam will bo primed to give tho game 
of tholr life, and before tho battlo- 
olouds have subsided tho Mount Nlt­
tany Lion will have realized that thoy 
thoy have had a gamo of football. In­
cidentally tho gamo will bo a "whalo 
of a gamo.” This moans that tho 
gamo will bo without a doubl. a gamo 
well worth Booing, with plenty ol! 
thrills to satisfy tho most exacting 
football critic, and thoro Is no doubt 
hut that such will bo the case, for it 
Is just undor such conditions that tho 
Carnoglo Toch team la known to put 
forth its groatost fight. For Instance, 
ploaso noto tho results of past games 
with great teams.
Tho Toch Spocial for Ponn Stato 
will loavo tho Pennsylvania Station, 
down town, at 7:80 a. in., and will ar­
rive in Lomont, Ponna., at about 1:30 
j). m., giving tho crowd about one 
hour to cover tho two miles from ’Lo­
mont to State College before tho 
game starts. The round trip faro will 
bo $14.00. The ticket for tho game 
will bo $1.50, making a grand total of 
$15.50 for the trip.

SCIENCE SOPHS
CHASTISE PLEBES
Were Hamlet a Plebe he might have 
said:
“To be or not to be—that is the ques­
tion,
Whether 'tls nobler in the mind to 
suffer
The pangs and sorrows of a Tech 
Plebe
Or to take arms against a sea of 
Sophs
And by struggling overcome them.”
Plebes whose minds ran along the 
above channel undoubtedly came to a 
hasty decision in • the matter at 
Science Assembly last week, after 
witnessing tho inevitable result of 
"taking arms” against tho Sopho­
mores and Plebe regulations In gen­
eral.
A generous amount of paint was 
dispensed with On tho fiucos of Plebes 
who apparently thought It matterod 
not whether tholr socks wore green 
or not, whether thoy used Room 01 or 
not, or whether (.hoy regarded Sopho 
mores as tholr superiors and troatod 
them as such. At any rate tho cam­
pus boasted of a now species after 
the Sophomores had exercised tholr 
artistic abilities and moro than one 
who saw the victims gives Darwin 
credit for the truth of his theory. 
The sight of running tho gauntlet 
and taking part in a peanut race at 
the same time certainly affords a 
source of pleasure to the upperclass­
men, but to the Plebe a source of 
mortification and pain.
MECH. DEPT. INSPECTS
CARNEGIE STEEL CO.
Students who are taking the steel 
works option of tho mechanical de­
partment had an extremely interest­
ing visit to the Edgar Thompson 
works of the Carnegie Steel Com- ¦ 
pany the past week. Mr. C. R. Hen­
derson, a former student of the col­
lege took charge of the group.
The students were first shown 
the charging bins. In this plant the 
bins represent the'best current prac­
tice. Next a blast furnace in opera­
tion was visited and tho pouring 
noticed. After this tho skeleton or 
steel frame of a furnace was Inspect­
ed. From where tho students wore 
led to a furnace which was being re- 
lined.
II; Is not yory ofton that tho entire 
construction of a furnasco can be seen 
in one visit as occurred at this par­
ticular time, For tho abovo roason 
tho details were noticed, thus help­
ing those who arc working on tho de­
sign of such equipment.
Tho mechanical department has 
started a now practlco which prom­
ises to link the thoorotlcal knowledge 
of tho Senior with tho work of tho 
other classes. The Sonlors of the* 
Power section are designing a mod­
ern steam onglno. Working from tho 
general layout tho Plebes will malco 
the detail drawings. Tho Sophomoro 
and Junior classes will take the de­
tail drawings into tiio shops and 
build the engine. After tho engine is 
built, the Seniors will test the en­
gine in the median.!cad laboratory 
thereby comparing the theoretical 
calculations with the actual results.

TO STATE TO WIN
Our slogan, for the Penn State game, Saturday, is “To State to 
Win.” It is unlike other slogans, because it implies more; we are 
going to Penn »State for one purpose alone, TO "WIN.
The members of the football team are determined to bring vic­
tory home. Whether they arc able to accomplish this feat may seem 
doubtful, but the student body believes and says “To State TO 
WIN.”
Now, to every loyal son of the Plaid and to every beloved Mag­
gie Murpli—back your team to the limit. It will be a memorable 
game, the like of which you may never have the chance to see again.
Besides it’s Pennsylvania Day, next Saturday, at Penn State. 
This is the «day of reunion for Penn State’s alumni, it is one of the 
feature days on Penn State’s ehlendar. We, the student body, must 
mate a creditable showing. Georgia Tech brought a train load of 
rooters ,to New York from Atlanta and Pitt took about 1,000 over 
to Philadelphia last Saturday. We hold the reputation of having 
a little bit more school spirit than the rest oil the colleges in this 
section of the country, so let us uphold it. Get, to Penn State, Sat­
urday, somehow. It doesn’t matter much how you get there, but be 
there.

unini who will no doubt wish to at­
tend tho Pennsylvania Day célébra­
tions at their Alma Mater. This spe­
cial will bo tho one ideal way to go to 
Stato College on Saturday morning. 
There will bo no doubt many alumni 
of Stato who will be only able to get 
off from work on Saturday. Tech stu­
dents will welcome you, Penn State 
alumni, to make use of this special 
both going and returning. The re­
turn trip will bo started about two 
hours after tho end of the game. This 
special will be the only way to return 
to Pittsburgh before Sunday night, 
and as conditions will bo overcrowded 
in State College, hotel accommoda­
tions and boarding house accommoda­
tions will be taxed to the limit, the 
special is the one ideal way to return 
to Pittsburgh. So, if you wish to 
make use of the Tech Special, let 
your desires be known to Graduate 
Manager I-Iaaren, and he will gladly 
fix you up, and also give any further 
information that Is desired.
As to the game, in running against 
Ponn State, Carnegie Tech will moot 
tho strongest team in the country, a 
team that has hold Harvard to a 21-21 
tie. dofoatod Goorgia Tech 2S-7, and 
Lolilgli 28-7. Aside from this thoy 
luivo won from Lebanon Valley, 
Gettysburg, North Carolina State by 
improsslvo scores. So, it is plainly 
soon that the Tech grlddors are moot- j 
fug a fee that will tax tholr utmost 
ability to oven keep down tho score, 
not to montton getting away with a 
victory. As said before, Toch is tak­
ing the greatest, toam In her history 
to Stato College; a team that will bo 
fully cognizant of Its task; and there­
fore a team that will ho primed to 
play the game of their life.
There seems to be no way to com­
pare the teams with but one excep­
tion, and that is tho Lehigli game. 
Wash-Jeff defeated Lehigh 1*1-0.
Wash-.Teff defeated Tech 14-0. Making 
Lehigli one touchdown hotter than 
Tech. Penn State defeated Lehigh 
2S-7, giving Penn State a margin "of 
four touchdowns over Tech. But com­
parative scores are not worth much, 
so use your own judgment.
About the only way to look at the 
outcome of the game is to predict a 
great game, and one that will be most

ARTS ASSEMBLY
The regular assembly of the Divi­
sion of the Arts was held on last 
Wednesday in the Little Theater. Mr. 
Krump, president of the Alumni As­
sociation, was present and spoke rel­
ative to the co-operation necessary 
botween tho alumni association nnd 
the student body of Tech. Ho stated 
that It would bo of great asistanco 
to tho hlumni association if tho stu­
dent body at Arts would take somo 
action whereby only graduates who 
wore members of the alumni associa­
tion could attend various functions 
held In the school—the Art students' 
ball bolng chief amongst those. Ho 
also said that his organization wished 
to help tho 'undergraduates in every 
way possible. He strongly Urged any 
student to come to him personally In 
case of real need.
Dean Bossange pointed out the ad­
visability of backing up the associa­
tion in every possible way. He stated 
that In his personal inlerveiws with 
entering students an invariable ques­
tion is* "Why did you come to Tech?’' 
and nine-tenths of the answers show 
that it was not through the publica­
tions or various other activities, but 
'because of the information of some 
former student, which proves what a 
wonderful factor the alumni associa­
tion is in building up the Institute. 
In years to come, it is they who will 
be the trustees oi! the Institution 
which will mean stiil greater co-op­
eration between students and alumni.
Tho Dean then put before the as­
sembly the two points which yearly 
cause tho most discussion regarding 
the ball—the date and the type of the 
ball. I-Ie showed whereby a fixed 
date would’ add prestige to the affair 
and mentioned the European custom 
of having tho biggest celebration on 
tho eve of Lent or the doy before 
Ash Wednesday. This year that date 
would bo especially attractive, coming 
as it does, on the eve of a school holi­
day—Washington’s Birthday. He said 
that the faculty ore in favor of a 
period hall, though they would only 
suggest, the choice being lert to the 
student body entirely. He suggested 
a Roman ball similar to the one held 
soven or eight years ago, an advant­
age of a ball of this typo being that 
the architecture of the Arts building 
is porfectly adaptable to It.
Turkish and Spanish types were 
also suggested.
PHYSICS CULLUUUIUM
At tho .mooting, of tho Physics

SENIOR-JUNIOR DANCE
One of tho prettiest dances of the 
Hallowe'en season was staged Friday 
night in tho Recreation Hall of' Mar­
garet Morrison College, given to tho 
Juniors by the Seniors of that col­
lege.
The hall was decorated with largo 
orange lights from which hung fes­
toons of colored serpentine and au­
tumn leaves. ^
The music put just tho right 
iimouut of pep into the danco and the 
hall was a scene, of “frivolous frolic.”
Miss Pope, the newly elected spon­
sor of the Senior class, was an ideal 
chaperon, as were Miss Edith Win­
chester and Mrs. White, matron of 
Mellon Hall.
Cider and doughnuts were the “di­
versions” of the evening. Much credit 
is due to Ann MacDonald and her 
committee, Thelma Adams, Florence 
Lutz. Marion Layton, Ruth Sclienck 
and Eleanor Fostei*.
COLLEGE8 DI8CU88
WORLD DISARMAMENT
The question has arisen as to what 
was the purpose of the Inter-Collegl- 
ate Disarmament Conference. The 
principal purpose was to hear noted 
men speak on tho subject and to for­
mulate a plan In order to stimulate 
a more actlvo discussion of the whole 
subject of disarmament in the col­
leges, with the possible view of hav­
ing later an expression of opinion in 
tho form of a straw vote, rather than 
that of seeking to influence the dele­
gates of the Washington Conference.
The Inter-Collegiate committee was 
certain that it could not hope to 
sway In any manner the official as­
sembly which convenes In Washing­
ton in November, but that it can hope 
to stir up interest and discussion in 
tho different colleges represented. 
The delegates, on Ihojir ¡return , to 
their respective colleges, are expect­
ed to begin publicity campaigns in 
order to bring the matter up before 
the attention of the students.
The opinion is that if all the stu­
dents of all the universities would 
say, in unison, “We want disarma­
ment,” the conference at Washington 
might hear them, whereas the voice 
of fifty or a hundred Inter-Collegiate 
representatives at Princeton, would 
not and could not accomplish such a 
renult.
Carnegie Tefcli was represented at 
the conference by Dan Cassidy and 
his report will be published in the 
next issue of the Tartan.
SONG OF SONGS WELL RECEIVED
Divested of all mystic interpreta­
tion, presented as a human document 
symbolistic of its (period' and charac­
teristic oi! its author, a king of Israel 
who wrecked his kingdom through 
sensuality and sacrificed the destiny 
of his people to the satisfaction of 
his ambitions, the “Song of Songs” 
was offered last Wednesday by the 
Drama Department, at the Arts The­
ater, under the direction of Mr. Os­
borne.
With Renan as an .authority; guid­
ed by the keen, flawless, almost re­
lentless analytical powers of one of 
the master minds of the Nineteenth 
Century, Mr, Osborne achieved a real 
“tour de force” and brought to a suc­
cessful, satisfactory termination what 
seemed at first to most of us a hope­
less undertaking. He disassociated us 
from our accepted view of the mean­
ing of the “iSong of Songs” and made 
us admire that which we, at first, 
thought we would scorn or be offend­
ed at. I-Ie attained this by a dignity, 
a sincerity, a reverence of presenta­
tion, the creating of an atmosphero 
as impressive and solemn as that of a 
temple, the preservation of the text 
in all its poetry, its magic, its simple 
grandeur, the imposing simplicity of 
tho singe settings, ancl a system of 
lighting tho artistry of which cannot 
be overpraised.
The main characters of the song 
wore acceptably filled by Miss Liss- 
felt, Mr, Lubin, Mr. McLure, and Mr, 
Lazarus, while the ICliazan of tho 
story, in the hands of Mr. Carl Reid, 
was invested' with Lhe dignity, the in­
telligence and the understanding 
which characterizes this man’s work. 
As the Shulamlte, Miss LiBsfelt was 
always an interesting nnd pleasing 
figure, graceful and dignified in her 
movements, intelligent in tho reading 
of her linos, and most convincing in 
tho portrayal of hoiHuigulsh. She was 
at her best In tho third scene, tho 
Intonso simplicity ol' her acting add­
ing greatly to tho quality of tho omo 
tional response which sho evoko^l as 
tho victim of fate. The only' criti­
cism, ol! her performance is for her 
voice 'which, in tho intense moments, 
had a tendency to guttoralness and 
a tremulo marring the diction. Mr. 
Luban, as tho king portrayal, tho Ori­
ental potentate, cunning, Ingratiating, 
pleading and failing in these, lustful 
and despotic, with effective apprecia­
tion. Mo could have shown a more 
varied expression of feeling in the 
third scone,, the seraglio, but tho part 
is a. trying one and demands much 
powver.
As the shepherd-lover, Mr. McLure 
was- satisfying. Mr. Lazarus “An Old 
Man,” displayed a fine voice, an at­
titude of fervor and an intensity of 
feeling which made him a conspicu­
ous figure in the first and second 
scenes. The rest of the cast was ac­
ceptable. , Three of the four wives 
should learn how to walk and how to 
soften an either natural or acquired 
harsh mode of voice emission. A 
greater respect for rhythm on the 
part of the tambourine player might 
have made endurable the monotony 
of repetition of the slender musical 
theme.
Mr. A. Wyckoff, the Art Director, 
and Mr. McAteer, in charge of lights, 
are both to be highly commended for 
their results.
EXCHANGES
THE FRESHMAN
New as the moon that first appears, 
A segment of a silver ring;
Fresh as a call of Chanticleer’s; 
Green as the up thrown blades of 
spring.
He swaggers lest they think him shy;
He cringes lest they find him brave; 
So boyish that he wants to cry;
So manly that he longs to shave.
Upon tho altar of Romance 
He filngs his hopes with eager hand 
And casts a dumb, adoring glance 
To where the football players stand.
And Youth, to compensate his fears, 
Unveils a splendid, shining dream; 
He sees himself in future years 
The pride and captain of the team.

AMERICAN FELLOWSHIP
IN FRENCH UNIVERSITIES
Dr. Baker calls attention to the an­
nouncement on the Bulletin Board 
by the postoffice, of the American 
Field Service Fellowships for French 
Universities. The Society for Ameri­
can Field Service Fellowships for 
French Universities ¦will offer for 
open competition among graduates of 
American colleges and othor suitably 
qualified candidates, a number of fel­
lowships, not to exceed twenty-five

vanced study and research in French 
Unlvorsitios during 1022-28.
The fellowships, of the annual 
value of $200 and 10,000 francs, are 
granted for ono year and are renew­
able for a sooond year. Among the 
subjects in which they may be award­
ed are the following:

Engineering.
English Language and Literature.
Geology.
History.

I’m the guy who is always in 
hurry. If anyone is in my way, I 
push them aside. Why shouldn’t I? 
Haven’t I got as much right to go 
where I please as anyone? If a group 
of girls are going through the door 
into chapel, and they go too slow to 
suit me, why I push right through 
them. Haven’t I the right to, I can’t 
wait all day on them. And also when 
I want to get my mail at the P. O. 
I generally manage to get up to my 
box, no matter who’s in the way. One

Sunday, as per our usual custom, 
we went with our girl to church. The 
minister during the course of the ser­

for helping out the poor heathens of

After the sermon the plate was

TEACHER PLACEMENT SERVICE
Requests are constantly coming to 
the office of the Placement Service of 
the' Department of Public Instruction, 
Harrisburg, Pa., for teachers specifi­
cally trained along certain lines. Many 
of these positions not only offer 
larger fields of service, but very at­
tractive compensation.
The Placement Service is unable to 
suggest candidates for these positions 
due to a paucity of registrants.
We are calling the attention of the 
alumni and of the teachers of Penn­
sylvania to the advantages of regis­
tering with the Placement Service. 
By so doing not only shall school of­
ficials be rendered valuable service, 
but worthy teachers the opportunity 
for deserving promotion.
The Placement. Service lias made 
no effort to solicit registration of 
teachers, although there were regis­
tered during the past year 3,643 teach­
ers. In most instances these teachers 
desired to be in positions nearer to 
home, nnd in larger fields of influ­
ence. Many were seeking promotion 
for which their additional profes­
sional training justly entitled them.
It was largely impossible to learn 
of vacancies prior to the establish­
ment of the Placement Service, ex­
cept through agencies operated for 
profit. During the brief period of op­
eration 250i teachers' have been placed 
through this bureau, representing 
salaries aggregating $300,000. The 
actual saving in fees for the teachers 
of Pennsylvania amounts to $18,000; 
If to this is added the registration 
fee of $2 required by commercial 
agencies a total saving of $24,000 has 
boon effected. However, this matter 
need not bo stressed. A greater piece 
of work tlinn this has been accom­
plished. Letters of. appreciation from 
school officials, from teachers and 
secretaries of board of education ex­
pressing their gratitude- for the serv­
ice rendered are on file in the Place­
ment Service.
1,250 requests for teachers have 
been received by the placement Serv­
ice. Great difficulty lias been ex­
perienced in finding teachers specifi­
cally trained for the positions va­
cant. That the Placement Service 
may function most effectively it, is 
necessary that the registration list of 
teachers be large. Registration cards 
are provided by which active and 
prospective teachers may register. 
These, may be had upon application 
to the Department of Public Instruc­
tion. At the same time that we are 
asking our readers to carry the in­
formation concerning the Placement 
Service to teachers, we are asking the 
alumni to give the widest possible 
publicity to the Placement Service, 
thereby rendering a valuable service 
not only to the teachers and schools, 
but to the children of this Common­
wealth.
Many superintendents and super­
visors are frequent visitors to the of­
fice of thé Placement Service, and 
many, teachers are using this office 
as a meeting place with school offi­
cials desiring teachers.
The Placement Service requests 
that we bring to the attention of the 
teachers the advantages that will, 
come from registering with the Place­
ment Service and ^ilso of the advis­
ability of school officials in nqed of 
teachers drawing upon the list of reg­
istrants on file in the Placement 
Service.
School officials are slowly gaining 
confidence in the work which the 
Placement Service is striving to do, 
namely, suggesting teachers specifi­
cally trained and properly certified I 
for iposlttons vacant. It will mate­
rially assist teachers if school offi­
cials and boards of education will 
notify the Placement Service of va­
cancies. By calling the attention of 
school officials to the service which 
the Placement Service stands ready 
to render and explaining briefly the 
desire of the Placement Service to be­
come a clearing place for available 
teachers and existing vacancies, the 
schools of Pennsylvania shall he ma­
terially assisted.

passed this order our girl leaned 
over and in a loud stage whisper 
asks:
“Didn’t the minister say the collec­
tion was for the poor African sav­
ages who don’t even have clothes?” 
Terribly embarrassed at this rather 
indelicate question we managed be­
tween our blushes to gargle a “Yes.” 
Even this did not exactly satisfy 
our girl for she leaned over a minute 
later and asks again in that same con­
fidential whisper:
“Well, if they haven’t any clothes, 
what was your idea in dropping a 
pants button in the plate?” — Michi­

Stay in school. Make sacrifices if 
necessary, forego pleasures if finances 
are short, work your way through 
school if the money problem presses; 
whatever the apparent handicaps 
there is a way somewhere and the 
years spent in study now will be the 
most valuable investment you will 
ever make. Parents who encourage 
tlieir sons and daughters to keep on 
in school are doing a favor to the 
next generation of Americans as well 
as to themselves. Let there be no 
mistake about it. The world wants 
educated men and women. The edu­
cated citizens will make the history 
of the next decades as they are mak­
ing the history of this one and have 
been making the history of past ones. 
Be one of the history makers.—The

LafayetteOn The Plaid Screen
BY H. L. MOERSFELDER
THE TECH HARRIERS
CroSS Country Team Wins/ The Carnegie cross-country team is to be congratulated on their decisive1 win over Lafayette College, here last Saturday. This victory gives Tech the 
first clinch on claiming the eastern championship. The Lafayette team had 
not been defeated in twelve years until their defeat by the Plaid. Lehigh 
proved no match for the speedy Tech harriers, the latter winning by a per­
fect score," over the South Bethlehem course.
Coach Bruce of Lafayette praises highly the ability of the Carnegie 
team and in his opinion there is no team in the east which has as good a 
record as the lech harriers, which seems to indicate championship in that

Tech made itself famous in cross 
country last Saturday when the 
Lafayette hill and dalers were taken 
over by the decisive score of IS to 37. 
It. was one of the fastest and best 
races ever run over the Schenley 
Park course. Miller, captain of the 
Tartan squad, set up a new record 
of 31:56 2-5 for the course, breaking 
his old record of 32:15 made last year. 
Kelley also finished in better time 
than the old record. Crawford, Lafay­
ette’s ace, crossed the line in fourth 
place.
The runners finished as follows: 
First, Miller, Tech, 31:56 2-5; second, 
Kelley, Tech, 32:10 4-5; third, Dyke- 
man, Tech, 32:201-5; Fourth, Craw­
ford, Lafayette, 33:20; fifth, Green­
law, Tech, 33:35 1-5; sixth, Tracey, 
Lafayette, 34:00; seventh, Tubbs, 
Tech, 34:05 1-5; eighth, McFall, Lafay­
ette, 34:40 1-5; ninth, Harger, Lafay­
ette, 35:25; tenth, Boettcher, Lafay­
ette, 36:00; eleventh, Kemper, Lafay­
ette, 36:25 3r-5;i twelfth, Gotham, 
Tech, 36:40; . thirteenth, Mendenhall. 
Tech, 37:25 1-5.
The Lafayette team was the best 
in the East last fall. Out of last year’s 
team four veterans are back. In the 
last 12 years they have not lost a 
meet.
Now that Tech has turned the 
triclc in such a conclusive manner it 
means that the Plaid squad is one of 
the best in the country. Cornell puts 
out good cross country teams and are 
out to take over the Inter-Collegiate 
championship this year. If possible 
a meet may he arranged with them 
later on in the season.
On Saturday the team goes to State 
College to meet the Penn iState and 
University of Pennsylvania before 
the Teoh-State game. State has some 
good men; among them Romig, a for­
mer Inter-Collegiate champion and 
Shields, another good man. However,

Pittman staged a great come-back 
when placed in the game toward the 
end. With a sprained foot not quite 
healed, he carried the ball three 
times around ends for a total of 34 
yards. Not once did he fail to ad­
vance the ball at least 10 yards.
GOOD WORK
The cross country manager wishes 
to express his appreciation and thanks 
to the men who acted as officials and 
checkers in the meet with Lafayette 
last Saturday. The support shown 
was of the best, and it is hoped it 
will vcontinue in the future.
Eddie Lewis of Alabama, had quite 
a reputation as a punter before com­
ing to Carnegie Tech. Now, lie has 
that same kind of a reputation right 
here at Tech. Hisl first quint for Car­
negie Tech was a beauty. It spiralled 
beautifully through the air for fully 
55 yards. Lewis' punts are lucked 
from the side of hiis foot, and shoot 
out low at first, gradually rising to a 
high point, making a punt that is es­
pecially hard to get under.
Newman again showed his ability 
to each up into the air and grab down 
a long forward pass. This time, just 
as last Saturday, he raced across the 
goal line, and snagged a pass just be­
fore it completed its 30-yard journey 
through the air.
Comfort scored his first touchdown 
of the present season. He received a 
forward pass from Sawyer and raced 
the remaining twenty yards to a 
touchdown. Incidentally, this Cy 
Comfort has yet to miss a goal after 
touchdown. To dato, he has kicked 
twenty-five out of twenty-five. Asido 
from this, "Cy” is just about All- 
American tackle.
has a good chance of coming off tho 
victor. Now that tho team has proven 
itself those who are making the trip 
to State should give their support 
to the team Saturday.

NEWMAN CLUB BASKET BALL
JAMES L. ANDERSON 
VETERAN HALFBACK
The initial practice of the basket­
ball team of the Newman club, com­
posed of students from Pitt, Tech and 
Duquesne, was held Thursday night 
in the Cathedral High school gym on 
North Craig street. A squad of 20 
men reported and the light workout 
revealed some promising talent.
A number of all-scholastic men are 
on the squad and indications point 
to one of the fastest teams in inde­
pendent circles. Jimmy Doherty, for­
mer Tech star, has been secured to 
coach and this is an assurance that 
the squad will develop rapidly. The 
club is backing the teams strongly 
this year and record turnouts are as­
sured at all the games.
The management has linos out for 
the best fives in the Pittsburgh dis­
trict aud hopes to complete an attrac­

bituminous coal mines and tho de­
termination of acidity and a' survoy 
of the acid resisting metals available 
for use In coal mines., j n co-operation 
with sevoral coal companies operat­
ing mines in Western Pennsylvania, 
teats will be made on tlie acid resist­
ing metals selected on the basis of 
the above survey. The Various metals 
available for use in coal mine equip­
ment will bo immersed in flowing 
acid mine water and the character 
and extent of corrosion carefully 
noted.
Microscopic study of tho Freoport 
coal hod will he carried on by Mr. A. 
W. Voorhaes under the direction of 
Dr. Reinhart Thiessen of tho Bureau 
of Mines. Mr. Voorhoes holds a de­

problems in the Coeur d’Alens region. 
In his college work he specialised in 
chemistry, economical geology and 
petrology, also special work on the 
preparation of thin petrographic sec­
tions for microscopic study. His re­
search investigations will consist of a 
study of the technique of preparing 
opaque, thin sections of bituminous 
coals and their analysis under the mi­
croscope, followed by a special study 
of the Freeport coal bed for the pur­
pose of compilating the seam from 
bottom to top, including the bone and 
cannel coal constituents, and their re­
lationship to their distillates.
The study of the tendency, of vari­
ous Pennsylvania bituminous coals 
to fire spontaneously will be made by 
Mr. J. S. Byrne under the direction 
of Mr. Joseph D. Davis of the Bureau 
of itfines: Mr; Byrne is a graduate

has also prepared a technical paper 
on the metallurgy of nickel. His re­
search investigations will consist of 
the development of experimental ap­
paratus for measuring temperatures 
and their control, analysing reaction 
products and controlling circulating 
gasses, Spontaneous combustion 
tests will lie made on bituminous 
coals from the Pittsburgh, Freoport

Ono ot the most Interesting art 
shows In Pittsburgh Is that of the 
Associated Artists. It opens tho art 
year, and the present Show is ono.of 
the best and most Interesting hold 
by the local artists. It Is supposed 
that, in the main, tho works shown 
represent what has been done In tho 
past two years, and some of the pres­
ent summer's paintings are of sub­
jects as widely separated as Maine 
and California. Many artists who 
have received their training 'n Pitts­
burgh and are now located elsewhere 
send pictures each year for this exhi­
bition. Names well known in New
Tho Carnegie Toch football toam reached the hlgh-point mark in her 
scoring for the present season when she rolled the. team from Allegheny 
College to tho high score of 56-0. After this gamo no ono can dispute tho 
fact that the Plaid machine of 1021 is by far the best team ever placed upon 
the field by tho Skibos.
Throughout tho game it was just one continuous series of brilliant end 
runs, line plunges, forward passes, double passes and punts on the part of
tho Carnoglo Tech gridders. in every department of the gamo, tho Plaid
"f*adhoronts wore kept in a continuous 
applause, wliilo tho adherents of the 
Moadville eleven were never even so 
much as hopeful. The Alloglieny team 
failed miserably to do their part nec- 
ossary to producing a real football 
contest, for their forwards seemed on- 
tiroly unable to stotn tho onrush of 
the Toch backs, while tholr own 
hacks were never able with but two 
exceptions to penetrate tho stone­
wall defense of tho Tech lino. Penal­
ties and fumbles, none of which were 
costly, In that none endangered the 
gamo from the viewpoint of depriving 
Toch of a victory, kept the score 
down. Again, if Toch had soon lit to 
koop her lirst-string men in. the game 
throughout the contest, the score 
might have mounted to porhaps dou­
ble tho score.
The Plaid can stand quito a few 
criticisms, for It must bo admitted 
that tho showing while lino in some 
departments was somowhat liolow par 
in others. Those must bo corroctod 
before the Stato game, if a good show­
ing Is to bo made. Tho fumbles woro 
glaring. Tho penalties woro moro 
glaring. Further word along this Is 
ontlroly unnocossary, for tho coach­
ing staff saw the same, and will do 
all In tholr power to further prevent 
Its repetition.
Sawyer again proved his wonderful 
ability to throw tho forward pass, by 
completing fivo out of nine attempts, 
which Is considered a wonderful roc* 
ord. Those woro responsible for tliroo 
of the eight touchdowns. One wont, 
from Sawyer, thirty yai'ds through tho 
air, and foil square In tho outstretch­
ed hands oil Newman, as ho rushed 
across the Alloglieny goal lino. An­
other wont Into tho hands of Comfort, 
who after receiving It, ran tho re­
maining twenty yards to a touchdown. 
Tho othor went to Robortson. Tho 
typo of this Corvjrrf n/MP* tb.r(nvi.t„ 
groat, stress on the ability of Sawyer, 
for he has to pick out Ills man, and 
then throw the ball to him.
Robertson and Wclrman wore again 
distinct stars In carrying the hall 
around tho ends, with perhaps tho 
greater glory going to Robortson, duo 
to bis spectacular run of 80 yards to 
a touchdown from a punt. Those 
runs wore made possible through tho 
porfoct Interference of Sawyer, An­
derson, II. Potter and the ends, Their 
ability to take off opposing taoklors 
was marvelous, and Indeed most won­
derful to ahic

COLUMBIA STADIUM
Tlired separate stadiums are to bo 
built by Columbia University. Thoro 
will be a football amphlthoator, 
which will have a minimum capacity 
of 56,000 and will be in tho general 
shape of a flat saucer. To the north 
of tills, along the Hudson liver, will 
be the baseball diamond, surrounded 
by. a single-deck stand capable of seat­
ing about 7,000. In the northeast cor­
ner of the field there will be erected a 
track stadium, seating 10,000 and en­
closing a field for track and field con­
tests, a 220-yard straightaway track 
and a one-lap circular cinder path, 
measuring a quarter mile. The total 
capacity of these three concrete 
stadiums, which were designed by 
Henry Hornbostel of the class of ’81. 
will be 73,000.
In addition to this trio of fields 
there will he 20 tennis courts and a 
clubhouse on the top of the hill over­
looking the various fields. On the 
various fields. On the river sido of 
tlie clubhouse there will be a spacious 
veranda, and inside will bo a restau­

thereby to give every spectator a 
cloar view of what Is taking place on

I pass he advanced the ball from the -10 
yard lino to tho one foot lino, only to 
unfortunately fumble after an especi­

so badly that ho was forced to retire

Why Is Iron Magnetic?
Aliorse-shoc magnet attracts a steel needle. But why? 
k. We don’t know exactly. We do know that electricity and mag­
netism are related.
In dynamos and motors we apply electro-magnetic effects. All our 
power-stations, lighting systems, electric traction and motor drives, 
even the ignition systems of our automobiles, depend upon these 
magnetic effects which we use and do not understand.
Perhaps if we understood them we could utilize them much more 
efficiently. Perhaps we could discover combinations of metals more 
magnetic than iron.
Tlie Research Laboratories of the General Electric Company investi­
gate magnetism by trying to find out more about electrons and their 
arrangement in atoms.
X-rays have shown that each iron atom consists of electrons grouped 
around a central nucleus—like planets around an infinitesimal sun. 
X-rays enable us to some extent to see into the atom and may at last 
reveal to us what makes for magnetism.
This is research in pure science, and nothing else. Only thus can real 
progress be made.
Studies of this kind are constantly resulting in minor improvements. 
But some day a discovery may be made which will enable a metallur­
gist to work out the formula for a magnetic alloy which has not yet been 
cast, but which will surely have the properties required. Such a result 
would be an achievement with tremendous possibilities. It would 
improve all clcctric generators, motors, and magnetic devices.
In the meantime the continual improvement in electrical machinery 
proceeds, in lesser steps. These summed up, constitute the phenom­
enal progress experienced in the electrical art during the past twenty- 
five years.

"Criticism, even though temporar­

“Here, it seems to me, lies one of 
the great fields for organized effort 
on tlie part of the alumni associa­

the university and the alumnus, to act 
as interpreter when necessary, keep­
ing alive in the spirit of the busy 
alumnus the academic love of learn­
ing for its own sake, and to bring 
into tlie life of the University a spirit 
of progress and efficiency from the 
outside world. * * * It should wel­
come tlie criticism of hard-headed 
alumni to the end that the University 
may not march out of step with the

Nearly .every student in school 
has occasion every once iu a while 
to get a check cashed. After this 
happens just when one's room mate 
is also rather low financially or at 
the end of the week when cash is 
needed to eat on Sunday. Only the 
few favored ones are able to- get a 
check cashed at Skibo or the cash­
ier’s office, and a trip down town 
takes time. In many schools special 
attention is given to the need by ar- 
ranging for a fund of a few hundred 
dollars to be on hand to cash stu­
dents’ checks A »¦Small fee of about 
one per cent or so is usually charged

ages of the [technicalN^iiege j>or 
women. ,
Director Bingfiam, Beloit,
Tech lias launched itself in a foot­
ball campaign which all Tech fans 
believe will be highly successtul. If 
our hopes and ambitions are not at 
present leading us far astray, we will 
establish ourselves in Class A foot­
ball this year. However, we should 
not become «o absorbed in our vi­
sions of success that we forget our 
part in the securing of it. Our duty 
includes attendance at every game 
and cheering.
Let us consider briefly that im­
portant accessory to football—cheer­
ing. To got to the point, let us 
analyse Tech cheering. First, there 
are the potential clieerers. We have 
plenty of these. Then there are the 
cheerleaders. We have two capable 
ones. Finally, there are cheer«. 
1-Ioroln we may And our weakness.
About (50 per. cent of the volume 
of our yells consists of the repeti­
tion of tho syllable "Ray.” This per­
centage and repetition is all light, 
and nl universal among school yells. 
But the difference lies in this basic 
cheering syllable. Practically all 
schools having an athletic reputa­
tion use the syllable "Rah” in their 
yells. This appears on paper to be 
an insigniflcant difference. But the 
use of "Rail” gives much more vol­
ume and force to the yell.
“Ray” is weak and ineffective. It 
is often used in a spirit of banter 
of derision. As some few ‘may re­
member, it i6 the second word in a 
little song that the children sing 
in grammar school. Melody and soft 
harmony are notj elements in cheers 
that will put pep into a team.
Football is a man’s game. It is 
oj fighting, smashing game. "Rah” 
starts deep down and ends up with' 
a snap. It is the kind of a cheer 
that an enthusiastic fan likes to give 
and a man on the team likes to 
hear. ,
If action is ever taken to change 
our yells, no doubt some individuals 
will hasten forward, horrified at the
