Dr. Webster N. Jones Reveals 
Engineering Summer Schedule
In October, 1947, the College of Engineering and Science 
will return to the prewar program of two semesters per academ­
ic year, according to Dr. Webster N. Jones, Director. To do 
this, the 1947 summer semester will be used as a first' step to 
get students on a two-semester basis, and w'ill be the last slim­
mer semester to be given.
Since most courses will be offered hereafter only once a year 
and will be filled to the limit with regular registrants, students 
who fail to attend the summer semester according to the plan 
described below will usually lose two semesters or more:

In M]ay, 1942, the College in­
augurated the trimester plan now 
in effect in order to supply more 
graduate enegineers and scient­
ists for the war effort and also to 
enable Carnegie students to ob­
tain as much formal education as 
possible before entering the arm­
ed services.

Attend Banquet 
At Webster Hall
Any student who participates to 
even a modest extent in extra­
curricular activities can count on 
at least one event as inevitable: 
in the due and hectic course of 
events, he will be invited to a 
banquet.
These banquets are of innumer­
able varieties, varying from the 
intimate and uncomfortable for­
mal little affair which is period­
ically squeezed into the Union to 
the large-scale demonstration of 
campus prestige and fiscal power 
which requires the Imperial Room 
of the Webster Hall in order to 
display its wares in an adequate 
setting.

1947 Soph Hop,
On Ides of March, 
Is Roman Holiday
It’s going to be a Roman holiday 
on Saturday, March 15, when 
Cwens and Scimitars, the sopho­
more honoraries, present the an­
nual Soph Hop. To be held in the 
men’s gym from 9:00 until 1:00, 
the dance will feature the music 
of Baron Elliott and his orchestra.
The dance itself, at the request 
of most Techites, will be informal 
—the first such affair of the se­
mester. Fred Frank, chairman of 
the dance, has announced that 
there is to be some novel enter­
tainment by outside talent during 
intermission. Both the entertain­
ment and the decorations will 
carry out the Roman theme.
The other chairmen for the 
dance are Mary Lou Thorpe, dec­
orations; Sema Moskovitz, tickets; 
Bennard Perlman, publicity; and 
Fred Frank, entertainment.
Although tickets will be on sale 
at the dance in the athletic of­
fice, students, are asked to make 
an effort to buy them before Sat­
urday. Representatives will sell 
the ducats in Skibo, the dorms, and 
fraternity houses for $1.75 per 
couple. Plans have been made to 
give a part of the profits to the 
Home Economics club to aid in 
their support of a war orphan.

School Mourns 
Mildred Lawton, 
Student Favorite
Miss Mildred E. Lawton, curator 
of the music department, died 
Saturday, March 1, after an ill­
ness of over a year. Her passing 
was deeply felt by members of 
the student body and faculty of 
the music department. Despite 
her failing health, Miss Lawton 
remained at her desk until two 
days before her death.
She had been known to music 
students since she joined . the 
school staff in 1916. Over the 
years many generations of em­
bryonic musicians looked to her 
for advice, consolation, and 
friendship.
As a final tribute, the music de­
partment chorus sang the'Lachry- 
mosa from the Mozart Requiem 
at the services, accompanied by 
Professor Charles A. H. Pearson, 
department head, who himself 
came in early contact with Miss 
Lawton as a student at CIT.
Andreasson Leads 
String Ensemble
A concert of classical music 
will be presented by the String 
Ensemble of the department of 
music, conducted by Mr. Goesta 
Andreasson at Carnegie Music 
hall on Sunday, March 16, at 8:15 
p. m.
The first selection will be the 
Concerto Grosso in D minor by 
Handel. Soloists are Robert Hol­
loway and Lester Trimble, vio­
lins, and Jane Kalbfus with the 
cello.
The soloist in Bach’s Concerto 
in D minor for Piano and Orches- 
will be Carol Myers. Arensky’s 
Variations on a Theme by Tchai­
kovsky and the Serenade by Mo­
zart wil conclude the program.
S&S Shows; Claghorn Doesn’t
Who threw the arsenic in Sen­
ator Claghorn’s lemonade? At 3:40 
he called to say he was a little 
,late, but still healthy. At 4:15 he 
called again, this time with a case 
of ptomaine poisoning so serious 
that he could just barely drag 
himself out to Greek society din­
ner two hours later.
The Senator Kenny Delmar, had 
made arrangements to give a 
show here at 3:30 on March 4. 
The announcement of his intention 
was received with loud cheers by 
a publicity-seeking Scotch and 
Soda cast. They rushed around 
madly collecting atmosphere to 
make the Senator feel at home. 
Helen Zimmerman and Deanie 
Miller squeezed into southern 
crinolines while four other girls 
donned shorts for the occasion.

Anthony L. Antin of Red Bank, 
New Jersey, a senior at Rutgers 
university, has been appointed as­
sistant to the editor of the news 
service, effective July 1. Antin’s 
priniipal duty will be that of ad­
visor to student publications. 
Enviable Record at Rutgers
Recently elected to Phi Beta 
Kappa, national scholastic hon­
orary, Antin will be graduated 
from Rutgers this June. During 
his undergraduate years the new 
Carnegie Tech appointee was ed­
itor of the student newspaper, a 
cheerleader, member of the stu­
dent council, a member of both 
the junior and senior honorary 
societies, and coxswain of the 
varsity crew.
Journalist Since Youth
Despite his youth, Antin has 
been in the field of journalism for 
almost a decade. During his high 
school days he edited the school 
paper and worked as a reporter 
and feature writer for the Red 
Bank Daily Standard, and in the 
years following he worked for 
other local newspapers.
Antin served for eighteen 
months with the 69th Infantry 
Division and five months with the 
Air Corps Special Service Office. 
After receiving a medical dis­
charge in February of 1945, he 
enrollen in the Rutgers School of 
Journalism. A few months later 
he was given the job of reviving 
the student newspaper, which had
WCIT Produces 
Morning Clambake
Having suffered the pains of a 
young mother, the staff of WCIT 
who produced the new feature, 
the morning “Clambake,” are now 
assimilating the comments that 
follow any new “baby.”
The concensus of opinion seems 
to be that it is a program worth 
listening to, although the name 
implies anything but that. The 
Glossary of Radio Terms describes 
a “clambake” as “a program, the 
rehearsals of which are character­
ized by uncertainties and errors, 
and the production of which seems 
ultimately destined for failures!”
As long as the program doesn’t 
sound like its definition, Techites 
will be tuning in at 9:00 every 
7:30 a. m.
Gossip Envelope
Hedda Hopeless says, “I wish 
I did, but I don’t. In fact, I wish 
I could but I can’t. I’d really 
loooove to!” What Hedda means 
is that she wishes she was ac­
quainted with all her fellow stu­
dents. She wishes she could get 
to know everyone, but it’s impos­
sible.
So she asks that bits of gossip 
(“Scandalous, if possible”) be put 
in the WCIT gossip envelope on 
the Skibo bulletin board. It will 
be broadcast, Hedda promises. 
Man Shortage
In C725 it is asserted that there 
is a reason for everything. The 
reasons why the fraternities were 
unable to tune in the first ten 
minutes of one of last week’s pro­
grams: the dramats and music 
students of staff were busy mov­
ing the studio piano, WCIT’s elec­
trical engineer was busy painting 
the studio office baby blue, the 
announcer was busy announcing, 
and the station secretaries were 
all out on dates with NBC exec­
utives (field trips) so that left 
nobody to throw the switch!
The Roundtable of the Air will 
discuss the question “Fraternities 
and Sororities, Asset or Liability,” 
tonight at 7:30. Students partici­
pating are Jean Knee, Louise Dean 
Miller, Richard Drisko, and Wil­
liam Beamer.

Police Crack Down 
On Illegal Parking
A letter from George E. A. Fair­
ley, the director of4he department 
of Public Safety of Pittsburgh 
brought to the attention of Dr. 
Doherty the fact that students 
have been violating a traffic or­
dinance on Margaret Morrison 
street.
The exact position of this illegal 
parking area is across the street 
from Scobell hall on the first 
curve as one goes toward the gym. 
He stated that the city traffic de­
partment has placed a warning 
sign at this location which clearly 
states “no parking at any time.”
On a number of occasions, Mr. 
Fairley says that he has noticed 
cars parked on this curve direct­
ly under the city warning sign. 
Since the individuals who park 
there are paying no attention to 
the sign, he feels that he will have 
to direct the traffic police to tag 
all cars which are found there.
Both Dr. Doherty and Mr. Fair­
ley hope that the students will 
heed this warning, as in the future 
all cars parked in this area will 
be tagged.
Subsidize Training
“Are Federal subsidies the So­
lution to the Acute Shortage of 
Technically Trained Men and 
Women,” the subject of this 
week’s “Soap Box of the Air”, will 
be of particular interest to en­
gineering and science students.
This weekly discussion pro­
gram is the eighth of the series, 
which started in January and will 
continue through the spring. The 
program, which is broadcast from 
the University Club auditorium 
over station WWSW on Tuesday 
evenings at 8:00 p.m., is in the 
form of a discussion. The first 
half-hour is devoted to talks by 
the four student speakers, with 
the remaining half-hour being a 
question-and-answer period.
Carnegie Tech will team up 
with Duquesne on the negative 
this week, opposing Pitt and Mt. 
Mercy. Representing CIT is Pa­
tricia A. Conner, a junior in 
MMCC, majoring in social work.
Duquesne’s speaker will be Wil­
liam I. Hillebrand, a sophomore 
in arts and science, doing gradu­
ate work in chemistry.

Join New Club for 
Sane(? ) Capitalism
Yoiks, you would-be capitalists! 
Could be you are in doubt about 
the chances of acquiring a ten- 
thousand-a-year job within a 
year after graduation from dear 
old Tech? Since such a position 
is really necessary to pay debts 
incurred in college, apply imme­
diately for membership in the 
Sane Capitalism Club.
This worthy organization has 
been organized recently at Prince­
ton university, with the serious 
intent of expanding and strength­
ening the capitalistic system.
If the future as an engineer (or 
what have you) is not your chief 
concern, and the Greek’s is closed, 
write to the Sane Capitalism Club,
22 Patron Hall, Princeton, N. J., 
and request permission to form a 
new chapter.
Jlettesi
After an extensive perusal of 
the honorary fraternities at CIT, I 
am convinced that the system is 
unnecessarily restricted, both in 
numbers and variety. I have been 
unable to count more than sixteen 
honorraries. By the side of the 
magnificent and intricate struc­
ture of the points system, a sys­
tem that will soon require ac­
countants. and appraisers to ad­
minister it, the sixteen honorar- 
ies are positively insignificant.
To remedy this untoward situa­
tion, I have a plan. In ancient 
times it was the custom to induct 
all those worthy of honor into an 
all-embracing society. The fallacy 
of this idea has been completely 
exposed, and today at Carnegie, 
there are honoraries for sopho­
mores, juniors, seniors, Scottie 
writers, ROTC students, and 
others. Now, if a thing is good, 
more of it is better. Let us have 
an honorary for every option in 
every department of the school. 
Let us have honoraries for each 
department and each college in 
the school. Let us have honoraries 
for every publication, every soc- 
ciety in the school. Why not have 
everybody join the fun, with 
every single organization in the 
school having its honorary. At the 
standard $25 initiation fee, some­
body will make millions.
Of course we will require inter- 
honorary councils, scores of them. 
These will be arranged in various 
levels, depending on the splendor 
of the organizations involved—a 
grand concatenation o? tier upon 
tier of honoraries. It will dazzle 
the eyes.
One striking advantage I have 
forgotten to mention; the BMOC’s 
will be able to win a thou­
sand times as many keys. 
Why, they will have so many keys 
that the key-chains will have to 
be replaced by stout hawsers to 
support the weight. At the risk of 
appearing facetious, I will say that 
this vision will commend itself to 
the eyes of many besides myself.
The more I consider this idea, 
the better I like it.
Very sincerely yours,
Marty Dorff

Why So Few Tickets?
The war is over, but here on campus culture is still on the 
ration list. Not only is it rationed, but block-long lines form to 
obtain what there is of this scarce commodity.
Several hundred students filled the corridors of Administra­
tion and Industries halls last Thursday morning hoping to be 
one of the privileged few who would receive tickets for the Dra­
ma department presentation of King Lear. Forty minutes after 
the distribution had begun, every one of the 450 student passes 
was gone. And the corridors were still filled, for such is the 
appetite of the traditionally non-aesthetic technical students for 
the superior selections and excellent productions of the Drama 
school.
Though the insuflficent number of tickets available to meet 
student demands has frequently been attributed to the Scotch 
ancestry of the administration, there are several valid reasons 
why there are so few tickets distributed in proportion to the size 
of the student body. In order to discuss these reasons properly, 
it is necessary to determine just how many tickets can actually 
be given out and the present nature of their disposition. In 
making this survey, the present play, King Lear, will be used as 
an example.
King Lear will run for fifteen performances, and the audienc­
es for six of these will be the students and faculty of several
-^hools and a number of other local educational institutions.
¦ seating capacity of the Little Theatre is but 392, there 
ly a little over 3500 tickets for these remaining nine per- 
lui^nces. A check on the distribution of these tickets shows that 
the 600 people on the patrons list and the 760 in the faculty 
directory are entitled to a pair of tickets each, and that the 
Drama students receive 400 tickets for their uses, 450 more go 
to day-school students with 270 being made available to the night 
school.
Why This Distribution?
The principle reason for this rather lopsided disposition is 
the necessity for assuring the Drama department of a full aud­
ience for each performance. Playing before audiences is essen­
tial in the education of Drama students, and the need for this 
experience is the primary reason for producing these plays.
When the Drama department first realized the need for 
audiences and found that it was unable to depend on students 
and faculty to fill the Little Theatre, it sent out invitations to 
members of the Board of Trustees and their friends. This was 
the first group of patrons. The list of patrons has grown until 
there are now as many waiting to add their names to the list 
as already on it. The patrons are people from the Pittsburgh 
area with a genuine interest in the theatre and the success of the 
Drama department. The list is comprised largely of high-school 
principles, other educators, and members of theatrical organi­
zations, all men and women wTho faithfully supply from their 
numbers a mature and appreciative audience.
In general the student body cannot be relied upon to fill
the Little Theatre for each performance of every play. There
was a heavy student demand for tickets for King Lear and 
You Can’t Take It With You, but the reception accorded less 
popular productions such as The Trojan Women have clearly 
demonstrated student infidelity. It is for this reason and for 
those previously noted that the Drama department continues 
its practice of distributing but one-fifth of the tickets for each 
performance to the student body.
We feel then that the Drama department is largely justi­
fied in their present mode of ticket disposition. But we are not 
entirely pleased with the manner in which the disposition is car­
ried out. We would therefore like to make the following rec­
ommendations: (1) the exact day and hour of distribution 
should be published wrell in advance; (2) only two tickets
should be given to a person no matter how many registration
cards he can produce; and (3) the hour of distribution should 
be changed from the inconvenient morning hour to 4:30. The 
latter time would give anyone an equal chance to secure tickets, 
with no eager “patron” having to cut classes to assure his 
evening of entertainment. —T. A.

TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
The Sounding Board
Nick Reed and 
“We’ll hold our own in football,” 
C.I.T. sports chief declares.
“Certainly Tech is coming back 
in football. We can’t expect to 
drop the sport for several years 
and then jump right back into the 
tough competition there is today 
without having some troubles,” 
Clarence Overend, director of in- 
intercollegiate athletics, said in an 
exclusive interview last week.
“But,” he continued, “wheai 
some of the disadvantages we «uJ 
laboring under now disappear, as 
they probably will in a year or 
two, we will be able to find our 
level and more than hold our own 
among schools which have an ath­
letic policy similar to ours.”
Feeling that football is at least 
an important, if not the major, 
rallying point for a large amount 
of school spirit, we visited Overend 
for the first-hand story of what 
Tech is doing to reinstate a pro­
gram of intercollegiate athletics 
comparable to that of pre-war 
years. We found him optimistic 
about the situation, though fully 
cognizant of the difficulties under 
which Tech must work.
Situation Not Yet Normal
In picturing the athletic situa­
tion today it was his contention 
that, “Things are still up in the 
air now from the upheaval of the 
war years. You must remember 
that other schools had V-5 and 
V-12 students during the war. A 
lot of these boys played varsity 
ball and are now returning to the 
campuses where they played in 
wartime. Skibo is definitely at a 
disadvantage in this respect, the 
AST didn’t send us many athletes. 
Also, in competing against liberal 
arts schools, Tartan players have 
the handicap of a tough curricu­
lum.
Up until about 1934 we had a 
College of Industries which gave 
many boys a break in their studies, 
though they certainly couldn’t be 
called snap courses. In 1926, 
for example, the year we beat 
Notre Dame 19-0, only 8 out 19 
letter winners were engineers. Al­
most all the rest were in the Col­
lege of Industries. Our policy right 
now is that we’re turning out well- 
rounded engineers first, athletes 
last.”
No CIT Funds for Athletics
A policy was set down by the 
board of Trustees in 1937. It stat­
ed that no CIT funds from any 
source will be used to support an 
athlete merely because he is an 
athlete. This policy was adopted 
because of the widespread feeling 
that the liberal grants of athletic 
scholarships made previously, were 
not compatible with Tech’s status 
as a particular type of educational 
institution.
Overend declined to comment 
on the Steffens Memorial Scholar­
ships which will again be given 
next year, pointing out that neither 
he nor the school had any connec­
tion with these scohlarships, the 
whole affair being an alumni pro­
ject. However, Jie did indicate that 
Tech’s rather prominent role in the 
national sports scene during the 
twenties and thirties was in a 
large measure due to the efforts 
and backing of the alumni.
Tech Wants the Smart Ones
Expressing his own personal as 
w'ell as professional agreement
SHAVES
YOU for 
3 months!
Bob Johnson
with the school policy, he contin­
ued, “From a practical standpoint 
we in the athletic department have 
always attempted to discourage 
any athlete from coming here un­
less Tech was actually the right 
school for that man. We want a 
man who will be here for four 
years and who won’t give us a lot 
of trouble scholastically. We 
don’t want to work with him for 
a year or two and then have him 
drop out of the picture. Our de­
sire has always been to get the 
smart ones, the ones who could 
hold their own at Tech under any 
conditions.”
In pointing out the tremendous 
value of all types of extra-curricu­
lar activities in turning out well- 
rounded individuals rather than 
just those with a “college educa­
tion,” “Buddy” Overend showed 
that his mind unlike his office, was 
not closed in by the walls of the 
gymnasium.
“Extra-curricular activities are 
a very definite asset to a graduate 
Don’t neglect the classroom, but 
if you just crawl in a hole, you’re 
sort of sunk to begin with. No 
student at Tech is too busy for 
such activities. ' Learn to budget 
your time.”
Be a Live Wire
He then went on to cite several 
men who were live-wires on cam­
pus and who later made successes 
of themselves in the business 
world. Much of their success he 
attributed to the lessons in hand­
ling and getting along with peo­
ple and in meeting situations that 
only activities outside the class­
room can give. He emphasized that 
friendships made in this way are 
often the strongest and most re­
warding a student can ever make.
“It doesn’t matter much what 
you do, whether it’s in athletics, 
publications, scientific or artistic 
groups, or any other type of ac­
tivity. No one is doing the school 
a favor by taking part in these 
activities, but each one has some­
thing to offer the student, and 
there’s no telling when something 
you learn in this way will give you 
a lot of help in later life.”
How true. How true.
Yets’ Insurance 
Can Be Reinstated
Recent action by Congress to 
extend the period in which ex- 
servicemen can reinstate their 
lapsed insurance policies without 
physical examinations has started 
a new boom in the insurance bus­
iness of Vétérans Administration 
offices.
During the first two weeks after 
the original deadline of January 
31, the VA division in Philadel­
phia reported that 26,625 veterans 
in the tri-state area of Pennsyl­
vania, New Jersey, and Delaware 
reinstated NSLI policies totaling 
$159,750,000.
Mr. G. Frank Hartman, insur­
ance officer for the VA’s Pitts­
burgh regional office, again re­
minded veterans to submit their 
reinstatement and remittances. 
The remittance must be received 
or postmarked within 48 hours of 
the date on which the form was 
executed.
Citcom Calls First Meeting; 
Theta Tau Hears Prof. Cooley

We protest! Why is there so 
much crying about something be­
ing wrong with the school spirit 
around here? Just take a look at 
Scotch and Soda! The enthusiasm 
is terrific, and more than a hun­
dred people are already working 
practically full time to make 
Rock ’n’ Riot! a success.
Highlights of the week: Les 
Stanford handed out scripts to 
the members of the dramatic cast 
after extracting from everyone an 
oath of secrecy: “I swear that I 
shall not divulge, disclose, repeat, 
publish, sing, hum, or enact and 
gag, punchline, song, situation, 
routine, plot, or detail of Rock ’n’ 
Riot! If I do, may I be farmed 
out to Pitt’s Cap and Gown!”
The dancers tried a new rou­
tine Saturday afternoon. It’s an 
upside down affair, with the girls 
carried by the boys—quite easy 
when Ruth Pivirotto does it. Val 
Senko tried and fell on her head. 
There was no damage to any im­
portant part of her body. P&D 
Souh Herb Saiger says “Dancing 
is hard work. Hardest work in 
school!” How does he know? He 
never works in school.
Scotch and Soda Man of the 
Week: George Wood, funniest
man on campus, will be one of 
the stars in the funniest show of 
the year. Rock ’n’ Riot! will cli­
max George’s rather varied the­
atrical activities this year. He be­
gan the season by writing music 
for Time of Your Life. Later he 
played the Dauphin in Saint Jogn, 
and at the beginning of 1947 star­
red as Aristophanes in his own 
In Relative Time. And tomorrow 
he will open as the old Earl of 
Gloucester in King Lear.
George found his true vocation, 
the stage, only after lengthy ex­
perimentation in various other 
professions. Born in Nashville, 
Tennessee (his sister, Beulah, is 
a veritable Southern Belle) he 
took a fling at medicine, and psy­
chology, spent four years in Art 
school, and for a while even was 
an engineer — at U.S. Army ex­
pense.
Somewhere along the line he 
discovered music — on a pump 
organ — and that unplugged a 
reservoir of songs and musical re­
vues which have poured forth 
ever since. At the same time, his 
dramatic vein began to throb, and

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN TUESDAY, MARCH 11, lvV
The Passing Parade
By Karl Klahr
If there is one thing a man can’t 
resist, it is the sight of a shiny 
new gun the day before the hunt­
ing season begins. There is a real 
uplift and a sense of power in the 
feeling that your poor dumb vic­
tim cannot escape, that its life or 
death is in your hands at no risk 
to yourself; you will hunt it down 
to the inexorable finale. It’s lots of 
fun, really, if you have the 
stomach for it. Plenty of people 
do. There is only one obstacle to 
overcome before you can go out to 
holler “Yoicks.” This little party 
will cost money, and money in the 
capitalistic system is something 
tt hurts to spend.
Congressmen Like to Hunt Too
Now these remarks, being an 
observation on human nature, ap­
ply not only to you and me, hum­
ble and benighted creatures that 
we are, but also to greater folk; 
to those who, by their dispassion­
ate interest in the affairs of the 
many, and by their devotion to 
simon-pure altruism, might be 
thought above such earthly pas­
sions as hunting and chasing wild 
game. Consider, then, the plight 
of a congressman who sniffs the 
scent of the forest and a-hunting 
would go' The high cost of living, 
especially caviar for entertain­
ing Soviet chauffeurs, is a terrific 
drain on this income, and he sim­
ply can’t afford the conventional 
hunt.
But there is an alternative for 
him. One can hunt other things
beside wild game, namely human 
things. And here to interject a 
definition from Webster’s 1950 dic­
tionary: communist—a term ap­
plied to the human animal when 
he is hunted.
The House Un-American Activ­
ities committee is now organizing 
a super-hunt that will make old 
Dan’l Boone look like kid stuff. 
First Hollywood and the movies 
wilt be investigated, for there are 
some movie stars who belong to 
the Democratic party, and where 
there’s smoke there’s fire. Then 
American colleges will be fine- 
combed for pink professors, pink 
student organizations, and pink 
text books. (No pink tooth­
brushes?)
Ridiculous Accusations Made
The height of the ridiculous 
came about these last several 
weeks when a Senate committee 
held hearings on the qualifications 
of one D. Lilienthal to head the 
Atomic Energy commission. Mr. 
Lilienthal, who is supported by 
68% of the Republican newspa­
pers, was accused again and 
again of being a communist sym­
pathizer. Senator McKellar 
brought witnesses from all over 
the Tennessee Valley to testify. 
The strongest testimony was a 
question asked of a half illiterate 
policeman. “Do you believe Lilien­
thal is a communist?” “Yes,” 
boomed the policeman. On such 
incriminating evidence, Congress-

student newspaper editors, when 
he was re-elected for a second 
term. However, after starting the 
paper back on its pre-war sched­
ule of twice a week publication, 
he resigned the office to accept a 
part-time position in the Rutgers 
department of public relations. He 
will remain there until he joins 
the Carnegie Tech staff in July.
An avid crew enthusiast, the 
new appointee has been coxswain 
in an amateur rowing club, and 
last year led a crew that beat 
every major crew in the East ex­
cept Navy, and raced in the In­
ternational Regatta in Seattle.
Also vitally interested in stu­
dent government associations, An­
tin was chairman of the Rutgers 
Veterans committee on legisla­
tion and is the designer of the 
functional setup under which the 
Rutgers Student Council now op­
erates.
They have never since had an em­
ployee who insisted on throwing 
parties every other day.
As to vices, Boo plays bridge. 
She also smokes a pipe. A medium 
sized pipe. She says she doesn’t 
like being conventional, and, also 
that it tastes better than cigar­
ettes. But at heart we feel that 
Boo is really conventional.
After all what girl, normal girl 
that is, doesn’t find mud puddles 
fascinating? Brief cases annoy­
ing? And doesn’t enjoying walk­
ing to town through back alleys?
She refused to give us a list 
of her activities, claiming that 
when their meagreness was no­
ticed people would think that she 
had bribed the Tartan to write 
this article. All she would say was 
that she belongs to the Retired 
Tartan Editors Quartet which 
meets in Skibo every Tuesday, 
and, over opium, reads the latest 
issue of the paper and tell how 
much better it was when THEY 
WERE EDITOR.
We will end with the encourag­
ing little fact that the world has 
not yet heard the last of Boo Girts.
I
T’S ONLY a memory now, the 
war cigarette shortage. But it was 
during that shortage that people 
found themselves comparing brands 
whether they intended to or not.
And millions more people found 
that the rich, full flavor of Camel’s 
superb blend of choice tobaccos 
suited their Taste to a “T.” And that 
their Throats welcomed the kind of
cool mildness Camels deliver.
Thus the demand for Camels grew 
so great that today more people are 
smoking Camels than ever before. 
But, no matter how great the de­
mand, this you can be sure of:
We don’t tamper with Camel quality. 
Only choice tobaccos, properly aged, 
and blended in the time-honored 
Camel way, are used in Camels.

deserted opera house in East Lib­
erty. And some place in the city 
there is a millionaire’s mansion 
that is still safe from robbery be­
cause, as Boo attempted to en­
ter, she set the burglar alarm sys­
tem off. Two minutes later she 
was surrounded by two gigantic 
guards. (She is so little one man 
could surround her easily).
“I’m not doing anything”, she 
said, trying to be original, but they 
didn't believe her, so she left at 
once.
One day, attired in an old rain­
coat, and two left boots, our fair 
dark-haired heroine entered one 
of the city’s most exclusive hat 
shops and asked permission to 
sketch hats, the owner grudgingly 
permitted Boo to work.
But she was being watched 
from the back of the store. In a 
quiet moment was heard the fol­
lowing remark in a deep French 
accent. “Oh, Jean, she is not 
there alone—watch her closely.” 
Boo quietly sunk in her chair and 
tucked her two left boots further 
under her.
The most exciting things hap­
pen to her in the summer; for in­
stance, she was a cake icer. The 
first thing she did upon report­
ing for the job was to knock over 
a cart of cakes. Then they started 
her icing. The job, however, last­
ed only eight hours. Seems she 
iced all the cakes on the wrong 
side.
Her love of bright lights and 
money comes from having been 
a Warner Theater cashier. She al­
so painted a “Quickie” sign in a 
beer distributor’s building on 
Murray Avenue. She felt she had 
arrived when a child stopped, 
turned toward its mother, and 
asked: “WHAT’S SHE DOING, 
WHAT’S SHE DOING? MA, 
WHAT’S SHE DOING?”
Boo was a draftsman-recep- 
tionist-switchboard operator in 
a steel mill one year. Then there 
was the summer she worked in 
an industrial designer’s studio. 
They still remember her there.
She spent two years at Sweet 
Briar, and had just decided to 
change from sociology to pre­
medicine when, and we quote, 
“Inspiration came upon me as I 
lay in a hammock one day wak­
ing up from a catnap.” So she 
came to Tech as a P&D.
Today her department says, and 
again we quote, “She should have
been a writer.” She also wants to 
be a veteranarian. We are speak­
ing, of course, about Betty Lou 
Girts.
She is called Boo. It is said that 
it was her mother’s comment upon 
first seeing her, but she modestly 
claims it is because she is so boo- 
tiful. (It might have come from 
bootipest).
As a normal person Boo has 
an alter ego. Its name is Topsie, 
and it’s a yellow mongrel, four­
teen years old. She says, “It acts 
like a puppy, just like its mis­
tress.”
Not that she hasn’t a serious 
side, because she is deeply affected 
by bars, hat shops, and haunted 
houses; the first two she sketches, 
and the other she explores. Her 
footsteps can still be seen in a

TUESDAY, MARCH 11, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Tartans End Home Season In Victory
CREGUT SPEAKS
And so the parade of Sports Editors continues. The mortality 
rate of authors of this column had been higher than that of fresh- 
r man in CIT. It seems that everytime someone turns around, another 
member of our staff has resigned for bigger and better things;
Such was the case with Andy Cantini. After his election to stu­
dent council and subsequent appointment to the post of Chairman of 
Publications, he found that he didn’t have the time to continue with 
his work on the Tartan. I’m sure that you will all agree with me 
that he will be sorely missed.
Grove City Cousins
The final home game of the basketball season turned out to be 
quite an exhibition. Grove City 
proved to be just the kind of 
team the Skibo’s could function 
against and before the night was 
over they had broken the all time 
scoring record. The 72 point to­
tal was 3 points more than the 
previous high of 69 against West 
Virginia in 1938.
The credit for the victory goes 
a long way. Mike Theodore and 
Leo Clougherty deserve much for 
their sharpshooting, endurance 
and aggressive play. Tass Katsel- 
las comes in for a lot for the way 
in which he has changed his style 
of play. Formerly point happy, 
since the coming of Clougherty 
and Theodore, Tass has been con­
tent to set up the plays.
George Meyers, in playing his 
last game for Tech, culminated a 
career that has not been gaudy 
but merited more praise than we 
could give him here. He has been 
the steadying influence all year 
and has always been the defen­
sive kingpin. George will be sore­
ly missed next year.
The highlight of the game came 
in the final quarter when Mel 
House, Tech’s stalwart reserve 
center came into the game. As 
Mel got up off the end of the 
bench that he had been balanc­
ing for most of the season, he 
nearly dumped Coach Donohoe on 
the floor off the other end—and if 
he didn’t do it then, the perform­
ance he put on in his farewell ap­
pearance was enough to do it.
With the tumultuos overation of 
the spectators ringing in his ears,
Mel proceeded to cover the whole 
floor in leaps and bounds and 
made 3 stirring fieM goals. It got 
to the point where the score keep­
ers found it necessary to remove 
all the other names from the 
scoreboard leaving only that of 
HOUSE No. 14 for identification 
purposes.
The Facts
Thanks to the able assistance of 
Bill Heidenreich and Fuzzy 
Thurston, shooting records of the 
team for the last two home games 
show some interesting facts. Less 
than 1% of the shots taken by the 
Skibos from further out than the 
four circle have been good. The 
only place where they have been 
able to hit consistently is within 
a radius of 10 feet from the basket.
And the most important .thing 
about this is that not until the 
last few games has there been 
any evident attempt to try and 
get the ball inside where the rec­
ord of conversions is consistently 
better. In view of the fact that 
most of the season we have been 
up against taller teams that have 
been able to control the rebounds 
for the most part, shooting from 
outside amounted to throwing the 
ball away. Not until recently did 
the boys seem to try to control 
the ball until they got in under 
the hoop, and since this attempt, 
consistently higher scores have 
been the result.
A plan for putting Tech back 
on the football map has recently 
been discussed in a meeting of 
the Dorm Council. The general 
idea is to enlist student support 
to draw high school gridiron nota­
ble to Tech and to Tartan teams.
This may be the opportunity that 
we have all been waiting for to 
drown the memories of the defeats 
of the past. With the new schedule, 
it should not require too much 
to produce some winning teams, 
and once the ball starts rolling 
there is no telling when it will 
stop. By next week the full story 
should be available find. y>e will 
pass it on to you,

First call for candidates for 
Spring Sports, TRACK, TENNIS 
and GOLF. All students interested 
are requested to report at once to 
the Athletic Office, Room 102, 
Men’s Gymnasium and fill out a 
questionnaire regarding experi­
ence in these sports. All students 
who are taking regular courses of 
36 units or more are elijjible to 
try out for these teams. Coaches 
are anxious to start practice as 
soon as the weather will permit.
Civils Capture Strike Playoff, 
Betas Upset By Kappa Sigs
The A.S.C.E. really eliminated all doubts of who would win the 
Strike League crown last Saturday by spliting the maples for 2467 
pins. This was 66 pins better than the second place A.T.O.’s could 
gather for the same three games. The Civils were trailing the A.T.O.’s 
in the third game when suddenly Ed Robertson and John Farnsworth 
caught fire and really started to hit the groove. Robertson hit the 
pins for 219 while Farnsworth brought in 209.
The Dorm Combine, T.N.T. match was unable to produce enough
pins to even compete for the top spot. The Combine managed to
rack up 2269 pins while T.N.T. could only get 2197.
Betas Win League Crown
More or less overshadowed by 
the Strike Leakue playoff was the 
crucial match between the Tau 
Delts and Betas for the Spare 
League crown. The Betas found 
little trouble in winning the first 
two games to clinch the title as the 
Tau Delts slipped badly off their 
early season form.
As the teams now stand ready 
for the playoffs it looks like the 
real fight will be between the 
Splits and Civils Who seem to be 
able to hit the eight hundred 
game more consistently than the 
Betas have indicated.
The Splits still appear to be 
the favorites mainly on the 
strength of their two leading 
bowlers, Bill Swaney and Donald 
Klein who captured the one two 
spot in individual honors with 
averages of 170 and 168. At the 
same time the Civils have proved 
their ability to win when they 
need to by winning a league cham­
pionship after losing their first six 
games. In any event the A.S.C.E., 
Split match will certainly leave 
the pinboy little time to loaf. 
Kappa Sigs Upset Betas
When the undefeated Kappa 
Sigs handed the Betas their first 
defeat of the season last week 
36-28, they emerged on top of 
the National as the only undefeat­
ed team.
The Kappa Sigs still have to 
beat T.N.T., and Kilroy before 
they can claim the league and if 
they can be beaten, T.N.T. will 
be the team that can do it. Last 
week T.N.T. beat the Delts in a 
real fire house game that was 
slowed down only for the shooting 
of numerous fouls. When the mar­
athon had ended T.N.T. was the 
winner 57-41, due largely to their 
first period flash of speed which 
netted them 20 points to the 
Delts 5.
Citcom Paces T.X.
The top spot in the Federal 
League is still hanging in c^oubt 
after last week’s results. Citcom 
had little trouble in the gather­
ing enough points from the 
A.T.O.’s in the first half to coast 
on to victory 31-25, while the 
T.X.’s just ran wild over the 
Dorm Combine as they hit the 
hoop for 39 points to the Cohbines 
14.
In the other big games of the 
week the S.A.E.’s solidified their 
right to the American League 
crown by running away with ball 
against the Hot Shots in winning 
53-25. The Hot Shots were the 
only team that S.A.E. really had 
to beat to climb into first place, 
and as they have already beaten 
the D.U.’s early in the season 
there seems little change that they 
will be dislodged unless F.P.H.A. 
can turn the truck.
In the other games in the 
American League the D.U.’s beat 
the Hot Rocks 33-28 in a close 
game while the Beta Sigs lost to F.P.H.A, 43-27,

Second in P-0
The Carnegie Tech Swimming 
Team brought its season to a 
close last Saturday when it plac­
ed second in the Penn-Ohio Col­
legiate Association swimming 
championship held at the Tech 
pool. Slippery Rock was first with 
64 points, Tech second with 43 
points, Westminster third with 32 
points, and Edinboro fourth with 
25 points. The meet was literally 
“loaded” with talent, as new con­
ference records were set in the 
300 yard medley relay, 50 yard 
freestyle, 150 yard backstrobe, 200 
yard breaststroke, and the 400 
yard free-style relay.
Although the Tartans were lim­
ited to but two firsts, Stu Lee in 
the diving, and Dave Luckey in 
the 200 yard breaststroke, they 
followed Slippedy Rock very 
closely throughout the meet by 
consistently placing in all events.
Dr., Cottrell, coach of Slippery 
Rock, was re-elected president of 
the association and the 1948 meet 
was fixed for February 29 at the 
Tech pool. Tech’s coach, A. E. 
Risedorph, was named honorary 
president, upon his retirement to 
head the city’s Bureau of Recrea­
tion.
The results:300 yard medley relay—Won by Slip­pery Rock, team of Ashcomb, Jones, and Morgan; second, Tech; third. Edinboro: fourth, Westminster. Time—3:18.2 (new conference record).

W. Va. Trounces 
Tartans 92-48
As far as the Carnegie Tech 
basketball team was concerned, 
the season should have ended last 
Thursday night, for, with a Na­
tional Invitation Tournament bid 
under their belts, Lee Patton’s 
mountaineers rode roughshod over 
the plaid to the tune of 92-48. 
Considering the fact that this 
same team beat W & J some 
weeks ago 90-50, it wasn’t too bad 
for the visiting team.
Patton used every man on the 
bench before the game was over, 
and only used his two scoring 
aces, Zirkel and Schauss the first 
half.
Little Leo Clougherty was high 
man for the Skibos with 20 points 
and the rest of the scoring spread 
out among eight other players. 
Mike Theodore was guarded very 
closely and only managed to get 
three buckets and one charity 
throw for 7 points, his second 
lowest score for the season. West 
Virginia used its fast break to 
very good advantage throughout 
the game, and with its great ad­
vantage in height controlled both 
backboards with very little diffi­
culty.
With three of Patton’s starting 
team freshmen, the other two 
juniors, and not a single player on 
the squad graduating this year, 
West Virginia has little to worry 
about for the next few seasons. 
This game marked the last ap­
pearance of George Meyer, stand­
out guard for three years, and 
Mel House, second team center. 
Both are due to graduate before 
the next season gets underway. 
However, of the other eight play­
ers who saw service, 4 are fresh­
men and the other 4 are sopho­
mores, so Coach Donohue should 
be able to build up a good team 
for the next season.
Between halves Coach Patton 
of the Mountaineers was present­
ed with a pair of old pants from 
Dov Carlson, Coach of the Pitt 
five, and a 1947 Chevrolet Sedan 
from the townspeople of Morgan­
town for giving West Virginia its 
best season in 43 years of basket­
ball.
Grove City 
Beaten 72-47
Spurred on by a cheering crowd 
that had come to witness the 
closing of the home season, and 
with the last good opportunity to 
gain their 3rd victory of the Jyear, 
the Skibos put on a dazzling ex­
hibition last Thursday night as 
they swamped a disinterested 
Grove City quintet 72-47.
The game started as a battle of 
the 2 victories, each team having 
won twice to date, and someone 
was going to have to get the third. 
Led by the one-two scoring punch 
of Theodore and Clougherty, the 
play making of Katseellas and 
Klein and the floor play of Mey­
ers, the long overdue Tartans 
broke their all time scoring rec­
ord.
The game started in the usual 
manner with Tech scoring first, 
little Leo Clougherty broke 
through the defense for a lay-up. 
But contrary to the usual proced­
ure, they kept right on going with 
a fancy display of passing and 
shook Clougherty loose for an- 
oother lay-up to put them ahead 
4-0. Then Tass Katsellas came 
through with a one hander from 
the middle before Red McClelland 
scored for the visitors with a set 
shot from the side. Katsellas then 
came back with another one hand­
er, followed by two fouls by The­
odore, a free throw by Clougherty 
and another lay up by Leo to set 
the score at 13-2 and force the 
Grovers to call for time. At the 
end of the rest period the Skibos 
continued their nice passing but 
were only able to collect two 
more points on two charities by 
Mel Klein before the end of the 
quarter.
I^he scoring pace was stepped 
up a little in the second stanza as 
the Grovers began to find them­
selves, and Tech had a little hard­
er time maintaining their superi­
ority. Mike Theodore assumed 
much of the scoring burden from 
Clougherty during this period and 
garnered 7 points. Meyers chip­
ped in with 4, Clougherty with 4, 
Chetlin with 3 and Katsellas with 
1 to stretch the lead to 19 points 
at half time. McClelland continu­
ed to be the big gun for the visit­
ors but Dunbar took some of the 
play away from him at the foul 
line as he made five consecutive 
free throws.
Returning at the end of the in­
termission the Grovers decided 
they better do something about 
getting back in the ball game and 
proceeded to bottle up the Plaid 
offense for most of the third quar­
ter. Led by Bish and McClelland 
they outscored the Tartans 20 
points to 10 to bring the score to 
44-35 and give all the appearances 
of making a close contest out of 
the game. Mike Theodore continu­
ed to lead the scoring for the 
home team with 8 points.
But the Skibos got hot again in 
the final period and proceeded to 
pound the visitors into the floor. 
Led by big Mel House, Tech scor­
ed 26 points to win going away.

Viennese Will Give Publications
Assembly Lecture
Dr. Max Graf, noted musicol­
ogist, will lecture for students and 
faculty on Tuesday, March 18, at 
11:30. Dr. Graf, one of the few 
living witnesses of the great ar­
tistic era in Vienna around the 
turn of the century, was a pupil 
of Anton Bruckner and a personal 
friend of Johannes Brahms, Gus­
tav Mahler, Arnold Schoenberg, 
and Richard Strauss. He will re­
ly on his background of experi­
ence to provide the basis for his 
discussion.
At the present time he lectures 
at The New School of Social Re­
search in New York. Dr. Graf 
has recently been appointed by 
the Austrian Minister of Educa­
tion to supervise the rebuilding of 
the cultural life in Vienna.
As a critic and writer Dr. Graf 
has long been an advocate of new 
trends in music as well as in 
poetry, painting, sculpture, and 
architecture. While in the United 
States, Dr. Graf has published 
three books, The Legend of a Mu­
sical City, which deals with his 
Viennese background and per­
sonal experience with the great 
of that period, Composer ' and 
Critic, a history of musical criti­
cism in the last two hundred 
years and Modern Music, which 
analyses the main problems of 
modern music.

6 was of the latter type, it had a 
neat variation in flavor which was 
characteristically its own. The 
various publications members 
gathered uncertainly in the hotel 
lobby a little before time, rather 
abashed in neat dark suits and 
even darker dresses. The indi­
vidual staffs collected in large 
knots to discuss business, while 
the varioiife editors peered suspi­
ciously at those who edged into 
the outer fringes of their groups.
A little after six o’clock, some 
one decided that it was time to 
eat and eased into the dining 
room. Each person followed the 
one in front, and all were soon 
seated uncomfortably, awaiting 
the arrival of other people, so that 
the banquet might begin.
Late Guests
Meanwhile, the speakers’ table 
remained half-empty. Be some 
unforeseeable accident, the seating 
arrangement at this table was 
such that every other person ar­
rived late—very late. As a result, 
the line of the evening’s celebri­
ties and honored guests took on 
the appearance of an adolescent’s 
mouth—rows of teeth interrupted 
by gaps, with each ooth leaning 
across empty spaces towards its
neighbors for consolation and 
moral support.
After the meal, Miss Clara Bar­
ton Herron, president of Pi Delta 
Epsilon introduced a number of 
including visitor Max Hannum, 
former publications advisor and 
head basketball coach.
The formalities were conclud­
ed, and Professor Robert X. 
Graham of the University of 
Pittsburgh was invited to lec­
ture after a satisfying introduc­
tion.
Publications Discussed
He commented acidly on year­
books in general (to the charm­
ing anguish of the Thistle’s Deanie 
Miller), praised the Tartan and 
added a few technical comments 
directed toward its improvement, 
and gave the Scottie its usual rap 
across the shins. He reserved his 
best, however, for the Carnegie 
Technical, which he lauded ful- 
somely, in complete and glowing 
detail.
The professor’s concluding re­
mark is worth quoting, as fol­
lows: “From the thirteenth floor 
of the Cathedral of Learning, I 
doff my hat to you.”
The valedictory words of Miss 
Herron are also worth repeating. 
Concluded Clara: “That’s all, kid­
dies. Now you can all go home 
and study like mad.”

ly for Delmar to arrive. Just as 
everyone was giving up hope, the 
versatile S&S crew saved the day 
by putting on their own show.
Ernie Motyl, A1 Checco, and 
Dave Crantz gave impromptu
skits that rocked the foundations 
of the building. Crantz’s Bob Hope 
jokes (examples censored) com­
pletely alleviated the disappoint­
ment caused by Claghorn’s non- 
appearance.
In case any disappointed fans 
care to send get-well-soon cards, 
the address is Senator Claghorn,

“Dance With Delight To Music 
By Knight” at Council Dance
Editorial
Evening student activities dur­
ing the present school year have 
been slowly building up to the 
point where they are approach­
ing those prevalent prior to the 
war. It has been the chief aim of 
the social committee of student 
council to enlarge the social as­
pects of evening school, so that 
more students can take part in 
them. This aim has a twofold 
purpose: one, it acquaints you 
with your fellow students; and 
two, it permits you to obtain some 
enjoyment during your school 
year. We want it to be definitely 
known that the purpose of these 
functions is not to make money 
for council, but to enable you, the 
students, to come and enjoy your­
selves. Any profit from these af­
fairs will be applied to other func­
tions so that their cost may not be 
prohibitive to you. We believe 
that with the same type of coop­
eration which you are giving this 
year, we can make next year a top 
one in the history of Tech Even­
ing School. The more you sup­
port these affairs, the better we 
will be able to make them, and 
the lower will be the final cost to 
you. So turn out if you can and 
enjoy them with your fellow 
classmates.
PiDE Scores 
With Banquet
Pi Delta Epsilon, national jour­
nalistic honorary, held its annual 
banquet at the Webster Hall hotel 
on Thursday, March 6. Clara Her­
ron was toastmistress of the high­
ly successful affair.
After an excellent dinner Clara 
introduced Dean Warden; Max 
Hannum, former publications ad­
visor, who spoke briefly of his 
present position and of his mem­
ories of Tech; Dean Yon; and Ed­
ward McDonald, advisor to Pi 
Delta Epsilon, who again pledged 
himself to aid student publica­
tions.
Following these, Clara present­
ed Professor Robert Graham of 
the University of Pittsburgh, who 
was the main speaker of the even­
ing. Professor Graham is a 
teacher of journalism at Pitt. He 
told of his past experiences in 
connection with engineering.
He stated that the Tartan needs 
a standard style sheet which all 
the writers would use. He com­
plimented the paper on its mod­
ern style but said that it should 
give more emphasis to future 
events because of its weekly pub­
lication.
Background of St. Patrick 
Full of Tales of Adventure
St. Patrick, patron saint of Ire­
land, was probably born about the 
year 389. The British name of the 
future apostle was Sucat, to which 
the modern Welsh ~ (hygad-war- 
like) corresponds. He was edu­
cated as a Christian and when 
about sixteen years of age was 
carried off by a band of Irish 
marauders. Irish tradition repre­
sents him as tending the herds of 
a chieftain by the name of Milchu. 
After six years bondage, he fled 
to the coast and boarded a ship 
engaged in the export of Irish 
wolf-dogs. After a sea journey of 
three days, he landed on the coast 
of Gaul. He wandered about with 
companions for about two months 
before entering the monastery at 
Lerins, where he remained for 
some years, after which he return­
ed home to Britain. While there, 
he claims to have had a vision 
of himself going as a victorious 
apostle of Christianity to the Ir­
ish. This he regarded as a divine 
call, and he went to Auxerre in 
Gaul, where after a period of 
study an preparation he was or­
dained a priest. His period of pre­
paration being over, he went as 
a misionary to Ireland where he 
toiled faithfully throughout his 
life.
Saint Patrick seems to have 
been a man of very strong will­
power and considerable ex­
ecutive ability. He must have been 
much of a diplomat to have 
achieved the success he did in the

midst of warring factions at a per­
iod when the power of druidism 
was very strong in Ireland. What­
ever may be doubtful about his 
life, therexan beno doubt that .he 
was a great organizer, and that 
his enthusiasm and his faith in 
his work inspired him to treat 
with kings and princes as though 
they had been put there for his 
purposes for the spreading of the 
Christian faith. He influenced 
strongly the Irish mind, and Celtic 
imagination has surrounded him 
with picturesque legends. He ban­
ished the snakes and toads out 
of Ireland; he performed the most 
astounding miracles in his con­
tests with the druid priests; he 
confounded hig enemies by bring­
ing down darkness upon them; and 
many equally wonderful things 
tradition credits him with doing. 
At his death so great was the glory 
that there was no night for twelve 
days.

of women who attend evening 
classes at Carnegie, will be held 
March 16 at the Carnegie Union 
at 3:00. It is anticipated that the 
first draft of the constitution will 
be read to the members for their 
discussion and remarks. For this 
reason it is important that all 
members be present at this meet­
ing. A musical program is plan­

to conclude the school term by 
planning another evening of fun 
for all of you.
Another popular Pittsburgh or­
chestra has been engaged for your 
entertainment, none other than 
Clyde Knight, a Clyde Knight, a 
genial maestro who has toured 
the local nite spots quite success­
fully for the past few years. No 
doubt many of you have heard 
and danced to his music so that 
you will realize that every effort 
is being made on our part to give 
you a good band for your dancing 
pleasure. One of his big features 
will be the singing of Mark Lewis 
who in our book tops all of the 
local male vocalists currently ap­
pearing local bands. If you 
haven’t heard him yet, it will pay 
you to plan on attending this af­
fair and judge for yourself wheth­
er or not he is all we claim him 
to be. In addition, there are thir­
teen other musicians who certain­
ly can put the tunes smoothly 
across the dance floor.
Remember now, we are count­
ing on you to help put this dance 
across. Get yourself a date and 
show up for the St. Patrick Dance, 
won’t you?
Tuition Change
An incorrect statement was 
printed in the last issue of the 
PLAID in regard to the recent 
tuition increases. The correct 
tuition rate rate for subjects 
in the E, GE, S, and GS class­
es is $5.10 per unit. Courses in 
general studies and Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College are 
$4.20 per unit. There was no 
change in the tuition rates for 
courses in the Fine Arts 
School.

of the Senate, declared LilienthaJ

“Red” Label Used Arbitrarily 
This bugaboo-under-the-bed 
frame of mind is a very unhealthy 
thing. The epithet “communist” 
is now being applied to worthy 
people, who are then not listened 
to because some rogue tabbed

communists, taking their orders 
from Russia, are as bad as Taft 
says, tout they are fortunately raxe, 
At present designing congressmen 
are pinning the label on their po­
litical enemies for selfish reasons. 
After all, if a congressman oan’t 
go hunt moose, he must look for 
“communists.” Why not give all 
congressmen a $10,000 salary raise, 
so that they can confine their 
nimroding to the woods?
