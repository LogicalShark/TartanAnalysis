President Doherty 
Speaks In London 
To Engineer Assn.
Dr. Robert E. Doherty, presi­
dent of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, has been selected to 
discuss American trends in engi­
neering education as a part of the 
observation of the Centenary of 
The Institution of Mechanical En­
gineers in London, England. His 
selection to take an active part in 
this celebration is a high tribute 
both to him and the standing of 
Carnegie Tech as an engineering 
school.
The Institution of Mechanical 
Engineers, which is the British 
counterpart of the American So­
ciety of Mechanical Engineers, is 
celebrating its 100th anniversary 
during the week of June 8th and 
will bring together a very distin­
guished group of American and 
European engineers and educators.
Dr. Doherty, accompanied by 
Mrs. Doherty, will sail from New 
York aboard the S. S. America 
on May 28 and will be abroad for 
about one month.
Drive Underway
Another annual Red Cross Fund 
drive is under way. Because of 
the end of the war, Red Cross ac­
tivities have been curtailed, but 
there are still many important 
functions which must not be for­
gotten. The goal in Pittsburgh is 
$1,143,000, 65% of last year’s quo­
ta.
The greater portion of this 
money will be used to benefit the 
two million men still in the armed 
forces, the thousands in military 
and veterans’ hospitals, and ex- 
servicemen and their families in 
distress. The many Red Cross 
health, education, and relief pro­
grams will require the balance of 
the fund. _ &
Scholarships
Upperclassmen wishing to 
to apply for scholarships for 
the summer semester or for 
the academic year 1947-48 
should file applications with 
Dean Dickinson, IH 152, by 
April 1, 1947.
Film Arts 
Gets Recorder
A complete sound-on-film re­
cording studio has been made 
available to the Film Arts club for 
use in their first production, Bill 
Dolonick, professional advisor to 
the group, announced at last 
week’s meeting of the steering 
committee. The equipment, locat­
ed at the U. S. Bureau of Mines, 
includes a Burton-Mars 16 mm 
sound-on-film recorder, micro­
phones and amplifying equipment.
The granting of permission to 
use this equipment means that 
plans for production of the club’s 
first movie, a short based on cam­
pus life at C.I.T., can now proceed 
at full speed. Bill Heller and Mar­
vin Kolatch, who have been work­
ing on the script for the film, are 
to present the complete scenario at 
this week’s meeting of the steer­
ing committee, and tryouts for 
parts will be announced soon 
thereafter.
The sound equipment at the 
Bureau of Mines is not portable, 
and it will be impossible to do any 
“on location” sound recording for 
the first production. Revision of 
their original plot to permit the 
production of a narrative film is 
now being completed by the two 
writers.
Two committee meetings for 
club members have been sched­
uled for this week. On Wednesday 
afternoon, March 5, the photogra­
phy and light committee will meet 
in room B, Carnegie Union, at 
4:30 p. m. On Friday, the art com­
mittee will meet at the same place 
and time. Anyone interested in 
working on either of these phases 
of the club’s activities is invited to 
be present, regardless of whether 
or not they have previously signed 
up for membership in the club.
Phil Pfleeger has been elected 
to serve as temporary president 
of the club until formal details 
of organization as provided by the 
constitution can be completed. 
Robert Abelson is temporary vice- 
president and chairman of the 
steering comjmittee, and Jane 
Ramsey is secretary.
Re-Exams
The starting date for day 
and evening class re-exams 
has been changed from March 
8 to March 15.
Motyl, Welch, Palmer Share 
Scotch and Soda Contest Prize
Ernie Motyl, Kenny Welch, and 
Howard “Champ” Palmer shared 
the $200 prize which Student 
Council awarded to the best script 
submitted for this year’s Scotch 
and Soda Show. The committee of 
judges, consisting of faculty mem­
bers, gave Ernie Motyl one hun­
dred dollars for his book, and the 
other half of the prize to Howard 
Palmer and Kenny Welch for 
their music and lyrics.
Contest First On Its Kind
The contest, the first of its kind 
ever to be held here, was spon­
sored by Student Council as an 
incentive to the successful revival 
of Scotch and Soda. The prize- 
winning music, and the book 
adapted by its author and Dave 
Crantz, will be used in Rock ’n’ 
Riot! The show will mark the 
revival of the famous Scotch and 
Soda shows of the past after a 
war-enforced lapse of five years. 
As the club returns to the stage 
this year, it does so with the in­
tention to rival and surpass other 
college shows of its type. Scotch 
and Soda boasts a wealth and di­
versity of talent which few col­
leges can match.
Performances Announced
The Executive Board of the 
Scotch and Soda club announced 
last week that Rock ’n’- Riot! 
would run for three performances 
in the Carnegie Music Hall. On 
Tuesday evening, April 29, the 
show will open for alumni and 
outsiders. The two student per­
formances will follow on Wed­
nesday and Thursday evenings. 
Through a special arrangement 
with the Spring Carnival commit-
IF Dance Held At 
William Penn Hotel
The Interfraternity Dance will 
be held this Saturday evening from 
nine until one in the main ball­
room of the Hotel William Penn. 
Brad Hunt will furnish the music.
Interfraternity Council, with so­
cial chairman Bud Teichmann 
showing the way, has gone all out 
to make their first formal dance 
of the post-war season one of the 
best social events of the year. The 
Council expects approximately 
750 couples to attend. All “Wan­
dering Greeks” are invited to at­
tend; those interested should con­
tact Dean Dickinson immediately.
In addition, many of the frater­
nities will have dinners prior to 
the dance and will wind up the 
evening with an early morning 
breakfast from 1:00 until 2:30 a. m.
Fred Waring Expresses Interest in S&S Revieiv
“Of course I have heard of 
Scotch and Soda, and I’m glad 
that it’s active again,” said Fred 
Waring as he was interviewed 
backstage after his successful con­
cert in the Syria Mosque on Sat­
urday afternoon. He added, “Col­
lege musical shows like Scotch and 
Soda are great fun for the cast 
and for the audience, and in addi­
tion they give talented young 
composers, writers, and actors in­
valuable experience. Many Of the 
best people in musical comedy to­
day received their start in one of 
the topnotch college shows.”
There is no one in the musical 
world better qualified to speak 
about such things than Fred War­
ing. Ever since his graduation 
from Penn State in the early 
twenties, and the quick recogni­
tion of his musical talent, he has 
been interested in aspiring young 
musicians. He always does every- 
ting he can to help them, and to-
day he is truly the foremost 
“angel” of popular music.
Mr. Waring spoke about his 
biggest single contribution to­
wards this self-appointed task, his 
Musical Workshop, started several 
years ago. This summer more than 
a thousand young people will be 
able to pick up some first-hand 
information about the factors that 
enter into the success of a band 
like Fred’s. They will be invited, 
in small groups, to join Fred War- 
ing’s orchestra for a week at a 
time, sitting in on all the rehear­
sals, the conferences with arrang­
ers and program committee and 
all the other backstage work that 
a big band requires. Before their 
eyes a simple tune will unfold in­
to a complete arrangement, and 
they will watch it grow, first in 
section rehearsals and then with 
the full orchestra, into another 
Hit Parade success.
This project is only a part of

Alpha Sigma Phi 
Plans Reactivation
Alpha Sigma Phi fraternity an­
nounced last week that it now 
has definite plans for the reac­
tivation of its Alpha Gamma 
chapter on the Carnegie Tech 
campus, according to Mr. John S. 
Wassum, president of the Pitts­
burgh Alumni council of the 'fra­
ternity.
The fraternity started on the 
’campus as the local, Iota Sigma 
Delta, in 1915, and became the 
Alpha Gamma chapter of Alpha 
Sigma Phi in 1924. The chapter, 
a victim of the economic condi­
tions prevalent in 1936, became 
inactive, and since that time it 
has retained its organization 
through its alumni.
Alpha Sigma Phi is well known 
in national fraternity circles and 
was recently in the interfraternity 
spotlight through consummating 
the consolidation of the national 
fraternity Alpha Kappa Pi with 
its organization. At present there 
are 48 active chapters of Alpha 
Sigma Phi as well as several oth­
ers which are being reactivated.
Any students at Carnegie Tech 
who are members of Alpha Sigma 
Phi from other schools, such as 
transfer students or veterans who 
were enrolled in other schools 
prior to entering the armed serv­
ices, are asked to communicate 
immediately with either Mr. 
Lawrence W. Ingold, 244 Sum­
mit Avenue, Pittsburgh, LI 
3796-M, or Mr. Hlarry W. Hos- 
ford, Robert Morris School of. 
Business, William Penn Hotel, 
Pittsburgh, AT 0922.
Movie Gives Lower Price
Reduced rates are being offered 
to students for the current produc­
tion, Henry V, which is now p lay­
ing at the Art Cinema. Price 
changes are: $2.40 now $2.00, $1.80 
now $1.50, $1.20 now $1.00. Those 
students who desire tickets should 
bring their money to Mrs. Talbert 
in the Public Relations depart­
ment, IH 246C.
The tickets are good for 2:30 
performances Monday through 
Friday, and 5:30 performances 
Monday, Wednesday and Friday. 
They are also good for six evening 
performances: all but Saturday.
Carnival Chairman 
Kills False Rumors
False rumors are flying, and 
the Spring Carnival committee is 
anxious that they should be 
grounded. Cloyd R. Mellott, gen­
eral chairman, after a meeting 
last Friday evening, made an ap­
peal to organizational heads to 
check with committee chairmen 
before changing any plans for 
Carnival participation.
Mr. Mellott said that it had 
come to the attention of the gen­
eral committee that various cam­
pus organizations which had 
planned participation in Carnival 
events had discontinued prepara­
tion on the basis of rumors that 
some events had been cancelled. 
He emphasized the fact that all 
events on the calendar have been 
retained.
One rumor which had gained 
impetus last week concerned can­
cellation of the float parade. The 
parade will take place as sched­
uled, and all organizations plan­
ning to enter floats should go 
ahead with their preparations.
In case any questions arise in 
connection with the Spring Car­
nival, the proper committee head 
should be consulted.
The committee chairmen of the 
Carnival events are:

WAA Sponsors Dance
The plaid-shirt mob is congre­
gating this Friday evening, March
7, in Thistle hall for a vigorous 
old-time square dance. Figures 
will be called by Si Braley, well- 
known Pittsburgh folk dance per­
sonality.
The dance will last from 8:30 
until 12:00, and the whole eve­
ning, complete with refreshments, 
costs only 50 cents per person. 
The members of the Women’s Ath­
letic Association, who are putting 
on the swing-your-partner party, 
will be selling tickets during the 
week on campus and Friday eve­
ning at the door.
Since this is the only square 
dance of the year on the school 
social calendar, it is hoped that 
there will be a large turn-out. 
Here’s a big opportunity for cou­
ples who like old-clothes dates 
and energetic evenings.

The Passing Parade
For the last forty years Europ­
eans, despite their admiration and 
envy of the U. S., have been re­
garding us as a nation of suckers. 
At levels high and low Americans 
were considered to be legitimate 
prey for legalized highway rob­
bery. American tourists, for in­
stance, were charged double the 
normal price for all their pur­
chases. And otherwise respecta­
ble European business firms and 
igoverments would conveniently 
forget about their American loans 
a few months after they were 
spent. “Americans are suckers” 
seems to have been the keyword.
What is hard to understand now 
is this: Why is the U. S. govern­
ment doing its darned best to re­
vive this state of mind? In the last 
few years the picture of the typ­
ical American—rich, foolish, and 
drunk — has been supplanted in 
European minds by the memory 
of our armed might and of our 
industrial potential. But it ap­
pears that we intend to assume 
the sucker role again. For this is 
American policy in the only Euro­
pean area occupied by our troops 
—Nazi Germany.
A few weeks ago General Jo­
seph T. McNarney, American 
commander in Jermany, proclaim­
ed an amnesty for 800,000 “little 
Nazis.” In a grand gesture of gen­
tlemanly philanthrophy, General 
McNarney showed that Americans 
are good sports. “You played us 
a good game,” he seemed to say to 
the little Nazis, “You fought a

OnSaleWednesday
The March issue of the Carnegie 
Technical will be on sale in Skibo 
and Industries hall from 10:30 to 
2:30 on Wednesday and Thursday, 
March 5 and 6.
This issue of the Technical, 
Carnegie Tech’s engineering and 
science., publication, will feature 
“Higher Engineering Mathemat­
ics” by Benjamin L. Schwartz, 
now an instructor in the depart­
ment of mathematics. In this ar­
ticle, Mr. Schwartz discusses some 
of the divisions of mathematics 
¦which the engineer missed after 
completing his mathematics train­
ing with the calculus. Each of 
these fields is outlined in brief, 
with examples of their applica­
tions being included for clarity 
and to illustrate to the practical 
engineer how higher mathemat­
ics is applied to his work.
Also featured in this issue is 
David L. Germain’s “Wage Incen­
tive Plans,” an article devoted to 
an examination of one of indus­
try’s most successful attempts at 
solving its worst modern prob­
lem—that of working properly 
with its employees.
Student
game war. Now dust off your 
pants, let us shake hands.”
How very touching! How typical 
of the all-too-quickly-passing code 
of the gentleman, which directs 
two boxers to shake hands before 
they come out punching. It is a 
pleasure to find the strongest 
country in the world engaging in 
such whole-souled benevolence.
Except for this:
Those 800,000 “little Nazis” 
were the backbone of Hitler’s sup­
port in Germany. They prolonged 
the war long after they realized 
that Germany was doomed, be­
cause they couldn’t face the con­
sequences of defeat. They had 
supported war policies—concen­
tration camps of unparalleled hor­
ror, sterilzation of “inferior races,” 
gas chambers, slave labor, the 
bombing of open cities, the starv­
ing of populations of surrounding 
countries. No wonder they feared 
the consequences of defeat. Well, 
they lost. And now they are fac­
ing the consequences: an amnesty, 
a clean bill of health from the 
erstwhile avengers of their crimes.
These “little Nazis” were not 
pardoned because the charges 
against them were trivial. The 
amnesty was based on the bank 
account. All who could show a 
bank account less than so many 
thousand marks got a clean slate. 
The lucky 800,000 are walking 
about now, dazed at the generosity 
of the American suckers.
Germany is not being purged of 
dangerous doctrines now, nor are 
the guilty being separated from 
the innocent. Take the testimony 
of Lt. Gen. Lucius Clay. He says 
de-Nazification is being used to 
“whitewash Nazis rather than to 
seek out and punish the guilty.” 
The trials are conducted entirely 
by Germans in special courts call­
ed “Sprachkammer.” Here scenes 
like this take place daily:
PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: I 
charge the defendant with sup­
porting the Nazi government, with 
actively participating in Nazi af­
fairs, with forcing his fellow cit­
izens to cooperate with the Nazis.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: What is 
wrong with that? Were the Nazis 
so very vicious?
PROSECUTING ATTORNEY: 
Of course they were evil and vici­
ous.
DEFENSE ATTORNEY: Well, 
how was the defendant to know 
that? The government of the U.S. 
liked the Nazis well enough to 
continue diplomatic relations with 
them almost to 1942. If the entire 
American nation didn’t know that 
Nazis were vicious, how could the 
defendant, a lone individual, know 
better?
On such pap as this people are 
persuading themselves that the 
world’s worst criminals should go 
unpunished. And thus, between 
the lines of amnesty proclama­
tions, the seeds of World War III 
are being sown.

Faculty Chaperons
Dear Editor:
I am writing in to voice the dis­
satisfaction of more than one 
member of the faculty with the 
way in which student dances are 
conducted. Lately the grumbles of 
a good many have reached my 
ears.
A graduate of Tech, now on 
the faculty, was sadly contrasting 
the way in which he and his fel­
low students had treated their 
chaperones with the way in 
which he and his wife were treat­
ed as “guests” at a student dance. 
Another teacher, who has been 
at Tech about twenty years, 
agreed that times and manners 
have changed. Ten years ago 
when a faculty member accepted 
an invitation to chaperone a stu­
dent dance, he and his wife knew 
that someone would call for them 
at their home. When they arrived 
at the dance, a reception commit­
tee would greet them and make 
them feel welcome. As the dean 
and other faculty members ar­
rived, they and the committee 
would form a receiving line for 
the first half-hour. After the 
dance, the faculty members would 
be taken home.
Now it is quite different. On the 
rright of a socially important 
dance, they were regarded with a 
suspicious air by the ticket taker 
and those about him, but were 
admitted. No one came to greet 
them. They wandered about, nod­
ding and smiling at unresponsive 
students. There was nowhere to 
sit down. Not until another fac­
ulty couple arrived did they feel 
that they belonged. At the con­
clusion of the dance, they shiver­
ed for awhile on a windy street 
corner and finaly walked home.

should not have the atmosphere 
of a hotel dance, where all are 
and wish to remain strangers. 
Students and teachers need to 
meet each other socially and to 
see each other at their best. A 
faculty member who has given 
one of his few free evenings to 
attend a student function and is 
treated as a gate-crasher has add­
ed reason to bewail the amenities 
of an earlier day. It is dishearten­
ing to both him and his wife to 
be shunned as pariahs.
A Disgruntled Faculty Member.
Scottie
Dear Editor:
As a poor engineer and a reader 
of the publication known as the 
Scottie, I have hailed with great 
joy the subtle rumors of a pro­
posed reorganization of said staff. 
Since my return to Tech over a 
year ago, I have felt that the pres­
ent thing referred to as the Scot­
tie was a definite disgrace as a 
publication of this institution, the 
only one in the United States to 
give a degree in printing. I would 
think that the Scottie, as is, would 
be a thorn in the side of the Print­
ing Department. Haven’t they 
done anything about it? Or is it 
that some of our talented printers 
have offered their services and 
have been kept out by incompe­
tent key-seekers? Judging from 
the results, I would think that 
there would be a lot of room on 
the staff for some people who 
have had training along the pub­
lishing and editing lines.
I have been anxiously awaiting 
the write-up of such changes, if 
any, in the Tartan. Couldn’t you, 
as the organ of school expression, 
give me some information on this 
matter?

Gordon H. Templin.

Scotch and Soda promises a 
musical comedy which will cause 
Carousel to blush. Oklahoma will 
close the awning in the surrey- 
with - the - fringe - on - top when 
Rock ‘n’ Riot! steps forth at the 
end of April, when Carnegie Tech 
will see music, dance and story 
put together the way it should be.
Les Stanford, stage manager, is 
the guy who has to do everything, 
know everyone, and be every­
where from now on until opening 
night. Already he has to keep 
track of more than seventy-five 
people actively preparing for this 
gala event.
Scotch and Soda’s director Lar­
ry Carra was present at the chor­
us rehearsals last Saturday after­
noon, watching Ruth Pivirotto 
and Jane Culp putting the boys 
and girls through their paces. Piv 
in black tights . . . The men re­
fused to leave and rehearsed for 
an extra hour. Remarkable devo­
tion to duty.
Last Friday Dick Hoch led the 
twenty-eight piece orchestra play­
ing Kenny Welch’s and Howard 
“Champ” Palmer’s catchy tunes— 
everything from a beguine to the 
blues. Phil Petrikin, Rene Orkin, 
and Herb Wilson rehearsed their 
solos, and again Director Carra 
was present, making suggestions 
in his soft-spoken manner.
George Wood is always laugh­
ing, but he laughed more than 
ever when he had his first glance 
at Ernie Motyl’s and Dave Crantz’s 
script. The authors were amazed. 
. . . George puts a double enten­
dre into their most innocent lines 
—they never knew that their 
script was that funny. Or did 
they?
MMCC Bulletin 
Pictures Campus
Many Tech students are feeling 
conceited after seeing their photo­
graphs ity the new M.M.C.C. pub­
licity bulletin. This bulletin is de­
signed to advertise the various 
features that Carnegie Tech offers 
and contains pictures of the stu­
dent symphony orchestra, football 
and basketball games, and students 
from all colleges on the campus.
The book is very up-to-date, and 
even freshmen will recognize 
themselves in shots on the hockey 
fields and at teas. WCIT fans will 
be pleased to find a picture of 
their station in action.
The splendid photography is one 
of the most notable features of the 
book. It depicts the campus, Schen- 
ley Park, and the city of Pitts­
burgh at their most beautiful sea­
sons. The bulletin will be of special 
interest to all those who enjoy 
seeing themselves and their friends 
in informal poses in the dorms, 
labs, and on the ever-picturesque 
“senior fence.”

Editor’s Armchair
Herewith an amplification of last week’s statement about 
our editorial policy: When we haven’t anything to say, we won’t 
say anything. Easy when you know how. Hence two “Letters 
to the Editor” in the editorial column in this issue.
We would like to hear from our readers about what they 
like and dislike in the “Tartan.” We’re beginning to think that 
nobody gives a damn about the “Tartan” either way. Most dis­
couraging. -
A number of little items we would like to mention, and may 
say more about in greater detail later: the number of rats 
around the campus, and we aren’t referring to our distinguished 
fellow students; we mean rats. The school has promised to see 
that something is done about a garbage disposal system that 
will get rid of the rats, but weather conditions have been holding 
up construction, while the rats have been making like rabbits. 
The house managers of the fraternities could help the situation by 
calling the school’s exterminator again and again until all the 
rats are killed. Secondly, women’s dorm regulations will be the 
t of “Campus Round Table of the Air” on WCIT to- 
it 7:30. Thirdly, it’s going to hurt us too, paying that extra 
lollars a semester, but the school has good reasons for 
raising tuition, so nothing can be done about it.

TUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
Soap Box Program Discusses 
United States-Russia Problem
“Can the United States and 
Russia be friends?” is the topic 
for this week’s “Soap Box of the 
Air” broadcast. The program, 
jointly sponsored by the Post- 
Gazette and station WWSW, is 
one of a series of discussions 
broadcast every Tuesday evening 
at 8:00 p.m. over station WWSW. 
The program for March 4 will be 
held as usual in the University 
Club auditorium on University 
place, opposite Soldiers’ Memo­
rial hall. The doors will be closed 
at 7:45 p.m.
C.I.T.’s representative on the 
affirmative is sophomore Mary 
Jane Werner. Mary Jane is a mod­
ern language and English major 
in the department of general 
studies in M.M.C.C.
The second delegate on the af- 
firmotive side is P.C.W.’s Betty 
Fleck. A senior history major, 
Betty is quite well known to Car­
negie students because of her par­
ticipation in intercollegiate Y.M. 
and Y.W.C.A. forums and other 
group meetings.
Opposing Miss Werner and Miss 
Fleck on the negative side will 
be Mary O’Keefe of Mount Mercy 
College and Morley Azorski of 
Pitt. Miss O’Keefe, a senior Eng­
lish major, is an active member 
of Mount Mercy’s debating club,
Art’s Magazine 
Form Aims At 
Arts Synthesis
A “Synthesis of the Arts” is the 
aim of the magazine, Form, to be 
published by the students of the 
College of Fine Arts. It will pre­
sent in pictorial and literary form 
the development of present-day 
art. Form is sponsored by the 
Beaux Arts Society.
The feature article of the first 
issue will be a detailed descrip­
tion of the steps in making the 
scale model automobile just com­
pleted by the senior industrial de­
signers. Articles of like nature 
will be written in the fields of 
architecture, music, sculpture and 
drama.
The date of publication has not 
yet been set, but two issues of the 
magazine are planned for this 
term. Ken Welch, the editor-in- 
chief, has announced his staff. 
The art editor is Martha Morrill 
and the managing editor is Bert 
Pollock. The details of produc­
tion will be handled by the busi­
ness manager, Scotty Yurchison. 
Jack Loftus will do the photo­
graphic work and Ernie Brown, 
the publicity.
Assistant editor is A1 Lehman 
of the drama department. The lit­
erary staff is composed of Bea 
Gibson, Gretchen Schmertz, Mar­
tha Slocum and Mildred Schmertz. 
The illustrations will be executed 
by Russ Kulberg, Louise Fay, and 
others.
Women’s Guild 
Plays Dance Host
One hundred couples weather­
ed the wintry blasts to luxuriate 
in a warm Hawaiian atmosphere 
last Saturday night, at the Wom­
en’s Guild dance. Tommy Car- 
lyn’s lads, backed by artificial 
moonlight and shadowy palms, 
played a varied program of rhum­
bas, fox trots, and jump tunes.
Many couples ignored the semi- 
formal specifications and came 
dressed informally. The program 
committee furnished multi-color­
ed Hawaiian leis, and they were 
used in varied styles, anything 
from a Caesar’s crowns to a 
weighty wristlet.
This dance saw the innovation 
of a new system of handling the 
crowd. Everyone was directed to 
one entrance, tickets were sold at 
a central point, and traffic was 
kept to a one-way flow. The APO 
group in charge of checking man­
aged to provide additional space 
for those desiring to leave their 
coat*, eliminating another freat source of —* -
the Maratine Forum. Mr. Azorski 
is a history major.
Dr. Robert D. Gregg, head of 
the Carnegie Tech history depart­
ment, will act as moderator.
During the first portion of the 
hour-long program each partici­
pant will present a short state­
ment of his views on the problem. 
The next ten minutes will be de­
voted to rapid-fire questions 
around the microphone. The last 
part of the broadcast will include 
questions from the floor specific­
ally directed at participants on 
the platform.
The student delegates who have 
participated in the past few pro­
grams are in general agreement 
that this forum of radio experi­
ence is a fine type of practice in 
public speaking. Carnegie stu­
dents who are interested in par­
ticipating in future broadcasts are 
urged to contact Public Relations 
Director Stanley March in IH 
264B, or .Dr. Gregg in MMCC 113.
Station WCIT 
Expands, Presents 
Morning Programs
Growing like a milk-fed puppy, 
WCIT is now definite competition 
for Pittsburgh’s commercial ra­
dio stations. WCIT now presents 
a morning program! This Thurs­
day, the morning “Clambake,” a 
collection of tunes “a la platter” 
and special reveilles more per­
sonalized than a good-night kiss, 
will compete with exploding 
breakfast cereals throughout Ski- 
boland. Just to make sure tha* 
no one gets up on the wrong side 
of the bed, the melodies on the 
“Clambake” will be the sweet­
est and the announcer’s voice will 
be at its softest.
Furthering its efforts to install 
a comprehensive schedule, WCIT 
presents a program this week to 
satisfy the most versatile of Ski- 
bo’s music critics. Now offering 
the scintillating and the sublime, 
WCIT, ixi addition to its nightly 
“Classic Hour” and its weekly 
“Jazz Program,” has engaged the 
Women’s Glee club to render chor­
al arrangements this Thursday at 
7:30 p. m.
This week’s “Roundtable of the 
Air” will discuss a potent ques­
tion: “Should Women’s Dormitory 
Regulations Be Revised?” Caro­
lyn Cook, Joanne Hipp, Dick 
Eschenbach, and Ernie Snoyer will 
conduct the discussion Tuesday 
evening.
Technical Finds 
Out-of-Town Fans
Students idly perusing their 
many campus publications often 
wonder audibly how the work 
done in this field at Carnegie 
Tech is received in other schools 
—if they even notice it.
Recently, the Carnegie Techni­
cal’s exchange editor, David Lide, 
while examining other college en­
gineering magazines, was aston­
ished to come across an article in 
one of them which looked vaguely 
familiar. Sure enough, “The En­
gineer and Patent Law,” the 
piece which stirred his curiosity, 
had been reprinted word for word 
by the Virginia Tech Engineer. 
Checking with features editor 
Paul Gibian, he was informed that 
permission had been granted by 
the Technical for reprinting this 
article—and was advised to ex­
amine that particular issue of the 
Virginia Tech Engineer a little 
further.
In a few minutes, Dave found 
Tech-Scribes, a feature based on 
the Techsperts page of the Tech­
nical. Included in this column 
was the following statement:
“Since no problems were sub­
mitted for this issue, we are print­
ing two problems submitted to 
the similar feature in the Carne­
gie Technical, together with their 
solutions, as an indication of the 
types of problems which are w* 
Geptsbls."
Library Hours
The Margaret Morrison Li­
brary will be open from 5:00 to 
7:00 on Tuesday, Wednesday,

This is an experiment, and 
a record will be kept of the 
number of students using the 
library during these periods.

CW-YMCA Tea 
Discusses WSSF
At a tea given jointly by
C.W.C.A. and Y.M.C.A. on Thurs­
day, February 27, representatives 
from 25 campus organizations were 
introduced to the meaning and 
needs of the World Student Ser­
vice Fund. The purpose of this 
meeting was to organize a drive 
for funds which is scheduled to be­
gin March 18 and continue through 
March 25. Carnegie Tech has been 
assigned a quota of $1,500 as their 
share of the $1,500,000 national 
goal.
Karl Bryn of Norway and Roe- 
lef Steyn of Holland, students in 
the College of Engineering, told 
the group about the sad plight of 
students in colleges and universi­
ties in \heir, countries. It was 
¦pointed out how these less-fortu- 
nate fellow-students can be aided 
substantially by the contributions 
of American students to WSSF.
Grad Rewarded
Bob Teasdale’s many friends on 
campus will be glad to hear that 
he has been selected by the Gen­
eral Electric Company to receive 
a Gerard Swope Fellowship be­
ginning in September, 1947. The 
fellowship carries a stipend of 
$1500 for two terms of full-time 
graduate work.
Bob was a staff member of the 
Tartan and Thistle, a singer in 
the Glee club, and secretary of 
the local chapter of the AIEE.

SKIBO SCRAPS
All right, so we’re back . . . 
so the Tartan is retrogressing. But 
we don’t like it any better than 
you do. It means that we have to 
spend our Sunday atfernoons on 
the telephone, prying bits of 
mildly scandalous information 
from publicity-shy BMOC’s.
The big news this week is the 
Women’s Guild Dance, and who 
was there with whom. From the 
thousands we culled these perti­
nent pairs; Bob Summers and 
Katie Humphries; the constant Ed 
Spires and Carolyn Knoblock, A1 
“Coconuts” Posternak and Nat 
Friedman, Sal Antieri with Mari­
lyn Allshouse, Ed Peetz with Shir­
ley “Cuddles” Sassano, John De­
winter and Sally Hutchinson, 
Chic Fowle and Gloria Bergman, 
John Sant with Wanda Schaeffer, 
Don Johnson and Peggy Maguire, 
Law McCabe with Andy Groomes, 
King Tikey and Jerry Sunseri, 
Jack Troy and Joan Byrn, Bob 
Postian with Jane McCann, Bob 
Carringer with Janet Adams, 
Theo Bean with Nan Zimmerman, 
Stuart Anderson Lee with Peggy
Jo Blair looking------in a white
strapless, Bill Pound and Garnet 
Samuels, and Lee Wiley with Em­
ily Barnes.
Social Notes From All Over: (a 
la New Yorker) (We should live 
so long) Rex Stephenson and 
Alice Skirpan honeymooning in 
the Southwest. . . . Pierre Aig- 
rain and his wife, the former 
Francine Bogart recently return­
ed from a short latter in New 
York. . . . Guess what happened 
to Abe Hopper when the car 
June R. was riding in ran out of 
gas in Schenley Park. . . . The 
Beta Sigs are creating a stupend­
ous clubroom and bar in French 
cabaret style, under the direction 
of A1 Lehman, who had experi­
ence in Paris. . . . Frank Clover
is about to marry Grace Becker. 
The Becker family will soon be 
withering away to nothing, judg­
ing from signs and portents, huh 
Dody? . . . We wonder how Lynn 
Morris snagged Dumbo Child’s 
harlem key chain. . . . Dar Ox 
is still covering up for a lost 
weekend to Vassar several weeks 
ago. . . . The Tau Delts now 
have Ten cars (Dirty Plutocrats), 
so they’re going to start a taxi 
service. . . . Jane Orr is a very 
wonderful girl. . .. . We under­
stand that Dick Herrmann and 
Ed Head have taken up modeling 
for the Post Gazette society page. 
... A certain psychology major 
has been trying all her theories 
on frustrated “Orson Welles” 
Knaak. ...
Querie of the Week: Just why 
does C.H. (Herron, Clara) carry 
a policeman’s whistle in her coat 
pocket???? . . .
A couple of Oil City boys are 
having quite a battle for the af­
fections of Betty Lou Henry: they 
are Ernie Sandberg and returnee 
Nick (BMOC ’43-’44) Reed. . . . 
Betas Martino, Minor, and Loom­
is had dates for the PCW open 
house. . . . Sally, Logan will soon 
be converted into another frus­
trated and neurotic Tech student 
if you don’t date him. . . . “Boris 
Stanford claims it’s more excit­
ing to kiss girl’s hands. . . . Ken 
Sheppley has recently lost a pin 
to an Ohio Gal. . . . Several vic­
tims in Scobel are convinced that 
the “Buzzin’ Bill’s Special” is 
more effective than sleeping pills.
. . . Cantini reports that this
weather is “hampering his opera­
tions.”
If you really want to keep post­
ed on current campus clambakes, 
listen to the new 7:30 a.m. presen­
tation on WCIT (plug). We thank 
you.
Pgh. Symphony 
Returns Home
Following its triumphant six- 
weeks tour, climaxed by six con­
certs performed for enthusiastic 
audiences in Mexico City, the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, 
under the direction of Fritz 
Reiner, resumes its regular series 
of concerts at Syria Mosque on 
Friday evening, March 7, and 
Sunday afternoon, Mlarch 9. Isaac 
Stern, who thrilled audiences here 
last season with his masterful 
performances, will appear as so­
loist in the Tschaikowsky Violin 
Concerto. For the major work on 
these programs, Dr. Reiner has 
selected the Brahms Symphony 
No. 2 in D Major. Also to be 
heard will be Lysistrata by Mo- 
haupt, which will be played for 
the first time anywhere.
Isaac Stern, who vigorously de­
nies that he was an infant prodigy, 
since he made his debut at the 
advanced age of eleven, is an 
adopted son of San Francisco, 
whither his parents brought him 
from Kriminiesz, Russia, at the 
age of one. He began his musi­
cal studies at six with the piano 
and two years later turned to the 
violin. The demand for his “mag­
nificent music-making,” in the 
words of the dean of music crit­
ics, Olin Downes, has carried him 
across the country and back an­
nually on the most strenuous of 
concert tours.
When he performs with the 
Orchestra on March 7 and 9, 
Stern will play here for the first 
time the Alard Guarnerious, 
which he acquired from the pri­
vate collection of Ralph Norton 
of Chicago, and which is valued 
at $100,000.
On Fraternity Row
Real cheesecake was on exhibit 
at the Beta house a few weeks 
ago when the boys highlighted 
their party with a contest for “The 
Most Beautiful Legs, 1947.” Holly­
wood needn’t worry, however, 
since competing legs were strictly 
male. Girls were judges, and the 
winner was presented with an in­
scribed shaving mug.
The Betas have just announced 
a group of pledges for the spring 
semester. They are Chuck Kauf- 
feld, Tom Kelso, Hal Loomis, Joe 
Lux, Herb Mathias, Phil Pfleeger, 
Dave Royse, Don Shaver, and 
Tom Woeber. The whole fraternity 
braved the snow and cold recently 
to hold a pin serenade for P.C.W. 
Wonder who was colder, the girls 
hanging out the windows, or the 
boys with snow up to their knees?
If anyone doesn’t know how im­
portant water is to modern so­
ciety, they should ask a TX how 
bad it was when the water line 
broke last week. The TX’s ex­
tend heartfelt thanks to the 
ATO’s for their kind hospitality 
in permitting the waterless ones 
to take showers in the neighboring 
house.
Latest Sigrma Nu pledges in­
clude Jim Huffman, Ernie Snoyer, 
Howard Back, Ed Shriver, Sal 
Antieri, Bob Carringer, Dave 
Murphy, and Don Rhiel.
Sigrma Nu’s “Orson Wells” 
Knaak, “Zombie” Colson, and 
“Slippery” J. K. O’Hare went 
slumming the other night. The 
fraternity is still wondering why 
Knaak took a street car home — 
alone.
The following Delts were in­
itiated last Saturday: George Wil­
liams, Bill Mills, Danny MacGil- 
vary, Earl L’Abbe, Roger Wiewel,
Don Herbert, Charles Hughes, Al­
lan Murphy, and Charles Pollis.
The best tunes of all were heard 
at a DU brawl, with Barry Evans 
MC-ing the Washington’s Birth­
day dance in a program featuring 
Herby Griggs and Chuck Koester 
on the saxaphone, Jim Gilmartin 
on the piano, Ed King making like 
a trombone player with a slide 
rule, and DG pledge Gloria Berg­
man singing sultry songs to the 
accompaniment of DG Rowie 
Knott.
The Tau Delts are limping 
around campus nursing their ach­
ing muscles after the unusually 
violent exercise of a snowball 
fight with the neighborhood chil­
dren last week. Wonder who won?
Betas, Phi Kaps 
Choose Officers
The Betas and the Phi Kaps, who 
held their elections after the other 
fraternity results had gone to 
press, have announced their offi­
cers for the spring semester.
For the Betas, Jack Pollock will 
serve as president; Carlo Martino, 
vice-president; Ray Hild, treas­
urer; Vernon Neubert, recorder; 
Clark Sloan, corresponding secre­
tary; Vince Prus, alumni secre­
tary; Ed Head, house manager.
The Phi Kaps elected Walter 
Ambrose, president; Walter Tice, 
vice-president; Ralph Simon, sec- 
retary-treasurer; John Herman, 
corresponding secretary; George 
Vranovich, recording secretary.
As the ATO’s have not yet held 
their elections, their officers will 
be announced in a later issue.

TUESDAY, MARCH 4, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN6
Lehigh Added To Football Schedule
Bowling Ends In 4-Way Tie;
Betas Dominate Basketball
The Strike League closed last Saturday with a crash of pins 
and when the lanes were cleared the results showed a four-way 
tie for first place with T.N.T., A.T.O., A.S.C.E., and Dorm Combine 
all on top.
Kunning hot and cold all season long, the A.T.O.’s found 
the range last week when the chips were down and beat Citcom 
in all three games. The A.T.O.’s were beaten by the A.S.C.E. 
last week and weren’t considered 
as having much of a chance but 
their fine bowling Saturday marks 
them as one of the teams that can 
take the playoff.
DeIt-3 Upsets Dorm Combine
A.S.C.E. came within five pins 
of winning the league title when 
they dropped a close game to 
T.N.T. 721-716. Despite this poor 
game the A.S.C.E. was able to 
come back and win two games, the 
final with a score of 867 pins.
The Dorm Combine, apparently 
certain of an easy match against 
the last place Delts, were the 
luckiest team of the day. After 
winning the first game by 32 pins, 
the Combine squeezed the Delts 
out by one pin in the second. In 
the final game the Delts rallied to 
the cheers of the A.S.C.E., T.N.T., 
and A.T.O.’s and managed to beat 
the Combine by fifty pins.
Splits Take Crown
The Splits, who only last week 
tied the Beta Sigs for top position 
in the Turkey League, won the 
league crown without a struggle 
by taking three games from the 
PiKA’s. At the same time the 
Beta Sigs, unable to keep up their 
early season pace, faded badly in 
their final fatch with the hard- 
rolling T.X.’s. After winning the 
first game by ten pins, the Beta 
Sigs were unable to find the strike 
slot and dropped the next two 
with a fight.
The results of last weeks bas­
ketball showed more games lost 
on a technicality than on the floor 
itself. Eight teams received a loss 
when they played with men who 
had not taken their physical as re­
quired. This oversight cost the 
Tau Delts, A.S.C.E., D.U.’s, Eman- 
ons, Hot Rocks, Dorm Combine, 
Grecian Tide and the Beta B team 
a victory.
Betas Beat T.N.T.
The Betas won their third 
straight victory of the season last 
week when they won a tough 
game from T.N.T. 32-29. In get­
ting past T.N.T. the Betas have 
now hurdled one of the toughest 
teams in the National league and 
should find little trouble for the 
rest of the season.
The Kappa Sigs stayed on top 
with the Betas by beating the 
winless A. S. C. E. easily 33-22, 
while in the other games in the 
national league the Tau Delts lost 
to Kilroy 31-19, and the Delts beat 
the Phi Kaps 28-15.
S.A.E. Undefeated
Without miuch effort, the 
S.A.E.’s took the T.X. B team 33- 
18 and remained on top of the 
American league with three vic­
tories and no defeats. At the same 
time the Hot Shots received their 
first defeat when the Beta Sigs 
nosed ahead in the final four min­
utes of play to win 30-27.
In the Federal League the T.X. 
A team continued on the merry 
way by beating the A.T.O.’s 40- 
22, while Citcom beat the Kappa 
Sig B team 49-25. At the same 
time the PiKA’s beat the combine 
38-18 and the Hot Rocks won 
out over the F.P.H.A. 39-32.
Titans Beat 
Skibos 68-54
Carnegie Tech’s basketball team 
journeyed to New Wilmington last 
Saturday night to assist West­
minster College in closing their 
home season. The Titans have not 
lost a game on their own floor 
since 1942 and this game was no 
exception as they trounced the 
Skibos 68-54.
The Titans got off to a fast 
start as they scored 18 points in 
the first quarter as compared to 
Tech’s 7 to build up a comfort­
able lead. They kept right on go­
ing in the next stanza to score 25 
more and it looked as though the 
Tartans were not going to offer 
much resistance when they walk­
ed off the floor at the end of the 
half with the score standing at 
43-14.
However, when they came back 
on. the floor they looked like an 
entirely different team. They fin­
ally got hot and outscored the 
taller Titans 23 to 8 in the third 
quarter. The spurt was short lived 
though, as the Skibos could do no 
better than hold their own in the 
final stanza and the game ended 
with Westminster in control.
Mike Theodore and Leo Clough- 
erty did the majority of the scor­
ing for Tech as they led their 
teammates with 16 and 12 points 
respectively.

Tartans Score First Again 
But Waynesburg Wins 54-32
Trying for their third victory of the year, the Tartan basket - 
eers engaged the strong Waynesburg Yellow Jackets last Wed­
nesday night at the Tech Gym. But instead of their third vic­
tory they had to be content with their 14th defeat as they were 
trounced by a score of 54-32.
Displaying ragged passing and poor shooting, the Scots were 
able to threaten only once throughout the game. That came in the third quarter, the only period in------------------------------------------------

Femmes Win 
Close Game
The women’s vaisity basketball 
team of Carnegie Tech made its 
first appearance of the season on 
the floor at Mount Mercy last 
Wednesday, February 26. The 
close contest ended with Tech on 
top 16-15.
The C.I.T. team, sponsored by 
the Women’s Athletic Association, 
made the home team ¿;&sp in the 
first seconds of play by intercept­
ing the first Mt. Mercy pass. With 
two rapid passes the ball traveled 
to Ella Baum, who sank it for the 
first score. This action was quick­
ly repeated on the next throw-in 
with Betty Coble on the shooting 
end.
The Tartan lead melted away 
by the end of the first quarter and 
after that the score was close until 
the end of the game.
The Tech team has been sparked

which they outscored their oppo­
nents, when they sliced a 10 point 
deficit in half to bring the score 
to 25-20. But they couldn’t keep 
it up and the visitors put on a 
rally to win going away.
Tech Scores First
Tech followed the usual pat­
tern as they opened the game by 
scoring first. Tasso Katsellas 
dribble up the middle to cage a 
lay-up and give the Tartans their 
biggest lead of the night. Leo 
Clougherty then fouled the 
Jackets Gjurich and when he 
made the charity and followed it 
by a field goal, the visitors were 
out in front. For the remainder 
of the quarter Tech could collect 
only 2 more field goals, both by 
Clougherty, as Waynesburg got 
five to give them a respectable 13- 
6 advantage.
Mike Theodore opened the next 
stanza with a free throw but the 
only other points that the Skibo’s 
could get for the rest of the half 
were 2 fouls and a field goal by 
Clougherty. The Yellow Jackets 
could not do much better as they 
garnered 3 fielders and two char­
ities to stretch their lead to 21-11

Swimmers Beat 
Kent U. Easily
The Carnegie Tech swimmers 
won their fourth meet of the sea­
son last Saturday when they eas­
ily defeated Kent State Univer­
sity by the score of 48-27. The 
meet was never in doubt as the 
Tartan took seven firsts in the 
nine events. The only double win­
ner of the day was Tech’s Herb 
Venzer, with victories in the 50 
and 100 yd. free style contests. 
Other Tech firsts were Schroeder, 
Ferguson and Luckey in the 300 
yd. medley relay, Spangler in the 
220-yd. freestyle, Stu Lee in the 
diving, Penfield in the 150 yd. 
back-stroke and Zoller in the 200 
yd. breastroke.
The swimming team brings its 
season to a close next Saturday at 
2:00 P. M. in the Tech pool when 
it entertains Westminster, Kent 
State and Slippery Rock in the 
Penn-Ohio Championships. No ad­
mission will be charged.
The Results:

Tartans Drop 
Major Foes
Tech de-emphasis is now com­
plete. The football schedule for 
1947, just released by Buddy 
Overend and approved by the ath­
letic board is composed ¡er.tirely 
of teams in the same class as the 
Skibos and should produce a 
much better quality of competi­
tion for the coming season.
The Schedule:
October 18—West Virginia Wes­
leyan—Pittsburgh.
October 25 — Geneva — Pitts­
burgh.
November 1 — Washington and 
Jefferson—Washington, Pa.
November 8—Case—Cleveland.
November 15 — Lehigh — Pitts­
burgh.
November 22 — Grove City — 
Pittsburgh.
The original schedule contain­
ed Oberlin, the game to have been 
played October 11, but because of 
the fact that school will start 
only a week before it v/as felt that 
it would be impossible to have 
the team in condition and the con­
test was called off.
In adding Lehigh to the sched­
ule, a 4 year contract has been 
signed, renewing a series that 
started in 1907 and had been dor­
mant most of the time since. Of 
the 4 games to be played, 2 will 
be here in ’47 and ’49 and the re­
maining 2 at Lehigh in ’48 and ’50. 
To date Tech has won once, tied 
once and lost 7 times. The last 
game played was in 1943 when 
the teams played to a 0-0 tie. 
Prior to that, the last contest had 
been in 1925 when Tech won by 
a score of 37-0 and it was decided 
to terminate the series because the 
Skibos had become too strong.
In conjunction with this an­
nouncement, Mr. Overend declar­
ed that a contract has been signed 
with Franklin and Marshall for 
a two game home and heme series 
to begin in 1948. The teams have 
played twice to date, Tech win­
ning both games by scores of 11- 
5 in 1909 and 18-6 in 1940. It will 
be remembered that F&M is now 
the home of MJax Hannum, Tech’s 
former basketball coach and pub­
licity director.

THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, MARCH 4, .947
|>ne of thf3QYS
We walked into Skibo; we no­
ticed a crowd. In the center of 
that crowd there he was — Bob 
Straka. Bob, as everyone on cam­
pus knows, is a senior in the 
chemical engineering department. 
He is characterized by the three 
W’s—vim, vigor, and vitality.
When we asked him about his 
activities, Bob, who has a rather
short memory, pulled out a list 
and handed it over. He is a mem­
ber of the pledge tribunal in Delta 
Upsilon fraternity; publicity di­
rector of Spring Carnival; a mem­
ber of Theta Tau, Tau Beta Pi and 
Omicron Delta Kappa; and is 
vice-president of Y.M.C.A.
The list of his past activities is 
also rather impressive. He has 
been president of Delta Upsilon, 
Student Council, Delta Skull, and 
the Newman club. He was treas­
urer of Tecvets, secretary of 
Y.M.C.A., chairman of the Presi­
dent’s Student Conference Com­
mittee, and a member of the Rules 
and Regulations committee. He al­
so participated in varsity swim­
ming, for which he sports a “C” 
and numerals. Here we pause for 
breath.
Bob started in at Tech in August 
of 1943, but took a three month’s 
Christmas vacation in the Navy 
V-12 program at M.I.T. What
Senior Girls Visit 
Pgh. Women’s Clan
The present senior class of Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie College 
and the senior girls in the College 
of Fine Arts will be guests of the 
Pittsburgh Women’s Clan at a 
party in Carnegie Union, on Thurs­
day evening, March 13, at eight 
o’clock. Dr. Norman H. Dawes 
will be the speaker and refresh­
ments will be served. The party is 
an annual event of the program of 
the Clan, the organization of Pitts­
burgh alumnae of Carnegie Tech, 
at which the seniors, soon to be­
come alumnae themselves, have a 
chance to get acquainted with the 
group.
Mrs. M. W. Kiebler, Jr., chair­
man of the committee in charge 
of the party, has asked members 
of the faculty and administration 
who are alumnae to serve on the 
committee with her. They are 
Mrs. G. B. Kimberly, Mrs. R. W. 
Marshall, and Misses Doris My­
ers, Grace Patterson, Ellenor Tall- 
madge, Helen Topp, Dorothy Stew­
art, and Miriam Weikert.
Miss Eleanor Riesmeyer is presi­
dent of the Clan and Mrs. Her­
bert J. Graham is membership 
chairman.

Tech’s attraction was we can only 
guess, but in April he was back 
at the old Alma Mater.
When he has time, Bob likes to 
hunt small game, fish for pan 
and game fish, and sail. Whether 
he has time or not, Bob goes in 
for photography and discussion.
Bob’s favorite discussion group 
consists of a guy from Michigan, 
a guy from Duquesne, and, of 
course, himself. They talk about 
life, maturity, women, true edu­
cation, culture, women, philoso­
phy, happiness, love, and women. 
Bob’s only complaint is that while 
they are analysing the women 
they’re dating, and would like to 
date, some dull tool (who doesn’t 
waste his time thinking), dates, 
pins, or rings the girls they are 
talking about.
In the pet peeve department 
Bob is practically negat. He is 
slightly bitter because there are 
only twenty-four hours in one 
day. Most mornings come about 
four hours too soon to suit him. He 
doesn’t care for people who mean 
to but don’t use their intelligence 
or energy to remedy their peeves.
After he graduates, Bob ex­
pects to work in either sales or 
production. In fact, he is even 
taking golf lessons since he heard 
that all big executives take after­
noons off to play the game. He 
wants to start off with a training 
program in some large industrial 
corporation so that he may get a 
better idea of industry and his 
place in it. So far no company has 
offered him these items along with 
a substantial salary, but he is still 
hoping. Judging from his past 
records, however, we think he will 
tie up a satisfactory combination 
of both.
Playhouse Shows 
Modern Macbeth
The much heralded production 
of Macbeth currently being pre­
sented at the Playhouse, is one of 
the most unusual of the local the­
ater’s productions.
The Elizabethan masterpiece 
was originally presented in 1606 
but Director Frederick Burleigh 
has not allowed the play’s anti­
quity to influence his presentation 
on the Playhouse stage.
He has costumed his actors in 
modern battle uniforms and mod­
ern Colt 45’s have replaced the 
traditional sabre in the hands of 
Shakespeare’s men of war. Bur- 
. leigh has given the w*hole produc­
tion a slick modern streamlining, 
which places the emphasis on the 
dramatic story.
This rapidly paced, exciting 
production will be on view at the 
Playhouse through March 8.

Carnival Includes 
Canoe-tilt Race
Panther Hollow Lake will echo 
with the clash of spears and the 
“kerplunks” of splashes during the 
canoe-tilting meet to be held there 
Spring Carnival weekend. Rules 
for the soak-provoking tournament 
were approved at last week’s 
general Carnival committee meet­
ing, according to Willis Boothe, 
chairman of the event.
Each team will consist of two 
men, a spearsman and a paddler. 
The spreasman must stand ere^t 
in the canoe at a point from four 
to seven feet behind the bow. His 
weapon will be a long pole, well- 
padded on the end, to be used to 
dismount his opponent. A team is 
victor if both members remain 
afloat with the spearsman in his 
standing position when (1) either 
member of the opposing team has 
gone overboard, or (2) three fouls 
have been declared against the 
opposing team, or (3) if the op­
ponents’ canoe is swamped.
No organization may enter more 
than two teams. The tilting champs 
will be determined by eliminations, 
two heats taking place simulta­
neously. Canoes and spears will 
be furnished by the committee and 
life guards will be on duty to see 
the C.I.T. does not lose any po­
tential tuition sources during the 
fray. Entries for the event, which 
will be staged Saturday morning 
on May 3, beginning at 10 a. m. 
must be in the chairman’s hand 
by April 1.
What's Wrong?
By Bob Johnson and Nick Reed
(This is the first of a series of articles by Bob Johnson and Nick Reed on the subject of school spirit and other topics of general reader interest—Ed.)
’Twas a bright, sunny day in 
Pittsburgh. Children were laugh­
ing and playing in the streets. 
But there was no joy at Skibo. 
Three thousand zombies stalked 
about the grounds with bridge 
hands gripped in their fists, mut­
tering blissfully, “I flunk,” in­
stead of “I pass.” Nobody seemed 
to know or care that the once 
mighty Tartan eleven had just 
fallen in defeat to the Schenley 
High JV’s for the fifth consecutive 
year.
Could it Happen here? Perhaps 
the above is an exaggeration, but 
it cannot be denied that times are 
bad at Tech—and they don’t seem 
to be getting any better. A good 
many of us, returning to the cam­
pus after an absence of two to 
three years or more, have been 
amazed at, on one hand, the lack 
of school spirit, and on the other 
hand, the great concern shown by 
everyone, students and adminis­
tration alike, about the matter. In 
other words, everyone is talking 
about it, but nothing seems to be 
done about it.
Just what do we mean by 
“school spirit”? Well, it’s that 
will-o’-the-wisp quality of a cam­
pus that seems to give it an air of 
aliveness, of spirited activity, of 
great interest on the part of the 
student body and faculty in every­
thing that goes on around the 
campus—a certain something that 
Tech just doesn’t have.
Well, why doesn’t Tech have 
any school spirit?
We truly would like to know. 
Let’s not dodge the issue by blam­
ing the administration and letting 
it go at that. The question is of 
more fundamental import than 
that, and the answer doesn’t lie in 
superficial generalities. There al­
ready exists a plethora of misin­
formation, and every arm-chair 
BMOC has a hare-brained scheme 
for the revival of student morale. 
Before attempting to evolve a 
blueprint for spirit betterment, 
any investigator should obtain a 
core sample, so to speak, of all the 
various strata of unintegrated 
opinions and facts concerning this 
vast subject. Only then can an 
intelligent solution be worked out 
through discussion and compro­
mise.
Again, we would like to know 
what it is that ails our Tech spirit, 
and what can be done to put some 
life into the campus. We’re inter­
ested in getting the answers and 
putting them to work. Are you?

Tuition Increase Announced 
For Evening College Students
The Registrar’s Office of the Evening Colleges has annaurced 
that the increase will affect all students who are attending classes in 
the Evening Schools.
Following are the increases which will take effect in the Fall 
semester of 1947. For all subject numbers preceded by “E;” “GE,”

Spring Attendance
It is interesting to note that the 
evening school registration has 
gone into its customary mid-year 
slump. In the engineering depart­
ment there were 800 students reg­
istered for the first semester, 
whereas there were only 768 reg­
istered for the second semester. 
Six hundred and fifty of these 
were former students.
There were 328 students regis­
tered for the first semester in the 
arts department while only 305 
were recorded as registered for 
the second semester. Of these, 63 
v^re former students. This shows 
that the arts department regis­
tration is on the increase.
In the school of general studies 
223 students were registered for 
the first semester while 108 were 
registered for the second semester. 
As 30 of these students were for­
mer students, it is evident that 
the general studies registration is 
increasing.
The evening school registered 
1181 students for the second se­
mester; 970 of these were former 
students. This makes a total of 
211 new students entering the 
evening school during the sec­
ond semester.
After spending many months in 
destruction, a few Pittsburgh vet­
erans are learning how to re­
build. These veterans are a group 
of 21 who are employed in archi­
tectural offices in the greater 
Pittsburgh area and are taking a 
special architectural courses at 
Carnegie Tech evening school.
Harvey Schwab, chairman of 
the Committee on Education of the 
Pittsburgh chapter, and Raymond 
Fisher, president of the local 
architects’ unit of the A.I.A., or­
ganized the training program with 
Ernest Brown, director of Reha­
bilitation and Training, Pitts­
burgh Veterans Administration, 
in co-operation with the architect 
employers of the 21 veterans.
Total time spent in service by 
these Carnegie student architects 
amount to over 42 years. Nearly 
all of the group were in the hot­
test engagements of land and sea 
during the recent war.
Worst war experience suffered 
by any of the class was that en­
dured by Carl Noldovan, 24 year 
old former member of a dive 
bomber squadron, who spend sev­
eral years of his four and one- 
half years in the AAF in a Jap­
anese prison camp after ntaking 
the “death march” from Bataan. 
In Japan, Carl was alternately 
worked, beaten, tortured, and 
nearly starved. When liberation 
came he was able to speak Jap­
anese. Carl is a resident of New 
Brighton, where he is employed 
by the. firm of J. E. and A. L. 
Martsolf, architects.
Then there is Anthony Valecko,
22, home and at school after two 
years and nine months as an in­
fantry rifleman, who went through 
the D-Day invasion only to be 
captured and spend nearly a year

New Play To Be 
Bard’s King Lear
Following their long established 
policy, the Drama ts this month 
will present King Lear as this 
year’s Shakespearean production. 
Performances will be given be­
ginning March 12 to March 24 in 
the Little Theater.
The play, one of the Bard’s bet­
ter known tragedies will be di­
rected, as in the past, by Professor
B. Payne of the Drama Depart­
ment of the University of Texas 
who returns annually to Carnegie 
Tech to assume this duty.
These offerings have always re­
ceived much favorable comment 
and we feel sure that this year, 
as always, a worthy perform­
ance will be seen. Tickets are 
now available in Mr. McKelway’s 
Office, I.H. 132-B.
in a German prison camp. 
Anthony, whose home is in Port 
Vue, Pa., is married and is doing 
drafting for the G. C. Murphy 
Co., of McKeesport.
One of the survivors of the old 
U.S.S. Lexington, the aircraft car­
rier which went to the bottom in 
the battle of the Coral Sea is Rob­
ert Marks, former boatswain’s 
mate, who went over the side 
when the big carrier breathed her 
last. Bob was picked up by a de­
stroyer escort.
After serving four years in the 
Pacific, Atlantic and European 
theaters, Bob received his dis­
charge and returned to Pittsburgh, 
where he resides with his wife 
at 606 Redknap Street. He is as­
sociated with Wesley Joseph Hen- 
ger, local architect.
Charles Kingan, of Greensburg, 
a veteran of four years with the 
Ninth Air Force, completed 42 
bombing missions over European 
battle areas; was wounded and 
spent some time in an English 
base hospital.
Not to be outdone by his stu­
dents of the architecture group, 
Roy Patterson, instructor of the 
class, is himself a veteran of both 
world wars. Mr. Patterson, a 
member of Palmgreen, Patterson
& Fleming, Pittsburgh architects, 
comjmanded a sub-chaser in WQrld 
War I and served as a commander 
in the Navy’s Civil Engineer Corps 
during the recent hostilities.
These men have indeed seen 
much destruction, suffering, and 
heartache during the war. Now 
they are learning how to build. 
We wish them all God speed in the 
work as they strive to create a 
better and safer America of To­
morrow.
The aftermath of the dance has 
left our Clem in sad shape, and 
I’m still recuperating. And to 
think that the loud whispering has 
started about another dance the 
Saturday following St. PatJs day 
. . . Who threw the overalls in 
Mrs. Murphy’s chowder? Don’t 
know! But Clem done pulled the 
cord out of the microphone when 
the vocalist was in the middle of 
her number at the dance last Sat­
urday . . . P. M, Brannen is pon­
dering over many a quaint and 
curious volume currently—study­
ing entropy. Last night Paul found 
out there was something screwy 
connected with it, viz. enthalpy? 
Norm’s definition—when a fellow 
and a girl get together and the 
fellow puts his arm around the 
girl — that’s where entropy comes 
in—That’s his definition not ours 
. . . Warning! Never cross Ches 
when there’s a phone book around. 
He tears them . . . Whoo! This 
happened while under the in\u- 
ence of Elsie and Anne . . . And 
now one of the local electrical 
wizards claims that the terms 
inebriation and capacitive react­
ance are synonymous. Well, ine­
briation certainly is, anyhow . . .
I saw her in the distance and on 
her it looked . . . We are pleased 
to report that Frank Mihelic act­
ually understands the architecture 
of the gym building. Frank can 
get to any place in the building in 
three hours. (Directions sent free 
on request—enclose ten dollars to 
cover cost of packing and mailing) 
. . . Judging from the worried 
countenance on Mrs. States (at 
the G. W. dance) Little William 
must have been a handful . . . 
Inscription observed on a lamp­
post—“Fido was here.” . . . Why 
does George B. try to act hard- 
boiled? . . . Johnny, our local 
artist, had a wonderful time 
throwing ideas together for dec­
orating Thistle Hall for the dance. 
He didn’t do bad what with Rose­
mary and Anne as models . . . 
Overheard from one of the in­
structors—after discussing present 
teachers’ wages, “We don’t make 
much money but we have a lot of 
fun” . . . All was quiet Friday 
night in the P&D Department be­
cause “Pop” Worner wasn’t there!

Evening School 
Dance Successful
Writing about the George Wash­
ington Birthday Dance is turning 
out to be a really soft job, for 
the success of the affair is in­
spiration enough for turning out 
words of praise for the dance. 
Tommy Carlyn’s orchestra lived 
up to all the fine praise the dance 
committee gave him in advance. 
Thistle Hall was decorated in an 
appropriate manner for this occa­
sion. The Black Cat was opened 
for that pause that one needed 
for refreshments. All in all the 
dance was a great success and is 
a sign that Evening School is back 
in the social groove.
Plans, for the next dance, which 
is going to be held Saturday eve­
ning, March 22 are taking form, 
and here’s hoping that it will be 
an even greater success.
Tartans Score
[Continued from page 5] 
promised to get completely out of 
hand.
Tartans Close Gap
After the half time rest the 
Tartans started off as though they 
meant to win as Clougherty and 
Mel Klein sank two successive 
set shots. But Karmonovich and 
Jones duplicated the feat for the 
visitors and the 10 point gap was 
restored. Chetlin then batted in 
a rebound, Reihl followed with a 
free throw and Theodore caged a 
pivot shot to bring the score to 
25-20. But the Jackets righted 
themselves and outscored the 
Tartans to bring the score to 30- 
22 at the end of the quarter.
In the final stanza, Waynesburg 
made 10 field goals to only 4 for 
Tech to pull steadily away. By 
the time the final whistle blew the 
visitors had fallen jut one point 
short of duplicating the trouncing 
they gave the Skibos on their 
home floor, the first score having 
been 55-32.

This increase is not as great as 
that of the day schools, and all the 
veterans who are taking courses 
under the G. I. Bill should inves­
tigate the number of semesters to 
which they are now entitled under 
the new rate. The revised sched­
ule of rates has been based on an 
average load of 100 units per year 
for a student. The cost of educa­
tion was then pro-rated on this 
average. This increase may seem 
great, but we should realize that 
the cost of educating each student 
is far greater than the tuition 
which he pays and that the Insti­
tute is still assuming a large part 
of this cost.

this year by the addition of four 
freshmen—Ella Baum, Elaine So­
bol, Dot Romito, and Peggy Shupp 
— and two transfer students — 
Rosemary DeBortoli and Betty 
Coble. Zone guarding, an innova­
tion this season, has also helped to 
improve the team play.
High scorer in this game was 
Elaine Sobol with four foul shots 
and two field goals for a total of 
eight points. Ella Baum put on a 
good performance that showed up 
in the score book as two field 
goals and one foul shot, for five 
points. Betty Coble and Joan Lowe 
completed the team total with two 
and one points respectively.
Other girls who played were 
Genevieve Norwood, Peggy 
Brown, Audrey Wilkins, Alice 
Haggerty, and Carol Kirch.
The good form showed by the 
Techites in the opener promises 
interesting games to come during 
the rest of the season. To date two 
other games are pending: Pitt at 
Tech, Tuesday, March 4, and Mt. 
Mercy at Tech on Tuesday, Mlaroh

Ellis Arnall, R. A. Taft 
Speak In Pittsburgh
Ellis Arnall, ex-governor of 
Georgia, and Senator Robert A. 
Taft of Ohio will be the two 
speakers to address the Pittsburgh 
Civic Center Forum in March. Sen­
ator Taft, who is chairman of 
both the Republican Steering com­
mittee and the Senate Labor com­
mittee, will speak on March 29 at 
the Soldiers and Sailors Memorial 
Hall.
Ex-Governor Arnall, whose vis­
it to Pittsburgh is especially time­
ly in view of the political battle 
ranging in Georgia over his suc­
cessor as governor, will address 
the forum on Tuesday, March 18, 
at Syria Mosque.
Following the formal speech 
the audience will be permitted to 
direct controversial questions to 
the speaker for extemporaneous 
response. This feature of the for­
um invariably provokes plenty of ‘ 
verbal fireworks and, in many in­
stances, clarifies major issues of 
the discussion. Mr. Irving Murray 
is the forum moderator.

Dr. Schild Wins Fred Waring 
Jewett Fellowship
The American Telephone and 
Telegraph Corporation has just an­
nounced the award of a Frank B. 
Jewett fellowship to Dr. Alfred 
Schild of the mathematics depart­
ment at C.I.T. The award carries 
an annual stipend of $3000 to the 
holder and $1500 to the institu­
tion at which he elects to do his 
research.
Dr. Schild studied at the Uni­
versity of Toronto, where he re­
ceived his bachelor’s degree in 
1943 and his doctorate in 1946. 
As a Jewett Fellow, he* will in­
vestigate relativistic field theories 
in quantum mechanics.
Prof. Robert Maurer 
Writes for Britannica
Robert J. Maurer, associate pro­
fessor in the physics department of 
C. I. T., prepared a new article 
on photoelectricity for the 1947 
revised printing of the Encyclo­
pedia Britanica. Professor Maur­
er teaches courses in atomic phy­
sics, light and electricity and mag­
netism in the College of Engineer­

the work Fred Waring has done in 
the realm of musical education. 
He has long been recognized as an 
expert in this field. On March 6, 
for example, he will address the 
convention of the National Edu­
cators’ Association at Atlantic 
City on this subject. Fred is very 
enthusiastic about choral work, 
another phase of music in which 
he has been very influential. It is 
he who was mainly responsible for 
the inclusion of choral groups in 
most of the recent successful 
Broadway musicals. Many years 
ago he organized and for a 
time directed the now famous 
Collegiate Choir in New York. His 
place was taken by a Waring 
alumnus, Robert Shaw, who still 
keeps in close contact with Fred. 
Together they “sold” choral music 
to Broadway, where by now it is 
well established.
Fred Waring’s season lasts 
twelve months every year, and 
since he began his daily, broad­
casts more than fifteen years he 
has not taken a vacation. For most 
people directing a orchestra would 
alone be a full time occupation; 
Fred does that, his educational 
work, and his campaign for choral 
music, and on top of all this he
still finds time to continue as a 
major hobby what once he intend­
ed to be his profession. He grad­
uated from Penn State as an 
architectui al engineer, and he has 
never lost interest in that field. 
Only a few years ago, for exam­
ple, he completely redesigned the 
big Shawnee Country club in the 
Pocono Mountains. In a way it is 
even surprising that he went into 
music at all, for at Penn State 
he tried out for the Glee club and 
was not accepted. The faces up 
there are still red when that is 
mentioned.
