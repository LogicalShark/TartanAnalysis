Pennsylvania Supreme Court rejects map as unconstitutional
LYDIA GREEN
Staffwriter
Last Monday after-
noon, the Pennsylvania 
Supreme Court ruled that 
Pennsylvania’s congres-
sional district map, which 
was approved in 2011, vio-
lates Pennsylvania’s state 
constitution. In this case, a 
group of Pennsylvanians, 
including the League of 
Women Voters of Pennsyl-
vania, has sued the Com-
monwealth of Pennsylvania 
claiming that the map was 
created by Republicans to 
sti?e the voice of Pennsyl-
vania Democrats in an at-
tempt that “strikes at the 
foundation of representative 
democracy.”
The petitioners argued 
that the congressional map 
employs the gerrymander-
ing methods of “packing” 
and “cracking,” meaning 
that the map was seemingly 
drawn to pack Democratic 
voters into just a few dis-
tricts while cracking the rest 
of the Democratic electorate 
into pieces throughout the 
remaining districts. Critics 
claim that this map deprives 
Democratic voters of their 
voting power. In the last sev-
en years since the passage of 
this map, Republicans have 
consistently held 13 of the 
18 congressional districts 
of Pennsylvania even when 
Democratic candidates won 
a majority of votes state-
wide.
As part of the testimony, 
petitioners called Carnegie 
Mellon professor Wesley 
Pegden to testify that the 
map had a partisan bias. 
Pegden has created an algo-
rithm that can test whether 
a districting map has been 
created with partisan intent. 
In order to test a map, the 
algorithm takes the map in 
question and makes random 
small changes to it. Then the 
algorithm checks whether 
these changes affected the 
map’s partisan bias. One 
can then determine using 
probabilities whether a map 
has been rigged along party 
lines. Pegden showed that 
when the Pennsylvania con-
gressional district map was 
plugged into the algorithm, 
making small changes 
almost always made the map 
more competitive. The court 
used Pegden’s algorithm as 
evidence that the map had 
been created to 
be purposefully 
uncompetitive.
Although the 
map has received 
signi?cant oppo-
sition, Republicans 
still stand by it. 
Steve Miskin, a 
spokesman for 
Republicans in 
the Pennsylvania 
State House of 
Representatives 
said in a Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette interview, “Some 
cynics might question the 
timing, after three elections 
of not saying a word about 
these maps.” In response to 
this doubt, David Gersch, 
a lawyer for the petition-
ers explained that the suit 
was not ?led until now so 
that there would be enough 
real evidence of the effects 
of the map on elections. 
Drew Crompton, the gen-
eral counsel to Republicans 
in the Pennsylvania State 
Senate, also defended the 
map, calling the suit “base-
less” in the Pittsburgh Post-
Gazette and pointing out 
that 36 Pennsylvania House 
Democrats had voted for the 
map.
On Jan. 23, the day 
after the Pennsylvania 
court’s decision, a group 
of Republicans from the 
Pennsylvania State House 
and Senate applied for the 
court to grant a stay on 
their order, meaning that 
the ruling wouldn’t go into 
effect until after the 2018 
congressional elections. The 
court denied this application 
two days later.
Historically, courts have 
hesitated to rule in political 
Data Privacy Day event showcases Carnegie Mellon research
ADAM TUNNARD
Junior Staffwriter
As technological 
growth in the 21st century 
continues its exponential 
climb, data and the in-
ternet weave themselves 
into the fabric of society 
in seemingly irreversible 
ways. Data privacy, or how 
data is distributed and col-
lected in relation to the 
public, has been a growing 
concern of most internet 
users due to unprecedent-
ed technological progress. 
Each year since 2014, this 
particular issue is brought 
to light here at Carnegie 
Mellon University in ob-
servance of International 
Data Privacy Day.
Dr. Lorrie Faith Cranor, 
an organizer of the event, 
said in an email to The 
Tartan that “privacy loss 
tends to sneak up on 
people,” and she hopes 
that the event helps 
“educate people about 
these issues and show 
them some tools they 
can use to protect 
themselves.”
This event, 
which also 
sought to 
publicize 
Carnegie 
Mellon’s 
innovative 
Privacy Engi-
neering Master’s 
program, was an 
open, public show-
case of the great 
research being 
done at Carnegie 
Mellon and how 
it can apply to our 
lives. Graduate and 
doctoral students 
presented their 
research in and 
around the Connan 
Room of the Cohon Cen-
ter, on topics from cyber-
security information shar-
ing, to health app privacy 
concerns.
There was much 
emphasis on general pri-
vacy in the “internet of 
things,” or the network 
of all manifestations of 
the internet: including 
smartphones, comput-
ers, software, sensors, 
and everything’s network 
connectivity. One of the 
presenters was Daniel 
Smullen, a PhD student 
in Software Engineer-
ing, who noted that “we 
don’t have implicit rights 
to privacy in the internet 
of things.” Because of this 
lack of implicit 
privacy, 
he and 
other 
researchers have spent the 
last few years developing 
a personal “privacy assis-
tant” website and app that 
alerts users of the various 
data collection techniques 
we are subjected to daily, 
from wifi routers, to facial 
recognition cameras, to 
location tracking.
Such presentations on 
research findings were 
prevalent, but in addition, 
booths were set up to edu-
cate the Carnegie Mellon 
community on how to 
protect their own privacy. 
One booth allowed people 
to type in a password they 
frequently use and test 
how strong it actually is. 
Another handed out flyers 
about how to avoid privacy 
intrusions on Facebook or 
Snapchat. One taught how 
to opt out of targeted ad-
vertising that operates by 
tracking your actions on 
the internet and selling 
your data.
Dr. Cranor believes 
that “most people care 
about their privacy and 
want to protect it, but a 
lot of people don’t know 
what they can actually do 
to protect their privacy.” 
The educational exercises 
in the Connan Room were 
aimed at allowing those 
who want to protect their 
data to gain the knowledge 
to do so.
The research and 
presentations suggested 
that the movement for 
data privacy, comprised 
of top academics and re-
searchers as well as ordi-
nary internet users, is only 
going to continue to grow 
in the wake of the general 
public’s realization that 
the internet isn’t as private 
as they might expect. 
The issue of privacy in 
the ‘internet of things’ is 
an issue that is relevant to 
almost all of the three bil-
lion people that currently 
have access to the internet. 
Events like International 
Data Privacy Day bring 
together academic institu-
tions, companies, gov-
ernments, and 
the general public to 
create a fruitful conversa-
tion on an impactful and 
topical issue.
At Carnegie Mellon, it 
was no different. That be-
ing said, if you were not 
able to attend, or happened 
to miss the many bubbling 
graduate students don-
ning “Privacy Matters” 
shirts in the Cohon Center, 
there is access to many of 
the resources presented at 
the event at the Carnegie 
Mellon University Privacy 
Day website, located at 
http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/
privacy-day/2018/. Many 
of the presentations and 
educational resources are 
archived and available.
As a school that exports 
so much innovation and 
educates many future cre-
ators of technology, Carn-
egie Mellon University 
also has a responsibility 
to also educate people 
on the ethical implica-
tions of certain privacy-
infringing technologies
With important 
events like Data Privacy 
Day happening on cam-
pus, new research 
being conducted 
and presented 
to understand 
the breadth 
of the issue, 
and more 
programs 
like the 
Master’s 
in Privacy 
Engineering 
that is being  
offered at the 
School of Com-
puter Science, it 
is hard not to feel 
more hopeful about 
the future of data 
privacy research and 
awareness.

Carnegie Mellon donates chairs to University of Puerto Rico
Gerrymandered map thrown out in PA Supreme Court case
cases, claiming that politics 
exists in the legislative do-
main. Baker v. Carr in 1962 
was the ?rst Supreme Court 
case to step into the “politi-
cal thicket” and rule against 
a redistricting practice. In 
general, courts have found 
racial gerrymandering to 
be unconstitutional but not 
partisan gerrymandering, 
largely because it has been 
dif?cult to measure par-
tisan af?liation because, 
unlike race, a voter could 
potentially change political 
parties from one election to 
another out of no fault of a 
district map. Consequently, 
in U.S. Supreme Court cases 
in 1986, 2004, and 2006, 
justices called partisan 
gerrymandering “illegiti-
mate, seriously harmful, in-
compatible with democratic 
principles and ‘manipulation 
of the electorate,’” but did 
not rule against the practice 
because it was dif?cult to 
draw the line between po-
litical and unconstitutional.
This Pennsylvania case 
is one of a number of cases 
of alleged Republican 
gerrymandering of state 
congressional district maps. 
The Republican strategy in 
2010 was to take control 
of state legislators so that 
the party could control the 
redistricting efforts across 
the country after the 2010 
census. With the 2018 con-
gressional elections loom-
ing, many of these maps are 
being taken to court. Most 
notable is Gill v. Whitford 
in Wisconsin, which has 
made it all the way to the 
U.S. Supreme court. One 
dissenting justice in the 
Pennsylvania case argued 
in his dissent that Pennsyl-
vania should hold off on 
changing its congressional 
map until after a ruling is 
decided in the national case. 
However the Supreme Court 
rules in Gill v. Whitford, and 
the Pennsylvania ruling 
means that the state will get 
a new district map. Experts 
say that if the court rules 
against gerrymandering in 
this national case, up to 20 
states will be required to 
join Pennsylvania in throw-
ing out their congressional 
maps too.

When Hurricane Maria 
hit Puerto Rico last Sept., 
much of the island’s infra-
structure was devastated. 
This month saw a renewed 
effort by groups at Carnegie 
Mellon to provide relief af-
ter the tragedy. In mid-Jan., 
nearly four months after the 
hurricane, there were pic-
tures posted to Twitter of 
families with children still 
living in tents. According to 
the website status.pr, which 
chronicles statistics on vari-
ous aspects of the island’s 
recovery, power generation 
is at 83 percent as of Friday, 
Jan. 26, while 69 percent 
of the island has electricity. 
CBS News correspondent 
David Begnaud pointed out 
in his near-daily status up-
date on Puerto Rico, via his 
Twitter, that about 450,000 
islanders remain without 
power.
The infrastructural dev-
astation included damage 
to the University of Puerto 
Rico at Mayaguez (UPRM), 
located in Mayaguez, a city 
on the western coast of the 
island. As part of the wave 
of efforts by the Carnegie 
Mellon community to lend 
a hand to Puerto Rico, the 
university shipped 342 arm-
table classroom chairs to 
UPRM, which are expected 
to arrive this month.
UPRM was chosen in part 
because Carnegie Mellon’s 
College of Engineering’s 
leadership had connec-
tions there. A group from 
the College of Engineering 
had visited UPRM in the 
summer of 2016 and met 
with colleagues there to 
discuss possible collabora-
tions, according to Dean 
James Garrett, Jr. of the 
College of Engineering, 
in an interview with The 
Tartan. “Shortly after Hur-
ricane Maria devastated 
Puerto Rico, I reached out 
to [Genock Portela, a profes-
sor and executive assistant 
at UPRM]. . .to ask him how 
we could be most helpful 
to them here at [Carnegie 
Mellon],” recalled Garrett.
Garrett was then given 
what he termed an “exten-
sive list” of equipment that 
UPRM needed to get it-
self back on its feet, which 
included desks and chairs 
to replace those damaged by 
the storm.
“I contacted my 
colleagues Ramayya 
Krishnan in the Heinz Col-
lege, Heinz Associate Dean 
Ann English, and Don Cof-
felt, Associate Vice President 
for Facilities Management 
and Campus Services and 
[Civil and Environmental 
Engineering] faculty mem-
ber, about this list to deter-
mine what we might be able 
to send them,” Garrett said, 
about the process in the in-
terview. “We recognized 
that they needed desks and 
tables since they were dam-
aged in the hurricane. We 
then realized that because 
we are renovating our class-
rooms, we have desks and 
tables we could donate to 
them.”
Coffelt then enlisted the 
help of the organization 
Brother’s Brother to help 
them transport the school 
furniture to UPRM.
“[Brother’s Brother 
Foundation’s] specialty is lo-
gistics — getting things from 
people who have it to people 
who need it, ef?ciently and 
at a low cost,” said Coffelt in 
a university press release.
On Jan. 10, the chairs 
were packed and shipped 
to New Jersey, where they 
were put on a ship to the is-
land, according to the press 
release. In an emailed state-
ment to The Tartan, UPRM’s 
Portela said that he was 
expecting the shipment of 
chairs within a few days.
The praise between 
Brother’s Brother and 
Carnegie Mellon goes both 
ways. Luke Hingson, the 
foundation’s president, told 
the university that “[i]t was 
easy for [the foundation] 
to say yes to this project be-
cause of the quality of the 
partners involved on the 
giving side and the receiving 
side.”
This is not the only 
time Brother’s Brother 
has assisted in a Carnegie 
Mellon effort to help Puerto 
Rico. The foundation was 
also involved in helping 
Rosana Guernica, a junior 
at Carnegie Mellon who 
crowdfunded charter planes 
to deliver supplies to Puerto 
Rico and evacuate islanders 
who were in need of medi-
cal treatments not available 
post-hurricane, as well as 
their families. The Tartan 
reported on this effort last 
semester.
In a press release, Gar-
rett was heartened by the 
teamwork involved the chair 
donation effort. “It was truly 
a collaborative effort that 
epitomizes what we do here 
at [Carnegie Mellon].”

#MeToo movement deserves greater coverage
SHLOK GOYAL
Junior Staffwriter
Much like how voters rarely 
glance below the top tickets on 
the ballot, students often don’t 
take time to glance below the tu-
ition, housing, and meal costs on 
their Carnegie Mellon bill. If they 
did, they would notice the larg-
est fee that they have to pay to 
attend Carnegie Mellon—the ac-
tivities fee, at a cool $129/semes-
ter for undergraduates and $107 
for graduates this academic year.
As its name suggests, this is 
the fee that funds most of the stu-
dent organizations on campus. 
However, for such a signi?cant 
fee, it is determined based on an 
outdated model, which itself is 
largely arbitrary.
Since at least the 2014-15 aca-
demic year, when the undergrad-
uate activities fee was $123 and 
the graduate fee $101, the fee has 
changed by $2 for both groups 
every single year. There is no sci-
ence behind this, no rationale, 
only a self-perpetuating cycle of 
constant $2 increases.
Next year’s fee of $131 for 
undergraduates and $108 for 
graduates seems like it has some 
science behind it, indexed as it 
is to the Consumer Price Index, 
a measure of in?ation meant to 
measure changes in standard of 
living. However, students’ travel 
and pizza costs—the primary 
uses for the activities fee funds—
are barely measured by this in-
dex. As a result, while this in?a-
tion measure might work well for 
economists, it is useless for our 
purposes.
The lack of thought that has 
historically gone into determin-
ing the fee each year is not only 
remarkable—over $2 million are 
on the line annually—it is also 
detrimental for students’ experi-
ences at Carnegie Mellon.
This is because the univer-
sity is consistently failing to meet 
students’ ?nancial demands for 
their extracurricular activities. 
Between the 2009-10 and 2014-
15 years, the amount of funds 
requested from the Joint Fund-
ing Committee (JFC), the group 
of students charged with allo-
cating the activities fee to each 
student organization on cam-
pus, increased 36.26 percent. 
Over these same ?ve years, the 
amount the JFC recommended 
increased by a roughly commen-
surate 36.06 percent.
However, between 2014-
15 and 2017-18, the requested 
amount increased by a further 
35.97 percent, but the recom-
mended amount only increased 
17.86 percent. While students 
are requesting 7.98 percent more 
money each year, the JFC is only 
recommending 4.19 percent 
more. This has caused the gap be-
tween the requested and recom-
mended amounts to go from less 
than $600,000 in 2014-15 to over 
$1 million this year.
Clearly then, demand for the 
students’ activities funds has 
been rising, but supply has not. 
The increase in demand is likely 
due to the greater number of stu-
dent organizations on campus 
(255 organizations applied for 
JFC funding for this academic 
year as opposed to the 221 ap-
plying for 2014-15) and that 
each organization is attending 
or hosting more events and thus 
spending more money.
The solution to this under-
funding problem starts with 
amending the way the student 
activities fee is determined. In-
stead of deciding upon an arbi-
trary increase, the Student Body 
Vice President of Finance (SB-
VPF) should study the changes in 
the costs Carnegie Mellon orga-
nizations incur.
One way to do this would 
be by looking at line items an 
organization has had for the 
past three years and tracking 
the change in costs for those line 
items. Taking a random sample 
of such line items across all orga-
nizations would create a measure 
which the activities fee increase 
could be indexed to. This would 
thus more accurately re?ect in-
creases in student organizations’ 
costs than a frivolous $2 increase.
A cruder but easier-to-imple-
ment method would ?rst take 
the average annual percentage 
increase in the requested amount 
of funds between the last four 
years, weighted to emphasize in-
creases in the most recent years. 
Then, the resulting percentage 
is the proportional increase we 
want to see in the JFC’s recom-
mended amount that year. It is 
straightforward to back-calculate 
the activities fee from that ?gure.
These empirical approaches 
would likely lead to higher ac-
tivities fee if implemented with-
out other changes, at least in the 
short term while Carnegie Mel-
lon continues adding more orga-
nizations and existing organiza-
tions discover new outlets that 
require funding.
Since these causes are likely 
temporary, they can be resolved 
by tapping into JFC’s reserves. 
The reserves exist precisely for 
this kind of ephemeral rise in de-
mand and should be used to en-
sure that student organizations 
get the money they need at low 
cost to the overall student body. 
Furthermore, organizations usu-
ally tend to spend less than their 
entire budget each year, which 
means that even after drawing 
from the reserves, we will not 
deplete it signi?cantly for future 
years.
Second, the university needs 
to better support student orga-
nizations looking for outside 
sponsorships. While the univer-
sity has great relationships with 
corporations, institutions, and 
alumni that it leverages when it 
comes to funding new buildings 
or research, the university should 
better extend those relationships 
to help students secure funding 
for their organizations.
Many students either don’t 
know that such sponsorships are 
feasible options or lack the con-
tacts to make them happen. The 
university can improve this state 
of affairs by better communicat-
ing how organizations can ac-
quire outside funding, provide 
more extensive training on how 
to do so at events like the Tartan 
Leader Conference, and be will-
ing to use their relevant contacts 
for organizations’ bene?t rather 
than just for the administration’s 
initiatives.
If more organizations can se-
cure outside funding, it will re-
duce the pressure on student ac-
tivities fees to cover all the costs 
while teaching students practical 
skills on marketing an idea and

Arguably the 
worst thing that 
could happen 
to the #MeToo 
movement would 
be to sti?e the 
coverage that 
has prompted 
so much 
reevaluation on a 
societal scale.

The national and public con-
versation about sexual harass-
ment started for many with a New 
York Times noti?cation on their 
phone that linked to a story, writ-
ten by Megan Twohey and Jodi 
Kantor, that detailed instances 
of abuse and sexual misconduct 
at the hand of powerful producer 
Harvey Weinstein. Much of the 
public conversation has been 
built on the backs of powerful 
reporting done by hardworking 
journalists and the testimony of 
brave men and women that fuel 
these stories. 
But journalistic institutions 
have not always pursued such 
reporting as avidly as they per-
haps ought to, sometimes in the 
interest of not wanting to make 
powerful enemies, or shying 
away from stories they deem as 
too controversial. Notably, NBC 
passed on Trump’s “pussy” tape, 
which eventually was published 
by Access Hollywood. Months 
later, they passed again on the 
Weinstein story though it was 
brought to them by their own 
contributor, Ronan Farrow, and, 
according to Farrow in an inter-
view with MSNBC, there had 
been “multiple determinations 
that it was reportable.”
Additionally, focus in coverage 
has leaned toward celebrities 
accused of sexual harassment. 
Many of the actors wearing black 
and Time’s Up pins at the Golden 
Globes had either worked with 
people being accused of sexual 
harassment or had faced sexual 
harassment allegations them-
selves. An abstract commitment 
by public ?gures to end a culture 
that they themselves are perpe-
trating does little to affect the ac-
tual systemic issues at play. The 
Time’s Up organization itself, 
and many of the actors involved, 
were careful to make it clear that 
the problem did not begin and 
end with Hollywood, with ac-
tivists such as Monica Ramirez, 
who works to defend the rights of 
migrant workers, Tarana Burke, 
activist for women of color and 
founder of the #MeToo move-
ment, and Marai Larasi, who 
works to combat gender-based vi-
olence, brought as dates by actors 
af?liated with the organization. 
Though much of the public 
attention has centered around 
stories that involve the rich and 
famous, some of the most power-
ful reporting that this movement 
has spawned has focused on the 
pervasive problem of harassment 
and sexual assault that touches 
workers on the factory floor at 
Ford or in the hospitality indus-
try or in public housing. Though 
these stories may have received 
less attention, they highlight the 
potential of good journalism to 
expose issues that may be harder 
to cover because they are system-
ic, or affect people with less of a 
societal voice. 
Sometimes, there is question 
about whether stories should 
be covered at all, markedly, the 
babe.net story about a question-
able sexual encounter involving 
actor and comedian Aziz Ansari. 
One of the most outspoken crit-
ics was The New York Times staff 
editor Bari Weiss, who, in an 
opinion piece, called the article 
“arguably the worst thing that 
has happened to the #MeToo 
movement.”
Arguably the worst thing that 
could happen to the #MeToo 
movement would be to stifle the 
coverage that has prompted so 
much reevaluation on a societal 
scale. It is possible to argue that 
reactions may not always be pro-
portional, or that the movement, 
like most that happen on such a 
large scale, may lack some nu-
ance, but recent examples have 
seemed not to have borne this 
theory out. Consequences have 
differed depending on what is al-
leged, and have ranged from mild 
public shaming to legal moves. 
Moreover, refusing the public the 
chance to even be allowed to dis-
sect and classify these instances 
does them a disservice. The role 
of journalism in this movement is 
to place well reported newswor-
thy stories in the public forum 
while keeping a commitment to 
high-quality reporting. 
At the sentencing this past 
week of Larry Nassar, doctor 
and pedophile, Assistant Attor-
ney General Angela Povialitis 
claimed that without a 2016 sto-
ry in the Indianapolis Star, and 
the courage that it took for sur-
vivor Rachael Denhollander to 
contact them, Nassar would still 
be working as a doctor. Povialitis 
stated, “what finally started 
this reckoning and ended this 
decades-long cycle of abuse was 
investigative reporting.” Such is 
the power of diligent reporting 
at this moment.

The Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court’s recent 4-3 ruling which 
struck down the egregiously ger-
rymandered congressional map 
serves as an important example 
and precedent for an issue that is 
already being argued in the U.S. 
Supreme Court. The map in ques-
tion skewed so far to favor Repub-
licans that it was ruled unconstitu-
tional in the recent Pennsylvania 
decision. With multiple gerry-
mandering cases now reaching 
the U.S. Supreme Court, this case 
stands as an important example of 
potential for major change. That 
change might just be a national 
ruling that could be used to dis-
mantle numerous gerrymandered 
congressional maps across the 
country, most of which favor Re-
publicans.
In a last ditch effort, top Penn-
sylvania Republicans are now call-
ing for the U.S. Supreme Court to 
hear their case. It is worth noting 
that the Court has already heard 
arguments in one case related to 
gerrymandering this term, and 
are waiting to hear arguments 
on another. With this in mind, 
hearing the Pennsylvania case 
might be redundant, but there 
is an important detail to bear in 
mind: while the Court heard their 
?rst gerrymandering case of this 
term months ago, they have yet 
to hold a vote to reach a decision. 
If the Court is hesitant to reach a 
national gerrymandering deci-
sion—as its impact could be wide-
spread and alter the outcomes of 
numerous future elections—they 
might hesitate to give a ruling in 
the next case they hear. If so, the 
Pennsylvania case could prove 
to be very important. Especially 
given the strong ruling issued by 
the state Supreme Court, the na-
tional court would have to either 
accept this strong partisan gerry-
mandering ruling or completely 
strike it down. Striking the state 
ruling down would be a more 
daunting task that the federal jus-
tices would no doubt hesitate to 
undertake. As it currently stands, 
the national decision will likely 
come down to Justice Kennedy, as 
the other justices will likely split 
4-4 along partisan lines, a rather 
disturbing fact for our democracy.
Gerrymandering is an effort 
almost exclusively undertaken by 
Republicans for Republicans as 
they desperately hold on to an elec-
torate that is growing younger and 
more and more displeased with 
modern conservative governance. 
It is impossible to ignore the con-
text given here by our political cli-
mate. With many political analysts 
saying that a blue wave of Demo-
cratic congressional victories is 
coming, Republicans are undoubt-
edly terri?ed. They have passed 
an extremely unpopular piece of 
legislation in the recent tax bill, 
whose short term bene?ts for 
working and middle class families 
will disappear in a decade whilst 
permanently bene?ting corpora-
tions and the wealthy. The pace 
at which they have been trying 
to ram through this legislation is 
suggestive of the sense of urgency 
Republicans feel. They know their 
agenda is unpopular and dated, 
and could easily be torn apart by 
this November.
So, with a crucial election on 
the horizon, it is unsurprising that 
the party of guns and our racist 
president will seek any electoral 
advantage it can obtain. They 
will seek it by any means neces-
sary. A strong national partisan 
gerrymandering ruling would 
permanently alter the electoral 
reality of the United States. The 
effect it would have would be 
good for democracy and bad for 
Republicans. This ?ts a pattern 
of modern American politics: De-
mocracy and the GOP often stand 
at odds. Whether it be shock-
ing attempts to shield President 
Trump from the Mueller probe, or 
disgraceful inaction in response 
to mass killings by white gun-
men, the Republicans know no 
shame. So, why not soil the U.S. 
Supreme Court too? The only way 
Republicans hold onto power is if 
they keep winning elections, and 
it will be much easier for them to 
do that if blatantly partisan con-
gressional maps are allowed to 
continue to exist and to continue 
to be gerrymandered in favor of 
Republicans. America is chang-
ing. What it means to be an Amer-
ican is changing. It always has 
been, and it will continue to do so. 
Perhaps, then, it is not surprising 
the party of “Make America Great 
Again” seeks to perpetuate un-
democratic elections to continue 
de?ling democracy.

Pennsylvania gerrymandering degrades democractic ideals
Lectures with concrete examples improve students’ learning
ZACHARY GOLDSTEIN
Imagine you are sitting in 
Spanish class, and the teach-
er plays “Despacito” over the 
speakers. The students chatter 
amongst themselves. They say, 
“Wow, that’s a great song!” and 
“I wonder what it all means!”
Following the musical intro-
duction, the teacher launches 
into a lesson built around the 
vocabulary, grammar, and cul-
tural references in the hit song. 
Throughout the class, students 
are engaged and eager to learn, 
because they understand why 
the subject material is important 
and relevant to the real world. 
In particular, they are motivated 
by the desire to better appreciate 
Luis Fonsi’s hit single featuring 
Daddy Yankee the next time they 
listen to it.
Alternatively, imagine you 
are sitting in a different Spanish 
class, where the instructor starts 
by handing out a long list of vo-
cabulary and grammatical con-
cepts. The lesson begins by go-
ing through the vocabulary and 
explaining the grammar, delving 
into the etymological roots of 
words and various irregular verb 
conjugations.
Students are half asleep, un-
sure why any of this is impor-
tant or worth paying attention 
to, longing for the end of the 
class period. Later in the lesson, 
the instructor might even play 
“Despacito,” and while the stu-
dents are pleasantly surprised 
to hear the song, the class time 
was largely wasted because 
the students were not engaged 
enough throughout the lesson 
to understand the song lyrics at 
the end.
Most would likely agree that 
the first Spanish class, with 
concrete examples presented 
from the start and abstract ideas 
explained later, is the better 
way to go. Yet again and again, 
explanations start with abstract 
ideas and only at the end prog-
ress to the interesting applica-
tions of those ideas.
This mistake is made so many 
times, because, in the mind of 
the explainer, starting from ab-
stract ideas is the most intuitive 
approach. In the head of a flu-
ent Spanish speaker, the most 
fundamental core concepts are 
vocabulary and grammar, while 
on the outskirts of the web of 
knowledge are example applica-
tions of the core concepts like 
songs and stories. So, unfortu-
nately, this is how topics are of-
ten taught.
But, consciously making 
an effort to change this could 
greatly improve student engage-
ment and learning. Starting 
with interesting, real-world ap-
plications of a topic signals to 
students that the broader, more 
boring, abstract explanations 
are worth suffering through and 
staying engaged with because of 
the great opportunities of apply-
ing what you learn. Yes, students 
might not grasp all the inner 
workings of the application at 
first, but that is okay so long as 
they are motivated to continue 
learning.
Notice that this opinion piece 
began by launching straight 
into a concrete example, and 
only after appreciating the story 
does the reader get the abstract 
explanation about pedagogy. 
Maybe readers would never even 
reach this point in the article if 
the reverse were true and the 
article began with a discussion 
of abstract-first versus concrete-
first explanations, saving the 
example of listening to “Despaci-
to” in Spanish class for the end.
So next time you are 
teaching, TA-ing, or even just 
explaining something to your 
friend, remember to start with 
the interesting, concrete exam-
ple and only after that delve into 
the fundamental ideas underly-
ing it.
Inspiration for this opinion 
piece comes from the education 
podcast Ben, Ben, and Blue.

Trump’s presidency: year in review Allocation of activities fee must be changed
get sponsors. Thus, we can 
progress toward achieving two 
of the university’s goals: a bet-
ter experience for students and 
one that is at the same time 
?nancially accessible to all.
While the administration ex-
ecutes this plan, students need 
to rely on one another to identify 
ways to cut costs. After review-
ing hundreds of organizations’ 
applications, the JFC will surely 
find, as I have, that some organi-
zations spend far less on the very 
same events or similar line items 
that other organizations end up 
spending more on.
The JFC and mid-year fund-
ing sources, then, should iden-
tify organizations that spend an 
unusually low amount per per-
son on certain costs, ask them 
how they managed to cut costs 
and spread that knowledge to 
other organizations so they, 
too, can take advantage of the 
cost-saving methods employed 
by the first organization. This 
will allow student organizations 
to do everything they want to, 
just at a lower cost, again saving 
money that can be used for other 
activities.
Lastly, the ratio between the 
activities fee charged to under-
graduates and graduates is also 
whimsical. The lower fees the 
graduate students pay is com-
pounded by the fact that 70 
percent of their fees go directly 
to the Graduate Student Assem-
bly while only 10 percent of the 
undergraduates’ fees go to the 
Undergraduate Student Senate. 
The remainder of both go to the 
JFC.
Such a distribution makes 
sense if 76.4 percent of the funds 
that JFC allocates goes to under-
graduates and the remainder to 
graduate students. If the propor-
tion is more, then graduate stu-
dents are relatively over-paying 
while if it is less, undergraduates 
are funding graduates’ activities.
To resolve this potential dis-
crepancy, the SBVPF could track 
the ratio of undergraduates to 
graduates in each organization, 
then use that to estimate how 
much money was given to un-
dergraduate students and how 
much to graduate students. 
She can then prepare a proposal 
for the activities fee that splits 
the costs between the two fairly. 
Note that this will not affect how 
much funding any organization 
receives—only the split between 
how much undergraduate and 
graduate students pay as part of 
the activities fee.
Logistically, this can be done 
by asking each organization 
how many of its members are 
undergraduates and how many 
are graduates and basing the 
estimates off those numbers. 
However, it might be difficult 
to parse out the benefit an or-
ganization provides from the 
composition of its members. For 
example, even if AB Films mostly 
has undergraduates, graduate 
students certainly benefit from 
the movies it plays.
An alternative method would 
then be for the Undergradu-
ate Student Senate, Graduate 
Student Assembly, and SBVPF 
to devise a ratio that they think 
accurately represents the break-
down in spending between un-
dergraduates and graduates. 
This ratio can then be used to 
identify what the ratio between 
the two’s activities fees should 
be. The Student Government by-
laws imply that this ratio should 
be based on 70 percent of the 
activities fee being spent on un-
dergraduates and 30 percent on 
graduates. But, this figure can 
be easily amended if the student 
government finds it necessary, 
such as to the current rate of 
76.4 percent.
The student activities fee and 
university support for external 
funding have not kept pace with 
the rising demand to use those 
funds from student organiza-
tions. If we are serious about im-
proving everyone’s experience 
at Carnegie Mellon at an afford-
able price, we must reform how 
we determine the activities fee, 
use the JFC reserve for the next 
few years, encourage and help 
student leaders gain outside 
scholarships and grants for their 
organizations, and implement a 
system whereby organizations 
can share with each other how 
to cut their costs.
These changes will make dis-
bursement of the activities fee 
fairer and more effective for ev-
eryone. Students’ involvement 
in extracurriculars has always 
been a source of pride for Carn-
egie Mellon. It’s time we worked 
to financially support the un-
precedented demand for extra-
curricular involvement we are 
now seeing.
ACTIVITIES FEE from A4
MADELINE KIM
Just over a year ago, Donald 
Trump of?cially became the 45th 
President of the United States. 
Since then, America has witnessed 
a president unlike any other. A real-
ity star who “spoke his mind,” who 
seemed to be unafraid of hitting the 
“tweet” button, would soon “have 
a nuclear button” that he proudly 
admitted “works.” A man without 
any prior political experience had 
de?ed all odds, going against polls 
and predictions. Regardless of the 
results from the general election, 
the free world saw a new chapter in 
its history thanks to its new leader.
Trump made his objectives of 
his presidency clear since the cam-
paign, best summarized by his 
iconic slogan “Make America Great 
Again:” putting “America ?rst.” 
To help ful?ll the goals of his ?rst 
term, Trump released his “Contract 
with the American Voter” in which 
he set up tasks for his ?rst 100 days 
in of?ce. He may not have been 
able to check off every box on his 
list, but he made signi?cant strides 
towards establishing “law and or-
der,” protecting American workers, 
and “draining the swamp” in Wash-
ington. As of today, he has signed 
nearly sixty executive orders, more 
than any preceding president had 
this far in his respective presidency.
There have been immediate and 
positive results from the Trump 
administration. The stock market 
continues to go up, and a sample 
of economists selected by The Wall 
Street Journal almost unanimous-
ly reported that job creation 
and gross domestic product 
growth may be due to Trump’s 
small-government approach. 
However, these results cannot 
override the tumultuousness 
of the administration.
Trump may have been 
praised by some economists for 
his tax cut plan, but he is still far 
from being traditionally 
conservative. Trade, 
often supported by 
small-government 
ideals, is now a 
topic targeted 
by conserva-
tive criticism. 
Trump broke the 
old tradition of 
conservatism by 
pulling out of the 
Trans-Paci?c Partner-
ship (TPP) altogether, 
just as he promised during his 
campaign. He is continuing this 
trend by seeking negotiations for 
the North American Free Trade 
Agreement (NAFTA), if not a termi-
nation of the United States’ involve-
ment altogether. Prime Minister 
Justin Trudeau has demonstrated 
con?dence in the deal, aiming to 
exemplify NAFTA’s bene?ts to the 
Canadian economy to “show [to] 
our neighbor to the south.” Trump’s 
Agriculture Secretary, Sonny Per-
due, shows con?dence that Trump 
will not completely pull out of 
NAFTA due to the fact that ending a 
trade agreement with Canada, the 
U.S.’s largest trade partner, would 
have signi?cant consequences and 
wipe out jobs. However, it is un-
certain that he will not ultimately 
decide to end trade deals in an at-
tempt to create more domestic jobs.
The TPP and NAFTA are not the 
only trade agreements that Trump 
has been wrestling with. To attack 
the U.S. trade de?cit, Trump turned 
to Korea and threatened to end the 
United States-Korea Free Trade 
Agreement (KORUS FTA) despite 
the fact that Korea, as of 2017, con-
tributes $21 billion out of the $724 
billion total trade de?cit, which 
amounts to not even three percent 
of the total trade de?cit, thus taking 
away jobs created by Korean plants 
in the U.S. For instance, Hyundai’s 
contribution in Alabama and Kia’s 
in Georgia would both be negative-
ly impacted by the withdrawal of 
the KORUS FTA but may not be able 
to generate the domestic jobs that 
Trump has promised to compensate 
for the damage. However, as Presi-
dent Moon Jae-In and Trump are in 
talks of renegotiating the KORUS 
FTA, we may successfully avert a 
possible economic damage.
Perhaps his most memorable 
campaign promise was building 
the wall and “have Mexico pay for 
it.” However, construction remains 
stalled to this day. Although he 
seems to be hard-set on the wall, 
which has 
been sug-
gested to 
be both economically demanding 
and possibly ineffective, Trump is 
willing to compromise by offering 
citizenship for dreamers so that his 
wall can be built. This has received 
criticism from some on the left; 
Senator Kamala Harris noted that 
Trump was quick to end Deferred 
Action for Childhood Arrivals 
(DACA) but also quick to provide 
citizenship for dreamers in ex-
change for a border wall. However, 
prominent voices of the right, such 
as former congressman Joe Walsh, 
also showed disappointment in 
Trump’s plan for compromise. Like 
a signi?cant portion of other sup-
porters of the wall, Walsh wanted 
the wall to be built at the expense 
of Mexico, not at the expense of 
providing “a pathway for provid-
ing citizenship” for undocumented 
immigrants. This compromise, he 
argues, is “not what [Trump] said 
during the campaign.”
Politics has never been a topic 
in which clean and clear solutions 
are made; the saying “never discuss 
politics or religion in polite com-
pany” has existed for as long as it 
has for a reason. However, given 
Trump’s disapproval rating is below 
40 percent — low for a president in 
of?ce for a relatively short amount 
of time — it is clear that the trend 
of a more distinct clash between 
political ideologies burgeoning is

A dusty, blackened 
thigh bone that may rep-
resent a “missing link” 
in human evolution was 
rejected from a major an-
thropologist conference 
this month, prompting 
frustration among the 
anthropology community 
and adding to the confu-
sion surrounding a now-
infamous specimen.
Scientists still don’t 
know exactly when hu-
mans diverged from other 
apes on the evolutionary 
tree. Most anthropologists 
agree that the most recent 
species from which both 
hominins and other apes 
descended — the “chim-
panzee-human last com-
mon ancestor” (CHLCA) 
— lived between four and 
ten million years ago.
Sahelanthropus tchaden-
sis, an early hominin spe-
cies that lived around 
seven million years ago, is 
a strong candidate for the 
CHLCA, because it has a 
mix of chimp-like and hu-
man traits. Like chimpan-
zees, Sahelanthropus had 
a small brain, a strongly 
ridged brow, and an elon-
gated skull, according 
to the Smithsonian. Like 
humans, Sahelanthropus 
had small teeth and a 
short facial structure.
Most significantly, 
Sahelanthropus’ skull 
would have connected 
to its spinal cord at the 
bottom, not the back. 
Sahelanthropus shares 
this trait with a more 
recent human relative, 
Orrorin tugenensis, and 
may be Orrorin’s ancestor. 
In Orrorin, the skull open-
ing at the bottom allowed 
it to stand up straight and 
walk on two legs; Orrorin 
was confirmed bipedal in 
2002 by scientists who ex-
amined Orrorin leg bones. 
Was Sahelanthropus also 
bipedal? Or did it just 
have the skull structure 
that made bipedalism 
possible, later on down 
the line?
Knowing whether 
Sahelanthropus walked 
upright would help sci-
entists fit the species and 
its probable descendants 
into the phylogenetic 
tree of human evolution. 
If Sahelanthropus is the 
CHLCA, it’s a direct an-
cestor of modern humans, 
which means Orrorin may 
be also. It’s unclear right 
now how Orrorin is re-
lated to us, but a few sci-
entists believe that mod-
ern humans descended 
from a species of Orrorin 
— as opposed to a spe-
cies of Australopithecus, 
which has been the domi-
nant view for a century. 
If Sahelanthropus and 
Orrorin are our ancestors, 
and not Australopithecus, 
much of modern anthro-
pology will be overturned.

Computing on Net-
work Infrastructure for 
Pervasive Perception, 
Cognition, and Action 
(CONIX) is a $27.5 mil-
lion initiative by the 
Semiconductor Research 
Corporation (SRC) that 
aims to increase the levels 
of autonomy and intelli-
gence into the internet of 
things (IoT) networks.
This initiative is 
comprised of research-
ers from six partner uni-
versities — University of 
California, Berkeley, Uni-
versity of Washington, 
University of Southern 
California, University of 
California, San Diego, 
University of California, 
Los Angeles — led by and 
headquartered at Carn-
egie Mellon University. 
CONIX is co-directed by 
Anthony Rowe — an As-
sociate Professor in the 
Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department 
at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and Prabal Dutta 
— an Associate Profes-
sor at the Electrical En-
gineering and Computer 
Sciences Department of 
University of California, 
Berkeley. The initiative 
had its kick-off meeting 
on Jan. 26, 2018.
From Wi-Fi controlled 
string lights for dorm 
rooms to app controlled 
car locks to health-mon-
itoring clothes, inter-
device communication 
along with human-device 
communication has be-
come a virtue of what 
it means to be a hu-
man in the modern age. 
This space of devices 
collecting and interacting 
with each other forms 
the space that we call 
the IoT. As such devices 
— sensing, collecting 
data, and interacting 
with humans —  be-
come more pervasive 
and more integrated 
into our lives, it be-
comes increasingly im-
portant to be able to 
build networks that are 
better equipped to han-
dle these interactions 
between the cloud and 
the edge devices. In a 
Carnegie Mellon press 
release, Dean James 
H. Garrett Jr. of the 
College of Engineering 
stated, “The extent to 
which IoT will disrupt 
our future will depend 
on how well we build 
scalable and secure 
networks that connect 
us to a very large num-
ber of systems that can 
orchestrate our lives 
and communities. 
CONIX will develop 
novel architectures for 
large-scale, distributed 
computing systems 
that have immense im-
plications for social in-
teraction, smart build-
ings and infrastructure, 
and highly con-
nected communi-
ties, commerce and 
defense.”
CONIX has divided 
its research agenda 
into four broad themes 
— Physically-Coupled 
Cognitive Percep-
tual Systems; Plat-
forms, Programming 
and Synthesis; Secu-
rity, Robustness and 
Privacy; and Interact-
ing Services.

Junior Staffwriter
Last week, the Public 
Library of Science (PLOS 
ONE) journal published 
a controversial study 
in which University of 
Alberta virologist David 
Evans and his associate 
Ryan Noyce synthesized 
a horsepox virus from 
bits of mail-ordered ge-
netic material. Noyce 
and Evans obtained the 
horsepox DNA, syn-
thesized the genes in a 
modern vaccinia virus 
(VACV) to create the 
horsepox virus (HPXV). 
Then, they showed 
that the virus was able 
to infect cells and repro-
duce. They describe all 
their processes in thor-
ough detail in their pa-
per, which was published 
on Jan. 19, 2018.
This study was funded 
by Tonix, a pharmaceu-
tical company based in 
New York whose presi-
dent and chief executive 
officer Seth Lederman 
is listed as one of the 
authors on the study.
Horsepox is non-lethal 
to humans, but it is a rel-
ative of smallpox, which 
was declared to be offi-
cially eradicated in 1980 
by the World Health 
Organization (WHO). 
The WHO also bans 
the synthesis of the full 
genome of smallpox. The 
last strains of variola are 
kept under high security 
in Russia and the United 
States. In 2017, Science 
magazine reported that 
motivation for the re-
search, according to its 
sponsor Seth Lederman, 
president of the pharma-
ceutical company Tonix, 
was to develop a safer, 
reliable smallpox vaccine 
with fewer side effects. 
But critics say that not 
only do safer vaccines 
already exist, but also 
that the paper’s publica-
tion in an open-source 
journal could potentially 
further the threat of a 
smallpox outbreak via 
a bioterrorist attack. 
Gregory Koblentz, a bio-
defense expert at George 
Mason University in Ar-
lington, Virginia explains 
that while getting hands 
on the smallpox virus is 
not an immediate threat, 
over time as more and 
more people gain access 
to this technology, it 
could become a threat.
The study by Leder-
man, Evans, and Noyce 
has been criticized for 
claiming that it could 
further the development 
of a “safe” smallpox vac-
cine, without mention-
ing that such vaccines 
have already been devel-
oped and that the market 
for a smallpox vaccine 
using horsepox is seem-
ingly nonexistent.
 In response, Leder-
man claims that he is not 
convinced by the clinical 
trials, or the historical 
success of other smallpox 
vaccines like the MVA or 
the LC16m8 from Japan.
A weakened form 
of this vaccinia virus, 
known as modified vac-
cinia Ankara (MVA) was 
developed in the 1970s 
by the German-Danish 
company Bavarian Nor-
dic, and was adminis-
tered to about 150,000 
German children at the 
time. It doesn’t repli-
cate in humans and has 
been proven to be safe on 
HIV-positive and stem-
cell transplant patients. 
However, Lederman ar-
gues that because MVA 
was developed and dis-
tributed as smallpox was 
becoming more and more 
rare, its effectiveness in a 
real smallpox outbreak 
remains untested and 
could be a huge gamble.
Before you panic, you 
should know that ac-
cording to the Center 
for Disease Control and 
Prevention (CDC), there 
is a large enough supply 
of the smallpox vaccine 
for the American public 
in case of such an attack. 
Since 9/11, the U.S. gov-
ernment has stockpiled 
on millions of doses of 
vaccinia, the mild poxvi-
rus used in the smallpox 
vaccine. 
Today, the U.S. gov-
ernment plans to acquire 
13 million more doses of 
MVA, and already has 
28 million, according to 
Science magazine. This 
vaccine is less risky than 
the vaccinia vaccines 
which were frequently 
used pre-eradication.
As of now, Tonix is 
developing vaccines us-
ing horsepox that have 
been tested on microbes 
which would have been 
infected had they not 
been vaccinated. 
The company is cur-
rently working on a 
more controlled version 
of the vaccine that they 
could test on humans.
The debate around 
this issue is related to 
others about whether 
the remaining strains 
of the smallpox virus, 
secured in government 
labs in the United States 
and Russia, should be 
destroyed. In 2014, the 
World Health Organiza-
tion had recommended 
that these labs get rid 
of the virus—but as 
CDC scientist Inger Da-
mon stated in Smith-
sonian that same year, 
if another outbreak 
occurred, keeping the 
strains would be neces-
sary in order to research 
safer vaccines and treat-
ments. 
To that end, 
Lederman, Evans, and 
Noyce have proven that 
the reintroduction of 
smallpox is no longer a 
theoretical possibility 
while simultaneously 
aiding preparedness 
for such a situation by 
bringing the topic back 
into discussion. 
However, by 
publishing their paper, 
many believe that they 
have also increased the 
risk of that happening.
Recreation of horsepox vaccine sparks public outcry
Scientists discover “defense islands” used by bacteria
CRISPR/Cas9 — widely 
known for its applications 
in gene-editing — is also 
a part of the prokaryotic 
immune system. 
This means that it helps 
certain forms of bacteria 
protect themselves from 
viruses called phages that 
take over the genetic ma-
chinery of the cell and 
force them to replicate 
viral DNA. 
However, this mecha-
nism isn’t the only one 
protecting bacteria from 
foreign substances.
A study published re-
cently in Science magazine 
explains that bacteria have 
more defense systems than 
previously thought. These 
systems were found in dif-
ferent “defense islands” — 
genes that tend to cluster 
together in the genome.
According to Science 
News, the researchers 
found nine groups of anti-
phage defenses and one 
anti-plasmid defense. 
This research was con-
ducted by researchers of 
the Department of Mo-
lecular Genetics at Weiz-
mann Institute of Science 
in Israel.

Chinese scientists clone longtailed macaque babies
For the first time since 
Dolly the Sheep was cre-
ated in 1996, scientists 
report the successful 
cloning of long-tailed ma-
caques using the method 
used to produce Dolly.
The two female baby 
macaques — six and eight 
weeks old — are named 
Zhong Zhong and Hua 
Hua, drawn from the word 
zhonghua. The animals 
are reportedly healthy 
and are currently living 
in an incubator. One of 
the authors of this study, 
Qiang Sun, a researcher 
at the Institute of Neuro-
science in Shanghai, said, 
“The two monkeys are 
very active and healthy, 
they progress very rapidly 
like human babies… Ev-
ery other day, they seem 
more active and their mo-
tor system is much more 
developed and [there are] 
no signs of abnormality.”
With the release of this 
news, the scientists of the 
study assure the public 
that experimenting is not 
a stepping stone to human 
cloning and is too risky to 
not pose ethical concerns.

Plastic in oceans threatens coral reefs worldwide
Climate change and 
bleaching have already in-
corrigibly affected the coral 
reef population. Now, re-
searchers at Cornell Univer-
sity have discovered that the 
presence of plastic makes 
corals more susceptible to 
disease and intensifies this 
affect. 
Scientists say that these 
plastics — part of the 
oceans’ trash such as bottle 
caps, plastic bags, etc. — act 
as carriers of pathogenic 
bacteria that lead to coral 
reef death due to a disease 
called white syndrome. The 
presence of plastic increases 
the corals disease suscepti-
bility rates from four to 89 
percent. 
Cornell University re-
searcher Drew Harvell ex-
plains, “They basically tear 
open the skin of the coral 
and that can allow an in-
fection from anywhere to 
start.”
As scientists predict that 
the plastic going into the 
coral reefs in oceans will rise 
to 15.7 billion plastic items, 
they warn that conservation 
efforts become necessary.

Six universities collaborate to make IoT more intelligent
from CONIX, A7
Then, CONIX aims to 
focus on three applica-
tions of Physically-Cou-
pled Cognitive Perceptu-
al Systems — Smart and 
Connected Communities, 
Interactive Mixed Reality 
Systems and Enhanced 
Situational Awareness.
The Interactive Mixed 
Reality Systems applica-
tion aims to better inte-
grate the physical and 
virtual components of 
the IoT, focusing primar-
ily on “short distances, 
tight latency, and large 
bandwidths.” 
The Smart and 
Connected Communities 
application looks at “net-
work size, long distances, 
and human time-scales” 
which means that it 
would require creat-
ing systems that are 
better equipped to ob-
tain and handle large 
amounts of data from the 
communities. 
The Enhanced Situ-
ational Awareness appli-
cation will combine the 
other two applications to 
“support real-time col-
laboration among hu-
mans, algorithms, and 
machines in a safe, ro-
bust, and secure manner 
in an information-rich, 
rapidly-evolving tacti-
cal environment,” which 
means that it will create 
distributed systems that 
are equipped to process 
large amounts of data ef-
?ciently and securely. 
Rowe said, “there isn’t 
a seamless way to merge 
cloud functionality with 
edge devices without a 
smarter interconnect, so 
we want to push more 
intelligence into the 
network...If networks 
were smarter, decision-
making could occur in-
dependent of the cloud at 
much lower latencies.”
With the possibilities 
represented by the IoT 
and the responsibility 
that comes with handling 
so much private data and 
information, this initia-
tive — interdisciplinary, 
farsighted, and broad 
— seems to represent a 
new era of technological 
change. 
The paper’s publication in an open-source 
journal could potentially further the threat of a 
smallpox outbreak via a bioterrorist attack.

However, it’s impossible 
for anthropologists 
to be certain whether  
Sahelanthropus walked 
upright, because no 
Sahelanthropus leg bones 
have ever been discovered.
Or have they?
In 2001, French scientist 
Michel Brunet’s expedition 
discovered a Sahelanthropus 
skull and jaw fragments in 
the African country of Chad. 
The specimen was named 
Toumaï and used to estab-
lish Sahelanthropus as a spe-
cies. When Brunet’s paper 
describing Sahelanthropus 
was published, Brunet ar-
gued that the positioning 
of the hole in Toumaï’s 
skull alone established that 
Sahelanthropus was bipedal. 
Brunet has maintained this 
position ever since.
The leader of the field 
team that uncovered the 
bones, retired geographer 
Alain Beauvilain, disagrees. 
He claims that a femur 
was found with Toumaï, and 
that its characteristics sug-
gest a species that was not 
bipedal.
This femur is surrounded 
by mystery and contradic-
tions. First, in 2004, a vol-
ley of papers was published 
on a controversy involving 
some of Toumaï’s teeth that 
called into question the 
methods of Brunet’s origi-
nal research team. 
In 2008, Beauvilain 
argued in a paper that 
through ancient human in-
terference, the bones had 
been moved from their 
original spot, calling into 
question Brunet’s estima-
tion of their age and place 
of origin. 
But most importantly, 
the field photographs of 
the bones published in Bru-
net’s original paper are not 
photographs of the bones 
as they were found — the 
photographs are recre-
ations, staged with casts of 
the bones. It’s ot necessarily 
a sign of dishonesty, but it’s 
certainly an unconventional 
choice.
But the most important 
mystery is this: despite 
Sahelanthropus’s signifi-
cance as a potential biped, 
none of the scientists who 
discovered or described 
Sahelanthropus has ever 
acknowledged the femur’s 
existence in print.
France’s National Center 
for Scientific Research even 
explicitly stated that no leg 
bones were found at the 
site. Most anthropologists, 
until recently, had no idea it 
existed. Even some of Tou-
maï’s discoverers have bare-
ly seen the femur. Harvard 
palaeoanthropologist David 
Pilbeam, who was a co-
author on Brunet’s original 
Toumaï paper, never got a 
chance to analyze the femur 
and only saw it briefly. “All 
I can recall is that it lacked 
ends and was very black,” 
he says.
Is this a scientific cover-
up? The withholding of 
anthropological evidence?
Brunet has declined to 
comment. “Our studies are 
still in progress,” he wrote 
in a brief e-mail to Nature. 
“Nothing to say before pub-
lishing.” 
According to Nature, “the 
discovery of [Toumaï] made 
Brunet famous in France, 
and especially in Poitiers, 
where a street is named 
after him.”
After Brunet’s original 
expedition, the femur was 
quietly shipped to France 
with the rest of the bones 
and ended up in the col-
lection of the University 
of Poitiers. Aude Bergeret, 
now director of the Museum 
of Natural History Victor-
Brun in Montauban, France, 
came across the femur in 
storage in 2004, when she 
was a graduate student at 
the university. “I discov-
ered the femur by chance,” 
she says. “I remember jok-
ing with another student, 
who told me, ‘You found 
Toumaï’s femur!’,” Berger-
et says. “I realized when I 
saw Roberto Macchiarelli 
that this joke was probably 
based on reality.”
Aude Bergeret asked 
Machiarelli, then head of 
the department of geosci-
ences at the University of 
Poitiers, to help her study 
the bone for a few days. 
They compared it to other 
known hominin bones and 
reached a preliminary im-
pression: the owner of this 
femur was not bipedal.
This year, Bergeret and 
Machiarelli submitted a re-
port to the Anthropological 
Society of Paris that dis-
cussed their brief impres-
sions of the femur, and ar-
gued that a formal in-depth, 
peer-reviewed analysis was 
needed. 
It would have been the 
first scientific publication to 
describe the femur, finally 
giving evidence-starved an-
thropologists real informa-
tion — but their report was 
rejected without explana-
tion.
Anthropologists are used 
to scientific understanding 
being impeded by incom-
plete evidence or unknown 
factors. But it’s less usual 
for the bureaucracy and 
politics of scientific pub-
lication to prevent extant, 
unanimously coveted evi-
dence from coming to light 
— at least with something 
as significant as the origins 
of humanity.
“We don’t know why 
it’s been kept secret,” says 
paleoanthropologist Bill 
Jungers, at Stony Brook Uni-
versity in New York. “Maybe 
it’s not even a hominin. Who 
the hell knows until some-
one can expose it.”

FANTASY, from A12
A measly 43.1 points 
from the entire lineup was 
no match for the 103 points 
from Justin Tucker Must

Beresford’s starters scored 
over 10 points. Congrats to

bronze as a fantasy football

Team Andah over Drop it 
like it’s Crock 220.3–196.5
There were no surprises 
in the race for ?fth 
place (or what ESPN’s 
website aptly calls the 
“consolation” matchup). 
The only consolation I can 
give former Publisher Jade 
Crockem is that st
affwriter Josh Andah 
has continuously beat 
teams throughout the sea-
son while never changing 
his lineup (I don’t think 
he’s ever even signed into 
his account since he cre-
ated it). Earlier in the 
season some of us in the 
league wondered if An-
dah’s strategy (or lack 
thereof) might get him into 
the playoffs, but thankfully, 
that didn’t happen.
While the Week 16 box 
score for Drop it like it’s 
Crock lacks any glaring 
zeros, underwhelming 
performances from many 
of Crockem’s starters set 
the team back. Arizona 
Cardinals wide receiver 
Larry Fitzgerald’s 27.7 
points (from nine catches, 
119 yards, and a touch-
down) was the team’s 
only bright spot. For Team 
Andah, on the other hand, 
there were several bright 
spots to go with a zero due to 
Steelers  star wide receiver 
Antonio Brown’s injury.  Los 
Angeles Chargers running 
back Melvin Gordon gained 
81 yards from 19 carries 
and a touchdown for 21.8 
points and Philadelphia 
Eagles tight end Zach Ertz 
hauled in nine catches for 
81 yards for 17.1 points.
Building on a 116.1–
104.5 lead, Team Andah 
again saw great weeks 
despite Brown’s absence. 
Seattle Seahawks wide 
receiver Doug Baldwin’s 
25 points were his most 
since his season-high 26.5 
points in Week 3, and the 
Chiefs defense also posted 
its second-best week of 
the season with 17 points. 
For Drop it like it’s Crock, 
Fitzgerald’s 13.5 points 
couldn’t carry the team. 
In the end, it seems like 
Crockem’s team name 
was well-chosen, as she 
dropped from third place 
last year to dead-last in the 
league this year.
And that’s it for the 
Tartan fantasy football 
league for the 2017-
18 season. Just like the 
unpredictable NFL sea-
son, our fantasy season 
has had some surprising 
results. Next year the ?eld 
will be quite different. All 
of our players this season, 
except for Andah and me, 
are seniors. I don’t expect 
Andah to participate again, 
so check back in the fall for 
a new crop of Tartan staff 
members that I’ve coerced 
into joining the league.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Women’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
University women’s 
basketball team visited 
New York University (NYU) 
on Friday, Jan. 26 for a 
University Athletic Associa-
tion (UAA) contest, falling 
to the Violets, 78–58, at the 
Hunter College Sportsplex. 
The Tartans are now 9–8 
and 1–5 in the UAA, while 
the Violets improve to 9–8 
and 2–4.
Sophomore Makayla 
Filiere led the Tartans with 
19 points and three steals, 
as fellow sophomore Laurel 
Pereira dropped 13 points 
and picked up three steals. 
Sophomore Laura Ochsner 
led the team with nine re-
bounds and blocked two 
shots.
Filiere scored the ?rst 
bucket of the game on a fast 
break layup and later gave 
the Tartans their last lead of 
the game, 11–10, on a three-
pointer with 4:08 to go in 
the ?rst quarter. The Violets 
then took over with a 13–4 
run to end the quarter and 
led 23–15 after the ?rst 10 
minutes.
The Violets extended 
their lead to 20 by halftime 
and led by as many as 36 
points before sophomore 
Megan Jaeb hit a three-
pointer at the third-quarter 
buzzer.
Filiere scored eight of 
the team’s 26 fourth-quarter 
points, as the Tartans shot 
7-of-10 from the ?eld, 3-of-
4 from the three-point arc, 
and 9-of-10 from the free 
throw line to cut the ?nal 
de?cit to 20 points.
On Sunday, Jan. 28 at 
Brandies University, the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
women’s basketball team 
lost a heartbreaker when 
the Judges held on for a 
55–52 win. The Tartans are 
now 9–9 and 1–6 in the UAA 
while the Judges move to 
11–6 and 3–4.
Filiere led the Tartans 
with 24 points and four 
assists while Pereira scored 
16 points off the bench.
Pereira made a layup and 
free throw to tie the score at 
8-8 after nearly six minutes 
of action in the ?rst quarter, 
but Brandeis answered with 
a three-pointer and held on 
to a 15–14 ?rst-quarter lead.
The lead changed hands 
three times in the second 
quarter with the last lead 
favoring the Tartans after 
a layup by Ochsner and a 
triple by Filiere made the 
score 24–23, with 4:19 
to go. Filiere hit her third 
three-pointer of the game 
just more than two minutes 
later and the Tartans held 
a 29–25 halftime lead after 
shooting 42.9 percent 
from the ?oor and holding 
Brandeis to 25.8 percent 
shooting for the half.
Brandeis improved its 
shooting by 11 percent in 
the third quarter and took a 
two-point lead into the ?nal 
period where they wouldn’t 
relinquish the lead. The 
Tartans pulled within two 
late but a free throw by the 
Judges with four seconds 
left forced the Tartans into 
a desperation three-pointer 
for the tie that fell short.
The Tartans ?nished the 
game shooting 38 percent 
from the ?oor as both teams 
turned the ball over 23 
times. Twenty-one offensive 
rebounds for the Judges led 
to 12 second chance points 
which made up for their 
27.4 percent shooting effort 
for the game.
The Tartans will return 
home to face New York 
University on Friday, Feb. 2, 
before hosting the Judges on 
Sunday at 2:00 p.m.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
University men’s basket-
ball team visited NYU on 
Friday, Jan. 26 for a UAA 
contest, falling 83-65 to the 
Violets at the Hunter College 
Sportsplex. The Tartans are 
now 4–13 overall and 0–6 in 
the UAA, while the Violets 
move to 9–7 and 2–4.
The Tartans were led by 
sophomore Zach Howarth’s 
19 points and seven 
rebounds. Sophomore Trent 
Suddeth scored 13 points 
with sophomore Colin 
McNeil putting in 11 points 
and dishing out four assists.
NYU pushed its ?rst-half 
lead to 11 points, bring-
ing the score to 23–12. The 
Tartans would climb back 
to trail by two at 2:27 to go 
in the ?rst half on a driving 
layup by senior Thomas 
Cook. First-year Zach 
Watson also cut the de?cit 
at two with a reverse layup 
with 22 seconds to go but a 
shot close to the buzzer by 
NYU made the score 41–37 
at the break.
Suddeth scored the ?rst 
two baskets of the second 
half to fuel a 10–3 run that 
put the Tartans up 47–44 
after McNeil put in a layup 
and Howarth sank four 
straight free throws.
The Violets would 
quickly take back the lead 
during an 11:29 stretch of 
play that included seven 
three-pointers and put the 
Violets up 19.
The Violets would ?nish 
with eight three-pointers 
for the second half and 
shot 54.8 percent from the 
?eld for the game, while 
the Tartans converted 41.9 
percent from the ?eld and 
hit just 4-of-20 from behind 
the arc.
On Sunday, Jan. 28, 
career-scoring afternoons 
for three Tartans weren’t 
enough as the Carnegie 
Mellon University men’s 
basketball team fell, 87–79, 
to Brandeis University. 
The Tartans are now 4–14 
overall and 0–7 in the UAA 
while the Judges move to 
4–13 and 1–6.
Sophomore Zach 
Howarth led the Tartans 
with a career-high 26 points 
while Watson ?nished with 
a career-best 19 points. 
Suddeth recorded his ?rst 
career double-double with 
10 points and 10 rebounds 
while sophomore Cooper 
Williams also recorded a 
career-high with 14 points.
Brandeis opened with 
a 14–2 run through the 
?rst three minutes and 52 
seconds of the game. Over 
the next seven minutes, the 
Tartans used a 16-3 run to 
take their ?rst lead of the 
game when Howarth hit 
a three-pointer from the 
corner, making the score 
18–17.
After the Tartans took 
their ?rst lead with nine 
minutes to go, the advantage 
changed hands four times 
before Williams hit a trey 
fueling a 10–4 run to end 
the period with the Tartans 
up 36–30.
The dribble-drive for a 
score and the drive-and-
kick for a three-pointer 
worked for the Tartans in 
the later portion of the ?rst 
half as Watson ?nished the 
half with 10 points on four 
driving layups and Howarth 
scored 15 on 3-of-3 shooting 
from the arc and three 
driving buckets.
The Tartans shot 55.6 
percent from long range 
and 45.2 percent from the 
?oor in the ?rst half while 
the Judges converted 41.4 
percent from the ?oor and 
hit just 2-of-9 three-point 
attempts.
Carnegie Mellon ex-
tended its lead to 10 before 
Brandeis rattled off a 14–4 
run to tie the game at 44-
all with 13:53 to go. First-
year Daniel Weiss drained 
a three-pointer on the next 
possession and the Tartans 
kept the lead until Brandeis 
had an 8–0 run to lead 54–
49 with 11:12 to play.
A string of free throws 
and a jumper by Howarth 
brie?y gave back the lead 
to the Tartans, 57–56, but 
the Judges hit nine of their 
?nal 18 shots and led by as 
many as 10 points before 
withstanding a Tartan rally 
to earn the 87–79 victory.
Carnegie Mellon will re-
turn home to face New York 
University on Friday, Feb. 2, 
at 8:00 p.m.

Super Bowl Preview: Can the Eagles pull the upset?
BRAD PUSKAR
Junior Staffwriter
When I saw that the 
Pittsburgh Pirates had 
traded Andrew McCutchen, 
face of the franchise and 
former National League 
MVP, to the San Francisco 
Giants for a young, untested 
relief pitcher and a minor 
league out?elder, I wasn’t 
as shocked as I think many 
Pirates fans were. The 
general consensus was, 
especially after the Gerrit 
Cole trade to the Houston 
Astros, that McCutchen 
would be gone for sure this 
offseason. Fans would have 
needed a miracle to get the 
club to extend McCutchen’s 
contract.
I was still hurt, mostly 
because of the terrible 
return the Pirates got for 
him. We really couldn’t have 
snagged anyone that brings 
a bit more of a veteran 
presence to the team? But 
the damage was done, so 
the only thing left to do is 
look forward to this season, 
if you even want to support 
the Bucs anymore.
So, Pirates fans, what is 
there left to love about this 
team? What could be the 
ray of sunshine in an other-
wise gloomy offseason?
Their names are Josh 
Bell and Jameson Taillon, 
of course. Even during the 
2017 season, reporters 
were looking at Bell, 
a well-spoken, power-
hitting ?rst baseman, and 
seeing his potential to lead 
the Pirates as their new 
franchise player. After a 
record-breaking rookie 
year, the only thing I can 
possibly hope for from Bell 
is more consistency as he 
tries to ?ll the shoes left by 
McCutchen.
In Taillon’s case, it’s a 
little less obvious. After 
the Bucs ?ipped Cole for 
a couple of seemingly 
lackluster players (more 
on that later), the rationale 
in my mind was that the 
Pirates already have Taillon 
in their pocket as a young, 
developing ace. He’s a stud 
on the mound, and although 
he had a bit of a rough patch 
after returning from his 
cancer surgery, everything 
seems to be set up for Jamo 
to take his place as the 
Pirates’ new ace pitcher.
Another thing to 
celebrate is the extension 
of ?ame-throwing closer 
Felipe Rivero’s contract, 
so if we can make it to 
the 9th inning, we have 
a good chance that he’ll 
hold it down for us. The 
two young main pieces we 
got in exchange for Cole 
from Houston — pitcher 
Joe Musgrove and third 
baseman Colin Moran — 
seem like they have the 
potential to blossom in 
Pittsburgh.
The two of them were 
sitting deep in the depth 
chart on an extremely 
talented Astros roster. 
Musgrove was thrown 
into a relief role because 
the Astros had too many 
incredible starting pitchers 
already, and Colin Moran 
would never see signi?cant 
playing time behind Alex 
Bregman. There was no way 
for either of the two players 
to make an impact on the 
star-studded reigning World 
Series champions.
However, on in a smaller 
team with a lot less talent on 
the roster, we could see both 
of them become reliable 
— perhaps even great — 
players. Musgrove could 
become a great starter and  
justify the Bucs’ dumping 
of Cole. Moran may ?ll out 
our hole at third base and 
become a real power threat. 
Plus, he’s got a killer beard.
Trading McCutchen 
closes the curtain on an era 
of Pittsburgh baseball that 
had many lows, but also 
many highs. I choose to look 
forward to this new team of 
young blood, and be excited 
about the future.

Super Bowl LII pits the 
old against the new — the 
veritable dynasty that is 
Tom Brady and the New 
England Patriots versus Nick 
Foles and the Philadelphia 
Eagles. It has been thirteen 
years since the Eagles were 
last in the Super Bowl, after 
losing to none other than the 
Patriots in 2005. Offensively, 
the teams were neck and 
neck throughout the regular 
season, each averaging 
exactly 28.6 points a game. 
Both teams went 13-3 
for the season, and both 
?nished at the top of their 
respective conferences. 
Since the season began, 
these two teams have been 
on a collision course for the 
Super Bowl.
It is unfair to call the 
Eagles the underdogs. 
Although the odds are 
heavily in the Patriots’ favor, 
the Eagles have shown 
surprising resilience after 
the loss of starting quarter-
back Carson Wentz before 
the postseason began. Foles 
has thrown for 598 yards in 
two playoff games, and the 
Eagles boasted the third-
best rushing offense during 
the season, proving them-
selves to be a double threat. 
In order to get the edge on 
the offensive juggernaut 
that is New England, 
Philadelphia must empha-
size high scoring drives.
Foles has established 
himself as a competent 
back-up quarterback in 
the postseason thus far, 
including a dominant 
performance against the 
Minnesota Vikings in the 
NFC Championship, but 
there is little evidence 
from past regular season 
performances to back this 
up. He must be willing to 
shoulder the responsibility 
of leading the Eagles with 
renewed vigor, and must 
outperform one of the best 
quarterbacks in recent 
memory.
The Patriots, far and away 
a more passing-focused 
team, lead the league with 
the most productive offense, 
averaging 394.2 yards per 
game. The Eagles’ defense, 
ranked fourth in the NFL, 
will need to focus on 
shutting down Tom Brady 
and the Patriot’s offense 
early and often, especially 
tight end Rob Gronkowski, 
who averaged 15.7 yards 
per reception and led the 
Patriots with 69 receptions, 
and is coming off a head 
injury sustained in the AFC 
Championship.
The Patriots have become 
notorious for their late-
game comebacks, and this 
perseverance will give them 
their best shot in defeating 
the Eagles. Championship 
experience is likely to come 
into play, as very few of the 
Eagles’ starters have played 
in a Super Bowl, and none as 
a member of the Eagles. The 
Patriots, however, have won 
?ve titles under head coach 
Bill Belichick, each secured 
by the performance of 
Brady. With two teams that 
have performed similarly 
throughout the year, this 
might be the edge the 
Patriots need to win a back-
to-back championship, and 
what would be their third 
championship in four years.
The teams will go head-
to-head at 6:30 p.m. EST on 
Sunday, Feb. 4.

Fantasy Football: Easy Breesy wins the Tartan crown
MARIKA YANG
Sports Editor
Welcome to the ?nal 
Tartan fantasy football 
recap of the season! 
After soundly beating my 
team, Third String Team, 
defending champion and 
former Editor-in-Chief India 
Price’s Yes We Cam faced 
off against former Sports 
Editor Ian Tanaya’s Easy 
Breesy, who just edged out 
contributing editor Lula 
Beresford’s Justin Tucker 
Must (not) Die to make it to 
the Tartan league’s version 
of the Super Bowl.
In the end, Easy Breesy 
defeated Yes We Cam 
243.9–210.9 to take the 
championship crown. It’s a 
?tting conclusion to Tanaya’s 
tenure as Sports Editor and 
his time at Carnegie Mellon.
Easy Breesy over Yes We 
Cam 243.9–210.9
Just like how the New 
England Patriots are back 
in the Super Bowl this 
season, this matchup was 
a familiar one for both 
Tanaya and Price, who 
competed in the 2016-17 
Tartan championship. Last 
year, Price beat Tanaya by 
only two points. This year, 
Tanaya made sure that 
didn’t happen again.
With strong Week 16 
performances from Buffalo 
Bills running back LeSean 
McCoy, Kansas City Chiefs 
running back Kareem 
Hunt, Atlanta Falcons 
wide receiver Julio Jones, 
and Patriots tight end Rob 
Gronkowski, Tanaya built 
a 20-point lead over Price, 
who suffered from sub-10 
weeks from four of her play-
makers. Easy Breesy was 
leading 124.11–104.5 going 
into Week 17.
The ?nal week of the 
NFL regular season saw 
Yes We Cam perform 
marginally better, including 
24.4 points from Miami 
Dolphins wide receiver 
Jarvis Landry, 17.7 points 
from Minnesota Viking wide 
receiver Stefon Diggs, and 
a robust 15 points from the 
Pittsburgh Steelers defense. 
Easy Breesy suffered from a 
sub-par performance from 
McCoy, and from the fact 
that Gronkowski did not 
play. However, with New 
Orleans Saints running 
back Alvin Kamara’s 128 
total yards from scrimmage 
and 106-yard kickoff return 
touchdown that led to a 
whopping 30.8 points, Easy 
Breesy easily maintained 
a comfortable lead, taking 
home the title.
Justin Tucker Must (not) 
Die over Third-String Team 
183–111.2
In the competition for 
third place, Beresford’s team 
completely clobbered mine, 
which lived up to its name. If 
I’m being completely honest, 
I believe I could’ve had a 
chance to make it close if I 
remembered to adjust my 
lineup. But alas, I didn’t.
After Week 16, the teams 
were relatively close, with 
Justin Tucker Must (not) 
Die leading 80–68.1. The 
team ensured the lead with 
15.6 points from Patriots 
quarterback Tom Brady and 
20.7 points from Steelers 
running back Le’Veon Bell. 
Despite 17.5 points from 
Chiefs quarterback Alex 
Smith, a collective 14.8 
points from ?ve of my nine 
starters was too much to 
overcome.
In Week 17, my incompe-
tence really showed. For a 
third-year fantasy player, 
I made a fool of myself by 
forgetting to bench four of 
my nine starters who didn’t 
even play.

On getting your life together
Dear Izzy,
I’m only 20 and it feels like I’m having a midlife 
crisis. Well, I guess maybe in this case I’m having 
an early life crisis. I’ve had a great time taking 
my intro classes and some electives in subjects 
I’m interested in. But I feel like at the start of 
my sophomore spring, I should have more of my 
life together. I’m starting to realize that I don’t 
know what I want to do after graduation – I don’t 
know whether I want to go to grad school, or 
to stay for a masters degree, or to just get the 
heck out of Carnegie Mellon and apply for a job. 
I don’t even want to start thinking about any of 
that. I’ve just realized that for a lot of my life I 
really don’t know what I want to do at all, and 
additionally there’s a lot of things that I love and 
I’m not sure how to combine them into something 
that I’ll want to do in the future. I know this is a 
pretty loaded question, but how do I get my life 
together?
Sincerely,
So Over Planning Heavily Out My Overwhelming 
Remaining Endeavors
Dear SOPHOMORE,
First of all, I think I can say with certainty that no 
one has their life together at the age of 20. Yes, 
this is your sophomore spring, but it’s also only 
your sophomore spring. There is still a world of 
possibilities around you and so many areas of 
study that you can still explore. Your interests 
could even change during your junior and 
senior years. So if you still feel like you’re at a 
crossroads at this stage in your life, don’t worry, 
so is most of the world. But if you’re pretty certain 
about what you want to do in life, or you still 
want to get a head start on planning your future, 
that’s okay too.
So, I have some bad news: I am also only 20, 
so I might not be able to give you the older, 
wiser perspective that might better benefit you. 
But you know who probably will have that kind 
of outlook and experience? Your advisor. Yes, I 
know it sounds like very typical advice straight 
from an Orientation Counselor, but if anything, 
your advisor should be able to connect you to 
resources that will help you learn more about 
what you can do after leaving Carnegie Mellon 
and further refine your interests.
If you want to take a self-reflecting approach 
to this question, take a moment out of your day 
and analyze your life a little bit. Think, “What 
do I like about what I’m studying? What do I 
not like? What do I want to change? What do 
I want to take with me going forward?” Try 
doing this every week, so you can keep yourself 
informed throughout your year. It also will help 
you focus on your work during those moments in 
the semester when it starts to wane and you need 
to push through hard assignments, projects, and 
exams.
But most importantly, I want to emphasize that 
you are not alone. Many people have gone 
through this at some point in their lives, whether 
it be during their freshman year while dealing 
with being away from home for the first time, 
or during their last possible point during their 
undergraduate studies, senior spring. So don’t 
be afraid to reach out. Other students and your 
friends can be your best resource, because 
they’ve been in your shoes and know first-hand 
what it’s like to be a student here. They know 
how to handle the little crises that love to spring 
up in your life like weeds. And from what I’ve 
experienced, your friends as well as other people 
around Carnegie Mellon will always help give 
you the tools you need to pull those weeds out no 
matter what.
Love,
Izzy

Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Mario’s Shadyside
If you’re part of the 21+ crowd and you go to 
Carnegie Mellon, you’ve probably found yourself 
out and about in Shadyside at least once. Whether 
it’s fighting to get a dollar drink at Stack’d before 
the clock strikes midnight or just standing around 
a table at Will Penn, Shadyside is a staple for 
those of us who are looking to enjoy a drink but 
are too lazy to go to South Side. My friends and 
I found ourselves tired of the same old routine 
with the same old people at Will Penn but still too 
unmotivated to make it all the way to Southside. 
Our criteria for the night was very simple: we 
wanted to go out in Shadyside, but we didn’t 
want to go to Will Penn or Stack’d or anywhere 
else where the population is at least 70 percent 
Carnegie Mellon students. This led us to find 
ourselves standing at a table in Mario’s East Side 
Saloon.
The location: Right at the corner of Walnut and 
Bellefonte, it’s almost impossible to miss this place. 
It’s easily accessible by bus or by foot (or by Lyft if 
you’re as lazy as I am). Its location makes it easy 
to jump from Mario’s to another nearby bar, so 
even if you don’t start your night there, you could 
end it there.
The drinks: I tend to stick to classic drinks like 
rum and coke or whiskey sour. I really didn’t 
go off book here, so I can’t speak on whatever 
specialty drinks they have. But I will say that 
aside from dollar drinks at Stack’d, these are the 
cheapest drinks I’ve found so far in Shadyside. 
At $4 a piece, my bill was considerably less than 
if I had gone to Will Penn or Stack’d, both of 
which regularly offer $5+ drinks. There are a few 
different bars in Mario’s, one downstairs and a 
few upstairs. Downstairs, all the drinks are given 
in glass cups whereas upstairs you’re given plastic. 
Despite the change, the drinks are still the same 
price which upset me for like 10 seconds, but the 
atmosphere upstairs is so nice, I got over it quickly.
The vibe: Walking in, the place is a bit 
underwhelming. The first floor has a few tables and 
a bar, and it is probably the most saloony part of 
the entire place. Upstairs has a deck with wooden 
tables and and a nice atmosphere. The disconnect 
between the first floor and the upper deck is wild. 
The second floor feels like a rooftop bar in a cool, 
hip part of town. Most of the place is standing 
room, and you feel right in the middle of all the 
action. The crowd is much different than other 
Shadyside staples with many of the people being 
in their mid-20s. Although it’s only a hop and a 
skip away from an underage crowd using their 
fakes to sneak into Stack’d, it feels worlds away as 
far as the vibe.
Lit or nah: It depends on what time you go. We 
arrived around 10:30 p.m., and I won’t say it 
was totally lit, but maybe just a little dim. By 
the time midnight rolled around, though, it was 
considerably more crowded and a lot more lit. So 
its lit potential, lit-tential if you will, is pretty high. 
It’s a great place to go if one of your favorite 
things to do at a bar is socialize. With much of the 
place being standing room, you’re forced to stand 
next to someone you don’t know, which makes it 
easy to strike up a conversation. I’ll definitely be 
coming back next time I want an off-campus field 
without going the off-campus distance.
For those nights when you’re too lazy to go to South Side

Mike Wu talks about CantoMando in Doherty Hall 
2210 at Carnegie Mellon University.
layout by Caleb Miller | Publisher
This past Saturday, Jan. 27, Toronto-based, 
Asian-Canadian YouTube group CantoMando 
came to Carnegie Mellon University. Hosted by 
the Carnegie Mellon student organizations Big 
Straw Magazine, Asian Students Association, 
and Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture, 
roughly a hundred students from Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh showed 
up for the trio’s first ever event held on a college 
campus.
Started in 2016 by Sheldon Ho, and later joined 
by his friends Edward Leung and Mike Wu, 
CantoMando is a YouTube channel that har-
nesses comedy not only for the sake of laughs, 
but also to bring focus to important issues facing 
Asians in a more light-hearted way.
Growing up, all three had their own set of dif-
ficulties as American-born Chinese (ABCs), which 
they each highlighted throughout the event. 
Sheldon grappled with his identity, trying to 
determine who he wanted to be and who he 
wanted to be associated with; Mike had trouble 
accepting his Chinese name, especially around 
his classmates (most of whom misheard his name 
as Moose Chin); Edward struggled with coming 
to terms with the racism he faced both by people 
of other races, and even Asians, who were 
swayed by the opinions of others.
Utilizing stock images, personal photos, memes, 
and the occasional badly-timed slideshow transi-
tion to their advantage throughout the event, 
CantoMando never ceased to capture the audi-
ence’s attention with both intentional and unin-
tentional humor. While laughter was consistently 
abundant, much like their videos, CantoMando’s 
talk at Carnegie Mellon masterfully incorporated 
humor with seriousness as members shared their 
stories as ABCs.
In the end, however, despite these difficult situa-
tions, they learned — and continue to learn — to 
accept who they were. They were inspired to 
bring awareness based on the struggles they 
had growing up and discuss important issues 
such as stereotypes, identity, and racial tension. 
They are seeking to help other ABCs and Asians 
feel more comfortable with embracing their cul-
tures and identities.
Although I wasn’t super familiar with 
CantoMando going into the event, each member 
of the CantoMando team’s story was engaging, 
inspiring, and relatable. It was eye-opening to 
hear about their experiences and truly recognize 
how everyone has gone through similar identity 
crises.
I’ve always had trouble, like Ho, figuring out 
who I am and where I belong. Especially as 
someone who is neither a first-generation ABC 
nor fully Asian, I’ve never felt fully comfortable 
expressing my views. I didn’t feel like my experi-
ences were valid or qualified enough, and yet as 
I listened to CantoMando talk, I found that I still 
shared a lot of similar worries and experiences. 
Growing up, I didn’t really embrace any of my 
roots, kind of floating in a limbo. Since coming 
to Carnegie Mellon, though, I’ve been able to 
grow and have had the chance to start discover-
ing who I am and where I belong.
As cliché as it may sound, CantoMando made 
me realize how important it is for everyone to 
embrace their identities and find communities 
that accept them for who they are. They crucially 
emphasized, however, that embracing our own 
cultures does not mean we should shut out those 
who are different and have differing views.
As Leung discussed, when he was faced with a 
situation of racism, he was initially angry and 
wanted to hate others. However, with time to 
reflect, he realized it was not the way to go or 
resolve conflict. He wanted to bring awareness

embrace their identities”

to the issues and not be divided over them. He 
asserted how important it was to not stereotype 
or try to fit people into boxes based on their 
race, no matter who they are.
CantoMando continuously discussed how prob-
lematic it was to be seen only for the color 
of their skin and not for the content of their 
character, yet Leung took it a step farther. At 
one point, he was faced with a dilemma. On 
social media, he saw a post that depicted three 
“white” guys mocking Chinese culture. Another 
account commented on the post, essentially 
saying that those three guys were racist and 
they represented all “white” people’s attitudes 
toward other cultures. However, Leung decided 
to respond and expressed his disbelief, correct-
ing the commenter’s blanket statement saying 
that only “some white people” were like that. 
However, many of his followers and viewers 
voiced that they felt betrayed by the stance he 
took. To be seen as betraying his race merely 
for not agreeing that all white people are bad 
was disheartening, especially as someone 
who strongly advocates for people like him 
and brings awareness to Asian-Canadian and 
Asian-American struggles.
Divisiveness will never solve any problems or 
reverse any negative views. While it may be 
easier to cut yourself off from people who 
hurt you and lose all respect for them, making 
assumptions and associating all people as bad 
or good based on the color of their skin causes 
more harm than it heals.
Ultimately, CantoMando’s university debut 
was a success. Achieving the perfect balance 
between being meaningful and funny, the 
initially nervous group had nothing to worry 
about, evoking laughter and inspiring many 
Asian students with their stories and experi-
ences.

---------------------------------------------------

Competitive figure skater and Olympic silver 
medalist Nancy Kerrigan was a symbol of 
American class and elegance. She came from a 
family that supported her figure skating career 
right from the beginning. She was poised and 
graceful, the epitome of femininity and beauty. 
Tonya Harding was quite the opposite. But 
despite these differences, both Nancy Kerrigan 
and Tonya Harding joined the ranks as some of 
the best, if not the best, female figure skaters in 
the world.
Known most infamously for becoming embroiled 
in the assault of competitor Nancy Kerrigan, 
Tonya Harding was and is much more than the 
infamous scandal. I, Tonya paints a complex 
portrait of Tonya, her family, and the fascinat-
ing details surrounding “the incident.”
Tonya (Margot Robbie) was born and raised 
in Portland, Oregon and began skating at the 
age of three. Tonya was, by no means, the 
expected image of a young figure skater. She 
enjoyed hunting, mechanics, and drag racing — 
things she picked up from her father before he 
left both her and her mother alone in Portland. 
From then on, LaVona (Allison Janney), her 
mother, raised Tonya by herself. I, Tonya makes 
it clear that despite LaVona’s dedication to 
Tonya’s figure skating training and career, 
LaVona both mentally and physically abuses 
Tonya for much of her life, ultimately driving 
Tonya into the arms of abusive boyfriend Jeff 
Gillooly (Sebastian Stan), whom she married 
when she was just 19 years old.
Despite the abuse, and the need to work sev-
eral jobs to support her and Jeff, Tonya trained 
for hours on end to become one of the best 
figure skaters in the world: She took first place 
in Skate America and Nations Cup, as well as 
second in World Championship Skating and the 
U.S. Olympic Figure Skating Festival. Her top 
competitor was always Nancy Kerrigan.
Nancy Kerrigan was a crowd favorite. For 
many Americans, she was their sweetheart. For 
the judges, she represented everything good 
in women’s figure skating. Though Tonya’s ath-
letic ability was unmatched, her presentation 
— composed largely of inexpensive homemade 
costumes — would never be as crowd-pleasing 
as Nancy, who could afford any expense 
necessary, and Tonya knew that.
Nevertheless, Tonya persisted and became the 
first American woman (and second woman in 
the world) to attempt and land the triple axel. 
Finally, she was getting the recognition and 
love she had dreamed of and always deserved. 
I, Tonya shows a hard truth behind the success 
— it doesn’t always translate to happiness. The 
success drove a wedge between Tonya and 
Jeff, whose relationship only grew more violent.
The movie uses a pseudo-documentary por-
trayal of the character’s lives, and it proved 
to be a strong and effective way of letting the 
audience inside Tonya’s struggles. She wanted 
to leave Jeff and continue on in the pursuit 
of a life without abuse. But, in her struggle to 
be seen in the public and by the figure skat-
ing association as part of a “perfect American 
family,” she decides against splitting up their 
relationship.
Tonya makes the 1992 Winter Olympics team 
and, despite a series of mishaps with her 
skates and laces, places fourth overall. She 
is filled with mixed emotions, and Margot 
Robbie is excellent in showcasing Tonya’s clash-
ing moods. Tonya is still the victim of spousal 
abuse, and she’s losing the love and respect of 
the figure skating world.
For a few months, figure skating takes a 
back seat in Tonya’s life. But, in 1992, it was 
decided that the Olympics would be moved to 
1994, and Tonya now has a chance at mak-
ing the team. She is more determined than

ever to prove her worth to a world filled with 
opposition. The cards are stacked against her, 
but she’s driven and takes every chance she 
can to get better. There’s one thing — or person 
— however, holding her back and she fails to 
realize it. Jeff Gillooly ultimately leads to the 
fall of Tonya’s career.
Leading up to the Olympics, Tonya began 
receiving death threats that left her too ner-
vous to take the ice, leaving her with limited 
practice time. Jeff, along with his up-to-no-good 
friend Shawn, gets the idea to send Nancy 
Kerrigan similar letters in the hopes that it will 
rattle her nerves and level the playing field. 
Shawn, in a selfish attempt at living out some 
sort of infamous attack, takes it upon himself to 
go beyond death threats. He hires two men to 
attack Nancy Kerrigan. The movie showcases 
the overwhelming confusion that both Jeff and 
Tonya experience in response to this. Tonya 
immediately suspects Jeff’s involvement.
Some argue that her hesitation to come for-
ward with suspicion was ultimately her own 
fault. While this line of thinking isn’t completely 
off the mark, I, Tonya highlights how hard 
it was for Tonya to ever cross her husband 
— doing so would inevitably lead to further 
physical, emotional, and mental abuse at her 
expense. Though she eventually comes for-
ward, she does so a little too late. To make 
matters worse, Jeff, overcome with anger at 
Tonya’s decision to finally divorce him, tells 
the court that Tonya was integral in planning 
an attack on Nancy Kerrigan. However, it 
seems fairly clear that Tonya’s involvement 
starts and ends with the decision to send death 
threats to Nancy’s practice arena. After all, 
Tonya wanted to prove she was the best, and 
she wanted to prove that she was a superior 
skater to Nancy. I, Tonya makes sure the audi-
ence fully realizes how important it was for 
Tonya to get the opportunity to not just com-
pete in the Olympics, but to compete against 
Nancy Kerrigan. It wasn’t in Tonya’s interest 
to jeopardize Nancy’s chances at getting 
to compete.
Though the media and public opinion jumped 
immediately to the conclusion that Tonya was 
a vicious competitor who wanted nothing 
more than to win that gold Olympic medal, 
I, Tonya does a fantastic job of presenting 
the details of the incident with all of the grey 
areas and blurred lines that something so com-
plex deserves. In the movie, Tonya describes 
the media’s coverage as abusive. “You’re all 
my abusers, too,” remarks Tonya. The movie 
doesn’t erase Tonya’s involvement in lying to 
save her husband. But it allows the audience to 
sympathize with a woman who faced nothing 
but hatred and abuse, a woman who wanted 
nothing more than a fair shot at life. Tonya had 
been taken advantage of and manipulated, and 
she made irrevocable mistakes that would for-
ever haunt her.
One of the most heart-wrenching scenes in 
I, Tonya comes toward the end of the movie 
where, following her eighth place finish in the 
Olympics (with Nancy Kerrigan taking sec-
ond), a trial for the assault resulted in Tonya’s 
lifelong ban from any figure skating associa-
tion. Margot Robbie’s emotional expression is 
phenomenal, and the audience’s heart breaks 
along with Tonya’s as you realize that she had 
lost everything she had ever known.
I, Tonya sheds new light on an infamously dark 
spot of American figure skating. The movie forc-
es the audience to leave preconceived notions 
of Tonya Harding behind and be open to the 
idea that not everything is as it seems. It allows 
you to question the “facts” you’ve previously 
been told and gives a new voice to someone 
whose heartbreaking story of abuse and per-
severance had been tossed aside and replaced 
with a media-built portrayal of a fame-hungry 
villain.

These words, spoken by the main character’s 
idol, Ernesto de la Cruz (Benjamin Bratt), are 
the heart and soul of Disney Pixar’s latest film, 
Coco. Lively, heartwarming, and genuine, Coco 
shows us the importance of family and appre-
ciation for cultural traditions. Directed by Pixar 
veterans Lee UnKrich — director of Toy Story 
2, Monsters Inc., Finding Nemo — and Adrian 
Molina, who directed Monsters University 
and The Good Dinosaur, the film featured 
the voices of Anthony Gonzalez, Gael García 
Berna, and Benjamin Bratt. The film broke box 
office records in Mexico, passing The Avengers 
to become the highest grossing movie in the 
country’s history, and for good reason.
The animated film follows Miguel Rivera 
(Anthony Gonzalez), a young boy with a 
lifelong dream of becoming an accomplished 
musician. After his great-great grandfather 
had left the family to pursue his own dream of 
music, the Rivera household, hurt and angry, 
established a generations-long ban on music. 
As his family prepares for the holiday Día de 
los Muertos, Miguel learns of a music contest: 
an opportunity to do what he loves most. He 
takes the advice of his deceased idol, Ernesto 
de la Cruz, and seizes his moment by literally 
seizing de la Cruz’s guitar from his altar. This 
act transports Miguel to the Land of the Dead, 
where he becomes a part of the spirit world. 
“Never 
underestimate 
the power of 
music...”
In order to return home, Miguel learns that he 
must receive a blessing from a family member, 
and attempts to find them in the afterlife. 
Along the way, he meets the endearing 
trickster Hector (Gael Garcia Bernal), and 
together, the two of them travel through the 
Land of the Dead to reveal the secrets of his 
family heritage.
Coco presents a classic coming-of-age story, 
one that seems all too familiar, especially 
when looking at Pixar’s past films; and yet, 
it remains fresh and original, presenting a 
different perspective on familial ties through 
a new cultural lens. The importance of family, 
deceased or alive, is an enormous part of Latin 
culture, and is an enormous part of this movie. 
Miguel’s secret passion for music is made even 
more relatable when we consider the authority 
and influence elder family members can have, 
and his yearning for acceptance and support 
strikes a familiar chord. While honoring 
deceased family members isn’t a common 
aspect of American culture, the film makes us 
consider the importance of remembrance. In 
the film, the spirits in the Land of the Dead can 
experience something called a “Final Death,” 
which occurs when the last living person 
forgets them. As sad as it sounds, the film 
uses this concept to remind audience members 
to celebrate the lives of their own ancestors.

Rather than coming across as sorrowful in 
these particular moments, Coco is vivacious 
and compassionate, urging audience members 
to celebrate their own life and the lives of 
others.
Right from the beginning, the film displays 
utterly beautiful visuals: the history of the 
Rivera family is told through moving papel 
picados (tissue paper banners with designs 
made by paper cutting), and the bustling 
neighborhood is full of colorful characters 
and mariachis. The story is intertwined with a 
swirl of bright saturated oranges, yellows, and 
blues, making the Land of the Dead even more 
fantastical and grand. The amount of love and 
care that went into this movie is evident in the 
sheer amount of detail put into the visuals, 
from the individual wrinkles in Grandma 
Coco’s face, to the millions of glowing orange 
flower petals that form the bridge to the 
afterlife.
Pixar films have always included music 
that pulls at our heart-strings, and Coco is 
no exception. From big show tunes to soft 
lullabies, every song features a Spanish guitar, 
Miguel’s instrument of choice, which adds to 
the Latin style of the film. The most memorable 
songs in the film are “Récuerdame” (or 
“Remember Me”), a tear-inducing lullaby; “La 
Llorona,” an energetic Latin pop song; and 
“Un Poco Loco,” a cheerful and humorous love 
song. While every song has a similar Latin 
flavor, each character has their own style, 
from de la Cruz’s grand spectacles to Miguel’s 
innocent and fun folk songs, adding another 
layer of personality to the film’s characters. 
Despite the many songs, the film never drags; 
in fact, every song serves a purpose and drives 
the story forward, giving the film life and 
exuberance.
But by far, the most successful aspect of 
Coco is its wholehearted embracement of 
Mexican culture. Not only is it a film about 
a Mexican family on a traditional holiday, it 
also features an entirely Latinx cast and a vast 
number of Latinx creators, animators, and 
consultants. It takes an opportunity to educate 
without sounding didactic, allowing audiences 
to experience for themselves the joy these 
cultural traditions bring. The film takes every 
opportunity to be as real and accurate as pos-
sible, from the Día de los Muertos -inspired 
designs of the spirits in the afterlife, to Miguel’s 
abuela’s weapon of choice — a chancla. It not 
only emphasizes the importance of diversifying 
our perspectives, it also emphasizes the need 
for understanding those perspectives. In a time 
where anti-immigrant sentiment seems to be 
rising, much of Latinx culture can be miscon-
strued or appropriated, and Coco presents us 
with a unique look into their rich culture and 
traditions in order to better understand it. The 
creators of the film and the film itself show us 
how cultural appreciation should be done and 
encourages the audience to take a moment to 
understand their perspective.
While it can be nearly impossible to pick 
a favorite Pixar film, Coco is easily in the top 
three. It’s a film that will make you cry, laugh, 
and cry again, and give you a deep appre-
ciation for your own family. While it may be 
marketed as a kids movie, it is most definitely 
enjoyed by audiences of all ages and back-
grounds. The film is simultaneously socially 
conscious and celebratory, providing a fun and 
appreciative look into Mexico’s rich culture. 
The combination of the endearing characters, 
spirited music, and astounding visuals makes 
Coco an absolute must-see.

F
or this spring semester, I 
decided that I would explore 
a greater diversity of cui-
sines that are being served in 
Pittsburgh. Whenever I went 
out to eat in the previous semesters, I 
would usually eat at places serving East 
Asian cuisines. While there are many 
delicious East Asian restaurants in the 
area, there are many eateries serving 
great foods from other cultures as well. 
Some of the local places serving Middle 
Eastern cuisine, in particular, have 
become a few of my new favorite res-
taurants to go to. Ali Baba in Oakland, 
as well as Naya and Aladdin’s in 
Squirrel Hill are just a few of the Middle 
Eastern restaurants closest to campus.
Most recently, I was able to eat at 
Aladdin’s for dinner. Aladdin’s is a chain 
restaurant that mainly serves Lebanese-
American cuisine. They offer a variety 
of dishes, from rolled pita sandwiches 
to “pitzas” to shish kabobs, all at decent 
prices. I don’t remember ever eating 
anything from there before my visit, so I 
did not know what to expect.
Hospitality towards guests is a sig-
nificant part of the restaurant’s draw. 
Aladdin’s claim to provide Lebanese 
hospitality proved to be true: immedi-
ately after entering the restaurant, my 
friend and I were greeted by a perky 
waiter who guided us to our table at 
the back of the establishment and 
eagerly introduced the menu to us. 
Since not all of our group had arrived, 
however, we held off on ordering our 
main courses first. Instead, we ordered 
the appetizer and proceeded to engage 
in small talk. The relaxed ambiance 
was perfect for that. The layout of the 
restaurant was well-planned. While I 
have felt stifled at other restaurants in 
Squirrel Hill due to the close proximity 
of different tables, this was not the case 
at Aladdin’s. The indistinct background 
chatter and clinking of cutlery provided 
a comfortable atmosphere. Even though 
the place was filling up fast, never once 
did we feel rushed by the staff.
Our appetizer arrived promptly. The 
vegetarian combo appetizer included 
hummus, tabouli salad, baba ganoush, 
falafel, and dawali. We had a basket of 
pitas to dip in the hummus, tabouli, and 
baba ganoush. We never quite finished 
our pitas before a basket of hot fresh 
ones arrived just as we were finishing 
up the current basket. The texture of 
the hummus was a little rough for my 
liking. The baba ganoush, however, 
was silky smooth, and had just the right 
amount of sour to make it excellent.
Finally, when the rest of the group 
arrived, we set about ordering our 
meals. I ordered an Aladdin’s Lamb 
Rolled pita, which came as one long 
roll encased in aluminum wrapping. 
The pita bread was nice and crunchy, 
and filled with fire-grilled lamb, toma-
toes, onions, turnips, and pickles. Tahini 
yogurt dressing was drizzled along the 
insides of the rolled pita. The blend 
of flavors was almost perfect, with the 
exception of the onion and dressing; 
there was too much of those. The lamb 
was flavorful and well seasoned with 
herbs and spices. It was surprisingly 
juicy, given that it was somewhat tough. 
I did hope it would have been more 
tender. However, for its price, the por-
tions were bountiful.
We ended off the meal with an assort-
ment of baklava — bird’s nest, lady fin-
gers, burma, and traditional diamond. 
I liked the burma baklava, whereas 
my friend preferred the traditional 
diamond. While I can comprehend the 
appeal of simple tastes, I appreciated 
the infusion of the pistachio taste to 
the sweetness of the traditional dessert. 
If you haven’t tried Aladdin’s, I would 
definitely recommend giving it a try.

The 2018 Vanity Fair 
Hollywood issue was filled 
with quite a few photoshop 
fails. From adding extra 
limbs to removing actors, this 
issue was about as exciting 
as the year’s entire awards 
season. The name of the 
game this season is account-
ability, and while for some it 
seems a bit hypocritical that 
they’re speaking out on this 
long brewing issue now after 
knowing about it for years, 
it’s still nice that strides are 
being made to bring aware-
ness to sexual assault. Some 
actors proclaiming “me too” 
and “time’s up” have still 
refused to denounce movie 
moguls, such as Woody 
Allen and Harvey Weinstein. 
However, if they can use 
some of their popularity to 
bring attention to the activists 
doing the real work, then not 
all hope is lost.
The cover features Reese 
Witherspoon and Oprah 
Winfrey embracing each 
other. Fans were quick to 
notice the addition of an 
extra leg on Witherspoon in 
the photo, but it appears that 
this was just a result of the 
way that her nude colored 
dress fell. Winfrey however 
was actually given a third 
hand in what can only be 
described as a classic pho-
toshop fail. Both stars were 
very lighthearted about it 
and jokingly tweeted about 
their third limbs. Vanity Fair 
also issued a statement and 
made an adjustment to the 
images restoring Winfrey 
back to having two hands.
The cover also features 
Tom Hanks (one of the few 
scandal-free men left in 
Hollywood), Nicole Kidman, 
Jessica Chastain, Zendaya, 
and more. Many of the 
actors adorned nude and 
black attire with the excep-
tion of Chastain, who seemed 
to be the focal point of the 
image in a red ball gown. 
I’m not exactly sure what the 
significance of this is, but it 
certainly made for a pretty 
nice picture.
In tune with the rest of 
Hollywood, Vanity Fair digi-
tally removed James Franco 
from the cover shot a few 
weeks ago before news of 
his allegations were brought 
to light. A statement from 
the magazine was released 
saying “We made a decision 
not to include James Franco 
on the Hollywood cover once 
we learned of the misconduct 
allegations against him.” 
Franco has also been shut 
out of Oscar nominations for 
The Disaster Artist despite 
winning the Golden Globe 
for best actor just a few short 
weeks ago. The actor was 
even bold enough to wear a 
Time’s Up pin to the awards, 
which quickly led his accus-
ers to come forward and call 
him out for it.
Franco reportedly knew he 
would be cut as soon as 
news of his sexual assaults 
surfaced. After appearing 
on Late Night with Seth 
Meyers, he stated that “he 
wants to fix it” if he’s done 
something wrong, but did not 
apologize to his accusers. 
He doesn’t seem remorseful 
for his actions but more so 
just sorry that he got caught 
with a very “tail between 
his legs” mentality. Being 
removed from the Vanity Fair 
cover was a small price to 
pay in comparison to what 
his accusers felt.
Despite shutting out The 
Disaster Artist, the Oscars 
made room for the racially 
insensitive Three Billboards 
Outside of Ebbing, Missouri, 
showing they can only 
really focus on one issue 
at a time. Last year it was 
#OscarsSoWhite, and they 
calmed us down by giv-
ing Moonlight the Oscar. 
With all the focus on sexual 
assault, the Academy seemed 
to think we would forget 
about the other issues and 
look the other way as Three 
Billboards slid its way into 
the best picture category, 
despite the movie sympa-
thizing with a racist cop. 
Hollywood isn’t perfect, 
this we know, but it would 
be nice if they continued 
forward with progression 
instead of taking one step 
forward and two steps back.

---------------------------------------------------

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to 
most upperclass students, except those in themed housing, a first-year residence hall or 
apartment, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in Room Selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a 
“block” of rooms near each other in one of the applicable residence halls or apartments. 
Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who 
will be responsible for setting up their block housing group on the housing application 
and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
General room selection
General Room Selection is the final phase of Room Selection. During this phase, 
students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose 
a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general Room 
Selection must apply online. They are then given a random timeslot for Room Selection.
Themed housing
Themed housing allows students to apply for housing centered around a certain 
interest or theme. Themed houses are detailed on page six of this guide.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2018–19 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in Room 
Selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Residential Education.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing permits upperclass residents of different genders to reside in 
the same room. 
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2018–19 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the Room Selection process, visit  
www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room Selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), block 
housing, general room selection, themed housing, RA/CA housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three Room Selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room 
selection. However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room Selection begins on Feb. 21, so all 
students returning next year should be actively thinking about their housing plans for the 2018–19 school year.

Living on campus vs. living off campus 
Questions to ask and tools to help you decide
Deciding whether or not you want to live on campus next year can be a tough decision. Both on-campus and 
off-campus living have their appeals, and the right option will almost definitely come down to each individual’s 
unique living needs.
Use the chart below to determine the costs of living off campus versus living on campus. The column on the left 
shows what is included in on-campus housing. Ask prospective landlords the cost of each of these items listed 
below and fill in the dollar amount next to the appropriate icon. For items or services that you do not believe are 
applicable to you, write 0 in the blank. Total all costs and compare to the cost of living on campus as you make 
your decision for next year. Chart provided by Housing Services.
If you do choose to live off campus next year, Carnegie Mellon’s off-campus website is a good resource: https://
offcampus.housing.cmu.edu/
Questions to ask when deciding where to live:
If you are considering moving off campus, be sure to ask 
these questions, provided by Housing Services, before you 
sign a lease:
Rent and Additional Costs
Is there an application or holding fee? If yes, what is the 
cost?
What utilities are included in the rent?
How much is the security deposit?
When is the rent due?
Leases
In case you plan to study abroad for part of the school year 
or summer, are variable lease options available (six, nine, or 
12 months)?
Is individual lease liability offered?
How many people is this unit legally zoned for? In the city 
of Pittsburgh, it is illegal for more than three unrelated indi-
viduals to live together in a residential dwelling. 
Do you have a rental license on file with the city of 
Oakland?
Will I be able to sublet my unit in the summer or for study 
abroad?
Repairs and Maintenance
Will any repairs be made to the unit prior to move in?
How quickly do you make repairs when there is a work 
request or maintenance issue?
Do you take before and after pictures to help guarantee I get 
my security deposit back?
Amenities
What type of security does the building offer?
What type of parking is offered?
What appliances are provided, and how old are they?
Who is responsible for yard maintenance and snow 
removal?

CONFLICT KITCHEN, CHIPOTLE, FUEL AND FUDDLE, AND THE PORCH. FOR STUDENTS OVER 21, 
OAKLAND HAS A SOLID GROUP OF LATE-NIGHT DESTINATIONS, SUCH AS HEMINGWAY’S, MAD 
MEX, AND A LIQUOR STORE WITH AN EXTENSIVE SELECTION. ANOTHER BENEFIT OF OAKLAND IS THE 
AVAILABILITY OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING CLOSE TO CAMPUS. OAKLAND AVENUE AND ATWOOD STREET 
ARE LINED WITH HOUSING FOR BOTH CARNEGIE MELLON AND UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH STUDENTS.
MOST PEOPLE LIVING HERE ARE ALWAYS UP FOR FUN; IF YOU’RE LOOKING FOR A QUIET 
NEIGHBORHOOD, OAKLAND MAY NOT BE YOUR CUP OF TEA. OAKLAND SHOULD BE NOTED FOR ITS 
LIVELY ATMOSPHERE AND IS IDEAL FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR COLLEGE-ORIENTED SURROUNDINGS.
OAKLAND
SHADYSIDE IS HOME TO UPPERCLASSMEN FROM CARNEGIE MELLON AND THE UNIVERSITY OF 
PITTSBURGH, GRADUATE STUDENTS, AND YOUNG WORKING PROFESSIONALS. ACCESSIBLE BY BUS, IT 
TENDS TO BE SLIGHTLY PRICIER THAN OAKLAND OR SQUIRREL HILL; HOWEVER, IT IS THE MOST CHARMING OF 
THE AREAS SURROUNDING CAMPUS, WITH ITS TREE-LINED STREETS AND BOUTIQUES. THE NEIGHBORHOOD 
IS BEST KNOWN FOR TWO THINGS: SHOPS AND BARS. WALNUT STREET IS LINED WITH A WIDE VARIETY 
OF SHOPS, AND COZY RESTAURANTS LIKE MERCURIO’S AND THE YARD GASTROPUB ARE INTERSPERSED 
AMONG THE SHOPS.
WHILE THE AREA NEAR SHADYSIDE’S BARS CAN BE PARTICULARLY LOUD FROM THURSDAY TO SUNDAY, 
SHADYSIDE IS GENERALLY A VERY RELAXED, QUIET AREA. THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS AND THE COLLEGE 
STUDENTS WHO LIVE THERE ARE DIVERSE  — FROM ARTISTS TO TECHNICAL MAJORS TO MEDICAL STUDENTS. 
SHADYSIDE IS A GREAT AREA FOR ANYONE LOOKING FOR EITHER AN ESCAPE FROM CAMPUS OR A POPULAR 
SHOPPING AND NIGHTLIFE EXPERIENCE.

NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODSHOUSING GUIDE
SQUIRREL HILL STARTS JUST UP THE BIG HILL ON FORBES AVENUE. IT IS EITHER A 20-MINUTE WALK 
OR A THREE-MINUTE BUS RIDE FROM CAMPUS, AND THE BUSES ARE VERY FREQUENT. THE COST OF 
LIVING IN SQUIRREL HILL IS HIGHER THAN IN OAKLAND, BUT LOWER THAN IN SHADYSIDE. IN ADDITION 
TO HOUSING UPPERCLASS STUDENTS FROM CARNEGIE MELLON, SQUIRREL HILL IS ALSO HOME TO 
FACULTY AND PITTSBURGH FAMILIES NOT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNIVERSITY. SQUIRREL HILL HAS A 
DIVERSITY OF RESTAURANTS, FROM THAI FOOD AT SILK ELEPHANT TO BREAKFAST AT THE ORIGINAL 
PAMELA’S DINER. THE RESTAURANTS ARE DISPERSED AMONG SMALL SHOPS, INCLUDING THOSE ON 
THE MAIN THOROUGHFARE OF FORBES AVENUE.
IT IS NOT A COLLEGE NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE OAKLAND AND SHADYSIDE, AND IT DOES NOT HAVE A 
PROMINENT BAR SCENE. IT DOES HAVE A RESIDENTIAL ATMOSPHERE, HOWEVER, THAT THE OTHER 
TWO AREAS LACK. FOR SOMEONE LOOKING FOR A SHORT RIDE OR WALK FROM CAMPUS WITH ALL THE 
NECESSITIES WITHIN WALKING DISTANCE AND A WIDE VARIETY OF CUISINES, SQUIRREL HILL MAY 
BE THE RIGHT PLACE TO LOOK FOR A HOME TO RENT.

Aiming to create a synaesthetic experience, where sensory experiences merge “to the point 
where you cannot adequately describe one sense without talking about another,” German art-
ist Ryoichi Kurokawa’s constrained surface is a bold artistic experiment that utilizes the screen 
as a canvas and light, color, sound, and movement as paints. While Kurokawa’s work is 
entirely digital, constrained surface invokes emotions to create a jolting and imaginative expe-
rience.  The work was featured in the Wood Street Galleries in the Cultural District as part of 
the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust’s Gallery Crawl, held Friday, Jan. 26 from 5:30 p.m. – 10:00 p.m.
