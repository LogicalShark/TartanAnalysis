Woodlawn Club won first place 
among the fraternity teams by virtue 
of victory in its final game on Janu­
ary sixth, and thereby gained the right 
to meet the winners in the second divi­
sion to decide the school champion­
ship. The team, composed of Hol­
lister, E. and J. C. Hobbs, Fulmer, 
Stein, Daugherty, and Wolfley played 
consistently In all of its games, losing 
but one in an extra period of time. 
Beta Theta Epsilon is assured of sec­
ond place, though it may be forced to 
share the position with Theta Xi or 
Xi Sigma Upsilon. Contrary to last 
week’s announcement, two games 
were postponed till Tuesday to pre­
vent teams appearing twice during the 
same afternoon. In the four contests 
which took place that week, Sigma 
Rho, Woodlawn Club, Theta Xi, and 
Beta Theta Epsilon were winners over 
Theta Xi, Beta Theta Epsilon, Xi Sig­
ma Upsilon, and Sigma Rho, respect­
ively.
The second division of the basket' 
ball league is assured, although the 
schedule was not announced in time 
for publication in this issue of The 
Tartan. The teams will be given due 
notice of the opening games which will 
be started as soon as possible.

To the Executive Committee:
Following is the report of the Eighth 
Annual Convention of the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association held 
at the Hotel Astor, New York City, 
on December 30, 1913:
MORNING SESSION
1. Roll call.
2. Address, by Dean Le Baron R. 
Briggs, president of the association; 
“The spirit of the gentleman has in­
creased in football to a greater extent 
than it has in baseball.
“Clean sport means clean life, and, 
in turn, clean men.”
3. Address, by Rev. Endicott Pea­
body, entitled “The Ideals of Sport in 
England and in America.”
“Sport Ideals in the U. S. are not in 
evidence, but do exist. The aim of 
sport in America is victory; the aim of 
sport in England is recreation.
“In the United States:
“A season is counted a failure if the 
game with the chief rival is lost.
“There are no general athletes in our 
colleges. Coaches are the men who are 
the most expert in their respective 
sport. Coaches are obtained at any 
cost. Her captains are made subser­
vient to the coaches.
“High standards are latent, especial­
ly in baseball when men will give up 
trying when they find they have not 
made the team.
“If a rowing crew does not make a 
good start, they stall. However, row­
ing is fairly clean.
“In football, it is considered part 
of the game to find ways of beating the 
rules. Holding, even though against 
the rules, is in evidence.
“In baseball, there is absolutely no 
standard. There are rules to cover 
every point in the game, and a police­
man on the job to see that the rules 
are enforced. A decision depends en­
tirely upon an intepretation of the 
rules. A reformation is expected.
“In England, the major sports are 
rowing, cricket and football.
"An American played in a football 
game with some Englishmen against 
another English team. The former 
were badly beaten. Walking to the 
field house, the American felt very 
down-cast over the defeat. One of his 
English team-mates overtook him, 
and said, ‘It was a jolly good game.’ 
This clearly illustrates the two differ­
ent attitudes towards (he sport.
“The absence of rules in cricket is 
very noticeable to an American. They 
play according to the spirit of the 
game. There is no rule against balk­
ing, but in one instance, where a bowler 
balked, the team was black-balled.
“The captain is the responsible man. 
The coaches are amateurs. Class 
teams are coached by the varsity men.
“Athletics and education take the 
opposite positions in the two countries. 
In England, education is aristocratic, 
while athletics are democratic. In the 
United States, it is the reverse. We 
make all go to school, but we only 
want the most efficient to take part 
in athletics.
“We need a change in our condi­
tions. The fact that professionalism 
enters through the coaching system 
spoils it.
“Either a member of the faculty 
should be made a coach, or the coach 
should be made a member of the fac­
ulty.
“Athletics teach men to know men, 
and if a man in question happens to 
be a good scholar and a good athlete, 
having been under the same super­
vision as in scholastics, we get a real 
leader of men.”
One representative took exceptions 
to the above, claiming that “recrea­
tion is the steadily increasing watch­
word in the colleges of the United 
States.”
4. Address, Dr. George W. Ehler, 
“The Regulation of Intercollegiate 
Athletics.”
“We should try to eradicate the
spirit of ’win at any cost.’ Coaching 
and athletics should be confined to the 
faculty, and be made a compulsory
part of the curriculum.
“Both faculty and association con­
trol are necessary. Neither is ade­
quate alone. Dudley says that faculty 
control should be by men who are
interested in the men and sports, and 
should not be the athletic directors. 
Exception is taken to this, inasmuch 
as the athletic directors are interested 
in both the men and the sports.
“Faculty must stop being negative, 
and must be positive now. They have 
cut out vice, but have done no build­
ing up. They must encourage and
promote athletics, and not consider 
them as a necessary evil.
“Members of the coaching and of 
the athletic staff should be picked in 
the same way as any member of the

With the opening basketball games 
of this week, the students will have a 
good chance to learn whether the var­
sity will be able to do anything with 
the teams on the schedule. The game 
tomorrow night with Pitt and the one 
on Saturday with Juniata will deter­
mine what may be expected for the 
season. Although both of the con­
tests are among the hardest on the 
schedule, we have reasonable hopes of 
winning. The recent practices have 
shown a fast team with great team- 
play as well as individual ability. The 
five men who will start against Pitt 
have perfect confidence in each other, 
and speed to spare.
Crissvvell and Tumpane will play at 
forward, Colvin will jump center, and 
Douthett and Hines will do the guard­
ing. They are five of the best players 
Tech has had for several years, but 
the chances of winning will depend 
upon their working together.
Pitt has had the advantage of a pre­
vious collegiate game, having beaten 
Metheny’s pupils from Geneva by a 
score of 28 to 24. The game was not 
remarkable in any way, so our boys 
are confident of winning from their 
fellow-citizens. Juniata , had the best 
of Penn State, which seems to indicate 
that they are as strong as in former 
years and may be feared more than 
Pitt.
Unfortunately, the idea seems to 
have been spread that the Tech var­
sity is fully made up. We have five 
good men on the squad, but the second 
string is pitifully weak. Anyone should 
know that a basketball team is not 
made up of only five men. There are 
some rattling good basketball players 
in school who have not tried for the 
varsity. The fraternity league',' just 
closed, has shown this. Lest there be 
no mistake, we will mention a few 
of these by name. Hollister, Kesner, 
Mehrton, Stein, Lapplev and Ashworth 
might anyone fit into the second string 
and have a good chance of winning a 
letter this year, not to mention the 
possibilities of improving the varsity 
next season. Here is a chance for 
“personal workers” to get busy. We 
need these men and a number of others 
not mentioned who are just as good, 
but have noc shown their talents.
Have you got your tombstone front 
ready to wear to the Prom?

PITTSBURGH, PA., JAN. 15, 1914
A CORRECTION.
We wish to make a correction of 
one item in the financial report of the 
student activities committee published 
last week. This item reads:
“$3.00 per man, 36 men... .$108.00” 
Owing to an unfortunate mistake of 
the printer, a line was omitted. The 
corrected item should read:
“Musical Clubs Insignia, $3.00 per man 
36 men ...........................................$108.00”
A FOOTBALL COACH FOR NEXT 
YEAR.
As stated in last week’s issue, a com­
mittee has been appointed to investi­
gate the merits of various football 
men, from among whom it was thought 
we might be able to secure a coach 
next year.
Among other-names mentioned has 
been prominent that of Snitzer. In 
1909 we had a coach at Carnegie who 
turned out a better team than we had 
ever had, or have had since. We 
played schools of a much higher rank 
than those we have been meeting in 
the last few years, and besides we won 
a good proportion of the games. At 
the same time the coach took a per­
sonal interest in the players, kept 
them at their studies, saw that they 
were up in the school work, and only 
a few had any trouble on account of 
deficiencies. For this reason Coach 
Snitzer was as popular with the Fac­
ulty as he was with the students.
Now the Alumni, who knew Snitzer 
better than any of the students now in
school, are enthusiastic about the pros­
pect of getting him back next year. 
The students, too—at least those who 
have interested themselves in the mat­
ter and have made an investigation 
among the Alumni and Faculty—have 
largely become hearty supporters of 
Snitzer.
Among his supporters, as a repre­
sentative student paper, The Tartan 
wishes to take its place. The career 
of football as a winter-college sport at 
Carnegie will be decided next year. 
We know that Snitzer was a success 
with this team; we know that he kept 
his players up to standard in their 
studies; we know from the record of 
the team that it was one to be proud 
of. If a new coach is tried next year 
he will be more or less of an experi­
ment. He may have all the reputa­
tion in the world as a player, he may 
have become famous as a coach, never­
theless he will have to learn to adapt 
himself to conditions at a technical 
institution; and for this reason he will 
probably have trouble the first year. 
Snitzer has met the conditions here 
and conquered them; then why experi­
ment with new men? We only hope 
that the Athletic authorities will rec­
ognize the feeling among the students 
and Alumni, and do their best to secure 
Snitzer next year, provided he will 
come.
DRINKING AMONG FRESHMEN 
IN AMERICAN UNIVER­
SITIES.
In all respects a man coming to col­
lege for his first year is more or less 
unsophisticated. His views of life 
must be adapted to conditions different 
from any he has previously been ac­
customed to; his mental horizon be­
comes broader, and at the same time 
his knowledge of his fellow-men be­
gins to be enlarged. Necessarily it 
takes more or less time for this pro­
cess of mental adjustment to complete 
itself, and it is during this period that 
the great majority of college students 
who go wrong meet their downfall.
Sometimes a first year man will get 
the idea that the proper way to cele­
brate a football victory and show his 
loyalty is to get gloriously drunk. 
Others believe that the ability to drink 
a glass of beer is a sign of true man­
hood. Of course the majority of the 
student body in any school, and es­
pecially here,, do not hold these no­
tions; nevertheless once in a while we 
run across some such idea.
A very good rule was recently adopt­
ed at Wisconsin by the student con­
ference. This rule bars Freshmen 
from saloons for the whole of their 
first year. The upper classmen are to 
see to the enforcement of the rule, and 
any Freshman caught in a saloon is 
sent home at once. Of course the rule 
will be difficult of enforcement. It 
would be hard to police all the saloons 
in a small town, and in a larger city 
it would be doubly difficult. How­
ever, no one can doubt that the prin­
ciple is right, and we hope to see a 
practical solution worked out at Wis­
consin.
Understand, we do not mean that the 
entire Freshmen class become tee­
totalers; we do not even assert that 
it would be far better if they did. But 
by the end of the first year a man has 
regained his balance, and no matter 
what conditions he may be called up­
on to meet later on in his school 
career, he has learned from his first 
year’s experience to keep himself al­
ways under control.
FINAL EXAMINATIONS.
The first half of the year is nearly 
over. The final examinations are only 
three weeks off. By this time almost 
all the work in your courses has been 
completed, and if you have done all 
of your work faithfully, there is little 
to worry about in the examinations. 
Students who have been through them 
do not need to be told that “cramming” 
the last week does not supply all the 
deficiencies in their learning. There 
are some subjects that have given you 
the most trouble and these are the ones 
that you are bothered about. You will 
give most of your time to these and if 
you have the right spirit, you will 
make good in them. No matter how 
poorly you have been doing, now is the 
time to brace up and show that you 
are worthy of advancement. Remem­
ber that it is much easier to do your 
“plugging” for the first examinations, 
than it is for a “re” some months after 
you have left the subject.
The Plebes, especially are warned 
that insufficient preparation will re­
sult in conditions, and enough condi­
tions will result in another repeater, 
or one more to fall by the wayside.
If you succeed, do not take all the 
credit, but thank the instructors who 
have worked with you during the term. 
If failure should be your fate, do not 
blame anyone but yourself. Failure 
here does not mean that your life is 
a failure, but that you are given a 
chance to do something for which you 
are more fitted.
“Honor thy father and thy mother” 
—and thyself. Don’t disgrace your 
father, your mother and yourself by 
taking credit for that which is not 
yours.
“If you must fail, then fail. Don’t 
be a cheat.”
W. H. Searight.
For the first time the Warren Prize 
has ever gone outside of New York, 
a Carnegie man carried it out. T. D. 
Fitzgibbon, Senior, was the lucky man 
and certainly deserves credit for the 
honor he has brought the school.
The inlaying and wood carving in 
the new Design School Theatre is 
rapidly being put in place and the dec­
orators assure us that the theatre will 
be ready for the dedication on Found­
er’s Day.
Paul Frati, the Master Modeler, who 
has executed all the decoration in the 
new Design School, leaves for New 
York on Saturday. He has been with 
us for eight months and we will miss 
his smiling face.

THE ART OF SIGN WRITING.
Sign writing and sign painting, like 
many another art and craft, has gone 
through a series of marked evolutions. 
The art, as we know it, bears little 
resemblance to that practiced in by­
gone days.
It is a very ancient craft, but little 
of its romantic and picturesque senti­
ment remains to attract and please us 
today, in this country, at all events. 
In Europe, we find echoes of the 
past in the escutcheons of noble fam­
ilies recalling the age of chivalry and 
knighthood, of those great religious 
movements, the Crusades, when 
around the banners or signs of their 
chiefs gathered their followers.
Again, where do we find, as in days 
of old, those quaint, telling, signs of 
the inns, the various city guilds and 
crafts? They have passed, for the 
most part obliterated by the change 
in social conditions and the on-rush of 
a relentless commercialism.
From the broad, simple statement 
of a fact the art has developed into a 
labyrinth of innumerable ramifications, 
requiring on the part of the up-to-date 
sign writer a knowledge far deeper 
than his brother craftsman of yore 
ever possessed. Yet, with all his 
learning, his productions lack that 
spontaneous, artistic quality that the 
work of the ancient men nearly al­
ways showed.
This is essentially a specializing age 
•—an age of compelling concentration.
In former times it was sufficient for 
a tradesman or merchant to inform the 
public of his business by a special 
sign painted upon a board, or cut out 
in a certain shape, in order to obtain 
results. What do we see today? Not 
only this general announcement 
worked out in electric bulbs, but each 
article contained within the show win­
dow is more often than not, adorned 
with an individual card, setting forth 
the style, quality and price of it. In 
other words, it is the merchant’s lens 
by which he endeavors to focus the 
attention of a vacillating public.
Now, of course, this method of do­
ing business has created an immense 
field for the sign and show card writ­
er, and there are today hundreds of 
men engaged solely in the production 
of such work. But what of the quality 
of their work? It is good, bad, or 
indifferent? Taking it as a whole, I do 
not think that it can be classified as 
other than mediocre. Much of it is 
bad. It is very rarely that one sees 
good lettering, good spacing or good 
ornamentation. For the most part, 
the quality of the show cards 
has not kept pace with the won­
derful advancement made in window 
displays. Quite frequently one sees a 
really excellent window treatment mar­
red by very inferior cards—perhaps 
the lettering is passable, but the ar­
rangement of it is altogether bad, oc­
cupying the whole field without a mar­
gin and utterly devoid of any evidence 
of thought as to the spacing. In short, 
the standard of work is poor. The re­
sponsibility for this state of things 
rests not wholly upon those who pro­
duce it, but, in a great measure, it must
be placed upon the merchants who 
force their ideas upon the impecunious 
sign-writer, considering only the com­
mercial side of the question; the bare 
statement of a fact being deemed suf­
ficient, no matter how crudely it is 
presented to the public. The solving 
of the problem resolves itself, there­
fore, into a matter of education, re­
quiring a better understanding of those 
principles of artistic arrangement 
which it has been proved by long ex­
perience are pleasing and attractive 
to the eye.
This not only necessitates a more 
intelligent appreciation of these laws, 
but an unreserved and broadly based 
co-operation on the part of all con­
cerned, in order to make a lasting and 
a general improvement in this line of 
work.
It devolves upon you students your­
selves, to make a start toward the up­
lift of your art, to endow it with that 
dignity that compels respectful atten­
tion.
Raise the quality of your work, and 
you will get better results and more 
of it to do. You can only do this by 
acquiring knowledge, which is power, 
and applying it in a straightforward, 
commonsense way,

Why, going to the Prom.
BAND NOTICE.
In a short time the baseball season 
will be upon us, and we are anxious 
to have a good band organization to 
encourage the baseball boys in their 
efforts. We intend to have a new di­
rector for the Band in a short time, 
and anyone coming out will gain not 
only enjoyment but profitable musi­
cal instruction as well.
The management has good reasons 
to think that if a good showing is 
made by the band, uniforms will be 
purchased for the use of men taking 
an active part in rehearsals and con­
certs. About two years ago some 
money was promised by friends of the 
institution for band uniforms. While 
the greater part of this money has not 
been collected, it is believed that some­
thing can be done towards getting at 
least part of the remaining promises 
fulfilled this spring. We feel reason­
ably sure that the remaining sum nec­
essary for the purchase of uniforms 
will be furnished by the Student Ac­
tivities Fund.
It is needless to quote the value of 
a good band in advertising the schools 
and in the furtherance of school spirit. 
A good band will surely result if every 
man playing a band instrument turns 
out with it. We hope and expect this 
will happen when notices of rehearsals 
next appear in the columns of The 
Tartan and elsewhere.

A year with its sunshine, its sorrow; 
its balmiest and fiercest seasons, and 
its flowers, green grass, frost-black­
ened stalks and multi-colored leaves 
was depicted in a finished manner, 
Tuesday evening, January sixth, in the 
gymnasium of the Margaret Morrison 
School by the members of the Dra­
matic Club, when they gave Christina 
Rossetti’s “Pageant of the Months.” 
Miss Anna Thomas appeared first to 
give the keynote to the play. She de­
scribed the twelve months that fol­
lowed. At the conclusion of her mon­
ologue, January, garbed in clothes sig­
nifying the season and seated before a 
hearth full of fading embers, an­
nounced the birth of a new year.
In the proper successions the re­
maining months appeared just in time 
to bid adieu to the preceding month 
and to instill a new spirit into the 
world. The young women wore long, 
flowing costumes, the color and de­
signs of which pictured in a charming 
fashion the months of the 3rear. The 
lines of the play were sweet or harsh 
according with the month they de­
scribed.
Probably the most striking touches 
of color in the pageant were given 
when August, typified by Miss Doro­
thy Skinner, entered with her arms 
burdened with bundles of the various 
kinds of ripened grains and later was 
greeted by September, represented by 
Miss Mary Wentzel, who carried a tray 
ladened with the fruits of the season. 
She was deeply sorrowful because the 
harsh winds were supplanting the soft 
gentle summer breezes, and the frosts 
were blotting out the green shades in 
the leaves and substituting for them 
scores of colors, foreign to mid-sum­
mer. When she was sorely touched, 
October, Miss Helen Harbison, be­
decked in leaves and carrying a pot 
of nuts, swept in and brightened the 
situation with the glowing lines of op­
timism which prevails during the har­
vest season.
The Boar’s Head Procession, at the 
close of the pageant, was one of the 
chief features of the entertainment. 
Members of the organization led a 
march across the stage, around 
through the audience and back to the 
platform. The girls sang their Alma 
Mater song, during the entire pro­
cession. Ruth Welty, dressed as a 
Tartan Maid, led the procession. She 
was followed by the pages. Miss Flor­
ence Lytle, dressed as the cook, and 
Miss Katherine Sawyer, as Saint Nich­
olas, preceded Miss Ann Freeman, and 
Miss Helen Logan as the lord and 
lady. Then came the pageant and the 
members of the Glee Club.
Mrs. Vermorcken was chairman of 
the committee in charge of the enter­
tainment. Miss Patton directed the
staging, and Miss Ernst had charge 
of the costumes. Miss Demorest 
trained the members of the cast and 
Miss Stoner directed the dancing. She 
composed several new dances for the 
pageant. Members of the Glee Club 
sang “Silent Night,” “The First Now­
ell,” and “The Birthday of the King.”
INSTRUCTION IN DRAMATIC 
SCHOOL TO BEGIN SOON.
Donald Robertson, the first instruc­
tor in the Dramatic School, will ar­
rive the first of February to take 
charge of the technical work (acting 
and rehearsal). Mr. Robertson is one 
of the most vividly known actors of 
America and will be here only six 
weeks. The instructors in this course 
will be partly of the visiting type. 
Several other prominent actors are on 
the schedule and will be announced 
later.
The first play w’ill be produced on 
April 23rd. In all probability it will 
be Shakespearean in type.
DELTA SKULL DANCE.
The annual dinner dance of Delta 
Skull was held at the Hotel Schenley 
on Friday evening, January 9. Dinner 
was served at seven o’clock, and the 
dancing followed at nine o’clock.
Are you a “piker”? No! Then come 
to the Prom-.
THE ALVIN.
Edward Sheldons latest play “Ro­
mance,” comes to the Alvin Monday, 
January 19, following its present re­
markable run at the Princess Thea­
tre, Chicago. “Romance” takes its 
audiences back to the quaint old New 
York of fifty years ago, its fashions, 
sentiments and manners. It tells the 
curious love story of a young clergy­
man and a grand opera singer. Mad­
ame Margerita Cavallini is a dazzling 
diva of the opera, a grande artiste, 
whom all the gilded youth of the day 
adore; yet in the end she loses her 
heart, most curiously, to the young 
rector of St. Giles. And it is this 
young rector, now a gray-haired bish­
op, who tells the story to his own 
nephew, who is in love with an actress.
What have you got that dress suit 
for if it is not to wear to the Prom?
DUQUESNE.
“The Girl Question.”
Another musical comedy is sched­
uled for the week of January 19 at the 
Duquesne, when the Harry Davis 
Players, with a big chorus and an 
augmented cast and orchestra, will 
give a gorgeous presentation of “The 
Girl Question,” which ran for more 
than a year at the LaSalle Opera 
House, Chicago, and subsequently cre­
ated a furore en tour. The book and 
lyrics are extremely witty, and the 
musical numbers are exquisite and 
catchy.

---------------------------------------------------

the discrepancy between the professor 
who “grades high” and the one who 
“grades low”; the former is prevented 
from giving more than a certain num­
ber of high marks, and the latter is 
forced to give them. There is a gen­
eral leveling up of standards in dif­
ferent departments and among the 
faculty generally. “Snap” courses tend 
to disappear, or at any rate cease to 
be popular with the students who like 
to bring up their average with a small 
effort, for one can no longer be sure 
of getting one of the few high marks 
allowed. And, in the long run, we 
may assume that there is good aca­
demic reason behind this leveling; 
for the teacher who "grades high” is 
apt to be lax in his standard of work, 
whereas the one who “grades low” has 
often failed to teach well enough to 
enable his students to pass his own 
tests, or perhaps is a poor judge of 
what degree of difficulty his students 
will find in a paper. And though no 
mere system of grading will do away 
with poor teaching, this system does 
avoid some of the injustice and in­
equality that results from poor teach­
ing. A man who had been obliged to 
pass students who made only forty 
per cent with him, or a man who 
found that he had to fail students who 
made ninety per cent on the old sys­
tem, would see the necessity of chang­
ing his own methods and standards 
and thus would bring up the average 
excellence of teaching.
The mechanical application of this 
system is successful, of course, only 
in large classes, for in smaller class­
es and in really advanced work it has 
to be used pretty flexibly. It would 
be absurd to give the theoretical num­
ber of I’s and F’s to a class of four 
or five seniors who have elected the 
course because of their special fitness. 
Yet the grades given by any individual 
instructor during a year or several 
years ought to average 25 per cent 
I’s and F’s, SO per cent M’s, and 25 
per cent S’s and E’s. The ordinary 
curve of probability, used by satis- 
ticians generally, shows that this is 
the distribution to be expected in or­
dinary educational work, and for col­
lege work proper experience bears out 
theory. In professional schools the 
tendency would be toward a larger 
percentage of low grades, for there 
one is dealing not with the average 
human factor, but with special apti­
tudes. The space at my command 
does not allow a discussion of this 
problem, but anyone interested in the 
mathematical probabilities can see the 
bearing of this element of choice of 
vocation on the probability curve.
The most interesting feature of the 
system as I have known it in practice 
was the method of compelling the fac­
ulty to observe its rules. This method 
was the perfectly simple one of mak­
ing public among the faculty the aver­
age of all the grades given by each 
members. The faculty members 
were then rated in a list with the 
top name that of the teacher giving 
the highest grades and so on down to 
the one giving the lowest. Every­
body knew where everybody else

A RELATIVE SYSTEM OF 
CRADING.
There are probably but few students 
who in the course of their studies do 
not feel occasionally that some grade 
or lating they have received is un­
just. Indeed, there are few teachers 
who have not felt occasionally great 
doubt whether their grades were giv­
en justly. This uncertainty is due in 
part to the unsatisfactory nature of 
tests, to indefinite notions about the 
proportionate value of recitations, 
note-books, and examinations in mak­
ing up a semester average, and to 
various other causes; it is also partly 
due to an inevitable personal equation 
which no instructor can ever wholly 
avoid; and it is due no less to an in­
herent perverseness of the percentage 
system. It has occurred to me that 
readers of the Tartan might be inter­
ested in a relative system of grading 
which is in use at one of the large 
State universities, where I became 
familiar with it, and which success­
fully avoids some of the disadvantages 
of the usual system as I have just indi­
cated them.
This system sweeps away first the 
whole percentage idea, and allows of 
no “passing mark” at all. The instruc­
tor, in grading a class, may use any 
numerical marks that he pleases for 
his own private guidance, but his final 
task is simply to arrange the names in 
the order of relative excellence, put­
ting as number 1 on the list the stu­
dent who has done the best work in 
the class, number 2 on the list the 
student who has done second best, and 
so on. After this the assignment of 
grades is mechanical. One-half the 
class is called “Medium,” and given 
the grade of M; these are of course 
the middle names on the list; in a 
class of one hundred they would be 
numbers 26 to 75. The grade M is 
thus a clear pass on the work done. 
The names in the lower fourth of the 
list are given grades that are not 
equivalent to a clear pass. The major­
ity of them are given what amounts to 
a condition, called “Inferior,” or I, and 
the worst of all are given “Failure,” 
or F. The other fourth of the class, 
those above. M on the list, are given 
“Superior,” or S, and “Excellent,” or 
E, the latter grade being given to the 
few at the very top.
A little consideration will show that 
this method dififers radically from the 
usual percentage system; for suppose 
that the teacher makes out two sets 
of grades for each class, one set on the 
basis of an absolute passing percent, 
and the other on the relative basis that 
I have just described,—in one class the 
lowest M will have, say, on the abso­
lute scale a grade of 60 per cent, while 
in another class the lowest M will 
have, say, 70 per cent. In other words, 
one class “passes” at 10 per cent low­
er than the other. And it is at once 
evident that this system' does away 
with what is perhaps the greatest 
grievance of the old system,—that is,

stood. And considerable discredit at­
tached to the high and low positions 
on such a list, so that gradually the 
extreme positions came in nearer and 
nearer the norm. P'or, too low grades 
no longer meant that one instructor 
was so much more “exacting” or 
“strict” than another, and too high 
grades no longer meant anything at 
all. High and low meant merely that 
the grades were being given accord­
ing to individual caprice.
This system is open to many objec­
tions, of course, but it is by far the 
most satisfactory plan that I have 
ever used in a long experience of 
teaching under many systems; and to 
the student it assures at least consist­
ent treatment—is there any student 
who would deny that “consistency is 
a jewel?”

leadership. Colleges should train men 
to be such leaders. We have an ex­

School.
5. Address, Dr. J. Naismith, “Bas­
ketball.”
“Basketball was produced in an in­
ternational institute. The first rules 
were published in ‘The Triangle’ of 
the Springfield Training School.
“The game was not evolved, but cre­
ated upon present-day basis of sport. 
The game demands the highest type 
of the physically trained, who should 
be tall, slender and agile with ability 
to reach and jump quickly and easily. 
La Crosse was the ideal game.
“Basketball is easily taken up, re­
quires little apparatus, was first 
played with an association football, 
and can be played on any gym floor. 
The first game was played on a court 
35 x 45 with nine men on each side.
“In order to keep up the interest 
of the spectators, it was made a team 
game. It met requirements that the 
other games could not furnish. To 
avoid tackling, running with the ball 
was eliminated. To eliminate the 
roughness of hockey, and of throwing 
the goal was made horizontal and ele­
vated. In the first game, a couple of 
peach baskets, that just happened to 
be in the building, were used. Hence 
the name of the game.
“To eliminate the roughness due to 
scrimmage, the rule to throw the ball 
up for two men was made.
“There are two general sets of rules 
for the amateur game, the A. A. U. and 
the Intercollegiate. In the former a 
goal cannot be made following a drib­
ble.
“The professional game is made fast 
for the spectators’ benefit. It is 
played in a cage so as to eliminate 
‘out of bounds.’
“The game was slightly altered for 
girls. Whoever gets the ball in both 
hands has three seconds to get rid 
of it. In the West, the court is di­
vided into three parts, through a mis­
take in interpreting the rules.
“The game was made international 
by being a Y. M. C. A. sport. The first 
diagram was drawn by a Jap. The 
game was used in the Elmira Reforma­
tory as an exercise and in the Indian 
School to promote personal control.
“Cornell was the first college to take 
up the game as a sport, but, as they 
played a whole class on a side, it was 
found to be too rough. Yale was the 
first to use it as a game. Now, a 
large number of colleges, high schools, 
ships, forts, cities in the Canal Zone, 
Sunday Schools, playground associa­
tions and Y. M. C. A.’s have teams.
“Basketball is individualistic, cheap 
and requires only a few men. It is a 
game which shows skill and develops 
ability rather than scores or marks.
“La crosse and English football are 
co-operative and require individual 
brains; baseball and American football 
are machine-like and make each player 
a cog in the team. Basketball is a 
combination of both.”
6. The National Collegiate Associa­
tion is connected with the American 
Soccer Association to the extent of 
sending Dr. Babbitt as a representa­
tive to their meetings.

7. Report of Committee on Creden­
tials.
8. Report of the Secretary-Treas- 
urer.
9. Reports from districts.
F'irst District, C. E. Bolster, of 
Dartmouth. “The tendencies are to 
win games only. I would suggest 
a short pre-season football practice, 
which, however, is impossible in base­
ball.
There is a movement in the district 
to stop cheers at baseball games. One 
college tried the scheme of having 
only the catcher talk during the game, 
but his remarks were confined to two 
expressions which became tiresome 
and were jeered at. Another school 
agreed to do away with talking on the 
field entirely.
“It is suggested that the coach be 
not allowed on the baseball field, 
claiming him to be a professional, and 
the tenth man on the team'.
“The numbering of the football and 
baseball players is suggested for the 
benefit of the public who support the 
games.
“More field space and an increased 
popularity in minor sports has devel­
oped in this district.”
Second District, W. L. Wilson of Lo- 
high. (Our district.)
“Lacrosse is being introduced. Soc­
cer has taken a big stand, and is 
gaining in popularity rapidly in this 
district.”
Third District, R. T. Abercrombie 
of Johns Hopkins.
Fourth District, Walter Hullihen of 
University of the South.
“Enthusiasm in basketball and track 
is just starting.
“A large effort is common in trying 
to evade all amateur laws. Profes­
sionalism is looked upon as in the same 
class with class cuts, chapel cuts, etc. 
—all right if it can be ‘got away with.’ ”
Fifth District, James Paige of Min­
nesota.
“The district is introducing radical 
rules regarding coaches. In baseball, 
the coach must sit in the grandstand. 
Football coaches must come from the 
alumni.”
Sixth District, W. G. Manly of Mis­
souri.
“The control of athletics is strictly 
in the hands of the faculty, not only 
in regard to eligibility rules, but also 
in regard to the finances.
“Most of the colleges in this district 
do not play freshmen, some barring 
them for the first semester.”
Seventh District, Hugo Bezdek of 
Arkansas.
Eighth District, O. C. Lester of Col­
orado.
“Football is prohibited to a large 
extent. Changes in the rules are sug­
gested.
“Soccer is being taken up.
“The hammer throw is being elim­
inated from track meets.”
10. Reports of Standing Commit­
tees.
A committee on rules to govern 
swimming meets was created.
A motion to send a message to un­
degraduate students to be published 
in their school papers was passed.
A motion to hold the next conven­
tion in Chicago was passed.
1. Football Rules Committee, H. L. 
Williams of Minnesota.
Suggested the retention of the for­
ward pass.
A kick may be made from any place 
back of the line instead of five yards 
back.
A rule in regard to players returning 
to the game.
A suggested change in the quarter­
back rules.
The committee will meet soon with 
the old Rules Committee to make reg­
ulations for this year.
2. Football Fatalities, G. W. Ehler.
Reports of four deaths for the 1913
season have been received, but only 
one of these can be really charged up 
to the season.
A man was tackled near the side­
line and, while throwing himself for­
ward to make a slight gain, was tack­
led from behind, doubling him up and 
breaking his spinal column between 
the fifth and sixth vertebrae.
A man was injured slightly, but 
stood on the sidelines watching the re­
mainder of the game. He caught a 
cold which developed into pneumonia.
A player had a leg broken, and 
blood-poisoning necessitated amputa­
tion. Pneumonia followed and caused 
the man’s death.
A discredited newspaper story has 
it that the fourth man died from men­
ingitis due to an injury received in 
1910.
3. Central Board on Officials, J. A. 
Babbitt.
4. Basketball Rules Committee, J. 
E. Raycroft.
“No important changes in the rules.”

6. Committee on Association Foot­
ball, J. A. Babbitt.
A rules book has been published.
Men are being put into localities 
where the game is wanted to teach the 
game.
Columbia has the lead in soccer. 
There are over one hundred teams in 
Philadelphia.
The principal soccer football cen­
ters are New Yorky Brooklyn, Boston, 
Philadelphia, Pittsburgh and a few 
others.
Mr. Mapes of Columbia said that the 
Blue and White was pushing the game 
to its utmost and had, this year, for 
the first time, hired a professional 
coach. The game is growing every 
day.
11. Reports of Special Committees.
1. on the Encouragement of Recre­
ative Intracollegiate sports, H. S. 
Wingert.
The present methods of athletics do 
not reach the mass of the students.
An average of $59.50 per man is 
spent in inter-collegiate sports, while 
an average of $1.56 per man is spent 
in intra-collegiate sports.
Only 16t/2 per cent of the average 
student body engage in the former, 
while 4034 per cent engage in the lat­
ter.
The following suggestions were 
made:
“This association should endeavor 
to convince college authorities of the 
imperative need of instruction and su­
pervision in recreative sport and hy­
giene and rational exercise.”
“The work should be placed in the 
charge of a capable and enthusiastic 
director to have general supervision 
over the plans and details of the or­
ganization.
“Adequate facilities should be placed 
at the disposal of the director.
“Intra-collegiate sport and recrea­
tion should be planned with the con­
stant purpose in view of usefulness in 
after life.
"A systematic course in personal 
hygiene during the early part and a 
training in the habit of physical recre­
ation during the larger part of the 
student’s college life should be given 
and required of all students.
“The committee suggests the giving 
of academic credit for a limited amount 
of elective work in intra-collegiate 
sports and hygiene.”
2. On Ridding College Baseball of 
its Objectionable Features, Dean L. 
Bevier, Jr.
Advises against trickery.
Advises a strict enforcement of the 
coaching rules, which are:
(a) The coacher shall be restricted 
to coaching the base-runner only, and 
shall not, by words or signs, try to 
incite the spectators to demonstra­
tion. He shall not use words that will 
reflect upon a player, the umpire or a 
spectator.
(b) The umpire shall not permit 
anyone but the players, substitute in 
uniform, and the manager of the team
to sit on the bench.
(c) The blocking of a runner, or 
the prying of a runner off base, is for­
bidden.
The above rules are already in exist­
ence.
The following rules were also sub­
mitted and passed, with regard to col­
lege baseball:
(a) That the catcher shall not, dur­
ing actual play, speak at all to the bats­
man, except where occasion requires a 
bona fide word of caution, and, in 
speaking to the pitcher, he shall not 
use words reflecting or calculated to 
reflect upon the batsman or upon any 
member of the opposing team.
(b) No member of either team shall 
call or shout during the game to any 
member of the opposing team except 
to caution him against some danger, 
nor behave in any indecorous or un­
seemly manner.
(c) There shall be no oral coaching 
from the bench.
(d) The so-called “encouragement” 
of the pitcher from the outfield shall 
be stopped, or, at least, minimized.
The enforcement of the second pre­
existing rule means the placing of the 
professional coach among the spec^ 
tators instead of on the bench and 
leaves the game strictly to a team of 
amateurs.
The committee suggests courtesy to 
the visiting team by both spectators 
and players, even to the extent of ap­
plauding where occasion suggests it.

EVENING SESSION.
The evening session consisted of a 
general discussion on the topic of 
“Summer Baseball.”
After the discussion was over, a 
resolution was passed prohibiting col­
leges from allowing men who had been 
remunerated for playing any game 
from1 competing in any intercollegiate 
game.
Mr. E. H. Nichols of Harvard said 
that a student who is a good player 
should be discouraged from the idea 
of taking a contract from an organized 
ball team, because it deadens his love 
for the game and kills the spirit of fair 
play. He said that the student who 
plays for money should not be allowed 
to represent his institution. He de­
plored the fact that some colleges go 
after the skilled players.
Dr. C. Young, of Cornell, advocated 
the above resolution that was adopted.
It was suggested that an amateur 
team composed of college players 
from different schools with a college 
manager be gotten up for the summer 
months.
Ray Fisher, of the New York Amer­
icans and of Middleburg College, 
spoke in favor of the college man 
who played ball during the summer 
months to help pay his way through 
school.

Dr. George Hough, of Maine, also

matter has been fought against for

complished.

ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE NEW 
DEPARTMENT OF DRAMA.
The School of Applied De­
sign announces the opening of a De­
partment of Drama beginning Febru­
ary 9, 1914. A limited number of 
students will be enrolled, and a course 
adapted for first year students only 
will be offered for the second semes­
ter of the current college year, which 
extends from February 9th to June 
17th. For the present no night courses 
are to be offered in this department.
The work of the Department of 
Drama, open to both men and women, 
is planned to give the student a gen­
eral knowledge of the technic of the 
drama, approaching it by literary and 
historical courses as well as through 
a severe training in direct technical 
work. The intention is to provide a 
full knowledge rather than a highly 
specialized practice.
The credits in direct technical work 
are to be given on the Beaux Arts 
method of mentions for accomplish­
ment, not on the number of hours 
spent in rehearsal. The work in the 
fourth year of the course allows the 
student to specialize in acting, in stage 
decoration and scene design, in dra­
matic literature, composition or criti­
cism, in costume, or in the general 
work of production; but these op­
tional courses must be founded on ex­
cellence in the previous study. For 
the present, only students in the first 
and second years will be admitted.
The equipment of the department 
includes a practical theater, seating 
four hundred and fifty, with complete 
stage appliances.
The course leads to a degree of 
Bachelor of Arts in Drama, to be 
granted only to students earning the
credits listed below. As the course 
progresses, a limited number of stu­
dents on unusual proficiency may be 
admitted to advanced standing.

MUSICAL CLUBS AT UNIVER­
SITY CLUB.
Last Saturday night at 8:45 P. M. 
the combined clubs met at the Uni­
versity Club on Grant boulevard and 
entertained over a hundred of its mem­
bers with the finest kind of college 
glee and instrumental music. The con­
cert throughout was the best the club 
has given this year, and it sparkled 
with a vim that would put White Rock 
in the shade. Both clubs acquitted 
themselves creditably and performed 
in perfect unison and rythym.
The clubs have improved wonder­
fully since the last concert and the 
work Saturday night was an exempli­
fication of what good hard work on 
music means. It can be seen that our 
“Annual Home Concert” will surpass 
all previous attempts if this improve­
ment is kept up.
After the concert, a short speller 
was given that rocked the buildings 
and the vibration was in unison with 
the steady tramp of the men up stairs 
to the banquet hall on the second 
floor. Here was found one long table 
with two round tables at the ends, 
daintily decorated. It was a beauti­
ful sight when fifty young college men, 
full of vigor, in formal dress, sat down 
to enjoy one of the finest menus ever 
placed before a gathering in that fam­
ous club. One table at the end was 
reserved for the officers of the clubs 
and the invited guests, who were Dean 
Henry Hornbostel, Mr. Gordon and 
Mr. McClung.
As the noise subsided following Bill 
Galord’s rendition of “Fol-der-rol” 
President Madison announced the 
speaker of the evening, Dean Horn­
bostel, of the Design School. As is 
usual, the Dean gave the boys some­
thing to remember as he went over in 
detail the building up of Tech, since 
he has seen it as no one else has. His 
reminiscences covered the organizing 
of each of the four schools. He has 
seen the “greatest school of its kind 
in the world” built from its infancy. 
The Dean said “I, tonight, have just 
completed a five days’ trip from San 
Francisco and, boys, when I stepped 
inside this building, I was completely 
entranced by your music—you play 
and sing wonderfully. It’s a marvel to 
see that you all represent that great 
school in Schenley Park. Organized 
music is the finest of culture, boys,
and I want to say that when you’ve 
hypnotized three old vets like Gordon, 
McClung, and myself with your music 
you’ve got it on Victor Herbert and 
Paderewski.”
Mr. McClung was the next speaker 
and he responded with a few hearty 
greetings from the University Club.
Mr. Gordon said a few words of praise 
for the clubs and wished them the best 
of success, stating that he hoped the 
annual concert at Uniersity Club 
would be a permanent thing.
Mr. Scalzo gave a very nice talk in 
his usual pleasant way, incidentally 
stating that the Mandolin Club could 
be brushed here and there in order to 
attain that perfection which shows the 
effect of careful training and conscien­
tious study.
Mr. McDowell told how he had fol­
lowed Glee Clubs from the time “he 
kicked a slat from the. back of his 
first cradle” and that the success of 
each club depended upon the iniative 
of its members and their ability to de­
velop new ideas.
Friday night, January 16, the clubs 
will go to the First Presbyterian 
Church, Homestead, for a concert at 
8:00 P. M. sharp. There will be a 
reception by the young ladies of the 
church afterward, so there’s going to 
be a good time.
WIRELESS CLUB BECOMES 
RADIO CLUB.
At the regular bi-weekly meeting 
of the Wireless Club, held on January 
8, 1914, the name of the club was offi­
cially changed from the Wireless Club 
to the Radio Club. The work on the 
new high power sending set was di­
vided among members of the club. 
More interest was shown in the doings 
of the club than has been shown at 
any meeting this semester. The next 
meeting will be held at five o’clock on 
Thursday, January 22, 1914, in room 
209 Science.
When the core arrived for the new 
transformer it was found to be large 
enough for a 5 KW. instead of a 3. 
This change was a welcome one for 
the members because they are striv­
ing for recognition among the other 
schools who have high power stations. 
Arrangements have almost been com­
pleted for a room in Machinery Hall 
and before long the crack of dots and 
dashes will be flashing broadcast over 
the country from C. I. T.
THE JUNIOR PROM.
The Junior Prom Committee has 
been working hard during the vaca­
tion period and have almost all the 
arrangements completed.
The committee expects this to be, 
with the help of the upper classes and 
the alumni, the most successful Prom 
that has been held.
The date has been set as Friday 
night, February 20th, and the place 
secured is the Rittenhouse.
The committee has been extremely 
fortunate in securing Nirella to furn­
ish the music and he has promised us 
his best men.
We recommend the merchants advertising in the Tartan as the best in town. They will give you the best prices and quality.
