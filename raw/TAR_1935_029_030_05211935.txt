Miss Edith Winchester, Head of Depcrtment of

Miss Edith 'Winchester, h6ad of the Department of Secre­tarial Studies, is one woman in the world who- does not enter­tain the fond ¦wish that she were eighteen-years old again.* What’s move, she actually .likes the age she “owns” now better than'she did at eighteen.; Even better, she thinks she sees the humor in things now more than she did at eighteen. On the whole we can surmise Miss Wln<“ cliester would not care to he eight­een again.

Subsidize the ThistleI
N A SHORT two weeks the Carnegie This­
tle for. 1935 will make its appearance. Al: 
ready the staff officers for tlie 1936 year book 
V have been approved by Student council.
• ;Each year the members of the junior class 
...who assume the responsibility for producing 
. a year book, which will reflect creditably-4ipon 
i.V.thftjEnrollment and prestige of Carnegie, have 
: one' mountain-sized obstacle to contend '
: How is the Thistle to be financed?"
"-‘‘We propose that the school subsidize the 
^¦publication of the Thialïù. This propositi; 
rió new .one. Previous proposals have ; 
-reased as far os the Executive Board, bu 
: definite action has been forthcoming,
.V. À guaranteed budget, is a necessity ii 
'expect to have avcompletely successful year 
•book. A*, the present time the income.upon 
. " which the Thistle budget is baaed depends 
almost entirely upon advertising receipts, In- 
. /come from sales, and an appropriation from 
-the .Student council. An unvarying budget Is 
impossible when the lucome is controlled by 
’factors which cannot be fixed.
' ; If the Thistle staff could be assured of 
; fixed income they could produce the very best 
;‘book possible with funds which they could de' 
.pend upon.
. We offer two plans which would guarantee, 
•• •a steady Income for the Thistle. First, we 
.'would suggest a redistribution of the fifteen 
• dollar activities tee: Under present condi-
' lions one organization Is receiving more than 
'two-thirds of the amount! If just one dollar 
coùld be aet aside as a year book fund the 
,"*$2,000 raised In this manner, plus Income from 
.'sales to lower classmen, and advertising Un- 
tóme, would make the Thistle a financial;f,Nu
- i^Another scheme would be..to ns.sepà fach_in­
coming freshman a graduation fee.' At. the 
^present time this charge ismade. during the 
. 'senior year. Experience has /shown that a 
-^'goodly number of entering freshmen never 
? .graduate. Now< if this goodlr number who fall 
j^bythe weyslde had already paid a gradu**-' — 
r- : • fiaé, this money could be .set aside- and a This- 
J tlé fund gradually built up.
Both oí these plans have possibililiei 
: we. pledge our support to any plan which 
would guarantee-a fixed income to the Car- 
ilegie year book.

at the'things she smiles at! They aren’t 
funny. Slapstick. Nothing but low com­

like that.
But as I was Baying, while I don’t want to pretend I’m superior, slapstick' stuff just leaves me cold. 1 like things that are subtle. In the newspapers I see things that most people don’t even understand. Last night I almost laughed myself into a coma—but did others laugh at the same piece of information? No. 1 read at least

I guess I'm just lucky, being able to do both. For Instance, take what I said this after*-, noon duriug the news reel. They-were showing that Italian with the bald head and—just llko that—I thought of the fun­niest-thing. I said, “Mouselini’s a. big cheese!” You see? Mussolini—Mouselinl —mouse—cheese. Do you get it? .Well,. Bome Italian woman In back of me didn’t get it. She wanted to hit me over. the - head with her umbrella. . But just the same, lots of other people thought I was witty. If they didn’t, why did they laugh wh§n I ,crawled out from under the seat?
Of course. I’m used to people who think I’m clever—Mrs. Pendleton, for instance. The other night at her dinner party I pulled the funniest joke.: of my life: Even Airs. Pendleton, who knows me, was- as­tonished. The dinner party was at a: very uppish hotel. Well, 1 simply, couldn’t stand one of‘the waiters. He was looking down his nose at me as much as to say, “What .do I care if you don't like my serv­ice? I’ll get a tip-anyway.’' He knew lhat Mr. Pendleton tips like a perfect fool. Finally I dcclded to. show that waiter his place. But rather than make a row—I simply can’t stand , rows—I decided to be

(noueii lo tell us that the plumni golf team, is more than ready for the 
varsity. At present the alumni are trying .to find a diploma for Tom 
Davies, freshman football coach and an ace golfer In his Blu right.
The match will probably be played at-the Field Club. Those arriv­
ing late for the first round can probably get all the details in the replay 
at the Club bar in the evening. Last year the alumni took the second 
bair with ease ana ale.
AS GUY HALFERTY PREDICTED, his tracksters took it easy to win 
over Allegheny even though some of his stars were missing. The 
boys seemed to be relaxing and had things pretty much their own 
way. The one the thlnlyclads (apologies to- Jerry Hanson) have to' 
worry about now Is the Geneva meet which threatens to break their 
winning streak. At any rate It should be a peach of a meet.
Some of the lads are suggesting'that Milt Dinger, the .Mad Monki 
of the Field House, should make some arrangement to tie or straight- 
jacket Coach Guy who does a lot more work sprinting about the Bowl 
thany any of the boys on the squad.
KED STEWART, THE MAN WHO COPIES AND GOES, dropped in at 
the Field House a while ago antf there ran into Harpster who had tils 
ios with him. After the usual repartee the red bead Inquired:
“What’s the dog good for?”
“I’m teaching him to do tricks," stooged Harp.
"Huh, I thought you had to know more than the dog to do that,’1 
sniffed Stewart. Belly-laffs from the boys in the back room as Red

STROLLING INTO THE SERGEANT'S HEADQUARTERS THE other 
day we heard that the sophomores had shot the plebes In a match 
awhile ago. Maintaining our aplomb we asked If they,shot all of them 
or just the more offensive ones. The Sarge looked disgusted and ex­
plained it was only a match and that the boys are quite good frlend6—

lieve that this Council, despite the

The rapid ¦progress made during the few yeare . ' of its existence should be continued in the fulure. The meetings should be more than “mere 'formalities’' If we are to achieve greater success.'

The thoroughness with;which duties have been'exe-. icuted in the post, substantiate-the , efficiency and soundness of its con­ception.
