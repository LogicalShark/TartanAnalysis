Cyert meets Israeli leaders
by Elliot Ohlberg
President Richard Cyert and three mem­
bers of the CMU Board of Trustees were 
among a small contingent of business and 
educational leaders of Pittsburgh who re­
cently returned from seven days in Israel.
The trip was co-sponsored by the Na­
tional Jewish Foundation (NJF) and the
* Israeli government. Israel covered all 
expenses except transportation, which the 
NJF paid for. Lester Hamburg, L. Stanton 
Williams, and Jim Lee were the Trustees 
present. Mr. Hamburg also helped organize 
the trip.
The group met with Israeli government
Variances hurt 
planned dorm.
by Conrad M. Unger
Bill Dillon, Director of Auxiliary Ser­
vices, said that construction of the new 
dormitory space on the hill should begin 
by November, though he cannot guarantee 
occupancy by next September.
Construction is pending city approval of 
building plans for the structure. Dillon 
stated that the city and CMU already have 
an agreement as to the structural quality 
of the building (fire codes, building codes), 
but problems could arise from the set-back 
variances.
Plans call for the buildings to rise closer 
to the property line's than the law allows. 
But Dillon expects no difficulty, as other 
buildings on Margaret Morrison Street 
already violate the variance, and the other 
buildings that the new dorm is too close 
to are also CMU dorms. However, Dillon 
admitted that the destruction of the coops 
could possibly have been for nothing.
officials including an hour meeting with 
Menahem Begin, the Prime Minister of 
Israel and leader of the ruling Likud Party. 
Discussions also took place with Israeli 
Cabinet, Likud Party, and Foreign Minis­
try officials. While many of these discus­
sions concerned business investments by 
American firms in Israel, the contingent 
also received a briefing of the current 
Middle East tumult and maneuvering 
which is occuring prior to reconvening the 
Geneva Conference.
Cyert says “the situation is really much 
more complicated than Americans under­
stand,” and he does not look for any easy 
or quick peace settlement. He continued, 
“Many Arab countries are not willing to 
believe that Israel has the right to be a 
country in the Middle East. The Palesti­
nian Liberation Organization (PLO) has 
sworn to destroy Israel. What most Ameri­
cans don’t understand is the intensity of 
the hate and their strong desire to end 
Israel’s existence. Israel is a homeland to 
the Jews, and they are determined to de­
fend it with their lives.”
Currently there is great pressure being 
exerted by the US on Israel to make poli­
tical and territorial concessions at the 
peace table. Cyert says that “by taking the 
position that Israel must sit down at 
Geneva with representatives of the PLO, 
the US puts Israel in a very bad position. 
On one hand Israel needs the support and 
aid of the US, but on the other hand, the 
US is trying to make them do things which 
are bad for Israel in the long run.” Prime 
Minister Begin has indicated that if Israel 
goes to the peace table following all the 
US suggestions, it would be equivalent to 
the “surrender of his country on the in­
stallment plan.”

Desk operation resumes
by Neil Emerson
The Morewood Desk is back. At least 
that’s what Director of Auxiliary Services 
Bill Dillon says.
According to Dillon, the functions of 
the desk attendant have changed, as well 
as the times he/she is on duty, but the 
desk is very much alive.
Dillon elaborated that the 8 AM to 
4 PM function of the desk is trivial, so it 
has been eliminated. Dillon stated that the 
Housing Office can “more effectively” 
deal with maintenance requests, since desk 
attendants often failed to turn them in 
anyway. The Post Office has taken over 
the distribution of mail, which Dillon 
claims is “their responsibility.” 
Finally, the information tasks have been 
handed over to the Skibo Information 
Desk, since it is better to centralize all in-CMU graduate is activities director

“The students are better dressed and 
seem to be more academically inclined 
than when I was here,” commented Ann 
Witchner, new Director of Student Activ­
ities and 1973 CMU English graduate.
Witchner also noticed that Home­
coming has gained importance since her 
CMU days, and Entropy has opened up in 
what once “could have been a broom 
closet for all I know.” Otherwise Witchner 
has not found many changes in the
school since she graduated.
The new director found her way back to 
CMU via the University of South Carolina, 
where she received her masters degree in 
education, specializing in student's person­
al services; and Allegheny Community Col­
lege, where she served as Assistant Director 
of Student Activities for the past year and 
a half.
After the first two weeks in her new
job, Witchner is still “feeling |her 1 way 
around.” She added (hat she has spent

mese two weeks researching what her pre­
decessors did. and the resources available 
to work with, in order to make her pro­
gram objectives.
Witchner envisions herself as an advisor 
to student organizations and clubs, espec­
ially t)ii budgetary and programming mat­
ters. She feels these groups need help with 
direction and ideas to combat apathy, 
though “the students here are self-moti­
vated and have great initiative.”
The new activities director also sees as a 
major responsibility of her position, the 
development of resources on or near cam­
pus for programs benefiting the entire 
campus community. She would like to em­
ploy these resources in programs like the 
Thursday Lunch Forums, which she hopes 
will resume before the end of the semester. 
She hopes to present lecturers and films of 
interest H> CMU staff and students. .
Witchener also elaborated on a program 
she ran at Allegheny in conjunction with 
the Student Government elections. These 
elections oceured simultaneously with the 
presidential elections last November, so 
the two were tied together by means of a 
week long program of debates by the can­
didates or their representatives on the 
major election issues. This culminated in 
student elections, and a mock presidential 
election. Witchener wants to look into the 
possibility of running that “highly suc­
cessful” program here.
In the near future, however, Witchner 
has plans for science fiction author Ralph
Harlan hllison to speak, and an Activities

formation functions.
However, an assistant to Dillon mans 
the desk from 4 PM to midnight. Dillon 
has this person paid more than an atten­
dant, since it would discourage the high 
personnel turnover that had plagued the 
desk operations in the past. A person of 
similar capacity is stationed in the Donner 
Hall lobby to help with problems in the 
hill dormitories, as a new service. This 
new position is made possible because of 
the elimination of the daytime shift in 
Morewood.
Finally, a desk attendant is on dity 
from midnight to 8 AM in Morewood. 
Since his primary function is surveillance,
and to answer distress calls, keys have been 
issued to all Morewood residents to re­

NEWS BRIEFS
Gallery hit
The Forbes Street Gallery was broken 
into last Monday night.
Nothing was taken, damaged, or moved, 
which led the staff to believe that the 
break-in was “just a prank.”
According to a member of the gallery 
staff, the alarm system was not turned on 
upon closing that night.
Because of the break-in, the Gallery has 
added a hasp lock to the door, which al­
ready has one lock. As an added precau­
tion, the Gallery’s burglar alarm will be 
hooked up to Campus Security.
Also on Monday night, according to 
a Physical Plant employee, vandals stuck 
crowbars into the electric card reading ma­
chines in the parking lots, and destroyed 
the arm-gates of those machines.
Pinball rooms
Make way for the pinball wizard! 
According to Bill Dillon, Director of Aux­
iliary Services, the concessionaire who had 
previously placed pinball machines in the 
Morewood Lobby, and the Donner Base­
ment, until vandalism forced removal of 
the machines, is willing to try again
To protect his machines, the conces 
sionaire is building, at his own expense 
glass enclosed rooms in the two locations 
He will install the machines inside, and 
have them locked up between 3 AM and 
8 AM, when most vandalism, he found, had 
occured.
Dillon commented that he did not know 
when the rooms would be open for busi­
ness, adding that since the university did 
not pay for the construction, they had no 
control over the completion schedule.
Two jobs

Financial Aid Office, students in the Work 
Study Program can hold only one

siblities. Keys were issued to the B-Tower 
entrance, which is inconvenient to the 
E-Tower residents. Dillon promised to 
look into the situation.
In order to beef up security over in the 
hill, Security has added an additional man 
to its late shift. This has been made pos­
sible by relieving Security of a man to 
check for parking violations during the 
day. The university has assumed this 
responsiblity.
Dillon commented that the changes 
came about during the summer, when one 
desk attendant quit, and university officials 
were going through the number of com­
plaints by M.G. residents of unanswered 
distress calls. After recalling that a piano 
was stolen before an attendant’s eyes 
last year, Dillon thought that the security 
aspects should be emphasized, and the in­
formational responsibilities of the desk 
should be minimized, in light of this.
Dillon said the university felt no need to 
consult Sam Grego in his official capacity 
of SDC president on the changes in the 
Morewood Desk. Dillon cited however, 
that Grego, as a Housing Office employee 
last summer, was “probably” abreast of 
the changes planned.
Grego denied this. He also said that 
while the changes in the desk are “better 
than nothing.” he would prefer things the 
“way they were.”

Witchner “is really excited about work­
ing here,” and looks forward to increased 
contact with the student body. She has 
visited most of the organizations already to 
introduce herself. In addition, she hopes to 
form student committees for input on cam­
pus programming.
From the contact Witchner has made
thus far, she has concluded, “The student

It’s great to be back here.”
by Brian Brynes
Few students on campus know that 
there is a commuter council at CMU; even 
fewer know what this council does or is 
supposed to do.
In the past few years, the Carnegie Com­
muter Council of Pittsburgh (CCCP) has 
fallen upon hard times and has received 
very bad publicity. An example of this is 
the current situation concerning the com­
muter rooms in the basement of Skibo.
These two rooms are supposed to allow 
commuters to take showers and sleep over­
night if they so desire. Both of these rooms 
are in poor shape and have had little use. 
One room has been taken over by the jani­
torial service, which uses the room for 
storage.
According to Pat Kelly, president of 
CCCP, he can do little about the situation 
now because of the events of last year. 
During that time, the commuter rooms 
were being used less and less because com­
muters have better facilities at home than 
here. Commuters were mostly worried a- 
bout catching the bus home and hurrrying 
to beat traffic. They were not dependent 
of CCCP services, and so, became apathetic 
towards the council.
When time came for the Student Senate 
to allocate rooms and approve organiza­
tional budgets last spring, CCCP had no re­
presentative present at the meeting. The 
Senate took it upon itself to allocate part 
of a room for the council office, but could 
not pass a budget for the council. So now, 
CCCP has no operating funds and thus no 
funds to improve the commuter rooms 
condition. Kelly said that he has tried to 
get a budget passed in the Senate, but he 
says he has been “ignored by Senate” every 
time he has tried.
The main reason that CCCP has done so 
poorly, according to Kelly, is because CMU 
is a resident-oriented university. Most of 
the activities are geared for students living 
on campus, and the times at which activi­
ties are held are inconvenient for commu­
ters.
Something still may be done to remedy 
the situation. Every student organization, 
including CCCP, has a private monthly 
meeting with Pres. Cyert, where problems 
that the organizations face can be brought 
to the President’s attention, and where he 
may step in at times to get action.
Additionally, the CCCP has placed a 
suggestion box at the Skibo Information 
Desk, in an attempt to arouse interest in 
the group.
Kelly said that the commuter council 
cannot function without commuters inter­
ested in the council, and communication 
between the commuters and the council.

The SDC space
by Stephanie Waite
An unusual protest by angry Henderson 
residents was the main focus of the last 
Student Dormitory Council meeting held 
Sunday, October 2.
Henderson residents have been upset 
over the SDC’s failure to repair their tele­
vision. After attempts through regular 
maintenance channels to get it fixed, they 
submitted a petition to SDC President Sam 
Grego, which stated “We demand a new 
television for Henderson...or you’ll be ga- 
zorched.” Grego received this petition on 
Thursday night. Friday evening, he return­
ed from a night out to find that Henderson 
residents had removed their TV from their 
dorm and placed it in front of his room on 
the first floor of Donner Hall.
Henderson SDC representative Stuart 
Friedman later revealed that they had also 
hoped to set off the TV’s alarm system in 
front of Grego’s room. As a final act of re­
venge, the thieves called Security, told 
them there was a television in front of 
Grego’s room, and asked them to come and 
pick it up.
Friedman said that the Henderson resi­
dents were outraged, because they realized 
that there were other TVs on campus 
which'could be put in their dorm.
Grego sympathized with their position, 
but complained that the act was “not a 
valid protest.”
Renovations committee Chairman Jeff 
Lloyd tried to explain why the television 
had not been fixed. The televisions were 
under contract beginning in 1973 but has 
now expired. Therefore, getting a TV re­
paired could cost the SDC up to $50 dol­
lars. Lloyd said he had gone through all the 
necessary channels to renew the contract, 
but that action had just not been taken 
yet.
In other news, Hill Dorms Head Resi­
dent Corey Chase announced that three

Senate murmurs
by Linda Deak
Senate must have heard rumors that 
prolonged inactivity leads to bedsores, for 
the October 6 meeting generated enough 
controversy on budget approval to com­
pensate for the three week lull.
The Finance Committee submitted for 
Senate’s approval, the minutes of their 
October 3 meeting, which contained revi­
sions in the budgets of WRCT, the Path­
finder and Orienteering Club, Activities 
Board, and Thistle. Senate only approved 
the minutes after carefully ammending the 
revisions to many of the budget proposals.
WRCT had requested that the $150 or­
iginally allotted for paying disc jockies to 
work discos be used to pay a secretary in­
stead. However, as the $150 was generated 
from the discos, a question arose as to 
where the money to pay the secretary 
would come from. Senate voted to allow 
WRCT to pay a secretary with the stipula­
tion that funds will not come out of the 
subsidy allocation.
The Pathfinder and Orienteering Club 
requested an increased allocation in their 
budget. Because the club was denied per­
mission to hold a Class A meet, they asked 
for additional funding to compensate for 
the loss of anticipated entry fees, which 
was approved by Senate.
It was voted to increase the 77-78 
Thistle budget by $265 over the past year’s 
allocation. This pissed in Senate with an 
attached rider requesting that next year’s 
budget be presented in the Spring of ’78, 
and that the organization will work toward 
self-sufficiency as was the intention when 
Thistle was re-instated approximately five 
years ago after encountering severe budget­
ing problems.'1 • ' 1
The Finance Committee had approved 
of allotting $90 to the Activities Board to 
cover charges of phone installation in the 
Doherty Hall 2210 projection room. The 
phone would be used for calls in case of se­
curity or technical problems during the
Precautions aid fire safety
TARTAN NEWS STAFF MEETING
Several points regarding emergency ev­
acuation and fire safety within residence 
buildings need to be brought to the atten­
tion of all resident students. This infor­
mation can be of assistance in helping to 
maintain a reasonable level of dormitory 
safety. This information is provided by 
Bob Anderegg, director of Housing.
1. Residents of any dwelling evac­
uated because of fire are directed to 
contact their parents as soon as 
possible. This may reduce appre­
hension on the part of parents, 
should announcements of tile fire 
be made by the news media.
2. Our local fire alarm pull stations 
are coded, ringing out a numbered 
code which designates the location 
of the pulled alarm. These stations 
are designed to reset automatically, 
after ringing out four or five se­
quences of the alarm code. Unless 
they are absolutely certain that 
no fire exists, residents should 
evacuate whenever an alarm sounds. 
The silencing of the alarm bell 
indicates that the pull station has 
automatically reset, and does not 
signal an “all clear” situation.
3. While residents have been directed 
to move only to the sidewalks of 
the street during drills, under actual 
emergency conditions they should 
cross to the side of the street op­
posite the fire scene or report to a 
designated place of shelter. In this 
manner they would be less apt 
to interfere with the efforts of 
responding firemen.
4. All residents are to be cautioned 
against overloading electrical cir­
cuits by placing an excessive number

Do coed dorms help?Senators announce openings
by Xaveria Zoneball
Former and current residents in the 
co-ed Donner Hall and Welch dorms and 
Woodlawn Apartments reveal startling an­
swers to the provocative question:
“Does living in a co-ed dorm really improve 
your love life (or do you still need 
ultra-brite)?”
Sam Grego “Yes, definitely. More
girls are available, it’s 
easier. SDC is planning 
to have more co-ed 
dorms in the future.” 
Holly Smith “Not the guys who live
in Donner.’'
Frank Suffoletta “No—what is there to
improve?”
Donna Rogosky “No, just no.”
Karyn Hairston “No. First of all — it
doesn’t matter where 
you live on campus be­
cause there isn’t a great 
variety of black males 
to chose from any­
ways.”
Darryl Gresham “Hell no. But 1 think all
dorms should be co-ed 
anyway. When 1 lived in 
Morewood, everyone 
got excited when some­
one said,‘Look, a girl’s 
getting undressed.’ It’s 
great here; the girls 
walk around half naked 
all the time.”
Kathy Schollaert “Yes— it started mine.”
Frank Worbs “No, but the nights
were great.”
Beckv Freeland “Yes! Yes! Yes!”
May Slava “No — due to a bad ex­
perience, but ask me a- 
gain in a month.” 
Anonymous “Go away! We’re right
in the middle of making 
love!”
Kevin Seto “You can’t be talking a-
bout my dorm!”
Jeff Guyette “Yes, I can’t resist the
beautiful women of 
2nd floor Donner.” 
Greg Kaminsky “Yes, it’s fun when you
go into the wrong bath­
room in the morning.” 
Tim Roscoe “I did better when I
was living on the girl’s 
side.”
Matt Kross “Yes! I wish I had a
master key.”
Andy Cannizzaro “No. I live in the bot­
tom floor of Donner 
and it doesn’t even 
seem like a co-ed dorm.
1 see very few girls, 
even in the lounges, so 
it doesn’t affect me.” 
Marsha Fairbrother “Yes. If guys on cam­
pus know there is a 
floor of young, sexy, 
single girls who have a 
reputation for giving 
good parties and being 
very receptive to male 
callers, they are bound 
to check it out.”
Wayne Kriebel “No. They don’t allow 
married couples in Don­
ner Hall.”

showing of the movies. Senators voiced op­
position to such a move, for a few felt that 
it was an unnecessary expense. Also, if it 
was imperative that a phone be installed, 
AB should use Centrex to prevent the risk 
of outside calling. The proposal was voted 
to be returned to AB for clarification, to 
be resubmitted to Senate at a later date.
Aside from arguing on budget proposals. 
Senate managed to squeeze in the remain­
ing officer and committee reports. Dean 
Swank asked for a volunteer from Senate 
to help organize the Central Blood Bank 
blood drive to be held in mid-November.
Any student interested in serving on 
Campus Policy Committees should submit 
their names to John Lubon. He can be 
reached at Theta Xi, or through his mail 
box at the Information Desk. Lubon is also 
searching for responsible, energetic stu­
dents who will claim the positions of Head 
of the ’79 Spring Carnival, and 1979 
Thistle Editor.
Initiating the committee reports, Jim 
Gasbarro, Chairman of Academic Affairs, 
announced that the Educational Affairs 
Committee meeting of the Board of Trust­
ees will focus on the decline in Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores. The meeting will also 
concentrate on how the average CMU stu­
dent compares with this trend.
Vivian Kerstein suggested that Senate 
should investigate reinstating the Student 
Advisory Committees to the departments 
which are not actually represented by the 
Senators from the seven constituencies. 
There is not a working communication be­
tween SAC’s and Student Senate at 
present.
Ken Meinert of Rules Committee, re­
quests that those presenting petitions for 
filling vacant Senate seats should attend 
the October 12 meeting in the Wherret 
Room at 6:00. Petitions must be filed at 
the Information Desk no later than 6:00 
on October 11.
Two jobs
with the same pay rate or with different 
payrates because : The computer cannot 
file or handle two jobs per person; The 
Federal government which funds work 
study, strictly forbids students from work­
ing more than 20 hours a week during the 
school year and 40 hours a week during the 
summer. (Since most summer employers 
want students to work 40 hours a week, it 
is impossible to hold two jobs); and lastly, 
the primary reason for coming to CMU is 
to study, not to earn money.
Next year, a new computer will be 
installed. If it is programmed to handle 
more than one job per student, students 
may be able to work for more than one 
employer during the school year or the 
summer.

adequate and supplies fuel to a fire, 
while the structure itself may de­
crease necessary air space. In an 
emergency, such construction may 
serve to speed the spread of fire 
and increase the danger of smoke 
inhalation.
8. Adequate space for the circulation 
of air should be supplied for heat 
producing appliances, i.e., radios, 
television sets, refrigerators, to 
reduce the possibility of overheating. 
Additionally, high-intensity lamps 
should never be turned on and left 
unattended. These can cause fires 
through spontaneous combustion.
Your individual cooperation regarding the 
above items may serve to aid safety within
campus residence buildings, and further 
assist the University by reducing the 
probability of fire.

Chase is not around to do so. He also an­
nounced the appointment of a new RA in 
Donner Hall, Nina Gattel, 2nd floor.
Under new business, several budget 
allocations were made. Buggy Chairman 
Frank Worbs asked for S63.00 to be spent 
on tools for buggy. When asked what had 
happended to last year’s tools, Worbs re­
plied that he suspected Housing had taken 
them. Funds were also allocated for the 
SDC Homecoming Dance, and to replace 
pool racks which had been stolen.
HOLY THE FIRM 
By Annie Dillard
CMU BOOKSTORE
In 1974 Annie Dillard published Pilgrim 
at Tinker Creek, a mystical excursion in­
to the natural world that established her 
amoung the first rank of American 
writers. Her book received the Pulitzer 
Prize, and the critics compared her 
writing to the writing of Herman 
Melville.
In 1975 Dillard took up residence on an 
island in Puget Sound, in a wooden room 
furnished with "one enormus window, 
one cat, one spider and one person." For 
the next two years she asked herself 
questions about time, reality, illusion, 
death and the will of God.
In her new book, Holy The Firm, she 
bears witness to the violent incursions of 
the Absolute into the wreck of space.

President Cyert believes the US should 
be putting less pressure on Israel. “We can 
no longer look to make Israel behave in 
a conciliatory manner toward the PLO.” 
When questioned about Israel’s settlements 
on the West Bank and other occupied 
areas, Cyert’s response was that the Is­
raelis see their country as a frontier and the 
US should not force them to stop this. He 
feels Israel should not give back any occu­
pied territories from previous wars, saying 
the issue is similar to “manifest destiny” 
from American history (the right of the 
US to settle all the way to the west coast).
From President Cyert’s point of view, 
“the whole question comes down to how 
Israel exists as a country.” He believes “it 
is important to back them because they are 
a democracy surrounded by a series of 
totalitarian governments.”
Concerning the issue of a Palestinian 
homeland, Cyert questions the extent to 
which this is a genuine feeling among the 
Palestinians (that they must have a home­
land). He contends that this is pushed by a 
small band of PLO members, and sup­
ported by the other Arab states to increase 
pressure on Israel. The simplest solution in
tiis mind is “to let Palestians have joint 
citizenship in Israel and an Arab country. 
It would be possible for these people to 
settle in Israel and be important in govern­
ment.” Many countries, including the US, 
allow such joint citizenships in their own 
countries.
President Cyert also addressed several 
educational objectives while in Israel. He 
met with the presidents of Hebrew Univer­
sity, Technion, Tel Aviv University, and 
the Weizman Institute. The Weizman Ins­
titute and Technion are primarily engineer­
ing and research oriented schools.
He said that “in general, CMU was very 
well known and respected among educators 
and researchers in Israel.” Correspondence 
will continue with these universities. 
Student exchange programs are one topic 
of consideration.
Additionally, Israel is strong in solar 
energy development. A man who sells 
solar collectors has offered to donate some 
to CMlFs research in this area. There is 
also the possibility that someone from 
PPG Industries and CMU faculty will go to 
Israel in the future to discuss advances in 
solar energy research.

TARTAN
COMING 
HOME
This year isn’t the only year students have criticized 
CMU. The Class of ’52 complained' too, about housing, 
dose-mouthed administrators, and hokey student elections. 
In those days, the biggest gripe about housing concerned 
“the barracks,” temporary housing structures built by the 
armed forces during WWII. Interaction between students and 
officials was so poor that James Christopher, in a letter to 
the April 22, 1952 TARTAN, wrote, "when [a CMU official] 
died last week, how many of us knew even his name before 
reading it in the local press?” And the Student Government 
election, held in December of 195!, violated at least six dif­
ferent bylaws of the Student Government constitution.
But despite their dissatisfaction with "Carnegie Tech, ” 
members of the Class of ’52 showed up for their 25th class 
reunion this past weekend. Altogether, about 1000 people 
showed up for this year’s Homecoming—that’s counting 
alumni, their families, and friends. About 170 people 
attended the Golden Anniversary Luncheon for the Class of 
1927, and 20 graduates of the Class of 1912 came back. 
One man travelled from India, almost halfway around the 
world, to attend his 25th class reunion.
CMU students must undergo remarkable personality 
changes during the 25 or so years after they graduate.
It’s hard for us today to imagine any of our friends, who 
complain daily about Skibo food, CMU bureaucracy, Pitts­
burgh pollution, academic pressure, the lack of CMU women, 
and the quality of CMU men, travelling just 50 miles to 
reminisce about such things, let alone thousands of miles. 
But some of them probably will, as have people from the 
Class of ’52.
Before the football game, we asked a number of old-timers 
whom they thought would win. Their answers were all pretty 
much the same: “The question isn’t who’s going to win— 
it’s 'how much are we going to win by?’ ” Now that’s loyalty.
The point we are trying to make is not that students 
should sit back, relax, and stop complaining, since in 25 years 
they won’t remember their complaints anyway; rather, we 
are trying to reassure the snowed-under-by-our complaints 
Administration that, in the end, things will work out fine and 
some day we’ll all be friends. But in the meantime, we are 
going to complain, we are going to be antagonistic, and there 
will be times when we’ll be at each other’s throats. Why? 
Because only by complaining will we get what we want. 
(The squeaky wheel gets the grease, right?)
So here’s the deal:
For four years, we’ll criticize you and you’ll criticize us. 
Some things will improve, some things will remain the 
same, and some things will get worse.
But in 25 years or so, some of us will return to wear a 
funny hat, eat a slab of ox (freshly roasted), cheer our­
selves hoarse for the football team, and stand up, with 
tears in our eyes, when the Kiltie Band plays the alma 
mater.
Okay?
See you in 25 years,
Sherry Siegel 
Editor-in-Chief
P.S. How does the alma mater go, anyway?
THOUGHT FOR THE WEEK 
Seeing alumni on campus, like seeing little children and 
dogs, should indicate to us that the world’s population does 
not consist solely of 18—22-year olds. There is something out 
there beyond the boundaries of the CMU campus.
Our president has just returned from Israel; 20 Rhode­
sian students are studying public management and policy; 
CMU’s percentage of foreign students is a visibly large one; 
and Vasily Kuznetsov, an Engineering graduate of the Class 
of ’31, was just elected Vice President of Russia (Vice Presi­
dent of the Presidium, as he is called in Russia).
It seems we are quite cosmopolitan, here at CMU.

Vandalism
Editor:
The Administration’s reaction 
to vandalism breeds an abnormal 
amount of destruction to CMU 
housing facilities. Although Warn­
er Hall occupants disagree, there 
pervades a rationalization that 
the destruction is only a release 
for the student who encounters an 
intolerable amount of work pres­
sure. It is ironic that a university 
which prides itself in integrity and 
professionalism has such a disre­
gard for the uncultivated actions 
of its students.
The constant destruction of 
dorm property is concrete evi­
dence of the attitude, “Why not 
rip up dorm facilities when you 
are angry or drunk? The green 
men will come and patch it up un­
til you feel like destroying it a- 
gain.” There was an incident last 
year of a rowdy student who re­
peatedly tore up his dorm floor
with hockey equipment, in addi­
tion to defacing corridor walls 
and lighting doors afire. The Uni­
versity shirked the responsibility 
of prosecuting the student, sub­
mitting a proposal to the entire 
dorm floor which stated that each 
person would split the cost of re­
pair. When the dorm floor pro­
tested, the guilty student was let 
off with a fine less than the total 
repair bill.
Conflicts between rival fratern­
ities result in many repairs to bro­
ken windows. This expensive dis­
play of dislike is frequently look­
ed upon as a “boys will be boys” 
attitude. During the summer, a 
fraternity .member put a brick 
through a plate glass window of a 
neighboring frat. He admitted to 
the action and was only given an 
Administrative reprimand.
The Administration seems con­
tent with ignoring the seriousness 
of the situation, leaving other de­
partments on campus to cope 
with the vandalism. If heavy fines 
were imposed on first time of­
fenders, with the threat of expul­
sion for repeated acts, the vandals 
might think twice about “releas­
ing their built up work pressures” 
on the dorm facilities. How much 
does a student have to destroy be­
fore the Administration takes ac­
tion? The Administration does 
not have an answer, they are too 
busy handslapping.

want to pay Increased 
Housing Bills
Proper Pride
Editor:
We are two CMU graduates of 
the Hi-Lee Es-Teemed Pittsburgh 
school of driving. We are appalled 
and disgusted with these out of 
state drivers and their piddling 
complaints.
Just who do they think they 
are? They’re lucky we let them in­
to our state, our school-and all 
they do is mouth off and lower

Notice
Editor.:
I wish to thank all the people 
who signed my Student Senate 
nomination sheet, and at the same 
time give notice that because of 
personal reasons, I have decided 
not to run.
I guess I should now say that I 
urge everyone to run for Student 
Senate. Instead, I’ll point out 
that students like myself who
want to do something for stu­
dent government, but can’t make 
the commitment of being a sen­
ator, should attend the Student 
Senate meetings. The people in 
the “gallery” can participate in 
discussions and will be given the 
same consideration as the sena­
tors. Of course, only senators 
can vote.
I do urge people to run for Stu­
dent Senate. But being a senator 
isn’t the only way students can 
be involved. So come to the 
meetings, and help shape Student 
Senate policies.

Food “Service"
Editor:
The other day I went to the 
Skibo snack bar for a quick lunch. 
It appeared to me that the people 
ahead of me in line had all 
ordered and were waiting for food 
to be prepared. I looked over the 
counter and saw that all of the 
food servers were busy except 
one. He appeared to be throwing 
potatoes at the people in the 
kitchen. When he finished this ac­
tivity he turned towards the 
counter and stoood there in front 
of the Tartanburgers with his 
hands in his pockets.
“Would you please give me a 
Tartanburger?” I asked.
“No,” he said.
“Why not?” I asked. “You 
are standing right in front of 
them.”
“It’s not my job,” he replied, 
smiling.
“What is your job?” I asked.
He replied. “I’m an expediter.”

first time we held open meetings. 
This year, we still plan on having 
regular open meetings for the 
commuters and office hours for 
those unable to attend. However, 
student input is critical. To this 
end, a suggestion box has been 
placed at the Skibo information 
desk. All serious suggestions will 
be will be given much considera­
tion.

PITTSBURGH, October 3 - "To Your
Good Health" is the 1977 theme for a 
series of three free lectures designed for 
today's active woman and consumers of 
health services in general. Each lecture 
will feature one or more experts in the 
medical and hospital fields who will 
focus on a topical health concern to be 
followed by a question and answer session 
for the audience.
The series will be held on three con­
secutive Mondays, October 17, 24 and 31 
from 6:00 p.m. to 7:30 p.m. at Kauf- 
mann's, downtown, in the eleventh floor 
auditorium.
On October 17, T.S. Danowski, M.D., 
nationally recognized author and lecturer, 
will address "The Dilemma of Hypogly­
cemia — Food, Fatigue and That Up- 
Tight Feeling." Dr. Danowski is the Dir­
ector of the Department of Medicine and 
the Institute of Graduate Medicine at 
Shadyside Hospital. Sharing the program 
will be Ruth Kantor, R.D., Director of the 
Dietetic Internship Program, also at Shady- 
side Hospital, speaking on "What You 
Eat."
"Managing Stress and Today’s Woman" 
is a subject of concern to many 
professional working women and house­
wives as they try to meet today's demands. 
On October 24, Assistant Professor of 
Clinical Psychiatry, Joan Kyes, R.N.,
M.S.N. will provide insight to this. Miss 
Kyes is the Associate Director of the 
Community Intervention Unit at Western 
Psychiatric Institute and Clinic. 
The last in this series is designed speci­
fically for the consumer who wants to be­
come more knowledgeable when pur­
chasing health care services. On October 
31 "How To Be A Smart Patient — With 
Your Doctor and In The Hospital" will 
feature A. Linn Wiegel, M.D., President of 
the Allegheny County Medical Society and 
surgical staff member of North Hills 
Passavant Hospital and Sister Joanne 
Marie Andiorio, Associate Executive 
Director of Mercy Hospital of Pitts­
burgh.
The "To Your Good Health" lectures 
are jointly sponsored by the Advisory 
Board of Triangle Corner, Ltd., 
Kaufmann's program for women in 
business, the Hospital Council of Western 
Pennsylvania and the Health Education 
Center.
This is the third in this series which was 
originally conceived by Mercy Hospital and 
the Advisory Board of Triangle Corner, 
Ltd.

‘Blob Returns to Local High School
?????by K.A. Yaksich
(This is a true story, a composite of two actual 
Jell-o eating competitions which took place in a 
rural New Jersey town. Only the names have 
been thinly disguised to protect the author from 
a libel suit. You see, truth can be stranger than 
fiction!)
AXLOTOL, NEW JERSEY-Andrew Smith ate 
his way to fame, albeit on a limited scale, in the 
second annual Invitational Jell-o Eating Competi­
tion held at Axlotol Memorial High School. Thir­
ty-seven contestants, representing ten Axlotol 
school organizations and five neighboring high 
schools, vied in five weight classes for the top $10 
savings bond prize. The rules were simple. Each 
contestant merely had to be the first in his or her 
weight class to finish a semi-solid quart of gelatin. 
Here, speed was clearly the determining factor. 
Reflecting that, eating styles varied. Some con­
testants shoveled the bouncy substance into their 
mouths manually, cave-man style. Others were 
equipped with oversized mixing spoons cr 
entrenching tools. Still others just buried their 
face in their bowls and didn't come up for air 
until they heard the judges declare a winner.
The preliminary finalists went on to the 
Championship round, where endurance became of 
paramount importance. Here the object was to 
down—and keep down—as many quarts of Jell-o— 
the first hidden under a quart of whipped 
topping—as possible in five minutes, or until all of 
the opposition dropped out.
The final round was a tense one, but the
145-lb. $mith managed to outlast his fiercest 
competitor, Helene McMill, a 227-lb. starter on 
the school's Varsity Sumo Wrestling Squad. His 
face dripping with whipped cream, Smith smiled 
to acknowledge the capacity crowd's applause, 
then ran to the door yelling, "Bucket!"
When interviewed later, Smith, who prefers 
that unorthodox spelling of his name, told us how 
he became involved in Jell-o competition.
"It all happened in the cafeteria one day, you 
see. I had a jello for dessert, but I didn't have a 
spoon, so I just popped the whole thing into my 
mouth. From there, it just came naturally."
Smith, who represented the AMHS Student 
Council, said he trained for tonight by eating 
entire "La Fiestas"—20-scoop specialty sundaes 
during the preceding week.
Ms. McMill was unavailable for comment.
Other schools' representatives did not fare very 
well; none placed in the preliminary rounds, 
possibly due to their unfamiliarity with the finer 
points of gelatin eating. ; For example, the team 
from Admiral Pysic Military Prep Academy came 
in their full dress uniforms, and seemed loathe to 
drop Jell-o on their marksmanship ribbons.
Another team which did not place but which 
won warm support from the audience was the 
AMHS Dishonor Society, which entertained 
the crowds with their pre-competition warmups, 
complete with DHS sweatshirts and cheerleaders. 
They also aided in post-game clean-up by eating 
the left-over Jell-o (at their own pace). DHS 
"Grand Boob" Kevin Murphy later challenged the 
Honor Society, the event's sponsor, to a re match
at Whitey's Tavern, a challenge which went un­
accepted.
The school nurse and a staff of janitors were 
stationed in the gym in case anything came up. 
The event raised over $200 for the Scarlet Lizard 
Scholarship Fund, to be awarded at graduation to 
a deserving AMHS senior preparing for a medical 
profession.

'C"At Harvard when you get a 
The way to die is to O.D.
At Yale when you're a nervous wreck 
You'll hang yourself around the neck.
At Stanford when you're on probation 
The way to go is suffocation 
And when you're falling out at Brown 
The way to kill one's self is drown,
But schools like these receive such praise,
Cause all the kids are getting A's 
And seeing how these students fare 
We find that suicide is rare 
While way out here at C.M.U.
The teachers know not what to do.
Cause they believe that failure's fun
So in suicides "We're number one!"
Well my friends, as we all know by now, 
C.M.U. had the highest collegiate suicide rate in 
the country. Naturally we wouldn't want to lose 
this high honor, so the Student Senate, in one 
of its more productive actions of the year, spon-
sored the World Series of Suicides, and invited 
students from each of the departments to join 
in the fun. Traditionally the architects have had 
the highest per-capita rate, but this year there 
looks like there could be some strong competi­
tion from both the fine arts and the engineer­
ing departments. The rules are as follows: 
Each contestant will be judged on originality, 
creativity, acting, ingenuity, neatness, shock 
value, school spirit, news value, and this year 
there are two new categories; the ability to 
create sympathy, and the ability to attract a 
crowd of morbid sadists. In this report we will 
run down a list of the top contenders and discuss 
their attempts at victory, may they rest in peace. 
Let's start out with a few fine attempts made by 
students which could not be considered in this 
competition. Our first is Bob Free, who had a 
very interesting idea. Bob climbed to the top 
of the Cathedral of Learning and jumped off, 
shouting through a megaphone "The Cathe­
dral of Learning is a giant phallic symbol in 
the sky, Pitt is sh—, Pitt is sh—, Pitt is sh—."

' Sandy' CK. the
by Jeff Zas/ow
As an eight year old boy, I was caught by a 
snag in the American Dream. I was heavily into 
heroworshipping at the time, and the snag hit me 
like a deliberate wild pitch aimed at my head. It 
was my father who broke the news to me. He sat 
me down after dinner one night and told me that 
there was no way in the world that I'd ever grow 
up to be Sandy Koufax.
I tried giving him my reasoning. He was a rea­
sonable man. I figured that we'd discuss the prob­
lem and come up with a solution. If I couldn't 
grow up to be Sandy Koufax, at least maybe I 
could grow up to be Don Drysdale.
I told him :
"Mike Martin down the street is growing up to 
be Sandy Koufax. And I think that Robby Ran- 
dleman wants to be Sandy Koufax too. I'm not a- 
lone, Dad. All my friends are headed in the same 
direction."
Well, my father decided to attempt a complete 
explanation.
"There's only one person in the world who 
could ever grow up to be Sandy Koufax, and he's 
done it already." He said.
I grimaced, and clenched my fists, afraid that 
Robby Randleman had beaten me to it. If only 
one of us could make it, I'd rather it would be me 
then him. Robby couldn't throw a ball farther 
then he could spit. I turned my head to hold back 
the tears.
My father sensed my disappointment and tried 
to help me understand the situation.
"It's one thing to grow up to be like Sandy 
Koufax. But you're going to grow up to be you; 
not him. That's just the way things work in this 
world. You start out as someone, and you end up
as that same someone. No one has done it any 
other way,'' he said, but that was in the days be­
fore Renee Richards.
I looked at my father and studied him, trying 
to figure out a motive for his statements. I 
couldn't decide what my father disliked about my 
ambition. Then I hit on it. I should have realized 
it sooner.
My Dad wanted me to grow up to be him!
merican GDream
Of course! He wouldn't be a bad guy to grow 
up to be. He was pretty smart. He was a family 
man. He supported his wife and kids. Maybe it 
wouldn't be so bad to grow up to be my father.
No. That would get pretty boring after a while. 
My father wore a toupee, not a baseball cap, and 
he never signed autographs, except on checks. He 
wasn't athletic at all. And no one outside of his 
own little world had heard of him. Even the 
lady who lived across the street wasn't so sure 
who my father was. No. Being my father just 
wouldn't work out. I decided to be honest.
"Forget it Dad. I don't want to grow up to be 
you. I'm sorry."
My father just laughed.
"I don't want you to grow up to be me. I've
done that already. So you can't do it."
After he said that, I'd have to say that I lost a 
little respect for him. Of all the people in the 
world that he could grow up to be, the man had 
the gall and over-ego to grow up to be himself\ I 
glared at him.
"Look son. Here's my recommendation. Lis­
ten to me and I'm sure that you'll get it all 
straightened out in your mind."
My father, of course, had his remarks prepared 
well in advance. My mother had clued him in on 
my behavior three days earlier. And she was very 
worried. I'd been running around the house loos­
ening up my arm and assuring the Press (my little 
sister) that my elbow would be fine, just fine. 
And I kept trying to call Mrs. Koufax in Los Ang-
CONTINUED ON PAGE 16Suicide
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 12 
Upon hitting the ground, Bob suffered a 
broken ankle, and a sprained wrist. Death 
occurred a day later when hs was approached 
by the entire Pitt football squad, and had his 
dialogue of the previous day's activities 
I questioned. Unfortunately, Bob's suicide was 
made off campus, and so his attempt can not be 
included in the official competition.
One successful, although accidental attempt 
was made by a girl in Donner. While she was 
taking a shower, all five toilets were flushed at 
the same time. The girl (whose name is being 
withheld until notification of her next of kin) 
was cremated alive, and her ashes lost down the 
. drain. The judges have given her a 7.1, and 
thank her for her entry.
Another accidental death made in the area of 
temperature was made by Lon Lee, a senior 
grad student who had never been kissed. Lon 
died of hypothermia from too many cold 
showers. Due to the fact that almost all of the 
men at C.M.U. have a slightly similar problem, 
Lon ended up with a mere score of 4.5.
A fine school spirit effort was made by I.
Ron Stomach. As you remember in last year's 
competition, Ron tried to poison himself by 
staying on the 21 meal plan at Skibo. This year 
Ron has a new idea, and let's talk to him about 
it now:
"What are you doing this year, Ron?"
"Die of malnutrition, that is my ambition." 
"Is there any particular reason for you carry­
ing out your hunger strike inside the alum­
inum sculpture of the cut here?"
"Yes, well that's because I like to scare the 
security guys when they walk by and hear 
a talking sculpture."
Unfortunately, Ron is still alive after 6 months 
of starvation. The doctors believe the reason 
is that not eating at all has the exact same 
nutritional value as Skibo food, and so Ron's 
body had become used to it long ago.
One of the quickest deaths on record was that 
of Bjorn Sven Jones who tried to cut in front of 
362 people in the bookstore line on the first day 
of the semester. It took a mere 56 seconds tor 
the crowd to eliminate him, and toss his remains 
out of Baker Hall.
The competition was truly fierce, but the un­
animous winner of this year's "World Series of 
Suicide" was Herman Fonsworth Fatsomato IV. 
Herman tied himself to the fence, and stayed
there until, he was pronounced dead from skin 
suffocation, and lead poisoning from the 21 
layers of paint that had been put on him. Her­
man received a score of 9.7, and a letter of 
congratulations from the deans of each 
department. His parents have been given the 
$538.62 prize money, and rumor has it that 
they are using the winnings to take a trip to 
the famous city of North Oshkosh, Saskatuwan, 
which was the birthplace of Daniel Elsberg's 
psychiatrist.
Over 127 contestants participated in. the 
series, may they rest in peace. Some of the strong­
er department totals are as follows: Fine Arts 32, 
Engineering 29, Architecture 31, H&SS 20, Se­
curity 6 (these were all due to heart attacks from 
the talking sculpture), and the faculty chalked up 
9 this year.
And so folks, there you have it, this year's 
World Series of Suicide sponsored by your Stu­
dent Senate. Keep your eyes open for the next 
competition in the spring, when Student Senate 
will sponsor the "Stanley Cup of Communicable 
and Terminal Diseases." Until then, this is Sloppy 
Joe Shlabotnikwitz saying good-bye and good 
luck.
This has been a Prune Arlidge Presentation.

SURVIVAL
by Betsey A. Lynn
The room was filled with a melange of person­
alities gleaned from wargame conventions, college 
campuses, and the dark drawing rooms of the 
odd. Orange and brown down stuffed chairs 
engulfed these participants in this first world's 
finals...however o' what none of them were too 
terribly sure. Eyes searched the room, from over 
newspapers and folded hands, looking for some­
thing familiar. Accidentally a pair of eyes meet 
and instantly they both start frantically trying to 
find something to pretend they had been staring 
at all along.
Norman Weiss found two blue eyes had 
caught his. He quickly developed an interest in 
the room's furnishings. Too stuffy, he thought, 
you could smother in these old chairs. He pushed 
himself to a standing position and roamed around 
the collection of junk: a stuffed dragon, ceramic 
elves on toadstools, a huge painting, of a decapi­
tation. On the coffee table sat books on sorcery, 
mysticism, and the occult. The hanging lamps 
strongly resembled lanterns and torches. He 
crossed to look out the lead glass windows.
"Damned odd..."
"What?" the girl with the blue eyes asked com­
ing up next to him.
"That." he pointed to the driveway two floors 
below. A thin man, no more than five foot ten, 
dressed in a green velvet cape, medieval leggings 
and a silver tunic was handing his horse to a 
squire.
Up in the room seven people crowded around 
the small casement window.
"Do you suppose that's Reilly Thomlinson?" 
the blue eyed girl spoke.
"I hope so, I'd like to know what all this is 
about."
"I trust I haven't kept you all waiting too long?" 
Behind them the caped man had entered the 
room. The cape draped rakishly over one shoul­
der. He seemed alot taller than he actually was. 
"I'm sorry to have kept you waiting at all, but it 
was," he smiled and showed glowing, even teeth, 
"unavoidable." His eyes danced with light, they 
exuded trust. His age was indeterminate, he 
looked about twenty but there was a lingering 
air of age and wisdom that settled around his 
person. He mesmerized his guests. "Please be 
seated." Thin white hands, obviously unaccus­
tomed to work, fluttered and directed them to 
sit down.
"My name is Reilly Thomlinson, I am your 
host here for, well, an indeterminiate stay, shall 
we say. You are all here by my express personal 
invitation. None of us have met before, but I 
assure you, you were all chosen for this champi­
onship game tor many reasons. You are all lovers 
of fantasy and science fiction. Tolkein, Zalazny, 
Moorcock are all familiar names to you. You ex­
cell in the many areas of imagination. Each of 
you has read with an almost scholarly intensity 
the adventures of a variety of mythical creatures 
in various locales and terrains. Your proven ima­
gination and interest have qualified you gentle­
men," he nodded towards the blue eyed girl, 
"and of course you too, Ms. Korman, to partici­
pate in this world series."
"That's the question we need answered, Mr. 
Thomlinson, just what is the game to be played in 
this 'world series' of yours?" Estelle Korman 
crossed her legs in a business-like fashion. Her 
cerulean blue eyes were hard and her stare re­
mained taut on the silver tuniced man.
"Very good, Ms. Korman. A direct question. 
Simple. Succinct."
"That's no answer, Mr. Thomlinson."
"That's right, Thomlinson," Norman Weiss was 
on his feet, punctuating his words with jabbing 
thrusts of his index finger. "Your invitation pro­
mised us an 'exciting, rewarding experience.' 
You said that this competition's winner would re­
ceive 'world wide exposure.' What you didn't 
tell us, Thomlinson, was what this game of yours 
is."
The others nodded their consent to Norman's
challenge of authority. Seven pairs of eyes fo­
cused on Reilly Thomlinson.
Reilly produced a nail clipper from his pockets 
and proceeded to clip his manicured nails. His 
lean body eased against the fireplace, he slowly 
smiled to put his guests at ease. "Good, good. 
Challenges. Refusal to take everything at face 
value. I see I have chosen you all well." He stood 
up straight and crossed to stand directly in front 
of the fire. Orange-yellow light played on the 
back of his green tights. His aristocratic face with 
its slightly too large nose was swaddled with 
shadow.
"Gentlemen and Ms. Korman, you are here 
for the greatest contest ever known. You are here 
for the world's series of survival."
In the stunned silence the seven participants 
could hear a stone grating on stone sound. A 
creaking and grating sound that burrowed its way 
into their teeth. Thomlinson padded across the 
intricately wrought oriental rug. For the first 
time Norman Weiss noticed the pattern. It was 
made up of different figures committing suicide 
in various ways. Norman felt his stomach tie 
itself in knots as he saw a stone slab cover the 
doorway.
Estelle Korman lunged for a window. Muscles 
straining beneath her cotton shirt, she could 
not budge the window frame.
"It won't open, Estelle," Reilly sat down on the 
coffee table, he picked up a heavy pewter candel- 
stick and handed it to her. "Why don't you try 
this?"
She grabbed the pewter and banged it against 
the window. She swung it first like a bat. then 
like a broadsword, finally she just hurled it at the 
stubborn window. The lead crystal glass spar­
kled mockingly back at her in the sun.
Norman Weiss threw his body into a rush at 
the other window. It didn't break; he merely 
bruised his shoulder.
"Nothing will work gentlemen, you're welcome 
to try though. You'll find that none of you can 
leave until the game is over."
|j leaning against the fireplace, "All you have to 
: do is use your immense imaginative storehouse 
and tactical knowledge to remain alive.
"I have designed personas for you all that 
are not very different from your own selves. 
You, Ms. Korman, are an Eastern University stu- 
! ij Mj dent, majoring ostensibly in writing, but you in- v 
^[LLLitend to go into theatre in some form. Your^ 
• interest in the occult is admirable.
In my world you will be a proud and willful 
woman not unlike yourself. You will carry a 
==sword at your side to defend yourself. You will 
fjj-be also like the succubi of old, beautiful and en-

Mr. Weiss, you are normally a timid soul, a 
ibrary assistant at the New York Public Library. 
You have a tendency to "borrow" books and not 
return them. In my world, you carry bow and 
arrows. Your occupation is thief."
Reilly described the others, slowly, methodical­
ly. He recited as if quoting his own bible. Math- 
ew-a mace-wielding carpenter. George Musaka, ca, 
usually a computer science specialist, a technical 
weapons genius armed with a laser. Paul Jewison, 
poet and dreamer, became an elf-like creature 
able to cast mystical spells. Andrew Campbell 
and Michael O'Hare were fighting men in both 
worlds. They carried armour and broadswords. * 
Michael also "carried" a blunt club-like stick.
"There, now are there any questions before the 
game begins?" He looked around the stunned 
room. "Nothing any of you wants to ask?"
"Get on with it." Norman was impatient, 
Estelle fearful. The others shocked.
f; *r. ***** « v:r :

Spent, they rested in chairs or lounged on the 
floor. Reilly Thomlinson had remained unper­
turbed. He had watched them pound and beat 
and kick at the w;ndows and door with a semi­
amused detachment. He watched them wijh a 
mild interest; they watched him with a growing 
aDDrehension.
Finally Norman spoke. "All right, Thomlinson, 
what's this game of yours? Bring out the board 
and let's get started."
"I'm afraid this is no simple board game, Mr. 
Weiss. You are all going to populate a fantasy 
world of mine. I will be your senses. I will tell 
you what you see, hear, smell, feel. I will effect­
ively link you into my world. Your jobs there 
are simple. Just survive." Reilly went back to
Reilly Thomlinson described the terrain over 
which their personas traveled. At first trees were 
thick and plentiful, the waters of occasional 
streams sweet and clear. But now the soil was 
getting sandy, the trees stunted and sparse. The 
water became non-existant.
As Reilly desribed their manifestations of 
thirst they all felt them. "They" had now gone 
two and a half days without water, when reality 
and Paul's timex indicated two and a half hours. 
But the reality of their swollen tounges and 
gaging throats could not be denied.
Estelle Korman was sucking on the sleeve of 
her shirt. She had ripped it off long ago to soak 
up the sweat from her brow. She now sucked it 
to keep her mouth operable. She could see Mich­
ael O'Hare and Andrew Campbell gagging to death.
Reilly had only said, "Michael, Andrew, I'm 
afraid your constitutions are too .low, you're 
going to die of dehydration in a few minutes, 
that's actually days game time, if it's any con- 
sulation to you."
Suddenly the two dropped and slumped 
forward. Estelle and Norman rushed to check 
their pulses. They had none. Looking in Michael 
O'Hare's mouth, Estelle could see the effects of 
dehydration. She screamed.
"Everything you say is happening, Thomlin­
son!" Estelle screeched at his face, she clawed 
his hand with her fingernails, "you just 
talked those two men to death! That's imposs­
ible!"
"All any of you had to do was ask for water 
in a canteen when you had the chance. Their 
imanginations failed them. Right now, in this 
room, my world is the only real one. Gentlemen, 
Ms. Korman, shall we continue?"
Norman stood up and stalked over to the 
complacent Reilly. "These men are dead, they're 
really dead, Reilly!"
"I said this was the world's series of survival."
Paul Jewison's head lay at Norman's feet. The 
poet had been in the rear of the group. He had 
not looked behind him. The knight of sorts had 
decapitated Paul an hour ago. Estelle was grateful 
the body had not yet begun to stink.

> 4Sir, your mother wears...”
by Fred LaPointe
"And a jolly good morning to you, guv'ner. 
Seems a fair weathered day for this sport."
The appearance of my competitor was a sur­
prise to me since I had expected a typical country 
practioner. He was rather a thin man with a long 
nose like a prominent edifice positioned between 
two keen grey eyes set rather closely together, 
brightly shining through a thick pince-nez. I 
firmly shook his hand and assured myself, lest I 
became too overconfident, that the slovenly dres­
sed man with the air of peering benevolence was 
truly an indomitable foe, his innocuous appear­
ance his most deadly asset. Calmly, I lit my pipe 
though my nerves thrilled with the anticipation of 
the coming struggle. My eyes wandered from my 
opponent to the golden sun that was already ris­
ing, catching the verdant siopes beneath me in 
their uncultivated beauty. A haze lay low upon 
the farthest skyline from which jutted fantastic 
granite slopes. One great bird soared aloft in the 
blue heaven.
Crack! A pistol split the silence of the dawn. I 
whirled about but, alas, lost the advantage.
"Sir, if your total gray matter was analagous to 
quantities of nitroglycerin you would be incapa­
ble of blowing your nose."
"Aha!" I thought, "a typical opening move for 
which I had a ready counter."
"Sir, is that your nose, or is a pyramind mis­
sing?"
He flushed full in the face, but 1 knew that was 
solely a trick to set me off guard, evidence of his 
previous acting experience on the London stage.
"My kind sir, the inaccuracy of your feeble 
perceptions lends credence to the possibility of an
entire universe of space housed between your 
ears."
"Sir, are those eyeglasses or are you returning 
them for a nickel deposit?" I immediately re­
torted.
"My dear fellow, surely your imagined intelli­
gence will initiate the start of a negative system 
for Intelligence Quotient tests."

The cWhir*led Cer*es
by Mark Aksoy
I am not at all certain that anybody will believe 
me (sip) but to me it is.an inescapable conclusion. 
And if one examines each piece separately...why 
it all fits together, doesn't it (sip)?...take Howard 
Cosell and Myron Cope...they don't talk like we 
do, so they must be aliens. Where were they be­
fore they were born on earth? And the whole 
mystery of comets...we still don't know where 
they come from or why (gulp). If we only had 
radiotelescopes big enough to listen in...
1650 A.D. "...and Myron, it looks like spatial 
conditions in this stellar sector will be near 
perfect for this, the opening game of the 
40th Millenial Galactic Cometary Starshoot!"
"...and what a game it's going to be, Ho­
ward! This millenium, the target is going to 
be a solar system of 9 planets surrounding a 
small yellow star only 10 light years away..."
But alas, our radiotelescopes aren't powerful 
enough, and I am reduced to a voice crying in 
the (sip...gulp) wilderness. For centuries man has 
gazed upwards at the (hie) night sky and asked 
one of 2 questions: Are we alone? (for e'ear
skies) or Is it going to rain tomorrow? (for cloudy 
skies). Unlike the second (hie), the first question 
was never answered. Furtive minds cringed at the 
idea of alien invaders intent on enslaving human­
ity. Bolder, more imaginative people dreamt 
(burp) of learning the secrets of existence from 
near-godlike races of beings. But it would 
be the crowning blow to mankind's ego if the 
terrible truth ever reached our planet that our
solar system is regarded by the rest of the galaxy 
as little more than a cosmic pinball machine...!
1800 A.D. "From where we are now, suspended 
here in space, we can see the play-by-play 
action as it unfolds..."
"...and the wrist action of that Arcturian 
was just fantastic, Howard!...pulling out that 
plunger on the control panel and letting it go 
with such expert precision!...that comet is 
launched on a perfect trajectory!"
"Myron, you've got to give some credit to 
to the superior conditions of the course... 
the interstellar dust between here and the tar­
gets has been cleared out and replaced by 
artificial Astro-dust. With any luck he might 
hit the third planet and score 100 points or 
even another free comet!"
Of course, it should be (hie) evident that these 
games of theirs last for thousands of years because 
they have much longer life spans than we 
do (excuse me, | pnust go to the little boy's
room)......uhh, oh yes, and so they let their
comets leisurely drift toward their destinations. 
And obviously, they know by now that the earth 
is inhabited (hey, my ice has melted)—that's why 
Cope and Cosell are walking among us with an 
equally obvious mission. The only way to get 
4 billion earthlings to accept the fact that they 
live on a vulnerable target worth only 100 points 
would be to raise their collective sports conscious­
ness (slurp-(drool)to the point where they'd be 
more enthusiastic about the game than fearful 
for their safety (burp)...and Myron and Howard
ing course, you would only speed up your ignor­
ance."
"Touche," I thought, "surely on that parley I 
scored well with the judges."
He looked me sternly in the face with that im­
peccable cleft chin of his.
"Sweet fellow, I do not mind rampant ignor­
ance, but despise, as in your case, when it is or­
ganized."

are only the beginning...why, if I were you, I'd 
keep an eye out for an increase in the number of 
garrulous sportcasters with strange singsong ac­
cents!...yeah...
1908 A.D. "What a hit that was, Myton!...right 
on the edge of Lake Baikal, Siberia. Our re­
mote camera circling the third planet shows an 
immense crater marking the spot...and the 
point advantage is definitely on the side of the 
Arcturian team here..."
"You know, Howard, that reminds me of 
the 12th Galactic Starshot held in this same so­
lar system when the Tau Cetians made that 
stupendous hit right on the fifth planet smash­
ing it into thousands of asteroids..."
Hey, bartender, turn up the volume on the TV!
I want to hear what that guy is saying...Thanks 
(burp—drool).
The Present (on Channel 2) "...and has been
actively studied by a number of observatories 
allowing refinements to be made of its predic­
ted path. We now conclude that it will pass 
very close to and possibly impact on the major 
asteroid Ceres with sufficient force to send it 
spinning..."
"You mean, Dr. Flederschwein, that we 
might end up, heh, heh, with a whirled Ceres?"
Don't worry, Mr. Professor, (getting up from 
this table is harder than I thought) someday the 
truth will be revealed...on ABC's Wide World of 
Sports (gag)! Well (stagger)...think I'll crawl a 
cross the street and order a pizza. You know,

start using black holes, the game (stagger) will 
really be exciting and (slam)...

Sandy GK.
CONTINUED FROM PAGE 13 .
eLes to tell her I couldn't make it home for din­
ner. Anyway, because my mother took my mix- 
up so hard, my,Dad was extra inspired to say just 
the right things to me. He began:
"Son, grow up to be proud of yourself. What­
ever you do."
I figured that I'd be pretty proud pitching a no 
hitter, so why couldn't I be Sandy Koufax? But 
while I was thinking that, my father kept batter­
ing down my dream.
"You weren't meant to be Sandy Koufax. 
You're a special boy, and you'll be a special man. 
And praise all of creation, you'll be your own 
self. A unique individual." A pause in the action 
there so he could think of what he wanted to say 
next. Then he continued, "I can see why you 
have overwhelming respect for Sandy Koufax. 
He's a good man. A great pitcher. He won the 
World Series for the Dodgers last year almost 
single handedly—or at least single armedly. That 
left arm of his is the greatest fast ball thrower in 
history."
My father was suddenly getting a sort of natur­
al high thinking about the mastery of Sandy's 
fastball. If I didn't know better, I'd have sworn 
that he wished he was Sandy Koufax also.
"All I'm saying, son,-is to get excited about 
your future as you, and you'll have no trouble 
growing up to be a man that the boys of the next 
generation will admire."
He didn't ask me for my response. He just 
stood up, and went into the living room, turned 
on the T.V. Game of the Week, and the discussion 
was finished.
But not only was the discussion finished; my 
American dream was finished also. My father had 
convinced me that out of the millions of people 
in the world, I would only be one of them. I'd on­
ly be myself. What a letdown! What a bummer!
With that knowledge it wasn't worth admiring 
anyone. So if I couldn't be anyone except myself, 
there was no one worth admiring except myself. 
Yes, Neil Armstrong walked on the moon and 
Tom Jones unbuttoned his shirt, but I didn't 
care much. I was stuck growing up to be me, not 
them, And I was slowly building a self-glorifica­
tion complex.
I'd walk around the house getting psyched 
for my future. I was just a little guy with a sud­
den parentally built in ego trip. I'd tell my father:
"Dad. Don't worry about paying the rent. I'll 
be setting you up as the Pope as soon as I'm re­
cognized as the messiah."
I was a boy with tremendous ambition.
"Dad, I'll probably be running the three min­
ute mile by the time I'm sixteen, so there's no 
need worrying about teaching me to drive. I 
won't be needing a car."
I was really taken with myself. Sandy Koufax 
was a waterboy compared to the things I was 
planning for myself.
"Mom and Dad, I'll probably be inventing the 
cure for cancer within the next decade, so there's 
no need to quit smoking."
! was just taking my father's advice, but it was 
the wrong way to approach the American Dream. 
Before I knew it, my mother requested that I 
have another chat with Dad.
"Son, it's one thing to want to make your 
mark on the world, but it's another thing to want 
to make your mark on the universe. Just calm 
down and be realistic. Rome wasn't built in a day, 
and Sandy Koufax's fastball didn't become 
wicked in the first inning he pitched. So under­
stand that you probably won't be successful. Be
as realistic as you can. It's better in the long run. 
Do you understand?"
Yes, I did. I was older at that point. Ten or ele­
ven, I guess, and it was then that I realized what 
my father was telling me. There really was no 
American dream. He knew.
I would be smarter settling down into a life of 
complacent boredom, then trying to reach for 
stars that were far from my ballpark. In fact, the 
more I thought about it, my Dad was telling'me 
to grow up to be something like him. A nice, all 
around, nobody, who couldn't get three strikes 
over the plate if he was standing on it.
And my Dad's predictions were right. Neither I 
nor Robby Randleman, nor Mike Martin ever 
grew up to be Sandy Koufax. They grew up to be 
college radicals. I grew up to be in my father's 
image. And as for my father, he didn't do much 
growing. He's still the same guy he was. And he 
still only signs his autographs on checks, usually 
made out to CMU, or me.
I'm not really troubled about who I'm going to 
be, anymore. I have no American Dream whatso­
ever. I eat, study, and go to class. My ambitions 
aren't much more complicated then getting up in 
the morning. I'm just the average American. And 
the average American has no American Dream to 
keep his mind busy.
Only sometimes, when I've reached the point 
of supreme boredom with my nobodiness, I find 
myself slipping just a bit. I know my father and 
mother wouldn't like it, but I can't help myself.
It happens when I sleep, because sleep is the 
only time I can't suppress my dreams. I'm caught 
by them when I'm asleep.
The situation is this:
The crowd is roaring. I'm batting in the seventh 
game of the World Series. There are two outs. It's 
a full count. It's the ninth inning. My team is 
down by a run. And the bases are loaded. I know 
its's not too original, but like I said, I'm dreaming 
and I can't control it.
I step into the batters box. I'm myself in this 
dream. Not Roberto Clemente or Joe DiMaggio. 
I'm just little old me.
The pitcher looks familiar to me. I've seen his 
face on baseball cards and in the Sports section. 
Why yes. How could I mistake him? It's Sandy 
Koufax!
He winds and delivers. I foul a few off. The 
tension is mounting. Again he winds and delivers. 
Like a machine.
I swing and smack the ball. It hits poor Sandy 
right between the eyes, scoring a run and ending 
Sandy Koufax's life.
My dream continues. I don't become a hero be­
cause the whole wide world loved Sandy Koufax, 
and I'd killed him.
But my subconscious is very satisfied at the 
end of that dream. I'm glad that Sandy Koufax is 
dead, because he was what I could never be. And 
it wouldn't be fair to give him all the glory. If I 
couldn't be Sandy Koufax, then he shouldn't be 
allowed to be Sandy Koufax either.
I realize that that dream is the epitome of sour 
grapes, but I don't worry about it. Some of us 
were meant to be 'somebodies' and some of us 
were meant to be 'sour grapes'. I wish that I was 
meant to be Sandy Koufax, but things didn't 
work out. Understandably, my subconscious has 
to commit murder to make up for it.
Now, if I ever have a son, I think that I'll let 
him grow up to be anyone he wants to be. It can't 
hurt. Just think. If my Dad had let me grow up to 
be Sandy Koufax, I'd be in the Hall of Fame right 
now. Wouldn't that be great? Wouldn't everyone 
be proud of me?
And if I was in the Hall of Fame, I'm sure that 
my son would want to grow up to be me.
And if he wanted to grow up to be just like his 
Dad, I'd do nothing to get in his way.

World Contest
by Karen Joy Ravets
Topaz flecks of light danced in the pocket 
crystal held by Stark, a sun-bronzed man of 
Old World Scandinavian features. The near star 
had made many revolutions since the destruction 
of his first home. He thought of Am and walked 
toward her nest across the field.
Passing through a ring of wild yellow yukka 
plants he was greeted by the familiar blue poppy- 
flke flowers that surrounded the lone, but im­
portant structure. A pinkish hide tent propped 
up with yellow branches served as the dwelling. 
Inside, a fire-flushed woman slept on yukka mats 
between lengths of white thick-haired hide. Sens­
ing another, she opened her eyes and in finding 
the noise source, smiled.
She approached the man, putting a cool palm 
to his cheek. Their blue eyes met and he remem­
bered the ways of his Old World affection. He 
touched her abdomen and wondered with whom 
their child would share this special feeling. The
only other form of humanoide life was the Wild 
Ones.
Although forewarned of their existence Stark 
had not seen them until his woman's shape had 
changed, and then only once. Two females with­
out apparent seed companions, they had been 
dressed in the way of men. One wore a green 
skin, the other a brown, as if they, instead of him­
self and his mate had come from Erde and were 
remembering its beauty. Yet, their bare breasts 
hung loose, chapped by the elements in an un­
gainly way.
Moving through the underbrush, the unknown 
zone beyond the garden under the yukkas, they 
had broken twigs and small creatures with their 
feet as they passed. Like Old World cats their 
eyes blazed and their throats shook, only, daggers 
replaced claws.
Until his own glistening steel piece answered, 
he had been forced down by these metal fingers, 
whose owners then returned through the thicket 
that had belched them out.
Aware of a break in the peace of mind of the 
man that gently touched her, Am looked up at 
him with puzzling pastel orbs. Noting the mad 
music of her heart Stark reached out a muscular
hand. They comforted each other in the way of a 
man and woman while shadows breathed outside.
A brown, weathered hand stifled Am's screams 
as she saw through wide eyes Stark's drugged 
body being pulled toward the nest's opening. Her 
mate was to die in propagating another species.
Flinging off the wild woman Am pulled a burn­
ing yarrow stalk from the glowing pile. It was in 
blood and dirt that Stark, on returning, saw her 
cover her opponent. He came back, with the 
other female's head, taken in the tradition of his 
race, also covered with the red and blue blanket.
Under the nodding azure flowers a dirt-garbed 
barbaric she-thing had torn at the clothes and 
flesh of this dazed man with the steel knife from 
her girdle. Aware of the heat of pain, Stark had 
opened his crusted lids long enough to recognize 
the woman-beast.
His dagger hand had grasped and was filled. 
The foe, too, had had a knife.
Beyond Am, the pinkish skin structure 
propped up by yellow branches was ablaze. It 
was with this fire that she cleaned his wounds, 
and by whose light he placed his arms about her 
as they realized the meaning of their lost Erde.

cBen Harry’s cWforld Series
Prediction
(editor's note: Ben Harry, world renowned odds- 
maker, has been predicting the outcome of World 
Series games since his birth in 1925. Ben's father 
first discovered that Ben had a talent for predict­
ing during the '25 World Series. Ben's mother was 
extremely pregnant that October, and Ben's fa­
ther swore that if the baby was a boy, then Pitts­
burgh would win. Ben was born a boy, and Pitts- 
&burgh won the Series. As news of this spread, Ben 
became world famous. As an infant, in 1926, Ben 
Harry's Dad flipped him in the air and declared, 
"If It's heads, then St. Louis wins. Tails and it'll 
be the Yankees." Ben Harry landed heads, St. 
Louis won, but that was just the beginning. Since 
1925, Ben Harry has never been wrong in his pre­
dictions. However, veteran oddsmakers tend to 
~t doubt Harry's choice for World Champions this 
~ year. They say he's picked a long shot. We'll just 
have to wait and see.)
The Prediction: 
by Ben Harry
Although the Dodgers won the National 
League pennant in four games this past week, 
they will realize on Tuesday evening that they 
didn't deserve the victory. Philadelphia is the best 
“ team in baseball, no questions about it. Dodger 
Manager, Tom Lasorda will hold a Press Confer­
ence before the opening of the World Series to
announce that his players will be taking a team 
vacation in Guam, and will not participate in any 
more baseball until 1978. On behalf of his team, 
he will ask the Phillies to represent the National 
League in the Series.
This announcement will come as no surprise. 
Philadelphia fans will have been rioting in the 
streets until their team is allowed in the Series, 
"he Los Angeles community, afraid of the vio­
lence spreading West, will give way and allow the 
Phillies to replace the Dodgers in the games.
Although the World Series is best out of sev­
en games, the Phils will dominate the play in the 
first game to such a degree that the American 
League will be forced to concede the World Ser­
ies. At the end of the seventh inning of the first 
game, the Yankees will walk into their dugout 
and will not return, declaring the Phillies as World 
Champions.
The Phillies will be so stunned by their upset, 
(especially since they didn't expect to see a base­
ball again until April) that there won't be any 
champagne in the locker room. They'll be forced 
to break .open bottles of aftershave to celebrate 
their astounding victory.
So, here's my prediction for the 1977 World 
Series: Philadelphia Phillies will be victors, taking 
the crown in game one.

^ "Blast!" I thought, "he's got the best of me 
and I must retort in another two seconds and my 
pipe has gone out!"
"Faint praise never won fair lady!" A leery 
smile died on my face as I realized what I had ut­
tered, not some disparaging remark but rather 
some jejune quote memorized long ago before 
some stern schoolmarm brandishing a whip and 
^ chain. A smirk left my opponents lips as the sting 
of the judges' "Foul!" burned in my ears.
"It would appear that you are reliving your 
childhood which irregragably ended only a few 
days ago."
"Foul!"
Aha! The insouciant wastrel neglected the obliga­
tory opening kind word or phrase indicative of a 
true gentleman and scholar in this fierce debacle.
"Sir." I looked him squarely in the face, "your 
face would make a train take a dirt road."
Truly this was an insult taken from the bawdry 
afternoon playgrounds but proofed like some dry 
vintage Chablis it drained the colour from my 
loyal opposition's iowels. He motioned his hand 
as if to punctuate some chilling words and stam­
mered—
I "Beloved foe, if...if..."
—but not within the time limit and I quickly 
seized the upperhand.
"Sir, you are indeed so ugly, that at birth the 
doctor did not know where to slap you."
He appeared visibly shaken, as he nervously 
wiped his pince-nez with a handkerchief he had 
previously employed upon his bulbous protru- 
berance. It appeared his eyes were getting moist, 
glistening in the warm sunlight. I pressed my 
advantage.
"Sir, you are so ugly that in your youth your 
mother tied soup bones around your neck in vain 
hopes that at least the dogs would play with 
you."
The poor fellow broke down and slumped to 
the ground, his hands hiding his sobbing face. 
But wary of his past history I continued my re­
lentless attack.
"Sir, you are so ugly," I paused for inflection, 
"that you look like ground zero for a 7 megaton 
Ugly Bomb!"
That did it. His spirit was audibly broken and 
so I stepped forward to deliver the blow that 
would truly shatter him.
"Sir, your mother wears—"
Sunddenly a rumpled old woman waving a 
Union Jack, burst through the crowd of specta­
tors and plodded across the muddy field in what 
appeared on first inspection to be galoshes. She 
came to the disheveled figure prostrate on the 
grass.
"My poor boy, whut 'as 'e done to yew?!"
"Oh momsie, I wanted you to be so proud of__ _ Nme.
Being the thoughtful humanitarian I am and 
enamored of my own good health I decided to 
save the final blow for some future challenger to 
my retained world crown title.

George Musaka's literal mind refused to believe 
in the wall of fire described before him. "It has 
to be some sort of simulation" was the last thing 
he said before attempting to walk through. His 
ashes were scattered in the crackling fire next to 
Thomlinson.
Back in the forest they slept. All of them at 
once. When Estelle and Norman woke up 
Mathew was gone. There was no body. Just a 
stained carpet.*****
The game had lasted six hours when Norman 
was lured into a trap. The pit had opened up be­
neath him. A flickering light creature twinkled 
above him.
While trying to help Norman, Estelle offered 
to gamble with the creature for Norman's 
freedom. A contest of wills ensued. Each of the 
participants had to come up with a rhyming 
line of iambic pentameter.
Back and forth the poetic battle ragged be­
tween Thomlinson's imagination and hers.
"Throughout the night the...I can't think... 
wait a minute..."She drummed her fingers on the 
coffee table, over the chair cushions. Spider­
like she touseled her hair.

"I'm sorry Ms. Korman, but I'm afraid your 
character has lost its wager and has been possed 
by the demon. It was so nice having you."
Estelle Korman screamed and rushed head 
long at the window. It broke. She fell screaming 
to the concrete below. The spreading brain pool 
left little doubt about her condition.
"What is it you want Thomlinson!?"
Reilly Thomlinson got up and closed what was 
left of the window. He said only "I'll have to 
get it fixed in the morning."
*****
Norman's persona easily climbed out of the pit.

He just as easily got lost among the densely 
packed trees.
Half starved and two days without sleep his 
persona stumbled. From a tree 10 yards away an 
arrow flew. It pierced his stomach.
Coughing and screaming or. the floor Norman 
scrambled to Reilly's feet.
"Why? What gives you the power to do this?"
"The power Mr. Weiss is simple. All world's., 
including your real world, are products of m\ 
imagination. When I want to create a new one I 
test it with the best possible material from one of 
my already existing creations. It is such a waste 
of time to create a world with no challanges for 
its inhabitants." He bent down to take Norman's 
pulse. "It's a shame, Mr. Weiss, that you never 
asked for a map, it wouhd have saved you." 
Norman opened his mouth to answer, Reilly 
closed it saying, "Don't bother answering Mr. 
Weiss, I'm afraid you're dead."

In a florescently lit study on the first floor 
of the house Reilly Thomlinson sat down at his

he produced a cream colored em/filnnp Inside

ENTERTAINMENT
MAGIC
built the tension to an unbearable level 
and then released it in a single screeching 
riff.
And suddenly Mangione the instrumen­
talist was there.
The sensibility that has long been ev­
ident in Chuck Mangione’s compostions 
emerged throughout the next three pieces.
I began to think the high-flown hype com­
paring him to Bix and Dizzie and Lew So- 
loff was neither high-flown nor hype. Man­
gione has a style that captures the cerebral 
intensity of Miles Davis, and adds to it the 
visceral whimsy of Dizzie Gillespie, creat­
ing a sound that is new, exciting, and dif­
ferent. His phrasing is so simple and clean 
and relaxed that one is tempted to over­
look the fact that this is a rare and beau­
tiful quality, that ease of delivery is the
most elusive aspect of playing.
The excellence of the Mangione style 
became most apparent in the third piece, 
“The Eleventh Commandment,” which 
had a more traditional jazz framework 
and therefore showed the difference by 
comparison. Chris Vadals also had some 
fine moments here with a fluid and lyrical 
phrasing that showed him to be both a 
technical master and a sensitive soloist. 
Brant Geissman, the guitarist, finally 
emerged from behind technical riffing and 
contributed some very fine playing. Bass 
player Charles Meeks continued to be a 
solid, often compelling, presence upon 
which the entire delicate structure was 
built.
Then came the climax of the evening, as 
the last piece, “Land Of Make Believe” 
was begun. This is a tune I have had stuck 
in my head since the first time I heard it, 
and after the way it was performed on Fri­
day, I doubt that I will ever stop humming 
it. It was everything I had hoped, and 
more. It alternately glides and rips along, 
with the continual pulse of the bass behind 
it, into a setting that is muscial perfection 
for Mangione’s artistry on the flugelhom. 
It is tight, gripping, mellow, powerful-this 
is the real magic of Mangione. At the con­
clusion of this piece I was completely won 
over along with the rest of the audience, 
and surged hysterically to my feet with 
everyone else, demanding more.
Two encores followed, and I believe we 
would all be there still if Mangione had 
been able to keep playing. My only com­
plaint is that the entire evening was not as 
exciting as the second set.
MANGIONE: A SENSE OF
A Concert Review 
« Band: Chuck Mangione 
Producer: AB
by McKinley Sledge
If you were not in Carnegie Music 
Hall on Friday night, nothing I say can give 
you the sense of magic Chuck Mangione 
brings to his music. All I can tell you is 
$that there is something very different and 
special about the w^y Mangione hears 
music. He creates an extraordinarily mel­
low musical atmosphere which is symphon­
ic in its lyricism. Like the best orchestral 
music, it surrounds you with an acoustic 
presence. Mangione’s dynamic control is 
also more classical than jazz, one moment 
blasting, the next so soft you can hear the 
^ drummer breathe.
* All this takes a little getting used to. 
Mangione’s approach to the concert sit­
uation was also different enough to 
require some adjustment. As a performer 
he is not so much giving as he is simply 
present. Other bands and musicians try to 
hype or stampede the audience; Mangione 
persuades.
I was not persuaded until the second 
half of the concert. The first set of five 
pieces showed that the musicians were 
tired, perhaps a little ill (Mangione had lar­
yngitis) and a little uncomfortable in the 
luxurious forty-degree air-conditioned 
comfort of the hall. The five pieces were 
rigidly presented with very little improvi­
sation or sparkle, defeating what 1 believe 
to be one of the purposes of live per­
formance. I was intellectually interested, 
but not engaged.
Grant Geissman, the guitartist, did some 
technically interesting things, but re­
mained simply a technician, content with 
flashy mundane jazz licks. The rhythm 
section of Charles Meeks on bass and James 
Bradley, Jr. on drums was a very solid 
presence, but merely a backdrop. Chris 
> Valais became very popular with the audi­
ence after some slick riffs on sax and flute, 
and Mangione himself yawned at the piano 
between flights on his flugelhom. A mood 
of smooth whimsy radiated from the stage 
which left me relaxed, smiling, and unim­
pressed.
During the intermission I decided that 
here was a good musician who had dis*
, covered three or four very interesting and
Photos by Ramanan
very nice things about composition and 
jazz orchestration and used these tricks re­
peatedly. I chuckled at the comparisons 
between Mangione and Six Biederbecks' 
or Dizzy Gillespie. The first half of the 
concert was competent and smooth, but a 
little too slick and commercial. Very good, 
but not very exciting. This man, who wore 
a sweater with his own picture on die back, 
and whose father hawked souveniers in the 
lobby, had written some very pleasant 
tunes which he performed very pleasantly.
In a mood of pleasant reflection I re­
turned to my seat for the second half of 
the concert and was hammered through the 
floor. All my pleasant and condescending 
thought about Mangione and his music ex­
ploded in the first number, “The Legend 
of the One-eyed Sailor.” Janies “Jail- 
Bait” Bradley, Jr., the world’s youngest 
professional drummer, performed an elec­
trifying solo that left the audience stunned. 
He played in and out of time with such 
precise abandon, using every piece of 
metal, plastic, wood, or skin within his 
reach that his solo became a composition 
in its own right. Chris Vadals earned the 
popularity he had gained with the audience 
in the first half with an alto sax solo that

TRANSCENDING HOLLYWOOD SAGAS
A film review 
Film. You Light Up My Life 
Director: Joseph Brooks
by Carol Green /
The story of the little girl who wants to 
make it big in Hollywood is a story often 
told on the screen. You Light Up My Life 
is typical of the girl-who-takes-on- 
Hollywood sagas. You Light Up My Life 
occasionally transcends this tired cliche 
which prevents it from becoming another 
grade “B” script.
Laurie Robinson (Didi Cohn), is the 
central character. Laurie grows up with 
her father who is a night club comic. 
Laurie, is her father’s Frankenstein in that 
he tries to train Laurie to do a small comic 
act with a dummy which follows his act. 
As Laurie gets older, she continues doing 
the same routine, dressed in overalls, a 
checked shirt and pigtails, just as she did 
as a child. Cy, her father, still harps on the 
fact that her timing is off and if she 
worked at it, Laurie would get laughs.
Cy (Joe Silver), is not stereotyped into 
a stage father or a crazy entertainer. He is 
just a human being trying to raise a child 
the best way that he can. Putting Laurie 
on stage is a way to be closer to her. Cy 
drinks a bit too much when Laurie is 
young, but as time goes on, his clothes 
get better and he drinks less. Cy' is never 
able to provide his daughter with a perma­
nent home so, he compensates the de­
ficiency by throwing huge prewedding 
parties and plans an elaborate wedding 
ceremony.
Laurie wants desperately to be a singer 
and an actress. She wants to forget the 
nightclubs, the overalls and the dummy 
WHimytfWHmtHitHi
but she doesn’t want to hurt her father. 
This is where the Film’s believability starts 
to erode. The film weakens slightly as it 
begins to show commercial auditions 
where Laurie encounters various types to 
be found at such auditions.
Laurie meets a director in a restaurant 
with whom she falls for. They achieve ins­
tant intimacy, naturally, in the true cine- 
natic cliche tradition. This new love is
implicated by the fact that Laurie is 
getting married to another man in a few 
lays. The film ebbs and flows from here on 
as it stumbles through Laurie’s conflict 
with her two men.
Perhaps director, producer and song i 
writter Joseph Brooks was trying to 
create a kind of collage showing the life 
of an aspiring entertainer. The flaw in the 
picture is that some small events are 
dwelled on so much that they become a 
distraction. Brooks takes small things and 
blows them out of proportion.
These pieces of Laurie’s life are strung 
together with a lot of shots of her driving,r 
her car. If these sequences were cut from 
the film, the running time could be shor­
tened about 30 minutes.
As Laurie, Didi Cohn is reminiscent of 
Sandy Dennis, only more sincere. She finds 
reality in a script that is sometimes rooted 
in fantasy. Although a particular scene may 
not be believable in itself, Didi Cohn 
remains sincere and real.
Joe Silver is h:mest as Cy. Silver is for 
tunate in that all of his scenes have to do 
with relating to Laurie, or doing his club 
act. These scenes are simple and to the 
point, all except for his last scene.
In this scene, the moral which is that 
Laurie-has-to-take-care-of-herself is under­
lined to such an extent that it becomes 
insulting.
The ending, trite as it may be, is not 
typical of the entire movie. In some parts, 
You Light Up My Life is touching and 
real, despite what goes elsewhere in the 
movie. Though some scenes may not be 
consistently well done, much of You 
Light Up My Life has something to say to 
its audience.

"Was ist eine 'Peach Roll-up’?"
A dance review 
Company: Soviet Georgian Dancers 
Producer. Pittsburgh Dance Council
by Knox Uguccioni
A whirlwind of ethnic dance dazzled 
Pittsburghers as the Soviet Georgian Dan­
cers gave a truly virtuoso display of their 
native Georgian song and dance. Appear­
ing in Pittsburgh for the first time, this 
company of dancers, singers and musicians 
gave performances which spanned a wide 
range of song and dance, from simple shep­
herds songs to spectacular war dance. The 
singers, members of the all-male Tbilisi 
Polyphonic Choir, sang with remarkable a- 
bility and range. They also provided back­
ground songs for several of the dances.
The dances are traditions of Russian 
Georgia and the Caucasus and are based on 
two forms; the line and the circle. Intri­
cate variations can be produced within 
each form as well as by combining the two. 
The Mipatizheba is a line dance and it uses 
the formality of strong lines to produce an 
almost stylized court dance expressing the 
nobility of men and their respect of wo­
men. In the lines of men and women as 
well as the lines of couples there is a strong 
focus upon the developing relationships be­
tween the dancers.
On the other hand, the spirited holiday 
dance, Perkhuli, is a round dance with 
concentric rings of dancers. The women 
dance in a small circle in the center and the 
men dance around them. There may be 
interweaving and changing positions, but 
basically the men dance in larger circles a- 
round the women.
For the folk war dance, the men were 
divided into two lines of combatants. 
They danced en masse in mock battle but 
then paired off for more rigorous fighting. 
The steel swords they used were hardly 
fake and sparks flew when blades met. 
The dance was an intricate combination of 
dance and swordplay with many potential­
ly dangerous moments. A slight error in 
timing might have resulted in a bloody 
gash, but luckily there were no such prob­
lems.
Most of the dances were geared toward 
the men. They had the flashy, athletic 
movements and they are also the only men 
in the world to dance on pointe. Actually 
dancing on their toes and wearing soft 
leather boots with no padding, they have 
no support except their own strength. 
Many of the steps required jumping across 
the entire stage on pointe, a strenuous and 
most likely painful feat. Some of their 
other movements were equally as torturing. 
Imagine jumping high into the air, kicking 
the back of your head and then landing on 
your knee. Ouch! Each of these feats is 
a display of strength, virility and endurance 
as well as proficient technical dancing.
The climax of the performance was 
Salkhino, an exciting blend of music, song 
and dance. It’s many variations of the line 
and circle produced intricate patterns of 
singers and dancers. As the dance pro­
gressed, each dancer was given the chance 
to do what he did best and the steps and 
jumps became more complicated and more 
spectacular as each tried to outdo those 
before him.
A perfectly marvelous evening climaxed 
with a glorious blend of singers and dancers 
exhibiting the exhuberance and vitality 
which make native ethnic dances such an 
important and revered part of many cul­
tures.

DISCO: FORM FOLLOWS FUNCTION
A music commentary
by David C. Lucas
Disco music is often regarded with 
much disdain by “serious” music-listeners. 
What these folks fail to recognize is that in 
this case, “form follows function.” The 
function of disco is to provide music for 
dancing. The driving dance beat is the basic 
element. Tune, instrumentation, vocals 
and lyrics occur later (if at all). Fortu­
nately, some disco evolves into music that 
can be appreciated for those latter items. 
This review concerns itself with that music.
Since disco cuts often comprise a whole 
side of an album or appear only on 12 inch 
“disco-mix” records, this review will cover 
seperate tunes instead of albums. The fol­
lowing tunes can probably be heard in any 
grass-roots discotheque. Here, then, are 
selections from the Fall ’77 Disco Line-Up:
1. Do You Want To Get Funky With Me? 
(Peter Brown 8:30 TK Disco 12 inch 45). 
Diabolically delicious. The vocalist who 
sounds like he’s in the deranged blush of 
young adulthood, describes his encounter 
with a temptress from Hades. The backup 
vocals by girl-group Wildflower range from 
cute hoots to breathy hisses. Timbalines, 
jingle bells and Wildflower’s erotic line: 
“It’s so hot, I’m burning up,” build to the 
frenetic finale, when the guy succumbs to
the allures of the she-devil. Imaginative vo­
cal interplay, catchy lyrics and instrument­
al variety make this a prime example of 
good disco.
2. Twen ty Four Hours a Day
(Barbara Pennington 9:22; United Artists
Disco 33 rpm).
It is jokingly referred to as “Love 
Theme From the Purina Cat Chow Orches­
tra ” because of its mewling violins and cat­
erwauling clarinet. Twenty Four Hours a 
Day was almost disco-mixed into oblivion. 
It builds slowly with a gently throbbing 
piano and bass combo, then adds on a gi­
gantic orchestra and a chorus. Pennington 
has the vocal punch of a Chaka Kahn and 
her backup vocalists add just the right 
touch. The middle of the cut gives a couple 
minutes too much of the piano, bass, and 
violin “mews”, but on the dance floor 
where time and space are a function of the
sound and light systems, the length goes
unnoticed. Pennington swings back into a 
couple more verses before your nine min­
utes are up.
3. I Remember Yesterday/Love’s Unkind/ 
Back in Love Again 16:05 and I Feel Love 
5:33
(Donna Summer, Casablanca Album).
The “First Lady of Love” departs from 
the Orgiastic mold in the medley which 
covers a side of her fourth album. I Re­
member Yesterday owes a lot to Doctor 
Buzzard’s Savannah Band in its nostalgic 
recreation of the Prohibition Sound. Ban­
jos; spoons, creamy brass and the smooth 
baritones of The Brooklyn Dreams give 
this tune a listenable quality uncharacter­
istic of disco. Donna cops some “voh-de- 
oh-dos”, then slams into the Phil-Spector- 
esque delight, Love’s Unkind. These lyrics 
are high-school, and the lady’s lazy mono­
logue is a knock-out. The throaty sax, 
handclaps and castanets cap it all off. Back 
in Love Again is supremes-’64 all the way 
and slides into a reprise of I Remember 
Yesterday.
1 Feel Love is a tour de torce of synthe­
sizers and sighs. On a good stereo system, 
it bounces heads around like ping pong 
balls. A cross-over to the TOP 40 charts. 
Likely to be spun several times in tandem 
by a good disco deejay.
4. Magic Fly
(Kebekelekerik 6:39 TK Disco 45)
The better of two versions of this “art 
rock” disco tune. Primaeval drums intro­
duce the low-key, high-volume mellotroa 
and synthesizer body of the number. Max­
imal disco from interwoven layers of mini­
mal music which really blows you away.
5. I Found Love (Now That Vve Found 
You)
(Love & Kisses, 16:14 Casablanca Album 
Love & Kisses)
Begins with piano, kettle drum-beats 
(which sound like the Concorde landing at 
Pittsburgh International) and harp-strum­
ming. Girl singers in wild abandon 
perform backup for Alec R. Costandinos. 
a Barry Manilow in an echo chamber. 
Orchestration approaches disco-self-parody 
in its use of nifty musical hooks. A few 
minutes of tango here, a handclap interlude 
there. After 15 minutes it fades out, but a 
voice growls “And you thought it was all 
over...no, no, no, no...” and starts the tune 
over again. Recorded in London, registered 
in France and inspired by Munich.
6. Village People Medley: San Francisco 
(You’ve Got me)/ In Hollywood (Every­
body is a Star) 10:40 and Fire Island 
5:49 Coasablanca Album Village People.
Heavy doses of The Sound of Philadel­
phia. At least one of every musical instru­
ment known to man is used here. Victor 
Willis’ lead vocal sizzles, as do those of the 
strong and very male backup singers. The 
band is dressed in coats & tails or leather, 
as cowboys and Indians or construotio» 
workers. The Medley is a California travel­
ogue set to fun . The chorus of Fire ldantL, 
“Don’t go in the bushes, something might 
grab ya” is destined for immortality. All J 
tunes have grinding rhythm tracks, a« 
magnificently orchestrated and expouse ¦ 
hedonistic gay lifestyle. At 11 minutes par 
side, it could be the shortest album in 
music history.

THE MANITOU: MORE DEMONOLOGY
A book review 
Book: The Manitou 
Author: Graham Masterton 
Publisher. Pinnacle Books 
by Joan Livitski
When a novel uses an introduction to 
pat itself on the back, I balk. All it sug­
gests is how the rest of the book will 
develop: slowly. Mr. Hurwood, w’uo
writes the introduction, doesn’t want to 
“diminish the plot’s shock value.” so he 
ends up saying very little. Because of this 
fear of letting the cat out of the bag, the 
one interesting detail gets slurred over. 
Factual basis is given to the fiction which 
would make a poignant impression if only 
elaborated on.
In much the same suspenseful tactic, 
Mr. Materton holds back as much as pos­
sible for as long as possible. He wants the 
reader to use his imagination, but gives him 
too little to work with. So while the read­
er is grasping for the substance of the 
story, he comes back with only ambiguity.
Open the book and you see the word 
“possessed.” Read on and Masterton re­
fers to the Exorcist. But in fact, he dis­
counts that this is just another book on 
Demonology. What it actually is, is hard to 
say. Exorcism is denied. But what else 
is it when incantations are used to rid 
society of a manitou, (spirit)?
The author is up front about the story 
being supernatural in nature. It would be 
hard to deny seeing that you’re dealing 
with the reincarnation of a 300 year old 
American Indian Medicine Man called Mis- 
quamacus. He ente s our world through a 
tumor gro-.. th on a young girl’s neck that 
turns out to have fetus "l'e qualities. No 
less than a full grown man emerges.
Yet Masterton places his emphasis on ere 
ating sensationalism, as though he initially 
had hopes of making it into a film. There 
are obvious characteristics of occult mov­
ies, yet also exploited is the attraction of 
disaster films. People are entraped in a
hospital with no means of escape nor res­
cue. The difference is that instead of the 
usual elements for conflict (fire, flood, 
freak accident), the people are pitted again­
st an unknown element.
But to make it a film means sacrificing 
what works best: the creation of vivid
mental images. Even though Masterton 
blunders a potentially intriguing story­
line, he succeeds at drawing pictures with 
words having more emotional impact than
any concrete picture might have, wnereas 
his sketchiness resulted in ambiguity at the.
onset, once he starts dealing with the In­
dian Demons, his suggestive writing serves 
as a catalyst for contemplation. It’s admir­
able the amount of self-control he executes 
so as to convey enough to trigger the read­
er’s mind without being insulting.
The book does have its problems. It 
relys on stereotypes and overused conflicts. 
The clairvoyant, whose power is correctly 
typified by his Green Bay Packer’s cap, is 
the good-guy cowboy having a metaphori­
cal shoot-out with the savage Red Skin. 
Once again, history repeats itself when 
white man’s technology vs. Indian folk­
lore with the expected outcome.
Masterton disappoints me by not fully 
doing hs job. Instead of using his craft 
to create a sense of fear, he takes the easy 
route of telling you Erskine, the clairvoy­
ant is afraid so you should be too. But in 
other passages he strikes me as having put 
a great deal of thought into his writing. He 
attempts to cover all possibilities in answer­
ing questions and the result is a well 
thought-out plan of action. There are 
times though when after having committed 
himself, he doesn’t follow through with 
making the most of his choice.
If you’re looking for a book with an in­
tricately woven and developed plot, Man­
itou most likely won’t satisfy you. But if 
Vou need a diversion or like the stimulus of 
unusual images, Masterton’s book will 
most likely appeal to you. Maybe it should 
be considered as a text for computer 
courses. Then when programs don’t work, 
students can utilize Erskine’s technique in 
calling upon the computer’s manitou for

The Forbes Street Gallery is unique in 
being entirely student-managed. While this 
may not seem particularly significant at 
first, it is important to anyone at all inter­
ested in art exhibition or management. Not 
only does the Gallery provide all CMU stu­
dents, regardless of class or major, to ex­
hibit and possibly sell some of their work; 
it also allows students to gain first-hand 
experience in gallery management. In fact, 
without the student managers, attendants, 
and volunteers in public relations and oper­
ations, the Gallery could not function. • 
The Gallery is open from 12:00 to 4:00 
Tuesday through Sunday and from 7:00 to 
9:00 Wednesday and Thursday evenings. 
In addition, Tuesday nights are Grand 
Opening Nights, which include refresh­
ments, entertainment (sometimes), and a 
chance to meet that week’s artists.
From 7:00 to 9:30 tonight everyone is 
welcome to celebrate the opening of a spe­
cial two-week Crafts and Printmaking Ex­
hibit. Flute and guitar entertainment will
be provided by Mike Weiss, Jay Work, and 
Mark Carlotto.
If nothing else, a visit to the Gallery will 
expose you to the art of Carnegie-Mellon 
students. While you’re there, you might or­
der one of the attractive new T-shirts with 
the distinctive Gallery logo. Our guestbook 
is open to all for suggestions and criticisms, 
as well as for the development of a mailing 
list.
If you have any interest in Gallery pro­
ductions, either as an exhibitor or in man­
agement, it isn’t too late to become in­
volved. While much of the schedule is al­
ready filled, it is possible to have your 
work included in one of the many large 
group shows, like photography, theatre, 
architecture, or Freshman/Sophomore. An­
other alternative might be to have your 
own show in the “Gallery Plus” auxiliary 
exhibit area, located within the Gallery. 
Gallery attendants and any other type of 
volunteers are always needed and welcome. 
Talk to someone when you visit the Gal­
lery or leave a note at the Skibo Informa­
tion Desk.
Computer professionals are aware that 
today’s most advanced large-system 
technology was developed by a company 
that, not too long ago, was virtually 
unknown. It was during late 1975— 
when Amdahl delivered its first multi- 
million-dollar 470V/6 system follow­
ing a 5-year, $50,000,000 effort—that 
the company first attracted wide­
spread industry attention. Now, Amdahl 
is the most talked about company in 
the industry: a compact group of highly 
talented high technologists producing 
the world’s highest performing general 
purpose computers, the V/5, V/6 and 
V/7. Over a quarter billion dollars 
worth of Amdahl systems is now 
working worldwide in every industry 
sector using large-scale computers.
The original design team is still vir­
tually intact and working on future 
systems. Although we are growing at
an extremely rapid pace, we are com­
mitted to retaining the same creative 
environment that yielded the V/5, V/6 
and V/7. We are still small by com­
puter industry comparisons. We are 
still friendly. We still enjoy attacking 
tasks because we think it’s fun. And 
we still reward personal efforts with 
personal recognition.
We think Amdahl is a great place 
to work. There’s still room on the 
ground floor for you if you are about 
to receive a BS or advanced degree 
in electrical engineering or computer 
sciences, and consider yourself a cut 
above your classmates in competence, 
enthusiasm and potential.

DATE'-TUES 10-18 
TIME*-3:30pm
by Dave Wills
Washington and Jefferson's hopes of a 
conference title were rudely shattered by 
Carnegie-Mellon as the Tartans turned what 
was supposed to be a close game into the 
second rout in two weeks. The Tartans 
surpassed their average of 443 yards in 
total offense, piling up 460 total yards 
despite the rain and cold. Meanwhile, the 
Tartan defense held th« Presidents to 27 
yards rushing and 135 yards overall, most 
of them coming on a 54 yard pass from 
Jim Argenti to Dave Ross on the last play 
of the game. The shutout was CMU’s first 
this year.
11, Kennedy had Tony Digoia alone near 
the end zone, but a W&J defender tipped 
the ball out of his hands. Kennedy ran for 
7 yards on fourth down but it wasn’t 
enough and the Presidents took over on 
their 15 yard line. Rick Arturo and Mike 
Jochman sacked W&J's quarterback for a 
loss of ten yards, and Don Stoebe stopped 
Jeff Recker on a sweep for a loss of a yard. 
The Presidents couldn’t move the bail out 
of their side of the field, and after Tac 
Caine broke up a long pass, CMU got the 
ball on their 30 yard line.
Successive runs by Gary Bonn and 
Leaman moved the ball to the 47; then

It look Carnegie-Mellon exactly 9 sec­

Kostic kicked off to W&J’s Drew Zimmer­
man, who let the wet ball slide through his 
fingers into the end zone, where the Tar­
tan’s John Briceland recovered for the 
touchdown. Kostic’s P.A.T. was good and 
the Tartans never looked back.

ball back on their own 45 yard line. After

Rick Brown connected with Craig Hladik 
on a 20 yard pass. One play later Bonn 
broke to the outside, carrying the ball 24 
yards to the eight yard line. It took CMU 
three plays to score, with Bonn going over 
from the two to make the score 14-0.
Three W&J offensive plays netted 1 
yard, and CMU was on offense again. 
Brown passed to Digoia for 15 yards, with 
Digoia making a fine catch, and then Gary 
Bonn carried twice, each for a 10 yard 
gain. With the ball on the 10, the Tartans 
went to their T offense, and with Bonn 
carrying on all four plays, scored their 
third touchdown of the game. Kostic’s 
P.A.T. was good, making the score 21-0 at 
the half.
Rick Brown indicates that fullback Bonn has just scored.
The defense made a big play to open the 
second half, as Rick Arturo recovered a 
President fumble at the W&J 24 yard line. 
After two plunges into the middle, Bob 
Kennedy turned the veer option into a 17 
yard touchdown run. The P.A.T. put the 
Tartans on top, 28-0.
One of W&J’s few completed passes 
turned into disaster as Stoebe hit Dan 
Toderowski and recovered his fumble on
W&J’s 34 yard line. Kennedy didn’t waste 
any time as he passed to Jim Starr for a 24 
yard gain. W&J was caught offsides, mov­
ing the ball to the four, from where Bonn 
scored his third touchdown.
Again W&J couldn’t come up with a 
first down, as Mike Fausti threw Yongling

NE I I ERS SEMI-SUCCESSFUL Intramurals
by Bob Firm
Carnegie-Mellon’s tennis teams both en­
joyed some success this past week as the 
women defeated Duquesne 3-2 in an ex­
citing contest before losing to Robert 
Morris 3-2 and the men bombers held on to 
^own Robert Morris 5-4. The girls of 
Coach Peggy Russell now stand 3-2 for the 
year and 2-1 in conference play. Coach 
Russell’s men evened their record at 1-1.
Diana Hulik and Joan Andrews won a 
pressured packed doubles match in three
sets to nail down the victory for the Tar­
tans against Duquesne. The match was tied 
at 2 all before the improving doubles 
players entered the third set. The Hulik- 
Andrews combination triumphed in the 
deciding set, 6-3.
Denise Ryan continued to be strong in 
singles for CMU. She ran her individual 
record to a perfect 5-0 mark by winning 
matches against both opponents.
The women are on the road today to 
face Geneva and return home for a match 
against neighboring Chatham.
CMU’s men’s tennis squad used excel­
lent singles play to key them to the vic­
tory over Robert Morris. Sophomore John 
Sze and Mike Straub continued their fine 
play in winning their singles matches. 
Gary Kenieny and Dave Kirby also won in 
singles.
Kirby and Brian Wolf teamed in doubles 
to clinch what proved to be the winning 
match.
The men continue their fall schedule 
with an away match Saturday against the 
always powerful California State Vulcans.
The CMU cheerleaders in their homecoming garb entertained the large crowd who braved the foul weather.

your own team, thus advancing it up the 
field. The person with the Frisbee cannot 
run with it, he must plant one foot upon 
which he is allowed to pivot (like in basket­
ball). There are seven players to a team, 
and, unlike quite a few intercollegiate 
sports, a player’s sex is neither a help nor 
a hindrance. A knowledge of your team 
and the game are the most important 
marks of a good Ultimate player.
Practices of the CMU Frisbee team are 
being held Monday through Thursday from 
9:00 to 11:00 in the gym (PM, that is), 
and 10:00 AM to whenever on the Cut on 
Saturday and Sunday mornings. Practices 
are very informal and anyone interested 
is welcome to come.
As 1 mentioned before, this is an inter­
collegiate sport. Although not quite as 
formal or as high budgeted as the other 
sports, the Frisbee team does have a rea­
sonable schedule lined up. The second 
meet, is with Wainsberg and Penn State 
on October 15. This meet is home and 
will probably be played on the l.M. field. 
Spectators are welcome, so p»ck some 
food and make a party out of it.
If you have any wish at all to join, or 
even curiousity to see what it’s all about, 
start throwing a Frisbee around the cut 
during the day. and chances are that a 
member of the team will pop out of the 
woodwork to say “Hello.” If one doesn’t 
show up. try again later. It’s free.

BOOTERS DROP YET ANOTHER PAIR
by Johann Cruyff
The Carnegie-Mellon soccer team, in a 
continuing struggle to score some goals, 
dropped two decisions to opponents this 
past week. The killing blow came on Fri­
day, with a loss to Bethany, which all but 
decided the outcome in the P.A.C. soccer 
race.
On Tuesday an enthusiastic squad tra­
veled to Pitt-Johnstown eager to take ad­
vantage of the lull in their tough opening 
schedule. From the opening kickoff 
(which belonged to CMU) the Tartans 
continued to bombard Pitt’s goal. Captain 
Keith Hordatt had many an excellent op­
portunity only to hit a post or shoot just 
wide. As has been consistent with CMU 
defeats this season, the opponent scored 
first. Pitt’s Captain Tim Nolen, the fourth 
leading scorer in the West Penn Conference 
did it on a busted play and its after effect 
had a direct bearing on the outcome.
Fullback Tom Binnie in an effort to sol­
idify the defense through verbal communi­
cation only succeeded in trying to motivate 
his players by cajoling them. In turn the 
whole defensive unit felt pressured and as a 
result an only obvious second breakdown 
occured with Pitt capitalizing immediately 
and upping the count to 2-0. The half 
ended uneventful and after a scorching 
tongue lashing by Coach Gene Klein the 
Tartans came out for the second half.
In an amazing display of all out effort 
the Tartans ran for a solid 40 minutes 
never giving up on a ball in possesion of the 
other team. The passing was sharp. The 
movement fluid, the defense hard and pun­
ishing and finally the long awaited break 
came about. With the sun bursting through 
a low ceiling of clouds freshman Colin 
Clement scored CMU’s second goal of the 
season off a feed from Hordatt and the 
tired Tartans had 19 minutes of game time 
remaining. It was 9 minutes later on a long 
crossfield kick from the fullback line that 
Clement took it in on goal and after a col­
lision with Pitt defense, junior Pat Crump 
jumped on the loose ball and smashed it 
home from 10 yards out.
The CMU squad let up defensively and 
through sheer exhaustion played a frantic 
game of booting the ball during the final 
five minutes of regulation time. The horn 
sounded with Pitt on offense and after a 
brief pow wow between the opposing 
coaches it was decided that two ten minute 
overtime periods were in order.
Six minutes into the first overtime per­
iod it was Nolen again who scored on yet 
another breakdown. Pitt went into a def­
ensive shell and the contest ended with 
Johnstwon on the long end of a 3-2 dec­
ision.
On Friday the situation was different
and CMU knew they would have to be at 
their best to even stay afloat against the 
squad from Bethany College. The game 
started with the young Tech squad attack­
ing the Bison goal. It took Bethany about
15 minutes to get organized and at that 
time a beautiful drop head to the right 
wing crashing in from the outside was the 
set up for a shot which beat helpless goalie 
John Hawkins to his left. The Bisons came 
back just twenty minutes later and on an 
outside cross with a resultant collision bet­
ween Hawkins and Bethany’s John Shol- 
head the ball found the corner of the net 
and Bethany took a 2-0 halftime lead.
The second half saw CMU once again 
regroup to perform some excellent passing 
and offensive attacks only to lack a suffi­
cient finish which would result in a goal. 
The Bethany squad, which had scored 22
goals in its previous 3 games, could muster 
only one other tally on another CMU men­
tal error and the game ended 3-0. CMU 
now faces the easy half of its schedule with 
the majority of the action being played 
away form home. The final home game for 
the booters will be a week from today, 
against non-league opponent St. Vincent.

continued from page twenty four
illegal receiver downfield, Kennedy hit 
Hladik for 34 yards, getting a great block 
by Leaman to spring Hladik loose. A per­
sonal foul moved the ball further still, 
down to W&J’s 21 yard line. After 
Leaman ran for 6, Bonn followed Pete 
| Rothermel off the left side for Bonn’s 
fourth touchdown of the game, making the 
score 42-0 with 4:11 left in the third
quarter.
The remainder of the game saw whole­
sale substitutions for CMU, some of whom 
weren’t even listed on the program. The 
action slowed down considerably as 16 
penalties were called during this period, 
many of them personal fouls from the 
frustrated W&J players.
The capacity homecoming crowd was 
treated to one more display of offense as 
Keith Bille passed to Gene Marcink for 29
yards* then ran the final 8 yards for a 
touchdown himself. Kostic’s seventh 
P.A.T. of the game made the score 49-0.
The defense came up with a total of 
three fumble recoveries along with 2 
interception« by Greg Gailey, the most 
impressive showing to date. Matt Wehrle 
only punted twice but both helped keep 
W&J deep in their own territory. A def­
ender who didn’t even dress received the 
game ball, as the Tartans voted to give it to
Rich Lackner. Lackner, who broke a bone 
in his back against Oberlin, will be able to 
play when the pain subsides.
The Tartans will travel to Cleveland Sat­
urday, all alone on top the PAC, as they 
meet John Carroll, and then CMU will host 
the Allegheny Gators on Oct. 22 for the 
PAC championship. Sparky is going bald.
SAE Shuts 
ATO Out
by Joseph Kozak
In a game that left everyone wondering 
what had happened, SAE shocked ATO 
6-0. It was SAE’s first victory of the sea­
son and left ATO showing two losses.
As a matter of fact, because of SAE’s 
inept showing against PIKA and a hum­
orous loss to C-Map-A, and ATO’s man­
handling of Beta and PIKA plus a close 
contest against the All-Stars, the SAE-ATO 
matchup took on the cataclysmic propor­
tions of a battle between the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers and the Pittsburgh Steelers.
SAE received the opening kickoff and 
revealed a revamped offense with AL Foun­
tain at quarterback and Jim Schiffman 
moved to end. Suddenly, two completions 
to Schiffman and center Pickering and SAE 
was on the ATO ten. But, on the next 
play, Gatehouse of ATO picked off the 
pass in the endzone to prevent a touch­
down. for a ii.nuent, might iiavt 
noticed that SAE moved the ball fairly 
easily, but Gatehouse’s interception re­
asserted ATO’s strength.
ATO took posession with Pete Anti- 
marino at QB and Gatehouse and Billy 
Miller at ends. ATO moved the ball, but 
not far enough to score, and SAE took 
over again. Again SAE rolled forward 
quickly and again Gatehouse intercepted in 
his own endzone. On the next series, ATO 
wound up punting, something no one rem­
embers seeing them do at any time this 
season.
After a couple more SAE drives, an­
other Gatehouse interception, and superb 
defense by SAE’s Dan McGrath and Terry 
Hanna, it was suddenly halftime and the 
score was 0-0. SAE was shutting out the 
highest scoring offense in the league. 
Everyone realized that they were watching 
one helluva game.
The SAE defense continued to shut off 
the ATO scoring combo of Antimarino and 
Gatehouse by getting to Antimarino. The 
strong SAE rush by Jeff Ball and Jim Tri- 
thart sacked Pete several times in crucial 
situations. Linebacker Greg Kaminsky 
caught Antimarino five yards short of a 
TD when it looked impossible for ATO not 
to score.
Gatehouse traded interceptions with 
McGrath to stop respective drives, but it 
was Schiffman’s pickoff within the ATO 
twenty that set up the SAE touchdown. 
Fountain nailed Pickering in the endzone 
for six and threw the extra point to Gate­
house.
The remainder of the game was pretty 
much the same, ATO moving the ball only 
to get snuffed when they needed to score. 
SAE ran out the clock with one minute 
left, capturing a most pleasing victory.^ 
ATO wandered off wondering what had 
happened.
In other IM action, undefeated Coaches 
All-Stars chomped on PIKA 39-19, Boron 
finding Scattaregia three times, Big Schiff­
man twice, and John Molinda once. 
PIKA’s most impressive scoring play came 
to big Griff, Paul Minor. The game was 
dominated by the All-Stars as they led 
20-0 at the half.
