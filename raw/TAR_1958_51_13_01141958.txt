Totals 7 Million
The leadership gifts phase of 
the alumni campaign is in its final 
stages. To date $500,000 of the 
$1,500,000 goal has been raised. A 
new total in the overall $24,350,- 
000 campaign of $7,351,057 over 
last month’s $6,735,506 has re­
cently been disclosed.
The campaign is now being ex­
panded to cover philanthropic 
foundations and non-alumni who 
are in a financial position to sup­
port Tech’s program.
In the construction line, plans 
are underway for breaking ground 
for the campus activities center 
and possibly the library.
Non-Citizens
All students who are not 
citizens of the United States 
are required by the Immigra­
tion and Naturalization Act to 
submit their annual address 
report to any post office or 
Immigration and Naturaliza­
tion Service Office between 
January 1 and January 31. 
The forms for submitting the 
report may be obtained from 
Miss Klawinski in AH 150.
Braithwaite 
To Lecture
The distinguished British phil­
osopher R. B. Braithwaite will visit 
the campus on Thursday, Janu­
ary 16, to present a public lecture 
on the subject of “Scientific Ex­
planation.”
The lecture is based on his book 
of the same title, which examines 
in non-technical terms the logical 
procedures which are common to 
all fields of science. Braithwaite 
explains that all educated persons 
are aware of the general way in 
which are deduced particular con­
sequences to be tested by observ­
ation and experiment—but that 
they' often are confused by many 
of the seemingly mysterious fea­
tures of this procedure, such as 
the functions of mathematics and 
of probability and the nature of 
theoretical concepts.
Leading Intellect
The “mystery features” func­
tion as the links which make the 
higher levels of examination pos­
sible by binding them logically to 
the observable lower levels.
Professor Braithwaite is one of 
the foremost experts on the logi­
cal bases of scientific procedure, 
and is an important intellectual 
figure in both the United States 
and Great Britain. He is Knight- 
bridge Professor of Moral Philos­
ophy at the University of Cam­
bridge, England.
“Scientific Explanation” will be 
presented in the auditorium of 
the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration at eight p.m.
Congress Debating 
NewCommencement
Controversial Argument Arises
The recent announcement of the new commencement 
program has aroused one of the most controversial argu­
ments in Student Congress this year. Carolou Fidder pre­
sented a motion that Congress strongly disapprove of the 
' ?new plan.
Miss Fidder objected to the part 
of the program that would require 
the graduates to split up into their 
various colleges to receive their 
degrees, rather than one general 
commencement. She said, “People 
are always demanding that the col­
leges be integrated. Here is our 
one chance to act as the class of 
1958. We have always been de­
partmentalized in the past, and 
now they want to departmentalize 
graduation too.”
Selfish Administration 
Another objection raised by 
members of Congress is based on 
the fact that the students were 
not consulted in the matter. Lou 
Marquet stated that “The admin­
istration is being selfish in approv­
ing this new plan. It will enabis 
them tti g^t big name spe^ikers, 
and get the school’s name in all 
the papers. But graduation should 
be for the students, so give it back 
to them.”
Other Side
On the other hand, it was 
brought out that the old type cere­
mony, which took place in the 
Mosque, required everyone to sit 
in unbearable heat while the en­
tire graduating class paraded by. 
As Rody Stephenson said, “I 
don’t want to< sit for two hours 
watching strangers parading by.” 
And Pete Pence said, “Our parents 
don’t want to watch a herd of 
étrangers trample across the 
stage,” they want to see their own 
son or daughter, and no one else.” 
The motion was tabled for two 
weeks, so that the representatives 
could get opinions from their con­
stituency. All organizations are 
asked to discuss the matter and 
instruct their representatives on 
how to vote.

Tech Swimming Team Edges 
Slippery Rock STC 11-12
Tech’s swimming team showed 
tremendous depth in edging Slip­
pery Rock STC, 44-42. A fresh- 
r^n dominated medley relay lost 
to the referees in the opening 
went as one member failed to 
touch on a turn. Behind seven 
points, Tech’s Pat Crecine closed 
the gap with a decisive victory in 
the 200 freestyle. The next Tech 
victory came in the 200 butterfly, 
as freshman Dick Line won with 
ease. Captain Mike Litch followed 
wjth a victory in the 100 free­
style. Tech continued to peck 
away at Slippery Rock’s lead as 
Ross Engleman won the 440 free­
style.
Going into the final relay, Tech 
was still behind by five points. Pat 
Crecine swam the first 100 in 56 
seconds and gave teammates 
Engleman, Barlow, and Litch a 
lead which Slippery Rock was un­
able to gain on and Tech was vic­
arious in their second meet.
One of Tech’s stand outs, not 
only in this meet but throughout 
the season, is Ross Engleman, a 
junior M.E. from Brackenridge, 
Pa. Last year’s tri-state champion 
in the 440 freestyle, Ross has
gained three firsts in the first two 
meets so far this season.

Bowling Continues 
As SN Sets Two 
All-time Records
New records again highlighted 
the action in IM bowling last Sat­
urday. Sigma Nu again ran wild 
m setting two more all-time Tech 
records, an amazing 2510 team 
series, and a 944 team game. Ed 
McEwen of ATO bowled three 
outstanding games to set a sea­
son’s high series mark of 567.
SN-A’s Jim Swisher contributed 
the season’s’ high game of 219. 
SAE established itself as the Tar­
tan League spoilers by defeating 
ATO in one game. Fifth in the 
league, SAE is the only team to 
take a game from both ATO and 
SN-A, now tied for the league 
lead. SN-B is the Kiltie League 
leader.

A Campus-to-Career Case History
John Reiter (right) discusses the route of signals from the 
wave guide through the IF stages of a microwave receiver.
“This was the kind of challenge I was looking for”
(I
Here’s what John A. Reiter, Jr., B.S. 
in Electronics, Arizona State College, 
’54, says about the biggest project so far 
in his Bell System career.
“This was the kind of challenge I was 
looking for—a chance to assist in plan­
ning a microwave radio relay system 
between Phoenix and Flagstaff, Arizona. 
Five intermediate relay stations would be 
needed, and I began by planning the 
tower locations on ‘line of sight’ paths 
after a study of topographical maps. 
Then I made field studies using altimeter 
measurements, and conducted path-loss 
tests to determine how high each tower 
should be. This was the trickiest part of 
the job. It called for detecting the pres­
ence of reflecting surfaces along the
transmission route, and determining 
measures necessary to avoid their effects.
“Not the least part of the job was 
estimating the cost of each of the five 
relay stations. All told, the system will 
cost more than $500,000. When con­
struction is finished in December of this 
year, Til be responsible for technical 
considerations in connecting the radio 
relay and telephone carrier equipment.
“This assignment is an example of the 
challenges a technical man can find in 
the telephone company. You take the j ob 
from start to finish—from basic field 
studies to the final adjustments—with 
full responsibility. To technical men who 
want to get ahead, that’s the ultimate 
in responsibility.”

SAE’s Win 
IM LBETPvball
On the last Monday night be­
fore the Christmas vacation, the 
SAE’s defeated the ATO’s in the 
finals of the volleyball tourna­
ment, and won the intramural 
championship for another year. 
Both teams had a large number of 
supporters among the fans, and 
cheering was intense throughout 
the game.
In the first game, the SAE’s 
jumped to a quick 5-1 lead after 
losing the first point to ATO’s 
The SAE’s kept a safe lead for 
the remained of the game, win­
ning by a score of 15-5. The suc­
cess of the SAE’s was largely due 
to good team play, while poor ball 
handling cost the ATO’s several 
points.
The second game started off as 
the first had, with the ATO’s tak­
ing the first point and the SAE’s 
taking a 5-1 lead. ATO’s rallied 
to tie the game at 10-10. The rest 
of the game was hard fought, but 
ATO’s pulled out to a 15-11 vic­
tory.
In the third game, the SAE’s 
again plilled out to an early lead. 
The score was 10-2 before the 
ATO's could catch their breath. 
ATO ¿hen brought the score up to 
12-7, but were unable to narrow 
the gap any more. The SAE’s won 
the game, and the championship 
with it, 15-7.
George Thomas 
Named MVP
George Thomas, dependable 
SAE setter, was named as this 
year’s most valuable player in IM 
volleyball.
Thomas captained his team to 
the championship and not only 
was a consistent player, but also a 
team leader.
George played volleyball at 
Peabody High and his freshman 
year played on the ball team 
which was the Eastern IM Cham­
pionships and was runner up in 
Eastern Intercollegiate Varsity 
championship.
Thomas was named to the sec­
ond All-Eastern team. He also 
played two years when he was in 
the army.
All School IM 
VB Team
This year’s IM all school vol­
leyball team was composed of two 
“setters” and four “spikers.” Nam­
ed to the dream team were George 
Thomas, SAE; Ed Kung, Grad Ig- 
gles; Tom Bieg, ATO; Dick Aust, 
SAE; Bob Rieber, SAE; and Lou 
Montini, KS.
Reber and Aust helped spike 
the SAE’s to a championship this 
year while they were being set for

ATO Edges SN 
3-2 To Win IM 
Water Polo Title
Alpha Tau Omega defeated 
Sigma Nu, 3-2, on December 16, 
to win the water polo title.
In a spirited game, punctuated 
with disputed referee calls, the 
two teams were never separated 
by more than one goal, and all 
the scoring was done in the first 
and third quarters.
Bob Shuck started the scoring 
for ATO in the first period, but 
Sigma Nu’s Joe Venti quickly 
knotted the score, with a shot 
that bounced off the goal frame. 
Both goalees stopped repeated 
goal attempts in the scoreless sec­
ond three-minute period.
ATO’s Jack Billy opened the 
second half scoring with a hard 
shot that SN goalee Joe Garrett 
couldn’t stop; and SN once again 
fought back with a goal fired by 
John Bergren. Just before the 
period ended, ATO’s Bob Shuck 
again tallied to make the score 
3-2. There was little offensive 
action in the last period, as ATO 
goalie Ken Wilkens controlled the 
ball through most of the quarter 
while the teams repeatedly jock­
eyed for position.
by the years’ MVP George Thomas 
(see article). ' Both hit hard, 
smashing spikes and were consist­
ent in leading their team to a 
championship.
Kung was the star setter for 
the powerful Grad Iggles. He was 
a good team player and knows his 
way around on the volleyball 
court. Bieg helped bring a strong 
ATO team to the finals with his 
driving spikes and probably the 
hardest spike to return in the IM 
leagues.
Montini was a mainstay on the 
KS six and wras a dreaded spiker 
for opponents. He was a good 
team player and helped the KS's 
in the playoffs.
