CIT Spring Carnival 
Marks 50th Year
Carnegie Techites will celebrate the end of the first 50 years of 
the century in grand style at this year’s Spring Carnival on May 
11, 12 and 13.
The Carnival committee, headed by ME senior Ted Goodson, has 
chosen the events of the last half ?
century as a theme around which 
the Carnival program will be 
woven.
Old Favorites
Little change has been made in 
the timing of the program from 
last year; however, all the old 
favorites of the Carnival program 
are being revamped to provide the 
best in entertainment and fair 
competition for competing organ­
izations.
Major changes have been made

CIT Debaters Victorious In 
Grand National Tournament
CIT Triumphs 
Over 40 Colleges; 
Pugh Takes First
The Carnegie debate team, com­
posed of Joel Readio and Emerson 
Pugh on the affirmative side and 
Shirlee Ploegeh and Neil Johnson 
on the negative, won first place in 
the annual Grand Uational Debate 
Tournament held at Fredericks­
burg, Virginia, April 5 to 8. 
burg, Virginia, April 5 to 8.
The Tartan debaters, in compe­
tition with over 40 colleges from 
all over the United States, went 
through the four-day tournament 
with only one defeat, piling up a 
top point score of 26 to tie for 
highest honors with the men’s 
teams from the University of Ver­
mont and Penn State. This same 
Vermont team had won the New 
England championship earlier this 
year. Dartmouth, with a total of 
20 points, took second place. Ver­
mont and Penn State both suf­
fered their defeats against the 
Tartans in the tournament.
Pugh Takes First 
Emerson Pugh, the Carnegie 
captain and first place winner in 
the Pennsylvania extemporaneous 
speaking contest, came from be­
hind in the national contest to 
capture first place honors and the 
official title of “Grand National 
Speaker.” Entering the finals in 
the third place, Pugh defeated M. 
«Brenner of Penn State and W. 
Waynton of the University of 
South Dakota to take first place.
Coach Orville Baker and Ed­
ward McGehee spoke of the great 
pleasure they experienced in 
watching their team complete the 
most successful season in Carne­
gie’s history. Some of their great­
est pleasure came from the stellar 
performance of Neil Johnson, a 
freshman debater, who at the last 
minute replaced Hugh Young 
when the latter was unexpectedly

Sophomore 
Honoraries 
Hold Dance
Cent For Girl’s Pounds 
Is Price Of Admission; 
Benny Benack To Play
Lose weight, cut down on cal­
ories, and fight the battle of the 
bulge. Thin girls will have the ad­
vantage at the “Penny a Pound” 
dance to be held in the gym from 
9:00 to 1:00 on Saturday, April 22.
Cost will be determined by the 
weight of the girl—a penny for 
each pound. Tickets will be sold 
this week in Skibo for $1.00 with 
the extra cost to be paid at the 
dance. Girls who so desire may 
compete for the title of “lightest” 
and “heaviest”, the winners will 
have their admission refunded.
The maximum price will be 
$2.00, with all bald girls to be ad­
mitted free.
Night club effects will be used 
in decorating the gym. Tables will 
be arranged around the sides of 
the floor; the bandstand will be 
placed in the center. Refreshments 
will be furnished by APO.
Benny Benack with Gloria 
Bergman as vocalist, will furnish 
music for the affair. The all school 
dance is sponsored jointly by 
Cwens arid Scimitars, sophomore 
honoraries.

in both the Sweepstakes design 
and race rules. It was felt that in 
previous years the buggies which 
drew the outside position in the 
three buggy heats were at a dis­
advantage. Therefore, the num­
ber of buggies in each of the pre­
liminary heats, which are sched­
uled for Friday morning, have 
been reduced to two.
Exact Judging
Design rules have been com­
pletely rewritten to bring them 
up-to-date. Judging will be done 
on a basis similar to the method 
used at Greek Sing. Each of the 
three judges will keep a score- 
sheet which will be given to the 
participating organizations after 
the judging. The vehicles will be 
judged on both engineering and 
esthetic qualities.
The race itself will follow the 
same route as had been used in 
previous years. It starts in front of 
MMCC, proceeds through Schen- 
ley park on Schenley drive, 
around to Frew street, and up past 
Industries hall and Skibo. Each 
organization uses four pushers in 
the relay.
Packed House
Delta Tau Delta won the race 
last year in a record time of 2:42.5 
while Sigma Alpha Epsilon’s sleek 
aluminum pushmobile captured 
first place in the design compe­
tition. Pi Kappa Alpha took hon­
orable mention in both events. 
There are fourteen entries for the 
competition this year.

Kiltie Band
Gives Concert 
Friday Night
Music Hall Program 
To Include Procession 
Of Carnegie Bagpipers
Friday night the Kiltie band 
will present its annual Spring 
Concert at the Carnegie Music 
Hall. The program will start at 
8:15 p.m. with the (“Procession 
of the Pipers”.)
Under the baton of Director 
William A. Schaefer, the Kilties 
have prepared an ambitious pro­
gram of various types of musical 
compositionss Among the works 
to be performed are Borodin’s 
“Prince Igor Overture” and the 
popular “España Rhapsody” by 
Chabrier. In addition, the pro­
gram contains other symphonic 
band transcriptions and several 
marches.
The bandsmen will wear their 
colorful formal uniforms of black 
ties, tuxedo coats, sporrans and 
kilts. The bagpipers, however, will 
be clad in the regular marching 
regalia.
The band has been very active 
this concert season, having already 
performed in the Music Hall and 
Hampton High School in January 
and -at McKeesport High School 
on March 29. On March 31 the 
Kilties traveled to Edinboro, Pa. 
and presented -a formal evening 
concert at Edinboro State Teach­
ers College. The following day the 
band finished its short tour with 
two performances at Bradford 
High School, Bradford, Pa.
Next month the Kiltie band will 
again participate in the music fes­
tival of Pittsburgh’s Welcome 
Week. This year the band will be 
featured in a short concert and 
will also accompany a chorus of 
approximately 2000 singers.
Post Cards Are 
Sent Seniors
Mortar Board Sponsors 
Senior Ball For $2.00
Post cards are being sent to all 
seniors this week to determine 
whether the annual Senior Ball 
will be held this year. Seniors will 
be asked to fill out these cards and 
return them as reservations for 
the dance.
Since the Schenley hotel ball­
room must be reserved in advance, 
an insufficient response by the stu­
dents will mean no Senior Ball. 
The dance, limited to seniors, will 
be scheduled at the time of grad­
uation, with tickets at $2.00 each.
Currently sponsored by Mortar 
Board, the dance has always been 
highly successful in the past. In 
previous years the dance was 
sponsored by the school, with no 
admission charge; the current 
$2.00 price is necessary since a 
campus organization, and not the 
school, now sponsors the ball.

Editorials
A Change For The Better
The wave of dissention which is spreading 
among certain groups on campus over changes in 
this year's Spring Carnival program is probably 
as good an indication as anything that Carnegie 
students are satisfied and happy with the organ­
ization and execution of past Carnivals; for there 
is nobody quite as conservative as the satisfied 
customer — even though a proposed change may 
have ‘‘decided improvement” stamped all over it.
The first major change regarding Spring Car­
nival this year was the decision by the Scotch ’n 
Soda club to move from Carnegie Music Hall to 
the Gymnasium. This was not a “spur-of-the- 
moment” decision by S ’n S board, but came after 
several years of experience in staging musical 
productions under very adverse conditions at the 
music hall. The student body should accept the 
move on this fact alone.
Actually, however, there are several far-reach­
ing factors involved. Of prime importance is the 
immediate result which brings Scotch ’n Soda 
back to the students once again, after the past 
few years had seen that organization grow to 
such stature that it was nearing a professional 
group. To make a financially successful run at 
the music hall, it was necessary to depend on the 
support of the public. The resulting coordination 
of publicity, production, and technical groups 
greatly overlapped the purpose of such an organi­
zation at Carnegie Tech. Return to the campus 
will enable Scotch ’n Soda to stage a more col­
legiate-type musical show, providing better en­
tertainment for the student spectators, as well 
as mure fun for the participants.
Further, technical difficulties such as were en­
countered in sound amplification and scenery 
changes should be remedied to a great extent in 
moving to the more flexible confines of the gym.
A second major change in Spring Carnival 
plans will be announced in next week’s issue of 
the Tartan. We feel that this change will be met 
with considerable student disapproval at first. 
However, the entire change boils down to the 
results of careful planning by Spring Carnival 
Committee to bring the biggest and best Carnival 
which will fit within the means of the average 
student’s budget.
Seniors! It*s Up To ^ ou
Seniors will have a chance to decide for them­
selves whether or not they want a Senior Ball 
this year when postcard ballots are mailed out 
to the entire class of ’50. Mortar Board assumed 
sponsorship of the dance this year following the 
school’s refusal to foot the bill again after the 
apparent disinterest of past graduating classes in- 
the affair.
It seems strange that seniors have to be asked 
their preference on holding a dance which pro­
vides the entire class an opportunity to gather 
together as a whole for the last time as students. 
Instead they should display an instantaneous sup­
port to such a venture — one which is strictly 
confined to seniors. By grasping this dance as a 
form of class organization, the seniors would be 
taking an important step toward the foundation 
of a strong alumni class for the future.
It is hoped, also, that the interest of the grad­
uating class in the ball will be increased through 
the promotion of the dance by a student group, 
rather than by the school.

The Tartan carried a series of articles telling 
how “Tartan Editors Played War” in 1917. The 
editorials at that time “were of the flag-waving, 
jingoistic” type. The feature writer attempted to 
show the effect of propaganda which spread 
throughout the country and eventually led us into 
the first world war. The Tartan was politically 
minded that year.
FROM PILLAR TO POST
Letter To The Editor *
Man With Wax 
Is Censured
Editor, the Tartan:
Dear, Sir,
I’d like to know how many others feel the 
way I do about too slippery dance floors. Several 
of us at the King of Hearts ball thought the floor 
was particularly bad. When a group works so 
hard to plan and arrange an occasion like the 
King of Hearts ball, which is otherwise delight­
ful, it seems a downright shame that one person, 
who obviously doesn't know what he is doing, 
is allowed to spoil the best part, the dancing, 
by turning the floors into an ice rink. Used 
judiciously, dancing wax is fine; but in the hands 
of one eager, though uniformed helper, it can 
make hundreds of spirited couples resign them­
selves to an inspired two-step marathon.
My hat’s off to the committee for the ar­
rangements, the program, and the decorations, 
but to the man with the wax, not so good. In 
the future can’t we try the axiom that the wax 
is much easier to put on than to rub off and ap- 
ply only a very little at a time, more if it is 
needed.

Ten Years Ago...
The Tartan published an April 1 issue which 
carried such startling headlines as “Marriage Re­
lations Teacher Faces Wife’s Divorce Action”; 
“Girls Dorm Rules Reach New Law”; “Jane Arden 
et al Explodes Hoax on Existence of Drexy Do- 
hearty”; “Sex Is Just a Form of Energy.”
Student Council election was the subject of 
a hot and troubled controversy. The Tartan car­
ried an article showing statistics which proved 
that a small group of fraternities controlled Coun­
cil seats from 1930 to ’39. “Big Three” members 
then stole the issues of the Tartan which carried 
an exposee’ on the stuffing of ballot boxes in the 
last Council election and started a riot in Industries 
Hall. The Tartan Editor attempted to bring me­
chanical ballot boxes on campus for the election. 
The outcome of the issue was a sweeping victory 
by the Independent Party.
Spring Carnival plans included Glenn Miller’s 
band; the Friday Street Dance was an innovation; 
a girls buggy race was added to the Carnival 
schedule.

.. TOO MUCH..
The inside story of how 
this school is run . . . top 
officials, athletic policy, etc.
“OUT DAMNED SPOT” . . .
Danny Franks, instructor in Dra­
ma department, went to the hos­
pital to donate generously his 
blood for a transfusion. The needle 
was inserted—no blood! So Danny 
went home without any loss of 
blood(?>.
THE FOREST GRIEVES . . . 
The final production of “Richard 
III” featured several lines which 
Shakespeare did not include in his 
original script. The phrase, “The 
Forest Grieves” was added to key 
sentences during each act. The in­
sertion of that phrase is a tradition 
among Shakespearean actors.
ONE FRIDAY AFTERNOOON 
... No one less than Ralph Kiner 
visited the Dean of Women last 
Friday. Miss Campbell comment­
ed later, “I thought he came to 
give me a ticket to a baseball 
game, but he did not. I was dis­
appointed.”
“WANDERIN’” . . . The much 
publicized world traveler, “Man 
Without a Country,” Gareth Davis, 
attended Carnegie Tech as a fresh­
man drama student in 1940.
GOING UP . . . Perhaps you 
have been wondering whom the 
two men decorating the Engineer­
ing Hall addition could be. The 
plaques of Benjamin Franklin and 
Joshua Gibbs are now being put 
up on the front facade of the addi­
tion.
WHA’ HE SAY . . . The Journal 
of American Chemical Society re­
cently published a book which all 
intelligent chemical engineers 
should thoroughly enjoy. The ti­
tle? “A Kinetic Study of the Nat» 
ural Hydrolysis of Ethylene, Flu- 
oro-Bromo, and Iodohydrin!”
“BLOW THE MAN DOWN . . . 
The commander of the submarine 
“Pickerel” which gained publicity 
in national newspapers by remain­
ing submerged continually for 
twenty odd days is Paul Schratz, 
a graduate from the chemical en­
gineering department here.
FOOL OR FOOD . . . The campus 
food service was “done a dirty 
deed,” unintentionally of course, 
by an administration office secre­
tary. While she was typing a letter 
dealing with the food service on 
campus, she wrote, “the campus 
fool service is located ...”

HERE COMES THE 3RIDE . . . 
One of the fraternities gave as a 
door prize a basketball player to 
the lucky girl who held the win­

CARNEGIE PLAN . . . The public 
relations office has been swamped 
with requests for the pamphlet, 
“The Carnegie Plan in the News,” 
a reissue of newspaper and maga­
zine articles dealing with the Plan. 
Students who wish to send a copy 
to parents or friends may pick up 
the pamphlet in the public rela­
tions office.
RED ERROR ... A newspaper 
included in its “Let’s All Go to 
Church Sunday” column an ar­
ticle which read: “At 6:30 there 
will be a special candlelight Com­
munism service for young people 
of the church.”
FROM SMALL ACORNS ... In
the first graduating class of Car­
negie in 1906 there were only 158 
students. Carnegie has come a long 
way since then.

Principal, Students, 7o Confer Today
High School 
Educators To 
Attend Dinner
Smith, Wright Speak 
On Educational Policy; 
Professional Objectives
Principal speakers at this eve­
ning’s dinner meeting of high 
school and Carnegie educators will 
be Provost E. D. Smith and Dr. 
Austin Wright, head of the English 
department.
Provost Smith will present a 
brief discussion of the Carnegie 
policy of professional education 
and its relation to high school 
preparation. It is in the secondary 
schools that the student acquires 
the abilities necessary to gain the 
maximum benefits from college, 
just as Carnegie provides the stu­
dent with the techniques which 
enable him to continue to learn 
throughout life.
The Provost also plans to give 
the high school officials several 
examples of the types of academic 
problems the student can expect 
to encounter during his studies at 
Carnegie.
Dr. Wright will explain the ob­
jectives and policies of the English 
department at CIT, together with 
the type of work the student will 
be assigned.
Several local preparatory school 
officials are also scheduled to make 
remarks, and it is hoped that a 
period of general discussion on 
the problems of education can be 
held after the dinner program.

All students are urged to meet 
this afternoon with their former 
high school officials to exchange 
opinions and criticisms on the 
extent to which their secondary 
school training prepared them 
for work at Carnegie. The suc­

During the conference, the sec­
ondary school educators will talk 
with their former students about 
their collegiate progress and ac­
tivities.
The conference, patterned after 
similar successful programs held 
on other college campuses, may 
become an annual event if this 
first meeting proves to be a suc­
cess. Preliminary reports seem 
to indicate a high degree of stu­
dent interest in the conference.
Later, they will meet with Car­
negie faculty members to ex­
change views on secondary and 
college education. Various ex­
hibits are being planned by the 
Fine Arts department.
According to John M. Daniels, 
Carnegie’s Chairman of Admis­
sions. the program will be rounded 
out by a dinner meeting and en­
tertainment consisting of a water 
show and musical program.

4TA^^AIVTUESDAY, APRIL 18, 1950
Generally, a new sports editor devotes his first column 
to a statement of policy which will govern the manner in 
which campus sports activities and problems will be handled 
by his department. Since I am not one to break tradition, 
an explanation of this sort cannot be neglected.
Primarily, it will be the job of this sports staff to give 
complete coverage to all varsity and intramural sports activi­
ties on campus. Of course, a satisfactory job is not possible 
without the cooperation of the coaches and students who are 
connected with sports at Carnegie. It is hoped that such co­
operation will be forthcoming for, without it, many noteworthy 
sports events can easily be overlooked.
In addition to good sports coverage, it will be the aim 
of this department to give credit where credit is due, and to 
offer constructive criticism concerning sports activities. 
However, these pages will not be used for the purpose of 
intimidation of individuals and organizations.
We sincerely hope that we can avoid any unjust criti­
cism. If we do make mistakes, as we undoubtedly will, we 
will readily admit such errors publicly. We strongly en­
courage criticism by our readers, since improvement is pos­
sible only through such criticism. Also, suggestions by stu­
dents and faculty are an indication that our weekly efforts 
are at least being observed.
We would also like to take this opportunity to extend 
to all varsity coaches our best wishes for a successful season 
during the next year. Not only do winning teams bring satis­
faction to the team members, the school, and the coaches, but 
they are also advantageous to sports writing. After all, it’s 
much easier to write a story about a Carnegie victory than it is 
to tell about a defeat.
Riflemen Challenge Dukes, Pitt
The recent challenge extended to the Pitt and Duquesne 
rifle teams by the Tartan marksmen involves more than 
meets the eye. The Carnegie invitation to meet these two 
teams in a shoulder to shoulder match is aimed more at 
Duquesne than at the Panthers.
The Dukes, who won the National Hearst ROTC match 
and the Second Army competition, have been unbeatable 
in postal matches, where they fire on their own. range and 
mail the targets to the judges. However, when it is con­
sidered that the Tartans have defeated Duquesne in every 
shoulder to shoulder match between the two teams over 
the past two yars, it is inevitable that interested parties will 
begin to conclude that “something is rotten in Denmark.”
Therefore, the recent challenge to the Dukes is entirely 
justified. If Duquesne really does merit the championship laurels 
they have received, they should possess enough confidence to 
be willing to prove their marksmanship. If, on the other hand, 
they refuse the challenge, as they most likely will, it must 
be assumed that the recent talk of unfairness in postal matches 
on the part of the Dukes is true.
Fourteen Athletes Nominated 
For Outstanding Varsity Award
With the athletic year rapidly drawing to a close varsity coaches 
have named 11 men in anticipation of the second annual Tartan 
award to the outstanding varsity athlete of the year.
Present plans call for the presentation of the trophy together 
with similar recognition to the^to
top ranking intramural athlete at 
the intermission of the Saturday 
night dance of Spring Carnival.
All seven intercollegiate team 
heads reviewed their most recent 
campaigns and came up with the 
names of the star individual per­
formers on the campus.
Simeic Again 
Heading the list was hard driv­
ing Nick Simcic, two time winner 
of the Joe Pash trophy, as most 
valuable football player. The 
high scoring halfback stepped 
into a starting post two years ago 
with no scholastic background and 
promptly established himself as 
a district star.
Captain Gerry Meyers and 
quarterback Bobby Sommer 
rounded out the list of gridders. 
Meyers through four years has 
been the bulwark of a stout Tar­
tan line. His aggressive play and 
leadership on tfle field have always 
been a deciding factor in the lo­
cal eleven’s performances.
Sommer, on the other hand, 
played three years in backfield 
obscurity until the advent of Dr. 
Baker’s winged-T formation. Last
fall, however, found the strong 
armed ex-Mt. Lebanon athlete a 
key performer from his spot un­
der the center. His signal calling 
ability and accurate passing 
tabbed him early as a big threat 
to the opposition.
Soccer enthusiasts have named 
veteran Jack Burrey as their can­
didate for the honor. Burrey in 
three years on the squad has been 
a defensive standout. Already 
rated as one of the better backs 
in the district, the Plaid athlete 
should show even better next 
autumn.
Riehl, Theodore Considered
A highly successful basketball 
season must be partly credited to 
the performances of Jack Riehl 
and Mike Theodore. Riehl, top 
point getter, has been the driv­
ing force and playmaker for the 
rampaging “surprise” team of the 
district. Theodore, who received 
last year’s award, fell off his pre­
vious season’s pace but continues 
to rate as one of the best in the 
game. Hampered by back and leg 
injuries, the big Tartan captain 
[Continued on page 6]
Softball Entries
All entries for intramural soft­
ball must be in the Intramural 
Department office by 4:30 Thurs­
day, April 20. Mr. David See, 
Intramural Director,' has re­
quested that managers turn in 
their rosters on time in order 
that schedules can be drawn up 
and posted as soon as possible. 
Play is scheduled to begin on 
Tuesday, April 25.
Mr. See has also asked that 
any students interested in offi­
ciating at softball games contact 
him immediately.
Tennis Drills Halted 
By Inclement Weather
With spring practice conditions at an all-time low, Coach Frank 
Moses is working hard to get the Tartan tennis team into playing 
condition for its opening match of the season against Geneva Wed­
nesday, May 3, on the home courts.

Wins In IM 
Swim Meet
The Kappa Sigma swimming 
team, aided by three first places 
in the seven events, outscored all 
opposition in the intramural 
championship meet, netting 48 
points to 31 for runner-up Beta 
Sigma Rho. Delta Tau Delta 
swimmers took show place with 
20 points.
In the all-points scoring Kappa 
Sigma scored 151; Beta Sigma 
Rho, 105, and Delta Tau Delta, 72. 
Hans Lange won two first places 
for the Kappa Sigs by finishing 
first in the 50-yard breast stroke 
event, with a time of 29.2 seconds, 
and then in the 100-yard free­
style with a time of 1:09.0.
The third Kappa Sig first place 
was the 200-yard free-style relay. 
The team of Allen, Thode, Wick- 
man, 'md Alemany won in a 
clocking of 1:59.6.
Probably the most outstanding 
performance of the meet was the 
time turned in by the Beta Sigma 
Rho medley relay team of Leh­
man, Fried, and Abrams. The 
time was 1:39.2 for the 150-yard 
distance. Anchor-man Abrams 
also won the 50-yard free-style 
in 29.2 seconds, good time for 
intramural swimming.
Other first places were taken by 
Leo Schober, swimming for ASCE 
in the 50-yard back stroke, and 
Collett, swimming for Emanon, 
won the 200-yard free-style in 
2:54.3 seconds.

Track Team F aces 
Jeannette Harriers
Carnegie Hopes Pinned'On Luchok, 
Andrews In Tomorrow's Opener
By A. J. Christopher
Tomorrow afternoon Guy Halferty’s track team will get its first 
test of the year under fire when it takes on the Jeannette Harriers 
at the Skibo Bowl. This is the chance for Coach Halferty to check 
the effects of last years graduation on the present edition of the
? cindermen.
So far no one has been found to 
fill the vacancy left by Ernie 
Cassler, although it is hoped that 
is Johnny Luchok can devote 
more of his spare time to the track 
he will be the man Halferty is 
looking for.
Luchok is still the fastest pros­
pect the Tartans have, and his 
presence in the coming meets will 
be a big help. He recently took 
first place honors in the Senior 
indoor AAU meet.
Andrews Big Man 
< Coach Halferty still has another 
ace up his sleeve in the form of 
Jim Andrews, a transfer senior 
from Geneva. During the coming 
campaign it is hoped Andrews will 
be one of the major point-makers.
Although he could capably per­
form in all 15 events, it is expected 
he will confine his talents to the 
100-yard dash, the low hurdles, 
the high hurdles, the shot put, 
discus, and the javelin.
Further proof of Andrews’ ver­
satility is the fact that he annexed 
first place in the low hurdles in 
the Senior AAU indoor meet re­
cently held at South Park.
How They’ll Stand 
Event by event, this is how the 
Skibos will probably shape up this 
season:
100-yard dash—Luchok and An­
drews should hold their own 
against the best in the district.
220-yard dash—Bill McKibbin, 
veterans from.last year, and Fritz 
Wilson, another football man, will 
be driven hard jpy Ransil and

year’s squad, has alternated prac­
tice sessions between the courts 
at Mellon park and Carnegie, and 
have found neither in suitable 
playing condition.
As a result of this handicap, it is 
feared that the squad will not be 
in top playing form for the early 
season matches. To eliminate a 
recurrence of this situation in the 
future, Coach Moses has stated 
definitely that varsity tennis drills 
will begin in September.
Last year, the local netmen com­
piled a record of three victories, 
one tie, and five defeats. Two of 
the losses were by 5-4 margins. 
This year, with veterans forming 
the nucleus of the team, Coach 
Moses is hopeful of a winning sea­
son.
The future, however, depends 
largely on Ed Shoemaker, Coach 
Moses nomination as the out­
standing varsity athlete of the 
year. Shoemaker has shown rapid 
improvement throughout the past 
years and figures to be one of the 
standouts of the district.

Carnegie Gridmen To Battle 
Nebraska University Next Fall
Game Is Season Opener For Both Schools;
Approval Of Plan By Athletic Board Needed
Carnegie Tech football will return to a big-time status for one 
game next season. The Tartan gridders, until recently a doormat 
for even the smallest class B colleges, will open the 1950 football 
season against the University of Nebraska.
Even though definite plans have* 
been made, final word from the 
Department of Athletic? will not 
come until the proposal has been 
approved by the Athletic Board, 
scheduled to meet next week. 
However, it is expected that the 
Board will favor the game, and 
the Skibos will be headed toward 
their biggest grid battle in ten 
years.
According to Director of Inter­
collegiate Athletics Clarence 
(Buddy) Overend, the Tartans 
and Cornhuskers will meet on Sat­
urday, September 23, at Lincoln, 
Nebraska. The game will be the 
first of the season for both schools.
Considerable talk has been cir­
culating during the past month 
that Carnegie was attempting to 
add another game to the 1950 
schedule but most speculators 
thought it would be with one of 
the Ivy League schools. Not until 
last week did the news materialize 
naming Nebraska the opponent.
Although Carnegie’s Dr. Eddie 
Baker and Biff Glassford, Ne­
braska coach, both of whom are 
Pitt graduates, were instrumental 
in arranging the game, the final 
decision was left up to the present 
members of the Tartan squad.
Movies of last year’s Nebraska- 
Penn State game were shown to 
the team, and then the players 
voted on the question of whether 
they wanted to play the Huskers.
Seventeen Men 
Seek Award
IM Athlete Of Year 
To Be Honored Soon
Seventeen candidates have been 
named as possible winners of the 
Tartan’s second annual award to 
the outstanding intramural ath­
lete of the year.
Once again Jack Collins, last 
year’s winner, heads the list. Pair­
ed with Bill Repovz, Collins gives 
Phi Kappa a strong double repre­
sentation.
Only two other organizations 
can boast more than one candi­
date. The Dorm Dukes have both 
Milt DeJean and Dick Emmer 
listed while Delta Tau Delta has 
named George Pyle and John 
Bishop.
Emanon, leading the all points 
race, will be represented by Frank 
Witt while the number one fra­
ternity, Sigma Nu, has named Bill 
de Vos.
Other candidates for the trophy 
are: A1 Yarian (PiKA); Earl Lat- 
terman (Beta Sigs); Larry Blu- 
menthal (Tau Delts); Arne Oberg 
(SAE); Bill Oxley (TX); Frank 
Motter (Kappa Sig); Jim Kessel 
(DU); Ed Griffin (Betas); Jim 
Butler (Citcom).
Latterman, Oxley, Motter and 
Kessel are not new to the intra-
Reporters Wanted
The Tartan is in need of 
sports reporters, preferably 
freshmen and sophomores 
who would enjoy writing a 
varsity or intramural sports 
article each week. Previous 
experience is helpful but not 
essential. All those interested 
in this type of activity should 
contact Fred Lunt at the Tar­
tan office in Carnegie Union 
at 8:30 p.m. this Friday, or by 
telephoning SC. 1-9580.
Tartan Gridders Open 
Spring Season Today
St. Francis Tests Plaid Strength 
In Clash At Bowl This Afternoon
Dr. Eddie Baker will give Carnegie football followers a sneak 
preview of the 1950 Tartan gridiron machine this afternoon, as he 
sends his stalwarts against St. Francis in a spring exhibition game.
Hostilities are scheduled to begin at 3:30 in Skibo Bowl.
The game is the first of a ten­
tative four-game spring scrimmage 
session for the locals. Although 
dates have not been set for the
other three tussles, plans ca* for
the Skibos to meet both the Du- 
quesne varsity and junior varsity, 
as well as the Pitt junior varsity. 
Questions 
Today’s contest with the 
Frankies, a team which fell be­
fore the Plaid by a 28-19 count 
last Fall, will help provide Coach 
Baker with the answers to two 
important questions.
First, will the Tartans be able 
to repeat their winning season of 
last year without the services of 
such seasoned performers as 
Gerry Meyers, Norm Keats, Bob 
Sommer, Wes Kenney, Jim Traut- 
man, Steve Madden, and others 
who have worn their jerseys for 
the last time?
Secondly, will the first-year 
men from last year’s squad form 
a strong enough line to stand up 
against the powerful opposition to 
be met next fall?
TARTAN BACKS TO FACE ST. FRANCIS TODAY
Pictured above are the eight backfield men who will see action 
against St. Francis this afternoon. In the rear row are the first team 
backs, from left to right, Rubin, Luchok, Holtz, and Dissen. In 
the front row are the second team ball carriers, Schechter, Lea- 
man, Oberg, and DeGiovanni.
mural followers. All four were 
nominated for last spring’s bal­
loting but lost the honor to Collins.
In addition to Collins; De Jean, 
Emmer, and Witt round out the 
list of those who are making their 
second appearance on the nominat­
ing roster.
Veteran Golf Team 
To Open Season 
Against Duquesne \
Upon the arrival of warmer 
weather in the vicinity of the 
Schenley park golf course, Coach 
Buddy Overend will send his un­
dergraduate golf enthusiasts into 
practice sessions for the impending 
1950 season. The opening match, 
against Duquesne, is scheduled for 
Friday, April 28.
Coach Overend was treated 
kindly by last June’s graduation, 
and will open the season with a 
team composed of veteran per­
formers. In addition to six hold­
overs from last year’s squad, 
which broke even over the sea­
son, he will be aided by several 
experienced freshmen and the re­
turn of Joe Holland, a pre-war 
stalwart.
The opposition this year will be 
furnished by Duquesne, Geneva, 
Westminster, Thiel, Waynesburg, 
and Grove City. The last two are 
the only home matches of the sea­
son, and will be played at the 
Pittsburgh Field Club.
Answers
Definite answers to these ques­
tions will, of course, not be forth­
coming as a result of this after­
noon’s battle, but it should pro­
vide the coaching staff with an 
idea of how the newcomers will 
react under fire.
Conspicuously absent from the 
gridiron will be halfbacks Nick 
Simcic and Elmer Metzger, who 
provided most of the scoring 
punch last season, and guard 
Larry Stovicek, one of the biggest 
factors in the great showing of 
last year’s line.
Simcic Out
Simcic recently underwent an 
operation for the removal of a 
cartilage from his left knee and 
will not return to action until 
September. Both Metzger and 
Stovicek are devoting their time 
to school work.
Slated for starting assignments 
on either the offensive or defen­
sive teams for the first time to­
day are tackles Clyde Stahle and 
Bob Odeh, guards Joe Galanda 
and Herm Whitenight, centers

Pitt, Dukes Challenged 
By Carnegie Riflemen
The Carnegie Tech rifle team has issued a challenge to the rifle 
teams of both Duquesne University and the University of Pitts­
burgh. It is felt by the members of the team that they could emerge 
victorious in such a tree-way match.
It is interesting to note that Du-* *

tain of the C.I.T. rifle team, sent a 
letter to the captains of both the

will be undertaken immediately

Pitt Dukes Defeat Emanon InINTRAMURAL RESUME
Rifle
Alpha Tau Omega retained their 
intramural rifle crown defeating 
the SAE’s and the Betas in the 
rifle finals. The ATO’s bettered 
their two previous records of 
957 x 12300 in 1948 and 968 x 1200 
in the semi-finals with a 984 x 
1200 score. SAE followed with a 
961 x 1200 score.
Jim Vodenichar of ATO tied the 
prone record of Joe Lux of the 
Betas and Poe of ATO’s ’49 squad 
with a 99 x 100, and he set a 
standing record of 83 x 100. Vo­
denichar also tied the three posi­
tion record of 270 made by Poe in 
1949. Ralph Snyder of SAE re­
tained his kneeling record of 91 x 
100 made in the semi-finals.
Soccer
Snow and cold weather some­
what hindered the opening of the 
intramural soccer season. Only 
the Dorm Dukes and ATO’s braved 
the cold on Thursday, the first 
day of competition, as the Dukes 
downed the ATO’s 5-1.
Fourteen teams in two leagues 
have entered the competition 
which often leaves a long list of 
injured behind. It is hoped that 
with the addition of shin guards 
and better officiating, the injuries 
will decrease.
In the other games of the first 
week Citcom forfeited to Kappa 
Sigma, and Phi Kappa defeated 
the DU’s 2-0. The two tallies were 
both made in the first quarter by 
Strolbe and D’Agostino. Emanon 
claimed a 3-0 victory over Beta 
Sigma Rho. The goals were ac­
counted for by Ray Core, Art 
Pienkosk, and Frank Witt.
Badminton
Emanon and Delta Tau Delta 
have each won three games in 
intramural badminton to tie for 
the lead in the Tartan League. ^ 
Badminton, which had its start in 
March, is scheduled -to be com­
pleted before May 2.
In the Plaid League only three 
of the scheduled matches have 
been played. It is urged that those 
teams play their matches as soon 
as possible.

Intramural Basketball Playoff
Battle For City Supremacy Marked By Poor 
Officiating; Katsefanas Leads Emanon Scorers
Emanon took an early lead in 
a game which turned out to be a 
rough-and-tumble affair with both 
teams losing men due to personal 
fouls. Pete Katsafanas paced the 
Emanon five in the first half when 
they outscored the Dukes by three 
points.
Emanon fell by the wayside in 
the third quarter as bitter pro­
tests against the officiating ended 
in Bill Wilde leaving the game. 
Pitt outscored Emanon by ten 
points gaining a seven point ad­
vantage.
In the final period Emanon re­
gained their balance but failed to 
overcome the lead before the final 
whistle was sounded.
Pete Katsafanas held the scor­
ing honors for the game with 
seven field goals and six free 
throws to total 20 points. Katsa­
fanas was forced to leave the 
game in the final period as five 
personal fouls were called against 
him.
Basketball Summary
Pitt again triumphed over the 
Tartan intramural champions as 
the Pitt Dukes eged out a 57-53 
victory over Emanon. The contest 
was staged on the Dukes home

Scot Losses Scored; 
Election Dates Fixed
Honorary Constitutions Accepted; 
Carnival Queen Campaign Date Set
Having lost $230 this year, $126 on the last issue, the Scot re­
ceived another warning and a set of publication rules from the pub­
lication and budget committees of Student Council at the March 29 
meeting. • ~
Bob Carpenter, elections chair­
man, submitted the proposed 
dates for the spring elections. 
The Spring Carnival Queen elec­
tion is April 28; Student Council 
election, May 9 and 10, and 
Classes of 1952 and 1953 officers 
election, May 18.
Constitutions Approved 
Delta Skull and the Scimitars 
presented their constitutions for 
Council’s approval. Both were 
accepted, except for a section in 
each which gave only the presi­
dent power to call meetings. Fred 
Lunt thought that one-third of 
the members should also be able 
to call meetings. Delta Skull also 
had a clause limiting membership 
to 15. The honoraries will have 
to revise these to meet Council’s 
approval.
Budget chairman, Art Zuch, 
suggested that the Scot go on pub­
lishing, but change to a regula­
tion size magazine. No national 
advertisers will place an adver­
tisement in a pocket size college 
magazine. He also suggested an 
increase in the size of the adver­
tising staff.
A decrease in the size of the 
advertising staff was recommend­
ed by Dick Hoel, Publications 
Committee. He thought the cir­
culation staff should cut the size 
of their order from the printer. 
Since the next issue will carry 
the Spring Carnival program, its 
circulation should receive a boost.
To Check Scot
Zuch and his committee are go­
ing to review the magazine be­
fore it is sent to the printer, and 
if they think it won’t stay out of 
the red, it won’t be published.
Campaigning for the Carnival 
Queen election will be April 24 
to 28; and only men, both gradu­
ate and under-graduate, will vote. 
Both class officer elections will 
be at the same time. The Coun­
cil election will be both Tuesday 
and Wednesday again, since more 
students are able to vote.
Election Notice
Freshman and sophomore 
class organizations elections 
for the positions of president, 
vice-president, secretary, 
treasurer, for each class next 
year will be held May 18. Pe­
titions for all positions may be 
obtained in the Dean of Men’s 
office starting April 18 and are 
due back April 30.
Debate Club

called away due to an illness in 
his family. Neil and Shirlee 
completed the tournament with­
out dropping a decision.
Next Year Hopeful
Readio, Pugh, and Shirlee 
Ploeger had been semi-finalists in 
the Pennsylvania elimination 
tournament March 10 and 11 
where Pugh and Readio were the 
only undefeated affirmative team 
in the preliminary rounds.
The Tartan successes this year 
began when Fritz Friedlander, 
Arnold Sherman, Hugh Young, 
and Shirlee Ploeger tied for sec­
ond place in the Washington and 
Jefferson tournament March 3 and
4. This was followed by winning 
third place in the State elimina­
tions, and is now topped by the 
crowning glory of Grand National 
Champions. This steady improve­
ment predicts another victorious 
season next year, especially since 
all the varsity debaters will re­
turn in 1950-51.
Council Election
There will be an election for 
Student Council Tuesday, 
May 9 from 11:15 to 1:45.
Campaigning will be per­
mitted from April 1 through 
11:00 a.m., April 9.
Those to be considered as 
candidates must have a peti­
tion signed by 40 full time day 
students from the school 
which they wish to represent. 
These petitions must be turn­
ed in to the Dean of Men’s of­
fice by Tuesday, April 25, at 
4:00. Petitions can be picked 
up in the Dean’s office.

Architects Hold 
Dinner, Exhibit
Town, City Planning 
In Abercrombie's Talk
Carnegie’s Architectural Student 
Group will present Sir Patrick 
Abercrombie, renowned British 
architect and town planner, as 
guest speaker at their spring ban­
quet to be held April 21 at the 
Hotel Webster Hall.
Tau Sigma Delta, honorary arts 
fraternity recently reorganized at 
Carnegie, will sponsor an exhibi­
tion of town planning in conjunc­
tion with Sir Patrick’s visit.
The famous architect will be in 
this country to receive the Gold 
Medal for 1950 from the American 
Institute of Architects in Wash­
ington, D. C. His Pittsburgh ad­
dress will be one of .the few pub­
lic appearances he will make while 
in the United States.
In singling out Abercrombie for 
their highest award, AIA has 
shown rare judgment. Though less 
widely known than some of his 
contemporaries because of this ex­
treme modesty, he has developed 
brilliant schemes for the rebuild­
ing of such English cities as Hull, 
Plymouth and Edinburgh. His 
studies for Paris, Brussels, Vienna, 
and Berlin are used as standard 
reference works.
The Architectural Student 
Group, which broke from the na­
tional architecture honorary, Scar­
ab, to follow its own policies, is 
emerging as a helpful arm for Car­
negie’s architecture department.
Details on the banquet can be 
obtained from Harvard Johe, sen­
ior architect and president of ASG.

The Home Economics club will

INQUIRING REPORTER—
What Does Scot Have? 
—Appeal Or Appall
The Scot magazine made its 
debut on campus this year, step­
ping into the publication niche 
vacated by the Scottie. Although 
the Scot has aimed to fulfill the 
literary tastes of students, its cir­
culation department has found 
some trouble selling it. “What do 
you think of the Scot?”, the in­
quiring reporter asked Techites. 
“Do you believe it satisfies the 
reading tastes of the average col­
lege student?”
John McKee, freshman: “I think 
it’s pretty good; 
the stories are 
fairly well 
written and 
photography is 
fine. A mag­
azine like the 
old Scottie is 
not the best 
thing for a 
school; other 
people read it 
off campus and get a wrong im­
pression of the college.”
Jack Braun, senior: “The Scot 
is a good attempt at bringing the 
lighter side of college life to stu­
dents; at times
the magazine ^ •

magazine that
is on a par with the former Scot­
tie. Of course some of the jokes 
may be shady but we are college 
students, supposedly adults, and 
as an adult should be able to 
raise above terms as ‘dirty jokes’ 
and realize the proper significance 
of such trivia.”
Jack Stewart, senior: “The Scot 
is defunct. It 
doesn't answer 
the needs of 
the student 
body. I do like 
the pocket-size 
of the maga­
zine. I’d like to 
see the Scottie 
back on the 
campus. That 
magazine 
fact, it was tame 
compared to some other college 
magazines.”
Marines Offer 
Summer Camp
Training Plan Leads 
To Marine Commission
Capt. Murray O. Roe, Marine 
Corps representative for the Pla­
toon Leaders Class program will 
be in Pittsburgh at the Old Post 
Office Building until May 15, 1950, 
to interview and to screen appli­
cants few this year’s summer train­
ing program leading to regular 
or reserve commissions in the 
United States Marine Corps.
Eligible for training under the 
PLC program are college fresh­
man and sophomores who have 
reached their 17th birthdays and 
who will be under 25 years of 
age on July 1 of the calendar year 
in which they become eligible to 
receive their commissions.
The PLC, a Marine Corps officer 
procurement program established 
in 1935, was resumed in 1947, after 
interruption during World War II. 
Unlike the Reserve Officer Train­
ing program, Platoon Leaders do 
not take military subjects during 
their academic year. They receive 
all military instruction during two 
summer periods of six weeks each, 
at Quantico. Va.
Members of the Platoon Leaders 
Class are paid while on active 
duty training, receiving $95.55 a 
first summer
Jean Miller, senior: “The Scot 
has fine pho­
tography and 
the articles are 
^ good. It is cer- 
tainly an im- 
WW provement o n 
^ A. Scottie.It is a maga- 
zinc you can be
¦¦¦¦ home show 
your parents. I wouldn't have 
dared bring the Scottie home. I 
think the magazine is getting bet­
ter every issue. In time it will be 
excellent.”
Shirlee Ploeger, sophomore: “I
like the photograph in the Scot 
very much. I’d
suggest that the 3# ;
more under- !
standable car- c ||
toons, more wfy-< -v i
pictures and i
shorter feature \
r e g i s t ration
card feature flHwHH 
was ° g 1 1 7
clever. I think that the magazine 
is getting a little too arty. I’d 
rather see the Scot as the humor ; 
publication on campus than the 
Scottie brand of humor.”
Freda Alexander, seuior: “The 
Scot is a good magazine; I like the 
pictures. The articles are fairly 
i n t e resting. I 
always buy the 
magazine.
Why? Oh, the 
first time I 
bought it out of 
curiosity; the 
second, the 
cover looked 
good; the third,
I heard about 
the registration 
pictures. I’ll support a campus 
publication but I wish it were 
more like the Scottie; it would be J 
better. The Scottie seemed more . 
the typical college magazine.”
If these students represent a 
cross-section of, the Carnegie stu- : 
dent body, it seems apparent that 
the Scot is quite okay in the worn- j 
en’s opinion while the men are 
not wholly enthusiastic over the ¦ 
magazine.

Coeds Join In Sports Program; 
Six Local Schools Represented
Tech, Pitt Sponsor “Spring Tonic Play Day” 
As Mixed Teams Compete For Lollipop Prize
Coeds from six district colleges gathered last Saturday on the 
Carnegie campus for a “Spring Tonic Play Day.” The program, 
under the joint sponsorship of Carnegie Tech and the University 
of Pittsburgh, lasted from 10:00 a. m. to 4:00 p. m.
Five girls and an adviser repre-
sented each of the colleges. The 
day of sports included badminton, 
volleyball, basketball, and ended 
with a splash in the pool.
Teams did not represent the 
j schools participating, but were 
' mixed with girls from different 
! colleges. Each team challenged 
each other for the grand prize 
I which was a box of lollipops.
Besides Carnegie and Pitt, col­
leges taking part included Edin- 
boro State Teachers, California 
State Teachers, Indiana State 
Teachers, and Geneva.
Carnegie girls assisting with the 
program were Nancy Montgomery, 
Emma Elwell, Enid Orr, Dorothy 
Douglass, and Helen Halkas.

Three Students 
Awarded GE 
Fellowships
Architects Win 
Three Prizes
f Mitchell Is Second 
In National Contest
Three building designs by Car­
negie Institute of Technology 
architecture students have been 
awarded prizes in a* national arch­
itectural competition. The com­
petition, sponsored by Timber En­
gineering Company, affiliated with 
National Lumber Manufacturers 
* Association, was for design of an 
k eight-family garden-type apart­
ment building of wood construc­
tion.
The three Carnegie winners, all 
seniors in the Architecture De­
partment, worked in conjunction 
with juniors in the department in 
the preparation of their prize- 
winning entries.
Allan B. Mitchell, senior, assist­
ed by Harold E. Noelker, junior, 
f) was awarded second student prize 
oi $250.
Anthony Ferrainolo, senior, 
working with George Balta, jun­
ior, won a major honorable men­
tion award of $100.
Donald E. Hunter, senior, asso­
ciated with Herbert Maddalene, 
junior, received a student honor­
able mention award of $50.
The architectural problem pos- 
n ed by the competition was for the 
k‘ design and plot layout of a resi­
dential apartment building of 
wood frame construction. The 
structure, limited to two stories 
in height, was to provide living 
accommodation for eight families 
having a moderate income.
Three Carnegie Institute of 
Technology students, John N. 
Grace, Thomas E. Stelson, and 
Richard E. Cutkosky, have been 
awarded Gerard Swope Fellow­
ships for graduate work at Car­
negie by the General Electric' 
Company.
Carnegie students won three out 
of eleven national awards, found­
ed in honor of Gerard Swope, 
third president of General Elec­
tric, and given for advanced 
study in industrial management, 
engineering, the physical sciences, 
and various scientific and indus­
trial fields.
Grace received one award to 
continue his research on a fluid- 
flow computer. He graduated from 
Carnegie in 1949 with a B.S. de­
gree in electrical engineering, and 
is studying at Carnegie for his 
master’s in that field.
Stelson was awarded a fellow­
ship to continue research in fluid 
mechanics. He graduated from 
Carnegie with a B.S. degree in 
civil engineering in 1949, and has 
been studying for a master’s de­
gree.
Cutkosky is to continue research 
in theoretical physics, under the 
terms of his award. He will re­
ceive the B.S. and M.S. degrees in 
physics from Carngie in June, and 
has also been awarded a student 
fellowship for the summer of 1950 
by the Bureau of Standards, In­
stitute for Numerical Analysis,

That Real Scotch Flavor
Technical Will Offer Interesting 
Variety Of Scientific Articles
The next issue of the Technical, which will be out on Tuesday, 
April 18, offers an interesting variety of articles in the field of science.
Director Jones presented an ad-4 
dress entitled “Training for Pro­
fessional Competence” at the re­
cent chemical engineering con­
vention in Pittsburgh. What he 
says is significant for all college 
students.
The important mathematical 
“Eigenvalue Problem” is posed and 
solved by Douglas Shaffer, a tech­
nique which should interest phys­
icists and engineers as well be­
cause of its rapidly growing field 
of applications.
Civil engineers have found that 
concrete with a high water content
pours easily but is of low quality. 
Peter Accorti, CE senior, offers a 
solution to this problem in an 
article on “Vacuum Concrete.”
“Music Printing” by Robert 
Levy, PA sophomore, presents a 
discussion on one of the many 
complex printing problems.
Charles Norris, EE senior, de­
scribes the problems of determin­
ing the electrical characteristics 
of the human head and the effec­
tiveness of various wave forms in 
his article on the development of 
“Electroshock Therapy.”

Daughter Dances
In addition to his work with 
bagpipes at Carnegie, Mr. David­
son is pipe major of Clan Doug­
las in Wilkinsburg. Since Waynes- 
burg college has added a bagpiper 
section to their band, he teaches 
there also. His nine year old 
daughter, Mary Elizabeth, has 
often danced in the traditional 
Scottish style for Carnegie stu­
dents. Although the bagpipes are 
his first love, Mr. Davidson is also 
a supervisor at the Union Switch 
and Signal.
Some students who attempt to 
play the pipes find it is harder 
than it looks. Mr. Davidson smiles 
at times and exclaims, “For Heav­
en’s sake, A’ve had lots o’ noises 
frae the pipes, but this aine beats 
them a’.”
Spring Carnival
(Continued from Page 1) 
and it is expected the Carnegie 
Theater will be packed for the 
third straight year to watch the 
lovely lassies present Varsity Var­
ieties.
The program, which consists of 
eight to twelve minute skits by 
each of the sororities and Citcom 
women, will highlight the Satur­
day afternoon portion of the pro­
gram. The skits are usually satir­
ical or humorous or both. Last 
year the Theta’s walked off with 
the honors after presenting a satire 
on Scotch ’n Soda. Second place 
was won by Chi Omega while Al­
pha Epsilon Phi took third honor.
Of course the Carnival will pro­
vide cointinuous entertainment on 
the Midway which opens Thurs­
day afternoon of the gala week­
end. Other events such as the float 
parade, coronation, and the dances 
have been scheduled and more in­
formation will be announced in 
next week’s Tartan.

Learning To Play Bagpipes Not 
Easy, Says Director Davidson
The Kilties are coming! The eerie music of the pipes echoes 
over the football stadium.
And the Kilties have the r-real Scutch flavor-r, for Mr. Lewis 
Davidson, their teacher, is a native son of Coatbridge, Scotland.
f Mr. Davidson will say that 
| learning to play bagpipes is no 
| simple task. Very rarely does an 
experienced bagpiper enroll at 
i Carnegie Tech, therefore Lewis 
i Davidson must completely train 
j each of the Kiltie bagpipers. It 
! takes him eighteen months, mini- 
| mum time, to train a bagpiper. 
Synchronization Counts 
“The most important thing for 
| beginners to learn is synchroniz- 
; ing the arm, the lips, the lungs, 
i and the fingers,” explained Mr. 
\ Davidson. “When the player 
1 wants to rest from blowing, he 
1 presses the air-filled bag which 
j he holds under his arm; in this 
: way he can still play music with- 
| out tiring himself out. In the 
; meantime, the fingers manipulate 
| the pipe part of the instrument.
! The tenor and base drones, which 
j carry the prominent monotones 
1 as background melody, are ad- 
i justed over the shoulder.”
When the President’s wife, Mrs. 
, Robert Doherty, donated several 
j bagpipes to the school in 1940, the 
> Kiltie Band was faced with the 
problem of finding trained bag- 
pipers and someone who could 
; teach bandsmen to play the “con­
founded windbags.” It was then 
j that Mr. Davidson came to the as- 
j sistance of the Kilts, and he has 
been responsible for the fine corps 
ever since.

were held this past weekend. The 
revue is scheduled to run three 
nights beginning on the Tuesday

Adelman Play 
Set In Oakland 
oP ens April 21
April 21 begins the one week 
run of the drama department’s 
production of “Lady, Ride My 
Shoulder,” which will be present­
ed under the direction of Lawr­
ence Carra. The play was writ­
ten by senior drama student, Louis 
Adelman, »vhose play, “Corner of 
God,” was presented last year as 
one of the Tech Little Theatre 
productions.
In contrast with “Corner of 
God,” whose setting was Brook­
lyn, this story is centered in the 
housing project above Oakland.
In the playwrite’s own words, 
“It is the story of Ernie Monkow- 
chick, an ambitious young man, 
w^ho is so strong he is weak. This 
tragedy is the tragedy of im­
patience evolving out of an ina­
bility to adjust to a life he had 
created for himself.”
Leading roles in the play in­
clude Norman Keats as Ernie 
Monkowchick; Delphine Force as 
his w4fe, Sylvia; Rose Schulman 
as Mrs. Valencia; and Bob Mc­
Clain as Dan Keegan.
Many Freshmen
Surveyal of Scotch and Soda 
casting lists reveals twro striking 
characteristics of this year’s pro­
duction. First, four of the 25 main 
roles are being played by non­

jobs such as directing, stage man­
aging, set designing, etc. Second,

Climax Of Social Season
A Spring Dance, featuring Benny Benack and his wellknown 
orchestra will be the grand climax to a successful social season for 
the Evening School. An informal dance, it is scheduled to take place 
on Saturday, May 6, 1950, at Thistle Hall from 8:45 to 12:00 p. m.
Benny Benack, better known as* — " ~
the “local Harry James” because 
of his antics with the trumpet, 
will lead a group of ten musicians 
and a girl vocalist. Benny is also 
well known as Assistant Director 
of the University of Pittsburgh 
Concert Band.
Features of the dance will be 
the awarding of an outstanding 
door prize to some lucky couple 
and the gift of a beautiful flower 
to the first 100 ladies who bring 
their husbands or boy friends to 
the affair. The door prize is the 
workmanship of Jim Frappe, 
council member and Fine- Arts 
student. Jim is noted for his skill 
in fabricating novelties, pins, from 
bits of scrap metal and discarded 
gems. Refreshments will be 
served as usual in the Black Cat 
and the Black Cat Lounge under 
the supervision of Will Schnar- 
renberger. Decorating is in charge 
of Ray Schwalm, who has become 
a master at turning drab Thistle 
Hall into a beautiful ball room.
Checking will be handled by the 
ever capable Frank Mihelich. 
Believe it or not, the price of each 
ticket is only $2.25 per couple.
Tickets are on sale each even­
ing at Mt. Dalziel McKelway’s 
Office. George Bogovich, ticket 
chairman, and numbers of the 
evening student council also have 
them to sell.
Correction
In one of the articles that 
appeared in the last issue of 
the Plaid, an error was made. 
In referring- to the services 
provided by the libraries, the 
article read “the main li­
brary’s simple facilities” in­
stead of “ample facilities.” 
The writer sincerely regrets 
that the mistake occurred, and 
wishes to make known that 
the statement resulted from a 
typographical error.

Phi Gamma Pi 
Tea Held At 
Carnegie Union
The new pledges of Phi Gamma 
j Pi sorority entertained the mem- 
j bers at a tea on April 16 at the 
Carnegie Union. Mothers of the 
members were also present. The 
j tea offered a splendid opportunity 
for the members to become well 
acquainted with the new pledges. 
President Betty Lakatos informed 
us that the sorority will initiate 12 
new members at its business 
| meeting on Sunday, April 30.
Although the sorority is the 
; newest social group on the Eve- 
| ning School campus, it is one of 
i the most active, offering the girls 
j an opportunity to participate in 
numerous social gatherings.
This group has pledged itself to 
the establishment of an Evening 
School scholarship fund. The 
members have taken this pledge 
seriously, and they feel that their 
goal will be reached within a short 
period of time.
IVewis
And
Views
We may as well start our column 
with congratulations, since they 
are well deserved. George Schus- 
sler, our Editor, is the proud papa 
of a fine baby girl, Mama Schus- 
sler is doing fine. Members of 
council and Plaid workers wish 
baby Nancy the best of everything.
The new play to be presented by 
the Carnegie Tech Drama Depart­
ment is to be, “Lady Ride My 
Shoulder.” We might remind Eve­
ning Students that they may ob­
tain free tickets to the play if 
hurry to the Evening School Reg­
istrar’s Office. There are only 
limited number of these tickets 
available, so get yours early.
Just to get in our plug for the 
Engineering Banquet, we would 
like to acknowledge the hard work 
that co-chairmen Chuck Keller 
and Leroy Rowland have done on 
this affair. Their efforts 
make this one of the best banquets 
yet, judging from the 
they have been reciving to re­
quests for door prizes and souv- 
eniers.
After much discussion and 
study, the difficulties encountered 
in planning successful Evening 
Student Council dances boil down 
to just one: council needs more 
aggressive ticket sellers for their 
affairs. Of course most evening 
students hate the idea of someone 
constantly harping on the same 
old theme, but if this is to be the 
solution, then members of Council 
should make it their business to 
contact individually as many eve­
ning students as possible with a 
good sales talk.
Engineer’s Banquet To 
Hear Robert Downie

"Cost Of Our Federal Government”
Robert C. Downie, President of the Peoples First National Bank

Mr. Downie will discuss “The

Door prizes, entertainment, and

Cost of our Federal Government,” 
a subject which he is well quali­

the position of chairman of the

Since his graduation from Du-

The Thirty-fifth Banquet, held 
during the year in which Carne­
gie Tech celebrates its Fiftieth 
Anniversary promises to be of 
memorable importance. Not only 
is the speaker outstanding, but 
sixty-five companies have re­
sponded to requests for souve- 
nieres and door prizes. The num­
ber and quality of the door prizes 
exceed anything that has been 
seen in the past, since many com­
panies preferred to send a valu­
able door prize rather than small 
souvenieres.
The entertainment will be pro­

The Aroma Tells You.••
We tobacco farmers know that when tobaccos smell 
milder they smoke milder. That’s how smokers can know 
that the mild, ripe tobaccos Chesterfield buys from me 
and hundreds of other farmers will taste better, smoke 
cooler and much milder.
That’s why I’ve smoked Chesterfield for 15 years.. -
