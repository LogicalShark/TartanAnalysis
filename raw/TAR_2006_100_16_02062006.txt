The Zeta Beta Tau (ZBT) fraternity is 
returning to Carnegie Mellon with high 
hopes of strong bonds, networking, and 
fun. “We’re social.... We want to throw 
parties,” said junior self-defined major 
and ZBT co-founder Max Lerner.
Devoted to building ZBT anew, 
Lerner, along with sophomore com­
puter science major Andrew Warshaver 
and sophomore business major Josh 
Mann, want to do things their way. “We 
fell through the cracks of Greek life at 
CMU,” said Warshaver. “This is catered 
toward us.”
Starting a fraternity began as a joke, 
according to Mann, but now it’s bud­
ding into reality. Mann was looking to 
begin his own fraternity at the same 
time that ZBT was talking about re­
starting their CMU chapter. Meetings 
with the Pittsburgh chapter of ZBT and 
the past president of the national chap­
ter were very positive, Mann said.
The previous ZBT chapter of CMU 
ended its nine-year stint in 1983 after 
a close call with alcohol poisioning and 
an incident of fighting with another stu­
dent organization. University adminis­
tration expelled ZBT from campus, and 
its then-members formed what is now 
Sigma Tau Gamma.
For Warshaver, Mann, and Lerner, this 
is a new endeavor, and the possibilities 
seem endless. From campus involve­
ment to the kinds of meals served, the 
input of new members matters to them. 
“We’re pioneers, basically,” said Mann.
Unlike other fraternities that have 
already established their politics and 
leadership, members of the emerging 
ZBT chapter have freedom to pursue 
what they wish, said Lerner. “We’re on 
the same level,” he said.
Before becoming a chapter, the group 
must form a colony of 15 members. 
Mann hopes to accomplish this goal by 
the end of the year. If fall rush goes well 
next semester, Mann looks to rent out a 
house. Until then, the brothers plan on 
holding meetings and planning activi­
ties to attract members.
Even though existing fraternities have 
the advantage of financial stability over 
ZBT, it’s not an uphill battle for Mann. 
“Once we get past the whole colony 
stage ... the benefit will be unbeliev­
able,” he said. “In the end, it’ll definitely 
pay off.”
Mann emphasized ZBT’s tight alumni 
network as a major benefit for job-seek­
ers fresh out of college.
ZBT is the oldest, largest historically 
Jewish national fraternity. Speaking of 
the integration of secular Jews into

Professor makes model 
for less expensive wine
by Steven Spurgeon
Staffwriter
Turning water into wine? 
Not quite, but a CMU pro­
fessor may soon be able to 
create $500 flavor in a $10 
bottle of newly-fermented 
wine.
Working in conjunc­
tion with the Pontifical 
Catholic University (PCU) 
in Santiago, Chile, chemi­
cal engineering profes­
sor Lorenz Biegler is 
currently modeling the 
yeast process using com­
puters here at CMU. 
One possible byproduct 
of his research may be 
better-tasting, cheaper 
wine.
Biegler joined the project 
in 2002 when Dr. Ricardo 
Correa of PCU approached 
him for his help.
“He came to visit over 
the summer and told 
me about his work,” 
he said. “We started 
discussing optimization, 
and that’s how things 
started.”
Traditionally, the deter­
mining factor of a wine’s 
taste is its age: Over time, 
wines mellow and become
more fruity. This is due to 
the interplay of tannins, sul­
fites, and acids unique to 
each vintage.
How a wine will age, 
though, depends not only 
on the vines from which it 
is grown, but also on com­
plex chemical reactions that 
occur in.the yeast process. 
Sometimes the reactions 
can go awry, halting, 
fermentation.
“Dr. Correa told me that 
some of the wineries in 
Santiago were having prob­
lems with fermentation, and 
that last year 40 percent 
of the fermentations were 
lost because of stoppages,” 
Biegler said.
Biegler believes that by 
modeling fermentation, 
these reactions can be better 
controlled and made more 
reliable. His goal is “to even­
tually control inputs, such 
as sugar or temperature,” 
in the hopes of regulating 
outputs, improving taste, 
and reducing manufacturing 
waste.
Much of his past work has 
involved system modeling, 
and he says that his current 
interest is with mathematical

U.S. Secretary of Commerce Carlos Gutierrez spoke at CMU’s Collaborative Innovation Center last Friday. In his 
speech, Gutierrez praised Carnegie Mellon for its innovation in launching start-up companies.

Three days after President 
George W. Bush announced a new 
initiative to keep the United States 
competitive in a global economy, 
one of his top officials came to 
town to discuss how Carnegie 
Mellon can be a part of it.
Commerce Secretary Carlos 
M. Gutierrez visited CMU’s 
Collaborative Innovation 
Center on Friday to promote
the American Competitiveness 
Initiative, announced by Bush 
during his State of the Union 
address last Tuesday night.
“To keep America competitive, 
one commitment is necessary 
above all: We must continue to 
lead the world in human talent 
and creativity,” the President 
said in his address. “Our great­
est advantage in the world has 
always been our educated, hard­
working, ambitious people — and 
we’re going to keep that edge.”
Gutierrez summed up the
initiative’s purpose in the begin­
ning of his speech. “The idea is 
to encourage innovation through­
out our economy, [to] encourage 
everyone to get excited about 
innovating, about creating 
new things, and ... about 
refocusing on math and science 
education,” he said.
Research in nanotechnology, 
hydrogen, and quantum informa­
tion will be specifically targeted, 
Gutierrez said.

ily by University of Pittsburgh police for offenses such as stolen 
traffic and parking signs. Meanwhile, a pack of mounted police 
stayed behind, the riot barricade in case more serious offenses 
ensued.
Pittsburgh had been prepared for any riotous behavior since 
Friday. Targeted areas included the South Side, the North Side, 
and Oakland. Police helicopters kept Oakland in sight for the 
majority of last night. Furthermore, 12 extra corrections offi­
cers were placed on duty last night at the Allegheny County 
prison in case an influx of arrested individuals should occur, 
and police increased the expected riot zone.

Recently, 200 baby dolls and one 
professor got naked to support some
¦ trees that may be removed for con­
struction of the new Gates Center for 
Computer Science. The center of the 
conflict brewing around the new plan is 
the removal of a grove of trees between 
the Purnell Center and Doherty Hall.
“Right now the campus has embarked 
on a major and massive recreation of the 
West Campus quad,” said Ralph Horgan, 
associate vice provost of Campus Design 
and Facilities Management. According 
to Horgan, the largest problem facing 
the new design process is the 90-foot 
drop between the Cut and the planned 
site for the Gates building.
Horgan’s goal is to create an open 
space that allows for visibility of the 
new building and also develops some 
unity for the first time between the 
upper and lower sections.
Separating the two spaces is a wooded 
area that is familiar to many students, 
especially art students taking Eco-Art or 
Environmental Sculpture with art pro­
fessor Bob Bingham. The area is often 
filled with student sculptures, includ­
ing a current piece featuring about 200 
plastic baby dolls.
Sophomore art student Teresa Chen 
tied the dolls to the trees to protest a 
plan to change the site. Chen and some 
of her fellow art students don’t like the 
idea of removing the projects or the 
space as an area available for installing 
projects.
“There’s artwork in [the grove],” said 
first-year drama student Peter Albrink. 
“And it’s not a good thing that the 
artwork’s coming down for another 
building.”
Over winter break, workers removed 
some trees next to Doherty Hall in order

From January 1994 to Janu­

fiscal issues.
During his mayoral term, 
Murphy saw the creation of 
PNC Park, Heinz Field, and the 
David L. Lawrence Convention 
Center. After the region’s vot­
ers rejected a plan to fund the 
construction with a 0.5 percent
sales tax, Murphy created an 
$800 million plan that included 
Regional Asset District tax 
funds, state grants, a hotel levy, 
and private funds.
“The strategy was to grow 
Pittsburgh out of its budget 
problem,” stated Rich Lord 
in the Post-Gazette. But while 
Pittsburgh added $5 billion in 
taxable property values, the 
city only witnessed an increase 
of $7 million a year in property 
taxes.
Murphy beat current mayor 
Bob O’Connor in the 2001 
primaries but announced in De­
cember 2004 that he would not 
seek a fourth term.

As this week’s article reports, the 
Undergraduate Student Senate ad­
opted a resolution supporting the cur­
rent version of the proposed Student 
Rights Policy — a policy with some sig­
nificant problems — with a marginal 
vote. Nine senators voted in favor of the 
resolution, seven voted against, eight 
abstained, and five were missing in ac­
tion. Anyone who believes that Senate 
has acted with the will of the student 
body is deluding himself.
Eight Senators — one third of those 
present — abstained on what was 
arguably the single most significant 
and controversial vote of the year. 
In remaining neutral, the abstaining 
Senators revealed something about 
themselves: Either they haven’t made 
the effort to make a decision or they’re 
not courageous enough to take a stand 
on a controversial issue. Either way, 
they do their constituencies a great dis­
service.
Having the choice to abstain is criti­
cal; when responsible representatives 
have a conflict of interest, they abstain 
from voting in order to maintain their 
integrity. For many in Senate, on the 
other hand, abstention is the best way 
to avoid making a decision — it’s the 
easy way out.
As if abusing abstention weren’t 
enough, only 24 out of 29 Senators 
bothered to show up at the meeting. 
Meanwhile, eight Senate seats remain 
vacant — that is, about one out of 
five undergraduates is underrepre­
sented in the Undergraduate Student 
Senate.
In short, the representatives of one 
quarter of the student body have spo­
ken for all of us. Frankly, my confidence 
in the Undergraduate Student Senate, 
cracked already, has been shattered.
Now, the resolution is in the hands 
of our student body president, Tom Sa- 
bram, who has the power to veto. A veto 
would mean that Senate would need a 
two-thirds majority to adopt the reso­
lution supporting the proposed policy. 
Sabram has told me that he’s frustrated 
by the way this resolution was adopted. 
Now, he can be confident in using his 
authority. By vetoing, Sabram can 
show what it means to be decisive and 
dedicated to accurately representing 
students. I hope he will send the reso­
lution back to the Undergraduate Stu­
dent Senate and ask that they secure a 
two-thirds vote before passing the reso­
lution.
I am proud to say that both of my 
representatives — the Senators for 
the interdisciplinary programs, Justin 
Berka and Andrea Hamilton — voted 
meaningfully and in the negative.
The Student Rights Policy has no 
value; it adds nothing to existing policy. 
There is robust language already pro­
tecting the rights of students to be 
graded appropriately. University Policy 
states, “The power that teachers wield 
in the classroom must be exercised with 
the greatest possible care for maintain­
ing fairness, which means examining 
classroom practice for any hidden 
assumptions which might produce con­
fusion or partiality.”
Furthermore, University Policy gives 
a very clear “Procedure for the Appeal 
of Grades and Academic Action,” so 
students have a clear and potent rem­
edy if they feel they have been treated 
unfairly.
According to Mike Bueti, chair of 
the Academic Affairs committee and 
sponsor of the resolution, the policy 
is intended to clarify and make more 
accessible policies already stated in 
The Word. But adding more policy in 
the same place as the other policy just 
makes no sense.
At best, the proposal would do 
nothing. At worst — and this is a likely 
scenario — it would encourage mali­
cious conservative activists who are 
trying to scare legislators into believing 
that there is a “liberal bias” in universi­
ties across the country.
With any luck, our misguided rep­
resentatives will get their act together 
and address the issues, rather than 
closing their eyes and hoping nobody 
notices them.

Students, faculty gather to discuss diversity
by Claire Morgenstern
Staffwnter
Are students tired of talking 
about the role diversity should 
play in their college experience? 
Not all of them.
-Last Wednesday, undergradu­
ate and graduate students alike 
joined faculty, staff, and members 
of the Board of Trustees at a 
town hall meeting to discuss the 
“Student State of Diversity.”
.For 90 minutes, participants 
discussed what a diverse cultural 
climate on campus should look 
like. They wondered how to get 
students in segregated groups to 
interact and under what circum­
stances the interaction should 
occur.
~ The meeting served as a follow- 
up to President Jared Cohon’s 
annual “State of Diversity” speech 
in honor of Martin Luther King 
Day. Student Body Vice President 
Nicolette Louissaint moderated, 
vyith the help of Student Body 
President Tom Sabram.
Louissaint began by referring 
to the statistics Cohon mentioned
in his speech. “A lot of the conver­
sations we have about diversity 
are about the numbers and how 
proud we are of them,” she said. 
“We want to talk abut what we’re 
doing with the numbers and how 
they affect us.”
Participants debated how to 
create a diversity training pro­
gram and how to foster more 
interaction between minority 
groups socially and academically. 
Analyzing why students are dis­
inclined to diversify, participants 
reasoned that many students 
aren’t exposed to diversity prior 
to arriving on campus. They also 
speculated that students place 
the responsibility on others to 
make the first move and use the 
academic rigor of the institution 
as an excuse not to take an active 
role in making connections.
But, as some participants won­
dered, are we placing too much 
emphasis on creating a perfect 
microcosm of diversity on cam­
pus? For board member Lowell 
Steinbrenner, diversity has 
become “too heavy a burden.” He 
said that “diversity is a means, 
not an end.”
It appears some University 
officials agree. The January 26 
issue of the Chronicle of Higher 
Education named Carnegie 
Mellon’s Summer Academy for 
Mathematics and Science as one 
of “Five Programs That Opened 
Their Doors To All Races.” 
Formerly named the Summer 
Academy for Minority Scholars, 
the program became open to all 
races beginning last summer. 
The program prepares minor­
ity students to pursue degrees in 
science and engineering.
“I think diversity is natural,” 
said Everett Tademy, director 
of CMU’s Equal Opportunity 
Services and secretary of the 
Diversity Advisory Council. “I 
think it’s what we are.”
The primary purpose of 
Wednesday’s meeting was to 
create practical ways to take 
advantage of the diversity of 
races, ethnicities, interests, ideas, 
and perspectives that are repre­
sented on campus.
The group pointed to other 
mandatory programs, such as 
CSW and AlcoholEdu, to assess 
the potential pros and cons of
a mandatory diversity course. 
They praised events like UC 
Fridays that bring the whole 
campus together on a social 
level.
“We need to make it so that 
students are not only open to, 
but value differences in other 
people,” one faculty member 
said. He suggested initiating 
more group academic projects, 
giving students the opportunity 
to gain more perspectives and 
ideas from people with different 
backgrounds.
• No matter what, the group 
concluded, unless there is a way 
to impart to students all the ben­
efits that diversity can bring, 
there is no way to force interac­
tion upon them.
“We look for reasons not to try 
things because it might not be 
the solution,” one staff partici­
pant said. “And it probably isn’t
— but we’re closer to finding the 
solution.”
Student government and 
the Division of Student Affairs 
co-sponsored the event, which 
kicked off February’s Black 
History Month events.
Professor’s program could reduce price of wine
Senate passes policy 
change with 1/3 vote
GMU professor Lorez Biegler created 
a:compUter model that could lead to 
-cheaper wine.
WINE, from Al
efficiency more than anything 
else. “It’s an optimization prob­
lem, and that’s what I’m con­
cerned with,” he said.
Modeling is already 
commonly employed in the 
petroleum and pharmaceutical 
industries to maintain quality 
control and cut costs.
However, it has made 
little inroads in the field 
of winemaking, due to the 
sheer complexity of the organic 
system.
“So far, most of the work has 
been in fitting models to data, 
rather than creating entire sys­
tems,” he said.
Modeling the yeast system is 
proving to be quite a challenge: 
A recent paper published by his 
group lists 40 simultaneous re­
actions — only a fraction of the 
true number.
Understanding the yeast
process will go a long way to­
ward improving the archaic 
and haphazard methods of 
quality control currently
• employed.
For instance, in California, it 
is common for grapes to be har­
vested later, and for water to 
be added during fermentation 
to regulate alcohol content. 
Other wineries routinely add 
sugar during fermentation 
to sustain the process and im­
prove taste.
Biegler is confident that his 
team will be able to unravel the 
chain of reactions, helping win­
eries around the world more 
effectively control the different 
steps of fermentation.
System optimization is noth­
ing new to Biegler, who last year 
helped the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture create a network 
for monitoring contaminants in 
bodies of water.
“The problem in this system
is that there are thousands of 
nodes,” he said, pointing to a 
diagram of a municipal water 
network.
In fermentation the situ­
ation is similar, as there are 
hundreds of simultaneous 
reactions that must be ac­
counted for.
To analyze large volumes of 
data, Biegler and his colleague 
Correa developed software 
based on the well-known pack­
age Matlab.
IBM has taken over future 
development of CMU’s software, 
while Correa’s contributions 
have been made available 
online for other researchers to 
use.
Biegler’s two-year collabo­

In a vote that narrowly passed, 
Student Senate approved a reso­
lution last Thursday in support 
of the proposed amendment to 
the Student Rights Policy. In its 
revised form the amendment 
reads, “The third right of stu­
dents is to have their work eval­
uated based 
on stated 
course and 
program 
criteria and 
appropriate 
knowledge 
of the sub­
jects and dis­
ciplines they 
study, as 
outlined by 
the relevant 
faculty.”
Existing 
University 
Policy 
addresses 
the issues 
of “Mutual 
Trust and 
Respect” and 
“Fairness 
and Exem­
plary Be­
havior” is 
its section 
titled “Goals,
Rights, and Responsibilities.”
The Academic Affairs 
Committee reworked the 
amendment’s wording after 
concerns were raised at a forum 
held last semester. Drafters 
of the original amendment 
used language from conserva­
tive activist David Horowitz’s 
Student Bill of Rights.
The resolution is another 
in many steps that former 
chair of Student Senate’s 
Academic Affairs commit­
tee Long Pham and cur­
rent chair Michael Bueti 
have taken in the long and 
arduous process of making 
the amendment University 
Policy. The President’s Council 
makes the ultimate decision 
on changes to University Policy.
Only 24 Senators out of 29 
were in attendance on Thursday, 
which raised many concerns 
among those who were there. 
Nine Senators voted in favor 
of the resolution, seven were 
against it, and eight voted 
abstention.
Junior Joseph Arasin, a com­
puter science and history major 
who serves as a member of the 
Academic Affairs committee, 
was disap­
pointed in the 
disproportion­
ate number 
of Senators 
abstaining. 
“A Senator 
should only 
abstain from a 
vote when he 
or she has a 
personal con­
flict of interest 
regarding the 
motion,” he 
said.
The close 
vote was
indicative of 
the heated
debate among 
the Senators. 
“There defi­
nitely was dis­
agreement,” 
said Arasin, 
“but no hostil­
ity.”
As per Student Senate bylaws, 
Student Body President Tom 
Sabram, a senior in chemical 
engineering, has 120 hours to 
veto the resolution. In an e-mail, 
Sabram responded, “I believe 
this resolution is premature and 
should have been tabled.... I am 
still unsure if I will pursue any 
further action.”
“If Tom feels that students were 
inadequately or inaccurately rep­
resented due to the abstentions, 
he should veto the motion,” said 
Arasin. “If he felt that Thursday’s 
vote was a valid representation, 
then he shouldn’t veto.”
Bueti and Student Senate chair 
Julie Beckenstein could not be 
reached for comment.

U.S. Secretary of Commerce speaks at CMU
“What’s being done here at 
Carnegie Mellon ... is a big part of 
our advantage as a nation.”
— Carlos Gutierrez, U.S. Secretary of Commerce
Students plan 
to bring back 
ZBT fraternity
ZBT, from A1
campus life, Mann feels ZBT means more 
than just future prospects. “It fills a void,” 
he said.
Warshaver explained that the bonding 
process of beginning a fraternity is greater 
than joining one already established. He 
also thought it important to make ZBT a 
fraternity that isn’t religiously exclusive.
First-year Justin Moidel is in the frater- 
nity-browsing process. For Moidel, it is 
important to find a fraternity that embrac­
es his Jewish heritage in such ways as serv­
ing kosher meals. At the same time, he’s 
looking for a fraternity that is welcoming 
of others. After attending ZBT’s meeting, 
Moidel thought ZBT might do just that. 
“[ZBT] would be a Jewish fraternity that 
would not be exclusive,” he said.
“As the founding fathers, we’re taking a 
risk,” said Mann. “[But] the benefit will far 
outweigh the risk.”
SECRETARY, from A1
In explaining how America can boost 
its advantage in the global economy, 
Gutierrez echoed much of the rationale 
Bush presented on Tuesday night.
“One of the things that we need to 
understand ... is that we can’t.innovate 
and grow, and at the same time retreat 
from the world,” he said.
Like Bush, he also stressed the impor­
tance of open markets, affordable health 
care, and new energy sources.
Gutierrez, a native of Cuba who 
came to the U.S. with his family at 
the age of seven, drew a link between 
American ingenuity and immigration 
policy.
“We also need to recognize that our 
tradition of immigration and assimila­
tion is a distinct competitive advan­
tage,” he said.
“You’ve seen in other countries 
around the world how much trouble 
they’ve had with assimilating immi­
gration, with just enabling immi­
grants to fit in and form part of the
fabric of society. We know how to do 
that; we’ve been doing it for over 200 
years.”
Gutierrez acknowledged that 
America’s multinational workforce pro­
vides an edge over other countries that 
have more homogeneous populations. 
“Immigration brings new ideas, new 
innovations, and new energy into our 
economy, and I see it right here in this 
university,” the secretary said.
Noting that Bush’s announcement 
had “excited the entire technology sec­
tor,” University president Jared Cohon 
discussed CMU’s strengths in a more 
general way, focusing on the University’s
reputation for conducting research.
“This university has very, much 
embraced ... the idea in particular that 
the key for America’s continuing suc­
cess has to be building on our strengths 
and being the best we can be when it 
comes to developing new products and 
new ideas,” Cohon said.
The secretary’s visit here included 
a number of technological demonstra­
tions, showcasing CMU’s work in a vari­
ety of scientific domains.
Noting that CMU research projects 
have launched more than 70 start­
up companies, Gutierrez stressed the 
importance of being able to transform
new ideas and concepts into viable com­
mercial products.
“What’s being done here at Carnegie 
Mellon — the fact that there are busi­
nesses here sponsoring some of these 
projects, the fact that you’re using some 
government grants — that linkage and 
that teamwork, we believe, is a big part 
of our advantage as a nation,” he said.
Gutierrez said he was impressed with 
the University’s display of talent and 
research ideas.
“I think it’s just impossible to spend 
time here and not walk out feeling 
optimistic about the future of our coun­
try,” he said. “You are really setting an 
example of what can be done and why it 
is that we’re going to have a great, great 
21st century.”
Yun Seong Song, a graduate stu­
dent in mechanical engineering, was 
encouraged by the secretary’s positive 
response.
“The fact that he’s really interested 
in technology, especially at CMU, helps 
the University’s image,” Song told the 
Pittsburgh Tribune Review.
Students protest removal of trees between Purnell and Doherty
ing lot at the bottom of the hill, 
and Pittsburgh Sewer and Water 
warns that the old structures may 
not be able to support new build­
ings and landscapes.
Discussion of the several 
conflicts involved will continue 
tomorrow when the Campus 
Design and Facility Development 
department will meet with land­
scape architects and Bingham 
to discuss the design for the 
grove of trees and also the rain 
garden.
Connecting the upper and 
lower campuses is also a con­
cern of both Campus Design and 
students. “It’Ys unfortunate that 
they have to cut it down,” said 
sophomore art student Spenzor 
Longo, “but to make the campus 
itself function better, it can be 
seen, I think, as a positive thing.”
Nevertheless, it is a plan that 
Ralph Horgan wishes to tackle. 
“The vision is bold, the vision is 
big,” he said. “And I think from 
my perspective, the vision is 
right for where this campus is 
today and where it wants to 
grow.”The trees in the grove between Purnell and Doherty will be removed as part of the Gates building construction. 
One art student placed nearly 200 baby dolls in the grove in protest.
TREES, from A1
to perform renovations to accom­
modate a new wing of chemical 
engineering classrooms, a new 
elevator and stairwell, and heat­
ing and cooling ducts. Seeing the 
removal of the trees, Bingham 
climbed and hugged the biggest 
of the trees wearing nothing 
but the hard hat required in the 
demolition zone.
“My heart just sunk,” Bingham 
said, recalling when he saw work­
ers with chainsaws cutting down 
the trees.
“I went and got my hard hat 
on, and as I was walking back out 
I realized, I just have to do it. So 
I, you know, took my clothes off. I 
had my hard hat on.”
After Bingham shimmied up the 
biggest of the trees, the embar­
rassed workers backed off.
Bingham sees Campus Design’s 
plans to remove the trees as 
conflicting. “I’m supposed to be 
teaching environmental literacy 
to students and they come in and 
do things like this,” he said.
Though part of the Gates con­
struction, the removal of the 
remaining trees hits close to 
home for many students on cam­
pus who feel a personal connec­
tion to the area.
“I think [the trees are] good 
for the campus,” said Elena 
Goldstein, a sophomore environ­
mental engineering student.
Likewise, the trees have an 
important environmental effect, 
as outlined in another art proj­
ect that designated the area 
the Carnegie Nature Reserve. 
According to a large sign at the 
bottom of the grove, the area is 
comprised mostly of honey locust 
trees, a species that retain water 
well, helping to prevent flooding 
and erosion.
Bingham has proposed an alter­
nate plan of installing a rain gar­
den down the hill along the edge 
of the Purnell Center. The garden 
would be another example of bio­
logical engineering at work and 
would also help with flooding in 
Pittsburgh.
However, the plan is still up 
in the air. Some 100-year-old 
sewer pipes run under the park-

Taking the EOC by the reins:
The Tartan’s one-stop tip guide i Haseeb Quareshi & Greg Hanneman
will be stationed throughout the University 
Center’s Rangos Ballroom and Wiegand 
Gymnasium from 1 to 6 pm.
Participating companies include Allstate 
Insurance, Amazon, Compunetix, Expedia, 
IBM, Maya Design, Mellon Financial, and 
Toyota.
Unlike the fall’s Business Opportuni­
ties Conference, which catered to business 
and economics students, or the Technical 
Opportunities Conference, which focused 
on engineering and computer science, the 
EOC is a career fair for students from all col­
leges. Whether you are seeking an intern­
ship or full-time employment, the EOC can 
assist in your endeavor.
The Career Center recommends that par­
ticipating students dress in business profes­
sional attire, bring several copies of their 
resume, and wear nametags on the right 
lapel of their suit jackets. Pre-registered 
students can pick up their nametags from 
9 am to 6 pm in UC Wean Commons. Not 
pre-registered? Don’t worry — you can 
register on Thursday and receive a hand­
written nametag.
To prepare for the EOC, students can at­
tend the Career Center workshop “Prepar­
ing for Job Fairs” today in UC Rangos 3 
from 4:30 to 5:30 pm.
Students in the College of Fine Arts, don’t 
despair — there is a college fair specifically 
for arts students on Tuesday, February 21. 
This year’s annual CFA job and internship 
fair, “Making A Living, Living Your Dream 
2006,” bring together students and em­
ployers in all artistic fields, including art, 
architecture, design, arts administration, 
theater, and music.
Interested students should register 
with the Career Center by Wednesday 
February 15.
In the meantime, the EOC is a great op­
portunity to network, spread your resum6, 
and gain valuable experience in a pro­
fessional setting. In this guide, we have 
collected some tips and tricks to help you 
get the most out of this amazing resource. 
So practice your handshake, refine your re­
sume, and read up.Haseeb Quareshi/Assistant Business Manager
Prepare yourself
n/> make sure you are well- 
groomed and are wear­
ing appropriate attire. You’ll be 
briefly meeting recruiters, so how 
you present yourself will be an 
important part of the impression 
you make on them. Guys, a clean 
shave and haircut are essential. 
Also, a well-tied tie, clean shirt, 
and pressed suit are 
important in job 
fairs. For girls, a 
nicely pressed 
suit and a 
tasteful top 
make for 
an impres- 
s i o n a b 1 e 
image. And 
for both guys 
and girls, wear 
clothes in which 
you feel comfort­
able and self-confident.
flnn*!1 spend time criticiz- 
ing or disparaging 
your previous employment. It is 
almost certain that you will be 
asked about your past work ex­
perience, and you don’t want to 
answer with a long tirade about 
how your former boss had the IQ 
of a jar of mayonnaise. When dis­
cussing old jobs that didn’t 
work out,' it’s better to 
concentrate on what 
you learned from the 
experience or how it 
helped refine your 
long-term employ­
ment goals. Your 
less-than-perfect 
work history can 
also be useful fod­
der for the dreaded 
“Tell me about a time 
when things didn’t go as 
you’d planned” question.
Present yourself
II look up some informa- 
tion about the company 
you will be interviewing with. 
This can be as simple as 
visiting the compa­
ny’s website and 
browsing through 
it. Find out how 
the organiza­
tion is divided, 
and learn about 
the functions 
of each one. Try 
to absorb some 
of the company’s 
culture, and then ask 
specific questions about it 
during the interview. You don’t 
need to show the recruiter that 
you’re a walking encyclope­
dia, but displaying some back­
ground knowledge expresses 
that you care enough about the 
interview to prepare for it.
Don’tgive recruiters a 
dead-fish hand­
shake. Nothing 
spells bad first im­
pression like a 
floppy 
greeting. 
A hand- 
shake 
can tell 
recruiters 
volumes 
— how
confident 
you are, how 
excited you
are to be talking to 
them, and how well you might 
fit in. A firm handshake and di­
rect eye contact will go a long 
way toward helping your case. 
Don’t be intimidated — these 
people want to pay you lots of 
money to work for them.
Act professional
11« make sure you have busi- 
ness cards and plenty of 
resumes prepared. The last thing 
you need is for recruiters to mis­
read your poor handwriting on 
interest forms and mailing lists. 
A business card can save 
you time and help you 
hit more recruit­
ers faster. Don’t 
overdo it, though; 
being too eager 
to hand them 
out might make 
you look cocky.
A fine-tuned and 
error-free resume 
is a must; be sure 
to stop by the Career 
Center today at 3 pm to go 
to their information session, or 
schedule an independent meet­
ing with your career center rep­
resentative.
nnn^ sit off on the side 
of the room gossip­
ing with your friends. Save the 
small talk and the tales of who 
got drunk last weekend for when 
you get back to your residence 
hall or apartment. 
You’re here to find 
a job, and you 
never know 
who might 
overhear 
something. 
As laid-back 
as some 
companies 
purport to be, 
none of them 
have much inter­
est in hiring someone 
they expect to throw back a 
few Iron Citys over lunch break. 
Keep it professional and you’ll ap­
preciate it later.
At a school nationally ranked for its ca­
reer placement, Carnegie Mellon students

farther than the University Center.

Lawsuit filed against 
Grand Theft Auto
The Grand Theft Auto video 
game franchise recently ran 
into trouble when Los Angeles 
city attorney Rocky Delgadillo 
filed a lawsuit against Rockstar 
Games and Take-Two Interac­
tive, the game’s parent compa­
nies. Hidden content, including 
pornographic and adult-only 
material, sparked the lawsuit. 
Delgadillo claims the companies 
engaged in misleading market­
ing statements and competi­
tion by not fully disclosing game 
content. Its mature and often 
violent gameplay caused many 
retailers, including Wal-Mart and 
Best Buy, to pull the game from 
its inventory after the game’s 
Mature rating changed to Adults

Modern car turns 120
The 1886 Benz Motor Car pat­
ent by carmaker Karl Benz is con­
sidered the birth of the modern 
car era. The patent describes a 
“vehicle with gas operation,” fea­
turing modern engine designs, 
such as a single-cylinder, four- 
stroke engine; water-cooled 
radiators; and electric ignition. 
Gottlieb Daimler and Wilhelm 
Maybach demonstrated the first 
engine-driven carriage that year 
and formed the industry car­
maker Daimler-Benz. Daimler’s 
death in 1900 inspired Maybach 
to develop a world-class vehicle, 
named Mercedes, which became 
the benchmark for all modern car 
designs.

city of Philadelphia. The city was 
the first major metropolitan area 
to announce plans for free wire­
less Internet access. Low-cost 
service fees, starting at Earth- 
Link’s wholesale $9 price to retail 
Internet service providers, would 
allow poorer residents to access 
the Internet. The City Council 
reviews the contract this month, 
and construction begins immedi­
ately upon approval. Expect full, 
city-wide service by spring 2007.

Microsoft proposes 
cell phone solution
The Big M has stepped up the 
heat on the One Laptop Per Child 
program by introducing the idea 
of a program that utilizes cell 
phones as full computers. This 
move is in response to MIT’s 
Nicholas Negroponte’s $100 
laptop program, which targets 
the poorer nations of the world 
to increase access to technol­
ogy using the affordable laptop. 
Microsoft has begun to promote 
the idea of a smart phone that 
is more practical. Bill Gates’ big 
push comes in part from Negro­
ponte’s rejection of using the Win­
dows platform on his laptops and 
may allow Microsoft to become a 
major player in the cellular tele­
communications industry.

How Things Work: Birth Control Pills
An Insight into the Matsuoka lab
Introduction
by Hanadie Yousef
Science & Technology Editor
Welcome to one of SciTech’s 
two new sections: Research
Profiles. To help you get better 
acquainted with the exciting 
research being conducted right 
under your noses, the SciTech 
staff put together this section. 
This way, you may get a better 
sense of the kind of research or 
profession you might want to get 
into after college or the kind of 
undergrad research you might 
want to pursue here at CMU.
This week and next, SciTech 
will be featuring the Robotics 
Institute. Dr. Yoky Matsuoka 
is an assistant professor in 
the Robotics Institute. Her lab 
focuses on research and develop­
ment in neural control of move­
ment, brain-machine interface, 
and devices for rehabilitation, 
motor enhancement, and enter­
tainment.
The research projects de­
scribed in this feature are 
amazing — the Matsuoka lab 
is standing at the crossroads of 
biology and technology, making 
technological devices that will 
enhance human life. To be able 
to use robotics to enhance hu­
man sensory and neurological 
systems seems almost imaginary, 
like something out of science fic­
tion.
This research would not be 
possible if it did not incorpo­
rate the knowledge and skills 
of multiple disciplines. “In the 
Neurobotics lab we aim to help
patients with neurological injury 
through robotic rehabilitation, 
direct neural interface, and 
neurally-based prosthetic con­
trol. This involves the collabora­
tion of electical, mechanical, and 
biomedical engineers; medical 
doctors; and many others,” said 
Pedram Afshar, an MD/PhD stu­
dent in the Neurobotics lab.
“People who do best are those 
that want to learn more about 
other disciplines. They can really 
integrate each other’s knowl­
edge,” said Mike Vande Weghe, 
a research programmer. “Even if 
no one person has the necessary 
skills, having the curiosity to be 
open and learn from people with 
other skills makes it much more 
fun. You get much more out of it. 
Sometimes you don’t know how 
well you know something until 
you have to explain it — this lab 
has really shown me that.”
The research being conducted 
in this lab is very promising for 
patients with physical disabili­
ties. As Matsuoka put it, “My 
work will allow disabled and 
elderly people to live richer and 
more independent lives. Those 
who have physical paralysis will 
be rehabilitated under virtual 
robotic environment. Those who 
cannot be rehabilitated will be 
provided with assistive devices 
that allow them to reach and 
manipulate objects better. Those 
with primitive prosthetic devices 
may be given an opportunity to 
use much more natural replace­
ment of their limbs. Maybe those 
disabled and elderly people can 
one day participate in sports or 
go back to work where it wouldn’t 
have been possible without the
Above is the Anatomically Correct Testbed Hand (ACTH). Begun in 2002, the development of the ACTH 
will serve as a model to better understand the coordination of the hand via brain signaling.

repetitive movements of robotic therapy with visual feedback distortion.
neurobotics technology.”
Read on to find out more about 
the various technologies being 
developed in the Matsuoka lab.
Neurobotics Laboratory
by Saravana Sivasankaran
Junior Staffwriter
CMU’s Neurobotics Labora­
tory focuses primarily on build­
ing robot-human closed-loop 
systems that alter the neural 
control of movement as a way 
to rehabilitate, assist, and en­
hance human motor control and 
learning capabilities. The benefi­
ciaries of the research that goes 
on here are people with strokes, 
spinal cord injuries, traumatic 
brain injuries, and other inju­
ries that inhibit daily activities. 
Besides these, the Neurobotics 
Laboratory’s work also has ap­
plications in sports medicine, the 
military, and entertainment.
Currently, efforts are focused 
on developing a passive reha­
bilitation device to help stroke 
patients. The idea behind such 
a device stems from the fact that 
neural pathways will start to 
regrow after an accident or time 
of dormancy if they are stimu­
lated. Stroke patients tend to give 
up using the affected body part. 
Doing so, however, could dramat­
ically increase the time it takes 
to recover from the stroke. “In­
stead of people learning to work 
around a disability and never re­
gaining control, this device will 
help them to regain functionality.
Their recovery would be sped up 
by a safe, passive robot that could 
guide them,” said Wegh.
This device would tie in with 
the ongoing Feedback Distor­
tion for Rehabilitation project, 
which combines the repetitive 
movements of robotic therapy 
with visual feedback distor­
tion. Simply speaking, when an 
individual performs a task re­
peatedly, his or her performance 
on a given attempt is predicted 
largely by the previous perfor­
mance. If feedback received by 
the individual • is distorted so 
that the level of performance 
appears less than the level pre­
viously achieved, the individual 
will improve performance until 
the feedback indicates that the 
previous performance level has 
been reached.
The lab’s current projects also 
include Sensory Transfer Sys­
tems for the Sensory Impaired. 
The purpose of this project is 
to construct a sensory transfer 
system to assist and enhance 
the manipulation abilities of the 
sensory impaired. This system 
consists of two parts — an array 
of sensors worn on the arm and 
an array of actuators worn on the 
face or neck. The system senses 
the pressure exerted on the hand 
by various objects and transfers 
that pressure to a location from 
which a patient still receives sen­
sory information.
The Silicon/Neuron Interface 
is another project that focuses on 
creating chronically implantable 
neural interfaces that may be
used to control external devices 
and replace lost sensory input. 
Research currently focuses on 
conductive polymer coatings, to 
promote more intimate connec­
tions between cells and metal 
electrodes, that could eventually 
lead to a device that would be 
safe for long-term use and that 
would produce low-noise chronic 
single-unit recording.
Researchers working for the 
Neurobotics lab are also working 
to gain a better understanding of 
neuromuscular control. One way 
of doing this is through reading 
electrical signals from the brain 
and doing experiments to bet­
ter understand how the brain 
manages motor control. In this 
regard, Alik Widge has been 
working on the development of 
biologically-friendly materials 
that make up the neuron detec­
tors. These detectors can serve 
as bi-directional transmitters, al­
lowing the user to read incoming 
electrical signals from the body 
and also send electrical signals of 
their own.
Pedram Afshar’s research into 
understanding how -the brain 
controls the human hand uses a 
different method with the same 
underlying principles. “I am 
working on the neural control of 
movement project,” Afshar said. 
“My research has two goals: (1) 
figure out how the brain solves 
the problem of human hand con­
trol and (2) design engineering 
strategies for brain controlled 
hand prosthetics.”

According to research done 
by the National Center for 
Health Statistics, 53 percent 
of women aged 15 to 24 that 
use forms of pregnancy pre­
vention choose to use birth 
control pills.
There is more to a birth con­
trol pill than just a circle of 
color. Each pill contains a spe­
cial ingredient. When it is taken 
every day, the birth control 
pill has the power to prevent a 
woman from becoming preg­
nant. How can birth control 
pills possibly prevent the fertil­
ization of an egg?
Normally, pregnancy occurs 
when an egg in the uterus is 
fertilized by a man’s sperm. The 
pill prevents ovulation by fool­
ing the body into believing that 
it is pregnant.
During menstruation, the 
pituitary gland secretes follicle- 
stimulating hormone (FSH) 
and luteinizing hormones (LH) 
in response to gonadotropin- 
releasing hormone (GnRH) 
from the hypothalamus. FSH 
stimulates growth of the fol­
licles, the cells in the ovary that 
release the egg. This in turn 
stimulates the secretion of the 
hormone estrogen. As estrogen 
levels rise, there is an increase in 
LH concentration, which causes 
ovulation — the release of the 
egg. The levels of estrogen and 
the progesterone hormone rise, 
-------------------<----------------
21, days contain the active pills, 
or the hormones. If the tablets 
are arranged in three different 
colors, each color indicates the 
different amounts of hormones 
in each pill. The last seven tab­
lets contain iron or an inactive 
ingredient. They are not birth 
control pills and serve the pur-, 
pose of continuing the cycle of 
taking a pill each day. Menstru­
ation occurs during the period 
of these seven days.
There are other types of birth 
control pills. In a 21-tablet 
packet, one pill is taken daily 
for 21 days. There is also a 91- 
day tablet packet. Another type 
of birth control is the minipill, 
which contains no estrogen. It 
inhibits the egg’s ability to travel 
through the fallopian tubes, 
prevents the sperm from travel­
ing up the cervix, and therefore 
suppresses the sperm’s ability 
to unite with an egg.
There are many advantages 
to birth control pills. They 
gready decrease menstrual 
cramps and reduce blood loss 
and PMS symptoms. Plus, at 
a young woman’s age, it isn’t 
time to be worrying about preg­
nancy. But birth control pills 
also carry many disadvantages, 
which include the expenses for 
the pills, possible side effects of 
headaches or depression, and 
having to remember to take the 
pill every day.
Bottom line: Choose wisely 
and be safe!
which in turn inhibit the secre­
tion of FSH and LH.
The birth control pill con­
tains hormones that work 
with the body’s natural hor­
mones to prevent pregnancy 
by putting a stop to ovulation. 
It suppresses the natural hor­
mones in the body that would 
stimulate the release of an egg. 
The most common pill, called 
the combination pill, consists 
of the hormones estrogen and 
progesterone. These synthetic 
hormones negatively feed 
back to the pituitary gland and 
inhibit the normal cyclic pro- 
----j----------------------------
duction of hormones that stim­
ulate ovulation.
Estrogen stimulates the 
pituitary gland to produce 
a hormone called prolactin. 
Prolactin inhibits the release 
of GnRH, which halts the se-, 
cretion of LH and FSH. These 
hormones are responsible for 
ovulation, so prolactin effec­
tively prevents the release of 
the egg. If there are no eggs to 
be fertilized, pregnancy is im­
possible. Progesterone thickens 
the cervical mucus, hinder­
ing the movement of sperm, 
and prevents the uterus’s lin- 
—>
ing from developing normally, 
making implantation of an egg 
very unlikely.
Birth control pills also result 
in lighter periods due to excess 
progesterone. The progesterone 
causes thinner uterine walls and 
thicker cervical walls, which 
make it difficult for sperm to 
travel. Both ovulation and the 
normal lining of the womb, 
which is normally meant to 
prepare for egg and sperm im­
plantation, are inhibited. When 
menstruation occurs, there is 
no excess lining to be shed.

Dr. Jeffrey Schwartz of the University 
of Pittsburgh and Dr. Bruno Maresca of 
the University of Salerno published a 
paper January 30 in the New Anatomist 
showing how the emerging understand­
ing of cell structure supports the Pitt 
professor’s theory of evolution.
In the beginning (1859), Darwin 
created evolutionary theory. This theory 
was based on the belief that organisms 
gradually evolve. The premise behind 
this theory was that living things evolved 
based on selection of the fittest, inheri­
tance, and variation. Darwin’s model 
of gradual evolution was Very limited 
in explaining novelty — simply put, the 
emergence of new things.
For this reason, Schwartz outlines the 
limits of Darwinism in his book Sudden 
Origins. If one looks at fossil records, 
there is little evidence supporting a 
gradual change. On the contrary, evolu­
tion is often a sudden occurrence, start­
ing on the cellular level. Animals did 
not gradually form teeth, for example; 
they were just there. In the same vein, 
it would be impossible to say that repro­
ductive organs gradually came about. 
These jumps cannot be accounted for 
through Darwinism. Darwinism does 
not account for how organisms came 
into being, just how organisms survive.
The last 20 years of evolutionary 
biology show that organisms share the 
same regulatory molecules. Accord­
ing to Schwartz, there is no change at 
the molecular level. Rather, provoking 
novel features is all a matter of the tim­
ing of shuffling cards. For instance, the 
same regulatory gene that accounts for 
certain segments of the brains of verte­
brates accounts for the spots on a certain 
butterfly.
This brings us to the research done by 
Maresca regarding stress proteins. There 
exists in the cell membrane a number of 
stress proteins that prevent mutations 
or possible errors from occurring.
The cell membrane’s physical state 
(MPS) depends on the cell’s ability to 
handle such errors. The cell’s compe­
tence is reliant on the temperature and/ 
or diet available to it.
In general, stress proteins are able to 
sustain a balance within five degrees of 
the given environment. If^ greater shift 
occurs, the stress proteins will most 
often become over-worked, resulting in 
the demise of the organism.
Plants are able to adapt to a change 
in temperature in about two months. If 
a sudden change occ\irs, however, the 
organism must rely on its heat shock 
response (HSR) to accommodate this 
change. If the sudden change is too 
much, the HSR is not able to cope and 
the MPS becomes too greatly disturbed, 
leading to the death of the organism.
An example of this would be a per­
son’s response to the change in weather. 
When a human is exposed to a slight 
change of temperature, it is unpleas­
ant for a while. However, after a couple 
months the body adapts to the weather

tion of a cell’s lipid membrane.
and it is then considered normal. If that 
same person were suddenly exposed 
to severe heat or cold, he or she would 
die shortly due to the body’s inability to 
cope with such drastic change.
Such phenomena lead to mutations,

Experiment of the week: neutron activation used for material analysis
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
Welcome to SciTech’s new “Ex­
periment of the Week” section. 
The science staff at The Tartan 
has noticed that a lot of excit­
ing science occurs at CMU and 
around the world that no one 
hears about. Our hard-working 
staffwriters hope to change that 
by featuring exciting experiments 
or research techniques that you’re 
probably not familiar with, from 
zero-gravity research aboard the 
“Vomit Comet” to NASA’s Grav­
ity Probe B to the Mars Science 
Laboratory’s neutron activation. 
In fact, neutron activation is the 
first topic in this series.
Deep in the bowels of Doherty 
Hall there is a small locked room. 
In this room is a barrel that 
contains a small amount of pluto­
nium. Plutonium may be the stuff 
of nuclear bombs, but it can also 
be used for neutron activation. 
This elegant physics technique 
is based on the idea that when 
atoms in any material are artifi­
cially made radioactive, photons
of specific energies are released. 
Since the photons that an ele­
ment is likely to emit are already 
known, neutron activation can be 
used to determine the composi­
tion of an unknown material.
So how does it work? To make 
a material radioactive, a source 
of neutrons is needed. Since neu­
trons have no electric charge, 
they are hard to obtain, but physi­
cists have developed an ingenious 
way around this problem. When 
plutonium decays into uranium, 
it releases a type of radioactiv­
ity called an alpha particle. If 
this alpha particle is absorbed by 
the element beryllium, the two 
combine to make an isotope of 
carbon. And as this unstable car­
bon isotope decays, it releases a 
high-energy neutron. We have 
our neutron source!
Unfortunately, high-energy 
neutrons are fairly useless, since 
they are moving too fast for a tar­
get material to absorb them. To 
slow them down, the neutrons are 
passed through graphite, water, 
or wax, all of which have lots of 
protons. The neutrons bounce 
around among the protons, even­
tually slowing down enough to be 
absorbed.
When a target nucleus ab­
sorbs these “thermal” neutrons, 
the target becomes radioactive 
and decays, emitting photons of 
various energies in the process. 
Scientists have become very good 
at gauging the energy of photons 
and, using the measured “spec­
trum” that the radioactive'target 
emits, they can predict the com­
position of the target material.
So what is neutron activa­
tion used for? NASA is going to 
use it to look for water on Mars. 
The new rover planned for 2009 
will carry a neutron activation 
apparatus built by the Russian 
Federal Space Agency to look 
for hydrogen. The device will be 
used to detect water, which will 
be indicated by high hydrogen 
readings.
In 1979, Luis Alvarez and his 
son Walter Alvarez; used neutron 
activation to claim that a 10- 
km asteroid had collided with 
Earth 65 million years ago. The 
element iridium is very rare on 
Earth, but the Alvarezes had de­
tected unusually large quantities
A NASA rover, scheduled to go to Mars in 2009, will be equipped with a neutron activation apparatus to detect 
hydrogen-rich water molecules.
of the metal in the Cretaceous- 
Tertiary boundary of the Earth’s 
crust. When Alvarez realized that 
the high concentration could be
due to a huge dust cloud from 
an asteroid impact, he predicted 
that iridium would be found in 
similar concentrations across the
globe. Experiments at over 100 
sites across the globe confirmed 
this, and the cause of dinosaur 
extinction was found!

Matsuoka lab designs hand devices to aid in rehabilitationPitt offers 
new thoughts 
on evolution
EVOLUTION, from A8
and to the theory proposed by 
Schwartz. If a mutation occurs in 
a dominant gene, the organism 
will die. If it occurs in a recessive 
gener then it lies inactive. As this 
recessive gene is carried, it will 
slowly be passed along from gen­
eration to generation. Eventually 
the population becomes saturated 
with the recessive gene, and by 
chance an offspring can have two 
copies and a novelty will occur.
Since it is almost impossible to 
predict when the mutation will 
manifest, the time and place of 
occurrence of the mutated gene 
is like shuffling a deck of cards. 
“If a novel feature doesn’t kill you, 
you know you have it,” Schwartz 
said. For example, if two copies 
of a recessive gene for lungs oc­
cur in an organism in the ocean, it 
will drown. Instead of organisms 
“adapting” to their environment, 
organisms are distributed through 
nature through the elimination of 
the “wrong” traits. No persistent 
mechanism actually promotes 
evolution as Darwin believed. It is 
the lack of an organism’s ability to 
maintain balance in the stresses of 
an environment that permits nov­
elty to occur.
Schwartz has also published 
The Human Fossil Record, which 
is the first study of the history of 
human fossils, and The Red Ape, 
which outlines morphology and 
molecular approaches to phylo- 
genic reconstruction.
Maresca, in conjunction with 
Laszlo Vigh, has worked out the 
role of membrane lipids and 
physical state in regulating gene 
expression.
Schwartz showed that his new 
theory of evolution has profound 
effects today as the environment 
continues to become diminished. 
As the degradation of the envi­
ronment continues, the window 
of opportunity for organisms to 
survive and evolve will decrease. 
We have an urgency and responsi­
bility to take care of what’s left of 
our world.

Anatomically-Correct Testbed Hand (ACTH). It can be used as a telemanipulator that mimics both the active and 
passive dynamics of a human hand, and as a working physical model for neuro- and plastic-surgeons.
intended for simple tasks such 
as pinching, pointing, and grasp­
ing. The device is controlled by 
the user’s own muscle signals by 
using surface electromyography 
sensors attached to the arm. This 
hand could also be attached and 
removed as required.
In order to better understand 
the control and coordination of 
the brain over the hand, the Neu- 
robotics lab has devised another 
project to study neuromuscular 
hand control. The project has 
two goals: to understand how 
the brain solves the problem of 
human hand control and to de­
sign prosthetics that can be con­
trolled by the brain.
To achieve the above goals, 
the Matsuoka lab is currently 
putting visual markers on 
human fingers and using the 
data to understand how the 
body controls the hand, in order 
to devise a more realistic model 
of the hand. An electrical brain 
interface is also used to detect 
electrical signals from the brain. 
However, the material used in 
the interface is incompatible 
with the neurons. Due to this, 
the device fails to detect signals 
from the neurons after a while. 
Researchers are currently work­
ing on developing biologically-
cine and engineering? Afshar’s 
message might just make you 
consider it: “I believe that the 
most interesting and challeng­
ing problems today are at the 
interface between medical sci­
ence and engineering. To solve 
these problems requires both 
a thorough understanding of 
patients and medicine and the 
technical ability to identify and 
solve the underlying scientific 
questions. This is exactly the aim 
of the MSTP [Medical Scientist 
Training Program, a program at 
UPMC]: to train students with 
passion to help humanity and 
skills to create new science.”
So now that you have a good 
sense of the kind of .research 
being conducted in this lab, 
Pedram Afshar is giving you 
a chance to participate in his 
research!
“The goal of my project is to 
determine how neural activity 
going to finger muscles creates 
finger movement. I recruit par­
ticipants who are right-handed 
with no history of neurologic 
disease. The participants will

sure the neural activity to their 
muscles and their index finger.

neurons in order to combat 
this problem.
Based on current research, 
the future could see a pros­
thetic hand controlled entirely 
by the brain. In the words of 
Weghe: “This device will be 
able to transmit past dam­
age. It could perhaps be able 
to bypass numb parts of an 
injured arm, for example. 
The brain will eventually learn 
which nerves to use.”
The scope of these proj­
ects is immense. “There are 
rehabilitative institutes that 
may benefit from our pub­
lished research, as well as small 
companies or other institutes 
that could pick it up,” said We­
ghe. “This research will help 
to understand body function, 
what kind of things we can do. It 
will lay the groundwork for the 
application and development of 
many techniques and devices.”

It is midnight. You just fin­
ished writing a lab report, but 
your happiness is short-lived 
as you remember that you also 
have a paper due tomorrow. In 
times like these, you wish you 
had another hand that could do 
work for you. Well, this dream is 
not as bizarre as it seems.
The Neurobotics lab is cur­
rently involved in three projects 
that focus on the hand. These 
projects will benefit those whose 
ability to use the hand is lost due 
to physical injury or illness. One 
of these projects is called the An­
atomically Correct Testbed Hand 
(ACTH). Begun in 2002, the proj­
ect’s goal is to devise a hand that 
could serve as a model to better 
understand the coordination of 
the hand via brain signaling. The 
ACTH could also serve to detect 
Hutchinson’s disease, the first 
symptom of which is the impair­
ment of motor abilities.
The ACTH could one day serve 
as a device that emulates the 
hand movements and functions 
for prosthetics and remote op­
erations. But more importantly, 
it will serve as a physical model 
for surgeons to test surgical 
reconstruction techniques for 
impaired hands. Where this hand 
differs from most robotic hands 
is that it also emulates the bio­
mechanical aspects of the body
that are pivotal for the proper 
functioning of the hand via the 
control signals that act like neu­
ral commands. In other words, 
the hand is made to mimic a real 
human hand as much as pos­
sible. “There would be a lot less 
to do with the software design 
and mechanical settings if the 
dynamics of the hand were right. 
Movement of the hand would 
come naturally,” said Weghe, 
who is working as a research pro­
grammer for this project.
The biggest challenge the 
Matsuoka lab faces in develop­
ing the ACTH is finding the right 
materials to use. It is crucial to 
know which parts are vital for 
the hand to function and which 
serve no significant purpose. In 
addition to engineering the ten­
dons to match the tendons that 
are present in the actual hand, 
they have also been successful in 
devising an actuator that mimics 
the active and passive mechanics 
of the human muscles. It could 
be used in the ACTH as long as 
it does not interfere with the size 
and weight of the hand by alter­
ing the tendon structure of the 
hand. In order to simulate the 
active and passive muscle activ­
ity and contractions, a custom- 
made spring and a motor were 
installed.
The second project in the Neu­
robotics lab is a hand exoskeleton. 
The primary difference between 
the two projects is that the exo­
skeleton would be more like a 
glove and could be used for peo­
ple whose hands have impaired 
functions. The exoskeleton is

Our best scientists should not be censored
NASA’s tight control over its scientists’ statements suggests government influence
“Good science cannot long persist in 
an atmosphere of intimidation.”
These words were written in a letter 
from Representative Sherwood Boehlert 
(R-NY) to NASA administrator Michael 
Griffin, and should serve as a strict warn­
ing. Boehlert, the chairman of the House 
Science Committee, sent the letter to 
the aerospace administration’s head last 
week, criticizing the agency for attempt­
ing to censor its top climatologist, James 
Hansen.
Hansen, who has a long history of 
speaking out about global warming, 
gave a lecture last month about the 
growing importance of reducing green­
house gas emissions. Shortly after the 
lecture, NASA administrators ordered 
all his future lectures and publications 
to be “reviewed” before going public. 
The implication, of course, is that NASA 
doesn’t want him speaking his mind on 
environmental issues again.
It’s no secret that the Bush administra­
tion is knee-deep in contracts with Big 
Energy. Whether it’s conspiring with oil 
or coal companies, the Bush administra­
tion will do anything to make life better 
for some of this country’s (and this plan­
et’s) biggest polluters. This situation is 
worrisome because it presents a chilling
conflict of scientific interest. Where does 
the allegiance of organizations like NASA 
reside — with the legitimate pursuit of 
scientific research and advancement, or 
with a check-signing government that 
might not always want the stone-cold 
truth made public? Adding anti-pollu­
tion measures like smokestack scrubbers 
would cost the industry billions — bil­
lions they won’t have to spend if no one 
calls them out on it.
But how can NASA get away with cen­
soring its own employees? Dean Acosta, 
a highly placed press secretary at NASA, 
denied that anything fishy transpired. 
Instead, he simply claimed that the 
crackdown on Hansen was because he 
bypassed standard agency guidelines for 
making public statements. Acosta said 
that these guidelines require all state­
ments and research papers to be reviewed 
before they are publicly announced.
The Bush administration is making 
NASA nothing but a mouthpiece, putting 
out only the information that furthers its 
particular goals and interests. For a nation 
that was once on the forefront of science, 
engineering, and technology, America 
has recently edged its way towards be­
coming an international laughingstock. 
We refused to sign the Kyoto Protocol, a
massive global accord to reduce indus­
trial emissions and hopefully reduce, 
or at least slow down, the greenhouse 
effect. While Japanese companies like 
Toyota and Honda are churning out im­
mensely popular and environmentally 
friendly hybrid gasoline-electric cars, 
the best selling vehicles put out by the 
big three American manufacturers are 
still gas-guzzling trucks and sport utility 
vehicles. .
Michael Crichton hit the nail on the 
head in his latest novel, State of Fear: “[It 
is] the requirement of every sovereign 
state to exert control over the behavior of 
its citizens, to keep them orderly and rea­
sonably docile. To keep them driving on 
the right side of the road — or the left, 
as the case may be. To keep them paying 
taxes. And of course we know that social 
control is best managed through fear.”
Our government, at this very moment, 
is attempting to silence its dissidents. No 
one is being carted off to waste his days 
in the desolate plains of Siberia, and no 
one is being kidnapped surreptitiously 
in the night; even so, this sort of control 
of who can say what and to whom is yet 
another symptom of the vast information 
control syndicate that is slowly falling 
into place.
Hollywood deserves congratulations
U.S. movie studios took on controversial issues in 2005, brought content back into films
Ah, substance, how we’ve missed you.
For all of the knocks that 2005 re­
ceived about the sad state of film these 
days — and with national theater atten­
dance down seven percent — popping 
$9 on a seat in front of the big screen has 
been a rather depressing prospect. But 
all you need to do is take a look at this 
year’s Oscar nominations to prove there 
was a reason to buy popcorn this sea­
son. And 2005’s offerings have actually 
tackled some incredibly weighty subjects 
that most studios are too often afraid to 
touch.
With the usual drivel has come a lot 
of poignant and unique substance at the 
same time.
Yes, we’ve been given Big Momma’s 
House 2 — which is only weighty from 
the standpoint of Martin Lawrence’s fat 
suit — but this past year has also given 
us films like Syriana, about big oil and 
corruption in the Middle East. Or films 
like Crash, exploring the intricacies of 
racism and human interaction in modern 
Los Angeles. The former is up for Best 
Original Screenplay and Best Supporting 
Actor. The latter was nominated for six 
awards, including Best Motion Picture
of the Year. When was the last year you 
remember the Oscars being this skewed 
toward important subject matter? Along 
with those two are at least five other 
films exploring subjects often deemed 
too controversial (or intellectual) for our 
timid American audiences.
Last year’s winners were nothing to 
sneer at, but their “issues” were wrapped 
up within themselves, and did not ex­
pand into issues facing the world today. 
Million Dollar Baby was a boxing drama. 
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind was 
social commentary, but only on a per­
sonal level. The Aviator was historical, 
yes, but was it as historically important 
as this year’s Good Night, and Good Luck, 
which documents Edward R. Murrow’s 
historic battle to expose the underbelly 
of McCarthyism?
And Spider-Man 2, well...
Years before haven’t been much better, 
either. The problem hasn’t been a lack 
of good films — for instance, you can’t 
argue that the final Lord of the Rings isn’t 
a masterpiece. And to be fair, prior years 
have also given us City of God, House of 
Sand and Fog, and The Pianist, to name 
a few.
What distinguishes this year is that the 
Oscars have been given a greater number 
of poignant scripts. Aside from Syriana, 
Crash, and Good Night, and Good Luck, 
we also have Munich, about the 1972 
Olympic massacre; The Constant Gardner, ¦ 
dealing with the corrupt influences of 
pharmaceutical companies in Africa; 
Brokeback Mountain, with the ever-con- 
troversial social issue of homosexuality; 
and even The New World, finally taking 
a more realistic look at the beginnings 
of our country. Perhaps for every three 
The Islands, 2005 has given us one sub­
stantial gem.
Every year is a crapshoot with the 
American film industry. But something, 
for whatever reason, has driven studios 
to attack some meaningful subjects this 
time around (in addition to their usual 
offering of suspense thrillers and witty- 
yet-pointless comedies). It’d be nice to 
say that U.S. film is becoming more at­
tuned to real life, and therefore more 
relevant. That’s probably too grandiose. 
For now, let’s assume that a few old stu­
dio executives discovered they still had 
pulses — and they read The Washington 
Post a bit more, too.

Recently Google decided to set up 
servers in China, under the condition 
that it will censor its search results as 
per the dictates of the Chinese govern­
ment. It is clear that Google has dis­
regarded civil liberty in the interest of 
the potential revenue it can generate by 
taking advantage of a market of more 
than a billion people.
An alliance between a repressive 
regime and a giant corporation is noth­
ing new. One of the first and most 
distasteful alliances was between T. J. 
Watson of the IBM Corporation and 
Hitler’s Nazi regime. In pursuit of a mar­
ket monopoly, IBM aided the Nazis with 
the then-state-of-the-art punch-card 
technology. The Nazis used it to record 
the number of Jews rounded up, sent to 
various concentration camps, and those 
finally executed.
A considerable number of such eco­
nomic alliances with subversive regimes 
continue today and go largely unno­
ticed.
The revolution of the Internet gave 
hope to the masses around the world 
because our cyber-world was perceived 
to be distributed without any central­
ized control. This, however, did not stop 
the Chinese 
government 
from try­
ing to block 
access in 
China to 
pro-democ- 
racy web­
sites. It took 
advantage 
of the global 
economy 
and invited 
major cor­
porations 
like MSN 
Search and 
Yahoo to set 
up servers in China. But the govern­
ment demanded that those corpora­
tions help it by providing more stringent 
web control, including the tracing of 
users. Such alliances invariably resulted 
in Chinese citizens being jailed because 
they posted something on the Internet 
or wrote something in an e-mail.
Google has had a great PR image with 
its users and the public. Its technology 
has been innovative, and it is perceived 
to be an enabler of greater access to 
information, and therefore freedom of 
speech and expression. It has stunned 
many of Google’s faithful followers to 
see it acquiesce to the Chinese demands 
for censorship.
Several prominent columnists (Bill 
Thompson of BBC News and Sebastian 
Mallaby of The Washington Post in 
particular) have defended Google’s
decision in recent articles, pointing 
out that Google is different because its 
agreement with the Chinese categori­
cally states that with every censored 
search, the results will explicitly men­
tion the fact that the search has indeed 
been censored — i.e., if someone is told 
that he is being brainwashed, then he is 
not brainwashed at all.
Yahoo recently aided the Chinese 
government in tracking down a user 
because he discussed pro-democracy 
topics. Mallaby claims that Google has 
not done something as repulsive. But 
if the Chinese government wants to 
trace a Gmail user, has Google categori­
cally expressed that it will not disclose 
private information? Is this part of the 
Google-China deal? Sadly, we don’t 
know the details of the deal, but if this 
was a factor, then I am sure Google 
would have trumpeted this aspect in 
its defense of censorship. So there is 
no guarantee that Google will not pull 
a Yahoo in aiding the Chinese govern­
ment in tracing users.
The argument that “letting Chinese 
users know when they are being cen­
sored is progressive” is pure rhetoric.
There are millions of Chinese who live
in the United States, Europe, and other 
parts of the world. They are well aware 
of Chinese 
censorship 
and a major­
ity of these
immigrants 
still main­
tain contact 
with rela­
tives and 
friends in 
China. It’s 
ignorant to 
assume that 
Chinese web 
users do not 
know that 
they are 
being cen­
sored (or brainwashed). Whether or not 
Google discloses such information, the 
Chinese already know that information 
is being withheld, and no matter what, 
they still can’t get to it. It’s naive to think 
that Google has put one over on the 
Chinese government.
I am depressed by Google’s collu­
sion with the Chinese government. It 
re-affirms my cynicism that “ethical 
commerce'” is just an oxymoron. Here 
was an opportunity for these corpora­
tions to force a change in China. If they 
had all collectively taken a firmer, more 
principled position, the Chinese govern­
ment may have had to re-think some of 
its censorship laws, lest it be left lagging 
in a fast-paced cyber-world. But money 
has once again triumphed in this di­
lemma, and the corporations are towing 
the autocratic line.
An alliance between a 
repressive regime and a 
giant corporation is nothing 
new. One of the first and 
most distasteful alliances 
was between T. J. Watson 
of the IBM Corporation and 
Hitler’s Nazi regime.

I don’t have a job yet, and I’m okay with it. Why aren’t you?
Jackie Brook
No matter what stage of life 
are in, there seems to be an 
age-appropriate question those 
around you feel compelled to ask. 
When you’re young, it’s “What do 
you want to be when you grow 
up?” In high school, it becomes 
-"What college do you want to go 
to?” As college graduation rolls 
' around, it evolves into “What are 
your plans? Where are you work­
ing?” After that comes “When are 
'you getting married?”, “When 
are you having kids?”, “When are 
you retiring?”, and “When are 
you going to die?”
The problem I have with this 
line of questioning does not lie 
within the questions themselves, 
blit rather the reaction to their 
'Answers. When I was younger, I 
'Went through a number of phases 
frying to figure out my niche in 
life. At three years old, I had 
decided I would be a reverse psy­
chologist when I grew up, an idea 
my mother laughed at. In third 
grade, I was hell-bent on becom­
ing a stand-up comedian,'a phase 
T'toas encouraged to grow out 
ftf. When I entered high school, I 
had decided I wanted to become 
a'profiler for the FBI, yet my high 
school guidance counselor felt 
the need to dash my dreams as 
she told me I “wouldn’t pass the 
background check.” Never were 
my decisions supported.
Lately, questions about my 
plans for the future have flooded 
in. Am I going to continue with 
Sdhool? Do I have a job lined 
up? Is my resume updated? Do I 
know where I will be living? With 
each inquiry into my future, it is
hard not to grow aggravated with 
the seemingly unending barrage 
of probes.
Now that my graduation is less 
than four months away, I have 
been bombarded with questions 
about graduate school or where 
I plan on working. When I reply 
with the simple “That’s a good 
question,” people respond with 
looks of pity and condolence. 
Why, I ask, do people feel the 
need to feel bad for me? I am per­
fectly content with my situation, 
and there is no need for anyone 
to feel bad for me, particularly 
when they do not understand my 
position.
The larger issue at hand is our 
incessant need to ask others the 
questions to which we do not 
have answers ourselves. Ellen 
DeGeneres once joked that the 
reason adults ask kids what they 
want to be when they grow up is 
because the adults are “looking 
for ideas.” Are we asking those 
around us about their career as­
pirations because we cannot find 
direction on our own?
I find that there are only two 
other reasons people grow in­
quisitive about my job pros­
pects. First, they are making 
polite conversation. Typically, 
these inquiries come from dis­
tant family members or people 
I interact with in passing. The 
second group, and perhaps I am 
cynical in thinking this, consists 
of people who are itching to 
share their own good fortune, 
wanting to tell of the wonderful 
job they’ve landed at Deutsche 
Bank or Goldman Sachs.
Congratulations. Your future is 
secured with a 401 (k) and health 
benefits. But will you be any hap­
pier than other people who are 
still searching for the jobs that 
are right for them?
aireducJby
So often people forget that we 
are still in our formative years, 
working hard at finding our­
selves and what we are good at. 
The constant pressure to define 
our worth by knowing our future 
plans is often too much to han­
dle, making the already stressful 
time leading up to graduation 
seem even more arduous than it
is. Why do we find the need to 
justify our life and our work with 
solid plans for our future?
I, for one, will not allow the 
value of my work be determined 
by the plans I cannot make. And, 
more importantly, I will not allow 
those around me to shame me for 
not having answers to questions 
that do not need answering.

Pittsburgh and its Steelers: civic pride or codependency?
Ben Hackett
When the festivities end and the bar­
ricades are taken down in the South Side, 
it might be time to bar up the windows 
and lock the doors. That might seem to be 
an exaggeration, but after some statistical 
merrymaking, this apparent overstate­
ment will morph into sound advice.
Sure, there is a charming characteristic 
to a city with a pervasive civic pride. Yet 
eVfen when the bus exhaust puffs black and 
gold it can serve, at best, as only a smoggy 
cloud covering the lack of a civic essence. 
Pittsburgh, outside its sport franchises, ac­
tually has very little civic pride. If the city 
of Pittsburgh is a damaged piece of fur­
niture, the Pittsburgh Steelers, and their 
beloved Steelers Nation, are the lacquered 
facade covering the blemishes.
Today, as Super Bowl fever grips the re­
gion, a visitor to Pittsburgh could not help 
but be enveloped with Steeler Pride. The 
buses flash “Go Steelers” on their displays. 
Be they mom-and-pop shops or corporate 
bailiwicks, Steelers paraphernalia line the 
windows of every business from the gritty 
downtown to the sprawling suburbs of the 
Steel City.
The black and gold signs display “Go 
Steelers,” “In Ben We Trust,” or “One for 
the Thumb.” However, they should read: 
“Watch your back if the Steelers win.” 
Hell, watch your back if the Steelers lose. 
The case tying a climate of crime to a fa­
natical obsession can be strongly placed 
into the public docket.
Tying the mental health ' of a city to 
the rise and fall of a sports franchise is 
unhealthy even by the most anecdotal of 
measures and evidence. In a recent New
York Times opinion editorial, the author, 
Holly Brubach, attempts to lay out a case in 
favor of the quirks of the city of Pittsburgh. 
Instead, Brubach provides readers with 
statements indicative of this city’s tenuous 
general mental health.
She writes that “Pittsburgh needs the 
Steelers in a way that few, if any, other 
cities need their teams. The Steelers are 
our mirror: they tell us who we are. When 
they win, we walk a little taller.” What 
does that sound like — a devout fan, or a 
codependent depressive who feels incom­
plete without her significant obsession’s 
presence?
The tragedy of the resident-team rela­
tionship continues to unfold in Brubach’s 
piece. Speaking to her earlier years as a 
resident of “Da Burgh,” she speaks of her 
“appreciation for Pittsburgh” as “relatively 
recent.” She continues, saying, “Like a
garnered these residents a “respect,” one 
that never existed for them even when 
they thought about “themselves.” This is 
a troubling thought. Sports can be both 
uplifting and memorable, but they are 
nothing more than entertainment. A mem­
orable sporting event has always been 
more about the people you are watching 
or attending with than the effect it has on 
one’s mental health and well-being. The 
relationship between citizen and franchise 
is more complex when said franchise’s 
success is tied to measureable negative 
effects.
The emphasis of a society, and more 
locally, a city, cannot rely solely on a con­
centration in arts and leisure. In the long 
run, sports are insignificant. When a city’s 
mental health and general pride are so 
closely tied to a particular franchise, that 
city can experience other problems associ-

lot of natives, I grew up feeling apolor 
getic that the city, with its smokestacks, 
factories, and railroad trestles, wasn’t pic­
turesque (this was back in the days before 
‘industrial’ was an aesthetic); that, being 
closer to Ohio than to the Eastern sea­
board, it wasn’t more cosmopolitan; that it 
was a blunt, hard-charging, working-class 
town in an increasingly nuanced, execu­
tive world. When, beginning in 1975, the 
Steelers won four Super Bowls in six years, 
they earned us a respect we’d never had, 
not even for ourselves.”
Concentrate on that closing line. The 
Steelers’ winning of the four Super Bowls
ated with the rise and fall of that franchise. 
What would one say if there were data that 
supported a correlation in an increase or 
decrease in local violent crime with a large 
change in the Pittsburgh Steelers’ win/loss 
record? The following has a controversial 
taint; but remember this quick exercise in 
empirical data analysis has a benevolent 
intent in hand.
Using the last 10 years of available FBI 
criminal statistics data, there are some 
points of interest. There is a correlation 
between the two largest increases in vio­
lent crime in Pittsburgh and the Steelers’ 
win/loss records taking a downturn. In
2002, the number of violent crimes in 
this city jumped from 2964 to 3794, an 
increase of 28 percent. This, the highest 
jump in violent crime in the 10-year study, 
corresponds to a change in the Steelers’ 
win column from 13 to 10 during the same 
time period.
Next, examine the period from 1997 to 
1998. Violent crimes jumped from 2778 
to 3156, an increase of 13.6 percent. This 
was the second-largest jump in violent 
crimes in the 10-year time period studied 
here. It also happens to correspond to a 
Steelers win-column change from 11 in 
1997 to seven in 1998.
The correlation also works in the op­
posite direction. In 2000, the Pittsburgh 
Steelers went 9-7 and missed the playoffs. 
The next year, the Steelers went to 13-3 
and the AFC championship game. This 
positive change in the team’s record corre­
sponds to the largest drop in violent crime 
in the 10-year sample: a drop of 10 percent 
from 2000 to 2001. Even considering last 
year, with the dramatic franchise record 
reversal as an obvious outlier, there is a 
generally significant correlation found in 
the numbers.
Any researcher worth his salt must ad­
mit that correlation does not equal causa­
tion. Yet, these figures offer one something 
evocative to ponder. Are these numbers 
simply causal coincidences? Maybe. Or 
perhaps they are indicative of a more pan­
demic problem. When temporary satisfac­
tion associated with a sport franchise’s 
success is confused with true personal 
happiness, it is time for some introspec­
tion. That said: Go Steelers.
Statistically significant? Maybe. Pertinent? 
Always. As such, Benjamin Hackett

Perspectives 
Senate must 
reach out to 
constituents
Tom Sabram
I spent this past Thursday as 
I spend most of my Thursdays: 
attending the Undergraduate 
Student Senate meeting as an 
ex officio member. As I sat there 
and waited to give my report 
on various updates, I wondered 
how detailed the debate would 
be on the Students’ Rights Policy, 
hoping we would have a substan­
tial amount of time to discuss 
the potential ramifications of the 
resolution in support of the pro­
posed amendments. I was slightly 
unnerved when four funding 
motions passed in a flurry of 
Senate activity — in about 10 
minutes. Finally the discussion 
arrived and I was more than sat­
isfied with its length. However, 
one question I posed left me with 
a disturbing response; I wanted 
to know how many Senators had 
actually talked to their constitu­
ents — or even friends — about 
this potential new policy. Sadly, 
very few had made mention of it 
to anyone.
When dealing with potential 
amendments that can affect the 
entire student population, it is 
important to have input from 
and communication with fellow 
students. Not only have most of 
the Senators forgotten to make 
themselves more visible, but I 
face the same problem, too. This 
is something I am working on 
fixing in the second semester of 
my term.
Last semester, after an edito­
rial was written about the lack of 
transparency of my administra­
tion, I took time to reflect upon 
what I thought I was doing right 
and what I was criticized on. In 
order to protect the integrity of. 
certain tasks, I can’t always dis­
close every project I am working 
on. However, I should be more 
forthcoming on my projects. I 
have been spending more time 
planning and writing my col­
umns this semester. Currently, I 
am looking into the feasibility of 
having some kind of air time on 
WRCT, hopefully with the ability 
to have students ask questions 
directly to me.
This week, I will be scheduling 
my office hours. Now that I am 
a second-semester senior with 
a much more open schedule-, I 
will be able to vary the location 
of the weekly office hours, so 
I can be found in a more open 
area on campus rather than al­
ways on the third floor of the 
University Center, where my 
office is located. Those are the 
major changes in the upcoming 
few weeks. I hope these will al­
low me to communicate with you 
on a much more frequent basis. > 
Since Nicolette and I are the only 
two people in the student body 
(vice) president positions, we 
can miss certain obvious sugges­
tions to improve our office. If you 
have any suggestions, feel free to 
e-mail or talk with me so I can 
make myself more available to 
serve you, the student body.

The women’s basketball team 
lost the first of a four-game home 
stretch against third-ranked 
WaQshington University in St. 
Louis on Friday night 83-58. The 
Tartans got into early foul trouble, 
allowing the Washington Bears to 
race to a double-digit lead. The 
Bears relied on their perimeter 
shooting and uptempo style to 
exploit the Tartans’ zone defense. 
In the second half, the Tartans 
came out gunning with a 7-2 run 
led by first-year Jeanette Schil­
ling. However, CMU’s Rachelle 
Roll suffered a right ankle sprain 
with six minutes left, and the Tar­
tans were unable to finish strong. 
Schilling had a team-high 12 
points and four rebounds while 
Danielle Beehler had a double­
double with 19 points and 12 
rebounds for Washington.
Following the loss to Washing­
ton, the Tartans were unable to 
bounce back and secure a win 
against the University of Chicago 
Maroons Sunday, losing 72-50. 
Trailing most of the game, CMU 
was able to step ahead to 16-15 
with 9:52 left in the first quarter, 
but Chicago responded with a 
24-10 run to close the half. The 
Maroons never trailed after half- 
time as they prevented the Tartan
players from scoring in the dou­
ble digits, forcing a disappointing 
28.8 percent from the field. Fol­
lowing this loss, CMU falls to 0-9 
in the UAA with an overall record 
of 5-15. Dava Sommermeyer was 
the leading scorer for CMU with 
nine points while Susie Gutowski 
had 21 points and eight rebounds 
for Chicago.
The women face New York Uni­
versity on Friday at 6 pm and 
Brandeis on Sunday at 3 pm. Both 
games are at home.
In their first match of the 2006 
portion of their season, men’s 
tennis served up a 5-4 win over 
Division II Mercyhurst College, 
which now has a 4-2 record. Lu­
cas Krasowski, Dan Munoz, and 
Jordan Koslosky all won their 
singles matches in two sets. An­
drew Clearfield came back after 
a rough first set to win his match 
against Lee Michael Marnik. Two 
Tartan doubles teams fell to the 
Lakers, and the last won by de­
fault. Tennis faces Kenyon Col­
lege and Denison University this 
week.
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s indoor track and
field team competed at the un­
scored Denison University Big 
Red Invitational last Saturday.
The men claimed first in seven 
events, and had 16 top-three fin­
ishes at the meet. CMU’s perfor­
mance in the 800-meter dash was 
exemplary — the Tartans chased 
down four of the top five places. 
The team went into the event 
with one meet — a first place 
win — under their belts. With 
a large team and a strong start, 
the season looks promising for 
the men.
Three Tartan women won top 
finishes and the team placed in 
the top three in another three 
events. Jocelyn Sikora finished 
the 1500-meter run nearly two 
seconds before her closest com­
petitor. Jessica Meng dominated 
the triple jump, soaring two feet 
farther than the competition. 
Allison Hannen topped eight feet 
in the pole vault, a full foot higher 
than her only competitor.
The women’s successes should 
be a boost to the team’s morale. 
In their first meet, the women 
took seventh place out of nine. 
The team has hard work ahead 
if they want to see some more 
first place finishes as the season 
moves forward.
On February 10, both track and 
field teams will compete at the 
Oberlin Invitational.

edges the realities of the business. He’ll 
be the first to say that as the coach, he 
had to take the blame for the losses
— but boy, can he celebrate the win. 
Already people are saying that this win 
may cement Cowher’s future spot in the 
NFL Hall of Fame. For his perseverance 
alone, he’s earned it.
Of course, coaching and preparation 
alone cannot win championships; players 
must also step up and make plays when 
it counts, and for many Steelers, this win 
was just as important for their careers as 
it was for Cowher’s. First, there’s Jerome 
Bettis winning the Vince Lombardi tro­
phy in his home town, capping what is 
likely his last year in the league. Then 
you have Willie Parker, an undrafted 
free agent and first-year starter break­
ing a 75-yard run for a touchdown on 
the world’s biggest stage. And let’s not 
forget Hines Ward, the Super Bowl MVP, 
who this time last year was crying at 
the post-AFC Championship press con­
ference, telling the world how upset he 
was that Bettis would never reach the 
Super Bowl.
For me, a Pittsburgh native, the. mag­
nitude of this win hasn’t yet sunk in. 
Pittsburghers and Steelers fans every­
where have come so far and waited so 
long for this moment. The elation of 
winning the big one stands in such stark 
contrast to the three AFC Championship 
losses that I’ve experienced first-hand. 
All I can say is that the Steelers made 
history Sunday night. The last time 
Pittsburgh won the Championship was 
six years before I was born, but in the six 
years prior to that final victory the team 
won an unprecedented four times. I can 
only hope that this is the beginning of a 
new dynasty.
strangers to second-half comebacks. 
The sputtering offense found success 
early in the second half with an out-of- 
character between-the-tackles run, and 
Willie Parker sprinted 75 yards to the 
end zone, setting a Super Bowl record for 
the longest rushing touchdown. Things 
began to look even better with the team 
threatening to score once again, but an 
errant third-down pass by quaterback 
Ben Roethlisberger was intercepted at 
the goal line and set up a drive that even­
tually ended in a Seattle score.

Just when it looked as if things were 
spiraling out of control, Ike Taylor — an 
otherwise extremely talented corner- 
back who has been somewhat maligned 
for dropping interceptions — picked off a 
wayward Matt Hasselbeck throw deep in 
Steelers territory. For what feel like the 
sixth time in the season, Steelers offen­
sive coordinator Ken Wisenhunt came up 
with the perfect trick play at the perfect 
moment: Big Ben Roethlisberger received 
the shotgun snap on third down, handed 
it off to Parker, who reversed to Antwaan 
Randle-El, setting up a game-clinching 
long touchdown pass to a wide-open 
Hines Ward. Ward was later named 
Super Bowl MVP.
The rest, as they say, is history. The 
Steel Curtain tightened up in the final 
minutes, and the Bus was not stopped, 
at least not soon enough to kill the clock 
and secure the Steelers win. As the city 
rejoices, this season — and this game
— will undoubtedly go down as one of 
the most exciting and uplifting wins in 
Steelers history.
Granted, only four members of the 
Steelers staff got their “one for the thumb” 
last evening, but the implications for the 
younger members of the organization are 
huge. Bill Cowher, the longest-tenured 
active coach in the NFL, has managed to 
pull off the best record of any team over 
the 14-year span that he has been with 
Pittsburgh. Despite this achievement, he 
has come under considerable criticism 
over the last several years for not being 
able to “win the big game.” Prior to last 
night, Cowher had lost four out of his five 
AFC Championship appearances, as well 
as his sole Super Bowl appearance in 
1995. Such criticism would upset some 
coaches, but not Cowher, who acknowl­

Another UAA triumph
Men’s basketball grabs two wins, ups record 
to 17-3 overall and 7-2 in the UAA
by Colin Liotta
Staffwriter
For the second time in less 
than a week, the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team defeated 
UAA arch-rival Washington 
University in St. Louis Friday 
night 79-72 to regain the top spot 
in the UAA standings.
The Tartans came out slow to 
start the game, tak­
ing their first lead 
off of junior Br^d 
Matta’s basket, which 
put the Tartans 
up 20-19. But the 
Bears of Washington 
University quickly 
put up a 10-0 ‘ run 
and continued to 
lead going into half- 
time with the score 
36-30.
In the second half, 
the Tartans began 
to fight their way 
back into the game.
Following a poor first 
half in which the team 
only shot 33.3 per­
cent from the field, 
the Tartans came out 
firing in the second half, shooting 
57.1 percent.
The Tartans led 72-68 with 
1:09 left in the game before Wash 
U. guard Scott Stone nailed a 
three-pointer with 47 seconds left 
to make the score 75-72. After 
some clutch free throws by A.J. 
Straub, the Tartans capped off 
the victory with a Nate Maurer 
dunk as time expired.
,,“We never hit the panic button,”
said Matta, who contributed nine 
points and four rebounds. “We 
kept our composure and played 
like champions, and when you do 
that the result will be a win.”
With the victory, Tartans coach 
Tony Wingen surpassed F.M. 
Cratsley (1949-1966) on the all- 
time wins list with 174 wins dur­
ing his 16 years as the Tartans 
men’s basketball coach.
The Tartans looked to continue
their success going into Sunday’s 
match against the University of 
Chicago Maroons. The team was 
looking for revenge after falling 
to the Maroons 77-80 in OT last 
Friday.
Carnegie Mellon came out of 
the gate cold and quickly found 
themselves down 0-13. The 
Tartans continued to struggle 
with their shooting throughout 
the Sirst half and went into the
break trailing Chicago by 10, 
33-43.
In the second half, the Tartans 
slowly began to find the basket 
and finally took their first lead 
of the game on a Straub three- 
pointer with 3:42 left in the game 
to put the Tartans ahead 66-65. 
Carnegie Mellon never looked 
back as they continued to put 
points on the board until the 
final buzzer. Despite going nearly 
37 minutes with­
out leading, the 
Tartans pulled out 
the victory 76-67.
“It was a good 
win for us,” said 
Maurer, a senior, 
who led the Tartans 
with 26 points. “We 
went almost the 
entire game with­
out leading, so the 
fact that we were 
able to pull out this 
victory means a 
lot and shows that 
we’re never out 
of it.”
Senior Marques 
Johnson, who 
scored 14 points, 
said it was a satis­
fying win. “After dropping a game 
in overtime to them last week, 
and then trailing most of today’s 
game, it felt good to pull out a 
victory since every win against a 
UAA opponent is a crucial one.” 
The Tartans head into next 
weekend as the top team in the 
UAA as they play host to NYU

“We went almost the entire 
game without leading, so 
the fact that we were able

We deserve a better film
Why is 9/11 being handled by Oliver Stone?
When Oliver Stone releases his yet-unnamed 
9/11 movie this August, it will be just short of five 
years since we all watched the smoke rise in New 
York, D.C., and Shanksville, Pa. I didn’t know 
anyone in Washington. I didn't know anyone on 
the plane in Shanksville. But I do know that it 
will be too soon, for me, to witness a re-creation 
of 9/11.
It took over 60 years for a movie about Pearl Harbor 
to be made, and when it was made it was one of 
the worst movies of 
all time. Given that, 
maybe the 9/11 movie 
should be made soon.
If the quality of films 
degrades any more,
Martin Lawrence will 
be winning an Oscar in 
the year 2010. Maybe 
sooner is better.
But please, not Oliver 
Stone.
If the quality of films 
degrades any more, 
Martin Lawrence will 
be winning an Oscar in 
the year 2010. Maybe 
sooner is better.
Stone may make me shudder, but other people 
working on the film aren’t exactly the best 
choices either. First, we’ve got Nicolas Cage as 
the star of the film. Cage is a good actor. But he 
was also in National Treasure. Somehow, I think 
you should be banned from serious films about 
America after that. And the screenwriter is 
Andrea Berloff. She might have talent, but Berloff 
is untried. She has written one other film (though 
she has a few in production). Another of the 
films she will get writing credits for is Harry and 
Caresse. According to 
IMDb it’s about “Hany 
and Caresse Crosby, 
Parisian artists who 
drank, drugged, and 
screwed their way 
through the 1920s."
Stone could be the 
least of our problems.
To be honest, Oliver 
Stone has been a part
of some great films. He impressed the world with 
his cynical and direct look at the stock market 
in Wall Street. I loved The Doors, and a majority 
of critics agreed (Ebert notwithstanding). But 
Stone is known for creating some murky facts 
in his historical films. He got praise for JFK, but 
even those who loved it admitted the movie’s 
conspiracy theory had a few screws loose. And 
Alexander, a terrible film, also used a cheap trick 
to make it seem like the Great might have been 
assassinated, even though the historical records 
say otherwise.
Stone has a history for making things too huge, 
too melodramatic. I don’t know if September 11 
can actually be made bigger than it was, but 
Stone's directorial flaws and the great impact of 
that day will not blend well on film.
There’s one comforting bit of news: The story of 
the yet-untitled 9/11 movie does not attempt to 
tackle the immensity of the event. Instead, it is 
going to focus in on the true story of two police 
officers who experienced terrifying moments 
losing air in the towers. In the preview of the film 
on rottentomatoes.com, I read that "a race against 
time ensued to free them before their air ran out."
I didn’t think I'd be so young when slick directors 
were using catchphrases like "a race against 
time” to describe this terrible event. It is probably 
true that there were few moments in which these 
two men could be saved; it is probably true that 
the men and women sent to rescue the officers 
had only a few minutes to do it. It’s reading those 
words in a movie pitch that bothers me.
This is worrisome.
The film comes at 
a time when I am 
ill-prepared to see 
September 11 again, 
and I think others are, too. I think we should save 
the movie for a later day. The first film portrayal 
of September 11, even one that focuses on just 
two men, ought to be handled with grace. Oliver 
Stone has been a part of wonderful pictures, like 
Platoon, but he is known for flash and pomp.
He had a hand in Scarface, after all. I’m worried 
that he'll bring back all the tension, fear, and 
powerfully loud noises of September 11, only 
worse and louder. And more for impact and 
entertainment than anything else.
I’m certainly not ready for anyone, least of all 
Oliver Stone, to make money off of those who 
passed away that day.

CMU was lambasted in The Tartan for being a pain

“Large organizations are notorious for poor com­

The AP Wire reported a story that many will rec­

but woman is having online trysts. Man finds out. 
Man finds a poem “sent to her [the wife] by ‘The

Sometimes, the jokes come to you.
The University Board of Trustees faced some

I’ll care. Way to go, CMU.
“CMU representatives were notified that they had 
won a $26.4 million government contract to design

Oh man... all my childhood dreams come true.

Darfur is dying: save it with a video game
CMU graduate students’ video game reaches finals of mtvU competition
//%, X W ^
Unfortunately, food distribution was unsuccessful 
this round. Next time, try to maintain peace between 
conflicting tribes during food drops in Darfur.
People Saved: 200 Life:
Just a spoonful of interactive pixels helps the need for social 
welfare and reform go down. Such is the philosophy of the 
recent mtvU Darfur Digital Activist Contest. The contest, which 
called for groups of college students to create video games that 
would help increase awareness of travesties in Sudan, is in its 
final stages. One of the four finalists is by a group of five CMU 
(more specifically, Entertainment Technology Center) masters 
students.
The team, consisting of Camilla Kydland, T.J. Jackson, Clay 
Reister V, Albith Delgado, and Sam Spiro, was hurriedly put 
together last December, and now stands a chance of winning 
$50,000 to further develop their game.
The Reebok Human Rights Foundation, the International 
Crisis Group, and mtvU have joined forces to sponsor this 
contest, aimed at the college demographic. "We partnered 
with our audience to help spread awareness because college 
students have always been the engine for social change," said 
Ross Martin, head of programming for mtvU. "mtvU is simply 
amplifying the message of our audience."
Upon being asked why the contest focuses specifically on 
Darfur, Martin said that "millions of people are dead and 
homeless, and the genocide continues." He recognizes that 
"there are lots of problems in the world, and this is one of 
them," but feels that the Darfur situation is both something 
college students are concerned with and something they need 
to know more about.
“I feel video games have an incredible ability to spread 
awareness and make a difference...,” Martin said. "[The finalist 
games] are actually sort of fun to play, and in the midst of 
that fun, you realize that the world you’re playing in is not so 
simple.... Each game becomes something that starts out as fun, 
and turns into a call for action."
Out of more than a dozen initial entries (a lot, considering 
what it takes to make a video game), the prototypes were 
judged by a combination of college students and employees 
of mtvU, International Crisis Foundation, and Reebok Human 
Rights Foundation. The games with the most viral potential 
and the games most effective at getting their message across 
made it into the final round. Martin said that everyone at was 
"really impressed with the submissions." He also said that they 
expected CMU to enter the contest because of the university's 
“incredible game development talent."
The ETC group was put together by the game's producer, 
Camilla Kydland. Kydland traveled to Africa this past summer 
and witnessed first-hand some of the awful things that people 
do to each other. “The most important part [about my trip] is 
that it drives me,” she said, "because I see the people there as 
individuals — I know people there.”
Kydland had been looking to help people in similar situations 
when she arrived at the ETC in the fall. When she heard 
about the mtvU contest in October, it sounded like the perfect 
opportunity. The team formed in December as finals were 
coming to a close, and they were able to make the game 
quickly, Kydland said, because of their experience at the 
ETC: "We had taken Building Virtual Worlds together, so we 
had experience in making video games, working in a team, 
and making a prototype quickly. We were trained to figure 
something out from start to finish in a short amount of time." 
And she meant it— Guidance, a game by T.J. Jackson which 
became the Darfur game, was created in three days.
"The team did some modifications to Guidance to fit closer to 
the theme of the contest,” Jackson explained. “The idea behind 
the proposal is to create a series of mini-games, so Guidance 
would just be one of many."
Kydland believes that, out of the finalists, her group’s game is 
the best choice because “it has a start, a finish, and concrete 
direction." They paid close attention to the theme and how 
the game mechanics worked with it. "The other games didn't 
seem to have a personal effect on me,” Kydland continued. "I 
think games that show just a struggle and don't give a feeling 
of hope won't do as well [at getting the message across]. Our 
game is about empowering the individual. Whether you win or 
lose, you still learn something."
And win or lose, the group from CMU will still have taught us 
something. The contest demonstrates what video games can 
do for society besides shut their children up. A step up from 
Reader Rabbit, video games can be used to educate college 
students about social issues outside of their dorm and motivate 
them to help the situations.
"If we win, we get a grant for $50,000 and would have to 
become a more formal team to develop the game,” said Sam 
Spiro. Although this specific game may not be a best-seller, 
all those involved agree that this is an important step into the 
future of social awareness. The ideal reaction of a gamer, said 
Ross Martin, would be "now that I've played this game, what 
can I do?”
Now that you Ve read this article, what can YOU do? Go to

Mickey Mouse still loves you
Children’s movies appeal to 18+ crowd by reworking mature themes
Here's a story that you all know: A prince’s father is killed. 
The twist: The prince's uncle did it. The prince is scared and 
confused, with good reason. His mother becomes his uncle’s 
partner, for all intents and purposes. The prince wants to 
avenge his father’s death. And then...
Wait. Which story am I telling? Hamlet or The Lion King? 
They both have different endings, but they both have the 
same beginning.
Welcome to Disney. Instead of appealing only to children, 
Disney and other production studios are now focusing on 
creating movies that will entertain both adults and children. 
The question is whether this movement is something new 
at all.
According to Jesse Schell, former creative director of Disney 
Virtual Reality Studio and currently a professor at CMU, 
Disney has always been for all ages. He said, "The point of 
an animated feature is to attract parents and children. If 
parents are interested in the movie, they’ll tell other parents 
about it, who’ll then take their families to see the movie. This 
also brings families together.” Schell said that Walt Disney 
intended for his company to be like this. "Look at old Disney ' 
movies. Unlike movies like [Nickelodeon's] The Rugrat Movie, 
they appeal to’both adults and children. In fact, they were 
created for adults in the first place.”
And how true. Originally, cartoons, including The Bugs 
Bunny Show, were intended for adults. Most of the feature- 
length movies made at the time also explored mature themes 
because Disney hoped both adults and children could 
enjoy them. For instance, the drama in Snow White and 
the Seven Dwarfs was caused when an evil queen wanted 
her stepdaughter’s heart. Fantasia doesn't even seem to be 
made for children; in fact, most children fall asleep while 
watching it.
Despite their mature themes, these movies never seemed all 
that scary to most children, Schell claims. Perhaps it was the
singing and dancing that was also found within the same 
90-minute movie that made the movies less intimidating. 
However, some people at the time had the same worry that 
people do now — namely that these themes were too much 
for children to handle. According to a 1947 article in the 
Journal of Educational Sociology written by Esther Speyer, 
parents were also worried that the children’s movies were too 
scary for children. As she states, "They [the parents] say that 
situations in films are bringing life's realities to young children 
too soon, are opening up doubts about family relationships 
and friendships, are emphasizing brutality, cheating, lying, 
[and] violent death."
"Children's movies were mature back then," said Schell.
"After Walt Disney’s death, Disney [the company] was afraid 
to tackle serious themes. Now Disney is trying to get back to 
tackling more serious themes." Movies such as Robin Hood, 
The Aristocats, and The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh 
came out in the years following Disney’s death; these movies 
were certainly not known for their ability to scare people with 
their dramatic themes. Although these were good children's 
movies, they weren't what adults wanted to see. As a result of 
this, Disney lost a critical market with these movies... anyone 
over the age of 10.
Disney eventually realized that it had to create movies 
that appealed to a wider audience. Movies like The Little 
Mermaid, Aladdin, and Beauty and the Beast came out, all 
of which appealed to both adults and children. Finally, with 
The Lion King, Disney hit the jackpot. It had created a movie 
that seamlessly integrated something adults would watch 
with something children would understand. Yes, parts might 
seem scary to children; yes, it has some jokes children won't 
understand — but isn’t that part of why adults and children 
love it? As Schell said, "Children enjoy jokes that are over 
their head because they [the jokes] are a little beyond them." 
The fact that children can watch this movie with their elder 
siblings makes them feel grown up. Not only that, but it also 
brought together families — instead of parents leaving their 
children in front of televisions while they did household tasks,
they watched the movies with their kids.
These days, Disney seems to be all for creating films that 
integrate adult ideas into movies intended for children. This is 
especially evident in Disney’s appointment of John Lasgeter, 
Pixar’s executive vice-president, as the chief creative officer of 
Disney Animation and the principal creative advisor at Disney 
Imagineering. Lasseter was the man behind Pixar’s Toy Story, 
The Incredibles, and Finding Nemo. Despite the fact that the 
Disney/Pixar combination is certain to make amazing movies, 
Schell still has worries. "The technology used to make these 
movies allows these movies to look more real. However, the 
line found in animation is lost. In a way, these movies lose the 
sense of intimacy found in traditional animated movies.”
Despite this loss of intimacy, young and old viewers seem 
bound to continue attending these movies, as evidenced 
by the decent turnout for the recent Chicken Little. After 
all, it’s all about remembering what it was like to be a child. 
The people who create these movies know that that’s the 
important part of making kids’ movies. As Schell said, “A 
lot of people forget what it was like to be a child. At Disney, 
we tried to actively pursue that. We cherished the magical 
feelings of childhood, and can’t help but focus on creating 
them for others. Thinking you can create those memories for 
other children is probably [the] biggest motivator of them all."
And for us? Why do we watch them? Maybe we watch them 
because we like to think that one day a fairy godmother 
will show up and make everything right. Maybe we watch 
them because it’s nice to imagine that if life gets confusing, 
animals will burst into song and solve our problems. Or maybe 
we watch them because, as another famous movie says, “Life 
moves pretty fast. If you don't stop to look around once in a 
while, you might miss it." Sure, I might be an adult now, but 
sometimes I just want to take time to "remember the magic."

Chamber music provides intimacy and variety
The Trio Johannes and Cuarteto Latinoamericano are strong local performers
The stage at Carnegie Hall was rather empty last Monday 
evening. The usual dozens of chairs, arsenal of percussion 
instruments, and conductor’s podium were not there. Rather, 
there was only a piano, two chairs, and two stands set up in 
the middle of the stage.
At the dimming of the lights, the large audience fell silent. 
Three musicians came out and sat in the pool of light illumi­
nating the center of the stage. With little flourish, they began 
playing Brahms’ trio for violin, horn, and piano.
The Trio Johannes, named after Johannes Brahms, performed 
all of their namesake's trios over two nights at Carnegie Hall 
with guest William Caballero, principal horn of our own Pitts­
burgh Symphony Orchestra. They played with the elegance 
and shy restraint that marks much of Brahms' music. Each 
performer had total control over his instrument; the pianist 
was accurate and articulate in the running octaves that open 
the second movement, and sublime in the solo chords that . 
open the third, allowing the bass sonorities to overlap. Cabal­
lero controlled his instrument well, blending into the accom­
paniment when he had to, and playing very melodically when 
he was in the foreground.
The Trio Johannes’ interpretation of the horn trio was con­
genial. One almost wishes that they had played with more 
sentiment, but that they denied it to us made it all the more 
sweet. In the dramatic C minor trio for the standard violin, 
piano, and cello, the Trio played with fire while keeping the 
ensemble tight.
Part of the appeal of concerts like this is the intimacy. "There’s 
a lot of variety. It’s so much more intimate, too. People like 
the idea of smaller settings," said Luz Manriquez, a pianist in 
CFA. Concerts like the Trio's concert are often held in smaller 
venues like Carnegie Hall, as opposed to the vastly larger 
Heinz Hall.
Trios, quartets (for two violins, viola, and cello), sonatas (solo
instrument typically with piano accompaniment), and lieder 
(singer and piano accompaniment) are a few types of cham­
ber music. Chamber music is fairly economical, relying on 
just a few performers. The quartet is often said to be the most 
difficult type of composition for a composer to write.
“In writing a successful quartet, composers have to tum in­
ward and look for their most personal musical message, with 
little tools to disguise it and make it superficially attractive," 
said Saul- Bitran, a violinist in the Cuarteto Latinoamericano. 
“This has been the case with composers like Beethoven, 
Shostakovich, Villa-Lobos, etc., who wrote magnificent and 
brilliant orchestral pieces, but it is in their quartets where we 
find their deepest and most personal language."
Indeed, Beethoven wrote 24 quartets and numerous trios. 
Shostakovich wrote 15 quartets. His quartets reveal some 
of his greatest feelings of sadness, stemming from Stalin's 
brutality, that the Soviet authorities tried to suppress in his 
symphonies. One might say that if symphonies are public 
speeches, then chamber pieces are the diary entries and let­
ters of composers.
Chamber ensembles are unique in classical music. While 
many musicians have long relationships with orchestras, 
chamber ensembles have a “very intense relationship," in the 
words of Manriquez.
Bitran elaborated on this point. “The sheer intensity with 
which a professional string quartet develops its career is a 
tough survival test for four individuals who have to spend a 
great deal of time together. In the process of a rehearsal, one 
is scrutinized by the same four people with whom you will be 
spending the rest of the afternoon," he said.
The Cuarteto Latinoamericano will mark its 25th anniversary 
in 2007. Many other quartets — such as the Amadeus, Emer­
son, Juilliard, and Kronos quartets — have stayed together for 
over 25 years. The Beaux Arts Trio has been around for over
50 years, although two of the original members have changed.
Many of the superstar soloists of the century have played 
chamber music in addition to concertos and solo literature. 
Andres Cardennes, a member of the CFA faculty, is the 
concertmaster of the Pittsburgh Symphony. However, he also 
plays a lot of chamber music and is a member of a piano trio.
Chamber music has an interesting culture. There is a great 
tradition of festivals in America as well as in Europe and 
elsewhere. In the United States, the most venerable festival is 
perhaps the Marlboro Festival in Vermont, created in 1951 by 
several great chamber musicians, including Adolf Busch and 
Rudolf Serkin.
Chamber music is popular among conservatory students. Ac­
cording to Manriquez, "they love it. The only thing is that it’s 
time consuming, but people love it. They develop the skill of 
listening to others."
Bitran feels that conservatories concentrate too much on pre­
paring students for solo careers. He said, "I would like to see 
changes in curriculae that would encourage students to take 
up chamber music as a very serious matter. CMU's school of 
music has a strong chamber program."
Chamber music distills music to its simplest — and in many 
ways most potent — elements. It is also a very personal musi­
cal expression. There are many opportunities in Pittsburgh to 
hear great chamber music played by excellent groups like the 
Trio Johannes in small, intimate venues. The Trio Johannes 
concert was part of the Pittsburgh Chamber Music Society’s 
series of concerts, which are held in Carnegie Hall about once 
a month.

Just forget it
Themes in Eternal Sunshine are manifesting themselves in science
Is there someone you wished you had never met? Somewhere 
you wish you had never gone? Something you wish you had 
never seen? Even if you cared enough, how would you go 
about changing these things? You could go back in time. No, 
wait, that's not possible. You could go to therapy. But that 
doesn't always work. You could erase the memory, like they do 
in the movies. I bet you thought that that's not possible either. 
Well, think again.
Neuroscientists actually know how to delete recent memories 
without changing deep-rooted memories. In fact, recent . 
research developments have shown that even deep-rooted 
memories could be erased.
But how exactly does all of this work?
It’s not like the treatment Clementine goes through in 
Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind. And it’s not like the 
"neuralizer" that Agent Kay uses in Men in Black. Actually, it’s 
a lot simpler — it’s just a pill. "It’s the morning-after pill for just 
about anything that produces regret, remorse, pain, or guilt,” 
said Dr. Leon Kass, who chaired the President’s Council in an 
interview with the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics, for 
the Village Voice in 2003.
Memories form when synapses (connections between nerve 
cells) become stronger. This strength varies depending on 
the duration of the memory, which is evident from the fact 
that there are several different types of memories: short­
term memories last a few hours, while long-term memories 
are permanent. Memories increase in strength based on the 
number of "firings’’ the synapses receive. "Firings" allow a 
flow of ions to drain some of the voltage from the neuron.
When the voltage is sufficiently low, it sends an impulse to its 
axon, in turn sending a signal to the next neuron, creating a 
bond. These "firings" may be triggered by adrenaline, which
releases neurotransmitters and hormones and consolidates 
memories. This is the way that memory-enhancing drugs, 
such as Ritalin, and the short-term effects from caffeine and 
nicotine work.
Scientists are creating a drug that could block this 
transmission and weaken the network, thus ensuring that 
the memory won’t “stick." The human brain is extremely 
complex, so it’s not easy to isolate one specific memory 
and “zap" it, so to speak. Deep-rooted memories, especially, 
may be interconnected, making it impossible to erase one 
without changing another. As Dr. William B. Hurlbut, a 
consulting professor in biology at Stanford University, said in 
an interview with the Center for Cognitive Liberty & Ethics, 
"The pattern of our personality is like a Persian rug. It is built 
one knot at a time, each woven into the others. There’s a 
continuity to self, a sense that who we are is based upon 
solid, reliable experience. We build our whole interpretation 
and understanding of the world based upon that experience 
or on the accuracy of our memories: If you disrupt those 
memories, remove continuity, what you have is an erosion of 
personhood.”
These drugs are not meant to help you get over your ex­
boyfriend, but they will help you get over your fear of dogs, or 
erase a traumatic experience like rape. According to ScientiSc 
American Mind, studies have shown that 49 percent of rape 
victims, as well as 17 percent of people who survive serious 
car accidents and 14 percent of people who lose a family 
member, suffer from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 
These events all produce an extremely high level of emotion, 
and therefore an extremely strong memory. If these people 
were treated immediately after the experience, or after an 
"attack,” doctors could interfere with the synthesis of new 
proteins (which make the neural connections stronger), thus 
preventing the formation of a long-term memory.
Memory erasing is certainly not impossible, but it’s not 
exactly a reality either. Even if the drugs were perfected, 
there would by many legal issues — as there were in Eternal 
Sunshine of the Spotless Mind — if it were to go public. There 
is no doubt that it would be useful for therapeutic treatment, 
but it could easily be abused. Memories define a person; they 
are often the only explanation for human behavior. If someone 
could control our memories we’d lose our freedom, and life 
would turn into a rather scary movie.
Just imagine how vulnerable everyone would be. People 
would be able to get away with any crime, from murder to 
theft to rape, as long as they erased the memories of the 
' victims and witnesses. In Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless 
Mind, Dr. Howard Mierzwiak is able to have an affair with 
his secretary, Mary, by erasing her memory each time they 
get together, ensuring that she will never feel guilty. Think of 
all the emotions that would disappear! You could just take a 
pill and never feel guilty, or sad, or scared, or humiliated... It 
would be extremely tempting to do “socially unacceptable” 
things if you knew society would never remember.
Perhaps Mary said it best when she quoted Alexander Pope 
in his poem Eloisa to Abelard: "How happy is the blameless 
Vestal’s lot! / The world forgetting, by the world forgot / 
Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind! / Each pray’r accepted, 
and each wish resign'd”
Maybe it’s best to leave the idea of memory erasing to the 
movies. There's enough drama and action in the real world, 
anyway.

Citizen Kane
Wednesday, February 8 
10,12:30
Orson Welles directed this 
groundbreaking film, considered 
by many to be one of the greatest 
films ever made, and starred in it 
as newspaperman Charles Foster 
Kane. While it’s got no explosions, 
fart jokes, or steamy situations, 
pretty much everyone needs to see 
this movie at some point in their 
life. It’s just one of those movies. 
The moral of the story Citizen Kane 
is that even ruthless, cold-hearted 
newspaper moguls have feelings. I 
wonder if this means that Richard 
Mellon Scaife has feelings, too...
A History of Violence
Thursday, February 9 
8,10,12
Viggo Mortensen plus Ed Harris 
equals crazy delicious. In David 
Cronenberg’s critically acclaimed 
study of violence, secrets, and 
the way both impact small-town 
life, Mortensen stars as a diner 
owner who kills a few thugs.
He’s surprised when the killings 
beget the arrival of Ed Harris, who 
seems to know quite a bit about 
Mortensen’s life. As the story spirals 
out of control, and Mortensen and 
Harris are drawn deep into the 
same web, you'll quickly realize 
that less-than-mainstream movies 
can still be chock-full of the same 
excitement you expect from Jerry 
Bruckheimer’s latest popcorn 
shoveler.
Domino
Friday, February 10 
7:30, 10,12:30
Oh, Kiera Knightley. First you played 
soccer, then you fell in love with a 
pretty-boy pirate, then you rode 
around on a horse for a while... 
and now you're hunting society’s 
filth for cash? The ever-glamorous 
Knightley stars as Domino Harvey, 
the daughter of a famous film actor 
who decides that being a badass 
and shooting large automatic 
weapons is more fun than being 
rich and spoiled. Tony Scott — you 
know, the guy who directed Top 
Gun — was behind the helm for 
this “inspired by a true story” romp. 
That means that underneath the 
glitz and crazy colors, there might 
be a grain of truth. Emphasis on 
might.
The Legend of Zorro
Saturday, February 11 
7:30, 10,12:30
Any man who can cut the dress off 
of a gorgeous woman with a rapier 
is truly a god among men. Antonio 
Banderas, who may as well have 
been born for the role of Zorro — 
the 19th-century Spanish nobleman 
fighting for the peasants of Mexico
— reprises his black-masked role in 
The Legend of Zorro. This time, he’s 
married to Catherine Zeta-Jones 
and has a kid. Alas, the people 
need Zorro, and so he must spring 
back into action. He probably has 
to fight some power-grubbing rich 
guy who has harnessed the power 
of gunpowder for evil. If you’re 
lucky, that villainous wretch will twirl 
his moustache menacingly once 
every 15 minutes.
Memory of a Killer
Sunday, February 12 
7:30,10, 12:30
College is the best place to see 
seriously wacked-out foreign films. 
Originally, AB Films planned to 
show Night Watch, a Russian film 
that starts a trilogy of good-vs.- 
evil supernatural epics. Instead, 
however, they’ve chosen a 
Belgian film about a hit man with 
Alzheimer’s and the two detectives 
who are tracking him. This is 
probably the greatest (and maybe 
only) movie about a hit man with 
a degenerative brain condition
— and that makes it that much 
more important to see. You won’t 
find any scraggly Russians fighting 
vampires, but you will see some 
damn good filmmaking.

Practice makes perfect: practice napping
Doctors and educators recommend napping over working
Last week, I introduced the concept of polyphasic 
sleep— that is, the cycle of sleeping for 20 to 30 minutes 
approximately every four hours — in the context of fitting 
rest into the average over-scheduled day of a typical Carnegie 
Mellon student. Detailing the efforts of a student in CMU’s 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE) fraternity, I began to delve into the 
benefits of napping. So how is brother Helder Rocha holding 
up?
Continuing to deter lethargy and to retain a feeling of 
alertness and ability to perform academically, the SAE brother 
is going strong. So then, can we conclude that three to four 
hours of sleep is enough?
According to the National Sleep Foundation’s research report 
on "Adolescent Sleep Needs and Patterns," the average young 
adult should get between 8.5 and 9.25 hours of sleep a night. 
However, the Washington, D.C.-based foundation discovered 
that the average total sleep time of 19-year-olds during the 
normal school week is only 7 hours 4 minutes. Perhaps I am 
biased, but this statistic cannot possibly hold true for CMU 
students.
"We see lots of students who are having problems sleeping,” 
said Kristine Cecchetti, the health educator in Carnegie 
Mellon's Department of Health Services. She said that many 
students on our campus do not sleep enough, often staying 
awake for 24 to 36 hours at a time. When this happens, such 
negative side effects as mood swings, possible depression, 
stress, weight gain, and insomnia may occur. In fact, when 
students go for such long periods of time on such irregular 
sleep schedules, it becomes seemingly impQssible to
immediately begin sleeping for seven to eight hours a night, 
as one should in theory.
But what about consecutive naps? Cecchetti said that 
it “could be hard to return to normal patterns after [even 
voluntarily] turning to polyphasic sleep." John Thase, of the 
UPMC Clinical Neurological Sleep Center agrees that such 
a choppy sleep pattern associated with the Uberman, or 
polyphasic, sleep schedule may not be healthy.
Normal sleep occurs in a series of phases. Apparently, the 
body must travel from phases one through four, then REM 
(Rapid Eye Movement), then two through four followed by 
REM, then this latter cycle repeated until awaking. However, 
the polyphasic sleep schedule theoretically allows one to leap 
¦from the first cycle to REM, which, although leading such 
participants as Rocha to feel awake and vigilant, may lack 
true health benefits. "If you don't get through the cycle, you're 
going to feel like you didn’t sleep at all,” according to UPMC. 
The negative benefits, such as the heightened tendency to 
make bad decisions, “will snowball," said Tha'se.
It has been proven, however, that napping in itself provides 
many health benefits, such as post-nap alertness and greater 
ability to concentrate. The Tartan wants to help you nap more 
efficiently. Regardless of whether or not the uberman sleep 
schedule fits into your average Carnegie Mellon day, napping 
is definitely a must. Here are five quick tips on napping 
successfully - tips on the art of sleeping.
The first tip: Nap. Just do it. You know you’re tired; this is 
Carnegie Mellon. Just look at your glorious bed. See the silky
(read: jersey cotton) sheets, the tousled caseless pillow... You 
crave it: Don't lie.
Tip two: Nap consistently. Pick a time each day when 
napping fits into your schedule, even if it may mean pushing 
that "unnecessary" resume aside.
A third tip: Set an alarm so that you won't miss your 
Shakespeare class. Or your engineering lecture. Or to make 
sure you can check your e-mail for the 10th time daily - but 
who’s counting?
Fourth: Get comfortable. At times, napping may have to 
occur in an unconventional location. Put your comfort aside, 
and snuggle up to that keyboard in the cluster.
The fifth and final tip: Know that post-nap you will feel 
refreshed and rejuvenated. If rest calls, answer. No work is 
important enough to sacrifice your sleep and subsequently 
your health, which may begin to deteriorate with a lack of 
proper relaxation.
So will polyphasic sleeping be successful in the end? Perhaps 
Rocha and his SAE brothers will keep us updated. Until then, 
remember: Napping is golden.

THE LIFE AND DEATH OF
DIXMONT
STATE HOSPITAL
1859 — 2006
Text and images by
J Robert Kaminski | Photo Editor Greg Prichard | Contributing Editor Marshall Roy | Forum Editor 1
The proper custody and treatment of the insane are now recognized as among the duties which every State 
owes its citizens; and as a consequence, structures for the special accommodation of those laboring under 
mental disease, provided at the general expense, ample in number, and under the supervision of the public 
authorities, will probably, before any long period, be found in every one of the United States.
On the Construction, Organization and General Arrangements of Hospitals for the Insane, 1854
Western Pennsylvania Asylum for the Insane at Dixmont, circa 1860.
In the rolling hills of Kilbuck Township, 20 miles west of downtown 
Pittsburgh, stands a monolithic brick structure overlooking the Ohio River, 
with a sweeping view of the nearby industry and the downtown Pittsburgh 
skyline. It has been situated high above bustling Route 65 and surrounded 
by over 400 acres of forest for nearly 150 years.
Western Pennsylvania Asylum for the Insane at Dixmont was founded and 
dedicated in 1859 by Dorothea Dix, a tireless advocate for the rights of the 
mentally ill. She hand-picked the 407-acre location and adopted a deliberate 
architecture and building layout popularized by Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride 
known as The Kirkbride Plan. Kirkbride, president of the organization that 
later became the American Psychiatric Association, wrote a treatise on 
the design and construction of mental hospitals and the proper care of its 
patients in 1854. Dozens of similar buildings across the country share the 
Kirkbride signature "bat wing" layout and fortress-like presence. So-called 
Kirkbride buildings were, and still are, extremely impressive to the outside 
viewer. The Kirkbride in Weston, W.Va., for example, is thought to the be 
largest hand-cut stone building of any kind on the continent. Although 
some Kirkbrides are still in limited use, many of the hospitals are either 
demolished or abandoned.
Dr. Thomas Story Kirkbride 
1809-1883
Opened in 1862, the Dixmont Hospital was at one point home to over 1200 
patients and an entire staff of doctors, nurses, barbers, dentists, and even 
bakers and butchers. As time wore on, however, the hospital was absorbed 
by the state of Pennsylvania and renamed Dixmont State Hospital. Funding 
became scarce and the institution found it harder and harder to properly care 
for its patients. In the years to follow, changing opinions on the care of the 
mentally ill and the illegalization of formerly accepted medical procedures, such 
as lobotomies and electroshock therapy, wrought the decline of Dixmont.
The Dixmont State Hospital officially closed its doors in 1984 and remained 
abandoned until its demolition last month. Although officially off-limits, curious 
explorers considered Dixmont a prime target. Its age, state of disrepair, and 
former life as an insane asylum were the perfect mix of intrigue and adventure. 
Most appealing was Reed Hall, the largest and oldest building, as well as the 
dining complex behind it. Reed Hall was a target for vandalism and thrill- 
seekers. Several Dixmont buildings have caught fire over the years, most 
recently a portion of Reed Hall in November 2005.
Other attractions for visitors included the morgue, ward rooms (many still with 
original beds and mattresses), and the high-ceilinged dining hall.

DIXMONT AND THE
excerpts from On the Construction, Organization and General Arrang,
"A hospital should be constructed of stone or brick, as may be found most convenient and economical... The building should be in a healthful, pleasant, and fertile district of

Above: The impressive dining hall had columns, a high ceiling, and arches. 
Although it was crumbling into nothing by the time it was demolished, it was 
easy to see the complex architectural thinking put into the hall's design.
Left Column:
Top: Various pieces of everyday life were still present in Dixmont's ruins, 
such as this couch in the cafeteria building. Considering that it was exposed 
to 20 years of outdoor weather and bound to the confines of a crumbling 
building, it was in rather remarkable condition.
Middle: Things were left eerily untouched once the building was closed. 
This activity schedule bulletin board lay on the floor outside of a room, its 
contents worn away with time.
Bottom Left: The demolition of Dixmont was done over a relatively long 
period of time. The face of this section of Reed Hall had been removed 
— exposing three pastel-painted floors — long before the rest came down.
Bottom Right: The original main entrance to Dixmont is now blockaded, 
warning trespassers of the danger of entering the building.

The 407-acre Dixmont plot was purchased in 1999 for $757,000 by a private individual — 75 of 
those acres were recently resold for an undisclosed amount to the Wal-Mart corporation for the 
construction of a Supercenter slated for opening later this year.
A local 400-member organization called Communities First! opposed the new Wal-Mart's 
construction for some time due to traffic concerns, until their effort was squashed in August 2005 
by the secretary of PennDOT. The main Dixmont buildings have been demolished. Reed Hall is 
now completely gone; the word "Supercenter" will soon grace its tombstone.

Following the example of Washington, Pa. (which officially changed its 
town name to “Steelers”), Carnegie Mellon is considering injecting a little 
Steeler pride into campus. So have fun this week leaving Roethlisberger 
Gardens, crossing The Cowher, grabbing a bite to eat at Si Señor Ward, 
and going to class in the Tepper School of Bettis.
As punishment for your defiance, Zeus will chain you to a mountain for 
all eternity. An eagle will visit you every day to feed on your liver. But 
how could you have known that men would build rockets and bombs 
with your gift? You thought we just wanted to have a little light-hearted 
fart-lighting fun. Sony about that.
No, as a matter of fact you cannot capitalize on the bottled water craze 
by marketing bottled air. Yet.
Post-Super Bowl riots will ravage Pittsburgh, destroying all modern 
technology and reinstating the primal, feudal society of medieval times. 
You are powerless to stop it. My advice? Invest in typewriter ribbon, iron 
tools, and medicinal leeches. Your grandchildren will thank you.
The thing about vocations is that you never know when yours will come 
or what it will reveal to be your calling. Everyone thinks that his or her 
purpose in this life will be something special, meaningful, and grand. 
This week, the universe will reveal your life’s purpose to you: urinal, 
partitions - not just for the bashful elite. For all! (It takes all kinds, 
brother.)
You will be asked to stop calling America’s Most Wanted. John Walsh 
has bigger fish to fry than the Hamburglar.
Yes, the not-so-fresh feeling can apply to men, too, but only under very 
specific circumstances. And you definitely can’t go on a picnic with your 
mom to ask her about it.
Bad luck for your sense of smell this week. You know that really funky kid 
in your programming class? Well, Student Senate recently considered a 
mandatory bathing policy, but unfortunately the measure was defeated 
with a two-thirds abstention. Breathe through your mouth?
They say God never closes a door without opening a window. In your 
case, though, this week God will shut all doors and windows, lock the 
fridge, break your TV, and clog ¿he toilet. Remember, though: It’s all for 
a reason (ostensibly).
Your biology class will acquire a small family of baby seals for use in a 
study of Antarctic mammals. To be on the safe side, Student Senate will 
debate a resolution to prohibit the clubbing of baby seals on campus. 
Unfortunately, two-thirds will abstain. Coming next week to Schatz: seal 
meat sloppy joes!
This week you will solve humankind’s greatest modern mystery when 
you discover the identity of the man killed by Freddie Mercury in the 
opening verse of “Bohemian Rhapsody.” But then again, nothing really 
matters.
Remember: Two wrongs don’t make a right (unless two thirds of 
Student Senate abstains from the vote on what is, in fact, the sum of 
two wrongs and said sum becomes “a right” by default).
