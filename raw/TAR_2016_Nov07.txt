CMU students’ design used to develop Aqua Pavilion
RAHEELA AHSAN
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
School of Architecture has 
been granted the privilege to 
contribute to a community gar-
den here in Pittsburgh. Locat-
ed in Uptown, the Aqua Pavil-
ion will function as a structural 
water-catching device, while 
also standing as the attractive 
centerpiece for the local gar-
den. Professor of architecture 
Joshua Bard, along with senior 
architecture major Jack Fogel, 
and junior architecture major 
Brandon Darreff, were con-
tacted for their insight into this 
unique opportunity.
The Aqua Pavilion project 
has been a design assignment 
for second year architecture 
students for the past few years. 
However, it was not until the 
Class of 2019 was contacted 
by Grow Pittsburgh that their 
designs came into fruition. 
Professor Bard elaborated on 
the process of being selected 
to work with the volunteer 
organization. As part of their 
coursework, students had one 
week to design an outdoor 
functional pavilion in teams of 
four back in 2015. That year, 
the instructors had reached 
out to partnering communi-
ties in Pittsburgh to ?nd some 
traction for the application of 
these designs. Grow Pittsburgh 
then reached out to the School 
of Architecture in May of this 
year and offered funding 
should they choose to partici-
pate in the project. In Septem-
ber, nearly 15 students from 
the Class of 2019 volunteered 
to design and construct the 
pavilion before Christmas.
The design was a 
collaborative effort between 
the students and Grow Pitts-
burgh. Several iterations were 
presented, including ideas 
from last fall, until the ?nal 
design was decided on this 
year. The Aqua Pavilion will 
catch and store water in a 
large cistern and will water 
the plants in the Martin Lu-
ther King Jr. Community Gar-
den in the Hill District. The 
overall design is “compelling” 
and “relatively simple to con-
struct,” explains Fogel. Given 
that students are building it, 
the project should not be over-
ly complicated. Fogel describes 
that the completed pavilion 
will be a rectilinear structure 
with beams and columns, 
while having a series of trusses 
that hold up the roof. For aes-
thetic appeal, the trusses will 
each progressively rotate at 
15 degrees to create a “ruled 
surface.”
The onsite structure will be 
easy for the contractor to build. 
Jennifer Lucchino, an adjunct 
professor and co-founder of 
inter*ARCHITECTURE, a lo-
cal contracting ?rm, is part-
nering with the students. 
Students will construct the 
various pieces on campus, 
and then transport the trusses 
to the garden. The materials 
and supplies are all paid for 
by Grow Pittsburgh. The ar-
chitecture students who are 
participating in this project, 
Darreff points out, are purely 
volunteering this semester 
in addition to their existing 
coursework.
Given that the Aqua 
Pavilion will be both a func-
tional and enjoyable aspect of 
the garden, students hope their 
work will integrate into Pitts-
burgh’s community expansion. 
Grow Pittsburgh intended for 
the pavilion to operate also as 
an event space, in faith that the 
community garden will serve 
more as a gathering space. 
Unfortunately, the university’s 
exposure to the project has not 
been extensive. The entire un-
dertaking has been kept within 
the School of Architecture with 
little chatter amongst other 
Carnegie Mellon students. 
However, Bard hopes that the 
completed pavilion will be 
published as a positive impact 
on behalf of the university for 
the community.
Seeing their designs come 
to life and having the oppor-
tunity to contribute to real 
work in the community is an 
incredible opportunity for the 
students. Both Fogel and Dar-
reff are exceptionally proud to 
participate in such an integral 
aspect of Pittsburgh, and see 
their studio work being ap-
plied outside of the classroom. 
For Bard, this opportunity has 
been a work in progress. The 
instructors have been attempt-
ing for a couple of years to ?nd 
partnerships and engage in 
projects like this. The Pavilion 
will be the largest project con-
structed outside of the studios. 
In ten years, both the students 
and professors hope the garden 
grows and adapts the pavilion 
to their needs through commu-
nity engagement from both the 
university and the city.

On Nov. 3, Carnegie 
Mellon president Subra 
Suresh hosted the second 
annual Town Hall at Ran-
gos Ballroom. Over a hun-
dred community members 
attended the event, while 
?ve thousand viewed the 
hour-long meeting online 
through Facebook Live. The 
?rst town hall meeting took 
place on Sept. 30 last year. 
The event aims to begin a 
transparent dialogue be-
tween university adminis-
tration and global Carnegie 
Mellon community. Select 
questions from both the 
attendants and the online 
audience were answered by 
President Suresh after an 
opening speech which sum-
marized the changes that 
have happened since the 
last meeting.
In the opening remark, 
Suresh announced that the 
recent $10 million endow-
ment made by K&L Gates 
Foundation will be used 
toward promoting scholar-
ship throughout the univer-
sity as well as to initiate a bi-
annual conference focusing 
on arti?cial intelligence and 
ethics. In addition, Suresh 
introduced the President’s 
Advising Board, an exter-
nal group of higher educa-
tion professionals convened 
recently to improve the 
wellness of all community 
members.
The brief opening 
speech was followed by 
an open Q&A session 
with the audience. Feli-
cia Evans, a current staff 
member at Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Software Engineer-
ing Institute, initiated the 
dialogue with a question 
concerning the speci?c 
Alumnus Andrew Tesoro shares his experience working for Trump
SHLOK GOYAL
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon Class 
of 1975 School of Architec-
ture graduate Andrew Tesoro 
spoke outside the University 
Center on Nov. 3, encourag-
ing students to vote for Hill-
ary Clinton by explaining his 
poor experience with Donald 
Trump.
Tesoro runs a small 
architectural ?rm that Trump 
contracted in 2006 to design 
the Trump National Golf Club 
in New York. Initially, the proj-
ect was for a 20,000 square-
foot clubhouse, for which Tes-
oro’s ?rm charged $800,000. 
However, the project grew to 
be a 55,000 square-foot club-
house in four years. Tesoro 
charged $140,000 extra for 
the changes Trump had de-
manded he make to the origi-
nal design to create a larger 
building.
Tesoro, however, was told 
once construction was com-
pleted by a Trump Organiza-
tion executive that “Mr. Trump 
‘didn’t want to pay.’” After 
complaining, he was invited to 
the clubhouse he had designed 
to meet with two executives he 
had worked with. There, he 
found “the lobby packed with 
dozens of vendors and profes-
sionals — all invited for the 
same reason: to plead for their 
overdue money!” Eventually, 
he went into the ballroom 
to ?nd approximately 15 
members of Trump Organiza-
tion, who offered him $50,000 
instead of the $140,000 he 
had been seeking. After acqui-
escing to this payment, Tesoro 
made an invoice with the new 
amount and sent it to the or-
ganization. Again, Trump’s 
organization refused to pay.
At this point, Tesoro said, 
“I am beginning to recognize 
that is a game and I am los-
ing.” He then met Trump, 
who said that because Tesoro 
“was such a nice guy and such 
a good architect,” he would 
give Tesoro $25,000 instead 
of $50,000. Trump’s attorney 
informed Tesoro that while 
he was likely to win a lawsuit, 
Trump Organization’s legal 
team would drag the hearing 
“out for at least ?ve years and 
it will cost me more than it will 
be worth,” Tesoro noted in an 
email. Thus, he accepted the 
$25,000 for his work on the 
project.
Since he has a small 
business, Tesoro says that this 
shortchanging “was really 
painful.” The Trump campaign 
has not commented on this sto-
ry, even though a video where 
Tesoro shares this experience 
has been viewed on Facebook 
more than seven million times, 
according to Forbes.
Tesoro said he is sharing 
his story because he doesn’t 
want the American public 
to be duped by the promises 
Trump is making, as he was 
duped ten years ago. Trump 
often told him that the project 
would make him famous and 
would lead to numerous new 
projects for his business, none 
of which happened. “It has be-
come very clear that he can’t 
be trusted, can’t be believed 
to follow through and even try 
to make his promises happen,” 
Tesoro said.
Tesoro maintained, 
however, that he doesn’t hate 
Trump and found him conge-
nial to work with. In fact, he 
told Forbes that Trump was 
“nice and decent to me on an 
individual basis.” He also be-
lieves that Trump’s current 
demeanor is merely a ploy 
to garner attention from the 
public rather than a re?ec-
tion of Trump’s true person-
ality. “He’s an actor. He’s a 
fraud,” Tesoro said.
Based on his meetings with 
Trump, Tesoro simply ?nds 
him un?t for the presidency, 
if not a despicable human be-
ing. He emphasized Trump’s 
impatience, saying two min-
utes into the interview, “If he 
were sitting just as long as 
you and I are, he would start 
getting antsy.” According to 
Tesoro, he found Trump to 
be egotistic, whimsical, insis-
tent on unreasonable sched-
ules, and intolerant of anyone 
disagreeing with him.
Tesoro concluded that 
Trump “doesn’t have the 
patience to deal with the 
complexity of a golf clubhouse 
building. God knows he 
doesn’t have the patience to 
deal with the complexity of 
governmental challenges.”
Tesoro’s story came to light 
when he met a mother at his 
son’s elementary school and 
emailed her the story. One of 
her colleagues had a nephew 
who worked for the Clinton 
campaign. The campaign 
videotaped him for an hour, 
according to an interview he 
gave in Forbes, and released 
a three-minute video labeling 
Tesoro as one of Trump’s 
victims.
The primary reason Tesoro 
came to Carnegie Mellon was 
that Clinton is vulnerable in 
western Pennsylvania and he 
felt “that any good energy on 
behalf of the Clinton campaign 
here would be bene?cial,” said 
Tesoro.
In addition to studying 
architecture at Carnegie 
Mellon, he also taught at 
Carnegie Mellon for three 
years, earning a Teacher of 
the Week award from the Stu-
dent Senate in 1984. “I have a 
special feeling for CMU and a 
special relationship with Pitts-
burgh which makes me want 
to be here,” Tesoro said.
While Tesoro’s dealings 
with Trump has at least en-
abled him to be somewhat 
in?uential in the presiden-
tial election, his business has 
only been harmed. “I am still 
paying for it,” Tesoro said.

Two Carnegie Mellon faculty members receive funding for scienti?c research
Martin Gaynor selected to be a member of the National Academy of Medicine
Martin Gaynor, the E.J. 
Barone Professor of Econom-
ics and Public Policy at Carn-
egie Mellon University, has 
been selected to be a member 
of the National Academy of 
Medicine. This membership 
is one of the highest distinc-
tions awarded to scholars 
and professionals.
Gaynor is the former 
director of the Bureau of 
Economics at the Federal 
Trade Commission. Accord-
ing to a Carnegie Mellon 
press release, he also con-
ducts research which focuses 
on “competition, antitrust 
policy and health care mar-
kets.” He has testi?ed be-
fore Congress and “worked 
with the state of Pennsylva-
nia on its health innovation 
initiative.” He has also 
advised the governments 
of the Netherlands and the 
UK on “competition issues 
in health care.” Gaynor says 
that he ?nds enjoyment in 
the public service part of 
his work, as well as “pure 
intellectual satisfaction and 
joy that comes from dis-
covering something, ?gur-
ing something out” in his 
research.
As Ramayya Krishnan, 
dean of Carnegie Mellon’s H. 
John Heinz III College, com-
ments in a university press 
release, “It would be impos-
sible to overstate the impact 
Dr. Gaynor has on his ?eld 
and on our community.”

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
If you happened to notice 
individuals on campus on 
Oct. 25 with purple paint 
on their hands or face, then 
maybe you were also aware 
that October was National 
Domestic Violence Awareness 
Month. SAFE CMU, Spark the 
Movement, Vaasavi Unnava 
(Student Body President) 
and Aaron Gutierrez (Stu-
dent Body Vice President), 
and CMU Student Senate 
organized the Paint for a 
Purpose event. The event 
aimed to bring awareness to 
domestic violence in America 
where 20 people will experi-
ence physical abuse in some 
form per minute — amount-
ing to 10 million men and 
women per year according 
to the National Coalition 
Against Domestic Violence.
While statistics are always 
needed on issues like this 
in order to understand the 
magnitude of the problems at 
hand and to begin to construct 
plans to reduce these rates, 
their pure grandeur can take 
away from the humanity of its 
victims. For this reason, Jess 
Klein, coordinator of Gender 
Program and Sexual Assault 
Violence Prevention on cam-
pus, organized the exhibition 
titled “It Happens Here.” This 
exhibit centered around the 
survivors of sexual assault, 
detailing the stories of indi-
viduals and making sure we 
don’t forget the facts such as 
that one in four women and 
one in seven men will expe-
rience physical violence in 
their lifetime. This directly 
translates to individuals in 
our communities, dorms, 
family, and friends. In Klein’s 
own words, “domestic vio-
lence does not discriminate 
— it can happen to people 
of all races, genders, social 
classes, ages, and religions.”
Finally, Srishti Jain, 
Student Government’s Sexual 
Assault and Violence Preven-
tion advocate, recently re-
leased a video project titled 
Survivor to Survivor. In this 
video, survivors of sexual 
assault and relationship vio-
lence anonymously submitted 
words of hope, advice, and 
love they would give to other 
survivors in their communi-
ties and beyond. Students 
all across campus, including 
members of the Student Body 
President’s Cabinet and Un-
nava, came together to share 
the survivors’ messages. The 
result was posted online 
with the hopes that these 
words would reach those who 
needed it the most.
It’s always sobering to 
remember that Carnegie 
Mellon, which takes form as 
a home for so many, is cur-
rently being investigated for 
a Title IX violation — mean-
ing, at some point, a student 
has experienced discrimina-
tion after reporting a sexual 
assault on campus. So again, 
I must highlight the absolute 
relevance of all these amaz-
ing events and projects oc-
curring on campus. Sexual 
assault must always be taken 
seriously, not only because of 
its indiscriminate nature, but 
because we as a community 
must strive to ensure that 
our members always feel 
safe, or feel comfortable in 
expressing their discomfort.
If you have ever felt that 
these most basic require-
ments were not being met, 
please never hesitate to 
reach out to loved ones, or 
any of the members of Cabi-
net, many of whom are in 
the Survivor’s Support Net-
work. Have any ideas of other 
Sexual Assault and Relation-
ship Violence (SARVP) events 
that you would like to see on 
campus? Please contact Sr-
ishti Jain at srishtij@andrew.

Two faculty members of 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
B. Reeja Jayan and Hayden 
Schaeffer, have been grant-
ed research funding for 
three years by The Air Force 
Of?ce of Scienti?c Research 
through the Young Inves-
tigator Research Program 
(YIP).
Jayan, who is an assistant 
professor of mechanical en-
gineering, received a three-
year grant. She received the 
award for her work with 
electromagnetic ?elds in 
materials synthesis. Jayan 
leads a multidisciplinary lab 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. According to a Carnegie 
Mellon Press release, the 
lab is devoted to “molecular 
scale engineering of every-
day materials” to uncover 
new properties of existing 
materials as well as discov-
ering new materials. These 
discoveries could potentially 
lead to innovation in ?elds 
such as sensing and energy, 
and “the grant will help 
Jayan focus her research on 
ceramic materials.”
Schaeffer, who is an 
assistant professor in the 
Department of Mathemati-
cal Sciences, is also a mem-
ber of Carnegie Mellon’s 
reputed Center for Nonlin-
ear Analysis. He received 
a three-year grant “to sup-
port his work on sparse 
modeling, partial differen-
tial equations and machine 
learning,” according to a 
university press release. In 
Schaeffer’s project “Sparse 
Modeling and Machine 
Learning for Nonlinear Par-
tial Differential Equations,” 
he will be creating math-
ematical tools that will help 
scientists analyze and ex-
tract important information 
from experimental data.
The Young Investigator 
Program is open to all sci-
entists and engineers across 
the nation who demonstrate 
exceptional ability and 
promise in conducting basic 
research.

On Oct. 25, Carnegie 
Mellon opened the Swartz 
Center for Entrepreneurship. 
The event took place in Ran-
gos ballroom, on the second 
?oor of the University Center. 
The launch of the center is a 
highlight of this year’s bian-
nual LaunchCMU event which 
showcases entrepreneurial 
achievements at Carnegie 
Mellon University. The cen-
ter was made possible by the 
gracious $31 million donation 
by James R. Swartz. Through 
classes and activities, the 
Swartz Center will provide 
an opportunity for collabora-
tion across a range of disci-
plines through education and 
engagement.
This year’s LaunchCMU 
event was focused on the 
theme of “Smart Cities” and 
showcased how this idea came 
through business achieve-
ments and through innova-
tion by students, faculty, and 
alumni.
A place for ideas of 
students, alumni, and fac-
ulty to connect and grow, 
the Swartz Center will foster 
business growth on our 
campus. Carnegie Mellon al-
ready sets a great example 
in business; just last year, an 
impressive 38 startups were 
created from Carnegie Mellon 
University students and 
faculty members.
The Swartz Center can 
be a resource for students at 
any point during their time 
at Carnegie Mellon to be-
gin the journey to creating a 
startup. There are programs 
designed for ?rst-years, such 
as Entrepreneurship Boot-
camp, which could act as a 
catalyst to creating a startup. 
Professors can also bene?t 
from the resources of the 
Swartz Center to build con-
nections to continue research 
or receive grants. This is a 
useful resource for those in-
terested in entrepreneurship 
as it is meant to be useful to 
students of all disciplines, 
not just those focusing their 
studies in business.
In charge of running the 
center is executive direc-
tor Dave Mawhinney as well 
as faculty co-directors Le-
nore Blum and Jon Cagan. 
Additionally, a board of 
members of the national 
entrepreneurship community 
has been put together to 
provide their knowledge and 
guidance on the Swartz Cen-
ter’s path to success. Known 
as the Swartz Center Advisory 
Board, the members were also 
revealed at Tuesday’s event.
James R. Swartz is already 
a greatly appreciated mem-
ber of the Carnegie Mellon 
community. He is also a ven-
erable entrepreneur and a 
founding member of Accel 
Partners of Palo Alto, Califor-
nia. For the work he has done 
as member of Accel partners, 
a global venture capital ?rm, 
Swartz received the Lifetime 
Achievement Award from 
the National Venture Capital 
Association.
At Carnegie Mellon, 
Swartz is a member of Presi-
dent Suresh’s Global Advisory 
Council and the Tepper School 
of Business’ Board of Advi-
sors. Also, in 2013, Swartz 
received yet another lifetime 
achievement award, spe-
ci?cally the Lifetime Alumni 
Achievement Award from the 
Tepper School of Business. He 
received this in honor of his 
professional attainment and 
his dedication to education.
CMU’s new Swartz Center for Entrepreneurship is of?cially open
steps Carnegie Mellon takes to 
ensure diversity within the in-
stitution. “In academic units,” 
remarked Suresh, “we make 
sure that we attract the best 
and the brightest representing 
different perspectives, differ-
ent life experiences and dif-
ferent viewpoints.” Moreover, 
Suresh mentioned a sensitiv-
ity training program for the 
faculty members initiated last 
year to reinforce the respect 
and equality among mem-
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
community.
Diversity was a recurring 
theme of this open dialogue, 
and was brought up later in 
a question from Facebook 
regarding the rising under-
graduate tuition cost at the 
university. “The reason we 
cannot make [need-blind ad-
missions] a policy is because 
we do not have the resources to 
make it possible for all [quali-
?ed students with demon-
strated needs] to attend Carn-
egie Mellon,” said Suresh. He 
stressed that, because of the 
size and history of the univer-
sity, Carnegie Mellon’s endow-
ment at the moment is limiting 
its ability to achieve the same 
level of diversity as its peer 
institutions, but diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon has improved 
gradually over time.
The second question came 
from Daniel Gingerich, a Ph.D. 
student studying engineering 
and public policy at Carnegie 
Mellon, who raised a ques-
tion about gender parity in the 
graduate school of Carnegie 
Mellon. Gender parity was re-
peatedly mentioned by Suresh 
in his opening speech: female 
students made up an unprec-
edented 49.8 percent of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Class of 2020, 
and 48 percent of the ?rst-
year students in the tradition-
ally male-dominated School of 
Computer Science.
In response to Gingerich’s 
question, Suresh claimed that 
the Carnegie Mellon faculty 
and staff were “taking a pro-
active role” to include more 
women into ?elds such as 
engineering and computer 
science since women’s par-
ticipation in these ?elds is 
lacking. He stressed that this 
issue can only be resolved on 
a case-by-case basis, and that 
it requires the university “to 
have over a billion dollars” of 
funding to attract the more 
capable female scholars to the 
institution.
The settlement of the 
patent infringement law-
suit between Carnegie Mel-
lon University and Marvell 
Technology Group Ltd., which 
resulted in a $750 million 
payment to the College of En-
gineering earlier this year, was 
brought up in the Q&A session. 
Suresh explained that about 
one-third of the payment went 
towards the College of Engi-
neering, bene?tting depart-
ments such as Electrical and 
Computer Engineering and its 
sub-department Data Storage 
System Center (DSSC), where 
the invention took place; the 
rest would become part of the 
university-wide endowment 
used mainly towards support-
ing students instead of on in-
frastructure of the university, 
such as the Tepper Quad. The 
$200 million funding required 
to complete the Tepper Quad 
project would come entirely 
from fundraising.
Topics such as the physical 
and mental ?tness of Carnegie 
Mellon students and the uni-
versity’s relationship with their 
indirect employees through 
vendors were also discussed 
during the hour-long dialogue. 
At the end, President Suresh 
encouraged all members of 
the community to partake in 
improving the university as a 
whole. “We very much wel-
come you to join in this conver-
sation,” said President Suresh 
at the end of the dialogue, “not

The HistoryMakers is an 
online African-American oral 
video archive. With more than 
9,000 hours of searchable 
interviews and stories from 
more than 2,700 African-
American individuals in the 
nation, it is the largest of its 
kind in the world. It was initi-
ated by Julieanna Richardson, 
the executive director of The 
HistoryMakers, who started 
collecting interviews in 1999.
The content of the project 
is diverse: it relates to the 
?elds of science, education, 
entertainment, art, history, 
and many others. It is avail-
able for students and scholars 
at subscribing institutions; 
interviews are available to 
the public at the Library of 
Congress, which is The Histo-
ryMakers’ of?cial repository. 
Carnegie Mellon University 
was granted access to the ar-
chive as recognition for the 
university’s contribution in 
making the project. According 
to Richardson, “Carnegie 
Mellon University can 
single-handedly take credit 
for opening this collection for 
research and study ... I can’t 
say enough about Carnegie 
Mellon.”
The HistoryMakers is a 
major work in recording the 
history of African-Americans. 
According to Richardson, 
“Everybody who has seen the 
work has been blown away.” 
Professor Trotter from Carne-
gie Mellon University’s History 
Department became acquaint-
ed with the project in 2008. In 
an interview conducted with 
The Tartan, Trotter stated, 
“we sometimes overlook our 
recent history when we are 
thinking about the future. In 
the underground, even as we 
are speaking, there are out-
standing individuals doing in-
credible things, and we ought 
to be about recording both the 
older generation as well as the 
newer generation.” According 
to Trotter, the oral history re-
cord of lives of people in the 
late 20th century will offer ex-
traordinary insight and legacy 
for the study of history as well 
as for future generations.
Erika Linke, Associate 
Dean of Carnegie Mellon 
University’s school library, 
upon which the archive is en-
dowed, states “I loved Histo-
ryMakers from the ?rst time 
I used it. Resources like His-
toryMakers connect us with 
the past by hearing people in 
their own words, to see their 
expression and demeanor. We 
can read words but to hear 
the voice and to see an indi-
vidual speak is special. Valu-
able today but in future, it will 
become a vital record.”
One important feature of 
The HistoryMakers is that it 
is searchable electronically 
by an index name. In the ar-
chive, each video is brie?y 
presented as segments with 
transcripts; work done by 
Carnegie Mellon University 
enables users to directly jump 
to corresponding video refer-
ences that are mentioned in 
the transcription.
Trotter states “In the past, 
historians would need to 
listen to hours of tapes to 
identify particular topics or 
themes.” Trotter stated that 
this searchable feature is a 
dimension of the project that 
wasn’t thought of as possible 
when the project started. 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Entertainment Technology 
Center got involved in the 
project and helped to produce 
the technology that made 
these interviews searchable. 
He said that this feature is 
an “amazing innovation,” in 
that it “not only allows you to 
search for a particular topic” 
in a way that the archive is a 
tool that can be used by any-
one on any subject instantly, 
“but also allows you to ana-
lyze it through various lens-
es,” such as through regional 
differences, time differences, 
gender differences, and so 
on. “You can get into a lot of 
different variations on the Af-
rican American experience,” 
Trotter stated.
This dimension of the 
project “does underscore 
that technology is transform-
ing the research that we do,” 
Trotter said. “Digital human-
ity is becoming a big ?eld 
... It’s just good to have Af-
rican American wrapped in 
it among those projects that 
are employing these tools.” 
He believes that technology 
will unpack graduate train-
ing, teaching, and many other 
aspects of the study of history.
According to a university 
press release, in April, 
$725,000 was awarded to 
Brandeis University by the An-
drew W. Mellon Foundation 
for it to work with The Histo-
ryMakers and Carnegie Mel-
lon University, to modernize 
the digital archive. “Previous 
funding has come from the In-
stitute of Museum and Library 
Services and the National 
Science Foundation.”
As for the future and 
development of The Histo-
ryMakers, Michael Christel, 
who is a teaching professor 
at Carnegie Mellon working 
on digital humanities projects 
and games, says they aim to 
make the site responsive for 
mobile devices in February 
2017. Also, they want to en-
gage more students with the 
resources of The HistoryMak-
ers and “make it more visible 
through the experiences the 
ETC can offer.”
Professor Trotter stated 
that “The HistoryMakers 
project, as it stands, is 
national. You can look at 
people from all areas of the 
country, which means that 
you have only a few represen-
tatives from each area.” His 
goal is to integrate the local 
oral history projects into the 
national body of oral histo-
ries. According to him, right 
now they have over 180 in-
terviews with local Pittsburgh 
African-American people in 
their history project, which 
is a great resource for this 
national archive: in this way 
Pittsburgh is represented 
more fully. He believes that 
if this could be done across 
the country, it would enrich 
teaching, research, and even 
social services in history.
The CAUSE Remembering 
African Americans in 
Pittsburgh Oral History 
Project was originally direct-
ed by Benjamin Houston, who 
is a senior lecturer in mod-
ern U.S. history in Newcastle 
University in the UK. Professor 
Trotter says that they are “still 
collaborating on projects that 
brings programs at Newcastle 
and at CMU together.”

Presidential race looks close as Election Day approaches
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Layout Manager
As the 2016 presidential 
election descends upon us, 
the polling in the election is 
beginning to tighten but not 
everyone thinks it will be 
enough to save Republican 
candidate Donald Trump’s 
failing campaign. Most of the 
six major presidential fore-
casts put Democratic candi-
date Hillary Clinton up by a 
substantial margin. The Huff-
ington Post, Princeton Elec-
tion Consortium, and Daily 
Kos all peg Clinton’s chances 
of topping Republican candi-
date Donald Trump above 90 
percent. The New York Times 
and PredictWise are not too 
different, placing Clinton’s 
chances of winning in the 
mid-80s.
FiveThirtyEight, the most 
popular forecast, puts Clin-
ton’s odds closer to two out 
of three. FiveThirtyEight 
had Clinton’s chances sitting 
around 85 percent before the 
FBI Director James Comey 
sent a letter to lawmakers say-
ing that the FBI might have 
uncovered relevant evidence 
to the investigation regarding 
Hillary Clinton’s private email 
server. Trump’s odds began 
to rapidly rise after this when 
his polls began to improve. 
The reason given by FiveThir-
tyEight editor-in-chief Nate 
Silver for his forecast’s aggres-
sive reaction is twofold.
The ?rst is that the unusu-
ally high number of people 
who are undecided or voting 
third-party indicates a high 
level of volatility in polling re-
sults. Silver is always careful 
to mention that, for this same 
reason, FiveThirtyEight also 
predicts a higher chance of 
Clinton winning in a landslide 
than other models.
The second is that 
FiveThirtyEight’s model is 
programmed to react very 
aggressively to late trends in 
polling because polling runs 
out of time to capture changes 
in the electorate’s mindset be-
fore Nov. 8.
Similarly, outlets like CNN 
and Rothenberg and Gonzalez 
say that states where Clinton 
has a safe lead no longer make 
up more than the 270 elec-
toral votes needed to win the 
presidency.
The New York Times’ fore-
cast places 268 electoral votes 
in the “likely Democratic” cat-
egory. Those states are not a 
guarantee — Clinton’s lead 
continues to shrink in Colo-
rado and Pennsylvania — but 
if they end up going blue on 
election night, Hillary Clinton 
will need to win only one of 
nine competitive states or the 
second congressional district 
of either Maine or Nebraska. 
Trump’s leads in those con-
gressional districts as well as 
Ohio, Iowa, Utah, Arizona, 
and Georgia indicate that if 
those states go blue, there was 
probably some sort of poll-
ing error in Trump’s favor, 
and one of the four remain-
ing competitive states also 
likely went blue. This means 
that the battleground for 
this election is likely in New 
Hampshire, Nevada, Florida, 
and North Carolina.
Currently, all major fore-
casts but FiveThirtyEight and 
the Princeton Election Con-
sortium give Clinton more 
than a 65 percent chance 
to win each of those four 
competitive states. FiveThir-
tyEight gives Trump between 
a 50 and 55 percent chance of 
winning each of North Caroli-
na, Florida, and Nevada while 
they give Clinton an edge in 
New Hampshire. The Prince-
ton Election Consortium gives 
Clinton a nearly a three in four 
chance to win each of North 
Carolina and Florida while 
they consider New Hampshire 
and Nevada tossups.
Backers of both candidates 
are convinced that they have 
edges that the polls cannot 
capture.
Some of Trump’s sup-
porters feel that the polls are 
underestimating him for a 
variety of reasons. The most 
common are that the likely 
voter screen takes out Trump’s 
deepest pockets of support 
and that the media coverage 
of Trump has been so negative 
that people are embarrassed 
to say over the phone that 
they will vote for Trump.
Trump consistently under-
performed his polling in the 
primaries when likely voter 
screens and telephone inter-
view polling were used. Fur-
ther, Politico and Morning 
Consult released a study say-
ing that over the telephone 
interviews do not suppress 
Trump support. However, it’s 
no guarantee that general 
election polling would have 
the same errors as primary 
polling.
In Clinton’s corner, her 
campaign infrastructure gives 
her backers con?dence that 
she will manage the victory. 
Clinton has far more cam-
paign of?ces and a much more 
robust turnout operation than 
Trump, which could help her 
get more of her supporters to 
the polls.
Clinton also had a supe-
rior ground operation to her 
primary opponent, Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I-VT). While 
Clinton frequently outper-
formed her polls, she was also 
on the wrong side of several 
large polling errors. Iowa was 
essentially tied and Sanders 
won Oklahoma by a double-
digit margin despite Clinton 
leading both states in late 
polling. Most notably, Clinton 
seemed to be a lock in Michi-
gan where late polls had her 
up by margins ranging from 
11 to 37, but Sanders ended 
up narrowly taking the state. 
Michigan is among the states 
Trump is actively campaign-
ing to turn red to give himself 
some breathing room in the 
electoral map.
Clinton is anywhere from 
a heavy to an overwhelming 
favorite depending on who 
you ask, but the election is 
not quite over yet. Polls open 
on Tuesday, Nov. 8 and results 
will trickle in beginning at 6 
p.m. when polls close in Indi-
ana and Kentucky.

Republican Senate majority in jeopardy as Dems close in
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
This election season has 
been one of the most polariz-
ing and eventful seasons that 
America has seen in a while. 
With the presidential race tak-
ing a front seat, it is important 
to remember that Congress 
can either help or hinder the 
president. Of all the senate 
races happening in 2016, the 
most important are Nevada, 
New Hampshire, North Caro-
lina, Missouri, Wisconsin, In-
diana, and Pennsylvania.
Nevada
In the wake of Senate Mi-
nority Leader Harry Reid’s 
retirement, Nevada is look-
ing for someone to ?ll his 
spot. On the Democratic side, 
it could be former Attorney 
General of Nevada, Catherine 
Cortez Masto. Cortez Masto’s 
platform puts an emphasis 
on capitalizing on Nevada’s 
abundance of solar, wind, and 
geothermal energy. This not 
only puts an investment into 
clean energy, but into new 
jobs for the state. She also 
plans to push for immigration 
reform and make the path to 
citizenship easier in order to 
keep families together. Cortez 
Masto has previously fought 
against the Yucca Mountain 
nuclear waste repository, a 
dumping site for nuclear waste 
in Nevada’s Yucca Mountain, 
and plans to continue this 
?ght. If elected, she would 
be the ?rst Latina to serve in 
the U.S. Senate. Her fate now 
lies in how many of Nevada’s 
780,000 Latinos show up to 
the polls.
On the Republican side, 
there is two-term represen-
tative, Joe Heck. Heck is the 
candidate that Nevada Repub-
licans have been looking for 
to reclaim a Senate seat. He’s 
spent 35 years as a physician 
and brigadier general in the 
U.S. Army Reserve. As a previ-
ous small business owner him-
self, Heck promises to ?ght for 
small businesses and rid them 
of government regulations. 
Like Cortez Masto, he is in fa-
vor of clean energy and plans 
to advocate for this by pushing 
a bipartisan bill that stream-
lines the process of starting 
renewable energy projects. 
Heck is also a strong supporter 
of the Second Amendment. 
Similar to Cortez Masto, he 
also calls for immigration re-
form, but in a way that will in-
crease border security. Nevada 
has been slow to bounce back 
to economic stability, and the 
answer for some voters might 
be a change in party and a vote 
for Heck this election season.
New Hampshire
Incumbent Kelly Ayotte 
has some competition as 
New Hampshire has steadily 
become a more Democratic 
state. Ayotte, however, is a 
more moderate Republican 
that has steadily tried to dis-
tance herself from the right. 
Unlike many of her Republi-
can counterparts, she believes 
that climate change is real and 
has formed the Energy and En-
vironment working group to 
combat it. She’s also working 
to ?ght New Hampshire’s 
growing heroin and prescrip-
tion drug abuse epidemic. 
She helped co-author the 
Comprehensive Addiction and 
Recovery Act of 2015 which 
provided incentives to com-
munities to implement strate-
gies to combat addiction and 
she has a hand in several other 
projects that work to ?ght this 
issue.
Ayotte’s moderate efforts 
might not be enough to fend 
off her challenger, Democratic 
New Hampshire Governor 
Maggie Hassan. She is heav-
ily focused on bipartisanship 
and spent her time as gover-
nor passing two bipartisan 
budgets that kept New Hamp-
shire sales and income tax free 
while cutting taxes for small 
business research and devel-
opment. She also froze tuition 
at state universities and low-
ered it for community colleg-
es. She plans to approach the 
Senate the same way she’s led 
New Hampshire, by reaching 
across political line and put-
ting the issues ?rst.
North Carolina
Incumbent Richard Burr 
isn’t exactly guaranteed a 
third term in this purple state. 
Low approval ratings have left 
Democrats with the oppor-
tunity for a steal. However, 
in a state like North Carolina 
that has seen several Senate 
changes, anything is possible. 
Burr had previously served on 
the U.S. House of Represen-
tatives for ?ve terms before 
being elected to Senate. Dur-
ing his time in Senate, he was 
Chairman of the U.S. Senate 
Select Committee on Intelli-
gence and sat on the Health, 
Education, Labor, and Pen-
sions Committee and also the 
Finance Committee. He’s a 
strong advocate for military 
families and plans to hold the 
government accountable and 
not allow them to interfere 
with state legislation, a mind-
set that is integral to Republi-
can ideology.
Burr’s challenger, Deborah 
Ross, is no stranger to Wash-
ington. This former state rep-
resentative is highly focused 
on education because she be-
lieves that her public school 
education in North Carolina 
laid the framework for her to 
be who she is today. Ross be-
lieves in investing in the public 
school system and striving to 
make college more affordable.  
Despite being a second choice 
for most North Carolina Dem-
ocrats after former Senator 
Kay Hagan decided not to run, 
she still has a chance with Burr 
tied up in a scandal over PAC 
money.
Missouri
Incumbent Roy Blunt has 
been a Senator for Missouri 
since 2010. This former history 
teacher was elected to be Ma-
jority Whip much earlier than 
other members of Congress. 
Despite starting with this mo-
mentum in Congress, his re-
cent block of Supreme Court 
nominee Merrick Garland left 
many Missourians unhappy 
with his performance.
Blunt still has the slight 
edge in the polls over his 
competitor, but de?nitely has 
some work to do if he plans to 
keep his seat. He has some of 
the worst approval ratings in 
Congress, leaving most Mis-
sourians with a taste for some-
thing new.
Missouri Secretary of State 
and challenger Jason Kander 
seems to be the solution those 
unhappy with Blunt have been 
looking for. At 35, this mili-
tary veteran is the youngest 
statewide elected of?cial in 
America. He’s taken a biparti-
san approach to pass the ?rst 
major ethics reform Missouri 
has seen in almost 20 years 
and turned human traf?cking 
legislation in Missouri into 
some of the strongest in the 
country. Missouri has not vot-
ed for a Democratic president 
since 1992, but the state’s gov-
ernor, Jay Nixon, and other 
senator, Claire McCaskill, are 
both Democrats. Kander could 
help bring Missouri Demo-
crats to the polls once again on 
Tuesday.
Wisconsin
With incumbent Ron 
Johnson barely winning his 
seat in 2010 and not perform-
ing to Wisconsin’s expecta-
tions for him, his reelection 
is anything but guaranteed. 
He’s publicly known for con-
fronting Hillary Clinton dur-
ing the hearings on Benghazi. 
He’s also been known to call 
those who take out student 
loans lazy as he skipped his 
senior year of high school and 
worked full time while getting 
his degree. Johnson believes 
that the solution to most of 
Wisconsin’s problem is reduc-
ing the cost and scope of the 
federal government and that 
is what he went to Washington 
to do.
After losing to Johnson in 
2010, Russ Feingold is back 
for redemption. After advo-
cating for campaign reform 
in the form of the McCain-
Feingold Act and declining 
outside funds in 2010, he’s left 
that mindset behind in an at-
tempt to win the seat that he 
held from 1993–2011 back. 
Contrary to Johnson, Feingold 
has invested in Pell Grants and 
works to make college more 
affordable. His Achilles heel 
however, could be a scandal 
involving his lack of response 
to veteran deaths due to over-
prescription in Tomah, WI.
Indiana
The retirement of Senator 
Dan Coats has left way for two 
new challengers to rise. House 
representative Todd Young on 
the Republican side and Sec-
retary of State, two-term gov-
ernor, and two-term senator 
Evan Bayh on the Democratic 
side. Young, a former marine, 
says that what prompted him 
to run for of?ce was President 
Obama’s 2009 stimulus pack-
age and Obamacare in 2010. 
He promises to ?ght for small 
business owners, supports 
the second amendment, and 
is highly favored by the NRA. 
George W. Bush has also been 
campaigning for Young.
His challenger, Bayh,has 
very contrasting views. Af-
ter Rep. Baron Hill (D–IN) 
dropped out of the race, the 
job fell to Bayh who has not 
disappointed Indiana Demo-
crats. As the son of former 
senator Birch Bayh, he has a 
well-known name in Indiana. 
As governor, he was passed 
a large tax cut and reformed 
welfare programs. He plans 
to try and control government 
spending and strengthen our 
military if elected.
Pennsylvania
In a race that is very famil-
iar to most of us here on cam-
pus, incumbent Pat Toomey is 
up for reelection against Dem-
ocrat Katie McGinty. Despite 
trying to take a more socially 
moderate position moving 
forward, Toomey blocked the 
bill that would have placed 
restrictions for buying guns on 
those on the FBI’s no-?y list. 
Toomey has also been under 
heat for blocking Garland’s 
nomination to the Supreme 
Court. During his time in Con-
gress, he also had a hand in 
the Jumpstart Our Business 
Startups (JOBS) Act in 2012. 
Many Pennsylvanians have 
been dissatis?ed with his re-
cent performance, however, 
and are starting to wonder 
why they elected him in the 
?rst place.
McGinty is new to elected 
of?ce. This environmental-
ist and leader in clean energy 
could be Pennsylvania’s ?rst 
female senator, a fact that 
many Democrats hope will 
draw women to polls to vote 
for her and Hillary Clinton. 
After college, she worked with 
former Senator Al Gore (D–
TN) on the Clean Air Act.
She also previously chaired 
the White House Council on 
Environmental Quality in 
1993 in the Clinton adminis-
tration and as the Secretary 
of the Department of Environ-
mental Protection. She plans 
to continue her environmental 
efforts from Washington and 
to bring jobs to Pennsylvania 
through renewable energy.

November 7, 2016 « The Tartan thetartan.org/elections » A5
Democrats look to slim down Republican House majority
SINEAD FOLEY
Forum Editor
As Nov. 8 approaches, the 
nation’s attention is ?xed on 
the controversial, and some 
would say apocalyptic, presi-
dential election. On the rare 
occasions that people can tear 
their eyes from the dumpster 
?re of a presidential election 
they usually focus on the com-
petitive race for the Senate, 
where the Democrats have a 
shot at taking back the major-
ity. In the midst of all the cha-
os, it’s easy to forget that the 
entire House of Representa-
tives is also up for re-election.
To be fair though, this 
oversight is understandable. 
Republicans have a relatively 
safe majority in the House. 
The current balance is 247 
Republican seats to the Demo-
crats’ 188. Considering that, 
according to FiveThirtyEight, 
in the last election cycle two 
years ago all but 16 of those 
247 Republicans won their 
seats by at least 10 percent-
age points, giving Democrats a 
hard uphill battle if they want 
to reach the 218 seats needed 
for a majority. Back in 2010, 
when the last round of redis-
tricting took place, Republi-
cans gerrymandered the heck 
out of Congressional districts 
across the country, guarantee-
ing themselves a comfortable 
position for the next few elec-
tions. Redistricting won’t oc-
cur till 2020, so their majority 
seems pretty safe this year.
Even if Democrats don’t 
manage to pull off a miracle 
and take back the major-
ity, they could dramatically 
change the landscape of the 
House. 270 To Win currently 
predicts that Democrats will 
win 194 seats, with Repub-
licans getting 225 seats and 
16 races still too close to call. 
Meanwhile, the Cook Political 
Report rates 22 Republican 
seats as toss ups, likely to turn 
Democrat, or leaning Demo-
crat, as opposed to only four 
Democrat seats in danger of 
?ipping.
Of particular interest to 
Democrats are the races in 
California’s 49th and Florida’s 
7th. The 49th and the 7th both 
feature high level Republicans 
suddenly caught in the reelec-
tion races of their lives.
Republican Rep. John Mica 
of Florida’s 7th had a good 
thing going until last year 
when Florida’s Supreme Court 
struck down the congressio-
nal district lines drawn by the 
Republican-led state legisla-
ture for unconstitutional ger-
rymandering. Now he’s facing 
a district much younger and 
more Democratic than he is 
used to. A Democratic win in 
the 7th could be a harbinger of 
good things to come on elec-
tion night.
The 49th features House 
Oversight Committee Chair-
man Darrell Issa. Taking out 
a committee chairman would 
be a big win for Democrats, 
and taking out Issa, who has 
been one of President Obama’s 
most ardent critics (he once 
called Obama one of the most 
corrupt presidents in history) 
would de?nitely be satisfying. 
Issa has won his seat by double 
digits for the last eight elec-
tions, but has suffered from 
the “Trump effect.” While 
Issa supports Trump, most 
Californians don’t. This race 
highlights the ways Trump 
has changed the political land-
scape even down ballot, put-
ting previously safe districts 
up for grabs.
Of course, it’s not all bad 
news for Republicans. The 
GOP has a chance to pick up a 
seat in Nebraska’s 2nd district, 
where freshman Rep. Brad 
Ashford is facing off against 
Republican Don Bacon. The 
2nd is about as purple as it 
gets, with Obama taking the 
district in 2008 but Romney 
carrying it in 2012 according 
to the Cook Political Report’s 
Partisan Voting Index. A Re-
publican win here would help 
shore up the Republican ma-
jority against losses in other 
districts. Still, Ashford is a 
moderate Democrat with a 
history of working across the 
aisle in a district that is lean-
ing towards Clinton on the 
presidential level, so it’s a hard 
?ght.
All in all, things are looking 
good for Democrats. Putting a 
dent in the Republican major-
ity would force Republicans to 
reach across the aisle more, 
particularly considering how 
fractured the Republican Party 
is these days. If a fragment of 
their party refuses to support 
a bill, Republican leadership 
will no longer be able to push 
it through anyway and will 
have to bend to some Demo-
crat requests to get bipartisan 
support.
So, what does this all mean 
for people voting in Pitts-
burgh? To be honest, not much 
on the House level. Pittsburgh 
is in Pennsylvania’s 14th dis-
trict and is represented by 
Mike Doyle, a Democrat run-
ning for his 12th term in Con-
gress. He is running against 
Lenny McAllister. McAllister 
ran in the Republican primary 
for Illinois’ 2nd congressional 
district in 2013 but lost and 
has now shifted his sights and 
his residence to Pennsylvania. 
This race is rated as safely 
Democrat by almost every ma-
jor poll. Still, it’s worth keep-
ing an eye on how House races 
play out across the country 
since legislation is all about 
compromise, and it matters 
who our representatives are 
compromising with.

United States Code speci?cal-
ly states that voter intimida-
tion at any election in which 
a federal position is being 
determined is punishable by 
?ne, jail, or both. This is why 
different groups of states have 
banned ?rearms, prohibited 
partisan advocacy, and, in 
Montana, banned the offering 
of alcohol or tobacco near or 
inside a polling place. This is 
also why the Democratic par-
ties of Arizona, Ohio, Nevada, 
and Pennsylvania can sue the 
Trump campaign for advocat-
ing for voter intimidation — it 
is unequivocally illegal. Voter 
intimidation is a relatively 
easy to identify example of 
voter suppression. The other 
methods of voter suppression 
are much less clear-cut and 
much more legal.
Legal voter suppression 
is something of an American 
tradition. The Constitution 
may have been written of, by, 
and for the people, but until 
1870 “the people” was more 
or less synonymous to “white 
men.” Eventually, of course, 
the 15th and 19th amend-
ments gave the constitutional 
right to vote to women and 
people of color.
A year after enfranchis-
ing black men, in the midst 
of reconstruction, Congress 
passed the Ku Klux Klan Act 
of 1871, a law over 100 years 
old and still relevant. The Col-
fax Massacre, where the Ku 
Klux Klan (KKK) attacked and 
killed up to 153 lawmakers 
and freed African-Americans 
at a courthouse, sparked the 
bill, which authorized the 
prosecution of the KKK and 
anyone else who violated 
the 15th amendment. These 
prosecutions dropped signi?-
cantly as federal troops drew 
out of the south at the end of 
Reconstruction. Voters of col-
or continued to be subject to 
suppression in the form of the 
poll tax, the literacy test, and 
the danger threatened and re-
alized against them and their 
families. This, along with the 
continued effort of the civil 
rights movement, lead to the 
passing of the Voting Rights 
Act of 1964.
Half a century later, at 
least twenty states have 
passed legislation that enable 
voting restrictions. Fourteen 
of these states have passed 
stricter legislation since the 
2012 election. This summer, 
Arizona passed a bill restrict-
ing mail-in ballot collection. 
The argument that accom-
panies these laws is almost 
always that they are there 
to stop the epidemic of voter 
fraud. The Republican nomi-
nee’s recent call to arms also 
follows this argument.
A study af?liated with Ari-
zona State University found 
that, between 2000 and 
2012 there were only 500 
cases of in-person or absen-
tee voter impersonation, or 
1 in 300,000 votes. Applied 
to the 146,311,000 Ameri-
cans registered to vote in this 
election, that would predict 
487 instances of voter fraud. 
The largest actual example 
of voter fraud in recent his-
tory was the purging of 12 
thousand names, 44 percent 
of which were African-Ameri-
can, from Floridian voter rolls 
due to the fact that the named 
matched listed felons in other 
states. The year was 2000, 
and George W. Bush won the 
presidency by 537 Floridian 
votes.
It is effectively impossible 
to rig the U.S. Presidential 
election, no matter how much 
voter fraud is committed. This 
is not due to restrictive laws, 
but to the fact that the elec-
tion is actually, between all 
50 states, their multitude of 
counties, and the District of 
Columbia, a few thousand 
elections. These laws have 
no signi?cant effect on voter 
fraud, but they do have an 
important effect on voting. 
Restrictive laws calling for 
stricter voter identi?cation 
requirements, early voting 
cutbacks, and registration re-
strictions overwhelmingly af-
fect voters of color.
After the 2008 election, 
which had unprecedented 
turnout from people of color, 
the country saw the rise of 
voter suppression laws. A 
University of Massachusetts 
study found that the greater 
the rise in minority and low-
income voter turnout, the 
more likely a state was to pass 
restrictive laws. The Brennan 
Center for Justice found that 
seven of the eleven states with 
the highest African-Ameri-
can turn out and nine of the 
twelve states with the largest 
Hispanic population growth 
established new restrictions 
to voting by 2014.
This disparity of impact is 
important because of what 
happens when people vote 
— politicians actually listen 
to them. Politicians pay atten-
tion to who votes because they 
want to stay in power, and 
catering to the people who 
have shown that they actually 
vote gives them that power. 
Take, for example, the years 
following the Voting Rights 
Act. Unprecedented numbers 
of African-Americans voted 
and, as a result, politicians 
noticed, and African-Ameri-
can communities got public 
funding for their roads to be 
paved and their stoplights to 
be ?xed.
The United States likes to 
pride itself in the pure-heart-
ed nobility of its democratic 
process. This year, however, 
the Republican nominee has 
spent a lot of energy claim-
ing that the election is rigged, 
and has made a number of 
comments calling for voter 
intimidation and suppres-
sion. This parallels the acts of 
discrimination and injustice 
mentioned earlier. Pennsyl-
vania, as one of the states the 
Republican nominee singled 
out in his calls to “watch your 
polling booths,” has already 
seen and will undoubtedly see 
more voter intimidation until 
tomorrow is over.
Tomorrow, there will be 
people who did not vote who 
were eligible to. It won’t be 
because they didn’t want 
to vote, but because they 
couldn’t. At this moment in 
the United States, voting is 
not a right — it is a privilege.
Voter suppression remains prominent in U.S. electionsFBI reviewing new evidence in Clinton email investigation
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
On Oct. 28, the Federal 
Bureau of Investigation (FBI) 
began reviewing new evi-
dence in its investigation into 
the email scandal that has 
dogged Democratic presiden-
tial nominee Hillary Clinton 
during this election cycle.
The FBI’s decision stems 
from the discovery of new 
emails that had not turned 
up during the course of the 
FBI’s initial investigation. “In 
connection with an unrelated 
case, the FBI has learned of 
the existence of emails that 
appear to be pertinent to the 
investigation,” FBI director 
James Comey said in a note 
to congressional committee 
chairs. “I am writing to in-
form you that the investiga-
tive team briefed me on this 
yesterday, and I agreed that 
the FBI should take appro-
priate investigative steps de-
signed to allow investigators 
to review these emails to de-
termine whether they contain 
classi?ed information, as well 
as to assess their importance 
to our investigation.”
The decision to look fur-
ther into the investigation 
of Clinton’s emails stems 
from the discovery of these 
emails during the bureau’s 
investigation into one of the 
former New York congress-
man Anthony Weiner’s sex-
ting scandals. During their 
investigation into allegations 
that Weiner had sent sexual 
messages to a 15-year old girl 
in North Carolina, the FBI 
seized a laptop that contained 
emails exchanged between 
Huma Abedin, Weiner’s es-
tranged wife and a top Clin-
ton aide, Clinton, and other 
members of the Clinton cam-
paign. While many contend 
that most of these emails will 
be duplicates of those already 
turned over to the FBI, the 
FBI will go ahead with in-
vestigating the new pieces of 
evidence.
Further compounding 
headaches over the email 
scandal include continued 
releases from Wikileaks. One 
email from then-CNN con-
tributor and current DNC 
interim chairwoman Donna 
Brazile gave Clinton aides 
a question that would be 
asked in advance of a Mar. 6 
debate against Senator Ber-
nie Sanders (I-VT). A later 
email showed that Brazile in-
tended to “send a few more.” 
Wikileaks has vowed to pub-
lish 50,000 hacked emails 
before the election concludes, 
though it is unlikely the FBI 
will take them into consider-
ation in its investigation.
What remains to be seen 
is if this October surprise will 
dramatically impact the elec-
tion tomorrow. An October 
surprise is something that 
happens the month before the 
election that can change the 
race or cement a candidate’s 
victory. The term ?rst came 
to use in 1972 after National 
Security Advisor Henry Kiss-
inger held a press conference 
saying “peace is at hand,” 
referring to the Vietnam War. 
In 2004, a video from Osama 
bin Laden put the spotlight 
on the War on Terror, helping 
President George W. Bush win 
reelection. In 2012, Hurricane 
Sandy served as the October 
surprise, as President Barack 
Obama immediately went to 
work doing what he could 
to help mitigate the disaster, 
drawing praise from New Jer-
sey Governor Chris Christie. 
Americans then decided that 
the president could be trusted 
with four more years in of?ce.
Republican presidential 
nominee Donald Trump has 
pushed the narrative that the 
Democrats can’t be trusted, 
specifying Clinton’s emails 
and an average 25 percent 
increase in health insurance 
premiums for midlevel bench-
mark Obamacare plans be-
fore subsidies. The polls have 
tightened up, as shown by the 
changes in the Real Clear Pol-
itics national average from a 
4.6 point Clinton lead on Oct. 
28 to a 1.6 point Clinton lead 
on Nov. 4.
Still, early voting may 
mitigate the damage done to 
the Clinton campaign, and at 
this point, most voters have 
already come to grips with 
either accepting Clinton’s 
?aws over Trump’s, refusing 
her in support of Trump, or 
opposing both major party 
candidates. It is not likely that 
any major revelations will 
come within such a short time 
frame that can dramatically 
change anyone’s mind on who 
the next president will be.

This electoral season is probably 
one of the most important to vote 
in. Pennsylvania has been the site 
of several different campaign visits, 
with both Hillary Clinton and her 
running mate Tim Kaine visiting 
Carnegie Mellon and First Lady Mi-
chelle Obama visiting the University 
of Pittsburgh on the campaign trail. 
There have been several voices tell-
ing our student body about how im-
portant it is to vote in the presiden-
tial election, but The Tartan wants to 
remind everyone that your vote can 
also have an impact on issues that 
are a lot closer to home.
One important issue that Pennsyl-
vanians need to look out for on Nov. 
8 is the Mandatory Judicial Retire-
ment Age, which The Tartan wrote 
about in last week’s issue. This ballot 
measure proposes to change the re-
tirement age for state judges from 70 
to 75 years old. The measure is word-
ed in such a way that it implies that 
there is not currently a retirement 
age. Extending the age by ?ve years 
only serves to allow justices to hold 
onto their seats longer than neces-
sary. It is important for the popula-
tion at Carnegie Mellon to pay atten-
tion to this measure because these 
justices will make decisions that they 
might not live to see, but will have an 
impact on the younger generation. 
Pennsylvania Republicans are capi-
talizing on the fact that people will 
read the measure and think they’re 
enacting a voting age rather than ex-
tending one. A vote against this man-
date could turn into a judicial ruling 
in favor of those who will be around 
to see it in the long run.
Another important reason to vote 
is because of the Senate election be-
tween Katie McGinty and incumbent 
Pat Toomey. The Tartan previously 
called for Pat Toomey to do his job 
and allow Merrick Garland’s nomi-
nation to the Supreme Court to  go 
to a vote in the Sennate. Toomey has 
continued to be a disappointment to 
Pennsylvanians with his vote against 
a bill that would have blocked sus-
pected terrorists from buying guns. 
McGinty is an environmentalist that 
has long been an advocate for clean 
energy. With the poll numbers in 
this election changing almost daily, 
it is still anyone’s guess who will join 
Sen. Bob Casey (D-PA) in Washing-
ton. A vote for Senate is almost as im-
portant, if not more important, than 
a vote for president. No matter who 
wins the presidency, they can only 
be as active as the Con-
gress that is behind 
them.
The mindset 
that any vote does 
not matter is deeply 
?awed. There are several 
issues at stake here, and 
a vote on Nov. 
8 could be 
the decid-
ing factor 
in an impor-
tant state-level 
court case or a bill 
passing through Senate. Pennsyl-
vanians have been unhappy with 
Toomey’s decisions, but he didn’t 
get to his position on his own; voters 
put him there. If voters want to see 
change, they have to get out 
and vote for someone 
who won’t block 
the president’s 
constitutional 
duty of appoint-
ing  Supreme 
Court nominees. 
This is 
an impor-
tant elec-
tion, and 
The Tartan 
urges every-
one to go out 
and vote!

On Oct. 21, Pittsburgh public 
schools of?cials released a report 
that included of?cial K–12 enroll-
ment information for public schools 
in the Pittsburgh area. The report 
showed that overall Pittsburgh pub-
lic school enrollment, as of Oct. 1, 
has fallen by 353 students in 2016, 
a 1.49 percent drop in enrollment. 
The losses came from all three divi-
sions of K–12 education — 242 in 
K–5, 122 in middle school, and 37 
in high school.
The report also explains that 
this dip in enrollment is not an iso-
lated problem. Pittsburgh’s low 
2016 public school enrollment ?ts 
into a general trend in Pittsburgh’s 
public education. Over the last ?ve 
years overall enrollment has steadily 
dropped each year, falling 6.97 per-
cent decrease in total.
Despite these overall decreases, 
however, the report also showed 
several individual schools with 
signi?cant enrollment increases. 
Pittsburgh Schiller (6–8) gained 19 
students, and Pittsburgh Lincoln’s 
total enrollment (K–5) increased 
from 217 to 227. Pittsburgh Wool-
slair (PreK–5) showed particularly 
signi?cant increases. In 2013, Wool-
slair was the smallest school in the 
district, not including special/online 
programs, with only 110 students. 
Since then, however, Woolslair’s en-
rollment has increased 74.5 percent, 
putting Woolslair’s enrollment above 
other previously larger programs, 
such as Pittsburgh Manchester (K–8) 
and Pittsburgh Weil (K–5).
These increases could be attribut-
ed to several factors, but many have 
linked these successes with the inte-
gration of STEAM — science, tech-
nology, engineering, arts, and math-
ematics — programs. After initial 
plans to close Woolslair due to poor 
enrollment, the school board voted 
in September of 2014 to turn the 
school into a partial STEAM magnet 
school, with STEAM curricula taking 
effect during the 2015–2016 school 
year. Nearly $900,000 was granted 
to the project, which also involved 
the implementation of STEAM pro-
grams at Schiller and Lincoln and 
an eventual extension to Perry High 
School the following year. The plan 
involved hiring two STEAM instruc-
tors for the four schools and devel-
oping a STEAM curriculum for each 
school.
Shaun Tomaszewski, the dis-
trict’s STEAM coordinator, explained 
that the grant money was used “to 
renovate existing physical spaces, to 
provide faculty with professional de-
velopment and to purchase instruc-
tional materials they might need to 
implement the curriculum.” 
The STEAM curriculum, an ex-
tension on the traditional STEM 
curriculum, is centered around proj-
ect-based learning, with students 
completing extended modules in 
newly-installed STEAM labs. “Our 
current vision for STEAM education 
is to provide experiences where kids 
will eventually not just participate in 
the economy as consumers of things, 
but have the capacity to really be 
makers of things,” Tomaszewski said. 
“We’re … committed to spreading 
this innovation to all of our buildings 
so these STEAM mini-grants will be 
available for individual teachers or 
principals so that they can develop 
STEAM activities and learning expe-
riences for kids in their own spaces.”
The implementation of STEAM 
curricula in these schools follows 
previous implementation of STEM 
programs in both public and private 
schools throughout Pittsburgh. 
Schools such as the Summer Gam-
ing Academy have already bene?tted 
from the integration of STEM prin-
ciples. In 2011, a $10,000 grant from 
the Grable Foundation was awarded 
to the Summer Gaming Academy 
to upgrade the school’s computer 
lab and develop an Entertainment

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Important issues hang in balance of Nov. 8 election
BRANDON SCHMUCK
After Staffwriter Caleb 
Glickman’s response to my defense 
of the independent millennial, I 
continue to hold my stance that vot-
ing third party is a plausible choice 
that stretches far beyond what he 
describes as “idealism.” In fact, in 
many ways it could be a more ra-
tional decision than voting from 
the cesspool of choices that the two 
party system has provided us with.
Glickman credits the three 
branches of government as a solu-
tion that “brings many political di-
mensions and ideals to the table.” 
He continues, “...they do not form 
their own parties just because they 
disagree on a few issues. They ?nd 
common ground with their fellow 
lawmakers.” In this sense, he is en-
tirely correct. In fact, the rate at 
which they ?nd common ground is 
so high, that the idea that they are 
representing multiple political di-
mensions and ideals is ludicrous. It 
has become taboo to vote against 
your party as a legislator. This is 
why our nation has become so po-
larized, and why according to a USA 
Today survey, despite the fact that 
Trump is all that Glickman has men-
tioned and more, he continues to be 
endorsed by all but 26 percent of Re-
publican federal lawmakers.
Data compiled by the Wash-
ington Post from GovTrack 
puts into perspective just how 
often members of Congress vote 
along their party lines. On the House 
side, Republican Walter Jones leads 
with the most votes against his 
party, with more than 33 percent 
of his votes against the majority. In 
the Senate, this number is even less, 
with Democrat Joe Manchin voting 
against his party just over 25 per-
cent of the time. This means that the 
most diverse-in-thought Democrat 
in the Senate votes with his party 
three out of four times.
If these numbers were the norm 
for most members of Congress, the 
argument could be made that this 
is not actually that bad. However, 
when only four senators and 11 
Representatives voted against their 
parties more than 20 percent of the 
time, the idea that they represent a 
diverse crowd of thought and deci-
sion making could not be more false.
Glickman mentions that “par-
ties can shift in their ideology when 
more lawmakers endorse a particu-
lar idea. If a voter feels left out of a 
coalition, he should support legisla-
tors in the coalition he most agrees 
with.” I agree that parties tend to 
shift towards more popular ideolo-
gies in order to win votes, but as I 
mentioned in my previous article, if 
you want to really change the way 
a party operates, withholding your 
vote from it is no doubt the most ef-
fective way. The power that a large 
group of people can have by with-
holding votes from a political party 
is much more than that of simply vot-
ing for a candidate you dislike that 
has already been placed in front of 
you. Because politics is their career, 
most members of Congress are not 
strictly tied to any political ideology 
and will shift positions on issues in 
order to win back large populations 
of voters that they have lost.
Perhaps the line that deserves 
the most attention in Glickman’s ar-
ticle is the following:
“On the morning of Nov. 9, how 
will you feel if your new president-
elect is Donald Trump, a racist, mi-
sogynist, bullying, thin-skinned, 
xenophobic, ignoramus … who 
has boasted about being a sexual 
predator.” The length of the quote 
clearly depicts Glickman’s agenda 
through his articles, not in promot-
ing even a system of two choices, 
but one with what he believes to be 
a clear-cut choice: Hillary Clinton 
or Hillary Clinton.
While I agree with much of this 
quote and am myself quite scared of 
a Trump presidency, a quick search 
through the WikiLeaks Hillary Clin-
ton Email Archive will show you 
just how I will feel on the morn-
ing of Nov. 9 if Clinton is our new 
president-elect. Her responsibility 
for Benghazi, lack of understanding 
of how to handle classi?ed informa-
tion, close ties with Wall Street, and 
lies about her mishandling of classi-
?ed information are as frightening, 
if not even more frightening than 
the junk that spews out of Trump’s 
mouth. 
All of these actions that have 
caused obvious security threats to 
our country make it hard for me 
to believe that Clinton is “the only 
person in this race we can trust to 
lead the land of the free.” While a 
Trump presidency would be more 
than damaging, we’ve seen from 
Clinton’s time as Secretary of State 
that her presidency could turn out 
just as badly.
I can sympathize with Clinton 
supporters and their desire to keep 
Trump from the White House, but 
I can also understand why those in 
rural communities are equally as 
afraid of a Clinton presidency. Ac-
cording to a Reuters poll in August, 
41 percent of those outside of urban 
areas supported Trump, and only 
28 percent supported Clinton. This 
should be of little surprise when 
Clinton has directly called out rural 
blue collar Americans with quotes 
like, “We’re going to put a lot of coal 
miners and coal companies out of 
business.” For the small-town Amer-
ican, as jobs are leaving and heroin 
overdoses and economic issues 
plague their towns, it is clear why 
the message “Make America Great 
Again” is so appealing.
My goal is not to stand up for 
Trump or any of his ridiculousness, 
but to put things into perspective. 
Trump and Clinton are both ter-
rible in their own ways and present 
a polarization of this nation. I don’t 
wish to present alternative options 
like Gary Johnson, Jill Stein, or even 
Joe Exotic as ideal solutions to the 
problem, but I hope for you to open 
your eyes and look at the real pros 
and cons of all options available, 
whether it’s Republican, Democrat, 
Libertarian, or candidates of any 
other political af?liation.

SYDNEY ROSLIN
This Tuesday, the country will 
once again cast their votes for presi-
dent, following an election season 
that has had U.S. citizens up in 
arms. The decision should be an 
easy one. After all, when given a 
choice between a former Secre-
tary of State and New York Sena-
tor who has spent a lifetime ad-
vocating for families and women’s 
rights and a business mogul who 
has faced bankruptcy four times, re-
peatedly made racist and sexist com-
ments, and is best known by the gen-
eral public for ?ring people on reality 
TV, it is obvious who would be able to 
better lead this country.
So why does Donald Trump still 
hold 43 percent in the polls, accord-
ing to the New York Times? Hillary 
Clinton is currently leading, sure, 
but why is Trump even enough of a 
thought in the minds of U.S. citizens 
to potentially challenge her?
The answer is sad and simple: 
there is inherent sexism in U.S. poli-
tics, a dangerous double standard 
that has tainted the political sphere 
since its inception.
In terms of this election, we are far 
past talking about issues. Of course, 
the U.S. population is divided on the 
issues. Yes, Trump represents the Re-
publican Party and the Republican 
platform, and U.S. Republicans prob-
ably are more likely to agree with 
Trump’s stances on the economy, gun 
control, health care, etc. If this was 
another election, another 
candidate, a 
question 
of Democratic vs. Republican plat-
forms, this could be a conversation 
about issues.
This year is a conversation is about 
how a racist, sexist man who runs his 
campaign through a combination of 
fear-mongering and outright bullying 
is actually being considered for presi-
dent. This is a conversation about 
how if Clinton had said or done even 
a fraction of the things that Trump 
has said and done, she would no lon-
ger be considered for president.
Imagine a world where Clinton 
was recorded on 
tape saying 
that she forced herself upon men. Or 
a world where Clinton had been sued 
for racial housing discrimination. Or 
a world where Clinton blacklisted 
major newspapers from getting press 
passes to her rallies because they 
spoke poorly of her in their publica-
tions. She certainly would not have 
43 percent of the vote, nor be consid-
ered ?t to run this country by anyone.
Yet somehow, Trump, who 
has done 
all of this and much more, is still in 
the running. Somehow, these scan-
dals are overlooked by almost half of 
the country. Trump is not held to the 
same moral standards as Clinton.
In the public eye, Clinton has to 
pull off a balancing act. She must 
be seen as strong enough to run the 
country, but warm enough to be re-
latable and trustworthy. She has to 
?ght Trump and take power of the 
debates but she cannot 
react to the yelling and 
outright insults that 
he throws out at her. 
Meanwhile, Trump 
supporters applaud 
him for “speaking his 
mind” or for “taking 
charge.” Trump never has 
to worry about appearing 
“relatable.”
The difference here is that Clin-
ton is not only being judged for her 
campaign or for her knowledge — 
she is also being judged on the fact 
that she is female. In the minds of 
a fair portion of the country, she 
is being judged on if she makes a 
good president and if she makes a 
good woman. Trump, meanwhile, 
does not face this type of scrutiny. 
He is judged on his presidential 
potential, of course, but there is 
no one comparing him to what he 
should be as a man.
As a country, we are far from 
being able to vote gender-blind. It 
will still be years before people will 
stop marrying someone’s political 
potential to their gender. But we can 
start by realizing that, no matter his 
gender, Donald Trump cannot be al-
lowed to be president.

Technology Center. Similar to 
Woolslair, the Summer Gaming 
Academy, which initially started 
at approximately 30 students, had 
a projected enrollment of 170 stu-
dents the following year due to the 
implementation of new technology. 
Other developments within the Eliz-
abeth Forward School District also 
exhibit the growth of STEM educa-
tion, including the development of 
the YOUMedia center, which lets 
students interact with digital media, 
and the SMALLab (Simulated Media 
Arts Learning), which incorporates 
motion-capture cameras and wire-
less controllers to let students play 
games with images projected onto 
surfaces throughout the lab.
This increased presence of STEM-
type programs represents a general 
shift away from liberal arts educa-
tion, which teaches students gen-
eral skills including critical thinking 
as well as written and oral commu-
nication skills. While the integration 
of STEM and STEAM programs have 
undoubtedly brought many bene?ts 
to a variety of struggling schools, it 
is important that schools don’t for-
get the importance of liberal arts 
education in their haste to incorpo-
rate technical curriculum. Cutting 
out liberal arts education might 
not seem problematic initially, but 
students who are exposed only to 
STEM or STEAM education can miss 
out on important bene?ts.
Research conducted in 2013 by 
Hart Research Associates on behalf 
of The Association of American Col-
leges and Universities, for example, 
explains the potential bene?ts of a 
liberal arts education. The research 
entailed a survey of business 
and nonpro?t leaders, and not-
ed that 80 percent of employ-
ers feel that students should 
receive broad knowledge of 
the liberal arts and sciences. 
The report cites critical think-
ing, communication, and 
interpersonal skills as im-
portant results of a liberal 
arts education, claiming 
that 93 percent of em-
ployers surveyed say 
that “a demonstrated 
capacity to think critically, commu-
nicate clearly, and solve complex 
problems is more important than [a 
candidate’s] undergraduate major” 
and 95 percent say that they want to 
hire individuals with “ethical judg-
ment and integrity; intercultural 
skills; and the capacity for contin-
ued new learning.”
These results demonstrate the 
desire for non-technical skills, which 
points out the problem with purely 
technical education. Students who 
are technically intelligent, but lack 
important skills such as written and 
oral communication, are at a dis-
advantage. Even in technical jobs, 
individuals are required to interact 
with others and present their ideas, 
which requires strong communica-
tion and interpersonal skills. The in-
creased focus on STEM education in 
K–12 schools is providing promising 
bene?ts, but we need to make sure 
that schools aren’t completely aban-
doning the liberal arts. By inte-
grating STEM educa-
tion with broad liberal 
arts concepts we can 
educate intelligent, 
well-rounded indi-
viduals who have 
both the techni-
cal skills and 
the nontech-
nical skills 
required to 
function in 
society.

Are you aware that your beloved 
computer or laptop can be used as a 
weapon to abet a cyber-crime? With-
out your knowledge, your system can 
become a part of a botnet!
Hang in there for a moment — a 
botnet?
While I am sure that by now the 
tech geeks might have understood 
the reference I am trying to make, 
for others I will just let the cat out of 
the bag. It has already been four sen-
tences! A lot of suspense here.
Well, a botnet is a network of in-
fected computers that is controlled 
as a group by someone who does not 
have authorized access. This hap-
pens when computers on the inter-
net are infected with some malicious 
software which compromises the se-
curity of the systems, thereby letting 
the attacker take the advantage of 
the vulnerability.
The severity of this kind of situ-
ation (where you are not in control 
of your computer) cannot be under-
stated. It not only causes massive 
damage to the internet but also poses 
a security threat to the systems that 
are connected to the internet. For 
example, your personal information 
can be leaked.
With the advent of Internet of 
Things (IoT), which is a concept of 
internet where everyday objects 
have network connectivity for their 
communication, we have started re-
lying more on the internet. Our de-
pendency has increased to such an 
extent that today we are not just lim-
ited to using the internet on comput-
ers or cell phones; we use the inter-
net in CCTV cameras, DVR players, 
coffeemakers, and even toasters! 
The point here is that as the digi-
tal devices that use internet capabili-
ties keep increasing, the user base 
keeps growing. Every user adds a 
little more information to the pool 
of information that is already out 
in the open waiting for a hacker to 
break-in.
The power of IoT is vested in the 
‘things’ that are the devices we keep 
adding to the internet space. But, 
can IoT always be this powerful? I 
guess the answer is no!
On Oct. 21, major parts of the U.S. 
suffered a massive internet outage 
because of a severe distributed de-
nial of service attack (DDoS). DDoS 
exploits the capabilities of the bot-
nets to ?ood a server with hundreds 
and thousands of page view requests 
impairing the server’s ability to func-
tion properly and hence causing the 
server to fail and collapse.
Experts claim that this attack 
was one of the largest cyber-attacks 
in history. What makes it remark-
able is its source, the Mirai botnet, a 
new weapon which is not based on 
computers, but on the devices that 
make up the (IoT).
The Mirai botnet was comprised 
of the devices present in the IoT. If 
each device in the IoT was a data 
point, the Mirai Botnet had 100,000 
data points! Imagine these data 
points coordinating and operating 
in cohesion to carry out an attack on 
a server, the strength of the attack 
and its impact would be signi?cantly 
large.
With an extraordinary attack 
strength of 1.2 TBps, the Mirai bot-
nets brought down the Internet 
single-handedly by attacking the 
servers of an Internet Performance 
Management company called Dyn. 
This company is the Domain Name 
System (DNS) provider for a large 
number of websites in the U.S. and 
acts as a switchboard for the inter-
net. DNS translates a website’s ad-
dress into a numerical address that 
allows systems to communicate with 
each other. DNS makes the internet 
operable.
Popular sites like Net?ix, Spotify, 
Twitter, and the Financial Times use 
the services from Dyn and they all 
crashed because their DNS provider 
was under attack. When users sent 
requests to the access those sites 
(Net?ix, Twitter, etc.) no response 
was generated. There was a huge 
disruption in their services. Another 
software company called Dynatrace 
also suffered this attack and out of 
150 websites that it monitors, 77 
were affected. According to CNN, 
this disruption has caused the com-
panies a loss of up to $110 million in 
revenue and sales.
According to me, Mirai Botnet can 
be one of the worst nightmares in the 
world of internet and information 
security. Mirai Botnet harnesses the 
power of a network that has almost 
5.5 million new things getting con-
nected to it every day.
Can you imagine how powerful 
this botnet is?
Before you start to think hard, 
let me provide you one more item to 
your thought palette.
On Nov. 3, Mirai Botnet launched 
an attack on a small African country, 
Liberia. Seems like the Mirai Botnet 
attackers are onto something big! 
According to a security researcher, 
targeting a small nation might be the 
best place to conduct tests for cyber-
weapons and check their effective-
ness for larger attacks.
The real motives behind any of 
these attacks are not known. The 
Mirai attackers have launched their 
two main attacks very wisely. The 
?rst on Dyn had so many data points 
that it is a tedious task to track and 
investigate each data point, the sec-
ond on Liberia had to few data points 
to arrive at any concrete conclusion. 
There is no information available on 
the internet about the reason behind 
these attacks except for the fact that 
the investigation is ongoing.
While no personal data has yet 
been compromised by any of these 
attacks in the U.S. or Liberia, the 
concerns of information privacy and 
security have re-surfaced. There is 
no assurance that our information 
on the web is safe and the thing that 
concerns me is that we are helpless.
It is scary how every day we be-
come a little more dependent on IoT, 
and a little more prone to the risk of 
losing our very personal data. It is 
a case where there is no perfect in-
between. You cannot be more depen-
dent on the internet without being 
less likely to be cyber-attacked.
According to David Fidler, ad-
junct senior fellow for cyber security 
at the Council on Foreign Relations, 
the insecurity of IoT devices is a 
grave issue and there are no effective 
measures to deal with it.
One might say that adding securi-
ty features to the devices in IoT might 
work. Well, agreed! But to what ex-
tent? The world will have 50 billion 
connected devices by 2020 and with 
the next 1 million devices coming 
online, formulating a security mea-
sure for each device would be a te-
dious task. A decent approach would 
be to have the right knowledge about 
handling these devices, but we can-
not expect everyone to be proactive 
or ef?cient in learning and handling.
Technology has made almost ev-
erything simpler for the humanity, 
but I believe that IoT is a case where 
simplicity has brought in complexity 
that is dif?cult to simplify.
Until there are strict strategies to 
combat IoT security issues, we are 
left with two options. Either to not 
use devices that belong to IoT (Silly? 
Right!) or to take a leap of faith and 
take security measures at our end 
(leaving the rest to fate).
With the frequent cyber-attacks 
by Mirai botnet, I just hope that we 
do not come across a new Mirai at-
tack in next few weeks. Mirai has 
revealed the vulnerabilities in the 
IoT framework and I feel that these 
should be ?xed or attended to before 
Mirai hits us again, making us weak-
er than we already are.

Heart cells can be regenerated  in low-oxygen environments
A healthy heart is normally 
supplied with oxygen-rich 
blood. However, the heart 
muscle cells of adult mam-
mals, or cardiomyocytes, typi-
cally do not divide because 
exposure to oxygen damages 
these cells. Using this infor-
mation, researchers at the 
University of Texas South-
western Medical Center found 
that after placing adult mice 
in a controlled, low-oxygen 
environment for two weeks, 
their heart muscle began to 
regenerate. The cardiologists 
lowered the oxygen level from 
the normal 21 percent to 7 
percent, which is similar to 
the oxygen level at the top of 
Mount Everest. They found 
that over time, the number 
of cardiomyocytes increased, 
and heart function improved. 
Scientists could potentially 
generalize the ?ndings to oth-
er organs as well. The entire 
study can be found in Nature.

High-speed 2D and 3D printing improved
New technology developed 
at Pennsylvania State Univer-
sity’s College of Engineering 
has improved printing speeds 
by a thousand-fold — 3D 
printing that used to take an 
hour takes seconds, and print-
ing 20,000 pages in 2D takes a 
minute. The researchers used 
“a space-charge-controlled 
KTN beam de?ector,” which is 
a crystal that, at an extremely 
high temperature, can in-
crease scanning speed from 
microseconds to nanoseconds. 
The lead researcher and 
professor of electrical engi-
neering, Shizhuo Yin, stated 
that this new technology 
would immensely bene?t the 
medical ?eld by making re-
al-time high-speed imaging 
possible. The complete ?nd-
ings were published in the  
September issue of Scienti?c 
Reports.

Patient treatments personalized with biological datasets
Scientists are developing 
tools to link the information 
a genome provides with large 
biological datasets to pin-
point gene activity and output 
at speci?c times and places. 
While useful in many aspects, 
a genome by itself only pro-
vides a simplistic map of our 
genes that tells us what could 
happen. 
However, in combination 
with the proteome, or the set 
of an organism’s proteins, 
the metabolome, or the set 
of an organism’s metabo-
lites, and many other omes, 
scientists can predict how 
individuals will respond to 
certain treatments under cer-
tain environments. This will 
help the medical industry 
personalize treatments for 
individual patients, and can 
help the agricultural industry 
to engineer crops to survive 
harsher conditions.

Turning plants into explosive detectors  now possible
Scientists at the 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology turned a spinach 
plant into an explosive de-
tector by placing tiny carbon 
tubes in its leaves. As the plant 
takes up water through its 
roots, the chemicals found in 
landmines, or nitro-aromatics, 
are absorbed as well. 
The scientists then shine a 
laser onto the leaves to stimu-
late the nanotubes to emit 
?uorescent light detectable by 
an infrared camera, or even a 
smartphone camera without 
the infrared ?lter. 
Currently, the reach of the 
signal is limited to one meter, 
but the researchers are work-
ing to increase the distance. Its 
applications include monitor-
ing terrorist activities in public 
spaces. 
The results are published in 
the journal Nature Materials.

New model of the Earth-moon system explains degrees
Scientists have been 
attempting to rationalize 
the oddly far orbit of Earth’s 
moon and its unusually large 
orbital tilt, but so far, the 
models have not completely 
explained the current state of 
the Earth-moon system. Past 
research has suggested a mod-
el in which the moon smooth-
ly transitioned away from 
Earth’s equatorial plane to the 
“ecliptic” plane after the ex-
plosion that created the moon, 
but does not explain the ?ve-
degree tilt of the moon from 
the ecliptic plane. A recent 
paper suggests that the explo-
sive impact that created the 
moon also tilted Earth to a 60- 
to 80-degree angle. As time 
passed, the Earth stabilized to 
its 23.5-degree angle we ob-
serve today, and the moon, as 
it abruptly shifted away from 
Earth, oscillated about the 
ecliptic plane, explaining the 
?ve-degree tilt.

New warnings released about e-cigarettes
Public health authorities 
in the United States have long 
stood by the claim that vaping, 
or smoking electronic ciga-
rettes (e-cigarettes), is dan-
gerous. This, in addition to the 
fact that e-cigarettes are not as 
effective in satiating the ad-
diction to nicotine, has led to a 
decline in sales of e-cigarettes. 
The warning is meant to pre-
vent young people from start-
ing the habit of vaping, but as 
a result also discourages peo-
ple from using e-cigarettes to 
quit smoking. A British medi-
cal organization claimed that 
e-cigarettes are 95 percent less 
harmful than cigarettes, but 
many Americans are under the 
impression that e-cigarettes 
are equally, or even more, 
harmful as cigarettes.

Carnegie Mellon, Yale develop new gene-editing system
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University and Yale 
University have developed 
a new, minimally invasive, 
gene-editing system that can 
be used to cure genetic blood 
disorders in live mice. As op-
posed to other gene-editing 
technologies such as clustered 
regularly interspaced short 
palindromic repeats (CRISPR) 
and zinc-?nger nucleases, 
this technology uses an IV 
treatment and does not mu-
tate genes that weren’t meant 
to be mutated. This system 
uses peptide nucleic acids 
(PNAs), synthesized poly-
mers comprised of a protein 
backbone with DNA and RNA 
nucleotides attached to it.
CRISPR has been hailed 
as the “most important 
innovation in the synthetic 
biology space in nearly 30 
years” and the interest in it as 
measured with respect to pat-
ents, scienti?c publications, 
and government funding has 
skyrocketed since 2013, ac-
cording to a Washington Post 
article. However, CRISPR’s 
method of using the immune 
systems of bacteria to identify 
and modify certain DNA se-
quences at a speci?c site has 
its drawbacks. 
It uses DNA-cutting en-
zymes to cut open a slice of 
DNA and then change it. First, 
these enzymes cannot be in-
serted effectively into a living 
body, unlike PNAs. CRISPR 
involves taking the affected 
cells outside the body, treating 
them, and then placing them 
back into the affected region. 
Second, while treating the 
cells, the enzymes might affect 
cells with similar sequences 
and create sporadic, unwant-
ed mutations.In an of?cial uni-
versity press release, Danith 
Ly, a professor in the Depart-
ment of Chemistry at Carnegie 
Mellon, explained, “We have 
developed a system that uses 
FDA-approved nanoparticles 
to deliver our PNA molecule 
along with a donor DNA to re-
pair a malfunctioning gene in 
living mice. This has not been 
achieved with CRISPR.”
The system developed by 
Carnegie Mellon and Yale 
overcomes both of these prob-
lems using PNAs. The system 
is comprised of nanopar-
ticles that are safe to inter-
act with living tissue, which 
contain PNAs and donor 
DNA. PNAs are also synthe-
sized nanoparticles that are

Recently Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Lord Professor of Chem-
istry Neil M. Donahue and 
his group publishe a study in 
the early online edition of the 
Proceedings of the National 
Academy of Sciences show-
ing that semi-volatile organic 
compounds (SVOCs) can dif-
fuse into “glassy” atmospheric 
particles, which means they 
are chunky like glass. Under-
standing these processes for 
how atmospheric particles 
grow and react is crucial to 
understanding topics such as 
how pollutants spread and 
the impact of pollutants on 
climate change and human 
health.
The word “volatile” means 
that a compound has high 
vapor pressure at room tem-
perature and thus evaporates 
into gaseous form very easily. 
By extension, semi-volatile 
means that the compound is 
not as volatile as a compound 
that would be considered 
volatile, and has a generally 
bigger molecule than a com-
pound considered volatile.
The atmosphere naturally 
contains billions of aerosols. 
Aerosols are small, non-gas-
eous particles from natural 
sources, such as ?res or sea 
spray, or arti?cial sources, 
like car emissions. The afore-
mentioned semi-volatile com-
pounds can react and diffuse 
into the naturally-occurring 
aerosols that inhabit the air. 
The density of all of this at-
mospheric organic matter 
increases as more and more 
chemical reactions proceed. 
As the density increases, so 
does its potential to contrib-
ute to climate change and 
harm human health.
The bulk of the actual lab-
oratory work in this study was 
done by Qing Ye, a chemistry 
doctoral student. She used 
single-particle mass spec-
trometry to look at a mixture 
of two compounds that are 
both formed from the oxida-
tion of organic compounds: 
toluene, often found in gaso-
line and industrial solvents, 
and alpha-pinene, a molecule 
naturally given off by pine 
trees. One of the compounds 
was isotopically labeled, 
and the populations of each 
compound were measured 
over time. The experiments 
showed that both compounds 
diffused easily, but toluene 
only diffused easily if the hu-
midity was above 30 percent.
“Our work shows that 
some glassy particles are kind 
of crunchy when they are dry, 
but they turn gooey when 
they get wet; under most 
conditions, the semi-volatile 
compounds will diffuse into 
particles quite easily,” said 
Donahue in a university press 
release.
Before this study, it was 
not scienti?cally conclusive 
as to whether SVOCs were 
able to diffuse onto “glassy” 
atmospheric particles. This 
study has demonstrated that 
the SVOCs are indeed able to 
travel under certain condi-
tions, which are dependent 
on the origin of the SVOC par-
ticles themselves.
In many parts of the world, 
air pollution is an increasing 
concern  in addition to hav-
ing the potential to cause an-
thropogenic climate change, 
it also poses a more direct risk 
to health. The results of this 
study are a key step to achiev-
ing greater understanding of 
these issues that affect our en-
tire planet.

HOW THINGS WORK
GENES, from A8
New gene-editing method developed
basically the nucleobases of 
DNA and RNA attached to a 
protein backbone. This al-
lows them to bind to the DNA 
in the affected region with 
high af?nity, without actually 
cutting the DNA at the site. It 
simply opens up the double-
stranded DNA and performs 
it function. The nano-particle 
delivery system that PNAs 
can be used with has been ap-
proved by the United States 
Food and Drug Administra-
tion and used successfully to 
treat neurodegenerative dis-
eases in humans.
Ly and Raman Bahal, a 
former graduate student, 
together with Peter Galzer’s 
team from Yale University, 
created the nano-particles 
that contained the PNA 
which, on binding to the tar-
get site, created DNA-PNA-
DNA triplexes after displac-
ing a DNA strand. 
This triplex then 
creates a fa-
vorable 
environ-
ment 
for the 
donor’s 
DNA to 
bind to 
the faulty 
DNA site in 
the locality. This 
was tested on genes 
that cause beta-
thalassemia, a 
blood disorder 
wherein the 
lack of he-
moglo-
bin 
in 
the body creates acute oxy-
gen shortage throughout the 
body and induces fatigue, 
weakness, and other severe 
issues.
This resulted in increased 
hemoglobin levels for several 
months after treatment and 
a success rate of 7 percent in 
gene-editing. 
This is signi?cantly higher 
than the current commonly 
used methods, which report 
a success rate of only 0.1 per-
cent. 
In the press release, Ly, 
referring to the results, said 
“The effect may only be 7 per-
cent, but that’s curative,” He 
explains. “In the case of this 
particular disease model, you 
don’t need a lot of correction. 
You don’t need 100 percent 
to see the phenotype return 
to normal.” The reports of 
this research were published 
in the journal Nature Com-
munications.

In years past, if you heard 
an amazing tune playing, 
you would rush to the clos-
est person to you, with one 
question: “What’s the name 
of this song?” Others would 
alternatively type as many lyr-
ics as they could discern into 
Google’s search bar, only to 
realize with much dejection 
that they had heard the wrong 
words altogether. Nonethe-
less, technology, as it so often 
does, has solved this recurring 
problem of the unknown song 
with an app called Shazam.
When a song is playing and 
a person wants to discover 
its name, they pull out their 
phone, launch Shazam, and 
start recording. After ?ve to 
ten seconds, the title of the 
song pops up on the screen, 
accompanied by other infor-
mation pertaining to it such 
as the artist, album, artwork, 
and year of release. Admit-
tedly, this process elicits awe 
every time, but it is very much 
grounded in the realm of com-
puter science.
Shazam was founded in 
1999 by Chris Barton and 
Phillip Inghelbrecht, both 
University of California, Berk-
ley students, along with Av-
ery Wang, who was a digital 
signal processing Ph.D. stu-
dent at Stanford University. 
Dhiraj Mukherjee also joined 
the team from a ?rm located 
in the U.K. In 2002, before 
smartphones picked up, a user 
had to dial “2580” on their 
phone while holding it up to 
the music, and the user then 
received an SMS text with the 
song title and artist name. In 
2008, Shazam became  one of 
the ?rst apps on Apple’s new 
App Store. Shazam employs 
a four-step process to detect 
audio picked up by a phone’s 
microphone. 
Firstly, according to their 
website, Shazam Entertain-
ment Ltd. keeps a large data-
base of 11 million songs and 
their unique “?ngerprints.” 
A ?ngerprint is the distinct 
sound wave pattern of an au-
dio excerpt .
Next, the user records 
whatever it is he or she wish-
es to be identi?ed, then the 
sound wave of the recording 
is compared to the database 
of stored ?ngerprints until a 
match is found. When a match 
is found, the information con-
nected to that correlation in 
the database is returned to the 
user. If a match is not found, 
as is often the case in noisy 
environments and for obscure 
music, an error is returned. 
The ?ngerprint of a  song’s 
audio is saved as a spectro-
gram, which is a time-fre-
quency graph of a wave. This 
is a crucial step in converting 
the analog sound wave into a 
digital format that Shazam’s 
scripts can read and compare. 
Shazam is not the only nor is 
it the ?rst app to perform this 
function. 
Several competitors exist, 
such as Google Sound Search, 
SoundHound — which 
detects songs by having users 
hum and Amazon’s Fire?y. 
Shazam is, however, the most 
successful and ubiquitous 
of the bunch. Its service has 
expanded beyond detection 
of only music, to movies, TV 
shows and adverts.
Shazam offers a glimpse 
into an exciting future for por-
table technology. 
Security, the internet of 
things, user interfaces, and 
voice commands are ar-
eas that could bene?t from 
Shazam’s model. Today, 
similar technology is already 
being used to unlock phones 
using voice.
Shazam is an indispensable 
utility on phones for millions of 
users. It has been downloaded 
ten million times, and correctly 
identi?ed songs over 15 billion 
times. The modern marvel that 
is Shazam exempli?es and is a 
reminder of the power of inge-
nious computing. Now, there’s 
no need to ask that nearby per-
son for the name of a catchy 
song: one can just Shazam it.

PUGWASH
DDoS attack noticeably compromises mainstream websites
    
Isabelle Vincent/Junior Staff Artist
ROB MACEDO
Special to The Tartan
Last week, a wide scale 
Distributed Denial of Service 
(DDoS) attack struck the in-
ternet, shutting down major 
websites such as Twitter for 
small, yet noticeable, periods 
of time. 
The DDoS attack was 
aimed at Dyn, an internet in-
frastructure companny based 
in New Hampshire. Dyn is a 
Doman Name System (DNS) 
services company. The inci-
dent took place in the form of 
three repeated attacks in one 
day, which ?ooded Dyn’s  in-
ternet directory servers with 
malicious requests from mil-
lions from servers. These at-
tacks lead to internet disrup-
tions over the East coast and 
some parts of the West coast. 
In an article on the popular 
technology magazine Wired, 
Dyn described the attack as 
“very sophisticated and com-
plex.”
A DDoS attack is 
characteristically simple; it 
involves simply overwhelming 
a server with requests, much 
like blocking an entrance to a 
building by sending too many 
people through the door at 
once. Usually, large compa-
nies with formidable ?rewalls 
can prevent such simple raids.
Thus, DDoS attacks are effec-
tive because they attack chan-
nels of communication such as 
routers and servers as oppsoed 
to attacking a single website.  
Yet, the fact that a DDoS 
attack successfully disrupted 
so many mainstream websites 
raises concerns regarding the 
safety of the internet. If such a 
simple attack — when execut-
ed artfully — can shut down 
major websites, how much 
damage could a more sophisti-
cated hack cause? 
Consequently, how should 
we conduct ourselves online 
when web security protocols 
are vulnerable to the most 
forceful of breaches?
Furthermore, the recent 
attcks on Dyn have been re-
ported to be of a class of DDoS 
that infects objects on the IoT 
(Internet of Things). Thus, as 
the world begins to move to-
wards greater IoT connectiv-
ity, it becoms harder to moni-
tor what information we put  
out over the internet.
The current design of the 
internet may be inherently 
insecure, as the web was not 
built with air-tight security in 
mind. Perhaps the only way to 
be safe is to take security into 
your own hands, and not to 
rely on the security provided 
by others to protect you. 
Furthermore, fully secur-
ing the internet may be det-
rimental to one of the most 
critical functions of the web: 
increasing our freedom to in-
formation. 
The security vs. freedom 
tradeoff is an old debate, but 
perhaps it is no more preva-
lent than when considering 
the consequences of a “100 
percent hack free” net. For 
example, a fully secure inter-
net would require some sort of 
authority to decide what may 
be allowed and what is not. 
Is this truly what we desire 
the internet to be? Access to 
boundless information may, 
by its very nature, give oth-
ers endless access to our 
own information.
Technology may not be 
the ideal solution to internet 
vulnerabilities. We may have 
a social problem, rather than 
a scienti?c one. If individu-
als do not take responsibility 
into their own hands, techno-
logically securing online in-
teraction without sacri?cing 
freedom of information may 
be futile. In this sense, inter-
net security can be considered 
a social engineering problem. 
We must teach people how 
to be vigilant online, and how 
to protect their information. 
These practices can be very 
simple, such as not opening 
emails from unknown senders 
with hundreds of recipients. 
Yet, many of these protocols 
are far from common sense. 
Furthermore, online resources 
could be designed to ease the 
process of securing one’s data.
Nonetheless, even if these 
procedures are widely adopted, 
it is still naive to assume our 
information would be impen-
etrable. How should our gov-
ernment communicate critical 
and con?dential information, 
which could have catastrophic 
repercussions if leaked? 
The recent email scandal 
involving Hillary Clinton only 
underscores the tremendous 
vulnerabilities in networked 
systems. Linking servers to-
gether on isolated networks, 
not unlike the “ARPANET,” 
is most likely the solution 
our government currently 
implements. 
Yet even these net-
works are vulner-
able, though it is 
perhaps a step 
in the right di-
rection. Ask-
ing our leaders 
to fully isolate 
their information 
to non-networked 
devices could simply 
be too infeasible for realistic 
implementation, and we must 
accept that there is a small, 
but certainly present, chance 
that our country’s most crucial 
security can be stolen.
A solution may lie within 
the benevolence of major 
software corporations. 
For example, Google 
will alert users if it ap-
pears that their com-
puter has become a 
“zombie,” i.e. a computer 
that has been maliciously 
hijacked to execute 
attacks such 
as DDoS 
on other 
sys-
tems. 
In this 
sense, 
the 
future 
may 
belong to 
“white-hat hack-
ers:” an almost priest-like 
group of individuals who 
bestow knowledge of techno-
logical security unto the mass-
es, and who alert the 
populace when 
cyber evils 
are present. 
Due to the complexity of 
internet security, we may have 
no choice but to surrender our 
freedoms to 
these 
“anointed” individuals.
But such a future is far from 
optimal and will 
be resist-
ed by 
those 
who 
wish 
to 
un-
der-
stand and 
maintain their 
security privately. Like many 
topics discussed at Pugwash, 
the solution may lie within 
society, and not technology. If 
we wish to live our online lives 
protected from malicious in-
tents, without heavily relying 
on external sources of knowl-
edge for our every trans-
action, we must educate 
individuals on all relevant 
matters of online security. 
It may also help if we re-
frained from opening emails 
sent by Nigerian Princes, no 
matter the potential monetary 
reward.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on the DDoS attack.

Football
The Carnegie Mellon 
football team went on the road 
this weekend to the University 
of Chicago where they took 
down the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) opponent 
with a score of 37–24. This 
win moves the Tartans to 6–3 
overall, with a 1–1 record in 
UAA play and a 5–2 record in 
President’s Athletic Confer-
ence (PAC) play.
Chicago made the ?rst 
move in this game, scoring 
halfway through the ?rst quar-
ter on a short run into the end 
zone. The Tartans answered 
in the second quarter with a 
short run of their own by junior 
running back Sam Benger. The 
game continued to go back 
and forth as Chicago scored 
another ten points in the sec-
ond quarter after Benger’s 
touchdown. The third quarter 
saw each team trade scores, 
but Benger ended the period 
with a bang with a long run 
for a touchdown as the teams 
headed into the home stretch. 
The Tartans were still down 
14–24 heading into the fourth 
quarter though, and they had 
their work cut out for them.
The Tartans were not af-
fected by the score de?cit, 
however. Banger’s touchdown 
at the end of the quarter along 
with the Tartans’ fourth quar-
ter scores add up to 30 un-
answered points. The fourth 
quarter trouncing began with 
an interception by junior line-
backer Kyle Brittain who took 
the ball 85 yards down the ?eld 
for the score. Three minutes 
later, the Tartans found them-
selves knocking at the door of 
the end zone again. Banger 
got the ball on a handoff and 
punched in a ten yard run to 
cap off a drive that spanned 
85 yards in three plays. The 
Tartans then got the ball back 
in the opposing red zone and 
capitalized quickly with an 
11-yard run from Benger. This 
put the Tartans comfortably in 
the lead with a score of 35–24, 
but they weren’t done. With 
less than two minutes left to 
play, the Tartans managed to 
back their opponents against 
their own goal and eventually 
made a safety to top off their 
incredible fourth quarter per-
formance and take the win 
37–24. The Tartans will play 
their ?nal game of the regular 
season on Saturday, Nov. 12. 
They will travel to Cleveland, 
Ohio to take on UAA rival 
Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity. The All-Academic Bowl is 
scheduled for 2 p.m.
Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon 
volleyball team took the court 
on Saturday to compete in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) championship game 
against Emory University. 
This was Carnegie Mellon’s 
third appearance in the UAA 
championship game, and the 
21st-ranked Tartans fell to the 
eighth-ranked Emory Eagles 
3–0. This puts the Tartans’ re-
cord at 25–7 on the year.
The Eagles won the ?rst set 
25–18, and the ?nal two with 
a score of 25–17 in each. The 
Tartan offense was led by se-
nior Jackie Gibbons with nine 
kills, and junior Eliza Donahue 
with six kills. Senior Emily 
Newton contributed 22 assists 
on the night while senior li-
bero Molly Higgins recorded 
16 digs.
Now the Tartans must wait 
for a bid to the 2016 NCAA 
Division III Championship, 
which is set to begin on Thurs-
day, Nov. 10. The bids are giv-
en during the NCAA selection 
show as an at-large bid. The 
Tartans can be proud of this 
season’s performance, even 
without the NCAA bid.

SPORTS BRIEFS

---------------------------------------------------

A12 « thetartan.org/sports The Tartan » November 7, 2016
Pro athletes publicly endorse the presidential candidates
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
With the U.S. presidential 
election looming, some might 
be curious about who their 
favorite (or least favorite) 
athletes and sports ?gures 
are supporting for president. 
While curiosity is all well and 
good, you should not base 
your vote by who athletes are 
supporting. They have their 
political opinions, and you 
should form your own based 
on your own values and re-
search. If you’re looking for 
information on who to vote 
for, don’t read this article; try 
the Election section instead.
With that disclaimer out 
of the way, here are some 
noteworthy supporters of the 
presidential candidates in the 
world of sports.
Hillary Clinton
Unsurprisingly, most pub-
lic votes of con?dence are 
directed toward Democratic 
nominee Hillary Clinton.
Her support from the NBA 
is solid from the top executives 
to elite players. NBA com-
missioner Adam Silver has 
supported Clinton with do-
nations. Cleveland Cavaliers 
forward Lebron James gave 
a strong endorsement for her 
and campaigned for her in the 
crucial state of Ohio, a state in 
which no Republican has ever 
become president without 
winning. Hall of Fame center 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar penned 
an opinion piece in the Wash-
ington Post in support of her, 
and Hall of Fame guard Magic 
Johnson has helped her with 
fundraising.
Elsewhere in the sports 
world, retired U.S. Soccer 
forward Abby Wambach has 
been campaigning for Clin-
ton in New Hampshire. Hall 
of Fame running back Jim 
Brown has been helping Clin-
ton win over Ohioans. Finally, 
former New York Yankees 
shortstop, third baseman, and 
designated hitter Alex Rodri-
guez has given an individual 
maximum $2,700 contribu-
tion to the Clinton campaign. 
Though he had endorsed 
2012 Republican presidential 
nominee Mitt Romney in the 
last election, it seems like he, 
like many other Republican 
supporters, has decided to 
cross party lines as a result of 
the tumultuous election cycle 
2016 has been.
Donald Trump
Republican nominee Don-
ald Trump has had a share of 
sports ?gures in his corner, 
many of them coming from 
the NFL.
New England Patriots 
quarterback Tom Brady has 
shied away from a full out en-
dorsement of Trump, but he 
has spoken about his friend-
ship with Trump and has had 
a hat in his locker bearing 
Trump’s campaign slogan. For 
what it’s worth, Trump has 
reciprocated that friendship, 
lambasting NFL commission-
er Roger Goodell’s suspension 
of Brady for De?ategate and 
the appellate court decision 
to restore said suspension.
Buffalo Bills guard Richie 
Incognito tweeted out sup-
port for Trump, saying he was 
on his way to a rally before 
echoing President Ronald 
Reagan’s campaign slogan. 
Former wide receiver Terrell 
Owens also gave Trump his 
support.
Former Denver Broncos 
and Washington Redskins 
head coach Mike Shana-
han hosted a fundraiser for 
Trump. Bills head coach Rex 
Ryan introduced the can-
didate at a rally by saying, 
“We’re all here because we 
support Donald Trump.”
Former NFL quarterback 
and current left ?elder for 
the Scottsdale Scorpions Tim 
Tebow has indicated support 
for Trump, though he de-
clined an invitation to speak 
at the Republican National 
Convention in Ohio.
Elsewhere in sports, Olym-
pic shooter Kim Rhodes has 
been in support of Trump, 
chie?y due to her understand-
able disdain for restrictions 
on the Second Amendment. 
Ex-boxer Mike Tyson gave 
a resounding endorsement 
for Trump, a result of a long-
standing professional rela-
tionship between the two.
Finally, Hall of Fame 
forward Dennis Rodman 
tweeted out support for the 
Republican nominee. The 
endorsement is no surprise 
considering Rodman has 
been close with North Korean 
supreme leader Kim Jong-
Un, who voiced support for 
Trump after watching the ?rst 
Democratic primary debate, a 
troubling endorsement.
Tartan soccer teams wipe the ?oor with Case WesternThe Tartan fantasy football league is still alive and well
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team played 
their ?nal match of the 
regular season on Saturday 
against University Athletic 
Association (UAA) rival Case 
Western Reserve University. 
The Tartans were victorious 
by a score of 2–0, and they 
end the season with an over-
all record of 11–5–1, and 5–2 
in UAA play.
The game got off to a slow 
start, but the Tartans con-
trolled the pace of the game 
despite there being no score 
for the majority of the ?rst 
half. The Tartans continued 
to push into Spartan terri-
tory and apply considerable 
pressure until they ?nally 
broke through the opposing 
defense. In the 42nd minute, 
?rst-year forward Sydney 
Webber scored her ?rst goal 
of the season after junior mid-
?elder Morgan Kontor sent 
a pass from the sideline to 
Webber. Webber connected 
with the ball as it was in the 
air and made a quick shot that 
?ew past the Spartan goal-
keeper and into the back of 
the net, earning the Tartans 
their ?rst concrete lead of the 
game. This was the only suc-
cessful goal attempt out of the 
Tartans’ nine in the ?rst half, 
but the lack of accuracy didn’t 
matter as the Spartans didn’t 
attempt a single shot on goal 
in the ?rst half.
The Spartans did manage 
to ?nd two shot attempts in 
the second half, but senior 
goalkeeper Katie Liston shot 
both down. The Tartans con-
tinued to sti?e their opponent 
until they broke the game 
wide open in the 89th minute. 
The Tartan defense cleared 
the ball out of their territory 
and junior forward Sienna 
Stritter found the ball, taking 
a long shot over the head of 
the Spartan goalkeeper and 
securing the win for the Tar-
tans. Carnegie Mellon places 
second overall in the UAA 
standings with this win.
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team also faced 
off against Case Western 
Reserve later that day and 
found the same result as the 
women’s team, winning 2–0. 
The men’s team ends their 
season with an impressive re-
cord of 12–3–2 and 3–2–2 in 
the UAA.
This game for the Tartans 
was all about sophomore mid-
?elder Zack Masciopinto, who 
scored both goals on the night 
and completely took over the 
game with the help of his 
teammates. The Tartans start-
ed making plays as early as 
possible, and they made the 
best of their early aggression 
in the second minute when 
the Tartans scored for the ?rst 
time. Senior forward Devin 
Keane was credited with an 
assist as he launched a pass 
across the front of the goal to 
Masciopinto, who connected 
with the ball and headed a 
shot straight past the Spartan 
keeper.
The offense wasn’t the 
only thing dominating for the 
Tartans, though. Sophomore 
goalkeeper Alec Lam main-
tained the one score advan-
tage for the Tartans with two 
critical saves in the ?rst half, 
including a save on a free kick 
in the upper corner of the net. 
The scoreboard remained the 
same for quite some time, 
but the Tartans made anoth-
er push to score in the 67th 
minute. The play began with 
sophomore forward Anthony 
Gulli making a forward pass 
to Masciopinto deep inside 
enemy territory. A defender 
slid to stop his momentum, 
but Masciopinto hurdled the 
player and recovered the ball, 
immediately taking a shot 
that went right past the Spar-
tan goalkeeper. The game 
would end with the score of 
2–0, and now the Tartans wait 
to see if they will get a bid for 
the 2016 NCAA Division III 
Championship, set to begin 
on Friday, Nov. 11.
ABHISHEK TAYAL
Pillbox Editor
Seven weeks into the Tar-
tan Fantasy Football League, 
I was under the impression 
that I was ?nally getting the 
hang of the entire thing. I had 
a self-in?icted horrible week 
one, as at that point I was still 
wrapping my head around the 
complex minutiae of my ?rst 
fantasy sports league. Imag-
ine my surprise at learning 
that you’ve got to open an app 
and manually set your team! 
After a brief sit down with the 
Tartan’s Layout Manager and 
resident Expert-On-All-Things 
Zeke Rosenberg, I thought 
that I understood the basics 
of this fascinating form of 
competition.
Last week, disaster struck 
as I forgot to set my lineup 
Friday morning after a Thurs-
day night out on the town. 
The Donkeys ?nished with 43 
points, about a third of the 
previous week. I was a com-
bination of shocked and hor-
ri?ed. I trembled to consider 
how my league-mates must 
be laughing at me. It is thus 
with a humble heart and head 
bowed, I accept abject defeat 
in week eight of the Tartan 
Fantasy Football League. To 
further acknowledge this mo-
ment, I am renaming my team 
to the Loquacious Losers. 
Without further ado, here’s 
the recap:
Dreamland Warriors over 
Loquacious Losers 87–42
The freshly rechristened 
Losers earned their name with 
style in a humiliating 45 point 
loss to Assistant Sports Edi-
tor Ian Tanaya’s Dreamland 
Warriors this week. Alshon 
Jeffrey of the Chicago Bears, 
put up something of a ?ght 
for the Losers, bringing home 
16 of the team’s 42 points. 
That said, the Losers were no 
match for the Warriors in any 
other respect. Quarterback 
Drew Brees, running back 
Jacquizz Rodgers, and run-
ning back Latavius Murray 
were a quartet to be reckoned 
with, bringing in 61 points to-
gether. The Losers, still licking 
their wounds, will be eagerly 
awaiting their next encoun-
ter to give back in kind to the 
Warriors.
Mr. Rodgers’s Neighborhood 
over DeMarco DePolo 
135–104
This was one of the closer 
matchups of the season, and 
probably the closest matchup 
of the week. Operations Man-
ager Jade Crockem’s team Mr. 
Rodgers’s Neighborhood pre-
vailed over Layout Manager 
Zeke Rosenberg’s DeMarco 
DePolo after a long and hard 
match that could have gone 
either way. Both quarter-
backs played really well, with 
Crockem’s Aaron Rodgers edg-
ing out Rosenberg’s Matthew 
Ryan 33 to 23. Far from throw-
ing in the towel, DeMarco De-
Polo put on a valiant showing 
of their own right. Right back 
DeMarco Murray, wide re-
ceiver Jordy Nelson, and run-
ning back Melvin Gordon put 
up a spirited 19 points each. 
Mr. Rodgers Neighborhood 
was preternaturally consistent 
though, with nobody on the 
lineup making less than nine 
points as they carried “The 
Neighborhood” to victory once 
more, a familiar sight.
What is going on? over 
extremely dank team 118–65
Forum Editor Sinead 
Foley’s beautifully named 
What is going on? contin-
ued its hot streak for another 
straight week. Sports Editor 
Alex Wood’s extremely dank 
team got a thrashing compa-
rable to the Loquacious Losers 
at the hands of Foley’s hilari-
ously, deceptively, unassum-
ingly named team. Foley’s 
quarterback Blake Bortles was 
on ?re, bringing in 29 points 
all by himself. Nipping at his 
heels was Foley’s running back 
Jonathan Stewart with 22 
points, who in turn was closely 
followed by fellow running 
back David Johnson with 17 
points. Wood’s extremely dank 
team didn’t stand a chance. 
Wood’s Placekicker Stephen 
Gostkowski brought in the 
most points with a thoroughly 
average 13 points.
Masshole Knickerbockers 
over Plaidie Daddies 141–
107
Online Editor India Price’s 
Pladie Daddies put up a re-
spectable 107; that is until one 
takes a look at the competi-
tion. Former personnel man-
ager Lula Beresford’s Massh-
hole Knickerbockers scored 
a mind-numbing 141 points. 
The Knickerbockers’ quar-
terback, and the only player 
I knew about before I joined 
this league, Tom Brady, scored 
a very impressive 29 points. 
However, even this was over-
shadowed by Knickerbockers’s 
wide receiver Amari Cooper 
bringing in a stupendous 35 
points all by himself. Much to 
Price’s chagrin, her humilia-
tion would still not be com-
plete. The Knickerockers’s 
tight end Tyler Eifert brought 
in 25 points of his own. The 
Plaidie Daddies played a de-
cent game on a day that they 
had very little chance of win-
ning the fantasy game.
McManus’s Anus over How 
does this work? 126–109
Publisher Sarah Gutekunst’s 
team McManus’s Anus played 
a good game to beat Foley’s 
second team, How does this 
work?, 126 to 109. Gutekunst’s 
running back Matt Forte put up 
a very respectable 23 points. 
Her tight end Rob Gronkowski 
scored an impressive 21 points 
as well. Foley’s team played 
well too, with running back 
Devonte Freeman running up 
21 points That concludes our 
roundup for week eight. On-
ward to week nine!

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
about thirsty Tinder men
Dear Sarah,
Aren’t dating apps supposed to make dating 
easier? In my personal experience, things have only 
gotten more complicated. Tinder is my first attempt 
to meet guys without actually meeting them.
It’s nice to be able to keep someone at arm’s length 
before you let them in. They only know as much 
about you as you want them to, so you can slowly 
unravel your story as you feel comfortable. You 
can stretch the truth, make yourself seem more 
interesting, more popular, or more easygoing. You 
could only choose to put on photos from high 
school before you gained 15 pounds. This is such a 
delightful arrangement — until you realize anyone 
could be guilty of this.
Once in a handful of guys, I’m interested. He seems 
like the kind of guy I could maybe one day consider 
getting into bed with. But breaking that wall of 
meeting in person is so scary. I never know what I’ll 
find behind the curtain, behind the screen.
What if he has really long finger nails? What if 
he tries to tell me he thinks Lord of the Rings is 
overrated? What if he’s a catfish? What if he kidnaps 
me and sells me into human trafficking?! How do I 
decide if a guy is worth the risk it takes to meet up 
with a Tinder Guy? Is there a rubric?
Cautiously,
Tinder Has Incalculable Risks Surrounding The 
Youths
Dear THIRSTY.
Dating is such a mess, no matter what. And you’re 
right, Tinder can be even scarier and messier 
because you never know what you’re going to get.
To start with, it’s best practice to just be yourself. 
Don’t spill out your entire life story all at once, 
but be true to your personality and your history. 
In order to avoid any unfortunate surprises, ask 
questions. If you actually want to make a rubric, 
write down specific questions in order to check up 
on your unforgivables, like pop culture proclivities, 
drug or alcohol habits, political or religious beliefs, 
or blatant misogyny. You don’t have to feel bad 
being direct because he’s just a perfect stranger 
who you’ll probably never actually meet in real life. 
So what if he doesn’t like it? You don’t owe him 
anything. If he happens to pass the initial test and 
he’s still around, that’s a pretty good sign. The 
next evaluative criterion is time. How long can you 
hold a conversation for? How long does it take him 
to respond? Does he consistently message you 
past 11 p.m.? Does he want to meet up tonight, 
or does he ask you when you’re free? These 
questions can help you tell if he’s a skeevy perv 
who only wants you for your lady bits, or if he’s at 
least charming enough to trick you.
But as a foxy lady on Tinder, the world is truly 
yours. As long as you take appropriate safety 
measures, going on Tinder dates can be a fun 
weekend hobby. If he’s good enough to pass the 
initial tests, then he’s probably a decent enough 
guy. 
He’ll probably give you some say in where you go 
for the date. Pick somewhere you like! Preferably 
a very public place where someone would notice 
if something happened to you! He’ll also probably 
offer to pay because that’s what he thinks a 
gentleman should do, and he’s damn right. 
So maybe he’s boring and can’t make 
conversation, at least you’ve got Fuku Tea. 
One more safety tip: go in with an exit 
strategy. Before you leave, plan with one of 
your friends a code word that you can text 
them to signal that they should call with a fake 
emergency. 
Protect yourself. Oh baby, it’s a wild world!
Sarah
Katy Dyer | Junior StaffwriterV for Vendetta
subterfuge, plotting, and vile villain-ery!
“Remember, remember! The fifth of 
November,” won’t mean much to the majority 
of readers. Some of you might be thinking right 
now, “Remember what? That the 112 homework 
was due?” However, random as the date 
may seem, it forms one of the fundamental 
pillars of the movie V for Vendetta, a fast-
paced dystopian flash-forward into neo-fascist 
London. Essentially, the movie portrays life 
in the UK in the wake of a devastating world 
war and various forms of internal strife, 
including pandemics and national biohazard 
emergencies. The Nazi-esque Norsefire Party, 
promising political stability and a panacea for 
the populace’s all-consuming fear, took over 
and consolidated their power by transitioning 
quickly to fascist regime. The movie begins by 
introducing the audience to their protagonist: 
Evey, portrayed by a young Natalie Portman. 
Evey is a government employee by day at the 
British Television Network, which functions 
as a propaganda puppet of the state. Evey, 
while out past curfew on the eve of Nov. 5, is 
brought together through a serendipitous chain 
of events with the charismatic and mysterious 
“V.” V not only wears a Guy Fawkes mask 
and sports a billowing black cape that may 
give viewers flashbacks to a certain potions 
master, but it soon becomes apparent that 
he carries an intimidating array of knives. 
He’s dangerous, witty, and passionate, all 
qualities that prompt Evey to accompany him 
to a downtown rooftop overlooking the Old 
Bailey for what V promises will be the “best 
orchestra” she’s ever heard. In the wake of 
the explosion, Evey knows little except that V 
is responsible, but soon she gets drawn into 
his web of subterfuge, plotting, and revenge. 
However, soon parallels between Evey’s and 
V’s pasts begin to arise, bringing with them 
more questions than answers. How and why 
does V select his targets? Can Evey morally 
condone his methods? How far is Evey willing 
to go to avenge the people in her life who’ve 
been ripped away by the Norsefire regime? As 
Evey finds herself pulled deeper and deeper 
into V’s world, she must both confront the 
painful events of her past and uncover the 
inner strength hidden in her personality. As 
both attempt to evade government detection 
while inciting rebellion amongst London’s 
masses, some members of the government 
begin to question the “official” history books 
as well. Admittedly, this movie can feel a 
tad overwrought sometimes, as the absolute 
division of all people and organizations into 
“good” and “bad” often lacks nuance, and 
leaves some characters as one-dimensional at 
best. However, despite this cheese-factor, The 
Wachowski Brother’s V for Vendetta ultimately 
stands as an inspiring testament to the 
power of one person to spark change. As we 
nervously skid towards this election season’s 
conclusion, crossing our fingers and biting 
our nails, this movie serves as an important 
reminder that we all must take responsibility 
and stand up together for what we believe in. 
The very best way to do that, voting, may not 
make for quite such engaging cinematic fare as 
cloaked nighttime capers through the streets of 
London, but it’s equally important. Remember, 
remember! … The eighth of November.

Adventure, learning experiences and embracing the uncomfortable.

After a long week of studying and taking midterms, a break is much need-
ed. Whether it’s with a couple of friends, or by yourself, taking the time 
to relax and have fun is important. Of the many possible ways you can 
spend your breaks, my personal favorite is going out to eat. Not only can 
you get a break from studying on campus, but also from campus food. 
Plus, this gives you an opportunity to explore more of the areas around 
Pittsburgh.
So I haven’t been here long enough to locate very many great food plac-
es, but the other day I was able find one! A few of my friends and I decid-
ed to try Sichuan Gourmet in Squirrel Hill for the first time. We got there 
at around six, and the place was pretty crowded with college students and 
families. The environment was very active with students playing cards at 
their tables or families chatting with one another, while waiters were run-
ning around taking orders or carrying dishes. My friends and I were seat-
ed quickly (we luckily arrived somewhat early). As usual, the waiter took 
our orders for drinks and left us to decide on our dishes. The menu had 
so many options to choose from, and it was able to accommodate people 
with a variety of tastes and diets. There was even a “Pittsburgh Flavors” 
section, which had the typical Chinese takeout dishes.
When it came to deciding on what dishes my friends and I wanted to eat, 
our orders covered a wide range of flavors. My one friend, who’s a vege-
tarian, ordered the Mapo tofu (without meat), which consists of diced tofu 
cooked in a sauce made from spicy chili and beans. My two other friends 
ordered an appetizer of steamed vegetable dumplings, and the Home 
Style Beef Noodle Soup, which just has noodles and pieces of beef in a 
spicy beef broth. I ordered the braised beef tendon, which (as it sounds) 
has beef tendon covered in a sauce mixed with vegetables and slices of 
ham. All the non-soup dishes came with a cup of white rice.
After ordering, the first dish to arrive at our table was the dumpling appe-
tizer. It had five dumplings on the plate with a dish of what looked like 
soy sauce. Everyone at the table agreed that the dumplings were very 
good, especially with the sauce which had a light salty taste. The vegeta-
ble filling was cooked just right, and the wonton was perfectly steamed. 
The only thing was that we wished we’d ordered another serving, because 
five dumplings was just not enough for us. After finishing our appetizer, 
it took maybe another forty minutes (fifty for my dish) for our food to 
arrive. That was a little annoying, especially since all of us were hungry. 
But when the food finally arrived, they arrived in large portions. All the 
meals were nicely presented in large glass bowls. For the non-soup dishes 
we were given serving spoons, and we ate using our appetizer plates and 
chopsticks.
Overall, I found the food to be very unique. Each meal had a spicy taste 
to it, which was not overbearing, but just right. My friends and I all tried 
each other’s meals and my favorite had to be the Mapo tofu. I had never 
tasted anything like it before, and the chili sauce gave it such an inter-
esting spicy flavor that easily balanced out with the white rice. The other 
meals I thought tasted fine, but my friends who ordered the soup found 
nothing particularly special about it. My beef tendon dish was great — the 
sauce was a little salty-sweet, the tendon was chewy, and the vegetables 
were cooked just right. Eating the meal reminded me of the Filipino dishes 
my family cooked back home. I was actually surprised to find it on the 
menu, since I haven’t encountered too many restaurants that actually serve 
beef tendon.
If you like exposing yourself to different foods and flavors, definitely order 
something from Sichuan Gourmet. There are enough options for you to 
find something that you may like. Although I would have to say there is 
nothing really special about the restaurant environment itself, and the food 
does take awhile to arrive at your table (depending on what you order), 
it’s still a great place to catch up with friends and get away from campus.

Richard Pell’s works, fueled by curiosity, exist within the intersection of being a 
maker, storyteller, documentarian, curator, and scientist. The Myth of the Great 
Outright Extraordinary!, Pell’s Artist of the Year solo show at the Pittsburgh 
Center for the arts, engages within the expected roles at art, science, and his-
tory museums. The difference, aside from content, in expected roles is the way 
they inform; a successful art show leaves audiences with more questions than 
answers, more aware of their knowledge and experience gaps, while audi-
ences leave a history or science museums with increased knowledge. Pell, a 
Carnegie Mellon professor of art, presents these found objects and stories in a 
way that occupies both spaces.
If there is a heart to this exhibition it is Pell’s Cabinet of Ambiguities. A quite 
literal tether between Pell and his viewer; an old-fashioned telephone activates 
the space. Simultaneously, one of the ten objects compartmentalized within 
a small glass display case is illuminated when an audience member puts the 
phone to their ear, and listens to Pell’s story about the object inside. Pell talks 
about how he came in contact with each of these objects, the history behind 
them, and either hints to or informs its ambiguity. The sincerity Pell conveys 
through this experience puts the integrity of the show’s title, The Myth of the 
Great Outright Extraordinary! into question. Is this title simply hyperbolic? Or 
can the objects truly be great and outright extraordinary if the viewer chooses 
to become invested in their narrative? And does this really even matter?
Objects in Pell’s Cabinet of Ambiguities include a tiny framed cursive copy of 
the Lord’s Prayer, gracefully written by Martha Honeywell who created the 
piece by holding a pen in her mouth since she did not have arms. The sense 
of awe from this work comes from the process of its creation and the success 
Honeywell had despite her disability and the sexism she surely faced as a 
female artist living from 1787 to 1848. Other objects, like the FBI blacked out 
page in Robert Lansberry’s dense surveillance file derives its sense of awe from 
the absurdity of its existence and aura of mystery.
Ambiguity within these objects ranges, leading viewers to wonder about 
gaping narrative holes: what conditions brought this young girl to severe illness 
loops through their mind as they stare at the record inscribed with a dedica-
tion from a loving father as a song made by family and friends plays through 
the telephone. Objects from Pell’s family collection, like the metal milk carton 
holder invented by his great grandfather, sense of ambiguity is simple, and 
overlooked. As technology and design constantly evolve, why is it that the stan-
dard shape of a milk carton has remained the same for over 50 years? In Pell’s 
words, “The stories that an object can tell accumulate and change over time as 
the world around them changes. Some get better with age. Sometimes you lose 
the thread.” I wonder if the milk carton will maintain its shape 50 or 100 years 
from now, and imagine how this unseen history will change the way we value 
the metal milk carton carrier.
The experience of looking through glass-paned cabinets reinforces a science-like 
objectivity mirrored in the permissive way Pell curiously watches the meaning 
and understanding of these objects change with time. As the viewers learn of 
stories about government secret surveillance, brainwashing, and experimenta-
tion that conflict with the America painted in history books, the news, and press 
events they attempt to understand in a state of conflict and ambiguity. Pell’s 30 
minute documentary on long time Pittsburgh street protester, Robert Lansberry, 
“Don’t Call Me Crazy on the Fourth of July” examines the evidence supporting 
Lansberry’s claim that the government was censoring his mail access. Shedding 
light onto this untold history, audiences leave questioning what the government 
might currently be concealing. Perhaps this is Pell’s greatest success; the audience 
leaves more aware, intrigued, and uncertain.
Rich Pell is a founding member of the highly acclaimed art and engineering col-
lective, the Institute for Applied Autonomy. To see more of his work, check out 
his small museum, The Center for PostNatural History filled with creatures at the 
intersection of culture, nature, and biotechnology.

It was October 2012, and with the steadfast approach of my first 
Halloween in New Delhi I frantically searched the internet for 
some stupid costume ideas. After surfing for a good twenty min-
utes, a video titled “FUNNY HALLOWEEN COSTUME IDEAS” 
caught my attention. With a click, a blue-eyed Australian boy 
was staring back at me, and so started my encounter with “So 
yesterday I got a haircut, and managed to get the perfect quiff.”
Friday night, just over four years later, the blue-eyed boy capti-
vated a room full of crying, screaming, and enchanted fans of 
all ages, sexes, and sexual orientations at Stage AE. “Thank you 
all for coming,” he smiled after opening with the chart-topper, 
“Wild,” “you have no idea how much this means to me.”
Troye Sivan started out as a child star, starring in the 2009 
South African film Spud, based off of the novel of the same 
name. The movie went on to become a part of a trilogy, with 
Sivan keeping his role. Fans were also able to see Troye as the 
young version of Logan in X-Men Origins: Wolverine in 2009.
With the weight of his entertainment background hanging on his 
shoulders, Sivan took to YouTube to better introduce himself to 
the world. Week after week we saw videos ranging from song 
covers to quirky vlogs, and the YouTuber skyrocketed to become 
one of the most popular people on the internet.
In December 2012, Troye sang a comical original song titled 
“We’re my OTP”, with OTP of course meaning “one true pair.” 
Staying true to his YouTuber persona, this song delved into the 
themes of internet culture and made heads nod in agreement 
around the world.
In May 2013, Troye released a video of his original song “The 
Fault in our Stars” inspired by the heartbreaking novel by John 
Green. This is where I personally saw an edge of heaviness 
creeping onto Troye’s channel. Something was changing.
In August 2013, Troye releases “Coming Out.” The incredibly 
candid video fulfilled what its title suggested. Sivan, on a ped-
estal of internet fame, poured his heart out to his fans about his 
sexual orientation, and went on to release a second part to the 
video. Through his video he addressed everything from talking 
to parents, and finding support through the resources and com-
munity that exist out there. Hearts melted, and if anything his fan 
base grew.

The Originals
In July 2014, Troye released Happy Little Pill. The dark record 
explored themes of addiction, emptiness, and escape, placing 
Sivan’s music into the genre of “dream pop.”
In August 2014, the EP TRXYE is released, which features three 
songs in addition to “The Fault in our Stars” and “Happy Little 
Pill.”
When Troye released his EP, as someone who knew him for his 
comedic antics more than his musical inclination, I was critical. 
I found myself going back, and listening to his covers both from 
his very early YouTube uploads to around the time where I had 
started following his videos. He was good, no doubt, but I was 
hesitant in seeing where this was going.
In July 2015, Troye posts a video titled “Announcing My Album” 
and starts by thanking his fans for their incredible love for his 
EP, that eventually sent it to the top of 66 charts all around the 
world. He gushes about the work he’s put into “doing it again, 
and doing it better,” and announces that “this is happening.”
In December 2015, Blue Neighbourhood, Sivan’s first studio 
album, was released, after Wild, Talk Me Down, and Youth had 
teased fans for the months building up to the release.
In May 2016, it was announced that on his world tour, Troye 
would be coming to Pittsburgh. I got up from my family gather-
ing, ran to my room, grabbed my laptop, and frantically looked 
for presale tickets. And that was that. I was going to see him.
The scene was surreal. Rainbow flags, sparkles on cheeks and 
bodies swaying in unison. Troye’s face went serious as he sang 
with heart, and softened to the goofy smile that I so clearly 
remember seeing for the first time all those years ago. He had 
everyone sing happy birthday to a fan, and brought a group of 
devout fans onstage to take a selfie with him.
As fans pelted gifts onstage he announced, “I usually don’t like 
when people throw things on stage, but I also like free stuff, 
so thank you, you guys!” As everyone screamed in unison, he 
picked up a pair of broken sunglasses and put them on, and 
proceeded to inspect what he called a “nice t-shirt” that some-
one had thrown for him.
Concerts are always cathartic. Aside from seeing a being that 
you only know from behind a screen, in person, the sheer 
atmosphere of people singing together and base vibrating in 
your bones, it’s enough to rock your emotional capacity. Friday 
night, however, I didn’t feel like I was going to see a star. I felt 
I was seeing a friend after a long time. Someone who grew up 
with me, and found themselves in their own twisted way while I 
found mine. I found myself looking for his humanizing moments 
more than his larger-than-life presence, and was relieved and 
delighted to see it again and again throughout the night, from 
when he took off his platform sneakers because they hurt his 
feet, to when he called out to his fellow LGBTQ community mem-
bers, with a lump in his throat.
Thank you Troye, I hope we get to see each other again soon.

Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, is celebrated every autumn. It symbolizes the 
victory of light over darkness, knowledge over ignorance, and hope over despair. 
Every year, people in South Asia and all over the world celebrate Diwali by lighting 
diyas, lanterns, and firecrackers, cleaning, and decorating their homes with colorful 
and elaborate powders and flower petals. They also share the most sumptuous and 
delicious Indian food, and dance the night away in traditional Indian Garba style.
At Carnegie Mellon, Diwali is celebrated every year during an event put together 
by OM, CMU’s student organization for Indian spirituality and culture. This year’s 
celebration, in Wiegand Gymnasium, featured a massive buffet of Indian food, 
Bollywood music, and Garba dancing aplenty, along with performances including 
CMU Sahara, CMU Raasta, and Deewane.

Ban All Blockbusters
explaining the 13th
Eric Wiegand | Junior Staffwriter
Art by Paola Mathus | Staff Artist
Watch 13th tonight, get some sleep, and wake up 
tomorrow ready to act.
This is a new documentary from Ava DuVernay, 
the director of Selma (2014), currently available to 
stream on Netflix.
13th examines racial inequality in the United States 
by focusing on the issue of mass incarceration 
stemming from the Thirteenth Amendment to the 
Constitution. The film aims to put on stark display the 
patterns of oppression which black Americans have 
experienced, from disproportionate imprisonment, to 
Jim Crow, to broad racial profiling. Rest assured 
that DuVernay knows exactly what she is 
doing, combining the incredible heart seen 
in Selma with the prowess of a director 
having several documentaries under her 
belt already. She executes her purpose 
with laser precision.
I watched 13th with my roommate 
Christian Strange, a fellow third 
year School of Drama student. 
He is a black man from South 
Carolina.
Strange is a clear-eyed, 
intelligent man, with a keen 
desire to improve the world 
around him and share his story. 
I was excited to experience this 
documentary with him and to 
explore how our feelings related 
afterward.
Here is a selection of our thoughts:
Christian Strange: This being my second 
time watching ... I started to think about 
how many people have sacrificed their lives 
and laid their lives down so I could live in a sort 
of privileged lifestyle. Because, when I watched this, 
you know, I examined my own life and I kind of 
said to myself, “I would never get arrested, I would 
never get patted down for something, because of 
the way that I was brought up, because of the way I 
carry myself,” and that hurts because I feel like I am 
privileged in a sense. Whereas there are some guys 
who get looked at all the time.
Eric Wiegand: At the beginning of the documentary, 
they focus a lot on D.W. Griffith’s Birth of a Nation, 
and I thought that was really illuminating, how much 
of an impact it had on the country. It began the 
second arrival of the Ku Klux Klan in America, and 
it’s a film. The documentary kept going with that 
as far as talking about black representation in the 
media, and I thought that was signifying of Ava’s 
mission as a filmmaker herself. It hits at the heart of 
her work and her mission.
CS: As an artist myself, it’s my mission to create 
pieces of work that showcase who I am as an 
African-American male and the experiences I’ve 
gone through. And watching this movie …like Fred 
Hampton, the young guy, twenty-one years old, our 
age, who got killed, because he was trying to unite 
people together, by the police. I look at his story 
and all the stories they talk about and I say, “I’m 
going to use this in my own life, and pick up from 
where they left off.”
EW: Something that is extremely prevalent in the 
documentary is the question of how we define “us.” 
They were talking about politicians fighting to be 
the savior of the white population. I think that’s a 
huge issue. There’s a feeling in a large part of the 
population that “us” does not mean everyone in the 
United States.
CS: I feel like my grandfather and my father can 
speak firsthand on how these white politicians 
try to implement new ideas to help the general 
population, but it’s only helping their people. My 
grandfather works with low-income housing, he 
helps to get these Black and Hispanic families into 
decent housing, and he is the only person who will 
constantly be on their side. I know that I would 
love to have children one day, but I get scared of 
the fact that I will have to tell my children how 
to present themselves in a manner that doesn’t 
make them seem threatening, because I know 
my father did it with me. I never want to 
have that talk with my son, but I know that 
it will happen.
EW: Just watching a documentary that 
punches me in the gut is a reminder 
of the impact that this sort of thing 
can have, that art can have, and it 
really is an enormous inspiration to 
go forward and create content that 
is addressing these issues, forcing 
people’s eyes upon them like this 
film is.
CS: I also want to speak on the 
images in the credits, because it gets 
me every time, seeing these young 
faces, these young Black faces, and 
seeing the joy that they have. But I can 
also see them not realizing the struggles 
they have ahead of them. Seeing these 
black families, in good times, you know. 
It’s good to show not only the bad sides, but 
also the good sides, the happy sides of African-
American life.
Ava DuVernay’s documentary urges us to listen. 
It insists that we not turn our gaze away, as is so 
easy for some of us to do. It was a galvanizing 
experience, sharing the film with Christian. I urge 
you to watch 13th, share it, discuss it. Our only 
course toward a better future is through dialogue, 
the sharing of experience. This film is one step.
