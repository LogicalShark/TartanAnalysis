A Carnegie Mellon gradu-
ate student and alumnus 
were found dead in Sherwood 
Towers Apartments on North 
Craig Street in an apparent 
murder-suicide last Thursday.
Chalalai Chaihirunkarn, 
26, a third-year Ph.D. student 
in the Computation, Organi-
zations, and Society program 
within the School of Comput-
er Science (SCS), and alum-
nus Bryan Springer (CIT ‘07), 
29, were found in their apart-
ment after the building’s man-
agement asked police to check 
on the apartment’s occupants.
Chaihirunkarn was shot 
multiple times in the head 
and chest after Springer pur-
chased a gun and ammunition 
from Iron City Armory in Brid-
geville on Tuesday, the Associ-
ated Press reported. Springer 
was an information technol-
ogy support associate at the 
Software Engineering Insti-
tute, according to an email to 
the campus from Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno.
“We are reaching out to 
family members and friends 
to offer any assistance we can 
provide in this time of loss,” 
Casalegno wrote in the email.
Chaihirunkarn was attend-
ing Carnegie Mellon with a 
fellowship from the govern-
ment of Thailand, Director of 
the Institute for Software Re-
search (ISR) William Scherlis 
wrote in an email to members 
of the institute. She was be-
ing advised by ISR professor 
James Herbsleb and was also 
a graduate of SCS’s MSIT in 
eBusiness Technology pro-
gram, according to Scherlis. 
Springer had family in Thai-
land as well.
“Chalalai’s colleagues talk 
both about her talent and ca-
pability as a researcher and 
also about her as a kind and 
thoughtful friend,” Scherlis 
wrote in the email.
In regards to Springer, 
Director and Chief Execu-
tive Of?cer of the Software 
Engineering Institute Paul 
Nielsen wrote to members of 
the institute, “I know I speak 
for the entire Executive Lead-
ership Team when I say our 
hearts are with those who are 
grieving the loss of one of our 
SEI family.”
Dean of the School of Com-
puter Science Andrew Moore 
wrote in an email to the 
School of Computer Science, 
“I am shocked and grieved 
and my personal thoughts are 
with the families. I am sure we 
all feel the same way.”

Winter Storm Juno results in less snowfall than expected
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
The Northeastern U.S. 
bundled up in anticipation of 
Winter Storm Juno early last 
week. Pittsburgh was ?rmly 
within the designated disaster 
zone and prepared accord-
ingly, canceling more than 
three dozen ?ights out of Pitts-
burgh International Airport, 
among other moves to com-
bat the Steel City’s impending 
weather.
The predictions didn’t pan 
out. The fear that the whole 
Northeast was moments from 
becoming a tableau in The Day 
After Tomorrow turned out to 
be based on a forecast error by 
the National Weather Service 
(NWS).
The storm hit slightly fur-
ther north and to the east than 
initially expected. The storm 
turned out to be problematic 
for places like Connecticut, 
Massachusetts, and Rhode 
Island, which did receive re-
cord snowfall of over two feet, 
interrupting many citizens’ 
daily activities.
This saved Pittsburgh from 
the brunt of the storm. The of-
?cial tally, according to The 
Weather Channel, turned 
out to be 4.3 inches 
of snow, still a heavy 
snowfall considering 
Pittsburgh’s usual 
January totals. On 
average, only 0.8 
days in January per 
year receive three inches of 
snowfall, and 0.2 receive ?ve 
inches, according to current-
results.com.
Using the site’s provided 
data, there would be approxi-
mately 0.33 days receiving 
the level of snowfall Pitts-
burgh got, meaning this kind 
of storm only happens 
once every 
three years. That level of im-
pact is not something to just 
brush off, but it does not com-
pare to the estimates of be-
tween one and two feet, with 
rates predicted to reach two 
feet of snow per hour.
Given the forecasts, stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon 
were unimpressed by the 
storm.
“I thought school 
would be can-
celed,” said 
sophomore physics major 
Anthony Paone. “But then it 
barely snowed at all.”
The contrast between ex-
pectation and reality was 
echoed by much of the student 
body with common terms like 
“underwhelming” and “anti-
climactic.”
The contrast between the 
predictions and reality led to 
some anger with local politi-
cians and the NWS.
New York City Mayor Bill 
de Blasio said that the city 
may experience a “potentially 
historic blizzard,” which some 
saw as an overreaction to the 
models given the reality of 
the storm in New York, which 
saw less than a foot 
despite predic-
tions nearing 
three feet. 
The 
mayor received backlash for 
his decision to shut the city 
down, but defended the deci-
sion to The Weather Channel 
saying, “We heard from mete-
orologists all over the region, 
that this was going to be two 
feet or more of snow. If that 
had proven to be true ... it was 
a no-brainer this was the right 
thing to do.”
Additionally, the NWS 
claimed that their prediction 
was largely correct in predict-
ing the shape and intensity of 
the storm, but their projec-
tions were about 50 to 100 
miles off.
While the snow was unusu-
ally intense, it did not reach 
the heights initially predicted. 
Pittsburgh residents were able 
to go about their daily activi-
ties without severe disrup-
tions, except for ?ights into 
and out of the 
city.
Purnell painting defaced
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
Last week, students in 
the School of Drama no-
ticed something different 
about the lobby of the Pur-
nell Center for the Arts: The 
large painting that hangs 
over the lobby’s lower stair-
well was marked with a set 
of initials in the lower right-
hand corner.
This isn’t the ?rst time 
the painting has been 
marked. According to Jona-
than Ward, the properties 
master of the School of Dra-
ma, the painting was ?rst 
defaced about a year ago, 
when someone wrote the 
initials “FTC” in the lower 
left-hand corner in what 
looks like white crayon or 
oil pastel. The most recent 
initials, “TSU,” appeared 
just last week.
Although the prove-
nance of the large painting 
is murky, Ward thinks that 
it was given as a gift to the 
School of Drama when the 
school was founded in 1914. 
The portrait was painted by 
Louis Kronberg, a Boston 
native who has other works 
hanging in the Philadelphia 
Academy Charter School 
and New York’s Metropoli-
tan Museum of Art. The 
subject of the painting is 
Richard Mans?eld, a Eu-
ropean actor, in his role of 
Cyrano de Bergerac in the 
eponymous play, which he 
performed on Broadway in 
1898 and 1899.
Ward estimated that 
Kronberg painted the por-
trait around the turn of the 
19th century. Ward found 
the painting in the School 
of Drama’s storage ware-
house about four years ago, 
and learned that it used to 
be on display in the Dean’s 
Of?ce of the School of Dra-
ma. Ward decided to bring 
the portrait back to life in 
Town Hall discusses wellness,minorities
BRADEN KELNER
Contributing Editor
Making the Carnegie 
Mellon experience last a 
lifetime, balancing work 
and wellness, and better 
representing minorities on 
campus were just some of 
the items up for discussion 
at Wednesday’s campus-
wide strategic planning 
town hall meeting.
The university’s second 
town hall this academic 
year drew in an array of 
campus members, includ-
ing undergraduates, gradu-
ates, exchange students, 
staff, faculty, and admin-
istrators, leaving many to 
stand on the edges of the 
packed Posner Center con-
ference room.
Richard Scheines, dean 
of the Dietrich College of 
Humanities and Social Sci-
ences, spoke ?rst about 
the ways in which Carn-
egie Mellon can enhance 
its learning experience, one 
of the main focus areas for 
those charged with creating 
the university’s new strate-
gic plan.
Among a number of 
points listed in the slide-
show, Scheines focused on 
the ideas of forming “mean-
ingful interdisciplinary 
experiences” and creating 
“the degree with long tails.” 
He ?rst proposed that stu-
dents from different majors 
study topics such as sustain-
able energy, immigration, 
or privacy to show how dif-
fering viewpoints bring dif-
ferent ideas. He then pro-
posed that students have 
opportunities for research 
later on in their undergrad-
uate careers.
Scheines also proposed 
that the university better 
merge creative disciplines 
like art and music with 
more academic majors like

Campus Crime & Incident Reports
A new study published by 
Carnegie Mellon professors 
found that people are often 
in?uenced by others when 
deciding what, and how 
much, they disclose online.
The study, published in 
Science by Carnegie Mellon 
professors Alessandro Ac-
quisti, Laura Brandimarte, 
and George Loewenstein 
examines the key privacy is-
sues facing people and their 
behaviors in the modern age, 
and makes recommendations 
for policy responses.
The study pinpointed 
three ?ndings regarding 
people’s perceptions and ac-
tions with respect to privacy 
issues: often being uncertain 
about the consequences of 
their privacy-related choices, 
the level of concern about 
privacy being context-de-
pendent, and in?uences by 
companies and government 
which can make people’s pri-
vacy concerns malleable.
For example, people do 
not understand the conse-
quences of sharing a fam-
ily milestone or are not sure 
about their own privacy pref-
erences, according to the re-
lease. 
In terms of malleability, 
the study cited, among oth-
er examples, the idea that 
people let other forces, like 
website administrators, make 
choices about their privacy, 
making their concerns ?ex-
ible dependent upon who 
suggests the privacy settings 
to them.
The authors concluded 
that policy approaches which 
focus exclusively on inform-
ing individuals of the pri-
vacy risks faced when using 
technology are not adequate, 
and should instead focus on 
attaining a better balance 
of power among individual 
people, governments, and 
companies using their digital 
data.

CMU partners to create Humanities Festival
Carnegie Mellon has an-
nounced that it is partnering 
with the Pittsburgh Cultural 
Trust to launch the ?rst Pitts-
burgh Humanities Festival.
Scheduled for March 
26–29, the Humanities Fes-
tival will focus on the theme 
“Smart Talk About Stuff 
That Matters” and will be 
hosted in various locations 
throughout Pittsburgh’s Cul-
tural District and surround-
ing neighborhoods.
“The festival will dem-
onstrate the humanities — 
broadly de?ned as knowl-
edge of humankind and its 
works — are stimulating, 
entertaining and vital to the 
life of the community,” said 
professor of English and Di-
rector of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Humanities Center David 
Shumway in a university 
press release.
Carnegie Mellon and the 
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust 
provided details of a vision 
for the Humanities Festival 
in a roundtable on Jan. 28. 
Tickets for the Pittsburgh 
Humanities Festival will go 
on sale Feb. 16.
Financial allocation: CMU International Film Festival
STUDENT SENATE MEETING MINUTES
Senate discussed a re-
quest to allocate $4,000 to 
the Carnegie Mellon Inter-
national Film Festival, an 
organization that brings 
?lmmakers and directors to 
campus. The $4,000 would 
mainly be used to bring an 
Oscar-nominated ?lmmaker 
to the festival. 
Last year, 4,000 people at-
tended the festival, of which 
40 percent are estimated to 
be students. 
Tickets to the festival will 
be $5 per ?lm for Carnegie 
Mellon-af?liated attendees 
and $10 for the general pub-
lic, with packages available 
at a discounted price. Sen-
ate voted to approve the 
allocation.

lobby, and even uses it as part 
of his stagecraft props class — 
he teaches students to repair 
the chips and fractures in the 
painting’s elaborate gilded 
frame.
“It’s a really cool and im-
pressive piece of artwork, and 
it ?ts our lobby really well,” 
Ward said. “It’s been moved a 
lot, it’s been stored a lot, and 
there’s been some deteriora-
tion, but it’s still kind of neat 
to see a relic like that, to have 
it in our lobby.”
When Ward saw the most 
recent graf?ti tag on the paint-
ing, he contacted University 
Police, as well as University 
Archives, which informed him 
that the painting is not part 
of Carnegie Mellon’s artistic 
property collection, and be-
longs to the School of Drama 
alone.
According to University 
Police, the investigation of 
this incident is ongoing.
“We’re interviewing peo-
ple and we don’t have any 
strong leads at this point,” 
Lieutenant Gary Scheimer 
said. “But we’re still hopeful, 
and we’re going to ?nd out 
who did this and why.”
The Carnegie Mellon Po-
lice Department is working 
with the Pittsburgh Police 
Department, which has a 
dedicated graf?ti task force, 
and the Port Authority Police, 
which also has an extensive 
graf?ti investigative depart-
ment. Ward noted that he had 
seen the tag “TSU” in other 
places around Pittsburgh.
Students and faculty alike 
are dismayed and shocked 
that someone would deface 
the 100-year-old work of art. 
“It makes me really sad and 
upset that someone would 
vandalize something so beau-
tiful,” Ward said.
“I think it’s old; I think it’s 
expensive.” said sophomore 
musical theatre major Lea 
Dimarchi. “I think we all kind 
of agree it’s disrespectful, and 
we don’t really know who did 
it.”
Ward said that the next 
step is to restore the painting. 
Although Ward lacks the ex-
perience to restore the paint-
ing himself, he has contacted 
the Carnegie Museum of Art’s 
restoration department and 
hopes to restore the painting 
with their help.
Ward stressed that the 
painting still hangs in the Pur-
nell lobby. “I’m not covering 
[it] up. I’m not making a point 
to hide it. Because the general 
response has been very simi-
lar to my own, from anybody 
I’ve talked to: That this is just 
disgraceful, it’s just wrong, 
and nothing this beautiful de-
serves to be treated like this.”

business and politics.
Focusing on the concept 
of creating a degree that lasts 
longer than four years, In-
terim Provost Nathan Urban 
proposed that the university 
provide opportunities for high 
school students and gradu-
ates to continue learning from 
Carnegie Mellon through ini-
tiatives such as programs for 
high school students or tech-
nology-enhanced learning 
and access to additional pro-
grams for alumni. Urban de-
scribed the idea of alumni as a 
“subscription to a CMU degree 
for decades thereafter.”
Next, James Garrett, dean 
of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology (CIT), introduced 
Carnegie Bosch professor of 
marketing Peter Boatwright 
to discuss facets of “Transfor-
mative Research, Creativity, 
Innovation and Entrepreneur-
ship,” which was identi?ed as 
a focus area in early discus-
sions of the strategic plan.
Boatwright suggested that 
the university try to have 
broader societal impact, nur-
ture innovation, be known as 
a place where people go to 
learn about leading innova-
tion and entrepreneurship, 
and that the university broad-
en support for faculty and 
students. Gary Fedder, CIT’s 
associate dean for research, 
proposed campus members 
work with the private sector, 
have ?exible work spaces, 
have more entrepreneurs in 
residence, and connect to 
alumni, among other ideas, to 
achieve these goals.
Speaking about the cam-
pus experience, Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno 
and Vice Provost for Educa-
tion Amy Burkert asked those 
attending the town hall, “how 
can we maintain our excel-
lence in all domains while 
ensuring a commitment 
to wellness for all campus 
members?”
“One of the things — the 
challenge — is this sort of 
implicit notion ... that there’s 
somehow some con?ict be-
tween really working as hard 
as we want people to work 
and quality of life,” said Caro-
line Acker, head of the depart-
ment of history. “Whereas I 
think what we’re looking for 
is that level of hard work that 
is compatible with quality of 
life that does not have a lot of 
wasted energy.”
John Lehoczky, interim 
vice president, addressed the 
issue of diversity on campus, 
asking members how the uni-
versity can promote diversity 
in all three strategic planning 
focus areas, as well as recruit 
diverse members to the cam-
pus community. Lehoczky 
cited “low representation of 
minority groups and women 
in the student body, staff, and 
faculty” and in “the leader-
ship of the university at all 
levels” as one of the hurdles to 
achieving this diversity.
Last, K. Jimmy Hsia, vice 
provost for international pro-
grams and strategy asked 
attending members how 
Carnegie Mellon can present 
itself in a world where an in-
ternational presence is “not a 
luxury.” Among his questions, 
Hsia asked how the university 
can consistently be top in the 
world, address the world’s 
“most pressing problems,” 
and act quickly on interna-
tional opportunities.
The third campus-wide 
town hall for the strategic 
plan will occur in March, with 
a speci?c date and time to be 
determined. For a recording

Google[x] unveils contact lenses to track blood sugar
Research teams at 
Google[x] and Novartis AG 
have joined forces to deliver 
to the world a smart way to 
correct vision as well as moni-
tor blood sugar levels. Smart 
contact lenses, the latest in a 
series of technology products 
designed to correct bodily 
function, relay data on glu-
cose contained in tears via a 
tiny sensor and an equally tiny 
antenna.
 In a news release earlier 
this month, Google described 
the technology in the lenses as 
being “so small they look like 
bits of glitter” and the antenna 
as being “thinner than human 
hair.”
The executive teams at 
both Google and Novartis be-
lieve these lenses will support 
a broader trend to involve pa-
tients in managing their own 
health, and to lower costs for 
management of chronic dis-
eases.

Microsoft HoloLens merges technology and reality
Microsoft, on Jan. 21, re-
leased a video announcing its 
newest product: the HoloLens. 
Taking after the technology of 
Google Glass and the Oculus 
Rift, the HoloLens will blend 
the virtual and the real by 
superimposing an operating 
system onto the real world, 
enabling us to envision the 
world as we imagine and want 
it to be. 
That, according to the ex-
ecutive team at Microsoft, is 
only the beginning. The tech-
nology behind it is simple: The 
goggles will track your move-
ments, watch your gaze and 
transform what you see by 
blasting light at your eyes. The 
HoloLens has applications in-
volving virtual interaction. Be-
cause the device tracks where 
you are, you can use hand ges-
tures, which right now include 
only a midair click, by raising 
and lowering your ?nger to in-
teract with the 3-D images.

New medical robot  allows for better surgical methods
On Jan. 29, a surgical ro-
bot, ?tted with a total of nine 
arms of varying sizes, carried 
out its debut operation on a 
cancer patient, at the Royal 
Marsden Hospital in England. 
The Da Vinci XI, a robot 
considered to be a technologi-
cal breakthrough, has opened 
up the doors to various pos-
sible treatments. It is hand op-
erated by surgeons, enabling 
them to make tiny and precise 
incisions. The robot mimics, 
but minimizes the movements 
of the surgeon who controls 
it, enabling them to carry out 
complex surgeries with mini-
mal invasion. 
The recovery time of pa-
tients has been cut down by 
several months, with far less

New leads on a way to ?ght aging and disease
Scientists at the Stanford 
University School of Medi-
cine could have ?nally made 
progress toward reversing the 
process of aging. The scientists 
are gearing up to announce to 
the world the new method of 
quickly and ef?ciently increas-
ing the length of human telo-
meres, the protective caps on 
the ends of chromosomes that 
are mostly linked to aging and 
the advent of various diseases. 
The procedure involves the 
use of a modi?ed type of RNA 
that allows researchers to gen-
erate large numbers of cells, 
which can then be used for 
study or drug development. In 
the recent studies conducted, 
skin cells with lengthened 
DNA were able to divide up 
to 40 more times compared 
to untreated cells, giving the 
scientists a lead as to treating 
diseases linked to shortened 
telomeres, and also in slowing 
down aging.

SpaceX explains the bene?ts of reusable rockets
Late last week, SpaceX 
released an animation that 
demonstrates what it would 
look like if the giant Falcon 
Heavy Rocket (one of the most 
powerful operation rockets in 
the world by a factor of two) 
returned home safely, after 
carrying its payload beyond 
earth’s atmosphere.
 This strategy is part of 
SpaceX’s effort to make space 
exploration cheaper with re-
usable rockets. SpaceX’s CEO 
Elon Musk believes that reus-
ing parts from used rockets 
could potentially bring down 
the cost of production by a 
factor of one hundred, if only 
rockets were programmed to 
return to the earth after hav-
ing completed their mission. 
Though SpaceX’s launch trial 
earlier in January failed, the 
team has big hopes for the Fal-
con Heavy Rocket, the launch 
of which is scheduled later this 
year.

Google’s self-driving car begins street testing
In May 2014, Google prom-
ised the public a self-driving 
car with no steering wheels or 
pedals, and they announced 
earlier this year that the car 
prototype is now “fully func-
tional” and ready for testing 
on roads starting this Febru-
ary. The car will be tested ?rst 
on a closed track and then on 
public roads, with “temporary 
manual controls” in case of a 
malfunction. 
The advent of self-driving 
cars, long dreamed of by auto 
giants such as Audi, Mercedes-
Benz, and General Motors, has 
the potential of revolution-
izing the “regular journey” by 
eradicating the need of for-
ward facing seating, mirrors, 
and foot-operated controls.
Despite this ability, the pro-
totype still resembles a normal 
vehicle, and is about the size 
of a smart car.

Imagine a world where 
your every move is being mon-
itored. Your routine actions 
and personal thoughts be-
come the business of others, 
and are manipulated beyond 
your control. It almost sounds 
like a page taken from George 
Orwell’s novel, 1984, a chill-
ing story about a totalitarian 
society. As our world becomes 
increasingly reliant on digital 
technology, we, too, may soon 
?nd ourselves facing the reali-
ties of science ?ction, through 
a phenomenon known as the 
Internet of Things (IoT).
IoT refers to our seamless 
ability to connect to the Inter-
net through a wide range of 
computing devices. In turn, 
we become more vulnerable 
to security hacks that compro-
mise our individual privacy.
Despite such concerns, the 
IoT has made our lives more 
convenient. It is the reason 
why the United States, as 
well as several other coun-
tries, celebrate Data Privacy 
Day, an international holiday 
that strives to increase public 
awareness about data privacy 
and protection.
Last Wednesday, Carnegie 
Mellon shared in the celebra-
tion by hosting a number of 
privacy-related events. A

2015 was keynote speaker

PUGWASH COLUMNGoogle offers service as phone carrier

Google is a company that 
everybody knows, most pub-
licly for its search engine. 
However, it is also involved in 
many other areas. Recently, 
Google began leasing infra-
structure from Sprint and T-
Mobile and reselling internet 
services to consumers. This 
week Pugwash discussed the 
possible implications of this 
move.
First, it was noted that 
Google has an incentive for 
providing good connections. 
Because most of Google’s 
money is made from people 
viewing ads, it is to Google’s 
bene?t to have more people 
connected to the Internet. It 
was speculated that Google 
could even offer the Internet 
services for free or for a very 
low price, gambling that they 
would make enough off the 
increased traf?c to their web 
content. Through vertical in-
tegration, Google would be 
highly incentivized to provide 
good service.
The idea of a Google mo-
nopoly was also discussed. 
Worries that Google will cre-
ate a monopoly were quickly 
put to rest. Service providers 
already carve up regions so 
as to avoid competition, and 
Google isn’t even entering the 
market as a true competitor. 
When it leases the infrastruc-
ture, it usually is only doing 
so where the bandwidth is not 
already being used. Because 
Sprint and T-Mobile still own 
the physical infrastructure,

Individuals with autism found to have 
unique brain patterns
JOSH BROWN
Staffwriter
Autism Spectrum Disor-
der (ASD) has been a topic of 
extensive study for neurosci-
entists for years, but it seems 
that with every new study, 
the disorder as a whole be-
comes increasingly unclear. 
This obscurity stems largely 
from that fact that there is 
so much contradictory infor-
mation being discovered and 
published. One example of 
this involves brain synchroni-
zation, or connectivity. Some 
research has attributed ASD 
dysfunction to a lack of syn-
chronization among brain 
regions; other research has 
stated the exact opposite, 
that the brains of individuals 
affected by autism exhibit hy-
per synchronization.
Neuroscientists from 
Carnegie Mellon University 
and the Weizmann Institute 
of Science in Rehovot, Israel 
created a study which would 
adjudicate between these 
?ndings once and for all. The 
team included Marlene Beh-
rmann, professor of cogni-
tive neuroscience at Carnegie 
Mellon University and co-
director of the Center for the 
Neural Basis of Cognition; 
Avital Hahany, Ph.D. student 
of neurobiology from Weiz-
mann Institute; and Rafael 
Malach, professor of brain 
research from Weizmann 
Institute.
The researchers originally 
set out to examine the brain 
in its resting state. “There 
is an assumption that when 
you are not doing anything, 
i.e., when your brain is at 
rest, that the interactions 
between brain regions [are 
recapitulated],” Behrmann 
explained. This means that 
activity from the waking state 
is ‘played back’ when the 
brain is at rest. “We wished to 
see whether or not the altera-
tions seen during daytime ac-
tivities could also be seen in 
the resting state.”
The research soon evolved 
into a large-scale exploration 
of connectivity, or the syn-
chronicity of activity between 
individual brain regions. 
The study’s evolution was 
triggered by the release of 
1,000 fMRI brain scans, half 
of which were part of control 
groups, the other half con-
sisting of ASD individuals. 
Before this landmark release, 
it was dif?cult for scientists to 
acquire large enough samples 
to do in-depth studies with 
widely generalizable results 
— hence the differing ?nd-
ings produced by previous 
studies.
Thanks to the combined 
efforts of twenty organiza-
tions, including Carnegie 
Mellon University, a public 
database was created. With 
access to this large, high-
quality database, Behrmann 
and her team were able to 
create a study which would 
?nally shed some light on 
the true nature of brain con-
nectivity in individuals with 
ASD.
The study incorporated 
a sample of 68 control and 
71 ASD brain scans. Data 
in hand, the research team 
was able to form three-di-
mensional brain images such 
that the brain’s intricate folds 
could be in?ated, and their 
activity could be seen on 
the surface. The researchers 
laid a grid over the three-
dimensional brain in order 
to separate brain regions into 
“voxels,” or 3-D pixels. Each 
voxel’s activity (rate at which 
its neurons ?red over time) 
was recorded and compared 
to that of every other voxel. 
The sample size was so large 
and of such high quality that 
the team was able to compare 
the activity of each voxel in 
one hemisphere of the brain 
to the corresponding region 
on the other hemisphere, 
as well as compare activity 
between voxels of the same 
hemisphere.
As they compared activ-

a weekend?
Stress is a shadow that fol-
lows every college student, 
even on cloudy days — espe-
cially on cloudy days. It is of-
tentimes overwhelming and 
cannot be erased overnight, 
but there is one way to gradu-
ally reduce it: through the 
foods that you eat. According 
to Gill Paul’s book Eat Your-
self Calm, “There are loads 
of delicious, nutritious foods 
that positively support all the 
body systems during periods 
of stress and target the symp-
toms that accompany stress. 
We can literally eat ourselves 
calm.”
Although our bodies do 
a good job of dealing with 
short-term stress, they are 
less victorious when it comes 
to long-term stress. As a re-
sult of chronic stress, your 
immune system lets its guard 
down, your blood sugar lev-
els go on a roller coaster, and 
your blood pressure climbs. 
While most people are famil-
iar with methods of combat-
ting stress such as exercising 
more, getting enough sleep, 
and practicing yoga and med-
itation, fewer people know 
about the bene?ts of a stress-
reducing diet.
One way to 
reduce stress is 
by keeping your 
blood sugar at a steady level, 
because ?uctuating blood 
sugar will unbalance your en-
ergy and mood. 
This can be 
achieved by eat-
ing small snacks 
throughout the day consisting 
of foods that take a long time 
to burn, such as vegetables. 
Today’s Dietitian, a nutrition 
magazine, also explains how 
iron is essential in preventing 
fatigue. Iron is necessary for 
the formation of hemoglobin, 
the molecule which carries 
oxygen from the lungs to the 
rest of your body. Some of the 
best sources for iron include 
thyme, parsley, basil, eggs, 
beef, salmon, almonds, spin-
ach, and broccoli.
Another way to reduce 
stress is by eating foods with 
lots of B vita-
mins. 
According 
to Eat Your-
self Calm “B 
group vita-
mins are par-
ticularly use-
ful because 
they support 
the nervous 
system and 
brain func-
tion and 
stimulate the 
production 
of feel-good 
hormones such as serotonin.” 
Reader’s Digest explained 
the functions of speci?c B vi-
tamins: Vitamin B1, for exam-
ple, helps control your blood 
sugar level. Vitamin B3 plays 
an important role in the syn-
thesis of serotonin. Vitamin 
B5 in?uences the adrenals, 
the glands which regulate 
stress hormones such as cor-
tisol and adrenaline. Vita-
min B12 has been shown to 
be bene?cial for combatting 
depression, which is often 
linked with anxiety. Some 
examples of food which are 
rich in B vitamins are whole 
grains, potatoes, bananas, le-
gumes, oily ?sh, poultry, and 
nuts.
Antioxidants are another 
key to stress reduction, espe-
cially antioxidant vitamins 
A, C, and E, as they can help 
“lower blood pressure, pro-
tect the heart and digestive 
system, and encourage brain 
function,” according to Eat 
Yourself Calm. Fruits and veg-
etables are a good way to get 
antioxidants, especially those 
with the brightest colors.
Finally, reducing your caf-
feine and alcohol consump-
tion can help reduce stress. 
Since caffeine is a stimulant, 
it causes the release of chemi-
cals such as the ?ght or ?ight 
hormone adrenaline, which 
raises your body’s alertness 
and anxiety. Alcohol, al-
though often used to relieve 
stress, can actually prolong 
it. According to an article in 
U.S. News, in some cases al-
cohol can decrease cortisol, 
the hormone which helps the 
body respond to stress, caus-
ing the anxiety to stay for an 
even longer time.
While exercise and sleep 
are critical for reducing stress, 
sometimes it’s hard to ?nd the 
time to ?t in a workout or go 
to bed earlier. Eating, on the 
other hand, is a part of your 
daily routine. Just make sure 
to include some stress reduc-
ing foods in your diet, and 
you’ll be on your way to a hap-
pier lifestyle in no time.

HOW THINGS WORKEating certain foods found to reduce long-term stress  
PUGWASH COLUMNGoogle expands its services
there is little risk of them be-
ing toppled and replaced by 
Google. 
If Google began encroach-
ing on the service providers 
by undercutting them, the 
service providers could simply 
raise the rent or choose to end 
Google’s access to the infra-
structure.
The question of monopo-
lies also applies in the con-
text of public utilities. We 
were unsure about how the 
status changes when utility 
infrastructure is rented out to 
a third party. However, clas-
sifying a service as a utility is 
one of the few ways to prevent 
monopolies from taking ad-
vantage of limited regulation.
Regardless of market com-
petition, some members ex-
pressed distrust that Google 
would have access to their 
data from start to ?nish. 
Google already gathers in-
credible amounts of informa-
tion about people using the 
Internet; do they really need 
more? 
Many modern companies 
have, or are attempting to get, 
similar levels of integration. It 
was mentioned that this could 
be the “honeymoon” period of 
large oligopolies. Just because 
Internet companies like Ama-
zon and Google are providing 
great services now, they might 
decide one day that they want 
to stop operating at a loss.
So far, Google hasn’t run 
into anti-trust laws in the 
United States, beyond a slight 
warning about promoting 
their own search results with-
out disclosure. In the Europe-
an Union, however, there have 
been more legal consequences 
for Google’s reach. Whether 
Google and other massive tech 
companies will ever be chal-
lenged was a question open 
to debate. The current goal of 
many, if not most, startups is 
to grow just big enough to be 
bought out. Although there 
may be some companies, like 
Uber, that resist buyout and 
end up as strong corporations 
themselves, the frequency of 
that happening may be de-
clining. In the Internet ser-
vice provider business, where 
startup costs for small busi-
nesses are incredibly high, it 
can be even harder for a new-
comer to present a real threat 
to the larger, established 
companies.
Whether Google’s move 
into the business of Internet 
service is positive or nega-
tive seems to depend on how 
much one trusts Google. Hav-
ing vertical integration gives 
them more incentive to pro-
vide quality Internet access, 
but at the same time, they are 
now in control of users’ data 
from start to ?nish.
Brill explains data privacyResearchers ?nd unique brain patterns in those with autism
President Subra Suresh. The 
event took place in Rangos in 
the Jared L. Cohon University 
Center.
Back in 2010, Brill became 
the Commissioner of the 
Federal Trade Commission 
(FTC). A magna cum laude 
from Princeton University 
and the New York University 
School of Law, Brill eventu-
ally found herself attracting 
national recognition for her 
work in protecting consumer 
privacy.
The Commissioner be-
lieves that it is possible for us 
to “unlock the potential of big 
data, and enjoy its bene?ts, 
while still obeying the pri-
vacy principles that protect 
individuals.” Brill said that 
one of the main goals of the 
FTC is to protect consumers 
by preventing foul business 
practices in the marketplace.
Brill referenced many ex-
amples of past consumer pri-
vacy violations throughout 
her speech, including a ma-
jor incident from last year in 
which the FTC pressed charg-
es against Snapchat for its lax 
security policies. A third-par-
ty app was found that allowed 
recipients to recover and store 
messages, or “snaps,” that 
were supposed to have disap-
peared. “You can imagine,” 
Brill said to the audience, 
“that a security failure that 
leads to the capture of an im-
age that you thought would 
be ephemeral is a pretty rude 
shock, and undermines [an] 
essential selling point [and] 
privacy enhancement that 
Snapchat was offering.”
During the same year, 
Credit Karma and Fandango 
also settled charges with 
the FTC for misrepresenting 
the security of their mobile 
apps to consumers. The two 
companies failed to secure 
the transmission of highly 
sensitive information due to 
“man-in-the middle” attacks. 
Through these attacks, hack-
ers were able to gain access to 
the credit card details, credit 
report data, and social secu-
rity numbers of consumers.
To further address these 
security issues, the FTC is 
working on enacting federal 
laws to set guidelines that 
would push companies to 
take action. 
In addition, during a 
visit to the FTC, President 
Obama called on Congress 
to pass legislation that would 
“strengthen the FTC’s exist-
ing data security enforcement 
tools” and “provide education 
to consumers” in the event of 
a security breach.
There are, however, com-
panies that are interested in 
?nding ways to protect and 
gain the trust of their con-
sumers. In response, Brill pro-
posed several solutions.
One proposed solution 
was the implementation of 
security by design. A software 
engineering term, security by 
design describes a product 
that was built to be secure 
from the start. Data minimi-
zation and de-identi?cation 
would help to further protect 
consumers from the potential 
risks of providing personal in-
formation.
Brill also encouraged 
companies to become more 
transparent in establishing 
their security policies. Fur-
thermore, she said that con-
sumers should be given more 
tools to control the privacy of 
their data.
But simply enforcing these 
guidelines will not be enough 
to combat the invasion of 
privacy that comes with the 
increasing prevalence of the 
IoT, Brill said. 
Aware that she was speak-
ing to the technology-focused 
Carnegie Mellon community, 
Brill urged the technologists 
in the room to help ensure 
those changes take place. 
While she recognizes this is 
not an easy task, Brill is con-
?dent that the analytical and 
creative skills of computer 
scientists and engineers will 
help companies reach mile-
stones in enhancing data 
security.
Incredible advancements 
in technology show promise 
of a future that greatly differs 
from Orwell’s ?ctional, totali-
tarian society. Digital technol-
ogy may not, after all, become 
the downfall of the sophisti-
cated intelligence that is char-
acteristic of the human race. 
The IoT may even prove to 
be advantageous within the 
modern world, provided that 
we use it mindfully.
Quoting the Cuban revolu-
tionary Fidel Castro, Brill said 
that a “revolution is a struggle 
to the death between the fu-
ture and the past.” Only time 
and the efforts of many can 
bring us the solution to one of 
the 21st century’s most con-
troversial issues.
ity throughout the brain, the 
research team discovered 
that, when compared against 
one another, the connections 
within the brains of the con-
trol groups were similar. The 
connectivity within the ASD 
brains, however, was not only 
different from that of the 
control groups, but the ASD 
brains displayed notable dif-
ferences from one another — 
some being hyper-connected 
and others being under-con-
nected, as previous studies 
had discovered.
The ?ndings support a 
burgeoning hypothesis re-
garding the nature of ASD 
brain development. “There is 
a growing perception that be-
cause we live in very much the 
same kind of environment, 
our brains are all entrained in 
similar ways,” Behrmann ex-
plained. “If we see a dog, for 
example, and hear it barking, 
the visual and auditory stimu-
lus come together, and those 
brain regions work together.”
While typical individuals’ 
brains develop and work in 
similar ways, individuals with 
ASD display diverse and rath-
er unique connectivity pro-
?les. Researchers hypothesize 
that not only do their envi-
ronmental experiences shape 
their connectivity, their con-
nectivity shapes their ability 
to interact with the environ-
ment. This is demonstrated by 
the fact that some young ASD 
individuals tend not to look 
at other people’s faces. As a 
result, the brain region which 
works to identify faces is im-
paired because it has not been 
utilized frequently enough.
As with many neuroscien-
ti?c studies, the rami?cations 
are unclear. “One of the things 
we had originally hoped was 
that, if we had a large sample, 
we could see individuals who 
had clusters of activity,” Beh-
rmann said. 
The goal was to ?nd simi-
lar patterns which could have 
been used to create neurologi-
cal pro?les for ASD individu-
als, perhaps for diagnostic 
use, but the results were far 
too varied. “Before we can 
even start thinking about how 
we can use this information, 
we need to have a re?ned 
characterization of the dis-
order. Autism spectrum dis-
order is de?ned subjectively 
by a set of behavioral traits, 
a checklist. We really need an 
objective measure that allows 
for a more precise diagnosis 
before we can consider using 
this data.”
While ASD may still be 
mysterious, discoveries like 
this advance our understand-
ing of brain disorders and 
neuroscience as a whole. 
“We are entering a new era 
in neuroscience research” 
Behrmann said. “Not only is 
the science itself exciting, but 
there is great joy in working 
collaboratively. The process 
of discovery and working with 
other people really drive me 
and make me excited about 
this work.”

Measles isn’t very magical, vaccinate your children
Love the football game, hate the toxic sports culture
In the mid-1960s, researchers dis-
covered and licensed the ?rst vaccine 
for the measles, an overwhelmingly 
deadly disease. Now, many consider 
measles to be a disease of the past.
In some communities, however, 
measles is still infecting children. 
In Marin County, CA., 6.45 per-
cent of children in public schools, 
compared to a 2.5 percent average 
statewide, have a “personal belief 
exemption,” according to NPR. 
Children with a personal belief 
exemption are not required to get 
available vaccines for communica-
ble diseases, which in most states 
include polio, hepatitis B, varicel-
la, measles, and others.
Right now there are 109 con-
?rmed measles cases in the United 
States, according to Mashable, 
most of which originated in Cali-
fornia’s Disneyland. The crowded 
amusement park acted as the per-
fect incubator for measles, and the 
outbreak even affected six people 
who were vaccinated.
Most parents’ aversion to vacci-
nation stems from fears that certain 
ingredients in vaccines are linked 
to Autism Spectrum Disorder. The 
Center for Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC), among other repu-
table health institutions, however, 
has dispelled that notion in more re-
cent studies. In fact, the 1998 Lancet 
study that originated the myth of a 
vaccine-autism link was later retract-
ed for unethical and fraudulent sci-
enti?c practices, according to CNN.
It is dangerous for parents to re-
fuse to vaccinate their children, and 
the more unvaccinated children 
there are, the more likely it is that 
those who are vaccinated will be in-
fected, as they were in Disneyland. 
In addition, herd immunity is depen-
dent on a critical majority of the pop-
ulation being vaccinated. Anti-vacci-
nation parents are not only putting 
their own children at risk, but also 
anyone unable to be vaccinated, 
including infants under 12 months 
of age and those with extenuating 
medical circumstances.
Vaccination-dubious parents 
should not be the cause of a new 
pandemic. Measles is entirely pre-
ventable. The measles, mumps, 
and rubella (MMR) vaccine is 95 
percent effective, and is directly 
responsible for the 99 percent re-
duction in United States measles 
cases, according to the CDC. 
Not only is there no connection 
between the MMR vaccine and au-
tism, but the MMR vaccine is wide-
ly considered one of the safest and 
most effective vaccines currently 
available.
Parents who refuse to vaccinate 
their children are contributing to 
an easily preventable problem, and 
should consider the dangers of re-
fusing vaccination, for both an in-
dividual child and the surrounding 
community.
During Sunday’s Super Bowl, the 
NFL aired a PSA in partnership with 
No More, an organization dedicated 
to raising awareness for issues of do-
mestic violence and sexual assault. 
Recent major sporting events like 
the Super Bowl and World Cup have 
brought protests and campaigns 
around these subjects. 
While these issues are signi?cant 
and deserve recognition, there is a 
danger in vilifying the sport itself 
instead of the abusers. Football is a 
violent sport, but there needs to be 
a distinction between the game and 
manufactured football culture.
Survivors of sexual assault de-
serve support, and backing from 
major organizations like the NFL can 
go a long way in spreading aware-
ness that assault is an addressable 
legal issue. However, the NFL and 
organizations like it contribute to a 
toxic image of masculinity, in which 
a man should compete with and 
dominate those around him. This 
behavior plays a role in the power 
and control that can lead to domestic 
violence and abusive relationships. 
Men perpetrate domestic violence 
at much higher rates than women, 
and unrealistic views of men in soci-
ety certainly contribute to the ethos 
of proving one’s strength. Celebrity 
athletes and raucous fan culture can 
also perpetuate an unhealthy image 
of male dominance.
The problem with blaming the 
sport alone, as some of the protests 
have, is that it excuses perpetrators 
and discredits male survivors. Male 
survivors face additional stigma as-
sociated with their masculinity, so 
blaming a hyper-masculine culture 
for sexual assault can be harmful 
for men who have been assaulted by 
women or by other men.
Blaming a hyper-masculine cul-
ture also excuses instances of vio-
lence as angry outbursts. Alcohol is 
commonly associated with instances 
of domestic violence, and sporting 
events are often attached to drinking 
culture. When intoxicated fans be-
come passionate or angry, violence 
may result. At the game, this leads 
to stadium ?ghts. At home, family 
members may be in danger. Anger, 
however, is not an appropriate ex-
cuse for domestic violence. Alcohol is 
not to blame here — abusers should 
be held accountable.
The NFL has a unique place in 
America as an icon of masculinity. 
Cases of domestic abuse among its 
players have received recent media 
attention, including criticism that 
the League does not go far enough 
to punish perpetrators. Domestic 
violence is not solely the result of the 
sport or the organization behind it, 
but such a prominent organization 
should take measures to prevent vio-
lence and educate men about harm-
ful relationships. The PSA was an 
important step toward recognizing 
the issue (especially during an event 
when people are watching commer-
cials) but did not address violence 
prevention or support following an 
incident of violence.
Ted Cruz equals catastrophe for U.S. scienti?c future
Earlier this month, Senator Ted 
Cruz was named chair of the newly 
renamed Subcommittee on Space, 
Science, and Competitiveness. He 
is expected to be con?rmed in the 
coming days. The subcommittee has 
several major responsibilities. These 
include deciding where to allocate 
money for science and overseeing 
several government organizations 
with scienti?c goals, most notably 
NASA.
This appointment led to a simul-
taneous cringe from much of the 
country, as Cruz is a noted science 
denier who believes in neither cli-
mate change nor government spend-
ing in general. However, while his 
appointment is certainly a mistake, 
the true disaster of it lies in Cruz’s 
publicly-stated goals that some con-
sider reasons for cautious optimism.
Loudly, Cruz is in favor of giving 
NASA the power to explore space 
and establishing the United States 
as the world’s foremost space power, 
according to The Huf?ngton Post. He 
constantly trumpets the need for 
more space exploration. He has two 
major policy goals in this regard. 
The ?rst is that — due to America’s 
icy relationship with Russia — he 
wants to reduce reliance on Russian 
space stations, an aim that has more 
to do with politics here on earth than 
space itself.
Another reason is that Cruz is a 
senator from Texas and has always 
been a ?ghter for his home state’s 
interest. Texas bene?ts massively 
from the aerospace industry, home 
to many giants who receive large 
contracts from the government such 
as the Dallas-based Lockheed Martin 
Aeronautics unit. Reduced reliance 
on Russia would help the local indus-
try operate at maximum ef?ciency 
since there are fewer outside barriers 
and international tensions.
The second policy goal is to culti-
vate private space exploration com-
panies such as SpaceX. Cruz believes 
that these companies are good for 
both the ef?ciency of space explora-
tion and the country’s economy as a 
whole.
All of this sounds encouraging, 
but a slightly deeper reading shows 
that Cruz might have an ulterior 
motive. Space exploration is largely 
apolitical, which seems to be why 
Cruz is so intent on it. His exact 
words did not mention providing ad-
ditional resources to NASA in order 
to achieve his policy objectives; they 
were about focusing NASA’s goal.
That means something has to be 
cut out of the picture, and that thing 
appears to be climate change re-
search, which NASA has been at the 
forefront of for a decade now.
Space is not Cruz’s only respon-
sibility, but it seems to be his entire 
focus. Funneling money into a par-
ticular area of science not only fails 
to meet his job description, but given 
Cruz’s permanent battle to slash 
funding in all ways possible, indi-
cates that he is actively shirking his 
responsibilities for political gain.
It’s always good to have a pow-
erful advocate of space exploration 
?ghting for money to explore space, 
as acquiring any sort of budget is al-
ways a battle. However, it is danger-
ous to confuse being an advocate of 
space exploration with being an ad-
vocate of NASA. Based on Cruz’s vot-
ing record and failure to champion 
the causes he is now in charge of, his 
appointment casts a gloomy shadow 
over the immediate future of scien-
ti?c research, NASA included.
New HoloLens tech lights up imagination
GORDON ESTES
Junior Staffwriter
With all of the hullabaloo sur-
rounding the recent Microsoft news 
releases, it’s no surprise that the 
newly announced Microsoft Holo-
Lens has rocketed to the top of head-
lines this past week. Windows 10 is 
one thing; a major company step-
ping into the world of augmented 
reality (AR) is another.
Other companies are working on 
virtual reality (VR) — Oculus being 
the most notable example — but 
it’s Microsoft that seems to be tak-
ing the lead in the realm of AR. The 
now-discontinued Google Glass was 
barely a heads-up display (HUD); 
the HoloLens, Microsoft is promis-
ing, will be able to do much more.
Most people are probably famil-
iar with the idea of a virtual reality, 
but AR is a different can of worms 
entirely. Instead of transporting you 
to another world, the HoloLens is 
intended to bring the digital world 
to the real one. While Google Glass 
prevented interaction with the out-
side world, the HoloLens will be a 
much more intimate merger of the 
Windows 10 OS and the world right 
outside of your computer.
VR currently has great poten-
tial for the entertainment industry, 
but it’s AR that truly has the power 
to change the world as we know it 
today. Some of the demos that Mi-
crosoft showed off included a 3-D 
model editor, an army of ?oating, 
movable screens, and a playable 
Minecraft world sitting right on your 
living room table. These are some of 
the obvious applications: the crowd 
pleasers, if you will. But the other 
possibilities are even more exciting.
Take the guided instructions 
overlay that Microsoft showed off at 
the conference. When using that, an-
other person can watch your visual 
feed and sketch in arrows or notes to 
help you complete a task. This could 
be incredibly valuable in the medi-
cal ?eld, both as a learning tool and 
as an instrument to help treat pa-
tients in isolated communities. This 
overlay technology will only become 
more valuable down the line, espe-
cially when integrated with services 
like Google Maps. You won’t need to 
glance down at the GPS when your 
route is drawn in bright red on the 
pavement.
Due to the ubiquity of social me-
dia today, it’s only appropriate that 
we expand our expectations of the 
future to encompass them as well. 
Geocaching, an activity where peo-
ple go hiking or exploring to ?nd ob-
jects hidden by people online or in 
clubs, has already become a popular 
hobby in today’s urbanized society. 
Imagine cybercaching — exploring 
your neighborhood or home to ?nd 
a digital object or program waiting 
somewhere for you to ?nd it.
This idea of “tagging” outdoor ar-
eas could extend easily to commer-
cial venues as well. Imagine the Yelp 
of the future, where you can ?nd 
virtual reviews and ratings hanging 
outside of the door of your favorite 
restaurant, or a Facebook feature 
that lets you leave comments, pic-
tures, or videos at a given location 
for anyone to see.
Let’s take a moment to also ap-
preciate the entertainment value of 
AR. We’ve already seen Microsoft 
bring Minecraft to the real world, 
but imagine engaging in virtual 
Pokemon battles with people or 
friends on the street. You could de-
sign an interactive HUD for use in 
a tabletop game, create an app that 
lets users appear to “waterbend,” 
or even play YuGiOh the way it was 
always meant to be played — with 
ridiculous, over-the-top holographic 
monsters.
Given the success of the Oculus, 
more than one person has speculat-
ed that the way of the future seems 
to be open sourced. If that’s true, 
then it may be time to start think-
ing of new ways that you’d like to 
interact with the world around you. 
With a technology with as much po-
tential as the HoloLens, it won’t be 
long before programming reality 
becomes the next big thing. When 
it comes to AR, the entire physical 
world — and the digital one — is at 
your ?ngertips.

Venture for America will help you build your dream career
My career found me. Now that I’m 
working full-time on my startup, it’s 
amazing to me that I even imagined 
doing anything else. I studied entre-
preneurship and music technology at 
Carnegie Mellon, and I’m the business 
development guy at my music tech 
startup. It’s like I picked this career 
path when I applied to this school.
Simply put, I love what I do. The 
existential crises of junior year — 
when I didn’t know how to make my 
career revolve around music — have 
vanished now that I wake up every 
morning with the intent of changing 
the way music is made in 2015, our 
mantra here at the of?ce. 
I truly am blessed to have found 
my incredible co-founders, all of 
whom share my passion and drive 
for helping musicians work together, 
and that we were able to start a com-
pany together.
But I’m one of the lucky ones. 
Not everyone ?nds their calling in 
college. In fact, I think most people 
don’t. It’s incredibly easy to get fun-
neled into the typical paths for your 
major, as that’s where a lot of people 
will guide you, but those avenues 
don’t necessarily represent the best 
way to ful?ll your passion. If those 
paths seem unsatisfying, consider en-
trepreneurship.
While it may seem daunting to 
forego the security of a traditional 
career path to push the boundaries of 
innovation forward, the entry barri-
ers to starting a company have never 
been lower than they are now. Af-
ter reading last week’s article about 
Teach for America, I felt compelled 
to write about Venture for America, 
one organization that’s lowering the 
barriers to entry for college students 
seeking to get involved in entrepre-
neurship.
Like Teach for America, Venture 
for America Fellows are recent col-
lege graduates who do a two-year 
fellowship at a startup, rather than 
a school. Venture for America’s mis-
sion is to help bring startup culture 
to cities that are struggling to keep 
their economies a?oat. Venture for 
America Fellows won’t be going to 
the Bay Area, but instead will spend 
their fellowship in cities like Detroit, 
Baltimore, Philadelphia, St. Louis, 
Las Vegas, or Miami.
Venture for America picked these 
cities because it turns out entrepre-
neurship is really good for the econ-
omy. Every year, existing businesses 
hemorrhage jobs and opportunity, 
and it’s up to new businesses to create 
more jobs than existing business lose. 
New business activity is the source of 
the majority of the economic growth 
in the country, and the prosperity 
that we all share as Americans was 
created by generations of enterpris-
ing entrepreneurs building off each 
other’s successes. Venture for Ameri-
ca was created to bring the prosperity 
that comes with entrepreneurship to 
areas that are underserved by the in-
novators that they need.
The best part about Venture for 
America, though, is the work you’ll 
be doing and the people you’ll be 
with. I’ve worked at three startups 
now, and each time I’ve noticed that 
the people I’m around are some of 
the most driven, talented, and pas-
sionate people I’ve ever met. 
Better yet, they’re all committed 
to changing the world in some way. 
Relay Network is changing the way 
that companies communicate with 
their customers. Clutch is changing 
the way that companies engage their 
customers. My latest company, Nebu-
lus, is changing the way people make 
music.
As a Venture for America Fellow, 
you’ll be doing irreplaceable, impact-
ful work in an organization that is 
seeking to shape the world in its im-
age, all while helping revitalize an ur-
ban environment that’s desperately 
in need of your talent. You also get to 
pick the domain of the startup where 
you’re placed, so you can make sure 
you’re working on a company that’s 
full of people who see the world the 
way you do.
As you move forward through 
Carnegie Mellon, seeking ful?llment 
and career advancement, consider 
joining Venture for America. Your tal-
ents can make a massive difference in 
your startup, your community and, 
eventually, change the world for the 
better.

I’ve been wary of Narendera 
Modi ever since he came into of?ce 
as the prime minister of India, and 
Obama’s recent visit to India and the 
blossoming relationship between 
the two countries just con?rmed my 
uneasiness.
Modi is part of the Bharatiya 
Janata Party, the Hindu national-
ist party in India. Before running 
for prime minister, he was the chief 
minister of a state called Gujarat, 
which is equivalent to a governor of 
a state here. While in charge of Gu-
jarat, he made great progress with 
infrastructure within the state, get-
ting electricity and water to more 
people than ever before. But when 
riots broke out between religious 
Hindu nationalists and Muslims fol-
lowing the destruction of a Muslim 
tinderbox, Gujarat soon gained in-
ternational recognition for another 
reason. After the burning of a train 
that was ?lled with Hindu pilgrims, 
the riots soon turned into an almost 
all-out massacre of thousands of 
Muslims.
Modi did not do anything to stop 
the violence while in power. He 
ordered of?cials to take no action 
against rioters, and was complicit 
in the dismissal of many police and 
court cases against Hindu rioters, 
according to The New York Times. 
On top of all of this, there are also 
allegations that Modi was actually 
actively perpetuating the violence 
against Muslims. The United States 
actually imposed travel restrictions 
on Modi during this time for his role 
in the riots. Even so, he was eventu-
ally re-elected as chief minister on a 
platform of uniting Hindus, largely 
around a fear of Muslims.
With the United States’ own 
shaky history with 
Islam and the 
Middle 
East, 
this 
closer 
relationship 
between the 
United States and 
India is incredibly 
worrisome. It might 
be great for both coun-
tries individually, but 
not for the international 
Muslim community as a 
whole or other countries, 
especially Pakistan and 
China.
India and Pakistan have 
had a long and violent history, start-
ing and ending with the con?ict 
over the border in the Kashmir re-
gion. U.S.–Pakistan relations have 
been shaky ever since 9/11, and 
have increasingly worsened after 
the death of Osama Bin Laden. On 
one hand, we found him in their 
country, which brings into ques-
tion their commitment to eradicat-
ing terrorism in the region, but on 
the other hand we stepped all over 
Pakistan’s sovereignty as a nation by 
sending in a SEAL team and killing 
someone on their soil without even 
consulting them.
Pakistan’s foreign policy chief 
Sartaj Aziz warned of “India’s dan-
gerous desire to create a space for 
war,” while Sherry Rahman, a for-
mer Pakistani information minister 
added, “Relations between India 
and Pakistan are in tatters,” accord-
ing to The Wall Street Journal. Ever 
since Modi came to power, this has 
de?nitely been the norm. Peace 
talks have been called off and Paki-
stan’s attempts to revive dialogue 
have been rebuffed, all while Modi 
continues to accuse Islamabad of not 
taking enough action against terror-
ists. Meanwhile, there is growing 
aggravation that Obama has now 
visited India twice during his presi-
dency but has not visited Pakistan 
even once. China, however, has been 
reaching out to Pakistan more and 
more. While Modi and Obama were 
hugging in New Delhi, Pakistan’s 
army chief was on an of?cial visit to 
Beijing. China is also regarding the 
U.S.–India relationship with vague 
suspicion, according to The New 
York Times. During Modi’s talks with 
Obama, the security quadrilateral 
he proposed included the United 
States, India, Japan, and Australia, 
which was worrying to China.
The South China Sea con?ict, 
and China’s recent in?ammatory 
moves in the region, were other top-
ics of the talks. At Obama’s urging, 
Modi signed a statement criticizing 
China for how it handled the situ-
ation. There is also the threat that 
will result from the United States in-
creasing sales of military technology 
to India. This development comes 
right after China lost its hold as In-
dia’s number one trade partner, a 
huge blow to China and worrisome 
for the nation on the security front.
Improving Indo–U.S. relations 
are great for both nations, and as 
an Indian-American, I’m happy to 
see the countries’ relations growing 
and forming in a new direction, but 
I’m still very wary of the public and 
overt way that this is happening, es-
pecially because both countries have 
had many issues regarding Islama-
phobia in the very recent past, and 
both countries are now in the posi-
tion to be extremely in?uential on 
the international stage. I just hope 
their in?uence is a good one.

DEBATE: Are improving Indo-U.S. relations good news?
ABHISHEK TAYAL
Junior Staffwriter
President Obama made history in 
India last week by becoming the ?rst 
United States president to attend In-
dia’s Republic Day Parade as its chief 
guest. Held every year on the 26th 
of January since 1950, Republic Day 
commemorates India adopting its 
constitution to become a democratic 
republic.
Traditionally, the chief guests at 
these parades have been the heads of 
India’s old allies. For example, Japa-
nese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe took 
on the role in 2014, French Presi-
dent Nicolas Sarkozy in 2008, and 
Russian President Vladimir Putin in 
2007. As such, President Obama’s at-
tendance signals a new era of strong 
alliance between India and the Unit-
ed States that will be highly bene?-
cial to both countries.
Obama and Indian Prime Minis-
ter Narendra Modi seemed to enjoy 
each other’s company. From joking 
about how little sleep they get as 
heads of state to hosting a joint radio 
broadcast, they reveled in the atten-
tion of the Indian media circus, pro-
viding sound bite after sound bite. 
Modi referred to Obama as “Barack,” 
and spoke expressively about how 
he and Obama shared a personal 
chemistry. Obama, not to be out-
done, greeted his audiences with 
a “Namaskaar” and found the time 
to try his hand at a famous Bol-
lywood movie dialogue. 
As such, both Obama 
and Modi pulled out 
all the stops to cre-
ate an image of intense 
personal camaraderie.
Grand gestures aside, 
the visit also included 
measurable progress. 
Both nations have simi-
lar concerns — from 
China’s assertiveness in 
the Asia Paci?c region 
to terrorism in the 
Middle East and the 
threat of Climate 
Change — 
that were 
finally 
addressed as a team.
Several of these issues were ad-
dressed through a Joint Statement. 
In an oblique reference to China, the 
statement “af?rmed the importance 
of safeguarding maritime security 
and ensuring freedom of navigation 
and over ?ight throughout the re-
gion, especially in the South China 
Sea.” The United States needs a 
strong regional partner to contain 
China to effect its “rebalance to Asia” 
policy. For India to stake a credible 
regional claim of its own, it needs an 
ally as powerful as the United States.
On the topic of terrorism, Obama 
and Modi “stressed the need for joint 
and concerted efforts, including the 
dismantling of safe havens for terror-
ist and criminal networks, to disrupt 
all ?nancial and tactical support for 
networks such as Al Qaeda, Lashkar-
e Taiba, Jaish-e-Mohammad, the 
D-Company, and the Haqqanis.” In-
dia and the United States have both 
been victims of horrendous attacks 
from these organizations. Any kind 
of cooperation — from the sharing 
of intelligence to co-ordination of 
troops and equipment — is mutually 
bene?cial.
The most substantial progress, 
however, was in clean energy. Mas-
sive hurdles in a dormant Indo-U.S. 
civil nuclear deal, signed in 2008, 
were cleared. An overreaching nu-
clear accident liability law in India 
was worked around through the es-
tablishment of a multimillion-dollar 
insurance pool.
A United States require-
ment that all nuclear exports 
to India be 
tracked 
in real 
time 
was 
waived 
since it was 
considered in-
trusive. This 
clears the 
way for Indi-
an and United 
States companies to work together to 
set up nuclear power plants through-
out India. This is very good news for 
energy-starved India, large parts of 
which receive electricity for less than 
the whole day, according to the Wall 
Street Journal. This is also very good 
news for the United States, now well 
positioned to become the primary 
supplier of India’s massive energy 
modernization drive. Finally, re-
ducing India’s dependence on coal-
?red plants is great for the environ-
ment and thereby bene?cial to both 
countries.
Signi?cant progress was also 
made in the ?eld of defense exports 
and imports. The US is the world’s 
largest exporter of defense equip-
ment, and India is the world’s largest 
importer of defense equipment, ac-
cording to the International Business 
Times. Even so, historically, defense 
trade between the two countries has 
been depressingly anemic.
However, this past week agree-
ments have been signed between the 
United States and India that allow 
for the coproduction of weapons, as 
well as the transfer of technology to 
India that allow weapons designed in 
the US to be manufactured in India. 
Besides being another massive boost 
to trade, the export of manufactur-
ing capability of defense equipment 
to India is particularly signi?cant as 
it implies a trust that extends beyond 
the civilian realm and into the highly 
sensitive realm of defense.
Obama’s visit to India represents 
the ?nal realization of a relationship 
that seems only natural. Both coun-
tries have been stable democracies 
since their inception. Both countries 
are home to people from a multitude 
of ethnicities and religions. As such, 
both countries have a deep respect 
for secular thought and are home to 
a wide swathe of often oppositional 
views. Finally, people in both coun-
tries enjoy freedom of speech, and 
can openly and publicly speak out 
for or against those in power without 
fear of retribution. Culturally and 
ideologically, there could hardly 
be two closer large countries than 
India and the United States, and 
these new, stronger Indo-U.S. 
ties will prove highly bene?cial to 
both nations.

SPORTS BRIEFSPoor playcall gives Pats SB
Women’s Basketball
On Friday night, the Carn-
egie Mellon women’s bas-
ketball team traveled to St. 
Louis to take on Washington 
University. The 9th ranked 
Bears were the toughest of the 
teams the Tartans have played 
so far in University Athletic 
Association (UAA) confer-
ence play and it showed when 
Carnegie Mellon lost 73–49.
The Tartans were cold 
shooting the ball, with only 
three made baskets the rest 
of the half (and of those only 
a layup by freshman forward 
Kajae Jones came in the last 
?ve minutes) and found 
themselves down 14 at half, 
39–25.
Any hopes of a comeback 
were struck down with a 
similar poor shooting effort 
to open the second half, again 
with only three made baskets 
in the half’s opening ten min-
utes.
The loss drops the Tartans 
to 11–6 on the season and 2–4 
in UAA play. They traveled to 
Chicago on Sunday to ?nish 
off their road trip before re-
turning home this weekend to 
face off against Washington 
and Chicago again on their 
home court.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team contin-
ued their woes in UAA play as 
they traveled to Washington 
University in St. Louis to face 
off against the 7th ranked 
Bears. The Tartans ended up 
dropping their 4th straight 
game, 79–59, as they got 
blown out by ranked oppo-
nents for the second time in 
as many games.
The Tartans started off 
strong with sophomore for-
ward Jack Serbin making the 
opening basket and a layup by 
junior center Blake Chasen, 
giving the Tartans a 4–2 lead. 
Unfortunately, this was the 
last time Carnegie Mellon 
would be ahead as Washing-
ton proceeded to tear off a 
15–1 run.
Coming out of the half the 
two teams were fairly even, 
but with Washington already 
having a 10 point advantage, 
it just wasn’t enough. Half-
way through the second half, 
the Tartans went cold from 
the ?eld as they pushed a bit 
too hard to try and cut the 
lead. The points not off of free 
throws were a lone layup by 
senior Kevin Stursberg.
With the loss, the Tartans 
drop to 1–5 in UAA play and 
10–7 on the season. Similar to 
the women’s team, the men 
battled University of Chicago 
on the road Sunday and will 
return back home this week-
end to take on Washington 
and Chicago again.
Swimming & Diving
On Saturday the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
competed at University of 
Pittsburgh. The men com-
peted in a tri meet against 
the University of Pittsburgh 
and Clarion University, and 
ultimately fell to Pitt 216–81 
but beat Clarion 223–58. 
The women faced off in the 
quint meet with Pitt, Clari-
on, California University of 
Pennsylvania and Duquesne 
University in their tune up to 
UAA Championships in two 
weeks. The women lost to 
Pitt 234–60 and Duquesne 
172–113 while defeating the 
California 214–61 and Clarion 
185.50–105.50.
The men got their ?rst win 
of the day from freshman Josh 
Taekman in the 1000 yard 
freestyle, where he dropped 
4 seconds off of his seed time 
to win in 9:52.84. Sophomore 
Brian Jay and freshman Tyler 
Goulding took second and 
third in the 50–yard freestyle 
?nishing with times of 21.42 
and 21.74 respectively.
The only other top show-
ing for the Tartans came from 
sophomore Brian Walsh in 
the 100–yard butter?y, as he 
touched the pad at the 51.06 
mark. Walsh also placed third 
in the 200–yard freestyle with 
a time of 1:44.02. In the ?nal 
event, the 200–yard freestyle 
relay, Carnegie Mellon took 
second when Goulding, Jay, 
junior Joseph Robinson, and 
freshman Kevin Steinhouse 
combined for a 1:25.58 time.
The weakness of the men’s 
team, the diving, continued to 
be problematic as the men’s 
divers were outclassed by 
their ?eld, ?nishing in the last 
spots in both the 1 and 3 me-
ter events, putting up scores 
over one hundred points be-
hind the next competitor.
Due to the strength of the 
?eld, the women’s highest ?n-
ish in an event was multiple 
third-place times. Freshman 
Sarah Winget earned two 
third-place ?nishes with a 
pair of season best times in 
the 200 yard butter?y and the 
500 yard freestyle with times 
of 2:09.82 and 5:18.35.
Another pair of freshman 
picked up third-place ?nishes 
when Miranda Ford took third 
in the 1000 yard freestyle and 
Hannah Soltz took the 100–
yard breaststroke with times 
of 11:15.59 and 1:06.19 re-
spectively.
Machika Kaku was the 
top Tartan diver, taking ?fth 
in the 1 meter with a time of 
232.85.
Both teams next compete 
in the UAA Championships 
in Atlanta starting on 
February 11th.
Track & Field
On Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
track and ?eld teams traveled 
to Case Western Reserve to 
compete in the Seventh An-
nual Battle of the Obelisk. 
The women fell 81–55 while 
the men lost 70–66.
Junior Sasha Spalding 
was the ?rst top ?nisher for 
the women at the meet with 
5.27m leap in the long jump. 
Spalding followed this up 
with a 10.86m hurl to win the 
shot put. Senior Sara Kelly 
took the ?rst track event for 
the Tartans with a win in the 
1 mile run in 5:32.95.
It was a top-two ?nish 
for Carnegie Mellon in the 
400-meter dash with fresh-
man Sarah Cook and sopho-
more Ariel Tian taking ?rst 
and second with times of 
1:01.03 and 1:04.42 respec-
tively. Spalding and Cook re-
peated the feat in the 200 me-
ter dash with times of 26.63 
and 27.71 respectively. The ?-
nal win of the day came in the 
4x400 meter relay where the 
Tartan ‘A’ team took the top 
spot with a time of 4:13.28.
On the men’s side, they 
struggled a bit more with ?eld 
events, not taking a single 
event. But they more than 
made up for it on the track 
side. Freshman Jeffrey Chen 
took ?rst in the 55 meter dash 
with a time 6.66 while sopho-
more Cutris Watro took the 
top spot in the mile run with a 
4:28.31. In the 400 meter run, 
senior Thomas Vandenberg 
won with a time 48.90 and 
in the 800 meter run, junior 
Marc–Daniel Julien took the 
title in 1:57.97. Vandenberg 
also took the 200 meter dash 
in 22.72 seconds to cap off 
the Tartan domination in the 
dashes.
The Tartans dominated 
distance, starting with the 
distance medley with their 
‘A’ team ?nishing in 10:34.74. 
Senior George Degen and 
sophomore Ryan Archer took 
?rst and second in the 5000 
meter run with 15:13.63 and 
15:16.37 respectively, while 
senior Eamon Cullinane, se-
nior Joshua Antonson, De-
gen, and junior Brian Bollens, 
took the top for spots in the 
3000 meter run with times 
of 8:53.07, 8:53.29, 8:53.75, 
and 8:56.94 respectively.
The teams next compete at 
Denison University on Satur-
day in the Bob Shannon Invi-
tational.

For a game full of ?rsts 
(two career ?rst intercep-
tions and a player who has 
been on an NFL roster for less 
than two months getting his 
?rst catch, touchdown, and 
hundred yard game), it was 
sad to see it all end on what 
will be one of the most scru-
tinized play calls in NFL his-
tory. Down by 4 with under a 
minute to go, the Seattle Se-
ahawks faced a 2nd and goal 
from the 1 yard line. With 
one of the best running backs 
in the league in Marshawn 
“Beast Mode” Lynch, Seattle 
made the inexplicable deci-
sion to try and pass the ball 
for the touchdown.
As famous University of 
Texas coach, Darrell K. Royal 
said, “Only three things can 
happen when you pass, and 
two of them are bad.” Royal 
was referring to the good, a 
catch, the bad, an incomple-
tion, and the ugly — an in-
terception. Sadly for the Se-
ahawks, this throw was ugly. 
Patriots rookie cornerback 
Malcolm Butler pulled in his 
?rst career interception as 
he sold out to cover the quick 
underneath route, putting 
a quick end to the Seattle 
comeback.
Two plays earlier, Seattle 
wide out Jermaine Kearse 
made what would have been 
the catch of the century, hav-
ing the ball tipped away by 
Butler only to have it bounce 
off his legs as he laid on the 
ground, off one hand and ?-
nally corralled at the 6 yard 
line only to get up and pop 
out of bounds to stop the 
clock at the 5 yard line. This 
catch would have been an 
all-time great, right up there 
with New York Giants’ wide-
out David Tyree’s helmet 
catch to end the Patriots’ un-
defeated season in 2007 and 
the immaculate reception by 
Steelers’ fullback Franco Har-
ris in 1972. But it will be for-
gotten because of a bad play 
call, a bad read and a correct 
sell out play by a rookie in the 
biggest game of his life.
The game started slow, 
with both defenses dominat-
ing. The Patriots completely 
stonewalled the Seahawks, 
allowing only a few rushing 
?rst downs and a complete 
lack of a passing. The Se-
ahawks held more of a “bend, 
don’t break” philosophy, let-
ting the Patriots drive but 
getting a crucial interception 
from nickel corner Jeremy 
Lane in the red zone. The eu-
phoric high Lane experienced 
from getting his ?rst career 
interception during the Super 
Bowl was quickly smashed as 
he broke his arm getting tack-
led as he tried to gain better 
?eld position.
Undrafted Chris Matthews 
was the next unheralded 
player to leave his mark on 
the game as his ?rst career 
catch was a spinning leap-
ing grab over New England 
nickel corner Kyle Arrington 
on a long bomb by Seahawks’ 
quarterback Russell Wilson. 
His second career catch was 
a touchdown to culminate a 
30-second drive after the Pa-
triots scored a touchdown to 
break a 7–7 tie with 32 sec-
onds remaining. 
There was another inter-
esting play call made during 
this drive as the Seahawks 
were sitting at the 11 yard 
line with 6 seconds remain-
ing. Many were calling for 
the chip shot ?eld goal to 
guarantee points leading into 
half, but Seattle thought they 
could ?re one shot into the 
end zone before settling for 
3 points. Wilson threw near-
ly instantaneously after the 
snap (similar to the end of 
the game) but this time found 
an open Matthews, again 
leaping and spinning around 
Arrington to land in the end 
zone to knot the game at 14.
Coming out of half, the 
Seahawks got the ball and 
were determined to keep up 
their momentum, scoring an-
other 10 points to jump out 
to a 24–14 lead as the fourth 
quarter begin. While most 
teams would be left for dead 
down double digits against 
the league’s best defense, 
the Patriots (who had two 
separate 14-point comebacks 
against the Baltimore Ravens 
in the divisional round of the 
playoffs) just kept ?ghting. 
With a short pass to former 
quarterback-turned-receiver 
Julian Edelman, Tom Brady 
and Patriots took the lead 
back with 2:06 remaining 
in the game, and we already 
discussed what happens next. 
Brady’s fourth passing touch-
down was enough to over-
come his two interceptions 
and earn him Super Bowl 
MVP honors, although that 
honor probably deserved to 
go to the Seahawks offensive 
play caller.
With the Patriots 28–24 
victory, Brady and longtime 
coach Bill Belichick get their 
fourth title, and ?rst in the last 
decade, but the game was tar-
nished. No one likes to see a 
game decided by the referees, 
but to see one decided by one 
over thought play call makes 
the game feel tarnished. The 
Super Bowl is supposed to 
decide the best team, not the 
best coaches. While coaches 
certainly have a large role in 
how their team plays on the 
?eld, they should not be the 
ones deciding games.
Congratulations to the Pa-
triots, but maybe next year 
they should focus a bit more 
on the running game — They 
of all people know best, “that 
only 3 things happen when 
you pass, and two of them are 
bad.”

Why academic and physical endurance are not the same
ANDY BIRLA
Junior Staffwriter
Students at Carnegie Mel-
lon are not strangers to en-
durance. For 30 weeks of the 
year, they go through grueling 
homework and stressful mid-
terms only to be confronted 
by a barrage of hellish ?nals 
at the end. Running 26 miles, 
then, should be a feat far eas-
ier to accomplish. The only 
problem, however, is that it is 
really not easy.
This week at Carnegie Mel-
lon, Matt Imhof gave a talk 
to students and faculty about 
how to train for a Marathon/
Half Marathon. Imhof is a 
USA Track and Field Certi?ed 
Coach and has been an ACE 
Certi?ed Personal Trainer for 
over 20 years, during which 
he has coached hundreds of 
adult runners to their ?rst 
half or full marathons. He was 
formerly the Head Track and 
Cross-Country Coach at Kean 
University in New Jersey and 
currently works as the Direc-
tor of Training Programs at 
Elite Runners and Walkers in 
Pittsburgh.
Imhof truly is a coach at 
heart, as both his most memo-
rable running moments and 
his source of continued moti-
vation are the joyous faces of 
the athletes he has coached 
upon their completion of their 
goals. Imhof ?rst picked up 
running in his middle school 
years as he didn’t see himself 
as a traditional team sport kid. 
Over the years, life has thrown 
him many curveballs and chal-
lenges that have forced him 
to take extended breaks from 
running. Coming back to the 
sport meant he had to face the 
weight he had put on and the 
?tness that he had lost. How-
ever, having always managed 
to get back on his feet (liter-
ally and metaphorically) every 
time tells us that Matt knows a 
thing or two about how to stay 
motivated through the thick 
and thin.
Imhof dispensed a lot of 
well-structured advice during 
his talk. His ?rst question was 
about the goal that everyone 
had in mind. Whether merely 
?nishing the marathon and 
having fun, or running it in a 
speci?c time, your goal will 
always determine your train-
ing. According to Imhof, “If 
you’re training for a time goal, 
every workout has a purpose. 
If you’re running for fun, well 
just make sure you have fun.”
With a goal in mind, Imhof 
advises runners to start 20-
26 weeks in advance (15-16 
weeks for a half marathon) 
to go from scratch to being 
able to run a marathon. He 
feels that this will give people 
a chance to let their bodies 
adjust to the strain of train-
ing and still get enough rest 
to recover. “The challenge is 
as important as the rest,” Im-
hof said when asked why he 
feels that runners shouldn’t 
run their everyday runs faster 
than their easy pace. “Some-
thing that most people don’t 
realize is that something that 
feels easy may not be physi-
ologically easy.”
The goal of your training is 
to strengthen your body from 
your bones to your muscles 
and glands. “Strengthening 
requires time,” Imhof said.
He stressed the importance 
of creating a game plan, stick-
ing to it, and reviewing it with 
the passage of time, in or-
der to adequately strengthen 
one’s body without straining 
it too much. The key factors 
in a workout plan that one 
can change are time/distance, 
pace, and frequency. Imhof is 
a strong believer in the 10% 
plan, a plan where a runner 
may increase his or her pace 
or distance by no more than 
10 percent each week with a 
down week every third week. 
When asked what running 
plans he recommends, Imhof 
advocated for Hal Higdon 
plans and the plans given by 
his company, Elite Runners.
Imhof revealed later in a 
personal interview that the 
reason he stresses on the im-
portance of goals stems from 
experiences he has had with 
running. “Running can make 
you sel?sh, and I was for a 
long time. I have learned that 
there is a better way. I need 
to enjoy it when I can and ac-
cept that my ?tness and per-
formance goals will have to be 
modi?ed at this time. I need to 
enjoy my boys and everything 
they bring to my life.”
Apart from setting goals 
and planning for them, Imhof 
stressed the importance of a 
support system, both physi-
cally and mentally. Imhof 
explained that this is the rea-
son he has a Sunday morning 
group. “Getting up on a cold 
Sunday morning to run 13 
miles every week is far less 
preferable than merely turn-
ing the snooze off and going 
back to sleep. If you know you 
have someone waiting out 
there to run with you, it makes 
it far harder for you to turn 
that snooze off.” 
Having three kids, how-
ever, Imhof likes his downtime 
and recognizes that runners 
need to balance their alone 
running time, their internal 
motivation, with group runs, 
their external motivation. He 
recommends that runners 
get their friends and family 
involved to help them reach 
their goals. He noted that his 
performance on race day has 
?uctuated based on how much 
support he got from his friends 
and family. Additionally, Im-
hof feels that 80 percent of 
being able to run a marathon 
is between one’s ears and only 
the remaining 20 percent is 
reliant on physical ?tness. 
Having a positive mindset and 
keeping oneself driven are key 
to being able to run a good 
marathon. Equally important 
is being able to think while 
you run and have a back up 
pace and goal, should the con-
ditions on race day be critical-
ly different from training con-
ditions. Imhof says that one 
must be willing to change and 
let go of the ego that comes 
from having trained so hard.
Physical support includes 
everything from the right ap-
parel to the appropriate nutri-
tion and even running form. 
Running 26 miles takes a long 
time. No one wants to go a 
long time in shoes that are un-
comfortable or aren’t suited to 
their feet. No one wants to feel 
cold, itchy, wet or in?exible for 
that time span either. “Take 
the time and money to invest 
in good running gear. Acquire 
some running fuel such as 
goo, Gatorade or even Power 
Bars and test your body’s re-
sponse to them before running 
the marathon,” said Imhof. 
Repeating a certain movement 
for a long expanse of time can 
have a grave toll on one’s body 
if one doesn’t make sure that 
one has the right form. Things 
to focus on according to Im-
hof are lean, cadence (foot 
strike rate), core, and arm 
movements. 
Imhof recommends profes-
sional help when it comes to 
the physical support section, 
as dealing with one’s body 
requires unique advice that 
should be given by someone 
with the relevant knowledge 
so that one may avoid injury 
and achieve one’s goals with 
comfort.
By focusing on all of the 
above things Imhof believes 
anyone can have a happy 
marathon and achieve their 
goals. All of the above points 
are equally important and no 
one factor can make up for 
another. Imhof’s ?nal com-
ments on running a marathon 
were: “You are out there run-
ning with 20,000 of your clos-
est friends. It is a great social 
experience and provides a lot 
of motivation. Take in what’s 
around you and enjoy what 
you are doing.”
Sports communities must change to include LGBTQ+ fans
There’s nothing inherent 
about sports that should ex-
clude people from watching, 
based solely on their sexuality. 
It’s not a sexual experience, 
and positing such a thing is 
enough to send most athletes 
and fans alike into an involun-
tary cringe. Being gay makes 
no sense as a factor in whether 
or not one becomes a sports 
fan, yet the big four Ameri-
can sports remain one of the 
few major cultural institutions 
barely touched by LGBTQ+ 
movements in the past de-
cade. There have been several 
instances that should be en-
couraging, but the reaction to 
each within sports communi-
ties has been uninviting.
The catch-all solutions pro-
posed by the NBA (heavy ?nes 
on the f-slur) and the NFL 
(“We have a gay man!’) are ex-
actly the sort of measures that 
have a two-pronged effect: 
they cover the nuances of how 
these issues affect real people 
and they bring queer bodies to 
light in a negative fashion, as 
the targets of discrimination 
and easy to brush off. Rather 
than trying to push a solution 
from the top down, it is best to 
examine the problem as it is. 
This problem is the erasure of 
queerness in the fan bases of 
the leagues. This leaves little 
incentive for the league to 
open its doors to people who 
identify as LGBTQ+.
Super Bowl weekend is so 
devoid of stories we’re talking 
about Tom Brady’s de?ated 
balls, so now seems as good a 
time as ever to try and under-
stand why it is so hard for a 
queer person to ?t into sports 
culture.
One problem is a matter of 
political demographics. Places 
with very high value for their 
local sports teams tend to be 
very conservative as well. 
There is not really a reason for 
this, it just happens to be true. 
Whether athletes ?ll the clas-
sic All-American archetype 
or people in low population 
density (and therefore, most 
likely conservative) areas just 
get bored, it’s a fact of sports. 
Much of the talent is generat-
ed in ultraconservative pock-
ets of America, and much of 
the money comes from people 
who came out of these places 
and became wealthy and gave 
back because they grew up 
with sports.
Former Red Sox out?elder 
Gabe Kapler once famously 
was the only non-self-de-
scribed Republican in a survey 
of the Red Sox. This has two 
effects on sports. The ?rst is 
that being openly gay is often 
considered immodest, self-in-
dulgent, or some other version 
of arrogant, and such players 
are often felt to be distrac-
tions. Just spend ?ve minutes 
in some locker rooms, and you 
will have heard every disgust-
ing and detailed heterosexual 
act you ever wanted to hear, 
but if someone drops the g-
bomb, they went too far. A lot 
of conservative culture — and 
by extension sports culture — 
insists that gay people should 
get over themselves and stop 
being so loud about it. Caus-
ing further damage are the in-
credibly public and seemingly 
obligatory religious displays 
that are often part of the dia-
logue surrounding pro sports.
It feels as if every ath-
lete thanks some sort of de-
ity every time they score a 
point, and every deity they 
pray to condemns being gay. 
The consistent and direct ac-
knowledgment of something 
that has been used to devalue 
queer bodies so publicly and 
loudly in society is off-putting 
to many gay fans. These two 
layers of the pipeline to pro 
sports make being gay seem 
like a permanent roadblock 
to true acceptance. Much of 
the discourse surrounding 
Michael Sam con?rmed this. 
While he did not necessar-
ily have the physical skills to 
succeed in the NFL, his be-
ing consistently referred to in 
chat forums as a “distraction” 
along with people openly hop-
ing he wouldn’t bring his “me-
dia circus” to their teams was 
a reminder that the pro sports 
fraternity house is coated in 
rainbow Te?on. It will never 
let a gay man truly stick.
There are also issues with 
simply the viewing experi-
ence of sports as a gay man. 
There are three kinds of ad-
vertisements that play dur-
ing a sporting event: ones for 
making your d*** work, ones 
for other sports, and ones fea-
turing scantily clad women 
selling alcohol, soap, or some 
other thing you don’t need 
scantily clad women in order 
to enjoy (read: everything). 
Live sporting events are DVR-
proof, as you lose the excite-
ment by seeing them late: you 
already know what will hap-
pen. This forces you to watch 
as the TV tells you that your 
life after you get up from the 
TV will involve either women 
or ?xing your defective body 
to be more attractive to wom-
en. It’s hard not to feel rejected 
when such a deep and com-
mon personal preference has 
been erased from the viewer-
ship or ignored entirely by TV 
executives.
To make things worse, the 
way athletes are characterized 
in the mainstream is often 
upsetting. Players are often 
shown talking to their wives 
and girlfriends after games, 
and while there is nothing 
wrong with that, it can hurt 
to never see the couple you 
dream of while watching. It’s 
not like on a TV show, where 
gay characters are forgotten by 
insensitive writers or erased 
via a storyboarding trope some 
exec learned in ?lm school. 
You’re witnessing a sample 
of over 20,000 people and, 
since the retirement of Jason 
Collins, not one is openly gay. 
Factor in the media character-
ization of many of these play-
ers and it can feel necessary to 
relate to them. However, when 
your feelings of love have such 
a dissonant impact from the 
players you see on TV, the me-
dia characterization of them 
as “everymen” but bigger is 
highlighting what you’ve been 
told makes you abnormal your 
whole life.
There are ways these prob-
lems are improving. While 
we are a long way from truly 
changing the underlying cul-
ture of sports, several recent 
advents have changed the way 
we can view and relate to what 
we’re seeing with sports me-
dia. The analytics movement 
in sports seems to have added 
a much stronger liberal con-
tingent to sports fandom and 
also focuses less on players’ 
personalities. It is no longer 
trying to have us conceptual-
ize these people as we relate 
to them. Now we have a set of 
data by which we can tell how 
they will perform as a player. 
While this seems unimportant, 
it changes sports from a drama 
where someone is watching a 
cast of characters to a sporting 
event where people are watch-
ing athletes. It makes the dis-
course surrounding player 
personalities and actions un-
important, and distances a fan 
from the parts of sports cul-
ture that can feel homophobic. 
It’s a minor step, but certainly 
a positive one. Campaigns to 
tackle homophobia, while by 
and large unsuccessful and 
met with backlash from bigots 
in sports communities, inspire 
hope and prove that there 
might be some will to change. 
However, as the landscape is 
now, the domain of sports is a 
straight man’s club. Pretend-
ing these things do not mean 
anything to me, let alone hurt 
me, I listen to those around me 
criminalize not just my sexual-
ity, but devalue my body as a 
person and man. I’m consis-
tently forced to listen to how 
uninvited I am, the listener 
oblivious to how this comes 
off to me. Sports are sup-
posed to be a fun, communal 
experience that everyone can 
get drunk and yell about, but 
hopefully, within next decade, 
those yells won’t be directed at 
me.

Russian repertoire enchants audience
Pittsburgh Symphony brings pizzazz to works by Russian composers
The Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra had a concert 
on Friday Jan. 30th. The concert, conducted by 
Krysztof Urbanski, was held at the ever opulent 
Heinz Hall. If you’ve never been, I would greatly 
encourage going to a symphony just for the 
ambiance of the Hall. The auditorium is beautifully 
lit, with impressive chandeliers adorning the 
ceiling in an arrangement that is reminiscent 
of a necklace. The stage itself is surrounded by 
impressive, modern-looking auditory buffers and 
wood paneling, and the wall-to-floor red velvet 
carpeting completes the experience, making a 
potential viewer feel like he stepped into an old 
European opera house. The concert itself opened 
with “Russian Overture,” a piece composed by 
Sergei Prokofiev. The piece started out with simple 
call and response melodies and never extended its 
reach to elicit any emotion from the viewer in its 
relatively brief 14-minute runtime.
The second piece was the highlight of the show, 
due in no small part to soloist Noah Bendix-Balgley, 
a violinist of international quality who is soon going 
to be Berlin Philharmonic’s concertmaster. The 
piece, Concerto for Violin and Orchestra by Aram 
Khachutarian, featured Balgley, who lent immense 
emotional gravitas to the solo parts. The Concerto’s 
opening movement is performed in the traditional 
sonata form, with two contrasting themes and a 
full development section. After a brief introductory 
outburst by the orchestra, Balgley presents an 
animated motif that soon evolves into a bounding, 
close-interval folk dance. This theme, punctuated 
once by the strong orchestral chords from the 
introduction, continues for some time before it 
gives way to a lyrical complementary strain of 
nostalgic emotional character. As the movement 
unfolds, the soloist is required to display one 
dazzling technical feat after another, culminating 
in a huge cadenza that serves as the bridge to the 
recapitulation. The finale is a whirling showpiece 
for Balgley that evokes the energetic world of jazz 
as Balgley’s violin playing drops in with blazing 
orchestral color.
The final piece, “Pictures at an Exhibition” was 
composed by Modest Mussorgsky. The piece is 
composed of ten different sections. According to 
Mussorgsky, the first section, called Promenade, 
depicts the composer roving through the exhibition 
“now leisurely, now briskly, and at times sadly, 
thinking of his friend.” The piece’s opening act is 
a mixture of triumph and quiet introspection. The 
soloist Bagley calls forth the feeling of matchless 
beauty and sacred enchantment during this part. 
The middle section is fairly standard material, 
and then the piece ends in an epic orchestral 
movement, with booming brass and swelling 
score. If anything, I would recommend one see the 
orchestra simply for the soloist, whose masterful 
playing creates emotional depth throughout the 
three pieces.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
My boyfriend has started 
sleeping over more often, 
which is great. What’s not 
so great, though, is that 
I don’t think it’s because 
we’re becoming closer. 
We’ve been fighting more 
about the littlest things, 
and he’s started having 
dinner with his friends 
most of the time instead 
of me.
I think it’s because of the 
walrus. My mom gave me 
this huge stuffed animal 
walrus when I left for 
college, and a few weeks 
ago I took it out of my 
storage bin and put it next 
to my desk facing the 
window, so that it could 
survey the outdoors.
My boyfriend’s taken to 
bringing it to bed with us, 
then nestling up close to 
it. Every time I try to get 
close so we can snuggle, 
he just snores loudly (I 
know he’s faking) and 
grinds up against Edgar, 
the walrus.
I’m afraid that I’m losing 
my boyfriend to my giant 
stuffed walrus. What do I 
do to win him back?
Heartbreakingly,
Old Days Of Bonding 
Escape my Newest 
Understanding, Seems 
he’d Rather Ordinarily 
Sport with My Animal, 
Really Upsetting my Soul
Dear ODOBENUS 
ROSMARUS,
How lifelike is this walrus? If 
Edgar is a cute, plushie-fied 
version of the actual beast, 
then you lost the war the 
minute you took the walrus 
out of the box. Not even 
Olivia Wilde could compete 
with a cute version of a giant 
sack of blubber and flesh. 
If it’s pretty lifelike, however, 
you have some options.
The simplest answer would 
have you hide or trash the 
walrus, but I’d imagine 
that’s equivalent to making a 
heroin addict go cold turkey: 
You’d be sure to suffer 
some major consequences 
somehow. You’d have to 
hide all your other stuffed 
animals, too, so that he 
doesn’t find a substitute — 
or tear them to shreds.
Probably the best option 
is to break your bank 
account and go to couple’s 
counseling — and bring 
Edgar with you.
If their relationship has 
gotten to the point where 
they’re taking moonlit walks 
through the park together, 
then you’ve got no chance. 
Might as well find yourself a 
nice plushie sloth.
Or a psychotherapist,
Evan Kahn

Outside The Frame Gallery on Friday night, blue and 
red lights ?ashed like police sirens from a front window 
onto the corner of Margaret Morrison Street and Forbes 
Avenue, where people rushing to get out of the cold 
were illuminated momentarily. Black screens covered 
the windows of the gallery, preventing onlookers from 
seeing inside. The title of the show, Blackout, a dramatic 
concept, emphasizes the powerful and drastic nature of 
the artwork inside The Frame.
The exhibit, curated by sophomore art majors Maya 
Kaisth and Jarel Grant, is part of the annual celebration 
of Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. M. Shernell Smith, 
assistant director of Blackout, coordinator of campus 
MLK Day events, and housefellow for The Intersection, 
worked in collaboration with The Frame co-directors 
Jamie Earnest and Emily Miller to bring art addressing 
national social and racial discrimination to the 
gallery. “We have the MLK writing awards, which are 
wonderful, but I really felt as if there was a creative 
element missing,” Smith said of the MLK celebrations. 
In November, after approaching Earnest and Miller at 
The Frame, the three issued a call asking for individuals 
interested in curating a show dealing with the topics of 
racial and social injustices.
When approaching topics such as these it is important 
to remember the scope of the conversation. Carnegie 
Mellon’s celebration of Dr. King’s legacy has examined 
local, national, and international inequalities. As a 
globally recognized university, Carnegie Mellon has a 
unique role in shaping the dialogue surrounding issues 
of injustice and ignorance across national borders. 
However, Smith thought it was important to have a 
space for members of the campus community to respond 
to the recent events in Ferguson and New York as well 
as create art in response to the day-to-day experiences 
of living and growing up in this country. “We needed a 
space that allowed us to have a national conversation 
about injustices, period,” Smith said. And Blackout does 
just that. Every piece is provocative and illustrates the 
nuances in everybody’s experiences within America’s 
cultural and racial framework.
Maya Kaisth, one of the curators, decided to apply to 
take on the project when she attended a student-led 
protest at Schenley Plaza with Jarel Grant. Kaisth felt 
passionately that she “didn’t want to glaze over any of 
the hard topics brought to light by current events.” Both 
she and Jarel contributed to the exhibition. Kaisth’s 
piece uses the screens that prevent people on the 
street from seeing inside the gallery. On the sides of the 
sheets facing inward, Kaisth projected recent trending 
hashtags, such as “#icantbreathe,” as well as hashtags 
dealing with similar subject matter from a couple years 
ago, such as “#trayvonmartin.” Occasionally obscured by 
individuals passing in front of the projector, the ?ashing 
of these hashtags across the screen is an ever-present 
reminder of the gravity and relevance of these issues 
today. “I wanted to make a piece that was integral to 
Blackout and showed the importance of new media and 
social media in framing the movement,” Kaisth said.
When Kaisth and Grant sent out a call to artists, they 
received responses from non-majors, majors, and faculty 
alike. The media range from drawings to sculpture to 
video art.
Some of the art in the exhibition uses text to make a 
powerful statement. BHA junior Jacqueline Barnes’ 
piece “Betoken me,” is an illustrated narrative of her life 
accompanied by text. Each piece in the series shows 
how she has felt throughout her life, and talks about 
the power of her art to communicate her experiences. 
Phrases like “so I dreamed when I 
could not breathe, making a mold 
where none would ?t me,” are 
incredibly powerful.
Junior art major Heather Cowie used 
her experiences on the popular app 
Tinder to create her piece “Me so 
lucky.” Cowie took the racial slurs and 
demeaning phrases that had been 
directed at her as an Asian woman by 
people on Tinder, and wrote them out on slips of paper 
like the kind found in fortune cookies. Fortune cookies 
and the “fortunes” stand on a small pedestal and gallery 
goers are encouraged to pick them up and read them.
Junior music performance major Nehemiah Russell’s 
piece “Civil War” included the text “with liberty and 
justice for all” in front of an illustration of a man’s face 
and shoulders divided down the center. The left side of 
the man’s face is a policeman, and the right side is an 
African-American man. The word “civil” falls on the side 
with the policeman, and the word “war” falls on the side 
opposite. The juxtaposition in color and identity of the 
two sides of the man is powerful and painfully truthful.
The rest of the pieces in the show are just as fascinating 
and important. “Wanting to be left alone,” a video art 
piece by sophomore art major Clair Chin, shows the 
artist white washing herself with derogatory words and 
phrases written on her skin. “Will Horton,” associate 
professor of art Andrew Johnson’s piece, is a drawing 
of Will Horton created from shoe polish used on top 
of sewn together ?ags that have been white washed. 
Walking through the exhibit brings so many questions 
and unique experiences to light. And that, after all, 
is the point of art — to make people think about their 
experiences and others’ and seek to learn more.
Smith hopes that exhibitions similar to Blackout can be 
done in future years in connection with MLK events. 
This year’s celebrations in honor of Dr. King have been 
emphasizing the importance of continuing a dialogue. 
Art is a way to get students out from behind their 
computer to go look at what experiences are like for 
those in their community. That is a different kind of 
engagement in a movement, one that relies less on 
acknowledging articles on Facebook in passing, and 
one that relies more on person-to-person interaction 
and understanding others’ lives and experiences. 
That is engagement, and Blackout certainly explores 
perspectives and experiences that are eye opening 
and essential to our understanding if we ever hope to 
achieve equality.
Blackout is on view at The Frame until Feb. 20.

Tales from Abroad: the beautiful Alhambra
A fascinating exploration of Spanish military lifestyle and culture
I’ve always loved the physical signs of history. I 
love that the rushing tide of human life has carved 
its structures and swirls into the world. One of the 
reasons I chose to study abroad in Granada, Spain 
this semester was that Spain’s unique history of 
interaction between Muslim, Christian, and Jewish 
cultures permeates the city. A prominent example of 
this exchange is the Alhambra.
The Alhambra is a mix between palace and military 
fortress. Originally a military base, the Alhambra 
was built in the 9th century on Sabika Hill, right 
on the banks of the Darro River. The complex 
commands a strategically excellent view of the 
countryside and the city. In the 13th century, 
Mohammad I renovated the fortress, decorating 
it with religious and cultural artwork, and adding 
a water system that still works today. In 1492, 
the Catholic monarchs Ferdinand and Isabella 
conquered Granada. The Alhambra remained an 
important palace for Spanish royalty until it was 
abandoned during the 18th century. 
All of this history adds up: the Alhambra is very old, 
very big, and completely beautiful. The outer walls 
of the complex are visible from all over the city, and 
are made of a reddish clay particular to this area of 
Spain. At night, when the Alhambra is illuminated, 
the walls shine a deep red-orange color. My two 
favorite aspects of the Alhambra are the Islamic 
decorations and the view from the walls. Arabic 
script figures prominently in the adornment of the 
buildings. Poems ring entire rooms, and variants 
on “Allah is the Lord” appear over and over again, 
carved into the white and cream marble that so many 
of the inner walls are made of. Carving words into the 
walls instead of painting them or hanging tapestries 
holds a certain beautiful simplicity. To me, the words 
look like decoration, but to someone who can read 
Arabic, they communicate a constant reaffirmation of 
faith. I love the idea that the assertion of belief is all 
the decoration that a palace needs.
The other part of visiting the Alhambra that I loved 
was the view from the walls. It seems clichéd — I 
liked the view — but rather I liked the way I could 
see a kind of history stretching out before me. 
American cities were designed with trade in mind; 
most major population centers revolve around rivers 
and potential ports, without the same clear need to 
protect and defend. While early American invaders 
had bloody conflicts with Native Americans, the 
threat of attack did not exist on the constant scale 
and level that many European cities experienced. 
From the walls, I could see that the fortress and the 
city were built with invasion and defense in mind. 
The Darro River and the mountains protect the city, 
and from the Alhambra, you can see for miles. From 
a military standpoint, visibility is key. Up on the 
walls, I felt like I could see the needs and the fears of 
the past so clearly.

Carnegie Mellon’s a campus known for embracing 
quirkiness, but some of us still have appearances to 
maintain — not all of us want to be upfront about our 
appreciation of anime, and in my case it’s usually 
pretty easy. Generally, I’m not impressed by the bulk 
of Japanese broadcast animation; they tend to strike 
me as kind of trope-y and formulaic. Even if there are 
interesting designs or story ?ourishes, another show 
about the machinations of a student council or the 
passion-based ?ghting style of a cyborg is something I 
can’t put up with for too long.
So that’s why I’m so glad that something like Jojo’s 
Bizarre Adventure exists.
While there are older animated adaptations of the 
acclaimed manga by Hirohiko Araki, the latest run is 
jam-packed with visual charm and a great sense of style. 
Heavily stylized openings accompanied by delightfully 
hokey original compositions embrace the over-the-top 
attitude of the series show with arresting color palettes 
and some impressively detailed character animation that 
might just be CGI, but looks like nothing else.
It’s an indicator of what happens visually during the 
show as well. Every character in this show is built like a 
Greek statue, and there’s a goofy tendency for them to 
strike body-building poses when they deliver important 
lines. In scenes of heightened peril or emotion it’s not 
uncommon for the colors to shift shades enough that 
everything gets purple overtones or, in the case of the 
most recent episode, a villain is shown in shades of 
green as he stalks one of the heroes.
The series tells the story of a multi-generational struggle 
between the Joestar family and the immortal Dio. A 
deliciously evil and eminently quotable villain, Dio is 
transformed by an ancient stone mask from a malicious 
London street urchin out of an Austen novel into a 
bloodthirsty vampire. He partners up with the likes of 
Jack the Ripper and builds an army of the undead in a 
small British village.
The only one who can stop him is perfect gentleman 
Jonathan Joestar (called Jojo, as is the protagonist 
of every subsequent season). He’s taught an ancient 
martial art by an Italian baron named Zeppeli that allows 
him to “imbue his punches with sunlight.” Joined by 
Robert E. O. Speedwagon, he confronts the vampire and 
manages to seal him away.
Oh, did I mention that most every character in the show 
is named after an American musician or song from the 
‘80s or ‘90s? Because there is literally a character named 
ACDC. He’s a bad guy from the second story arc. In 
this arc, Jonathan’s grandson, Joseph, is traveling the 
world to ?ght the ancient civilization of incredibly buff 
men who created the mask that transformed Dio. He 
teams up with a Nazi cyborg and a few other outrageous 
?ghters to defeat this new threat, culminating in a ?ght 
inside an active volcano off the coast of Italy.
The current season is about Joseph and his stoic, tough-
guy, half-Japanese grandson ?ghting their way across 
southern Asia alongside a serious Egyptian fortune teller, 
a manic French duelist, and another Japanese high 
schooler who likes to hang out poolside... in his school 
uniform. They’re trying to reach 
Cairo after Dio re-emerges, but 
this time, instead of using ancient 
martial arts, everybody gets a 
physical manifestation of their force 
of will called a “stand.”
The ?ghting in the later seasons 
becomes a little faster paced, 
and while there’s still has a lot 
of exposition about attacks and 
powers, things are kept fresh and 
visually interesting, and ?ghts don’t 
usually last longer than an episode. 
It’s somewhat offset by a number of 
long narrations about some of the 
exotic locales visited by the group, 
explaining local customs or tourist 
attractions.
Jojo’s Bizarre Adventure is a completely ridiculous and 
utterly fun watch that either bucks the trends of a lot 
of anime or embraces them so wholeheartedly that 
they seem interesting again. If you’re looking for 75+ 
episodes of something to watch that looks good and 
is unabashedly silly in a way that’ll recapture some of 
the joy of your ?rst exposure to “Japanimation,” look no 
further.

For someone searching for the ever-out-of-reach 
answer to the meaning of life, The Theory of 
Everything may prove a stepping stone in the eternal 
quest. Yet for entertainment it certainly falls flat. 
Do not go into The Theory of Everything looking for 
a good story, and if you can help it, go in knowing 
nothing at all about Stephen Hawking. Reading the 
Wikipedia page on Dr. Hawking’s life, at least in my 
estimation, essentially makes any element of plot a 
moot point.
A lack of plot or entertainment seems like the 
ultimate curse for a film, the basic description of a 
flop. It would certainly be hard to argue that The 
Theory of Everything is one such flop in the wake 
of the film’s many Oscar nominations. It is currently 
nominated for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, 
Best Adapted Screen Play, and Best Original Score. 
The film tells the story of the legendary Professor 
Stephen Hawking, played by Eddie Redmayne, 
starting from his days as a Ph.D. student in physics 
at the University of Cambridge, to the release of 
his seminal book, A Brief History of Time. Far from 
focusing on Dr. Hawking’s professional life, much 
of the film centers around the blossom and decay of 
his relationship with his first wife Jane, played by 
Felicity Jones, while simultaneously dealing with the 
progression of his motor neuron disease. And if that 
wasn’t enough material to cover in the film, throw in 
friends, a choirmaster, a nurse, three children, and 
the rest of Hawking’s family. Indeed, the film leaves 
one feeling a bit whiplashed, never quite focusing on 
one subject long enough to get any real depth.
That is not to say that the film lacks emotion. In 
fact, the emotions it can elicit might be the most 
redeeming quality of the film and what showcase 
it as a piece of art. The characters are complex and 
rich, and played with extraordinary skill and subtlety. 
They leave you broken hearted one moment, the next 
laughing, and finally screaming at the screen for their 
insanity. One such outburst this author experienced 
was, “The man can barely eat and you’re having a 
third child with him? COME ON. BE REASONABLE!” 
And yet it is exactly these complex questions that 
make the film a great exploration of the human 
experience.
Jones and Redmayne deliver through the ?lm’s 
emotional highs and lows; Felicity Jones deeply 
engages the audience. As the ?lm progresses, even her 
most blank look conveys the internal struggle and pain 
that Jane is experiencing caring for a disabled husband 
and three young children. Her portrayal is matched 
by Redmayne who, though con?ned to a wheelchair 
for most of the ?lm, is able to portray the depth of a 
complex (and surprisingly funny) man. But something 
is missing; in some way or another, the audience’s 
understanding of the characters feels hindered. If only 
the actors had some dialogue ...
Looking back on the film overall, one of the most 
amazing things was how little dialogue there was. 
Perhaps it was a commentary on the reserve of the 
English, but the dialogue is so sparse it is hard to 
believe that these people know each other at all. 
The lack of dialogue leaves the beginning of the film 
seeming almost ludicrous, because in the span of 
three meaningful glances Stephen and Jane have 
gone from just meeting to dealing with his motor 
neuron disease and getting married. Such a ridiculous 
plot jump has not been seen since Princess Anna and 
Prince Hans, of Frozen fame, got engaged.
On the other hand, from the standpoint of the 
filmmaking craft, The Theory of Everything is 
beautifully rich. The director, James Marsh, has 
a definite affinity for motifs, as they spring up 
throughout the movie, providing an interesting 
binding thread. The costuming is also a rather 
ingenious mechanism of character development. 
One watches rather helplessly as the flowing, young, 
dreamy dresses of young Jane morph into the old and 
frumpy. It is these details that help give the film its 
artistic quality.
Though containing too many themes, characters, 
and subject matters to truly deal with any of them, 
The Theory of Everything provides a sharp look at 
the meaning of life. It may be totally wrong for a 
movie night with friends, but perhaps it is a crucial 
piece of cinema. Be sure to watch it during your next 
existential crisis.

Thursday nights are Shonda Nights. No questions 
asked. Last winter left Shonda Rhimes’ fans with three 
nail biting mid-season ?nales on her hit shows Grey’s 
Anatomy, Scandal, and the newbest addition to the 
line-up, How To Get Away with Murder. And this past 
Thursday marked the highly anticipated return of all 
three. Ever since 2012 when her hit series Scandal 
premiered immediately following her longtime success 
Grey’s Anatomy, Shonda Rhimes — screenwriter, 
director, and producer — has scheduled a place in 
millions of viewers’ weeks with hours of Thursday night 
delight.
I’m a newbie to the tradition, hopelessly hooked to 
Shonda Night’s newest addition, How To Get Away 
with Murder, written by Pete Nowalk and produced 
by Rhimes, which ?rst aired last September. The 
show follows Annalise Keating, a sharp, brilliant, 
and mysterious law professor, and her ?ve protégés 
(affectionally dubbed “The Keating Five.”) The characters 
work on criminal defense cases weekly, meanwhile 
unraveling a murder they are all somehow connected 
to over the course of this season’s episodes. While I 
recognize that this drama may sound like any other court 
show, watching just one episode will show you why it’s 
not.
Every Thursday when I tune in, I get goose bumps when 
Oscar-nominated actress Viola Davis steps into the role 
of Annalise Keating, a character I’ve never seen the 
likes of on television before. Annalise is an incredibly 
powerful and respected lawyer who presents herself as 
a strong, self-assured professional, doing everything 
she can to ?ght for those who are innocent. In the very 
?rst episode, she commands a college lecture hall as she 
proudly marches down to the front of the blackboard and 
introduces her class to “Criminal Defense 101” or as she 
likes to call it, “How to Get Away with Murder”. In that 
tension ?lled moment, I remember sitting on the couch 
and holding my breath until her sly smile and bright 
eyes gave me permission to breathe again. In every 
scene of every episode, Annalise exudes con?dence from 
the classroom to the courtroom, which is exactly what 
her clients need as she saves them from punishments 
ranging from imprisonment to death. In one case when 
she has the chance to save a wrongfully accused client 
from time on death row, she delivers an impassioned 
speech, almost getting thrown out of the courtroom, 
which ultimately brings a powerful senator to his knees. 
After she wins that case, her law student, Michaela Pratt, 
(played by Aja Maomi King) speaks for us all when she 
says, “I wanna be her”.
But one-dimensional characters aren’t fun, so behind 
the con?dent brilliance viewers also get a glimpse of 
the other Annalise, a woman who is scared, plagued 
by betrayal, mistrust, and dishonesty behind the doors 
of Keating and Associates. In a much-buzzed-about 
scene, after an exhausting court case, we see Annalise 
physically stripping down her powerful image as she 
removes makeup, eyelashes, and her wig and looks into 
the mirror to see her natural self. I couldn’t imagine 
such a powerful moment with any other actress in the 
“I woke up like this” era of television. Her vulnerability 
serves as a refreshing look to see a complex character; a 
woman struggling with her marriage, struggling with her 
morality, and struggling with herself.
Shortly after the show premiered, New York Times TV 
Critic Alessandra Stanley wrote about how Shonda 
Rhimes’ productions, referred to as Shondaland, have 
created a generation of African-American women who 
are “authority ?gures with sharp minds and potent 
libidos who are respected,” unlike the many “sassy 
sidekick” roles African-American actors and actresses 
are often reduced to. Viola Davis has risen to fame 
in many of these supporting roles, winning an Oscar 
nomination for 8 minutes of screen time in the ?lm Doubt. 
But Davis describes herself as the type of individual who 
works hard no matter the number of pages in the script 
she’s given. And so far, we’ve seen this; she doesn’t 
waste a single second during the show.
My obsession with “How To Get Away With Murder“ 
hasn’t ended with Thursday nights. Both Shonda Rhimes 
and Viola Davis are incredibly successful women and 
have incredibly valuable lessons to share. If you missed 
Rhimes’ commencement speech last year at her alma 
mater Dartmouth College, you’re missing out. She speaks 
honestly and openly about the differences between 
dreamers and doers, criticizing our generation for our 
focus on hashtag activism. She tells young people that 
we need to recognize the difference between wishing 
and doing, pushing for us to take action on the latter. 
At one point she is hilariously straightforward when she 
says, “So you think, ‘I wish I could travel.’ Great. Sell your 
crappy car, buy a ticket to Bangkok, and go. Right now. 
I’m serious.” And, speaking simply and openly, you and I 
both know that she’s absolutely right.
I keep these lessons close to my heart and am grateful 
that I live in a time and place where I can look up to see 
these incredible women doing amazing work and being 
recognized and celebrated for it. I get to learn lessons 
about success and failure, hard work and humility, 
complexity, and morality from women who have an 
incredible gift and power. That’s why Thursday nights 
mean so much to me. And if you’d like to join in, I’ll save 
some room on the couch.

Childhood mandolin prodigy Chris Thile continues to 
wow listeners with his virtuosity at age 33. Thile made 
a name for himself with the progressive acoustic band 
Nickel Creek in 1989, and since their dissolution has 
become a popular collaborator due to his undeniable 
talent and genre crossover ability. In 2006, Chris Thile 
formed The Punch Brothers, then called How to Grow a 
Band, and cut their ?rst album How to Grow a Woman 
from the Ground.
Since 2006 The Punch Brothers have released four 
additional albums, the most recent of which is 
Phosphorescent Blues, released this week. Straddling 
bluegrass, alternative rock, and classical genres, the 
band focused on various areas for each of their past 
albums and projects. Coming off of the success of their 
last studio album Who’s Feeling Young Now, the band 
had a lot to live up to, giving their fans some of the same 
kinds of music while continuing to explore their sound. 
As a result, fans have had very speci?c criticisms of this 
most recent album depending on the genre they would 
like the band to lean toward.
The band, made up of frontman singer and mandolin 
player Chris Thile, violinist Gabe Witcher, guitarist Chris 
Eldridge, banjo player Noam Pikelny, and bassist Paul 
Kowert, all contribute their prodigal skill in complex and 
virtuosic musical demonstrations during each number 
(each band member also lends additional vocals.) 
Phosphorescent Blues is no exception. On the song “My 
Oh My,” Pikelny’s quick banjo licks make the rhythmic 
nature of the song fun and exciting. “My Oh My,” a single 
from the album, is inarguably the catchiest song and one 
that is the most reminiscent of the lyric-driven, harmony-
?lled, and chorus-oriented numbers from Who’s Feeling 
Young Now.
However, “My Oh My” is one of the only satisfying 
moments from the album for those looking for more 
songs like favorites “Who’s Feeling Young Now” or “This 
Girl.” In general the tenor of this latest album is more 
laidback, with calmer, more soothing melodies that 
are more classically in?uenced. Indeed there are a few 
solely instrumental pieces including “Passepied,” an 
arrangement of Debussy. These classical interpretations 
are beautiful and certainly fascinating for lovers of 
Debussy and other composers listeners they may 
recognize. These pieces are similar to Thile’s earlier 
period of instrumental arrangements of classical pieces 
as well as his album Not All Who Wander are Lost. The 
removal of a vocal line allows the instrumentation to 
become even more textured than it is in some of the 
other numbers.
The majority of the numbers are more bluesy — as the 
title of the album would suggest. “Forgotten” is a melodic 
exploration of the lyrics and doesn’t adhere to the more 
traditional song structure of some of their earlier works.

While one might appreciate the avant-garde nature of 
such songs, some of them work and some of them get a 
little overwrought toward the end. “Between 1st and A” 
is such a song, where calm soothing humming over long 
expanses of strumming (though incredibly impressive), 
isn’t super thought-provoking or stimulating. “Julep,” 
another single from the record, is an example of when a 
rambling musical exploration works in a satisfying way. 
In addition, “Julep” lyrics such as “heaven’s a julep on 
the porch,” conjure up vivid imagery. The song moves 
forward to give listeners new material often enough to 
keep them entertained.
Thile and the band have obvious talent as songwriters 
and arrangers. Though they run the risk of being too 
noisy due to the prevalence of strummy and melodic 
acoustic instruments, arrangements are nuanced 
enough so that the banjo, guitar, mandolin, and violin 
combination never gets aurally overbearing. Lyrically the 
songs are interesting, having inspirations ranging from 
failed relationships to beautiful and wonderful days, and 
a lot of ground is covered.
Phosphorescent Blues is not a disappointment in the 
sense that The Punch Brothers have lost what makes 
them so special in the genre crossover world. But due 
to its combination of musical types: alternative rock 
pieces from albums like Who’s Feeling Young Now, 
experimental roaming bluegrass tunes, and instrumental 
arrangements of classical music, the album loses some of 
its coherence. Previous albums have had a more coherent 
musical sound, but this one leaves listeners feeling a 
little unsettled and confused. These complaints, however, 
are not enough to make a faithful Punch Brothers fan 
disheartened and it will be very exciting to see what 
these men do in the future.

10cupcakes
pillbox 02.02.15
This past week, one of my best friends from home texted 
me. Her boyfriend’s birthday is coming up next week, 
and she wants to make him cupcakes. Here’s where 
I come in: “Any suggestion on ?avor?” She obviously 
came to the right person, because the answer is yes — I 
always have ideas for cupcakes! In addition to being 
one of my greatest friends, she is also the busy mother 
of a beautiful 8-month-old baby boy. To give her a ?avor 
that isn’t going to take up a whole bunch of time, I’ve 
come up with a really fun idea that can be made almost 
entirely with store-bought ingredients: The ice cream 
cake cupcake.
You know those delicious ice cream cakes from Dairy 
Queen? Layers of chocolate and vanilla ice cream, 
separated by those little cookie crunchies that were 
really the only reason you loved the cake, then topped 
with a creamy whipped frosting. Now imagine all of that 
scrumptious nostalgia being reborn as a cupcake. The 
bottom layer, in lieu of ice cream, is a layer of chocolate 
cake, followed by the cookies, vanilla ice cream, then a 
perfect swirl of whipped cream, not complete without 
some rainbow sprinkles and a cherry on top — or a 
candle for the birthday boy! This can be as easy or as 
involved as you want it to be. If you’ve got all the time 
and resources in the world, you could make every single 
part from scratch. On the other hand, if you’re in a pinch 
or pinching pennies, each component can also come 
straight from the grocery store. I’m going to make just 
the cake from scratch, but buy the vanilla ice cream and 
whipped cream from the store. If you want to make ice 
cream or whipped cream at home, there are plenty of 
recipes on the web!
Cake
1 cups of sugar
7/8 cups of ?our (do your best estimation)
3/8 cup of cocoa powder
3/4 teaspoon of baking powder
3/4 teaspoon of baking soda
1/2 teaspoon of salt
1 eggs
1/2 cup of milk
1/4 cup of vegetable oil
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1/2 cup of boiling water
Cookie Crunchies
1 package of Oreos or Chocolate Wafers (but I 
recommend Oreos)
1 bottle of chocolate Magic Shell (that super exciting ice 
cream topping)
Vanilla ice cream
Whipped cream
Rainbow sprinkles or jimmies (I am tolerant of all 
language variations)
Maraschino cherries
Instructions
First things ?rst, preheat the oven to 350 degrees and 
put liners in two full cupcake trays, 24 cupcakes total. 
Measure out the sugar, ?our, cocoa powder, baking 
powder, baking soda, and salt into a large bowl. Then put 
in the eggs, milk, oil, and vanilla, and stir it all up. Really 
carefully, pour the hot water in. If you’re wondering why 
the water has to be hot, it’s because it really helps to 
bring out the ?avor of the chocolate, so no cheating! The 
mixture should be thin, so don’t worry, you didn’t do 
anything wrong. Put a generous spoonful into all of the 
liners and bake those for about 8 minutes.
While those are baking and cooling, start making the 
cookie layer. If you have Oreos you’ll have to separate 
each and every cookie from its cream ?lling. Even 
though it takes longer, at least you’ll get to eat all that 
Oreo ?lling! If you got chocolate wafers instead, try not to 
be too sad. After you have a ton of naked cookies, crush 
them using either a food processor or a zip-lock bag and 
a hammer-type object (excellent for stress relief). Don’t 
crush them into crumbs, but keep them in big enough 
chunks that they’ll be recognizable and crunchy. Pour 
them into a bowl with the whole bottle of magic shell 
and mix it all up. Before you keep going, make sure the 
cupcakes are cooled the whole way through so the entire 
thing doesn’t melt!
If you have time to soften the ice cream, that will be 
really helpful in binding all of the elements together. To 
assemble the cupcake, spoon enough crumblies to cover 
the cake, then put a scoop of vanilla ice cream on top 
of the cookie layer. When all 24 are done, put them in 
the freezer so it all sticks. Keep them in there until it’s 
time to serve, then swirl some whipped cream over the 
ice cream, followed by the sprinkles and, of course, the 
cherry on top!

---------------------------------------------------

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available 
to most upperclass students, except those in special-interest housing, a first-year 
dormitory, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in room selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a “block” 
of rooms near each other in one of the applicable dormitories. Students electing to 
apply for block housing must identify a group representative who will be responsible 
for setting up their block housing group on the housing application and will remain the 
main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
General room selection
General room selection is the final phase of room selection. During this phase, students 
eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose a room 
from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general room selection 
must apply online. They are then given a random timeslot for room selection.
Themed housing
Themed housing allows students to apply for housing centered around a certain 
interest or theme. Themed houses are detailed on page six of this guide.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2015–16 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in room 
selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Student Life.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing, available in the Oakland Community Apartments, permits 
upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2015-16 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the room selection process, visit  
www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), block housing, general 
room selection, themed housing, RA/CA housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three room selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. 
However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room selection begins on Feb. 15, so all students returning next year 
should be actively thinking about their housing plans for the 2015–16 school year.

What’s new for 2015 room selection and selection phases
Students in Greek Housing Eligible for Room Selection
Students living in Greek houses can now participate in room selection, including being 
pulled in, applying within a block, or going through general room selection. 
Previously, students living in Greek houses could not return to on-campus hous-
ing after moving into their organization’s house. If students in Greek houses plan to 
continue living in their respective houses, they must fill out an application separate 
from the room selection application to confirm their place in the house.
Shirley and Neville Apartments now Graduate Housing
Shirley and Neville Apartments will be available only to graduate students for the 
upcoming academic year. Previously, these houses were designated as upperclassmen 
houses. Carnegie Mellon’s Housing Services states on its website that the choice to 
make these locations graduate student housing is an effort to “create a more concen-
trated living experience for our graduate students.” Graduate students interested in 
these options will apply through a separate application. More information about the 
application will be coming soon, according to the website.

Living on campus vs. living off campus 
Questions to ask and tools to help you decide
Deciding whether or not you want to live on campus next year can be a tough decision. Both on-campus and 
off-campus living have their appeals, and the right option will almost definitely come down to each individual’s 
unique living needs.
Use the chart below to determine the costs of living off campus versus living on campus. The column on the 
right shows what is included in on-campus housing. Ask prospective landlords the cost of each of these items 
listed below and fill in the dollar amount next to the appropriate icon. For items or services that you do not 
believe are applicable to you, write 0 in the blank. Total all costs and compare to the cost of living on campus as 
you make your decision for next year. Chart provided by Housing Services.
Questions to ask when deciding where to live:
If you are considering moving off campus, be sure to ask 
these questions, provided by Housing Services, before you 
sign a lease:
Rent and Additional Costs
Is there an application or holding fee? If yes, what is the 
cost?
What utilities are included in the rent?
How much is the security deposit?
When is the rent due?
Leases
In case you plan to study abroad for part of the school year 
or summer, are variable lease options available (six, nine, or 
12 months)?
Is individual lease liability offered?
How many people is this unit legally zoned for?
In the city of Pittsburgh, it is illegal for more than three 
unrelated individuals to live together in a residential 
dwelling. 
Do you have a rental license on file with the city of 
Oakland?
Will I be able to sublet my unit in the summer or for study 
abroad?
Repairs and Maintenance
Will any repairs be made to the unit prior to move in?
How quickly do you make repairs when there is a work 
request or maintenance issue?
Do you take before and after pictures to help guarantee I get 
my security deposit back?
Amenities
What type of security does the building offer?
What type of parking is offered?
What appliances are provided, and how old are they?
Who is responsible for yard maintenance and snow 
removal?

NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODSHOUSING GUIDE
SQUIRREL HILL
Squirrel Hill starts just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue. It is either 
a 20-minute walk or a three-minute bus ride from campus, and the 
buses are very frequent — all of the 61 buses serve the route. The 
cost of living in Squirrel Hill is higher than in Oakland, but lower than in 
Shadyside. Furthermore, Squirrel Hill is the most residential of all the 
areas surrounding campus. In addition to housing upperclass students 
from Carnegie Mellon, it is also home to faculty and Pittsburgh families 
not associated with the university. Most Carnegie Mellon students 
know the neighborhood for its restaurants and Giant Eagle. Squirrel 
Hill has a diversity of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to 
breakfast at the original Pamela’s Diner. The restaurants are dispersed 
among small shops, including those on the main thoroughfare of Forbes 
Avenue.
On Murray Avenue, just off Forbes, Giant Eagle is the perfect one-
stop shop for all of your grocery shopping necessities. Squirrel Hill is 
relatively quiet, with most noise coming from traf?c on Forbes and 
Murray Avenues. It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland and 
Shadyside, and it does not have a prominent bar scene. It does have a 
residential atmosphere, however, that the other two areas lack. 
For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with all the 
necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of cuisines, 
Squirrel Hill may be the right place to look for a home to rent.

Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or ?ve-minute bus ride) from campus lies Oakland, the 
home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up 
almost entirely of college students. 
Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including 
Con?ict Kitchen, Chipotle, Fuel and Fuddle, and The Porch. For students over 21, 
Oakland has a solid group of late-night destinations, such as Hemingway’s, Mad 
Mex, and a liquor store with an extensive selection. Another bene?t of Oakland is 
the availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood 
Avenue are lined with housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh 
students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet 
neighborhood, Oakland may not be your cup of tea. Starting on Thursday nights — 
the start of the weekend for Pitt students — the neighborhood bustles, ?lled with 
groups of college kids out to have a good time. Oakland should be noted for its lively 
atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for college-oriented surroundings.
OAKLAND
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by bus, it 
tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of 
the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood 
is best known for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety 
of shops, from small boutiques to larger brands like Apple, J. Crew, and Banana Republic. 
Cozy restaurants like Mercurio’s and The Yard Gastropub are interspersed among the 
shops.
Just blocks from the restaurants are Shadyside’s bars. William Penn Tavern and Shady 
Grove are the most popular. William Penn Tavern in particular gathers a large number of 
Carnegie Mellon students.
While the area near these bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, Shadyside 
is generally a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college students 
who live there are diverse  — from artists to technical majors to medical students. 
Shadyside is a great area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a popular 
shopping and nightlife experience.
