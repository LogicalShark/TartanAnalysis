IN 2005 WE wrote 3400 essay pages of content • shot over 
33,100 photos • created over 300 works of art • became 
one of the 8 best newspapers in our class nationally • won 
3 national awards for content excellence
IN 2006 WE...
... accept the principal challenge of making 
this newspaper your newspaper.
In just two short years, The Tartan has 
lifted itself from relative obscurity to national 
prominence. But we are.far from the pinnacle 
of our performance. This is the beginning.
The media landscape is changing without 
pause, as technology allows content provid­
ers to be faster, more dynamic, and more 
responsive. There could be no better time to 
be in the newspaper industry. But across the 
country, college newspapers have yet to react;
they stand idle, relics of another age.
At The Tartan, we believe that college news­
papers can and must lead the way.
This year, as we celebrate our 100th birth­
day, we begin an ambitious project of re­
newal. Drawing upon the awe-inspiring inno­
vation of the Carnegie Mellon community, we 
aim to create a media organization capable of 
adapting to the ever-changing needs of our 
audience.
The Tartan is poised to deliver, so I invite 
you to expect the world from us. We have full
intentions of pushing the envelope on every 
front. We will find the stories that matter to 
you. We will bring more bright, beautiful im­
ages to your eyes. We will explore new medi­
ums for conveying information. We will bring 
down the barrier between paper and pixel. 
We will find new revenue sources to minimize 
our dependence on the student activities fee. 
We will transcend the mold of the traditional 
college newspaper.
This year, we will make this newspaper 
your newspaper.

Students share 
their stories from 
Lebanon and Israel
by Michael M. Whiston
Staffwriter
Tension between Israel and 
Hezbollah hit home for several 
Carnegie Mellon students this 
summer. From the bombings of 
Beirut to a boom in Tel Aviv’s 
business, students from Leba­
non and Israel expressed mixed 
perspectives of turmoil in their 
home countries. And for a 
couple of first-years, moving to 
college meant leaving close 
ones behind in a war-torn land.
Moving into his dormitory 
for the first time, first-year 
mechanical engineering major 
Charbel Eid parted from his 
home near Beirut, where he has 
lived his whole life. Eid’s family 
also moved during this time, 
but for a very different reason.
“We would hear everything, 
and the building would shake,” 
said Eid, speaking of the south­
ern Beirut bombings.
Fighting broke out between 
Hezbollah and Israel on July 12 
after Hezbollah took two Israeli 
soldiers captive and killed three 
others. Prior to the mid-August 
cease-fire, Israel bombed Leba­
nese infrastructure including 
Beruit International Airport, 
and Hezbollah launched sal­
vos of rockets across the Israeli 
border.
According to Eid, the noise 
from Israeli bombs became 
so bad that his family moved 
north to escape the blasts. How­
ever, bombings have stopped 
with the cease-fire, he said, and 
his family is now moving back 
home.
According to an August 18 
article in the Washington Post 
titled “U.N. Urges Europe to 
Join Mideast Effort; Western- 
Muslim Force Sought; Italy 
Offers Peacekeeping Troops,” 
Eid’s family members were 
just a few of the 4000 peo­
ple who traveled back to their 
Lebanese homes during this 
time. The Post described the 
cease-fire as a time for “many 
in Lebanon to carry out burials 
... in about 40 villages for more 
than 250 people killed during 
the war.”
First-year business major Guy 
Levit experienced the battle 
from the other side — when he 
came to college, he left behind 
his home in Tel Aviv. But for 
Levit, life remained largely the 
same as it was before the war, 
as much of the conflict occured 
away from his home.
“It doesn’t look as dramatic 
[in Tel Aviv] as it is in the 
north,” he said.
According to Levit, people 
still go to work and into the city. 
Businesses are doing well in 
Tel Aviv, as people from the 
north filter in to escape 
conflict.
“Life is pretty much 
normal,” he said.
Levit said that the hardest 
part for him personally was 
when a missile injured a fam­
ily friend. He said that he has 
friends in the north who work 
as engineers in shelters.
Francois R. Farjallah moved 
to Lebanon as an expatriate, re­
cently finishing coursework for 
his MBA in the Tepper School of 
Business. Farjallah lived in the 
city center of Beiruit.

New services benefit student life

Less work, more food. It sounds too 
good to be true, but it’s the direction in 
which most changes on campus are head­
ing this year. Among them, the introduc­
tion of the Carnegie Mellon ID+ card with 
its own dedicated office, the update of 
the career center TartanTrak website, and 
the addition of four new campus dining 
venues.
The new Carnegie Mellon Card Office, 
located in Warner Hall A15, brings to­
gether services that have previously 
been provided by two different areas on 
campus. According to CMU Card Office 
manager Josh Frederick, the new setting 
combines vendor services, which have in 
the past been provided by Housing and 
Dining Services, and student services, tra­
ditionally provided by The HUB.
“We wanted to make it more of a one- 
stop shop for issues regarding the card 
than we’ve had the capability to do in the 
past,” Frederick said.
The “plus factor” of the new card itself 
is that it can also be used as an ATM card 
for all students with PNC bank accounts. 
In addition, students will notice that their 
Port Authority bus pass is now branded 
on the card in the form of a bus icon, mak­
ing the traditional bus pass stickers, only 
valid for a semester at a time, a thing of 
the past.
All the features of the card that students 
have come to rely on are still valid, includ­
ing museum access, library loans, laundry 
service, printing quotas, copy machine ac­
cess, and PlaidCa$h. PlaidCa$h functions 
exactly as Campus Xpress has in the past: 
cash dollars in the form of an account on 
the card which allows students to pay for 
items anywhere on campus and at select 
off-campus venues.
“We changed the name in a re-branding 
effort to get people thinking about us­
ing Campus Xpress again in a new way,” 
Frederick said.
The overhaul of TartanTrak, Carnegie 
Mellon’s online job recruiting system, was 
born out of a similar effort to combine 
the efforts of several businesses into one. 
The biggest change to the site is that the 
service, formerly provided by online job- 
recruiting pioneer Monster.com, is now 
owned by the University itself.
“We lost confidence in Monster’s ability 
to provide us an efficient system,” said 
Paul Fowler, director of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Career Center.
Fowler explained that the new site al­
lows the school’s career counselors to 
keep notes on each student they are work­
ing with as data within the TartanTrak 
online system, instead of in an external 
file or program. By being able to keep all 
student data and career information in
one place, they have more control over 
issues of student confidentiality.
“[The site] is a more productive system 
for on-campus recruiting,” Fowler said. He 
added that he feels that Carnegie Mellon 
has created a “much more user-friendly 
system” than has been feasible in the 
past.
He noted that all resources that stu­
dents will need are featured on the site as 
of its opening last Friday, but that more 
available positions for this semester will 
be added daily.
The most extensive revamping has been 
within Dining Services. Within the next 
two weeks, four new dining venues will 
be available on campus for student use. 
Several pre-existing eateries will open to­
day with new hours, locations, and menu 
items.
“These new venues are a result of our

Carnegie Mellon named a “new Ivy,” ranked 21st overall
“The Advocate Guide for LGBT Students” named Carnegie Mellon as one of the best environ­
ments for gay students. Above, a campus organization for gay students hosts a reception.
by Andrew Peters
Assistant Personnel Manager
Forget the “Nerdy Nine” — Carnegie 
Mellon is a new Ivy.
On August 21, Newsweek and Kaplan 
released their annual “How To Get Into 
College” guide, which ranks both univer­
sities and academic programs. “How to 
Get Into College” is published with a list 
of “25 Hot Schools.” This year, in a special 
feature, Carnegie Mellon was named as 
one of 25 “New Ivies.”
According to Newsweek, the universities 
named as “New Ivies” have “seen a rise in 
stature to rival the Ivy League and other 
traditional academic powerhouses in com­
peting for the nation’s top students.”
Other schools on the list include Roch­
ester Polytechnic Institute, Boston College, 
Bowdoin University, New York University, 
and the Claremont colleges. The schools 
on Newsweek’s lists are not actually part of 
the Ivy League, but rather compete with 
Ivies for the top students. Excluded from 
the “New Ivy” list are more traditional 
academic giants such as Stanford, North­
western, and Caltech.
The article also listed “overlap” schools 
comparable to Carnegie Mellon that 
compete for the same students. They 
include Cornell, Massachusetts Institute ?
of Technology (MIT), the University of 
Pennsylvania, Julliard, and the Eastman 
School of Music.
“We’re all schools that are extremely 
powerful in this field of higher educa­
tion,” said William Elliott, Carnegie Mel­
lon’s vice-president of enrollment. “Carn­
egie Mellon is not an old place. We move 
around a lot. We are very mobile.”
“How To Get Into College” also ranks 
Carnegie Mellon number 75 on its list of 
“Top Global Universities.”
JElliott, however, was quick to note that 
the higher a university is ranked, the 
harder it is to keep moving up.
“You’ve got to be really exceptional 
when you get to the top of these rank­
ings,” Elliott said. “The rest of the world 
isn’t standing still.”
Carnegie Mellon also worked its way up 
in the U.S. News & World Report rankings, 
climbing one spot to number 21 on the list 
of “Top National Universities.” The uni­
versity shares its number with University 
of California at Berkeley.
Rankings are based on a number of 
factors, including peer assessment, gradu­
ation and retention rates, faculty-to-stu- 
dent ratio, and selectivity. The U.S. News 
rankings do not, however, take athletics, 
social life, academic offerings, or cost into

Investor buys city building 
for CMU tech companiesUniversities receive joint $15 million grant
by Patrick Pettibon
Stafjwriter
Researchers in Pittsburgh are embarking 
on their first year of finding new ways to 
give sight to the blind, mobility to the handi­
capped, and independence to the elderly.
The National Science Foundation has 
awarded Carnegie Mellon University and the 
University of Pittsburgh a five-year, $15 mil­
lion grant to establish the new Quality of Life 
Technology Engineering Research Center. At 
the center, members of the scientific, engi­
neering, and medical communities will work 
together to develop technologies to help older 
adults and people with disabilities live more 
independently and productively.
The group of researchers is still working 
on the total concept of the project, said Cliff 
Brubaker, dean of the School of Health and 
Rehabilitation Sciences at the University of 
Pittsburgh. The National Science Foundation 
has a lot of requirements, he said, and there 
has to be something very fundamental to the 
work they do.
The focus of the project is to increase 
the independence, quality of life,- and self- 
determination of people who are aging and 
people with disabilities.
“What should result from this is something 
that does not exist today,” Brubaker said.
According to Howard Wactlar, vice-provost 
for research computing at Carnegie Mellon, 
there is no requirement to put products into 
the market.
“We have a broader mission in our work,” 
he said.
Wactlar has pointed out four main thrusts 
for the research. The first is Monitoring and 
Modeling, in which researchers will try to 
capture certain aspects of human behavior 
and further understand certain aspects of 
machine learning.
The second thrust is Mobility and Manipu­
lation. Researchers will attempt to develop 
technologies to make it easier for people with 
disabilities to get around and to allow new 
machines to understand the capabilities of 
the user.
One new machine in development is called 
an Intelligent Mobility Platform. The machine
works much like a traditional walker, adding 
stability for the user, but can also help users 
find their way to their destination. Wactlar 
said researchers hope to develop a walker 
that could go up steps or could prevent the 
user from bumping into walls and obstacles.
The third research thrust is Human-System 
Interfaces, which aids in communication or 
helps in perception of the world. In 2004, 
the National Center for Health Statistics esti­
mated that 35.1 million Americans have hear­
ing impairment and 19.1 million have vision 
problems. This leg of the research initiative 
is aimed at making life easier for people with 
sensory deficits. One such project is Trinetra, 
a device which scans barcodes intended to as­
sist blind people in the grocery store.
Priya Narasimhan, assistant professor of 
electrical and computer engineering and 
computer science, developed the device. She 
said she got the idea while watching how dif­
ficult it was for the blind to catch a bus on a 
snowy Pittsburgh night.

Matters appeared minor at 
first, he said, as the public and 
private sectors remained opened 
in the city and people still went 
to work.
Farjallah described people’s 
initial reaction as optimistic. 
“[People thought] this is one of 
the turmoils that will happen and 
then things will get better.” 
Bridges were bombed, he said, 
and things escalated quickly. 
There was fear that danger 
could spread into the city 
center, where all of the activity 
happens.
“We were hesitant,” he 
recalled, wondering, “Do we 
leave or do we stay?”
Farjallah recalled how he was 
evacuated from Lebanon to Syria 
via a targeted road one week 
after the conflict’s beginning. 
He remembers hearing on the 
news that a bomb had exploded 
just 10 kilometers from his 
vehicle — a big worry, he said.
“Most of the roads by that time 
were hit.”
Back-and-forth violence sub­
sided with the passing of United 
Nations Resolution 1701 in mid- 
August. The resolution called for 
a cease-fire between Israel and 
Lebanon and for the deployment 
of European troops to sustain 
peace.
For Eid, the resolution left him 
with a feeling the conflict could 
have ended sooner. “I think ev­
eryone could have been more 
proactive,” he said.
The Lebanese first-year also 
said he would like to see perma­
nent peace. And while he wants 
the “proposed solution” — the 
cease-fire — to work, he also 
thinks it is temporary. According 
to Eid, in his home country, there 
is now fear of civil war.
Across the border into Israel, 
Levit said the United States has 
been very supportive of his home 
country. Outside countries, he 
noted, have an important role to 
stop conflict.
Levit said that he would like to 
see an international force disarm 
Hezbollah, and he would also 
like see Hezbollah return cap­
tive Israeli soldiers to Israel. He 
doubts, however, that Hezbollah 
will comply without being given 
something in return.
“Otherwise, from their point 
of view, they did not get as much 
out of this conflict,” he said.
Farjallah said that countries 
have shown their support of 
Lebanon by helping to rebuild 
and refinance the country and 
clean the country’s water. “We 
see that there is a commitment 
from the international commu­
nity to help as much as they can,” 
he said.
Farjallah said that he would 
like for people in Lebanon to 
be able to travel and work in 
peace. But he realizes there are 
complications to achieving such 
peace.
“I think peace is a must, and it 
will come. But I think it will take 
some time.”Justin Brown/Assistant Photo Editor

A New York investor is feel­
ing bullish on Carnegie Mellon 
robotics; it is a $22.5 million 
feeling.
Last month, New York investor 
Ira Gorman bought the down­
town Clark Building at 717 Lib­
erty Avenue for his company, 
Singularity Clark L.P. He ex­
pressed a desire to fill the histori­
cal edifice with Carnegie Mellon 
robotics graduates’ start-up com­
panies.
“As time goes on, the tech­
nological innovations happen 
exponentially faster,” Gorman 
said. He cited the recent flood 
of start-up companies coming 
from Carnegie Mellon and said 
he expects the number of ro­
botics start-up companies from 
Carnegie Mellon to jump in the 
coming decade.
An August 21 University press 
release highlights the Center for 
Technology Transfer and Enter­
prise Creation’s success in help­
ing establish 14 companies based 
on University technology in the 
2006 fiscal year. This was up 
from eight the previous year.
The press release states that 
these start-ups “represent a range 
of industries and technology 
areas,” including green chem­
istry, training-simulation game 
development, and industrial con­
trol.
“Pittsburgh is going to be the 
center for artificial intelligence 
and robotics,” stated Gorman 
in the July 14 article “Clark 
Building fetches $22M” in the 
Pittsburgh Business Times. “Pitts­
burgh will be to artificial intel­
ligence what Silicon Valley is to 
chips.”
The Clark Building is a 23:story 
building in the downtown Pitts­
burgh Cultural District. Among 
the tenants are a charter school, 
the Pennsylvania Culinary Insti­
tute, and various jewelers.
“It is a high-visibility build­
ing with great show rooms,” 
Gorman said.
According to a July 14 article 
in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
titled “N.Y. investor buys Clark 
Building,” the Clark Building is 
the fifth major office building to 
be bought by a New York investor 
in the past year and a half.
Carnegie Mellon students are 
optimistic about the purchase. 
“You may help raise your com­
pany’s profile in these buildings 
that, when visited, would give 
an impression of success,” said 
Sarjoun Skaff, a Ph.D. student in 
robotics and an aspiring entre­
preneur.
Gorman is hoping that such 
entrepreneurs and their compa­
nies will take advantage of his 
patronage as he puts his money 
where his mind is.
Behind Gorman’s desk on the 
23rd floor of the Clark Building, 
a one-time regional headquar­
ters for Warner Bros., the row of 
science books with authors such 
as Ray Kurzweil are a testament 
to the man’s faith in robotics as 
an investment.
“[Some of] these books men­
tion Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon all the time.” Gorman 
said.
Carnegie Mellon director of 
Enterprise Creation Robert Lowe 
has helped several start-up com­
panies find homes.
“There is an incredible over­
supply of office space for start­
ups in Pittsburgh,” he said. “The 
companies I’ve helped place in 
offices, including companies I’ve 
founded myself, have all been in 
one of three districts, the Strip/ 
Lawrenceville, Oakland, and the 
South Side. Large warehouses 
and industrial facilities con­
verted into office buildings typi­
cally are better suited for such 
companies.”
Gorman stands by his pur­
chase.
“We will be very accommo­
dating to Carnegie Mellon start­
ups,” referring to those compa­
nies wishing to rent spaces from 
him.
He also expressed a desire 
to speak with Carnegie Mellon 
officials in the future.

In addition to the overall rank­

led by former Coordinator of Stu­
dent Development Rowshawn 
Palmer, and her recent successor, 
Helen Wang. Wang oversees the 
coordination of LGBT program­
ming on campus, aiming to rais­
ing awareness of LGBT issues in 
residential communities.
According to Wang, awareness
of the LGBT lifestyle is key to 
every Carnegie Mellon education 
experience. *
“We want to make [LGBT is­
sues] have meaning to everyone 
on campus,” Wang said. “We are 
working to cultivate this culture 
of awareness on campus.”
SOHO, CMU Allies, cmuOUT, 
and Safezone comprise the 
core of Carnegie Mellon’s LGBT 
community, all of which promote 
the kind of culture that supports 
talking about LGBT issues.
SOHO’s goal is to provide a 
safe space for people of all sexual 
orientations to feel comfortable 
discussing the difficult and sensi­
tive issues surrounding gender 
and identity.
“Can we connect with some­
one from athletics? Can we con­
nect with someone from architec­
ture? From music?” Wang asked, 
speaking of the job she is doing 
raising awareness on campus. 
“Can we connect, not myopically, 
but really listen to what staff and 
students want to say?”
According to Wang, The 
Advocate's ranking shows the Uni­
versity’s potential. Wang would 
like to see the university parlay 
the ranking into an increasingly 
open and tolerant community.

focus on customer service and chang­
ing to meet the demands of the campus 
community to eat when and where they 
want,” stated Tim Michael, director of 
Housing and Dining Services, in an e- 
mail message.
“Most of the new venues will provide 
later-night options by operating until 
midnight, 1 a.m., or 2 a.m.,” he wrote. 
The new venues will continue our trend 
toward lighter, more healthy offerings 
for customers as well as respond to mar­
ket demand for Starbucks-style coffee 
drinks.”
Michael added that the changes were 
based on the. feedback the department 
received from student surveying last 
spring, although he noted that last year’s 
results gave dining the best ranking in 
a five-year upward trend of improved 
attitudes about campus dining.
The new Carnegie Mellon Café in
Resnik, slated to open today,'will pro­
vide Starbucks coffee drinks, as well as 
smoothies, sandwiches, and salads to 
go, hot subs baked* to order, and pastries 
baked on the premises.
“We hope this is going to be the new 
hangout on campus,” said Chris Fitz, 
district manager for Parkhurst, Carnegie 
Mellon’s contracted food provider. “We 
want to create more of a community 
where [students] can sit and relax.”
Michael agreed. “The Carnegie Mellon 
Café is the realization of a multi-year 
effort to reopen the former Highlander 
cafeteria space.... It’s such a great space 
at that location on campus near the Hill, 
and we hope to develop a real campus 
gathering spot there over the next year 
or two.”
The café’s table seating includes soft 
couches and chairs in a larger adjoining 
room, four gaming pods straight from 
the Entertainment Technology Center 
gaming room, and athletic equipment
on the facility’s second-floor rotunda. He 
reported that most of the materials used 
in the new construction are recyclable.
“The Carnegie Mellon Café will apply 
for a LEED certification and should be­
come one of the first LEED-certified col­
lege dining units in the country,” stated 
Michael.
In the UC, Sí Señor has moved down­
stairs into the ‘0”s old location and ex­
tended its hours from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., 
seven days a week; its menu will now 
include breakfast items as well. Penne’s 
International Market and Sushi Two have 
moved into Sí Señor’s old second-floor 
location. In their place is the brand-new 
Sequoia Grill, serving burgers, chicken, 
fries, and fresh premium entrees.
To compensate for the absence of The 
‘O’ this year, Skibo has extended its hours 
from 9 a.m. to 2 a.m., seven days a week. 
The restaurant is also in the process 
of expanding its menu to include more 
breakfast, vegetarian, and vegan items.
Skibo was the chosen venue to fill the 
lO”s shoes because of its central loca­
tion in the UC, according to Skibo Unit 
Manager Richard Kilpatricks.
Kilpatricks also mentioned that the 
establishment is making an effort to im­
prove its customer service due to re­
peated complaints from students last 
year.
“We’re trying to hire better person­
alities,” he said. “We’re in the kitchen for 
the people on campus.”
Andy’s, located in the basement of the 
UC, will now be open from 7 a.m. to 5 
p.m.
“[The University] wanted us open dur­
ing busier times ... almost exclusively for 
lunch,” said Andy’s Manager Haywood 
Vincent.
Among the items now avaliabe at 
Andy’s are a variety of new breakfast 
options, including omelets, burritos, 
and a host of new bakery items. New 
lunch features will include small tossed
and Caesar salads and new once-a-week 
entrees, such as gyros and meat lasagna, 
mixed in with the old favorites.
The Maggie Murph Café, located 
on the first floor in Hunt Library, will 
feature a program similar to that of the 
Carnegie Mellon Café. The venue is a 
joint project between Housing and Dining 
Services, library staff, and alumna of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie College for 
women. Fitz estimated that the new eat­
ery will be up and running within two 
weeks.
The University’s next dining-related 
endeavor will be the Whole Sum Café, a 
vendor cart of sandwiches, salads, and 
other1 “on the go” foods in the Mellon 
Institute.
“We were happy to partner with 
the Library and MCS to provide food 
venues in these two new areas,” stated 
Michael.
Michael reported that student meal 
plans can be used at all the new venues.

Robotics on a roll: Researchers unveil Ballbot
Pluto demoted as 
definition of ‘planet’ 
changes
by Shawn Wertz
Science & Technology Editor
Legs may now be obsolete — at least for 
robots. After a team of Carnegie Mellon 
researchers recently unveiled a new robot 
that requires neither the use of legs nor 
wheels.
Instead, the mobile robot, dubbed Ball­
bot by the team, moves by balancing on 
an aluminum and polyurethane sphere.
Ballbot is the creation of the Robotics 
Institute research professor Ralph Hol­
lis, who built his first robot in 1957.
“When I was in high school I read i 
an article on them in ScientificAmeri- Jj 
can” said Hollis. “I thought they were 
the coolest things.”
But there is very little resemblance 
between Hollis’s new robot and the 
robots he originally read about.
The International Astronomi­
cal Union (IAU) defined the 
meaning of the term “planet” 
last Thursday in a vote that 
ended a centuries-long period 
during which the term had no 
precise definition. However, 
the IAU did not create a defini­
tion for planet for use outside 
Earth’s solar system.
By the new definition, Pluto, 
which was considered a planet 
since its 1930 discovery, now 
merits only “dwarf planet” sta­
tus. It shares this classification 
with two other objects, Ceres 
and UB313, nicknamed Xena. 
Experts expect that many more 
objects, mostly from the Kuiper 
Belt at the edge of the galaxy, 
will soon receive official classi­
fication as “dwarf planets.”
Under the new rules, a full 
planet must orbit the sun and 
clear the “neighborhood around 
its orbit.” A dwarf planet need 
only be massive enough that 
gravity makes it round.
Dwarf planets found outside 
Neptune’s orbit will be named 
after Pluto. No formal term ex­
ists yet, but many IAU members 
support “plutonian object.”

Ozone hole recovery 
date extended
The hole in Earth’s ozone 
layer will not recover until the 
year 2065, United Nations sci­
entists now report. Previously, 
the hole was expected to close 
by 2050.
Earth’s ozone layer, located 
in the stratosphere, shields the 
planet from ultraviolet and 
other types of radiation. Expo­
sure to UV rays alone can kill 
plants at the bottom of the ma­
rine food chain and lead to skin 
cancer in humans. According to 
ozone specialist Geir Braathen, 
“The Antarctic ozone hole has 
not become more severe since 
the late 1990s, but large ozone 
holes are expected to occur for 
decades to come.”
Researchers blame chloroflu- 
orocarbons (CFCs) which used 
to be found in many goods and 
are now banned for damaging 
the ozone layer.

insight into some of the travel­
ing exhibits featured in the Mu­
seum of Natural History, such 
as the current exhibition on the 
science behind taxidermy.
The section will also give 
readers access to exclusive arti­
cles about the museum’s perma­
nent collection and interviews 
with the museum’s experts.

Science & Technology EditorFree energy source 
created, claims Irish 
company claims
Since the Carnegie Museum of Natural History commissioned 
William T. Hornaday in 1878 to prepare a tiger skin, the museum 
has built a large collection of stuffed animals, including mammals 
and birds. The current exhibit examines the scientific process of 
preserving animal skins, and the art of making lifelike mounts.
When students first arrive at 
Carnegie Mellon, the prospect 
of living in Pittsburgh can, 
to some, seem overwhelm­
ingly bleak. A strong 
scientific and cultural 
background is not 
always associ­
ated with a city

An Irish company, Steorn, 
claims that it has found a way to 
generate free energy. The feat, 
if upheld, would dramatically 
change the current understand­
ing of the universe, as accepted 
laws of physics state that energy 
cannot be created or destroyed.
The company’s researchers 
were working on a power source 
for closed-circuit TVs when they 
noticed that they were produc­
ing more power than was be­
ing used. Steorn said that their 
technique involves precisely 
configured magnetic fields, but

Maureen Govern, America 
Online’s chief technology offi­

650.000 customers’ private 
data. The breach happened 
earlier this year, when one of

an academic research program. 
Some of the breached data in­

New safety rules for 
unmanned rockets
Last Friday, the Federal Avia­
tion Administration announced 
new safety standards for un­
manned rockets. The new stan­
dards were prompted by the 
Columbia accident in 2003, in 
which the shuttle fell apart dur­
ing reentry, killing seven astro­
nauts.
The new rules apply to un­
manned rockets that normally 
carry satellites for communi­
cation purposes. The concern 
was that the unmanned rockets 
could suddenly veer off course. 
The concern is even more prev­
alent now that smaller compa­
nies are interested in launching 
more rockets from various loca­
tions, some relatively close to 
established settlements.
The new regulation will re­
quire rocket operators to moni­
tor a rocket’s flight path. Rock­
ets must also have controls on 
them to keep them from hitting 
populated areas.

Study says ancient 
painkillers worked
A new study suggests that 
mint oil once used by ancient 
Chinese populations to ease 
aches and pain may have actu­
ally worked. The discovery was 
made after the study tested 
a synthetic treatment whose 
properties resemble mint oil.
The compound has vari­
ous benefits over traditional 
painkillers, particularly in that 
it can be used on sufferers of 
chronic pain. After an extended 
amount of time, painkillers like 
morphine can lose their effec­
tiveness, a property yet to be 
found in the new compound. 
And because the compound is 
applied topically, it comes with 
a limited list of side effects.

How Things Work: Magnetic Resonance Imaging
Shawn W20*zÆci2nc2 & T2c.ndldgv Edi*d0
The above illustration demonstrates how an MRI of a person’s neck would look. A magnetic resonance image, 
or MRI, converts data gathered by an MRI machine into an image. The different shades of gray correspond 
with different tissue types.
Simran Grover
Advances in medical tech­
nology have changed not only 
the way that doctors treat pa­
tients, but also how doctors dis­
cover what, exactly, needs to be 
treated.
One of the most accurate 
forms of imaging available to 
doctors today is the MRI. An 
MRI, or magnetic resonance im­
age, is a picture of the insides of 
a living organism.
Radio waves produce an MRI 
image, as opposed to the X- 
rays that produce images in CT 
scans.
When the process was first 
used in 1977, it could take up to 
five hours to obtain an image. 
However, due to technological 
advances, what was once a long 
process now takes only seconds.
The most recognizeable char­
acteristic of an MRI machine is 
its magnet, which is cylindrical 
in shape with a hollow center. 
The magnets used in most MRI 
machines are called supercon­
ducting magnets, and are usu­
ally composed of many coils of 
wire.
When the MRI is turned on, an 
electric current passes through 
the coils, and a magnetic field is 
created.
The magnet’s shape serves a 
distinct purpose: The magnet 
surrounds the patient, and the 
MRI machine can take a picture 
of any part of a patient’s body 
without the patient having to 
move to different positions. 
This is especially important for 
patients suffering from injuries 
that make it difficult to move. 
Because of the MRI machine’s 
reliance upon magnets, metal 
objects in the vicinity of the ma­
chine can be very dangerous.
The magnet within an MRI 
machine creates a magnetic 
field whose power increases ex­
ponentially as an object comes 
into closer contact with the ma­
chine.
A physician should be care­
ful about any metal object he 
or she is carrying at the time
of the scan.
Paper clips, pens, and stetho­
scopes, among other objects, 
can be pulled out of pockets, 
without warning, and fly to­
wards the opening of the mag­
net, where the patient is being 
scanned.
Patients with pacemakers, 
especially, are not allowed near
the machine because the mag­
netic force can cause the pace­
maker to malfunction.
Patients with artificial joints 
and metallic bone plates also 
should not have MRIs taken. 
The metal within their bodies 
can actually distort the image.
When the magnet is turned 
on, protons in hydrogen atoms
present in the body act like tiny 
magnets with north and south 
poles.
The body’s atoms align in par­
allel columns that indicate the 
direction of the magnetic field.
Following their alignment, 
the MRI machine then emits ra­
dio waves.
The “magnets” present in the
patient’s tissue atoms then ab­
sorb energy and begin to spin. 
As the atoms spin, they produce 
a signal.
A receiver connected to the 
MRI machine can analyze the 
signals produced from the at­
oms to produce an accurate im­
age. The MRI can collect infor­
mation about the atoms because 
their signal emissions are char­
acteristic to each atom.
Most of the atoms in the body 
are hydrogen atoms, but MRIs 
can also detect areas with in­
creased oxygen, especially in 
areas of increased nerve activ­
ity, as is the brain.
The MRI is useful in detecting 
blood clots, tumors, and other 
abnormalities. It is useful on the 
soft tissues of the abdomen. MRI 
machines are also able to gather 
information on individual blood 
cells.
Because the images produced 
are very detailed, the MRI is the 
scan of choice for diagnosing 
patients. This is especially the 
case for patients with possible 
head trauma, because an MRI 
can easily detect swelling or 
bleeding.
The process of having an MRI 
taken has also changed since 
1977. Before, a patient would 
have to sit for up to five hours 
while the image was captured. 
This was especially problem­
atic for patients suffering head 
trauma.
Today, any patient discomfort 
is minimized because the pro­
cess takes a matter of seconds.
The scan can begin when the 
desired part of the body is in the 
exact center or isocenter of the 
magnet. The MRI essentially 
analyzes the type of tissue it is. 
The scan displays the image in 
varying shades of gray.
Different tissues are given 
a different shade of gray. For 
example, an MRI of the hu­
man brain displays the skull in 
a lighter shade than the actual 
brain.
Radiologists use the informa­
tion obtained from an MRI to as­
sess normal tissue as opposed to 
abnormal tissue.

Above: Professor Ralph Hollis ex­
plains that Ballbot is constructed 
to be easily taken apart and re­
built in the laboratory to add new 
features.
LEGLESS, from A7
“When I first heard about what 
Ralph was doing, there were no 
pictures,” said Mampetta, “but 
when I first saw it balance I was 
completely taken off my feet.”
Ballbot’s future
Ballbot is expected to undergo 
a series of changes in the future. 
The team plans to add a head and 
arms to the robot down the line.
Before the appendages can be
added, however, the team must 
run simulations to determine 
how attaching the arms or head 
would affect Ballbot’s balance.
Hollis said that the team also 
wants to add another motor to 
the robot so that it can turn to­
ward the direction that it moves. 
As for now, the robot can face 
only one direction.
When asked if he hoped that 
Ballbot would eventually be able 
to serve a particular purpose to 
the public, Hollis said, “We’ll 
probably never get it to that stage
by ourselves.”
The team does hope to under­
stand more about how the robot 
will interact with people and fur­
niture in its environment.
With their research, the team 
may find that the inverted mouse- 
ball drive is a big advancement 
in robotics. But for now, there is 
no plan to mass-market a line of 
robots.
“At this point building robots 
is more of an art than a science. 
It’s really hard to generalize the 
process,” said Hollis.

ate student Anish Mampetta sta­
bilizes Ballbot before it is fully 
powered.

As Pittsburgh blossoms, CMU benefits
A town of smokestacks and smog. A
9-to-5 city full of blue-collar pride. An 
industrial hole in the Rust Belt. For de­
cades, Pittsburgh’s reputation has pre­
ceded itself — and it hasn’t been good. 
But this summer, the Steel City proved 
that it is anything but a ghost town. It’s 
a great time to be a Carnegie Mellon 
student in the ’Burgh — and it’ll be even 
better in the coming years.
In the past two years, Intel, Apple, and 
Google have sprouted new research fa­
cilities, all with the hope of collaborating 
with the many innovators at Carnegie 
Mellon.
This summer, New York investor Ira 
Gorman initiated the $22.5 million pur­
chase of the Clark Building downtown, a 
building Gorman wants to be filled with 
tech companies. But why in Pittsburgh? 
Gorman told the Pittsburgh Business 
Times that “Pittsburgh will be to artifi­
cial intelligence what Silicon Valley is to 
[micro] chips.”
As Pittsburgh becomes home to more
robotics, Internet, and other high-tech 
start-ups, and more high-level jobs be­
come available, the city will also attract 
more residents. In the Cultrual District, 
Strip District, and South Side, sleek new 
condos and apartments are springing up 
faster than Pittsburghers can order fries 
on their sandwiches.
But Pittsburghers don’t just want stu­
dents to live and work here — they want 
us to play here, too. With a casino com­
plex coming our way, the over-21 crowd 
will have a difficult time bemoaning that 
there’s nothing to do in the ’Burgh.
Not into gambling? Try a baseball 
game. Not only did Pittsburgh’s PNC Park 
garner national attention by hosting this 
summer’s major league All-Star Game, 
it was also named the “No. 1 Ballpark 
in the Nation,” according to the Reader’s 
Digest “100 Best” issue.
Pittsburgh also has a robust array of 
adventure sports that anyone can try. 
In fact, National Geographic magazine 
ranked Pittsburgh “America’s Best Urban
Adventure City.” Be it hiking, kayaking, 
spelunking, or exploring abandoned asy­
lums, Pittsburgh’s got it.
Carnegie Mellon students have special 
reason to take note of Pittsburgh’s rise 
to excellence. The Mellon Foundation, 
which leverages its $1.8 billion to en­
courage economic development in 
western Pennsylvania, wants Carnegie 
Mellon students to experience more of 
Pittsburgh, presumably so we’ll stay here 
and contribute to its growing high-tech 
economy. To that end, they’ve funded a 
program called Pittsburgh Connections 
that promises to make it easier than ever 
for Carnegie Mellon students to get out 
and experience everything this city has 
to offer.
In 2010, when today’s first-years get 
ready for their commencement, they will 
be living in a different city than the 
one to which they arrived. They will 
have had the pleasure of witnessing and 
the pride of inspiring the renaissance of 
Pittsburgh.
Tips and tricks from savvy Tartans
Hey first-years: Orientation does a 
pretty nice job of (surprise surprise) ori­
enting you to campus, but there are a 
few things we think it leaves out. Here’s 
a list of tips and tricks we’ve picked up 
in our years here at Carnegie Mellon and 
in Pittsburgh. They’re tried and true; put 
them to good use.
Saved by the Bell: In-Class Tips
• Make sure to ask your professors 
on the first day whether you’ll need 
every book they’ve put on the syllabus. 
Sometimes they only assign a single 
chapter, in which case it’s much easier 
(and cost-efficient) to photocopy the 
pages from a friend or take it out of the 
library.
• Didn’t do the reading? Don’t know 
the answer? Don’t look down; that’s 
sheepish. But don’t make eye contact 
with the professor, either; that will get 
you called on for sure. Look pensively 
at the board. If you happen to get called 
on anyway, respond with another ques­
tion: “Give a real-life example of Lacan’s 
theory of the mirror stage? Could we 
actually go over the mirror stage? That 
part of the reading really went over my 
head.” Intentionally revealing a pebble 
of ignorance will save you from acciden­
tally revealing a boulder.
• Professors are almost always willing 
to give extensions on assignments. Just 
make sure you ask far in advance, not the 
day before. This is a great way to balance 
your workload when multiple deadlines 
hit at the same time.
Tricks for Saving Dough
• You don’t have to buy all your books 
from our bookstore. Save money by 
checking out Amazon.com, misc.market, 
or the Pitt bookstore. Since Pitt is so 
much larger than CMU and buys more 
books, they’re often cheaper.
• In the basement of Doherty Hall you 
can buy a soft drink for 50 cents. If you’re 
a little more daring, you can slip into 
the faculty lounge on the fourth floor of 
Wean Hall and buy a bottle for 65 cents. 
If you get quizzical looks from computer 
science professors, play the I’m-just-a- 
wide-eyed-first-year-looking-for-the- 
john card. Especially in a behemoth like 
Wean, that’s easy to believe.
• PlaidCa$h is convenient if you’re on 
campus and practically useless if you’re 
not. Turn PlaidCa$h into real-people 
money by going to the Giant Eagle in 
Squirrel Hill and using it to purchase an 
American Express gift card. Then you 
can use it anywhere that accepts credit 
cards.
Riding PAT: Tips for Taking the Bus
• Sometimes you show your ID when 
you get on the bus, and sometimes when 
you get off. And if you get it wrong, some 
bus drivers get awfully persnickety. If, 
when you step on the bus, the driver has 
his or her hand covering the money slot, 
that means show the ID on your way off. 
If the slot is open, pull it out when you 
step on. When in doubt, three words 
clear it all up: “On or off?” The driver 
will tell you.
• Never try to pull a fast one on the 
driver by using someone else’s ID or lend­
ing your ID to a friend. Anyone caught 
using someone else’s ID will be arrested
— yes, arrested — for identity theft.
• The 59U is not the only bus that goes 
to the Waterfront. Sure, it drops you off 
right in front of the movie theater, but it’s 
infamously irregular. The 61C, D, and F 
all go into Homestead. Get off at the first 
stop past the Waterfront and it’s a five- 
minute walk to wherever you need to go. 
If you’re already in Squirrel Hill, grab a 
64A on Murray.
Miscellaneous and Notorious
• Ethernet bandwidth usage is two 
gigabytes per day, right? Wrong. It’s 10 
gigabytes every five days. Hog the band­
width for a day if you need to download, 
but just make sure you lay off it for a few 
days afterwards.
• The stoplight pattern at the corner 
of Forbes and Morewood is a conundrum 
to newbies. You’ll feel the rhythm even­
tually, but till then: Don’t cross while 
there’s a green light on Forbes; you’ll 
be flattened. The walk signal will then 
flash, but only if you’ve pushed the but­
ton. It’s also easy to cross while the traf­
fic on Morewood has the green, but only 
if there’s no one turning into your path.
Use these tips'and tricks and you’ll be 
a savvy Tartan in no time!
Editor’s Note: The Tartan does not pro­
mote jaywalking. Power-walking, moon- 
walking, and walking the line, however, 
are all encouraged.
An upperclassmen offers 
sage advice to first-years
Benjamin Hackett
New faces, innovative talents, and 
fresh meat, welcome to Carnegie Mel­
lon University. Inherent in your en­
rollment and payment of tuition is an 
unwritten bill of rights afforded to you 
upon joining the Carnegie community. 
First-years are subdued for weeks with 
undiversified talks of diversity, ice 
cream sundaes, and merrymaking un­
der the guise of Playfair and related ac­
tivities. Yet, all the joyous revelry aside, 
have you been informed yet of where 
the loopholes, enjoyable avenues, and 
special spaces hide?
Let me, one who has surged, stum­
bled, and recovered in the path to self- 
realization offer a map to avoid similar 
pitfalls. It would be a grievous error if 
you looked back four or five years from 
now and reflected without a smile com­
ing to your face. However, this is not 
a simple task. Many students arrive in 
their upperclassman years jaded and 
longing for May to arrive as quickly as 
possible.
Waiting to exit is not a proper exit 
strategy.
The ability to recognize your own tal­
ents is one of the great gifts university 
is intended to bring. Perhaps, in high 
school, the jack-of-all-trades mentality 
got you through the day, and perchance 
even into college. The university set­
ting is designed, or at least classically 
intended, to provide you with an acces­
sible environment for determining true 
interests and skills. If you prefer lan­
guages to mathematics, stop pretend­
ing and embrace what you are driven 
towards.
If your father works on Wall Street, 
that alone does not mean that you are 
required to stay in Tepper when your 
heart is really in CFA. Many unhappy 
students fall into that frightful rut by 
denying their true interests and thereby 
falling out of the realm of intellectual 
honesty. There are countless examples 
of students finding their niches and be­
coming great successes in fields they 
never previously considered.
Socially, expansion and networking 
should become prominent in your rep­
ertoire. Remember to never become 
too comfortable in a single social circle. 
While good friends are wonderful and 
necessary for support, never pigeon­
hole yourself into a role. Once you de­
cide to make yourself exclusive to only 
one group, or a specific social type, you 
lose great opportunity for intellectual
development.
Writing off a person or group sim­
ply due to prejudice or predetermined 
thought will inevitably come back to 
haunt you later on in your academic 
career. Specifically, intellectual cir­
cles that are too tight stifle diversity 
of thought. In the future, when the 
lessons learned in university require 
professional application, lacking of a 
healthy diversity of thought is a serious 
hindrance.
Use the University, because the Uni­
versity uses you as well. Many students 
may not enjoy their classes, but that 
alone is not an excuse to write off the 
faculty. The faculty—especially here at 
prestigious Carnegie Mellon University
— are rich with a life’s bounty of experi­
ence and academic trendsetting. At 40- 
plus thousand dollars a year, you should 
strive to take at least as much away from 
Carnegie as you put in. There are ample 
opportunities available, and once you 
acheive intellectual honesty, there are 
whole sets of students and faculty with 
similar interests with whom you should 
collaborate to pursue interests of your 
own. Whether you want to work ,on 
Middle Eastern foreign policy or build 
unmanned military vehicles, there is 
someone else here that shares your in­
terests.
Venturing into Pittsburgh proper is 
key: Never settle to live your Carnegie 
Mellon community life only on and 
near campus. This is a decent city, rich 
with venues and libations factories. 
Live music and theater can be found at 
every turn. There are activities on cam­
pus that are excellent, but make sure to 
hop on that bus and venture around. 
You will find that interaction in the 
community will aid in keeping proper 
perspective when inside the Carnegie 
Mellon bubble.
Lessons learned over the years com­
pel this advice. Remember through 
your time here to be ever expanding in­
tellectually and socially. A great danger 
of finally being on your own is falling 
into the trap of exclusivity and close- 
minded thought. There will always be 
events that rile up the populace, and at 
times one might find oneself attached 
to a number of activist causes. Exercise 
your newfound freedoms, and always 
speak up when something is on your 
mind. Never falter, and never allow 
others to impede your personal prog­
ress. Welcome to Carnegie Mellon; this 
is now your school.

New year, new website, new dance class, new column
_____________Karl Sjogren
Welcome (back) to a new year 
at Carnegie Mellon. Andrea and
I are looking forward to the up­
coming year. We’ve spent the 
summer on a variety of exciting 
projects.
First, we’ve redesigned our 
website, www.karlandrea.com, 
and implemented a content 
management system that will 
enable us to have constantly up­
dated information available to 
students.
Second, we surveyed the stu­
dent body on 12 issues — the 
Dirty Dozen. These are the is­
sues that always come up in our 
discussions with students. Hun­
dreds of students have already
filled out the survey; we thank 
everyone who has. Just from 
our preliminary readings, we’ve 
been able to produce great ideas 
for us to pursue over the coming 
year.
Third, we worked with the 
Athletic Department to create
“Jazz Dance for Non-Majors,” a 
technique-based dance course 
to replace the course that was 
canceled within the drama 
school. The new course’s num­
ber is 69-176, and it is being held 
Mondays and Wednesdays from
1:30 to 2:50.
Traditionally, the student body 
president has used the “Presi­
dential Perspectives” column as 
a way of connecting with cam­
pus to highlight the executive 
agenda; this year I’ll be expand­
ing upon that tradition by allow-
ing all of student government to 
utilize the column to reach the 
campus community.
Expect to hear from Student 
Senate, GSA, SDC, AB, etc. over 
the coming months.
Next week, you’ll also hear
what we plan to work on for the 
upcoming year. While we only 
have one school year to make a 
difference, we have a lot in mind 
for the campus community. We 
hope you’ll be a part of our posi­
tive community change.
Welcome (back)!
Student Body President Karl “El 
Presidente” Sjogren and Vice- 
President Andrea Hamilton 
welcome questions, comments, 
and feedback at sbp@andrew. 
cmu.edu.

College football is back again
by Doug Fricker
Staffwriter
The end of August signals three 
things: the time to stow away 
your white clothes, the unfortu­
nate start of school after what 
was surely a summer of rest and 
relaxation, and most importantly, 
another college football season 
kicking into gear.
On Thursday, Boston College 
travels to play Central Michigan 
to kick off the 2006 college 
football campaign. It will be no 
easy task to follow up last year’s 
season-closing game, a game 
many feel was one of the greatest 
ever played. Last year, the Texas 
Longhorns became the national 
champions thanks to a stunning 
performance by quarterback 
Vince Young, as they came back 
to defeat the USC Trojans and 
Matt Leinart and Reggie Bush in 
the Rose Bowl.
This season, USC and Texas are 
in similar boats, as both teams 
are relying on inexperience at 
the quarterback position. Junior 
John David Bpoty is at the helm 
for USC, and redshirt freshman
Colt McCoy and true freshman 
Jevan Snead are both in the 
running to replace Young, with 
McCoy having a slight edge at 
this point.
Ohio State is the consen­
sus number-one team in the 
Associated Press (AP) preseason 
rankings (although these rank­
ings matter about as much as 
who’s behind you in the buf­
fet line). The Buckeyes return 
seven starters on offense from a
10-2 team that last season won 
the Fiesta Bowl. Quarterback 
Troy - Smith and wide receiver 
and playmaker Ted Ginn Jr. are 
both legitimate Heisman candi­
dates, but in order to keep their 
number-one ranking, their de­
fense will have some big shoes 
to fill, as they must replace nine 
starters.
Notre Dame is right behind 
Ohio State in the rankings, and 
Texas, despite losing Young, is 
ranked number three in the AP 
poll, followed by Auburn, with 
Big East conference member 
West Virginia rounding out the 
top five. West Virginia has one 
of the best quarterback/running 
back tandems in college football
today, with' Pat White under cen­
ter and Steve Slaton in the back- 
field. The blazing-fast White has 
been clocked at 4.4 seconds in 
the 40, and Slaton ran for over 
1100 yards last year as a fresh­
man. .
The preseason favorite for the 
Heisman award, given to college 
football’s best player, is Notre 
Dame quarterback Brady Quinn, 
who is the top returning Heisman 
vote-getter. Quinn and talented 
wide receiver Jeff Samardjia 
will “shake and bake” defenses 
all year long, resulting in touch­
downs and wins. Oklahoma 
running back Adrian Peterson, 
Florida quarterback Chris Leak, 
and Louisville quarterback Brian 
Brohm are among the others 
expected to vie for the coveted 
trophy.
The college football schedule 
this fall is as full as a fat lady’s 
sock. The first couple of weeks 
of the season will showcase some 
scintillating showdowns, includ­
ing Florida State battling Miami 
on Labor Day, and Penn State 
traveling to Notre Dame and Ohio 
State at Texas on September 9. 
Other games that you can’t afford
to miss include LSU at Auburn 
in mid-September, Michigan at 
Ohio State in mid-November, 
and Notre Dame at USC in late 
November.
The Bowl Championship Series 
(BCS) has been modified slightly 
with the new setup consisting of 
five games instead of the previous 
four. Back are the Fiesta Bowl, 
Orange Bowl, Rose Bowl, and 
Sugar Bowl. New to the BCS is 
the BCS National Championship 
Game, which will pit the top two 
teams against each other to deter­
mine the national champion. The 
game is to be played in Glendale, 
Ariz., and will cap off the 2006 
college football season.
Ohio State and West Virginia 
appear to have all the tools nec­
essary to make it to Glendale, as 
long as they can stay healthy and 
keep their offenses running on all 
cylinders. As the old phrase goes, 
“Defense wins championships,” 
but with quarterbacks like Smith 
and White and playmakers like 
Ginn and Slaton, my advice to 
the defenses of the Buckeyes and 
the Mountaineers is to just hang 
on, enjoy the ride, and don’t blow 
this golden opportunity.
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon sports news recapped
by Erin Gagnon
Sports Editor
Welcome back to Pittsburgh 
and to campus. Assuming that 
you survived your first Monday 
morning 8:30 a.m. class (which 
frankly will be the last time you 
wake up for it), take a minute and 
get up to speed with a summer’s 
worth of Pittsburgh and Carnegie 
Mellon sports.
The biggest event you missed 
was Major League Baseball’s All- 
Star Game. Pittsburgh was abuzz 
with excitement for the midsum­
mer classic that took place July 
11 at PNC Park. In addition to the 
All-Star Game, the week of fes­
tivities included the Home Run 
Derby, the Futures Game, and the 
Legends and Celebrities Softball 
Game. Ryan Howard cranked out 
23 home runs to win the Home 
Run Derby, and the American 
League once again won the All- 
Star Game (3-2), securing home
field advantage in the World 
Series come October.
Coming off the All-Star high, 
Pittsburghers did not have to wait 
long for more sports excitement 
as Steelers training camp opened 
in Latrobe in the beginning of 
August.
Sadly, for some, the opening 
of camp was bittersweet as the 
day also marked the closing of 
Latrobe’s Rolling Rock plant. 
(The Pennsylvania beer was 
purchased by Anheuser-Busch 
and moved to Newark, N.J.) 
Steelers camp went off without 
a hitch with Ben Roethlisberger 
in attendance and miraculously 
healthy. Roethlisberger’s real test 
will come in the regular season 
opener September 7 against the 
Dolphins.
Focusing in on Carnegie 
Mellon, the most obvious change 
to the campus landscape (out­
side of “Walking to the Sky,” 
of course) is the resurfacing of 
the Gesling Stadium field. The
installation of the bright green 
FieldTurf closed the stadium for 
most of the summer. FieldTurf, 
which is a mix of silica sand and 
cryogenic rubber, is supposed to 
increase player safety and lower 
field maintenance costs.
While Gesling Stadium was 
getting a face-lift, additions were 
made within the athletic com­
munity as well. During the off­
season, Carnegie Mellon added 
three new faces to the athletic 
community, hiring Gary Aldrich 
as the associate head coach to 
the men’s and women’s track and 
field teams, and Rob Czlonka and 
Tony Mohammed as assistant 
coaches for the men’s and wom­
en’s soccer teams, respectively.
A specialist in field events, 
Aldrich previously coached 
at Slippery Rock University, 
Allegheny College, and most 
recently Alfred University (1995- 
1998). Aldrich completed his 
undergraduate work at Slippery 
Rock in 1982 and went on to
finish his master’s at Slippery 
Rock (1989) as well.
Czlonka spent the 2005 sea­
son as an assistant coach to the 
men’s soccer team at Oberlin 
College. Before Oberlin, Czlonka 
spent three seasons coordinating 
the soccer programs at^Hawaii 
Baptist Academy. Czlonka grad­
uated from Chowan College in 
1997.
Mohammed spent last 
year at SUNY New Paltz as an 
assistant coach to the men’s soc­
cer team. Before that, he was 
the interim head coach for the 
women’s program at Vassar 
College. Mohammed earned 
his undergraduate degree at 
Kenyon College in 1997 and his 
master’s degree at St. Lawrence 
University.
Now that you’re caught up to' 
speed, keep in mind that most 
of Carnegie Mellon’s teams are 
opening their seasons this week­
end; there will be plenty of sports 
to come.

Just 57 years ago, the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology’s fledgling radio station broadcast a 
meager six to 12 hours a day to a few rooms in CIT.
In 1974, WRCT, now at 88.3 FM, made the move 
from AM radio, significantly increasing its broadcast 
area. Twenty years later, in 1994, WRCT doubled 
its broadcasting area to 12-15 miles from campus.
The station offers live broadcasts on its website, 
www.wrct.org, and now you can read about WRCT 
in Pillbox’s new weekly column, Paperhouse. Each 
week, Paperhouse will offer insight into the campus 
music scene that WRCT helps create. The Tartan 
would like to welcome WRCT to Pillbox.

What not to eat: ramen
Don’t fall victim to this classic first-year mistakeDid you know?
The start of a new school year typically brings 
about thoughts of reunions with friends, 
optimism for new classes, and an academic 
tabula rasa. However, after life is unpacked from 
boxes and some serious benjamins are dropped 
at the bookstore, the reality of college poverty 
finally sets in. Strapped for cash and accepting 
the funds spent on books as fixed and sunk, the 
frugal student and amateur consumer economist 
naturally focuses on the costs well within his 
power to control: food. While this can be a good 
exercise in personal finance, the long-term health 
ramifications of consuming inexpensive food 
with little to no nutritional value are serious, and 
can set a precedent for (un)wellness for adult life 
outside of school. Given the wide availability, 
great taste, and, most importantly, low cost of 
healthy food, there is no reason to consume 
popular dime meals such as ramen.
It is only natural that the profit-seeking student 
sees a 12-pack of Maruchan Ramen at Giant • 
Eagle for $1.50 and'— after doing some basic 
arithmetic — says, “Wow! Thirteen cents per 
package! With the money I will save on lunch, I 
can finally afford to impress Julio/Julia and cook 
for him/her, and invite 46 of our closest friends. 
(Thanks, Facebook!)” v
While pondering the prospects over a bowl 
of ramen, the left arm of our protagonist feels 
a shooting pain, and soon the next great 
microeconomist is collapsed on the floor from a 
heart attack. Fortunately he is able to be revived, 
but after recuperation at home and many more 
ramen lunches later, he eventually seizes up and 
loses consciousness, ultimately suffering a stroke 
and dying... all over trying to save a couple of 
bucks.
While ramen is by far one of the most inexpensive 
foods on the market, it just might be the most
hazardous to your health. A package consisting 
of a dried noodle block and a packet of seasoning 
(technically two whole servings) typically 
contains about 1800 milligrams of sodium, which 
is over 90 percent of the recommended daily 
intake. The seasoning carries most of the blame 
for that, but the benign-looking noodles are no 
innocent party. The noodles are deep-fried at a 
factory, then formed into little bricks and dried. 
Besides being devoid of any significant amount 
of vitamins or minerals, the high salt content of 
the seasoning combined with the saturated fat in 
the noodles is a significant contributor to weight 
gain, heart disease, and stroke.
Eating healthily is well within the budget of 
any student. While seven cents per serving 
is hard to beat, normal spaghetti with tomato 
sauce and bread costs little more than $1 per 
serving, is available at any grocery store, and 
provides the carbohydrates and minerals to fuel 
" an active lifestyle without any of the saturated 
fat and sodium of pre-packaged ramen. As any 
healthy diet needs more than carbs, fruits and 
vegetables are not too far away or out of budget. 
The new Giant Eagle Market District at Centre 
and Negely avenues, as well as vendors at the 
Oakland Farmers Market and the Strip District, 
consistently have high-quality produce at 
reasonable prices.
While seeking and preparing fresh ingredients 
is not going to be as easy as pouring hot water 
over a block, and while the price of the alternative 
presented is a little higher than the status quo, a 
question is raised: Which.is more important, your 
wallet or your health?

The long-anticipated TV to be set up in the 
Carnegie Union was finally unveiled to the applause 
of anxious Tech students. Without the support of 
our faculty, who volunteered to pay half the cost 
of the new installation, the students would have 
missed the infamous appearance of Elvis that 
aired on The Ed Sullivan Show that fall. It would be 
the last instance of- hip-gyrating many students at 
Carnegie Tech would ever witness.
Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trustees announced 
their approval of a 15 percent tuition increase to 
$6300 for the upcoming 1982-1983 school year. 
Mel Berstein, the associate dean of CIT and the 
Tuition Committee chairman stated that he did 
not “believe that next year’s increase will deter 
applicants.” Spectacular logic: More incoming 
students definitely equals more people happy to 
be paying the high tuition costs.
It’s kind of hard to imagine life at Carnegie Mellon 
without it, but until ten years ago today there 
was no University Center. Students celebrated 
the historic event with an indoor performance of 
the much-adored bagpipe band. They played a 
section of traditional Scottish songs like “Danny 
Boy” and, of course, the “Macarena.”
The campus police responded to a call from 
The Original Hot Dog Shop about a grease fire. 
Fortunately, the fire had been extinguished by the 
time the cops and firemen arrived on the scene. For 
the next five years, students benefitted from not 
only the immaculate, enduring conditions of the old 
greasy spoon, but also the ever-jovial, courteous 
staff working in that sterile environment.
The six truck-food vendors located for years on 
Tech Street were relocated by the University to 
Margaret Morrison Street. Possible reasons for this 
action may have included:
1. The non-aerodynamic structure of the trucks 
making them repeatedly the worst contenders 
for the buggy races,
2. Rushed business students complaining about 
the spilled Thai on their ties, or
3. Relocating the trucks to open up a whole new 
seven parking spots on Tech Street. Now only 
4993 students are without spots.

Dorm Slippers and backpacks by Greg 
Runco and Stephen Spencer are some 
of the latest entrepreneurial ventures 
by Carnegie Mellon students.

Catching the entrepreneurship bug
Carnegie Mellon students’ ideas go from sketchpads to shelves with new product lines
In the bookstore, across from the likes of Dhaima Bums and 
Elementary Differential Equations, new products will be 
popping onto the shelves. The first-years may have akeady 
stumbled upon them while their jubilant parents searched for 
“Carnegie Mellon Dad" T-shirts and “Tartan Pride" running 
shorts. Two new products now on shelves are Dorm Slippers 
and a new design of Carnegie Mellon backpacks; both 
products were designed by and got to the shelves due to the 
tenacity of a couple of Carnegie Mellon students. Backpacks 
designed by Stephen Spencer and slippers developed by Greg 
Runco are on sale now in the Carnegie Mellon bookstore.
The "entrepreneurial bug," as it is sometimes called, has not 
just infected Carnegie Mellon students; starting businesses 
while in college appears to be more common now than 
ever before. Entrepreneur, a magazine titled after its target 
audience, reported in December 2004 that business owners 
and entrepreneurship education programs were on the rise 
in colleges. What might a college-aged student provide as a 
service, or create as a product? "Students launch products 
and services to meet the needs of their college comrades, 
from food- or laundry-delivery services to dorm-room furniture 
retailing," writes Entrepreneur.
Both Runco and Spencer, struck by the entrepreneurial spirit, 
developed products to suit the needs of the everyday student. 
Spencer, a senior BHA student, started early: He funded 
his high school purchases with sales of his specially made 
boomerangs rather than shilling capris at the Gap. ‘Td been 
making and selling boomerangs for cash so I didn't have to 
work. I sold most of them on eBay and at parks in Rochester," 
said Spencer. "It was enough [money] for a high school kid."
He showed up to Carnegie Mellon not even knowing what 
industrial design was, but after some time discovered 
his interest in it and applied to the BHA program. His 
independent study in design spurred him on in the quest 
to design a better bag. "I’d thought about making a bag for 
CMU students for a long time," Spencer said. "When I got the 
grants, the money made it worthwhile.” With the money from 
two SURG (Small Undergraduate Research Grant) awards, 
Spencer began his own business: Custom Sespence, whose 
uncommon spelling of “suspense” comes from Spencer’s
Andrew ID. Being the proprietor of Custom Sespence,
Spencer could then buy items wholesale and charge state tax. 
On the issue of the difficulty of starting one’s own business, 
he said, “Once you decide to do it it’s not that hard.... Fill out 
paperwork, pay a fee, and you’re all set.”
Spencer’s general business idea was to enable companies, 
or in this case universities, to fully customize a product that 
would bear their logo. Most companies currently refer to large 
catalogs of basic products, such as backpacks, and do minor 
customization (i.e. color or size changes) and then add logos, 
but Spencer’s idea was to take the customization further. The 
new customized bags would be designed specifically for the 
company and would meet its specifications, said Spencer. 
Custom Sespence would work with the company, enabling 
it to have a closer connection to the design and to offer 
something that better embodied the company’s wishes for a 
product bearing its name.
For the custom-made Carnegie Mellon backpack, Spencer 
incorporated new designs not commonly seen in bags. He 
created a round bungee cord that can hold a windbreaker, 
shirt, or other piece of clothing. He added side access 
pockets, adapted the straps so that they would not dig into 
neck or chest, and even added a lime-green liner. "Most of 
the backpacks I've owned have had a dark interior, and you 
can’t see things in there,” Spencer said, explaining the bright 
lining. In order to produce a shipment of his bags, however, 
Spencer had to contact a wholesale merchant and send a 
prototype. The product went through two or three revisions 
before Spencer was satisfied, and the bags have been sold in 
the bookstore since the spring of 2005.
On the other side of the entrepreneurial spectrum, Runco 
developed his idea for Dorm Slippers in the most logical 
location: around the residence hall and at his fraternity. “I 
thought [the slipper line] would meet a demand and be a fun 
project,” Runco said.
overseas manufacturer to adapt a current design, and market 
it to lounging college students, forever fond of placing fuzzy 
slippers on their feet. After getting in touch with a wholesale 
manufacturer, Runco went through four trial shipments.
But being an entrepreneur is about more than good design 
and a good idea. As Runco noted, "All along the way you 
have to think about how you want to market it." An avid 
reader of marketing books, Runco decided to do some of the 
advertising and sales pitching in new ways. Utilizing the ever- 
popular social-network-turned-marketing-heaven website 
Facebook, he friended a large number of the first-years and 
placed pictures of his product in his photo gallery. He also 
built the display case that the bookstore uses to house his 
products.
Both Spencer and Runco did much of the work designing or 
developing a product, working with wholesale retailers, and 
making sales while taking courses as well. "One thing that’s 
definite: You can’t be someone that has to get straight As; 
you won’t have the time,” said Runco. Running a business 
on top of classes seems like quite a full plate, but as the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette noted in its August 2004 article 
on local entrepreneurs: "[Cjollege may actually be the ideal 
time to pursue entrepreneurship. Because students are often 
free from the ’real-world’ concerns such as finding a job or 
buying a house, many say they are able to take greater risks 
and spend more time developing a business.” If students are 
distant from the real world, then starting their own business is 
certainly one way to experience it.
In the future, Spencer has ambitions to turn away from bag 
making and turn more towards furniture production. Runco 
plans to develop a new website that will function similar to 
Facebook, but will allow music students across the country to 
share their work. Neither Spencer nor Runco has intentions 
of continuing to produce bags or shoes in the long term, but 
both have ambitions of entrepreneurial ventures in the future. 
It seems that once bitten by the entrepreneurial bug, college 
students continue to see opportunities for new products and 
services that can better everyday life.

He'd been interested in shoes for some time, but found 
that it was easier to break into college bookstores than, say, 
Foot Locker. “At first I wanted to start a straight-up shoe

Super Mario goes classical
Play! and Video Games Live have successful toursJ^Paperhouse
“On experimental music
This summer, thousands of bands and fans jumped 
onto a cultural bandwagon that started up almost 20 
years ago. Eight-bit bleeps from the '80s have evolved 
into more than a marginal genre, and music from video 
games is now drawing a larger crowd than ever.
Two programs of video game music arranged for a 
symphony orchestra swept America over the past few 
months. Play! A Video Game Symphony and Video 
Games Live went on tour and performed for sold-out 
audiences. Play! even went overseas to Europe and 
drew enormous crowds in Stockholm and Vienna.
The Mann Center in Philadelphia hosted Play! in 
late July. The one-night event treated a large crowd 
to music from games such as Silent Hill and Metal 
Gear Solid. Arnie Roth conducted the Mann Festival 
Orchestra and Chorus in a solid set of performances 
from over 15 years of games. Play! drew a crowd 
through the wind and the rain, and despite the dreary 
weather, the whole audience cheered for every piece 
the orchestra played and every announcement Roth 
made.
Roth has an impressive reputation for conducting 
orchestras and video game music. He serves as the 
music director of the Chicagoland Pops Orchestra and 
has experience with many different musical styles. 
After spearheading the 2004 debut of Dear Friends in 
Los Angeles, Roth took the program of Final Fantasy 
music on tour and then worked to create Play! with 
JMP Productions.
When Roth walked onstage to the wild cheers of the 
audience at the Mann Center, his confident stride, 
white suit, and ponytail echoed the concert’s youthful 
atmosphere. The orchestra wore relaxed apparel, and 
the usual shirt-and-tie-for-a-symphony attitude was 
not felt anywhere in the audience. Video game music 
appeals to a markedly young crowd, but many middle- 
aged couples also came to see the slightly unorthodox 
orchestra event.
The performers did not have to learn difficult repertoire, 
but some edges were a little rough. The orchestra 
members lost each other sometimes, but the concert as 
a whole was very solid. Sometimes one could see the 
boredom in the faces of the players, but the ecstatic 
audience always rewarded them with resounding 
support. The principal trumpet had a blast with his solo 
in the "Marble Zone Theme” from Sonic the Hedgehog 
because of audience cheers, and the chorus received 
rapturous applause for their performance of the sinister 
“One-Winged Angel” from Final Fantasy VU.
Three large screens placed above the orchestra 
displayed video feeds of the performers and clips 
from selected games. The producers chose to show 
a lot of coverage of the musicians, which effectively 
emphasized the orchestra facet of the concert and 
highlighted an ensemble that many in attendance may 
never have seen live before. Play! succeeded both as 
a celebration of video games and a showcase of the 
orchestra.
Play! wanted to appeal to all kinds of fans, even if the 
tunes from games like Battlefield 1942 and World of
Warcraft felt obligatory and dull. Probably the best 
selections were from Final Fantasy, Kingdom Hearts, 
Shenmue, and Chrono Trigger. The world premiere of 
music from the brand-new title Prey and the encore 
performance of music from the upcoming Blue Dragon 
gave the concert even more excitement.
As the self-proclaimed "ultimate tour to the fans,”
Play! gave all the attendees free passes to download 
the popular soundtrack from The Elder Scrolls IV: 
Oblivion and played video recordings of messages from 
superstar video game composers Nobuo Uematsu and 
Koji Kondo. This type of attention given to the audience 
made the concert worthwhile and rewarded those who 
traveled a long distance to see the performance.
With techniques like these, Play! has attracted and 
kept huge crowds. It will travel to Toronto at the end 
of September, and Video Games Live, the other large 
symphony program tour, led by Tommy Tallarico and 
Jack Wall, will travel to Brazil and continue to visit 
many cities across America. These orchestral programs 
show the great possibilities of video game music, and 
the evolution of video games as art has drawn other 
performers around the world. The London Symphony 
Orchestra has put together great albums of arranged 
music from the Dragon Quest series and recorded 
music for the hit game Xenosaga.
Video games draw artists other than orchestra 
musicians, too. The Foo Fighters and Godsmack have 
music in Electronic Arts’ NFL Madden '06, and the 
rapper Papoose wrote music exclusively for that title. 
Film composer Danny Elfman, of Edward Scissorhands 
fame, wrote the theme for Fable, a role-playing 
adventure game. Michael Giacchino, who scored the 
music for Thelncredibles, composed the soundtracks 
to the Medal of Honor series of games.
Recently, the three major console giants — Sony, 
Microsoft, and Nintendo — have all realized the 
potential for the music in their games. Sony sponsored 
tours of game music including the PS Dual Play, 
and Nintendo had fresh bands play on the Nintendo 
Fusion Tour. Microsoft combined the popularity of 
Incubus with its blockbuster Halo series to create a 
well-received event where gamers could play against 
on-tour musicians.
Sharon Shapiro, senior director of promotions 
and sports product marketing for Sony Computer 
Entertainment America, told The Financial Times that 
she saw the Playstation as “a way of life entrenched 
in the consumer's everyday experience." As video 
game music grows in popularity, this way of life will 
be tapped by more bands and orchestras. The Video 
Games Live tour is already scheduled to make the 
American rounds for many months. The art form is 
taking root and spreading, and soon we can all forget 
about those old bleeps.

radio station,
Wikipedia defines experimental music as “any music that challenges 
the commonly accepted notions of what music is,” and for the 
purpose of this column, I will stick with that relatively simple definition. 
Experimental music is often, to me, music which defies expectation. 
More often than not when you listen to music, whether actively or 
passively, you hold certain expectations of what it will sound like or 
how it will make you feel.
So why should we listen to experimental music?
My favorite reasons as to why you should listen to experimental music 
revolve around experiencing something new, challenging your own 
definitions and views on what is and what isn’t music, and the thrill of 
discovery. We live in a world where almost every inch of ground has 
been mapped. Uncharted territory is a thing of the past, and we can’t 
just set off exploring in an arbitrary direction to truly face the unknown. 
Experimental music can give us the chance to experience that feeling 
of novelty that, thanks to the information age, has been so absent in 
our lives, and can allow us to make a very personal connection with 
the world of sound around us that will forever remain unexplored 
simply because it is not for others to map, describe, or explain.
If experimental music is so exciting, why aren’t more people 
listening to it?
So many people who enjoy music are stuck within the output of their 
preferred genres and artists. Habits'and conditioning could be blamed, 
and I think people could also be afraid of changing their opinions. If 
we've liked the same things for most of our lives, what kind of impact 
would a change to that set of things have on ourselves? You might just 
find music outside of your boundaries difficult to relate to, or maybe 
you think it sounds bad or "wrong.”
How does one break into experimental music?
What I propose is to probe your impulses a little further and challenge 
yourself to discover exactly what sounds you like and why. It can be 
an entertaining exercise to figure out exactly what your ear enjoys 
the most. You may find that you can't really discover an answer, and 
for some an answer may come instantly and inspire you to explore 
something new. An excellent place to start on your journey of sound, 
and one of the pieces of media that I started with a few years ago, is 
Leonard Bernstein’s Norton Lecture Series entitled The Unanswered 
Question. Bernstein tackles the history of classical music along with a 
discussion of why and how we make music and why Western music 
sounds the way it does. Hunt Library has copies, so check it out if 
you're looking to absorb some knowledge.

Pittsburgh native documents Katrina aftermath
Susie Shapira displays her photography at Garfield Artworks and the Shadow Lounge
Pittsburgh native Susie Shapira has made a career of taking 
photographs of natural and human devastation. Her latest 
project, titled Hunicane Katrina: One Year On, is coming 
to Garfield Artworks this Wednesday for a one-night-only 
showing at 7 p.m. It will include over 40 images of the 
wreckage, victims, and rebirth that followed one of the 
nation’s most severe natural tragedies.
Shapira's exhibit draws from two locations: Mississppi and 
New Orleans. Following Katrina’s initial impact, Shapira 
shot a collection of images of the destruction in Mississippi; 
she then returned eight or nine months later to reshoot 
some of the same sites. Combining the photographs from . 
both ventures, Shapira was able to create some moving and 
inspirational before-and-after displays which demonstrate 
how areas that once appeared hopelessly ruined were 
eventually revived.
Additionally, much of Shapira's presentation is from several 
months she spent this year in New Orleans, from April to early 
August. Here she covers residential damage, neighborhoods 
that were almost entirely wiped out by the storm. Shapira also 
took pictures of wreckage left over from months after Katrina 
first hit New. Orleans. Shapira was shocked by how little had 
been repaired over time, unlike in Mississippi. "Frankly," she 
said, "I was disgusted at the fact that I arrived at New Orleans 
in April to a city that had barely been cleaned up."
Shapira, who lived in New Orleans for a short time in 1999, 
noted that the tone of the city has changed significantly.
The parts of New Orleans that were the most significant to 
local culture were also the most devastated by the storm. 
Meanwhile, Katrina did little to no harm to many of the city’s 
tourist destinations, which were often at relatively higher 
elevations. “The French Quarter, by some miracle of God, was 
not damaged," Shapira explained. As a result, current visitors 
to the city might underestimate Katrina’s lasting impact. 
Shapira said, "It’s almost like the storm didn't happen."
Shapira aims to remind America of the hardships experienced 
by some of its people. "That's my mission,” she said. Shapira 
resents the media’s narrow-minded coverage of Katrina. 
Though many news broadcasts highlighted the devastation 
in context of the affected demographics, the storm did not 
target its victims by race or economic class. Shapira’s exhibit 
contains photographs of wealthy communities, as well as 
lower-class areas, destroyed by the impact. ^
“It's what I do.”
"I shoot emergencies, generally speaking," said Shapira. "It’s 
always difficult; it’s always emotional." Shapira attributes 
her passion for documenting such radical subject matter in 
part to her background in public health. Her portfolio also 
includes landscapes and portraits of adults and children, some 
of which are currently on display in the Pittsburgh Children's 
Museum, but exposing her audiences to issues of global 
concern has proven to be her calling.
Shapira has done her share of globetrotting in recent years. 
Her work has taken her to Ethiopia in the pursuit of images 
capturing the effects of widespread famine and malnutrition; 
she also visited Argentina following its 2001 economic 
collapse, as well as Niger after the 2005 food crisis. Shapira 
traveled twice to Sri Lanka, once immediately after the 2004 
tsunami and again for its one-year anniversary.
Katrina, however, was her first photographic expedition that 
did not require a trip out of the country. "It’s very jarring,” she 
explained. "It makes you realize that this happened to people 
like you." Though the media are guilty of distorting certain 
elements of the Katrina aftermath, Shapira noted one news 
item that she said unfortunately has not been exaggerated: 
The Katrina relief efforts have done little to help the city of 
New Orleans. “It’s something you wouldn’t ever believe of 
the United States of America," said Shapira, speaking of the 
government's inefficacy.
Shapira learned from her travels that New Orleans, even now, 
is a mess. The cost of living has skyrocketed, and utilities like 
water, electricity, and phone service are spotty at best. "You 
have to really, really want to be in New Orleans right now," 
she said. "It's been a fight every day there. It’s chaos.”*
As far as rebuilding is concerned, those involved have a lot of 
work ahead of them. "I am really trying to sort of encourage 
people to go and see for themselves,” Shapira said. In 
addition to using her photography as a platform to educate 
her audiences, Shapira is sending a portion of her sales from 
Katrina: One Year On to the charitable organizations-Habitat 
for Humanity and Operation Reach. The show at Garfield 
Artworks will also feature a donation box for any who are 
interested in contributing to the revitalization of New Orleans.
“The city is changing.”
Shapira has already lived to see an American city undergo 
a radical, albeit different, transformation — the city of 
Pittsburgh. Though she grew up here, Shapira has only 
recently discovered Pittsburgh to be an up-and-coming 
center for the arts. Some of her friends from high school who 
moved back to the city noticed the change and suggested to 
Shapira that she bring her exhibit here. Shapira mentioned 
that Pittsburgh is an attractive cultural environment in part 
because it is full of receptive minds. “Pittsburgh has a great 
audience right now,” said Shapira, enthusiastic about the 
development. "It's great for Pittsburgh.”
Sarah Mogin | Assistant Pillbox Editor
"Katrina: One Year On" is scheduled for 7p.m. Wednesday at 
Garfield Artworks (4931 Perm Avenue). Afterwards, Shapira's 
photographs will be on display at the Shadow Lounge (5972 
Baum Boulevard) throughout September. To learn more about

American Beauty
Wednesday, August 30
10 12:30
This movie is the most uplifting 
depressing film I’ve ever seen. 
Kevin Spacey plays a dad in 
American suburbia who becomes 
increasingly disaffected with 
the life he lives, driving him to 
take more risks and live out his 
fantasies. What he doesn’t realize, 
though, is how his actions are 
affecting the rest of his family and 
neighbors. This movie won five 
Oscars, including Best Picture, 
and if you haven’t seen it, you 
absolutely should.
Heat
Thursday, August 31

Robert De Niro! Al Pacino! 
Smoldering intensity! A heist! Heat 
has it all. This movie tells the tale 
of a master thief and the detective 
trying to stop him, and many 
consider it to be one of the best 
cop/heist movies ever. It’s highly 
stylized, as all heist movies are, but 
the real reason to see it is Pacino 
and De Niro passionately shouting 
orders at everyone for two hours.
Thank You For 
Smoking

We’ve had it hammered into our 
heads for years that smoking is 
bad for us. But what about all 
those poor folks who work for 
the tobacco companies? Thank 
You For Smoking follows Nick 
Naylor, a masterful spokesman 
for the tobacco industry, as he 
travels around the country trying 
to drum up support for cigarettes. 
This movie succeeds because the 
situations it presents are so absurd 
that it doesn’t matter what you 
believe in — they’re still funny.
The Pink Panther
Saturday, September 2

Sacré bleu! Steve Martin 
resurrects the accident-prone 
Inspector Clouseau in this tepid 
remake. While it’s nice that 
the kind folks at Sony Pictures 
decided to let a new generation 
of kids get a taste of one of 
film’s more beloved characters, 
eventually people will get tired of 
remakes. One can dream, at least. 
The Pink Panther should still be 
good for a few dumb laughs; it 
also stars funnyman Kevin Kline.
Heavenly Creatures
Sunday, September 3 
81012
This Peter Jackson movie, from 
his days before hobbits, is about 
two girls who give up everything, 
including their innocence, to remain 
friends when one girl’s mother 
becomes worried about their 
dangerously intense relationship.
It takes place in the ’50s, but 
something tells me there won’t 
be many “gosh darns” and “gee 
golly”s. It might be a sort of sour 
note to celebrate your first long 
weekend of the year, but it should 
be an enjoyable show nevertheless.
The Truman Show
Wednesday, September 6 
1012
Jim Carrey is always more fun 
in dramatic roles. Here, he plays 
a man who has grown up in a 
completely fake world — his life is 
the most popular television show 
on earth, with 24-hour coverage 
thanks to an entirely phony 
town swarming with actors and 
thousands of hidden cameras.
As the movie progresses, Truman 
discovers the true nature of his 
world and tries to escape. It’s an 
absolutely fantastic, moving film.

To our first-years: Chinese crime 
movies are a staple in McConomy. 
They’re always cool and definitely 
something different to experience. 
This one is about a woman who 
plots revenge against the man who 
betrayed her and sent her to prison. 
You get all the fun of a revenge 
movie with the colorful backdrop of 
life in China! What could be better?
Cars
Friday, September 8 
7:301012:30
Pixar films are famous. Very, very 
famous. Like, so famous that 
almost every kid on the planet 
worships them. Cars, Pixar’s most 
recent outing, stretches reality 
further than before, with a world 
populated with anthropomorphic 
cars. As typical for any Pixar 
movie, it’s filled with a veritable 
bevy of celebrity voice work 
and gorgeous visuals. That’s 
about all this one has going for it
— apparently people have trouble 
forming emotional investments 
with animated automobiles.
V For Vendetta
Saturday, September 9 
7:30 10 12:30
The Wachowski brothers have 
met with a lot of geek ire for the 
disastrous two Matrix sequels. 
However, their treatment of a 
dark British graphic novel, V for 
Vendetta, redeemed them in many 
people’s eyes. At its core this 
film is about fighting “the man,” 
though it does so by creating 
a sympathetic main character 
who is, essentially, a terrorist. 
Regardless of its questionable 
moral ground, V for Vendetta is a 
beautiful movie that’s anything but 
your typical action flick, and it just 
might make you want to start a 
revolution.
Stranger than Paradise
Sunday, September 10
8 1012
A movie about slackers and 
hipsters is nothing new, but this is a 
movie about siackers and hipsters 
made before they were “in.” It’s 
your typical tale of worlds colliding, 
unlikely friendships, and spur-of- 
the-moment road trips, but this time 
it’s done on a shoestring budget 
with characters who actually feel 
like real people. Sounds like a great 
way to spend an easy Sunday 
night, before all the classwork starts 
piling up.

Orientation 2006
Made from the best stuff on earth
Like the Staples commercial says, coming back to school 
may be the most wonderful time of the year. While first- 
years may be wishing for the reality of college to start, 
many upperclassmen long for the worry-free nature of 
Orientation to come back, and to stay — Orientation is, 
after all, made from the best stuff on earth.
From moving in to Playfair to Convocation to Carnegie 
Games, Orientation is packed with things that may or 
may not represent the rest of your life at college. Hopefully 
everyone who participated had a good time, hopefully 
no first-years are jaded quite yet, and hopefully the 
Orientation high will last at least another couple of days.
The beginning of the year is the best time to try a myriad 
of new things. Maybe you did some service projects like 
painting the windows at the Children’s Hospital or picking 
up trash, maybe you painted the Fence, or maybe you 
mustered up enough nerve to talk to someone. No matter 
what you managed to squeeze into your Orientation 
experience, you should make an effort to continue being 
involved on campus — it’s the best way to continue to be 
happy at college.
At Carnegie Mellon, you can easily hide in the shadows 
and survive contentedly... but that’s a waste of time. You 
have just entered a four-year period of your life where 
you can mix learning with nearly limitless independence, 
freedom, and fun. Remember to mix in some fun with your 
classes. Don't be afraid to try new things, food, or people. 
Defeat the Carnegie Mellon stereotype and party.
Just back... away... from the computer.

Where the Pittsburgh music scene is...
Three of the city’s music venues offer something for everyone when it comes to music
It was about one year ago today when I found myself more 
ticked off than I had been in quite some time. Like many, I 
had just moved to Pittsburgh to start my budding career as a 
first-year at Carnegie Mellon. Move-in was sweaty, orientation 
was a whirlwind, and the meals in Baker Tent were spotty. 
Despite all the rush of being away from home, there was 
still one thing getting to me: Where were the concerts? The 
answer took some time to find, but, believe it or not, the city 
of Pittsburgh has some great places to see music. Here are 
three standout venues you must visit while you're here.
Mr. Small’s Theatre
Who knew that Pittsburgh's hottest music spot would actually 
be an old church? Mr. Small’s fits around 650 at capacity, 
creating a great opportunity to see your favorite bands up 
close. Because of its small size and sexy hardwood floors, Mr. 
Small’s also has great acoustics. It is the stopping point not 
only for alternative and "indie” rock groups but also hip-hop, 
jazz, and jambands, too. Audiences at concerts represent an 
amusing amalgam of hipsters and hippies, jocks and punks. 
This past year saw performances by They Might Be Giants,
Keller Williams, Ghostface Killah, Galactic, OK Go, The Misfits, 
G. Love and Special Sauce, and many, many others.
Manchester Craftsmen's Guild
Although Pittsburgh has plenty of local jazz to soak up in 
places like Dowe’s on Ninth (located in downtown Pittsburgh) 
and Gullifty's (located in Squirrel Hill), "MCG" is the hotspot 
for world-famous jazz musicians. MCG has made Pittsburgh 
a hard-to-miss city for touring jazz musicians. Big names 
like the Dave Holland Quintet, Dave Brubeck, and the Derek 
Trucks Band have all made their way through MCG in 
recent years. Last year I was lucky enough to see Terence 
Blanchard here and was amazed by the great acoustics of the 
auditorium. Unfortunately, this auditorium-style setup makes 
it less intimate than your average jazz club. In addition, the 
average age of MCG audiences is far older than your average 
jazz club; many concertgoers here are well into their 40s 
and 50s. Finally, despite the fact that MCG organizes many , 
concerts throughout the city, only 12 events are scheduled 
at MCG this year, making trips to MCG relatively infrequent 
(though always worth it). The great music and fabulous sound
make you forget about its problems.
Garfield Artworks
Garfield Artworks was a pleasant surprise when comparing 
it to New York City venues. Although the Big Apple has its 
share of music venues, movie theaters, and art galleries, 
it’s rare to find a place where all three fuse into one entity. 
Located on the venue-heavy Penn Avenue, Garfield Artworks 
has live concerts of underground groups (mostly national, 
but the occasional local group), art exhibitions, and movies. 
Unlike MCG, Garfield Artworks attracts a young crowd of high 
schoolers, college kids, and young adults alike.
Sure, the Pittsburgh music scene isn’t world-renowned, but 
it’s often underestimated. These venues are havens for some 
of the finest music in town and they give Pittsburgh the 
cultural boost it so desperately needs.

...and where it isn’t
If you're looking for a free-for-all event, don’t bother with the Post-Gazette Pavilion
Going to see the Allman Brothers Band is a rare treat, and it’s 
one you should probably try to get each summer. Seeing the 
Allman Brothers Band and Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers 
on the same night is an opportunity that might not present 
itself again for quite some time. The two bands recently 
finished their summer run together on August 18 at the 
Tweeter Center in Camden, N.J., but not before playing the 
Post-Gazette Pavilion in Burgettstown, Pa.
Radio announcements informed fans that the $35 lawn tickets 
had completely sold out a few days before the August 16 
show. Pavilion seat tickets were still available the night of the 
show, and the box office service fees brought the total price 
to about $90. Tickets were extremely hard to come by, and in 
fact were selling for well over their face value.
It was easy to make friends in the parking lot before the 
concert. It turned out that many of the night's concertgoers 
had failed to find tickets, and decided to just tailgate instead. 
Parking was a good bit cheaper than buying a ticket, and the 
parking lot was loaded with cheap food, beer pong, and other 
fun things to do. During the intermission, I contemplated 
buying a $7 beer inside the pavilion, but after a fruitless 
search for a water fountain, I settled for a $3.50 bottle of water 
instead. The tailgate seems like a good alternative and a good 
way to save money in comparison.
The Allman Brothers Band played an incredible set. As I found 
my way into the large amphitheater, the Allman Brothers were 
in the midst of a screaming rendition of “Don't Want You No 
More," and as I got to my seat under the pavilion roof, they 
had started directly into “Not My Cross to Bear." Derek Trucks 
was making his guitar sing and wail, as usual.
Post-Gazette Pavilion is a curious place. The lawn was 
hopping and dancing during the first set, particularly for the 
band’s covers of “Into the Mystic" and “The Weight." The 
place really lit up for renditions of "In Memory of Elizabeth 
Reed" and the closer, “Southbound.” I had a strong desire to 
get a little closer for the encore, and because I had a ticket for 
a seat in the pavilion, I expected no trouble going in. But as 
the band began "Midnight Rider,” I couldn’t help but to just 
dance right up the aisle and find some empty seats on the end 
of the row.
To my shock and amazement, I found I was disturbing some 
concertgoers behind me by standing and dancing. It seemed 
the woman behind me couldn’t see, and I got the impression 
she expected me to forfeit my right to dance. What I couldn’t 
understand was how anyone could manage to stay in their 
seat during the explosions of sound taking place on stage — I 
couldn't keep myself still! Not long later, I was accosted by 
an usher and dragged from the pavilion. It seemed he was in 
agreement with the older lady behind me. At Post-Gazette 
Pavilion, the right to view the band while remaining in your 
seat overpowers your right to dance and move about.
What was still worse was the usher who removed me. He 
was getting really angry at this point, grabbing my arms 
and dragging me away as I tried to continue dancing. The 
supervisor, who we were happy to have the opportunity to 
speak with, explained to me in a hostile tone that we were 
dancing in the wrong place.
By the time Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers took the stage,
I was pretty worn out and frustrated. I couldn't believe that 
the employees of the venue would be so strict about the
rules as to actually stop fans from dancing. All in all, I’d say 
that the rules of the venue, and the way I was treated by its 
employees, were a major detractor from the concert itself.
I went from the extreme of joyful, uncontrollable dancing 
during the Allman Brothers Band to sitting dejectedly during 
Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.
During his set, Tom Petty announced, "Someone backstage 
just told me that this is the most people that’s ever been in 
this place." It comes as no surprise to me that Post-Gazette 
Pavilion had never managed to sell out the venue in the past.
If it had not been for the phenomenal lineup of two popular 
and talented bands playing in the same night, it seems they 
would have continued in that failure. The venue reminds 
me of a theme park: Like Six Flags, Post-Gazette Pavilion 
is outrageously overpriced; everything from parking and 
admission down to beer, food, and bottles of water deals a 
major blow to the pocketbook. Furthermore, the regulations at 
the venue seem to protect stuffy old folks who just want to sit 
around from fans who want to dance and cut loose.
This year's Allman Brothers show at Post-Gazette Pavilion 
was one of the best I’ve ever seen, and getting a dose of the 
Heartbreakers was just the icing on the cake. However, Post- 
Gazette Pavilion is not one of my favorite places to see a show 
in Pittsburgh. I don't think I’ll be returning until I’m a boring 
old fart who's tired of dancing and prefers sitting on his big fat 
wallet all night instead.
