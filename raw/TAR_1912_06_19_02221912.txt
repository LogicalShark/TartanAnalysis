STILL MISSING—ONE BABY.
Search Still Going On for the Car­
negie Celebrity.
When the report was made as to 
the progress in the search for the 
first Tech baby it developed that this 
elusive child was still missing. Sev­
eral individuals had entered children, 
not their own, in the race for the 
title, but as for unearthing the REAL 
ONE—nothing doing. The usual 
manner in which these dark horses' 
were entered was something like this. 
,Some individual would slide up and 
say, “I see that you are looking for 
the first Tech baby.”
“You bet we are. Have you got 
it?”
At which the individual would go 
red and green by turns, sputtering the 
while that he thought so-and-so had 
him or her, as the case might be. The 
name was carefully jotted down and 
the wheelg started whereby we might 
determine the validity of the claim 
entered.
One fellow came along and tried 
to enter the name of a child born not 
two months ago and when we laughed 
at him he offered to bet us “a darn 
good dinner” that he was the win­
ner. Since we took him tip we are 
more desirous than ever of finding the 
real Tech baby.
One thing unearthed was that to 
Mr. and Mrs. William C. Stevenson 
goes the double honor of having the 
first set of twins. They have this 
field to themselves so far as we have 
been able to determine. The proud 
father was graduated with the Class 
of 1908, the charter class of the insti­
tution, and is a mechanical en­
gineer, working at the Isabel furnaces.
Another member of the same class, 
Mr. Elmer L. Schumacher, was also 
entered by his admirers but was 
promptly disqualified. He was mar­
ried two or three days before he grad­
uated and is therefore out of the race. 
It never pays to try and beat the 
gun.
The other names handed in are un­
der investigation and the results will 
be announced in next week’s issue.. In 
the meantime the search will go mer­
rily on, all assistance being thankfully 
received.
SENIOR BALL.
The Prom has passed.
The ball is yet to come—and was 
started rolling on its way last Thurs­
day evening, when the committee in 
charge held their first official meet­
ing.
Start . saving now, that you mdv 
provide for the future.
If you don’t dance, learn. You have 
four months in which to become pro­
ficient.
A TRIP TO THE CANAL 
By the 
American Institute of Electrical En­
gineers.
Prof. vVurts Tells of Trip.
Through the courtesy of Colonel G. 
W. Goethals, Chairman and Chief En­
gineer of the Isthmian Canal Commis­
sion, exceptional opportunities were 
offered Institute members and their 
guests to inspect the Canal.
We sailed from New York, Jan­
uary 17th, on the steamship Almirante 
of the United Fruit Company. The 
temperature was of the zero ki^d. We 
plowed our way out of New York 
harbor through great slabs of ice. The 
water pipes in the ship were frozen 
and everybody looked miserably un­
comfortable and cold.
January 18th. Less cold, beautiful 
weather. In Gulf stream about xnoon. 
One man forced the season a little 
by appearing on deck in white flannel 
trousers *and tennis shoes.
January 19th. Delightfully warm. 
Had athletic sports on deck and fun 
for all. Prizes were purchased from 
the barber, and presented to the win­
ners by Doctor Humphreys, President 
of Stevens Institute.
January 20th. Another beautiful 
day with water a little rough. As a 
result some failed to appear at the 
usual meal hours. Some looked un­
happy while others were positively 
grouchy. At 8 P. M. passed San Sal­
vador, first landing of Columbus.
January 21. Sunday. Pretty warm 
but with a delightful breeze. Doctor 
Humphreys led a short service with 
good pinging in the reading room. 
In the evening we rounded Cape Mai- 
si, the eastern point of Cuba.
January 22nd. Breakfast at 6:30. 
Jamaica in sight. At 8 we anchored 
in front of the Tichfield Hotel, Port 
Antonio, a wonderfully picturesque 
spot. The natives are very black. The 
women do most of the work. They 
carry heavy burdens on their heads 
which are lifted to that position by 
the unspeakable lazy men. The wo­
men even break stones in the quar­
ries and on the roads. After break­
fast at the hotel, we drove five miies 
through a beautiful tropical country 
to the Blue Hole, an unimportant but 
quite a romantic spot. Small boys 
climbed the cocoanut trees for us, the 
milk of which we thought we enjoyed. 
In the afternoon, a special train took 
us over the mountains, the peaks of 
which rise 7,000 feet from the sea. 
We passed through twenty-eight tun­
nels, through great banana and cocoa- 
nut plantations and many picturesque 
villages on our way to Kingston 
where we again met the ship. Here 
we remained until 2 P. M. next day 
spending our time in drives and shop­
ping, but there was little to buy ex-

WESTINGHOUSE COMES FROM 
BEHIND.
In a truly remarkable contest, the 
Varsity five went down to defeat last 
Saturday night before the Westing- 
house team on our home floor. The 
lack of weight told on our boys and 
they could not maintain the pace 
which they started early in the game. 
As the game progressed it became 
rougher and the heavy Wilkinsburg 
team had things coming all their way 
in the last period of play.
The game started with unusually 
poor team work and shooting on the 
part of both teams; the game was 
scoreless for fully seven minutes, even 
the referee loafing on the job. Then 
a foul on holding was awarded our 
team, Colvin missing the free throw. 
Immediately afterward Kesselman 
took the ball from a scrimmage in one 
corner of the floor, and, much to his 
own amazement and the delight of the 
spectators, scored the first goal. As 
if to profit by the little guard’s ex­
ample, Colvin scored two clean bas­
kets on long shots in quick succes­
sion. On his second free throw from 
the foul line he made one point more. 
Then began a session of team work 
and shooting seldom, if ever, equalled 
on the home floor. For" all of the 
effect of their presence, the Westing- 
house team might as well have been 
absent. In ten minutes after the 
start of the game the score stood 14 
to 0, in our favor. Then Lyford 
scored on a foul goal, and his team 
mates came to his assistance. J. Brown 
and C. Brown each annexed two field 
goals, while Lyford scored on every 
one of his five attempts at fouls. In 
the meantime, our boys had not been 
idle, and the half ended 20 to 13 for 
Carnegie Tech.
The second half started at a rapid 
pace, but the Plaid five could not cage 
the ball on any of their many at­
tempts. On the other hand, the West- 
inghouse team showed a big improve­
ment in team work and an almost un­
canny ability on the part of their for­
wards to make the ball pass through 
the net. All of their goals were made 
on comparatively long shots and luck 
was a considerable element.
After the game, the spectators were 
treated to a short dance, Eddie Mc­
Kee furnishing the music with the aid 
of the piano.
The line-up was:
Car. Tech.—22. Westinghouse—35.
R. Williams.......F.....................J. Brown
Yahres ................F..................... Lyford
Colvin ...............C.................... Hansell
Heisel ................G................_.C. Brown
Kesselman .....G......................... Butt
Substitution—Hall for Heisel.
First Half—Field goals—Colvin 4, 
Williams 2, Kesselman 2, Yahres, J. 
Brown 2, C. Brown 2. Foul goals—

THE PROM.
The 1912 Promenade has passed and 
in the passing has left a mark which 
it will be hard for any Prom of the 
future to exceed.
After the overture and several se­
lections which completed the concert 
program, dancing began at 9:30 and 
continued until 3:30. There was thirty 
dances on the list, with a supper 
dance, and supper midway.
The menu was excellent and showed 
great care in the selection.
The music rendered by Gounod’s 
orchestra was probably the best ever 
rendered at a Carnegie function.
There was but one shocking feature 
during the whole evening and that 
was the electricity with which parts 
of the floor and walls were charged. 
You might touch a charged portion 
yourself, or again your partner might, 
and you feel the same effect. This 
merely added to the enjoyment of the 
evening.
The new arrangement of the Schen- 
ley makes it an ideal place for such 
an affair. Last year the booths were 
scattered about, the edges of the ball 
room floor, making much of the floor 
area unavailable for dancing. It was 
also necessary to promenade in the 
public lobby and to pass through the 
lobby to reach the supper room. But 
now there is added a promenade at 
one end of the ball room which is en­
tirely separated from the public. Here 
the booths were built and the few 
minutes between dances pleasantly 
spent. At the other end of the ball 
room from the promenade there is di­
rect communication to the supper 
room.
After the supper dance the ninety- 
eight couples present, composed of 
Juniors, Seniors and Alumni, formed 
in a' grand march, marching round and 
round the ball room, first in twos, 
then fours, eights, and finally sixteens 
abreast. Supper was then served.
The patronesses of the evening were 
Mrs. Joseph Buffington, Mrs. Andrew 
Carnegie, Mrs. Samuel H. Church, 
Mrs. Clifford B. Connelly, Mrs. Fred 
Crabtree, Mrs. George H. Follows, 
Mrs. A. A. Hamerschlag, Mrs. Joseph 
Hames, Mrs. S. S. Keller, Mrs. John
H. Leete, Mrs. Henry McGoodwin, 
Mrs. W. E. Mott and Mrs. N. Trinks.
Members of the Faculty present 
were Director A. A. Hamerschlag, 
Dean John L. Leete, Dean Clifford
B. Connelly and Professors Janies, 
Crabtree, Follows and Hornbostle.
One member of the Board of Trus­
tees was present, Judge Joseph Buf­
fington.
The decorations were in Japanese 
cherry blossoms, Carnegie Plaid and 
Fraternity colors.

STUDENT BEHAVIOR IN 
PUBLIC.
A clipping from the Wilmerding 
“News-Tribune,” concerning the be­
havior of a group of students, sup­
posedly from Carnegie, while in that 
town, has been called to our atten­
tion. We have read the article with 
much interest, not to mention the ac­
companying disgust, and are glad to 
say that we are unable to recognize 
any of the characters depicted there­
in. We trust that the reporter was 
mistaken when he connected such in­
dividuals with this institution. There 
can be, nevertheless, a strong lesson 
drawn from this article, one which it 
is always well for the student-body 
to have in mind.
The article in question was headed, 
‘‘Fresh Kid Leader—Carnegie Tech 
Students Tnvaded Wilmerding.” It 
states that a crowd of students, led by 
a small student called “Tommy,” vis­
ited several of the restaurants in Wil­
merding, and acted in a manner totally 
unbecoming to a gentleman or to 
a student from any institution of 
learning. We will not go into the de­
tails of the story as it appeared in 
the paper. Whether the statements 
made in this article are true, we have 
been unable to determine, but this fact 
does not hinder our drawing a les­
son from it. Students or groups of. 
students when in public should con­
stantly bear in mind the fact that 
they carry not only their own repu­
tations but that of the institution of 
which they form an integral part. 
They should therefore be most care­
ful that their actions are such as to 
bring no discredit upon themselves 
nor upon the institution which is fur­
nishing them with an education. They 
should remember that around their 
slightest misstep a reporter can build 
an article for publication which will 
not only prove harmful to themselves
and their Alma Mater but to the 
cause of general college education. 
Such articles are too common and 
have much to do with the prejudice 
against colleges that exists in many 
quarters. Many such stories when 
carefully investigated are found to 
be without foundation or to be gross­
ly exaggerated, being based upon the 
acts of those whose nearest approach 
to a college was a trip to a sporty 
tailor. Needless to say, there is in 
every college a certain few whose acts 
are not all that could be desired and 
who are a constant menace to the 
honor of the college of which they 
happen to form a part. Should it be 
found that -the rowdies mentioned in 
this Wilmerding article have by mis­
take obtained admission to Carnegie 
we should like to see them summarily 
dismissed. They have no part in our 
life. As for the rest of us, let us re­
member in the future to be more care­
ful than ever of our actions while in 
public.
—o—
The Tartan begs to call to the at­
tention of its readers the article by
Wallace G. Imhoff, ’09 Science, ap­
pearing elsewhere in this issue, in
which the conditions at the Univer­
sity of Wisconsin and Carnegie are 
contrasted in a most able and in­
structive manner. We believe that 
it will prove interesting to every
member of our student-body. This 
article was written by Mr. Imhoff at 
our request, and it is the hope of The 
Tartan that it will be the first of a 
series of such articles.
THE INDIVIDUAL TOWEL SYS­
TEM.
As an institution such as ours 
grows, it becomes more and more 
strikingly like a municipality in the 
extent and variety of the problems it 
presents for satisfactory solution to 
those in charge. It requires that the 
questions of heating, ventilation, sani­
tation, not to mention a host of othei 
problems, be met and solved so as 
to give the best service to the great­
est number. And, just as in a munici­
pal government, the ultimate success 
of the project depends upon the citi­
zen units, so in our case it depends 
upon the students. If we do our duty 
as it is required of us there can be 
no question as to the ultimate success 
of any reforms instituted, or of the 
fulfilling of the purposes for which 
the municipality was founded. In our 
case all of this should be of easier ac­
complishment than in a regular city 
government by reason of the higher 
average of intellect we are supposed 
to possess. That this is not always 
the case is well shown by the follow­
ing example.
The Department of Hygiene recom­
mended to the Director that in the 
place of the present roller towels now 
used, individual tpwels be substituted. 
Accordingly the matter was given a 
trial with the following results. At 
nine o’clock in the morning of the day 
selected, two thbusand individual tow­
els were placed in the Machinery Hall, 
Science, and Industries Buildings, the 
roller towels being removed. By 
three o’clock all of this vast number 
•of towels had been used and soiled.
When they were collected and count­
ed it was found that one hundred and 
ten were missing. To say the least, 
this was discouraging. It is no small 
expense to supply such a large num­
ber of students as we have enrolled 
with individual towels, even when 
they are properly used and returned. 
To supply them at the rate at which 
they were used on this one day would 
cost several hundred dollars a month, 
much more than could be reasonably 
spent for such a service. It was a 
clear case of some of the individual 
citizens of our community disregard­
ing the rights of their fellow members 
because the cost of this loss was thus 
thrown upon the general treasury. For 
the towels missing there was nothing 
for the officers to do but to charge the 
expense of replacing them up to the 
general breakage fee, a thing disagree­
able to all parties concerned. It was 
thought at first that the results pre­
cluded the adoption of the individual 
towels as suggested by the Depart­
ment of Hygiene. It has been de­
cided However to give the matter 
another trial and, beginning with next 
month, individual service will be sup­
plied just so long as the students 
show by their use of it that they ap­
preciate the step taken for their con­
venience and comfort and are willing 
to do their share by the proper and 
economical using of the towels. Of 
the desirability of the individual 
towel service, nothing need be said. 
The Tartan sincerely trusts that each 
student will see to it that he shows 
a regard for the general weal and 
makes this reform a permanent one.---------o---------
ITEMS OF GENERAL INTEREST.
In his lecture last week, Captain 
Robinson said that he had one Car­
negie man working for him at Wash­
ington. That man is Ross B. Ham­
mond, ’09 Science.* * *
Mrs. Florence Kelley, of. New York, 
Secretary of the National Association 
of the Consumer’s League, gave a 
very inspiring and interesting lecture 
to the M. M. C. S. girls on Friday.
With Mrs. Kelley were Mrs. W. 
W. Card, whose guest Mrs. Kelley is; 
Mrs. Cornelius Scully, President of 
the Local Branch, and Miss Sidney 
Colestock, the Secretary.* * *
A committee from the Milwaukee 
Board of Education visited the build­
ings one day last week. This com­
mittee, together with their architect 
and contractor, are visiting all build­
ings devoted to education in order to 
obtain ideas for the new high school 
they are to build.* * *
Whitney S. Hamnett, ’08 Science, 
has been placed in charge of the Texas 
>ffice of the Pittsburgh Testing Lab­
oratory located at Dallas. He has 
been connected with this office for 
some little time and his promotion
will be a source of pleasure to his
many friends in Pittsburgh, i * * *
Great doings are planned for the 
laying the corner-stone of the new 
Design Building. The work of break­
ing ground has gone along very rapid­
ly when the state of the ground is
considered and the prospect of soon 
getting into their new home is very 
pleasing to the architects.* - ‘ * *
It was a true welcome that was ac­
corded Dean West when she returned 
to M. M. C. S. after her illness. The 
student-body are always glad to have 
the Dean back again after an absence, 
be it ever so short.

Miss Freeland gave the Juniors and 
Plebes of M. M. C. S. a swimming 
party at the Pittsburgh Natatorium. 
The girls all had such a good time 
that they decided to form a swim­
ming cluu.

THE TARTAN3
M. M. C. S.. JUNIOR “PROM.’
The Junior “Prom.” is over now 
and we are gradually settling down 
to good hard study. It has been said 
that “anticipation” is better than 
“realization,” but the realization of 
the Junior “Prom” is something which 
will never be foregotten, especially 
by the class of “1913.” Everyone was 
rushed at the last minute, as is usu­
ally the case with any great event, 
but everything went smoothly in the 
evening.
In the receiving line were Miss Jean 
llorrigan, the class Secretary; Mrs. 
i ermorken, who acted in F> — - West’s 
place, and Mrs. Hamerschiag.
The school was beautifully deco­
rated with Southern greens and Spring 
flowers and was the scene of much 
gaiety. It certainly was great fun 
dodging around the musicians and the 
punch-bowl in the corridor. The 
punch, by the way, was very popular 
both as a beverage and a subject of 
conversation as everyone tried to 
guess the contents of it.
After dancing until we felt faint 
pangs of hunger all descended to the 
“Faculty Parlors” for “eats.” At the 
upper end of the hall was a table re­
served for the Chaperons and Fac­
ulty.
The dance started again even more 
strenuously than bei’ore, with “Cupid 
Tell Me Why.” We would like to 
know very much what it was that the 
person wanted Cupid to tell him.
The twenty-eighth dance came all 
too soon and we then retired to put 
on our wraps. Suddenly wild shrieks 
filled the air and loud lamentations 
were heard on every side. The cause 
for this unseemly noise was easily 
seen, or rather could not be seen for 
the lights had all gone out. Someone 
shouted “The candles in the dining­
room.” And so the candles were 
brought to the rescue.
It certainly did look funny to see 
the girls dressed in their party capes 
holding a lighted candle in one hand 
and a slipper bag in the other and 
wandering around like Diogenes’s 
looking for honest men.
Thus ended the Junior “Prom” and 
we all departed with the feeling that 
we had had the time of our lives.
UNIVERSITY OF PITTSBURGH 
CELEBRATION.
Faculty Invited to Attend.
The Faculty are invited to attend 
the exercises held in connection with 
the celebration of the 125th birthday 
of the University of Pittsburgh. These 
exercises are open to members of the 
Faculty, no ticket of admission being 
required.
On the forenoon of Wednesday, the 
28th, an address will be given on the 
Progress of Higher Education since 
1787, and honorary degrees will be 
conferred.' In the afternoon a brief 
historical sketch of the University 
will be given and addresses will be 
made by representatives of a number 
of the colleges and universities. All 
of these will be of special interest to 
the Faculty.
The play to be given by the stu­
dents at Carnegie Hall on the evening 
of the 27th should prove very inter­
esting. Those uesiring tickets can ob­
tain them at the door or in advance 
by writing to the secretary.
MUSICAL CLUBS.
As Superintendent of the Newsboys 
Home, I want to thank the manage­
ment and members of the Carnegie 
Tech Glee and Mandolin Clubs for 
the delightful concert given Saturday 
evening, February 10th. That the 
boys thoroughly enjoyed the music 
and songs is evidenced by the remark 
made by one of them after the con 
cert, “Gee, dose guys can sure play 
and sing some.” Come back again 
at any time. You will be welcome.

THE THISTLE.
The Thistle Board was very much 
gratified by the ready response of the 
entire student body of the four 
schools, both for the material and 
subscriptions. Judging from the 
quantity and quality of the grinds and 
sketches, the Board can well assure 
everyone that this year’s book will 
far surpass any previous Thistle in 
its comic section. Special mention 
must be made of the night classes for 
the interest they have shown, which 
fully justifies the work of the night 
men and women on the Board.
In all, over six hundred subscrip­
tions were paid in to the business 
manager, which fully justifies the 
Board in ordering an edition of nearly 
seven hundred books, which is one 
hundred more than has ever been or­
dered before. Exact figures will be 
published next week.
Mr. Evans, Art Editor of the This­
tle, has received a great number of 
drawings, sketches and pictures, most 
all of which are very good. Judg­
ment will be made on all drawings by 
a jury composed of Professors in the 
Design School, and a member of the 
Thistle Board, and the announcement 
of prizes will probably be made in the 
next issue of the Tartan.
The Thistle Board have held meet­
ings on last Saturday, Monday, Wed­
nesday and Thursday of this week, 
and are doing all in their power to 
have the book ready for distribution 
the first week of April.

Pastor—I was so sorry for your wife 
during the sermon this morning, Doc­
tor. She had such a dreadful fit of 
coughing that the eyes of the whole 
congregation were fixt upon her.
Doctor—Don’t be unduly alarmed. 
She was wearing her new hat for the 
first time.—Fliegende Blaetter.
It is with a great deal of regret that 
we tell that Prof. Mott is still very 
ill. The pneumonia has left him, but 
bronchial trouble still holds him bed­
ridden. However, if he continues to 
progress as rapidly in the future as 
he is progressing at present, we may 
hope to see him about the Schools 
by the middle of March. We extend 
our earnest wishes that he have even 
an earlier recovery.

CAMP CARNEGIE.
It is proposed to begin active use 
of the Camp Louise Carnegie for in­
structional purposes this spring. De­
tails of the arrangements for the hand­
ling of students will be worked out 
by the different deans.
In the meantime, in order to be pre­
pared for the opening of the building 
season, the Director is taking prelim­
inary steps, in various directions to 
avoid delay in actual operations.
Among these may be cited the pro­
posed plan to offer a competition for 
a prize of $50 to the students of the 
School of Applied Design to compete 
for one designed frame house or bung­
alow; one designed brick house or 
bungalow; one designed concrete or 
stone house or bungalow. The first 
of these competitions will be for the 
frame or shingle house. It is hoped 
that every student in the Department 
of Architecture will enter this com­
petition, not alone for the amount of 
the prize, but because of the pride the 
future students will have in knowing 
that these structures are the result of 
student competition.
After the designs have been finally 
selected the students of the School of 
Applied Industries will be requested 
to complete the necessary working 
drawings and the students of the 
Building Construction Course will be 
expected to erect these buildings at 
some future date.

The total earnings of students work­
ing their way through Columbia Uni­
versity between June 1st, 1910, and 
May 1st, 1911, were $75,709.45. The 
employment report just published at 
| the University says in part:
“There is the greatest opportunity 
I for tutorial work, under which head- 
| ing are included, besides private tu- 
j tors, teachers, companions for boys, 
j and other work of the same nature.
I There was an unusually large demand 
I for proctors during the last year but 
| this was rather exceptional. Next in 
| the list came the demand for sales- 
j m«n. 136 men were placed in posi- 
! tions of this sort, most of them for 
a considerable period of time. Many 
students obtained employment in this 
way every Saturday and some of the 
others worked a number of evenings 
each week. 114 men obtained clerical 
work, including addressing and sim­
ilar work. About 50 students found 
employment as stenographers, and 
students coming to the University 
| with a knowledge of stenography and 
| typewriting will find it particularly 
easy to get something to do.”

cept Panama hats, curios and very 
black smoking tobacco which is made 
into a continuous rope and coiled up 
on benches in the market. It is sold 
by the yard, more or less. (I have 
a half yard which I will give to any 
one who will agree to smoke it all.)
January 23rd. Sailed at 2 for Colon.
January 24th. Choppy sea, head 
winds, games on deck, lovely moon­
light night.
January 25th. Docked at Colon at 
10 A. M. Drove about town for an 
hour but there was little of interest 
to see. The natives are black and 
dirty looking. The town is situated 
on low swamp land which has been 
filled in and well paved by the United 
States Government. Colon (Colum­
bus) merges into Cristobal (Christo­
pher) at the Atlantic entrance to the 
Canal. At 3:30 we left on our special 
train for Panama. On the way we 
caught glimpses of the great Gatun 
Dam and the Culebra Cut. We passed 
through small villages, saw many na­
tive huts an^d hovels, but the country 
is not beautiful. The jungle has been 
cut away, leaving only a second 
growth. The blasting and bustle of 
a great undertaking has driven away 
the beautiful tropical birds and little 
monkeys. One- sees now only a great 
canal, huge machine shops, busy lit­
tle towns, men and trains going and 
coming, mighty cranes, great diggers, 
power houses, cement works, dust and 
smoke. In fact, parts of the Isthmus 
were not unlike Pittsburgh on a hot 
summer day. At Panama we were 
comfortably housed at the Tivoli 
Hotel.
January 26th. At 8 A. M. a special 
train took the party through the Cule­
bra Cut which is now within 35 feet 
of bottom. We were taken on the 
work tracks while engineers of the 
Canal accompanied us to explain the 
important features. We inspected the 
great shops at Gorgona, lunched at 
Empire, where back at the hotel at 4 
and then took a beautiful drive 
through the hospital grounds on An­
con Hill, overlooking the Bay of Pan­
ama.
January 27th. Special train at 8 A. 
M. Colonel Goethals met us and 
shook hands with all. We inspected 
Gatun Dam, one mile long, one-half 
mile thick at base, and nearly com­
pleted. This dams the Chagres River 
which will form the great Gatun Lake, 
23 miles long. It will take two wet 
seasons to fill it. Inspected the great 
Gatun Locks. In the evening the 
Tivoli Club gave us a beautiful dance 
at the hotel, most of the people being 
dressed in white.
January 28th. Sunday. A special 
train and two large tugs took us to 
Taboga Island for the day. This is 
situated in Panama Bay, about 12 
miles from the city. It is a lovely 
spot with a quaint little village perch­
ed under the brow of the mountain 
flanked with pineapples, for which the 
island is noted.
January 29th. A special train at 8 
for Pedro Miguel and Miraflores locks 
and dam. In the afternoon we drove 
to old Panama, a prosperous city in 
the days of the Spanish Main, de­
stroyed by Pirate Morgan, and since 
overgrown with great vines and trees.
It is certainly a romantic looking spot. 
In the evening, we gave a return dance 
to the Tivoli Club.
January 30th. Special train at 8 for 
Ancon Quarry. In the afternoon we 
visited Balboa, the Pacific entrance to 
the Canal. We advanced about three 
miles with our tugs and on the banks 
saw many of the old French dredging 
machines now worthless and over­
grown with vines.
January 31st. Special train at 8.
Inspected the Atlantic division of the 
Canal and the intersection of the 
French and American Canals.
Lunched at the Cristobal Hotel of the 
Commission. A much needed rest was 
taken in the afternoon.
February 1st. Sailed for home.
In passing from the Atlantic to the 
Pacific side, the Canal maintains a sea 
level for nine miles, then rises through 
three successive locks into the Gatun 
Lake, 85 feet above sea level. The 
channel now leads 23 miles across 
this lake to a stretch of nine miles 
on the same level through the Culebra 
Cut where the descent is now made 
through three successive locks, and 
then a nine-mile stretch leads to the

open sea to the Pacific. It is expected 
that the Canal will be ready to pass 
ships from ocean to ocean by July,
1913. In 1915, the year of the final 
opening, it is proposed that the 
American Institute of Electrical En­
gineers again make this trip and pass­
ing through the Canal attend their 
international Convention at the Expo­
sition in San Francisco.

GROVE CITY TAKES SECOND.
Grove City won the game with the 
Varsity at the Field House, Thurs­
day, February 15, by a score of 33 to 
23. The game was closely contested 
urtfil the last few minutes of play, 
when the visitors scored three field 
goals and two fouls in quick succes­
sion.
Capt. Williams played a star game 
throughout, but at times lacked the 
necessary support that wrould have 
taken the game. Kesselman was an­
other stellar performer. Gibbons was 
the only man to do anything remark­
able for his team, scoring six field 
goals. Davis performed his duties as 
referee in a commendable manner.

A New Economy.
As a direct result of investigations 
carried on last year by the United 
States Department of Agriculture, a 
new plan has been put into prac­
tice with regard to the sale of odd 
lengths of lumber. It was formerly 
the custom to sell lumber in even 
lengths only; waste resulted from 
cutting off the ends of odd lengths 
to make them even. A considerable 
percentage of a sawwmill’s output is 
defective; that is, boards have knots, 
decay, spots, or split ends, and the 
defective parts are cut out. To make j 
an even length of what remains, it is ! 
often necessary to cut off a foot of 
good wood with the bad, and it is 
wasted. The practice of marketing 
odd lengths as well as even is in­
tended to lessen this waste. It will 
frequently lessen waste in the woods 
also; for example, a log may be cut 
fifteen feet long which, following the 
old custom, would be cut only four­
teen, and the extra foot would be 
left in the woods.---------o---------
Operative.
Dr. Cyrus L. Cotler, the well- 
known Springfield surgeon, is a mem­
ber of the Colonial Club, an institu­
tion that fines its members for talk­
ing shop.
Dr. Cutler, getting out of his motor­
car, entered the Colonial Club the 
other day for luncheon, and, advanc­
ing into the restaurant, said to a law­
yer, as he took off his goggles:
“Well, old man, how are you?”
The lawwyer got Dr. Cutler fined 
then and there for talking shop.
The next day, when he arrived at 
the club again for luncheon, and sur­
geon, angered at what had happened, 
cut the lawyer. The fetter then had 
him fined once more.—New York 
Tribune.

No Rest.
“George,” she asked, “if we were 
both young and single again, would 
you want me to be your wife?” 
“Now, my dear,” he absent-mind­
edly replied, “what’s the use of trying 
to start a quarrel just as we have set­
tled down to enjoy a quiet evening?”
Sherman’s Inspiration.
The Chinese prototype of the Sher­
man Antitrust Law is beautifully brief 
and simple. It contains but four para­
graphs, which are as follows:
“Those who deal with merchants 
unfairly are to be beheaded.
“Those who interrupt commerce are 
to be beheaded.
“Those who attempt to close the 
markets are to be beheaded.
“Those who maintain the prosper­
ity of commerce are to be rewarded.”
CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied Science—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied Design—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied Industries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec­
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher-
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School—For women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be­
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night Courses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

6THE TARTAN ?
PROF. WILLETT SPEAKS AT 
FULCRUM CLUB MEETING.
New Officers Elected.
The Fulcrum Culb held its regular 
monthly meeting on Wednesday, Feb­
ruary 14, in Room 401. The first part 
of the evening was taken up by the 
election of officers for the second 
semester, and the discussion of old 
and new business. The results of the 
election are:
President—L. Middleman.
Vice President—N. A. Hollister.
Secretary—H. R. Auerswald.
Treasurer—J. P. Steward.
The discussion held regarding the 
furnishing of the club room creates 
the hope that the Commercials will 
soon have their quarters in a present­
able shape.
Prof. Willett was asked to speak on 
the organization and object of the 
Commercial Engineering course. The 
substance of the lecture was an anal­
ysis of the course itself and of the 
conditions under which the training 
that it affords will be especially pro­
fitable to graduates.
It is a common mistake, said the 
speaker, to think that this course pro­
duces educated salesmen. Salesmanship 
pne of the many openings, and though 
it may be the means it is not the 
end. There are three distinct phases 
of engineering, viz., designing, pro­
duction and commercial engineering. 
The latter two are covered in the 
commercial engineering course. The 
course is founded upon the undeniable 
fact that there is a distinct demand 
for men with such a combined train­
ing, as it affords. The greatest possi­
ble amount of time is given to pro­
duction engineering; in fact, twice as 
much as in the mechanical engineer- ] 
ing course. The course embraces vari-1 
ous subjects of various commercial 
and technical bearing. If it is desir- | 
able for a designing engineer to have | 
more than a one-sided, though thor­
ough, training, it is positively essen- | 
tial that a commercial engineer should 
have besides his technical training a 
broad knowledge of things in general.
As an example, Prof. Willett took 
the case of an American firm intend- j 
ing to send a representative to South 
America, where, of course, he will ! 
have to meet the competition of for­
eign manufacturers, more especially 
Germas. If they send a man with a 
purely technical training, he will 
doubtless conduct things the wrong | 
way. If they send a commercial man, 
he will be unable to maintain himself 
against the eternal “Made in Ger­
many.” It needs no further comment 
to show that this is one of the places 
for the commercial engineer.
Prof. Willett's speech was appre­
ciated by every one present, and was 
followed by a general animated dis­
cussion of the subject. After several 
questions had been answered, the 
meeting adjourned and a light lunch­
eon was indulged in.

SECOND THURSDAY MORNING 
LECTURE ON BATTLESHIP 
CONSTRUCTION.
Like a Wool Schedule.
“Shan’t I play you the woolen-un- 
derwear record?”
“Is that the name of the piece?” 
“No, we just call it that because it 
sounds so scratchy.”—Houston Post.
Last Thursday morning Capt. Rob­
inson, of the U. S. Navy, continued 
his lecture on battleship construction, 
this time going more into the details 
connected with the design and the 
construction of a battleship. He ex­
plained what requirements were made 
by the government, and what was left 
to the judgment of the designing en­
gineer concerning speed, shape, cost, 
armanent, draft, etc. He also dis­
cussed the various methods employed 
to assure trim, strength, steadiness 
and stability to the vessel, and touched 
upon American and English practice 
regarding hull construction and 
launching.
The model of the battleship North 
Dakota, which had been brought from 
Washington to illustrate Capt. Rob­
inson’s lectures, and which has been 
exhibited for ten days in Room 209, 
was removed shortly after the lecture 
to be used elsewhere. It is hoped 
that nobody failed to avail himself of 
this opportunity to become familiar 
with the details of its equipment.
There is a marked tendency in the 
minds of authorities to include in the 
conception of an engineering educa­
tion the idea that an engineer, what­
ever his chosen specialty may be, 
should have at least a superficial 
knowledge of many things which do 
not directly concern his line of work. 
This idea, which has been carefully 
fostered by our institution, has again 
been applied to the series of Thursday 
morning lectures scheduled for the 
School of Applied Science. Consid­
ering the lectures that have been de­
livered already, together with the 
names of the prominent men that afe 
yet to speak to us, it is hardly possible 
to think that there is anybody who 
will not benefit by them.

THE TARTAN7
INTERESTING LETTER RE­
CEIVED.
Imhoff, ’09, Writes to Tartan From 
Wisconsin.
An interesting letter was received 
by The Tartan and is printed in Jull 
below. The writer, Wallace G. Im­
hoff of the Class of 1909 Science, is 
now a student at the university of 
Wisconsin and in his letter contrasts 
conditions there with conditions here. 
We feel that all the members of the 
student-body will enjoy reading this 
letter.
Mr. Imhoff mentions the matter de­
gree granting and voices the senti­
ment of all parties concerned. We 
deserve and desire the power to grant 
degrees» Steps are now being taken 
by the Director to secure a charter 
by Commencement and while nothing 
definite can be announced at this time, 
it is hoped that by the next issue of 
The Tartan a statement as to the 
progress made can be given.
The letter from Mr. Imhoff is given 
below.
Dear Mitchell:
Your letter of the 4th has been re­
ceived and I wrill be only too glad 
to say a few words in regard to col­
lege life at Wisconsin. As an old 
University it should rank far ahead of 
Carnegie and yet I find a great number 
of things in which on coming right down 
to cold facts Carnegie is not far be­
hind. I do not believe any other col­
lege in the country can give a better 
Metallurgical Engineering course than 
is given at Carnegie. I find when up 
against men of the same age, that I 
can hold my own with any of them, 
and in so far as I have met fellows in 
that line of work they certainly have 
not had a better technical training. I 
feel very, very well satisfied with the 
training received w'hile at Carnegie.
In what way is Wisconsin then a 
great university and what is there 
which makes it rank about fourth 
with the great universities of the 
country? It is perhaps due to two 
things, probably more. Wisconsin is 
known all through the West and Mid­
dle West for its excellent Geological 
and Agricultural Departments. Two 
of the foremost geologists of the coun­
try, President C. R. Van Hise and Dr. 
C. K. Leith, have charge of the Geo­
logical Department and both stand 
at the head in scientific world. The 
Agricultural Department ranks with 
the first in the country. These two 
features can then be assigned among 
the foremost for establishing the high 
name that the University of Wiscon­
sin now holds.
One thing I find here which pro­
motes college spirit is a University 
Store, known as the Co-operative As­
sociation. It costs $2.50 to become 
a member, which is for life, and then 
on everything bought there a discount 
of 10 per cent is given. This means, 
of course, that most of the students 
buy their supplies there and the re­
sult is a typical line of college goods. 
All kinds of college pennants, posters, 
and knick-knacks are kept always on 
hand. I believe such a store would 
be of very good advantage also at 
Carnegie. It’s the pennants, pillows, 
posters, and the like, which most col­
lege men like and especially the 
Freshmen are proud to be able to dis­
play them. Why not have cuff links 
with the C. T. S. monogram on, a 
neat stick pin and necktie clasp to 
match; why not have all sorts of nifty 
pennants, blankets, pillows, all kinds 
of snappy hat pins, watch fobs, spoons, 
etc. I know the first answer will be 
we can’t sell them. Try getting good, 
substantial things, and see if they 
don’t sell. Not imitations or anything 
cheap, but solid gold and silver but­
tons, pens, etc., and the boys and 
girls will jump at the chance and be 
proud to wear them. This seems prob­
ably like a small matter, but after all 
they are the things which put into a 
man the true love for his Alma Mater. 
One of the snappiest ideas here at 
Wisconsin is the typical Wisconsin 
belt. Nine out of every ten men wear 
the belt and it serves to identify Wis­
consin men no matter where they are. 
No matter where you are if you show 
one of those belts it brings you a 
friend. I would like to see something 
like this started at Carnegie, an ordi­
nary belt, of leather like a harness 
strap and a brass or plain ’clasp 
buckle on which is printed Carnegie.
In regard to the college paper I 
have sent a copy of the Daily Cardinal. 
This is a sixteen-page newspaper, pub­
lished daily by the students, of the 
University. Besides this daily paper 
there are at least five monthly pub­
lications. - Of course, all these things 
only come with time and growth in 
student body.
Hazing has been entirely abolished 
here within the last two years. Class 
honors are all settled almost entirely 
by athletic contests. There is a stu­
dent court which handles all offenses 
committed by students and they are 
brought to trial with judge and jury 
in the usual way, the student being 
allowed to have witnesses and prove 
or fail to prove his guilt.
One of the interesting things at 
Wisconsin is the great interest taken 
in winter sports. Being excellently 
situated, one can skate, go toboggan­
ing, ice boating, skiing, or enjoy many 
other winter sports. The toboggan 
goes a quarter of a mile down over 
a steep hill onto the lake and one 
usually attains speed enough to go 
at least half a mile out on the lake.
Football, baseball, track, etc., are 
the same, only on a larger scale. I 
am of the opinion personally that 
as far as spirit at football games that 
Wisconsin has nothing on Carnegie 
in that respect. Good football yells 
and college songs are at a premium. 
Each year prizes of $25 are offered 
for the best songs and yells. This 
seems to me would be an excellent 
thing for Carnegie to do, we need a 
good tvpical Carnegie song, such as 
Fair Harvard for Harvard, Boola 
Song of Yale, On Wisconsin, a good 
typical, snappy march, which sticks with 
the college man, and which on the first 
note sends a quiver and awakes a 
smoldering fire of enthusiasm. I 
imagine the feeling of a man quietly 
eating his dinner in Boston and out 
of the medley suddenly comes “On 
Wisconsin” with its typical college 
scoring and notice every one join in 
by a whistle or the like even though 
they haven’t the faintest idea as to
the name of the tune. But a rush like 
fire in his veins and a quiver from 
head to foot goes through the Wis­
consin man in the corner. He un­
consciously sees the step, step, step, 
even, regular, of the band before him, 
sees the boys lined up, and hears the 
good old yells of perhaps years and 
years ago. This is what we want, 
we want that quiver for Carnegie, and 
to get it, it must be set at a premium; 
in other words, some sort of contest 
must be put up year after year till 
finally the typical song is unearthed.
Before closing, there is one thing 
I want to speak of which has been 
one and the only keen regret I have 
in regard to my college life at Car­
negie. It is of vital importance and 
I think should be given first consid­
eration with regard to the future of 
the men leaving Carnegie.
“Did you say you were a graduate 
of the Carnegie Technical Schools?” 
“Yes, I graduated there as a Metal­
lurgical Engineer in 1909.”
“What degree did you get?”
“Oh! I didn’t get any, but they will 
be giving degrees soon I think.” 
“Well, what kind of a school is that 
that you don’t get a degree, it can’t 
rank very high.”
This has been a conversation I have 
carried on time and again. With hu­
miliating apology I have been forced 
to explain what I have done at Car­
negie and then not been, given credit 
for the work done there. To be ex­
plicit I will cite my actual case. Com­
ing here to Wisconsin I was asked 
where I came from and what work 
done. As usual the above conversa­
tion took place.
Well, they said, “You have nqthing 
to show for the work done. We can’t 
let you try for a Master’s Degree 
when you have not a lower degree. 
The actual result has been two years 
lost as far as that parf of my college 
life is concerned. This year I should 
be working my first year for a Doc­
tor’s Degree, but instead just grad­
uated as a Bachelor of Science. I 
don’t care what anyone says about 
degrees, they do have significance, and 
it has certainly been very humiliating 
to say I have graduated from an in­
stitution and then go on to explain 
why I have nothing to show for it.
There is one of two things should 
be done, one is that on entering the 
Schools every man should have the 
fact brought clearly in front of him, 
that he will receive no degree; the 
other is for the heads of the institu­
tion to try to Jthe last effort to ob­
tain as soon as possible such a course 
of studies that on completion those 
having done the work satisfactorily 
shall receive degrees. I am positive 
every graduate feels this regret as 
keenly as inyself and I wish some of 
the Alumni - would also express an 
opinion concerning the same. It 
doesn’t make any difference how much 
I explain I have nothing to show for 
it and get treated accordingly. I’d 
go up against any man with the foun- 
lijn I got at Carnegie; I couldn’t 
have gotten a better education in any 
other institution in the country. She 1 
deserves the credit and not Wiscon- j 
sin, but you can see which one will ! 
get the credit when I get my B. S. 
here this year. This should be looked
into as soon as possible; Carnegie 
deserves the credit and should have 
it.
Yours very truly, 
WALLACE G. IMHOFF, ’09.

A BUSY ANECDOTE.
A private soldier once rendered 
some slight service to the first Napo­
leon.
“Thank you, Captain,” said the Em­
peror, carelessly.
“In what regiment sire?” was the in­
stant response of the quick-witted 
private.
“In My Guards,” replied the Em­
peror, pleased with the man’s retort.
This incident, with appropriate vari­
ations, also happened to Genghis 
Khan, Ivan the Terrible, Attila, Gus- 
tavus Adolphus, Louis XIV., Charle­
magne, Alexander, King Alfred, 
Xerxes, Richard the Lionhearted, and 
Henry of Navarre.—Success.

8THE TARTAN
j “WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW.” j
Did you know there was a faculty 
basket ball team? Any member of 
the first-aid-to-injured-intellects corps 
with a full set of teeth is eligible. 
It now proudly enrolls the venerable 
instructor in English, Mr. Lightner, 
the aged but still vigorous Mr. Dor- 
weiler, from the Darkest Africa of 
Mathematics; a piece of heavy ord 
nance (known familiarly as Uncle 
Joe) so full of electricity that he may 
shock the. spectators at times; Tiny 
Tex. from everywhere; Mr. Cullough, 
who goes in merely to see that no­
body is rude to the little Texan; Dr. 
Marks of the physiological secret serv­
ice; Mr. Lightcap, the back to nature 
expert, and Mr. Dosey, the proprietor 
of the punitive foundry tub.
The first six are traveling life’s cin­
der path “light,” that is, without any 
domestic excess baggage. Being with 
out fear and without corns they are 
truly terrible in action. At the end of 
the game a small physical deficit like 
a missing eye IL ear leads to no com­
plications at home and hence lends 
a delicate charm to the exercise. One 
member of this fleeing (we mean fly­
ing) squadron has been heard to re­
mark with deep feeling, that he seems 
to have exhausted all the atmosphere 
in the gym during the first five min­
utes of play and there is a palpable 
vacuum so far as his lungs are con­
cerned thereafter.
The games with the students are 
perpetrated under Roberts’ Rules of 
Order and Newton’s Laws in general. 
The following special regulations have 
been appended thereto by common 
consent.
I. No student in contest with the 
Faculty shall “dribble” the ball with­
out permission from the Dean.
IT. Before a student may deprive 
a member of the Faculty of possession 
of the ball, he must present a petition 
to the Director and have at least two- 
third C’s.
The writer witnessed a recent con­
test and was so filled with emotion 
and the fumes of honest perspiration 
that he breathlessly recorded the fol­
lowing details.
The riot started with Captain Light­
ner at center and the others at the 
circumference. At the first toss up: 
the heroic captain utilizing a provi­
dential hole in the kimono of his op­
ponent for toe hold, leaped mightily 
and secured the ball in his digital 
quotation marks. With fluency he 
parsed (passed, of course) the sphere 
to Mr. Lightcap, who modestly re­
tired with it to a secluded corner, but 
almost immediately returned with the 
triumphant announcement that its 
diameter was 10.132 inches. Where­
upon the Faculty were given two 
points and the game went merrily on. 
The exchange of courtesies became 
fast and furious and when Mr. Dor- 
weiler w'as heard by the officials to re­
mark, Oh, fudge! he was at once 
warned.
At this point the game w'as inter­
rupted by a prolonged dispute. Tiny 
Tex. had inadvertently tossed his op­
ponent thro the basket and claimed a 
goal. The claim was eventually disal­
lowed, but a foul was called on the 
vicarious basket ball for tearing the 
basket as he went thro.
After play had been resumed it was 
discovered that Mr. Dosey’s oppon­
ent, a towering youth of five feet six, 
had borrowed a ladder from Hunter 
and was making despairing but futile 
attempts to extricate the ball from 
Dosey, who was contentedly playing 
solitaire with it at the basket oblivious 
to the heroic efforts of his antagonist 
down on the surface of the earth.
When the frantic applause of the 
gallery had subsided, Mac established 
his long suit from the other end of 
the floor and wound up beneath the 
goal in a refined “cross-ruff” with 
Captain Lightner. The latter in his 
excitement dropped the sphere into 
the convenient mouth of Hunter, who 
was yawning in polite ennui on the 
side line. The game was called be­
cause the victim refused to cough up 
the circulating medium, altho Tiny 
Tex. protested that the fact of the 
ball being in Hunter’s midst was no 
obstacle to a continuance of the game 
as it was obvious that if Hunter were 
thrown thro the basket, he would have 
to take the ball with him. Tea was 
then served.
TRACK MEN OUT.
Now that the weather has moder­
ated track aspirants are reporting for 
practice in droves. The new out-door 
board track affords the best place in 
the city for training, situated as it is 
just outside the Field House. In or­
der to inform those not familiar with 
the new track, we give a few of the 
detail?. It is elliptical in shape with 
a length of one-tenth of a mile; it is 
banked at the ends at such an angle 
that the corners may be taken at any 
speed; it is six feet in width at every 
point; and it affords a straight away 
of fifty yards. It is also said to be the 
only one of its kind in the country, 
and new tracks will probably be mod­
eled after it.
Two indoor meets will afford fol­
lowers of the sport opportunities to 
size up prospects. P. A. A. will en­
tertain at Duquesne Garden March 9, 
and a dual meet with Westing- 
house Club will be held one week 
later, March 16. A prelim­
inary meet will be run thorugh at 
the Field House next week to select 
the entries for these meets.
INDOOR BASEBALL PRACTICE.
Spring is near; so is baseball sea­
son. Saturday morning the first in­
door practice was held in the gym. 
For two hours the aspiring, perspiring 
baseball men worked the kinks out of 
their arms and struggled with ground­
ers from the bats of Coach McCul­
lough and Capt. Vail. The new men 
were in the majority. Prospects are 
that last year’s varsity men will have 
to put up a strong game to hold their 
places this season.
The opening game is only seven 
weeks distant. This means the hard­
est kind of work to get into condi­
tion. Cigarettes are taboos and early 
hours will be the rule from now on. 
The men who come out and work con­
sistently will be the men who will 
represent Carnegie Tech on the dia­
mond. Do not wait until out-door 
practice begins—it will be too late. 
Come out now; get into the game.
Practice will be held in the gym the 
following days each week until the 
field is in shape for outdoor work: 
Tuesday, 4 to 5 P. M.; Thursday, 4 
to 5 P. M.; Saturday, 9 to 12 A. M.
Ex-Capt. Bill Moorhead declares 
that his Charley horse is entirely well. 
He covered the initial sack in his 
freshman year, but was out of the 
game most of last season. It is good 
news to hear that he will be in the 
game this year.

C. E. LECTURE.
‘The Survey of Property in Pennsyl­
vania.”
‘‘The Survey of Property in Penn­
sylvania” will be the subject of a lec­
ture by Mr. Louis P. Blum, assistant 
engineer for the W. G. Williams Co., 
and member of A. S. of C. E.
Mr. Blum worked for several years 
in. thé employ of the City of Phila­
delphia before coming to Pittsburgh, 
and is considered by many to be the 
best man in this city in his particular 
line of work.
The lecture will be given at 8 P. 
M., Saturday, February 24th, at the 
monthly meeting of the Civil Engi­
neering Society in Room 55, Science.
Prior to the lecture will be held the 
election of officers for the second 
semester and the transaction of so­
ciety business. ¦

PARIS PRIZE SKETCH.
The first preliminary for the Paris 
Prize was taken Saturday by some 
thirty students of the School of Ap­
plied Design. Twenty sketches were 
turned in at the end of the twelve 
hours given for the work. The prob­
lem was a very interesting one, with 
the subject, “A Guard-house on the 
Border of a Reservoir. It is to be 
hoped that some places may be given 
to the drawings from this school at 
the judgment in New York on March 
16, but the general mediocrity of the 
sketches make such result doubtful.

THE GAMMA KAPPA HOUSE 
PARTY.
At about four o’clock they came. 
Who? Why, the fair guests of the 
Gamma Kappa Club, of course.. And 
the way they smiled—. If you don’t 
believe it, ask Deck.
Dinner was served at eight in the 
tastefully decorated dining room with
H. J. as master engineer. Indeed, 
much praise is due the Carnegie os­
teopath for his ingenious ideas so ex­
cellently carried out.
At nine-thirty dancing oegan to be 
popular and never before were those 
old floors so exercised. Things moved 
swiftly and easily under the eyes of the 
best chaperon in the world until in 
the excitement of a tag two-step, 
“Blanch” dived into a chandelier. 
Chaos, Egad! But that wras only an 
incident and soon forgotten. Did 
someone say Virginia Ruk were obso­
lete? Well, I guess not. You wouldn’t 
have thought so could you have seen 
Cornelius.
It was away into the wee small 
hours before good-bye’s were said, 
and Mrs. Bingler gratefully thanked 
for the evening.
Most of Friday was a sleepy day, 
but by eight P. M. the girls were all 
dolled up. And who were these girls? 
Well, listen. Miss Mary Moore, Miss 
Jean Miller, Miss Eleanor Reed, Miss 
Rowena Jefferson, Miss Ruth Bark- 
well, Miss Laura Green, Miss Jean 
Cromby and Miss Alice R. McNeil, 
with Mrs. E. H. Bingler, as chaperon.
After waiting about an hour f6r 
Brother Engstrom, as per usual, din­
ner was announced, and it was truly 
an enjoyable affair. Then all set sail 
for the Hotel Schenley and no one 
knew or cared that Weed Brothers' 
product beat an irregular tattoo.
Nothing need be said about the 
Prom? There never was one like it 
and right here we take occasion to 
congratulate the committee and all 
concerned.
Saturday’s theatre party concluded 
the round of Joy days as Deck bid 
his fair lady good-bye he very aptly re­
marked: “Thank goodness, I have a 
nickel for car fare.”
