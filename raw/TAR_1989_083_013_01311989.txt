Senate reaches late compromise
Busy week marked by resolutions, veto, emergency meeting
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
In athree-hour-longemergency 
meeting Sunday night, Student 
Senate arrived at a tentative 
decision regarding the formation 
of a student committee to provide 
input on President Cyert’s suc­
cessor.
The verdict followed a week of 
controversy provokedby aresolu- 
tion introduced at the regular 
Senate meeting last Tuesday. 
That resolution, brought up by 
H&SS Senator Matt Ruben, criti-
cized Student Government Presi­
dent Andy Robitshek’s method of 
forming the student search com­
mittee.
During the week, the Senate 
resolution elicited responses from 
the Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC), the English Student Advi­
sory Committee, and a veto from 
Robitshek himself. Sunday’s 
emergency meeting ended the 
week of debate with a tentative 
plan which most Senators feel 
will be fully implemented tonight.
Last week The Tartan reported 
thatRobitshekhadselected seven
“large organizations” — Activi­
ties Board, Council of Fraternity 
Presidents, Panhel, SDC, Spirit, 
Student Senate, and The Tartan 
— which each nominated one 
memberofthepresidential search 
committee from within its ranks.
Robitshek also chose Kishore 
Rao, a sophomore ECE major and 
former Student Senator, to chair 
the committee. Rao and Robitshek 
are both brothers at Theta Xi.
The Board of Trustees has yet 
to appoint a student to sit on its 
steering committee which will 
consider a “short list” of candi­
dates for the presidency and make 
a final recommendation on the 
next president, but Robitshekhad 
suggested that the Board appoint 
Rao.
At the Tuesday Senate meet­
ing, Ruben introduced a resolu­
tion urging that the current stu­
dent search committee be dis­
banded, and that a new commit­
tee be selected. The proposed 
committee would have contained 
representatives from all four 
undergraduate colleges, Spirit, 
the Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
(GALA), the Asian Student Asso­
ciation, Women for Women, the 
Greek System, and SDC. Repre­
sentatives would have been 
openly nominated from the stu­
dent body and selected by Stu­
dent Senate.
The proposed committee would 
have selected a chairfrom its own 
ranks to sit on the presidential 
search steering committee.

controls a lot, and I think the 
choosing of a new president is 
perhaps the most important thing

Greeks discuss 37 percent 
kickback of activities fee
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
An anonymous proposal outlining a 
plan for a 37 percent kickback of Greek 
activities fee money to the Council of 
Fraternity Presidents and Panhel has 
circulated among the Greek system.
Changes in the proposal and strate­
gies to implement it were discussed dur- 
ingaclosed CFP session Thursday night.
Currently, each full-time student pays 
a $40 activities fee each semester. Ac­
tivities fee money is controlled by Stu­
dent Senate and used to fund organiza­
tions such as Spirit, Kiltie Band, the Gay 
and Lesbian Alliance, WRCT, The Tar­
tan, and the Activities Board.
The Greek proposal, which calls for a 
37% kickback of the activities fees paid 
by about 1300 greeks, would result in a 
reduction in Senate’s budget of over 
$38,000 annually, an amount which 
totals almost 9% of the monies available 
to activities-fee sponsored organizations.
The Graduate Student Organization 
already receives 37% of all graduate 
student activities fees, a policy that was 
set a number of years ago with the ra­
tionale that graduate students gener­
ally do not participate in undergraduate 
activities. This year, Senate kicked back 
an estimated $58,000 to GSO.
“While a few of us are members of 
some campus organizations, the vast 
majority of us are not members of any
"The vast majority of us 
are not members of any 
other campus organiza­
tion
— Anonymous proposal
other campus organization, and our use of 
the activities fee is limited mainly to cam­
pus films, lectures, and Spring Carnival 
events,” the proposal says.
“I think it’s probably a good idea,” Kappa 
Sigma President Alex Bacus said. “A lot of 
Greeks don’t fully utilize the amount of 
money they spend.”
The author of the proposal recommends 
that the returned money be used to elimi­
nate house dues to CFP and Panhel. Re­
maining funds, the author recommends, 
should be used “to pay for the activities and 
events that Greek organizations do as com­
munity service events."Currently, Student 
Senate supports some charitable Greek 
events.
“It’s not ready to be presented to any­
body,” Bacus said. “There are a lot of things 
to be ironed out on what to do with the 
returned money.... The decision on how 
much is to be kicked back is also somewhat 
arbitrary.”
“We’re going to make some changes,”

Administration reviews Freshman Camp program
By SUSAN GALLAGHER
Tartan Staffwriter
The growing concern over whether fresh­
man camp divides or segregates the fresh­
man class has led certain members of the 
administration to closely examine the 
future of the three-day event preceding 
on-campus orientation each year.
Vice President for Enrollment William 
Elliott voiced concern in a memo to Dean 
of Student Affairs Brad Walter by indicat­
ing that “If the 1989 plans continue to 
include a ‘camp’ experience, then the en­
tire class should be included.”
Elliott is not alone in his point of view — 
Walter and a number of students indi­
cated their agreement.
Freshman camp has been considered 
valuable to many people as the first expe­
rience of college life, and some of those 
that don’t attend feel that they miss some­
thing. Lauren Boice, a junior voice major, 
didn’t attend the camp portion of fresh­
man orientation, and indicated how she 
felt about missing camp. “When I came 
here, people talked about freshman camp 
experiences, and I didn’t have any to talk 
about with them.”
Liz Sherlock, a junior English major
who also didn’t attend camp, agreed with 
Lauren: “I lived with upperclassmen off- 
campus, and I felt like if I had gone to camp 
I would at least have known some people.” 
Of course, not all freshmen feel that miss­
ing freshman camp means missing a valu­
able experience.
When asked if not attending camp made 
him feel “left out,” Bill Matson, a CIT fresh­
man and ROTC cadet, said “Notreally. ROTC 
has its own orientation, so it wasn’t like I 
had just walked onto here [campus] and 
didn’t know anyone.”
Many ideas are being considered by the 
administration for possible alternatives to
freshman camp in the upcoming years. 
Among these are a cruise on the Gateway 
Clipper, a Pirates game, or white-water 
rafting.
Due to the large number of factors in­
volved in the decision, it is not clear 
whether camp will be preserved or 
whether another, possibly more inclu­
sive, alternative will be chosen.
Regardless of what the final decision 
may be, one point was made clear by 
Walter. “One half of the students who 
had the camp experience come back and 
meet with those who haven’t, and this 
creates a problem.”

Strep breaks out at CMU
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
For the past two weeks Carnegie 
Mellon has had a significant increase 
in the number of student cases of 
strep throat.
During October and November the 
Health Center recorded an average of 
one to three strep cases per week. 
According to Health Center Director 
Anita Barkin, these are typical num­
bers at CMU.
But two weeks ago the Health Cen­
ter began seeirtgthree to five casesper 
day. Last week, the rate jumped to 
eight to ten per day. Barkin said that 
other local schools have noticed a 
similar increase in the number of strep 
cases they are seeing.
The Health Center has not been 
able to determine any pattern among 
the people who have developed strep 
throat. No housing areas or classes
appear to have been hit significantly 
harder than others.
Barkin described the symptoms of 
strep throat that students should be 
aware of. They are: fever greater than 
101 degrees Fahrenheit, difficulty 
swallowing, swelling in the tonsils, 
white pus spots on the tonsils, and 
swollen lymph nodes. Strep throat is 
also characterized by a sudden onset 
of symptoms and the lack of a cough.
Untreated, strep throat has the 
potential to cause more serious medi­
cal problemsincludingrheumaticfever 
and kidney infection. In order to pre­
vent these complications and keep the 
spread of the disease under control, 
Barkin advises students who believe 
th ey may h ave strep throat to go to the 
Health Center for throat cultures as 
soon as symptoms appear.
She pointed out, however, that strep 
throat should not be considered an

Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Tax change for employee tuition 
benefits; University to give refunds
Since January 1, 1988, the Internal Revenue Code has 
required that tuition benefits received for graduate and 
undergraduate courses taken at institutions other than 
CMU (Tuition Assistance benefits) as well as CMU graduate 
courses (Tuition Remission benefits) be treated as taxable 
income for federal and social security tax purposes.
Section 127 of the Internal Revenue Code previously 
allowed up to $5250 per year as nontaxable income for these 
benefits. The section expired on December 31,1987,and was 
renewed in November 1988 to be effective January 1,1988 
through December 31, 1988. However, when Section 127 
was reinstated, it was revised to exclude from taxable 
income tuition for undergraduate courses only.
In the absence of Section 127, the University treated 
Tuition Assistance and Graduate Tuition Remission bene­
fits as taxable income (e.g., federal and social security taxes 
were withheld on these benefits). Since Section 127 was 
reinstated, employees’ W-2s do not reflect undergraduate 
Tuition Assistance benefits as taxable income.
In the next few weeks, the University will be refunding 
social security taxes on 1988 undergraduate Tuition Assis­
tance benefits. .Depending on individual tax circumstances, 
employees may receive a federal tax refund when they file 
their income taxes as well.
Chess computer wins prize
Deep Thought, a computer chess machine built and pro­
grammed by five members of the School of Computer Sci­
ence, has won t^he Fredkin Intermediate Prize for Computer 
Chess, a $10,000 award for the first computer to reach 
international ipaster status.
Deep Thought has maintained a rating of more than 2,500 
on the U.S. Chess Federation scale for 25 consecutive games 
in open chess competition. Its rating of2,545 places it among 
the top 30 human and computer chess players in the United 
States. World Champion Gary Kasparov of the Soviet Union 
is rated at more than 2,800.
The Deep Thought team, which is sharing the prize money, 
includes graduate students Thomas Anatharaman, Mike 
Brown, Feng-Hsiung Hsu and Andreas Nowatzyk. The fifth 
member, Murray Campbell, recently became a Computer 
Science faculty member.
LaPaglia offers car safety tips
Because of one car theft and another attempted theft on 
campus last week, Director of Security James LaPaglia has 
issued the following tips for car owners to protect their 
vehicles from most thieves.
•Lock the doors and close the windows.
•Hide valuables so they will not tempt thieves.
•Record the car’s license plate number and vehicle identi­
fication number.
•Report suspicious events and people to Campus Police.
Cyert names computer committee
Carnegie Mellon President Richard Cyert has appointed a 
committee to study ways in which CMU can improve its 
computer systems in the next five to ten years. The commit­
tee will study many aspects of the computer system but will 
concentrate on network issues in particular.

Earthquake hits 
Soviet villages
MOSCOW (AP) — An earth­
quake destroyed several moun­
tain villages in Tadzhikistan last 
Monday, causing a landslide that 
buried one under a 30-foot wall of 
dirt and mud, officials said. Pre­
liminary estimates put the death 
toll at 1,000.
“Almost everybody died,” said 
Zainiddin Nasreddinov, editor-in- 
chief of the official Tazhiktan news 
agency, who visited the buried 
village of Sharora in Soviet Cen­
tral Asia.
After the quake, a wall of dirt 
and mud slid from a nearby hill 
and buried Sharora, he said.
“Everything is destroyed — all 
the homes, the schools, the hospi­
tals and clinics, the stores,” he 
said.
A government commission that 
began work Monday morning
made a preliminary estimate of 
about 1,000 dead, Nasreddinov 
said. Later estimates were low­
ered to 274 deaths.
Latin America 
looking to Bush 
for assistance
RIO DE JANEIRO (DJ)—Latin 
American nations are pinning 
hopes of alleviating their huge 
debts on U.S. President George 
Bush, but economic deterioration 
and political radicalization still 
seem likely to accelerate in the 
region.
The problems of Latin America 
worsened under Reagan.
Peru, bankrupt and racked by 
terrorism, is ripe for upheaval. 
Argentina and Brazil, wallowing 
in economic difficulties, face elec­
tions this year that will test the 
countries’ tenuous democratic 
institutions. Even two tradition­
ally good debtors, Venezuela and 
Colombia, have decided to limit 
their payments.
“We must sharply reduce the 
stock of debt through strong ini­
tiatives that take account of the 
secondary-market valuation of 
our debt. We have been moving 
too slowly,” says Brazilian Fi­
nance Minister Mailson Ferreira 
da Nobrega. He urged creation of 
an international agency, financed 
by industrialized nations, that 
might buy back debt in secondary 
markets and pass on the discount 
to the debtor.
This is one of the ideas being 
pushed by newly formed Group of 
Eight — including Brazil, Mex­
ico, Argentina and Venezuela, the 
region’s four biggest debtors. They 
have also called for World Bank 
guarantees for programs to allow 
debtors to swap their debt for 
bonds either with a discounted 
face value or below-market inter­
est rate.
Iraq may have 
biological weapons
BONN (DJ) — Sensitive to 
charges it dragged its feet on dis- 
closure of West German involve­
ment in a Libyan chemical weap. 
ons plant, Bonn said it has vague 
indications to support a U.S. 
charge that Iraq has the capabil. 
ity to produce biological weapons.
But Wolfgang Schaeuble, Chan­
cellor Helmut Kohl’s chief of staff, 
insisted that there is no evidence 
that West German researchers or 
industrialists are involved. He 
was responding to a West Ger­
man television report that claimed". 
German scientists had parties 
pated in an Iraqi project, said to, 
be a laboratory south of Baghdad. 
Former U.S. Secretary of State 
George Shultz disclosed the Iraqi- 
biological weapons capability last 
week but didn’t accuse West 
Germany of complicity.

High court strikes 
down affirmative 
action law
WASHINGTON (DJ) — The 
Supreme Court, in a major blow 
to affirmative action, has ruled 
unconstitutional a Richmond, Va., 
program that requires a portion 
of city construction funds be 
awarded to minority-owned busi­
nesses.
A federal district court in 1984 
and appeals court in 1985 upheld 
the plan. But in 1986, the Su­
preme Court ordered the appeals 
court to reconsider its decision.
On reconsideration, the appeals 
court last July struck down the 
Richmond plan, ruling that an 
affirmative action requirement 
could only be implemented if there 
were evidence that the city, itself, 
had discriminated in the past. 
The Supreme Court affirmed the 
appeals court ruling last Monday 
by a 6-3 vote.

Army experiments 
with mini-laser
NEW YORK (DJ) — The Army 
is experimentingwith a miniature 
high-power laser that soldiers 
could carry into battle. It’s called 
“Dazer.” Its mission: to blind 
enemy night-vision and other 
optical equipment.
The principle is simple: flash a 
high-energy light beam into the 
lens of infrared or other supersen­
sitive sight gear and the equip­
ment— and its user—is blinded. 
The Army said Dazer could cause 
permanent human blindness, de­

viewed.
Resolution against 
gas tax introduced
WASHINGTON (DJ) — Rep. 
Glenn Anderson (D-Calif.) has 
introduced a Sense of the House
resolution expressing opposition 
to the idea of raising the federal 
excise tax on gasoline for the 
purpose of helping to reduce the 
federal budget deficit.
Sense of Congress resolutions 
have no legal force, even if passed 
by one or more houses. Rather, 
they are used to signal sentiment.
Anderson’s resolution is co­
sponsored by about 60 other 
House members.
Explaining his resolution, 
Anderson said excise taxes on 
gasoline and diesel fuel are sen­
sible measures when the proceeds 
are used for transportation pur­
poses. “However, when used to 
reduce the deficit, motor fuels 
taxes are harshly regressive, geo­
graphically inequitable and 
damaging to the economy,” he 
maintained.

Policy on student search committee sparks flurry of debate
Volumle83 aron ,Is8 g
while we’re here.... For that reason, I 
think the committee should be open to 
a]l students,” Ruben told the Senate.
Ruben’s main criticism of Robitshek’s 
committee was the way he organized it: 
“[Faculty Senate Chair John] Fetkovich 
told me that he didn’t work on the com­
mittee with Andy Robitshek aside from 
giving it to him and saying, Here, do 
something with this.’ What’s come out of 
this is that the president of student 
government devised this committee with 
some advice from somebody in the office 
of the Vice President for Enrollment.”
Robitshek, who was not present at the 
Tuesday Senate meetingbecause of class, 
claimed that the organizations were 
chosen after a conversation he had with 
Fetkovich and Steven Fenves of Faculty 
Senate on January 16 at the Faculty 
Senate office. Furthermore, Robitshek 
saidthathe, Fetkovich, and Fenves had 
¿memo from the office of Vice President 
for Enrollment when they formulated 
the current committee.
Fetkovich said he didn’t know if he 
spoke to Ruben or not, but confirmed 
Robitshek’s statement. “Somebody did 
call me asking about getting put on the 
committee, and I told him that the stu­
dents were making that decision,” he
aid. “But Steve Fenves and I were con­
sulting with the students and advising 
them.”
Tuesday, Spirit President and newly-
elected H&SS Senator Nicole Austin 
supported Ruben’s resolution, notingthat 
although Robitshek asked her to nomi­
nate a Spirit member to the committee, 
it had been set up in an “elitist” manner. 
“Sometimes this school runs on the ‘old 
boy network,’ ” she claimed.
Junior English major Claire Rivlin, 
who was present in the audience Tues­
day and introduced herself as “your 
average student,” asked Senate to con­
sider that students who are not involved 
in large organizations may also be inter­
ested in selecting Cyert’s replacement. 
“It is my university. I go here just as 
much as the head of AB, or the head of 
The Tartan, or anyone else in Spirit, or in 
GALA, or in the Asian community.”
After a fifty-minute discussion, Senate 
passed the resolution 18-7 in a roll call 
vote.
Critics oftheSenateresolution charged 
that Robitshek’s committee represented 
campus minorities well. That committee 
contained two women, Keisha Watson of 
Spirit and Debbie Sinn of Panhel; one 
Asian, Bryan Wong of SDC; one black, 
again Spirit’s Watson; and two Greek 
members, CFP’s Mike Barros and 
Panhel’s Sinn. It met only once, on Janu­
ary 23.
Two of the committee members — 
Barros and Wong—were industrial man­
agement majors and therefore had no af­
filiation with any college; all of the other 
committee members represented either
H&SS or CIT.
The only minority group represented 
in the proposed Senate committee that 
was not represented in Robitshek’s com­
mittee was GALA; in addition, the Sen­
ate committee would have contained 
students from CFA and MCS, neither of 
which were represented in Robitshek’s 
committee.
One night after the Senate meeting, on 
Wednesday, SDC metand passed a reso­
lution supporting Robitshek but recom­
mending that a GALA representative be 
added to the current committee. The 
resolution in its final form was authored 
by SDC President Chris Williams, who 
stated later that “it puts SDC on the 
record as expressing an opinion on the 
issue.”
OnThursday, Student Senate received 
a letter from junior Kevin DeYager, the 
chair of the English Student Advisory 
Committee, which was written after 
consultation with at least seven English 
students. “The content of the letter was 
that we agreed with Senate’s decision,” 
DeYager said. “I thought Senate was 
doing the right thing, and people sort of 
agreed with me.”
Shortly before 8:15 pm Friday — the 
deadline imposed by the Student Gov­
ernment Constitution — Robitshek re­
leased his veto of the Senate resolution.
The veto stated that “the first duty and 
power of the Student Government Presi­
dent is that of creating external commit­
tees,” and went on to point out that 
current committee members represented 
“all students” instead of particular or­
ganizations. Finally, the veto claimed 
that “any effort to include all special 
interests will make the committee too 
large and will negatively impact the 
committee’s effectiveness.”
But Robitshek noted in the veto that 
the lack of a gay representative and a 
student from CFA was a legitimate con­
cern, and promised to add students from 
the two groups to the current committee. 
At the time he wrote the veto, Robitshek 
was unaware that his committee did not 
contain an MCS representative. He later 
promised to add one.
“Obviously, there was a lack of com­
munication between myself and Senate,” 
Robitshek told The Tartan. “But I feel 
that what they did was not the right way 
to approach the problem, and that’s why 
I vetoed the resolution.”
Robitshek said that he had asked the 
committee to hold open meetings, and 
that he felt that “the students who want 
to get input to the committee will be able 
to do so."
Although Robitshek has the power to 
ignore Senate if it overrides his veto, he 
promised prior to the Sunday meeting 
that if such were the case, “I will most 
likely carry out their committee although 
I don’t agree with it.”
Responding to Robitshek’s veto, Sen­
ate Chair Glenn Kornbrek called an
emergency Senate meeting Sunday eve2;; 
ning.
Although Kombrek’s power to call an 
emergency meeting is not explicitly 
stated in the Student Government 
Constitution, he claimed Sunday the 
power was given to him implicitly. No 
objections were raised.
After two hours and fifty minutes of 
debate that contained one fifteen-min­
ute recess for informal discussion among • 
its various factions, Senate devised a 
compromise committee.
Although the details will be ironed out 
tonight, the committee will include one ' 
representative each from Senate, Panhel, 
CFP, SDC, GALA, and Spirit. In addi­
tion, one student from each of the four 
undergraduate colleges — CIT, CFA, 
H&SS, andMCS—and a final represen­
tative from the IM department will sit on 
the committee.
The tentative proposal allows the six

Faculty Search Committee holds first open forum meeting
By JAMES B.ENDRES
Tartan Staffwriter
An open forum meeting, the first 
step in the long process of finding 
Carnegie Mellon’s next president, 
was held last Wednesday. About 
40 students,facultymembers, and 
¿dministrators met in Doherty 
Hall 1112 to discuss preliminary 
issues pertaining to the search.
The meeting was opened by 
Steven Fenves, a member of the 
presidential Search Steering 
Committee. He stated, that the 
objective of the meeting was to 
“begin the two-way interchange” 
:of ideas between the search com- 
ittees and the University com­
munity. Fenves introduced the 
moderator of the meeting, John 
Fetkovitch, the current chair of 
the Faculty Senate.
Fetkovitch, chair of the Faculty 
Presidential Search Committee, 
gave the audience some back­
ground on the search. He ex­
plained that President Cyert met 
with the Faculty Senate Execu­
tive Committee in June and re­
vealed his plans to step down.
ccording to Fetkovitch, Cyert’s 
timing gave the committees ample 
lime to begin the search process. 
Over the summer, the Senate 
'athered information about presi­
dential searches at other univer­
sities and made plans.
• Fetkovitch went on to explain 
e current structure of the three
'arch committees. The Presiden- 
'al Search Steering Committee, 
ihaired by Douglas Danforth, is 
charge ofwhat Fetkovitch called 
overall oversight”; a Trustees 
esidential Search Committee, 
paired by Robert A Charpie; and
* Faculty Presidential Search 
¡Committee, chaired by 
. etkovitch, in charge of gather- 
, gnames and information about 
andidates and evaluating them.
As of yet, neither the steering 
committee nor the trustees com­
mittee have met. Also, Fetkovitch 
added that a student committee 
has been appointed by Student 
Government President Andy Ro­
bitshek, chaired by Kishore Rao.
Fetkovitch described Wednes­
day’s meeting as an opportunity 
to gather “inputfrom all elements 
of the campus.” He invited those 
with input to attend further fo­
rums, contact committee mem­
bers in private, or to write.
Fetkovitch explained that there 
are three subcommittees under 
the Faculty Search Committee. 
The University Committee gets 
input from the University; the 
Nomination and Information 
Committee gathers names and 
information on candidates; and 
the Selection and Plans Commit­
tee considers priorities, qualities, 
and criteria to be used in the 
search.
Next, Barbara Anderson, co­
chair of the Nomination and In­
formation Committee, talked 
about what her committee has 
accomplished. She stated that 
advertiseinentshavealreadybeen 
placed in The New York Times 
and the Chronicle of Higher Edu­
cation for the position.
After Anderson, Dana Scott, 
chair of the Selection and Plans 
Committee, toldthe audience that 
his committee is preparing a 
“white paper document” regard- 
ingthe search to be distributed to 
the campus community. He noted 
that although the University 
should be proud of the accom­
plishments of Cyert and his 
administration, the committees 
should concentrate on future goals 
in their search.
University Committee Chair 
Fenves spoke after Scott. He 
described his committee’s task as 
“providing a mechanism to main-
tain dialogue” between the mem­
bers of the University, and “later, 
to keep the University abreast of 
developments.” Also, Fenves 
noted that the student committee 
will independently produce its 
own “white paper,” addressing 
student concerns regarding the 
search. The student white paper 
will also be distributed.
The floor was given back to 
Fetkovitch, who opened the meet­
ing to questions and comments.
Fetkovitch was asked if other 
universities’ search procedures 
were used as models for the cur­
rent setup. He responded that the 
Senate had looked at the proce­
dures used by sixteen universi­
ties that had conducted similar 
searches within the past five 
years. He remarked that “every-
body does it differently,” and that 
a procedure similar to the one 
used at CMU back in 1972 was 
agreed upon by the Faculty Sen­
ate. Fetkovitch also remarked 
that the Senate decided against 
the use of “headhunters” — out­
side search firms — citing poor 
results at other universities who 
employed such firms.
The most heated issue of the 
meeting quickly became confiden­
tiality. In light of internal and 
external media coverage, the 
problem of how the search could 
be conducted in private was 
raised. Fetkovitch explained that 
the committees “want as much as 
possible to come out,” but that the 
members of every committee have 
sworn not to reveal anything 
about the candidates.
Fetkovitch noted explicitly that 
this oath extends to Tartan Edi- 
tor-in-Chief Karl Barnhart, a 
member of the student commit­
tee which has been disbanded.
Fetkovitch stressed confidenti­
ality as essential, particularly in 
cases where quality candidates 
submit themselves only on the 
condition that their candidacy
remain secret.
Fetkovitch concluded the meet­
ing by saying that CMU’s search 
procedure is “unique,” with a siz­
able faculty representation on the 
steeringcommittee, awillingness 
to cooperate on the part of the 
trustees, and plenty of time, 
thanks to the timing of Cyert’s 
announcement.

? emergency room situation if it ap­
pears while the Health Center is 
closed. For students who develop 
•’symptoms at these times, Barkin 
recommends the following treat­
ment: two tablets ofTylenol, Advil, 
I* or Nuprin every four hours, warm 
salt water gargles, throat loz­
enges, andlarge volumes of fluids.
Strep throat is spread through 
saliva and other bodily fluids. The 
disease has an incubation period 
9 of two to four days and patients 
are contagious from three days 
before symptoms appear until 72 
. hours after they begin taking anti­
biotics.
Barkin said that roommates and 
f others who are required to be 
around strep throat patient are 
in no great danger of catching the 
disease as long as the infected
persons take reasonable precau­
tions. Patients should be careful 
to cover their mouths when cough­
ing or sneezing.
Tissues should be disposed of 
properly and infected persons 
should wash their hands fre­
quently to avoid spreading germs 
to objects they touch. They should 
also avoid kissing and sharing 
glasses or eating utensils with 
uninfected people.
Barkin commented that the 
abnormally high temperatures 
over the last few weeks have 
probably contributed to the strep 
throat outbreak. She said that 
strep is most commonly found in 
moderately cold weather, typi­
cally during spring and fall.
Cold winter weather tends to 
decrease its spread and it is virtu­
ally never found in the summer.

'changes,” CFP President Phil 
Antonson said. “We thought we’d 
get input from the fraternity sys­
tem as a whole.” Greeks may plan 
to force the issue on the spring 
ballotby gathering250signatures 
ron a petition.
Part of the motivation for the 
! proposal-may come from the fact 
that activities fee money is used 
to sponsor four buggy organiza­
tions: Pioneers, Carnegie Involve­
ment Association (CIA), Fringe, 
and Spirit, the defending cham­
pion of the Sweepstakes title.
“Fraternities end up support­
ing buggy organizations that are 
their competitors,” said James 
Shaw, president of Sigma Nu. “I 
think the proposal’s a good idea.” 
According to public Student 
Senate records, $8647 is budg­
eted for the four buggy programs
this year — a figure which in­
cludes a new buggy for Pioneers. 
Senate fiscal policy mandates that 
an activities-fee sponsored buggy 
team can request a new buggy 
only once in three years, and must 
produce at least 10% of the cost 
from outside income.
At least two sororities — Delta 
Gamma and Kappa Alpha Theta 
— do not support the plan. “Al­
though we feel the activities fee is 
not appropriated fairly, we don’t 
feel that this is the right pro­
posal,” Theta President Lynanne 
Carr said. ‘We don’t feel that it’s 
fair to take the money away from 
other organizations.”
Indeed, the fact that the pro­
posal is completely anonymous 
may hurt its credibility. DG Presi­
dent Lisa Weaver “didn’t think 
anyone was taking it seriously” 
because it arrived in Greek mail-
“The curious thing about this petition 
is that it's an anonymous proposal, 
and that's why I haven’t taken it too 
seriously. ”
— DU President Rob Holton
boxes unsigned and unexplained.
Delta Upsilon President Rob 
Holton also questioned the au­
thor’s secrecy in a conversation 
before the Thursday CFP meet­
ing. “The curious thing about this 
petition is that it’s an anonymous 
proposal, and that’s why I haven’t 
taken it too seriously.”
Although most CFP members 
do not know who wrote the pro­
posal, a rumor circulating through 
the fraternities places the author
within Theta Xi. The Tartan was 
unable to confirm or disprove the 
rumor.
Although a reporter was allowed 
to see five minutes of the Thurs­
day CFP meeting, nothing of con­
sequence was discussed in the 
open segment of the meeting.
“I was a little upset with CFP’s 
decision to withhold information,” 
Kappa Sigma’s Bacus told The 
Tartan. “I just think they’re hurt­
ing themselves.”
Residential backlog 
delays cable installation
By RANDY L. UDAVCAK
Tartan Staffwriter
Sometime last semester, 
work ceased on the installa­
tion of cable television in the 
dorms, and since early last 
semester there has been no 
communication between Pitts­
burgh Telecommunications 
(TCI) and Carnegie Mellon.
According to a TCI represen­
tative, however, the company 
hopes to complete the CMU 
installation soon.
Last August, TCI began in­
stalling underground cable 
television lines on campus 
according to an agreement be­
tween TCI and the University. 
The arrangement called for the 
installation of cable hookups 
to each of the SDC public tele­
vision sets in the dorms, as 
well as the fraternities and so­
rorities.
According to Director of 
Housing Tony Martin, the 
company had already begun 
installing lines in the Hill area. 
“They even gave me a schedule 
when they were planning to 
finish up on the Hill,” said 
Martin, “and then move over to 
Mudge, Morewood, and the 
Fraternities — and then they 
disappeared. One day they 
were here, and the next day 
they were not here.”
Bob Stanish, TCI supervisor 
of commercial installations, 
said that work will resume 
February 6. “When they begin 
on Monday, the work will con­
tinue until it’s completed.” 
Stanish said the interruption 
in work on the project was due
to a backlog of residential work, 
as company policy dictates that 
residential installations are to 
be given priority over commer­
cial installations.
Martin said he had since 
tried to contact the company 
on many occasions but has thus 
far been unable to make any 
headway. “Never any phone 
calls returned — nothing. I 
hate to chalk it up to the diffi­
culty of dealing with a monop­
oly, but I’m afraid that’s the 
only thing I can conclude.” 
Currently, TCI is under exclu­
sive contract with the city of 
Pittsburgh to be the sole in­
staller of cable television lines.
As for the lack of contact be­
tween TCI and the University, 
Stanish said that the installa­
tion crew attempted to contact 
Martin to inform him that work 
on the project would be de­
layed, but were unable to do 
so. “They stopped in, and he 
was not available,” Stanish told 
The Tartan.
No tentative date of comple­
tion has been established due 
to problems which are cur­
rently hindering installation 
in the sororities, Morewood 
Gardens, and Mudge, accord­
ing to Stanish.
A Pittsburgh city ordinance 
states that cable lines must 
follow the route of the utilities. 
Both Morewood and Mudge 
have underground utility 
leads, as opposed to aerial 
leads, which creates additional 
problems. Additionally, said 
Stanish, installation under­
ground can be “as much as 
twenty times more expensive.”
You dorit need your patenté money to buy a Macintosh
Just their signature,
It’s never been difficult for students to con­
vince their parents of the need for a Macintosh® 
computer at school,
Persuading them to write the check, however, 
is another thing altogether.
Which is why Apple created the Student Loan- 
to-Own Program. An ingenious loan program 
that makes buying a Macintosh as easy as using 
one.
Simply pick up an application at the location 
. listed below, or call 8OO-83I-LOAN. All 
your parents need to do is fill it out,
sign it, and send it. If they qualify, they’ll receive 
a check for you in just a few weeks.
There’s no collateral. No need to prove finan­
cial hardship. No application fee.
Best of all, the loan payments can be spread 
over as many as 10 years.
Which gives you and your parents plenty of 
time to decide just who pays for it all.

Student Senate resolution of January 24
(Editor’s note: The following is 
the text of Student Senate’s reso­
lution criticizing President Ro- 
bitshek’spolicy regarding the for­
mation of a Student Committee 
for the presidential search.)
A RESOLUTION
Whereas, the choice of a new 
president is among the most 
important decisions made at this 
university;
Whereas, a student Presiden­
tial Search Committee should be 
made up of a diverse group of 
students;
Whereas, nominations for this 
Committee should be open to any
and all interested students;
Whereas, the current Commit­
tee has had only one meeting, 
while the Presidential search 
process will take well over a year;
We, the Student Senate of Car­
negie Mellon University, urge that 
the current Student Subcommit­
tee of the Faculty Presidential 
Search Committee be dissolved, 
and replaced with representatives 
who are openly nominated and 
fairly elected.
We further urge the President 
of Student Government to coop­
erate with the Senate by consent­
ing to the parameters outlined 
below. If this resolution passes
and the President of Student 
Government does not veto it, we 
shall assume he will cooperate 
fully.
The committee shall be chosen 
from nominees, who will be solic­
ited via as vigorous a publicity 
campaign as can be mounted in 
the next week. Nominees shall 
appear at the next Senate meet­
ing and be voted in by the Senate. 
Student positions on the Com­
mittee shall consist of one repre­
sentative from each of the follow­
ing:
College of Humanities and 
Social Sciences
Mellon College of Science 
College of Fine Arts 
Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy 
Spirit
Gay and Lesbian Alliance 
Asian Student Association 
Women for Women 
Greek System 
Student Dormitory Council 
This Committee shall elect a 
Chair from its own ranks. This 
Chair shall be the Student Repre­
sentative on the Presidential 
Search Steering Committee.
As per usual, the Chair of Sen­
ate shall oversee the election 
process.

(Editor’s note: The following is 
the text of Robitshek’s veto of the 
above resolution.)
TO: STUDENT SENATE
FROM: Andrew Robitshek, 
Student Government President
RE: Presidential Search Com­
mittee
I am hereby vetoing the resol­
ution entitled “A Resolution” that 
the Student Senate passed on 1/ 
24/89. There are two main points 
the Senate resolution asserts: one, 
that the process for selecting 
members of the committee was 
wrong and that Student Senate 
should set up this committee; two, 
that the committee Senate out­
lined in its proposal is a better 
representation of the campus.
To begin with, I was disap­
pointed by the fact that the Rules 
Committee did not invite me to 
their committee meeting when 
this was proposal was discussed. 
Differences in opinion and idea 
are much easier to resolve by 
interaction and compromise.
According to the Constitution of 
the Studeht Government of Car­
negie Mellon University, the first 
duty and power of the Student 
Government President is that of 
creating external committees. It 
can be argued as to whether or 
not this is an external committee; 
-however, I was asked to form this 
committee by the Chairman of 
Faculty Senate, and I had input 
from the Faculty Senate and Vice 
President Elliott in the creation 
process.
The committee I put together 
consists of eight members of the 
undergraduate student body. 
Eight of the larger organizations 
on campus were each asked to 
nominate one person to the com­
mittee. The nominees were asked 
to be non-seniors and hard work­
ing, dependable students who 
would not be too busy, and there­
fore would be able to give a good 
deal of their time.
The object of this committee is 
to represent all students and to 
give advice as to what the student 
body wants in a new president.
These students were asked to be 
at the search meetings, represent­
ing not only one group or organi­
zation but representing, rather, 
all students. By asking large 
organizations to nominate repre­
sentatives to this committee I had 
hoped to get a diverse group of 
students who are involved in the 
campus, and therefore know what 
is going on; they have contact 
with many different constituen­
cies, not just one special interest. 
Also, the president of an organi­
zation knows the people in his/ 
her organization better than any 
other person, and that is why they 
were asked choose a representa­
tive.
The problem with the Senate 
resolution is that it asks some of 
the special interest groups that, 
according to one senator, “have 
the most to lose” to be on this 
committee. This is too simplified 
a model; any group that is not 
represented has much to lose. 
Other special interest groups 
include:
Handicapped Students
Jewish Students 
Foreign Students 
Transfer Students 
Commuters
Athletes, and many others.
It is clear that any effort to 
include all special interests will 
make the committee too large and 
will negatively impact the com­
mittee’s effectiveness in meeting 
any student’s needs. What is most 
important is that the students on 
the committee represent substan­
tially large constituencies and will 
seek input from all students. I 
firmly believe that the current 
committee will do just that.
In fairness, I accept Senate’s 
concern over the representation 
of gays/lesbians and CFA. In fact, 
I had already stated that I would 
select a representative from CFA 
to serve on the committee. I will 
appoint one or two students from 
these groups in the same manner 
in which the other committee 
members were selected. I welcome 
the Senate’s input for these posi­
tions.
Write it.

Senate’s “busy” week
¦ During a three-hour “emer­
gency” meeting Sunday, Student 
Senate finally managed to cas­
trate the student government 
president.
Following a week of controversy, 
the meeting was meant to find a 
compromise between a Senate 
resolution and a presidential veto 
regarding the student committee 
formed to help select the 
University’s next president. 
However, largely due to an inef­
fective chair, the meeting only 
produced a tentative plan to re­
place the present committee.
Briefly, Senate disagreed with 
the way Student Government 
President Andrew Robitshek 
appointed the search committee.
We at The Tartan support Ro- 
bitshek’s original committee.
The undergraduate members of 
his committee were nominated by 
large on-campus organizations 
selected by Robitshek. These rep­
resentatives came from Spirit, AB, 
Student Dormitory Council, The 
Tartan, Council of Fraternity 
Presidents, Panhel, and Senate 
and included students from every 
college except MCS and CFA.
Calling this selection process an 
example of the “old boy network,” 
Senate argued that the commit­
tee is neither representative of 
the student body nor considerate 
of minority special interest groups.
So, under Senate’s “compro­
mise,” the search committee would 
include one representative each 
from Senate, Panhel, CFP, SDC, 
GALA, and Spirit. Also, one stu­
dent from each of the four under­
graduate colleges and a final rep­
resentative from the IM depart­
ment would sit on the committee.
Senate’s committee does not 
include AB, The Tartan, or cur­
rent chair Kishore Rao.
While we don’t support Senate’s 
decision to exclude us from the 
committee, we understand its 
position. Our presence raises some 
obvious questions regarding sen­
sitive information about individ­
ual candidates; on the other hand, 
our members are among the most 
informed students on campus.
Nonetheless, the central issue is 
the way Senate undermined 
Robitshek’s authority. According 
to the Student Government 
Constitution, Robitshek’s primary 
duty is to appoint external com­
mittees. And, despite the expla­
nation given by Chair Glenn
Kombrek at his emergency meet­
ing, this is an external committee.
While no one gives the president 
license to make irresponsible ap­
pointments, we have to remem­
ber that Robitshek was elected by 
the student body. His constitu­
ency includes all students and he 
is charged to act as the student 
body’s agent. We have to remem­
ber that we elected Robitshek 
president of student government.
Ironically, Senate — whose slo­
gan is “working together we get 
things done” — often forgets that 
Robitshek is on its side. Unbe­
lievably, Senate didn’t even talk 
to the president before calling its 
“emergency” meeting.
Much ofthe blame rests squarely 
on Kornbrek’s shoulders. After 
chairing threemeetings, Kombrek 
has proven to be ineffective, let­
ting others run his meetings and 
failing to control the discussions. 
For example, last week when 
Senate passed its resolution, some 
Senators complained that they 
didn’t know what they were vot­
ing for and others complained they 
were simply voting for the lesser 
of two evils. These complaints are 
inexcusable, especially since Sen­
ate has few experienced Senators.
Given many domineering indi­
viduals on Senate, the chairman 
needs a strong personality, some­
thing Kornbrek is obviously lack­
ing. He doesn’t cut people off when 
they are out of line. And usually 
more than one person is fighting 
to claim the floor.
Finally, we question the need to 
call an emergency meeting. More­
over, we question Kombrek’s abil­
ity to call an emergency mfeeting.
As for the first, a strong resolu­
tion, one that all Senators under­
stood and agreed upon, would have 
eliminated the need to have an 
emergency meeting. Again, 
largely because Kombrek let the 
meeting get out of hand, Senate 
passed a weak resolution on Tues­
day that should have been vetoed.
As for the second, according to 
the constitution, the only person 
with the power to call an emer­
gency meeting is Robitshek. 
Kombrek, though he isn’t explic­
itly denied this right, claims he-is 
implicitly granted this ability. 
Last we knew it took a 2/3 major­
ity to amend the constitution.
For an organization long-con- 
sidered unproductive, Senate has 
had a “busy” week.

Chairman explains referenda voting procedure
Editor:
As chairman of the Student Senate 
Elections Board, I wish to address one 
specific issue raised in the 1/24 article 
“Referendum creates more questions 
than it. answers;” namely, the alleged 
“balloting irregularity.”
Simply stated, there was no irregular­
ity. Electioneers were trained to take the 
student’s ID, check off their name, then 
either hand back the ID, ballot, and ref­
erendum all at once or hand back the bal­
lot and ID and ask the student to take a
.8uu8ri uo uM8 L3muor
referendum (which were beside the bal­
lots and controlled in the same manner
— one to a student).
Although I grant that a few exceptions 
might have taken place—someone might 
have taken two pages stuck together, 
etc. — of the eleven hours I personally 
tended the balloting, each person re­
ceived at most one referendum. Further­
more, I have heard no reports from th'£ 
Elections Board of any multiple contri­
butions of referenda.
To summarize, referendum distribu­
tion was fair. Each voter was given the 
option of filling out one and only one refT 
erendum, and to the best of my know?-» 
edge, no one turned in multiple refer­
enda. X

Editor:
I would like to begin this letter by 
extending my gratitude towards Peter 
Papagianakis for not following through 
with his initial reaction of finding me 
and smashing my face [“ATO defends 
Airband Behavior,” 1/9].
Secondly, I will respond to the ques­
tion that Mr. Papagianakis directed 
towards me and that is: why didn’t I 
simply approach the ATO brothers and
tell them to keep it down during Ron 
Darien’s performance? Mr. Papagianakis 
stated that he managed to collect him­
self after his initial reaction. How long 
did that take? The point I am trying to 
make is that at the time of Airband, I 
thought the ATO brothers would respond 
in a manner detrimental to my health. I 
did not have any assurances that the 
case would be different, so I expressed 
my distaste in a letter to the editor.
I would like to thank Mr. Papagianakis* 
for giving me his assurance that nothing 
would have happened. If I had knowp, 
this at the time of Airband and the broth; ¦ 
ers did cooperate, my first letter would 
never have made it to The Tartan. I 
extend my apologizes to the ATO broth­
ers that I offended.
Kevin Barney,
Sophomore, Math & Tech. Writing
Teaching awards are confusing
In the past, I have been criticized for 
focusing on the negative aspects of edu­
cation at Carnegie Mellon, and indeed, 
in keeping with the philosophy of sand­
ing down the rough spots, this column 
has dedicated itself to pointing out prob­
lems and solutions. This week, however, 
I would like to point out something posi­
tive: the recognition that Carnegie Mel­
lon awards to faculty and staff members.
This topic comes to mind because of 
discussion I had with some friends last 
fall. They were discussing what an excel­
lent teacher they thought their calculus 
professor, Dr. Jack Schaeffer, is. Having 
just seen an advertisement asking for 
proposals for the Ryan Teaching Award 
in The Tartan, I suggested that they 
submit his name to the selection commit­
tee. They responded that they did not 
know how to write the proposal, that 
they believed that the proposal had to 
include a great deal of information on the 
faculty member’s research, and that 
proposals submitted by students were 
not taken seriously.
The William H. and Frances S. Ryan 
Teaching Award is the highest profile 
award given at Carnegie Mellon. The 
Ryan award is given out once each year 
in the spring semester to “recogniz[e] 
unusual devotion and effectiveness in 
teaching undergraduate students.” Past 
winners of the award include statistics 
professor Joel Greenhouse, history pro­
fessor Ludwig Shaefer, and chemical 
engineering professor Edmond Ko. In 
addition to an honorarium, this year’s 
Ryan award winner will be given a re­
ception and be the featured speaker at 
the senior honors banquet.
In the fall semester, the administra­
tion sent out a request for students to 
submit proposals for nomination. Any 
group of five students could nominate a 
teacher in a two page proposal. However, 
according to Traci Radzyniak and Pro­
vost Angel Jordan, there were only three 
proposals submitted by groups of stu­
dents, one of which was submitted by 
Lambda Sigma, an organized entity. This 
could perhaps be attributed to the much 
belabored CMU apathy, but perhaps
E; KoIri8 
©mVM82U kbKb kroeu
there are other reasons.
After reading the memo about the Ryan 
award and the advertisement in The 
Tartan and speaking with Radzyniak 
and Jordan for an hour, I am still not 
exactly sure how such a proposal should 
be written. There are several example 
questions given on the memo, but noth­
ing substantial. As evidenced by my 
friends, students really had no idea what 
should be done.
When informed of my friends’ (and my 
own) ignorance of the procedures, Jor­
dan stated that much of what we be­
lieved was incorrect. First and foremost, 
student proposals are taken very seri­
ously, perhaps more seriously than pro­
posals by faculty. He also stated that in 
the future, Ted Fenton of the teaching 
center would help any interested stu­
dents prepare their proposals. Finally, 
he emphatically declared that there was 
absolutely no value placed on research in 
determining the Ryan award.
Armed with this information, I de­
cided to investigate the other awards 
given to faculty and staff at CMU.
After the Ryan award, perhaps the 
most prestigious award is the Robert 
Doherty prize, which is open to faculty 
and staff members. The Doherty prize 
recognizes excellence in education at all 
levels: curriculum development, creation 
of course material, implementation of 
new teaching methods, and much more.
Each college within the CMU hegem­
ony also recognizes their outstanding 
faculty: H&SS has the Elliot Dunlop 
Smith award (last awarded to Dr. Sch- 
oenwald ofthe history department), CIT 
has the Ladd award, MCS has the Julius 
Ashkin award (last awarded to physics 
professor Helmut Vogel), and CFA has 
the ' Henry Hornbostel award (last 
awarded to Marilyn Thomas of the music 
department). In addition, each depart­
ment within each college recognizes its
outstanding faculty.
The profusion of awards and the rela­
tive difficulty (several hours of téléphoné1 
calls for the minimal information pre* 
sented above) of finding out what the, 
awards are and who has won them leads 
me to propose that all the departmental!; 
college, and university-wide awards be; 
compiled in a central directory and then: 
distributed. While winning any award is; 
nice, I believe that the effect would be; 
greatly enhanced if more people knew of. 
the outstanding efforts of many of CMlFs 
faculty. While budgets are tight and timéi 
is scarce, this project could be acconw; 
plished for nothing more than printing; 
costs. There are plenty of English majors; 
who would like nothing better than to;-- 
produce such a document to have for, 
their portfolios.
Next, I propose that the names of thèi 
various award winners be marked in the^ 
schedule of classes. For example, if there' 
are five available physics recitations, 
and one is taught by Dr. Vogel, there 
should be an indication of this in the; 
course offering catalogue. This would 
enable students to more easiy decide for. 
which courses they would want to regisi 
ter. i
Finally, in reference to the Ryan award; 
I propose that the selection committeej 
accept applications the year round, sim­
ply using the October 24 deadline to. 
separate a year’s worth of proposals. 
This would allow students to take mote 
time to prepare their applications, thus 
improving the quality of the applications 
and the overall number submitted.
So, even in applauding the work done 
by members of the administration in the 
matter of awards and recognition, I woulji 
like to prod them to greater heights. The 
few improvements suggested abovf 
would not strain budgets or upset tin® 
constraints, but would make the award- 
even more valuable than they are now
Michael D.C. Drout, a junior profeS‘ 
sional writing major, would like to than

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon • 31 January 19899
President Cyert addresses the question of research
! I want to welcome all of you 
back to the campus, and I hope 
{hat you have a productive sec­
ond semester. Because it 
has been a couple of months 
Since I have written to you,
{ thought it was time that 
jrou hear from me again.
Since several students have 
asked me, I am devoting 
this article to research at 
Carnegie Mellon.
; On September 14,1988,1 
published “Organization 
Announcement No. 317,” which 
States the research policy of Car­
negie Mellon University. The
search is inappropriate at Carne­
gie Mellon University except in 
the semi-autonomous units (Mel-
"This policy ... estab­
lishes the principle that 
classified research is in­
appropriate at Carnegie 
Mellon University...”
Ion Institute and the Software 
Engineering Institute).
I would like to point out that 
policy, which was the subject of there is no classified research
considerable debate in the cam­
pus community for over two years, 
was drafted by the University 
Research Council, was passed 
unanimously by the Faculty Sen- 
I &te, and was approved by the 
Board of Trustees of Carnegie 
Mellon.
! This policy seeks to resolve the 
tension between the desire to 
participate in classified research 
) and the desire to maintain the 
open atmosphere of the univer­
sity by confining classified re­
search to the semi-autonomous 
units, which are not associated 
with any academic departments. 
I This policy thereby established 
the principle that classified re-
anywhere in the academic units 
at Carnegie Mellon University. 
We have refused to take classi­
fied research in the academic 
sector since the early 1950s. This 
policy was President John 
Warner’s. Succeeding presidents 
have honored it, and I, too, be­
lieve in it strongly.
I also want to emphasize that 
no classified research is being 
carried out in the Software Engi­
neering Institute (SEI) or in 
Mellon Institute and there never 
has been. Dr. Larry Druffel, who 
manages the SEI under the direc­
tion of Provost Angel Jordan, 
operates the institute as a part of 
the University and is as open as
possible about the research there 
and about the use of the building 
subject to some restriction owing
------ to the fact that the SEI is a
federally funded research 
and development center.
The SEI is an important 
part of our goal of computer 
science activities on the 
campus. At the moment, 
the School of Computer Sci­
ence and the SEI are devel-
___ oping a master’s degree in
software engineering to be 
offered on this campus and to be 
conferred by the School of Com­
puter Science. In addition, we are 
making video cassettes and are 
sending them to a number of other 
universities and colleges that do 
not have the capacity to teach 
this subject. Thus, it will be pos­
sible for software engineering stu­
dents to take their first year at 
another institution and then 
transfer to our School of Com­
puter Science. The SEI is not to 
grant degrees.
One of the SEI’s objectives is to 
add to the programming capacity 
of the United States. The SEI is 
doing so by finding ways of in­
creasing productivity of program­
mers through a greater use of the 
computer in the programming 
process and through the develop­
ment of this master’s program,
among other projects. Since there 
has been an attempt to cast the 
research of the SEI in a bad light,
I have asked Dr. Druffel to pre­
pare and distribute an annual 
report within the Carnegie Mel­
lon community. I am pleased 
with the way the SEI is operat­
ing, and I regard it as an impor­
tant asset to the Pittsburgh com­
munity and to the country. Pro­
vost Jordan will soon make avail­
able to the campus through The 
Tartan and Focus a list of the re­
search projects conducted in the 
University, including those 
funded by the Department of
Defense. ----------------------------
Part of the 
concern 
about the 
SEI relates to 
the fact that 
the DoD pro­
vides a high 
percentage of our total research 
budget. It is true that, of the $ 111 
million of research done last year, 
approximately 43 percent of the 
research funds came from the 
DoD. This figure is not unusual 
for any of the major universities 
deeply involved in research on 
computers. The DoD has been 
the major source of such research 
funds and has done a good job of 
funding non-classified research.
This arrangement has enabled 
universities like Carnegie Mellon 
to use the money to further the in­
tellectual basis of computer sci­
ence.
In our country, the DoD has a 
large research budget. I have 
argued in a number of places that 
I would like to see more of this 
research money in the hands of 
the National Science Foundation. 
I believe that the spin-offs for the 
civilian economy for military re­
search are not as great as have 
been alleged and that, in addi­
tion, there are always spin-offs 
for the military from civilian-ori-
“In our case, we have to be careful 
about the large amount of research 
funding we get from the DoD.”
ented research. Over and above 
that argument however, the 
United States must have basic 
research heavily supported in the 
federal budget, because universi­
ties now conduct the vast amount 
of basic research in this country.
Whenever a university is de­
pendent on a particular organiza­
tion for support, the organization’s 
management must be alert to see 
that there is no undue influence
as a result of this dependence. 
This attitude is true for large, 
individual sponsors, for industrial 
corporations that may have,,% 
strong relationship with a uni­
versity, or for government units. 
In our case, we have to be careful 
about the large amount of re­
search funding we get from the 
DoD. Fortunately, the DoD is not 
some simple, single entity. There 
are many parts of the DoD, and 
our research funding comes from 
many of those parts. Thus, even 
though the dollars are aggregated 
under the title of DoD, it is as 
though we had eight or ten differ­
ent sponsors.
Because of the 
importance of aca­
demic freedom on,a 
university campus, I 
convened in 1985*an
— Academic Freedom 
Committee. d,vs 
committee’s function is to make 
certain that there are no viola­
tions of academic freedom on the 
campus. In addition, I have asked 
the committee to review the sub­
tler aspects of campus life to as­
sure that we maintain the aca­
demic ambience of a great univer­
sity. In a university as signifi­
cant as Carnegie Mellon, such a 
committee performs a great serv-

If you have read the front page, 
you’ve probably read about how 
i^ndy Robitshek vetoed Student 
Senate’s suggestion for a new 
student committee to find the new 
president for Carnegie Mellon. 
There will probably be a lot of flak 
at tonight’s meeting; it could be 
the best show of the semester if 
you’re interested in going.
I spent the last few semesters 
going to Senate and the question 
has always been, “What is Senate 
supposed to do?”
In their constitution, Senate is 
given more than a few duties. 
They include: get, allocate, and 
spend monies of the student gov­
ernment (i.e. the activities fee); 
approve student fund raising 
drives and charitable activities; 
give or take recognition of stu­
dent organizations; break a tie in 
a student election; make their 
minutes available for public rec­
ord; and enact “legislation.”
The president also has a list of 
duties: create external commit­
tees; be an ex-officio member of 
the Senates (student and faculty); 
enforce the laws, regulations, and 
decisions of Senate; not make or 
amend any motions; not vote, but 
is allowed to veto any “legisla­
tion.” The president of student 
government is elected by the stu­
dents, not by Senate.
The student president is respon­
sible for interaction between stu­
dents, faculty, staff, and admini­
stration. Because of this required 
¡rôle, the president is given the 
¡ability to create external commit­
tees of Senate, much like the 
cabinet positions in the federal 
jgovernment.
This should be the crux of any 
|ai'gument regarding the student 
presidential search committee.
The committee was created by 
the president as he is duly au­
thorized by the Senate 
Constitution. He is not required 
to ask Senate to approve his ap­
pointments. No where is he re­
quired to even tell Senate that he 
is creating and appointing mem­
bers to an external committee.
Humorous is the fact that ex­
ternal committees are never again 
mentioned in the Senate 
Constitution until the question of 
how to remove them is brought 
up. To remove a member, the 
president must get Senate ap­
proval to take him/her off the 
committee. The second method is 
for 50 members of Student Gov­
ernment to submit a petition 
“documenting alleged illegal or 
immoral activities on the part of 
an appointed officer or external 
committee” and then a vote of 
confidence in Senate is taken. The 
last method is that the member 
garners two consecutive absences 
from the body which they repre­
sent.
The new committee proposed 
by Senate is supposed to repre­
sent the campus more fairly than 
the present one. But is it Senate’s . 
job to create this new committee? 
According to their constitution, 
the answer is no. This constitution 
only says that Senate may re­
move members from an external 
committee in three ways, and it 
has not used any of these. If Sen­
ate wants to change this they must 
propose a constitutional amend­
ment, and not a resolution.
Under the words “legislation,” 
“resolution,” “whereas,” and “the 
non-involved student” it seems 
that Senate is overstepping its 
bounds and so the president is 
exercising his veto power. Could 
you really blame him?

Lions and tigers and interviews — Oh My! One man’s story
It takes a lot to get me scared. 
I’ve had meetings with Brad 
Walter, taken tests where the 
class average was 4%, and ar­
gued in Student Senate. How­
ever, Thursday I was scared; I 
had my first summer job inter­
view.
The thoughts that ran 
through my mind before the 
interview are the normal, nerv­
ous type; “Does my hair look 
ok?”; “Did I do enough research 
about the company?”; “Am I 
wearing clean underwear?”
Regardless, there I was in my 
newly-pressed suit, sweating 
like a pig. The anticipation 
mounted, and then the previ­
ous candidate left the room with 
the biggest grin I’d ever seen. 
He knew he had the job, the 
bastard.
My turn.
The recruiter greeted me. “Hi, 
so you’d like to work for Acme 
Widgets.”

pu8P .8Fml8
Pay me, and I’ll clean your 
plant’s septic system with my 
toothbrush. “Yes, it seems to be a 
good place to work.”
“We’d like think so, how did you 
get interested in us?”
Interested ... you think I’m in­
terested? Ha! I need a job, I don’t 
want one. “I’ve read a lot about 
you in Business Week, it seems 
like an exciting place to work.”
“I see by your resumé that you’re 
involved in a lot of things on 
campus.”
Yeah, dippy extra-curricular ex­
ercises don’t end after high school. 
“I try to keep myself busy, there 
are so many things do.”
“So what sort of experience do 
you have?”
I have kissed more tush than
you can imagine, I can handle 
anything. “Well, I worked last 
summer at Burger Barn.”
“Oh ... What sort of things do 
you do in your classes?”
You mean besides sleep1? “Oh, 
we’re still doing our core courses: 
marketing, finance, economics, 
accounting. Next year I get to 
specialize.”
“Well, it’s a strong program. 
Have you thought about what 
you want to do after school?” 
Yeah, ski naked at Vail, and 
become a taster for The Pittsburgh 
Brewing Company. “No, not yet.” 
“If you were to describe your­
self how would you?”
Stud of the ’80s and ’90s. “I 
don’t know. A hard worker, com­
petent, dependable.”
“What’s your biggest weak­
ness?”
You think I’m really going to 
tell you? “I work too hard trying 
to save lost causes.”
“So, is there anything you’d like
to know about Acme?”
Yeah, is everyone who works 
there as wimpy as you? “What 
types of jobs have interns in the- 
past done?”
“It depends on their qualifi­
cations. We try to tailor each 
job to the individual intern.”
Oh boy, they have a cafeteria 
there too. “Oh...”
“Well, we’re out of time Mr. 
Levine. You have very impres­
sive credentials and I’m sure 
we have a place for you. You’ll 
hear from us soon.”
Yeah right.
So ended my first interview. I 
guess it looks like it’s back to_ 
Burger Barn next summer, glad 
I asked them to save my apronr

The thing that has been bother­
ing me most about the argument 
over which students should be on 
the Presidential Search Commit­
tee is that so many people think it 
makes such a big difference.
There sOems to be a feeling 
around campus that any special 
interest group which is not di­
rectly represented on the com­
mittee will be left out of the deci­
sion process, and Carnegie Mel­
lon will end up with a president 
who is directly antagonistic to­
wards it. This is ridiculous. The 
next pre'sident of CMU is not going
to destroy _____________________

sor The

in any way 
to harm 
students.
The reason students have been 
asked to serve on the search 
committee is largely symbolic. The 
administration wants to show 
that they are taking student con­
cerns into account during the 
selection process. I am glad that 
they are doing so because stu­
dents are a significant segment of 
this university and should be 
considered in such an important 
decision. However, this goal does 
not require that every student 
issue have its own personal rep­
resentative.
The members of the student 
committee should be a diverse 
group who are in contact with the 
student body in general. In my 
opinion the current committee 
meets these criteria very well. 
The eight undergraduate mem-
YolIuMIl .8Ft
bers include one' or more men, 
women, whites, blacks, Jews, 
Asian-Americans, and undoubt­
edly many other groups of which
I am not aware.
In addition, all eight members 
have shown themselves to be lead­
ers in various ways and have ties 
to many other students.
The only glaring omission is the 
lack of a CFA student. However

The faculty search committee 
has already shown an interest in 
obtaining input from all aspects 
of the University community by 
holding an open meeting to solicit 
suggestions. Hopefully, the stu­

want to emphasize particular 
qualities they wish to see in the 
next president will be able to do 
so. Even if such a meeting is not 
held, I would expect members of 
the committee to be open to per­

Hockey club looking for playoff spot
By DAVID WILLIS
Tartan Staffwriter
With a week of no losses, the 
Carnegie Mellon hockey club 
continues to climb the ranks of 
top teams in the Western Penn­
sylvania Club Hockey Associa­
tion (WPCHA). The Tartans 
posted a 1-0-2 mark this week, 
defeating Penn State and tying 
Slippery Rock and Indiana Uni­
versity of PA (IUP). This puts 
the team, which is eagerly 
awaiting a rematch with front 
running Pitt, in second place.
Sophmore co-captain Denny
Frey expressed some reservations 
about the team’s play, cautioning 
that they have “been letting down 
in the third period.” He men­
tioned, in particular, the January 
22 game against Penn State at 
Kittaning, in which CMU had to 
withstand a late rally to preserve 
its 4-3 lead.
In last Saturday’s game against 
Slippery Rock, it was the Tartans 
who were forced to come from 
behind. A late goal by sophmore 
center Craig Palli enabled them 
to escape with a 4-4 tie.
CMU played to a 5-5 tie against 
the Indians of IUP last Sunday in
Kittaning. Neil Smith led the 
Tartan attack with two goals and 
one assist. Both of Smith’s goals 
came in the first period, the first 
putting the Tartans ahead 2-1, 
and the second to tie the game, 3- 
3.
CMU’s Ed Kilduff gave the 
Tartans a 4-3 lead on a penalty 
shot created by Todd Henderson. 
On the previous play, IUP goalie 
Matt Stasko threw his stick at 
Henderson as he was skating to 
the goal. The second period ended 
in a 4-4 tie. Each team scored 
once more in the third period.
With a 4-1-2 record, the Tar­
tans appear capable of chal­
lenging Pitt for the top spot in 
the WPCHA. Despite losing the 
first contest of the season be­
tween the two teams, the CMU 
club remains optimistic. Frey 
is confident the Tartans have 
the talent to win, noting that 
his team “didn’t have the depth 
[the first time CMU and Pitt 
played] that it does now.” 
With four games remaining 
in the regular season, the Tar­
tans would appear a safe bet to 
make the playoffs, and their 
added depth may bring them 
the championship.

The Big, The Bad, The Bub
Grandmothers, as most of us 
know, can be one of life’s great 
blessings, or one of fate’s crud­
est jokes. For some of us, our 
grannies or grandmas can be a 
unique conglomeration of both.
However, my Bubby (a Yid­
dish nickname) is truly one of a 
kind. She is not the doddering, 
old fool one often jokes about. 
And she is not the wise old owl 
of the family one associates with 
Grandpa Walton. Plain and 
simple; she is a nut. .
This is a woman who lives to 
see her grandson’s name on the 
credits of some successful TV 
show. When it was still on the 
,ajr, she would call me after 
3*j£ry episode of Hill Street 
'üJiTies and ask why my name 
„was not on the list. The ironic 
thing is, she was not kidding.
, My little nieces gave her their 
own nickname: The Big, The 
Bad, The Bub.
Bubby loves to have me come 
over for dinner during the week. 
She cooks for me — steaks, 
roasts, turkey — anything I 
want. We watch TV and talk.
Like most old pepple, she is 
both mentally and physically 
slow. She is hard óf hearing, 
and often forgets my name. But 
there is one thing in which the
% Bub is no slouch — sports.
: . Bubby, like almost every 
nátive Pittsburgher, is an 
expert when it comes to the 
£>teelers. She is one of the few 
authorities left on the great 
dynasty of the 1970s and is one 
of the teams biggest fans and 
áTTarpest critics.;
It always stuns me. When 
ever I feel our conversation slip­
ping, one of us will bring up 
football, and it’s as if someone 
just recharged her battery.
She’s also versatile. When­
ever, if ever, we exhaust the 
subject of football, we jabber on 
about professional wrestling. 
Pittsburgh is the birthplace of 
one of the sport’s first and 
greatest stars, Bruno 
Samartino. The city’s tradition 
in this American institution 
carries on in the spirit of people 
like my Bubby.
Her favorites are Hulk Hogan 
and George “The; Animal”
Steele. Her eyes get wide and I 
feel I might have-to fetch her 
pills whenever I ftiention my 
favorite Jake “The Snake.”
She is also not too bad when it 
comes to the news. She is pretty 
up-to-date when it comes to 
current affairs. Naturally, I 
attribute this to the fact that 
one usually has to watch at 
¡ least 15 to 20 minutes of news 
; on a nightly local broadcast,
; before the sportscast comes on.
¡ I mention all of this because 
! my bubby recently had a stroke, 
but is recuperating nicely.
When I visited her for the first 
time, I found her old cues were 
still working.
The first thing she asked me 
was who I picked in the Super 
Bowl (which was in three days).
I told her Cincinnati and she got 
out of her wheelchair and railed 
me for 10 minutes about how 
much of an idiot I was for this. 
My cousin later told me that 
; that was one of the few times 
she hadn’t needed help to get 
out of her wheelchair.
People often accuse old people 
of faking senility for attention. 
My Bubby’s stroke was real, but 
she can still rattle off most of 
Terry Bradshaw’s lifetime stats. 
I’m sure she’ll be cooking 
brisket and chicken soup for me, 
real soon.

The University Rowing Club of * 
Carnegie Mellon has been taking 
giant steps, or giant strokes, in 
the year since it became an offi­
cial club on campus. Its latest . 
achievement is the construction „ 
of a boathouse for*the club.
Hard work is the probably tljie \ 
best explanation for the new ( 
boathouse that is being erected £ 
for use by the URC on Herrs Is- | 
land, located on the Allegheny , 
River. Designed by the architec- [ 
tural firm Design Alliance, tne 
boathouse is intended to be used , 
as an exercise and social center • 
for the rowing clubs of CMIi, , 
Duquesne University, Pitt, an[d 
the local Three Rivers Rowing - t 
Association (TRRA). The ground ( 
floor contains four bays that are 
large enough to store ten eight 
seater boats. The upper level pf 
the boathouse contains locker | 
rooms, offices for the coaches, a|n -.11 
exercise center, and a social are&. ,
TRRA has acted as the umbrelia , 
company to raise the $750,000 
needed to construct on the boat­
house. The money came from lo­
cal foundations and universities, j 
including Carnegie Mellon, who j 
was actually the first of the uni­
versities involved to contribute 
It also dealt with the practical | 
problems surrounding the eri- j 
deavor, which included obtaining 
the land and permission tobuiljd . 
from the City of Pittsburgh.
Harry Printz, President of the 
URC, sees the new boathouse s(s 
“galactic exitement.” He explained 
his enthusiasm, commenting th^t 4< 
it is “fantastic that people were , 
able to put in the energy.” Print# 
and the TRRA are hopeful that 
the boathouse will renew enthu­
siasm in rowing. At one poinji, 
there were over twenty boa^-1A 
houses along the Allegheny anji 
the Monongahela rivers, and theji 
rowing went into a decline. Printz 
believes that the new boathouse 
“will have a positive effect on the 
sport.” ; jjs
The boathouse, whose official 
groundbreaking was January 13, 
is expected to be finished in mid 
to late May.
Thiel’s Julie Sierota and Lisa 
Popovich kept the Tartans close. 
The first half ended with a 25- 
foot shot by Lady Tomcat Rachel 
Farah, which made the score 36- 
32 in favor of Thiel.
The Lady Tartans pulled them­
selves together in the second half, 
outscoringThiel, 44-37. Smith sat 
out the last part of the second 
half after an getting an elbow in 
her already bruised ribs.
“I was really sore, but I actu­
ally did OK for being hurt,” said 
Smith.
Co-captain Lisa Lightner led 
the CMU scoring with 21 points, 
followed by Smith and Tricia 
Chorgo with 16 and 14 points, 
respectively. Chorgo and co-cap- 
tain Beth Virgin combined for 27 
rebounds.
“[The victory against] Thiel was 
especially sweet. We’ve been 0-6 
against them since I’ve been 
here,” Lightner commented.
Last Tuesday, the Lady Tar­
tans jumped out to a quick 5-0 
lead over the Lady Presidents, 
and five minutes into the game 
had opened up an 11-4 advan­
tage. Half way through the first 
half, it became a 22-6 lead, and 
after a W & J timeout, the Lady 
Presidents came back on the court 
with six players to try and even 
up the matchup.
At the half, CMU had a 34-17

tie for second place
URC gets 
boathouse

GREENVILLE — It’s amaz­
ing what a difference a week 
makes. After losing three 
straight the week before, the 
Tartans (5-11,3-2 PAC) turned 
around and knocked off two 
Presidents’Athletic Conference 
rivals, Washington and Jeffer­
son (6-8, 2-3) and Thiel (1-14, 
0-5). The wins put Carnegie 
Mellon in a three-way tie for 
second place with Hiram and 
John Carroll, one game behind 
conference leader Grove City.
“It’s probably taken us some 
games and some lumps,” ex­
plained Head Coach Larry An­
derson. The change of fortunes 
has come as a welcome change 
to the team which has had its 
share of hard luck and break 
downs already this season. 
However, he cautioned, “We’ve 
still got a long way to go, but 
there may be some new found 
kind of feeling.”
That feeling might be the per­
spective of looking down from 
high, early leads. And second- 
half collapses, an all too com­
mon occurrence this season, 
were nowhere to be seen last 
week. After the win over W&J,
co-captain Darryl Long re­
marked, “Normally one or two 
come to play, tonight everyone 
was playing hard.”
Against the Tomcats, it looked 
like Carnegie Mellon was going 
to come away with a rare, easy 
road victory. Behind strong first- 
half shooting by Long and fellow 
co-captain Daren Moffatt, CMU 
jumped out to a 21-8 lead.
Thiel, however, was not ready 
for an early shower. The Tomcat 
defense stiffened as Thiel 
outscored the Tartans 17-5 to 
close within one late in the first 
half. A Chris Luckett jump shot 
and a Rob Sechan three-pointer 
padded the lead, putting the 
Tartans on top at the half, 31-28.
The second-half became the 
Daren Moffatt show. The senior 
forward accounted for six of Car­
negie Mellon’s first eight points, 
on his way to 18 second-half 
points. Thiel came as close as 
four points after junior Jesse Bone 
thrilled the crowd with two con­
secutive jams, but that was the 
Tomcats’ last gasp. Carnegie 
Mellon went on to win, 66-55.
Moffatt led all scorers with 25 
points as well as nine rebounds. 
Long added 22 points and 12 
boards; Bone led Thiel with 18 
points.
Earlier in the week, the Tar­
tans faced off against the Presi­
dents of Washington and Jef­
ferson College. After a flat show­
ing against Chicago, CMU came 
out on fire.
The Tartans jumped out to a 
9-0 lead before junior Danny 
Jones put W&J on the score­
board. The Carnegie Mellon 
scoring machine continued 
unimpeded. A Sechan bomb 
gave the Tartans their biggest 
lead of the season, 27-8 with 
6:24 to go in the half.
The second half became 
merely an exercise in contain­
ment. The Presidents broke 
within ten points for only 24 
seconds, after Jones hit two 
three-pointers late in the half.
A six point mini-run quelled any 
threat of W&J making a game 
of it, and CMU coasted to a 71- 
58 win.
This Week: Tomorrow night,
Carnegie Mellon faces off 
against the Bethany Bisons (5- 
11, 2-2). The two teams split 
last season,each time the home 
team winning the game.

gie Mellon faces off against Photo by Tom Nichols

When teams learn how to win, 
the concept of losing consecu­
tive games can seem very for­
eign. Such is the case with the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s bas­
ketball team.
After losing to Chicago by one 
point, the Lady Tartans came 
back with two wins last week, 
defeating the Lady Tomcats of 
Thiel, 76-73, and the First La-
dies of Washington and Jefferson 
College, 63-47. This puts CMU on 
top of the Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC) at 6-0 and 13-4 
overall.
Saturday afternoon, the Lady 
Tartans travelled to Thiel Col­
lege, where the Lady Tomcats, 
three time defending PAC cham­
pions, were more than ready to 
play. Junior Lisa Smith got off to 
a good start, scoring all of her 16 
points in the first half. However, 
the 17 points accumulated by

A rare breed.
Are amateur athletes an endangered species?
RICHARD SHIPLEY
Special to the Tartan
am’a-teur n. 1. one who
pursues an activity for pleasure 
nstead of for material gain. - 
adj. not professional.
From Webster’s Handy College 
Dictionary 
In 1896, French aristocrat 
Baron Pierre de Coubertin helped 
start a tradition that would be­
come the ultimate goal for the 
modern amateur athlete — the 
first modem Olympic Games. The 
games were set up to help inter­
national relations, and to give the 
athletes of the world a chance to 
prove their abilities. The Baron 
believed that money corrupted the 
spirit and the good will created by 
athletics.
In most countries, very few 
athletes were able to compete 
because the time that 
was needed to train was 
immense, and they had 
time left to earn a 
living.
Eventually world- 
class stars began to ac­
cept money under-the- 
table from promoters,
and Eastern Bloc na- ______
tions began seeking out 
and supporting the best 
athletes that their nation had to 
offer. Nowadays, superstar ath­
letes like Carl Lewis and Ben 
Johnson are making millions off 
of promoters that they are “work­
ing for.”
Many countries outside of the 
USA support their athletes—ath­
letes who are not amateurs be­
cause they are making a living at 
their sport. Because of all this, 
professional athletes are now al­
lowed, according to the new In­
ternational Olympic Committee 
rules, to compete, if the national 
governing body of that sport 
approves of it. There are now 
tennis and hockey players, who 
earn millions of dollars each year, 
¿competing in games that were set 
up for gentlemen and amateurs.
If we can no longer turn to the 
Olympics for true amateur com­
petition, where can we turn? How 
about college athletics? The Na­
tional Collegiate Athletic Asso­
ciation, traditional home of spirit 
'and competition amongst ama­
in Dallas has been host to many of 
the recent controversies concern­
ing treatment and recruiting of 
athletes in the NCAA. SMU’sfoot- 
ball program was placed on pro­
bation for three years in August, 
1985, following a 29-month in­
vestigation by the NCAA. They 
were found in violation of NCAA 
rules for eleven out offifteen years. 
Charges included a payment of 
$25,000 to David Stanley, a for­
mer SMU linebacker, for coming 
to SMU, and $750 a month there­
after to him and his mother. This 
is not amateurism; this is quasi­
professionalism.
dragging them away from their 
studies. A coach’s life in Division 
III is certainly not easy or profit­
able.
What coach would want to 
compete at this level? Coaches 
trying to establish themselves 
until they can move on to bigger 
and better things? Not in the case 
of Gary Meckley, head cross-coun- 
try/track-and-field coach at Car­
negie Mellon University. He has 
established himself as one of the 
winningest coaches in NCAA 
history (he holds the record of 99

the current NCAA basketball 
champions, the Kansas Jay- 
hawks. The probation is due to a 
list of recruiting violations, such 
as the purchase of airline tickets 
for a recruit. Other teams like the
ues to stay at Carnegie Mellon. “I 
love what I’m doing,” says Meck­
ley.
Meckley shows that the true 
spirit behind sports is being the 
best that you can be. “If you do the

University of Kentucky, the 
sport’s winningest team, await 
the verdict of the NCAA on 
charges against them. The 
charges against Kentucky con­
tain a package including $1000 
that was sent to a recruit’s father.
Where can one turn to if the 
Olympics and colleges are not the 
answer? Actually, colleges are still 
the answer, but you have to look 
to the hidden Division III teams. 
Division III teams are not allowed 
to give any form of scholarships to 
their athletes other than for aca­
demic or financial reasons. Divi­
sion III schools are generally 
smaller, and push for higher 
academic records, instead of 
higher win/loss records.
Division III athletes are the 
truest form of the post-high school 
amateur athlete. They choose to 
compete because they love the 
sport and the competition. They 
do it for self-satisfaction and rec­
ognition from their peers. Seldom 
will a Division III athlete make it 
teurs in America, is the home of to the professional level of any
just as many, if not more, contro­
versies than the Olympics. Ath­
letes who barely made it through 
high school are getting a free ride 
through college; meanwhile, stu­
dents who are doing well in col­
lege can’t finish because they are

sport.
With no scholarships to give 
out, recruiting at Division III 
schools can be very difficult. 
Coaches and athletic directors 
need to depend a great deal on the 
reputation and affordability of 
their school to bring in the ath­
letes. After the athletes are at the 
school, an even harder task is
best you can, you’re not a loser,” 
Meckley tells his athletes. Meck­
ley is certainly not a loser.
He somehow manages to have 
winning teams (he has 29 cham­
pionships) in spite of the odds 
against him. The average cost for 
a freshman entering Carnegie 
Mellon in 1988 was $17, 500, not 
to mention the very competitive 
academic admission standards, 
but he captured yet another Presi­
dents Athletic Conference (PAC) 
championship in cross-country. 
He is now set on repeating the 
PAC track-and-field title.
You might wonder what’s wrong 
with giving athletes scholarships, 
or cash payments for the job that 
they do. What’s wrong is that the 
pressure to perform the best is 
intense, and the concern for one’s 
own well-being is shoved aside for 
the sake of keeping a scholarship. 
The result: students feel the obli­
gation to put a greater effort into 
sports instead of schoolwork, or 
people like 1986 Heisman Trophy 
candidate Brian Bosworth who 
put their own health aside and 
try to better themselves with dan­
gerous drugs.
There’s no room for this kind of 
pressure at schools like Carnegie 
Mellon, which is rated as one of 
the schools with the most stress 
among its students. The stress is 
from academics, certainly not 
sports. Many of the teams lose
players after their freshman or 
sophomore years, because they 
find it more important to spend 
time at their studies than sports; 
however, that is how it should be. 
Universities were set up to be 
educational institutions, not 
places to play sports for four years 
after high school.
Meckley admits that he has 
thought that giving scholarships 
would be nice, but he feels that 
Division III is true amateurism. 
“If you have the scholarship 
money to give out, anybody could 
be a good coach. At Division III, 
anybody can’t be a good coach.” 
His worries aren’t about the kids 
that he doesn’t have running for 
him; instead he concentrates on 
the people he does have, and does 
the best job he can with them. “If
I do that, and I lose; when I look at 
myself in the mirror, I’m still going 
to respect myself.”
---------- Perhaps, it’s too much
or too late to ask to have 
things changed in the 
NCAA, but the NCAA 
administration has been 
working on cleaning 
things up. The investi­
gations of teams and
_______ drug testing of players
HH is a good start toward 
returning to fair play, 
but there may still be a lot of 
teams out there that are violating 
the rules. They’re hurting a lot 
more than themselves by doing 
that; they’re hurting the institu­
tion of the amateur athlete.
If the professional athletes wish 
to be able to compete in the Olym­
pic games, perhaps they should 
be given their own category and 
let the amateurs compete amongst 
themselves. After all, the games 
were set up to be played solely by 
amateurs. Watch the pros if you 
want to see perfection of competi­
tion, and watch the amateurs if 
you want to see perfection in the 
true spirit of sports.
Swimmers defeat Bethany
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Even without putting forth their best effort, the Carnegie, 
Mellon swim teams beat the Bethany Bisons at Bethany oil 
Saturday afternoon. The highlight of the meet for the Tartans 
was the setting of a new school record in the 400 individual 
medley by freshman Jo Wollschlager. Her time in the event was 
4:57.08.
Instead of training to specifically compete against Bethany,' 
Coach Jim Perkins had the team “swim through” it, using the 
meet as a starting block for the upcoming University Athletic 
Association (UAA) and Presidents’ Athletic Conference (PAC) 
championships.
Although the swim team was just training, the CMU women 
beat Bethany with a score of 100-77. Double winners for the 
women were Wollschlager in the 400 yard individual medley 
(4:57.08) and the 200 yard fly (2:24.7); Glynis Frost in the 1650 
yard freestyle (19:38) and 100 yard freestyle (1:00.3); and Suzy 
Kelly in the 200 yard freestyle (2:14.1) and 500 yard freestyle 
(5:50.8).
The men also did well, winning 93-70. Best season times wer,e 
achieved by Brian Carter in the 100 yard freestyle (:55.3), Pat 
Hensler in the 400 yard individual medley (4:32.6), and Paul 
Moran in the 200 yard backstroke (2:09.4). This victory improves 
their record to 4-0.
According to freshman Debbie Madsen, the team had been 
training with some “high intensity workouts” and people were 
tired. She thought that the “team put in a good effort, and people 
were getting psyched for the meets coming up.”
Doug Vunic also thought that it was a good meet, but said that 
“people didn’t really take it seriously, since we are training for the 
UAA in three weeks.”
The teams host Slippery Rock University tonight at 6:00 pm at 
the pool in Skibo Gym. Saturday, the Tartans travel to John 
Carroll University.
Women keep winning
continued from page 10
lead, but were only shooting 35 
percent from the field. Part of the 
disparity in the scoring was the 
18 turnovers and the 21 percent 
field goal shooting by the Lady 
Presidents. The second half held 
much of the same for both teams, 
allowing Carnegie Mellon to coast 
to an easy 63-47 win.
Freshman Katie Fahey came 
off the bench and dumped in 14 
points to lead the CMU offense, 
with Smith adding 11. Chorgo
and senior co-captain Aimee 
Reber combined for 19 reboUftds.
The Lady Tartans are currently 
ranked fourth in the Mid-Atlan­
tic Region. If they stay in the top 
four, they will be invited to the 
NCAA tournament in March.
Tomorrow night, the Lady Tar­
tans take on the Lady Bisons of 
Bethany College at the Skibo 
Gym, starting at 5:30 pm. Satur­
day, the team travels to Hiram 
for a 5:00 pm contest against the

ME Grads and SAE Seniors start 
the IM basketball season right
By KEVIN BARNEY
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday night, IM bas­
ketball opened its 1989 sports 
Reason. In the minors league, 
Pilam clashed with the ME Grads. 
Pilam took charge early on in the 
Same, taking a 5-0 lead. The ME 
Grads managed to add four points 
to the scoreboard before the first 
period ended.
The ME Grads came alive in 
the second period both defensively 
ind offensively. They kept Pilam 
from scoring throughout the en­
tire second period. Offensively, 
he ME Grads scored ten points, 
iving them a nine point lead at 
he end of the first half.
Pilam started off the scoring in
the third period, putting three 
points on the board. The ME 
Grads replied by shutting down 
the Pilam offense for the rest of 
the period. By the end of the third 
period, the score was 20-8.
The final period witnessed a 
Pilam comeback attempt. They 
managed to score five points, but 
the ME Grads scored nine, win­
ning the game with a final score of 
29-13.
In the intermediate league of 
IM basketball, the SAE Seniors 
collided with the ATO Undertak­
ers. In a battle that started out 
defensively, the first four posses­
sions of each team left the score­
board blank. The SAE Seniors 
scored first, hitting two consecu­
tive shots. The ATO Undertakers

The SAE Seniors took advan­

Black History Month gets 
a strong start on campus
By DARLENE FOZARD
Tartan Staff writer
For several years Carnegie 
Mellon has been recognizing 
February as National Black His­
tory Month.
According to Robert Bowie, a 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus and 
former Spirit President, who is 
helping the coordination of 
events, Black History Month is 
traditionally commemorated by 
Spirit activities.
This year, however, National 
Black History Month will be 
celebrated by more of the cam­
pus community, through a va­
riety of campus organizations’ 
involvement in the upcoming 
activities.
Spirit and the Carnegie Mel­
lon Action Program (C-MAP), 
the minority education support 
group, got together with other 
student organizations like Scot­
land Yard and Student Dormi­
tory Council, and wrote a letter 
to all campus groups, inviting 
them to join in the activities.
So far, some 15-20 organiza­
tions, even residence halls, have 
responded.
Bowie pointed out the impor­
tance of extending the partici­
pation to other student groups, 
saying it would help make the 
“campus more sensitive to the 
issues.”
On a campus such as Carne­
gie Mellon, with a small black 
undergraduate population, and 
with many students who come
from high schools with a small 
number of blacks, there can 
develop an inability to under­
stand the culture and the prob­
lems of the blacks.
One of the other focus points 
of the program will be the twen­
tieth anniversary of C-MAP. 
Some of the activities planned 
are movies, an AB dance (Top 
40 and club music), workshops, 
and several guest speakers.
Spirit President Nicole Austin 
is “very excited because many 
organizations are involved.” 
She added that Black History 
Month will “meet the goal of 
sensitizing the campus to mi­
nority cultures.”
The schedule of events is the 
following:
• Feb. 1: 6 - 8 pm, Tribute to 
Fine Arts in the Faculty Dining 
Lounge
• Feb. 4: C-MAP 20th Anni­
versary

enton organizes student/faculty lunches
BY TERENCE SPIES
Tartan Staffwriter
Director of the University 
Teaching Center Ted Fenton has 
¡reated a great opportunity for 
students, an opportunity to 
.‘hange CMU for the better.
This opportunity exists in the 
University Teaching Center’s Stu- 
lent-Faculty Luncheon Semi­
nars.
These seminars gather together 
students and faculty to talk about 
ssues of importance to the cam­
pus community. Topics will range 
rom the Academic Advising sys- 
em to Cheating in Society and on 
Campus.
Each seminar will open with a 
N to three minute introductory 
peech followed by a discussion 
inch. Says Fenton : “This won’t 
ust be people lecturing.”
The seminar topics were cho- 
pn by members of the Academic 
flairs Council of the Student 
enate and the Educational Af- 
Jii's and Student Affairs Coun­
ts of the Faculty Senate.
The 20 topics these groups 
derated were narrowed to 7 by 
ending questionaires to 35 stu­
nts and 35 faculty members.
% attending the seminars, 
todents will get the chance to 
rteract with faculty outside the 
oom and to participate in 
n&ingthe campus community. 
enton plans to follow up each 
3ssion by getting the results of 
le discussions to the right people 
campus in order to start the 
rocess of change.
an example, Fenton cites the
ham
Academic Advising system. Each 
college works differently, each 
with its own flaws and strengths. 
Through faculty/student interac­
tion, perhaps a solution could be 
found and implemented.
Another example is campus 
cheating. Fenton has done re­
search and prepared a list of in­
genious ways of cheating at Car­
negie Mellon. At the seminar, 
students will be asked to add to 
and discuss the list with faculty, 
resulting in afinal list that will be 
used to improve Carnegie Mel- 
lon’s academic community.
A special seminar has also been 
set up to discuss the issue of stu- 
dènt/faculty relations at Carne­
gie Mellon.
The problem of faculty/ student 
relations can be directly addressed 
at the seminars as students and 
faculty get a chance to meet out­
side of the classroom environ­
ment.
A survey of incoming freshmen 
showed that the majority are 
concerned about relations with 
faculty.
Frank DeVito, a Sophomore 
Industrial Management major, 
says this issue is the primary 
reason he signed up for the semi­
nar.
Fenton hopes the seminar will 
be a good forum to address stu­
dent/faculty concerns and rela­
tions.
Fenton has a personal reason to 
promote interaction between 
students and faculty members. 
Interaction with professors out­
side of classes convinced Fenton 
to study history, a subject he now
sucessfully teaches at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Fenton is emphasizing a “how 
to” approach in the seminars 
about student/faculty relations to 
help students meet professors 
outside of classes.
The “how to” approach will also 
be used in a seminar on Under­
graduate Research, a topic of 
which most students are unaware.
Most departments use under­
graduates in research, aiding the 
department and the student. 
Fenton cited the Biology depart­
ment for having especially good 
opportunities for undergraduates 
in research.
Fenton is very enthusiastic 
about the seminars. He has been 
involved in faculty-only seminars 
previously, with good results.
At Carnegie Mellon, around half 
of the faculty has attended one or 
more of these seminars.
According to Fenton, this is a 
very high percentage relative to 
other programs at comparable 
universities.
The end result of this high at­
tendance is improved teaching at 
Carnegie Mellon.
One thing puzzles Fenton, 
however; only around ten stu­
dents total have signed up for the 
seminars.
It could be argued that students 
are busy, but the lists are full of 
equally busy faculty.
Fenton cannot think of a reason 
why response has been so apa­
thetic. It is vital to have students 
to attend for them to be success­
ful.
The schedule for the seminars
taking place on Wednesday and 
Thursday is as follows :
February 2 and 3 : Are faculty 
members and students here to 
distant from each other?
February 8 and 9 : Academic 
advising : How is it handled in 
each college? How can it be im­
proved?
February 15 and 16: The roles 
of competition and cooperation in 
college life.
February 22 and 23: Research 
opportunities for undergraduates: 
How can we improve them?
March 1 and 2: What do CMU’s 
students think of life here?
March 8 and 9: Cheating in 
the society and on the campus. 
Can Carnegie Mellon buck the 
tide?
March 15 and 16: What mes­
sages do physical space, such as 
dormitory rooms, fraternity 
houses, classrooms, libraries, 
laboratories, faculty and staff 
offices, and the proposed 
University Center send to mem­
bers of the community?
Each seminar is held from 12:00 
to 1:20 in Rooms 105 - 106 Skibo. 
The Lunches will be served at 
12:00 and the seminars begin at 
12:30.
To register for a seminar, or to 
get more information, call the 
University Teaching Center at 
x2896.
Fenton emphasizes that there 
is still time and space to register 
for most of the upcoming semi­
nars.
He adds, “regardless of what 
the economists say, it’s a good 
free lunch.”

Tartan Grill goes self-serve
,Mouo yt WMonIi 'mVMoUi
On Sunday January 29, Mark Snyder gets himself a coke at the new self- 
serve soda machines at the Tartan Grill.
By DONNA A. GREAR
Tartan Staffuoriter
Last semester when most stu­
dents thought of the Tartan Grill, 
the first word that came to mind 
was not “efficiency.”
The long lines evoked emotions 
of anger and dissatisfaction for 
students who wanted to catch a 
quick lunch or merely grab a soft 
drink before their next class.
Not only were students irritated 
by the incredibly long lines and 
slow service, but many were actu­
ally insulted by Dining Service 
attempt to channel the flow of 
students by shutting off the front 
entrance to the Grill, and having 
a “host” instruct them as to which 
line was the shortest.
This semester things seem to 
be quite a bit different. Dining 
Service, along with the help of 
Jim Gurley and the Student Dorm 
Council (SDC) Food Committee, 
has given the Tartan Grill a “new 
image,” which is one of quasi-self­
service.
Lines are shorter, service seems 
to be more efficient, and people no 
longer have to wait in line ten 
minutes for a “small soft drink” to 
quench their thirst.
Jim Gurley, Director of Dining 
Service, said that the whole proc­
ess actually began near the be­
ginning oflast semester when Din­
ing Service was trying to come up 
with a plausible solution to the 
congestive lines, particularly 
around meal time.
The first solution was to shut 
off the rear entrance and channel 
students to their respective lines. 
But it simply did not seem to 
work, and actually angered many 
students and faculty members 
who felt they were capable of 
ushering themselves to the short­
est line.
The employees of the Grill were 
also frustrated by the mass num­
bers of students who flocked to 
the service counter every day 
between the hours of 11:00 and
2:00.
It was impossible for them to 
serve such large numbers quickly 
and with a smile.
It was quite obvious that a new 
and more efficient method was 
needed.
As a result Dining Service, in 
conjunction with the SDC Food 
Committee, began brainstorming 
for ideas.
Their object was to prevent stu­
dents from huddling over the 
service counters in mass num­
bers and to provide quick and ef­
ficient service for the student who 
didn’t have “all day to wait in 
line.”
Several ideas were suggested, 
one of which was a proposed self- 
service line in which the students 
could help themselves to particu­
lar items and beverages. Several 
plans and formats were then dis­
cussed and designed. »
Finally, near the end of last 
semester, Dining Service sent out 
a questionnaire which included a
complete diagram of the proposed 
self-service line in order to solicit 
students for input and ideas oi 
the matter.
It seemed that students were 
three to one in favor of the pro. 
posed plan, and over the break 
the plan was implemented.
Not only was the plan imp]&. 
mented, but apparently it wgJ 
implemented very successfully. 
Both students and the employees 
of the Grill seem to be very pleased 
with the changes and seem to 
think that the new format was no 
great overhaul, but actually lend; 
itself nicely to the new type of" 
service.
It appears that the days of long 
lines and hosts are over for the 
Tartan Grill.
Students, faculty, and CMU em-( 
ployees are much happier and leas 
irritable.
Gurley says that this is simply 
a great example of several group; 
of people working together to bring 
about a long-needed change.
Javi’s diary is exposed, and it reveals all
Editor’s Note: Due to technical 
difficulties, there will be no in­
stallment of “Don’t Worry, Be 
Javi” in this issue. In order to 
compensate for the gaping hole 
that Javi’s mismanagement ofhis 
time has left in our Features page, 
we have decided to publically 
humiliate him by printing a page 
from his diary.
Perhaps now that his deep, in­
nermost thoughts have been hung 
out for the general public to mock 
and deride, he will think twice 
the next time he opts to do home­
work instead of his column.
Dear Diary:
I met a nice.Russian gentleman 
on my way to class; he was dressed 
in black from head to toe and he 
said that there was big money to 
be had in making brief visits to 
the SEI building and bringing 
back some files for him.
1 had to turn him down, of 
course, given that I was late for 
ti$y economics class.
;' He went on to attack me with a 
;modified AK-47 combat machine 
gun. Luckily I had my hate mail 
from last issue on me, and I 
dumped it all on him before he 
reloaded.
As the two tons of postage came 
crashing down upon the nice Rus­
sian gentleman, a postcard came 
fluttering down; the print on it 
read “Dear Javi, I think you are 
great. Love, Mom.”
Once I had dispatched the nice 
•Russian gentleman, I made my
way to the economics lecture. I 
noticed that the Carnegie Mellon 
alpaca herding team was practic­
ing on the Cut.
My heart goes out to them. The 
team has been on dire straights 
ever since their stables got cut 
down to make way for the Ravi 
Gadjki Memorial 
Slab of Blacktop.
Ravi Gadjki is 
Carnegie Mel- 
lon’s most fa­
mous alumnus.
He invented a 
new branch of 
Organizational 
BehaviorTheory 
(OBH) which ex­
plains how travel 
agents make a 
profit,even 
though they are 
able to sell tick­
ets at the same 
price you would 
pay if you bought 
them directly 
from the airline.
At any rate, I 
almost became a 
part of the game 
when one of the alpacas decided 
that I bore a strange resemblance 
to one of its female counterparts. 
Alpaca sex is much more differ­
ent than human sex, but I am 
thankful for the experience.
I was somewhat disturbed by 
the contents of my economics lec­
ture. We were supposed to be 
learning about the stock market
-fpPPlvmla
today.
I was really surprised when the 
professor showed up wearing 
military fatigues and told the class 
that we should invest in firearms, 
freeze dried food, and extensive 
survival training.
After the class was dismissed I 
asked him why 
he didn’t men­
tion the effect of 
the stock market 
on the world 
economy in his 
lecture.
He replied that 
that was exactly 
what he was re­
ferring to.
“Horticultural 
Methods and 
Morals” was also 
somewhat 
strange today. 
Professor 
Voorhees, our 
guest lecturer, 
showed us film 
clips from “Mo­
tel Hell” and 
“The Texas 
Chainsaw Mas­
sacre Part Two.”
After his lecture, Professor 
Voorhees invited the class to a 
nice beef pot-pie dinner at his 
place. I declined, I never liked 
beef pot-pies.
I felt I needed help so I went to 
see my Pascal Genie. He told me 
that I had pretty much exhausted
for an “A” in Intro to Computing 
and went back into his Macin­
tosh. I desperately tried to con­
jure him up once more but I was 
kicked out of the cluster.
Shortly before throwing me 
against the plate glass window, 
the burly P-Con in the fraternity 
shirt told me that he had seen 
strange things before, but seeing 
a guy rubbing a computer 
was perhaps one of the most 
depraved in recent memory.
Since “Horticultural 
Methods and Morals” was 
my last class of the day I 
decided to head for home. I 
like only having two classes 
on Tuesdays and Thursdays, 
it means I can get some rest 
from the eight I have on Mon- 
days, Wednesdays, and Fri­
days.
My eight classes on Mondays, 
Wednesdays, and Fridays all have 
a one-hour overlap on one an­
other, so I miss the first hour of 
each class.
I spend most of my time being 
very confused. I just can’t under­
stand why most people in my 
Shakespeare class do not agree 
with me when I argue that Fortin- 
bras is the most developed char­
acter in the play.
Home is very depressing nowa­
days. I’m not quite sure why the 
hamster is dead. He seemed per­
fectly happy when I first put him 
in the refrigerator. I think I’m 
going to get a fish next, I saw a
market and they seem like the 
perfect pet, not only are they very 
hard and sturdy, but they also 
have a considerably lower body 
temperature. I’m not sure 
whether I’m going to get a sole or 
a whitefish. Maybe smelt, then I 
can get more than one.
After cremating the hamster 
with a can of Stemo that I found
As night fell, I sat down to 
read my mail. My girlfriend just 
left me and decided to say it all 
with a Hallmark card.
Snoopy is doing a little dance 
on the front of the card, above 
him is a legend that reads “Here 
Are Your Walking Papers.” I 
can’t complain, though; I think 
I still I have that alpaca’s phone 
__ number somewhere.

in the basement, I went to my 
room and put my favorite com­
pact disc on the tape deck.
I don’t have a compact disc 
player yet, but the discs look a lot 
nicer than ordinary cassettes. 
Sometimes, when I am in the 
mood, I can sit and look at my re­
flection on a compact disc for hours 
on end.
But I’m not in the mood to look 
at myself on a compact disc today, 
so I popped one of my tapes into 
the tape deck.
My housemates hate my musi­
cal taste, and they claim that 
Geddy Lee looks like a chicken 
and sings like Ethel Merman on 
steroids. Personally, I don’t think 
he looks like a chicken.
An Apology: I wish to | 
make it absolutely clear! 
that the contents of this! 
article are entirely fictional! 
(except for the part with! 
the hampster and thej 
Stemo can) and are in no \ 
way indicative of a prefer-; 
¡¡Z ence toward sexual activ­
ity with fur bearing South 
American animals.
Furthermore I would like to 
say that the Carnegie Mellon 
alpaca herding team is an inte­
gral and much appreciated part 
of the school community, and I 
mean no insult to them in any 
way, shape or form.

Polygamy is not the answer for the ’80s
Dear Zazz:
I’m convinced that monogamy 
,js a failure. If men were allowed 
by law to have two wives, our so- 
-ciety might be better off — and 
women might be happier.
Consider this familiar scenario: 
r A virile businessman’s eyes light 
;,on the sexy chick in his office. He 
„divorces his plain old wife 
„and shares his bed with this 
¦new, young, exciting part­
ner.
The pathetic old wife, who 
^probably helped make the 
,man a success, gets cast 
aside. Maybe she ends up 
...with financial support. But 
the long run, she’s the 
loser in the deal.
The first wife would make 
-out for better if she remained 
-the man’s wife, along with the 
new sexpot.
Let’s face it: Since the dawn of 
time, men have been built to 
handle several women sexually.
Print my letter, Zazz. I think it 
will be a blockbuster for you.
—William Elmerton, Thornton, 
N.H.
Dear William:
Let’s think this through. Per­
haps, the “pathetic old wife” can 
continue to cook and clean for her 
virile husband and his new love. 
Maybe she’ll even deliver break­
fast in bed to the stud and the 
babe from the office.
What an interesting threesome 
they’ll make. Imagine the dinner 
table conversation! Wife No. 1 can
tell Wife No.2 about the 
Studman’s exciting early years. 
And Wife No.2 can provide com­
mentary (for comparison’s sake) 
on more recent sexual escapades.
When Mr. Virile has to work 
late at the office (selecting Wife 
No.3, no doubt), the two wives can 
stay home together, watching 
“The King and I” on the VCR.
Sound feasible, William?
It sounds loony to me. Any first
wife with any self-respect would 
tell her husband to take a quick 
hike off a tall cliff — and to hold 
the bimbo’s hand when he does it.
Men may be physically capable 
of more than one sex partner (as 
are women, don’t forget), but po­
lygamy seems to work only in iso­
lated cases — and usually in so­
cieties where women are 
second-class citizens.
Sorry, but I don’t think 
you’ve hit on a solution to 
the problems of divorce and 
adultery.
—Zazz
Dear Zazz:
I read with interest the 
letter from “Wife of Mama’s 
Boy.” Three years ago, I 
married the world’s biggest 
mama’s boy. His mama played 
the chronic invalid. Yes, she had 
medical problems, but she used 
her ‘conditions’ to bind family 
members in a sick way. Her older 
children rebelled. My husband 
and his younger sister fell hook, 
line, and sinker.
Well, last year, I encouraged 
my husband to take a job promo­
tion several states away. This 
saved our marriage.
We live close to my mother now 
(who is 20 years older than his 
mom). When we moved here, he 
tried to baby my mother into 
invalid status. At first, she loved 
it. Then she finally became 
alarmed and put a stop to it.
Luckily, my husband now rec­
ognizes the unusual aspects of his 
relationship with his mother. Of 
course, she hates my guts.
Mother and son still talk three 
times a week. But that’s fine. The 
$150 phone bills don’t break our 
budget, and she’s at an arm’s 
length.
— Finally A Wife
Dear Finally:
You were smart to move away, 
and your husband is smart to 
recognize his unhealthy devotion 
to his mother.
You’re also doing right by not 
complaining about the long long­
distance phone conversation. It’s 
a small price to pay for having his 
mother a phone call away — and 
no closer.

Roaches are norm
STEVE PETERS
Tartan Staffwriter
Good news for Morewood resi­
dents. Despite rumors to the 
contrary, there are no more 
cockroaches in 
Morewood than 
usual.
Recent rumors 
have been circu­
lating that the al­
leged increase in 
roach infestation 
in Morewood Gar­
dens was due to 
the recent fumiga­
tion of the steam 
tunnels.
According to the exterminat­
ing service that fumigates for 
CMU, the roaches from the 
steam tunnels are travelling 
through the air vents to escape 
the chemicals and heading for 
Morewood Gardens.
After spraying and consult­
ing with residents in A-tower, 
the infestation was related to 
the large American cock­
roaches, usually called water- 
bugs.
According to Housing Direc- days.
tor Tony Martin, whose office is 
located in Morewood, “I haven’t 
heard anything about an in­
crease in cockroaches in More­
wood.”
“Of course, cockroaches will 
always be a prob­
lem, but I haven’t 
received any more 
complaints than 
normal.”
Ida Czarnecki 
from the Housing 
Maintenance Office 
explained that any 
extra cockroach 
sightings were due 
to construction in 
the mailroom, and not fumiga­
tion in the tunnels.
“The cockroaches usually stay 
behind the walls, but with the 
construction they have an easy 
route outside.” She went on to 
add that in fact there had been 
less cockroach complaints than 
in previous years.
If any resident of campus 
housing has a complaint about 
insect infestation they should 
contact the Maintenance Office. 
Fumigations take place on Tues-

If you’re looking for unique 
Spring Break or summer va­
cation ideas, you may want to 
think about Outward Bound 
USA, an organization that of­
fers mostly 3-4 week courses 
for people of all ages and lev­
els of experience in the wil­
derness.
Outward Bound USA has 
schools in North Carolina, 
Maine, Minnesota, Colorado, 
and Oregon, offering over 700 
courses throughout the year.
Courses offered include des­
ert backpacking and can- 
yoneering, canoe expeditions, 
dog sledding, skiing, winter 
camping, sailing, sea kayak­
ing, mountaineering, cycle 
touring, horsetrailing, white- 
water rafting, and trekking.
One multi-element course, 
for example, features back­
packing, rock climbing, orien­
teering and a ropes and initia­
tives course in the Blue Ridge
Mountains, as well as spelunk­
ing and exploring in underground 
Tennessee caverns — nine days 
for $900.
Although the activities are 
physically demanding they sug­
gest you get into shape before­
hand if you are seriously inter­
ested.
Outward Bound stresses that 
it is not a survival school and 
participants need have only av­
erage physical ability.
Outward Bound also encour­
ages personal growth through 
challenges and emphasizes that 
participants “all want to be 
stretched—physically, mentally, 
emotionally — as they all want 
more out of themselves and life.”
Each program includes basic 
phases: a training and physical 
conditioningperiod, an extended 
journey, the solo, the final expe­
dition, and reflection.
Outward Bound provides all 
the equipment and skilled in­
structors (one for every four stu­
dents) teach participants about 
safety and wilderness skills.
In addition, some special 
courses are available for troubled 
youth, as well as alcohol and drug 
abusers.
Outward Bound also offers a 
“Professional Development Pro­
gram” designed to enhance skills 
in the areas of leadership, com­
munications, decision-making, 
teamwork, and risk-taking.
Courses range in duration from 
three days to three months and in 
price from $450 to $5400. Special 
semester-long courses are avail­
able for college students, with the 
possiblity of college credit.
Financial aid is available, based 
on need.
For more information, write to:
Outward Bound USA

384 Field Point Road 
Greenwich, CT 06830 
or call 800-243-8520.
Outward Bound advises you to 
send in your application (along 
with a $50 non-refundable appli­
cation fee) early, as courses fill up 
quickly.

According to an impromptu 
survey by Academic Computing 
(AC) last semester, students need 
more workstations. With demand 
for computers on the rise, AC and 
the administration are struggling 
to meet the need.
During peak hours of usage, a 
consultant may see dozens of 
students in search of a place to do 
their assignments. Many students 
end up waiting until the early 
hours of the morning to get access 
to an Andrew workstation or a 
Macintosh computer.
Much of the problem may be 
due to the administration prom­
ising more than the computer 
industry has been able to deliver.
The cost of supplying worksta­
tions has been prohibitive for two 
reasons. First, the prices have 
not come down as both the ad­
ministration and the industry 
expected.
Second, the specifications for a 
workstation set forth by the In­
formation Technology Center 
(ITC) keep getting bigger.
Even if AC could afford more 
workstations, the question be­
comes one of location. There isn’t 
room on campus for another public 
cluster.
AssistantDirectorofAC Chuck 
Augustine suggested looking to 
the students to help create 
changes in the use of work sta-
tions in certain areas. “For ex­
ample, if a group of students in a 
dorm were to go to Tony Martin 
and request that a common area 
have afew workstationsinstalled, 
the possibility would certainly be 
explored, especially if the group 
of students were large.”
Augustine emphasized that the 
administration and AC will do its 
best to be responsive to the de­
sires of the students. AChasbeen 
responsible for many improve­
ments to the availability and 
speed of computers on campus.
According to usage figures, An­
drew workstations and Macin­
toshes are the most desired pieces 
of equipment on campus.
To help with the performance of 
Andrew, two things have been 
done. First, the file servers con­
taining all the users’ files have 
been upgraded from Sun 2’s to 
Sun 3’s.
Second, the PC servers through 
which PCs and Macs can access 
parts of the Andrew system have 
been upgraded.
For those Andrew users who 
simply need access to their files 
and the services provided by the 
Unix operating system, eight Unix 
Servers were installed last sum­
mer. These machines can be con­
nected to PCs, Macintoshes, or 
plain terminals from students’ 
dorm rooms or from off-campus 
with a modem.
In response to requests for more 
Macintoshes, many were installed
or upgraded in the Hunt Library 
and Margaret Morrison Plaza 
clusters.
In Wean Hall 5201, the cluster 
of IBM-PCs was scarcely being 
used. Consequently, AC filled the 
room, last fall, with IBM 6152s. 
These new machines are capable 
of acting as full Andrew worksta­
tions or as DOS machines like the 
PCs they replaced.
For the future, AC already has 
its sights on the new dorm being 
constructed on the east side of 
campus. Currently, a cluster of 
twenty to twenty-five stations has 
been planned.
To help get workstations into 
the students’ rooms, the admini­
stration has just begun exploring 
the possibility of renting work­
stations to small groups of stu­
dents in their dorm rooms. Mr. 
Mathis explains, “We are inter­
ested in trying a program like 
this because we believe that most 
students cannot afford to buy a 
$7,000-$10,000 workstation. 
Even if you could afford to buy 
one, it may not be a good idea, 
because the workstation market 
is very sensitive to technological 
obsolescence.”
The situation is still not opti­
mal. Students are still waiting in 
lines for machines, but those lines 
are certainly smaller and will 
continue to become shorter as both 
the industry and the administra­
tion get closer to realizing the 
dream of Andrew.

Dear Specs:
I like a girl but I think she has 
a boyfriend. What should I do?
C.S.
Dear C.S.:
Collect evidence that supports 
the case either way. Do a little 
investigating. Give her the “on 
the Market” quiz.
1. Does she wear a jacket that 
says “CMU Football” (softball or 
rugby) regardless of the weather 
conditions or social setting?
2. Does she use the words “us” 
and “we” in profusion?
3. Does she have things in her 
bookbag like a skateboard wheel, 
the new Sports Illustrated, his 
resume (at least 12 copies), the 
minutes from last week’s All 
Brothers Meeting, and some 
chewing tobacco?
4. If you sit down next to her in
the library, does she ask you to 
hand her Mademoiselle?
If you came up with 4 yes an­
swers she has a beau. That will be 
very sad for you. But, either way, 
yes or no, just remember that you 
are participating in one of life’s
two great tragedies: getting what 
you want, or not getting it at all. 
Specs
Dear Specs:
My boyfriend comes over in the 
middles of the night and sleeps in 
my bed. He never sends me flow­
ers anymore, or takes me out to 
dinner. I think this is becoming a 
habit, and boring besides. 
Unhappy
Dear Unhappy:
Ask not what he can do for you,
but what you can do for him.
Specs
Dear Specs:
I’m a little worried about catch­
ing diseases from my friends. I 
often drink from other people’s 
cups during parties. I also kiss 
girls on the mouth that I don’t 
know very well. I don’t even want 
to think about where they've been.
What should I do?
Dear WSID:
Remember a good many things 
go around in the dark besides 
Santa Claus. So, cut down on all 
the cup swapping and mouth 
kissing.
Kissing on the mouth is a very 
70’s, Richard Dawson-way ,of 
saying hello anyway. You don’t 
want to look hopelessly dated 
when you're at a party.
Try and keep that facet of your 
personality from your friends. 
DON'T do the hustle, discuss 
Gerry Ford, or dress like Sonny 
Bono.
You could give yourself away. 
Instead, wear black, muse upon 
the deficit, give the old boys a 
thump on the back, and when you 
walk up to say hello to the young 
girls give them another drink and 
act confident.

PBT presents WM8 Or8Iu OIuiyFbbbCreating a character in modern ballet
\
By LORI MAURER
Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
Brian Bloomquist, who will play 
Tom Buchanan in the Pittsburgh 
Ballet Theatre (PBT) production of 
Great Gatsby next week, doesn’t 
his character. Nonetheless, he 
looks forward to playing the “nasty 
guy” of the ballet for the second year in 
a row.
Bloomquist may not have much in 
common with the shallow character 
he plays in Gatsby, but he does 
bring the character to larger than 
life form, as evident in the com­
pany’s rehearsals of the ballet 
that I saw. Bloomquist does 
seem to share Buchanan’s self- 
assurance, although his confi­
dence comes from a dedica­
tion to dance rather than the 
assurance of a wealthy back-
Last year, The Great Gatsby was the 
first major ballet to have its world pre­
miere with PBT. All performances sold 
out and for the most part it received ex­
cellent reviews, except for some com­
plaints that the production lacked sub­
stance and relied more on costumes and 
scenery than the actual dancing.
Bloomquist says that this year he 
hopes “[Gatsby ] will be a deeper produc­
tion. It was new last year so it was hard, 
as in any production, to create the depth 
that makes it a classic.” He will also at­
tempt to create more depth in his 
characterization of Tom Buchanan, 
a character difficult to portray be­
cause of his shallow and static na­
ture.
Bloomquist describes Bu­
chanan as “a great example of 
the upper-crust American who 
got where he is the old way, 
the money way. Life is not 
worth as much to him. He’s 
relatively unintelligent 
but very opinionated. 
His experiences are 
pretty limited so he’s 
a picture of a rich 
and ugly America. 
He’s not the most 
likable character 
and certainly not 
the most di­
verse.”
To portray 
Buchanan
through dance, Bloomquist relies on body 
language and mime. He explains his ap­
proach to Buchanan as communicating in 
the way that “[some] people ... are pretty
adept at judging a person when ---------------
they first enter a room, just by 
the way they carry them­
selves.”
Because Bloomquist is the 
first, and also the only, dancer 
to ever play Buchanan, he is 
relatively free to interpret the 
role as he sees fit. Bloomquist 
explains, “There’s always more 
of a disadvantage in playing a 
classical role — a role that has 
been done for many, many HSWn 
years and that has been per­
formed by notable performers.
It’s almost a relief that [Gatsby]_____________
is new.” i
There were many difficulties 
in bringing Gatsby to the stage because 
the strength of Fitzgerald’s prose had to 
be brought to the audience through dance 
rather than words. Bloomquist says that 
“the visions that are put together on stage 
try to create some of the moods you might 
imagine from the book.”
Despite the problems inherent in bring­
ing any work of prose to ballet form, 
Bloomquist finds Fitzgerald’s detailed 
descriptions helpful because “the charac­
ters are very carefully written about and 
described so they’re all very unique, but 
still, you can’t fully get across [the feeling 
of Fitzgerald’s] poetry.”
The choreography is also, to use 
Bloomquist’s terms, “contemporary bal­
let, with an emphasis on being natural. 
They’re supposed to be looking like they’re 
street life. It’s more dance than classical 
ballet.”
Bloomquist feels that the mood of the 
piece would not come across with the ri­
gidity of classical ballet and finds that the 
present, freer form of choreography makes 
it easier to bring across the nature of the 
novel and of the characters.
This year’s production of The Great 
Gatsby marks Bloomquist’s seventh sea­
son with PBT. Although he feels that 
Gatsby is certainly a step forward for the 
company because it was a world premiere 
last year and because it will tour this year, 
Bloomquist feels that much of the com­
pany’s repertoire is neglected by audi­
ences and critics alike.
Bloomquist says, “I wish the company 
could be seen doing a variety of its reper-
best dancing has been in the repertoire. 
A lot of people miss out on those things 
and the super, super dancing because 
they just see the full-length works.”
“There’s always more of a disad­
vantage in playing a classical role 
Q I role that has been done for 
many, many years and that has 
been performed by notable perform 
ers. It’s almost a relief that OIuiyt
mighty buck has been really important 
lately. I think it [The Great Gatsby] is a 
symbol of the yuppie thing, of that part of 
America.
----------------- “The way that we pres­
ent the book is that the 
waste and decadence ap­
parent in the novel keeps 
going on, it doesn’t stop. 
We throw everything away, 
we’re such a garbage soci­
ety but we keep going on 
like nothinghappened, like 
it’s always party time. It’s 
an American tragedy, 
there’s no doubt about 
that.”

Bloomquist sums up his admiration and 
respectfor the Pittsburgh Ballet by say­
ing, “We have a lot of great dancers and 
we also do a lot of great ballet.”
Unlike his 
character in the 
ballet,
Bloomquist has 
succeeded 
through hard 
work and dedi­
cation to dance 
since he was 17 
years old, rather 
than trying to 
take the easy 
way out as 
Buchanan does.
Bloomquist de­
scribes himself 
as “a good pro­
fessional who 
wants to per­
form as much as 
possible. That’s 
really where we, 
as dancers, pol­
ish our craft.”
Over fifty 
years after The 
Great Gatsby 
was originally 
published,

that “it still ap­

larly with the

stration. The al- Brian Bloomquist talks about the challenges of ballet.
Gottfried plays Pitt
By AMANDA COHEN
Tartan Staffwriter
Too much. Just like Gilbert 
Gottfried says in the Oh, Henry! 
candy bar commercials, “Th- 
this stuff is intense!!” Gottfried’s 
show at Pitt last Thursday 
proved him to be even more in­
tense than the candy he sells.
Gottfried’s comedy is like 
nothing you’ve ever seen be­
fore, unless you’ve seen his 
\ whole act. He yells from begin­
ning to end, occasionally break­
ing from his anxious squawk to 
do great impressions. The eyes 
stay shut, the mouth stays open, 
and the hands fly all over the 
place. If Billy Idol had been a 
Borscht Belt/Catskills comic, he 
would have been Gilbert 
Gottfried. Your Jewish night­
mare.
The short bits he gets to do on 
television don’t show the beauty 
°f his strange, driving segues 
built from repetition. Gottfried 
will take a phrase like “a turtle 
without moisture is nothing” 
and keep saying it, bending it 
slowly until it breaks into an­
ther routine. The device is 
similar to Monty Python’s 
Dead Parrot” sketch, where the 
comedy comes from the vocali­
zation and overemphasis.
The Pitt show used more of a 
comedy club format than the 
comedy concert that Carnegie 
Mellon gets. Gottfried had an 
°Pening act and an emcee, both 
whom are from Pittsburgh. 
Shang “Powercat” Forbes, who 
now lives in L.A., got good re­
sponse as the middle act. One of 
his strengths is his ability to 
mix the mundane with the taboo 
— Forbes knows why Charlie 
Brown can’t get laid. In his act, 
Forbes invited an audience 
member to try and mimic his 
groin flexing, and found that 
the student could shake “little 
Elvis” almost as well as the 
Powercat could.
Frank Niccotero, a local per­
former who started doing com­
edy last June, stretched his 
emcee set into 20 minutes. His 
style is purely conversational, 
as though the entire audience 
were in his TV room watching 
him make remarks on all the 
commercials. He admits that 
most of his material is inspired 
by television, unlike the previ­
ous generation of comics who 
made observations on real life.
Despite a few groans and si­
lences, Niccotero said the Pitt 
show was his best yet. “For a 
college crowd, they were very 
well behaved,” he said. Nic­
cotero is 19 years old and tak­
ing a break from school to work 
part time and do comedy. He’ll 
be emceeing one-night shows 
in Indiana, Illinois, and Ohio 
over the next few months.
After the show, the Pitt Pro­
grams Council held a reception 
for Gilbert Gottfried where they 
were able to get his autograph 
and I was able to try and talk to 
him about his comedy career. 
Luckily, Gottfried does not yell 
when he is off-stage, but he’s no 
less insane.

1000 Airplanes plays Pgh.
By JIM WILLIAMS III
Tartan Dossier Editor
“... part Freud, part Kafka, and 
part Steven Spielberg.”
Time
“...a multi-media performance 
piece.”
In Pittsburgh
The setting was a dark base­
ment, video glowing from a 27" 
Sony, audio pulsating from a high 
wattage stereo. In the VCR was 
one of the strangest ‘movies’ that 
I had ever witnessed. It was a 
showing of Koyaanisqatsi.
I was being subjected to a super­
sonic montage of images; my eyes 
ached from trying to follow the 
high-speed motion of cars trav­
elling at maddening speeds from 
nowhere to nowhere; hills and 
country turning into cities; cities 
turning from day to night to day 
in seconds; every commercial that 
I’d ever seen compressed into a 
five minute clip; all culminating, 
after 87 minutes, in a vivid mush­
room cloud which was, if not 
beautiful, at least relaxing in its 
serenity and peace.
So went my introduction to 
Philip Glass, the composer respon­
sible for the pervasive and haunt­
ing soundtrack to the movie 
Koyaanisqatsi (an American In­
dian word meaning life out of 
balance). In addition to his movie 
sound tracks (Koyaanisqatsi, 
Powaaqatsi, Mishima), Glass 
composes symphonies and operas, 
writes for theater, dance, and 
chorus, produces albums, and 
tours with the Philip Glass En­
semble. Everything he does is
marked by stylistic and thematic 
trademarks.
Described by Time as “an eight­
ies Haydn” because of his thirst 
for work, Glass’s prolific creative 
output is as staggering as it is far- 
reaching. In the past ten years he 
has produced a myriad of musical 
endeavors combining aspects of 
theater, opera, and popular cul­
ture that have created a genre all 
their own.
Glass’ latest work, 1000 Air­
planes on the Roof, will be per­
formed in Pittsburgh on Febru­
ary 3. The piece is the most recent 
product of a remarkable modern 
artist who has inspired critical 
acclaim and popular controversy 
through his minimalist style and 
unconventional approach.
Among Glass’ previous works 
are three operas based on histori­
cal figures: Einstein on the Beach,
a disturbing and successful treat­
ment of the life of Albert Einstein 
and the apocalyptic novel On the 
Beach', Satyagraha dealing with 
Ghandi’s early years in South 
Africa; and Aknahten focusing on 
an 14th century B.C. Egyptian 
Pharaoh.
Glass has also composed the 
operas The Photographer, The 
Fall of the House of Usher (mod-

Winterblast hits Skibo...Blasted!
Last Friday night, Naked Raygun, Live 
Skull and Bitch Magnet rocked to a sold-out 
crowd in the Skibo ballroom.
The show got off to a late start, and the 
waiting crowd filled up Grey Matter, with 
people arriving from as far away as Cleve­
land and New York. The doors finally opened 
at 9 pm, one hour later than they were sup­
posed to, and the Ballroom filled up quickly. 
By the time Bitch Magnet, the opening 
band, finished their set, the room had 
reached its 600-person capacity and 
doorkeepers were forced to turn a large 
number of people away.
Despite the crowds, the evening was free 
of incident. All three bands put on superb 
shows that gave the uninformed a good 
overview of the post-punk music scene - 
Naked Raygun and Live Skull marked the 
two boundaries of punk-pop and noise-rock. 
Even the pit during Naked Raygun’s set 
was small and well-behaved, following the 
hopes of the bands and promoters, and 
topping off a highly successful evening.

eled after Poe’s chilling tale), and 
The Making of the Representative 
for Planet 8, based on a novel by 
Doris Lessing. Glass has worked 
with such famous names as thea­
ter artist Robert Wilson, composer 
Robert Moran, and choreographer 
Twyla Tharp.
His diversity and style haven’t 
always been rewarded; his de­
tractors claim that much of his 
work is unoriginal and monoto­
nously repetitive. After years of 
^varying response and critical 
•challenges, it may be that Glass 
'has finally struck performance 
art pay-dirt.
. Glass has teamed up with young 
playwright David Henry Hwang 
and set designer Jerome Sirlin to 
produce the surrealistic psycho­
drama 1000Airplanes on the Roof. 
-This collaboration is so diverse, 
^talented, and avant-garde that 
;its creative product is without 
precedent. Even those critical of 
Glass’ previous ventures proclaim 
that 1000Airplanes is so striking 
and complete that it must be 
witnessed.
The story is a collective work 
pieced together by the three art- 
ists-nouveau from stories of alien 
invasions taken out of tabloid 
news. The play focuses on M. 
(played by Patrick O’Connell), 
who is abducted by aliens for 
medical experiments.
The aliens examine the physio­
logical and psychological differ­
ences between themselves and 
their human representative, and 
before they release M. they warn 
him that he should forget all he 
went through. Unfortunately, M. 
tries to share his experience with
the world. Unable to convince 
anyone of his experience, he slowly 
goes insane. The play’s message 
lies in the anonymity and aliena­
tion that results from M.’s extra- 
worldly experience.
M. is disillusioned by his en­
counters with the aliens. The 
thrust of the piece is his failure to 
convince anyone of his experi­
ences. At the pinnacle of the nar­
rative he questions his percep­
tion of the situation and cries 
“perception is the fifth dimension.” 
By the end, M. is reduced to a 
half-sane tragic hero dismissing 
the ‘reality’ of his experience and 
dreading memories of the “night­
mare.” The title comes from M.’s 
description of the pounding in his 
head.
1000 Airplanes exists as a 
metaphor for the alienation and 
disillusionment that result from 
distinctions drawn by dominant 
ideologies in our society. M. is an 
eighties ‘everyperson,’represent­
ing human plight in a world beset 
by skepticism and cynicism, preju­
dice and bigotry.
This subject matter is not 
unique for Hwang, most famous 
for his Tony Award-winning 
Broadway play M. Butterfly. Ed­
ith Oliver of The New Yorker 
declares the Hwang is the most 
“audacious, imaginative and 
gifted young dramatist at work in 
America today.”
In both M. Butterfly and 1000 
Airplanes Hwang tackles, issues 
of imperialism, racism and femi­
nism in such an elegant manner 
that his work has been described 
as poetic. To fully understand 
Hwang’s work, you must experi­
ence it.
1000 Airplanes is escalated 
beyond an intriguing story to 
“multi-media performance” status 
by its other contributors. The 
sound is Glass at his aesthetic 
peak, and the stage is a three- 
dimensional dreamscape com­
plete with holographic images for 
set pieces and a monumental 
series of films, slides, and projec­
tors keeping the set in motion — 
a set, like the main character, in
a constant state of transition and 
angst.
Sirlin’s set represents a culmi­
nation of his talents in the fields 
of architecture, photography, and 
set design. His most recent works 
have been the elaborate sets for 
Wagner’s Ring Circle operas, and 
the set for Madonna’s Who’s That 
Girl world tour in 1987. Two of 
Sirlin’s performance pieces, 
seehear and RareArea, have
toured the United States and 
European museum circuit.
The show ranks among the most 
unique performances ever, with 
the contributions of the three 
artists woven into a fabric of com- 
mentaiy and sensory experience 
more titillating than a Prince/ 
Michael Jackson/U2 triple bill. 
Experience the direction that 
theater/opera is taking; 1000Air­
planes is contemporary music
theater at its best.
1000 Airplanes on the Roof 
appears for one performance on 
February 3 at 8:00 PM. There <#e 
still tickets available at Heinz EdE 
Box Office, all Kaufmann’s arid

The Tartan: Okay, just briefly 
state who you are so we can be 
sure.
Gilbert Gottfried: All right. Dr. 
Richard Kimball.
TT: How do you maintain such 
a high energy level throughout 
the show?
GG: A high-fiber diet.
TT: There must be more to it 
than that.
GG: And particularly tight 
shorts.
TT: For real?
GG: Yes. That’s it totally.
TT: Okay, then...
GG: I take enemas with seltzer.
TT: They’re not gonna buy this 
back at the paper.
GG: I’ll talk to the editor in the 
morning.
TT: There must be something 
more to it.
GG: That’s what most people 
say after they’ve seen my act.
TT: Where does it come from?
GG: When will it go back? That’s 
mainly what people ask me.
TT: Where is the wellspring? 
Where does the energy come from?
GG: Where is the Weltshpring? 
I used to be an opening act for 
Weltshpring. This was back in

When they go “Ladies and Gen­
tlemen, Gilbert Gottfried,” it 
seemed like the best thing to do. I 
just happened to be falling into 
situations where curtains open 
up and they yell my name out.
TT: Did you ever think you’d do 
anything other than comedy?
GG: Tonight.
TT: You’re not making this easy
“My God, whatever happened to 
him?”
TT: This is a fear you have, that 
people will go “Whatever hap­
pened to Gilbert Gottfried? He 
used to be so great in those com­
mercials.”
GG: Yes. That’s it exactly.
TT: Where does the style come 
from?
GG: Where does the what?
_I’ll wind up doing episodes of Love 
Boat, à think. I’ll be like, 300 pounds 
and doing segments on Love Boat, 
and people will go ‘My God, whatever 
happened to him?”’
—Gilbert Gottfried
GG: Uh huh.
TT: I’m just trying to get one 
serious answer. If you weren’t 
doing comedy today, what would 
you be doing?
GG: Ummm...
TT: I don’t mean today like 
“today.” I mean, as a concept, 
today.
GG: Today as a concept? That’s 
pretty hypothetical to me. I never 
quite thought of today as a con­
cept.
TT: We’ll go into concrete, then.
GG: Okay.
TT: Today, you performed at 
the William Pitt Union. If you 
hadn’t done that tonight, what 
would you have done?
GG: I’d be on the phone with the 
heads of the college going “Why 
aren’t you here?”
TT: Can I possibly get one 
straight answer?
GG: Yes.
TT: Well?
GG: That was it. See? You blew
it.
TT: Okay, we’ll talk future.
GG: I think there will be large 
buildings living on air, and space­
ships will travel in fifteen min­
utes to Mars and back.
TT: Your future.
GG: My future will be exactly 
the same.
TT: Movies? Albums? TV? 
Anything?
GG: I’ll wind up doing episodes 
of Love Boat, I think. I’ll be like, 
300 pounds and doing segments 
on Love Boat, and people will go
Vt
TT: How did you develop into 
whatever that was we saw to­
night?
GG: Um, lack of a sense of 
humor, I think it was, basically.
TT: Lack of a sense of humor?
GG: No, I don’t know.
TT: Was there any point in your 
career when you said “this is the 
direction I’m choosing in comedy” 
or “this is the direction comedy 
has chosen for me?”
GG: If comedy had chosen my 
direction I’d have been out of it 
years ago.
TT: So how did you get here? 
And don’t say you took a —
GG: I took a plane.
TT: Okay, then, tell me about 
your writing process.
GG: My writing process? Pen­
cil, paper... occasional typewriter.
TT: No computers?
GG: Computers? Yeah, Etch-a- 
Sketch. I write all of my material 
down on Etch-a-Sketch. File it for 
later.
TT: Oh, they’re very handy. 
We’re developing the latest in 
Etch-a-Sketch technology up at
CMU. We’re very proud of it. 
Maybe we could set you up with 
some software if you’ll give us a 
decent interview. One answer is 
all I ask. I’ll take anything.
GG: Uh, five to six years ... yel­
low-green. It’s not the question 
you asked, but those are very 
serious answers.
TT: What other projects are you 
working on now?
GG: Three-story buildings, five- 
story projects, projects with a 
playground. Yeah. Projects near 
a subway.
TT: Okay, tell me about your 
work with National Lampoon.
GG: My work with National 
Lampoon? I bring them stuff, they 
say “this isn’t disgusting enough,” 
I re-work it. They say “I’m sorry, 
this still has some good taste in 
it.” But they have to take it home 
and erase anything that has any 
sense of decency.
TT: You don’t like what they do 
to it?
GG: Oh, no, it’s okay.
TT: It’s okay?
[We were interrupted by a fan 
who brought Mr. Gottfried an Oh, 
Henry! candy bar.]
GG: Oh, no. Do you know I still 
haven’t seen those Oh, Henry! 
ads.
TT: You don’t watch TV at all?
GG: Not me. No, when I’m on I 
turn [it off) right away.
TT: Oh, you just run and scream 
in fright. Gee, I thought they were 
pretty funny.
GG: Yeah, I just watch the Joe 
Isuzu guy.
TT: Anything else you want to 
say, coherently?
GG: Uh, drive home safe.
TT: One more question. Are you 
aware that the “Catskill Comic” 
is out?
GG: Yeah. Well, when he comes 
back, have him give me a call.

You don’t need a llama when you’ve got a pickup
For two years now my buddy 
Buster Peebles has been trying to 
;get me to invest in llamas. I’m not 
making this up. Buster’s got this 
. ranch outside of Divide, Texas, 
that he’s turned over to a herd of 
about 50 llamas, and he’s breed­
ing new ones all the time. If you’ve 
Sever seen one, they look 
like a giant goat that’s been 
bred to a fat jackrabbit.
They stare at you like Tony 
Franciosa hopped up on 
"cocaine, and if you move 
too quick around em, they 
snap their neck straight up 
like a rattlesnake. It’s like some 
animal that God didn’t quite fin­
ish.
Anyhow, Buster was in town 
!last week for the Fort Worth Fat 
iStock Show, where he shows his 
llamas and tries to win blue rib­
bons so he can charge some idiot 
$10,000 for some llama sperm. 
Ten years ago nobody in Texas 
had any llamas, but today there’s 
27 million llamas in West Texas 
alone, and you know why? “I think 
these llamas are gonna TAKE 
OFF in the next 10 years,” Buster 
told me. “One of these female 
breedin llamas brought a hun- 
nerd thousand dollars last year.”
I don’t know if you’re acquainted 
with any of the Peebles, or maybe 
you know some llama breeders 
¡yourself? but what that means is, 
everybody’s been talking too much 
-about llamas down at the barber 
jshop. “Somebody’s gonna get rich 
off these things,” they been say­
ing, “so might as well be US.”
(I need to take time out right 
here to talk to those of you who 
read this column every week and 
1 know that sometimes I make stuff 
-up. I swear to God, ranchers all 
over Texas are walking around 
with beer guts hanging out over 
their belts, prancing proudly for­
ward, clicking their tongues and 
yanking on a leash attached to an 
alpaca sweater with legs.)
So I went over to Fort Worth 
with Buster to watch this year’s 
Llama Exposition. See, the prob­
lem with the llama market at this 
particular point in time is that 
people keep walking up to Buster 
and the other llama breeders and 
saying, “So what do you use them
things for.”
And Buster says “Pack animal.” 
And they just kinda nod and 
chew a little bit.
“State parks department use 
llama pack trains to go up in the 
desert mountains.”
“Uh-huh,” they say.
“And , course, they make great 
pets for the kids.”
And then they nod and chew 
some more.
So what’s needed is a llama 
competition to show people just 
EXACTLY what the highly 
trained llama can do. And so that’s 
what they did. The llamas had to 
go through a 10-step obstacle 
course, including walking over a 
log, ducking under a steel rod, 
walking across a piece of plastic, 
and climbing into a horse trailer. 
It was truly awe-inspiring. 
Buster’s prize llama is named 
Oprah Winfrey, and Oprah was a 
little persnickety when it came to 
the grueling back-up-through-a- 
gate competition. So Buster only 
got fourth place this year.
“Buster,” I said, after it was all 
over, “tell me again what you’re 
gonna use these llamas for. It’s a 
pet, right?”
“This ain’t a pet,” Buster said. 
“This llama’s an INVESTMENT.” 
“Y’all are all just gonna sell 
these llamas to one another, aren’t 
you? You’re just gonna trade em
back and forth.”
“Luanne and me are gonna 
RETIRE on the money we make 
from these llamas. Joe Bob, do 
you realize this is one of the oldest 
pack animals in the world? Roy­
alty used to have em.”
“Buster, people got PICK-UPS 
now! People don’t need pack 
animals!”
“That’s the kind of nega­
tive thinking that’ll keep 
you from ever amounting 
to anything in life.” 
“Buster, I think I’d rather 
own a hunnerd thousand 
dollar pick-up than a hunnerd 
thousand dollar llama. If the 
llama dies, you can’t sell it for 
parts.”
I guess that was about the 
moment when Buster cleaned my 
clock. We used to be pretty good 
friends, too. Buster, if you’re read­
ing this, I’d like my hat back, even 
if it’s all stomped flat.
Speaking of demon-faced crea­
ture with no apparent purpose, 
“Night of the Demons” is a new 
flick just out from the guys who 
made “Witchboard,” and it’s your 
basic Spam-in-a-cabin Halloween 
plot, about some California nerd- 
sters who use “party” as a verb all 
the time and think it’d be fun to 
pop some brewskis in an aban­
doned funeral parlor that was 
built on an ancient Indian burial 
ground where 17 or 18 people 
have died horrible grisly deaths, 
including one Indian brave who 
was found “Gnawing on a pa­
poose.” He probly choked to death 
on the leather. After about half 
an hour of plot, the cast starts 
tuminginto sex-crazed grasshop­
per-head “Solid Gold” dancers, es­
pecially Angela, who wriggles 
around on the floor, like Tina 
Turner while her body forms into 
a toadmonster. And, of course, 
everybody who enjoys sex MUST 
DIE.
No “Witchboard” but fairly
decent. Eight breasts. Eight dead 
bodies. Seven undead bodies.

Kinkade, as Angela, for doing a 
Stevie Nicks dance routine as a 
demon-possessed sex monster; 
Linnea Quigley, as Suzanne the 
demon, for doing the whole movie 
in a pink tutu hiked up to here, 
seducing a fat guy, and saying 
“Maybe I’m in the mood for pork 
tonight”; Hal Havins, as the ob­
noxious fat guy necessary to the
plot of every horror movie, for 
saying “I can’t LIVE without my 
music”; Alvin Alexis, as the terri­
fied son of a preacher, best actor 
in the film, who trembles through 
the whole movie and says “We’re 
dead; we’ve all died and gone to 
hell”; and Joe Augustyn, the 
writer, for the line “Would you 
like a fudge log?”

says check it out.

Forbes Gallery hosts printmakers
By JULIETTE BORDA
Special to The Tartan
A show of works by Deborah 
; Barkun and Andy Scott, both 
; seniors majoring in printmaking,
. opens today at the Forbes Gal- 
' lery.
Deborah’s works 
include woodcut 
prints, lithographs, 
intaglio prints, and a 
few paintings. She 
enjoys the technique 
of woodcut, since the 
process is controlled 
entirely by hand, 
from the cutting to 
the printing of the 
ink. The process of 
woodcut is self-ex­
planatory: these prints are made 
by hand-cutting a design into a 
block of wood and printing the 
relief. If more than one color is 
desired, then more wood must be 
cut away and another color is 
printed on top of the first one with 
the new, revised relief. Deborah’s 
woodcuts have a rich, textural 
look. Black is a key color in her 
work, and its dark value allows 
lighter, rarely used colors to gain 
greater emphasis.
A recurrent theme in Deborah’s 
work is architecture as a symbol 
for human emotions. She trav­
eled to Sheffield, England last 
year, a town whose background 
in industry and present atmos­
phere are much like Pittsburgh’s.
The architecture of Sheffield (com­
bined with personal feelings) 
inspired much of what goes into 
her prints as well as the influence 
of built structure as an artistic 
symbol.
Intaglio is a relief process much 
like woodcut, except that instead 
of wood, one uses a metal plate, 
and instead of cutting with a tool, 
one etches with acid to create the 
relief. Deborah will show a gray- 
blue intaglio print with simple,
abstract forms.
Andy Scott could not be reached 
for an interview, but he will also 
show woodcut prints, lithographs, 
and paintings. Andy’s work deals 
with the figure, even though the 
forms are highly abstracted. One 
lithograph depicts a 
crowd of heads and 
shoulders, balanced by 
a large void next to it, 
with a few simple 
lines.
Lithography is a 
printing process 
whereby an image 
drawn on a stone or 
plate with a greasy 
crayon, then is 
sponged over with 
water and rolled with 
ink that sticks only to the greasy 
image and not the rest of the wet 
stone. The plate or stone is then 
placed on a press and the image is 
printed onto paper.
Deborah and Andy will have a 
closing reception for their show 
this Friday from 7 to 9 pm. All are 
welcome. For further details, call 
the Forbes Gallery at 268-2081.
Juliette Borda is the publicity 
director of the Forbes Gallery.
Winterblast inspires gloating
By DAN BIDWA
Tartan Staffwriter
I told you it was going to be 
huge. Everyone told you it was 
going to be huge. But 
noooo, you figured that 
Winterblast was going to 
be another of those AB 
things in the Ballroom, 
and that you could show 
up whenever you wanted 
to. Tell that to the 600+ 
people that were waiting 
in Grey Matter at 9:00, 
and the 600 people who made it 
inside.
Really, folks, there were a 
bunch of people there, with the 
majority coming from places 
other than CMU. And those 
people from elsewhere paid to 
get in, so I don’t want to hear 
any shit from students about 
how “their activities fee paid 
for this, and it’s an outrage that 
CMU students can’t get into 
their own activity.” Simple fig­
ures, folks: the show cost about 
$3000. About $2000 was col­
lected at the door. That means 
$1000 left over. Now, since only
about one-third of the crowd was 
CMU students, things work out 
pretty evenly, don’t they? And 
don’t give me any shit about 
having to wait and then not get­
ting in. I talked to at least seven
Music Music Music 
In 
Review
people who had driven over four 
hours to see this show, and then 
couldn’t get in. If you didn’t get in, 
you should have shown up ear­
lier.
Winterblast was probably the 
first time a lot of people on cam­
pus were exposed to “punk rock.” 
This might be a bit outdated, but, 
just in case anyone tries it again, 
there’s a few things you should 
know. That mess of people near 
the stage during Naked Raygun’s 
set is called a pit. What the people 
were doing was called slamming 
or slam dancing. Now, the basic 
idea of slamming is that you do it
only with other people that want 
to. This does not include every­
one in the front of the crowd. 
Also, getting up on top of the 
crowd might be fun, but isn’t 
such a hot idea, especially when 
it’s really crowded (like 
Winterblast) or when Se­
curity is paranoid (ditto) - 
it’s j ust asking for the show 
to get shut down. Slam­
ming can be a lot of fun, 
but you have to realize that 
not everyone’s into it, and 
when it’s the people run­
ning things that aren’t into 
it, things stop running.
If you liked what you heard 
Friday night, finding more of it 
isn’t too hard. Both Live Skull 
and Naked Raygun have new 
vinyl out, Snuffer and Jettison, 
respectively, with more ex­
pected soon — Live Skull is 
recording now, and Naked 
Raygun’s new LP should be out 
in March. Bitch Magnet only 
has one album out right now, 
called Star Booty, that you can 
get from Roman Candle Rec­
ords (146 E. College, #3, Obe.r- 
lin, OH, 44074).

By DAWN BROZONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
With the success of video rent­
als and the virtual guarantee that 
any new movie will be in the video 
stores within months after its 
release, many of us are getting 
more and more comfortable wait­
ing for the video and not minding 
so much if we miss a particular 
movie on the screen. Well, one of 
the best pictures of 1989 will soon 
be in the theaters. Don’t wait for 
the video. You’ll want to see this 
one with an audience.
Torch Song Trilogy opened Off- 
Broadway in 1978 as a play writ­
ten by and starring Harvey Fier- 
stein. It moved to Broadway in 
1981 and received the Tony Award 
for Best Drama. Fierstein received 
the Tony for Best Actor. Now he 
brings his pláy to the screen, 
reprising his winning role as 
Arnold Beckoff, a homosexual 
man struggling with the pressures 
of family, love, and finding accep­
tance.
The film opens in Brooklyn in 
1971. Arnold is making his living 
as a female impersonator in a 
club, portraying his character 
Virginia Hamn. One night his 
friend Murray (Ken Page) encour­
ages him to visit a gay bar, and 
there he meets Ed (Brian Ker- 
win). The confrontation is as 
uncomfortable as it can be when 
any two people meet for the first 
time, but this situation has a twist: 
Ed makes it perfectly clear that 
the only thing on his mind for the 
night is sex.
The relationship having sur­
vived their first night together, 
'Arnold soon falls completely in 
¡love with Ed.: They carry on con- 
¡tentedly until Arnold accidentally 
Idiscovers that Ed is also seeing 
iwornen. Arnold, heartbroken, 
ends the relationship when he 
ifiilly realizes Ed’s lack of com­
mittment.
The movie jumps to Christmas 
¡1973. Arnold is still working at 
the club, where he then meets 
Jthe love of his life,’ Alan (Mat- 
'thew Broderick). Arnold is a bit 
hesitant this time around, and 
Alan literally has to follow him 
around the oity to get his point 
across (which leads to a hilarious 
jscene in a women’s clothing store 
Where Arnold and the boys from 
the club are shopping for their 
act). This time the love is real. 
Alan moves in with Arnold, and 
they live their lives so completely 
that the only thing missing is a 
child. Eventually they decide to 
fill out adoption papers, uncer­
tainly, but hopefully.
A powerful force in this movie is 
Arnold’s mother, referred to only 
as Ma, and wonderfully played by
Anne Bancroft. We see her at 
various times throughout the 
movie, continually sparring with 
her son on the issue of his sexual 
status. She doesn’t seem to take 
her son seriously; she believes his 
homosexuality is a phase that he 
will eventually grow out of. As a 
result, Arnold and his mother 
argue frequently. There were a 
few instances during their quar­
rels where the words flew by so 
quickly I wanted to reach out and 
push ‘rewind’ and ‘playback’ to 
make sure I heard everything 
correctly.
An extremely moving and 
thought-provoking scene occurs 
at the grave of Arnold’s father, 
where they argue once again as 
Ma belittles Arnold’s com­
mittment to Alan. It ends with 
her running from Arnold, as he 
yells after her with what he sees 
as the opinion of most hetero­
sexuals: “Queers don’t love, and 
those that do deserve what they 
get.”
I never had the pleasure of 
seeing the play, therefore I can­
not comment about the transition 
from Broadway to the big screen. 
However, Torch Song Trilogy as 
a film definitely stands up on its 
own merits. The first half hour is 
full of marvelous, witty humor 
that isn’t seen very often these 
days in films. The humor also 
serves to make the audience more 
comfortable with a very touchy 
subject: homosexuality.
The jokes served their purpose 
in 1978, but even more so now 
with the horror of AIDS hanging 
over us. The disease has brought 
out from hiding many more who 
now publicly oppose homosexu­
als and feel they have no right to 
function in our society; these 
people characterize homosexuals 
as abnormal.
Harvey Fierstein creates for us 
a very real, very normal man. 
Arnold exists in the only ways he 
can in a society that shuns him 
and forces him to create his own 
world. At times Fierstein does 
seem a bit too comfortable in the 
part, and some of his reactions to 
the people around him are a bit 
exaggerated. When he sings in 
the club, it sounds disturbingly 
like he is gargling with sand. But 
it all comes together as the fun of 
the character, which is a large 
part of the film, as well as the 
serious Arnold, who struggles 
through various traumatic expe­
riences.
The supporting cast is brilliant. 
Matthew Broderick proves ten 
times over that he can never be 
characterized as a young actor 
who gets work largely because of 
a pretty face. For the most part, 
Broderick’s Alan is warm and
Pulitzer nominee to visit campus...

loving to Arnold, and it actually 
surprised me as I found myself 
beginning to root for the relation­
ship (which is something I thought 
I’d never do).
Broderick portrayed David, the 
teenager Arnold eventually 
adopts, in the original Off-Broad- 
way production, for which he 
received an Outer Circle Award 
and The Villager Award.
Brian Kerwin as Ed gives a 
strong performance as a man 
trying to come to terms with his 
homosexuality. Kerwin previ­
ously portrayed Ed in a Los Ange­
les production of Torch Song Tril­
ogy, winning a Dramalogue and 
an L.A. Drama Critics Circle 
Award.
Also worthy of mention are Ken 
Page, absolutely hysterical as 
Murray, and Eddie Castrodad as 
David, who jovially but affection- 
ally calls Arnold “Ma.”
So don’t wait to rent the video.
Torch Song Trilogy is definitely a 
movie you should see opening 
night. There are few pleasures 
that compare to seeing a side- 
splittingly funny film with an 
audience. There are also few 
experiences like being presented 
with a view of homosexuality you 
may have never encountered be­
fore. Don’t be surprised if it stays 
with you for quite a while after 
you leave the theater.

Torch Song Trilogy will be 
opening in Pittsburgh in early 
February. Check local listings for 
times and venues.
In a week otherwise devoid of 
classical music activity, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Music Department plays 
host to composer Michael Schelle, 
1988 Pulitzer Prize nominee and 
Composer in Residence at the 
Jordan College of Fine Arts at 
Butler University. The 
composer was also named 
Distinguished Composer 
of the Year (1988) by the 
Music Teachers National 
Association. He will give 
a lecture Thursday dur­
ing the 12:30 convocation 
and a concert of his works, 
played by the composer and stu­
dents and faculty from the de­
partment, will take place that eve­
ning.
Schelle’s studies took place at 
Villanova, Butler, the University 
of Hartford (Hart School of Mu­
sic) and the University of Minne­
sota, as well as private studies 
with Aaron Copland. In addition 
to the Pulitzer nomination and 
numerous prizes for his composi­
tions, his honors include entries 
in both Who’s Who in American 
Music and Baker’s Biographical 
Dictionary of Musicians. His 
works have been performed by 
such ensembles as the Minnesota 
Orchestra, the Buffalo Philhar­
monic, the St. Paul Chamber 
Orchestra and the Pittsburgh 
New Music Ensemble, and by
conductors like Neville Marriner 
and Michael Gielen. His works

semble and orchestra, and re­
cently he is involved in writing a
Classical Outlook
. with Çlms Fect^ay
large scale work for the Kansas 
City Symphony.
Thursday’s lecture is entitled 
“Everyday Inspiration Everyday” 
and is aimed at dispelling the 
Romantic Myth of “inspiration.” 
Schelle will use recorded excerpts 
of his music to illustrate the talk. 
In addition to Music Department

is invited to the free lecture, at 
12:30 in Alumni Concert Hall, 
College of Fine Arts.
At the evening concert, “The 
Many Faces of Michael Schelle,”

Dave Pellow, and Heiko 
Kallenbach will play Rac­
ing with Rabbits for per­
cussion. Faculty member

Magnetizzare, a chamber work for 
five players which included dra­
matic directions as well as nd- 
tated music. This concert is also 
free and open to the public and 
will be held in ACH at 8 pm.
If Michael Schelle’s name is not 
one that has been heard often 
until now, it is one certainly wortiji 
noting, for his increasing reputa;- 
tion as a first rate composer. Hik 
visit is made possible by a grant 
from the Composer Performance 
Fund.

Time of Your Life is at the Pittsburgh Playhouse
By ROBERT CUCUZZA
Tartan Staffwriter
Slice-of-life plays are very diffi­
cult to write and perform. Life, 
seen on a moment-to-moment 
basis, is just not very interesting, 
and certainly not worth the price 
of a theatre ticket. To keep an 
audience captivated for three 
hours with a day in the life of 
ordinary people is quite an 
achievement. John Amplas’ pro­
duction of William Saroyan’s The 
Time of Your Life at the Pitts­
burgh Playhouse does this with 
sensitivity and sparkle.
Saroyan’s play is set in a San 
Francisco saloon in 1939, just 
prior to the outbreak of World 
War II. The usual crowd of sail­
ors, whores, and lost souls shuffles 
in and out of the bar, their hearts 
overflowing with hopes and 
dreams. Their lives revolve 
around Joe, a “loafer” who makes 
hope for the hopeless with his
offbeat personality mix of whimsy 
and common sense. The play is a 
series of vignettes that are woven 
together like a tattered afghan, 
combining hope and despair into 
one thread. Dreams go haywire in 
the end of the play, and the world 
seems to fall apart at the seams, 
leaving the characters with de­
spair and fragments of lost hope. 
At the time The Time of Your Life 
was written, America was shad­
owed by the memory of World 
War I and dreading the onset of 
World War II. Since then, these 
outside influences have been for­
gotten and the characters have 
taken precedence.
Let’s face it, the play is depress­
ing and it runs nearly three hours. 
An amateur production could be 
deadly and even a professional 
troupe might have trouble. De­
spite these inherent difficulties, 
Amplashas created a delightfully 
melancholy atmosphere. The 
scenes are played against a back­

Citizen Kane
Orson Welles made his motion picture debut by 
writing, directing, and starring in what is almost 
universally considered the greatest movie éver made. 
This biography of newspaper publisher William 
Randolph Hearst taught movie directors how to 
make a film and moviegoers how to watch one. The 
story begins in 1940 as Charles Foster Kane (Welles) 
lies on his deathbed and speaks his final word: 
“Rosebud.” Magazine reporter Jerry Thompson 
(William Alland), thinking this utterance to be the 
secret to Kane’s mysterious life, embarks on a mis­
sion to learn all he can about one of the richest and 
most powerful men in the world. If you see only one 
movie this weekend, this is it.

Fbidmy, Febbumby 4 Midnight Run
The best “buddy movie” of 1988. Charles Grodin 
plays a Los Angeles accountant who embezzles mil­
lions ifrom the mob and then runs to New York. 
Robert De Niro is an ex-cop/bounty hunter out to 
collect the $100,000 price on Grodin’s head. De Niro 
captures Grodin easily enough, but the cross-coun­
try trek turns out to be more than he bargained for. 
Their jburney is complicated by the F.B.I., who want 
Grodin to testify; the mob, who want Grodin dead; 
and another bounty hunter who wants Grodin for 
himself. A great action-comedy with lots of memo­
rable lines. Directed by Martin Brest.

Smtubdmy, Febbumby 5 Coming to America
Another Eddie Murphy romp. This time out he 
plays the prince of a small nation who has just 
celebrated one of those “now he is a man” birthdays, 
and his father (James Earl Jones) has arranged his 
marriage. But Murphy wants to find a wife on his 
own. So he and confidant Arsenio Hall leave home 
for the first time and travel to Queens, N.Y., where 
they await true love. The laughs come from their 
naïveté and lots of inside jokes. This film boosted 
Hall’s career into the stratosphere, and he steals the 
show from Murphy. The film’s got more than its 
share of laughs, but don’t expect too much. Directed 
by John Landis. If you see only one movie this 
weekend, see one of the others.

Sundmy, Febbumby 6 The Philadelphia Story
Katherine Hepburn stars as a rich socialite who 
kicks out her husband (Cary Grant) and prepares to 
marry the “perfect” man (John Howard). Things go 
awry, however, when Grant shows up at the wed­
ding with a Spy magazine reporter (James Stewart) 
and photographer (Ruth Hussey). A classic comedy 
worthy of its stars. Directed by George Cukor.

drop of characters indulging in 
their dreams; pianos, dancing, 
pinball machines. The mood he 
has created is captivating in its 
naturalness. Some of the best 
moments are those where no lines 
are said, and the bar takes on a 
life of its own in the silences. At 
times the intense melancholy on 
stage works detrimentally on the 
audience, and some parts of the 
show drag, but overall the atmos­
phere is effective.
This is a character play and 
most of the performances are 
strong. Kaymond Laine is engross­
ing as Joe, the central figure. He 
remains seated throughout al­
most the whole show, the world of 
the bar revolving around him. 
Laine nurtures the power of the 
character through this stability. 
His voice is soothing, sobering 
the frantic behavior of the others 
around him.
David W. Butler is powerful as 
Nick, the bartender, and he pos­
sesses a natural quality that in­
stantly evokes a realistic feeling. 
Robin Walsh is strong and sensi­
tive as Kitty Duvall, the down 
and out ex-burlesque girl. She 
creates an intricate character with 
contrasting qualities ofinnocence
and experience. Kurt Carley cap­
tures the naivete of Tom, Joe’s 
disciple, but his prevailingly 
negative attitude detracts from 
the strong bond between him and 
Joe and makes him tiresome to 
watch.
Other notable performances 
include Gustave W. Weidl as Kit 
Carson, the crotchety spinner of 
tales and Zachary (William) Mott
as Harry, a natural born dancer 
but not-so-natural bom comedian. 
These actors have created likable 
and distinct characters who add 
flavor to the scenes.
William W. O’Donnell’s set 
captures the warmth and dilapi­
dation of a tavern in 1939 San 
Francisco. William Saroyan’s 
solid representation of life in ’30s 
America is a homage to the hopes
and dreams of every American 
This production recreates the play 
with accuracy and sensitivity, if 
you have the chance, this sho\vjs 
an excellent choice.
The Time of Your Life runs until 
February 12 at The Pittsburgh 
Playhouse. Performances are 
Tuesday through Saturday at 8 
pm and Sunday at 2 pm and 7 pm
