Waste code update will affect renters  
Peduto talks OnePGH at CMU panel
ADAM TUNNARD
News Editor
This past month, the Pittsburgh 
City Council unanimously passed 
changes to municipal waste code 
619 that will primarily affect rent-
ers and landlords in Pittsburgh. 
The changes will go into effect 
this summer. According to the 
of?ce of Erika Strassburger, who 
spearheaded the changes, the “ul-
timate goal is to make it easier for 
people to recycle and hopefully 
increase the amount of material 
that is recycled.”
Among the changes made, 
new provisions now require 
landlords to “provide both waste 
and recycling storage containers 
for their tenants, these must be 
watertight with close ?tting lids,” 
and to provide Pittsburgh speci?c 
recycling literature “to tenants as 
part of leases,” said Moira Egler, 
Councilperson Strassburger’s 
Chief of Staff, in an interview 
with The Tartan.
In addition to these changes, 
violations of the new waste 
code will now result in notices 
being sent to both the tenant 
and landlord and the mandate to 
recycle will be made more explicit 
in the code itself.
Small recycling changes have 
been clari?ed, as stated in the 
Pittsburgh Public Works waste 
regulations website.
These include the ability 
to place recycling out in blue 
translucent bags and the 
codi?cation of set out times as 
being “no sooner than 6 p.m. the 
day prior to collection, no later 
than 6 a.m. day of collection,” and 
bin retrieval times as being “by 10 
p.m. the day of collection.”
The legislation was an effort 
made in partnership with the 
City of Pittsburgh Bureau of 
Environmental Services and with 
the of?ce of Pittsburgh Mayor Bill 
Peduto. It passed unanimously in 
the council with few amendments.
The only pushback on the 
legislation came from a collection 
of residents that raised concerns 
about the code’s initial bin retriev-
al time, which was that bins had 
to be removed from side streets 
no later than 7:00 p.m. Some 
residents, like those working 
odd hours or with afternoon and 
night shifts, would be negatively 
affected by this set time.
Addressing these concerns, the 
latest possible retrieval time was 
pushed back to 10:00 p.m. in the 
now-passed legislation. Previous-
ly, the legislation did not enforce 
a speci?ed removal time.
In response to the prospect of 
rent increases due to the mandate 
that landlords provide waste 
bins, Egler stated that the of?ce 
“[hasn’t] heard concerns” about 
such an issue, and that “the con-
tainers are pretty reasonably 
priced.” Egler then noted that the 
mandate is speci?cally for “apart-
ment buildings with ?ve and fewer 
units,” and that these changes are 
“common sense provisions that

“Numbers do not speak for 
themselves,” said Sir David 
Spiegelhalter, a world-renowned 
statistician, to a crowd of near-
ly 100 professors and students 
who had gathered in McConomy 
Auditorium to hear him speak. 
“The stories we tell, the way 
they’re packaged makes all the dif-
ference to their emotional impact.”
We are living in the age of 
data. Technology plays a bigger 
role in people’s daily lives than 
ever before, and many of society’s 
core issues can be reframed as 
statistical problems. Yet it is also 
the age of misinformation, and 
the ?eld of statistics is facing more 
challenges than ever before.
Sir David Spiegelhalter’s lec-
ture on Monday, April 22, was 
the second installment of the Ste-
phen and Joyce Fienberg memo-
rial lecture series. Stephen Fien-
berg, who died of cancer in 2016, 
was the head of the Carnegie 
Mellon statistics department. 
He was highly respected and 
in?uential in the ?eld of statistics 
for his dedication to applying 
statistics for societal good. Joyce 
Fienberg, Stephen Fienbergs’s 
wife who perished in the Tree 
of Life synagogue shooting last 
Oct., worked as a researcher 
at the Learning Research and 
Development Center at the 
University of Pittsburgh and was a 
great supporter and friend of the 
statistics department at Carnegie 
Mellon.
“Steve sets a high bar for how 
statistic are communicated,” 
said Sir David Spiegelhalter. In 
his lecture, he focused on how 
statistics are manipulated for 
sensational and persuasive means. 
Spiegelhalter serves as a chair 
at the Winton Centre for Risk 
and Evidence Communication, 
which is part of the University 
of Cambridge’s department of 
mathematics. In his career, he 
has published over 200 papers 
and written several books. He has 
spent the last decade focusing 
on the application of statistics 
to everyday life, appearing in 
numerous T.V. specials on BBC 
and CNN to discuss issues re-
lated to probability and climate 
change. In 2014, he was knighted 
for his service to medical statistics, 
but he jokes that his greatest 
achievement is an appearance on 
the game show Winter Wipeout.
Spiegelhalter explained the 
pipeline of statistical evidence. 
Initially, data is collected by 
researchers and statisticians. 
Their research is then passed on 
to journals and the commissioners 
of the research, all of whom may 
have “selection biases.” Then the

On Saturday, a gunman 
entered a synagogue in Califor-
nia shouting anti-Semitic slurs, 
and opened ?re with an AR-15 
style gun, as reported by The New 
York Times.
The shooting left a 60 year old 
woman dead, a rabbi wounded in 
his hand, and two others injured 
by shrapnel wounds.
It occurred on the Sabbath, 
and the last day of Passover, 
a week-long holiday that 
celebrates Jewish liberation 
from slavery.
The shooting took place at 
the Chabad of Poway. Poway is 
a suburban town about 25 miles 
north of San Diego.
The shooting occurred exactly 
six months after the Tree of Life 
synagogue shooting that jarred 
Pittsburgh and the Jewish com-
munity at large on Oct. 27, 2018. 
It is the most recent in a series of 
deadly attacks in houses of wor-
ship, including the mass shoot-
ing in mosques in New Zealand 
last month and the church bomb-
ings in Sri Lanka last week.
The gunman has been 
identi?ed as John Earnest, a 
19 year old from San Diego. He 
?ed the synagogue after the 
shooting, but soon after called 
the California Highway Patrol 
to report his location and was 
apprehended.
Police are reportedly 
investigating a manifesto that 
was posted on 8chan before 
the shooting, which is ?lled 
with white nationalist conspir-
acy theories and racist slurs, as 
reported by The New York Times.
Last year, a study released 
by the Anti-Defamation League 
found a 57 percent increase in 
anti-Semitic incidents.
Jonathan Greenblatt, the 
chief executive and national 
director of the Anti-Defamation 
League, told The New York Times 
that “This was a pointed attack 
on Chabad, on the visible Jewish 
community here, and this is a 
collective attack on all Jewish 
communities — this is anti-Sem-
itism unleashed.”

Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto 
is continuing his effort to get 
his stalled fund for social and 
sustainable action in Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, off the ground.
A panel this past Thursday 
titled “The City of Pittsburgh, 
OnePGH, and Alignment with the 
Sustainable Development Goals” 
brought this discussion to Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus. Speaking 
alongside Peduto was the head 
of Heinz College in Washington, 
D.C., Amb. Sarah Mendelson, 
serving as the panel moderator, 
and panelists Leah Lizarondo, 
Heinz alum and CEO of 412Food 
Rescue, Jerry MacCleary, CEO of 
materials company Covestro, and 
Anthony Pipa, Senior Fellow at the 
Brookings Institution.
The talk was framed around 
Pittsburgh’s interpretation of the 
Sustainable Development Goals 
(SDGs): 17 markers developed 
by the U.N. as a guide for global 
growth. These goals, Peduto 
claims, align with the 10 areas 
developed by the Rockefeller 
Foundation and the City of 
Pittsburgh for the city’s 12-year 
resiliency plan. These, in turn, be-
came Peduto’s proposed OnePGH 
fund, which would funnel money 
from the city, local nonpro?ts, 
and corporations to organizations 
working toward 47 planned proj-
ects.
Peduto emphasized the 
importance of action on the 
city level, citing a “vacuum of 
leadership in Washington.” 
However, according to Peduto, 
OnePGH is neccesary because the 
City of Pittsburgh does not have 
the leverage to act on its own. 
“[The projects] can’t happen un-
der old models. Old models are 
city government,” said Peduto.
“We don’t have the capacity 
to address hunger and poverty,” 
said Peduto, “but if we create a 
separate organization that then 
helps those that are on the ground 
addressing hunger and homeless-
ness, and being able to use that 
organization to prop up the non-
pro?ts throughout the city and 
this region, then we can get to our 
goals together.”

Beto O’Rourke talks guns, healthcare, and ICE in Schenley Plaza 
EVANGELINE LIU 
Staffwriter
Democratic presidential 
candidate and former U.S. 
Representative Beto O’Rourke 
visited Pittsburgh on Wednesday 
as part of his 2020 presidential 
campaign. In the tent at Schenley 
Plaza, he hosted an event with 
supporters that was a mixture 
of town hall and rally. He is the 
?fth candidate to visit Pittsburgh 
since the campaign season began, 
following, most recently, a visit by 
Sen. Amy Klobuchar on Sept. 18.
According to an Aug. Franklin 
and Marshall poll, about 1 
percent of Pennsylvanians support 
O’Rourke’s candidacy.
Standing on a black box in the 
middle of a crowd, he started off 
his speech with some personal 
stories, including the story of his 
last visit to Pittsburgh that was 
25 years ago, and the fact that he 
had just celebrated his 14th wed-
ding anniversary. Recalling how he 
?rst met his wife on a blind date, 
O’Rourke remarked that “this was 
15 years ago, before Tinder was 
invented, and we didn’t have the 
chance to swipe left or right.”
He transitioned to re?ecting on 
his roots in El Paso, TX. El Paso, as 
a city bordering another large city 
in Mexico, is home to a large in-
ternational community. O’Rourke 
remarked on the number of El 
Paso schools now implement fully 
immersive bilingual education.
He reminded the crowd that 
El Paso is one of the safest cities 
in America to rebuke the current 
president’s rhetoric about how 
immigrants allegedly increase 
crime rates in America.
O’Rourke then turned to his 
many criticisms of the Trump 
administration’s treatment of 
immigrants at the southern border. 
“No one sends their 8-year-old 
daughter [alone] on a 2,000 mile 
journey unless there is no other 
choice but to send their daughter 
on a 2,000 mile journey,” O’Rourke 
said, to cheers.
O’Rourke then pivoted to 
discussing the shooting at a 
Walmart in his hometown, where 
the shooter allegedly targeted 
Mexicans because he was angry 
about what the shooter termed a 
“Hispanic invasion” of Texas, and 
about the large-scale ICE raid in 
Mississippi that targeted low-in-
come migrants.
From there, O’Rourke 
addressed his proposed gun 
control, domestic terrorism, and 
immigration policies. To cheers, 
he reiterated his intention to im-
plement a mandatory buyback 
of assault-style ri?es because he 
believes there is no reason for 
civilians to own military-style 
weapons, and to make combating 
domestic terrorism a top priority 
for federal law enforcement. One 
of O’Rourke’s key issues on the 
campaign has been this gun con-
trol rhetoric.
O’Rourke told the crowd that 
ICE raids were sending a message 
of fear, and said that he intended to 
remove this fear aspect from these 
immigrants’ lives by legalizing 
undocumented immigrants and 
providing a path to citizenship for 
the young people brought to the 
US illegally as children known as 
Dreamers.
He brought up the drought in 
Guatemala that was forcing many 
families to escape north, and the 
fact that extreme weather events 
like it will become more common 
as the planet warms from human 
activity. “[The drought is] not 
caused by God or Mother Nature, 
but by you and me, our emissions,” 
he asserted.
He highlighted that places 
located at lower latitudes such as 
El Paso may be too hot to support 
life in the future if anthropogenic 
global warming goes unchecked. 
To combat this, he proposed that 
if he is elected as president, he 
would have a plan to implement 
carbon sequestration — processes 
that remove carbon from the 
atmosphere and thus reduce the 
percentage of greenhouse gases 
in the air — over the next decade. 
O’Rourke told people that as 
Americans, we should be taking a

Attendees packed the 
McConomy Auditorium last 
Thursday as Michelle Alexander, 
author of the bestseller The New 
Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in 
the Age of Colorblindness, led a 
discussion about mass incarcera-
tion and racial justice. Also on the 
panel were Heinz College professor 
Alfred Blumstein and Department 
of History postdoctoral fellow 
Anthony Pratcher.
Blumstein started: “The U.S. 
used to have an incarceration rate 
of about a hundred for a hundred 
thousand... we are now about ?ve 
times that level.” He discussed the 
?ndings in his ?eld of criminology 
showing that 30 percent of the 
prison population’s disparity be-
tween white people and people 
of color could be demonstratively 
explained by bias against people 
of color rather than by people of 
color committing more crimes.
Alexander acknowledged the 
staggering amount of people 
in jails and prisons as a serious 
problem but discussed how she 
and other activists refer to mass 
incarceration as “a much larger 
caste-like system” that includes 
people on parole and formerly in-
carcerated people who effectively 
live as second-class citizens. She 
also noted that while she ?ghts 
to eliminate racial inequality in 
the system, she is “interested not 
in eliminating the disparities but 
eliminating the system itself.”
Alexander was less personally 
interested in the statistics around 
bias in the justice system and more 
concerned with what she calls 
a racist political dynamic in our 
country.
She said, “the rate of violent 
crime that we see in impoverished, 
segregated, jobless, ghettoized 
communities is a function of the 
fact that we as a nation have 
chosen to disinvest in those 
communities.”
Alexander was heartened to 
see so many people turn out to her 
talk, and said that old-fashioned 
protest can create new political 
realities that are starkly different 
from the current ones. She cited 
the impact the Movement for Black 
Lives and the Ferguson protests 
have made. She pointed out that 
the issue of mass incarceration has 
become bipartisan to a degree. For 
example, she noted, The First Step 
Act, a criminal justice reform law, 
passed with bipartisan support 
this April.
Pratcher brought up the topic of 
prison abolition as an alternative 
to prison reform. Alexander was 
quick to point out that prison 
abolitionism is not just about 
closing prisons, but about creating 
a democracy where prisons and 
jails “are not required, where we

keep students, faculty and staff 
appraised of crime on and around 
campus. 
Students received an email 
this past Friday alerting them to 
the existence of the report, which 
provides updated crime statistics 
for 2018, but is mostly comprised 
of resources and reporting 
procedures for victims.
The 2018 crime rate, obtained 
by dividing the number of crimi-
nal offenses by the total number 
of campus community members, 
has gone down to 0.0191 with 353 
reported incidents, from the 2017 
rate of 0.0217 with 395 reported 
incidents, but does represent 
an increase over the 2016 rate 
of 0.0182 with 326 reported 
incidents.
The  graph below represents 
crimes reported at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus, 
crime statistics for other cam-
puses can be found with the full 
report.  Infrequently reported 
crimes were omitted from this 
graph, such as murder and man-
slaughter, both of which had no 
reports over the past three years.  
Notably, few drug arrests 
were made, while there was a 
number of highly reported drug 
offenses that resulted in a disci-
plinary action. The reverse is true 
for alcohol-related crimes: there 
were more arrests than the less-
serious disciplinary actions. The 
complete report can be found at

leadership role to “make sure we 
don’t cook this planet beyond 
supporting life.”
The rest of his speech touched 
on the key issues that Democrats 
have taken on: discrimination, 
healthcare, a $15 minimum wage.
He also proposed a healthcare 
plan with a mixture of public and 
private plans. He addressed the 
need to end discrimination in the 
workplace by amending the Equal 
Rights Amendment, and criticized 
the fact that it is legal in Texas 
and other states to ?re someone 
for their sexual orientation and 
to prohibit same-sex couples from 
adopting children.
O’Rourke rallied his supporters 
by ending with a statement on 
the high incarceration rate in 
the US, saying that the “war on 
drugs became [a] war on people,” 
especially minorities. He called 
for reparations to be made to 
descendants of slaves and for the 
nation to acknowledge both the 
deeper legacy of slavery and how 
it still disadvantages minorities to 
this day.
The former Texas congressman 
spent much of the rest of the 
event taking questions from 
the audience. One man in a 
wheelchair asked about the pro-
posal for paper ballots to prevent 
election hacking, noting that some 
people like him cannot pick up a 
pencil and asked if there would be 
accommodations for disabilities. 
In response, O’Rourke promised 
to enact a provision for disabled 
people to be able to get help in 
voting and even promised to name 
it after the man who asked the 
question.
A young woman from El Paso 
asked the candidate about gun 
control and re?ected on her 
worries after the mass shootings 
in both El Paso and Pittsburgh, to 
which O’Rourke shared a story he 
had heard of a Mexican woman 
who refused to play traditional 
Mexican music in public after 
the shooting in El Paso. He 
also seemed to express that he 
understood how some gun owners 
liked the shooting power of 
assault-style weapons, but noted 
that there have been gun owners 
who told him that although they 
were supporters of Trump, they 
also wanted to keep our children 
safe and understood the premise 
behind O’Rourke’s gun buyback 
proposal.
In response to a question about 
how to pay for this buyback, he 
proposed taxing capital at the 
same level as income, raising the 
corporate tax rate to at least 28 
percent, and ending the foreign 
wars America is involved in to save 
the money otherwise spent on 
these wars.
He concluded the event by 
greeting some supporters in the 
front and snapping the usual 
crowd sel?es.

have developed alternative forms 
of justice...where we respond with 
care, compassion, and concern 
rather than punitive approaches.”
She discussed how the current 
system fails survivors of violent 
crime, who often don’t get closure 
from seeing their assailant sent 
off to prison, and fails to redeem 
the imprisoned people, who 
spend time in a traumatizing 
environment that doesn’t improve 
them.
Alexander proclaimed the 
unfairness in that white business 
owners are making a pro?t selling 
marijuana in states where it’s 
legalized while black people were 
torn from their homes for doing 
the same thing. She argued that 
reparations should be paid not just 
for slavery but for the impact of the 
drug war on communities of color.
She also noted that the same 
infrastructure is used to lock up 
black people and undocumented 
immigrants and that both of 
their mistreatments are justi?ed 
by similar political rhetoric that 
scapegoats members of both 
groups as dangerous.
Alexander recounted what 
inspired her to write The New Jim 
Crow. Growing up, she noticed her 
white classmates in high school 
and college weren’t arrested for do-
ing hard drugs and later went on to 
grad school and lucrative careers, 
while young people of color caught 
smoking marijuana were penalized 
and told they would never amount 
to anything.
Alexander ended by discussing 
the broader political implications 
of the drug war and racism.
“The drug war was declared 
with black folks in mind, but it’s 
a war that’s harmed people in 
communities of all colors. Today 
in our politics, I think we can see 
all kinds of examples of the way 
that white folks hurt themselves by 
their own racism.” She believes that 
America doesn’t have many welfare 
policies like universal healthcare 
because “things like welfare and 
federal support for education, for 
healthcare, for housing and the 
rest got tainted through the racial 
politics of the Southern Strategy.” 
To some degree, she argues, white 
Americans don’t support policies 
that would bene?t them because 
they would also bene?t people of 
color.
When it comes to enacting 
change against the injustices she 
describes, Alexander said, “It’s go-
ing to take activism and it’s going 
to take protest...In whatever walk 
of life one is in there is a role that 
one can play in contributing to this 
movement.”

Google contractors in Pittsburgh vote to unionize
Rebecca Enright/Art Editor
Pittsburgh is a city with a rich 
history of labor strength and 
unionization. An important step 
in the future of Pittsburgh workers 
was made last Tuesday when 
Google contract workers voted to 
unionize.
The workers, contractors for 
Google working directly for a 
tech ?rm named HCL America, 
voted 49-24 to unionize with 
Pittsburgh’s United Steelworkers 
(USW). Now, they await approval 
from the National Labor Relations 
Board to certify the vote.
As contract workers, they don’t 
exactly work for Google. But 
the nature of their work means 
that their jobs are extremely 
similar to those of direct Google 
employees. They’re typically 
college-educated, yet don’t 
receive bene?ts such as paid sick 
days and are often paid as little 
as $40,000 a year for their work. 
They also lack job security, 
with workers saying that 
abrupt ?ring is also a 
constant worry.
Over half of 
Google’s workforce, 
or about 135,000 
employees, are like 
the HCL America 
contractors: they 
work on Google 
projects, but 
are receive less 
compensation 
due to their 
temporary 
status, and do 
not get the same 
bene?ts that direct 
Google employees do. 
In joining with USW, HCL 
employees who voted for 
the union hope that better 
representation can address 
these issues.
USW’s ?rst efforts to 
bring workers together 
and collectively bargain 
for better contracts came 
at a much different time 
in labor history. The tech 
workers of today certainly 
aren’t working in hundred-
degree factories, tapping 
blast furnaces and routing 
slag. However, even though 
the physical working 
conditions are inherently 
different, the goals of 
unionization are essentially 
the same: better conditions 
and better compensations.
For steelworkers in and 
around Cleveland, OH, 
where USW was founded 
in 1942, conditions were 
dire. It took several years to 
unionize the steelworkers, 
and after frequent strikes 
and other efforts, workers 
were able to collectively 
bargain for things like a 
$5 daily wage at Carnegie-
Illinois Steel in 1937, and 
eventually, pension plans 
for workers at Bethlehem 
Steel in 1949.
Those efforts might 
have looked different 
than unionization efforts 
of today: there was no 
dramatic strike or stakeout 
with HCL workers. But their 
demands remain similar to 
labor struggles of the past.
Johanne Rokholt, an 
HCL employee working at 
Google’s Pittsburgh campus 
said, “currently, the power 
dynamic between workers 
and the company is imbalanced. By 
standing together as a union, we 
can balance that power dynamic, 
and turn the monologue into a 
dialogue to get the fair treatment 
we deserve.”
Ben Gwin, HCL employee 
and union organizer, told the 
Pittsburgh City Paper, “we just 
want a voice in the process... and 
to be able to negotiate our own 
contract and have a more equitable 
workforce for everyone.”
Google employees in the past 
couple of years have led the 
technology workforce to recognize 
the value of their own labor. A 
walkout last Nov. that questioned 
the company’s handling of cases 
of sexual harassment led to 
policy change. Internal backlash 
and mass resignations prompted 
the company to not renew its 
contract with Project Maven, 
the controversial Department 
of Defense project, a branch of 
which is currently operating out 
of Carnegie Mellon’s army AI task 
force.
At Google, these efforts have 
stopped short of unionization. 
Even if Google employees 
unionized, it would not 
necessarily lead to unionization 
of the majority of workers at the 
company, since contractors, like 
those at HCL, outnumber the 
company’s full-time employees. 
According to a tweet by 
the organizers of the 
Nov. walkout, this arrangement 
“permit[s] Google to abdicate its 
responsibility to the majority of its 
workforce.”
And HCL workers for Google are 
far from the only laborers working 
without full-time status bene?ts: 
in our economy, thousands drive 
for Lyft or Uber without bene?ts, 
warehouse workers for Amazon 
are frequently employed by temp 
agencies instead of corporate 
for lower costs, and content 
moderators for Facebook, who 
must view the most horrible and 
disturbing content on Facebook 
for hours on end, are mostly 
contract workers who make 
around $28,000 a year.
Intertwined with 
Pittsburgh’s deep history of labor 
organizing is the backlash that 
these efforts have faced. The 
Homestead Strike is famous 
not only for the new organizing 
techniques employed by the 
workers but also the bloody 
retaliation by the private security 
force, the Pinkertons and the state 
police.
In the modern gig economy, 
the temporary workers historically 
brought on as scabs and 
strikebreakers now constitute a 
large section of the workforce. 
Those workers are now beginning 
to recognize that their labor, 
whether temporary or not, is 
worth much more than what they 
get in return.

Accounting for your life: stocks
FRANK HU
Operations Manager
There are a lot of symbols, 
numbers, and terminology 
associated with the stock market. 
We frequently hear about 
how the Dow Jones Industrial 
Average is performing or where 
the NASDAQ composite is sitting 
or whether the S&P 500 is on the 
upswing. While these numbers 
mean everything to the floor 
traders buzzing like caffeinated 
bees over at the New York Stock 
Exchange (NYSE), they don’t 
do very much for the average 
person other than giving a vague 
idea of whether the economy is 
doing “well.”
The illusion of complexity is 
what drives people away, but 
to avoid investing in the stock 
market is a financial pitfall. 
With thousands upon thousands 
of stocks listed on the NYSE 
along with countless funds and 
options, it seems mind-boggling 
to try and understand and parse 
it all. And when it comes to 
investing, investing in things 
you don’t understand is a bad 
idea.
The trick is not to understand 
everything about the stock 
market, but to take a big-picture 
approach, reading and studying 
just enough about the market 
as pertains to your investment 
strategies. After all, not even 
professional investors can digest 
all the information that’s out 
there. Large investment firms 
usually have armies of analysts 
grinding out the numbers round 
the clock, and even then are only 
just scratching the surface.
So, what does it mean to 
look at the stock market from 
a big-picture perspective? A 
good place to start is to consider 
the different assets that are 
available, and how to invest in 
them. Rather than getting stuck 
on all the minutiae, we’ll go 
ahead and focus on three big 
asset classes: stocks, funds, and 
commodities.
To begin, let’s take a look at 
the kinds of funds that are out 
there. Broadly, funds fall into 
three categories: index funds, 
mutual funds, and exchange-
traded funds (ETFs). Index funds 
are designed to track a market 
segment (e.g. healthcare, large 
companies, tech) and serve as 
market indicators. However, 
they are not directly investable, 
meaning you can’t put your 
money into an index fund. For 
this reason, the focus is mostly 
on mutual funds and ETFs.
Mutual funds are a form 
of pooled investments, where 
you and many others give up 
your money to be managed 
by a professional. Usually, 
mutual funds are designed 
with a specific market sector in 
mind and invest in that sector 
accordingly. It’s not uncommon 
to see mutual funds that are 
designed to track index funds, so 
if you’re interested in following 
a specific index fund, it’s best to 
invest in an associated mutual 
fund. Mutual funds are priced 
at the end of the trading day, 
meaning that if you were to buy 
into a mutual fund during an 
ordinary trading day, the price 
you would pay is the price when 
the market closes at 4:00 p.m. 
EST.
Exchange-traded funds are 
different from mutual funds 
in that they can be thought of 
as a collection of securities. 
Essentially, the company that 
manages the ETF buys a bunch 
of one kind of investment, be 
it company stocks in a certain 
market sector or government 
bonds, and then parses it into 
lower-priced packages that it 
then offers to investors. For that 
reason, ETFs can be bought like 
stocks, since you can get shares 
of an ETF at a certain price, and 
they can be bought and sold 
during the regular trading day. 
ETFs are attractive since it gives 
investors exposure to a diverse 
collection, and often at a lower 
price than buying individual 
shares of stocks or individual 
investments.
Next, we have commodities, 
such as gold, silver, and crude 
oil. Believe it or not, you can 
buy and trade these resources 
on the market. Investing in 
commodities is not always a 
great way to accrue wealth in the 
short term since gold and silver 
prices fluctuate dramatically 
over short periods. However, 
investing in gold and silver can 
be a good way to protect your 
money during times of market 
volatility since gold is gold the 
world over. So, in the long term, 
commodities can guard against 
market downturns, although 
the buy-in price is steep. We’ll 
discuss more about commodities 
later.
Lastly, we have good old 
stocks. Everyone’s heard of 
stocks, but not everyone knows 
what it means to own a stock. To 
own some stock means you buy 
shares of the issuing company. 
So, if you bought say 50 shares 
of AT&T, you now technically 
own that fraction of AT&T, 
although that’s likely nothing 
compared to the literal millions 
of shares that investment firms 
have in these major companies. 
When you own a share, you are 
a shareholder of the company, 
and your fortunes from the 
stock depend on the company’s 
performance. Stocks can range 
from low-risk and low-reward 
to high-risk and high-reward, 
with the stocks of start-ups and 
new-born industries being the 
most volatile. Investing in stocks 
requires more diligence and 
attention to the data, as well as 
consistent monitoring of market 
conditions and trends.
With that brief overview, 
hopefully, the markets don’t 
seem so overbearing. Of course, 
there’s a lot of nuance within 
each of these three very broad 
categories, but the majority of 
investments available fall into at 
least one of these classifications. 
Moving forward, we will focus 
our attention on each of these 
groups, starting with funds, 
followed by commodities and 
then stocks.
Have you heard about the 
sleepy new “Sustainability 
Initiative” the provost is trying 
to sell us? Let me tell you: that’s 
a bucketful of promises with a 
hole in the bottom.
I can tell you all you need to 
know about the Sustainability 
Initiative. It includes no new 
staff hires. No monetary 
commitment. No actionable 
benchmarks. No structural 
change to the administrative 
organization. Instead, we get... 
what? More committees? More 
rhetoric?
Our house is on fire, and the 
provost sees fit to offer such limp 
leadership? I believe this shows 
that he doesn’t care about us, 
friends. At our current pace, the 
runaway temperature rise will 
reduce the planet to a desert. 
Before then, billions will suffer. 
If the provost really cared, he 
would do something. Something 
meaningful. But he cares only 
enough to say he does and not 
an ounce more.
Earlier this year, a faculty 
committee already provided a 
report recommending a real, 
concrete plan of action, with 
a plan to catch up to our peer 
universities and seize the lead 
in specific areas of sustainability 
research. The administration 
ignored it, and now we get a 
more pliant committee.
On Sept. 23, 2019, Provost 
James Garrett attended a photo-
op forum at a UN-affiliated 
event in New York City and 
gave vacuous commentary. 
(“We recognize that universities 
have invaluable roles to play in 
leading efforts to achieve...”) He 
did not mention that Carnegie 
Mellon — bizarrely — does not 
list any ecology courses taught by 
ecologists on SIO this academic 
semester, or that — alone among 
our peer universities — we do 
not have a high-level Office of 
Sustainability.
Not too far away that same 
day, Greta Thunberg addressed 
world leaders at the UN Climate 
Summit. She said: “If you 
choose to fail us, I say we will 
never forgive you.” If our school 
provost can’t commit to concrete 
action, what hope do we have 
of our world leaders? Provost 
Garrett, we are running out of 
time, and you are failing us. And 
who will forgive you?

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: CMU “SUSTAINABILITY 
INITIATIVE” IS THE COLLEGE’S EMPTY PROMISE
Madeline Kim/Forum Editor

Staffwriter
Capitol Hill has a problem. No, 
it is not Donald Trump. It is not 
extreme partisanship, either. Jobs 
and internships on Capitol Hill are 
highly sought after, yet not many 
people can actually afford these 
opportunities.
The issue is that, like most other 
major cities, the cost of living in 
Washington, D.C. is expensive. For 
those seeking internships and staff 
positions on the Hill, this can be a 
barrier. Because only certain types 
of people can afford to take up 
these positions, staff on the Hill is 
not as diverse as our country.
Internships on the Hill are 
highly competitive. Political 
science undergraduates all over 
the country dream about walking 
down the halls of the Capitol with 
their Senator or Representative, 
but this dream is stopped short 
when they see the price tag of 
short-term housing in D.C. and 
the word “unpaid” in their offer 
letter. Many people who would 
love to intern on the Hill are barred 
from doing so because of money, 
which disproportionately affects 
minorities.
Some student interns can 
receive outside funding from 
organizations like College to 
Congress, which will pay for all 
expenses incurred while interning 
in D.C. Programs similar to College 
to Congress help minorities 
and low-income individuals 
secure internships on the Hill. 
Nonetheless, as someone who did 
intern on the Hill, these programs 
have not cured all of the issues with 
the lack of diversity.
Unpaid internships are often 
advertised as “good experience,” 
but the reality is that when they 
are unpaid without a travel stipend 
for gas or the metro, interns are 
actually paying money to show up 
to work. This is corrupt, especially 
given that most interns on the Hill 
do not actually receive the policy 
experience they seek. Rather, they 
are trained to answer phones and 
give tours of the Capitol building. 
The administrative tasks that 
interns on the Hill perform do not 
classify as “good experience,” thus 
these unpaid internships can no 
longer be justi?ed with such an 
excuse.
This past summer, the 
Democratically-controlled House 
of Representatives appropriated 
some funds to pay their summer 
interns. Each of?ce in the House 
was given $20,000 annually to 
cover intern payment and the 
Senate of?ces are appropriated 
funds depending on the size of their 
state. Depending on the of?ce and 
their average amount of interns, 
interns are paid at least $1,000 per 
month. This pales in comparison to 
what interns in the private sector 
are paid, but it is a start and interns 
can use some of the money to pay 
off their D.C. expenses. This low 
intern salary will still be a barrier 
to some.
It is promising to see that 
Congress is trying to improve 
where they have failed and 
hopefully these new funds will 
create more opportunities for 
increasing the diversity of Hill 
interns. Although Congress is 
slowly moving on the matter of 
paying their interns, another 
problem remains: low staff salaries 
and the discrepancy of pay between 
senior staffers and everyone else.
Entry-level positions such 
as Staff Assistant or Scheduler 
have salaries of about $25,000 
annually, before taxes. How is this 
sustainable? Such a minimal salary 
limits many people from being able 
to accept positions on the Hill.
Other more experienced 
positions, like Chief of Staff, 
receive an average of $150,000 
per year, according to the 
Congressional Research Service. 
Obviously the Chief of Staff 
should be paid the most, but other 
positions like the Press Secretary, 
Communications Director, 
Caseworker, and Legislative 
Correspondent are paid much less. 
In fact, most Communications 
Directors make less than 
$70,000 per year and Legislative 
Correspondents make around 
$45,000 annually. Many positions 
on the Hill offer salaries of less 
than $55,000 per year, which is 
probably why staffers do not stay 
on the Hill for too long.
When Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez was elected to Congress, she 
vowed that each one of her staffers 
would receive a minimum salary of 
$52,000 per year. She does follow 
closely to her principle of paying 
her staffers a living wage, but in 
doing so she has made sacri?ces. 
She has a much smaller team than 
most members on the Hill. And 
in reality, $52,000 per year is not 
that much in the grand scheme of 
things, especially when you are 
paying D.C. rent.
It is no secret that government 
jobs are not highly paid, but when 
they are paid so little that staffers 
have to rely on their parents or a 
second job for extra funding, it 
is a crime. Staffers on the Hill do 
not work your typical nine-to-?ve 
job. Some staffers work on the 
weekends and late nights. Some 
never stop working at all. And they 
are not paid what they deserve. 
Congress came around in paying 
the interns, and it’s time for them 
to do the same for their staffers.

Washington D.C.’s unspoken problem in Capitol Hill
MADELINE KIM
Forum Editor
Just a year ago, Greta Thunberg 
was alone in the climate strike, 
striking outside the Swedish 
Parliament to highlight the 
Swedish government’s inaction on 
combatting climate change. This 
year, she is heralded as the leader 
of a movement that has inspired 
millions to join the strike. As 
much praise as she is receiving for 
“bringing momentum” to climate 
change activism, the criticism 
has been vicious. The two most 
prominent areas of attack have 
been her abilities and her age.
There’s no doubt that what 
Thunberg is doing is mentally 
tolling for anybody, regardless of 
their previous mental stability. 
However, the topic of mental health 
and ableism would not be in the 
conversation if a “normal” teenager 
were to lead the climate strike. 
In her 2018 TED talk, Thunberg 
shares that “she was diagnosed 
with Asperger’s, OCD, and selective 
mutism.” She calls her Asperger’s 
diagnosis her “superpower,” but 
that does not stop people from 
using her diagnoses as a way to 
“prove” she is mentally unstable or 
otherwise incompetent.
Just as recently as last Monday, 
Sept. 23, Michael Knowles from 
the Daily Wire was a host on Fox 
News and called Thunberg a 
“mentally ill Swedish child who 
is being exploited by her parents 
and the international left.” Since 
then, a spokesperson for Fox 
News told The Washington Post 
“the comment made by Michael 
Knowles who was a guest on The 
Story tonight was disgraceful — we 
apologize to Greta Thunberg and 
to our viewers.” However, Knowles 
refuses to apologize, defending 
himself by saying that “there is 
nothing shameful about living with 
mental disorders” but there is “with 
exploiting a child—particularly a 
child with mental disorders—to 
advance your political agenda.”
This leads to the other major 
point of criticism: her age. To some 
extent, I understand why people are 
uncomfortable with the thought of 
listening to a teenager. The power 
dichotomy feels reversed. Younger 
people generally look up to the 
expertise of older generations; 
Thunberg, in being the face of a 
global movement, ?ips those tables. 
I also think back to what I was 
like as a 16-year-old and I cringe. 
I’m sure most people will say the 
same about themselves. However, 
it’s important to not project our 
embarrassment from our teen 
years onto other teens. These 
people are raising understandable 
concerns about the trajectory of 
our planet. Their futures are the 
ones being affected by our current 
policies and decisions.
Also, I understand why 
someone’s youth may be associated 
with naïveté or susceptibility. 
Teenagers can be prone to social 
pressures like peer pressure or 
parental pressures. However, 
Thunberg made it clear that 
her activism was based on her 
own passion, not her parents’ 
ambitions. Last year, Thunberg’s 
parents “weren’t very fond of [a 
school strike],” telling her that “if I 
were to do this I would have to do 
it completely by myself and with no 
support from them.” Although they 
are much more supportive now 
and have changed their lifestyles 
to honor their daughter’s cause, 
Thunberg herself took the ?rst step.
It’s also important to note that 
Thunberg is not asking to be a leader 
of the climate change response, 
nor does she claim to know the 
exact policies that will save us 
from our climate crisis. Does she 
offer suggestions, such as limiting 
aviation and consuming a plant-
based diet? Sure. However, on a 
larger scale, she is trying to raise 
awareness, directing the authority 
towards climatologists and holding 
policymakers accountable.
There are far more young 
activists ?ghting for climate 
protection. Autumn Peltier, an 
indigenous Canadian, advocates 
for clean water. Alexandria 
Villaseñor founded Earth Uprising. 
Alongside Thunberg, she helped 
organize the Sept. 20 climate strike 
and ?led a complaint against ?ve 
of the world’s largest emitters of 
greenhouse gasses. This is the tip of 
the iceberg; there are more young 
activists ?ghting for a cleaner 
planet.
Frankly, I don’t know the “right” 
answers to how to combat climate 
change. I don’t know what policies 
will most effectively stop us from 
hitting the 2°C benchmark or how 
best to realistically protect the 
environment while allowing society 
to continue normally. Neither do 
the children who participated in 
the school climate strike. Even 
Thunberg and the other on-the-
rise youth activists don’t. All we 
simply ask is for dialogue that can 
help us ?nd these solutions and 
policy to follow.

“Alexa, dance”: Translating language into movement
CLYTZE SUN
Staffwriter
While we are getting 
accustomed to having a black 
cylindrical device responding to 
our questions and playing music 
for us, our sci-? dream remains 
unful?lled: when can we have 
our own home robots that move 
and ?nish tasks according to our 
verbal commands?
Associate professor at the 
Language Technologies Institute 
(LTI) Louis-Philippe Morency and 
Carngie Mellon Ph.D. student 
Chaitanya Ahuja have developed a 
computer model that can translate 
our daily language describing 
physical movements directly 
into minimalistic, computer-
generated animations. They 
named this neural architecture 
Joint Language-to-Pose or JL2P, 
with the goal of turning ?lm 
scripts into animations.
In a press release, Morency 
said, “Right now, we’re talking 
about animating virtual 
characters. Eventually, this link 
between language and gestures 
could be applied to robots; we 
might be able to simply tell a 
personal assistant robot what we 
want it to do.” With this goal in 
mind, researchers are teaching 
robots to understand human 
language and move accordingly.
Morency noted that the 
novelty of this research is the 
fact that, unlike the existing 
learning process, where robots 
learn movements and languages 
separately, JL2P is able to 
realize simultaneous learning 
of language and movements, 
allowing semantic associations to 
be projected onto movements.
With their model, robots would 
be able to associate words such as 
“run,” “jog,” and “walk” closely 
together, while discriminating 
their meanings. Instead of only 
responding to detailed commands 
exclusively in computer 
languages that disassemble 
every movement into single-
joint operations, robots would 
be able to comprehend high-
level commands in English and 
execute compacted movements. 
“Language [would be] their 
guide,” Morency concluded, on 
the way JL2P would empower 
robots’ learning capacity.
The Tartan also sat down with 
Ahuja, who presented JL2P last 
week in Quebec City, Canada, 
at the International Conference 
on 3D Vision. Ahuja further 
explained the mechanism behind 
JL2P’s central idea: the process of 
mapping sentences with motions. 
Since the same sentence can 
be represented with different 
animations — “a person walking” 
can be translated into animations 
walking at different speeds 
— their model breaks down 
sentences and treats words such 
as “walk” as concepts.
“Making those concepts 
requires joint embedding,” a 
process that vectorizes sentences 
into numbers, says Ahuja. 
Through joint embedding, they 
are able to translate semantic 
associations into conjunctions 
of concepts understood by 
computers. Ahuja provided an 
example of how conjunctions 
capture the complexity of 
language: “If ‘bank’ comes in 
conjunction with ‘money,’ it 
means it’s a ‘bank’ for money 
transactions, not a sea ‘bank.’”
In regards to their research’s 
future direction, Morency said 
in a press relase that their goal is 
moving from “narratives to pose” 
to “speech to pose.” Eventually, 
they hope their model will be 
able to animate “what people 
say.” This step requires not 
only an adaptation of verbal 
commands, but also an ability 
to animate people’s emotional 
expressions, that are pervasive 
in daily dialogues. To face their 
next challenge of animating 
emotions, Morency explained 
that introducing emotions can 
drastically increase the space of 
a commanded action, so getting 
a large amount of sample data 
would be crucial in advancing 
their model.
As Morency, Ahuja, and 
other researchers continue their 
journey of pushing the boundaries 
of human creation, they envision 
a future of close interactions 
between humans and robots.
Like dogs, cats bond with owners
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
Although cats are popularly 
well known for their independent 
and aloof nature, a recent study 
published in the journal Current 
Biology on Sept. 23 discovered 
that the responses of cats raised 
as pets to their caregivers is quite 
similar to those of human children 
and dogs.
The researchers concluded that 
the degree of attachment that cats 
have to their human caregivers 
and their socio-cognitive abilities 
have been vastly underestimated 
in years past. Children, dogs, and 
cats alike forge both secure and 
insecure bonds with their owners. 
Many researchers in the past 
thought that only canines had 
the ill-de?ned traits that allowed 
them to bond with animals from 
other species, but this new study 
demonstrates that these traits are 
clearly not canine-speci?c.
“Like dogs, cats display social 
?exibility in regards to their 
attachments with humans. The 
majority of cats are securely 
attached to their owner and use 
them as a source of security in a 
novel environment,” explained 
Kristyn R. Vitale Ph.D., a 
researcher at Oregon State 
University (OSU) who specializes 
in cat cognition and behavior, in 
an interview with Cell Press.
A time-tested method to study 
the attachment behavior of 
infants is to watch the reaction 
of an infant in a new area to 
reuniting with their caregiver, 
after the caregiver in question 
leaves for a brief period of time. 
Infants who have formed secure 
bonds decide to explore the area 
as leisurely as they had been 
before the departure of their 
caregiver, whereas those who 
have formed insecure bonds are 
either excessively clingy, or act 
in an avoidant manner. Although 
this method is typically used to 
test infants, tests of this nature 
have also been conducted with 
canines and primates. Therefore, 
it seemed like an obvious 
experiment to Dr. Vitale and her 
colleagues to conduct the same 
experiment with cats.
Vitale and her colleagues 
conducted the experiment by 
placing an adult cat or a kitten in 
a room completely new to them 
alongside their caregiver. They 
then instructed the caregiver to 
leave the room for two minutes. 
The caregiver was then told to 
return to the room and reunite 
with their cat for two minutes. 
Each cat’s attachment style was 
determined based on how they 
responded to reuniting with their 
caregiver.
The study showed that cats 
actually bond similarly to human 
infants. A full 65 percent of infants 
have formed a secure bond with 
their caregiver. Indeed, a full 65 
percent of cats and kittens have 
also formed a secure bond with 
their caregiver.
Vitale speculates that cats’ 
ability to form stable human 
attachments may have led to their 
popularity as pets.
“We’re currently looking at 
several aspects of cat attachment 
behavior, including whether 
socialization and fostering 
opportunities impact attachment 
security in shelter cats,” Vitale 
stated in Cell Press. Vitale and her 
colleagues are currently looking 
at the implications of their work 
on the thousands upon thousands 
of cats and kittens now stuck in 
animal shelters.
“The majority of cats are securely attached to 
their owner and use them as a source of security 
in a novel environment.”

The computer model created by Carnegie Mellon researchers converts text that describes movement, such as a ?lm script, into 
basic animations. Currently, the visuals are con?ned to outlines of stick ?gures, but the technology has potential to automate robots.

California introduces bill to give student athletes some protectionsMLB playoffs are starting this week
CYNTHIA XU
Junior Staffwriter
It’s no surprise that college 
athletics can be a huge source of 
revenue. In 2015 alone, Division 
I college sports programs 
managed to bring in a whopping 
$9.1 billion, the majority coming 
from ticket sales, television 
contracts, apparel deals, and 
merchandise sales. It did seem, 
however, a little curious that the 
NCAA, despite being a nonprofit 
organization, reported a revenue 
of over $1 billion.
It is without question that 
college athletes literally play 
an imperative part in this 
system. However, unlike their 
professional counterparts, 
student athletes are considered 
amateurs by the NCAA, and for 
this reason, are unpaid. While 
it is true that scholarships and 
such can be given out, the costs 
of college can remain a financial 
burden for economically 
disadvantaged student athletes.
NCAA rules for college athletes 
are considerably stringent, 
especially for those playing in 
Division I sports. Athletes are 
not allowed to receive any sort 
of benefit or payment relating 
to the use of their name, image, 
and likeness, and are prohibited 
from participating in advertising 
or promotion-related activities 
related in any way to their sport.
Although athletes themselves 
aren’t allowed to use the 
aforementioned aspects of 
themselves to participate in 
commercial promotions, NCAA 
Bylaw 12.5.1.1.1 states that the 
NCAA can use them to promote 
their own events and programs. 
This means that while the 
NCAA makes millions by using 
names and pictures of athletes 
to promote championships and 
such, the athletes themselves 
would face being deemed 
“ineligible” to play if they 
attempted to do the same.
Legislators in California are 
attempting to change this with 
Senate Bill No. 206, also called 
the “Fair Pay to Play Act.” Some 
of the goals of SB 206 include 
the prohibition of team contracts 
preventing student athletes 
from taking compensation for 
use of their name, image, and 
likeness from participation; 
and the prohibition of revoking 
their scholarships for the 
same reasons, or for obtaining 
authorized legal representation. 
In essence, the bill would not 
require colleges to pay student 
athletes, but grants student 
athletes the right to make money 
off of their names, images, and 
likenesses—rights enjoyed by 
virtually everyone else.
According to the NCAA Board 
of Governors, however, this 
bill is a mistake. In a letter sent 
to Governor Gavin Newsom, 
they state “We urge the state 
of California to reconsider 
this harmful and, we believe, 
unconstitutional bill.” According 
to them, California’s bill will only 
make them ineligible to play in 
the NCAA because they’d have 
an “unfair recruiting advantage.” 
They insist that “The NCAA 
continues to focus on the best 
interests of all student athletes 
nationwide. NCAA member 
schools already are working on 
changing rules for all student 
athletes to appropriately use 
their name, image, and likeness 
in accordance with our values.”
Perhaps instead of stalling 
and working to stifle these 
reformatory efforts with claims 
that similar efforts are being 
made, the NCAA should take 
the initiative and work with 
California, along with the rest of 
the states, to implement at least 
some of these rule changes. After 
all, actions speak louder than 
words.
SB 206 was passed in the 
California State Assembly 
unanimously on Sept. 9, a feat 
that was replicated with the 
California State Senate on Sept. 
11. It has now made its way to 
Governor Newsom’s desk. If 
signed, the measures listed on 
the bill would be in place by Jan. 
1, 2023. Other states, including 
Colorado, Maryland, New York, 
South Carolina, and Washington 
have been discussing similar 
legislation.
In a speech to a group of NCAA 
Division I athletic directors last 
Tuesday, President of the NCAA 
Mark Allen Emmert called SB 206 
an “existential threat” against 
the collegiate model. Ultimately, 
however, it may be time for the 
collegiate model to handle this 
“threat” through efficient change 
rather than continued resistance. 
The NCAA needs to start to work 
with states and their students.
interesting off the ?eld for fans of 
off-?eld drama.
In the other ALDS matchup, 
the Astros will face either the 
Oakland Athletics or the Tampa 
Bay Rays. Both the A’s and the 
Rays have had strong second 
halves of the season, and each 
team is working with a roster 
straight out of Moneyball. If 
you’re a Pirates fan looking for a 
team to cheer for, I recommend 
the Rays. After all, Chris Archer 
was a Ray once upon a time. As 
for the Astros, they’re coming off 
an amazing season from pitching 
ace and certi?ed old person, 
Justin Verlander. In his ?nal start 
of the season, Verlander hit 300 
strikeouts for the season and 3000 
for his career. If either of the Wild 
Card teams gives the Astros a run 
for their money, then the series 
will be worth watching.
On the other side of the MLB, 
my hometown Philadelphia 
Phillies disappointed. They 
?nished at 81–81, fourth place 
in the NL East, but they were a 
strong contender in the ?rst half 
of the season; maybe with a little 
more growth of their younger 
players, they could be a serious 
threat in October in the future.
Neither NLDS series is set as 
of mid-afternoon on Sunday. The 
Milwaukee Brewers are within 
one game of the Cardinals, so if 
the Cardinals lose to the Chicago 
Cubs and the Brewers beat the 
Colorado Rockies, there will be a 
game 163 to determine the winner 
of the NL Central. However, the 
Dodgers and the Atlanta Braves 
have won home-?eld advantage 
in the NLDS by winning their 
divisions with records better 
than either potential NL Central 
winner. The Washington 
Nationals have also locked down 
a place in the Wild Card game.
The Dodgers looked strong 
down the stretch, but it’s not 
saying much, as the last of their 
games against the NL West 
were a cakewalk. The Arizona 
Diamondbacks were the only 
team above .500, and they were 
only seven games over. It was a 
rough year for the NL West.
On the other coast, the Braves 
came out on top of a cutthroat 
division where every team, save 
the Miami Marlins, was above 
.500 for the season. Led by some 
very strong young players, like 
Ronald Acuna and Mike Soroka, 
the Braves have proven to be 
contenders in spite of their age. 
Veterans Dallas Kuechel and 
Mike Foltynewicz are good in the 
clubhouse, despite some of their 
performance issues.
In the Wild Card games, the 
Nationals are on a hot streak to 
end the season. Without Bryce 
Harper, the team has proven to be 
as good as they were with Harper, 
but the team has always struggled 
in the postseason, never making it 
out of the NLDS in recent years. 
The Cards and Brewers have 
stumbled into the postseason as 
major players on each team have 
gotten injured. Their ?ght to see 
who wins the NL Central is less 
about who is the better team, 
but who is able to hold onto their 
position.
As the ?nal day of the regular 
season wraps up, the playoffs 
are looming large. October is my 
favorite month, not just because 
of sweaters and pumpkin-?avored 
things, but because baseball 
playoffs are the most exciting 
thing to happen to me all year.
And maybe over the course 
of the winter, the Pirates Front 
Of?ce will care about their team’s 
performance. Maybe they’ll try 
to sign a player who can really 
help round out the team. Maybe 
when the Pirates return to spring 
training, the hope for a good 
season will turn out not to be false 
hope. I’m not holding my breath.

Perhaps instead of stalling...these reformatory efforts with 
claims that similar efforts are being made, the NCAA should 
take the initiative and work with California.

CMU football wins big continuing streak at St. Vincent
MARIKA YANG

The Carnegie Mellon University 
football team traveled to Latrobe, 
PA to take on the Saint Vincent 
College Bearcats on Saturday, 
coming away with a 49–14 victory. 
The Tartans remain undefeated on 
the season with a 4–0 record and 
3–0 record in Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference play.
The Tartans excelled on 
both sides of the ball. Junior 
quarterback JD Dayhuff ?nished 
with 218 passing yards, with one 
rushing touchdown and four 
through the air, all of which went 
to sophomore wide receiver Kris 
Hughes, who also had a career 
game with 5 catches for 120 yards. 
Senior running back Chris Haas 
led the Tartans with 58 yards on 
12 carries, while Dayhuff added 47 
yards on the ground.
The defense also played 
a standout game, forcing six 
turnovers (while the Tartans 
offense had none). After the 
Tartans ended the ?rst drive of 
the game with a punt, senior 
linebacker Quinn Gaughan forced 
a fumble on the Bearcat’s ?rst 
offensive play of the game. The 
fumble was recovered by senior 
safety Thomas Polutchko at the 
Bearcats 16-yard line. The Tartans 
offense took the ?eld, and on very 
next play, Dayhuff ran the ball into 
the endzone for the ?rst score of 
the game.
Two drives later, the defense 
made another play that led to a 
score. With the Bearcats backed 
up on their own 1-yard line, the 
defense forced an intentional 
grounding penalty in the endzone, 
leading to a safety and a 9–0 lead 
to the Tartans. Later in the ?rst 
quarter, Dayhuff drove the offense 
down the ?eld for a ?eld goal 
by sophomore kicker Brandon 
Nguyen to extend the lead to 12–0 
with less than a minute left in the 
quarter.
The Bearcats answered with 
their ?rst score at the start of the 
second quarter after converting 
a 3rd and 20 from mid?eld to the 
Carnegie Mellon 12-yard line and 
on the next play scoring with a 12-
yard pass by Bearcats quarterback 
Brady Walker. The Tartans offense 
struggled to move the ball for 
much of the second quarter, with 
three short drives, including two 
three-and-outs. The defense kept 
the Bearcats from putting together 
a scoring drive with strong play, 
including an interception by senior 
cornerback Anthony Kennon.
In the ?nal drive of the ?rst half, 
the Tartans offense found some 
momentum. Senior wide receiver 
Willie Ritcher returned a Bearcats 
punt 29 yards to the St. Vincent 35-
yard line for great ?eld position. 
After an 18-yard rush by Dayhuff 
and a 15-yard completion to junior 
wide receiver Alec Oshita, Dayhuff 
found Hughes in the endzone with 
four seconds left in the half.
The Tartans entered the second 
half with a 19–7 lead, and the 
Tartans continued where they 
left off. An interception by junior 
linebacker Mason Tolliver cut 
the Bearcats’ opening possession 
short. The offense capitalized 
on the next play with a Dayhuff-
to-Hughes 14-yard pass for a 
touchdown, bringing the score to 
26–7. Midway through the third 
quarter, the Bearcats drove down 
the ?eld 67 yards, capped by a 10-
yard touchdown by Walker.
The Tartans responded on the 
next drive. Bene?ting from a 39-
yard return by senior running back 
Sean Cooke, the Tartans rushed 
the ball four straight times before 
Dayhuff found Hughes again in the 
endzone, this time for 18 yards. A 
missed extra point kept the score 
at 32–14, but a ?eld goal late in 
the third quarter cushioned the 
Tartans’ lead going into the fourth 
quarter.
The defense shut out the 
Bearcats for the rest of the game, 
recovering two fumbles and an 
interception by Walker. Dayhuff 
led the offense to another score to 
Hughes, this time for 54 yards, the 
longest play of the game. First-year 
running back Ryan Shaw scored 
the ?nal touchdown on a 15-yard 
run, his ?rst career touchdown.
Though the Bearcats led the 
Tartans in time of possession and 
?nished with more rushing yards, 
the story of the game was the 
turnover margin (and the Tartans’ 
49 more passing yards). While 
the Tartans remain undefeated, 
the Bearcats move to 0–3 on the 
season and 0–2 in conference play.
Next week, the Tartans are on 
the road. They will battle Grove 
City College on Saturday, Oct. 5. 
Kickoff is set for 2 p.m. Grove City 
is 2–2 on the season.
Penalty shouts: Big Ben is literally dead
October is here: MLB playoffs begin, and there are no Pirates
MATTHEW BENUSA
Sports Editor
This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention. 
Two weeks ago, Ben 
Roethlisberger gratuitously 
and ceremoniously died on the 
football ?eld. There are reports 
of him going down and screaming 
“The horror! The horror!” as he 
stared off into Nothingness, also 
known as Roger Goodell’s soul.
I’m not a conspiracy theorist. 
In fact, I hate them. But are we just 
going to blindly trust all the news, 
video evidence, and a great Ben 
Roethlisberger look-alike when 
they say it’s just an elbow injury? 
Of course not. Wake up, sheeple. 
Ben Roethlisberger was sacri?ced 
by the Steelers to the sporting 
gods so the Penguins could win 
a Stanley Cup. They may have 
asked about the Pirates winning a 
World Series, but there’s as yet no 
power in the world strong enough 
to save them.
Here’s my evidence on why 
Roethlisberger must have been 
sacri?ced. On the day he was 
injured, there was a great storm. 
The winds were blowing and 
knocking over trees. It started 
to rain, but the drops rose from 
the ground. The sun darkened, 
and the day turned to night. 
Lighting struck the top of the BNY 
Mellon building, and from the 
basement of that building, Baal, 
Moloch, and Mammon awoke. 
Their spirits ascended and began 
to chant “Roethlisberger,” until 
the physical form of Big Ben 
was incinerated. His spiritual 
form turned into a glowing ball 
of energy, that ?ew into the 
outstretched hand of Moloch, 
now standing above the city of 
Pittsburgh.
Moloch shouted, 
“Pittsburghers! The protector of 
your city has been sacri?ced to the 
gods of the underworld, and your 
city will now be ours!” All three 
deities then disappeared, along 
with the glowing orb of energy. 
The storm stopped, and the sun 
came out. Famed Pittsburgh 
meteorologist, Jeff Verszyla, later 
called it an anomalous event. 
Shortly thereafter, everything 
went back to normal, or so they 
thought.
Without Roethlisberger at 
the helm, what are the Steelers 
supposed to do? Can Ben escape 
the clutches of evil demons and 
regain his physical form? Will 
the city of Pittsburgh survive 
without their protector? Find out 
next week on “Penalty Shouts: 
My conspiracy on what actually 
happened to Ben Roethlisberger 
because he de?nitely didn’t just 
hurt his elbow.” 
Wide out Kris Hughes, above, was responsible for receiving all of the Tartan’s touchdowns through the air, a total of four, with Hughes receiving ?ve passes.

In the next week, October is 
going to begin in earnest. The ?rst 
days of 60-degree highs, fall colors, 
sweaters, ghosts and ghouls, and 
playoff baseball are scheduled to 
begin this week. With the last day 
of baseball’s regular season on 
Sunday and the playoff teams set 
before game 162, there has been 
little controversy surrounding the 
playoffs so far, but once the ?rst 
pitch of the NL Wild Card game 
is thrown on Tuesday, it will only 
be three weeks until the World 
Series.
There are four teams with 100 
wins this season, and three are in 
the AL. The New York Yankees, 
Minnesota Twins, Houston Astros, 
and Los Angeles Dodgers all hit the 
100-win mark, while, hilariously, 
the Detroit Tigers couldn’t even 
hit 50 wins. The Pittsburgh Pirates 
ended the season with a record 
of 69–93, 22 games behind the 
NL Central-winning St. Louis 
Cardinals. Even though it was a 
disappointing end to the season 
for the Pirates, the baseball 
postseason is still exciting for fans 
of the game.
The Yankees are facing the 
Twins in the division series, and 
the Yankees have defeated the 
Twins in their last 10 playoff 
matchups. Additionally, the Twins 
haven’t won a playoff series since 
2002. But with a slow September, 
the Yankees are looking especially 
vulnerable moving into October. 
Over the course of the season, 
the only team capable of match-
ing the Yankees home run num-
bers was the Minnesota Twins, 
and after last week’s pronounce-
ment from the Twins president 
about how it’s “time to slay the 
dragon,” the series will at least be 
Even though the Indians didn’t make the playoffs this year, the end of the season is still a time for celebration.

Awfbeat
2019 has been a big year for AWFBEAT, the musical duo consisting 
of Uni Hunte and Grant Glazier. The two sophomores have released 
two tracks on Spotify, “Better than Me” and “Side Eyes,” and 
amassed over 20,000 monthly listeners on the platform. They also 
opened for bülow at the Activities Board-sponsored concert earlier 
this month.
Hunte is originally from Harlem while Glazier is originally from D.C. 
The two artists’ paths coalesced when they met at a pre-college 
program here at Carnegie Mellon. There were no long-term expecta-
tions then. They simply created a group to make music over the pro-
gram and expected to never see each other again afterward.
Fast forward to Orientation Week 2018. The two found out that they 
both lived in Stever and 
immediately rushed to 
see each other. Their 
complementary person-
alities and skills allowed 
them to take off with 
AWFBEAT from there. 
Hunte took over writing 
the lyrics, and Glazier 
filled in with the music 
production.
The name “AWFBEAT” 
may have been coined 
from a random word 
generator spitting out 
the words “off” and 
“beat,” but they have 
begun to attribute
deeper meaning to 
their moniker. The 
deliberate misspelling 
of AWFBEAT’s name 
encapsulates the two’s 
desire to do something 
different or even something conventionally considered “wrong.” By 
naming themselves something that most artists aim to avoid or be 
otherwise skeptical to dabble in, the pair demonstrates that they 
aren’t afraid to go outside the norm.
AWFBEAT doesn’t see their schooling and musical career as a zero-
sum game where they have to choose one or the other. Both believe 
that their Carnegie Mellon experience has greatly contributed to the 
development of their musical career. AWFBEAT’s first songs were
written using Carnegie Mellon’s piano in Stever.
“Not prioritizing school doesn’t seem like an option,” Hunte
succinctly summarizes.
“Better Than Me” was released in February. The song appears to be 
a standard love song about admiring someone from afar, but it
actually was inspired by “true infatuation with someone’s talent.” 
Being in an environment like Carnegie Mellon where one is constant-
ly surrounded with incredible talent and passion can be overwhelm-
ing, and that aura did not go unnoticed by the duo. Ultimately, this 
culminated “genuine awe in meeting someone” and seeing someone 
who makes one go “damn, she is ‘better than me.’”
“Side Eyes,” as stated by the duo, is about the story of a woman 
dealing with a man who is awful to her. Hunte draws from his 
upbringing “by strong women,” most notably his mother and his two 
sisters, saying that he “learned the most” from them. After coming 
to Carnegie Mellon, he and Glazier both met people with inspiring 
stories and personalities 
that all helped shape their 
further development into 
early adulthood.
Their contribution to the 
creative scene at Carnegie 
Mellon doesn’t stop at 
their music. Now, they 
reach out to other campus 
resources and collabora-
tions with other students. 
Most recently, the two 
collaborated with Charles 
Wang of White Porcelain 
on some merchandise, 
which was sold when they 
opened for bülow. As they 
expressed in the making 
of their track “Better Than 
Me,” the two recognize 
the outstanding amount of 
talent and passion on
campus and want to 
expand their network to 
both showcase their talent and other students’ talents.
What does the future look like for AWFBEAT? Just like any other 
college student, both Hunte and Glazier are taking it day-by-day.  
Attending Carnegie Mellon and being emerging artists are both
difficult as is individually. Juggling the two is demanding and keeps 
the two on their toes.
For now, though, they’re going to work on learning to “take care of 
ourselves” and allow their art and schoolwork to influence one
another. Their hearts are truly in the work, which is bound to take 
them far.

I saw Bastille for the first time in 2017 at Xfest presented by 105.9 
the X at Stage AE. As much as I had a blast during Bastille’s set at 
this festival (and met one of my closest friends through the concert), 
Bastille was the only group at the event that I actually wanted to see. 
So, I was thrilled to find out that they were returning to Stage AE for 
their first headlining appearance in Pittsburgh. It was great not endur-
ing five hours of random other groups’ music while waiting for one of 
my favorite bands to take the stage. Bastille stopped in Pittsburgh on 
Sunday, Sept. 22, and the experience seeing them perform was even 
better than the first time around.
The Doom Days Tour follows the release of the band’s newest album 
of the same name over the summer. Although their past albums — Bad 
Blood and Wild World — were absolutely brilliant, I loved the maturity 
and cohesiveness of both theme and sound throughout the songs in 
their newest record.
Joywave opened the night for Bastille. Part-way through the set, 
Joywave’s lead singer Daniel Armbruster admitted that someone on 
Twitter likened him to a “used car salesman,” and although I didn’t 
think he was the most charismatic and felt he was hard to understand 
over his bandmates’ loud instruments, it was still a decent perfor-
mance and they intrigued me enough to give them another shot after 
I got home. Listening to their 2015 album How Do You Feel Now?, 
there were a handful of songs I genuinely enjoyed (now that I could 
actually understand and appreciate their lyrics and overall sound). 
Notable songs include “Tongues,” “Traveling at the Speed of Light,” 
“Now,” and “Somebody New.” I look forward to taking on their 
2017 release Content next, and whatever music they release in the 
coming year before their own tour in early 2020.
I can definitely understand why Bastille paired up with the band for 
the tour. They both have such an interesting and distinct style, but they 
complement each other well. In fact, the song “Destruction” in par-
ticular reminds me a lot of songs from Bastille’s second album, Wild 
World. Interestingly, both bands had their start in 2010.  However, 
there is something definitely less “mainstream” about Joywave. 
Neither are “mainstream” per se, but I’d say that Joywave falls fur-
ther into the indie category than Bastille. For one, their utilitarian, 
safety vest-style shirts made quite the statement, and the photo of 
them in the same uniforms posing in front of a Pittsburgh ambulance 
that they posted on Instagram with the caption, “Thanks for calling 
911 Pittsburgh. What’s your emergency?” also exhibits a strange 
sense of humor that falls a bit short.
Bastille, on the other hand, continues to 
wow me with every show I’ve been to. 
The concert was divided into three acts 
— “Act 1: Still Avoiding Tomorrow,” 
“Act 2: Those Nights,” and “Act 3: The 
Morning Doesn’t Reach Us” — and 
each one was as incredible to witness 
as the one that came before it.
Lead Dan Smith often takes a brief 
interlude to discuss the work, and this 
time, he spoke of how music is a form 
of escapism, but his band also has a 
tendency to take their music in darker 
directions.
The struggle between seeking an 
escape and facing reality is preva-
lent in Bastille’s work, and this con-
flict is seen in “Act 1: Still Avoiding 
Tomorrow,” both in the title and con-
tent. The last three songs in this section 
particularly summed up these thoughts, 
with Doom Days’s “The Waves” and 
“Bad Decisions,” and Bad Blood’s 
“Flaws.” There is a clear contrast 
between the two ideas in “The Waves.” 
The third and fourth lines of the song 
encapsulate the escapism: “We never, 
never give up on the lost boy life / So here we are, escaping from the 
world outside,” but later, they reveal the dangers of people “get[ting] 
carried away” and “caught up in the waves” at parties. “Bad 
Decisions” simultaneously accepts and rejects reality, with an empha-
sis on “tak[ing] a bow for the bad decisions that we made” while also 
continuing to “make the same mistakes / ‘Till the morning breaks” as 
the world possibly falls apart around us.
B?stille: Doom D?ys Tour

---------------------------------------------------

“Act 2: Those Nights” took a perceptibly darker turn, with the lights 
dimming and Smith donning a hooded jacket, casting his face in 
shadow with the hood up for much of this segment and into the third. 
Opening the act, Smith was splayed out on a rotating couch, sing-
ing the honest lyrics of “Those Nights,” a song made more power-
ful by the slower tempo and minimal instrumentals. The group then 
transitioned into performing songs like 2012’s “Bad Blood” and 
the album’s eponymous track “Doom Days.” In an interview with 
Billboard, Smith spoke of the writing process for “Doom Days,” the 
last song he wrote for the album, and explained that “it allowed me 
to look back at the record and think, if it’s an album about escap-
ism, I needed to articulate what I needed escaping from. I wanted 
it to have no structure and flow like a rap, and to cram in as many 
references and points about life and anxieties in 2019 as I possibly 
could.”
Closing out the night, “Act 3: The Morning Doesn’t Reach Us” 
included “Another Place,” “A Million Pieces,” and the 2012 hit 
“Pompeii,” tied together by lyrics that expose human vulnerability 
and desperation for an escape from reality once more. In “Another 
Place,” Smith sings of flings, struggling between asking to “lie to me 
tonight and pretend ‘til the morning light / And imagine that you are 
mine” and what is really wanted, to not “make promises to me that 
you’re gonna break / We only ever wanted one thing from this.” In 
“A Million Pieces,” there is a difficulty in facing the horrors of real-
ity, trying to push away the bad thoughts and difficult conversations 
that need to be had: “Leave it ‘til the morning / I don’t wanna know 
/ Breaks my heart / Breaks my heart into / A million pieces.” With 
“Pompeii,” the world is crumbling as we know it, but we still cling to 
what once was: “But if you close your eyes / Does it almost feel like/ 
Nothing changed at all?”
Each aspect of the concert — whether it be the subtle 
costume changes, the videos playing on the screen 
behind the band, or the way that Smith interacts with 
his bandmates, the set, and the audience — adds a 
new layer that really elevates Bastille’s performance 
and shoots them to the top of the list of my favorite 
bands to see live. Smith continued to apologize for 
being sick and not being able to sing to his full poten-
tial, but I couldn’t even notice because he carries him-
self so well on stage. Whether he’s jumping off plat-
forms, wandering through the crowds during a song, 
turning the mic out toward the audience, or merely 
just crossing from one side of the stage to another, 
he feeds off the energy from the audience and knows 
how to liven up a show. Bastille put on another spec-
tacular performance at Stage AE last Sunday, and I 
hope they continue to include Pittsburgh on their tours 
because they’re a group you won’t want to miss.

Ad Astra is in much the same vein as the other 
recent, hyperreal, science fiction features about 
a near-future world with just a hint of dystopia: 
Gravity, Interstellar, and The Martian. Much like 
these others, our main character (Brad Pitt) travels 
to the far reaches of the galaxy to find out just 
how much he loves the Earth. As a whole, the 
movie is a generally successful work, that hits the 
right notes about increasingly aloof psychological 
states, extraterrestrial life, and the limits of 
science; additionally, it’s only slightly preachy and 
referential to Kubrick and Tarkovsky.
All of the parts of the movie were basically good.
Max Richter’s score is adequate. The neoclassical 
composition is probably the only thing that would 
have worked well for the movie. The editing is in 
the classic style of Hollywood: nothing too heavy-
handed or obtuse. Cinematographically, there 
are a few interesting choices, like filming a dope 
moon car chase scene from miles above, but 
generally, it feels like a pastiche of all the great 
cinematic moments of Gravity and The Martian, 
with a touch of Kubrick. There is little in the set 
or costume design to distinguish itself from other 
science fiction movies. However, Pitt’s sneaker 
game is the essential drip. Pitt’s performance may 
have been the standout aspect of the movie, but 
it’s often minimized by a voice-over that explains 
his interior narrative.
As for the plot of the movie, it’s the classic 
family melodrama dropped into space. It’s well-
constructed, hits all the beats, and the implications 
of the relationship between Pitt’s Roy McBride 
and Tommy Lee Jones’s Clifford McBride are more 
effective emotional confrontations than those 
presented in Once Upon a Time in Hollywood. 
Both feature cult-like leaders or an adjacent 
representation, and both feature main characters 
played by Pitt, who is almost tempted into the 
world of the cult by a person his character loves 
(or is sexually attracted to). In the end, Pitt 
escapes by metaphorically murdering the part of 
his character that is attached to the cult, and he 
returns to the normal world.
Ultimately, I think this movie is very close to being 
the best of the recent science fiction production, 
even one of the best movies of the year. But there 
are just too many moments that diminish the 
really successful things the film does. If James 
Gray went back to the editing room, took out half 
an hour of Pitt staring at nothing, removed a lot of 
the voice over, and cut the preachy moments that 
don’t fit into the standard science fiction schmaltz, 
then Gray would have a tighter movie — one 
that isn’t just forcibly emotional and purposefully 
intelligent, but a movie that’s intelligent by way of 
emotional relations.

It’s a Monday night. A crowd of people 
funnels into the Carnegie Library Music Hall, 
skirting around tables brimming with brightly 
colored books. They inch their way to their 
designated seats, tickets gripped in their 
fists. The air is hot; visitors fan themselves 
with their programs and push sleeves up to 
elbows. The lights go down. A few presenters 
prepare the crowd with speeches and thanks 
and words of excitement. Then Sigrid Nunez 
walks onto the stage, and applause erupts. 
Nunez is an author of seven novels, including 
a memoir of Susan Sontag. Although she’s 
been writing for decades, Nunez exploded 
into the public consciousness in February 
2018 after she published her latest novel, 
The Friend. It won the 2018 National Book 
Award and became an instant New York 
Times bestseller. Nunez became a literary 
sensation practically overnight.
 
The Friend is a tale of love, friendship, grief, 
writing, healing — and most of all, a dog. 
The story follows a woman who loses a friend 
and mentor to suicide, and later inherits his 
old Great Dane. The Great Dane, dubbed 
Apollo, is struggling with the inexplicable 
loss as much as the narrator. Together, they 
navigate their grief and foggy future, forming 
a bond that’s strange and poignant in equal 
measures.  
In her talk, Nunez discusses both her novel 
and her experience writing over the years. 
As a child, she ended all of her stories with 
“and then I woke up.” Since she was told not 
to lie or make things up, she felt she had to 
qualify that her stories were a dream, unreal, 
made up. As she grew older, however, she 
discovered that’s the beauty of fiction. You 
can make everything up, it can all be lies, 
and it can still ring true with millions of 
people. 
As an adult, she makes a lot of things up. 
She speaks for people that have never 
existed. Although she’s traveled to many 
places in Europe, she sends her protagonists 
to places she’s never been, and welcomes 
the research that comes along with it. 
She’s written about events both real and 
fake, and the latter always hits her harder. 
Our imagination is more powerful than 
observation, she says.
The audience nods. Most of us have read 
her touching novel. We know how powerful 
imagination can be. 
Since her novel was published, Nunez has 
received an influx of letters. They include 
people who have lost someone to suicide. 
People who have tried to commit suicide 
themselves. Writers who relate to the 
narrator’s cynical insights into the writing 
world. And lots and lots of pet owners, who 
appreciate a novel centered around the bond 
between a woman and her dog, the most 
important being in her life. 
Since Nunez became a bestseller, she says 
she’s been busier. She has readings to 
attend, talks to give, and students to teach. 
However, her work hasn’t changed. She still 
has more writing to do. Once, when facing a 
block, she put a post-it note on her computer 
that declared the writing is almost over.
“But then,” she says, a wry smile dancing on 
her face. “I woke up.” 
The night ends. Visitors shuffle down 
stairs and through halls, stuffing crumpled 
programs into purses and backpacks. Some 
flee into the warm night air. Some pick up 
copies of The Friend from the lobby. Some 
huddle in groups of twos and threes, chatting 
and laughing. But although we go our 
separate ways, we are all connected by a 
hum of energy in the air, a shared experience 
of hearing Nunez’s talk, her words just as 
impactful in person as they were on the 
pages of her novel.

I hope it is still in tradition to feel 
the rough edges of a piece of paper, 
to practice handwriting endlessly 
to please your teachers, and not 
everything has become the “Okay, 
Google” speech to text translation that 
doesn’t understand the way my heavy 
accent speaks English.
I hope it is still in tradition to have 
huge bookshelves and watch them 
while you sip coffee and watch the 
pages turn yellow, as you watch 
every dog-eared page culminate to 
make it seem like it belongs in this 
imperfection.
I hope it is still in tradition to drink 
pure coffee and not like those liquid 
food cups in WALL-E. Oh boy, I sure do 
hope you are not in a spaceship right 
now. I also hope you have watched 
WALL-E and the amazing cinematic 
reveal of films like The Breakfast Club 
and Star Wars. More importantly, I just 
hope things are better in some cases, 
and in most, stay the way they are.
It might seem confusing, but I live in a 
time that is so conflicted, so energetic 
yet disastrous, that I feel like I am in 
the right and wrong generation all 
at the same time. I watch amazed as

Hello,

---------------------------------------------------

LGBTQIA rights become better every 
day, but also shed tears over how 
women get raped every hour in my 
home country. How the world economy 
is booming, and yet we are creating 
literal walls for ourselves. We are 
creating so many barriers that we are 
going to choke on them. But with every 
good deed, flowers sprout through 
these walls, and I just hope that these 
walls have broken. Or at least, that 
you have learned to climb over them.
It might seem overwhelming how 
different our worlds might be, but 
that’s okay. I couldn’t even believe my 
parents had never seen each other 
before the day of their marriage. 
And these are the things I hope have 
changed. I do hope that you are my 
long lost family, or that this letter 
was passed down by generations. I 
hope my books are still somewhere 
on shelves... if I even wrote them. It 
might seem confusing, but with every 
word I write to you, my mood becomes 
infinitely better. I do hope that with 
every word I write, beautiful sprouts 
of truth will emerge. But I know, 
somewhere deep in my heart, that 
all that will grow on this paper is the 
finest layer of dust, and as you blow 
that very dust off to read this paper, 
that truth will dance in the sunbeams.
I hope above all that humanity is 
as marvelous as it always was. We 
make mistakes, and they may seem 
huge right now, but bear through it. 
Write another letter to be found in a 
hundred years, and who knows? Might 
these words come true? Might you in 
a hundred years actually still be me? 
Oh, that would be awesome!
Remember this, I am 17 and young 
and probably stupider than ever. 
I’ll spot this letter while packing for 
university, and I will sit and rewrite it. 
So if you read this one in a hundred 
years, know that this the mind of 
someone who believed in change, in 
all things better, in humanity being the 
best of hope.
If you are fed up with the world, never 
be. You are part of the most innovative 
race that has ever existed. You don’t 
need to be at the front of everything. 
You don’t need to be at the top of the 
pedestal to be safe. I hope you get 
some satisfaction and some motivation 
knowing how much our worlds have 
changed.
My own mindset might change as I 
watch the world progress. I’ll want you 
to remember new things, closer to my 
heart: my first dog, my first boyfriend, 
my first confession, the fact that my 
country is still a beautiful assault 
on the senses... but what will never 
change is my hope in humanity and 
how much better it can be.
So amongst the threat of an 
impending WWIII, men and their 
mad hues, a prime minister using 
a foundation’s diverse skin color 
range to match my skin color (I am 
so flattered he even considered us!), 
where there is still a stigma over 
anything you want to be, as a woman, 
as a human, I hope your world is 
better.
I hope humanity learns its mistakes 
from now. And all I want is for you to 
remember these mistakes. Remember, 
for entropy might be both here and 
there where you are right now; it is 
part of the code of humanity. This 
is not a letter to you, but to all thy 
entropy: I hope you learned and 
remembered all the things you made 
us do. And I hope you became a little 
better. And that is all.
With all the hope that this is not the 
world of Fahrenheit 451,
This is the past,
Who still dreams of traveling the 
stars,
Breaking our walls,
Signing out.

This past Friday, three indie alt-pop acts — 
Lostboycrow, joan, and flor — came together 
at The Club at Stage AE. Despite the three 
performances being within the same genre, 
each had an individual take. Lostboycrow 
was whimsical and full of narrative, joan was 
danceable and upbeat, and flor was more 
conventional modern alt-pop.
The Club is a smaller section of Stage AE with a 
bar, a tight crowd space, and a small stage. This 
was my first time seeing a performance in this 
part of the venue, but I’m certain it won’t be the 
last. The crowd energy felt more concentrated, 
and both the smaller space and audience size 
made the concert feel more intimate.
Lostboycrow (Chris Danks) was first on the 
set. He performed a handful of songs from his 
latest release, Santa Fe, as well as a couple of 
older releases like “Devil’s in the Backseat” and 
“Adolescent.” His performance embodied his stage 
name, which is inspired by the Crow Nation’s tale 
of the lost boy. The nation’s ancestors’ philosophy 
“believed the greatest accomplishment one could 
FLOR
achieve was to dream. Seek a vision for your life 
that would help those around you.” This inspires 
how he presents his art. His ethereal sound and 
poetic lyrics make it sound more like he’s telling 
a story rather than simply producing music.
Out of the three performances, Lostboycrow’s 
surprised me the most. In the studio, his voice 
sounds more “chill,” almost more subdued. 
However, on stage, his voice was much more 
powerful and captivating. It felt like he was 
crooning, yet his energy and voice overpowered 
the venue. His music was the one I was most 
acquainted with, yet his performance was the 
one that I was the most mystified with.
Next up was the duo, joan (Alan Thomas and 
Steven Rutherford). The ‘80s inspired synth-
pop encapsulates the best part of the ‘80s: 
catchy choruses, poppy synth beats galore. Even 
their name ties with the ‘80s theme. Neither is

named Joan; the two simply picked 
the name because the name was 
common in the ‘80s. If I had to 
explain the band, I would say that 
it’s most reminiscent of The 1975. 
Their act made me almost want to 
bring back leg warmers. Almost.
Flor ended the show with a bang. 
The band sonically sounded just like 
they did in their recordings, but the 
live performance gave their songs 
a kick that no recording could pick 
up. They bounced back and forth 
from their two albums, come out. 
you’re hiding and ley lines, the 
latter which just dropped earlier this 
month. Their part of the show was 
definitely the flashiest of them all 
in more ways than one. The band 
incorporated lights that seemed to 
flash per drum beat which was fun 
at first but became overwhelming 
later in the show. I didn’t mind too 
much, given that the synergy of the 
band and crowd was so intense that 
it almost matched up.
After the show, all three groups 
were available for a quick meet-
and-greet, signing tickets and taking 
photos with the concert attendees. 
Ones to Watch, a platform for 
emerging artists, put their stamp of 
approval on flor when they decided 
to present the band, and I’m 
ecstatic to see what comes next for 
them and their opening acts. Stay 
tuned for an upcoming interview 
with flor!11

This is CMU.
“
“During freshman year, messing around with 
friends in our dorm or getting food together 
— just simple things — were some of my 
favorite moments at CMU. Once you become 
an upperclassman, you either move off campus, 
or you move into an upperclassman dorm, and 
people are less outgoing and talkative. So to 
hang out with people, you really have to make a 
lot more of an effort, whereas [in] freshman year, 
you just leave your room and you see people 
you know, you go into one of the common areas 
of your dorm and you see people you know 
— there’s just people around to talk to. I miss that availability of 
friends and people you know hanging out all around. Try to find 
your main group of friends — people you know you’re going to be 
able to stick with in your later years of university. But also branch 
out and try to get involved in activities, make friends in different 
majors, living in different dorms. Even if you’re a shy person, just 
do your best to be outgoing, meet new people, and really enjoy 
your college experience. Because you only get it once in your life.”
Inspired by the famous Humans of New York project, 
this recurring column focuses on interviewing students 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus and learning about their 
lives and university experience.

Tyler,
the Creator
written by Nathaniel Richmond | Junior Staffwriter
layout by Alexandra Yu| Pillbox Editor
Tyler, the Creator’s show at Stage AE was an electric performance of his new album, IGOR. He captured the crowd immediately with the blaring 
intro to his album, and he bounced around his catalog of songs to give a raw and exciting show.
The show began with songs from IGOR. The autotune and multi-tracking that are signatures of his album, which might have made the songs 
difficult to perform live, were replaced with Tyler performing the main parts of his songs, and he rose to the challenge. He sang, yelled, and 
screamed to match his songs’ effects. This developed into a unique performance apart from the album and gave a more up-close view of the 
feelings of romantic jealousy and hopelessness he describes in his songs. It resulted in a performance that gave fans of the album what they 
wanted while expanding on IGOR.
Among the songs Tyler, the Creator performed were also some of his signature songs from past albums like Flower Boy. He sang more romantic 
songs like “See You Again” and “She” that felt natural alongside Tyler’s romantic struggles in IGOR. Of course, he also sang crowd-pleasers like 
“Who Dat Boy” to get the crowd hyped with his bark-rapping and crude lyrics.
The best part of the show was Tyler, the Creator playing the part of Igor, the character in his album. He wore the suit and blonde wig that have 
become symbols of the album, and he danced wildly during interludes to keep moving throughout the show. He head-bopped, ran in place, 
and marched to the beat of his songs. The variety of personas he adopted gave fans many angles to enjoy the show from. The piano rendition 
of “EARFQUAKE” and other slower songs complemented the energetic performances he is more known for, creating a deeper story and sound 
within the short time of the concert.
Tyler, the Creator’s performance built up to a captivating show. Tyler, the Creator has been known for having violent and offensive lyrics, and 
his crowds have a reputation for being chaotic as well. After Flower Boy and IGOR, though, Tyler seems to have evolved from his angry,
controversial self into a somewhat more accessible artist. There are still explicit lyrics and violent ideas, but the complex feelings and sound 
behind them make Tyler, the Creator’s IGOR an exciting concert.

Welcome to Maddy's 
Monthly Meme 
Madness, where we 
take a look at the Top 
5 most-liked memes 
on the Facebook 
group, Carnegie 
Mellon Memes for 
Spicy Teens, posted in 
the past month.
MADDY'S MONTHLYMEME MADNESS
The Carnegie Mellon experience isn’t 
complete until we pit ourselves against 
each other and compete over which 
college suffers the most. Although 
tongue-in-cheek humor about our 
poor work/life balance and our 
faltering mental health can be funny in 
moderation, please remember to take 
care of yourselves.

“SLEEP @ CMU”
Malique Bennett
Alexander is back at it again with the dank 
high-effort memes. The meme somehow 
tastefully incorporates Comic Sans MS and 
captures the evanescence of different parts of 
Carnegie Mellon culture, such as the beep-
boop (never forget).

“SUBRA SKEDADDLE”
Alexander ChenSeptember

---------------------------------------------------

Everything about this meme is perfect. 
Firstly, the wholesome supportive message 
goes out to all of our students; all 
disciplines and colleges are valid and we 
are all suffering in this institution together 
(but should encourage each other to 
minimize the suffering!). Also, the caption 
on the original Facebook post, “Raymond 
John Wean is opposed to stress culture,” is 
a nod to the striking semblance between 
Raymond John Wean’s plaque in Wean 
Hall and Danny Devito.

“WEAN OFF OF 
STRESS CULTURE”
Cali Colliver
This is an absolute 
genius master strategy; 
why did I not think 
of it? The cartoon’s 
stylish pose also adds 
fabulous flair. However, 
what is up with the 
ungodly amount of 
white space on the 
top and bottom of 
the meme? I’ve said 
it before and will say 
it again: crop your 
memes.

“TOC HACK”
Tishya Girdhar?
Name something more Carnegie 
Mellon-esque than Andrew 
Carnegie himself and computer 
science. The summoned demon 
of Carnegie will continue to haunt 
my dreams and haunt me to keep 
my heart in the work.
