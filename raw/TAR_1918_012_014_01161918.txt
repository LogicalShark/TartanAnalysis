TECH BAND WILL PLAY 
FOR MILITARY DRILL
At the weekly rehearsal last Wed 
nesday of the C. I. T. Band, Major 
Lyle gave a short talk on the import- 
ince of such an institution in the 
irmy. Nothing enlivens the men nor 
brightens their spirits so much, he 
said, as the band. Particularly when, 
returning from an all day battle, they 
are met by the band playing ’‘Amer­
ica” or "The Star Spangled Banner.” 
As soon as arrangements can be made 
Director Sullivan will have his “toot- 
ers” out making two hours drill seem 
like two minutes.

THE KNABE-AMPICO
REPRODUCING PIANO
The most wonderful musical instrument 
in the world
The thrill of the artist’s personality and magnetism is transfer­
red from the concert hall to the home, at the touch of a tiny lever!
All the music in the world is open to you. With the Ampico 
every shade of expression, beauty of tone color—the very essence of 
the genius of Godowsky, Hofmann, Bauer, Ornstein and a host of 
others—is reproduced at will, with an art so perfect that all thought 
that it is a reproduction is lost.

On Sunday afternoon, Jan. 13, Miss 
Helene Pope and Miss Emily Sibley 
gave a tea for the Household Econom­
ics girls in their home at 227 Dith- 
ridge street.
On Friday evening, Jan. 11, the 
Tech Bible class of the First Baptist 
Churck had a party in the M. M. C. S. 
Recreation Hall. On account of the 
poor weather, not everyone turned 
out, hut those who did come had a 
very fine time. Mr. and Mrs. Conrad 
chaperoned.
Are you wondering what that little 
button of yellow and white that you 
see M. M. girls wearing, means? It 
means that those girls have joined the 
S. O. S. Club, and are sacrificing some 
definite thing to keep our hoys at tlir 
front happy and healthy. To join tlir 
club and | receive a button, you must 
only sign a pledge that you will give 
up some certain convenience or lux 
ury, and give that money to the S. O 
S. fund.
CRITICAL REVIEW OF
SCHOOL FOR SCANDAL
Miss Holmes, on her Christmas va 
cation, attended a convention at th< 
La Salle Extension University. Thii 
convention is part of a national move 
ment for greater efficiency in lette* 
writing. Most of the delegates werr 
University Professors teaching Bus! 
ness Correspondence and businesp 
men supervisors of correspondence.
The plan of the La Salle Extension 
University is to offer correspondence 
courses to be installed in the business 
of large corporations for use by their 
employes who give dictation. If this 
plan proves successful, we will see 
the beginning of the end of the old- 
fashioned, stilted business letter.

A questionnaire from the Federal 
Bureau of Education was sent out last 
week to all the schools in the coun­
try equipped to give technical and in­
dustrial instruction. The government 
called for three sets of estimates cov­
ering a list of specified vocations, 
starting with accountants and ending 
with wireless operators, as follows: 
(1) How many persons could be in­
structed Avith present staff, and in ad­
dition to the regular student load; (2) 
how many could be taken care of with 
present, staff, under a temporary sus­
pension of part of the regular load; 
(3) what would the utmost capacity 
be if the government commandeered 
the entire resources of the institution, 
operated war courses only, and fur­
nished additional instructors.

A delegation of faculty and students 
attended the funeral services of Mr. 
Zeller, which were held at his home 
yesterday afternoon. The burial took 
place at Bordentown, N. J., and at the 
same hour (2:30 Tuesday afternoon) 
a service of appreciation was held in 
the theatre of the school of applied 
design, at which Director Hamer- 
schlag, Director Beatty and Mr. Horn- 
bostel said a few words. There was 
an organ number by Mr. O’Brien. A

relation to. and reaction upon the en­
tire cast.
The stage settings, by Mr. J. Wood­
man Thompson, added much to the 
success of the play, the setting for 
act Y, scene I, being especially ef­
fective.
The costumes, one of the most inter­
esting features of the production, wer 
designed and executed by Miss Kath­
erine Jones and Miss Sara Bennett.
The prologue to the play was given 
by Miss Dorothy llubenstein with a 
certain vivacity and charm, which 
tended to interest the audience in 
what was to follow.
Mr. Howard Smith’s “Sir. Peter 
Teazle” was one of the very good 
things he has done. He was a very aim- 
able “Sir Peter” with considerable 
good humor betraying itself through­
out. One of his best moments was in 
the denouncement, where Lady Teazle 
is . discovered—his silent attitude of 
outraged dignity and honor was most 
convincing. His "makeup” was one 
of the best in the cast.
Mr. Wm. Mulligan’s “Sir Oliver Sur­
face” was one of the most finished bits 
of acting in the play—interesting from 
first to last. There can no longer he 
any question in regard to Mr. Mulli­
gan’s versatility—he has run the 
gamut from farce to high tragedy and 
scored everything. “Uncle Nol” may 
be added to the lengthening list of his 
achievements.
Mr. Theodore Yiehman’s “Sir Ben­
jamin Backbite” was a more genial 
gentleman than his cognomen would 
lead one to expect. His makeup was 
interesting; his manner quaintly amus­
ing; (one suspected him of getting 
some fun out of it himself.) 1-Ie caught 
the fancy of his audience on his en­
trance and held it. until his final exit.
Mr. Norwood Engle as “Joseph Sur­
face” was at his best in the intimate 
scene with Lady Teazle where he tries 
to persuade her to revenge hersolf up­
on Sir Peter and his ill humors.
Mr. Hubbard Kirkpatrick made an 
ideal “Charles Surface” and had the 
sympathy of his audience from the 
first. “Uncle Nol” was not the only 
victim of his charm. His work, which 
has been very good in former plays, 
shows marked improvement.
Mr. James Church was double cast 
—doing "Rowley” and “Sir Harry 
Bumper.” He carried both roles suc­
cessfully; his vocal ability added much 
to the success of his “Sir Harry.” Just 
a shade more of vivacity would have 
added much to the conviviality of this 
very interesting scene. All Mr. Church 
does suffers from his too serious at­
titude—it makes his work heavy.
Mr. Colin Clements, “Crabtree” was 
a very amusing and interesting char­
acterization—rather a pleasanter poi­
son than one expected t.o meet on this 
occasion.
Mr. Georgo Trabert’s affable 
“Moses”—the money lender—created 
a good deal of merriment. He made 
the most ol’ a small oporl,unity.
Mr. David Gaither’s “Careless” was 
good to look at. hut too “careless” in 
speech—his inebriation was of a too 
modern type to fit the situation—one 
suspected the beverage to have been 
something loss elegant than chain 
pagne, that made his feet so unman 
ageable.
Mr. Alexander Buchanan as “Snake" 
lacked the subtlety and sinuosity the 
name implies. II. is not a grateful part 
at best and he was unforlunatoly cast 
in this role. Mr. Bishop Dickenson 
fitted the part more nearly, but did not 
make the most of his opportunity.
The female roles were all double 
cast which is usually unsatisfactory to 
both sides of the curtain. Of course 
“Lady Teazle” claims first attention; 
the two interpretations of this char­
acter were very individual—both 
charming to the eye. Miss Eula Guy 
gave the more conventional interpre­
tation, while Miss Hazel Beck's ver­
sion was a Lady Teazle “au natural,” 
a creature quite likely to beguile the 
crusty Sir Peter. Which one pleased 
the most depended on one’s predilec­
tion for “Lady Teazles.” This par­
allel, of the artificial with the natural, 
holds with the other characters as 
well.
Violante Bollinger’s “Mrs. Candour,” 
was the most finished piece of acting 
in the cast. She caught the spirit of 
it and shbmerged her own personality 
most successfully. She was especially 
well cast on this occasion, her keen 
appreciation of artistic values being 
apparent through all her work.
Miss Beatrice Heinrich's interpreta­
tion of the same role was that of a vi­
vacious pouting, girlish creature quite 
charming in her own way—which does- 
not seem to have been the way of Mrs 
Candour, the mature society woman of 
a most artificial period of history.
Miss Browen Chubb presented quite 
a serious "Lady Sneerweil”—one fell 
from the first that the lady “had a 
past.”—and was not rendered amiable 
by the experience. She was well' cast 
—having the type of features one 
finds in portraits of this period and 
to which the styles of the period give 
added charm. Her voice is admirable 
for this character and her diction ex­
cellent. Indeed, the entire perform­
ance gave evidence of careful work in 
l.lils particular and reflected credit on 
the entire cast.
Miss Esther Gromme’s “Lady Sneer- 
well” was concieved in a lighter vein— 
neither the past nor the future were 
really serious considerations with this 
lady, who laughed oftener and with 
more spirit of fun than her name war­
ranted.
Miss Mary Ricards was particularly 
well cast in the role of “Maria” (ward 
of Sir Peter) making this character 
at once sympathetic and appealing.
Miss Helen Donnelly’s interpretation 
of this role was more sophisticated. 
The "makeup” in both instances was 
charming.
Mr. Lawrence Paquin as "Trip” 
made, the most of a small bit. Miss 
Minnette Buddecke, Miss Jane Mor 
row and Miss Carolyn Mering (maids), 
and J. Montgomery Wolcott and I-I. F. 
MeClenahan (butlers), did good work.
MILITARY DRILL AT
TECH WELL UNDER WAY
(Continued From Page One.) 
of the week every man will be thor­
oughly acquainted with these move­
ments so that more difficult and ad­
vanced things may be started.
The few drills that have been held 
show that the men who took the 
course in drill last year are getting 
along much better than those who did 
not, particularly the plebes. Although 
it was not as thorough, it can be notic­
ed in the drill.
The Major and his assistants have 
impressed the men that the best drill 
may be had, if each individual tries 
to do, and feels that he can do, a lit­
tle bit bettor than the man next to 
him. This ‘also applies to companies 
as well as individuals and it might 
be said, to regiments as well as com­
panies. They also stated that competi­
tion and a feeling of superiority al­
ways brings the best of results.
Now that the band will soon be out 
to play for the drill, Tech should 
have a promising looking army very 
soon.

PITT TEAM NEXT FRIDAY
(Continued From Pago Ono.)
The Plebes will play the preliminary 
game next Friday evening. Kelley, a 
Turtle Creek High, is playing a good 
game for the Pitt Freshmon, having 
made twelve baskets in three games. 
He Is also an accurate foul shot. Fif­
teen of his twenty-four attempts have 
been successful. Our plebe combina­
tion is exceptionally fast, however, so 
it is not expected that they will find 
a difficult task.
THE CALL
The crisis has arrived at last,
’Tis now no time for idle dreaming. 
Now, when a nobler era. dawns,
A soldier’s life is more beseeming. 
With policies that hut betray,
Let politicians trim and trifle,
Be yours, the braver, manlier way 
Of learning how to use a rifle.
Oh, if at last we fall so low,
For all the sorrows we have suffered. 
As to relinquish every right,
For this base compromise that offer­
ed.
Then speak of Liberty no more,
Lest all our dead unknown and 
nameless,
Should rise from out there every grave 
To curse a race that sank so shame­
less.
Away, away, leave loyalty,
To rot within its fetid furrow.
Gird up your loins for nobler things, 
And watch for the warlike morrow. 
Grasp in your hands the bayonet hilt, 
Liberty’s only true defender,
And swear the very sun shall will:, 
Before It will witness our surrender.
For all the glory of the past.
For all the future holds before us, 
Let hot the hour go by again,
That evi-n now is booming o'er us. 
Bury all discord and all strife,
Bach spirit of peace stifle.
Come forward at your country’s call, 
And learn how to use a rifle.

EVENTS OF INTEREST 
AT OTHER COLLEGES
The second of! a series o£ lectures 
on the various phases of the graphic 
arts was delivered Friday evening 
in Jioom 104 of the Industries build­
ing. The subject, "Color and Its Re­
lation to Printing," was extremely 
well-treated by Arthur S. Allen, who 
is a recognized authority on color. Mr. 
Allen is president of the American In­
stitute of Graphic Arts, and Sales 
Manager of Philip Ruxton, Inc., the 
well known manufacturers of printing 
inks. lie brought with him a large 
number of examples which served to 
bring out the points of his talk very 
effectively. 1-Ie also explained in de­
tail the use of the various charts of 
the Munsell system, which is rapidly 
being adopted by the most progressive 
printing establishments and textile 
manufacturers in the country.
The lecture was well attended by a 
number of men connected with the va­
rious commercial offices of the city as 
well as the members of the Depart­
ment of Printing. These lectures 
have been arranged by the Commit­
tee 011 Education of the United Typo- 
thetas of America as a contribution to 
the work of the Department of Print­
ing. Other subjects and speakers will 
be announced later.

STUDENTS ADDRESSED 
BYi ADVISORY ENGINEER
Last Wednesday the Science men 
witnessed one of the most interesting 
assemblies of the year. It was in all 
respects a military assembly from the 
opening remarks by Dean Mott, on the 
details of the military drill, to the 
last scene of the moving pictures, 
which brought the meeting to a close. 
The presence of the soldiers, so fre­
quently seen around the campus, now­
adays, lent a still further military as­
pect to the gathering. Mr. Knowles, 
consulting engineer and professor at 
the University of Pittsburgh, gave a 
talk on Camp Meade, Maryland, illus­
trated by slides. Mr. Knowles himself 
played a big part in the construction 
of this cantonment. The talk was fol­
lowed by moving pictures, illustrating 
how the camp was constructed and 
showing the general layout, including 
the accommodations for the men. The 
subject was peculiarly appropriate as 
many Tech men will in a short time 
bo stationed at some similar canton 
ment if not Camp Meade itself. The 
pictures were interesting not only 
from the military viewpoint, but also 
as engineering problems. Six build­
ings wore completed every day on an 
average. It is hoped that Mr, Knowles 
will come back to Tech again soon 
with another talk as instructive as his 
first ono.

CLASS DEBATE
A most interesting and warmly de­
bated discussion took place last Friday 
morning at 10:80 between the mem­
bers of the class in Advertising in the 
Department of Printing. The subject 
took the following title, "Resolved, 
that Advertising is an Economic 
Waste," and was supported by Messrs. 
Wheeler and Denman while Messrs. 
Dahl and Foss took the negative side. 
After a lengthy discussion during 
which Messrs Ebaugli and Courter act­
ed as judges the case was decided in 
favor of the negative side, namely, 
that Advertising is not an Economic 
Waste.
These discussions are a feature of 
the work of John T. Boyle, instructor 
in advertising, proving both enjoyable 
and helpful to those who particpate in 
then,i.
No pro-German, pacifist or even 
neutral sentiment will be tolerated 
from any member of the faculty of

mous decision of the board of trus­
tees at its meeting last week.

to Harvard men on military service 
abroad. A letter received by Presi­

at many of the colleges in England to

sire to spend some part of-tlieir short 
leave at Cambridge and Oxford.

Further postponement of the Colum­
bia plan for a committee of reference 
to settle issues arising at the univer­
sity was announced after a meeting 
of the trustees on Dec. 11. The rec­
