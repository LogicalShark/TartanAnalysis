Arti?cial imagination: CMU lab automates video “fakes”
GABRIEL BAMFORTH
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon PhD student 
Aayush Bansal is teaching 
computers how to imagine. 
Working with professors Deva 
Ramanan and Yaser Sheikh of 
the Robotics Institute, Bansal 
recently developed an algorithm 
which has made a splash in both 
academic and mainstream media. 
His method, titled Recycle-GAN, 
autonomously transfers the 
contents of one video to another, 
while making sure that the style 
of the target is retained. For 
example: imagine watching a 
video of Donald Trump speaking, 
in which his mannerisms, voice, 
and facial movements are those 
of Barack Obama. Or a time-lapse 
rose blooming in the style of an 
azalea. This is all possible with 
Recycle-GAN.
The approach combines the 
functions of two recent AI proj-
ects, OpenPose and Cycle-GAN, to 
track the movement of key points 
from one video and transfer 
that movement to the image in 
a similar video. The project’s 
website shows the final prod-
uct on multiple different videos, 
with original footage next to 
the retargeted footage of people 
speaking, flowers blooming, sun-
rises, origami birds flying, and 
robotic arms picking up objects.
Prior work in this field has 
been aimed specifically at facial 
retargeting, but Bansal’s research 
team has broadened the appli-
cations of the technology. “We 
aren’t using any specific facial 
information,” he explained from 
his desk in Smith Hall, which is 
littered with philosophy books 
and Disney-Pixar posters. “We 
just wanted to see if we could 
automatically learn the video 
retargeting or not.”
Video retargeting is not new 
technology — Hollywood has 
been doing it for more than 20 
years. Animators in Furious 7 
created a digital version of Paul 
Walker, who died before they 
finished shooting the movie. 
But until now, tasks like that 
required a team of artists. With 
Recycle-GAN and programs like 
it, virtually anybody can generate 
retargeted videos — the code is 
freely available on GitHub.
For some, this is cause for 
worry. In April 2018, BuzzFeed 
released a video of Jordan Peele’s 
now famous “deepfake” video 
showing a convincingly-rendered 
Barack Obama saying a number 
of things the actual Obama 
probably never would. Peele’s 
video warned the public that 
deepfakes are a threat to reliable 
information, prompting a recent-
ly released CNN investigation 
titled “the Pentagon’s Race 
Against Deepfakes,” which sum-
marized the history of video 
augmentation and the current 
research on both generating and 
detecting fabricated audiovisual 
content.
Bansal’s research was 
mentioned in the report, and 
though he resents the term 
“deepfake,” he made his opinions 
clear on the topic: “Whenever 
a user is looking at a video, she 
or he should know if it’s a real or

Last Thursday, it was 
announced that Dr. Larry 
Pileggi, longtime Carnegie 
Mellon researcher and professor, 
was going to be the new Dean 
of the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department, 
effective Mar. 2019.
Pileggi, who received his 
doctorate in Electrical and 
Computer Engineering at 
Carnegie Mellon in 1989, has 
earned several distinctions 
throughout his career: the 
announcement press release 
notes that Pileggi, “an innovative 
researcher,” has “published 
more than 350 conference and 
journal papers and holds 40 U.S. 
patents.”
In addition to this, Pileggi 
has received awards for his 
developments in integrated 
circuit design, secure hardware, 
and power systems research, 
with a Presidential Young 
Investigator award from the 
National Science Foundation, 
a Semiconductor Research 
Corporation Aristotle award, 
and Westinghouse Corpora-
tion’s highest engineering 
achievement award, among 
several others.
Outside of the classroom, he’s 
also a renowned poker player: 
last year, he finished in the top 
three percent of contestants 
at the World Series of Poker in 
Las Vegas, walking away with 
earnings of over 30 thousand 
dollars.
The department Pileggi is 
inheriting is one of both great 
prestige and continued growth. 
Currently, U.S. News and World 
Reports ranks both the graduate 
and undergraduate Electrical 
and Computer Engineering 
programs as among the top 
ten best in the world, with 
the undergraduate Computer 
Engineering program ranking 
first globally.

Special to The Tartan
Last semester, a Campus 
Lighting Pre-Investigation Paper 
(PIP) was presented to the 
Senate’s general body regarding 
the lack of outdoor lighting 
on campus. After the PIP was 
approved by the Senate, the 
Campus Life Committee took it 
upon themselves to investigate 
the problem.
Last week, we met with the 
Carnegie Mellon administration 
to inform them of the problem 
with the lack of lighting. This 
benefits the undergradu-
ate population because it will 
hopefully provide more lighting 
all around campus, making it a 
nicer and safer place to walk at 
night. This PIP was inspired by 
a student suggestion that the 
campus felt unsafe at night. 
Actions will hopefully come into 
effect soon after the proposal is 
presented.
Additionally, Carnegie 
Mellon President Farnam 
Jahanian is coming to Senate’s 
General Body Meeting next 
Thursday. He will be joining 
the members of Senate to 
discuss topics relating to school 
administration and what has 
been accomplished so far this 
school year. President Jahanian 
will be presenting things from 
his perspective on different 
important topics affecting stu-
dents and the campus as a 
whole.
The meeting will serve as 
an opportunity to learn what 
the role of university president 
means, ask questions about 
what President Jahanian has 
been working on, and possibly 
even suggest ideas that you 
may have about aspects of the 
university that the president has 
control over. This is a public, 
annual event, so feel free to stop

generated content. We should 
beable to tell people if it’s a real 
video or fake.” His Recycle-GAN 
algorithm can help researchers 
working on deepfake detection 
methods by generating data for 
them: instead of paying a team 
of highly-skilled digital artists 
to make a retargeted video, 
researchers could just pass two 
clips into his algorithm and 
generate their fakes in a matter 
of minutes.
The key to this kind of 
technology is an old idea but 
a fairly new research topic: 
artificial imagination. “If you 
can’t collect data, create it,” 
joked Bansal. One of his earlier 
projects involved taking a black-
and-white, unshaded outline 
of a stiletto heel and uploading 
its visual data to an AI program 
that generates several different 
colorized and shaded sketches 
of what that shoe could look 
like. This task might be easy for 
a human; every time we read a 
description or see a black-and-
white photo, our imagination 
creates a more complete image 
for us. For a computer, however, 
this process is complicated: 
the program must accept an 
incomplete signal and generate 
multiple plausible outputs from 
it.
This technology has 
implications far beyond  
deepfake videos. Bansal 
imagines a future where 
programs like Recycle-GAN will 
be able to create data which 
can’t be captured. Self-driving 
cars, for instance, mostly have 
accidents when it is dark, rainy, 
or misty, because their sen-
sors have trouble interpreting 
visual data in these settings. 
“We could use a lot of data 
from good weather conditions 
to try and simulate data for bad 
weather conditions,” he offered. 
Another potential use includes 
documentation: if several 
different people film the same 
event from different locations, 
retargeting algorithms could 
potentially stitch the separate 
2-D footage together to create a 
3-D virtual reality version of the 
event.
Bansal’s personal hopes 
for the technology’s future lie 
in entertainment. “I have a 
fascination with animation,” 
he said, adding that he wants 
this technology to make the 
animation process quicker and 
easier for companies like Pixar 
and Dreamworks, so that more 
stories can be created. “Story-
tellers shouldn’t have to worry 
about how their stories will 
be told,” he said, “I’ve always 
thought that people’s ideas are 
just sitting on the shelf because 
they don’t have sufficient 
resources to make them.”
Whether those ideas are safer 
autonomous cars, more accurate 
video evidence, false videos of 
someone saying things they never 
said, or the next Disney-Pixar 
blockbuster, one thing is certain: 
Recycle-GAN will make the road 
to creation much easier.

FBI talk emphasizes 
hate speech’s impact   
Larry Pileggi named new ECE dean 
“we also have significant faculty 
leadership and excellent staff 
within the department, who 
along with the interim depart-
ment head James Hoe, were able 
to keep things running smoothly 
during the department head 
search process.”
According to Pileggi, some of 
the greatest challenges facing the 
department are the difficulties 
of adapting to and integrating 
“online learning tools with 
material and videos covering 
every problem and topic.” 
With material that is “always 
advancing and evolving,” Pileggi 
says that keeping up with “the 
changing landscapes” of the field 
including machine learning and 
artificial intelligence research 
will be a major test for the 
department.
Regardless, the “roots” of 
the department, which centers 
upon the importance of applied 
research “mostly driven by the 
needs of industry and defense,” 
will not be changing anytime 
soon. Since the “founding [of the 
engineering school] as Carnegie 
Tech for the training of persons 
from the local industry,” these 
industry-and defense-driven 
roots run deep.
The growing intersection 
between technology, society, 
and business has also been 
a driver in development at 
Carnegie Mellon for years, with 
the Tepper Quadrangle hav-
ing opened this year, and the 
recent partnership between 
CIT and the Army Research 
Laboratory. Pileggi echoes this 
sentiment: “it is quite apparent 
that the next few decades will 
be focused on research that is 
to advance specific applications 
and societal/defense needs.”
Pileggi describes the 
Electrical and Computer 
Engineering department as 
having “seen evolution and 
trends over the past 100 years 
for Electrical Engineering,” 
so it is no surprise that he is 
optimistic about their future. 
In the coming days, he is “hop-
ing to announce some exciting 
changes in the not too distant 
future, where we build upon 
our solid base to aim for even 
higher heights.”

behavioral indicators. Potential 
active shooters often espouse a 
“grievance narrative” against 
an entire group, praise past 
attacks and have a history of, or 
fascination with, violence.
Agent La Salle Burka showed 
a third-grade report card of the 
Pulse nightclub shooter, Omar 
Mateen. It described Mateen 
as prone to “verbally abusive, 
aggressive behavior.”
The FBI agents showed the 
most common logos of white 
supremacist groups. The Othala 
rune, an antiquated Viking 
symbol, is being used in place of 
the swastika. The Nazi symbol 
has reportedly become too 
identifiable.
“The internet has created 
a way for people to access 
information without any group 
affiliation,” emphasized Agent 
Moore. The agents emphasized 
that the FBI can only search 
online for dangerous and 
offensive material if it has been 
reported to them. Additionally, 
it is important that alarmed 
citizens take a screenshot of 
hateful material they come 
across before reporting it. 
Hateful material is often 
removed shortly after it has 
been posted, they stated.
Agents Trosman and Pulcatro 
emphasized resisting the urge 
to debate or engage with people 
who post hate-speech on social 
media, since “it is not worth 
putting [yourself] at risk of 
harassment, violence, or dox-
ing,” each common tactics by 
hate groups.
“Take your community 
back,” urged Agent Pulcastro. 
“Don’t tolerate it, report it.”

Polar vortex elicits power of student activism
Winter this year was 
unexpectedly harsh, bringing 
record-breaking low temperatures 
and at least 20 casualties 
throughout the American Midwest. 
Caused by the breakdown of 
the polar vortex, as a result of 
climate change, the sudden cold 
snap ground entire states to a 
halt and trapped people within 
their homes, while those without 
shelter were left at the mercy of 
the elements.
Here on campus, students 
were spared the cold thanks to 
the cancellation of classes on 
Jan. 30, and Jan. 31. A few hours 
before announcing the decision, 
the university sent out an email 
to all students about taking 
precautions against the extreme 
cold, making it seem that classes 
would be still be held despite 
the weather. This email stoked 
fears of confronting the ungodly 
temperatures, so students banded 
together and created an online 
petition appropriately titled 
“Cancel Class on Wednesday” that 
garnered nearly 3,500 signatures, 
equivalent to around half of the 
undergraduate class.
Regardless of whether the 
petition had any in?uence on the 
outcome, it does show that when 
we, the students, want something 
to change, we can come together 
and try to make it happen. It might 
be an exaggeration to brand an 
online petition as a prime example 
of student activism, but at the 
very least, people took the time 
out of their day to make their 
voices heard. In the end, signing 
an online petition supporting the 
cancellation of classes is still a step 
above just privately complaining to 
friends or ranting on Facebook, but 
it was a small action that sparked 
some signi?cant meaning.
This raises the question: what 
else do students have the power to 
change?
College campuses have 
historically been more liberal and 
politically active than the general 
populous, with students often 
rallying around causes they believe 
in. The 20th century alone is rife 
with examples of students rising 
up and making a difference: from 
backing the Civil Rights Movement 
to protesting the Vietnam War 
to ?ghting against the political 
status quo, college students of 
the past were not afraid to speak 
out against what they saw as 
corrupt or morally wrong. Today, 
activism is more important than 
ever, especially given the present 
escalation in issues such as gun 
violence, political polarization 
and corruption, racism and 
intolerance, and economic 
inequality. With the advent of the 
internet and continued growth of 
social media, speaking out against 
something is easier than ever, and 
it is crucial for us to consider how 
we may leverage towards positive 
societal change.
We have seen the power of 
student advocacy in the past as well. 
In 2016, students and professors 
helped 80 CulinArt workers who 
were part of the Service Employees 
International Union (SEIU) to 
raise their wages from $13.35 to 
$16.75, allowing the workers to 
earn wages that were on par with 
workers in nearby universities 
like the University of Pittsburgh 
and Duquesne University and 
lead more comfortable lives. 
Because there were students and 
professors who cared enough for 
the employees that help run the 
university, the union was able to 
gain enough power to create a new 
contract for these workers.
Does that mean you should go 
out right now and start a protest 
over any nationally controversial 
issue? Not necessarily; Carnegie 
Mellon does not have as impressive 
a legacy of student activism as 
other universities. Rather, we 
should begin with the problems 
immediately af?icting our campus 
and our community.
Anyone can see that our 
university has its fair share of 
issues, from the continuous cycle 
of constructing and removing 
the massive tents for orientation 
and major campus events that 
leave behind ugly ?elds of 
mud, the mistreatment of food 
workers by Chartwells, Carnegie 
Mellon’s food contractor; the 
ethical questions surrounding the 
increased collaboration between 
the Department of Defense and 
the university on projects such 
as the AI Task Force, and the 
displacement of local residents 
through continued acquisition of 
nearby apartment buildings.
No matter what your 
perspective may be on these 
various issues, it does not change 
the fact that students have both 
the power and responsibility to 
hold the university accountable 
for its actions and to foster a 
better community both on and off 
campus. Solving these problems 
may seem daunting, and it will 
likely require more than just an 
online petition, but that does 
not mean we shouldn’t try. One 
person griping about rising tuition 
rates might not make much of a 
difference, but a well-organized 
group of a few thousand is 
certainly a force to be reckoned 
with. If we, as a student body, 
collectively make it clear that we 
want scholarships to meet full 
demonstrated need instead of 
trying to pad our endowment, we 
may be able to better in?uence 
decision makers.
Banding together and acting 
in unison might sound like a lot of 
work, but the payoff far exceeds 
the cost. Not only could we change 
Carnegie Mellon for the better 
and leave an indelible mark on 
our institution, but we could 
extend beyond our campus and 
impact the world. We should begin 
establishing a tradition of student 
activism, because as idealistic and 
cliché as it may sound, we must 
be the change we wish to see, and 
working together is the best way to 
move towards a brighter future.
CMU SDS opposes Army AI Task Force
STUDENTS FOR A DEMOCRATIC 
SOCIETY
Special to The Tartan
Last week, The Tartan 
reported on Carnegie Mellon’s 
latest partnership with the U.S. 
military, the Army AI Task Force. 
As the article states, “the Army 
AI Task Force represents only 
the most recent chapter in a 70-
year history of Carnegie Mellon 
working with the Department of 
Defense.” Nevertheless, this is a 
particularly outrageous chapter, 
and the justi?cations for it are 
deceptive and inhumane.
In support of the Task Force, 
Army Futures Commander 
General John Murray says that 
“the ‘character of war’ continues 
to evolve,” citing “quantum 
computing, ventures into space, 
directed energy, AI, and machine 
learning.” He predicts that very 
soon, “arti?cial intelligence will be 
‘in everything, and everywhere.’”
In this way, General Murray 
seems to portray technological 
change as a natural force that 
humans don’t cause and couldn’t 
possibly redirect. In fact, the 
U.S. military has intentionally 
brought AI into war, dumping 
military funding into related 
technical areas. Their strategy 
has been to incentivize engineers 
and scientists at universities like 
Carnegie Mellon to work for war 
pro?teers, to coax them into 
ignoring their conscience even 
as people everywhere, including 
in this country, are increasingly 
skeptical of the U.S.’s status as 
“leader of the free world.”
The U.S. military is currently 
occupying or bombing seven 
countries throughout the Middle 
East and North Africa, and it 
maintains special operations 
forces in over 100 others. It 
provides weapons, targeting 
assistance, and diplomatic 
support to the human rights-
abusing regime of Saudi Arabia 
even as that government carries 
out a genocide in Yemen and 
regularly locks up and executes 
activists and dissidents from 
its own country. Right now, 
the U.S. military is threatening 
undemocratic regime change 
in Venezuela and Iran. To be 
clear, this is the institution that 
Carnegie Mellon’s AI Task Force is 
supporting.
According to General Murray, 
the Carnegie Mellon-Army 
partnership will both “make our 
soldiers and units of the future 
more effective,” and “better yet” 
create a situation where “there 
will be nobody in the world who 
will challenge [the U.S.].” The 
General’s ?rst point is a typical 
canard of pro-war discourse: 
even if you disagree with U.S. 
foreign policy, you should support 
any decision that “helps the 
troops.” We should reject this 
framing. The central issue is not 
the soldiers and units, but the 
policies they are carrying out: 
coups, bombings, and other acts 
of unprovoked violence. Why 
should we want such policies 
made “more effective”?
With his second point, 
General Murray betrays a desire 
for total U.S. domination. But 
we have seen, since 9/11, how 
U.S. occupation of regions like 
the Middle East has not brought 
ordinary people great bene?ts 
— to put it mildly. Globally, 
income and wealth inequality 
are increasing. Climate change 
and environmental degradation 
are accelerating. Migration 
crises, horrible in their own 
right, are creating political space 
for rising fascist movements in 
Europe, Asia, South America, 
and elsewhere. This is how things 
stand now, with the massive U.S. 
military encircling the globe, 
commanding advanced weaponry 
that our closest competitors could 
hardly dream of. Does it seem just 
to give the military even more 
power?
Discussing advances in AI, 
Secretary of the Army Mark T. 
Esper argues that “whoever gets 
there ?rst” will be given a “decisive 
edge on the battle?eld for years 
to come.” Again, this implies 
that changes in technology are 
simply occurring somewhere “out 
there” in the wild, with the Army’s 
technologists “discovering” them. 
In reality, U.S. leaders are actively 
fostering these changes in a race 
to the bottom with similarly 
militaristic war planners in China 
and Russia.
We don’t have to approach the 
issue that way. After decades of 
bloody proxy wars, it was direct 
negotiations that ended the Cold 
War with the Soviet Union in 1989. 
If negotiations had been more 
consistent, it may have ended 
much sooner. In his second term, 
President Obama’s administration 
held direct talks with Iran, a 
country that President Bush had 
relegated to the “Axis of Evil.” 
The result of Obama’s diplomacy 
was a multilateral agreement 
that made the world safer. If the 
U.S. wants to prevent AI from 
being used by China or Russia, it 
should work cooperatively with 
these and other world powers on 
a global AI weapons ban.
Instead, even our very own 
university president, Farnam 
Jahanian, is committed to war 
over diplomacy and negotiations. 
The Tartan reports that President 
Jahanian “excitedly stated 
‘Carnegie Mellon stands ready 
to assist the Army.’” This is 
unacceptable. The President did 
not seek the input of students, 
faculty, or staff before proffering 
this view on our behalf — or 
indeed, before committing 
Carnegie Mellon to the Army AI 
Task Force itself.
For our part, SDS members 
stand ready to hold the U.S. 
military accountable and check 
its power at our university. When 
President Jahanian states that 
AI military applications “bene?t 
society,” we strongly disagree. 
Any Task Force designed to 
keep the U.S. at war forever, 
dominating and controlling the 
world, is anathema to democracy, 
peace, and social justice.
If you are interested in 
helping us counter the dangerous 
relationship between Carnegie 
Mellon and war, you can learn

In 2014, then-17-year-old 
Michelle Carter made headlines 
for sending texts to her long-
distance boyfriend Conrad Roy, 
18, that encouraged him to kill 
himself by carbon monoxide 
poisoning. The text exchanges 
published show that on June 6, 
just a week before the suicide, 
Carter helped Roy conjure up a 
concrete plan to die by suicide in 
the most discreet way possible. 
On June 13, the day of the 
suicide, Roy expressed second 
thoughts before attempting, but 
Carter encouraged him to stop 
“push[ing the suicide] off” and to 
“do it.”
On Feb. 4, 2015, Carter 
was indicted, and the case was 
allowed to move forward. That 
year, Carter evoked some strong 
emotions on social media. Just 
two days before the indictment, 
she took to Twitter to post a photo 
of Roy telling him to “enjoy the 
parade from up there tomorrow” 
and that she was “[r]eally missing 
you tonight.” Although the 
judge’s order banned Carter from 
using social media, her mother 
shared photos of Carter going to 
school competitions, attending 
her senior prom, and going to 
Disney World on her behalf. 
Becki Maki, Roy’s aunt, expressed 
her distress by saying “It’s really 
hard because we don’t have our 
nephew in our lives anymore. We 
will never see him enjoy these 
milestones...He’ll never see his 
sisters go to prom, and to see 
her awaiting her manslaughter 
trial on a trip to Disney World 
with her friends, going to school 
competitions and going off to 
prom — it just seems like she 
doesn’t understand the gravity 
of the actions that have led to the 
case against her.” Now, Carter is 
sentenced to 15 months in prison 
for involuntary manslaughter, a 
stark contrast to the maximum of 
20 years that once hung over her 
head.
Exact motives have not 
been made explicit. In court, 
psychiatrist and critic of 
psychiatric medicines, Peter 
Breggin, testified to the court 
that Carter’s history of taking 
antidepressants caused her to be 
“involuntarily intoxicated” by the 
medication. “She is not forming 
the criminal intent... She’s found 
a way to use her unique power to 
help and to help this boyfriend 
— in her mind but not in his — 
to not keep making mistakes and 
not keep hurting himself.”
It is important to realize 
that medicine is not the right 
treatment for everyone. 
Psychiatric medication is a 
controversial topic, even among 
those in the field. Some patients 
react better than others, and 
anybody using medication should 
be monitored to ensure their 
safety. Many factors — chemistry, 
family history, a person’s specific 
needs, to list a few — can cause 
drastically different results from 
person to person. That’s true for 
basically any medical procedure, 
and psychiatric medication is 
no exception. Current science 
shows that antidepressants have 
potential side effects, one of them 
being increased suicidal ideation. 
Therefore, it’s possible that 
Carter had an adverse reaction to 
antidepressants.
That being said, Breggin 
has been outspoken against 
psychiatric medicines for 
decades. Breggin’s words 
reflect a dangerous trend we 
see in automatically linking 
mental illnesses with tragedies. 
Of course, the psychological 
state one was in during a 
certain situation is important 
to consider, but depression 
does not cause manslaughter. 
Antidepressants aren’t some evil 
psyche-changing substances that 
manipulate people into violent 
behavior. Placing the blame on 
medication that over one in ten 
Americans rely on to go about 
their daily lives is not only a 
careless conclusion to make but 
also dangerous. The fact that a 
psychiatrist who was educated in 
prestigious institutions and has 
practiced in the field for decades 
claimed this in court can serve as 
further validation for those who 
carry this mentality.
Additionally, Breggin never 
actually treated Carter. His 
conclusions have been drawn 
from remote speculations, not 
from directly working with her. 
Breggins claims that psychiatric 
medication flipped Carter from 
being a compassionate “helper” 
to being “apathetic.” Carter began 
taking antidepressants in 2011, 
and the couple met in 2012. In 
the beginning of the relationship, 
Carter actually encouraged Roy to 
seek professional help. Between 
then and the incident, there was 
no change in medication prior to 
the incident, so for effects to kick 
in three years after beginning 
a medication is rather unlikely. 
If antidepressants were the sole 
reason for Carter’s change in 
personality, her change should 
not have occurred during the 
relationship.
However, Carter’s response 
to the suicide makes room for 
a completely different possible 
intent. After encouraging Roy 
to die by suicide, she didn’t call 
authorities or even reach out 
for help. Prosecutor Maryclare 
Flynn argued that Carter wanted 
sympathy for being the “grieving 
girlfriend.”
There’s no concrete evidence 
for Flynn’s claim. However, 
past social media activity isn’t 
necessarily helping Carter’s case. 
Although she expressed remorse 
to her friends — allegedly 
claiming she herself “chickened 
out” of attempting suicide — 
the fact that she continued life 
as usual by completing her high 
school career, going to Disney 
World, and going to tanning 
salons all after the incident is 
a bit unnerving. Additionally, 
there is speculation that she 
took inspiration from a show she 
enjoyed, Glee. Parallels between 
quotes from Lea Michele — both 
on and off camera — have been 
made to Carter’s words in response 
to Roy’s death. “[Michele’s] just 
been my inspiration and stuff 
lately I love her haha,” Carter told 
her friend. Glee was a show that 
she admired. This has led people 
to question her motives behind 
pressuring Roy to kill himself or 
the authenticity of her mourning.
Regardless of intent, Carter 
undeniably preyed on Roy’s 
vulnerability. Would Roy be alive 
today if someone had called for 
help? It’s difficult to say. Both 
Roy and Carter struggled with 
mental health and needed further 
care, and Roy had experienced 
suicidal thoughts leading up to 
the event. However, Carter may 
have been the final catalyst who 
pushed him to end his life, and 
until we have a cure for such 
psychiatric illnesses, we must 
remain vigilant in treating those 
who are suffering.
Carter case shows misconceptions of mental health

I decided to take a break from 
the news for a while, so I ended 
up missing out on all the drama 
about the longest government 
shutdown in history. But I 
figured that the best way to get 
back into politics and news was 
to watch the State of the Union 
address. Let’s just say that there 
is a lot to break down.
The members of Congress 
chanting “USA” over and 
over was something out of a 
George Orwell novel. That’s 
what the whole speech felt 
like: an Orwellian sociopath 
emotionally manipulating 
Americans into believing loads 
of nonsense. He mixed the 
truth with lies and alternated 
between fear-mongering and 
celebrating “progress” to make 
himself sound legitimate.
There was an obvious 
inconsistency between Trump’s 
normal rhetoric and his 
rhetoric during his speech. He 
championed bipartisan politics 
right after a shutdown that 
was nothing but pure partisan 
politics and after insulting 
Chuck Schumer at a private 
event just hours before the 
address. He was clearly muzzled 
by whoever wrote his speech. 
It lacked more substance than 
usual.
Unsurprisingly, he made a lot 
of exaggerated claims during 
the speech. He exaggerated the 
job growth under his tenure, 
with more realistic estimates 
hovering around 4.9 million 
jobs being added and 454,000 
manufacturing jobs, a stark 
contrast compared to Trump’s 
claim of 5.3 million jobs with 
600,000 manufacturing jobs. 
Economic growth isn’t faster 
than ever. It’s fine, but it isn’t 
the massive accomplishment 
Trump makes it out to be 
since the growth began during 
Obama’s tenure. Of course, 
saying all of this doesn’t matter 
much. He always exaggerates 
his claims anyway, so it’s 
nothing new. What amazed me 
was how he just sprinkled in 
enough things he has actually 
done to make it seem like there 
has been improvement when 
there hasn’t been. It only goes 
to show just how much he 
treats the presidency and the 
country’s issues as a mere sales 
pitch, and many Americans are 
unfortunately buying it.
Another thing I found to 
be quite hilarious was how 
he switched between topics. 
After fear-mongering about 
immigrants for at least ten 
minutes, he went into a 
brief tangent about female 
representation in Congress. Of 
course, everyone stood up and 
clapped when that happened, 
and then proceeded to chant 
“USA” right after. It just blew my 
mind, and it was representative 
of everything wrong about the 
speech. It was all just a mere 
distraction. Of course, it’s 
wrong for him to do that, but it 
was more frustrating to watch 
the crowd play into his tactics. 
And it only gives him more 
ammunition to defend himself 
against criticisms.
In fact, his whole speech is 
designed in a way to be able 
to deflect criticism, and it’s 
very much a strategy used 
by conservatives like Ben 
Shapiro. For example, with 
abortion, he made the issue 
about the right of innocent life 
and killing babies rather than 
about women’s choice. With 
illegal immigration, he made 
it an issue of the rare instances 
of undocumented immigrants 
killing American citizens. Of 
course, when he turns those 
respective topics into the 
issue, it will force everyone 
to confront the specifics of 
what he says rather than real 
problems. It doesn’t matter 
that late-term abortions aren’t 
allowed under current law 
unless the fetus is not viable 
or a danger to the mother or 
the fact that undocumented 
immigrants are less likely to 
commit crime and that fencing 
has not worked. When the issue 
at hand is about death or some 
other sensitive topic, it makes 
any discussion surrounding his 
claims difficult and will make 
anyone who questions him 
seem callous.
In all honesty, it’s hard to 
talk about this State of the 
Union speech. It’s not new for 
Trump to lie or hide veiled 
threats in his speeches. It’s 
not like Trump said anything 
blatantly outrageous. In fact, 
the tempered discussion of 
his usual rhetoric made him 
seem almost reasonable. The 
problem is that this clearly fools 
a lot of people. He will make 
himself seem “normal” on these 
sorts of occasions to normalize 
whatever he likes to talk about.
The Democrats have a tough 
challenge ahead of them if 
they want any hope of getting 
elected. Trump knows how to 
sell his rhetoric, even if it’s all 
empty. It’s an embarrassing 
situation all around, and it’s 
going to be a long, twisted, 
annoying, frustrating, anger-
inducing road to the 2020 
elections.
Ocasio-Cortez is a diamond 
woman in a rhinestone world
CATHERINE TAIPE
Junior Staffwriter
Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 
known as AOC, is taking the 
nation by storm. From taking 
a stand on the broken system 
to making the complexities of 
American politics more accessible 
through viral C-SPAN videos and 
Instagram stories, Ocasio-Cortez 
is a disruptive tour-de-force, the 
voice of a generation ready to take 
action. We are just as ready and 
eager for her as we are completely 
terri?ed.
I understand that her politics 
are not the easiest to swallow. 
Her political stances are not 
sugar-coated phrases repeated 
over and over like a broken 
record: Ocasio-Cortez is actively 
?ghting for a Green New Deal, a 
70 percent marginal tax rate on 
those earning over $10 million 
a year, abolishing Immigration 
and Customs Enforcement (ICE), 
and establishing Medicare for All. 
With our current political climate, 
criticism of Ocasio-Cortez is almost 
a given.
However, I cannot turn the 
other cheek when critics attack her 
clothes, home life, and even her 
dance moves. The political right 
almost obsessively nitpicks every 
one of Ocasio-Cortez’s “?aws.” 
While I can agree that part of her 
rise to social media fame is the 
comebacks she tweets in response 
to her critics, which fuel more 
backlash from conservatives, I 
cannot help but look beyond the 
Twitter ?ghts and see a larger 
problem at play: when people 
of color — let alone women of 
color — enter elite spaces, they’re 
often attacked as undeserving or 
unquali?ed.
Most of the attacks Ocasio-
Cortez has faced over the past few 
months fall under the umbrella 
of conservatives questioning 
her working-class background. 
From spending the majority of 
her young life in Westchester 
County rather than the Bronx, to 
her daring to wear a black blazer 
for her Congressional orientation 
because her clothes “don’t look like 
a girl who struggles”, she has been 
critiqued over almost everything. 
It is even worse considering that 
most of the headlines coming 
of these “discoveries” involve 
reporters going out of their way to 
?nd photos of her home, “leaking” 
videos of her dancing as a college 
student and taking pictures of her 
without her knowledge. This lack 
of respect is jarring, but the worst 
part is perhaps the fact that these 
reporters want to depict her as a 
liar. Naturally, if Ocasio-Cortez 
is a liar, she does not deserve to 
represent NY-14.
Yet, not once has Ocasio-Cortez 
hidden that she did not grow up in 
the Bronx; if anything, she actively 
recognizes her privilege. According 
to Ocasio-Cortez’s campaign 
website, “It was clear to her, even 
then, that the zip code a child 
was born in determined much of 
their destiny. The 40-minute drive 
represented a vastly different 
quality of available schooling, 
economic opportunity, and health 
outcomes.”
While she did not grow up 
in the streets of the Bronx, she 
did work and spend much of her 
childhood visiting family there. 
Ocasio-Cortez has made it clear 
that she intends to ?ght for the 
people of NY-14, and her ability to 
do so should not be dramatically 
altered by the fact that she went to 
Boston University or that she grew 
up in the suburbs.
Another spate of criticism 
comes from the fact that Ocasio-
Cortez is a young woman. 
Despite the fact that Republican 
Paul Ryan was around the same 
age as Ocasio-Cortez when he 
was elected into the House of 
Representatives, a Fox News guest 
had the nerve to call her a “little 
girl.” Kellyanne Conway, Counselor 
to the President, referred to 
her as a “congresswoman who 
doesn’t seem to know much about 
anything.” These comments are 
the product of an intense double 
standard in not only politics but 
also any area work traditionally 
dominated by men, especially 
older men. Lastly, there is a need 
to prove her as unquali?ed for 
the position as representative, 
especially a position that, in our 
society, she was not supposed to 
have.
Overall, the criticisms thrown 
at Ocasio-Cortez everyday are a 
combination of deeply ingrained 
sexism and racism, as well as 
complete and utter fear. Naturally, 
Republicans are terri?ed of the 
quasi-celebrity politician, of 
the Latina from New York with 
enough spunk to inspire an entire 
generation and the charisma of a 
natural politician. Ocasio-Cortez’s 
existence, along with the rest 
of the inspiring, diverse 116th 
Congress, is a statement of our 
changing society, yet I can’t help 
but ask if simple representation is 
enough to challenge deeply rooted 
stigmas and stereotypes.
Whether at Carnegie Mellon 
University or the United States 
House of Representatives, people 
of color deal with the burden 
of constantly having to prove 
themselves in elite institutions — 
for now, at least. It is an ordeal 
that can never be put properly 
into words, but in Ocasio-Cortez’s 
case, I am relieved that she knows 
that she deserves to represent New 
York’s 14th District and that she, 
herself, worked for her of?ce on 
Capitol Hill. While her resilience 
does not erase the amount of empty 
criticisms she receives on the daily, 
it does make them all seem futile.
From one Latina to another: 
muchos éxitos, Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez.

“5G moves us to a truly 
connected society with very 
high data rates, low latency, 
and massively interconnected 
devices,” said Carnegie Mellon 
University Engineering and Public 
Policy (EPP) Department Head 
Doug Sicker, as quoted in a Jan. 
press release.
5G operates on three different 
spectrum bands (low-, mid-, 
and high-band) compared to 
4G’s two. Sicker, along with Kazi 
Mohammed Saidul Huq of the 
Instituto de Telecomunicações 
in Portugal and EPP Carnegie 
Mellon graduate student Rohit 
Singh, is working not to develop 
5G technology but to increase the 
bandwidth spectrum that 5G can 
take advantage of.
The “G” in 5G stands for 
“generation,” as in the ?fth 
generation of cellular communi-
cations technology. While each 
generation is de?ned by certain 
technical speci?cations, what’s 
more exciting to researchers are 
the ways each new generation of 
mobile network tech has changed 
the way we use technology in 
our everyday lives. 2G gave us 
text messages and multimedia 
messages; 3G supported mobile 
internet; 4G was fast enough for 
streaming.
“Our work looks to provide 
massive amounts of new spectrum 
for IoT [Internet of Things] type 
services, particularly with band-
width-intense demands,” 
explained Sicker.
5G is especially 
suited for the Internet of Things. 
While a 5G network can support 
vastly higher speeds and greater 
numbers of users than 3G and 4G, 
the fastest 5G signals can’t pass 
through walls.
“While this may sound like 
a disadvantage, containing the 
signal in a small space like a 
building or even a room can help 
multiple users and devices reuse 
the same spectrum,” reads the 
Jan. press release on Sicker’s 
team’s work. “Furthermore, 
this containment can help 
keep harmful interference to a 
minimum, allowing the same 
frequency to be used from one 
house to the next without getting 
in each other’s way...5G Advanced 
opens up a whole new world of 
possibility for connected indoor 
devices: smart thermostats and 
refrigerators, security systems, 
even integrated sensors to monitor 
building health.”
Telecom giants are understand-
ably looking to 5G as their next big 
draw for customers, and things 
are heating up as widespread 5G 
draws nearer on the horizon.
On Thursday, Sprint ?led a 
federal lawsuit against AT&T, 
accusing the company of inten-
tionally misleading customers 
that their phones were already 
receiving 5G network speeds.
“Some 5G networks are 
technically live 
already,” writes Michael Simon 
in a PCWorld report, “but they’re 
limited to home-based broadband 
and hotspots in certain areas of 
the U.S…there won’t be…nation-
wide coverage until at least 2020.”
While AT&T does operate a 
small number of 5G hotspots, 
Sprint’s concern is actually 
with AT&T’s 4G services. 
While connected to AT&T’s 4G 
networks, some AT&T devices 
have replaced the 4G LTE icon 
with “5GE.” 5GE does not meet 
the technical de?nition of 5G — 
it’s a slightly faster 4G network 
— but according to AT&T, this 
stands for “5G Evolution,” as in 
an evolution in technology that 
will eventually lead to 5G. “We 
feel very comfortable with how 
we have characterized the new 
service that we’re launching,” said 
AT&T CEO Randall Stephenson 
on CNBC Friday morning.
“In its claim, Sprint said it 
commissioned a survey that 
found 54 percent of consumers 
believed the 5GE networks were 
the same as or better than 5G, 
and that 43 percent think if they 
buy an AT&T phone today it 
will be 5G capable, even though 
neither of those things are true,” 
explains Engadget news editor 
Richard Lawler. “The signi?cance 
of AT&T’s deception cannot be 
overstated,” reads the claim.
“We understand why our 
competitors don’t like what we 
are doing, but our customers 
love it,” said AT&T in a 
statement to the press. If 
Sprint’s suit is successful, 
AT&T will no longer be 
allowed to use “5GE” in 
their marketing.
Rather than using cutting-
edge tech to boost corporate 
rivalries, Carnegie Mellon’s 5G 
research is fostering interna-
tional collaboration. Sicker’s 
transatlantic team represents 
CMU Portugal, a research partner-
ship program with the Instituto 
de Telecomunicações in Aveiro, 
Portugal. “We are excited about 
this initial work,” Sicker said, “and 
we hope to go after much bigger 
projects with our colleagues in 
Portugal in the future.”

The heart is the most essential 
human organ, regulating blood 
?ow to every other part of the body. 
Engineers at Dartmouth College’s 
Thayer School of Engineering 
have developed a device that can 
convert the kinetic energy of this 
important organ into electricity to 
power implantable devices.
Millions of people rely on 
pacemakers, de?brillators, 
and other vital implants 
that run on batteries 
that need to be 
replaced every ?ve 
to 10 years, a compli-
cated and expensive 
procedure that puts 
patients at risk for 
infection.
“We’re trying to 
solve the ultimate 
problem for any 
implantable bio-
medical device,” 
said Dartmouth 
engineering pro-
fessor and lead 
researcher on the 
project John X. J. 
Zhang in a press 
release. “How do 
you create an effective 
energy source so the device 
will do its job during the entire 
lifespan of the patient, without 
the need for surgery to replace the 
battery?”
Funded by the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH) 
and published as the cover 
story for Advanced Materials 
Technologies, the study was a 
three-year collaboration between 
researchers at Dartmouth and 
clinicians at University of Texas 
Health San Antonio.
The team invented a dime-
sized modi?cation to existing 
pacemakers that continually 
charges their batteries using a lead 
wire that converts kinetic energy 
from the heart. They introduced 
a thin polymer piezoelectric 
?lm called PVDF which, when 
designed with porous structures, 
can convert small mechanical 
motion to electricity. In addition, 
the same technology has potential 
for integration with sensors to 
allow doctors to monitor patients’ 
conditions in real time.
“Of equal importance is that 
the device not interfere with the 
body’s function,” said Dartmouth 
researcher and ?rst author Lin 
Dong. “We knew it had to be bio-
compatible, lightweight, ?exible, 
and low pro?le, so it not only 
?ts into the current pacemaker 
structure but is 
also scalable for 
future multi-func-
tionality.”
Engineers estimate that 
the technology is around ?ve years 
away from commercialization. 
The team will use the next two 
years of their NIH funding to 
complete the pre-clinical process 
and obtain regulatory approval.
“We’ve completed the ?rst 
round of animal studies with 
great results which will be 
published soon,” said Zhang. 
“There is already a lot of 
expressed interest from the major 
medical technology companies, 
and Andrew Closson, one of the 
study’s authors working with Lin 
Dong and an engineering Ph.D. 
Innovation Program student 
at Dartmouth, is learning the 
business and technology transfer 
skills to be a cohort in moving 
forward with the entrepreneurial 
phase of this effort.”

As 5G makes headlines, CMU engineers look to the futureUsing the heart to power pacemakers
Disease surveillance can detect any virus 
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
During the Zika virus outbreak, 
public health of?cials attempting 
to stop the virus from spreading 
further and scientists trying to 
understand its genetics were limited 
by the fact that the blood of a sick 
patient does not contain very many 
Zika virus capsids. In response to 
the outbreak, researchers in Broad 
Institute scientist Pardis Sabeti’s 
laboratory developed a new 
computational method known as 
the Compact Aggregation of Targets 
for Comprehensive Hybridization 
(CATCH) method, which they 
believe can help overcome that 
major hurdle in disease detection.
This new method involves 
designing molecular baits for 
infectious viruses and each of their 
possible strains. Baits are molecular 
probes composed of short DNA 
or RNA strands, which pair with 
complementary viral DNA strands. 
Because this method is more 
adaptable to different viruses, it 
allows smaller sequencing centers 
worldwide to conduct disease 
surveillance in a cheaper and more 
ef?cient manner.
The study was led by Hayden 
Metsky, a graduate student 
from MIT, and Katie Siddle, a 
postdoctoral researcher also 
from MIT. According to Christian 
Matranga, a co-senior author 
of the study, advanced genomic 
sequencing tools like CATCH will 
help scientists to detect outbreaks 
earlier and gather more data on 
pathogens than previously possible.
Older virus surveillance tools are 
not quite as effective as CATCH. In 
the past, scientists have often made 
use of metagenomic sequencing, a 
method of sequencing which scans 
through all the genetic material 
in a given clinical sample, making 
low-abundance viruses like Zika 
detectable. However, the major ?aw 
of this method is that it typically 
misses some viral material which 
is hidden within a variety of other 
microbes as well as the patient’s 
DNA.
Another method was enriching 
a sample for some given virus 
by immobilizing a target virus’s 
genetic material with a genetic bait. 
The rest of the genetic material is 
then washed away, leaving only the 
virus’s genetic material. Although 
this has worked successful in the 
past for analyzing the viral genomes 
of Ebola and Lassa, the probe 
designs only worked for a single 
microbe. Therefore, researchers 
had to know exactly what they were 
looking for when using molecular 
baits.
Compared to past approaches, 
CATCH is a major improvement. The 
CATCH method permits those using 
it to design custom probes which 
can capture the genetic material 
of any microbial species, including 
any virus which can infect humans. 
A user then inputs genomes 
taken from the National Center 
for Biotechnology Information’s 
sequencing database into CATCH. 
CATCH then determines the sets of 
probes most ?tting for whatever a 
user would like to recover and sends 
this information to a company that 
synthesizes probes.
Tests of some CATCH probes 
have already shown promise. A 
few probe sets’ sequencing data 
contained more than 18 times the 
viral content than before enrich-
ment, which allows researchers to 
generate more complete genomes 
from this data than they were able 
to before. Another set of CATCH-
designed probes were able to rescue 
samples of Lassa virus from 2018 
that were unable to be sequenced 
without enrichment. The research 
team also greatly improved viral 
detection in samples composed of 
unknown sequences coming from 
both patients and mosquitoes.
The research team has been 
working with other scientists in 
West Africa to establish laboratories 
and furnish them with equipment 
capable of analyzing pathogen 
sequences. In this region, viral 
outbreaks and fevers that cannot 
be clearly diagnosed are common, 
so Siddle hopes that CATCH will 
allow scientists to more ef?ciently 
perform metagenomic sequencing. 
For fevers especially, CATCH allows 
for further investigation if they 
are suspected of having a viral 
cause. As for future applications, 
the research team hopes it can be 
useful for clinical diagnoses. The 
team believes that CATCH can also 
improve large scale high-resolution 
studies of microbial communities.
CATCH-designed probes were able to 
rescue samples of Lassa virus from 
2018 that were unable to be sequenced 
without enrichment.

@PghEventsOce
match is some form of point 
scoring: a touchdown or ?eld 
goal or safety. Yet, the breaks in 
football don’t only come after 
point scoring. There are breaks 
for team timeouts, television 
timeouts, play reviews, two-
minute warnings, turnovers, and 
most other breaks in the action, 
which means commercials don’t 
really come during breaks in 
action. They interrupt the action. 
By ending some action with 
concrete evidence of growth or 
loss, the match becomes less 
stilted, and the commercials 
come at a satisfying conclusion 
to a segment of the action.
That isn’t to say the 
competitive Melee scene comes 
without its faults. Football has its 
fair share of issues, like baseball 
and soccer and every other 
human sport, and competitive 
Melee is no exception. 
Hungrybox has been the top 
player in competitive Melee for 
a few years now, and it’s due 
in part to the defensive style of 
play with Jigglypuff that works 
in tandem with the time limit on 
each game. He’s able to protect 
himself against aggressive 
players that get worn down by 
the end of the clock. Freda says 
that “despite his massive success, 
competitive play is being 
destroyed. Many professional 
players are citing Hungrybox’s 
Jigglypuff as the reason they’re 
quitting the competitive scene. 
It’s going to kill the professional 
Melee scene, viewership of it, 
and therefore, the amateur scene 
in Melee.” People don’t like to 
play if they know they’ll lose, 
and people don’t like to watch it, 
either.
Somehow, in spite of the 
potential issues raised by a 
defensive play style in a short 
clock system, the grand ?nals 
at Genesis 6 were nail-biting. 
In the ?rst game, both players 
had stock percentages in each 
character’s kill zone after losing 
three of their four stocks, and 
taking the ?rst game by the 
skin of his teeth was Axe, the 
underdog. However, Hungrybox 
handily took the second game, 
with two stocks remaining at the 
end, to knot the series at one. 
And a tense third game set the 
tone for the rest of the series. 
After trading stocks down to 
one stock each, Hungrybox and 
Axe quickly traded percent into 
each character’s kill zone again, 
but this time, each player had 
trouble landing any hits as the 
game clock sank down under 
a minute. If the time runs out, 
whoever has the highest percent 
wins the game, and Axe was 
leading under a minute. Then, 
Axe choked his lead away, and 
Hungrybox wouldn’t make the 
same mistake.
One more game for 
Hungrybox and the match would 
be over. And it seemed, as the 
?rst stock progressed, that the 
fourth game wasn’t looking 
great for Axe. But Axe took the 
?rst stock from Hungrybox 
with a lower stock percent and 
didn’t look back. Axe ended the 
game with eight percent on the 
last stock, which was a big win 
in this series. It came down to 
game ?ve, ?nal stocks, and the 
last minute running out on the 
clock. Hungrybox took the lead 
in the ?nal stock, and he never 
allowed Axe back into the game, 
winning the Grand ?nals with a 
?nal stock percent of 17. 
Just like the Super Bowl, the 
Super Smash Brothers Melee 
grand ?nals at Genesis 6 came 
down to the wire in a defensive 
match that lead to another win 
for a dynasty. One was more 
interesting than the other, still, 
and I think that’s a sign of the 
times to come. Football had to 
start somewhere, and esports 
has a growing fan base for ?rst-
time and casual watchers like 
me.

A short recap of the past winter in free agency for MLB, Pirates
MATTHEW BENUSA
Sports Editor
Free agency this year for 
baseball has been slow, to say 
the least. The two names that 
are still sticking around, waiting 
for a contract to sign, are Manny 
Machado and Bryce Harper. 
As a small market team, the 
Pittsburgh Pirates are not really 
in contention for either player, 
since they’re star players look-
ing to go to a large market and 
the Pirates are unable to sign 
anybody with a contract larger 
than several million a year. 
Obviously, it’s shocking that 
Machado and Harper are still 
around, but the Pirates have 
made little headway in the free 
agent market themselves.
In recent weeks, the Pirates 
have signed mostly minor league 
deals with players past their 
prime or players who’ve never 
really hit it. Francisco Liriano and 
Melky Cabrera were signed to one 
year Minor League contracts, and 
so were the younger players Nick 
Franklin and Brandon Maurer. 
It’s classic Pirates fashion to sign 
a slew of players who will get a 
shot at Spring Training to play 
in the Majors again, but even the 
Pirates’ big-name signings this 
winter don’t carry the assured 
weight of pushing them into the 
playoffs.
Lonnie Chisenhall and Jung Ho 
Kang are the two position players 
that are poised to join — or rejoin, 
in Kang’s case — the Pirates. 
Chisenhall is a corner in?elder/
out?elder who has a career slash 
line of .268/.320/.427. He’s a 
great utility player to round out 
a roster, a veteran of an Indians 
team that has turned around 
their historic misfortunes, so he 
could be a missing piece to the 
puzzle for the Pirates. However, 
Chisenhall only ?lls the gap left 
by the injury to Gregory Polanco 
and not the desperately needed 
batting depth at shortstop. Jung 
Ho Kang does the same, with 
the positions played by Kang 
matching those of Chisenhall 
and Polanco, and his career 
slash is just slightly better than 
Chisenhall’s. After Kang’s arrest 
in the winter of 2016, his position 
with the Pirates was tenuous, but 
he’s quoted as desiring to make 
things right with the team.
For pitching depth, Jordan 
Lyles helps at the back end of the 
rotation, and with long innings 
relief, but the core of the Pirates 
rotation can be shaky. Chad Kuhl 
has an ERA above 4.0 and a WHIP 
that is well above 1.000. Trevor 
Williams had a good season last 
year, but some of his statistics 
leave questions hanging over his 
head, and Joe Musgrove is the 
same. So the Jordan Lyles signing 
is not quite inspiring con?dence 
in the Pirates pitching rotation. 
Although, there are a few free 
agents left on the market that the 
Pirates could sign to help with 
that, like Dallas Keuchel, even 
though his contract may be more 
expensive than the Pirates are 
willing to shell out. Realistically, 
the Pirates could be in contention 
for Clay Buchholz or Gio 
Gonzalez, and their ability is just 
a little more inspiring than the 
current back end of the rotation.
It’s shocking that these names 
remain in free agency, though. 
Kuechel, Buchholz, and Gonzalez 
are all players who should be on 
some form of contract, but teams 
seem to be collectively holding 
off on signing anybody whose 
name could boost the price of 
their contract. The three players 
are all pitchers, and the ?rst 
date for pitchers and catchers to 
report is this Monday. Most teams 
don’t report until Wednesday or 
Thursday, but players are ?nding 
themselves out of jobs right as 
their season is starting. With 
the MLB’s Collective Bargaining 
Agreement up for negotiation 
in two winters from now, teams 
are gearing up for an extended 
arbitration with the Player’s 
Association.
FiveThirtyEight wrote an 
article titled, “How to Save MLB 
Free Agency.” The most glaring 
detail of the article is the decline 
in average dollar value for free 
agents in the past ?ve seasons, 
with the average contract value 
dropping from $12.6 million 
in 2015-16 to $7.8 million last 
season. The Chicago Tribune 
titled an article, “Something 
is rotten about baseball free 
agency.” ESPN is calling it “The 
broken winter” and writing 
about “Why baseball must ?x free 
agency ASAP.”
There are massive issues with 
the way the MLB has been moving 
recently, with an increasing 
reliance on technology, growing 
divides between owners and 
players, and worst of all, 
potentially adding a DH to the 
National League. But this winter 
of free agency is showing some of 
the worst parts of an oligarchical 
control over a market. Workers 
aren’t getting paid the way they 
should, consumers are becoming 
despondent, and money is sitting 
in the pockets of the owners. A 
Fansided blog by a Phillies fan 
says that the Phillies are ruining 
free agency by sitting on their 
hands, waiting for the price of 
Machado or Harper or Keuchel 
to go down, but saying it’s strictly 
the fault of the Phillies Front 
Of?ce is saying that one team has 
the ability to control the entire 
free agent market, which means 
there are a few larger issues 
with the way free agency works. 
Maybe something will change in 
the next CBA, but the players and 
fans have to deal with it for now.

A slow winter season for free agency is a signal to the players and owners of a protracted CBA battle in two years.

In a doubleheader at Brandeis 
University in Massachusetts, 
the Carnegie Mellon University 
women’s and men’s basketball 
teams competed in hard-fought 
battles which ended with different 
results.
On Friday, Feb. 8, the women’s 
team (11–10) burst through in the 
fourth quarter to win their ?rst 
game in three weeks and break a 
?ve-game losing streak. For the 
men’s team (9–12), the Tartans 
found themselves in a tight game 
that ended in defeat, another 
setback after ending a ?ve-game 
losing streak of their own against 
the University of Chicago.
The women were the ?rst on 
the court, starting the game in 
a defensive battle that ended 
the ?rst quarter tied at 12 points 
apiece. In the second quarter, 
the Tartans took the lead with 
solid shooting from Junior guards 
Makayla Filiere and Megan Jaeb. 
However, the Brandeis Judges put 
together a 10-4 run to pull ahead 
of the Tartans late in the quarter. 
At the half, the Judges led by just 
one point, 28–27.
The Judges opened the second 
half strong, scoring the ?rst 
six points of the third quarter. 
However, the Tartans responded 
with a 10-3 run, punctuated by 
back-to-back three-point shots 
from Filiere to tie the score at 
37–37. Into the fourth quarter the 
Tartans trailed by ?ve points, but 
midway through the quarter, they 
took the lead 59–58. They didn’t 
allow the Judges to score for the 
rest of the game, and they added 
eight more points to the ?nal 
total, ?nishing 67–58.
Filiere led the Tartans with 
a career-high 23 points (nine of 
them in the fourth quarter), and 
she shot 4-for-6 from beyond the 
three-point arc. First-year guard 
Leah Weslock added 16 points and 
eight rebounds.
After the women left the 
court, it was the men’s team’s turn 
to take on Brandeis. Coming off a 
thrilling win at home the previous 
Sunday against the University of 
Chicago, the Tartans were looking 
to build momentum for the ?nal 
games of the season. But this goal 
came screeching to a halt against 
the Judges.
The ?rst half was a tight 
back-and-forth competition, but 
for much of the half the Judges 
controlled the pace of the game. 
Trading baskets, the Tartans 
trailed by as much as eight points, 
but in short order, Junior guard 
Colin McNeil made a lay-up and 
added a free throw to push the 
Tartans into the lead, 35–34, with 
only 3 minutes left to play before 
the break. In the ?nal seconds, 
McNeil missed a lay-up but 
Sophomore forward Ethan Miller 
tipped the ball in, setting the 
score for the second half at 40–36, 
Tartans leading.
The Tartans and Judges again 
traded shots and points coming 
out of halftime, but unlike in 
the ?rst quarter, the Tartans 
controlled the pace of the game, 
keeping their lead. They led the 
game or were tied until less than 
three minutes left in the game, 
when the Judges took the lead, 
66–64. The score was tied at 68–
68 at one minute left, but two fouls 
by the Tartans gave the Judges the 
chance to secure the game at the 
free throw line. The ?nal score 
was 72-68 for the Judges.
Senior Seth Henry led the 
Tartans in scoring with 16 points, 
while McNeil dished out six 
assists.
After traveling to New York to 
take on New York University over 
the weekend, both women’s and 
men’s basketball teams will return 
to Pittsburgh to host the University 
of Rochester next Friday, Feb. 15 
and Emory University on Sunday, 
Feb. 17. On Friday night, the 
games begin at 6 p.m. in Skibo 
Gymnasium, and on Sunday 
afternoon, the games begin at 
noon in the same location. The 
teams end their season a week 
later at Case Western Reserve 
University on Friday, Feb. 23.

Editor-in-Chief
This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention.
Okay, kids. They called in 
the Editor-in-Chief to recount 
the Superb Bowl because Matt 
could not write this week for 
some reason...something about 
athlete’s pen? That was an 
athlete’s foot joke, for those 
who do not get the reference, 
which is a kind of mold athletes 
grow because they make them 
all shower in the same place. 
But Matt cannot get that, 
because he merely writes about 
people who shower in those 
places. Hence the pen.
This made sense to me, 
because in high school, I was 
on the girl’s varsity basketball 
team for a year before being cut 
because I was bad at basketball. 
Also, I have people who are 
football players in several of 
my classes. I think people are 
too mean to the Tartans here, 
because I bet it’s really hard 
to be a student athlete, and I 
would know that because of the 
aforementioned stint as a real, 
varsity basketball player. And 
no, my high school did not have 
a junior varsity basketball team, 
or cut anyone from the varsity 
team, why are you asking?
Okay. The Super Bowl. I 
wanted to eat nachos during it 
because I really like nachos and 
it seemed like the right time 
to have them for dinner, so I 
got three orders of chips from 
Gallo, a weird frozen black 
bean enchilada casserole from 
Entropy, and various odds and 
ends of cheese. With the Gallo 
salsa mixed with some adobo 
sauce, it was really good! The 
Gallo guy asked me if I was 
having a party because I got 
three orders of chips. Alas, I 
was not.
I played Luigi’s Haunted 
Mansion (a VERY scary horror 
game) on my friend’s 3DS, ate 
my nachos, and watched local 
Vermont commercials from a 
weird illegal stream, so, all in 
all, a pretty good Super Bowl.
That’s the thing about the 
Super! Bowl. It’s like, really 
super. Like just so great. They 
pick the most superest, most 
universally adored teams and 
players, and get them all on 
the field! No one could possibly 
get upset about this most 
superlative of events because 
sports, I have heard, are entirely 
devoid of competition and 
politics and are purely about 
the joy of tossing around the ol’ 
pigskin. 
Wait — I’m being told that 
Tom Brady is on the winning 
team. I no longer stand by my 
comments because I cannot get 
behind a man who supports...
such terrible fear mongering...
such poorly-informed bigotry 
against a whole class... such ill-
supported, offensive flim-flam. 
The fact that he is allowed to be 
a public figure should be a stain 
on our society. I am referring, 
of course, to the fact that he 
DOESN’T EAT NIGHTSHADES? 
What did tomatoes and potatoes 
ever do? What a sociopath. No 
wonder he’s a fascist.

Last week, while the fascist 
Tom Brady was in the ?nal 
seconds of another Super Bowl 
win, the Genesis 6 Super Smash 
Brothers Melee grand ?nals were 
just starting. There was an easy 
analogy in the ?nals of each 
sport, with the eternal champion 
New England Patriots matching 
up against the upcomer Los 
Angeles Rams; in Melee ?nals, 
the eternal champion, Juan 
“Hungrybox” DeBediema just 
beat out the upcomer Jeffrey 
“Axe” Williamson. After the Super 
Bowl, my friends streamed the 
grand ?nals, and the consensus 
saw the Melee matchup as the 
more interesting game. Reddit 
user u/nuggetman415 wrote, 
“deciding to watch this instead of 
the super bowl was the best call” 
[sic].
There were 180,000 people 
streaming the Genesis 6 Grand 
Finals on Twitch, and just under 
100 million watched the Super 
Bowl. Both were just shy of record 
viewership numbers, but the 
Super Bowl dragged on compared 
to the fast-paced environment of 
the Genesis 6 Grand Finals. Drive 
after drive, the teams punted 
the ball seemingly without end, 
while Melee, even in a defensive 
match, has a near end: there’s 
an eight-minute time limit on 
each game. Hungrybox is known 
for a defensive style whenever 
he plays with Jigglypuff, but it 
never affects the immediacy of 
the end of the game. Football is 
a comparably bloated sport, with 
millions of dollars for a thirty-
second commercial and plenty 
of breaks in the action for the 
commercials to play.
Corporate Esports Association 
organizer and University of 
Pittsburgh student Nolan 
Freda says that Melee is “more 
comparable to tennis, with 
moments of extended action 
leading to a small victory for one 
side.” In Melee, you have to win 
?ve games of four stocks to win 
the match; tennis is six games to 
win and four points to win each 
game. With football, some will 
make the argument that each 
play is a win or loss for some team 
or the other, but the only concrete 
evidence of a team getting closer 
to a win at the end stage of the

MOVIES
This 1991 horror classic is another one of my personal favorites and available 
to view on Netflix. This creepy psychological horror thriller finds Clarice Starling 
(Jodie Foster) interviewing cannibal serial killer Hannibal Lecter (Anthony 
Hopkins) to gain insight into the mind of a killer. The film doesn’t take long to 
get under the viewer’s skin. The concept in and of itself is disturbing, but the film 
goes into it all the way without sugarcoating anything. It’s an undeniable horror 
masterpiece and a masterclass in suspense and tension. Anthony Hopkins is 
barely on screen, and yet he leaves an undeniable mark on the film’s tone. Every 
performance is directed to perfection. The script is also incredibly tight, with the 
psychological breakdown of disturbing characters like Lecter and Buffalo Bill 
providing fascinating insight into the mind of the grisly murderers and killers we 
hear about on the news. This film is the only horror film to date that has won Best 
Picture, and it is well deserved. If you haven’t seen this classic, check this out as 
soon as you can.
TV SHOWS 
This Netflix reboot of a classic 1975 sitcom has all the heart of its predecessor, 
updated for a modern audience. It follows the life of Penelope Alvarez (Justina 
Machado), a Cuban-American veteran living in an apartment with her two 
children and aging mother, played by the indomitable Rita Moreno. Other 
characters include Penelope’s privileged landlord, her meek boss, and various 
love interests. The series gained critical acclaim in its first two seasons for tackling 
serious issues such as racism, homophobia, immigration, and mental illness. 
The third season, released on Feb. 8, continues the trend, discussing drugs, 
alcoholism, teenage sex, and more. Some might accuse it of being moralistic, but 
it approaches each episode with such genuine heart that any missteps are easy to 
forgive. In an age of cinematic television and anti-heroes, it’s nice to see a sitcom 
with a consistently funny and lovable cast. One Day at a Time will make you 
laugh, it will make you cry, and it just might make you wish you were part of the 
Alvarez family as well.
NETFLIX PICKS OF THE WEEK
Silence of the Lambs
This Netflix original film is the second best in their catalog and one of the best 
films of 2015. It was sadly overlooked by the Academy at the time since it was 
a Netflix release, but that didn’t stop the film from getting the recognition it 
deserved from lovers of film everywhere. The film follows a child soldier named 
Agu (Abraham Attah) who is recruited into a guerrilla army by a warlord (Idris 
Elba) during a fictional civil war in a fictional African nation. The performance 
by Abraham Attah was one of the best child actor performances I’ve ever seen. 
He plays a battle hardened soldier so well that I forgot I was watching an actor. 
Idris Elba also gives one of his best ever performances as the unnamed warlord, 
playing a very complicated character with gravitas and bringing layers of 
empathy to his character. The film shows the horrors of war on full display, and 
the script does not shy away from exploring the consequences and complicated 
politics that goes into these kinds of civil wars. You slowly watch as these 
characters abandon their humanity for the sake of a cause, and you wonder 
if they can ever find themselves again after the atrocities they have seen and 
committed. This is a very dark film that is not for the faint of heart, but if you’re 
into war films or want a fascinating, well directed, well shot drama to watch, then 
I highly recommend this film.
Beasts of No Nation
One Day at a TimeThe Vietnam War
If you don’t know much about the Vietnam War, this 10-episode docuseries 
will leave you both disgusted and fascinated with the conflict. Ken Burns and 
Lynn Novick spent over a decade compiling archival footage, documents, 
and interviews for the project, which makes History Channel documentaries 
look like student work. It constantly shifts between U.S and Vietnamese 
narratives, starting with the revolution against French colonial rule and 
ending with Watergate. The interviews with jaded veteran foot soldiers 
are reminiscent of Walter Dean Myers’ Fallen Angels, while the interviews 
with decision-makers and historians’ analysis make it seem like the U.S had 
no choice but to invade. The Vietnam War will make you a skeptic of our 
government if you aren’t already, and with narration by Peter Coyote and 
a soundtrack featuring Jimi Hendrix, Bob Dylan, Simon and Garfunkel, and 
The Byrds, it’s a fun watch.

- Mexican War Streets
After settling into life at Carnegie Mellon 
over the past two and a half years, I 
wanted to learn more about the city 
that has come to be my home. As stu-
dents, we mostly stay in the familiar 
parts of Pittsburgh — Oakland, Squirrel 
Hill, Shadyside. Perhaps some will ven-
ture to the South Side to go shopping, 
or Downtown for cultural events, but 
there are many eclectic neighborhoods 
in Pittsburgh, from Bloomfield to the Strip 
District to Polish Hill. Recently, I decided 
to explore the Mexican War Streets of the 
North Side.
Mexican War Streets? When I first heard 
the unique name of this historic district, I 
was surprised and confused. Why would 
this be the name of a series of residential 
streets in the North Side? It turns out 
that there isn’t really a compelling or 
interesting reason why. More simply, why 
not?
In the 1840s, as Pittsburgh continued to 
grow, General William Robinson developed 
this area, calling it Buena Vista and named 
the streets after prominent places and 
people of the Mexican-American War,

which was raging on at the time. Robinson 
was the son of James Robinson, who is 
considered the first settler of the North 
Side.
Today, the Mexican War Streets make 
up a small area of Pittsburgh compared 
to other regions of the city. It’s simply 
a row of parallel streets and another of 
perpendicular ones. In its northern corners, 
it is framed by two famous art centers, the 
Mattress Factory and Randyland. It has a 
Commonplace Coffee at a street corner, 
but every other building is a townhouse. 
They vary in architectural styles, but are 
consistently colorful and unique. Some 
are red with yellow trim, others have 
symmetrical purple doors, and some are 
made of intimidating stone.
Beyond the two museums, there isn’t much 
“activity” in the Mexican War Streets per 
se. You’ll see families walking around, or 
people taking their dogs out, sure. But for 
someone like me who loves to know the 
history of how unique things came to be, 
it was great to simply walk around on a 
quiet, cloudy winter day and explore.

THE MAJOR STORIES!
21 Savage 
arrested by ICE
On Sunday, Feb. 3, Grammy-
nominated rapper, 21 Savage, was 
arrested by ICE officials in Atlanta for 
living illegally in the United States 
for over a decade. 21 Savage, whose 
real name is Shayaa Bin Abraham-
Joseph, has long been associated 
with Atlanta, GA, often performing 
with other Atlanta-native rappers 
like Lil Yachty and Migos. The agency 
alleges that 21 Savage is actually 
a United Kingdom native, having 
immigrated to the U.S. in 2005 (when 
he was 7 years old) with a visa that 
expired a year later. In an apparent 
effort to debase his character, an 
ICE official told CNN that his “whole 
public persona is false.”
While many fans were stunned by 
this news, many were also skeptical 
of the timing of his arrest. According 
to 21 Savage’s lawyers, he had filed 
for a U Visa in 2017 (which is a kind 
of visa set aside for victims of crimes 
who have suffered substantial abuse 
while in the U.S.), but the agency 
had not taken action until that 
weekend. The reason why this timing 
seems suspect? Only a few days 
beforehand, 21 Savage had released 
a music video for his song “A Lot,” 
which explicitly called out ICE’s 
inhumane border policies and called 
out Trump’s family separation policy.
He also performed the track on 
The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy 
Fallon, again criticizing the agency 
on national television. Whether or 
not this was the reason ICE decided 
to take action that weekend, 21 
Savage’s arrest shines a brighter light 
on the agency’s tendency to target 
and harm immigrants — they’ve 
tried to damage his public image 
by “exposing” his immigrant status 
and invalidating his experiences 
as a black man in America. On 
the positive side, a conversation 
surrounding the intersection of black 
identity and immigration has been 
brought to the forefront, but the 
rapper has been denied bail, and 
currently faces deportation.
Liam Neeson’s comment 
in Cold Pursuit interview
Taken actor Liam Neeson faced 
backlash over comments in a recent 
interview for his upcoming movie, 
Cold Pursuit. In Cold Pursuit, Neeson 
portrays a father set on avenging 
the death of his son. When asked 
by The Independent’s Clémence 
Michallon how he stepped into the 
revenge mentality, Neeson responded 
with an anecdote recounting how, 
after hearing how one of his 
female friends had been raped by 
an identifiable black man, he had 
deliberately searched for black men 
to fight.
He said, “I went up and down areas 
with a cosh [a bludgeon], hoping 
I’d be approached by somebody — 
I’m ashamed to say that,” he told 
The Independent in an interview 
published on Monday. “And I did 
it for maybe a week, hoping some 
[Neeson apparently gestured air 
quotes with his fingers] ‘black 
bastard’ would come out of a 
pub and have a go at me about 
something, you know? So that I could 
… kill him. [My response] shocked 
me and it hurt me. I did seek 
help. I went to a priest, I aired my 
confession, I was reared a Catholic. I 
had two very, very good friends that 
I talked to. And believe it or not, 
power-walking helped me. Two hours 
every day, to get rid of this. I’m not 
racist. This was nearly 40 years ago.”
Some praised Neeson for his 
willingness to make his past — and 
his efforts to fix it — public, but 
many have criticized him for playing 
hero with his admission. While it’s 
important for people to recognize

their own prejudices and to have the 
difficult conversations confronting 
those prejudices, Neeson’s comments 
fail to accept the truth of those racist 
comments. By saying “I’m not racist,” 
Neeson is essentially denying the 
prejudice behind his behavior and 
deflecting responsibility rather than 
taking ownership of that shame. In 
addition, a large part of the way his 
comments were perceived was due 
to the setting in which he said them. 
An interview about a movie where 
a man tries to get revenge for the 
death of his son is maybe not the 
best place to begin a dialogue about 
confronting problematic pasts.
As late-night host Trevor Noah says, 
“If Liam Neeson had told this story 
on Oprah, and there was like a 
conversation, then we would have 
seen it as a person admitting to a 
time in their life when they allowed 
their anger and hatred to fester into 
racism they’re ashamed of.” It may 
not be right to call him “brave” for 
admitting his racist past, but there 
is almost something powerful in 
confronting it so publicly. Neeson’s 
admission — information that he 
volunteered, not called out for — 
does highlight an important point: 
that society can encourage hate 
to fester inside you if you’re not 
careful, without even realizing how 
harmful that hate really is. Taking a 
moment to step back and examine 
your own actions is what allows you 
to realize that and grow. Perhaps 
with a more nuanced perspective 
and presentation, this could be a 
step forward in how society discusses 
racism in the past and present.

Biggest Day 1 Global Pop Album. 
Biggest Day 1 Global for a Female 
Artist. #1 in 84 Countries. Ariana 
Grande is back in the headlines 
this past week after releasing her 
fifth album, thank u, next (not to 
be confused with the single of the 
same name) and making music 
history. However, that’s not the only 
reason she’s been one of the most 
talked-about musicians in the past 
month. After being criticized for her 
appropriation of Japanese culture 
in the music video for “7 Rings,” 
Grande received major criticism 
for her latest tattoo: a depiction of 
Japanese characters shi and chirin on 
her palm. What was meant to mean 
“7 Rings,” in reference to her song, 
actually meant shichirin — a type of 
traditional small Japanese BBQ grill.
In the caption of the original photo, 
Grande stated that it was meant to 
be an abbreviation of the full phrase 
(seen in the “7 Rings” music video), 
shortened due to how painful the 
tattoo was. Angering and confusing 
fans, Grande doesn’t seem to have 
absorbed the criticism concerning 
her pattern of cultural appropriation 
and insensitivity. While the tattoo 
may have come from 
a genuine place, the 
lack of research seems 
to indicate a similar 
lack of respect for 
Japanese language 
and culture. A mistake 
may just be a mistake 
— and a bad tattoo 
just a bad tattoo — 
but this is one that 
could have easily been 
avoided by consulting a 
tutor. And she eventually 
did—after asking for 
help to fix her Japanese 
BBQ grill tattoo, her tutor 
explained to her that she 
could easily fix it by placing 
the character for “finger” 
directly above and in-between 
the characters she already has. 
Since Japanese is read right to left, 
top to bottom, the tattoo would’ve 
read something a little closer to 
“7 Rings.” But instead, Grande got 
the character for “finger” and a 
heart tattooed directly underneath 
the character for “7,” which 
unfortunately made it even worse. 
Rather than “7 Rings,” the tattoo now 
reads “Japanese BBQ grill, finger, 
heart” In an effort to fix the problem, 
Grande ignored what her Japanese 
tutor recommended, only to end up 
with an even worse kanji tattoo.

Last Friday, the Chinese Student Association 
(CSA) hosted their New Year Extravaganza 
around the black chairs of the Cohon 
University Center to welcome the “Year of 
the Pig” of the lunar calendar. The entire 
event was well balanced between hyped 
performances and intermittent food breaks, 
allowing the attendees to enjoy exciting 
performances while tasting indigenous Asian 
night-market food provided by different 
student organizations, such as the Japanese 
Student Association (JSA), the Korean 
American Students’ Association (KASA), and 
the Awareness of Roots in Chinese Culture 
Organization (ARCC).
I attended the event as one of the dancers 
representing KASA dance. However, it 
was a total situational irony that led me 
to the event. Even though I am Chinese, I 
did not plan to go because of a potential 
time conflict. But, as a member of KASA 
dance, I was invited back to the event as a 
performer, dancing in front of my Chinese 
friends while wearing colors representing 
Korea. Korea! I thought in disbelief. It took 
me a while to internalize the turn of the 
event without feeling weird. For those who 
are acquainted with the cultural hot pot of 
America, this probably would only merit a 
shrug, a “Yeah, so what?” But as one of the 
Chinese international students coming from a 
homogeneous society, where everything about 
New Year is patriotic and strictly emphasizes 
China, seeing outside cultural elements 
dominating the center stage was a brand new 
experience for me.
I noticed the mentality difference when 
our KASA dance choreographer, Christine, 
proposed that during our performance we 
can wear shirts with “Korea” spelled in large 
letters in the front. Out of reflex, I immediately 
uttered a jammed “no, no, no” in response to 
her proposal. For a second, she frowned and 
looked at me in confusion. At that moment, I 
realized that I could never properly translate 
my previous eighteen years of Chinese New 
Years’ experience, but can only change my 
mindset to accept and discover the beauty in 
what used to be utterly unimaginable, yet is 
now a different kind of reality.
I remember standing on the second floor of the 
UC, overlooking the crowd, seeing a variety 
of people converging at the food stands, then 
forming a semi-circle to view the performance, 
amazed by how intercultural and welcoming 
CSA had made this event to be. Each body 
feeling the beats in their own rhythm, each 
mind taking in this occasion through their 
own lenses, each person contributing a little 
something unique and taking away a little 
something unique — just like how they also 
transformed my Chinese New Year from 
family reunions, firecrackers, red decor, and 
traditional Chinese customs to now, food from 
all over Asia, people from all over the world 
and a new reality that shines in the beaming 
beauty of intercultural experience.

With the Lunar New Year, many countries 
in Asia celebrate the new year according 
to the traditional lunar calendar. In China, 
nian gao is a popular rice cake made 
to celebrate the New Year, which is also 
known as the Spring Festival. Nian gao 
literally translates to “sticky cake,” but can 
also mean “year cake” or “higher year” 
due to the homophonic nature of the 
language.
There are many types of nian gao, 
according to the different cuisines of 
various regions of China. Shanghai nian 
gao is savory and white, stir-fried with 
beef, pork, and vegetables. Northern nian 
gao is sweet to taste, usually steamed or 
fried. Guangdong’s (Canton) version is 
also sweet, with a distinct dark color due 
to brown sugar. It is steamed first, then 
fried, and dipped in egg. Traditionally, 
nian gao is steamed or fried because most 
families did not have ovens. In the United 
States, the prevalence of ovens led to the 
popularity of baked nian gao. This recipe 
is a gluten-free Chinese American baked 
concoction, closest to the Guangdong style 
that has been refined through thirty years 
of trial and error.

Yield: 25-30 pieces | Prep time: 15 minutes | Cook time: 50-60 minutes
Ingredients:
• ½ cup of rice flour
• 3 cups of sweet rice flour*
• 1 tbsp of baking powder
• 3 large eggs
• ½ cup of granulated sugar
• ¾ cup of butter
• 2½ cups of milk
• ½ can of red bean paste, whole or 
mashed
• vegetable oil (for greasing pan)
*Also known as glutinous rice flour (which 
is gluten free), sticky rice flour, or mochiko.
Directions:
Note: Using an electric mixer is 
recommended.
1. Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 
9x13-inch glass baking dish. Set aside.
2. Sift the rice flour and sweet rice flour 
into a large bowl. Mix with the baking 
powder.
3. Whisk together the eggs, sugar, and 
melted butter into the flour mixture 
until combined into a crumbly mixture.
4. Add in the milk one cup at a time, 
stirring each time for two minutes. 
Continue stirring until the batter 
is a creamy, light-yellow color and 
completely blended (more liquid than 
solid). There may be small, bead-
shaped clusters of flour in the batter 
that are difficult to mix well. Use your 
fingers to knead these clusters into the 
batter.
5. Set aside a ½ cup of batter. Pour the 
rest of the batter into the greased 
baking dish.
6. Use a teaspoon to scoop out the 
red bean paste and carefully drop 
into the batter, spreading the chunks 
throughout the dish. Do not mix the 
paste in the batter. With a new spoon, 
lightly spread the batter (previously 
set aside) over the chunks to create a 
smooth surface.
7. Place dish in the oven and bake for 
50 minutes to 1 hour, or until the 
surface is golden. If desired, broil in 
the final 2 minutes for a darker, golden 
brown color. Slice into small squares 
and serve. Can be stored at room 
temperature for up to 3 days.

N
etflix kicked off 2019 with a new series, 
Tidying Up with Marie Kondo. Organizing 
consultant Marie Kondo walks through her 
signature KonMari method in different American 
households, a method partially inspired by the 
Shinto religion that requires gathering all items 
within a certain category and keeping only those 
that “spark joy.” Earlier this month, Kondo helped 
Stephen Colbert tidy up his desk on his show.
Kondo has enjoyed massive success as an 
Internet darling who has inspired many to 
reconsider their current possessions and their 
future purchase decisions. However, she has 
received her fair share of criticism, some 
unfortunately predicated on racist beliefs. 
American political activist and journalist Barbara 
Ehrenreich posted, in a now-deleted tweet, 
that “I will be convinced that America is not in 
decline only when our de-cluttering guru Marie 
Kondo learns to speak English,” a clear jab at 
Kondo speaking Japanese on her Netflix show. 
Ehrenreich later clarified that “I confess: I hate 
Marie Kondo because, aesthetically speaking, 
I’m on the side of clutter. As for her language: 
It’s OK with me that she doesn’t speak English to 
her huge American audience but it does suggest 
written by Madeline Kim| Forum Editor

that America is in decline as a superpower.” 
Not only are these claims outwardly racist, such 
messages also imply that other cultures are not 
welcome in America. In a heterogeneous culture 
like that of the U.S., it is especially disheartening 
to see that someone with such a platform can 
believe that one culture is inherently superior to 
another and has nothing to gain from learning 
about another’s. Kondo contributes a personal 
philosophy that was crafted from her background 
and unique experiences. It’s safe to say that 
hubris does not spark joy nor productivity; let’s 
propose to — as Kondo would say — dispose of 
it.
Even some compliments made towards Kondo 
have been backhanded, painting her as ethereal 
or as something that “exists in an art gallery, 
waiting room or mausoleum.” Although these 
may not have been made with racist intentions, 
they are degrading and fall into the stereotype 
that Asian women are submissive and exotic 
creatures. There’s no denying that Kondo is 
charming and comforting, but reducing her to 
such superficial qualities is to fail to recognize 
her as an individual woman who wants to share 
her passion in self-improvement.

Marie Kondo 
and the rise of
12

---------------------------------------------------

Regardless, Kondo’s presence in the public 
sphere and overall message seems to have 
come at a perfect time. People are becoming 
more aware of the impacts of consumerism, 
leading to a wave of minimalism and anti-
consumerism. “Declutters,” where people curate 
their material collections, seem to be trending 
online. Millennials, who comprise about a quarter 
of the total U.S. population and most of the 
workforce, are especially compelled to embrace 
a more minimalist lifestyle for various reasons. 
Growing awareness of materialism and its 
environmental impacts, placing more value 
on experiences than material items, economic 
factors, and more all contribute to millennials’ 
general tendency to be more cognizant in 
their purchasing patterns. As millennials gain 
more societal influence, it appears Kondo and 
KonMari are both here to stay.
Am I encouraging you all to donate half your 
possessions and survive only on the clothes on 
your back? Of course not. Neither is Kondo. 
She discourages arbitrarily getting rid of 
items for the sole reason of reducing clutter. 
Even she understands that people find that 
some level of clutter does, as she would say, 
“spark joy.” The message she is sending is 
about being more cognizant about mindless 
spending and accumulation of material goods. 
I think we can all relate to making impulse 
decisions that ultimately end up leaving us with 
yet another dust collector. Through her work, 
Kondo inspires others to be more aware of 
what they own and be happier with it, ensuring 
that whatever they add to their lives truly adds 
value. That’s a lesson that all of us can benefit 
from.
There’s no denying that 
Kondo is charming and 
comforting, but reducing her 
to such superficial qualities 
fails to perceive her as an 
individual woman who wants 
to share her passion in self-
improvement.

Last week I ranted about Hollywood and the 
Oscars. This week I’m going to talk about an 
even more dirty industry. This industry is so sleazy, 
lazy, and fake that it makes Hollywood look like 
professionals. It’s an industry so shallow and 
devoid of meaning at this point that it is insulting 
to even call it art.
I’m referring to, of course, the music industry.
As per usual, the yearly popularity contest known 
as the Grammys are here and I am not watching 
it. There is no reason to, as there is nothing to 
get excited about. At least with the Oscars, there 
are always two movies or a few awards you 
care about. For this one, there really are none, 
because the ones you do care about mostly don’t 
show up in the actual televised event. The awards 
are all just based on who had the most listeners 
rather than an actual, 
curated pick of the year’s 
best music, interspersed 
with live performances that 
tend to be very lackluster.
Anyone with half a brain 
will know that the music 
industry isn’t about the 
music. It’s all about 
marketing. The most 
popular music that is on 
the radio for the most part 
isn’t music anymore. It’s just 
a cookie cutter, corporate, 
board-approved collection 
of computer noises and 
autotuned voices with any 
modicum of creativity left on 
the audio engineer’s floor. 
The Grammy’s Record of the Year and Album of 
the Year awards are representative of this, with a 
huge number of the songs representing everything 
wrong with the music industry.
That’s not to say there aren’t some good songs 
nominated this year. Naturally, the Black Panther 
soundtrack got a lot of well-deserved nominations 
for some good tracks. Childish Gambino’s “This 
is America” is fine but not memorable enough 
to warrant being picked for a top award by a 
supposedly prestigious institution. But there isn’t 
much else of note. All the popular music that 
came out this year was really lame for the most 
part. Once again, it’s just whatever had the most 
amount of air time on the radio or the highest 
number of total listeners. When will people realize 
that Drake is a hack with no flow or style? “God’s 
Plan” is not a good song, and Drake has been 
irrelevant since Pusha T released that diss track.
It’s also weird that there even is an award for 
deciding the best overall song of the year (instead 
of Song of the Year, which is about songwriting). 
That’s practically impossible. At least with film, you 
can compare filmmaking craft amongst genres 
and choose the best film of the year. I don’t 
think that’s even possible with music. You could 
compare composition, but most songs nominated 
for the top categories aren’t compositionally 
interesting. It’s obviously a celebration of which 
record label marketed their songs the best. Let’s 
also talk about the fact that there a shocking 
number of artists who should have nominations 
but never received one, such as Talking Heads, 
The Velvet Underground, The Strokes, Janis Joplin, 
The Who, and even The Spice Girls.
Overall, the Grammys are an absolute joke and 
no one should take them seriously. It’s obvious 
that most people don’t. The music industry is a 
sham and most of the music nominated for the 
big awards are songs that people usually dance 
to. It’s a shame that there is no genuine show 
that exists to celebrate the best of what music 
has to offer. There are some amazing artists out 
there putting out creative content like Robyn, Earl 
Sweatshirt, Brockhampton, King Gizzard and the 
Lizard Wizard, Melody Echo’s Chamber, and Blood 
Orange. But they get no recognition from the 
self-important music industry. I suppose it’s for the 
best. If they did recognize any talent, they would 
sanitize it and turn it into a shell of its former self.

Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald
This week, Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald will be screening in McConomy. This 
was reviewed in previous editions two separate times.
Personally, I can’t even pretend to like this movie or say anything good about it. It’s a confused 
mess of a film that doesn’t know what to focus on. It’s fun to watch Eddie Redmayne again, but 
he seems like he’s there for a paycheck at this point. Everyone there only seems like they were 
there for a paycheck, which I’m sure isn’t true, but the film is so lazy and incompetent that I 
can’t think of another reason anyone would sign up for the project.
The biggest crime of this film is not one of Grindelwald’s, but that it’s so boring. There is so 
much exposition throughout the whole thing that you get weighed down by it all. There also 
appears to be no consistency in the universe anymore either with the magic powers, beasts, and 
even the timeline of when certain characters are alive. The visual effects and technical side are 
all bland, the score goes unnoticed, and the action in the film is dull. I honestly can’t think of a 
single reason anyone would want to watch this, even die hard Harry Potter fans. Go see it for 
free if you’ve been meaning to, but go in with low expectations and don’t expect them to be 
met.

As we begin to think about a redesign 
here at The Tartan, our visual team has 
spent more and more time in the archive 
room pulling out old issues and paging 
through the history of our newspaper. We 
thought readers might be interested in 
looking at some of the past mastheads 
and thinking about how the paper, and 
the university, have changed over the 
years.
 
Though these mastheads, like our 
motto: “Carnegie Mellon’s only student 
newspaper since 1906,” may seem 
past-facing, we urge our readers to 
consider the same things that we’ve been 
asking ourselves for the past month in 
the archives. Namely, how should we 
undertake the next set of changes to 
improve upon what came before? What 
do we want to achieve in this redesign? 
How do we fit into this timeline, of our 
paper, and of our university? Looking 
back on the history of our paper, which 
is characterized by the influence of 
each group that came before us, we 
realize only real misstep here would be 
pretending our hands are tied.
