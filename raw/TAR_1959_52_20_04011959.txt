grams.
Since the Fine Arts Little Theater fire regulations pro­
hibit students from using backs and arms of chairs, aisles, 
columns, and stage props to in-4— 
crease the seating capacity been
necessary for all the programs 
this year, tickets will be issued in 
limited abundance for the 1959- 
^0 season.
The cover cost for the season is 
only $25.00 after March 24, 1959 
and $37.50 before said date.
Pi Delta Epsilon, sponsor of the 
WRITE Contest, is considering 
converting its cash awards of $25 
into certificates for free tickets. 
This action would certainly be a 
convenience to tl ose five lucky 
winners.
Proceeds
^Proceeds from the ticket-selling 
will be donated to a worthy cause 
—a steak and champagne dinner 
for the assembly committee.
Remaining money (if any) will 
go into a building fund for the 
construction of a smaller audi­
torium which would gve the com­
mittee adequate reason for raising 
the price of tickets, which, in turn, 
means a bigger and better party.
For the remaider of this school 
wyr, the crowds will undoubtedly 
continue to fill the Little Theater 
to triple capacity.
Crowds
While the speakers seem pleased 
to have such large audiences, the 
crowds do present certain prob­
lems.
For instance, there’s the poor 
hiccoughing fellow in the front- 
row bottom layer who spent half 
an hour trying to get out for a 
¿Cjink of water. He finally resorted 
to an under-the-chairs method.
Incidentally, the registrar’s of­
fice announced the following Fri­
day that the Carnegie Tech en­
rollment had decreased by one 
that week.
VIP S To Attend 
“Set ’em Off Again” 
Premiere April 27
Many internationally famous 
personages will travel to Tech 
April 27 for the premiere of 
Scotch ’n Soda’s 1959 production 
“Set ’Em Off Again,” publicity di­
rector Bill Pence disclosed yester­
day.
Included on the guest list are 
such dignitaries as N. Krushy, Tas 
Tse Chung, Gamul Vasser, H. 
Schnibble, Elsie Maxwell, and M. 
Monroe. (See picture.)
The S ’n S opening night com­
mittee has planned a formal din­
ner which will precede the pre­
mier performance. The banquet, 
will be held in the grand bar­
room of the Pittsburgh Tilton, 
with music being provided by Pete 
Tschaikophski and his rhythm 
boys and Phil Spitshortni’s all-girl 
“orchestra.”
Also on the program for the 
opening night banquet is the 
reading of first century poetry by 
John W. Booth, one of the original 
founders of S ’n S. In addition, 
pub’icity director Pence hinted in 
an exclusive interview that an 
exotic dance will be performed by 
a group of CIT chemistry majors.
Following the banquet, the 
group will proceed to Skibo for 
the premiere of “Set ’Em Off 
Again,” which, this year, will be 
presented in theatre-in-the-square 
and directed by Cecil B. DeNil.
Development Heads Approve New Campus Model
Top Tech officials greeted with enthusiasm the new campus model which was unveiled today. The 
new design was hailed as a giant step forward in improving Tech’s educational facilities. The model ef­
fectively combines classic lines with modern functionality.
Space Problem
One possible way of alleviating 
the space problem is to change the 
assembly hour. It seems that, 
since there is no ROTC drill on 
Tuesday corresponding to Thurs­
day’s practice, the men, in search 
of something to do with this lei' 
sure time, meander over to the 
Little Theater.
The suggestion that an extra 
ROTC practice take place during 
the 11:30 assembly has not, 
some obscure reason, been favor­
ably received by most of the 
dents involved.
>yTf, therefore, there are any stu­
dents who are not convinced of 
the tremendous overflow at As­
sembly programs, they are ad­
vised to check up on the situation. 
If, by a stroke of luck, places are 
available, the assembly committee 
urges them to save these seats for 
the next program—there obviously 
is none on a Tuesday when the 
Theater is only partially filled!
Carnival To Feature 
Forty Name Bands
Students C7 amor 
For Establishment 
Of New Magazine
This year’s Spring Carnival, it has just been announced, 
will be held from April 8 to May 24, and will, of course, ex­
ceed in greatness and glory all carnivals ever held. 
It is obvious by inspection that the dates selected this
4year will preclude all possibility 
of any final exams. Although 
there was some disappointment 
among the students because of 
this, the administration succeed­
ed in railroading through Stupid 
Congress the vote to dispense 
with the exams.
The plans for Carnival itself 
are stupendous, to use an old- 
fashioned word. Forty of the best 
bands and orchestras in the world 
have been engaged for the occa­
sion. The real surprise, however, 
is that instead of each one play­
ing only one night, as might be 
expected, there will be a rota­
tion system of four an evening. 
Orchestras 
The orchestras will be located 
in the gymnasium, Thistle Hall, 
Skibo, and the new five-hundred- 
square-foot ballroom which will 
be completed by next week on the 
site of Margaret Morrison. Stu­
dents are invited to attend as 
many of the dances as possible.
Among the events scheduled 
for the day are the jet-propeljed 
flying-wing race, the aqua ballet, 
and a special three-hour trip 
around the world. The first of 
these, the jet-propelled flying- 
wing race, will start on the west 
coast and terminate with a dive 
into the upper part of Industries 
Hall, commonly known as Admin­
istration Hall.
Ballet
The aqua ballet will take place 
every five minutes on the hour 
in the swimming pool which will 
be constructed in Fine Arts 
Lawn. The company consists of 
sixty-three beautiful mermaids 
who have just arrived from Ma­
rine Gardens. Since the trip 
[Continued on Page 2]
A group of interested students 
on campus have petitioned the 
administration for permission to 
start a humor magazine here at 
Tech.
It was pointed out that most 
other schools our size, and even 
smaller, have student-staffed cam­
pus wit publications, while we 
have none at all. This journalistic 
lacking was felt to be unnecessary 
and unbefitting the Carnegie Plan.
John Smurd, well known cam­
pus pei’sonality, and leader of this 
student group, recently stated, 
“This campus hase gone too long 
without a humor magazine, and it 
is really a shame that we have 
none. Certainly there are stu­
dents on our campus capable of 
producing wit and humor on a 
par with the Harvard Lampoon, 
the Ohio State Sundial, and the 
Yale Record.”
Plight of Scott Issue
Attempts have been made in 
the past to have a humor maga­
zine here, but they have all been 
miserable failures, the most re­
cent being the Scottisue. which 
ceased amusing Tech students in 
1949. Excerpts from the old Scot- 
tissue, published by some un­
known syndicate, reappear peri­
odically on campus, bu they at­
tract little or no attention.
If this plan materializes, the 
first issue will be scheduled for 
| release at Spring Carnival. In or- 
j der that we can get some indica­
tion of the student opinion. We 
j would like to hear your ideas, 
comments and suggestions on the 
project.
Student Backing
A humor magazine, to be suc- 
| cessful, must have the backing 
j of the majority of the student 
! body, and it can be a wonderful 
| addition to the school’s activities. 
. Most of all, it can be a lot of fun
I to write, produce, and read.

to fret. Consolation prizes of

Van Bran Lecture 
Affects THE Plan
It has been noticed by the Natrat that since Dr. Warmer 
Van Bran spoke at Tech last semester there has been a noted 
change in the teaching philosophy prevalent at this school.
The large number of loyal Tech students who faithfully
attend all of the various lecture*----------------------------------------------------
series programs will remember
that Dr. Van Bran was the direc­
tor of Project Xi, the only project 
which given the Air Force ad­
mitted was an utter failure. The 
subject of his lecture was two­
fold: he talked about the great 
project which failed so miserably 
and about some of the technical 
problems so obviously not solved, 
and he talked of his education and 
of what he believed an engineer­
ing student should learn in col­
lege.
Education
His college education was based 
upon memorization of formulas 
and conversion constants and not 
upon basic knowledge as ours is; 
he attributed his great success to 
the fact that he memorized “Ten” 
formulas ana conversion factors 
every day during his college ca­
reer. He said that engineers 
should not only have this educa­
tional background but should also 
be well versed in definitions and 
such other miscellaneous data, as 
10,000 organic structural formulas.
Basic Philosophy
The basic teaching philosophies 
have not yet been changed by Dr. 
Van Bran’s ideas: the basic school 
policy of using three books for 
each course, the first for the stu­
dents, the second to teach the 
course from, and the third for 
exam material, has not been 
changed. However, courses appear 
to be tending toward Dr. Van 
Bran’s ideal; in fact, they had a 
good start before in certain ele­
mentary physics courses, for ex- 
emple.
Teachers have taken to this idea 
since it requires less time to 
grade exams, and students inter­
viewed like it because it makes 
exams easier—all material is re­
membered by rote or note. The 
Natrat is resounding Huzzah!
Natrat
Attention All Students!
Mechanical Engineering stu­
dent Silas P. Wentworth reports 
having lost a one thousand dol­
lar bill in the vicinity of Tech 
Bowl. He says it was the night 
before workmen began filling in 
the bowl. Anyone knowing the 
whereabouts of this bit of lost 
property is asked to contact Mr. 
Wentworth through campus mail. 
Mr. Wentworth says it is impor­
tant that he recovers it, as he 
may be thrown out of his room 
unless his rent is paid by the end 
of this month.
The Natrat staff recently con­
ducted a poll asking students’ 
opinions of Tech’s new develop­
ment plan. Here are some of the 
answers we received:—“I think 
it’s a horrible idea! Why can’t 
people leave well enough alone?”
—“New buildings all over the 
place! Why, we won’t be able to 
find our way around without a 
road map. Things are tough 
enough now.”
—One Fine Arts student com­
plained, “The noise of those hor­
rible machines is driving me 
crazy! I can’t hear myself think, 
let alone sing. And the worst 
part of it is, not one of the ma­
chines is on pitch! How madden­
ing!”
-—A senior architect says he 
doesn’t like some of the plans, 
and suggests that they be altered 
to fit some of his own specifica­
tions.
—A few Margaret Morrison 
girls were beginning to wonder 
why the huge hole next to the 
school was being dug. They were 
advised to get good grades from 
now on, or they might soon find 
out what its purpose was.
Sorority Space 
In Netv Union 
Finally Solved
Plans for the construction of the 
new Student Union provide an in­
teresting discussion of the space 
available for sororities.
The major purpose of the de­
signers is to promote a feeling of 
togetherness among the seven 
groups. This is exemplified by 
their motto, “Sorority, Unity, 
Scarcity (of space).” There are 
thousands of square inches pro­
vided for meetings and sorority 
functions.
To eliminate the possibility of 
cramped conditions stemming 
from separate meeting rooms, all 
sorority meetings could be held in 
one large room. This would, of 
course, result in mass confusion, 
but togetherness would be ever­
present.
The results of this unified ap­
proach present an unlimited scope 
of future group activities. Im­
agine, for example, one hour-long 
Varsity Varieties skit. Members 
of all sororities would take part, 
and the headache of competition 
would be eliminated. The animos­
ity which results from losing a bet 
on the winners of Varsity Varieties 
would no longer exist.
Yes, construction of the Student 
Union can make Carnegie Tech the 
campus of togetherness.

Registrar Announces 
Newest Tech Courses
Carnegie Tech has always strived to present to the world 
the well-rounded engineer. To further the engineer to well­
roundedness Francis M. Towel, the notable figure affiliated 
with the men’s locker room, will instruct a course in the arts
and sciences of towel vending. ?-------------------------------------------------—
As many may not know Mr.
Towel is president ofthe Penn­
sylvania Towel-Vending Associa­
tion, national secretary of the 
Towel-Vending Union Interna­
tional, and has written various 
treatises on the subject.
This science offers to engineers 
a sideline for extra money. In 
locker rooms over the nation one 
can hear the plaintive cry of the 
athlete, “Give me a towel.” What 
better way to help humanity 
(especially to make money) 
than to offer tius service of towel-
ence. Mr. Boyer’s interest in this 
subject was ignited last semester 
when his Thursday, 10:30 swim 
class assisted him into the pool 
(It seems that he has an innate 
fear of water and can’t stand cold 
liquids.)
After his immersion Mr. 
Boyer noticed some reeds lying 
on the bottom of the pool. Fas­
cinated, he picked them up and 
started fashioning a basket for 
his mother. Mr. Boyer became so

Earthmoving
The civil engineers have shown 
an anvid interest in the work be­
ing done by those big machines 
on the Cut which are furthering 
Tech’s building program. This in­
terest has led the civil engineering 
department to offer a new senior 
elective, Earthmoving I and II. 
This course will be under the very 
able direction of Professor Elwood 
Earthclod, famed to be the only 
man to move 300,000 tons of earth, 
gravel, and assorted trash single- 
handed.
The painting and design de­
partment, noticing the great 
amount of creative work being 
done in the abstract field, has 
added a new course to their cur­
riculum. It is Paint Spattering I 
and II. This course requires the 
prerequisite, Paint Mixing I and 
II. The new course will be taught 
by Professor Osgood Smearmuch. 
His works in this field can be seen 
in such well-known art centers as 
Bulawayo, Southern Rhodesia;

India.

Pitt’s Chancellor 
Announces Plan 
To Purchase Tech
Chancellor J. Alfred Stitch- 
meadow announced today that Pit 
is negotiating with CIT officials to 
purchase CIT as a part of its ex­
pansion program.
(It will be remembered by all 
Techites that Pit has, over the 
past several years, bought many 
Oakland area edifices, among 
them the Schenley Hotel and 
apartments, the Schenley Thea­
tre, Forbes Field, and many oth­
ers, the identity of which has not 
yet been revealed.
In addition, a high-ranking Pit 
man hinted in a recent interview 
that Pit envisions the purchase 
of the U Club (commonly known 
to Pittsburghers as the Univer­
sity Club), the PAA, Kauphman’s, 
and the Pittsburgh Tilton.)
Plans For Tech 
Plans for the annexation of 
Tech have been on the board for 
approximately five days, ever 
since Pit discovered that its bas- 
ketweaving II students and Fresh­
water Biology majors have no fa­
cilities for experiments.
According to Chancellor Stitch- 
meadow, Pit will convert all CIT 
campus buildings to laboratories 
or recreation centers. The long 
slanted corridor of AH will serve 
as housingfor long strands of 
bamboo and grass, which senior 
basketweavers will use for their 
final projects.
Machinery Hall 
“Machinery Hall is a perfect 
place,” said the Chancellor, “for 
a small museum depicting the de­
velopment of Egyptian embalming 
fluid. Our medical students will 
find Machinery Hall conveniently 
isolated, so that they may private­
ly perform their mummifying ex­
periments. The furnace in the 
building will be useful as a means 
of eliminating our students’ mis­
takes.”
Chancellor Stltchmeadow said 
that E&S and Margaret Morrison 
will be provided with large glass 
aquariums to be used by Pit’s 
fresh-water biologists. E&S will 
house amoebae, red-headed water 
bugs, crickets, short-legged water 
spiders, lady bugs, flatworms, and 
bar flies, while Margaret Morri­
son will accommodate bullfish, 
angelfish, goldfish, silverfish, star­
fish, dogfish, and the beast from 
20,000 fathoms.
The plans tor the Fine Arts 
building have not been revealed. 
It is rumored, however, that Pit 
will use the music, painting, and 
theatre facilities as outlets for 
basically insecure English ma­
jors.

that the two spurving bearings

conductor being connected by a 
non-revcrsable tremine pipe to 
the differential girdlespring on 
the “up” end of the grammeters.
Grouting Brushes
Forty-one manestatically spaced 
grouting brushes were arranged 
to feed into te rotor slip-stream 
a mixture of high S-value phynyl- 
hydrobenzamine and five per cent 
r e m i n ative tetryliodohexamine. 
Both of these liquids have specific 
pericosities given by P= 2.5 c. n. 
6.7 wherein is the diathetical evo- 
lute of retrograde temperature 
phase disposition and c is chol- 
mondeley’s annular grillage co­
efficient.
Initially, n was measured with 
the aid of a metapolar reflective 
polfrometer (for a description of 
this ingenious instrument, see L. 
E. Rumpelverstein in “Zeitschrift 
fur ElektrotechnistatischsDonner- 
blitze” Vol. VII, but to the present 
date nothing has been found to 
equal the transcendental hopper
logical Sciences,” June, 1914).
Wennelsbroeket
Electrical engineers will appre­
ciate the difficulty of nubing to­
gether a regurgitative purwell and 
a superamitive wennelsprocket. 
Indf^ed, this proved to be a stumb­
ling block to further development 
until, in 1942, it wa; found that 
the use of anhydrous nagling pins 
enabled a kryptonastic boiling 
shim to the tankered.
The early attempts to construct 
a sufficiently robust spiral decom­
mutator failed largely because 
of a lack of appreciation of the 
large quasi-piestic stresses in the 
gremlin studs; the latter were 
specifically designed to hold the 
roffit bars to the spamshaft. When, 
however, it was discovered that 
wending could be prevented by 
a simple addition to the living 
sockets, almost perfect 'running 
was assured.
Operation
The operating point was main­
tained as near as possible to the 
H. F. rem peak by constantly 
fromanging the bitumogenous 
spandrels. This is a distinct ad­
vantage over the standard nivel- 
sheave in that no dramcock oil 
is required after the phase de­
tractors have remissed.
Undoubtedly the turbo-encabu- 
lator has now reached a very high 
level of technical development. It 
has been successfully used for 
operating nofer trunnions. In ad- 
oition, whenever a barescent skor 
motion is required, it may be em­
ployed in conjunction with a 
drawn reciprocating dingle arm 
to reduce simusoidal deplinera- 
tion.

THINKLISHTech Campus 
Founds AFYM
A new social organization 
has recently been organized 
on the Tech campus. Popular- 
% known as the AFYM 
(American F a c i s t Youth 
Movement), it will open its 
1959 season of activities by 
holding a monstrous book 
burning next Monday.
The book burning will be 
held on the Fine Arts lawn 
between the hours of 9 and 
% midnight. All interested 
students and faculty members 
are invited to attend this gala 
event. Refreshments will be 
served afterwards, however 
each person attending must 
bring at least three books; 
one of each of the following 
types; a textbook, American 
(jjistory, and a scientific jour­
nal.
The highlight of the eve­
ning will be the firewalking 
demonstration, to be present­
ed by Dr. C. J. Warmer and 
his staff. This demonstration 
will take place when the 
blaze reaches its peak, prob- 
(Jkly at about 10:30 p.m.
Be sure to support this all 
school event, sponsored by the 
AFYM. The faculty advisor 
of the AFYM is Dr. G. Kay 
Browning, who has been ac­
tive in the AFYM nationally 
for many years.

Prominent Campus Leader 
Reveals Innermost Secrets
With the emphasis on being a “campus leadite” at Tech growing immeasureably in 
the past few years, it would seem to the advantage of every Techite to understand the basic 
principles of how to be a campus leader, thus insuring his success in later life. g
The editors of the Natrat have been compiling research in this field of study over 
the past two months, for their book You, Too Can Lead the Campus, which will be on all
bookstands after June 9.
Although the book has not yet been completed,
subject material from Chapter 22,* 
which deals with the importance 
of finding a campus leadite and 
initiating him until the aspirant 
feels competent enough to assume 
the full responsibilities of leader­
ship himself.
Since the authors feel that the 
routine of the campus leadite is 
all-important, they re-print a 
typical day in the life of a typical 
campus leadite, which if closely 
adhered, will lead to success of 
any leadite hopeful. The follow­
ing is a short summary of Chap­
ter 22.

ADVENTURES IN SOCIAL SCIENCE: NO. 2
Today, with earnestness and sobriety, we make the second of 
our forays into social science. We take up the most basic of all 
social sciences—sociology itself.
Sociology teaches us that man is a social animal. It is not 
instinct or heredity that determines his conduct ; it is environ­
ment. This fact is vividly borne out when you consider the case 
of Julio Sigafoos.
Julio, abandoned as an infant in a dark wood near Cleveland, 
was adopted by a pack of wild dogs and reared as one of their 
own. When Julio was found by a hunter at the age of twelve, 
the poor child was more canine than human. He ran on all 
fours, barked and growled, ate raw meat, lapped water with his 
tongue, and could neither speak nor understand one single word. 
In short, he was a complete product of his environment.
Julio, incidentally, was more fortunate than most wild chil­
dren. They never become truly humanized, but Julio was ex­
ceptional. Bit by bit, he began to talk and walk and eat and 
drink as people do. His long-dormant mental processes, when 
awakened at last, turned out to be fantastically acute. He was 
so bright that he learned to read and write in a month, got 
through grammar school in three years, and high school in two. 
And last June as thousands of spectators, knowing the odds 
Julio had overcome, stood and raised cheer after cheer, he was 
graduated valedictorian from Cal Tech with a degree in astro­
physics !
Who can say to what towering heights this incredible boy 
would have risen had he not been killed the day after commence­
ment while chasing a car?
But I digress. To return to sociology, people tend to gather 
in groups—a tendency that began, as we all know, with the 
introduction of Marlboro Cigarettes. What an aid to sociability 
they are! How benignly one looks upon one’s fellows after puff­
ing on Marlboro’s filter that really filters, on Marlboro’s flavor 
that’s really flavorful. How eager it makes one to extend the 
hand of friendship! How grateful we all are to Marlboro for 
making possible this togetherness! How good not to live in the 
bleak pre-Marlboro world with every man a stranger!
The groups that people live in today (thanks to Marlboro) 
vary widely in their customs. What is perfectly acceptable in 
one society may be quite outlandish in another. Take, for in­
stance, the case of Ug Van Wyck.
Ug, a Polynesian lad, grew up in an idyllic South Sea isle 
where the leading event of the year was the feast of Max, the 
sun god. A quaint all-day ceremony was held, with tribal 
dancing, war chants, fat-lady races, pie-eating contests, and, for 
the grand finale, the sacrifice of two dozen maidens.
According to Ug’s folkways, sacrificing maidens was entirely 
acceptable, but when, in his eighteenth year, he was sent as an 
exchange student to the University of Wisconsin, he soon 
learned that Americans take a dim view of this practice—in 
Wisconsin, at any rate. The first fifteen or twenty maidens Ug 
sacrificed, he was let off with a warning. When, however, he 
persisted, drastic measures were taken: he was depledged by 
his fraternity. A broken man, Ug quit school and moved to 
Milwaukee where today he earns a meager living as a stein.

this square sparrow elimination 
was little Auglielmo’s own Beta 
Theta Omega fraternity.
The BTO intramural team, pac­
ed by Sihugo Sigafoos, who tallied 
28 points, defeated the University 
of Wriggletto in last night’s 
semifinal. Tonight Gulielmoses’
BTO team will attempt to bring 
back to Tech the greatly coveted 
Tiddley Cup after having been in 
Pitt’s possession for fifteen years.
Early Lead 
Sihugo gave the Tartans an 
early lead by tipping three in the 
high scoring five point cup. This 
cup is surrounded by four one 
point cups. Coasting on this lead 
the Scotties matched the Pan­
thers of Pitt point for point; how­
ever the University of Kragleto 
led by all-district Ricardo Criketts 
(just what district is not known) 
gave BTO quite a scare.
I <‘f Coach Kratz
With an amazing display of 
finger dexterity, the CIT team 
out-thought, out-maneuvered, and 
out-cheated their opponents.
Words of wisdom from their 
Coach, F. M. Kratz, during the 
heat of the match enabled Sihugo 
to tip in four in the high scoring 
five point cup early in the game 
to defeat the four from Kragleto, 
who were having trouble with a 
Ofth in their midst.
The joy of winning and the ex­
uberance of the atmosphere filled 
the Tartan tiddley-winksters with 
a true scotch spirit.
Tiddley Cup 
The stage is now set for CIT’s 
attempt on the Tiddley Cup, 
which will be held ~ tomorrow 
night. “Fat” Melvin, the book of 
the block is not to be confused 
\vith the book of the months, says 
^bookbinders favor the Tech Plaid 
tiddley-sinksters to defeat the 
boys from Pittxanski University 
who will be playing the role of 
the spoiler.
This they may well do for the
leaving was “that I can’t stand the 
tension, the constant grind of 
practice sessions and playing 
night after night, not for fun but 
to win. It isn’t a game any more, 
it has become a matter of life and 
death.” Adolph Kratz could not 
be reached for a statement in the 
matter.
in the International Scrabble 
Match at Wimbledon.
With an amazing display of 
brain power and finger dexterity, 
the CIT team out-thought, out- 
maneuvered, and out- cheated 
their opponents, lead by their cap­
tain “Forty-Point“ Sterling, and 
a transfer student, “Azimuth” Al­
gernon Ancelle. Words of wisdom 
from their coach, DennistoWn 
Wood Ver Nincomppop, during 
the heat of the match, enabled 
“Forty-Point” to “zyme” on a 
double letter, triple word, and 
quadruple turn for a match high 
of 93 points, at which point Azi­
muth then “zylemed” out with 68 
points, to defeat the four from 
Kriggletto, who were having 
trouble with a fifth in their 
midst.
Crowd Yawns
The crowd at Forbes on the out­
house, awed by this display, rose
to their feet as one and yawned 
the winning team, who were bus­
ily letting the air out of their 
knee pads.
The stage is now set for CIT’s 
attempt for their sixty-third 
straight title, which will be held 
tomorrow nite. “Fat” Melvin, the 
book of the block, which is not 
to be confused with the book of 
the month, says bookbinders favor 
the Tech Plaid Scrabbleers 1400- 
12y2.to defeat the boys from Pitt- 
zanski University, led by their 
able captain “Finger” Fillip Phew, 
who will try to help P.U. in play­
ing the role of a spoiler. This they 
may well do.
The latest news flash across the 
ticker tape is that “Forty-Point” 
Sterling has been disqualified on 
the grounds that he had been 
using a loaded dictionary. The 
charges were brought up by 
Huckster Davis and are currently 
being refuted by Fullerbrush 
Redusky.
Strong Fingers 
Sought For Tech's 
HVew Yo-Yo Team
All those interested in partici­
pating on the yo-yo team report 
to coach Kant. If all the Natrat 
readers have been faithfully fol­
lowing their daily reporter they 
will know that coach Kant was 
just appointed to add some new 
life and to revamp the yo-yo team.
Immanuel Kant, who is well 
known for his categorical yo-yo 
with its emperative variation, is 
noping for a big turnout. “Manny” 
is particularly interested in walk­
ers, for he believes this will help 
the individual to round out his 
philosophy while exercising his in- 
•dex finger; and everybody should 
have a well exercised index finger. 
Of course practice will be restrict­
ed to the usual four month period. 
The training will consist of stewed 
watercress and chestnuts.

two mighty good reasons why I think you’ll go for ’em. They’re truly low in

LOW TAR: IiM’s patented filtering process adds extra filter fibers electrostati­

read all bulletin t>oards (even if 
they don’t concern you, you will 
be well-informed of everything 
going on on campus), wave and 
smile benevolently at £ll of your 
fans, and emit a happy “good 
morning” to everyone you see 
whether you know them all of 
not (this makes that Little Man 
on Campus feel that you, the Big 
Man on Campus, sympathize with 
his problems and he will undoubt­
edly vote you into every official 
position available.)
8:30 a.m. — coffee in S k i b o 
whether you have a class or not. 
If you are to be a campus leadite 
you must always be available for 
consultation.
To AH
9:00 a.m.—walk casually into 
AH, weaving at the personnal in 
the Admissions and Registrar’s 
Offices—you must have the confi­
dence of people in all walks of 
life at Tech. Toss a cheery “hello” 
into the office of the director of 
SP&W, and drop into the dean of 
students’ and dean of women’s 
offices—in case any problems have 
come up that they might want to 
consult you about. Proceed to the 
public relations office—you must 
be well-informed.
9:30 a.m.—go to class. A cam­
pus leadite must be well-educated 
an't intelligent. Besides, if you 
have any leadite business, you can 
conduct it in class. Always be 
sure to pick a back-row seat be­
hind the fattest person in the 
class.
10:30 a.m.—class.
11:30 a.m.—class.
Lunch
12:30 a.m.—lunch. Walk casu­
ally across the Cut, picking up all 
scraps of information w’hich might 
b useful to you.
Afternoon—class. When last 
class is over, go directly to Skibo. 
Make your presence felt—stand at 
the door for several minutes until 
everyone knows you’re there. 
Don’t sit at the same table for 
more than five minutes. Circulate, 
so that everyone can talk with 
you.
4:30—meeting time. You may
have conflicting meetings. If so. 
get to everyone of them for at 
least seven minutes. Be sure to 
make two or more definite state­
ments about the suDject under 
discussion so that other members 
will cemember that you were there 
and w'ill think that you are inter­
ested. Tell them you have to go 
to four other meetings—they’ll be 
impressed.
Dinner
6:00 p.m.—dinner. Use this time
to sound out new ideas with your 
friends and constituents and to de­
termine, their feelings toward 
pressing campus issues.
Evening—use this time to your 
advantage. Always remember that 
you are a campus leadite and must 
conduct yourself in a manner be­
coming to all campus leadites. Get 
a good night’s sleep—you’ve a 
busy day ahead.

Here’s The Latest 
In Old Hotel Humor
The lengths to which actors and actresses will go to add 
authenticity to their performances are nothing sort of amaz­
ing. One Western star has redone his entire home Texas-style, 
i^nplete with iron triangle on the porch to announce chow. 
A noted Shakesperean actor re-* 
fuses to read contemporary books 
while appearing in n play, lest
their English throw his Eliza­
bethan frame of mind out of kil-
ten
Actress Ann Sothern, preparing 
for a new TV role as an assistant 
hotel manager, has toured the 
country to get the feel of hotel 
'<e, talking to managers, bellhops, 
maids, waiters.
“They’re the most patient peo­
ple in the world,” Miss Sothern 
says, “and deserve a lot more rec­
ognition than they’ve been getting. 
And what a lot of fun they are!” 
In the course of her research, 
Ann has run across a lot of gags 
based on hotel life. But, as she 
says: “A joke is nothing until it 
has audience.” So she graciously 
losses on a dozen of her favorites 
herewith.
Well-Fed Gentleman 
An obviously well-fed gentle­
man ate a fine meal at a posh 
Texas hotel, capped it with some 
rare Napoleon brandy, then raised 
a pudgy finger to the headwaiter. 
All attention, the headwaiter lis­
tened. “I wonder if you remem­
ber,” the man asked, “how I en-à
oyed just such a meal last year
bd, because I couldn’t pay for it, 
you had me thrown out like a 
run-of-the-mill bum?” Flustered, 
the headwaiter said, “I’m terribly 
sorry, sir.” “Perfectly all right,” 
smiled the gentleman, fingering a 
cigar, “but I’m afraid I’ll have to 
trouble you again.”
Anxious to impress his friend, 
the Los Angeles real estate man 
boasted, “I just got a penthouse 
for my wife.”
1% “Good deal!” exclaimed his pal, 
«—where can I make a trade like 
that?”
The American couple had de­
cided to see something of the 
world. One of the stops in their 
journey was a small inn in rural 
France. To facilitate their move­
ments, the husband sent their bags 
ahead. When they arrived, the 
manager—proud of the fev. Eng- 
, hsh words he knew—showed them 
^™iat he had already registered 
them, taking their names fsom the 
luggage. Sure enough, in a fine 
Spencerian hand, there they were: 
•‘Mr. and Mrs. Genuine Cowhide.” 
Shapely Blonde 
It happened in a Tulsa hotel. A 
shapely blonde, slinking her way 
through thè lobby, ignored all the 
admiring stares until she encoun­
tered the town’s Number One oil 
driller. Suddenly, she was all 
1 Ismiles. “How much did you say 
yoor name was?” she inquired 
coyly.
Sign in an old Pittsburgh hotel: 
“Notify us if you see a mouse in 
your room. We’ll send up the cat.
The secretary had pinched pen­
nies for three years just to be 
able to afford the luxury of spend­
ing two weeks at a plush New 
England ski lodge. First morning 
tìiere, she complained to the man­
ager that twice during the night 
she had to dress and go to the 
lobby for some water. “But why 
didn’t you simply press the buz­
zer?” he asked. “The buzzer!” she 
cried. “The bellboy told me that 
was the fire alarm!”
There is a Miami hotel that’s so 
exclusive, rumor has it, that guests 
have to pretend to be hired help.
This is your last chance for 
salvation. You insist on read­
ing this when you know you 
shouldn’t be. Ask your room­
mate for directions to the Bu­
reau of Measurements and 
Guidance, you need help bad!
Out of Order
The salesman remembered see­
ing the same sign over the door a 
year ago: “Out or Order.”
“Don’t you ever fix the ele­
vator?” he asked.
“Shucks,” replied the hotel 
clerk, “we don’t have n« elevator. 
But it lands a high tone to the 
place, don’t you think?”
A mountaineer, visiting the big 
city for the first time, made his 
way through the lobby of a deep­
ly-carpeted hotel. As he was 
struggling with the pen over the 
register, the room clerk notided 
that the new guest had left a trail 
of mud across the room. “You 
might at least wipe the mud off 
your shoes before entering a lne 
hotel,” he remarked icily. The 
mountaineer, finishing his “X,” 
looked up with amazement. “Whut 
shoes?” he asked.
Another backwoodsman, admir­
ing the wonders of a swank hotel 
lobby, was particularly intrigued 
by the elevators. He watched as 
a little old lady stepped into one 
ar\' disappeared behind the slid­
ing door. Seconds later, the ele­
vator returned and out stepped a 
stunning redhead.
“Golly,” he marveled. “I should 
have brought my wife after all.” 
Palm Springs 
A recent visitor to Palm Springs, 
California’s answer to the Riviera, 
reports, “Not everybody you see 
at the lavish hotels there is a mil­
lionaire,” but adds, “Of course, 
they were when they arrived.
And what should any collection 
of gags be without at least one 
shaggy dog story?
A man who had been staying at 
the same hotel every winter for 
30 years was amazed to find a 
horse tending the desk—answer­
ing phone calls, summoning bell­
boys, opening letters.
In stunned disbelief, the man 
asked, “Are you the manager?” 
“Yessir,” the horse answered. 
“May I ask why you’re staring?” 
“Oh, nothing,’ said the man, 
“—I just never thought the cow 
would quit.’
The man who has a yen to mind 
other people’s business should be­
come an efficiency expert and get 
paid for it.

New Men’s 
Dorm To Be 
Built Soon
High on the priority list of the
C.I.T. building program is a new 
men’s dorm, with a Capcity of 
171 men. 
s,This dorm will be built on the 
opposite Donner Hall behind 
Boss and McGill halls. It will 
replace the present Miller and 
Englebricht halls, which have a 
combined capacity of twenty six 
students.
Imaginative Design 
This dorm is of the most mod­
ern, imaginative design, its loca- 
>n presented difficult problems 
5r the area upon which it will 
be built is a steep hill. Therefore, 
the dorm will be of the split level 
type; instead of tearing away the 
hill, the dorm will "climb” the 
hill. The first level of living quar­
ters will be raised above ground 
level for about one-half its length 
by pillars, the area under it serv- 
as a patio.
le dorm will consist of two 
twin sections connected in the 
middle on the first floor by a large 
35x40 ft. recreation room. A spir­
al staircase of this rec room, 
which will be equipped for large 
parties as well as table tennis, 
etc. The second floor will open 
onto a sun deck which will lie 
top of the rec room, while the 
lrd floors will be separated. A
landscaped area will be to the 
rear of the dorm. Between the two 
sections; there will be direct ac­
cess from this area to the sun 
porch.
Built-in Furniture
The rooms will be staggered 
along the outside of the building, 
insuring two exposures to all 
moms. The rooms will be equip- 
P*5l with large closets and built- 
in furniture. The materials used 
in the rooms will be similar to 
those used in Donner Hall. Auto­
matic laundry apparatus, as well 
as kitchenettes and" vending ma­
chines, will be supplied.
The building, which will be 
built of reinforced concrete, brick, 
and glass will be shown off to its 
best advantage, for the area be­
tween Boss and McGill halls will 
^leveled off to a gradual slope 
up to the new facility. The dorm 
is being designed by Celli and 
Flynn, two Tech graduates'.
Pressing Need 
The need for the dorm has be­
come pressing because of the 
rapid increase in the percentage 
of men from out of town; this 
percentage is increasing rapidly 
and is expected to maintain at 
least its present rate. Construction 
^ITexpected to begin this June, 
®nd the unit will be ready for oc­
cupancy in September of 1960.
