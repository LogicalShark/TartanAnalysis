Tickets for Beaux Arts Ball 
Available Only Until April Fifth
Ticket sales for the Beaux Arts 
Ball are closing on April 5. This 
is the last day that tickets can be 
purchased; so don’t say we didn’t 
warn you. Music for this artistic 
extravaganza will be provided by 
Maurice Spitalny’s Orchestra, and 
entertainment will be supplied by 
the departments of the Arts 
School. Each department is slated 
to present a surrealistic interpre­
tation of the place which it holds 
in the field of the Arts—said skit 
to last approximately ten minutes.
The theme of surrealism will be 
appropriate for the resumption of 
this eight-year-dormant affair. A 
great deal of stress is being placed 
upon the decorations of the first 
floor of the Arts building — the 
foyer and the main north-south 
hallway. The orchestra will be 
placed near the middle of this 
long hallway. To help give an idea 
of the costumes that will be in at­
tendance, there will be a Fine 
Arts assembly in the near future 
at which time six or eight of the 
girls will model their dream chil­
dren in the flesh — or is it the 
well-developed personality? What 
about the boys? Well, Adam used 
a fig leaf, so these modern guys 
should be able to shift for them­
selves. And, believe it or not, Os­
cars are being presented to those 
judged to have the most outstand­
ing costumes.
Several nationally-known mag­
azines have been contacted for the 
publicity which should attend the

Civil Engineers 
Hear Speaker
Mrs. C. F. Goodrich will address 
the student chapter of the A.S.C.E. 
on Thursday, March 28, at 4:30 
P. M. in Room 60, Engineering 
Hall. The title of his address will 
be “The Young Engineer Serves 
Himself by Serving His Profes­
sional Society.”
Mr. Goodrich is the Chief En­
gineer of the American Bridge 
Company and a former president 
of the Pittsburgh Section of the
A. S. C. E. He is also a retired 
director of the National Board of 
Civil Engineers. Mr. Goodrich has 
done pioneer work in Civil Engi­
neering Design and is well known 
in other Civil Engineering work.
The meeting will be open to 
students of all colleges.
Bridge Players 
Have First Clash
On Sunday, March 24, at 6:30, 
thirty-two aspiring maniacs as­
sembled in the Union to try their 
hand at the most well-known 
Carnegie pastime, BRIDGE! Of 
the twenty couples originally 
scheduled to start in the elimina­
tion, only 16 couples appeared at 
the fracas.
From this field of 16, the num­
ber will be pared to four regular 
couples and two alternate couples 
who will compete in the Intercol­
legiate Bridge Tournament.
Details of the matches have 
been forwarded and after this 
match has been tabulated the In­
tercollegiate play will take place. 
The Intercollegiate Bridge Tour­
nament Committee will select the 
regional winners from the state 
of Pennsylvania. The three couples 
selected will receive a trip to New 
York City for the finals April 26 
and 27.
The Sunday play was spirited 
•throughout and at times bordered 
on th^.brillianti.
Four Engineering 
Departments Hold 
Joint Seminar
On Tuesday morning, April 2, 
at 10:30 A. M. the students of four 
engineering departments will hold 
a joint meeting in Room 104 In­
dustries Hall. All those interested, 
regardless of college or class, are 
cordially invited to attend. The 
topic under consideration will be 
“The Function of Electrical, Civil, 
Mechanical, and Management En­
gineering in a Hydroelectric Proj­
ect.”
The discussion will consider the 
common problems involved in the 
building of the Bonneville Dam, 
Oregon, one of the larger dams in 
the country. The meeting will pre­
sent the problems met in the con­
ception, design, and operation of 
this typical hydroelectric plant.
Dr. D. F. Miner, Assistant Di­
rector of the College of Engineer­
ing, will open the meeting with a 
short introduction pointing out the 
necessity for understanding the 
small but significant problems of 
engineering. The meeting itself 
will consist of four papers pre­
sented by junior students of the 
individual departments to be fol­
lowed by a discussion from the 
floor. Those speaking will be Rob­
ert J. Kindi, Civil; Robert T. 
Charters, Mechanical; John M. 
Rowley, Electrical; and William
F. Filsby, Management.
Each speaker will use slides, 
charts, or diagrams in presenting 
his material, and each will pre­
sent problems which best repre­
sent the function of his specialized 
branch of engineering. The prob­
lems considered will be limited to 
those of fourfold mutual interest 
to those attending. Under the ad- 
visorship of Prof. C. W. Muhlen- 
bruch and Mr. D. L. Trautman, the 
speakers have made a particular 
effort to coordinate their presenta­
tions. The result should prove par­
ticularly instructive.
The primary purpose of this 
joint meeting is to make more 
vivid the underlying interdepen­
dence of specialized engineering 
divisions. In almost all modern 
engineering problems many spec­
ialized groups are concerned; in 
such situations no branch can af­
ford to be a law unto itself. No en­
gineering group can be content to 
do its own job alone. To function 
at its best, each group must take 
into account the function of the 
others; in addition to its own 
work; it must at all times con­
sider the effects of its decisions on 
companion groups. A mechanical

Notice
Mr. Schilling of the Veter­
ans Administration will be in 
his office in the Veterans Cen­
ter in Industries Hall on Tues­
days and Wednesdays from 
nine to five, and on Wednes­
day evenings. Veterans with 
any questions regarding edu­
cational benefits, on-the-job 
training or any other phase of 
their work are invited to see 
him during these hours.
Dorm Council 
Plans Dance.
On Saturday, April 6, the 
Men’s Dorm Council will sponsor 
their annual Spring Dance in the 
ballroom of the Hotel Schenley 
between the hours of 9:00 P. M. 
and 1:00 A. M. Contrary to previ­
ous information mistakenly print­
ed in the Tartan, this is an all­
school dance, and it will be abso­
lutely informal. Music will be pro­
vided by Clyde Knight’s orches­
tra. Plans have been made for a 
short entertainment which should 
provide some amusement for all 
who attend. The charge per cou­
ple will run to a total of $1.80, 
and any profits will be delegated 
by the M. D. C. to Student Coun­
cil for a specific use.
Inasmuch as this will be one of 
the new informal dances of the 
year, those people who have been 
objecting to the semi-formality of 
the Tech proms will have their 
chance to swing out in their zoo- 
suits and cat hats. Of course, there 
will be soft light and sweet music 
. to cover the activities of those 
who fancy themselves Skibo 
wolves — or wo Iverines — but 
watch.
Tickets will be on sale in Skibo 
every day between 11:30 A. M. 
and 1:30 P. M., and they may be 
obtained through any member of 
the M. D. C.
Nominations Now Open 
For Student Council
Petitions for nomination for the offices of representative to 
Student Council are due in the Dean’s office by 4:30 P. M. this 
Friday afternoon, March 29. Elections to Council will be held 
in an all-school election Tuesday, April 9, from 11:30 to 2:00 in 
the regular balloting places in each of the three colleges.
Each college will have one voting representative on Coun­
cil for everyone one hundred or --------—__________________________

major fraction thereof full time 
day students enrolled. On this basis 
there will be eleven voting rep­
resentatives from Engineering, five 
from Fine Arts, and four from 
Maggie Murph. There will also be 
one non voting representative at 
large, chosen from any class, in 
Engineering and Fine Arts. Two 
non-voting assistant secretaries 
are to be elected from those who 
will be junior secretaríais next 
fall in Maggie Murph.
Of the eleven members being 
elected from Engineering, the only 
qualification is that the represen­
tative must be a sophomore or 
higher next fall. Of the five rep­
resentatives to be elected from 
Fine Arts, three of those chosen 
must be seniors and two juniors. 
One of the four representatives 
from Maggie Murph will be chosen 
from one of the two present assist­
ant secretaries. In addition, two 
seniors and one junior are to be 
elected.
Any registered, full-time day 
student meeting the above qual­
ifications is eligible to be nomin­
ated. Petitions must bear the nom­
inee’s signature and 25 others from 
his college, and must be submit­
ted to Miss Orr by the time indi­
cated above. Any information 
such as platform and activities 
which the Tartan may wish to 
use, should be submitted at the 
same time.
Next week the Tartan will pub­
lish a list of all offices to be fill­
ed and the students nominated for 
each office.
Scholastic Honorary Awards 
Fellowships for Graduates
Graduate Fellowships, each with 
a stipend of $500 for one year, 
have been established by the Hon­
or Society of Phi Kappa Phi. The 
purpose of the award is to aid 
senior students to enter immedi­
ately into graduate study.
Applications for Phi Kappa Phi 
Graduate Fellowships are accept­
ed at any time. In general, the 
Committee votes in time for an 
award to be used in the next term 
or semester. Applications are 
judged against a composite stand­
ard of awards made since 1935, 
rather than against each other.
Phi Kappa Phi Fellowships
Cwens, Sophomore Honorary. 
Active at Tech for 17 Years
On November 3, 1922, Mrs.
Amos, Dean of Women at Pitt, 
discussed with two sophomore 
women the possibility of organ­
izing a sophomore women’s hon­
orary society. Later, twelve fresh­
men and sophomore girls met with 
Mrs. Amos at a pre-organizational 
meeting. They decided that the 
society would have as its purpose 
the promotion of freshmen schol­
arship and activities, and after 
much discussion chose “Cwens” as 
its name, and the crown and scep­
ter for its emblem. Finally on 
December 14, 1922, the by-laws 
were reported and adopted.
The Eta chapter of the Cwens 
was activated at Tech at the sug­
gestion of Dean of Women Mary 
Watson Green on May 2, 1929. Be­
fore this official recognition, it had
been a local sophomore honorary 
known as Ecleas.
The Tech chapter of Cwens is 
the only one in the country which 
has a uniform for its members. 
The distinctive gray and red out­
fit is worn with pride each year 
by twenty girls who are chosen 
from the freshman class on a basis 
of scholarship and activities. This 
year the Cwens have been active 
on and off the campus. They held 
a party for their “twin sisters,” 
the transfer students, gave a tea 
for the PCW Hood and Tassel and 
the Pitt Cwens, and co-sponsored 
the recent “Shamrock Sham” with 
Scimitars. In the future, they are 
planning to hold several teas for 
freshman girls and manage a 
booth at Spring Carnival.
were awarded to members of the 
Carnegie Chapter for 1939-40, 
1940-41, and 1942-43.
These Fellowships are admin­
istered in accordance with the 
following regulations:
1. The Phi Kappa Phi Fellow­
ships shall be awarded each year 
to undergraduate members of Phi 
Kappa Phi, each of whom wishes 
to enroll as a candidates for an ad­
vance degree in a graduate school 
in some American College or 
University. A student regiftering 
in a professional school such as 
Law or Medicine is not eligible. 
Within these requirements no re­
striction shall be placed upon the 
field of work.
2". The recipients of these Fel­
lowships shall be selected from 
among a list of applicants as pre­
scribed below.
(a) Those eligible to apply for 
one of these Fellowships shall in­
clude members of Phi Kappa Phi 
who, during the year preceding 
the proposed graduate study, were 
elected to membership in the so­
ciety as seniors.
(b) To be eligible for consid­
eration, applicants for these Fel­
lowships shall be filed with 
Jeanne C. Hartman, Industries, on 
blanks prepared for this purpose.
(c) One applicant whom they 
consider the most worthy of re­
ceiving one of these Fellowships 
is selected each year, in a manner 
to be determined by each chapter, 
from among those eligible mem­
bers who have filed applications. 
This application, together with 
such additional evidence in the

Delta Skull is announcing the 
opportunity for consideration of 
points for nominations to the 
men’s all-school honoraries. Forms 
have been made, under the direc­
tion of Karl Weber, and these are 
available in Miss Orr’s office to 
all men on campus who feel they 
are eligible for one of the honor­
aries. The only restriction is that 
you must be between a second se­
mester freshman and a first se­
mester junior in any one of the 
undergraduate school at C. I. T.
Regulations of both Scimitar 
and Delta Skull are available, al­
so in Miss Orr’s office, to help 
guide those interested in evaluat­
ing their points. The deadline for 
presenting these points is April
11, because the names of the men 
called are to be included on the 
Spring Carnival program. It is ab­
solutely necessary that a man turn 
in one of these blanks to be con­
sidered for the honoraries because 
it is felt that, if he has not enough 
interest to do this, he is then not 
sufficiently interested to become 
an active participant in the af­
fairs of these societies.
In order to facilitate the han­
dling of these points, the presi­
dents and leaders of the many 
clubs and societies on campus 
should make every effort to eval­
uate properly the points of the 
members of their organizations. 
This work can be facilitated by 
the use of the list of regulations 
which is available in Miss Orr’s 
office.
Policy Association 
Holds Meeting
The most important public 
meeting of the Foreign Policy As­
sociation season will be held in 
Syria Mosque, Tuesday evening, 
March 26, at 8:15 P. M. The meet­
ing is co-sponsored by radio sta­
tion KQV. The speaker at this 
meeting will be Major George 
Fielding Eliot (internationally 
known military analyst, author, 
radio commentator, and lecturer). 
Major Eliot will speak on “Amer­
ica’s Opportunity and Responsi­
bility in World Affairs.” His visit 
comes at a very appropriate time 
because the critical state of world 
affairs calls for clear headed 
strategic analysis. Students are 
urged to attend this meeting and 
to read Major Eliot’s books: If War 
Comes, The Ramparts We Watch, 
Bombs Bursting in Air, and Hour 
of Triumph.
There is no admission charge, 
and tickets are unnecessary. How­
ever, a section of the lower floor 
of Syria Mosque will be reserved 
for members of interested organ­
izations. Tech students may call 
for such tickets either at the For­
eign Policy Association Office. MA 
3500, Ext. 79, or at radio station 
KQV, AT 6802. It is important 
from the standpoint of radio time 
that the audience be seated and 
the program begin promptly at 
8:15.
This meeting will climax the 
$1,000 Peace Day Contest. Forty- 
four cash awards will be presented

Carnival Court
Elections for the court of the 
Campus Queen will be held this 
Friday, March 29, at the regular 
_ balloting places. From the court of 
seven chosen at this time, a queen 
will be selected later to reign over 
Spring Carnival. The Campus 
Queen will be crowned during 
Spring Carnival on Saturday 
morning, May 4, and will reign 
over all the festivities of this col­
orful weekend.
Balloting will be conducted in 
Administration, Fine Arts, and 
Margaret Morrison Buildings from 
11:30 to 2:00. Any full-time day 
student may vote in his college 
during this time.
Voting will be on a weighted 
preferential ballot. Under this sys­
tem the voter marks his first seven

Dorm Bagpiper 
Will Appear Soon
Assignments have been made, 
and the staff is at work setting up 
the first issue of the newly reviv­
ed “Bagpiper.” Everett “Tut” 
Hoffman, editor-in-chief, has an­
nounced that the first issue will be 
distributed on Wednesday, April 
10. It will consist of four pages 
of news, pictures, and features, 
all pertaining to dorm life. The 
“Bagpiper” will start this year on 
a bimonthly basis and will con­
tinue next year as a weekly pa­
per.
The aim this year is not only 
to revive the paper as a Tech tra­
dition but to make it even better 
than it was in previous years. The 
gratifying response received by 
those in charge of reorganization 
proved that dorm students not 
only want the “Bagpiper” back on 
the campus, but also are willing 
to work to make it a success.
CIT Bureau of Placements 
Helps Job-Hunting Students
Too little has been said about 
the valuable services provided by
C.I.T.’s Employment Bureau. Per­
haps that is because students don’t 
know about the office and its func­
tions or they just take it for grant­
ed. Also, it may be that the Vets, 
who make up such a large part of 
the student body, are content with 
their large (?) government sub- 
sistance allowance and so are not 
interested in gainful employment.
The Bureau of Placements, its 
official title, under the direction 
of Mr. C. E. Wangeman, is located 
in Administration Hall, Room 155. 
It acts as a clearing house for part 
time employment for students and 
helps the graduate or near gradu­
ate obtain a suitable position when 
he finishes his course at Tech. The 
part time phase of the Bureau’s 
activities consists of bringing the 
student desiring part time work 
and employer desiring part time 
employee together. To do this a 
file of cards made out by students 
is kept, which indicate the indi­
vidual’s training for various jobs, 
and the number of hours he has 
available. When a company or in­
dividual requests someone for part 
time work, Mrs. Kreigline, in 
charge of this department, noti­
fies students listed under the par­
ticular type of work wanted, giv­
ing them the name of the prospec­
tive employer to call. Jobs avail­
able range all the way from cut­
ting grass, gardening and watch­
ing children to skilled trades such 
as draftsmen and machinists in 
local factories. A student need not 
have a great deal of free time to 
take advantage of this opportunity 
to supplement his income. He may 
work as few as one or two hours 
a week or as many as he has avail­
able. Veterans, according to the 
school’s Veterans Administration 
Office, need not fear that they will 
jeopardize their subsistence allow­
ance by taking part time work. 
They may work any number of 
hours if it is less than a full work 
week of forty hours and still be 
entitled to the provisions of the 
G. I. Bill.
Another important phase of the 
service performed by the Employ­
ment Office is the placement of 
students in summer jobs such as 
camp counselors and workers in 
mills and factories. The office tries 
as far as possible to refer the stu­
dent to an employer who will 
offer him work in the field in

The holding of a joint meeting 
to consider such inter-relations is 
something entirely new on the 
Carnegie Tech campus and, so far 
as is known, has never been at­
tempted at any other college 
throughout the country. Profes­
sional engineering societies have 
long recognized the need for such 
meetings, but even they have done 
relatively little to face the situa­

do much to broaden the horizons

THE CARNEGIE PLAID
Page Edited by Evening School Students of Carnegie Institute of Technology
Interviewing Dr, Claude R. Schwob New
Personality is the main lesson 
for tonight, ye knowledge-craving 
Techites. Subject number one 
and only with whom we shall ex­
periment and probe into for hid­
den secrets is one Dorothy Papa— 
the personality girl. Of course, we 
all know the definition for this 
admirable trait (not the girl) is 
in this writer’s limited vocabulary 
—“that which makes us either 
this or that.” In other words this 
gal, Dorothy, has lots of this and 
quite a bit of that. The “this” 
pertains to that laughing and ever- 
fun-loving way of hers. The 
“that” refers to her versatile in­
terests. Honest, it ranges from 
teaching piano lessons to taking 
long hikes and bowling a high 50. 
No matter where you see her, she 
is either singing a song or in the
(tyUcttotiA,
After listening to everyone cry­
ing the blues, one can scarcely 
dare to begin a new controversial 
discussion. However if anyone 
was down in town last Thursday, 
he would inevitably have started 
to cuss the smog, the fog, and the 
smoke.
Now you are ready to say, “How 
can a native of Pittsburgh dare 
talk that way of his own home 
town?” But don’t get me wrong. 
Can we afford not to call a spade 
a spade?
Pittsburgh is the “apple of my 
eye, but I certainly do not en­
joy seeing the “apple” so soiled 
by soot and smoke, by dirt and 
grime, and by filth. We have be­
come so accustomed to living in 
dirt and smoke that we are ac­
cepting them as a natural condi­
tion in our lives, bestowed upon 
us by the gods. It behooves us, 
each and every one of us, to pro­
test against this outrageous con­
dition. But to protest is in itself 
not enough. We must be ready 
and willing to accept the respon- 
sibilty for rectifying these perver­
sions of our natural environment. 
To cleanse the air, and by so do­
ing to purge all dirt, is a matter 
of such concern, that we must tol­
erate no further procrastination, 
no more dilatory tactics, in the 
anti-smoke campaign.
The fact that you live here is 
reason enough for protesting. 
Surely, you are sufficiently inter­
ested in the well-being, in the fu­
ture prosperity, of your home 
town to want to improve it. Let’s
process of mastering the words to 
the latest hit song. Wonder if she 
knows the words to “Sho Fly Pie.”
Tech claimed her three years 
ago as a clerk in the Bookstore, but 
today she hails from Major Stan­
ton’s office. Two nights a week 
Spanish is her main concern, 
study, and real worry. You can 
be sure she has her heart in her 
Espanol whenever you hear her 
repeating off those Spanish 
phrases.
Everyone has some secret ambi­
tion, and Dorothy is a very normal 
girl. Her secret ambition has al­
ways been to write a real literary 
masterpiece. Shall we. warn 
Gladys Schmidt of this girl? No, 
Tech’s fame must continue. Keep 
that personality, Dorothy, and you 
can be sure of always winning 
friends and influencing people.
Words of Wisdom
It’s only fair that we warn those 
students who are looking only for 
mediocre science that they shall 
be disappointed; for the following 
mumbo-jumbo comes from a truly 
great mind.
The list of words to describe 
climate, someplaces it’s hot and 
some it’s cold.
The temperature on the surface 
of the earth varies from day to 
day because the sun sometimes 
slants wrong; then it is colder than 
when it slants right. Then it is 
warm.
Weather is the change you can’t 
tell if it is going to rain or be 
cold.
Climate is if you live in the 
south you wouldn’t wear any 
clothes, but in the north you have 
to wear thick clothes.
Temperate is where hot is al­
most cold, and cold is almost hot.
Frigid is where it is very cold.
Torrid is where it is very hot.
Centigrade is graduated air di­
vided into 100 equal parts called 
degrees.
Fahrenheit is graduated air 
founded by a German scientist in 
1714.
Wind is something that moves 
but you can’t see it until it moves 
fast then it upsets houses.
When wind gets wet and falls 
straight down it is called rain.
When rain gets cold and looks 
like iceballs, then it is called sleet.
have the mayor and the county 
commissioner hear from all of you. 
Let’s have action in the anti­
smoke, back to nature campaign. 
You can’t afford NOT to do it!
Asst. Professor of Chemistry
Affair of Year
Like all of the past 30 Engineer’s 
Banquets the thirty-first one (to 
be held in the Roosevelt hotel Sat­
urday, April 27), is shapping up in­
to another sure success. Yes it can’t 
help but be everything the En­
gineers say it will be since ban­
quet chairman Fred Vichich in­
forms us that Max Hannum has 
consented to be toastmaster for the 
affair. Most Tech students know 
Max as former basketball mentor 
and those students who have been 
to the basketball games know 
what an energetic person he is, 
and those who have heard Max’s 
witticism will back me up whole­
heartedly that he’s a cinch to make 
the guests present feel right at 
home.
Fred Vichich wants to remind 
all the Evening Engineering stu­
dents that tickets are now on sale 
and that the price of the ticket is 
$3.00. Tickets may be obtained 
from Mr. McKelway or Frank 
Mihelich. Be sure to obtain yours 
early because they go like hot- 
cakes. THIS REALLY IS THE 
AFFAIR OF THE YEAR.
Spring, and Thoughts 
Lightly Turn to Style
With Easter only a little way off, 
we had better give a few fashion 
hints to the style conscious Cam­
pus Jills and Joes.
First and foremost is the young 
lady’s hat, or to be more styl- 
wise, chapeaux. In order to com­
bine practicality with beauty, we 
suggest the ex-G.I. brother’s hel­
met complete with camouflage 
netting into which has been fetch- 
ingly thrust new spring onions,, 
cardinal feathers, and blue bird 
eggs. (We suggest the eggs be 
hardboiled.)
Another interesting creation re­
cently displayed was a rare butter 
carton, opened at one end to re­
veal a false cube of butter. This 
bit of femininity is perched over 
one eye with pierced Kleenex. 
Also another charming creation 
witnessed on the Fifth Avenue, 
one sure to get fashion’s little 
Oscar, was a gob’s cap with a 
coonskin band, and crocuses drop­
ped becomingly over one ear, and 
carrying an atom gun as a feature 
decoration.
One of the most attractive out­
fits displayed for the season is a 
pair of sailor blue jeans rolled to 
the knees to disclose a pair of 
nylons (if you’re that lucky) and 
appliqued with horses of different 
colors. For a jacket, we suggest 
a slightly but genuinely used bat­
tle jacket snugly bound with
The students who study chem­
istry on Wednesday and Monday 
evenings will agree with me that 
Dr. Claude R. Schwob, Assistant 
Professor of Chemistry at Tech, 
is a very charming person. His 
friendly manner and pleasing 
smile put everyone at ease.
Dr. Schwob is of French descent, 
He has a warm spot in his heart 
for that country, but is now. as 
American as apple pie. After 
graduating from Fordham Univer­
sity, he was a professor at St. 
Peter’s College in Jersey City. 
From 1943 to 1945, he was with 
the Army Engineers working on 
the Atomic Bomb and saw the ex­
plosion of the first Atomic Bomb 
in New Mexico last summer. It 
was quite an interesting experi­
ence, but a little frightening, he 
confesses. As a result of this 
work he would like to take an 
active part in politics.
Dr. Schwob likes to listen to 
music and read non-fiction stories. 
However, when no heavy reading 
matter can be found, he thorough­
ly enjoys a blood and thunder de­
tective story, and, yes, Dick Tracy 
is his favorite sleuth. He also be­
lieves in “Barnaby’s” fairy god­
father, “Mr. O’Malley” and won­
ders if “Daisy Mae” will ever win 
“Li’l Abner.”
Attend the 
Beaux Arts Ball
No doubt many of the Evening 
Students who faithfully read the 
TARTAN and PLAID have no­
ticed the advertisements for the 
Beaux Arts Honorary Society, an 
organization composed of the out­
standing students in the College 
of Fine Arts.
This is the first Beaux Arts Ball 
to be held since 1938, and its 
theme of surrealism is sure to 
provide an interesting and color­
ful evening. Surrealistic inter­
pretations of the various arts are 
planned by the members of the 
Fine Arts Department participat­
ing in the event. Prizes are to be 
offered for the most original ideas 
in murals, costumes, and skits. 
Maurice Spitalny and his well- 
known orchestra are to provide 
music for the occasion. The ball 
is to be directed by Tom Lakowski 
with Scotty Yurchison handling 
the business, and Marty Moore the 
tickets.
Any Evening Student who de­
sires to attend this costume ball 
should notify his professor, and 
tickets will be sent to the classes 
for distribution. The price is $3.60 
per person, and the ball is stag.
Attention, Veterans
Mr. Schilling, a representa­
tive of the Veterans Adminis­
tration, will be on the cam­
pus one evening a week. He 
will be available on Wednes­
day evenings at the Veterans 
Center, Industries Hall 144-C. 
Veterans who have any ques­
tions concerning educational 
benefits, on-the-job training, 
or subsistence allowance are 
requested to report to Mr. 
Schilling.---------------------------*.----------------------—-

Just got back from eyeing “The 
Bells of St. Marys” and no wonder 
I can’t concentrate. Go see it, if 
you haven’t already beat me to 
the draw. Bing and Bergy are 
really Solid with a capital “S”
. . . But before I brag about my 
idol, I’ll open a can and dish out 
the corn . . . Missed Mr. and Mrs. 
Fountain in class last Friday night. 
They deserted me for Washington, 
D. C. Nobody knows how badly I 
missed them . . . methinks I bet­
ter start doing my own homework. 
In case you didn’t know it, your 
8-Ball editor is very seriously 
thinking of joining the local po­
lice force in their hunt for missing 
persons. There are quite a few 
lads and lassies about whom I 
wonder!! That is to say, “What 
happened to everybody last week?” 
Rosemary accounted for herself by 
reporting her presence at the Barn 
Dance. Hope she had a good 
time ’cause I know she can cut 
a mean quadrille right . . . Your 
corn player strongly recommends 
you make a point of hearing, “The 
Dark Town Poker Club.” Wish 
they’d hurry up and break that 
seal on the new batch of Decca 
Records so we’d know if he ever 
got to use that razor. In case you 
don’t know what I’m talking about, 
I repeat, “Hear the record. You 
have no idea what you’re missing.” 
. . . Welcome back, Cecile. Keep 
coming out for the Plaid. Really 
missed ’ya. Where ya been the 
last two weeks? See? Didn’t I 
tell you I’d make a good sleuther? 
. . . Now I know why Dorothy 
didn’t show up Friday. The rea­
son? He’s tall, dark, and answers, 
well what a coincidence, to her 
telephone exchange, “Emerson.” 
Ahem! Think I’ll trail them some 
night. Does anybody know any 
dirt I can tie up with Frank 
Mihelich? I’m just dying to men­
tion his name in this column. Well, 
what do you know, I just did! . . . 
Heard Kelly is being pursued 
rather forcefully by a P. & D. 
lassie from another class . . .
Well, that winds up the column for 
another week. But I’ll be back.
