POPULARITY VOTE 
TO BE TAKEN TODAY
Six Stunts, Movies, Speeches 
and Refreshments on 
Program
The Science Stag will ne held in 
the Carnegie Union this ¡Saturday 
night at 7:301 Machine politics has 
been evident in the Popularity Contest 
but the secret balloting whcli begins 
today is expected to determine the 
choice of the majority.
Director Mott will open the festivi­
ties at seven-thirty with a short 
speech of welcome and then after a 
few preliminary distributions of 
smokes the Plebes will offer their 
operatic skill with the three other 
classes following in order. Consid­
erable interest is being shown in the 
Senior stunt for the oldest class has 
had an unusual record during its four 
years at Carnegie winning the silver 
trophy two out of three years and to­
day they are openly boasting their 
supremacy.
When the class acts have been 
completed and the schools’ stock of 
“wisecracks” has been replenished 
for another year, Dr. Rittman, head 
of the Commercial Engineering De­
partment will give a short talk in 
keepdng wlith the dramatic master­
pieces which have just been presented 
and to prepare for the alumni and 
faculty stunts to follow. IH’e has as­
sured evedybody that he will de­
termine if “Five out of every four 
are there.
After the professors have furnish­
ed their part of the entertainment, 
it has been decided to show just! how 
,good the Carnegie dramatists are by 
comparing them with prominent scen­
ario stars. This will be accomplish' 
ed by a two reel high class comedy. 
If the pictures of the thrilling events 
of the past football season are avail­
able the spectators will have an op­
portunity to see their heroes repro­
duced on the silver screen.
With solemn setting and awed 
demeanor the Popularity Contest 
awards will then be made. The prizes 
have been carefully chosen so that 
they will typify that branch of noto­
riety in which the recipiclent has 
gained fame. Precedent is not the 
(Continued on Page Two.)
On November 20, there was a for­
mal presentation of photometric equip­
ment to Carnegie by President C. W. 
Ward of the Electric League, in room 
60 of the Science Building.
Professor Hower ot the Physics 
Department accepted the equipment 
with thanks in behalf of the Insti­
tute, and expressed the hope that' 
the members "of the Electric League 
and the Pittsburgh Chapter of the 
Illuminating Engineering Society 
would feel that the room and its fac­
ilities would be at their disposal at 
all time3 provided sufficient notice is 
given beforehand to allow arrange­
ments to be made for moving the 
classes which meet there, to another 
room.
About one hundred persons were 
present at the exhibit and a commit­
tee was appointed of which Mr. Doug­
las Wood of the Allegheny Lamp Div­
ision of the General Electric Com­
pany, was made chairman. The com­
mittee decided to institute a course 
or series of six free lectures, begin­
ning the week of January 4.
The speakers will be prominent 
men from the laboratories of Cleve­
land. Bloomfield, Sthenectady and 
other places where experiments are 
constantly being carried on in the 
field of industrial and commercial 
illumination.
Costume Ecs to Hold 
Bazaar Next Tuesday
Scholarship to be Given From 
Sale Proceeds
The Costume Economics Depart­
ment of the Margaret Morrison Col­
lege will have a Christmas bazaar, 
Tuesday, December 15, the proceeds 
of which will be used for a Costume? 
Economics Scholarship. The Sopho­
more, Junior, and Senior classes In 
Dressmaking and Home Decoration 
have been spending a great deal ot 
time both in class and outside of 
class, preparing for this affair.
Although there was a similar ba­
zaar last year, there will be much 
more variety and a greater selection 
to choose from than before. This will 
afford an excellent opportunity for 
the choosing of Christmas gifts which 
will be most attractive and very mod­
erately priced.
The articles, consisting of handker­
chiefs, fancy table and bed linen, em­
broidered pillow slips, towels, aprons, 
lingerie and other “unspeakabies”, 
dainty boudoir caps and novelties, 
will be put on display at 10:30 a. m. 
in the front hall of Margaret Morri­
son. No reservations will be made 
beforehand, but time will be given for 
looking at the entire exhibit before 
sales begin.
A great deal of work and money is 
being expended on this bazaar and 
since the benefit will be mutual, the 
co-operation of all is desired.
The actual institution of this course 
of free lectures is the result of num­
erous conferences which Professor 
Prine of the Physics Department and 
members of the Electric League and 
the Uluminating Society. Mr. Prine 
feels that such a course of lectures 
will stimulate the interest' of large 
.manufacturing concerns all over the 
country to the value of proper illum­
ination in factories and workshops in 
not only increasing production, but in 
safeguarding the health and eyesight 
of employees. He believes such a 
course will bring to Carnegie many 
plant executives and manufacturers 
from Greater Pittsburgh, and that an 
interchange of ideas and information 
will be mutually beneficial to the fac­
tory owners and to the heads of the 
Engineering Department in the Insti­
tute. In addition, Mr. Prine points 
out, the excellence and variety of 
equipment at Carnegie will be widely 
advertised throughout the industrial 
world. Additional equipment is being 
received from time to time and added 
to the already valuable collection in 
the Engineering Department. Consid­
erable interest is being shown in 
such progress by many leading en­
gineers in the Pittsburgh District, all 
of which may culminate in the ulti­
mate addition of Photometry and Il­
lumination as evening courses.

Christmas Cheer Pervades 
Entire Issue of Magazine 
Largest in History
FEATURE STORY SEC.
The Christmas number of “The 
Shilling” will be placed on sale, Thurs­
day, December 10. Christmas cheer 
pervades the entire magazine, from 
Charlotte Mansfieid’s attractive cover 
to the very last page. This Issue is 
the largest in the history of the maga­
zine, which was very popular last 
month, when four hundred copies were 
sold within five hours.
Florence Cohen has a whimsical 
story in tills issue called “To Those 
Who Wait.” It 13 a tale of a pathetic 
little mountain girl who never had a 
Christmas, nor knew the Christmas 
legend. Alice Moore’s "Sunday Night 
Supper with Ralph,” and Marguarite 
Balph’s “Fifty Dollars Worth” are 
charming.
Eleanor McCann, in a clever essay, 
“Before and After Taking,” discusses 
her reactions to a course In college 
psychology.
There is more poetry in this issue 
than in the previous number this 
year, part of which is in keeping with 
the holiday spirit. Elinore Wilson has 
writen some light, frothy poetry; 
Alice Moore, whose poetry and short 
stories appeared regularly in last year’s 
Shilling, will be represented by a son­
net.
The Book Review Section which was 
initiated In the last issue, is unusu­
ally good. The 1925 Harper Prize 
novel, Anne Parrish’s “The Perennial

CARNEGIE CALENDAR
WILL BE COMPLET­
ED NEXT WEEK
Work on the Carnegie Calen­
dar has brought it to a stage of 
completion, and It will be ready 
for release next week.
This calendar will be most at­
tractive, being bound in leather 
on which is imprinted the Car- 
neqie seal, the year, 1926, and 
best of all the npme of our 
Alma Mater, Carneqie. Things 
of interest to all Carnegie stu­
dents will be found inside, 
worked uo in a manner equally 
as attractive as the cover.
Carneaie has lonq felt the 
need of a school calendar, in 
that it has long been a fixture 
-in schoo's of her standards.
An ideal Christmas gift, an 
incomparable memento of Car­
neaie, and an art'cle that every 
student will feel the need for 
and be proud to own.
GENERAL ASSEMBLY 
IN CARNEGIE MUSIC 
HALL AT 11:30 TODAY
A very attractive program which 
promises to be not too long has been 
propared for the student general as­
sembly to be held in the Carnegie 
Music Hall at 11:30 tills morning. 
There will be several features of gen­
eral interest, which, coupled with an 
excellent assortment of entertainment 
will make the assembly well worth at­
tending.
Several campus honorary organiza­
tions will take part in the program 
and there will be a feature involving 
a faculty member, the details of which 
have been kept secret.
The prize cup for marksmanship 
will also be awarded by the R.O.T.C. 
to the winner of the contest in rifle 
marksmanship. This cup is awarded 
annually and was won this ytear by 
W. D. Campbell, a freshman, who 
made a score of 173 out of a possible 
200.
The entertainment will consist of a 
comedy sketch, an impersonation, and 
a stunt the nature of which has not 
been determined. The black-faced 
comedy sketch will be given by Mc­
Clure and Norbeck,. and, judging by 
former performances of this kind, 
should be a great success. Then there

RELATIVITY THEORY 
TOPIC OF LECTURE
Cornell Professor Will Discuss 
Subject Graphically To­
morrow Night
SPEAKER KNOWN HERE
Vladimir Karapetoff, widely known 
scientist and professor of electrical 
engineering at Cornell University, 
will give a lecture on “Einstein’s Re­
stricted Theory of Relativity”, in the 
Union at 8:30 tomorrow night. The 
lecture will be explained graphically, 
and is open to all who are Interested.
Professor Karr.potoff was born In 
St. Petersburg, Russia, In 1876 and 
educated in the Institute of Ways of 
Communication. He later graduated 
from Technlsche Hochschule in Darm­
stadt, Germany. After graduating’, he 
taught electrical engineering and hy­
draulics in the College of 3t. Peters- 
burgli. From 1897 to 1902 ho was 
consulting engineer for the Russian 
government. At tho end of this time 
he came to the United States and be­
came affiliated with tho Westinghouse 
Electric and Manufacturing Company 
at East Pittsburgh for two years. In 
this position he became well known 
in Pittsburgh.
In 1915 Professor Karapetoff was a 
member of the International Jury ol 
Awards of the Panama Exposition. 
Ho has also beon a member of tho 
Advisory Board of the United States 
Naval Academy. Ho Is a mombor of 
Sigma Xi, the scientific honorary, Eta 
Kappa Nu, the olectrical honorary, 
and Tau Beta Pi, engineering honor 
ary. He joined the faculty of Cornell 
in 1904, where he organized the elec­
trical engineering laboratories. He is 
a recognized authority on electricity 
and is also the adtlior of several text­
books on the subject and numeroub 
articles in engineering magazines, 
and is Research Editor for the “Elec­
trical World”. His textbook is used 
at Carnegie.
In addition to being a scientist or 
(Continued on Page Two.)
On Friday night, at 8:30 p. m. the 
annual Christmas Carnival of the Car­
negie Tech Guild, will begin. Tho fes­
tivities will be carried on in both the 
Union and in Langley Lab, in order 
to accommodate the expected crowds.
The decorations and general theme 
for the Carnival this year will be that 
of an Ice Carnival. And of course no 
Ice Carnival would be complete with­
out skating. But since it is impossible 
to have ice skating, roller skating will 
be substituted in its place. The center 
of Langley Lab will be converted Into 
real, lionest-to-goodness skating 
rink. Here all those who. have a fond­
ness for roller skating may disport 
themselves. The skates will be pro­
vided, and for the benefit of tlioso 
who do not know how to skate, or who 
have lost the knack of it, instructors 
will be present on the rink, to render 
assistance where needed. Thus overy- 
one may enjoy this novel feature of 
the Carnival. The revellers will skate 
to the strains of the Techson’s Orches­
tra.
Small tables will be placed sur­
rounding the Skating Rlnlc, to which 
the skaters and dancers may adjourn 
for light refreshments. Charming 
waitresses will servo- coffee, sand 
wlches, and cakes.
Tho Union will bo the contor of 
dancing for tho evening. Special 
lighting effects aro to bo arranged, 
and the Carneglans will furnish tho 
music. A Christmas, Tree, without

PHILA. COMPANY ANNOUNCES
STUDENT ESSAY CONTEST
The Philadelphia Company announc­
es a contest, the awards of which are 
to consist if three cash prizes, $200, 
$100, and $50. The subject is “How 
can the local Public Utilities best 
help the future development of the 
Pittsburgh District."
The contest is open only to stu­
dents of Carnegie, Pitt, and Duquesne 
U. Manuscripts must be turned in 
by March 31, 1926. Winners will be 
announced June 1. The Philadelphia 
Company will cooperate in the com- 
pletacion of data.
Copies of the full rules governing 
the contest can be secured at Dean 
Tarbell’s office.
At a joint meeting of the Seniors 
and the Senior Dress Committee last 
Friday, plans were definitely made to 
secure distinctive hats as official class 
insignia.
The Senior hats are to be Silver 
Gray in color and will have the class 
numerals “26” done in plaid on the 
front of the hats. The hats somewhat 
resemble the Druid hats in shape and 
are to be exactly the same for all 
schools, there being nothing on them 
to distinguish Arts Seniors from Sci­
ence or Industries Seniors.
These caps will be more valuably 
considering wearing qualities, than 
those procured in the past. It has 
been found impossible to obtain a fea­
ture hat in every day style at a rea­
sonable price, that will outlast more 
than two rainstorms.
There has been some talk about 
canes for the Seniors. The Senior 
Civils have already purchased Scotch 
canes and have decorated them in 
various colors. If any Senior desires 
one of these canes the committee will

“TISSUE ISSUE” OF PUPPET
OUT NEXT TUESDAY
There will appear on the campus 
next Tuesday what la perhaps the 
most novel Issue our novel Puppet has 
ever issued—the “Tissue Issue”. You 
may take that any way you like. De­
tails are being kept secret for the 
present, but suffice it to say that it 
will be repleter than usual with tho 
Carnegie brand of humor, and what 
more can one desire? Furthermore, it 
will be fairly reeking with the spirit 
of Christmas, so as to constitute, as 
ever, an appropriate and seasonable 
gift.
Last week twelve men were pledged 
to Scarab, a national honorary fra­
ternity in architecture.
The Carnegie chapter has thirteen 
active members and has pledged the 
following men: Donald Speiser, Bron­
son Luty, Caleb Hornbostel, Waldo 
Lynch, Benjamin Ade, Russell Bull- 
inger, Alfred Wingold, Arnold Perre- 
ton, Jack High, John Carr and George 
McKinney.
Scarab was the first architectural 
honorary to be installed at Carnegie 
and has chapters at Penn State, Mass­
achusetts Institute of Technology,
Armour Institute of Technology,
Washington University, University of 
Kansas, University of Illinois and 
Carnegie Institute of Technology,
Membership in Scarab is a reward 
for leadership and high scholasti 
standing.
DR. RITTMAN WILL AID IN
AGRICULTURAL RESEARCH
Dr. Walter F. Rittman. head of tho 
Department of Commercial Engineer­
ing of Carnegie Institute of Technol 
ogy, has been appointed consulting 
engineer to the fixed Nitrogen R 
search Laboratory of tho United 
States Department of Agriculture, ac­
cording to an announcement. The 
work will deal with the industrial ap­
plication of nitrogen and fertilizer re

ment of Agriculture.
Pre-Holiday Sale of 
Directories Today
Student directories will be on 
sale today at assembly. This Is 
the second campaign and will 
provide the last opportunity of 
obtaining a Student Directory 
before the holidays. The price 
is forty cents.
The directory offers an excel­
lent reference to those who 
wish to send Christmas cards 
to their friends. There are a 
great many students who did 
not obtain the directory during 
the last sale period, many of 
whom wanted one or have dis­
covered their need of the book­
let since: the sale today will 
supply this demand and it Is 
hoped will dispose of the re­
maining copies of the directory, 
thus assuring the success of the

program being too long and drawn out 
as to become dlslnteresting and tiro-

With tho volume of check cashing 
continually on tho upward trend, tho 
Carnegie branch of the Y. M. C, A. 
has cashed a total of $22,000 in stu­
dent checks during the period from 
the beginning of the semester to the 
present time.
Tho student banking system form­
erly was operated through the cash­
ier's office was discontinued at tho 
end of the first semester last year.
The Carnegie Y assumed charge of
this sorvlco and Instltutod the pros
ont check cashing system. Tho turn­
over of last semester was a total of 
$18,000 Involving an average of 50 
transactions a day.

transactions a day amounting to a 
totpl'-of $3,000'*a week.

WEST- VIRGINIA TO BE PLAYED NEXT FALL 
The most recent addition to the coming season’s football sched­
ule is a contract with West Virginia University for a series of two 
games. One game will be played in Pittsburgh on the Saturday 
before Thanksgiving, the date occupied by St. Louis this year, and 
the other to be staged at Morgantown in 1927. In securing the 
Mountaineers for the Tartans’ opponents on that Saturday, “Buddy” 
Overend has supplied another major contest which, judging from the 
past season, can be easily accommodated. It will also be remem­
bered that Pitt does not schedule games on this date, and as a re­
sult the proposed fray will be the only attraction in the Pittsburgh 
district. West Virginia had an exceptionally strong team this year. 
Victories were scored over such teams as W. & J., Penn State and 
Boston College, and the only game lost was that to Pitt, by one 
touchdown. Carnegie followers have just cause to feel elated over 
this acquisition.

Carnegie’s 1925 football season has 
come and gone. Whether or not it 
was a success will furnish the sub­
ject for many debates thru the long 
winter months. The Tartan’s season 
record was five won, two lost, and 
one tie. This material on hand at 
the opening of the fall training camp 
gave promise of developing into a 
stronger combination than that of last 
year, but it was not until the final 
game of the year, the Lehigh game, 
that the expected strength of the Tar­
tans showed itself. It may have been 
the mid season injuries to several of 
the varsity, or it may have been the 
muddy gridirons, that held back the 
development of the team.
The season opened on the first Sat­
urday in October against Thiel. Soon 
after the opening kickoff Thiel re­
covered a fumble, and scored a touch­
down. This seemed to get the Plaid 
starter. The rest of the game was 
just a series of marches down the 
field to a touchdown. Of course Thiel 
managed to hold the Skibos once in 
a while, forcing them to kick, but 
there was never any doubt as to who 
would be returned the final victor. 
The final result was 27-7.
On the following Saturday Mt. S't. 
Marys furnished the opposition. The 
visitors came here with ¡an enviable 
reputation, and the Tartans sent them 
home with a 34-0 defeat. The Tartans 
looked better in this game and every 
body looked forward to celebrating a 
win over W. & J.
The third game of the season was 
the annual trip to Little Washington. 
The first half was a standstill. The 
field was in a bad shape, but the 
Presidents hadn’t shown themselves 
to be any better mud horses than the 
Tartans. High hopes were held out 
for the things that were to come in 
the next half. Carnegie received, 
made two running plays, and there 
the game ended. Two sections of the 
old wooden stands collapsed. While 
no one was killed, several were seri­
ously injured, and the game had been 
delayed about half an hour. These 
two facts led the officials to call the 
game. A disappointed crowd treked 
their way back to Pittsburgh.
The Tartans next game was the 
little trip across the hollow to the 
den of the Panther. The stadium was 
nice, but the weather man was very 
unkind. It started to rain that morn­
ing, and it was still raining when the 
game was over. Parts of the field 
were ankle deep with mud and water. 
This did not stop Pitt from taking 
the city championship away from us. 
The game was frequented by fumbles 
on both sides, but the one Carnegie 
made with a touchdown in sight prob­
ably had more to do with the final 
result than any other. The Panthers 
won, and they deserved to win, hut 
the score will not be 12-0 next year.
After the Pitt tussle the Skibos en­
joyed an open date. The rest wag 
needed as some of the men were in 
bad physical shape. The following 
week they took on Drexel Institute of 
Philadelphia. The boys from the east­
ern part of the state tried hard, but 
they were not equal to the task of 
stopping, the stream of touchdowns 
that Carnegie put across. This was 
one of the worst days that could be 
thought of for a football game. As 
one of the Pittsburgh papers said ar- 
ter the game. "Christoff fumbled. The 
ball was found in the mud ten yards 
away.” The final score was 40-0. This 
game was the chief attraction of Pa- 
Ma day.
Notre Dame was Carnegie’s hose on 
November 14. Rockne’s team may be 
green but they know a lot about foot­
ball. They had perfected a defense 
for the "spinner play”, and a mixed 
offense that scored four touchdowns 
and kicked two goals after touchdown. 
Anyone who saw that game was not 
disappointed in the showing the Tar­
tans made. Notre Dame was good, 
and will continue to be good as long 
as trey employ the present system of 
developing men. There were at least 
a hundred men in uniform during the 
game.
After -a long trip out into the mid­
dle west where St. Louis was turned 
back by a 18-2 score, Lehigh was met 
at Forbes Field. Never before in the 
history of the meetings of these two 
schools was Carnegie able to win the 
verdict. Revenge w*as sweet. Car­
negie -scored twice in the first and 
third periods, and once in the second 
and fourth. The offense was working 
smoothly, and the defense was air 
tight. This was the last game in 
which Cass and Kristof appeared for 
their Alma Mater, and they gave ev­
erything they had. The final returns 
were Carnegie 37, Lehigh 0, the worst 
defeat the Brown and White has had. 
in years.
Coaching during the last season was 
run as in previous years. "Wally” 
Steffen came here for the training 
camp period, and then returned for 
each game. His aide, Bob Waddell, 
had charge of the team in between 
visits, and very capably trained the 
men for their week-end tests. Bert 
Munhall and Doc Marks were on the 
job as usual.
Goodwin and Kristof on the ends 
were men to be feared at all timea. 
Both were fast in covering punts. 
They received very little opportunity 
to show how they could handle a for­
ward pass, but the few times they 
did, often caused the followers of the 
team to wonder why the pass was 
not used more. This was Ben’s fourth 
and last year on the varsity. His 
Place will be hard to fill. At tackle 
Myers and Yoder played a sterling 
gam with Marshall not far behind. 
The value of Yoder’s playing and the 
confidence the men placed in him is 
shown by the fact that his teammates 
have elected him captain for next 
year.
The guards were Cass and Cowan. 
iThis was Cowan's first year on the 
jpquad. He was the only regular on
LACROSSE
Plans for the formation of a Lacrosse team at Carnegie are taking a 
very definite shape. Graduate Manager Overend is arranging for the team’s 
equipment and is looking for suitable grounds upon which the game may be 
played. Dr. Barto Griffis of the Economics Department, a graduate of Johns 
Hopkins and a member of the varsity lacrosse team at that school for four 
years, is assisting in getting things moving and will aid in coaching the 
squad. Preliminary training will begin some time in January and a light 
schedule will be drawn up and presented at that time.LEARN TO DANCE

interest is being shown this year than in the past several seasons. The value 
of .organization and team work is probably receiving recognition.CLOTHES FOR THE COLLEGE MANNo need to invest a hundred dollars or more in such an

VARSITY BASKET BALL
The varsity basket ball program is essentially the same as that which 
now graces the pages of the Plebe “Bible.” The only change is in the ad­
dition of Michigan to the western trip. This schedule is extremely diffi­
cult and Coach Byerly has a very real problem to face.WHITTINGTON DRESS SUIT CO

HARRIERS CLOSE
SUCCESSFUL YEARB. B. SCHEDULE 
IS ANNOUNCEDDSYYMGM HOYY
On November 21, the Tartan har­
riers wound up the season with a win 
over the Geneva College harriers 27- 
•29. This ended a term that started 
poorly but finished with a hang.
The season was inaugurated with 
the annual Pitt meet, which Pitt, 
with a veteran team, carried off eas­
ily. Then came the Alfred meet; the 
New Yorkers nosing out Carnegie 35- 
20. The team then met a tartar in 
Westminster and went down to de­
feat 32-23.
The runners continued to show im­
provement as the season advanced 
and showed the best form in the 
Georgetown meet, which Carnegie 
won 26-29. This was run in Washing­
ton, over the Georgetown course and 
the victory came as a surprise to the 
Georgetown harriers, who had expec­
ted to win handily.
Coming home again they continued 
in their winning form and took Gen­
eva across. Every meet except the 
last two were run in the rain and 
mud which made the course very im­
possible. Under better conditions the 
Tartans would no doubt have had a 
much more successful season.
In Cant. Peck the team had a cap­
able runner and leader. ITimes showed 
up well, especially in the last two 
meets when he was at top form. Mc­
Nair and Salkin, newcomers to the 
team, did exceptionally well, as did 
I-Iobe, a member of last year’s Fresh­
man team. Ewing and Lustenberger 
completed a well balanced team.
Coach I-Ialferty worked hard to get 
together a winning combination, de­
voting most of his time to the new 
men. Considering the weather difficul­
ties he did exceptionally well with the 
material on hand.
Manager Wright made up a fine 
schedule, with two good trips, one to 
Washington. D. C. and the other to 
Beaver Falls. He also brought to 
Pittsburgh the b<?st teams in the Trl- 
state district.
The Plebos had a fine team this fall 
and prospects for a winning varsity 
next fall are bright. Starting the sea­
son by losing to the Pitt Freshmen 
did not discourage them, and they 
finished with wins over Shadyside 
Academy and the Pennsylvania Rail­
road teams.
Campbell showed up especially well 
and in the last meet nearly equalled 
the record for the Freshman course. 
Capt. Allison, Haven and Fuller also 
showed up well and should make fine 
varsity material next year.

With several weeks of practice now 
to their credit, the varsity basket 
ball squad is making very definite 
headway. 'Coach Dave Byerly is be­
ing assisted by his brother John, who 
coached W. & J. floor team last sea­
son. No cuts have been made in the 
size of the squad as yet, but Will prob­
ably be made in the near future. Sev­
eral very good men have been lost to 
the team through ineligibility due to 
the excessive strain on their schol­
astic word during the- past footfall 
season, in whioh they took part. 
"Dike” Beede and A1 Sebastian are 
expected to report for practice in n 
few days. Both of these men are re­
covering from minor injuries sustain­
ed while playing football.
The varsity roster now contains 
the following names: Conrad, Maur­
er, Amanc, F. W. Cook, Sneathen, 
Mack, Snow, Burnside, Jones, Ritts, 
Taylor, Kalloclc, Forbes, Kurty, Con­
nelly, Boccia, Knutson, West, Lynch, 
Cowan, Hurd, Shriver and J. A. Cook.
In booking a very attractive sched­
ule, Manager Harry Dietrich has de­
cided to hold no home games in the 
gym until after the mid-year exams. 
This will keep the floor clear for prac­
tice for the wooden stands will not 
be set up until during the last part 
of January. The big eastern trip of 
last season has been replaced by 
journey into the West, Including 
games with Notre Dame, Detroit and 
Miichigan Aggies. There are also sev­
eral other short trips, that tile team 
mill make.
The complete schedule is as fol- 
yows:
January 9—West Virginia, there.
January 12—-Geneva, there.
January 15—Pitt, there,
January 19—W. & J., there.
February 4—Westminster, here.

“THE MOVING PICTURE WRITES
AND HAVING WRIT, MOVES ON”
An agile thrust of a lance—Rudolph splashes into the 
moat, fflSrnerolda swoons into Sir Galahad's arms, and 
tho organ peals In triumph with the fadeout. Our 
sympathetic audience causes its frantic gum-chewing. 
Imbued with solemn zeal it turns reluctantly to a vul­
gar world of street cars and cafeterias. These cinema 
ilends, saturated with a strong dose of heraldry, cry 
out against tho machinery of our ultra-modern sphere, 
and pine for "Days of old, when knights were bold, and 
barons hold their sway.”
This malady of superficial enthusiasm towards an­
tiquity is ascrlbable not only to scenario geniuses, but 
to those ardent and persevering writers who assail the 
Hold ol’ literature with ornate exaggerations of "Knight­
hood's dauntless deed and Bounty's matchless aye."
Strangely, this pseudo interest is one of tho few dis­
orders that cannot bo imputed to tho present genera­
tion. Second-rate historical novelists are not responsi­
ble for Its appearance. !3oforo fiction thoro were bal­
lads, legonds, even mythology; and the boarded bard of 
tho dark ages deluded his audience as successfully as 
the atmospheric author of tho twentieth century. Tho 
past has always had a bewitching glamor. Many a 
medieval maiden would have traded her lofty turret for 
a Roman atrium, and gladly luivo deserted her com­
monplace knight for a centurlan or even a gladiator. 
And many a Pharo'M daughter would have bargained 
her glided couch and Jade bracelets for a more alluring 
existence In a tree top, with u pristine husband to ward 
oil' pythons and Jealous neighbors.
A most efficient panacea for tlijii sonMmontul re­
gard of the remote Is a critical, platonlc scrutiny of the 
era in nimbus. Tho severity of this method will dis­
pel llie most persistent halo. Behold tho medieval 
castle- -hattloinonts and banner, draw bridge and port­
cullis. This Is picturesque and ideal. Itul measure 
your stronghold with present standards of heating, 
ventilating and plumbing, and what a dormitory it be­
comes! The heroic perfection of Roblnhood totters 
whon one considers the dearth of tooth paste and Ivory 
soap. I'lven (lie clement, sophisticated waitress would 
be scandall*/,od at sorvlng a group of tenth century 
maidens who knew nothing of knives, forks or napkin 
rings. Illiteracy, too, was rampant in those thrilling 
middle nges. Proud Indeed was the baron who know 
Ills A II (Vs. for the rays of the lamp of learning rare­
ly beamed beyond tho monastery portals. In company 
with this universal ignorance was a devout fear ol nat­
ural phenomena. An epidemic of measles was inter­
preted as a merited punishment, and any preventative 
or curative measure was shockingly sacrilegoous. The 
discomfort that knowledge of such deficiencies brings 
to our idealists is sufficient evidence that their ap­
preciation of tho historical is spurious, irrelevant and 
transitory.
The remote rallies Its champions from the ranks of 
tho Intellectual us well as the emotional. One who 
penetrates the sentimental corona will see history as 
"the common adventure of all mankind.” The nuclei 
of a thousand contemporaneous conventions and cus­
toms will be revealed to him. The past affords, in ad­
dition, a psychological background. Mr. Robinson, who 
has explored this realm, concludes that “The examin­
ation of existing facts of history, by revealing the origin 
of many of our current fundimental beliefs, will tend to 
free our minds so as to permit honest thinking.”
But this rational attitude, like the romantic, has its 
imperfections, as Bertrand Russel has pointed out. He 
believes that "The habit of being unable to recognize 
merit until dead is too apt to be the result of a purely 
bookish life, and a culture based wholly on the past 
will seldom be able to pierce through every-day sur­
roundings to the essential splendor of contemporary 
things or to the hope of still greater splendor in the 
future.”
However, all this lamenting is futile. Though few of 
us are guilty of regarding the historical from an over- 
intellectual standpoint, no one escapes the inherent 
idealism, Tho past has always had a bewitching 
glamor; doubtless it will continue to fascinate. Could 
wo but peer forward a few centuries lvence we would 
find the same gum-chewing audience gripped in sus- 
ponso as our hero entered a den of steaming confu­
sion, siozed a square aluminum shield, and, armed with 
a solitary soup spoon, ran tho gauntlet, past an enamel 
counter, clutched, some pie, charged the cash register, 
and ultimately waved a paper napkin in surrender. 
And wo would wonder why those cinema llonds sighed 
for the days ol' the "Cafeteria Cavallor.“_________________
Popling akin to unanimity in tho Senior class tor 
snch adornments. Tho greatest proponents of tho 
scheme are those whoso vest fronts are continual­
ly cluttered up with fraternal emblems and those, 
who nurse a suppressed passion for such-a dis­
play. The largo majority, however, do not con­
tinually strive to bolster up an inferiority com­
plex by such billboard tactics and do not demand 
that the less-elect, gape at them. After all, they 
have only accomplished what any healthy young 
man should, be able to complete in four years.
Let us also point out that the most successful 
argument, advanced covertly and accepted silent­
ly, which led to the selection of a cloth hat, lay 
in that it could be folded up and carried in the 
pocket wlien off the campus. ' It is on such terms 
then, that we affect class delineation. And why, 
therefore, should we bother about distinctive at­
tire at all?

SCHEDULE FOR THISTLE 
PICTURES ANNOUNCED
Editor of The Carnegie Tartan,
Dear Sir: —
Under the heading of “For the Good 
of Carnegie.” I would like to suggest 
a though which has run In my mind 
and I'm sure must have occurred to 
many alumni and undergraduates 
heretofore, it is the thought of a 
War Memorial.
One of the most noticeable things 
of our campus is the lack of apprecia­
tion shown for the 'Carnegie men 
who fell in the World War. With all 
attention centered on the student of 
today and those of the future, little 
thought is given for those who pre­
ceded us and sb unselfishly gave up 
their education, to defend their coun­
try.
I believe that a very large percent­
age of Carnegie men and women feel 
that it is time to do something which 
will commemorate the memory' of 
these men.
A number of other schools have 
their memorials already erected and 
dedicated. Yaie at present is erecting 
hers in the form of a colonade on 
the side of a dining hall. Princeton 
has remodeled the entrance of Nassau 
Hall and dedicated the hall to the 
Princeton men who well during tho 
World War. What are we going to 
do? Are Carnegie men who made the 
supreme sacrifice going to be forgot­
ten?
I believe that every Carnegie man 
and woman will back some suitable 
plan to the limit if given an oppor­
tunity. The need is here and the 
time has arrived. Let’s have a War 
Memorial at Carnegie.
Very truly yours,
A STUDENT.

ON OTHER CAMPUSES.
When the curtain goes up for tho 
opening performance of “Jacqueline," 
to bo given by the students of Holy 
Cross College, many of the Purple’s 
athletic luminaries will be seen over 
tho fool lights., Such names as Jack 
Crowley. Bill Glennon, Warren Cote 
and several others are in tho cast.
Ohio State adopted a novel way of 
teaching true sportsmanship. At a re­
cent contest handbills on which were 
printed five fundamentals of sports­
manship were distributed to the stu­
dents. One paragraph defended the 
right of the coach to do his own coach­
ing!
The University of Florida claims the 
distinction of having .more men en­
gaged in intra-mural sports than any 
college in the country. She bases her 
claim on the fact that ninety-eight per 
cent took part in the campus-wide 
athletic program last year. Listed 
among the sports is “Horseshoes.”
St. Xavier’s College, Cincinnati, re­
quires every man entering the Coilege 
of Liberal Arts to submit to an intelli­
gence and psychology test.
This letter was inopportunely mis­
placed enroute to the publisher. Al­
though a little late, we feel that it still 
carries a message of great import to 
Carnegie.
Beloved Brothers:
Wo, some sons of Carnegie of some­
what ancient vintage and therefore 
ripening and sobering wisdom, viewed 
with no little disgust the childish ex­
hibition of undergraduate humor be­
tween the halves of the Pitt game. 
We, and many thousands of Carnegie 
friends and friendly enemies, were 
supposed to be amused by a mock 
Walpurgisnacht of beardless witches, 
about a small mortar of refractory and 
uncertain detonating habits, clothed, 
(the witches, not the mortar), in Ku 
Klux hoods of Ethiopian hue, dancing 
if their cavortings can be so called; 
without recognizable rythm and with 
obvious fear of the devilish toy in 
their midst. We do not insist upon 
unfailing originality from our well­
loved Alma Mater but, in the name of 
all the Gods, let us choose well what 
is to bo imitated. To sum up and 
make the idea quite clear: this was, in 
our opinion, a poor idea poorly copied.

Carnegie bosoms thrilled with just 
pride of their Own.
As for auxiliary stunts: How about 
the Pipers, they were greatly missed 
as was also the ancient Kilty Mon of 
bony face and knee and hirsute leg. 
And a Permanent Mascot? Wo think,

Mr. Otto H. Kahn, in the opening 
address of the Theater Conference 
held two weeks ago outlined 
the policies and the purposes of 
the little theater movement with un­
usual clarity and foresight. Believing 
that his statements will prove of gen­
eral interest, his theme, though in a 
greatly condensea form, follows:
I wish to stress the point that far 
too much of young America’s artistic 
talent goes to waste for lack of guid­
ance and opportunity.
With us, where, in the ordinary 
coarse of things, can a young aitist 
seeking a stage career find compara­
ble openings for practical guidance 
and learning and development?
Where can young playwrights get 
their works produced effectively, ex­
cept in the over-crowded mart of New 
York?
Tip stock companies, unfortunately, 
are vanishing more and more. The av­
erage young artist applying for an en­
gagement at an average Broadway 
manager’s office is first met with the 
question: “What experience have
you had?” ar.d if the answer is: 
“None” or "Little” the manager’s 
more or less gerrtle- rejoinder would 
be. generally and not unnaturally, 
that his theater is not a school for be­
ginners and that the Metropolitan 
public is "hard-boileed” and exacting.
Of course, there are exceptional 
cases. Some theaters of pioneering 
tendencies do exist in New York. 
Some young artists have the good 
fortune or the conspicuous qualifica­
tions to come to the front quickly.
But who can estimate how many 
other young talents there may be 
who knock in vain at the door of op­
portunity, how many there may be 
who pass through that all too trite 
tragedy of qualities, impulses and as­
pirations, thwarted, starved or denied 
and turned to gall and wormwood 
within them.
The large number of community 
theaters, little theaters, college thea- 
ers, etc., which have sprung up in 
recent years have much useful work, 
to their credit, and their advent and 
activities are to be cordially wel 
corned. But most of these theaters, 
thus far, are very limited in their 
means and scope of action, in their 
influence and effectiveness.
They should successfully challenge 
the “moyieS> for public patronage. 
They should become centers for 
quickening and broadening the public 
interest and for shaping and advanc­
ing the public taste. And in order to 
become measureably near accomplish­
ing their due functions, they must 
avoid, as a cardinal sin, to be—or 
even arousing the suspicion of being 
—high-brow, anaemic, exclusive, su­
perior, but must be bold, red-blooded, 
broad-gauged and appealing, taking 
due cognizance of the psychology of 
the people and giving due heed to the 
legitimate devices of showmanship.
That does not mean descending to 
a mean level. To meet the thoughts, 
feelings and aspirations of the rank 
and the file of the people does not 
mean pandering to unworthy stand­
ards. Fundamentally, their bent and 
mood, their propensities of mind and 
soul, spring from contact with, and 
take resonance from the actualities of 
life
I believe tnat a democratic appe.il 
to the people is possible even In art. 
In saying this, 1 do not intend to im­
ply that every “horny-handed son. of 
toil”’ is qualified to become ah art 
connoisseur, neither do I assert that 
the people, by and large, whatever 
their station, are born with good 
taste. On the contrary, the vast ma­
jority, whether of rich or poor parent­
age, are born with a natural tenden­
cy to respond to the garish, vivid and 
obvious rather than to the mellow, 
restrained, subtle and aesthetic.
But I do believe that the Amer­
ican-people are susceptible to the 
message of art, that they are respon­
sive to education and example in art. 
that they welcome and gladly follow 
leadership on the road to knowledge 
and discernment, that they are eager 
to learn, quick to perceive, and that, 
having once become imbued with cor­
rect standards of appreciation, they 
may generally be trusted to retain 
and apply them.
And the souls of many people are 
hungry. More and more of them are 
feeling the need of something wholly 
different from material needs and 
aims, which shall make the contents 
of their>Iives' fuller and richer and 
more satisfying. There are but few, 
very few, fields where that flower i3 
growing which, consciously or intui­
tively, they seek. One of those fields, 
the greatest next to religion, is that 
of art
America, in the past century had the 
formidable task of conquering a con­
tinent, physically, industrially, eco­
nomically, and it was necessary that 
the best brains, the intenscst energies 
and activities of its people should 
devote themselves to that stern and 
exacting task of maleral effoirt. That 
consummation has been accomplished.
America- stands today—and prom­
ises to stand for many a day—the' 
most prosperous, and economically 
and .industrially, the most puissant, 
nation in the world. We can afford 
—and ought—to occupy ourselves in­
creasingly with the things of the 
spirit, with art, science, culture. And 
there is every evidence that this evo­
lution is in fact taking place.
From all that I have endeavored to 
set forth, there emerges, as I see it, 
one overshadowing need. It is the 
need for leadership. And the natural 
recruiting ground, the natural depot, 
for supplying that leadership are the 
universities and colleges.
The scope of leadership which lies 
before our universities and colleges 
in the field of dramatic art is great 
indeed. Its potential fruitfulness can 
hardly be overestimated. The 'value 
and diversity of the influence which 
it is open to these seats of learning 
to exercise in the fulfillment of that 
mission, warrants the active zeal and 
the most careful and earnest consid­
eration on the part of those with, 
whom rests the function to mobilize 
and marshal that force.
The book of American art is young 
But few of its pages have been writ­
ten as yet. I hope and believe that 
the results which are to flow from 
the present meeting will be such as to 
warrant a signal record of this occa­
sion in that book of American art, a 
book destined to tell, I feel sure, of 
high and fine achievements,' worthy 
of a great and high-souled people.

ball games is the custom at the Uni­

GORGOYLES OR GODS?
For the Nth successive week we present in the 
news columns an episode ol' our serial story, “Co­
operation—The World and Carnegie.” in this 
issue we announce the gift of valuable photo­
metric apparatus to the Physics Department by 
.the Society of Illuminating Engineers: Science's 
¡recognition of the schools ; last week the National. 
Theater Conference was held here: Art acknowl­
edged our leadership; three weeks ago OJarnegie 
sponsored the Pennsylvania Plumbers' Institute: 
industry looked to our instructors for enlighten­
ment.
We had always thought of Carnegie as an in­
stitution endowed solely and completely by the 
Carnegie Corporation. Events this year have 
forced us to modify this opinion. The Corpora­
tion has subsidized us. However, we cannot over­
look in tin,* inventory of our possessions, equip­
ment and- properties of intrinsic value, received 
from other sources.
Practically every department in the school ben­
efits by specific services from outside interests. 
¦The Printing Department lias received almost all 
of its equipment gratis. Firms of the Pittsburgh 
district send lecturers every week to the Commer­
cial Engineering Department. The National As­
sociation of Master Plumbers has established a 
Professorship in the Plumbing Department. The 
Bureau of Mines is closely associated with our 
Mining and Metallurgical Department.
We thus perceive a growing interrelationship 
'between the work-a-day world and Carnegie. The 
modern American cosmos approves of the unique 
educational principles in force or in process of 
development here. The Administration has suc­
cessfully adapted the school to the needs of the 
nation today. All this implies probable prosper­
ity and success for Carnegie graduates.
Docs it imply anything further?
It emphasizes the import of attention to the 
question, “How shall we build Carnegie?'' Shall 
we let outside forces chiefly determine our poli­
cies'/ Shall we yield to the impact of industry, 
turn out eactly the type of man industry says 
she needs, or modify these men as humanism dic­
tates? Shall we hypertrophy our art students? 
It is probably the surest way to cultivate their 
latent genius.
You smile at theso questions. The same old 
hokum, you say.
Perhaps this will jar you into consciousness:
At a recent meeting of the Printing Depart­
ment faculty it was avowed that the fondest 
hopes of the administration—the production of 
printing executives and technicians with a truly 
broad college education—is impossible of accom­
plishment. The writer cannot believe that state­
ment. Close association with this department has 
convinced him that; failure has resulted not be­
cause of incompetence of instructors, nor because 
of the nature of the students, nor because the 
scope of this vision cannot be encompassed in tho
available time...but because the question, “How
shall wo build the Printing Department?’' has 
never been completely analyzed and definitely 
answered. We believe the Administratioji has 
the right idea an idea that should be given more 
complete expression than has ever been accorded 
it in tho past.
So here wo are at the old basis of contention. 
Carnegie has booon reared without precedence or 
illustrative example-—should she have been rear­
ed under stricter supervision?
We of the present day reiterate tho rcquost 
made in this column by Alumnus Lowell W. 
Nichols. We love Carnegie and would do our 
l)it to place her atop the world. However, we 
lovo our fellowmen even more, and would liko 
to know what Carnegie is going to make of tliti 
bits of clay that she is molding.

Tho above was submitted to the Editor and is 
not wholly in accord with his views. A rather 
sweeping generalisation is suggested by a specific 
example—an unfortunate example since the fac­
ility turnover of the department which is cited, 
is of startling magnitude and consequently im­
plies erratic policy. Hence the assertion of im­
possibility may be regarded rather as the sim­
mering of new elements in strange surroundings 
unguided by well-established precedent; trying to 
work out a destiny for themselves, than as a true 
.definition of inherent limitations.
THE PRICE OF ORIGINALITY; OR WHY 
SENIORS WILL WEAR HATS
At a meeting last Friday to which all the Se­
nior men were invited and which a fair number 
attended, it was decided that in the choice of an 
article of apparel by which the fourth year man 
might readily be differentiated from the less im­
portant underclassmen and inconsequential young 
instructors, by even the uninitiated, that a hat, 
silver gray in color and similar in shape to that 
of the Druids, be adopted inasmuch as such head­
gear would not only lend the desired air of dis­
tinction to the otherwise rather commonplace 
northern extension of the Senior, but -would also 
be in keeping with his specification for something 
neat but not gaudy.
The Civil Engineers added a colorful touch to 
the discussion by displaying for the first time, 
their now canes—quite ordinary canes except in 
their coloring of red and white to resemble stadia 
rods, and looking rather like barber polos, freshly 
plucked from the forest primeval during infancy. 
There can be but lit tle doubt that th’is unexpected 
debut of artistic imagination swerved many to 
champion the cause of hats.
And consider too that a cane’s usefulness is 
limited. It may be used to poke at pictures and 
¿lowers, but. how many Seniors ever have this 
•opportunity: it. may be employed for poking 
¡holes in the ground to provide diversion while 
conversing with a damsel in the hours before 
dusk. But one might as well give the Senior a 
poke.. It would prove more serviceable and hard­
ly less dangerous in inexperienced hands. To 
carry a cane merely by way of decoration might 
be construed as effeminacy and for a Senior to 
appear effeminate—madre mio! A cane is out 
of the question.
Now in a hat we have the very reverse of ef­
feminacy. Don’t Seniors in all colleges wear 
them? In many, in a great many colleges, Se­
niors give indication of their super-virility 
through broad-brimmed Stetsons just like the he­
roes of James Oliver Curwood. With such a mas­
culine chapeau how can the Senior be other than 
irresistable in his manly charms?
But we don’t wish to insinuate that there is any
