The Steel City Naval Re-
serve Of?cer Training Corps 
(ROTC), consisting of stu-
dents from Carnegie Mellon 
University, University of Pitts-
burgh, and Duquesne Univer-
sity, hosted a ceremony on the 
Cut in honor of Veteran’s Day 
last Wednesday.
The event included re-
marks by ROTC Unit Com-
manding Of?cer Captain Jeff 
Coran, trustees Torrence Hunt 
Jr., Don Carter, and Jay Sukits, 
as well as a moment of remem-
brance, taps, and lowering the 
?ag at sunset.
Many veterans were in the 
audience. An introduction by 
Captain Jeff Coran includ-
ed excerpts from President 
Obama’s Veteran’s Day 2015 
Proclamation, in which he 
states, “Our veterans left ev-
erything they knew and loved 
and served with exemplary 
dedication and courage so we 
could all know a safer America 
and a more just world. They 
have been tested in ways the 
rest of us may never fully un-
derstand. On Veterans Day, 
and every day, [they] let us 
show them the extraordinary 
gratitude they so rightly de-
serve, and let us recommit to 
pledging our full support for 
them in all they do.”
Hunt re?ected on the his-
tory of ROTC at Carnegie 
Mellon, remarking that “Carn-
egie Mellon has had a long 
and close af?liation with the 
U.S. Department of Defense 
in supporting the military 
of our country.” Hunt talked 
about how Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus was used as a tempo-
rary training ground for U.S. 
soldiers during World War I 
and World War II, “with stu-
dents going to and from class 
alongside soldiers training to 
defend our country and our 
way of life.” 
However, the Vietnam War 
era of the late ’60s and early 
’70s was marked by wide-
spread student protests and 
antiwar sentiment across the 
country. Don Carter, a Viet-
nam veteran, graduated from 
the Carnegie Mellon School of 
Architecture in 1967 as a mem-
ber of the ROTC program. 
Carter remarked that during 
the time period, many uni-
versities got rid of their ROTC 
programs. He was proud and 
found it a “wonderful thing” 
to still see Midshipmen (Naval 
ROTC students) in uniform on 
campus today.
Another Vietnam veteran, 
Jay Sukits, now a professor at 
the University of Pittsburgh’s 
College of Business Adminis-
tration, spoke about a fellow 
Vietnam veteran, a captain 
and mentor who had trained 
him, Edward Francis Miles. 
In 1969, near the Cambodian 
border, Miles stepped on a 
land mine as he ran forward 
to check on wounded soldiers. 
He sustained horri?c injuries, 
including amputations of both 
legs below the knee, loss of his 
right eye, and his right arm 
rendered permanently use-
less. “The personal courage he 
exhibited still stays with me 
today” Sukits said.
After the war, Miles even-
tually became an associate 
director of the Vietnam Vet-
erans of America Foundation 
(VVAF), traveling the world 
to raise funds to help war sur-
vivors. He worked with the 
International Campaign to 
Ban Landmines, which won 
the Nobel Peace Prize in 1997. 
He passed away 35 years af-
ter he sustained his injuries 
during the  Vietnam War. His 
name was engraved on the 
Vietnam Veterans War Memo-
rial in Washington, D.C., on 
May 4, 2010.
In response to the “pro-
testers and naysayers” of the 
Vietnam Era, Sukits remarked, 
“Vietnam veterans served with 
great honor and dignity. They 
returned to a country that 
ignored them at best, and at 
worst, vili?ed them”.
Sukits then read a short 
poem called “Remember 
Them.” Afterwards, a mo-
ment of silence was held dur-
ing “evening colors,” the U.S. 
Navy’s ceremonial lowering 
of the ?ag at sunset, while the 
solemn sounds of two trum-
pets was heard across the Cut.
Near the end of Hunt’s 
speech, he had remarked, “The 
military is not just about war-
fare; indeed, it is also about 
peace. It is about helping oth-
ers around the world, who 
yearn for freedom to achieve, 
in their own way, the kinds of 
blessings and privileges that 
we Americans sometimes take 
for granted”.
Today, the Naval ROTC unit 
is hosted on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, while Air Force ROTC 
and Army ROTC are hosted at 
the University of Pittsburgh.

Students show solidarity for Mizzou
Brandon Hong/Staff Photographer 
On Wednesday night, students from Carnegie Mellon and the University of Pittsburgh gathered to show solidarity for the students of the University of 
Missouri. “The fact that someone can feel comfortable enough to say that they would go around shooting black people: it hit somewhere close to me 
personally,” senior mechanical engineering major Kayode Dansalami said. “Because that could happen to me. And it’s strange to think that I can’t 
feel safe on campus, going to class.” See the full story on A3.

Last week, representatives 
of Tor, a network of servers 
used to guarantee anonym-
ity on the Internet, accused 
Carnegie Mellon computer 
scientists of selling research 
to the FBI that compromised 
the volunteer-run service and 
exposed information about 
users of “the dark web” to the 
FBI and others.
Tor, which stands for 
The Onion Router, helps us-
ers of the dark web do their 
business anonymously. “The 
dark web” refers broadly to 
any part of the Internet not 
indexed by search engines, 
and is home to black markets 
such as the now defunct Silk 
Road 2.0, a traf?cking hub 
for illegal items. In such black 
markets, users of the dark 
web can ?nd illicit goods 
ranging from fake passports, 
to drugs, to stolen identities.
“Apparently these [Carn-
egie Mellon] researchers 
were paid by the FBI to at-
tack hidden services users in 
a broad sweep, and then sift 
through their data to ?nd 
people whom they could ac-
cuse of crimes,” Tor wrote on 
its blog.
The suspicion against 
Carnegie Mellon began when 
a group of researchers pulled 
out of the Black Hat Confer-
ence, a conference for hack-
ers and the cybersecurity 
community. At the confer-
ence, the researchers were 
slated to give a talk on how 
to break into Tor using only 
$3000 worth of hardware.
Tor alleges that the FBI 
paid $1 million dollars to 
Carnegie Mellon’s Computer 
Emergency Response Team 
(CERT), part of the Software 
Engineering Institute (SEI), 
for the research.
This conduct, the orga-
nization says, violates the 
tenets of ethical research. Ac-
cording to Tor’s blog, “There 
is no indication yet that they 
had a warrant or any institu-
tional oversight by Carnegie 
Mellon’s Institutional Review 
Board. We think it’s unlikely 
they could have gotten a 
valid warrant for [Carnegie 
Mellon’s] attack as conduct-
ed, since it was not narrowly 
tailored to target criminals or

A new web tool developed 
in collaboration between 
senior system/software 
engineering major Saman 
Amirpour Amraii and post-
doctoral researcher Amir 
Yahyavi at the CREATE Lab 
within the Robotics Insti-
tute called Explorable Visual 
Analytics, or EVA, enables 
researchers to interact with 
and make sense of large data 
sets. According to the uni-
versity press release, “the 
tool uses a novel computer 
architecture that enables 
the analyst to explore raw 
data through dynamic visu-
alizations with minimal time 
delay.”
With data sets of this size, 
researchers are usually de-
pendent on automated pro-
cesses that remove the ele-
ment of human judgment, 
but with the tool, users can 
select portion of data to be 
analyzed. It then allows the 
user to select different pa-
rameters and changes the 
visual to the most appropri-
ate graphic representation.
The system also stores 
the dataset at large on an 
external server and then 
downloads small portions 
of relevant data as they are 
analyzed. Amraii noted that 
keeping the system speedy 
was one of their main goals 
because “If it takes a half 
hour to get an answer to your 
query, you may forget why 
you asked in the ?rst place.”
The team has tested their 
work on data from the U.S. 
Census Bureau’s Longitu-
dinal Employer-Household 
Dynamics to analyze the 
racial makeup of Philadel-
phia neighborhoods, and 
they hope to explore data 
on global deforestation, 
data from the Department of 
Transportation, and simple 
business analytics.
The research is supported 
by Google and the tool can

CREATE Lab develops tool to simplify data
Project RE_ to reuse, rebuild, and restore
Monday, Nov. 16, will be 
the official start of Project 
RE_, a vision that after 10 
years of planning will fi-
nally become a reality. John 
Folan, a professor in Carn-
egie Mellon’s School of Ar-
chitecture, created the proj-
ect as a way to help improve 
urban communities.
In an effort to encourage 
people to avoid wasting re-
sources, Project RE_ strives 
to reuse materials that are 
already available. RE stands 
for the project’s goal of col-
laboration to reuse mate-
rial, rebuild communities, 
and restore lives.
The event will oversee 
Folan joining with partners 
from Construction Junction 
(CJ) and the Trade Institute 
of Pittsburgh (TIP) to see 
the official start of the proj-
ect, which will be a part of 
the School of Architecture’s 
Urban Design Build Studio 
(UDBS).
Construction Conjunc-
tion will provide mate-
rials from their decon-
struction projects while 
collaborating with TIP and 
UDBS to develop methods 
of processing the materials 
and re-imagining their use 
through design.
Monday’s dedication 
takes place at 3:30 at Proj-
ect RE_’s hub housed in 
Construction Conjunction. 
In attendance will be Pitts-
burgh Mayor Bill Peduto, 
Allegheny County Execu-
tive Rich Fitzgerald, and 
University Provost Farnam 
Jahanian, all of whom have 
played a part in the creation 
of this project.

Leading ?gures in innova-
tion gave lightning talks as 
part of Innovation Palooza 
last week, while students par-
ticipated in the second ever 
Impact-a-Thon and saw dem-
onstrations of innovation at 
various companies.
Michael Bruce, Alexis 
Roberts-McIntosh, and Harry 
Shimp, three leading ?gures in 
innovation, spoke at the event.
Michael Bruce, President & 
CEO of InScope Technologies 
International, shared how his 
experience as a ?rst genera-
tion American instilled an in-
novative spirit in him which 
lead to the creation of his com-
pany. “Be true to yourself,” 
Bruce said. He said that to be 
a successful entrepreneur one 
should not limit herself to be-
ing a specialist, but should ex-
tend her scope of knowledge 
to understand her rivals.
Alexis Roberts-McIntosh, 
formerly vice president of re-
search and development at 
Johnson & Johnson, discussed 
how innovation impacts the 
consumer products industry, 
saying that to be successful 
one should make the experi-
ence of customers remarkable. 
“Don’t wait until somebody 
else has done it,” Roberts-Mc-
Intosh said. Moreover, she not-
ed that start-ups should work 
collaboratively with partners 
to achieve success.
Lastly, Harry Shimp, Se-
nior Operating Partner of 
MCM Capital, talked about 
the importance of innovation 
in manufacturing and encour-
aged students to pursue inno-
vation in their works.
Apart from the lightning 
talks, the Impact-a-Thon stu-
dent competition offered a 
platform where students’ 
projects would be evaluated 
by judges, with the top three 
projects receiving prizes. 
Students offered vari-
ous designs to help disabled 
children access recreation 
facilities. For example, the 
team that made Terra Chairs 
offered a mobile base that at-
taches to a wheelchair and 
allows disabled children to ac-
cess many places with the base 
working like a crawler. 
Some students offered de-
signs that allowed disabled 
children to play with other 
children. For example design 
majors Yubing Zhang, Zan 
Lee, Xingsuo Liu, and Lynn 
Sandberg created Carolina 
Swing, a swing made of wood 
chips with a folding back and 
fording arm supports.  On the 
same note, Team Awesome 
Impacto created a play center 
called “Once Upon a Time.” 
With a stall engraved with 
Braille on one side, the cen-
ter was accessible to children 
with and without disabilities.
The projects were judged 
throughout the event, and 
three winners were chosen.
The ?rst prize went to team 
Soundsation, comprising four 
students: ?fth-year mechani-
cal engineering majors Matt 
Powell-Palm, Allen Miller, and 
Judy Han, and Braden Kell, a 
masters student in electrical 
and computer engineering. 
Their creation, Trebelcade, 
offered an interactive musical 
platform for autistic children. 
The wall-shaped Trebelcade 
was equipped with ultrasonic 
proximity sensors. When play-
ers approach the sensors with 
their hands, Trebelcade would 
sound a note and light up to 
direct the player to the next 
note, thus composing a small 
piece of work. Trebelcade al-
lowed for interaction without 
direct touching, which is often 
a source of over-stimulation 
for autistic children. In this 
way, team Soundsation was 
able to help over 1.1 million 
autistic children in the US 
have fun with music, which 
could help develop their com-
munication skills.
The second prize went to 
the team that created Uni-
ty Playgrounds, a modular 
system with each module de-
signed for a certain kind of 
disability, and by assembling 
them to one’s needs, the facil-
ity could accommodate many 
needs.
The third prize laureates 
presented Wonder Wheels, 
another modular system, that 
allowed children to create an 
event and maintain the friend-
ship outside the equipment 
with an affordable price.
Innovation Palooza also 
gathered companies who had 
brought their demos to the 
campus. 4Moms showed an 
electric folding trolley and an 
electric cradle that could rock 
a baby without its mother. 
Other companies includ-
ed Amazon Robotics, Ansys, 
Automated Dynamics, Axis, 
Bosch, Corning Glass, Hill-
crest Labs, Kennametal, Per-
formance Plastics, and Sim-
coach Games: all providing 
students with information or 
chances for internships and 
job opportunities. 
Moreover, Innovation 
Palooza had some faculty/
student demos including 3-D 
bioprinting, showcasing how 
to 3-D print in gelatin. Others 
included robotic prostheses 
and exoskeletons, changing 
polymers to metals, pulmo-
nary drug delivery, Wakecap, 
and CMU Rwanda program.

Students from Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh joined a national 
conversation on race and cam-
pus politics last Wednesday 
when they gathered to show 
solidarity with University of 
Missouri students. At 9 p.m., 
over one hundred students 
from both Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pitts-
burgh, as well as a scattered 
few other members of the 
campus community, gathered 
in the Jared L. Cohon Univer-
sity Center’s Kirr Commons, 
more commonly known as the 
black chairs.
The event came only hours 
after two students at the Uni-
versity of Missouri were ar-
rested for making threats 
against black students on the 
state university’s ?agship Co-
lumbia campus. According to 
the Associated Press, Univer-
sity of Missouri students Con-
nor Stottlemyre and Hunter 
Park were arrested separately 
for posting explicitly violent, 
racially charged messages to 
the anonymous app Yik Yak. 
Stottlemyer wrote, “I’m go-
ing to shoot any black people 
tomorrow, so be ready,” con-
tributing to a maelstrom of 
racial tension on the Missouri 
campus.
The protests at the Univer-
sity of Missouri have resonated 
with students at Carnegie Mel-
lon. “The fact that someone 
can feel comfortable enough 
to say that they would go 
around shooting black people: 
It hit somewhere close to me 
personally,” senior mechani-
cal engineering major Kayode 
Dansalami said. “Because that 
could happen to me. And it’s 
strange to think that I can’t 
feel safe on campus, going to 
class.” Dansalami helped or-
ganize the assembly as part of 
Spirit, a campus organization 
for fostering a sense of black 
community and championing 
black awareness.
Students at the Univer-
sity of Missouri have faced 
backlash from those who 
consider student responses 
overwrought and overreac-
tive — on Monday, both the 
president and the chancellor 
of the University of Missouri 
resigned after continued criti-
cism from students, including 
a hunger strike and protest 
from the university’s football 
team. 
During Wednesday’s dem-
onstration, Carnegie Mellon 
and University of Pittsburgh 
students instead showed soli-
darity with students at the 
University of Missouri. “We 
came up with this idea when 
we thought, ‘We should do 
something to show our sup-
port,” said Mattie Hedgebeth, 
a senior psychology major 
and one of the organizers of 
Wednesday’s event.
Hedgebeth, who serves as 
the black awareness chair of 
Spirit, said that the event came 
together quickly with the help 
of a social media push and a 
Facebook event made only a 
few hours before the 9 p.m. 
gathering. “With the miracle 
of social media, we were able 
to get all of these people from 
all of these different places to 
come,” she said.
Members of Spirit also 
worked with the University of 
Pittsburgh’s Black Action So-
ciety, drawing a wide array of 
students from both schools. 
At the event, students 
posed for a picture that they 
posted on Facebook and in-
tend to send to student activ-
ists at the University of Mis-
souri. “We want to show our 
support. We can’t be there, but 
we want to help,” Hedgebeth 
said.
At the event, members 
of Spirit and the University 
of Pittsburgh’s Black Action 
Society spoke to the crowd, 
endorsing the protests at the 
University of Missouri and at-
tempting to begin a discussion 
on race and diversity at Carn-
egie Mellon and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
A member of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Graduate Student 
Assembly also spoke at the 
gathering to show his support 
for Jonathan Butler, a gradu-
ate student at the University 
of Missouri who embarked on 
a hunger strike that lasted for 
eight days on the condition of 
the removal of the university’s 
president.
“It was a collective effort,” 
senior psychology major and 
Vice President of Spirit Yami-
nah Carter said of the event. 
“A lot of us agreed that we 
wanted to do something, that 
we wanted to show solidar-
ity with the students. Some-
one made the Facebook page, 
someone made the posters — 
it was all really fast. “
M. Shernell Smith, assis-
tant director of Student Affairs 
and and housefellow of the In-
tersection, emphasized a need 
for a campus conversation 
that leads to tangible action. 
“I think what’s happening at 
Mizzou and Yale and all these 
other places is that people 
are asking, ‘So what are some 
things we can do together — 
not just talking about, but 
actually happening,’ ” Smith 
said. “What I appreciate is 
the fact that you can tell that 
there is work to be done, and 
there is work to be done here 
at Carnegie Mellon.”
“With the 
miracle of social 
media, we were 
able to gather all 
of these different 
people from 
different place to 
come. ”

criminal activity, but instead 
appears to have indiscrimi-
nately targeted many users at 
once.”
“Apparently these re-
searchers were paid by the 
FBI to attack hidden services 
users in a broad sweep, and 
then sift through their data 
to ?nd people whom they 
could accuse of crimes,” the 
post continues. “Such action 
is a violation of our trust and

this attack crosses the crucial 
line between research and en-
dangering innocent users.”
“I’d like to see the substan-
tiation for their claim,” Ed 
Desautels, part of the SEI’s

clining to comment further. 
When The Tartan reached 
out, university of?cials de-
clined to comment.
Tor’s exploited vulnerabili-
ties were patched last year, 
but not before they lead to the 
arrest of Brian Richard Fer-
rell, who was charged with 
conspiracy to distribute her-
oin, methamphetamine, and 
cocaine.
According to the search 
warrant against Ferrell’s 
house, a “Source of Informa-
tion (SOI)” provided “reliable 
IP addresses for TOR and hid-
den services such as SR2.” For 
months, the source remained 
unidenti?ed.
In mid-October, however, 
Ferrell’s defense introduced 
a motion claiming that a 
“research-based institution” 
gave the government the in-
formation used to arrest Fer-
rell. Soon, Motherboard drew 
a connection between Carn-
egie Mellon and the compro-
mised Tor servers. 
In a statement to Ars Tech-
nica, the FBI denied the alle-
gations. “The allegation that 
we paid [Carnegie Mellon 
University] $1 million to hack 
into Tor is inaccurate,” an FBI 
spokeswoman told the web-
site last Friday.

Ambassador R. Nicholas 
Burns came to Carnegie Mel-
lon to talk about “The Future 
of America’s National Secu-
rity” last Tuesday.
Having played a leader-
ship role in U.S. foreign policy 
toward the Middle East and 
Asia and becoming one of 
the nation’s top career dip-
lomats as undersecretary 
of state for political affairs 
from 2005–2008, R. Nicholas 
Burns offered a big-picture 
perspective of the country’s 
position on the world stage. 
Burns, former Ambassador to 
Greece and NATO, “re?ects 
the intellectual culture we 
seek to create in the Institute 
for Politics and Strategy. In 
his many years in the state 
department’s Foreign Service 
and now as a professor at the 
Harvard Kennedy School of 
Government, Ambassador 
Burns had become one of 
our nation’s top experts both 
in politics and strategy,” said 
Richard Scheines, dean of the 
Dietrich College for Humani-
ties and Social Sciences.
The Ambassador’s lifelong 
trajectory supports the no-
tion that one may start as an 
intern, following their pas-
sions in school, and through 
dedication and hard work, 
eventually be called upon to 
negotiate some of the most 
challenging issues in the 
world today. “Carnegie Mel-
lon has such an incredible 
reputation as one of our lead-
ing schools for engineering 
and computer science, being 
on the cutting edge of our 
21st century economy, but it 
does have to be balanced by 
an understanding of global 
policy and global affairs,” 
Burns said.
A great part of Burns’ mes-
sage focused on international 
cooperation and the United 
States’ role as a global lead-
er, in any metric devised. He 
drew attention to the United 
States having the greatest 
economy in the world, an in-
credibly innovative student 
population, and an insur-
mountable amount of politi-
cal in?uence. All of this com-
bined highlights the country’s 
responsibility to maintain the 
safety and security of its own 
borders, but also the rest of 
the world — “in a global age, 
if we’re not engaged as the 
leader of a coalition, if we’re 
nor helping other people, 
then we injure our own secu-
rity as well as theirs” Burns 
said.
The elimination of bound-
aries brought on by globaliza-
tion has not only stimulated 
the global economy, but has 
also transformed the way na-
tions look at predicaments. 
Climate change is one of those. 
The future of clean energy 
jobs and high tech jobs will 
be born in universities such as 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology or Carnegie Mel-
lon, Burns said, and it is that 
kind of forward thinking that 
makes the United States an in-
dispensable and exceptional 
power when it comes to lead-
ing change. Transnational 
alliances are key to solving 
this problem. Reaching out 
to countries such as China 
or India, some of the world’s 
largest carbon emitters, and 
redacting a climate agree-
ment are believed to be some 
of the most important things 
President Obama will do dur-
ing his mandate. By mid-De-
cember, the ?rst global con-
tract on climate change will 
most likely emerge, where 
every country in the world 
agrees to a mandated level of 
diminished carbon emissions, 
on a schedule that will take us 
forward during the next 30 or 
40 years.
Other important issues 
that cross oceans and physi-
cal barriers are the traf?ck-
ing of women and children as 
well as organized crime rings 
and drug cartels. There are 
so many elements involved in 
?nding solutions to these is-
sues, all of which require an 
enormous amount of coop-
eration.
“Part of it is getting to the 
source of the issue beyond 
America, but the most impor-
tant part is getting to the root 
of the problem in our own 
country, in the hearts and 
minds and insecurities of our 
own kids, who are dependent 
on drugs,” R. Nicholas Burns 
said in an effort to highlight 
the role education plays in the 
mitigation of several global 
problems. Nonetheless, the 
magnitude of these issues 
requires the support of not 
only several nations, but also 
several resources such as the 
military, every level of gov-
ernment, and also businesses 
in America.
“Think about what is at 
stake in the transnational do-
main,” Burns said. “We have 
to be out there, engaging oth-
er countries as a leader and 
?ght these problems before 
they can assault us.”
The lecture marked the 
introduction of Dietrich Col-
lege of Humanities and Social 
Sciences’ new academic unit 
which will focus on the study 
of political science, interna-
tional relations and national 
security. Under the direc-
tion of Kiron K. Skinner, who 
brings an enormous amount 
of scholarship, energy, and 
dedication to the enterprise, 
the Institute for Politics and 
Strategy (IPS) will serve as 
a center for research, under-
graduate and graduate edu-
cation, and university-wide 
initiatives.

The Tartan Express food 
truck at Legacy Plaza was 
stamped with a notice by the 
Allegheny Health Inspector 
for health code violations last 
Thursday. Campus was abuzz 
with students’ rumors as to 
why the truck closed.
Ranging from the realis-
tic, to the completely absurd, 
students may not know which 
rumors are fact and which 
are ?ction. Health services 
can assure students that the 
violation was a small issue, of 
which even the vehicle’s op-
erator was unaware.
In an interview with The 
Tartan, Director of Dining 
Services Pascal Petter placed 
a small hose atop his desk. 
“[There] is a hose that’s un-
derneath the food truck which 
supplies water to the water 
tanks. This was kinked...
which didn’t allow us to have 
the correct amount of water 
pressure coming out of the 
sinks themselves,” Petter said.
The Allegheny County 
health inspector on the scene 
decided to close the truck 
Wednesday night, and left 
shortly thereafter. Carnegie 
Mellon Facility Management 
Services repaired the hose the 
same day, but the inspector 
was already gone. “As a follow 
up, I reached out to the same 
inspector on Thursday, to have 
him reinspect the truck that 
day, but I unfortunately did 
not hear back from him until 
late Thursday afternoon, as he 
was in the ?eld. He came out 
Friday, midday, to re-inspect 
the truck, which of course 
passed the inspection,” Petter 
said.
The only issue that the 
school’s food truck had with 
the health inspection was the 
hose itself. The truck opened 
back up on Friday afternoon, 
and its operators conducted 
business as usual, except they 
decided to work later than 
typical Friday hours. “We then 
opened up at 4 p.m. that same 
day, and saw an increased 
?ow of traf?c from students,” 
Petter said. Petter notes that 
this is evidence to students’ 
con?dence in the food truck’s 
ability to follow food safety re-
quirements.
The Tartan Express food 
truck itself is managed by 
the owners and operators of 
Lulu’s Noodles on Craig Street 
and Asiana in Newell Simon 
Hall.
As for the health safety 
concerns for the truck, the 
school oversees a majority of 
its vendors. “We do on a fairly 
regular basis have our own 
food safety inspection that 
we conduct at food locations. 
That is to support our ven-
dors; This is not to take place 
of Allegheny County Health 
Department regulations, or 
their inspections, it is to sup-
port our vendors’ food safety 
efforts and to ensure compli-
ance,” Petter said.
As for what students think, 
many are more concerned not 
with the truck’s food safety, 
but its food quality. “It always 
smells like instant ramen 
when you walk by the Tar-
tan Express,” junior business 
administration major Kenny 
Zheng said. Remarking on 
the food quality immediately 
prior to the close, sophomore 
physics major Marcel Legros 
said the food was “really salty, 
and too spicy for my tastes.” 
This is unrelated to the food 
truck’s food safety, and does 
not speak at all to its customer 
service, which the admin-
istration took into account 
when designating operational 
duties for the truck.
Carnegie Mellon’s Asiana 
restaurant has been on cam-
pus for almost a decade now, 
and its operators’ further im-
pact on campus seemed a logi-
cal step for dining services, as 
the organization wanted an 
Asian dining experience more 
centralized on campus. 
The inception of the food 
truck came about in the spring 
of 2014, after several meetings 
that Petter had with students 
revealed students’ overall de-
sire for more diversity in their 
food choices. Now, with the 
food truck, students do have a 
convenient and diverse choice 
of foods on campus; it just 
depends on which foods they 
want to eat.

Researchers study personal fabrication 
RAGHUNANDAN AVULA
Staffwriter
Imagine a world where 
we could make any object we 
wanted, almost instantly, any 
time. That is the bold future 
imagined by Stefanie Mueller, 
a PhD student at the Hasso 
Plattner Institute in Potsdam, 
Germany. Mueller shared 
her research in a stimulat-
ing lecture this past Friday at 
Carnegie Mellon. Her work 
is aimed at improving how 
people interact with personal 
fabrication devices such as 
3-D printers and laser cutters. 
She believes that through the 
development of more intuitive 
devices that provide quicker 
feedback to a user’s input, we 
may reach a point in the future 
where we can use the power of 
these machines to make any 
type of object we desire.
Recent years have seen 
a huge growth in accessibil-
ity to 3-D printers and simi-
lar personal fabrication de-
vices. According to Forbes, 
the market for 3-D printing 
grew to $4.1 billion, growing 
over $1 billion in 2014 alone. 
Mueller partially credits this 
immense recent growth to 
the expiration of 3-D printer 
patents. This allows others 
to use and further develop 
this technology. She said that 
many of these patents were 
established in the late 1980s 
and held by large companies. 
With new-found freedom, 
innovators have envisioned 
bringing this technology to 
the general public.
While many predictions 
point to continued, exponen-
tial growth for this market, 
Mueller warned us that we 
cannot ignore the possibil-
ity of an alternate future 
where this technology begins 
to grow, but then fades due 
to lack of accessibility to the 
general consumer. Currently, 
the majority of 3-D printing 
software is targeted toward 
industry professionals who 
have years and years of train-
ing. Even for skilled users, the 
interaction with the machine 
is not intuitive because users 
do not receive immediate re-
sponses to their input. This is 
mainly because modern ma-
chines are exceptionally slow 
and may have to be left over-
night to complete building an 
object.
Mueller compared the 
problems personalized fabri-
cation faces to the those faced 
by personal computing many 
decades ago. Early comput-
ers were very complicated 
to use: sometimes requir-
ing punching holes in cards, 
inserting them into the ma-
chine, and waiting overnight 
for the computer to compute 
the results. Since then, many 
of the problems have been 
addressed, as evidenced by 
the personal computers we 
carry around today. Mueller 
hopes that following a similar 
model, we will be able to el-
evate personalized fabrication 
technologies and make them 
ubiquitous.
The largest challenge to 
this goal, however, is how we 
will be able manipulate mat-
ter in a manner that is fast, 
reliable, and depicts the user’s 
vision for the object. Muel-
ler has focused much of her 
research on addressing this 
challenge, and she showed 
videos of her team’s develop-
ments during her talk. The 
?rst example was of a laser 
cutter that cuts a variety of 
materials from wood, card-
board, and plastics. A piece of 
glass separates the user from 
the laser and the material, but 
the user can use a variety of 
laser tools in the form of a pen 
to mark locations where the 
machine should cut or move. 
The user can almost act as if 
they are drawing using a pen 
on the glass and the machine 
will move, almost instantly, in 
response to their actions. This 
is an example of speeding up 
the feedback between user 
input and the visualization of 
the resulting changes.
Mueller and her team took 
this idea one step further, 
wanting to explore whether 
or not they could push their 
Ant colonies model the response of the nervous system 
This week, researchers 
from the University of Bristol, 
England published a study in 
the journal PLOS ONE that 
examined migrating ant colo-
nies’ collective responses to 
perceived threats. Research-
ers simulated predator at-
tacks by plucking certain ants 
from their environments. 
When researchers plucked 
“scout” ants from the colo-
ny’s periphery, the perceived 
threat caused the rest of the 
ants to pull back into the nest 
for safety. When worker ants 
were plucked from the nest 
itself, the colony ?ed and 
sought shelter elsewhere as a 
unit.
The authors believe their 
research suggests a parallel 
between the ants’ environ-
mental sensitivity and the 
nervous system of single or-
ganisms. They suggest that 
the nervous system responds 
to cell damage via pain just as 
ant colonies respond to colo-
nial damage, through group 
awareness. This new research 
could provide a new way 
of thinking about nervous 
system damage and repair.

Eyedrops with potential to treat cataracts created
Cataracts, a clouding of the 
clear lens within an eye, are the 
leading cause of blindness all 
over the world, affecting nearly 
20 million people worldwide. 
A team of researchers from 
the University of California 
San Francisco, the University 
of Michigan, and Washington 
University in St. Louis have 
identi?ed a compound which 
is soluble enough to constitute 
the basis of eye-drop medica-
tion for cataracts. Cataracts are 
usually removed with surgery, 
so an eye-drop form would be 
revolutionary for treatment 
the world over. The proposed 
eye-drops will function by pre-
venting maintenance proteins 
within the eye, crystallins, from 
clumping to form cataracts. 
Crystallins are an essential com-
ponent of the eye’s lens, tasked 
with maintaining the transpar-
ency and ?exibility of the lens’s 
?ber cells, the components of 
our eyes’ lenses. The research 
could also provide insight into 
the study of nervous system 
diseases such as Alzheimer’s, 
Parkinson’s, and Huntington’s 
diseases, which involve similar 
protein aggregates.

Uncovered Maya village Ceren yields social histories
In 1978, an El Salvadorian 
Maya village known as Ceren 
was discovered, preserved in 
amazingly precise condition 
by the ash cloud of a volcanic 
eruption that occurred ap-
proximately 1400 years prior.
Continuing studies of 
Ceren have allowed archae-
ologists to hypothesize about 
the social relationships be-
tween citizens. The shadows 
of villagers, left behind in 
garden footprints and ?nger 
swipes on pottery, as well as 
evidence of thatching, weav-
ing, and agricultural skills, 
have led to a colorful posthu-
mous image of this civiliza-
tion. Ceren appears to have 
been a free-range society, of-
fering “virtually no in?uence 
and certainly no control by 
the [Maya] elites.” It appears 
the only contact the indi-
viduals would have had with 
the Maya elite was in public 
marketplace transactions in 
El Salvador’s Zapotitan Val-
ley, and even this contact ap-
pears to have been  minimal 
and non-essential for most 
people.

Scientists discover multitude of uses for decaying wood
Dead wood is not dead 
weight. A living tree is one or-
ganism within a forest, but a 
dead tree is an ecosystem all 
its own, says Mark Harmon, 
a biologist at Oregon State 
University. While a living tree 
sustains only itself, a dead tree 
becomes a host for insects, 
fungi, bacteria, and many oth-
er living things. Harmon is one 
of several researchers who is 
helping with a 200-year-long 
study on the decomposition 
of trees. Their research shows 
that since logs take a long time 
to decompose, they create a 
stable living space for other 
organisms. The organisms aid 
in the tree’s decomposition 
process in many ways: beetles 
track fungal spores into the 
log’s interior, and the fungi 
grow and use the tough bits 
of the wood as sustenance. 
Decomposition depends not 
only on the kind of tree itself, 
but all of the other organisms 
which take up residents with-
in it. This research will allow 
forestry units to better under-
stand the work they do within 
forest ecosystems.

New research suggests babies are judgmental
Research supported by 
the National Science Founda-
tion’s Social, Behavioral, and 
Economic Sciences Director-
ate has shown that babies are 
judgmental. 
Babies have many differ-
ent sociological preferences. 
They have been observed to 
prefer people who look like 
them and who speak the same 
language. Babies tend to be 
drawn to social people, dislik-
ing those who are antisocial. 
There is also some evidence 
that babies can prefer people 
who mistreat others, so long 
as the mistreated individuals 
do not share the child’s food 
preferences. This suggests 
that babies behave with the 
mentality of “the enemy of my 
enemy is my friend.” 
This research shows that 
infants develop certain so-
cial biases early on, associat-
ing themselves with those 
with similar qualities and 
distancing themselves from 
those who are different. This 
research provides further 
insight into the way babies 
develop social skills.

Gene editing used in treatment of  leukemia
Doctors’ toolkits are ex-
panding into the molecular 
realm as gene splicing be-
comes practical treatment. 
Doctors from the Great Or-
mond Street Hospital in Lon-
don recently announced their 
use of modi?ed immune cells 
in treatment of a one year-old 
girl’s leukemia.
Using molecular surgery 
tools known as TALENs and 
CRISPRs, doctors are effec-
tively editing patients’ DNA. 
CRISPRs are RNA molecules 
which guide Cas9 enzymes 
to a certain spot on the DNA. 
The Cas9 then snips the DNA 
in that speci?c place. TALENs 
are enzymes which cut the 
DNA strands themselves. 
In the case of Layla, the 
one year-old child treated 
with this technology, re-
searchers used TALENs to 
engineer immune cells known 
as T cells, which were able 
to distinguish between her 
own body’s cells and invad-
ers. Since then she has had a 
bone-marrow transplant and 
is currently cancer free.

Atomic bombs use nuclear ?ssion  
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Staffwriter
Since the invention of 
gunpowder, chemical reac-
tions have fueled a plethora 
of weaponry. None, how-
ever, have exhibited effects 
as deadly or as lasting as 
the atomic bomb, which 
was used for the ?rst and 
only time during World War 
II when the United States 
dropped atomic bombs Little 
Boy and Fat Man on Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki, Japan, 
respectively. Although no 
atomic weapons have been 
used to date since, the threat 
they pose stems from their 
enormous chemical potency.
To start, we must under-
stand what an atom is and 
what it is made of. According 
Context aware apps recognize objects touched by user
NAVIYA SINGLA

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University, including 
Gierad Laput, a third-year 
doctoral student in human-
computer interaction, have 
developed a new technique, 
called EM-Sense, that can 
detect whether a person is 
in contact with an electrical 
or electromechanical object 
and then identify the object. 
This technique, when incor-
porated into smartwatches, 
could provide more informa-
tion about the user’s activi-
ties than current technology, 
thus making the user-experi-
ence more personalized and 
accurate.
The technology utilizes 
a sensor in your smart-
watch that detects the object 
that you are touching. The 
EM-Sense technology works 
on the principle that every 
electrical or electromechani-
cal object — for example 
iPads, electric toothbrushes, 
electric drills, and printers — 
emits electromagnetic noise, a 
unique signal in the radio fre-
quency range that can be used 
to uniquely identify an object. 
Different types of objects have 
unique electromagnetic sig-
natures, and when an object 
is touched, those signals ?ow 
through the body and can be 
picked up by the sensor in the 
smartwatch. The smartwatch 
is in contact with your skin, 
which detects and matches 
the signal to its speci?c ob-
ject. Although signals emitted 
by the same objects are the 
same, pairing mechanisms 
can be applied to differentiate 
between two objects of the 
same type. This technology 
can also be extended to large 
metallic objects like ladders. 
Being metallic, such objects 
absorb the electromagnetic 
noise from the other objects 
around them, which allows a 
unique signal to be detected 
by the watch when they are 
touched, depending on their 
surroundings.
The data obtained using 
this technology in a smart-
watch can be used to develop 
context-aware apps. Such an 
app would use the informa-
tion that it receives to plan 
out and suggest activities to 
the user. As demonstrated in 
a video released by Disney 
entitled, “EM-Sense: Touch 
Recognition of Uninstru-
mented Electrical and Elec-
tromechanical Objects,” the 
EM-Sense technology could 
be used to augment activities 
throughout the day. The 
video shows that the smart-
watch could record data 
when a user steps on a scale 
and display it in relation to 
previous data, or start a timer 
when the user begins using an 
electronic toothbrush, or re-
mind the user about appoint-
ments and meetings as soon 
as they touch the handle of 
the door to their of?ce. This 
technology could be future of 
smartwatches, making them 
smarter than ever.
When asked about the 
future plans for the project, 
Laput said, “[In the future], 
we’d be happy if giant manu-
facturers pick the project up. 
It’s a patent-pending project, 
so if a large company could 
integrate this into existing 
technology, we’d love to see 
it out there in the real world.”
As of now, the technology 
is limited to electromagnetic 
objects. The next step in the 
project is to detect objects 
that don’t emit electromag-
netic noise, like wooden, 
plastic, or cloth objects. The 
detection of objects that don’t 
emit electromagnetic noise 
is, in fact, the next research 
problem that Laput may be 
working on.
On collaborating with Dis-
ney, Laput said that “Disney is 
an awesome place. We are ba-
sically Imagineers, so we just 
imagine. We ?gure out cool 
things that can enhance peo-
ple’s experiences. And I think 
that’s a very fun agenda.”
Along with Gierad Laput, 
the research team is com-
prised of Alanson Sample, a 
research scientist at Disney; 
Jack Yang, also from Disney; 
Chris Harrison, assistant pro-
fessor of human-computer 
interaction; and Robert Xiao, 
a Ph.D. student in HCII. The 
researchers discussed the 
EM-Sense technology at the 
User Interface Software and 
Technology Symposium, 
which was hosted in Char-
lotte, North Carolina on Nov. 
8–11, at which the research 
team’s talk won the “Best Talk 
Award.” “We did live demos 
and people really enjoyed it. 
People loved it,” Laput said.
As technology becomes a 
larger part of human life, the 
study of human-computer 
interaction becomes increas-
ingly relevant and important. 
Laput emphasized this im-
portance of research in this 
area, saying that researchers 
today are beginning to under-
stand that “focusing on the 
human as opposed to just fo-
cusing just on the algorithms 
is actually a problem worth 
solving.”

to atomic theory, an atom is 
the most basic unit of a chemi-
cal element. All of the matter 
around us is composed of at-
oms, each of which are made 
of up protons, neutrons, and 
electrons. Within an atom, 
protons and neutrons sit at 
the center in a ball called the 
nucleus, and electrons or-
bit around this nucleus in an 
electron cloud. The attractive 
bonds between the positive 
charge of the protons and the 
negative charge of the elec-
trons are what provide the en-
ergy to hold an atom together; 
neutrons exhibit no charge 
and merely contribute mass to 
the atom.
Despite how trivial this 
atomic model may seem now, 
during the 20th century it 
was new to scientists. Once 
this model was discovered, 
though, scientists began 
experimenting with the atom 
to determine if its nuclear en-
ergy could be harnessed. It 
wasn’t until 1938, when scien-
tists Otto Hahn and Fritz Stras-
smann split an atom through a 
process called nuclear ?ssion, 
that the atomic bomb became 
a real possibility.
During nuclear ?ssion, a 
single atom of a given element 
splits into two or more smaller 
daughter atoms of new ele-
ments; for example, a urani-
um atom can split into krypton 
and barium atoms. Because 
splitting an atom causes its in-
ner attractive bonds to break, 
some of the chemical energy 
stored in them gets released. 
Additionally, although the 
number of protons and elec-
trons doesn’t change between 
mother atom and daughter 
atoms, during nuclear ?ssion 
a few neutrons shoot out and 
are lost from the mother atom.
The ejection of these 
neutrons is crucial for an 
atomic bomb powered by 
nuclear ?ssion. When design-
ing an atomic ?ssion bomb, 
scientists use elements like 
uranium which have unstable 
atomic properties, making it 
dif?cult for atoms of that ele-
ment to hold themselves to-
gether. Due to this instability, 
a uranium atom only needs a 
small aggravation to undergo 
nuclear ?ssion and form more 
stable daughter atoms. In the 
process of doing so, however, 
this single uranium atom 
ejects several neutrons, each 
of which in turn collides with 
other unstable uranium atoms 
and causes these atoms to un-
dergo nuclear ?ssion.
The result is a cascading 
chain reaction of uranium 
atoms splitting, with each 
successive chain generating 
a greater number of ejected 
neutrons and thus a greater 
number of uranium atoms 
splitting apart. Each of these 
?ssion reactions releases a 
discrete amount of energy, 
which accumulates to deliver 
an explosion equivalent to, 
in the case of Fat Man, thirty 
two million pounds of TNT. In 
order for the chain reaction 
to sustain itself and gener-
ate an amount of energy this 
large, there must be a mini-
mum mass of uranium present 
called the critical mass; if the 
critical mass of uranium is not 
present in an explosion, not 
enough neutrons will be eject-
ed by uranium atoms, and the 
cascade will ?zzle.
One of the dangers with ac-
cumulating the critical mass 
of an unstable element such 
as uranium is that with more 
mass present, there is higher 
chance of a single atom be-
ing aggravated and sponta-
neously initiating premature 
detonation. During World War 
II, scientists circumvented this 
issue by engineering a vessel 
that could hold two subcriti-
cal masses of uranium apart 
from each other, decreasing 
the likelihood of an atomic ex-
plosion being spontaneously 
triggered.
In order to ensure that 
these subcritical masses come 
together and have an appro-
priate amount of time to re-
act, scientists place explosives 
behind one of the masses that 
will detonate based on a pres-
sure sensor. The sensor is 
designed such that when an 
atomic bomb is dropped from 
a high altitude, the sensor will 
trigger the explosives once it 
reads an atmospheric pressure 
corresponding to the altitude 
above the ground required for 
optimal uranium detonation.
The atomic bomb was the 
?rst nuclear weapon scien-
tists and engineers developed 
and, since World War II, more 
powerful bombs such as the 
hydrogen bomb have emerged. 
Although they rely on different 
mechanisms, they still follow 
the same recipe of extracting 
nuclear energy from atoms.
Thankfully, atomic energy 
has evolved to be used in more 
peaceful applications, such as 
power generation via nuclear 
reactors, but the discovery of 
nuclear energy is rooted in 
the development of a weapon 
of mass destruction. With the 
proliferation of atomic weap-
ons in the world today, it is 
easy to glance over the devas-
tating impact an atomic bomb 
can have on a region; Hiro-
shima and Nagasaki are still 
recovering today from atomic 
explosions that occurred near-
ly seventy years ago. Under-
standing the sheer power and 
severity of using one of these 
weapons can lead to more 
educated decisions concerning 
nuclear warfare policy both in 
America and abroad.
Atomic bombs embody unique application of atomic energy
Laurence Ales gives lecture on automation and job loss
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Staffwriter
Continuing our discussion 
from last week about tech-
nical automation, Pugwash 
heard from Laurence Ales, an 
assistant professor of econom-
ics at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, regarding the effects of 
automation on job loss.
Ales began his talk by lay-
ing out two stories that are of-
ten told by the media regard-
ing automation. The ?rst is 
that modern automation will 
take all our jobs as humans 
become obsolete in compari-
son to robots. The second is 
that although the market has 
responded to automation in 
the past, this time is different.
After putting the two me-
dia narratives on the table for 
us to think about, Ales gave 
a brief history of past tech-
nological changes and their 
impacts on the market. Tech-
nological change has been 
happening throughout hu-
man history, moving the labor 
force from artisans, to factory 
laborers, to service workers. 
At each transition, some jobs 
were lost, but other positions 
opened up to replace them.
Looking at the ?rst con-
cern that arises, regarding the 
idea of humans becoming ob-
solete or running out of jobs, 
Ales cautioned us to not only 
look at jobs lost, but also jobs 
gained.
If autonomous vehicles or 
drones take over the trans-
portation and delivery sec-
tors, then of course people 
who are currently deliver-
ing pizzas will be out of jobs. 
However, that’s just the ?rst 
step. If robots provide such 
an advantage, pizza might get 
cheaper, encouraging more 
people to buy it. This necessi-
tates more pizza cooks, more 
receptionists to take orders, 
and more managers to orga-
nize it all. Similarly, it means 
more drones doing delivery, 
which could mean a drone 
repair shop opening up down 
the street.
Although automation re-
duces some jobs, Ales wanted 
to make it clear that it will 
open up new opportunities 
in other areas. Humans will 
always have a competitive 
advantage in something, 
relative to machines or robots, 
and those areas are where 
jobs will open up.
The second concern, how-
ever, is that modern automa-
tion is somehow different 
from automation in the past. 
Maybe it’s the pace of the au-
tomation, or which jobs are 
being replaced, or even who’s 
making how much money.
It’s true, Ales said, that the 
jobs being replaced now, or 
the jobs that will be replaced 
in the near future, are differ-
ent than prior jobs. The last 
major industrial shift saw a 
decline in factory laborers due 
to a transition towards service 
jobs, and now it’s those ser-
vice jobs, among other indus-
tries like transportation, that 
are being targeted.
Despite the prevalence of 
technology, however, there 
are still plenty of areas in 
which humans have an advan-
tage over machines. Maybe 
they can deliver pizzas and 
drive cars, but they still don’t 
make very good janitors or 
economics professors. And 
the robots in use aren’t being 
repaired by other robots, or at 
least not yet.
In looking at inequal-
ity, Ales thinks there might 
be something to worry about. 
The wealth gap has been in-
creasing since the 1970s. This 
is possibly due in part to the 
fact that the jobs being re-
placed are mid-level jobs in-
volving semi-skilled work, and 
the new jobs being created are 
on either end of the spectrum.
Ales next addressed the 
question of policy. If automa-
tion takes away some jobs, 
while at the same time open-
ing up new ones, and the 
wealth gap is increasing, what 
are some policy solutions that 
could address these issues?
First, to help workers who 
are in danger of being re-
placed, we should make it 
easier to transfer from one 
sector to another. Find which 
industries are losing jobs, and 
provide incentive for workers 
to switch to similar industries 
that aren’t being replaced. At 
the same time, make sure to 
support people who want to 
go into careers that are see-
ing growth. Easing transitions 
from one career to another 
would make workers more 
agile and able to respond to 
automation.

technology from 2-D actions 
to 3-D actions. Using tech-
niques and ideas from origa-
mi, they developed a machine 
that, instead of cutting at a 
desired position, would gen-
erate a fold of a speci?c angle 
or design. The laser would 
heat the material to a point 
where it would bend with the 
force of gravity but not break. 
Mueller showed an impres-
sive video of a user making a 
plastic pot within minutes us-
ing technology created by her 
team.
In a separate realm of her 
research, Mueller and her 
team focused on improving 
the user experience with 3-D 
printers. One current problem 
with 3-D printers is that a user 
can use software to model 
his design, but a 3-D printer 
must work overnight or for 
a few hours before a product 
is produced. Thus, the user 
must envision the impact of 
any desired changes ahead of 
time. To speed up this feed-
back loop, the team invented 
a method of printing a wire-
frame model based on the ac-
tual object the user wants to 
create.
Wire-frame objects are 
veritable skeletons, like a 
structural model of the object 
itself. The wire-frame technol-
ogy required the development 
of a new method of dispensing 
the plastic in a vertical fashion 
without the plastic bending 
over itself. Mueller showed a 
video of a construction of the 
wire-frame model of a bottle 
whose creation took only 14 
minutes, compared to over 
three hours for the complete 
model. With this model, the 
user can see the results of the 
changes he wants to make 
more quickly, which shortens 
the feedback loop.
These technologies are 
still developing, but Mueller 
encouraged her crowd that 
by improving these personal 
fabrication technologies us-
ing the approaches her team 
has devised, we may even-
tually approach a future of 
instant fabrication. Another 
area of Mueller’s research is 
to explore ways of improving 
sustainability, because an in-
evitable impact of instant fab-
rication is an increase in the 
number of objects produced 
and the amount of materi-
als that become discarded as 
trash. If a 3-D printed object 
breaks or becomes outdated, 
a user would just throw out 
the old object and print a new 
one. The team’s idea involves 
scanning a 3-D object, and us-
ing computer software to in-
struct the 3-D printer to mod-
ify the existing object.
Mueller showed an exam-
ple of a 3-D printed phone case 
that could no longer be used, 
since the user bought the new 
model of the phone. Using the 
3-D printer, she scanned the 
phone case, instructed the 
printer to make design chang-
es relevant to the new model, 
and was able to transform 
her old unusable object into a 
modi?ed, relevant object.
The potential of the ap-
proaches Mueller explained 
and depicted in her research 
could lead to an evolution of 
technology that revamps the 
way we use personal fabrica-
tion technologies, ultimately 
changing the way we cre-
ate and interact with objects 
around us.
FABRICATION, from A5Personal fabrication has uncertain future
Secondly, Ales argued 
that to address the income 
disparity, taxes should be 
raised on the wealthy in-
stead of raising the minimum 
wage. Providing a higher 
minimum income would only 
encourage workers to stay 
in dying industries, accord-
ing to Ales. Instead of doing 
that, the government should 
tax the wealthy and use that 
money to provide re-training 
for workers to ?nd an indus-
try that is growing instead of 
shrinking.
The talk by Ales was fol-
lowed by a question and an-
swer session. One question 
that came up was while 
Ales’ talk applied mostly to 
the United States and other 
developed countries, what 
about nations like Mexico 
or China? Also, what would 
happen when robots even-
tually have all competitive 
advantage over humans? Per-
haps most importantly, will 
economists’ policy advice be 
heeded by those in charge?
While Ales had some an-
swers, other questions are 
still up for grabs. “Get back 
to me in a year,” he laughed 
when asked about his current 
research. However, Ales was 
clear that as far as we know, 
the current wave of automa-
tion doesn’t mean the end of 
the world as we know it, as 
many claim.

It’s of?cial: Starbucks has de-
clared war on Hanukkah. Every No-
vember, Starbucks decides to spruce 
up its various warm beverages with 
fun cup designs in the holiday spirit. 
This year’s cups have created the is-
sue at hand — they are completely 
red.
Red — while appropriate for 
winter holidays such as Christmas, 
Kwanzaa, and Diwali — does not in 
any way ?t into the blue and white 
color scheme of Hanukkah. Star-
bucks is deliberately ignoring the 
Jewish community and disrespect-
ing the memory of the Maccabees, 
the heroes of the Hanukkah tale.
To combat this obvious hatred of 
my beloved holiday, I have come up 
with a way to force the Festival of 
Lights to get the recognition on Star-
bucks coffee cups that it deserves. I 
am going to visit my local Starbucks 
with a bucket of blue paint, buy a 
drink, and then force my barista to 
paint the cup blue for me. My cup 
covered in wet blue paint will serve 
as a reminder that we cannot stand 
idly by in the face of hatred; we must 
?ght to have our voices heard. 
Obviously, this plan of mine has 
a few major ?aws. For one, having 
cans of blue paint in places where 
foods and drinks are being made 
is de?nitely against health code. 
Furthermore, Starbucks is a corpo-
ration that does not care about my 
outrage as long as I am still purchas-
ing its beverages. Finally, and most 
importantly, it is absolutely ridicu-
lous to call a red coffee cup a symbol 
of hatred against the holidays.
Nonetheless, conversations 
about these coffee cups have ?lled 
the news ever since Starbucks re-
leased their new cup design last 
week. While in previous years, the 
Starbucks holiday cup has featured 
winking snowmen, sledding scenes, 
snow?akes, tree ornaments, and 
words such as “wish” and “hope,” 
this year Starbucks has dialed it 
back, creating a mininalist cup with 
a two-tone red background and the 
Starbucks logo. “Starbucks is in-
viting their customers to tell their 
Christmas stories in their own way, 
with a red cup that mimics a blank 
canvas,’’ the company said in a state-
ment to TODAY.
This change of design has sent 
self-proclaimed evangelist and In-
ternet personality Joshua Feuerstein 
into a frenzy. On Nov. 5, Feuerstein 
posted a video on his Facebook page 
to his over 1.8 million followers ex-
pressing his outrage over the cup de-
sign that does not feature any holi-
day imagery.
“Do you realize that Starbucks 
wanted to take Christ and Christmas 
off of their brand new cups? That’s 
why they’re just plain red,” Feuer-
stein proclaimed in his video. “When 
I went in, I asked for my coffee, 
they asked for my name, and I told 
them my name is Merry Christmas. 
So guess what, Starbucks, I tricked 
you into putting Merry Christmas 
on your cup.” Feuerstein went on 
to challenge Christians across the 
country to do the same, and to share 
the video with friends to spread the 
word. The video has over 180,000 
likes and has been shared over 
500,000 times.
Since then, social media has been 
blowing up with both agreement 
and outrage. Some have carried out 
their own versions of Feuerstein’s 
protest, posting coffee sel?es and 
praising companies such as Dunkin’ 
Donuts, whose holiday coffee cups 
this year feature a design that says 
“Joy,” surrounded by holly and 
snow?akes.
 Many others have denounced 
his claims, some even creating their 
own designs of the Starbucks cup 
to mock the controversy, including 
Stephen Colbert’s cup idea that fea-
tures a nativity scene glued to the 
top, a small tree attached to the bot-
tom, and tinsel streaming down the 
sides. Presidential candidate Donald 
Trump has even weighed in on the 
issue at his recent rally in Spring-
?eld, Illinois, declaring, “I have one 
of the most successful Starbucks 
in Trump Tower. Maybe we should 
boycott Starbucks? I don’t know.… 
By the way, that’s the end of that 
lease, but who cares.”
Let’s take a step back for a mo-
ment and realize what we are ?ght-
ing about here: We are talking about 
a plain red coffee cup. This is no anti-
Christmas propaganda, and, for the 
record, none of Starbucks’ former 
holiday cups said “Merry Christmas” 
in the ?rst place, opting instead for 
generic, winter-themed designs. 
With the abundance of Christmas 
decorations and merchandise that 
line almost every post-Halloween 
retail center in America, there is no 
lack of Christmas spirit.
Starbucks itself sells a Christmas 
Blend coffee, along with Christmas-
themed merchandise. Christmas 
is so oversaturated in society that 
companies have to actively try to 
reach out to non-Christians, either 
through fully inclusive or generic 
winter-themed decoration. There 
have never been stories of Starbucks’ 
Hindu patrons being angry about 
the lack of Diwali spirit, or Jewish 
patrons demanding a menorah with 
their latte. There is no absence of 
Christmas to complain about.
Furthermore, instead of being 
outraged over a design on a coffee 
cup, let’s realize how lucky we are 
to be able to afford $4 coffee in the 
?rst place. I am sure that the mil-
lions of people in this country that 
struggle to put food on the table ev-
ery day do not care about what is on 
the packaging of that food. We are 
lucky enough to be able to spend 
money on luxuries such as coffee, 
but instead of being thankful, we are 
caught up in completely arbitrary 
debates about hurt feelings and pa-
per cups.
So, to those that are offended by 
the lack of Christmas spirit on your 
Starbucks coffee cup: Go ahead and 
take a stand by ordering your drink 
and making your barista write “Mer-
ry Christmas” on your cup. Just re-
member that those words are about 
as useful as a coat of blue paint. In 
the end, it will get thrown out with 
the rest of your coffee cup; it will 
do little to improve the day of your 
barista; it will make no real impact 
on society; and Starbucks will be 
happily receiving your money re-
gardless.

Recent research on the preva-
lence of attention-de?cit/hyperactiv-
ity disorder, or ADHD, has suggested 
that the disorder goes undiagnosed 
even more than was previously sug-
gested, according to an article in The 
New York Times this week.
The writer of the article, Kath-
erine Ellison points out that in the 
midst of rising rates of diagnosis, 
there is a distinctive lack of under-
standing that is not rising at the rate 
that it should be. Ellison writes that 
“While global diagnoses of ADHD 
are on the rise, public understand-
ing of the disorder has not kept pace. 
Debates about the validity of the di-
agnosis and the drugs used to treat 
it — the same that have long polar-
ized Americans — are now playing 
out from Northern and Eastern Eu-
rope to the Middle East and South 
America.” According to Ellison, glob-
al stigmas are often crippling to the 
children who suffer through these 
disorders, and the stigma extends to 
the medication that could help them 
to cope. She emphasizes, however, 
that this isn’t a new phenomenon.
The skepticism surrounding pop-
ular medications that help kids with 
ADHD to focus is rampant, and only 
continues to be exacerbated by the 
abuse of the same drugs by the peers 
of the children who need it. A recent 
study by Gustavus Adolphus College 
reported that it is likely that one in 
seven college students will abuse 
Adderall, Ritalin, or another ADHD-
treating drug during their time at 
school, and these rates are continu-
ously rising, prompting many to 
question the merits of these drugs.
Even, or perhaps especially, at 
Carnegie Mellon, the discussion 
revolves around the medication’s 
abusers rather than its intended use 
in helping those who need it. With 
rates of ADHD diagnoses on the rise, 
it is more important than ever that 
this stigma be struck down. ADHD is 
not a joke or a reason to pop a pill, 
but a serious disorder that can crip-
ple students’ potential and inhibit 
academic progress.
The medication that can help to 
these students to overcome their 
disorder and do great things is con-
sidered by others to be the start to a 
good night out or a reason to put off 
a paper until the night before, and 
these con?icting purposes hurt the 
reputation of the medication. There 
is no shame in taking these medica-
tions if they are prescribed to you, 
but rampant abuse has made it so 
that even those with ADHD cannot 
admit to having the medication with-
out fear of stigmatization or worse, 
having their pills stolen from them.
At Carnegie Mellon, great minds 
work hard every day to solve prob-
lems and ?nd solutions. There is no 
place on this campus for stigmatiza-
tion of any kind, but especially not of 
our peers. Rather than shaming them 
for the medication that they take 
legitimately, we should hold those 
who abuse the medication account-
able while celebrating those who are 
more than just their disorder. 
Instead of cultivating an envi-
ronment of shame and secrecy, we 
should bring the discussion of this 
disorder and the misconceptions of 
it out into the open to lay the foun-
dation for an open, productive con-
versation that re?ects the intelli-
gent, caring community of Carnegie 
Mellon University.
Focus on drug abuse creates stigma about ADHD

Students deserve dependably safe food on campus
The popular Tartan Express Food 
Truck that is usually situated in Leg-
acy Plaza outside of the Cohon Uni-
versity Center (CC) was shut down 
for a health code violation last week, 
prompting the Tartan to talk to Pas-
cal Petter, the Director of Dining 
Services.
Director of Marketing for Student 
Affairs Operations Mandi Semple 
commented in the “To Dining With 
Love” Facebook group, saying “The 
Allegheny County Health Depart-
ment has temporarily suspended the 
permit to operate the Tartan Express, 
due to a water pressure issue on the 
truck. Once the water pressure is 
?xed, the truck will be re-inspected 
and back in operation in the very 
near future. Food service safety is a 
top priority at Carnegie Mellon. We 
are working to resolve the issues im-
mediately and apologize for this in-
convenience to the community.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
reports that the food truck did not 
have running water, prompting the 
shutdown. “No one in the vehicle is 
able to wash hands when beginning 
new tasks, after handling money or 
touching the face or hair,” a health 
inspector wrote.
The problems, however, went be-
yond that. “Other violations includ-
ed holding food at unsafe tempera-
tures and inadequate sanitization,” 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette wrote. 
The full health inspection report 
can be viewed online, and includes 
violations such as employee per-
sonal hygiene, cleaning and sanita-
tion, water supply, and cold holding 
temperature. Although the truck has 
since been re-inspected and has re-
opened, the closure of the food truck 
prompted many students to consider 
the cleanliness of the truck and, even 
further, of all of the dining facilities 
on campus. 
Since Petter has taken over 
Dining Services at Carnegie Mel-
lon, students and faculty have seen 
a marked improvement in the com-
munication between the adminis-
tration and students regarding on-
campus dining, the “To Dining With 
Love” Facebook page being one no-
table example.
However, on the Facebook page, 
students frequently post concerns 
and questions regarding the safety 
of the food that they eat, ranging 
from hummus at Entropy+ that has 
remained on the shelf despite its 
long-past expiration date to chicken 
found in a serving of vegetarian 
soup. While the staff of Dining Ser-
vices does a fast and ef?cient job of 
addressing these concerns, it leads 
to questions about the bigger picture 
of food health and safety at Carn-
egie Mellon. The university should 
be meeting the minimum standards 
of food health inspections while 
serving quality food, and students 
should not have to worry about the 
sanitation of the dining places they 
frequent.

Platforms worth more than purses, women worth more than beauty
EMILY GALLAGHER
Junior Staffwriter
According to the Merriam-Web-
ster Dictionary, there are three de?-
nitions of the word “beauty:” ?rst, 
the quality of being physically attrac-
tive; second, the qualities in a per-
son or a thing that give pleasure to 
the senses or the mind; and ?nally, a 
beautiful woman.
There has long been a disparity 
in how the idea and expectation of 
beauty is applied to women com-
pared to men. A “beauty” is a wom-
an; a man can be beautiful, but the 
nature of the word does not expect or 
require a man to be so. As children, 
we are taught not to judge a book by 
its cover and that what’s on the in-
side counts. But this is not what soci-
ety teaches, especially when it comes 
to women.
It’s undeniable that women of all 
ages face pressure to appear younger, 
prettier, and more sexually appeal-
ing. It is a message that’s pounded 
into our heads with every magazine 
advertisement, TV commercial, and 
Miss America pageant. It is a mes-
sage that holds tremendous poten-
tial to shatter a woman’s con?dence 
and comfort in her own skin, and it 
is a message that long ago should 
have been deemed backward and 
obsolete. Yet, it is a message that still 
persists everywhere.
It is no secret that there are seri-
ous presidential candidates who are 
women, but what I ?nd extremely 
unsettling is the unjust treatment 
and criticism these women receive 
for their appearances and fashion 
choices.
 Why should it matter what Hill-
ary Clinton’s hair looks like or that 
Carly Fiorina wore 3 and 1/2 inch 
heels for a three-hour debate? It’s 
not wrong to dress in classy and ap-
pealing way, but the issue is that no-
body is writing pages-long articles 
about the price and designer of Jeb 
Bush’s suit.
It is inappropriate to discuss 
physical appearances in politics, 
where such things are so far from 
what should be the focus, and it’s 
especially problematic that such a 
dichotomy exists between male and 
female politicians. 
Judging a woman on her clothes 
or makeup is so shallow that it in-
validates and lessens how seriously a 
female candidate may be considered. 
Even as women’s rights have in-
creased, we still keep returning to 
mindsets of the past. We can never 
move forward in any real way until 
we let go of these former societal 
standards.
This is a hard and complex time 
for women, which is something that 
is often dismissed due to tremendous 
steps forward in gender equality. 
The biggest fault in our society is the 
double standard that women face. A 
woman is supposed to be strong and 
independent and monetarily support 
her family in the same way that her 
husband does, but at the same time 
she is held to the role of caretaker, 
homemaker, and beautifully charm-
ing wife. To be just one or the other 
is often viewed as some kind of fault. 
No matter what new gender equality 
bills are passed or laws are imple-
mented, no one can justi?ably argue 
that men and women are viewed 
equally in America. 
The day that men and women are 
equal will be the day when a wom-
an is not judged by the brands she 
wears, the style of her hair, or the 
role she plays in her family. We are 
getting closer, but we are not there 
yet.
Our enemies are theirs: Answer to Paris isn’t Islamophobia 
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
As I’m writing this, over 130 civil-
ians have been con?rmed dead, with 
an additional 300 wounded, after or-
ganized terrorist attacks on Paris this 
Friday night. Bodies are still being 
counted and identi?ed. Thousands of 
Parisians, unsure of their friends’ and 
family’s safety, still fear the worst. 
Paris has experienced its worst catas-
trophe since the Second World War, 
and the Islamic State (IS or ISIS) has 
staged a terrorist attack of unprec-
edented scale and scope. The whole 
world is reeling. As I mourn for Paris, 
I also fear the impact of this attack on 
more than 4 million Syrian refugees 
and 1.6 billion Muslims across the 
planet.
After a night of celebratory social 
media posts from ISIS members and 
sympathizers, the extremist group of-
?cially declared responsibility for the 
attacks in a statement released Sat-
urday morning. The group claimed 
that the main sites of carnage were 
speci?cally targeted: popular rock 
venue the Bataclan, “where hun-
dreds of idolaters were together in 
a party of perversity;” the Stade de 
France, where “the imbecile” French 
President Francois Hollande was at-
tending a soccer match; as well as the 
streets of several bustling restaurant 
districts. With its tough stance on 
terrorism and often Islamophobic 
rhetoric, France has long been at the 
center of the jihadist group’s hatred 
of the West. 
“France and those who follow its 
path must know that they remain the 
principal targets of the Islamic State,” 
said the statement, claiming that the 
attacks were in retaliation for French 
airstrikes against jihadist strongholds 
in Syria and Iraq.
The attacks were completed by 
eight men, each equipped with ma-
chine guns and explosive belts, who 
were all killed by the end of the night 
— the majority by their own suicide 
blasts, a couple by law enforcement 
of?cers. Though these terrorists have 
been apprehended, they are hardly 
the “lone wolf” attackers on the inter-
national stage that ISIS has encour-
aged in the past. 
These attacks were coordinated 
and technologically ?uent, a care-
fully orchestrated joint effort be-
tween ISIS leaders in Syria and Iraq 
and insider extremists in France. If 
ISIS is indeed responsible for the at-
tacks, which has yet to be con?rmed 
by French government investigators, 
the group’s power has expanded 
more quickly and broadly than West-
ern leaders ever anticipated.
The aftershocks are already shap-
ing up to be massive. President Hol-
lande called the attacks an “act of 
war” by ISIS, justi?ably yet ominously 
promising “unforgiving retaliation.” 
Barack Obama has offered America’s 
assistance in what he referred to it as 
“an attack on all humanity and the 
universal values we share.” American 
presidential hopefuls on either side 
of the party line have chimed in with 
both sympathy and distasteful politi-
cizing of the tragedy. 
As usual, politicians are jumping 
at the opportunity to build a plat-
form out of bodies not yet cold. Both 
the American and European Right 
is pointing ?ngers at France’s strict 
gun control policy, which presum-
ably left civilians defenseless, and its 
loose border control, which allowed a 
distant enemy to become the enemy 
within.
Poland has already backed out 
of the European Union’s plan to re-
settle throughout its member states 
120,000 refugees from Syria, Iraq, 
and neighboring war-torn countries; 
other nations, especially in fairly ho-
mogenous Eastern Europe, will likely 
follow Poland’s example. In too many 
people’s minds, a toxic mixture of xe-
nophobia, racism, and Islamophobia 
has equated Syrian refugees — along 
with millions of peaceful Muslims —
with a few thousand jihadist extrem-
ists from ISIS and al Qaeda. We can 
only expect more pogroms, burning 
of mosques, and anti-Muslim dis-
crimination.
This is victim blaming at its worst. 
Just like the Parisians, Syrian refu-
gees have experienced ?rst-hand 
the violence and destruction of ISIS. 
They did not willingly leave their 
homeland to “in?ltrate” Europe; 
they were driven from it by ISIS, as 
much their enemy as ours. Persecut-
ing them for jihadist brutalities is the 
equivalent of arresting a black pastor 
for the actions of the Ku Klux Klan. 
As Obama has stated, and virtually 
every major Muslim organization has 
vehemently asserted, the “Islamic 
State” is neither a state nor true to 
the principles of Islam.
In light of this, an increasing num-
ber of world leaders — including 
President Hollande and U.S. Secre-
tary of State John Kerry — are aban-
doning use of the group’s chosen 
name altogether. Its alternative title 
is “Daesh,” a derogatory term that 
translates in Arabic to either “tram-
ple down and crush” or “bigot.” ISIS 
hates it, reportedly threatening to cut 
the tongues out of any mouth that 
utters it. According to Arabic transla-
tor Alice Guthrie, “They hear it, quite 
rightly, as a challenge to their legiti-
macy: a dismissal of their aspirations 
to de?ne Islamic practice, to be ‘a 
state for all Muslims’ and — crucially 
— as a refusal to acknowledge and 
address them as such.” Because the 
group is illegitimate, a desecration 
of Islam, I choose to refer to them as 
Daesh from here forward.
Now is the time to ?nd compas-
sion for all victims of extremism, 
both the Parisians and the Syrian 
refugees who will be an international 
scapegoat for their deaths. Beyond 
that, closing borders and hearts to 
Muslims plays directly into jihadist 
hands. Daesh’s main method of re-
cruitment is Western Islamophobia. 
They want to turn the West against 
Muslims. They want to point to the 
West and say, “See, they do hate 
you;” there is no better way to grow 
their ranks and, eventually, incite an 
all-out global con?ict.
What happened in Paris this 
weekend should be too horrible to 
conceive. It’s horrible how numb 
the world has grown, how callously 
politicians and journalists build their 
platforms and think pieces on some-
one else’s nightmare. But we must 
continue to ?ght against the worst 
tragedy of all: turning our backs on 
the victims and calling them the 
enemy.

“P.O.C.” fails as umbrella 
term in Mizzou protests 
SATVIKA NETI
In recent weeks, the University of 
Missouri, more popularly known as 
Mizzou, has been shaken by protests 
surrounding the administration’s 
mistreatment of black students and 
failure to provide a safe space. These 
protests won a resignation from 
Mizzou’s university president and 
school chancellor and spread to col-
leges across the country, including 
Yale University, Ithaca University, 
and Claremont-McKenna. However, 
last Monday’s backlash against the 
Mizzou protests — including racial 
slurs, vandalism, and even anony-
mous death threats on YikYak — has 
been a harsh reminder for black col-
lege students of the pervasiveness of 
racism on campuses everywhere.
As the protests continued, and 
Mizzou’s administration continued 
to not do enough to stop the perpe-
trators, many students nationwide 
started posting Facebook statuses 
such as: “To the students of color at 
Mizzou and many other institutions 
across the country: I, a student of 
color at Carnegie Mellon University, 
stand with you in solidarity. To those 
who would threaten their sense of 
safety, we are watching. You are not 
alone.

TARTANS TALK
Compiled by Sarah Gutekunst
The Tartan is excited to jam at the Fall Concert this week. So we asked,
What would you name your hypothetical band?
SINEAD FOLEY
How do you think you pronounce 
my name? If you are like 90 percent 
of the teachers I’ve had in my life, you 
were wrong. My name, Gaelic in ori-
gin, is one of those that needs some 
extra clari?cation. It was recently 
pointed out to me that having such 
an odd name must have shaped the 
person I grew into. As odd as it is to 
think, the labels assigned to us when 
we are tiny womb aliens guide us to 
who we are.
Statistically, names can shape 
people’s employment opportunities 
and school performance. Way back 
in 1948, a study examined the ef-
fect of names on Harvard students’ 
performance. They found that men 
with unusual names were more likely 
to ?unk out or to manifest neuroses 
than men with common names.
As the discipline of statistics has 
improved, similar studies have fo-
cused on people’s cultural and racial 
associations with names. A 2004 
study by Marianne Bartrand and 
Sendhil Mullainathan sent out two 
resumes with identical quali?cations 
and different names, one “white 
sounding” and one “black sounding.” 
The study found that candidates with 
“white” names received 50 percent 
more requests for interviews. This 
demonstrates racial discrimination in 
hiring processes that, while probably 
unconscious, can have a huge effect 
on individuals’ lives. Studies have 
also found that teachers expect less 
of children with “black” names, who 
therefore underperform. 
Gender also plays a role in how 
names affect people. Research in 
Florida schools has found that boys 
with names that are more com-
mon among girls, such as “Audrey” 
or “Lindsey,” have more behavioral 
problems once they reach puberty. 
“Once these kids hit sixth grade, all 
of a sudden the rates of disciplin-
ary problems skyrocket [for those 
boys with ‘girlish’ names], and it was 
much more the case if there hap-
pened to be a girl in the grade with 
that same name,” said the head re-
searcher on the study. This news 
probably doesn’t come as a surprise 
to anyone who’s lived through mid-
dle school. Children can be mean. An 
unusual name is often just one more 
thing for bullies to make fun of, driv-
ing certain children to the bottom of 
the social hierarchy.
It’s no wonder that many young 
adults opt to change their names. 
Recently, a friend of mine decided 
to change his Asian-sounding name, 
which was tied to his family and cul-
ture, to something more white upper-
middle class. I’ve met many people 
around campus who have anglicized 
their names for convenience, to avoid 
the awkward dance that happens ev-
ery time you introduce yourself and 
having to repeat your name three 
times before giving up and settling. 
A traditionally “white” name can get 
people places socioeconomically, so 
it’s tempting to make the switch.
However, I would argue for stand-
ing by unusual names. While my 
name doesn’t have strong racial con-
notations, it certainly stands out. 
This has been formative for me be-
cause it means I can’t hide, even if I 
want to. So, I’ve learned how to stand 
out and make the most of it. Having 
a name that is tied to your heritage 
says that your heritage matters, and 
that it is something that should be 
worn with pride. A rare name or a 
different spelling of a more common 
name tells a child that they should be 
proud to be unique and creative.
Tailoring our name choices to so-
ciety’s norms sends the message that 
it’s better to go with the ?ow and 
play by the rules, even if the rules are 
wrong. Perhaps it’s idealistic, but I see 
these studies as a challenge, not a ju-
dicial sentence. The biases built into 
judging unusual and even straight-up 
weird names is something that needs 
to be questioned, not given into.

Weird names build cool character, worth risk of stigma
BRANDON SCHMUCK
Last week, the ethics of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Computer Emergency 
Response Team (CERT) were 
challenged 
by The 
Onion Router (Tor) Project’s accusa-
tion that the FBI had paid CERT over 
$1 million to target and identify us-
ers of Tor’s anonymizing service. If 
true, this activity is both an attack on 
user privacy and a blow to the image 
of our university. It calls into ques-
tion the ethics of Internet security 
research being conducted 
at many universities and our own ad-
ministration’s lack of transparency.
Tor, originally created by the U.S. 
Navy, is a network that allows anony-
mous Internet browsing. Since its 
creation, it has become a non-pro?t 
organization in support of Internet 
privacy. While Tor is commonly cited 
in both drug and child pornography 
crime reports, it is also used for many 
legitimate and ethical purposes, such 
as allowing those in oppressive na-
tions to express and educate them-
selves on a free and open Internet.
Internet privacy is a right of the 
people. Because the right has 
been denied by organiza-
tions such as the NSA, 
networks like Tor should 
be protected and fostered by the aca-
demic community. Instead of pro-
tecting Internet privacy, Carnegie 
Mellon has been accused of adding 
“a group of malicious relays” to pick 
out people in the network. Tor works 
by directing user’s encrypted traf?c 
through a series of random nodes 
on the Tor network. Tor believes that 
Carnegie Mellon has discovered and 
abused vulnerabilities in the system, 
allowing it to trace users through 
these nodes.
When breaches in security are dis-
covered by the ethical hacker 
community, they are 
released to the pub-
lic in hopes of 
quickly patching 
them and making services even more 
secure. This is just what Carnegie 
Mellon was planning to do during 
its scheduled talk at Black Hat 2014, 
when it described that it had found a 
breach to “de-anonymize hundreds 
of thousands of Tor clients and thou-
sands of hidden services within a 
couple of months.”
However, when the talk was 
abruptly canceled, its research pur-
pose and ethics became question-
able. Tor’s accusations are further 
strengthened by documents from the 
Silk Road 2.0 trial, which revealed 
that a “university-based research 
institute” had helped to identify sus-
pects. Although both the university 
and the FBI have denied the claims, 
the evidence is slanted against them.
University research is meant to 
bring knowledge to the people 
in an open and ethical way. If 
this accusation is true, Carn-
egie Mellon’s research team 
has gone against all that is 
preached to researchers. Even 
more importantly, this is an 
attack on users’ fundamen-
tal privacy and anonymity 
rights within the Internet. 
Malicious attacks like 
these are not only at-
tacks on the guilty, but 
on everyone in this na-
tion that is connected 
to the Internet. Spying 
on encrypted traf?c is 
equivalent to break-
ing down the doors 
of all Americans in 
hopes of ?nding crim-
inals. Criminals will 
be found, but the big-
gest criminals are the 
ones breaking down the 
doors.

CMU Volleyball takes second in ECAC South tournament
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
Looking ready for champi-
onship season, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s volleyball 
team hosted Marymount Uni-
versity in a battle to move on 
to the Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) South 
Regional Championship semi-
?nals on Wednesday Nov. 11. 
Overpowering an energetic 
attack from Marymount, the 
Tartans landed shots when it 
counted and secured a 3–1 vic-
tory to advance.
The Carnegie women were 
aided by clean play through 
the sets, keeping their shots 
in play and working to return 
some rocketing spikes from 
Marymount. As Marymount 
struggled to keep the ball in 
play under pressure, the Tar-
tans stayed patient and let the 
opponents make the mistakes 
for many key points.
Faced with an aggressive 
attack from Marymount, de-
fensive play by junior libero 
Molly Higgins was a huge part 
of the Tartan success. Calling 
on her team to “Close it down!” 
in the third set, Higgins held 
up for them in the back end, 
adding a one-handed dig for 
the highlight reel.
The team went down early, 
struggling at the start of the 
?rst set before putting things 
together and competing 
through the rest of the game.
The momentum shift came 
early, with the Tartans down 
18–13 in the ?rst set. With the 
team struggling to score points 
on the opposition, ?rst-year 
outside hitter Sydney Bauer 
made her presence known 
with a kill down the middle 
of the defense sparking a run. 
The Tartans responded to her 
efforts and fought to close the 
gap to 22–21. Bauer ?nished 
what she had started, record-
ing back–to–back aces off the 
Marymount defense to give 
the Tartans their ?rst lead of 
the night.
Higgins said of the strug-
gles, “I think what’s hard 
about playing teams that are 
out of your region is you don’t 
really know what to expect”. 
Even facing a team with a style 
different from what they were 
used to, the Tartans eventually 
?gured out the new rhythm 
and got themselves on track.
The ?rst set opened up 
with Marymount out ahead, 
picking up the ?rst point of 
the game and building a lead 
up until the late set rally by 
Bauer got the Tartans back in 
it. Everything didn’t fall into 
place from there, as Carn-
egie Mellon fought through 
a long back and forth for the 
win, dropping match points at 
25–24, 26–25, and 27–26. The 
team ?nally closed out the set 
on defense with a great block 
by Bauer and junior middle 
blocker Jackie Gibbons to get 
the win.
Carnegie Mellon came out 
?ring in the second set, as 
a Bauer kill over the middle 
de?ected out the back end 
to break a 4–4 tie. The team 
pressed, running up their 
lead to 12–4 in what looked 
like a runaway set. However, 
Marymount rallied back as 
the Tartans struggled to score 
again, tying the set at 17. An-
other push got the team back 
out ahead at set point, and 
this time it only took one try to 
capitalize, as ?rst-year outside 
hitter Lauren Mueller blocked 
in a shot for a 25–22 win.
After a very back and forth 
second set, both teams came 
out with more even play in the 
third. With the exception of an 
early hole (9–14) for the Tar-
tans about midway through 
the set, the teams stayed close. 
The gap was short–lived, as ju-
nior setter Emily Newton put 
up the ball on the right side of 
the net for ?rst-year outside 
hitter Sarah Jurgens to smash 
it cross court to back left cor-
ner of the Marymount side.
Both teams stayed even 
late in the set with ties at 17, 
18, and 19 before Marymount 
got out ahead. Down two, 
the Tartans made a ?nal push 
with a Jurgens kill from the 
right off a Newton assist, but it 
wasn’t enough, as the Tartans 
dropped the set for the only 
time of the night, 23–25.
The fourth set went back 
and forth as well, with a seem-
ing momentum shift in Mary-
mount’s favor early, but Carn-
egie Mellon found a lead with 
a block by Mueller and sopho-
more middle blocker Eliza 
Donahue, going up 10–9. An-
other block by the same pair, 
followed by a block by Dona-
hue and Jurgens, got the Tar-
tans going, taking them ahead 
16–11, a lead they would nev-
er relinquish.
As the Tartans looked to 
translate their lead to victory, 
the Marymount side showed 
their desperation, refusing to 
let a Tartan point fall to seal 
the game. On the ?nal point of 
the game, Marymount played 
furiously in an endless point, 
keeping multiple game–end-
ing spikes off the ground. 
Shots by Jurgens and Donahue 
never found home, as Mary-
mount players kept the play 
going for minutes. Finally, the 
Tartans managed the dagger, 
as Bauer took a Newton assist 
and put the ball on the ground 
at the heart of the Marymount 
defense, right in the middle.
Throughout the affair, 
Carnegie Mellon put on a 
show of strength, staying 
positive and very focused in a 
competitive game. Other than 
a few missed shots early in the 
?rst set, the Tartans kept their 
shots on target, making the 
other team miss and playing a 
full competitive effort.
Higgins says the team will 
look to be on their “A–game 
100 percent of the time”, tak-
ing the momentum from this 
game and going for a win in 
the ECAC South Regional 
Championship.
Unfortunately for the Tar-
tans, that never came to frui-
tion. After trading sets with 
Bethany on a way to a 3–2 
victory, the Tartans dropped 
the ?nals 3–1 to Swarthmore, 
bringing a successful season to 
a premature ending.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team took 
to the court for the ?rst time 
this season on Friday night 
to face off against the Wash-
ington and Jefferson Presi-
dents. The Tartans ultimately 
emerged victorious with a 
score of 95–63, due in large 
part to the efforts of D3hoops.
com All-American honoree 
junior Lisa Murphy, who also 
became the tenth Tartan 
to score a thousand career 
points, ending the game with 
a total of 33, the most of four 
Tartans who scored in double 
digits on Friday.
The Tartans established 
dominance quickly, opening 
the game with an impres-
sive 11–0 run during the ?rst 
three and a half minutes. The 
Presidents slightly reduced 
this lead toward the end of 
the ?rst quarter, but the Tar-
tans went into the ?rst break 
with strong scores from both 
Murphy and junior Jackie 
Hudepohl, putting the Tar-
tans up 22–12 heading into 
the second.
Carnegie Mellon again 
opened with multiple unan-
swered scores in the second 
quarter, gaining a 32–12 ad-
vantage as sophomore Zoe 
Zawisa and senior Liza Otto 
made some impressive shots 
against the Washington and 
Jefferson defense.
Otto led scoring in the 
second quarter with seven 
points, and the Tartans went 
into the half comfortably up 
47–26.
The key to the Tartans ?rst 
half success came in their 
rebounding ability, pulling 
down almost twice the boards 
of the Presidents, which tran-
sitioned into the Tartans com-
pleting twice the percentage 
of shots of the Presidents, 
with Washington and Jeffer-
son scoring only on 24.4 per-
cent of their shots, while the 
Tartans scored on 48.6 per-
cent of their attempts.
The third quarter saw 
Carnegie Mellon’s dominance 
continue as they maintained 
the nearly twenty point lead 
that they had established 
earlier in the game. Murphy 
shined here, scoring ten of the 
Tartan’s 18 total points in the 
period, and went into the ?nal 
section of the game just nine 
points shy of her 1000 point 
record.
While the Tartans contin-
ued to shut down the Presi-
dents in the fourth quarter, 
Murphy was focused on her 
goal. She ?nally reached it 
with just under four minutes 
left in play, with a set of back–
to–back layups, the second of 
which gave her 33 points on 
the night and 1001 points to-
tal on her career.
These scores also put the 
Tartans up 84–56, and the 
hope for the Presidents to get 
back into the game seemed to 
be gone.
The Tartans showed no 
mercy, however. They went 
on to score another eleven 
points in the ?nal three min-
utes of the game, notably with 
a beautiful three pointer as 
well as a clean jump shot from 
sophomore Madison Watson. 
These scores were also the 
?rst of her career due to sit-
ting out her freshman season 
because of an injury. The Tar-
tans closed out the game with 
a score line of 95–63.
In total, the Tartans shot 
54.1 percent from the ?oor 
and managed to out rebound 
the Presidents by 18 boards, 
55–38. While Murphy led 
all Tartans scorers with 33 
points, she also pulled down 
11 rebounds, earning her-
self a double–double for the 
26th time in her career. Other 
Tartans joining her in dou-
ble–digit scoring were Otto 
and Hudepohl, each with 14 
points, as well as sophomore 
Anna Novak with 10.
The Tartans women’s bas-
ketball team will take to the 
court again on Friday, Nov. 
20 against Muskingum Uni-
versity at the Allegheny Col-
lege Tip–Off tournament at 4 
p.m. The Tartans will look to 
continue their strong start to 
the season on the shoulders of 
their All–American, and with 
cohesive team play that is sure 
to propel them forward in the 
standings.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Men’s Soccer

CMU Football takes Academic Bowl, share of UAA crown
IAN TANAYA
Asst. Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team played its season ?-
nale against Case Western Re-
serve on Saturday in the 30th 
annual Academic Bowl. With 
a share of the University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) cham-
pionship on the line for both 
teams, the Tartans ended up 
on top 52–42, bringing their 
record to 7–3 overall and end-
ing the season on a six game 
winning streak during which 
they scored over 40 points in 
each game.
Though the weather was 
chilly and windy, the Tartan 
offense ignited quickly as 
sophomore running back Sam 
Benger burst for a 58-yard 
run. Senior quarterback An-
drew Hearon capped off the 
opening drive with an 11-yard 
touchdown pass to sophomore 
wide receiver John Prather 
and put the Tartans up 7–0.
Case Western initially tried 
to counter with a long drive, 
but a holding penalty that 
negated a Case Western ?rst 
down cut their drive short. On 
the Case Western punt, sopho-
more safety Drew Fitzmorris 
fumbled the punt, turning it 
over to Case Western at the 
goal line and leading to a 
touchdown run to tie up the 
game 7–7.
Though the early lead 
was quickly lost, the offense 
worked to reverse the sudden 
shift in momentum. Benger 
led the Tartans offense back 
into Case Western territory, 
but the ?eld goal attempt by 
junior placekicker Gabe Renna 
?ew wide left, turning the ball 
back over to the Spartans. On 
Case Western’s next posses-
sion, the running game gener-
ated plenty of positive yardage 
for the Spartans, but a tipped 
pass led to a fourth down at-
tempt in which the Tartans 
defense covered everyone and 
allowed the offense to take 
over with good ?eld position. 
On a play when Case West-
ern showed a heavy blitz and 
instantly got to Hearon, the 
quarterback still got the ball 
out deep to senior wide receiv-
er Graham Schilling, resulting 
in a touchdown to put the Tar-
tans up 14–7.
On the next drive, a fumble 
by the Spartans negated a play 
that would have gotten them a 
?rst down, forcing Case West-
ern to try a pass that fell in-
complete, returning the ball to 
the Tartan offense. However, 
a Hearon pass ?ew into the 
hands of a Spartan defender 
who quickly dashed into the 
endzone and made the score 
14–14. A few runs by Benger 
and one by Hearon took the 
Tartans close to Spartan terri-
tory as the ?rst quarter came 
to a close.
Opening up the second 
quarter, Hearon threw an-
other interception on third 
down, but a fumble forced by 
senior linebacker Nico Comsa 
and recovered by junior de-
fensive end Brian Khoury 
gave the ball right back to 
Carnegie Mellon. The Tartan 
offense took advantage of its 
second chance, starting off 
with a 25-yard run by Benger. 
Hearon attempted two strikes 
into the endzone, with both 
passes falling incomplete. 
Hearon then scrambled for a 
?rst down, but a holding pen-
alty brought the Tartans back 
to third and long. The penalty 
would not keep the Tartans 
down as Prather managed to 
haul in a long pass to keep the 
drive alive. Three Benger runs 
amounted to two yards, but 
the Tartans attempted a fourth 
down conversion, resulting in 
a touchdown pass to Schilling 
and putting the Tartans up 
21–14.
The next drive for the Spar-
tans started at the three-yard 
line after excellent kickoff 
coverage and an illegal block 
penalty. The pressure lasted 
only one play as a long pass 
got Case Western out of a dan-
gerous situation. However, a 
sack by senior defensive tackle 
Marcus Anthony forced an-
other fumble, recovered by 
sophomore outside lineback-
er Kyle Brittain. The Tartan 
drive started with a fumble 
by Hearon, but Benger kept 
the ball in the hands of the of-
fense. Undaunted by the fum-
ble, Hearon took the next play 
himself, setting up third and 
short. After an overthrown 
ball, the Tartans decided to go 
for it on fourth down. Though 
Hearon managed to scramble 
for a ?rst down, a holding 
penalty negated the positive 
yardage, forcing the Tartans 
to punt.
After placing Case Western 
at the four yard line, the Spar-
tans managed to get off their 
goal after a blown coverage. 
However, the Tartans defense 
was able to stop a Spartan run 
on fourth and short, giving 
the offense another drive with 
very good starting position. 
With another fourth down and 
short for the offense, the Spar-
tan defense thought they had 
stopped Benger at the middle 
of the ?eld, but Hearon fooled 
everyone by taking it himself 
to the outside on a 15-yard 
touchdown run that put the 
Tartans up 28–14.
The Spartans started to 
drive down the ?eld on the 
next series with several long 
completions, getting down to 
the Tartans goal line before the 
Spartan quarterback took it in 
himself and making the score 
28–20 as the Tartans blocked 
the extra point attempt. After 
the kickoff ?ew out of bounds, 
the Tartans came out rushing 
despite having less than two 
minutes remaining in the half. 
Though the Tartans managed 
to get close to another score, 
a personal foul penalty forced 
the Tartans to try a ?eld goal 
that just fell short.
The second half opened 
up with the Spartans driving 
down the ?eld before Comsa 
intercepted a pass that gave 
the Tartans the ball in Spartan 
territory.
A pass interference pen-
alty kept the Tartans’ drive 
alive, and though a personal 
foul penalty put the Tartans 
in a tough spot, Hearon was 
able to make another strike to 
Schilling and put the Tartans 
up 35–20.
The Spartan offense, how-
ever, brought the ball back 
down to Tartans’ territory, 
and a blown coverage gave a 
touchdown to Case Western, 
making the score 35–27 Carn-
egie Mellon.
The Tartans bounced right 
back, driving to the Spartan 
redzone with a balance of 
passes and runs before Schil-
ling recorded his fourth touch-
down of the game and got the 
Tartans up 42–27. A facemask 
penalty on the kickoff gave the 
Spartans great position, and a 
deep pass that got Case West-
ern to the goal line led to a 
short touchdown run, closing 
the gap to 42–34. On the next 
drive, what looked like a sack 
for Case Western turned into 
a long scramble by Hearon. 
After missing a shot to junior 
halfback Zach Cree, a sack 
on Hearon forced the Tartans 
to punt. The Tartans defense, 
however, managed to force a 
three and out on Case West-
ern, and Fitzmorris managed 
to get a good punt return be-
fore a penalty brought it back 
15 yards. Benger recovered 
that yardage on the next play 
to close out the third quarter.
At the start of the fourth 
quarter, a holding penalty was 
rendered irrelevant as Benger 
recovered more than the pen-
alty yardage, continuing to 
run through Case Western’s 
defense. In the last play of the 
drive, Benger fought through 
a number of Spartan defend-
ers before getting into the en-
dzone and putting the Tartans 
up 49–34. The ensuing kickoff 
return got the Spartans close 
to mid?eld to open their next 
drive, but the Tartan defense 
forced another three and out. 
The next drive saw the Tar-
tans begin to run the clock 
down as they fed Benger the 
ball quite a number of times 
before punting the ball away. 
The Spartans began driving 
the ball down?eld toward the 
goal line, and the Spartans 
managed to complete a fourth 
down touchdown pass. Case 
Western made the two point 
conversion, bringing the score 
to 49–42 and putting the pres-
sure back on the Carnegie 
Mellon offense.
The offense, however, 
proved to be more than capa-
ble of handling the pressure.
On the ?rst play of the drive, 
Benger looked like he might 
have been tackled immediate-
ly, but he pushed through and 
earned a ?rst down. After a 
few more runs, Hearon threw 
deep to Schilling and got the 
Tartans down to Case West-
ern’s 30-yard line. Benger’s 
runs continued to keep the 
Tartans offense on the ?eld 
and ate up all of the Spartans’ 
timeouts. Hearon tried to get 
a game-sealing touchdown to 
Schilling, but the incomple-
tion forced the Tartans to try 
for a ?eld goal, which put the 
Tartans up 52–42. The Spar-
tans took advantage of a Tar-
tan pass interference penalty 
on the next drive to get down 
the ?eld, but failed to score on 
fourth and goal, sealing the 
Tartans’ victory.
The win marks the ?rst 
time since 2006 that Carn-
egie Mellon defeated Case 
Western and the ?rst time the 
Tartans beat a top 25 ranked 
football team since the of?cial 
Division III polling began in 
2003. “The win feels amaz-
ing,” Schilling said after the 
game. His career-best 207 re-
ceiving yards and four receiv-
ing touchdowns highlighted 
the offensive effort that has 
earned the Tartans the UAA 
co-championship with Wash-
ington University in St. Louis. 
Though the Tartans started 
the season 1–3, they managed 
to ?nish strong over the past 
six games.
“We all just believed in 
ourselves. We had some tough 
games early on, but we knew 
we had a great team.” In par-
ticular, Schilling considered 
the offensive linemen the criti-
cal component of the offense’s 
superb performances.
With the regular season 
now concluded, the Tartans 
look ahead to postseason op-
portunities like the Eastern 
College Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) 2015 Division III Bowl 
Championships.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team took 
on Cabrini College in the ?rst 
round of the 2015 NCAA Di-
vision III Women’s Soccer 
Championship on Saturday. 
A defensive battle in the ?rst 
half gave way to an onslaught 
of scores in the second as the 
Tartans took the game 5–0, 
advancing the Tartans to the 
next game and tying a school 
record for wins with an over-
all 16–1–1 season record.
The ?rst half of play fea-
tured both teams treading 
cautiously, testing their re-
spective defenses. The Tartan 
offense was the ?rst to strike. 
In the 29th minute, sopho-
more forward Sienna Strit-
ter sent a pass from junior 
defender Samantha Smith 
high from close to mid?eld, 
capitalizing on an uncovered 
goal and putting the Tartans 
up 1–0. The Tartans kept up 
the pressure against Cabrini, 
quickly getting a corner kick 
and some deep throw-ins. The 
?rst half came to a close with-
out much Cabrini pressure on 
the Tartan defense.
In the second half, the Tar-
tans attempted several shots 
to open up and keep Cabrini 
from getting a chance to 
score. The continued pressure 
eventually led to Stritter’s 
second goal of the game and 
?fth goal of the season as she 
drove a ball that bounced off 
of the goalie’s hands into the 
net in the 49th minute. A free 
kick off a foul nearly ended up 
in the net again, but Cabrini 
was able to get the ball out of 
bounds and keep the Tartans 
from doing anything with 
the ensuing corner kick. In 
the 68th minute, senior for-
ward Alli Mcugan’s continued 
pressure on Cabrini’s defense 
resulted in a goal after receiv-
ing a pass from sophomore 
mid?elder Morgan Kontor. 
Sophomore mid?elder Nicole 
Winegardner scored the Tar-
tans’ fourth goal of the night 
off of a pass from junior for-
ward Megan Bartoshuk in the 
80th minute. In the 82nd min-
ute, Winegardner scored once 
more for the Tartans with an 
assist from Bartoshuk, bring-
ing the game to 5–0.
“It was great to get a win 
in front of our fans,” Stritter 
said after the game. The win 
marked the Tartans’ eleventh 
shutout of the season, largely 
driven by the offensive pres-
sure as junior goalkeeper 
Katie Liston only needed to 
make one formal save. Stritter 
acknowledged that the goal 
differential was unexpected 
but was pleased that the of-
fense was able to drive the 
game. “We have such a great 
backline. To put away one 
goal is important. We were on 
a roll today.”
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on SUNY Oneonta. This 
game featured an intensely 
defensive battle with Lis-
ton and both Oneonta goal-
ies saving quite a number of 
shots during regulation. As 
overtime began, a Carnegie 
Mellon foul gave Oneonta a 
chance to win on a free kick, 
but Liston was there to save 
the shot. The Tartans then 
quickly maneuvered the ball 
down the ?eld, and in the 
92nd minute, Stritter ?elded 
a pass from sophomore mid-
?elder Haili Adams, broke 
past the defenders near the 
goalkeeper’s box, took one 
touch around the right side of 
the keeper, and scored for the 
Tartans.
The Tartans will advance 
to sectionals and take on 
Calvin College.

Comedian proposes solutions 
Nathan Fielder demonstrates hysterical ingenuity in McConomy
Comedian Nathan Fielder — marked by an amiable 
awkwardness, prematurely graying hair, and a 
monotone voice — came to McConomy Auditorium 
last Monday to show an unreleased episode of his 
Comedy Central series, Nathan for You.
Fielder, who came to Carnegie Mellon at the 
behest of the Activities Board, came onto the stage 
singing a decidedly tone-deaf version of Lana 
del Rey’s “Born to Die.” Fielder committed to the 
song, continuing his serenade long after it became 
crushingly awkward. Awkwardness, however, is part 
of the comedian’s charm, and he used it effectively 
throughout the night.
Nathan for You, currently in its second season, is 
a show about helping people. Fielder finds small 
businesses that have a problem and offers to solve it 
as creatively as he can. In the episode he screened 
on Monday, for example, he visited a bar in Southern 
California that lost much of its clientele after 
smoking became illegal indoors.
Fielder pored over the law and found a loophole: 
Smoking is allowed indoors if it is an intrinsic part 
of a theatrical performance. After installing a few 
theater seats in the back corner of the bar, Fielder 
premiered Smokers Allowed, a “slice of life” play 
about the patrons of the bar. The episode drew 
laughs from the almost-full auditorium; Fielder 
transformed the bar into an actual play and trained 
actors to replicate that first night of “Smokers 
Allowed.”
Fielder’s comedy comes from a bluntness that 
catches you off guard; he was strikingly candid 
throughout the evening. After he screened the first 
episode, he took questions from the audience. Before 
taking someone’s question, however, he invited the 
student asking it up to the stage, where he got to 
know him or her on a personal level.
Fielder started the conversation with the first 
student by asking him how he decides what to wear, 
and then asking, “Do you work out a lot, or is that 
just fat?” The student responded that it was, in fact, 
just fat, to laughs from the audience. Fielder asked 
the next audience member, a first-year woman, what 
her friends talk about when guys aren’t around. They 
talked, the student answered, “about dicks.” More 
specifically, they talked about “girth.”
After taking questions, Fielder showed one more 
episode of Nathan for You. In this one, Fielder went 
to a hotel to solve a problem endemic to family 
vacations: How can parents still enjoy their vacation 
(by having sex) while sharing a hotel room with their 
small child?
Fielding solved the problem by building a soundproof 
box — painted to look like a rocketship, for 
maximum fun — that a small child could hang out 
in while his parents made love. The episode had me 
laughing until I was gasping when Fielder tested the 
device by putting an eight year old in the box, and 
then testing how soundproof it was by hiring porn 
stars to have an all-out orgy in the room. Luckily, 
the box worked, and the eight-year-old boy heard 
nothing.
Fielder put on a good performance Monday night, 
and watching a couple of episodes of Nathan for 
You was enough to make me want to see more. 
Although Fielder relies on comedic tropes that are 
commonplace in recent-day stand-up — he plays 
almost perfectly into the skinny, awkward, white guy 
trope set by comedians like Daniel Tosh and Demetri 
Martin — he is genuine in a way that few other 
comedians are.

Advice for awkward people
Hey, Josh!
I’ve got some food 
woes to share. All of my 
friends — literally, all of 
them — are vegetarians, 
or vegans, or sanitarians, 
or whatever, and I feel 
a bit persecuted as a 
full-blown carnivore 
whenever we eat 
together. Just yesterday, 
five of my friends and I 
were ordering at a fancy, 
sit-down restaurant 
downtown, and I ordered 
first. I ordered a steak, 
done blue well, which 
is when it’s seared on 
the outside and totally 
red on the inside, and 
it’s literally the most 
delicious thing ever 
on earth. Everyone, 
including the waiter, 
gave me some hardcore 
side-eye, and one of my 
friends fake-vomited 
in her mouth. After 
everyone else had 
ordered all their bean 
curds, and salads, and 
quinoas, they all stared 
at me again. One of my 
friends was like “Did 
you know that red meat 
causes cancer?” and 
another was all “It says 
right here on the menu 
that undercooked meat 
will... blah blah blah.”
It’s not like I think all 
people with dietary 
philosophies/conditions/
preferences are the 
issue, but I’m feeling 
tremendous pressure to 
change my eating habits 
just so that this will stop. 
Help?
Thanks,
Signed,
Carnivore Adoring Barn-
Braised Animals and 
Gratuitous Eating.
Hello CABBAGE,
I think that first and 
foremost, this issue is 
about the company you 
keep. If this is a recurring 
event, you shouldn’t just 
sit there and take it. You 
should tell them plainly that 
you do not appreciate their 
judgement regarding your 
food choices, and that if 
you want their advice, you’ll 
ask. In the same vein, you 
should be careful of judging 
their food, because that’s 
just as rude. While there 
are some great benefits to 
certain alternative diets, it’s 
all about what you want out 
of your eating experience. 
If you are someone who 
really loves meat, and it 
brings you joy, then more 
power to you. If you’re 
someone who treats food 
as fuel, then maybe it’s not 
the best thing to eat all the 
time. Either way, it’s your 
decision to make, and you 
should never feel cowed 
into changing for other 
people. So eat your bloody 
meats with a smile on your 
face, if that’s what you 
want. It’s your money and 
your body, so my advice is 
to just continue doing you.
Cheers,
Joshua Brown.

I didn’t walk into a Bo Burnham show expecting to 
hear everyone in the audience crack their knuckles 
simultaneously. But it happened, and it sounded 
like several thousand cherubs vomited in Carnegie 
Music Hall. “Watch how good the rest of this show 
appears now in relation to that sound,” Bo said.
The rest of the show was in fact much better in 
relation to that hideous sound. Bo has come a long 
way since his era of YouTube videos and Vines, and 
even from his last show titled what. If you aren’t 
familiar with his past work, it often draws from pop 
culture, social issues, and the state of comedy itself. 
He incorporates hip hop and satire into many of his 
pieces as well. His ongoing tour Make Happy delves 
into, for lack of a better term, more mature content 
without compromising unpredictability, raunchiness, 
and silliness. Although to be fair, I might still be the 
only one who finds farting into a microphone silly.
Like his previous shows, this one included 
disembodied voices, strobe lights, and plenty of 
Auto-Tune. There was a bit that portrayed the 
different ways of preparing a peanut butter and jelly 
sandwich depending on the state of intoxication. 
Another bit portrayed a breakup between a long-
term couple, in which Bo repeatedly yelled “Eat a 
dick!” at his now ex-girlfriend until his screams 
became emotional sobs.
The new songs he performed at this show were 
arguably more relevant to current social issues than 
his previous work has been. This included an ironic 
tune detailing the difficulties of being a straight 
white man, and the struggles of finding your true 
soul mate. A note from Bo to straight women, “You 
might think this [perfect] guy only exists in your 
mind. Guess what? You’re right.” And to the straight 
men, “You might think this [perfect] girl only exists 
in your mind. She’s real, but last week she died. If 
you want love, lower your expectations.” He adds 
later, “Deep down you know you don’t deserve 
[love].”
And lowering expectations seems to be a 
recurring theme throughout Bo’s work, with his 
onstage, somehow slightly arrogant persona 
constantly reminding audience members to expect 
disappointment. There are brief moments, however, 
when we as an audience get to see a truer “Bo” on 
stage.
Referring to his own life, Bo questions his own 
decisions and whether they’ve made him happy — 
hence the tour name, Make Happy. Toward the end 
of his show, with all the lights in the auditorium on 
so that Bo could see each member in the audience, 
he knelt down and ranted. Part of his spiel included 
telling the audience, “We [performers] say follow 
your dreams. Don’t. If this is your dream, just 
race for failure. Or, reevaluate because this is not 
a meritocracy. I’ve had a privileged life, and I’ve 
been lucky, and I’m unhappy.” Despite the gravity 
of the topic, Bo still managed to keep the audience 
laughing and received a well-deserved standing 
ovation.
Anyone who knows me knows that I’m a sucker for 
the type of self-deprecating, critical humor — with 
bits of existential crises scattered throughout — 
that Bo performs. I also appreciated the honesty 
incorporated in his work, most notably with one 
of his opening statements: “Andrew Carnegie, the 
Donald Trump of the 1890s.”
Make Happy is a more refined, more mature 
Burnham that’s simultaneously hilarious and 
severely depressing. He performed a few old songs 
that, while they are fan favorites, I found cringe-
worthy compared to his newer material. I still 
laughed throughout the entire show but by the 
time I got home I felt like a train had run over all 
my hopes and dreams. I’m kidding, kind of. I’m not 
going to say it’ll make you happy, but it’ll make 
you feel something in this soul-sucking demon of a 
school. We may not all be performers, but many of 
us have faced the difficulty in pursuing what truly

After seeing the progression in Bo’s work, I’m 
curious as to what direction his comedy will take 
in the future. If you can, definitely catch one of his 
Make Happy shows while he’s still on tour, or just 
watch it when it (probably) airs on Netflix in the 
next year or two.

Tisbert delivers Ted Talks parody TisTalks 
Scotch’n’Soda’s comedy group performs student-written, fairly funny sketch comedy show
Last Friday and Saturday, Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s sketch 
comedy group Tisbert premiered their Fall show — 
“TisTalks.” The hour-long show was entirely student-
written, produced, directed, and of course performed. 
I was impressed by the list of ten-plus student 
writers in particular, which left me wondering who 
wrote what and how the collaboration process 
worked. As you might guess from the title, the 
gimmick of TisTalks was Ted Talks, the nonprofit 
and global phenomenon devoted to “ideas worth 
spreading.” When the lights went down in Porter Hall 
100, the half-full audience broke into cheers, excited 
for what was to come.
The show began with a slideshow — a masterpiece 
of Windows Movie Maker, no doubt — featuring 
stock photos of flowers and promising inspiring talks 
on “your ex,” “why are the bees disappearing?” and 
“things.” Apart from the projector, which would make 
several memorable appearances, the other Ted Talk 
staple was a series of lecture-style monologues every 
few sketches, one for each of the five performers. 
These were generally a refreshing way to break up 
the sketches and prepare the audience for more.
The show’s use of props (especially the projector) 
could only be called minimalist, which worked 
surprisingly well. The best jokes were able to shine 
through without fluffy distractions, and the few props 
that were used formed the centerpiece of their own 
sketches. Incidentally, my favorite monologue — and 
undeclared first-year in the College of Engineering 
Grant Seastream’s best performance of the night — 
was a TisTalk from the founder of a German design 
company that constructs everything out of cardboard 
boxes. The secret of their building material is so well 
kept that you’ve never heard of the company, and 
that’s the way they like it. Seastream demonstrated 
some of the company’s designs with his own 
cardboard box, which became a glove when he stuck 
his hands in it, a hat when he put it on his head and, 
when he stepped into it, a “small boat.” He displayed 
more complicated designs on the projector, including 
an image of a struggling neighborhood his company 
had totally rebuilt — again, with cardboard boxes.
I’ll admit that the first monologue — a female Fortune 
500 CEO telling the long-winded, nonsensical tale of 
how she got there — was fairly underwhelming. The 
“parents meet the girlfriend” sketch that followed 
it was downright cringe-worthy. I’m sure plenty of 
rednecks would’ve taken offense at electrical and 
computer engineering masters student Darrin Willis’s 
over-the-top “Prospector Betty,” who walked like she 
had a horse between her legs and proudly asserted 
to her boyfriend’s posh parents that she was a gold-
digger, just not in the way they feared. This sketch 
was too dependent on played-out “hick” stereotypes 
and, in the end, not all that funny.
After a fairly disappointing start, the quality of the 
sketches improved and hovered at a consistently 
entertaining level through the rest of the show. A 
sketch lives and dies on its seed premise, so it makes 
sense that the show was often hit or miss. Sketch 
comedy often is. The weakest were those that relied 
too heavily on crass, obvious humor, such as a sketch 
where the whole joke was a professor with a lisp 
and another where a family game of charades was 
ruined by the older brother’s sexual interpretations of 
supposedly “innocent” clues (“That’s f***ing! That’s 
obviously f***ing! I’m done!”; “That’s inappropriate, 
Timmy! Your sister is obviously acting out The Lion 
King!”).
Meanwhile, the best sketches of the night were 
clever, simple ideas colored in with details and 
dragged out to their highest potential for absurdity. 
Both of my favorites featured senior business 
major Mya Snyder, the only woman in the cast, 
who consistently developed unique, convincing 
characters. The first was the “Never Have I Ever” 
championship between the most inexperienced 
shut-ins of the world: Snyder’s wiggly-fingered, 
crazy-eyed incumbent; undeclared Dietrich first 
year Philip DeCicco’s love, peace, and flowers cult 
member; and Wilson, a stone-faced sociopath who 
“literally lives under a rock.” The “why hasn’t anyone 
thought of this” premise and strong characters 
(DeCicco and Wilson’s strongest) made this sketch, 
which — predictably — ended with Wilson’s 
character viciously taking Snyder down (“Never have 
I ever won the ‘never have I ever’ championship”). 
Another memorable sketch featured the mugging 
of that eerily familiar pretentious hipster whom 
you’d be kind of happy to see mugged, again played 
by Snyder. David Frank’s best moment arrived 
in the “Feelin’ the Burn with Bernie” sketch. I’d 
never before known how much I wanted to see 
our presidential candidates go head to head via 
‘80s-style workout videos.
Despite a few misses, TisTalks was an entertaining 
hour of student-run and written sketch comedy. The 
cast members fully dedicated themselves to even the 
weaker spots of writing, and I was reminded how 
funny collaboration and a lot of enthusiasm can be.

In the spirit of absolute absurdity and giving it your 
all, TisTalks ended with performers covering each 
other’s faces in copious amounts of chili.

I have a golden rule when it comes to TV shows: 
I can only make judgments on whether or not the 
show is going to be worthwhile after watching three 
episodes. After this week’s episode, I am finally 
able to formulate my opinion on the new CBS show 
Supergirl. After the trailer caused some uproar in 
the comic fan community, because it was selling the 
TV show like the Saturday Night Live’s (SNL) Black 
Widow movie parody, the show’s pilot was “leaked” 
online, and it was much better than what the trailer 
made it out to be. The show has a lot of potential, 
and it’s ultimately up to CBS whether the show will 
succeed or not.
The first episode contains a lot of background, and a 
lot of foray into who the characters are and why they 
are there. Kara Zor-El (a.k.a. Kara Danvers, a.k.a. 
Supergirl) is portrayed by Glee alum Melissa Benoist, 
who has an amazing voice, an amazing face, and is 
overall a badass. she can do everything her cousin 
(Kal-El, a.k.a. Superman, a.k.a. Clark Kent) can while 
running around in heels and a skirt, something that 
Superman can’t do. But actually, superheroines have 
always been looked at with some serious skepticism 
based on what they wear since they normally put 
them in revealing outfits that offer no practical use. 
For similar outfit situations, see: Wonder Woman 
’75, any depiction of Black Cat, or a bunch of other 
comic renditions of women. However, DC has been 
putting some practicality in their female characters’ 
wardrobe choices, for example, both iterations of 
the Black Canary, and Speedy in the CW’s Arrow. 
The first episode does a good job of setting exactly 
why Kara thinks the way she does and explains the 
symbolism behind the “S” and why it’s important for 
that to be the main aspect of her costume.
Supergirl does a good job of balancing Kara’s 
personal and “professional” lifestyles: her personal 
being her job and her life outside of being Supergirl, 
and her professional life being Supergirl. It also does 
a good job of providing a background and a sense 
of fulfillment to her personal life: in essence giving 
some information about her relationship with her 
sister and the possibilities of complicating her life 
with two different men. One of them, her best friend 
in the company (portrayed by fantastic singer Jeremy 
Jordan) and a new romantic interest in Jimmy Olsen, 
portrayed by Mehcad Brooks from True Blood. The 
show, however, doesn’t rely on this as the main plot 
point. It’s all about Kara’s self-discovery and her 
journey in understanding and controlling her powers. 
It’s also more about her and her adoptive sister, 
portrayed by Chyler Leigh, Dr. Lexie Grey in Grey’s 
Anatomy, who has known of Kara’s powers since 
they were children and who only recently revealed 
that she was working for the Department of Extra-
Normal Operations, which is this universe’s version 
of Marvel’s SHIELD.
The show’s only failing is in the special effects. The 
fighting while flying could use some work, but overall 
it’s decent. I’d much prefer for the studios to spend 
their money on making a high quality show than for 
them to only focus on the special effects and end 
up ruining the show. However, if you’re hoping for 
movie-quality special effects, you’ll be disappointed. 
Hopefully, as the season goes on, the quality of 
special effects, action sequences, and fight scenes 
will improve.
After three episodes, I have to say I’m going to keep 
watching the show. It’s entertaining, high energy, 
high action, and full of interesting characters that 
have room to grow and develop throughout the 
series. I’m hoping that National City, Central City, 
Star City, Gotham, and Metropolis are closer than 
they seem, so we can see more interaction between 
the heroes of the DC TV universe — although I’m 
not hopeful, since this show is being run by CBS 
and seems more connected to the movie universe 
rather than that of its television counterpart. Maybe 
we’ll see a Glee reunion (the Flash’s Grant Gustin 
was also in Glee with Melissa Benoist). All in all, 
I’d keep an eye on this fledgling show, as it still 
has the ability to surprise and excite people, while 
introducing them to a slew of dynamic characters in 
a relatively unexplored superhero universe.
Supergirl airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on CBS.

posters
pillbox 11.16.157
Carnegie Mellon, in addition to being a world leading 
institute of higher education, also happens to be 
home to one the greatest poster collections in the 
world. Located on the top floor of Hunt Library, the 
Carnegie Mellon Swiss Poster Collection includes 
originals of some of the most iconic and innovative 
graphic design work from the past 50 odd years. In 
total, the collection includes over 300 works with 
varied themes and styles, together sharing the 
pinnacle of good graphic design for the modern 
era. Recently, I had the privilege of being shown 
around the entire collection. The way that ideas were 
expressed through striking yet simple visual imagery 
and type blew my mind.
The collection was established by Swiss graphic 
designer Ruedi Ruegg and Professor Daniel Boyarski 
in 1985 as a teaching collection. The story goes that 
every year, Ruegg would find the most intriguing 
graphic design work done that year, and have it 
shipped across the Atlantic to Professor Boyarski. 
Over the course of time, this resulted in the 
creation of a veritable collection featuring legendary 
designers such as Ruegg herself, Bill, Bruhwiler, 
Kulling, Leupin, Muller-Brockmann, Pfund, Troxler, 
and Weingart.
The posters were created for a variety of purposes: 
one was a hard hat warning for construction workers, 
another a flyer for a Blues concert. Many of them 
were embodiments of simple little things in Swiss 
culture. Using form, color, image and typography, 
the posters successfully convey ideas — some 
complex and some elementary — with remarkable 
clarity that would in many cases require paragraphs 
of text to achieve. They are immediate in impact, 
spontaneous, and often playful or humorous. Even 
more interesting, there is something decidedly Swiss 
about all of them; perhaps it is the remarkable clarity 
of thought, or the sense that every shade, every serif, 
really everything has been carefully considered by 
the designer.
There is an unmistakable chronological continuity 
to the collection. Posters from the 1950s and ‘60s are 
from the traditional “Swiss School” of Design, and 
rely heavily on composition, typography, and clear 
communication. This style garnered international 
acclaim and made the Swiss Poster a model in 
graphic design. Work from the ‘70s onwards is more 
experimental, closer to “Street Art.” The designs tend 
to be flamboyant and striking, and the focus tends 
to shift just a little from the typography and to the 
imagery. Another theme that struck me is the level 
of visual and cultural sophistication that a viewer 
is encouraged to bring to the posters. I remember 
some of the designs taking on a far more substantial 
meaning on a second or third viewing, or when given 
some historical context. A viewer’s intelligence is not 
only respected, but expected.
One of the designs that really stood out was “Milch,” 
an unbelievably simple design — a serene blue 
background with the word “Milch” crayoned in 
black, with the “ch” of Milch enclosed in a messy 
white oval. I found out much later that Milch is 
the German word for Milk; even so, one look at the 
poster and I knew what it was about. Another was 
an advert, ironically enough, for a Swiss Poster 
design competition. A three-fourths plus sign, very 
reminiscent of the Swiss flag, in unusual colors — 
shades of blue, yellow and red — and organized, 
clear typography went a long way in building the 
theme that the event is clearly very Swiss, with 
shades of edgy relevance.
Till recently, I had no idea that this collection existed 
at Carnegie Mellon, and I’m very glad to have found 
it. It really is an undiscovered gem for anyone 
even remotely interested in graphic design. Full of 
innovative work from the legends of the field, the 
collection is a great place to look for inspiration for 
any graphic-related work.

Straight Outta Compton 
Friday, Nov. 20, 10 p.m.
Sunday Nov. 22, 8 p.m.
N.W.A. was America’s most dangerous rap group. With lyrics about the world around them in Compton, they exposed America to a “gangsta rap”, a genre that chronicled 
real life experiences. Straight Outta Compton follows the journey of Eazy-E, Dr. Dre, Ice Cube, MC Ren, and DJ Yella (Jason Mitchell, Corey Hawkins, O’Shea Jackson Jr., 
Aldis Hodge, and Marlon Yates Jr. respectively) from the streets of Compton to the pressures of fame. When Jerry Heller (Paul Giammati) first meets Eazy-E, he immedi-
ately sees talent and helps promote N.W.A.’s first single “Boyz-N-The Hood,” featuring lyrics by Ice Cube, music by Dr. Dre, and vocals by the first-time rapper Eazy-E. As 
the group members gain popularity, they continuously run into trouble with the law because of their lyrics opposing law enforcement. Following the release of their game-
changing album Straight Outta Compton, N.W.A. begins to fall apart due to business relations between Eazy-E and Heller. Things quickly become hostile after Ice Cube 
departs from the group and several diss tracks are exchanged. Dr. Dre departs soon after and goes on to create Death Row records, the label that brought Snoop Dogg 
and Tupac fame. The members of N.W.A. are brought to life on screen by the actors, including O’Shea Jackson Jr. who has the honor of playing his father, Ice Cube. Follow 
N.W.A.’s journey from breakups, to makeups, to arrests as its members tell the story of American street violence and institutional racism.

Phipps Conservatory is well known for its elaborate 
botanical gardens, plant collections, and seasonal 
exhibits. Some crowd favorites at the conservatory 
include the Japanese Bonsai displays, the Butterfly 
Garden, and the Orchid Garden. Along with the 
permanent exhibits and gardens, Phipps hosts a variety 
of artists, exhibits, and displays that interchange 
throughout the seasons.
I had the pleasure of visiting one of Phipps’s newest 
garden exhibits: Garden Railroad, which is located in 
the south conservatory. This exhibit has previously been 
a crowd-pleaser, but has been newly re-imagined into 
a wonderfully detailed world of toy railroads and ornate 
miniature towns that tell the tales of classic childhood 
fables and fairytales. Jordyn Melino designed Garden 
Railroad in collaboration with horticulturist Aaron 
D’Addio and animatronics technician Paul Widek.
Being both a fan of childhood classics and a Phipps 
Conservatory enthusiast, I was excited to visit the 
Garden Railroad exhibit. In true Phipps’ fashion, the 
room was filled with the fresh, relaxing aroma of plants 
and flowers, perfectly intertwined with the miniature 
landscapes that filled the center-most portion of the 
room. Upon walking into the room, you are immersed in 
a variety of fairy tales, ranging from There Was an Old 
Woman Who Lived in a Shoe to The Little Engine That 
Could.
As I walked around the garden, one of the first tales that 
was on display was Peter Pan. I was pleased to discover 
that the exhibit featured interactive elements. When 
I pressed the buttons in front of the various fairy tales 
and fables, I saw the exhibit truly come to life. I pressed 
the button in front of the Peter Pan display and watched 
with satisfaction as Captain Hook’s pirate ship was 
chased around a small pond by the menacing Tick-Tock 
the Crocodile. As the ship sails around, a whimsical 
voice is heard in the background, “Second star to the 
right and straight on till morning.”
Up next was The Little Engine That Could. I was 
pleased to find out the interactive buttons accompanied 
not only the Peter Pan display, but the majority of the 
displays within Garden Railroad. Upon pressing the 
button, The Little Engine That Could chugs up a steep 
hill, chanting “I think I can, I think I can,” all the way 
up. The display has the viewer practically chanting 
along with The Little Engine as he finally makes it 
over the top of the hill and rides down the other end in 
victory.
Moving on in the exhibit, the stories of Rapunzel, Little 
Red Riding Hood, Goldilocks and the Three Bears, 
Jack and the Beanstalk, and Paul Bunyan are told all 
throughout the gardens. Although each of the displays 
tells its own story, Garden Railroad has a wonderful 
sense of cohesion and coherence. The landscape is 
interlocked and the towns of each fairy tale spill over 
into the next. Several interlacing railroad tracks traverse 
the miniature towns as trains zig and zag all over the 
room, shining light onto the plants and flowers that 
outline the displays.
Lastly, I came to The Three Little Pigs display. The 
detailing of the pigs three houses was quite impressive, 
and the overall scene was well complemented alongside 
the forest-like display of the plants. I looked around in 
excitement as I searched for this display’s interactive 
button. I pressed the button in anticipation, and I was 
not let down. Out from behind the trees came the big 
bad wolf on his search for the three little pigs, hitching 
a ride on the back of the train. At this point, all hope of 
remaining maturity went out the window. The exhibits 
brought out fond memories of childhood, and it was 
difficult not to act like a giddy little kid. I looked around 
to see if I was alone in my feelings of childlike wonder, 
and as expected, was not. The exhibit put a smile on 
the faces of child and adult onlookers alike.
Whether you’re in the mood to spend an evening 
immersed in your favorite childhood fairy tales, or you 
just need a reason to spend a peaceful evening away 
from the stressful life of a Carnegie Mellon student, I 
suggest visiting Garden Railroad. The garden exhibit 
will be featured during the entire month of November.

Ingrid Schaffner is an art critic set to curate the 57th 
Carnegie International. The Carnegie International is 
one of the world’s leading surveys in contemporary art. 
If you’re anything like me, just the words “contemporary 
art” make you fall asleep. It triggers thoughts such as 
“I could’ve done this” or “how is this any better than 
something a kindergartener draws?” This happens 
because I just don’t understand contemporary art. So 
in my attempt to be less closed-minded on the subject, 
I attended a talk hosted by Schaffner at the Carnegie 
Museum of Art entitled “What is Contemporary Art?”
Shaffner began by presenting a list that divided 
contemporary art into the following categories: terrain, 
systems, reference, history, business, identity, form, 
ornament, alchemy, evocation, storage, resistance, 
and technology. Many of these categories are self-
explanatory, however some required a deeper analysis. 
One of the first categories she discussed was systems. 
This was the idea of laying out a path for the viewer 
to follow. Schaffner discussed several artistic exhibits 
that only showcased dates or locations and how these 
exist to highlight travels and the passage of time. While 
many of the exhibits of which she spoke were very 
simplistic, Schaffner explained how they told the story 
of time passage through their dates. This made me 
understand a little bit more about the intentions behind 
contemporary art, and I pressed on to find out why I still 
felt like it was so simple to execute.
Another important category discussed was reference. 
This explores the idea that everything that could 
ever be created was already done by modern artists, 
so post-modern artists are forced to simply copy and 
repeat what has already been done. The focus of this 
was works of art that recycled or sampled previously 
used ideas. Schaffner’s main example for this was Andy 
Warhol’s pop art work, which resampled pictures of 
iconic figures in various colors. It was at this moment 
I realized that contemporary artists don’t have it that 
easy. No one will ever paint another Mona Lisa, so are 
all contemporary artists left to just scavenge through 
bits of recycled art? Is that why no one even bothers to 
make art that resembles Renaissance level work?
One of the most peculiar categories that Schaffner 
discussed was ornament. This was literally just art used 
as decoration. She showed a sculpture of a completely 
hard couch to show that the difference between 
furniture and ornament is the functionality of the piece. 
Schaffner rationalized that the purpose of this art was 
not only in the decoration, but also in the placement 
of it. On the other hand, the concept of evocation was 
about much more than just decoration. This aimed to 
evoke an initial emotion out of the viewer before they 
are allowed to focus on what is actually happening. 
These are the very emotional pieces that feature 
artifacts and remnants from the artist’s past. Whether 
it’s happiness, sadness, frustration, or elation, the aim is 
to make the viewer feel something. This is the art that 
I find to be much more relatable, just because the artist 
puts more of her personal experiences into it. This is the 
contemporary art that makes sense to me because even 
if it is not a beautiful painting, it is still an expression of 
self. 
Another concentration of contemporary art that Shaffner 
discussed was technology. This focused on art that 
not only was about the rise of technology, but art that 
utilized various forms of digital media to convey a 
message. This is the aspect of contemporary art that I 
have often found the most confusing because it seems 
so abstract sometimes. Schaffner explained however 
that much of the art in this category is in the creation of 
the piece as opposed to the actual work itself.
Schaffner attempted to give me the tools to be able to 
dip my toes into the contemporary art world. I really 
enjoyed the way she broke up the different elements 
into categories and explained the art through the lens 
of each category to help it make a little more sense. I 
wouldn’t say I’m an expert by any means, but I do think 
that I am more aware of the thought that goes into 
creating the art despite how simple it is. I  went to this 
talk with one goal in mind: to finally understand what 
the hell is happening in contemporary art and to not 
think so negatively of it. Do I know what’s happening in 
most of it? Not really, but I will be making an attempt to 
be a little more considerate of the feelings and purposes 
behind the blank canvases with a single-square painted 
on them.

If you haven’t studied abroad, you probably know 
someone who has. You run into her on campus, ask her 
about her time away, and she says the typical things. 
From “It was amazing!” to “You would have loved it!” 
to “I wish I was still there,” the hype around study 
abroad never changes. But why? How can countless 
young adults go to various countries year after year and 
return with the same enthusiastic message? Is study 
abroad really that great, or is everyone committed to 
maintaining its mystique, like the Illuminati? Is study 
abroad the new Illuminati?
Four years ago, I was a skeptical high school student 
with questions like these, and for a while I let my doubts 
get the best of me. I was worried about missing my 
friends, leaving the senior I liked, getting my license 
late, and what my parents would say. These seemed 
like valid reasons, until my friend Meyer returned senior 
year from spending a year in Spain. Not only did she 
acquire awesome stories and Spanish ?uency, but she 
also didn’t miss a beat, winning senior class president 
while out of the country. Meanwhile, everything she left 
was practically the same, including me with no driver’s 
license.
Her success taught me that I played it safe when I 
shouldn’t have. I felt like Eminem was disappointed in 
me for missing my one shot and letting everything slip. 
So, I made it my mission to redeem myself in college 
and do study abroad. Since I now have a few weeks left 
in Italy, this list will probably change, but here are ten 
moments that put my redemption off to a great start.
Exploring Italy
Rather than going to all the major European cities, I’ve 
focused most of my efforts on Italy. I visited Rome, Pisa, 
Venice, and Cinque Terre and hope to make it to Milan, 
Naples, and Pompeii before time is up. My logic is that 
this period of time is the only time I’ll live in Italy so I 
might as well see as much of the country as I can.
Exploring Europe
Traveling really is a means to an end. Even if I hadn’t 
chosen Europe, all the other continents are so vast that 
traveling would have been easy and affordable.
My roommates
I actually didn’t think I’d be close to other exchange 
students, but my roommates are truly my people. From 
loving TV to having the same sense of humor, I’ve made 
lifelong friends that I can’t imagine not knowing.
Receiving Jif Peanut Butter in the mail
If you love Nutella, congratulations! You’ll love Italy. If 
you love peanut butter like me, you’ll constantly think, 
“I’ve made a huge mistake.” Italy only carries Skippy, 
so I either have to sell out and eat Skippy or hold out. 
I found My American Market, a French website that 
sells American groceries. Getting Jif felt like Christmas, 
but other great moments came out of it too. Pop Tarts 
mesmerize the Italians while all the Americans want to 
know how I pulled it off.
Food
All the food is incredible and I have yet to have a bad 
meal. The bad pizza tastes like Digiorno’s or Pizza Hut 
and the great pizza tastes like heaven and I start crying 
because I don’t feel worthy. The pastries, though, are 
essential and gelato once a day keeps the doctor away.
Weather
Florence feels like Pittsburgh in September, except it 
stays that way for the entire season and will never drop 
below freezing. I joke with my roommate, who’s from 
Michigan, that winter is coming, asking her if we’re 
ready. Meanwhile, everyone around us, including my 
suitemate from Miami, is investing in coats because the 
high is 60°F.
Drinking legally
I can’t speak much about Florence’s nightlife, but as 
someone under the age of 21, casually ordering any drink 
off a menu feels incredible.
Beautiful people
You saw this coming, but it’s true. Everyone is gorgeous 
and I try not to think about it. Instead, I may or may not 
go to this pizza place once a week and ?irt with the all 
male staff when I order. Naturally, the restaurant is called 
Gusta Pizza.
Walking everywhere
I have always hated exercising, but some wise, sadistic 
Italian put me in one of the farthest apartments from 
campus. Since I avoid the metric system, I’m not really 
sure how much I’m walking but once you factor in the 
daily battle with tourists, tour groups, pigeons, bikers, 
taxis, and the occasional carriage ride, it feels much 
farther than Fairfax ever did. Plus, the campus elevator 
never works so those 9 ?ights of stairs serve as my daily 
cardio.
The Euro
You get a lot of bang for your buck in Europe, or you will 
once you stop calculating how many US dollars you’re 
spending. For example, spending 20€ or less in Conad, 
the Italian grocery store, always gets me a week’s worth 
of groceries. If every Carnegie Mellon student went into 
Giant Eagle with $20, how many of us would be done?
Honorable mention: getting stranded at IKEA
Everyone knows that moving doesn’t feel real until 
you ?nd yourself in IKEA. Two of my suitemates had 
never been to an IKEA in the U.S.  so my roommate 
and I decided to end this tragedy. The Florence IKEA is 
so great that Europeans trust each other to bring pets 
inside and not destroy the place. It sounds absurd, but 
that IKEA was the cleanest one I’d ever been to. It might 
have been the best IKEA ever if it weren’t for their café. 
It was a great Saturday until the shuttle bus didn’t show 
up. Spirits were high, though, and the IKEA virgins lived 
to tell the tale.
It’s hard to explain, but to me, study abroad feels like 
creating an alternate reality for your life. For a few 
months, you acclimate to a different country, culture, and 
sometimes language. It’s a very daunting, yet rewarding 
process, especially for the restless and the curious. You 
could be right and have a list of reasons for why you 
can’t, such as your major, your parents, your signi?cant 
other, Greek life, etc. However, I’d tell you and my high 
school self what Tina Fey learned from Amy Poehler on 
Saturday Night Live — “Do your thing and don’t care if 
they like it.”

This Saturday, Contemporary Christian Rocker Chris Tomlin played 
at the CONSOL Energy Center in downtown Pittsburgh. Attendees 
braved rush hour on a cold evening to be treated to an enthusiastic, 
dynamic, and earnest take on Christian Rock from a mainstay of the 
genre. The audience sang with him and he’d often stop, listen to the 
crowd and answer questions. Above: Tomlin performs for a packed 
CONSOL Energy Center.
