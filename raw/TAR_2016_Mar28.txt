Judge Ginsburg defends originalist interpretations of the law
DANA KIM
Staffwriter
On Wednesday, March 23, an 
impressive number of people assem-
bled in the Giant Eagle auditorium 
in Baker Hall for Judge Douglas H. 
Ginsburg’s lecture titled “A Matter of 
Interpretation.” Among the audience 
were not only Carnegie Mellon 
students and faculty members, but 
also graduate students and law stu-
dents from neighboring universities 
and members of the broader Pitts-
burgh community.
The event was organized by 
Kiron Skinner, the director of Carn-
egie Mellon’s Institute of Politics 
and Strategy and the Center for 
International Relations and Politics. 
Joseph Devine, assistant dean of Di-
etrich College, gave the opening re-
marks, and William Carter Jr., dean 
of the University of Pittsburgh School 
of Law, moderated the Q&A session 
following the lecture.
Judge Ginsburg is a federal judge 
on the United States Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia Circuit, 
which some may argue is the second 
most in?uential court in our nation 
after the Supreme Court. The popu-
larity of the event was unsurpris-
ing, as Judge Ginsburg is consid-
ered to be — according to Devine’s 
introduction — “one of the nation’s 
most distinguished jurists.” Judge 
Ginsburg was even nominated for a 
seat on the Supreme Court by Presi-
dent Ronald Reagan in 1987, though 
he withdrew his nomination shortly 
thereafter. His lecture, named after 
the late Justice Antonin Scalia’s book 
A Matter of Interpretation, revolved 
around two major themes: the pur-
pose of having a written constitution 
and the federal courts’ roles in inter-
preting legislative statutes.
Judge Ginsburg set the stage for 
his discussion on the philosophy of 
Justice Scalia with an in-depth ex-
planation of common law, to which 
he would constantly refer back 
throughout the rest of his lecture. 
He described common law as a type 
of “judge-made law” in which judges 
decide the customs. He states that 
it is a process in which, “judges are 
hearing a dispute, resolving them in 
a way they think is just or appropriate 
or perhaps more ef?cient … by [us-
ing] some criteria that resolves that 
dispute, which puts the judge in the 
position of lawmaker.” This question 
of whether judges assume the role 
of discovering or creating the law 
steered the conversation into a more 
extensive exploration of Justice Sca-
lia’s legal philosophy.
It is without a doubt that Justice 
Scalia’s intellectual in?uence had a 
great impact on American law and 
conservative politics, though he was 
notoriously pugnacious and was crit-
icized by many for being callous at 
times. The late justice was best known 
for adopting a rigidly originalist ap-
proach towards his interpretation of 
JSA celebrates Japanese culture at 2016 Matsuri Festival 
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
This Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Japanese Student 
Association (JSA) hosted its 
annual, non-pro?t, Matsuri 
Spring Festival in Rangos 
Ballroom. Matsuri is tradi-
tionally a festival celebrated 
at Shinto Shrines in Japan, 
but is now seen as a way for 
the Japanese population to 
enjoy street food, games, and 
performances. For the JSA it 
was a celebration of Japanese 
culture and heritage recreat-
ed for members of the Carn-
egie Mellon community to 
experience.
From 3 p.m. to 8 p.m., 
students from diverse 
backgrounds ?ocked to Ran-
gos Ballroom to support this 
event. Small colorful booths, 
decorated with beautifully 
crafted paper lanterns, were 
set up along the sides of Ran-
gos. Each booth displayed 
hand made signs adorned 
with Japanese characters that 
promoted their respective ac-
tivities. Volunteers for the 
event invited guests to taste a 
variety of Japanese food such 
as takoyaki, yakisoba, oko-
nomiyaki, doroyaki, and dan-
go. Also available to guests 
were fun games such as sen-
bon-tsuri and wanage. Mem-
bers of J@CMU were present 
to teach origami lessons and 
cooking lessons for those 
interested.
While the above listed 
events came with a small 
fee, performances by various 
Pittsburgh Japanese music 
groups were free to all. In at-
tendance were Pitt FRESA, 
Rikhide, Zixuan’s Legs, 5 Mu-
sicians & Koso, SupaNEETS, 
and Pittsburgh Taiko. Guests 
at this event were seen walk-
ing around with food and 
drinks, rocking out to the mu-
sic and having a good time.
Sophmore JSA Board 
Member and business major 
Emily Hirao stated “Matsuri 
was created in order to show 
the community of Carnegie 
Mellon University a taste of 
what festivals in Japan are 
like. Matsuri is literally trans-
lated as “festival” in Japa-
nese, and is a fond memory 
that every person in Japan 
holds dear to their hearts as it 
reminds them of the delicious 
aromas coming from the vari-
ous food booths, prizes that 
are won from games while be-
ing cheered on by family and 
friends, and the excitement of 
watching performances from 
the local community.”
Although one of Satur-
day’s Matsuri Festival’s mis-
sions was to present a small 
snippet of Japanese culture 
to the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity, just as important 
was its mission to help those 
in need in Japan. All of the 
festival’s pro?ts will be sent 
to the Minato Middle School 
in Ishinomaki, Japan, whose 
campus was destroyed in the 
East Japan Earthquake on 
March 11, 2011. 
Freshman JSA Board 
Member Chie Wach stated, 
“Matsuri is not only Carn-
egie Mellon’s most celebrated 
event of Japanese culture, but 
also an opportunity for JSA 
and the entire student body 
to help the students of Mi-
nato Middle School recover 
from the devastating effects 
of the March 11 earthquake 
in Japan.” 
Minato Middle School is 
currently getting by with the 
utilization of “make-shift 
shelters on the playground of 
a nearby elementary school,” 
as stated on the festival’s web-
site. The pro?ts made from 
last year’s Masturi Festival 
were able to help students get 
sports equipment and sup-
ported their music classes. 
The JSA is hoping to build 
off the momentum that was 
created last year and help Mi-
nato Middle School get closer 
to the state they were in be-
fore the disastrous effects of 
the earthquake.

suri festival can be found

This week, Ian Asenjo, 
a sophomore global stud-
ies major with an additional 
major in ethics, history, and 
public policy, was awarded 
the Critical Language Schol-
arship from the U.S. State 
Department, which will give 
him the opportunity to spend 
his summer in Chandigarh, 
India studying Punjabi.
This cultural and linguis-
tic immersion program is 
intended to encourage stu-
dents to study languages 
that are drastically different 
from English. Many Ameri-
can language learners do 
not choose to master these 
languages due to the drastic 
differences, and we do not 
have enough native speak-
ers. With supply low, demand 
is high for speakers of these 
critical languages, such as 
Arabic, Swahili, Urdu, Turk-
ish, and Punjabi.
Asenjo discovered his pas-
sion for this region of India 
and this language through his 
involvement with the Carne-
gie Mellon Bhangra team and 
through Associate Professor 
of History Nico Slate’s course 
“India through Film.” At this 
point in time, Asenjo’s only 
exposure to Punjabi has been 
through weekly attendance 
at a Sikh temple in Monro-
eville. His choice of Punjabi 
comes from an appreciation 
of the culture surrounding 
it, which he has only expe-
rienced secondhand to this 
point. He looks forward to 
learning the language and 
absorbing the traditions for 
himself this summer.
CMU sophomore Ian Asenjo wins Critical Language Scholarship from State Dept.
Professor Manuela Veloso appointed as head of Machine Learning Department
Dean of the School of 
Computer Science An-
drew Moore announced on 
Wednesday March 23 that 
Herbert A. Simon University 
Professor of Computer Sci-
ence Manuela Veloso would 
become the new head of the 
the Machine Learning De-
partment. Stepping down 
from the position is E. Fred-
kin University Professor Tom 
Mitchell, who was the de-
partment’s founding head.
Veloso has been a mem-
ber of the Carnegie Mellon 
community since she earned 
her Ph.D. in computer sci-
ence here in 1992. Since 
then she has led the Carne-
gie Mellon robot soccer team 
to ?ve world championships 
in its league and has also 
developed the Cobot service 
robots. Her research has 
challenged her to continu-
ally improve robots’ ability 
to independently plan and 
execute tasks, and learn and 
cooperate with a team under 
challenging circumstances.
She co-founded the 
International RoboCup Fed-
eration and until 2014, Ve-
loso was the president of the 
Association for the Advance-
ment of Arti?cial Intelli-
gence. Also in 2014, she was 
given the distinction of Uni-
versity Professor, the high-
est honor the university can 
give its faculty. She has also 
long advocated for women 
in computer science. Last fall 
in Houston, Texas she pre-
sented the keynote address 
at the annual Grace Hop-
per Celebration of Women 
in Computing.
Dean Moore expressed his 
utmost con?dence in Veloso 
for the position in a press 
release on Wednesday: “Her 
knowledge of all aspects of 
AI and her dedication make 
her the perfect person to 
lead MLD now that machine 
learning has emerged as 
a major component of the 
world’s economy.”

Professor collects unique new item for Austen exhibit
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
Carnegie Mellon University 
professor of literary studies 
Kristina Straub has long held 
an admiration of classic lit-
erature. With the opening of 
her new exhibit titled “Will & 
Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, 
and the Cult of celebrity,” co-
curated with Janine Barchas, 
an English professor at the 
University of Texas, it is safe 
to say that William Shake-
speare and Jane Austen are 
at the top of this list. This 
exhibit is a part of the Fol-
ger Shakespeare Library and 
features many unique items 
that connect back to these 
authors. Earlier this month, 
it was announced that a new 
item will be part of this exhib-
it’s collection: an iconic shirt 
worn by Colin Firth in one of 
the most famous Pride and 
Prejudice screen adaptations.
Though published in the 
early 19th century, Jane Aus-
ten’s Pride and Prejudice still 
lives on as one of the most 
recognized titles in English 
literature. As is often the case, 
with great literature comes 
potentially great screen ad-
aptations. One of the most fa-
mous Pride and Prejudice ad-
aptations debuted in 1995 as 
a 6-part mini series starring 
Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle 
as Mr. Darcy and Elizabeth 
Bennet, respectively. It has 
been praised as one of the 
most faithful Austen adapta-
tions to date, which can likely 
be attributed to its rather 
long screen time, allowing 
the portrayal of more faith-
ful content. Even for those 
that have not had the oppor-
tunity to watch this adapta-
tion, it seems that many are 
strangely familiar with the 
image of Colin Firth, as Mr. 
Darcy, emerging from a pond 
in a wet, skin hugging, white 
t-shirt. Although, as previ-
ously stated, this adaptation 
is quite faithful, this scene is 
nowhere to be found in Aus-
ten’s novel, but still lives on 
as one of the most famous 
images from this Austen 
adaptation.
This new item, titled as 
“The Shirt,” will be placed in 
Straub and Barchas’ “Will & 
Jane: Shakespeare, Austen, 
and the Cult of Celebrity” ex-
hibition starting this August.
The exhibition aims to 
look at the legacies of Austen 
and Shakespeare and how 
their works and lives con-
tinue to impact us today. On 
the exhibit’s website, Straub 
and Barchas note that one 
way both authors’ lives paral-
lel each other today is in the 
portrayal of their works in 
screen adaptations and how 
this has increased the popu-
larity and approachability 
of their stories for modern 
viewers. In addition to the 
1995 adaptation, Pride and 
Prejudice and Zombieswas 
released earlier this year as 
a unique portrayal of the 
struggle of ?nding suitable 
matches in the world of the 
undead. Other notable ad-
aptations of Austen’s and 
Shakespeare’s works include-
Shakespeare Undead, Clueless, 
Baz Luhrmann’s Romeo + Ju-
liet, and many others.
In an interview with The 
New York Times, Barchas stat-
ed, “The shirt seemed like a 
celebrity object that demon-
strated the kind of fun people 
have with Austen as an au-
thor ... it exempli?es the kind 
of play that is central to our 
whole exhibition.”
This item will be among 
other rarities, such as a scarf 
featuring Austen’s family 
tree, and wood collected from 
Shakespeare’s birthplace.
“Will & Jane: Shake-
speare, Austen, and the Cult 
of Celebrity” is part of the 
Folger Shakespeare Library 
in Washington, D.C. The ex-
hibit will be open from Aug. 6 
to Nov. 6 this year and is free 
to the public.
Hunt Institute presents newGreat Expectations exhibit
DEBORAH CHU
Assistant News Editor
The Hunt Institute for 
Botanical Documentation’s 
latest exhibition, Great Expec-
tations, is displayed on the 
?fth ?oor of Hunt Library, and 
will remain until June 30. The 
exhibition features artworks 
from 36 historical and contem-
porary artists that illustrate 
plants at different moments 
of development, according to 
each artist’s personal observa-
tions. According to the exhibit, 
the name refers to the “great 
expectation in the promise 
and energy held within a bud 
or a seed.” The gallery is free 
and open to the public, and 
the exhibition is open Monday 
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 
noon and from 1 to 5 p.m. It 
is also open on Sunday from 
1 to 4 p.m.
At the entrance of the 
exhibition, a sign describes 
the series as “phases of this 
continuous cycle of plant 
development … beautifully 
illustrated with collection 
items.” On display around a 
large room with mahogany-
colored walls and ?oors are 
framed pieces of art that depict 
?owers and plants lit by care-
fully placed overhead lights. 
This evokes a quiet and serene 
atmosphere. Each of the pieces 
of art are accompanied by a de-
scription, and are organized by 
the stage of a plant’s lifecycle 
they re?ect. Each phase, from 
“seed” to “?owering” to “de-
clining,” to name a few, is indi-
cated by a well-chosen quote.
While most students recog-
nize Hunt Library as a place for 
buckling down to study, many 
students are unaware of the 
existence of the Hunt Institute 
for Botanical Documentation’s 
gallery on the top ?oor. The 
Hunt Institute for Botanical 
Documentation is a research 
division of Carnegie Mellon 
University that specializes 
in the history of botany and 
plant science, and serves an 
international scienti?c com-
munity through research and 
documentation, according to 
its website.
Originally dedicated in 
1961 as the Rachel McMas-
ters Miller Hunt Botanical Li-
brary, the Hunt Institute for 
Botanical Documentation has 
grown to boast a vast collec-
tion of books, images, manu-
scripts, portraits, data ?les, 
and publications, across four 
departments: Archives, Art, 
Bibliography, and the Library. 
The Art Department organizes 
two exhibitions a year, as well 
as a revolving sequence of in-
ternational travel exhibitions 
on loan to museums, galleries, 
and botanical gardens.
In the fall of 2016, the Hunt 
Institute will host the 15th 
International Exhibition of 
Botanical Art and Illustration, 
which will start Sept. 15 and 
run until Dec. 15.
Judge Ginsburg discusses the late Justice Antonin Scalia
the Constitution. He was an 
unwavering advocate of the 
principle that, “context is ev-
erything and the context of 
the Constitution tells us not 
to expect nitpicking detail 
and to give words and phras-
es an expansive rather than 
a narrow interpretation.” He 
believed “every issue of law 
resolved by a federal judge 
involves an interpretation 
of text” and that the idea of 
a living Constitution “frus-
trates the whole process of a 
written Constitution.” Judge 
Ginsburg defended original-
ism by clearly distinguishing 
that, “the great divide with 
regards to constitutional in-
terpretation is not between 
the Framers’ intent and ob-
jective meaning, but rather 
between original meaning, 
whether derived from the 
Framers’ intent or not, and 
the current.”
With the progression of 
his lecture, it became appar-
ent that Judge Ginsburg and 
Justice Scalia share tremen-
dously similar outlooks of 
legal philosophy, including a 
disdain toward the idea of a 
“living Constitution.” Judge 
Ginsburg de?ned this con-
cept to be a “body of law that, 
unlike normal statutes, grows 
and changes from age to age 
in order to meet the needs of 
changing society,” and noted 
that judges have the author-
ity to determine those needs 
and ?nd the changing law. 
He said that with this notion, 
common law would prevail 
with an in?nitely powerful 
comeback and an in?uence 
to overturn statutes passed 
by the legislature. He hinted 
at a possible imbalance that 
this would cause between the 
three branches of our federal 
government.
In ending his lecture, the 
judge cautioned that continu-
ing to conform to the evolving 
standards of decency would 
allow the courts to essen-
tially rewrite the Constitution 
in the way that the major-
ity wants. He concluded on a 
powerful note that this itself 
would be the end of the Bill of 
Rights as society has known 
it. Judge Ginsburg was enor-
mously successful in both 
relaying Justice Scalia’s legal 
view in an impartial light, 
and illustrating the cumber-
some nature of the United 
States Constitution. He was 
also able to successfully con-
vey his personal legal phi-
losophy without imposing his 
opinions on the audience, but 
rather offering unobtrusive 
yet insightful commentary 
throughout his discussion.

During last week’s Student 
Government debates, candi-
dates for Student Body Presi-
dent (SBP) and Student Body 
Vice President (SBVP) hewed 
close to their posted platforms 
while ?elding questions on 
some of Carnegie Mellon’s 
most talked-about issues.
The debates, which are 
hosted annually by The Tartan 
in conjunction with Student 
Government, challenged can-
didates to justify their stated 
platforms while responding 
to moderator and audience 
questions about issues such as 
the university’s stress culture 
and sexual assault and rela-
tionship violence prevention 
(SARVP).
On the right side of McCon-
omy Auditorium’s stage sat ju-
nior economics major Vaasavi 
Unnava, running for SBP, and 
junior computer science major 
Aaron Gutierrez, running for 
SBVP.
The pair emphasized the 
weight of their combined ex-
perience in Student Govern-
ment throughout the debate, 
and highlighted work that 
they had each done across 
campus to improve student 
life. Their campaign, branded 
as “Vaas and Aaron 2016,” is 
built on university-wide ?scal 
transparency, a “model for so-
cial change,” and Student Gov-
ernment transparency.
When asked why ?scal 
transparency is important, Un-
nava said that when she was 
part of Undergraduate Stu-
dent Senate as Business Affairs 
Committee Chair, she realized 
that she didn’t know what her 
tuition was being used for. “I 
think a big part of why we put 
this in our platform is having 
ownership over the changes 
that are made on our campus,” 
Unnava said.
Next were junior chemical 
engineering and engineering 
& public policy double major 
Trevor Hadick and ?rst-year 
decision science major Micah 
Rabin. Hadick, the current 
Student Body Vice President 
of Organizations (SBVPO) is 
running for SBP, while Rabin 
is running for SBVP.
As part of his current role, 
Hadick chairs the Commit-
tee on Student Organizations 
(CoSO) as well as the Univer-
sity Center Allocations Board 
(UCAB). Rabin is director 
of mature organizations on 
CoSO, as well as a sister of 
Kappa Alpha Theta.
“The biggest piece is the 
actual education,” Hadick 
said when asked about the 
inclusion of education and 
awareness on his platform. 
“There are a number of ways 
that education can happen 
— not all of them are in the 
classroom, and not all of them 
come from teachers ... It’s not 
like [there’s] one education 
method or type that will work 
best for [everyone].”
Rabin noted that she and 
Hadick are currently in talks 
to reform the university’s In-
terpretation and Argument 
class, which is required for all 
undergraduate students.
Junior professional writing 
and economics dual degree 
candidate Barbara Samaniego 
is running for SBP with sopho-
more economics major Ra-
heela Ahsan as her running 
mate. Their platform focuses 
on making improvements to 
University Health Services, 
among other reforms focused 
on student health and safety.
If they are elected, Sa-
maniego and Ahsan plan to 
host a series of narrowly fo-
cused town halls to garner stu-
dent input. “In these themed 
town halls, attendance would 
be encouraged because each 
one would center around a 
social issue,” Samaniego said. 
“Then students would come 
to discuss that issue, and get 
a chance to actually offer their 
criticisms for the school. We 
will also have an online public 
forum for people who can’t 
come to these town halls.”
The last pair of running 
mates included junior statis-
tics major Mike McCaffrey, 
who is running for SBP, and 
sophomore mathematical sci-
ences major Olivia Canniz-
zaro, who is running for SBVP. 
McCaffrey and Cannizzaro 
emphasized their willingness 
to work with students going 
forward to make improve-
ments to student life in the 
realms of dining, health, and 
“global engagement.”
“We’ll have an open-door 
policy, we’ll be constantly 
available, we’ll give out our 
cell phone numbers, emails, 
whatever it takes,” McCaffrey 
said about his and Canniz-
zaro’s plan to revamp Student 
Government of?ce hours. 
“What we want to do is foster 
these kinds of relationships 
with people so we can create 
something together. We real-
ize that we can’t do everything 
by ourselves — we can’t attend 
to all of these needs if we don’t 
know them.”
At the end of the two-hour 
debate, spectators were im-
pressed by many of the can-
didates. Srishti Jain, junior 
statistics major and Commu-
nications Committee Chair 
of Student Senate, was glad 
that many of the candidates 
recognized and understood 
the value of the passion that 
de?nes the Carnegie Mel-
lon community. “Everyone at 
Carnegie Mellon is passionate, 
and that’s something you hear 
all the time,” Jain, who is the 
public relations manager for 
Unnava and Gutierrez’s cam-
paign, said. “And I don’t think 
in the past the Student Body 
President and Vice President 
have made conscious efforts to 
tap into organizations or indi-
vidual students’ passions, but 
I think more candidates this 
year are trying to do that.”

Health care is the policy 
area where both the parties 
and individual candidates 
are farthest apart. Democrats 
tend to favor federal health 
insurance. Republicans think 
this is unnecessary spending 
that drives up costs of health 
products. While Republicans 
are already furious about 
Obamacare — an act nick-
named after President Barack 
Obama that allowed states to 
expand Medicaid access if they 
pleased. Republicans want to 
remove the restriction on sell-
ing health insurance across 
state lines, while Democrats 
think that incentivizes states 
to deregulate health care until 
it’s completely worthless in or-
der to encourage health insur-
ance companies to headquar-
ter themselves in their states.
Inside the parties, it has be-
come one of the only topics at 
the forefront for both Demo-
crats and Republicans.
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX)
Cruz vehemently wants to 
“repeal and replace” Obam-
acare. He often makes sure 
people know he won’t forget 
parts and will repeal every 
single word of the health care 
law. His replacement plan has 
three points.
Cruz’s ?rst point is to allow 
health insurers to sell across 
state lines to create a national-
ly competitive market. In the-
ory, this will drive down costs, 
especially in sparsely populat-
ed states, as state health insur-
ers have more competition.
His second point is to ex-
pand the use of health savings 
accounts, which is sort of like 
a tax-free bank account that 
people with high deductible 
plans can use. These accounts 
contain pre-tax income that 
someone can use to spend on 
health care only. It is some-
thing like a tax credit for hav-
ing a high-deductible plan.
His third point is to de-
link health insurance from 
employers. This should have 
three bene?ts. One, it opens 
up many more options to peo-
ple buying health insurance 
since they are not restricted 
to their employer’s options. 
Two, it drives up wages be-
cause companies do not have 
to pay for health care ben-
e?ts. Three, it allows people 
to move jobs more freely and 
makes the labor market more 
dynamic and ef?cient.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich was one of the 
only Republican governors 
to expand Medicaid access in 
his state in accordance with 
Obamacare. Kasich also calls 
access to affordable health 
insurance a high priority. 
However, he feels Obamacare 
did not solve the problem of 
Americans paying fees for 
health services, which creates 
an incentive to provide care 
but not necessarily effective 
care.
Kasich has moved Ohio to-
wards episode-based health 
care payments. This is cred-
ited with some reduction of 
health care costs in Ohio. It 
is a similar idea to many pro-
visions in Obamacare, which 
attempt to base incentives on 
results instead of on what is 
provided. Kasich believes his 
model in Ohio would be an im-
provement on the current sys-
tem created in Obamacare. He 
also wants to improve primary 
care by expanding access to 
primary care physicians and 
making regular doctor’s vis-
its a key aspect of health care 
plans. He believes this cuts the 
most costs because it makes 
it less likely that people will 
need to cover major expenses 
for catastrophic injuries and 
illnesses in the future.
Steak tycoon Donald Trump
Like many Republicans, the 
?rst bullet point in Trump’s 
health care plan is to repeal 
Obamacare, particularly the 
individual mandate.Marching 
right along with conservative 
orthodoxy, his second bullet 
point is allowing Americans 
to buy health insurance across 
state lines.
Many observers are calling 
Trump’s proposal quintessen-
tially Republican. He wants to 
bring free market reforms to 
health care by increasing price 
transparency from healthcare 
providers, thereby enabling 
price comparisons by consum-
ers and lowering the barriers 
for drug providers to begin 
marketing drugs in the U.S.
His tactics to cover low in-
come Americans are also stan-
dard conservative fare. He 
would like to trade out Obam-
acare’s tax subsidies with tax 
deductions for an individual’s 
health insurance premium 
payments, and shift Medic-
aid power toward the states 
by giving them block grants. 
It would be up to the state to 
decide what services to fund.
Finally, Trump wants to 
expand the use of health sav-
ings accounts similar to Cruz. 
Combined with the tax cred-
its Trump has proposed for 
deductibles, this would mean 
the vast majority of Americans 
would end up with no income 
tax liability were Trump to 
take of?ce.
Above all, though, Trump 
claims he will grow the econ-
omy so that people will have 
jobs and make suf?cient in-
come to pay for their health 
insurance without govern-
ment help.
Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton
This is not Clinton’s ?rst 
rodeo when it comes to health 
care on a national scale. Clin-
ton had a major in?uence on 
her husband Bill Clinton’s 
health care remodel in 1993. 
Harkening back to those days, 
Clinton continues to battle in-
surance and drug companies, 
saying she would want “au-
thority to block or modify un-
reasonable health insurance 
rate increases” and hold drug 
companies accountable.
Clinton has aligned her-
self with Obama on health-
care, promising to protect 
and build on the base of 
Obamacare. She is seeking to 
expand the Obamacare ex-
changes to include illegal im-
migrant families, and wants 
to cap the patient’s share of 
doctor bills and prescription 
drug costs. She has also been 
at odds with Obama about a 
tax on high-cost, employer-
sponsored insurance, which 
she would like to repeal. She is 
also seeking tax credits, up to 
$2,500 a year for an individual 
and $5,000 for a family, if out-
of-pocket health costs exceed 
5 percent of income. Many of 
these changes are designed to 
lower patient copays and de-
ductibles, a key running point 
for Clinton.
She has also made women’s 
reproductive rights and access 
to abortion a fundamental 
part of her campaign, and in-
tends to support Planned Par-
enthood and combat restric-
tions on abortion such as the 
Hyde Amendment.
Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT)
Sanders is proposing a 
complete overhaul of the 
American health care system 
in the fashion of the universal 
health care plans found in Eu-
rope and Canada. It would be 
a single-payer system, mean-
ing a government agency 
would run the ?nancing side 
of health care, but treatment 
and delivery would remain 
mainly in the private sector 
with the same doctors and 
hospital systems. People seek-
ing treatment would simply 
go to the doctor, show their 
insurance card, and receive 
treatment without any copays 
or deductibles.
Sanders’ plan would na-
tionalize the health insurance 
industry, but health service 
providers would still be con-
sidered a private industry.
Instead of private insur-
ance charges, Sanders propos-
es raising the money through 
increased taxes and spending 
cuts. He will increase the em-
ployer portion of the payroll 
tax by 6.2 percent, impose a 
2.2 percent income tax paid 
per household, and start a 
bevy of taxes on the rich, in-
cluding increased income 
tax and more comprehensive 
capital gains and estate taxes. 
He also hopes to cut national 
healthcare spending by $400 
billion.
In addition to these big 
structural changes, Sanders 
is also focusing on improv-
ing mental health care access 
in the U.S, particularly for 
veterans, and maintaining 
food stamp and nutrition pro-
grams. These costs prevent 
people from having to come 
in for more expensive emer-
gency care later in the proc-
cess. He and Clinton agree 
on holding drug companies 
accountable for keeping drug 
prices low.

Student Body Presidential candidates face off in debate
How CMU votes:The Tartan polls student opinions
BARBARA SAMANIEGO
Staffwriter
Millennials are currently 
the largest generation in our 
country, yet they have the 
smallest voter turnout over-
all. This may be due in part to 
the pervading sense of apa-
thy and a large divide in the 
political opinions of younger 
and older voters. Millennials 
also feel more separated from 
political campaigns, as most 
are not targeted towards 
them.
College students, howev-
er, tend to be more politically 
involved, and they statisti-
cally tend to favor more left-
wing policy. Does this still 
hold at Carnegie Mellon?
I am currently conduct-
ing a university wide poll to 
see how Carnegie Mellon 
student’s political opinions 
differ from those of the rest 
of the country and why. To 
begin, I ask if that student 
thinks that they themselves 
are politically involved, then 
I ask several questions about 
their opinions on popular 
policy issues.
Carnegie Mellon students 
in particular are often criti-
cized for their exceedingly 
apathetic attitude towards 
politics and social issues. My 
goal is to determine if that is 
truly the case. Why does this 
notion exist, and how true is 
it really?
Junior international rela-
tions and statistics double 
major Victor Gonzalez, presi-
dent of CMU Democrats, be-
lieves that Carnegie Mellon 
student apathy is in part due 
to the culture of the univer-
sity. Gonzalez believes that 
Carnegie Mellon’s stress 
culture contributes to a lack 
of political inclination, ex-
plaining that students are 
already “too busy to focus on 
the outside world.” He also 
hypothesizes that Carnegie 
Mellon focuses so intensely 
on technology and quantita-
tive ?elds that students do 
not feel as though anything 
pertaining to the humanities 
applies to them.
In my opinion, Carnegie 
Mellon does indeed seem to 
discourage students from any 
sort of political involvement. 
The university emphasizes 
coursework and grades more 
than other universities, and 
offers little to spur interest 
and educate students about 
the surrounding world. Thus, 
students are not inclined to 
believe politics and current 
political issues hold much im-
portance in their own lives. 
Carnegie Mellon’s heavy em-
phasis on STEM also turns 
students away from engaging 
in politics, since politics is a 
discipline more closely asso-
ciated with the humanities.
Due to Carnegie Mellon’s 
distinct culture, students 
at the university may have 
very different opinions than 
their fellow voters (even 
millennials).
I asked Gonzalez if he felt 
as though there may be dif-
ferences in how Carnegie 
Mellon students vote. He 
explained that the univer-
sity’s emphasis on quantita-
tive ?elds may encourage 
students to focus more on 
military surveillance and 
technology.
Otherwise, he believes 
that Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents tend to hold the same 
opinions as other millennials.
“Between CMU students 
and other millennials, there 
is probably not much dif-
ference [in opinion]. Just 
more political apathy,” he 
concluded.

Sanders dominates in the west, but Clinton takes Arizona
CALEB GLICKMAN
Junior Staffwriter
This week, the Democratic 
primary saw three states vote 
on what the news cycle de-
cided to call “Western Tues-
day.” Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT) won caucuses in both 
Utah and Idaho with mar-
gins of victory exceeding 50 
points. Former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton won the 
Arizona primary by 18 points. 
Because the entire Demo-
cratic primary process awards 
delegates proportionally, Sec-
retary Clinton gained 55 del-
egates from the three states, 
but Senator Sanders won the 
week with 73 delegates.
Although Sanders won 
more delegates, it does little 
to cut into Clinton’s large del-
egate lead. Currently, without 
superdelegates, Clinton has 
1,220 to Sanders’ 920. With 
current superdelegates’ cur-
rent preferences, Clinton has 
1,690 to Sanders’ 946. One 
must obtain 2,382 delegates 
to get the nomination.
The Sanders campaign 
hopes to use the wins this 
week to garner some momen-
tum for primaries this Satur-
day in Hawaii, Alaska, and 
Washington. All three of these 
contests are caucuses, where 
Sanders has consistently 
performed better. He hopes 
to continue the momentum 
into Wisconsin on April 5, 
and then work a close race in 
the Pennsylvania primary on 
April 26. It appears that even 
with a de?cit of delegates, 
Sanders will be staying in the 
race to obtain as many del-
egates as possible going into 
the convention.
However, Clinton’s cam-
paign is looking to keep its 
lead in delegates as the con-
tests continue. With all the 
primaries being proportional, 
it is increasingly dif?cult for 
Sanders to catch up if Clin-
ton keeps winning delegates. 
Clinton hopes to do well in 
Wisconsin on April 5, and 
hopes to win a large share of 
the 247 delegates from the 
state where she once held a 
Senate seat, New York. She 
needs 693 more delegates 
(superdelegates included) to 
clinch the nomination.
Several issues plagued 
Clinton’s victory in Arizona. 
Sanders supporters in par-
ticular also complained that 
the race was called with 
only 1 percent of precincts 
reporting, and thousands of 
people still waiting to even 
cast their vote. Many voters 
also reported serious proce-
dural issues; some registered 
Democrats couldn’t be found 
on the register and were not 
allowed to vote. In addition, 
only 60 polling places were 
used as opposed to 200 in the 
previous presidential primary 
season. The Mayor of Phoe-
nix, Greg Stanton submitted 
a request to Attorney Gen-
eral Loretta Lynch to launch 
a federal investigation of 
the circumstances. Arizona’s 
Republican Governor, Doug 
Ducey, called the situation 
“unacceptable.” Still, others 
like Democratic Rep. Ruben 
Gallego, blamed the “voter 
suppression” on the Republi-
can government in the state, 
and called on them to ?x the 
voting problems. Republican 
of?cials said they lowered the 
number of polling places to 
save money.
Sanders was able to sweep 
the states that came in early on 
Saturday, winning in Wash-
ington, Alaska, and Hawaii. 
Sanders managed to clear 70 
percent in Washington and 80 
percent in Alaska, his biggest 
win to date.
Republican primary gets personal as western states vote
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
With the Republican ?eld 
down to just three candidates, 
the primary season is ?nally 
starting to wind down as 
businessman Donald Trump, 
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX), and 
Ohio Governor John Kasich 
campaigned for votes in Utah 
and Arizona’s primaries on 
Tuesday.
In the Arizona primary, 
Trump took ?rst place with 
47.1 percent of the vote, cap-
turing all 58 delegates up for 
grabs. Cruz came in second 
with 24.9 percent of the vote. 
Kasich ?nished in fourth place 
with 10 percent of the vote, 
as absentee ballots cast for 
Senator Marco Rubio (R–FL) 
helped give him 13.3 percent 
of the vote despite having 
dropped out of the race before 
the contest.
In the Utah caucus, Cruz 
took ?rst place with 69.2 per-
cent of the vote, gaining all 
40 delegates. Kasich came in 
second with 16.8 percent of 
the vote, and Trump earned 
14 percent.
944 delegates remain 
on the table in the primary 
race, and only Trump or 
Cruz can possibly obtain 
the 1,237 needed to win the 
nomination without a con-
tested convention. Trump 
currently leads the ?eld with 
739 delegates, 598 shy of the 
nomination. Cruz is quite far 
behind at 465. He would have 
to get an unrealistic 772 more 
delegates to avoid a ?ght for 
the nomination. Kasich cur-
rently only has 143, which is 
23 less than Rubio. With the 
number of unpledged del-
egates declining as primaries 
continue, Kasich can no lon-
ger win the nomination with-
out a ?ght at the Republican 
National Convention.
Over the past week, Re-
publican politics have re-
volved around two topics: the 
terror attacks in Belgium’s 
capital of Brussels and the 
wives of Trump and Cruz. 
On the more serious matter, 
Republicans have issued the 
standard talking points when 
it comes to terrorist attacks: 
insist on taking stronger ac-
tions against terrorists, decry 
the number of refugees com-
ing from Syria and the Middle 
East in general, and criticize 
President Obama. Cruz in par-
ticular has been the most out-
spoken, promising to defeat 
“radical Islamic terrorism” 
and condemning President 
Obama for remaining in Cuba 
amid the ongoing fallout from 
the terrorist attacks. Trump 
emphasized the need to “close 
up our borders” to defend 
against such attacks in the 
U.S. Only Kasich decided to 
emphasize the need to help al-
lies “identify, root out, and de-
stroy the perpetrators of such 
acts of evil.”
On a more personal level of 
politics, Trump and Cruz have 
engaged in a spat over their 
wives. An anti-Trump super 
Political Action Committee 
(PAC) called Make America 
Awesome produced a Face-
book advertisement targeted 
to Mormons which showed a 
photo of Melania Trump pos-
ing nude. Trump immediately 
attacked Cruz, threatening to 
“spill the beans on [Cruz’s] 
wife.” Trump later tweeted 
out a side by side image of Me-
lania in a glamorous pose and 
Heidi Cruz with an un?atter-
ing grimace. Cruz has repeat-
edly claimed no af?liation 
with the super PAC, labeling 
Trump a coward for going af-
ter his wife.
Gone are the days of party 
camaraderie when Trump and 
Rubio both blasted The Wash-
ington Post for publishing a 
political cartoon portraying 
Cruz’s daughters as trained 
monkeys. Instead, the ?ght 
between Trump and Cruz 
has devolved into familial 
mudslinging, truly the most 
important issue when it comes 
to deciding the chief executive 
of the nation.
Looking ahead, the next 
site of the race lies in Wiscon-
sin, the home state of some 
prominent Republicans like 
Speaker of the House Paul 
Ryan and Governor Scott 
Walker. Both Ryan and Walk-
er have had negative attitudes 
toward the frontrunner, who 
currently has a virtual tie with 
Cruz in recent polls.
Wisconsin is a moderate, 
midwestern state similar to 
places like Ohio and Michi-
gan, where all three remain-
ing candidates have been 
overperforming to date.
The movement to stop 
Trump from getting the dele-
gates needed to win the nomi-
nation is growing, counting 
on the open primary on April 
5 to help slow down Trump. 
Further ahead, New York’s 
primary on April 19 may have 
some effect before April 26 
sees Connecticut, Delaware, 
Maryland, Pennsylvania, and 
Rhode Island voting.
Republican voters in 
Pennsylvania looking to help 
or hinder Trump have until 
March 28 to register in time 
for the primary election.

JOSHUA BROWN
SciTech Editor
Money is always a 
contentious issue. Nearly ev-
ery individual with an income 
knows the bittersweet experi-
ence of getting a paycheck, 
only to have a portion of their 
earnings whisked away to 
God-knows-where. Without 
knowing what this money 
goes to, or whom it helps, 
they might even become re-
sentful of the organization 
which takes their money.
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent of Finance (SBVPF) 
hopeful and sophomore sta-
tistics major Harit Agrawala, 
is acutely aware of this prob-
lem. A central component of 
his platform for this coming 
year is to remedy this lack 
of communication between 
the Joint Funding Commit-
tee (JFC) and all 300+ orga-
nizations whose funding it 
oversees. His plan comes in 
three parts. Agrawala would 
like ?rst and foremost to raise 
awareness among students 
about the JFC and what it ac-
tually does; second, he aims 
to raise monetary transpar-
ency within the organization 
and to increase communica-
tion between the JFC and the 
organizations for which it 
works; and ?nally, Agrawala 
wants to foster these relation-
ships and to eliminate the 
annual stress which organiza-
tions face when considering 
the amount of funding they 
will receive from the JFC.
Agrawala’s ?rst platform 
point is to raise awareness 
about the JFC and to expand 
its members. One of the 
biggest examples of how an 
increased awareness would 
help the student body is al-
lowing students to better un-
derstand how their activities 
fee is distributed. “There’s 
a common misconception,” 
Agrawala said, “that it all 
goes to the Activities Board.” 
In reality, the money raised 
from every student’s activities 
fee — about $1.25 million, 
according to Agrawala — is 
collected by the JFC and dis-
tributed among the 300 orga-
nizations whose funding the 
JFC oversees. Agrawala also 
believes that the JFC could 
bene?t from increased mem-
bership. The Joint Funding 
Committee is largely a place 
for students with a vested 
interest in ?nance to mean-
ingfully impact their campus 
community, and it’s rather 
unfortunate that so few peo-
ple are aware of it.
His second platform point 
is to remedy the communica-
tion problems which often 
arise between the JFC and 
the organizations with which 
it works. By communicat-
ing with organizations and 
keeping this open dialogue, 
Agrawala believes that the 
JFC can better understand 
what the organizations need 
and what they do, and the JFC 
can better meet their needs. 
One of the ways he intends to 
make this happen is by “being 
able to provide them with ?-
nancial advice, if they need 
that. Should an organization 
not have that, we would be 
available,” Agrawala said.
The third way in which 
Agrawala would like to im-
prove relations between the 
JFC and organizations is to 
eliminate the stress organi-
zations feel over their budget 
situations for the following 
year.
In the past, the JFC would 
allow organizations to keep 
their income, but adjust their 
budgets accordingly for the 
coming year. In Harit’s plan, 
each organization would be 
able to keep 20 percent of its 
annual income, with the rest 
coming back to the JFC to be 
allocated all of the organiza-
tions. The goal is to “redis-
tribute [the funds] to orga-
nizations who are in debt or 
those who are looking to start 
up.” This plan “gives the JFC 
any cash that organizations 
are making in surplus.” One 
of the biggest issues expe-
rienced by the JFC in terms 
of creating budgets for the 
following years is that “orga-
nizations choose to hide the 
pro?ts they’re getting” be-
cause they’re often afraid that 
if they report too much fund-
ing, the JFC will give them a 
decreased budget. Also, the 
current system “makes orga-
nizations spend most of the 
time of fundraising rather 
than focusing on the goal of 
what the organization is,” 
since they apparently feel like 
they’re on their own in terms 
of funding.
With this system, funding 
would be dependable for all 
organizations and available 
to the many smaller organiza-
tions that don’t have quite the 
same pull as many of the larg-
er ones. This also ensures that 
organizations can keep 20 
percent of their total pro?ts 
and continue to grow through 
their own efforts.

Nina Fan seeks to make life easier for organizations as VPO
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
Sophomore statistics major 
Nina Fan is running for Stu-
dent Body Vice President for 
Organizations (SBVPO).
Fan’s platform consists of 
improving 25Live as well as 
improving Student Govern-
ment transparency, the re-
recognition process, collabo-
ration between organizations, 
and organizational support.
25Live, the application for 
reserving rooms on campus, is 
the thing Fan most visibly tar-
gets in her platform. “25Live 
is a great idea, you can book 
and reserve any room on cam-
pus,” Fan said. However, she 
acknowledged that replacing 
it completely might require 
multiple systems for different 
buildings, which would just be 
more work for people learning 
to use the systems. “If we can’t 
replace 25Live, we’re going 
to do something else. We are 
going to try to make it user-
friendlier because I know that 
that is the biggest issue that 
comes with 25Live. I’m going 
to work with [Cohon Center  
Director] Marcia [Gerwin] 
and work with CollegeNet — 
the provider for 25Live — and 
whoever else is involved at 
Carnegie Mellon and we are 
going to try to redesign it.”
Re-recognition and trans-
parency are also places Fan 
feels she can make improve-
ments. “Re-recognition a) is 
a tedious process, b) can get 
meticulous, and c) it takes 
somebody who really knows 
the process itself to make sure 
that your organization contin-
ues to be government recog-
nized. That’s a situation where 
it’s important to have some-
body there who knows how 
student government runs and 
how re-recognition runs,” Fan 
said. By improving transpar-
ency and the re-recognition 
process, she will make it easier 
to both know how these pro-
cesses work, and to navigate 
the processes themselves.
Fan has also spoken about 
the importance of both publi-
cizing and utilizing the Collab-
orative Funding Committee, 
a body that funds joint events 
between organizations. This 
would help the Carnegie Mel-
lon community become closer 
through facilitating coopera-
tion between student groups.
“I’ve been in Student 
Government since my [?rst] 
year here and I’ve been on 
Committee on Student Orga-
nizations since my ?rst year 
and I’ve worked with the 
past two SBVPOs very closely 
[and] I’ve had a lot of experi-
ence with allocations,” Fan 
said on why she decided to 
run. She feels her experience 
in Student Government is nec-
essary for an effective term as 
SBVPO. “On top of all that,” 
she added, “I’ve been very in-
volved in organizations like 
Doctors of Carnegie Society 
— which I was vice president 
of — and the Undergraduate 
Market Organization, which I 
was the vice president of pro-
grams of.” She says that know-
ing both the ins and outs of 
Student Government and be-
ing involved in organizations 
makes her quali?ed to know 
what is required of the SBVPO 
and what will help improve or-
ganizations’ experiences.
When asked to summarize 
her candidacy, Fan said “Vote 
for who can do the job best 
and who can represent you 
and the rest of the student 
body the best. I am the most 
experienced, caring, and per-
sonable candidate.”
Neal Choudhary puts years in JFC at center of platform
Harit Agrawala focuses on public understanding of JFC
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent of Finance (SBVPF) is a 
large role with a large respon-
sibility. This person oversees 
the allocations of over $1.2 
million by the Joint Fund-
ing Committee (JFC) to all 
of the student organizations 
on campus. Neal Choudhary, 
a sophomore majoring in 
?nance, is running for this 
position and draws heav-
ily on his previous experience 
serving on JFC for two years 
to help shape his platform. 
“The title is ?nance but this 
is mostly just an allocations 
process. That’s the best word 
for it. There’s not much ?-
nance involved other than the 
fact that it involves money, 
so I think that to be able to 
do this job you need to have 
experience.” After serving on 
JFC for two years, Choudhary 
decided to do something 
about the changes he wants 
to make. “I’ve learned a lot 
about the process as well 
as seen that there’s a lot of 
room for improvement. That’s 
where my platform comes 
in.” Choudhary breaks his 
platform down to three basic 
ideas: diversity, consistency, 
and transparency.
Choudhary wants to en-
sure that the needs of the 
entire campus are met by hav-
ing a diverse JFC. “First of all, 
each year in JFC the amount 
of membership changes. In 
past years it’s been 30 or 40, 
this year it’s been less.” His 
ideal JFC would have “around 
30 and 40” members. His 
reasoning behind this was 
that it’s “not too much so it 
doesn’t get too hectic, but it’s 
not too small that it’s biased.” 
Choundary focuses heavily on 
wanting the process to be ben-
e?cial for everyone. “I think 
that ?nding a good balance 
is very important and even 
more important than [that is] 
making sure that the mem-
bers are a fair representation 
of everyone on campus. We 
have many types of student 
[organizations] and it’s very 
diverse and that diversity 
should be represented within 
the members. We shouldn’t 
have all the members from 
one type of an [organization] 
they should be from all over 
the campus.”
He’s served under two 
very different leaders and 
has seen the JFC go in differ-
ent directions already. “Basi-
cally each year a new SBVPF 
comes in. They have a differ-
ent philosophy. They think 
that things should be differ-
ent and because of that you 
might just ?nd that the JFC 
budget allocation changes a 
lot. Some organizations get 
caught in the middle of it, 
and it’s really not their fault. 
I think there should be sta-
bility. You shouldn’t just do a 
180 one year, that shouldn’t 
keep happening.” This is why 
Choundary has made consis-
tency such a key element of 
his platform. He wants to en-
sure that the process is as easy 
for organizations as possible.
His ?nal platform is-
sue is transparency. “Every 
organization on campus is 
getting funding from [the 
JFC] and it matters a lot. It 
impacts you a lot more than 
you think it does. It’s kind of 
like a knowledge based pro-
cess. The organizations that 
know the most can reap the 
most bene?ts.” Choundary 
even proposed a JFC aware-
ness week just to keep orga-
nizations involved and knowl-
edgeable of the process. “I 
think to make it fair you have 
to make sure that everyone 
knows about it [by] improv-
ing communication and may-
be hosting a JFC awareness 
week where we host different 
events maybe we serve some 
food and people can come in, 
and we [can] talk to them.”
While Choundary does 
heavily rely on experience, 
what he really wants more 
than anything is for voters to 
make an informed decision. 
“I harp on experience, but I’m 
not attacking the other [can-
didate]. I would encourage 
all the voters to go out there, 
look at the platforms, talk 
to people that have been in-
volved, and vote for whoever 
you think is best. I’m not ask-
ing you to vote for me I’m ask-
ing you to vote for whoever 
you think is the most quali?ed 
candidate and I think that just 
getting involved is the best 
thing.”

When your stomach starts 
to rumble, and you feel a pit 
inside your stomach, you’re 
experiencing a biological 
drive: hunger. Your body is 
running out of food to break 
down, and it wants more, so it 
motivates you by making you 
uncomfortable. This motiva-
tion is what forces you to roll 
out of bed and cook yourself 
some breakfast. These bio-
logical drives are what allow 
our bodies to keep themselves 
in tip-top shape, to survive. 
They’re feelings that are only 
alleviated through actions, 
and they motivate us to act in 
ways which bene?t us. Other 
biological drives include the 
drive to procreate, to drink, 
to sleep, and, according to 
George Loewenstein, the 
Herbert A. Simon University 
Professor of Economics and 
Psychology at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, to make sense 
of the world. 
Loewenstein is interested 
in the idea that sense-making 
is a biological drive, just like 
hunger or thirst. In short, this 
drive toward sense-making 
is a “drive toward simpli-
?cation,” or the idea that 
the less complicated we can 
make things, the more eas-
ily we can understand them. 
Loewenstein believes that “an 
individual evaluates his life 
based on two major criteria: 
how good is it, and how much 
sense does it make?” 
Goodness, Loewenstein 
says, “can be evaluated many 
ways: how ful?lled a person 
feels, how generally content 
he feels on a daily basis,” and 
so on. But the second crite-
rion is far more interesting 
to Loewenstein. Just as we 
feel physically bad if we don’t 
eat, we “feel really bad if we 
suddenly feel like our lives 
or the world make less sense 
than they [previously] made.” 
This bad feeling is essentially 
our bodies’ way of telling us 
to act, to make sense of the 
world, and to restore the se-
curity we feel when we under-
stand what’s going on. 
Picture this: your life is a 
puzzle. Maybe one that de-
picts a ?eld of sun?owers 
or a picturesque lighthouse. 
You’re trucking away on this 
puzzle — you’ve got the bor-
der all put together, you’re 
starting to ?ll in the picture, 
and the ?nish line is in sight. 
To throw a wrench into the 
works, let’s say that one of the 
puzzle pieces breaks in half, 
followed by another, and an-
other, until there are sudden-
ly twice as many pieces to this 
puzzle, and the dif?culty’s just 
gone up exponentially. You’re 
probably not going to feel 
very good about this strange 
development; you might 
even ?ip the table dramati-
cally and storm off. This is 
an example of what Loewen-
stein calls “loss-aversion,” or 
that bad feeling we get when 
our lives make less sense. In 
this scenario, it would either 
motivate 
you to either 
put extra 
effort into 
the puzzle 
and ulti-
mately ?nish 
it — if you’re a 
competitive type — or 
to ?nd something else 
to occupy your time.
Loewenstein 
says that in the pro-
cess of sense-making, 
“pleasure and displea-
sure ... are geared to-
ward expectations of 
how much sense you hope 
to make.” When the puzzle 
magically becomes more dif?-
cult, the displeasure is largely 
a result of your previous ex-
pectations to make just a little 
sense — a pretty picture. That 
being said, the pleasure from 
?nishing the harder puzzle 
would be greater than that 
from ?nishing the easier one 
because there is more sense to 
be made from a more dif?cult 
process.  If we extrapolate 
this example from a puzzle 
to some sort of real-life prob-
lem — a dispute between 
friends, a dif?cult homework 
assignment, or a job search 
— we will largely ?nd that 
the pleasure from solving real 
problems is far higher than 
the pleasure from solving 
recreational ones. Loewen-
stein asserts that this is due 
to the fact that the “level of 
satisfaction is dependent on 
how much the new informa-
tion helps you make sense 
of your life.” Essentially, this 
means that your life will make 
more sense, be simpler, when 
you’ve completed a task, such 
as ?nding a job, which gives 
you some measure of security 
Synthetic bacteria able to survive with small gene amount
A biotech researcher and 
member of the USA Science 
and Engineering Festival’s 
Advisory Board, J. Craig Ven-
ter, along with a team of re-
searchers, published their 
?ndings on their synthesis of 
the ?rst bacterial cell. Known 
as JCVI-syn3.0, the bacteri-
um contained 473 genes, the 
minimal amount of genetic 
material that the researchers 
determined was needed for 
the bacterium to live. Lasting 
for ?ve years, the bacterium 
was ?rst created when the re-
searchers replicated the one 
of the smallest genomes in 
nature from M. mycoides, and 
transplanted the genome into 
another species, the Myco-
plasma capricolum. The point 
of this research is to note that 
an organism can survive and 
live a healthy life with only a 
small number of genes. If even 
a single one of these genes 
were taken out, the synthetic 
bacterium would fail to sur-
vive. Researchers only ex-
pected about 5 to 10 percent 
of these genes to be critically 
important, demonstrating the 
researchers’ lack of under-
standing of role of those genes 
as well as the minimal genetic 
requirements for life.

Super-eruptions in Yellowstone larger than expected
A team of U.S., British, and 
Danish collaborators found 
evidence that 12 giant, ancient 
eruptions that occurred in the 
Central Snake River Plain in 
Idaho were actually larger 
than was previously thought, 
rivaling the notorious erup-
tions that took place in Yellow-
stone millions of years ago. 
By employing whole rock 
and mineral chemistries, pal-
aeo-magnetic data, and radio-
isotopic dates, the researchers 
identi?ed individual eruption 
deposits and then correlated 
that data over larger regions.
According to one of the 
researchers, Tom Knott from 
the University of Leceister, the 
eruptions in Yellowstone were 
only a sample of the series of 
ancient super-eruptions ex-
tending along the Snake River 
from Oregon to Yellowstone. 
These eruptions are 
thought to have occurred in 
the past 16 million years. 
For example, one report 
suggests that an eruption in 
southern Idaho covered over 
14,000 kilometers-squared 
and 1.3 km, much greater 
than the super-eruption in Yel-
lowstone that had an eruption 
volume of 1,900 kilometers-
cubed.

New catalyst better at splitting water by 300 percent
Scientists at the SLAC Na-
tional Accelerator Laboratory 
and the University of Toronto 
have created a new kind of 
catalyst that can decompose 
water into hydrogen and oxy-
gen, a method that is used to 
store electricity generated by 
solar and wind power. 
The catalyst can decom-
pose water at a rate that is 
three times better than the 
previous record holder. Ac-
cording to Aleksandra Vo-
jvodic, a SLAC staff scientist, 
production of the catalyst 
does not require extremely 
advanced tools. 
Furthermore, the new cat-
alyst is also one of the most 
inexpensive on the market, as 
it is made of three abundant 
metals — iron, cobalt, and 
tungsten. 
Vojvodic and colleagues 
from the SUNCAT Center for 
Interface Science and Cataly-
sis used powerful computa-
tional tools to determine the 
effect an addition of tungsten 
has on catalyst’s activity. 
They then used their ?nd-
ings to develop a novel meth-
od to uniformly distribute 
the three metals by creating 
a gel that was later dried into 
powder.

Vegan diets could reduce climate change emissions
A study in the Proceedings 
of the National Academy of 
Sciences suggests that reduc-
ing the consumption of meat, 
while increasing the con-
sumption of fruits and vege-
tables, could lead to improved 
health and decreased carbon 
emissions. 
Researchers at Oxford Uni-
versity found that adoption 
of global guidelines on diet, 
which limits red meat and en-
courages produce consump-
tion, could prevent 5.1 million 
deaths per year and reduce 
food-related emissions by 29 
percent. 
Furthermore, a global 
adoption of a vegan diet 
would result in 8.1 million 
fewer deaths and a 70 per-
cent reduction in emissions. 
Additionally, dietary shifts 
could lead to monetary sav-
ings in healthcare. 
While the lead author and 
post-doctoral researcher at 
the Department of Population 
Health, Marco Springmann, 
states that it is not expected 
that everyone will become 
vegan, he said that switch-
ing to a more healthy and 
environmentally-friendly diet 
could lead to overall global 
improvement.

Microsoft’s teenage chatbot corrupted by Internet users
Last Thursday, Microsoft 
shut down its arti?cial intel-
ligence program Tay, which 
was a chatbot that learned 
how to interact with 18-24-
year olds through its con-
versations online, via plat-
forms like Twitter, Kik and 
GroupMe. Designed to be en-
gaging and entertaining, Tay 
could be contacted via her 
Twitter address and other on-
line platforms, including Kik 
or GroupMe. Within a day of 
Tay’s release, the chatbot be-
gan making racist and sexist 
comments as a result of abuse 
by some users. Others found 
that it was dif?cult to have 
substantial conversations 
with the chatbot about vari-
ous topics, including music 
and television. Microsoft has 
apologized for the in?amma-
tory comments and deleted 
most of the bot’s tweets. They 
covered up this move by say-
ing that Tay was tired and 
needed to rest.
While the the company is 
currently making some ad-
justments to the bot, many 
followers urge Microsoft to 
allow Tay to learn about what 
is right and wrong autono-
mously, rather than being 
interrupted mid-experiment.

Astronomers see huge supernova’s shockwave blast
From the Kepler Space 
Telescope, an international 
team of astronomers were 
able to see a shockwave for 
the ?rst time, due to the dis-
play of normal visible colors. 
The shockwave was seen 
near a red giant that was 270 
times the radius of the sun 
and was the smaller of two 
old stars that were being ob-
served by the astronomers. 
After running out of fuel, 
the star started to compress 
on its central core so much 
that a reciprocal, outward 
force was triggered, creat-
ing the explosion of an aging 
giant star that resulted in a 
shockwave.
In contrast, the other star, 
which had 400 times the ra-
dius of the sun, did not show 
signs of a shockwave. 
As stated by co-author 
Brad Tucker, from Australian 
National University, the re-
searchers believed that the 
larger size of the star made 
the escape of the shockwave 
more dif?cult. The discovery 
is currently in the process of 
being published in The Astro-
physical Journal.

Readability analyses are 
usually utilized by teachers 
to select appropriate read-
ing materials for students, 
but researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Language Tech-
nologies Institute, includ-
ing principle systems sci-
entist Maxine Eskenazi and 
graduate research assistant 
Elliot Schumacher, are in-
terested in applying read-
ability analysis methods 
to another area of natural 
language: presidential cam-
paign speeches. The read-
ability analyses of campaign 
speeches from the 2016 
United States presidential 
election campaign shows 
that the candidates’ choice 
of words generally ranged 
from an eighth-grade level 
to a tenth-grade level. The 
exception to this conclusion 
was businessman Donald 
Trump, who speaks at a 
seventh-grade level. When 
comparing speeches of past 
presidents, they found that 
George W. Bush had the low-
est grammatical level, with 
a 5th-grade average, and 
Abraham Lincoln the high-
est, who ranked far above 
a 10th grade level. Among 
the candidates, grade-level 
speech patterns are between 
sixth and seventh grade, ex-
cept for Trump. From their 
analysis paper, readability 
of a document is de?ned as 
the reading level, from 
grade one to grade 12. 
“[A candidate’s grade 
level] is determined by look-
ing at the lexical contents 
and the grammatical struc-
ture of the sentences in a 
document,” Eskenazi said 
in a Language Technologies 
Institute press release. “It 
is based on the observation 
that some words (and gram-
matical structures) appear 
with greater frequency at 
one grade level than anoth-
er. For example, we would 
expect that we could see the 
word ‘win’ fairly frequently

Currently, research-
ers’ understanding of 
cell communication 
has been limited to two 
dimensions due to the 
fact that the electrical 
activity of cultured cells 
has only been done in a 
two-dimensional dish. 
However, one research-
er at Carnegie Mellon 
has recently won a Na-
tional Science Founda-
tion (NSF) award for 
trying to kick things off 
the surface. Tzahi Co-
hen-Karni, an assistant 
professor of biomedi-
cal engineering and 
materials science and 
engineering at Carnegie 
Mellon, is researching 
how cells communicate 
through electrical ac-
tivity in three dimen-
sions through the use 
of nanosensors. Cohen-
Karni recently received 
an NSF CAREER Award 
entitled “3-D Nanosen-
sors Array for Eluci-
dating the Electrical 
Activity of Induced Plu-
ripotent Stem Cells De-
rived Cardiomyocytes” 
for his research.
“We are not two-
dimensional,” Cohen-
Karni said in an inter-
view with The Tartan. 
“Our excitable media 
is the brain: three-
dimensions, essentially. 
So if we wanted to know 
how cells talk to each 
other, the most straight-
forward way is to look 
into three dimensions. 
There’s a bunch of pro-
fessors around biomedi-
cal engineering that 
work on 3-D constructs, 
but now we’re trying to 
fuse sensors in with it.”
Instead of working 
with two-dimensional 
petri dishes, Cohen-
Karni’s method works 
with microtissues. 
Speci?cally, he works 
with induced pluripo-
tent cells, or stem cells 
which are capable of 
differentiating into 
many other types. These 
cells were derived from 
muscle cells from heart 
tissue (iPS-CM), with 
sensors to monitor 
electrophysiology. 
“We are trying to 
create microtissues and 
then capture these in-
side three-dimensional 
assembly of sensors. 
The sensors themselves 
will be assembled in 
space in three dimen-
sions,” Cohen-Karni 
said.
In order to surround 
the microtissue, the 
sensors are attached to 
a strip of polymer on 
a chip lined with thin 
strips of metal, which 
serve as leads and lift 
the polymer from the 
chip’s surface, where 
the sensors can then 
take measurements 
from all sides.
In the last 30–40 
years, sensing units 
were usually laid onto 
a surface. For example, 
the Michigan probe, a 
needle-like probe that 
measures neural activ-
ity directly from the 
brain, has many points 
of detection, but still lies 
on a plane. “We’re try-
ing to kick stuff off the 
surface,” Cohen-Karni 
said. “We’ll have an 
arrangement of sensing 
units in a barrel shape 
with x, y, z coordinates.”
All the materials 
used to create the mi-
crotissue and sensors 
are synthesized in Co-
hen-Karni’s lab at the 
Pittsburgh Technology 
Council. 
They synthesize 
nanowires and semi-
conductors that are sil-
icon-based materials a 
thousand times smaller 
than a human hair and 
fabricate ?eld effect 
transistors out of them. 
The lab also uses gra-
phene, a single layer of 
hexagonally arranged

Computer-generated imaging creates entire new worlds
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
If you’ve seen the trailer for 
The Jungle Book, the latest rei-
magining of the classic book, 
set to be released on April 15, 
I suggest you watch it again. 
Keep in mind that the movie 
was created with just one ac-
tor in an empty room. The rest 
of the movie was ?lled in by 
Computer Generated Imag-
ery (CGI). Consider any other 
animated or partially animated 
movie, like The Incredibles, 
Jurassic World, or Avatar. All 
were created using CGI. While 
movies are a common example 
of this technology put to work, 
the applications of CGI are var-
ied. Video games, virtual real-
ity programs, theme parks, and 
even research ventures utilize 
CGI to display things that can’t 
be visualized otherwise. 
This article will focus on 
three dimensional CGI anima-
tion from a cinematic perspec-
tive. CGI is an umbrella term 
that is used to refer to any im-
age created using computer 
software. One can create both 
2-D and 3-D images using this 
technology. The major differ-
ence between the two is that 
3-D CGI is used to create an en-
tire world, system, or anima-
tion, whereas 2-D CGI works 
with image manipulation, of-
ten overlaying one image with 
others. 2-D CGI often involves 
creating several renderings or 
frame generations of a partic-
ular scene or object and then 
modifying them further to ?t 
the expected outcome. Maya, 
SOCK, Blender, and Lightwave 
are some examples of software 
that can be used to produce 
CGI. Most commercial CGI 
?lms use a similar process to 
movies without CGI: For any 
movie, the ?rst task is to script 
it. Without having a clear idea 
of where story is going to go, 
or what the characters are 
supposed to do, the movie may 
turn into a bizarre, incoherent 
melting pot full of plot holes. 
After the script is written, the 
animator creates the “story-
boards,” which are basically 
several simple renderings 
of the same scene to get an 
idea of what works and what 
doesn’t. These storyboards 
progress into a formal layout, 
wherein the entire movie is 
“completed.” At this stage, 
none of the characters have 
features, mouths or faces. 
Their outlines and move-
ments are the only data that 
exist at this stage in the pro-
cess. Sometimes, this is also 
when the “voicing over” 
takes place. This sequential 
arrangement of the chosen 
scenes from the storyboard 
can be referred to as the “lay-
out.” It is just the rough draft 
of the entire movie. Layout is 
also done because it is much 
easier to make changes when 
the piece is un?nished rather 
than later, when one would 
have to work excessively on 
the details of the scene that 
has to be modi?ed. After the 
layout has been approved by 
the directors and other par-
ties involved in the animation, 
the details are ?lled in. The 
characters are given physical 
features, hair, and other so-
phisticated appendages. Hair 
animation is often left for the 
end because it is the hardest 
and most nuanced bit to actu-
ally animate. This is also when 
the lighting of the scenes is 
adjusted; the characters and 
objects are given shadows, 
illumination, and the like. 
From a production point of 
view, that is how animation 
takes place. From a slightly 
more technical perspective, 
the animation process in-
volves a lot more work than 
one might think. Most motion 
animation requires some kind 
of data about how an object 
moves. This data can be ob-
tained using several different 
kind of models, one of which 
is called the articulate model. 
This model is a type of skeletal 
system that de?nes the joints 
where motion is possible and 
in what directions. It deter-
mines what movements can be 
made and limits them to cer-
tain points of articulation, just 
like in a regular skeleton. 
Another model for col-
lecting movement data is the 
deformable object, which is 
often used to animate things 
that don’t have clear joints. 
These include clothes, water, 
and hair. Usually, animation 
involves using a hybrid model 
that combines several kinds of 
models together. Flip-books 
are representative of the meth-
od of keyframing to generate 
motion. As the name suggests, 
keyframing involves de?ning 
the frames at several instances 
in time and contracting them 
into one ?lm. Another meth-
od, usually associated with 
CGI is to use motion-capture. 
This involves ?tting live actors 
with certain special equip-
ment, which relays movement 
data to computers to be ren-
dered and animated on the big 
screen.
Movie-making is an intense 
process, and recognizing this 
process and all of the hard work 
that goes into it can enhance a 
movie-watching experience.

“It’s a multi-layer of com-

working on the apparatus to 
measure these units.” Gradu-

CAREER Award comes with 
a grant of $500,000 that will 
be used to further develop 
3-D nanosensors array for 
elucidating the electrical ac-
tivity of induced pluripotent 
stem cells, derived cardio-
myocytes. “It’s instrumen-
tal, I have to admit,” Cohen-
Karni said. “It’s not about the 
?nance itself. 
The biggest thing is that the 
NSF basically acknowledged 
that this is something impor-
tant that researchers have to 
work on. 
And of course, the ?nancial 
support is very important but 
I think the acknowledgement 
of the research and the out-
reach plan of the proposal 
got their attention more than 
anything. It’s recognition 
that we here at CMU do in-
teresting stuff.” In the future, 
Cohen-Karni hopes to expand 
this research to look at dis-
eased brain and cardiac cells, 
where they can branch out 
to investigate different dis-
eases and potentially do drug 
screenings based on the elec-
trophysiology of the diseased 
cells. “We are developing a 
platform,” Cohen-Karni said. 
“I’m not focused on single 
tissues. For now, let’s get the 
basic science, basic interfaces 
done and down the road we’ll 
start digging into disease 
related electrophysiology. 
Some of it can be really wild, 
even creating cyborgs.”
“Essentially, you take 
from each experience what 
you need to bring the grand 
idea to reality. Sometimes 
it’s not a linear combination, 
sometimes it’s synergetic.”

ROB MACEDO
Special to The Tartan
This week at Pugwash 
we discussed the “Right to 
Be Forgotten” — the con-
cept that one can request to 
have personal information 
removed from the online 
public domain. We began 
our discussion by sharing our 
knowledge on what that right 
currently means. One mem-
ber explained how at present, 
the European Union can force 
Google to take down certain 
search results. However, this 
takedown pertains, by law, 
to search results displayed on 
Google internationally and 
not only in the information’s 
country of origin. 
For example, say someone 
in Spain commits a crime and 
information about this inci-
dent appears online. If the 
European Union decides that 
this information should be re-
moved, Google must remove 
the results not only in the 
Spanish version of Google, 
but also in all international 
versions of Google. 
These comments lead us 
to the ethical question of the 
meeting: Is the right to be for-
gotten truly a human right, 
or is it an excuse for govern-
ments to exert censorship 
power on international pri-
vate corporations?
One member explained 
how this “right” needs to be 
monitored very carefully so 
that governments do not use 
it as a tool to remove incrimi-
nating information about 
of?cials, thereby leading us 
closer to an Orwellian society 
where those with power can 
wipe information away from 
history that they do not like. 
And, as someone else 
pointed out, the ability to take 
down certain information has 
been abused before: Digital 
Millennium Copyright Act 
takedown — when content 
is removed due to copyright 
infringement — has certainly 
been abused to remove unde-
sirable, yet legal, information. 
Yet someone else turned the 
conversation away from to-
talitarian fear by explaining 
how Google has not removed 
most requests, and as of yet 
has not been penalized for 
refusing to do so. Requests to 
remove search results relating 
to crimes committed or cor-
ruption seems to have been 
ignored by Google, while re-
quests to remove information 
about victims of abuse have 
been followed up. If the EU is 
indeed not abusing this pow-
er, and instead using it to pro-
tect abuse victims, why should 
we oppose their actions?
On the other hand, as an-
other speaker countered, the 
removal of information from 
the public domain is always 
taking us a step away from 
truth. Information can always 
be ignored; yet unknown in-
formation cannot be learnt. 
Even if information online 
is not true, by removing in-
formation we are still limiting 
our understanding of the cur-
rent state of people’s beliefs. 
And if the online information 
is in fact false, shouldn’t there 
be a ?ood of other online ar-
ticles that point this misinfor-
mation out? 
We then began to wonder 
what exactly the future of the 
“the right to be forgotten” is, 
regardless of the intrinsic mo-
rality of this law. Some mem-
bers thought that it was only 
a matter of time until this law 
will begin to take effect in the 
U.S. However, another person 
responded to this by suggest-
ing that the law follows from 
the more socialistic govern-
ments in the EU, and not vice-
versa. Thus, as long as the 
power of the American gov-
ernment over free expression 
remains checked, it is unlikely 
that we will see this law creep-
ing into the states. 
Finally, we wondered 
whether humans would learn 
to be more careful with their 
personal information in a digi-
tal age, thereby rendering this 
law unneeded. Some people 
thought this was likely, while 
others believed that careless-
ness about our privacy was 
part of our human nature. 
We ?nished our meeting 
with an uncertain viewpoint 
on this law, yet perhaps with 
a greater understanding of 
human politics, morality, and 
behavior.
The right to be forgotten creates ethical controversy
Ashley Chan/Staff Arist
Sense-making theory explains reason behind loss-aversion, echo-chamber
for the future. Once that task 
is done, you’ll most likely be 
more content with your life 
as a whole. This theory, that 
sense-making is a biological 
drive, can be extrapolated 
into many other areas as well. 
One such area is the theory of 
con?rmation bias, or the idea 
that people are “motivated to 
avoid information that chal-
lenges their existing beliefs.” 
This particular phenomenon 
is often represented in the 
types of media one consumes. 
If an individual happens to be 
a die-hard Republican, they 
will naturally tend to avoid 
left-leaning, liberal media out-
lets and seek out conservative 
ones, for example, because 
their  beliefs are in-line with 
those of the conventionally 
conservative media. If one is 
an orthodox Catholic, they 
will naturally avoid atheistic 
programming or viewpoints, 
in favor of ones which reaf?rm 
their beliefs. Con?rmation 
bias, Loewenstein asserts, is 
rooted at least in part in the 
drive for sense-making. Since 
we naturally feel worse when 
our lives make less sense — 
when things become compli-
cated — we often gravitate 
toward media or individuals 
which share our values. Were 
we to interact with opposing 
viewpoints, especially ones 
which go against our frame-
work for existence (i.e. “is 
there a God/an afterlife”), we 
would be somewhat forced 
to consider why we believe 
what we believe and possi-
bly to reevaluate our entire 
worldview. Loewenstein’s 
theory may go a long way to 
explaining boredom, as well. 
Since the pleasure we receive 
from sense-making is largely 
contingent on our expecta-
tions, we become bored when 
we expect to make sense but 
lack necessary information, or 
if the sense we do make is less 
important than we expected 
it to be. For example, normal 
people will often become 
bored when they stare at com-
plex math problems because 
they have no hope of making 
sense out of them. 
Additionally, if a scientist 
spends a long time working 
out a complex math problem 
and believes that it’s the key 
to furthering his research, but 
it ends up being a waste of 
time, he would feel a bit frus-
trated, and maybe even a little 
bored. On the ?ip side, Loew-
enstein asserts that we don’t 
get bored as we go to sleep 
because we don’t expect to get 
any meaning out of sleep, so 
the pleasure we receive from 
sense-making depends on our 
expectations and whether or 
not they match the outcomes. 
Loewenstein’s theory of 
sense-making has many impli-
cations, but in the simplest of 
terms, our brains enjoy mak-
ing sense of the world. Sense 
gives us security, and making 
sense makes us feel good, so 
we want to make as much of it 
as possible.
in third grade documents 
while the word ‘successful’ 
would be more frequent in, 
say, seventh grade docu-
ments. We would not see de-
pendent clauses very often 
at the second grade level, 
whereas they would be quite 
frequent at the seventh grade 
level.”
Researchers use a read-
ability model, REAP, for this 
analysis. This model uses lexi-
cal components (word choice) 
and grammatical construc-
tions (syntactical complexity) 
to measure a certain individ-
ual’s speech grade-level. The 
model is based on a database 
that contains sets of texts 
for each grade level. Texts 
mostly come from written as-
signments that teachers have 
published on their websites 
from students of each grade 
level. The model analyzes two 
aspects of readability: lexical 
and grammatical. 
The lexical reading dif?-
culty measure is based on the 
smoothed individual prob-
abilities of words occurring at 
each reading level. The gram-
mar reading dif?culty mea-
sure is based on typical gram-
matical constructions in the 
sentences of each grade level.
“Assessing the readabil-
ity of campaign speeches is 
a little tricky because most 
measures are geared to the 
written word, yet text is very 
different from the spoken 
word,” Eskenazi said. “When 
we speak, we usually use less 
structured language with 
shorter sentences. The read-
ability measure we use looks 
at how often words and gram-
matical structures occur at 
each level (Flesch-Kincaid 
looked at length of sentences 
and words). In this way, the 
measures we used are a bit 
more re?ective of any type of 
language, written or spoken.” 
One of the main issues was the 
tension between written lan-
guage grade-levels and those 
of spoken language, which 
tends to be more conversa-
tional, and thus less complex. 
In order to standardize, 
the researchers made adjust-
ments to re?ect language as 
a whole, incorporating both 
spoken and written language 
in their analyses.
Researchers also com-
puted the standard deviation 
of lexical and grammatical 
grade level for each candi-
date. The result reveals the 
degree to which the candi-
date changes their choice of 
words from one speech to an-
other. Researchers note that 
Hillary Clinton, for words, 
and Trump, for grammar, 
have the most variabile levels 
from one speech to another. 
This could indicate that 
they are the candidates who 
are trying the most to be well 
understood by their audience.  
Researchers are continuing 
to add more speeches to their 
database. “With more speech-
es and speeches of different 
candidates before the same 
audience, we may learn some-
thing more,” Eskenazi said.

If you’re anything like me, you 
give an involuntary contemptu-
ous little snort every time someone 
talks about neo-fascist revolution-
ary Donald Trump. Half a chuckle, 
half a sniff, this quick, sharp intake 
of air through the nose is the uni-
versal sign for “I can’t believe this 
clown is running for President — 
and winning.” If you’re anything like 
me, you thought Trump was a joke 
when he announced. Except the joke 
didn’t end in the summer like we all 
thought it would, or in the fall, or 
in the winter. Now, it’s spring, and 
Donald Trump is of?cially not funny 
anymore.
To be truthful, Trump never 
should have been funny in the ?rst 
place, and his impending Repub-
lican nomination is as much our 
fault for treating him like a joke, as 
it is the media’s fault for making a 
circus about him and Republicans’ 
fault for voting for him. It’s not funny 
when you call Mexicans rapists and 
criminals. It’s not funny when you 
demean women for their looks, or 
their menstrual cycles, or any other 
reason. It’s not funny when you lead 
a movement to question the Presi-
dent’s nationality because of the col-
or of his skin. It’s not funny when you 
lead a veritable lynch mob against a 
group of ?ve black boys accused of a 
heinous crime they didn’t commit. 
It’s not funny when you propose a 
ban on an entire religion.
But now Trump’s campaign has 
entered a new phase, something 
much scarier than even the racist, 
sexist, and xenophobic speech he has 
used in the past. And it really, really 
isn’t funny. Trump’s campaign has 
become violent, and that is a threat 
to democracy.
Since the beginning, there has 
been violence around the edges of 
Trump’s campaign. His rallies have 
always been rowdy, especially to-
wards protesters, and violent crimes 
have been committed in his name. 
But until March, Trump was largely 
able to wag his ?nger at the violence 
and distance himself. His fans were 
simply “passionate,” he insisted, but 
he would never incite violence.
Those days are long gone. On 
March 9, Trump’s campaign manager 
Corey Lewandowski was accused of 
assaulting Michelle Fields, a reporter 
for Breitbart. A few days later, a vi-
ral video surfaced of a Trump body-
guard violently slamming a photog-
rapher from Time to the ground by 
his neck. These attacks on reporters 
came just days after Trump proposed 
loosening libel laws so he could si-
lence the free press. On March 9, a 
Trump fan sucker-punched a protes-
tor, and a few days later Trump pub-
licly considered paying for the assail-
ant’s legal fees.
Trump frequently claims not to 
incite violence, but his words tell a 
very different story:
Feb. 1: “If you see somebody get-
ting ready to throw a tomato, knock 
the crap out of ‘em, would you? Seri-
ously. Okay? Just knock the hell — I 
promise you, I will pay for the legal 
fees. I promise. I promise.”
March 4: “Get him out. Try not to 
hurt him. If you do I’ll defend you in 
court.”
March 9: “See, in the good old 
days this didn’t used to happen, be-
cause they used to treat them very 
rough. We’ve become very weak.”
On March 16, Trump said that his 
fans would likely “riot in the streets” 
if the Republican party used a bro-
kered convention to rob him of the 
Republican nomination. This is ex-
actly why the violent climate he has 
inspired is such a serious problem. 
What makes the United States and 
other democracies both secure and 
reliable is that we direct our govern-
ment through civil processes, never 
through violence. While violent 
transitions of power are hallmarks of 
authoritarian governments and rev-
olutionary guards, the United States 
has astounding institutional credibil-
ity that precludes violence. Absent 
of violence, our political system has 
integrity, it is strong and trustwor-
thy. We might not always like our 
political leaders, but we can always 
trust in the power of the vote and of 
political action.
But when politics become vio-
lent, it is often the strongest, most 
brutal, most well-funded that win, 
and not the ones with the best ideas 
or a mandate from the people. By in-
stigating a violent political climate, 
Trump has threatened to undermine 
the stability and legitimacy of our 
democracy. By seeking to intimidate 
and silence reporters and protesters, 
Trump has made clear that he is a 
threat to political freedom.
Hate speech isn’t funny. But 
it’s hard not to laugh, even at the 
most heinous of words, when they 
come from an orange-tinted, out-
of-touch billionaire shouting outra-
geous things from the peanut gal-
lery. Months later, Trump has built 
a movement of passionate, angry 
followers who seem willing to act on 
any violent seed he plants in their 
minds. We simply cannot allow our-
selves to have a president whose path 
to the Oval Of?ce was paved, even 
slightly, by violence. That is the op-
posite of everything our Constitution 
stands for. It’s time to stop laughing. 
It’s time to start thinking long and 
hard about how stop Donald Trump.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
News media appeals to our need 
for certainty and factual information; 
satirical news often speaks to hard 
issues in an accessible and intrigu-
ing way, appealing not only to our 
need for facts, but also our emotions 
and sense of humor. ‘News comedy’ 
is the kind of term that seems like a 
complete paradox when someone 
?rst hears it. ‘News’ is seen as that 
old bastion of boredom where lan-
guage is used to recount facts about 
far off places and people that have no 
direct impact on our lives. Comedy 
is built around the idea of eliciting 
incredulous laughter by presenting 
seemingly unreal situations. By its 
very de?nition, comedy’s objective 
is to entertain as opposed to inform.
It twists the truth to suit a narrative 
purpose. And yet, in today’s America, 
these two ideas make for strangely 
compatible bedfellows. Some of the 
most watched shows today — like 
Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, 
the now concluded Daily Show with 
Jon Stewart, and the newer Daily 
Show with Trevor Noah — are built 
around this news comedy format. 
The assumption has always been 
that these shows are about entertain-
ment, and that their stars aren’t an-
chors so much as comedians. They 
can offer a humorous take on a con-
versation, but can they actually steer 
the conversation? Oliver, after six 
months of staying away from Donald 
Trump, dedicated an entire twenty 
minutes to lampooning Trump and 
his ludicrous policy positions in an 
episode of Last Week Tonight. The in-
teresting part is that for the ?rst time 
this campaign season, the attacks on 
Trump seemed to stick. One of the 
gags involved rebranding Donald 
Trump as Donald Drumpf, the origi-
nal last name of his German ances-
tors. To date, Last Week Tonight has 
sold more than 35,000 ‘Make Don-
ald Drumpf Again’ hats, and their 
‘Drump?nator’ Chrome extension 
has been downloaded more than 
433,000 times. In this case, Oliver 
didn’t just offer a take on the Trump 
conversation; he changed it. Out of 
everyone in the world, including rival 
political campaigners and ‘serious’ 
news anchors, the one person that 
was able to hit the Republican presi-
dential frontrunner was a comedian.
This anecdote makes for an inter-
esting commentary on the relation-
ship between modern media and 
society. When it comes to the news, 
we’ve come to trust guys like Oliver 
and Stewart, whose stated objective 
is to entertain, much more than tradi-
tional outlets whose stated objective 
is to inform. 
One of the biggest reasons is that 
these shows tend to be less stiff and 
self conscious, and thus offer more 
incisive coverage of the news. This 
might be in the pursuit of humor or 
it might be because they aren’t as 
obligated to appear unbiased as tra-
ditional broadcasts. Stewart, for ex-
ample, was always very open about 
the liberal bent of his show. By being 
open about his political leanings, no 
one could accuse him of favoritism 
when he eviscerated conservatives by 
asking tougher questions than most 
other television anchors could afford 
to. What’s more, if he ever went too 
far, he could laugh it all off as a joke. 
This format led to some hilarious and 
surprisingly illuminating interviews, 
such as one where he destroyed Jim 
Cramer for misrepresenting the col-
lapse of 2008, and another in which 
he gets Bill Kristol to back-pedal on 
nearly every outrageous thing he has 
said in his own publications. Using 
humor as the velvet around the dag-
ger, Stewart and his peers confront 
people head on to get to the facts be-
hind the ?ction.
Even more interesting though, 
is that these kinds of satirical news 
shows have actually been found to 
report the facts more thoroughly 
than traditional media. Ten years 
ago, when the satirical news idea 
was relatively nascent, surveys found 
that Daily Show viewers had higher 
knowledge levels of national and in-
ternational affairs than even readers 
of prestigious publications like The 
New York Times or The Wall Street 
Journal. Major media houses such as 
CNN and Fox News were much fur-
ther down the list. This implies that 
these satirical news shows, whose 
stated objective is to entertain as op-
posed to inform, are actually better 
even at informing the public than tra-
ditional media.
Finally, unique as it may seem, the 
use of satire to humanize the news 
isn’t without precedent in America. 
A hundred years ago, Mark Twain 
and Oscar Wilde entertained and in-
formed the American people by bra-
zenly poking fun at the government 
in ways that more mainstream media 
simply couldn’t afford to. Humor, 
just like it does now, sweetened the 
bitter facts and made them easier to 
swallow.
Where is news comedy going 
next? Who knows. Are Stewart or 
any of his contemporaries akin to a 
modern Twain? While it is a stretch 
to make that comparison, there is 
the fact that both of them have ?lled 
the same need for American society. 
We’ll probably be better equipped to 
answer that question a couple of de-
cades from now. In the meantime, sit 
back, relax, and with news comedy, 
enjoy the most entertaining and most 
informative source of news out there.
Perhaps one of the biggest cul-
tural observations that separates 
these two media genres is the idea 
of irreverence. News media can be 
too caught up in being fair and bal-
anced and honorable, and satirical 
news media has the exact opposite 
approach; comedians have the free-
dom to speak in colloquialisms, to ap-
peal to not only the facts but to our 
emotions as readers and as citizens. 
In this way, satirical news media is 
more rhetorically active than news 
media; while hard news largely ap-
peals to our sense of logic, satirical 
news can tackle dif?cult topics with-
out holding any punches, and they 
can utilize both factual information 
as well as emotional appeals to our 
sense of irony and humor. This makes 
satirical news less austere and more 
approachable.

Every day seems to bring a re-
newed discussion of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s feared stress culture and how it 
tears the souls from bright-eyed and 
bushy-tailed young students who 
come to the school ready to learn 
and leave thinking of school only 
as a competition for who can cause 
themselves the most pain. To be 
honest, that is probably an accurate 
depiction of what happens on this 
campus. That said, the direction the 
discussion often takes — intertwined 
with mental health initiatives — both 
does little to solve a problem and 
crowds out a different conversation 
that needs to be had on campus.
The best distillation of stress 
culture at Carnegie Mellon, in my 
opinion, is an excellent article from 
Dec. 3, 2012 by former online editor 
of The Tartan, Katie Chironis titled 
“The happy mask: Carnegie Mel-
lon must address stress culture.” It 
outlines the cultural underpinnings, 
origins, and effects of stress culture 
at Carnegie Mellon. I also think the 
initiative she pointed out — Mas-
sachusetts Institute of Technology’s 
MIT Together — is one of the most 
effective ways people have come up 
with at dealing with these sorts of 
problems. However, I personally feel 
she is wrong when she says the need 
for this is because counseling offered 
by Counseling and Psychological Ser-
vices (CaPS) is insuf?cient. That par-
ticular justi?cation is now the most 
prominent in discussions of stress 
culture here.
There is always talk of the need 
to expand mental health services in 
regards to stress culture because it 
concerns a lot of things we’ve been 
trained to associate with mental ill-
ness, like anxiety and suicide. How-
ever, this is a misleading connection 
that is not helpful to people who ex-
perience stress culture, nor to people 
who experience mental illness.
Clinical counselingas a treatment 
for someone who experiences stress 
in response to stressful situations 
merely pathologizes a normal reac-
tion. Chironis makes an important 
point when she says “Maybe it’s that 
every time we brag to each other 
about our workload, we’re cover-
ing up our fear with that same bra-
vado. On this campus, it’s normal to 
ignore your stress and pretend like 
you’re doing ?ne.” The problems 
with perceiving the people around 
you as happy while you are miserable 
are well documented. A University of 
Warwick study from 2011 found that 
when people feel as if they are strug-
gling in a sea of thriving people, their 
despair is magni?ed by comparison. 
This is a problem that is very 
explicitly not ?xed by counseling 
and other mental health initiatives. 
This is a social health epidemic and 
needs to be addressed as a cultural 
problem, not a lack of mental health 
resources.
Solutions would look a lot like the 
aforementioned MIT Together. Work-
ing toward a culture of empathy is an 
important step, as is trying to broad-
en the horizons of students beyond 
immediate life on campus. When 
people go to therapy as a primary 
solution, we’re stuck in a catch-22 of 
either risking students’ con?dential-
ity or putting students in a position 
where they still feel as if they are the 
lone zebra struggling to catch up to 
the pack as the lions close in.
The other side of this is problem-
atic as well. Discussion of mental ill-
ness on Carnegie Mellon’s campus is 
incredibly stunted. We consistently 
hear candidates for Student Govern-
ment and other faculty talk about 
expanding CaPS in response to 
stress. On the other hand, we rarely 
hear about depression and anxiety 
disorders in these discussions at all, 
despite both being on the rise among 
college students — particularly those 
who live far from home. CaPS is oc-
casionally completely overloaded, 
sometimes needing two weeks to 
get students in for appointments 
and, as I’ve mentioned previously, 
shipping chronically mentally ill stu-
dents off to “the community,” which 
is less than ideal. Students who deal 
with sexual assault and relationship 
violence and absolutely need pro-
fessional help are unable to access 
emergency care and, when they do, 
are caught in a system that is unable 
to meet their needs.
Carnegie Mellon has a better plan 
for dealing with Ebola, an outbreak 
that happened over an ocean away, 
than it does for common mental ill-
nesses. I once went to Health Servic-
es after a few sleepless nights caused 
me to pass out during an exam. I went 
home with a prescription of Zoloft for 
anxiety and Trazodone for insomnia. 
The Zoloft made me violently ill, the 
Trazodone did, uh, nothing, and both 
were prescribed after a single visit 
with no second thoughts. Medication 
is key to the process, but it has to be 
a process, not just a reaction. That’s 
not a good environment for healing.
It’s time for us to change the con-
versation on stress culture from a 
mental health dialogue to a cultural 
dialogue. Mental illnesses should not 
have to ?ght stress culture for oxygen 
and airtime and social health should 
not be trapped under the ill-?tting 
banner of mental health. It’s abso-
lutely terrifying that our collective 
consciousness as a campus thinks 
you need a therapist to tell you it’s 
okay to feel a little overwhelmed 
sometimes and that does not devalue 
you as a person. 
The fact that this comes at a cost 
to the safety of other students shows 
that our reaction to stress culture — 
to compartmentalize and patholo-
gize it — has become as toxic as the 
culture itself.

NFL throws weight around on political ?eld, combats inequality
JADE CROCKEM
Operations Manager
The National Football League 
(NFL) has been an integral part of 
American culture for a very long 
time. It creates divides among states 
and unites citizens in a way that 
not many other organizations can. 
Growing up in Texas, it was always 
very present in my home. Sunday 
plans at my dad’s house almost al-
ways revolved around what team 
was playing who and when. For most 
people, myself included, football 
creates a connection between fami-
lies. Moms, dads, and children alike 
put on jerseys and head to stadiums. 
It’s pretty safe to say that the NFL 
has a lot of weight in America, and 
you could probably sooner disband 
the United States government before 
you could disband the NFL. The NFL 
is not ignorant to the weight that its 
name carries, which is why I was 
excited to hear about the league 
deciding not to 
support states 
that choose 
to pass 
laws that 
are homo-
phobic, 
transpho-
bic, racist, 
or marginalizing in any way.
House Bill 757, a “religious lib-
erty” bill, was recently introduced to 
Georgia legislature and only needs 
a signature from Governor Nathan 
Deal before its anti-gay, discrimina-
tory policies can be enforced. This 
bill will not only allow certain in-
stitutions to deny marriages to gay 
couples, but it would allow faith-
based organizations to have the op-
tion of not hiring someone based 
on whether or not their sexual ori-
entation aligns with the organiza-
tion’s religious views. It wasn’t long 
before the NFL caught wind of this 
legislation and strongly hinted that 
Atlanta’s name will be taken out of 
consideration for hosting either the 
2019 or 2020 Super Bowl if the bill 
passes. This would come following a 
new renovation of the 
Falcons’ stadium 
that is already 
set to dig 
deeply into 
taxpayer money.
While no ?nal decisions have 
been made yet by either Deal or 
the NFL, this would not be the ?rst 
time that the NFL has had a major 
hand in state legislation. In 2014, 
Arizona governor Jan Brewer vetoed 
SB1062, a bill that is similar in na-
ture and language to Bill 757, after 
facing a lot of criticism from several 
large corporations, but most notably 
the NFL. Prior to the veto, the NFL 
released a statement saying “our 
policies emphasize tolerance and 
inclusiveness, and prohibit discrimi-
nation based on age, gender, race, 
religion, sexual orientation, or any 
other improper standard.” This put 
Phoenix at risk of losing the 2015 
Super Bowl as the NFL closely moni-
tored the progression of the bill. 
While there were also several other 
factors that contributed to the bill’s 
fate, it’s hard for a governor to turn 
a blind eye to the revenue that host-
ing a Super Bowl brings.
Similar conversations circled 
around my own hometown of Hous-
ton after the disappointing rejection 
of the Houston Equal Rights Ordi-
nance (HERO) bill. This bill would 
have made it illegal to discriminate 
against someone based on things 
such as race, gender, sexual ori-
entation, etc. Despite having such 
a large LGBTQ+ population and 
having a lesbian mayor at the time, 
smear campaigns that claimed this 
bill would make it possible for men 
to enter women’s bathrooms and a 
lack of young voter turnout led to 
the ultimate rejection of the bill. As 
of now, Houston is still set to host 
the 2017 Super Bowl, but the NFL 
has made it clear that they do not 
agree with the law’s rejection and 
will strive to make sure their fans 
feel welcomed at the game.
The NFL is taking a stand against 
cities that choose 
to discrimi-
nate. While 
it might 
not be the sole reason that these 
kinds of bills have been rejected, 
it de?nitely puts pressure on gov-
ernors to consider how the loss of 
the Super Bowl would impact their 
economies. While the NFL is not 
perfect and de?nitely has several 
internal problems, such as perpetu-
ating one single idea of masculin-
ity and not properly addressing how 
brain damage caused by football can 
lead to mental illness, they are try-
ing. They’re taking a stand against 
discrimination, which I think is very 
admirable. I love the NFL. I love that 
players wear pink during breast can-
cer awareness month, I love all the 
initiatives they have that allow in-
ner city kids to meet with and learn 
from current players, and I love that 
it is something we can participate in 
as a country no matter how differ-
ent we are. The NFL is using its 
power and its voice to take 
a stand and while some 
southern, conservative 
dads might not agree 
with the NFL’s stance, 
they’ll hopefully at 
least pay more atten-
tion to the problem if 
the NFL is talking 
about it.
The crazy mask: How Carnegie Mellon pathologized humanity
LETTER TO THE EDITOR: UNANSWERED QUESTIONS IN CMU ELECTIONS
This is my third student govern-
ment election.  This is also my third 
time being disappointed by candi-
dates.  Year after year, the candi-
dates say they will add new services, 
improve existing ones, and usher in 
a new age of prosperity.  Year after 
year, nothing changes.  This election 
presents a new phenomenon: igno-
rance of basic university services and 
working initiatives.
For example, one candidate has 
suggested a peer-to-peer mental 
health crisis hotline.  Doesn’t he 
know that CaPS has a 24/7 hotline?  
Another candidate suggested that 
someone from EMS should sit in UHS 
on weekends to help people decide 
if they need to go to the hospital. 
Doesn’t she realize that EMS oper-
ates 24/7?  Doesn’t she realize that 
student’s wouldn’t even have to walk 
to UHS, as EMS comes to them?  Fur-
thermore, rather than complaining 
about the medical insurance money 
wasted on water cups, doesn’t she 
know that the Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent health insurance fully covers 
all STI testing and birth control?  
Multiple candidates have expressed 
concern about the ranking of Carn-
egie Mellon, but don’t they realize 
that there is an army of faculty and 
administrators devoted to this?
I believe that all of these candi-
dates have good intentions.  In their 
own ways, they want to address what 
they believe are pressing issues for 
students.  My problem is not their 
goals but their approaches.  They 
are attempting to change processes 
in places where people are already 
working to improve services.  Adding 
a few students to initiatives that are 
already in progress within the uni-
versity will only impede progress, not 
accelerate it.  This is the premise of 
Brooks’ Law, a commonly cited phe-
nomenon in software engineering.
Most of our candidates seem to 
want to start unnecessary initiatives 
or interrupt existing ones.  Students 
deserve a candidate who is going to 
lead and motivate students to create 
solutions, not beg the university to do 
what it is already doing.  I encourage 
you all to vote with this in mind. My 
intention here was simply to question 
candidates in an open forum; I en-
courage candidates to respond, and 
invite voters to question those who 
would seek to lead them.
Connor Smith is a close friend of 
Aaron and Vaasavi and has close ties 
with their campaign staff. The views 
expressed here are solely Smith’s, and 
he does not work on the campaign in 
any meaningful way. The letter is a 
product of Smith’s own conclusions, 
beliefs, and opinions.

Budget lag leaves schools scarred 
SARAH BENDER
Junior Staffwriter
Public schools and colleges across 
Pennsylvania breathed a sigh of relief 
last week with the end of the impasse 
over the state’s budget ?nally in sight. 
However, there is no guarantee the 
storm has actually passed, and the 
Pennsylvania government should 
not have spent nine months play-
ing a game of chicken while schools 
went unfunded.
Despite lingering threats of yet 
another veto, Pennsylvania Governer 
Tom Wolf ultimately decided to let 
the newest Republican-proposed 
budget become law (albeit without 
his signature, as a sign of his contin-
ued disapproval). But what some are 
calling a victory in the Pennsylvania 
budget crisis has arrived nearly nine 
months late, and we can’t simply 
expect the underlying problems to 
go away because of a halfhearted 
compromise.
This budget does provide some 
bene?ts for education, a cause Wolf 
wants to champion during his time 
in of?ce. An extra $200 million will 
be distributed to various districts 
throughout the state. In addition, 
state-related universities like the Uni-
versity of Pittsburgh, Penn State Uni-
versity, and Temple University will 
bene?t from the bill — they are 
due to receive 5 percent more 
funding than they have in 
the past.
However, the very 
same schools Wolf 
claimed to want 
to help may have 
suffered the most 
during the months 
where the state had 
no budget at all. 
Districts resorted to 
borrowing money 
and cutting back 
on after-school 
programs and sup-
plies in an effort to 
make ends 
meet without much help from the 
state government. Furthermore, the 
state’s poorest public school districts, 
like Aliquippa in Beaver County, were 
in imminent danger of closing their 
doors altogether thanks to the lack of 
funds.
Wolf seems to feel that paying 
such a cost now is worth it for the 
greater good of the state in the long 
run. Concerned about the actions 
of lawmakers in Harrisburg, his ad-
ditional goals include preventing 
elected of?cials from receiving gifts, 
as well as supervising how campaign 
funds are used and how much outside 
income can be accepted.
“The consequences of that ?ght 
are starting to appear on the hori-
zon, and that is a short term shut-
down [of schools or human service 
agencies],” Wolf said in an article on 
PennLive. “But if that leads to a long-
term solution to this problem, that’s a 
good thing.”
In reality, however, the compro-
mise ultimately gave neither side 
what they wanted. Republicans, de-
spite their plan passing, were denied 
the liquor privatization, changes 
to the state pension system, and 
property tax reforms they tried to 
implement.
On the other side, even 
with an increase overall 
to education funding, 
Wolf was ultimately 
denied 
an extra $400 million for schools, as 
well as tax increases to decrease the 
state’s de?cit. He is still planning on 
vetoing the ?scal code meant to go 
with the budget, citing claims that 
some provisions for state programs 
are unconstitutional along with 
the fact that the plan would leave 
Pennsylvania in even more debt.
As a result of the lingering dis-
agreements, the budget crisis is not 
necessarily over. With the budget for 
next ?scal year due in July, there’s no 
guarantee that the gridlock will not 
simply begin all over again as Wolf 
strives to reform state spending, even 
at the expense of those who desper-
ately need any funds at all. During 
the nine months without a budget 
this year, Wolf was forced to release 
emergency funds to schools just to 
keep them a?oat. If the lack of fund-
ing continues, it is almost certain that 
the impact on struggling districts will 
be devastating.
While corruption in government 
of?ces and a growing de?cit are un-
deniably problems that must be dealt 
with, preventing students from learn-
ing gives rise to an entire new level 
of issues that permanently impact a 
generation of Pennsylvanians. And 
while Wolf’s endgame includes an in-
crease in funding to public education, 
threatening the survival of schools in 
the meantime is simply unacceptable. 
The viewpoints between the parties 
may be different, but it is 
now the lawmakers’ job 
to ?nd a way to resolve 
the issues in a way that 
is both legal and con-
scientious — not to 
mention timely.
One way or an-
other, lawmakers 
must ?nd a way to 
uphold the Constitu-
tion in the future — 
and they must do so 
without threatening 
the schools tasked 
with educating the 
children across the 
state.

In the endless cycle that is presi-
dential election news, we hear a lot 
about businessman Donald Trump 
and his promises for better deals. 
Deals with Mexico, China, you 
name it — Trump will make a deal 
with it. A great deal. You’ll see.
In the arena of current presi-
dential news however, the congres-
sional leaders of the GOP are faced 
with another deal that has a lasting 
effect on our nation, more than a 
four-year term. Obama has ap-
pointed a nominee to succeed Jus-
tice Antonin Scalia on the Supreme 
Court: Merrick Brian Garland. 
Obama announced his appoint-
ment last week in a clear statement 
to Congress: “I’ve done my job, now 
you do yours.” 
As per his constitutional duty, 
the president has appointed a jus-
tice to ?ll the vacancy, and the 
Senate will hold hearings and vote 
to con?rm the nominee, right? 
Wrong. Cue the stalling!
In their attempt to continually 
be the most unproductive Congress 
ever, GOP Senate leaders previ-
ously stated that they would not 
consider any nominees until after 
the election. “Give the American 
people a voice!” they cried. “Let the 
next President choose the Justice!” 
They invoke such “rules” as the 
“Thurmond rule” and “Biden rule,” 
which are both myths conjured by 
opponents of previous nominees. 
Many, like Senator Marco Rubio 
(R–FL) and Senator Ted Cruz (R–
TX), say that precedent mandates 
not nominating and con?rming 
justices in an election year. If you 
say it loud enough, it sounds true! 
Except for the fact that these claims 
are completely false. Pants on ?re. 
But let’s really dig into all 
the hypocrisies of their argu-
ment, shall we?
First, let us address all this pop-
ulist rhetoric. I get that GOP estab-
lishment incumbents are trying to 
sound like they want the people 
to choose. Let the people decide 
like our founding fathers intended. 
It’s a reasonable political ploy, es-
pecially when trying to save their 
seats with a fascist bag of Cheetos 
as the potential nominee. 
Except for that the people did 
choose; we chose Obama, twice. 
Now if some of the GOP wants to 
claim that the 2014 Midterm elec-
tions is a sample for the people, 
then they should tell that to the 66 
percent of our country that did not 
vote in them. 
It’s simple: the voters wanted a 
Democrat (as they have in the last 
?ve of six general elections) in the 
White House, so he will be appoint-
ing the judges until he’s out. No 
more discussion.
Now, don’t get me wrong, Demo-
crats are also at fault for holding up 
Supreme Court justices. In 2005, 
during Samuel Alito’s hearings 
to be on the Court, then Senator 
Obama (D–IL) and Senator Clin-
ton (D–NY) voted with 22 other 
prominent Democrats to ?libus-
ter the entire nomination process. 
Only four Democrats even voted for 
Alito to con?rm him. It has become 
increasingly dif?cult to keep the 
Supreme Court above politics, as it 
was intended. 
Still, in Alito’s case, the Demo-
crats saw him as a more extreme 
conservative ideologically, and 
would perhaps have been more 
willing to support a consensus 
nominee, a moderate that most of 
the Senate could get behind. 
Keep in mind many Republican 
leaders have called Merrick Gar-
land a “consensus nominee” (Orrin 
Hatch (R–UT), senior member of 
the Senate Judiciary Committee) 
in his previous hearings to be con-
?rmed to the D.C. District Court 
of Appeals, where he has served 
since 1997. But we’ll come back to 
Garland later.
Let’s move right along on to the 
so-called rules. For a party hell-bent 
on preserving the “original intent” 
of the constitution, it sure is ?ex-
ible on the de?nition of “rule.” The 
“Thurmond rule” contends that the 
Senate will not con?rm nominees 
to the judiciary after a certain point 
in an election year. 
Named after former Senator 
Strom Thurmond (R–SC), the rule 
originated in the 1968 ?ghts over 
Lyndon Johnson’s Supreme Court 
nominations, which Thurmond on. 
Since then, this partisan sugges-
tion has only been used when po-
litically advantageous to the party 
trying to block the nominee. And 
yes, both parties have used it since 
1968. But other than when the 
nominees were blocked in 1968, no 
one treats it as a rule. It is the Thur-
mond Myth.
The “Biden Rule” is named after 
then Senator and current Vice Pres-
ident Joe Biden (D–DE). This rule, 
as it is often called, actually is more 
of a suggestion taken from a speech 
that Biden gave as the Chairman of 
the Judiciary Committee in 1992. 
He called for no nominees to be 
considered until after the elec-
tion, during the lame-duck period 
before the next President takes of-
?ce. (Quick side note, Republicans. 
Stop calling Obama a lame-duck 
President. That’s not until after the 
election.) 
But still, Biden’s actual com-
ments are usually glossed over with 
no context. He gave this speech 
with no nominee to consider and 
no vacancy to ?ll. He had been con-
cerned with the growing partisan 
divide over judicial hearings, as 
Clarence Thomas’ divisive hearings 
had been in October of the previous 
year. 
Even so, the Senate never voted 
on his suggestion, and now the GOP 
is using it as a lame excuse to block 
the nominee while giving Biden 
some respect for maybe the ?rst 
time ever. Had enough yet? Good, 
me neither.
This brings me to the last Repub-
lican bastion of argument: prece-
dent. Justice Scalia spent his career 
as a direct interpreter of the Con-
stitution. He contributed a strong 
conservative voice to the Court for 
many years. Still, Republican lead-
ers tarnish his legacy by forging 
fake precedents to reject anything 
Obama suggests. 
As previously mentioned, Cruz 
and Rubio have proudly stated the 
“long tradition” of not nominat-
ing and con?rming justices in an 
election year. 
Those few words are the tricky 
part, though. See, the thing about 
precedent is, you need a real set of 
several instances from the past to 
back up that “long tradition.” There 
has really only been two instances 
in the past 80 years when this situ-
ation has even happened at all. In 
1940, when Franklin D. Roosevelt 
appointed Justice Frank Murphy 
and was con?rmed, and in 1968. 
That last one sound famil-
iar? It should, because it is when 
Thurmond refused to con?rm any 
Johnson nominee. This is the only 
instance that holds to that model 
because of the phrasing of their 
comments. Cruz speci?ed nomi-
nated and con?rmed, which dis-
quali?es those nominated before 
the election year but con?rmed 
during one, of which current Su-
preme Court Justice Anthony Ken-
nedy is one, who was nominated in 
1987, and con?rmed in 1988. There 
is no tradition of preventing nomi-
nees, only a hunger for preventing 
Obama any victory toward preserv-
ing his legacy.
Now, back to Garland. GOP 
leaders, the only people that will 
buy your arguments are the ones 
already voting for you, so why do 
you stall? Garland is for all intents 
and purposes left leaning, far more 
to the left of the center than Justice 
Kennedy is. 
Still, Obama has given you the 
most moderate candidate his party 
would allow. Many are still upset he 
did not appoint someone more lib-
eral. Garland leans conservative on 
criminal cases and has a mixed re-
cord on government transparency. 
On an even more basic level, he is is 
an older, white male. 
He is incredibly quali?ed to be 
on the Supreme Court. He clerked 
for Justice William Brennan in the 
1970s, served as a federal prosecu-
tor for the Oklahoma City bomb-
ings in 1992, and has served on the 
D.C. Court of Appeals since 1997, 
and as its Chief Justice since 2013.
What are your options? Let’s 
say you manage to delay until the 
next President takes of?ce. Clinton 
or Sanders gets elected, and nomi-
nates someone more liberal, with a 
newly gained Democratic Senate? 
Or, god-forbid, Trump gets elected, 
and he could nominate anyone. 
Maybe he’ll go Caligula on you and 
nominate his pet horse. Is that re-
ally what you’d prefer?
My point is, if the GOP really 
wants to improve its general elec-
tion chances, it needs to take this 
bargain deal now while it can; there 
won’t be one better. They should 
show the people they talk inces-
santly about that they can make a 
compromise. 
Stop the obstruction. Con?rm 
Garland.

Donald Trump is not a joke and 
I’m scared. Caveat: Regardless of 
who you support in this election, 
Democrat, Republican, Independent, 
it is very important to acknowledge 
that Trump is a threat.
Quite frankly, I normally wouldn’t 
even speak on this matter because the 
discourse on Trump is so prominent, 
but recently I’ve come in contact with 
multiple people — all kinds of people 
— people of color, women, and other 
marginalized people who support 
Donald Trump. This happens all the 
time, but honestly, it’s not funny any-
more. Supporting Trump as a joke or 
not as a joke. Is. Not. Amusing.
Recently, Brandon Stanton (from 
Humans of New York) posted a let-
ter to Donald Trump calling him out 
as a racist, and very validly shut him 
down; however, despite $67 million 
dollars being spent on anti-Trump 
campaigns, his poll numbers are 
higher than ever.
Trump is a real threat to our soci-
ety. And when I say this, I get a lot of 
reactions. I’d like to address some of 
the reactions I’ve gotten towards my 
fear:
“I’m gonna move to Canada!”:
Well, I am not. I can’t. Lots of peo-
ple can’t. I do not have the money to 
move myself from one country to an-
other spontaneously, and while this 
may be said facetiously, it’s literally 
delineating a situation that’s pretty 
bad. I am genuinely scared for my 
safety, as many other marginalized 
people are. I am scared for what kind 
of discourse Trump would spread 
as president, and who would get 
murdered. It’s happening already: 
there’s been a spike in hate crimes on 
Muslims (and other brown people — 
Sikh temples have been vandalized, 
holy books desecrated) in the U.S. 
since December 2015.
“At least it’s not Ted Cruz”: 
Who is spreading very violent and 
ridiculous discourse? Ted Cruz isn’t 
as outspoken and doesn’t receive as 
much coverage as Trump does, but 
he at least seems to have a cohesive 
vision for the nation that does not 
depend on rabble rousing. He him-
self, in fact, is a target of Trump, who 
decided to target his wife publicly on 
Twitter — where he basically called 
her ugly.
“But he’s just doing it to make a 
statement”: 
Donald Trump could be making 
the comments he makes to make a 
statement. He could actually not be-
lieve them. But the reality is he has 
spread an incredibly ill-informed dis-
course. As I said earlier, he has been 
very effective.
“Hillary vs. Bernie”: 
Don’t get me wrong — It’s im-
portant to have an opinion on who 
you’re voting for, but the fact is, 
when you have someone like Don-
ald Trump to address, why are we 
arguing on this? 
I’d rather spend my time convinc-
ing people not to vote for someone 
like Trump, as opposed to arguing 
whether or not Hillary is better than 
Bernie or vice-versa.
Other than the social issues, 
Trump really isn’t a successful man. 
He really isn’t. He’s had more failed 
businesses than successful ones, and 
he is $500 million dollars in debt.
So why do people vote for him? 
I don’t know. They say it’s because 
he’s funny, he’s outspoken, he’s a 
businessman, and he’s “truly Ameri-
can” — all great things to have in a 
comedian, but not in a president. 
There is a saying that there is no 
use in trying to understand a racist 
ideology like Trump’s. It isn’t based 
upon logic.

The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team faced 
off against the defending 
President’s Athletic Confer-
ence (PAC) champions West-
minster College on Monday. 
The Tartans dominated the 
Titans in a convincing 9–0 
victory.
The duo of senior Brooke 
Tsu and ?rst-year Marina Se-
lenica started the day with an 
8–0 win in second doubles. 
Junior Margaret Anne Smith 
and sophomore Katie Lai also 
won 8–0, scoring the second 
point for the Tartans in third 
doubles. Sophomore Cori 
Sidell and ?rst-year Minami 
Makino closed out doubles 
play, taking ?rst doubles 8–2 
to give the Tartans a comfort-
able 3–0 lead.
Tsu won her singles match 
without giving up a single 
game to give the Tartans 
a 4–0 lead, winning 6–0, 
6–0. Senior Abbey Hamstra 
scored the deciding point in 
sixth singles, winning 6–0, 
6–1. The Tartans ?nished up 
the competition without giv-
ing a single point up to their 
opponents.
The Tartans took the 
court at home on Saturday to 
face off against 13th-ranked 
Washington and Lee Univer-
sity. The 11th-ranked Tartans 
defended their position in the 
standings against the Gener-
als in a close set of matches 
that came down to the ?nal 
round of singles play. The 
Tartans were victorious with 
a score of 5–4.
Doubles began with the 
Generals coming out ahead, 
but the pair of Tsu and ?rst-
year Jamie Vizelman quickly 
answered with a point of 
their own in second doubles, 
winning the match 8–4. The 
Tartans then took control 
of the lead as the tandem of 
Hamstra and junior Nicholle 
Torres ?nished third doubles 
with a close 8–6 win to end 
doubles play.
Makino started off singles 
play by scoring a point for the 
Tartans in the ?fth position, 
winning 6–3, 6–4. This put 
the Tartans up 3–1, but ?rst, 
second, and sixth singles were 
all heading into a third set, 
and the Generals were ahead 
on the other two courts. 
Carnegie Mellon still had 
to put up a ?ght before they 
could take home the victory, 
but the Generals found wins 
in ?rst and third singles to tie 
the match at 3–3. 
However, Torres came in 
with a comeback win in sec-
ond singles to give the Tar-
tans another lead, winning 
2–6, 6–2, 7–5. 
The Generals quickly an-
swered and re-tied the match 
at 4–4 in sixth singles. Vizel-
man was the clutch player 
of the night though, and she 
took fourth singles in an in-
tense match by forcing a third 
set and winning a tiebreaker, 
4–6, 7–6 (7–5), 7–6 (7–5).
The Tartans are now 11–5 
in the season, and will next 
take on Washington College 
at home on Friday, April 1 at 
4 p.m to continue their run.

The lights dim in a stadium 
packed full of people. The 
crowd roars as the stage lights 
up. Is it a hockey game? A con-
cert? No, it’s the beginning of 
the 2016 League of Legends 
playoffs. League of Legends 
is a video game played by 
teams of 5 players that each 
control a character, known as 
a champion. These champi-
ons duke it out on a fantasy 
battle?eld known as Sum-
moner’s Rift, using magical 
abilities and attacks to defeat 
their opponents. Teams all 
over the world practice this 
game professionally, for mul-
tiple hours every day, in order 
to hone their skills. The best 
of these teams take to the Rift 
every weekend, facing off in a 
season-style format called the 
League Championship Series 
(LCS) to determine the best 
team over three months.
That three-month season 
has ?nally concluded for the 
spring, and the playoffs are 
about to begin. The best six 
teams from North America 
and Europe will compete in a 
tournament in their respective 
regions, ?ghting for the title of 
2016 Spring Split champion, 
as well as a chance to attend 
the word championships at 
the end of the year. The tour-
nament is a single elimination 
tournament, with each match 
consisting of a best of ?ve 
series.
In North America, the 
Spring Split has been domi-
nated by Team Immortals: a 
so-called “super team” made 
up of players from various suc-
cessful teams last season. Im-
mortals took the North Ameri-
can LCS by storm in the 2016 
season. Nobody was sure how 
this mixture of talented play-
ers would come together to 
work as a team, but they have 
shown themselves to be the 
best team in North America, 
and are even being considered 
as contenders on the interna-
tional stage. The Immortals 
navigated the nine–week reg-
ular season with just one loss 
in their 17–1 record; a nearly 
impossible feat according to 
recent seasons. They are the 
clear favorites to win the tour-
nament, and could perhaps be 
the team that ?nally makes 
North America proud on the 
international stage. Close be-
hind them is Counter Logic 
Gaming with a 13–5 record, 
and they are also the only team 
to beat the Immortals. Before 
the split, Counter Logic Gam-
ing lost their star carry player 
to rival Team SoloMid as well 
as their mid–laner to the Im-
mortals, so they had some re-
building to do. However, with 
the help of LCS veterans Dar-
shan and Aphromoo, Counter 
Logic Gaming has once again 
managed to ?nd their way 
into the playoffs. However, 
this time they’ve got a much 
tougher challenge on their 
hands than Team SoloMid, the 
usual classic playoff matchup. 
Counter Logic Gaming will 
have to get creative in order to 
beat the nearly invincible Im-
mortals one more time.
The European bracket is 
more complicated than its 
North American counterpart. 
The top European team is G2 
Esports with a 15–3 record. G2 
came out of the Challenger Se-
ries (the B-league for LCS) and 
took the league by storm this 
season, exceeding every ex-
pectation and proving them-
selves as the top contenders 
for the regional championship. 
However, they show more 
weaknesses than Immortals 
in North America. Their wins 
are less dominant and they’ve 
lost more games, but G2 plays 
with con?dence and fast, ag-
gressive decision making that 
results in very high risk, high 
reward play. If they can exe-
cute their plays with precision, 
G2’s hopes in the playoffs look 
very high. 
If they cannot, however, 
second seed H2k Gaming will 
be keen to take their spot. At 
14–4, H2k are just barely be-
hind G2, and they’ve been 
hungry for the chance to take 
the number one position. H2k 
is made up of well known, ex-
perienced players that have 
the ability to play as a team, 
and this is their advantage 
over G2. Being a fairly new 
team, G2 still has troubles 
with synergy and communi-
cation, especially considering 
problems with language barri-
ers between Korean and Euro-
pean players on the team. H2k 
should look to exploit these 
weaknesses with coordinated 
and precise team play. These 
two are not the only teams in 
serious contention, however, 
and teams like Vitality and 
Origen also have a very good 
chance of upsetting the top 
two seeds. They’ll have to take 
to the rift to ?nd out.
The playoffs begin with 
quarter?nals on April 2 at 12 
p.m. and 3 p.m. for Europe 
and North America respec-
tively, and can be viewed on 
YouTube.com, Twitch.tv, and 
Azubu.tv. Tune in and catch 
the action to ?nd out who will 
be named the champion of the 
2016 LCS Spring Split.

March is coming to an end, 
and late March means later 
March Madness. But what’s 
important about late March 
Madness? Well, it generally 
depends on your perspective.
Maybe you’ve gone 
through the drill. Every 
March, 68 teams battle for 
the NCAA DI Champion-
ship in a single elimination 
tournament. A huge number 
of people ?ll out brackets, 
where they try to guess all of 
the tournament results. No 
one successfully guesses the 
result, because there is a one 
in sextillion chance of doing 
that, and basketball games 
tend to be in?uenced by luck.
So where does that leave 
things as March wraps up? Is 
it over? Well, not quite. The 
?nal four teams, “The Final 
Four” in sport lingo, are still 
around. Two more games are 
left for this week, and one 
more game after will decide 
the national champion in 
early April.
At press time, Villanova 
and Oklahoma have locked 
up their spots in the Final 
Four, but two more spots need 
to be decided. North Carolina 
(UNC) has a showdown with 
Notre Dame, and Virginia 
(UVA) faces off with Syracuse 
for the last two slots. So that 
leaves the biggest question: 
what’s your stake in all of 
this? Let’s start at the top:
You’ll need some teams to 
root for, and there’s no easy 
choice, given that these are 
the best remaining teams in 
the country. So here are a few 
metrics to help you rank the 
teams, and help you with your 
decisions if you happen to be 
watching a game this week. If 
you’re simple and don’t know 
much about the game, color 
ranking may be for you.
There are two basic groups 
to the color rankings, the or-
ange hues and the blue hues. 
That leaves Notre Dame, with 
a not quite matching green 
and yellow uniform that 
leaves this category wanting.
If you’re more of a red/or-
ange fan, you’re going to want 
Syracuse ?rst. The slick or-
ange uniform is probably the 
only one of its kind left in the 
dance, and UVA’s blocky de-
sign sets it a little back here. 
Oklahoma’s ?at red leaves 
the most to be desired in the 
group, with a somewhat sim-
ple design.
On the other hand, if 
you’re a blue person, things 
seem to point in Villanova’s 
direction. UNC and Villanova 
might seem pretty similar if 
you’re looking at their white 
alternate uniforms, but as 
soon as you see that UNC 
baby blue, you’ll know what 
team is playing.
Just to keep things simple 
in case you aren’t sure wheth-
er you prefer blue or orange, 
I think a solid ordering would 
be Syracuse, Villanova, UVA, 
Notre Dame, Oklahoma, and 
?nally UNC.
Alternatively, maybe a sta-
tistical approach is more up 
a Carnegie Mellon student’s 
alley. Real rankings need to 
proportionally combine loca-
tion bias with actual statisti-
cal evidence. For this, there 
are probably two things that 
will come in handy. A scor-
ing index, ranking the teams 
based on their average margin 
of victory (because points win 
games), and a proximity in-
dex, which will rank the teams 
based on how close their cam-
puses are to Carnegie Mellon.
For scoring, we have Vil-
lanova on top with an average 
win of 13.9. UNC (13.1), UVA 
(11.4), Oklahoma (10.1), Syr-
acuse (5.5), and Notre Dame 
(5.1) follow. There seem to 
be two clear echelons, with 
four teams averaging a com-
fy ten point lead per game, 
for a lot of easy wins, where 
Syracuse and Notre Dame 
have lived a bit closer to the 
struggle. Distance data gives 
a very different ordering. In 
distance, we have UVA on 
top, only 184 miles away. We 
then have Villanova (244), 
Syracuse (267), UNC (329), 
Notre Dame (339), and far 
away Oklahoma (1018). The 
straight approach would be to 
combine the rankings, just by 
adding the places to get a ?nal 
ordering. 
If you like this idea, you’re 
left with Villanova as your 
top pick, followed by UVA, 
UNC, Syracuse, Oklahoma, 
and Notre Dame. But the un-
derdog approach is so much 
more exciting! In this ap-
proach distance will be mul-
tiplied by score differential to 
proportionally bias towards 
teams with closer proximity, 
and tighter score differentials. 
Lowest scores are the best. 
Final Ranks: Syracuse 1469, 
Notre Dame 1729, UVA 2098, 
Villanova 3392, UNC 4304, 
and last but not least Okla-
homa 10282.
So if you’re looking for a 
team to root for in the ?nal 
games of the NCAA tourna-
ment, there’s plenty of things 
to consider in choosing your 
favorite. Be sure to catch the 
madness over the next couple 
weeks, and see if your predic-
tions come true.

Academia Nut: weekly info nibbles
Staying on top of Carnegie Mellon was never this simple
So you’re a college kid. That means you balance 
homework, health, clubs, and a lot more. Here are 
a few life hacks that might be useful in reducing 
a bit of the stress that goes along with being a 
Carnegie Mellon student.
Does everyone steal your pens?
Take a blue refill, and put it in a red pen. No one 
steals a red pen!
Want to enjoy a cold soda, but it’s warm and 
you’re very impatient?
Wrap a wet paper towel around the bottle or can 
and put it in the fridge for 15 minutes. Enjoy your 
cold soda! (For you geeks out there, this works 
because of thermodynamics! Along with the effect 
of the fridge, the evaporating water takes away 
heat, cooling your drink quickly.)
Shop online a lot? Almost broke, but can’t 
keep yourself from adding just one more 
thing to your cart?
Download Honey! It’s a Google Chrome extension 
that looks for any and all coupons available for 
any website you shop at and tries them out 
automatically. It’s basically free money!
Date coming over and your room isn’t 
smelling pleasant?
Tape a few dryer sheets over your AC or fan to fill 
your room with a pleasing smell!
Want to clean up, but you don’t really have 
cleaning supplies? Love pizza?
A pizza box will work great as a dust pan! It just 
happens to be the perfect thickness and size to 
scoop up dust with. Put that box to good use 
before you throw it away!
Have a lot of jewelry, and keep losing it? 
Don’t know where to keep it all so you just 
throw it somewhere?
Ice cube trays make for great jewelry and knick-
knack organizers!
Like decorating your wall with classy framed 
posters, but also broke?
Use washi tape to make borders around pictures, 
making fancy impromptu frames!
Keep losing your remote?
Attach velcro to the back of the remote and the side 
of your couch and never lose your remote again.
Have a lot of beverages in your fridge but 
they don’t stay stacked?
Use binder clips to keep your bottles and cans 
where you want them to be!
Have a laptop that heats up a lot? Love 
working in bed with your laptop in your lap?
Use an egg carton as a cooling pad! The holes 
provide the air circulation your laptop needs!
Love making grilled cheeses, but don’t have 
a grill?
Turn your toaster horizontal to make sandwiches! 
Just remember to turn it back to it’s upright position 
once you’re done.
Love snacking while studying, but it’s making 
you gain weight?
Use your snacks as incentive for a task while 
studying! Not only will it limit your eating, but it will 
also help you reach your goals!

Advice for awkward people
Hi Josh!
I’ve got one of those 
problems that isn’t really 
a problem, but it’s like 
really hard and odd for 
me, so I just wanted to 
know what you think. 
So long story short, I 
met my soulmate. Like 
he’s an amazing artist-
type, plays the cello and 
knows his way around 
a camera, and he’s got 
some dainty chest hair 
going on, and he’s into 
literally everything I love. 
Like if God reached out 
to me and was like “Hey 
yo, list everything you 
want in a man, and I’ll 
make you one, specially 
for you,” and then I 
wrote down everything I 
want in a man, and God 
made him, it’d be this 
kid. 
So the problem isn’t 
that he’s perfect, the 
problem is that he 
doesn’t like me the 
same way. Like he isn’t 
straight. But I want 
him to be straight. And 
it’s a terrible situation 
because I want him to 
love me, but he doesn’t 
see me like that, and it’s 
kinda like being in the 
friend zone but worse 
because he’s not only 
not interested in me, 
but my entire sex. And 
it’s not even like I can 
just ignore him because 
I see him basically 
every day in one way or 
another. So like. What 
do?
Sincerely,
EVERYTHING’S HARD
Dear EH,
I’ve been there, and you’re 
right; it is a weird and 
slightly terrible situation to 
be in. Not only because 
you have these unrequited 
feelings, but because 
there’s a little bit of you 
that’s like “you’re not right 
the way you are, I’d rather 
you were this way, so I 
could be happier.” 
One of my biggest life 
philosophies is to not 
spend time worrying about 
things I can’t control, 
and other people fall very 
squarely into that category. 
I can’t tell you exactly what 
to do, because this sounds 
like a “you” problem, but 
I can say that changing 
your thought patterns is 
probably the best way to 
go. 
Or maybe you could 
blatantly ask him “yo man, 
you bi?” or point to a 
random girl as you’re both 
walking to class and subtly 
say “dayum, shawty,” 
and see if he joins in the 
muted cat-calling, as many 
straight men are wont to 
do. Or you could just ask 
him. Or you could just flee 
the country and live as a 
hermit in Nicaragua. The 
possibilities are endless.
Peace, love and puppy 
dog tails,
Joshua Brown.

Production at Purnell explores artistic con?ict
Bob and Dave and Ren juxtaposes mainstream and avant-garde notions of art
If there’s one important lesson I learned from the School 
of Drama’s premiere production of Bob and Dave and 
Ren, it’s that every debate can be resolved with a gay 
threesome.
All jokes aside, this show — despite its murky alphabet-
soup title — was a surprise treat. Bob and Dave and Ren 
is highbrow art talk disguised as all-male Dirty Dancing. 
Written and directed by Ben Ganksky, the show brings 
to life the polar philosophies of two artists who were both 
active from the 1960s to the 1980s. While installation 
artist Robert Irwin and influential pop art painter David 
Hockney never actually interacted, their ideas came 
into contact through biographies written by Lawrence 
Weschler.
These are the Bob, Dave, and Ren of the title, though 
their characterizations are based not on the details of 
their biographies, but on their ideas. Bob is a cerebral, 
pretentious artist who disdains traditional narratives 
and instead wants to create a unique “experience” for 
his audience. Dave, who is more mainstream, though no 
less pretentious, prioritizes accessible storytelling that 
connects with his audience. Ren’s solution of course 
seems obvious: Art can be both an experience and a 
source of connection.
Sweet and naïve Ren (played by junior drama major 
Petr Favazza) is a burgeoning playwright who decides 
to collaborate on a show with his old friend-but-maybe-
more Dave (played with vitality and conviction by junior 
drama major John Way) as producer and his summer 
lover Bob (junior drama major Dylan Bright) as director. 
This turns into a collaboration wrought with personal and 
professional tensions. Ren must mediate between Dave 
and Bob as they butt heads over their conflicting creative 
visions and their mutual romantic feelings toward Ren.
What takes the play’s concept from “kind of neat” to 
“super cool” is its three-act structure, which reflects the 
philosophies of its three title characters. The first act is all 
Dave, a traditional narrative with fleshed-out characters to 
connect with and a plot to follow. 
The second act, the work of Bob, is a bit more avant-
garde. With characters vanished and plot nonexistent, 
I put on color-coded headphones and obeyed a voice 
which told me to examine the theater walls and trace the 
octagon shape of the catwalk into my palm. One audience 
member — dubbed “the least lucky person in the room” 
— was instructed to read excerpts from the script for us 
all to hear. The other half of the audience was brought 
to an adjacent room, where I later learned they had been 
watching us from secret cameras. At times silly, relaxing, 
and unnerving, the second act forces the audience to 
confront the false reality that theater manufactures.
The third act follows Ren’s philosophy by attempting 
to blend narrative and experiential art. The actors take 
the stage once again to perform the culmination of all 
their rehearsals from the first act: an excruciatingly long, 
repetitive, and not very skilled dance routine. While not 
the most enjoyable to watch, this act was extremely 
interesting. It wasn’t a story, per se, but in my boredom I 
found myself applying a story to the men’s stray glances 
and increasing exhaustion. When even that got boring, I 
disengaged from what was happening on stage, looking 
instead at the theater and at the expressions of my fellow 
audience members. As the act intended, I became aware 
of this theatrical experience we were all sharing together.
I’ll admit that Bob and Dave and Ren is a niche show. 
Those who aren’t artists, or who don’t at least have a 
moderate interest in art, would likely find it impenetrable 
or just plain boring. Anybody uncomfortable with 
homosexuality would likely run to the door within the 
first ten minutes. The questions run the gambit: What 
is the purpose of art? How should a creator relate to 
their audience? Is my work original and real and good? 
Or maybe my critics — both external and internal — 
are right. Maybe I actually am full of shit. What I love 
about this show is that it taps into that nagging spark of 
uncertainty most artists never fully extinguish.
Even Bob can’t escape a little self-doubt. The explosive 
final confrontation between him and Dave showcased 
the acting chops of both men and featured sound-bites 
all-too-familiar to me from conversations with and about 
other artists, but I’ve never before seen it articulated 
on stage. Dave wrecks Bob. He calls him all talk and no 
substance, a failure of an artist who’s “not smarter” than 
everyone else — “just more arrogant.” Like any artist, Bob 
is sometimes inclined to agree with his critics, but what 
I took away from the exchange is that your self-doubt is 
often beside the point and sometimes you can only say 
“screw it all” and keep on creating anyway.
I haven’t seen Dirty Dancing, but I assume it also includes 
multiple steamy dance rehearsal scenes to songs like 
“I Had the Time of My Life.” This is not a laugh-out-
loud “romantic comedy,” despite what the description 
tries to sell it as. Its most campy moment comes in the 
“resolution” of Bob and Dave’s argument. I’ll reassert that 
I take no issue with gay threesomes, especially as this 
trio had fabulous chemistry and had been selling the UST 
(unresolved sexual tension) for the better part of an hour.
Bob and Dave and Ren wholly commits to its unusual 
concept; it succeeds in creating an engaging story and 
a memorable experience all in one. While confining all 
philosophical dialogue to the first act gives the play a 
top-heavy feel, the following two acts provide, through 
demonstration, enough food-for-thought that the sacrifice 
is worthwhile. At least among certain audiences, I foresee 
Bob and Dave and Ren living a long, happy life together.

Over the weekend, senior Iman Mazloum, a humanities 
and arts major in international and political science and 
directing, joined the chorus of voices that have been 
raising awareness about sexual assault and relationship 
violence in recent years. The production Mazloum adapted 
and directed, The Zahra Center, is designed to spark 
discussion about the reaction to sexual assault and abuse 
in Muslim communities.
What came through loud and clear in The Zahra Center is 
the tension surrounding discussions of sexual assault and 
relationship violence (SARV). As pointed out in the play 
and reiterated in the talkback after, the community can fall 
into the trap of victim blaming and treating sexual assault 
as juicy gossip. It can be difficult to discuss issues of 
SARV, but as Mazloum said during the talk back, “through 
art we can find our way, instead of it being an upfront 
conversation or a lecture at a mosque.” Mazloum’s art 
managed to navigate this complicated territory by cloaking 
the issue in humor.
When you decide to go to a play that “discusses the culture 
of silence surrounding domestic abuse and sexual assault 
in North American Muslim communities,” you don’t expect 
to spend most of the show laughing. But that’s exactly 
what happened. The show, which was an adaptation of 
Fatima A. Jaffer’s novel Surviving Zahra, follows the week 
leading up to bride-to-be Tahera’s wedding. Tahera, played 
by Alia Schindler, an administrator at Chatham University, 
attempts to set her best friend Masuma, played by senior 
computer science major Alaa Mohamed, up with her uncle 
Akber, played by Russell Hawkins, a sophomore electrical 
and computer engineering major. This, of course, leads to 
plenty of comical moments as the well-meaning bride and 
her matchmaking aunts gossip and plot. The highlight of 
the script was the banter between Schindler, Mohamed, 
and Hawkins when they sassed each other, their elders, 
and their society.
The conversation of SARV is introduced from two angles. 
Akber is the head of a support center for Muslim men 
and women who have experienced abuse or assault. The 
center works to help survivors find inspiration and support 
through their faith and the Quran. Masuma was a victim 
of rape when she was nineteen, and has a six-year-old 
child as a result. Their two stories run as an undercurrent 
in the play, bubbling up in charged monologues delivered 
straight to the audience. The monologues recounted the 
fear, self-loathing, and sense of isolation many women and 
specifically Muslim women experience in the aftermath of 
SARV.
While these monologues and the other comments on 
SARV worked into the play were true and important, they 
were not necessarily new to the viewing audience or 
the Carnegie Mellon community. We have been having 
campus discussions for several years now, and as Mazloum 
herself mentioned, the climate surrounding discussions 
of SARV has improved. It is an important message to get 
out to people who aren’t aware of SARV and the impact 
it has on thousands of lives a year, but the people who 
experienced The Zahra Center this weekend were, for the 
most part, not those people. They were people who were 
interested in the content the play was discussing, most 
likely because they were already engaged in the subject 
matter of abuse, assault, or Muslim communities.
However, Mazloum has some impressive plans for the 
play that would circumvent this problem. Already, she has 
started building the play into something that transcends 
its two-hour running time. The show included a table 
of resources, both on campus and around Pittsburgh, 
for victims of SARV. Mazloum also partnered with local 
Pittsburgh organizations such as the Pittsburgh Muslim 
Women’s Association, the Carnegie Mellon Office of Title 
IX Initiatives, and Pittsburgh Action Against Rape to form 
a panel discussion at the show’s talkback.
For me, the talk back was perhaps the most interesting 
part of the whole experience. Instead of focusing on 
the specifics of The Zahra Center as a work of drama, 
the panelists used it as a jumping off point for a larger 
discussion. Akber’s role as a man starting a survivor 
support network gave rise to a discussion about the role of 
men in working towards change how SARV is handled. In 
all of the discussions about supporting SARV survivors and 
creating larger change, the idea of listening and being an 
ally, not a savior, was reiterated time and time again. The 
discussion that expanded from the play was nuanced, and 
created a dialogue that was applicable to our community.
Mazloum has some exciting hopes for the play in the 
future. She is in discussion with the Office of Title IX 
Initiatives to get the play screened at Carnegie Mellon’s 
Qatar campus as, in Mazloum’s words, “a gateway to 
starting these conversations.” Beyond that, she hopes to 
offer it as an educational tool for mosques, Islamic schools, 
and Muslim communities that are grappling with these 
issues so they can use this piece of art to facilitate a tough 
discussion.
As a campus we have been engaging with the issue 
of sexual assault for several years, and while we still 
have a long way to go, the play’s focus on beginning a 
dialogue and building basic support is a well recognized 
message message for the most of us. But there are many 
communities that have not been forced to address these 
issues yet, and The Zahra Center offers a great place 
to start. It is wonderful to have a powerful, intelligent, 
and talented voice discussing issues of SARV, but it is 
exponentially better to have that voice heard by those who 
need it. Mazloum, with her charismatic speech and strong 
sense of direction, seems to know how to be heard.

For weeks and weeks, I’ve been heavily catering (pun 
intended) toward those who love to go out to eat and 
indulge, and I’ve been unforgivingly neglecting to 
acknowledge a very important part of the food loving 
world: the cooks. I’m not just talking about those who 
make homemade pasta from scratch and those who own 
more than ?ve different types of knives and know how 
to use all of them, but I’m also talking to the average 
college student who has more instant ramen in their 
cabinets than forks and who sometimes wakes up with the 
glorious ambition of whipping up some solid toast with a 
nice spread of peanut butter to top it off. There’s a clear 
contrast between the different sorts of homebodies who 
take preparing their food into their own hands, but I think 
the one thing that unites them — and the restaurant goers 
— all together, is a word that most college students know 
all too well: budget.
I’ve found, both from my own experience and from 
speaking to my peers, that one of the biggest problems 
that the average college student faces is feeding 
themselves well, and getting both enough to eat, and 
wholesome things to eat, on a college student’s budget. 
As an avid Buzzfeed user, I often come across list such as 
“25 foods that every college should master” and “30 foods 
you should learn to cook in your 30s,” which personally 
intrigue me, but also really make me consider what I as 
a college student ?nd most appealing and what would 
actually be feasible for me to make on an average weekday 
or maybe for a nice weekend dinner. So, what I’ve decided 
to do this week is recommend a recipe that I’ve found 
online (and tried myself) for my wonderful readers to take a 
crack at for themselves. I’ve gone ahead and picked a low 
budget, low effort, and sophisticated-looking recipe just 
for you, and I highly recommend you give this one a shot 
when you’ve got the time.
Chicken Parmesan: Unfortunately, it’s not as easy as just 
throwing some parmesan on some chicken, but if you’ve 
got an oven, the work you have to do is pretty minimal.
Serves: 2
Ingredients: 
- 2 frozen chicken breasts (thawed in advance) 
- ¾ cup ?our, 2 large eggs, 2 cups breadcrumbs
- about a 26 oz. jar’s worth of spaghetti sauce
- shredded mozzarella (8 oz. should be good) 
- ¾ cup grated parmesan
- salt and pepper to taste
- spaghetti (optional)
Materials:
- 2 shallow dishes (make sure you’ve got enough space to 
dip your chicken breast)
- a bowl
- wax paper and a 13” baking pan or a well-greased non-
stick 13” baking pan
- a pot (if you’re planning to make the spaghetti)
Prep: 
Preheat your oven to 375ºF. Make sure your chicken 
breasts are thawed and pound them so that they’re around 
an inch thick at most. If you’re using wax-paper while 
baking, lay it out on your baking pan ready to go. If you’re 
using a non-stick pan, grease it down with some butter, 
oil, or non-stick spray.
1) In the shallow dish, combine the ?our, ½ tsp salt and ¼ 
tsp pepper.
2) Break both of your eggs into a bowl along with 2 tbsp 
water and beat together.
3) Spread your breadcrumbs out evenly into the other 
shallow dish (tip: if you can’t ?nd breadcrumbs, you can 
make your own by drying out some bread slices in the 
oven at around 300ºF and then popping them into the 
food processor). This is a good place to mix in any other 
dry spices you might want to add to your dish such as 
oregano.
4) Lightly coat the chicken breast in the ?our by laying 
it down in the dish, ?ipping it over, and then shaking off 
the excess. From here, dip it into the egg mixture, and 
allow excess to drain, and then coat in breadcrumbs as 
you did with the ?our. Press on the breast gently in the 
breadcrumbs to make sure they stick. 
5) Place breast onto baking pan (on wax paper or non-
stick surface) and repeat with other breast. If you want to 
double coat the chicken with breadcrumbs, do so at this 
point.
6) Bake the chicken breasts in the oven for around 30 
minutes. (This is a good time to cook the spaghetti, while 
you’re waiting.)
7) Pour spaghetti sauce over each breast and sprinkle 
mozzarella and parmesan over the tops. Pop the tray back 
in the oven for another 10-15 minutes or until the chicken 
isn’t pink anymore. 
8) Take everything out and serve over the spaghetti.
Dif?culty level: 2/5
Till next time, I hope you enjoy giving this astonishingly 
simple rendition of a modern classic a go. Additionally, 
if you have any suggestions for restaurants you’d like 
reviewed or recipes you’d like featured, please send me an

Walking into WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU at The 
Frame gallery, I was ?rst struck by a large and impressive 
bouquet stationed in the center. Though not technically 
part of the show, the ?owers lend a simultaneously homey 
and austere ?rst impression of the space. The exhibition, 
which opened Friday, is the culmination of artistic 
exploration by masters student in studio art Gray Swartzel.
Sixteen months ago, Swartzel traveled to Manhattan to 
seek out a woman who would claim him as her child. To 
accomplish this, Swartzel put an ad in Craigslist, and, after 
?nding a number of potential candidates, chose a woman 
on a recommendation from a friend who had responded to 
his Craigslist ad. This led him to Veronica Vega, a Chilean 
woman. Their relationship is subsequently the focus of 
WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU, and includes pieces 
detailing their relationship in media ranging from video, to 
color photographs, to mystical multimedia pieces.
The most dominant piece in the main gallery space is 
Freudian Drama II, a large video projection that runs on an 
11-minute loop. The name is descriptive: the artist and his 
Chilean mother Veronica Vega sit in the back of a vehicle 
while discussing a variety of topics with over-the-top and 
soap opera-type dramatization. This gives the piece a 
very old-fashioned and intriguing air. Even if gallery goers 
do not commit to all 11 minutes of video, the soundtrack 
from the video, primarily emotional recounting about 
relationships, plays throughout the room as viewers can 
look at other pieces.
Two stunning and thought-provoking photographs 
capture visitors’ attention as they are located directly 
opposite the door. This piece is called Baptism Diptych 
(The Day We Met). In the photo on the left, a hand is 
shown, palm up — presumably Vega’s hand — with a 
drop of blood in the center, reminiscent of a Saint. Behind 
the hand is a crowded surface, ?lled with tchochkes, 
photos, and miscellaneous items, including the bottom 
half of an ornate cross. The photo on the right shows 
a man’s chest and torso with a red cross painted in 
the center. The religious imagery speaks volumes, and 
de?nitely lends a tone to the sort of spiritual contemplation 
at play in the exhibit.
In one corner of the gallery sat the piece Chest, a small 
chest of drawers that viewers are invited to look into. 
In the drawers are leather gloves, a fur mitten, and 
cyanotypes of Jesus. This piece is fun and gives an aura of 
authentic items that one may ?nd in a home. Perhaps my 
favorite piece was Cradle (His Through Her), which was 
a shiny crib that glowed in the darkness of The Frame’s 
back room. Inside the crib was velvet embroidered with 
two different designs, slightly intertwined. The soundtrack 
playing was of the artist and Vega, speaking and singing 
together. The audio piece, Something Stupid, made the 
whole exhibit seem more playful, as it seemed like a 
mother and son engaged in playful and humorous banter 
and singing. It reminded me of sing-alongs in the car with 
my family when I was growing up, only a lot weirder.
To me, the exhibit raised more questions than it 
answered. Who is this woman in Manhattan? Why did 
she want a child? What were Swartzel’s motives in going 
on this journey? I left the gallery feeling intrigued, yet 
impatient and confused. Swartzel’s work fascinates, and 
makes viewers question the nature of mother and child 
relationships. Rather than providing answers to questions 
of motherhood or family, each of Swartzel’s pieces 
demonstrate closeness between two people, and get 
viewers to think seriously about parenthood and what it 
means to be intrinsically linked to another human being.
Unfortunately, WELCOME TO MY FAITH IN YOU was just 
installed for the weekend, but Gray Swartzel’s work and 
information can be found at www.jgrayswartzel.com.

[ Kabir Mantha  |  Junior Staffwriter ]
According to John Carson, the Head of the School of Art, 
“the unpredictability of the MFA program at CMU is one 
of its strengths and joys.” This was certainly true of “Self-
Driving Car,” the Carnegie Mellon 2016 MFA (Master of 
Fine Arts) Thesis Exhibition. As the culmination of three 
years of study and experimentation, “Self-Driving Car” 
simultaneously shows us a snapshot of the artists’ long, 
arduous process while giving us a glimpse of their future 
trajectory. The diversity of themes tackled by these seven 
MFA seniors was superseded only by the diversity in the 
materials used to convey their ideas. From immigrant 
displacement to the history of technology, from french 
fries to bondage props, “Self-Driving Car” explores the 
entire gamut of the human experience.
The most visually engaging piece in the show was an 
installation by Tucker Marder, a graduate art major. 
Occupying the largest space in the gallery, Shark Shapes, 
a mixed media installation using foam shark toys, 
Bloodstream Top Predator Chum, nylon dock line, and 
?sh food was a treat for the eyes (but not so much for 
the nose) with its striking colors and quirky shapes. The 
piece consisted of many brightly colored and exuberantly 
shaped shark toys balanced on various platforms, 
pedestals, or, in one case, hung from the ceiling using a 
vivid red rope. There was one important detail: Each of 
the foam toys had been chewed by a shark, as evidenced 
by the teeth marks. On the wall were hung photos of the 
sharks mauling the toys, the frames covered in ?sh food.
Shark Shapes continues Marder’s exploration of what 
he considers “a more symbiotic relationship between 
humans and the planet,” through an “environmental ethic 
that promotes optimism and engagement rather than 
depression and paralysis.” The juxtaposition of these 
whimsical colors and shapes with an animal commonly 
used in pop culture as a symbol of mass terror brings 
out the inherent humor in our natural environment. 
Also, balancing the chewed up foam toys on buckets of 
shark bait, or, in one case, a giant globe of chum (hence 
the smell), brought home the delicate balance between 
human control over our environment and nature’s inherent 
responses. But ultimately, the appeal of this piece was the 
visual magnetism it exuded. The balance and precision 
with which the colors and shapes were positioned and 
lighted gave it a sweeping grace, a presence large enough 
to ?ll the entire space despite the relatively small size of its 
individual components.
Almost as striking was graduate art major Zhiwan 
Cheung’s sculptural and video installation The 
Impossibility of Home. As the name suggests, this piece, 
in the words of the artist, probes the idea of an “odyssey 
towards a home that does not exist, a rite of passage with 
no destination.” To represent this search with no end he 
chose banana trees and Chinatown orange. The former is 
a species whose history of dispersion and domestication 
is so complex that its origins are shrouded in a veil of 
mystery, while the latter is the name of a speci?c hue of 
orange that has no root in modern history. Chinatown 
orange also doesn’t have any root in the cultural landscape 
of chinatowns. Both of these combine to convey the 
artist’s search for a lost origin, an absent explanation.
The Impossibility of Home was a mini plantation of bright 
orange colored banana trees, Chinatown orange to be 
exact. No, there was nothing subtle in the execution of 
the concept. However, the orange trees and the dramatic 
lighting combined to form an immersive environment that 
was very enjoyable to experience. Also, the ridiculous, 
over the top aesthetic of the piece highlighted the 
ridiculousness of our mental associations of unrelated 
constructs as well as our inherent drive for answers and 
explanations that don’t exist. The piece sounds great, 
right? It was, until the videos started playing. The videos 
showed us clips of banana plantations and forests. Some 
had the fake orange banana trees in them juxtaposed 
with the natural surroundings. Some clips even had the 
artist wandering around a plantation in an orange onesie. 
The entire time, there was a narrator’s voice giving us 
the history of the banana as well as Chinatown orange in 
a tone obviously meant to evoke nostalgia, despite only

succeeding in evoking memories of Discovery Channel 
documentaries. This overt explanation of the “message” of 
the art removed all the nuance from the piece, making it 
seem like a parody of itself.
Right beside Cheung’s piece, the viewer is confronted by 
a barrage of color. In his Love Letters to Wendy, graduate 
art major Dan Allende explores the absolute depths of our 
food chain: junk food. Using the male belly, the essential 
characteristic of the “dad bod,” as his muse, he made 
plaster casts of his own belly, transforming them into 
vibrant masks. He then made six giant collages of all sorts 
of colorful household debris, Play-Doh, pipe cleaners, ?ower 
petals, and orange peel. In the center, fenced off by ropes of 
Cheetos strung together, were placed at various heights, a 
french fry suspended by string, and spinning at a different 
rate. The massive collages, the multitudinous masks, and 
the spinning french fries all combined to form a time travel 
device, shooting us back into those distant reaches of our 
childhood when indulgence wasn’t a sin punishable by 
contempt and our body wasn’t an item in a silent auction.
Probably the most traditional exhibit in the show are 
graduate art major Ada-Scarlett Hopper’s pieces Movement 
| Flow :: Bound | Free and Pas de Deux, dependency. 
Primarily a sculptor, Hopper uses the medium of 
photography to convey the idea of the body as sculpture. In 
Pas de Deux, dependency, using her experiences as both 
a ballet dancer and a dominatrix, Hopper explores the idea 
of systems of control that can exist between two people, 
and the ?ow of control from one to the other. Designed in 
a symmetrical manner, this piece is a stunning series of 
sixteen self portraits, eight with her ballet partner, eight 
with her BDSM partner. The photos all convey the sense of 
action and motion that is normally associated with these 
activities. By freezing them, we free ourselves from the 
notion of gesture, a concept inherent to the time dimension, 
and are able to consider the bodies as merely three 
dimensional sculptural objects. 
The self portraits are arranged in a line and halfway down 
the line we switch, almost imperceptibly, from one set of 
self portraits to the other. On all the photos, she has overlaid 
white tape to capture lines in the physical forms of their 
bodies, in particular lines that directly in?uence her freedom 
of movement. By doing so, Hopper has materialized the 
invisible matrix of control that surrounds and in?uences her, 
a matrix that she is, however, also able to in?uence.
“I like rules,” Hopper said on Thursday night at the open 
critique of her work, held in the gallery. That is something 
clearly visible in her work: sixteen self portraits on a black 
background, mounted on white, framed in black with 
white tape, all the same size, hung in a row, lit by a row 
of purple spotlights. We see an obsession with structure, 
boundaries, formal systems, control. “If we view bondage, 
domination, sadism, and masochism from a wide angle 
lens, it’s just bodies in space,” Hopper said. And this was 
very much the focus of the exhibit, the similarities between 
the seemingly disparate disciplines of ballet and BDSM, 
the same exchange in control, the same trust and the same 
juxtaposition between pleasure and pain, maybe even 
pleasure through pain. After all, “pointed shoes are foot 
bondage.”
Her self portrait triptych Movement | Flow :: Bound | Free, 
explores similar ideas of motion and control, this time using 
the “spotting technique” that helps a ballet dancer pirouette 
without getting dizzy. This technique requires the dancer 
to keep their head and neck stabilized in space, gazing 
at a particular spot in the audience before spinning, and 
turning their head at the last second. For the piece, Hopper 
tied a bondage collar around her neck, attaching the collar 
to opposing walls of the ballet studio. She then proceeded 
to pirouette as far as she could with her neck physically 
held in place, taking photos of herself in the process. In 
her own words, this was the “invisible bondage of dancers 
made visible.” Her work may be traditional in form, but it 
is inventive in content. Daring, yet not attention seeking. It 
is an unlikely but insightful fusion of a sculptor’s aesthetic 
with a photographer’s process. 
These were four of seven installations at the Miller Gallery. 
The exhibit will continue to be on display until April 10. A 
good night to visit the gallery will be Thursday, March 31 
when the works of Dan Allende, Tucker Marder, and Jesse 
Kauppila will undergo a critique open to the public. Eric 
Shiner, Executive Director of the Andy Warhol Museum, will 
be the guest critic. Other dates to mark in your calendars 
are March 31 and April 7 at noon when Dan Allende will be 
conducting a workshop on mask making and belly dancing.

Two and a half years. That is how long we’ve all waited for 
Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice. This weekend, we 
?nally got to see the manifestation of all that anticipation. 
I was well aware of the critical dark clouds being cast 
over the second installment in the DC Cinematic Universe 
before seeing the ?lm, but I needed to leave all those 
preconceived notions at the ticket counter, get my large 
popcorn and soda, and take my seat with an open mind. 
Can Zack Snyder deliver? How is Ben Af?eck as the new 
Bruce Wayne/Batman, or Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman? 
Have the stakes been raised since Man of Steel? I had 
too many questions and not enough answers. The lights 
turned dim and the music started. 150 minutes later, 
when the lights came on, I was not disappointed.
Following the battle that nearly destroyed Metropolis, 
the world must decide what is to come of a seemingly 
all-powerful alien from Krypton. While the Senate 
Congressional Superman Committee holds hearings in 
Washington, seasoned billionaire Bruce Wayne re-cowls 
as the vigilante Batman to destroy Superman and protect 
the planet — but there is a larger threat brewing in the 
city that will put these comic book gods to the test.
There is a lot to digest in this movie so let’s take it piece 
by piece. I’ll begin by moving past Superman quite 
quickly by saying this: no more, no less. Henry Cavill 
delivers a similar performance as Superman to the one 
we get in Man of Steel. In fact, this movie presents a 
more mature Superman, not in age but in attitude. Kal-el 
has experienced the con?icting feelings the human race 
has toward him, and Cavill does a ?ne job presenting 
Superman’s mental anguish over the issue. Nothing new 
or special from the Last Son of Krypton, but the Dark 
Knight presents some interesting surprises.
Let us not forget we have a new cinematic Batman played 
by the controversially casted Ben Af?eck. This iteration 
of Bruce Wayne is not a lengthy departure from what we 
are used to. He is a billionaire, tycoon, and philanthropist 
who cares about his city and is tortured by his past. 
Batman, on the other hand, is not the same Batman we 
are accustomed to. This Batman is old, retired, and angry. 
Superman’s battle with General Zod destroyed Metropolis 
and a Wayne Financial tower along with it, killing Bruce’s 
colleagues. “That’s how it starts. The fever. The rage. That 
turns good men… cruel,” said Alfred. Played impeccably 
by Jeremy Irons, Alfred delivers the line that de?nes 
why Bruce dons the cowl again and declares war on 
Superman. In his pursuit, Batman is a more brutal ?ghter 
than we have ever seen, most notably abandoning one of 
his core principles (No spoilers here, so I will let you ?ll in 
the blanks). This is my favorite iteration of any cinematic 
Batman. His more violent ?ghting style, his increased 
detective skills, and his snarky, as opposed to reclusive, 
attitude make this Bruce Wayne/Batman the most 
interesting we have ever seen. Granted the character 
does not experience much emotional range in this movie, 
Af?eck plays Bruce’s grit and resentment without ?aw.
Another hotly contested casting choice was Jesse 
Eisenberg’s Alexander “Lex” Luthor. The trailers shed 
some light on what looked to be a rather two-faced 
character, but after seeing the movie, Lex seems a bit 
more like the Joker. Lex’s role in the DC Cinematic 
Universe is much deeper than anticipated and this 
movie makes that clear. Instead of the dark, conniving, 
industrious billionaire we are used to seeing, this Lex 
Luthor is a paranoid, nervous, almost-afraid, dark, 
conniving, industrious billionaire. I did not mind 
Eisenberg’s performance and am not unhappy with the 
decisions made for the character.
Now let’s talk about Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman. I 
was optimistic. I trusted Warner Bros. must have seen 
something special in her audition for the character and 
she had been working hard to become a better actor. I do 
not know if all that is true, but Snyder used the character 
perfectly. Gadot is not required to do any highbrow 
acting, is not required to speak any long monologues, 
and is not given much dialogue with other actors. On 
the other hand, she is presented as a badass warrior who 
possesses extraordinary power, a deep history, and well-
founded morals. Additionally, Hans Zimmer and Junkie 
XL provide the music for the ?lm and Wonder Woman’s 
theme gave me chills up and down my arms. That is 
quality you cannot teach.
Last, but certainly not least, are the visuals. Zack Snyder’s 
?lms have always set the bar for having dynamic visuals, 
especially in battle. BvS does not disappoint. The ?ght(s) 
are beautiful to watch. The sound rumbles your chair. 
Batman has new gadgets. Wonder Woman is stronger 
than everyone except Superman. It is a pure thrill every 
time one character attacks another.
If all these things are so great, why is the movie getting 
such bad reviews? A very good question with a very 
simple answer: the writing and editing are sub-par. That 
is the foundation of a movie and what critics use to base 
their scores on Rotten Tomatoes. I can count on one hand 
the number of effective lines of dialogue in Batman v 
Superman. Throughout the movie, I found myself saying 
“Really? Come on. Really?” The script attempted to cover 
far too many bases making each important base less and 
less relevant. Unfortunately, the script is what a movie 
hinges on and is the difference between a good movie 
and a sloppy one. It is truly unfortunate and devastatingly 
disappointing to be taken out of a movie every time I feel 
like I have just started to connect. Never more so than for 
a movie that had such potential and years of anticipation.
Is Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice a great movie? 
By no means. Good movie? Maybe. Worth seeing at all? 
Absolutely. It will not please every viewer, but you will not 
leave the theater asking for your money back. Much like a 
few of the movie’s characters, audiences anticipated one 
?lm and got another. The resulting whiplash, combined 
with sloppy writing and technical strategies, make 
Batman v Superman an action packed slideshow of clues 
hinting at what is to come in the DC Cinematic Universe. 
Audiences’ high hopes for Batman v Superman: Dawn of 
Justice are not dashed, only postponed.
This movie is not a failure. It is an intermediary, a set-up, 
a sacri?ce ?y to right ?eld moving the runner to third 
so we can score on the next batter. Though I ?nd that a 
waste of a grand opportunity, I anticipate Justice League 
Part One will swing a big bat when it opens on Nov. 17, 
2017.

Batman V Superman soars on its spectacular visuals, but is let down by a disjointed script
Ben Affleck as Batman and Henry Cavill as Superman quite literally face off before battling each other.
