Lauren Groff offers her insight on writing 
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
Writer Lauren Groff 
spoke at Carnegie Music Hall 
as part of Pittsburgh Arts 
& Lectures’ Ten Evenings, 
sponsored by the University 
of Pittsburgh Press, on Feb. 
20.  Groff is The New York 
Times bestselling author 
of Fates and Furies, which 
Barack Obama declared was 
his favorite book of 2015. 
She is also the writer of The 
Monsters of Templeton, Arca-
dia, and the acclaimed short 
story collection Delicate 
Edible Birds.
Writers have to be 
readers, Groff said to begin 
her lecture. In her writing 
process for her novel Fates 
and Furies, she found herself 
returning again and again to 
works of art that she loves, 
beginning with Shakespeare. 
Groff delved deeper to learn 
more about the man himself, 
?nding little but ambiguity 
about his religious beliefs, 
his possible affairs, and his 
wife. Shakespeare lifted 
plots almost entirely from 
others, and in Groff’s words, 
he “took and took and took.” 
He was a “genius of synthe-
sis.” Groff quoted the great 
American writer Cormac 
McCarthy: “The ugly fact 
is books are made out of 
books.” She agreed, stat-
ing that Fates and Furies is 
also made out of many other 
books.
If Fates and Furies was 
to be summed up in one 
word, Groff states it would 
be marriage. For Groff, this 
idea came from her confus-
ing and contradictory views 
on marriage. She grew up 
in the feminist atmosphere 
of the 1990s, taking courses 
that diiscussed the sexism 
in the institution of mar-
riage. However, when her 
now-husband proposed to 
her, she said yes, because 
though she had made it per-
fectly clear that “marriage 
was repugnant to her, [it 
was] deeply important to 
him.” Groff has been mar-
ried for eleven years, with 
two children, and declared 
getting married was the best 
decision she ever made.
This hypocrisy — that she 
had bene?ted from an in-
stitution that she so deeply 
despised — in?uenced her 
writing. When Groff starts 
a new project, selecting the 
topic of the book is her most 
important decision. This is 
because she has to live with 
it for several years and wants 
to wake up thinking about it 
every day.
Marriage was something 
she could look at endlessly 
and never grow tired of. This 
topic was combined with 
another idea that came to 
her, the idea that she could 
never really know someone, 
not even her husband, that 
we, as human beings, cannot 
ever “crawl into someone 
else’s mind.”
Groff saw marriage as a 
mature love worth analyz-
ing. Marriage carries many 
of the ideas that are present 
in literature; power strug-
gles, class struggles, and 
time. “Novels are a sculpture 
of words and time,” she said.
Part of her writing pro-
cess is developing new pas-
sions. When writing Fates 
and Furies, the two passions 
began with no relation to 
her writing, but eventually 
developed and in?uenced 
important directions of her 
novel.
Groff’s ?rst passion was, 
of course, Shakespeare. A 
few of Shakespeare’s charac-
ters in?uenced the creation 
of characters in Fates and 
Furies. Falstaff from Henry 
IV, Part I, Part 2, The Merry 
Wives of Windsor, and Ham-
let were inspiration for Lotto, 
the husband in Fates and Fu-
ries. The wife, Mathilde, was 
inspired by Lady Macbeth.
Her second passion was 
Greek mythology. The title 
of the novel itself is a clear 
allusion to this. The Fates are 
three goddesses who spin 
the destinies of men, while 
the Furies are three god-
desses who take vengeance 
from men who swear false 
oaths. But the most vital fea-
ture of Greek mythology that 
she stole, Groff said, was 
the idea of time. In litera-
ture, time is often con?ned 
to the years of a character’s 
life, in human time. In Greek 
mythology, there is a three-
dimensional vision of time, 
the gods’ time. Groff incor-
porated this wider scope of 
time in her novel.
While Groff said there 
were many other in?uences 
for Fates and Furies, she de-
cided to switch the focus 
of her lecture by using the 
remaining time to speak 
about something very urgent 
to her: the importance of 
art itself.

On Feb. 23, Eugenia Cheng, 
an English mathematician and 
pianist, delivered a lecture at 
Carnegie Mellon titled “How 
to Bake Pi: Mathematics Made 
Tasty.”
Cheng has held several 
academic titles in her career, 
and is currently a Scientist in 
Residence at the School of the 
Art Institute of Chicago, and 
is also an Honorary Fellow of 
the University of Shef?eld and 
Honorary Visiting Fellow of 
City University, London. Her 
primary research topic is cat-
egory theory, a way to gener-
alize different mathematical 
ideas into different categories. 
She has written two books, 
How to Bake Pi (which the lec-
ture was based upon) and a 
more recent one called Beyond 
In?nity. She has also created 
a YouTube channel based on 
the mathematical topics she 
wants to introduce to a wider 
audience.
Cheng was introduced as 
someone who is known as “a 
rockstar in mathematics,” not 
just because of the research 
work she has done but also 
because of her passion for in-
troducing mathematics to a 
wider audience. This was her 
primary reason for writing her 
two books and the inspiration 
behind her YouTube channel 
— she has made it her mission 
in life to, as she put it: “re-
duce math-phobia around the 
world, and convince people 
who already love math to share 
that love to more people.” She 
aims to do this by using every-
day examples the general pub-
lic can relate to and revealing 
the math hiding behind them.
She credits her mother for 
her love of mathematics who 
she said introduced her to the 
logic and beauty of mathemat-
ics. While she was bored by 
high school math classes, she 
found in college that there 
was “something beautiful [in 
math] waiting for her,” just as 
her mother said.
She gave various examples 
of where math can be found 
where one might least expect 
it. This included having an au-
dience member juggle three 
balls while walking across the 
front of the room, which she 
said formed various sinusoidal 
waves if one took a time-lapse 
picture of the balls’ move-
ments. She said similar ideas 
can be applied in the shape of 
hair braids, brain cell tangling 
(which in a mutated form may 
signal Alzheimer’s disease), 
and the shapes of viruses. 
Even factors of an arbitrary 
number — 30, in her example 
— can be written in a tree-
diagram-like fashion, which 
then turned out to be cube-
shaped when she connected 
multiples and factors together.
One might, at ?rst glance, 
think that math and music 
have little to do with each 
other, but Cheng showed how 
it was possible to mathemati-
cally abstract out a represen-
tation of music as various en-
tangled waves. Cheng played 
a Bach piece for the audience 
while discussing this example 
of music.
Cheng related that during 
her career, she had seen many 
art students — to whom she 
taught math classes — go from 
thinking that they never need 
to do math again, to ?nding 
how math is actually present 
in so many of the different 
forms of artwork they were 
studying.
In her lecture, she put 
an emphasis on edible ex-
amples, because, as she said 
in the lecture, “whenever 
[she] mention[s] food stu-
dents perk up, not that they 
were all asleep before.” She 
even told a personal anecdote 
about how she once used Oreo 
cookies to explain conjugation 
theory. Her audience at that 
time surely remembered this 
association.
She spent a signi?cant 
part of her lecture using the 
Battenberg cake as a metaphor 
for mathematical patterns. 
In Battenberg cake, there is 
a checker-like pattern of two 
different colors in four squares 
and the two colors are not 
supposed to touch. Thus, the 
lower right and upper left cor-
ner are the same color, and the 
upper right and lower left are 
another color. She showed in 
her slideshow that if you make 
a table of multiplying one 
and negative one in different 
combinations, or adding even 
and odd numbers, or even 
multiplying real and imagi-
nary numbers  — these are 
mathematical examples that 
show a Battenberg cake-like 
pattern in their tables. There 
are even larger examples that 
make an expanded Battenberg 
cake pattern, which she called 
“iterated Battenberg cakes.”
Another edible example 
Cheng gave was custard, 
which she used as a meta-
phor for tree diagrams that 
can be both used to represent 
recipes and mathematical 
equations. While simple math-
ematical equations are often 
associative, recipes are not, 
as mixing ingredients in dif-
ferent orders can lead to very 
different results. Cheng said 
that this is re?ective of what 
many mathematicians study, 
which is how dramatically 
these equivalencies differ in 
non-associative situations.
Her conclusion from all 
of these seemingly ordi-
nary, everyday examples? 
“Abstraction is beautiful,” 
she said.

This Thursday, Feb. 23, 
the Global Communication 
Center (GCC) hosted a panel 
on publishing research in the 
STEM domain. Rangos Hall 
was ?lled as eager gradu-
ate students hoped to gain 
insight on the act of getting 
their research published in 
journals. Three panel speak-
ers offered their input and 
advice to young graduate 
students just beginning their 
journey into academia.
Members of the panel 
included Susan Finger, 
professor of civil and en-
vironmental engineering, 
associate dean for IDeATe, 
and founder and former co-
Editor-in-Chief of the jour-
nal Research in Engineering 
Design; Michael Domach, 
professor of chemical 
engineering and editor of the 
journal Biotechnology Prog-
ress; and Jonathan Cagan, 
George Tallman and Flor-
ence Barrett Ladd Professor 
for Mechanical Engineering, 
associate dean for Strategic 
Initiatives in the college of 
engineering, co-director of 
the Integrated Innovation 
Institute, co-director of the 
Swartz Center for Entre-
preneurship, recipient of a 
Courtesy Appointment in the 
School of Design, and associ-
ate editor for Design Science 
and Design Studies.
Students had the 
opportunity to send in their 
questions ahead of time. 
The ?rst question that the 
panelists responded to was 
how the process of publish-
ing worked. They advised 
students to use what they 
called “the smallest publish-
able unit.” This is the small-
est amount of research that 
is signi?cant enough to be 
published. In the surprisingly 
cutthroat environment of 
academia, waiting too long 
to publish your research can 
lead to a different researcher 
publishing the same work 
ahead of you.
They also warned the 
audience about a term known 
as “salami work.” Salami 
work is when a researcher 
splits their completed work 
into small sections and at-
tempts to publish them. This 
is different from the smallest 
publishable unit in terms of 
completeness. Salami works 
are small, individual parts of 
a ?nished research project, 
while the smallest publish-
able unit refers to small but 
complete research projects. 
The panelists also agreed 
that one thing you never 
want to do when attempting 
to publish is submit your

CMU Chemistry professor Yisong Guo receives CAREER award to study NHM-Fe Carnegie Mellon researchers make new discovery regarding synthetic nanoparticles
Chemists at Carnegie 
Mellon University have 
discovered that synthetic 
nanoparticles can be as 
structurally complex and 
accurate as biomolecules. 
This discovery has aided 
researchers in learning how 
nanoparticles form, which 
can then help them to even-
tually construct them. This 
can lead to the creation 
of new computer chips, 
materials, and drugs.
This discovery came 
from the lab of Carnegie 
Mellon chemistry professor 
Rongchao Jin. Jin has been 
attempting to create pre-
cise gold nanoparticles for 
years. He first established 
the structure of an ultra-
small Au25 nanocluster and 
has worked on progressively 
larger ones.
“Most people think that 
nanoparticles are simple 
things, because they are so 
small. But when we look at 
nanoparticles at the atomic 
level, we found that they are 
full of wonders,” Jin said in 
a university press release.
The researchers, led by 
graduate student Chenjie 
Zeng, established the 
structure of Au246, one of 
the largest and most com-
plex nanoparticles created 
by scientists to date and 
the largest gold nanopar-
ticle to have its struc-
ture determined by X-ray 
crystallography. 
The researchers also 
found that Au246 particles 
maximize the interactions 
between atoms and match 
symmetric surface patterns 
as they form. Similar to puz-
zle pieces coming together, 
matching shows that the 
components of the particle 
can recognize each other 
by their patterns and spon-
taneously assemble into the 
highly ordered structure of 
a nanoparticle.
In future studies, Jin 
hopes to push the crystal-
lization limits of nanopar-
ticles even farther to larger 
and larger particles. He also 
plans to explore the parti-
cles’ electronic and catalytic 
power.

Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet 
Writer of The Student 
Government. 
Election season has 
of?cially started at Carnegie 
Mellon! Over the past year, I 
have been able to see up close 
the amazing work that ex-
ecutive members of Student 
Government have accom-
plished — from work in ?scal 
and government transpar-
ency to the introduction of so 
many new and exciting stu-
dent organizations onto our 
campus. I’m de?nitely look-
ing forward to seeing what 
new ideas come in with a new 
executive board and Senate. 
But what spots are open, and 
what unique opportunities do 
each have access to?
Serving as the Vice 
President of Finance (SB-
VPF), Neal Choudhary (sb-
vpf@) supervises the Joint 
Funding Committee applica-
tions processing, managing 
over $1.5 million for student 
organization funding and 
monitoring its proper usage. 
Within this position, Choud-
hary has stated that the inter-
active nature of his role with 
so many organizations all 
over campus and the ability 
to help them make an impact 
is the most rewarding part of 
his role as SBVPF.
Nina Fan (sbvpo@) ?nds 
that the most meaning in 
her role of Vice President of 
Student Organizations (SB-
VPSO) comes from her ability 
to give back to the Carnegie 
Mellon community and help 
organizations achieve their 
goals. As SBVPSO, along with 
advocating for student orga-
nizations, Fan facilitates the 
process for new organizations 
seeking Student Government 
recognition and for the more 
than 350 organizations 
seeking re-recognition. She 
also works with the Of?ce of 
Student Activities to facilitate 
the biannual space allocation 
process.
In student government 
associations, the positions 
President for the Graduate 
Student Assembly and Un-
dergraduate Student Senate 
are held by Daniel Gingerich 
(gsa-president@) and Nikki 
Ambalo (student-senate@), 
respectively, and both are 
responsible for represent-
ing students and facilitating 
action and organization in 
their respective associations. 
Petitions are also available to 
students who wish to serve as 
representatives in the Senate, 
a position where current Col-
lege of Engineering Senator 
Dave Singh says he ?nds re-
ward in “being able to enact 
tangible change on campus 
for issues that truly matter to 
students.”
Finally, the roles of 
Student Body President and 
Vice President are held by 
Vaasavi Unnava (sbp@) and 
Aaron Gutierrez (sbvp@), 
respectively. These positions 
manage initiatives through 
the President’s Cabinet and 
head the executive board. Un-
nava says her favorite part of 
this position has been talking 
to students about why they 
love Carnegie Mellon. When 
asked what he found most re-
warding in this position, Guti-
errez replied, “you see the 
amazing things happening on 
our campus, and you get to 
help students do the amazing 
work they love.”
There’s so many oppor-
tunities to do engaging and 
impactful work as part of 
Student Government, so if 
interested, please reach out 
to any member of Student 
Government and form a 
petition before March 7!
Yisong Guo, an assistant 
professor of chemistry at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
recently received a Faculty 
Early Career Development 
Award from the National 
Science Foundation. This 
award comes with a five-
year grant which will al-
low Guo to study non-heme 
mononuclear iron-contain-
ing (NHM-Fe) enzymes. 
These newly discovered en-
zymes play a role in many 
processes which impact 
health and aging.
The NHM-Fe enzymes 
catalyze key steps in the 
biosynthesis of two second-
ary metabolites that are 
beneficial to human health. 
One enzyme, FtmOx1, 
produces a toxic chemical 
called verriculogen. Verric-
ulogen contains a unique 
functional group, endo-
peroxide, that displays a 
wide spectrum of abilities 
to combat bacteria and 
cancer.
The other enzymes, 
OvoA and EgtB, are involved 
in the biosynthesis of 
ovothiol and ergothioneine, 
molecules with possible an-
tioxidant and anti-aging 
properties. The grant will 
allow Guo to uncover the 
chemical principles that 
govern the function of all 
three enzymes and the pro-
duction of their secondary 
metabolites.
“Mastering the unique 
biological transformations 
demonstrated by these en-
zymes could further lead to 
the discovery of new bioac-
tive molecules that offer 
profound implications for 
human health,” Guo said in 
a university press release.
The grant will also allow 
Guo to provide training op-
portunities for students in 
physical chemistry, bioinor-
ganic chemistry, biochem-
istry, enzymology, and 
catalysis.
On Friday, Feb. 24, Carnegie Mellon University students gathered outside to enjoy a day of unusually warm weather. Students were seen lounging on The Cut playing music, reading novels, playing games, and doing work.

Panelists discuss the importance of doing impactful research 
In January, the 
government proposed budget 
cuts for the Corporation 
for Public Broadcasting, 
the National Endow-
ment for the Arts, and the 
National Endowment for the 
Humanities, all collectively a 
minuscule percent of the 
national budget. Groff 
claimed these cuts are not 
?scally conservative but 
politically motivated and 
partisan. They say that 
the arts don’t matter and 
essentially tell artists to “sit 
down and to shut up.”
“Art is utterly necessary,” 
Groff said, to large applause. 
“Art is culture. Culture is life.” 
She used the famous quote 
from William Carlos Williams’ 
poem “Asphodel, That Greeny 
Flower.” In the poem, he  
states “it is dif?cult to get the 
news from poems yet men 
die miserably every day for 
lack of what is found there.” 
Groff argued that this is often 
misquoted and leads to the 
misconception that Williams 
believes a man dies without 
poetry. What Williams is re-
ally saying is less lyrical but 
more true. Men do not die be-
cause of lack of poetry, but die 
miserably with lack of poetry. 
Groff explained that Williams 
is saying that the pursuit of 
poetry and the pursuit to art 
leads a man to a death that is 
not miserable because he has 
led a noble, happy life.
“Art can lead the way to 
resist. Art can teach you how 
to love. Art can keep you from 
despair. Art is always politi-
cal, and good art is always 
oppositional. Art can keep 
you alive. It feeds the soul,” 
Groff said. She concluded her 
lecture with a request to the 
audience: “Do everything you 
can do to keep art alive in this 
terrifying world of ours.” She 
asked us to ?ght for all artists, 
because in doing so, we are 
“?ghting for [ourselves] and 
for the bright and living soul 
of this country.”

Professor Andreas Pfenning seeks to discover cure for Alzheimer’s
ROSE PAGANO
Personnel Manager
Andreas Pfenning, an 
assistant professor for the 
Department of Computational 
Biology at Carnegie Mellon, 
recently joined a renowned re-
search team that is attempting 
to discover new ways to turn 
genetic ?ndings into possible 
new therapies for Alzheimer’s.
Founded in 2004, the 
Cure Alzheimer’s Fund is 
considered to be a nonpro?t 
organization determined to 
support research that has the 
best likelihood of stopping, 
decelerating, or reversing 
Alzheimer’s disease.
Pfenning is connected to 
BrainHub, Carnegie Mellon’s 
neuroscience initiative. Along 
with colleague Morgan Wirth-
lin, who is BrainHub’s post-
doctoral fellow, Pfenning has 
completed some preliminary 
work on this research.
Now that he is a member 
of the research team created 
by the Cure Alzheimer’s Fund, 
Pfenning plans on performing 
computational techniques as 
a way to possibly identify the 
genetic sequences that contain 
therapeutic potential for peo-
ple with Alzheimer’s. Pfenning 
is also creating biological tech-
niques to evaluate the func-
tion of human DNA fragments 
in mice brains.
“We are looking for those 
parts of the human genome 
that are active in the brain 
cells of Alzheimer’s patients,” 
Pfenning said in a university 
press release.
This project is a $4 million 
investment that will last two 
years and is referred to as the 
Collaboration to Infer Regu-
latory Circuits to Uncover In-
novative Therapeutic Strate-
gies (CIRCUITS). Along with 
Pfenning, researchers from 
Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, the Salk Institute 
for Biological Studies, Massa-
chusetts General Hospital, the 
University of Shef?eld, and 
the University of Luebeck will 
be joining CIRCUITS.
The scientists are optimistic 
about their ?ndings thus far 
and believe that they have lo-
cated around 20 to 30 genetic 
sequences grouped with this 
type of dementia. They also 
think that there are hundreds 
and possibly thousands of 
segments associated with this 
disease.
The process of recognizing 
and assessing this large 
amount of DNA sequences 
means that new analyses and 
methods to examine these 
large segments are neces-
sary, according to Pfenning. 
Pfenning also claims that it is 
imperative to construct new 
ways to analyze the DNA in 
the brains of mice.
“In the past this has been 
done one gene at a time and it 
has not been done in a system-
atic way,” Pfenning said. “My 
lab will be creating new tech-
niques that bridge analytics 
and experimentation.”
research to multiple journals 
at the same time. Not only 
will this be seen as rude, but 
it is likely that your work will 
end up being reviewed by the 
same person anyway before 
being published.
Another question that 
was raised was, “how do you 
become a reviewer?” Cagan 
laughed at this, saying, “well, 
you could do what I did: send 
an email and ask.” This seems 
almost laughably easy and 
simple, and all of the profes-
sors agreed that everyone in 
the audience was too young 
to truly consider it. Being 
a reviewer requires senior-
ity and a strong reputation, 
which can only be developed 
with time. The panelists re-
?ected on what they did as 
reviewers that they found 
effective, and decided upon 
the three main things that 
they considered.
Cagan stated that he ?rst 
questions why he should read 
this research. Without signi?-
cant impact, research is not 
useful and therefore not worth 
the process of reviewing and 
publishing. Another impact-
ful issue for them was that ev-
eryone whose name is on the 
paper was a participant in the 
research. Finally, they wanted 
every paper that they reviewed 
to have addressed whether 
there were any con?icts of in-
terest in their research.
Finger, Domach, and 
Cagan next talked about what 
made a strong, publishable 
article. They said that the two 
most important issues are the 
quality of one’s research and 
the quality of one’s writing. 
A good research article must 
have both of these attributes 
to be successful. A successful 
article will also address the 
proper audience. The panel-
ists have reviewed papers that 
either assumed that the read-
ers of their respective journals 
were all too familiar with a 
subject, which made the ar-
ticle far too technical, or con-
sidered the audience to know 
almost nothing about STEM, 
which led to the paper feeling 
almost insulting to the aver-
age reader. As in all things, the 
proper balance must be found.
The established panelists 
left the audience with a ?nal 
message: all of these pieces of 
advice vary from ?eld to ?eld 
and with personal experience. 
While knowledgeable through 
years of experience, each of 
them only knew what their 
experiences had taught them 
and believe the students in the 
audience might ?nd that their 
attempts at publishing could 
vary wildly.

Three-year college programs aren’t more economical
EMMETT ELDRED
Democrats made the ?rst impor-
tant decision about the future of 
their party since the 2016 election 
by selecting former Labor Secretary 
Tom Perez as their new chairman 
last Saturday, Feb. 25. It’s possible 
that all the hype surrounding the 
DNC Chair race was overblown. This 
is, after all, the Democratic Party’s 
version of a student council election. 
On the other hand, it’s a student 
council election whose top candi-
dates rose close to $1 million apiece 
in fundrasing. While the Democratic 
chair’s role is limited and the job de-
scription is much more about party 
mechanics than policy or messag-
ing, the election was played out in 
the media and within Democratic 
circles as a “?ght for the soul of the 
party,” pitting its “establishment” 
and progressive wings against one 
another.
Aside from Perez, the top can-
didate was Minnesota Rep. Keith 
Ellison, the ?rst Muslim-American 
elected to congress and a strident 
Bernie Sanders supporter during 
the Democratic presidential pri-
mary elections. Ellison was long 
the frontrunner for the DNC Chair, 
earning early endorsements from 
progressive icons like Senators 
Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth War-
ren, as well as endorsements from 
top establishment ?gures like Sen-
ate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer 
and former Senate majority leader 
Harry Reid. But Perez entered the 
race late, reportedly at the urging 
of former President Barack Obama, 
and quickly emerged as the new 
favorite because of his ties to the 
Democratic establishment, which 
controls much of the voting mem-
bership of the DNC.
Thus, the DNC chair race 
emerged as a proxy battle between 
establishment and progressive Dem-
ocrats, pitting the Bernie Sanders/
Elizabeth Warren wing of the party 
against its Barack Obama/Hillary 
Clinton wing. Just like during the 
primary elections a year before, the 
Democratic Party is divided over its 
vision of its own future. Essentially, 
progressives want sweeping change 
within the party going forward, 
with a new emphasis on grassroots 
organizing, local party-building, 
and a full-throated commitment to 
economic populism. By contrast, 
establishment Democrats acknowl-
edge the need for some reforms 
around the edges, but they insist 
that the party is already on the right 
track and just needs to do better 
with turnout in the future. Just like 
in the primaries, this election boiled 
down to change vs. status quo.
Both Perez and Ellison them-
selves were hesitant to embrace this 
narrative. Throughout their cam-
paigns, they both stressed the need 
for party unity and pledged to work 
closely with whoever was selected 
to be the new party chair. And both 
candidates could be seen as compro-
mise choices. Ellison was a die-hard 
Sanders supporter, but he backed 
Clinton every bit as enthusiastically 
during the general election, emerg-
ing as one of her key surrogates in 
the midwest. Meanwhile, Perez was 
arguably the most progressive mem-
ber of Obama’s cabinet. The DNC 
chair debates were almost laugh-
able for how much the candidates 
agreed with each other on just about 
everything.
Yet, Ellison and Perez empha-
sized different agendas for the 
DNC and disagreed over how to 
interpret the 2016 election results. 
Ellison spoke for the need not 
just of a “50-state party,” but for a 
“3007-County Party,” which invests 
signi?cant energy and resources 
into grassroots mobilization and re-
building the party from the ground 
up by competing for local and state 
of?ces. Perez, on the other hand, ar-
gued that the party’s organizing and 
infrastructure is ?ne, but that the 
key to winning elections going for-
ward is to turn out the votes through 
even more advanced data strategies 
and old-fashioned retail politics.
Ellison blamed Clinton’s loss 
on her weaknesses regarding Wall 
Street, trade, and other economic 
policies. Perez often pointed to 
outside in?uences like FBI Direc-
tor James Comey and Wikileaks 
for Clinton’s loss and argued that 
Clinton’s three-million-vote victory 
is evidence that the party is ?ne on 
policy and just needs to ?ne tune its 
organizing to turn out voters in key 
states.
However, Perez’s view of the 
state of the Democratic Party large-
ly ignores the fact that Democrats 
have lost hundreds of state and lo-
cal of?ces over the past eight years. 
By this measure, Democrats are at 
their weakest point in nearly a cen-
tury. The party is basically nonexis-
tent in much of the deep south and 
throughout rural America, and it 
struggles even to defend its promi-
nence in reliably progressive states 
and regions, and let’s not forget that 
Democrats lost a presidential elec-
tion to the most unquali?ed and 
objectionable candidate in modern 
American history. Simply put, the 
Democratic Party is in a dire state.
Yet by voting for Perez, the Dem-
ocratic Party has chosen to ignore its 
troubles and opted for more of the 
same. While Perez might be perfect-

again allowing the inertia of the status 
quo to overwhelm their party at the grass-
roots and within the progressive wing.

$70,094.
This is how much a senior in high 
school who received or will receive 
an acceptance letter from Carnegie 
Mellon will be paying for one year of 
education. According to a 2015 Cen-
sus, the median household income 
of an American family is $55,775; 
some students are paying 25 percent 
more than an average family earns in 
one year to be here. College is expen-
sive, and it’s getting more expensive, 
rising by three percent every year.
In response to the increasing 
pressure of student loans and debts, 
New York University (NYU) formally 
proposed a solution to its students: 
graduating in three years. They sug-
gested that by using Advanced Place-
ment (AP) credit from high school, 
taking the maximum number of 
credits every semester, and enroll-
ing in summer courses, students 
can pay one less year of tuition and 
relieve some of the ?nancial burden. 
In order to promote this “acceler-
ated” program, NYU will increase 
the number of three-credit courses 
offered and start accepting transfer 
credits from community colleges, 
which offer inexpensive summer 
courses.
Carnegie Mellon is similar to NYU 
in a lot of ways: they are both elite, 
private research universities located 
in cities, and among the most ex-
pensive colleges in the country. But 
instead of encouraging students to 
graduate early, Carnegie Mellon 
wants them to take their time. Most 
of the undergraduate academic pro-
grams are designed for four years 
of study, and the only accelerated 
programs encourage you to get a 
master’s degree within four or ?ve 
years. In other words, Carnegie Mel-
lon refuses to water down the weight 
carried by its degree.
Traditionally, Carnegie Mellon 
has one of the strictest policies on 
the conversion of AP credits, only 
accepting a score of ?ve in the ma-
jority of the subjects instead of both 
fours and ?ves like many of its peer 
schools. In early February, the Uni-
versity Task Force held the Add/
Drop/Withdraw Forum to announce 
their academic policy proposals, 
which includes a proposed change 
to the overloading policy. Instead of 
automatically removing the credit 
limit based on students’ QPAs, over-
loading requests will be examined 
and approved on a case-by-case ba-
sis. In order to enroll in more than 
54 units per semester, students 
would have to not only achieve the 
QPA limit of their own programs, 
but also gain approval from their ad-
visors. For the students who wish to 
?nish early, overloading is unavoid-
able, especially if they are looking to 
spend their summers working, par-
ticipating in internships, or gaining 
research experience.
These policies were proposed 
with good intentions in response 
to the overall stress culture at 
Carnegie Mellon. Given the 
competitive nature among 
students, having an of-
?cial plan to graduate 
early may compel more 
students -— who are 
very likely to be over-
worked and stressed 
— to push themselves 
even harder. These con-
cerns are real, and there is 
no point in denying the 
existence of stress cul-
ture, but there is another 
side to this story as well.
A fellow Carnegie 
Mellon student com-
plained earlier in the year 
that he was bored in the re-
quired courses. When he was 
choosing his courses for the spring 
semester, he was discouraged from 
overloading with more challenging 
courses, despite clearly demonstrat-
ing his ability to learn and excel. This 
semester, he ended up being bored 
by his courses again. And he is not 
alone: Many other people also face 
the same dilemma; they have the 
willingness and ability to learn and 
achieve more, but they are held back 
from their goals because of these 
policies. 
Blaming the stress culture on the 
few who are able to achieve more 
is absurd. Being a proudly diverse 
university, Carnegie Mellon should 
embrace not only differences in 
socioeconomic backgrounds, gen-
ders, races, but also the wide range 
of talented students it attracts. In-
stead of trying to normalize the dif-
ference, Carnegie Mellon should 
work to personalize the college ex-
perience for people with different 
abilities and goals. Providing a struc-
tured program for students with ad-
vanced knowledge, AP credits, and 
clear career goals early on would 
be less stressful for these students 
than leaving them to plan out their 
path on their own without guidance, 
sometimes secretly because they 
have been told to relax and not push 
themselves too hard.
But NYU’s plan to “cut costs” 
for college students does nothing 
to relieve the ?nancial burden on 
students, and possibly worsens it. 
A college education is becoming a 
minimum requirement for many 
jobs, and attending elite universities 
such as NYU and Carnegie Mellon 
would supposedly boost your chance 
of getting well-paying jobs. But the 
reason that the “requirement” ex-
ists is because a college degree holds 
some weight, and the knowledge 
one learns and the experience they-
accumulate during undergraduate 
years are crucial to their career suc-
cess. Offering “placeholder courses” 
that help students ful?ll graduation 
requirements reduces the content 
required for an undergraduate de-
gree and thereby reduces stress for 
the students who aim to ?nish in 
four years, but it also reduces the 
meaning of such a degree. Lowering 
the graduation requirement to make 
college more affordable would only 
result in employers and companies 
realizing that three-year degrees do 
not hold the same weight as four-
year ones, and the students will 
be paying for their shortcuts in the 
future.
Wesleyan University, a liberal 
arts college in Connecticut, began 
its formalized three-year bachelor’s 
degree program ?ve years ago. The 
plan speci?es that students who aim 
to graduate in three years not only 
have to overload during their aca-
demic semesters, but also enroll in 
approved summer courses every year 
in order to ?nish on time. These sum-
mer courses can be taken at other ac-
credited universities, but they can 
also be taken at community colleges, 
which offer a more affordable tuition 
rate and often easier, less in-depth 
courses. Accepting credits from com-
munity colleges and summer pro-
grams could be a trade-off, because 
the quality of these programs and 
courses vary among institutions.
People who attend elite colleges 
like Wesleyan and NYU are more 
competitive in the job market, not 
because these schools are some-
how inherently better than commu-
nity colleges, but because they offer 
stronger programs and courses that 
challenge their students to learn 
more. You may be able to take an 
introductory level computer science 
course anywhere else in the nation 
and get the same credit, but that ex-
perience will not level with taking 
15–112 at Carnegie Mellon. Carn-
egie Mellon is regarded more highly 
because of courses like 15–112: the 
fact that students have come out of 
the course with more expertise than 
their peers makes up the weight of 
the degree. Taking summer courses 
has another opportunity cost: in ad-
dition to not being able to take ad-
vantage of the academic resources 
within the university, students are 
also giving up their opportunities to 
take advantage of the university ca-
reer services, which could help you 
?nd research and internships over 
the summer.
Why do we take four years to ?n-
ish college? Michael S. Roth, the 
Wesleyan president thinks that there 
is nothing magical about the number 
four. “I think [?nishing college in 
four years] is just a convention,” he 
said. He was right: the importance of 
“four” has been overly emphasized 
among colleges. But just like a lot 
of educators, experts, critiques, and 
politicians (such as Ohio Governor 
John Kasich) who think graduat-
ing early is a solution to the tuition 
problem, he was wrong, ultimate-
ly, because by conforming to this, 
the higher education industry in 
America will suffer, and will pay for 
“dumbing down” their curriculum 
and taking this shortcut at the end. 
The three-year graduation plan can 
potentially bene?t the people who 
are already able to graduate early 
by pointing out a clear path, but for 
others, this plan simply adds to their 
stress and fear of missing out on such 
a “good deal.”

Knock Every Door stresses crucial role of listening in politics
Trump tax policy favors corporate elites, threatens workers
JEREMY GOLDSTEIN
Junior Staffwriter
Donald Trump rose to the presi-
dency largely by preaching a populist 
message of economic nationalism 
to stand up to neoliberal corporate 
globalization. The president is to be 
commended for remaining consistent 
on that message when it comes to his 
withdrawal from the Trans-Paci?c 
Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which 
gave provisions for corporations to 
change environmental, safety, and la-
bor laws of sovereign nations without 
the consent of the governed through 
seeking arbitration in the corporate-
representative dominated court 
known as the Investor State Dispute 
Settlement (ISDS). Still, whether Mr. 
Trump will actually make trade deals 
that advance the interests of workers 
remains to be seen, and the possibil-
ity exists that he might in fact make 
worse trade deals than the TPP. The 
opposite of anti-corporate economic 
nationalism is certainly being pur-
sued, however, in the President’s tax 
plan, which portends an alarming 
ceding of American leadership and a 
threat to democracy and sovereignty 
around the world.
Despite the good of maintain-
ing democratic institutions and 
sovereignty brought about by 
withdrawing from TPP 
and avoiding the ISDS, 
the downside is that 
it gives authoritar-
ian China — under 
whose hegemony en-
vironmental, safety, 
and labor standards 
are also unlikely to be 
met — the upper-
hand in setting eco-
nomic conditions 
for the Asia-Paci?c 
region. This abdi-
cation of Ameri-
can leadership in 
the region is all the 
more troubling consid-
ering that the Bank 
of China is a tenant 
in one of the presi-
dent’s buildings, and 
the president may be 
paying back loans from 
China. However, the pub-
lic cannot know if the loans are 
being paid, because the president has 
not released his taxes. Tough talk not-
withstanding, Trump showed China 
a sign of warmth in his appointment 
of Governor Terry Branstad (R-IA), 
who has a relationship with Chinese 
President Xi Jinping dating back to 
1985, to be the U.S. ambassador to 
Beijing.
The president’s tax plan calls for 
corporate taxes to be lowered from 
35 percent to 15 percent; the high-
est income tax bracket of individuals, 
who make $415,050 and over annu-
ally, to be lowered from 40 percent to 
32 percent; and the lowest taxpaying 
bracket of individuals, who make an-
nually $0 to $9275, to be increased 
from 10 percent to 12 percent. Such 
tax cuts for the rich and corporations, 
besides causing unfair increased tax 
burdens on those less able to afford 
it, are widely considered to be laying 
the groundwork for an explosion in 
the national debt (the nonpartisan 
Congressional Budget Of?ce esti-
mates $10 trillion growth in debt 
over the next 10 years, playing into 
the hands of China who owns 
much of the debt.
The Trump-GOP tax ar-
gument goes that in order 
to realistically provide Americans 
with jobs, the U.S. must repatriate bil-
lions of dollars of offshore corporate 
funds by incentivizing with a warmer 
business environment of deregula-
tion and lower taxes. They claim the 
economy will grow so much by lower-
ing restrictive taxes that government 
revenue will increase, despite taxing 
at a lower rate, because more people 
or items will be taxed than before 
since employment and consumption 
will increase substantially. Howev-
er, the experience of former Presi-
dents Ronald Reagan and H.W. Bush 
should show that revenue does not 
increase with supply-side economics 
because if taxes are effectively not be-
ing collected because they are so low 
during times of increased spending 
on the military and defense (as Mr. 
Trump proposes), then there will be 
no revenue for the government and 
debt will increase greatly as it indeed 
did under Reagan (from $1 trillion 
to $2.9 trillion, according to White 
House historical 
budget tables), which is why Bush 
famously, or rather infamously, had 
to raise taxes despite the campaign 
promise of his much-read lips.
Beyond a debt explosion, incentiv-
izing corporations to repatriate funds 
to the U.S. does not actually guaran-
tee substantial increase in good or 
equitable jobs. According to non-
partisan think tank, the Economic 
Policy Institute, “the CEO-to-worker 
compensation ratio, 20-to-1 in 1965, 
peaked at 376-to-1 in 2000 and was 
303-to-1 in 2014, far higher than in 
the 1960s, 1970s, 1980s, or 1990s.” 
Such pay disparity, combined with 
the President’s and the GOP’s oppo-
sition to raising the minimum wage, 
means that there is no guarantee that 
the jobs corporations provide are go-
ing to actually be well-paying.
Corporations increasingly use au-
tomation to replace human workers, 
a practice championed by the Presi-
dent’s withdrawn Labor Secretary 
pick, Hardee’s and Carl’s Jr. CEO 
Andy Puzder. A 2013 
study by Oxford researchers Dr. Mi-
chael A. Osborne and Dr. Carl Bene-
dikt Frey “estimated that 47 percent 
of jobs in the U.S. are ‘at risk’ of be-
ing automated in the next 20 years.” 
This means there is no guarantee that 
corporations repatriating funds will 
really result in substantial increases 
in human employees or that the jobs 
available will be not just accessible 
to those fortunate enough to receive 
university education. If the GOP is 
going to take credit for providing bet-
ter, higher-paying jobs for Americans 
in engineering or robotics, then it 
must back that up by supporting uni-
versal access to education that will 
support those careers. The adminis-
tration must at least execute a plan 
to signi?cantly lower student debt. 
It is unlikely, however, that the GOP 
would advance an expensive idea like 
universal education to which they are 
currently ideologically opposed.
Rather than beg corporations for 
alms in the form of employment by 
giving them carte blanche operation 
in our country, the U.S. should 
instead take the stance that 
our resources and labor 
force are valuable. It is 
the government acting 
on behalf of American 
workers that has lever-
age over corporations to 
demand that they pay their 
fair share of taxes, rather 
than let them off the hook 
with the excuse that they 
are job creators. With reve-
nue from corporate taxes, 
the government, which is 
controlled by the will of 
the voters, rather than 
corporations controlled 
by the will of the Board 
of Directors, can then 
fund good jobs in pub-
lic programs. Further-
more, the U.S. should 
use its great in?uence 
to lead other countries 
to tax corporations 
their fair share so na-
tions do not undergo 
a Hobbesian process 
of undercutting each 
other’s corporate tax 
rates, which is exactly 
the division that the 
corporate elites use 
to conquer.

On a lovely Sunday afternoon 
last weekend, I led a group of ?ve to 
Squirrel Hill to knock on doors and 
listen to the thoughts of complete 
strangers about the election. We took 
with us scripts with suggested ques-
tions about the candidates and par-
ties, but most of the time the people 
we talked to just wanted to freely 
vent their feelings. Our job was sim-
ply to listen, not to argue or push an 
agenda. I held the event in collabora-
tion with Carnegie Mellon College 
Democrats and a new national or-
ganization called Knock Every Door, 
which trains volunteers across the 
country to host similar canvasses lo-
cally. The information we and other 
canvassers collected will eventually 
go to the Democratic party and the 
media in a report to help make the 
party stronger and more attentive for 
future elections.
Knock Every Door was created 
in the wake of the 2016 election by 
former Bernie Sanders staffers and 
other progressives. The idea behind 
the organization is that by listening 
to people of diverse ideological be-
liefs about what they need from their 
government and what motivates 
them to vote, we can create a uni?ed, 
progressive, grassroots movement to 
dismantle “Trumpism.”
2016 saw unprecedented num-
bers of registered Democrats not 
showing up to the polls or, worse, 
voting for Trump. If progressives are 
to take back the country, we’ll need 
to build a revolution that addresses 
both social and economic issues and 
gets everyone back on the same page.
This sort of canvassing with the 
primary purpose of listening rather 
than talking is called deep canvas-
sing, and a recent political science 
study out of Stanford University 
and the University of California at 
Berkeley found that it works: the 
best way to change voters’ minds is 
to have respectful conversations with 
them and really listen. When a can-
vasser approaches a voter with the 
intent of listening and understand-
ing, the voter will be more open to 
listening to and considering the can-
vasser’s views in return.
When I went out myself, I found 
that people were surprisingly grate-
ful to just have someone listen 
non-judgmentally to their random 
thoughts. Since Squirrel Hill is a 
fairly liberal area, three out of the 
four people I had full conversations 
with were Hillary Clinton voters. 
Their feelings ranged from a disbelief 
in Trump’s power or desire to actu-
ally accomplish the things he cam-
paigned on to a deep fear that the 
rich will get richer and everyone else 
will suffer. All had been primarily 
content with President Obama and 
were frustrated with the leadership 
of the Democratic Party. The Clin-
ton voters were most concerned with 
civil rights and how Trump will harm 
the Americans who already struggle 
the most to help themselves, such 
as undocumented immigrants and 
working mothers.
The one Trump voter I heard from 
mentioned her distrust of politicians 
of both parties and her belief that 
they make money at the expense of 
voters. She also believed that the 
Obama administration was anti-
Semitic in their dealings with Israel 
and, as a descendant of a Holocaust 
survivor herself, had a deep distaste 
for anyone getting between the Jews 
and their homeland.
Back in 2008, she supported 
Clinton, but changed her mind after 
the Benghazi scandal and wished 
that Clinton had at least apologized. 
She thinks that Trump will provide 
more jobs for Americans who want to 
work, and that the only people who 
will suffer from a Trump presidency 
are people who are lazy or violent or 
otherwise wildly break the rules of 
civilized society. I was surprised to 
?nd that she didn’t vote for Trump 
because of his racism but in spite of 
it, and, in fact, that she believed Clin-
ton to be the more racist candidate.
From my liberal Democratic 
background, this woman’s opinions 
sounded to me like they were 
based in falsehoods, but we 
did have one thing in 
common: we 
both voted for the candidate we be-
lieved would make people’s lives 
better. My vote was about bettering 
the lives of marginalized people and 
protecting public resources. Her vote 
was about rewarding hard workers.
This sort of conversation, where 
a progressive and a conservative re-
spectfully listen to each other’s dif-
fering opinions, has become largely 
unheard of. Progressives and con-
servatives have come to exist in such 
separate spaces that we have all but 
ceased to see the humanity in each 
other. From feminists to the alt-right 
people on both sides are regularly 
called Nazis — that is, equated with 
pure evil — whether they are or not. 
We have lost sight of the difference 
between people who intend to harm 
others and people who unintention-
ally cause harm.
Even though the effect of the two 
groups’ actions may be the same, it’s 
an important distinction to make, 
because the former are truly bad 
people through-and-through, 
while the latter want others 
to be happy and healthy and 
would be open to changing 
their actions if they were ap-
propriately approached and 
educated on the consequences 
of said actions. Progressives 
ought to enable the personal 
growth of such people as much 
as possible.
Some Trump supporters are 
deserving of the title of “Nazi”, but 
I believe that most were severely 
conned into believing that Trump 
would make people’s lives better. If 
we paint all conservatives as pure 
evil, they will go running back to 
ego-pumping candidates like Trump 
and become even more set in their 
beliefs. If we give them a space to 
express their needs and then explain 
our needs to them, we can work to-
gether to meet everyone’s needs. 
The conversations that come out of 
Knock Every Door canvasses begin 
this important work.
Listening to strangers with harm-
ful opinions may not be for every-
one, but if you have the time and the 
emotional energy to do so, I would 
recommend attending or organizing 
a deep canvass, because listening 
should be at the foreground of pro-
gressive change.

ly ?ne in terms of his policy positions 
and ideas for the Democratic Party, 
he represents a brand of political 
thought that simply has not served 
Democrats well. Already, Republi-
cans have branded Perez a “D.C. In-
sider,” promoting the 2016 election 
narrative that Democrats are out-
of-touch and elite. After Perez’s vic-
tory, Trump tweeted, “Congratula-
tions to Thomas Perez, who has just 
been named Chairman of the DNC. 
I could not be happier for him, or 
for the Republican Party!” Though 
Perez and Ellison were really pretty 
similar, voting for Perez silences the 
already disgruntled progressives 
within the Democratic Party and 
sends a loud and clear signal that 
the Democratic Party is not at all in-
terested in listening to the American 
people or learning from its mistakes.
Albert Einstein is often attrib-
uted as de?ning insanity as trying 
the same thing again and again 
but expecting a different result. Be-
tween 2008 and 2016, the Demo-
cratic Party installed establishment 
leaders like Debbie Wasserman-
Schultz, who led the party to stun-
ning and embarrassing electoral 
defeats across the country. In 2016, 
Democrats backed an establishment 
candidate for president who squan-
dered the safest and easiest presi-
dential race in memory. Democrats 
have started 2017 by once again al-
lowing the inertia of the status quo 
to overwhelm the energy within 
their party at the grassroots and 
within the progressive wing. Until 
Democrats embrace the progressive 
elements within their party, boldly 
message why their agenda serves 
the American people, and soberly 
assess their shortcomings on policy, 
messaging, and organization, they 
will continue to lose.

The 2016 election was anything 
but normal and has left the United 
States in a state of heightened ten-
sions. When the president who wins 
an election loses the popular vote, 
political polarization runs rampant 
and scrutiny is microscopic. Donald 
Trump has the lowest approval rat-
ings of any recent president. While 
criticism for Trump arises from a va-
riety of actions and statements, the 
criticism that paints news headlines 
is that he is mentally un?t to be Pres-
ident of the United States. Not only 
is this claim false, but it insults the 
mentally ill and further stigmatizes 
mental illness.
A number of psychologists and 
psychiatrists have spoken out against 
Trump, stating that he is a narcis-
sist and mentally un?t for of?ce. A 
number have even signed a Change.
org petition, that has garnered over 
35,000 signatures calling for the di-
agnosis of Trump. Thirty-?ve men-
tal health professionals then took 
it a step further, and published an 
article in The New York Times declar-
ing that Trump is emotionally un?t 
to be president of the United States 
without being personally examined 
by them.
The declaration of these men-
tal health professionals violates the 
Goldwater Rule. The Goldwater Rule 
does not allow psychiatrists to speak 
publicly about the mental health 
of person of media attention unless 
they have examined this person and 
have received permission to release a 
statement. This rule does not techni-
cally apply to psychologists, but they 
should also practice it to avoid fur-
ther stigmatization of mental illness.
If these psychologists were ac-
tually concerned with President 
Trump’s well-being and were not po-
litically motivated, they would have 
attempted to contact to President 
Trump for an examination. Or, had 
they felt that had suf?cient evidence 
already to diagnose him, they would 
have contacted his of?ce regarding 
his diagnosis. They would have of-
fered steps on how to lessen the ef-
fects of his condition. But instead, 
they published a letter in The New 
York Times, diagnosing him with a 
mental illness that even the psychol-
ogist who helped create the criteria 
for diagnosing narcissism does not 
think Trump has. Allen Frances, who 
helped categorize narcissism, notes 
that “he may be a world-class narcis-
sist, but this doesn’t make him men-
tally ill because he does not suffer 
from the stress and impairment re-
quired to diagnose mental disorder.” 
Simply put, he is sel?sh, but he’s not 
mentally ill.
Labeling Trump as mentally ill is 
a lame attempt to delegitimatize the 
president. He is not mentally ill, and 
mental health professionals need to 
refrain from giving ill informed opin-
ions on politicians. There are a fair 
amount of valid criticisms — from 
not allowing certain news organiza-
tions into press brie?ngs to the ex-
pensive, illogical wall — that there is 
no need to resort to lowness of call-
ing President Trump mentally un-
stable. Even if his policies were not 
seriously ?awed, mental illness is not 
something to hold against someone 
you disagree with.
Statistics from the National 
Alliance on Mental Illness show that 
one in ?ve Americans suffer from 
mental illness, and less than half re-
ceive help. Mental health profession-
als know this, so the fact that they 
still label Trump as mentally unsta-
ble only adds to the damage. People 
need to be encouraged to seek help, 
and these insults only make it more 
dif?cult for those suffering to reach 
out.
Trump has his own history of 
ostracizing those who he disagrees 
with (let’s not forget he champi-
oned the birther movement against 
President Obama), but that does 
not mean anyone should stoop to 
this level. Mental illness is a real is-
sue in America, and a group many 
of those who are against President 
Trump have vowed to protect. Label-
ing the President of the United States 
mentally ill, when he is clearly not, 
directly contradicts this. Americans 
seem to forget that while we all have 
difference in opinion, at the end of 
the day, we all want what is best for 
this great country. Let’s leave the 
name-calling and played-out insults 
outside of political discussions, and 
instead focus on the issues at stake 
under President Trump: immigra-
tion, healthcare, education, and 
most importantly, free speech.

‘Mentally ill’ does not describe Trump
Overcoming shyness is a vital life skillMoving to Canada will not ?x America’s issues
MADELINE KIM
Junior Staffwriter
Wednesday, Nov. 9, 2016 was a 
day people from all over the world 
will remember as the day Donald 
Trump was announced as the 45th 
President of the United States. Of 
course, a sizable proportion of the 
nation was relieved to have averted 
a Clinton administration, but the 
majority felt waves of panic. Cana-
da’s immigration website crashed 
due to “a higher than normal level 
of traf?c.” Sure, the website may 
be available again, and the idea of 
crossing the border is tempting for 
many, but that does not mean mov-
ing to Canada is a good idea if one’s 
incentive lies in leaving the swamp 
that has consumed the White House.
Of course, “I’m moving to Cana-
da” is not a sentiment that is unique 
to the 2016 presidential election. 
As Prime Minister Justin Trudeau 
pointed out to Elizabeth Plank of 
Vox News, this idea of moving to 
Canada has been a somewhat reoc-
curring theme, at least for the past 
few elections. However, the number 
of people from the U.S. immigrating 
to Canada do not necessarily line up 
to the results of the elections held in 
the twenty-?rst century. This trend, 
though, was broken with the elec-
tion of President Donald Trump. Ex-
act numbers are not known yet, but 
it has been estimated that about 139 
people crossed through Emerson, 
Manitoba to seek asylum and a spike 
of people have crossed through 
Hemmingford, Quebec.
Canada seems appealing for 
many reasons: the lack of President 
Trump, affordable healthcare, and 
the charismatic Trudeau, to list a 
few. Our neighbor’s history shows 
that it is not the utopia that the ste-
reotypes make it out to be. It is, how-
ever, a nation with a history we can 
learn from.
Prior to Trudeau, Canada was 
led by a conservative PM, Stephen 
Harper, for almost ten years. Some 
of the policies he implemented were 
at odds with many Canadians’ be-
liefs, such as the Zero Tolerance for 
Barbaric Cultural Practices Act — 
which banned polygamy, a practice 
that was already illegal — and the 
appeal to ban women from wear-
ing the niqab. Although Canada had 
more progressive aspects such as 
marriage equality and single-payer 
healthcare, Harper undeniably went 
against the wishes of many Canadi-
ans throughout his administration.
On Wednesday, Oct. 20, 2015, 
Canada prevented Harper from 
completing his tenth year as PM by 
replacing him with Trudeau. Since 
then, the Canadian government has 
made many progressive strides such 
as dropping the appeal of the con-
troversial niqab ban, making the Ca-
nadian cabinet more representative 
with an equal number of men and 
women, and opening Canada’s arms 
to welcome refugees.
As appealing as it is to cross the 
border, it is time to re?ect on our-
selves, look at what our neighbor 
has done, and create a course of 
action to make the upcoming years 
of a Trump administration the best 
they can be. Yes, as former President 
Barack Obama said, the sun will rise 
in the morning, but merely relying 
on our planet’s orbit around the sun 
is not going to miraculously imple-
ment political change. Instead of 
envying the fruits of our neighbor, it 
is far more constructive to see how 
the fruits were harvested and try to 
plan out how to implement these 
lessons in our future.
What made the 2015 election 
in Canada so momentous was the 
voter turnout. Each province saw an 
increase and the overall nation saw 
a voter turnout of 68.49 percent —
the highest it has been since 1993. 
On the other hand, the U.S. saw the 
lowest voter turnout since 1996. Ap-
proximately 55 percent of eligible 
voters actually casted their ballots. 
Many factors may have contributed 
to this low turnout, including am-
bivalence towards the results or in-
?exibility of workers’ schedules, but 
regardless, this demonstrates the 
importance of voting.
Had Canadians given up hope in 
not having the same PM in of?ce, 
perhaps their government would 
have continued in the trajectory it 
was headed, but they realized that 
they had some degree of power over 
their government and changed their 
political route. This was not a fool-
proof plan by any means, but the 
people did their part in participating 
in a democratic society.
America is a nation that prides 
itself in fair and free elections. But 
there is still work for us to do. Stay-
ing abreast with current events is 
another critical factor. However, 
instead of solely expressing discon-
tent within our echoic chambers, re-
spond to injustice by calling senators 
and representatives accordingly. The 
elections that deserve our attention 
are not simply limited to the presi-
dential elections. We must go out 
and participate in our congressio-
nal elections and our state elections 
just the same. As in?uential as our 
president is, he is but one man, and 
thus we must ensure he has a strong 
team to guide our nation. This is the 
beauty of a democracy. We all have 
voices, but this gift shows its signi?-
cance only if we use it.
As in many other instances, run-
ning away from a problem is sig-
ni?cantly easier in the short-run. 
However, the consequences that we 
evade can conglomerate into some-
thing of grander proportions later 
on. As we have seen in our previous 
election, downplaying the chance 
of a Trump administration arguably 
led us to where we, as a nation, are 
today. Instead of packing our bags 
and leaving for a country that ap-
pears to be prospering and progress-
ing in ways we appear to struggle, 
let us remind ourselves where the 
U.S. and Canada were approxi-
mately a year and a half ago — the 
U.S. had Democrat Barack Obama; 
Canada had Conservative Prime 
Minister Stephen Harper. Perhaps 
there have been some Canadians 
who were tempted to cross the bor-
der to leave a government that they 
did not approve of or found “cruel 
and unusual.”
Despite this adversity, they 
fought a peaceful political battle by 
banding together and voting for a 
PM who advocated for “real change 
now” throughout the campaign 
trail. Decreasing potential votes can-
not help a democracy or a situation; 
in fact, it can exacerbate both. Let us 
allow Canada to be an example of 
how to stay calm and progress as a 
democratic society rather than a re-
sort to which we can ?ee if things do 
not go our way.

Being shy is cute when you are 
still ?ve years old and people are 
pinching your cheeks and giggling 
with glee while watching your face 
?ush as you tuck yourself behind 
your mother’s dress. But when you’re 
all grown up and off to college? Not 
so much.
I have been overshadowed, 
and would even go so far as to say 
“plagued”, by this personality trait 
of timidity my entire life — and I just 
can’t seem to get entirely rid of it.
I am not alone — nearly half of all 
Americans report feeling the same 
way. Yet when working my way 
through a throng, it can still feel like 
I am the only one.
People always seem to say you 
should “remain true to yourself” 
and “don’t ever feel like you have to 
change,” but when a large chunk of 
your own self holds you back from 
seizing opportunities and enriching 
your life, then I say it’s time to reas-
sess the conditions under which you 
operate and re-wire your circuity a 
tad.
At times, it often ends up feeling 
like I have two different people bash-
ing heads inside of me; one an extro-
verted being and the other a massive 
introvert, who overpowers and muf-
?es the extroverted personality for 
fear of being too loud. Sometimes I 
feel limited by it, but I believe that 
we are all capable of overcoming our 
internal limits to begin to climb to 
the external, seemingly-unbounded 
ladder of our own futures that awaits 
if only we can free ourselves from an 
incessant, often random, and unre-
lenting fear.
When this slightly irrational fear 
occurs, a con?ict of interest hap-
pens right inside of you. On the one 
hand, you want more than anything 
to feel relatively at ease confronting 
large seas of unfamiliar faces and 
settings. But at the same time, as you 
step into the wave of people, it sucks 
you down, your stomach drops, and 
your smile is really a half grimace 
as you feel your insides lurch. You 
feel like part of you 
is betraying yourself, holding you 
back, an angry and poor emotion. 
Being angry, though, is nothing but 
an idle feeling unless you use it as a 
spurring motivator toward change. 
Simply remaining upset at yourself 
will only further drag you back.
Yes, it is a part of my personality 
and my quirks and a part of what 
makes me “me”. But when it begins 
to interfere with what I desire and 
my life in a larger context, when it 
surpasses that threshold and begins 
to affect me emotionally in a man-
ner that is detrimental rather than 
constructive, then that’s the point 
where it’s no longer just a part of my 
personality, but more akin to a para-
site living on my shoulder pulling me 
away from the things that are a ?n-
ger’s width from my reach.
But why is shyness so dif?cult to 
overcome? Why is it such a power-
ful emotion, and why does it have so 
much control over our lives?
Shyness is complex and often 
misunderstood. As largely social 
creatures, humans may perceive the 
act of drawing away from other fel-
low human beings can be perceived 
as unnatural. In our brilliant age of 
a technological revolution, it has be-
come even easier, increasingly so, to 
then isolate yourself, succumbing to 
the tendency to draw away and fare 
on one’s own. But retreating is not a 
remedy and only further contributes 
to the issue, pulling you further from 
the possibilities of the world.
Perhaps there was a point long 
ago where shyness wasn’t such 
a bad thing — maybe it was to a 
Neanderthal’s bene?t 
to err on the 
more timid side and avoid grunting 
brawls. Maybe the shy ones lived 
a little bit longer. But the times are 
no longer prehistoric and now, if you 
want to ever make it to the history 
books, you have to be able to put 
yourself out there, network, make 
connections, and talk to people — 
it’s a large and hungry power game. 
But if you’re hungry, even if you’re 
starving, and you don’t bring the 
right utensils (read: life skills) or eti-
quette (read: people skills), you can’t 
have a piece of the cake.
Social structures are not accom-
modating for the shy. But in order to 
succeed in our “go-go-go” world of 
today, it is a barrier that must be sur-
mounted. I’ve adapted to encompass 
the “fake it till you make it” mantra 
as a successful strategy. When faced 
with gut-wrenching unfamiliarity, I 
envision the persona of a successful 
and charming character that I would 
aspire to be in the certain context. In 
molding myself into the personality 
I would like to exude, life becomes 
an acting exercise, almost enjoyable, 
and I proceed under false con?dence 
that slowly solidi?es into a tangible 
one. Things become more approach-
able and opportunities stop slipping 
past my reach as I break forward and 
take the push to ?rmly, and some-
what con?dently, grasp them.
That is not to say that shyness is 
entirely negative. There are varying 
degrees and shades of reservation 
and various elements at play. You 
just have to make sure shyness does 
not begin to govern and dictate your 
life.

Seven Earth-sized 
planets found at nearby dwarf-star
Seven Earth-like planets 
have been found orbiting a 
dwarf-star called TRAPPIST-1, 
40 light-years away. The 
planets possibly contain 
oceans of water, meaning they 
could host extra-terrestrial life. 
The planets were discovered 
by an international team of 
astronomers, led by Michael 
Gillon of the University of 
Liege in Belgium, that studied 
the star for extended periods.
Astronomers have a series 
of techniques for discovering 
exo-planets (i.e. planets 
outside the solar system). 
They can observe how the 
luminosity of a star drops 
when a planet passes in front 
of it. However, this requires the 
Earth, the planet, and the host 
star to be on the same plane. 
Another methods involves 
observing the tug planets 
exert on their sun, which 
causes the star to wobble. 
Information about the mass 
and distance of the planets can 
then be deduced. The latter 
method, however, only works 
for large planets, such as gas 
giants (like Jupiter). Finding 
smaller planets, such as Earth-
sized ones, is much harder and 
an astounding feat.

Sexual harassment 
and sexist culture at Uber is exposed
Former Uber software 
developer Susan Fowler wrote 
in a blog post about the sexual 
harassment she encountered 
while working at the ride-
sharing company.
Uber has faced many 
controversies since its launch 
in 2011, from incessant cases 
of sexual assault by its drivers 
to taxi driver protests and 
blockage from operation in 
some cities. This latest news 
break only continues the 
theme and shows how far 
the company still has to go 
to improve conditions for its 
customers and employees. 
Uber’s CEO Travis Kalanick 
has since apologized for the 
the company’s work culture 
issues after the blog post 
raised concerns.
Reports of sexist working 
conditions for women in tech 
have sprung up continuously. 
In September 2016, an Apple 
employee revealed the sexist 
working conditions at the 
company, which included rape 
jokes, misogyny, and sexual 
harassment.
In the rest of her blog 
post, Fowler chronicles how 
human resources (HR) at Uber 
ignored her reports of sexism.

5G will be a central 
topic at the Mobile World Congress
TelCom companies are 
about to take the next step 
after 4G. By about 2020, 5G 
will be the next data commu-
nication standard, and it will 
be blindingly quick. It’s about 
more than mobile phone net-
works, though. 5G will be 
the backbone of faster wi-? 
networks in homes, drones, 
self-driven cars, virtual reality, 
and the internet of things. 
Speeds of up to 10 Gbps (Giga-
bits per second) will be com-
monplace, allowing users to 
download the largest ?les 
(think Lord of the Rings ?lm 
trilogy) in seconds.
At the Mobile World 
Congress in Barcelona next 
week, 5G is expected to 
be a central topic. Mobile 
companies are already testing 
new infrastructure that will 
support the faster bandwidth.
5G will operate in the high-
frequency 30 GHz and 300 
GHz bandwidths, known as 
the millimeter wave spectrum. 
Even though high frequency 
waves come with faster data 
transfer, they also have issues 
bending around obstacles and 
traveling as far as the lower 
frequencies used for 4G LTE. 
5G thus has long way to go.

Microbes survived 
inside cave crystals for 50,000 years
Microbes that live off iron 
and sulfur were found live 
in pockets of ?uid within the 
crystals of a cave in Mexico. 
The researchers who found 
the microbes say they are 
still alive after a 50,000 year 
hibernation. This discovery 
continues the trend of micro-
scopic life on Earth managing 
to survive in the harshest 
environments. “This has 
profound effects on how 
we try to understand the 
evolution of microbial life on 
Earth,” says Penelope Boston, 
the director of the NASA 
Astrobiology Institute.
Boston’s teams collected 
samples of the dormant 
microbes in 2008, awakened 
them and grew cultures. The 
microbes were distinct from 
any forms of microscopic life 
on Earth at the present.
The resilience of these 
microbes may present a 
problem for the search for 
extraterrestrial life. If they are 
present on space exploration 
equipment and survive 
the journey, they could 
contaminate other worlds 
upon contact. The durability 
of the microbes will undergo 
more studies.

Special to The Tartan
This week at Student Pug-
wash, the science, technology, 
and society discussion club 
undertook one of the most 
dif?cult exercises under our 
jurisdiction: listing and order-
ing all the problems humanity 
needs to face. A daunting task 
for even the most stable of 
governments, the challenge 
was taken head on by our 
team and we delivered a ?nal 
ranking of all the issues we 
thought were important. By 
the end of the meeting, we had 
a de?nitive list — sort of.
Initially, we intended to 
make a short list of speci?c 
problems such as climate 
change, superbugs, and 
political extremism. However, 
in the ?rst hour alone, we 
had produced up to 30 issues. 
Therefore, it was necessary 
to view the task through a 
different lens.
In an attempt to 
organize our list, we started 
categorizing the individual 
items, as many had overlap-
ping root causes with po-
tentially overlapping solu-
tions. For example, the ?rst 
category was concerned with 
ideological problems, such as 
extremism and xenophobia. 
Then, we moved on to another 
category: social issues, which 
includes problems like aging 
populations.
Eventually, our list was 
reduced to six unordered 
issues that could be 
categorized easily. They were 
ideological, economic, social, 
public health, technological, 
and environmental issues.
Next, we undertook the 
slightly less daunting task of 
ranking these six groups. To 
lessen the potential for major 
disagreements, we began 
from the bottom with sixth 
most pressing issue almost 
unanimously agreed to be 
ideological in nature.
This is because there is 
one major difference that 
ideological problems have 
from the rest, in that the 
solutions are less de?nitive 
and somewhat ambiguous. 
Questions of what constitutes 
a good ideology have plagued 
philosophers and politicians 
for centuries, and even now 
there is no clear way to solve 
these problems without some 
level of ethical breaching. 
Therefore, it was accepted 
that ideology would be some-
thing not easily solvable, and 
so it was placed sixth.
The next to be put on 
the list was technology. Like 
ideology, we also had the 
uni?ed opinion to place it 
second to last, since there 
seemed to be fewer pressing 
issues within the category 
than in others. Furthermore, 
most of those under the 
technology umbrella were also 
in other categories as well.
The fourth was health, 
which generated much 
discussion. This is because 
Pugwash recently covered 
the concerns over superbugs, 
which hinge on fears of a 
global epidemic without an 
effective cure. Unfortunately, 
even though fear of superbugs 
is a very legitimate concern, 
the lack of possible pathogens 
that could annihilate all 
humanity subtracted from the 
topic’s relative importance. 
Disease and disability also 
seemed to be more of an 
economic conundrum, with 
some treatment applications 
correlating with personal 
wealth and social standing.
We were then faced with 
the task of ordering the ?nal 
three categories, namely 
economics, social, and 
environmental. Unfortunately, 
we never completed the rank-
ing, as it became clear that 
these three generated the 
most controversy over rank-
ings. In the end, we agreed 
to rank them all as ?rst. 
The underlying connections 
between these three topics 
made isolating them 
challenging. Furthermore, 
varying time frames for 
their potential dangers and 
solutions confounded the 
ability to rank them.
The arguments for the 
ordering of these ?nal three 
topics were impassioned and 
insightful, digging into the 
complexities of what exactly 
it means for one catastrophe 
to be more pressing than the 
next. Others began to reject 
the established ordering of 
the fourth, ?fth, and sixth 
topics as well. By the end of 
the meeting, we certainly had 
not compiled the de?nitive, 
ordered list of our planet’s 
most dire needs. In fact, there 
are hundreds of extinction-
level events that are more than 
possible of occurring.
We accomplished far 
more meaningful goals 
along the way. We explored 
the structure, complexities 
and relationships between 
the trials of humanity. By 
categorizing and considering 
these topics, the unfathomable 
challenges of the 21st century 
seemed more, if only by a bit 
more, understandable.

Hundreds of scientists 
congregated to protest 
President Trump’s “anti-
science” rhetoric on Sunday, 
Feb. 19. They demanded that 
he begin tackling climate 
change instead of ignoring 
it and overturn his gag-
orders on the Environment 
Protection Agency (EPA). 
Others were present to protest 
Trump’s selection of Scott 
Pruitt to head of the EPA. 
Pruitt has previously been 
publicly opposed to the EPA 
and environmental protection. 
The rally was held at Copley 
Square in Boston, just outside 
the American Association for 
the Advancement of Science’s 
annual meeting.
Protesters held signs that 
read serious messages such 
as “Science Matters” and 
“Scientists Pursuing Truth, 
Saving the World,” and some 
with comical phrases like 
“Make America Smart Again.” 
One protester, Geoffrey 
Supran, said “We’re really 
trying to send a message today 
to Mr. Trump that America 
runs on science — it is the 
backbone of our prosperity 
and progress.” This science 
rally comes amidst sev-
eral demographics, includ-
ing women, Democrats, the 
LGBTQ community, and the 
latino community protesting 
some aspect of the Trump 
administration and its policies.
One of Trump’s ?rst actions 
as president was to place a 
gag-order on the EPA, prevent-
ing it from communicating 
with the public. This falls in 
line with Trump’s views, as he 
has stated he believes global 
warming is a hoax invented 
by the Chinese to weaken the 
American economy.
The Trump administration 
seems to care little for 
the environment. This is 
evident in its decision to 
allow construction of the 
controversial Dakota Access 
Pipeline — the Obama 
administration had rejected 
its construction. Furthermore, 
the appointment of ExonMo-
bil CEO Rex Tillerson as sec-
retary of state con?rms the 
new government’s rejection of 
clean energy initiatives.
It is generally accepted 
that this presidential term 
will be a challenge for the 
science community. For 
the ?rst time in eight years, 
environmentalists will have 
to ?ght their government 
to protect the environment 
effectively. Governmental 
science organizations, such 
as NASA, can expect their 
budgets to be tremendously 
slashed, as Trump funds 
his other initiatives like 
the estimated $25 billion 
border wall and a costly mass 
deportation force.
The government has 
steadily reduced its scienti?c 
and technological research 
budget since the space race. 
NASA, for example, receives 
0.5 percent of the federal 
budget at the moment. This 
trend will continue under 
Trump, squeezing researchers 
even more into the corner. 
Despite the seemingly 
gloomy next four years for 
science, it has much to look 
forward to.

SpaceX’s reusable rockets make space travel much cheaper
HOW THINGS WORK
Terrorism research at Carnegie Mellon focuses on objectivity
RESEARCH SPOTLIGHT
JULIA NAPOLITANO
Staffwriter
De?ning terrorism is often 
dif?cult and vague, especially 
because people consider it to 
mean different things. One 
man’s terrorist is another’s 
freedom ?ghter, after all. 
Oftentimes, it is even more 
dif?cult to separate fact from 
political agenda. Terrorism 
is generally thought to be 
the unlawful use of violence 
and intimidation, especially 
against civilians, in the pursuit 
of political aims. 
In an article, titled 
“Challenges in researching 
terrorism from the ?eld,” 
published in Science Policy 
Forum last month, experts 
from different ?elds explored 
several different aspects of re-
search into terrorism.
These researchers include 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Baruch Fischhoff, a decision 
scientist and Howard Heinz 
University professor in the 
Institute for Politics and 
Strategy, and Department of 
Engineering and Public Policy; 
Scott Atran, an anthropologist 
at Paris’ Centre National de 
la Recherche Scienti?que 
and cofounder of ARTIS 
International; Robert Axelrod, 
a University of Michigan 
political scientist; and Richard 
Davis, a former White House 
policy advisor now at the 
University of Oxford.
Acknowledging that there 
are fundamental aspects of 
terrorism that remain unclear, 
they asked the questions, 
“What identi?es terrorists 
before they act? How do they 
radicalize? What motivates 
their violence? When do they 
act? What countermeasures 
are most effective?”
They attribute the lack of 
answers to these questions 
to ?aws in how terrorism 
is currently researched. 
The scientists propose an 
alternative design to research-
ing terrorism, one driven by 
theoretically informed ?eld 
research integrated with 
policy-making. They aim to 
use ?eld data to better inform 
and test hypotheses related to 
terrorism.
“Bridging theory and 
practice is always challenging, 
and particularly when diverse 
forms of expertise are needed, 
and the people who have it lack 
opportunities, and perhaps 
incentives, for collaboration,” 
said Fischhoff in a university 
press release. “Research that 
overcomes these barriers is a 
hallmark of Carnegie Mellon 
and of the projects featured 
in our article. It is essential if 
the social sciences are to make 
their essential contributions 
to the fundamentally human 
problems that terrorism 
re?ects and represents.”
More advanced research 
into how terrorists think 
may be the key to preventing 
future tragedies. Ensuring 
the legal and ethical stand-
ing of terrorism research 
through national review 
boards will also legitimize 
the information, as opposed 
to obtaining information 
through unreliable means 
such as torture.
“To be more successful 
in combating terrorism, 
governments should look at 
how they can build research 
capacity that is properly 
funded, independent of 
governmental interference, 
and grounded in systematic 
data collection, checking 
and analyses that is devoid 
of politics,” said Atran in a 
university press release.
Terrorism is a recurring 
topic in today’s political 
climate. Many have seen the 
havoc terrorist organizations 
can reek in countries far from 
the war-torn areas. The mem-
ory of Sep. 11, 2001 is fresh 
on many Americans’ minds. 
Unfortunately, politicians 
play on the electorate’s fears 
and strong emotions. Such 
subjectivity cannot make its 
way into research. 
Interestingly, researchers 
have found that terrorism 
is one of the worst methods 
of achieving a political 
goal. In a book called Why 
Civil Resistance Works: The 
Strategic Logic of Nonviolent 
Con?ict authored by Erica 
Chenoweth, a political scientist 
at Columbia University, and 
Maria Stephan, a senior fellow 
at the U.S. Institute of Peace, 
it is revealed that terrorism 
achieves its political aims only 
about 25 percent of the time, 
yet nonviolent methods are 
successful half the time.

Launching things into 
space is expensive — really 
expensive. A rocket costs more 
than a commercial jet. But un-
like jets that make thousands 
of trips before being retired, 
rockets are used only once 
because of the extreme stress 
and temperatures involved in 
leaving and re-entering the 
atmosphere.
SpaceX wants to change 
that. Founder Elon Musk 
believes that reusable rockets 
will eliminate the prohibitive 
cost of space travel and 
allow space travel to become 
commonplace.
Most modern rockets are 
multi-stage, built of multiple 
parts that each have their 
own engines and fuel. When 
each stage runs out of fuel, 
it falls back to Earth, and the 
next stage begins burning its 
propellant. The lighter mass 
makes it easier to accelerate 
the payload to escape velocity.
This system works well 
for getting things into space, 
but isn’t very ef?cient or cost-
effective. The jettisoned rocket 
stages essentially become 
trash, cluttering Earth’s orbit 
or polluting its oceans. New 
rockets are then constructed 
for tens of millions of dollars.
SpaceX’s rockets don’t 
operate this way. After 
separating from the payload, 
instead of falling back to 
Earth, the ?rst stage rocket 
decelerates itself with bursts 
of fuel and uses ?ns to steer 
onto a landing platform. When 
reusable rockets become 
commonplace and are more 
widely adopted, according to 
Musk, these landing platforms 
will be autonomous pods 
?oating in the ocean. The 
?rst successful landing of a 
SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was in 
December 2015. However, the 
?rst successful rocket water 
landing was in April 2016. This 
week, a Falcon rocket was the 
?rst private rocket to launch 
from the historic NASA launch 
pad at the Kennedy Space 
Center in Cape Canaveral, 
Florida.
The idea behind reusable 
rockets seems simple enough, 
so why is this concept just 
now being tested? Traditional 
launch systems are designed 
to maximize performance 
and reliability. Government 
designers and engineers 
prioritize the safe completion 
of the intended mission on 
the ?rst try over sustainability 
or ef?ciency. As former NASA 
administrator Alan Stern 
explains, “[The Department of 
Defense] doesn’t care whether 
it costs $100 million or $300 
million ... what they want is a 
guarantee it’s going to work.” 
And these systems do work. 
The Atlas V launch vehicle, 
sometimes called “the world’s 
most reliable rocket,” uses a 
different type of rocket for 
each stage, with up to three 
different kinds of propellant. 
This made the rockets 
extremely powerful and 
precise, but largely expensive 
to manufacture and fuel.
The Falcon rocket is 
designed to minimize cost 
— a liberty SpaceX can take 
as a private company. All its 
engines are the same kind, 
running on liquid oxygen and 
RP1, a fuel made from re?ned 
kerosene. 
The Falcon’s two stages 
are the same diameter and 
made from an aluminum-
lithium alloy. The use of the 
same material for each stage 
reduces manufacturing costs.
SpaceX also keeps costs 
down by manufacturing its 
own engines in-house. The 
Merlin engines designed for 
the Falcon use a needle-like 
device called a pintle to inject 
propellant to the combustion 
chamber. 
According to Tom Mueller, 
SpaceX propulsion chief, it’s 
cheaper than typical rocket 
engines, which use a spray 
instead, and also less likely 
to cause explosions or other 
combustion-related accidents. 
The company also developed 
its own reusable, cost-effective 
heat shield technology, PICA-
X, with help from NASA.
PICA-X, Merlin engines, 
and every other component 
of the Falcon rockets are 
designed to be as durable as 
possible to withstand reuse for 
trips back to Earth, journeys to 
the moon, and travel beyond. 
Musk’s ultimate goal is to use 
his rockets to settle humans 
on Mars by 2030. This will 
only be a possibilty with quick 
innovation.Qingyi Dong/Staff Artist

Synthetic nanoparticles achieve complexity level of proteins
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon University showed that 
nanoparticles can achieve 
similar complexity to that 
of protein molecules. This 
potentially opens the window 
to the production of more 
robust medical drugs, 
computer processor chips, 
and materials. Rongchao 
Jin, a chemistry professor, 
conducted the study in 
his lab where the complex 
nanoparticle structures 
were made. Nanoparticles 
are one to one hundred 
nanometers in size and can 
be manually ordered to create 
molecule-sized structures 
such as incredibly thin 
tubes. In nanotechnology, 
a nanoparticle is de?ned 
as a group of particles that 
behaves as a unit in terms of 
its transport and properties. 
Researchers noticed self-
forming patterns in some 
nanoparticles made from 
Au-133 and Au-246 — gold 
isotopes. The experimentation 
thus aimed to discover 
the cause of these speci?c 
patterns, especially those that 
resemble natural patterns.
The study revealed that 
the nanoparticles bond by 
maximizing interactions 
between atoms. The particles 
then match to others with 
symmetric crystal surface 
patterns. This process repeats 
until a high-complexity 
structure is formed — one that 
resembles the complexity of 
protein molecules.
Nanoparticles have several 
uses. They can be used for drug 
and gene delivery systems, 
tissue engineering, detection 
of proteins, probing of DNA 
structure, and the creation of 
?uorescent biological labels 
in disease research. One use 
of nanoparticles that excited 
researchers most is in targeted 
treatment of diseases. By 
ordering a speci?c matrix of 
nanoparticle structure, drug 
manufacturers could create 
drugs that are less destructive 
to healthy tissue and reduce 
side effects, yet attack toxic 
cells and viruses more effec-
tively.
The study was funded 
by the Air Force Of?ce of 
Scienti?c Research and the 
Camille Dreyfus Teacher-
Scholar Awards Program. 
Other authors of the study 
include Carnegie Mellon 
graduate student Yuxiang 
Chen, University of Toledo’s 
Kristin Kirschbaum, and Kelly 
J. Lambright.

Women’s Basketball
A 22-point fourth quarter 
helped the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team ral-
ly from a seven-point de?cit 
to top Case Western Reserve 
University (CRWU) 72–65 in 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) road actions Saturday 
afternoon.
In the win, senior center 
and forward Lisa Murphy 
tied the UAA record for re-
bounds with 24 and set a new 
offensive rebounding record 
with 12.
The Tartans ?nished the 
season 18–7 overall and 7–7 in 
the UAA.
Murphy’s record rebound-
ing afternoon included 34 
points, 12 of which she scored 
in the fourth quarter during 
the Tartans’ rally. The senior 
?nished the afternoon mak-
ing 13 of 15 from the ?eld and 
8 of 10 from the free throw 
line to ?nish the UAA season 
with a record 77.2 percent ef-
fort from the ?eld in the 14 
league games. Joining Mur-
phy in double ?gures for the 
day was a pair of ?rst-years 
with 11 points each; forward 
Katharine Higgins and guard 
Makayla Filiere.
The Tartans held a 16–12 
lead at the end of the ?rst 
quarter after scoring the last 
?ve in the ?nal 18 seconds on 
a baseline jumper by ?rst-year 
guard Dominique Petach and 
a three-pointer by Filiere at 
the buzzer. The Tartans spread 
the ball around assisting on 
six of their seven baskets and 
did work on the glass hauling 
down 15 boards to eight for 
CWRU. Murphy led with 10 
rebounds.
The Spartans took back the 
lead 21–20 with a jumper and 
a three-pointer on the next 
possessions, closing a 9–0 run 
for the home team and giving 
CWRU their largest lead of the 
game at 24–20 with 4:15 to 
play in the half.
The Tartans tied it at 24–24 
with a string of free throws, 
but CWRU answered with a 
shot from behind the arc and 
led by ?ve before Filiere hit 
a jumper to cut the de?cit to 
33–30 heading into the locker 
room.
The Spartans made 5 of 
11 from long range in the sec-
ond quarter and eight for the 
half while the Tartans cooled 
down from the ?eld in the sec-
ond quarter to ?nish the half 
shooting 37.5 percent com-
pared to 43.8 percent through 
the ?rst 10 minutes.
A 10–2 run by the Spartans 
to open the third quarter 
pushed the home team’s lead 
to 43–32 with 2:11 gone by. 
An 8–1 run sparked by se-
nior guard Jackie Hudepohl’s 
three-pointer pulled the 
Tartans within three, 46–43, 
but another three-pointer was 
the answer for the Spartans.
The Spartans held the lead 
until 3:19 to go in the game 
when Murphy put in her 10th 
point of the quarter to give 
Carnegie Mellon a 64–63 
lead. After a Spartans layup, 
Murphy scored again to give 
the Tartans the lead for good 
as they hit 6 of 8 from the free 
throw line in the last minute to 
earn the comeback win.
The Tartans cruised to a 
54–26 dominance on the glass 
which included 18 on the of-
fensive end for 23 second-
chance points.
The Tartans also ?nished 
the game shooting 40.7 per-
cent to 36.4 percent for the 
Spartans.
The Tartans’ postseason 
fate is now in the hands of 
the NCAA selection commit-
tee as they’ll wait to see if they 
receive an at-large bid for the 
second straight season. The 
announcement will be made 
Monday afternoon.
Men’s Basketball
A 23–12 game-closing 
run by the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team led the 
Tartans to a 79–69 victory at 
CWRU on Saturday evening to 
?nish out the season. Senior 
forward Jack Serbin led the 
Tartans, now 14–11 overall 
and 8–6 in the UAA, with 28 
points and 19 rebounds. The 
Spartans ?nished the year at 
8–17 overall and 3–11 in the 
UAA.
Joining Serbin in double 
digits for the Tartans were 
senior center Chris Shkil and 
junior guard Ryan Maha with 
12 points apiece. Serbin also 
led the team in assists with 
four while Maha and ?rst-
year guard Colin McNeil each 
dished out three assists.
Serbin had the hot hand 
early for the Tartans making 
5 of 7 from the ?eld to tie the 
game at 18–18 with just less 
than 10 minutes to play in the 
half. After the Spartans had 
a 10–2 run, the Tartans an-
swered to take their ?rst lead 
since the 12:48 mark, 30–28, 
behind eight points from 
Serbin.
The teams traded baskets 
for the ?nal four minutes with 
a Spartans three-pointer at the 
buzzer, giving CWRU a 36–34 
advantage at the break.
Serbin led all scorers with 
19 points at halftime on 8 of 
12 shooting from the ?eld, as 
the Tartans shot 42.4 percent 
and the Spartans 37.1 percent.
The second half was an-
other back-and-forth affair 
until ?rst-year David Huber 
drained a three-pointer to give 
the Tartans a 59–57 lead with 
8:57 to go. Huber knocked 
down another trey on the next 
possession for the Tartans, 
who held the lead the rest of 
the way, pushing it to as many 
as 12 on back-to-back layups 
by Shkil with 2:36 to go.
The Tartans were even bet-
ter from the ?eld in the second 
half, making 14 of 28, to ?nish 
the game shooting 45.9 per-
cent.
The three-point arc was 
huge for the Tartans in the sec-
ond frame, as the Cardinal and 
Gray made 5 of 9 from long 
range to ?nish with six made 
for the game.

Jameis Winston reignites concerns over sexist remarks
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
Last Wednesday, Feb. 22, 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers quar-
terback Jameis Winston vis-
ited a class of elementary 
school students in the Tampa 
Bay area to give a speech with 
the intention of lifting up and 
encouraging the younger gen-
eration, a common way many 
local athletes give back to the 
community during the off-
season. However, this photo-
op quickly turned into a PR 
nightmare as Winston pro-
ceeded to put his foot in his 
mouth.
When the students ap-
peared inattentive and bored, 
he tried to rile up the students, 
but apparently forgot that the 
group included girls, saying, 
according to the Tampa Bay 
Times:
“All my young boys, stand 
up. The ladies, sit down,” he 
said. “But all my boys, stand 
up. We strong, right? We 
strong! We strong, right? All 
my boys, tell me one time: I 
can do anything I put my mind 
to. Now a lot of boys aren’t 
supposed to be soft-spoken. 
You know what I’m saying? 
One day, y’all are going to 
have a very deep voice like 
this. One day, you’ll have a 
very, very deep voice.
“But the ladies, they’re 
supposed to be silent, polite, 
gentle. My men, my men [are] 
supposed to be strong. I want 
y’all to tell me what the third 
rule of life is: I can do anything 
I put my mind to. Scream it!”
The franchise quarterback 
of an NFL team did indeed tell 
a group of third- through ?fth-
graders that boys are to be 
strong, with very deep voices, 
and girls are to be silent, po-
lite, and gentle, to sit down 
and sit pretty. Immediately 
Winston’s comments were 
slammed, widely covered by 
The Huf?ngton Post, The New 
York Post, and The Washington 
Post, with many people re-
sponding. Winston later clari-
?ed his statements, saying he 
was trying to motivate a young 
male student in the audience 
but used “poor word choice.”
Winston has worked hard 
to mend his image since his 
college days at Florida State 
University. An alleged rape 
case involving Winston from 
Dec. 7, 2012 was reopened 
in Nov. 2013. Despite this, he 
went on to win the Heisman 
Trophy a month later. The 
two federal lawsuits with the 
woman who accused him of 
rape were not settled until 
Dec. 2016.
Other controversies in-
cluded stealing crab legs and 
making obscene comments, 
the latter of which led to a 
half game suspension. Still, he 
was drafted ?rst overall by the 
Buccaneers in the 2015 NFL 
Draft. Since then, Winston has 
managed to avoid controver-
sies, and this past season led 
the team to its ?rst winning 
season since 2010.
Though he may have had 
good intentions, Winston’s 
recent sexist comments have 
only reinvigorated questions 
about his character that had 
quieted down for nearly two 
years. There is no problem 
with encouraging boys, but 
why exclude girls? Why not 
ask both boys and girls to stand 
up, to be strong, to speak out? 
The fact that a popular, public 
?gure, one many kids in the 
Tampa Bay area look up to, is 
sending this message is trou-
bling.
Winston neglected his re-
sponsibility to the community 
and forgot his place, one that 
has power and in?uence. Or 
perhaps he wholeheartedly 
believes that women are to 
simply be displayed like a vase 
of ?owers and ordered around 
like maids. That is even more 
disturbing.
However, no matter how 
wrong his comments were, it 
is not Winston who is the root 
of the problem. He is simply a 
result of a society that cages 
women to these expectations 
and social norms of submis-
sion, inequality, and silence. 
Winston is a man who lives in 
a society, our society, in which 
some people believe that 
women are lesser and weaker. 
Sexism is not one man — it is 
an institution that will not go 
away by simply denouncing 
him. It is something both men 
and women have combated 
for centuries, from women’s 
suffrage in 1920 to the recent 
Women’s March.
Women are strong. Women 
are not required to be polite 
or gentle, nor to stand aside 
and allow the next generation 
of men and women to believe 
the sentiments Winston ex-
pressed. Women will not be 
silent.

Tartans ?nd success at UAA Indoor Track Championships
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s track and ?eld 
teams took part in the 2017 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) Indoor Track and Field 
Championships on Saturday 
and Sunday. The Tartan men 
?nished in ?rst place and 
claimed their second ever 
UAA championship, while the 
women ?nished in ?fth.
The teams competed 
against Brandeis University, 
Case Western Reserve Univer-
sity, Emory University, New 
York University, the University 
of Chicago, and Washington 
University in St. Louis. The 
competition was hosted at 
Brandeis University.
The men’s team led the 
pack after the ?rst day of com-
petition with 39.33 points.
Junior Jacob Schofel was 
crowned the UAA Champion 
in the weight throw with a toss 
of 15.59 meters. Sophomore 
Kenny Sladick placed second 
in the weight throw after re-
cording a career-best toss of 
15.30 meters.

On buying sensitive items
Dear Shanley,
Hello. I am writing because I realized that I am 
not what one would call a social butterfly. In fact, 
I would call myself a social caterpillar still in its 
cocoon. But anyway, I noticed today that they were 
selling, uh, condoms at Entropy+. And as a person 
who would like to get more involved in this type 
of lifestyle, I thought that maybe I would need 
condoms in case I ever met a fancy lady at a party. 
However, the condoms … er… “those products” 
in Entropy+ are located BEHIND the counter. So 
does that mean I have to ask the cashier to get me 
the condoms? I would hate for the cashier to give 
me weird looks. What would happen if one of my 
friends saw me? I would be humiliated! I could 
never have friends again. My reputation would be 
shattered into little bits and pieces. 
Anyway, my question is how do I properly ask the 
cashier at Entropy+ to get the condoms for me? 
Should I be formal about the conversation? Should 
I act cool about the situation? I am just such an 
awkward lad, I hoped you would understand. I am 
just trying to stay calm about the situation…
Sincerely,
Slightly Horny Youth
Dear SHY,
Hey! I hope that you are doing well in what I

out and meet new people everyday, because they 
will be there to support you when times are tough! 
But anyway, after reading about your situation at

you think that buying condoms is a huge and

Walking into the newest special exhibition at the 
Andy Warhol Museum, painted by artist Firelei 
Baez and titled Bloodlines, is like walking into a 
magical garden. Gorgeous, powerful women gaze 
out at the viewer from every wall, surrounded by 
intricate textures and floral designs. Contrary to 
what a lot of people think of when they hear the 
words “contemporary art,” the show is accessible, 
pulling the viewer in with delicate flowers, fine hair 
textures, and curvaceous female forms running 
throughout the work in rich, dramatic colors. A wall 
stretching the length of the gallery was painted a 
soft blue and completely covered in floral medal-
lions and elaborate patterns, and my first thought 
upon seeing it was, “I wish this was what my room 
looked like.” The show is running through May 21, 
and is worth seeing even if just for the aesthetics.
But after the initial wave of wonder at the beauty 
of the space, the viewer begins to notice the com-
plexity of the work. The woman brought to life in 
vivid reds with the stunningly beautiful headdress is 
actually wearing a tignon, a head covering required 
for free women of color in antebellum Louisiana to 
make them less attractive to white men. The women 
forced to wear tignons threw the attempted mark 
of inferiority back in the face of their oppressors 
and turned them into a fashion statement. The flo-
ral medallions on the installation contain the Black 
Panther symbol and the Black Power fist. Running 
throughout the whole exhibit is a complex interplay 
of symbols of race, repression, and resistance. Born 
to Haitian and Dominican parents, Baez creates 
work that references the complexities of cultural 
diaspora from both a personal and global perspec-
tive but is ultimately an exquisite celebration of 
beauty in history and the individual.
Baez is a Dominican woman based in New York. 
Bloodlines is her first solo show and is an impres-
sive discussion of womanhood, globalism, and 
\nemnkZemkZ]bmbhgl':m_bklm%;Z^sliZbgmbg`l%pbma
their emphasis on laborious detail and personal 
honesty, may seem like an odd choice for the 
Warhol. Warhol, with his quick and relatively easy 
screen prints and affectless persona, seems at odds 
with Baez. However, both artists work with cultural 
b\hgl'CnlmZl:g]rPZkahelphkdpZlZieZr_ne
commentary on commercial icons, working with the 
construction of what defines an American identity, 
Baez works with the narrative of history of woman 
of color. The way we — immigrants, refugees, or 
people in countries who have experienced recent 
changes in political structure — understand history is 
blurry and incomplete. We understand it through an 
amalgamation of material cultural, aesthetics, and 
key stories.
Rather than in screenprints and photography, the 
media that brought fame to Warhol, Baez uses 
more traditional materials. Her exhibit consists of 
enormous paintings with the most delicate, precise 
brushwork. The use of acrylic, ink, and yupa paper 
in large scale gives the work a sense of nostalgia 
and of love and care that allows you to feel the art-
ist infusing herself into the narrative 
One of the most interesting things about the show 
is the way Baez uses repeated symbols and motifs 
to build meaning. The floral motifs on the walls 
appear in some of her paintings. Indigo and china 
patterns, colonial era crafts that came with famine 
and exploitation, bubble up in different parts of the 
room. And everywhere, there are references to tex-
tiles from different cultures.
M^qmbe^lZ^lma^mb\lZk^bgm^k^lmbg`_hkZgnf[^kh_
reasons. Primarily, textiles evoke a sense of body 
and the history of women. They allude to complex 
stories of cultural exchange and oppression, which 
the audience and even the subject does not fully 
understand because of the scale and subjectivity of 
these narratives. For example, the painting of the 
tignon explores a complex relationship with the tex-
tile, painting the tignon in beautiful, rich patterns but 
also making it dominate the painting, simplifying the 
wearer to bright colors and removing all her facial 
features but her eyes, which stare emotively at the 
viewer, full of power. The Japanese brush paint-
ing and Indian block print patterns that reappear 
in multiple works reference not only the cultures 
they come from but also the commercializations of 
their aesthetics. The viewer is asked to consider the 
textiles involved in conventional, Western stores. 
Clothes and textiles are tools of oppression and 
empowerment — they are ways of controlling how 
others see you. They capture the social expecta-
tions of the time, but in every painting the woman is 
made the subject of an image to tell her own story.

narrative, it brings power to the women by placing 
control of the narrative in their presence.
Another repeated motif in the exhibit is, clearly, the 
female body and hair. They are used as symbolic 
tools to primarily to discuss gender and race. Her 
work references laws surrounding natural hair and 
the Brown Paper Bag Test — laws devised to define 
and control race in Caribbean society — challenging 
the viewer to categorize the multicultural, uncatego-
rizable women and before them, but it also alludes 
to legends and imagery from both Caribbean and 
western culture involving women as seductresses or

ful textures of hair or fur in tiny brush work breaks 
away from classic Rubenesque figures, intended for 
aesthetics and titillation. Her figures claim their pres-
ence in a style of art that recalls anthropological 
drawing. They hold their own, forcing the viewer to 
see them as individuals and not ephemeral sexual 
objects or a stand-in for a larger culture.
Perhaps, though, the most impactful motif in the 
show is the grounding of the work in portraiture. 
The eyes, the body forms, and the references to 
real world people and objects all make it so that the 
work is about people rather than general concepts. 
For centuries, artists have used eyes as a way of 
drawing the reader into a more psychological paint-
ing, and reading into their expression allows one to 
dghpma^ZkmblmZg]ma^bkln[c^\m'Ma^^r^lbg;Z^sl
work reflect power and pride. Self-portraiture is an 
element that Baez often comes back to in her work. 
This is such an important part of her work because 
vague references to historical narratives and aes-
ma^mb\mkZ]bmbhglhgma^bkhpgZk^gm^ghn`amh\hg-
nect with an audience, most of whom are likely not 
from the cultures being discussed. Because the self-
portraiture allows her to lay claim to part of these 
stories, to say this is where she belongs and a part 
of who she is, we get a heightened level of intimacy 
with her work that makes it tenfold more impactful. It 
implies meaning beyond textiles, war, and colonial-
ism — it gives us a peek into her own story and the 
love she gives to her subject matter.
The sensuality of form combined with the seriousness 
of subject matter in the show creates layers of stories 
that are difficult to untangle. The flowing forms from 
the acrylics and ink serve to further blur (literally 
and metaphorically) the intention of the symbolism 
bg;Z^slphkd'Bme^Zo^lnlpbmaZjn^lmbhg3Pa^k^
does her work fall in the world of activism and resis-
tance? Artistic traditions tell us that there is power 
in representation — the Chicana art movement, for 
instance, worked with imagery of religion, woman-
hood, and industrialization to discuss social injus-
mb\^l%[nmpaZmi^kaZilblfhlmihp^k_nebg;Z^sl
work is that, in obfuscating meaning and central 
references through contradictions in symbolism and 
layers of narrative, it suggests there is power in mov-
ing beyond identity politics. That there is something 
universal about working to unravel who we are and 
where we come from, and that in moving beyond 
the hard lines of identity beyond easy communica-
tion we can share something more intimate and real.

music, you can come back to a song time and 
again and learn something new every couple 
of times. You start out soaking in the general 
vibe of the song, letting your fingers groove – 
not quite dance – just groove with the song. 
Ma^g^qmmabg`rhndghp%rhnk^ib\dbg`hnm
the complex arrangements, trying to make 
sense of what instruments make these unusual 
sounds. And the lyrics, once you finally get to 
them, are nothing short of poetry. So find a 
comfy place to sit and really listen, put on a 
pair of nice headphones, close your eyes, and 
start your journey with these five gems:
“High Hopes” by Pink Floyd:
Released by Pink Floyd as part of their 1994 
album, The Division Bell, “High Hopes” is one 
of the bands underrated gems. In spite of, or 
perhaps because it never received the same 
name recognition as “Time” or “Shine on You 
Crazy Diamond,” it is my opinion that “High 
Hopes” is definitely one of their most interest-
ing, if not one of their greatest, ever.

hgma^[Zg]l^Zker]Zrl%Zg]ma^l^^]lh_
discord planted between lead vocalist Roger 
Waters and guitarist Dave Gilmour following 
the demise of their legendary early bassist 
Syd Barret. The most distinctive feature of 
“Hopes” is the three-and-a-half-minute slide 
guitar solo that makes an appearance halfway

@befhnkl`nbmZkl^^flmhiZkmma^\ehn]lh_
conflict brewing throughout the song – an 
exclamation of pure, unadulterated indulgence 
that perfectly contrasts the constrained stiff-
ness up until that point. Organized and pure, 
yet angry and tense, this song is what the 
soundtrack to an army of marching angels 
might be like.
“Reverie” by Illenium:
MkZ\dgnf[^k_hnkh__h_+)*/lAshes, 
“Reverie” is the rare song that can complete-
ly indulge its genre stereotypes while sound-

Ma^lhg`aZl^o^krbg`k^]b^gmrhn]^qi^\m
in a deep house/melodic bass song – the 
smooth, heavily reverbed female vocals, the 
atmospheric arrangements, and of course, a 
anfhg`hnl]khi':g]r^m%ma^k^llhf^mabg`
about the way these seemingly familiar ingre-
dients come together that make this song 
much more meaningful than your average 
rave playlist track. What is it that makes this 
song special? Is it the way the eastern sound-
ing synth melody dances over a mountain of 
bass? Is it the keys and tribal drums that pre-
cede that massive drop? Or is it the simple, 
powerful lyrics that speak of overcoming 
hg^l_^ZklZg]Z[hnm\hfiZgbhglabi8Mabl
song has a way of seeming heavy and light, 
fun and heavy, all at the same time.
“Maula e Kull” by Abida Parveen:
Released last year as a part of Coke Studio 
Pakistan, Season 9, “Maula e Kull” is prayer in 
song form -- devotional and loving.
Even when there is no bass or rhythm, this is 
one of the most searingly powerful songs I have 
heard. What carries this song through is the 
voice of Abida Parveen, the queen of Sufi music. 
In South Asia, a voice like this will be described 
as “bulandh,” or incredibly majestic. Comparable 
to the greatest contralto singers, Parveen wields 
her voice like a weapon, forcing you to feel 
the emotion that she imbues each word with. 
Halfway through, the song turns on its head.
Transitioning from a heartfelt prayer into a rock 
ballad, “Maula e Kull” flaunts the deft chemistry 
between Parveen and her backup band, Strings. 
It is a testament to this chemistry that this sudden 
flip surprises the listener and yet retains the soul 
of a Sufi prayer.
For those not comfortable with Urdu, the YouTube 
video features an English translation, an English 
port of the Urdu words, and the native Urdu in 
which the song was written. Listen to this song 
and soar with Parveen, who is busy calling the 
voice, the name, the power, and the light that we 
are destined to follow, if unknowingly at times.
“Strobe” by Deadmau5:
“Dude, when I hear this song, I imagine the 
^g]h_Zpbe]gb`amhnm'Bml/Z'f'%mabg`lZk^
winding down, the sun is starting to rise, and 
this is the last song that comes on at the club.”
“Really? When I hear this I see the birth of 
the universe.” Most Deadmau5 fans will tell 
you that the day they heard “Strobe” is the 
day he went from being a fine DJ to a fine 
artist in their minds. I want to add to that: the 
fhk^Bo^a^Zk]mabl`^fh_Zlhg`ho^kma^
r^Zkl%ma^fhk^Bo^\hf^mhZiik^\bZm^bmZl
sheer genius. 
Ma^eZlmmkZ\dh__h_+)*)lFor Lack of a 
Better NameblZelhma^\hhe^lm'Ma^k^lZ
smoothness to it. A buildup so gradual and 
subtly interesting it captivates – which is amaz-
ing when one considers its all made from ana-
log synths. And when the drop comes, and it 
comes late, almost six minutes in, it feels like 
\ZmaZklbl%^o^gmahn`abmlk^ZeercnlmZlbfie^
4/4 if you think about it.

“Devi” by Parra for Cuva
Parra for Cuva has an uncanny knack for the 
]rgZfblfh_ZeZk`^^gl^f[e^%^o^gmahn`aa^l
just one guy. And nowhere is this clearer than 
in “Devi”, the opening track to his 2015 effort, 
Majouré. The song begins the entire record with 
the tinkling of a harp, followed by what sounds 
like pitch shifted water droplet samples, before 
gradually sliding permutations of cool, light lay-
ers on and off, always flirting with the idea of 
becoming a heavier song. It does get heavier, 
but not how you might expect. About halfway 
through the song, little-known rapper Nieve deliv-
ers one of the most unusual verses: his delivery is 
delicate and light-footed, but his lyrics are beauti-
fully layered. They almost beg to be pulled up 
Zg]k^Z]pbmama^lhg`'A^k^lZlZfie^3
“It was written in the starry sky
That the universe belongs to the starry eyed
Childlike is the mind, that be burning bright 
Still they label us naive and they wanna fight.”

DRY WEATHER
On Friday, Feb. 24,  sophomore  
humanities and the arts major 
Grace Huddleston and sophomore 
science and the arts major Becky 
Groves opened their exhibition 
Dry Weather at the Frame 
Gallery. According to their event 
description, Huddleston and 
Groves aim to use color as a way 
to invoke a sense of home and 
comfort. To that end, they hope 
to create a new environment of 
inclusivity rather than fighting for 
space in the current environment.
