IRC Delegates 
Attend Convention
The International Relations Club 
is sending three delegates to the
I.R.C. Annual Regional Conven­
tion at Vassar on November 30, 
and December 1. Clara Herron, 
Helen Keller, and Anita Newell 
will be the C.I.T: representatives.
The next I.R.C. meeting will be 
on December 4 at 4:30 p. m. in 
MMCC 102. The topic of discus­
sion will be “The United States in 
Germany.” Allan Bessemer, an 
English student at Tech, will lead 
the discussion.
There will be a dinner meeting 
of the club the second week in 
December. It will be held at the 
Carnegie Union, and everyone in­
terested in attending should con­
tact Don* Moore by December 6.
contact agencies immediately, but 
it is not expected that they will 
definitely know before January or 
February what bands will be 
available. If first choice Vaughn 
Monroe can not be obtained, the 
committee will work on second 
choice Tommy Dorsey and third 
choice Tex Beneke. The students’ 
preferences will be kept in mind 
in all negotiations.
The committee feels assured of 
satisfactory results. Agencies have 
been contacted at various times 
since mid-summer, and the bud­
get includes an appropriation of 
$3,500 for the formal dance.
The turnout for the vote was 
not as heavy as was expected, but 
Vaughn Monroe’s fans were there 
en masse. Trailing behind the top 
three were Elliott Lawrence, Har­
ry James, and Charley Spivak. 
Harry Truman was a poor tenth. 
The Boston Symphony won out 
over the New York, London, and 
Vienna Philharmonic by a narrow 
margin.
Bill Leroy Plays 
To Large Crowd 
At Pan-Hellenic
The Panhellenic council held 
the first semi-formal dance of the 
season last Saturday in Thistle 
hall. This closed affair drew a 
large crowd of gaily dressed girls 
showing the latest in fall formal 
wear, and many of the men wore 
their tuxedoes or tails.
Shortly after Bill LeRoy’s or­
chestra opened the evening’s en­
tertainment, it was announced, to 
everyone’s pleasant surprise, that 
there were gardenias for the girls 
and boutonnieres for their dates, 
as a gift of the Panhellenic coun­
cil.
The Black Cat lounge was open 
and the festive crowd moved back 
and forth from dance floor to 
lounge, from music and rhythm to 
cokes and potato-chips. Bill Le­
Roy’s music was designed for 
smooth dancing and pleasant lis­
tening, and kept thp colorful 
gowns swirling around Thistle 
hall.
The council had still another

Parks Receives 
Apell Scholarship 
For Drama Work
Robert Lee Parks, of Leechburg, 
Pennsylvania, senior in the De­
partment of Drama, is the winner 
of the Apell Memorial Scholar­
ship, which was presented at a 
ceremony in the Little Theater on 
Thursday, November 21. Norman 
J. Apell, of New York City, father 
of the late Sergeant Norman 
Apell, in whose memory the schol­
arship was established, made the 
presentation.
The Apell award is made on'the 
basis of scholarship, progress, per­
sonality, and general standing in 
the student body. The scholarship 
consists of a grant of $200, the 
income on the principal of a fund 
raised by friends of the late Ser­
geant Apell, Class of ’44-x, who 
died of wounds received in action 
in France in August 1944.
Parks, an outstanding student in 
the C.I.T. Drama Department, re­
turned from service last spring. 
He had been a roommate of Nor­
man Apell at Carnegie before the 
war and is currently playing the 
role of the Inquisitor in Bernard 
Shaw’s Saint Joan in the Little 
Theater. He is also production 
manager of WCIT, the campus ra­
dio station.
Parks is the second winner of 
the Apell award; the first was 
granted last year to Mary Laura 
Wood of Sackville, New Bruns­
wick, who is now in show business 
in England.
Three Art Students Awarded 
Prizes For Summer Activities
The Martin B. Leisser Prizes for 
Painting and Sculpture were 
awarded to three members of the 
department of painting and de­
sign at an assembly on Friday af­
ternoon, November 22, in the Ex­
hibition room of the Fine Arts’ 
building. An award of $40 was 
presented to one member of each 
of last year’s freshman, sopho­
more, and junior classes, respec­
tively, Andrew Wahola, Lee Kirk 
Watkins, and Martha S. Morrill.. 
Provost Elliot D. Smith made the 
awards.
Professor Wilfred A. Readio, 
who presided over the gathering 
of the entire student body of the 
department, spoke about the pur­
poses of the awards, presented at 
the discretion of the faculty. He 
stated that these awards are offer­
ed “to encourage personal and 
professional initiative, intelligent 
self-direction, and coherent self­
appraisal.” The students compet­
ing submitted written and visual 
material explaining the construc­
tive use and intelligent appraisal 
of their summer activity. This 
year’s winners told of work on an 
itinerant fruit-wagon, the com­
plete decorating and furnishing of 
an apartment, and work in an ad­
vertising agency.

Honoraries Call Pledges 
In Carnegie Day Events
The Carnegie day service, annual observance of the birth­
day of Andrew Carnegie by the students, administration, and 
faculty of Carnegie Tech, took place this morning in Carnegie 
Music Hall.
Following the processional played by Donald Wilkins, or­
ganist of the department of music, the invocation was pronounced 
by Rev. Hugh S. Clark of the Church of the Redeemer. The 
student symphony orchestra, conducted by Dr. Frederick Dorian,
played two selections.
by the Leisser Art Fund, estab­
lished at the request of Martin B. 
Leisser and his brother, Charles 
H. Leisser. Martin Leisser, a well- 
known Pittsburgh artist, was born 
in 1845. Leisser helped to persuade 
Andrew Carnegie that an art 
school should be added to his 
technical college, and he requested 
that his fortime should go toward 
furthering the arts. After he died 
in 1940, at the age of 95, the 
trustees of his fund decreed that 
prizes should be awarded at Tech, 
another part of the fund should 
go to the' Carnegie Institute for 
the purchase of pictures, and a 
third portion to the Art Society of 
Pittsburgh.
Dean Tarbell Dies
Arthur W. Tarbell, dean of men 
emeritus at the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, died Monday 
morning, November 25 in the Cape 
Cod hospital at Hyannis, Massa­
chusetts. He was 74.
Dean Tarbell retired July 1, 
1938, after thirty years of service 
for the school, the last nineteen in 
the capacity of dean of men.
Funeral services will be held 
Wednesday afternoon in Chatham, 
Massachusetts.
Carnival Stars 
Joey Simms
The winter social calendar will 
get under way on Saturday even­
ing, December 14, when the Win­
ter Carnival will be given in the 
men’s gym. The dance, the first 
all-school semi-formal of the year, 
will feature the musical stylings 
of Joey Simms, popular local band 
leader, and his orchestra.
Jean Streicher, dance chairman, 
announced that one of the most 
distinctive features of the dance 
will be the decorations, which, 
she promises, will be decidedly of 
an unusual and unique type. Dress 
for the dance will be semi-for­
mal in the traditional manner of 
affairs of this type.
Other members of the dance 
committee include: Dave Wallace, 
decorations chairman; Vance Se­
necal, publicity chairman; and 
Clara Herron, orchestra chairman.
Five Chosen For 
SAE Royal Court
Jo Klauss, Pat Johnston, Lin­
da Cowan, Sally Hutchinson, and 
Catherine Murphy were chosen 
by the student body to compose 
the Royal Court at the Corona­
tion Dance to be held at the 
Twentieth Century Club on De­
cember 7.
The election was a very close 
contest and the first campus elec­
tion to be covered by radio sta­
tion WCIT, which brought the 
listeners up-to-the-minute returns 
as the ballot counting progressed.
Eleven hundred votes were cast 
in the election, making it the larg­
est vote cast since before the 
war.
From the Royal Court one girl 
is to be chosen as Queen of the 
Freshman class by a group of 
faculty judges. The judges are 
Dr. and Mrs. Robert Gregg, Dr. 
and Mrs. Norman Dawes, and 
Mr. and Mrs. John Elliott. The 
final choice will be made at a 
dinner party to be given at the 
SAE fraternity on December 6. 
The announcement will be made 
on the night of the Coronation 
Dance.
Jimmy Kaye’s band has been 
engaged for the Coronation Dance 
and a formal coronation ceremony 
will be conducted.
Jo Klauss was sponsored by the 
Citcom Clan and comes from Alli­
son Park, Pennsylvania. She is 
taking costume design. Pat John­
ston, sponsored by Forbes hall, 
hails from Laurel, Montana, and 
is a General Science student. An­
other Citcom-sponsored candidate 
is Linda Cowan, from McKees­
port, Pa.; she is majoring in Sec­
retarial Studies. Linden hall’s 
candidate, Sally Hutchinson, from 
St. Petersburg, Florida, specializes 
in Home Economics. Catherine 
Murphy of Erie, Pennsylvania, is 
a Home Economics student, spon­
sored by Forbes hall.
The address was delivered by 
President Doherty, who spoke on 
“Where Are We Going?” and 
Frank E. Foote, newly-elected 
president of the Alumni Federa­
tion, brought greetings from the 
alumni.
At the conclusion of the speech­
es, scholastic awards were an­
nounced. Alpha Epsilon Phi sor­
ority was presented with the sor­
ority scholarship cup by Pres. Do­
herty; the women’s dormitory cup 
was awarded to Forbes hall.
Alpha Epsilon Phi leads the 
sororities with a factor of 2.95, 
followed by Delta Delta Delta 
with 2.70; Sigma Kappa, 2.61; 
Kappa Kappa Gamma, 2.59; Del-

Dec. Technical 
To Go On Sale 
Next Wednesday
The December issue of the Car­
negie Technical will be on sale in 
the entrance of Skibo on Wednes­
day, December 4. The price of a 
single copy will be twenty cents, 
with full year subscriptions still 
being available for one dollar.
This issue of the Technical, the 
first to be produced entirely by 
the new staff, will feature an ar­
ticle on city planning which will 
be of interest to both engineers 
and arts students inasmuch as this 
topic has become a subject of 
national interest within the past 
few years. Other articles of a gen­
eral nature, such as the discus­
sion of graduate studies written 
by Dr. Mavis, head of the depart­
ment of civil engineering, as well 
as highly technical papers such as 
the feature on servomechanism 
have been included.
Lopatnikoff Gets 
Radio Recognition
Invitation to Music, a late even­
ing radio program, will feature 
the “Second Piano Concerto” per­
formed by its composer, Nicolai 
Lopatnikoff, teacher of composi­
tion in the C.I.T. Music Depart­
ment, on Wednesday, November
27. Conducting will be Mr. Lo- 
patnikoff’s close friend, Nicolai 
Berezowsky.
The concerto was composed in 
»1930, and although this is the first 
American performance, it has been 
presented many times in Europe. 
One of the first performances was 
given at the International Society 
of Contemporary Musicians in 
Vienna in 1938.
Two CIT Students 
Given Art Prizes
Martha Morrill and Victor Full- 
man, two Carnegie Tech painting 
and design students, recently won 
awards in the 1946 Greensburg 
Art Club show, which is exhibited 
in the YMCA galleries in Greens­
burg. Miss Morrill, a senior art 
student, won first prize, the 
Charles McKenna Lynch award 
of $25, for her painting “Tables 
for the Ladies”; Fullman, a fresh­
man veteran, won third prize, the 
$15 Thomas Lynch award, for his 
painting “Rural Stop.”

Editor’s Armchair
The Tartan Policy
Where are “Skibo Scraps?” They are the only part of the 
Tartan anyone reads. Don’t you dare put “Skibo Scraps” back 
in. They’re childish . . . Casey’s column is a waste of space; 
Casey’s column is one of the best columns I’ve ever seen in a 
college newspaper . . . You’re not sticking enough to college 
news; you don’t cover world and national affairs enough . . . 
The paper is anti-fraternity; the paper is fraternity-controlled
... Why didn’t this story get in; who the ---------- is interested
in that story . . .
This is only a small cross-section of the contradictory com­
plaints which cross the editorial desk. There are lobbies for 
one thing and lobbies for another thing and nobody agrees on 
anything; No wonder editors go mad. So we will take this space 
to explain just where the Tartan stands this year.
Our Policy as a Newspaper
The Scottie is Carnegie Tech’s humor and gossip magazine; 
the Technical is its scholarly magazine; the Thistle is its year­
book ; and the Tartan is its newspaper.
And a NEWSPAPER is what we want it to be—not a gossip 
sheet or a fraternity organ. We are struggling to make the 
Carnegie Tartan a college paper that can stand side-by-side with 
any college newspaper in the country, even those which are 
published by journalism schools and liberal aits colleges.
Such a status may seem too personal and too indefinable; but, 
as a member of the American Collegiate Press, we receive each- 
year a rating in comparison to other college papers. To receive 
an award of merit from this critical survey is the highest honor 
any paper could achieve.
Although this motivation to our paper should explain its 
contents reasonably well we will also include controversial 
particulars.
“Skibo Scraps” has been dropped because we feel that it 
is silly, Scottie material, that it lowers the standard of the paper, 
and that we can scarcely give you a fair and representative 
cross-section of campus names and personalities. However, since 
we realize it is popular with some of you, we will condescend to 
include it in big dance issues WHEN THERE IS SPACE. News 
must come before features of any kind.
In answer to another issue: we have not discontinued the 
fraternity column, since it is of interest to a certain element of 
the student body. Nevertheless it wTill be limited to a minimum 
space, equal or nearly equal to that given the clubs and organi­
zations.
Our Policy on Current Events
The first factor, therefore, in editing the Tartan is to build 
it into a first-rate college newspaper. Closely related to this 
purpose is our desire to include world and national news as 
well as local events of interest. A college is not a world apart; 
a college student is not exempt from responsibilities of citizen­
ship.
In fact the way of the world today lies heavily in the 
hands of this very college student. To exclude current events 
from a school paper is to encourage the already highly forti­
fied college isolationism and to impede the education of stu- * 
dents as citizens. Already classrooms and books take up so 
much time that many haven’t the chance to inquire into the 
state of the world.
As a result the Tartan intends to include some coverage of 
current trends and events; however, due to an administrative 
policy, we will religiously avoid all local controversial issues.
Our Political Policy
A third and most important aim of the 1946-47 Carnegie 
Tartan is to be an unbiased, impartial, representative organ for 
the ENTIRE student body.
In political questions, it is our policy not to take a definite 
side but to give readers the facts on both sides so that they have 
a basis for forming an intelligent opinion.
We are not anti-fraternity; neither are we pro-fraternity. 
However, we are in favor of a school run by a fair and represen­
tative section of the student body.

The Passing Parade
By Carl Klahr
In the mountains there lives a 
wizard who is possessed of all 
secrets. One day while in a curi­
ous mood he picked up his tele­
scope and looked at the earth. 
What he saw amazed him. Mil­
lions of people, harried, worried, 
and unhappy were locked in strife 
with each other. “Ho,” he said, 
“I’ll help the pork jerks and in­
cidentally make a little profit.” So 
he wrote a book, The Keys, re­
vealing his secrets for the edifica­
tion of the earth people, and went 
down to sell it.
To sell his book the wizard 
made a little speech. He said, “It 
is every man’s birthright to have 
these things of life: Money! Good 
health! Happiness! If you lack 
any of these buy this book. It tells 
you the particular day or hour 
to do anything you desire, wheth­
er it be in the light of the moon, 
sun, or in total darkness.
“Well, come on now, are there 
any buyers? Maybe you want to 
make people do your bidding. It 
tells how here. Ring up a sale 
for Harry Truman. Maybe you 
want people to love you or are 
trying to avoid a law suit. John L. 
Lewis wants a copy. Maybe you 
would like to choose words ac­
cording to ancient holy methods. 
Give Henry Wallace, editor of The 
New Republic a copy. Yes, withal, 
business is brisk.”
At first people were rather 
skeptical, except for the publish­
ing firms, but as time went on
amyMt JomM
Saint Joan as a play lacks the 
integration, the all-p ervading 
mood which would carry its audi­
ence throughout its unusual length 
with unflagging attention. Its hu­
mourous moments, interspersed 
with scenes of gripping tragedy, 
convey the impression of disjoint­
edness rather than pleasant comic 
relief, and interludes like the riv­
er scene seem to add nothing but 
length to the play.
In leaving a performance one 
carries away memories of individ­
ual characters rather than ofjthe 
play as a whole, and it is fortu­
nate that in the drama depart­
ment’s current staging of Saint 
Joan there are enough outstand­
ing performances to make these 
memories lasting ones and the 
production a worthwhile addition 
to the department’s repertory. 
Title Roles Interpreted Differently
It was fascinating to watch the 
difference in interpretation of the 
title role as it was presented by 
Nancy Wickwire and Elly Hovde. 
Both, of course, saw Joan as a girl 
utterly convinced of her right­
eousness and ultimate success, and 
unable to understand how anyone 
could fail to appreciate and agree 
with a mission which to her is so 
simple and obvious.
But while Elly’s Maid is com­
pletely bewildered by this lack of 
immediate response, Joan as in­
terpreted by Nancy is mature 
enough to be self-assured and to 
scoff her critics. This makes her 
a dominating and aggressive per­
son, whose initially good-natured 
and pitying mockery gives way to 
a terrible anger as even those 
whom she has saved turn away 
from her. Forsaken, and on trial 
for her life, she is desperate be­
cause of what she considers the 
incomprehensible stupidity of her 
contemporaries.
Elly’s Joan, on the other hand, 
is a child trying to convince her 
supposedly superior elders of 
something, the truth of which, in 
her opinion, is unassailable. When 
she fails to do this, she is con­
fused, and gradually this bewil­
derment grows into a deep resent­
ment against those in whom she 
has placed her trust. She is brok­
en by their injustice, and it is 
only the final perfidy of the sen- 
tehce of life-long imprisonment
that jars her into the awareness 
of her own superiority. 
Supporting Cast Excellent
Mitch Agruss gave a superb 
performance as Cauchon, the fan­
atical exponent of the Church, and 
with the brilliant assistance of 
Carl Betz as Warwick made the 
tent scene by far the best in the 
play. The quality of Robert Parks’ 
acting, together with the richness 
and beauty of his voice, raised the 
Inquisitor’s long speech and his 
dominant position in the trial to 
one of the highlights of the eve­
ning, and Louis Edmonds stood 
out both as Dunois and Beaudri- 
court.
As the latter he was ably as­
sisted by Casey Stine’s Steward. 
William Ross, double cast as War­
wick, gave the best performance 
we have ever seen him do, and 
both George Wood and Bert Pol­
lock were excellent in their 
hilarious interpretation of the 
Dauphin.
The Keys brought results. The 
very same power which the an­
cient Chaldeans, Cuthics, and 
Egyptians had used was at the 
disposal of anyone who would 
take the trouble to cast a spell. 
Butter, hitherto unobtainable un­
der $1.30 a pound, would walk out 
of the warehouses at a beck and a 
nod. Whoever stroked his head 
six times could have a steak, and 
by pulling his left ear anyone 
could get a 50% pay raise, ac­
companied by a loving note from 
his employer. It was really won­
derful. The wizard puffed up his 
chest in pride.
President Truman, who had 
bought the first copy of The Keys 
was soon known as the most de­
cisive, forceful president since F.
D. Roosevelt. John L. Lewis, he of 
the bushy eyebrows, was so well 
loved by the public that he al­
most choked under the weight of 
letters wishing him well. And 
Hank Wallace was recognized as 
such a sincere, straight-thirling 
editor that he was called to head 
Fortune and True Story maga­
zine.
But there was a fly in the oint­
ment. What with the amazing 
standard of living people again 
become discontented. First capital 
went on strike because the mathe­
maticians wouldn’t allow more 
than a 100% profit on every sale. 
Then labor went on strike because 
their employers wouldn’t send 
them roses every morning. People 
began casting spells right and left 
at those whom they disliked. Con­
ditions became so bad that the 
government had to step in and 
establish the SCNB — Spell Cast­
ing Neutralization Board.
This brought down the house. 
“Another Federal Agency,” said 
the Republicans.
“The government is admitting 
immigrants and naturalizing them 
so they can compete against us 
for jobs,” said Labor. The Ku 
Klux Klan burned wax images of 
the Congressmen responsible for 
the “outrage,” giving them indi­
gestion.
The wizard watched all this in 
wordless astonishment. He couldn’t 
believe, even when he saw it, that 
humans would so pervert his gifts. 
But finally someone stuck pins 
into a wax figure of him, giving 
him a belly-ache. “Enough is too 
much!” he thundered, and cast a 
spell that charred every copy of 
The Keys to a crisp.
Back on the mountain top the 
wizard picked up his telescope, 
looked at the squabbles, the Wor­
ry, the misery on the earth, and 
laughed softly to himself.
Student Council
Sixth meeting 
November 22, 1946 
The meeting was called to or­
der at 5:00 p. m.

Gilbert and Sullivan Operetta
Undergraduate Essay Contest 
Will Award Fifty-Dollar Prize
The Pittsburgh Savoyards will 
open their ninth season with the 
Gilbert and Sulivan operetta, The 
Gondoliers, on Thursday, Novem­

the Carnegie Tech music depart­
ment, will sing the roles of the 
lovers, Casilda and Luis. Roger 
Ingham will play Guiseppe, one of 
the twin gondoliers. Emerick Sim- 
boli, well known for his portrayal 
of Koko in The Mikado and of 
John Wellington Wells in The
Sorcerer, will play the Duke of 
Plaza-Toro.
Two Tech music students, Jane 
Fisher Ginevan and Dorothy Hal- 
las, will sing the feminine leads.

Eleanor Helfrich 
Wins Position 
On Mademoiselle
Eleanor Helfrich, M.M.C.C. jun­
ior, is the first C.I.T. student to 
wi a position on the Mademoiselle 
College Board. As a member of 
this board she will submit four 
articles to Mademoiselle, as will 
other students throughout the 
country, and the twenty who com­
plete their assignments with the 
greatest amount of talent will be 
awarded guest editorships.
“The Kilties Are Coming” was 
the title of her prize-winning 
paper. It was on the Tech plaid 
fashion show which Horne’s put 
on in the Little Theater last 
month. Eleanor modeled in the 
show.
Eleanor is a transfer student 
from Mount Mercy college, and is 
now a junior majoring in costume 
economics. After graduation she 
will enter the fashion field and 
will probably specialize in dress 
designing.
Symposium Given 
On Foreign Policy
Three points of view on the 
subject of American foreign poli­
cy will be presented at a sym- 
[Continued on page 4]
The Division of Humanistic and 
Social Studies is sponsoring an 
essay contest for undergraduates 
in the College of Engineering. A 
fifty-dollar prize will be awarded 
to the author of the best essay 
dealing with a significant problem 
in the writer’s own community.
Although definite plans for the 
contest have not been formulated 
as yet, arrangements will be an­
nounced through the various de­
partments within a few weeks. 
All essays must be turned in to 
Professor R. D. Gregg not later 
than April 15, 1947, and the
awards will be announced May 1, 
1947.
A committee of staff members of 
the Division and of the College 
of Engineering will serve as 
judges. The essays will be judged 
primarily upon the soundness and 
clarity of the analysis and the 
realistic understanding of both 
the origin and nature of the prob­
lem and possible solutions.
In the preparation of the essay, 
careful attention should be given 
to the following: clear statement 
of the problem, presentation of 
evidence to show that the prob­
lem exists and data relating to its 
analysis and solution, analysis 
of data, presentation of a suggest­
ed solution, and suggestions for 
putting the solution into effect
within the community.
Length of the essay is to be de­
termined by what the contestant 
believes is necessary to present 
the problem, related data, and 
suggestions for solution.
The first contest was held in 
1944 when Frederick A. Faville 
and George Ellerton, Mechanical 
Engineering graduates, class of 
1919, established a new fund, 
The Alumni Fund for Greater In­
terest in Government. Mr. Faville 
has for years been interested in 
the trends in governmental affairs 
and has devoted a iarge part of 
his time to encouraging alumni to 
take a more intelligent and active 
interest as well as a more definite 
part in the affairs of government.
In 1943 he conceived the idea 
that one way to win alumni sup­
port would be to encourage their 
interest before they became alum­
ni. With this in mind, he and his 
business partner George Ellerton, 
Jr., established the Alumni Fund 
for Greater Interest in Govern­
ment as a permanent part of the 
endowment fund of Carnegie In­
stitute of Technology.
The income will be allocated to 
the Division of Humanistic and 
Social Studies and used to en­
courage more interest in govern­
mental affairs among the under­
graduates of the College of Engi­
neering and Science.

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1046
On Fraternity Row
The Beta Sigs followed the Jun­
ior Prom with a breakfast which 
was very well attended. A1 Leh­
man acted as host and entertain­
ed with his unique pantomime, 
set to Beatrice Kay’s Oceana Roll.
If eager, but rundown, Phi 
Kaps continue losing in intra­
mural volleyball, they feel that 
a challenge from eager, built-up 
Whitfield hall would not go un­
answered—provided that the Kaps 
get good odds.
Pipe-loving Phi Kap pledge Jim 
Campbell feels that a chunk of 
briar is part of his face. Delta 
Gams must have got it over­
heated at the recent tea dance.
Kermit Lundall joined the 
ranks of proud fathers on Novem­
ber 3, when his wife gave birth 
to a daughter. DU’s are still look­
ing for the cigars.
Tri-Delts were guests of the 
TX’s at a tea dance and buffet 
supper on Thursday. Tall, quiet 
Johnny Wordeman was the hit of 
the day.
ATO held a breakfast after the 
Junior Prom — so did the TX’s, 
Tau Delts, and Delts. Seems that 
everyone took advantage of the 
relaxation of rules which IF 
managed to gain.
The ATO’s think that they have 
a potential league-leader in their 
volleyball team, which took its 
opener handily.

Mr. Christenson moved that the 
minutes for the special meeting 
of Student Council held on No­
vember 13 be approved, with the 
exception of the Kappa Sigma pe­
tition which is still under discus­
sion.
Motion carried.
Miss Emmel reported that the 
public address system, which is 
jointly owned by Day and Even­
ing Student Council, is in need 
of a number of repairs. She sug­
gested that the system be re­
paired and then put into the hands 
of Mr. Miller for storage. Any or­
ganization desiring to use it could 
do so by petitioning either the 
Day or Evening Student Councils 
for its use.
NEW BUSINESS:
The next Student Council meet- 
will be held on December 3.
Mr. Richard Teller, represent­
ing the Men’s Glee club requested 
that an additional sum be added 
to their budget to enable the Glee 
club to add to the music library. 
Mr. Engle moved that Council 
approve this request.
Motion carried.

Pittsburgh Chapter, and is open 
to the public. No tickets of ad­

Dr. Albert B. Martin, assistant

the University of Pittsburgh, will 
take the stand that “we must be 
firm in the interests of national 
security and the United Nations.” 
Verne Wright, associate professor 
of sociology at Pitt, will urge 
“more cooperation with the Soviet 
Union,” and Robert Tilove, mem­
ber of the Planning committee of 
Americans United for World 
Government, will present the 
point of view that “our only hope 
is in rapidly building limited 
world government.”

Glum TX’s are plotting to blow 
up the Tau Delt house in reprisal 
for the Tau Delts spoiling their 
undefeated season in touch foot­

The SAE’s really miss “Aunt 
Helen”, their house mother. She is 
in West Penn Hospital recovering 
from an operation.
Basketball-totin’ Bob Ferguson, 
has donned the blue pledge pin of 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon.
Seen at the PiKA breakfast fol­
lowing the Junior Prom was R. E. 
Alexander, looking quite happy 
with lovely Ann Wehn. Everyone 
missed flu-stricken Ed Clark.
An enjoyable time was had by 
all of the Sigma Kaps on their re­
cent hayride which took them to 
Rose Grove at North Park. High­
light of the evening was the 
square dancing, which, although 
no one knew exactly what to do, 
proved highly entertaining.
The sororities have been taking 
turns in entertaining each other’s 
pledges. The Kappa pledges were 
hostesses at the Union on Tues­
day. Sigma Kaps gave a “Gobble- 
Gab” on Wednesday and the Tri- 
Delts finished up the week’s ac­
tivities at the Black Cat on Fri­
day afternoon with another “hen” 
party.
Three sororities celebrated 
Founder’s Day this week. The 
College club was the scene of the 
banquet held by the Tri Delt 
Tech chapter, Pitt chapter, and 
the Pittsburgh Alliance on Tues­
day. Wednesday night the Sigma 
Kaps celebrated their birthday, 
after their regular meeting. 
AEPhi’s commemorated the third 
anniversary of their chapter with 
a dinner at the Ruskin Apart­
ments on Thursday evening. The 
Thetas and the Delta Gammas 
each entertained fraternities this 
past Thursday; lucky boys were 
the Delts and Phi Kaps, respec­
tively.
Editorial
[Continued from, page 2]
As products of democratic 
idealism, we are anxious to see 
democracy succeed somewhere— 
even at CIT. Perhaps this is sheer 
mad foolishness. To be entirely 
unprejudiced and perfectly fair 
is a human impossibility. We 
know it. But we can try, can’t we?
As for the Tartan itself, many 
of you have accused us of being 
dominated by this or that fraterni­
ty. This accusation may be true 
to some extent but only because 
it is these people who come up 
and work.
Positions on the Tartan are free 
to anyone who has the interest to 
work hard and the ability to work 
well. More than any other type of 
publication, a newspaper staff, to 
assure complete and accurate 
news coverage, must be impar­
tial and representative.
After all this is a school paper 
and we fail only as you fail. Our 
reporters cannot know of ALL the 
news; so if you discover a story 
that should be published, tell us 
about it. If you have gripes to be 
aired, points of view to be ex­
pressed, or another side of a con­
troversy to be presented, write us 
a letter—but sign it, please.
This is your newspaper. It 
should be your mouthpiece and 
include your stories.

In the short time he has been 
at Tech, Dick Storm has shown 
more school spirit than the aver­
age Engineering student would 
show in nine lives. I guess this is 
why Dick, alias Richard Guay 
(that’s very French) Storm has so 
often been referred to as the “En­
gineer with a dramat complex.” 
Dick received his B.A. at Ken­
yon in March of ’43, did metallur­
gical work for two years before 
deciding to come to Tech last fall. 
At present he is an advanced sen­
ior in the department of Metallur­
gical engineering. During his year 
at Carnegie he has become the man 
that everybody knows through his 
various activities, including chair­
manship of the Bridge tourna­
ment, Call Day, and Dorm Coun­
cil dance; vice-president of Delta 
Skull; member of Student Coun­
cil, ODK, ASM, AIME, and Metals 
club; and finally as spectator at all 
soccer games. (Heckman please 
note.)
Dick is perturbed over a num­
ber of situations which exist on 
campus at the present time. He 
can’t understand why Tech stu­
dents do not turn out for foot­
ball and soccer games in greater 
numbers. According to Dick, Ken­
yon with its three hundred stu­
dents had more spirit than Tech

with three thousand odd. Student 
Council is next on his peeve list 
The power politics exerted by said 
body have led him to announce 
his intention to resign.
Storm is an avid sportsman as 
well as a sports fan, hunting, fish­
ing, and track being listed as his 
favorite participating sports, while
other sports such as soccer, bas­
ketball and football rate a specta­
tor role. Music also has a place 
in his interests. Again “our” man 
is not sitting in the background, 
he plays the violin.
And in his off-campus moments 
(God love them) he quite often 
is accompanied by such notables 
as Heckman, Maley, and House to 
the Grecian Room of the Swine­
herd’s Hotel—to you less delicate 
individuals, “The Greeks”—“And 
here with Calm outside and Storm 
within the mighty four eat pretzels 
with a beverage.” (Well, it’ll get 
past the censors.)
Arrive as we must at the ques­
tion of the opposite sex we find 
our hero firmly declaring that “he 
loves them all”—as if it isn’t ob­
vious. Room-mate Dick Heckman 
keeps insisting there is a picture 
on his desk, but this suggestion 
was quickly denied. In taking 
leave of this subject may I quote 
a famous Storm phrase “anyone 
not talking of sex is changing the 
subject.”
And in taking leave of one of 
the boys may I say he smokes 
Camels.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 26, 1946THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5
Orchids and Andylines
By Andy Cantini
Hand me my mourning face, Jeeves, I’m out to celebrate the 
end of Tech’s football season. Gad! what a letdown. In a few short 
years we’ve dropped faster and farther than a V-2 dud. Don’t 
get me wrong; I’m not blaming the players or the coaches. The boys 
just didn’t have the experience and ability to match their opponents, 
and the coaches didn’t have much to work with. We don’t expect a 
national champion, but we would like to see Tech field a team that 
can at least hold its own against these minor colleges. The least 
said about this season the better, but when looking into the future 
how’s about loosening up on the purse strings a bit, eh Doc?
> ATTENTION MR. RISEDORPH: I suggest that you devise a
Tartans End Scoreless Season9 
Fall Victim to Grove City, 20-0
Skibos Have Perfect Record, Win 0, Tie 0, Score 0, in Six Contests; 
Offense Better in Final Game, Threatens Twice, Reaches 9-Yard Line
Grove City, Pa., Nov. 23—Grove City College turned back 
an invading Tartan eleven 20-0 to give the Grovers tneir first 
victory over the visitors since 1909 in the final game of Tech’s 
“pointless” season. It was the Skibo’s best game statistically. 
They piled up 11 first downs and came within 9 yards of pay 
dirt.
Tech held the Grovers even for the first half and twice dur­
ing the contest unloosed potential scoring threats. In the third 
period Pinky Stewart broke away on a reverse for 40 yards only
system in the way of a question­
naire or test in selecting the of- 
cials for the intramural contests. 
The umpires during the softball 
season were atrocious, but the 
football referees were even worse.
A game that is designed to be rel­
atively clean is turning out to be 
one of those “knock-’em-down- 
and-drag-’em-out” affairs. In a 
recent game we saw more tackles 
made than thé whole Tech line 
has made all year. This type of 
play may be very enjoyable for 
the spectators, but one of these 
days some poor sucker is going 
to come up with a serious injury, 
and I needn’t tell you where the 
blame will eventually end.
Poor officiating not only de­
stroys the spirit of the game, but 
tends to create ill feeling between 
the competing groups. We don’t 
expect professional referees; but 
we do expect officials who know a 
little about the game and its rules 
of conduct.
Cohen Cite&
Each week, this corner will 
name a Tech student or alumnus 
who has been especially outstand­
ing in the realm of sports. My 
nomination for this week is Sher­
man Cohen of the Tau Delta Phi 
intramural football team. This 
passing genius has been the main 
cog in the elevating of the Tau 
Delt team from a mediocre one to 
the leading contender for the in­
tramural crown. So a bouquet of 
orchids to Sherman.
Along this time of the year ev­
erybody and his brother takes a 
crack at selecting an All-Amerir 
can team. After much squabble 
within the sports staff of this peas­
ant version of a newspaper, we 
have come to the following de­
cision:
At left end, Hank Folberg of 
Army, a demon on the defense and 
a stellar pass receiver. Left tackle, 
George Savitsky of Penn, an im­
movable block of muscle. Left 
guard, Alex Agase, Illinois, the big 
reason of the Illini’s bid to the 
Rose Bowl. Center, big George 
Strohemeyer of Notre Dame, an 
outstanding lineman in an out­
standing line. Right guard, Mike 
Djmitro of U.C.L.A. Mike was 
yours truly’s teammate in high 
school at Weirton, West (By God) 
Virginia a few years back. He was 
All-State material then, so now 
he must be All-American. Right 
tackle, Oeorge Connor of Notre 
Dame, a must on anybody’s selec­
tion. Right end, Bechtol of Texas, 
a worthy repeater from last year’s 
nominations.
The backfield is the easiest to 
select. Glen Davis of Army and 
Charlie Trippi of Georgia take 
over the halfback posts without a 
question. Felix Blanchard, the Mr. 
Inside of Army, is unanimous at 
fullback and Notre Dame’s bril­
liant field general, Johnny Lu- 
jack, rounds up an invincible 
combination.
In the words of Omar Khayam, 
“The moving hand writes and 
having writ moves on”—and the 
moving hand is tired of moving. 
But don’t worry, kiddies, for, as 
General MacArthur said, “I shall 
return!”

Intramural. 
Roundup
The score sheets were piled a 
foot high in the intramural office 
as the final football games com­
bined with the beginning of bowl­
ing, volley ball, and table tennis 
to make it a full week of ath­
letic activity.
Last night’s game between the 
Tau Delts and the Delts was the 
climax of the 1946 intramural 
touch football season. This battle, 
waged after the paper went to 
press, decided whether the Tau 
Delts will meet the Pitt winner 
on December 5, or if the Delts, 
Tau Delts, and T. X.’s will have 
to have another play-off round. 
Tau Delts In Play-offs
For the third consecutive time 
the Tau Delts have come up to 
cop the Team-of-the-week award 
—this time for a pair of brilliant 
victories. Breaking a tie in the 
final quarter, the Tau Delts clip­
ped the PiKA’s 17-12 to win the 
American League Championship 
and then went on to down the 
undefeated T. X.’s in the play-offs 
18-7.
The Delts repeated over the 
Sigma Nu’s 25-13 to clinch the 
Federal League, but lost their 
first play-off game to the T. X.’s
12-15. Elmer Kaelin saved the 
day for the T. X.’s by snagging a 
pass in the end zone in the final 
quarter to climax a second half 
drive to overcome a 10-1 Delt 
lead.
Though the campus champ has 
not been crowned as the paper 
goes to press, the final standings 
of the three leagues are complete.

The Beta’s captured two games, 
beating the D. U.’s 21-6, 21-12 and 
the Delineators 21-2, 21-2. The 
Kilroy A. C. also won a pair by

Tech Nosed Out 
In A.M.A. Meet
After a week of fighting exams 
at Carnegie, the cross-country 
team on Saturday fought the ele­
ments of weather and a large field 
of runners representing several 
schools and athletic clubs from 
the western end of Pennsylvania. 
In the annual cross-country meet 
of the Allegheny Mountain Asso­
ciation of the A. A. U., Tech came 
in third.
The meet was won by a club 
representing Aliquippa and com­
posed of several stars from that 
district. Tech was nosed out of 
second place by one point by our 
old rival, Pitt. (It’s a college 
. . . ) The score of the meet was 
Aliquippa 37, Pitt 43, and Tech 
44.
Beamer Finishes Second
Sudzina of Pitt was the indi­
vidual winner of the meet. He 
was closely followed by our own 
Jackrabbit, Bill Beamer. Bill’s 
time of 23:29 was the best ever 
made on the Schenley courts by 
a Carnegie runner. The Skibo 
runners all bettered their times 
by approximately a minute.
The Carnegie men finished as 
follows:
Beamer, second 23:29
Ropzler, eighth 25:20
Davies, ninth 25:25
Cockrell, eleventh 25:45_
Childs, fourteenth 26:10
Pitt took the first, fourth, sev­
enth, fifteenth, and sixteenth.
This meet closes one of the most 
successful seasons ever enjoyed 
by any Tech cross-country team.
Kiski Takes J. Y. 13-6
The Carnegie JV’s closed their 
twot-game season last Tuesday 
when they were beaten by the 
Kiski Preps 13-6. The lone Tar­
tan touchdown came early in the 
second half when they took the 
ball on their own twenty-eight 
line and marched to the Kiski 
eighteen where a pass from Maley 
carried Dickson into the end zone.
Although first downs were nine 
to five in favor of the JV’s, two 
passes for the visitors found their 
marks for two touchdowns and 
the margin of victory.
12, 21-17, and the Kappa Sigs over 
the Sigma Nu 21-19, 21-3.
Table Tennis Started
The singles and doubles com­
petition for the table tennis 
crowns*are in the first round, while 
eight teams saw action in the 
league races. The Delts downed 
the Kappa Sigs 4-1 at the Delt 
House, Fran Clark was extended 
to three games to take Jim Taylor, 
the top man for Kappa Sig. The
F. P. H. A.—2 squad captured 
three out of four singles to de­
feat the Beta Sigs.
The S. A. E.’s needed only three 
men to trim the Dorm Combine
— 2 as Alexander, Evans, and 
Duroux won their matches easily. 
The fourth game went to the A. 
T. O.’s, who took two singles and 
the doubles to down the Delt—2. 
Bowlers Take To the Lanes
Saturday afternoon at the Craig 
Street alleys saw sixteen teams 
clash in the opening of the bowl­
ing leagues. The three game win­
ners were the A. T. O.’s, PiKA’s, 
and the Dorm Combine who out- 
rolled the F. P. H. A., Combine— 
3, and the A. S. C. E., respectively.
The Delt-2 took two out of 
three from the Sigma Nu’s; the 
Kappa Sigs did the same to the 
Delt-3, as did the Phi Kaps to the 
T. X.’s, the T. N. T’s to Citcom, 
and the Beta Sigs to the Splits.
Star-of-the-day award goes to 
the Dorm Combine’s Ernie Snoy- 
er. Snoyer had the three game 
high with 565 and the single game 
high with 210. The only other 
man to break 200 was Klein with 
201. [Continued on page 8]
Booters Win, 1-0 
Even Record 4-4
Grove City, Pa., Nov. 22—An 
underdog Tartan soccer team scor­
ed a 1-0 upset over a confident 
Grove City eleven on a cold w*indy 
field today before a few scattered 
fans.
The Tech booters entered the 
fracas with a 3-4 record, while 
the Grovers had only been beaten 
once during their entire season. 
This was an avenging game, for 
last year Grove City upset an un­
beaten and untied Skibo team 4-3 
in the final clash of the season.
The Tartans, at full strength 
with the return of Williams, Mc­
Gee, and De Moraes to the lineup, 
outplayed the Grovers in the slow 
first period mostly because of the 
wind at their backs. After they 
had felt out each other’s strength, 
the tempo of the game was speed­
ed up, and Grove City took over 
the offensive.
Captain Mellott Tallies 
Just before halftime, the Tar­
tans broke through the Grover 
defense to score the lone and de­
ciding tally of the game. Kroko 
booted the ball in front of the 
Grove City goal where Williams 
passed it to Captain Mellott, who 
pivoted and kicked past three de­
fenders into the left-hand corner 
of the goal. The period ended with 
the Tartans trying to score again 
but the Grove City defense tight­
ened up and refused to be pene­
trated.
Both sides had opportunities in 
the third stanza, but neither team 
was able to sneak the ball through 
the goalposts. The Grovers vainly 
tried to deadlock the contest as 
the Skibos were determined to 
win their final game and even 
their season record at 4-4. The 
stout Tartan defense was impreg­
nable, as they turned back one 
rush after another. Accurate cor­
ner kicks by the Grovers tossed 
many a scare into the Tartans 
during the waning minutes of the 
game.
Dorf Stars In Goal
Marty Dorf?*Tech’s goalkeeper, 
was the real hero of the game. 
Had it not been for his smart and 
alert playing, the Grove City boot­
ers might have pulled the game 
out of the fire.
For McMullan, King, Marmo, 
.Heckman, Quail, Kindbloom, Herz, 
and Captain Mellott it was the 
final game for the old alma mater, 
as all are seniors or juniors who 
expect to graduate before the next 
soccer season rolls around.
Coach O’Connor tossed a little 
farewell beer party for the team 
in the cellar of the Delta Tau Del­
ta house — even food could be 
had for those who desired to eat. 
Climaxing the get-together, Mc­
Gee and Williams were elected co­
captains for the 1947 season.
to trip on the Grovers 29.
The first quarter featured an 
exchange of punts and ended with 
Grove City starting a march to­
ward the Tartan goal. With the 
ball on the Tartan 18, Hummel 
fumbled and Highberger recov­
ered for the Skibos on the 7.
Tech Drives 84 Yards
Tech then began their drive-of- 
the-season which carried them to 
the Grove City 9 before they were 
stopped. The spectacular play 
which climaxed this drive was a 
pass from Maley to Wolfarth, who 
lateraled to Donohu«.
The clock saved the Skibos in 
the second quarter as the half 
ended with the Grovers whipping 
a forty-yard pass that carried 
them to within ten yards of the 
double stripe.
A pass interception set the stage 
for the home team’s first score. 
With he ball resting on their 
own 46 the Grovers marched all 
the way to the Tech goal with 
Shankle carrying the ball on eight 
out of ten plays and finally buck­
ing over from the one foot mark. 
Smith tacked on the extra point 
Steward Goes 40 Yards
It was right after the kick-off 
that Stewart broke loose for his 
forty yard sprint to the Grover 29. 
Tech’s attack slowed soon after­
wards and the home team went on 
to score two more times oefore the 
final whistle. Shankle plunged 
over from the five after a pass 
from Smith to Hamilton put the 
Grovers deep in Tartan territory. 
The final touchdown followed an 
interception on the Tech 32 by 
Kelly. Hummel took it to the ten, 
and Whitehall carried it the rest 
of the distance. Smith again tack­
ed on the extra point to bring 
the final score to read 20-0.

The Cross-Section
It’s Our World
The student Federalists held 
their convention on the campus 
of the Chicago institute to decide 
what the attitude of their organ­
ization would be towards the pro­
posed world federation.
It is the plan of this group of 
; tudent leaders to support the 
Jnited Nations as the primary ex­
isting international organization 
which is attempting to achieve 
some of the aims of world gov­
ernment, and to support all pro­
posals which embody the minimum 
essentials of federal world gov­
ernment.
They take particular pride in 
the fact that “S. F. is different 
from a lot of youth organizations 
because it is not a front for adults, 
nor for communists either, to put 
it bluntly.” It is their hope that 
all similar world government or­
ganizations will go into action in 
time to hit the 1948 elections.
New ’Scope Is Boon To Research 
The Daily Texan reports that 
they have on their campus an 
electron microscope which can 
magnify up to 600,000 times. This 
will enable scientists to view for 
the first time particles of butter- 
fat, carbon black, and the elu­
sive cancer virus.
The heart of the scope is a 
cylindrical chamber the size of a 
fluorescent lamp globe. The elec­
tron gun at the top of the cham­
ber fires electrons at extremely 
high velocities right through the 
specimen.
Molecules of the substance be­
ing studied deflect the electrons 
that strike them. Those that miss 
the speciment fall on a fluorescent 
screen where they outline the 
specimen’s structure. Plans are 
now being outlined for extensive- 
use of this device in all fields of 
research.
AA Union For College Students
In an attempt to analyze the 
plight of the college student, the 
editors of Ring-Tum Phi came 
to the conclusion that it is “a good 
thing that college students don’t 
belong to labor unions.” They
Tech Fund Drive 
Goes Over Quota
Carnegie Tech is over its quo­
ta in the Community Fund Cam­
paign which ended today.
In the last week of the cam­
paign, students donated $50.00 
while the faculty added $42.00. 
T total amount collected reach-
e< -850 02, which was $250 over
t ; e $4600 quota.
Kent D. Sehaffer, chairman of 
the Tech drive, stated, “Both the 
students and faculty should be 
congratulated for their coopera­
tion in this campaign.”
point out that one of the avowed 
purposes of unions is to provide 
shorter working days and thereby 
secure more time for recreation.
The facts are as follows: There 
are 168 hours in the week. The 
average student spends 15 hours 
in class, 3Vz hours in lab, 30 
hours studying for regular assign­
ments, 7 hours for extra work, 4 
hours for tests, 4 hours for parallel 
reading, 10 hours eating, 7 hours 
dressing, IV2 hours at church, 7 
hours for exercise, 7 hours going 
to and from school and classes, 7 
hours for meetings and 63 hours 
for sleep. This makes a grand to­
tal of 166 hours. This leaves 2 
hours for recreation. It’s a good 
thing that college students don’t 
belong to labor unions!
World Student Congress Success
The representative from the 
University of Texas at the student 
organization reported that the 
conference held in Prague last 
month paved the way for further 
cooperation among the college stu­
dents of the world. Its purpose 
was to discuss methods by which 
students could work together to 
insure sound educational policies 
throughout the world and how 
they could work towards fostering 
international student exchanges 
in order to provide relief for the 
universities devastated by the war. 
Its aim was to set up a strong 
student organization, through 
which students could [unite to 
keep the peace.
In its meetings every three 
years the congress will decide on 
the policies to be followed and 
will then meet only often enough
Yets May Use 
Bonds for NSLI
The Veterans’ Administration 
has announced that special forms 
are available at all VA offices for 
use of ex-servicemen who wish to 
apply their accrued leave bonds 
toward payment on National Serv­
ice Life or Government Insur­
ance.
The Armed Forces Leave Act of 
1946 specifically provides that 
these bonds can be accepted by 
the VA for the following: to pay 
premiums on insurance already in 
force, to purchase new insurance, 
to reinstate elapsed policies, to 
pay the amount required when 
converting term insurance to per­
manent forms, or to repay policy 
loans made prior to July 31, 1946.
When a bond is used for insur­
ance payments, it must be as­
signed in its entirety. Any bal­
ance may be used for payment of 
future premiums, or on request 
will be held until maturity date, 
at which time it will be refunded 
without interest. %

Of Life Insurance
Much red tape has been elimin­
ated by a new, simplified form for 
veterans’ applications for educa­
tion and training benefits under 
the G. I. Bill. The application and 
certificate are now combined in 
one form, eliminating the paper 
work and the waste of time in the 
old system.
The Veterans Administration 
reminds those who have National 
Service Life Insurance that the 
Insurance Act of 1946 has opened 
a large field of new settlement 
options, ranging from lump sum 
payments to monthly installments. 
The main advantage of the new 
settlement provisions is that vet­
erans can now select a combina­
tion of payments; they can speci­
fy that a certain amount be paid 
at the time of their death and the 
remainder in monthly installments.

Sorority Members 
Requested For 
Evening Society
Although an encouraging num­
ber of replies have been received 
from girls who are interested in 
the sorority for evening students, 
we feel there are many who have 
wanted to take part in the organ­
ization who have just overlooked 
or prolonged letting us hear from 
them.
Perhaps some who are reading 
this column are just a bit in the 
“fog” as to what we are referring, 
so no doubt an explanation is 
necessary. Several weeks ago, an 
article was printed in THE 
PLAID asking for names of those 
interested in becoming charter 
members of Tech’s first evening 
school social sorority. As we said 
before, a great deal of work will 
be involved in organizing and 
furthering the sorority, but the 
final organization’s functionings 
will be more than worth the time 
spent in the beginning.
The girls who have replied rep­
resent members of varied classes 
at Tech, and their homes range 
far and wide over the Pittsburgh 
district. They all have expressed 
an enthusiasm for participation 
and membership in the organiza­
tion. All have volunteered their 
willingness to help in whatever 
way they can, and it is hoped that 
we shall soon be able to call upon 
them for their aid. It is really 
pleasant to read of their acknowl­
edgement of the idea, and need­
less to say, is appreciated.
Again we ask for those who 
are interested to send their name, 
address, and phone number (home 
and business) to Can egie Insti­
tute of Technology, Box 256, 
Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.
DramaDepartment
To prove their versatility, the 
Tech Dramats have chosen George 
Ade’s “The College Widow” for 
their next theater production. 
From advance information, we 
understand it is to be a pleasant 
comedy that will be “easy to 
take.” Although the exact date has 
not yet been set, it will be prob­
ably sometime in December.
The students at Tech can be 
thankful that they have the op­
portunity of witnessing fine the­
ater here on campus. The stu­
dent actors and actresses chosen 
for each part employ all the en­
thusiasm and talent necessary to 
make each - production an enter­
taining showpiece.

Thanksgiving Dance

active part of the sweet, smooth music that will be heard coming 
from Thistle Hall on the night of November 30.
Our gala Thanksgiving Dance is but a week away and already 
it promises to launch our social season off with a bang! The members 
of the social committee who have been selling tickets at various places 
around campus report that the tickets are selling very well and 
promise us a gay
crowd for that eve­
ning. If you haven’t 
seen any of the 
members of the 
committee, be on 
the lookout for 
them as they will 
be ready and will­
ing to sell you as 
many tickets as you 
may need. While 
this dance is spon­
sored by the Eve­
ning School Coun­
cil, it is not restrict­
ed to students at- 
tending Tech.
Therefore, any 
friends you wish to 
bring along will be 
welcome and may 
enjoy the popular 
renditions by Don 
Palmer, his orches­
tra, and the “Mel­
low Modes.”
To fit the spirit 
of Thanksgiving,
Thistle Hall will be 
decorated with the 
traditional Thanks­
giving turkeys ajid 
corn stalks. Tables 
arranged in the in­
timate cabaret style 
will be the setting 
for this affair.

will be open for refreshments 
and as a place to chat with your 
fellow students.

abouts. Starting at the front of the
