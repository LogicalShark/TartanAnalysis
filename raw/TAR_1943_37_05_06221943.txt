The Carnegie Tartan
T. X. To Sponsor 
Open-Air Dance
Scene: Thistle Hall.
Time: An evening in summer.
Setting: A dance.
The same old crowd of terp- 
sichorean extroverts are jumping 
up and down with their usual care­
free abandon. But something is lack­
ing. Every other chorus, couples 
stagger to a window, gasping for 
air, and try to remove the perspira­
tion which threatens to obscure their 
vision.
Reason: The heat.
Now that summer is here, danc­
ing has ceased to be shrouded in the 
storybook aura of romance. This­
tle Hall’s obvious lack of air con­
ditioning has removed many of the 
enjoyable qualities from Tech’s 
favorite pastime. Realizing the 
grave social problem which may re­
sult from the unfortunate effect of 
heat upon dancing (Department of 
Humanistic and Social Sciences 
please note), Pi Chapter of the The- 
ta Xi Fraternity has offered a solu­
tion.
The solution is constructed along 
the following recipe: Take one ten­
nis court. (The one behind Whit­
field Hall labeled with the sign, “For 
Women Only.”) Add one balmy 
summer evening. Toss in a few mis­
cellaneous stars and a moon. Sea­
son well with soft lights, the music 
of a fine orchestra, and the sooth­
ing fragrance of shrubbery. Stir 
well and the result becomes Theta 
Xi’s Summer Party.
This innovation will be held Sat­
urday evening, June 26, from nine 
until one. Since this solution to 
the heat problem is only an experi­
ment, Theta Xi is inviting the stu­
dent body to attend free of charge» 
Tickets for the dance may be ob­
tained by both civilian and ASTP 
students for themselves and the 
ladies by patiently plying Mrs. 
King in the Registrar’s office in Ad­
ministration Hall. The end of the 
line will be found approximately in 
front of the Beanery.

Attention !
In order to insure a future sec­
retary for AGAG, an election for an 
assistant secretary to attend meet­
ings as a non-voting- member will 
be held next Tuesday. Petitions 
for nomination, which are only 
open to Margaret Morrison junior 
secretaríais, must be turned in by 
this Thursday afternoon at 4:30.
At the meeting last Thursday, 
AGAG decided that to have an able 
secretary present at all meetings 
an assistant secretary should be 
chosen. Her duties will be to at­
tend meetings and enter into all 
discussions but she will have no 
vote. Nomination petitions must 
be signed by at least ten Margaret 
Morrison women.

ASTP Men Formerly 
In Diversified Fields
Among the Army students cur­
rently stationed at Carnegie are to 
be found men from all different 
walks of life.
Not only do the soldiers hail from 
every section of the country, from 
widely diversified financial and so­
cial surroundings, but the different 
occupations held by these men in 
civilian life represent almost every 
possible manner of earning a live­
lihood.
A great number of soldiers were 
clerks, office workers, and store­
keepers in civilian life. The type 
of occupation which claimed the 
greatest number, however, was that 
of skilled and unskilled shop labor. 
Over one hundred of the soldiers 
were formerly employed in these 
capacities by the heavy industries. 
They were mechanics, toolmakers, 
maintenance workers, and helpers.
Several soldiers were employed 
by the United States Government in 
civilian capacities before donning 
khaki. These men worked for Army 
Ordnance, Naval Supply depots, the 
CCC, the WPB, the Signal Corps, 
and the Bureau of Narcotics of the 
Treasury Department.
Other diverse occupations which 
our new students formerly held are 
those of embalmer, photographer, 
diamond cutter, forest ranger, re­
porter, and musician. Two were en­
gaged in radio work, one as an an­
nouncer, the other as a manager of 
a radio station in Phoenix, Arizona. 
Three were chemists or laboratory 
technicians, and one soldier was the 
manager of a newspaper.
Of the four-hundred-odd soldiers 
at Tech over two hundred attended 
college, three of them being former 
civilian students here at Carnegie. 
Others studied at Purdue, Georgia

Robert Gill, Director of Pittsburgh Playhouse for the summer season
Robert Gill, Drama ’33, To Direct 
Summer Theater At Playhouse
One of the most popular and best- 
liked members of Carnegie Tech’s 
Drama School faculty is young, per­
sonable Robert Stanton Gill. A Tech 
product, Gill graduated from the 
Drama Department in 1933, and 
came back in 1939 to produce a Ra­
cine tragedy for his Master’s De­
gree. His most treasured memor­
ies of Tech are associated with his 
work with B. Iden Payne, former 
director of the Shakespeare Theatre 
at Stratford-on-Avon. Returning 
again this fall as an instructor in 
the department, he directed Pride 
and Prejudice and Moor Born.
This summer he is director for 
the Pittsburgh Playhouse, which 
opens a ten-week summer season 
July 5 with Penny Wise by Jean 
Ferguson Black. Several of his Tech 
students are working with him at 
the Playhouse. Jenny Lou Law, who 
graduated in May, is stage mana-
jßieutenant Ament
The seventeenth gold star has just 
been added to the Carnegie service 
flag, with the tragic death of Naval 
Lieutenant Donald Clark Ament. 
Lieutenant Ament’s death occurred 
June 17, when his self-built sailboat 
capsized in the Allegheny River. 
His companion, Edwin Tillotson, was 
rescued.
A graduate of the College of En­
gineering as a metallurgist in 1941, 
Ament enlisted in the Navy in 1942 
and was commissioned an Ensign. 
He was transferred here as an in­
spector in the Naval Materials Of­
fice, and was advanced in rank, first 
to Lieutenant Junior Grade, and 
then to Lieutenant.
While a student at Tech, Ament 
was a member of the A. S. M., the 
A. I. M. M. E., and the Delta Tau 
Delta Fraternity. Since he was in­
terested in athletics, he was also a 
member of the Varsity Hockey team.
Lieutenant Ament was the son of 
Mr. and Mrs. Walter E. Ament, 416 
Bucknell St Besides his parents, he

ger; Jeanne Burke is prop mistress; 
and Priscilla Dodge is appearing in 
the first production. The Playhouse 
also hopes to have Elise Cox there 
this summer. Selected so far for 
the summer program are A Murder 
Has Been Arranged by Emilyn Wil­
liams, Old Acquaintance by John 
Van Druten, George and Margaret 
by Gilbert Savory as well as the 
opening play Penny Wise. Mr. Gill 
likes heavy drama which he is un­
able to include in this season’s 
repertoire as light comedies and 
mysteries are standard summer 
fare.
This season at the Playhouse has 
not been his first experience with 
summer stock. In 1939 he was the 
leading man at the Point Chautau­
qua Playhouse in New York; in 1940 
he directed the Fox Chapel Play­
house; and in 1941 was with the 
Playhouse at Madison, Ohio.
After he graduated from Tech, 
Gill worked with the George Sharp 
Company at the Hotel Fort Pitt 
Playhouse where he did the villains 
in Why Girls Leave Home and The 
Drunkard. In 1939 he stage direct­
ed Tales of Hoffman for the Pitts­
burgh Opera Society. For the next 
two years he worked at the Cleve­
land Playhouse on a Rockefeller 
Fellowship. Two of his favorite 
roles at this time were the Bund 
leader in Margin For Error and the 
Nazi agent in Flight to the West. 
Last year he appeared with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony as narrator 
for the Story of Ferdinand which 
was given at a Pop Concert at Syria 
Mosque. Besides his varied theatre 
activities Gill has done radio work. 
He was staff announcer for WCAE 
for a year and assistant production 
head of WCAU in Philadelphia.
Mr. Gill feels that because so 
many people have to spend the hot 
summer months in town due to war 
work and the gas problem, all or­
ganizations such as the Playhouse 
should be kept going. He added that 
anyone who is interested in doing 
theatre work this summer is wel­
come to come down for an audition.

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JUNE 22, 1943
POLITICAL DEMOCRACY
The Editors of the Carnegie Tartan feel that it is an editorial duty to 
express the views on postwar planning that are now being formulated. 
This is done in the hope that student thinking will be directed toward the 
world of reconstruction. We are anxious to have the ideaS of students and 
faculty members, and, if possible, leaders in national thinking. Herewith 
is presented a paper by Dr. Chapman, which has aroused the interest of 
those who have read it, and we believe to be significant in the light of the 
growing strength of our own national government.
Political Democracy
Stuart W. Chapman
Our discussion today on The Regeneration of Democracy has its origin 
in some ideas suggested at the last meeting of the Faculty Discussion 
Group which considered the subject of Postwar Problems. Two of those 
ideas were as follows: (1) that we can expect a greater degree of govern­
mental control of our postwar economy than we have ever known in the 
past; (2) that, if strong central government and Fascism are synonymous, 
we are almost bound, therefore, to lose the peace even though we win the 
war.
These thoughts raise the question as to whether one of the major prob­
lems of postwar planning may not be the attitude with which we approach 
the political aspects of the world after the war. Are we going to cripple 
our efforts at planning because we assume that strong central government 
is tantamount to the very Nazism and Fascism we are striving to destroy? 
This is the problem I shall consider, especially as it concerns domestic 
situations.
At the outset I make three assertions: (1) strong central government, 
even dictatorship, is not necessarily synonymous with Nazism and Fascism; 
(2) we need to change some traditional attitudes toward democratic gov­
ernment; (3) unless we do adopt some new attitudes we are very likely to 
fall victim to Fascism here at home.
Strong central government is not synonymous with Fascism. Fascism 
and democracy are more than mere forms of government. They are funda­
mental philosophies of government and of life which set up goals for a 
society and imply methods of achieving them. Fascism is a complex thing. 
It rests upon a belief in authority and obedience to authority rather than 
upon freedom as the basis for social organization; its goal is power, and 
power which is morally self-justifying; it exploits the basest traits of hu­
man nature as a means of achieving its aims. Fascism asserts the su­
premacy of the State over the individual to the extent that the individual 
attains his highest possibilities through the subjection of his own desires to 
the dictates of the State. And that State is given almost an organic ex­
istence as the embodiment of a chosen group, either nation or fictitious race, 
whose mission is the complete domination and exploitation of inferior 
peoples. Indeed, the theory of the chosen people is carried even further 
and is applied within the bounds of the nation or “race” to establish the 
rightful existence of a natural elite whose duty and prerogative are ruler- 
ship. Fascism, although it may seem at times to be working toward world 
organization, is really building an organization consisting of dominant and 
subject peoples. Finally, Fascism is fundamentally anti-scientific. It is true 
that it uses the scientist and the sciences to achieve its goals, but the sci­
entific attitude of mind is foreign to it. Its every assumption of the nat­
ural superiority of a group, whether it be national, “racial,” political, eco­
nomic, or something else, rests upon no scientific foundation. Membership 
in the “elite” arises not from provable fact but from feeling. One knows he 
belongs there because his “blood” tells him so. This is mysticism.
It would be a palpable absurdity to contend that every strong cen­
tral government must be dominated by these ideals of Fascism. Not every 
dictatorship need be dominated by them. In these days we are perhaps be­
coming conscious of the fact that there are important differences between 
the ideals of Communist and Fascist dictatorships. The degree of strength

in a government is far from being an adequate measure of the degree oi 
Fascism to be found therein.
I conclude, therefore, that if we wish to avoid Fascism in our own post­
war society, we need to shun not strong central government as such, but 
any government, local, state, or national which is based upon Fascist ideals. 
Escape from such a danger can be guarded best by the avoidance of action 
dominated by Fascist ideals in our private and public lives—in our homes, 
in our classrooms, at the polling place, and in any position of responsibil­
ity involving other persons.
My second assertion is that we need to change some of our tradition­
al attitudes toward democratic government. Early democracy arose at a 
time when governments were absolute or extremely strong and were con­
trolled by small special interested groups. The natural goal of leaders of 
democratic thought was, therefore, to restrict governmental activity as the 
prime prerequisite for gaining individual freedom. The growing middle 
class was especially prominent in the movement to tie the hands of govern­
ment since much of the political activity of absolutist regimes was directed 
toward regulation of economic life. The result of this early democratic 
movement was to create a body of opinion which regarded government in 
a negative way, as something to be feared and handcuffed whenever possi­
ble. That attitude is best summed up in the frequent statement that “that 
government is best which governs least.”
Our own democratic idealism in America has had within it much of 
this suspicion of government. We have been contemptuous of “realistic” 
politics, of politicians—almost of the very word “politics.” We have neglect­
ed government; we have too often failed to understand or appreciate its 
necessity and functions in any social order, and thus we have been reluct-* 
ant to see in it possibilities of positive good. The future will probably de­
mand that we change these attitudes and see government not merely as 
something to be feared and checked, but rather as an instrument of social 
organization which we can employ as a means of attaining the goals of 
a democratic society.
My third assertion is to the effect that we are very likely to develop a 
Fascist society if we do not change some of our attitudes toward govern­
ment. The problems of our times are so baffling, so complex and interrelat­
ed, that their solution seems to require planning by an over-all agency 
which can devise projects in broad terms of the nation and the world, 
which represents no one interest or small group of interest, and which has 
the authority and resouces to carry out its plans. Government alone seems 
to be such an agency. If we are not willing to use government as such a 
tool, then our problems are likely to grow worse and worse. Failure to solve 
them might well lead to the unemployment, insecurity, restlessness and dis­
satisfaction which are the breeding-ground of Fascism. Dictatorship in pol­
itics might seem then to be the only means of assuring a reasonable degree 
of stability and hope. In an America where the demoratic ideal is sttll 
strong and resistance to the idea of dictatorship also is strong, such a 
dictatorship would naturally arise from, and be run by, those persons in 
our own society to whom Fascism appeals as a way of thinking and a way 
of living.
Letters To The Editor
Dear (Mademosille) Ed
I am one of those “lucky” unex­
pedited students who finds herself 
in the happy situation of having no 
classes to attend these lazy June 
days. Nevertheless, my heart, as 
ever, is on the Campus, and so I 
felt that old familiar urge to put my 
foot in the Tartan pie and give you 
kind of an inside outsider’s impres­
sion of Carnegie Tech a la summer 
’43.
The campus has changed, out­
wardly, inwardly, and every-ward- 
ly. It’s not only that my dearly be­
loved Skibo is now a mass of cam­
ouflaged khaki brown catering sole­
ly to GI haircuts and soiled uni­
forms, though that in itself is 
enough to break the morale of any 
Techite who made her second home 
there for three years. It isn’t that 
the Beanery just ain’t no more, at 
least no more for us civilians. 
Imagine, no dramats lounging on 
the tables, no ice cream cones on 
the way from Maggie Murph to In­
dustries, no more hot roast beef 
sandwiches to up my caloric intake, 
no more.
But don’t get the idea that I’m
griping, because if it came to a 
choice, I’d take the new order 10 
times out of 9. There may be a lot 
of the old tradition gone, but there’s 
a new spirit in the air, a new zest 
for living—a certain something that 
this campus has lacked ever since 
the bottom dropped out of Decem­
ber 7. I’ve seen it. I’ve talked to 
students who are effervescing with 
it, and believe me, for the first 
time in ages, I have seen Tech 
shaken from its lethargy. People are 
taking an interest in each other, in 
their classes, in the War. College 
has taken on a new meaning. Every­
one is going for a purpose; no more 
of that “school is just a place to go 
because it’s the thing to do” idea. 
The girls have a renewed interest 
in looking attractive for the men, 
or is it the ASTP influence? Blame 
it on “la guerre,” on the spring, on 
the victory in North Africa, or on 
the good old male versus female 
wolfing instinct, but things are 
looking up at Carnegie and that’s 
good.
Sincerely,
A rejuvenated winter coed

TUESDAY, JUNE 22,1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
one of the boys
. Al Sher
The water gurgled pleasantly dur­
ing the conversation, punctuating 
each sentence. Puffing away at a 
water pipe in true oriental style was 
A1 Sher, Tech’s symbol of industry. 
Did he steal a few minutes from the 
interview, say, to balance the ACAC 
budget? (He’s ACAC chairman). 
No* sir! A1 was busily reclining 
full length on the sofa, eyes on the 
ceiling, and surrounded by a halo 
of smoke. Now there is little extra­
curricular pie in which this engi­
neer doesn’t have a finger; Consul 
of Tau Delta Phi, ACAC representa­
tive, and Interfraternity Council 
member are only a few of his posi­
tions.
How come then all this leisure? 
Well, A1 knows how to relax and 
take time off to crack a joke. (His 
frat brothers will tell you he’ll 
match wits with anyone and have 
him in stitches in nothing flat). If 
it weren’t for his happy faculty of 
relaxing, A1 would probably buckle 
under the terrific strain of his work 
—even so he’s lucky if he sleeps six 
hours a night.
Just mention a particular activity, 
and the chances are that A1 is either 
engaged in it or will be when he 
finds time. He started his career by 
playing the clarinet in his own 
dance band at high school. From 
that he jumped to a pre-business 
course at the Ruth Junior College. 
He then came to Tech on a schol­
arship to take Plumbing, Heating 
and Air-Conditioning Engineering. 
Al will tell you that he wanted to 
go to the University of Minnesota 
but took the wrong train by mis­
take. (Don’t believe him!) Remark­
able for an engineer, he has a flair 
for dramatics, yet modestly states 
that he didn’t care to specialize in 
it, since eating was more important. 
If you’ve seen him in a frat play, 
wrench in hand, reporting to FDR, 
on plumbing conditions in Ethiopia, 
you’ll have no mean opinion of his 
talent.
Al’s life at Tech should really be 
taken year by year to give a com­
plete picture of all he has done:
As a freshman he was elected 
pledge president at Tau Delta Phi, 
worked for the Tartan, was bask­
etball manager, and went in for 
bowling, football, basketball, base­
ball and volleyball. (Five o’clock 
shadow .made its first shy appear­
ance.)
In his sophomore year he became 
a member of Interfraternity Coun­
cil and Scribe of the Tau Delts.
(Five o’clock shadow now appear­
ed at three).
While a Junior, he became assist­
ant treasurer and elections chair­
man of Student Council, Consul of
. . . ACAC Budget Chairman
Tau Delta Phi, and manager and 
first baseman of their intramural 
softball team. (Five o’clock shadow 
only waited till noon.)
As a Senior, he was elected cap­
tain of the Tau Delt’s baseball team, 
engineering representative and 
Budget Chairman of ACAC. (His 
five o’clock now sprouts forth at ten
a. m.)
A1 not only practices extra-cur­
ricular activities but he preaches 
them as well.
He’s urged the Tau Delts—and 
everyone else he knows—to do more 
than study, on the theory that 
studying is only a part of college 
life. Ask how many on the campus 
got their start from Al!
It’s mighty hard to find some­
thing that Al Sher doesn’t do and do 
well, but with all his work he’s 
found time to be a human being. 
People fascinate him: he can go to 
a carnival and have more fun 
watching the crowd than the show. 
As for his opinion of the other sex,

Executive Board Cancels 
Monday, July 5th, Holiday
At a recent meeting of the Execu­
tive Board, it was decided that dur­
ing the trimester beginning on Au­
gust 30, there will be no Saturday 
classes. A further decision was 
made to have a regular school day 
on July 5.
Mr. Collins, stated that he made 
a comparative analysis of the num­
ber of vacation days in the ASTP 
and Civilian programs and had dis­
tributed figures to the Board prior 
to its meeting.
On the basis of this study, it was 
voted that all programs run as usual 
on July 5. This is important be­
cause of the fact that male students 
are deferred so that they, like the 
soldiers, may receive training for 
the war effort as rapidly as possible.
he is modestly quiet. It seems, 
though, that he’s still looking for the 
right girl to fall in love with him. 
Marriage is another matter, how­
ever; he intends to apply the en­
gineering method of scientific selec­
tion to choosing a mate; so be on 
your good behavior, girls!
At present Al and a good pair of 
shoes have parted company, so if 
you see him forlornly wandering 
around Tech, just nod understand- 
ingly and hand him a number eight­
een stamp. If you stop to talk he’ll 
probably tell you that his greatest 
ambition is to put the name of Alvin 
I. Sher on every plumbing fixture in 
America (He’s a salesman at heart 
as well as an engineer).

No definite plans have been made

The increase in four-point-factor 
students on last semester’s honor 
roll proves that scholarship still 
reigns supreme on the Carnegie 
campus. The sophomores and fresh­
men led the other classes, each con­
tributing six four-pointers to the 
honor roll; while five juniors and 
four seniors earned the perfect, 
factor.

Large Steel Concern Makes Use Of 
Dr. Derge’s Scientific Apparatus
One of the most recent achieve­
ments resulting from research done 
in Carnegie Tech laboratories is the 
first commercial method for making 
an accurate and rapid analysis of the 
oxygen content of molten steel. 
Methods now employed are either 
inaccurate or too complicated for
I Vßfcw ,Lif

general use. The new apparatus for 
making the required analysis was 
designed by Dr. Gerhard Derge and 
his colleagues, and is now being 
used by the Carnegie Illinois Steel 
Company.
Not only has Dr. Derge reduced 
the time necessary for analysis, but 
he has devised a system for obtain­
ing samples which is superior to that 
now in general use. The difficulty 
in procuring a high grade sample 
can be explained by the reaction: 
C + FeO = Fe + CO. This reaction 
proceeds so rapidly that the carbon 
monoxide (CO) bubbles off leav­
ing a poor grade of iron. Aluminum 
is usually added to the iron oxide 
(FeO) on the theory that the two 
compounds will react to form Alu­
minum trioxide (A1203) and Iron.

The following equation shows this 
reaction: 3FeO + 2AL = A1203 +
3FE. Experiments have proved, 
however, that all of the aluminum 
does not react; hence, the resulting 
analysis is frequently inaccurate.
Dr. Derge uses a copper mold 
which gives the sample a wedge- 
shaped appearance. The sample is 
chilled so rapidly that the carbon 
monoxide has no time to escape in 
any appreciable quantity. Almost 
instantly the sample has been so 
thoroughly chilled that it can be re­
moved with bare hands. About 
three grams are then? cut off and 
placed into the apparatus for analy­
sis.
The first step, in the analysis is to 
melt the sample. A graphite cru­
cible in a quartz tube is used for this 
purpose. The crucible is surrounded 
by a water jacket which acts as a 
cooling agent. Heat is derived from 
a high-frequency coil which is placed 
around the entire crucible assem­
bly.
After the fusion (Melting) pro­
cess has been completed, the gas to 
be analyzed must be pumped into a 
container where it can be measured. 
A three-stage mercury diffusion 
pump which has been designed to 
operate at high speed against a 
high-back pressure has been found 
to be most practical. The total 
quantity of gas obtained from the 
sample is thus transferred from the 
fusion chamber into the reservoir. 
All that remains to be done is to 
take a reading of the gas pressure 
on a manometer. Experiments have 
proved that about .03 of the total 
quantity of gas is hydrogen and ni­
trogen; therefore, if this figure is 
subtracted from the total, the con­
tent of oxygen is what remains. 
Once the oxygen content has been 
analyzed, an oil pump evacuates the 
system and the process is started all 
over again with a new sample.
The actual analytical time for this 
process is about four minutes, and it 
is estimated that the information 
can be returned to the furnace oper­
ator ten minutes after he has taken 
the sample.

Emphasis Placed On 
Engineering In New 
Architecture Course
A new course, Architectural En­
gineering, leading to a degree of B. 
S. in Architecture will be offered by 
that department starting next se­
mester. The course differs from 
the regular Architecture Program in 
that it takes only four years instead 
of five to achieve the degree, and 
much greater emphasis is to be 
placed upon engineering. Although 
the subject is new at Carnegie, it 
has been taught for a number of 
years in many colleges not only in 
the United States, but also in Great 
Britain and Canada.
The primary purpose of Archi­
tectural Engineering is to train stu­
dents to meet the increasing de­
mands of the War Building Pro­
gram. As most .of these buildings 
are not expected to be either beau­
tiful or permanent, it is much more 
important for the architect design­
ing them to be grounded in engi­
neering principles rather than artis­
tic subjects. Great Britain and Can­
ada have found the work of architec­
tural engineers to be so valuable 
that students studying the course in 
those countries are entitled to serv­
ice deferments.
There are many subject changes 
in the Architectural Engineering 
Course as compared with regular 
Architecture. Some of the new sub­
jects to be taught are physics, sur­
veying, estimating, and town plan­
ning. To make room for these sub­
jects, students studying Architec­
tural Engineering will not take most 
of the art courses such as water color
100 ASTP Men Subscribe
The summer subscription cam­
paign for the CARNEGIE TARTAN 
has been very successful in spite of 
wartime difficulties. More than 100 
soldiers have already subscribed at 
the special rate for the summer. 
Chuck Fairchild is taking ASTP sub­
scriptions; any soldiers who wish to 
subscribe or who desire information 
should see him. All subscriptions 
should be in as soon as possible so 
that the subscribers can beat the 
special price deadline.
The regular civilian students re­
ceive their copies at no charge ex­
cept the general activities fee. This 
applies to evening students as well 
as day students.

ence will leave Friday afternoon

painting and freehand sketching, 
which are included in the regular 
architecture curriculum.
After the war, no new freshmen 
will be allowed to enfoll in the 
course, but those students who have 
already started will be allowed to 
earn their degrees. The Depart­
ment of Architecture, however, is 
of the opinion that after, the war 
there will be a great demand for 
architects to meet the need of post­
war building; hence, any student 
studying Architectural Engineer­
ing will be able to change his course 
to regular architecture. All fresh­
men architecture students will be 
eligible to enroll in the new course, 
which will not be accelerated.

School Receives Table As 
Gift From Westinghouse
When “Solitude,” the estate of 
George Westinghouse, Pittsburgh 
inventor arid philanthropist, was 
given to the city for a park, the 
house was dismantled and the West­
inghouse Company acquired an elab­
orately carved golden oak table. A 
short time ago the company offered 
this table to Carnegie Tech which 
has a George Westinghouse Pro­
fessorship in the Engineering Col­
lege as well as a large number of 
Westinghouse students. The table 
has been placed in the office of the 
Westinghouse Professor of Engi­
neering College, Douglas F. Miner, 
who is now on leave as a Major in 
the Army.
Because little is known of the 
origin of the table, its value lies in 
the fact that it belonged to Mr. 
Westinghouse. The school will 
place an appropriately inscribed 
plate on the table which will be a 
symbol of the great engineer. The 
table is a rather massive thing 
weighing 380 pounds. The table top 
is supported by the upraised arms of 
four carved figures which serve as 
legs.
ASTP Men Receive PFC’s
A recent War Department release 
stated that the enlisted men of the 
7th Grade (Private) will be promot­
ed to the grade of Private First Class 
when they move up from the basic 
phase to the advanced phase of the 
ASTP.
Enlisted men of the 7th Grade 
who are already assigned to the ad­
vanced phase of the Program with­
out previous instruction in the basic 
phase will be promoted to the 
grade of Private First Class. The 
men at Carnegie, however, have 
about eight more months to go be­
fore they are eligible for this rank 
and pay boost.

Recent Action Taken 
By Intramural Board
At the last meeting of the Intra­
mural Board, which took place 
Wednesday, June 16, action was 
taken concerning a formal protest, 
the use of an ineligible player by a 
participating team, and a forfeited 
game. -
In the case of the protested 
game, the teams involved were Cit- 
com and Company A, Platoon 4. In 
their game on June 2 a player was 
permitted by the umpire to advance 
to first base after the catcher had 
dropped a third strike. According to 
the official softball rules, the bat­
ter should have been called out au­
tomatically by the umpire. The bat­
ter was permitted to take first base 
by the umpire, and eventually scor­
ed the winning run for Citcom, the 
score being 4-3. This was clearly

This game, played last Monday in the 
Carnegie Bowl, was the second win of the 
season for» the Delts.
a case of the umpire being in error, 
and the A-4 manager, realizing this, 
filed a formal protest with the um­
pire at that time. The matter was 
brought before the Intramural 
Board, and the Board decided that 
the fair thing to do would be to have 
the game played over, not counting 
the score in the league standings. It 
should be noted here that the Board 
will only consider protests that have 
been filed no later than 24 hours 
after the finish of the game in ques­
tion.
The case was brought up to the 
Board about the use of an ineligi­
ble player, whose name appeared on 
two rosters and who played games 
for both teams. Through some mis­
understanding Perry Culver’s name 
was included in the rosters of both 
the Sigma Alpha Epsilon squad and 
the team from Cedar Hall. Also Cul­
ver played ball on both these teams,

PiKAs And Tau Delts Reach 
Front In Championship Race
The third week of mushball start­
ed out with a bang last Monday as 
the first Platoon of Company A 
went down to defeat at the hands of 
the PiKA’s, 4-3. This was the first 
loss in five games for the army 
team, and the second win in 
as many games for the civilian 
aggregation. The loss deprived the 
ASTP boys of first place in League
I, and allowed the PiKA’s to take 
over that spot. The fraternity men 
only had six hits to seven for the 
army, but they bunched most of 
them for three runs in the fifth, 
which afforded them the margin of 
victory.

and living at Cedar Hall. It was 
learned that he played ball for the 
Cedar Hall team before playing for 
the SAE’s, and on that basis the 
Board ruled that he was ineligible 
for the SAE squad. In cases of this 
nature the policy of the intramural 
Board is to rule that the team which 
employs a player first is the team 
which has the right to use him in 
games they are to play. Further­
more to prevent recurance of this, 
the Board now has a ruling which 
states that the use of an ineligible 
player will result in the forfeiture 
of the game in question.
The Beta Theta Pi team was fin­
ed $2.50 for the forfeiture of a game. 
This fine mUst be paid in order to 
continue in the competition. And 
a recurance will likely result in 
expulsion from the league.
was made when the Tau Delts de­
feated the A-3 nine 1-0 in League HI. 
Yorkin of the Tau Delts allowed but 
three hits, while his team-mates 
bunched two of their three in the 
sixth for their lone tally. The Delts 
nosed out a 3-2 win over the A-4 
team in the Carnegie Bowl behind 
Merle Wolff’s four-hit pitching to 
hold third place in League III. In 
the other game on Monday, the 
Betas, after trying unsuccessfully 
to postpone the game at noon time, 
forfeited to 4-2, and the score was 
automatically set at 1-0.
Tuesday’s games were all rained 
out after the third inning of play, 
but one of these games, between 
B-l and B-2, was played off on Sat­
urday, the B-l nine garnering the 
victory 5-1.
Wednesday, Corwin of the Beta 
Sigs hurled a masterful two-hitter 
against Cedar Hall, as the dorm 
men fell to defeat 9-1. Cedar got 
their one run in the last inning as 
the fraternity men let off the pres­
sure and rested on their big lead. 
The DU’s lost to the fifth platoon of 
Company A, even though Frank 
Showman outpitched his adversary 
5 hits to 6. The slugging soldiers 
from the first platoon of Company 
A knocked out 13 hits to give Gaza 
another win as they defeated B-3 to 
the tune of a 9-1 score. The fourth 
and fifth platoons of Company B 
went down to their third straight 
defeat 9-6 at the hands of the A-4 
team, giving the Company A squad 
their second win of the season.

Football Prospects 
By J. Lindberg, Sports Editor
There is much discussion on cam­
pus these days concerning the pos­
sibilities of having a varsity football 
team next year. This, of course, has 
all come about by the lack of man­
power at Tech, and the question is 
largely whether or not there will be 
enough civilians in school during 
the fall term to support a varsity 
team. It may be recalled that last 
fall it was necessary to dispense the 
Freshman Ineligibility Rule and to 
permit the use of freshmen in var­
sity competition. Tech was not the 
only school in the athletic world to 
adopt such a policy. Most of the 
schools in the district found it neces­
sary to do the same thing, and the 
Southern Conference, which in­
cludes most of the outstanding teams 
in the South, were also obliged to 
repeal the ruling.
This was definitely a wise thing 
for Carnegie Tech to do, since some 
of the outstanding members of last 
year’s team were freshmen. Ralph 
Carnahan and Warren Hall were 
two examples. The possibility of a 
recurance of this is fairly good, 
since the freshmen that entered last 
winter and this spring seem to be 
quite interested in football. Several 
have approached this writer per­
sonally, asking about the situation.
In fact, a few have inquired when 
practice will start. Some suggested 
that the team begin work-outs im­
mediately, and that those fellows 
interested in football could begin 
getting in shape, learn a few plays, 
and begin signal drills. Perhaps
hitting the dummy and a few light 
scrimmages could be included. This 
is all mere possibility, but it il­
lustrates the attitude and interest 
some of the freshmen are display­
ing, a fact which will go far in the 
final decision.
There are only a mere handful 
of men left from last year’s team to 
form a nucleus for a new team, but 
Tech is no worse off than other 
schools. The Athletic Director at 
Washington State College has made 
the statement that the enrollment 
will be 90% girls this fall. Washing­
ton State was one of the leading 
contenders in the race to the Rose 
Bowl last year. The men who won 
letters from last season include 
Reid Byers, Dave Crump, Cliff 
Mikus, Ben Backlarz, and John 
Lindberg —a fullback, two guards, 
and two tackles.
It is unfortunate that the ASTP 
men are not permitted to participate 
in intercollegiate athletics, for their 
ranks include men who have play­
ed a lot of football at other 
schools. However, there is a good 
possibility that a team will be form­
ed when the time comes, and games 
can be played between the varsity 
and the army teams. Schools like 
the Case School of Applied Sci­
ence that have navy programs will 
be permitted to use navy men, pro­
vided there is sufficient time avail­
able. However, this may not mean 
much, for the navy programs are 
similar to the ASTP programs as far 
as time is concerned.

Athletics
Mr. Lindberg reported that the min­
utes for the last Intramural Board Meet­
ing are not as yet available.
NEW BUSINESS
Mr. Murphy asked whether or not 
freshman regulations should be observed 
next semester. Miss Schädel is to find out 
if any more armbands must be ordered 
for the freshman girls; and Mr. Sher is 
to consider the matter of regulations for 
men. Both are to report at the next 
meeting.
Since an election must soon be held to 
determine the regular representatives of

investigate the manner in which this elec­
tion can be held and report next week.
Miss Schädel will be out of town for the 
rest of this semester and asked what 
should be done to fill this vacancy. It 
was decided that the Vice-President of 
the M.M.C.C. Senate, Sally Marshall, 
should fill the vacancy if it is agreeable 
to her.
It was decided that an Assistant Sec­
retary for A.C.A.C. be elected. This girl 
must be a Junior Secretarial student. 
Petitions must be in the Student Council 
office before Thursday* June 26, at 4:30 
p.m.
Adjournment.
Respectfully submitted,

8THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, JUNE 22, 1943

He plays reveille at 6:15 every 
morning — is the best loved and 
most cursed at man in the ASTP.
I found him in Welch Hall, play­
ing the “Cow Cow Boogie” just a lit­
tle hotter than usual. There were 
four of them crowded over a couple 
of pieces of music tapping out an 
eight-to-the-bar rhythm in prepara­
tion for the ACAC Dance. Herb was 
on the business end of a trumpet.
It wasn’t exceedingly difficult to 
convince him that he was a famous 
personage and worthy of attention. 
He neglected the rest of the boys— 
turned towards me—and poured out 
the story of Pvt. Herb Savage, 
ASTP bugler, trumpeteer, and com­
edian.
The way he tells it, it was a mo­
mentous day for Wichita, Kansas, 
February 11, 1924, when young Her­
bert Savage was born—with a trum­
pet mouthpiece and a wisecrack on 
his lips. He proudly adds that be­
sides being one day and one hundred 
and fifteen years younger than Lin­
coln, Thomas A. Edison also shares 
his February 11 birthday. He attend­
ed Hutchinson High School, “right 
smack in the middle of Kansas”— 
succeeded in being a poor student 
and part of a track team that won 
the state championship. When I in­
quired whether he was a good run­
ner, he was somewhat taken back. 
“Good,” he said, “God, I was ter­
rific.”
The boys started in with their 
rendition of “I’ve Heard That Song 
Before.” After they finished, Herb 
wiped his mouthpiece and said, 
“The women are all crazy about 
me—that is all except a nice red­
head who drives around Tech in a 
green convertible.” As far as women 
go, Herb has one of his own down 
at Ward-Belmont College, Nash­
ville, Tenn. When I inquired what 
course she was taking, he shrugged 
his shoulders and muttered “Who 
knows?”
It was inevitable that the con­
versation would wind around to the 
Army. “I wasn’t drafted,” Herb 
proudly stated. “I’m a volunteer— 
I joined the army so that I could 
get into the scrap, and—Herb 
checked himself and said, “Remem­
ber, you can’t print that.” I assur­
ed him that I had no intention of
Important!
It has come to the attention of the 
Staff that there is a need to have the 
Grill open on Sundays. Students who 
live in the Dorms or in nearby pri­
vate homes have no place to eat their 
Sunday meals. The administration 
has promised to open the Grill pro­
viding enough students plan to use 
it, to make the undertaking practical.
It is very important, therefore, that 
all students who would like to have 
the Grill open on Sundays, and who 
plan to eat there each Sunday, sign 
the following notice, tear it out, and 
put it in the Inter-school mail for the 
TARTAN office today or tomorrow.
MAIL TO TARTAN OFFICE!
I would like to have the Grill opened 
so I could eat there on Sundays.

doing anything of the sort—and that 
his desires would be respected.
Being an interview, it was only 
normal to ask his favorite comedian, 
joke, and classical composer. “I like 
Ish Kabibble.” Herb kidded, “and 
for my favorite composer, I have 
none. Oh yes, wHo is the guy that

he inquired. From across the room 
a long-hair answered “Beethoven” 
and Herb quickly retorted, “Yeh— 
Beethoven, he’s my favorite com­
poser.” His best joke is unprintable, 
but quite good.
The boys picked up their instru­
ments, and I gathered the interview 
was at a close. I said goodbye, and 
Herb blew a high C in return.
Institute To Present 
Summer Art Exhibit
The Carnegie Institute will pre­
sent a show, known as the Summer 
Exhibition of Pittsburgh Artists, 
from June 10 until August 1. It 
will enable Pittsburghers to get an 
idea of the current painting in Pitts­
burgh.
The exhibitors are selected by the 
staff of the Department of Fine 
Arts. Thirty-four artists have been 
chosen; each artist is to send two 
paintings. A total of sixty-four 
paintings has been sent; the two 
artists who did not send paintings 
are in the Army. The only restric­
tion imposed is that the artists live 
within the limits of Allegheny 
County.
Among those representing Car­
negie Tech are: Professors William
A. Readio, Clarence H. Carter, Bal- 
comb Greene, Robert L. Lepper, 
Samuel Rosenberg, Raymond Sim- 
boli, Lloyd Wininger, Kermit C. 
Ewing, Associate Professors Nor­
wood Mac Gilvary, and Esther Topp 
Edmonds. The only students repre­
sented are Richard E. Williams 
and Frank D. Trapp.
The first show was given in 1932, 
and one has been given each sum­
mer since then. The representation 
this year is the greatest since the 
programs were started, even though 
four of the artists are in the Army. 
All these artists are keeping up with 
the tradition “quality instead of 
quantity” in the first wartime pro­
gram ever presented by the Sum­
mer Show.
Ah, Sense Of Humor, 
Thy Name Is ASTP
After two comparatively tame 
weeks, the Tech Army is experi­
encing another tumultuous uproar. 
It seems some new soldiers are slat­
ed to move in, and living quarters 
are in a state of liquid motion— 
we’re moving around like all Hell, 
believe me.
T’other day change of quarters 
came to usually complacent Hen­
derson Hall. It was awful, “Women, 
men, little children lost their lives, 
when the great ship went down.”
These are still traces of the hor­
rible carnage: broken light bulbs, 
smashed slide rules, socks, and here 
and there a bloody skull—one who 
couldn’t stand the gaff.
Soldiers, clad in GI underwear, 
dashing all around, up and down the 
stairs, in and out of every room, 
hanging out the windows; many 
died from the strain, others are in 
the infirmary as a result of the 
heavy back-breaking labor. And the 
result, the first floor moved to the 
second, and the second—you guess­
ed it. The second floor moved to the 
first.
The above small item was not the 
only momentous change. Where 
there were formerly only three and 
four Army students living in quar­
ters built for two; now there are 
six—some times five.
In case you ever pass the Army 
dorms, don’t fail to look closely at 
Henderson. Up on the second floor 
you’ll be able to make out the odd­
ly shaped forms of hammocks, sus­
pended from phone and light wires. 
Friends, people SLEEP in those 
things. There just ain’t room in the 
rooms. ’Sail there is to it.
Oh yes, studying is lotsa fun these 
days too. About six to a one man 
desk, never more than six though. 
In a certain suite there was a case 
of one guy’s sayin’ “move over, I 
wanna breathe.” Then there’s the 
other example of a student who 
whispered in a study hour, mind 
you, “inhale, I gotta use m’slide 
rule.”
Three men on the first floor are 
sleeping in Murphy beds, upright 
Murphy beds. Two more spend 
study time in the shower since there 
ain’t enough room to sit cross-leg- 
ged on the floor, let alone sit at 
desks.
So the next time you pass a sol­
dier whose head faces the wrong 
way, you’ll know that he was dou­
ble timed on the way to the sink 
one morning.
SPEE Elects Doherty 
President At Convention
Robert E. Doherty was elected 
president of the Society for the Pro­
motion of Engineering Education at 
its fifteenth anniversary meeting at 
Drake Hotel in Chicago during the 
week-end of June 18-20. The prece­
dent of electing the Senior Vice 
President to the head position was 
broken this year as President Doher­
ty was promoted to his present post 
from his office of Chairman of the 
Administrative Division of the 
SPEE.
Director Webster N. Jones, Col­
lege of Engineering also J attended 
the meeting. News of this event has
300 Couples Dance For 
“Smokes For Victory”
“Two twenty-fifths of a million 
cigarettes free greet our boys across 
the sea.” Lucky Strike announcers 
aren’t the only ones who can say 
that now. Because on Saturday 
night, July 3, 300 couples are going 
to dance at the Schenley Hotel Ball- > 
room from 9 to 1 for the Smokes for 
Victory Campaign that the Amer­
ican Legion and Sun-Telegraph are 
sponsoring.
Soldiers and girls are invited— 
tickets are free for the soldiers and 
$1 for the girls. Tech, Pitt, Du- 
quesne, P. C. W., and Mount Mercy 
are participating, so only 50 girls 
from Tech will be able to go. 
The men featured will be 100 Air 
Cadets from Pitt, 100 from Du- 
quesne, and 100 of our soldiers at 
Tech. The music featured will be by 
Babe Rhodes, WCAE Staff Orches­
tra. As an added attraction Abe 
Lyman, who will be at the Stanley 
Theater that week, will play from 
12 to 1 to cap a fitting climax to 
the evening’s festivities.
The dance will be a Tag Dance 
to enable everybody to meet every­
body else. Hurry, soldiers and gals, 
get your tickets from Marie Sunseri 
or Helen Robinson to give our boys 
overseas that good American cigar­
ette they’ve been wanting.
A. S. M. E. Convention 
To Be held June 25-26
The American Society of Mechan­
ical Engineers will hold its Tenth 
National Convention under the 
auspices of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology and the Pittsburgh Sec­
tion of the A. S. M. E., June 25-26. 
The program is composed of a num­
ber of meetings, each presenting a 
wide variety of new developments.
A series of lectures will be given by 
men prominent in their respective 
fields.
Mr. L. H. Donnell of the Illinois 
Institute of Technology will be 
chairman of the Plasticity Session, 
Mr. M. Hetenyi of the Westinghouse 
Co., of the Elasticity and Photoelas­
ticity Session, and Mr. L. M. Tich- 
vinsky of Annapolis, of the Mechan­
ics of Machines, Vibration, and Ther­
modynamics Session.
There will be a dinner Friday 
night, June 25, in Webster Hall Ho­
tel. It is open to the Tech faculty 
and students who are interested, and 
who have made reservations. Dr. 
Doherty will give a few informal re­
marks after dinner; then Dr. Robert 
F. Mehl, also of Carnegie Tech, will 
discuss the Electron Microscope. Dr. 
Charles S. Barrett will give a dem­
onstration, which will conclude the 
dinner.
This convention will enable en­
gineers to get first-hand information 
on the developments of the year. 
Each of the subjects presented has 
a direct bearing on the war and the 
world after the war.
special significance and interest to 
engineering students of Carnegie as 
the Social Relations Program is a 
direct outcome of the SPEE aims 
and principles.
