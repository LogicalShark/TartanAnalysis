0. T. C. FNBni.I MF.HTS SHOULD BE MADE AT ONCE
The past week lias seen many new 
3evelopments in Tech’s latest de­
partment,' the R. O. T. C. Colonel 
3rooks and his staff are busy inter-' 
dewing students about the outlined 
courses and can always be found in 
his office for the purpose. The list 
>f students enrolled has started well 
md is steadily growing larger. By 
ast Saturday Signal. Corps had had 
enough men signed up to insure its 
establishment and the other branches 
ire being well supported also.
In response to a requisition sent 
o Washington for equipment, five 
ion-commissioned officers have ar- 
ived. They will be followed by a 
ietail of privates, who will take care 
if the material as it arrives. The 
chool has received permission from 
lie city to use the stables on the 
)val, and will build as many more 
;here as needed.
It is hoped that those men who 
ntend to enroll for the R. O. T. C. 
ivill do so at once. It is necessary 
'or the military authorities to know 
iefinitely how many students are go­
ng to enroll before ordering the bal- 
ince of the equipment. As soon as 
his knowledge is at hand the sup- 
>lies will be ordered, and “first come, 
irst served,” this means that if you 
iign up now, instead of a week from 
¡ow, Tech will receive preference in 
he quantity and quality of military 
upplies needed to maintain the de- 
artment. Remember, it is not bind- 
lg, and is so stated on the blanks.
If you are in doubt, call on the 
olonel and ask him about the points 
ou. are not clear on. He will be 
lad to help you out.

It is for the purpose of getting

The first General Assembly of the 
iring quarter was addressed by Mr. 
obert W. Campbell of Chicago, on 
safety and the Education of Safety 
j, ngineers.” Mr. Campbell, who was 
fitroduced by Professor Follows, is 
le first president of. tlio National 
afety Council.
At a convention of the National 
afety Council, to which all colleges 
* id universities east of Chicago were 
lvited, a committee of four was ap- 
ointed to start something along a 
ine of safety educational engineer­
ing.
Professor Follows, who was a rep­
resentative from Tech, was one of 
pjhe four men appointed on this com- 
[riiittee. As a consequence, a course 
a such a line has been started at 
i. ¦ ""h. At present, thirty-two students 
I _ enrolled in this particular course. 
ff • A request was sent to the Na- 
1 ional Safety Council for speakers and 
rfis a result Mr. Campbell will deliver 
i series of three lectures of which 
. he one last week was the first.I
ln speaking of the National Safety 
Movement, Mr. Campbell stated that 
t represents the co-operative epoch 
n industry. Such a movement will 
lower the death rates of industries, 
which are vastly greater than those 
of war. The movement/had its be­
ginning when twelve years ago, sev­
eral industrial concerns began inves­
tigations separately on lines of or­
ganization, safeguarding and educa­
tion. In 1905-6 a meeting was held 
in New York and in 1908 the Illinois 
Steel Company began a campaign for 
increased safety and appointed com­
mittees in each of five plants. These 
committees, which were to attend to 
the matter, included workmen and 
foremen.
Many problems arose in safe­
guarding. First, safeguards had to
NINETY DOLLARS WAS GIVEN TO FRENCH ORPHAN BY TECH
That Daffodil Day was a great suc­
cess and netted almost $90, means 
that somewhere in France, a little 
boy whose father died heroically be­
fore most of us were even thinking 
of the war, will receive enough 
money to enable him to live in his 
own home and attend school, thus 
helping the rebuilding of France. 
After all, it took very little to make 
this little boy’s life worth living.
Daffodil Day is an annual luxury 
of the present Junior Class in M. M. 
D., and it is to their own particular 
orphan, Monsieur Marcel Furaut, that 
most of the money will go.
Miss Harriet Stone deserves thanks 
for getting the flowers.
A Response
Thanks, Mr. Editor, for inviting 
the alumni into your columns. This 
body has generally felt that there 
was not much room for it in the 
rush of actual college life; that it 
occupied about the same status, in 
the mind of it« Alma Mater, as the 
supposed corpse, who so blithely re­
turned to find, not the glad hand he 
expected, but that startled expres­
sion, which says, “what do you want 
now?—we thought we were rid of 
you.”
Therefore, when the editorial sum­
mons, “Lazarus come forth,” reaches 
the ear, it would be churlish not to 
respond—sp here we are' to proclaim 
the same, if not greater, interest in 
the success of Th^ Tartan, as the 
mouthpiece of the Four S'chools.
The courage of the editor, in the 
face of what appears as utter lack 
of co-operation on the part of all who 
Should'strive to make the sheet rep­
resentative of school spirit and 
achievement, has beeil commendable. 
Most men would have “chucked it” 
and said “nobody cares;” that is 
why we rise from the tomb to say, 
the Alumni cares, and cares might­
ily, that this sheet shall measure up 
to its highest possibilities. That it 
shall not be “spit upon” by other col­
lege papers, as it is sure to be, if 
Tech does' not become alive to its 
opportunities. M. M. C. has saved 
it from utter desolation—M. M. C. 
and athletics. Has Industries noth­
ing to contribute—has Science wan­
dered into such abstract realms that 
it no longer touches terre ferma?
What about all these returning 
heroes? What about all Tech’s men 
and women wandering around the 
world—why, there ought to be so 
much “copy'” in every mail that the 
editor would cry aloud for help to 
read it. He has cried—but for copy! 
Wake i£p- Surprise him and let the 
world know that technical schools 
train heads as well as hands.

of closer co-operation between em­
ployer and employe.
Out of this grew the need for some 
organization, so the National Safety 
Council was formed. This body de­
veloped out of the Iron and Steel

VARSITY TIES ALL-STARS'MUSICAL CLUBS LEAVEFOR SEASON’S BIG TRIPThe All-Stars who were defeated 
by the Tech baseball team a week ago, 
returned last Saturday for another 
try at our varsity. The game re­
sulted in a tie score, 7 to 7, in nine 
innings. The All-Stars presented 
practically the same lineup that ap­
peared here on April 12. Don Blythe, 
former Grove City star, at third base, 
“Buck” Baird of Penn State, ’18, in 
left field. Bob Kessler, Penn State, '15, 
at the keystone sack, “Tubby” Lam 
behind the bat, “Dummy” Marks at 
first base, and our own “Doc” Marks 
at short.
Wardwoll, Penn State. .’15, • and 
Carts, did the twirling for the visi­
tors.
Weiss and Gretzler did some nice 
work in the box for Tech, although 
“Gretz” was as wild as a pair of 
deuces, he had plenty of speed and 
stuff on the ball.
Umpire Dick Guy, of the Gazette 
Times, was showered with pop bot­
tles from the visitors’ stand for some 
of his wild guesses on close plays, 
and “Doc” Marks was also caught 
trying to bribe “Dick.” Don Blythe’s 
pack of Mail Pouch gave out in the 
fifth inning and “Dummy” Marks was 
heard to say that no teafii could play 
ball without the “chewing.”
Thore was a decided improvement 
in the fielding of the Varsity, and 
Lundell and Gates did some heavy 
hitting. Summary:

NOTES OF GAME
Baird and Carts had a friendly 
wrostling match over LundeU's drive 
in tlie sixth, neither one capturing 
the ball. “Doc” Marks did a sprint 
to left field after the ball. Lundell 
completing the circuit in the mean­
time.
“Tubby” Lain lost 15 pounds dur­
ing the afternoon. He swears he 
dropped 10 of the 15 when ho tried 
to scale the cliff for a foul tip.
Lundell, a new man just' out of 
the service, showed up well. He 
gathered three hits in as many trips 
to the plate.
Durkins, formerly of Indiana Nor­
mal, gave a pretty exhibition of field­
ing at short.
H. Marks’ poor eyesig'ht, and clev- 
I er fielding by the team, enabled 
\ “Gretz” to retire the visitors on five 
pitched balls in the sixth.
Westminster plays Tech at Tech 
field Saturday, April 26, at 3 o’clock. 
Westminster is said to have a strong 
team this year and hopes to give 
Tech a battle royal. Let’s see 
everybody out next Saturday for the 
second big game of the year.

TWO ARTILLERY OFFICERS ARRIVE AT CARNEGIE
Captains Knight and Bell have ar 
rived at Tech, They are detailed as 
instructors in Field Artillery. Cap­
tain Knight came from Fort Sill, Ok­
lahoma, while Captain Bell came from 
France, where he has seen consider­
able active service, being in Colonel 
Cole’s command.
¦ The Musical Clubs leave today for 
their long-anticipated trip through 
Western Pennsylvania and Eastern 
Ohio. It will bo the most successful 
trip ever undertaken, for the cluus 
are larger and more experienced this 
season than ever before. Forty men 
will go on the trip—twenty from the 
Glee Club and twenty from the Man­
dolin Club. The great success of 
all previous concerts this season is 
assurance that the trip will be the 
best ever. The olubs will return Sat­
urday and will begin immediate 
preparations for the fourteenth an­
nual home concert in Carnegie Mu­
sic Hall on May 9.

COMPLETE PROGRAM FOR INTER-CLASS TRACK MEET
Interclass Track Meet postponed 
until April 28. The change in the 
date set for the interclass track meet 
was necessary because on Monday, 
April 21 the Department of Industries 
is going to have no classes. The 
date has been set now for Monday, 
April 28—next Monday—Are you go­
ing to be there and run for your class? 
If you are not going to run, be there 
and cheer for your class mates who 
are in the meet.
The Interclass track meet Is a new 
event at Tech. In the past, the ath­
letic activities, within the Institute 
have been in the form of Interschool 
track meets. This year the new cus­
tom has been started of having the 
interschool track meet replaced by 
the interclass track meet, The first 
year class of the three schools, De­
sign, Science and Industrys, will enter 
the meet as a unit, as will the second, 
third and fourth year classes. The 
entry list for the meet are shown 
on this page, Keep this Issue of 
your Tartan and use the entry list

graduates and former students in this 
regiment; men famous in Tech ath­
letics, such as "Sunny" Kesner and 
Alexander Brunwasser and a host of 
others. Then among the graduates, 
such men as Captain E. E. Duff, who 
was editor of The Tartan one year, 
and interested in many student activ­
ities.
Student committees have been 
formed in all the schools to carry out 
the plans for the morning. These 
committees are as follows:
Science—Edward Hirsch, ’19; Lind- 
ley Aul, ’20; James F. Giffin, ’20.
Design—I. S. Stark, ’19; O. R. 
Olmst.ead, ’19; Ella Louise McMahon, 
*19; Mildred Floyd, ’19.
Industry—J. W. Batam, ’19; R. p. 
Avery. ’19; R. W. Seidel, ’20.
As the Margaret Morrison School 
is on vacation this week, it was not 
possible to have a committee nom­
inated.
Here’s where Tech will fit into the 
plans of the Mayor's Committee of 
welcome. A portion of the sidewalk, 
.along Grant boulevard, Schenley 
Farm, has been reserved for Tooh 
students. Headed by Sully's famous 
band, the students will march over 
from the campus In a body to take 
position along tho boulevard. Pla­
cards tacked 'to long sticks with va­
rious Inscriptions will bo carried. Tho 
old time Tech spirit will bo much In 
evidence, when tho regiment comos 
into view, and what will happen to 
the placards, who* cares. Tho Alumni 
office has record of (ho following 
graduates and students in tlio regi­
ment:
day and then go to Camp Sherman 
for demobilization.
Perhaps, it may be possible for the 
students to arrange a big entertain­
ment when they return to Pittsburgh, 
after being mustered out. Let us 
get our heads together and try to 
plan something along this line. Why 
not combine a little celebration in 
the afternoon with a dinner in the 
evening and attendance at the home 
concert of the Musical Club, with a 
dance following. It sounds like an­
other big day at Tech.
NOTICE
The Second Semester of the Night 
Courses in the Division of Industries, 
ends on Friday, April 25, 1919.
AH Final Examinations arc to be 
held on the last recitation evening 
during the week of APRIL 21. The 
schedule of Final Examinations for 
the Night General Studiies Course 
may be seen on the Faculity and Stu­
dent Bulletin Boards.
AT THE EDITOR'S DESK
We hear continual ‘‘kicks*’ and 
knocks at the English Department 
here at Tech. Wonder if the English 
Department doesn't smile and say, 
“Where ignorance is bliss.''
To some students, nothing ever hap­
pens at Tech.
The plans, to repeat the design cos­
tume ball is falling through. That is 
good. They need the time for school 
work.
We tough at Ira Stark and ‘‘kid" 
him too, but he is for Tech all the 
time. Would that there were more 
like him!
The Faculty "Guillotine" has fallen 
again. Noticed several “Budding” 
Freshmen with suitcases, saying,’— 
------ Tech.
Girls and Tech don’t agree with 
Freshmen.
Can’t help but notice the change the 
Faculty has brought about in the’ Set 
ence Freshmen. They have come 
down to live with the rest of us.
The Mechanicals always did say 
Prof. Trinks was Tech's best man. 
The Juniors know it now. Wednesday 
afternoon off. First in two years, 
‘‘‘Hot Dogs!"
FIT TO PRINT
Margaret Morrison Division wishes 
to tell the other Tech divisions that 
it is far better to never have a va­
cation than to return to work after 
one—almost.
If the boys at Tech think they 
were held up and robbed two days 
preceding M. M. vacation—let them 
know* that they were merely in train­
ing for the Victory Loan Drive hold­
up. In this case vacation and prepa­
ration are synonymous.
French Orphan Day! Belgian 
Orphan Day! When you learned 
how successful they were, and how 
much they helped, aren’t you sorry 
that there wasn't a day for each of 
the Allied countries?
This is the time of year when the 
world comes out strong in Freshmen 
colors.
The question before e.very Amei> 
ican this week is did you get ?50 
worth of Victory, or didn’t you?
Do you think the Tech boys who 
gave their lives for Victory would 
have hesitated at $50, bearing 4% 
per cent interest?
Buy a bond, if only to show the 
American Watch on the Rhine, that 
you are as wound up to Victory as 
they—and that you haven’t forgot­
ten them.
Can’t 3rou afford a bond? What 
about cigarettes, candy and movies?
That German helmet to be given 
the person who gets the most sub­
scriptions at Tech, will be the most 
becoming th«‘it he or she has ever 
wore. >

THE BOLSHEVIKI BALLET
On Saturday evening of last week, 
the great Russian danseuse, Mad­
emoiselle Hardas Zelle positively 
hypnotized her distinguished audi­
ence with her unique dancing. From 
the rise of the curtain until the end, 
the audience sat on the very ends of 
their seats, so thrilled were they by 
her marvelous shuffling.
The -first number of her repertoire 
was a pageant called the Dance of 
Angels. In this number, Mademoiselle 
Hardas Zelle was ably assisted by 
Ikan Shimytu, the great Australian 
Twitcher. The Dance of Angels start­
ed oft with the Mademoiselle jumping 
twenty feet in the air, at the same 
time swinging her feet over her head, 
forming an acute angle.while Ikan 
Shimytu climbed fifteen feet in the 
air and formed an obtuse angle. with 
his legs to supplement the acute angle. 
This position was held * for an hour, 
during which time postum, doughnuts 
and hickory nuts were served. Ikan 
Shimytu then formed a right angle by 
standing on one leg and extending the 
other out sideways. ' Just to show 
what a darn good angle this was, the 
Mademoiselle did some trapeze stunts 
on it, doing the two and a half kip 
and the giant swing. It was while do­
ing this Ikan Shimytu became

we can only say that Mademesoillo. the firstt is all tliat*8 both’ring you: 
Hardas Zelle and all membeys of the 
ballet showed themselves wonderfully.
The last number of the evening’s 
prwogram was a solo by the Madem­
oiselle herself. Her lithe, limp, limber 
form dislocated itself in every direc­
tion of the tune of Grabuisky’s Sonata.
As the music diminished, so did her 
motion, until only a faint quiver of her 
left, eyebrow was noticeable. But now 
the music swelled, and gathering her­
self together, she flung her limbs with 
great eclat in this direction and that.
The climax was reached when she 
clicked her heels over her head, 
stamping out every third beat on the 
floor with her left foot, snapping her 
fingers with one hand, and leading the 
orchestra with the other. With a final 
kick and yell the curtain dropped and 
thus ended a glorious evening.
Among the noted personages noted 
by our correspondent in the audience 
were: Count Rolling'-St'one-No-Moss,
his co-partner. Count De Gakiack, and 
Professor Smith, of the Chemistry De­
partment. R. E. T.

Open Mondfiy, Wednesday and Saturday Evenings the 
nights you don’t study so hard.
In accordance with the program 
laid out by the Council of National 
Defense who have been urging educa- 
cational. institutions to recruit the 
man power of the nation for the rais­
ing of foodstuffs, the Margaret Mor­
rison Division of the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, in Pittsburgh, 
have gone a step further and are re: 
cruiting the “girl power” for this 
purpose. The girl “farmerettes” re­
cruited are not drawn from the stu­
dent body but are composed of girls 
employed in nearby offices, stores, 
factories and in the majority of in­
stances are girls who are financially 
unable to enjoy summer vacations. In 
enlisting in the “farmerettes” the 
girls are not only afforded ap oppor­
tunity of doing their bit in the pro­
duction of the foodstuffs, so sorely 
needed but are given a summer vaca­
tion that will benefit them physically 
and financially as well. Before leav­
ing for the summer camp the girls 
are formed into classes that meet 
three evenings a week and are taught 
not only the domestic sciences, cook­
ing, sewing, millinery but are given 
instruction in dramatics ' and a 
thorough course in physical training 
and hygienics. A part of the physical 
training consists of dancing; both! 
esthetic and folk dancing.
On June 1 the girls leave for Camp1 
Louise Carnegie, situated t Glencair, 
-thirty miles above Pittsburgh, on the 
shores of the beautiful Allegheny riv­
er. in camp the girls will live in a 
huge rambling structure called the 
Mansion House. This building lias 
about twenty-five rooms and is full 
of nooks and crannies, bable roofs 
and dormer windows so dear to the 
feminine heart. All the rooms are 
open to the sunshine and breezes 
that sweep up the Allegheny. Here 
the real work of the summer will be 
taken up and the girls will not only 
raise crops but the crops will be the 
direct means of raising strong 
healthy girls. Under the leadership 
of Miss Grace Brogan, the “farmer­
ettes” will be tught to plant, till the 
ground and harvest the crops.
The physical training of the gii’ls 
in camp will not simply consist of the 
work they do in the fields but Miss 
Helene Burckhalter, who has been re­
tained as physical director of the 
camp will put the girls through a 
daily course of athletic training part 
of which, will be long “hikes.” A 
“hiking” class will be formed and 
girls will be taught to follow in the 
footsteps of our mothers who thought 
nothing of walking a mile or two 
long before the advent of the street 
car and the automobile.
However, it will not be all work I 
and no play, for these “farmerettes” 
will have their, regular times for 
wholesome recreation and may swim, 
boat, dance and play tennis. After 
the actual planting, the work will not 
be so hard and more leisure time will 
be given.
For all work the girls do tfiey will 
be paid an hourly wage and from this 
sum will be deducted their board so 
the expedition will’ not be classified 
as charity. In fact, the wage will be 
sufficient that by close application 
to their work the girls may each have 
a small surplus left at the end of 
the summer, so they may start back 
to iheir winter’s work, richer in 
health and posketbook as well and 
with the consciousness that they have 
“done their bit” in helping feed the 
people.
Classes have already been formed 
at the Margaret Morrison Division 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology and are settling right down to 
work. The moving spirit in the or­
ganization of this work is Miss Mar-
geurite Spilman, and girls wishing to 
join these classes may do so upon
application to Miss Spilmon's office, M|ss Dorotllv Belleville of the

entries that has ever been received 
for a track and field meet: Over four 
hunded and fifty teams have sent 
word that they will compete on Fri­
day and Saturday, April ^5 and 20, 
on Franklin Field. Harvard, Prince­
ton, Cornell, Columbia, Dartmouth, 
Mass. Inwt. of Teohnoloby, Pitts­
burgh, Chicago, Missouri, Notre 
Dame, Iowa State, Kansas, Wisconsin, 
Michigan, and in fact over 120 col­
iege teams are on the list. The reg­
ular relay championships should be 
sensational races while all the spe­
cial events will be up to the highest 
standards of track and fiGld athletics. 
A feature of the meet lies In the 
fact that all the Eastern and Western 
Intercollegiate Champions now in col­
lege will bo found in one or other of 
the events. In addition, many other 
star athletes will compete either in 
the relay championships or In the 
special events. Some of the great 
athletes with their records are as 
follows: Johnson of Michigan, West­
ern Champion in both hurdles and 
broad jump, who in credited with the 
longest Jump in 1918, namely 23 feet 
11% Inches, and who is also the in­
door Western Champion in the 50 
yard dash and high jump; Larsen of 
Brigham Young, 0 feet 5% inches, in 
high Jump; Newsletter and Landers, 
of Pennsylvania; Graham of Chicago, 
Myers of Dartmouth, all of whom 
have cleared 12 feet 10 Inches in 
pole vault; Sol. Butler, of Dubuque, 
with a record of 24 feet 2% inches 
in broad jump; Shea, of Pittsburgh, 
who has done 47 3-5 seconds for the 
440 yards; Thomson of Dartmouth, 
the American hurdle champion, with 
a record of 14 4-5 seconds for thg 
high hurdles; Dresser, of Cornell, 
with a two mile record of 9 minutes 
22 seconds; Smith, of Cornell, who 
has done 15 1-5 seconds for the high 
hurdles, and Erdman, of Princeton, 
with a similar record; MeCosh, of 
Chicago, mile runher, who has done 
4 minutes 22 seconds for (lie dis­
tance; Shaw, of Columbia, the ha.j. 
mile champion; Wetherdon, of New 
York University, who has cleared 0 
leel 2i inches hr the high jump and 
literally scores of other great ath­letes.
The attention or the general public 
is especially called to the fact that 
the first day of the meet co In no 
sense preliminary to the second. All 
the ('vents started on Friday arc 
finished on that day and some of 
them are among the most interesting 
of the entire carnival. The Penthnth-

ships have attracted wonderful en­
tries and will he features of «lie en

to bo present on both days. The 
carnival does not start until 2:30 on 
Friday and the most Important events

National Research Fellowships in 
Physics and Chemistry Supported
by the Rockefeller Foundation.
The National Research Council 
has been entrusted by the Roekefel 
ler Foundation with the expenditure 
of an appropriation of $500,OOO with­
in a period of five years for promot­
ing fundamental research In physics 
and chemistry in educational institu­
tions in the United States.
The primary feature of the project 
is the initiation and maintenance of 
a system of National Research Fel­
lowships, which are to be awarded 
by the National Research Council' to 
persons who have demonstrated a 
high order of ability in research, for 
the purpose of enabling them to con­
duct Investigations at educational in­
stitutions which make adequate pro­
vision for effective prosecution of re­
search in physics or chemistry. The 
plan will include such supplementary 
features as may promote the broad 
purpose of the project and increase 
Its efficiency.
Among the important results which 
are expected to follow from the exe­
cution of the plan may be mentioned: 
(1) Opening of a scientific career 
to a larger number of able investiga­
tors and their more thorough training 
in research, thus meeting an urgent 
need of our universities and indus­
tries. (2) Increase of knowledge 
in regard to the fundamental princi­
ples of physics and chemistry, upon 
which the progress of all the sciences, 
and the development of industry de­
pend. (3) Creation of more favora­
ble conditions for research in the 
.educational institutions of this coun­
try.
The appointments of national re­
search fellows will be made only after 
careful consideration of the scientific 
attainments of all candidates, not 
only of those who apply on their own 
Initiative, but also of those who are

PLAYING THE GAME
If everybody will put their shoulder 
to the wheel, clean-up day will be re. 
membered for many months. But, in 
order that this will not be a failure, it 
is necessary fori everybody to help. 
When classes are dismissed, do not 
sneak away, but get into the spirit of 
the thing and help make it go. Don't 
be a piker or a quitter. Be a man. 
You will do some work, but have a 
good time, too. Free Jazz that even­
ing.

Let us not at tills time ignore the 
policy of preparedness. After every 
war the pendulum or public opinion 
swings to the other extreme and 
peace pursuits are advocated, and as 
a consequence the nation finds Itself 
unprepared in time of stress to rap­
idly mobilize and train recruits. The 
idea of the R. O. T. C. is to combine 
with the student’s academic and en­
gineering training enough of the 
principles of military science and tac­
tics to enable him to rapidly assimi­
late the conglomeration of detail to 
time of war.
The principles of military science 
and tactics are all based on the 
fundamental principles of mathematics 
and engineering. Only about twenty 
per cent or engineering graduates 
pursue their specialized subject. Due 
to this tact educational authorities 
are endeavoring to make the courses 
in engineering more general. A 
number of colleges at present have 
the same curriculum for the first two 
years of the courses in civil, mechan­
ical and electrical engineering. The 
technical principles, of military 
science are tho same as those of en­
gineering. Tho application of those 
principles Is the Interesting part, of 
tho reserve officer’s training. Duo 
to tho fact that tho more general tho 
education becomes the more oppor­
tunities the Individual will have to 
succeed along any lino, l advocate 
the elementary training in military 
science for tho benefit of tho indi­
vidual as well as of tho government.
The normal technical college stu­
dent should have no difficulties in 
mastering tho subjects presented in
