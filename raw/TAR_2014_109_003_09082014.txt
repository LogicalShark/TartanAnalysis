CMU launches global brain initiative
BRADEN KELNER
Editor-in-Chief
Carnegie Mellon is looking 
to ?nd out how the brain af-
fects human behavior through 
its latest initiative, BrainHub.
On Aug. 26, the university 
announced the launch of Brai-
nHub during a discussion with 
faculty and research partners. 
The university stated in a press 
release that it will work with a 
variety of home and interna-
tional partners to create tools 
to study how the brain and hu-
man behavior are linked.
The initiative aims to bring 
insight into a variety of areas 
related to the brain, including 
cognition, learning and per-
ception, and brain disorders 
like Parkinson’s disease, ac-
cording to the release.
“As an initiative, [Brain-
Hub] seeks to link people who 
are connected with different 
parts of campus who may or 
may not in some cases have 
been previously engaged in 
research related to neurosci-
ence, brain science — to try 
and bring their expertise to 
bear on questions that are 
relevant to brain function,” 
said Nathan Urban, interim 
provost and Dr. Frederick A. 
Schwertz distinguished pro-
fessor of life sciences.
For example, a person in-
terested in engineering may 
be applying a data analysis 
process in an electrical engi-
neering context, but may be 
able to apply that process to 
answer questions about the 
brain, Urban said.
Key ?rst steps of the initia-
tive will be to develop better 
tools for recording neuron ac-
tivity and properties, as well 
as computational tools and 
approaches for better analyz-
ing and understanding the 
link between what the brain 
is doing at a speci?c time as it 
yields various behaviors, ac-
cording to the release.
“The belief is that there 
are people at Carnegie Mel-
lon who have developed these 
kinds of technologies in one 
application area, and we want 
to understand how they can 
be leveraged in another appli-
cation area,” Urban said.
As part of the initiative, 
Carnegie Mellon said univer-
sity deans plan to recruit 10 
or more new faculty members 
specializing in the brain sci-
ences in various departments 
and “establish new sources of 
ongoing support for gradu-
ate students and postdoctoral 
fellows,” according to the re-
lease.
To jumpstart the new ini-
tiative, Carnegie Mellon has 
secured $75 million of ini-
tial commitments over the 
next ?ve years from various 
funders, including the Hill-
man Foundation, RK Mellon 
Foundation, Dietrich Founda-
tion, and Kris Gopalakrish-
nan, the co-founder of busi-
ness consulting company 
Infosys, among others. 
The National Institutes 
of Health and the National 
Science Foundation also rep-
resent a large portion of the 
funding, according to Urban.

Although many students 
grieved at the loss of the Pan-
ther Hollow Inn, a local bar, 
over the summer, they may 
now have something else to 
look forward to: Winthorpe 
Valentine, LP, which bought 
4611 Forbes Ave. after it was 
sold last year, has ?led plans 
with the Department of City 
Planning to put a Chipotle 
Mexican Grill in the former 
bar’s location.
Chipotle Mexican Grill, 
which last year celebrated its 
25-year anniversary, serves a 
variety of Mexican-inspired 
foods, including tacos and 
burritos.
It was announced in May 
2013 that Panther Hollow 
Inn, known by most students 
as PHI, would close after the 
end of the spring 2014 se-
mester. Winthorpe Valentine, 
LP bought PHI from former 
owner Eugene DePasquale in 
June 2014 for $850,000; the 
bar closed for the last time in 
the early hours of June 1.
When it was announced 
that PHI was closing last 
year, The Tartan reported, 
students mourned the loss 
of what then-Student Body 
President Will Weiner (DC 
‘13) called “one of the few 
unique CMU hangout spots.” 
Within days, students had 
garnered 750 signatures on a 
change.org petition to keep 
PHI open.
Some students, however, 
welcome the change.
“I’m all for it,” said Jamie 
Rupert, a senior decision sci-
ence major. “The only thing 
is that PHI was small. I hope 
they’re planning to add more 
space.”
According to the ?led 
plans, the restaurant will 
open for business on Jan. 1, 
2015, after a period of con-
struction that began over a 
month ago, on Aug. 1. The 
plans include a new sec-
ond ?oor area, part of a 
725-square-foot addition to 
the space, and various reno-
vations to the walls, ?oor, 
and bathroom of the 
building.
Other students are more 
ambivalent.
“There’s already a Chipot-
le 30 seconds from my house, 
so it doesn’t really matter 
for me,” said Brian Lee, a ju-
nior economics and statistics 
major.
Vira Shao, a junior Chi-
nese studies and psychology 
double major, had her doubts 
about the upcoming Chipo-
tle. “I’m happy I don’t have 
to walk all the way down to 
Chipotle, but I’m pretty am-
bivalent,” Shao said. “Here’s 
one thing: I think that from a 
business standpoint, they’re 
making a very poor choice. 
Because yes, that Chipotle 
will recoup a lot of money re-
ally, really quickly, but alco-
hol sells more. And they’re 
going to have to renovate the 
hell out of that place because 
it’s a franchise. You can’t just 
have Chipotle food in a PHI-
esque bar; it doesn’t work like 
that.”
Jeremy Applebaum, a 
junior chemistry major, al-
though he said he, too, was 
ambivalent on the issue, 
hesitated to embrace the new 
Chipotle. 
“It’s just going to encour-
age CMU students to be re-
ally lazy and never leave the 
area. At least encourage them 
to walk ?ve minutes down 
Forbes to get Chipotle,” Ap-
plebaum said.
The Chipotle at 4611 
Forbes will join several oth-
er locations, including one 
in Oakland at 3619 Forbes 
Ave., another in East Liberty 
at 5986 Centre Ave., and 
one in Shadyside at 4800 
Baum Blvd.

Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon an-
nounced last Wednesday that 
the university has selected 
an architectural ?rm to de-
sign the gateway building 
for the new David A. Tepper 
Quadrangle. The Santa Mon-
ica-based ?rm Moore Ruble 
Yudell Architects & Planners 
have been commissioned to 
design the building, part of a 
large expansion of campus.
The building was described 
in a university press release as 
being 295 thousand square 
feet and located on a 4.5 acre 
plot on Forbes Avenue.
Robert Dammon, dean of 
the Tepper School of Business, 
described the building as one 
which “will house not just the 
Tepper school, but a number 
of university-wide activities,” 
explaining that, “the idea is 
to try and provide an environ-
ment that draws faculty and 
students in from all across 
campus” for both social and 
intellectual connections.
Dammon emphasized the 
presence of “collaborative 
spaces” for students, and said 
that this building and the an-
ticipated four or ?ve addition-
al buildings planned for the 
Tepper Quadrangle are “going 
to promote innovation and 
entrepreneurship at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
Bob Reppe, Director of 
Design for Carnegie Mellon, 
framed the Tepper Quadran-
gle as being part of the univer-
sity’s overall expansion. “The 
idea is as we grow campus 
across Forbes, we will be cre-
ating a gateway,” Reppe said. 
He added that Forbes is to be 
“the main street of campus,” 
and the new building will help 
with “moving Tepper from the 
edge of campus to the center 
of campus.”
The Tepper Quadrangle 
will be where the Morewood 
parking lot is currently lo-
cated, and is being funded by 
a $67 million donation from 
David Tepper’s charitable or-
ganization, $201 million of 
university money, and various 
other smaller donations. At 
the time of the donation, Tep-
per said in a university press 
release, “CMU has a long his-
tory of providing the world 
with innovative thinkers and 
the establishment of a true 
hub for entrepreneurship will 
help create the next genera-
tion of global leaders.”
Dammon recalled that the 
Quadrangle is “something 
that the Tepper school has 
been trying to do for a num-
ber of years now.” Talks be-
gan under previous dean Ken 
Dunn around 2007, according 
to Dammon. “Finally we’re 
able to put together the major 
sources of support,” Dammon 
explained, referencing the 
donation from David Tepper, 
support from the university, 
and fundraising efforts.
The gateway building will 
contain an entrepreneur-
ship center, a Technology En-
hanced Learning facility from 
the Eberly Center, a new din-
ing space, ?tness center, a 600 
-seat auditorium — making it 
the largest on campus — as 
well as a university welcome 
center. The building will also 
of?cially house the Simon Ini-
tiative. “President Suresh … 
believes that we need a wel-
come center located promi-
nently on Forbes Ave,” Repp 
said.
Dammon said that the 
building “will allow us to 
increase the size of our un-
dergraduate business pro-
gram,” from the current en-
tering freshman class of 85 to 
around 140 students by 2018.
Many have raised concerns 
about parking availability in

President Subra Suresh 
announced to the cam-
pus community via email 
on Friday that the univer-
sity is launching a search 
for provost and a marketing 
and communications vice 
president.
Currently, Nathan Urban, 
Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz 
distinguished professor of life 
sciences, holds the position 
of interim provost. 
The provost is the univer-
sity’s chief academic of?cer 
that reports directly to the 
president. 
The provost plays an im-
portant role in developing 
cross-departmental collabo-
ration, linking the univer-
sity’s campuses, and inter-
facing with global partners, 
according to the email.
A search advisory commit-
tee was created — led by Far-
nam Jahanian, vice president 
for research, and Michael 
Murphy, vice president for 
campus affairs — with a goal 
of making the ?nal appoint-
ment in the spring and a start 
date for the new provost of 
July 1, 2015.
President Suresh also said 
that Thomas Mattia, a senior 
executive at public relations 
?rm Edelman, will serve as in-
terim marketing and commu-
nications vice president until 
the search is complete. Based 
upon recommendations dur-
ing President Suresh’s listen-
ing tours, Carnegie Mellon 
worked with Edelman for the 
company to provide recom-
mendations to the university 
for strengthening its brand 
and communications, ac-
cording to the email. Edel-
man recommended that the 
university create this new 
position, which many other 
research universities already 
have.
The vice president will 
oversee all marketing and 
communications at Carnegie 
Mellon, a function that is cur-
rently run by the university’s 
Advancement division, ac-
cording to the email. 
President Suresh said 
moving the function will al-
low the Advancement divi-
sion to focus more on “fun-
draising and global alumni 
engagement.”
President Suresh announces leadership searches
Global learning conference meets at CMU
The Global Learning 
Council met face-to-face for 
the ?rst time on Sept. 4–5 
at Carnegie Mellon and the 
University of Pittsburgh.
The Global Learning 
Council, which is chaired 
by Carnegie Mellon Presi-
dent Subra Suresh, was an-
nounced in tandem with 
the Simon Initiative in No-
vember 2013 to coordinate 
stakeholders across various 
areas such as education and 
business to promote learn-
ing through technology, ac-
cording to Carnegie Mellon’s 
homepage.
During its ?rst meeting, 
the council identi?ed two ar-
eas of action for the council 
to improve technology-based 
learning, posted to the coun-
cil’s website.
The ?rst action item in-
cludes creating criteria and 
evidence for best learning 
practices in the “design of 
learning environments,” 
“continuous improvement,” 
and “adoption of new meth-
ods and technologies,” ac-
cording to the post. The 
action item responds to a 
problem identi?ed by the 
council: Educators do not 
have trusted sources to 
promote learning through 
technology.
For its second action item, 
the council aims to create a 
way to share “learning data” 
to combat the fact that or-
ganizations gather large 
amounts of data for sharing 
purposes, but do not have a 
standard way for sharing it.
The council plans to pres-
ent a draft of a document de-
tailing these action items in 
the spring to the Association 
of American Universities and 
the Association of Public and 
Land Grant Universities, ac-
cording to the council’s web-
site.

Oxford University’s Interna-
tional Brain Mechanics and 
Trauma Lab and the Indian 
Institute of Science, which has 
a brain institute initiative of its 
own, according to the Carn-
egie Mellon release. Carnegie 
Mellon will also work with 
long-time collaborators at the 
University of Pittsburgh.
In 2011, Carnegie Mellon 
partnered with Sun-Yat-sen 
University to create a joint 
graduate and engineering 
program, the Joint Institute of 
Engineering in China. Carn-
egie Mellon and Sun Yat-sen 
celebrated the launch of the 
program in late 2012. In July, 
Carnegie Mellon signed a 
memorandum of understand-
ing with the University of 
Warwick for a $10 million col-
laboration in data collection, 
analysis, and processing.
Urban said the short-term 
goals of the partnerships are 
to identify common areas of 
interest to develop further.
“There was a strong desire 
to have mechanisms for estab-
lishing these kinds of [connec-
tions among universities] and 
creating these kinds of joint 
projects, and we want to let 
the faculty who are engaged 
in this, drive that in terms of 
what directions they take,” 
Urban said.
Carnegie Mellon’s move to 
create new tools and methods 
to further study the brain is 
part of a larger trend of uni-
versity research regarding the 
brain. In April 2013, Presi-
dent Barack Obama unveiled 
the Brain Research through 
Advancing Innovative Neuro-
technologies (BRAIN) Initia-
tive, a government initiative 
to better understand the mind 
and uncover new ways to cure, 
prevent, and treat brain disor-
ders. As part of the initiative, 
the government said it would 
provide approximately $100 
million in investments through 
various government organiza-
tions for scientists to acquire 
needed tools for research.
In response to the initia-
tive, many universities have 
begun their own brain re-
search initiatives. 
For example, the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego 
in May 2013 introduced the 
Center for Brain Activity Map-
ping to develop new tools for 
recording the activities of neu-
rons in the brain and to con-
duct brain-mapping experi-
ments. 
In June, the state of Cali-
fornia provided $2 million 
in funding from its $156 mil-
lion 2014-15 state budget to 
jumpstart the university’s re-
search in brain-mapping. The 
funding was California’s ?rst 
allocation from a statewide re-
search grant program known 
as the California Blueprint for 
Research to Advance Innova-
tions in Neuroscience (Cal-
BRAIN). Cal-BRAIN is a direct 
response by the state of Cali-
fornia to President Obama’s 
initiative.
Urban said that Carnegie 
Mellon’s BrainHub initiative is 
unique from other university 
initiatives because of Carn-
egie Mellon’s international 
partnerships and its focus on 
drawing upon people in vari-
ous disciplines.
“There’s a lot of focus for 
us in trying to bring in people 
who are from, say, computer 
science or engineering into the 
fold. We really think ... there’s 
a lot of opportunity for push-
ing the ?eld forward rapidly 
by bringing new approaches, 
new technologies, [and] new 
tools to bear, Urban said.
Moore Rubele Yudell selected to design Tepper Quadrangle
BrainHub to bring together brain researchers, universities
BRAIN, from A1
light of the fact that the Tep-
per Quadrangle will be built 
over the current Morewood 
Gardens parking lot. Ralph 
Horgan, associate vice presi-
dent for Campus Design & 
Facility Development, how-
ever, assured, “there will be 
250-space parking structure 
under the building.”
Moore Ruble Yudell de-
scribes themselves as an of-
?ce of sixty people, whose 
past projects include build-
ings for Dartmouth University 
and the University of Califor-
nia Berkeley.
Buzz Yudell, partner at 
Moore Ruble Yudell, said that 
designing the new Tepper 
building is “signi?cantly dif-
ferent” from other university 
projects he’s worked on. “You 
don’t often ?nd campuses 
when they’re at this pivotal 
moment,” Yudell said. “From 
a planning view, it’s not just 
about a single building.”
According to Horgan, 
Moore Ruble Yudell was se-
lected because of the ?rm’s 
design expertise and its “spe-
ci?c experience with respect 
to cutting-edge business insti-
tutes.” Horgan added that the 
group was “very impressive in 
their organization.”
In addition to their core 
team, Moore Ruble Yudell is 
collaborating with an assem-
bled team of consultants for 
this project, ranging from en-
gineering ?rms to landscaping 
designers.
Dammon explained, “There 
was a level of comfort with 
them that we didn’t have en-
tirely with the other archi-
tects,” saying, “to be honest 
with you, they were the per-
fect choice.”
The building will be LEED 
Gold certi?ed, and is expected 
to be completed in fall 2018. 
Horgan remarked that “these 
buildings take a long time,” 
and that utilities will be laid 
next May. Construction on the 
building’s foundation will be-
gin the following May.
Reppe indicated that there 
will be “outreach sessions in 
preparation for our permitting 
and construction process.”
The new building is still in 
the design phase, but Yudell 
emphasized that Carnegie 
Mellon’s aspirations for the 
Tepper School “are fundamen-
tal to the planning.”

ROHAN VARMA
Assistant SciTech Editor
Oftentimes, analyzing a 
large system by only look-
ing at its individual parts is a 
hopeless task. 
For example, in team 
sports, individual players 
might not seem to be acting 
rationally in the moment; 
however, over time, the ac-
tions make a lot more sense 
in the context of the general 
strategy of the team. With this 
approach in mind, Byron M. 
Yu, assistant professor of elec-
trical and computer engineer-
ing, and John P. Cunningham, 
a professor at Columbia Uni-
versity, have developed a new 
strategy to utilize big data 
techniques to help better un-
derstand the complex neuro-
nal network in our brains.
In a University press re-
lease, Yu said, “One of the 
central tenets of neurosci-
ence is that large numbers 
of neurons work together to 
give rise to brain function. 
However, most standard ana-
lytical methods are appropri-
ate for analyzing only one 
or two neurons at a time. To 
understand how large num-
bers of neurons interact, ad-
vanced statistical methods, 
such as dimensionality re-
duction, are needed to inter-
pret these large-scale neural 
recordings.”
Current neuroscience re-
search methods are trying to 
locate and analyze signi?cant 
neurons and try and gain 
insight into the entire sys-
tems behavior through these 
individuals. 
However, oftentimes there 
is a lot of noise in the data be-
cause the neurons display lots 
of behavior that is hard to un-
derstand within the scope of 
one single neuron.
Unfortunately, solving this 
problem is not as easy as sim-
ply looking at more neurons 
at a time. 
By scaling the investiga-
tion from a single neuron 
to a population of neurons, 
having too much data starts 
to become a problem. There 
is so much data from neuro-
nal systems with thousands 
of neurons that it is hard to 
sift through it to get the im-
portant information. This is 
why computational big data 
techniques can provide large 
advances to this ?eld.
The speci?c technique that 
Yu and his team used is known 
as dimensionality reduction. 
This is a technique used to 
simplify the many variables 
in a large system to a smaller 
set of explanatory variables. 
In the case of neuroscience, 
the number of variables is 
the number of neurons in the 
system. 
The method is employed 
to characterize many of the 
neurons together so that they 
can be described by a fewer 
set of explanatory variables. 
This works because, while the 
actions of individual neurons 
is hopelessly complicated, 
simpler organizing principles 
may exist in the population as 
a whole.
Dimensionality reduction 
is already being used to help 
understand neuronal sys-
tems. As written in Yu’s paper 
that is published in Nature, a 
group studying a motor sys-
tem was able to successfully 
employ the technique. The

As the study of neurosci-
ence becomes increasingly 
prevalent in modern society, 
we are just beginning to un-
derstand the many complexi-
ties of the brain, namely its 
highly adaptable nature. Re-
searchers from the Center 
for the Neural Basis of Cog-
nition (CNBC), a joint Carn-
egie Mellon and University of 
Pittsburgh project, have ex-
plored this aspect of the brain 
through their research involv-
ing neuron response to rapid 
sequences of images.
Carl Olson, a professor of 
biological sciences at Carn-
egie Mellon and a member 
of the CNBC; Travis Meyer, 
a research associate of neu-
roscience at the CNBC; and 
Christopher Walker and Ray-
mond Cho of the department 
of psychiatry at the University 
of Pittsburgh examined how 
neurons react to familiar and 
unfamiliar images presented 
in rapid succession.
The researchers showed 
animal and human subjects 
rapid sequences of familiar 
and unfamiliar images and 
monitored the electrical re-
sponses of various individual 
neurons in the inferotemporal 
cortex, a section of the brain 
that is crucial for recognizing 
objects, to determine wheth-
er the inferotemporal cortex 
neurons followed the rapidly 
changing images better when 
the images were familiar or 
unfamiliar.
The researchers ultimately 
found that subjects’ neurons 
responded much more strong-
ly and selectively when shown 
familiar images in rapid suc-
cession than when shown 
unfamiliar images in rapid 
succession. The research also 
showed that the strong re-
sponse for familiar images was 
more prevalent in inhibitory 
neurons — neurons that calm 
the brain and restore balance 
— than in excitatory neurons 
— neurons that stimulate the 
brain. “You wouldn’t expect 
there to be such deep chang-
es in the brain from simply 
making things familiar,” said 
Olson in a university press re-
lease. “We think this may be a 
mechanism the brain uses to 
track a rapidly changing visual 
environment.”
In previous research, it 
was established that a sub-
ject’s neurons respond more 
strongly when shown a single 
unfamiliar image than when 
shown a single familiar image. 
The CNBC study, however, 
was focused on rapid series of 
images — not a singular image 
— which explains the differ-
ence in the results.
The concept that repeated 
viewing of an image causes 
neurons to respond to it in a 
weaker manner is called the 
familiarity effect. In the CNBC 
study, researchers noted that 
this effect could be bene?cial, 
not detrimental. The research-
ers explained that familiariza-
tion occurs in the form of a 
truncation. In other words, the 
neuron response is not weaker 
overall; it is simply truncated 
early for familiar images. The 
study suggests that this trun-
cation could make the neuron 
response more selective and 
could allow the neurons to be 
more prepared to respond to 
ensuing images.
Overall, the researchers 
concluded that image famil-
iarization improved the dy-
namics of the neuron response 
in the inferotemporal cortex. 
They suggest that each image 
triggers a speci?c subset of 
neurons that respond to cer-
tain aspects of that image and 
that the enhanced response 
for familiar images could be 
part of the brain’s mechanism 
for monitoring visual environ-
ments that are swiftly chang-
ing. They also note that the 
presence of an enhanced re-
sponse in excitatory neurons 
is important because it sug-
gests that the enhanced effect 
could be transmitted from the 
inferotemporal cortex to other 
areas of the brain.
The research was funded 
by the National Institutes of 
Health’s National Eye Insti-
tute and the National Institute 
of Mental Health, as well as 
the Pennsylvania Department 
of Health’s Commonwealth 
Universal Research Enhance-
ment Program. The study, 
titled “Image familiarization 
sharpens response dynamics 
of neurons in inferotemporal 
cortex,” is published online by 
Nature Neuroscience.

PUGWASH COLUMNZMapp distribution is debated
SKYE TOOR
Special to The Tartan
The recent Ebola outbreak 
was as much of a shock to 
medicine as it was to political 
discussion. ZMapp, the highly 
experimental drug developed 
by Mapp Biopharmaceutical 
Inc. and tested in monkeys, 
is the only known combatant 
to the disease. According to 
an article in USA Today, 100 
percent of monkeys in a Ca-
nadian study were cured of 
Ebola after being treated with 
ZMapp. 
However, just because we 
have a drug doesn’t mean we 
have a de?nite cure. In total, 
seven doses of ZMapp have 
been given to humans; out of 
these seven, two did not sur-
vive — a Liberian doctor and 
a Spanish priest. In hindsight, 
ZMapp is not a fully viable 
cure — or even treatment — 
for Ebola. Although it worked 
in monkeys, ZMapp alone 
cannot sustain humans for 
certain. 
Without having had any 
human trials, was it right to 
give that drug out? What does 
this say about American-fund-
ed medication? Is it our re-
sponsibility to distribute what 
we know or save our own? 
Here’s what a few Carnegie 
Mellon students think.
When we were ?rst learn-
ing about AIDS, or GRID 
(Gay-Related Immune De-
?ciency, later Gay Residual 
Immune Disorder) as it was 
called at the time, a group of 
scientists went to Africa to 
collect data and perform a 
few experiments. The experi-
ments were unsuccessful, but 
the data that was brought 
back helped form the next 
10 years of AIDS research. Is 
obtaining useful data worth 
risking the health of others? If 
a disease is fatal, does testing 
create any risk at all?
There are three options: 
We can give this drug to 
Americans and collect data, 
we can give this drug to west 
Africans and collect data, or 
we can do nothing. The social 
implications of each option 
are enormous. If the drug 
works and we try to keep it in 
the United States, the head-
lines could read “Western life 
comes ?rst: Ebola drug to be 
kept in U.S.,” and both U.S.-
based drug companies and 
the United States itself lose 
credibility as a foreign power. 
If we keep it in the United 
States but the drug doesn’t 
work, nothing happens. If the 
drug works and we take it to 
Africa, the press is good — 
but if the drug doesn’t work, 
and we take it to Africa, the 
headlines could read “Af-
rica as U.S. guinea pig: U.S. 
pharma to start human trials 
on Africans,” and the U.S. not 
only loses credibility, but is 
no longer welcome in many 
foreign markets. Ultimately, 
though, if we do nothing in 
the event of an outbreak, the 
implications are more than 
just social. A public distrust 
of the Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) is less of 
a concern than any idea that 
science no longer deserves 
funding. A world where scien-
tists fail to produce a perfect 
solution is much better than 
a world where scientists can 
no longer receive suf?cient 
funding because businesses, 
venturists, and agencies think 
that even when the scienti?c 
community is funded, it is too 
insular to share its ?ndings. 
The impact of doing nothing 
is actively harmful to the fu-
ture of science funding: No 
action now could leave the 
possibility of action in the fu-
ture at risk.

HOW THINGS WORKTattoos are inflammations 
BROOKE KUEI
SciTech Editor
If you’re thinking about 
getting a tattoo, you might 
want to learn about the sci-
ence behind the art before 
you make your ?nal decision. 
While on the outside, a tattoo 
is a beautiful and symbolic 
creation, on the inside, it is ac-
tually the result of a perpetual 
in?ammatory process.
Tattoos have been used as 
a form of self-expression for 
millennia. According to neu-
roscientist Claudia Aguirre in 
a TED-Ed video titled “What 
makes tattoos permanent?”, 
the earliest evidence of body 
ink was found on a Peruvian 
mummy from 6,000 BCE. 
To add even more history to 
this tradition, the tattoo ma-
chine was invented in the late 
1800s, its design based on 
Thomas Edison’s engraving 
machine.
Today, one look around 
campus can reveal a variety 
of different tattoo designs, 
colors, and types of people 
sporting them. With the in-
dependence of life at college, 
who’s to stop you from getting 
one, too?
Maybe all you care about 
is whether or not it will hurt, 
but there is a lot more that 
can be learned about the tat-
tooing process. Although hu-
mans shed 40,000 skin cells 
per hour, the TED-Ed video 
explains that tattoos remain 
permanent because they are 
not on the epidermis, but 
rather inside a second layer of 
skin: the dermis. 
A tattoo machine punc-
tures the skin continuously 
with a needle, depositing 
ink into the dermis, which is 
made up of collagen ?bers, 
nerves, glands, blood vessels, 
and more.
Whenever the needle 
penetrates the skin — which 
could be up to 3,000 times per 
minute — it causes a wound 
which alerts the body to be-
gin an in?ammatory war to 
?ght the intruding tattoo ink. 
White blood cells known as 
lymphocytes form the ?rst 
line of defense; however, most 
of the pigmentation particles 
are too large for them to ?ght. 
Next, a different type of white 
blood cell — macrophages — 
come in and eat up the pig-
mentation particles. Some of 
these macrophages will carry 
the dye back to the lymph 
nodes, but many will simply 
remain in the dermis — dye 
and all — forever suspend-
ing your angel wings, Chinese 
character, or lover’s name in 
the second layer of skin.
In addition to existing in-
side macrophages, some ink 
particles simply ?oat eter-
nally in the gel-like matrix of 
the dermis. Still, others are 
eaten by dermal cells called 
?broblasts, which remain in 
the dermis for their entire life 
cycles. Even when ?broblasts 
die, they get taken up by new 
dermal cells which hold both 
the old cell and the dye within 
it.
How, then, can tattoos be 
removed? According to Anne 
Laumann, professor of der-
matology at Northwestern 
University, the best method of 
tattoo removal is laser treat-
ment. In laser treatment, light 
targets a speci?c color and 
breaks up the ink particles 
of that color. By breaking up 
the ink particles, laser treat-
ment creates particles that 
are small enough to be carried 
away by white blood cells. Un-
fortunately, this method does 
not always remove the entire 
tattoo.
Besides the tattooing 
process and tattoo removal, 
there is also a science to the 
ink used for tattoos. Tradi-
tional pigments were made 
from ground up minerals and 
carbon black, but today’s pig-
ments can sometimes also 
include industrial organic 
pigments, vegetable-based 
pigments, or plastic-based 
pigments.
While the composition of 
your tattoo ink will inherent-
ly vary based on where you 
get your tattoo done, there 
are common compositions 
for various colors of ink. For 
example, black ink often in-
cludes carbon, logwood, or 
iron oxide; brown contains 
ochre; red has cinnabar (HgS) 
or cadmium red (CdSe), 
which are both known for tox-
icity. Consequently, it would 
be in your best interest to ask 
your tattoo artist about the 
chemicals they use in their 
inks to avoid allergic reac-
tions or phototoxic reactions.
It has often been said that 
science is an art, but the bio-
logical and chemical intrica-
cies behind tattoos suggests 
that art is a science, too.

Kids’ brains absorb majority of energy
Researchers at Northwest-
ern University have found 
that during childhood, the 
brain absorbs most of a kid’s 
energy. Since this leaves less 
energy for the rest of the body, 
compared to other animals, 
even other primates, human 
children take much longer to 
grow in body size.
Scientists have been con-
sidering this idea for decades, 
but were unable to come up 
with hard data to verify the 
theory. Positron emission to-
mography (PET) imaging, a 
method that estimates the 
brain’s energy consumption, 
is risky for use on children. 
Consequently, scientists used 
an older dataset of PET scans 
on 29 children who were sus-
pected of having a brain dis-
order at the time, but later 
turned out to be healthy. On 
plotting trends, the graphs 
indicated that the hypothesis 
of slow body growth due to 
energy consumption by the 
brain was indeed true.

Malaria diagnosed using magnets
Researchers at the Nan-
yang Technological University 
in Singapore have found that 
magnets can detect the pres-
ence of malaria before symp-
toms appear. 
When the technique was 
tested on mice, magnetic 
sensors were able to spot im-
perceptible levels of the ma-
laria parasites in a matter of 
minutes.
The device relies on the 
fact that red blood cells are 
magnetic due to the pres-
ence of hemoglobin, which is 
an iron-based protein. When 
malarial parasites enter the 
blood stream, they feed on 
the hemoglobin, converting 
it into nanocrystals called he-
mozoin, which boost the mag-
netization of the red blood 
cells, making it easy to detect 
the presence of the parasites.

Message transmitted between two brains
Scientists were able to use 
technology to allow the trans-
mission of messages between 
the brains of two people at a 
distance of 5,000 miles apart 
without performing any inva-
sive surgery.
Here’s how it worked. 
Electrodes were attached to 
the scalp of one subject to 
record the electrical currents 
in the brain while it had a 
speci?c thought. At the other 
end, a computer brain inter-
face was used to map a neural 
code for binary symbols, by 
making the subject perform 
a certain action for a one and 
a different one for a zero, and 
capturing the electrical sig-
nals from each using electro-
encephalography (EEG). The 
message from the sender was 
encoded into binary and sent 
to the recipient’s visual cortex 
as a string of ones and zeros 
in their peripheral vision. This 
binary string was then decod-
ed to get the actual words of 
the message.

Satellite can see through ?re smoke 
While mapping major ?res 
by satellite imaging is certain-
ly desirable, in practice, it has 
been hard to accomplish due 
to the smoke obscuring the 
?re. However, the new World-
View-3 satellite from the com-
pany Digital Globe has been 
equipped with high resolution 
short-wave infrared (SWIR) 
sensors that can remove most 
of the smoke from the image.
The SWIR sensor can 
detect up to eight differ-
ent wavelengths of infrared 
light, each of which has dif-
ferent advantages. While one 
wavelength can see through 
smoke, another can see man-
made materials more sharply. 
When the data from all eight 
wavelengths is combined, it 
reveals a detailed heat map of 
where the ?re is burning most 
intensely.

Low costs catalyze space tourism
Did you want to be an astro-
naut when you were younger? 
Well now, with the increasing 
prevalence of space tourism, 
you can ful?ll your dream for 
a low price of $75,000. World 
View Enterprise, a veteran 
space company, is develop-
ing high altitude balloons that 
can carry eight people and 
will be making trips to space 
by the end of 2015. The ?ve-
hour trip will give passengers 
a birds-eye view of the edges 
of Earth while they enjoy a 
meal and open bar.  While it is 
still in the test phases, there is 
already interest from people 
around the world. 
The space tourism indus-
try is one of the fastest grow-
ing luxury markets, increasing 
50% faster than the average 
luxury good. Considering 
that previous space tourism 
ventures have cost upwards 
of $50 million, the increas-
ing popularity can largely be 
attributed to the lower ticket 
prices.

Archer?sh found to be skillful hunter
Archer?sh, aptly named 
for their ability to shoot jets 
of water at insects perched 
on leaves and twigs above, 
have recently been found to 
be more skillful than previ-
ously thought. Stefan Schus-
ter and Peggy Gerullis of the 
University of Bayreuth in 
Germany trained archer?sh 
to hit targets ranging from 
20 to 60 centimeters high 
and observed the archer?sh 
in action. They found that 
the archer?sh actually made 
intricate adjustments to the 
cross-sections of their mouth 
openings to vary the projec-
tion of the water jets they 
were shooting out. This study 
was published in Current 
Biology on Sept. 4.

On-campus bar may be worthy of consideration
With the closing of Panther Hol-
low Inn (PHI), known by many 
Carnegie Mellon students as the uni-
versity’s unof?cial campus bar, the 
campus community is left without a 
nearby popular alcohol-serving es-
tablishment. 
This may be a larger issue than 
it initially seems, with the possibil-
ity of students having to travel as far 
as Oakland or Shadyside to socialize 
in an alcohol-friendly environment. 
Not only would walking to and at-
tending distant bars at night expose 
students to greater safety risks, it 
may dilute the sense of social com-
munity surrounding a nearby cam-
pus cultural institution like PHI.
Many peer universities have on-
campus pubs where students of le-
gal drinking age can convene in a 
regulated setting to socialize and 
enjoy a bar atmosphere. Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology’s (MIT) 
student-run Muddy Charles Pub, 
for example, prides itself on hous-
ing the networking conversations 
of students who have gone on to be 
Nobel laureates or prominent schol-
ars. Harvard University also has a 
student-owned and operated pub, 
the Cambridge Queen’s Head. With 
the closing of PHI, Carnegie Mellon 
lacks a similar locale for students 
of legal age to relax and socialize. 
The Tartan would like to encourage 
Carnegie Mellon to consider institut-
ing a similar on-campus pub.
There are concerns to be ac-
knowledged regarding the discus-
sion of having a campus bar. How-
ever, this may also be an opportunity 
for the university to establish a safer 
and more regulated facility for stu-
dent drinking.
 For instance, campus bars are 
traditionally strict about how in-
toxicated patrons can become, and 
Carnegie Mellon has enrollment 
data which contains students’ birth-
days. Using that data, false IDs can 
be detected, and the university can 
ensure that all attending students 
are 21 years or older and can enjoy 
alcohol in a responsible fashion.
Given that the many alternatives 
for students who wish to go to bars 
involve walking into the neighbor-
hoods surrounding campus, and 
drinking in institutions which may 
not police their patrons’ intoxication 
or interactions very thoroughly, stu-
dents could be exposed to a greater 
amount of risk now that PHI has 
closed.
A campus bar would be within a 
quick response distance for campus 
police and would be located in a safe 
and typically convenient area for 
members of the campus community. 
Now that PHI no longer exists, stu-
dents who wish to consume alcohol 
may do so more frequently in such 
settings as dorm and house parties. 
Needless to say, these environ-
ments are not regulated and may 
result in dangerous alcohol con-
sumption habits. Additionally, these 
settings don’t facilitate the same 
relaxed social setting and network-
ing opportunities that campus 
bars can provide. It might even be 
worthwhile to consider managing a 
campus bar as a valuable, practical 
opportunity for business or manage-
ment students.
This is not a proposal for the de-
velopment of a campus bar, but it is 
an idea that should be considered. 
The closing of PHI has left a notable 
gap in Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
culture. PHI was a close, safe place 
to grab a drink with friends and so-
cialize, and the role of pubs in net-
working for students and future 
scholars has been well-established, 
hence the presence of these institu-
tions on the campuses of universi-
ties like Harvard University and MIT. 
Carnegie Mellon should engage in a 
discussion to consider the possible 
bene?ts and drawbacks of a similar 
institution and determine whether 
pursuing such a project would be 
bene?cial.
U.S. must develop clear strategy for Middle East
JUSTIN YAN 
The Iraq War was a failure in con-
vincing Iraqis that the United States 
could save them from disorder in the 
form of dictatorship, poverty, and 
extremism.
The three threats are entangled, 
and though the ?rst has been some-
what alleviated through American 
efforts, the effects of dictatorship 
are still widely seen in the form of a 
disorganized and very partisan gov-
ernment. Moreover, 9/11 and the 
Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS) 
can be seen as reactions to Ameri-
can involvement in the region, as 
well as to multiple malfunctioning 
governments. Recent events, from 
the beheading of American journal-
ist Steven Sotloff to the unexpected 
re-capture of Mosul by Iraqi and 
Kurdish forces, underline the mag-
nitude of the volatility surrounding 
the terrorist group known as ISIS. 
Moreover, ISIS presents a unique 
conundrum to American foreign 
policy.
Fareed Zakaria, a well-known 
political analyst and former editor 
for Foreign Affairs, wrote an essay 
in the aftermath of 9/11 titled “Why 
do They Hate Us?” His essay begins 
its narration with the portrayal of 
America in the Middle East during 
the Cold War. Communism, personi-
?ed by Russia, never quite matched 
the mystical appeal of wealth and 
glory that the United States held 
during this era. How did this repu-
tation deteriorate in the span of less 
than 50 years?
First, the rise of oil and the 
wealth and power that came along 
with it destabilized the Middle 
East’s yearning for “modernization” 
associated with the United States. 
Due to the Gulf War and the United 
States’ eagerness to protect its oil 
sources, along with the oil barons 
who controlled the wealth output 
of the Middle East, modernization 
and Americanization became syn-
onymous with inequality and the 
marginalization of Saddam Hus-
sein dissenters, namely the Shiites. 
Moreover, as Hussein gained power, 
the people of Iraq ?ed from Ameri-
canization, thus creating the perfect 
environment for radical sentiment.
During the Iraq War, Iraqi senti-
ment toward the United States was 
mixed. Some praised America’s mili-
tary involvement, others criticized 
its ineffectiveness, while others still 
harbored anti-American sentiment 
that arose during the Gulf War and 
was exacerbated by Saddam Hus-
sein’s reign.
In the era after the Iraq War, the 
United States must come up with a 
comprehensive solution for dealing 
with ISIS and the corresponding 
humanitarian issues. As history tells 
us, every action the United States 
executes in the Middle East has a 
strong and often varied reaction, 
fueling a constant feedback system 
that makes the execution of a co-
herent and effective foreign policy 
even more complicated. American 
foreign policy in the Middle East is 
becoming the world’s most complex 
game of public relations. America 
wants to act as a stabilizing force, 
but without the overexertion of its 
own armed forces, as seen during 
the Iraq War.
One way the United States is 
accomplishing this maneuver is 
through the cooperation with Sunni 
forces. The reason for this relation-
ship is twofold. Not only will it show 
that the Americans can cooperate 
with both Shiites (who had until 
recently, dominated Iraqi politics, 
thanks to United States-backed 
Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Ma-
liki) and Sunni, but also coopera-
tion will cut off the supply of fresh 
recruits to Al Qaeda and ISIS, or 
any future splinter terrorist group 
who recruit young Sunni Muslims. 
The Shiites and Sunnis have been 
deadlocked in con?ict for decades. 
Sunnis dominate many countries in 
population, often forcing the Shiites 
to live impoverished and oppressed.
In Iraq, however, the opposite is 
true, and the fact that the United 
States allowed al-Maliki to install a 
Shiite-dominated government has 
further dented relations with the 
Sunnis. ISIS has won the support 
of the Sunni people, many of whom 
make up the bulk of its ?ghters, by 
appealing to “Sunni Pride.” The 
United States must do the same. The 
Obama Administration must ?gure 
out a way to help the Sunnis and en-
courage a new brand of nationalism 
removed from ISIS.
Currently, government forces in 
both Syria and Iraq are led by the 
Assad regime and Shia forces, nei-
ther of which holds any appeal for 
local Sunnis. As a result, the key to 
winning over the Sunni does not lie 
in rapid military success, but rather 
in winning on a cultural, ideological 
scale. 
By providing humanitarian and 
political support for the Sunni peo-
ple, as well as arming, training, and 
providing tactical support for the 
Sunni forces against ISIS, the United 
States may be able to tip the balance 
of power in Iraq.
The United States has already 
come too far to become a bystander 
with no clear plan of action in the 
ongoing Middle East crisis. The na-
tion must be the spark for dialogue 
and a change of the American image  
if it wants to protect its own inter-
ests, as well as provide a safe and 
stable environment in the Middle 
East.

Last Sunday, nude photographs 
leaked of several high-pro?le female 
celebrities, including Kirsten Dunst, 
Kate Upton, and Jennifer Lawrence. 
The perpetrators were hackers 
who had presumably taken advan-
tage of security vulnerabilities in 
Apple’s iCloud system. The knee-
jerk reaction of the public and main-
stream media has been to call this a 
“scandal.” However, the real scandal 
here is not that the pictures exist but 
that their leaking constitutes a gross 
violation of privacy and women’s au-
tonomy, as well as an unquestionable 
sex crime.
An encouraging number  of news 
outlets have spoken out in condem-
nation of the hackers and of the 
victim-blaming usually rampant in 
such cases. Many have jumped in 
with the not-so-helpful advice that 
these celebrities should simply “not 
take nudes,” thus solving all of their 
problems. Such arguments place 
the bulk of responsibility not on the 
criminals, but on the women exercis-
ing their legitimate right to express 
their sexuality however they wish 
and — on a practical level — to store 
personal photos in a place they ex-
pect to stay private.
The “don’t take nudes” argument 
is the virtual equivalent of “don’t 
wear short skirts” if you don’t want 
to be raped. In addition, as we have 
recently seen with the advent and 
viral phenomenon of “anti-rape nail 
polish,” buying special nail polish, 
dressing conservatively, and never 
taking suggestive photographs are 
hardly the secret to stopping the real 
perpetrators of sexual crime.
No person — celebrity or other-
wise — deserves to have their pri-
vacy so callously infringed upon. If 
someone wants to take nude photo-
graphs of their own free will and vo-
lition, that is their right. Conversely, 
if they don’t wish to take nude photo-
graphs, they are free to abstain. 
However, when the inevitable 
next round of photographs are 
leaked, and are known to be pub-
lished without the consent of their 
subjects, we should all take a mo-
ment to think.
By seeking out these photo-
graphs, by looking at them, we feed 
into the harmful societal practice 
wherein women’s bodies are com-
modi?ed. Instead, we must refuse to 
sacri?ce human dignity for the sake 
of cheap sexual grati?cation and 
a fast food-reminiscent hunger for 
scandal.

A PERSON’S OPINION
September 8, 2014 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
JUSTIN MCGOWN
Less than a year ago, Hunt Library 
received renovations that made its 
?rst ?oor a very welcoming place for 
students to work, study, and social-
ize. The renovations were immensely 
popular and showed a real under-
standing on the part of the univer-
sity toward the wants and needs of 
students. Alongside an initiative by 
library staff to be responsive to stu-
dent suggestions that drew praise 
from this publication, it rendered 
Hunt Library an attractive place.
If you have not yet been to Hunt, 
I recommend you do your best to 
remember that inviting open ?oor 
plan, the wide spaces, the dozens of 
desktop workstations, and the abil-
ity to see out both the front and back 
windows at the same time — because 
that has all been taken from you. The 
elimination of popular student spaces 
also extends to the second ?oor, 
where stacks displaced by the IDeATe 
construction have ?lled in the open 
areas where there were once tables, 
chairs, and groups of students doing 
work and having conversations.
As compensation, we have been 
given more silent study space on the 
third ?oor. Expect to wander up there 
while looking for printers, as the 
three given to us after the last round 
of renovations are gone, replaced by 
a single unit.
Of course there are some advan-
tages to the new renovations. The 
basement now has a collection of fab-
rication spaces — that are only open 
to those who complete semester-long 
intake courses. The basement also 
now has a room painted entirely 
black, which should alleviate the 
constant demand for motion capture 
or psychological torture spaces on 
campus. There is a pair of classrooms 
that you can sit quietly on the periph-
ery of until you determine if the guy 
writing on the whiteboard and talk-
ing loudly is teaching a class or just 
being obnoxious. Four of the com-
puters have also survived and been 
tucked into a cramped corner by the 
two remaining printers. One of them 
is situated so that only the person sit-
ting at the computer next door can 
see your screen, perfect for “studying 
human anatomy”!
The IDeATe program could be a 
useful addition to campus, though 
we won’t know for a few years when 
the ?rst people to graduate with the 
associated minors enter the job mar-
ket. But the administration needs to 
be roundly criticized for the way the 
renovations were handled. Re-reno-
vating a space that had only opened 
a matter of months ago is wasteful 
and inconsiderate of the planning be-
hind a student-centric space. While 
the facilities in the basement seem 
like overall useful additions, even 
with their limited accessibility to the 
larger student body, there is no clear 
reason why the ?rst-?oor classrooms 
needed to be constructed, especially 
when Baker Hall and Porter Hall have 
numerous classrooms that are show-
ing their age and either lack central 
air or rely on window air condition-
ing units that appear to be older 
than some students. The new Hunt 
classrooms do not offer anything that 
other classrooms do not and serve to 
detract from the utility of the library 
for many students.
The stealth with which the con-
struction was done is also concern-
ing, since this space popular with stu-
dents was completely reworked over 
the summer while students were not 
around. No of?cial emails went out to 
announce town halls or other forums 
for discussion of the changes; they 
simply happened. Were students con-
sulted about the renovations at all? It 
seems doubtful.
Two of?cial emails have contained 
reference to IDeATe. One of them, 
cosigned by Vice Provost for Design, 
Arts, and Technology Thanassis Rika-
kis and Dean of University Libraries 
Keith Webster says: “The placement 
of IDeATe’s student facilities in the 
Hunt Library re?ects a growing trend 
for academic libraries to expand 
from a focus on housing collections 
of books and journals to becoming a 
space where students come together 
to work with their peers, interact with 
technology, and access a range of me-
dia to create knowledge.” If they had 
bothered to ask, they would know we 
were already doing that without the 
aid of walls and a seemingly unneces-
sary reshuf?ing of content.

In a January issue of The Tartan, I 
wrote an article called “Fitness track-
ers more than just a trend.” I argued 
that ?tness trackers, like Fitbit’s line 
of wristbands and other wearable 
technologies, are here to stay and 
will become increasingly popular as 
makers round out their capabilities 
to include more functionality, such 
as the ability to respond to texts or 
speak through the devices. Since 
then, a number of device makers, 
including Samsung and Motorola, 
have announced or launched a vari-
ety of smartwatches and trackers.
Now, I’m writing again to say 
these devices are too much. After 
purchasing a Pebble smartwatch in-
November, at ?rst I enjoyed screen-
ing texts and calls on my wrist. I could 
continue conversations with friends 
in-person while simply ?icking my 
wrist to see incoming noti?cations. 
I could even check the number of 
steps I took through a downloadable 
pedometer with functions similar to 
a ?tness tracker, and scroll through 
my Twitter feed without ever pulling 
my phone out.
After a while, though, I found my-
self constantly checking my wrist as 
an in?ux of emails, text messages, 
and social media noti?cations went 
straight to my watch. I couldn’t read 
a page of a book ef?ciently or remain 
fully immersed in a conversation 
for more than a few minutes before 
my smartwatch called my attention. 
Eventually, I turned off the device’s 
bluetooth capabilities so that it only 
told the time. Nine months after I 
purchased the watch, it lies in my 
bedroom uncharged.
Smartwatches and other wear-
able technologies seem to have been 
developed with the idea that people 
will check their phones less if they 
integrate technology into their daily 
lives in less intrusive ways. After all, 
if a person doesn’t have to continu-
ally remove their phone from their 
pocket to check it and possibly re-
spond, they should be able to more 
seamlessly screen noti?cations to de-
termine if it is worth interrupting a 
daily activity for.
However, in my experience, these 
devices do just the opposite. By plac-
ing noti?cations on a person’s wrist, 
smartwatches and other wristband-
like technologies just make the dis-
tractions more accessible. They force 
people to feel the buzz of a noti?ca-
tion that they would not normally 
feel or take the time to check. With 
the noti?cation at the ready, though, 
there’s no reason not to check it. In-
stead of checking their cell phone 
periodically, people can look to their 
watch every time it buzzes. And if 
rumors of an imminent Apple iWatch 
announcement are true, it seems 
these devices will become a main-
stream trend this year — possibly 
even tomorrow — when the tech gi-
ant is set to announce new products 
at a press event.
To combat the distractions these 
devices offer, people must learn 
to limit the noti?cations pushed 
to them. It’s possible to customize 
which noti?cations go to the watch 
and which only go to the phone 
screen. 
While even limited noti?cations 
can be distracting, fewer pings to the 
wrist can help to keep people in their 
conversations and away from their 
noti?cations. If people limit their 
noti?cations to these devices, they 
can ensure their technology doesn’t 
become overwhelming.

Smartwatches detract from normal life

Corporate tax avoidance has 
become a trendy topic lately, with 
President Obama himself taking the 
time to speak out on the issue a few 
weeks ago. Recently, it was heavily 
publicized with Burger King corpo-
ration’s decision to merge with Tim 
Hortons Inc. and move the corpo-
rate headquarters of the new com-
bined company to Canada, rather 
than staying in Miami.
Many liberals, President Obama 
included, have criticized Burger 
King’s decision for demonstrating 
a lack of “economic patriotism,” of 
course implying that Burger King 
has some sort of duty to stay in the 
United States and compromise its 
pro?ts under a non-competitive 
corporate tax structure because the 
company just owes it to America. 
Unfortunately, what Obama forgets 
is that corporate executives don’t 
have a duty to act in the United 
States’ best interest, but in fact have 
a very different duty, called a ?du-
ciary duty. That’s a fancy way of say-
ing that corporate executives are le-
gally obligated to act in the interest 
of the corporations they work for. In 
fact, corporate executives can and 
have been convicted of crimes for 
not acting in the best interest of the 
shareholders of the corporation.
In other words, if Canada’s cor-
porate tax structure makes Burger 
King’s tax bill lower, and therefore 
makes it a more pro?table enter-
prise, not only is it a permissible 
action for the company to move, 
but it’s actually the company’s legal 
duty. Examining our corporate tax 
structure in comparison to Cana-
da’s, it becomes very clear that Burg-
er King’s decision to move its HQ to 
Canada was absolutely correct. 
The United States suffers from 
the highest corporate tax rate among 
industrialized countries, coming in 
at 39 percent. To put that in per-
spective, Canada’s corporate tax 
rate is 15 percent, which has vaulted 
Canada to the spot of sixth most eco-
nomically free country in the world, 
compared with the United States in 
the 12th spot and declining. The de-
cision to favor a freer economic tax 
structure wasn’t an unconscious one 
either. Canada and other countries 
are realizing that they can attract 
more business and investment by 
creating economic freedom. This 
creates more wealth for Canadians 
and makes the country better off.
When we look at the reasons for 
the United States’ high corporate 
tax rate, we can ?nd the answer in 
a few shocking statistics. General 
Electric regularly has a net posi-
tive tax bill, meaning that when all 
is said and done and the taxes are 
calculated, the government is writ-
ing GE a check, and not the other 
way around. Similarly, one in nine 
Standard & Poor 500 companies had 
a tax bill of $0 last year, and many 
more companies paid less than the 
39 percent that plagues corpora-
tions without the resources to lobby 
and create loopholes. Massive cor-
porations can use their resources 
to warp the tax code in their favor, 
a luxury smaller corporations don’t 
have.
Our egregious corporate tax 
structure only serves to further the 
aims of cronyism and it certainly 
runs counter to the aims of econom-
ic development. When corporations 
act on their ?duciary duties and 
eventually leave the United States 
for our more competitive neighbors, 
liberals can gripe about economic 
patriotism, but until we reform 
our corporate tax structure, empty 
words won’t bring back the prosper-
ity that America once enjoyed.

The summer soccer trans-
fer window of 2014 has ?nally 
slammed shut. Records were 
set by clubs for the amount of 
money spent, as the ?nancial 
superiority of the Barclays 
Premier League was at full 
display. 
The effects of the Union of 
European Football Associa-
tions’s (UEFA) new Financial 
Fair Play regulations were also 
seen, as the likes of Manches-
ter City, Paris Saint-Germain, 
and Chelsea signi?cantly 
curbed their spending from 
previous years to make up 
for previous losses. So which 
transfers were on paper the 
best of the summer? Which 
ones just do not seem right? 
And which ones were com-
plete shockers? Let’s take a 
look.
Best transfers
Chelsea must be given 
plaudits for its acquisition of 
striker Diego Costa and mid-
?elder Cesc Fàbregas. For 
years, since striker Didier 
Drogba left the club, Chelsea 
has lacked a go-to goal scorer, 
especially someone with the 
temperament and competitive 
spirit of current manager José 
Mourinho. 
In Costa they now have a 
striker who matches the likes 
of Cristiano Ronaldo and Lio-
nel Messi in scoring rate and 
someone who was instru-
mental in guiding his previ-
ous club, Atlético Madrid, to 
the La Liga title as well as the 
Champions League Final. His 
endless runs, prowess in the 
air, and inability to accept 
defeat is exactly what Chel-
sea lacked in its strikers, and 
Mourinho has done a good job 
to rectify that. 
Fàbregas has a style of play 
that perfectly complements 
defensive mid?elder Nemanja

Yesterday, the Pittsburgh 
Steelers took on the Johnny 
Footballs, also known as the 
Cleveland Browns, to open 
their 2014 campaign. After 
back-to-back disappointing 
8–8 ?nishes, the Steelers have 
hopefully ?nished the grow-
ing pains stemming from their 
recent major roster turnovers. 
Previously known as a veteran 
defense with an aging offen-
sive line, Pittsburgh has com-
pletely rebuilt its front seven 
on defense and focused on 
offensive talent in the draft, 
resulting in a young, energet-
ic team hoping to reverse old 
fortunes.
The biggest youth move-
ment has come in the line-
backing core with back-to-
back ?rst round picks Jarvis 
Jones and Ryan Shazier lead-
ing the rebuilt unit. Shazier 
has exceeded all expecta-
tions in training camp and is 
already garnering defensive 
rookie-of-the-year buzz be-
fore taking a single meaning-
ful snap. Jones showed ?ash-
es of his pass rush potential 
last year as he grew into the 
starting role, but is looking to 
avoid the sophomore slump 
and step up his pressure.
Another big switch is the 
replacement of 34-year-old 
safety Ryan Clark with former 
Carolina Panther Mike Mitch-
ell, who is entering his prime 
in his sixth season. Several of 
the Steelers’ issues came from 
the safety position last year, 
as both Clark and Troy Pola-
malu appeared to have lost 
a step, but attacked with the 
same aggressiveness they had 
in prior years. This risk-taking 
approach by both the players 
and defensive coordinator 
Dick LeBeau resulted in more

The tiny 16-game sample 
and parity of the NFL make 
for some fun randomness 
during the season, but each 
season there is only a hand-
ful of true contenders. Based 
on the level of talent on these 
four teams, I believe one of 
them will be holding the 
Vince Lombardi Trophy by 
the  season’s end.
Denver Broncos
The Denver Broncos were 
a very good team last season. 
Despite some of the feeling 
that they beat up on an easy 
AFC and cruised to the Super 
Bowl, they probably ?elded 
the best offense in the his-
tory of the league. Even in a 
high-scoring league, they still 
managed to lead the ?eld by a 
comfortable margin. The only 
players of note they lost from 
that offense were receiver 
Eric Decker and running back 
Knowshon Moreno. Decker 
was a product of quarterback 
Peyton Manning’s unbeliev-
able season, rather than a 
cause. Receiver Emmanuel 
Sanders has been produc-
tive for years in the Steelers 
offense and should replace 
Decker just ?ne. Considering 
the rest of his career, Moreno 
was also only productive due 
to Manning, and running 
back Montee Ball should ?ll 
the gap there after an ade-
quately solid season last year.
The defense, on the other 
hand, was atrocious last year. 
The front seven missed line-
backer Von Miller during his 
suspension at the beginning 
of the year and injury at the 
end of it. This team had some 
solid players, but no one tru-
ly good. Linebacker Danny 
Trevathan is out for the sea-
son, but the Broncos more 
than made up for him in the 
off-season. Defensive end 
DeMarcus Ware is a hall-of-
fame-level pass rusher and, 
should be productive for the 
Broncos even at the end of his 
career. Cornerback Aqib Talib 
was very good for the Patriots 
last year, and will probably 
continue to be so. The Bron-
cos already spun the score-
board, and with a true NFL-
level defense this year, other 
teams should watch out.
San Francisco 49ers
The San Francisco 49ers 
are tough to make a Super 
Bowl case for. They lost their 
two best pass rushers in line-
backers NaVorro Bowman 
and Aldon Smith with no re-
placements for at least half 
the season.
Some people think safety 
Donte Whitner is good (for 
some reason), and he left. 
The offense was not very 
good last year, and running 
back Frank Gore is not get-
ting any younger. However, 
while the weakened pass 
rush will hurt, the 49ers got a 
huge boost in the secondary, 
replacing big hitter Whitner 
with a much better football 
player, safety T.J. Ward. The 
49ers always had depth at 
linebacker, and while they 
are currently thin, Patrick 
Willis is enough to make the 
unit productive by himself. 
This defense was mediocre 
last season too, ?nishing 13th 
in defensive DVOA, accord-
ing to Football Outsiders. 
They might be a little better 
than that this year, because 
they were docked mostly for 
strength of schedule rather 
than lack of production.
The offense, however, will 
be fairly dominant. Quarter-
back Colin Kaepernick will 
continue to improve as both 
a passer and a runner, as his 
arm strength and athleticism 
make him a force to be reck-
oned with.
A whole season of wide 
receiver Michael Crabtree 
will be a huge help, and 
Stevie Johnson was a very 
smart signing as a third wide

Football
The Tartans traveled to 
Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity on Saturday to kick 
off their 2014 football season. 
The game marked the ?rst 
time the rivals had met as 
new af?liate members of the 
Presidents Athletic Confer-
ence (PAC). 
Case Western crushed any 
good feelings Carnegie Mel-
lon had coming into the game, 
as they dominated both sides 
of the ball in route to a 30–0 
victory. The stat line tells the 
true extent of the beatdown, 
with the Spartans accounting 
for over 300 more offensive 
yards than the Tartans. 
The Spartans were par-
ticularly effective on third 
downs, converting 54 percent 
of their attempts while hold-
ing Carnegie Mellon to only a 
31 percent success rate. First-
year quarterback Bryan Jan-
gro was a disappointment in 
his ?rst meaningful start for 
the Tartans, completing 19 of 
34 passes for only 149 yards 
with no touchdowns. 
Jangro was also the source 
of the only Carnegie Mellon 
turnover with a fumble at the 
start of the fourth quarter. 
The Tartans have a bye week 
to regroup and will face off 
against Washington & Jeffer-
son College on Sept. 20.
Men’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team traveled to 
Hiram, Ohio over the week-
end to participate in the Hi-
ram Tournament. 
On Friday, the Tartans 
faced off against Capital for 
the right to play in the cham-
pionship game the next day. 
After letting in an early 
goal, Carnegie Mellon re-
bounded with goals at the end 
of the ?rst half and halfway 
through the second half by 
junior forward and mid?elder 
Dimitrije Slavkovic and senior 
mid?elder Scott Gerfen, re-
spectively. 
Slavkovic tipped in a re-
bound off the post stemming 
from senior Mark Nicholas’s 
shot on goal. Gerfen scored 
in a similar fashion after se-
nior Jakob Rohwer’s shot was 
de?ected away by the Capital 
goalkeeper. 
On Saturday, the Tartans 
played the host Hiram College 
in the championship match. 
This time, Carnegie Mellon 
struck ?rst with junior mid-
?elder Connor Webb’s 26th-
minute de?ection off of Ro-
hwer’s free kick. 
The Tartans put the game 
out of reach with Slavkovic’s 
second goal of the tourna-
ment, this time coming from 
a long outlet pass by sopho-
more Tristan Lockwood to 
beat the defense. 
Hiram tried a comeback 
with a 69th-minute goal, but 
was unable to overcome the 
original two-goal de?cit. The 
Tartans next play at Geneva 
College on Wednesday.
Men’s Tennis
The Tartans men’s tennis 
team opened up its season on 
a high note with a 7–2 victory 
over Allegheny College in the 
Nancy J. Heath Tournament. 
The team was scheduled to 
start its season earlier in the 
day against Grove City Col-
lege, but that match was can-
celed. Carnegie Mellon fell in 
a hole early, trailing 2–1 after 
doubles play with only senior 
Will Duncan and ?rst year 
Edward Ang winning their 
match. 
These would be the last 
points the Tartans surren-
dered as they went 6–0 in 
singles play and cruised to the 
easy victory. Sophomores Ku-
nal Wadwani, Kenny Zheng, 
and Kiril Kirkov all won in 
straight sets along with Dun-
can. 
The Tartans will next com-

Women’s Golf
In their ?rst event as an 
NCAA member, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s golf team 
competed at the Westminster 
Invite on Saturday. Playing at 
New Castle Country Club, the 
Tartans placed second with a 
team score of 367, led by ?rst-
year Robin Tan’s 84, who had 
the second-best individual 
round of the tournament.
 Fellow ?rst-year Sum-
mer Kitahara hit an 86 over 
the 18 holes, which was good 
enough to place her third 
overall. 
First-years Emma Hoskins 
and Frances Hughes made 
up the rest of the inaugural 
squad, carding a 91 and a 106, 
respectively. 
The Tartans tee off next on 
Tuesday at the Grove City In-
vitational.

The Carnegie Mellon Wom-
en’s Soccer team took the ?eld 
to begin this year with a 2–0 
shutout win over the Salis-
bury University Seagulls on 
Saturday. 
The game was the ?rst in 
the 2014 Doubletree Tartan 
Cup. After a scoreless ?rst 
half, Carnegie Mellon scored 
two goals in the second half 
to seal their third straight 
victory. 
A very strong performance 
from Carnegie Mellon pre-
vented Salisbury from gener-
ating more than one chance, 
which resulted in a save by 
sophomore goalkeeper, Katie 
Liston. 
Goals from junior mid?eld-
er Carson Quiros and ?rst-
year mid?elder Haili Adams 
were key for the win.
The ?rst half was relatively 
slow paced with Carnegie 
Mellon dominating the ?ow 
of play. Only three shots were 
put on goal in the ?rst half, 
but the 0–0 score line was not 
re?ective of the level of play. 
When Quiros broke 
through for Carnegie Mellon 
less than 10 minutes into the 
second half, it was all downhill 
from there for the Seagulls. 
When junior forward Alli Mc-
Gugan perfectly set up Adams 
for Carnegie Mellon’s second 
goal of the match, there ap-
peared no way back for Salis-
bury, and the match ended at 
2–0.
Carnegie Mellon won a 
second game by the same 
score again Sunday morning 
against the Rochester Insti-
tute of Technology Tigers. 
Carnegie Mellon was playing 
strong attacking football from 
the beginning, with Adams 
scoring her second goal in 
as many games in the fourth 
minute, as she put in her own 
rebound. 
Senior forward Sevina 
Reid scored another midway 
through the ?rst half, and that  
began another 2–0 shutout. 
Carnegie Mellon was not as 
impressive in the second half 
as Rochester had a few chanc-
es to score, but they converted 
none of them and Carnegie 
Mellon held a second straight 
team goalless.After dominat-
ing the Tartan Cup, the wom-
en’s soccer team is looking 
forward to facing off against 
the Washington and Jefferson 
Presidents in a typical season-
al game. 
The match is Friday at 
7 p.m.

An inside look at the organization behind the TOC
Career Fairs: 
BOC & TOC
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Asst. Copy Manager
Did you know that the 
Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC) is almost 
completely organized and 
managed by Carnegie Mellon 
students? 
The Tartan took an in-
side look into the efforts that 
go into putting together this 
popular career fair, which is 
crucial in helping students 
network with various compa-
nies, and ultimately ?nding 
the right job.
Planning for the TOC be-
gins in the spring semester. 
“It starts off with the previous 
year’s committee selecting two 
directors,” said Arushi Chaw-
la, one of the directors of the 
TOC committee and a senior 
economics and electrical and 
computer engineering double 
major. 
Erin Persson, a junior civil 
and environmental engineer-
ing and engineering and pub-
lic policy double major, is the 
second director. 
“After that, we send out 
an application to all Society 
of Women Engineers (SWE) 
members, since SWE and the 
College of Engineering col-
laborate on putting together 
the TOC,” Chawla said.
After a rigorous interview 
process, about ten commit-
tee members are selected and 
assigned to one of four teams 
— corporate relations, public 
relations, human resources, 
and operations.
These teams work on dif-
ferent timelines based on their 
function. The corporate rela-
tions team begins reaching out 
to companies at the end of the 
spring semester.
 They work throughout the 
summer to discuss logistics 
with each company’s recruit-
ing team, in order to get all in-
terested companies registered 
by an early August deadline.
Once the fall semester be-
gins, the remaining teams 
take over. Public relations is 
responsible for publicizing the 
event, which involves putting 
up posters, talking to media, 
and generating awareness 
about the TOC. 
“It’s kind of like explaining 
what the TOC is and recom-
mending that freshmen attend 
for the experience,” said Patri-
cia Pan, a member of the TOC 
public relations team, and a 
sophomore chemical engi-
neering and biomedical engi-
neering double major.
The human resources team 
within the TOC committee is 
responsible for recruiting and 
managing students volunteers 
who help out during the event.
 Before the TOC opens to 
students, these volunteers 
help the company recruiters 
with parking, registration, and 
setup for their booths. 
Volunteers also help with 
any issues that may arise dur-
ing the day and tear down at 
the end of the day.
During the event itself, the 
operations team is responsible 
for ensuring that everything 
runs smoothly. 
Before the TOC, the team 
ensures that all the logistics 
are in place, including park-
ing, catering, bag check-in, 
and other things. 
The team also handles is-
sues that arise during the 
event, like non-functional 
equipment at booths, and 
delayed arrivals of packages 
mailed to Carnegie Mellon by 
the companies, among others.
Pulling off an event of this 
magnitude involves a great 
deal of careful planning, and 
long hours put in by the TOC 
committee. 
With the event spanning 
three days (Monday, Tuesday, 
and Wednesday) this year, 
rather than the usual two 
days, their work has increased 
a great deal, due to the need 
to spread awareness about 
this schedule change, and to 
coordinate an extra day of the 
career fair. 
However, their well-estab-
lished teams and procedures 
are sure to be effective in 
tackling these challenges, and 
providing students with a suc-
cessful career fair next week.

If you walk into the Uni-
versity Center over the next 
two weeks in your usual cam-
pus clothing, you may feel out 
of place amongst an excep-
tionally well-dressed crowd, 
the likes of which are rarely 
seen on campus outside of the 
Tepper School of Business. It’s 
that time of year again: vari-
ous companies are coming to 
campus for the Business Op-
portunities Conference (BOC) 
and Technical Opportunities 
Conference (TOC). The BOC 
will take place on Sept. 12 
from 1–4 p.m. in Wiegand 
Gym while the TOC will take 
place from Sept. 15–17 be-
tween the hours of 10 a.m. 
and 5 p.m. each day in the 
gym.
If you’re an underclass-
man, chances are that you’re 
not going to the career fairs. 
Perhaps, you intended to go, 
but are now having second 
thoughts, given the number 
of jobs that go to upperclass-
men. 
On the other hand, you 
may be going, but mainly 
for the swag — free stuff, 
for the uninitiated. Here are 
some better reasons to go 
to the upcoming fairs as an 
underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit back 
and think about your dream 
job. I bet there will be at least 
one company at the BOC and 
TOC where you can get that 
job, or do something related 
that’s equally exciting. 
This semester’s fairs are 
two of a select number of 
events at which you’ll have 
absolutely nothing to lose 
by talking to recruiters. Your 
passion may even impress 
them enough to land you that 
dream summer job! You’ll 
never know if you don’t take 
the plunge.
Preparation for next fairs
If you’re ?rmly convinced 
that there’s no way that the 
company of your choice will 
hire a ?rst-year or sophomore, 
here’s a more practical reason 
to go to the career fairs. 
Going to the fairs this year 
is good preparation for your 
following years at Carnegie 
Mellon. 
Attending this semester 
will allow you to feel what it’s 
like, so that you know what to 
expect as an upperclassman. 
Simply walk up to the compa-
ny that you’re eyeing for a job 
in the future, and chat with 
the recruiter. 
Ask about the company’s 
required quali?cations and 
interview process, so that you 
know what they’re looking for 
and can be better prepared 
for the following year, when 
you’re in the running for a job 
there.
Small booths hold much 
opportunity
While you’re at it, check 
out some of the smaller 
booths that none of the up-
perclassmen are going to. 
Chatting with the recruiters 
there is less stressful — some-
times even fun — and can def-
initely boost your con?dence.
And remember, they’re 
hiring too. So if they offer any 
opportunities you’re inter-
ested in, go for it! The odds of 
getting that job are substan-
tially higher and the company 
probably pays more than tra-
ditional summer employers.
So, hunt out your nic-
est formal clothes and be 
prepared to join the crowd 
of well-dressed students at 
the upcoming career fairs. 
Draft a quick résumé — or 
update an existing one you 
have — and print out a 
few dozen copies. Make a 
name tag, be sure to dress 
nicely, and get ready to go!

ROHAN VARMA
Asst. SciTech Editor
With the Technical Op-
portunities Conference just 
around the corner, Weigand 
Gym will soon be ?lled with 
recruiters and students from 
various technical majors.
As college students apply-
ing for internships and jobs, 
we often focus on the immedi-
ate problem: secure an offer 
letter. What we don’t usually 
plan for is the good, yet stress-
ful, problem that sometimes 
follows: multiple companies 
want you to be a part of their 
team, but which one do you 
pick? While there are many 
factors that go into choosing 
what place you will eventually 
call your home as an intern or 
full-time employee, the main 
problem that I faced this sum-
mer was simple: whether to 
choose a small startup or a 
mid- to large-sized company.
This dichotomy is relevant 
whether you receive mul-
tiple offer letters, or are sim-
ply picking which companies 
you would like to apply to in 
the ?rst place. After confer-
ring with peers who had ex-
periences with both types of 
companies, I ended up work-
ing at an early-stage startup 
this summer. Based on my 
own internship experience, 
as well as the experiences of 
many other Carnegie Mel-
lon students, here are some 
of the nexus questions you 
should think about when 
making your own decision. 
 
Impact
While most internships 
are invaluable because of the 
experience and knowledge 
you gain from working with a 
team, you might be looking for 
a place to leave your mark.
As part of a smaller com-
pany, the type of impact you 
can have is unique. As only a 
?rst-year working at Clipmine, 
a startup that is changing the 
way that we watch videos, I 
worked on important proj-
ects and made decisions on 
the product that would actu-
ally effect end users and the 
company’s trajectory. This 
experience was not one that 
I was expecting, but was ex-
tremely excited to be a part of.
Maya Rau-Murthy, a soph-
omore computer science and 
robotics double major who 
interned at a startup called 
Cloud Raxak, which is devel-
oping security protocols for 
the cloud, said:
“You end up having a very 
large impact and responsibili-
ty in the startup because there 
are only a couple of people 
working on the project. You re-
alize that your work is actually 
integral in their success and 
that responsibility is a really 
exciting feeling.”
Mukund Tibrewala, also a 
sophomore computer science 
and robotics double major, in-
terned at a 20-person startup 
called Transcriptic, Inc which 
is increasing the computation 
and parallelization in scien-
ti?c research. Recounting his 
experiences, he said:
“It was really cool because I 
was given projects that would 
have been assigned to full-
time employees otherwise. In 
addition to being exciting and 
substantial projects in their 
own right, they made me feel 
like I was meaningfully con-
tributing to Transcriptic. In 
fact, for the ?nal of my three 
projects, the engineer I was 
working with told me he’d 
been wanting to do it himself 
for an entire year, but never 
found the time.”
However, being a part of a 
large company does not mean 
you won’t be able to meaning-
fully contribute. Rokhini Prab-
hu, a senior computer science 
and mathematical sciences 
double major at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, has interned at 
both Apple and Google over 
the last two years and was able 
to provide insight into what 
it’s like making an impact in 
a large company. When asked 
to respond to the notion that 
it may be harder to make an 
impact in a large company, she 
said:
“I think it depends on the 
work you do. I have most de?-
nitely done meaningful work 
at big companies even during 
my internships. I’d like to think 
of it as high risk, high gains. 
Being heard might be harder 
in a big company compared 
to a startup. But when you are 
heard by the right people, you 
would have likely sparked off 
something big.”
“For example, if your work 
catches the eye of a director 
or [senior vice president] at 
a big company, then you will 
surely ?nd that several teams 
... are now suddenly scram-
bling together to work with 
you and make it a reality.” 
 
Structure
One key difference be-
tween a startup and a large 
company is a large company’s 
structure, such as protocols, 
practices, and policies that 
you would ?nd at a big com-
pany, but not necessarily at a 
small startup.
While these structures 
might hold a negative con-
notation, they are actually an 
attribute of large companies 
that could make your intern-
ship more enjoyable.
Prabhu said: “Over several 
years, these companies have 
iterated and built internal 
infrastructure that is aimed 
toward improving the lives of 
their engineers. So you don’t 
have to just spend, say, 20 
minutes sitting for your code 
to compile, because they have 
already found a way to paral-
lelize their build system and 
make it blazingly fast. I have 
found in my experience that 
there is a lot of value and 
thought given toward doing 
things the right way and not 
just hacking at something to 
make it work  —  so as to satisfy 
the investors.”
However, the freedom that 
comes with a startup also has 
its bene?ts. At companies like 
LinkedIn, there are many long 
protocols that are in place and 
steps that have to be taken 
before you are able to sub-
mit code to production; these 
can take many days, or even 
weeks. In contrast, I was able 
to push code to production on 
my ?rst day on the job, while 
still going through code re-
view processes and rigorously 
testing it.
Anqi Cong is a junior busi-
ness administration major 
and a computer science mi-
nor at Carnegie Mellon who 
has experienced life at both a 
large company, Unum, and a 
small company, Insightpool. 
While comparing the work 
?ow at a startup versus a large 
company, she said, “the way 
people go about projects is 
really different. For example, 
at Unum I had to download 
Microsoft Lync, but I had to 
ask my manager to request 
approval for me, which sent 
me an approval form I had to 
?ll out; but then I realized I 
had to get approval to access 
the approval.... In contrast, I 
was doing a research project 
for the startup and asked for 
compensation for my partici-
pants. The response was ‘Ok, 
how much do you need?’’” 
 
Culture
A key difference between a 
startup and a large company is 
the type of people you interact 
with.
At a larger company, you 
are more likely to interact with 
other interns from all over the 
country. 
For instance, companies 
like Facebook and Google take 
hundreds of interns each sum-
mer, which could connect you 
to a lot of amazing people. In 
addition to other interns, you 
have the opportunity to meet 
people you would never have 
the chance to otherwise. For 
instance, many of my friends 
interning at Facebook got the 
opportunity to meet Mark 
Zuckerberg and Facebook’s 
chief operating of?cer Sheryl 
Sandberg.
On the ?ip side, while small 
companies do not usually have 
more than a few interns or 
the famous names of a large 
company, it’s possible to be-
come close to everyone in the 
company. 
During my internship I got 
lunch with the entire team 
most days, played ping pong 
with the chief technology of-
?cer everyday, and felt like I 
made some great friends with 
people that will be great men-
tors to me.
While you are sure to 
make great connections 
no matter which company 
you choose, the nature of 
the connections can vary. 
 
Perks
This is the section where 
larger companies steal the 
show. Working at a startup, 
there weren’t many perks 
outside of how rewarding the 
work itself felt.
However, this is not the 
case at a big company.
Tian Jin, a sophomore 
computer science major at 
Carnegie Mellon, interned at 
Facebook over the summer as 
part of the Facebook U pro-
gram. She said, “Facebook 
would have talks and events, 
and there were a lot of trips 
into San Francisco that they 
arranged. Hillary Clinton also 
came to speak at the Menlo 
Park campus, and I feel like 
these talks and trips wouldn’t 
really be offered at a startup.”
Additionally, larger com-
panies usually have a selec-
tion of free restaurants to eat 
at alongside all the free food 
at the micro-kitchens located 
throughout their campuses. 
This is not to say that I didn’t 
raid my company’s kitchen ev-
ery week, but the options were 
no competition to the Googles 
and Facebooks of the world.
Other than just food and 
cool events, large companies 
also have great amenities for 
their employees. Cong said, 
“big companies have the re-
sources. You have the gym on 
campus, the cafeteria, free ice 
cream, your own cubicle, com-
pany-issued laptop, dual mon-
itors, and pay like crazy. But in 
exchange, bureaucracy.”
All in all, there is not a de-
?nitive, one-size-?ts-all an-
swer to the dilemma of choos-
ing between a startup and 
larger company. 
To choose, look at your op-
tions and see what aligns with 
your interests and goals. All 
this being said, whether you 
go with a ?ve-person company 
working in an incubator, or a 
2,000 person company where 
you are surrounded by free 
food, your internship will like-
ly be as good as you make it. 
 
Editor’s note: While the TOC 
typically attracts computer 
science, engineering, and sci-
ence majors, according to its 
website, the conference is 
open to students of all majors. 
Essentials for career fairs
BRADEN KELNER
Editor-in-Chief
University career fairs can 
sometimes seem like mad-
houses with hundreds of em-
ployers visiting each day and 
an even greater number of 
students passing through the 
fairs. Nevertheless, it’s impor-
tant to remain collected and 
professional when presenting 
yourself to the people who 
may soon be hiring you for a 
full-time position or summer 
internship. Following are ?ve 
things to bring to the Business 
Opportunities Conference 
(BOC) and Technical Oppor-
tunities Conference (TOC) to 
make sure you strike the per-
fect ?rst impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know 
what you’re doing is half the 
battle at a career fair. To make 
your attire re?ect the con?-
dence employers want to see 
in candidates, stick to a for-
mal dress code. For men, wear 
a business suit with a solid 
shirt or one that has a clean 
pattern. Tuck in your shirt, 
and wear a belt even if you 
don’t need one. 
Don’t forget a tie and a pair 
of black or brown shoes to ?n-
ish off your look. For women, 
wear a suit or a skirt with a 
suit jacket. Stick to neutral 
colors like black or gray, and 
wear heels to complement the 
out?t. Both men and women 
should take the time to iron 
out wrinkles in your pants 
and shirt and to brush off any 
smudges that may be linger-
ing on your jacket. As for hy-
giene, make sure your hair is 
cleaned up — cut and combed 
— and you look as if you got 
more than your fair share of 
sleep the night before, even if 
you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending fairs, 
visit the Career and Profes-
sional Development Center’s 
career fair webpages to view 
the companies coming to 
campus. Research those com-
panies and make a list of the 
ones that seem to be good 
?ts for your interests. For the 
companies you’re head over 
heels for, consider spicing 
up your résumé and making 
unique copies, rather than a 
general résumé, to focus on 
the qualities you know those 
companies are looking for. 
Hand your general résumé 
out to the companies you’re 
less interested in, but would 
still be happy to work for. 
By researching companies 
beforehand, you’re sure to 
make a better impression with 
recruiters. Knowing a com-
pany’s work and how you can 
speci?cally help the company 
will de?nitely make you stand 
out from the rest of the pack. 
 
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résu-
més, but don’t know what to 
do with them? Take a trip to 
the University Bookstore to 
pick up a portfolio. These ?rm 
folders for your papers will 
round out your professional 
look. 
Not only do they look 
sleek, but they also ensure 
that you won’t have any ré-
sumé snafus, such as drop-
ping all your papers or acci-
dentally handing a recruiter 
a résumé crafted for another 
company. These handy fold-
ers will allow you to organize 
your résumés, and possibly a 
list of references and samples 
of your work if your ?eld typi-
cally requires those elements. 
Portfolios are easy to tuck 
under your arm and walk 
with, so you won’t even know 
it’s there.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become 
packed and hectic. To give 
yourself some relief in your 
multiple layers of clothing, 
bring a water bottle. Take a 
drink if you’re feeling hot or 
overwhelmed for refreshing 
relief. 
Staying hydrated will en-
sure that you are focused be-
fore you visit the companies 
that potentially hold your 
dream jobs. Before the fair, 
also make sure to eat. Some-
times, you may ?nd yourself 
waiting in unexpectedly long 
lines, which could cut into 
time allotted for lunch after 
the fair. Even if the fair isn’t 
crowded, it’s always better to 
be overprepared rather than 
unprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at 
the career fair to land a job or 
internship. Act that way. Ap-
proach all recruiters as if you 
want nothing more than to 
work for their company. Greet 
them enthusiastically and 
shake their hand ?rmly. 
Show them what quali-
?es you for a position at their 
company through an already 
prepared speech, but be sure 
to be ?exible in what you’ve 
prepared if the recruiter has 
other plans for your conver-
sation. Be ready to answer 
some tough questions, and 
don’t break a sweat if you’re 
not able to adequately answer 
one. Answer it to the best of 
your ability and get ready for 
the next question. Ask the re-
cruiter some questions your-
self to show your interest and 
ensure that a position at the 
business is something you tru-
ly want to pursue. Thank the 
recruiter at the end of your 
conversation and follow up 
with an email after.

Death From Above 1979 returns
Physical World expands on dance-punk duo’s unique sound
Dance-punk duo Death from Above 1979 released 
their long-awaited sophomore effort, The Physical 
World, for free streaming on iTunes last Tuesday 
— a full week before its Sept. 9 release — and it’s 
the perfect soundtrack for punching holes in your 
wall, a night of sweaty debauchery, cutting lanes 
while speeding down a highway during a torrential 
downpour, or all three together. In short: it’s exactly 
what fans want and expect from Death from Above 
(DFA) 1979.
10 years ago, DFA 1979 released their debut album 
You’re a Woman, I’m a Machine and promptly 
kicked the entire music world right in the gonads. 
The record explodes into your eardrums with Jesse 
Keeler’s blistering-yet-groovy and heavily distorted 
bass riffs and Sebastien Grainger’s crashing drums 
and howling voice. The duo gave a million teenage 
bands inspiration to start making noise in the 
basement and had the whole industry wondering 
what would come next.
But then, in 2006, Keeler posted on the band’s 
website that DFA 1979 was no more, and the two 
musicians explored other projects — Keeler is one 
half of electronic duo MSTRKRFT, and Grainger 
released a solo album, amongst other collaborations.
Now, after a surprise announcement over the 
summer that came tied with the release of the first 
single, “Trainwreck 1979,” Physical World is finally 
here, and it appears that those 10 years didn’t go to 
waste.
Grangier sings on “Right On, Frankenstein” that 
nothing’s new and it’s just the same old song with 
a different tune, but on Physical World DFA 1979 
pushes their tried-and-true sound into new territory, 
and the result is an album that has the same sexy, 
dirty grit fans initially fell in love with but is more 
musically complex.
The riffs are more diverse and intricate this time 
around; the rhythms twist and turn; the tempos 
change on a dime — everything that was lacking in 
You’re A Woman, I’m A Machine is here on Physical 
World.
The album opens with the grooving “Cheap Talk” 
before diving straight into the ferocious “Right On, 
Frankenstein,” a roller-coaster ride that ends in a 
spiraling bass coda.
“Virgins” is a filthy stomp across innocence, with 
snarling lines like, “there’s nothing sacred to me/I 
lost it in the backseat.”
“White Is Red,” about a feuding and murderous 
couple, explores narrative storytelling in the lyrics, 
and is another example of new territories toward 
which the duo have pushed themselves.
The album begins to lose steam near the finish 
line — “Gemini” feels a bit like a rehash of previous 
album elements, and is one of the few instances of 
DFA 1979 falling back into their old bad habits on 
Physical World.
Concerning the reason for the new album, Grainger 
told music magazine NME that “No matter what 
Jesse and I do, on whatever scale of success it’s sat 
on, there’s always some kind of reference to Death 
from Above … So we’re putting out a Death from 
Above record and if the press is like, ‘It’s not what 
we expected,’ or however they react to it, it’s like 
‘Well, you’ve been f***ing asking for it.”
It certainly isn’t what I expected, because the 
general rule of thumb for a new album after a 
10-year hiatus is that it’s an embarrassing attempt 
to recapture a creative spark that likely died a long 
time ago. Instead, DFA 1979 returned in full form 
with new ideas to expand their sound. Instead of 
sounding like an aged copy of You’re A Woman, 
I’m A Machine, Physical World sounds like it’s 2006 
and they never even left.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I’ve been chatting with 
a guy I matched with on 
Tinder for the past couple 
of weeks, and it becomes 
clearer with every real 
conversation that I can’t 
stand him — but I can’t 
get up the nerve to 
unmatch and block him. 
Then he asked me out on 
a dinner date, and out of 
stupidity, I said yes — I 
haven’t been on a date in 
over a year, and this has 
been my only chance. 
However, I want to make 
sure this is the last date 
we’ll ever have, too. What 
should I do?
Regrettably yours, 
Without an Inch of Mettle, 
Pluck
Dear WIMP,
You need to make the date 
the oddest, or the most 
horrifying, experience of 
this guy’s life. You obviously 
don’t have to do both of 
these, but here are some 
fine suggestions on how to 
make this an awful date:
Wear bright colors — red 
on orange on yellow is 
preferable.
As soon as you sit down at 
your table: “Oh, god, did I 
just sit on something? Did 
you hear that squeak?” 
When he says no, look 
relieved and say, “Great. 
Do you know where the 
bathroom is? I’ve been 
holding in this huge dump.”
When you get back, 
interrupt his attempt at 
normal conversation with, 
“I like to tell this to people 
on the first date, just in 
case we move in together 
or get married: I have 
a history of constantly 
changing paraphilias, 
kicking in my sleep, and 
chronic explosive diarrhea. 
So I wouldn’t go use the 
bathroom while we’re here.”
Ask the waiter (call him 
garçon) if you can order 
a plate of uncooked bean 
sprouts. If he says no, insult 
him (if you have the guts) 
and order a meat-only dish.
If your date is still there 
when it’s time for the 
check, say you have to use 
the bathroom again — but 
just leave the restaurant. 
Make sure you drove 
yourself there.
If you find the experience 
of ruining this date 
immensely rewarding, 
I suggest you follow 
fuckyeahconnietinders.
tumblr.com, where Tartan 
alumna Connie Chan 
“approaches 99 percent of 
matches with the intent of 
trolling.”
Or just get off Tinder and 
meet people the 
old-fashioned way,
Evan Kahn

Two years after the release of Overexposed, Maroon 
5 debuted their ?fth album, V, on Tuesday. Since the 
band’s ?rst album, Songs About Jane, came out in 2002, 
the band has adopted an increasingly poppy sound, and 
V certainly follows that trend.
Here’s the verdict on this album in a nutshell: if you 
like pop music, you will like V. If you like Maroon 5, 
you will like V. If you like to dance, you will like V. If 
you like heartfelt lyrics, you will like V. If you are a fan 
of the band’s ?rst CD and have been giving them ?ack 
ever since their second album for “selling out,” you will 
probably not like V.
Before the review of this CD, let’s get a few things out in 
the open. Full disclosure, I am a huge fan of Maroon 5, 
so is this review biased? Maybe. Consider it an expert 
opinion.
That being said, yes, it’s true that Songs About Jane was 
a great album. Yes, it’s true that the albums since Songs 
About Jane do not sound like that one did. But if they all 
sounded the same, Maroon 5 would be considered a one 
trick pony and, quite frankly, it would be boring.
There is something to be said for a band that has been 
popular for 12 years, and still averages 3.75 hit singles 
on each album (actual calculation) and can diversify 
their sound enough to keep their music interesting and 
relevant. Say what you will about Maroon 5 betraying 
their true roots. If four out of their ?ve albums do not 
sound like Songs About Jane, then maybe the original 
album wasn’t actually their “true sound.” Whatever 
you think about the band and how it has evolved, I 
recommend listening to V with an open mind.
With that said, let’s move onto the review.
Maroon 5 has always been able to promise upbeat, 
funky melodies that stick in your head for days and this 
album does not disappoint. “Sugar,” “Feelings,” and 
“It Was Always You” carry on this tradition, as well as 
singles you’ve probably already heard on the radio over 
the summer: “Maps,” and “Animals.” A techno/pop vibe 
reminiscent of disco music makes fresh the signature 
high-pitched threads throughout the songs that lead 
singer Adam Levine is famous for. These songs will have 
you at least tapping your foot, if not dancing around your 
dorm room.
V also carries on the Maroon 5 tradition of heartfelt lyrics 
about love and all of its ups and downs. “Animals” and 
“Sugar” are upbeat songs celebrating a relationship 
that is going well, whereas “Unkiss Me” and “Leaving 
California” lament the end of a love affair. One of Maroon 
5’s greatest qualities is writing relatable songs. No 
matter your current mood, if you have ever experienced 
romantic feelings for another human being, chances are 
you can relate to at least one of the songs on V.
Though it adheres to many of Maroon 5’s traditions, 
V does deviate in the writing process. The band 
collaborated with many other artists on the development 
and production of these songs, including such familiar 
names as Ryan Tedder, Gwen Stefani, Sia, and Nate 
Ruess, though Stefani is the only one whose voice is 
heard on the album. The input of this array of artists 
helped contribute to the eclectic sound of V. Those 
familiar with these artists will recognize their in?uence. 
For example, Nate Ruess of Fun. collaborated with the 
band in the writing of “Leaving California,” and the song 
does sound like the lovechild of Maroon 5 and Fun. 
Even with other artists helping out on V, Levine still put 
his touch on every song. Say what you will about him 
or the band in general; the lead singer/guitarist helped 
write every single song on each of their albums, and V is 
no exception.
If you don’t listen to the entire album all the way 
through, here are the highlights of V listed in 
chronological order as they appear on the tracklist:
“Animals”
This song has a great beat, steamy lyrics, and classic 
Maroon 5 sexual metaphors. Blast it when you’re 
working out to get you motivated or play it when you’re 
with your signi?cant other to set the mood. Either way, if 
you have any af?nity for fun, upbeat songs, this one is a 
must listen.
“Leaving California”
In a much different tone than “Animals,” this song tells a 
story about a love lost. Soulful vocals, smooth melodies, 
and a sweet message make this song a go-to for anyone 
going through a breakup, or someone who just enjoys 
listening to sincerely written love songs. It is no “She Will 
Be Loved,” but it has similar emotions behind it.
“Feelings”
Starting out with funky guitar picks and a long, howling 
vocal brings listeners back a few decades and immediately 
gets toes tapping. Adam begs an elusive lover to leave her 
boyfriend and be with him, and you almost want her to 
stay so that he keeps singing. Anybody looking for a good 
dance beat, this is your song.
“Shoot Love”
This song is only on the deluxe version of the CD, but 
de?nitely worth a listen. A moving beat and restless 
drums add to the anxious tone of the song, in which 
Adam begs a woman for mercy. Complete with the 
high-pitched trills typical of Maroon 5 songs and a tone 
that makes the listener feel as if they are listening to an 
action movie, this is a unique and interesting song that 
showcases the band’s storytelling abilities. Don’t let the 
extra cost of the deluxe edition deter you from this.
Overall, V does not disappoint. It has all the 
characteristics of a classic Maroon 5 CD, but with a 
fun, retro twist on the melodies. The collaborations paid 
off in a diverse mix of songs that somehow all ?t into a 
coherent whole. Forget about your preconceived feelings 
toward Maroon 5 for a minute and listen to this CD with 
an open mind. Fans of the album will be happy to know 
that the band also announced tour dates, and Maroon 
5 will be coming to Pittsburgh at the CONSOL Energy 
Center on March 13.

Another September, another round of new shows 
Murder, Batman, and hangovers rule television this Fall in these upcoming series
There may not be much time left before classes pick up 
and you ?nd yourself burying your nose in books, even 
on the weekends. While you may already be looking 
forward to fall television series returning for their latest 
seasons, there are a number of new gems premiering 
this fall for you to escape into when you ?nd yourself 
looking for a much needed break.
Gotham
“Before there was Batman, there was Gotham,” 
according to FOX’s newest television series, set to 
premiere on Monday, Sept. 22. This origin story about 
the masked crusader’s home city will be told through the 
eyes of detective James Gordon (Ben McKenzie, known 
for his starring role in The O.C.). The detective will star 
alongside another detective, Harvey Bullock (Donald 
Lobe) and a young Bruce Wayne (David Mazouz), who 
will witness the death of his parents at the start of the 
series, sending Gotham into a spiraling plummet of 
crime. The show will tell the origins of the DC Comics 
Batman villains, like the Penguin and Joker, to reveal 
how Gotham became the corrupt city it is known to be 
today. For lovers of cop thrillers with a mix of supervillain 
madness, this show is one you won’t want to miss.
How To Get Away with Murder
Airing three days after Gotham on Thursday, Sept. 25, 
ABC’s How To Get Away with Murder will take viewers 
on what promises to be a ride full of “sex,” “lies,” and 
“murder.” Viola Davis starts as Middleton Law School’s 
Annalise Keating, a strong-willed professor who teaches 
Criminal Law 100, or as she calls it, How To Get Away 
with Murder. Through a series of assignments and 
cases, Keating will teach her students how to discredit 
witnesses, identify suspects, and bury the evidence that 
can be used against them. The show promises to be one 
full of scandals in a world where the stars try to uphold 
the law in a professional setting through law-breaking 
tactics, like sleeping with witnesses for information. 
Who knows, the show’s starring students may even ?nd 
themselves implicated as suspects in a murder.
Bad Judge
Unlike How To Get Away with Murder, NBC’s Bad 
Judge, airing on Thursday, Oct. 2, will take on the law in 
a completely different way. Judge Rebecca Wright (Kate 
Walsh) promises to battle hangovers in the court room 
while con?dently doling out justice. “Please be seated. 
Do it quietly. I’ve got a headache, and somebody get me 
some Gatorade,” Wright complains before sleeping with 
a witness and whispering to her bailiff in 
court that she’s thankful a pregnancy test 
isn’t positive during the show’s of?cial 
trailer. The series will also tout a story 
about Wright’s relationship with a young 
boy named Robby Shoemaker (Theodore 
Barnes), whose parents she sentences 
to prison. Their relationship will develop 
throughout the show, and Wright will 
become a mentor to the young boy, 
possibly allowing him to live with her. For 
viewers looking for a raunchy, yet friendly 
show, look no further. This new comedy 
looks like it will deliver some fantastic 
one-liners and a story to pull at your 
heartstrings.

And the best movie of the year goes to…
We’ve all heard about Boyhood, written and directed 
by Richard Linklater (Dazed and Confused, the Before 
trilogy) which begins with 6-year-old boy Mason (Ellar 
Coltrane) and follows him through his tween and teen 
years, up until he hits 18. And, yes, Linklater uses the 
same boy, not to mention the same cast, for 12 long 
years.
The general consensus is that those 12 years 
automatically classify it as a masterpiece. Anyone who 
has heard of Boyhood usually exclaims the same things:
“It took 12 years to make this ?lm!” “They used the same 
cast for 12 years, the same boy from when he was six to 
18! Can you believe it?” “It was incredible! It made me so 
nostalgic for my childhood because I’ll never get it back.”
All of those things are true. And, yes, Boyhood was 
an amazing ?lm. It’ll most likely dominate this year’s 
awards season. The scope and ambition of this project is 
beyond comprehension and the stakes, in retrospect, are 
impossibly high. What if some people die in the allotted 
12 years time? Who is going to ?nance a ?lm for that 
long? What if Ellar Coltrane turns out to be a bad actor?
Fortunately, Linklater triumphed — and what an amazing 
triumph Boyhood turned out to be. Linklater’s dangerous 
decision to work with the same cast for 12 years allowed 
him to portray youth so accurately that the ?lm feels like 
a true journey through a person’s life. Patricia Arquette, 
who plays Olivia, deserves at least three Oscars for her 
role as Mason’s struggling-yet-steadfast mother. The 
performances of the entire cast transcend acting and 
boil down to sharing essences of actual people with the 
audience.
The amazing part of Boyhood is that it is not just a movie. 
It transcends the ?lm medium because there are no 
plot twists, no villains, nor are there any “extraordinary” 
events that result in typical cinematic climax. But that’s 
what makes it special. By giving attention to universal 
experiences that individuals would not ordinarily deem 
movie-worthy — such as going bowling with your father 
or waiting in line for the newest Harry Potter book — 
Linklater provides moments of realization that every one 
of life’s moments is precious. Many of the moments in 
the ?lm are genuine experiences that we have personally 
gone through, but usually store away as mundane or 
insigni?cant —yet those moments are essential to our 
own coming-of-age adventures oh-so-many years ago.
It’s easy to label Boyhood as nostalgic, leaving us 
desperately hoping to relive those moments again and 
again. And yes, the story and the characters are so 
authentic that we connect our memories with those of 
the ?lm. However, the most important experience from 
Boyhood stems from Mason and his family letting go 
without even a second thought.
Naturally, there is no traditional plot in this movie — 
just story. Mason doesn’t dwell on the hardships of his 
youth, nor does he grasp onto any glorious memories. He 
simply moves on. There is no signi?cant bene?t that we, 
the audience, get from clinging to the memories of our 
youth. Time and change are inevitable, elusive engines 
of life, so our childhood stays behind while we must 
grow up and move on. But that does not mean we are 
forced to toss away our sensibility as we get older.
Why did Linklater choose to document 12 years of 
someone’s childhood? Why not make Adulthood? Or 
Midlife Crisis? Or Old Age? If it’s just for the sake of 
nostalgia, then what’s the point of spending 12 years on 
a ?lm?
We can still nourish the sense of wonder and curiosity 
that made our youth so special. It’s optimal to fully 
welcome every waking moment of our lives and to 
awaken the next day as a wiser, more courageous person 
than yesterday.

Sixty years after the iconic original, in a time when lackluster reboots and sequels 
plague theaters, there is one that ?nally got it right. Godzilla is a powerful spectacle 
packed not only with glorious monsters, but with substantial human drama that 
pushes the story forward. The movie stays true to the creature’s origins; at a 
nuclear plant in Japan, supervisor Joe Brody (dramatic demigod Bryan Cranston) 
is devastated by a nuclear disaster that destroys not only his plant but his family. 
Years later, he becomes obsessed by the possibility that the disaster is a cover up 
for something much bigger. His now grown son, Lieutenant Ford Brody (the oh-so-
swoon-worthy Aaron Taylor-Johnson), reluctantly tries to get his seemingly crazy 
father off his wagon when they ?nd out there actually is something beyond a nuclear 
conspiracy. Godzilla procures one of the scariest monsters in recent movie history 
in a tale about unstoppable forces of nature, resulting in an exhilarating moviegoing 
experience.

We all know the tale of Princess Aurora, also known by her street name Sleeping 
Beauty, who pricked her ?nger and was cursed to an eternal slumber, waiting for 
true love’s kiss to break the spell. She was cursed by the evil Male?cent, but how 
much do we know about the sorceress behind the spell? In a modern retelling of 
the original 1959 Disney ?lm Sleeping Beauty, Male?cent ?ips the protagonist into 
one of the most iconic villains of all (Male?cent, if you couldn’t tell from the title) and 
tells the story through her dazzling green eyes. Angelina Jolie is the perfect ?t as the 
alluring and magnetic Male?cent, with her marvelously angular cheekbones, sinister 
voice and enigmatically evil personality. By providing a substantial back story for its 
titular anti-heroine, Male?cent is an interesting case study of how we view villains, 
particularly female ones, and what constitutes a strong character who just happens 
to be female. If you’re not into the Disney vibe, don’t worry. Male?cent packs 
the punch with delicious performances and an untold fairytale that is refreshingly 
wonderful.
