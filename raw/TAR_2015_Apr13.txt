Carnegie Mellon is in 
the process of ?nalizing its 
2015 Strategic Plan, a se-
ries of strategies that will 
guide university policy for 
the next decade. The Plan 
is organized into three 
main pillars: Transforma-
tive Teaching and Learning; 
Transformative Research, 
Creativity, Innovation, and 
Entrepreneurship; and The 
Transformative CMU Expe-
rience. Senior global studies 
and Hispanic studies double 
major Juan Acosta noticed 
something missing, howev-
er, after attending the most 
recent Strategic Planning 
town hall event: diversity.
Acosta wrote an opinion 
piece for the March 23 is-
sue of The Tartan voicing 
his discontent. Last week, 
Acosta hosted two student-
led diversity forums — one 
on Thursday and one on Fri-
day — hoping to come away 
with a set of tangible strate-
gies that the university can 
implement.
“All the pillars are sup-
posed to have diversity wo-
ven into them, in one way or 
another,” Acosta said in the 
introduction to Thursday’s 
forum, hosted in Baker Hall’s 
Giant Eagle Auditorium. “So 
at this meeting, it was clear 
to me that there was a lack 
of commitment to diversity 
in the presentation that was 
delivered, and it lacked a lot

Project Rwanda honors anniversary
BRIAN WALSH
Staffwriter
Lasting 100 days, from 
April 7 to mid-July 1994, and 
claiming nearly one million 
lives, the Rwandan Genocide 
still pervades people’s memo-
ries. The event marked its 21st 
anniversary this past Tuesday. 
A con?ict between two groups, 
the Hutu and Tutsi, the geno-
cide marred the country in 
many ways for years to come. 
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
donned silver and gray rib-
bons in memoriam of those 
who lost their lives, a tradition 
that lasts a week in Rwanda 
each year. Carnegie Mellon’s 
student group Project Rwanda 
organized the day’s event.
Project Rwanda started in 
2010 with help from Assistant 
Director of Student Affairs M. 
Shernell Smith and Assistant 
Dean of Student Affairs Renee 
Camerlengo. 
It is a “student guided ini-
tiative,” according to its proj-
ect narrative, and remains one 
of Carnegie Mellon’s only phil-
anthropic initiatives in Africa. 
The overall goal of the proj-
ect is to help Rwanda strive 
for a more knowledge-based 
economy: a goal relevant to 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus in 
Kigali, Rwanda.
As the connection between 
Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh 
campus and Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Rwanda graduate cam-
pus grows, the prevalence of 
Project Rwanda’s initiative 
continues to grow as well. 
Junior computer science 
major Ben Plaut chose to place 
the ribbon on his backpack. “It 
is great that the organization 
is spreading awareness about 
this, because there are so 
many things that students at 
Carnegie Mellon aren’t aware 
of,” Plaut said.
Awareness is exactly the 
goal of this initiative, and not 
just awareness for the atro-
cious event 21 years past, but 
the current thriving nation of 
Rwanda. Second-year mas-
ter’s candidates Josephine 
Mukesha, a Rwandan native, 
and Ivy Wainaina, a Kenyan 
native, found the Project 
Rwanda organization impor-
tant for the Carnegie Mellon 
campus. “If you don’t talk 
about it, then you aren’t giving 
values to the one million lives 
that were lost,” Mukesha said 
on the importance of discus-
sion in memoriam.
The ribbon project acts as 
a ?rst step in learning about 
Rwanda’s genocide and post-
genocide reconstruction. “It 
happened 21 years ago. So 
much has happened after 
that: Rwanda is working to 
rebuild the country, and some 
outside people are still in the 
mindset that it happened yes-
terday,” Mukesha said.
Rwanda now leads most 
African countries in innova-
tion and education. “If you go 
to Kigali now, it looks nothing 
like what the videos would 
show you of genocide. It has 
good infrastructure, LTE, free 
laptops for children. If you 
think of innovation in Africa, 
Tobacco-free campus policy approved
BRIAN WALSH
Staffwriter
The future looks dim for 
smokers on campus. On Thurs-
day, the Undergraduate Stu-
dent Senate approved a pro-
posal banning tobacco wholly 
from campus. Yet, proponents 
of banning tobacco products 
aren’t necessarily smoking the 
competition.
The proposal passed 
through Senate with 15 in 
favor, 13 against, and one 
abstaining senator. Now, the 
policy has to make its way 
through Graduate Student As-
sembly, Faculty Senate, and 
Staff Council. 
Afterwards, University 
President Subra Suresh must 
sign off on the policy taking 
effect. If all the pieces fall into 
place, and the policy does take 
effect, tobacco use will be 
banned on campus entirely. 
According to the draft of 
the proposed policy, “Smoking 
and use of other tobacco prod-
ucts is prohibited by students, 
staff, faculty, and visitors in all 
university buildings, facilities 
or property owned, leased, or 
operated by Carnegie Mellon 
University, including campus 
grounds and outside areas.”
The policy continues to 
de?ne a “tobacco product” as 
“any type of product contain-
ing, made, or derived from 
tobacco that is intended for 
human consumption and in-
gested by any means.”
The proposed policy does 
make concessions for e-cig-
arettes, the health effects of 
which are still debated. 
As a result of this, the poli-
cy prohibits campus communi-
ty members from using e-ciga-
rettes or vaporizers indoors, 
but allows their use outdoors.
Beginning with a rational-
ity statement, the policy itself 
relies heavily on the example 
set by over 1,000 other uni-
versities that have already 
banned tobacco from campus. 
“We believe that making a 
campus tobacco-free is con-
sidered the gold standard of 
health,” Dean of Student Af-
fairs Gina Casalegno, who sits 
on the smoking policy review 
committee that wrote the poli-
cy, said of the policy.
Mainly focusing on the 
health of Carnegie Mellon 
community members, the 
policy seeks to aid not only 
bystanders, but current users 
“Smoking and use of any type 
of product containing, made, 
or derived from tobacco that is 
intended for human consumption 
and ingested by any means by 
students, staff, faculty, and 
visitors in all university buildings, 
facilities, or property owned, 
leased, or operated by Carnegie 
Mellon University [will be] 
prohibited.”

UHS proposes changes in Aetna insurance options
LAURA SCHERB
Publisher
Members of University 
Health Services (UHS), ini-
tiated an attempt to make 
rapid, last-minute changes 
to the Carnegie Mellon and 
Aetna joint insurance poli-
cies, prompting discussion 
on campus and an impending 
announcement. 
During the latest round 
of negotiations and yearly 
contract renewal from Aetna, 
Carnegie Mellon’s insurance 
provider, UHS Business Man-
ager Phyllis Lombardi noticed 
some worrisome changes. 
“The rates were much higher 
because of a phenomenon 
called rate parity,” Lombardi 
said. “It really caught me off 
guard — the rates went up 
between 13 and 24 percent.”
According to Lombardi, 
dependent rate parity indi-
cates that the rates charged 
to the dependents of student 
subscribers of the insurance 
must not exceed the rate 
charged to the subscriber. 
Because everyone — in-
cluding subscribers, spouses, 
and dependents — is covered 
by these plans, the extra costs 
of the extra coverage be-
comes a burden on everyone 
who buys insurance, even if 
they themselves do not have 
dependents on the plan. 
In order to cover those 
costs, the price of insurance 
packages had gone up, far 
past the 15 percent increase 
cap that Carnegie Mellon and 
Aetna Insurance had agreed 
upon. “Across the board, 
across the country, health 
insurance costs have gone

was initiated. The driver was 
con?rmed to be intoxicated 
and was subsequently placed 
under arrest for driving under 
the in?uence.
Underage Drinking
Apr. 5, 2015
A University Police of?cer 
observed a female student 
face down on the sidewalk, 
near the intersection of Forbes 
and Morewood Avenues. Po-
lice summoned medical as-
sistance. The female student 
was con?rmed to be under the 
legal drinking age and is being 
cited for the violation.
Suspicious Activity
Apr. 9, 2015
A student ?led reports 
with University Police and the 
Pittsburgh Bureau of Police 
regarding a male of Middle 
Eastern European descent in 
his late 20’s to early 30’s, with 
a scruffy beard, black short 
hair and bushy eyebrows op-
erating a four-door, silver or 
gray, older model vehicle pull-
ing beside her as she walked 
in Shadyside. 
The male stated “Get in the 
car,” during one encounter 
and drove slowly at her pace 
as she walked on the street. 
Several days later, the student 
saw the vehicle again, which 
drove suspiciously as she 
walked in Shadyside. The stu-
dent was advised to contact 
police immediately if the un-
identi?ed male is seen again.

Announcements of the 
results for the 2014 William 
Lowell Putnam Mathematical 
Competition have revealed 
an impressive outcome for 
Carnegie Mellon. The Carn-
egie Mellon University team, 
consisting of junior science 
and humanities scholar 
Linus Hamilton and sopho-
more mathematical sciences 
majors Thomas Swayze and 
Samuel Zbarsky, won ?fth 
place, marking the team’s 
fourth consecutive year to 
place among the top ?ve. In 
addition, 55 individual Carn-
egie Mellon students placed 
among the top 507, the sec-
ond most of any university.
On Dec. 6, 2014, 4,320 
American and Canadian un-
dergraduate students gath-
ered from 557 institutions, 
including a strong showing of 
205 students from Carnegie 
Mellon, to participate in the 
75th William Lowell Putnam 
Mathematical Competition, 
often simply referred to as 
the Putnam Competition. Ad-
ministered by the Mathemat-
ical Association of America, 
the famously challenging ex-
amination is considered the 
premier mathematics contest 
for undergraduates. 
According to the release, 
John Mackey, associate head 
of the Mathematical Scienc-
es Department, stated, “We 
are tremendously proud of 
all the Putnam participants, 
including their coach [as-
sistant professor of math-
ematical sciences Po-Shen] 
Loh, for their skill, spirit and 
determination. For us, this is 
more exciting than the NCAA 
Basketball Tournament. It’s 
our December and March 
Madness!”
Those on the team and 
who placed in the top 21 are 
part of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Knaster-McWilliams Schol-
ars program, a scholarship-
supported and honors pro-
gram that features increased 
access to faculty and early 
research opportunities. It is 
funded through the generos-
ity of a physics alumnus and 
mathematics and electrical 
engineering alumnus.
Each member of the uni-
versity team will receive a 
$200 cash prize, and Carn-
egie Mellon’s Department 
of Mathematical Sciences in 
the Mellon College of Science 
will receive $5000.

Yemeni con?ict escalates
Saudi Arabia continues to 
carry out airstrikes in Yemen.  
Saudi Arabia is the leading 
country behind airstrikes 
against the Iranian-backed 
Houthi movement in Yemen. 
Saudi Arabia accused Iran 
of providing military aid to 
the Houthi movement. Saudi 
Arabia extended its bombing 
campaign in order to stop the 
Houthi movement and its al-
lies from dominating Yemen. 
The Houthi continued 
their advance and have killed 
more than 500 people and 
wounded 1,700 in the past 
three weeks.
The insults and threats 
have raised fears of a Ye-
meni con?ict that could 
further in?ame the rivalry 
between Iran and Saudi Ara-
bia. Houthi-allied forces have 
taken control of government 
of?ces in Ataq, the capital of

of student detail. It also lacked 
a lot of student input, which is 
why I decided to host a stu-
dent forum.”
At the forum, students and 
faculty broke off into small 
discussion groups to work 
through a list of questions 
that Acosta had provided. 
The questions — including 
“What does the phrase ‘trans-
formative experience’ mean 
to you?” and “How do you 
believe Carnegie Mellon can 
recruit quali?ed minority stu-
dents and ensure they gradu-
ate on time?” — focused on 
diversity in the context of the 
Strategic Plan. After an hour 
of discussion, the groups re-
convened to share what they 
had talked about.
Acosta worked with a 
small committee of students 
and faculty who, he said, 
came together after his piece 
was published in The Tartan. 
Acosta speci?cally credits M. 
Shernell Smith, assistant di-
rector of Student Affairs, for 
helping put together the fo-
rums. “We just came together 
to think, ‘What’s a way we can 
do something with this?’ And 
the person who was really 
integral to putting this all to-
gether was Shernell,” he said.
Smith emphasized the im-
portance of student voices 
in conversations surround-
ing campus diversity, itself a 
diverse and complicated is-
sue. “I think when you look 
at diversity, it is about who 
we have, but also what we 
do and what we have,” Smith 
said. “It’s not just about indi-
viduals; it’s about diversity of 
thought and how we go about 
our thinking and how we go 
about our engagement.”
Smith pointed to the many 
existing university initiatives 
that target diversity, including 
the Community Collage dur-
ing orientation and this year’s 
focus on Martin Luther King, 
Jr. Day as a “day on” to look 
at issues of diversity and race 
in America rather than just a 
day off from classes. Smith 
also advises Colors@CMU, a 
student organization just re-
cently recognized by the uni-
versity that organizes events 
meant to start conversations 
about diversity on campus.
The Of?ce of Admission 
also hosted the Celebration 
of Diversity weekend this past 
weekend, an event designed 
to help prospective minority 
students feel included in the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
The Strategic Plan, Smith 
said, gives the administration 
and students a chance to look 
critically at how the university 
addresses issues of diversity. 
“It’s everybody’s issue, but 
also at the same time I think 
that we’re in a place in which 
we’re looking ahead. The 
Strategic Plan allows for there 
to be evolution from where 
we’ve been; it allows us to 
look at where we could be and 
where we should be,” she said.
“One of the things that 
President Suresh talks about a 
lot is that at the intersection of 
innovation is diversity,” Smith 
said. “And so that comes for-
ward not just in terms of num-
bers, but just in meaningful 
engagement and dynamics 
associated with the collab-
orative nature of what we talk 
about at Carnegie Mellon.”
Scribes sat with each dis-
cussion group to take notes on 
the discussion and the ideas 
presented; Acosta and the 
committee who organized the 
forums are currently drafting 
a call to action for the univer-
sity based on the discussions 
between students and admin-
istrators last Thursday and 
Friday.

you should think Rwanda,” 
Wainania said.
Many problems still ex-
ist in and around Carnegie 
Mellon Rwanda’s Kigali 
campus, providing a unique 
problem-solving opportunity 
for Pittsburgh students. “The 
Rwandan campus can show 
the challenges that CMU stu-
dents don’t necessarily face. 
Africa is such a big market, 
and can give another perspec-
tive. So students can think of 
a problem from a different 
perspective, or see problems 
that you don’t have here. So it 
gives students a global view, 
too,” Mukesha said, marking 
the importance of intercam-
pus connectivity.
Africa is modernizing it-
self, and Rwanda is no ex-
ception. “Africa is such a big 
market, and can give another 
perspective. So students can 
think of a problem from a 
different perspective, or see 
problems that you don’t have 
here. So it gives students a 
global view, too,” Mukesha 
said.
Mukesha emphasized 
that in many Rwandan ur-
ban areas, technology is just 
as present and up to date as 
in the U.S., contrary to what 
some students may think.
“It’s interesting to see 
some technological things 
that seem new here in the 
United States, but then to re-
alize that we’ve had it for a 
long time. Take, for instance, 
paying money with your 
phone. That has been around 
in Rwanda for what feels like 
forever,” Wainania said.
All these ideas for campus 
connection and understand-
ing show the true idea behind 
Project Rwanda: People are 
all people, and they should 
not be afraid to talk to each 
other and learn from others’ 
experiences. 
“Some people were in a 
family of twenty, and now it 
is just them. If you don’t talk 
to those people, if you don’t 
give them empathy for their 
pain, you can’t go forward. 
To move forward, you need to 
remember the past, and you 
need to remember the pain 
to the point where it should 
never happen again,” Muke-
sha said, a message very com-
mon about genocide, yet very 
often overlooked.

Senate approves tobacco policy
and new users. 
“We do care a lot about 
individuals who consume to-
bacco and wish to receive aid 
in cessation of those habits” 
Casalegno added last week in 
an interview with The Tartan.
Preventing people from 
starting and current smok-
ers from continuing is a goal 
of the smoking policy review 
committee. 
The policy cites the Sur-
geon General, stating that 
smoking still exists as the 
“leading preventable cause of 
death in the United States” in 
its rationale for the policy. 
Going forward, other or-
ganizations hold these argu-
ments in mind when they put 
it to a vote. The GSA and Fac-
ulty Senate will consider the 
views of smokers as well in 
their upcoming votes on the 
policy.
The population of smokers 
on campus is diverse, much 
like the population of Carn-
egie Mellon itself. 
Over 20 percent of Carn-
egie Mellon’s 13,000 students 
are from different countries, 
a signi?cant portion of those 
students hailing from China 
or Korea. 
In the international 
sphere, China and Korea as 
countries consume more ciga-
rettes than the United States. 
Per capita per year consump-
tion of cigarettes is 700 ciga-
rettes higher and about 1000 
cigarettes higher in China and 
Korea respectively, according 
to the Washington Post.
With such a signi?cant 
number of students from 
abroad, and from countries 
that consume that much more 
on average, the Smoking Pol-
icy Review Committee has a 
signi?cant cultural hurdle to 
combat with the new policy. 
Yet data from other uni-
versities which have banned 
tobacco shows a signi?cant 
decrease in the number of us-
ers after a smoke- and tobac-
co-free policy is implemented 
on campuses.
Data from the Center for 
Disease Control and Preven-
tion (CDC) shows a decrease 
in overall users in the United 
States of about 20 percent 
since 1965. 
With CDC domestic ?g-
ures, Pennsylvania still ranks 
eighth in smoking prevalence. 
On a dogmatic level, schools 
see this number decreasing 
with preventative measures 
just like the Committee’s pro-
posed policy. 
The future of the policy is 
balancing upon whether or 
not the respective governing 
bodies buy into this vision.

up; everyone knows that and 
everyone hears about it every-
day. Everyone is paying more, 
but this was way, way more 
than we expected,” Lombardi 
said.
Lombardi began to investi-
gate ways through which the 
university could help to cut 
the cost of insurance cover-
age for students, knowing that 
about 60 percent of the stu-
dent body uses Aetna as their 
insurance provider. 
“As it is now, students on 
the standard plan are subsidiz-
ing insurance costs for every-
one, including the enhanced 
plan subscribers. I also know 
that the students on the en-
hanced plans are the ones who 
know they’ll use it — they’re 
chronically ill, they plan on 
needing to stay in the hospital, 
or they’re pregnant and they 
know they’re going to have a 
baby — so they choose the en-
hanced plan to cover that. 
“About 75 percent of those 
students use their insurance 
because it’s covered. But with 
the standard plan, students 
treat it as ‘just in case’ insur-
ance, and 75 percent don’t use 
it,” she added.
Students who have the 
standard plan are often unable 
to pay the $400 deductible, 
the 20 percent coinsurance, or 
the $3,000 out of pocket maxi-
mum, according to Lombardi. 
They simply can’t afford it, 
so they don’t use the plan. “Af-
ter all of that, I thought, ‘What 
if there was only one plan and 
only one plan that we had to 
subsidize dependents for?’ 
Then I went to the Graduate 
Student Assembly [GSA], to 
the Undergraduate Student 
Senate, and to Gina [Casa-
legno, dean of student affairs] 
and to Michael [Murphy, vice 
president of campus affairs] to 
see how quickly people could 
be socialized to the plan.”
The single plan program 
would feature just the en-
hanced plan as an option, 
which would cost $1,583 a 
year. This enhanced plan op-
tion by itself is cheaper than 
the enhanced plan option 
would be if there were two 
plans offered, and, according 
to Lombardi, it became clear 
that this plan was the one to 
go with. 
“If we’re thinking about 
having only one plan, why not 
have it be the enhanced plan? 
It would have manageable co-
pays, it’s easier to understand, 
and it has a $0 deductible for 
mental health, which is really, 
really important to Carnegie 
Mellon’s administration and 
students. It would help the 
Health Center, it would help 
the students, and the campus 
as a whole,” she said.
Unlike those of peer insti-
tutions who have been faced 
with similar insurance plan 
scenarios, the plan would 
still feature coverage for de-
pendents, something that the 
GSA, Casalengo, and Murphy 
felt was important. 
The enhanced plan would 
also put Carnegie Mellon’s 
insurance at the forefront of 
mental health insurance and 
insurance for physical, occu-
pational, and speech therapy, 
according to Lombardi.
Lombardi’s efforts have run 
on a highly condensed time-
line so that UHS would be able 
to roll out the plan this semes-
ter to introduce next year, and 
reception on campus has been 
warm. 
Lombardi presented to the 
GSA two weeks ago and to the 
Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate the same week. In straw 
polls of both bodies, the plan 
was endorsed.
Ian Glasner, student body 
president and senior electri-
cal and computer engineering 
and business administration 
double major, said he was ex-
cited by the prospect. 
“We’re able to reduce costs 
for the enhanced plan and cre-
ate an environment on campus 
where everyone who needs 
healthcare can use Carnegie 
Mellon’s plan to feel safe. It’s 
affordable and effective,” he 
said.
Evan Wineland, Under-
graduate Student Senate 
chair and junior information 
systems major, agreed. “As 
someone who pays for his own 
insurance and someone who 
has had unexpected medi-
cal costs, I sincerely wish that 
I was on the enhanced plan 
instead of the standard plan. 
It takes very little in medical 
costs for the enhanced plan to 
pay off, and it’s the lowest cost 
in-market. It’s a no-brainer,” 
Wineland said. “But, it’s some-
thing that will inevitably have 
a different effect on graduate 
students than undergraduate 
students, because they have 
families.”
The GSA is sensitive to the 
varied needs of its constitu-
ency, according to an email 
from Ph.D. candidate in rheto-
ric and GSA president Carolyn 
Commer. 
The GSA Healthcare Com-
mittee and the GSA Depart-
mental Representatives have 
stated their support of the 
change, but have also ex-
pressed concerns. “The plan 
is more expensive for those 
who used to enroll in the stan-
dard plan, it reduces readily-
available options, and higher 
utilization of [student health 
insurance] could mean higher 
costs in the future, though 
this is hard to predict,” wrote 
Commer.
Commer explained that 
most graduate students pay 
the money for their insurance 
out of pocket. An increase in 
costs would put pressure on 
Ph.D. and master’s students 
without health care stipends 
and graduate students with 
dependents who would have 
to shoulder higher costs.
But, even with those res-
ervations, the GSA endorsed 
the changes, citing the many 
bene?ts the changes would 
prompt, such as simpler pay-
ment processes, lower costs, 
and a more understandable 
option for insurance policies, 
and ?nancial aid to cover the 
cost of the insurance, Commer 
wrote. 
When it comes down to it, 
Lombardi said, it’s a smaller 
cost for a lot more care. 
“It’s heartbreaking for me 
to sit here and hear students 
talk about what they’re going 
through. I know how scary it 
can be to not know how much 
something is going to cost. 
I want us to be a university 
to offer a plan that helps stu-
dents not to worry. You never 
know what’s going to happen, 
and that’s what insurance is 
for: peace of mind,” she said. 
A ?nal decision is expected 
this  week. 
Aetna insurance changes to be decided early this week

Student forums are invaluable to diversity initiatives
On-campus food pantries 
Carnival experience 
The student diversity forums this 
week, hosted by junior global stud-
ies and Hispanic studies double ma-
jor Juan Acosta, were a signi?cant 
student-led effort to approach an 
important campus issue.
Acosta, after publishing an opin-
ion piece in The Tartan expressing 
his concerns, planned the events in 
response to unsatisfactory diversity 
solutions proposed by University 
administration during Town Hall 
meetings for the new Strategic 
Plan. The focus of the forums was 
to broadly discuss diversity, its 
implications, and how Carnegie 
Mellon can be more diverse.
One of the keywords of the 
Strategic Plan is “transformative 
experience,” but a transforma-
tive experience needs to include 
diversity. Students at the forum 
discussed diversity not only in 
terms of race, but also of socioeco-
nomic background, family struc-
ture, sexual orientation, mental 
health, etc.
Individuals come to 
Carnegie Mellon to 
learn and grow, 
but that growth is 
stunted if they never 
meet a person with a 
background different 
from their own. Fac-
ulty and staff, many 
from the Department 
of Student Affairs, at-
tended the events and 
were encouraged to 
listen. Students dis-
cussed their experiences 
with diversity and proposed 
suggestions for the administration. 
The suggestions will be included in 
a letter to the university admin-
istration, in the hopes of adding 
strategies to the Strategic Plan 
for encouraging diversity. These 
measures are not limited to recruit-
ment or admissions; the forum also 
discussed measures that support 
students and encourage them to feel 
comfortable on campus. Suggestions 
included mental health support, dis-
ability resources, and changes in ?-
nancial aid policy.
The Tartan supports the student 
diversity forums and believes that 
Carnegie Mellon students should 
make an effort to participate in the 
discussion. An outline of student 
suggestions will show administra-
tors that students want to contribute 
to the effort and be part of the dis-
cussion about diversity.
In a story in The Wall Street 
Journal on Tuesday, Miriam 
Jordan wrote that since the re-
cession began in 2008, food pan-
tries have been increasing in num-
ber on college campuses.
This willingness to make college 
living easier and more accessible to 
students is commendable for many 
reasons. 
Food security can be a problem 
for college students, who often do 
not have the available resources to 
afford both cost of living and a col-
lege education. Food pantries are an 
ideal way to solve this problem. 
With the cost of tuition, room, 
board, and textbooks soaring in re-
cent years, it has become increasing-
ly dif?cult to afford college. To make 
things worse, the economic recovery 
has 
tak-
en the 
form of 
upwards 
redistribution. 
People who were 
already well off are 
starting to 
get back

“Is it Carnival yet?” asks the pop-
ular Carnegie Mellon student-made 
website. “Almost — but it’s never too 
early to pregame.” 
Thus begins the mythic, magical 
time of Carnival. The four-day holi-
day weekend is arguably the most 
discussed part of Carnegie Mellon’s 
culture. Students treat the weekend 
as a chance to participate in a “real” 
college lifestyle — binge-drinking, 
experimenting with drugs, and par-
tying until the early hours of the 
morning. While the break is certainly 
a welcome respite from the normally 
grueling school year, students should 
reevaluate how they spend their free 
time during Carnival.
Administrators and student lead-
ers work hard to ?ll the four days 
with a slew of events, 
from buggy races to 
networking events to 
shows. 
Alumni and families vis-
iting their students (both from 
the local Pittsburgh community and 
from afar) take advantage of these 
activities and embrace Carnival for 
all that it truly is; students too of-
ten miss out on the early morning 
rolls and late night concerts because 
they’re preoccupied with taking ad-
vantage of the time off to get their 
party on.
“Is it Carnival yet?”
“Almost — but it’s not like you’ll 
remember it anyway.”
The crazed partying is an undeni-
able part of the Carnival lifestyle; af-
ter 
all, it’s 
a cel-
ebration 
of the student body. But what 
shouldn’t be a part of Carnival 
is blacking out, getting sick, 
overindulging, and wasting time 
that should be spent enjoying all 
that our school (in its most relaxed, 
enjoyable state) can offer.
The Tartan urges students all over 
campus to consider how they bud-
get their time this Carnival. Spend 
time relaxing, and partying if that is 
Sex education in U.S. fails to be educational
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
The critique has been made be-
fore: Current sex education pro-
grams are ineffective. While some 
students only receive fear-based in-
formation about sexually transmit-
ted diseases and pregnancy, others 
only learn abstinence and still oth-
ers do not receive sex ed at all.
Not being properly informed 
about human sexuality, reproduc-
tive rights, and sexual assault can 
lead to dif?cult situations, such as 
disease and unwanted pregnancy, 
but also to severe misconceptions 
about sex and sexuality. The way 
that sex education is being 
taught right now 
fails to address human sexuality 
in an open and frank way, which is 
damaging to students as sexual be-
ings.
Sex education as it currently ex-
ists perpetuates sex as a taboo, aside 
from information about anatomy 
and sexually transmitted diseases, 
as well as contraceptives if you’re 
lucky. The discussion of the sexual 
acts themselves, however, is off lim-
its. No health teacher will ever talk 
about the how of sex, so it’s up to 
kids to ?gure it out for themselves.
For young boys, curiosity is “nat-
ural,” according to society. They’re 
excused because “boys will be 
boys” and it’s “just the

What are you doing over Carnival (besides partying)?

CA water restrictions doomed if agriculture won’t conserve
EMMETT ELDRED
Junior Staffwriter
As United States Senator James 
Inhofe (R-Okla.) throws snowballs 
on the Senate ?oor to prove that cli-
mate change doesn’t exist, California 
is facing a climate change crisis. Dry 
weather coupled with warmer than 
average winters have depleted the 
State’s water supplies to dangerous 
levels.
Last week, California Governor 
Jerry Brown enacted tough water 
use regulations, essentially aiming to 
reduce the water use of Californians 
by 25 percent. The restrictions target 
urban water use most heavily, and 
critics point out that the restrictions 
don’t address water use by the agri-
cultural industry at all.
Gov. Brown has defended the 
restrictions, pointing out that Cali-
fornia Agriculture provides a social 
good — food for much of the country 
— while the restrictions target water 
use with little social value, such as 
long showers and aesthetic landscap-
ing.
It’s true: There is a fundamental 
difference between using water to 
grow crops, which feeds people and 
adds to the economy, and using wa-
ter to win the coveted title of “Green-
est Lawn in Beverly Hills,” which 
comes with a lifetime supply of self-
righteousness and the ability to si-
lence the lurking suspicion that your 
worth as a person has little to do with 
the hue of your lawn.
However, California agriculture is 
not the bastion to California’s econ-
omy that defenders claim it is, and 
California’s drought cannot be suc-
cessfully managed without demand-
ing of agriculture the same austerity 
demanded of citizens and other busi-
nesses.
In California, the agricultural in-
dustry accounts for 80 percent of wa-
ter use, which leaves just 20 percent 
to everyone else, including citizens 
and other industries. Choosing to 
restrict the water use of the people 
already using the least amount of wa-
ter is the equivalent to getting your 
meal supersized at McDonald’s and 
offsetting the extra calories by get-
ting a diet soda. Sure, a diet soda is 
“healthier” calorie-wise, but once 
you set foot in McDonald’s, you’ve 
abandoned any pretense that your 
body is a living thing with delicate 
nutritional needs.
Furthermore, agriculture ac-
counts for only 2 percent of Cali-
fornia’s economy. California 
bankrupting its water supplies to ac-
commodate for agriculture’s water 
consumption is not unlike a family 
taking out a second mortgage to pay 
for their gold?sh’s costly arthritis 
medication. Sure, the family will by 
2 percent less happy if Grumpy the 
Gold?sh can’t swim around as glee-
fully as in his youth, but is it really 
worth going into crippling debt? Be-
sides, Grumpy won’t remember the 
sacri?ce you’ve made for him in three 
seconds anyway.
Joking aside, nobody is suggest-
ing that California abandon its agri-
cultural industry to get through this 
drought. California’s economy might 
be able to survive it, but California 
exports more food to the rest of the 
country and to the world than any 
other state.
Still, there are reasonable steps 
that the industry can take to reduce 
water consumption. For instance, 
nearly half of California farmers still 
use the “?ood irrigation” method to 
water crops, even though there are 
far more water-ef?cient irrigation 
methods available. Additionally, Cal-
ifornia has in recent years invested 
heavily in notoriously water-inef?-
cient crops such as almonds, broccoli, 
and alfalfa. Returning to more water-
ef?cient crops will allow the industry 
to reduce water consumption with-
out downsizing production.
Why should students at Carnegie 
Mellon care? Well ?rst of all, if you 
eat, as students occasionally do if 
they have the time, you are probably 
eating something from California. 
This means that a sad, stinky child 
in Fresno has to skip showers to ac-
commodate your insatiable hunger 
for almonds, you monster. California 
agriculture has been exempted from 
water restrictions because of our de-
mand for California products.
But more generally, California’s 
water restrictions are emblematic of 
how problems in America tend to be 
addressed these days. Our solutions 
nibble around the edges and place 
the blame on the powerless, instead 
of expecting the powerful forces ac-
tually causing the problems to lead 
the charge in solving them.
I think Californians who use 20 
percent of the state’s water can rea-
sonably be expected to make sacri-
?ces in their water consumption. But 
shouldn’t the industry using the lion’s 
share of the water be expected to do 
the lion’s share of the conservation?
Though a small factor of the state’s 
economy, agriculture is a major po-
litical power in California. The in-
dustry was one of the largest donors 
to Brown’s campaign. In a slightly 
different context, giving a politician 
money in exchange for political favor 
is called “bribery.” 
At their most innocuous, Brown’s 
water restrictions will prove 
ineffective. 
At their worst, they are the prod-
uct of legalized corruption. Califor-
nians should demand that their gov-
ernor represents their interests, not 
just the interests of his donors.
Autism Speaks doesn’t deserve your donation
JUSTIN MCGOWN 
You would think that an organi-
zation called Autism Speaks would 
be dedicated to sharing the stories 
of people with autism, that it would 
try to improve their educational re-
sources and help others understand 
the need to treat autistic individu-
als with dignity and respect, even 
where communication is dif?cult.
Instead, Autism Speaks seems 
determined to become the blue 
to the Susan G. Komen Memorial 
Foundation’s pink. Last year, Su-
san G. Komen partnered with an oil 
company and announced that they 
had painted a drill bit pink. How 
does a charity supposedly dedicated 
to ?ghting cancer support the ex-
traction of thousands of barrels of 
carcinogens? 
Simple! They’re not actually in-
terested in ?ghting cancer. A very 
small fraction of the money they 
make goes towards research or care; 
most is spent on ads to “raise aware-
ness,” running the foundation, and 
high salaries for its directors.
According to the Autistic Self 
Advocacy Network, a negligible 
amount of money raised by Autism 
Speaks goes towards actually ben-
e?ting people who have autism. 
Only 4 percent of the millions of dol-
lars they raise each year has a direct 
impact on the lives of autistic indi-
viduals and their families.
It is worth noting that they put 
44 percent of their funds into re-
search, but they are largely focused 
on ?nding “cures” for autism or 
genetic markers that with current 
genetic therapies would only allow 
the early termination of an autistic 
fetus. Their research also includes 
examining Omega-3 fatty acids as 
a potential tool in boosting the so-
cial skills of autistic children, which 
sounds more like a fad diet.
Numerous organizations have 
also spoken out against the way that 
Autism Speaks characterizes indi-
viduals with autism, saying it relies 
too heavily on depicting the people 
it claims to be helping as pathetic 
and notable mainly for being a drain 
on the lives of their family members.
Amy Sequenzia, a blogger at 
the Autism Women’s Network who 
herself has autism, goes so far as 
to characterize Autism Speaks as a 
hate group.
While there are, of course, ben-
e?ts to be had from researching the 
causes and mechanisms behind au-
tism, if you are going to give to an 
organization this Autism Awareness 
Month, consider donating to an or-
ganization that spends more money 
on improving the lives of people 
with autism rather than giving them 
?sh oil.

If you haven’t been keeping up 
with the news, Rolling Stone pub-
lished an article last November 
that stirred a national conversa-
tion across college campuses about 
sexual assault. The article detailed a 
harrowing account of a University of 
Virginia student named Jackie and 
her gang rape at a campus fraternity 
house. On Sunday, April 5, Rolling 
Stone retracted the article.
It didn’t take long for reporters 
and readers alike to question Jack-
ie’s account detailed in the original 
article. In December, Rolling Stone’s 
managing editor Will Dana stated, 
“In the face of new information, 
there now appear to be discrepan-
cies in Jackie’s account, and we have 
come to the conclusion that our trust 
in her was misplaced.”
The original story has since been 
taken down from the magazine’s 
website. In its place is the Columbia 
University Graduate School of Jour-
nalism’s report captioned: “An anat-
omy of a journalistic failure.”.
Rolling Stone has ultimately 
shaped the story as a failure to en-
gage in basic journalistic practice. 
The article’s writer, Sabrina Rubin 
Erdely, defended herself: “I allowed 
my concern for Jackie’s well-being, 
my fear of re-traumatizing her, and 
my con?dence in her credibility to 
take the place of more questioning 
and more facts. These are mistakes I 
will not make again.”
I have only a few things to say 
about this: We should show concern 
for sexual assault survivors and con-
sider them credible. Erdely indeed 
failed as a journalist by not ques-
tioning and fact-checking with other 
sources, but her statement can have 
repercussions for many sexual as-
sault survivors and their treatment 
by the media. It’s important to listen 
to survivors and be supportive. Any 
writer can do this while maintaining 
their journalistic principles.
The report published by Columbia 
University’s journalism school also 
details how Erdely could have poten-
tially built a story around other sur-
vivors’ accounts, but felt that Jackie’s 
story would draw in more readers. 
“A Rape on Campus” is one of Rolling 
Stone’s most popular recent stories. 
But you cannot, and shouldn’t even 
try to, rank or compare traumatic 
experiences.
Aside from the journalistic fail-
ures, I fear what effect this retraction 
will have at a greater scale. As news 
that Rolling Stone retracted the ar-
ticle broke Sunday night, I watched 
Facebook posts pop up under the 
“University of Virginia” trending 
feed. One read, “It would be good if 
this Jackie woman could be locked 
away in prison,” and another second-
ed that “the university and fraternity 
have had their reputations ruined.”
Sure, the university and the 
fraternity have had a blow to their 
reputations. People have vandal-
ized and attacked the fraternity in 
question, and the university’s ad-
ministration has scrambled to keep 
up with the backlash. But that’s not 
the point; people are forgetting the 
initial discussion that started in re-
sponse to Jackie’s account.
Sexual assault was and still is a 
serious problem on college campus-
es. In 2013, there were 15 reported 
on-campus sexual assaults at the 
University of Virginia. At Carnegie 
Mellon, the number of reported on-
campus assaults has more than tri-
pled from 2011 to 2013.
When the Rolling Stone article 
was published, other survivors from 
all around the country came forward 
to share their stories. The nation had 
?nally turned its attention to the is-
sue of on-campus sexual assaults, 
but now it seems that the nation has 
lost interest.
Campus assaults are still under-
reported and survivors still need 
support. We’ve made progress as a 
campus with the ever-growing Survi-
vor Support Network (SSN) and the 
work of the administration. To some, 
the Rolling Stone catastrophe is the 
end of it, but it really isn’t. We can’t 
let the discussion die down just as it’s 
beginning.

and be supportive. Any writer can do 
this while maintaining their journalistic 
principles.”

What do you think of when 
you see lightning? While 
watching television, you may 
have noticed that lightning is 
often the backdrop to an eerie 
haunted house. Back in grade 
school, you were probably told 
that Benjamin Franklin, one 
of the Founding Fathers of the 
U.S., ?ew a kite during a light-
ning storm in an effort to study 
electricity. And with the recent 
April forecast, you may have 
had the chance to witness a 
lightning bolt accompanied by 
pouring rain. It is no surprise 
that the supernatural-like ef-
fects of lightning are capable 
of evoking the fear and admi-
ration of mankind, but what 
exactly is the process that gives 
rise to these spectacular dis-
plays of nature?
According to howstuff-
works.com, lightning begins 
with the water cycle, which 
involves the evaporation of 
water into the atmosphere fol-
lowed by the condensation 
of water into clouds. Eventu-
ally, the force of Earth’s gravity 
pulls back the liquid in form of 
precipitation, such as rain or 
snow.
During the condensation 
step of the water cycle, clouds 
contain millions of collid-
ing droplets of water and ice. 
As more moisture enters the 
clouds, the electrons within 
the moisture are knocked 
off. Electrons can also be lost 
when the rising moisture col-
lides with ice and sleet in the 
process of falling back onto 
Earth. In effect, the storm 
cloud acquires a buildup of 
static charge, which involves 
the accumulation of positively 
charged moisture and the 
ripped-off electrons at the top 
and the bottom of the cloud, 
respectively.
In addition to collisions, 
freezing also contributes to the 
polarization of a storm cloud. 
When rising moisture reaches 
higher altitudes, it experiences 
cooler temperatures. This cre-
ates clusters of water drop-
lets with frozen, negatively 
charged water droplets in the 
inner regions. The outer re-
gions of those clusters are un-
frozen, positively charged wa-
ter droplets.
Exposed to rising air cur-
rents, the positively charged 
regions of the cluster are 
ripped off and delivered to the 
top of the cloud. This leaves 
the remaining, frozen droplets 
to gravitate to the bottom part 
of the storm cloud.

Navigation system found to be almost as effective as sight
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Tokyo have discovered 
that blind rats with a geomag-
netic sensor and digital com-
pass attached to their brains 
are able to navigate a maze as 
successfully as rats who can 
see. Each time the blind rats 
moved their heads, the sensors 
generated electrical impulses 
to signal the direction they 
were facing. Subsequently, the 
rats were trained to ?nd pel-
lets in various mazes. Within 
a few days, the blind rats were 
able to navigate the mazes as 
well as rats with normal sight 
vision. The two groups of ro-
dents relied on similar naviga-
tion strategies. This suggested 
that rats could potentially use 
allocentric sense, the sense of 
where the body is relative to 
the environment, to replace 
vision.
The research was pub-
lished in Current Biology, and 
it is thought that such ?nd-
ings will be helpful in assisting 
blind people to independently 
navigate their surroundings. 
“The most plausible applica-
tion is to attach a geomagnetic 
sensor to a cane so that the 
blind person can know the di-
rection via tactile signals such 
as vibration,” said Yuji Ikega-
ya, a researcher from the Uni-
versity of Tokyo and co-author 
of the study.

Physicists learn about  geographic tongue condition
Geographic tongue (GT) is 
a condition where red patches 
appear when ?liform papillae 
on the tongue are lost. GT af-
fects approximately 2 percent 
of the global population, but 
its exact cause is unknown. 
Gabriel Seiden, a research-
er from the Weizmann Insti-
tute of Science, and So?a Cur-
land, a researcher from the 
Max Planck Institute for the 
Physics of Complex Systems, 
noticed similarities between 
GT and other phenomenon 
like cardiac arrhythmias. 
Using mathematical mod-
els, the researchers were able 
to model the disease as a dy-
namic system that involved a 
healed state, in?amed state, 
and a recovering state. This 
model, termed the cellular 
automaton model, was pub-
lished in the New Journal of 
Physics.
 The model accounted for 
the presence of multiple le-
sions of different sizes ex-
panding on the epithelium 
simultaneously and merging 
upon contact, thus leading to 
highly irregular patterns. 
Still, Seiden admitted that 
“we do not know exactly how 
spiral patterns form in GT pa-
tients due to lack of careful 
clinical studies on initiation 
and evolution of different pat-
terns.”

Plague hits prairie dogs and changes various ecosystems
The same bacterium that 
caused the Black Death a few 
hundred years ago, Yersinia 
pestis, now rarely infects peo-
ple in North America. How-
ever, it has caused the death 
of many black-tailed prairie 
dogs. This has the potential to 
be a serious problem for the 
ecosystem. A variety of other 
species rely on the existence 
of prairie dogs, so the disap-
pearance of the species has 
the potential to compromise 
the overall health of the eco-
system. Speci?cally, prairie 
dog predators will be affected, 
but animals that use prairie 
dog burrows and grass pat-
terns will also be drastically 
affected by the diminishing 
population.
“The connection between 
these animals and plants will 
be distorted and even broken,” 
said David Eads, a professor 
from Colorado State Univer-
sity. To correct this issue, Eads 
and his colleagues are search-
ing for new ways to control the 
spread of Yersinia pestis. They 
are currently testing an insec-
ticide that may be able to re-
duce the number of ?eas, thus 
making the plague less infec-
tious. “If we can’t control the 
problem, the grasslands are 
probably going to be far differ-
ent within the next 100 years,” 
Eads said.

Smartphone data provides warnings of earthquakes
New research by Jawbone, 
a consumer technology and 
wearable device company, 
shows that sensors in smart-
phones can give early warn-
ings of an earthquake. Re-
cent analysis of data from an 
earthquake that took place 
last August in California indi-
cated that smartphones with 
GPS sensors may reveal a lot 
of information right before an 
earthquake. On an ordinary 
day, we use GPS to map our 
way to a store, but GPS sys-
tems can also sense a sudden 
lurch in one direction. In the 
context of an earthquake, such 
a lurch sensed by many people 
at once could indicate a seis-
mic shift. Benjamin Brooks, a 
researcher at the Earthquake 
Science Center, along with 
various colleagues, has test-
ed what crowdsourced GPS 
data might look like in a real 
earthquake. With simulations 
of real-life earthquakes that 
occurred before, such as the 
earthquake in Japan in 2011, 
the researchers have gathered 
data that suggests data from 
around 5000 people would be 
enough to spot the beginnings 
of a major earthquake. This 
would leave approximately 
?ve seconds to warn major 
populations, which could 
make a difference in the way 
populations respond.

SpaceX to launch reusable rocket again on Monday
SpaceX plans to launch the 
robotic Dragon cargo capsule 
to the International Space 
Station (ISS) using a Falcon 9 
rocket on April 13, as part of 
a $1.6 billion NASA contract. 
The Monday launch will be 
the sixth of twelve cargo mis-
sions to the ISS incorporated 
in the contract. 
The goal of the launch is to 
send Dragon toward the ISS 
and then bring the ?rst stage 
of the Falcon 9 rocket back to 
Earth for a soft touchdown on 
an unmanned drone ship in 
the Atlantic Ocean.
SpaceX attempted the 
same reusable-rocket Dragon 
cargo launch earlier this year. 
The mission failed because af-
ter the Falcon 9 rocket hit the 
drone ship it exploded on the 
deck. It is thought that this oc-
cured because the rocket ran 
out of hydrolic ?uid before 
safely landing on the ship.
SpaceX CEO Elon Musk 
vowed to ?x that particular 
issue in time “for the next at-
tempt.” Monday’s test is part 
of SpaceX’s effort to develop 
fully and rapidly reusable 
rockets, which, according to 
Musk, would reduce the cost 
of space?ight by a factor of 
100 if successful.

Imagine having to de-
scribe the world you live in 
using only images of land-
marks. If you could only 
choose ten, what would you 
pick? A sentimental feature 
of your hometown? A his-
toric relic? A fading natural 
landmark? Over the years, 
a myriad of historians and 
individuals have recorded 
their own interpretations of 
the world they live in, pro-
viding future generations 
with a brief glimpse into the 
past through the eyes of an-
other. But is there a way to 
merge these unique studies 
into a universal perspective 
of our world? William Alba, 
the director of the Science 
and Humanities Scholars 
Program at Carnegie Mellon 
University, has been working 
towards this goal with a proj-
ect called Earth Tapestry.
The Earth Tapestry proj-
ect aims to determine the 
most important landmarks 
on Earth, both natural and 
manmade. Once this infor-
mation has been collected, 
it will be archived on the 
moon, in the hope that one 
day it will provide individu-
als with an understanding of 
the Earth as it was in previ-
ous eras. “The way we’ve 
done this sort of archiving 
in the past has leaned pretty 
heavily on the work of indi-
viduals and of committees,” 
Alba said. “But what we say 
about ourselves as a society 
is something that should 
be decided by as large of a 
group as possible.”
In order to involve a large 
number of people, Alba 
wanted to use a website 
where people could vote on 
individual locations. This 
data would then be convert-
ed into a general ranking.
“The basic problem was 
how to get people’s individ-
ual preferences converted 
over into a collective group 
preference,” Alba explained. 
By collaborating with re-
searchers at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) media lab, Alba was 
able to create a website, 
www.earthtapestry.org, that 
could produce the required 
group preference. On the 
website, each voter is shown 
two images of landmarks 
from around the world, such 
as the Sahara, the Palace of 
Versailles, or the Carnegie 
Museum of Natural Histo-
ry. They are then asked to 
choose which image best 
represents a displayed ad-
jective. For instance, a voter 
might be asked whether the 
Empire State Building or the 
Musée d’Orsay is more awe-
inspiring.
As these comparisons 
are completed, an algorithm 
similar to the TrueSkill al-
gorithm, a ranking system 
developed by Microsoft 
Research, is used in order 
to convert the data into a 
generalized ranking. Alba 
compared Earth Tapestry’s 
voting and ranking proce-
dure with sports rankings. 
In team sports, multiple pair-
wise comparisons are made 
between teams, which even-
tually results in a ranking 
system, despite the fact that 
not every team plays every 
other team. Similarly, the 
Earth Tapestry system uses 
pair-wise comparisons in or-
der to generate a ranking of 
important locations, without 
forcing every voter to com-
pare every location.
Along with ranking 
Earth’s important land-
marks, the Earth Tapestry 
project also aims to preserve

HCII hosts seminar on technology and creativity

Joel Brandt, a senior re-
search scientist and engi-
neering manager at Adobe 
Research, led a seminar 
hosted by Carnegie Mellon’s 
Human-Computer Interac-
tion Institute last Wednesday. 
Brandt is a part of the Cre-
ative Technologies Lab, one 
of three separate labs that to-
gether form Adobe Research. 
As part of the Creative Tech-
nologies Lab, Brandt, along 
with other researchers, en-
gineers, and entrepreneurs, 
works toward creating tools 
that help designers, develop-
ers, and educators.
In the seminar, Brandt 
stressed the dual nature of 
Adobe Research, which fo-
cuses both on improving Ado-
be products and on academic 
achievements. “We want 
people to create things that 
impact our customers’ lives, 
and we want people to cre-
ate things that increase the 
world’s knowledge,” Brandt 
said. Aside from improv-
ing Adobe products, Adobe 
Research often focuses on 
academic work by publishing 
papers, interacting with uni-
versities, and aiding gradu-
ate students with their work. 
According to Brandt, roughly 
one out of four projects at 
Adobe Research has an actual 
impact on customers of Ado-
be, approximately half of the 
results found in studies are 
published into papers, and 
the rest of the studies done 
at Adobe Research do not 
have a substantial impact on 
a grander scale.
During the seminar, 
Brandt focused on discussing 
examples of the numerous 
research projects that have 
come out of the research 
labs. Some of the works that 
Brandt has worked on in-
clude Blueprint, a plug-in for 
Adobe Flash Builder that al-
lows users to query the web 
for Adobe Flex and Adobe 
Flash code samples directly 
inside development environ-
ments. This plug-in allows for 
developers to quickly search 
for results with less friction.
 In a study conducted by 
Google, researchers found 
that even 100 millisecond de-
lays of returning information 
impact users of a product. 
Adobe’s Blueprint feature fo-
cuses on this study to deliver 
search results in a quick and 
effective manner. After devel-
oping this tool, the lab con-
ducted surveys and studies 
on the actual implementation 
of the tool to see whether or 
not they could see improve-
ments. In this particular 
case, the study was able to 
see improvements not only in 
time, but also quality of code.
Adobe Research also 
worked on Brackets, a code 
editor that focuses on code 
for the web, along with The-
seus, an extension of Brack-
ets that debugs JavaScript 
code. Brackets has features 
speci?c to the languages of 
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
For example, Live Preview 
is a feature that allows for 
a user to easily preview the 
display of their generated 
code on a web browser. Users 
can also make live edits and 
see their immediate changes 
display on the web browser. 
Brackets runs on an open 
source environment that can 
be easily accessed by any user 
on the web, meaning that 
software updates of Brack-
ets and future developments 
involving Brackets not only 
come from Adobe develop-
ers and researchers, but also 
anyone interested in chang-
ing or adding features to the 
software.
Brandt has also been 
involved with Adobe Pho-
toshop’s Project Recess, a 
brand-new user environment 
that is speci?cally directed 
towards web designers. 
The project has yet to be 
released, but it aims to help 
designers easily access the 
changes that they want made 
to their works. The project 
started off as an idea that 
a researcher had, but was 
fostered into a project that 
has now gained momentum. 
Brandt commented that this 
type of excitement is seen at 
Adobe Research labs often 
because of their open and 
collaborative environment 
that allows for ?exibility in 
the projects of researchers.
All of these tools men-
tioned, in addition to many 
more projects and develop-
ments at Adobe Research, 
enable the creativity of oth-
ers. Members in Adobe Re-
search, like Joel Brandt, work 
towards improving the user 
experience so that the users 
themselves can focus on cre-
ativity and designs.

Iranian Nuclear Agreement reduces chance of nuclear war
PUGWASH COLUMN
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Staffwriter
Pugwash discussed an is-
sue close to the organization’s 
roots this week: the Iranian 
nuclear deal.
The purpose of the very 
?rst Pugwash conference was 
to discuss the implications of 
nuclear weapons. It was orga-
nized in 1957, as a response 
to a manifesto published in 
1955 by Bertrand Russell and 
Albert Einstein. The manifesto 
warned against the dangers of 
weapons of mass destruction, 
and while it acknowledged the 
dif?culty in eliminating war, 
it encouraged nations to solve 
problems non-violently and 
urged the world to “Remember 
your humanity, and forget the 
rest.”
The manifesto was signed 
by 11 leading scientists at 
the time, and two years later, 
philanthropist Cyrus Eaton 
offered his land in Pugwash, 
Nova Scotia as a location for 
the conference. Today’s stu-
dent organizations are a con-
tinuation of the original mis-
sion of creating discussion 
around the social and ethical 
implications of science and 
technology.
The topic of weapons of 
mass destruction is now just 
one of many issues that Pug-
wash discusses, but it is a little 
sobering to think that more 
than 50 years down the road 
from the ?rst conference, we 
are still struggling to bring na-
tions together diplomatically 
and lower the risk of a nuclear 
war.
To begin our discussion 
this week, we watched an in-
terview with President Barack 
Obama, who discussed his 
strategy in re-opening rela-
tionships with countries like 
Cuba and Iran. His main ar-
gument was that the United 
States is strong enough that it 
doesn’t lose anything by trying 
to talk and normalize relation-
ships with other countries. Just 
talking doesn’t diminish the 
United States’ military power, 
nor does it take any options off 
the table, if the other countries 
were to be uncooperative.
The agreement reached 
with Iran over their nuclear 
program is one outcome of 
such normalization. It has sev-
en planks: 1) Iran will never 
be within a year of building a 
nuclear weapon. 2) No more 
sanctions, by the UN or the US. 
3) About a third of Iran’s cen-
trifuges that are used to enrich 
fuel that could be used in a 
weapon will be dismantled. 4) 
A limit on how much enriched 
uranium Iran can keep will be 
imposed. 5) Certain nuclear 
plants will be shut down for 
at least 15 years. 6) No secret 
facilities. 7) Aggressive and 
intrusive inspections by the 
International Atomic Energy 
Agency.
For Iran, the most impor-
tant issue is lifting sanctions. 
The sanctions currently in 
place are causing immense 
amounts of trouble for the av-
erage citizen of Iran, includ-
ing reduced food security, a 
broken healthcare system, and 
unsafe travel. The removal 
of sanctions would be a huge 
boon to the economy and qual-
ity of life inside Iran.
However, Israel has a lot of 
problems with anything that 
could be seen as helping Iran, 
as the two countries have been 
extremely unfriendly toward 
each other. Although they 
have not of?cially claimed 
to have nuclear weapons, it 
is widely known that Israel 
is in fact a nuclear state, and 
the possibility of Iran gaining 
nuclear weapons is incredibly 
frightening to Israel.

nuclear proliferation has

the discovered information. 
This will be done in a variety of 
ways, namely by archiving the 
information on the moon. On 
May 1, the existing data will be 
supplied to the Carnegie Mel-
lon Moon Arts Group, which 
will be in charge of transfer-
ring the data to the moon. 
Voting will remain open after 
May 1, but any new data will 
not be archived. The existing 
data will be laser-engraved on a 
sapphire disk, coated in alumi-
num and enclosed in sheets of 
metal. This unit will be placed 
in a chamber of the Astrobotic 
Technology lunar lander, which 
is set to arrive on the moon in 
late 2015 or early 2016. The 
chamber will also house three 
other information preservation 
projects entitled Sagan Planet 
Walk: Moon, Epoch Marker, 
and Signed Sealed Delivered. 
Aside from sending the data to 
the moon, the data will also be 
stored in deep digital archives.
Fundamentally, Earth Tap-
estry is an extremely interdisci-
plinary project. In order to pre-
serve the more artistic side of 
the project, images of the land-
marks with the highest rank-
ings will be displayed in the 
College of Fine Arts at Carnegie 
Mellon in 2016 as part of the 
College of Fine Arts centennial 
celebration. Throughout the 
year the images will be rotated, 
with higher ranked landmarks 
being displayed for longer peri-
ods of time.
Alba hopes the project will 
continue once the data has 
been archived. 
“I would like to have Earth 
Tapestry continue not just on 
one location on the moon, but 
on several,” Alba said. “Redun-
dancy is good if you want to 
preserve information. If others 
keep on sending things to the 
moon and to Mars, I would like 
to continue to send out volumes 
of Earth Tapestry, because our 
opinions of the world will 
change.”

of charges within the cloud 
determines the strength of 
the surrounding electric ?eld. 
With adequate strength, the 
electric ?eld can repel elec-
trons that are present on the 
ground, driving these elec-
trons deep into the Earth.
 In turn, the surface of the 
Earth becomes more positive-
ly charged, contributing the 
polarity of charge between 
the ground and the storm 
clouds.
As the electric ?eld grows 
stronger, the air surround-
ing the cloud becomes ion-
ized. Through the process 
of ionization, electrons are 
removed from the molecules 
of the nonionized air. What 
would have originally been 
an insulator — resistant 
against the ?ow of charge — 
transforms into plasma, or 
ionized air. The conductive 
property of plasma allows 
for the free ?ow of electrons 
from the cloud to the ground.
Lightning bolts start off 
with the formation of step 
leaders, which are paths of 
ionized air that branch in the 
direction of Earth. Identi?ed 
by their faint, purplish glow, 
step leaders provide media 
through which electrons 
from the bottom of the cloud 
can pass. While it is not clear 
why these paths have zigzag 
shapes, it is thought to be a 
result of differing levels of 
electrical conductivity within 
the air, caused by the pres-
ence of dust particles and oth-
er impurities within the air. 
Not to be confused with an 
actual lightning strike, step 
leaders serve to map out the 
path in which the strike will 
travel through. Meanwhile, 
the electric ?elds cause the 
propagation of streamers, or 
surges of positive charge from 
objects on the Earth. Like step 
leaders, they also display a 
purplish glow, but with more 
distinct edges.
When a step leader comes 
into contact with a streamer, 
the ionized air seals the con-
nection between the cloud 
and the Earth. When light-
ning strikes, a discharge of 
current ?ows through this 
path, allowing for positive 
and negative charges to trav-
el to opposite sides. Hence, 
lightning can be thought as 
Mother Nature’s way of neu-
tralizing the imbalance of 
charge between the cloud 
and the Earth.
In addition, when the cur-
rent ?ows between the leader 
and streamer, an enormous 
amount of heat is produced. 
With a temperature even 
higher than the surface of the 
sun, the heat of the lightning 
bolt creates its characteristic, 
brilliant white-blue ?ash. At 
the same time, the surround-
ing air explodes from the in-
tensity of the heat, causing a 
shock wave that leads to the 
production of thunder. Once 
the main strike of lightning 
occurs, it is quickly followed 
by 30 to 40 secondary strikes. 
Occurring in rapid succes-
sion, secondary strikes can 
elongate the length of time 
the original strike appears 
to be present. A time delay 
between the original and 
secondary also creates the 
illusion that the main strike 
is ?ickering. From ionization 
to the moment of strike, it is 
surprising to think that the 
process of lightning occurs 
within a mere fraction of a 
second.
Despite its eerie beauty, 
lightning is de?nitely some-
thing to avoid. The National 
Weather Service estimates 
that in the U.S., 330 people 
are struck by lightning every 
year, including 55 deaths. 
Hence, it is important to be 
aware of precautions against 
the fatal effects of lightning. 
During the event of a light-
ning storm, it is important to 
take approriate shelter areas, 
such as a building or car. It is 
never a good idea to hide un-
der a tree, which can attract 
lightning. While indoors, you 
should avoid using phones 
with cords or coming into 
contact with indoor pipes 
that may be made out of met-
al.
Lightning is probably one 
of the most powerful exhibit 
of electrostatics that nature 
has to offer. In fact, the sight 
of it can be safely appreciated 
from the comfort of your own 
home. And while the warm 
months continue to roll on, 
a lightning storm can create 
adventure out of what could 
have easily been another 
rainy day.
Pugwash had about pollu-
tion and the responsibility 
of climate change. Nations 
like the United States got the 
nuclear bomb, and then de-
cided that no one else could 
have it, similar to how they 
used natural resources ir-
responsibly and gained the 
bene?ts, but now are urging 
other nations to be more re-
strained in the pollution and 
resource use.
One of the biggest dis-
agreements among Pugwash 
members was with the idea 
of mutually assured destruc-
tion. Conventional wisdom 
says that if two enemy na-
tions both have nuclear 
weapons, neither will actual-
ly use the weapons, because 
they are sure to be destroyed 
as well. However, does this 
actually hold? If an irra-
tional, radical government 
came to power or a group of 
extremists got their hands 
on a nuclear weapon, would 
they really hold back due 
to the assurance that they 
would be destroyed as well?
However, it was also dis-
cussed that if it was a true 
deterrent to nuclear war, 
wouldn’t it be better for both 
Israel and Iran to have nucle-
ar weapons? Also, wouldn’t it 
be more fair? However, the 
idealistic notion of fairness 
was quickly countered with 
the idea of realpolitik, which 
supposes that you can never 
know what others are do-
ing, and therefore, nations 
should always look out for 
themselves.
In this case, applying a 
realpolitik analysis shows 
that if Iran were to get the 
bomb, Saudi Arabia would 
also acquire nuclear weapons 
from Pakistan, as Saudi Ara-
bia isn’t an ally of Iran, but is 
allied with Pakistan, which 
has the bomb. In addition, 
a handful of other countries 
would also feel extremely 
threatened, as Iran isn’t 
friends with many nations in 
the Middle East, due to their 
sponsored terrorism in Leba-
non, Syria, and Yemen, to 
name a few places. This con-
?ict has an underlying cause 
in both religion and ethnici-
ty, as Iran is made up of most-
ly Shia Muslims, which are in 
con?ict with Sunni Muslims, 
who make up the majority of 
many other countries in the 
region. Also, most Iranians 
are ethnically Persian, while 
residents of other countries 
are either Arab, or, in the 
case of Israel, Jewish.
Regardless of members’ 
faith in the mutually assured 
destruction as a deterrent to 
nuclear war, almost every-
one thought that it would be 
bad if Iran got nuclear weap-
ons. As the recent outline of 
an agreement on a nuclear 
deal with Iran seems to de-
crease that chance, through 
reduced capabilities and 
more oversight on those ca-
pabilities, and with the origi-
nal Pugwash conference in 
mind, most Pugwash mem-
bers seemed to agree that it 
was a step in the right direc-
tion.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This 
article is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on the Ira-
nian  Nuclear Agreement.

Women’s Golf
On Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s golf team 
competed in the Westmin-
ster Spring Invitational. The 
Tartans won the event with 
a team score of 370 in the 18 
-hole event.
The team of ?rst-years 
was led by Summer Kitahara, 
who placed second overall 
individually, shooting an 82. 
Robin Tan and Emma Hoskins 
?nished second and third for 
Carnegie Mellon, 10th and 
11th overall, shooting a 93 and 
94 respectively. The Tartans 
will next compete Tuesday at 
the Saint Vincent Spring Invi-
tational.
Men’s Tennis
The 10th-ranked Carn-
egie Mellon men’s tennis 
team played a home match 
against 18th-ranked Univer-
sity of Mary Washington on 
Saturday.
The Tartans jumped out 
to the early lead with a 3–0 
sweep of doubles. Sophomore 
Kenny Zhang and ?rst year Ed-
ward Ang, along with the team 
of senior Bryce Beisswanger 
and junior Yuvraj Kumar, won 
their matches easily, 8–4 and 
8–5, respectively. Seniors Will 
Duncan and Christian He-
aney-Secord fought hard from 
the number 1 doubles spot 
and pulled out the 9–7 victory.
Spotting an early lead from 
doubles play, the Tartans 
cruised to victory by splitting 
the singles matches. Heaney-
Secord, sophomore Kunal 
Wadwani, and junior Abhishek 
Alla each won in straight sets 
with Heaney-Secord and Wad-
wani each winning 6–1, 6–4 
and Alla winning 6–4, 6–4.
Carnegie Mellon also host-
ed 11th-ranked Johns Hopkins 
on Sunday.
Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
and women’s track teams split 
up this weekend with the dis-
tance runner competing in the 
Bucknell Distance Carnival.
At Bucknell, the Tartans 
faced off against the top dis-
tance completion in the coun-
try. Six women set career bests 
with seniors Erin Kiekhaefer 
and Sara Kelly each running 
the 1,500-meter run. Kiekhae-
fer competed in the top invita-
tional ?eld and ?nished 23rd 
with a personal best time of 
4:39.89, and Kelly competed 
in the unseeded ?eld, placing 
2nd in her heat and 22nd over-
all with her career-best time of 
4:52.78.
The other four career bests 
came in the 5000-meter run 
with junior Sophie Lohmann 
placing 11th overall, fellow 
junior Rekha Schnepf ?nish-
ing 19th, sophomore Zo?a 
Tillman placing 26th and ju-
nior Kira Ragazzo ?nishing 
37th with times of 18:04.81, 
18:25.43,18:32.00,and 
18:52.93, respectively.
For the men, sophomore 
Owen Norley had a career 
best in the 1,500-meter run, 
placing third in the unseeded 
?eld with a time of 3:55.62. 
In the 5000-meter run, an-
other group of Tartans earned 
career bests with sophomore 
Ryan Archer placing 4th, ?rst 
year Ryan Auld ?nishing 17th, 
junior Brian Bollens placing 
22nd, and senior Eamon Cul-
linane ?nishing 27th in the 
unseeded ?eld with times of 
14:51.68, 15:03.52, 15:05.00 
and 15:06.47, respectively.
Rounding out the day for 
the Tartans was senior George 
Degen, who set a school re-
cord in the 10,000-meter with 
a time of 30:13.03, placing 
seventh in the invitation heat.
The other parts of the two 
Carnegie Mellon squads com-
peted in the Westminster Col-
lege Invitational, but results 
are not yet available at the 
time of print.
The Tartans will compete 
as full teams again on Sat-
urday at the Slippery Rock 
Invitational.

SPORTS BRIEFS
EPL Champions League heats upslip-away games. On a per-
sonal note, Quiros feels that 
she needs to lead the mid?eld 
more and be more prominent 
offensively.
Quiros has had some 
great motivation and support 
from within the team. Dur-
ing Quiros’ ?rst year, she was 
nurtured in her position by ex-
captain Stephanie Hare. This 
complemented Coach Stru-
ble’s attempts to introduce a 
more offensive mindset into 
Quiros’ play. Quiros also culti-
vated a great relationship with 
classmate Alli McGugan, a ju-
nior business administration 
and decision science double 
major who plays forward for 
Carnegie Mellon. Currently 
roommates, the girls are there 
for each other on the ?eld and 
off, constantly supporting and 
driving each other.
Quiros is at Carnegie Mel-
lon for a lot more than its 
soccer program. Having ?rst 
looked at a number of Ivy 
League schools, Quiros dis-
liked that all of them had ath-
letes seen as less academical-
ly-minded than everyone else. 
When she visited Pitts-
burgh, she realized that while 
every other school she had 
visited possessed some ?aw 
either in lifestyle or in educa-
tional programs, the combina-
tion of Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh proved to be a per-
fect match. 
She was attracted to the 
strong writing program and its 
speci?city in individual ?elds. 
During her time at Carnegie 
Mellon, Quiros has been es-
pecially impressed that all its 
students perform at such a 
high level over a wide variety 
of ?elds, which she says can 
be pressuring but exciting.
There are days when aca-
demic or other woes put you 
off your game, and Quiros ap-
preciates that the coaches are 
very understanding of that. 
She appreciates that practices 
provide a place to hone skills, 
a great outlet, and a place to 
meet and connect with diverse 
groups of girls across ma-
jors and grades all of whom, 
on some level, share similar 
experiences and interests.
It is a rare occasion to come 
across a player so well-round-
ed both on the ?eld and off of 
it, and especially humbling to 
see such a player continue to 
want to grow and expand her 
skill set. 
Indeed, it is this that sets 
Quiros apart from most oth-
er athletes and give her the 
markings of a leader. Given 
her dedication and that of the 
team, there is great reason to 
be excited about the Tartan’s 
next season.
MIDFIELDER, from A12
the rut. They lost away to 
Crystal Palace last weekend, 
which dropped them into 
fourth below their neighbors 
Manchester United, who go 
into their clash on Sunday as 
favorites for the three points. 
This, coupled with the South-
ampton and Liverpool both 
only 5 and 6 points behind, 
respectively, means City must 
get their act together soon or 
risk being out of the Champi-
ons League next season.
Prediction: Fifth. They are 
very likely to lose the game 
against United, and while 
their ?xtures get easier from 
there, their inconsistency 
and the age of their squad 
will show up and a young and 
hungry side will pass them.
Liverpool
Brendan Rodgers was be-
ing praised as a genius for 
turning around Liverpool’s 
fortunes. Top four seemed 
like a dream that could be 
achieved. This was all before 
the game against Manches-
ter United, where Liverpool 
came crashing down to Earth. 
That loss, 2–1 at home, com-
pletely demoralized this team 
and was a huge setback for 
a club that had taken giant 
strides into becoming a force 
again last season. Arsenal 
seemed to have put the ?nal 
nail in the cof?n with a rout 
last week before Man City did 
them a favor and lost their 
game too. They beat Black-
burn at Edwood Park to stay 
in the FA Cup and gained a 
little momentum back. Rod-
gers is a good manager; he 
seems to have learned from 
his mistakes last season, and 
their easy remaining ?xtures 
mean that they have a good 
chance to leapfrog a free-
falling Manchester City into 
fourth.
Prediction: Fourth. Yes, 
it’s a stretch to suggest they 
have the mettle to do it. But if 
they do not drop easy points 
and if City continue their 
free-fall, which seems likely, 
there’s a high chance this 
could be the outcome.
Southampton and 
Tottenham Hotspurs
These are two clubs that 
are both on the outside of this 
race, but still have a chance 
of ?nishing there — huge 
credit to Southampton for 
being only 5 points off fourth 
at this stage of the season 
after the ?re sale they went 
through over the summer. 
Spurs should arguably be do-
ing better with all the money 
they have spent over the last 
few seasons, but with a new 
manager, Mauricio Pochet-
tino, in place and players like 
Harry Kane, who has been 
the breakout star of the sea-
son, Ryan Mason and Nabil 
Bentaleb getting their ?rst 
full season of top-?ight foot-
ball under their belt, they are 
in a good position going for-
ward. Neither club is likely 
to ?nish fourth or even ?fth, 
but there is still one Europa 
League spot to ?ght for.
Prediction: Southamp-
ton — sixth. They are cur-
rently in good form with the 
best defensive record in the 
division. A safe bet to not 
drop enough points to lose 
position. Spurs — seventh. 
Their loss to Aston Villa at 
home this weekend ruined 
their chances of ?ghting for 
top four, and with players 
burning out at this stage, 
it’s unlikely they will beat 
Southampton into sixth.

CMU athletes Serbin, Kitahara, and Qian honored by ECAC 
BRADEN KELNER
Contributing Editor
The Eastern College Athlet-
ic Conference (ECAC) award-
ed Carnegie Mellon athletes 
for achievements both on the 
basketball court and the golf 
course this month.
Among those awarded 
were sophomore forward Jack 
Serbin on the men’s basket-
ball team, ?rst-year Summer 
Kitahara on the women’s golf 
team, and sophomore George 
Qian on the men’s golf team.
Jack Serbin
The ECAC named Serbin 
to its Division III Men’s South 
Basketball All-Star Second 
Team, coming on the heels of 
an announcement that he was 
also named to the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Second Team.
Serbin ranked ?fth in the 
UAA in blocked shots, with 73 
total, according to a university 
news release. He achieved a 
career best of seven blocked 
shots against the Penn State 
Beavers this season. In all but 
one game this season, Serbin 
scored double-digit points. 
Out of the 24 double-digit 
games, he scored more than 
20 points in eight of them. 
During one of those games, 
against New York University, 
Serbin shot a career-high 31 
points.
Serbin is the ?rst university 
athlete to receive postseason 
honors from the ECAC since 
Ryan Einwag (TSB, ’09), the 
second-leading scorer in the 
university’s history, who is 
now an equity derivatives 
trader at IMC Financial Mar-
kets, according to his LinkedIn 
pro?le.
Overall, the men’s bas-
ketball team went 14–11 this 
season, winning nine of their 
games at home.
Summer Kitahara
The ECAC named Kitahara 
Women’s Rookie Golfer of the 
Month for Division III after she 
placed ?fth with a score of 161 
overall at the Inaugural UAA 
Women’s Golf Championship 
in Sorrento, Fla., earning her 
All-UAA ?rst-team honors, ac-
cording to a university news 
release.
She later shot 242 for three 
rounds at the 2015 Jekyll Is-
land Collegiate Invitational at 
Jekyll Island, Ga., bringing her 
average for all ?ve rounds be-
tween the championship and 
invitational to 80.6. Through 
12 rounds this year, she has 
averaged a score of 80.7, ac-
cording to the university’s ath-
letics website.
Carnegie Mellon placed 
?rst on Saturday with a team 
score of 370 at the Westmin-
ster Spring Invitational. Ki-
tahara led the team with a 
score of 82.
George Qian
Qian was named Men’s 
Golfer of the Month by the 
ECAC for Division III sports 
after claiming the UAA indi-
vidual medalist honor at the 
UAA Championships in Sor-
rento, Fla. last month. He 
scored two rounds of 74 at 
the tournament. At the Jekyll 
Island Collegiate Invitational, 
he scored 223 between three 
rounds.
Qian came in at an average 
score of 74.2 for all ?ve rounds 
between both events. Through 
14 rounds this year, Qian has 
an average score of 74.6, ac-
cording to the university’s ath-
letics website.
Carnegie Mellon placed 
?rst on Sunday at the Edward 
Jones Shootout in Apollo, Pa 
with a combined score of 295. 
Qian placed second in the en-
tire event and ?rst on the team 
with a total score of 71.

ANDY BIRLA
Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
Women’s Soccer team had an 
especially strong season with 
important contributions from 
all their players. However, the 
in?uence of one mid?elder 
in particular served as part 
of the teams’s driving force 
when getting the ball into 
the opponent’s net. Carson 
Quiros is a junior professional 
writing and creative writing 
double major who plays cen-
tral mid?eld for the Tartans. 
She put together a phenom-
enal season, starting in 18 
games and notching 9 shots 
on goal, 2 of which got past 
the keeper to make game-
winning goals.
Her performances earned 
her a spot on the All-Universi-
ty Athletic Association (UAA) 
Second Team and the Nation-
al Soccer Coaches Association 
of America All-Scholar All-
Region Third Team. Despite 
all of that, her importance on 
the ?eld cannot be expressed 
in numbers, owing to the fact 
that she serves not only as a 
strong defensive player but 
also a facilitator and moti-
vator to unleashing the full 
potential of the teammates 
around her. Behind every 
great player lies a remarkable 
story, and Quiros’ story con-
?rms that.
The youngest of four sib-
lings, Quiros started off play-
ing soccer at the tender age of 
3. She credits her parents for 
giving her the opportunity by 
putting all four siblings in rec-
reational sports. Quiros’ tal-
ent and skill in the sport were 
noticed early as she made 
the club’s A-team in the ?fth 
grade. Her commitment to 
the sport only increased from 
there on out as she narrowed 
down her sports to just bas-
ketball and soccer, dropping 
softball and gymnastics.
In spite of her overwhelm-
ing dedication to soccer, 
Quiros presented great ath-
letic potential and was part of 
her school’s varsity basketball 
team alongside being part of 
the school’s varsity soccer 
team and her club’s soccer 
team. Her brilliance as part of 
her club, Top Hat (an all-girls 
club in Atlanta), attracted the 
attention of Carnegie Mellon 
Head Coach Yon Struble. Ever 
since she was recruited by 
Struble, Quiros has developed 
a strong relationship with the 
coach that has helped her 
expand on her potential and 
grow as a player by capitaliz-
ing on skills that she already 
had while also cultivating 
new ones. Quiros’ formidable 
understanding of the game 
stems greatly from the fact 
that, over the years, she has 
played in positions ranging 
from a defender to a forward, 
eventually settling down as a 
central mid?elder.
When asked about the 
team’s fantastic performance 
this season, Quiros credited 
it to the extensive amount 
of preparation that the team 
goes through during their 
preseason and the summer, 
which makes the regular sea-
son more manageable. She 
also acknowledged that the 
team used their speed and 
their technical knowledge to 
dominate its games. Follow-
ing a disappointing season 
last year, Quiros said that 
the team didn’t build expec-
tations for this season and 
focused on playing their best 
every game while still staying 
humble.
The difference was de?-
nitely visible; the team came 
out swinging this season and 
won some spectacular games 
against challenging oppo-
nents. On a personal note, 
Quiros felt that she could get 
into the box and ?nish head-
ers from crosses as well as use 
her ability to get into posi-
tions where she could use her 
long shot capabilities. Quiros 
feels that for the upcoming 
season, one of the things that 
could help the team advance 
even further is developing 
the same chemistry with the 
incoming ?rst-years as they 
did this season. Quiros also 
feels that the team needs to 
focus on winning games that 
they dominate throughout 
the 90 minutes and avoiding

NISHANT RENIWAL

As the English Premier 
League season draws to a 
close, there’s not much left 
for the top teams to play for. 
Chelsea is out of the Champi-
ons League, out of the FA Cup, 
has already won the Capitol 
One Cup (or League Cup) and 
leads the table comfortably 
right now. However, the race 
to ?nish in the top four of the 
league and qualify for next 
year’s Champions League is 
still very much on and there 
are several clubs still involved 
in it. Let’s look at the form and 
?xtures for each of these clubs 
and predict how this race will 
?nish.
Arsenal
For a change, Arsenal is 
not the club on the outside 
looking in, waiting to pounce 
on the mistakes of others. 
Instead, they are currently 
the form team of the league 
and have won their last eight 
games on the trot, including 
last week’s impressive 4–1 
rout of fellow challengers Liv-
erpool. They sit pretty in sec-
ond with a lot of momentum 
behind them and an outside 
chance of catching Chelsea for 
the title too. With ten points 
separating them and ?fth-
placed Southampton, they are 
in a rather comfortable posi-
tion now, and should not have 
any trouble ?nishing second 
or even third. Lose both the 
crucial games against Chelsea 
at the Emirates and Manches-
ter United at Old Trafford, 
though, and it could become a 
dog?ght to ?nish fourth.
Prediction: Second. De-
spite history suggesting other-
wise, on current form it’s hard 
to bet against Arsenal against 
both Chelsea and United.
Manchester United
Manchester United’s en-
tire season prior to the game 
against Tottenham Hotspurs 
in March could have been 
summed up in one phrase — 
decent results, dour play. Lou-
is van Gaal was brought to the 
club not only to get the results 
but also to improve the style 
of play which had become un-
bearable to watch under David 
Moyes. For the most part, van 
Gaal got the results right, but 
there were too many games 
when it seemed as if United 
was simply laboring through 
games for wins or just bene?t-
ing from the poor form of their 
rivals. The game against Spurs 
changed that, though; United 
displayed a swashbuckling 
style to their game not seen be-
fore this season. That impres-
sive form continued into their 
crucial next game against Liv-
erpool, in which United beat 
their arch-rivals at An?eld and 
showed off some of their most 
exhilarating football. With six 
points separating them and 
Southampton now, United 
are far from comfortable in 
third. Their inconsistency has 
hampered them before but as 
winners of ?ve straight they 
are in a good position to ?n-
ish amongst the Champions 
League places.
Prediction: Third. They 
have three tough games: Man 
City, Chelsea, and Arsenal. If 
they win all three, they’re in 
pole position for second and 
could even be in with a chance 
of the title. They haven’t been 
consistent enough all season, 
however, for anything to sug-
gest they will win the afore-
mentioned games.
Manchester City
Coming into the new year, 
City had brie?y cut the gap 
at the top of the table and 
looked in prime position to 
improve their form and take 
the title away from the lead-
ers, exactly like last season. 
However, 2015 has not been 
kind to the blue half of Man-
chester, as they have lost four 
times and drawn thrice since 
the turn of the year. This in 
addition to the knockouts 
from the FA Cup (by lowly 
Middlesborough) and the 
Champions League (by Bar-
celona) means they have had 
a miserable 3 months and are 
showing no signs of stopping

MARCH 25, 1915
The Plebe Quali?cation 
Day exercises of March 19 
mark the establishment of a 
custom which is new, purely 
original, and precisely sym-
bolic of the institute’s motto, 
“My heart is in the work,” 
and, upon the other hand, 
one which attests to the spirit 
of the Design and Science 
Schools, be they considered 
as a scholastic division or as a 
unity in the adamantine bond 
of “Tech” brotherhood. 
This ceremony, although 
in an embryonic state, was 
presented in a manner which 
was indeed laudable to the 
partakers and class of?cers; 
and which, with the correc-
tion of each succeeding year 
will eventually emerge into a 
custom which will be known 
as a truly “Tech” conception 
and one which will be named 
as the ?rst of the Institute’s 
ceremonies, serving to engen-
der a ?rmer and purer class 
union. 
The purpose of this exer-
cise is to establish a de?nite 
date and method for the dis-
posal of the wearing of the 
regulation Plebe hat and tie. 
After this date and ceremony 
the ?rst-year men are no lon-
ger bound by the regulation 
Plebe rules, and at such a time 
they come into a full member-
ship of their class, unchecked 
by any traditional bands.
Friday morning the “cas-
ket” was placed in the central 
corridor of the Design School 
and presented a scene which, 
had it not been for the gay 
Tartan Plaid which draped the 
“casket” and the joyful song 
and spirit of the Plebe class, 
might have impressed the un-
knowing passer-by as a last 
honor reverently bestowed 
upon a great personage. 
Here the casket rested all 
day, supported upon richly 
draped standards, bearing all 
the earmarks of a state occa-
sion. 
At either end of the bier 
two candelabrums bore burn-
ing candles, while groups of 
“mourners’” gathered about 
the bier singing Dirge’s “It’s a 
Long Way to Tipperary,” “Slav 
War Songs” and a great variety 
of more appropriate and effec-
tive love songs. It was a day 
long to be fresh in the memory 
of the students.
The exercises began at 3:30 
p.m. on Friday afternoon, be-
ing brie?y as follows: 
The line of march lead 
from the Science to the Design 
School, being headed by the 
“Tech” band, which is always 
equal to every occasion.
 Immediately following the 
band marched the six “pall-
bearers” lead by E. H. Beck-
man of the sophomore class 
of the Design School and T. E. 
Orr of the senior class of the 
Science School. 
The “pallbearers” bore the 
“casket” gayly decorated with 
the Plaid “Tartan” colors over 
the top of which was placed a 
wreath and the Sophomore to-
ken which was later presented 
to the Freshman class. 
Next in line were the se-
niors, juniors, sophomores 
and last but by no means least 
on that occasion, the high-
spirited “Plebes.”
The line of march lead to 
the athletic ?eld where the 
ceremony took place in front 
of the grandstand. The ?rst 
step in the procedure of the 
verbal part of the ceremony 
was given by Mr. T. E. Orr, A. 
S. ’17, who delivered the fol-
lowing address of acceptance 
to the Plebe class as a body:
Mr. Orr’s Remarks
“Fellow members of the 
Design and Science Schools of 
Carnegie:
The importance of this oc-
casion in the life of the schools 
cannot be exaggerated. We 
have assembled here today to 
inaugurate a custom which we 
trust will endure throughout 
the life of Tech. 
As we look into the future 
we can see the students who 
are to follow us assembling 
each year for the repetition of 
this rite which marks the for-
mal acceptance of the entering 
class to the duties and privi-
leges of student brotherhood. 
We should consider our-
selves fortunate in being pres-
ent at this initial exercise. This 
custom which we inaugurate 
today will have a two-fold ef-
fect, not only will it bind these 
two schools together into a 
more complete unity, but it 
will promote a new spirit of 
fellowship among us all.
Nearly six months ago to-
day there entered here the 
men of the class of 1918. They 
came from many states, each 
with a different conception 
of student life, but they had 
a common goal: a technical 
training. 
We recognized your fail-
ings—particularly did we feel 
how far short you fall from 
the class that had immedi-
ately preceded you — but we 
accepted you on trial with 
the hope that contact with us 
might make you worthy of fol-
lowing in our footsteps. 
During those six months, 
following the same tasks, 
engaged in hard work com-
mon to all, through our guid-
ance that class has become 
cemented into a ?rm body, 
whose feelings and sentiments 
re?ect to some degree the true 
spirit of the combined schools, 
that indomitable spirit which 
has made Carnegie Tech and 
Carnegie men known, appre-
ciated and feared by all com-
petitors. 
Now the period of trial is 
over. There remains only this 
?nal but necessary rite to ex-
press our formal acceptance 
and welcome into the bond of 
Carnegie Tech. For the future 
our interests are one. In all 
that promotes the interests of 
Carnegie we count upon your 
loyal support.
With this honor, for it is an 
honor, comes responsibilities. 
What these responsibilities are 
we shall not go into detail — 
but they can all be summed up 
in the words — Be men, hon-
orable men, and in all things 
uphold the honor of Tech.
You men of 1918 have 
been tried by the test, by the 
thorough test of the past six 
months. You have shown the 
true spirit. 
On behalf of the Sopho-
more class I accept and wel-
come you into the fellowship 
of Carnegie men, and in token 
thereof do clothe you with the 
Tartan, the of?cial colors of 
your future Alma Mater.”
Mr. Orr’s remarks were 
very apt and were permeated 
with the true “Tech” spirit.
Second in order was the 
Plebe acceptance, which was 
given by Mr. James L. Payne, 
who is president of the Plebe 
Design students. 
Mr. Payne presented his re-
marks in a masterly manner. 
They were concise, vigorous, 
well-balanced and were given 
with emotion and dramatic 
force.
Mr. Payne’s Remarks
“In being chosen to repre-
sent the Plebe classes of both 
the schools of Applied Science 
and Design, I feel I have had 
imposed upon me today a re-
sponsibility too great for one 
man to attempt.
On this day we become full-
?edged citizens of Carnegie 
Tech, and, although only sev-
en months have passed since 
we began our careers here as 
a class, truly and purely in the 
embryonic stage of college 
life, we have already learned 
the value and meaning of real 
citizenship in this grand insti-
tution and we have looked for-
ward eagerly to the time when 
this privilege is bestowed 
upon us. (We are proud of this 
privilege.)
In September, 1914, we 
entered Carnegie Tech as in-
dividual men, — no unity — 
nothing to bind us together 
save a general sympathy for 
each other in bearing the 
brunt of all that goes to the 
traditional Plebe. 
Today we stand a uni?ed 
body, — organized — ready 
and willing to do our part in 
carrying on the work and pro-
moting the welfare and inter-
ests of old Tech. 
I speak as a Plebe and for 
the Plebes when I say we deem 
this a glorious privilege, for 
even now we have learned to 
love the place and stand ready 
to a man to earnestly and dili-
gently strive to put forth the 
best that is in us in doing our 
part.
Gladly do we accept this 
fellowship and we realize to 
the fullest extent the obliga-
tions and responsibility placed 
upon every man of the Plebe 
classes in taking all that this 
means as his own. 
Unfortunately, as classes, 
we are separate and distinct, 
but I voice the sentiments of 
every man I represent today in 
saying: 
First of all, we are men of 
Carnegie Tech — not students 
in the School of Applied De-
sign, — not members of the 
Science school — but a band 
of Carnegie men with our 
highest aim and ambition to 
so conduct ourselves ourselves 
that may worthily uphold all 
the wealth of sentiment and 
tradition woven into this Tar-
tan band.
Though still Plebes, we are 
today to burn the emblems 
of our class, — not as some 
would have them, badges of 
inferiority, but emblems typi-
fying the period of our prepa-
ration to become worthy citi-
zens of Carnegie Tech. 
We shall always cherish 
tender memories of this pe-
riod and its culmination in this 
day. As representative of the 
Plebe classes I would have you 
all know that our one motto 
shall always be — First and 
last — Carnegie Tech.

After long wait, dormitories built
APRIL 8, 1915
To him who knows how to 
wait, at last it has come! For 
those of us who, tempera-
mentally impulsive, do not 
know how to wait, probably 
because we realize so little 
the dif?culties inherent to 
the doing of large things, the 
dormitory question seemed 
destined never to become a 
reality. No one realizes the 
painstaking efforts, the un-
believable patience, the deli-
cacy of skill which have been 
necessary to make the dormi-
tories at the Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology a fact.
When the history of the 
work done by Director Ham-
erschlag in building up the 
schools is ?nally written, the 
dormitory question will as-
sume its right magnitude 
and will occupy a prepon-
derant part in the list of his 
achievements.
In keeping with the char-
acter of the school, the dor-
mitories will be substantial, 
comfortable, hygienic, and 
democratic. 
There will be no rich man 
or poor man unit; it will be 
an establishment in which 
the best spirit of Tech will 
be given and opportunity to 
reach its fullest expression, 
along the lines for which it 
has so far been known, name-
ly clean living, hard work and 
unrivaled good fellowship.
For the present the build-
ings will consist of two units, 
each accommodating about 
one hundred students in sin-
gle and double rooms, steam 
heated, electrically lighted, 
with proper regard for area 
and ventilation and adequate 
toilet and bathing facilities. 
The furniture will be both 
decorative and substantial, 
and will meet the require-
ments expected.
When one realizes that the 
erection of the dormitories is 
absolutely a business venture 
and that in spite of the cost of 
land and building material in 
this district, the student will 
get larger rooms, better ac-
commodations in a modern 
new building on Woodlawn 
Avenue within three hun-
dred yards of the campus, at a 
price not greater than the one 
he now pays, the merits of the 
proposition are obvious.
The single rooms, fur-
nished, will rent for about 
$100 per school year, the 
double rooms (corner) $150 
— all other double rooms 
for $140. The prices include 
heat, light, service and bed-
ding except blankets. 
Although a faculty proctor 
will reside in each unit, the 
student, in keeping with the 
democratic idea, will govern 
himself, the school authori-
ties trusting that his sense of 
proportion will ever enable 
him to differentiate between 
freedom and license.
It is expected that at the 
beginning of the next school 
year, the two units will be 
completed, and unless we 
read the signs badly, will be 
?lled before the ?rst class is 
called in session.
APRIL 29, 1915
Is this, the most terrible, 
most destructive and most 
uncalled for of wars, to be 
the last between civilized na-
tions? It certainly should be, 
and can easily be made so, 
and the world thus cleared of 
its greatest crime.
 Arbitration tribunals have 
already pronounced righteous 
judgment in no less than six 
hundred and twenty-seven 
cases, and not one has been 
challenged. Four of the na-
tions now engaged in war 
have resorted to arbitration 
before the Hague Tribunal for 
settlement of their disputes: 
France six times, Britain ?ve, 
Germany three, Russia two, 
and the United States three 
times. 
One of these disputes in-
volved no less than twelve, 
another six nations, and the 
verdicts of the Tribunal were 
accepted without demur! 
When such peaceful settle-
ment of international disputes 
is already within reach, why 
should not the nations named, 
inviting others to co-operate, 
agree that future differences 
shall be settled peacefully as 
these were? 
They could go a step fur-
ther, if necessary, and resolve 
that nations refusing to accept 
such peaceful settlement shall 
resort to war at their peril, 
since Arbitration had become 
the guardian angel of World 
Peace!
The ?ve nations named, 
Britain, France, Germany, 
Russia and the United States, 
or substitutes for any of the 
?ve which may decline to 
act, have only to agree that 
disputes arising between any 
of the nations shall be thus ar-
bitrated and, behold, blessed 
peace ascends the throne; 
men cease to act like savage 
beasts, killing each other, 
and we have before us — War 
abolished, Peace enthroned.
We have a World Supreme 
Court in the Hague Tribunal, 
which has been in success-
ful operation for 15 years. It 
was summoned by the pres-
ent Russian Czar, to whom 
the world owes an unpayable 
debt. He desired the pow-
ers “to devise, if possible, a 
means to put an end to the 
incessant armaments, and to 
seek a means of warding off 
the calamities threatening 
the whole world.” 26 nations 
responded to this ?rst call; to 
his second call no less than 44 
attended. 
May it be his privilege soon 
to call the third Congress and 
thus, perhaps, perform the 
greatest service ever permit-
ted to man.
Surely, after an armi-
stice is established between 
the nations now unfortu-
nately at war, the majority 
of en lightened people in all 
civilized lands will realize 
that permanent world peace 
would be Earth’s greatest 
bless ing and is entirely prac-
ticable through a union of a 
very few powerful na tions 
pledged to maintain it, and in-
viting all other civilized lands 
to be come members thereof, 
each nation contributing to 
the cost of such union in pro-
portion to its population and 
wealth. 
As nations accepted peace-
ful arbitration, armies and na-
vies would rapidly fade away 
because no longer necessary, 
and the prophecy would soon 
be ful?lled that “men shall 
learn war no more.” 
The Brotherhood of Man 
would then have arrived, and 
life on this Earth ?ash forth 
glimpses of Heaven.
Meanwhile let us pity 
and forgive those who urge 
increased armaments, for 
“they know not what they 
do.” “Preparation for war” by 
one nation invariably leads to 
“preparation against war” by 
the nations alarmed or endan-
gered, and armies and navies 
?nd no limit to their expan-
sion — as has been amply 
proven. 
“For what can war but end-
less war still breed?” asked 
Milton, poet and prophet, 
three centuries ago, and to 
this no answer has ever been 
or can be given! Let our motto, 
therefore, be “Preparation for 
World Peace,” strong in the 
faith that under this holy ban-
ner there can be no such word 
as fail.

What is so wrong with 
Tech that it cannot obtain 
a name performer like Ray 
Charles, The Smothers Broth-
ers, or the Chad Mitchell Trio 
for our big campus weekends? 
Why, when we are ?nancially 
and academically compared 
to the University of Pennsylva-
nia, Harvard University, and 
the Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology (MIT) do we 
fall short on big weekends? 
Why is our entertainment, 
the focus point of any college 
weekend, no more than a 
compromise?
The administration is 
deeply concerned with the 
apathy on campus, particu-
larly in the men’s dorms. Why 
is nothing being done, then, 
by the administration to en-
courage and increase partici-
pation and interest in school 
activities? 
The administration sup-
ports our athletic teams and 
these teams include only a 
limited number of students. 
The Administration cannot, 
then, be expected to support 
big weekends, an endeavor in-
volving a potentially huge per-
centage of the student body. 
Must we be forced to accept 
this logic?
Every big weekend is an 
attempt to work within a tra-
ditional structure with tra-
ditional ?nancial constants. 
That year close to $3,000 was 
delegated for Big Weekend 
Entertainment per semester. 
Five years and many tuition 
raises later, we are still work-
ing within an out-date $3,000 
budget. 
We propose, then, that an 
Activities Fee of $3 be paid 
each semester by each student 
at registration to total $9,000 
budget for the weekend en-
tertainment. The money 
could also be used to ?nance 
dances in the dorms, open the 
fraternity houses to the cam-
pus, and create for the ?rst 
time an All-Campus weekend. 
A student I.D. card would act 
as the ticket of admission to 
Friday night concerts, and 
weekend dances and parties. 
The Activities Fee could be 
broadened to cover other ar-
eas of campus activity, and ac-
tually become a cultural tick-
et. We could afford to bring 
in outstanding speakers and 
artists during the year, in ad-
dition to the bene?ts derived 
on Big Weekends.
Unfortunately we have to 
be realistic. The administra-
tion could not act on this im-
mediately, in fact, it would 
probably take a few years be-
fore the administration could 
get through the red-tape 
“necessary” to discuss this 
proposal.
Already, Peter, Paul and 
Mary; Bob Dylan; the Lime-
lighters; and The New Christy 
Minstrels are booked at other 
colleges. However, if acted 
upon immediately, our Friday 
night concert would consist 
of either Ray Charles, Chad 
Mitchell Trio, or the Smothers 
Brothers. Friday afternoon, in 
addition to the other events 
we could afford a block party 
with either Bo Diddley, Hank 
Ballard and the Midnight-
ers or The Coasters and their 
band. 
Saturday evening we 
would have two top-named 
local bands with valuable 
door prizes. This weekend 
would cost $10 per couple.
We are only able to do 
this with your support. If we 
are not able to increase our 
budget, the entertainment 
for Spring Carnival will con-
sist of the Journeymen or the 
Highwaymen.
Let’s break conserva-
tive tradition and support a 
Spring Carnival worthy of 
Tech’s reputation. Stand be-
hind something that would 
deny for once our pathetic 
complacency. 
Carnegie Tech should be able to attract better performers for events, say students

Proposed changes in Carn-
egie Tech women’s housing 
regulation will be presented 
for President Stever’s con-
sideration by the Division of 
Student Affairs in the next few 
weeks.
The major proposal re-
quests that “all senior girls 
and girls 21 and over should 
have the choice of either liv-
ing in the dormitory or secur-
ing accommodations outside 
of the dormitory with paren-
tal approval.”
According to George K. 
Brown, Dean of Student Af-
fairs, such a proposal had 
been “in the minds of the Stu-
dent Affairs Division for 2 or 3 
years.”
Late this fall, the division 
decided to make a survey 
of housing policy and fa-
cilities in other comparable 
universities.
While information was be-
ing obtained from the other 
institutions, Dean Milligan 
presented the housing propos-
al before Women’s Dormitory 
Council. To determine the re-
action of Morewood residents 
to the proposal Dorm Council 
distributed a questionnaire in 
December.
All but about 1 percent of 
the students responses were 
in favor of the proposal as 
stated.
Of those of the class of 
1966, more than 85 percent of 
the class of the 127 involved 
are de?nitely considering this 
move for next year. More than 
90 percent of these students 
receive parental approval.
The percentage of under-
classmen who are assured of 
parental approval for their se-
nior year is above 85 percent.
Almost 90 percent of the 
girls would be living with oth-
er girls and near campus.
According to Dorm Coun-
cil’s formal reply to Dean 
Brown, “All respondees felt 
that this proposal would be 
highly bene?cial to them as 
mature and responsible indi-
viduals.”
After reviewing these re-
sults of the Dorm Council’s 
survey and recognizing a 
trend toward the liberalizing 
of women’s housing regula-
tions in other institutions, the 
Division of Student Affairs 
suggested a further proposal. 
This proposal states that a 
section of Morewood Gar-
dens, preferably a tower, be 
set aside as an honor dormi-
tory. Though “very much in 
the thought stage,” plans for 
such housing facilities would 
include a self-rule system 
and no curfews. Residents 
would be selected on the ba-
sis of class, age, and academic 
record.
If accepted by Dr. Stever, 
both proposals might go into 
effect next September. It is 
expected that Dr. Stever’s de-
cisions will be known before 
May 1965 room selections.

Fly-catching is Carnegie 
Tech’s newest athletic pursuit.
Armed with bottles, 
screens, boxes, and nets, the 
biology students of M-19 
have spent several days at the 
garbage dumps of Skibo and 
Morewood. They are collect-
ing ?ies for laboratory experi-
mentation.
They’ve discovered that 
?y-catching requires great 
dexterity, keen eye-sight, and 
rapid eye-hand coordination. 
Maneuverability between the 
pails is also important.
Some use the “temptation” 
method of ?y-catching. They 
?ll the jars with jam and liver 
and leave them at the garbage 
dump overnight. Others at-
tempt to capture an alighting 
?y with up and carpboard 
methods.
The best method, however, 
appears to be the “open-?st-
ed” approach. According to 
students, one ?y-catcher has 
captures six ?ies a session us-
ing this method.
A descriptive source re-
ports that “my arm hangs 
limp; then I suddenly reach 
up and grab.”
The biology students sup-
ply appropriate homes for 
their ?y prisoners. Many 
use jars and gallon jugs with 
cheesecloth roo?ng.
Others have converted 
boxes into screened ?y rooms; 
some have built airy-screened 
cages.
One student applied car-
pentry techniques and built 
a ply-wood house with two 
doorways and interior shelv-
ing. These homes and their 
occupants are kept in the 
MMCC biology laboratory.
Students complain that ?y-
catching is dif?cult but that 
transferral of ?ies from their 
temporary to their permanent 
quarters is even more trying.
There may be many cap-
tive ?ies in the biology lab, 
the students report, but here 
are many more that didn’t 
quite make it.

The Division of Student Affairs presented changes in the university’s housing regulations for women over 21 
years of age. The proposed regulation would allow females to live in off-campus instead of only on-campus 
housing — but only if they had their parents’ approval.The proposal had been in the works for two to three 
years, but was ?nally announced in 1965, awaiting approval by University President Stever, pictured above.

130 students from the 
University of Pittsburgh, Cha-
tham College, Duquesne Uni-
versity, and Carnegie Tech 
participated in the civil rights 
demonstrations in Montgom-
ery, Alabama last week.
The students, accompa-
nied by religious leaders, in-
cluding Rabbi Richard Ruben-
stein, left from Pitt in three 
buses, on Sunday, March 14. 
In Montgomery, they were 
hosted by religious groups. 
Most students slept on coats, 
blankets, and sleeping bags 
in the Jackson Street Baptist 
Church.
On Monday night, about 
40 students took part in a 
demonstration in Montgom-
ery. There were no incidents 
on Monday, although many 
white citizens jeered the stu-
dents.
At Tuesday’s demonstra-
tions, horsemen appeared in 
front of the demonstrators. 
Miss Ronna Siegel, a Pitt stu-
dent injured on Tuesday, re-
ported, “When the horsemen 
appeared, our leaders told us 
to link arms, to sing ‘We Shall 
Overcome,’ and to walk slowly 
back to the Baptist Church.”
According to Miss Siegel, 
the horsemen attempted to 
separate the group. One part 
of the group was able to run, 
but the other was “cornered.” 
The students were pushed 
against walls and porches. 
Miss Siegel said that the 
horsemen used whips, rope, 
and canes to disperse the 
crowd.
Many students explained 
that they felt it their duty to 
participate. Said Miss Sie-
gel, “I went because I had to. 
I wanted to show how I felt 
about the atrocities commit-
ted in Selma, to protest, and 
also to see for myself if all re-
ports were true.”
Howard Shuch, Carnegie 
Tech ?rst-year, said, “I feel I 
have a responsibility to my fel-
low man: to allow him to walk 
in dignity where I am allowed 
to do so; to help him to speak 
freely in the hope that he may 
be heard, to help him assert his 
independence and his status of 
human being equal to myself.”
Shuch has had much ex-
perience in the ?eld of civil 
rights. He feels that “It is a 
matter of conscience, a moral 
obligation. Anyone who does 
not feel this obligation should 
not be in the movement.”
Erwin R. Steinberg, dean 
of Margaret Morrison College, 
commented, “I was concerned 
about the possibility that stu-
dents might be hurt, but was 
pleased to see that Carnegie 
Tech students are not only 
aware of today’s problems, 
but are committed enough to 
take personal risks in showing 
where they stand.”

NOVEMBER 21, 1989
James B. Endres
After receiving word of 
large, as-yet anonymous in-
tended donations to the capital 
campaign, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Board of Trustees committed 
the University to the razing of 
Skibo and the construction of 
a new, $41-million University 
Center.
The move places the Uni-
versity Center project as the 
“top priority” of the Universi-
ty’s fundraising effort, accord-
ing to the Vice President for 
Development David Maloney.
“It was voted that the 
Board of Trustees be commit-
ted to support fundraising for 
the University Center and that 
this project be a priority of the 
capital campaign,” states the 
Trustee resolution. “It was fur-
ther voted that this project be 
totally supported by fundrais-
ing proceeds.”
The project entails a new 
campus activities center build-
ing that will replace Skibo and 
develop the surrounding area.
“We are launched on a 
campaign to plan and build 
the University Center from 
proceeds of our fundraising 
campaign,” said President 
Richard Cyert.
Based on the three lead 
gifts, Cyert estimates that the 
ground will be broken for the 
new center in at most three 
years — “sooner if we can 
raise the money sooner.” He 
speculated that the remaining 
money needed, which he de-
scribed as “a little more than 
half,” would be raised by that 
time.
Cyert indicated that he 
couldn’t foresee raising the 
money in less than two years, 
however. Maloney, who heads 
the fundraising campaign, 
agreed with Cyert’s estimates.
“The intended gift is very 
signi?cant, and it enables us to 
move forward with great en-
thusiasm,” Maloney said. He 
declined to be speci?c in terms 
of an actual dollar amount 
“until that person is willing 
to say ‘go ahead and publicize 
this.’ ”
The new center may be 
named after the lead donor or 
his family; however, no deci-
sions have been made. “I be-
lieve that for a person who is 
seriously interested in making 
a gift to the University Center,” 
said Maloney, “part of the rea-
son that they’re saying ‘I’d pre-
fer if there was no publicity’ is 
because these particular ar-
rangements have not been set. 
I think that’s what’s running 
through that person’s mind.”
“We are urging him to 
name it after his family or him-
self,” said Cyert.
“The gift will be in cash and 
cash-type securities, so that 
it’s not going to be a bequest, 
or left in his will so we get it af-
ter he dies or anything of that 
kind. He is anxious to give his 
money to us as rapidly as pos-
sible,” Cyert said.
“I sense in this a real en-
thusiasm,” said Cyert. “It’s the 
most enthusiastic I’ve seen 
Trustees. Everyone is con-
vinced that this is necessary.”
“We don’t think that just 
having a facility is the an-
swer to all of the student-life 
problems,” Cyert said.
“We think facilities can 
help things, but we intend to 
continue with a vigorous stu-
dent affairs program that re-
ally tries to meet the needs of 
students. We got the Center 
as an important ingredient in 
improving the quality of life on 
campus,” he said.
Indeed, many adminis-
trators have expressed their 
hopes of improved quality of 
student life on the Center. “I 
want to see a lot more student-
faculty interaction,” said Cy-
ert. “We think this center can 
facilitate that interaction.”
“In the terms of quality of 
life, the key is the interaction 
between students and faculty 
in my view,” said Cyert. “We 
just need more of that.”
Cyert maintains that the 
two- to three-year timetable 
for the center is realistic. 
“I know there have been 
these ideas that someone said 
that there was going to be a 
center in some quick period of 
time. I have always tried to be 
very honest and conservative 
about it. 
“I was dragging my feet the 
whole concept until I really felt 
we had a good shot at raising 
the money and going ahead, 
and that I was convinced we 
should do it. I don’t want to 
promise anything before we 
can deliver it,” Cyert said.
Cyert and Keating agree 
that the $41 million estimate 
is realistic. “We’ve got every-
thing in this estimate — in-
cluding the kitchen sink,” said 
Cyert.
Keating expects student 
involvement in the planning 
stages of the Center. 
“As we move ahead with 
the design, we’ll have exten-
sive student input, [as well as 
input] from various organiza-
tions and groups, faculty, and 
various administrative and 
staff groups. These people are 
all going to have to help us de-
sign the building.
“We’re going to need to 
know how to organize these 
spaces, how they should be 
con?gured, and what works 
and what doesn’t work. 
There’s going to be extensive 
input from people who will 
use the building,” Keating 
said.
A major question yet to be 
resolved is the accommoda-
tion of organizations now 
occupying Skibo during the 
building of the new Center. 
“We’ve been doing a lot of 
thinking about that. I don’t 
think we’ve got the whole an-
swer to that,” said Cyert.
“We certainly don’t have 
the whole answer to that,” 
said Keating. “The biggest step 
of course is going to be the 
dining hall in the new dorm. 
That’s been done and accom-
plished.”
“The navy building hap-
pens to be absolutely perfect,” 
said Keating. “It may become 
available at the right time; it 
has the right number of spac-
es. But we don’t yet have it. 
it’s clearly high on the list,” he 
said.
Cyert indicated that the 
University is still exploring 
possibilities for interim ac-
commodations. “There just is 
nothing de?nite,” he said.

When most people think 
about Spring Carnival, images 
of the booths, the bands, the 
buggy races, and the Scotch 
‘n’ Soda production come to 
mind. Is there more to Carni-
val? Yes! Carnival is ?lled with 
enough activities to occupy 
every moment of the weekend 
extravaganza.
What carnival would be 
worth of the name if not for 
its rides? The same rides from 
last year will be offered again 
this year by J&J Amusements.
Tickets will be available for 
pre-sale at the Skibo Info Desk 
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. until 
Wednesday. On Thursday, ad-
vance tickets will be available 
from 9 a.m. to noon.
After that, they will be sold 
at the price of 30¢ each near 
the rides on Midway, which is 
located on the Skibo parking 
lot. Tickets for the children’s 
rides will be on sale in the 
Warner Hall parking lot. Tick-
et sellers are still needed. If 
you are interested, call Rides 
Chair Frank DiVito at x2119.
The rides will be started 
after the opening ceremonies. 
This year, the opening cer-
emonies feature four compan-
ions of Dave Lamont who will 
dive out of an airplane from 
4000 feet in the air. 
Dave Lamont is an adjunct 
professor in the Graduate 
School of Industrial Adminis-
tration and is also a skydiver, 
but could not jump due to 
technicalities. The four dives 
will land at 5 p.m. on the Cut 
between Warner Hall and the 
Skibo parking lot. Lamont will 
be on the ground setting up 
the landing sites and will talk 
about what the divers will be 
doing.
A returning attraction will 
be the laser show. Last year 
the gym was packed with peo-
ple watching the show. This 
is the second year that the 
laser show will be be showing 
and this year, if the weather 
permits, it will be shown out-
doors on the Mall at 9:30 p.m. 
on Friday. In the event of rain, 
the event will take place in the 
gym.
If the weather continues to 
be good on Saturday, hot air 
balloon rides will be offered 
from 2 p.m. to 5 p.m. The bal-
loon rides are paid for by the 
student activities fee. The bal-
loon will go up by Warner Hall 
to a height of 75 feet, giving 
each rider a birds-eye view of 
the campus.
Two charity events will be 
held over Spring Carnival to 
bene?t the Children’s Hospital 
of Pittsburgh. The ?rst one is 
the Charity Eat-a-Thon, orga-
nized by Delta Delta Delta and 
Navy ROTC. 
Teams and individuals will 
compete for cash and various 
other prizes donated by local 
businesses. The object is to eat 
Jell-O in the shortest amount 
of time. The second event 
with be Charitable Chairs, or-
ganized by co-ed service fra-
ternity Alpha Phi Omega. This 
will be the sixth year in which 
the giant musical chairs game 
is played at Carnival.
Student Environmen-
tal Action Coalition (SEAC) 
members will present a house 
made out of aluminum cans 
as part of Earth Day. Inside 
the structure will be displays 
about the environment. 
On Earth Day, the Sunday 
of Carnival, SEAC will take the 
fortress down to Point Park, 
Pittsburgh’s Earth Day center.
Two comedians, Michael 
Spiro and Henry Cho, will be 
performing during Carnival. 
Spiro is a folk singer who used 
to perform every year dur-
ing ?rst-year Orientation and 
Carnival. He is returning after 
a two year break.
Cho has been on various 
TV programs, but will be per-
forming at Carnegie Mellon 
for the ?rst time in the AB Cof-
feehouse. 
What makes him unique 
is the fact that he is an Asian 
comedian with a southern ac-
cent. Spiro will perform from 
2:30 to 4 p.m. on Friday and 
Cho will be performing at 8 
p.m. Saturday. Both comedi-
ans are performing in the Tent 
and the shows are free to the 
public.
Along with these activities 
are the regular weekend AB 
and SDC movies, a record-
ing booth, the annual Arts 
& Crafts Fair, an AB Swing 
Dance, an exhibition by the 
Carnegie Mellon Navy ROTC 
Drill Team, and the AB con-
cert featuring Oingo Boingo.
Spring Carnival promises fun, festivity to students of Carnegie Mellon 
JANUARY 30, 1990

Like so many people, Rob-
ert Shoun acquired a cellular 
phone in 1990. This came as 
a surprise to his friends be-
cause Shoun hates phones 
and never answered his calls 
in the past. There is no doubt 
that Bob is enjoying his new 
toy. I know this because he 
called me four times in one 
day.
“How is everything with 
you?” he wanted to know.
“That’s a stupid question, 
Bob. Why are you calling?”
“I got this new car phone 
and I have to ring somebody.”
“You never telephoned 
when I needed you,” I told 
him. “Now I hear from you all 
the time.”
Bob sounded defensive. 
“Can I help it if I prefer to call 
from my car? I just don’t like 
doing it from the of?ce.”
“If you have to talk to 
someone, why don’t you try 
calling your wife?”
“She isn’t taking my calls 
anymore. She took her tele-
phone off the hook two 
weeks ago.”
“Surely you have some 
business buddies you can get 
in touch with,” I said.
“I do,” he answered. “But 
most of them are putting me 
on hold. They ?gure anyone 
who calls from a car phone 
doesn’t have much to do. 
Give me a break — talk to me 
for the next three blocks.”
“I ran out of things to say 
after you went through a red 
light on K Street last week. 
Bob, you should have thought 
of how many people would 
answer you calls before you 
bought the telephone.”
“I did, but the ones I 
counted on let me down. You 
would think they’d be eager 
to converse with someone 
who was gridlocked in front 
of the White House.”
“They are, but sometimes 
our phone fades out on them, 
Bob, and that can be very an-
noying.”
“Who told you that my 
phone faded out?” Bob asked.
“Michael Kahme. He said 
that every time you ring him 
up, you pass a dead spot and 
he can’t hear a word you’re 
saying.”
“He’s just making it up. I 
am known to everyone be-
cause of the clarity of my 
calls.”
“Bob, I have to go. Joe 
Califan is calling me from his 
car and he gets nervous when 
I leave him hanging.”
“It’s okay with me. I’m go-
ing to be busy. I have to dial 
the weather service and then 
911 and after that the 800 
number to order cutrate Pa-
varotti records.”
“You’d be better off forget-
ting the phone and listening 
to your radio.”
“You don’t understand, 
a cellular phone has to be 
used. I keep looking at it and 
I know that there is someone 
out there waiting to hear 
from me. Maybe I’ll call infor-
mation in San Antonio.”
“Do you know anyone in 
San Antonio?”
“No, but it would be nice 
to ?nd out how many Shouns 
live in Texas.”
“Tell me, Bob. Have you 
ever made a call that couldn’t 
wait until you reached the of-
?ce?”
“I don’t think so, but I’ve 
made many to people who 
were terribly impressed when 
they found out that I was call-
ing from my car. Once you 
have a phone in your auto-
mobile, others respect you for 
who you really are.”
“That’s probably true. Can 
I go now?”
“Okay, but you better a 
take the car number if you get 
the urge to talk to me.”
“Why would I want to do 
that?”
“To thank me for using 
AT&T.”

On April 10, of?cials at 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness discovered that a hacker 
had broken into a number of 
computers in the school and 
possibly compromised the 
personal information of up to 
6000 people.
According to the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette article, 
information regarding grad-
uate students, alumni, fac-
ulty, and staff was the most 
vulnerable. Although un-
dergraduates were noti?ed 
of the problem on April 20, 
they have not, as of yet, been 
directly affected.
Roger Ma, a ?fth-year 
scholar and an undergradu-
ate in the Tepper School, 
said that the administration 
“sent something to the whole 
Tepper School of Business 
[saying that] that the com-
puters were compromised,” 
but that they did not believe 
undergraduates’ information 
had been affected. Overall, 
Ma does not believe that the 
breach is a major concern for 
undergraduates.
Among information sent 
out to students was an e-
mail from Milton L. Co?eld, 
the executive director of the 
business administration pro-
gram, and a noti?cation from 
Joel Smith, Vice Provost of 
Computing Services.
Smith’s e-mail states, 
“Much of the information 
compromised in these in-
cidents was not on servers 
but rather desktop or laptop 
computers. So, this is not a 
message exclusively to sys-
tem administrators. It is a 
message to everyone who 
uses a computer at Carnegie 
Mellon.”
According to Tepper’s di-
rector of public relations, Mi-
chael Laf?n, the incident was 
discovered some time around 
10 p.m. on April 10, although 
it was “dif?cult to pinpoint” 
the exact time. As for how 
many computers are compro-
mised, Laf?n said, “I know 
that at one point there was 
a preliminary number,” but 
that he was not sure. He be-
lieved that compromised per-
sonal information included 
applicant data such as Social 
Security numbers, contact 
information, grade-point av-
erages, and standardized test 
scores.
Laf?n also told the Post-
Gazette that the reason for 
the ten-day delay between 
the breach’s discovery and 
student noti?cation was so 
that the school could directly 
contact students and alumni 
who might have been af-
fected.
As of yet, there has been 
no reported evidence that 
anyone’s information has 
been misused. However, stu-
dents in the Tepper School 
of Business are encouraged 
to keep an eye out to make 
sure that their information is 
not being compromised. The 
Federal Trade Commission 
suggests watching for warn-
ing signs in the case of iden-
tity theft, such as unsolicited 
mail or calls from debtors or 
credit card companies with 
which students are not in-
volved.
Students should also 
check their credit card state-
ments every three months 
initially, and if they are con-
cerned they are victims of 
fraud, should close existing 
credit card or bank accounts.
This security breach is 
just one of several techno-
logical incidents that have 
affected college campuses 
recently. Roughly one month 
ago, the Tepper School be-
came a target when a web-
site error allowed applicants 
to the school to see their ac-
ceptance status. However, 
the Post-Gazette reports that 
Laf?n does not see a link be-
tween this incident and any 
previous ones.

It seems fair to consider to-
day’s American society to be 
part of the Modern Age. Sure, 
we don’t have ?ying cars yet, 
but I think the political, so-
ciological, and technological 
infrastructures here are more 
than suf?cient for us to consid-
er ourselves modern. In a simi-
lar fashion, I think that we are 
living in the modern era in the 
world of entertainment. Natu-
rally, artists and entertainers 
are still doing their best to 
?nd new and creative ways 
to stimulate the senses. Yet, 
the basic knowledge of what 
things tickle peoples’ fancies, 
as well as the technology used 
in making music, movies, etc., 
is pretty well established.
That having been said, I’ve 
noticed that we have a lot of 
completely useless forms of 
entertainment that were at 
one time popular but are at 
the moment surviving only to 
preserve tradition. Now don’t 
get me wrong — some tradi-
tional things are ?ne and well, 
but it’s silly to hang on to an 
art or entertainment form just 
because people liked it hun-
dreds of years ago. Instead, we 
should let go of the past and 
support the elimination of su-
per?uous media. Here are two 
of them.
The ?rst up on my list is a 
fairly easy target: the opera. 
I’d include ballet in this com-
plaint, but my sister dances 
ballet and hate mail from a 
close relative is much worse 
than the normal hate mail I 
get. Anyway, it is crystal clear 
that it is time to close the book 
on the opera game. Back in 
the 1800s, or whenever it 
?rst started (I don’t have a re-
search budget), I’m sure opera 
was top-notch. I bet they even 
had scalpers at all the top Eu-
ropean houses. Back then, all 
of the classic composers were 
at the top of their games (I’m 
making this up, but it seems 
reasonable. They must have 
had a heyday at some point, 
right?).
But, let’s face facts: it’s 
2005. We have PlayStation 2, 
where the controllers vibrate 
when your character gets hit. 
We’ve all seen Star Wars and 
The Matrix. There have been 
50 years of recorded rock 
music. With such modern 
electronic wonders available, 
it just isn’t possible that high-
pitched (very high-pitched) 
singing in a foreign language 
is reeling in a whole lot of 
youngsters these days. It’s un-
clear to me, personally, why it 
ever was in vogue, but that’s 
beside the point.
Furthermore, it seems very 
unlikely that many of the great 
young musical minds of today 
have opera on their minds. 
Thus, I propose that the opera 
community should just simply 
call it quits. No more perfor-
mances, no more composi-
tions, and most importantly, 
no pretentious monocle-wear-
ing people having to pretend 
that they ?nd it enjoyable. 
Hold a press conference and 
say, “Look, it was a good run, 
but we’ve realized that opera 
is outdated and it’s time for us 
to move on. Thanks for your 
support over the years. It’s 
been fun.”
Maybe opera could even 
hang on for a while longer in 
Italy or something like that, 
just to satisfy the tradition-
alists. Or maybe just have a 
museum that nobody visits. 
Either way, it’s time to stop 
acting like having a relatively 
unpopular thing like opera 
around gives us “culture,” ev-
eryone’s favorite code word 
for boring.
Sports, both televised 
and live, are major players in 
modern entertainment. The 
Big Four (football, basketball, 
baseball, hockey) are all over 
the network, and cable air-
waves’ football basically ap-
proaches the level of national 
religion when it’s in full swing. 
With those and a handful of 
other excellent niche sports, 
fans of athletic competition 
have more than enough to 
keep themselves busy. So, 
why on Earth is boxing still 
around? The early popular-
ity of boxing is not hard to 
understand: It was easier for 
old-time sportsmen to grasp 
the concept of beating their 
opponents senseless than to 
worry about full counts and 
?rst downs.
Plus, it was one of the 
?rst popular televised sports 
(along with pro wrestling) 
simply because it was easy to 
?lm. But now that we have 
our well-designed modern 
games and broadcasting tech-
niques, there’s really no need 
for prize?ghting to continue 
just because it used to be 
popular. The sport’s visibility 
has been waning pretty much 
since Rocky IV. I doubt anyone 
reading this can even name 
the heavyweight champion of 
the world at the moment (no, 
it isn’t Mike Tyson) despite 
the fact that there are roughly 
eight of them.
It’s clear that 21st century 
sports fans prefer the more 
re?ned violence of the grid-
iron, where although it is of-
ten advantageous to concuss 
your opponent, it’s not actu-
ally required to achieve vic-
tory. The solution to boxing’s 
fading hold on sports fans 
is clear: Simply get rid of it. 
Trust me, no one other than 
pay-per-view executives and 
casino owners are going to no-
tice. Get with the opera people 
and coordinate press confer-
ences if you like. The “sweet 
science,” as boxing is often 
bizarrely called, should just 
ride off into the sunset, and 
its participants’ brain cells will 
forever thank them.
The powers-that-be in 
the realms of opera and box-
ing, I’m asking you sincerely: 
Give it a rest. We have plenty 
of great entertainment op-
tions, thanks, and things will 
be much easier on us all if 
you stop trying to be relevant.
There are tons of other “clas-
sic” forms of entertainment 
that have had their moment 
in the sun and should think 
about retirement. 
I could have written this 
entire column about circuses. 
Plus, I’ve restricted myself 
to things popular in the rela-
tively untraditional U.S. Lord 
only knows what sort of out-
dated arts and entertainment 
is foisting itself on the rest of 
the world. I think that most 
unpopular forms of entertain-
ment will eventually go away 
out of public apathy, but I say 
that’s not soon enough.
Entertainment industry must adapt and change to ?t our needs
“The powers-that-be in the 
realms of opera and boxing, I’m 
asking you sincerely: Give it a 
rest. We have plenty of great 
entertainment options, thanks, 
and things will be much easier 
on us all if you stop trying to be 
relevant.”

Restaurant reviews are 
notoriously kind. But after 
spending months telling you 
where to eat in Pittsburgh, I 
want to let you know where 
you should not eat. Let me 
clarify, though: I only focused 
on restaurants that claim to 
be good and are not. At places 
like the ‘O’ and Ritter’s Diner, 
there are no claims that the 
food tastes good. The restau-
rants below are more like car-
nival rides; at ?rst, they seem 
appealing. But just because 
your friends are going doesn’t 
mean you’re just going to have 
less money in your pocket af-
terwards: You’ll also have an 
upset stomach.
India Garden
India Garden has, by far, 
the worst waiters in all of 
Pittsburgh. The service there 
is truly atrocious. Unlike other 
ethnic restaurants where the 
menu is enthusiastically ex-
plained, India Garden work-
ers just don’t care. I have 
dined there with a group of 
Indians who tried in vain to 
engage with the waiters in 
Hindi when asking about spe-
ci?c dishes. I have also been 
there with Americans who 
meekly asked the waiters the 
differences between one dish 
and another to no response. 
In fact, the waiters did not 
respond to either group and 
gave everyone the same rude 
treatment. At least they don’t 
discriminate.
The menu itself is charac-
teristic of low-end Indian res-
taurants, featuring the same 
standard dishes as Taste of 
India and Indian Oven. Most 
of their vegetable dishes are 
so overcooked that they have 
the consistency of mush. India 
Garden draws a large half-
priced food crowd since it was 
the only Indian food that was 
half-priced for a while. How-
ever, last week I discovered 
the newly opened restaurant, 
Bombay Palace, on nearby 
Semple Street. Not only is the 
food signi?cantly better than 
India Garden, but their half-
price starts at 9:30 pm.
Joe Mama’s
Joe Mama’s is a mediocre 
restaurant at best. I like to 
think of it as a crappier ver-
sion of the Olive Garden. It’s 
like they took something bad, 
and made it worse. If you want 
real Italian food, try Girasole 
in Shadyside. If you want half-
priced food, the pasta selec-
tions at Fuel and Fuddle are 
much better than those at Joe 
Mama’s. Experience has led 
me to believe that even a dish 
like spaghetti is better at Eat ‘n 
Park than at Joe Mama’s.
The Cheesecake Factory
The Cheesecake Factory is 
a horrible restaurant in ways 
too numerous to count. I can 
guarantee you that you will 
have to wait an unreasonably 
long time to be seated, regard-
less of when you go. Because 
the restaurant doesn’t take 
reservations, you have no 
choice but to wait for up to 
two hours to be seated.
The atmosphere inside is 
that of a giant eating ware-
house. There are no intimate 
tables and no secluded booths 
where you can enjoy a meal 
in peace. This is a restaurant 
dreamt up for suburban-
ites who like everything big, 
bland, and loud. In fact, most 
of the diners seemed to have 
?ocked to the Cheesecake Fac-
tory from out of town.
As for the food: Everything 
on the menu is good, but noth-
ing is spectacular. Further-
more, one entree can feed a 
family of four. No joke, I have 
been there with my family and 
the four of us ordered one ap-
petizer, one entrée, and one 
dessert. The noise level of the 
restaurant, with screaming 
kids and noisy families, makes 
you feel like you are back in a 
summer camp mess hall. Bet-
ter food can be had elsewhere 
in the South Side.
The Melting Pot
The Melting Pot in Station 
Square may initially seem 
appealing, as it is a fondue-
themed restaurant. Do not be 
tempted. On the night I dined 
there, the restaurant was 
?lled with people on dates 
who had never eaten there be-
fore: a dangerous sign. Upon 
being seated, I found the pric-
es to be astronomical for the 
type of food offered. To eat a 
full meal at the Melting Pot, 
be prepared to spend around 
$40–50 per person.
Furthermore, the wait staff 
is overly insistent. My waiter, 
a Pitt student, proceeded to 
talk to my table for 30 minutes 
about how he was getting into 
real estate investments. He 
then continued with his hard 
sell of the deluxe dinner pack-
age, around $65 per person, 
which we repeatedly declined. 
Upscale romantic restaurants 
in Pittsburgh are plentiful. 
The next time you are looking 
for a good date restaurant, try 
one of the South Side’s other 
establishments like Le Pom-
mier: a fraction of the price 
for exponentially better food.
Cozumel
I only go to Cozumel for 
drinks, but every time I go, I 
am shocked at the number of 
people actually eating there. 
Cozumel claims to serve au-
thentic Mexican food. I have 
to disagree. Refried beans 
that come out of a can and 
lots of cheese does not make 
food Mexican. Not only is the 
cost high and the portion size 
small, but the food looks and 
tastes like someone bought it 
cheap from Taco Bell and rear-
ranged it on a plate.

When an earthquake 
struck the island nation of 
Haiti nearly three weeks ago, 
the United States was quick 
to respond. Carnegie Mellon 
students were encouraged by 
faculty, student government, 
and the many service orga-
nizations on campus to send 
whatever help they could 
to the millions of affected 
Haitians. Carnegie Mellon’s 
Division of Student Affairs 
and student government 
organized and headed vari-
ous events to help the cause, 
while hundreds of students 
went to great lengths to show 
their support for Haiti relief.
Student Body President 
Rotimi Abimbola was re-
sponsible for organizing the 
groups and encouraging col-
laboration across organiza-
tions. Two days after the ?rst 
quake struck, nearly 20 cam-
pus groups met to discuss 
their options. “Everybody had 
[a] small idea of what they 
wanted to do,” said Abim-
bola. “Everyone wanted to do 
something.”
These small ideas grew at 
an unmatched pace. Over the 
past two weeks, hundreds of 
dollars were collected and 
sent to nonpro?t organiza-
tions like Doctors Without 
Borders and the Brother’s 
Brothers Foundation. Ser-
vices were held in the form of 
prayer groups and candlelit 
vigils to honor those who lost 
their lives and their loved 
ones. 
Students also tried to ad-
dress the serious medical 
issues facing Haiti in the af-
termath of the earthquake. 
Around campus, groups set 
up boxes that encouraged 
students to deposit hygienic 
items to send to the victims, 
including buckets, hairbrush-
es, toothpaste, and tooth-
brushes. Other divisions of 
Carnegie Mellon, including 
the Silicon Valley campus in 
California, pledged support.
“Haiti’s always been re-
ally unfortunate,” said ?rst-
year computer science major 
Sammy Jelin, who collected 
donations on behalf of Stu-
dent Life. “It’s good people 
are helping out.”
Besides funds, Carnegie 
Mellon has also been utilizing 
its technological expertise. 
The Language Technologies 
Institute has worked on an 
updated translation system 
using new translating tech-
nology to convert Creole, the 
language spoken by most of 
Haiti’s population, into other 
languages, including French, 
the language spoken by much 
of Haiti’s upper class. 
Once the translation data 
becomes available in a read-
able format, the Paris orga-
nization Translators Without 
Borders has promised to dis-
tribute it to relief workers in 
Haiti.
Bridging communication 
gaps is a crucial step in pro-
viding relief. Abimbola has 
seen ?rsthand the importance 
of translating in her experi-
ence with caring for orphans 
who moved from Haiti to 
Pittsburgh. She expressed her 
frustration at being unable to 
reassure these Haitian chil-
dren of their safety and well-
being, and that it “broke [her] 
heart.”
Carnegie Mellon has also 
considered the future of Haiti, 
and has taken several paths to 
contribute to the long-term 
recovery of the nation. 
Once the funds have been 
?nalized, they will be distrib-
uted to their respective char-
ity organizations as soon as 
possible. Carnegie Mellon has 
also not ruled out the pos-
sibility of taking on another 
project such as, Abimbola al-
luded, the reconstruction of 
a school and sending Carn-
egie Mellon students to Haiti 
as teachers. The School of 
Drama’s class of 2010 plans to 
dedicate their senior cabaret 
to Haiti and its reconstruc-
tion. An unnamed alumnus 
has pledged to match whatev-
er amount of money Carnegie 
Mellon raises, dollar for dol-
lar, with a donation of their 
own.
The relief effort has not 
been without controversy 
and con?ict. One of the orga-
nizations to which Carnegie 
Mellon has pledged funds, 
Haitian singer Wyclef Jean’s 
Yéle foundation, has been un-
der scrutiny for misdirecting 
funds. 
Such exploitation has left 
many feeling unwilling to 
donate without seeing the 
changes that their money will 
bring. 
Despite the long road to 
recovery ahead and the obsta-
cles presently facing students, 
Abimbola believes that the 
campus community remains 
dedicated to joining together. 
“Despite our roles as organi-
zation leaders and students 
on campus,” she said, “you 
can still do things to help.”

What attracts people 
to video games varies: For 
some it’s the competition, for 
some it’s about problem solv-
ing, and for others it’s just 
recreational. 
However, according to one 
Carnegie Mellon professor, 
life may one day resemble the 
games that so many enjoy, as 
more companies and busi-
nesses are making products 
that take advantage of popu-
lar elements of video games.
Jesse Schell is a professor 
of game design and teaches 
the popular Building Virtual 
Worlds course in the Enter-
tainment Technology Center. 
He also owns his own line of 
video games, Schell Games. 
He coined the term “Gamep-
ocalypse” in order to describe 
what he thinks is life’s resem-
blance to a video game. “We 
already see games creeping 
up into our everyday lives 
in all kinds of funny ways,” 
Schell noted in an interview 
with The Escapist magazine.
Schell cited several ex-
amples of Gamepocalypse in 
the same interview, including 
Starbucks using a point sys-
tem in order to provide its cus-
tomers with rewards such as 
coupons and price reductions. 
Schell credits new develop-
ments in tracking technology 
as a catalyst for Gamepoca-
lypse. Schell points at input 
technologies in games like 
Dance Dance Revolution and 
the Wii remote, which tracks 
the movement of the body 
and makes it a part of game-
play. Such input technology 
can also be seen in recent gad-
gets such as smartphones and 
GPS systems.
Schell also noted that 
camera technologies will 
be the next big step in input 
technology. The Internet and 
Wi-Fi will also contribute to 
Gamepocalypse growth in the 
coming years, Schell predicts. 
“Anything meaningful that 
you do in your life,” Schell 
said, “there are ways that 
you’ll want to hook it up to the 
Internet.” Indeed, with tech-
nologies like Nike+ shoes, 
which measure the number 
of steps taken while wearing 
them and can be connected to 
computers via USB, connec-
tivity is very much already a 
large part of life.
Much of this Internet ac-
cessibility is a wise market 
strategy on behalf of compa-
nies. Interconnectivity be-
tween companies is becoming 
common. For example, be-
coming a fan of Bing on Face-
book earns a user Farmville 
points. All of these industries 
bene?t from that one decision 
to earn points.
Gamepocalypse, however, 
has its downsides. On the one 
hand, it bene?ts individuals; 
according to Schell, “when 
people observe [changes that 
the games make that impact 
them], they change their be-
haviors for the better.”
On the other hand, some 
sectors, such as the tobacco 
industry and fast food, might 
take advantage of their own 
point incentives and poten-
tially endanger individuals’ 
health. The choices, Schell ad-
mitted, are becoming harder.

President Barack Obama 
came to Carnegie Mellon on 
June 2 as the most recent in 
a series of notable political 
visitors, including Michelle 
Obama, John McCain, and 
Chelsea Clinton. Announced 
only four days in advance, the 
purpose of the president’s visit 
was to give a speech that cen-
tered on the economy, energy, 
education, and innovation.
In his speech, Obama was 
quick to declare that the steps 
his administration has taken 
have “succeeded in breaking 
the freefall of the economy,” 
pointing to increasing jobs 
over the last ?ve months, re-
covered costs from supporting 
the automotive and ?nancial 
industries, and those com-
panies once again producing 
pro?t. 
However, with a recover-
ing yet “fragile” economy, 
Obama spent the majority of 
his speech discussing how we 
can invest in the future of the 
country.
He made several refer-
ences to improving America’s 
higher education system by 
making it more accessible to 
all students. 
“To achieve my goal of 
ensuring America once more 
has the highest proportion of 
college graduates in the world 
by 2020, we passed a law that 
will make college more af-
fordable by ending the unnec-
essary taxpayer subsidies that 
go to ?nancial institutions for 
student loans,” he said. “It’s 
a bill that will also revital-
ize our community colleges, 
which are a career pathway to 
the children of so many work-
ing families.”
While the government 
works to create more college 
graduates and strengthen 
community colleges, Carn-
egie Mellon President Jared 
Cohon emphasized that Carn-
egie Mellon would not ?t ei-
ther of these two categories. 
“We are not going to grow in 
size. We won’t be graduating 
more students.... However, 
there’s a way that we are al-
ready helping,” Cohon said, 
referring to Obama’s men-
tion of “educational software 
that’s as effective and engag-
ing as a personal tutor.”
“We have already created 
what everybody acknowledg-
es to be the best class of that 
force,” Cohon said. “We have 
already created OLI [Open 
Learning Initiative], which 
comes out of path-breaking 
research from our faculty, 
and this has received a lot of 
attention from the Obama ad-
ministration, and they have 
been very supportive and will 
support us more to develop 
and migrate courses to com-
munity colleges.”
In terms of energy, Obama 
referenced the Deepwater 
Horizon oil spill in the Gulf 
of Mexico as a reason to push 
for the future of clean energy. 
“We also have to acknowledge 
that an America run solely on 
fossil fuels should not be the 
vision we have for our chil-
dren and our grandchildren,” 
he said.
Lee Branstetter, an associ-
ate professor of economics 
and public policy, emphasized 
what Obama’s push for clean 
energy could mean for the U.S. 
economy. “Trying to make the 
political case for transition 
to [a] cleaner economy, it 
makes sense to emphasize job 
creation. The installation of 
windmills, solar power facili-
ties, development of nuclear 
power plants, development of 
natural gas plants — all of this 
installation and construction 
is fairly labor-constructive. If 
you have a policy in place that 
leads to rapid introduction of 
these technologies, then yes, 
you will create these jobs.”
However, while Branstet-
ter spoke in praise of a price 
on carbon emissions — “As 
an economist, I was pleased 
to see the emphasis the presi-
dent placed on that policy,” 
he said — he believes there is 
still work to be done in bring-
ing this message to the popu-
lace. 
“As the public is taking 
stock of the oil spill, this is a 
moment where [the] average 
American may be prompted 
to reconsider reliance on fos-
sil fuel as a national energy 
strategy,” he said. “I also think 
it’s true that most voters do 
not understand what it means 
to put a price on carbon; what 
they hear is you are going 
to put a price on my import 
that makes it more expen-
sive. There hasn’t been an 
effort to reach out to voters 
and educate them on the is-
sue using language they can 
understand.”
In his focus on innova-
tion as the route to change in 
economy, education, and en-
ergy, Obama aligned his mes-
sage with the spirit of Pitts-
burgh. “And when that [steel] 
industry shrank and so many 
jobs were lost, who could 
have guessed that Pittsburgh 
would fare better than many 
other Rust Belt cities and re-
emerge as a center for tech-
nology and green jobs, health 
care, and education?” he said.
As with the G-20 sum-
mit held here in September 
2009, Pittsburgh continues 
to serve as an example of suc-
cess through the recent reces-
sion. Cohon is aware of the 
attention this brings to the 
university. “As the president 
said, Pittsburgh is a leading 
example of an industrial city 
that has transformed itself 
economically, and I think the 
administration recognizes 
that Carnegie Mellon is a 
major actor in that ongoing 
transformation,” Cohon said.
And while most reacted 
positively to the president’s 
appearance on campus, oth-
ers were disappointed in the 
small size of the event and it 
being “invitation only.” 
Negative sentiment was 
also expressed by individuals 
outside of the campus com-
munity. Alex Lotorto, an East 
Liberty resident and Indus-
trial Workers of the World 
member, held a large sign 
reading “FREE GAZA” outside 
the event. Lotorto hoped to 
express his discontent at the 
president’s visit and the poli-
cies that he has implemented.
The government’s re-
sponse to Lotorto’s expression 
was not what he had hoped. 
“The state police and Secret 
Service showed up at my 
house to question my mom. I 
was upset and angry because 
it stressed her out and it is un-
fair that they would do some-
thing like that, and I’m look-
ing into violation of my civil 
rights,” Lotorto said.
Regardless of the poten-
tial unfairness of Lotorto’s 
situation, the community was 
forced to deal with serious se-
curity surrounding the event, 
as well as an entire day of 
closed campus services in the 
University Center. 
These measures were 
deemed necessary, though, 
as the administration chose 
to host President Obama, 
positioning Carnegie Mellon 
as a center of innovation as 
it plans for the future of the 
country and the remainder of 
Obama’s term and beyond.

Carnegie Mellon students, 
faculty, alumni, and members 
of the surrounding communi-
ty gathered in the Morewood 
parking lot on Thursday af-
ternoon for the of?cial kick-
off of Spring Carnival, the 
Midway Opening Ceremony, 
made even more special by 
the fact that it was kicking off 
the 100th Carnival.
The ceremony featured 
speeches from Head of Booth 
and senior information sys-
tems major Rachel Crown, 
Dean of Student Affairs Gina 
Casalegno, university Presi-
dent Subra Suresh, Pitts-
burgh Mayor Bill Peduto, and 
Spring Carnival Committee 
Co-Chairs senior lighting de-
sign major Jackson Gallagher 
and senior statistics major 
Emily Hrin, with the rest of 
the members of the Spring 
Carnival Committee watch-
ing from scaffolding behind 
them.
Many of the speakers ac-
knowledged Carnival’s im-
portance to the university 
community, a nod to the fact 
that this is Carnegie Mellon’s 
100th Carnival.
“Carnival is a tradition 
we all hold very dear in our 
hearts,” Hrin said. “Carnival 
has existed for a hundred 
years while the university has 
lasted for about 110. So Car-
nival started very early on in 
this university’s life.”
“There’s one common 
theme that stands true 
throughout the last hundred 
years of Carnival in that it is 
the time for the entire cam-
pus body to come together, 
unite, and have a weekend 
of fun and excitement,” Gal-
lagher said.
“I didn’t realize how im-
portant the hundred year 
anniversary was until [Hrin] 
said that Carnegie Mellon’s 
only been around for 110 
years,” said sophomore me-
chanical engineering major 
Deepak Gopalakrishnan.
 “After watching the cer-
emony, I understand why it’s 
a big deal, why the hundred 
year anniversary is so impor-
tant,” he said.
Other speakers remarked 
on the varied traditions of 
Carnival and their evolution 
over time, mentioning Buggy, 
Booth, plank jousting, cir-
cuses, canoe tilts, and bear 
wrestling.
“[Booth] is only the begin-
ning of what carnival has to 
offer,” Casalegno said. “This 
year, and like in the past 
several years, Booth is a rep-
resentation of the ways that 
Carnival has grown over the 
last hundred years.”
“[Carnival] is a celebra-
tion of everything that is 
CMU, through the buggies, 
and the booths ... and every-
thing else that is a part of it 
that brings the alumni and 
the community back,” Peduto 
said.
Many speakers com-
mented on the pride in Carn-
egie Mellon and fellow stu-
dents that Spring Carnival 
generates.
“[Carnival] is the best 
weekend to be a Tartan at 
Carnegie Mellon,” Casalegno 
said.
“In a uniquely Carnegie 
Mellon way, this event also 
brings together the creative 
spirit of the Carnegie Mellon 
community,” Suresh said.
Carnival’s ability to con-
nect Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents and alumni with the 
surrounding Pittsburgh 
neighborhoods and foster a 
sense of community was also 
a popular topic.
“Carnival is one of the city 
of Pittsburgh’s longest run-
ning traditions,” Peduto said. 
“It is something that not only 
includes the university but 
the community as well.”
“In addition to being a tra-
dition, the Carnival has also 
evolved over the last several 
years as the main focal point 
to connect with the region 
and the city,” Suresh said.
Each speaker thanked the 
Spring Carnival Committee, 
as well as other members of 
the Carnegie Mellon commu-
nity, who gave their time and 
efforts to create this year’s 
Carnival.
“I liked that the Carnival 
Committee was up on the 
scaffolds during the whole 
ceremony,” said Sloane 
Macklin, a ?rst-year biomedi-
cal engineering and materi-
als science and engineering 
double major. “I liked that 
they got recognition for all 
their hard work.”
The ceremony concluded 
with the cutting of the ribbon 
to Midway’s entrance and a 
performance by the Carnegie 
Mellon Kiltie Band.
“Let’s cut this ribbon and 
get this party started!” Pedu-
to said.
CMU celebrates 100th Carnival
‘First Lectures’ series debuts with Chadderton, MacGillivray
APRIL 20, 2014
Chloe Thompson 
Senior biological sciences 
and psychology major Lindsay 
MacGillivray and civil and en-
vironmental engineering and 
engineering and public policy 
double major Colin Chadder-
ton gave lectures on the mean-
ing of success last Thursday. 
The talks took place in Porter 
Hall, and were part of a series 
called The First Lectures, an 
initiative hosted by Student 
Senate and spearheaded by 
?rst-year economics and sta-
tistics double major Vaasavi 
Unnava. The First Lectures are 
meant as a homage to Randy 
Pausch’s The Last Lecture, 
which talked about achieving 
your childhood dreams. The 
topic of both Chadderton and 
MacGillivray’s speeches was 
the meaning of success.
Chadderton spoke ?rst, 
and took the stage dressed in 
a dark blue onesie, which he 
took off during his introduc-
tion to reveal a more con-
ventional button-down shirt. 
“We’re just gonna roll with it. 
It’s gonna be fun,” Chadder-
ton said. His lecture relied on 
PowerPoint slides that illus-
trated his talking points, the 
most salient of which were a 
series of “peaks and valleys” 
Chadderton experienced 
during his time at Carnegie 
Mellon.
Chadderton described 
how his ?rst year of school 
was academically overwhelm-
ing, and he struggled to keep 
up with his classes. He stated 
that he compared himself 
to his classmates and found 
himself lacking. However, he 
eventually found his footing 
by asking for help and getting 
more organized. He said “I 
learned how to survive here. 
But to thrive here, I needed 
to change my de?nition of 
worth.”
He went on to describe the 
importance of doing your best 
and not only comparing your-
self to others. Soon after, he 
became an RA. Chadderton 
said that being part of Student 
Life taught him the impor-
tance of being comfortable 
even in uncomfortable situa-
tions and that life is a ?shbowl 
and people are always paying 
attention. Therefore, it is al-
ways important to be mindful 
of one’s behavior.
Chadderton’s ?nal point 
in his lecture was the impor-
tance of accepting change, 
because people become ex-
tremely different over the 
course of a single day. Chad-
derton framed that as a good 
and natural thing, saying, “If 
you’re the same person you 
were three months ago, you 
aren’t doing it right.”
MacGillivray took a 
slightly different approach 
to the topic of success. She 
opened her presentation with 
various pieces of advice she’d 
received in her life, such as, 
“you learn the most from your 
friends,” which one of her 
friends told her, and “always 
undercook your brownies,” 
which her mother told her.
MacGillivray also 
discussed her academic trou-
bles at the inception of her ca-
reer here at Carnegie Mellon. 
She struggled, but thought 
that her dif?culties meant 
that she should be at a dif-
ferent school. Unfortunately, 
this became a circuitous prob-
lem. As a former mechanical 
engineering major, MacGil-
livray was unhappy with her 
coursework. She said “I didn’t 
like what I was studying, so 
I didn’t work very hard, so I 
didn’t do well, which meant 
I didn’t like what I was study-
ing.” Ultimately, MacGillivray 
changed her major and be-
came much happier and more 
successful in her classes.
The next point in MacGil-
livray’s lecture was a more sci-
enti?c examination of what 
success is. She came to the 
conclusion that success begets 
success — as the feeling of 
success makes one part of the 
brain light up, these chemical 
signals can travel to different 
parts of the brain, which con-
tinues the cycle. 
MacGillivray emphasized 
that an important part of 
feeling successful is check-
ing on one’s endeavors more 
frequently.
MacGillivray urged her au-
dience to break success down 
into more manageable sizes. 
“I propose we look at success 
in smaller pieces,” she said.
MacGillivray also stressed 
the importance of changing 
tactics that are not effective. 
“If you haven’t been success-
ful once, you can’t just try 
harder.”

Glasner, Ray elected as SBP, SBVP in 2014 StuGov elections
APRIL 7, 2014
Brent Heard
Junior electrical and com-
puter engineering and busi-
ness administration double 
major Ian Glasner was elected 
student body president (SBP) 
and junior biological sciences 
major Shalini Ray was elected 
student body vice president 
(SBVP).
Additionally, the student 
body voted sophomore electri-
cal and computer engineering 
major Divya Kothandapani 
as student body vice presi-
dent for ?nance (SBVPF) and 
sophomore computer science 
and math double major Jack 
Michalak as student body vice 
president for organizations 
(SBVPO).
Student voter turnout 
showed a slight increase over 
previous years, with 17.9 per-
cent of total students voting. 
32.21 percent of undergradu-
ate students cast their votes, 
as compared to 30 percent in 
2013. Graduate student voting 
decreased, however, with only 
3.32 percent of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s graduate population vot-
ing, a small drop from the 3.94 
percent who voted in 2013.
Glasner and Ray ran their 
SBP/SBVP ticket on a plat-
form of getting students more 
involved in their representa-
tion, promising to push for a 
number of reforms including 
restructuring dining plans to 
be more desirable to upper-
classmen and changing the 
school’s dorm alcohol policy 
to one which uses an internal 
system rather than one which 
involves the police, similar to 
the system currently in place 
at Ivy League universities.
While not designating 
one policy as a top priority, 
Glasner said, “I’m very pas-
sionate about dining, and I’m 
also passionate about looking 
into the current alcohol policy 
on campus.”
“I think every change that I 
want to happen is going to be 
a year’s process, if not more,” 
Glasner continued. “So, get-
ting them all started at the 
beginning of the year is going 
to mean weekly meetings with 
administration, bringing stu-
dents on board, and getting 
student feedback.”
Kothandapani campaigned 
on her experience serving on 
the university’s Joint Funding 
Committee (JFC) and prom-
ised to provide an easier-to-
understand budget process for 
student organizations.
Kothandapani said that 
“starting the application for 
next year’s JFC reps” would 
be her ?rst task when taking 
of?ce.
Michalak built his cam-
paign around a set of reforms 
beginning with the organi-
zation recognition process, 
setting up a better system for 
student organizations to re-
ceive advice, and creating an 
improved system for room reg-
istration. 
Michalak recalled the wish-
es of current SBVPO and inter-
national relations and politics 
and psychology double major 
Corinne Rockoff. “She really 
wanted someone with the ex-
perience to take over the posi-
tion,” Michalak said. “I wanted 
to be able to make sure some-
body with the experience rele-
vant to the position got it, and 
the best way to do that was to 
run.”
“A lot of people see the or-
ganizations of Carnegie Mel-
lon as the bread and butter of 
the university,” Michalak said, 
stating that he wished to im-
mediately focus on improving 
the organization recognition 
process and encourage gradu-
ate student participation and 
representation in student or-
ganizations.
Ray spoke of her joint can-
didacy with Glasner, saying, 
“It ended up being the per-
fect relationship, because we 
weren’t best buddies before 
we came in, so we had that 
sense of respect for each other. 
But now we get along so well; 
we will crack jokes with each 
other all the time.” She add-
ed, “It’s great. I honestly love 
working with him.”
“From what I’ve seen so far, 
we work very well together,” 
Glasner agreed. “There hasn’t 
been too much experience on 
the working relationship be-
tween the two of us because 
the work’s just started.”
Ray encouraged students, 
saying, “Don’t be hesitant to 
approach us with anything. 
We have enough experience to 
make things work.”
Glasner stated that he was 
honored to have been elected 
as SBP and said, “I really want 
to help improve the student 
experience at Carnegie Mel-
lon, and if anyone has good 
ideas, I absolutely want them 
to share them with me. I look 
forward to a productive year.”

Carnival concert decided
MARCH 24, 2014
Lilah Buchanan
After much anticipation, 
Activities Board (AB) 
Concerts announced on 
Wednesday at 11:59 p.m. 
this year’s Spring Carnival 
concert performers: Icona 
Pop and Mac Miller. Icona 
Pop is a Swedish DJ duo 
with an emphasis on 
electro house and indie 
pop. 
The duo gained 
attention in the United 
States for their song “I Love 
It” in 2012. Mac Miller, 
a rapper and Pittsburgh 
native, is most popular for 
his song “Party on Fifth 
Ave.”
AB Concerts co-chairs 
junior computer science 
major Rebecca Paren and 
senior human-computer 
interaction and business 
administration double 
major Ronny Ho explained 
their selection, saying that 
because it’s so dif?cult 
to please the campus as 
whole, they liked the idea 
of selecting two distinct 
artists to appeal to a wider 
audience.
The selection process 
started with a collective 
brainstorming session, Ho 
said. “Literally on a chalk 
board — everyone just 
name-drops artists and 
bands,” Ho described.
Paren and Ho are 
excited for Mac Miller; 
they both liked the idea 
of featuring an artist from 
the Pittsburgh area for the 
100th Spring Carnival. 
They are also excited to 
host an up-and-coming 
foreign group like Icona 
Pop.
The student body’s 
reaction is mixed. Icona 
Pop has generally garnered 
more excitement than 
Mac Miller.  The co-chairs 
explained that the AB 
Concerts board always 
expects mixed feelings 
about their decisions.
“We want the student 
body to understand we 
aren’t choosing people we 
love.” Paren said, “Our 
musical interests do not 
in?uence who we pick. We 
want to do what’s best for 
the campus with the money 
and timing we have.”

A modern day telenovela
Jane the Virgin an honest portrayal Latin-American culture
The typical Latin-American teenager has seen 
their fair share of telenovelas. From watching 
RBD perform in Rebelde in Middle School, to a 
million other shows about people staring at each 
other for excruciatingly long periods of time, the 
telenovela is a cultural phenomenon in all of Latin 
America — it is one of the unifying threads for all 
of us. The difference that makes Jane the Virgin 
so good is that, unlike with telenovelas, the show 
is rooted in reality and has amazing actors that 
make the characters personable.
The basic premise of the show is simple: Jane 
is a virgin, but she is also pregnant after getting 
accidentally inseminated. The father is the 
owner of the hotel where she works; his wife was 
getting the insemination without his knowledge 
in order to get money out of him, and the doctor 
that inseminated Jane is the father’s sister.
From that point on, the storyline gets more 
complicated and intertwined, just like any good 
telenovela. The show, however, manages to put 
all of these storylines together and pulls it off 
with great aplomb. The reason why the show 
can make it work is simple: Gina Rodríguez. The 
breakout star that is Gina was mostly unknown 
in the entertainment industry until this point. 
She had some minor roles in some movies and a 
soap opera, but her portrayal of Jane in this show 
brought her to the mainstream and even gave her 
her first Golden Globe award.
That being said, she’s not the only shining 
star in the cast. Justin Baldoni, famous for his 
proposal that went viral a few years ago, plays 
Rafael Solano (the father of the baby) in a way 
that makes him bold and sincere and extremely 
approachable. Ivonne Coll, former Miss Puerto 
Rico, plays Alba Villanueva (Jane’s grandmother) 
as the classic latin grandmother: lovable, strict, 
wise, and always right. Her character is portrayed 
with perfect composure, and every Latin person 
will understand her role and connect with it. The 
fact that she only speaks Spanish and subtitles 
are shown when she speaks is a character choice 
that makes perfect sense. At the time she was 
supposed to have emigrated from Venezuela, she 
would not have been able to grasp the language 
as well as her daughter would, especially since 
her contact would have been mostly within the 
family. Coll can speak English perfectly, and she 
has done so in many other movies and TV shows, 
but this character choice really makes her the 
truest version of her character possible.
One of the better parts of the show is the 
inclusion of an actual telenovela star playing an 
overdramatic telenovela star (Jane’s estranged 
father who doesn’t know he has a daughter). 
Jaime Camil has starred in countless telenovelas 
and has hosted many other Spanish shows. 
His character is basically himself, but more 
grandiose, and much more driven by the fame 
that comes with being an actor. The character is 
essentially the comic relief of the show and can 
be so one-dimensional at times that his character 
becomes a great reason to watch the show.
Ultimately, the characters and their portrayal 
really drive this show and make it better than it 
would seem on paper. They stay rooted in reality 
and the actors portray them as honestly as they 
can, giving the show a sense of understanding of 
where they are and where they should be going. 
It’s an honest portrayal of a modern Latin family 
living under a series of very rare — yet very 
plausible — circumstances.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
My ex is coming back for 
Carnival, and she texted me 
last night asking if I wanted 
to hang out with her 
over the weekend. I was 
planning on being cross-
faded out of my mind for 
my last Carnival — nothing 
beats fried Oreos and 
Booth while you’re tripping 
— but if I say yes, I’m going 
to have to stay pretty sober, 
so that I don’t do anything 
stupid like follow her when 
I graduate. She lives in 
Detroit, and I’d rather not 
end up trying to find a job 
or internship there. 
I mean, are there even any 
jobs in Detroit?
Flummoxed,
EXpecting Overzealous 
Debauchery Upon Sight
Dear EX-ODUS,
Why do you need to be 
sober when you see her? 
She’ll probably understand, 
and she’ll probably be pretty 
plastered, too. If not, well, you 
hold no obligation to show 
yourself at your best. So what 
if you flirt with her unabashedly 
at a party, then shout that you 
see a little silhouetto of a man 
— Scaramouch! Scaramouch! 
— and ask him to do the 
fandango? It’s Carnival — 
anything goes.
If you have attachment issues, 
it won’t be hard to avoid 
your ex. There are at least 50 
parties you can go to at any 
point during the weekend; if 
you know she’s going to one 
on Beeler, just head to the 
house across the street.
Or buy all the fried Oreos 
at Booth eat them at home 
every night,
Evan Kahn
Dear Evan,
Yesterday, one of my 
professors spent our 
entire recitation lecturing 
us on how to dress for 
interviews. Her suggestions 
were trite, and her 
borderline-offensive tone 
made everyone pretty 
uncomfortable. When she 
used pictures of people 
in class to illustrate her 
point, I got up and left out 
of anger.
How can I best make her 
feel bad about ruining our 
recitation?
Irked,
Puked Robustly Out of 
Unfettered Displeasure, 
Speculating Lashing Out at 
Buffoon
Dear PROUD SLOB,
She’s harping on how 
Carnegie Mellon students 
dress? She may as well be 
telling Kanye how to speak at 
awards ceremonies. It’s futile.
But really, who takes class 
time away to comment on 
their students’ appearances, 
unless they’re distracting from 
the learning environment? You 
should complain to the Dean. 
That’s just plain insulting.
Or put warm taffy on her 
chair and ruin her Versace 
dress,
Evan Kahn

4film festival
pillbox 04.13.15
Saturday night marked the end of the almost month-long 
run of Carnegie Mellon’s student-run International Film 
Festival: Faces of Work.
The small audience in McConomy Auditorium listened 
to the kind words of thanks that Festival Director Jolanta 
Lion gave to students who helped her and individuals who 
supported the ?lm festival. Lauralei Kraski, assistant to the 
director, also expressed her appreciation to those who put 
so much time into the festival’s construction, as well as 
audience members, many of whom went to multiple ?lm 
festival showings.
Prior to the screening of the evening’s feature ?lm, 
the audience was shown a documentary short by the 
late Professor Paul S. Goodman, to whom the festival 
was dedicated. In addition to being a professor of 
organizational psychology at Carnegie Mellon, Goodman 
was the director of the Institute for Strategic Development 
and the director of the Center for the Management of 
Technology. Much beloved by the university community, 
Goodman was also an avid ?lmmaker responsible for 
numerous short documentaries chronicling individuals in 
the workplace and detailing how work was and is de?ned 
in America.
The short showed at the ?lm festival was called Waitress. 
It consisted of narration by Goodman, and extensive 
interviews with Toni, a waitress with 23 years of 
experience at Scotty’s Diner here in Pittsburgh. Though 
a little campy, the ?lm was satisfying and, dare I say 
it, adorably dated, having been ?lmed in 1996. The ten 
minutes or so of the ?lm included very ’90s hairstyles 
in addition to some interesting re?ections on being a 
waitress from Toni. It was gratifying to witness the work of 
a Carnegie Mellon professor be so appreciated.
The ?nal ?lm in the Festival, an Indian ?lm from 2014, 
Court, dealt with so many themes that it was a little 
dif?cult to understand the ?lm’s message. Though that 
might have been a part of the ?lm’s artistic point, Director 
Chaitanya Tamhane’s ?rst feature production dealt with 
issues of bureaucracy, artistic expression, classism, and 
racism throughout. The ?lm follows the incarceration and 
court dates of self-proclaimed “folk musician” Narayan 
Kamble, who is brought into court on the transparently 
?awed charge of “abetting suicide.” The prosecution 
claims that Kamble incited a sewer worker to commit 
suicide after allegedly encouraging all sewer workers to 
kill themselves. What follows is an understated and honest 
portrayal of India’s ?awed justice system. Kamble’s trial 
is postponed multiple times, the investigating of?cer 
collaborates with the only witness for the prosecution, and 
all the while Kamble’s health deteriorates in a prison cell.
Kamble’s devoted lawyer Vinay Vora seems resigned 
whenever they postpone the trial to a date, often a month 
or more in the future even after just a few minutes of 
procedure. There is no outcry for court reform in the 
movie. Once, prosecutor Nutan complains about the 
duration of this trial, but she does not frame it explicitly as 
a fault of the system. In this particular conversation, she 
discusses the speed with which judges can get through 
cases that come to court. This sort of conversation, 
skirting around the edge of the issue at hand, is largely 
what makes the ?lm’s critiques so powerful.
The private lives of Vora and Nutan bring to light a 
fascinating dichotomy. Vora comes from a family of great 
wealth. His position as a lawyer is not the most frugal 
or the most natural for a man of his status. There exists 
tension, but also extreme luxury. One scene shows Vora 
hanging out with friends in an upscale bar with live, 
Western-style music, in comparison to Kamble’s folk 
music. In another scene he picks up a plethora of very 
fancy cheeses in a nice grocery store. Even though he 
comes from a place of elevated status, Vora still wishes 
to help those less fortunate than himself. He feels a moral 
responsibility for his clients that are victims of the system, 
such as Kamble.
On the other hand, public defender Nutan comes from a 
social strata more similar to those who are facing court 
charges. Though she is not an evil character, Nutan does 
not feel the same level of social responsibility.
Chock-a-block full of thought-provoking contradictions, 
Court is a nuanced exploration of various social issues in 
India. Though I think it would have been useful to enter 
the ?lm knowing a little bit more about the Indian legal 
system and social issues of the area, the ?lm managed to 
convey many important points I understood, despite my 
personal ignorance.
Most importantly, Court closed Carnegie Mellon’s Film 
Festival powerfully. The fact that Carnegie Mellon is the 
home of the only student-run international ?lm festival in 
the country is truly amazing. Movies have the power to 
transcend cultures, religions, and ideologies, making ?lm 
a powerful tool for educating people around the globe. 
I sincerely hope to see next year’s attendance to this 
spectacular month of thoughtful art increase.

Asking the big questions about love
Editor of the New York Times Modern Love Column promotes book Love Illuminated
“Do you think it’s better to put a lot of effort into 
?nding love, or leave it to fate?”
That’s the ?rst question of Daniel Jones’ quiz, a love 
quiz he felt was important to put in his new book, 
Love Illuminated. 
Daniel Jones, the Editor of the New York Times 
Modern Love Column, wants you to know that he 
doesn’t know much about love. For the last 10 years, 
he’s been reading millions of stories from all across 
the country where people open their hearts to him in 
letters and e-mails. He’s listened, read, thought about, 
was inspired by, felt sad and angry, but if you ask him 
about love, and what it means, how to get it, and how 
to keep it, he is as clueless as the rest of us.
On Wednesday night, in a small crowded classroom 
at the University of Pittsburgh, members of the 
Pittsburgh community gathered to hear from the man 
who has read it all. Five minutes before the event 
started, I looked around the room to see many young 
college students of all genders scrolling through their 
newsfeeds, sitting side by side with elderly couples 
adjusting their hearing aids.
It’s curious how at all phases in our lives, we’re drawn 
to a conversation in the hope of learning more about 
love.
But Jones made it clear: He doesn’t have answers. 
But the audience was not there simply for answers, 
neat ends, or instructions. Jones’ conversation incited 
the audience to talk about the messiness of love. He 
didn’t limit the evening to a discussion of romantic 
love as he touched on the complexities of the love 
of parents, children, and complicated emotions that 
are introduced by death, and even the way love is 
experienced through the adoption of a child.
Jones encouraged the audience to talk about 
questions, ones that are complicated and messy. 
Questions ranged from ones that addressed modern 
day expressions of affection and sentiment, such as 
“Do you think a relationship conducted purely online, 
via words, images, emoticons, and texting shorthand 
can be as ful?lling as or possibly even more ful?lling 
than one conducted in person?” to the age old, “How 
much self-sacri?ce can love reasonably require? And 
what happens when the person you promised to love 
no longer seems to be the person you’re married to?”.
This is how Jones’ book is structured. Love 
Illuminated has 10 different chapters, each of which 
focuses on big, messy questions and pulls incredible, 
thought-provoking stories from his column.
During the event, Jones spoke in a quiet and humble 
tone. He told lots of jokes, but he didn’t come across 
as pompous. Two authors joined him during the event: 
Pitt professor Aubrey Hirsh, who wrote a Modern Love 
column titled, “In Matters of the Heart We’re In This 
Together” about a literal and metaphorical heartbreak, 
and Lori Jakiela who wrote “The Plain, Unmarked Box 
Arrived” about a sex chair for herself and her husband.
When you read some of these columns, you can see 
why Jones selects these stories. They are poignant 
and important and well-written.
Jones also told us an important story about how he 
met his wife. In it, he answers the question, “If a word 
like destiny makes you gag, should you still try to 
believe in it?”.
I read Love Illuminated at a time when I needed 
it. After recognizing a huge distance between 
my perception of love and some messiness I was 
experiencing, I turned to the internet to ?nd answers. 
It’s easy to ?nd answers about love on the internet. 
Google “how to know if someone cares about you,” 
or “how to know when it’s time to break up” and 
you’ll ?nd tons of so-called experts who promise that 
raised eyebrows mean interest and no phone call 
for 48 hours means a break-up. But oftentimes we 
are self-con?rming in our searches. We only register 
information that we want to hear. That’s why the book 
and the column are so refreshing. After reading, I 
didn’t know a single new “rule” about love; instead I 
had a better framework for understanding about why 
I may have had such unrealistic expectations in the 
?rst place.
Jones’ book, column, and incredible Emmy-nominated 
animated video series offer the kind of advice people 
can use to grow rather than “know.” Love is messy 
and unique and dif?cult and short and long and real 
and imaginary. It is whatever you experience it to be.
When an audience member asked if his views on love 
are more pessimistic or optimistic after Jones ?nished 
reading, he says that many readers ask him why the 
column is so depressing. There are not very many 
happy endings, because in life there are also not many 
happy endings. However, Jones says he’s optimistic 
because despite a lack of fairy tale weddings, he says 
that he feels learning from an experience is the most 
important part. “If you go through something, and 
learn something … that’s an optimistic concept for 
me.”

Watching Chekhov’s Three Sisters at Purnell’s Philip Chosky 
Theatre was seeing reality splayed across a 19th-century 
Russian backdrop. The characters are authentic — hopeful 
and hurting and ?awed, so real that their lives seem to spill 
over into ours. And despite, or perhaps because of, the 
constant meditations on posterity, the entire production 
seems incredibly immediate, as if it were written last week 
instead of a hundred years ago. The themes — love, family, 
death and enlightenment — are as timeless as writing itself. 
Who hasn’t longed for a bygone time, a lost love, or a better 
future at some point?
Pamela Berlin, director of the Three Sisters, manages a 
heavy, lumbering machine with numerous turning wheels. 
Make no mistake, there are no one-dimensional characters 
here. Each and every one is ?eshed out, given meaning, 
motivation and an overarching story intricate enough to exist 
as a stand-alone play. Even so, they all seem to come together 
and complement each other, not like neat pieces in a puzzle, 
but like we might do with our own friends and family. 
Speaking of us, as the audience, we’re always aware of the 
multiplicity of personalities elbowing each other for space on 
the larger canvas, which is itself barely capable of keeping it 
all contained. Even so, Berlin effectively brings it all together 
with extraordinary delicacy and balance.
The play starts with the three sisters just entering adulthood, 
full of dreams and optimism. Olga, the eldest, played by 
senior acting major Kelsey Carthew, is the maternal ?gure 
in the family. Kind and caring, particularly to her household 
servants, she is a teacher at the local high school. Masha, the 
middle sister, played by senior acting major Colleen Pulawski, 
is somewhat unhappy with her marriage, and falls head over 
heels for the idealistic Lieutenant-Colonel Vershinin in the 
opening scene. The most direct character by far, Masha has 
a caustic wit that is a frequent source of humor. Irina, the 
youngest, played by senior acting major Olivia Lemmon, 
is an unabashed idealist. Fascinated by trivial things like a 
spinning top, she longs to return to the hustle and bustle of 
Moscow, and disdains the inertia that has befallen the so-
called “gentry” of Russia.
Another important character is the brother of the three: 
Andrei, played by senior acting major Ben Edelman. He 
starts out as a man of learning, on the fast track to becoming 
a professor in Moscow. He also happens to be in love with 
a commoner called Natasha, much to the chagrin of the 
rest of his family. Natasha, played by senior acting major 
Cathryn Dylan, is another central character. She starts out a 
victim, mocked for her taste by the others, before going on to 
ironically turn the tables on the others.
All said and done, however, Three Sisters is no family soap 
opera. What was even more impressive than the depth of 
personalities was the depth of ideas on display. Characters 
ruminate on imposing ideas: Where will the world be in 
a hundred years, why do we need to do good productive 
work, how can we leave a legacy for eternity, and what is the 
purpose of knowledge, if not for the sake of itself? Besides 
being openly debated and discussed, these ideas are the 
underlying motivations that lead characters to make the 
decisions they do. Ultimately, I felt like I was watching life 
play out as it does, unscripted and untidy, all the while being 
aware of the underlying framework governing it all.
There are also no big, climactic events in Three Sisters. 
Earth shattering developments occur throughout, yet they 
are never given center stage. Instead, the audience sees a 
?uid stream of anticlimaxes that we come to terms with long 
after the fact. Three Sisters is undoubtedly an exhausting 
performance to watch, because it hits us little by little, until 
we are eventually aware of everything that has transpired 
before our eyes. The grand optimism expressed in the ?rst 
act is gradually killed by a thousand cuts that we don’t see 
coming until the very end, by which point we are far too 
invested to not be heartbroken.
Three Sisters might make you smile, or it might make 
you cry. The characters might win your empathy for their 
struggles, or they might garner your disdain for their 
vapidness. What the entire experience will de?nitely make 
you do, however, is think. You’ll think about yourself, your 
friends and family, and your world at large, and come to 
realize that even though there may be uncertainty and 
darkness at every turn ahead, it’s the little things that add up 
to light the way.

Kiltie Band Concert.
Thursday, April 16. 3:30-4:30 p.m. Midway Main Tent.
Come hear the dulcet tones of one of Carnegie Mellon’s 
most beloved — and weirdest — musical ensembles. 
Even if you are just walking around Midway, you are 
sure to hear the wonderful musical talents of Carnegie 
Mellon students. Self-recognized as “the band without 
pants,” Kiltie Band is guaranteed to take you on a 
slightly confusing, bizarre, hat-oriented, and energetic 
musical journey.
AB’s Spring Carnival Comedy Show. 
Thursday, April 16. 7:30-9:30 p.m. Midway Main Tent.
Rain location: Wiegand Gym.
Two of HBO’s Silicon Valley regulars are coming to 
Carnegie Mellon for an evening of near-constant 
laughter. Tom Middleditch is opening for Kumail 
Nanjiani, and both promise to be an absolute riot. 
Last year’s Spring Carnival Show, hosted by Activities 
Board, featured comedian Tig Notaro yelling at a 
student blankly eating a turkey leg, and headliner 
Hannibal Buress making completely justi?ed fun 
of Google Glass. If you are a fan of comedians, self-
deprecation, and trying new things, try to make it to 
the Comedy Show. Snag a ticket off someone who has 
one, but doesn’t feel like going for whatever reason. 
They are lame, and you will have a hugely fun evening.
Carnival Fireworks.
Thursday, April 16. 9:00 p.m. Midway.

Take part in the beautiful and colorful festivities, 
during which people get covered with colored powder 
and everybody runs around in the meadow and takes 
comfort in the fact that the miserable Pittsburgh winter 
is over. Though not explicitly artistic, the colors — and 
the food that will be served (if you have a ticket) — will 
de?nitely make an emotional impression.
Shot for Shot Student Film Festival.
Friday, April 17. 7:30 p.m. McConomy Auditorium.
Organized by the Carnegie Mellon Film Club, Shot for

conversation about the ?lms, as well as connect young, 
aspiring ?lmmakers to professionals already working 
in the ?eld. An often hidden community at Carnegie 
Mellon, the whole campus can take advantage of 
this showcase to see what young ?lmmakers here in 
Pittsburgh are up to.
Scotch’n’Soda’s Merrily We Roll Along.
Friday, April 17. 2 p.m. and 7 p.m.
Saturday, April 18. 2 p.m. and 11 p.m. McConomy 
Auditorium.
Steven Sondheim’s tour de force musical Merrily 
We Roll Along is a poignant examination of all that 
friendship is, can be, and has been. Oftentimes sad, 
and sometimes gloriously happy, this beautiful musical 
explores all that friendships are, and how they endure 
— or do not endure — life’s complexities.
AB Spring Carnival Concert.
Saturday, April 18. 7:30 p.m. The Mall. 
Rain location: Wiegand Gym.
Matt & Kim are coming to Carnegie Mellon! Though 
tickets are sold out, anyone with a Carnegie Mellon 
ID can get into the show if it remains outside. Matt & 
Kim are amazing live performers, and the opener RJD2 
also promises to be fantastic. Even if you only know the 
song “Daylight,” listen to a couple others and head out 
to the Mall for an evening of dancing (or moshing) to 
music with some of your closest friends and a couple 
thousand of your favorite classmates.

Meryl Streep is a perfect human, so there’s no question as to why Into 
the Woods is so superb. A rather dark interpretation of some of our more 
classic fairytales, this live action version of Steven Sondheim’s award winning 
musical features an all-star cast. Emily Blunt plays the wife of a baker who 
cannot bear a child, so she and her husband embark on a quest to reverse 
the curse that made her so. The curse was set on her by a witch, played 
by the aforementioned Streep. Fairy tale heroes and enemies return in this 
entirely new adventure, including Little Red Riding Hood, Cinderella, and 
Rapunzel. Filled with luscious costumes and impressive CGI, the movie also 
boasts plenty of eye candy. Though some of the more controversial and 
graphic themes present in the musical were adapted to ?t a wider audience, 
Into the Woods is still a refreshing take on old classics.
Into the Woods
Thursday, Apr. 16
8 & 10:30 p.m.
Penguins of Madagascar
Saturday, Apr. 18
11:30 p.m.
Sunday, Apr. 19
7:30 p.m.
A spin-off of everyone’s favorite childhood DreamWorks ?lm, Madagascar, 
Penguins of Madagascar follows the further adventures of four crazy penguins. In 
this spin-off, the penguins are taken hostage by an octopus named Dave. Sounds 
almost too good to be true, right? What ensues is a fast-paced spy thriller starring 
various members of the animal kingdom with funny names. Though the penguins 
are not very bright and get captured numerous times, they eventually make it home 
scott-free. One of the best parts of the movie is Benedict Cumberbatch’s voice 
role as Classi?ed, a gray wolf who is part of a spy agency called “North Wind.” 
Radioactivity and mutation also play a role in this scattered, yet enjoyable, ?lm for 
all ages.

10opera
pillbox 04.13.15
This week, students in the School of Music performed 
their Annual Opera Scenes Showcase, which pulls 
selected scenes from seven different operas. It 
fell somewhere in between a live mixtape and an 
operatic variety show. The evening switched from 
story to story, cast to cast, and costume to costume, 
which kept the things exciting because we got to see 
the most interesting, exciting, and climactic scenes 
from each respective opera.
Kresge Theater in the College of Fine Arts was a 
much better venue for the show than Philip Chosky 
Theater over in Purnell would have been. Kresge is 
much more intimate and low key, which matched the 
vibe of the show. It was, of course, professionally and 
fantastically done, but it was more comfortable for 
the audience than the full-length operas performed 
in Chosky. Sets and costumes were simple to allow 
for the quick changes in story, but they were used to 
maximum effect. The whole night was aesthetically 
casual, but artistically breathtaking.
Before each scene, a student came out to present the 
plot of the entire opera, highlighting where the scene 
would begin and end, since all but one of the eight 
scenes would be in a language other than English.
Though all eight scenes were spectacular, I found two 
to be extra special.
The ?rst of those is Act 1, Scene 1 from L’enfant et les 
sortilèges, a French Opera by Maurice Ravel (the title 
translates from French into The Child and the Spells). 
The premise is like a fairy tale that takes a turn for 
the worse, and could be a horror movie for children, 
if that were a real genre. The opera tells the story of 
a young child, played by junior vocal performance 
major Shannon Rynker, who gets scolded by his 
mother and sent to his room. When he gets there he 
throws a temper tantrum, destroying his room. But 
then the objects in his room start to come to life to 
show him what he’s done.
First, the ?re comes to life because during his 
rage, he stirred it up. It comes out of the ?replace 
in the form of junior vocal performance major 
Rachel Doehring, who appears from a cloud of 
smoke in a dazzling red dress to sing a menacing 
aria to the little boy and the other items in the 
room. Finally she recedes, and turns the show 
over to the shepherds and shepherdesses in his 
wallpaper, which the boy attacked with the ?re 
poker. They emerge from the wall in torn clothing, 
singing of their sad fate. The harmonies in this 
piece, “Adieu, Pastourelle,” paired with the very 
stripped-down but deliberate choreography, made 
the entire experience haunting in a way that had 
me paralyzed in my seat as I almost felt their pain.
The ?nal step in the story comes from the 
princess in the story book that the child ripped 
up. Because the book was no longer intact, the 
princess would never get to be with her prince. 
For this scene, junior vocal performance major 
Hannah Nowicki walks out from backstage in 
a silver gown covered from hem to hem with 
sparkles, crowned with a tiara. Her song to the 
boy about her love that he took away was simply 
heartbreaking, and Nowicki’s light soprano voice 
was perfect for the role.
I think the simple elements of the production 
made this particular opera even more amazing. 
It really focused the attention onto the vocalists 
themselves, who performed their pieces with 
extraordinary skill.
The other opera scene that I was especially in 
awe of was Act 2, Scene 3 from Dialogues of the 
Carmelites, written by Francis Poulenc, which 
takes place during the beginning of the French 
Revolution. An old marquis and his son, Richard 
Marenda Jr., worry about Blanche, the Marquis’ 
very skittish daughter, easily startled and 
impressionable. They’re concerned for her fate 
during the revolution, but later she decides to join 
the convent and become a nun.
The scene opens when Blanche’s father and 
brother are about to leave Paris to escape the 
danger. Her brother comes to convince her to 
escape with them. The set is simply a bunch of 
chairs set up to represent pews, but each with LED 
lights on the bottom which made the lighting on 
the scene really stark and dramatic. As Blanche 
sings of her duty to the convent and her refusal to 
leave, she slowly and strategically places the chairs 
on their sides, creating shadows over the set and 
vocalists building up to a tense moment when 
she knocks the chairs down with a loud crash, 
commanding attention to not only her vocal power, 
but the strength of her very presence.
Where Chosky would have had an edge over 
Kresge is its captions monitor. When I attend 
the opera performances, I prefer having the 
translations in front of me so I can follow the 
plot exactly. But in this case, I got by. The 
performances were so strong and conveyed all 
the meaning I needed beyond the scene synopsis. 
The vocalists that performed not only sang like 
absolute professionals, they put on a show that I 
was excited to watch.
