VOL. V PITTSBURGH, PA., WEDN ESDAY, MAY 31, 1911. No. 33
CARNEGIE TECH 
IN THE NEAR FUTURE
As may be seen at a glance the accompanying cut 
of the present and proposed buildings of the Car­
negie Technical Schools, as prepared by Mr. Henry 
Hornbostel, Architect in charge of the designing and 
construction, that many improvements of importance 
to the students of the Schools are contemplated.
As at present planned, these improvements in­
clude a new approach to the buildings, lessening the 
distance from the Forbes street cars from 2800 to 
900 feet; a large building for the School of Applied 
Design; an addition to the Margaret Morrison Car­
negie School, equivalent in size to the present struc­
ture; additions to the Science and Industries groups, 
enlarged power plant; an Administration Building; 
and a Gymnasium and Stadium.
Excavation has already started in preparation of 
the site for the School of Applied Design. The hill 
at the head of the present Industries group will be 
cut away and used to fill the ravine between the pro­
posed bridge and the Woman’s School Building. This 
ravine will be filled to an elevation approximately 
12 feet above the level of the present athletic field, 
making sufficient ground for an adequate athletic 
field, etc., and a seating capacity of approximately 
12,000, which could later be increased materially, as 
required. The Gymnasium will occupy almost the 
entire building space underneath the bridge, which 
will be approximately 6o feet wide by 285 feet long, 
the gym proper being 60x160 and the balance of
space being taken up by swimming pool, indoor run­
ning track, offices, locker rooms, etc. The Commons 
will also occupy a portion of this building.
The School of Applied Design Building will occupy 
a site at the head of and facing the large open court. 
It will be approximately 260 feet long by 110 feet 
deep and will contain a small auditorium for lectures, 
plays, concerts, etc., a museum and art gallery, large 
drafting rooms, and ateliers. The studios will be at 
the top of the building with light from overhead as 
is the practice in the large ateliers abroad. There 
will be three stories, a mezzanine and high base­
ment. The entrance, which is imposing, will open 
upon an atrium 40 feet square by 50 feet high, on 
the right will be located the auditorium with a seat­
ing capacity of about 400. On the left is the art gal­
lery, 50 feet by 70 feet, containing permanent exhi­
bitions of the student’s work. The rear of the 
atrium will lead up a few steps to a wide corridor ex­
tending the full length of the building.
The architecture in the portion of the building 
above described will be handsome and will display 
specimen work for the students, containing casts 
and paintings of the best examples of art. The re­
mainder of the first and mezzanine floors will be oc­
cupied by executive offices, lecture rooms and labor­
atories. On the second floor will be a large drafting 
room for architects, 50 feet wide by 100 feet long. 
The remainder of the second floor will be devoted

---------------------------------------------------

4THE TARTAN
to small studios. The third floor will be occupied by 
the decorators and illustrators. They will have a 
long drafting room 25 feet by 150 feet, and off this 
drafting room will open the studios for freehand 
drawing, life ¿lass and painting.
The basement will extend under only a portion of 
the building and beside the usual arrangements for 
janitor and storage, there will be a large modeling 
atelier, 25x100 feet, finished in Venitian style. This 
room will be so arranged that it may also be used 
for a banquet hall. The above outline is all tenta­
tive and is still being studied but it is believed the 
finished building will follow along the general 
scheme as set forth. The building is expected to 
start in the fall.
The addition planned for the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School comprises another building of ap­
proximately the same design and capacity as the 
present building, connected by means of a covered 
teirace, underneath which will be located the gym­
nasium for women.
The new entrance by means of a bridge across the 
ravine at the end of the present Science group is 
plannned to open onto Forbes Street at a point ad­
jacent to Morewood Avenue and at the other end the 
road will pass through the court and on to Wood- 
awn Avenue.
Some of the improvements to be started immed­
iately include changing the assembly room in the 
Applied Industries Building so as to accommodate 
300 students; putting a gallery in the Machine Shop; 
arching over and finishing the hallways in the same 
building, and the excavation above referred to. A 
head-house or entrance will be built at the upper end 
of the present Science Group and several wings add­
ed at the other end.
NEW COURSE IN PAINTING.
The Applied Design School is going to add to its 
list of courses a course in painting.
This course includes painting from still life, from 
model in costume and in the nude; landscape paint­
ing; exercises in original, pictorial and decorative 
composition, etc.
The work is judged in competitions held accord­
ing to a calendar posted on the bulletin boards at 
the beginning of each school year.
It is divided into three classes as given below. The 
student must gain the credits required of each class 
before entering the next in advance.
Elementary Class C, 35 credits required of day stu­
dents, 25. of night students, to be gained in judg­
ments as follows: projets, 1st mention 5; 2nd men­
tion 3; 3rd mention 1; esquisse, 1st mention 3; 2nd 
mention 2.
Class B, 35 credits required of day students, 25 of 
night students, to be gained in judgments as follows; 
projets, 1st mention 5; 2nd mention 3; 3rd mention 
1; esquisse, 1st mention 3; 2nd mention 2. A day 
student shall be admttied to Class B, who (a) is in 
good standing; (b) who has completed the require­
ments in elementary class; (c) who has a total of 
15 credits in freehand drawing; (d) who has 5 cred­
its in modeling. A night student shall be admitted to 
Class B who (a) is in good standing, (b) has com­
pleted the requirements in elementary class; (c) has 
a total of 10 credits in freehand drawing.
Class A, 45 credits required of day students,' 35 
credits of night students to be gained in judgments 
as follows: projets, 1st mention 10; 2nd mention 5; 
3rd mention 2; esquisses, 1st mention 3; 2nd men­
tion 2. A day student shall be admitted to Class A 
who (a) is in good standing; (b) has completed the 
requirements in Class B; (c) has a total of 35 cred­
its in freehand drawing; (d) a total of 10 credits in 
modeling. A night student shall be admitted to Class 
A who (a) is in good standing; (b) has completed 
the requirements in Class B, (c) has a total of 20 
credits in freehand drawing.
The organization of a summer class in painting 
is dependent upon the registration of a sufficiently 
large group of students to warrant it. It will be or­
ganized each year provided at least fifteen students 
have registered and paid the tuition charge of $20 
each on or before the first of May. The summer camp 
of instruction which will be conducted each year on 
the Carneg|e Farm affords excellent facilities for the 
work of a summer class. This camp is situated in 
the midst of a picturesque landscape of wide valleys, 
wooded hills, brooks and rivers.
GAS PRODUCER TEST.
A test of a 75 horsepower gas producer manufact­
ured by the Amsler Gas Power Co., of this city will 
be conducted in the Machinery Hall under the sup­
ervision of Professor Trinks.
The producer is now being erected by Hobbs Bros, 
of these Schools under the personal supervision of 
Mr. Amsler. Mr. Amsler, who is quite a specialist 
in this line of work is a Cornell man and has con­
tributed quite a quantity of original matter bearing 
on the gas turbine, having read a paper on this sub­
ject before Sibley College.
Mr. Amsler’s gas producer embodies a number of 
novel features which were conceived by himself 
which enhances the efficiency of the producer and 
which gives a more compact arangement of its ac­
cessories. The producer is especially adapted for an­
thracite coal.
Steam heat and air is sucked through by means of 
a rotary blower attached to the scrubber.
The test will consist in determining its behavior 
when driven hard and its behavior with a varying 
supply of steam. The quantity of gas and dust it pro­
duces will be determined under every condition.

PROPOSED ARRANGEMENT OF NEW BUILDINGS

---------------------------------------------------

6THE TARTAN
THE THEATRE
Last Thursday morning, Mr. Chas. M. Bregg, dra­
matic critic of the Gazette-Times, lectured to the 
students of the Science School on “The Theatre.” 
Mr. Bregg has been interested in this question for 
many years and is without doubt the most capable 
man in Pittsburgh to speak on this subject. The 
substance of his talk was as follows:
In order that a man shall be worthy of that 
name he must have the superstructure of character. 
Since his environment has a great deal to do with 
the development of his character the things that in­
fluence it should be watched closely.
Someone has said: “Let me write the songs of a 
nation and you may make the laws.” What a man 
does in his moments of relaxation has a greater in­
fluence on him than all the laws that were ever 
made. What amuses a man, is a test of his charac­
ter and he may be judged by the way in which he 
employs his spare time.
It is usually said that baseball is our national 
amusement. Strictly speaking, it is not. The the­
atre is our national amusement. Everybody goes to 
the theater tjhese days, especially young people 
whose imagination is stirred by the scenes of the 
stage. The influence of the stage is greater today 
than that of the church or school, as far more peo­
ple go to the former. Mr. Bregg said that one Sun­
day evening “some years ago” he attended a young 
people’s meeting at one of the largest churches in 
the East End. True to his theatrical instinct, he 
“counted the house.” There were 69 young people 
there. The following evening he attended a sensa­
tional melodrama at the Bijou. The house was 
packed and about 3,700 young people were present. 
On account of the widespread influence of the the- . 
atre, it may do great harm, and it is necessary for 
every thinking person to watch it elosely.
In one respect the theater is worse than the sa­
loon, for there are absolutely no laws regulating its 
management. Unscrupulous managers may put any 
vile show on at any theater in Pittsburgh, and un­
less the people protest, it can finish its engagement. 
The most harmful shows are those which are sug­
gestive and every suggestive show is an insult to 
our manhood. In spite of the fact that there was 
some beautiful music in Madame Sherry, the most 
of the play was full of the suggestive and for this 
reason the show was immoral. All such plays should 
be condemned. But as long as the people demand 
shows of this character the theatrical managers will 
continue to produce them. The only way to stamp 
them out is to refuse to go to them, for the most
sensitive part of a box office man is his pocketbook.
How are we to know beforehand whether a show 
is immoral or not? It-is our duty to find out before 
we go and to turn down the bad ones.
On the other hand, the theater is a noble and 
splendid institution. Every one of us is an actor; 
the child with his toys is an actor. The dramatic 
instinct is imaginative and born in us. The theatre 
has the best literature, poetry, music and art of to­
day. We are coming to demand better music at 
least as was shown by the fact that thousands flock­
ed to see “The Chocolate Soldier,” a light opera of 
the better class, during it sengagement here.
The theatre broadens our knowledge and culture. 
It is an institution worth preserving because it 
means refinement. For this reason we should use 
our influence to better the stage by refusing to go 
to those shows which are immoral in nature. Thus 
we may indicate our character and help the commu­
nity and posterity.
Such an appeal coming as it does from a man who 
has won for himself the enviable position that Mr. 
Bregg has, should be heeded. The great sincerity 
with which Mr. Bregg spoke made a deep and last­
ing impression upon his hearers. This lecture was a 
fitting climax to the series which Dean Leete has 
carried on this semester. It is to be hoped that this 
feature will be placed on the schedule for the com­
ing year.
W. & J. BREAKS LOSING STREAK
Carnegie Tech lost a game to Washington and 
Jefferson on Saturday on the latter’s field. Both 
teams played well, but the brunt of the work was 
borne by the pitchers. Moorhead pitched a fine 
game, but his teammates helped the work of Hay­
maker by striking at the bad ones and allowing the 
good ones to pass. This resulted in eleven strike­
outs to the credit of the Red and Black pitcher. The 
hits made by the Plaid were of the healthy variety 
and hard to field. “Tiny” Brine placed a hard one 
just inside the foul line over third base, and 
scampered around the circuit, with Vail ahead, 
while Wilson was searching for the sphere.
The infielders on the Plaid team performed ex­
cellently, in spite of the heat. As usual, Gearhart 
secured the honors in the field, and secured two 
safeties as well. Kirk and Saunders also played 
their positions in a commendable manner, although 
Kirk was responsible for a rather costly error in 
the sixth inning.
For W. & J., Capt Forsythe played the star game, 
followed closely by Haymaker and Marshall. Tib-

The whole trend of this week’s issue spells “Prog­
ress.” First we read of the development of our 
buildings, then of the increase in the number of 
courses offered and finally of the development of 
those courses which we already have. In every 
branch progress, which is due to our Board of Trus­
tees and Faculty.
The year has been one of great success in athlet­
ics. Last fall our cross country team did excellent 
work. This spring has seen the development of the 
best track team Carnegie has ever had. The pros­
pects for the coming year, with the aid of Messrs. 
Marks and Ramsdell are exceedingly bright.
With all these signs of advancement showing 
about him the student should begin to think of his 
own school life and whether it is developing with 
the school; whether his life in relation to the school 
is helping the school in its development or wheth­
er he is leaving this development to others, to the 
trustees, to the faculty or to those few students who 
are really doing things.
In school the student studies those sciences which 
will prepare him for the field he is to enter after 
graduation. In a like manner he should strive after 
a breadth of school life, in preparation for a broad 
life upon leaving school. He should do this for sev­
eral reasons: because the man with the greatest 
breadth of vision can get most cut of life. Because 
the successful man is always a man of breadth of 
vision, and because in leading a broad school life 
he can do good for his school.
The world judges a man by what he does and how 
he does it, as well as by what he knows, The ath-
letic, the social, the studious side of the stunedt’s 
life are of equal importance. He should develop 
all three and be of the greatest good to his Alma 
Mater.
GERMAN CLUB C. M. E. S. AFFAIR
On Saturday evening, June 3rd, the Carnegie Me­
chanical Engineering Society will meet and have 
a social time at the German Club, Craft avenue. 
The affair, to a certain extent, will be on the same 
order as last year, but will have a few additiqnal 
features that will lend added enjoyment. Mr. 
Amsler, who is conducting the tests in Machinery 
Hall, will give a talk on the gas producer. An en­
deavor is being made to have two or three speak­
ers for the evening', who will talk on something 
less serious than thè technical.
It is expected, and to be hoped, that there will 
be a grand turnout of the students, faculty and the 
alumni members, so as to make the affair a real 
success.
Refreshments and smokes will figure strongly in 
the program. Wm. L. Munk, the president of the 
society, is still doing heroic work in connection with 
the collecting of funds for the furnishing of the 
club room at Machinery Hall vand he reports having 
made very great progress.
SENIOR BALL
Everything is in readiness for the Senior Ball 
which takes place on Tuesday, June 6th. Tickets 
are now on sale and can be had from any member 
©f the committee, of which Mr. “Pete” Stirling is 
chairman.
Nivella’s orchestra of six pieces will furnish the 
music.
The refreshment feature of the affair will be very 
good and of a kind which will be in keeping with 
the present warm weather.
The patronesses will include Mrs. Hamerschlag, 
Mrs. McGoodwin, Mrs. Connelly, Mrs. Leete and 
Miss West. Mr. Sterling requests that everybody 
be there on time as he expects to start things on 
time.
G. A. R. MAN SPEAKS
Thursday morning, at the close of the general lec­
ture, Mr. Oliver McClintock, one of the compara­
tively few remaining veterans of the Civil War, 
addressed the students of the Science School. He 
was sent by the local post of the G. A. R. to renew 
and inspire patriotism in our hearts upon the eve of 
Memorial Day. His talk lasted about twenty min­
utes, and during that time he reviewed the principal 
events of the war, the causes leading up to it, the 
hardships and sacrifices of the soldiers and the

THE TARTAN9
PATENTS FOR INVENTIONS
(Continued from last week)
Next we come to inquire how a patent may be ob­
tained, assuming an invention to have been made. A 
patent has often been said to be a contract between 
the inventor on the one hand, and the public on the 
other, as represented by the Government. A man 
who has made an invention has a perfect right to 
keep it locked up in his mind, if he wants to; or pos­
sibly he may practice it secretly, running of course 
some risk of exposure. He is under no obligation 
to disclose it at all, and he may die with it still 
locked up in his own bosom. The purpose of the 
patent law is two-fold. First, to give to the public 
the ultimate benefit of the invention; and second, to 
stimulate invention and to do justice by rewarding, 
so far as it can, the inventor for what he may accom­
plish. Hence the law says to the inventor, if you will 
write out and deposit with the government in Wash­
ington, where it is accessible to the public, a full 
description of your invention, with drawings where 
suuitable, in such full, clear and exact terms that 
anyone skilled in the art, by reading your description 
will understand your invention and be able to prac­
tice it, the Government will, in consideration of your 
doing that, grant you the exclusive right for a "period 
of seventeen years to its practice. After that period 
any member of the public, by reading your specifi­
cations, may freely practice the invention. Hence 
an inventor in applying for his patent is required to 
file with his application a full written description, 
pointing out what he has invented in such full, clear 
and exact terms as to enable anyone skilled in the 
art to practice it.
There is still the second requirement, which is 
equally important. The inventor must also in his 
application point out and ' distinctly claim that in 
which his invention consists, and that which the 
patent is to protect. The purpose of this also is 
manifest. He cannot take a nebulous patent, which 
may be made to cover something and not cover some­
thing else, as exigencies may require. The public 
must know just what his patent covers; that is, must 
know in his inventor’s own words, just what it is for­
bidden to use.
Compliance with these two requirements is essen­
tial to obtaining a patent. The only other essential 
is to be able to convince the Patent Office that the in­
vention is in fact new and consequently entitled to 
protection.
It will thus be readily seen, I think, how import­
ant it is for an inventor, and especially one not fa­
miliar with the forms of patents and the rules of law 
which prevail in enforcing them, to secure skilled 
and conscientious assistance.
The Supreme Court of the United States, in a well- 
known decision, has spoken of the specification of a 
patent as one of the most difficult legal instruments 
there is to draw. The able patent lawyer, no matter
how much he may know of mechanics and applied 
science, must still rely largely upon the inventor to 
inform him of the nature and mode of operation of 
his invention. But that being done, it is equally im­
portant that the skill of the able lawyer be enlisted, 
in order to secure to the inventor what really be­
longs to him. I think 1 may safely say and impress 
upon you in all earnestness, that of the patents 
which out of the vast number granted are held in­
valid or inadequate, when they come before the 
Courts, the very large majority turn out so on ac­
count of mistakes and carelessness of the patentee’s 
attorney, rather than on account of mistakes made 
by the Patent Office.
I am not speaking for the patent lawyer, but for. 
the inventor. There are plenty of good lawyers. 
Find one who commands the confidence of men who 
have considerable patent business, and you will get 
better service than you will from those who are 
merely after business, as a producer of revenue, to 
be gotten in the quickest way possible.
The application, we will note in passing, must be 
made by the inventor himself. He may assign an in­
terest in it, if he likes, but his assignee takes no 
part in making the application. The inventor must 
swear to his application as being the sole inventor, 
if he is such. If two or more have contributed to 
the invention, then it is a joint one, and the two or 
more must swear to the application. In this line I 
have seen unfortunate cases in which parties were 
put to great expense, and in some instances with dis­
astrous results, from inattention to this rule. An 
inventor enlists the help perhaps of one of his friends 
and they file a joint application, when in fact the 
second party had nothing whatever to do with his in­
vention. The second party is merely an assignee 
and not an inventor at all. Inattention to this rule« 
has more than once led to a great deal of trouble.
When the application is received in the Patent 
Office it is forwarded to the appropriate division, and 
comes up in its order for examination. It is the du­
ty of the Examiner to search through prior patents 
and publications in the art to which the invention 
relates, and in kindred and allied arts, in order to 
determine whether the invention as stated in the 
claims of the application is in fact new. It v^ry 
^eldom occurs that a patent is granted without on-« or 
more rejections, and usually several rejections, and 
particularly where the invention is obviously a 
valuable one, the Examiner is particularly care­
ful and acute to make sure that it is duly 
restricted, that is, that the patentee or his attorney, 
in his enthusiasm or from other motives, may not 
claim more than he is entitled to claim. In point of 
fact, it is the experience of all practicing lawyers 
that three times out of four, when a patent is granted 
quickly, it is so narrow or restricted as to be of lit­
tle commercial value.
(To be concluded)

THE TARTAN
TECH DIVIDES UP
The two Decoration Day games at Indiana, Pa., 
resulted in an even split. The Normal team over­
whelmed the Skibo lads in the morning contest by a 
score of 9 to 0, but the Tech boys came back in the 
afternoon and won an interesting eight-inning game 
with a score of 5 to 3. Although the first game 
was the poorest specimen of base ball exhibited by 
the ’Varsity this season, the second was a real 
game.
The feature of the day was the work of Speer, 
who pitched both games for the Normal. He struck 
out a total of sixteen men and gave but two bases 
on balls.
Grotefend pitched his first game for Tech in thé 
morning, and performed rather well. All of the hits 
from his delivery were of the small variety, and many 
might have been prevented by better support.
In the afternoon contest, Urquhart performed on 
the mound in a manner even more than usually 
good. In the first inning, Martin singled, and 
scored on a triple by McCreight, the only long hit 
allowed to the Normals. A sacrifice by Rufïner 
scored McCreight, but the scoring was ended until 
the eighth, when Crane came in after a succession 
of singles. Urquhart also fielded his position ad­
mirably.
Kirk was the hero of the second game, earning 
his reputation by sending a hard drive past Lauffer, 
and .completing the round of the bases before the 
return of the ball. Although the bases were 
empty when Kirk made his home run, the lone run 
gave added confidence to the team and two innings 
later Gearhart and Shenefelt scored by the aid of 
errors on the part of Indiana’s infielders.
Vail and Gearhart were the most active in the 
field, each raising applause by sensational catches of 
flies and generally good work.
All of the Carnegie Tech players performed more 
creditably in the afternoon than in the morning, 
and deserve praise for winning the game.

RESULTS OF TESTS ON FLOOR SLABS OF RE­
INFORCED CINDER CONCRETE
A brief description of these slabs appeared in the 
Tartan some time ago.
The tests were made by loading the slabs with pig 
iron and observing the deflections at constant incre­
ments of load. The pig iron was piled in three tiers, 
each parallel to the I beams carrying the slabs in 
order to reduce the arching effect of the load to a 
minimum. Deflections were obtained at several 
points, these points being located at the center of the 
slab and at the centers and ends of each I beam car­
rying the slab. At these points holes were left in 
the concrete and in these holes were imbedded slen­
der wooden rods carrying scales at the top. By 
means of a level these scales were read to 1-64 of an

inch for increments of 150 pounds per square foot in 
the loading, this unit load being based on the to­
tal area of the slab. The slabs were tested at ages 
varying from 54 to 61 days.
Samples of the 1:2%: 4^ concrete were taken dur­
ing the pouring of the slabs. This concrete when 
tested in the form of cylinders 6 inches in diameter 
and 18 inches high, gave crushing strengths of 631 
pounds per square inch and 785 pounds per square 
inch at 33 days and 56 days respectively.
The slabs were all reinforced with “steelcrete” 
expanded metal made by the Consolidated Expanded 
Metal Companies of this city. In slabs O and Q, 3 
inch number 13 was used; in Slab N, 3 inch number
10 standard; in slab P, 3 inch number 10 light. The 
cross sectional area of metal per foot of width was 
as follows: 3 inch number 13, .083 square inch; 3 
inch number 10 light, .148 square inch; 3 inch number
10 standard, .178 square inch.
In discussing the results, the deflections given are 
those at the center of the slabs, and are referred to 
the points at the center of the I beams carrying 
these deflections being from 2-64 inch to 3-64 inch 
less than if referred to the points at the ends of the 
I beams.
Slabs O and Q, which had the same reinforcement, 
carried a test load of 54,000 pounds, or of 1,500 pound 
per square foot, with deflections of 17-64 inch, and 
20-64 inch, respectively. This test load was allowed 
to remain on slab O for 5 days and the increase in 
deflection was only 1-64 inch. On removing this load 
a permanent set of 1-8 inch was observed.
Slab N, which had the heaviest reinforcement, sup­
ported the same test load with a deflection of 13-64 
inch.
Slab P deflected 30-64 inch under a load of 74,700 
pounds or 2,075 pounds per square foot. When this 
load was increased to 80,000 pounds failure occurred, 
but whether it was caused by the slipping of the tiers 
of pig iron, which were about 12 feet high and quite 
unstable, or by the initial failure of the slab is not 
definitely known. However, the appearance of the 
fracture seemed to indicate the former as the con­
crete had sheared off along a line roughly semi-cir­
cular in shape and extending back from the edge of 
the slab at points about 12 inches inside of the I 
beams, the concrete being uninjured near the shear­
ed surface.
The New York Building Code requires a floor slab 
to carry without failure ten times the working load 
for which it is designed and as these slabs were de­
signed for a working load of 150 pounds per square 
foot or for an ultimate load of 1,500 pounds per 
square foot they possessed this requirement very sat­
isfactorily, for none showed signs of failure at this 
test load. While a few tension cracks usually ap­
peared in the concrete along the center line and 
at the haunches of the slab, in no case were they 
serious.

HOW-DO-YOU-DO TO OUR NEW NEIGH­
BORS AT CAMP CARNEGIE
Last Thursday night the citizens of Freeport, a 
town close to Camp Carnegie, had their first intro­
duction to Tech men when the Musical Clubs gave 
a concert in the local opera house. This concert 
was probably the most hurried of any given during 
the year because the rush of classes, exams, etc., 
made it necessary to hasten back to Pittsburg.
The Musical Clubs take this opportunity to thank 
Miss Agnes Bird, of the administration department, 
and her family f®r their kind interest and support 
tendered at the Natrona and Freeport concerts.
ATHLETIC JOTTINGS
Carnegie Tech, 1914, base ball team lost the sec­
ond of the series to Pittsburg College Reserves on 
Saturday, May 27, by a score of 14 to 4.
Mr. McCulloch notfies the students that their 
gymnasium locker keys will be redeemed at any 
time until the close of school.
Men intending to report for foot ball next fall 
should see Capt. Taylor before leaving for the 
summer. The management is working on arrange­
ments for preliminary practice at the Farm.
NEWS NOTES
The grading work for enlarging the campus, pre­
liminary to the construction of several new build­
ings, was begun last week. The new program for 
extensions calls for an expenditure of about $1,500,- 
000.
Professor Mary Schenck Woolman, head of the 
Domestic Arts department of Teacher’s College, Co­
lumbia University, is to be the commencement guest 
this year of the Faculty and Senior Class of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School for Women.
Visitors of the week include Mr. Albert E. Wells, 
superintendent of shops, Cornell University; Miss 
Leila E. Hunton, head of Domestic Science depart­
ment, Piedmont College, Demarest, Ga.; Mr. J. R. 
Dobyns, president of the board of trustees, Bel- 
haven Collegiate and Industrial Institute, Jackson. 
Miss.; and Mrs. J. C. Bray and Mrs. J. M. Steele of 
the American College of Dressmaking, Kansas City,

This being the final exam, week, the Tartan has 
been issued under difficulties. Yea, verily.
It appears that the Tartan was in error when it 
announced in last week’s issue that James K. 
Lamoree had resigned as secretary of the Booster’s 
Union. Jimmy called at the headquarters and 
lodged a strong protest.
The weather was so hot last week that the Junior 
Mechanicals came to the conclusion that their 
drawing work could be done more comfortably by 
wearing a pair of pants and a smile.
It is unfortunate that the Pittsburg base ball 
team has returned at a time when we are in the 
throes of our finals.
Mr. Critchlow reports that the Bare-headed 
League is making good progress.
The Senior ball is going to be a classy affair.
Tag day was very much observed at these schools 
last week. Mr. Alfred J. Ormston was so fussed 
that he bought 25 tags.
It is to bf* hoped that the Seniors are enjoying 
themselves at Camp Carnegie, and that they are 
getting “that much needed rest.”
According to the calendar this week everybody is 
scheduled to sleep Sunday, June 4th.
The more progressive of the Junior Civils sought 
German services last Sunday.
Many of us have already been compeled to hit 
the ties—beginning early this season.
The other day the head of a boarding school no­
ticed one of the boys wiping his knife on the table­
cloth and pounced on him at once.
“Is that the way you do at home?” he asked, indig­
nantly.
“Oh, no,” answered the boy quickly, “We have 
clean knives at home.”

CARNEGIE CAMP NOTES
Summer instruction in the new course to be given 
in painting, will be conducted each year at the Car­
negie Camp. The landscape is well suited for this 
purpose.
The commencement picnic for the faculty alumni 
and Senior classes on June 7th will be a great affair. 
It is expected that a special train will be needed.
It is a remarkable coincidence that at the camp, 
all of the cows, hens, horses and dog are black and 
white in color. So as to be in harmony with this 
combination of color, Captain Henderson has had 
all of the new trespass signs painted black and 
white.
It is expected that the new telephone line will be 
ready for use in a few days, when, the school? will 
be in direct communication with the camp.
This past week a considerable number of parties 
made use of the camp for outings. They say it is the 
finest of camping places.
TEAMS TO GO TO GROVE CITY
Grove City will be the center of interest for the 
followers of athletics at Carnegie Tech next Sat­
urday. Not only does the base ball team play the 
college nine, but the Intercollegiate Championship 
Meet for Western Pennsylvania will be run off at 
that place.
The chances for winning the base ball game are 
about even, but the track team can reasonably enter­
tain greater hopes. By winning the Pitt Intercol­
legiate meet, the team showed itself superior to any 
other among the local colleges. A greater num­
ber of teams will be entered on Saturday, each 
representing the pick of the athletes of their re­
spective colleges. This presages that the points 
will be divided in such a manner that Tech should 
take the meet. If the conditions are at all favor­
able, a number of records should be broken, and 
our men hope to be among the winners.
