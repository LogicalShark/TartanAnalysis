Four Pittsburgh Artists 
Exhibit In International
Four Pittsburgh artists, one 
of whom is exhibiting for the 
first time in an International, 
are included among the 326 art­
ists listed in the 1967 Pittsburgh 
International which opened Oc­
tober 27.
These artists, all of whom re­
ceived art education at Carnegie- 
Mellon University’s Department 
of Fine Arts, are Samuel Rosen­
berg whose painting is called 
Painting 1967; Russel Twiggs, 
who is exhibiting an oil, Boll 
Call; and Virgil Contini, whose 
Mand and Space sculpture makes 
its debut at the 44th Interna­
tional. Showing in the Interna­
tional for the first time, H. 
Douglas Pickering exhibits 
sculpture entitled Bitual Figure 
With Appropriate Liturgy. He 
is Associate Professor, Depart­
ment of Painting and Sculpture 
at Carnegie-Mellon University.
Mr. Rosenberg has been in­
vited to exhibit 30 pantings in 
20 Internationals since 1920. He 
was exhibited in group show­
ings at the Albright-Knox Art 
Gallery, Buffalo, Corcoran Gal­
lery of Art, New York; Pennsy- 
vania Academy of the Fine Arts, 
Philadelphia; Walker Art Cen­
ter, Minneapolis and the Whit­
ney Museum of American Art, 
New York, among others. Mr. 
Rosenbereg retired lasy winter 
as professor of painting at Car- 
negie-Mellon University.
Russel Twiggs, an early ab­
stract painter, has been includ­
ed in a number of important na­
tional and international shows, 
having exhibited in the Pitts­
burgh International of 1955, 
1958, 1961 and 1964. He has won 
many awards: the National Seri- 
graph First Prize the Heinz 
compeition, Pittsburgh Play­
house, second prize; Interior 
Valley Show, Cincinnati, sec- 
second prize; and here with the 
Associated Artists: the G. David 
Thompson Award, The Rosen- 
bloom Water-color prize, First 
Prize: Carnegie Institute Pur­
chase Award, 1962, and the Jury 
Awards of 1964-1966. Mr. Twiggs 
has exhibited at Grand Central 
Modems, New York; Art Insti­
tute of Chicago, Brooklyn Mus­
eum, Corcoran Gallery of Art, 
Washington; and the Pennsyl­
vania Academy of the Fine Arts, 
Philadelphia, among a number 
of colors.
Virgil Cantini last exhibited 
in the 1964 International. Hs is 
well kown by the crowds which 
throng the annual three Rivers 
Festival, Pittsburgh for his un­
usual innovations. He expresses 
his art point of view thus: “Art 
for me should reflect the hu­
man spirit as it wanders on the 
universe — I work in terms of 
metaphors and symbols to make 
the intangible a reality.” A pro­
fessor of art at the University 
of Pittsburgh, Mr. Cantini won
H. Douglas Pickering’s Ritual 
Figure with Appropriate Liturgy
a Guggenheim grant for travel 
and study abroad in 1957-1958.
In Mr. Pickering's new sculp­
ture completed recently, he 
translates the deign as a new 
machine-evokd approach to God 
and religion, emerging in this* 
changing world of comuter in­
fluence. He was chosen Artist 
of the Year 1966 at the Arts and 
Crafts Center, Pittsburgh, and 
also was a prize winner last 
year in the Associated Artists 
and the Sculpture Society shows.
The International collection of 
paintings and sculpture was se­
lected by the Museum of Art’s 
Director, Gustave von Grosch­
witz during a year’s search in 
the United States and abroad. 
This year’s Sculpture will ex­
tend from October 27 through 
January 7. Daily hours are from 
10:00 a.m. until 9:00 p.m. and 
on Sundays from 2-5 pm.

SF Mime Troup-Committment— 
Involvement-and Fresh Air
Hunt Library will distribute 
the 1967-68 CAMPUS I. D. 
CARDS between the hours of 
9:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. on 
Wednesday and Thursday, 
November 1st and 2nd.
The SF Mime Troupe appear­
ed at C-MU this Sunday and 
Monday, performing their adap­
tation of Goldoni’s L’Amant 
Militaire, in the commedia dell’ 
arte tradition. Attendance was 
less than half of what had been 
expected by the Exprimental 
Film Group, sponsore of the 
event.
L’Amanat Militaire deals with 
a large country (18th century 
Spain) invading a small coun­
try (Italy) to help suppress the 
rebels, who are after land. The 
parallel to the U. S. involvement 
in Vietnam is obvious.
In addition to the two main 
performances the Troupe also 
presented a lecture-demonstra- 
tion before the students and fa­
culty of C-MU’s Drama Depart­
ment. EAGLE F — — —, a

Placement Offers Job Information
Undergraduate and graduate 
students seeking summer or 
full time employment and in­
formation about further study 
find a valuable source in the 
Bureau of Placements, Room 10, 
Skibo.
The Bureau of Placements 
forms a liason betwen the stu­
dents and corporations or oth­
er institutions of higher learn­
ing. Although, it does not pro­
vide jobs, it has contact with 
many potential employers 
across the nation. Under its 
supervision representatives of 
companies and other schools 
are invited to our campus to 
interview interested students.
The interviews last approxi­
mately half an hour. They pro­
vide the students with the op­
portunity to learn more about a 
prospective employer or furth­
er schooling. The visiting rep- 
resntative tries to determine a 
student’s area of interest and 
qualifications for acceptance. If 
the interviewer is favorably im­
pressed, a student may be in­
vited to visit the company or 
school for a better look at what 
they have to offer. Although a 
tour offer indicates an interest 
in the student, he is under no 
obligation if he accepts.
Upon a student’s request, the 
Bureau provides an interviewer 
with student files containing rec­
ommendations, previous job ex­
perience, and other necessary 
information.
The person responsible for 
MMCC interviews the women 
personally to determine their 
immediate interests and long 
range plans for the future, es­
pecially when marriage may in­
terfere with employment after 
graduation.
There are few opportunities 
offered by interviewers to the 
Fine Arts Students. A few 
large companies are looking 
for industrial designers. Arch­
itects, drama students, paint­
ers, sculptors and music stu­dents must make contacts on
lating with a Vietnamese wom­
an, was given. The bulk of the 
program, however, was devoted 
to a political discussion by Ron 
Davis, founder and director of 
the Mime Troupe. Davis is a 
cross between Paul Krassner 
(editor of the Realist) and the 
late Lenny Bruce, and it is his 
ideas that are manifest in the 
Mime Troupe, (although they 
are shared by the other mem­
bers of the Troupe).
The Mime Troupe is a thea­
tre of committment — their 
motto, in fact, is Committ­
ment - Involvement-and Fresh 
Air. Members work for very 
little (somtimes no) pay, and 
perform free in the parks of 
San Francisco.
Davis, a confirmed revolution­
ary, illustrated his talk with 
quotes from Che Guevara and 
Regis Debray (now being held 
prisoner in Bolivia). He rejected 
realism and naturalism in the 
theatre as a waste of time, a 
concept that was hotly contest­
ed by students and faculty. 
Davis also charged that this 
department (and all other drama 
departments) do not adequat- 
ly prepare the student—not in 
terms of technique, but rather, 
in their understanding of and 
involvement in the world, out­
side.* This was also rejected by 
members of the department. A 
drama department faculty mem­
ber pointed out that students 
are given complete freedom 
(limited only by the available 
free time) to participate in any 
activity whatever. But it was 
also suggested that awareness 
of alternative ways of modes be­
havior is a precursor to freedom 
of choice—and that the aware­
ness is often lacking.
This question• and • answer 
period became quite heated, 
with considerable excitement 
and shouting on the part of 
students and faculty. The en­
tire guerilla theatre concept— 
living off the street, inciting 
people to action as primary 
concern of theatre — was re­
jected by many of the depart­
ment members. The Drama 
Department, of course, was not 
prepared to agree that their 
raison d’etre-the preparation 
of actors and technicians for 
professional careers — is bas­
ically wrong.
The Mime Troupe perform­
ance ends with a statement by 
Davis—“This is your system— 
if you don't like it, change it; 
if you can’t change it, destroy 
(Continued on Page 7)
their own, if desired.
In addition to its other ser­
vices, the Bureau of Placements 
provides a copy of the College 
Placement Annual to seniors 
and graduate students. This pub­
lication lists companies alpha­
betically and by geographical 
location. It also gives a brief 
description of the company and 
what it offers.

EDITORIALPass On Pass-FailLETTERS TO THE EDITOR
There has been a disconcerting silence this year concerning 
the pass-fail grading system, about which we all heard so much 
in the spring. (Tartan, May 10 and May 17).
The long hours of planning and research culminated in a 
proposal which was taken up by Dr. Schatz’s Academic Affairs 
Committee. The proposal follows.
1) Pass-fail grades would be used only in minor courses.
2) In an approved pass-fail course, a student may either take 
a grade or be graded pass-fail. He must make his choice on the 
first day of class.
3) All students in the course are graded on the same curve, 
but only a pass or fail is reported to the registrar for pass-fail 
students.
4) Pass-fail courses will count toward graduation but not on 
a student’s Quality Point Average.
5 Any student who takes a pass-fail course must take the con­
sequences if he tries to transfer majors or schools.
We feel that this system of grading is desirable at C-MU. As 
the proposal states, ". . . it would be more possible for students 
to overload minor courses which would broaden their education 
without the student’s factor suffering.” The administration, through 
the Freshman Catalogue, sent to prospective students, press 
releases, etc., attempts to put forward the position that this is a 
place where the student can become involved—can blend his dis­
cipline’s philosophy with that of an entirely different field. How 
is this to be so if an engineer cannot take an art course, and vice 
versa?We would not be the first institution to adopt such a plan on 
an experimental basis. Cal Tech has instituted a pass-fail system 
¡for all freshman courses, resulting in a more relaxed attitude 
among freshmen and a lower dropout rate. Mudd College, the 
University Wisconsin, and Stanford University have all adapted 
some form of pass-fail grading. (The Stanford Observer noted that 
that institution had not had letter grades until 20 years after it 
was founded.) We have been told that our university has a cohe­
sive plan for pass-fail grading under consideration. It went into 
committee and then, we suppose, went the way of all such plans 
into the circulation file.
The student body initiated this plan. It is up to the student 
body to maintain momentum. If Dr. Schatz’s committee is over­
loaded with work, then the Student Senate should appoint a com­
mittee to confront the administration with a request that the sys­
tem be put into effect as soon as possible.
If Dr. Schatz’s committee has considered the proposal, then 
we feel that it is only fair for the matter to be reported out of 
committee, back to the student body where it originated. Other­
wise, it will be impossible for this or any proposals to get past 
the planning stages.
In any event, the Tartan would like to reopen the issue, get 
some student, faculty, and administration opinion on the matter. 
We would like to know what happens to good ideas once they 
enter Warner Hall.
A note to President Stever:
We do not object to letting you have Skibo for an evening, 
but did you have to do it on the night we were going to see Cap­
tain Video VI and two Chiller Theater features? That is going 
too far.

Mellon’s University 
Clear Inconsistency
Editor, the Tartan:
One has little choice but to 
marvel at the inconsistency of 
the policies of Mr. Mellon’s new 
“university.” Two examples may 
at least illustrate this point to 
those who are not unwilling to 
be “unpatriotic.”
First, let’s take a brief look 
at the student noon picnic. That 
is indeed what is occurring in 
the dining room (students’ din­
ing room, that is) of Skibo. Aft­
er all, the “food” is now served 
on paper plates, the coffee in 
paper cups, and a myriad of rare 
delicacies in plastic dishes. Nev­
er fear that you should be serv­
ed any meat of qualitiy! That 
require a metal knife, and only 
plastic utensils are available. 
What is the scene in the adja­
cent staff dining room? A buf­
fet luncheon is served for 75c. 
Of course you shall not see the 
plastic and paper of the picnic, 
but then this is the “staff” din­
ing room. Is a policy which pro­
vides adequate service for the 
staff and a shamble for the stu­
dents consistent? Maybe “dis­
criminatory” is more descrip­
tive. If the student subsidized 
staff facilities are like this, what 
must our sacrifices be doing to 
ensure our faculty a pleasurable 
noon meal?
Secondly, I was appalled to 
learn, directly from one of the 
gentlemen in the Placement Of- 
fce of Mr. Mellon’s university, 
that his office passes a moral 
judgement as to whether a com­
pany should interview Mr. Mel­
lon’s students. He illustrated 
this point by stating that “they” 
would not permit a company 
to visit if they “felt” that the 
hiring practices of the company 
were either discriminatory of 
unethical. Dow Chemical, the 
natnon’s manufacturer of na­
palm and Saran-wrap will be 
permitted to visit Mr. Mellon’s 
university on Nov. 9 to hire his 
students. And what is to follow 
in the ensuing weeks and months 
but our nation’s military re­
cruiters—of course not in Skibo 
but in the vestibule of Baker 
Hall. Is it consistent to morally 
condemn an organization which 
discriminates in their hiring 
and yet accommodate a firm 
manufacturing a product to be 
used for the destruction of a 
civilian popultaion? On visiting 
the same gentleman two days 
later, a fellow student was told 
that Mr. Mellon’s university 
Placement Office makes no such 
judgment! Consistent? No! And 
not only inconsistent, but what 
appears to be a maifestation of 
what is called in less discerning 
circles—a credibility gap.
But I’ve an idea! Since it is 
clear that Mr. Mellon’s univers­
ity has few (if any) consistent 
policies, why not recognize the 
talents of those illustrious ad­
ministrators who make these 
policies? The policies of LBJ’s 
administration are of a similiar 
inconsistency,” so surely he 
could use Mr. Mellon’s univers­
ity as a branch office for fore­
ign policy production. After all, 
there is probobaly no university 
in the world which is more close­
ly allied with the U. S. govern­
ment agencies that Mr. Mellon’s, 
so the result might be the first 
move towards consistency.

Many Thanks Due 
To H.C. Committee
Editor, the Tartan:
I would like to express my 
thanks for the cooperation the 
Homecoming Committee re­
ceived from the Tartan, before, 
during and after the Homecom­
ing Weekend. Without such cov­
erage the weekend could not 
have been such a success.
I would also like to thank Al­
pha Phi Omega for doing their 
usual conscientious, thorough 
job of serving the campus. By 
manning the polls for the Queen 
elections, and serving refresh­
ments at the Saturday evening 
dance. A Phi O provided inval­
uable assistance.
A new feature of the weekend, 
a short review of the feature 
songs from previous Scotch ’n 
Soda productions, was enjoyed 
by most of those in attendance 
at the dance on Saturday eve­
ning of Homecoming.
Finally, I would like to thank 
my committee, for doing such 
a great job in organizing the 
weekend. The work of Erica Bor­
den, Rich Steffens, Bob Albert­
son, Bill Benthall, Jim Jacks, 
John Zavetakis, Randee Rafkin, 
Ruth Steiger, and Laura Seidler 
made my job easy. I would like 
to especially thank my vice- 
chairman, Murray Dickman, for 
working all summer in lining up 
top notch entertainment for the 
weekend, in addition to the in­
numerable hours of work he did 
during the two weeks previous 
to Homecoming.

Foreigners Question 
What America Is
Editor the Tartan:
On October 25, the Tartan 
published one of the most biased 
articles (“Confront the Warmak- 
ers: the Battle of Washington”)
I have seen in this newspaper.
Tens of thousands of people 
flocked to Washington this past 
weekend to demonstrate their 
opposition to the United States 
involvement in the Vietnamese 
War. The students there seemed 
to have a oneness, a homogen- 
ity, and met other students and 
talked on a level of intimacy 
even though they never met be­
fore. 911 were drawn together in 
their common beliefe that this is 
an unjust war. There was a com­
mon feeling of purpose and 
goodness as the people gathered 
at the reflection pool and walk­
ed across the Memorial Bridge 
to the Pentagon to “Confront 
the Warmakers.” There was no 
“wars of nerves and endurance” 
as the Tartan indicates.
However, at very infrequent 
intervals, women and men lit­
erally beaten in a sitting position 
were dragged away. Their civil 
rights in your country’s capital 
disregarded, they were deprived
lawyers counsel, and the names, 
and places of detention of the ^ 
arrested were withheld. Others 
were tear gassed by Federal 
Troops as thousands of onlook­
ers witnessed. If the Pentagon 
can do this, it is no wonder 
many Americans can no longer 
accept what the government 
calls truth. It makes one ask, 
as many foreigners her and 
abroad have repeatedly ask ^ 
over the last few years, “can 
this really be America?”

Only One Solution 
To Vietnam War
Editor, the Tartan: *
What with the peace demon- 
trations of the past couple of 
weeks both here and in Wash­
ington and with various and ! 
sundry student groups protest­
ing the war in Vietnam, I be 
lieve I’ve arrived at a viable so­
lution to the problem.
First, let me state the proiJf 
lem as I see it. It is, I believe, 
warfl What all these people and 
groups fear is war and its con­
sequences. As a result, of course, 
since this is only a two-sided 
coin, they want peace, but I 
think their primary motivation 
is a fear of war. War wastry 
lives, thousands of soldiers and 
civilians have been killed and 
are being killed in every mili­
tary action. And, of course, no 
one wants to die. War also des^ 
troys, and with today’s nuclear 
technology, such destruction 
would be absolute. Civilization 
as we know it would no longe*' 
exist. Our culture and all of its 
artifacts, its works of art, its 
history, woul dbe vaporized in 
the atomic mushroom. Survival 
itself would be threatened. War 
is horrible, it is also hell: we 
are right to fear it.
Thus I say my solution is vi­
able. If put into effect, it if# 
guaranteed to end war within 
two years at the utmost. If used 
it will create a unified world gov­
ernment of people and nations 
with the same goals, working 
together for the common good 
of all. There will be no draft; 
there will be no wars; there 
will be no more killing of inno­
cent civilians; there will be no^ 
threat to our civilization and . 
our culture. There will be peace, 
and probably brotherhood; there 
will be advancement. With no 
war, the 50 per cent of our bud­
get used for offense and defense 
could be channeled into medical 
and scientific research that will 
benefit the world and enable us 
to achieve all that man is capa- V 
ble of. With the pressures and 
fear of war removed, art could 
flourish, and our culture not 
only saved but raised to heights 
undreamed of. The solution?
Let’s go Communist.
Let us take the first step and 
offer ourselves to Brezhnev and 
Mao, thus ending this strife be- h 
tween the opposing camps and 
brining about that peace which 
we all so desperately want.
Sincerely, 
Vance L. Rutan

At 9:45 P.M. EST on February 27, a Pan-American Boeing 727 jetliner 
with 98 passengers on board made a fully automatic landing at John 
F. Kennedy Airport in New York — the first operational automatic 
landing in the history of aviation in the United States.
Sperry Flight Systems Division participated as a member of the 
Boeing-Sperry engineering team which made this event possible. Our 
SP-50 Automatic Flight Control System played a key role. It put the 
Boeing 727 down “smooth as a feather." less than four feet to the 
right of the runway's center line under conditions of snow and fog — 
with a crosswind of twelve knots.
This is just another reason why Sperry Flight Systems Division is 
recognized as the leader in the development of Flight Control Sys­
tems and Flight Instruments and Displays. Our engineering team is 
second to none.

CFP Takes Steps To Alleviate Problem
During the past few semes­
ters the fraternity systm has 
ben experiencing a parking 
problem due to the shortage of 
parking spaces within the fra­
ternity parking areas.
There are two reasons for 
this present shortage of parking 
spaces, here has been a steady 
increase in the number of cars 
within the fraternity system and 
there are many car owners, who 
are non-fraternity men, parking 
their vehicle in fraternity park­
ing areas.
The Council of Fraternity

On Being a People-Lover
by
George Havach, S. J.
“I turn on with people.”
It is generally considered to 
be a mark in a person’s favor 
if he lays claim to a warm in­
terest in other people. After all, 
doesn’t this point to a certain 
social maturity, a healthy out­
goingness, a desire to work for 
others? Since social-mindedness 
and social adjustment find their 
place in the popular hierarchy 
of values projected by the adult 
world, they recur in the conven­
tionalized judgements made in 
day-to-day life. As Johnny pro­
ceeds through grade school, his 
teachers note his “peer-group re­
lationships," his circle of friends, 
his degree of awkwardness or 
ease before the class. When 
Johnny starts speaking for him­
self and making his own decisi­
ons, he may well be condition­
ed to express his general social 
attitude by saying, “I like peo­
ple.”
All this is fine and good; con­
ditioning of this sort may well 
give a preferred direction to de­
velopment of individual atti­
tudes among a large number of 
persons, so as to insure a com­
mon awareness of an area of 
value. In this way smooth so­
cial functioning and individual 
acceptance are promoted. None­
theless, a wide spectrum of in­
tensity of awareness on such a 
point as "interest in others” is 
met with in any group of so­
cially well-adjusted individuals. 
There are people eager to be 
of help to others, and people 
who manipulate others for their 
own advantage, “people who 
need people,” and loners; there 
are those who, like Charlie 
Brown, need all th friends they 
can get, and those who spend 
Saturday nights studying. Why 
such wide variance in one well- 
conditioned attitude?
The significant feature of any 
attitude is that it very often 
is creatively embodied in an in­
dividual as a result of a process 
of personal insight — in short, 
an attitude is chosen because 
it becomes personnally meaning­
ful. But insight and meaning 
spring from experience, and ex­
perience stir a heightening of 
personal awareness. Why do I 
say, “I like people”? Because 
I see them as something special. 
How are they special? Well . . . 
And now we must organize and 
verbalize the insight we claim 
through the pattern of personal 
experience which has been so 
enlightning; to be able to theor­
ize upon our experience in this 
way follows precisely on our 
creativity in exercising this atti­
tude we have taken on.
This process of insight into 
other-people-as-value is an un­
usually remarkable instance of a 
general depening of outlook in 
specific areas that inevitably 
comes as a person is free to “ex­
perience things for himeself.” 
The social fact is ever-present, 
perhaps at times oppressive; 
how one responds to other peo­
ple (i.e. the attitude one takes 
toward them) is a function of 
the quality of the insight one 
receives from social experiences. 
What personal insight lies at 
the root of a creative “I like 
people”-attitude?
What seems to occur is a
flash of light into the somewhat 
murky area of “other people,” 
of the self among selves, of the 
awamess of individual existence. 
One formation of this “flash” 
could take the form, “People are 
not just objects in my envi­
ronment like trees annd houses 
and tables and chairs; they are 
persons. They responded to me 
touch me inn a way no chair or 
table can; their presence calls 
for a richer repsonse from me 
as well. Our effect on one anoth­
er is conscious, purposeful, and 
colored by spontaneity. Persons 
seem more important than any­
thing else in the world.”
To have such an insight, which 
is always flavored by a unique­
ness of personal experience and 
hnnce of the expressive terms 
employd, is to have made an 
initial breakthrough innto what 
may be called a new “way to 
be.” The view of the world of 
other people as trannsmitted by 
cultural conditioning is trans­
formed by the discovery that 
each individual is himself a 
world, a center of consciousness 
for the World around him, and 
thereby unique and, in his own 
way, irreplaceable. This insight 
is followed by a new succession 
of discoveries that can often be 
breathtaking. This path is taken 
when none begins to appre­
ciate, judge, and interact with 
people from the inside out; one 
sees oneself as a person among 
persons and social life as in­
volving a new richness of act­
ivity. The on going process in 
the human family is one of “peo- 
pleification”; we actively create 
one another as persons. The 
heightened awareness of the 
person-values operative in any 
human situation whatsoever is 
a consequence of this insight; 
it characterizes one as a “peo- 
ple-lover ”
The people-lover’s at first in­
distinctly perceived insight un­
dergoes a progressive deepening 
and refining through his newly 
acquired sensitivity in the midst 
of his experiences of social life. 
The acute joys of personal 
interchange, of friendship, of in­
terest in and concern for others, 
are set in relief by the frustra­
tions of personal isolation of an­
tagonism, of disregard for per­
sonal values in himself and 
others—“the World as it is.”

Student Club 
Opens Downtown
Monday, November 6 at 9 pm 
will mark the opening of a 
gathering place exclusively for 
Pittsburgh’s post - high school 
students. Known as the Pitts­
burgh Student Club, it is being 
sponsord by the YMCA of Pitts­
burgh in response to expressions 
of interest by students and ad­
ministrators at least 10 kegree 
granting and non-degree grant­
ing downtown schools. On Tues­
day, November 7 the Club will 
begin its regular Monday 
through Friday hours of 3 pm 
to midnight. The Club will have 
quarters at the Golden Triangle 
YMCA at 3rd and Wood, with a 
separate 3rd Street entrance. 
Featured at the opening will be 
a local student band and a show 
of experimental films.
Admission to the Club will be 
without charge through Novem­
ber upon presentation of a 
school or college identification 
card. Beginning December, mem­
berships, which will be avail­
able during November, will be 
quired although there will be 
provisions for guests. Any cur­
rent YMCA membership will be 
applicable toward Club mem­
bership.
Virginia Wall, student at Point 
Park College, and James Mc­
Mahan, student at West Penn 
Technical Institute, head the 
committee responsible for the 
Club’s operation. While dances

it.” The Mime Troupe offers 
concrete ways to change the 
system — if you don’t believe 
in the war, don’t go. Bomb the 
draft board, or the induction 
center. But don’t go.
It is interesting that the Mime 
Troupe has recently been pre­
ceding the recruiting teams of 
the Dow Chemical Company by 
a few days; Davis mentions the 
Dow problem at the end of the 
performance (Dow is a primary 
manufacturer of Napalm, and 
riots have occurred at some 
campuses to prevent Dow re­
cruiting tams from interviewing 
prospective employees). ro- 
test demonstration is scheduled 
at Tech for November 9, the 
day of Dow, and may include a 
showing of the film NAPALM, 
about the manufacture and use 
of the deadly material.
The Mime Troupe tour con­
tinues to New York and Boston, 
with some intermediate stops; 
the current Troupe will return 
to San Francisco in late Novem­
ber, and begin working on its 
summer performance.
The Experimental Film Group 
plans to bring in future groups 
of this type. An attempt will be 
mad to schedule an a perfor­
mance by El Teatro Campesino, 
a guerilla troupe made up of 
grape pickers from California.

N.U. Heads Bill Of Undergrounds
A special program of Under­
ground Films by several of the 
world’s outstanding film direc­
tors will be presented Monday, 
November 6, in the Skibo Ball­
room at C-MU. Heading the bill 
will be Michaelangelo Antoni­
oni’s first important film, N. U. 
Antonioni, creator of Blow Up, 
L’Aventura, and La Notte, and 
Italy’s leading avant-grade film 
director, won his first great cri­
tical acclaim with N. U., and 
calls it the most significant 
milestone in his career.
Co-featured will be Alain Res­
nais’ most noteworthy short 
film, Guernica. Resnais, director 
of Last Year at Marienbad and 
Hiroshima Mon Amour, is rec­
ognized as the first great film 
director of the New Wave, and 
in Guernica, his early style is 
clearly exemplified. This study 
of Picasso’s masterpiere on the 
horrors of war featurs the fam­
ous actress Eva LeGalliene, and 
was winner of the Robert Fla­
herty Award.
Kenneth Anger, America’s 
leading avant-garde and Under­
ground Film-maker, will be rep- 
sented by Kustom Kar Komman- 
dos. In this film, Anger, creator 
of Scorpio Rising, continues his 
study of the sexual fanaticism 
of the American Male. Also to 
be shown is The Blood of the 
Beasts, George Franju’s classic 
study of the Paris slaughter 
house, winner of the Grand Prix 
at Cannes. Several other films 
will be shown, including L’Opera 
Mouffe, by Agnes Varda, direc­
tor of Cleo from 5 to 7.
Screenings will be at 4:30 7:00, 
9:00 and 11:00, in the Skibo 
Ballroom at CMU. Admission is 
75c. It is advised that those who 
to be assured of tickets arrive 
at least 15 minutes early, as 
seating is limited.

I. M. REVIEW
Packers League
Gsia defeated AO by a score 
of 28-27. The GSIA quarterback 
engineered numerous drives for 
touchdowns while the defense 
virtually stopped the powereful 
ATO running game and put 
constant pressure on their quar­
terback in the first half. The 
score at the half was GSIA 16, 
ATO 6 but ATO’s rally in the 
second half just fell short.

SAE sought to revenge losses 
to BTP from the last two years 
but BTP refused to change the 
script. The first two touchdowns 
for BTP resulted from a quar­
terback keeper around left end 
by Zabetakis and a long touch­
down pass. SAE countered with 
a touchdown from Pottmeyer to 
Malizia then a 25-yard touch­
down jaunt by Pottmeyer. BTP 
moved downfield in the final 
period in an attempt to wrap 
up the game when a clutch SAE 
interception in the end zone 
halted that drive giving SAE an 
opportunity to forge ahead. But 
an alert BTP defender picked 
off a pass and Zabettakis car­
ried around right end to seal
the outcome of the game in
BTP’s favor.

The EJ’s gained sole posses­
sion of first place, while drop­
ping PKA into a tie for second 
place with TDP and the Met 
Nights. TDP had to beat PKT 
in their final game to enter this 
tie and they displayed their 
credentials in an overwhelming 
85-24 victory. Meeting tougher 
opponents in PKA in the playoff 
for second place, TDP led by 
Quarterback Lazarus’s seven 
touchdown passes, walked away 
with another one, this time by a 
45-9 score. After scoring 110 
points in two games, the fired 
up TDP squad ha dto face the 
Met Knights for their third 
game this week. The Met 
Knights won the right to play 
BTP by handing TDP a heart­
breaking 24-21 defeat with a 
(Continued on Page 9)
Tartans were credited with a 
minus one rushing total in 32 
attempts but several long losses 
by the quarterbacks kept the 
total down. There were 22 penal­
ties called, 11 against ach squad, 
for a total of 259 yards. Thiel 
has lost one game, an opening 
day defeat to Westminster, 
whom the Tartans face next 
Saturday at Westminster.
Camegie-Mellon University finds itself in quite a predicament 
athletically: during the 1966-67 season every varsity athletic team 
managed to have a .500 or better record, and the new university 
must try to equal or improve this record. The cross-country team, 
although disabled by losses from graduation and illness, has 
managed to keep its record on the winning side so far this season. 
The C-MU gridiron squad, now 2-4, cannot match last year’s rec­
ord and will be hard-pressed to win both remaining games to even 
up the wins with the losses. The rifle team is off to a fair start, 
winning two of its first three meets, and a group of gentlemen 
unofficially representing C-MU in soccer won a game against 
Point Park College last Saturday, 3-2. Overall, these teams are 
performing well, but not nearly as well (in most oases) as the 
same teams last year. Such will also be the situation with the 
basketball squad, which started practice three weeks ago.
With the loss of Don Keefer (who was given the “outstanding 
senior man” award by alumni at Homecoming), Jeff Kalin, and 
Ray Burdett (both now helping to coach the C-MU frosh), the 
squad finds itself without three of the four big guns of last year’s 
team. Mark Lang, 5’5” junior (from anywhere except Pittsburgh), 
was the top scorer last year with a 15.2 average, giving him 592 
career points and a good shot at breaking Jeff Kalin’s total of
1,194 (Kalin had 506 after two years). Neil Houser, who started 
for C-MU until late in the season as a guard, must contend with 
John Medster, Leigh DeHuff (Houser’s replacement and a starter 
late last season) and the fact that against teams with plenty of 
height there may only be two guards in the game at any one 
time. In the backcourt, Lang and Barry Hummel, a 6’3” junior, 
will most probably start, with sophomers Bill Weborg and Bob 
Grazzini filling in when needed.
Last Friday this reporter witnessed part of a scrimmage with 
Point Bark, coached by former CIT basketball coach Mel Cratsley. 
Lang, Nummel, Meister, DeHuff, and Houster started, and built 
up a quick edge of somewhere near a dozen points (few fouls, 
and Grazzini along with Dave Stobbe on the inside, and Fletcher 
Hardiman, Snow Mitchell, Dick Eckhardt, Don Jablionowski, and 
Ken Petrosky on the outside. These men will probably form the 
first C-MU basketball team.
Although the team is not deficient in height, strength, or over­
all playing ability, it lacks the precise shooting that marked the 
last two Carnegie roundbal'l squads. Only supreme hustling on 
the part of the outside men, who must control the moves of the 
team, and rappant desire under the boards will enaible Fassinger’s 
team to equal last year’s 12-11 record.* * * *
SHORTS: The Athletic Department is looking for varsity 
managers for all sports. This is an excellent opportunity to travel 
with the team and see the action in person. Drop by the Athletic 
Office, Room No. 103, in the Gym, if interested.
Correction: In the C-MU ‘Date Book,” the Westminster game 
on Feb. 5, 1968, should read “Home,” instead of “Away.”
The TARTAN Sports Staff needs writers for intramural and 
some varsity sports. Call me at 683-2076 or drop a line in Skibo 50

Thiel Throws CMU: 42-14
dG IL ZFCdF.
A stingy forward wall and a tough defensive secon­
dary greeted the C-MU footbal team. When they traveled 
to Th iel last Saturday. Along with a better than usual pass­
ing attack, the Tomcats proved to be muchfor the Tartans 
as they rolled to a 42-12 win. The Tartans looked equal to 
the task however, in the first quarter when they jumped 
off to a 6-0 lead and held Thiel in check until the closing
mnutes of the quarter. -----------------------------------------------——
Thiel Throws C-MU 52-14 gained two yards on an ex-
The Tartans kicked off to 
open the contest and for awhile 
neither team could mount a 
real threat. Thiel’s initial drive 
was stopped at midfield, follow­
ed by several exchanges of 
punts. The Tomcats finally 
theatened when Ghetto’s punt 
was returned to the C-MU 38 
but Gene Giarnelli rcovered a 
fumble on the 33 to stop the 
drive. Rich Bell then caught a 
beautiful Tom Hubka pass on 
the Thiel 20 and raced in for 
the TD. he extra point attempt 
was not good, making the score
6-0.
Thiel was called for holding 
on the next kick and took pos­
session on their own 17. Quar­
terback Tom Phillips took to the 
air and moved the team down 
to the 27 of Carnegie. There he 
hit John Gibson for the third 
time and a touchdown. Apple- 
town converted and Thiel took 
a 7-6 lead that they nevr relin­
quished. On the ensuing drive 
a pass interference call put the 
ball on Thiel’s 32. Hubka hit 
Batorski at the 24, but an in­
complete fourth down pass stop­
ped the threat. Gibson circled

the end all the way to the Tar­
tan 42 before he was tackld as 
the quarter ended. Thiel wast­
ed no time getting on the score­
board in the scond quarter. 
From the 42 they moved to the
13 on several running plays and 
Phillips difference was now 14- 
6.
The kick-off reached the end 
zone and The Tartans took over 
on their 20. Hubka began con­
necting with his receivers after 
Charlie Zak ran to the 32 for a 
first down. Completions to Tony 
Bugel and Batorski put the ball 
on the 34 of Thiel. A screen to 
Joe Cherny and a dive by Ghet­
to resulted in a first down but 
a strong blitz enabled Thiel to 
drop Hubka for an 11 yard loss. 
Jim Baird intercepted a pass to 
stop the drive and ran it back 
to the C-MU 42. After Thiel
change of punts a reverse was 
called and George Green scam- 
perd 40 yards for another score. 
The half ende dwith Thiel on top 
20-6.
Tech received to open the sec­
ond half but lost possssion at 
the first of five interceptions. 
The Tomcats quickkly scored 
again when Gibson caught his 
third touchdown pass after the 
ball had been moved to the 8. 
A good conversion made the 
score 27-6. Once again Thiel pil­
fered another pass and drove 
clos to the Tartan goal. This 
time, though, they were stop­
ped as a 36 yard field goal at­
tempt was wide.
Whn Tom Hubka, suffering 
from an injured leg and an es­
pecially strong rush, lost his 
temper and was ejected from 
the game for punching a Thiel 
lineman, Kevin Wilson took 
over. A Tech punt was retum- 
nd to the 36 and reserve quar­
terback Muckle led Thiel to 
another score to make the dif- 
femce 34-6. The fourth quarter 
opend with Tech taking pos- 
ession on their 26 after a punt 
by Thiel. An interception was 
called back and a first down 
was obtained on the 42. From 
there Wilson hit Zak to move 
the. ball to the opposing 40, fol­
lowed by a 12 yard pass to Bu­
gel. Thiel intercepted again on 
the 22 but th Tartans got the 
ball back on a fumble recovery. 
Bugel caught another Wilson 
toss on the 6 and Ghetto took 
a hand-off in for the TD. Bell 
caught a pass for the two point 
conversion to make the score 
35-14. Interceptions by Cherney 
and Helhowski ended two Thiel 
drives later in the period but 
the Tartans were unable to 
score. They finally drove to the
12. When defensive tackle Jim 
Yoho batted a Wilson toss into 
the air, grabbed it and grum­
bled 82 yards for a touchdown. 
The scoring in the game ended 
with a successful two point con­
version to make it 42-14.
Hubka threw three intercep­
tions, but that can’t take away 
he fac that he did a good job 
connecting on 17 of 28 passes 
against an excellent secondary 
and a strong rush. (Thiel has 
now picked off 18 opposition 
passes in only five games.) The

RifleTeam Loses 
Record Now 2-1
by Jon Arnold
The C-MU Rifle Team suffer­
ed its first loss Saturday, at 
Allegheny. This was the first 
loss of the season for the Tar­
tan shooters, giving them a 2-1 
record.
The absence of MVP Ted 
Mankovich was sorely felt, but 
sophomore Steve Roth shot an 
amazing 264 to be high Tartan 
scorer for the match. He was 
followed by O’Donnell, 252, Ar­
nold, 251, Boynton, 249, and San- 
dgren, 246, for a team total of 
1261.
Allegheny’s high scorer, 
Fields, had a 270 for the match 
high, and a team total of 1275.
In the other two matches the 
Tartans beat St. Francis 1373- 
1270, and Geneva 1225-1200.
A club is led to the kind and a diamond is played. East can 
trump whenever he wishes, but South can overtrump, draw the 
last trump and claim the balance.
South must reducc his trump length to two, or he will be 
forced to ruff in his hand at trick 11 while East discards. Then 
South will have to lead from his queen-ten of trumps and give 
East the setting trick. This sort of play is sometimes referred to 
as a coup-coup.

The EJ’s and SAE were hook­
ed up in an exciting seesaw 
battle in their quarter final 
match. The varied passing at­
tack of the EJ’s kept pace with 
the strong running and passing 
established by SAE until Tay­
lor blocked an EJ punt and pick­
ed up the loose ball to score 
a touchdown and give SAE the 
lead. The EJ’s then came with­
in a yard of victory as they 
moved downfield with less than 
one minute left but an alert 
SAE defender intercepted a 
Pass enabling his team to run 
out the clock.
A powerful GSIA squad met 
suprisingly strong opposition 
from an aggresive SN six. The 
grads managed to carry a 21-10 
lead into the final period but 
SN came back with a touchdown 
and two first downs to narrow 
the deficit to four points. Their 
defense held GSIA and SN seem­
ed heading for an upset, but 
their rally ended when a long 
fourth dow npass was incom­
plete.

The trump coup is designed to pickk up an opponent’s trump 
when a finesse is not available. South, declarer in six spades (even 
though six no trump is a far better contract), must not lose a 
spade trick. West cashes his ace of club and switches to the heart 
queen. South wins in his hand and cashes the act and kind of 
spades. East is revealed to have the jack-nine of trumps in front 
of the queen-ten, but there are no spades left with which to finesse. 
South must first reduce his trumps to the same length as East’s, 
namely two. To accomplish this he cashes the king of hearts, 
ruffs a heart, cashes the act and kind of diamonds and ruffs a 
diamond, leaving the position:

Harriers Extend Streak 
To Seven Straight Meets
dG ZFP 1YHE
YPL UYEEG 9PLHEXFP
The Tartans ran their victory streak to seven straight 
in dual meets last week as they defeated Indiana Univers­
ity (28-29), Westminster (25-32), and St. Vincent (19-44) 
the latter pair in a dual meet last Saturday at Westminstei 
College. The victories brought the Harriers record t«. six 
wins and two losses in dual meets, and also a first place 
finish at the Davis-Elkins Festival meet.
Against Indiana the C-MU 
runners won their closest meet 
of the season, with the depth 
of the Tartan squad proving to 
be the winning margin. Two 
runners from the visiting team 
took the first two places, with 
John Butler and Bemie Flynn 
and another Indiana man round­
ing out the first five. Don Baer, 
Cary Scarborough, and Dale 
Peschel were followed by an 
Indiana runner, who in turn 
was followed by Lorhan and 
Bullers from C-MU. The fifth 
visitor came in twelfth. Had he 
beaten both Lorhan and Bullers, 
Indiana would have won the 
meet. But as it stood, these two 
C-MU harriers proved to be the 
winning difference. The score 
again; C-MU 28; Indiana 29.
In the dual meet at Westmins­
ter Tom Gregory of the host 
school finished first with a siz­
zling time of 24:17 for the 4.6 
mile course. Flynn, Baer, But­
ler, Peschel, Scarborough, and 
Bullers were the top finishers 
for the Tartans, who handily
