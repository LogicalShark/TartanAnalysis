Tech ?rm donates $35 million, seeks student recognition
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
The university announced 
a $35 million donation ear-
lier this week from Tata Con-
sultancy Services (TCS), the 
?fth-largest donation in the 
university’s history and one of 
a string of recent gifts.
TCS is a worldwide tech-
nology services and consult-
ing company, operating in 
46 countries and generating 
billions of dollars in revenue. 
TCS is a household name in In-
dia, where it is headquartered, 
and has a growing brand 
both in the United States and 
worldwide. TCS is among the 
largest Indian corporations, 
as measured by its $80 billion 
market capitalization, and is 
the largest Indian IT company.
Natarajan Chandrasek-
aran, CEO and managing di-
rector of TCS, hopes that the 
donation and ensuing part-
nership between the compa-
ny and Carnegie Mellon will 
make TCS well-known to col-
lege students at Carnegie Mel-
lon and across the country. “In 
the future we’re looking to see 
some CMU graduates and un-
dergraduates joining TCS as 
the place to be,” Chandrasek-
aran said. “Because we’re go-
ing to be focusing on creating 
a future which will solve not 
only industry problems, but 
create great breakthroughs in 
solving some of the societal 
problems.”
The donation was 
announced on Tuesday by 
a campus-wide email from 
University President Subra 
Suresh, along with a panel dis-
cussion and meeting of mem-
bers of the Innovators’ Forum. 
According to the email, “The

Over the summer, Student 
Senate’s Academic Affairs 
Committee, the Of?ce of Stu-
dent Affairs, and Dining Ser-
vices came together to forge 
bonds between the students 
and professors of Carnegie 
Mellon with a new initiative. 
The program, called Fac-
ulty Student Lunch, will be 
piloted throughout the fall 
semester.
Proposed by se-
nior information 
systems major 
Evan Wineland 
and sophomore 
computer sci-
ence major Eric 
Zhu, the program aims to 
strengthen relationships be-
tween the faculty and student 
body. 
Zhu serves as the chair of 
the Academic Affairs Commit-
tee for Senate, and from that 
post, he and Wineland have 
coordinated with Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno 
and Vice Provost Amy Burkert 
to make the program a reality. 
Through the program, 825 
students will have the oppor-
tunity to get a free lunch 
at the Schatz Dining 
Room between 
11:30 a.m. and 2 
p.m. with a fac-
ulty member of 
their choice.
“This pro-
gram will 
provide 
a struc-
tured en-
try point 
to help 
students make a connection 
with a faculty member who 
has opted in to the program,” 
Casalegno wrote in an email 
to The Tartan. 
“Developing relationships 
with faculty outside the class-
room can further students’ 
educational goals through op-
portunities like undergradu-
ate research, doing commu-
nity outreach and service, or 
developing one’s plans for 
graduate study or ca-
reer after CMU.”
Similar 
programs 
exist at 
many of 
Carnegie 
Mellon’s 
peer in-
stitutions, 
including 
Princeton 
University, Dart-
mouth University, 
and the University 
of Pennsylvania, according to 
Zhu. 
He said that compared to 
the students at these univer-
sities and colleges, students 
at Carnegie Mellon tend to be 
less connected to the profes-
sors, often notable research-
ers in their respective ?elds. 
“These relationships aren’t 
built during of?ce hours, 
which are used at CMU for 
getting extra learning and 
problem sets in. Students are 
missing out until junior and 
senior year, when they ?-
nally talk to professors 
outside of class,” Zhu 
said.

of the program is to

The United States Depart-
ment of Defense renewed its 
contract with the Carnegie 
Mellon Software Engineering 
Institute (SEI) this summer 
for $1.73 billion. This is over 
twice the value of the previous 
contract agreement the SEI 
made with the government 
over ?ve years ago.
As per the school’s part 
of the agreement, the SEI 
will provide crucial services 
to the United States govern-
ment. The institute will re-
search ways to increase the 
reliability and security of 
government software systems. 
Paul Nielsen, SEI CEO, said in 
a university press release that 
“Our new contract guarantees 
that the SEI can continue to 
develop breakthrough tech-
nologies in collaboration with 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
the Department of Defense, 
and our industry partners.” 
This contract renewal may 
come as a relief, as the past few 
years, Carnegie Mellon has 
experienced problems with 
funding. “Like many colleges 
and universities, we faced the 
government shutdown, de-
creasing federal funding due 
to the sequestration and rising 
costs associated with growth 
and expansion,” Chief Finan-
cial Of?cer Amir Rahnamay-
Azar said in his 2014 ?scal 
report for the university. Azar 
continued by noting that even 
bringing in more talented in-
dividuals has become a chal-
lenge, as the current higher 
education hiring climate is 
extremely competitive.
Last year’s ?scal shortages 
motivated University Presi-
dent Dr. Subra Suresh to raise 
money for the university, in-
cluding by way of government 
contracts. In addition to these 
contracts, among which is a 
small one with the Federal 
New faculty lunch program createdCMU researchers at NREC leave for future at Uber
BRIAN WALSH

For Uber, a company that 
has become a household 
name in the U.S., growth is 
naturally in its sights, and has 
been since the company’s in-
ception.
Earlier this year, Uber 
teamed up with Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Depart-
ment. Autonomous vehicles 
are the talk of the future of 
transportation, and Carnegie 
Mellon is a leader in research 
on robotics and self-driving 
cars. 
As Uber continues to grow, 
not only allowing consum-
ers nationwide to use their 
service, but also expanding 
to countries like Mexico and 
Greece, drivers are in high 
demand. These drivers, how-
ever, put a heavy burden on 
Uber’s bottom line. It made 
sense, therefore, for Uber to 
invest in a future with self-
driving cars.
Behind the scenes, the 
agreement was rife with ten-
sion and confusion from the 
start. The National Robotics 
Engineering Center (NREC) 
is used to their funding com-
ing from corporate and gov-
ernment donations, and the 
Uber agreement caused con-
fusion, as much of the boost 
in funding for autonomous 
research was to come from 
the school’s pocket.
To add to the confusion, 
the standards were ambigu-
ously set for intellectual 
property. Now Uber is setting 
up facilities in Pittsburgh and 
has hired 40 staff members 
from NREC, bringing intel-
lectual property, contracts, 
and funds in house. 
It is apparent as well that 
the move of these employ-
ees was in the talks prior to 
the announcement of Uber’s 
partnership with NREC on 
Feb. 2.           
Carnegie Mellon’s fa-
cilities are not purged, so to 
speak. The NREC still has 
contracts from the Depart-
ment of Defense, the De-
partment of Transportation, 
and several private donors. 
Additionally, the NREC has 
been very involved with the 
DARPA challenges, autono-
mous vehicle races sponsored 
by the U.S. government, and 
approved by congress.
Secretary of Transporta-
tion Anthony Foxx visited the 
NREC last spring to discuss 
with students and research-
ers the viability of autono-
mous vehicles in the future. 
Foxx interacted in a 
round table discussion with 
students.

Carnegie Mellon’s Simon 
Initiative, focused on educa-
tion research and the science 
behind learning, recently 
hired learning engineer Kim-
berly Law. Law’s position is 
supported by a two-year, $1 
million grant from the Carne-
gie Corporation of New York. 
The Simon Initiative 
hopes to overcome some of 
the dif?culties presented by 
technology-enhanced learn-
ing (TEL). 
Law’s role will be to de-
velop new TEL courses in 
statistics in computer sci-
ence, drawing on a back-
ground at the National STEM 
Consortium. 
Law’s work will rely on 
Open Learning Initiative 
(OLI) resources and a team-
based, scienti?c approach to 
higher education.
“Kim brings a wealth of 
experience in improving 
technology education,” said 
Norman Bier, OLI director 
and executive director of the 
Simon Initiative, in a uni-
versity news release. “Her 
experience, along with key 
collaboration with faculty, 
will allow us to appropriately 
determine how to overcome 
typical obstacles to TEL adop-
tion, which is the ?rst, cru-
cial step in making this work 
more broadly available.”
Law is an alumna of the 
University of Virginia, where 
she earned a bachelor’s de-
gree in civil engineering, and 
of Boston University, where 
she earned a master’s degree 
in business administration. 
Law has also taught high 
school math and science, cre-
ated online learning models, 
and developed and imple-
mented curricula.

Brainhub engineers receive NSF grant
In mid August, the Na-
tional Science Foundation 
(NSF) awarded assistant 
professor of biomedical en-
gineering Steven Chase, as-
sistant professor of electrical 
and computer engineering 
and biomedical engineering 
Byron Yu, and University of 
Pittsburgh associate profes-
sor of bioengineering Aaron 
Batista an $869,000 grant 
to study how variability in 
movement is encoded in the 
brain. 
“These teams are build-
ing on creative ideas from 
within and beyond neurosci-
ence,” said Kenneth Whang, 
NSF program director in 
the Computer & Informa-
tion Science & Engineering 
Directorate, in a university 
news release. “We’re seeing 
some dynamic new research 
collaborations that will have 
huge impacts on fundamen-
tal questions, and on what 
we can discover or invent in 
the future.”
This award is one of 16 
that the NSF gave out this 
year, totaling more than 
$13.1 million, to support 
cognitive and neural systems 
research. 
The researchers will re-
cord the neurons in the mo-
tor and premotor cortices 
of moving animal models, 
hoping to establish a connec-
tion between variable neural 
responses to motion, perfor-
mance, and learning.

Highway Administration, 
Suresh has also announced 
several large donations by pri-
vate companies and alumni in 
the past year. Most notably, 
David A. Tepper is working 
with the university to create 
a new campus quadrangle for 
the business school in what is 
now the Morewood Gardens 
parking lot. 
This research initiative 
with the U.S. government 
more than doubles the total 
?scal support Carnegie Mel-
lon received via sponsored 
projects. With an investment 
this large, the U.S. govern-
ment is publicly endorsing 
Carnegie Mellon’s impor-
tance as an innovator and 
top research institution. The 
amount of the contract is high 
enough that the SEI is now an 
approved Federally Funded 
Research and Development 
Center. The SEI shares this 
designation with 40 other re-
search and development insti-
tutions in the United States.
According to Rahnamay-
Azar, the SEI “saw signi?cant 
revenue growth ($62.3 mil-
lion for ?scal year 2005 com-
pared to $123.4 million for 
?scal year 2014) largely from 
the Department of Homeland 
Security.” 
The Department of De-
fense dramatic increase in 
funding demonstrates the im-
portance of software technol-
ogies to the U.S. government, 
even more relevant after re-
cent hacks from China, and 
a continuing chain of attacks 
from foreign countries.

“I’m trying to get a good 
read on whether the driver-
less car is going to bene?t us. 
One of the reasons [the De-
partment of Transportation] 
takes a neutral stance on driv-
erless cars is because we don’t 
know whether driverless cars 
or vehicle-to-vehicle commu-
nications are viable in the fu-
ture,” he said in May of 2015. 
This makes Carnegie 
Mellon, as a top research cen-
ter for driverless cars, a place 
to watch for the secretary of 
transportation. Autonomous 
and interacting vehicles are 
already becoming more and 
more prevalent, and it’s not 
just Uber who would bene?t 
from autonomous vehicle re-
search. Google has long been 
developing its own driverless 
cars, and many other manu-
facturers have joined in. Mod-
ern vehicles also made big 
news this summer when two 
engineers were able to take 
control of a Chrysler Jeep re-
motely via the car’s internet 
capabilities. 
With the world talking 
more and more about the vi-
ability of the driverless car, 
Carnegie Mellon has seen its 
name in many papers and 
news stories, and that is not 
about to change; the NREC 
may just have to deal with 
some new competition.
Uber hires 40 employees from CMU robotics center
engage ?rst-year students in 
an effort to give students and 
the faculty more time to ben-
e?t from these relationships. 
The program will be run pri-
marily through a website on 
which students can register, 
which Zhu said will make it 
easier for more shy students 
to get involved. Zhu said an-
other goal of the program is to 
lower stress. The ?rst part of a 
longer plan, this program hits 
at the heart of what Zhu and 
the Academic Affairs commit-
tee work to accomplish.
“[The Academic Affairs 
Committee] works to support 
the academic welfare of Carn-
egie Mellon undergrads,” 
Zhu said. “We want to make 
sure that academically, the 
Carnegie Mellon experience 
is as good as possible.” The 
seven person Committee has 
ongoing projects to promote 
awareness of how academ-
ics tie into the conversations 
about the stress culture on 
campus. According to Zhu, 
one such project focuses on 
standardizing syllabi to make 
professor’s expectations and 
course work easier to access 
and understand for students.
“CMU has a reputation for 
stress culture,” Zhu said. “And 
even though it might not be 
as bad as other universities, 
we still need to check up on it 
often and having a dedicated 
body in student government 
working on it is crucial.” 
The program will be publi-
cized by Senate and funded by 
a special allocation from Sen-
ate, as well as gifts from Casa-
legno and Burkert’s of?ces. 
“Great things happen 
when talented, bright, and 
committed individuals get 
together. We have an ex-
traordinary community of 
individuals who comprise our 
university,” Casalegno wrote.
Students create new lunch 
program to bond with faculty
contribution will fully fund 
construction of a new build-
ing along Forbes Avenue, and 
support the Presidential Fel-
lowships and Scholarships 
program.”
This expansion, one of 
many campus improvements 
coming in the next few years, 
will transform Forbes Avenue 
into what Suresh calls an “in-
novation corridor.”
The partnership between 
TCS and Carnegie Mellon, 
Suresh says in the email, will 
“play an important role in im-
proving our ability to meet the 
needs of students, faculty and 
staff in an increasingly global 
environment.”
At the event, Suresh 
spoke about how the dona-
tion would be used to further 
Carnegie Mellon’s expansion. 
Suresh further explained the 
role the partnership with TCS 
will play in the university’s 
global reputation as a techno-
logical innovator. Suresh and 
Chandrasekaran met about 
a year ago. The two leaders, 
Suresh said, discovered im-
mediately that they had the 
same overarching ideas about 
the future of global innova-
tion, and have been working 
together since then to form a 
mutually bene?cial partner-
ship between Carnegie Mel-
lon and TCS.
“We can connect with a 
company that has the capac-
ity to engage a certain per-
centage of the globe,” Suresh 
said at the event. “Carnegie 
Mellon, as a global university, 
can also play a signi?cant role 
in taking its talents outside of 
Pittsburgh.”
Chandrasekaran, who 
traveled from Mumbai for the 
event, also spoke hopefully of 
a bright future of collabora-
tion between Carnegie Mel-
lon and TCS. “I am very, very 
happy and proud that we have 
this wonderful partnership 
developing between TCS and 
Carnegie Mellon,” he said. “As 
Subra mentioned, I’ve known 
him only for less than a year, 
but we’ve developed a very 
good alignment of thought in 
terms of what the possibilities 
are [for the future].”
Pennsylvania Governor 
Tom Wolf also spoke at the 
event, emphasizing Carnegie 
Mellon’s role in attracting 
money, research, and inno-
vation to the state of Penn-
sylvania. “[This partnership] 
shows what we can do when 
a world-class company and a 
world-class university partner 
up,” Wolf said. “This is gonna 
be really amazing for this 
place. The spirit of innovation 
we so rightly attribute to the 
market — to the free market 
— is actually magni?ed by 
this kind of marriage.”
After the speakers, Dean 
of Dietrich College and 
professor of philosophy Rich-
ard Scheines moderated a 
panel discussion on “Indus-
try-Academic Partnerships: A 
New Global Era.” the panel-
ists took questions from the 
audience, and discussed how 
TCS could work with Carne-
gie Mellon for mutual bene?t.
The panel consisted of 
Chandrasekaran, Head of the 
Electrical and Computer En-
gineering Department and 
professor of biomedical en-
gineering Jelena Kovacevic

Gecko-like adhesives offer variety of product applications
SHARON WU
Staffwriter
It’s a typical afternoon at 
the zoo, and you ?nd yourself 
looking at the exhibits of rep-
tiles and amphibians in min-
iature imitations of wild and 
exotic habitats. At one of the 
displays you notice a gecko 
crawling on a window with su-
perhero ease. You see that with 
each step taken, the lizard-like 
animal leaves no trace of a foot-
print — an observation that is 
ordinary enough to many, but 
perhaps extraordinary to a se-
lect few.
Suppose that you use your 
creative and enterprising 
mind, and you decide to turn 
this peculiar trait found in na-
ture into a product that could 
transform the prospects of 
many businesses and the 
lives of many people. That is 
exactly what Metin Sitti, a me-
chanical engineering professor 
at Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, has spent nearly ten years 
working on.
“The source of inspiration 
was the amazing climbing abil-
ity of geckos on almost any 
surface in nature,” Sitti told 
The Tartan in an email, as he 
described the beginnings of his 
product, Setex™, an adhesive 
that functions much like the 
sticky feet of geckos. A mem-
ber of both the Department of 
Mechanical Engineering and 
the Robotics Institute, Sitti has 
studied the lizard-like crea-
tures in an 
effort to develop micro/nano-
?brillar adhesives. Setex™ is 
the ?rst adhesive of its kind to 
be commercialized.
The project started when 
Sitti was completing his post-
doctoral research at the Uni-
versity of California, Berkeley. 
While on a trip to Thai-
land, a biologist collaborator 
on the team proposed the idea. 
Sitti’s team then studied the bi-
ological dry adhesion principle 
of gecko foot hairs and, using 
that knowledge, Sitti created 
nanostructures that mirrored

The popularity of depth 
sensing cameras has sky-
rocketed recently due to the 
increasing prevalence of vid-
eo games, yet these cameras 
could have many other appli-
cations, making them ideal 
for further study. Research-
ers at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and the University of 
Toronto teamed up to create 
new 3-D imaging technology 
that can work in bright light 
— a trait that many other 
depth-sensing cameras and 
3-D sensors lack.
The research team in-
cluded faculty members 
from both Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of To-
ronto, including Srinivasa 
Narasimhan, an associate 
professor of robotics at Carn-
egie Mellon University; Wil-
liam Whittaker, a professor 
of robotics at Carnegie 
Mellon University; and Ky-
ros Kutulakos, a professor 
of computer science at the 
University of Toronto. The 
team also included Supreeth 
Achar, a doctoral candidate 
in robotics at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, and Matthew 
O’Toole, a doctoral candi-
date in computer science at 
the University of Toronto.
Depth cameras project a 
pattern of dots and lines over 
a scene in order to capture it. 
By doing this, it is possible to 
calculate the 3-D contours 
of a scene by analyzing the 
pattern deformation and the 
time it takes the light to re-
?ect. 
However, patterns are 
usually washed out due to 
the low-powered compact 
projectors commonly used 
in depth cameras. In order

Neurological diseases, such 
as Parkinson’s and Hunting-
ton’s disease, affect millions 
of people worldwide, making 
them ideal targets for future 
research. In the United States 
alone, Huntington’s disease 
affects nearly 30,000 people, 
according to the Family Care-
giver Alliance, while Parkin-
son’s affects approximately 
one million, according to the 
Parkinson’s Disease Founda-
tion. The prevalence of these 
diseases provides a clear mo-
tive for understanding the 
neurology behind the disor-
ders. BrainHub researchers 
from Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity and the University of Pitts-
burgh have developed a way 
to visualize parts of the basal 
ganglia, which could eventu-
ally help track the progression 
of diseases like Parkinson’s or 
Huntington’s.  
The basal ganglia, the part 
of the brain that is responsible 
for movement, is made up of 
four interconnected sections 
that, when damaged, can lead 
to diseases such as Parkinson’s 
or Huntington’s. “For reasons 
that are not fully understood, 
these connections are highly 
susceptible to damage and, 
because they are important 
for motor control, this dam-
age can result in substantial 
motor de?cits,” said Patrick 
Beukema, a graduate student 
in the Center for Neuroscience 
at the University of Pittsburgh 
(CNUP) and the Center for 
the Basis of Neural Cognition 
(CNBC), a joint program be-
tween Carnegie Mellon and 
the University of Pittsburgh. 
The research team also includ-
ed Timothy Verstynen, an as-
sistant professor of psychology 
at Carnegie Mellon and CNBC 
faculty member, and Fang-
Cheng Yeh, a postdoctoral re-
searcher in Carnegie Mellon’s 
psychology department and 
the CNBC.
These basal ganglia 
pathways have tradition-
ally been challenging to study. 
“Clinically, it is dif?cult to see 
the pathways within the basal 
ganglia with neuroimaging 
techniques, like the ever popu-
lar MRI, because many of the 
?ber bundles that make up key 
parts of this circuit are very 
small and buried within areas 
of dense cell bodies,” Beukema 
said. “Speci?cally, many of 
these ?bers are nestled within 
a set of nuclei that are known 
collectively as the globus pal-
lidus, or just the pallidum for 
short.” In order to combat this 
issue, the team turned to dif-
fusion MRI, a non-invasive 
neuro-imaging technique that 
measures the movement of

3-D printed ?sh robots help detox water supplies
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of California, San Diego 
have developed ?sh-shaped 
microrobots called micro?sh 
that are able to swim ef?cient-
ly in liquids. These micro?sh, 
unlike previous microrobots 
that were limited by simplistic 
structures, are able to perform 
tasks that require complex 
movements. The micro?sh in-
clude platinum nanoparticles 
in their tails and magnetic iron 
oxide nanoparticles in their 
heads, which allow the ?sh to 
be powered by hydrogen per-
oxide and steered with mag-
nets. These microrobots are 
currently being studied with 
regard to detoxi?cation. The 
research team included toxin-
neutralizing polydicetylene 
(PDA) nanoparticles in the 
bodies of the micro?sh, which 
allow the micro?sh to collect 
harmful toxins from the sur-
rounding environment. The 
PDA nanoparticles emit red-
colored light when bound to 
toxin molecules, which allows 
the detoxi?cation ability of the 
micro?sh to be monitored by 
the intensity of the red light 
they emit. The researchers be-
lieve the micro?sh could have 
a multitude of other applica-
tions, including directed drug 
delivery.

New self-healing material could help safety in space
Timothy Scott, an assistant 
professor of chemical engi-
neering at the University of 
Michigan, along with a team 
of researchers, has developed 
a self-healing material that 
could provide spacecrafts 
with another layer of defense 
against debris in space. Cur-
rently, spacecrafts can be 
out?tted with several dif-
ferent lines of defense. The 
International Space Station, 
the most heavily-shielded 
spacecraft ever ?own, accord-
ing to NASA, is equipped with 
bumpers that vaporize debris 
before it hits the walls of the 
spacecraft. However, if these 
bumpers ever failed, debris 
could penetrate the spacecraft 
walls, which would lead to a 
catastrophic loss of oxygen 
stores.
The new material devel-
oped by Scott’s team is able 
to heal itself after being shot 
with a bullet. The material is 
composed of a reactive liquid 
in between two layers of a 
solid polymer. When shot with 
a bullet, the liquid reacts with 
oxygen from the air to form a 
solid plug in under a second. 
The researchers believe these 
?ndings could also be useful 
for improving technology on 
Earth, such as automobiles.

Antibiotic use linked to Type 2 diabetes diagnosis
A team of researchers, in-
cluding Kristian Hallundbæk 
Mikkelsen, MD, of Gentofte 
Hospital in Denmark, has dis-
covered a link between the 
amount of antibiotics a person 
takes and their likelihood of 
being diagnosed with Type 2 
diabetes. 
In the study, the research-
ers tracked 15 years worth of 
antibiotic prescriptions for ap-
proximately 170,000 individu-
als with Type 2 diabetes and 
1.3 million individuals with-
out diabetes. Subjects were 
identi?ed using records from 
three national health regis-
tries in Denmark.
 They found that people 
with Type 2 diabetes used 
signi?cantly more antibiotics 
compared to people without 
diabetes; subjects with Type 
2 diabetes ?lled 0.8 prescrip-
tions a year, while control sub-
jects ?lled only 0.5.
 “Although we cannot infer 
causality from this study, the 
?ndings raise the possibility 
that antibiotics could raise the 
risk of Type 2 diabetes,” Mik-
kelsen said. “Another equally 
compelling explanation may 
be that people develop Type 
2 diabetes over the course of 
years and face a greater risk of 
infection during that time.”

Permian extinction caused by volcanic activity in Siberia
Around 252 million years 
ago, at the end of the Permian 
period, more than 90 percent 
of marine species and 75 per-
cent of land species vanished. 
Paleontologists now believe 
the cause of this mass extinc-
tion was volcanic activity. 
Scientists knew there was 
volcanic activity at the time of 
the extinction, but were previ-
ously unable to determine if 
this was a coincidence. To re-
solve this issue, the research 
team analyzed ancient lavas 
traced back to massive volca-
nic eruptions in what is now 
Siberia. 
The Siberian Traps erup-
tions released more than three 
million cubic kilometers of 
molten rock, which is enough 
to bury the entire United 
States to the height of the Ei-
ffel Tower.
Zircon crystals were found 
in the ash, which naturally 
form with small amounts of 
uranium that gradually de-
cays into lead. Paleontologists 
now support the hypothesis 
that volcanic gasses caused 
environmental changes that 
rendered the planet uninhab-
itable for most life on it. Re-
searchers reported these ?nd-
ings on August 28 in Science 
Advances.

Scientists equip honeybees with micro-sensors
According to the Natural 
Defense Resource Council, 
nearly one-third of all honey-
bee colonies in the USA have 
vanished. In order to address 
the global decline in honey-
bees, an international research 
team, led by the Global Initia-
tive for Honeybee Health, is 
equipping the insects with 
radio-frequency micro-sensors 
to record the bees’ behaviors. 
The Sydney Morning Her-
ald recently reported that 
15,000 healthy honeybees in 
Australia and Brazil have been 
?tted with the 5.4-milligram 
sensors.“The tiny technology 
allows researchers to analyze 
the effects of stress factors 
including disease, pesticides, 
air pollution, water con-
tamination, diet and extreme 
weather on the movements of 
bees and their ability to pol-
linate,” Dr. Paulo de Souza, 
a science leader with Austra-
lia’s Commonwealth Scien-
ti?c and Industrial Research 
Organization said. “The time 
is now for a tightly-focused, 
well-coordinated national and 
international effort, using the 
same shared technology and 
research protocols, to help 
solve the problems facing hon-
ey bees worldwide before it is 
too late.”

Blood test can predict breast cancer relapse
Researchers reported on 
August 26 in Science Transla-
tional Medicine that a blood 
test could predict up to 80 per-
cent of breast cancer relapses 
after surgery and chemo-
therapy by identifying tumor 
DNA circulating in the blood. 
This blood test detected can-
cer nearly eight months before 
scans detected the tumors.
In the study, research-
ers took blood samples from 
55 women who underwent 
chemotherapy and surgery 
to remove breast tumors and 
were at moderate to high risk 
of having a relapse. After two 
years, 15 women had a re-
lapse, and researchers found 
tumor DNA in the blood of 12 
of them as early as two weeks 
after surgery. 
The team also noted that 
the blood test was unable to 
detect tumor DNA in the brain, 
which was likely due to the 
blood-brain barrier prevent-
ing the spread of the tumor 
DNA.
This blood test could po-
tentially help doctors deter-
mine which breast cancer pa-
tients will have relapses in the 
future.

to address this problem, 
the research team created 
a mathematical model that 
eliminates extraneous light 
by programming a camera to 
work more ef?ciently with its 
light source.
“We have a way of choos-
ing the light rays we want 
to capture, and only those 
rays,” Narasimhan said in 
a university press release. 
“We don’t need new image-
processing algorithms and 
we don’t need extra process-
ing to eliminate the noise, 
because we don’t collect the 
noise. This is all done by the 
sensor.”
Using the model, a proto-
type was built that synchro-
nized a laser projector with 
a rolling-shutter camera, 
which allows the camera 
to only detect points illu-
minated by the laser. “Even 
though we’re not sending a 
huge amount of photons, at 
short time scales, we’re send-
ing a lot more energy to that 
spot than the energy sent by 
the sun,” Kutulakos said in a 
university press release. “The 
trick is to be able to record 
only the light from that spot 
as it is illuminated, rather 
than try to pick out the spot 
from the entire bright scene.” 
Using this technique, the 
camera works well under 
bright light and is also energy 
ef?cient.
There are many applica-
tions for this technology in a 
wide variety of ?elds. In the 
realm of entertainment, the 
camera could allow video-
games to be played in envi-
ronments with bright light, 
such as outdoors, without 
glare. 
Other applications in-
clude medical imaging, 
where the camera could be 
used to visualize skin struc-
tures, or manufacturing, 
where it could help people 
observe shiny materials.
The research could also 
have major implications in 
the realm of space explora-
tion. The camera could be 
used for extraterrestrial ro-
bots, visualizing dark envi-
ronments such as craters, or 
in polar regions of the moon, 
where it can be used to re-
duce glare.
In a university press re-
lease, Whittaker commented 
on the value of the sensors 
for use in outer space. “Low-
power sensing is very impor-
tant,” he said. “Every watt 
matters in a space mission.”
The research was sup-
ported by the National 
Science Foundation, the 
Natural Sciences and Engi-
neering Research Council of 
Canada, and the U.S. Army 
Research Laboratory. The 
team presented their ?nd-
ings on August 10 in Los 
Angeles at SIGGRAPH 2015,

How things work: Embalming
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
What happens to us after 
we die? Well, that’s a thorny 
question — one that has a lot 
of different answers, depend-
ing on who you ask.
There are some things we 
know for certain, however. 
When someone dies, his (or 
her) body begins to decom-
pose. Depending on the envi-
ronment, this can take hours, 
days, or weeks. A body in a 
steamy jungle, for example, 
will decompose much faster 
than a body in the frozen 
tundra.
Humans have been try-
ing for millennia to slow or 
stop this process of decay. 
The Egyptians are famous for 
mummifying their dead and 
immortalizing the greatest 
of them in elaborate tombs 
and pyramids. Native Ameri-
cans — including the Aztecs, 
Toltecs, and Mayans — all also 
had their own strategies for 
preserving dead bodies.
Today, we still do our best 
to keep bodies clean and free 
of rot and decay for as long as 
possible. Modern embalming 
began during the Civil War, 
Mary Roach writes in Stiff, a 
book chronicling what hap-
pens to us after we die. The 
Union contracted Thomas 
Holmes, a doctor, to ?nd a way 
to preserve fallen soldiers long 
enough to get them home.
Holmes started embalm-
ing infantrymen in 1861. Em-
balming got a publicity boost 
at the end of the war when 
Abraham Lincoln’s embalmed 
body traveled halfway across 
the country, from Washing-
ton, D.C. to Lincoln’s home 
state of Illinois, by rail. The 
train made stops along the 
way for viewing, and those 
who saw Lincoln’s corpse were 
impressed by how well it was 
preserved. Although 
Holmes 
died at 
the 
age of 70 after going thor-
oughly insane — an unsur-
prising fate for the so-called 
“father of modern embalm-
ing” — the practice of em-
balming lived on.
While early embalmers 
claimed that embalming was 
permanent, today’s funeral 
homes set more realistic ex-
pectations. An embalmed 
body is meant to look fresh 
and (relatively) lifelike long 
enough for an open casket 
funeral service, but not much 
longer. Water reverses the 
chemical reactions that make 
embalming work, so when 
an embalmed body is buried 
under moist soil it soon be-
gins to decompose in earnest. 
Although funeral homes sell 
sealed vaults and cof?ns, it’s 
hard to guarantee eternal 
preservation — corpses can 
contain bacteria spores, or 
DNA pods that survived the 
embalming process and will 
eventually break the body 
down.
There are different ways to 
embalm a body, but the most 
common method is arterial 
embalming. When a body is 
brought to a funeral home, 
an undertaker hooks up a 
pump to 
the 
corpse’s right carotid artery in 
the neck. The pump circulates 
embalming ?uid, a solution of 
different chemicals, through-
out the body.The most impor-
tant ingredients in embalming 
?uid are preservatives, like 
formaldehyde and methanol. 
These chemicals work to kill 
the bacteria that cause decom-
position, and keep cells from 
collapsing.
As a body begins to ?ll with 
embalming ?uid, the skin ?lls 
out and takes on a healthy-
looking red ?ush — embalm-
ing ?uid also contains dyes 
to make the body look more 
natural. The embalmer mas-
sages the corpse to help circu-
late the embalming ?uid and 
break up blood clots and, if 
circulation is poor, will pump 
?uid in through other entry 
points. As ?uid ?lls the body, 
blood drains out through a 
tube in the artery.
When the ?uid has been 
distributed through the veins, 
the undertaker opens the 
body’s main cavity and suc-
tions out the natural ?uids 
with a trocar, a vacuum-like 
instrument. The cavity is then 
?lled with embalming ?uid 
and sealed off.
After all of the blood and 
other ?uids in the body have 
been replacing by embalm-
ing ?uid, the embalmer often 
applies makeup to make the 
cadaver look its best before 
it’s dressed up for the funeral. 
The undertaker also puts cot-
ton in the corpse’s mouth to 
make it look natural, avoiding 
the sunken cheeks so charac-
teristic of death.
Although embalming is 
not the only way to deal with 
a dead body, it is the most 
common in the United States. 
We may never know exactly 
what happens to us when we 
die in a metaphysical sense, 
but we at least have 
the basic science of 
preservation down 
pat.
Water reverses 
the chemical 
reactions 
that make 
embalming 
work, so when 
an embalmed 
body is buried 
under moist soil 
it soon begins to 
decompose in 
earnest.

those hairs. 
Despite their initial efforts, 
however, Sitti’s team at Berke-
ley had issues creating large 
pieces of adhesives that could 
mimic the gecko’s ability to 
?rmly grip and repeatedly at-
tach to a surface. Sitti later 
became a professor at Carn-
egie Mellon University, where 
he continued his work as the 
principal investigator of the 
NanoRobotics Laboratory. In 
the laboratory, he and his col-
leagues focused on the design 
and mass production of the 
gecko-like adhesives.
“We could not achieve high 
performance for [the] ?rst two 
to three years, and my PhD stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon were 
almost giving up” Sitti said. 
“However, after changing the 
tip ending shape of our gecko 
adhesives, we suddenly started 
having similar and even better 
performance than biological 
gecko adhesives!”
The breakthrough allowed 
Sitti’s team to eventually pat-
ent the design and creation of 
the synthetic ?bers in the ad-
hesive, which are made from 
elastomeric polymers. Thanks 
to the saucer-shaped endings 
of the ?ber tips, the millions of 
tiny, micron-scale ?bers have 
the ability to stay in steady 
contact with a surface through 
intermolecular forces. Rather 
than altering the chemistry of 
the adhesive, Sitti and his re-
searchers were able to create 
an adhesive tailored to a spe-
ci?c application by engineer-
ing its microstructure.
The researchers also 
focused on developing a 
method of production for the 
adhesives. “In my team, from 
day one, we have aimed at 
developing a manufacturing 
process that can produce large 
areas of synthetic adhesives 
in high speeds with low cost,” 
Sitti said. While other research 
groups have also attempted to 
make synthetic gecko adhe-
sives, their performance does 
not meet the caliber of Sitti’s 
due to the patent on the ?ber 
tip geometry and design of 
Setex™.
In collaboration with one of 
his PhD students, Sitti founded 
nanoGriptech, a company for 
his synthetic gecko adhesives. 
The company received funding 
for its ?rst few years from a 
program within the Depart-
ment of Defense.
Since 2009, nanoGriptech 
has been applying their ad-
hesive technology to create a 
variety of products for their 
customers in a variety of sec-
tors, including apparel, gloves, 
manufacturing, medical de-
vices, product design, ?exible 
packaging, and robotics. The 
company has embarked on 
many projects, such as cre-
ating gripping materials for 
sports and industrial gloves, 
?exible closures for sports, and 
soldier apparel and friction 
adhesives for medical devices 
on skin or other tissues. “Setex 
will perform better than many 
existing repeatable adhesive 
products,” Sitti said. “It also 
has unique features that have 
not been possible before by 
any product.”
The company is currently 
working on further improv-
ing its adhesive to address 
the needs of different kinds of 
product applications. It is also 
looking to bring more of their 
product out into the market.
As legions of scientists 
and engineers look for ways 
to invent and innovate their 
products in a technologically 
advanced world, sometimes 
nature can prove to be the best 
place to ?nd ideas. After all, 
the Pittsburgh Zoo is only a bus 
ride away.
New adhesive mimics gecko biology
water molecules and creates a 
visual depiction of the brain’s 
physical connections, called 
axons. Two types of diffusion 
imaging, diffusion spectrum 
imaging and multi-shell im-
aging, were used to scan the 
brains of healthy individuals. 
The team found that not only 
could they detect the small 
?bers of the basal ganglia us-
ing diffusion imaging, but 
they could also distinguish 
between small components 
of the brain, speci?cally the 
internal and external global 
pallidus. 
“Both of these ?ndings sug-
gest that the diffusion signal 
might serve as a marker of the 
collective health of key basal 
ganglia pathways and po-
tentially be used to track the 
progression of diseases like 
Parkinson’s or Huntington’s 
disease,” Beukema said.
He also noted the potential 
for future research stemming 
from their results.  “This work, 
of course, raises more ques-
tions than it answers. One 
question is whether or not this 
technique is sensitive enough 
to be used as the foundation 
for a novel in-vivo biomarker 
of the health of these path-
ways in disease,” Beukema 
said. He also noted the neces-
sity of testing new techniques 
in patient populations, as op-
posed to healthy individuals. 
“The pathways that Patrick 
has been able to visualize are 
critical to so many functions, 
yet we haven’t been able to 
see them in the living human 
brain before,” Verstynen said 
in a university press release. 
“This opens the door to so 
many research and clinical op-
portunities.”
The team’s research, which 
was published in NeuroImage, 
was funded by a National Sci-
ence Foundation BIG DATA 
grant, the Army Research 
Laboratory, and the CNUP. 
The research also bene?tted 
from open access data pro-
vided by Washington Univer-
sity, the University of Minne-
sota, and Oxford University, 
known as the WU-Minn HCP 
consortium.

CMU computer science should stress ethics
Hugo Awards need to embrace diversity
Last summer, gamers banded 
together in an attempt to push in-
dependent game developer Zoë 
Quinn out of the industry. Quinn 
was targeted by hate mail, online 
harassment, and a tell-all blog post 
written by a former boyfriend. This 
deplorable example of misogyny 
in the gaming industry came to be 
known as “gamergate,” an example 
of rampant sexism in the video game 
industry.
Now, science ?ction writers are 
facing their own version of gamer-
gate. In April, the ?nalists for the 
prestigious Hugo Awards were 
announced. 
The Hugo Awards are one of 
science ?ction’s highest prizes for 
novelists, and the ?nalists are deter-
mined by ballot. Any member of the 
2014, 2015, or 2016 World Science 
Fiction Convention (Worldcon) can 
cast their vote, meaning that anyone 
who paid the $40 membership fee 
has a say.
This year, a fringe movement of 
right-wing voters — the self-named 
“Sad Puppies,” a play on so-called 
Liberal “bleeding hearts” — in?u-
enced the contest to bring their picks 
to the top. The group, headed by 
conservative authors Brad R. Torg-
ersen, Larry Correia, and Vox Day, 
pushed Worldcon members to vote 
for a speci?c shortlist of authors.
Although this is the third year 
that the Sad Puppies have tried to in-
?uence the Hugo Awards, this is the 
?rst year that their efforts have had a 
noticeable impact. Three of the ?ve 
best novelist nominations are on the 
Sad Puppies shortlist, and the Best 
Novella nominations match the Sad 
Puppies’ picks exactly.
The authors chosen, many say, 
are not representative of science ?c-
tion as a whole and crowd out pro-
gressive and minority authors. John 
C. Wright, for example, one of the 
authors nominated for his novellas, 
is known for his outspoken homo-
phobic viewpoints.
The Sad Puppies’ undue in?uence 
on the Hugo Awards is a step back-
wards for a society gradually moving 
in the general direction of equality. 
The Sad Puppies represent a fringe 
group that is ?ghting against a sci-
ence ?ction scene that is more di-
verse than it has ever been.
Worldcon must rework its vot-
ing system, making it harder for one 
group to sway the nominations. Be-
yond this, however, science ?ction 
and fantasy fans and authors should 
?ght against such conservative jury 
rigging, continuing to make World-
con and the Hugo Awards more 
inclusive of diverse, progressive 
authors.
Fans should embrace the more 
nuanced science ?ction and fantasy 
created by the younger, more diverse 
crowd of authors that would not 
have gained the same kind of rec-
ognition in the seventies or eighties, 
rather than trying to strike it down.

Trump remains favorite despite shortcomings
XIYU WANG 
Staffwriter
Donald Trump is the kind of pres-
ident who would start a nuclear war 
with Kim Jong-Un over a spat about 
whose hair is dumber. Why then is 
he leading the polls among the Re-
publican candidates? I assumed 
at ?rst that it must be the work of 
a group of political trolls, like the 
people who wrote in Darth Vader 
as a candidate for Ukraine’s prime 
minister. However, there seem to be 
a number of people who sincerely 
support Trump, which completely 
baf?es me. Here are my best guesses 
to what constitutes Trump’s appeal. 
Trump has always been known 
for his talent of shameless self-
promotion, and is undoubtedly the 
most famous of all the 28 declared 
GOP candidates. As such, it is no 
mystery why Donald Trump has had 
more media exposure than any oth-
er candidate in the election.  
Through Trump’s personal ce-
lebrity may explain his appeal to 
some uninformed or disinterested 
voters, Trump’s popularity among 
active, discontented voters is the 
most confusing aspect of his candi-
dacy. I understand the anger over 
the entrenched, do-nothing political 
establishment. 
I, too, feel that politicians these 
days are disconnected from average 
Americans, and that bold visionary 
leadership is necessary to change 
the state of American politics. With 
that said, why is Donald Trump the 
man some voters want to represent 
that discontent?  
The Atlantic published a let-
ter from a supporter who called 
Trump “authentic.” This is a valid 
point. Donald Trump is authenti-
cally an obnoxious, mean-spirited 
moron; he spews out whatever stu-
pid thought is on his mind with no 
?lter. As an alternative to the ster-
ile, politically correct statements of 
most mainstream politicians, it may 
feel refreshing at ?rst but surely this 
schtick must become old within a 
month or so. 
Other than his brashness, Trump 
has very little to offer. He has no 
political experience, can’t take any 
form of criticism, and is massively 
uninformed about policy; he honest-
ly thinks deporting all the illegal im-
migrants in the United States is an 
easy process, it’s just that we haven’t 
done it yet. Trump supporters often 
cite his business leadership, but this 
is questionable. Say what you will 
about Mitt Romney and his robotic 
personality, but at least Romney 
seems like he has the maturity and 
intelligence to excel in business. 
What other Fortune 500 CEO in the 
United States behaves like Trump? 
Despite running a billion dollar em-
pire, Trump apparently has the time 
to engage in petty public feuds and 
frivolous lawsuits; he once ?led a 
defamation suit against an author 
who wrote that Trump was a mil-
lionaire instead of a billionaire. Fur-
thermore, it is very telling that four 
of Trump’s major enterprises have 
declared bankruptcy in the last 25 
years. 
Unfortunately, the main basis 
of Trump’s support seems to be the 
xenophobic narrative he has put for-
ward. Trump’s campaign to “Make 
America Great Again” is solely based 
on stopping illegal immigration. He 
has said next to nothing about edu-
cation reform, income inequality, 
or foreign policy positions, among 
countless other important issues. 
This less than subtle scapegoat-
ing becomes particularly egregious 
given that in the past 10 years, the 
illegal immigrant population has de-
clined from its 2007 peak, according 
to Pew Research. 
The fact that such a transparent-
ly xenophobic platform has gained 
such a large following in America 
is highly disturbing, especially in 
the wake of the recent incident in 
Boston in which two brothers beat 
a homeless man simply because he 
was Hispanic. According to The At-
lantic, one of the assailants cited 
Trump as an inspiration behind the 
attack. 
Donald Trump’s rapid rise in poli-
tics is deeply unsettling in terms of 
what it says about certain segments 
of American society: the unques-
tioning acceptance of shallow po-
litical theater, the mob-like anger at 
the American political system, and 
the discomforting xenophobia that 
somehow still persists in a nation of 
immigrants. Even if Donald Trump 
fails to secure the GOP nomination, 
these attitudes won’t go away so 
easily and will be highly in?uential 
on national politics in the years to 
come.
As reported by The Tartan last 
week, Morgan Culbertson, a junior 
electrical and computer engineer-
ing major at Carnegie Mellon, was 
charged by the Department of Jus-
tice with developing and distributing 
malware.
This is not the ?rst time a Carne-
gie Mellon student has been charged 
with malicious software activities. 
While it is certainly far too small a 
sample to call this anything close to 
a systemic issue, it highlights a need 
for more prominent computer sci-
ence ethics courses. This is not to dis-
parage the classes that already exist: 
Students who are interested have the 
opportunity to take classes that grap-
ple with very dif?cult philosophical 
and ethical issues surrounding the 
development of technology through 
classes like Ethics in Policy Issues 
and Computing. That is certainly a 
necessary and great course to offer, 
but it is insuf?cient. Carnegie Mellon 
should offer a course in more practi-
cal computer ethics, like the impacts 
of malicious software.
While most people probably 
known generally that malicious 
software is bad, classes do more 
than drive this point home. Firstly, 
many people refuse to engage with 
ethical issues because they do not 
have the vocabulary or con?dence 
in their ability to discuss them. Eth-
ics classes can address these con-
cerns by offering some background 
on the issues. Beyond a detailed 
analysis of the issues surround-
ing the acts themselves, such as 
the consequences of identity theft 
or the legal consequences, ethics 
classes create a safe space for moral 
disagreement and foster discourse 
using the background that students 
gain from the class. This helps fos-
ter critical thinking about issues 
and leads to ethics becoming more 
than a vague notion of badness sur-
rounding an action.
While ethics is not particular to 
any ?eld, the relative newness of 
computer science leaves many ques-
tions unanswered. Many of these in-
volve very interesting areas of philos-
ophy. However, this does not mean 
that these issues should comprise 
all of the ethics education computer 
science students receive. As technol-
ogy increasingly impacts large areas 
of our lives, thinking critically about 
the role of ethics for computer scien-
tists and programmers is important 
to computer science and engineering 
as a whole.

Orientation staff must improve diversity to better re?ect CMU life
VINAY VISWANATHAN
Junior Staffwriter 
For an incoming ?rst-year stu-
dent at Carnegie Mellon, Orienta-
tion Week is a special time to start 
your college experience, make new 
friendships, and expand your iden-
tity.  First-year students are guided 
through this ?rst week of college by 
a cast of volunteers from the Depart-
ment of Student Affairs, known as 
Orientation staff: Orientation Coun-
selors (OCs); Orientation Leaders 
(OLs), who supervise OCs; and Head 
Orientation Counselors (HOCs), the 
student Orientation coordinators for 
a given ?rst-year housing community 
who direct OLs and OCs. 
These positions are complement-
ed by paid RAs and, in certain com-
munities, mentors or ambassadors 
unaf?liated with Orientation staff.  
For many ?rst-year students, their 
OCs, OLs, and HOCs form their ?rst 
impression of Carnegie Mellon and 
set a foundation for the rest of their 
time at our school.
 Carnegie Mellon prides itself on 
its diversity.  The university’s Diver-
sity Resource Guide reads that Carn-
egie Mellon is “a community that un-
derstands diverse perspectives and 
backgrounds breed the intellectual 
vitality essential for the health and 
progress of the university.”
Yet, the Orientation staff does not 
re?ect this diversity.  A current OL, 
who asked to remain anonymous, 
said that “[Orientation] gives an 
inaccurate representation of what 
Carnegie Mellon is really like.”
Perhaps the most notable sign 
of a lack of diversity in Orientation 
staff is the gross overrepresentation 
of Greek students, which is linked 
to an underrepresentation of inter-
national students and minorities. As 
of the Spring 2015 Greek Report, 23 
percent of Carnegie Mellon’s student 
body is involved in Greek life. 100 
percent of HOC’s (8/8) and 75 per-
cent of OL’s (18/24) are members of 
Greek organizations on campus. 
A ?rst-time OC, who also asked 
to be quoted anonymously, said 
that “When I decided to apply to be 
an OC, I was told by a lot of people 
that the odds of me being accepted 
weren’t that great because I wasn’t 
Greek. Therefore, when I did get ac-
cepted, I saw it as an achievement 
and my non-Greek status as one of 
my strengths. However, once training 
began, I quickly came to realize that 
me not being Greek was actually an 
initial setback. The Greek commu-
nity at CMU is pretty tight knit and 
as a ?rst-time OC who is not active 
in Greek life, I felt like an outsider. 
Everyone knew each other and it was 
really hard for me to talk to people I 
had never even seen before without 
any context. I especially felt like a mi-
nority, which was uncomfortable and 
unnerving.” 
The high proportion of Orienta-
tion staff who are members of Greek 
organizations causes a sense of exclu-
sivity within the staff. As ambassa-
dors of the student body as a whole, 
Orientation staff should give an ac-
curate representation of the student 
body and promote the inclusion of 
varied perspectives, backgrounds, 
and organizational involvement. 
The aforementioned OL sug-
gested, “being Greek doesn’t make 
a bad OC, but creates an unrealistic 
expectation that you have to be a 
member of the Greek community to 
be involved on campus,” adding, “We 
also need more international stu-
dents and people of color.” In order 
to showcase the diversity of Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus community we need 
to focus more on diversity as a crite-
ria for OC selection.
While the exact number of inter-
national students in Orientation staff 
is hard to determine due to the lack of 
public information about a student’s 
citizenship status, the total number 
of international students is estimated 
to be between 3 and 6 percent of the 
total Orientation staff, despite the 
student body boasting a makeup of 
19.3 percent international students 
(from 69 unique countries). 
The previously mentioned OC 
lamented, “There are barely any in-
ternational students who are OCs, 
and that’s a problem because of our 
increasing international student 
population.” International students 
have the greatest need for a smooth 
acclimation to campus, since they are 
adjusting to an entirely new country 
and culture in addition to a new edu-
cational institution.  The Orientation 
staff needs more international stu-
dents as OCs to make incoming inter-
national students feel welcome and 
comfortable.
The Orientation staff selection 
process is largely student driven, 
with some involvement from the Di-
vision of Student Affairs.  With the 
group interview and the individual 
interview, both guided by HOCs and 
OLs, these students have a major in-
?uence in the pick of OCs.
A 2014 Morewood E-Tower OC 
who requested to be anonymous cites 
the Orientation selection process 
as the key issue here, mentioning, 
“because of the overwhelming num-
ber of HOCs and OLs who are Greek, 
there were a lot of applicants who 
had Greek relationships with HOCs 
and OLs, it gives the people who 
know the HOCs priority and helps 
them be distinguished from the rest 
of the pool.” 
Some may argue that the lack of 
diversity is due to the initial applicant 
pool rather than the selection process 
itself.  Of course, if the general ap-
plicant pool is itself overrepresented 
with Greek students and underrep-
resented with international students, 
?nding a diverse set of OCs and OLs 
becomes dif?cult.  If this is the case, 
a greater effort to recruit OC appli-
cants through different channels, 
such as academic advising, multicul-
tural organizations, and RAs.
If the fault is with the selection 
process itself, perhaps greater faculty 
and staff involvement is necessary in 
each cycle of interviews.  Addition-
ally, diversity could be more readily 
used as a metric when housing com-
munities and their HOCs choose their 
Orientation staffs. 
In either case, a solution is both 
possible and necessary. Carnegie 
Mellon is a rich, diverse community 
— it is imperative that our Orienta-
tion staff re?ect that.
CMU should accomodate expansion
RUSSELL HOLBERT
Junior Staffwriter
This past week, Carnegie Mellon 
welcomed more than 1,580 ?rst-
year students to campus, the largest 
class of incoming students in its his-
tory. Because of the massive in?ux of 
students, the university had to make 
some accommodations. A handful 
of Donner doubles have been repur-
posed as triples, and many ?rst-year 
students are now living in Shirley 
Apartments on North Dithridge 
Street: a location past the former 
?rst-year housing boundary, the 
Residence on Fifth. 
The University is expanding at a 
rapid rate. Academic buildings reach 
past Forbes Avenue and deeper 
into Oakland, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s living alumni number 
100,000, and the student 
body is experiencing 
rapid annual growth. 
A side effect of 
this growth is a 
rede?nition of 
what’s consid-
ered “cam-
pus” and how 
the student 
population 
is spread 
across it. 
Carnegie 
Mellon of-
fers many 
apart-
ment-style, 
university-
owned hous-
ing options, 
such as Fairfax, 
Shady Oak, and 
Webster. 
The purpose of 
this style of housing is 
to give students the inde-
pendence of living off-cam-
pus while still living on univer-
sity property. These locations also 
come with physical separation from 
campus, which juniors and seniors 
often prefer. 
With this geographical distance, 
Carnegie Mellon has made great 
efforts to ensure that students can 
safely commute between campus 
and their residence. These measures 
include the 217 emergency phones 
stationed throughout campus and 
the vigilance of University Police.
However, there is no separation 
from the risk that distance presents. 
Shirley Apartments is privy to that 
risk, being the same distance from 
the Residence on Fifth as the Resi-
dence on Fifth is from campus. In the 
realm of housing, especially when it 
comes to 
?rst-year students, the Carnegie Mel-
lon campus is far from contiguous. 
This is not to say that Housing 
Services and University Police are 
not doing their jobs — they are, in 
fact, performing very well. Housing 
was quick to adapt to the size of the 
?rst-year class, and University Police 
are constantly patrolling university 
areas to ensure safe living and learn-
ing environments. 
As the school year continues, 
Housing Services and the university 
administration should keep an eye on 
the distance between campus proper 
and the newest addition to the ?rst-
year residential community — if 
not just for the sake of safe-
ty and security, then 
for the sake of 
community.

Every time I see the words, 
“Make America Great Again,” 
I imagine an enormous, medi-
eval-style wall following the Rio 
Grande, complete with Trump Ca-
sinos at every mile. Immigration 
is an important topic this election 
season, which is made clear by the 
fact that the only position on Re-
publican presidential candidate 
Donald Trump’s website is immi-
gration reform.
Trump supports tightening our 
borders, calling illegal immigrants 
rapists, murderers, and straight-up 
criminals. In addition, many con-
servatives trumpet stolen American 
jobs, a high cost to society, and viola-
tion of American law as downsides 
of immigration.
While Trump’s site describes 
the details of a brutal murder con-
ducted by an illegal immigrant, it 
turns out that these “criminals” 
have a lower crime rate than near-
ly every ethnic group of U.S.-born 
citizens. 
According to a report conducted 
by the Migration Policy Institute, 
American-born citizens have an in-
carceration rate of 3.51 percent. In 
comparison, foreign-born American 
Hispanics have an incarceration rate 
ranging from 0.2 percent to 2.2 per-
cent, depending on their nation of 
origin.
Trump describes how $4.2 bil-
lion in tax credits were given to il-
legal immigrants in 2011. However, 
this reveals not an issue with illegal 
immigration, but with our nation as 
a whole. 
If we are giving $4.2 billion 
to 11 million illegal immigrants, 
how much are we giving to the 
300 million citizens present in this 
nation? Of course, most illegal im-
migrants are not contributing to our 
tax revenue, due to the fact that if 
they submitted their income to the 
IRS, it may be the last income that 
they submit in the U.S.
Trump and other conservatives 
argue that these people should not 
be crossing our border because it is 
against the law. However, the law is 
not a perfect, unbreakable contract 
handed down by a higher power. 
It is a structure of rules created by 
fallible people. According to Cam-
bridge attorney and author Harvey 
Silvergate, the average American 
committed three felonies a day in 
2009. Since then, the thousands of 
pages added to the U.S. Code likely 
increased that number. 
Illegal immigrants are not steal-
ing American jobs on a large scale; 
they are simply ?lling a void in 
the American economy. Many are 
working well below the minimum 
wage, as more and more Americans 
begin to support increasing it. Ac-
cording to a Hart Research Associ-
ates study, 63 percent of Americans 
support a $15 per hour minimum 
wage. Increasing wages and ben-
e?ts, however, cripples small com-
panies, many of which may have 
no other option than to ?nd labor 
under-the-table.
While it is clear that our coun-
try needs some kind of immigra-
tion reform, kicking 11 million 
people out of the country is not the 
answer. 
The Great Wall of Trump, which 
experts estimate to cost tens of bil-
lions, according to NBC, is also not 
the solution. 
The solution is giving people the 
chance to become citizens and the 
chance to contribute to society. As 
people shout more and more about 
closing the border, they forget the 
origin of our nation. We are all im-
migrants, and we are all part of the 
American Dream.

Rising Vikings and waning Broncos might shift standings
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
As the NFL season ap-
proaches, the short season 
and massive rosters in football 
always result in a few surpris-
es as the year goes along. This 
article will look at two teams 
who may have some surprises 
in store — one team to im-
prove and one to regress.
Minnesota Vikings
The Vikings are relying 
on second-year quarterback 
Teddy Bridgewater to turn 
in a stellar year in his second 
season. The good news for 
Minnesotans is that Bridgewa-
ter’s success is an increasingly 
likely proposition. 
Bridgewater’s poise in a 
collapsing pocket and pin-
point accuracy are hallmarks 
of successful quarterbacks. 
While Bridgewater is not as 
pro?cient on deep routes, he 
improved vastly as last season 
went on. 
Minnesota’s offseason ac-
quisition of wide receiver Mike 
Wallace helps give Bridgewa-
ter a deep threat to open up 
more space for the medium 
length routes the quarterback 
is best at.
The return of running back 
Adrian Peterson may help, 
but the team seems to have 
qualms about letting him play 
after his run-in with the law 
for abusing a child last fall.
On the defensive side, the 
Vikings’ youth means the de-
fense will naturally continue 
to improve.
Cornerback Xavier Rhodes, 
safety Harrison Smith, line-
backer Anthony Barr, and 
defensive lineman Everson 
Griffen are all likely to im-
prove on excellent campaigns 
last year. Barr, in particular, 
showed off both his raw ath-
leticism and the coaching abil-
ity of head coach Mike Zim-
mer with his incredible ability 
to disrupt offenses and disci-
pline necessary to not leave gi-
ant gaps in coverage to chase 
big plays. This defense could 
be exciting next year.
There are still obstacles for 
the Vikings, though: their of-
fensive line is atrocious. While 
running back Jerrick McKin-
non and Bridgewater can suc-
ceed behind a bad line, they 
could be in for a tough year if 
guys like left tackle Matt Kalil 
continue to be turnstiles. The 
schedule might be one of the 
toughest in the league. How-
ever, this young and talented 
team can improve from where 
they were last season and 
maybe ?nd their way into the 
playoffs if things break right.
Denver Broncos
The Broncos’ most obvi-
ous weak link is their quarter-
back. Peyton Manning’s hall of 
fame career is moving toward 
its end, and for the last few 
weeks of last season, it was 
starting to look ugly.
It became clear by the end 
of the season that Manning 
had strained a muscle in his 
leg, and he has been losing 
arm strength for quite a while. 
This could be the season he 
?nally does not have enough 
zip on his throws to be a domi-
nant quarterback based purely 
on his excellent ability to pre-
dict defenses. 
Losing tight end Julius 
Thomas also takes away one 
of Manning’s key targets, and 
hurts the underneath spacing 
as tight end Owen Daniels also 
approaches the twilight of his 
career. 
The Broncos also suffered 
major losses in other areas. 
They are playing with a second 
year center, Matt Paradis, who 
came in as a sixth round pick. 
They’re also stuck with rookie 
tackle Ty Sambralio — neither 
he nor Paradis have ever start-
ed an NFL game. 
Though guard Evan Mathis 
is excellent, continuity is im-
portant on an offensive line. 
In order to know what gap a 
player should cover, he has to 
know the range of the player 
next to him. Mathis’s late sign-
ing could damage the chemis-
try of the group. Manning has 
a quick release, but he is basi-
cally immobile and can have 
a hard time escaping the rush 
if the line falters. Some hits 
could do serious damage.
Furthermore, the defense 
lost a major presence in tackle 
Terrance Knighton, on top 
off the loss of safety Rahim 
Moore. Neither player was 
given a meaningful replace-
ment. Further, cornerback 
Chris Harris’s amazing season 
last year might have been a 
case of playing over his head. 
Any regression could pull the 
Broncos back to Earth.
The Broncos will still be 
a playoff team, but it will be 
hard for them to secure a ?rst 
round bye and they might 
be vulnerable if the Chiefs 
or Chargers play beyond 
expectations.

Diving coach Alicia Gorman named Director of Aquatics
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
On Sept. 1, head diving 
coach Alicia Gorman will be-
gin her time as Director of 
Aquatics and Facility Manager.
In her own words, Gorman 
is “responsible for all activities 
that happen within our aquat-
ics facility at the Cohon Uni-
versity Center” in her new role 
as aquatics director. This in-
cludes scheduling classes and 
practices for various teams 
that use the pool as their main 
athletics facility, as well as su-
pervising lifeguards.
Gorman is, for the most 
part, happy with what the 
pool currently has to offer, 
saying that she is “looking 
forward to continuing the ex-
cellent programming that we 
have been able to offer to our 
campus community.”
With new upgrades to the 
pool, Gorman is “excited to 
see what programming we 
will be able to expand. I will 
be working with Sara Gaunter, 
Assistant Director of Athletics, 
and Pattye Stragar, Fitness Op-
erations Manager, to expand 
our offerings in the aquatics 
arena.” Gorman will also be-
gin teaching ?tness classes in 
Spring 2016.
Her position as Aquatics 
Director will not prevent her 
from continuing as head div-
ing coach, however. She will 
retain that position in the 
coming year.
As the diving coach, Gor-
man believes that “partici-
pating in collegiate athletics 
should fully enhance each 
student athlete’s college expe-
rience.”
She says she ?nds coaching 
to be collaborative. She works 
with the coaches to help drive 
the team to its goals as well as 
students. Gorman said that 
it is her job to teach students 
the value of collegiate sports-
manship by “meet[ing] them 
where they are academically, 
athletically, and socially to 
help them ful?ll all of their 
goals.” 
Some of the practices 
themselves will be moved 
to morning to accommo-
date Gorman’s new position 
as aquatics director, but the 
rigor of the practices will not 
change, featuring 5–6 days a 
week of practices and two days 
a week of weights. In order to 
get nearly equal time training 
on both diving boards, Gor-
man has divers alternate each 
day between the 1-meter and 
3-meter boards.
According to the Carnegie 
Mellon Athletics Department, 
Gorman will also open the 
athletics facilities in the Jared 
L. Cohon University Center 
and will manage the ?tness 
center that will be opening in 
May.
Despite eighth ranking, CMU Football remains optimistic
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Last Friday, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s football team 
held a scrimmage with the 
Waynesburg University Yellow 
Jackets. The two teams en-
gaged in 7-on-7 drills and line-
men drills before pitting their 
special teams, offenses, and 
defenses against each other in 
earnest.
Both teams generated 
plenty of excitement from 
the crowd in the stands. The 
?rst 7-on-7 play for the Tar-
tans saw senior quarterback 
Andrew Hearon connect with 
senior wide receiver Max Rein-
ertsen. They reconnected on 
their ?rst drive against the full 
Waynesburg defense, convert-
ing a fourth-and-long situation 
and setting up the stage for a 
touchdown on the next play. 
The defense was able to make 
some good plays, too, includ-
ing a few interceptions against 
the various Waynesburg quar-
terbacks.
Going into the season, the 
Tartans are optimistic about 
their chances in their second 
season as an af?liate mem-
ber of the Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC). Last year, 
the Tartans ?nished in seventh 
place out of eleven teams with 
a 4–6 record, tying the records 
of St. Vincent College, West-
minster College, and Thiel 
University.
Though they are projected 
to ?nish in eighth place ac-
cording to the 2015 PAC Pre-
season Poll, the players and 
coaches feel differently.
“We had a great offseason 
with those kids, they work ex-
tremely hard and spring ball 
went well,” head coach Rich 
Lackner said at a question and 
answer session in early August. 
“I put a lot of stock in chemis-
try and hopefully we will have 
great chemistry with this team 
this season.”
Senior wide receiver Chris 
Herrera agrees. “A lot of us 
took summer workouts seri-
ously,” the civil engineering 
major said.
Herrera cites the returning 
talent on offense and defense 
as reason to believe the Tar-

Class of 2019+ exhibits talent
First year showcase on Saturday night brings variety of passions
On Saturday night, students of the class of 
2019+, Orientation staff and members of the 
Carnegie Mellon community had the privilege 
of witnessing just a few of the talents of 
those in the first year class. After a week of 
Orientation craziness — Playfair, House Wars, 
and information sessions galore — hundreds 
of people gathered in the Baker Lawn tent to 
celebrate the diversity of the passions present on 
campus. 
The evening started out with an endearing 
and heartfelt performance by two Boss House 
students, Ghalyea Alsanea, pianist, and Johanna 
McAllister, vocalist. They sang a rendition of 
Regina Spektor’s Folding Chair. Though there 
were a few bumps along the way, the duo 
charmed the audiences when they incorporated 
a hill cheer into a part of the song, demonstrating 
to the crowd that house spirit was still alive and 
well. 
Next was a first-year from Donner House 
named Riki Khorana, who explained to the 
crowd his desire to transform their ideas about 
what ukuleles can sound like. He cited Jake 
Shimabukuru as his inspiration, and then 
proceeded to play a wildly virtuosic classical 
piece. Not only was the sound that Khorana 
coaxed out of the ukulele amazing, but he was a 
dynamic and captivating showman as well. Like 
so many of last night’s performers, his academic 
interests, which include engineering, are focused 
in a completely different area than the talent he 
demonstrated. 
Morewood E-tower first-year Gaurav 
Balakrishnan also played ukulele 
while singing a very beautiful 
Coldplay song. His soothing 
voice was comforting and 
wonderful to listen to.
The theme of home — 
new and old — was 
present throughout 
the showcase. Slam 
poet Hamza Qureshi, 
Mudge first year, 
recited a spoken 
word poem that 
he had written the 
night before he left 
to come to Carnegie 
Mellon. Before his 
performance 
began, he 
explained to 
everyone in 
the tent that 
they should 
snap if they felt 
connected to 
what he was 
saying. Over the 
course of the 
piece, Qureshi 
eloquently 
described his 
experience 
of saying 
goodbye, 
and how 
when 
faced with 
saying goodbye 
an individual realizes 
things they might not have otherwise. As the 
poem went on, more and more individuals inside 
the tent snapped their appreciation. After his 
performance, Qureshi invited those who wanted 
to learn more about slam poetry to ask him about 
it, inviting members of the community to come 
enjoy and get engaged in a passion of his. 
Other highlights of the evening included an 
impressive hula hoop performance by Allison 
Black that had individuals whooping and 
hollering, two very different dance performances 
by Yuyan Sun and Janet Lee, a yo-yo 
performance by Alex Nelson, classical guitar by 
Joseph Kim, show tunes sung by Daniel Brennan 
and Emily Gallagher, and the performance of an 
original song by Nicole Korogodsky. 
The evening wrapped up with the orientation 
slideshow, giving students the ability to reflect 
on their jam packed week and the amazing, 
passionate individuals they are embarking on a 
university adventure with. Support, enthusiasm, 
and kindness radiated throughout the event.

Advice for awkward people
Greetings, Joshua
I am a first year in 
the class of 2019(+?), 
majoring in 15-112 
and Red 9, and I 
am experiencing 
some major issues. 
Orientation was such a 
stimulating experience, 
but this week, classes 
are going to start. 
Throughout my life, 
I have been an avid 
collector of street art, 
such as lightly chewed 
gum, mint-condition 
bottle caps, and blurry 
iPhone pictures of 
graffiti. 
I am having major 
anxiety because I do 
not know whether or 
not I will be able to 
balance my passion 
for collecting and my 
passion for my school 
work. Could you provide 
me with some advice, oh 
wise one?
Signed, 
Majorly Anxious Girl, 
Pacing In Earnest 
Dear MAGPIE,
College is a balancing 
act. There are hundreds 
of things vying for your 
attention at any given time, 
and it’s part of the growing 
process to figure out what 
to focus on and what can 
fall by the wayside. Maybe 
you’ll find that you need to 
concentrate your collecting 
to just bottle caps and 
photos and let the gum go. 
Or maybe not. 
What you will find, though, 
is that being very busy 
forces you to prioritize, and 
this prioritization allows 
you insight into your true 
passions. 
So collect that street 
art, code some amazing 
games of Tetris, and use 
all $810 of those Dinex 
dollars on chips and 
cheesecake. This is your 
year. You’ve got this.
Or just get some Trident 
from Entropy,
Joshua Brown.

4bachelorette
pillbox 08.31.15
ABC’s The Bachelor franchise is one that continues 
to endure years after its conception. A show in 
which one individual seeks true love by combing 
through and kissing a wide variety of impossibly 
beautiful suitors, The Bachelor and its spin-off 
The Bachelorette have a devoted fan following and 
viewership continues to skyrocket. As one of the 
franchise’s devoted fans, I am overeager when it 
comes to trying to predict the winner, avoiding 
online spoilers, and grabbing snacks for viewing 
parties with friends, but I also spend time thinking 
about the issues that are front and center within the 
franchise, including diversity issues. There is little to 
no diversity, and there hasn’t been since the nation’s 
introduction to The Bachelor, The Bachelorette, or 
any other spin-off show. 
This summer’s bachelorette was no exception. In 
fact, since the beginning of the show twelve years 
ago, only one star, of either The Bachelor or The 
Bachelorette, was a person of color. After a rise in 
the number of contestants of minority backgrounds 
in the 2013 to 2014 seasons — to two or three out of 
roughly 30 — that number has once again slipped 
to one or two per season. Even then, minority 
contestants are almost always voted off immediately. 
During Chris Soules’ season last winter, Saturday 
Night Live aired a skit making fun of diversity issues 
on The Bachelor, claiming that all individuals of 
color were voted off by the fourth week. It’s hard 
to understand why, in this day and age, ABC and 
franchise producers find it challenging to come 
up with a diverse cast. In fact, The Bachelor has 
faced two separate lawsuits relating to problems of 
diversity by potential contestants. The franchise, 
however, sticks by its First Amendment rights to 
cast whoever it wants on the television show. 
The show is also exclusively heteronormative. There 
is nothing wrong with a male bachelor looking for 
love from a big group of women — besides, you 
know, how weird a situation it is — but after 12 years 
and almost 20 seasons, it is necessary and important 
to have a bachelor or bachelorette contestant who 
identifies as bisexual or gay. As a huge cultural 
staple, whatever that says about our nation, it would 
be my hope that this bizarre and ridiculous television 
show could attempt to represent more Americans. 
This season’s bachelorette was Kaitlyn Bristowe, 
a dance instructor from Vancouver, whose funny 
laugh and inappropriate jokes made her a favorite 
contestant from Chris Soules’ season. While diversity 
issues persisted, Kaitlyn’s season was able to address  
a serious issue that came up during the course of 
the show’s run. While the show does not shy away 
from showing some pretty serious make-out sessions, 
the topic of more “serious” hook-ups, and sex, go 
unspoken. 
Toward the end of each season, 
the last few remaining contestants 
are allowed to spend a night in the 
“fantasy suite” with the Bachelorette. 
This is a chance for them to spend 
the night together and have some 
off-camera time, and, presumably, 
sleep together if they so desire. 
While this is the implication, 
Bristowe is the first bachelorette 
to admit to sleeping with someone 
on the show, in an episode where 
she slept with one of her potential 
suitors halfway through the season. 
This generated a lot of hate mail for 
Bristowe, and a lot of wildly offensive 
slut shaming from the American 
people. In the “After the Final Rose” 
special, an episode that airs after 
the bachelorette has picked a man, 
Bristowe and host Chris Harrison 
shared a lot of the terrible tweets 
and messages that Bristowe had 
received as a result of her confession. 
While reading them out loud on live 
television was a bit of a strange 
choice, the amount of positive 
feedback and support for Bristowe 
was impressive. Bristowe defended 
her actions and her decisions with 
poise, and called out her haters for 
their bigoted, shameful, and hateful 
comments. 
I felt that this demonstrated 
the power of the bachelor and 
bachelorette, and the show itself, 
to enact change and open people’s 
minds. Even more than before, I 
feel like this shows the untapped 
potential of The Bachelor and The Bachelorette. I 
think people often feel as though reality shows need 
to be pure fluff, or that a stupid premise begets a 
stupid message. I don’t think reality television show 
producers should be resigned to making a show 
that’s all pretty people and no substance. While 
I don’t believe that The Bachelorette will all of a 
sudden blossom into a show that preaches love and 
kindness and depth of emotion, I do feel like there 
is a way to turn this side of pop culture into a place 
where other Americans can see themselves and 
important issues can be addressed. Then I would 
love these shows even more.

Summer coming-of-age ?lm embraces Pittsburgh
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl uses the city as a backdrop while examining adolescent life
It’s always cool to see your city on the silver screen, and 
even cooler when you’re missing that city like crazy due 
to summer break distance. This summer, a movie came 
out that was not only set in our lovely Pittsburgh, but 
was also really good and had a killer cast.
Me and Earl and the Dying Girl, based on the book of the 
same title by Point Breeze, Pennsylvania native Jesse 
Andrews, is a story about awkward high school senior 
Greg Gaines (Thomas Mann). Greg is neither popular 
nor unpopular; he likes to ?oat through Schenley High 
School — recognize the name? Remind you of a certain 
campus-adjacent park perhaps? — never settling within 
a single group. His only friend, Earl (RJ Cyler), is referred 
to as a “business partner.” The two eat lunch in the of?ce 
of their history teacher Mr. McCarthy (Jon Bernthal). 
On his ?rst day of school Jesse, learns that Rachel 
Kushner (Olivia Cooke) has leukemia, and after being 
informed of this by his mother, he is also told by his 
overbearing parents, Connie Britton and Nick Offerman, 
that he must befriend Rachel. This leads to a plan 
between Greg and Earl, suggested by Greg’s high school 
crush Madison (Katherine C. Hughes), to make Rachel 
one of their intentionally-terrible movie parodies, such 
as “Pooping Tom”, which up until this point have been 
based on odd foreign ?lms and have been seen by no 
one.
Throughout the course of the ?lm, Greg and Rachel’s 
friendship develops and we get to see them navigate 
senior year, illness, and uncomfortable friendship. We 
also get to see them explore a fair amount of Pittsburgh. 
As a Carnegie Mellon student and a member of the 
Pittsburgh community, it was pretty cool to see Cathy 
(The Cathedral of Learning) peeping out over the 
houses on Earl’s street, and through Rachel and Greg’s 
windows. 
Viewers may also recognize the record store Greg, Earl, 
and Greg’s father visit in Polish Hill to ?nd inspiration 
for their Rachel ?lm and the corner shop they stop to 
get popsicles after accidentally eating pot cookies. A lot 
of the food the Gaines family eats, primarily Dr. Gaines 
and Earl, has Polish heritage, giving a nod to the cultural 
communities throughout the city. The director was 
careful to make sure the Pittsburgh vibe made it into the 
?lm, becoming a character in and of itself.     
 
Though not included in the on-screen adaptation, the 
book tells us that Dr. Gaines is a professor of the classics 
at our lovely alma mater, which is a little strange because 
we do not have a classics department. Greg also explains 
what a Yinzer is, so if you’re not yet aware, check out 
that description at the beginning of Chapter 12.
Each character also lives in a different Pittsburgh 
neighborhood — Greg and Rachel in Squirrel Hill and 
Earl in Braddock, which is where you’d end up if you 
were to take the 61A or 61B outbound to the end of 
the line. These neighborhood names will mean next to 
nothing to anyone not from Pittsburgh, but for those of 
us who call the Burgh home — even if it’s just for four 
years — it gives the ?lm that much more depth. We can 
envision the layout of these characters’ lives, map their 
paths for ourselves, and, if tempted, could even retrace 
their steps.
If you enjoy quirky, indie comedies like I do, I highly 
recommend this ?lm. It has a vibe much like Submarine 
(Ayoade, 2010), The Way Way Back (Faxon & Rash, 
2013), or The Perks of Being a Wall?ower (Chbosky, 2012)
which was also shot in Pittsburgh.
Another interesting Pittsburgh movie note: the “Rocky 
Horror” scene from The Perks of Being a Wall?ower was 
shot at Hollywood Theater in Pittsburgh and included 
most of the theater’s “Rocky Horror” shadow cast. I 
highly recommend going to a “Rocky Horror” showing 
there, but make sure you’re dressed for it!
All in all, Me and Earl and the Dying Girl does a great 
job of being a movie about teenagers in Pittsburgh. 
It fully encapsulates the dif?cult task of existing in a 
clique-?lled world while being an awkward 17 year old. 
It conveys the dif?culty and annoyance of applying to 
college — Greg applies to the University of Pittsburgh, 
our Oakland neighbor. It places the characters in a 
world that the director and writer understand, making 
Pittsburgh both a place and a character and making 
it fun for those of us who live in the city to ?nd our 
landmarks. 
It also tackles the incredibly dif?cult topic of childhood 
cancer while not making it the ?lm’s only point. The 
characters keep their teenage-angst I-don’t-care attitude 
while being affected by the fact that one of them has 
leukemia. They exist in the wake of mortality. Greg 
struggles to not constantly remind Rachel that she’s 
dying, and Rachel tries to remain a teenager in her 
senior year. There are a lot of laughs and a few moments 
that make you tear up; there are existential questions 
and poop jokes; funny accents and weird food; Nick 
Offerman (who is always perfect), and behind it all is 
the Pittsburgh sky, with Cathy looming and no overly 
photographed landmarks making sure you notice them.
Whether or not you live in Pittsburgh, this ?lm is great, 
but since we’re here, it’s nice to notice our home around 
it all.

There’s a joke about Pixar that their movie premises can 
be boiled down to “What if [blank] had feelings?” What 
if toys had feelings? Toy Story. What if ?sh had feelings? 
Finding Nemo. What if robots had feelings? Wall-E. And 
the list goes on
Pixar is really good at applying human experiences to 
non-human entities; they’ve boiled it down to a formula 
that keeps viewers coming back every time. Inside Out, 
Pixar’s critically-acclaimed summer blockbuster, took the 
exploration of emotions to a new extreme. In this sense it’s 
the quintessential Pixar ?ick. Except there’s one element 
that gets ?ipped on its head: the con?ict.
We’re used to being handed a classic tale of good versus 
evil. The protagonist must look within him or herself, ?nd 
the strength that was there all along, and defeat some kind 
of villain. There is probably some kind of epic battle or 
showdown.
Inside Out breaks the mold with an internal struggle. 
There’s no super villain, no school bully, just dealing with 
emotions. The entire con?ict is inside the main character’s 
mind. Her name is Riley; she’s a little girl whose life is 
completely changed when her father’s job moves their 
family from Minnesota to San Francisco. The audience 
sees her struggle to adapt to this new life from the 
perspective of her emotions.
In Pixar’s creative imagination of our brains, there are ?ve 
little people up in Headquarters controlling our actions: Joy 
(Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Fear (Bill Hader), 
Anger (Lewis Black) and Disgust (Mindy Kaling). They all 
work in chaotic but perfect harmony to maintain Riley’s 
memories and core values, keep track of dreams, and help 
her make important decisions. Through their narration, 
we meet Riley, learn about her life, and watch as she 
grows more and more uncomfortable in her new home. 
What really sets the movie into motion is when Joy and 
Sadness get lost in long-term memory and Fear, Anger 
and Disgust are left running the show — clearly a pleasant 
combination.
With these three at the helm, Riley turns into every pre-
teen just hitting the crest of adolescence. As she makes 
rash, destructive choices in real life, the consequences in 
her mind are dire. Hockey island, family island, goofball 
island, and honesty island, representing the values and 
interests that make up her personality, start crumbling 
into the abyss, sending the emotions into a panic. Riley’s 
relationships with her parents and peers weaken, and she 
can’t ?gure out how to control her moods.
As Joy and Sadness attempt to make it back to 
Headquarters with the help of Riley’s childhood imaginary 
friend Bing Bong (Richard Kind), Sadness ?nally realizes 
her purpose. Before, she only seemed to cause tantrums, 
crying, and more sadness. But through revisiting these sad 
memories, Joy helps her realize that sadness is Riley’s way 
of asking for help and support.
The two return to Headquarters just in time to stop Riley 
from making an irreversible mistake, and get her home to 
her parents where she is ?nally able to share the way she 
has been feelings since their move. The ?nal half hour of 
the movie comes with the heartfelt softness of all Pixar 
movies, and there’s a good chance it will even make you 
cry.
But what sets this movie apart is the takeaway. Because 
the con?ict was internal, so was its resolution. Riley’s 
struggle can teach an important lesson to viewers of all 
ages and backgrounds, but my hope is that it will resonate 
with children who still have time to change. The lesson is 
that feelings are okay.
The movie also shows the cast of emotions in Riley’s 
parents, which makes for an entertaining scene, but more 
importantly shows that everyone has feelings. It’s perfectly 
natural to have emotions of all kinds, not just happiness, 
but sadness, fear, anger, disgust, all of the above and 
otherwise. It’s part of being a human, especially at Riley’s 
age.
Many of the kids that saw Inside Out this summer are 
coming up on puberty and will start having these kinds 
of hormone-driven episodes of angst. Riley can show 
these kids and other teens that they aren’t alone in it; 
many of their friends and peers are probably experiencing 
something similar.
The resolution of the ?lm teaches a more important but 
less popular lesson: that it’s bene?cial to express your 
emotions. Tons and tons of people have a hard time talking 
about their feelings in order to come to a positive solution, 
opting instead to internalize them. This is easier at the 
time and allows you to save face, but in the long run, it 
only damages your emotional well-being and maturity.
I sincerely applaud Pixar for creating a movie that focuses 
on more a personal, sentimental concept with real-life 
applications to its viewers. Inside Out has the potential to 
inspire a vast audience to become more sensitive, which 
can bene?t everyone.

five characters integral to the story as they control 
Riley’s life from inside a creative imagining of the brain.

elections
pillbox 08.31.157
This summer has been an interesting one. There 
hasn’t been a summer this politically charged in 
recent memory. From Greece’s financial crisis to 
the presidential race in the U.S., it has been a lot 
to keep track of. Lately, entertainment and media 
have focused on the presidential race, especially 
the Republican primary race. Although we are still 
6 months away from the actual primaries, every 
single news channel has been hyper-focusing on 
one special person in the primary race. No, it’s not 
the old man from the Northeast that calls himself a 
“democratic socialist,” it’s also not the former First 
Lady running for President for the third time, not 
even the son of a former President, and brother of 
another one, and it’s not even the neurosurgeon. Yes, 
it’s Donald Trump. 
Donald Trump is a genius, but only when it comes 
to manipulating media to his advantage and how to 
become the most annoying person in all of television. 
Otherwise, though, he’s terrible for America. I have 
been devoted to understanding American politics 
for the longest time, so a lot of my friends constantly 
come to ask me about how I feel about the current 
political scene and how they are portraying Trump 
lately. 
In the past few weeks, Trump has been ubiquitous on 
every television screen for yelling racist, xenophobic, 
and misogynistic remarks, to just being good old 
Donald and hating on everybody for everything 
always. Media and news outlets revere him as king 
for leading early polls among Republicans, but they 
have failed to produce any true political analysis of 
his campaign and what it means for the future of the 
Republican Party and the nation. Podcasts, however, 
have been a bit more critical of his campaign and 
most of the ones I have been listening to, even the 
conservative ones, agree on the same scenarios: 
One, he wins the primary and then only gets 20 to 35 
percent of the general population’s vote, securing the 
election for the Democrats; two, he loses the primary, 
goes as an independent and “steals” around 15 
percent of the vote from the Republican candidate, 
securing the election for the Democrats; and three, 
he steps out of the race, leaving the rest of the 
election to the Democratic and Republican candidate 
and letting them battle it out. 
The other two most important things about Trump 
that I am excited for are his contributions to SNL 
(this will be great for Saturday Night Live, all of the 
Late Night people have taken their jabs at Trump, 
he’s proven to be comedy gold), and how this will 
impact Miss Universe (NBCUniversal and Univision 
are not broadcasting the event, and several Latin 
American nations have dropped from the race — 
they tend to win these pageants, so it should be an 
interesting year)
For the rest of this semester, all of these topics will 
continue to come into fruition as they develop and 
are covered by many outlets.

When given respite from Carnegie Mellon’s typical 25-
hour work day, we have a wealth of things to do in the 
city we study in. Pittsburgh, once dominated by dreary 
steel mills and heavy industry, has long moved on to 
establish itself as the major cultural nerve center of the 
region. From museums and art to sports and concerts, 
Pittsburgh has something for you no matter what your 
inclinations. Things are especially interesting this 
coming Fall semester, with such a wealth of things to do 
that you’d actually feel sorry you didn’t have more time. 
Watch a Game
Pittsburgh happens to be one of the most sports-crazy 
cities in the U.S., and for good reason. In the Steelers, 
Pirates, and Penguins we have world class football, 
baseball, and hockey teams, respectively. 
What’s more, their respective home venues — Heinz 
Field, PNC Park & the CONSOL Energy Center — are 
landmarks of their own. PNC Park, for example, offers 
some of the best views of downtown Pittsburgh. Even 
if you don’t particularly understand sports, the sheer 
enthusiasm of thousands of fanatical Pittsburgh fans 
all around you is so infectious that you’ll ?nd yourself 
jumping up in your seat and cheering along with 
everyone else.
Catch a Concert
Pittsburgh is a regular stop for most artists on tour. Most 
play at Stage AE, Mr. Smalls Theater, or the First Niagara 
Pavilion, with a few of the largest acts taking over the 
CONSOL Energy Center. The third week of September, 
for example, is jam packed with concerts. Of Monsters 
and Men is coming to Stage AE on Sept. 16, Death Cab 
For Cutie is coming to Stage AE on the 17th, and Lady 
Antebellum is coming to First Niagara on the 18th. So if 
you’re a fan of folksy, introspective rock, you might want 
to pick up tickets as soon as possible. 
Later in the semester we have Mac Miller, Pentagram, 
Seether, Mark Knop?er, Stevie Wonder, Jason Aldean, 
Janet Jackson — you name it. There’s some concert or 
another on nearly every weekend; tickets, for most part, 
can be found on Ticketmaster. You might want to book 
reasonably early though, as concerts do ?ll up pretty 
quickly.
Fright Nights @ Kennywood
Kennywood is a local amusement park around a 20 
minute drive outside of the city. For most of the year, 
Kennywood is best known for its timeless wooden roller 
coasters, several of which were conceived in the early 
1900s and have won numerous accolades in the decades 
since. Every weekend leading up to Halloween, however, 
the park hosts Fright nights. 
Open from 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. on Friday and Saturday 
for Fright Night, Kennywood undergoes an extensive 
Halloween-themed Makeover. Fog blankets the park, 
spooky music ?lls the air, costumed actors scare 
unsuspecting park guests, and up to thirteen haunted 
houses are set up for guests to explore. Added to this 
is the thrill of some of Kennywood’s regular attractions 
in the dark. The Black Widow offers some of the most 
amazing views of nighttime Pittsburgh to distract you 
as you hurtle to the ground face ?rst, held in place by a 
simple shoulder harness. The Phantom’s Revenge, the 
park’s biggest roller coaster, is so much scarier when you 
can’t see the fog covered ground. Fright Night is a great 
thing for those October nights when you want to have a 
little adventure. 
Go To A Museum
Pittsburgh happens to be home to a plethora of 
museums ranging from massive to niche establishments, 
most of give Carnegie Mellon students free admission. 
The Carnegie Museum of Art, the Carnegie Museum of 
Natural History, and Phipp’s Conservatory, are within 
walking distance of campus. 
The Carnegie Museum of Art especially is a nice place 
to spend a free afternoon, featuring tons of thought 
provoking contemporary art.The Carnegie Cafe within 
the museum also happens to serve some of the best food 
in Oakland. Another noteworthy visit is the Andy Warhol 
museum downtown. The Andy Warhol is the largest 
museum worldwide to be dedicated to a single artist, 
and yet manages to be surprisingly accessible to people 
not well versed in Warhol’s work. Pay the Warhol a visit 
for an introduction to Pop Art, and to learn about the life 
of one of Carnegie Mellon’s most illustrious alumni. 
My personal favorite, however, has to be the Mattress 
Factory, a small independent establishment in North 
Pittsburgh. Although it is a little dif?cult to get to 
without a car, the Mattress Factory is well worth a visit 
at some point. Its exhibits are room sized installations, 
created by on-site artists. Each exhibit ends up being 
less a discrete work of art and more an entire space that 
inspires you to think about the world around you in a 
new way.

This Week In Movies: August 31, 2015
Twice a year we enter, what I like to call, “The Movie 
Offseason.” Along with January–February, we’re coming 
into the late-August–September season of movies that 
just don’t measure up. Studios take some time to catch 
their breath after an explosion-fueled summer and 
gear up for the playoffs — Oscar season. I anticipate 
these next weeks to be slow at the theaters, but the PR 
Department of major studios are still at work cranking 
out some interesting news to keep us all biting our nails. 
Let’s get into it.
 
Toby Kebbell up for Kong: Skull Island
 
This is a shining light for Hollywood. There was a time, 
quite recently in fact, when one bad movie could set an 
actor back years in their career. Mike Myers (The Love 
Guru) and Ryan Reynolds (Green Lantern) know this 
all too well. Seeing Fantastic Four and knowing Toby 
Kebbell, the young, unsung talent that he is, is still being 
sought after puts a big, wide smile on my face. 
Kebbell would join the ranks of Tom Hiddleston (Thor, 
The Avengers) and Jason Mitchell and Corey Hawkins 
(Straight Outta Compton) along with other actors in 
negotiations: Samuel L. Jackson, Brie Larson, and John 
C. Reilly. The Legendary and Universal Studios ?lm is 
described as, “a team of explorers venture deep inside 
the treacherous and primordial home of the king of the 
apes.” Kebbell’s role is undisclosed, but his marvelous 
work as Koba in last summer’s Dawn of the Planet of the 
Apes might just give us a clue.
Christian Bale to star as Enzo Ferrari in new 
biopic
 
Director Michael Mann has a special talent for getting 
the best performance out of his actors. Previous biopics, 
such as Ali and Public Enemies, along with celebrated 
works: Collateral and The Insider, prove that point, and 
harping on Christian Bale’s talents is like harping on 
Yo-Yo Ma’s — I think we all understand he’s great. Based 
on the book Enzo Ferrari: The Man, The Cars, The Race, 
The Machine, I hope the pieces come together once 
again for another Oscar-level ?lm.
Jennifer Lawrence & Amy Schumer team for 
sisters comedy
 
I don’t know what kind of writing skills J-Law has, but 
her charisma and free-spirited lifestyle make this writing 
duo an obvious match and extremely intriguing. Amy 
Schumer’s “pull no punches” comedy style is a breath of 
fresh air in the politically correct world we’ve entered, 
and pure comedy is Lawrence’s last frontier. She’s taken 
action heroine (X-Men and the Hunger Games series), 
drama (Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle, and 
Joy: coming soon), and horror (House at the End of the 
Street) but starring in a laugh-out-loud popcorn comedy, 
in the vein of Kristen Wiig and Melissa McCarthy, 
alongside Schumer might be just what the doctor 
ordered.
In an interview with The New York Times, Lawrence 
admitted they’re “almost done writing” and put roughly 
100 pages worth of comedy on paper. Considering 
Lawrence’s level of stardom and talent and Schumer’s 
newfound, and long awaited, ?lm comedy power, don’t 
be surprised when this project gets put on the fast-track 
for theaters.
First photo from Assassin’s Creed ?lm featuring 
Michael Fassbender in costume
 
With comic-book movies still at bat, video game movies 
are certainly on deck. We’ve been hearing rumblings 
of video game adaptions swirling around for years, but 
only now are we getting some real results. First up is 
Duncan Jones’ Warcraft, set for June 2016. Forthcoming 
are the likes of Splinter Cell, Metal Gear Solid, Minecraft, 
The Last of Us, Uncharted, Portal, Angry Birds (Yes, that 
Angry Birds), and, of course, Assassin’s Creed. Michael 
Fassbender stars as Callum Lynch, a descendent of 
family in a secret order of assassins. Directed by Justin 
Kurzel, who directed Fassbender to critical acclaim as 
the title role in the upcoming Macbeth, Fassbender’s 
newest character will utilize his deadly lineage to 
experience the life of Aguilar, his ancestor, in 15th 
century Spain on a mission to dismantle the Knights 
Templar.
The picture looks perfect! It’s Af?eck in the Batsuit. 
Reynolds as Deadpool. Upcoming movies are so 
shifty that we can never know until we know. When 
real photographs of characters get released, or 
announcements of production schedules happen, movies 
become real and we can ?nally say, with authority, how 
excited we are to see it on screen. Truthfully though, this 
pic has little signi?cance. It’s simply a man in a costume. 
But because this time it’s that man in that costume, we 
can all rejoice and be glad.
