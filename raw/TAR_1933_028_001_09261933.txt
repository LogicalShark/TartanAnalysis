will be established soon and in 
which they will continue their 
study of the1 structure of molecules.
Besides his work in cellulose and 
explosives he has done important 
research in the formation of coal 
and petroleum, in the cracking of 
oils and asphalt, and in the cataly­
tic hydrogenation of bituminous 
coal by which it is hoped to pro­
duce ojl from coal. He also has 
studied anti-knock compounds, the 
combustion of motor fuels, water 
purification, and manufacture of 
acids.

Freshman Regulations begin on 
campus today at 12 o’clock and will 
continue until Thanksgiving, Roger
D. Middlekauff, '33, chairman of 
the Regulations Committee of Stu­
dent Council has announced. No 
drastic changes have been- made in 
the plans since last year. The 
shortened regulations period will 
again be observed, beginning with 
the annual Plebe parade around 
the campus. The parade is man­
aged by Cwens, sophomore honor­
ary for women, and Scimitar, men’s 
sophomore honorary. During the 
regulations period Freshman regu­
lations, as published in the Plebe 
“Bible,” will be strictly enforced. 
Weekly trials will be held in each 
school for the purpose of penaliz­
ing infractors of the regulations.
Assisting Mr. Middlekauff in the 
enforcement of regulations are the 
presidents of each school senate, 
and the Dormitory Councils. To­
day's initiation activities will be 
in the hands of Scimitar, and Vir­
ginia Mathews ’36, Margaret Mor­
rison, and Louise Wingold '36, Col­
lege of Fine Arts.
Students who are to receive ex­
emptions from Freshman Regula­
tions are instructed to report to 
the “Y" office Thursday morning 
at 12:30.
The first student council meet­
ing of the year will be held tonight 
at 7 o’clock in the “Y” clubroom. 
All committee chairmen for this 
year's Student Council, with a few 
exceptions, have been announced. 
They are: Albion Feiulerson,
Budget; Robert Schell, Special; 
Clifton Carr, Social; Charles Dietz, 
Publications; John Sayles, Elec­
tions; Roger Middlekauff, Regula­
tions; John Hiltz, Activities. The j 
chairmen of the Executive, For­
eign Relations, and Spring Car­
nival committees have not been 
named.
A revised and amended list, of 
budget rales to be followed by all 
committee chairmen has been 
formulated by Student Council.
This list will be published in 
next week’s Tartan.

Graduate Elected 
Magazine Editor
The appointment of Harry Kolb 
’32, as editor-in-chief of the Tem­
ple of Phi Kappa was announced 
last month at the annual Phi Kap­
pa convention in Cleveland, Ohio. 
The Temple is the official national 
magazine of Phi Kappa fraternity 
and is published quarterly for ac­
tive members and alumni.
Mr. Kolb was editor-in-chief of 
Tartan during his senior year at 
Carnegie. He was registered in 
the Mechanical Engineering De­
partment and belonged t.o Dragons, 
men’s senior class honorary, and 
to Delta Skull, junior class hon­
orary. He was a member of Theta 
Tau, Tau Beta Pi, and Scabbard 
and Blade. The past year he has 
been doing graduate work in en­
gineering at tlie University of 
Michigan.
Majors Offered in Physics, 
Biology, Mathematics, 
Geology, Chemistry
To meet the needs of students 
who desire a broad foundation in 
the sciences, Carnegie will give 
this fall a course in General Sci­
ence in the College of Engineer­
ing. This new program, in trend 
with the demands of the time, will 
equip the student to assist in re­
search work in scientific labora­
tories, to teach science, or will 
serve as a basic course for medical 
studies.
The first two years of the course 
are similar to those in the Engi­
neering Courses, and are alike for 
all students electing General Sci­
ence.
All students in General Science 
will take Mathematics, 36 units; 
Chemistry, 36 units; Physics, 24 
uiiits; Biology, 18 units; Geology,
9 units; English, 30; units; Modern 
Language, 54 units; Economics, IS 
units; History, 12 units; and Gen­
eral Electives, 27 units. One-half 
of the junior year and two-thirds 
of the vsenior year are elective. 
During this time the student may 
pursue major work in either bioi- 
ogy. chemistry, geology, mathe­
matics, or physics.
A sophomore may register in 
General Science this fall. During 
the year lie must decide on the 
fields in which he wishes to take 
major and minor work. He will 
then confer with the head of the 
department in which he wishes to 
take his major work and, with the 
approval of the department head, 
outline a course of study for the 
junior and senior years, showing 
the electives which he wishes to 
take in each semester. The stu­
dent will then submit this pro­
gram of study to the Committee on 
General Science Courses for ap­
proval before March first. The 
committee consists of Professor 
Harry S. Hower, chairman: Pro­
fessor O. T. Geclceler, and Profes­
sor II. L. Lang.
First Tea Dance 
To Be Held Wed.
Mortar Board, national hon­
orary society for senior women, 
will sponsor a tea dance to­
morrow afternoon in Thistle 
Hall from 4 to 6 o'clock. This 
being the first event of its kind 
this year, it will informally be­
gin campus affairs. Freshmen 
are specially invited to attend.
The orchestra selected is the 
Frank Milton’s band which 
played at Carnegie last year. 
Jean Ritzel is chairman of the 
committee for the dance. She 
is assisted by Mary Husband 
and Evelyn Gamble.
Admission prices are twenty- 
five cents for women and thirty- 
five cents for men.
Govt. Economies 
Cause Cuts In 
R.O.T.C. Salaries
The uncertainty that surrounded 
the continuance of the R. O. T. C. 
at Carnegie and other Institutions 
last spring has been removed for 
the time being at least.
Operations of the department 
will continue without' curtailment, 
it was learned from Captain Acker­
man, although the economic pro­
gram of the government necessi­
tates a reduction in salary of all 
members of the unit. As in pre­
vious years, the Military Depart­
ment will recruit one hundred men 
for the advanced unit.
The thirty-dollar uniform allow­
ance for the first year advanced 
men has been reduced to twenty- 
five dollars, although the ten-dol­
lar uniform allowance for second 
year advanced men remains un­
changed. The subsistence allow­
ance for advanced men has also 
been reduced from thirty cents a 
day to twenty cents less 15 per 
cent.
Summer Drama Course Is Planned; 
Series Of Plays Will Be Offered
Requests for a summer course in 
the Department of Drama have in­
creased so in number that there 
is good reason to believe that the | 
administration of the Summer 
school 'will plan to offer next sum­
mer a program which will include 
both theory and practice in the 
arts of the theater and the produc­
tion of a series of plays in the 
Theater of the College of Fine 
Arts. A group of inter-related sub­
jects has already been considered 
and whether or not it is ultimately 
offered will depend largely upon 
the nature of the response.
The program is intended to ap­
peal both to those who are inter­
ested in participating in amateur 
dramatics and to teachers who .de­
sire experience or technical train­
ing. Students already registered 
in the department may have cer­
tain credits of the summer session 
applied to the requirements of 
their regular course, provided ap­
proval has been secured in ad­
vance. Since aptitude for one or 
more branches of such an inten­
sive course is essential, admission 
will he detérmined only after in­
terviews with the facuLty.
Bills of both one-act and full- 
length drama will be given at least 
once a week and the performances 
will take place in the evening to 
avoid conflict with classes. Natur­
ally, students who enroll in the 
Department of Drama must expect 
to be intensively occupied. That 
is, however, exactly the desire of
those who seek instruction and ex­
perience in dramatics, a fact that 
is governing the organization of 
this course.
This announcement carries with 
it the prospect of an enrichment of 
social diversion at Carnegie 
through the frequent performance 
of plays open to all members of 
the Tech Summer School. It also 
offers to those already registered 
in the department the opportunity 
to continue their intensive train­
ing over the summer. That this 
will be popular is shown by the 
large number of drama students 
who find employment in their 
chosen work each summer.
A total of twenty units composes 
the drama course under consider­
ation, and registration will be ac­
cepted only for the group as a 
whole. Diction, however, will be 
offered as an unrelated subject for 
those who do not. vjlsli the full 
course. The subjects offered will 
be as follows: Play Production,
including rehearsal and perform­
ance, stage business, pantomime, 
and make-up, 12 units; Stage Craft, 
including the mechanical problems 
of theater arts, methods of stage 
construction, lighting, and costum 
ing, 2 units; Diction, consisting of 
the development of the voice, 
standard English pronunciation, 
and clarity and beauty of enuncia­
tion, 4 units: Aesthetic Dancing, 
developing elasticity, suppleness 
and freedom of movement in the 
body, 2 units.

“E5' GRADE DROPPED 
FROM OLD SYSTEM
The first General Assembly of 
the year will be held on Tuesday, 
October 3, at 11:30 in the Carnegie 
Music Hall. Shorey Allan, Presi­
dent of Student Council, will pre­
side at the assembly, addressing 
the students at the beginning of 
the program and presenting the 
speakers. This first assembly has 
as its purpose the introduction or 
freshmen to the real Carnegie 
spirit as evidenced in these all­
college meetings.
As the principal feature of this 
assembly, Howard Ilarpster, ’28, 
football cqach, and Donald Lovo- 
well, ’2S, assistant coach, will be 
formally introduced to the college. 
These two graduate Cnrneglans, On 
campus for the first time in five 
years, are new to upperclassmen 
and freshmen alike. They will 
each speak to the students for a 
few moments on topics not yet dis­
closed.
Colin Stewart, ’34, captain of the 
football varsity, will talk to the 
students about the team and about 
the school spirit and interest Car­
negie has always shown in college 
athletics. Clarence Overend, grad­
uate manager, will also address the 
students In regard to the. year’s 
athletic schedule.
Both the Drama Department, and 
the Music Department are co-oper­
ating with Clarence Y. I-Inys. '35. 
chairman of the committee in 
charge of the assembly, to make 
the program entertaining and suc­
cessful. Students of the Depart­
ment of Music have arranged for 
a trio, composed of a violin, cello, 
and piano, to furnish musical sub­
jects. The Drama Department will 
feature several short skits.
The committee in charge has se­
lected the Carnegie Music Hall for 
the assembly because this meeting 
is the largest and one of the most 
interesting presented all year. 
Students and faculty members 
alike are requested and urged to 
attend.
Ball to Feature 
Carnegie Guild’s 
Charity Program
The Carnegie Guild will sponsor 
a Charity Ball on October 20 as 
the outstanding feature of their 
year’s activity on campus. The 
Ball, will be held in Thistle Hall 
and will be. strictly formal. Pre­
sale tickets are to be sold at $1.50. 
A detailed announcement concern­
ing the bands being considered 
will be made in the near future.
Nothing of this sort has pre­
viously been attempted on the Car­
negie campus. All proceeds of the 
Charity Ball will go toward the 
philanthropic activities of the or­
ganization. The committee work­
ing on the plans for the ball in­
cludes Virginia Cooper, president 
of Guild, general chairman; Mar­
garet Barr, tickets; Rosemarie 
Grentzer, publicity; Drabelle Mac­
Donald, orchestra; Beatrice Arch­
er, posters; and Mary Davies, 
patrons.
The annual drive of the Guild 
will be held this year on October 3 
and 4. Instead of the usual price 
of twenty-five cents for tags, the 
donation will be optional. For in 
this way it is hoped that more stu­
dents will feel able to contribute 
to the Guild fund. Tags will be 
sold in all colleges. Tables will be 
in the halls of Arts school and Ad­
ministration Hall and students 
will make contacts with members 
of their departments.
Y.W.C.A. to Sponsor 
Big-Little Sister Tea
The Annual Big and Little Sister 
Tea sponsored by the Y. W. C. A. 
will be held October 4 in Margaret 
Morrision Recreation Hall. All 
freshman women are invited to 
come.
This affords the freshman 
women an opportunity to get bet 
ter acquainted with upperclass 
women. Girls who have not yet 
met their Little Sisters are re­
quest to see them and escort them 
to the tea.
Freshmen who have not receiv­
ed Big Sisters are advised to com­
municate with Peggy Smith, vice 
president of YWCA and chairman 
of the Big and Little Sister Move­
ment.
Carnegie’s Grading System 
In Line With That 
Of Other Colleges
By action of the Educational 
Senate, the grade E has been elim­
inated from the Carnegie grading 
system. This change will go into 
effect this year, when' the only 
passing grades will be A, B, C, and
D. The grades below passing—F, 
R, and I—will remain unchanged.
A redistribution of quality points 
will also be made this year. Under 
the new plan the A grade will 
carry four quality points; B, three;
C. two; and D, one. F, 11, and 1 
grades will carry no quality points. 
The F grade, which now carries 
no quality points, is still the grade 
given if a reexamination Is deemed 
necessary by members of the fac­
ulty.
The change was made primarily 
to bring Carnegie’s grading system 
in line with that used by other 
colleges and to afford an oqual 
basis for comparison.
The dropping of the E grade has 
been discussed by the Educational 
Senate for the past two years. 
No action was taken, however, un­
til a committee of the College of 
Engineering made the recommen­
dation. The Senate committee on 
Examinations and the marking 
system which presented the recom­
mendation is composed of Profes­
sors Gustafson, Cranna, Estep, 
Readio, and Rosenbach.
Tartan Positions 
Open to Freshmen
Freshmen interested In pub­
lication work should report at 
the Tartan office, locatod on the 
first floor at the lower end of 
the College of Industries, at 4 
Thursday afternoon. Candi­
dates will be Interviewed and if 
successful, enrolled for basic 
training in the Tartan school for 
reporters.
Tartan work leads to salaried 
positions In the senior year and 
keys for two and four years' 
service.

Drama Schedule 
Calls lor Many 
New Attractions
The Department of Drama has 
announced a complete schedule of 
productions for the coming school 
year which calls for >64 perform­
ances in the Little Theater, in the 
College of Fine Arts, and 14 per­
formances in the Studio Theater, 
In the Union. These perform­
ances, which will involve the stag­
ing of 10 major productions and 
more than 50 one-act plays, will, 
according to an estimate of the 
Drama Department, attract a com­
bined audience of twenty-five to 
thirty thousand people.
The first play of the season will 
be “The Field God" by Paul 
Green, the playwright who is per­
haps the greatest produced by the 
Carolina Playmakers. The first 
performance wilt be given on Oc­
tober 27. “The Field God” is a 
stirring and beautiful tragedy in 
which a North Carolina farmer 
struggles to see his way clear 
through a tragic situation. The 
play is full of proetry and local col-
An unusual departure this year is 
that Mr. B. Iden Payne, visiting di- 
Vector. will produce two Shakespe- 
riah plays instead of one, and both1 
will be given in the second semes­
ter. First will come a production 
of the "Comedy of Errors,” to bo 
followed in nine days by the first, 
part ot "Henry IV.” These will be 
the only productions staged by Mr, 
Payne this year.
An interesting feature of the de­
partment’s schedule, and one sel­
dom appreciated by those unac 
quainted with Its functioning, is 
that the entire season's plays are 
chosen and the opening and clos­
ing dates for them are fixed be­
fore the school year is begun, and 
that those particular plays open 
and close on the days set and not 
on any others. Very often to ad­
here to this strict schedule neces­
sitates long hours and a great deal 
of concentrated effort to properly 
mount the next production. Tnls 
rigid routine, however, Is respon­
sible for the reproduction in a 
school of many elements and con­
ditions often present In profes­
sional work where speed plus, Skill 
are needed to get a commercial 
show on its way on time.

Freshman Registration 
Slightly Under That 
Of Last Year
501 PLEBES ENTER; 
SCHOOL AIDS MAIN Y
Engineering,Industries Show 
Gain; Fine Arts Totals 
Below Last Year
That there will be little change 
in the total enrollment in day 
classes at Carnegie for the now 
semester was the prediction of 
Alan Bright, Registrar, Saturday at 
the close of registration.
Enrollment on Friday and Satur­
day of last week totaled 501 while 
for a comparable period last fall 
the count was 550. Using these 
figures and inquiries received from 
upperclassmen during the summer 
as a basis, Mr. Bright estimated 
that any reduction in enrollment 
would not exceed ten per cent of 
last year’s figure.
Not until tho registration of up­
perclassmen in progress yesterday 
and today is completed will figures 
be available with which to check 
thre total enrollment of previous 
years.
The relatively small decrease in 
enrollment when a larger cut might 
reasonably bo expected, may bo 
attributed to a combination of cir­
cumstances. In many cases sacri­
fices are .being made by students 
in a determined effort to return to 
school. The administration has ex­
tended aid to many students 
through the oillco of tho Doans of 
Mon and Women, Furthermore, 
among tho freshmen are many who 
would In normal times have gone- 
out of town to school but because 
of financial difficulties are forced 
to attend a Pittsburgh Institution 
this year.
Last, week's enrollment of 50'f. 
was divided as follows: Colleges
of Engineering and Industries, 250; 
College of Pino Arts, 125; and Mar­
garet Morrison College, ;i,2(l.
For a. comparable period last 
year the totals were: Col legos of
lflnglnoorlng and Industries, 2-18; 
College of I1’!no Arts, 155; and Mar­
garet Morrison College, 147.
Registration of late arrivals and 
of I.!lose, completing financial ar­
rangements Is expected to he ex­
ceptionally large this your and will 
probably greatly Increase tho 
freshman total for each college. 
Already the enrollment for tho 
Colleges of Engineering and Indus- 
trlos has reached last year's figure 
bill, that In the College of Fine Arts 
and M. M. <!. C. Is far below, tho 
College of Fine Arts being tho­
rn oil I; disappointing.
The largest, enrollment In Car- 
noglo's history was In the I'alt 
semester of I IK! I when 2,521 stu­
dents registered for day classes. 
The registration figures for last* 
fall were 2,855.

Gigantic Projects Built in Miniature 
For Study in Hydraulic Laboratory
By William H. Sharp
The largest splash in history oc­
curred when the eleven thousand- 
ton obelisk dam, built in an up­
right position, was toppled into the 
Saguenay river in Quebec, Canada, 
to complete one of the most spec­
tacular feats ever accomplished by 
engineers. This huge mass of 
concrete came to rest within an 
inch of the predicted position and 
effectively dammed the river.
Tills gigantic monolith was the 
prototype of numerous small con­
crete obelisks which were tumbled 
into a model river in tho hyraulic 
research laboratory. Here In the 
basement of Engineering Hall nu­
merous tests wore made to deter­
mine the cushioning effect of tho 
water, the effect of the current, 
and the shattering effect on the 
obelhih Itself. Here also have 
been tested models of various 
other engineering projects. In all 
of thorn some previously undeter­
mined phase of hydraulics was 
studied by the use of models and 
recommendations made which re­
sulted in savings of large sums of 
money in actual construction work.
Hydraulic experimentation by 
means of models Is rapidly gain­
ing favor with engineers in the 
United States. Germany led the 
way In this field—Indeed, It was a 
German, Theodore Rehbock, who 
gave the first impetus to model 
testing in this country. Hydraulic 
model laboratories have been es- 
I tablished at a number of American
universities. Of these the Car­
negie laboratory rates among the 
first four. It was established five 
years ago with the help of a con­
tribution from tho Aluminum Com­
pany of America and has since 
been used in several tests on hy­
draulic structures designed by tho 
engineers of tills company. It is 
supervised by Prof. Harold A. 
Thomas, professor of hydraulic and 
sanitary engineering.
Experimentation with modelB 1« 
the main feature of the work of 
this laboratory. Models are used 
to determine unpredictable effects 
of water on dams, piers, and spill­
ways and to discover what meth­
ods of construction will produce 
certain desirable effects.
Since Its installation the labora­
tory has been used to test fivo 
major projects, and a sixth Is now 
nearing completion. Each project 
requires from five to eight months 
of careful ronoarch and observa­
tion. By tho use of a. large three- 
dimensional pantograph each model 
In carefully reproduced from bluo 
prints of the actual ground loca­
tion. Moving pictures and photo­
graph» are made In connection 
with all the experiments and rep­
resent an important aspect of the 
work. The photography is done 
by Mr. Lawrence II. Miller, super­
intendent of equipment at Car­
negie.The first large model to be test­
ed at the laboratory represented

Twenty-two students liavo boon 
cited for honor on the basis of 
grades received during the sum­
mer session, Professor R. B. 
Leighou, director, has announced. 
This numbor represents twenty- 
four per cent of the ninety-two in 
attendance who carried a rull-tlmo 
schedule, defined as 18 or more 
units for the six week session or 
24 units for eight weeks. The 
complete summer session enroll­
ment totaled 582, a decrease of ap­
proximately seventeen per cent 
from last summer’s registration of 
710. Those carrying a full-time 
schedule last year totaled 105.
Among teachers from other col- . 
leges taking summer work was 
Lieutenant William A. Buglier, in­
structor in drawing and descrip­
tive geometry at West Point, Lieu­
tenant Bugher took work in the 
department, of painting and dec­
oration. Colonel Alexander, head 
of the West Point department of 
drawing; studied methods used in 
teaching drawing here.
Another university instructor In 
attendance was Mr. Frederick G. 
Surt/.is of the department of me? 
chanical engineering at Cornoll 
University who studied with Dr. 
Max Frocht in the graduate photo- 
elasticity laboratory.
A notable success In tho sum­
mer session was scored by Profes­
sor M. .T. Luvaas, head of the de­
partment of music at Allegheny. 
College, who, as visiting professor, 
was an instructor in ensemble, 
harmony, and choral technique. 
At the recital, given by dopartmont 
of music students on the Hotel

numbers of a cappolla music di­

Excitement Is 
Promised For 
Pigskin Fans
Schedule Is Hardest In 
Years, But Tartans 
Well Prepared
reJu growing- preHtlfie of the Tar­
tan plgukln BCiUttd dy being proven 
by the lncreaBlng dlfilculty of the 
Plaid flcheduie. Thin yoar the Car­
negie team will bo nut to the 
BevoroBt tost ever encountered In 
It» hl»tory. The »ea»on differ» gen-j 
orally from prevlou» one» In that 
there 1» only one breather. The 
Plaid boy» will probably buck 
three of tho livo best team» In the 
country during their campaign: 
Pitt, Purdue and Notre Dame. 
Tlieae are representative of tho 
bout teams In the East and Middle 
West and are out to beat tho Tar­
tan grlddorfl. If the Carnegie lad» 
take over three of the nine teams 
scheduled they will have acquitted 
themselves well. However, the boys 
are out to clean up tills year and 
are guaranteeing a close light In 
every contest.
The llrst big test will come In 
the first game with Temple. The 
Owl grid dor» are looming a» one 
of tho football powers of the East. 
They boast a big team that will 
easily outweigh the Plaid and they 
have the famous "Pop” Warner as 
their new coach. It 1» their first 
real game and the Temple boys 
will be anxious to prove their met­
tle. A good battle may bo expected 
hut the Tartan grldders are given 
an oven chance to come out on 
top.
Xavier is not the hardest game 
on the schedule, but It may al­
ways be depended upon for a good 
fight. However the Carnegie lads 
should top them easily and Im­
pressively. The Tartan grldders 
may benefit by this easier game 
here as the third game is with 
the famous fighting Irish. Notre 
Dame will probably present another 
fine team to redeem their lost 
laurels In the football world. The 
Plaid Is one of their first big tests 
and they will be set to, take the 
Pittsburgh boys. I-Iarpster, how­
ever, 1b also pointing for this game 
and Is anxious to repeat his pre­
vious upset. One thing that can 
bo depended on. tills yoar is that 
the score will not be a top heavy 
one. A. victory over Notre Dame 
would put the Tartan lad« up and 
ill there for the National cham­
pionship, which is just what they 
want.
W. & .T. is quite a chronic jinx 
with Tech, but barring mishaps the 
Plaid should win In hand. Tills, 
too, ey a hard game to predict, but 
the chances are that the Washing­
ton, Pa„ boys will bo outplayed.
Purduo promises to linvo one of 
tho strongest tenms In the country 
and Is practically Invincible on tho 
homo grounds. Tho Carnegie gi’ld- 
dei’B aro conceded little chance, 
hut win or lose, tho gamo will be 
a tight ono.
Michigan State 1» not so strong 
this season and tho Tartans should 
take them by an appreciable mar­
gin. With tho three tough games 
preceding tills tho Carnegie pig* 
sUIn chasers may find the going n 
little rough, though they aro 
scheduled to take over the Laiui- 
Ing lads.Georgetown at. Washington 1» 
another gamo tho Plaid should tako 
by a wide acoro. They have never 
presented an overly lmpro»slvo op­
position, yu tho Tech boys should 
heap up a victory.
N, Y. U. and Curnoglo aro long 
standing rivals and are very even­
ly matched. Playing on their 
home grounds tho New Yorkers 
usually manage to pull down the 
breaks and win luckily. If tho

SINCE RETURNING TO THIS INSTITUTION LAST WEEK all and 
sundry connected with the field house in any manner have taken plenty 
of time out to Inform me that Carnegie Tcch really has a football team 
this season. Having hoard the same lino of boloney for the past three 
years, I was more than a bit skeptical about all this enthusiasm. In 
1930 and again in 1932 tho squad was reputed to have the goods, but 
both timos they folded up llko a one-man tent.
On giving this year's edition tho double "O" last wook, though, I 
am practically convlncod that they aro going places this tlmo. For the 
first time in several years Interference Is actually forming and setting 
the opposition’s secondary down very rudely. The line is opening up 
holes big enough to run a train of cars through; and tho onds-appa­
rently arc defying the laws of gravity to snare difficult passes. On the 
defense the team looks especially good, for tho freshmen can't seem 
to get as far as the lino of ocrlmmauo In most cases.
From good sourcos I am told that the spirit of the team In general 
Is very high this season. Lads who were reported to be “dogging" it 
last yoar act ac if they had boon fed raw moat, and tho lazier members 
aro showing consldorablo lifo.******
WHATEVER PROBLEMS COACH HARPSTER MAY BE PACING 
THIS PALL he certainly shouldn't kick about tho scarcity of material. 
Ho has at least two first class players for each position, and the com­
petition for each post seems,to bo very keen. Not more than four of 
the first string look to bo sure of tlioir jobs.
The return of Lib Lewis to tho squad was an especially good piece 
of luck In view of tho ineligibility of Ray Teaser, last year’s right 
end. IC thero were any doubts about Lewis' ability to come back after 
Ills unfortunate accident two yoars ago, they should be dispelled after 
watching tho Washington, Pa., lad work out this fall. Tesser Incident­
ally Is playing pro ball for the Pittsburgh Pirates this year.
The fact that there is so much competition for each berth Is a 
good sign, for the schedule this year is going to demand a number of 
good reserves. Carnegie’s chances of stopping tho big teams that are 
being put out, by Purdue, NoLro Dame, Pitt, and Michigan State this 
season deponds a great deal upon having a great number or good sub­
stitutes to throw into tho game when the first string begins to tire 
under the pounding of their hea.vler opponents.******
JUDGE WALTER P. STEFFEN, WHO RETIRED FROM ACTIVE 
COACHING LAST YEAR, was In town over the week-end to sco b°w 
his disciple, Howard Harpster, was making out down here. He empha­
sized tho fact that this year's schedule, although extremely tough, was 
arrangod in a manner very favorable to Carnegie Tech. On considering 
the matter, ono can easily soe that this Is quite true. Temple, with a 
big green team, will not reach top form until late In the season and 
therefore is handicapped In meeting Carnegie so early in the year. 
Notro Dame is also a slow team In developing, nnd they will be labor­
ing under tho handicap of being top-heavy favorites to massacre the 
Pittsburghers. Purdue will have an especially hard time downing the 
Harpstermen, for they faco tho Plaid warriors just one week after their 
encounter with Notre Damo. Michigan State will bo at a disadvantage 
Inasmuch as they have never played against a team employing the 
Stoflcn system before, whilo Tech is more than Just familiar with the 
Rockne system, which tho Lansing team employs. New York U. looks 
too weak this yoar to stop the Tartans in spite of tholr apparent jinx 
over us, but In the Pitt gamo It. will be the Sklbos themselves who will 
have the two called strikes on them. The annual classic comes just 
five days after the N. Y. U. game, and anyone knows that that Is not 
sufficient rest for a team who has played such an extremely tough 
schedule. Pitt, though, will still be breathing hard from their battle 
with the powerful Nebraska CornhU3kers.
Judge Steffen also said that ho was more than pleased with the 
way tho team was blocking. Ho emphasized the fact that all the really 
great teams In past years have boon marvoious blockers.******
CARNEGIE GRIDIRON ENTHUSIASTS WILL WATCH TWO GAMES 
with particular intorost this coming Saturday. Those aro tho PItt-W.
& J. battle and tho Tomplo-South Carolina struggle. Thero was a time 
when the PItt-W. & .T. game was ono of the biggest gamoB in the oast, 
but of late the Prexlos linvo Blink lower and lower in tho scale. Pew 
will give Hanlc Day’s crow more than an outside chance to stop the 
Sutherland machine, but it will he interesting to watch tills game, for 
the Tartans moot both those outfits later In the season.
South Carolina should bo no more than a breeze for tho Owls, but 
iI, .will give the Carnegie scouts a good opportunity to look over tho 
posalblllfloa of tho Philadelphia team. Carnegie moots Temple the fol­
lowing week, and according to the Now York Times, Warner I» especi­
ally anxious to make a good showing here, as ho was with the Pit I 
team for a numbor of years. "Pop” brought Ills Stanford, team hero 
last, year, but they made a very miserable showing against tho Pan­

After deliberation the Carnegie 
Athletic Association has decided to 
continue competition in cross coun­
try running. Last year the Tar­
tan field trotters won two of the 
five scheduled meets, obtaining vic­
tories over West Virginia and New 
York University. They lost to 
Geneva, Westminster and Pitt.
Coach Guy Ilalferty has arranged 
an attractive schedule for the Tech 
harriers in this season’s cross coun­
try competition. His schedule 
shows five meets, beginning Octo­
ber 21 with a meet against Notre 
Dame, and ending November 25. 
The meets will be with Notre 
Dame, Geneva, Westminster, Pitt 
and West Virginia. It is possible 
that Westminster will not have a 
cross country team tills season, but 
the meet is scheduled in hopes that 
the Tartan harriers may make up 
for the loss they suffered in that 
quarter last year.
The cross country team is cap­
tained by Shorey Allen, and con­
sists of Allen, Schell, Giolma, 
Burke, Blair and Ramsey. Schell 
Is under the burden of a difficult 
schedule this year, but it is hoped 
that he will find time to continue 
development of the brilliant run­
ning career he has shown in the 
past. Although Ramsey is not cer­
tain to return to school this year, 
Coach Ilalferty is expecting him 
to show up for registration and 
later for cross country practice.
The schedule of cross country 
meets is as follows:
October 21—Notre Dame, here.
October 27—Geneva, there.
November 4—Westminster, there.
November 10—Pitt, here.
November 25 — West Virginia, 
there.

Whether tdio strives to keep that 
slim figure or indulges in a Mae 
West, every girl needs some ex­
ercise and fun. The Women’s Ath­
letic Association fills that néed. 
When the tuition is paid, each girl 
automatically becomes a member 
of W. A. A. and has the right to 
participate in all of its activities 
and to use its equipment. A girl 
need not excel in a sport to come 
out for it, because instruction and 
advice are freely given. The thing 
to do is to choose a sport and come 
to the practices every time. Ad­
vance notice of practices is posted 
and the periods selected to fit in 
as well as possible with all sched­
ules.
Each sport has a manager who 
has a position on the W. A. A. 
board. The manager gives instruc­
tion, plans the periods in coopera­
tion with the physical education 
teachers and determines who de­
serves award points at the end of 
the season. Sports include archery, 
basket ball, bowling, hockey, hik­
ing, tennis, rifle, swimming, speed 
ball and volley ball. In addition 
to these, the W. A. A. gives mixed 
swimming parties and award par­
ties for the girls.
The hockey season, under the 
direction of Maude Bowers, begins 
in October.

Student Employment 
Shows Improvement
A slight change for the better 
has been noticed in the employ­
ment situation this past summer, 
according to Mr. Beatty. About 
forty per cent of the graduating 
class have been placed in their 
respective fields, while others have 
found employment in various 
other fields. The summer employ­
ment was better than anticipated.
The employment Bureau is mak­
ing every effort to secure employ­
ment for students and predicts 
that the pick-up will be gradual. 
The Bureau is endeavoring to aid 
all alumni through such mediums 
as salesmanship lectures to better 
their positions in their respective 
fields. It has also agreed to in­
form graduates of business condi­
tions.
Miss Merrill, who handled the 
summer employement, requests 
that all those who had summer 
jobs to report to her in the very 
near future.
The Women’s Athletic Associa­
tion welcomed the freshman wom­
en to campus last Saturday after­
noon with a play day under the 
guidance of Eleanor Sherman. Un­
fortunately rain spoiled the plans 
for sports on the Cut and drove 
the ninety freshmen who attended 
to basket ball, volley ball and other 
games inside the gym. It was an 
introduction, however, to the type 
of thing W. A. A. does and, inei- 
dently, to an invigorating, cold 
after-sliower.
ON THE one hundred and fifty-seventh anniversary of the Battle of Con­cord, a shot was actually heard round the world. Fired from a musket used in that battle, ic was broadcast round the world from General Electric’s 
short-wave radio station.
The sound of the shot made the 24,000-mile loop in one-eighth of a second, and on its return was loud enough to be rebroadcast over the longer waves of sta­
tion WGY. To do this, the sound was sent out from station W2XAD, on 19-56 meters, to Holland, where it was relayed to Java, which in turn rebroadcast 
it to Australia, where it was relayed back to Schenectady, being received on 
28.5 meters.
This dramatization of Emerson’s lines was made possible because of research and developments in the electrical industry — developments that are largely 
the work of college-trained engineers. They are leading the way to even greater progress and are helping to maintain General Electric’s leadership in 
the electrical industry.
95-952FBI
Tartans can overcome this jinx 
they should he good for a victory 
by a slight margin.
Pitt Is again slated to take Tech, 
but In this game anything may 
happen and no ono dares try to 
predict either way. This is tho big 
game and the season will be a yangi 
cess If we boat Pitt, regardless^.of 
tho outcome of tho other gam.es.

the Calderwood Dam on the Little 
Tennessee River at Calderwood, 
Tennessee. The work was done 
by the engineers of the Aluminum 
Company of America with the as­
sistance of Profesor Thomas and 
several students. The purpose of 
the experiment was to study the 
effect of a "cushion pool” at the 
base of the dam. The pool was 
created by a small dam immediate­
ly down stream from the main 
dam. Its purpose was to absorb 
the energy of the water from the 
spillway. By experiments on. the 
model, the proper location of the 
cushion dam was determined and 
the engineers were enabled to car­
ry on the actual construction with 
the assurance ' that the desired 
cushioning would result.
The second model was a repro­
duction of the Chute a Caron, or 
Shipshaw, dam and power house 
on the Saguenay River in Quebec, 
Canada. It afforded an opportu­
nity to study the adequacy of a 
large wall which was to protect the 
power house from flooding by 
spray from the dam. By the ex- 
pei*iments on the model the prop­
er location and design of the wall 
was easily determined.
The Electric Bond and Share 
Company furnished the next prob­
lem. that of the spillway of the 
Ariel Dam on the Lewis River in 
the state of Washington. The 
model was used to study the ac­
tion of the water as it flowed from 
the spillway across a rock ledge 
and dropped sixty feet into the 
river. Improper construction of 
the spillway would cause the 
power house to become clogged 
with gravel. By the use of the 
model the method of eliminating 
this objectionable consequence was 
discovered. A feature of this ex­
periment was the suggestion of a 
Carnegie student which caused an 
important change in the spillway 
design.
The model now in the laboratory 
is that of the Flathead Dam on the 
Platliead River in northwestern 
Montana. It was constructed in or­
der to determine the proper de­
sign of a deflector to prevent ero­
sion of the rock at the base of 
the dam.
At the present time a model of 
the Monongahela River in the vi­
cinity of Lock No. 4 (near Char­
leroi, Pa.) is laid out on the lab­
oratory floor. It was built in or­
der to study methods of reducing 
dangerously swift currents which 
occur in the river above the lock 
during high water stages. Hun­
dreds of tests are being made to 
determline the effect of widening

DISBURSEMENTSOctober 1, 2 and 3 will find night 
students registering once more for 
another year of evening classes.; 
One week from now and our vaca­
tion will be over and a new life 
will begin. No doubt a great many 
of us are ready by this time to once 
more take up the march toward 
that degree or certificate that we 
are striving for, but a great many 
others due to unfortunate circum­
stances, will be forced to remain 
away.
The recent pickup in industry 
has been of great help to a large 
number of night students, but after 
the long period of inactivity, it is 
still questionable whether some 
will be able to spare the necessary 
tuition fee again this year. How­
ever, if past performances means 
anything, we can look forward to 
seeing some enterprising night 
students pawning the family jew­
els, if they still have any, so that 
they can return once more to their 
studies.
New courses of study have been 
added, as no doubt you already 
know. Other changes and addi­
tions to the teaching staff, together 
with the industrial recovery, will 
no doubt mean an increase in the 
total registration this year over 
last. All of which means that a 
lot of acquaintances that have 
been temporarily discontinued dur­
ing the summer will soon be re­
newed.

Copyright. 1033. The Americas Tobacco Comparu.
Why do wc say “Always Luckies Please”? 
Well, one reason is that every Lucky is 
made of choice, ripe tobaccos—the Cream 
of the Crop. Another reason—Luckies 
are always round, firm, fully packed— 
with no loose ends to sputter and spark.
Careful examination and inspection by 
over 60 precision instruments and 17 alert 
scientists guarantee unfailing uniformity. 
That’s why Luckies draw so easily, burn 
so evenly—always mild and smooth. And 
that’s why — “Always Luckies Please!”
it's toasted ”
FOR THROAT PROTECTION-FOR BETTER TASTE
i You are right. It won’t be long 
until the night gates are flung open 
land wide to those of us who are 
Iseeking to advance along the road 
of success. Only a few days re- 
: I main of that long summer vacation 
which started last May. Soon we’ll 
be back again at the old familiar 
camping ground ready to continue 
the parade of progress.
You are right again, for the reg­
istration period for night students 
will begin on October second and 
continue for three days so that all 
those who have a mind to get in the 
parade of progress may be regis­
tered for some course or another, 
or sumpin.
And again, you are right, for the 
scribbling of an idle night student, 
the successor of those idle night 
students of previous years, are be­
ing submitted to the Plaid Editor. 
If the initial efforts of this humble 
scribe merits the consideration of 
the editor and they are published 
it shall be taken that they are to 
he continued throughout the year.
It is rather difficult to take up 
broken strands where another has 
left off, particularly when the work 
has. been done so well, but it is my 
hope that the night students, and 
all the readers of the Carnegie 
Tartan, will bear with me a while 
until I. get into the swing of things. 
I am not a Fisher Parry, a IHey- 
wood Broun, or any of those cele­
brities of the pen, merely a night 
student, at least 1 expect to be one 
when the registration period is 
over, but I shall do my part In 
trying to make this year’s Tartan 
the equal of those of previous 
years.
Being away from the campus 
since last May sorta makes one 
rusty, so it will be a trifle hard to 
give correct pictures of the doings 
and what not of Carnegie. I am 
sorta curious to know what 
changes, if any, hare taken place 
since classes closed last semester, 
Guess I’ll have to wait for another 
week and curb my curiosity a bit.
Of course, we’ll still have that old 
parking problem to shoot at and 
who knows but that a solution may 
be found for this .vexing question. 
It is a difficult problem, I'll admit, 
to find space for all those who 
come to Tech at night, but with all 
the talk of public improvements
I one hears about. It would be fine 
if some one would come along and 
erect some sort of a garage for our 
campus cars. This would surely 
solve the parking problem.
It wouldn’t surprise me one bit if, when I return for school to find 
that all doors opened out. You 
know, there are quite a few of 
them which open the other way. 
What has that got to do with 
school, why a whole lot, for in­
stance, in case one finds that an as­
signment is rather difficult, it is 
more convenient to find the door 
opening out in order to escape the 
wrath of—why mention names, you 
all know.
I suppose there will be a large 
»lumber of students who will re­
turn for courses this year, there 
'ayways is, so I won't have any dif­
ficulty in finding things to write 
about after we get started.
Well, about the next thing we 
will read about in the papers is 
that there will be a NRA code for 
night students. Wouldn’t that be 
great? Just think of going to school 
under a code. [Lots of strange 
t things have happened and a code 
for some of the subjects, math for
i instance, would be about the best 
Jthing yet. So cheer up. you math 
[hounds, better things are in store 
for you under the blue eagle.
DIDJA NOTICE
THAT it won't be long now.
THAT, yes. we’re back again, j to torment you with the best 
t column ever written, ahem, but 
¦ not for long, as my successor is
* already instructing his Dr. Wat- 
$ son, and needle, Into the myste- 
: ries of writing a spicy column, 
if THAT it was some summer.
I With 3.2, NRA, and one code 
^ after another, no I haven’t got a
* code In da head, we didn’t dare 
1 fall asleep for fear of being old- 
j fashioned.
THAT one wag remarked 
NRA means “No Registration 
(Fees) Accepted.”
THAT this column will award 
a cream puff measuring 99 
inches in diameter to the best 
pun on the above letters.
THAT it’s a tough job to fill 
this column when there is no 
night school going on, without 
getting personal, and the editor 
said, “Cut out them personali­
ties.''
THAT all them night stu­
dents what has' went back to 
work ain't gonna stay from 
school and are coming back 
somemore. (Editor's note: The 
above explains why the writer 
flunked English last year.)
THAT some of our curious 
Engineers are practicing looking 
through small cracks for the an­
nual sessions at the sculpture 
room window.
THAT our already fine teach­
ing staff has been strengthened 
further by the addition of three 
eminent German scientists.

this year's Greek swimi. And don’t forget to 
gaze at the new Faculty Club Room next time 
you are in back of the Arts School. This is the

the common people, that the professional clique 
often gets what is known as the gravy.

by the editors oJ: the Carnegie Tartan to extend to you a word of wcleome to the Carnegie Institute of Technology. Your 
entering college in probably tile most important step that you 
have taken. ] hope that your expectations and ambitions will 
be fully realized. You have yearn of hard work ahead of you, 
but the members of the faculty will do what they can to jnake 
the work worth while and interesting. Do not hesitate to ask 
their counsel when you find yourself in difficulties. I hope 
that you will feel that there is a spirit of friendliness and help­
fulness here. I shall bo glad to see you at any time that you 
may desire to discuss your problems witli me. Will you not do 
your share towards making this year the most successful in the

The "Big Bosses” swept into town last week 
all set for a busy year. Shorey spent the'sum­
mer in school getting ahead of himself so he can 
devote all of his spare lime to running the stu­

Sam’l is back with a brand new worried look

The Carnegie Clearing House for Unattached 
Undergraduates, better known perhaps as the 
Deans’ Reception, was held in all its unsophisti­

were conspicuous by their absence 'tho whether 
the eagle eyes and restraining hands of Doorman ’ 
Jim Dykes and his self-appointed helper were 
wholly responsible for this social dilemma has 
not been determined.
The most difficult task of the evening was to 
find the Freshmen—and there were plenty of 
them, too—but after the Cwens, Scimitars, Stu­
dent Council Representatives and gate-crashers 
had been sifted through the crowd, little white 
lapel tags were at a premium.

WELCOMEEdmond Esquerre
As wc assemble at; the beginning of another year many of 
ns are: conscious oil a loss that the Institute of Technology and 
tho faculty have sustained. 'Dliere is a gap in our ranks that 
has not been filled, and will not be filled in the life time of 
some of us. The absent one is Professor Esquerre, who passed 
away on June 2, 1933.The editor rtf the Tartan has asked me to contribute a me­
morial note. Nothing that I could write would be more elo­
quent and more appropriate than the letter which was pub­
lished in one of the Pittsburgh papers early lait June. Jt was 
written by my friend, Dr. AvinolT, Director of the Carnegie 
Museum, and I am asking our Tartan editor to reprint this 
bcautirul. tribute.¦ “A beautiful soul passed away. Edmond Esquerre is not 
any more with us—mourned by a host of friends to whom he 
has endeared himsell!. Bui; it is not sorrow alone lie leaves 
with them, liis parting and lasting gift is an intensively liv­
ing imago of his spirt: kindly, mellow, lofty and serene.
“Born in ’Franco, Edmond Esquerre spent a 11 his life, since 
early youlli, in tho new world to which he brought tho finest 
tribute, of the Latin, race—tho refinement of a gentleman ol! tho 
old school, a sparkling brilliancy, wit and vivacity- in a word, 
all that wliioh. no English torm is adequately able to translate, 
and that which in French is designated as ‘esprit’.
“For over 2(5 years Professor ol! the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, he was beloved by his students who recognized in 
him, as did nil liis friends, the commanding trait ol! his person­
ality- ^compassion. Abovo all his mental achievements, his in­
exhaustible analytical ingenuity, his versatile intellectuality ol! 
a polished, cultivated mind, was his eonsidorate sympathetic 
understanding; outshining all was this compassion - -simple, 
sterling and supremo,
“His whole life seems to be epitomized in one word, misori- 
oordia. A truly enlightened Christian soul, he was prepared 
to answer the oall ol! his Maker. And now his friends can say 
ol! him Mulfca pars vitabit.”
I should 1 iIce *to‘ add, that no one who was associated with 
Mr. Esquerro during the quarter ol’ a century ol! his work at 
tin'. Institute ol! Technology could have failed to appreciate the 
kind lines» and generosity ol! his nature. The longer I knew 
him, the more I admired, him, the more I valued his friendship 
and tho beautiful iuflueneo that lie exertod throughout our 
Institute.THOMAS S. BATvEH,
President.

pened to be wearing liis bartender smile. In any

THE ANSWER IS VERY SIMPLE:
Germany’s Loss; Carnegie’s Gain
Carnegie is glad to welcomc to its campus three noted 
scientists driven from German halls of learning by Nazi op­
pression. President Baker, during his recent European trip, 
induced the trio, to come to Pittsburgh and continue their work 
at Carnegie.The three, Professors Otto Stern, I. Estermann, and Ernst 
Berl, all distinguished research workers, will teach in addition 
to conducting their research study.
Professor Stern and his assistant, Professor Estermann, ex­
perimental physicists, will assume charge of a new research lab­
oratory to be established by the department of physics. They 
will continue their study of molecular structure, aided in this 
by the use of molecular beams, developed by Professor Stern as 
a tool in his research.
Professor Berl, already on the campus, is noted through­
out Europe as a chemist and was formerly head of the institute 
of physical chemistry at the University of Hamburg. He is an 
expert in the field of fuel technology and has contributed sev­
eral papers to Carnegie international coal conferences. Dur­
ing the World War ho was chief chemist for the Austro-Hun­
garian war ministry. Professor Berl will conduct his work here 
in tho coal research laboratory.
And to President Baker-—congratulations for these bril­
liant, additions to an already brilliant faculty.
Wc trust this association of Old World scientist and a mod­
ern American technical inslitution will lie profitable mutually.

OBACCOS to taste right in a 
cigarette need to be flavored or 
seasoned just the same as you might 
season a steak or a pudding.
No tobaccos have ever been found 
that equal the spicy aromatic tobac­
cos of Turkey and Greece for this 
purpose. That’s why we send 4000 
miles for aromatic tobaccos from Sam- 
soun and Smyrna,Xanthi and Cavalla.
When blended and cross-blended 
in just the right amounts with Chest­
erfield’s mild ripe Domestic tobac­
cos, the result is a rich flavor and a 
fine fragrance.
Chesterfields are seasoned right— 
they taste right. May we ‘suggest 
you try them.
