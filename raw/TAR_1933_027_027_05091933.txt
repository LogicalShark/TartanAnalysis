Public Characters Will Go “Over the Coals” 
Spring Carnival Shoiv to Be Given Friday 
And Saturday at Pitt Theater
The Bacchanalians, producers of 
the annual Spring Carnival show, 
were organized by William Beal, 
Franklin Heller, Herman Live- 
right, and other students in the 
Department of Drama In 1932. The 
group felt that Carnegie, like many 
other colleges in the country, 
should present an annual musical 
show. Their plan was to present 
an unusual type of show for a col­
lege—a musical revue. The cast 
was to include both men and wo­
men, and its manner was to be 
satirical and sophisticated.
The first production was en­
titled, “Tar and Feathers,” because 
it satirized many well-known per­
sons and institutions, such as the 
radio, Richard Halliburton, Ben 
Bernie, Walter Wincliell, and the 
Carnegie International Exhibition 
of Paintings.
In “Over the Coals”—The Bac­
chanalians’ second production — 
the same attitude has been main­
tained, not only in the title but
also in the substance. This year, 
ex-President Hoover, Ed Wynn, 
the Blue Laws, and the three Bar­
rymores come in for their share of 
satirizing.
“Over the Coals”—like “Tar and 
Feathers” — is entirely student 
written, directed, and acted. The 
dancing is under the direction of 
Bill Bales ’34, a Drama student 
who maintains a dancing school in 
Carnegie, Pa., during his spare 
time. Music for the show has 
been orchestrated by John Dippold 
’34, Chancey Kelly ’33, and Georgo 
Youngling ’33 of the Department 
of Music. They have also written 
several of the numbers. Addition­
al music has been written by other, 
members of the student body.
Others who are instrumental in 
putting on the show are: William 
Behrse ’34, technical director; De- 
Lisle Crawford ’35, scenic director, 
and Emanual Breakstone ’33, who 
Is directing the singing. All are

of the organization. Pi Delta Epsi­
lon, journalistic honorary for men,

of notification to officers whenever 
funds are overdrawn. A system

tion is kept by the recording of all 
requisitions for the assurance of 
the members that the funds are be­

The Carl Schurz Memorial Foun­

ing countries under whose aus- 
plces Dr. Baker recently spoke In 
Germany, is sponsoring Max Mon­
tor, Viennese actor, who will give 
a dramatic recital in the Little 
Theater of the College of Fine 
Arts tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 
for students and tomorrow evening 
at 8:15 o’clock for the public.
Mr. Montor is internationally 
known for his unusual interpreta­
tions of drama and poetry. He 
was horn in Vienna and studied 
for the stage at the Imperial Con­
servatory of Dramatic Art in his 
native city. He made his debut in 
Zurich, Switzerland, as Meplilsto- 
pheles in "Faust," and followed 
this with extensive tours through 
Austria, Germany and Switzerland, 
with long engagements at Ham­
burg, Munich and Berlin. He has 
impersonated over six hundred 
characters, two-thirds of which 
were star parts.
The American career of Mr. 
Montor began nine year« ago. He 
has appeared on Broadway in 
Strindberg’s "Dance of Death," in 
Ibsen's "Rosmersholm.” opposite 
Eva LeGallienne in Ibsen's "The 
Master Builder,” with Waiter 
Hampden In "Hamlet." In the 
Philadelphia Metropolitan Opera 
House in Schiller’s "The Robbers," 
in Los Angeles in "Merchant of 
Venice," in Sudermann’s "Magda,” 
and recently in Elmer Rice’s 
“Street scene."
An unusual desire to interpret a 
character of a drama, the urge' to 
live the ' complete drama of hln 
own conception and to have his 
audience live it with him, led Max 
Montor to the rostrom of the dra­
matic reader.
As a tentative program in his 
afternoon lecture, Mr. Montor 
plans to relate some of his expe­
riences with Herman Sudermann 
and to give a reading of the hit­
ter’s little masterpiece, "Frltehon."
In his evening program Mr. Mon­
tor is considering the presentation 
of some sconen from "The As­
sumption of Hannelo Mattern” by 
Hauptmann; "Tolerance Better 
'Phan Hatred" by Hauptmann; se­

“Over the Coals," the. Spring Carnival Revue, will be presented 
by the Bacchanalians Friday and Saturday evenings at the Pitt Thea­
ter. The production this year consists of a variety of sketches and 
musical numbers rather than the usual college musical show.
Although members of the cast and choruses have spent many long 
and weary hours practicing for the Revue the photographer seems to 
have discovered some of them who don't mind the hard work.
In the upper left picture, Sue Clark ’36, perched high upon a piano., 
is telling James McNaughton ’36 how to play the musical scores com­
posed by some of the Bacchanalians. In the picture at the top center 
are five girls of the chorus. From left to right: Sue Bennett '34, Betty 
Frost '34, Betty Fouche '35, Mary Anne Miller '35. and Laura Colucci 
'35. At the right is Patti Littell '35, who does a solo dance in the 
Revue. In the lower center picture, Louise Amsler ’35, is shown 
measuring Viola Sayles '35 for a costume.

year’s event they are to be mod­
ern.
There will be lighting effects in 
both Thistle Hall and the Gymna­
sium. In the latter, colored lights- 
will play on a water fountain at 
one end, and in the other the dec­
orations will feature a large crystal 
ball. Emblems from all the campus- 
social fraternities are to be hung 
around the walls. Colored crepe 
paper will be used to decorate- 
Thistle Hall.
OnNFriday morning at 11 o’clock. 
the starter’s gun will send off the:- 
pushmobiles in the preliminary 
race of the interfraternity sweep­
stakes. This spectacle with its. 
thrills and humorous situations^ 
has always been a popular one for 
the students. In the afternoon at 
1 o’clock comes the parade of the 
lloats in -which campus groups vie. 
with each other to produce the in­
genious hilarious floats. This hey­
day parade was an innovation last 
year, and was so successful that it 
is to be repeated this year.
From 2 o'clock on, the faculty- 
and seniors will oppose each 
other, first in a mushball game, and. 
then in a tennis match at three- 
o'clock. For the mushball game 
there is an array of talent on the.- 
faculty which guarantees adequate 
reserves.
The Costume Ball, scheduled 
from -9 to 1 o'clock in the Gymna­
sium will conclude the day’s activ­
ities. The same orchestras which 
play at the Coronation Ball are to 
perform at this colorful event. The- 
same decorations will be used for 
this affair as for the Coronation 
Ball.
The Reserve Officers Training: 
Corps are to hold their annual Re­
view in honor of Dr. Baker, Satur­
day morning at 10 o’clock; this, 
formal. parade will be followed an. 
hour later by the Sweepstakes- 
finals. From 2 to. 4 in the after­
noon the campus lionoraries wilL 
make their calls at the Sylvan The­
ater behind the Arts School. At 
this time Miss Wholey will an­
nounce winners and award cups; 
for the various competitions dur­
ing the carnivals. The “Welding: 
of the Link” will conclude the aft­
ernoon. In case of inclement 
weather the Qualification Ceremon­
ies will be held in the Gymnasium-
The musical revue, “Over the-

The General Faculty is an organ­
ization formed to provide a formal 
method of expressing, through suit­
able legislative action, its desire 
and opinion on any matter pertain-

The Delta Tail Delta fraternity 
won the Carnegie Interl’raternlty 
Debating contest by upholding the 
negative side of the subject, "Re­
solved: that the United States
.should agree to cancellation of the 
inter-allled war debts.” The Beta 
Theta PI fraternity argued on the 
affirmative side.
Because of the large amount of 
Interest displayed by students dur­
ing the contest and the opinion of 
the judges that the debating was 
on a very high level, the decision 
has been made to form an organi­
zation called the Carnegie Debat­
ing' Union. 'Phe purpose of this or­
ganization will bo to foster Intra­
mural debating In the future and 
to sponsor un Inter-collegiate de­
bating team for Carnegie. Al­
though It Is quite late In tho sea­
son, there is a possibility that a 
varsity Intor-colloglato debuting 
team t.o represent Carnegie will bo 
organized this spring.
An organization meeting of the 
Debating Union will be held tomor­
row at -1:30 o’clock in Robin 131-A, 
Industries Building. All those who 
have participated In intra-mural 
debating this season and those 
who are interested in the forma» 
tion of tills organization are 
cordially invited t.o be present. In 
the opinion of all those concerned 
with the debating contest, the con­
test was highly successful and 
they therefore hope that the Debat­
ing Union will get off to a good 
start this spring.
In the finals of the contest, Paul 
Phenegar and William Bostick 
were the successful debaters for 
Delta Tau Delta, and John Lowes 
and Charles Shavet represented 
Beta Theta Pi. The chairman of 
the meeting was Professor L. T. 
Lawler, under whose guidance the 
interfraternity debating competi­
tion was started. The judges were 
Mr. J. D. Beatty, head of the 
Bureau of Recommendations, Mr. 
R. E. Parsliall, and Mr. A. Wright, 
instructors in the Department of, 
English.

Carnegie Receives 
Model of Plant
The Metallurgy Department re­
ceived a model of the huge power 
project on the Saguenay River in 
Canada. The loan, which was 
made to Carnegie by the Alcoa 
Company, a subsidiary of the Alu­
minum Company of America, is for 
an indefinite period and was 
brought about for the purpose of 
enabling students in the Metallurgy 
Department to study the design, 
construction, and qualities of the 
project.
The development, which is only 
partly completed, will constitute 
one of the largest power plants in 
the world and will be used by the 
Aluminum Company in the manu­
facture of their products. It is 
estimated that, when completed, 
the deArelopment will have a capac­
ity of 1,000,000 H. P.
The model which is on display 
in the Materials Laboratory, was 
loaned to Carnegie as a token of 
appreciation for the research work 
carried on at Carnegie for the suc­
cess of the project.

The seventh of the current 
series of lectures, sponsored by 
the United Typotlietae of America 
for the benefit of the Carnegie De­
partment of Printing and all others 
interested in the printing industry, 
will be deliverd by William D. 
Hall of Washington. D. C. at 3:30, 
Monday. The lecture meeting will 
be held in Room 251, College of 
Industries, and will be open to the 
public.
Mr. Hall ’21, who graduated from 
the Department, of Printing, is af­
filiated with the United Typotlietae 
of America as Director of Produc­
tion Management. His address 
will deal with recent developments 
in printing processes.
Dr. Max Schoen, Head of the De­
partment of Psychology, was born 
in that part of .Austria which lias 
since become Czecho-Slovakia and 
came to this country at the age of 
thirteen. He attended public 
schools in New York City and re­
ceived his A. B. degree from The 
College of the City of New York 
in 1911. After 
teaching in

sociate in the Psychology of 
Music; here his investigations into 
the nature of the vibratoc in ar­
tistic singing led to his Ph.D. de­
gree in 1920. In the spring of that 
year he came to Carnegie as As­
sistant Professor in Musical Re­
search in what was then called the
Division of Co-operative Research, 
and in 1924 took his present posi­
tion.
During his stay here Dr. Schoen 
has written six books and has been 
a frequent contributor to psycho­
logical, musical, and educational 
journals'. His - most 'important 
books are “Human Nature,” “Art 
and Beauty,” “The Effects of Mu­
sic,” and “The Beautiful in Music,” 
the first two of which are used as 
textbooks here and at other insti­
tutions of learning. He is now en­
gaged in writing another book 
which will deal with a survey of 
man and his affairs.
Dr. Schoen during the past few 
years has been -giving lectures on 
an average of twice a week. The 
subjects of these lectures are nu­
merous, but the underlying theme 
is usually human interest, hered­
ity, or religion. His doctor’s 
thesis, which was the first scien­
tific investigation on the nature of 
artistic singing, has since led to a 
great number of investigations in 
the same field. The vast amount 
of work he "has done is doubtlessly 
the reason his name will appear 
in the next issue of “Who’s Who 
in America.”
Dr. Schoen’s principal hobbies 
are walking and fishing; his fa­
vorite vacation spots are in Can­
ada.

Cut 10 Units 
From Courses 
Of Freshmen
Students Taking History 
And Shops Benefit 
By Reduction
Effective September 1, 1933, the 
’reshmen curriculum in the Col­
leges of Engineering and lndus- 
.ries will De reduced by ten hours. 
This, reduction which is the result 
jf action taken by the Educational 
Senate of Carnegie was approved 
jy President Baker.
The reauirements in Industrial 
History have been changed from 
three hours of recitation and six 
.lours of preparation, a total of 
aine units, to two weekly recita­
tions each requiring two hours of 
preparation and totaling six units.
The freshman shop requirements 
with the exception of the Depart­
ment of Printing have been reduc- 
ad from three two-hour shops each 
week to two two-hour shops. The 
scheduling of these shops will be 
arranged in three groupings.
Group A will include those elect- 
ng Commercial, Electrical, 'Me­
chanical (except Heating and Ven- 
-ilating option), or Metallurgical 
Engineering and Physics will 
jchedule: Machine Shop 1-720,
foundry Shop 1-760, Pattern Shop 
.-780, and Forge-Welding Shop 
1-780
Group B, includes those electing 
3hemical, Civil, or Mining Engi­
neering, the Heating and Ventilat- 
ng option of Mechanical Engineer- 
ng, Chemistry, Mathematics, and 
industrial Education. The fresh­
men taking these courses will 
schedule: Masonry Shop 1-120,
Sheet Metal Shop 1-200, Carpentry 
•»hop UlO, and Welding Shop 
[-502.
Group C, is composed of the 
Printers and the shop schedule 
will not be afPected by _ the new 
iroupings.
The usual rule allowing--fresh­
men who are taking R. O. T. C. 
to omit classes in Physical Educa- 
.ion will remain in effect.
Irregular freshmen now in class 
who have omitted Industrial I-Iis- 
ory to make room for some other 
subject will later schedule this sub­
ject for six units and will not be 
required to make up the difference 
between the present and the new 
requirements.
The Educational Senate has also 
ruled that those who change their 
elections at the close of the fresh­
man year will not be required to 
schedule shops other than those 
completed in their freshman pro­
gram.
CONTRIB
Editor, The Carnegie Tartan:
“If I had my way, I would not 
give exemptions in anything!” 
Such was the declaration of Dr. 
Webster N. Jones, Director of the 
College of Engineering, comment­
ing recently on the practice of giv­
ing exemptions from final examina­
tions. The departments in the Col­
lege of Engineering seem to favor 
the abolishment of exemptions in 
their courses, making final exam­
inations compulsory for all stu­
dents. And it is only right ana 
just for thè departments to take 
.his step in the progress of educa­
tional methods.
Upon the Curriculum Committee 
6f the College of Engineering rests 
the problem whether or not the de­
partments should undercake such a 
step. Now is the appropriate time 
for consideration of the problem so 
action can be taken at the close of 
this -semester. If there exists any 
ideal standard for an educational 
program, then certainly this will 
constitute a proper advancement.
The faults arising from the giv­
ing of exemptions loom out glar 
ingly. To give a few the privilege 
of remaining from examinations— 
leaving a feeling of bitterness 
among those students who failea 
to make the required grade, is 
especially to be avoided. Granted 
that exemptions incite the student 
to study harder during the semes­
ter for the privilege, still, it is not 
enough ground for the awarding 
of it.
Linked with the idea of exemp­
tions, the reaction of the instruc­
tor toward the student, whether 
favorable or not, plays an import­
ant role in the final decision. After 
all, instructors and professors are 
human beings like us all, and it is 
perfectly possible to assume that 
a degree of personal like or dislike 1
.Three seniors in the Department 
of Architecture at Carnegie have 
placed as finalists in the competi­
tion for the Stewardsou Traveling 
scholarship as a result of the pre­
liminary exercise recently held. 
They are William G. Perry, Ed­
ward K. Scliade, and Henry Jandl. 
The Stewardson Scholarship, which 
covers expenses for one year’s 
study abroad and is valued at 
twelve hundred dollars, is award­
ed annually, through competition, 
to a student of architecture in the 
state of Pennsylvania. Thg_title 
of. the preliminary exercise was 
“A Memorial to Johannes Sebas­
tian Bach.
In the finals the student is al­
lowed complete freedom to the ex­
tent of writing his own program, 
providing that the problem he 
chooses to solve in some way fur­
thers the advancement of some 
phase of architectural planning 
and composition. Students com­
peting will have all expenses paid 
to be present at the final judgment 
of their problems, which is held at 
the University of Pennsylvania. 
There they will be given the op­
portunity to point out to the jury 
the merits of their particular prob­
lem.
The Stewardson competition 
stresses not only design and plan 
but also insight into the profes­
sion which is tested in the final 
judgment by chpice of subject, and 
salesmanship.

Eilers ’35, I-Iinda Grossman ’35. 
Activities keys will be awarded at 
the party.__________ _______
will greatly influence them as to 
¿lie final decision.
A professor in the Massachusetts 
Institute of Technology once wrote 
that the preparation that students 
in the department of Electrical 
Engineering had to undergo for one 
of the final examinations in an 
Electrical Engineering course was 
worth more to them than some of 
the courses themselves. The men­
tal struggle helped the student to 
prepare for the real problems with 
which he will be confronted in 
actual life. This applies to all en­
gineering students, as well as the 
electricals.
It is a well-known fact that one 
must know how to study for a final 
examination. One who goes aim­
lessly through the process will find 
himself repeating the course, for 
the simple reason that he could 
not assimilate the whole semester’s 
work in a comprehensible manner. 
Is not this process of studying for 
the final just as important as the 
course itself?
Of all the reasons given by en­
gineering students advocating ex­
emptions, one perhaps raises an 
:mportant question. Why should a 
student with satisfactory work dur­
ing the semester be compelled to 
take the final examination? By 
these words these same students 
condemn our present system of 
mass education. If the students 
have a firm grasp of the material, 
no reasons whatever should occa­
sion fear for the examination. 
Education today stresses not the 
actual grasping of the subject mat­
ter, but the final grades as the in­
dication of the student's knowledge 
of the subject. We are made to 
feel that the essential feature of a 
college education consists of a con­
tinuous seeking for grades.
A contrast as to what is ideal 
and what is not in education is 
noticed in the opposing attitudes 
assumed by the night school stu­
dents and the day students in re­
gard to their-studies. Interested in 
obtaining a full understanding of 
the course, the night student re­
ceives his grades as a satisfaction 
for work well performed. The ob­
jective aim of many day students is 
the grade. This attitude robs him 
of the greatest advantage he may 
ever hope to attain from a college 
course. Abolishment of exemp­
tions in all the departments in the 
College of Engineering will go far 
in removing this- false assumption.

WHILE AT CARNEGIE
Bieame Cadet Flier at Kelly 
1 ield, Texas, One Month 
Ago After Transfer
Herman Stearns Davis, aged 24, 
graduate of Carnegie in the class 
of 1931, was fatal'.y injured last 
Wednesday when his plane crash­
ed near Helotes, Texas, about 
twenty miles northeast of San An­
tonio. 1-Ie was removed to the 
base hospital at Fort Sam Hous­
ton where he died. Further details, 
involving the nature of the crash 
are lacking'. Davis was buried 
Sunday morning at his mother’s 
home in Dover, Delaware.
Mr. Davis, the son of Dr. and 
Mrs. Herman Davis of 4323 And- 
; over Terrace, East End, ranked in 
! the first section of his class at 
Carnegie. He was a student in 
the Department of Mechanical En­
gineering, Aeronautical option, and 
was a member of the Aero Club, 
the American Society of Mechan­
ical Engineers, and the R. O. T. G. 
He was always attracted by aero­
nautics, often making trips to Rodg­
ers Field to watch the planes in 
action.
Last June he went to Randolph 
Field, joined the army, and receiv­
ed an appointment- at Randolph 
from Pittsburgh. He completed 
his eight months’ course at Ran­
dolph with a general average o! 
95. About a month ago he was 
transferred to Kelly Field, Texas 
where as a cadet flier he chose 
bombing planes as the type which 
he wished to pilot.
The body was sent on from San 
Antonio last Thursday morning. II 
rested in the Pittsburgh station 
for two hours and continued on its 
journey to Dover. The govern­
ment sent as an escort Cadet 
Thomas Scafield of Pittsburgh, a 
close v friend and fellow cadet ol 
Davis at Kelly Field.
Davis was a member or the 
Bellefleld Presbyterian Church ol 
Pittsburgh. Mr. Davis, Sr., former 
cashier at Carnegie, has a doctor­
ate from Columbia University; he 
completed his under-graduate work 
at Princeton and is a recognized 
authority on astronomy. Davis' 
mother is an outstanding geneolo- 
gist.
A memorial service for Mr. 
Davis will be held on Sunday, May 
14 at 7:00 p. m. in the Sunday 
School Chapel of the Bellefleld 
Presbyterian Church. All friends 
of'iMr. Davis are invited.
Educators Offer 
Summer Courses 
In Soviet Russia
A unique venture in summer 
study abroad is announced by 
three American educational socio. 
logists—Professor Daniel I-I. Kulp 
II., of Teachers College, Columbia 
University; Harvey W. Zorbaugli 
and Irving V. Sollins, School of 
Education, New York University. 
Under their joint direction the 
newly organized American Sum­
mer School in Russia will offer two 
courses abroad in conjunction with 
a tour to the Union of Soviet Re­
publics.
Both courses are to take 60 
hours each, and will be given with 
the cooperation of the faculties of 
the universities of Moscow and 
Leningrad, and the Soviet Educa­
tional authorities. They are open 
to American teachers, social work­
ers, and students of social science 
and education. The courses are 
described as follows: “Experi­
mental Educational Programs in 
the Soviet Union” and “Contem­
porary Trends—Political, " Techn- 
logical, and Cultural—in the Sov­
iet Union.” In addition, there will 
be lectures and talks by eminent 
Russians, such as Dinkhevitch and 
Pavlov; and the well-known New 
York Times Russian correspon­
dent, Walter Duranty.
The directors stress the fact that 
this is not to be an ordinary sight­
seeing tour, but an organized, sys­
tematic study at first-hand of the 
Russian experiment. It is planned, 
too, to make these courses the 
basis of a permanent international 
student exchange between the two 
countries.
The group will leave New'York 
on July 1 and return on Septem­
ber 4, stopping at London, Lenin 
grad and Moscow, with side trips to 
Paris and Berlin. Regular stu­
dents are offered the opportunity 
of earning academic credit. School 
teachers may complete “alertness” 
requirements by taking these 
courses.
Enrollment is now in progress. 
Applications, for registration 
should be made to Irving Y. Sol­
lins, Sqhool of Education, 75 South

Seniors in the Department of 
Chemical Engineering, under the 
direction of Mr. A. II. Weil/., have 
visited approximately 25* manufac­
turing establishments of the Pitts­
burgh district during this semester.
The purpose of the trips is to 
allow the students to study not 
only particular types.of apparatus, 
but a so plant layout and routing 
of materials, shipping facilities, 
and the general problems of plant 
operation. After each trip the stu­
dents are. required to make re­
ports on the plant visited.
Owing to business conditions Mr. 
Weil/, had considerable difficulty in 
arranging the trips «this year, but 
he found that most firms were anx­
ious to co-operate in showing the 
students their plants. In many 
oases the students were taken on 
tours through plants which had 
been shut down for months..
The following is a list of the 
plants which the students have vis­
ited: Armstrong Cork Company,
Beaver. Falls plant; Patterson 
Foundry and Machine Company,

College men and women, 
accustomed to regulating 
their own expenditures and 
planning their own budgets 
are receiving valuable train­
ing in handling money that 
will prove beneficial in after­
life. In this connection, a 
bank account is an import­
ant asset to people of col­
lege age. The Mellon Na­

KE I£f KC£Ru£R
FOUR YEARS AGO I came to this Institution of higher learning 
for the purpose of gaining a collegc education and Incidentally to lead 
a 111 o somewhat as essayed by "Collcgo Humor” and displayed by 
motion pictures; although I had been duly warned otherwise by an 
elder brother who had preceded me here. It took but several months 
to get those previous notions of college life out of my mind and real­
ly llnd out what a technical institution is like. I found that we were 
expected to follow instructions; never to ask the question “why." We 
were expected to learn and not to live. “Nose to the grindstone" was 
the prevailing idea; and I followed the crowd.* * * * *
HOWEVER MY WEAKNESS for sports which led me to participate 
and to write about them in high school, also led me Into the same 
paths here at Carnegie. I attempted to participate in one or two odd 
forms of athletics, but the coaches didn’t seem to appreciate my abil­
ity. Then too, 1 found out that unlike high school, some of the spoils 
were not run entirely for sport's sake—not entirely for the purpose 
of the giving the students a chance for an outlet for their energies. 
All of which showed me wiiy, on several of the teams 1 had looked 
into, there seemed to be players' there who had much more experience 
and ability than I. But I knew that such matters were not my business 
and were not talked about in public, but I was equally determined that 
they should become my business at some future time. So, having 
failed au a player I decidod that 1 would transfer my' position from 
the inside looking out to the outside looking in, and devote my time 
to telling someone else how the game should be played.# * * * +
FOR THREE YEARS I STRIVED and looked forward to becoming 
sports editor of this paper. I made plans of what I would do when,
or if, I received the position. But for some reason or other, after
gaining what I had set out to do, half of the fun was gone. It seems 
that way in most everything. We strive to attain something and after 
attaining it find that most of the pleasure was In the anticipation.
* * * * ¦*
REGARDLESS OF THE LETDOWN I have mentioned, this year was 
started with the idea in mind that something was to be done, or should 
bo done, about Carnegie athletics, and that that something should come 
about through the sports page, But the I bought came, "was it worth
while to cause the big disturbance in this school over athletics?”
There was the discussion about the change of coaches. 1 could never 
get whole heartedly into the subject because It is my opinion that 
there is Loo much stress put upon the "winning" of games; If is that 
which lias led the evil (?) of subsidatlon and professionalism. Who 
cares len years from now whether or not a certuin game was won or 
lost?
If one wore able to got all of the facls and had plenty of time to 
publicize them; an oxposure might be worth while—If there was much 
to expose. And oven if it wore done, would all that fuss be worth 
while for what would be accomplished? I really Lhoughl there was 
not an awful lot to gain. Consequently my relations with the ath­
letic departments liavo boon very enjoyable. I can still walk Into the
field house without getting thrown out; although I have had to run 
pretty 1'asL several Limes or I would have been Lossed out, and not 
gently.* + * , * *
I HAVE BEEN CRITCIZED for being too conservative by the persons 
more radical about the campus. This criticism is true. But the fact 
still remains that, veen In this day and age, free speech and free 
prosa are denied. It Is difficult to rationalize one's action of throw­
ing away five thousand dollars, the cost of a sheepskin, for the pleas­
ure of following one’s desire of being spectacular.
I have been taken over the coals and threatened with bodily in­
jury for giving Borne people publicity, and have been promised the 
same treatment by others for failure to give them their due praise. I 
have been called down for giving m^ opinions, and have been called 
down for not giving them. But after all Is said and done, it has been 
Interesting, educational, and lots of fun getting out this sports page. *****
MY ONLY REGRET IS that 1 wish tlmt the few hours available on 
Sunday afternoons for golfing out tills column, trying to make the lay­
out of I ho pago fairly presentable, and getting the copy to the printer 
before the deadline, could Imve boon a little longer, if one were able 
to metlllafo a few days before attempting to oxpross»hlm8o)f, the re- 
Miilfti no doubt, should be better, But such time wan not available, 
and here I am offering alibis.
And before bidding you all goodbye, I would like lo nay LhaI If 
any of you readers happen lo get down town after graduation, lake a 
little time off and walk by the bread line. There you will llnd your 
scribe and, no doubt, many of his classmates. A few kind words 
would he gratefully received.

“In former years about seventy

the Tartan, trackers meet Geneva 
College in a meet which promises 
to provide all the thrills necessary 
to a successful Campus Week open­
ing function. In the last few years 
the Covenantors, who annually 
turn out leading cinder teams In 
this district, have been a special 
nemisis to Carnegie and nothing 
would give the Skibo squad more 
confidence for the Pitt and Temple 
engagements than a victory over 
Geneva.
Geneva Favored 
On paper however, the Gold and 
White looks to be the stronger and 
destined to cart off another victory 
unless Captain Coulter and his 
mates spring a few surprises. A 
team composed of such nationally 
prominent athletes as Spencer and 
Beggs, the former a (1-5 high jumper 
and the latter a javelin tosser who 
lias seen 200 feet written beside 
his name, is certainly going to be 
difficult to reckon with.
The Coventers’ supporting cast 
includes such performers as 
Cliff Aultman, Geneva’s all-around 
•;reat, and Evans, Sauer and Dunn, 
a trio of sprinter-hurdlers who 
rank with any in this section. 
Evans, incidently, touched out 
Coulter In the high hurdles last 
vear to Kive the big Canuck his 
only set-back in intercollegiate dual 
competition.
Boast Good Weight Men 
in addition Lo Beggs and Ault­
man in the javelin, Geneva boasts 
a really outstanding weight man 
who handles the other throe 
events. Rupp, the gentleman un­
der discussion heaved the shot, 
hammer and discus last year 
against Carnegio well enough to 
win all three firsts and will be just 
as hard to set down this season.
'Phe Sklb/is, with Burke, Allan 
and Schell are eocpectod Lo pile up 
nolnts In the distance runs as 
Noulton and Wray, Geneva’s two 
best hoofers have graduaLed. The 
pole vault, with Aultman as the 
opposition looks like another 
Geneva victory but Carnegie should 
'•ogaln riome of those polnt.H in the 
broad Jump.
Dashes to Feature 
The feature running events of 
the afternoon will undoubtedly be 
the dashen and hurdles, and Cap- 
•aIn Coulter looks to be In for a 
large assignment In any of tho 
events which he may enter.

At the conclusion of spring prac­
tice last Saturday, Coach Howard 
Harpster may have been convinced 
that he still had plenty to worry 
about but LhaL Lhe tackles would 
probably take care of themselves 
against the best of them.
The new Carnegie mentor ha» 
no less than four first class men 
for these positions, all of whom are 
plenty big and plenty fast. On the 
roster are such mastodons as Croft, 
Forsman, Doloway, and Nutter, 
who will cause loads of grief to 
every team on next year’s "sui­
cide” schedule.
“Dutch" Croft was one of the 
three reasons why the left side of 
the line was almost impregnable 
lasl season, Lhe oilier Lwo being 
Captain "Hooks” Sample and Cap­
tain-elect Red Stewart. Dutch 
came here in the fall of 1930 from 
Bentleyville, but he was not In 
school last year and so has two 
more seasons of varsity football 
yet to play. Mr. Croft tips me 
beam at about 210 and stands 
some six feet and three inches.
Carl "Fuzzy” Forsman will prob­
ably capture the other regular 
tackle assignment, for he has held 
down Lhe right tackle hole for the 
pasL Lwo seasons wilh very little 
trouble. 1-Ie hails from Midland, 
Pa., and is another boy built on 
large proportions. ,
Cliff Doloway bails from Port 
Allegheny, and while he got into 
only a few games last year, he has 
convinced the Skibo mentors that 
he has plenty of stuff. Without a 
doubt he will participate in plenty 
of games this fall. He has two 
more years to go.
Lee Nutter will be the third 
junior tackle In Lhe fold. 1-Ie is big 
and fasl, weighing well over 200 
pounds, and he has quite a reputa­
tion as a boxer. He played fine 
ball last season in the capaclly of 
substitute tackle, and great things 
are expected of him.
Faculty Athletes 
To Show Their 
Stuff on Friday
Saturday morning will find the 
corner drug store doing a good 
business in horse liniment, for it 
will bo Hull, hect.lc "day after’’ for 
soveral bottor known membors of 
our faculty. They are planning pn 
giving tho senior class a severe 
workout In two of tho very strenu­
ous pastimes, namely tennis and 
mushball.
Captain Lawler of the faculty 
mushballers claims ho has a really 
strong outfit, including .such stars 
of former days as Doc Neeley, who 
used to frolic in the big time, 
ltollin Davis, a former bush leaguer 
of some repute, and many others 
who think their right arms are still 
limber enough to trim a few over­
rated undergraduates.
The mushball game is slated for 
three o’clock while the tennis meet 
is scheduled for an hour earlier.
J. was rained out. The contest 
was to have been held in Washing­
ton but when the time came for 
the bus to leave Lhe weather looked 
more like Easter Sunday than any­
thing conductive to good track per­
formances so the melee was post­
poned. At present it has not been 
determined when or if the conlest 
will be run off but to date indica­
tions point to a later day with the 
possibility of the Presidents visit 
ing Carnegie instead of being hosts 
as was originally planned.

The combined Art School Team 
carried off the honors at Lhe an­
nual swimming meet last Thursday 
noon in the Gym pool. A total of. 
28 points was the highest score 
and the next was a 26 made by the 
combined Junior and Senior team 
of Margaret Morrison. Tho Soph­
omores followed witli 23 points and 
the Freshmen scored 20. It was 
the peppiest meet that W. A. A. 
lias sponsored for a long time and 
more than twenty-five girls took 
part in it. The free-style relay was 
the major event of the contest and 
was won by the Freshman class. 
A number of girls will receive 
poinls for swimming when Lhe 
final results of the lengths are 
taken this week. Anyone 
hasn’t had an opportunity lo make 
one of these endurance swims may 
do so on one of the swimming days 
this week. Report your number of 
lengths swum in one period to 
Miss Russell or Miss Kanricli. The 
class which has the highest total 
will receive ten points to be award­
ed to each member of that team. 
Five and three points will be given 
to the next two classes. W. A. A. 
takes this opportunity to thank 
Mitzie Gray for the splendid swim­
ming season which she managed
HOW TO AVOID BONERS
POOR BILL BONER-he just 
can’t think straight. He thinks 
a person is safe from contagious 
discaso if he is intoxicated!
But no collogo man ever pulls 
boners with a good pipo between his 
tooth. There’s something about a 
pipo and tobacco that soothes a man, 
helps him think straight. Tluit is, of 
course, if ho uses tho right tobacco. 
A rcccnt investigation showed Edge- 
worth to bo the favorite tobacco at 
1,2 out of 5J, leading colleges.
If you’re not already an Edgeworth 
smoker, there’3 new smoking satis­
faction waiting for you. Edgeworth’s 
blend of fine old burleys is distinc­
tive, different. You’ll fcnoiv — after 
the first puff.
You can buy Edgeworth tobacco 
anywhere in two forms—Edgeworth 
Ready-Rubbed and Edgeworth Plug 
Slice. All sizes—15{i pocket package 
to pound humidor tin. Or, if you 
would like to try before you buy,

that the organization has spon­

congratulales them on their suc­

The deluge that the campus ex­
perienced during the last week 
struck the tennis team and carried 
three games -from the schedule. 
On Tuesday, the netmen found the 
weather too moist and the journey 
to W. & J. was cancelled. Thurs­
day developed into a wonderful 
tennis day but the courts were 
still under water so the match with 
Duquesne was also carried from 
the books. On Saturday the 
racquet carriers got half way to 
Penn State before storm reports 
from that campus forced them to 
turn back, and so ended a beauti­
ful tennis week.
Nothing deterred Rufus Hartdig 
gave us notice that he intended to 
invade Pitt, yesterday for a sched­
uled match. The match with the 
Presidents which was rained out 
last week will be played Thursday 
at Washington, Pa., if the weather 
man allows. Although no engage­
ment for the netmen is scheduled 
for Saturday, there is a strong pos­
sibility that one of the postponed 
matches will be put In there. The 
Pitt players will probably gain 
their usual victory over the Plaid 
netmen for which the Skibos 
should retaliate TTy winning on 
Thursday.

Carnegie sports fans will be 
pleased to find that a sport has 
been found in which their repre­
sentatives can win and then some. 
West Virginia was touted to have 
just about the best greensmen In 
the district, but the engineers 
from Pittsburgh were plenty hot 
Saturday and the Mountaineers 
were rudely jolted In their own 
backyard, 5-4.
The Morgantown aggregation 
will repay the visit this Saturday 
when they will again match putts 
with the Plaid.
Haverstick, Tartan ace, lost to 
Hoblitzel, West Virginia captain, 
but McKenzie, Kay, and Reese all 
came through with wins. Red 
Fergus and Burgoyne lost their in­
dividual matches, but the Skibos 
copped two out of the three two­
some matches, the teams of Kay- 
Reese and McKenzie-Burgoyne 
coming through handily. Tho 
team of Haverstick and Fergus 
lost a close match.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN, TUESDAY, MAY 0. 19335
»fight
Yes, the secret is out and the 
¦winner is announced. This night 
marathon is certainly a big league 
affair. Would be interesting to 
watch. the “greekers” strutting 
their stuff to come in under the 
tape and win the much prized title 
of champion night school traveler. 
Well Frank Cechvala, Jr., of Ford 
City is the happy and proud pos­
sessor of the title. Eighty miles 
per night is certainly nothing to 
be coughed at and I am not sur­
prised in the least that be won the 
derby. Running him a close second 
I see was Lester Mohrbacher who 
hails from New Brighton, Pa. I 
didn’t think Greensburg would go 
unrewarded as this section of the 
State always sends a big delega­
tion to Carnegie, and so M. J. 
Kellener is to be congratulated for 
bringing New Stanton, Pa., into 
prominence.
Well, another race has just been 
concluded too. It was the race be­
tween the profs, and those on the 
other side of the platform—stu­
dents. Last week certainly was a 
big event for a great many of the 
night students. Eventful in many 
ways. Some of us found out that 
we knew twice as much as we 
thought we did, and others of us 
now realize that we know just half 
as much as we presumed we did. 
Of course. I am out of the picture, 
since I don’t take any exams. All 
my work comes under what is 
known as judgments—there, I 
nearly revealed my identity, but 
everyone is not familiar with what 
these are so I am fairly safe at 
that. I heard several sighs of re­
lief expressed while crossing the 
"cut,” also some comparing of 
notes and expostulations, all of 
which indicate that there are some 
serious-minded night students, even 
if I am not.
To some the closing of the reg­
ular term means a big load off their 
shoulders, and to others, it may 
mean a period of more leisure time. 
How to spend this time, no doubt, 
will he a question, a solution of 
which I am not going to hazzard. 
But I do know that it will be funny 
for some not to have to rush* be­
tween the hours of 6:30 and 7:30 
to be on time for classes. They 
are going to find it hard to get out 
of the habit of rushing.
Two crowning events have taken 
place on the night campus this 
year. The first was that eventful 
af* when the night arts discov­
ered they had a queen in their 
mldat. It must have been a big 
surprise for those artists of the 
various departments to see such a 
stately affair as was held a couple 
of weeks ago when this new found 
queen was crowned. The second 
crowning event was the finding of 
the traveling night student. Maybe 
his installation may not be, 
pompous as the queen's, but who 
can tell there may be something 
awaiting him. Now that we know 
who the two crown wearers are, I 
wonder who the’ next one is to be 
crowned. Better start a race by 
myself as I would be sure to be 
crowned.
Closing this week we are told 
that the Night Student Council will 
hold the Inter-Niglit College dance. 
If this dance will be as good as the 
other dances held by the Council, 
and there is no reason to suspect 
that it will not, we will have had 
four big times when all of our night 
students were given a chance to 
shuffle their feet to the tunes of as 
many orchestras. You know, these 
dances are big items in the lives of 
the night students, and I am sure 
that if they were to be curtailed or 
stopped, they would be missed 
greatly. I am looking forward to a 
big time this Saturday evening and 
hope to see all my friends for the 
last time, of course they don’t 
know me individually; but that 
doesn’t matter. I have the drop on 
them, and it is good once in a while 
to be able to sit back and—well 
you know how it feels.
Nine Week Supplementary 
Term Under Way This Week
Students Interested in Taking Any Extra Courses 
Are Asked To Report At Registar’s Office 
Any Day During Week For Information
The Supplementary term of 1033 begins immediately after the 
close of the second term of the night school year. The majority of 
subjects are for nine weeks’ instruction, beginning Monday, May 8. 
and ending Friday, July S.
The purpose of the supplementary term is three-fold: it enables 
students to make up the work of a term or of a year in one subject 
and thus corrects an irregular schedule; it enables students to lighten 
their schedule during the regular night school year, and for those 
students in the Colleges of Engineering and Industries who are work­
ing for the bachelor’s degree, it enables them to take courss offered 
only at this time.
Below is a list of the subjects offered in the 1933 term, together 
with the tuition fee. Unless otherwise indicated each subject begins 
May S and ends July 7. Subjects for which there are less than

Workers Report in 
Gym Sat., 2:30 P. M.
All students interested in 
earning points toward an insig­
nia award are requested to re­
port in the men’s gymnasium 
this Saturday afternoon by 2:30 
o’clock. A great deal of work 
has to be done to make the 
necessary preparations for the 
Inter-Night College dance to be 
held that evening and all stu­
dents are earnestly requested

Interest Shown 
In Parthenon 
Model Exhibit
After a year of work, Lawrence 
W. Hitt, Architect, assisted by 
Ross Polis, a model of the Par- 
thenin, an early Greek architectur­
al wonder, has been placed on dis­
play at the Carnegie Institute. 
This model is believed to be the 
third reproduction made in this 
country. It is not necessary to 
dwell on the technical aspects of 
its architecture. Perhaps most of 
us would be bored or at least not 
interested, but for sheer beauty it 
is something worth seeing.
Its very simplicity is one of its 
outstanding merits. It is seeming­
ly nothing but walls and roof sup­
ported by innumerable pillars. All 
around the top 011 the outside is a 
frieze of sculptured figures, some 
eight hundred, all representative 
of some phase of Greek life or re­
ligion. Within stands a huge god­
dess.
As already mentioned, the tech­
nical aspects of its architecture 
may be over the beads of most of 
us, but there is a sense of beauty 
and the interest it invokes as 
something that has come to us out 
of the past, will not fail to excite 
admiration. It is well worth any­
one’s time to stop for a few min­
utes in the Hall of Architecture at 
the Carnegie Institute lor a view 
of this masterpiece.
One of the duties of the first 
professor at ROCHESTER UNI­
VERSITY was to chase cows off 
the campus.
Ticket Returns Due 
After Dance Sat.
Students are requested to 
make all ticket returns imme­
diately after the dance this 
Saturday night. The committee 
on awards will begin its work 
of awarding insignia for the 
year and unless all returns are 
in students may lose some very 
necessary points toward an 
award. This applies also to 
tickets on previous dances still 
out. Returns should be mailed 
to John F. Simpson, Treasurer, 
Night Student Council, C. I. T. 
Post Office. Schenley Park, 
Pittsburgh. Pa.
Ending of Term 
Finds Students 
Unconcerned
Last week brought the regular 
term of the night school ofiicially 
to a close. This past week of 
trial and tribulations was just 
about the last straw. After exam­
inations everyone feels that, a few 
months of something else would be 
more than welcome.
Some of us will come back next 
year while others will, perhaps, be 
prevented from returning. There 
are some who did not make the 
best grades, but this needn’t be a 
discouraging factor, considering 
the hardships under which most of 
us have had to work. The present 
day conditions have a tendency to 
make one less inclined to work at 
top speed.
Scattered throughout the school 
year has been a number of social 
activities which have afforded us 
an opportunity of meeting other 
students and forming friendships 
which are sure to last.
Attending night school becomes 
a habit after the first year or two, 
so now that the regular term is 
over plans are being made to ar­
range a schedule for our next 
year’s work.
When the male students at the 
UNIVERSITY OF NEBRASKA 
elected a “Perfect College Girl” to 
preside at their Junior-Senior 
Prom, one of the qualifications the 
winner had to possess was 
"M-mmm.” The editor of the 
Awgwan defined "M-mmm” as "gen­
eral seductiveness”—a Nebraskan 
synonym for Elinor Glyn’s outmod­
ed "It.” The Nebraska co-eds in 
selecting their "Perfect College 
Man” included the quality "O-ooo" 
(male equivalent of “M-mmm.”)
Inter-Night College Dance 
Marks End Of Social Session
EI Gitzen and His Orchestra to Furnish Music For 
Last Affair On Night School Calendar For 
Which Big Turnout is Expected
This Saturday night will mark 
the end of another social season of 
the Night Student Council. A 
dance in the men's gymnasium 
will give students their last oppor­
tunity to meet each other at a 
school social event, before each 
goes his own way for the summer 
vacation.
The Inter-NIgnt College Dance, 
its official name, is one of the old­
est traditions on the night campus 
and indications already point to a 
turnout that will far exceed at­
tendance at any function held this 
season. If present plans material­
ize, the social chairman hints that 
the evening will offer something 
new in the way . of entertainment 
to the dancers.
A new and different orchestra 
has been secured for this dance. 
El Gitzen and his orchestra has 
been retained to supply the music 
for the occasion. This group of 
musicians is new to the campus, 
having never appeared before any 
Carnegie group, but comes with an 
enviable reputation of having 
achieved great success at many 
other notable functions. El Gitzen 
and his boys promise music that 
will long be remembered and 110 
doubt call for other appearances 
next year.
Invitations have been extended 
to Mr; and Mrs. Robert B. Leighou, 
Mr. and Mrs. W. H. Michener, Mr. 
and Mi's. C. W. Prine, Mr. and Mrs. 
L. H. Miller, Mr. and Mrs. W. II. 
Dosey. Mr. and Mrs. L. Bradley, 
Mr. and Mrs. W. Pfouts, Mr. and 
Mrs. A. II. Blaisdell. Mr. and Mrs. 
J. B. lillis, Mr. and Mrs. R. Sim hoi I, 
and Mr. and Mrs. G. P. I-Ialliwell.
Tickets have been mailed to all 
night school salesmen and are now 
available. The assessment is 0110 
dollar per couple.
The waiters In the mass hall at 
VIRGINIA POLYTECHNIQUE IN­
STITUTE spent a pleasant evening 
dancing at their second annual hop 
sponsored by "Pop” Owens,

DIDJA NOTICE
THAT it’s all over.
THAT the profs heaved a 
sigh of relief, reserving the big 
one until the last papers are 
graded.
THAT a good many die-hards 
are coming to summer school, 
but yours truly is going so far 
away that even the radio waves 
won’t find me.
THAT most of us have that 
lost feeling now that we don’t 
have classes to attend and les­
sons to prepare.
THAT this new feeling is al­
ready wearing off in the joy of 
our new freedom.
THAT some seemed to be 
glad of the end, but others 
claimed they were sorry, the 
phonies!
THAT the night distance 
traveling champion is through 
strutting his stuff, not sorry are 
you, pal?
THAT the weather man was 
sorry to see the end last Friday 
and shed many tears, oh yeah!
THAT Pop Manson has al­
ready assumed that appearance 
of having lost his best friend, 
or is it his way of showing 
great relief.
THAT the campus steeds are 
going to live a lonely life for a 
while, hope somebody leads 
them astray before next fall.
THAT you won’t have much 
longer to read our ranting and

Last Night Art 
School Dance Is 
Colorful Affair
C. S. EDMÄN
PRINTER 
6470 Monitor Street
An event which proved to bo 
the most impressive affair held 
thus far by any night school body, 
took place last Saturday evening 
at Thistle Hall. It was the last 
dance of the Night College of Fine 
Arts, and the high light of the 
evening was the coronation of Ber* 
nice Perry as queen of the May, 
amid colorful ceremonies.
Following an appropriate fan­
fare. the first night May Queen to 
he chosen by Carnegie Night Art 
students was led in the company 
of her attendants to a throne in 
the center of Thistle Hall. The 
setting was beautifully arranged 
amid numerous ferns, palms and 
roses.
Immediately following the cere­
mony of the coronation, the new 
queen, wreathed In a crown, was 
presented with a huge bouquet of 
roses while her attendants dis­
tributed llowers in her honor to all 
the ladies present. This custom of 
electing a May queen. It is hoped, 
will become traditional with the 
college.
The dance tloor too reflected the 
atmosphere of the line arts. Easels, 
water colors, oil paintings, and ar­
chitectural designs helped to com­
plete the decorative scheme. The 
entrance to the dance floor was 
Hanked 011 either side by stately 
palms.
The dance programs were in 
keeping with the general atmos­
phere of the occasion. It was in 
the form of a palette and marked 
a departure from the conventional 
forms.
Jack Tanzillo and his versatile 
group of musicians won the ac­
claim of the guest8 by their won­
derful music.
Guests and chaperons for the af­
fair were Miss Mary Watson 
Green, Dean of Women; Mr. and 
Mrs. Roy I-Iilton. and Mr. and Mrs. 
Raymond Simboli.

Other activities to interest the 
citizens of the campus, and this in­
cludes night students, are -all the 
doings of the annual Spring Car­
nival. This is a big week-end and 
affords all Carnegie . students 
abundant opportunities of enjoying 
themselves. Tickets are being sold 
to the students, so better get yours 
early. There will be doings on 
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, 
and in case you can’t attend all of 
them, even one of the affairs will 
justify the cost of the ticket.
P see we gyro-ed into the news 
lines again out at Schenley. Land­
ing on the familiar section of the 
campus known as the “Cut” this 
unique type of aircraft caused a 
commotion which claimed the in­
terest of a large number of cam- 
pusites. After landing and caus­
ing the stir, the whirligig- started 
its queer movement and climbed 
right up to where it came from and 
flew away to other parts. Why 
even the architects were drawn 
away from their ail absorbing 
boards to watch the mechanical 
pinwheel spin. There it is, that 
old bell sounding again. At first 
1 thought it was the call to dinner, 
but suddenly awoke to the fact 
that it was the bell to get off the 
air.—So, so long until—That was 
the Idle Night Student signing off 
until this time next week. The 
Tartan bids you all good night.
NewDevelopments 
In Steel Making
Some recent developments in the 
manufacture of iron and steel in­
dicate that the depression has not 
hampered research work and when 
the recovery comes the industry 
will be prepared for the advance 
which will inevitably follow.
One of the improvements is the 
Aston process for producing 
wrought iron. It has so often been 
described that it needs 110 intro­
duction. It is essentially a process 
whereby molten Bessemer steel, 
fully-blown, is “quenched” in mol­
ten slag prepared in an open 
hearth furnace.
A method of recovering pig iron 
from the slag run-off of blast fur­
naces has been developed. It con­
sists of centrifuging the molten 
slag and iron, whereupon the slag 
and iron separate. The siag is 
thrown from the lip of the vessel,
and is granulated by water sprays, 
while the iron, being heavier, forms 
an annular ring in the vessels and 
is removed when solid. Good re­
covery is claimed.
The centrifugal casting of an­
nular rings of steel, which are cut 
into arcuate sections and directly 
rolled, has been developed. The 
rings, about ten feet in diameter, 
are cast below floor level for safety, 
and the molten steel is poured di­
rectly into the rotating form. 
Sound bloom yields > of well over 
ninety per cent are claimed.
In addition to these mechanical 
•improvements, a host of new alloys 
and many new applications for ex­
isting products have been devel­
oped. Improvements in equipment, 
most noticeable of which are the 
growth of automatic control sys­
tems and the extended use of anti­
friction bearings have been made.
The resourcefulness of the iron 
and steel men probably accounts 
for the fact that the industry tra­
ditionally leads the parade to re­
covery.

SUPPOSE YOU 
TELL ME WHY 
YOU SMOKE 
GRANGER”
"WI
LL, it’s like this. Back in the old 
days, when men wore high hats and 
frock coats, they had plenty of time to 
think things out, and they had sense, too. 
They used to sit down on a log and take 
the time to whittle their tobacco from a 
plug, to be sure of having a cool smoke.
"In those days, a man named Wellman, 
right here in Quincy, 111., made about the 
best tobacco you could get. He knew how 
to keep the flavor fine and mellow.
"Well, sir, the people who make this 
Granger Rough Cut acquired Mr. 
Wellman’s meLhod, and they musL have 
known how the old boys used to whittle 
their tobacco to make il smoke cool. Yes, 
sir, this Granger is the real stuff. The 
same mellowness and fine flavor that 
Wellman used Lo hand out to his friends. 
And it’s whittled into big shaggy flakes 
all ready for the pipe. 'Rough Cut’ they 
call it—'cut rough to smoke cool’ is the 
best way I can describe it.
"Regardless of price, Granger is about 
the: best pipe tobacco I ever smoked. That’s 
why I smoke il, and lhat’g why they call 
it America’s Pipe Tobacco, sir.”
• • •
Now we wanted Lo sell Granger for 10)!. 
It was just a question of how to do it for 
the price. So we pack Granger in a sen­
sible foil pouch instead of an expensive 
package, knowing that a man can’t smoke 
the package. We give smokers this good
The Granger pouch, 
keeps the tobacco fresh
GRANGF.H tobacco in a cranmon-senac 
pouch for 10i‘.
GRANGER has not been on sale very 
long, but il. has grown to be a popular 
smoke. And there is this much about it— 
we have yet lo know of a man who started, 
to smoke it, who didn’t keep on. Folks 
seem lo like it.

Spring Carnival Days
Again Spring Carnival time rolls around—a time when 
students may relax, forget their studies for a day, and enjoy 
some of the best entertainment that is provided on the campus 
for the students during the school year. Two full days and 
three evenings filled with events to top the social season of the 
year constitute Carnival Week.
The committee has worked industriously to make the pro­
gram one of the most- interesting of Spring Carnival programs 
and committee members say that it will be hard to match the 
quality, character, and number of interesting events that have 
been planned. Several additions have been made to the pro­
gram ‘this year which should make the day events more in­
teresting. The Bacchanalians have been working with enthu­
siasm since last fall on “Over the Coals” and if the produc­
tion even parallels that of last year nothing more will be 
•desired.
No Carnival can be a success unless it is supported by all 
oi the students, because the Spring Carnival is planned for the 
•entire student body. The ,admission price of $1.50 a person 
ior the complete program places the entertainment within the 
reach of nearly everyone—“Over the Coals” itself will be 
worth the price asked for the entire program.
The committee members have given unstintedly of their 
time and energy to ensure’ a worthwhile and entertaining Car­
nival and it is left to the students to determine whether or not 
another Carnival will be held next year.
The Y Conference
Last week-end some 45 students and faculty members spent 
two and one-half days in the quietness and beauty of the tall 
timbers in Cook’s Forest in Clarion County discussing campus 
problems. It was the occasion of the third annual spring con­
ference and outing of the campus Y. M. C. A.
Too often at such conferences nothing but talk evolves 
and little or nothing is accomplished, but this conference was 
an exception. Such subjects as chapel programs, greater mix­
ing of fraternity groups, campus traditions, and the possibili­
ties of holding discussion groups to discuss current economic, 
political, and social problems were broached during some of 
the discussions. One of the most timely suggestions made dur­
ing the conference was that a large bell be placed on the cam­
pus to be rung for chapels. Another campus tradition it "was 
called. It was proposed that discussion luncheon meetings be 
held regularly which »'would be open to all students and at 
•which time a few minutes could be taken from the busy class­
room life to hear authorities and to discuss current subjects.
It is encouraging to know that the students at the confer­
ence gave serious consideration to freshman regulations, a 
tradition which will die if more concern is not manifested by 
the students.
There are no organizations on the campus 'which do more 
for the students nor have a more varied program than the 
ccY’s.” Although there are nearly twenty different services 
and activities performed and sponsored by the Y. M. C. A., the 
group of men actively interested in the work are continually 
seeking to widen the scope of the activities and increase the 
number of services rendered. Equally progressive is the Y. 
W. C. A. Organizations which adopt as their motto “Truth, 
Hohesty, and Service” are to be commended for their loyalty 
• and service to the student body.
Another Student Council Service
The Student Council has recently proposed to handle the 
funds of various campus organizations whose funds are not al­
ready handled by the Council. It is claimed that this new plan 
. wliich will in no way limit the nature of expenditures or the 
number, provided the expenditures do not exceed the amount 
deposited with the Council, will aid the honoraries and other 
organizations in keeping an accurate record of their accounts 
from year to year. In years past students have graduated and 
left bank accounts of honorary societies in their names which 
are forgotten.
The plan will in no way change the present independent 
control by the organization of its funds, in no way will the 
council have anything to do with determining how each fund 
shall be spent except to prevent debts to arise which cannot be paid.
No organization will, be asked to put its funds under Coun­
cil ; such action must be taken voluntary by each group. The 
Council is offering a service which we believe should be used by 
all campus organizations.
English Ways
By PROF. LEO T. LAWLER
English grauimer and rhetoric 
like other sciences and arts have 
their special and individual term­
inology to identity the ways of 
word formation, word combina 
tion, and sentence building. Some 
of these are well known—everyone 
recognizes ellipsis, allegory, per­
sonification, irony, tautology. Some 
are not so well known, though 
what they represent may be read­
ily understood. A setting down of 
some of the more obscure ones 
may prove interesting aud help­
ful.
Anadiplosis is the repetition of 
the last word of a sentence 
clause at the beginning of the next, 
with an adjunct idea. For example, 
consider “The slave wants free­
dom. Fredom for what?” ’
Epizenxis is the emphatic repeti 
tion of the same word, or words. 
An example of it is “Sad, sad. oh 
so sad!’'
Asyndeton means the omitting of 
connective words; whereas Poly­
syndeton means the repetition of 
them. An example of the first is 
“Be born, live, hope, die.” And 
one of the second is “The soldier 
has no material wants and no am­
bitions and no worries.”
Euphemism consists in the use 
of agreeable or non-offensive langu­
age to describe or to refer to some­
thing which is disagreeable or of­
fensive.- We sometime hear “darn" 
for “damn,” or “gosh” as a mild 
oath. The idea “death” has been 
handled gently by many writers. 
In Anglo-Saxon the word for “die" 
is “stenfan,” from which we get our 
"starve,” meaning “to need some­
thing.” Apparently the euphemism 
lies in the thought that “the dead 
need liie.” Nowadays we hear the 
rather flat “He has passed away."
Litetes is affective in that it in­
dicates a strong affirmative by the 
use of a negative before a noun oi- 
an adjective. “The living of a nor­
mal life is no idle business.” “The 
Pilgrims were no ordinary men.”
Hypotyposis is on of the most 
striking of all the figures of 
rhetoric. It requires vividness and 
concreteness, and consequently a 
lively imagination. It is the rep­
resentation of the absent in sucn 
realistic, forceful, and colorfut 
terms as to make it seem present. 
“The awful and agonized cries of 
the early Christian martyr, as he 
died in the flame of his torturers», 
tell again the story of man’s In­
humanity to man”—is an example 
of the figure defined.
Students who are interested In 
developing their literary powers 
may find the few foregoing kinds of 
rhetorical forms the source of in­
spiration for the purposes of imi­
tation or further investigation.

Over the Coals” will be pre­
sented at the Pitt Theater May 
12th aud 13th. The first perform­
ance will be open to the public, 
and the second will be given for

The Bacchanalians give the fol­
lowing explanation for the choice 
of the unusual name which their 
organization bears. The show is 
presented at the annual Spring 
Carnival, which is a reflection of 
the spring festivals of ancient 
Greece, dedicated to the god Bac­
chus. Plays, including choral com­
edies, were part of the festivities 
on these occasions, so that the de­
rivation and application of the 
name Bacchanalians to Carnegie’s 
organization is both apt and his­
torically correct.

SAILING, SAILING—
Last Friday night when the boys and girls 
boarded the good ship Washington to sail down 
the Ohio for the Fifth Annual Men’s Dormitory 
Boat Dance it was a genuine case of water, water 
everywhere. The rain, however, failed to dampen 
the spirits of the crowd and merrymaking was in 
order throughout the evening.
Chief features of the eveuing were the short 
intervals during which it wasn’t raining, passing 
through the locks, watching the boat set sail (no 
one was left 
waving at the 
pier), and the 
grand march 
with hats and 
life savers be­
ing passed out 
as favors. The 
music of Ted­
dy Blake and 
his SS. Wash­
ington orchestra coupled ,with the fact that the 
door was packed in the middle added much to 
the gaiety of the evening.
Of course the dance was attended by all the 
notables. Vic Mathis, Floyd Hartshorn, Pal 
Miller, Frank Sclmeller (by the way Frank won 
the distinction of being last on board), Bill 
Burns, Francis Giolma, and Art Sehai, too. The 
evening saw some of the campus’s more promin­
ent couples separated temporarily or, or what? 
We mustn’t forget the girls. Tippy Varner was 
there as was Ruth Iiornbeck, the Kloos sisters, 
Helen Murray, Libby Carlin, and Louise McCain.* * # * *
LOCAL BOY MAKES GOOD—
When tljie home town lad makes good at col­
lege it’s big news for the local newspaper. Our 
big athletes get their share and some of our 
more prominent dramats also get frequent write­
ups but few, if any, can match clippings with 
John Clifton Carr of Lynbrook, New York. Poor 
Clif fell victim of the pen of a former friend now 
a reporter and none of the trimmings were omit­

Of course the copy was front page stuff with 
a picture resurrected from the high school an­
nual of June ’30 gracing the most conspicuous 
position on the page. Starting with the supris- 
ing headline of “Named Head of Phi Beta Kap­
pa” the story went on to tell of the many honors 
that had been heaped on the brow of young Cliff 
with a few exagérations such as calling him a 
Captain in the R. O. T. C. when in reality he Is a 
sergeant. How he was named president of Phi 
Beta Kappa (this honorary does not exist on 
this campus) instead of president of Industries 
Senate, Cliff himself wonders.
Not content with the account, of his college 
laurels the writer ferreted out his birthplace and 
tracked him from kindergarten through high 
school. Well, well, you’ve got to pay the price!
RUMOR PERSISTS—
.That the M. A. S. held a reunion at the recent 
Phi Kappa Formal.
That the same formal brought out the fact that 
Tony “The Baron” Cacchione knew that his date 
lived in the second house from the corner. The 
¿inly thing that kept him late was the rather 
large number of corners.
That John Kronenberg has become a sahdwich 
man during the moments he can spare from his 
campus duties. Ask Marion McNary about the 
sign he was exhibiting last Saturday.
That during the forthcoming Carnival “The 
People” are going to step out in the very latest * 
neat but not gaudy mess jacket ensembles.
That Lou Jagnow sent the last Delta Skull * 
meeting into an uproar by announcing that he 
had to leave-to visit his car several times during 
the course of the evening.* * * * *
IT WON’T BE LONG NOW—
Until the “Queen” and all her little helpers 
(don’t miss it) will be putting on their little act 
to open festivities.
Until the faculty behind the pitching of “Doc” 
Marks takes on the seniors’ mushbaU team 
Such well known “Profs” as Lawler, I-Iobe, Gustaf­
son, Pugh, Davenport and Fryer will enter into 
combat with Tom Coulter's Cap and Gowners.
And speaking of Tom it won’t be long until he 
aids the Mortar Boards with their annual tree 
planting stunt. After his recent rendition of Mr. 
Kilmer’s famous work at the Fulton Theater, the 
oilier night, he got the job without so much as 
an audition.
MORE ABOUT THE CARNIVAL—
The first big surprise of the week-end comes 
when the sweepstakes cars line up in the heats 
Friday. A couple of the Clyde Street houses are 
said to have new ones while the other house from 
the North lent their car to a Pitt house and 
had it wrecked this past week.
Probably the most anticipated event of the 
week will be the show. When the curtain goes 
up at the Pitt next Saturday, the students will 
see one of the finest co-ed musical reviews ever 
staged by a college group. Some of the music 
is well above the par set. by our popular songs 
and sheet music of the scores will be sold at. a 
surprisingly reasonable figure. Puppet will in­
clude eight pages of, the songs in Thursday’s 
issue.
The Messrs. Beatty, Janies, Davis and Schmertz 
will make up the tennis team that meets the 
seniors after the mushbaU battle Friday.

HERE AND THERE—
Half a dozen dramats had their pictures in the 
evening paper last week illustrating the difficul­
ties one might run into in trying to identify ma­
jors and minors. The story said their ages 
ranged from seventeen to twenty-four. This is a 
wonderful chance for the old gag about the best 
five years of any girl’s life are the ones when she 
is seventeen but it seems the facts were true.
Some of the residents of upper Forbes street 
were rather surprised to see three young ladies 
attired in their most paint besmirched smocks 
mowing the grass beside one of the fraternity 
houses. The girls were working for their sup­
per and when the time came to eat it they grew a 
little bit frightened and begged their departure 
because of their appearance.
Last week-end Lee Nutter and Peggy Neidring- 
liouse were ojit tripping the light fantastic. The 
orchestra, as orchestras invariably do from time 
to time, struck up a bit of a tango after the 
evening had gotten along a bit. Our charming 
young couple started in a very inconspicuous 
manner to improvise a few steps. After the num­
ber was over and they had returned to their 
table, several people came over to tell them how 
well they thought they had danced together and 
soon quite a crowd had gathered ’round. Con­
gratulations soon turned to pleadings and before 
they knew it. the couple had given their names 
as Mr. and Mrs. Billingsworth. In a few minutes 
they were out. 011 the tloor by themselves doing a 
specialty. Best of all was the pretty manner in 
which Lee blushed when a sweet young tiling- 
said in a stage whisper, “Don’t you think he 
looks like Rudolph Valantlno?”
Wait, till you see the crime club in this year’s 
Thistle—a brand new stunt that will lend spice 
to the feature section this year. Who knows, 
you may be a member?
The boys down at the field house are still tell­
ing the one about Bert treating an ailing athlete 
for some twenty minutes only to have it turn 
out that the other leg was the injured one.

Graduate Doubts Efficacy
Of Anti-War Pledges
Urges Students Unite in 
Opposition to War
Ediitor, the Carnegie Tartan:
In the Tartan of April 25, you 
asked the students of Tech whether 
or not they are to sign the 
pledge not to bear arms except in 
case of invasion, and whether this 
action will do anything to bring 
about even temporary world peace. 
I should like to voice my opinion 
on the subject, even though I am 
a graduate.
In my contacts with Carnegie 
students, I have found that, with 
some exceptions,-there is sincere 
anti-war sentiment among them. 
The exception, I recall, were R. O. 
T. ,C. men anxious to carry out the 
purpose for which they have been 
trained, and which promises them 
much “glory.” The rest, while -sin­
cerely opposed to war, include some 
students who feel that war is hate­
ful, but do not recognize its im­
minence; on the contrary, they 
feel that resistance is utterly fu­
tile, and that it must come at some 
time. The others in this second 
group fear war and would like to 
do something about it, but cannot 
choose a course of action. It is 
with the latter type of student that 
I am in sympathy, but with the 
former that I am to some extent in 
agreement, as I shall show.
The student who is not too deep­
ly immersed in his work to take 
an occasional glance at our eco­
nomic system is aware that capi­
talism is now in an extremely im­
perialistic stage in which nations 
are forced to reach out into each 
other’s territories to supplement 
the saturated home markets and 
depleted natural resources. I need 
not stress the rise of “monopoly­
capital” as the modern influence 
which is driving the manipulators 
of such capital in each country to 
depend on war as the only way out 
of “depressions.” Capitalism, one 
can readily agree, is the cause 
of economic crises, and these crises 
hasten war; hence we can say that, 
under the existing system, war Is 
inevitable. The hope that interna­
tional agreements will prevent war 
has been proved again and again 
to be built 011 incorrect premises; 
further hope in that direction 
should be discarded if we are to 
do something at once. The sham 
character of disarmament confer­
ences is exposed by the numerous 
armed conflicts going 011 now in 
many parts of the world; while the 
“peaceful” occupation of China by 
Japan points toward a major con­
flict between Soviet Russia and 
Japan—the latter country, in my 
opinion, furnishing the provocation 
for such an event.
With this brief analysis in mind, 
I agree that a war “must come,” 
but only as an inherent phenome­
non of capitalism. (The facts also 
make me wonder how you can write 
about “temporary world peace!”] 
But let’s return to the students 
who want a way out.
These students are viewing in 
bewilderment the host of anti-war 
schemes which I have mentioned, 
a.nd are now being presented with 
a pledge. The pledge means that 
students, acting as individuals and 
on the assumption that the rest of 
the student body will support them 
as individuals, will promise to re­
frain from bearing arms. I oppose 
this limiting of student expression 
against war to individual action; to 
the signing of a pledge and then 
having done with the matter. For, 
even assuming that independent 
editors will write against a war, 
how can we be sure that the pro­
paganda of our subsidized journals 
and papers will not split the ranks 
of our passive colleagues as they 
did in the last war, pushing some 
into battle and leaving the others 
behind as “passion-backed mar­
tyrs” to be hung up by the thumbs 
in jail? War propaganda Is carried 
011 not only a few weeks before a 
war, we have jlngoslsts now 
aplenty who are Influencing stu­
dents. We have R. O. T. C. units 
where war is taught! And will 
our educators defy the money bar­
ons by asking students to carry out 
their pledge I don’t think so, 
their positions are at stake. To 
summarize: A pledge, as a means 
of combating war, will not alone be 
effective. Only after college stu­
dents have formed a genuine anti­
war ORGANIZATION, which will, 
by means of a positive program, 
crystalize the sentiment of the stu-
Instructor Claims World 
Moves Toward Pcace
dents and teach them wliat to do 
at the instant war breaks out—only 
then will antiwar feeling be turned 
into the channel of action.
But all is not yet said. You have 
asked: Shall we pledge to bear
arms only in case of invasion? If 
we should, might we not be sub­
scribing to a scheme which can de­
feat its anti-war purpose? I can­
not see what guarantee there is 
that any war into which we might 
enter will not be one of offense in­
stead of defense. Can we expose the 
machinations of our militarists at 
any time before we shoulder arms? 
I thing not, for every subsidized 
paper will shout about the “invad­
ing enemy” cleverly enough to 
cover an offensive war, while hon­
est sources of intelligence will be 
squelched. Remember that to pre­
vent invasion we shall require mil­
itary “protection” beforehand, so 
that if we agree with t'he pledge 
entirely, we must accept militari­
zation and the maintenance of 
armaments, all of which can as 
easily be used for attack as for de­
fense. We may not necessarily be 
able to judge the intentions of our 
war-leaders even from a knowl 
edge of fleet-maneuvers, “inva­
sion” can come- from Mexico or 
Canada. To summarize: Our
pledge could conceivably be used 
as a blind to send us into a war I11 
which wo shall be aggressors. 
Only in case of genuine invasion 
should wo consent to become can­
non fodder; and it is for the pur­
pose of analyzing and combating 
such , imperialistic designs which 
may be up the sleeves of our war­
mongers that I suggest the forma­
tion of an honest, energetic anti­
war organization at Carnegie (as 
a starter for a national group.)
In conclusion, my consideration 
of the question leads me to doubt 
the efficacy of a mere pledge, 
and to suggest the formation of 
an integrated group of interested 
students. Several other serious 
problems arise as a result of my 
analysis, but I shall be glad to 
discuss these questions with other 
students through your columns and
to help them form such a group as 
I have described. B. E. M.

Editor, the Carnegie Tartan:
It was with deep Interest and no 
little surprise that I read your edi­
torial of April 25, 1933, entitled 
“To War Against War.” 1 do not. 
quarrel with your condemnation 
of the attitude of the Brown Daily 
Herald, for indeed your opinion, 
as such, is as valid as any other. 1 
do question, however, your state' 
ment that nothing has been done 
and nothing ever will be done to 
insure international peace. Your 
statement, 1 believe, constitutes a 
misreading of the past and reveals 
an over-pontifical attitude con­
cerning the future. The past few 
years has witnessed the growth of 
an international public opinion so 
powerful that even Japan finds 
it essential to explain its actions 
and German leaders hesitate to 
loose too completely the dogs of per­
secution. The League of Nations, 
the World Court, the Kellog treat­
ies, the recent conversations in 
Washington, what, shall we say of 
them? Let us admit that they 
have been weak. Ineffective, and 
disappointing, but none or us can 
deny that they are. at the very 
least, attempts to uplift and civil­
ize mankind. Their mere existence 
refutes your statement that noth­
ing has been done. One has but 
to contrast Louis XIV Avit.li Her- 
riot, or Henry VIII with Ramsay 
MacDonald to perceive the enorm­
ous distance tlio world has tra­
versed, with all the attendant re­
versions to the 'jungle. As to the 
future, how can any of us dare to 
predict that nothing ever will bo 
done to insure international peace? 
All history is a refutation of the 
word “itnppssible?.”
Sincerely yours,

The Tartan editorial referred to 
stated: “In Europe the coals of
disagreement are warm; they are 
near the kindling temperature. Pro­
posals for peace have been made, 
disarmament suggested, equality of 
power in military strength propos­
ed, but nothing has be.cn done. 
Nothing ever will bo done that will 
ensure International peace; there 
are too many nations dominated 
by demagogues and irrational po­
tentates who are bent on promul­
gating personal and nationalistic 
Interests.”

Editor, The Carnegio Tartan:
I read with interest, but quite a 
little apprehension, your “War 
Against Wars” editorial of a week 
ago. As Voltaire says, “I disagree 
with everything you say but. recog­
nize your right to say it” or some­
thing to that effect.
The ideals of youth are Indeed 
commendable but the experience 
of age is the tempering influence 
that, keeps them within bounds. 
And experience proves that 110 un­
prepared nation can avoid war by 
its unpreparedness.
And now comes “A Student” in 
this week’s Tartan who endorses 
such a movement. He states 
“Some courageous and broadminded 
students have- already signed a 
pledge not to bear arms,” etc. In 
other words they have taken “the 
Slacker’s Oath.” He goes 011 “They 
are ready to spring to the defense 
of America,” etc. To what and 
with what will they spring? Wil­
liam Jennings Bryan lulled us to 
sleep with some such nonsense 
about 20 years ago and at the pres­
ent. moment we are paying the 
tiddler for having danced to the 
tune of unpreparedness.
If the. Tartan wishes to foster a 
real, worth-while movement and of 
great importance in the present 
state of muddled foreign affairs, 
let the Tartan climb on the band 
wagon of National Defense. Let it 
foster a recruiting campaign for 
the R. O. T. C. and a campaign for 
an adequate Army and Navy. I 
suggest the Tartan staff dust off a 
1918 and 1919 Thistle and look over 
the names of some real heroes.

Vocal cords 
made of coal!
Typical of Western Electric care and precision 
in manufacturing Bell Telephone apparatus, is the 
making of the transmitter button which transforms 
spoken words into electrical impulses.
This transmitter button—the telephone’s vocal 
cords—contains coal. Only a fine grade of se­
lected anthracite, specially treated, is suited for 
this delicate work. First the coal is ground into 
fine granular form —next it is carefully sifted and 
washed. Then, after being roasted in special ovens, 
it is put into the transmitter button. Approxi­
mately 50,000 tiny grains must go into each button 
—too few or too many would impair transmission.
Such infinite care with “little things” is one rea­
son why Bell System apparatus serves so faithfully..
