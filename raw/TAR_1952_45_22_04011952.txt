Rat Hoards Residing In Bowl 
Swooned By Barracks Piper
Out of the depths of the cornboard shacks that line the east rim 
of the Tech bowl now and then comes a story that either shocks or 
amuses the whole campus. The latest can be taken both ways; but 
here’s the way it was told to the Tartan’s roving reporter.
Late one night last week one of*--------------------------------------------------------
the energetic freshmen (only 
freshmen live in the barracks) 
who had completed his homework 
earlier than usual was trying to 
get some bagpipe practice in be­
fore his customary sunrise bed­
time. As he blew merrily away on 
his chanter with the window part­
ly open, he heard a gentle tapping 
(as of someone rapping, rapping at 
his chamber door).
Quick Decision
After running into the hall and 
finding nothing the matter, he flew 
to the v/indow and threw up the 
sash—but that was his mistake— 
for almost instantaneously a hoard 
of rats descended upon the room. 
The poor frosh didn’t know what
Prexy Reveals 
Appointments
Committee Appointed 
To Appoint Appointers
At a speciai meeting of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology 
board of trustees at the University 
grill last night, President J. C. 
Warner announced the appoint­
ment of a new faculty committee 
to appoint faculty committees to 
appoint faculty committees.
Chosen on the newly organized 
group were Prof. Finley Erg of 
the department of physics, profes­
sors G. N. Product of the econom­
ics department, Miss Umlaut of 
the department of modern lan­
guages, and Instructor Diphthong 
of the Department of English.
Arthur Arton Archipelago, a 
graduate of Novaya Zemlya Insti­
tute of Technology has been ap­
pointed to a position on the 
school's natural resources depart­
ment. Other new appointments 
were: Medulla Oblongata, instruc­
tor, department of Siamese biol­
ogy; Herman Sostenuto, instruc­
tor in music, and Morton S. 
Schrupff, Porter Hall janitor.
to do; but he realized that if the 
rats remained in the room very 
long, they would eat their way 
through the thin walls and soon 
engulf the whole barracks.
Being a student of the Carnegie 
Plan, our plebe friend immediately 
recalled the story of the Pied Pip­
er; and so, with chanter in hand, 
he leaped out the window and be­
gan to toot. In about five minutes 
he has his room cleared and 
crawled into bed, apparently little 
affected by the whole situation.
Too Much
This whole story was a little too 
much for the Tartan’s reporter, 
and so he proceeded to investigate 
further. As could have been ex­
pected, there was no one up at 
that hour, and thus no witnesses 
to the actual occurrence.
However, he talked with the 
cook at a nearby fraternity house, 
and she readily supported the fact 
that there were hoards of rats in 
the neighborhood by the hole in 
her shoe and other tales. She also 
disclosed an interesting story 
about an exterminator who refus­
ed to rid the house of rats when 
he noticed the Bowl’s garbage- 
cluttered hillside.
Is All False?
Then he talked to some of the 
married couples in the quarters 
next to the barracks and learned 
that many mothers were afraid to 
let their children roam outside, 
fearing the consequences of the 
rat-infested hill.
The truth of the CIT pied piper 
tale was never proven, and our re­
porter erased the issue as an 
April Fool’s prank; but then, what 
about the hillside? Maybe that 
part of the story was true, who 
knows?
Carnegie’s Student Council was called into special session be­
hind locked doors at Harry’s Tavern last Saturday evening. The 
handful of Council members present (including J; A. Dickinson, the 
only person who has served more than four consecutive semester* 
on the governing body) showed#-

considerable concern over the 
current general strike for parity 
grades.
The conditions of the strike, for 
those readers of the Tartan who 
are currently on sabbatical leave, 
are as follows. A large group of 
irate students, mainly from the 
departments of glass-blowing and 
doily-weaving, have set up violent

Black Magic Interest 
Fosters Voodoo Study
By Rene Descartes
According to a recent announcement by Dr. Amos Alonzo Faust, 
head of the Carnegie department of voodoo and sorcery, increased 
student interest in black magic has brought about the inclusion of 
several new department courses, and the hiring of some additional 
instructors. ?--------------------------------------------------------
To be added to the required 
courses for CIT freshmen are 
college voodoo and sorcery 
(V221), and origins of technolog­
ical voodoo I and II (V705, 
V706). These courses will take ef­
fect with the incoming class next 
September.
Elective Courses 
For interested upper classmen, 
the following new courses are of­
fered: advanced calculus and
functions of complex voodoo I; 
advanced calculus and functions 
of complex voodoo II; history of 
American industrialized voodoo; 
voodoo analysis; elementary sci­
entific voodoo; intermediate sci­
entific voodoo; voodoo literature; 
qualitative voodoo; electricity and 
voodoo; 17th century voodoo; 18th 
century voodoo; 19th century voo­
doo; 20th century voodoo; con­
temporary voodoo, and elements 
of voodoo for electrical enginters.
The department has announced 
that pins, dolls, dried lizards, 
newts, frogs, amulets, and assorted 
broths, brews, and charms will be 
supplied to the students at no ex­
tra fee.
V&S Courses Switched 
Also a part of the general de­
partmental shakeup, the six 
courses formerly under the juris­
diction or V&SS has been incor­
porated into the department of 
alchemy and metaphysics, under 
Drl E. C. Ztuerc. Courses offered 
by the new department include: 
basic medieval torture (primarily 
for fraternity pledgemasters); 
phlogiston theory; philosopher’s 
stone analysis; origin of the four 
elements, and others.
Dean Jones’ office has announc­
ed that all students wishing to 
switch to one of these two super- 
natural relations departments 
must wait until the beginning of 
next semester.
Kant to Speak
Immanuel Kant, who has 
gained some recognition as an 
itinerant matador and author 
of children’s stories, will visit 
the Carnegie campus next 
Tuesday to speak to the fac­
ulty and students. His sub­
ject, “1800 Years on a Life 
Raft and How I Survived”, is 
of particular interest in these 
troubled times. All provosts 
and deans, particularly those 
who have been frequently 
reprimanded for corrupting 
student morals, are urged to 
attend.
protests over the distribution of 
grades to CIT students.
Inequalities
Their demand is a system of 
subsidized grading, guaranteeing 
students a minimum grade on the 
1909 to 1913 level, thus eliminat­
ing the great inequalities current­
ly existent in grading, particularly 
noticeable in the difference in 
grades received by four factor and 
one factor students. Said Ferruccio 
O’Houlihan, spokesman for the 
strikers, “I see no reason why a 
four factor student should get any 
better grades than I do.”
Other Business
On the other side of the fence, 
representatives of the Carnegie 
IBM office state that the school’s 
system of grade control would be 
completely ruined by the proposal, 
and that inflation would probably 
result from the inauguration of 
such a plan. “Our machines simply 
cannot stand any higher grades 
than are now being given,” he 
stated.
While deliberating the matter. 
Student Council also cons lored 
revoking the constitution of the 
Campus Uplift Society, a branch 
of the Pittsburgh Purity League, 
as a part of its general clean-up 
campaign among campus organ­
izations. Also, such action helps to 
fill pages in Council’s minute 
book.
Clamor Grows 
For New Band 
At Carnival
According to uninformed 
sources, a petition of over 1500 
signatures has been presented to 
Carnegie Tech’s Spring Carnival 
committee, asking for a change in 
the nature of music and dancing at 
this year’s Carnival.
Although there is no official 
comment as yet, it has been hint­
ed that the petition has urged that 
George Shearing be contracted to 
play for the formal dancfe on Fri­
day night.
The petition continued to de­
mand the inclusion of a substantial 
number of minuets, gavottes, ma­
zurkas, and Hungarian folk 
dances.
Popular sentiment for the 
change reached a peak at last 
year’s Carnival when students 
were generally disgruntled over 
the selection of Ray Anthonv, 
Ralph Flanagan, and Stan Kenton 
as musicmakers for the big Spring 
weekend.
One student’s reaction was typi­
cal: “Even Spike Jones would be 
better than those jerks. Back to 
j the good old days I say—what this 
campus needs is more polkas and 
folk dances.”
NEW MEN S DORM
Shown above is the ornate facade of McBoss hall, new men’s 
dorm, which was donated to Carnegie Tech by Campus Cleaners 
In collaboration with the Oakland Security and Truss Company. It 
is hoped that this modern addition to the dormitory system will help 
replace the degenerating barracks.
In the foreground of the picture is seen John J. John, Jr., noted 
author, lecturer, and world traveler, striding resolutely up the walk 
after a hard day’s work in the alchemy lab.
All Girls:
Any FA or MMCC women 
interested in serving their 
country while still in college 
are urged to contact Warrant 
Officer PayCheck in the Mili­
tary Department office on or 
before April 19, about serving 
as campfollowers for the Car­
negie ROTC detachment. Suit­
able compensation will be 
supplied.

Since students have been

elimination of smoking in the 
Annex stack area (regulation 
dictated by insurance regula­

restrictions on its use for 
study purposes.
Until further notice the 
stack will be locked at 5 p.m. 
weekdays and at 12 noon Sat­
urdays. The desk assistant 
will obtain specific books if

Evidence of further disre­

of all study facilities from the 
area. Students are reminded 
that smoking is permitted in 
the reading room.

they found that some of their more 
dull-witted brethren had prepared 
a series of surprises for them.
Trash receptacles stood in front 
of hall doors; buckets of water 
were propped up to spill when 
doors were opened; all lights were 
out; Pepsi bottles were strewn on 
the lounge floor; telephones were 
out of order; and doors were bar­
ricaded with couches, Pepsi cases,

had been stolen.
To stop the ringing of the false

gave their whole-hearted approv­
al, and Larry Glavin was appoint­
ed chairman for the concert.
Council also considered in de­
tail the parking situation at CIT m 
an effort to find a solution to the 
many student complaints about 
inadequate facilities. Norma 
Trust, appointed to look into this 
problem, gave her report, in which 
she stressed that due to lack of 
funds the school plans no further 
improvements. To relieve the sit­
uation somewhat, she suggested 
that fraternity and dormitory men 
be requested not to drive their 
cars to school. This suggestion was 
accepted and a letter will be sent 
to fraternity presidents and the 
Dorm Council.
Chapels Discussed
The almost non-existent at­
tendance at chapel programs was 
also thrashed over, with several 
suggestions for improvement be­
ing offered. Norman Trust propos­
ed that interested groups on cam­
pus be asked to sponsor a chapel 
each year, but this idea was re­
jected.
Dick Durstine offered the opin­
ion that fewer chapels might be in 
order. It soon became apparent, 
however, that Council needed 
more of the facts of the problem 
to reach any definite conclusions. 
Ronnie Curhan and Norma Trust 
were appointed co-chairman o_f a

Bloodmobile * Visit 
Yields 95 Pints, 
Miss Goal By 30
The American Red Cross blood-

sult of the days work was a total 
of approximately 95 pints of blood 
collected. Nearly 60 persons who 
showed up, moreover, w.ere re­
jected mostly because of flu sick­
ness within the last month.
Volunteers were signed up in 
Skibo last Wednesday—there were 
187. The aim of the unit visit was 
125 pints.
This is the first visit the Blood- 
mobile has paid to Carnegie since 
December. The unit travels 
throughout western Pennsylvania, 
eastern and southern Ohio, and 
northern West Virginia. It includes 
5 nurses, a traveling doctor, and 
two blood custodians.

Baker Begins Spring 
Football Drill In Bowl
The Tech Bowl began to ring with excitement Monday as the 
Tartan football team entered its spring football training. The echo 
“hit ’em harder” will be the traditional cry for the next three 
weeks. ?—--------------------------------------------------
Coach Eddie Baker and his as­
sistants will be out there to re­
move the winter’s accumulation of 
fat and liquid on stomachs which 
seem to be pronounced protrosions 
on most members of the team.
The coaching staff will be look­
ing over replacements for the po­
sitions vacated by the graduating 
seniors and the positions where 
the Tartans were weak last season. 
The seniors that will be missing 
are John Luchok, Fritz Wilson, 
George Rusnak, Quentin Holtz, 
Ted Lehman, Arne Oberg, Bob 
Odeh, and Dale Startzell.
In addition to the seniors the 
team will be missing Herman 
Whitenight, who was drafted in 
January. There is’ the possibility 
of other vacancies arising due to 
scholastic and transfer reasons.
Because of these numerous 
vacancies, Baker and his assist­
ants, hope the “huskies” on the 
Skibo campus will volunteer to 
support the football team by ap­
pearing at the locker room and 
asking for a football uniform and 
a chance to show their sportsman­
ship.
Tech To Have Baseball Team; 
Alumni Donate Equipment
School Cannot Finance Sport This Year;
Will Support IS ext Year If Spirit Is Shown
After two years without success, student organizers of a Carnegie 
baseball team have taken the initial step toward putting baseball on 
the varsity schedule of Tartan sports.
Plans were announced last week of the formation this spring of 
Carnegie’s first baseball team since^--------------------------------------------------------
1923.
Although sanctioned by the ad­
ministration as an official sport, 
baseball, financially, will be on 
its own this year with students 
and alumni bearing the cost. 
Alumni have donated most of the 
required equipment and players 
will provide their own shoes, 
gloves, and transportation to 
games.
For practice sessions and games 
the team has secured the use of

Tartan Grapplers 
End Competition 
Without Victory
Carnegie’s intramural grapplers 
ended their brief fling at intercol­
legiate competition last Friday 
with a 14-13 loss to the Pitt frosh. 
It marked the third straight defeat 
without a single win for the mat- 
men.
Except for the absence of their 
regular entry in the heavyweight 
class, the Tartans might have eked 
out a narrow win rather than a 
one point loss. The grunt-and- 
groan athletes from Carnegie 
gained some consolation from the 
meet as they copped an exhibition 
match not counting toward meet 
score.
The contestants for Carnegie in 
the inter-college competition were 
intramural winners and included:
Edward Hromanik, 127 lb. class, 
Demons.
James Valias, 137 lb. class, Beta 
Theta Pi.
Bill Brusallis, 147 lb. class, 
Demons.

Although the Duquesne “Dukes” won no prizes at the National

crown at Intramural Nite, Friday, March 21.

Dukes” from the American League 
soundly trounced Delta Upsilon 
“A”, 52-25, for an undefeated sea­
son record and the coveted all- 
i^hool championship.
Never Headed 
Jumping into an early lead, the 
Little Sekuds never left the out­
come of the game in doubt. From 
the end of the first quarter they 
capitalized on DU errors and fouls 
while their opponents were unable 
to solve the Sekud defense.
Previously in the semi-final 
round the DU’s had defeated the 
Rockets and the Sekuds, the 
li’aekhawks to gain admittance to 
tne championship final.
DU’s Top Bowling 
In bowling the DU’s fared better 
last week as they defeated the 
Raiders by 176 pins at the Univer­
sity Alleys, Saturday, to gain the 
intramural bowling crown. In reg­
ular season play the Raiders were 
runers-up to Delta Upsilon in the 
Strike League.
Dick Brent and Bob Oden'were 
keglers in the DU attack as the 
team set a high game record for 
the season of 917 pins. The new 
mark erased the old one of 891 set 
by the Raiders and bettered the 
DU’s own record of 875.
In the semi-final round, Delta 
Upsilon defeated Beta Theta Pi,

An individual contest saw Don

display, Braun came from behind 
to win over TX, Jack Rugheimer,

Swimming Meet
Kappa Sigma joined the list of 
IM winners with a conquest of 
the swimming meet held Tuesday, 
March 25. The Kappa Sigs copped 
both relays and added two indi­

runner-up with 31 points and Phi

In the individual events A1

where Jim Alemany of Kappa

Good As Carman 
Sets Tech Record
Coach Guy T. Halferty’s pros­
pects for the coming track season 
were heightened last Saturday by 
the outstanding performance 
turned in at South Park by Bob 
Carman, co-captain of the cross 
country team who is figured as 
one of the mainstays of this 
spring’s frack squad.
Running in the indoor mile at 
the AAU meet, Carman placed 
fourth with a performance of 4:29. 
Halferty reported it the best time 
ever turned in for an indoor mile 
by a Carnegie athlete.
Halferty, who is still looking for 
men to replace vacancies left by 
last year’s seniors Fred Price, Bill 
McKibbin, and Connie Hammann, 
announced that a tryout for all in­
terested candidates will be held 
Wednesday, April 2, at 4:30 p.m. 
in the Bowl.
The Tartans first home meet of 
the season will be Saturday, April

of Remington Feeny
Remington Feeny’s money went to his feet. 
Being extremely cautious, he hid his money in 
his shoes so he could always keep it with him. 
By the time he was 48, he was nine feet tall.
Money can be used to grow on, but not neces­
sarily by Mr. Feeny’s method. For instance, 
more than 1,100,000 people have shown their 
faith in the future of the Bell Telephone System 
by investing their money in it. About one-fifth 
of them are Bell employees who bought stock 
through a payroll savings plan.
It takes both money and people to keep the 
Bell System growing and improving to meet 
our country’s telephone needs. That’s why col­
lege men with the right qualifications can find 
interesting opportunities with us—in engineer­
ing, research, operating and administration.

Four Faculty Members Honored 
With Half-Salary Cash Awards
Four outstanding teachers at Carnegie Institute of Technology 
today received awards equal to half their annual salaries plus ex­
penses for travel.
Winners of the first Carnegie Teaching Awards are: Norman
H. Dawes, associate professor of ?----------------------------------------------------------
history and chairman of the fine 
arts academic program committee;
David Moskovitz, professor of 
mathematics and supervisor of 
basic courses in mathematics; Ed­
ward R. Schatz, assistant professor 
of electrical engineering and of 
Industrial Management; and Mi­
riam A. Weikert, associate pro- 
pessor of home economics and head 
of its nursery school,
Rest or Travel 
In making the announcement,
President J. C. Warner said, “The 
awards were given to the four 
teachers who were most outstand­
ing both in the quality of their un­
dergraduate teaching as measured 
by Carnegie’s educational objec­
tives and in their influence upon 
the teaching of others.
“These awards,” explained Pres­
ident Warner, “are to be used to 
provide either two summers or one 
semester in which the recipients 
may rest, travel or do whatever
they decide would be of most value 
to them.”
Corporation Sponsors
The teaching awards are being 
given by the Carnegie Corporation 
of New York for a five-year 
period, in order to support Carne­
gie Tech in its development of the 
Carnegie Plan of Professional Ed­
ucation. Along with a solid pro­
fessional preparation, it under­
takes to give a broad education 
that will equip students to grow 
throughout their lives in profes­
sional and personal stature and as 
citizens, by teaching them how to 
learn under their own steam not 
only from books but from experi­
ence.
In addition to the present grant, 
the Carnegie Corporation of New 
York, which has no direct tie with 
Carnegie Tech here, gave $100,000 
two years ago to help finance the 
work of developing the Carnegie 
teaching program.

Artist Versus Engineer
A Conflict Of Interests
Grin And Bear It-- 
Rooming With A P&D
By Rfd Anderson
It is to those of you unfamiliar with the indiosyncrasies of 
members of the department of painting and design that this mes­
sage is directed. Since my incarceration in the hallowed halls of 
CIT, I have had the dubious honor of sharing my room with one 
of that exclusive and distinctive ?---------------------------------------------------------
set known as “those P&D’s.M
During this time I have become 
thoroughly acquainted with many 
of the innumerable vagaries of 
this particular sect, and feel my­
self called upon to pass them 
along to other hapless engineers 
who may someday find themselves 
in a similar predicament.
Outstanding Characteristic 
One characteristic of these bud­
ding artists which is quickly and 
easily distinguished is the absent- 
minded preoccupation with which 
they go about the tasks of every­
day life. So busily occupied are 
they with discovering the beauties 
of man and nature that they are 
continually in great peril of walk­
ing in front of a moving auto or 
truck.
They are taught to be alert to 
the world about them, but they are 
all too likely to miss the shapely 
maiden slinking along the other 
side of the street because they 
are studying the “interesting 
shape” of the building behind her. 
Routine Neglected 
The routine details of living are 
continually forgotten by those of

the" creative talent. (I was 
astounded one day not long ago 
when, while picking up my mail, 
the postmaster asked me when 
my roommmate was going to come 
in and pick up his ten Time 
a z i n e s and assorted mail.) 
Through it all they remain pro­
foundly contemptuous of the 
“slide-rule happy” engineer and 
his “terrible” mathematics.
Then there is that intangible 
something—that spark of genius 
which creates beauty from the 
common-place surroundings of ev­
ery day life. However, boon 
though it may be to the culture 
of the world, the creative insti^H 
at three in the morning (when 
it usually occurs) is strict­
ly a pain-in-the-neck to the en­
gineer who is trying to sleep. The 
instinct is also responsible for 
other “original” behaviour on the 
part of the P&D. (There was the 
day I walked into Skibo and found 
my roommmate on his back in 
the middle of the floor, sketch­
book in hand, capturing “atmo­
sphere.”) $
Innumerable Quirks
As I stated before, the eccen­
tricities of the P&D are innum­
erable; any complete chronicling 
of them would require volumes. 
Therefore, since space is limited, 
I shall discontinue my discourse 
for now, leaving my audience pro­
perly forewarned, I trust, against 
the hazards of a life with a P&D.

New Microfilm Study Facilities 
Being Acquired By Library
Research Material, English Texts 
To Be Available By Cheap Method
Scarce technical documents and books are now available on micro 
film, the science librarian, announced today.
In conjunction with the Naval Research section of the Library of 
Congress, the Science Library of Carnegie Tech has started its own
f---------------------------------—-------------------------------------naval research department.
Abstracts of documents not in 
print appear now in TIP, Techni­
cal Information Pilot, and in card 
ca^ogs along with the author’s 
naiiTe and subject.
Micro Cards 
Here at Tech the cards are cata­
logued under the company or cor­
poration responsible for the re­
search, under the author’s name, 
or by the subject.
These documents are printed on 
micro cards which are read 
through a micro card reader. The 
micro reader enlarges a 3" by 5" 
caifP, contaning 60 pages, to the 
full size page of a book.
European Scientific Notes 
Another means of getting infor­
mation is the European Scientific 
Notes, which contain abstracts of 
documents related to research in 
Europe. By writing to the Naval 
Research department in Washing­
ton, D.C., any information neces­
sary for a research project can be 
obtained.
|J..otostatic copies are also sent 
by the Naval Research department 
on subjects in any general field. 
Tech is receiving 800 cards weekly 
from the research department. All 
the material is free.
Collection of Plays 
In addition to Tech’s naval 
project, the main library is also 
purchasing micro cards of plays. 
Their collection win contain 4,000 
plays. Part of the collection will 
incfcd-e British plays to the 1800’s 
and American plays to the 1830’s.
A historic collection entitled the 
“Hakluit Series,” which covers 
diaries and reports of explorations, 
will be bought. Another purchase 
will include a collection of work 
for the English Department enti­
tled the Early English Text Soci­
ety Series.
Two-fold Advantage 
The use of micro film is a two­
fold advantage to libraries. Thou­
sands of books can be reduced in 
size by micro-film and stored in 
a card catalog case, the size of a 
drawer. Micro-film is also cheaper. 
Volumes which cost $2000 can be 
obtained in this new medium for 
less than $170.

Sharp character on campus — he’s not easily 
duped by deceptive devices! From the onset of 
the tricky cigarette tests, he knew there 
was one true test of mildness. Millions 
of smokers throughout America have learned, too!
It’s the sensible test . . . the 30-Day Camel 
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try Camels 
as your steady smoke, on a pack-after-pack, 
day-after-day basis. No snap judgments! Once 
you’ve tried Camels in your “T-Zone” (T for 
Throat, T/ Taste), you’ll see why...
After all the Mildness Tests
