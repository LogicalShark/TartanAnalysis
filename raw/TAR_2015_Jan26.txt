University revamps CMU.edu homepage
BRENT HEARD
Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s of?-
cial website has received a 
facelift.
Visitors to the site’s 
homepage are now greeted 
with a redesign that contin-
ues to feature news related 
to the university and links to 
sections of the website such 
as research, admissions, and 
student life. 
However, the new page 
features larger graphics and 
a more modern aesthetic 
that allows the user to scroll 
through stories and infor-
mation in a clear hierarchy. 
The university’s website was 
last redesigned in 2009, 
with the new homepage cre-
ated by a team within the 
university.
Amanda Berneburg, se-
nior associate director of 
online strategy for market-
ing and communications, 
described the goals of the 
redesign process as “a way to 
tell the CMU story in a mod-
ern way.” Berneburg empha-
sized that the new design is 
more compatible with mobile 
devices and is also structured 
“to touch upon many of the 
strategic priorities Dr. Suresh 
has spoken about.”
The homepage now con-
tains links to portions of the 
website devoted to Carnegie 
Mellon’s global presence, as 
well as a list of links discuss-
ing the university’s strategic 
initiatives including the Si-
mon Initiative, Brain Hub, 
the new Tepper Quadrangle, 
and others.
Berneburg called Carn-
egie Mellon’s homepage “the 
university’s front door to the 
world,” and explained that 
“this is meant to be an interim 
design.” She explained that 
the university is planning 
many further improvements 
and updates to portions of 
the website, though the de-
tails of a timeline or speci?c 
plans have not yet been made 
public.
Some portions of the web-
site, such as those for admis-
sions and university news, 
still contain pages in the 
same style as the previous 
homepage design. Berneburg 
said that the overall website 
redesign is an ongoing initia-
tive, and that the news sec-
tion of the website would be 
the next section to receive a 
design change.
Nominations open for Excellence in Theatre Education Award
CMU increases tuition by 3.38 percent
BRADEN KELNER
Contributing Editor
The cost of tuition, fees, 
and room and board is in-
creasing by 3.38 percent for 
the next academic year, an 
increase that is more than last 
year’s 2.91 percent increase 
but less than 2013-14’s in-
crease of 3.99 percent for in-
coming students. Altogether, 
next year’s fees will total about 
$63,240 for undergraduates.
Emailing the campus com-
munity on Jan. 14, Vice Presi-
dent for Campus Affairs Mi-
chael Murphy said that tuition 
for incoming undergraduates 
and students who enrolled in 
fall 2013 or 2014 will be set at 
$49,610 for the 2015-16 aca-
demic year, while room and 
board now cost $7,520 for a 
standard double room and 
$5,310 for a standard ?rst-year 
meal plan. Fees factoring into 
this total increase include a 
$150 transportation fee, which 
allows students access to Port 
Authority of Allegheny County 
services, and a $390 technol-
ogy fee, as well as a $250 activ-
ity fee and $10 media fee for 
undergraduate students. The 
media fee supports the Col-
legiate Readership Program, 
which gives students access to 
The New York Times, Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, and USA Today 
on campus. Graduate students 
will be charged a $206 activity 
fee without a media fee.
For 2014-15, tuition cost 
incoming students $48,030. 
The 2015-16 tuition cost marks 
a 3.29 percent increase from 
this academic year’s tuition 
cost. The activity fee cost $246 
this year, and next year’s cost 
is only $4 higher. Meanwhile, 
the transportation fee rose $30 
from this year’s $120 fee. The 
media fee remained the same.
Room and board rose $240 
from $7,280 and the meal plan 
fee rose $190 from $5,120.
Next year’s increase, as 
well as the 2014-15 increase, 
deviated from previous years 
in that the percentage of the 
increase was the same for 
both incoming students and 
upperclassmen. The 2013-14 
academic year’s increase 
implemented a tiered pric-
ing in which ?rst-year stu-
dents were hit with a larger 
increase (3.99 percent) while 
upperclassmen received a

Last year, Carnegie Mellon 
University became the exclu-
sive higher education partner 
of the Antoinette Perry Award 
for Excellence in Theatre. As a 
result, the next Tony Awards 
will feature a new category: 
The Excellence in Theatre Ed-
ucation Award. Nominations 
for the award are now open, 
and Carnegie Mellon will play 
a major role in granting this 
award.
The award is granted to 
one current K–12 educator 
or member of an accredited 
theatre organization whose 
of?cial responsibilities in-
clude, at least in part, the-
atre education. The award is 
unique in that the nomina-
tions are made by current and 
former students regardless 
of their own quali?cations, 
meaning that any theatre 
educator in the country could 
potentially win. The screen-
ing process is carried out by 
a panel of judges made up of 
Carnegie Mellon’s faculty, the 
American Theatre Wing, The 
Broadway League, and other 
organizations prominent in 
the world of theatre arts.
The award, according to 
the Tony Awards website, 
will recognize educators who 
“discover talented students, 
nurture them, inspire them, 
and set them off on a lifelong 
journey as theatre supporters 
and professionals.”
The partnership was an-
nounced last year in a pre-
broadcast announcement be-
fore the Tony Awards by Dan 
Martin, dean of the College of 
Fine Arts, along with Billy Por-
ter (CFA, ’91) and Paula Wag-
ner (CFA, ’69), who both grad-
uated from Carnegie Mellon 
and won a Tony in 2013 and 
received a nomination in 2014, 
respectively. Porter won the 
award in 2013 for Best Actor 
in a Musical for his role as Lola 
in Kinky Boots, while “Mothers 
and Sons,” a Best Play nomi-
nee in 2014, was produced by 
Wagner. During the ceremony, 
Carnegie Mellon alumni Matt 
Bomer (CFA, ‘01) and Zachary 
Quinto (CFA, ‘99) announced 
the award to viewers at home, 
as well as to the audience.
“People don’t always real-
ize ... that theatre has to be 
taught,” Jacquelyn Gutierrez, 
a junior scene design major, 
said. “It’s great we’re recog-
nizing that there are people 
who do that every day.”
Senior acting major Col-
leen Pulawski said that she 
found the new award and 
partnership “really amazing.” 
She also expressed ex-
citement about an increase 
in prominence for Carnegie 
Mellon as an institution in 
the world of theatre. “There’s 
never been an educational 
institution tied to the Tony 
Awards before. 
“We’re getting a lot of at-
tention; the school is getting 
widely popular,” Pulawski 
continued. “Non-theatre peo-
ple are starting to recognize 
the name as a place for musical 
theatre, sort of like Juilliard.”
“I had an acting teacher 
who inspired me to audition 
for this school,” Pulawski said 
when asked if there were any 
past teachers she would nomi-
nate. “We all had mentors.”
Alex Wanebo, a ?rst-year 
acting major, said she also was 
glad that the award has open 
nominations for educators. “I 
had a couple [teachers] who 
really in?uenced me; I’d love 
to get them recognized for 
their work.”

Former Chairman and 
Chief Executive Of?cer 
(CEO) of PNC Financial Ser-
vices Group James Rohr has 
been elected chairman of 
Carnegie Mellon’s board of 
trustees, according to a uni-
versity press release.
Rohr joined the board in 
1992. Among his contribu-
tions to the board, he has 
been vice chairman since 
2012, currently chairs the 
board’s nominating and 
governance committee, and 
serves on the ?nance com-
mittee. He was the ?nance 
committee’s vice chair from 
2007–12 and chaired the 
search committee that ulti-
mately selected Subra Suresh 
as Carnegie Mellon’s current 
president.
Rohr also helped establish 
the university’s PNC Center 
for Financial Services Innova-
tion within the Tepper School 
of Business, as well as a PNC 
Professorship in Finance, 
according to the university 
news release.
Rohr became PNC’s CEO 
in 2000 and retired last year.
Rohr will take the place of 
Raymond Lane, who became 
chairman in 2009, and is a 
life trustee of the university. 
Lane, partner emeritus at 
Menlo Park, Calif.-based ven-
ture capital ?rm Kleiner Per-
kins Cau?eld & Byers, will re-
main a member of the board 
and will continue to serve on 
its executive committee, ac-
cording to the release.
“As one of America’s most 
successful business lead-
ers, Jim Rohr has provided 
insightful guidance and ser-
vice to Carnegie Mellon as a 
member of the board of trust-
ees for 22 years,” President 
Suresh said in the release.
About Lane, President 
Suresh said, “Ray Lane has 
been an outstanding and 
inspiring chairman of the 
board, guiding it effectively 
during a period of transition 
at the university.”
New board of trustees chair former PNC CEO
Shirley, Neville now graduate student housing
As part of a number of 
changes to this year’s hous-
ing selection process, Shir-
ley and Neville apartments 
will no longer be available 
as options for undergradu-
ate students for the 2015-16 
academic year. Instead, the 
on-campus locations will be 
open for graduate students.
The choice to offer these 
locations to graduate stu-
dents is part of “an effort to 
create a more concentrated 
living experience for gradu-
ate students,” according to 
Housing Services’s “What’s 
New for Room Selection 
2015” webpage.
The website speci?es that 
graduate students will apply 
for these spaces in an ap-
plication separate from the 
normal room selection pro-
cess, with more information 
about the application com-
ing soon.
Students living in Shirley 
and Neville Apartments this 
year are eligible to participate 
in other phases of the selec-
tion process, but cannot retain 
their current apartments.
In addition to this 
change, the housing selec-
tion process has been moved 
forward dramatically. The 
housing portal, where stu-
dents can select their room 
assignments, will open on 
Feb. 15. Students looking 
to keep their current rooms 
must specify that they are 
retaining by Feb. 18, while 
students participating in 
general room selection must 
apply by Feb. 26.
Students living in Greek 
houses this year will now 
also be able to participate in 
room selection, where previ-
ously they could not move 
back on campus.

Mellon’s room selection pro-
cess and information about 
the university’s housing op-
tions, look for The Tartan’s

At the beginning of this 
semester, Carnegie Mellon of-
?cially switched the company 
providing cleaning services 
for its buildings. Cleaning ser-
vices had been provided by 
Integrated Service Solutions, 
Inc. (ISS) since 1996, and are 
now being provided under a 
contract with Philadelphia-
based Aramark. Aramark has a 
janitorial service division that 
provides cleaning for numer-
ous locations ranging from 
of?ce buildings to hospitals, 
in addition to other academic 
institutions.
Marcia Gerwig, director of 
the Jared L. Cohon University 
Center, described the decision 
process saying that “there was 
a bidding process and a com-
mittee” which included faculty 
and staff. “There were around 
six companies which sent pro-
posals, and three gave presen-
tations,” Gerwig continued, 
saying that the committee 
“had a lot of input from a lot 
of folks on campus” and gave 
a recommendation, but ul-
timately the ?nal decision 
rested with Carnegie Mellon’s 
Facilities Management Servic-
es, who formally hold the con-
tract. Gerwig noted that the 
?nal decision was not made 
based on the bid price alone, 
instead being evaluated on a 
number of different factors, 
which she did not specify.
The bidding process start-
ed during the summer of 2014 
and the transition began in 
early December, with Aramark 
of?cially taking over on Jan. 1. 
The bidding process took place 
last year because the univer-
sity’s contract with ISS was 
expiring, with ISS re-bidding, 
but not being re-awarded the 
contract.
Directing of Housing 
Services Thomas Cooley ex-
plained that the new provider 
is operating under the name 
“Custodial Services,” and de-
scribed that along with this 
transition the university is 
striving to meet newer, higher 
cleaning standards.
“One huge change that 
housing made is the way that 
the contract is evaluated,” 
Cooley explained, noting there 
would be “quality evaluations 
periodically throughout the 
year” by an independent evalu-
ator. Cooley also spoke of a 
“more detailed process” which 
has been developed for the uni-
versity’s residential buildings 
regarding what items should 
be cleaned after students leave 
the building at the end of an 
academic year.
In terms of staff which had 
been previously hired under 
ISS, employees were rein-
terviewed by Aramark, who, 
Gerwig reports, had to keep 
around 60 percent of union 
personnel. “I think almost all 
of them stayed. I think there 
might have been some who 
were not rehired; some chose 
not to be rehired. So, for the 
most part, they stayed.”
One Carnegie Mellon 
cleaning services worker, who 
chose to remain anonymous, 
explained that there was un-
certainty regarding this transi-
tion process and the status of 
their employment when this 
transition was announced. 
This source also stated that 
during the interviewing pro-
cess, workers hired under ISS 
were put on a 60-day proba-
tionary period and were sub-
ject to background checks, 
as well as drug and alcohol 
screenings. 
Gerwig reported that 
these checks are a common 
process used during rehiring 
scenarios.
Gerwig spoke to the tran-
sition, remarking that “it was 
kind of a rough start in Janu-
ary,” something she attributed 
to Aramark taking over dur-
ing a period when there were 
no students on campus. “Even 
though the personnel stayed 
the same, it was hard for the 
supervisors to visualize what it 
looks like with students here.”
As to the causes of these 
dif?culties, Gerwig explained 
that “even though the staff has 
been here, they were moved 
around a little bit, and it’s a 
different supervisor and dif-
ferent equipment,” on which 
staff need to be retrained.
Cooley estimated that 
there would be “about 90 
days before we transition 
completely,” because the staff 
is undergoing training on 
the new practices and equip-
ment, in addition to providing 
cleaning services. He summa-
rized the effort by saying that 
we should expect “cleaning 
more often and to a higher 
standard.”
“Aramark has cleaning ac-
counts at other campuses, but 
we have a very unique envi-
ronment. It’s been a learning 
curve,” Gerwig concluded.
January 26, 2015 « The Tartan thetartan.org/news » A3
lower 2.99 percent increase. 
Similarly tiered increases of 
about 4 percent for ?rst-years 
and 3 percent for upperclass-
men were also implemented 
for 2011-12 and 2012-13.
Costs are largely set by de-
partments, such as Housing 
and Dining Services for meal 
plans and room and board, 
who analyze their ?nan-
cial needs and submit their 
proposed costs to Murphy. 
Murphy then discusses the 
proposed rates before they 
are presented to the board of 
trustees. These proposed rates 
should remain within an in-
?ationary range of around 3 
to 3.5 percent for non-tiered 
years, according to Murphy.
“What we thought with 
the 3.3 percent [tuition in-
crease] ... was that it’s aggres-
sive relative to our history, but 
consistent with many things 
that we’re doing,” Murphy 
said, mentioning the Jared L. 
Cohon University Center and 
other initiatives to enhance 
students’ experiences as ex-
amples of improvements these 
costs help to fund.
According to U.S. News & 
World Report, Carnegie Mel-
lon ranked number ?ve for 
most expensive private col-
leges and universities with a 
listed 2014-15 tuition and fees 
cost of $48,786 on the list. The 
university came behind Co-
lumbia University, Sarah Law-
rence College, Vassar College, 
and Trinity College in that or-
der. Columbia ranked highest 
on the list with a tuition and 
fees cost of $51,008.
“We need to look at a much 
larger picture here,” said 
?rst-year economics major 
Yash Maheshwari via email. 
Maheshwari is a member of 
Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of 
MoneyThink, a nationwide 
organization aimed at teach-
ing ?nancial literacy to high 
school students. “The tuition 
is not an expense but an in-
vestment for the next 60 years 
of our lives. What seems like a 
considerable increase today, 
may lead to improved gains in 
the long run.”
Speaking about rising tu-
ition nationwide, Murphy 
said, “The real question is 
‘What is the value that you re-
turn to students?’ And it’s both 
an economic value and a non-
economic value, and I think as 
a nation it’s important that we 
recognize both.”
“On the other hand, I 
wouldn’t want us to get com-
placent about [rising costs],” 
Murphy continued. “And so 
we need to make sure that 
we’re cutting costs where we 
can cut costs, investing where 
we need to invest, and mak-
ing sure that students have the 
supports that they need.”

Two-player limit Texas hold’em poker solved
BROOKE KUEI
Contributing Editor
There’s a new player in 
the world of poker, and he 
doesn’t wear a baseball cap or 
sunglasses. This new player is 
Cepheus, a computer program 
developed by Carnegie Mellon 
University School of Comput-
er Science alumnus Michael 
Bowling. According to a pa-
per published in the Jan. 9 
issue of Science, Cepheus has 
essentially solved heads-up 
limit Texas hold’em.
This version of poker is a 
two-player game in which all 
bets are a ?xe*d size, creating 
a game which is made up of 
approximately 1014 decision 
points — unique possible posi-
tions a player can ?nd himself 
in where he is forced to make 
an action — as opposed to the 
10161 decision points more 
complicated versions of the 
game entail. “It’s the smallest 
game that humans play in 
poker,” Bowling explained. 
“But it’s also the ?rst imper-
fect information game [com-
petitively played by humans] 
to be solved.”
Imperfect information 
games, as the name suggests, 
are those in which the entire 
state of the game is not known 
to a player when he makes a 
decision. While large games 
such as checkers have already 
been solved, the perfect in-
formation nature of checkers 
makes it much easier to solve 
than games like poker.
In order to solve heads-up 
limit Texas hold’em, Bowl-
ing’s group started Cepheus 
off by having it play against 
itself randomly. After each 
play, it computed how much 
money it could have made if 
it had played differently; in 
other words, it calculated its 
“regret” at each decision point 
and then updated its strategy 
accordingly, getting smarter 
and smarter with each cycle. 
This method is called counter-
factual regret minimization. 
“If you do that strategy update 
in a particular mathematical 
way, you can prove that its

“Being recognized as an 
IEEE Fellow is a wonderful 
con?rmation of the contri-
butions that my research 
brought to the ?eld of en-
ergy aware and sustainable 
computing. It truly feels 
great to be ‘part of the club,’ 
the most selective group of 
scientists and engineers in 
the electrical and electron-
ics engineering domain,” 
Marculescu said.
Marculescu’s research 
regarding energy-aware 
computing and computer-
aided design for non-silicon 
applications aims to achieve 
sustainable computing, and 
the use of that computing 
to achieve sustainability 
in renewable energy and 
distribution. 
Her current project, 
funded by the National 
Science Foundation, is the 
implementation of an ener-
gy-aware computing system 
to explore the use of a ray 
approach for hydropower. 
They hope to have results in 
the next three to ?ve years.

Charlie Hebdo sparks freedom of speech debate
KATHRYN MCKEOUGH
Staffwriter
In the wake of the Charlie 
Hebdo executions in Paris, 
David Cameron, Prime Min-
ister of the United Kingdom, 
announced his intent to crimi-
nalize encrypted messages 
sent over the Internet that 
could not be broken by the 
government. Cameron’s solu-
tion seems drastic to many in-
ternet users, but he sees it as 
an act of terrorism prevention. 
Cameron’s actions prompted 
Pugwash members to ques-
tion their views on freedom 
of speech and the complicated 
balance between privacy and 
protection.
First, Pugwash discussed 
the importance of free speech. 
Freedom of speech allows 
people to express their opin-
ions without being persecut-
ed for their beliefs. It forces 
government, companies, and 
other groups of people to re-
?ect on their actions. Pugwash 
concluded that even though 
freedom of speech is harmful 
to certain people, the bene?ts 
of people voicing their opinion 
are far more important.
Each government is re-
sponsible for maintaining the 
balance between invading pri-
vacy and and protecting its cit-
izens. Most people in Pugwash 
felt like there should be some 
way to communicate privately 
without someone watching. If 
we allow the government ac-
cess to every medium of com-
munication, then we have giv-
en them absolute power over 
what we say. Others argued 
that the prevention of terror-
ist attacks is worth giving up 
our privacy. Are we willing to 
let people, like the journalists 
of Charlie Hebdo, die just so 
we can express our thoughts 
in private?
Next, we explored how 
reading encrypted emails and 
messages compares to surveil-
lance in other forms of com-
munication. Where do we 
draw the line about what we 
allow government to hear? 
One member compared hav-
ing access to all online com-
munication as being able to 
SCITECH BRIEFS
High speed cameras capture the scent of rain
Scientists at the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technology 
believe that they have discov-
ered the process that leads 
to the earthy smell during 
a rainfall. Using high-speed 
cameras, the researchers were 
able to study the mechanism 
of raindrops as they land on a 
variety of surfaces, including 
soil. 
Imaging technology re-
vealed that a droplet ?attens 
after it lands on a surface. Si-
multaneously, small bubbles 
emerge from the droplet, 
which causes the dispersal of 
hundreds of aerosol droplets. 
In turn, surface materials pres-
ent in the rain droplet become 
distributed within the sur-
rounding environment, which 
may provide the aromatic ele-
ments of fallen rain. 
The study, which was pub-
lished in Nature Communica-
tions, may explain how certain 
ground microbes and chemi-
cals may have come into con-
tact with humans.

NASA explores the dwarf planets Ceres and Pluto
The study of dwarf planets 
may hold well-preserved clues 
in learning about the forma-
tion of the solar system. Dur-
ing the coming March, the 
Dawn spacecraft will go into 
orbit around the dwarf planet 
Ceres, located in the main as-
teroid belt between Mars and 
Jupiter. The spacecraft will 
also brie?y visit Pluto.
A construction of the Na-
tional Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the Dawn 
spacecraft is expected to be 
near enough to Ceres to pro-
duce images of the tiny dwarf 
planet, which is about a third 
of the size of Earth’s moon. 
Discovered in 1801, Ceres is 
distinguished for containing 
an unusually large amount of 
water, which is not found in 
any of its neighbors. Scientists 
also suspect that Ceres and 
former planet, Pluto — now 
separated by billions of miles 
— used to both exist in the 
icy Kuiper Belt, where Pluto is 
currently located.

New technique to contain genetically modi?ed organisms
Two groups of scientists 
from U.S. research universi-
ties have developed a complex 
method to ensure the preven-
tion of potential disease and 
ecological destruction caused 
by the escape of genetically 
modi?ed organisms. 
The researchers modi?ed 
the DNA of E. coli, a species 
of bacteria, by replacing an 
amino acid that halts protein 
construction with a synthetic 
amino acid. By interfering 
with the building blocks of 
DNA, researchers were able to 
cause the bacteria to depend 
on the synthetic amino acid 
for survival, even in the event 
that the bacterial DNA devel-
ops a single mutation. 
Despite doubts about the 
need for new methods to 
contain these particular ge-
netically manipulated cells, 
the technique promises many 
bene?ts, including defense 
against problematic viruses 
that ruin the production of 
goods made with bacteria.

Invertebrates found living deep beneath Antarctic Ice
Earlier this month, re-
searchers from Whillans 
Ice Stream Subglacial Ac-
cess Research Drilling (WIS-
SARD) used a hot water drill 
to cut through half a mile of 
ice in west Antarctica. With 
submersible cameras, the 
National Science Foundation-
sponsored team uncovered 
?sh and other invertebrates 
inhabiting the dark depths 
of the Ross Sea, which has a 
temperature of negative two 
degrees Celsius. 
This is the ?rst time marine 
life has been found this close 
to the South Pole. It is also the 
?rst time the “grounding zone” 
— the intersection of Antarc-
tic ice, land and sea — has 
been reached and sampled. 
Researchers can learn more 
about the ice sheets and their 
possible effects on sea rise by 
examining sediment from the 
zone. In addition, researchers 
hope to learn how the discov-
ered sea creatures can survive 
in such an environment.

Psychologists suggest that seeing is not remembering
Two psychologists at Penn 
State University found that 
memories must be consciously 
activated in order for someone 
to remember even the basic 
details of an experience. 
In a study of 100 under-
graduate students, volunteers 
viewed a simple arrangement 
of elements, which included 
numbers, letters, or colors. 
They were then asked to recall 
the location of a particular el-
ement. While the participants 
successfully performed the 
?rst task several times, they 
failed when they were given 
a surprise question, which 
required identi?cation of the 
particular element that was 
previously located. 
Known as “attribute amne-
sia,” the phenomenon occurs 
when a person uses a piece of 
information to execute a task, 
but then forgets what that in-
formation was at least a sec-
ond later. The phenomenon 
suggests the selective nature 
of the human memory.

Swiss pilots plan to launch solar-powered plane
Plans for the launch of the 
solar-powered plane, Solar 
Impulse 2, have recently been 
released to the public. By early 
March, Swiss pilots plan to ?y 
the Solar Impulse 2 around 
the globe, leaving from Abu 
Dhabi and crossing the Paci?c 
Ocean as well as the United 
States. At night, energy ef?-
cient batteries and motors will 
help keep the plane powered. 
While it is the size of a Boe-
ing 747, the Solar Impulse 2 
will only weigh as much as a 
family car, as it is composed 
of lightweight carbon ?bers. 
The cockpit contains thin and 
highly effective insulation 
foam which has already been 
adapted in household kitch-
ens. Members of the ambitious 
project hope to promote the 
usage of solar energy through 
live broadcasts throughout the 
?ight, as well as through talks 
to schools, politicians and the 
media.

regret has to go to zero over 
time…and that means its strat-
egy is approaching a perfect 
strategy,” Bowling said.
Bowling’s group ran Ce-
pheus for two months, during 
which time they had 48 hun-
dred central processing units 
(CPUs) working on the strat-
egy, with each CPU processing 
about 6 billion poker hands ev-
ery second. By the end of this 
time, the strategy was statisti-
cally indistinguishable from a 
perfect strategy.
So what can we do with an 
undefeatable poker genius? 
Tuomas Sandholm, professor 
of computer science at Carn-
egie Mellon University and a 
member of Bowling’s Ph.D. 
committee while he was a 
graduate student, explained 
that poker is not just a game. 
“Poker is a benchmark… which 
we can use to measure progress 
in the ?eld of solving imperfect 
information games. And the 
real applications that we’re tar-
geting are things like security 
applications, cybersecurity, 
auctions, negotiations, medi-
cal applications, and so forth.” 
In fact, the Association for the 
Advancement of Arti?cial In-
telligence (AAAI) has been 
holding annual poker com-
petitions since 2006, where 
researchers from around the 
world compete with each other 
in various forms of poker and 
discuss their algorithms.
In the ?eld of cybersecurity, 
Sandholm explained how im-
perfect information algorithms 
can be useful in wireless jam-
ming, when a communicator 
needs to decide when to com-
municate and with what power 
level, and a jammer needs to 
decide when to jam and with 
what power level. He and his 
collaborators have published 
on this topic.
These algorithms also have 
various different medical ap-
plications. “One is on the pop-
ulation level,” Sandholm said. 
“So think about a pandemic 
coming through and you have 
to decide what segments of the 
population, de?ned by geogra-
phy or some other aspect of the 
people, you should vaccinate 
or quarantine, and when to do 
it.”
 This type of strategy can 
also be used for sequential 
treatment plans, such as for 
patients of HIV.
A third medical application 
is in drug design. “A problem 
in drug design is that the dis-
ease that the drug is intended 
to battle will also adapt to de-
velop a resistance to the drug. 
So here the idea is that we can 
have models of the disease re-
sponse and then we can actu-
ally bundle into the drug some-
thing that will already hit the 
evolved version,” Sandholm 
said.
There is still a lot of prog-
ress to be made in the ?eld of 
imperfect information games, 
such as developing arti?cial 
intelligence that can ef?ciently 
play poker with more than just 
two players or with no-limit 
bets. 
While it will be very dif?-
cult to completely solve poker, 
computer scientists are getting 
closer to solving other versions 
of the game. “I think we’re not 
far off,” Bowling said. “I think 
as a community we’re a few 
years away from being able to 
exceed the best in the world 
at heads-up no limit Texas 
hold’em.”
Sandholm and his students 
currently have the best pro-
gram for this harder form of 
poker and won the Annual 
Computer Poker Competition 
in 2014.
Understanding the universe with The Theory of Everything
SHAOJIE BAI
Staffwriter
Everything, in just one 
theory?
Four kinds of forces have 
dominated this universe 
since its birth 1.4 billion 
years ago. Gravitational 
force, which causes an apple 
to fall; electromagnetic (EM) 
force, which manifests as EM 
fields and light; and strong 
and weak nuclear forces, 
which are responsible for 
the atoms that make up all 
the elements we know. The 
combination of these forces, 
as a result, is the sole source 
of energy for this universe. 
From a photon knocking 
a metal sheet to a massive 
black hole collapsing time 
space, everything is formed, 
moved, and changed.
But is there a theory, or 
an equation — probably no 
longer than your finger — 
that incorporates the answer 
to everything? A mystery for 
thousands of years, this per-
plexing but tempting prob-
lem has inspired innumer-
able physicists to contribute 
their brilliant ideas.
The Theory of Everything 
(TOE), also named the ulti-
mate theory, is a long-sought 
hypothetical method that 
strives to link together all that 
we know and observe about 
this universe. While this may 
seem to be a crazy idea, it 
has been a long process of 
exploration which originates 
even back to Dem-
ocritus’ time. Our 
ancestors initially 
tried to come up with 
the notion of “atoms,” 
but not those in Dalton’s 
version. People like Dem-
ocritus believed everything 
was due to the mechanical 
collision between these mi-
croscopic “atoms,” which 
they never found. But now 
we know, thanks to Sir Isaac 
Newton, no contact is even 
needed given the law of 
universal gravitation.
In modern age, two 
famous theories have 
been closer to a TOE 
than ever: General 
Relativity (GR) and 
Quantum Field Theory 
(QFT). Albert Einstein, 
who initially coined the term 
“unified field theory” (an-
other name for TOE), made 
every effort trying to prove 
that electromagnetic field 
and gravity are nothing but 
two different manifestations 
of a more fundamental field. 
General Relativity gives 
people a brand new geomet-
ric way to envisage gravity. 
For instance, imagine plac-
ing a 20-kg lead ball on a soft 
mattress, which is then de-
formed because of the heavy 
weight of the lead ball. This 
is exactly what happened 
in time space (mattress), 
with the presence of colos-
sal celestial objects (lead 
ball). A remarkable theory, 
GR explains nature and in 
fact all its phenomena 
in a macroscopic level. 
However, the puzzle 
gets more interesting as 
Planck’s Quantum Theory 
enters, which perfectly re-
solves all the phenomenon 
taking place in microscopic 
particle-level physics.
Most of the people to-
day who have taken physics 
courses, even just at the in-
troductory level, have been 
taught to bow down to these 
two great 
pillars of modern physics. 
For anything that we can pos-
sibly imagine, and for prob-
ably every “how things work” 
question, one of relativity 
and quantum theory must 
be behind 
the scenes. 
Unfortunate-
ly, GR and 
QFT have been 
proven to be in-
compatible with each 
other. How to reconcile 
them in a better way 
and whether we will be 
forced to discard one 
and prefer another is 
not yet known.
There have also 
been other creative and 
promising theories.
First, String Theory 
describes a world in 
which point-like par-
ticles are really 
one-dimension-
al objects called 
“strings.” These 
strings are be-
lieved by some 
scientists to os-
cillate and dance 
in a way that gives particles 
important properties such as 
mass and charge.
Second, Casual Sets does 
not aim to be TOE directly, 
but its importance to QFT 
and the standard model of 
particle physics is considered 
to be a key for TOE. Its major 
principle is that space-time is 
not as continuous as we have 
imagined.
Meanwhile, there are also 
great mathematicians and 
physicists who do not sup-
port the existence of TOE at 
all. They cushion this reason-
able criticism with strong 
arguments. For example, no 
physics theory is believed to 
be completely accurate. In-
stead, theories have been de-
veloped as models of certain 
natural behaviors that can al-
ways be improved upon and 
adjusted (consider Newton’s 
law and relativity). 
Furthermore, Godel’s fa-
mous First Incompleteness 
Theorem states that an axi-
omatic system cannot be both 
consistent and complete.
Without a doubt, if TOE 
really exists, it will fail this 
test — its consistency guar-
antees that the “theory of 
everything” is at best a “the-
ory of something.” It will not 
be compatible with Godel’s 
theorem because TOE will 
be both complete and consis-
tent. Stephen Hawking is one 
supporter of this criticism.
The answer has, there-
fore, always been unknown. 
Despite devoting mountains 
of effort, still nobody can 
give a clear answer regarding 
the existence of TOE. What 
makes the search for TOE 
meaningful is more than just 
the fame it would bring. This 
thirst for TOE originates not 
only from a quest for a higher 
level of science, but also how 
human beings want to find a 
universal pattern governing 
our lives.
Who controls the four 
fundamental forces? What 
makes up the mind of God 
or the creator of everything? 
The key is in our hands.

Choset, a professor in the 
Robotics Institute, was cited 
as a Fellow for his contribu-
tions to the design and control 
of highly articulated robots.
Regarding this recogni-
tion, Choset noted the contri-
butions of his students. “I am 
incredibly grateful for all of 
the hard work and insight my 
students have put into mak-
ing snake robots in my lab,” 
Choset said. “These robots are 
able to thread through tightly 
packed spaces to access lo-
cations that people cannot. 
The challenges to build these 
robots draw from many disci-
plines, and without the multi-
disciplinary and hard-work-
ing nature of the Carnegie 
Mellon students, we would 
never have successfully built 
these robots and then de-
ployed them for applications 
including search and rescue, 
archeology, and minimally in-
vasive surgery.”
Choset directs the Bioro-
botics Laboratory, and spe-
cializes in snake-like robots 
that can easily maneuver 
through rubble and pipes of 
an archaeological site or a 
power plant. 
Choset co-authored a 
number of papers this past 
year, including one that ex-
amined the movements of 
actual sidewinder snakes in 
order to determine how his 
robotic snakes could move 
uphill.
In 2002, the MIT Technol-
ogy Review elected Choset 
as one of its top 100 innova-
tors in the world under 35. In 
2005, Choset was the lead au-
thor of a textbook published 
by MIT Press titled “Principles 
of Robot Motion.” Recently, 
Choset co-founded the com-
pany Medrobotics, which 
markets a surgical device with 
a snake-like design in Europe.
Waibel, professor of com-
puter science at Carnegie 
Mellon and the University of 
Karlsruhe in Germany, and 
associate director of the Lan-
guage Technologies Institute 
at Carnegie Mellon, was cited 
as a Fellow for his contribu-
tions to neural network-based 
speech recognition and trans-
lation, and his work with mul-
timodal interfaces.
Waibel directs the inter-
national center for Advanced 
Communication Technologies 
(interACT), a multi-university 
lab that develops software for 
speech-to-speech and human-
machine translation.
Waibel was one of the 
founders of C-STAR, the in-
ternational consortium for

POKER, From A4Freedom of speech and surveillance
hear every conversation we 
have with one another. An-
other suggested that it was 
almost as bad as reading 
one’s mind. The government 
already has access to phones 
through wire tap and can ac-
cess written documents using 
a warrant. We must decide 
how much free reign we are 
going to give the government 
over our thoughts, comments 
and communications.
Pugwash offered some 
solutions for compromise 
between privacy and protec-
tion. One person suggested 
a third party, like a telecom-
munication company, that 
would be able to access our 
encrypted emails. The gov-
ernment would then have to 
apply for a warrant to gain 
access to the information and 
could not simply immediately 
take it. It was also suggested 
that Cameron may be ?x-
ated on the wrong issue. In-
stead of limiting free speech, 
the government should be 
focused on protecting free 
speech, which could be more 
directly done by protecting 
controversial journalists and 
peaceful protesters.
Overall, we agreed that 
David Cameron’s actions 
against encrypted online 
messages are a little extreme. 
However, the Charlie Hebdo 
incident has brought to light 
?aws in our treatment of 
free speech. The next step is 
to ?nd a way to protect law-
abiding citizens without op-
pressing them.
Student Pugwash is a non-

zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
summarizes their discussion 
on free speech.

An article released this week in 
The New York Times ?oats the pos-
sibility that if sororities allowed al-
cohol into their houses, there may 
be a decrease in the occurrence of 
sexual assault on campuses across 
the nation.
A study funded by the U.S. De-
partment of Justice concluded 
that 25 percent of alcohol or drug-
enabled sexual assaults are perpe-
trated by fraternity members, and 
attending a fraternity party makes 
women 1.4 times more likely to be 
sexually assaulted. The argument in 
favor of allowing sororities to serve 
alcohol is that changing the venue 
changes the control.
When women attend parties with 
alcohol at fraternity houses, the men 
are in control. They dictate the guest 
list, the drinks, and the exits. The 
party scene of Greek life is entirely 
dependent on the 
fraternities and 
the choices they 
make, which 
leaves women 
more vulner-
able to sexual 
assault.
By giving 
women in so-
rorities the priv-
ilege of hosting 
parties with al-
cohol, they gain the 
ability to control their environment. 
There is also the added advantage 
that when women are in charge, they 
are less vulnerable and more likely 
to be proactive about sexual assault. 
If something suspicious appears to 
be happening, sorority sisters could 
look out for one another and police 
the situation more effectively than 
frat brothers might be able to on 
their own turf. While this will not 
eliminate sexual assault entirely, it 
gives more agency to the women, 
de?nitely decreasing the risk.
Yet sororities have a very long 
tradition of abstaining from alco-
hol use in the house. This is a policy 
dictated by the National Panhellenic 
Conference, which serves as the 
governing body for all 26 of 
the sororities it 
recognizes 
nationwide. 
Even though sororities bene?t 
from the policy in terms of lifestyle 
and health, its historical motivations 
are more ?nancial. The New York 
Times article cites that while the 
average sorority member only costs 
about $25-50 per year to insure, 
each fraternity member costs around 
$160 per year due to alcohol-related 
incidents.
While it is understandable that 
cost is a consideration, there are cer-
tainly other factors that should play 
a hand in the decision. A spokes-
person for the National Panhellenic 
Conference (NPC) said that, despite 
the bene?ts, she found it unlikely 
that the policy would “[change] 
anywhere in the near future.” By re-
fusing to consider the change, the 
NPC is favoring ?nancial 
practicality over the 
possible bene?ts that 
may result. The is-
sue deserves to be 
considered, as the 
sexual welfare and 
safety of members 
in the long-term 
should be more 
important than 
the resources that 
the research and 
insurance may 
cost them.
This plan does, 
however, place the 
onus on the victims 
to protect them-
selves. A more effec-
tive plan would be 
geared toward the 
perpetrators. Fra-
ternities need to be 
responsible for pro-
gramming that educates members 
on safe behaviors and then institut-
ing policies that ensure that they 
are acting appropriately in high risk 
situations. On top of that, universi-
ties also need to take reported cases 
more seriously so that all perpetra-
tors of sexual assault will face the 
consequences of their actions.

Obama’s college plan should set example for CMU
U.S. still has much to learn from celebrating MLK
Predictably, Carnegie Mellon is 
raising its tuition. In an email sent 
to the campus community on Jan. 
14, Vice President for Campus Af-
fairs Michael Murphy announced 
that students entering college in the 
next academic year will pay a total of 
about $63,240, an increase of 3.38 
percent from the previous year.
At last year’s rates, Carnegie Mel-
lon ranked ?fth most expensive pri-
vate university in the United States, 
behind only Columbia University, 
Sarah Lawrence College, Vassar Col-
lege, and Trinity College, according 
to USA Today. Though these other 
schools will likely also experience 
tuition increases, our new tuition 
raises us to third place by last year’s 
rates. That’s not a bronze medal to be 
proud of. 
While a leveling off of costs, let 
alone a decrease, is undoubtedly too 
much to ask, The Tartan asks Carn-
egie Mellon to be more transparent 
about the reasoning behind these 
costs. What is our tuition money go-
ing toward exactly, and why must 
costs be so high?
Carnegie Mellon is increasingly 
expensive at a time when the gov-
ernment ?nally seems to be taking 
strides to make higher education af-
fordable. President Barack Obama 
has proposed a plan that would pro-
vide all American students two free 
years of community college, given 
they maintain a 2.5 GPA and dem-
onstrate steady progress toward an 
associates degree or a transfer to a 
four-year university. The federal gov-
ernment would pick up 75 percent 
of the costs, with states covering the 
rest.
Obama’s community college ini-
tiative is revolutionary and long 
overdue. The initial public reaction 
to its unveiling has been overwhelm-
ingly positive, and it seems the only 
thing that might stop it from happen-
ing is opposition from the Republi-
can Congress. America is desperately 
in need of education reform, and the 
President’s plan would drastically 
improve the lives of millions of stu-
dents and increase education oppor-
tunities across the nation.
As Obama outlined in his State 
of the Union address Tuesday, col-
lege should be “as free and universal 
in America as high school is today.” 
The Tartan hopes that this will be 
the ?rst step toward more affordable 
college education in general. Private, 
far-from-free universities such as 
Carnegie Mellon should take a page 
from President Obama’s book, and 
keep his plan in mind when the time 
comes to discuss next year’s tuition.
This year, Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents enjoyed a three-day weekend 
for Martin Luther King, Jr. Day for 
the ?rst time in recent years.
In August, President Suresh 
emailed students to inform them of 
the change, saying: “I have decided 
to declare MLK Day a university holi-
day. This will allow us to honor Dr. 
King, while extending and enriching 
the excellent service and community 
engagement programs that re?ect 
our commitment to Dr. King’s dream 
throughout the month of January.” 
The holiday included a wide variety 
of diversity based programming, and 
The Tartan was excited by many of 
the events that were offered, espe-
cially the Colors@CMU celebration.
The campus participation was 
heartening, and indicates that on 
CMU’s campus, many students are 
accepting of differences and able to 
have a healthy, open dialogue re-
garding these issues. The adminis-
tration’s decision to make this “day 
off” mean something strengthens 
this campus’s commitment to diver-
sity and is an indicator of the strides 
that society is making.
However, it is important to re-
member that this attitude is not in-
dicative of society as a whole. In the 
Pittsburgh community, reactions to 
celebrations and protests were less 
than warm. 
For example, when protests 
blocked streets in Oakland last Mon-
day, students took to the popular 
anonymous social media app Yik Yak 
to express their frustrations, linking 
the inconvenience of the protests to 
their apparent lack of interest in civil 
rights issues. Many postings were, 
intentionally or not, offensive and 
upsetting, highlighting the igno-
rance, hate, and casual racism still 
present in our community.
As members of an in?uential col-
lege community, we need to con-
tinue promoting the acceptance of 
diversity and the celebration of civil 
rights. 
Our attitudes can in?uence the 
attitudes of others, and we can cata-
lyze real change in the greater Pitts-
burgh community. Remembering 
heroes who fought for equality and 
participating in carefully designed 
programming are strong ?rst steps, 
but we must remember to keep our 
convictions throughout the year as 
well.
Charlie Hebdo never asked for glori?cation
ABHISHEK TAYAL
Junior Staffwriter
On Jan. 7 at about 11:30 a.m., 
France faced its largest national se-
curity threat in decades. Two violent 
extremists broke into the of?ces of 
the satirical weekly Charlie Hebdo 
and opened ?re on unarmed civil-
ians. amidst proclamations of “Al-
lahu akbar,” they rained approxi-
mately 50 shots of gun?re onto the 
magazine’s staff, killing eleven and 
injuring seven others. The attack 
was apparently motivated by “blas-
phemous” images of the Prophet 
Muhammad that Charlie Hebdo rou-
tinely published.
In the following weeks, support 
and solidarity for Charlie Hebdo and 
France poured in from all quarters. 
Within days, #JeSuisCharlie was 
retweeted over 5 million times. Vig-
ils and marches were held in cities 
all around the world, from London 
and Amsterdam to Melbourne and 
Perth. A massive unity rally, at-
tended by approximately 3.7 million 
people throughout France — includ-
ing 40 world leaders — was cen-
tered in Paris on Jan. 11. Further-
more, the post-attack “Survivors’ 
Issue” of Charlie Hebdo was bought 
by nearly 7 million people who 
wanted to express their support for 
the magazine.
Let me be absolutely clear: com-
plete freedom of speech is one of 
modern society’s greatest achieve-
ments, and using violence to sup-
press this freedom in the name of 
God is unjusti?ably, unforgivably 
evil. Sti?ing controversial ideas 
through force is a highly condem-
nable act that is rightly illegal. That 
said, the glori?cation of Charlie 
Hebdo and its positions, as demon-
strated by the outpour of support 
for the magazine over the past few 
weeks, sets a dangerous precedent 
and tends to miss the very point that 
Charlie Hebdo has tried to make.
Going through Charlie Hebdo’s 
previous issues, one discovers the 
magazine’s penchant for taking bru-
tally crude aim at all kinds of ?gures 
that societies around the world re-
vere. From religious prophets such as 
Jesus and Muhammad, to important 
?gures today such as the Pope and 
the President of the United States, 
Charlie Hebdo has been equally of-
fensive to all. It has reveled in its 
ability to upset and affront, and gen-
erally be a shameless irritant to un-
imaginative, uptight, mainstream 
society. This brand of humor, col-
loquially known as “gouaille” in 
France, does not attempt to align 
itself with any one particular school 
of thought. Instead, it attacks any-
one and anything that attempts to 
position itself as an exclusive pur-
veyor of the truth.
The veneration of Charlie Hebdo 
in western media over the past few 
weeks is the very sort of phenome-
non that Charlie Hebdo would mock. 
The massive marches, the hashtag, 
and the sales of Charlie Hebdo’s lat-
est issue are cruelly ironic, in that 
they ?y in the face of the very anti-
establishment sentiment that has 
traditionally been Charlie Hebdo’s 
lifeblood. Memorializing the mur-
dered staff of Charlie Hebdo as mar-
tyrs of free speech is to turn them 
into the very kinds of icons that they 
routinely ridiculed.
Another reason not to glorify 
Charlie Hebdo is somewhat more de-
pressing and far more practical. One 
cannot escape the fact that several 
of their issues are deeply offensive to 
massive swathes of people, particu-
larly Muslims, to whom any image of 
Muhammad — let alone a blatantly 
offensive depiction — is sacrile-
gious. Some of their covers include a 
bare-naked Prophet Muhammad ly-
ing prostrate and Muhammad being 
beheaded by an ISIS ?ghter.
If such material resulted in a vio-
lent attack when their circulation 
was in the thousands, consider what 
might result now that their circula-
tion is in the millions. Giving such 
material widespread circulation is 
akin to providing ammunition to Al 
Qaeda and other peddlers of propa-
ganda and extremism. 
Although an overwhelming ma-
jority of the world’s Islamic popula-
tion is moderate and peace loving, 
Charlie Hebdo’s material, far more 
than ever before, is angering those 
on the fringes of the moderates and 
pushing them towards extremism. 
On the other side of the fence, in the 
political climate left by the wake of 
the attacks, Charlie Hebdo’s material 
is unwittingly promoting Islamo-
phobia within Western Europe and 
beyond.
According to Radio French In-
ternationale, more anti-Muslim in-
cidents have taken place in France 
since the Charlie Hebdo attacks than 
in all of 2014. In the meanwhile, fol-
lowing the publication of the “Sur-
vivors’ Issue,” South Asia and the 
Middle East have been swept by pro-
tests against Charlie Hebdo and its 
depictions of the Prophet, according 
to Yahoo News. In a sense, the glori-
?cation of Charlie Hebdo has pushed 
both sides further away from each 
other than ever before.
Traditionally, Charlie Hebdo’s 
brand of offensive humor has raised 
questions about our icons that de-
serve to be raised. With the atten-
tion Charlie Hebdo has gotten since 
the attacks, its societal role has un-
dergone deep change. Pre-venera-
tion Charlie Hebdo was a subcultural 
symbol of rebellion and impropri-
ety. Post-veneration Charlie Hebdo 
strikes more hatred into the world 
than curiosity.

A PERSON’S OPINION
Compiled by Justin McGown
January 26, 2015 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
LETTER TO THE EDITOR
When I think about my time at 
Carnegie Mellon, I think about a 
whirlwind of incredible experiences: 
Greek Sing, Spring Carnival, and 
late nights at Razzy. But I also think 
about that gnawing question that al-
ways lurked: What in the world am I 
going to do after I leave here?
Although this question is the 
quickest way to get any senior’s heart 
pounding and palms sweating, I ac-
tually have several ways I could an-
swer it. I could look for a consulting 
job in New York, apply to law school, 
or take some time off backpacking 
through Europe. I have choices. But 
the question of what I could do af-
ter graduation actually has a second 
part — what should I do? As I turned 
each choice over in my head, none of 
them felt quite right.
I grew up in Ann Arbor, Michigan, 
a place where Ph.D.’s are easier to 
?nd than McDonald’s. With both of 
my parents working as educators for 
the University of Michigan, educa-
tion had always been a top priority 
for my family. As a kid, I didn’t rec-
ognize just how privileged this made 
me. Yes, I worked hard to get to and 
through college and I faced struggles 
along the way. But I went to a high 
school where kids were expected to 
graduate and we had plenty of ex-
tra support and resources to help us 
plan our next chapters. Whenever I 
needed support, I never had to look 
far.
On top of all this, it wasn’t just my 
family and teachers that encouraged 
me. Examples of successful people 
who look like me were all around, 
from the people I saw on campus 
during college visits to the majority 
of government leaders and actors I 
watch on TV. Everywhere I turned, 
society told me I could be whatever 
I chose.
Meanwhile, too many kids lack 
the opportunity to imagine a ful?ll-
ing future for themselves. For stu-
dents growing up in our lowest-in-
come communities, just six percent 
will graduate from college by the 
time they’re 25. 
This statistic in no way re?ects 
kids’ capabilities — it’s a result of 
deeply entrenched systems of op-
pression that have denied low-in-
come kids equal access to opportuni-
ty for decades. I know that I can use 
my experiences to help kids battling 
these odds imagine an ambitious fu-
ture they de?ne for themselves, and 
make that future a reality. More im-
portantly, I believe I should.
I applied to Teach For America be-
cause I believe that privilege is a re-
sponsibility. I didn’t ask for this privi-
lege any more than Madison, a little 
girl I encountered during my intern-
ship in the juvenile court, asked to 
bounce around foster homes. When I 
think about what I can and should do 
with my privilege, working to be part 
of creating a more equitable system 
for kids like Madison is the answer 
that ?ts.
I know this work will be incred-
ibly challenging and humbling, and I 
will have to push myself harder than 
I ever have to give my students the 
education they deserve. I will need 
to work in close partnership with the 
parents, teachers, and community 
members who have been working to-
wards justice and equity long before 
I arrived. 
But I don’t want a job that lets 
me turn a blind eye to the injustice 
kids face every day. I want one that 
holds me accountable for the injus-
tices that plague our communities 
— because, although I did not create 
them, I’d still bear responsibility if I 
chose not to address them.
As I become a Teach For America 
corps member after graduation, I’ll 
be joining a network of more than 
47,000 people working relentlessly 
to make access to opportunity eq-
uitable. Teach For America is a net-
work of leaders, vastly diverse in 
background and experience, work-
ing across sectors to create change. 
We are all united around the fun-
damental belief that a quality educa-
tion is not a privilege — it is a right. 
We can ?ght to ensure all students 
get to enjoy that right. 
As you think about what in the 
world you’re going to do after you 
leave Carnegie Mellon, I hope you’ll 
join us.

A second Town Meeting for the 
entire university community on 
Carnegie Mellon’s 2015 strategic 
plan is scheduled for Jan. 28, 4:30-
6 p.m. at the Posner Center. One of 
our priorities for the discussion is 
an exploration of what a “Transfor-
mative CMU Experience” means for 
students. We encourage Carnegie 
Mellon students — undergrad, mas-
ters, and doctoral — to attend this 
meeting and share your perspectives 
with others who are invested in the 
future of the university.
We are at an exciting time in his-
tory as experts around the world are 
contemplating how higher educa-
tion will reinvent itself in the face 
of many new challenges and op-
portunities. Institutions are explor-
ing and adopting elements such as 
online learning, ?ipped classrooms, 
modular micro-courses, collabora-
tive capstones, residential learning 
commons, entrepreneurial sand-
boxes and global engagement part-
nerships, just to name a few. What 
will, or should, the residential col-
lege experience of the future look 
like? As Carnegie Mellon develops 
its own plan for the years to come, 
it is important for us as a commu-
nity to af?rm the core elements of 
the Carnegie Mellon student experi-
ence and determine what makes us 
distinctive, what bold experiments 
should be tested, and what expertise 
we have to offer to advance learning 
on our campus and beyond. 
Some campuses de?ne an edu-
cation by a list of required courses, 
and divide the student experience 
into what happens inside and out-
side of the classroom. From our 
earliest days as an institution, we at 
Carnegie Mellon have recognized 
the importance of an integrated ap-
proach that embraces the idea that 
the whole of the student experience 
is more than the sum of its parts. 
We encourage students to be 
active learners, creative thinkers, 
real-world problem solvers, and in-
terdisciplinary collaborators. Our 
students pursue unique educational 
experiences that combine intellec-
tual passions and focused study with 
applied learning and community en-
gagement. As we look to the future, 
how do we build on this foundation?
There are many initiatives and 
programs across campus that are the 
direct product of student ideas and 
action. What is your idea? We hope 
you will take the time and share 
with us. Please consider coming to 
the meeting on Jan. 28. If you can-
not make the meeting, visit www.
cmu.edu/strategic-plan, where you 
can put your thoughts in writing. 
Every comment is recorded and 
considered, because every perspec-
tive is valued. It’s an exciting time to 
be at Carnegie Mellon, and we look 
forward to imagining the future to-
gether with you.

cation and Gina Casalegno, Dean of 
Student Affairs.
Marriage equality gearing up for win, but war must go on
ARIEL HOFFMAIER
Marriage equality is on its ?nal 
victory lap. New wins are arriving 
faster than most Americans are both-
ering to keep track of them, and the 
Supreme Court may ?nally take a 
stand on the issue once and for all.
It’s been an eventful year and a 
half since the Defense of Marriage 
Act (DOMA) and Proposition 8 were 
repealed in June 2013. Same-sex 
couples have gained the freedom to 
marry in 23 states, adding to an in-
credible total of 36 states, as reported 
by GLAAD. Bans have been declared 
unconstitutional in an additional 10 
states, pending appeal. The last four 
strongholds against marriage equal-
ity — Georgia, Louisiana, Nebraska, 
and North Dakota — are 
predictably located 
in rural America. 
However, it seems 
only a matter of 
time before 
they cave 
to the 
pressure 
of history, 
as Alabama did only this Friday.
Through all of these develop-
ments, the Supreme Court has main-
tained a lackadaisical, hands-off atti-
tude. It set up the game of dominoes 
by repealing DOMA, but up until now 
the court has seemed content to sim-
ply let same-marriage bans become 
obsolete one state at a time. The U.S. 
Court of Appeals for the 6th Circuit 
changed the Supreme Court’s think-
ing. The 6th Circuit broke the prec-
edent set by all prior circuits by up-
holding same-sex marriage bans in 
Ohio, Michigan, Kentucky and Ten-
nessee. As such, on Jan. 16 the Su-
preme Court announced their inten-
tion to take on representative cases 
from these states, with a verdict ex-
pected in June.
The Supreme Court will settle 
their stance on two questions. The 
?rst is whether same-sex couples 
have the right to marry in all 50 
states, and the second is whether all 
50 states have the ob-
ligation to recognize 
same-sex mar-
riages licenses is-
sued legally 
out-of-state. At this point, all signs 
point toward a positive on both ques-
tions. An anti-marriage equality 
ruling would be a logistical night-
mare for the government, annulling 
thousands of formerly recognized 
marriages and exponentially compli-
cating tax law, as discussed in Slate 
magazine.
Plus, a negative ruling would be 
disastrous for public opinion. The 
majority of Americans are in favor 
of nationwide marriage equality, 
and 70 percent of the population is 
currently experiencing it, according 
to The Huf?ngton Post. In plenty of 
ways, we’re already living in a post-
marriage discrimination world. If the 
Supreme Court were to avoid strik-
ing the ?nal blow, based on the prec-
edent America has been building for 
years, it would be more than a head-
scratcher; it’d be abject foolishness.
Now, let’s just say that we win. 
June comes, and the United States 
becomes the 
19th na-
tion where 
same-sex 
cou-
ples can freely marry. What happens 
then? As GLAAD President and CEO 
Sarah Kate Ellis warns: “Even as we 
look forward to the Supreme Court’s 
decision, we must also remember 
that marriage equality in America is 
a benchmark, not a ?nish line.”
America likes its progress narra-
tives. We like a good rags-to-riches 
tale of overcoming adversity and ar-
riving at some concrete point of suc-
cess. The ?ght for marriage equality 
— state by state, culminating in that 
?nal Supreme Court smackdown — 
is a perfect example of the satisfying 
progress narrative. Unfortunately, 
the progress narrative is a myth. So-
ciety isn’t pushing forward to any set 
point; history is set in its path of one 
step forward, two steps back, a few 
more steps sideways, and probably 
even a cha-cha real smooth for good 
measure.
Many legal and social changes are 
visible and worthwhile, and many go 
on to improve the lives 
of thousands or 
millions in very 
real ways. 
But rac-
ism didn’t go away with abolition 
and it wasn’t obliterated by the Civil 
Rights Act. Neither did sexism vanish 
with the 19th Amendment or Roe v. 
Wade. Marriage equality will not end 
homophobia, and anyone who claims 
otherwise was probably never much 
of an ally in the ?rst place.
We must start arming ourselves 
against the opponents who are com-
ing: those who will use marriage 
equality to silence activists for all re-
maining LGBTQ concerns. Freedom 
to marry pales a little in comparison 
to the freedom many queer people 
still lack to openly live their lives 
without fear of discrimination, preju-
dice, and violence. 
As we celebrate this huge victory, 
we must avoid falling into the prog-
ress narrative’s trap. It will be better 
by far to focus on those individuals 
who are still in need of change, and 
who will continue to be for the fore-
see-able future.

SUPER BOWL COVERAGE
Media-powered Super Bowl frenzy descends on America
CARL GLAZER
Senior Staffwriter
The popularity of the Super 
Bowl is based on just about ev-
erything but the game played 
on the ?eld. 
Sure, the game features the 
two theoretically “best” teams, 
but as last year’s blowout fea-
turing the Seattle Seahawks 
and — what we were told 
was —  the Denver Broncos 
showed us, the mantra of “any 
given Sunday” can apply to 
blowouts just as easily as it can 
to upsets and comebacks.
There is a fairly good 
chance that this Super Bowl 
could be far less entertaining 
than the Seahawks’ crazy 
come-from-behind overtime 
victory last week in the NFC 
Championship Game over the 
Green Bay Packers or the New 
England Patriots coming back 
from not one, but two 14 point 
de?cits in the divisional round 
against the Baltimore Ra-
vens. Toss those on top of the 
controversy and media circus 
surrounding the Dallas Cow-
boys’ two playoff games (the 
picked up ?ag vs the Detroit 
Lions and the clearly — but 
not technically — caught pass 
against the Packers) and I’m 
willing to bet that the most 
entertaining football that this 
season has to offer is past us.
What truly makes the Super 
Bowl “super” is the surround-
ing entertainment. You have 
sports (and now news) media 
covering and breaking down 
every aspect of the Seahawks 
and Patriots, arguing about 
possible personnel match-
ups; how Seattle’s “Legion of 
Boom,” with shutdown corner 
Richard Sherman and hard hit-
ting safety Earl Thomas both 
nursing injuries, can match up 
against the human wrecking 
ball that is New England Patri-
ots tight end Rob Gronkowski 
and wide receiver/trick play 
quarterback Julian Edelman; 
or if the Seahawks’ lack of a 
fundamental passing attack 
can be a bene?t against the Pa-
triots’ top corner Darrelle Re-
vis and former Legion of Boom 
member cornerback Brendan 
Browner, the strengths of the 
revamped Patriot defense.
These conversations take 
place as the ?ller pieces be-
tween the things that “really” 
matter, such as “De?ate-gate,” 
a.k.a. “Ball-ghazi.” The ac-
cusations that New England 
intentionally de?ated their 
game balls 2 psi below the 
regulated minimum has led to 
a more detailed reading and 
breakdown of a non-gameplay 
aspect of the league’s rulebook 
than many of the fans gave to 
their college textbooks, and 
has seen the Ideal Gas Law 
get more media attention than 
at any other point in history. 
This may be the only scandal 
the NFL is enjoying, given it 
has turned the spotlight away 
from the league’s many issues 
with domestic violence, most 
notably surrounding Ray Rice, 
Adrian Peterson and Greg 
Hardy, and the recent report 
which proved the NFL com-
missioners’ of?ce of being both 
utterly incompetent in the in-
vestigation and of blatantly ly-
ing to both the owners and the 
press back in September, in a 
matter very similar to former 
Raven Ray Lewis’ deer antler 
spray controversy before their 
appearance in the 2012 Su-
per Bowl which masked the 
New Orleans Saints bounty 
aftermath.
All of these controversies 
and media stories still only 
focus on the football aspect 
of the Super Bowl, which, 
while most important, is by 
no means the only reason mil-
lions of Americans tune in on 
Superbowl Sunday. The half-
time show is one of the biggest 
and shortest concerts of the 
year, with as many watching 
for the enjoyment of music as 
to hate-watch the performers 
(the Black Eyed Peas’ techni-
cal malfunctions in 2011) or 
enjoy the eye-candy effects 
and performers while secretly 
hoping for another wardrobe 
malfunction à la Janet Jack-
son. This year’s combo of Katy 
Perry and Lenny Kravitz marks 
the second straight year (Bru-
no Mars and the Red Hot Chili 
Peppers last year) of a young 
pop star mashing up with a 
newish rock act to try and ap-
pease everyone while thrilling 
no one.
The ?nal piece of the Super 
Bowl media megastorm is the 
one thing current society is 
working ever so hard to phase 
out: commercials. 
In the age where everyone 
has a DVR — assuming they 
even still have cable — Ad 
Block is the most-used exten-
sion, and pirating/streaming 
on demand media is viewed 
as a way to minimize pre-
cious viewing seconds being 
wasted on ads, the Super Bowl 
has transformed advertising 
from nuisance to entertain-
ment. With hundreds of top 
ten lists of funniest, most clas-
sic, raciest, and worst Super 
Bowl commercials, they have 
become as much a part of the 
game as the football itself. 
Millions of dollars are spent 
on the airtime alone, not ac-
counting for the production 
budget. The big game is the 
one time people prefer you to 
talk over the program and not 
the ads, as the color commen-
tators generally have far less to 
offer than an ad from Doritos 
or Budweiser.
All of the hype for all three 
aspects of the game is pushed 
by the media. If you wanted 
to see in-depth breakdowns 
of the match ups of giant Se-
ahawks safety Kam Chancellor 
and Gronkowski, or New Eng-
land middle linebacker Dont’a 
Hightower and Seattle half-
back Marshawn “Beast Mode” 
Lynch, and somehow haven’t 
found one yet, you just are 
not trying hard enough. Same 
goes for “De?ate-gate,” which 
led all three national news 
broadcasts Thursday evening, 
or Lynch’s perpetual ?nes for 
inappropriate celebration/
lack of media cooperation. We 
haven’t even hit Super Bowl 
media day, and ESPN has been 
all NFL all the time with minor 
inconvenient interruptions for 
the NBA.
At the end of the day, I 
think the Seahawks will win 
a close game 21-20, but ul-
timately that’s not why we 
care. Sure, one of the nation’s 
northern shoreline commu-
nities will be ecstatic and the 
other in a likely drunken rage, 
but for the vast majority of us, 
we are merely spectators hop-
ing to be entertained. 
And while there are no 
guarantees that the game 
will provide that (conspiracy 
theories of Jerry Jones and 
the Cowboys ?xing the playoff 
game against the Lions aside), 
halftime and the commercials 
will.
If you really want to make 
the game matter, Vegas and 
the Internet have you covered 
with more prop bets than any 
one reasonable human could 
ever think of (coin toss head 
or tails, length of the national 
anthem, color of the Gatorade 
tossed on the winning coaches 
head and movement of the 
stock market the next day just 
to name a few non-game re-
lated ones). 
But, really, just sit back, 
knock back a few beers (or 
root beers, depending on age) 
and enjoy the perfect storm of 
entertainment as created and 
developed by the media and 
the world’s most media-driven 
league.
SPORTS BRIEFS
Swimming & Diving
In their ?nal home meet 
of the season, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
swimming and diving teams 
hosted Denison University on 
Saturday. Unfortunately, this 
was not a happy end to the 
Tartans’ home season as Deni-
son, ranked 2nd in Division III 
men’s swimming and diving 
and 3rd in women’s, outpaced 
Carnegie Mellon in almost ev-
ery event and took their foot 
off the gas as they cruised to a 
170–104 win over the women 
and a 174–95 win over the 
men.
Each team was able to pick 
up a lone swimming win, with 
junior Kira Singahus grabbing 
the 100 yard backstroke with 
a time of 59.87 for the women 
and sophomore Brian Walsh 
getting the men’s sole ?rst 
place ?nished with a 1:52.50 
?nish in the 200 yard butter-
?y. On the diving side, sopho-
more Machika Kaku put up the 
top score in the 1 meter diving 
with a time of 296.10 while 
the men continued the diving 
woes that have been plaguing 
them all season.
The rest of the meet was a 
severe beating on the Tartans, 
with the score only looking 
close once Denison began put-
ting several of their top teams 
as exhibitions to ensure Carn-
egie Mellon got some more 
scoring points.
The Tartans will not 
have much time to lick their 
wounds as they face off next 
weekend against University of 
Pittsburgh.
Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s track and 
?eld teams traveled to Deni-
son on Saturday to compete 
in the Lid–Lifter Invitational. 
The men won the event with 
111.5 team points, over 20 
more than the runner-up, and 
the women placed in second 
with 89.5 points, only placing 
behind Division II California 
University of Pa.
The men dominated the 
800-meter run, taking ?ve of 
the top six spots. Led by win-
ning senior Thomas Vanden-
berg with a time of 1:54.09, 
the Tartans swept spots 3–6 
with junior Marc–Daniel Ju-
lien, sophomore Owen Norley, 
junior Thomas Mayo–Smith 
and ?rst-year Evan Larrick ?n-
ishing with times of 1:58.34, 
2:00.74, 2:00.91 and 2:01.77, 
respectively. Sophomore 
Curtis Watro continued the 
streak with a ?rst place win 
in the mile run with a time of 
4:28.14, being beaten only by 
a Denison Alumni.
The men kept up the dis-
tance domination in the dis-
tance relay with the team 
of seniors Eamon Cullinane 
and Benjamin Walker along 
with ?rst-years Anirudh Ra-
makrishnan and Joseph Pick-
ens winning with a time of 
10:56.25 and sophomore 
Brian Bollens placing second 
in the 3000 meter run with a 
time of 9:04.90.
On the women’s side, they 
also excelled in the distance 
runs taking the top three and 
?ve of the top six in the 3000 
meter run. Senior Sophie 
Lohman won the event in a 
time of 11:10.91, with junior 
Kira Ragazzo and ?rst-year 
Natalie Smith rounding out 
the top three with times of 
11:12.96 and 11:17.31, re-
spectively. First-years Aparna 
Alavilli and Rhiannon Farney 
took ?fth and sixth with times 
of 11:30.95 and 11:39.65 re-
spectively.
The women also took sec-
ond in the 4x400 meter relay 
with ?rst-years Jerilyn James 
and Sarah Cook along with 
sophomores Emily Swanson 
and Ariel Tian combining for 
a time of 4:18.20. In the ?eld 
events, sophomore Rebecca 
Fortner had a second-place 
?nish in the high jump clear-
ing the 1.52 meter bar.
The Tartans will next com-
pete Saturday at Case Western 
Reserve University.

SUPER BOWL COVERAGE
What to watch for: matchup problems in Super Bowl XLIX
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
Football is always a game 
of matchups. In no particular 
order, here are ?ve things that 
might swing this year’s Super 
Bowl:
1. The Seahawks have had 
a lot of trouble covering tight 
ends this year. Two examples 
in particular stand out. The 
?rst is their utter failure to con-
tain San Diego Chargers’ tight 
end Antonio Gates earlier in 
the season. He exploded in the 
red zone, as he was too quick 
and too large a target for the 
Seahawks’ linebacking corps, 
and caught three touchdowns 
for the day. The second is the 
Seahawks’ bizarre schematic 
hiccup against the Kansas City 
Chiefs. Chiefs’ tight end Travis 
Kelce did not collect a ton of 
stats, but the Seahawks line-
backers bent their zones heav-
ily in Kelce’s direction, which 
opened up a ton of room for 
the Chiefs running game and 
led to a big day from Chiefs 
halfback Jamaal Charles. The 
Seahaws rank 18th in Football 
Outsiders’ DVOA (Defensive 
Value Over Average) against 
tight ends and also struggle 
with passes in the seams, so 
New England Patriots’ tight 
end Rob Gronkowski, a player 
who combines Kelce’s size and 
strength with Gates’s athleti-
cism, could have yet another 
monster day for the Pats. If the 
Seahawks choose to collapse 
on him, Patriots halfback Le-
Garette Blount might bene?t 
the holes they leave.
2. While Patriots’ corner-
back Darelle Revis has been 
solid on the right (from the 
offense’s perspective) side 
of the ?eld, former Seahawk 
cornerback Brandon Browner 
has left a gaping hole in New 
England’s defense on the oth-
er side. The team ranks 17th 
in DVOA on passes to second 
wide receivers and 27th on 
defending passes to the left 
side. While the Seahawks are 
not exactly known for their il-
lustrious wide receiver corps, 
wide receiver Jermaine Kearse 
has exploded in recent weeks, 
including the playoffs, and he 
occupies a space where the Pa-
triots are very weak. He could 
have a huge impact on the out-
come.
3. New England has a huge 
special teams advantage in 
this game, ranking ?fth in 
DVOA to Seattle’s 19th. New 
England kicker Stephen Gots-
kowski has much more range 
and consistency than his Se-
ahawks’ counterpart Stephen 
Hauschka. Throw in New 
England’s success with punt 
returns and the Seahawks’ 
extraordinary season long dif-
?culty with them and ?eld po-
sition could have a huge effect 
in this one.
4. The Patriots do not have 
a very versatile front seven. 
Beyond outside linebacker 
Dont’a Hightower, everyone in 
their defensive front is either a 
run stopper who is too slow to 
rush the passer or a pass rush-
er who has trouble adjusting 
to run plays. This is a disaster 
against Seattle’s quarterback 
Russell Wilson, and halfback 
Marshawn Lynch. Wilson has 
an incredible ability to duck 
pass rushers and either throw 
the ball or make plays with his 
feet. Considering the Patriots’ 
trouble in coverage, this could 
lead to some huge gains, and 
Wilson will not have to do too 
much to avoid the Patriots 
pass rush. Lynch could also 
have a ?eld day, as New Eng-
land’s pass rush often takes 
itself out of run plays leaving 
two or three guys in the box. 
Lynch breaks three man tack-
les in his sleep. We might be 
in for another beast quake. 
There’s really nothing the Se-
ahawks do that plays into the 
Patriots’ strengths.
5. Patriots’ wide receiver 
Brandon LaFell is 6’3” and 
210 pounds. This is margin-
ally larger than the giant Se-
ahawks cornerbacks trying to 
cover him. Other than that, the 
Patriots have a tiny wide re-
ceiver corps by NFL standards. 
This could be an issue since 
it decreases the target size 
for Patriots’ quarterback Tom 
Brady to something that is eas-
ily covered by the likes of Se-
ahawks cornerbacks Richard 
Sherman and Byron Maxwell, 
6’3” and 195 pounds and 6’1” 
and 207 pounds respectively. 
Throw in Seahawks’ safeties 
Kam Chancellor, a man who 
was once described by Sher-
man as a “destroyer of souls,” 
and Earl Thomas, the best 
coverage safety in the league, 
and it could be a long day for 
the Patriots’ wide receivers. 
The factor of the de?ated foot-
balls is not to be discounted 
here either. A solid estimate 
says Brady started authorizing 
the de?ation shortly after the 
Chiefs embarrassed him on 
national TV, a moment when 
his accuracy bizarrely spiked 
for three months. The foot-
balls will likely not be de?ated 
this weekend, which could 
cause a minor decrease in pre-
cision, further exaggerating 
this issue.
Either way, it should be a 
close and exciting game.
CMU basketball teams split
CARL GLAZER

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s basket-
ball teams took a road trip to 
Rochester on Friday to contin-
ue University Athletic Associ-
ation (UAA) conference play 
in a double header against 
University of Rochester.
The women kicked off the 
evening trying to shake off 
their back-to-back home loss-
es last weekend and took the 
quick lead with an opening 
layup by sophomore center 
Lisa Murphy. Unfortunately, 
that 2–0 led was the only ad-
vantage the Tartans were go-
ing to get in the opening half. 
They quickly fell in a hole as 
the team was cold on the of-
fensive end. The only saving 
grace was Rochester’s simi-
lar shooting woes, exacer-
bated by the Tartans’ defense, 
which caused the de?cit to 
never climb to more than 7 
and let Tartans go on a run 
to end the half, culminating 
in junior forward Liza Otto’s 
game tying jump shot with 
11 seconds left in the half to 
send the teams into the locker 
room knotted up at 23–23.
In the second half, the 
teams played to a draw 
through the ?rst 14 minutes 
of the period with the score 
tied at 44 apiece going into 
the home stretch. The Tar-
tans took the lead for good 
with ?rst-year guard Njaire 
Mckoy’s jump shot with just 
under six minutes to go, but 
didn’t start creating separa-
tion from the Yellowjackets 
until Murphy rattled off 6 
straight free throws and se-
nior guard Chandler Cau?eld 
hit a three-pointer and two 
more free throws to push the 
lead to double digits. Junior 
guard Lindsay Poss, freshman 
forward Zoe Zawisa and Mur-
phy made their free throws as 
the clock wound down to seal 
the victory at 68–57. Murphy 
?nished the game with a dou-
ble–double (29 points and 16 
rebounds) to go along with a 
perfect 13–13 from the free 
throw line.
While the win is certainly 
a happy one for the Tartans 
as it pushes them to 2–2 in 
UAA play and 10–4 on the 
season, there was cause for 
concern with Carnegie Mel-
lon continuing the shooting 
issues that have plagued them 
throughout conference play, 
having shot under 40% from 
the ?eld in all four games.
The men’s team also came 
out with something to prove 
after losing their last game 
against New York University 
on a missed game tying three-
pointer as the clock ran down. 
Coming with a vengeance, the 
Tartans scored the ?rst three 
baskets to jump to an early 
6–0 lead.
Unfortunately, Roches-
ter quickly recovered to turn 
the game into a dog ?ght 
throughout the half with nei-
ther team able to gain more 
than three points of breath-
ing room on the scoreboard 
until a layup by sophomore 
center Chris Shkil made the 
Tartan lead 4 and the Tartans 
pushed it all the way to ?ve 
on a three-pointer by senior 
guard Jasen Blakeny, before 
two Rochester free throws cut 
the Tartans’ lead to 33–30 go-
ing into half time.
Coming out of half, it was 
more of the same for the ?rst 
?ve minutes until a series of 
Tartan turnovers and missed 
shots let the Yellowjackets 
go on a 14–0 run that Carn-
egie Mellon could just barely 
recover from. The Tartans 
fought back and managed 
to cut the de?cit to three on 
three-pointer by junior guard 
Jason Sebak but a layup and 
successful free throw on the 
and one attempt pushed the 
lead to 6 and sealed the game 
with Carnegie Mellon losing 
65–60.
The loss drops the Tartans 
to 1–3 in UAA play and 10–5 
on the season. Sophomore 
forward Jack Serbin led the 
losing effort as the top scorer 
and rebounder with 11 points 
and 12 rebounds for another 
double double.
Both Carnegie Mellon 
teams played Sunday in At-
lanta against Emory and will 
continue their conference 
road play next weekend when 
they travel to Washington 
University of St. Louis and the 
University of Chicago.
Super Bowl Fast Facts
  The Super Bowl was created in 1967, when the NFL 
and rival AFL decided to play each other in a “world” 
championship until the merger in 1970.  This game was 
initially referred to as a “Super Bowl” by Larry Hunt, 
owner of the Kansas City Chiefs.  It may or may not have 
been loosely based on the “Super Ball” toy his children 
were playing with at the time.

Kevin Steinhouse smashes CMU records in rookie season
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
“[Swimming is] an outlet 
for all the stresses life brings,” 
?rst-year electrical and com-
puter engineering (ECE) 
major and swimmer Kevin 
Steinhouse said as we sat in 
the Gates Hillman Complex’s 
Fifth Floor Commons. “[It 
makes me] a little more calm 
coming out of practices.”
It better: The schedule 
Steinhouse endures as a swim-
mer would make most Carn-
egie Mellon students balk. 
His mornings start at 5:20 
a.m. on Monday, Wednesday, 
and Friday, when many of us 
are just putting the ?nishing 
touches on our homework. He 
dedicates himself to his sport, 
however, and it shows.
Steinhouse currently holds 
the school record for the 50-
yard freestyle with a time of 
20.77 seconds and also has 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
swim team’s best time on the 
year for the 100-yard freestyle 
at 46.33 seconds. Steinhouse 
knew coming in that he had 
come close to these times in 
high school, and made it his 
goal to surpass them, some-
thing he did just as the swim 
team’s season began. Already 
a record holder, Steinhouse 
still has much more he wishes 
to accomplish as both a Carn-
egie Mellon student and a 
swimmer.
Much of Steinhouse’s suc-
cess can be attributed to his 
training. While he was close 
to the record times he set 
at Carnegie Mellon, he says 
he has improved by adding 
weight training to his rou-
tine, something he had not 
done before. He speci?cally 
mentioned the use of power 
racks, a device that provides 
weighted resistance against 
him swimming. 
About two weeks before 
meets, he will lower the in-
tensity of his training, allow-
ing himself to recover and be 
at peak performance for large 
meets.
Steinhouse gives some of 
the credit for his motivation 
to his teammates, particularly 
senior chemical engineering 
major Josh Lucheon.
“When it matters most, he 
steps up,” said Steinhouse. 
However, it wasn’t always 
that way. In Steinhouse’s 
high school, people were 
mandated to play a sport, so 
many who were on the swim 
team were not competitive 
swimmers. 
“Only about ?ve or six 
people actually wanted to be 
there,” he said.
He prefers college, where 
the depth of talent and enjoy-
ment for swimming makes 
the environment more com-
petitive and, in his eyes, more 
fun. The appreciation for the 
teammates around him has 
also contributed to competi-
tive success, where he par-
ticipated in the 200-yard free-
style relay that broke another 
school record at 1:23.50 and 
might send that squad to the 
NCAA tournament.
Steinhouse’s athletic goals 
are not complete, though. In 
addition to breaking the 50-
yard freestyle record, he has 
quali?ed for the NCAA B-cut 
in that event. He has his eyes 
set on the one hundred-yard 
freestyle record, which he 
plans on breaking before the 
end of the year.
Steinhouse has been an 
athlete for a long time, join-
ing a summer league when he 
was four. However, he was not 
a competitive swimmer until 
his sophomore year of high 
school. He played soccer and 
basketball, and swimming 
was not his primary high 
school sport; that distinction 
belonged to water polo. He 
plans to join the club water 
polo team after swimming 
season is over.
In addition to being a 
swimmer, Steinhouse also 
has an interest in science. He 
said that early on he knew he 
wanted to involve math and 
science in his studies and set-
tled on engineering. An af?n-
ity for programming pushed 
him toward ECE speci?cally, 
and he picked out 15-112 as 
a favorite class. While college 
surprised him with its dif?cul-
ty, he claims to be adjusting 
well to his new surroundings. 
His success in the swimming 
pool shows he can adapt well 
to new surroundings.
While ?rst-year students 
often struggle amid the tu-
mult of a new home and a 
new team, Steinhouse has 
truly shone as an athlete. Less 
than a season into his time 
here at Carnegie Mellon, his 
swimming accomplishments 
have likely just scratched the 
surface of his potential.

Breaking a school record in 
varsity basketball is an accom-
plishment that every athlete 
strives for, but one that only 
a brilliant few reach. Sopho-
more psychology major Lisa 
Murphy plays for the women’s 
basketball team and broke not 
one or two, but ?ve school re-
cords in her ?rst year.
Murphy’s remarkable jour-
ney began in the third grade, 
when Murphy’s passion for 
sports shone through as she 
joined her House League and 
was involved in a multitude of 
sports. 
Unlike most athletes, Mur-
phy did not have any expecta-
tions from the time she put 
into sports; all she wanted 
was to have fun with it — an 
attribute that she admirably 
still holds on to today.
Murphy ?rst grew close to 
basketball as a sport during 
her ?rst year of high school. 
It was then that she started 
to admire the beauty of the 
sport and the skill it required. 
Despite not being let onto 
her varsity team during her 
?rst year, Murphy exhibited 
her tenacity by practicing 
harder and building herself 
as a player until she became 
a starter on her varsity team 
in her sophomore year. Since 
then, she has plowed through 
obstacles and achieved goal 
after goal as she scores point 
after point on the court. She 
attributes much of her success 
to the guidance of her high 
school Coach Michael O’Brien 
and the support and love of 
her family.
Murphy chose to continue 
her already impressive high 
school career at Carnegie 
Mellon because she felt that 
“it had all the little puzzle 
pieces” that she wanted in a 
school: A good program for 
her major, location in a cool 
city, great teammates and a 
fantastic coaching staff. Mur-
phy has a multidimensional 
personality, and wanted to 
study psychology to pursue 
her desire of working with 
children with special needs 
in a therapeutic setting in 
the future. When it came to 
basketball, all that mattered 
to Murphy was being “part 
of a growing, on-the-rise pro-
gram where [she] could have 
an impact.” And so began her 
Tartan tale.
Murphy, whose game re-
volved around ?nesse (much 
like her idol Tim Duncan), 
had to adjust to the increased 
pace and physicality of col-
lege basketball. Nonethe-
less, Murphy came in ready 
to work hard once again and 
had no expectations from 
all that she put in. Murphy 
started all twenty six games 
in her freshman year and led 
the team in points, rebounds 
and blocks. She was named 
UAA Rookie of the Year and 
made it to the All-UAA First 
Team. She set school records 
in points scored, ?eld goals 
made, ?eld-goal percent-
age, free throws made and 
free throws attempted. This 
was not enough for Murphy, 
whose focus still remains on 
improving as an individual 
and as part of the Tartans. 
It is hardly a surprise, then, 
that she draws great inspira-
tion from Head Coach Jacquie 
Hullah, who Murphy holds 
in high regard for the coach’s 
ability to facilitate team and 
individual development.
When asked about her 
daily basketball mindset, she 
had this to say: “I just want to 
work hard on the court and 
support my teammates. I try 
to use my agility and ?nesse 
to trump the opposition, and 
am working on other facets of 
my game as well.”
Despite brilliant indepen-
dent performances, the Tar-
tan girls have not managed 
to hold onto their leads for 
the last two games. Murphy 
admitted that she thinks the 
Tartans need to maintain 
their opening communica-
tion and execution and ac-
knowledged that she wanted 
to focus more on getting into 
position, avoiding double 
teams and kicking the ball out 
in time. Murphy’s aims for the 
next few games are to help 
her teammates dictate the 
tempo of the game and force 
the opposition to play Tartan 
basketball.
It is inspiring to see how 
Murphy has grown from a 
young girl who used to play 
with her elder brother using 
the hoop in their backyard to 
a college varsity player who 
is a force to be reckoned with 
both on and off the court.

Festive champagne cupcakes
Treat your valentine to these strawberry-infused goodies
For my first cupcakes of the semester, I’d like to 
look back to winter break, but also look forward to 
Valentine’s Day.
I made these cupcakes for my family’s New Year’s 
Eve party, and they were so delicious and festive. 
Champagne is such a classic New Year’s staple, 
but the addition of the strawberry really made the 
cupcakes brighter, both in color and flavor. Not to 
brag, but I think they were the most successful 
dessert there, even beating out all of the leftover 
Christmas cookies that everyone brought just to get 
rid of.
With Valentine’s Day just on the horizon, this is 
a great flavor to resurrect. Both strawberries and 
champagne just scream romance! Making these is 
sure to tell your sweetie how much you love them. 
So ditch the roses this year; cupcakes taste so much 
better.
Champagne Cupcakes
Adapted from “Sprinkle Bakes”
http://www.sprinklebakes.com/2010/12/sparkling-
champagne-cupcakes.html
1 stick of butter, room temperature
1 cup of sugar
2 eggs
1 teaspoon of vanilla
1 3/4 cups of flour
1/2 teaspoon of baking soda
1/4 teaspoon of baking powder
1/4 teaspoon of salt
1/2 cup of sour cream
1 cup of champagne
Strawberry Champagne Frosting
1 cup of champagne, rosé if available
2 sticks of butter, room temperature
2 1/2 cups of powdered sugar
1/4 cup of chopped strawberries
Instructions
To start, preheat the oven to 350 ºF, and put cupcake 
liners in 17 of the spots on a cupcake tray. (I thought 
17 was a crazy number when I read the recipe, but I 
actually had enough batter for exactly 17 cupcakes.) 
Set aside all dry ingredients in a separate bowl for 
later. This includes the flour, baking powder, baking 
soda, and salt.
For the batter, start by creaming the butter and 
sugar until they’re nice and fluffy, a step made much 
easier with an electric mixer. Then smell it, because 
it gives off the world’s most heavenly smell. Add the 
eggs and vanilla, then stir, scraping the bottom of 
the bowl if it looks like the eggs and butter aren’t 
mixing. Start bringing it all together by adding about 
one-third of the dry ingredients, followed by half of 
the sour cream; alternate adding those amounts to 
the bowl until all the dry ingredients are mixed in. 
Finally, gently stir in the champagne. Scoop all the 
cupcakes and bake for about 17 minutes, or until the 
cake feels bouncy when you poke it.
The frosting takes much longer than normal 
buttercream, so start making it as soon as you put 
the cupcakes in the oven, if not before. Place the 
champagne and strawberries into a small pot and 
simmer on medium-high heat until they reduce 
down to between two and four tablespoons. It will 
take a while, so be patient! Depending on how 
small you cut the berries, there still may be some 
chunks left, so strain those out. Then, start your 
frosting by beating the butter until it’s creamy. Stir 
in the powdered sugar a little at a time so that you 
don’t make a mess, and finally, add the reduced 
champagne — and that’s it! These look beautiful 
when frosted with a star tip and finished with some 
red sprinkles, but most important of all, serve them 
with love.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I’m in the process of 
applying for masters of 
education programs — I 
want to teach second 
graders because I 
don’t feel comfortable 
conversing with people 
my own age — and 
yesterday I got my first 
acceptance! Not to a very 
good school, but still. 
But then I took a day off 
and watched YouTube 
videos for most of the 
day, and I found this one 
I had watched back when 
I was a senior, called 
“Gap Yah.” It’s a stupid, 
annoying video with some 
pretentious guy with an 
unplaced accent talking 
about how he traveled 
the world and drank 
too much and threw up 
everywhere.
But then I got to thinking: 
Why can’t I do that? Why 
can’t I travel the world 
and make an ass of 
myself before I go to grad 
school?
Ponderously,
Longing After Zeitgeist, 
Yearning Especially for 
Xenophilic Contingencies 
and Unregulated Smoking 
of Esra
Dear LAZY EXCUSE,
I don’t think anyone uses the 
term “esra” to refer to weed 
anymore, but good on you 
for trying to bring it back! 
Make it your own.
So, this whole gap year 
thing: It’s splendid idea 
if you want to spend the 
money and time required, 
and I’ve heard it’s a helluva 
deep spiritual journey. But 
you really shouldn’t use the 
“Gap Yah” guy as your point 
of reference for such an 
important issue.
He’s not exactly the best 
role model: Whenever he 
comes across something 
remotely life changing 
or breathtaking, he “just 
chunders everywhere.” 
The next thing you know, 
you’ll be pronouncing 
Peru as “Perah,” calling 
global climate change “an 
insignificant truth,” and 
getting arrested by Burmese 
law enforcement for 
disturbing the peace.
Then again, you could 
make it your goal to drink 
every kind of liquor known 
to man in a year, sleep on 
a different-smelling couch 
in a different country every 
night, and finally discover 
the difference between 
potato seasonings in Eastern 
Europe. And then, you share 
those experiences with your 
wide-eyed second-grade 
students.
Best night of my life, best 
night of my life,
Evan Kahn

---------------------------------------------------

I told myself last week that I would not write a review of 
Fall Out Boy’s new album American Beauty/American 
Psycho when it dropped on Jan. 16. I’m too biased.
“Grand Theft Autumn/Where Is Your Boy,” from 2003’s 
Take This to Your Grave was the ?rst song I ever 
completely memorized in seventh grade. And “Dance, 
Dance,” from 2005’s From Under the Cork Tree, played 
on repeat on my iPod Mini for at least a month.
Needless to say, I’m a shameless Fall Out Boy fan, and 
I couldn’t resist this review. I never thought I’d like 
anything the band put out recently as much as what 
I deem their original music — everything before their 
hiatus. But American Beauty/American Psycho surprised 
me, because I like almost every song on it more than 
“Grand Theft Autumn” and “Dance, Dance.”
While the album isn’t likely to convert you if you didn’t 
like “Sugar, We’re Going Down,” the work on this album 
is easily Fall Out Boy’s best. It’s diverse, gritty, and out of 
all the mainstream music I listen to, there’s a number of 
sounds I’ve never heard on a track before.
The album opens with one of my favorites — but let’s 
be real, they’re all my favorites — “Irresistible,” which 
sets the tone of the album for something grand, with 
horns welcoming Patrick Stump’s wide range of vocals 
and ability to elongate the words “It’s irresistible” into a 
13-second catchy phrase of an even catchier chorus.
The band then throws itself into “American Beauty/
American Psycho” which, when paired with 
“Novocaine,” give the album its gritty quality. You might 
think the band crazy after they threaten you with the 
lines “If you knew what the blue birds sang at you/
you would never sing along” in “Novocaine” and an 
admission that they’re American psychos in the song of 
a similar title. But that’s what makes those songs fun.
Possibly my favorite song on the album, though, is one 
of the less popular (based on iTunes ratings): “Fourth 
of July.” The chorus goes like this: “It was the Fourth 
of July/You and I were/You and I were ?re-?reworks.” 
Simple, right? It’s so simple, and so catchy that when 
Stump belts it at the top of his lungs, you won’t be able 
to do anything else but belt it out with him.
And no review of this album would be complete without 
mentioning the effective sampling in “Uma Thurman,” 
“Centuries,” and “American Beauty/American Psycho.” 
“Uma Thurman” samples 1960s sitcom The Munsters’ 
theme song, “Centuries” samples Suzanne Vega’s 
“Tom’s Diner,” and “American Beauty/American Psycho” 
samples Motley Crüe’s “Too Fast for Love.” Okay, 
admittedly that’s a lot of sampling for one album. But 
it all works so well that it doesn’t matter, especially in 
“Centuries,” because who else remembers not being 
able to get “Tom’s Diner” out of their head after they ?rst 
heard it? Same applies to “Centuries.”
Of course, this album is still the old Fall Out Boy from 
before the hiatus, to an extent, meaning that it is angsty 
and in your face. There’s not much mellow about it, so 
if you’re looking for a quiet album, look somewhere else. 
It’s a little bit beautiful, de?nitely psycho. And that’s 
what makes it some of Fall Out Boy’s best music.

“If you ever get lonely, just go to the record store 
and visit your friends” — a line from the ?lm Almost 
Famous, which is a movie you should start watching 
right now if you haven’t seen it. It’s a quote I’ve always 
counted as one of my favorite unique arrangements 
of letters and syllables. A beautifully simple way of 
speaking a 10-volume opus entitled “Why I Love 
Music.”
In the ?rst few days of my journey spending a semester 
abroad in Shef?eld, England, I came to see a deeper 
meaning to it, speci?cally to the last three words. 
Seeing as I’m a brand-new student who’s only here for 
a semester, it’s unlikely I’ll make the kind of friends I 
have in the U.S. Without them, I’ve come to see that 
my only connections that come even remotely close 
to those across the Atlantic are with the friends in my 
headphones. Now I see that the 10-volume opus should 
really be titled “Why Music Matters to Me.”
Not to say I’m depressed or regretful — quite the 
contrary — but anyone who’s gone through culture 
shock will tell you the ?rst few days are damn dif?cult. 
Aside from the obvious homesickness and adjusting to 
new ways of eating and (in the U.K.) crossing the street, 
there is the challenge of breaking into an established 
social scene. It feels like I’m back in freshman year, 
but instead of being surrounded by countless other 
freshmen who are experiencing the same bewilderment 
and are as eager to form new relationships as I am, 
I’m surrounded by upperclassmen, many of whom are 
about to graduate. They have their friends and their 
routines that they’ve cultivated the same way I have 
mine in Pittsburgh, and they go about these routines 
normally.
The only thing is that I didn’t yet have a routine — 
there’s hardly been any schoolwork yet, and there’s 
only so much time you can spend on Net?ix before 
you begin to feel like a weird recluse. So to ?ll much 
of the afternoon free time I took walks around the city, 
exploring the nooks and crannies and seeing what 
happened when I took a left where I last took a right. I 
spent hours out there, and never once did I feel lonely 
or bored, because I had a pocketful of friends with me.
Kendrick Lamar told stories while we explored the 
shopping districts and peered into stores I had never 
heard of before, and Twiddle jammed for 20 minutes on 
a cheery tune even though it was drizzling and overcast 
on our walk to the Shef?eld Cathedral. Pretty Lights 
kept us both grooving along the bars and clubs on 
West Street while I took note of which ones had strict 
dress codes so I could avoid them. It was a good thing 
I kept the volume low, because Eminem likely would’ve 
gotten us kicked out of KFC. Also, English people love 
KFC. Images of the Colonel outnumber the Golden 
Arches by a decent margin.
It’s not only during the day that music has been the 
only guy there to hang out with me. One of my ?rst 
nights here, I was invited by my ?atmates to go to 
the nightclubs. After pre-drinks in our kitchen we 
took a taxi to the club. Then, when we got there, the 
bouncer wouldn’t let me inside. Something about how I 
“couldn’t stand up bloody straight.” My ?atmates kindly 
offered to head back with me, but I implored them to go 
enjoy their night.
Arriving back to an empty ?at, I hooked my phone up 
to the speakers in the kitchen, which before had been 
blaring a stream of thumping house songs that my 
untrained ear could hardly distinguish between, and 
turned “Maggie May” by Rod Stewart up to full volume. 
Waltzing around, belting out the lyrics and strumming 
my invisible mandolin in perfect time, I felt like I was at 
the most perfect birthday party that anyone could ever 
have thrown me. I went back and hit the replay button 
three more times.
Okay, perhaps I was pretty drunk.
I’ve taken a lot away from my ?rst week dropped in the 
middle of a strange sea, but a newfound appreciation 
for pieces of art I’d already deeply loved is certainly the 
most surprising. Songs that had meant little more than 
a lovely melody now mean home, and conjure memories 
of friends that I love and miss dearly.
There’s a long way to go, and I’ve seen enough 
PowerPoint slides and been handed enough advice to 
know these feelings of homesickness and isolation will 
pass. However, I also know that I’ll never forget how 
good these songs made me feel at a time when I really 
needed it. So far this whole “abroad” thing seems to be 
leaving a pretty great mark on me.

opera

School of Music’s Il mondo della luna charms audiences
Comic timing, musical excellence unite in performance of goofy 18th century opera 
This past weekend, students from the School of Music 
put on a sparkling and hysterical performance of Joseph 
Haydn’s opera Il mondo della luna. The libretto of the 
classical opera was written by Carlo Goldoni. The 
production, which featured the vocal and dramatic 
talents of Carnegie Mellon vocal performance students, 
was a ridiculous and enjoyable tale of trickery led by the 
character of Ecclitico, an astronomer played by master’s 
student in vocal performance Ricky Marenda. The show 
had two casts, with each cast performing on alternating 
days. I attended Friday night’s performance and was 
hugely impressed by all that I saw.
The curtains opened on a dazzling set with golden pillars 
made up of stacked astronomical signs and a twinkling 
backdrop of stars. The men’s chorus — consisting of 
Ecclitico’s students — joined their teacher in singing 
a song to the moon. Ecclitico told his students that 
he could easily convince Signor Buonafede, the father 
of the girl he loves, that there are people alive on the 
moon. Sure enough, Buonafede, played by senior 
vocal performance major Kevin O’Hora, gazes through 
Ecclitico’s telescope and witnesses what he thinks are 
people on the moon. In fact, Ecclitico’s students had 
been acting out a variety of bizarre scenes, including 
a woman getting dragged away by the nose, behind a 
screen. Buonafede is convinced, however, and sings a 
beautiful aria about how perfect life seems on the moon.
Ecclitico, decked out in vibrant astronomer garb, then 
sang an aria in which he planned to use Ernesto’s money 
to fund a plan to trick the Signor into letting his two 
daughters and maidservant marry. Ernesto was gracefully 
portrayed by master’s student in music Courtney 
Elvira. Ecclitico loves Clarice, Ernesto loves Flaminia, 
and Ernesto’s servant, Cecco, played by junior vocal 
performance major Camilo Estrada, is in love with the 
maidservant Lisetta. The women were charmingly played 
by junior vocal performance majors Samantha Kronenfeld, 
Rachel Doehring, and Shannyn Rinker, respectively. Later 
in their home, Signor Buonafede’s beautiful daughters 
sing a duet about how strict their father is. They resolve 
that though they will still have to answer to a man when 
married, marriage is preferable to the way they live 
presently. Doehring weighs the options in a humorous 
and drawn out way as Kronenfeld joins her in their duet. 
Ecclitico drugs Signor and, in a particularly wonderfully 
staged scene, has his students lift the Signor’s chair 
to convince him that he is ?ying to the moon. Signor 
Buonafede and Ecclitico sing a beautiful duet contrasting 
their desires.
The second act opened with a moon-like set. The men’s 
chorus, now dressed in bizarre costumes — one of the 
men was dressed as a pair of pants, another was on roller 
blades and looked like a shrub — pretended to be people 
of the moon. Stars were suspended from the ceiling as 
Signor Buonafede took in the majesty of the moon through 
song. Throughout the second act, Ecclitico, with the help 
of Cecco and Ernesto, tricked Signor Buonafede to let his 
daughters marry each man in turn. Cecco, playing the 
part of the emperor of the moon, rode in on a large golden 
duck chariot set-piece. Signor Buonafede’s 
hysterical realization that he had been duped included him 
running around the stage and picking up fake stars with a 
surprised expression.
Each actor displayed impressive vocal power and 
precision as well as comic timing, often turning to the 
audience to deliver a sidelong glance or a salty line. 
The set, designed by master’s student in scenic design 
Caitlin Ayer with assistance from junior design major 
Nathan Brown, not only ?t each scene of the show but 
allowed for funny interactions with the cast, including 
a cloud that doubled as a scooter, on which Signor 
Buonafede was pulled around a couple times.
The costumes, particularly during the second act, 
showed a huge amount of creativity on the part of 
master’s in costume design student Eunjin Lee. 
Ernesto’s costume on the moon even had stuffed animals 
on it, which various characters occasionally pet.
The show closed back on Earth with a celebration. The 
wonderful accompaniment by School of Music students 
in the pit orchestra under the direction of guest music 
director Christopher Larkin made the opera sound 
incredibly re?ned and put together. With beautiful 
sets and costumes and the indisputable vocal talent 
displayed by the cast, Haydn’s wonderful comic opera 
was given light and life that won’t soon be forgotten.

“Like my grandmothers, I refuse to be the ink that gives 
the white page a meaning,” wrote Allderdice High 
School senior Amma Ababio.
On the other side of the racial divide, “I sob because I 
can’t let the world treat everyone / as it will treat me,” 
wrote Pittsburgh Creative and Performing Arts School 
student Isaac Monroe in his second-place poem, “I Have 
it Hard (That’s a Lie).”
Creative writing senior Michael Mingo described 
clandestine racism in a homogeneous town in ?rst-place 
poem “Rural Vandalism.” In her second-place poem 
“To Lebanon,” junior psychology and French double 
major Siriana Abboud re?ected on the memory of her 
native country: “You, my land, have raised me.” In 
his third-place poem, ?rst-year creative and technical 
writing double major Joshua Brown wrangled with a 
different brand of difference and discrimination, writing, 
“When I was born, I came out swinging, / Prepared to 
beat back the savage stinging / Of this world’s brutal 
preoccupation / With my private passions.”
On Martin Luther King, Jr. Day, students, faculty, 
families, and community members convened in 
Rangos Ballroom for the Martin Luther King, Jr. Day 
Writing Awards, an annual event launched by Thomas 
Stockham Baker University Professor of English 
Jim Daniels in 1999, which encourages both local 
college and high school students to write about their 
experiences of racial discrimination or difference 
in memory of Dr. King, according to the call for 
submissions. First, second, and third place awards 
were given in four categories: college prose, high school 
prose, college poetry, and high school poetry.
Not only written word was featured at the ceremony: 
The event launched with powerful musical 
performances by students in the School of Drama, 
whose vocal talent, it seems, we so rarely get to hear. 
Their performances ranged from spirited to somber, 
from a pounding rendition of black spiritual anthem 
“Down by the Riverside” to a sobering spoken word 
poem that held the audience rapt: “This feels a lot like 
Selma,” the poem lamented about recent events in 
Ferguson and New York. “2015 feels like 1965.”
Following the performances, the winners commenced 
reading from their work, moving from college poetry 
to college prose categories. In third-place “Fair and 
Lovely,” junior psychology and creative writing double 
major Michelle Mathew spoke about discrimination 
against darker skin in her native India. In second-place 
“On Language,” ?rst-year undeclared Dietrich College 
student Ellie Liu described losing her native Mandarin 
and watching her mother’s “attempts at accent-
eradication.”
Junior chemistry and creative writing double major 
Sophie Zucker took to the podium last to read from her 
?rst place-winning essay, “The Washing.” Her hook, a 
description of a chemically extreme hair-straightening 
process called the Blowout — of which her mother is a 
devotee — seems, at surface level, unrelated to issues 
of race. The connection is subtle but signi?cant, and 
becomes more overt as the piece goes on.
“It’s about how hair is racialized,” Zucker said in 
an interview. “Straight hair is seen as professional 
and socially acceptable; curly hair is seen as deviant.” 
Because it’s associated with people of color, curly hair 
is construed as exotic and low class — prompting many 
black women to straighten, weave, or otherwise alter 
their hair, from a “desire to emulate whiteness.”
Zucker said she started researching the natural hair 
movement in earnest during her senior year of high 
school, when one of her friends decided to go natural — 
and when Zucker herself was “trying to write about my 
identity in a more nuanced way.” While simultaneously 
learning about antisemitism and modern-day Judaism, 
Zucker watched Chris Rock’s documentary Good Hair  
and read Malcolm X’s autobiographical descriptions of 
hair straightening in the African American community.
“ ‘We’re all just trying to look whiter,’ ” Zucker quoted 
her mother in her essay. “...‘Why do you think black 
women get weaves? Why do you think I straighten my 
hair? It’s not because it’s cheap or easy.’ ”
With the most emotionally resonant piece appropriately 
saved for last, ?rst-place high school prose winner 
Ababio took the stage. Though her voice was ?rm, 
Ababio apologized in advance for her emotional delivery, 
and told the audience about her incredible struggle 
being thrust into American racial beauty standards as a 
young Ghanaian immigrant.
Ababio choked and came to tears while reading from 
her work. “I was disgusted by the coarseness of my hair, 
the hand-me-down clothes I wore, and especially the 
color of my skin,” wrote Ababio, who resorted to harsh 
skin lightening formula and baby powder in an attempt 
to whiten her skin. At this point in the reading, Ababio 
paused in earnest distress.
“It’s okay, baby,” a woman called from the audience.
As Ababio left the podium to the loudest applause yet, 
Daniels took the mic to propose they end the night in 
song. A single School of Drama student came to the 
stage to sing from the black national anthem, a ringing 
rendition of “Lift Every Voice and Sing.” It was slowed 
and powerful for its lack of instrumental company, and 
after the last belted note hit the ceiling, a few moments 
passed before anyone spoke.

The Academy announced this year’s nominees on Jan. 
15, instantly provoking a slew of criticism. Some of it 
was the usual complaints about snubs — I, personally, 
think that The Lego Movie deserved a nomination for 
Best Animated Feature Film — but most focused on the 
fact that the nominees are dramatically whitewashed.
All of the nominees for Best Actor are white, including 
Bradley Cooper (American Sniper), Steve Carrell 
(Foxcatcher), Benedict Cumberbatch (The Imitation 
Game), Michael Keaton (Birdman), and Eddie Redmayne 
(The Theory of Everything). All of the nominated 
directors, with the exception of Birdman’s Alejandro 
G. Iñárritu, who is a native Mexican, are white males, 
leaving out Angelina Jolie (Unbroken) and Ava DuVernay 
(Selma), who would’ve made history as the ?rst African-
American woman nominated for Directing. A year after 
12 Years a Slave won Best Picture and right after Selma, 
a movie about Martin Luther King, Jr., was released, it’s 
disheartening to see such a lack of diversity.
While I can’t write about every movie, here, in order, are 
my top three picks for Best Picture:
Boyhood
Boyhood was notable right off the bat for its unique 
?lming technique: director Richard Linklater, instead of 
using different actors for the same character at different 
ages, ?lmed Boyhood over the course of 12 years, 
following the life of Mason (Ellar Coltrane) from age 5 
to 18. Boyhood was rightfully nominated for Directing, 
as well as Film Editing (Sandra Adair), Original 
Screenplay (Richard Linklater), Best Supporting Actor 
(Ethan Hawke), and Best Supporting Actress (Patricia 
Arquette). Although the ?lm’s star, Coltrane, wasn’t 
nominated for Best Actor, Arquette’s and Hawke’s 
nominations were well-deserved. Arquette played 
Mason’s mother, tough and loving through a string of 
broken, alcohol-soaked marriages. Boyhood’s long-term 
?lming is more than a gimmick — the movie is real in a 
way that movies rarely are.
The Imitation Game
The Imitation Game is about Alan Turing (Benedict 
Cumberbatch), a closeted genius who cracks the 
Germans’ enigma code during World War II and helps 
turn the tide in favor of the Allies. The ?lm secured 
an impressive list of nominations, including those 
for Directing (Morten Tyldum), Best Actor (Benedict 
Cumberbatch), Best Supporting Actress (Keira 
Knightley), Film Editing (William Goldenberg), Original 
Score (Alexandre Desplat), Adapted Screenplay (Graham 
Moore) and Production Design (Maria Djurkovic and 
Tatiana Macdonald). Although doubtlessly some of 
the history is smudged — would we expect any less of 
Hollywood? — The Imitation Game tells an important 
and emotional story, carrying the weight of Turing’s 
chemical castration and subsequent suicide when his 
homosexuality was discovered after the war. Benedict 
Cumberbatch was a good choice for Turing; he’s used to 
playing the aloof genius after his role in BBC’s Sherlock. 
In The Imitation Game Cumberbatch is more human 
than ever, although the ?lm’s Oscar-bait central quote 
(“Sometimes it is the people who no one imagines 
anything of who do the things that no one can imagine”) 
felt a little heavy-handed.
Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Innocence)
Birdman is just about as meta as it gets. In the movie, 
Riggan Thompson (Michael Keaton) plays a washed up 
actor famous for his role as Birdman (Keaton himself 
played Batman in 1989). Thompson tries to make 
himself relevant by writing, directing, and starring in 
a Broadway play based on Raymond Carver’s What 
We Talk About When We Talk about Love, ?ghting 
against an egocentric lead actor (Edward Norton), his 
daughter (Emma Stone), and his own mind. Birdman 
is one long camera shot, earning it a nomination for 
Cinematography (Emmanuel Lubezki), which it will 
surely win. Birdman was also nominated for Best Actor 
(Michael Keaton), Best Supporting Actor (Edward 
Norton), Best Supporting Actress (Emma Stone), Best 
Director (Alejandro G. Iñárritu), Best Sound Editing 
(Martin Hernández and Aaron Glascock), Best Sound 
Mixing (Jon Taylor, Frank A. Montaño and Thomas 
Varga), and Best Original Screenplay (Alejandro G. 
Iñárritu, Nicolás Giacobone, Alexander Dinelaris, Jr. & 
Armando Bo). Birdman offers a sobering commentary 
on show business and Hollywood alike, highlighted by 
Keaton and Stone’s standout performances.

Lula Beresford-Banker | Pillbox Editor
Boyhood is a drama chronicling one boy’s path to adulthood. The ?lm is notable 
for its unprecedented ?lming process   — ?lming the same actors intermittently over 
the course of twelve years. The result is a comprehensive examination of Mason 
Evans’ journey through the pains and joys of childhood and adolescence. Directed 
by Richard Linklater and a big favorite this award season, Boyhood is a must-see for 
those wishing to witness cinematic history.

Every so often, going on a trip is exactly what you need. 
Voyaging to a new place opens your eyes to the potential 
that the world holds and reminds you to embrace 
adventure once again.
There was a moment over winter break when I 
was standing at the Western Wall in the Old City of 
Jerusalem. I was surrounded by people of all ages, 
religions, and nationalities. We were all together in one 
moment, and it didn’t matter who was praying in what 
language, or if you were crying tears of joy or sorrow, or 
if you believed that there was someone receiving the 
prayer or not. There were differences, but they didn’t 
divide us. They made us stronger.
It was a poignant, dazzling moment, and it was when I 
realized that my trip to Israel was going to be more than 
just a vacation.
I was lucky enough to spend ten incredible days in 
Israel as a part of The David Project’s Israel Uncovered 
trip. The David Project is a young, fresh organization 
dedicated to taking campus leaders to discover their 
own Israel. There’s no dodging issues or questions. 
There’s no sugarcoating and no bias. It’s just 
straight-up information: tours of historical sights, talks 
from important people, and time set aside for you to 
explore by yourself so that you can draw the best, most 
comprehensive, informed opinion possible.
In the days preceding the trip, I struggled with how to 
prepare. Friends that had been on the trip previously 
told me that I was in for the trip of a lifetime. How do you 
get ready to experience a once-in-a-lifetime experience? 
Can you? I settled for simply skimming a few Wikipedia 
articles and Facebook stalking the other thirty students 
who were going to be on the trip. The more I read, the 
more I realized that there was no hope for me to learn all
 
of the necessary information in one week’s time. I was 
just going to have to go for it.
The trip itself was the most exhausting ten days I’ve 
experienced in my life, and I have never enjoyed 
anything more. From the moment we woke up in the 
morning until we ?nally stumbled to bed at 3 or 4 a.m., 
we were talking, learning, seeing, doing, experiencing, 
surprising, eating, drinking, hating, and loving. There 
was so much packed into every hour that it felt like every 
day was a year and a half. There’s no possible way to 
write about everything that happened or even all of the 
things we saw and felt: There’s simply too much.
From the modern, pulsing clubs that dot the city of Tel 
Aviv to the silent snowfall that blanketed the Holy City, 
every stop along the way was fraught with complexity 
and signi?cance. There was never a place where I felt 
nothing.
When we arrived in Tel Aviv, the sky was overcast and 
small raindrops were cautiously peppering the sidewalks 
and cars. I felt like I hadn’t even left Pittsburgh, until 
we started driving through the city to get to our hotel, 
which was a block away from the Mediterranean Sea. 
Israel is a worthy, stimulating destination
Ten day trip to the Middle East is an adventure that everyone should undertake in life
Tel Aviv has a bustling night life, even during the 
Shabbat, the Jewish day of rest. The city is known as 
the easy-going yet high energy opposite of Jerusalem.
                  Laura Scherb | Publisher
by Laura Scherb | Publisher[]
There were no more than a few cars driving around, 
and everything seemed quiet, as if life was on hold. It 
was early afternoon on Friday, and Shabbat, the Jewish 
day of rest, was beginning. We held our own traditional 
Shabbat service to welcome the Sabbath, as many 
families do not only in Israel, but across the world. From 
Friday night to Saturday evening, no work is done. Cars 
stay quiet, businesses close, and the streets are silent. 
But in Tel Aviv, which is generally acknowledged as 
Jerusalem’s hip, younger sibling of a city, Shabbat isn’t 
as strict. Sure, people still stay in and have a family 
dinner, but then they go out afterwards and celebrate 
in one of the millions of bars that lines the streets of the 
bouncing city. We joined them the ?rst night, ?ghting jet 
lag and a language barrier to start the nightlife off strong.
I ended up at a small bratwurst/beer shop with a few 
of the students on the trip, sipping our drinks as we 
watched the city stroll by. The rain had (mostly) cleared 
by then, so we decided to meander down to the beach 
to dip our toes into a new ocean. It wasn’t until I looked 
up at the full moon above the crashing waves of the 
Mediterranean that it hit me: I was in Israel. I was 
halfway around the world, and I was about to have 
the adventure of a lifetime. I wasn’t quite sure how to 
process all of that, so I pushed it to the back of my mind 
and jumped in the ocean. In case you were wondering, 
jeans do not take salt water well.
The next leg of the trip took us to a kibbutz in Northern 
Israel on the Sea of Galilee. I was expecting the North to 
be a lull between Tel Aviv and Jerusalem, but I couldn’t 
have been more wrong. Walking out into the beautiful 
mountains was like taking a trip to Narnia. Everything 
was green and lush and beautifully ancient. We saw 
temples that have been around for longer than most 
modern civilizations. We saw abandoned mine ?elds that 
overlooked Syria and watched a rainbow peek out from 
behind the clouds. There were cows laying the middle 
of the road, and it was as if no other human had ever 
stepped upon the grass but for the ones who had laid the 
mines.
It seemed impossible that there wasn’t peace in such a 
beautiful, quiet place. It was chilling to realize that the 
world was such a scary, fragile place, but then I looked 
around me at all of the people I was with and everyone 
I have the privilege of going to school with here at 
Carnegie Mellon, and I felt safer.
Next, we ascended into Jerusalem. As we were driving 
to Jerusalem, I saw little houses that looked just as old 
as the temples and columns of the Old City. It got me 
thinking how even though we were visiting all of the 
historical landmarks that are well known, there are 
little places around the world that contain so much 
history and signi?cance that we might not know about 
today. It was overwhelming to consider how sacred and 
important nearly every street and house could be.
The second day that we were there, Jerusalem got nearly 
four inches of snow, one of the largest snowfalls in recent 
history there. The next morning was our tour of the 
historical, holy sights in the city. To see them covered 
in snow was a breathtaking experience. I thought that 
the snow would be an inconvenience, but instead I was 
greeted with the purest beauty I have ever seen. I could 
barely look away from the gleaming sun re?ecting off 
of the snow to concentrate on internalizing the day’s 
itinerary. It was perfect.
All in all, my trip to Israel was a whirlwind of people, 
amazing sights, incredible food, and once-in-a-
lifetime experiences. It’s impossible to sum up in one 
conversation, let alone one article. I can’t point out 
my favorite thing that we saw or the most powerful 
experience I had there. I can only say that I wouldn’t 
trade it for the world, and that if you ever have the 
chance to see the Holy Land in person, to miss it would 
be a tragedy.

Change up your repetitive winter look 
Tips for staying comfy, warm, and fashion forward through the long Pittsburgh winter
Tired of repeating the same outfits? It’s about that 
time of year again when you feel as if you’ve been 
wearing the same sweater every day with the same 
pair of black leggings, and this pattern can quickly get 
boring. Though this might be the most comfortable 
option, there are other clothing items you can try out 
that are comfortable but still unique and stylish. Here 
are a couple of fashion trends for the winter to help you 
through the season.
One style I’ve been seeing in stores and on campus 
— and this is quite unexpected, since it’s generally 
considered unflattering — is the turtleneck or cowl neck 
sweater. These types of sweaters are not commonly 
worn by people our age, but as of late they’ve grown 
in popularity. The turtleneck sweaters that have 
appeared in clothing stores are different from tighter, 
less appealing sweaters. These are instead larger and 
chunkier, and could make for an interesting look with 
some leggings and boots. They are also mostly available 
in neutral colors and earth tones, which are flattering 
on most people. Not to mention, these sweaters will 
definitely provide an adequate level of comfort, allowing 
you to be simultaneously stylish and comfortable.
Speaking of comfort, this season seems to be centered 
on that theme, with soft pullovers styled like sweatshirts. 
These tops look like basic sweatshirts, making them 
slightly more difficult to style since people wearing 
them run the risk of looking as though they are not put 
together. However, I think these can look nice with a 
pair of dark blue jeans and short black boots. Since these 
sweatshirts tend to be available only in dull colors, I 
would throw a scarf in a jewel tone or with an interesting 
pattern on top.
A style that I’ve been seeing in stores often is the cutout-
shoulder look, which is exactly what it sounds like. 
Although this style has existed for quite a while now, it 
seems to have become even more popular lately. From 
sweaters to nice blouses, to even dresses, the cutout-
shoulder look appears in several types of clothing items. 
This, like the turtleneck or cowl neck sweater, is another 
way to take a simple outfit and make it unique. Instead 
of wearing the same plain old sweater that everyone else 
has in some type of variation, give the cutout-shoulder 
sweater a try in order to make a statement. These 
will look good with anything — jeans or leggings — 
depending on the length. In order to make the outfit look 
more feminine, I would put on a necklace to complete 
the look.
Stripes have seemingly been very trendy for the winter, 
as I’ve been seeing a lot of striped shirts and sweaters in 
stores. While this pattern never really goes out of style, 
It’s been showing a lot more often than I’m used to. What 
makes the stripe pattern so great is that it’s so versatile, 
but it still makes you look as if you put some effort into 
your outfit. Due to their versatility, I don’t have much 
advice on how to style stripes, since they can usually be 
worn with anything. I do, however, recommend that if 
you’re going to be wearing stripes, don’t the striped item 
of clothing with any other pattern, since mixing patterns 
doesn’t go well for anyone.
A trend that I’m still unsure about, though I’ve still 
been seeing it everywhere, is the cropped shirt style. 
I was used to seeing crop tops being worn over the 
summer, but something new to me was seeing cropped 
sweaters in stores. The idea of a cropped sweater seems 
unexpected, since cropping a sweater seems to defeat 
the purpose of a sweater. However, I think that pairing 
the cropped sweater with either high-waisted jeans or a 
high-waisted circle skirt and tights could make for a nice 
outfit. So if you think you’ve exhausted all your options 
for clothing, and are tired of the pieces in your closet, 
remember that just one of these statement pieces for this 
winter can create a new look.
