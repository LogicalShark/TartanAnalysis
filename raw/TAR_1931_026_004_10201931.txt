Seriously Speaking
A Column of World News Events 
By NATHAN MILLER
TOO FAR EAST IS WEST
The Manchurian crisis has has­
tily and momentarily thrown into 
high relief the machinery for the 
pacific settlement of international 
disputes which has been developed 
in the last few years. The League 
of Nations, the Kellogg Pact, the 
Nine-Power Treaty for the pres­
ervation of the peace in the Ori­
ent—all these “pieces of paper” 
stand under their baptismal fire.
Japan has very suddenly insti­
gated this vortex of diplomacy. 
Taking advantage of the profound 
economic and social discomfiture 
under which Europe suffers and 
the aggravated sluggishness of tire 
American economic scene, Japan 
has boldly, and apparently, by 
malice aforethought, stepped into 
Manchuria with her armed forces. 
I3v this coup she intends to con­
firm definitely the veiled suzerain­
ty she has actually claimed over 
thij Asiastic area for many years.
You can appreciate the plight 
Which forces her to this overt
deed. With a spawning popula­
tion shut into an arable area hard­
ly larger than the state of New 
York, she must seek an outlet for 
her people and a source of food 
supply and raw materials. Her 
“natural” area of expansion is in 
the Asiatic mainland. This migrat­
ing impulse born out of land 
hunger has always operated as 
one of the most telling forces in 
history and little can stay in its 
way. There is something brutally 
elemental about it that suggests 
the struggle for existence.
Of course, in this action, Japan 
has ridden roughshod over the 
Chinese susceptibilities as well as 
having killed some hundreds of 
the native population. But then, 
that is the usual course of im­
perialism—some Nicarauguans came 
to an untimely end, also, not so 
long ago under American fire. Our 
accepted doctrine of sway over the 
Carribcan area, and the Monroe 
Doctrine, in which we have con­
siderately taken Latin America un-

GLEE CLUB PLANS 
NEW ORCHESTRA
Under the direction of Professor 
Malcherek, faculty director, and 
Ronald C. Teare,- student director, 
the Men’s Glee Club has planned 
to introduce a new orchestra 
which will be affiliated with the 
Club. The orchestra will number 
26 instrumentalists, most of whom 
play several instruments. The mu­
sical repertoire can easily range 
from popular dance music to clas­
sical compositions.
The basic instrumentations will 
be as follows: Four violins, two
violos, two cellos, one string bass, 
piano, one flute, one oboe, one 
clarinet, one bassoon, three saxa- 
pliones, three trumpets, two trom­
bones, one tuba, two banjos, and 
percussion. With such a complete 
group, nothing should be outside 
the scope of the Men’s Glee Club.
“ANSWER BEFORE 
DARK” IS INITIAL 
PLAY OF YEAR
First Production of the Year 
is Rewritten By 
Author
As the first production of the 
school year the Department. of 
Drama will present in the Little 
Theater, College of Fine Arts, a 
revised version of "Answer Before 
Dark” by Mrs. Elizabeth M. Ver- 
morcken. The play under the di­
rection of Prof. E. W. Hickman 
will be produced for one week be­
ginning Friday, October 23.
"Answer Before Dark,” the dram­
atization of Airs. Vcrmorckcn’s 
¦novel by the same name, was pre­
sented in the Little Theater as the 
concluding production of, last semes­
ter. In an interview with Mrs. Vcr- 
morcken, she said that after reading 
the many, criticisms of the play, she 
set, about revising it at the begin­
ning of the summer. She rewrote 
It according to the criticisms given, 
keeping in mind the opinion of 
each critic. But as what seemed 
weaknesses to some were virtues to 
others and the criticisms eventually 
erased each other, Mrs. Vermorckcn 
found it very difficult to satisfy all 
at the same time. When she took 
up the play again early this fall she 
decided merely to take advantage 
of her own fresh return to her 
characters and plot, as she said she 
had “paid too 1 much attention to 
criticism.” She rewrote the play 
with an eye to securing earlier 
movement of the acts. Having 
seen the rehearsals, Mrs. Vcr- 
morckcn is greatly pleased with the 
result.
. The story which first appeared 
over a year ago, revolve *'.';. . Mii,dra 
girl of considerable talent, who 
wished to become an artist. Many 
of the scenes arc set in and around 
Pittsburgh, taking in the Golf Club 
in /Sellcnley Park and the Carnegie 
Museum.
Mrs. Vermorckcn who uses her 
maiden name, Elizabeth Moorhead, 
as her nom de plume was for 17 
years an associate professor of 
English Literature at Carnegie. 
Sincc her resignation three years 
ago, she has taken up writing as a 
profession, a field in which she has 
always been keenly interested.

Student Council Accepts 
New System of Voting
At a meeting Tuesday, Oc­
tober 13, the Student Council I 
adopted the plurality system' 
of voting for all Carnegie elec­
tions. Under the plurality 
system the voters choo'sc one 
candidate. The person receiv­
ing the highest individual 
number of votes is eicctcd, 
and in» case of a vacancy the 
candidate receiving the next 
highest number of votes suc.- 
cccds to office. By the old 
preferential system the voter 
chosc three candidates from 
the ballot and indicated his 
order of choice. This system 
made the counting of votes 
very complicated as the sec­
ond and third choices of each 
candidate were weighed along 
with the first.
This new system will make 
elections much simpler, and 
at the sanifc time will eliminate 
re-elections.

Brings All Dances Except 
Junior Proms Back 
to Campus
ECONOMni MOTIVE
School Affairs to Be Held 
in New Union in 
Gymnasium
lh^cre will be no favors at any 
;of the Carnegie danccs to be held 
this year, and the assessment for 
all danccs will be set at a minimum 
according to a recommendation 
passed by Student Council.
Members of Council also votcdj 
to hold danccs, formal or informal, 
in the new Union, now in process 
of construction, excepting the Men's 
Junior Prom and the Women's 
Junior Prom.
These resolutions arc in line with1 
other economy measures that have 
been passed in Council this year. 
Expensive favors have been chiefly 
responsible for the almost pro­
hibitive cost of tickets to many oE 
these functions. In fact, a survey 
shows, the cost of suitable favors’ 
has made up a large percentage of: 
budgets for these social affairs in) 
the past. In some cases this per-* 
ccntagc has been as high as a' 
fifth or a fourth of the total.
Consequently, with the elimina­
tion of this large item, it is hoped 
that assessments for the various- 
danccs may he considerably lower­
ed. The . s/uuc consideration gov-r 
erncd Council’s resolution regard««

very much larger that that of th«

Cut Hockey Catches Eye of Carnegie 
Engineers, Plumbers, Co-Eds and Plebes^
42 Out of S3 Co-Eds and 
All Males on Cut 
Watch Sport
Eighty-three per cent of the femi­
nine college students and 100 per 
cent of the masculine college stu­
dents arc interested in hockey as 
Carnegie co-eds play it on the Cut.
Of tiie 251 Carnegie students that 
passed over the Cut in one hour 
during an afternoon session of 
hockey, 208 registered visible mani­
festations of amusement, and a few 
seemed actually intrigued by this 
fascinating game. Eighty-three per 
cent, or 42 out of 53, of the femi­
nine students gave a share of their 
attention to the game as they 
walked past, while not a single 
masculine student failed either to 
twist the head, spread a smile, or 
come to a dead stop. In order to 
accredit this perfect score to the 
engineering, industries, and mascu­
line art students, two lion-responsive 
professors were placed in a class by 
themselves in the final statistics.
Approximately 12 per cent of the
passcrsby, principally males, were 
interested enough to stop and fol­
low the progress of the game* 
Dozens of plebcs, a group of metal­
lurgical engineers, a n d several 
plumbers from Industries, were 
among those who detained them­
selves. None of the janitors, who 
happened to be homeward bound 
at the time of the survey, actually 
camc to a stop, although they gave 
indications of being highly enter­
tained.
One conclusion of the survey 
was that feminine hockey is a game 
of "00 per cent inspiration and 1 
per cent perspiration.” As a col­
lection of the spontaneous remarks 
made by passcrsby was also com­
piled, the reader may draw his own 
conclusion from a few samples: 
"Holy Moses, arc they tough I” 
“Oh umpire, that blondy’s off 
size.”
“I'd like to be umpire.”
“Here boys, you’ll get sore eyes." 
—Faculty member remark.
“Oh, what a smack I"
“Just like we used to play in the 
alley!"

Hockey, under the direction of 
the new manager, Alice Thompson, 
has started. There is a very large' 
turn-out of enthusiastic players. 
Practices' arc held at 3:30.and 4:30 
o’clock every day on the Cut. Those

HETHER THE PURDUE BOILERMAKERS 
will be able to get up enough steam this week 
to push their gridiron machine across the Tar­tan goal line the necessary number of times is 
one of those questions that will "hang fire” 
until the referee blows a halt to the battle next Saturday. Wisconsin, in their 21-14 victory 
over Purdue, scored three touchdowns in the 
first quarter, so it seems that the highly touted 
line of the Riveters will yield against the 
proper pressure.Although this is the first appearance of a Purdue team in 
these parts of Pennsylvania, Steffen’s men will not be confronted 
with a new style of play. The Boilermakers’ coaching staff con­
sists of Noble Kizcr, Mai Elward, and Frank Carideo, who at . one time or other, were notorious athletes on the gridirons of 
Notre Dame. The Rockne system is thoroughly installed in the 
Indiana team, and the Tartans must be on their toes to keep 
the visitors under control.A passing combination of Heckcr to Moss has demonstrated 
thus far that Purdue’s aerial attack is by no means meager. Captain “Ookic Miller, center, and halfbacks White and Risk, 
All-Conference selections last year, will do much to uphold the 
football dignity of the Middle West next Saturday.It appears that the greater part of Purdue University will 
congregate in the Stadium at game time. A large delegation of Alumni will be on hand to greet the squad of eighty-four grid- 
ders who will warm the bench for old Purdue.

PLEBES AND PANTHER FRESHMEN brought back 
memories of the ancient days when the banks of the Bowl were 
lined with spectators who watched the Skibo football teams push 
the pigskin about on the Carnegie campus. The rain-soaked field 
was the only cause of the scoreless tie. Great differences are 
minimized under these conditions, and the opportunity for 
fumbles limits the play to drab line plunges.
¦ The whistle at the end of the first half saved the Pitt 
yeaVlings from making a possible touchdown, but the Plebes 
pushed the play into the visitor’s territory during the greater 
part of the second half. Several sure scores Were averted by 
the hard tackling of the Panther linemen who brought on'costly 
fumbles behind the Skibo line.
Coach Allison's squad of husky freshmen will re-tie the 
traditional knot with the West Virginia freshmen at Morgan? 
’'town next Saturday. The Plebes should pull the trick if they 
puff‘forth their usual good brand of ball playing,)« * »< X<
COACH GUY I-IALFERTY’S HARRIERS of the varsity

quality of the freshmen will be tested against the Peabody High School runners on Friday afternoon. This meet marks the 
opening of the fall campaign, the varsity performing four times on the home grounds followed by a trip to New York to meet

SKIBO PLEBES,

PLAY TIE GAME
Rain Covers Players With 
Mud Rather Than 
Glory
On a field covered with mud, the 
Pitt Frosh and the Carnegie Tecli 
Plebes biittlcd to a scoreless tie Iasi 
Saturday ¡morning in, the! Tartan 
Bowl. A steady rain fell throughout 
most of'the contest soaking the field, 
the ball, and the players, making 
accurate handling of the oval im­
possible.
Each team had several chances to 
score but neither could take ad­
vantage of their opportunities. The 
Tartan yearlings showed the most 
power, scoring Iwo first downs to 
their opponents one, and gaining; 
considerably yardage on several other 
occasions.
Pitt Miss’ Chance to Score
In the first half the Pitt frosh 
lhissed a good chance to score. They 
recovered a fumble on the Skibo s 
twenty-five yard mark. In four plays 
they ripped off thirteen yards. But 
there the 'Carnegie plebes defense 
strengthened. In three downs limy 
held their opponents to five yards 
and' it was f.ptirlh down and five 
yards and goal to go wli.cn the half 
ended.
Tartans Gain Advantage
Most of the second half was play­
ed in Pitt territory. Midway through 
the third period the Panther kicker 
failed to get off a punt due to a bad 
pass' from the center and the Tar­
tans, took the ball on downs. Mihm, 
Carnegie fullback, on several plunges 
gained a first down on the enemy’s 
eleven yard lind. It ¡yoked to be the 
golden opportunity for the Skibo 
Freshmen but on the next play a 
fumble was recovered by Pitt who 
kicked out of danger..Once more the 
Plaid player started a drive which 
looked as if it would bring ahcut a 
score but on third down with t 
scant two yards to go for first down, 
tile ball was fumbled and again re­
covered by Pitt. The game- ended 
with the ball still in Pitt’? territory.
Mihm Shows Well
Joe Mihm was the most «con- 
sistant ground gainer in the game. 
The Panther yearlings had a hard 
time stopping the burly fullback. 
Moscrip and Anderson played a banir 
up game in the line, frequently break­
ing through and • getting the Pitt 
hacks before they could get started. 
Plummer played well but wai in­
jured in the second quarter.
WOMEN’S ATHLETICS
The Women’s Athletic Associa­
tion is planning a Play Day for 
high school girls, which will be 
held October 24 on the Cut from 
nine in the morning until one 
o'clock. Thirty-three schools in the 
vicinity have been invited to par­
ticipate, and each is sending five 
representatives. There will be no 
competition between schools, but 
the girls will be assigned to differ­
ent color teams. The idea of the 
Play Day is "play for play’s sake.”
Gloria Kloos is the general chair­
man in charge. Those assisting 
here arc: invitations, Mary Jane 
Gray; challenges, Lois McGregor; 
color teams, Betty Prellor; decora­
tions, Esther Freni; advertising, 
Elizabeth Lilley; , and luncheon, 
Atilma Blessing. Some of the team 
captains arc Alice Thompson, Hazel 
Gough, Genevieve Rose, and Gene 
Ritzcl. The fscorers arc: Betty
Prellcr, Leah Vocgtly, Helen Smith, 
Maybcllc Steele, Martha Burry and 
Bernice Converse.
Basketball, baseball, volleyball, 
archery, and hockey will be played 
by the different color teams for 
two periods. After each. period 
there will be a rest hour to enable 
the girls to do their best in each 
sport. Challenging will be held the 
third period, during which time any 
girl may ask another participant 
to jump rope, play jacks, stand on 
her head, or any stunt that she 
herself can perform herself. The 
winner thus obtains a point for 
her team. Following this, there 
will be a relay race and then swim­
ming. At one o’clock a luncheon 
will be served in the Car.i’gic Inn 
for all the delegates.
The high school students have 
manifested much enthusiasm over 
the Play Day) and the physical 
education instructors are experienc­
ing much difficulty in choosing the 
best representatives of lli.eir schools. 
These representatives are chosen 
not only for their athletic ability 
but also for their sportsmanship and 
interest in the event. As this is 
tlic first Play Day of its kind which 
has, been1 sponsored at Carnegie by' 
the Women’s Athletic Association, 
all arc giving it their loyal support 
in order to insure the expèctcd suc­
cess.

glance at all times how much ink is in the pen. The Norac is also available with all-opaque barrel if so desired. And because there is 
no rubber sac within the barrel, 
the ink capacity of the Nozac is 
35% greater than other pens of the same size. Crash the nearest 
up-to-date supply depot and get _acquainted with "the pen that winds like a watch." The price is timely—$6 and $10; pencils to match $3.50 and $5.00. Other Conklins—new shapes—

it. Y’kncnv, about ' the middle of 
the sccond year, and cvcpy year 
thereafter, everyone dccidds it’s an 
awful mess, but we always comc 
back for more, so it can’t be so 
bad after all. In fact, after ana­
lyzing the whole situation, most 
of us find that the friendship we 
have formed and the nights spent 
on the campus have, held more for 
us than we realized on the face 
of it, and then we feel that the
iirst , year is the hardest;, after
that we like it more than we care 
to admit. So, let’s continue to
keep . the air of good fellowship 
that exists at present, and above 
all, support the Council in its at­
tempts to bring the men of the
three colleges closer .together, for, 
while the night men have done big 
things Already,, it is only by co­
operation with everyone that the 
Council’s affairs can prosper. And 
the Councils of the past have left 
a fine record behind them; a num­
ber of traditions that belong to 
the night school alone; and it’s up 
to the students, both the ncw- 
comers and the veterans, to keep 
these traditions and these records 
on their‘proper pinnacle. We have 
one of the finest night organiza­
tions in the country, and it will 
ccrtainly be a shame if we don’t

get together and make this year 
bigger and better than ever.,
It’s up to the older students to 
interest the new men in the cam­
pus affairs, so if. you won’t work 
yourself, at least don’t make any 
disparaging remarks that will em­
barrass or discourage the new 
men who are doing the job that 
you should have had • enough 
school spirit to tackle. McG.
College JewelryPennantsSeal StationeryC. M. STAUFTIn spite of the depression, the 
present low cost of butter and 
eggs, the recent shakcup of the
G. P. U., etc., etc., etc., it has
again become - evident that you 
cannot convince night students 
that their place is at the Interna­
tional Wailing Wall and not on
the campus. It is truly shocking 
to find that so many of us have 
developed such a hard outer shell 
from constant association with, ex­
aminations, .professors and home­
work, that we Have completely
forgotten the material side of af­
fairs in our mad scramble to get 
a place in the registration lines.
All that aside, it seems great to 
find that the majority of the night 
students who w;ere among those 
present last year have returned 
to the campuS again, and their
ranks arc well reinforced by goodly 
numbers of new men who have 
profited by the example of the
upperclassmen. During the sum­
mer, it was a common occurrence 
to meet a fellow student who was 
afraid he would be unable to 
scrape the necessary evil together 
to cover his tuition, but it seems 
that most of them made the
grade, for there arc but few of 
the old faces missing in most of 
the departments.
It is certainly pathetic when a 
night student, whose time is. much 
more valuable to him because of 
the length of his course than It 
would be to a day student, is forc­
ed to hold back and .lose a year
becaitse of lack of funds. It is
really a case of necessity in most 
instances, and our sympathy ccr­
tainly goes out to the boys who 
were forced to check.
However, there is no reason to 
lose heart,, for times arc bound
to improve, and the rest ccrtainly 
won’t do the unwilling vacation­
ist any harm. You’ll be back next 
year with fire in' your eye, ready 
to cat up everything the faculty 
car. muster. And, as far as the 
lost time goes, it need not be a 
total loss, for. a lot of reading 
along the lines most beneficial to 
the student in preparation for the. 
coming work will ease things 
greatly and enable him to pay 
more attention to the details of a 
course than a man who gets de­
tails, generalities, and all the rest 
of it at one long bite.

to sec everyone who has returned

Well, I thought that the registra­
tion time' was set for October 6, 7 
and S, but did I get a surprise on 
the twelfth night? And how. I 
thought I had to get in this line 
ulso. Looked as if the whole school 
was re-registering., Line forms on the 
left. Bet the cashier’s office did a 
rushing business. I said line, but I 
should have said lines as there were 
many and they all were heading to 
jhe registrating end of Administra­
tion Hall. Out of curibsit'y, I should 
like to know how many registered 
on this night—bet 800 or so.
Just inside the door of Ihc build­
ing was our good old friencj Man- 
son. Still holding the portals strong. 
Nothing' gets past him. His familiar 
"Where to, young man?" was wel­
comed music to my cars. And he is 
ilill the same courteous watchman as 
of yore. Time has dcalth gently with 
him, and he is ever ready to help 
you out when you are looking for 
some hidden place on the campus. 
My advice to the new students is— 
if you can’t ¦find a room, just look 
Mr. Manson up and he zvill set you 
right.
Yes, we have, a distinctive building 
on the campus in the Machinery Hall, 
and it is made more so by the tower 
which rises to the sk'^es. On the first 
aiight of school this tower blazed 
iorth with a glow of light all its 
»wn. Sure did make a glorious sight 
lo behold. Pitt has its cathedral 
tower—a distinctive mark on their 
campus—and we, have our tower 
belching forth a glare indicating ani­
mation. Why can’t we have this effect 
every night? It would become dis­
tinctive of Carnegie and would be 
B torch to training and education in 
Pittsburgh. This is an idea, and I 
hope it will be carricd out. The cost 
;of keeping the - lights glowing every 
school night would- not be much and 
.would go far in placing Carnegie on 
¡the sky. Pitt has a red star burning 
every night on top of the cathedral 
so let’s have, our torch light the way 
¡to knowledge at Carnegie.
Other things besides cars get 
tagged, judging from the tags one 
sees" in' the hall and corridors of the 
various buildings. Somebody didn’t 
obey instructions. It’s just as I 
thought. Some of the fclloius just 
'got q lock and proceeded to padlock 
ihc first loeker they came to. It didn’t 
work. Rules arc rules and if you 
don’t obey them, you’ll just have to 
suffer the consequence. The rcgula- 
lions are that you are to purchase a 
Jock if you never had one before 
and get an assignment from the 
locker key room and then go to 
this locker and no other. If you had 
a lock from previous years, all you 
had to do is get an assignment and 
then take that locker. We’ll all learn 
some day.
Well the first week of ' school is 
about over and I am wondering how 
all the new students found things at 
Carnegie. As for myself, having 
spent last year on the campus I 
have become somewhat of an old 
student, but not as old as some of 
those who have spent ten, eleven, 
twelve, thirteen or fourteen years 
out here.

With the Plebes 
Plebe regulations seem to have declined to a Tues­
day noon inspection, but perhaps, it is just as well. 
The first Engineering Trial with Judge
at bat is to be commended for its choice of sentences 
which were about the right'mixture of severity and 
ludicrousness. The dorm boys ,take a much keener 
interest in devising unique games for the Freshmen 
but their harshness has declined considerably since 
the horrible days of ’28. In one of the dorms, after 
a chastisement has, been administered, the prisoner 
snaps to attention, salutes briskly, and remarks, “Hot 
stuff! Who fired ; that shot?” . . . This rule’about 
Freshmen speaking to everyone with a cheery “liello” 
should be assumed by the Plebes as an important re­
sponsibility to make the campus more friendly. In 
small colleges where everyone knows Everyone else 
the spirit is natural, but here if the Plebes don’t foster 
the spirit no one else will. Let’s go, Plebes! Hello 
There!”
Silver Linings
This bloomin’ depression has its good features after 
all. The severity of the financial situation has 
brought about several long needed changes. Cutting 
out favors at dances is a very sensible and economic 
step because no really worthwhile favors have ever 
been given (ostrich fans, pcrfuinists, letter openers, 
and such trash). Keeping the dances on the campus 
cuts the cost of the dances' and of transportation and 
to boot makes them seem more like school affairs. 
Of course the new “Ballroom” makes this step pos­
sible. Fraternity rushing season cut in half, hooray!
Another Football Dance

Doctor and Missues Neelley who were having a 
VERY big time. Here’s to more faculty members

checking service . . . The congestion of couples on 
the Birch Hall Heights steps . . . The swell half 
moon . . 7 Hittin’ the hay, and ah, what a life! . . .
Improvements
To make everything connected with the new “Ball­
room” shipshape the school has replaced the rough 
concrete sidewalk beside the Gym. How about the 
walk . along Forbes between Beeler and ' Woodlawn? 
The many cavities in the pavement make a wet 
weather trip across the stretch chiefly a game of 
dodging puddles aiid 
then finally giv­
ing up in disgust 
and wading thru 
them all. Most of 
the dorm girls have 
to make the trip 
at least four - times 
a day so just im­
agine the number 
of wet feet. While
they are at it they might as well widen the walk 
from Margaret Morrison to the Inn because people 
are always crowded off onto the mud plot beside the 
curb. The new steps to Birch Hall Heights should 
be 'completed soon before the old ones pull a "One 
Hoss Shay” stunt.

No one can condone the action 
of the Japanese \n openly flouting 
their pledges and commitments 
under the Kellogg Act and the 
duties of their -membership in the 
League of Nations. Whether they 
can be forced by international ac­
tion to back down from armed ac­
tion remains to be seen. If they 
can, then a great victory will have 
been won for the pacific solution 
of international “episodes” which 
would have ripened into war un­

its influence into the balance in 
order to preserve 1 the status quo.

This throws our international

because we arc trying to act with

Rushing Season
The Intcrfratcrnity Council is vto be congratulated on 
its prompt action in revising the period of rushing season 
for this year. Reducing the time limit to one week, estab­lishing regulations to limit the number of social functions, 
and not permitting any rushing activities off the campus, 
arc moves that should aid the fraternities considerably in 
their present financial situation.The approval of the Faculty Committee must also be obtained to sanction the proposed changes. There is every 
indication that this approval will be secured as the faculty 
arc to be credited with originally instigating the movement 
for the revision.
This College Spirit
Carnegie’s football team recently received a real com­pliment, in a sports column by one .of the less prejudiced 
writers in the city papers. L. J. Biedcrman remarked in 
his column that when it comes to real college spirit, Car­
negie’s team is second tp no other team in the country.It is this same spirit' that has been responsible for the 
marked success of our football teams in recent years. The 
ability to present a fighting team whether the odds are for 
or, against Carnegie indicates greater success than mere 
victories.That the students thcmsclyes can gleam this spirit was 
evidenced at Georgia, Tech last week. At the conclusion of the first Carnegie touchdown, wlien the home team was re­
turning up the field, tlie band struck up their familiar school 
song and every student was on his feet cheering their team 1 
as though Carnegie’s score had never occurred.Carnegie rooters would do well to take heed to this 
lesson in real college spirit for a loyal backing will ease the 
sting of any defeat, and more often turn defeat into a vic­
tory.
Parking Problems
• For both day and night students traffic difficulties on 
Carnegie’s; campus are becoming . increasingly .acute and per­plexing . to. those wHo trayql Mby .automobile. Despite the 
fact that . there is. an. obvious . scarcity of parking spaces 
at all hours of the day, and that the Carnegie campus har­
bors, three of the most hazardous corners in Pittsburgh, no 
permanent remedial solutions are in sight....... The improvement of the grounds- bet-ween Machinery
Hall and Engineering ITall, where parking space for approx­
imately 100 cars will' be'provided, will .offer only a tem­
porary relief for the parking problem. Although the utiliza­
tion of a portion of the huge ball field between Woodlawn Avenue and Forbes Street for parking sites has been 
deemed inadvisable, this, may be a feasible solution since 
the field is of ample- size to be used for both parking, and 
recreational purposes certainly the Accessibility of these two lots together would minimize our present parking difficulties.
The intersection of Frew Street and Woodlawn Ave­
nue at the entrance to the Margaret Morrison College, the Park Boulevard connection near- • the Gymnasium, and the 
curve at the lower end of the College of Industries are three 
dangerous corners. With respect to these the school asks the co-operation of the students on the following points, which 
will- be strictly enforced, henceforth, by Pittsburgh traffic officers on the campus:
1. Park no cars around the red light at the entrance to the Margaret Morrison College, nor on any part of that curve.
2. Be positive that your car is within parking lines 
along . Woodlawn Avenue and Frew Street at the Park Boulevard intersection.
3. Do not speed around the curve at the lower end of 
tlie College of Industries near the Schenley Bridge, for there is great danger of side-swiping a parked autoobile just around the curve.
4. Park on only one side of that section of Woodlawn Avenue which is parallel to the College of Industries.
5. No parking is permitted inside the red light at the entrance to the Administration Hall.
6. Do not park on curves in Schenley Park.
A few constructive suggestions might be added to these. Park your, car as close to the adjacent , one as possible so 
as to conserve parking space. The co-operation of those 
students who use automobiles will reduce to a minimum our present parking and traffic problems. G.
