The Tepper School of Busi-
ness may be expanding in 
the not-so-distant future. On 
Sept. 23, an undergraduate 
student town hall meeting 
was held to discuss prelimi-
nary plans for a new, larger 
building on campus devoted 
to the school.
Consultants from Bright-
spot Strategy, led by founder 
Elliot Felix, delivered a pre-
sentation in Posner Hall’s Mel-
lon Auditorium that aimed to 
get input and reactions from 
students about the company’s 
design requirements brief 
draft for the new building.
According to a written de-
sign brief draft from Bright-
spot, “In 2010, the Tepper 
School engaged the architec-
ture ?rm Kohn Pedersen Fox 
(KPF) to plan for its expan-
sion and relocation, including 
selecting a site on the More-
wood lot across Forbes Ave-
nue as well as determining an 
initial program of spaces and 
building massing concept.”
Three years later, this col-
laboration with Brightspot 
is continuing with an update 
to KPF’s work by creating a 
“future design that quanti?es 
and relates the components 
of the building.” The docu-
ment and Felix’s presentation 
suggest that there have been 
various complaints about the 
present facilities used by Tep-
per, including that Posner 
Hall does not create an ideal 
or convivial atmosphere for 
students; that there is little 
“?exibility to accommodate 
change;” and that there is not 
enough space designated to 
the school in terms of class-
rooms, communal areas, and 
larger spaces for events.

Many CulinArt employees 
stepped out from behind the 
cash registers of Entropy+ 
and Carnegie Mellon’s campus 
eateries onto the sidewalk of 
Forbes Avenue to hand out ?y-
ers asking for increased wages 
last Wednesday.
Since the university’s con-
tract with CulinArt Inc. ex-
pired on June 30, 32BJ Ser-
vice Employees International 
Union (SEIU) — the union 
representing Carnegie Mel-
lon’s service workers — has 
been ?ghting to increase the 
wages of it members at Carn-
egie Mellon.
CulinArt employees at 
Carnegie Mellon currently 
earn $10.30 per hour, which is 
$3.05 over the minimum wage 
in Pennsylvania. 
Workers have been com-
plaining that although the 
price of the meal plan has in-
creased by 37 percent in the 
past decade, the revenue has 
not been passed onto the em-
ployees.
According to 32BJ SEIU 
calculations, the average 
Carnegie Mellon CulinArt em-
ployee gets paid $21,424 per 
year. 
Director of 32BJ SEIU Her-
maine Delaney reported that 
Carnegie Mellon CulinArt em-
ployees get paid less than food 
service workers at Duquesne 
University and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
The union believes that 
CulinArt employees are not 
being paid wages comparable 
to their skill sets, which in-
clude learning how to cook, 
avoid cross-contamination, be 
aware of food safety zones and 
food temperatures, and learn 
how to accommodate to vari-
ous dietary needs.
32BJ SEIU ?eld representa-
tive Peter Schmidt comment-
ed, “In some fast food places, 
service workers are making 
as much as $15 per hour, and 
most of the skills learned by 
CulinArt employees are not 
required there at all. Workers 
here are providing a very spe-
ci?c skill sets and should be 
compensated ?nancially for 
that.”
Schmidt added, “One of 
the things we are trying to 
accomplish with our union 
membership is to make sure 
that everybody has one good 
job that they can rely on with-
out having to work a second 
or third job. So that they’ll 
have time to go back to school 
if they want to, spend time 
with their families, live a nor-
mal life instead of constantly 
working.”
Due to the nature of work-
ing at a university, many 
CulinArt employees are laid 
off for holiday breaks.
Vashawn Davis, a CulinArt 
employee, said, “It de?nitely 
makes it harder, the [school] 
work schedule. Some people 
have to apply for unemploy-
ment every summer, and you 
have to keep re-?ling for un-
employment every two weeks. 
Some workers have to spend 
up the money they worked so 
hard to save during the year 
just to get by during the sum-
mers.”
Davis clocks in 40 hours 
a week through his 7 p.m. 
to 3:30 a.m. shifts. After his 
shift ends at 3:30 a.m., Davis, 
whose primary form of trans-
portation is the bus, waits 
around in the UC until 5:30 
a.m., when the buses start 
running, so that he can return 
home.
“Whenever I get off work 
in the mornings, I sit down-
stairs and watch T.V. until 
5:30 when I can take the bus. I 
won’t get back to my home un-
til 6 a.m., which is about the 
time everyone else is waking 
up,” Davis said.
“Bus passes are $100 per 
month, but if I had more mon-
ey, I would try to get a car,” he 
added.
Right now, 32BJ SEIU is in 
talks with CulinArt to negoti-
ate a new contract that could 
potentially offer its Carnegie 
Mellon employees better wag-
es for the next four years. 
In the past, Carnegie Mel-
lon and its previous food ser-
vice company Parkhurst, were 
able to negotiate agreeable 
wages.
This year, through ?yers, 
CulinArt employees and 32BJ 
SEIU hope to raise awareness 
among students about in-
creasing their wages.
“Our goal is that we want 
people to understand that 
the folks who cook the meals 
and have these personal rela-
tionships with the students, 
they’re also real people who 
have real lives too,” Schmidt 
said.
“They’re trying to keep up 
with the rising costs of every-
thing that students have to 
deal with — the gas, the rent, 
groceries, bills,” he added.
“Support from students 
and the university is an effec-
tive thing. For the workers, it 
is helpful being able to know 
that the people who they work 
for actually appreciate what 
they do,” Delaney said.
Senior economic and sta-
tistics major Bernard Yuan 
commented on the situation, 
lobbying for raising the wages 
of CulinArt employees. 
“The backbone of your 
business is your workers, and 
if you can’t satisfy your work-
ers, you don’t have a strong 
backbone, and you’re not go-
ing to have a quality business,” 
he said. 
 “If the workers are not 
happy, I feel like management 
should do something about 
it because if the workers are 
satis?ed, they will ultimately 
be more ef?cient and deliver 
more quality service. So I’d be 
okay if they raised the wages,” 
Yuan continued.

Last year, Carnegie 
Mellon alumna Sarah 
Peko-Spicer and director of 
undergraduate economics 
Carol Goldburg began to pi-
lot a new chapter of Money-
think, an organization that 
serves underprivileged high 
school students.
Carnegie Mellon’s stu-
dent-run Moneythink chap-
ter seeks to prepare inner-
city high school students for 
post-secondary education 
and ?nancial management.
The chapter will be ac-
cepting fall membership ap-
plications until Wednesday; 
membership is open to both 
undergraduate and gradu-
ate students.
Sophomore statistics 
and economics major Anu-
sha Kukreja, sophomore 
statistics and economics 
major Jillian Ward, and 
sophomore international 
relations and politics major 
Satvika Neti will lead the 
chapter in fall 2013.
Once accepted candi-
dates are noti?ed, mentors 
will travel to Pittsburgh 
schools once a week to pro-
vide in-class instruction. 
The chapter has already 
formed partnerships with 
Northside Urban Pathways 
Charter School and West-
inghouse High School.
“In the CMU chapter, we 
have over 200 students that 
have expressed interest.... 
It’s amazing to see CMU 
becoming just as passion-
ate about Moneythink as we 
are,” Ward said.
The establishment of a 
Moneythink chapter pres-
ents the Carnegie Mellon 
community with an op-
portunity to become part 
of a fast-growing force for 
change.
Moneythink’s mission 
has received nationwide 
recognition, and as a re-
sult, a number of nationally 
recognized organizations 
and corporations expressed 
interest in developing rela-
tionships with Moneythink 
members.
The national Money-
think team is working to 
establish employment pipe-
lines for Moneythink men-
tors at corporations includ-
ing J.P. Morgan and Chase.
“These employment 
pipelines are set up via part-
nerships with the corpo-

Recently, a group of Carn-
egie Mellon professors pe-
titioned the Pittsburgh City 
Council to change parking 
rates along Margaret Morri-
son Street, Tech Street, Frew 
Street, and Schenley Drive.
The rate for parking on 
Schenley Drive and Marga-
ret Morrison Street is now 50 
cents per hour, down from the 
previous $2 per hour. On Frew 
and Tech streets, the rate is 
now $2.25 per hour, a slight 
increase from the previous 
$2 per hour. The changes in 
parking rates will be accom-
panied by new signage that 
designates Margaret Morrison 
Street and Schenley Drive as 
“Economy Parking” and Tech 
Street and Frew Street as “Pre-
mium Parking.”
The project that led to the 
change in parking rates was 
headed by professor of eco-
nomics Stephen Spear and 
associate professor of organi-
zational behavior and theory 
Mark Fichman. According to 
Fichman, the change in park-
ing rates is intended to facili-
tate the ideal parking usage 
for maximum revenue and 
convenience for students and 
professors alike.
“It just seemed like things 
were not working right, and 
we thought we know how it 
could be done better, and the 
city council was supportive of 
this idea,” Fichman said.
After parking rates on 
Margaret Morrison and other 
nearby streets increased last 
year, there was a surge in ap-
plications for on-campus park-
ing, according to Fichman. 
This generated a long waitlist, 
while much of the street park-
ing around campus remained 
largely empty.
Fichman considers the 
ideal utilization of the af-
fected parking spaces to be 80

Recently, Jonathan Cagan 
— the George Tallman and 
Florence Barrett professor of 
engineering and co-director 
of the Master of Product De-
velopment program — was 
appointed the director of in-
novation and entrepreneur-
ship for the College of Engi-
neering.
“I am quite excited about 
leading new activities that 
bridge engineers to other 
disciplines on campus and 
to promote entrepreneur-
ial and innovation activities 
and education,” Cagan said 
in a university press release. 
“Carnegie Mellon has a long 
history of innovation in re-
search and strong success in 
commercialization of these 
successes. There is an oppor-
tunity within the College of 
Engineering to more explic-
itly teach students the skills 
necessary to succeed in prod-
uct, technology, and service 
innovation, and the ability 
to develop new businesses 
around those innovations. I 
also look forward to explor-
ing more synergies with our 
Silicon Valley campus, and 
leverage the Silicon Valley 
environment to promote new 
innovation potential.”
Cagan has written four 
books about product devel-
opment and holds several 
patents addressing computa-
tional design and products. 
Cagan is also a fellow of the 
American Society of Me-
chanical Engineers and has 
received numerous awards, 
including seven Best Paper 
awards and at premier engi-
neering design research con-
ferences, the 2007 College 
of Engineering Outstanding

puter Science. “Although 
the two prize winners were 
selected independently, 
they both have made major 
contributions to the ?eld of 
computer graphics. Their 
work has yielded many ben-
e?ts, ranging from more 
realistic animation for Hol-
lywood movies to improved 
modeling and visualization 
of real-world systems and 
new approaches to high-per-
formance computing.”
James, an associate pro-
fessor of computer science 
at Cornell and former as-
sistant professor of com-
puter science and robotics 
at Carnegie Mellon, will re-
ceive the Katayanagi Emerg-
ing Leadership Prize and a

in these companies.” Kukre-
ja said.
In addition, Moneythink 
recently established an 
alumni board, which has be-
come a fast-growing intern-
ship resource for current 
mentors, and recently de-
veloped a partnership with 
Teach for America (TFA), 
according to Kukreja.
“The TFA partnership 
means that we are working 
closely with TFA teachers 
on a national level to get 
into more classrooms. It also 
means that our mentors are 
a selective pool of individu-
als being recruited by TFA. 
TFA values our mentors and 
is very interested in having 
them apply,” she said.
Other bene?ts for mem-
bers include discounts at 
local businesses, as well as 
free or discounted packages 
for courses through organi-
zations such as Kaplan and 
Wall Street Prep. Though a 
recent organization, Mon-
eythink has already made 
lasting impacts. The orga-
nization was honored by 
President Obama in March 
as “a campus champion of 
change,” along with four 
other student organizations.
Kukreja, who attended 
the annual Moneythink 
Leadership Conference 
this summer, learned that 
through Moneythink cours-
es, one student was able to 
use budgeting tactics to en-
able his family to keep the 
heat on through the winter, 
while another was able to 
save enough to buy his sis-
ter reading glasses so she 
could stop struggling to see 
the board and start keeping 
pace in her classes.
Though the organization 
has started by reaching out 
to high-need, low-income 
groups, it ultimately aims 
for a much larger scope.
“In talking to others, 
we’ve found that no mat-
ter the background, most 
high school students are not 
well informed about how 
to make and manage their 
money,” Kukreja said. “Mon-
eythink’s mission is to make 
a ?nancial literacy course 
mandatory for high school 
graduation by 2030.”
“We have a vision for 
Moneythink here at CMU, 
and the best part of joining 
now is getting to shape that 
vision, and graduate CMU 
leaving a legacy of the chap-
ter and the impact it has in 
our city,” Ward said.
Moneythink members 
develop a curriculum and 
then travel to inner-city 
high schools once a week as 
“mentors” to teach the cur-
riculum to students. 
The organization origi-
nated at the University of 
Chicago, and has chapters 
at 30 universities across 10 
states. In the spring of 2012, 
Family Services of Pennsyl-
vania (FSWP) approached 
the Tepper School of Busi-
ness to propose a partner-
ship in creating a Money-
think chapter.
Following the FSWP vis-
it, Goldburg attended the 
2012 Moneythink Leader-
ship Conference and initi-
ated collaboration between 
FSWP and Carnegie Mellon 
economics students. FWSP 
brought members into con-
tact with Pittsburgh public 
schools, and Peko-Spicer be-
gan going into classrooms as 
a Moneythink mentor.
“I loved the idea of giving 
back to the community [and 
I was] committed to found-
ing the CMU Moneythink 
chapter,” Peko-Spicer said.
“We were all immensely 
excited upon hearing about 
the program,” Kukreja said 
via email. “Within a week, 
we were the three co-pres-
idents of the CMU chapter, 
and it’s been an incredible 
journey, especially this sum-
mer, to see us work as a team 
to develop the chapter.”
brief draft states the new 
Tepper building will be located 
near Hamburg Hall, in the area 
next to Forbes currently used 
as Morewood Gardens park-
ing lot. The future building is 
envisioned as being part of the 
“new generation” of Carnegie 
Mellon, with other buildings 
also expected to be built in the 
area.
Felix and Brightspot envi-
sion, with the advice of stu-
dents and faculty, a new build-
ing that showcases a pride in 
Tepper and its entrepreneurial 
initiatives.
“It will be a game changer,” 
Felix said. Another focus 
brought up during the town 
hall meeting was that the new 
Tepper should be “inclusive of 
undergraduates.” A complaint 
brought up by students was 
the divide between the under-
graduate and graduate busi-
ness cultures.
Students also mentioned 
how currently, Tepper stu-
dents are forced to have classes 
and business club meetings in 
other buildings such as Wean 
Hall, because Posner does not 
have enough rooms to accom-
modate its business popula-
tion. “The hope is that we can 
accommodate many under-
graduate business or econom-
ics classes,” Felix said.
There are currently prelimi-
nary plans on the layout of the 
building. Felix stated it might 
be as high as eight stories, with 
a lobby and a public area on 
the ?rst ?oor. The ?oors would 
progressively get more private 
the higher they go, with the 
eighth ?oor containing faculty 
and Ph.D. work space. It’s un-
decided if a corridor (similar 
to those in Wean Hall) or suite 
structure (similar to those in 
Warner Hall) will be used for 
faculty of?ce spaces. There 
are plans to incorporate vari-
ous types of rooms, such as 
“breakout rooms” that have 
eight seats, Wi-Fi connection, 
and whiteboards on two walls; 
?at, ?exible classrooms with 
60 seats; and auditoriums 
with more modern seating 
arrangements.
The plan is to have two din-
ing spaces, one possibly a cof-
fee shop and the other a meal-
oriented area. There were 
other ideas tossed around, in-
cluding having a library space, 
lounges for students, research 
centers, a ?tness area, a book 
store, study spaces, and even 
a space devoted to entrepre-
neurs; feedback is needed for 
many of the plans.
Hue Tran, a sophomore 
business administration ma-
jor who attended the event, 
is enthusiastic about the new 
building. “Well, I am most ex-
cited about the fact that there 
will be many more rooms de-
signed for students to practice 
and brainstorm for various 
events like case competition 
and class presentation,” Tran 
said. “This will signi?cantly 
improve their performance 
since it is much easier for them 
to practice now. The extra 
space from the new building 
[would] also make students 
want to stay there longer, cre-
ating a stronger sense of Tep-
per community.”

An unprecdented number 
of students from the Carn-
egie Mellon Rwanda (CMU-R) 
campus have been successfully 
landing big corporate intern-
ships recently.
According to a university 
press release, 23 of the Rwan-
da campus students spent last 
summer interning at compa-
nies such as IBM, Visa, Micro-
soft, and Marriott. The Carn-
egie Mellon Rwanda website 
also shows that students were 
offered internships at com-
panies such as MTN Group, 
Citrix, Husk Power Systems, 
and MFS Africa.
CMU-R welcomed its ?rst 
class of 40 students in 2012. 
The campus is offering a mas-
ter of science degree in infor-
mation technology, which ac-
cording to the of?cial website 
is “a multidisciplinary curricu-
lum that strikes a ?ne balance 
between technology, business, 
and innovation, preparing the 
next generation of IT leaders 
in East Africa.”
They will also begin offer-
ing a master of science in elec-
trical and computer engineer-
ing “that provides students 
with an opportunity for in-
depth specialization in aspects 
of the ?eld” next year.
Michel Bézy, associate di-
rector of CMU-R and distin-
guished service professor of 
engineering and public policy, 
helped organize the internship 
efforts.
“It wasn’t easy,” Bézy said. 
“There’s no culture of intern-
ships in Africa.”
Bézy went on to explain 
that “companies generally 
don’t pay anything or have a 
prepared program.... With our 
students, we want them to do 
a real job. Not only that we 
want them to be paid a seri-
ous salary,” Bézy said, adding 
that some made $2,000 in a 
summer, which is greater than 
Rwanda’s per-capita GDP.
Kevin Rudahinduka is a stu-
dent in the master of science in 
information technology pro-
gram at CMU-R and recently 
completed an internship with 
Visa. Rudahinduka said in a 
university press release, “Every 
CMU-R student should aspire 
to have an internship in a For-
tune 500 company because it is 
the best, eye-opening, world-
class experience I have ever re-
ceived, and it has inspired my 
dreams of tomorrow.”
Bézy explained, “for many 
of them it was their ?rst time 
out of Rwanda. For some, it 
was their ?rst time on an air-
plane.”
The students were well 
received by their employers, 
with Bézy recalling that “some 
of the students received offers 
for a job from the company 
they worked for.”
Bruce Krogh, director of 
the CMU-R campus and pro-
fessor of electrical and com-
puter engineering added on 
to that idea. “The students are 
remarkable in spirit, ambition, 
and doing what it takes to be in 
the program,” Krogh said.
But running the Rwandan 
program is not easy.
“Every day has had chal-
lenges on all sorts of fronts,” 
Krogh said. “The govern-
ment of Rwanda is support-
ing Rwandan students. Our 
$40,000 tuition is obviously 
astronomical to African stu-
dents. So it’s dif?cult to get 
non-Rwandan students.”
The opening of a Carnegie 
Mellon campus in Rwanda 
generated some controversy 
when ?rst announced. Rwan-
dan President Paul Kagame 
visited Carnegie Mellon’s Pitts-
burgh campus as part of the 
announcement, and was met 
with protests by students who 
objected to his administra-
tion’s restrictions on the press.
Former University Presi-
dent Jared Cohon remarked at 
the time that “Carnegie Mel-
lon sees as part of its mission 
not only becoming a global 
university, but having global 
impact. Africa is a part of the 
world that really is in desper-
ate need of higher education 
resources.”
“Our agreement [with the 
Rwandan government] says 
that we’re entirely in control 
of hiring, admissions, and aca-
demics,” Krogh said. He added 
that Rwanda is “a total outlier 
in Africa” in terms of ?ghting 
corruption, saying, “Even the 
critics agree that Rwanda says 
what it’s going to do.”
“We’re very interested in 
letting students know they 
could come spend a semester 
in Kigali.... Kigali is just as safe 
as Pittsburgh,” Krogh said.
Bézy spoke of the intern-
ship program, saying that it 
“was very good for our visibil-
ity.... We are not here only to 
deliver master’s degrees. We 
want to be integrated into the 
economic development of this 
region.”
percent. 
“That’s our goal. If it goes 
above 80, we raise the price 
to bring it back to 80; if it 
goes below 80 we lower the 
price until it gets back up to 
80.”
Fichman cited SFpark, 
a project used to improve 
parking in San Francisco, as 
an inspiration for the plan 
to change parking rates at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
Fichman also credits as-
sistant professor of opera-
tions research and public 
policy at Heinz College Rob-
ert Hampshire for the idea.
According to SFpark’s 
website, the project 
“collect[s] and distribute[s] 
real-time information about 
where parking is available 
so drivers can quickly ?nd 
open spaces. To help achieve 
the right level of parking 
availability, SFpark periodi-
cally adjusts meter and ga-
rage pricing up and down 
to match demand. Demand-
responsive pricing encour-
ages drivers to park in unde-
rused areas and garages.”
The rationalization be-
hind the price adjustments 
at Carnegie Mellon was 
similar, Fichman said. “On 
a monthly basis we use 
data from the city. The city 
parking authority gives us 
a ?le with 20 to 30 thou-
sand parking occasions — so 
where you parked and for 
how long — and we use that 
data to determine whether 
the capacity’s underutilized 
or overutilized and then 
send the parking authority a 
note saying we’d like to keep 
parking prices the way they 
are, or we’d like to change 
them in the following way. 
Then they make the changes, 
we see what happens, and so 
it continues.”
“If rates are too low, 
parking availability will be 
scarce, with low turnover 
throughout the business 
day. This creates a competi-
tion among commuters for 
parking spaces early in the 
day and presents real chal-
lenges throughout the day 
for individuals who need 
to park for an hour or two 
in order to attend a class, 
meeting or even make a de-
livery,” said Spear in a uni-
versity press release.
“Rates that are too high 
will cause all drivers to 
avoid using these parking 
areas, which underutilizes a 
resource and ultimately low-
ers revenue.”
Becca Wol?nger, a soph-
omore electrical and com-
puter engineering major 
who likes to park on or near 
campus, echoed Spear’s sen-
timents. “It’s bene?cial to 
the school to have the park-
ing spaces closer to campus 
lower in price; it makes it 
much easier for professors 
and students who live far 
from campus to get there 
and ?nd somewhere to 
park.”
Fichman hopes that in 
the future Carnegie Mellon 
can adjust the parking rates 
for the parking garage and 
other parking lots on cam-
pus to re?ect utilization of 
nearby street parking.
According to Fichman, 
the project seems to be 
working so far. 
“The parking author-
ity is, I think, feeling pretty 
good about what we’ve 
done. I think from their 
point of view they’re getting 
more revenue, and we’re 
establishing the idea that 
parking pricing can be man-
aged in a way that is bene?-
cial for everyone,” she said.

Imagine a future in which 
you could get in your car, en-
ter your destination in a GPS, 
and sit back and relax as your 
vehicle transports you without 
so much as your ?nger on the 
wheel. Well, there’s no need to 
imagine — that day is already 
here. A 15-member team at 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
consisting of faculty, full-time 
research staff, post-doctoral 
researchers, and graduate 
students worked with General 
Motors (GM) to develop an 
autonomous driving car that 
can navigate through the ev-
eryday traf?c of the roads of 
Pittsburgh just as well as — if 
not better than — any human 
driver.
Carnegie Mellon has been 
working in the ?eld of autono-
mous vehicles since 1986. Raj 
Rajkumar, a professor in the 
department of electrical and 
computer engineering and 
co-director of the Gen-
eral Motors-
Carnegie  
Mellon Autonomous Driv-
ing Collaborative Research 
Lab, became involved in 
2006. “There was a competi-
tion called the 2007 DARPA 
[Defense Advanced Research 
Projects Agency] Urban Chal-
lenge,” Rajkumar said. “The 
competition they had was ba-
sically making vehicles that 
can drive themselves in an 
urban-like setting through a 
60-mile course in less than six 
hours.” 
On race day, only six teams 
successfully completed the 
course, with Carnegie Mellon 
in ?rst place for a $2 million 
prize. “This competition made 
us realize that automated driv-
ing vehicles are no longer sci-
ence ?ction,” Rajkumar said.
GM was Carnegie Mel-
lon’s biggest sponsor for the 
competition. After Carnegie 
Mellon’s ?rst-place win, GM 
decided to invest more in the 
project and started the Gen-
eral Motors-Carnegie Mellon 
Autonomous Driving Col-
laborative Research Lab on 
campus. The lab continued 
to work on the vehicle from 
the competition, which was a 
2007 Chevy Tahoe; this huge 
SUV was completely ?lled 
with electronics and looked 
nothing like an ordinary car. 
“There were about 20 sensors 
all hanging around the car, 
and a huge cylinder on top,” 
Rajkumar said.
However, in 2011 the 
group bought a Cadillac SRX, 
a crossover SUV, right from 
the dealer’s lot here in Pitts-
burgh. Rajkumar explained 
that the car was developed us-
ing three subsystems. The ?rst 
was the sensors: “These are 
radars, cameras, and lasers, 
which basically sense what is 
around the vehicle in terms 
of obstacles, other vehicles, 
pedestrians, and bicyclists,” 
Rajkumar said.
The second subsystem is 
made up of computers that 
grab this information from the 
sensors, process it, and fuse it 
all together. This is the com-
ponent that determines the 
location of objects, the speed 
at which they are moving, and 
their direction.
“The third subsystem is 
called the actuators, 
which basically ap-
plies the brakes, 
sends gas 
to the engine, shifts the trans-
mission, puts on turn signals, 
and turns hazard lights on,” he 
said. This new-and-improved 
automated vehicle looks like 
any car you would ?nd on the 
road, both on the exterior and 
the interior.
The main bene?t to a driv-
erless vehicle — and one of 
the motivations for its inven-
tion — is that they can po-
tentially decrease the amount 
of vehicular crashes, most of 
which are caused by human 
error. “Humans are extremely 
smart but can be rather stupid 
as well,” Rajkumar said in a 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette article. 
“We can be distracted, angry, 
mad, sleepy, drunk, driving 
while eating, shaving, apply-
ing makeup, and even chang-
ing clothes. If we can take the 
basic human emotional and 
physical problems out of the 
equation, we expect injuries 
and fatalities will go down.”
However, there are also 
some downsides to an au-
tomated driving car 
that the team is still  
work-
ing on improving. For exam-
ple, the car lacks the intuition 
and experience that a human 
being would possess. When it 
brakes at stop signs or traf?c 
lights, the action seems abrupt 
when compared to the way 
a human driver would slow 
down gradually. 
The car is also unable to 
characterize the objects it sees 
the way a person would. The 
autonomous car has 360-de-
gree coverage, and while hu-
mans cannot see past their 
peripheral vision, the autono-
mous car can only recognize 
an object as a person, and 
can’t differentiate between a 
child or an older person. It can 
see signs, but it cannot neces-
sarily read them all. There is 
also the  
 
 
 
possibility of sensors failing.
Nevertheless, the future of 
vehicles has changed with the 
success of Carnegie Mellon’s 
and GM’s autonomous car. 
“The technology [for commer-
cially sold autonomous cars] 
will be ready by 2020,” Raj-
kumar said. “But then there is 
also social acceptance, regula-
tions to put in place, insurance 
liabilities, and so on, which 
will take a bit longer.”
Currently, the target price 
for such a car would be be-
tween $5,000–$7,000 in ad-
dition to the cost of the car 
itself. “So for $5,000–$7,000, 
you would basically have your 
own chauffeur to drive you 
around!” Rajkumar said.
Once a fantasy, self-driving cars are close to reality
Scientists rede?ne how the brain learns information
RAGHUNANDAN  AVULA

At Carnegie Mellon, stu-
dents often ?nd themselves 
spending long nights cram-
ming for tests. Hours of star-
ing at a book can lead to 
headaches and sometimes 
frustration as to why some-
thing just doesn’t make sense. 
Clouded by this frustration, 
many students can sometimes 
forget the incredible ability of 
the human brain; it constantly 
rewires the massive network 
of nerves to ensure that by the 
test, the student has mastered 
the concept at hand.
Scientists have been in-
trigued by how the brain 
works for years, and with ev-
ery day they understand more 
about what makes thinking, 
learning, and memory pos-
sible. Sandra J. Kuhlman, as-
sistant professor of biological 
sciences at Carnegie Mellon, 
explored how inhibitory neu-
rons in the brain function dur-
ing critical periods of learning. 
Kuhlman collaborated with 
researchers at the University 
of California, Los Angeles and 
University of California, Ir-
vine; their results were pub-
lished in the journal Nature.
The neural network can be 
pictured as a massive system 
of roads, with thousands of 
delivery trucks carrying mes-
sages from one part of the 
brain to another. These net-
works are made up of neurons, 
nerve cells that transmit elec-
tric signals across the cell and 
release chemicals that gener-
ate electrical stimulation of 
neighboring cells. The propa-
gation of these electric signals 
around the brain is vital to the 
brain’s function.
Roads are often connect-
ed at intersections governed 
by traf?c lights that control 
the movement of cars. In the 
brain, the neural network is 
constantly being modi?ed by 
excitatory neurons that act as 
green lights, allowing for the 
generation of electrical signals 
and thus the ?ow of informa-
tion from one cell to another. 
Conversely, inhibitory neu-
rons act as red lights, prevent-
ing the propagation of electri-
cal signals. 
Kuhlman and her team 
wanted to observe the work-
ings of inhibitory neurons 
during times of heightened 
learning by exposing mice to 
new events and stimulating a 
model for learning. However, 
80 percent of neuron cells 
are excitatory, which posed 
a challenge to the project. “If 
you’re just going blindly and 
observe cells, you are going 
to learn about excitatory cells 
because that’s what you will 
bump into,” Kuhlman said. 
Such ubiquity makes it dif?-
cult to learn about the speci?c 
neurons they were interested 
in.
However, the development 
of new technologies enabled 
the study to label different 
parts of the mouse brain us-
ing dyes. Kuhlman’s team uti-
lized this, along with powerful 
microscopes, to identify the 
inhibitory neurons and used 
electrodes to measure active 
electrical stimulations.
Prior to their experiment, 
the typical line of thinking was 
that inhibitory neurons release 
the chemical neurotransmit-
ter gamma-Aminobutyric acid 
(GABA); it had been hypothe-
sized that increased GABA en-
abled the brain to learn things 
quickly. The researchers, how-
ever, chose to investigate this 
theory.
After teaming with col-
laborators at UC Irvine, Kuhl-
man explained that the new 
ideas brought forth by the new 
members of the team ques-
tioned the theory about GABA, 
which propelled the team for-
ward. After the experiments, 
the team learned that when a 
person has a new experience, 
inhibition is reduced and less 
GABA is produced. This leads 
to the remodeling of circuits in 
the brain.
Kuhlman found it interest-
ing that “this was only seen in 
young brains. Older brains can 
also learn but the inhibition 
is removed differently and is 
harder to invoke.” The next 
step of her research may be to 
understand how the mecha-
nism works in older brains.
The project challenged a 
paradigm and changed the way 
scientists understand the role 
of inhibitory neurons in these 
critical periods of learning.

At a school that requires 
students to spend many late 
nights working, it’s not un-
common to hear a phrase 
similar to, “I am so addicted to 
caffeine! It’s awful.” Accord-
ing to U.S. News & World Re-
port, caffeine is a daily ritual 
for roughly 90 percent of the 
American population. It is nat-
urally found in chocolate, cof-
fee, and tea, and is added to 
sodas, energy drinks, and cer-
tain diet pills and medications. 
Though we are accustomed to 
having caffeine in our daily di-
ets, it is technically classi?ed 
as a psychoactive stimulant — 
it alters the chemistry of the 
brain, and affects our bodies in 
more ways than we may know.
Once caffeine enters the 
body, it is absorbed by the 
small intestine and enters the 
bloodstream. Since it can dis-
solve in both water and fat-
based substances, it can pass 
through the blood-brain bar-
rier to enter the brain, accord-
ing to howstuffworks.com. 
The brain naturally con-
tains the chemical adenosine 
— which is responsible for 
making us feel tired — and 
norepinephrine, a stimulant. 
When unaffected by caffeine, 
the brain has a certain amount 
of receptors for each of these 
chemicals to bind to in order 
to maintain the body’s normal 
cycle of lethargy and alertness.
Caffeine alters the activity 
of these receptors, largely be-
cause of its close resemblance 
to adenosine. Once caffeine 
enters the brain, it is recog-
nized by brain receptors as 
adenosine, and is able to bind 
to the adenosine receptors. 
Through this process, caffeine 
essentially stops adenosine 
from locking into the brain’s 
receptors and slows down 
nerve cell activity. In turn, the 
sudden increase in brain activ-
ity triggers the adrenal glands 
to produce more adrenaline. 
As a result, caffeine produces 
a feeling of alertness that 
usually lasts from four to six 
hours — until the caffeine 
is metabolized. After long-
term exposure to caffeine, the 
brain increases production 
of adenosine, and decreases 
production of the stimulant 
norepinephrine to maintain 
equilibrium with the caffeine 
intake. Caffeine’s ability to 
alter the brain’s chemical pro-
duction is the root cause of 
both its adverse and bene?cial 
effects on the body.
Because caffeine blocks ad-
enosine from binding to recep-
tors and slowing down nerve 
activity, it hinders the body 
from going into deep sleep, ac-
cording to Smithsonian Maga-
zine. Long-term use causes a 
cycle of sleep deprivation. The 
lack of deep sleep, combined 
with decreased production of 
norepinephrine, causes the 
body to become increasingly 
dependent on caffeine to re-
main alert. Therefore, regu-
lar caffeine consumers begin 
to experience withdrawal 
symptoms after 12–24 hours 
without consumption. Com-
mon withdrawal symptoms 
include fatigue, headache, dif-
?culty focusing, and depres-
sion. Though consuming two 
to four cups of caffeine per day 
is generally considered harm-
less, research has shown that 
people are likely to build up 
a tolerance for caffeine after 
two weeks to one month of 
consuming it regularly. Fortu-
nately, in most cases, caffeine 
addiction is not dif?cult to 
overcome. After seven to 12 
days without caffeine intake, 
the brain’s production of ad-
enosine and norepinephrine 
return to their base levels.
The effects of caffeine 
are not entirely detrimental. 
Because caffeine blocks ad-
enosine from binding to its 
receptors, it reduces the risk 
of developing Parkinson’s dis-
ease and is currently being 
researched as a treatment op-
tion. 
In addition, caffeine natu-
rally contains antioxidants 
and can therefore reduce the 
risk of contracting diseases 
such as liver cancer, colon can-
cer, and diabetes. It can also 
treat migraines by constricting 
the brain’s blood vessels. Aside 
from medical bene?ts, certain 
studies show that adults con-
suming the equivalent of caf-
feine in one cup of coffee were 
better able to perform prob-
lem solving tasks. 
HOW THINGS WORK
CMU’s drug of choice: How caffeine affects the brain
ROHAN VARMA

Imagine you’re sick. What 
if your doctor told you that 
the only way to cure your sick-
ness was by injecting you with 
millions of viruses? This treat-
ment could be a reality in the 
next decade, with the grow-
ing re-emergence of bacterio-
phage research and medical 
therapy.
Named from the Latin root 
“phage,” which means “to 
eat,” bacteriophages — also 
called phages — are viruses 
that systematically infect and 
kill bacteria. While they were 
discovered and used to treat 
previously incurable infec-
tions in the’20s and ’30s, they 
were abandoned as a remedy 
after the discovery of antibiot-
ics in the ’40s. However, with 
increasingly pervasive antibi-
otic-resistant bacteria, doc-
tors throughout the world are 
reviving old bacteriophage 
practices.
Each phage targets a spe-
ci?c strand of bacteria to use 
as a host. After identifying 
an accommodating host, the 
phage injects its genetic ma-
terial into the bacterial cell, 
hijacks the machinery of the 
cell, and converts it into a 
phage production factory. In 
this way, the phage helps it-
self by reproducing and helps 
humans by eliminating the 
targeted bacteria.
With the emerging ?eld, 
faculty at Carnegie Mellon 
partnered with the Howard 
Hughes Medical Institute to 
offer the Phage Genomics Re-
search course to undergradu-
ate ?rst-years from the Mellon 
College of Science. With the 
overarching vision of learning 
more about bacteriophages, 
the Howard Hughes Medical 
Institute is working with al-
most 90 other universities to 
put on this course.
The course exposes stu-
dents to research by sending 
them on a phage hunt. Stu-
dents have the opportunity to 
?nd their own unique phage, 
sequence its genetic material, 
name it anything they would 
like, and publish their phage 
to a growing database of bac-
teriophage species. Because 
phages exist everywhere in 
the world, students collect 
a sample of soil from their 
hometown and bring it with 
them to Carnegie Mellon. Af-
ter isolating the phage from 
the soil through experimen-
tal techniques, students use 
computational methods to 
sequence its genetic material.
“We are the only institu-
tion, of the 87 schools that of-
fer this program, that has our 
students sequence the DNA 
of the phages,” said Maggie 
Braun, one of the course’s 
teachers and Carnegie Mel-
lon’s assistant head for under-
graduate affairs at the Mellon 
College of Science.
After naming and publish-
ing their results, the students 
have an opportunity to par-
take in a group project where 
they can explore and research 
any aspect of the phage they 
wish.
“The biggest thing that 
I see students get out of the 
course is making connections 
between what they heard 
about in their classes and ac-
tually putting those things to 
use in a lab,” Braun said.
The research course goes 
beyond introducing students 
to lab work. Phage research 
has enormous potential in 
the ?eld of medicine. Jenni-
fer Huang, a ?rst-year biol-
ogy major currently taking 
the course, said, “The phage 
course is very exciting be-
cause it exposes us to research 
in an emerging ?eld that has 
intriguing questions yet to be 
answered.”
There are hundreds of 
thousands of phage species 
still to be found, and every 
additional phage adds to the 
growing body of research. Ac-
cording to Braun, every stu-
dent that takes the class has 
discovered their own unique 
phage.
Though each student’s 
work might seem insigni?cant 
on the grand scale, people 
one day might be treated and 
cured by a phage analyzed by 
a student at Carnegie Mellon.
Phage course provides ?rst-years with hands-on research
Dolphins and bats may have similar gene evolution
Scientists have recently 
discovered a set of genes in 
bottlenose dolphins and some 
bats that may contribute to 
their shared ability of echo-
location. The study was led 
by evolutionary geneticist 
Joe Parker from Queen Mary 
University of London. The 
researchers analyzed the ge-
nomes of 22 mammals, which 
included animals that could 
and could not echolocate. A 
computer then analyzed the 
genomes and compared the 
mutations that contribute to 
echolocation. The results in-
dicated that almost 200 ge-
netic regions across the spe-
cies had evolved together.
However, some colleagues 
question the results. “The 
authors are not really being 
cognizant of the limitations 
of their methods,” said David 
Pollock of the University of 
Colorado School of Medicine.

Video game shown to sharpen brains in older people
A report published in the

playing the racing video 
game NeuroRacer improves 
the mental acuity of elderly 
participants. The study was

The game has participants 
drive a car along a narrow 
and winding path. Through-
out the game, distracting 
signs pop up on the screen. 
Older patients were initially 
much worse at the game than 
their younger counterparts. 
However, after playing for 
12 hours over the course of a 
month they were able to beat 
20-year-olds playing it for the 
?rst time. Laboratory tests re-
vealed that the older partici-
pants also had an increased 
working memory and atten-
tion span.

Researchers give access to quantum computing
Users will soon be able to 
access quantum computing 
using their own computers. 
Those interested in running 
quantum algorithms on their 
own devices will be able to log 
in and access a two-qubit chip 
that is connected to the Inter-
net. Quantum computers run 
on qubits, which differ from 
typical bits in that they can be 
zero and one simultaneously, 
rather than sequentially. Re-
searchers theorize that qu-
bits will allow for much faster 
computation. The qubit chip 
is being provided by the Uni-
versity of Bristol in the United 
Kingdom.
Quantum computers have 
previously only been avail-
able to a select few academ-
ics and laboratories such as 
NASA. Researchers from Bris-
tol stressed the need for in-
creased public access to quan-
tum computing.

After a summer of public debate 
and discussion, Pennsylvania legis-
lators have again failed to privatize 
liquor stores.
Liquor sales in Pennsylvania are 
governed by the Pennsylvania Liquor 
Control Board (PLCB), a prohibition-
era government agency that grants, 
renews, and validates all liquor li-
censes in the state. In a USA Today 
column, Matthew Brouillette, found-
er of the Commonwealth Founda-
tion, recalled a remark by former 
Pennsylvania Governor Gifford 
Pinchot after the PLCB’s creation in 
1933. Pinchot stated that the pur-
pose of the PLCB is to “discourage 
the purchase of alcoholic beverages 
by making it as inconvenient and ex-
pensive as possible.”
Such tight control of Pennsyl-
vania’s alcohol market is no longer 
necessary. Pennsylvania and Utah 
are the only two remaining states 
that maintain full state control over 
liquor sales and distribution. It is for 
this reason that alcohol is conspicu-
ously missing from convenience 
stores, and there is an extremely rare 
and limited sale of beer and wine in 
grocery stores or other stores not cer-
ti?ed by the PLCB.
This summer saw a resurgence of 
the movement to end state control 
of alcohol, with legislators debating 
the issue and submitting privatiza-
tion proposals, according to the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette.
A recent editorial in the Post-
Gazette, stated that 61 percent of 
Pennsylvanians support the measure 
to privatize liquor; however, by the 
conclusion of the summer legislative 
session, legislators did not pass any 
bill on the matter.
Liquor privatization would allow 
a greater number of liquor stores, 
expanded hours of alcohol sales, and 
cheaper prices — all due to greater 
competition. Increased competition 
would most likely expand the liquor 
sector, lead to more jobs, and pro-
duce greater tax revenue. Addition-
ally, it would give people the option 
to buy beer, wine, and hard liquors 
in the same stores; right now, people 
do not have this option since beer 
distributors are licensed separately.
It is time for Pennsylvania to join 
the majority of America in allowing 
liquor stores to function in an un-
constrained free market. It is only 
through this option that people will 
see greater selections, longer hours, 
and lower prices for alcohol. Penn-
sylvania politicians may not have 
passed legislation regarding priva-
tization this summer, but Lehigh 
Valley local newspaper The Morning 
Call mentioned that this issue may 
be debated in the fall. Let’s hope our 
legislators make the right decision.
Legislators would be wise to privatize sale of alcohol
John Hannon, associate dean of 
student affairs, recently emailed stu-
dents not in university housing infor-
mation about living off campus. The 
information encompasses appropri-
ate off-campus conduct, police pres-
ence, student-neighbor relations, 
landlords, over-occupancy, garbage, 
and parking. 
The email provides information 
often overlooked or forgotten and is 
a welcome resource for students; it 
is a positive sign from the university 
that it encourages a safe community 
for not only students living on cam-
pus, but for upperclassmen living off 
campus as well. However, the email 
could have been organized more ef-
fectively to interest students in the 
information.
While some information in the 
email may be obvious, such as the in-
creased presence of police in nearby 
neighborhoods, other bits of infor-
mation could easily be unknown. 
For example, the email describes 
that city zoning codes require that 
no more than three unrelated peo-
ple live in a single-family residence. 
Landlords may overlook this rule, 
but the rule can later be enforced to 
evict students if police ?nd that they 
have violated the zoning codes. The 
email gives students the opportunity 
to comply with the code and other 
city laws, such as parking laws, if 
they do not currently.
The university should be recog-
nized for reaching out to its students 
to provide them with information 
that can ease the transition to liv-
ing off campus. This compilation of 
city information is a useful resource 
that can be referenced as needed 
throughout the year.
Unfortunately, this helfpful in-
formation was buried in block af-
ter block of poorly formatted and 
hard-to-read text, and this informa-
tion should be placed on a univer-
sity resources page for off-campus 
students. A more inviting email or 
website may encourage students to 
read this generally useful informa-
tion. The attempt by the university 
to reach out to students living off 
campus is appreciated, but that at-
tempt to reach out must be more vis-
ible, rather than hidden in a lengthy 
email.
Email contains welcome but disorganized information

President Barack Obama is seek-
ing Congressional approval of a mili-
tary attack on Syria after the Syrian 
government launched a sarin gas 
attack in late August, according to 
Reuters. The chemical attack killed 
over 1,400 people, many of them 
civilians. The United States’ long 
history of involving itself in foreign 
affairs necessitates a response to 
the attack. The U.S. should involve 
itself in the Syrian con?ict, but not 
through military force.
The American population is not at 
all convinced that a military attack is 
the solution to the Syrian issue, with 
only 36 percent of Americans in fa-
vor of such action, according to a re-
cent Gallup Poll. The editorial board 
of The Seattle Times argues that the 
situation is both uncontrollable and 
unpredictable, and ultimately not 
the responsibility of Americans, who 
are tired of being at war despite the 
recent atrocities that the Syrian gov-
ernment has committed.
However, the Syrian govern-
ment’s actions are unconscionable, 
and must be addressed. The recent 
chemical attacks are only part of the 
violent situation that Syria has faced 
during its current civil war, which 
has been going on for nearly 30 
months. Two million refugees have 
been displaced to surrounding na-
tions while 4.2 million people have 
been displaced internally — over 
half of whom are children, accord-
ing to Human Rights Watch. The 
displacement of Syrian citizens is 
not the only problem spilling into 
surrounding nations: The instability 
of the country could easily spread 
throughout the region, according 
to Freedom House, which cited Tur-
key recently engaging Syrian forces 
across the border and Israel bomb-
ing a convoy on the outskirts of 
Damascus.
But what can be done about this 
situation, given the American pub-
lic’s reluctance to commit military 
resources? Thankfully, interven-
tion can come in forms other than 
bombs, and many organizations 
have suggestions as to how to aid 
Syria without direct military action. 
Human Rights Watch advises that 
the G-20, a forum for international 
cooperation on important global is-
sues, make a priority of aiding refu-
gees and stopping the ?ow of arms 
into the region. One of Syria’s big-
gest weapons suppliers is Russia, 
which is a member of the G-20. The 
G-20 can pressure Russia and Syria’s 
surrounding nations to stop deal-
ing through trade sanctions speci?-
cally targeting arms deals. Freedom 
House suggests that the U.S. pro-
vide ?nancial support to Syrian civil 
rights groups, in order to aid the 
development of democratic institu-
tions. With this support, Syria could 
move toward stabilizing itself.
Of course, many call for justice, 
as well as aid. Sixty-four countries 
have urged the United Nations Secu-
rity Council to refer Syria to the In-
ternational Criminal Court, accord-
ing to the Human Rights Watch.
The refugees are of great concern 
at this time, as they are among the 
people most damaged by the Syr-
ian con?ict. Aiding them and the 
countries that support them without 
resorting to military attacks could 
ease some of the region’s tension.

U.S. must deal with Syria
SATVIKA NETI
After the publication of Stephenie 
Meyer’s Twilight series, young adult 
literature once again became a vi-
able genre. New fantasy ?ction be-
came popular, one of these series 
being The Mortal Instruments, writ-
ten by Cassandra Clare. It’s an elab-
orate series with incredible fantasy 
elements and ?eshed-out characters 
that has gripped millions of readers.
Too bad the series is allegedly 
plagiarized. Clare started writing 
under the moniker Cassandra Clare 
in a Harry Potter fan base. She was 
popular in those circles because of 
her fan ?ction, The Draco Trilogy, 
which paired Draco and Ginny from 
Harry Potter — a moody bad boy 
paired with a feisty redhead. Do the 
characters sound familiar to those 
from The Mortal Instruments?
Of course, this similarity isn’t in-
herently bad. Basing a story off of 
characters that have already been 
written about is not a crime. It tra-
verses into gray areas, though, when 
an author’s characters are based off 
of interpretations of another au-
thor’s characters that have already 
been used in another franchise.
It gets worse. One day, Harry 
Potter fans awoke to ?nd Clare’s 
story removed from the Internet. 
Slowly, the news got around: Huge 
chunks of her story had been  cop-
ied and pasted from other works 
that weren’t even Harry Potter. The 
characters were hers, but the witty, 
snappy writing that her readers fell 
in love with was not her own.
Fan ?ction is a gray area for copy-
right anyway, because the source 
text is someone else’s work. Some 
authors have spoken out against fan 
?ction based on their works, but J.K. 
Rowling is not one of those authors. 
She has made it clear, though, that 
she doesn’t want money being made 
from Harry Potter fan ?ction. And 
while what Clare did with The Draco 
Trilogy was wrong, she wasn’t mak-
ing money off of the Harry Potter 
series or the other books she had al-
legedly plagiarized from — until she 
published The Mortal Instruments.
When her ?rst book, City of Bones 
came out, Clare’s fan ?ction read-
ers were excited, until they actually 
started reading the book and experi-
enced déjà vu. The protagonist Clary 
was Clare’s interpretation of Ginny 
in The Draco Trilogy; Jace was her 
Draco interpretation; Luke was her 
idea of Lupin and some of the writ-
ing seemed lifted off of the pages of 
her fan ?ction, most of which she 
had allegedly plagiarized from other 
sources. Now she is making money 
from a series based off of fan ?c-
tion that was based not only off of 
Harry Potter but of other source ma-
terial she liberally borrowed from.
With a movie now out, this wom-
an keeps making money with recy-
cled writing and characters that are 
not even hers, and she won’t listen 
to anyone against her. Authors who 
plagiarize do not deserve the pro?ts 
and acclaim that Clare has received, 
and de?nitely not the promotion of 
her work in the form of a major mo-
tion picture.

Sesame Street’s focus on STEM elements admirable
The perennial children’s educa-
tional TV show Sesame Street has a 
special place in the hearts of many 
Americans. The show and its world-
wide counterparts have taught chil-
dren the fundamentals of learning 
and life lessons since 1969.
Recently, the program that is 
home to Big Bird, Elmo, and Cookie 
Monster expanded its curriculum to 
develop a stronger focus on the sci-
ence, technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) ?elds. 
According to The New York Times, 
the program is putting more of 
an emphasis “on urging children 
to investigate, as opposed to sim-
ply explore.” Teaching this kind 
of analytical thinking — even at 
a very early age — is crucial, and 
Sesame Street should be applauded 
for expanding the show’s content to 
include STEM topics.
According to Forbes magazine, the 
science and engineering workforce 
is responsible for over 50 percent of 
the nation’s sustained economic ex-
pansion; however, only 5 percent of 
the overall workforce is employed in 
these ?elds. This disparity between 
expansion and job demand occurs at 
a time when the educational leaders 
of the U.S. are decrying an innova-
tion de?cit.
Only 17 percent of high school 
seniors are both interested in pursu-
ing higher education in STEM and 
quali?ed or skilled enough to do so, 
according to The Washington Post. 
Thus, it’s imperative that children 
not only receive a STEM education 
at an early age, but also develop a 
strong interest in science and ana-
lytical thinking.
The success of Carnegie Mellon 
and other STEM-focused institutions 
is dependent on a steady source of 
inquisitive and intelligent students 
and faculty. STEM is shaping so 
much of the job market that leaving 
it out of a child’s education would be 
equivalent to preparing them for a 
world very different from ours today. 
Programs like Sesame Street 
deserve the recognition for be-
ing pioneers in developing such 
an accessible STEM curriculum for 
young children, and hopefully the 
country’s own public education sys-
tem follows suit.

Former New York City police 
commissioner and Los Angeles po-
lice chief Bill Bratton aims to launch 
a social network for police of?cers 
called BlueLine at the International 
Association of Police Chiefs’s annual 
conference in October, according to 
the Associated Press. Bratton hopes 
the network will connect the nation’s 
police and allow them to more easily 
combat gangs and terrorists, as well 
as share their best practices.
While Bratton’s intentions for a 
social network are innovative for 
preventing crime in theory, it must 
be asked if the site is a necessary or 
useful addition to the arsenal of tools 
already at police disposal.
Although Bratton’s attempt to 
introduce a social platform for a re-
spected group of professionals is ad-
mirable, there may be more effective 
ways to connect of?cers privately. It 
is understandable that with the pop-
ularity of social media sites, Bratton 
wanted to jump on the bandwagon, 
but these sites may not be appropri-
ate in a professional context. Other 
professional social networks like 
LinkedIn are open to the public, 
and pro?les are under scrutiny by 
other professionals. In a private set-
ting, law enforcement of?cers may 
be more likely to share personal or 
sensitive information that could be 
released to the public by another 
individual using the site. Perhaps it 
would be more appropriate for of?-
cers who have sensitive jobs to use a 
traditional intranet website that does 
not emulate Facebook pro?les.
Bratton hopes that BlueLine will 
solve the lack of communication be-
tween of?cers, but the small poten-
tial user base for the site may prevent 
increased talk. 
Through platforms like Twitter 
and Facebook, the world has seen 
that social networks can strengthen 
the relationships between various 
communities, from college students 
to businesses. These platforms are 
successful, though, because they 
cater to large audiences — unlike 
BlueLine, which is limited to one 
profession.
According to the Bureau of Justice 
Statistics’s 2008 Census of State and 
Local Law Enforcement Agencies, 
there are currently more than 1.1 
million state and local law enforce-
ment personnel in the United States. 
This number may seem large, but not 
compared to the 1.11 billion users 
worldwide that Facebook says it has. 
Now compare these numbers to what 
Facebook estimates to be 2.7 billion 
people worldwide who have Inter-
net access. With little quali?cation 
needed to create an account on Face-
book — or other sites like Twitter and 
Pinterest — there is a current poten-
tial user base of 2.7 billion people. 
Now, compare this to the seemingly 
insigni?cant 1.1 million potential law 
enforcement of?cers who could use 
BlueLine. The potential user base 
seems, and will probably be, relative-
ly small — possibly too small to gain 
traction among of?cers.
Furthermore, 20for25.com — an-
other social networking site for po-
lice of?cers — already launched in 
August, according to NBC News. The 
existence of more than one police 
networking site could further lower 
BlueLine’s user base by dispersing of-
?cers across the Internet.
Bratton’s vision to unite of?cers 
across the nation is highly desirable 
in an increasingly connected world, 
but a website identi?ed as a social 
network may not have a large enough 
audience or the professional quality 
needed to achieve this vision.

When it comes to political poli-
cies, the public wants simple answers 
to blunt questions: Is politician A’s 
new strategy good? Are country B’s 
actions deplorable? Policy is easy to 
judge when the issue is black and 
white. In every debate, however, 
there are gray areas — these make 
writers’ jobs challenging when deal-
ing with polarizing issues.
In the Aug. 30 edition of The 
Washington Post, Betsy Karasik ex-
plored gray areas in her op-ed, “The 
unintended consequences of laws 
addressing sex between teachers 
and students.” As uncomfortable as 
her argument is, she raises a worthy 
discussion, and the article does not 
deserve the backlash it has received.
Karasik argues that the criminal-
ization of consensual sex between 
teacher and student — resulting in 
law proceedings that are often drawn 
out and heavily scrutinized by the 
media — does more harm than good.
“The intensity of criminal pro-
ceedings — with all the pressure 
they put on participants, the stigma, 
the community and media scrutiny, 
and the concurrent shame and guilt 
they generate — do the opposite of 
healing and protecting the victim,” 
she said.
Her article was written in re-
sponse to the 30-day sentencing of 
teacher Stacey Rambold, who plead-
ed guilty to raping a 14-year-old stu-
dent, and it has enraged readers.
One reader’s comment states, 
“As far as I’m concerned, [Karasik] 
is as bad as a sexual predator. She is 
able and willing to rationalize sexual 
predation to the point that if she wit-
nessed it, I doubt she would do any-
thing to stop it.”
ThinkProgress, a progressive blog, 
criticized and simpli?ed Karasik’s 
argument down to the idea that con-
sensual sex between student and 
teacher should not be criminalized.
Critics miss many of Karasik’s 
points by overlooking the gray areas.
Karasik never explicitly states that 
student-teacher sex should not be 
criminalized. Although legal action 
may not be taken, she advocates for 
professional action. In fact, she says, 
“Teachers who engage in sex with 
students ... should be removed from 
their jobs and barred from teach-
ing unless they prove that they have 
completed rehabilitation.”
While having sex with an under-
age student is a blatant abuse of 
teacher power and rightfully falls un-
der the crime of statutory rape, the 
public attention and the stares from 
classmates can do more harm to the 
student than good. In the case Kara-
sik references, the student commit-
ted suicide two years after the initial 
incident, as the case was pending. No 
one will ever know what led her to 
take her life, but the timing suggests 
that it was the events following, rath-
er than the sex itself, that pushed her.
It is unfortunate that many read-
ers drew such hasty conclusions, as if 
one must be either for or against the 
criminalization of statutory rape. The 
moral spectrum Karasik proposes, 
however, is much more delicate and 
complex than such binarism.
What Karasik offers is not a solu-
tion to a dividing issue, but a start-
ing point for a new discussion. To 
interpret her argument as a de?nitive 
proclamation on what must be done 
would be to overlook the gray areas 
that Karasik tries to clarify.

The ?rst time I stepped onto 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus last fall 
for my campus tour, I couldn’t help 
but notice countless festivities oc-
curring beside the Fence, plaid as 
far as the eye could see, and a di-
verse array of students. Little did I 
know that just a year from my ?rst 
visit, this campus would become a 
place that I would learn to know 
and love.
I thought that my social life 
would be the price I’d have to pay 
to go to a school that excelled aca-
demically. Stereotypically, Carn-
egie Mellon is known as a school 
with all of the work and none of 
the play. 
However, it is clear that this ste-
reotype isn’t accurate after my ?rst 
few weeks as a student.
The people I have befriended 
remind me of myself. The various 
events throughout Orientation 
week, such as Playfair and House 
Wars, have revealed just how so-
cial, friendly, and exciting the stu-
dent body is at Carnegie Mellon. 
The campus is very different 
from where I was raised in rural 
Pennsylvania, and different in a 
fantastic way.
When I began classes, my love 
for Carnegie Mellon continued to 
grow. I was amazed by how much I 
learned each day. In a single week, 
I have learned what would have 
taken weeks or months in high 
school. 
My professors are the best in 
the game, and have already helped 
me to discover things I never real-
ized. When I nerded out over an 
explanation of how integration-
by-parts is essentially the opposite 
of the product rule, I realized that 
this is where I belong.
There is, however, one Carn-
egie Mellon stereotype that seems 
to hold true: This university is 
a place where each and every 
student’s heart is in the work, a 
mentality that is perhaps the best 
thing about Carnegie Mellon. The 
people I have met thus far, from 
?rst-years to seniors, are passion-
ate about what they do. 
There are future CEOs, engi-
neers, Hollywood actors or ac-
tresses, and scientists taking part 
in the hefty workload that has 
already brought so many before 
them to success. While the work-
load here is undeniably demand-
ing, the students still take part in 
activities that they love and enjoy 
social lives, contrary to any ste-
reotypes. A walk through the hun-
dreds of tables at the Activities Fair 
is enough to prove that students 
are passionate and are active on 
and off campus.
Carnegie Mellon is a place 
where people have fun, whether 
they’re working or playing. There 
is never a dull moment. Whether 
they are spent exploring the city 
or determining the name of a mys-
tery function in Principles of Im-
perative Computation, every day 
at Carnegie Mellon promises to be 
an exciting one.

After four teasing weeks of 
preseason while only getting 
glimpses of the starters, we 
?nally get some real football. 
This weekend saw the start of 
the NFL season, and predic-
tions abound as to how each 
NFL division will ?nish come 
January.
AFC East
For the past decade, this di-
vision has been dominated by 
the New England Patriots un-
der head coach Bill Belichick 
and quarterback Tom Brady. 
The Miami Dolphins represent 
the only real threat to their 
reign, but even with their high-
pro?le free-agent acquisitions 
of wide receiver Mike Wal-
lace and linebacker Dannell 
Ellerbe, they still appear to be a 
few years and few playmakers 
away. 
The Buffalo Bills and New 
York Jets are starting rookie 
quarterbacks E. J. Manuel and 
Geno Smith, respectively. Both 
teams rely heavily on their de-
fense, but neither looks to be a 
serious contender.
AFC North
Home to the Super Bowl 
champions Baltimore Ravens 
and the Pittsburgh Steelers, 
this is shaping up to be the 
toughest division in the AFC 
yet again. 
The Ravens, Steelers, and 
Cincinnati Bengals are likely 
playoff contenders. The Ben-
gals look to be in the driver’s 
seat to win the division with 
third-year quarterback Andy 
Dalton and his top target A. J. 
Green. Combined with the best 
defensive line in the league, 
these assets have turned the 
Bengals into a Super Bowl 
threat. The Ravens are deal-
ing with major losses on both 
sides of the ball with leader 
Ray Lewis retiring and veteran 
wide receiver Anquan Boldin 
being traded away. The Steel-
ers are still aging and returning 
many of the same pieces that 
produced a disappointing 8–8 
season a year ago. The Cleve-
land Browns, while improving, 
are still easily the worst in this 
division.
AFC South
The Houston Texans look 
to make another appearance 
as division winners under de-
fensive lineman J. J. Watt and 
running back Arian Foster. The 
only major addition is former 
Ravens safety Ed Reed, who is 
starting off the season with an 
injury. The Indianapolis Colts 
surprisingly made the playoffs 
last year under then-rookie 
quarterback Andrew Luck and 
look to repeat the feat this year. 
It may be dif?cult, though, as 
many expect the team to hit a 
sophomore slump and take a 
step or two back. The Tennes-
see Titans and Jacksonville 
Jaguars are both trying to 
evaluate their young quarter-
backs, Jake Locker and Blaine 
Gabbert, in an attempt to de-
cide whether or not to move on 
from their young projects.
AFC West
The Denver Broncos have 
put the division in their rear-
view mirror as they focus sole-
ly on winning the Super Bowl. 
Quarterback Peyton Manning 
knows he only has a year or 
two left and is giving it every-
thing he’s got. The Kansas City 
Chiefs are a completely new 
team after trading for quarter-
back Alex Smith and signing 
former Philadelphia Eagles 
head coach Andy Reid. The 
San Diego Chargers are under 
new management with a new 
coach and general manager, 
but most of the personnel re-
mains the same and thus so 
will their record. Unsurpris-
ingly, the Oakland Raiders are 
in disarray with quarterback 
Terrelle Pryor coming out of 
nowhere to steal the starting 
quarterback job.
NFC East
Every year the fate of this 
division comes down to the last 
game, and this year seems to 
be no different. The New York 
Giants, Dallas Cowboys, and 
Washington Redskins each had 
a chance to win the division 
in the ?nal game of last year’s 
season and all come back with 
virtually the same teams. With 
some substantial injuries to 
Redskins quarterback Robert 
Grif?n III, and the Cowboys 
and Giants lines, this will likely 
be a war of attrition. The only 
major changes come with the 
Eagles, where Chip Kelly has 
replaced Andy Reid as coach. 
Kelly brings a very up-tempo 
college offense with him and 
looks to shake up the NFL, but 
is likely not to be competitive 
this season.
NFC North
This is another division that 
looks to be a dog ?ght with all 
four teams having legitimate 
playoff aspirations. The Green 
Bay Packers look the best on 
paper, but their rookie-based 
running games and sketchy 
secondary could be their 
downfall. The Minnesota Vi-
kings’ hopes rest solely on the 
shoulders of MVP Adrian Pe-
terson, with quarterback Chris-
tian Ponder acting more as a 
facilitator than a playmaker. 
The Chicago Bears and Detroit 
Lions both underperformed 
last year and have serious ques-
tions speci?cally concerning 
the offense for Chicago and the 
defense for Detroit.
NFC South
With the return of coach 
Sean Payton, the New Orleans 
Saints are looking to bounce 
back from a disappointing sea-
son. The Atlanta Falcons are 
returning a very similar team 
to last year’s division-winning 
squad with veteran running 
back Steven Jackson replacing 
Michael Turner. The Tampa 
Bay Buccaneers and Carolina 
Panthers are both trying to 
evaluate their young quarter-
backs, Josh Freeman and Cam 
Newton, who are not quite liv-
ing up to expectations they set 
after their ?rst few years in the 
league.
NFC West
This is by far the most 
stacked division in the NFL. 
The San Francisco 49ers and 
Seattle Seahawks are debat-
ably the top two teams in the 
NFL and will be slugging it out 
for the division. Both feature 
young mobile quarterbacks 
and very strong defenses. The 
St. Louis Rams look to make 
major strides under their sec-
ond season with coach Jeff 
Fisher, and they have hope af-
ter ?nishing 4–1–1 in the divi-
sion last season. 
The Arizona Cardinals are 
the wild card with new coach 
Bruce Arians and quarterback 
Carson Palmer. If Palmer can 
?nd his timing with all-pro re-
ceiver Larry Fitzgerald, look for 
the Cardinals to have a good 
season.

Carnegie Mellon’s wom-
en’s soccer team kicked off its 
season with one tie (1–1) and 
one loss (3–2) in this week-
end’s DoubleTree Tartan Cup. 
The Tartans started the sea-
son ranked ?fth, their highest-
ever national ranking, in the 
NSCAA/Continental Tire Di-
vision III.
The ?rst game of the Dou-
bleTree Tartan Cup, a tour-
nament among the top ten 
nationally ranked teams, fea-
tured Carnegie Mellon against 
Ohio Northern University last 
Saturday. 
The Ohio Northern Polar 
Bears struck ?rst 26 minutes 
into the game. Goalkeeper 
Anna Albi was forced to leave 
her net due to a challenge on 
the right wing by Ohio North-
ern’s Sandy Plunkett.
Down 1–0 at halftime, the 
Tartans dominated the sec-
ond half. In the 54th minute, 
junior forward Amanda So 
scored The Tartans’ ?rst and 
only goal of the match. 
The goal came after senior 
defender Rachel Contopoulos 
lobbed a pass right behind the 
Ohio Northern defense to So, 
who anticipated the ball and 
snuck it beneath the goalie. 
Despite controlling most of 
the possession and outshoot-
ing the Polar Bears 12–2, the 
Tartans failed to score the de-
cisive goal, resulting in a 1–1 
tie.
The following game on 
Sunday saw Carnegie Mellon 
women’s soccer team facing 
Johns Hopkins University, 
ranked as the seventh-best 
team nationally. 
In the 18th minute, So 
opened up the scoring again 
for the Tartans. So made it 
a hat trick for the weekend 
when she scored six minutes 
later after a through pass from 
sophomore Carson Quiros.
Johns Hopkins responded 
and evened the score within 
the next seven minutes. Hop-
kins scored the game-winning 
goal in the 56th minute with 
a penalty kick by Sydney Teng 
and would hold onto the lead 
for a 3–2 victory.
On Wednesday, Carnegie 
Mellon’s women’s soccer team 
will travel to Washington & 
Jefferson College to compete 
against the Presidents and try 
to improve their 1–1–1 record.

Editor-in-Chief
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team began 
September with a crushing 
double-overtime loss at Dick-
inson College last Saturday, 
only to emerge victorious in 
a shutout at Elizabethtown 
College yesterday, bringing 
its record to 3–1.
The match started with 
an early Dickinson lead after 
their only regulation goal by 
Dickinson mid?elder Isaac 
Pitkow in the ?fth minute. It 
wasn’t until the second half 
that the Tartans got on the 
board with senior mid?elder 
Matt Sarett’s score against 
Dickinson goalkeeper Reed 
Milbrath with less than 15 
minutes in regulation left.
However, the major up-
set came in double overtime 
with two seconds left, when 
Dickinson forward Alfred 
Hylton-Dei scored the deci-
sive goal.
Senior mid?elder Mike 
Ferraco gave the Dickinson 
team credit for their perfor-
mance on the ?eld. “Dick-
inson was the best team we 
played this week,” Ferraco 
said. “The best team we’ve 
played so far.”
The main talking point of 
the match against Dickinson 
was de?nitely how unbeliev-
ably close it was between the 
two teams. “It was a crazy 
game, really bizarre,” said 
senior defender Ben Bryant. 
Ferraco agreed, saying that, 
“It was ridiculous game, ev-
erything that could have hap-
pened did.”
After the heartbreaking 
defeat at Dickinson, the Tar-
tans were ready to bring their 
A-game to Elizabethtown, 
Pa. for their next match. “We 
were trying to learn some les-
sons from [Saturday]’s loss,” 
Bryant said.
After an early barrage of 
shots by the Tartans against 
Elizabethtown, senior de-
fender/mid?elder Jerome 
Reano delivered, scoring the 
only goal of the game in the 
42nd minute. 
With some crucial saves 
by junior goalkeeper Jacob 
Rice, the team was able to 
hold for a 1–0 shutout win 
against Elizabethtown, leav-
ing the Tartans with a 3–1 
record.
The team was motivated 
after Saturday to execute and 
come back strong on Sunday. 
“We bounced back really well 
today,” Ferraco said. “It’s 
hard to come off of a loss like 
that.”
Four games into the sea-
son, the team is looking for-
ward to making the grade. 
“Our next few games are 
where we are really going to 
have to prove ourselves,” Fer-
raco said.
The Tartans are hopeful 
that their experiences so far 
in the season will help do 
exactly that. “You learn from 
your mistakes,” Bryant said, 
“and that’s something we 
want to carry on.”
The men’s soccer team 
will face Geneva College this 
Wednesday at a 7 p.m. match 
at home, followed by an away 
game against Allegheny Col-
lege on Saturday at 1 p.m.

Fall ushers in new fashion
September’s chills are reason to revamp your wardrobe
The start of September brings cold weather in the 
mornings and evenings while you’re walking to and 
from home, but warm weather during the day when 
you’re walking around campus. As a result, many 
people might currently be facing the dilemma of 
what to wear.
Since it’s too early for winter clothes and too chilly 
for summer wear, the natural solution is to mix 
elements of the two. Not only will this better prepare 
you for the ever-changing climate, you’ll also be able 
to wear your favorite sundress for longer than you 
expected. Below are a couple tips that will help you 
dress for current weather patterns and transition 
your summer clothes into the fall.
Summer Skirts and Dresses
If you think it’s time to put away your summer skirts 
and dresses, think again. With boots and socks or 
tights, they can make for a great fall outfit. Try either 
type of legwear in a pattern to add interest to the 
look, but make sure they don’t clash with the pattern 
of your skirt or dress. Shorter boots are better for this 
look — combat boots are especially fashion forward.
You can also make your skirt or dress weather 
appropriate by throwing on a light fall jacket, a 
cardigan, or a sweater. Common choices of jacket 
for this time of year include denim or, as it gets 
colder, leather. Military jackets have been in style 
for a while, and they make perfect fall jackets. When 
they’re paired with floral skirts and dresses, the 
result is a girly-meets-edgy look.
Maxi Dresses
Maxi dresses are a comfortable warm weather outfit, 
but they’re difficult to style. Can such a summer 
staple be worn in the fall?
Some “experts” say no; others say yes, so it’s all a 
matter of personal opinion. Fashion blogger Lauren 
Conrad indicated on her blog that “the style is 
...perfect for transitioning your summer wardrobe 
into fall.” Conrad also advises that proportion is key 
and recommends cropped sweaters and jackets to 
complete the look.
Maxi dresses are on the bohemian side as far as 
trends go, and Free People Clothing Boutique is a 
useful source for inspiration on how to style them. 
In general, the maxi dresses featured on the website 
have been paired with short combat boots and follow 
LC’s advice with sweaters and jackets that are a 
shorter length.
Other Pieces
Summer tank tops can also make for versatile pieces. 
They provide an alternative to wearing sweaters and 
pullovers during colder weather, since you can layer 
them with cardigans. Add a light scarf to make the 
look more interesting and add a little extra warmth. 
Tank tops that are a longer length could be worn 
with leggings or jeggings and tall boots.
As for shoes, sandals and flip flops might be 
wearable for another week or two, but as it starts 
getting colder you should begin making the change 
to close-toed shoes. Oxfords and ballet flats are both 
useful intermediates between summer and winter 
shoes, though some people feel comfortable enough 
wearing their boots all year round.
When transitioning your wardrobe from summer to 
autumn, the key is to mix and match elements from 
both seasons while making sure that colors, patterns, 
and proportions are all in order.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Ryan,
I thought taking five 
classes and joining a 
bunch of clubs after the 
Activities Fair was a good 
idea and that I’d totally be 
able to handle it, but I was 
so, so wrong. How do I 
handle this stress and still 
do everything I want to 
do? I thought college was 
supposed to be fun!
Sincerely,
Oh Boy; Vexed, 
Increasingly Oblivious 
Underclassman, Seriously 
Lost, Young Abductee 
Feels Really Eager, 
Shows Hopefulness, 
Maddeningly Aggressively 
Naive
Dear OBVIOUSLY A 
FRESHMAN,
There are two things you’re 
going to need to learn, and 
learn quickly, if you’re going 
to survive at Carnegie Mellon 
(and at college in general). 
You’ve got to learn to 
prioritize your activities and 
manage your time. 
If you’re taking a class that 
you really don’t like, don’t 
be afraid to reorganize 
your schedule (especially if 
that class is not required). 
Who knows — you may 
end up finding something 
you like better to put in its 
place. There’s a certain 
push at Carnegie Mellon 
toward taking 70 units each 
semester because hey, you 
can do it, right?
Maybe. But instead of taking 
that extra class to get that 
fifth minor, try joining some 
clubs. Lots of clubs! But 
then only stick with the one 
or two you really like and 
enjoy being a part of. You 
can like writing more than 
life itself, but if you have a 
nasty editor it can make 
the whole experience turn 
sour — something that this 
writer can happily admit 
he has never experienced! 
Just remember that you are 
here to get a degree, so if 
you find yourself struggling 
to pass your classes (and 
that is pass, not get all As), 
perhaps it’s time to revise 
your commitments.
Second, you must manage 
your time efficiently. I’m not 
going to sit here and preach 
good time management, 
since if you’ve gotten 
into Carnegie Mellon you 
probably have a pretty good 
idea of what works for you 
(and I would not recommend 
my time management style 
to anyone). 
That said, once you’ve 
planned a schedule, do your 
best to stick to it. Because 
once you get off that plan, it 
gets infinitely harder to get 
back on it.
But above all, you should 
monitor yourself and your 
well-being. If you’re not 
happy with something, or 
you find yourself lying awake 
at night questioning your 
decisions, make a change. 
These years are about you. 
That said, don’t forget about 
your friends. There really is 
no substitute for someone 
who takes you out of your 
own head for a while.
For the love of all that you 
hold dear, be happy.
Or maybe it just gets

True to form, the Andy Warhol Museum currently has 
three unique and thought-provoking exhibits set to 
close on Sept. 15. S/HE IS HER/E is a retrospective on 
the work of artist Genesis Breyer P-Orridge; All Through 
the Night features photographs of Pittsburgh’s LGBT 
community taken by photographer Caldwell Linker; and 
The Patron Saint of White Guys That Went Tribal and 
Other Works features sculptures by artist Nick Bubash.
S/HE IS HER/E
This exhibit features the work of Genesis Breyer 
P-Orridge (born Neil Andrew Megson), a revolutionary 
artist who has been creating since the mid ’70s. The 
pieces in this exhibit de?nitely make a strong impact. 
Exploring themes such as open-ended conceptions of 
identity and rebelling against societal norms regarding 
sexuality, S/HE IS HER/E features a number of collages 
that are incredibly violent and sexual. “Untitled” is a 
passport photo showing two different versions of the 
same underlying face, while “Princess of Clubs” features 
images of sexual bondage. At times, S/HE IS HER/E 
can be overwhelming, but one thing is for certain: 
This exhibit will make you think more than any other 
exhibition currently at the Warhol.
All Through the Night
This simple exhibition of Linker’s work celebrates the 
human experience while showcasing Pittsburgh’s 
vibrant LGBTQ community. One walks in and sees an 
entire wall of photos depicting life in all its ups and 
downs. “Veruca, After Getting Beat Up” depicts a young 
person with a black eye in the shower, highlighting 
the struggle for acceptance still faced by the LGBTQ 
community.
Not all the photos are so somber, though. “Lee Relvas 
& Silky” portrays two young lovers sharing a tender 
moment in a bedroom. The piece brims with the 
happiness and excitement of teenage love.
The entire collection is incredibly varied. “Alaska & 
Veruca” shows a couple trying on wedding dresses, 
while in “Megan & Libbi” a woman in heavy makeup 
appears nude in a bathroom stall. The subjects in All 
Through the Night have a lust for life that is undeniable 
and infectious; after visiting, one gains renewed passion 
for his or her own life.
The Patron Saint of White Guys That Went Tribal 
and Other Works
The museum describes this exhibition as “a collection of 
sculptures made from bric-a-brac, toys, tattoo needles, 
and other inexplicable consumer culture cast-offs,” and 
that’s pretty spot on. Artist Nick Bubash has created a 
number of visually stimulating and diverse sculptures. 
They range from the incredibly ornate “Patron Saint of 
White Guys That Went Tribal” to the sparse “Man Is 
Praying, Prayingmanis,” a reproduction of the Venus Di 
Milo with a seashell hat.
Many of the pieces are very colorful and appear to 
contain several hundred components at the very least. 
“Portrait of a Serial Killer” features tiny cats and skulls 
with glowing eyes with references to voodoo dolls and 
other seemingly evil spirits. “Cacophony of Cacophonus” 
looks just as it sounds — a collection of ?gures made 
from junk found in the bottom of a toy box all standing 
together at attention. While Nick Bubash’s works don’t 
leave the same impact as P-Orridge’s or Linker’s, they 
are still something to marvel at.

Warning: This article contains spoilers for the ?rst two 
seasons of American Horror Story.
October is just around the corner, and with it will come 
the premiere of the much-anticipated third season of 
FX’s American Horror Story.
American Horror Story is a miniseries, meaning that 
each season has a plot line independent of previous 
seasons. For this reason, little is known about what to 
expect in the third season, but here’s what we know.
FX recently announced via the of?cial American 
Horror Story Facebook page that the new season, 
titled American Horror Story: Coven, will premiere on 
Wednesday, Oct. 9 at 10 p.m. EST. The 13-episode 
miniseries will revolve around a coven of witches who 
are mysteriously attacked 300 years after the Salem 
witch trials and who come into contact with voodoo 
priestesses; it will take place in both the 1830s and in the 
present, according to The Latin Times.
Series veteran Jessica Lange will be a part of the coven 
as Fiona, the Supreme Witch, says FX via Facebook. 
Fiona will teach young witches to protect themselves 
from the mysterious attacks at a witch academy. Lange 
has played standout characters in previous seasons: 
youth-obsessed neighbor Constance Langdon in the 
?rst season and discipline-crazy Sister Jude in the 
second season. Her insecurities in both seasons made 
her characters relatable, yet her actions also made her 
unlikable. In the ?rst season, Lange’s character was 
ashamed of her daughter and her own wrinkled face, and 
in the second season, her character was overwhelmed 
with guilt about the death of a young girl.
FX also revealed on the American Horror Story Facebook 
page that actress Taissa Farmiga, who played Violet 
Harmon during the ?rst season, will now play a young 
witch named Zoe, one of Fiona’s pupils. Sarah Paulson 
— Lana Winters in American Horror Story: Asylum — 
announced at the Television Critics Association fall 
previews in August that she will play Fiona’s daughter, 
Cordelia, according to TV Guide. Other returning cast 
members con?rmed by FX include Lily Rabe, Frances 
Conroy, Evan Peters, Denis O’Hare, and Kathy Bates. 
New cast members include Gabourey Sidibe, Patti 
LuPone, Emma Roberts, Alexander Dreymon, and 
Angela Bassett.
Bassett will play real-life ?gure Marie Laveau, a Voodoo 
practitioner known throughout New Orleans in the 
1800s, while Bates will play Delphine LaLaurie, a historic 
serial killer known for murdering slaves, according to TV 
Guide.
Absent from the cast of returning characters is Zachary 
Quinto, whose presence will be sorely missed. Quinto 
appeared in both previous seasons, but had an integral 
role in the second season as a psychiatrist with a dark 
side. Quinto delivered a truly disturbing performance in 
the second season, providing periods of unnerving calm 
in tense situations and releases of anger that were sure 
to make viewers tremble with horri?ed pleasure.
Beginning Aug. 29, FX released a series of teaser 
trailers for Coven. The ?rst trailer, “Detention,” depicts 
women ?oating in the air pressed against various 
walls of a white room and hanging in the recesses of a 
blackened ?replace. Other teaser trailers depict witches 
burning on stakes, a mysterious person punctured by 
pins like a voodoo doll, and a woman buried alive but 
calmly moving about beneath the ground. The teasers 
are snappy and hint at what will hopefully be another 
visually stunning season. The ?rst season provided 
intense images for the viewer to cling to, such as the 
black-suited “Rubber Man” and a white-walled bathroom 
with its white bathtub, while the second season was 
more atmospheric with its elaborate set pieces including 
the laboratory of Dr. Arthur Arden and the cells of the 
asylum’s patients.
Sarah Paulson claimed that the show will have a lighter 
tone than previous seasons, according to The Today 
Show. However, the teasers hint otherwise.
The ?rst season successfully incorporated lighthearted 
elements into its disturbing plot, which revolved around 
a haunted house with murderers and baby-stealing 
ghosts. For example, mother Vivien Harmon, played 
by actress Connie Britton, joined a bus tour led by an 
eccentric guide that passed by her new home — dubbed 
the “Murder House” — in order to learn about its past. 
The characters were also provided escape from their 
horrors through various normal locales, such as homely 
kitchens and family-friendly neighborhood streets.
The series is most intriguing, however, when its 
characters are subjected to elements of classic horror. 
While the ?rst season was scary, the second season 
raised the bar by placing its characters within an 
asylum, with no reprieve from the horrors that confronted 
them. Moments of humor were replaced by mad 
scientists, possessed nuns, and monstrous experimental 
creations.
The atmosphere of the second season was more effective 
at creating a truly terrifying experience for the viewer, 
and this relentlessness is something that the creators of 
the series would be wise to continue throughout season 
three.
The latest season of American Horror Story is shaping 
up to be a promising installment in the anthology-like 
miniseries from the minds of creators Ryan Murphy and 
Brad Falchuk, with what will hopefully be a strong set of 
scares from an all-star cast.

What happens when a group of spoiled and rebellious teens robs the homes of 
Hollywood’s elite? They appear in a movie about their debauchery directed by ?lm 
princess So?a Coppola. While it is based on shallow indulgence with pop culture, 
The Bling Ring proves to be entertaining. Emma Watson nails the Valley Girl persona 
as the ringleader of Hollywood’s most notorious gang. Coupled with a banging 
soundtrack and cameos from the faces of pop culture (ahem, Paris Hilton), The Bling 
Ring is deliciously enjoyable and provides a peek into the lives of Hollywood’s most 
dangerous wannabes.

Nants ingonyama bagithi Baba…sithi uhm ingonyama!
With the classic opening notes that have been so deeply 
ingrained in so many childhoods, the musical rendition 
of Disney’s The Lion King roared into the Benedum 
Center. The show, which will run until Sept. 29, is 
arguably one of the most celebrated musicals ever to 
grace the Broadway stage.
According to a Pittsburgh Cultural Trust press release, 
The Lion King has toured in 70 cities across the United 
States — but that’s one of the least stunning statistics 
about the show. 
The press release goes on to describe how The Lion 
King has been performed for nearly 68 million theater-
goers across all the continents (except Antarctica) to 
gross over $5 billion — more than all the Star Wars ?lms 
combined.
Clearly, this show is doing something right, and it’s 
easy to see why it’s successful after attending the 
Sept. 4 show of the current North American production 
tour. Funded by PNC’s Broadway Across America 
program, the Pittsburgh Cultural Trust, and the 
Pittsburgh Symphony, this stop on the tour is the encore 
performance following the show’s hugely successful 2004 
and 2008 runs.
The show was, in a word, breathtaking. From the 
larger-than-life costumes, to the African drums that beat 
from either side of the stage, to the moments in which, 
yes, even as an almost-20-year-old, I was crying, the 
performance was the de?nition of a spectacle.
The tour also features Carnegie Mellon alumnus Michael 
Hollick (CFA ’95), who tours with the show as a standby 
for Scar — Simba’s cunning and dangerous uncle played 
by Patrick Brown — and for Pumbaa (Ben Lipitz), the 
lovable warthog who, with Timon (Nick Cordileone) the 
meerkat, adopts Simba after he runs away.
After attending the precollege program in 1990, Hollick 
was offered early admission to Carnegie Mellon upon 
auditioning for the School of Drama. One of four students 
admitted that summer, Hollick entered his senior year of 
high school knowing that he was Carnegie Mellon and 
Pittsburgh bound.
Hollick loved his time at Carnegie Mellon and credits 
most of his acting ability to the school’s professors and 
his peers. “Don Wadsworth is a remarkable teacher 
who teaches speech and diction, and the things that he 
taught I still use today. And the thing that’s wonderful 
about him is that he remains in contact with alums, 
including me,” Hollick said.
As a standby, Hollick must be ready to ?ll in for either 
role at the drop of a hat if the actors are sick, injured, on 
vacation, or just taking a personal day.
“It’s a lot of pressure, particularly for a production like 
this one. It’s so highly regarded, and it’s a well-respected 
performance … in every city we go to, we sell out,” 
Hollick said. “These are top-tier, amazing performers: 
You can’t drop the ball.”
Despite the pressure, Hollick always feels prepared to ?ll 
in, should the occasion arise: “Fortunately for me, I went 
to CMU. And that sounds cheesy, but it’s the truth. The 
fact that I’m able to go on at a moment’s notice.… I rely 
on a lot of things I learned there to keep my body, voice, 
and mind in shape to be ready to go on.”
It’s easy to see how the role of a standby for this show 
could be intimidating. Billed as “the world’s number-one 
musical,” The Lion King leaves nothing to be desired.
Perhaps the most entrancing part is the entire visual 
element of the show. Utilizing the entire theater as 
opposed to just the stage, animal puppets stampeded 
down the aisles and cloth birds ?ew jauntily overhead 
to the amusement of the many children sprinkled 
throughout the theater.
Much more engaging than the 1994 movie, the musical 
portrayed the animals in the story through extensive, 
intricately detailed puppets. The characters and their 
emotions were surprisingly easy to distinguish and 
identify based on the masks that the actors wore and 
the personalities that the performers were able to portray 
even through the simplest movements.
The masks, puppets, and other details had a distinct 
African in?uence that ?t in the musical perfectly. African 
nuances were also woven throughout the music, which 
heavily featured two sets of bongo drums and tribal 
chants. Played perfectly by Brown Lindiwe Mkhize, the 
character of Ra?ki — the mystical baboon who inspires 
Simba to see that his father lives on in his heart — used 
the African chanting most prominently.
Furthermore, multiple numbers in the show used a 
simple shadow puppet method of storytelling, while

featuring chanting and dancers dressed in colorful, ?owy 
costumes that were expressive and engaging. This was 
beautifully done and added another cultural element to 
the show that made it deeper and more meaningful.
“[Elements] were drawn from cultural theater, so in 
the show, you’ve got all of these different cultures 
represented. It’s got meat on its bones; it’s not just a 
frivolous musical,” Hollick said.
Hollick, who previously acted in the Las Vegas show, 
describes The Lion King as “a phenomenon.”
“It’s risen to the level of classic material,” he said. 
“You’ve got these intense emotions, quick and hilarious 
comedy, and then an amazing set and costumes to tie it 
all together. It’s an actor’s dream job, really.”
The only underwhelming elements in the show were 
the original songs added to the lineup. In general, the 
audience seemed less engaged during these unfamiliar 
songs. 
This was particularly noticeable during the beginning 
of the second act: In the ?rst half of this act, no songs 
from the well-loved movie were featured. The songs “The 
Madness of King Scar,” “Shadowland,” and “Endless 
Night,” were all beautifully sung and choreographed, 
only adding to the beautiful representation of the 
destruction of Simba’s kingdom and the peace of the 
paradise in which he hides. But a restless energy 
seemed to ?ll the seats as this new material washed over 
the audience. After all, when one goes to see a musical 
based on one of the most adored children’s movies of 
all time, one expects to experience the familiar, not be 
introduced to new material.
The lull dispersed, however, the moment the opening 
notes to Elton John and Tim Rice’s “Can You Feel the 
Love Tonight” ?oated out into the jungle night. The song 
proved to be one of the highlights of the musical, mostly 
due to the perfect comedic timing of Timon and Pumbaa 
during the introduction and the synchronous energy that 
emanated from the ensemble. 
From there, the score became the familiar themes that 
the audience was used to, and the show ended on a 
poignant note as Simba (Jelani Remy) ascended Pride 
Rock.
Perhaps the most powerful moment in the entire 
production was during the reprise of “He Lives in 
You,” when Simba looks into the water and sees his 
father staring back at him. The number was beautifully 
performed, not only by the actors but by the symphonic 
accompaniment as well, and the representation of 
Mufasa (L. Steven Taylor) that appeared in the stars was 
positively magical. 
At ?rst, ensemble members merely waved beautiful 
golden ?ags shaped like pieces of a face in time to 
the music. But then, as Simba realized that his father 
truly lived in him, a regal representation of Mufasa 
solidi?ed in the night sky, shining down on Simba and 
the audience. In that moment, it wasn’t just a musical 
version of the movie I watched with my brother when we 
were kids.
The Lion King represents the beautiful simplicity of 
childhood — and that representation, through the 
musical, will continue to touch the childhoods of many. 
Hollick encourages Carnegie Mellon students to make 
the trek down to see the show, saying that it’s an event 
that will teach everyone a powerful lesson.
“The Lion King will get their wheels turning intellectually 
and emotionally, relating to the characters. These are 
human issues and problems, and they’re rich, and CMU 
students should run down here to get a taste. It’ll enrich 
them; it will fuel their minds as they wrestle with the 
issues presented,” Hollick said.
