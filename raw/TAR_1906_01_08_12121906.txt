A Student’s View of 
the Honor System.
It is acknowledged by all but the 
most rabid anarchists that some form 
of government is necessary but at this 
point writing of opinion stops. The 
honor system is merely a form of 
school government in which power 
and responsibility is vested in the stu­
dents. Where the honor system is 
not in effect, government is carried 
on by the faculty. Many Carnegie stu­
dents think that faculty control such 
as prevails at theological seminaries 
is desirable.
Their objections to this system 
seem to be based on the supposition 
that their classmates are unfit for re­
sponsibility and incapable of self-gov-* 
ernment; although no student is will­
ing to come out and say that he, him­
self, is not to be trusted.
Many statesmen claim that every 
free people gets as good government 
as it deserves, and that no people is 
incapable of managing its own affairs; 
but they all agree that the least cap­
able of all peoples is the one that ac­
knowledges its own incompetence. If 
the classes of '08 and ’09 are willing to 
confess themselves worthless, the ques­
tion of the honor system is settled; 
but to expect such an acknowledgment 
is folly. Indeed, the doubting Thom­
ases would be the first to repudiate 
such a confession.
In various informal discussions, the 
matter has already been pretty well 
threshed out as far as the ethical side 
is concerned, but there is a very ma­
terial side to the question! All of the 
men at the schools are studying some 
engineering profession. Most of them 
hope to come to authority; probably a 
large part of them will in time be­
come persons of more or less import­
ance.
Now, there are several ways to land 
a fat job, but only one to keep it 
and that is to make good. When a 
one thousand dollar man gets a five

Hockey.
Boys Fast Getting Into Shape.—Game 
With Yale During Holidays Cer­
tain.
Tech will send forth a hockey team 
this winter which will be able to meet 
any of the large university contingents 
on an equal footing. An ante-season 
survey of that branch of Tech’s athle­
tics shows everything to be most fav­
orable, a large number of experienced 
candidates, a good schedule and best 
of all, good spirit by both players and 
student body at large.
Capt. Charles, Reisfar, Hammer and 
Mason of last year’s team are back,
JOHN CHARLES (CHUCK)
Captain and forward, Tech Hockey 
team. He is a native of Pittsburg, 
prepared at Pittsburg High School, 
, is 20 years of age, height 5 ft., 9 
inches; weight 140 lbs.
and with those men as a nucleus, and 
as has been said, a long list of can­
didates, it seems assured that we shall 
have a victorious season.
The Tartan has been unable to se­
cure the names of all the candidates, 
but we print herewith a few: Reisfar,

My Hobby.
By Prof. Geo. H. Follows.
.Some years ago the London “Punch” 
contained a cartoon drawn by that 
famous artist, Sir John Tenniel, rep­
resenting a prominent politician lock­
ed VO in the cell of a lunatic asy­
lum, astride of a wooden rocking 
horse named “Hobby.” The leader 
of his party, who had called, contem­
plated him sadly as he said, “What 
is the difference, Sir Charles, between 
a hobby horse and a real horse?” 
And the rider answered, “You can 
get off the real horse, my lord.”
It may be that the inference has 
some truth in it—-that a man some­
times finds it difficult to dismount 
from his favorite hobby; but that only 
proves that he has a pretty firm seat 
upon it. And is it not better to have 
a firm seat upon a hobby horse than 
to have no horse at all upon which 
to elevate oneself a trifle above those 
wlc merely stand around?
Tie man who has neither a real 
horse nor a hcbby horse—in other 
words, the man who, belonging to the 
majority, works for a modest salary, 
that some one else may ride—without 
even a hobby of his own to sport 
upon at will—is surely away behind 
his brother toiler who revels inde­
pendently during spare hours astride 
his favorite hobby.
“What I like best about a man,” 
said Field, “is his fads.” A man is 
never so entertaining as when, for­
getful of himself and of all who listen, 
he talks about his hobby. It is then 
he is seen and heard at his best. It 
matters not what the hobby may be; 
whether geology, to carry his mind 
back to live in the millions of years 
ago; or astronomy, to fill him with 
wonder at the awful immensity of 
space and the mathematical exact­
ness of the laws that govern the 
movements of the heavenly bodies; of 
zoology, accompanied perhaps with 
an attempt to discover the origin of 
man; or entomology, to make him

thousand dollar position, destiny 
reaches for an ax; and the man goes 
out of that office or the receiver in 
bankruptcy comes in.
Whatever the pull a man may ex­
pect to have, he can be sure that it 
will be useless unless he can do good 
work. Good work is necessarily in­
dependent work. A man who cannot 
get along without being watched can­
not watch others.
It is said every able-bodied man 
earns eight dollars per day but that 
most men pay six dollars to some 
one else to supervise them. Whether 
or not these figures are correct is not 
material; it is certain that the man 
who can work wlithout supervision is 
the man wiio draws the thick envelope 
on Saturday night.
It is also certain that the man who 
has to be watched by an instructor 
before Commencement will have to be 
watched by a boss later on. Every 
man gets what is coming to him and 
such a man will get an overseer; also 
a microscopic salary. All this may 
seem to have little to do with the 
honor system but it bears closely on 
"he subject. This institution affords 
valuable training in control of self and 
of others. It forces one to deal fairly 
ar>d to consider before acting.
After all, a man is not rated, or 
raid, for what he knows but for what 
!:e is. For. this reason, the honor 
ystem is as necessary to a school as 
a course in mathematics or chemistry.

Rodney Chester, who has been act­

with Columbia, Brown and Princeton 
at the St. Nicholas Rink, New York, 
during the holidays, and if C. T. S. is 
successful in defeating two or three 
of those big universities it would bring 
no little prestige to our school.
Yale makes their western trip dur­
ing the Christmas vacation and a 
game with them at the Gardens is
practically certain. The close race 
for victory that old Eli had last year 
has taught him not to look down on 
Tech with impunity, so when Tech vs. 
Yale is posted look out for a tight 
game.

wise about bugs and beetles; or 
microscopy, to reveal to him the ways 
of the “invisible” wonders of cre­
ation; or photography, or music, or 
painting, or even bass fishing—the 
subject makes no difference; if it is 
the man’s hobby he knows it, for 
himself, independently, from his own 
observation, and is an authority upon! 
it—for which reason alone, what he 
says about it is of interest and value 
to others.
A hobby engenders independence of 
thought and action, and with these 
come greater self-control and self- 
respect. An employe, whatever his 
business may be, is responsible to 
his employer, and his work must 
please that employer, otherwise his 
place will soon be filled by some one 
else. But while a man is working at 
hi* hobby he is his own employer— 
in business for himself; has no one to 
please but himself, lean .“take his 
own time about it,” is free to make 
as many experiments as he chooses, 
and is independent of all the world.
Some men make more of their hob­
bies than others, and progress fur­
ther—even make new and valuable 
discoveries. Some of these we call 
“cranks.” It has been said that a 
crank is a man whose hobby is not 
the same as your own. Perhaps it 
would be better to say that he has 
learned .more from his hobby than 
you have. Of course there are cranks 
and cranks, but thank heaven for 
them anyway—it is they that keep 
the world moving. Better to rank as 
a crank than live without a hobby.

The Education of an Engineer.
(Some extracts from an address by 
Mr. E. C. Andrus, N. G. S. E., appear­
ing in the National Engineer.)
In all branches of engineering sci­
ence, technical education is an ac­
knowledged and an increasing neces­
sity. Whatever the work may be, 
wrhether the running of an engine, the 
designing of a mechanical plant, or the 
laying out and superintendence of 
such greater wrorks of engineering 
as the construction of a railroad, or 
the bringing' of a city’s water supply 
from a distance of half a State, 
through mountains and under sewers, 
the great necessity is a man who 
knows how, and whose experience 
gives him the courage of accurate 
knowledge. ***** Whatever 
appertains to the public use, or as we 
more often hear them called, the pub­
lic utilities, are matters which engage 
the attention of the engineer. He 
stands for the conservation of energy, 
&c., represented by men, money, or 
machines. * * * The three quali­
ties which most usually mark the 
successful engineer are: Honor, broad­
mindedness, and strength of charac­
ter. '

A New Branch of Athletics.
We understand that Mr. Richard M. 
Guy (collegiate sporting editor of the 
Gazette Times), has already organized 
a series of Interscholastic Roller Polo 
games, to be held at the Traction 
Roller Skating Rink during the com­
ing winter. The following teams have 
been organized so far: Shadyside,
Pittsburg High, Pittsburg Academy, 
East Liberty Academy, Wilkinsburg 
High, and Allegheny High. The writer 
firmly believes that Tech could and 
should take up this altogether inter­
esting sport and enter the above 
league. That Ave could carry off more 
than our share of the honors goes 
without saying, for we undoubtedly 
have a fine lot of material from which 
to choose a polo team. Looking at it 
from a pecuniary standpoint, the 
writer is sure he can see in this op­
portunity an easy means whereby the 
treasurer of the Athletic Association 
can put the balance on the proper 
side of the ledger. That games be­
tween Tech and any of these other 
schools would draw A1 crowds is per­
fectly fair to assume, and if the Ath­
letic Association is half as wide awake 
as they are credited with being, Tech 
will have a Polo team this winter, be­
sides a fine “loving cup” for the “Tro­
phy Room” at the season’s end.

On Friday evening, Dec. 7, the Kar-

season, at the Conservatory of Music. 
Considering that it was the first of 
these affairs it was very well attended. 
Not all the gentlemen present were 
students of the schools which fact 
has caused some comment, but these 
gatherings will serve to bring together 
the students and their friends, and to 
allow the out-of-town students to be­
come acquainted with the young peo­
ple of Pittsburg.
About thirty couples attended and 
the music was furnished by the Todd-

played at about 1:30 a. m. The com­

HEEREN BROS. & CO. MWAH! JEWELERS and SILVERSMITHS,
We are the M
SMOKER 1911.
In the first place the committee in 
charge wishes to express sincere re­
gret that the entertainer engaged for- 
the evening failed to appear.
As it was the bulk of the entertain­
ment was thrown on the class mem­
bers and the mandolin club.
Mr. C. E. T. Edwards favored the 
committee and edified his auditors 
with a stirring declamation entitled, 
“The Spartan Gladiator,” for which he 
received prolonged applause. Mr. Ed­
wards is certainly an artist and his 
talent will no doubt grace the pro­
gram of any future function given by 
1911.
The mandolin club under Mr. 
Scheidlemeier rendered several selec­
tions and the individual members con­
tributed solos, all of which were great­
ly appreciated, as was their due. Each 
number was of an exceptional nature, 
calling for great technique and execu­
tion.
Without casting any disparagement 
on his associates the performance of 
Mr. Scheidlemeier was brilliant in the 
extreme. It is not often that one hears 
such a wealth of harmony and melody 
from one unaccompanied instrument 
as Mr. Scheidlemeier brought forth 
in his two well-selected solos.
Mr. Leo Schaedle, at the piano, en­
tertained with a number of popular 
airs, the familiar parts of which w?re 
whistled or sung by the guests. His 
work both as a soloist and an accom­
panist was worthy of great praise, and 
if applause is an indication of merit 
the reception tendered his efforts 
spoke volpumes.
Mr. B. V. Densmore gave an ex­
cruciatingly funny dialeect recitation 
and was accorded unstinted praise and 
applause.
The whole body sang “Heidelberg” 
and after a few more rounds of 
smokes the song “Alma Mater” was 
rendered with great feeling and the 
affair, the first smoker of the class of
1911, was over.
. In an incidental manner it may be 
said the gentlemen from 1910 gave the 
committee a scare by bursting into the
N BUILDING, PENN AVE. & 8TH
kers of the Carnegie Tec
affair without the preliminary cour­
tesy of paying the admission fee. They 
withheld the payment of same until 
Chairman Hess frightened them by 
his deep furrowed brow which plainly 
showed his disapproval. President 
Harley of 1911 made a neat speech of 
thanks to the assembled guests and in 
a few words thanked those who so 
ably assisted in making the affair a 
success.
-----------o-----------
There is a growing tendency on the 
part of some of the facetiously inclin­
ed members of 1911, to neglect to give 
some of the class officers the proper 
respect.
This feeling is manifested by the 
passing of remarks about the mar­
shal. For the benefit of those who in­
dulge in this ill-advised pastime a few 
words showing the necessity for and 
dignity of such an officer will not be 
amiss.
The constitution says: “The mar­
shall shall have charge of the room; 
see that it is comfortable in arrange­
ment and temperature. Le shall take 
a place conveniently hear the door to 
prevent any one leaving or entering 
while a member has the floor.”
It is absurd to think such an officer 
unnecessary because it would prevent 
“all things being done decently and in 
order” to have members entering or 
leaving when there is a question be­
fore the house, or particularly when 
a member is speaking. It is equally 
absurd to have anybody who has the 
desire to do so, get up and arrange 
the ventilation, etc. The officer is in 
strict keeping with correct parliamen­
tary procedure and is one demanding 
as much respect as any other.
It has been argued that the presence 
of the marshal is a constant rebuke, 
since everybody knows that common 
decency demands respectful attention 
when there is a speaker on the floor. 
Why then do we have such a large 
corps of police, if they are not as 
much of a servant of the orderly and 
lawabiding citizens as they are a 
menace to disorderly and law-violating 
persons?

1910 SOCIAL COMMITTEE.
President Skeehan has appointed 
the following men to serve as a so­
cial committee: Grote and Anderson 
from Section A, Swartz and Zimmer­
man from Section B, Lautenschlager 
and Sproul from Section C, Considine 
and Groetzinger from ¡Section D. 
Groetzinger will act as chairman. 
Probably the first thing that this

the 1910 smoker on its way to a bril­
liant success.

On next Saturday afternoon Direc­
tor and Mrs. Hammerschlag will give 
a reception at the school to the mem­
bers of the faculty.
Beginning next term a series of lec­
tures will be given to the students of 
the day schools by men prominent in 
the industrial world.
The Plebe class officers and section 
representatives met Professor Keller, 
Willett and Follows, on Thursday 
evening, Nov. 27. A discussion was 
held as to class rule and betterment.
We were very sorry to hear of the 
death of Henry Peebles’ father, and 
of Elmer Schumacher’s grandfather, 
during this last week and wish to ex­
press the sympathy felt by all the 
friends of both students.
Clara F. West has been appointed 
professor of home-making arts in the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School. 
Miss West is a native of Pittsburg 
but has lived in Europe for some 
years. She is an able lecturer upon 
economical and sociological subjects 
and holds an enviable position in the 
educational world.
We regret to report that Mr. Marion 
Steen, of the School of Applied De­
sign, is confined to the house with a 
broken knee cap, caused by being 
thrown out of his automobile last 
week. His mother was also very seri­
ously injured, but is reported to be 
on the road to recovery. Steen ex­
pects to be around again in about two 
weeks.
Mr. F. F. McIntosh, of Glen Osborne, 
Pa., has been appointed Assistant In­
structor in Departments of Physics 
and Metallurgy. Mr. McIntosh is a 
Harvard man having received the de­
gree of B. S. in mining and metallurgy 
in 1903, and later, in 1905, the degree 
of Met E. from the same university. 
He has been employed for some little 
time at the Bethlehem Steel Co.
Some talk has been heard outside 
of school circles relative to the forma­
tion of a hockey league, to consist of 
W. U. P., Tech and an ex-Scholastic 
team. It is understood that there will 
be no inter-scholastic league this year 
and that this new league is to take 
its place. The prospects for speedy 
games are bright as the ex-Scholastics 
will be able to put out a very strong 
team, and although W. U. P. has not 
done much in hockey lately ,will prob­
ably show up well.
PERSONALS.
.Sivitz—“Doesn’t ‘etc.’ count for
something on an examination paper?” 
Prof. Thayer—We will just allow 
this member to butt in. (Why did we 
laugh?)
Prof. Knox (in Mathematics) — 
“Now comes the lighthouse.”
Enter—Weick.
Prof. Lowe—“Jones, what’s the unit 
of work?”
Jones—“One day.”
From examination paper in Chem­
istry—“CO-2 is poisonous in air, but 
not in beer or soda.”
Prof. Lightcap—“What is that?” (re­
ferring to cone).
Chorus—“A dunce cap.”
One day Schumacher came to school 
without his collar. Now, to guard 
against a reoccurrence of the q^cident, 
he wears his collar as a part of the 
shirt.
Thurston has the best eye in the 
class. He can measure to two ten- 
thousandths on a scale graduated to 
thirty-seconds.
Mr. Mamatey (calling roll)—Weick? 
Voice in rear—VvTeick is outside 
combing his hair. There are some 
ladies in the hall.”
Potts, Turner, Rosenfeld and Smith ¦ 
took a spin through the park early 
Sunday morning in a very much ab­
breviated costum we are told.
Prof. Wagner—“Class, I want you to 
all secure copies of the ‘Autobiography 
of Franklin.’ ”
Gerould—“Who wrote that, Prof?” 
Prof. MacLucas—“Mr. Close, please 
give us your ideas on the honor sys­
tem.”
Close—“Of course—of course—-of 
course—.”
“Back to Nature.”—“Look Pleasant, 
please,” said the photographer to 
Schneider. Click! “It’s all over, sir. 
You may resume your (natural) ex-; 
pression.”
We hear that Provost, Tingley and 
Westbrook engaged in a pillow fight 
in an Ashtabula hotel during the wee 
sma’ hours. For results, inquire at 
the C. E. Dept.
Prof. Wagner—“Mr. Hudson, your 
writing is very poor.”
Mr. Hudson—“I write just like my 
father.”
Prof. W.—“Yes, you are a chip of 
the old block.”
Mr. Watson Bam of the Day Sec- One of Kohler’s problems—“If a 
ondary School, Woolwich Polytechnic house stands on a hill 36 deg. 12 min. 
Institute, Woolwich, England, who is 13 sec. from the horizontal, and the 
making a study of educational insti- distance from the front door to the 
tution, methods, etc., visited the side walk is 12 feet, how many men 
schools last week. are in the house?”
KNOCKS.
Smokers—a luxury to be paid for in 
advance. 1910 take notice.
Overheard new M. M. T. School— 
Come on girls get a skate on.
Mr. Lowe in Physics, Class C—That 
rifle bullet got down there in a hurry.
Richardson—Yes, I did not see it.
A few synonyms:
Energy—1911.
Courage—1911 football team.
Success—1911 smoker.
The following was handed in for 
publication:
“1911 has 1910 ‘skeen’-ed forty ways, 
but 1910 ‘Harley’ (hardly) thinks so.”
Over the Telephone—Central, I 
would like to speak to Professor Mac­
Lucas.
Operator—The Long Distance line 
is busy. I will call you.
Mr. Lowe in Physics, Class C—“This 
makes an awful lot of smoke although 
it is not Keeler’s coke.” This is a 
joke. Think it over. Would Mr. Lowe 
kindly explain where the laugh comes 
in.
There was a pretty exchange of 
courtesies between the members of 
1910 and 1911 after their financial dif­
ferences were settled. Each class and 
its presidents were cheered by the 
other class.
Last Wednesday in an attempt to 
get to school in a hurry one of the 
students of Class C, 1911, forgot to 
put on his coat, resulting that it was 
necessary to leave overcoat on during 
class sessions. Oh! What a joke on 
the Marshall.
His Mood—A member of the faculty 
of the University of Wisconsin tells 
of some amusing replies made by a 
pupil undergoing an examination in 
English. The candidate had been in­
structed to write out examples of the 
indicative, the subjunctive, the poten­
tial and the exclamatory moods. His 
efforts resulted as follows:
“I am endeavoring to pass an Eng­
lish examination. If I answer twenty 
questions I shall pass. If I answer 
twelve questions I may pass. God 
help me!”-----------o---------

SAY,
FELLOWS,
Let’s have a little heart to heart talk 
about those leather cushions. We 
believe that the only reason we 
haven’t received your order is because 
you have never seen our goods. We 
are not trying to sell you a cheap, 
gaudy affair. Never. We are trying 
to sell you a first-class article, to give 
you your money’s worth, because we 
want your future patronage. We’re 
young and ambitious, have visions of 
being a Montgomery Ward some time 
in the near future, sc we can’t afford 
to do you.
Give us a trial order, and we know 
that you won’t be disappointed. Here 
is a special offer: A swell hand-made
leather cusion, burnt in original 
“Tech” colors for five dollars, and 
your money BACK if you are not sat­
isfied. CAN YOU BEAT THAT?

PITTSBURG, PA.
“You see it makes me feel so 
queer.”
Take notice—If you can’t learn to 
Cook. Come to Tech.
What is the relationship between 
Miss Pfeil and Walter?
Please ask Miss Schwartz about 
father and relieve our minds.
Miss Nixon to Miss Stutz, the Eng­
lish teacher—Your trip done you good.
Mr. Sharpe—The people in Canada 
drink tea strong enough to float an
egg.
Wonder why Silvernail takes such 
long walks on the boulevard each 
evening?
Miss Alcorn has a definition for 
geometry that we think would be very 
hard to beat.
Miss Stutz (reading Dickens' Christ­
mas Carrol)—“Good afternoon, gentle­
men” (enter three fair damsels).
Prof. James—My fountain pen isn’t 
very good, Miss Schwartz.
You have to keep throwing it on the 
floor to make it write.
Miss Stutz in English—Clear con­
science, hope, faith, money—which is 
the greatest?
Voice from rear—Money!
Miss Shuman’s rule for addition is 
original and never fails. “First I start 
at the bottom and go up, get twisted, 
and then start at the top and go 
down.”
Someone suggested that Miss Stutz 
look into her cup of tea and see her 
fortune. Miss Stutz replied that she 
left her fortune in New York. Who— 
Which—or What is it?
Chasing a hat seems to be very 
good exercise, especially the Will'o- 
the wisp-sort. Current Topics wasn’t 
a bit interesting when such an excit­
ing event occurred right out the win­
dows.
Prof. James—Pupils, take notice, I 
am heating water not burning it.
‘ Someone please inform us why 
everyone goes around the M. M. C. S. 
calling Kitty, Kitty, Kitty, Kitty. 
Surely we aren’t all thinidng of a 
spinster future.
Last Saturday night the Civil Engi­
neering Society held their social event 
which took the popular form of a 
smoker and card party. It was held 
at the apartments of Dr. Hokanson on 
Neville street, and that it was a most 
enjoyable evening was the unanimous 
verdict of all the men present. In ad­
dition to the students and professors 
who are members of the society, the 
men were very fortunate in having as 
guests the following gentlemen: Di­
rector Hamerschlag; Mr. Smith, of the 
U. S. Topographical Survey, and his 
assistant, Mr. Kendall; Hon. H. K. 
Porter, Prof. Follows, and Prof. Mac- 
Lucas. A short characteristic address 
was made by the Director, followed 
by a few words of wrelcome and thanks 
to the invited guests by Dr. Hokan­
son. Mr. Smith gave a brief outline 
of the manner in which the work of 
the Topographical Survey is carried 
out. Mr. Porter gave a short talk on 
the effects of college sports in making 
better men of the students. After a 
general discussion 011 the merits of 
the dam in the hollow back of the 
schools, the evening’s enjoyment was 
brought to an appropriate end by three 
long cheers for Dr. Hokanson.

Prof. Lowe—“Mr. Seipp, what is 
work?”
Seipp—“I don’t know, I never did 
any.”
Prof. Lowe—“Well, give some defi­
nition.”
Seipp—“It’s a transfer—”
Interruption by another student— 
“Seipp’s got street car on the brain.”
In designing a Ferris wheel the 
other day, Prof. Thayer said we must 
count the weight of the people who 
x’ide in it; but he forgot to state that 
the people might also be loaded, thus 
giving a compressive stress in the 
off member similar to that caused by 
wind on the right.
