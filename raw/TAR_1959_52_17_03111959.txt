It’s Official: Skibo Goes!
July Razing to Hasten 
Hu nt Library Erec tion 
%A program for accelerating the construction of the new 
Hunt Library was announced today by Dr. J. C. Warner.
The original plan, which would have delayed construc­
tion of the library until after the completion of the new 
Activities center, was adopted to* 
speed completion of the building 
program. Under the new plan, it 
will be necessary to raze Tech’s 
World War I landmark, Skibo,
about July 1. This will mean that 
temporary replacements for Ski- 
bo’s facilities must be provided 
for the coming school year.
Food Services
After a careful study to de­
termine what substitutes could be 
provided, the following plan has 
been made:
1. An additional cafeteria line 
will be established in the More- 
wood recreation room. Additional 
faculty dining facilities will also 
be provided for in the faculty club 
and lunches will be served in the 
Mudge Graduate House.
2. Classes will be shifted from 
Web Hall to various other loca­
tions on campus, and the building 
will be provided with vending
machines and used as a student 
lounge and snack bar. It may be 
possible to provide sandwich fa­
cilities in Web Hall, however, this 
has not been definitely decided.
Studio Theatre
3. The Drama department’s 
studio theatres now located in 
skibo will be moved to another 
! location. This may involve the 
construction of a $40,000-$50,000 
I temporary building. The plans as 
to what definitely will be done 
concerning this problem have not 
been completely fixed at this date. 
The Tartan will announce these
plans as soon as they become j available.
A big advantage of this acceler- 
! ated program is that it will mean 
j that the campus will be torn up 
for almost a full year less. The
¦ new library will now be completed )at about the same time as the new 
| activities center, and both should
¦ be ready for use during the 1960- 
! 31 s-chool year, if not before.
More news of the development 
; program, including a complete 
description of thè new activities 
1 center building plans will be 
! published in next week’s Tartan.

Dr. Goodfellow 
Next Speaker
By Georgia White
Concluding the English Series 
Lectures, Professor Donald M. 
Goodfellow will discuss Shakes­
peare’s play “Love’s Labours 
Lost” Tuesday, March 17th in the 
Fine Arts The­
ater at 11:30 
a.m.
The play, 
which is not 
produced as 
often as the 
three or four 
famous Shake­
spearian come­
dies, will be 
p r e s e nted by 
the Tech drama 
Dr. Goodfellow department 
from March 21 to April 13.
“Love’s Labour Lost,” one of 
Shakespeare’s earliest plays has 
often been compared to a modern 
musical comedy. In it Shake­
speare light-heartedly deals with 
young love and at the same time 
satarizes some of the affectations 
of his day.
Plot
The plot involves a mythical 
King (of Navarre) and three of his 
couriers who take a vow to go 
into seclusion for three years to 
study. Women, they decide, will 
be excluded from their world. 
Complications arise, however, 
when they are forced to receive a 
French princess and three^of her 
ladies who come to Navarre on a 
diplomatic mission.
In reviewing the play. Pro­
fessor Goodfellow will discuss 
some of the humorous scenes of 
the play, the witty dialogue, re­
plete with puns and plays on 
words and a number of the amus­
ing characters.
Professor Goodfellow received 
his Bachelor of Arts degree from 
Colgate University and went to 
Harvard for his Master and Doc­
tor degrees. He joined the Car­
negie department in 1928.
John H. Cashman 
Appointed S yn S 
Technical Director
A sophomore industrial man­
agement major, John H. Cashman, 
is technical director of “Set ’Em 
Up Again,” this year’s Scotch and 
Soda production.
He has the responsibility of co­
ordinating and supervising all 
technical activities of the show, 
such as lights, sound, general set­
up of the theater, and set construc­
tion.
Experience
Jack, as he is called by his 
friends, worked on the lighting 
crew last year and in high school 
was with the Masque and Dagger 
Society for two years when they 
produced “Mr. Roberts” and “The 
Man Who Came To Dinner."
His theatrical experience has 
enabled him to make some new 
plans for the show this year. The 
seating arrangement will be im­
proved, the orchestra will be more 
ideally situated, and many new 
stage techniques will be effected. 
The most spectacular of these will 
include the use of flying sets— 
those that are dropped from the 
ceiling.
Positions Open
Several positions are still open 
for crew members on this year’s 
staff and even more are available 
for next year’s staff. Jack urges 
everyone interested to sign-up be­
cause, “You’ll have fun, meet peo­
ple, and learn many new things 
about the theater.”

HUSBANDS, ANYONE?
It has been alleged that coeds go to college for the sole purpose 
of finding husbands. This is, of course, an infamous canard, and 
I give fair warning that, small and spongy as I am, anybody 
who says such a dastardly thing when I am around had better 
be prepared for a sound thrashing!
Girls go to college for precisely the same reasons as men do: 
to broaden their horizons, to lengthen their vistas, to drink at 
the fount of wisdom. But if, by pure chance, while a girl is 
engaged in these meritorious pursuits, a likely looking husband 
should pop into view, why, what’s wrong with that? Eh? 
What’s wrong with that?
The question now arises, what should a girl look for in a 
husband? A great deal has been written on this subject. Some 
say character is most important, some say background, some 
say appearance, some say education. All are wrong.
The most important thing—bar none—in a husband is health. 
Though he be handsome as Apollo and rich as Croesus, what 
good is he if he just lies around all day accumulating bedsores?
The very first thing to do upon meeting a man is to make 
sure he is sound of wind and limb. Before he has a chance to 
sweet-talk you, slap a thermometer in his mouth, roll back his 
eyelids, yank out his tongue, rap his patella, palpate his thorax, 
ask him to straighten out a horseshoe with his teeth. If he 
fails these simple tests, phone for an ambulance and go on to 
the next prospect.
If, however, he turns out to be physically fit, proceed to the 
second most important requirement in a husband. I refer to 
a sense of humor.
A man who can’t take a joke is a man to be avoided. There 
are several simple tests to find out whether your prospect can 
take a joke or not. You can, for example, slash his tires. Or bum 
his "Mad” comics. Or steal his switchblade. Or turn loose his 
pet raccoon. Or shave his head.
After each of these good-natured pranks, laugh gaily and 
shout "April Fool!” If he replies, “But this is February nine­
teenth,” or something equally churlish, cross him off your list 
and give thanks you found out in time.
But if he laughs silverly and calls you "Little minx 1” put him 
to the next test. Find out whether he is kindly.
The quickest way to ascertain his kindliness is, of course, to 
look at the cigarette he smokes. Is it mild? Is it clement? Is it 
humane? Does it minister tenderly to the psyche? Does it 
coddle the synapses? Is it a good companion? Is it genial? Is it 
bright and friendly a»d full of dulcet pleasure from cockcrow 
till the heart of darkness?
Is it, in short, Philip Morris?
If Philip Morris it be, then clasp the man to youi'bosom with 
hoops of steel, for you may be sure that he is kindly as a sum­
mer breeze, kindly as a mother’s kiss, kindly to his very marrow.
And now, having found a man who is kindly and healthy and 
blessed with a sense of humor, the only thing that remains is to 
make sure he will always earn a handsome living. That, fortu­
nately, is easy. Just enroll him in engineering. «i»«,. slui»*.

^Tech's Place In Education
Students Give Views 
On President’s Article
By Leila Moore -
President Warner’s discussion of the goals of higher edu­
cation at Carnegie Tech, which was published in last week’s 
®*Tartan, has received varied comments from a few of Tech’s
campus personalities, ?--------------------------—------------------
A member of the College of 
Fine Arts had this to say:
“I thoroughly agree with the
old philosophy of good higher ed­
ucation as stated by Dr. Warner. 
It also appears to me that Car­
negie Tech is honestly striving in 
this direction.
Question’s Statement
• “However, speaking from my 
own experience, I seriously ques­
tion his statement that all colleges 
and departments of Tech are pro­
viding a ‘solid core of liberal stu­
dies in the humanities and social 
sciences for students in all pro­
fessional fields.’ I speak of the 
Fine Arts college in particular. In 
my own department of Fine Arts, 
Thought and Expression, Arts and 
Civilization, and Introductory 
^Psychology are the only three 
liberal arts courses listed on the 
student’s schedule throughout his 
entire undergraduate curriculum. 
Moreover, these courses are re­
quired. There is no such thing as 
an ‘elective’ in my department; 
every semester our schedules are 
handed to us, already made out. 
It is true that any student may 
take an ‘elective’ course as an 
overload (with the approval of 
^the department head), but this 
exception is not in line with the 
statement of Dr. Warner which 
I quoted earlier.”
Bob Cleveland, senior in the 
Printing Management department, 
had this comment to make: 
“President Warner’s statement 
is a summation of the highest 
factors which lead me to feel an 
intense pride in being a part of 
Carnegie Tech. I am sure that my 
^pride will continue to grow as 
*ong as President Warner’s state­
ment remains a definition of 
existing conditions, rather than a 
theoretical ideal.”
Truth and Merit 
The following statement comes 
from a student in Magaret Mor­
rison college:
“Undoubtedly, D r. Warner’s 
statement, regarding Tech’s pro­
press in the last 25 years toward 
^becoming a university which pro­
vides a good professiooal and lib­
eral education has a great deal 
of truth and merit. In the three 
and a half years I have been at 
Tech, I have seen many changes 
for the good, especially in the 
General Studies Department. Two 
of tense changes are a broadened 
choice of electives available and 
the addition of the technical writ­
ing major. Certainly the latter is 
^an indication of an awareness on 
"the part of the faculty of the 
growing opportunities for women 
in the scientific and writing fields.
‘However, the improvement of 
curriculum and the striving for 
better teaching is and will con-
Get WILDROOT

tinue to be in vain if something 
is not done to foster an intellect­
ual atmosphere among the stu­
dents. Unfortunately, such a thing 
does not exist to any degree on 
this campus except in the college 
of Fine Arts. There are very few 
students of engineering, home ec­
onomics, or English who are truly 
devoted to their studies — who 
have a sense of honor about 
learning through their own ef­
forts. Instead, it is all important 
to get fair to good grades, and 
thus be in the running for a high 
paying job after graduation.
‘How should this problem be 
tackled? is a difficult question to 
answer. One thing is certain — it 
will have to be done through the
combined efforts or students and 
faculty. There must be a closer 
association of student and profes­
sor in and out of the classroom. 
There must be better communica­
tion between the two — a com­
munication of not only facts and 
ideas, but also of attitudes and 
feelings. When Tech students 
truly become a part of the intel­
lectual society that a college or
university should be, then will
Carnegie Tech be able to move 
toward the realization of Dr. 
Warner’s ideas of the kind of 
school that will provide the best 
of higher education.”'
Limitations 
Dick Clemm, senior in Printing 
Management and Editor of the 
Thistle, made this comment: 
“With an educational stand as
stated by President Warner, Car­
negie Tech should have no trouble 
attaining the highest station in 
education other than the mention­
ed limitations imposed by re­
sources. It is my opinion that 
those who have received the 
benefits of such an educational 
program should assume the re­
sponsibility of reducing these 
limitations.”

Childhood
In the midst of our concern (complacent as it may be) 
ior the growth of Russian power, the hydrogen bomb, inter­
planetary travel, etc., it is pleasant to pause and reflect occa­
sionally on the carefree days of our childhood, whether as it 
was, or as we would like to imagine it. .Although psycholo­
gists would probably term this an escape mechanism, is there 
any more enjoyable frustration-reliever (“tranquilizer” in 
the modern idiom) than leafing through an old scrap book 
or browsing again in the books you read as a child? A. A. 
Milne (as well as James M. Barrie, Thorton Burgess, Lewis 
Carroll, etc.) has, in his books of verse and in the Winnie-the- 
Pooh stories, provided the world of the very young with some 
of the most delightful tales ever written. Christopher Robin 
is Milne’s son and Winnie-the-Pooh (Edward Bear), Piglet, 
Rabbit, Owl, Kanga, Little Roo, and Eeyore were his child­
hood “playmates.” Unfortunately, during World War II when 
Christopher Robin was a pilot with the R. A. F., the Milne 
home in London was bombed by the enemy forces and all 
of the characters of these stories were destroyed. Here is a 
sample from Non: We Are Six of Milne’s verse.
Us Two
Wherever I am, there’s always Pooh,
There’s always Pooh and Me.
‘Whatever I do, he wants to do,
“Where are you going today?” says Pooh:
“Well, that’s very odd ’cos I was too.
Let’s go together,” says Pooh, says he.
“Let’s go together,” says Pooh.
“What’s twice eleven?” I said to Pooh.
(“Twice what?” said Pooh to me.)
“I think it ought to be twenty-two.”
“Just what I think myself,” said Pooh.
It wTasn’t an easy su mto do,
But that’s what it is,” said Pooh, said he.
“That’s what it is,” said Pooh.
“Let’s look for dragons,” I said to Pooh 
“Yes. let’s,” said Pooh to Me.
We crossed the rive and found a few—
“Yes, those are dragons all right,” said Pooh 
“As soon as I saw their beaks I knew.
That’s what they are,”.said Pooh, said he.
“That’s what they are,” said Pooh.
“Let’s frighten the dragons,” I said to Pooh,
“That’s right,” said Pooh to Me.
“I'm not afraid,” I said to Pooh, - 
And I held his paw and I shouted “Shoo!
Silly old dragons'”—and off they flew.
“I wasn’t afraid,” said Pooh, said he,
“I’m never afraid with }rou.”
So wherever I am, there’s always Pooh,
There’s always Pooh and Me.
“What would I do?” I said to Pooh,
“If it wasn’t for you,” and Pooh said: “True,
It isn’t much fun for One, but Two 
Can stick together,” says Pooh, says he.
“That’s how it is,” says Pooh.

Editors, the Tartan:
Your editorial Moscow Circus 
is on such a low level of editorial 
comment that I question whether 
more than perhaps half an hour 
was spent on it. No editor who 
felt any responsibility to his read­
ers would permit such trash to 
reach the printer.
To refer to the parading bombs 
and missiles in Moscow as asinine 
demonstrates a lack of under­
standing as to the effect this “asi­
nine spectacle” has on the whole 
world. To compare this hugely 
significant event in any manner 
whatsoever to Spring Carnival is 
to stretch the meaning of literary 
license.
To use as many colored words 
in an editorial as the Tartan edi­
tors have points out the inability 
of the same editors to express 
themselves clearly in a more ac­
ceptable manner and detracts 
from the infinitessimal amount of 
truth that there is in their editor­
ial.

We would like to correct a misconception which appeartw 
in your recent editorial concerning Greek Sing. As the editor 
should have known, had she consulted any one of the Greek
Sing directors, the program was
Blenheim
Editors, The Tartan:
As a private citizen, I applaud 
the sentiments of the Blenheim 
eoitorial entitled “Eisenhower 
Tragedy” (Tartan, February 25, 
1959), but as a member of the 
English Department I wish to 
compliment the writer upon a 
coherent and persuasive essay. 
The precision of language and 
range of vocabulary, the effective 
use of repetion for emphasis, and 
the careful development of ideas 
are all praiseworthy. A few mech­
anical quibblings aside, this is the 
kind of writing we all hope our 
students will do in their upper- 
class years, and it is heartening 
to see a good example so prom­
inently in view.
I am sure I am not alone in 
wishing to commend publicly the 
writing standard so admirably set 
by this Tartan essay.

arranged by the groups drawing 
for positions. We, too, felt that 
such a plan would “intersperse 
the well-trained, much practiced 
groups with those teams compet­
ing in Sing simply for the sake of 
entering the competition.” Thii 
four out of five of last j^ear’s win­
ners appeared in the last section 
of the program was purely coinci­
dental. That chance is taken when 
such a system is used.
Ticket Distribution 
The same editorial states, “there 
still remain many questions about 
how the distribution of tickets 
was handled.” The Tartan men­
tions only one of these questions. 
What are the others? We are will­
ing to answer any specific ques­
tions the Tartan may have.
In answer to the statement that 
“Greek Sing is a Greek weekend 
and should be kept that way,” we 
would like to ask “why?” What is 
the difference between “extremely 
interested administration and fac­
ulty members” (who, the Tartan 
admits, should be permitted to at­
tend) and extremely interested 
independents of Carnegie Tech? 
The answer we feel, lies rather in 
making it possible for all inter­
ested persons to attend, either by 
obtaining a larger performance 
hall or by presenting Greek Sing 
on two consecutive nights.

(Editor’s Note: The Tartan
wishes to thank the co-chairmen 
of Greek Sing for correcting the 
I “misconception” about the ar­
rangement of the Greek Sing 
; program. The Tartan would like 
| to suggest that if in the future, 
the “purely coincidental” results 
| of the drawing for places in 
program arrange in order the 
previous year’s winners — second 
| place sorority, second place fra- 
| ternity, first place sorority, first 
place fraternity — in one section 
of the program, some revision in 
the program be made, with, of 
course, the permission of the 
Greek Sing directors.
The Tartan still does have un­
answered questions about the dis­
tribution of tickets to state 
Why were independents asked 
openly in the middle of the week 
preceding Sing if they wanted 
any tickets for Sing, when, dur­
ing those few days, fraternity and 
sorority members were desper­
ately looking for tickets? Why 
were tickets given to people who 
were not connected with Greek 
Sing and ioho possibly would not 
attend the performances, when 
was admitted that numerically 
there were not enough tickets 
even for the Greeks to begin 
with?
To answer the question why 
Greek Sing should be kept a 
Greek activity the Tartan asks 
merely why should an indepen­
dent who has done nothing to­
ward Greek Sing' be given a tick­
et to Sing when some fraternity 
or sorority member whose hov 
is competing cannot gain admis­
sion for his date? The ideal situ­
ation would be, of course, to hold 
Greek Sing in an auditorium large 
enough to permit all Greeks and 
interested independents, faculty, 
and administration members to 
attend. Until this can be achieved, 
I however, Greek Sing, to repeat, 
should be kept Greek Sing.

iZode Of Conduct 
States Obligation 
Of the Prisoner
By Andy Blaskovich
Point III of the Code states the 
relationship of the individual as 
a prisoner and his captor.
III. If I am captured, I will con- 
t tinue to resist by all means
possible. I will make every 
effort to escape and aid oth­
ers to escape. I will accept 
neither parole nor special 
favoi's from the enemy.
In discussing this point, it will 
probably be best to break it down 
sentence by sentence. “I will con­
tinue to resist by all means avail­
able.” The success of one’s efforts 
to resist as a captive can be mea­
sured in the individual’s ability 
*J»d resourcefulness. Luck may 
also be included, since in every 
attempt one must be afforded op­
portunities of which he must take 
advantage. But to attempt some 
means of resistance without any of 
the above attributes would be fool­
hardy and is not intended by the 
Code.
Every Effort
“I will make every effort to 
escape . . .” All the points stated 
fpi the above paragraph also hold 
true to this “paraphrase.” At this 
point, it Only needs to be stated 
that if the opportunity to escape 
presents itself, one must take it. 
Failure to do so is failure to ful- 
fj'l this requirement of ~the Code.
What happens if the enemy re­
taliates following either an escape 
(or an escape attempt with re­
prisals against one’s fellow pris­
oners? The communists did this

actions. But the individual should 
not feel guilty. The Code implic­
itly slates “. . . escape.” Even un­
der the Geneva agreement the 
prisoner has a right to escape.
But the captor is wrong, in that 
Article 82 states “. . . captors are 
forb’dden to punish a prisoner for 
an action that his own are not 
forbidden to do when captured.’ 
Wouid a communist punish a fel­
low communist for escaping from 
a prison camp? Obviously not. 
The threat is a weapon of war. 
Therefore the enemy may employ 
it if he can influence the prisoner 
in any way.
Special Favors
Paroles and special favors are 
also out of the question since they 
imply a closer than normal rela­
tionship between the captive and 
the captor. They are also forbid­
den by the Code. If one accepts 
the threat mentioned above as a 
means to neglect escape, he is 
actually making an agreement 
with the enemy.
A prisoner must remember that

All the Way 
Be Gung Ho
No doubt everyone has often 
heard the term “gung ho” ap- 
applied to one or more of the ca­
dets.
Just what does “gung ho” im­
ply? One thing it certainly does 
not imply is hypocracy just for 
the sake of getting a good grade. 
This is sometimes thought when 
the phrase is used.
Marine Origin
The term “gung ho” is usually

attributed to the Marines and is 
popularly construed as “all the 
way.”
Few have a desire to go all the 
way and become professional mil­
itary men although they may have 
had such visions as youngsters.
Personal Wants 
What’s w'rong with that? Can 
a person help it if he is attracted 
to one thing and not to another? 
That’s all it is—a simple case of
what a person wants. Everyone is 
not an engineer at Carnegie Tech 
for this simple reason.
There’s nothing wrong with a 
man who works at something he 
likes and enjoys. On the contrary, 
he should be admired for finding 
something in which he can put 
his useful work.
Among the cadets, enthusiasm 
for the Army is at best tolerated 
and seldorrr praised. Perhaps if 
one can understand the reason for 
the enthusiasm one can under­
stand the interest.
There’s no place in the middle 
for being “gung ho.” If anyone 
is going to be “gung ho,” he 
should be “gung ho.” Anyone 
who doesn’t have the heart for it 
shouldn’t criticize others for it 
and shouldn’t try it himself be­
cause the one key word will be 
missing—enthusiasm.

could benefit from it. It is im­
portant therefore, that the pris­
oner makes no concession what so 
ever with the enemv.

2...TRADITIONAL REWARDS
In every organization, greater responsibilities mean 
greater rewards. The traditional prestige of an Army 
officer is matched by material advantages. A second 
lieutenant earns a minimum of $355.88 per month— 
plus substantial fringe benefits. Think you might want 
to marry soon after graduation? An officer’s salary can
make things a great deal easier for a married couple 
just starting out. What's more, an Army officer is en­
titled to take his dependents with him, wherever pos­
sible. Imagine sharing the fun of travel with your wife 
—in the United States or foreign countries like France, 
Germany or Japan.

Many more applied. Not aU were accepted. 
In more than 200 U. S. colleges, 14,436 college 
sophomores met the high standards set. These 
students were selected to continue officer 
training in the advanced R.O.T.C. course. 
Why did each of these young men decide 
that he would benefit by fulfilling his military 
obligation as an Army officer? Here are two 
important reasons. Perhaps they’ll help you 
make your decision.
1 ...TRADITIONAL RESPONSIBILITIES
As an Army officer, you’re in command of men. More 
men than the number supervised by many civilian ex­
ecutives years older than yourself. To meet your com­
mand responsibilities, you employ a great many of the 
LEADERSHIP principles acquired in advanced R.O.T.C. 
training. And your executive potential develops while
you gather LEADERSHIP experience. The executive 
ability you gain as an Army officer will be an important 
advantage in any civilian career. That’s why employment 
directors often prefer men who have served as com­
missioned officers. These men have already proven their 
capacity to handle executive responsibility.

Obelisks Repeat As 
Bowling Champs
Last Saturday DU, Sigma Nu, 
Printing Management, and the 
Obelisks bowled for the school 
championship. The position in 
which each placed was deter­
mined by team total points for the 
three games—the highest placing 
first; the lowest, fourth.
The defending champs, Obelisk, 
turned in another fine perform­
ance to become school champs for 
the second straight year. Their 
superiority can be credited to fine 
team work. This fact stems from 
them having the highest three 
game team series this year, 2498 
pins, although their player with 
the highest average came in sev- 
in the school.
However, the top boylers of the 
season, Dave Harvey and Jim 
Swisher, played on teams which 
finished second in their leagues, 
and were, therefore, in the play­
offs. Dave nosed out Swisher in 
total pins by one during the regu­
lar play, and thus became this 
year’s MVP.
The person who shot the high 
three game series this season had 
practically no competition for the 
honor. Bob Reber, for the three 
games bowled 639, while IraSha- 
piro came in second with 580, and 
Walt O’Shannon third with 568.
The highest single game bowled 
this year was by Fred Smith who 
had 235. Two fellows came close 
with 233’s. This year’s top eight

Final standings in intramural 
basketball were determined this 
week as regular play cafne to an 
end. Only, one of the ten teams 
that will enter the play-offs was 
not a pre-season choice to be in 
the tournament.
GSIA, led by Petran, who 
jumped from 11th to 7th in school 
scoring, will be the Cinderella 
team in the play-offs. They gain­
ed this distinction by finishing 
second in the Hook Shot League.
Playoffs start this week with 
the favorites, the Englishmen, in 
a bit of trouble. Two of their 
starters will be out of action for 
the remainder of the season be­
cause of leg inurijes, Sam Larson 
has a twisted knee; and their 
leading scorer, Jack Mehalko, has 
torn ligaments in his ankle.
Other seeded teams are the

W & J Falls
The Carnegie Tech Rifle Team 
beat W. & J. into submission, 
1432-1420, on the neutral Frazier- 
Simplex range last week, aveng­
ing the Tartan’s only setback this 
year, and clinching the Greater 
Pittsburgh Intercollegiate Rifle 
League trophy for the 3rd time in 
four years.
Barry Trew, W. & J.’s three 
time time All-American, took 
high honors with a 291, but Tech’s 
stellar array could not be denied. 
With Glunt’s 285 and Thunborg’s 
284 to start off the match, the 
Tartans were never behind.
Then Polansky with a 290, Jen­
kins with a 289, and Burtner with 
a 284, put the final crushing 
points to- the score.
Polansky Stars
The Tartan rifle, team won the 
National Rifle Assn. sectional 
tournament by edging the host 
University of Maryland team 1423 
to 1417.
Tech’s second team took third 
place with a 1391 total followed 
by Lehigh, North Carolina State, 
Drexel, and Penn State.
Tech’s All-American Vic Polan­
sky was the individual high scor­
er in the tournament with a 290 
score. It was the second time in 
three years that Vic has won this 
individual championship.
Both Tech’s Number 1 and 
Number 2 teams will compete for 
the National Championship later 
on this month. Tech is the de­
fending national champ and is 
favored to retain the title this 
year.
Polansky has averaged in the 
high 280’s again this season and 
is a sure bet to retain his All 
American position.
Intramural
Highlites
Four bridge teams will meet 
this week in the semi-final round. 
The Four Jokers are favored to 
defeat the defending champs, the 
Whiz Kids, while the Grad Jacks 
are favored over the SAE. The 
winners will meet in the finals 
next week, while the losers will 
compete in the consolation match.
At the end of the week, the 
four highest scoring rifle teams 
will shoot for the top four spots 
in the rankings.
Foul shooting ends tomorrow 
night. ATO, KS, and the English­
men are the three favorites to be 
the shooting champs.
There are many titles at stake 
in this year’s intramural wrest­
ling. Championship matches will 
be held tonight and Friday eve­
ning.
Up-to-date point standings 
show ATO first with 21 points, 
SAE second with 17, and Obelisk 
third with 16. The Met Grads and 
Beta Sigs are tied for fourth with 
10 apiece.
Wittman Stars 
In AAU Meet
Last Saturday in the Allegheny 
Mountain Ass’n Junior AAU 
championships, two Tech runners 
brought home the bacon. Compet­
ing in a field which included Pitt, 
West Virginia, Slippery Rock 
Youngstown, and all the Pit^.* 
burgh high schools, Tech’s Bill 
Wittman ran away with the mile 
in 4:32, and came back an hour 
later to place third in the long 
two mile run.
Dick Hamilton of Tech placed 
second in the two mile in 10:09 
behind Joe Thomas, Pennsylvania 
State schoolboy mile and cross 
country champion who broke the 
record to win.
In his mile victory, Wittmsi/ 
trailed at the end of a quarter, 
but at the half he took charge and 
from then on it was all his race. 
His time was only 4 seconds off 
the old record of 4:28.2.
Hamilton and Thomas exchang­
ed leads in the two mile and ran 
neck and neck for a mile and a 
half; then Thomas began to open 
up a lead and went on to win, 
setting a new record of 9:56.
Looking forward to the coming 
dual meet season, these perform­
ances are very encouraging. The 
times in both the mile and two- 
mile were faster than the times 
posted by either Wittman or 
Hamilton at the post esason tri­
state championships last spring.
With the start of the dual rrietet 
season still a month away, Tech 
should continue to dominate the 
distance events in area track tb:" 
year.
Eric Ottervik, Tech’s number 
one distance man and 2 mile 
champion in the tri-state meet 
last season was ineligible to run 
in the Junior AAU meet this 
year but should continue to be 
the big threat in distance running 
this year.

Chevy stops quickest... goes farthest on a gallon !
Chevy showed the hest brakes of the 
leading low-priced three in a test of 
repeated stops at highway speeds con­
ducted and certified by NASCAR*. 
Chevy also won over the other two in 
a NASCAR economy run—with the 
highest gas mileage for 6’s and V8’s at 
cruising speeds of just over 55 miles 
an hour.
Here’s a car that knows how to get 
the most out of a gallon. And it’s the 
only car in its field to bring you 
hydraulic valve lifters in all popular 
engines—6 and V8. This means 
smoother, quieter performance for you.
There are many other advances just 
as fundamental as the efficiency of 
Chevrolet’s engines and the depend­
ability of its new brakes (with more lin­
ing area than any other low-priced car).

Participation Awards 
For Active Leaders
By Ron Craig-
Each year a group of students from evening school re­
ceives recognition for participation in extra-curricular activi­
ties at the banquet where Insignia keys are awarded.
Many students do not realize how easy it is to earn the 20
?points required, while others stopCouncil Needs 
New Members
^ By Mary Alice Peterson
Evening Student Council peri­
odically appeals to students to be­
come workers and members of 
Council. At present this need 
should be given serious considera­
tion.
The membership consists of ten 
men and three women. Two men 
will graduate, leaving representa­
tion of approximately 1600 stu­
dents to the remaining members. 
Where are two potential male and 
five female workers who have ex­
pressed interest. However, this is 
not enough to build a representa­
tive group to handle all the de­
tails and services to the students.
Council Activities
What does Council do besides 
hold meetings? They have a num­
ber of responsibilities including 
publication of the Hand Book; 
planning, organizing, and con­
ducting all social functions, in­
cluding the Christmas Assembly 
Program; and.publicizing items of 
interest to evening students in the 
“Plaid.” Aside from this, Council 
represents the interests of evening 
students and cooperates wtih the 
administration to accomplish the 
desired results.
What compensation does a 
member or worker receive? Coun­
cil members benefit by the ex- 
®>orience of association and lead­
ership of with others. Tokens of 
appreciation is expressed in the 
Insignia Awards received through 
points earned by participation in 
the work of social events, publi­
cations, etc.
Valuable
Although work is involved as 
well as time which is particularly 
valuable to evening students, this 
is an outlet which provides re­
laxation and enjoyment.
How can you become a mem­
ber? Join Council at their regu­
lar monthly meetings at Carnegie 
Union, Conference* Room A, 2 p.m. 
They are held the first Sunday of 
each month.
The next meeting is March 1, 
followed by a meeting April 5. 
Any Council member can tell you 
more about the activities and 
how you can join the workers and 
^members in this important as­
signment. ___________________

miss plenty, if you check only the big ones.
Your big opportunity may be with the small, 
select group of graduates—just 20—that we plan to 
place at Hagan this year.
Hagan isn’t an industrial giant, yet 98 of the 100 
largest industrial firms in America, and 40 of the 
60 largest utilities are among the thousands of cus­
tomers lhat use our products and services.

Controls and Instrumentation. We design, man­
ufacture and sell automatic control and instrumen­
tation systems for use in power plants, steel mills, 
aeronautical testing facilities, and in many basic 
process control applications—including electronic 
instrumentation.
Industrial Water Service. Our Hall Service Engi­
neers help thousands of industrial plants prevent 
costly water troubles, by on-the-job consultation 
and service for every type of industrial water prob­
lem—from procurement to disposal.
Calgon and Hagan Chemicals. Calgon phosphate 
compounds, and Calgonite detergents—including 
popular household versions of each—are among the 
many chemicals we process and sell for water treat­
ment in utility, industrial, municipal and household 
water systems.
