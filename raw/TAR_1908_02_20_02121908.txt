WESTMINSTER LOSES TO TECH.
On Friday evening, Feb. 7, the Tech Basket-Ball of this game shows clearly that we have no cause
Team won from the Westminster team of New to fear Wup on the 21st, as their second battle with
Wilmington, Pa. The game was fasit throughout 
and Tech showed up wonderfully well, the steady 
practice which has been held three times a week 
having developed team work and speed.. It was 
feared that the loss of Ralston would seriously crip­
ple the team, but Harrison has proven himself a 
first rate player and will be able to go as fast as 
Ralston. The team, although outweighed, played 
a far superior game to that of the visitors, and the 
passing and shooting was carried out with mechan­
ical perfection. Neudorfer and Leety played »the 
same steady game as usual and Lytle and Buhl 
showed the good effect of hard training. The result
SENATOR DOLLIVER OF IOWA, WILL ADDRESS 
TECH MEN.
Senators Dolliver of Iowa, and Carter of Mon­
tana, Representatives Fasset and Burke of New York 
and Pennsylvania, and Judge Buffington of the U. S. 
Circuit Court, will form the party of distinguished 
guests who will visit the schools this morning. Sen­
ator Dolliver who has come to be a national figure 
will address the students in the assembly room at 
12.20 P. M. His topic will be “The Influence of the 
Engineer in Civil Life.”
Tech will be one of the fiercest of the season. Line­
up and score:

PROGRESS OF THE THISTLE.
The Thistle Board has started work on the year 
book and has announced some of the plans. It is 
proposed to publish an individual picture of every 
member of the ,Senior class with a short sketch con­
cerning him, similar to those pictures of the Faculty 
which appeared in the first Thistle. If the members 
of the Senior class go together a special low rate 
can be secured on pictures that will enable each 
man to buy his at minimum cost. It is hoped that 
some action will be taken by the Senior class presi- 
ident, Mr. Henderson, this week regarding this mat­
ter.

- Prof. Alaux’s mother died before he sailed for 
Paris. He then decided not to go home and is with 
us again. The students deeply regret his loss and 
beg to offer their condolence in his hour of grief.
The faculty of the Architectural Department 
walked into Prof. Mc-Goodwin's office one day re­
cently to find that some of the students had formed 
an art jury and proceeded to pass judgment on the 
work done by the faculty and exhibited in the li­
brary. In the estimation of the jury— the showing 
made was especially commendable.
Prof. Alaux’s sketches in Seville received a tin 
medal. Of our Prof. Hornbostel’s elevation of the 
proposed administration building, mention was made, 
the same being awarded Prof. Goodwin’s drawings.
Mr. Janssen’s work received favorable comment, 
but for some unexplained reason Mr. Weber’s mag­
nificent charcoal drawings were placed “Hors de 
Concours.”
The faculty took it all good naturedly and the
act created much fun for a short time. All students
are cordially invited to view the exhibition, which
will continue for one week.
It is expected every man in the Atelier will at­
tend the Shindig to be given in honor of our Patron 
on Tuesday evening, February 18th. The committee 
have arranged “something doing every minute,” in­
cluding a sensational boxing match between “Reds” 
Jones and “Dutch” McCarthy, the quartette will 
render sweet melodies, Alexander, the noted pianist,
will also perform. There will be lots to---------eat.
Sweaters, peg-tops and • bull-dog # shoes will be in 
order.
Miss H—y was heard to bet a certain student 
she would have a better “Triumphal Arch” than he.
Wonder if she is depending on T. P. to render 
for her.
It is to be regietted, indeed, that those students 
chosen by the respective classes to prepare the 
“Thistle” could not arrive at some congenial con­
clusion and as a consequence there will not be a 
school publication this year.
Boys, get busy. Our new “draughtslady” is the 
real thing. Gne can readily see the horses on her 
“Triumphal Arch” are not mice.
King, to Miss Haney—“I was just down in the
foundry to see them casting.”
John Slovinec (butting in)—“Casting what? 
Shadows?”
Brandy certainly is an artist at posters. Have 
you seen the Hockey Notice on the bulletin boards?
Hockey, Tech vs. W. U. P., Thursday, February 
20th. The boys from this department are planning 
to attend in a body and root like---------for C. T. S.
Robling is now with Messrs. Janssen & Abbott. 
Good luck and best wishes, Ollie.
The boys had a fine time last Sunday evening— 
six Moresque Fountains — England’s looked more 
like a harem.
Brandy Smith is now with Mr. Shallentrager, 
architect.
Fellows, when you have a sky to paint, ask Mr. 
Campbell to help you.
In regard to teaching Sunday School, Brandy 
Smith says it’s a matter of business, that it pays 
an architect to get acquainted.
That remarkable Snake Eater will give an exhi­
bition at the Shindig. The act is worth coming a 
long way to see. Will be found just to the left of 
the big tent. It’s gratis, too.
The Messrs. Bruton and Rigamont are two ad­
ditional representatives elected to the Athletic Com­
mittee and will attend the meeting of that body on 
Wednesday evening.
The basket-ball team is now striking its proper 
gait. That was an excellent exhibition Friday even­
ing and W. U. P. are doomed to the same fate.

PLEBES
There are about a half-dozen members of the 
class whose attention should be called rather forci­
bly to something that has been happening frequently 
of late. About fifteen minutes after nine, some of 
our self-important and sleepy-eyed friends arrive, 
and finding the lecture hall door locked, proceed to 
make it next to impossible for those on the inside 
to hear what is being said, by hammering on the 
door. More than once the lecturer has had to stop 
and request that the person or persons be admitted 
in self-defense. Our friends will say, “Oh, that is 
just what I wanted, to get in, and what’s more, since 
it worked this time, I can come at any old time and 
get in.” To say the least, it is always annoying to 
everyone in the room, and discourteous to the lec­
turer. It is easy enough to stop, for let it be known 
that the next fellow that -does it will get a ducking, 
and the big-headed “its” who think the lecture must 
stop for them, are not the ones who would dare to 
risk anything of that sort. It will save some one 
lots of trouble if it is cut out, without anything 
more being said about it.
Plebe basket-ball has reached the stage to make 
us sit up and take notice. There is certainly much 
room for improvement on the present state of af­
fairs. Manager Bootes and Capt. Barrett have 
done their best to arouse interest among the fel­
lows, but not enough have come out to make the
affair really interesting. Take an interest and have 
a try so as to make the other fellow work hard to 
keep his place, and by the end of the season, 1910 
will have a team to be proud of. We believe that 
there are a great number of old hands at the game, 
who are simply too modest to show what they can 
do. In a time of need like the present, any one 
who has ever played the game at all, should get 
bysy and join the squad. The team practices at the 
Duquesne Garden Amphitheatre every Monday, 
Wednesday and Friday afternoon.
SEWICKLEY HIGH—46. PLEBES—2.
Saturday evening the Plebe team journeyed to 
Sewickley and lost to Sewickley High at the Y. M.
C. A. The game was warmly contested, but the 
High iSchool lads, who have been playing together 
since the first of the season, had the advantage.

You have heard about the hollow sound the 
Sphinx makes wher the desert wind blows? If you 
wish to hear a reproduction of this phenomenon, 
listen to a speech by Bascom.
Prof. (in Physics)—“Marcus, take a zero!”
Marcus—“Farnheit, centigrade or absolute?”
Chemistry Instructor—“Where’s Agnew this 
morning?”
Bascom—“He is down in drawing room, I think.”
Borschneck—“Yes, he’s down there. I saw 
him there yesterday.”
In the electricity class one of the fellows 
thought that a wet cell was something like the 
damp dungeons he had read about in history.
Mr.------“Give me a sentence containing the
word “metaphysical.’ ”
O'C-------- ‘The other day I met a physical direc­
tor.”
We regret to announce that C. Frank Borsch­
neck has resigned his office as Chief Refuter of Ar­
guments advanced by Joseph Wilson, Jr. The rea­
sons for the resignation have not been officially 
stated, but it is rumored that Borschneck quit when 
the following question was opened by Wilson for 
discussion". “If smoking is allowed only in the lower 
corridor, how fast do the trains go past New 
Brighton?’
Naismith was heard to remark that it was 
about time for the Industrials to clean off the ice 
on thi> tennis courts.

PLEBES LOSE TO INDUSTRIALS.
On Friday evening the Plebes and Industrials 
came together in a hotly contested game of basket­
ball at the Amphitheatre. The game served as' a 
preliminary to the event of the evening. The Indus­
trials were fortunate in having three of last season’s 
foot-ball stars in their line-up in the persons of 
Brown, Robinson and Hittner, and this fact, no doubt 
decided the game in their favor. Line-up and score: 
Industrials—31. Plebes—19.

The writer had the opportunity of witnessing 
the class of 1912 assemble for their class meeting 
on Friday night and was much impressed with the 
spirit shown. The business-like manner of the pro­
ceedings speaks well for the future of this class, 
and which, by the way, has all the marks of a serious 
intelligent and permanent organization.
The combined musical clubs will give a concert 
in Homestead on February 18th.
The Reference Library of Theta Beta Psi has 
been placed on the mailing lists of all the Westing- 
house Publishing Departments. All publications of 
these companies will be received as they are issued 
and will make valuable additions to the library for 
the use of the members.
Culbertson and Grote are the representatives 
of 1910 on the year book editorial staff; some inter­
esting details of 1910 will now be brought to light, 
through their competent efforts. Look out for some 
truthful knocks.
The banquet committee is working energet­
ically, if quietly, and definite plans will be shortly 
announced.
A. L. Summers paid a short visit to his home 
recently. He came back with some new ideas as to 
“how they do things in Wheeling.”

Pie, as a midnight diet, is not conductive to 
sound engineering reasoning.
Taxis would like to see Hamnett of the Day 
Seniors and Bates of the Day Juniors on Sunday 
afternoon at Mandolin rehearsal. This is important 
and should any one see either of these students 
tell them of the fact.
The Musical Club’s annual concert will be held 
in Carnegie Musical Hall on Tuesday evening, March 
10th. The schools will be closed on this night and 
a large student attendance is looked for. Get your

Professor Walter F. Knox, Ph.D., joined the 
Tech Faculty in the fall of 1906. Born in India, 
remo\,ng to England with his parents at an early 
age, receiving his early education there, and later 
attending the City and Guild’s College at London, 
he continued his education at the University of 
Strassburgh and received his doctor’s degree from 
that institution for research work in physics, after­
ward working for various industrial corporations on 
both sides of the ocean in general along electrical 
engineering lines. His thorough mastery of the 
subject he teaches which has been thoroughly de­
monstrated since he became Assistant Professor of 
Mathematics, has won for him a place high among 
the leaders of our schools; while his happy method 
of explanation, coupled with his willingness to repeat 
until even the blind may see, has endeared him to 
the student body even so far that his Chautauqua 
salute or ever ready good! goody! fail to provoke 
a passing smile.
The committee assignments of Professor Knox 
have not brought him into intimate contact with 
the students, but when a committee is organized 
to show us wherein we may gain more by the 
gentle methods of diplomacy rather than by the 
ruder methods of we will, or we won’t, he will 
undoubtedly be chosen as its head.
Illinois has made extensive preparations for 
their Post-Exam. Jubilee this year. They have many 
interesting attractions booked to help cheer up the 
down-hearted under classmen.
IINDUSTRIALS
o
We note in the Plebe column of the last Tartan 
that three of their number, “for a while, were con­
tent to watch the Industrials horse-play.” Consid­
ering that the occasions are rare upon which we 
condescend to indulge in pastimes so plebian, and 
are seldom graced with so illustrious and gentle­
manly an audience we would fain be forgiven if we 
have offended those gentlemen.
The Industrials would gladly second any steps 
taken on Manager Steen’s proposition to organize 
an Inter-Tech Basket-Ball League.
WANTED—A young man susceptible to the 
charms of a corps of stenographers in the purchas­
ing department of a large educational institution in 
this vicinity.
NOTE—Position vacated by young man going 
away for a pleasure trip through the South.
If some of the other classes would follow the 
precedent established by the Industrials and prac­
tice school songs and yells at their class meetings, 
by the time the base-ball and foot-ball seasons open­
ed Tech would be able to outdistance our opponents' 
in rooting at least.
The Industrial Basket-Ball team in their initial 
game with Wilkinsburg High School were defeated 
by a score of 19—6. Line-up:
Industrials. Wilkinsburg
Johnson .........................F .........................................Bein
Brown ............................F .........................................Ross
Newlin ............................C ....................................Hunter
Robinson C......................G .............................McDaniels
Hittner .............................G.............................Bunker C
Substitutions—McTighe, Straub. The features 
of the game were Hittner’s “quarterback” work and 
the goal shooting of McDaniels.
A Remarkable Simile.

The social committee has done good work in 
collecting the donation asked from each member 
of the class, yet it seems there are still a few stray 
bits of coin which could be had simply, for the ask­
ing. In fact, several of the members of the class 
have appeared to be somewhat offended because 
they have not been asked to contribute. A condi­
tion like this should not be allowed to exist and we 
can assure these members in question that some 
member of the social committee will only too gladly 
do the asking. The fault, however, does not wholly 
lie with the committee in this matter. - The members 
of the class should remember that thè committee is 
a very busy bunch of fellows these days, and that, 
if they have overlooked a few persons it has been 
done inadvertently, and not as the result of a desire 
to run the class affairs on the “gang" plan. It is 
encouraging to note that the displeased members 
are so, not because they have been asked, but be­
cause they have not been asked.
Mr. Sample, secretary, was absent from school 
the fore part of last week, hence the non-appearance 
of the class meeting notice on the bulletin board. 
Though the attendance was not as good as at pre­
vious meetings there was enough present to form 
a quorum—and a few more—and the business of 
the evening was soon rushed through with.
Farrell—“Is the stress on this beam 10,000 or 
15,000 pounds per square inch?”
Prof. H.—“I didn’t ask for distress. I asked 
for ‘de load.’ ”
Stuart C-l (commenting on an experience of 
his)—“¡Some women are ox-eyed.”
“Yes, and some are peroxide,” replied Finch, 
with contempt.
Why does Prof. Lowe have a big chunk of ice 
brought into the lecture room every Friday evening? 
He must think the fellows in C-l are warm members 
and need cooling off.
Advice to Contributors.
“Some little knocking has been noticed,” etc.,
etc.
And now certain contributors have to improve 
their writing, taking a correspondence course, if 
necessary.
Deerst, D-l, furnished Sections C and D quite
a little amusement last Friday evening. A debate
on the subject, “Divorce,” was the occasion, which
gave this young orator his opportunity. Prof. Doyle 
failed to find his remarks very amusing, however. 
In fact, Prof. D. must have been shocked for he 
instructed Mr. Deerst to “handle delicate subjects 
in a delicate manner” hereafter.
So we may write this equation in this “---------.”
“Not yet, but soon,” interjected Richards, as the 
lights went out. And Prof. Lowe could have smoked 
another pipeful before the light returned, but— 
lie didn’t.
Personals.
McCowen has added J. W. Crosby (A-l) to his 
athletic committee.
Ryman (C-l) has replaced Laughlin, who lately 
resigned from the social committee.
Kearns (C-l) has recently taken and passed a 
civil service examination for draftsman for the city. 
He has received his appointment and will enter 
upon his duties in a few days.
Keagy and Skeehan are candidates for the track 
team, and successful candidates, too.

A. F. Stamm, Editor.
The members of 1911 who are wondering at the 
irregularity of class meetings have a justifiable “kick 
coming” as the institution of the class provides for 
a meeting every month. Now, with the rush of 
school work and the preparations for the banquet, 
the active members of the class have their hands 
full; and for this reason the officers deemed it best 
to pass the February meeting until the evening of 
the 20th at the banquet. On discussion it developed 
that the men are not to be blamed for not caring 
to attend class meetings as but little can be done 
from 10.30 to 11 o’clock at which time the lights 
are turned off.
“Those of ’11 who are interested in the arrange­
ment of social stunts have had a gratifying attend­
ance at all functions yet given by the class and so 
long as the class supports such affairs what reason 
is there in harassing the men to attend a dull mono­
tonous half-hour every month when the committees 
will do the work when called upon?”
The above is the opinion of many ’11 men and 
the writer is compelled to admit the justice of the 
contention. It is a compliment to the activity of 
the committee, but it sounds as though there were 
but a few who had time to devote to class affairs.

It is a dear price to pay if the officers and commit­
tee-men have to sacrifice their success in class for 
the honor of their respective offices.
President Stamm, who took it upon himself to 
see that Mr. A. K. Southard was suitably rewarded, 
wishes to thank the gentlemen of -'11 for the grand 
support they accorded him when the appeal for funds 
for the floral tributes to our departed comrade.
A full report of the funds received and spent will 
be filed 'with the treasurer and read at the next 
meeting.
A financial report by the chairman of the social 
committee on the smoker will be published next 
week, together with a report'of all the funds which 
have passed through the treasurer’s hands this term.
Mr. Morgan, of B-2, is to be one of the principal 
speakers at the banquet, February 20th. Mr. Mor­
gan and Mr. Workman, the toastmaster, are both 
good speakers and with the assistance of ex-Pres. 
Harley, of ’11, Jerome Lonergan, ex-’11; Mr. Doyle, 
the advisor, and Mr. Connelly, the intellectual past 
will be the equal if not the peer of any future ban­
quet.
1911 wishes 1912 success writh her smoker and 
will send a delegation armed with turbits and olive 
branches.

BACHELORS LOSE.
In a game replete with excitement and interest 
the basket-ball team representing the married men 
of the Tech Faculty,' defeated one composed of 
bachelors, by a score of 9 to 2. As the result plainly 
shows, the opponents were about evenly matched 
and so closely did the contestants guard one another 
that few opportunities to shoot presented themselves, 
and those tallies made were shot from difficult an­
gles and positions. Mr. Work threw a basket that 
called forth much applause from the fair rooters, 
and well merited it was, for while closely guarded, 
he succeeded by using excellent judgment in his 
“English on the ball” and scoring from a position at 
the extreme left of the basket. Messrs. Aude and 
Dehough did good work for the bachelors, and Mr. 
Dosey proved a tower of strength for the married 
contingent. The line-up:

12THE TARTAN
EFFICIENT FOREMANSHIP.
A short time ago, while walking through a ma­
chine shop of a large machine-tool building firm, the 
superintendent called our attention to a middle-aged 
man standing in front of a bench near a group of 
automatic gear cutters and engaged in testing a 
gear which had apparently just been cut. Six years 
ago that man was a common laborer and was at 
work cleaning old bricks just before entering his 
present employer’s service. The superintendent 
with whom we were talking needed help, noticed 
this man at his laboring work, hired him, found him 
capable, took an interest in showing and teaching 
him, and to-day he has charge of all of the automatic 
gear cutters, cutting thousands of gears each year, 
in the shop which he entered as a common laborer.
On the following day we visited another machine 
shop and the owner pointed out an active man at 
work on a group of milling.machines. Four years 
ago that man was carrying castings around the shop, 
snagging, sweeping the floor, and doing all kinds of 
laboring work. A milling machine hand was need­
ed and the foreman decided to give him a trial, at 
the same time interesting himself in the man’s pro­
gress and instructing him thoroughly in the details 
of the use of the machines. To-day that man is a 
working second hand on a milling-machine job hav­
ing a large variety of machines.
The advancement of these two men from the 
rank of a common laborer to that of a skilled me­
chanic doing executive work shows plainly the effi­
cient foremanship under which they have worked. 
Such foremanship is to be commended, and presents 
a striking comparison with the attitude of the fore­
man who requires the most skillful workmen through­
out his department in order, if possible, to cover up 
his own deficiences. A manufacturing machine-shop 
department filled with high-priced help is apt to run 
itself, rather than to be run by the foreman in 
charge; but the man who can produce the quantity 
of work required, at a reasonable cost and with effi­
cient labor, though not necessarily highly paid, is 
the one who is getting real results. The unskilled 
man works for low wages for two reasons: one be­
cause of his inability to produce through lack of 
knowledge and training; the other because he must 
pay, indirectly of course, for the necessary expert 
supervision in order that he may produce to the 
advantage of his employer. This expert supervision 
comes through the medium of his foreman, and it is 
his right that he should be properly instructed in 
order that he may gain in efficiency.
Men who are lifted from the position of the 
common laborer to that of the skilled operator of­
ten become the best men in manufacturing depart­
ments and add an element of strength to the fac­
tory’s organization because of the relationship which 
exists between them, as efficient workmen, and the 
foreman who has been instrumental in increasing 
their efficiency. A successful foreman should pro-

14THE TARTAN
ELECTRICITY IN GERMAN MINES.
Reduction of mining costs by electric operation 
has been effected in the Gewerkschaft Carlsfund 
mines in Germany, where a storage battery system 
has been installed in connection with the generator 
outfit. The plant, as explained by the Engineering 
Magazine, was equipped at first with one 100-kw. 
polyphase generator, and two smaller ones, rated 
at 50 and 35 kw. Although the average load was 
only about 30 kw., there was such an extreme varia­
tion in the load from one minute to the next that it 
was found necessary to run the large machine al­
most continuously. A storage battery of about 
650 amp.-hr. capacity was installed, and con-' 
nected to the terminals of a direct-current machine, 
from which it was charged during light loads. This 
machine was driven by the 30-kw. polyphase gener­
ator, running as a motor. On the same shaft was 
mounted a single phase rotary converter, power for 
which was supplied by a series transformer in one 
of the three-phase mains.
Direct. current from this rotary is passed
through a second winding on the field of the direct 
current generator, the connections being such that 
the latter opposes the normal shunt excitation. Dur­
ing periods of light load, the voltage of the direct- 
current machine is high, and it therefore charges 
the batteries. As the load increases, however, the 
voltage of the generator decreases, until it finally 
begins to operate as a motor, driving its motor as 
a generator, and thus supplying power to the sys­
tem. By this means the load curve is smoothed 
out very markedly, and it has been found possible 
to carry it by means of the 50-kw. generator, except 
during periods of the heaviest load.

The General Electric Company at Schenectady 
has an apprenticeship system for the training of 
draftsmen. For admission, the apprentice is re­
quired to pass a stiff examination in arithmetic, 
which most of the candidates fail to pass. Those 
admitted first spend about three months in the blue­
printing department, then six months in the tracing 
department, this latter period being considered suf­
ficient for turning out an expert tracer. After that 
the student is kept for a year in the factory, being 
transferred as a rule from department to depart­
ment every three months. After that the final two 
years are spent in the drafting room. During the 
whole time the student is required to study algebra, 
geometry, trigonometry, projections, strength of 
materials, etc., and to draw add trace fifty instruc­
tion sheets from sketches furnished to him. The 
pay of the apprentice during 4he four years’ train­
ing ranges from $3.40 per wreek during the first six 
months to $7.50 a week during the last year.

Liquid fuel for locomotives is becoming more 
and more common in the southern portion of the 
United States as well as in Mexico. It is reported 
by the Torreon Star that the Mexican Central Rail­
way is using 4,000 barrels of fuel oil daily, and is 
steadily increasing the number of oil-burning en­
gines in its service. All new engines purchased are 
equipped for the burning of oil, and old engines are 
constantly being remodeled.

The construction followed in tall office buildings 
of New York and other cities has an important 
effect on the insurance rates. The “Caledonian,” a 
new building recently erected in Pine street, New 
York, carries an insurance rate of only 50 cents per 
$1,000. The building has a cast iron frame protected 
by porous terra-cotta and brick, and is twelve stories 
high. In contrast to this is a ten-story building in 
Broad street, not far from the New York Stock Ex­
change, which pays twice as much, or $1.00 per 
$1,000. The addition in rate is because the metal 
frame is not protected by either terra-cotta or brick.

One of the largest blasts ever fired in France 
was discharged last fall at the quartzite quarries at 
Cherbourg, and is said to have displaced 120,000 
tons of stone. A tunnel measuring six feet wide 
and six feet high, was driven into the face of the 
cliff for a distance of 70 feet, and at its end two 
branch tunnels, each 20 feet long, were driven to 
the right and left, respectively. These branches 
ended in chambers 40 feet apart and 70 feet from 
the face of the cliff, and measuring each 10x6x6 feet. 
The chambers were charged with 8V2 tons of blast­
ing powder and 280 pounds of dynamite, and the 
blast was fired electrically. The quartzite obtained 
from this quarry finds much favor in England as a 
road material.

The vibration of the after-part of high-speed 
ocean liners driven by reciprocating engines is a 
serious trouble that has not been successfully over­
come by any system of engine balancing. One of 
the swiftest of the ocean greyhounds, the Deutsch­
land, has been most troublesome in this respect, al­
though the engines are balanced by the Schlick sys­
tem. The defect was recently largely overcome in 
an interesting manner. The pitch of the blades of 
the port propeller was reduced slightly, the effect 
being that the port engine runs eight revolutions 
faster than the starboard propeller in order to give 
the same effective thrust and speed of propulsion. 
This throwing of the engines out of step minimized 
the vibration of both the engines and the propellers. 
It long has been known by marine engineers that 
throwing the engines of twin-screw ships out of step 
tends to reduce vibration, but the trouble of doing 
this with propellers of the same pitch is the difficulty 
of steering, there being a tendency of the vessel to 
run in a circle, owing to the difference in thrust of 
the two propellers.
