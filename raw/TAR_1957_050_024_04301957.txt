Two Great Jazz Bands To Play 
At This Year’s Spring Carnival
This year’s Carnival will feature two great jazz bands—The Kai 
Winding Septet at the jazz concert in the gym on Friday night and 
Woody Herman and The Third Herd.
Upon receiving his discharge from the Coast Guard in 1945, Kai 
Winding went with the Benny’
Goodman organization. In 1946 
and 1947, Kai’s name took a new 
prominence through his featured 
.work on Stan Kenton’s “Artistry 
in Rhythm” series “The Trom­
bone Soun.i,” created by Kai, 
stayed on with the Kenton Band 
after he moved 'on to the Charlie 
Ventura All-Star Sextet, and 
finally to' his own group.
Birdland Star 
From late 1949 thru early 
1954, with sidemen sùch as Gerry 
Mulligan, Max Roach and George 
Wallington, Kai opened “Bop 
City” and was a regular at "Bird­
land.”
In mid 1956, Kai and J. J. parted, 
and Kai formulated a new group 
that would represent the “Trom­
bóne Sound" at its peak. With the 
launching of the Kai Winding 
Septet, four trombones and three 
rhythm, jazz history is being made.

court in its Wednesday meeting.
Charges concerning ’school and 
public offneses involving, three 
fraternities, were acted uponz- The 
four particular offenses are as fol­

1. An illegal dale party at the 
Pi Kappa Alpha house;
2. The cementing of a valuable

a streetcar. >
.All occurred during the night of 
Monday, April 22 and early morn­

ternities are Pi Kappa Alpha, 
whose only apparent offense is the

Theta Xi.
The polic'e were of course' con­

events, but they were unable to 
make any positive accusations. No 
was arrested. However, C1£P

At the present time, all seven 
sororities have entered the com­
petition. The* honoraries, Citcom 
Clan,, and dorm council, who

Rita Menke Honorary Colonel 
At Pershing Rifles Drill Meet
At a ¡banquet and military ball which climaxed the Regimental 
Drill Meet last Saturday, Rita Menke, a junior home economics major» 
was awarded the title of honorary colonel of the 5th Regiment of 
Pershing Rifles. ?
Each of the'twenty-four schools 
which entered the contest sent in 
pictures of.their company queens.
Miss Menke was selected for this 
honor on the basis of her picture 
which was entered by the Tech 
Pershing Rifles team. Next Sep­
tember her picture will be sub­
mitted to the national rifle team 
contest.
At the meet, whose host 
Duquesne University and which 
included fifteen schools from 
Pennsylvania, Virginia, and Mary­
land, Tech took first place in the 
rifle match with W & J and Du­
quesne runners-up. Penn State 
placed first in trick drill and 
Pennsylvania Military College 
captured first in standard drill.
Members of the rifle team are 
Don Cronauer, Vic Polansky, Wal­
ter Michael, Jack Brown, and Wil­
liam. Nuzo. Mr. Polansky recently 
won the title of National Inter­
collegiate Champion at a match 
in Cincinnati.
Other Competitions
Jn preparation for this meet 
Tech entered competitions two 
weeks ago against other Pitts­
burgh schools.
Resplendent in white gloves, 
belts, spats, and white helmets 
emblazoned with the Pershing 
Rifles crest in addition to their 
regular-issue basic ROTC cadet 
uniforms, the Carnegie Tech P/R 
drill team captured first place, 
and four out of- ten trophies in 
competition against other Pitts­
burgh schools at Duquesne on Sat­
urday, April 13.
Competing in basic and trick 
drill, as well as rifle shooting, 
against units from Duquesne, Pitt, 
W.&J.. and Pitt Johnstown Cen­
ter, the team accumulated 2119.5 
points, 159.4 more than runner- 
up Duquesne. Beside the cham­
pionship, the company was award­
ed a trophy for the best-drilled 
company in the meet.
Tech's entire drill unit, consist­
ing of sixteen men, under the com­
mand of Company Commander 
Terry Sharp, marched to a first' 
place award in basic standard 
drill—(This competition consists 
of those movements exercised in 
the regular Thursday ROTC drill 
period.) First Sergeant Ivan Suth­
erland conducted a 15-man pla­
toon to' a second place trophy in 
basic trick drill and an 8-man 
squad to another second in squad 
drill.
Individual awards were pre­
sented to cadets Calvin Marlett 
and James Bane for third and 
fourth places respectively in the 
best individual performance com­
petition.

of these names may be familiar to 
you—others may not. They are 
but a few of the thousands who 
are past members of a unique 
club—the CIT Scotch ' 'n Soda 
Club.
To the unitiated and unknowing, 
Scotch ’n Soda can stand for but 
one thing albeit with many con­
notations depending upon the in­
dividual. But at Tech these three 
simple words stand for the title of 
an all-student organization which 
each year presents a completely 
original musical variety show. The 
students, according to preference 
and ability, compose the scores 
and lyrics, design sets and cos­
tumes, execute costumes, sets, and 
lights, carry out publicity, and act, 
sing and dance.

VIDEOT’S DELIGHT
. The academic-world has made its first tentative steps 
into television. A few lectures, a few seminars« but may 
I respectfully suggest that the academic world has not 
yet learned the full potential of television?
Why doq’t the colleges-use television’s vast capacity 
to dramatize, to amuse, to unshackle the imagination? Like, for example, this:
MAA^aAwsJS Howdy, folks. Well, it’s time again for 
that lovable, laughable pair, Emmett Twonkey Magruder, -

ing, roistering fun show, American History 101____And
here they are, the team that took the "hiss” out of 
history"—Emmett Twonkey Magruder and Felicia May Crimscott!
Dr. Magruder: Howdy, .folks. A funny thing hap­
pened to me on the way to my doctorate. A mendicant 
approached me and said, "Excuse me, sir, will you give 
i sandwich?” I replied, “Perhaps I will, 
i see the sandwich.”
MISS Crimscott: Oh, how droll, Dr. Magruder' How 
piquant! How je ne saijj quoi! ... But enough of badi­
nage. Let us get on with our rollicking, roistering fun show, American History 101.

[Continued from page 2] 
S rn S production during early May.
The history of Scotch 'n Soda 
goes all the way back to 1907 when 
a club called "the White Friars 
organized for the purpose of pre­
senting a .musical titled “All In 
A Dormitory." This club existed 
until 1913 when World War Z 
brought a suspension of its activ­
ities. Tcch remained without a 
musical club until 1932 when a 
group of students organized the 
Bacchanalians." Changing its. 
name in 1930, it presented its first 
production, “No ¡Strings.”
War Intervenes 
During World War It, the .-club 
was! again forie^dto remain inac­
tive but returned again in 1947 
to present what probably has been 
its best production, “Rock and 
Riot.” The shows originally were 
presented in Pittsburgh’s Carnegie 
Music Hall but ip past years have 
been staged in a specially con­
structed theater in Tech!s gym.
While collegiate “Variety 
Shows” are not unknown, Tech’s 
production can rightfully claim a 
place of its own at the top—for a 
number of reasons. Other educa­
tional institutions have their tra­
ditional musical organizations such 
Pitt’s Cap and Gown, the Har­
vard Hasty Pudding Club and the 
Princeion Triangle Club, but all 
at least partly sponsored by 
the alumni and frequently alumni- 
ritten or directed.
Scotch ’n Soda, a young organ­
ization still making tradition 
rather than following It—last year 
it began producing its shows, as 
show people say, “theater-in-the- 
round” S otch 'n Soda is unique 
being written, produced and 
played entirely by undergrad­
uates. It is also different in incl.ud- 1 
in the cast of its productions j 
numtfers of lovely young ladies— 
not merely facsimiles. :
Although hosts of Scotch ’n I 
Soda “grads" are now prominent I 
the various entertainment fields | 
such as radio, television, movie, 
broadway and theater, a proper 
perspective should be kept by the 
outsider looking in. The club is 
not dedicated to making stars from 
students—and as any active per­
former knows this is hardly pos­
sible—its purposes are nebulous 
yet in many ways objective. It 
gives any student at Carnegie 
Tech a chance, if he has some 
ability, to participate in a student activity.
Spring Carnival, 
An Unforgettable 
Weekend Of Fun
By Ron Abrams
...Several times during this past 
year, I've been approached by 
freshmen with the question, “Ron, 
what is Spring Carnival?" Last 
Carnival, WRCT produced a 
teen minute tape-recorded radio 
program for which KDKA graci­
ously allowed airtime. Since I wa; 
in charge of the planning and ex­
ecution of this program, I had at 
opportunity to see Spring Carni­
val from all angles — from the 
painstaking preparation to the 
final bell at- Morewood at three 
o’clock Sunday morning. What 
Spring Carnival?
Everybody Works on S’nS!
When Scotch ’n Soda begi 
work in Septembei, interest is first 
aroused on campus.
The cast isn’t the only part of 
the group that works hard, and 
I saw this first-hand, loo- The 
crews, the publicity departments, 
and the administrative staff com­
bine forces to produce one of the 
most sparkling arrays of talent 
you will see in a non-professional 
group.
Spring Carnival is only begin­
ning with the last performance of 
Scotch ’n’ Soda on Thursday. On 
Friday, it is officially opened by 
the Spring Carnival Queen at 
“Call Day” when the honor; 
call their new members and when 
the trophies for athletics and 
scholarship are awarded. Then 
comes the most inspiring moment 
of the weekend! At noon on Fri­
day, the Cut is officially opened. 
The rides and booths present a 
colorful spectacle that surprises 
even those who have witnessed 
carnivals, of other years.
Glittering Cut
The fraternities compete to see 
who- can build the most unusual 
booth to, fit the theme, and the 
competition is strong! The Cut— 
which you.have been walking over 
in all kinds of weather,'at all hours 
for almost a year—is transformed 
into a glittering midway. In/ the 
past we’ve had a ferris wheel,' a 
carousel, and many other rides 
guaranteed to spin you, bounce 
you, swing you, and upend you! 
Cotton candy, hot dogs, and soda 
pop can be had in plentiful 
amounts.- >
On Saturday morning, the final I 
heats of the buggy—or pushmo- I 
bile—races are run. The fratern- | 
have spent much time, 
money, and research to make their 
buggies as frictionless as possible. 
The vehicles are judged on the 
basis of design as well as speed.

At the formal, about eleven

winners of the booth competition 
and the results of the other events 
to a tense, breathless crowd:
It is impossible to describe in a 
small space the great fund of tal­

ciously, at the pestilence of student apathy— 
for what else so readily lends itself to the 
editorial blade?
Well, tradition though it may be, a new 
editorial era is now at hand, and student 
apathy is no more. The Tech student has 
spirit; he wants to do things though he 
doesn’t know it—but the environment is not 
conducive to this. Now and then pent-up 
energy is released in a foray on the More- 
wood pond, the Pittsburgh Railways, or new 
buildings (see page 1). These Easter esca­
pades, unfortunate as they were, indicate 
spirit on the part of the participants.
The author is not praising- them or their 
deeds, rather they are to be condemned. In­
deed' the matter is of utmost seriousness. Much 
valuable property was destroyed. The tree 
pictured on this page, which may now be seen 
on the new fraternity dormitory lot and whose 
future is in doubt, cost well over $100; windows 
arc of monetary value; and streetcars (anti hos­
pital bills of transients) are surely not Inex­
pensive. It is certainly hoped that the CFP 
court will find.and properly deal with those re­
sponsible.
To get back to school spirit, one may re­
call the incidents of this past fall with W. 
and J. In thqse cases drinking was not a 
factor—it ' was solely school spirit. The 
damage done is not to be condoned any more 
than that done at Easter, but certainly the 
majority of_dorm and fraternity men were 
itching to have a good night battle with the 
Prexies. To a large degree, that spirit is 
school spirit.
It is, of course, unfortunate that destruc­
tion must accompany these flowerings of 
CITism, and the courts of CFP and the stu­
dent government are designed to contend 
with it. Preventive measures are also desir­
able. With regard to the Easter escapades it 
-•has been suggested to CFP that a responsible 
person, selected by the fraternity, be re­
quired to be present in each fraternity house 
which is going to be open during a recess.
Here is an idea that will work, if it is work­
able; i.e.. if any one person In each house will 
be willing to spend his vacation days and eve­
nings on campus “minding the boys.” Such a 
responsibility is extremely large when inci­
dents comparable to the recent ones occur.
Thus far only the question of overt spirit 
has been considered. This doesn’t really bear 
much on student government and activities. 
The author finds it much harder to conjure 
up examples of enthusiastic, mass student 
participation—the Tartan office at this mo­
ment is inhabited by only six loyal workers; 
less than one hundred fifty persons bothered 
to vote in the Constitution ratification a year 
ago (a truly classic example of the apathe- 
ists.) No, on mass participation, your author 
must. concede.
However, student apathy is not the cause!! 
The Homecoming queen elections were char­
acterized by a scarcity of votes last fall. The
reason was in part—-a large part—that there 
was poor .publicity of the event. Oil the mor­
ning -of the elections no posters were to be 
seen on the Cut or in front of- Skibo. Oft 
heard is the complaint about the assemblies 
on Tuesday at 11:30. Few attend unless an 
unusually vital and interesting speaker or 
topic is scheduled, primarily because 11:30 
is lunch hour for a great.majority. (The Cym- 
beline lecture is an example of a success.) 
True, the 12:30 hour is served for lunch, but 
the stomach is a powerful motivator.
The trouble lies in the planners, the leaders. 
Perhaps the school was recognizing this when 
the Leadership Conferences were held last year. 
When students are properly approached, they 
are generally reasonable and will respond. 
Consider Campus Chest three years ago—mis­
management netted little more than. $1000. 
This year Tech topped $3000, a success.
To be reasonable and avoid the thorough 
contempt of his fellows, the writer must ad­
mit that leadership is not the only cause. 
Other factors in the Carnegie environment 
.are present too. Tech is a city school with 
many commuters. Although some commu­
ters are quite active, many others find it dif­
ficult to be so. Also, the off-campus attrac­
tions of city living are forces with which to 
be reckoned. Inactivity isn’t all “I don’t 
care.”
Perhaps the reader isn’t convinced that 
student apathy is a myth. That is his right­
ful opinion. Possibly at a later date this 
question can be rearraigned and looked at 
again.

Morewood Pond Sprouts Tree
We thought that we should never see a pond embellished with a tree.
Morbid Food
Editor,' the Tartan:
I fail to see how the human 
female can conceivably endure 
some of the atrocities foisted up­
on the Morewood inhabitants by 
staff members who assume the 
divine right of kings in dealing 
with the innocent and well-mean­
ing girls. I refer specifically to the 
seldom seen but ever present staff 
of people who plan and manage 
the Morewood meals.
Some of the most repugnant' 
food ever served has been served 
in Morewood, and often for Sun­
day dinners. Pan fried loin steak 
au gristle au fat is usually unfit 
for human consumption, and roast 
beef au jus is little better.
But the most outrageous facet 
of the whole infested system is the 
fact that all girls must pay for all 
meals whether they eat them or 
not. And slill more ridiculous is 
the rule that no fraction of an un­
claimed meal may be eaten at an­
other time. In other words, if a 
girl is lucky enough to eat out 
twice a weekend and misses six or 
seven Morewood meals, she can­
not, in the days following, have so 
much as even an orange or a dish 
of ice cream or a glass of milk of 
the meals she missed, but paid for.
Colored Tickcts
Or if she does not feel like con­
suming her quota of a given sub­
stance on a given day, she cannot 
have more than her quota on the 
following day if she would then 
like to have what she didn't lake 
before. The diabolical dietician, to 
thoroughly accomplish this end, 
even devised a colored ice crcam 
ticket system, whereby ticket 
colors are alternated daily.
Someone who was sufficiently 
nauseated .by yesterday’s meal so 
as to be unable to consume her 
ice cream cannot cash in her tick­
et today and get both ice crcam 
and apple to eat later. If she 
saves her ticket until the color 
comes up again, she might get 
away with it if the dietician isn’t 
around, but woe lo the girl who is 
caught trying to do such a dread­
ful thing!
Expensive Lemon
Lemon slices cost three cents 
each and butter patties arc four 
ccnts. I personally don’t care how 
much Pitt, Duquesne, and Bally­
hoo Norma) pay for extra lemon 
slices and butter patties; what 
Morewood food service charges is 
too much. With lemons at $.69 a 
dozen, this figures out to be some­
thing like 500% profit, and for 
butter, it is around 200%.
If I were living in Morewood, I 
would not stand for these atroci­
ties, and Womens’ Dorm Council 
shouldn’t allow it either, although 
I understand they are handicap­
ped by an abysmal lack of co­
operation from the Food Service. 
It may be anticipated in the bud­
get that all of the girls will not 
eat all of the meals to which they 
are entitled, hence the reason why 
they are not permitted to get all 
of the food they pay for, but it 
seems unreasonable that small de­
ficiencies of one day cannot be 
made up the next, especially since 
there is food left over after near­
ly every meal.
It would be extremely interest­
ing to see an explanation from 
the Morewood Food Service of 
these questionable policies appear 
in the Tartan, such as the 6ne 
from the library several weeks 
ago.
A. Faithful Reader
P.S. Incidentally what ever 
happened about the library fine 
business? Hundreds of people 
agree with the Tartan opinion, but 
what is ever going to be done 
about it? If the Tartan feels its 
journalistic responsibilities do not 
permit it to carry, the campaign 
further, why doesn’t Student Con­
gress or the UAC or the honoraries 
or somebody do something more?
(Editor’s note: Good old A. 
Faithful is a regular contributor, 
as the true name o{ an author 
will be withheld upon request. 
However, no ai!0ii?/?H0us letters 
unll be printed.)
Hardships
Editors, the Tartan:
I am one of a number of stu­
dents who are infinitely superior 
to the rest of Carnegie’s student 
body. You see, I made the honor 
list last term. Furthermore, I’m 
terribly insecure and need lo be 
reassured periodically of my vast 
talents. Besides that, I love lo 
criticize others — especially ihe 
registrar’s office for maliciously 
neglecting to post last semester’s 
list of brilliant students. I raised 
my factor 0.03 from last year and 
have had to resort lo unpleasant 
means lo inform my "friends" of 
this. Please inform the apathetic 
administration of this serious over­
sight.
Conceitedly yours, 
Ethclbert Ego,
A True Student

Tech Splits In Track
Carnegie Tech’s thinclads evened up their. 1957 . season'by win­
ning a triangular meet from Case and Fenn in Cleveland last Satur­
day aft^r dropping a meet to a much improved Washington and Jef­
ferson ..squad just before Easter. This gives Tech-a 2r2 record with 
3 meets remaining. ------------------ -------------¦——------
Against W & J the Plaid took 
only six of ‘ fifteen firsts and were 
eventually outscored 83-47. Tech’s 
big'ievent was the two mile. Dick 
Hamilton, Eric Ottervik, and Len 
Elikan placed 1-2-3 to shut out the 
PrèXys. In his third appearance of 
the year Larry Bryant turned in 
his third consecutive winning half- 
mile; while in the quarter mile 
Eric Suggs also took his third win 
©f tjie year.
The field events lured a bit bet­
ter than previously as Joe Frick 
outdistanced his opponents with a 
162' 2" javelin throw and Bill Fet­
ter heaved the discus 109' 9l6".
The' Tartans toon the triangular 
meet from Case ànd Fenn by a de­
cisive 81V2 to Case’s 49 % and 
Fenji's 24-5/6. Tech was on its 
way toi a first place in every win? 
ning .event until being disqualified 
in the' 880 relay, Which is substitu­
ted'for the javelin in Ohio. How-' 
ever, the field events' were more 
©f the same old story as the Tar­
tans won only the brdad jump, 
placing far back in the shot and 
discus.
Garcia Injured
Jim Thompson passed Rique 
Garcia to win the 100 yard dash. 
Garcia pulled a muscle in his left 
leg during the ace. It is not yet 
known how serious the injury will 
be. Freshman, Milt Miles ran 
away with the low and high 
hurdle as Bill Bryant and Dick 
Swainey had no trouble in the.mile 
and 220, respectively. Larry Bryr- 
ant in the half mile and Eric Suggs 
in the quarjter both remained un­
defeated.
Most impressive was the deter­
mined comeback of Eric Ottervik, 
winner of the two mile. In prev­
ious meets he had finished second 
twice and third once. Before the 
season, Ottervik was not expected 
to. compete in away meets due to 
a knee injury.

Tennis Team 
TFins, Loses
Carnegie Tech led off its 1957 
tennis season last Wednesday with 
an easy home victory over Grove 
City. The visitors were simply 
too weak, and woii but three 
matches out of nine. Coach Moses, 
coaching his last season before re­
tirement, used four promising 
newcomers in his lineup as well as 
several returning lettermen.
The outstanding addition to the 
squad Is Gene Krygowski, a fresh­
man on leave from the Marine 
corps, who moved right into the 
number one singles spot, and 
should win a lot more matches for 
Tech. Two other freshmen, Mario
Volpe and A1 Winters, who were 
intramural champ and runner, up, 
won in the fifth ana sixth singles 
matches. In the other singles 
matches, Larry Dussair and Tom 
Bieg, playing second and fourth, 
respectively, won while Dick Na- 
worski lost- a close one .in the 
third singles.
The Tartans were less lucky in 
the doubles; Kent Williams, a jun­
ior transfer, and Karl Yu lost to 
Grove City’s two top men; Fran 
Wickham and Winters lost the 
second doubles; and Bieg and 
Krygowski won the third doubles.

SR Wins In Soccer
Beta Sigma Rho became IM 
Soccer champion, defeating Sigma 
NU 1-0 in a thrilling final playoff 
game.
The contest was a scoreless tie 
going into the third period when 
Werner Strauss, who had played a 
brilliant game, scored the only 
goal* to give the Beta Sig’s thè 
championship.
The game was not only a defen­
sive contest as the score might in­
dicate. Sigma Nu displayed a fast 
dribbing offense and made sev- 
eral'attempts at the -Beta Sig goal, 
but couldn’t put the ball through.
Beta Sig also came up with a 
quick breakaway attack featured 
by a quick passing game.
Sigma Nu gained the finals by 
conquering a fighting PiKA team 
3-0. The initial contest, between 
these teams ended in a one all tie, 
but Sigma Nu had too much for 
the PiKA’s and took the contest.
Beta Sig reached the finals by 
defeating Kappa Sigma 2-1 in a 
double overtime contest. Koko 
Lay, the Beta Sig all-league for­
ward, scoring the winning goal af­
ter Strauss. had knotted the con­
test at one'all going into overtime.
Although inclement weather did 
interrupt the season's schedule, 
most teams played good ball , and

the outlook for an exciting season 
next year looks very good at this 
point.
Softball Begins 
Obelisks Tough
IM softball season got under­
way on Monday as thirty-three 
teams are competing for the title 
this year.
This is the largest turnout of 
teams ever posted for softball. 
Last year 90 teams entered and the 
preceding year had 25.
The Obelisks, defending cham­
pions, are expected to field a 
strong team again this year, while 
ATO, last year’s other finalits, 
Theta XI, the Englishmen, and the 
Trojans are expected to make for
l exciting race.
A season’s schedule and a- set of 
rules are to be obtained at the IM 
office by all ter.ms; it is necessary 
that all teams become acquainted 
with the IM rules and that they 
present for games at the 
posted times. Teams failing to 
show up lor games wil lose by 
forfeit. Due to the late completion 
of . the soccer season, all games 
must be played off as quickly as 
possible so the tournament can be 
held before finals.

Mr. Bintzer To Deliver Talk 
At Evening Engineers Banquet
“Mission, Muscle, and Money,” is the topic chosen by Mr. Bintz­
er mam speaker at. this year’s Engineering Banquet. As is probably 
.. known to all, Mr. Bintzer came to Carnegie in January to accept the 
' post of vice president in - charge of coordinating the long range 
' development programs.
: Before coming to this newly 
created post .Mr. Bintzer 
- director of the Second. Cenjury 
Fund at "Washington University 
{St.- Louis, Missouri. ’
.- • Under Mr. Bintzer’s capable di­
rection, the Second Century Fund 
at Washington University produc­
ed $17,000,000 in less than three 
years for much needed campus 
• improvements and general finan­
cial support.
•"A native of Perkasie, Bucks 
County, Pennsylvania,. Mr. Bintz- 
-er has achieved a national repu­
diation tor his capable and effect- 
¦ ive direction of planning and de- 
: / velopment programs in engineer- 
••-•irig education and in colleges and 
v universitiesPromotes Understanding
At Washington University, the 
Second Century Fund not only 
achieved success in raising the 
: money needed for campus devel­
opment purposes, but it also 
brought about mutual understand­
ing on the part of the university 
and the city of their mutual de­
pendence. The. city realized its 
need for the university as a source 
of well trained and educated citi­
zens, and the university-fouod that, 
the cultural, educational and tech­
nical opportunities in addition to 
enthusiastic support were of im- 
‘ mense importance.- 
' Prior to directing the Washing­
ton University Fund, Mr. Bintz­
er was assistant to the president 
and executive director of the de­
velopment program at Drexel In­
stitute of Technology in Philadel­
phia While there he directed a 
corporate development program 
that resulted in the. construction 
of a $2,000,000 basic science lab­
oratory.Active Member-of Many 
Organizations
In the field of engineering edu­
cation, Mr. Bintzer has been sec­
retary, vic^i chairman, and chair­
man of the cooperative education 
" division of the American Society 
lor Engineering Education and has 
served as national chairman of 
this division’s committee on rela­
tions with the Federal Govern­
ment. He has also served as a 
member of the society’s steering 
committee on the relations with 
industry and is currently a mem­
ber of the National Evaluation 
Committee.
Mr*.. Bintzer graduated from 
Drexel in 1936 with a bachelor of 
science degree in business admin­
istration and received a master of 
science degree in business admin­
istration from Drexel in 1952.
Following his discharge from 
the service, Mr. Bintzer was ap­
pointed assistant director of the 
department of industrial coordin­
ation at Drexel. Prior to his ap-

Competitions
[Continued 'from page i] 
Dr. Steinberg — head, general 
studies MMCC.
Mr. R.. Carman—track coach.
- A total of six relays has been 
decided upon. Specific details 
about the types of relays will be 
withheld until the day of c 
petition. Possibly two of the 
lays will be announced in the next 
issue of the Tartan. Relays will 
take place Friday, May 10 at 3:15 
on Fine Arts lawn.
The equipment needed for the 
relays will be supplied mostly by 
the groups participating and are 
items easily found in one's home, 
neighborhood,-or local stores. It is 
suggested that participants look 
for relay - equipment in their 
homes rather than buy it. Three 
trophies áre to be awarded for 
this event.
The plank-jousting competition 
this year is open to any male or­
ganization on campus. Each group 
may enter one or more teams. 
Trophies- for the female relays 
and the plank-jousting will also 
be presented on Saturday night 
at the dance.
Congress—
[Continued from pnge 1] 
elect will automatically become a 
member of the Congress. At the 
meeting on May 7, the two offices 
will be filled-by a majority vote 
of both old and new members. 
Any campaigning on the part of 
the nominees is up to the indi­
vidual’s discretion providing that 
publicity on the Cut Is approved.
Norm Achilles, the 1956-57 con­
gress chairman, stated, “This year 
we have succeeded in ironing out 
the kinks.in the constitution and 
setting up the coordinating groups. 
We have run across many unfor- 
seen problems and have suggested 
various solutions to them. It will 
be up to the new congress and the 
newly-elected leaders to put into 
effect these solutions and to utilize 
the coordinating groups in build­
ing up and maintaining a strong, 
influential student government.”
“Next year I hope to see the 
trend toward including everyone 
in school events emphasized. This 
year the Spring Carnival commit­
tee called upon volunteers from 
the general student body and dele­
gated authority to them. Next 
year Homecoming and Carnival 
will provide two more opportuni­
ties for greater student-wide par­
ticipation."

Modern Building 
Materials Display 
In Fine Arts
The imaginative exploitation of 
new' building materials and tech­
niques by modern architects and 
engineers is the subject of the ex­
hibition "Structure and Space in 
Contemporary Engineering,” 
which opened at Hewlett Gallery, 
Carnegie College of Fine Arts on 
April 22 and runs through May 
10.
Each of the five sections ¿f the 
exhibition is devoted to a partic­
ular -type of construction. The 
earliest is the arch-rib system, 
used in masonry construction 
since the middle ages. With the 
development of industrial steel iii 
the 19th century, however, it be­
came possible to span much great­
er spaces than ever before. Rein­
forced concrete, à. 20th century in­
vention, ' combined the tensile 
strength of steel with great light­
ness and flexibility, giving rise to 
new forms and producing continu­
ous surfaces that simultaneously 
perform the functions of support 
and shelter.
The next section of the exhibi­
tion illustrates one of- the most 
efficient applications of reinforced 
concrete thin-shell construc­
tion.
A series of sports arenas utilizing 
the principle of cantilevered con­
struction make up. the exhibition’s 
third section. In these stadia, huge 
sheltering extensions float over 
space with no apparent means of 
support. The strength of these 
daring structures is attained 
through their shape and" results 
from their designers’ skillful ex­
ploitation of the great plasticity of 
reinforced concrete.
In the structures which fol-
low, a lattice network System is 
used to solve the problem 'of shel­
ter through lightweight spans. 
Multiple thin, delicate member* 
replace the individual large and 
heavy l supporting elements of 
other systems. The exhibition con­
cludes with a group of buildings 
and projects that utilize the tensile 
properties of steel.
CFP Action—
[Continued from page 11. 
last week's meeting in the form 
of two week’s social probation for 
the three- fraternities. This was 
done for “not exercising proper 
control over their members and 
for permitting ungentlemanly be­
havior.” Because certain “star" 
witnesses were missing, final re­
tribution was not meted out. This 
is the function of tomorrow’s 
hearing.
