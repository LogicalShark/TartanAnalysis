The lecturer last Thursday morning 
at the regular hour was Mr. John Wil­
liams, President of the Amalgamated 
Association of Iron and Steel Work­
ers, who took for his subject, “Labor 
Organizations.” Mr. Williams is a 
convincing speaker and an accom­
plished orator, and tried to show 
what Labor Unions stand for, and 
how they have been misjudged and 
persecuted. His points were some­
what as follows:
First of all the' Unions claim the 
right to organize and protest for their 
rights. They are willing to grant the 
same privilege to capital for its pro­
tection, provided it is not to smash La­
bor. The Labor Union is not the La­
bor Question. Wipe out the Union 
and the Question would be worse. 
Deny the right to organize and an­
archy would soon result.
Like all reform movements, the 
Labor movement has been misjudged 
and persecuted. The charge that the 
Union demands equal earnings for all 
workers is not true, but every capable 
man should be paid a minimum liv­
ing wage. The Union has never tried 
to compel an employer to hire in­
competent workmen. Improvements 
in machinery should continue to be 
made, for by this means, the drudgery 
of the laborer is lessened.
The Labor Unions stand for a lib­
eral proportion of the good things of 
this world for its members; for the 
enlightenment of the ignorant work­
ers; the emancipation of children from 
slavery; for women workers condi­
tions unspotted, and for all mankind 
release from the bondage of indus­
trial slavery. The Unions believe that 
industrial schools are needed, for by 
this means education may be 
broadened. Children should not be 
compelled to go to the High Schools 
unless they want to, for they may be 
in no way fitted to pursue such a 
course of training.
Mr. Williams closed his speech by 
a plea for co-operation between the 
labor unions and capital, saying that 
the former at least stood upon the 
Golden Rule, and by this means only 
can every one concerned get a square 
deal.

The Musical Clubs performed be­
fore a packed house in New Brighton 
last Friday night. Every member was 
applauded generously for encores, so 
pleased was the audience with the 
music. The Mandolin Club’s rendi­
tion of the Fantasie aus Tell followed 
by Shubert’s Serenade as an encore, 
and the Glee Club’s Octette with its 
piano, were the hits of the evening. 
The piano stunt engineered by Gris­
wold, brought down the house and 
the mechanical method of acknowl­
edging the applause was equally well 
received. The trip home, as usual, 
was the most enjoyable part of the 
evening for club members.
The clubs had a private car for the 
evening and on the return trip things 
were so merry that an audience soon 
appeared from the next coach. On 
such occasions as this one has the 
best opportunity of hearing what the 
clubs really can do offhand, and with­
out preparation, with music other 
than that on the regular program.

A Design School smoker was held 
Friday evening, March 22nd, at the 
University Club. About forty-five 
students and many of the Faculty at­
tended, and a rousing good time was 
afforded all. Mr. Hornbostel was able 
to be present and had much encour­
agement regarding the new Design 
building and the laying of the corner­
stone to occur. Remarks by others 
of the Faculty and the usual stories 
and jokes were in order, completing 
a most enjoyable and successful cele­
bration.

With each rehearsal the prospects 
for this year’s play by the White 
Friars grows more and more promis­
ing, and the outlook for a brilliant 
production brighter. Each passing 
rehearsal night sees the candidates in 
better trim, picking up the steps with 
greater ease and confidence; learning 
the little tricks that make for grace 
and effect in dancing and a change 
in the quality of enthusiasm and spirit 
displayed. At the first tryout curi­
osity was perhaps the dominant fea­
ture in the spirits of the men present. 
Subsequently, curiosity has changed 
to knowledge and with this knowl­
edge of the character of work done 
by the Friars, and required of the 
men in the chorus and cast, has come 
a firmer, saner, > cooler enthusiasm 
which if rightly directed, wisely play­
ed upon, will mean success.
Coach Edmundson has announced 
this year’s play to be “His Highness, 
the Chef,” a clever, two-act musical 
comedy, written by him, especially 
for the White Friars, and first played 
by them in the Spring of 1909. This 
second production of the play is the 
observance and following of a policy 
outlined some years ago, that in every 
fifth year, the best play of the preced­
ing four years should be revived, re­
written and presented as a special an­
niversary celebration. Mr. Edmund­
son is now engaged in rearranging 
a few minor details in plot and action 
which will add materially to the pomp 
and sparkle of the several parts.
It is the plan of the Board of Gov­
ernors to stage this year’s play not in 
a lavish display, but in a very finished 
form. Small dancing and singing 
choruses, but well drilled and pol­
ished to a high degree and composed 
of men than whom there is no bet­
ter to be found, for their particular 
parts.
Last Monday night Mr. Edmund­
son made his selection of the cast 
string, from which final part assign­
ments wTill be made at the earliest pos­
sible moment. Tuesday night the 
same process of elimination was ap­
plied to the chorus candidates. In 
an early issue of the Tartan will ap­
pear the lists of final sections for 
both cast and chorus. When joint 
rehearsals are well under way, it is 
the intention of the Board of Govern­
ors to have a special White Friars 
issue of the Tartan, in which the his­
tory of the organization will be told, 
together with much interesting mat­
ter about previous shows and the 
plays of other years.
It is earnestly urged upon all can­
didates for this year’s show that at­
tendance at rehearsals is an import­
ant item in the consideration of quali-

The Westinghouse Club of Wil- 
kinsburg won an interesting indoor 
dual track meet from Carnegie Tech 
by a score of 51 points to 37. The 
good work of East and Harris of 
Westinghouse, together with the 
home team’s familiarity with the 
track, was responsible for our defeat. 
In the straight-away dashes and the 
jumps our men showed superiority, 
and, on a larger track, several of our 
stars could have made a more credit­
able showing.
This was shown in the 300-yard 
dash, especially “Chuck” Crawford 
and Holliday were entered against 
Edwards and Signor. On the first 
lap, Crawford lost time at the turns, 
which were sharp and dangerous. He 
rapidly cut down the lead of the two 
Westinghouse men until, on the last 
half lap he was about to pass them. 
This end of the track was hidden 
from spectators and officials by a high 
board partition, and no one but the 
three runners concerned knew exact­
ly what happened. The two West­
inghouse men were the only ones to 
emerge from behind the screen, while 
Crawford had to be helped from 
where he had fallen. The circum­
stances were suspicious, bearing out 
Crawford’s allegation of fouling.
The winning of the relay race by 
the Wilkinsburgers was also due more 
to familiarity with the track than to 
superior speed. Their men took the 
short turns faster than our runners, 
but on the straight-aways were un­
able to show their heels to an ap­
preciable extent.
Wait ran the one-mile race with a 
scarcely healed broken arm and 
pushed East all of the way in spite 
of lack of recent training, finishing 
a close second.
The potato race caused consider­
able amusement to the spectators. 
Four men competed in the first trial 
heat, but the last man was the only 
one who put all of his potatoes in the 
receptacle. Hall carried his last one 
over the finishing tape and endeav­
ored to smuggle it to a spectator, but 
was caught in the act. The second 
heat men behaved better.
The Plaid high-jumpers had every­
thing to themselves, placing one, two, 
three. H. Murphy and Cronin fought 
for first place, but the former won 
at 5 feet 8*4 inches. This beats the 
school record by 2J4 inches.
1 Cronin won over Capt. Boots in the 
broad jump, with a leap of 19 feet 
3 inches. The team should hold the 
jumps against any of the local col­
leges this year.

It will be remembered that last year 
The Tartan ran what it called The 
Dean’s Column, to which each of the 
Deans contributed one letter a month. 
This feature was well liked, we believe, 
and arrangements have been made to 
start it again, the first article appearing 
in the issue of April 11th. There will 
be seven articles in all, The Director, 
the Deans, the Registrar, and the Secre­
tary each writing one. The Tartan 
trusts that these letters will be as much 
appreciated and enjoyed as were those 
published last year.
Along the street on which one of the 
buildings fronts, pass no inconsiderable 
number of strangers. A large number 
of these are members of the sex 
towards which the rest of mankind is 
supposed to exhibit the utmost cour­
tesy. It has been noticed that some of 
the students whose class and drafting 
rooms are on the street side of that 
building have been so forgetful and ne­
glectful of what is a fitting and proper 
behavior as to cause by their actions 
much annoyance to these passers-by. It 
is to be regretted that these few men 
are able, by virtue of their location, to 
besmirch the reputation of the entire 
student-body. If they can not or will 
not conduct themselves as gentlemen, 
then they should be removed to some 
portion of the buildings where they will 
not be possessed of the opportunity to 
subject to annoyance those who may 
chance to pass our door.
—o—
THE STRAW VOTE AND A SUG­
GESTION.
The straw vote being taken today on 
the presidential situation promises to 
be interesting and to serve the supposed 
purpose of all such contests. It sug­
gests a thought, however, which will, 
if carried out, prove far more valuable 
and beneficial to those participating 
than a thousand voting contests. We 
mean the formation of a Civic Society. 
The Tartan has long been under the 
impression that the average student 
knew much too little concerning what 
the reviewers call “the burning questions 
of the day.” This may be due in part 
to the amount of work each student is 
required to carry, and the limited 
amount of time he has to investigate 
such questions, but that is not the main 
reason for this lack of information and 
interest. It is due mainly, in our opin­
ion, to the fact that there is at the 
present time no gathering together of 
those students whose interests lie in that 
direction, with the consequential lack of 
systematic discussion, without which it 
is well-nigh impossibl to breed a deep, 
lasting, and intelligent understanding 
of these questions. With the formation 
of such a society it would be possible 
to not only have general discussions, 
but to obtain speakers not otherwise 
obtainable, men qualified to touch upon 
such subjects. This again would result 
in a more general diffusion of the in­
formation concerning the present day 
problems.
After our short stay in this institu­
tion we are graduated, expecting and 
expected to take up our share of the 
burden which falls upon the citizens of 
this or any other country. We are ex­
pected to do even more than our share, 
being the recipients of unusual educa­
tional opportunities, and it should be our 
pleasure to do this. The community 
looks to us for its leaders and it is 
only right that we should prepare our­
selves as intelligently as possible for 
such leadership. This we are not doing 
when we fail to keep in touch with 
those great happenings which are taking 
place beyond our walls. Most of us 
could not be expected at the present 
time to pass intelligent judgment upon 
the questions before the people of this 
country today because we have not in­
telligently studied them. If formed, it 
should be one of the aims of this so­
ciety to relieve this situation and make 
its members more fit to take their places 
in the communities in which they will 
live and work.
In various colleges and universities 
in this country there already exist these 
civic societies. These individual socie­
ties have formed a federation which 
holds yearly meetings in New York 
City. At this meeting a plan is laid 
down so that the individual societies 
may do the most efficient work and ob­
tain the most benefit from such work. 
This movement on the part of the col­
lege men is an important one and re­
ceives the backing of all thinking men. 
The Tartan would like to see a move­
ment along similar lines inaugurated at 
Carnegie. Whether connection was 
made with the federated societies or 
not is a question which could be easily 
worked out later. The first step is to 
organize our own local society. From 
now until November 12th promises to 
be one of a most interesting periods of 
our national history and no better time 
could be selected for the formation of 
such an organization. The Tartan sub­
mits the suggestion to the studenty-body 
generally, sincerely trusting that it will
receive the consideration which it mer­
its.
HAVE YOU 
CANCELLED YOURS?
We are in receipt of the folowing 
communication which we place before 
the attention of the student body:
To Whom It May Concern:
The financial condition of the Ath­
letic Association has reached a point 
where it is impossible to meet any 
more of the student notes until this 
fall.
If the treasury is put in a position 
to redeem more of the notes soon, 
notice of same will be published in 
the Tartan.
ALBERT E. WOOD, JR., 
Treasurer.
The Tartan is glad to make note of 
the fact that Treasurer Wood is tak­
ing such prompt action to keep the 
treasury of the Athletic Association 
from becoming hard pressed. Now 
it is up to the students who hold 
such notes to give a real sample of 
Carnegie Tech school spirit. Many 
have already done so by cancelling the 
notes which they hold. More can 
and should do so. You may not have 
the fact published about you, that your 
fellow-students may give you credit 
for it, but your act will be appreciated 
by those who know, and more than 
all, by yourself.
Now is your chance! Send notice 
to Wood that you have donated some­
thing to the cause of athletics in Car­
negie Tech.
—o—
AN OBJECT LESSON.
Now that the curtain has been rung 
down on the basketball season, we, 
supposed to be experts on all ques­
tions, are expected to present to our 
readers excuses for a season that was 
not exactly victorious. As none of the 
Tartan staff represented this institu­
tion in the winter sport, we have no 
hesitation in saying that our opinion 
is unbiased.
Having settled that matter of detail, 
let us turn to the score book for a 
brief review. Our varsity team played 
twelve games with other colleges, 
three of which they won; and seven 
games with other organizations, of 
which two go to our credit. In the
collegiate games our men won 267
points to our opponents’ 350, 
which looks better than the record 
of games. A total of points scored 
by our team for the season was 455 in 
19 games, while our opponents se­
cured 583. This makes our average
game loss to other college teams by 
a score of 29 to 22, and the total aver­
age score a loss by 31 to 24.
Now for the reasons, as we see 
them. Captain W. R. Williams was 
the only man from last year’s team 
that reported for the first practices— 
the team was built up of new men al­
most entirely. Accident disabled the 
only other experienced man, Keltz, 
and he took part in but three games, 
and played at a distinct disadvantage. 
Faculty action, resulting from the mid­
year examinations, removed two other 
men just when they were' becoming
useful. But lastly,—and mainly,—lack 
of interest in the sport was the major 
contributory cause. Men with real 
basketball ability and the weight that 
would have helped us in many games 
played in the school tournament, but 
refused to come out for the varsity. 
Or, worse still, they stood back, 
watched our men playing their best 
against unequal odds, and established 
a reputation by expert criticism. They 
may get undue credit from us, at that! 
More often they stayed at home, went 
to the show, or burned the gas at the 
expense of some girl’s father’s pocket- 
book while our five was playing with­
out their support in this city. Can any 
team be expected to win when its 
supporters don’t give a hang about 
the results until after the game has 
been played?
Now, let us pay some tribute to 
those who did play, to those who prac­
ticed night after night, and tried, at 
least, to bring victory and honor to 
Carnegie Tech. Capt. “Ray” Williams 
played in 16 of the 19 games, and 
scored 34 field goals. Although light 
for a college forward, he played well 
throughout the season and captained 
his team creditably. Colvin played 
in every game, losing but 15 minutes 
of the game against the Faculty. He 
scored 45 times from the floor and 116 
times from the foul line out of 231 
tries, which gives him a score of 206 
points. Kesselman played in every 
college game without losing a minute. 
His guarding saved us from over­
whelming defeat in more games than 
one, although he scored but 7 times. 
Yahres played in 9 games and scored 
17 field goals, while his fast floor work 
helped our team tremendously. Hall 
and Heisel were two extra players 
that could be counted on whenever 
needed. The former scored 11 times 
in 12 games, while the latter tallied 
10 times. Douthett participated in 
the first 8 games and scored 16 field 
goals and 13 out of 388 fouls. Keltz, 
playing in but three games scored 8 
baskets. Dave Williams tallied 9 
times in 7 games, and Ruth twice in 
two games. Simpson, Savage, Vaughn 
and Bearinger all deserve credit for 
hard work on the scrubs, and took 
part at least once on the varsity.
The Tartan hopes that this object 
lesson may bring results, not only to 
basketball teams of the future, but to 
all of our athletic teams and other 
student activities. We need student 
support.
---------------o---------------
There are two things about Easter 
Vacation which are not pleasant to think 
about. First, it is not nearly long 
enough; secondly, it is followed by 
those examinations for the removal of 
conditions. It is fortunate that the 
first objection is the one most gener­
ally felt, but for those who chance to 
be afflicted with the second the agony 
is intense.
The man who could discover a sure 
cure for “Spring Fever” would make 
his fortune selling it in barrel lots 
around this institution.
Those learned gentlemen, the Sport­
ing Editors, tell us that there never 
was a real “come back.” What’s the 
matter with our Muddy Trail?

Last Saturday night Dr. John A. 
Brashear delivered a lecture on Lilies 
and Roses for the benefit of the Hos­
pital School for Backward Children. 
The lecture was held at Carnegie 
Hall and was illustrated by scientific 
experiments and oral demonstrations 
of color. The men who had previous­
ly assisted Dr. Brashear in the con­
struction of the apparatus used, and 
who were on the stage to assist in 
the performing of the experiments 
were Prof. Hower, of the School of 
Applied Science and Messrs. Thaw 
and Ruckstahl. The speaker was in­
troduced by Mrs. Enoch Rauh, vice 
president of the Hospital School. The 
substance of the lecture consisted of 
the discussion of color phenomena, 
connected with flowers and the eye. 
Among the experiments performed 
were the following: Colors of thin 
films of oil and other substances; 
Newton’s rings; experiments with pol­
arized light; color demonstration of 
fatigue; the spectrum; colors of the 
setting sun produced by crystals in 
the path of the lantern and experi­
ments with sodium light. The lecture 
was a success and was fully appre­
ciated by the audience.---------------o---------------

A Canadian lawyer tells this story: 
A bailiff went out to levy on the 
contents of a house. The inventory 
began in the attic and ended in the 
cellar. When the dining room was 
reached, the tally of furniture ran 
thus:
“One dining room table, oak.
“One set chairs (6), oak.
“One sideboard, oak.
“Two bottles whisky, full.”
Then the word “full” was stricken 
out and replaced by “empty,” and the 
inventory went on in a hand that 
straggled and lurched diagonally 
across the page until it closed witht— 
“One revolving doormat.”

It is altogether too bad that the 
Deans’ offices can not see their way 
clear to make a ruling to the effect 
that studying the gyrations of spheres 
at that great laboratory, commonly 
known as Forbes Field, is a good and 
sufficient excuse for absence on a fine 
afternoon. It would save them and 
us so much trouble.

The Inter-Organization Basketball 
Tournament closed last Thursday at 6 
o’clock. The ninety games scheduled 
offered opportunity for the display of 
great rivalry among the classes and 
fraternities of the Schools, as well as 
giving many really good basketball 
games.
The Faculty started the season with 
every intention of leading the league, 
as they had a large number of former 
college stars on their roll. The Sci­
ence Plebes sprung a surprise on them 
by winning, as did Xi Sigma Up- 
silon.
The last named met defeat from the 
Science Plebes and also from the Tech 
Architectural Club, but finished first 
first by winning from the seven other 
teams.
Plebe Science lost to Sigma Tau 
and the Design School, while Sigma 
Tau were beaten by the Faculty and 
Xi Sigma Upsilon. Each of the first 
four teams claims the championship, 
and other games may be played to 
settle the claim.

She fell into his arms and he was

Picking up a copy of The Tartan 
not long since, we were interested, 
then amused, then startled, as we read 
the flea-like proportion of the “Grind” 
poor fellow! according to the writer 
of the note about him. In fact, it 
got “our goat” and we concluded to 
butt in.
First, we are reminded of the fit­
ness of a story attributed to Lincoln 
as most stories with a good point are. 
The story goes, that out on the fron­
tier of civilization somewhere in the 
50's, in a country school house in Illi­
nois, a crowd of boys and girls, young 
and old, were reading from the only 
reader they had in those days, the 
Bible.
The schoolmaster was a stern, 
crabbed old fellow, a perfect type of 
the old-fashioned men teachers, noted 
for their power to wield a beech gad 
rather than deliver intellectual goods 
for mental development. He had the 
class reading from the Third Chapter 
of Daniel, with its hard names, a ter­
ror to the uninitiated.
A little hunchback struck the verse 
containing those names so familiar 
to Sunday School scholars, Shadrach, 
Meshach and Abednego. He stum­
bled over the first; fell down on the 
second; and collapsed entirely on the 
third.
The schoolmaster looked at him for 
a few moments, then thundered out 
in a tone of voice that made the boy 
tremble, “Jim come here!” Jim 
walked meekly out and then the mas­
ter proceeded to wipe up some stray 
dust with poor Jim’s trousers.
He was then ordered back into line 
and the reading proceeded, as Jim’s 
sobs got less and less. To the foot 
of the class it passed then started in 
at the head again. Jim suddenly 
awakened, looked up at the one read­
ing, looked down at his book, then 
counted down the class to himself, 
then counted verses and, as he lo­
cated the one that would fall to him, 
let out a yell that would have put to 
blush a Sioux Indian on the war path. 
“Now Jim, what’s hit ye?” said the 
master in a more than usually kind 
voice. “O Master,” said the frighten­
ed Jim, “here comes them same d—d 
fellows again.”
Conclusion up to you, dear reader, 
and now to the subject.
What is a grind? Well, it’s the 
term, “Willie boys,” apply to a fel­
low who tries to get cash value, all 
wool and a yard wide, for the money, 
time and effort spent in securing that 
something that will never desert him, 
if only he uses it properly, namely, 
knowledge. In this country, the ques­
tion now is, “Can you make good?” 
not, “Who is your dad?” although 
this does seem to count sometimes. 
“How smart are you?” not, “How 
rich are you?” not, “How many neck­
ties or suits can you sport?” but the 
simple, straight question, “Are you 
onto your job?”
Friends, you are worth just as much 
to your employer as you give in hon­
est, efficient, earnest effort, not the 
fancy wages you think you ought to 
get, but don’t earn.
Now if the doctrine that the “Grind” 
is a miserable, dreamy, uncompanion­
able fellow, holds water and you be­
lieve it, then you have put yourself on 
record as one helping to knock out 
the thing most essential to success in 
any line of business, namely, getting 
to the bottom of things, for the grind 
is doing this and your attack on his 
personality is an attack upon his hab­
its, and all that they represent. My 
dear fellow student, you would not 
stand for a moment against what your 
own sense of honor tells-you is right? 
Of course you would .not. No self- 
respecting student, if he be a true 
American boy or girl, true to his or 
her home, city, state, nation, would 
stand for a moment in such false 
light.
What the times demand of us all 
is more honesty in work, and harder 
study of how to do that work easier, 
and then more contentment in our 
work. The boy and girl who must 
work for a living and hold their jobs 
—early learn the lesson of the so- 
called “Grind.”
It takes backbone and grit to come 
to school after a hard day’s work, 
but we are trying to better ourselves 
by what these schools, and the noble 
unselfish service of their teachers 
have to offer us.
Don’t get down in the mouth, Mr. 
Grind. Keep on grinding. You will 
sharpen an ax of business ability that 
one of these fine days will cut the 
props from under the little two by 
half that laughs at you.
Let me look forward twenty-five 
years and close with the following 
sketch from your private diary.
March 20, 1937—This was one of 
my strange days. Margaret, my secre­
tary, came in and told me that a poor 
fellow was outside asking for a quar­
ter. The project about the organiza­
tion of the new steel company had 
held me so closely that I wanted di­
version, so I said, “Show him in.” He 
came, and a tough looking guy he 
was. I wanted to find out about him 
and started a quiz.
He told me his story, the same old 
thing, good home, money, schooling, 
etc., and closed by saying, “What cuts 
me, now is, that I made fun of the 
fellows that were really trying to do 
something. Now I am down and out 
and only wish I could start again, but 
my health is gone and”—but he could 
say no more.
I passed him a “cart-wheel” for old 
times’ sake and he thanked me and 
was gone. I grew sort of dreamy, 
and dog rat it! some moisture came 
to my eyes; then I shook hands with 
myself and said, “Jake, old boy, Great

How’s this for dope, fellows? Is 
it too soapy? Well, it will make a 
lather which will soften the whiskers 
of this ancient Bromide, this ubiqui­
tous Sneer at the Grind, then we will 
give it a clean shave and turn it loose

AN EVENT OF APRIL.PETE AND BILL
The brilliant red steel frame work 
making its appearance above that 
shapeless rising area, widely known 
as the Muddy Trail, but technically 
as our “Campus,” betokens the ex­
istence at some future time, we re­
peat, some future time, of a housing 
for the School of Applied Design. Be­
yond that we know nothing—that is, 
on this subject. I retract, for there 
are two more facts, first,—the red of 
that steel work is—er—noticeable, and 
second—the cornerstone will be laid 
this year. But, as the proverb goes, 
there is many a day’s labor ’twixt lay­
ing the cornerstone and a lecture in 
a ventilated class room, with a really 
healthy lantern.
But, ah! the contemplation of that 
future time, comparable to the happy 
hunting ground and the Elysian Fields. 
Mere thoughts and holdings forth on 
that which the fates have in cold stor­
age for us, will suffice to bridge the j 
interminable span of years. But why 
thoughts of the distant future when 
the more immediate will produce an 
event of excitement, rumors of which 
were loosed at the Design School 
smoker last Friday night? We can 
offer no excuse for such a lack of 
sense of fitness and humbly attempt 
to cover our gross blunder by divulg­
ing all information we have obtained 
on the subject, which is the laying 
of the cornerstone sometime in late 
April.
It will mean the biggest time in the 
history of the School of Applied De­
sign, making necessary a complete re­
linquishing of every effort, other than 
at celebration, jollification and Bac­
chanalian revel (architectural for “big 
eats”). It will mean that during a 
period, when we shall forget T-squares 
and triangles, the campus will be dot­
ted with Greek philosophers, Egypt­
ian priests, Roman Senators, and Ren­
aissance artists as the architects’ “fig- 
gers” permit. Details of the event 
cannot yet be stated accurately. How­
ever, Mr. Hornbostel, in his talks at 
the recent Design School, gave every 
evidence of his opinion that it should 
be decidedly different and worthy of 
extensive preparation.
“But try, I urge, the trying shall 
suffice.
The aim, if reached or not, makes 
great the life.”

The following interesting lines, of 
but which have long drifted about in 
the newspapers, contain all the stock 
comparisons most frequently used in 
conversation, arranged in such a 
manner as to rhyme. The poem, if 
it can so be called, has been rescued 
from oblivion by Miss Carlyn Wells 
in “A Whimsey Anthology.”

OUTDOOR PRACTICE.
The Japanese government has re­
cently presented Yale University with 
a silver cup as a token of its appre­
ciation of the relief fund of five hun­
dred dollars which the Japanese stu­
dents of the University raised during 
the Russio-Japanese War.
Fair weather will mean that the 
baseball team will begin outdoor prac­
tice next week. Manager Manker is 
negotiating for the use of a field near 
the gym, until Tech field gets into 
shape. The coaches expect to have 
the team in the pink of condition for 
the State game. As the opening game 
is only three weeks away, practice 
every night when the team gets out­
doors, will be the order. The trouble 
experienced by being unable to get 
the pitchers into condition for the 
opening game in former years will 
be a special feature. To make the 
team this year the coaches insist 
that not only must a man’s fielding 
be up, but that he be a good sticker. 
It is the opinion of the coach that 
more college men are weak in Hit­
ting than anything else. Special ef­
forts will be made to develop hitters.
It is hoped that the schedule for the 
j second team will be developed enough 
to publish by next week’s issue. The 
| schedule will include all the «trcng 
local high and prep schools. The 
second team will play through the 
season with a regularly elected cap­
tain. It has been rumored that some 
sort of insignia will be awarded the 
men who play on the second team 
through the season.

The Glee and Mandolin Clubs had 
concerts last week on Tuesday night 
in the chapel of the First Presbyterian 
Church of Pittsburgh, before the dif­
ferent departments of that institution, 
and on Friday night in the Auditorium 
of the Wilkinsburg High School, for 
the Wilkinsburg Club.
The program for the Church Con­
cert was practically the same as 
that of the Home Concert. Griswold’s 
old pipe organ and octette of dum­
mies was there, but the octette was 
reduced to a sextette on account of 
the absence of some of the “pipes.” 
As a matter of fact, both Clubs were 
handicapped by the absence of sev­
eral members, and by considerable 
noisiness on the part of the public, 
especially during the first part of the 
program.
The audience consisted largely of 
rather immature members of the Sun­
day school classes, and the Rev. Dr. 
Maitland Alexander twice had to re­
quest silence before it was possible 
to fully enjoy the excellent entertain­
ment. However, the young people’s 
hilarious state was due largely to their 
hearty appreciation of the music.
Witness the fact that while arrange­
ments were made to let them go down 
for refreshments in groups, so as not 
to exceed the capacity of the church’s 
restaurant, several of the youngsters 
would rather sacrifice their “eats” 
than miss part of the program. To 
do them full justice it must also be 
mentioned that absolute silence pre­
vailed during Mr. Hodgdon’s rendi­
tion of “My Sunshine Rose.” It is 
hoped that “Amici” at the opening 
and “Alma Mater” at the close of the 
program informed the audience in 
very expressive language as to the 
identity of the people that were play­
ing before them.
At the Wilkinsburg High School 
the program was somewhat modified, 
in fact, the Musical Clubs supplied 
only part of the entertainment. The 
Lyric Quartette, “formerly of Tech 
Glee Club,” and now members of 
the Wilkinsburg Club, took care of 
the other half. The Lyric Quartette 
still consists of Messrs. R. & E. 
Hodgon, R. Crawford and R. R. Rose. 
The Quartette sang many popular 
songs and four solos were rendered 
by its members. The last number on 
the program was a pantomime of 
Camp Life, performed by members 
of the Wilkinsburg Club. With the 
exception of the Home Concert, this 
was the best concert put on this sea­
son. Success is believed -to be due 
largely to the excellent accoustic 
properties of the Auditorium, which 
are almost identical with those of the 
Carnegie Music Hall.

Most musical clubs practically dis­
band after the Flome Concert has 
been rendered. Ours don’t. They 
are now working as hard as ever. 
Two difficult but successful concerts 
were given last week, a detailed 
account of which will be found else­
where in this issue. A schedule has 
now been worked out which will keep 
the clubs busy until next June. The 
Clubs are being pushed harder than 
ever before, both by their officers and 
by the public. At almost every con­
cert put on this year, requests came 
in for more concerts at other places. 
It is not impossible that next vacation 
an Easter trip will be attempted.
Already discussions are being held 
concerning next year’s campaign. 
Without any doubt a Christmas trip 
will be undertaken and many brilliant 
ideas have thus far been submitted 
regarding next year’s Home Concert. 
Some original and new features will 
be introduced. There will not only 
be a Glee Club, but a Glee Club with 
more appropriate settings in the way 
of scenery and illumination.
There is no reason why in this re­
spect the Carnegie Musical Clubs 
should not occupy a place distinctive­
ly their own. They have in their 
midst men of ability and with a spe­
cialized education that almost no 
other college clubs can boast of They 
have men of the Design School that 
can furnish artistic plans for original! 
scenery; men of the Industries Schpol j 
that can take care of its construction; 
men of the Science school that can 
look after the numerous complicated 
wiring jobs and solve the illumina­
tion problems that are always in­
volved when attractive scenery is to 
be produced.
The management of the Clubs has 
decided that next year much more i 
publicity shall be given to club mat­
ters than has heretofore been done. 
The Clubs will be brought before the 
public in a more efficient manner. Ef­
fective advertising media will be used. 
A descriptive prospectus will be 
printed and distributed. We hope to 
be able to publish some more definite 
statements regarding this prospectus 
in next week’s issue. It is earnestly 
hoped that the members of the Glee 
and Mandolin Clubs will be able to 
maintain a satisfactory scholastic 
standing while they are carrying such 
a heavy burden and are making the 
name of Carnegie famous.

nhe uCming uhallenge frCm the bastl
“The Chinese woman stands on the 
threshold of a new era and offers a 
challenge to the woman of the west. 
Can she take it up,” asked Miss Clara 
L. West, dean of the Margaret Morri­
son Carnegie School, yesterday after­
noon of the members of the Wednes­
day current events class in the Fort 
Pitt Hotel.
“The women of the east have long 
established customs and unless the 
women of the west can offer substi­
tutes which are more adequate the 
eastern women will be able to speak 
the last word in this struggle of the 
feminine of the Occident against the 
onrush of the womanhood of the Ori­
ent.
“The appearance and expression of 
a nation in dressing is indicative of 
its knowledge of the value of clothes; 
their suitableness, usefulness and 
beauty. Are American women ever 
going to do any thinking of their 
own? They are the most enclaved 
women of the world in that respect. 
These yellow women standing at the 
gate of the orient have many ques­
tions to ask. What does this mean? 
What does that symbolize? Why do 
you wear uncomfortable shoes when 
we have discarded our foot-binding? 
they will say to the women of Amer­
ica.
“If dress means anything it means 
the individual taste, the expression of 
the personality of the wearer. The 
exquisitely embroidered head dresses 
of the women of Europe, the real lace 
mantillas and the jewels of the women 
of Spain and the scarfs of the Italian 
women represent family pride, for 
they have been handed down from 
generation to generation, the daugh­
ter—receiving from the mother the 
same lace and jewels which were worn 
by her grandmother and great grand­
mother.
“If we mean to be able to answer 
this challenge of the yellow woman 
intelligently and with dignity we must 
develop a study of dress. There are 
no extravagances or extremes in fash­
ion in the old countries. The old 
world can teach us much. There may 
be thousands of things in China worse 
than we have here, yet there is one 
thing the Chinese have that we must 
acknowledge and that is the sense of 
color.
“The revolution in China is like 
that of the middle ages when the cities 
rose against the imperial power rep­
resented by the distant emperor and 
the Holy Roman Empire fell. The 
cities rose because of their develop­
ment of the industrial arts. Through 
them the people in the cities had be­
come stronger than the imperial pow­
er and they knew that they were 
stronger. In China the same thing 
had happened. In all the outlying 
provinces the people had to have some 
government of their own. They were 
so far from the imperial government 
that they could not wait for the im­
perial edict to reach them to plant 
the seed or to quell a riot. So in a 
way they governed themselves, grew
stronger and have broken away from 
that imperial government as was done 
in the middle ages.
“The hope of China lies in its wom­
en. There are now club women in 
China, women of all castes, meeting 
together. This is not the change of 
a day, but has been growing for a 
century. The yellow women are look­
ing to America for a standard of liv­
ing in their new era. We shall be 
put to the challenge. Will American 
women permit their standard of dress 
to be governed by commercial greedy 
money-makers or will we display an 
intelligent taste and discrimination.
“I have been asked, by people inter­
ested in the revolution in China,” said 
Miss West, “to furnish some books 
which will be translated into Chinese 
and used by the girls in the high 
schools. The subjects which will be 
included in the list treat of psychol­
ogy, history of education, physiology, 
chemistry for women, human foods 
and the care of children. The Chin­
ese women of the future will have a 
mind of her own.
“If the American clubs and feder­
ations will take up the question of 
dress there is no reason why in SO 
years there cannot be a beauty, fit­
ness, harmony, and development of 
correct taste, in the dress of the na­
tion.”
At the April meeting of the Alum­
nae (M. M. C. S.) which is to be held 
in the School Parlors, Saturday, April 
6th, at 3 o’clock, Dr. John A. Brash- 
ear will speak on the subject of “Edu­
cators and Others o Met Abroad.” 
At the tea following the lecture, Dr. 
Brashear will be the guest of honor. 
Hostess for the day, Miss Helen 
Oursler; Class Representative, ’10, 
will be assisted by Miss Elizabeth 
Kelly, ’10, who will pour tea, and by 
the Misses Anna Cote, ’10, Mary 
Wight, ’11, Mamie Hawkins, ’11, Ruth 
Turkle, ’11, Madeline Meese, ’10, and

The best schedule ever arranged 
for a track team of Carnegie Tech 
has just been completed by Manager
H. C. Franks. It includes meets with 
three of the largest colleges and uni­
versities of the East, known over the 
whole country for their strong teams 
and individual stars.
What promises to be the hardest, 
as well as the best, meet of the year 
for Carnegie will be a triangular meet 
with the University of Pennsylvania 
and the Carlisle Indian School, which 
will be held on Franklin Field in Phil­
adelphia on Msy 11. Penn and Car­
lisle have some of the greatest all- 
around athletes in America, but our 
men are intent on taking enough 
places to make the final results as 
close as will be possible.
Another big meet will be a dual con­
test with Pennsylvania State and State 
College on June 10, v/hich date is their 
Commencement Day Penn State al­
ways put out good track teams, almost 
on a par with their other athletic 
teams, and the meet will not. be en­
tirely one-sided for Carnegie.
relay team will be sent to the 
big annual relay races in Philadelphia 
on April 27, held under the auspises 
of the University of Pennsylvania. In 
these races our team will compete
GALLEY EIGHT .................................
against Oberlin, Western Reserve, W.
& J., Vanderbilt, Pitt, Lehigh, Villa- 
nova, Ursinus, University of Mary­
land, Dickinson, Allegheny, Univer­
sity of Missouri, etc.
The two big meets to be held on 
Carnegie Field will be the third annual 
interschools meet, held on April 20th, 
and a dual meet with Westminster Col­
lege, May 4th. On this date the sec­
ond interscholastic meet will be held 
in conjunction with this dual meet and 
will thus enable the track enthusiasts 
of Pittsburgh to see the best high 
school and college track teams in 
Pittsburgh perform. Westminster al­
ways has a strong team, but they, 
like all other colleges, will go down 
to defeat before the Tech team.
Following is the schedule for the 
season of 1911-1912:
March 9, 1912—P. A. A. Indoor Meet, 
Duquesne Garden.
March 23, 1912—Westinghouse Club 
vs, Tech, Indoor Meet, Wilkinsburg, 
April 20, 1912—Third Annual Inter- 
schools Meet, Carnegie Field.

Extract from letter from Miss 
Kitty McMullen, ’09 Secretarial, now 
missionary in Tunghiang, China.
Would it not be a wonderful thing 
if the Alumnae Association of the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School 
for Women would establish a branch 
school in this land of China and give 
the girls of China a fair chance, or, 
establish a school here in honor of 
Mr. Carnegie’s daughter, Margaret 
Carnegie. My idea is this—give your 
prerogatives, your ideals, your best 
girls for teachers—an9 your money. 
Your settlement work is noble and 
very needy I grant you, but girls, 
they have something of a chance and 
these girls have none. As I write this 
my eyes are turned toward the beauti­
ful snow falling around us, but my 
heart is heavy, for it means that hun- 
I dreds of poor and starving people are 
| freezing to death—going into eternity 
I with no hope.
Girls I do not know how many of 
| you have stayed and listened to all 
' this, but I just want to say, I should 
j love to hear from any of you at any 
i time.

The misguided Faculty in its guile­
less poverty of up-to-snuffness has 
been hugging a delusion to its con­
cave bosom. It has all along cher­
ished the absurd idea that the primary 
aim of these schools is engineering 
education. That its students have 
given up their reluctant cash for the 
purpose of saturating their still more 
reluctant minds with knowledge to 
the end that they may tinker with the 
world’s machinery for profit. It is 
a grievous error. This engineering 
obsession is a mere incident, it seems, 
to the grave business of smearing the 
countenances of disciples from rival 
institutions with the grime of the ath­
letic arena. The motto is apparently 
“if athletics interfere with your ed­
ucation give up your education.”
How are these tottering patriarchs 
of the Faculty to know with what 
enthusiasm employers of budding en­
gineers receive the information that 
their offices have been blessed with 
the star punter or the immortal third 
baseman, even if the latter does’nt 
know the difference between the co­
efficient of friction and the “house 
maids’ knee?” Oh how vastly more 
is prized, in the industrial world, a 
knowledge of, the “out drop” or of 
the forward pass than trivial informa­
tion about mechanics and math. 
It is pathetic to sav the least that 
these persecutors of the struggling 
young athlete should be so moved 
by what they conceive to be a sense 
of duty toward parents and toward 
the victim himself, to say nothing of 
the absurd devotion to the activities 
for which they receive their muni­
ficent salaries, as to insist on his at­
tendance and participation in the 
childish pursuit of wisdom.
It is evident, is it not to anyone 
who saw these vindictive souls shiv­
ering, blue-nosed, on the bleachers last 
Fall, stuttering with excitement over 
the thrilling spectacle of passing the 
ball, and having pictures taken, that 
their real object was to select burnt 
offerings for the monthly holocaust? 
It will soon be the open season for 
track men, and isn’t it a bloody 
shame, that just because there is no 
much needed engineering course in 
leg muscles, some worthy pairs will 
be deprived of the excitement of ap­
proaching the Adamic costume in 
public without offending some chaste 
policeman?
Apparently the age limit specified 
for admission to the Schools is much 
too low; if one mav judge by the 
artless prattle upon this ancient sub­
ject.
The obvious truth is that there is 
probably no other purely educational 
institution in the land, where so many 
members of the Facultv are deeply I 
interested in athletics, and in the ! 
school’s athletic success. A very M 
large proportion are veteran athletes, i 
somewhat spavined, spring halt and I 
rheumatic now as to joints and mus­
cles, but spiritually frisky and enthu- j 
siastic. That they have come to 
the realty that life is longer than 
a hundred yard dash, and rather more I
extensive than a baseball diamond, 
makes at least one distinction between 
them and their educational wards still 
suffering from the intoxication of be­
ing 18 years old and from the attack 
of omniscience which belongs to that 
maturity.
It is the bitter wail of some with 
more colicy imagination than matur­
ity, that these dessicated specialists of 
the modern inquisition known as col­
lege education, gnash their teeth (or 
their gums if teeth have departed) 
at t'he mere thought of a student at 
play.
Why bless your soul, even if this 
fantastic delusion were fact, it is quite 
beyond their authority to prevent any­
one, though carrying a load of condi­
tions, to make him “sway-backed” 
from playing himself black in the 
face.
There is the gym and there the field. 
He can break as many bones, dislo­
cate as many joints, and add as much 
piquancy to the landscape with de­
tached portions of his anatomy as he 
lists.
Intercollegiate sport, so called, is 
not play, it is business with a liberal 
application of cosmetics and decidu­
ous hair, made up to appear youth­
ful and kittenish. It has too often 
a pungent fragrance unpopular in po­
lite society and more subterranean 
affiliations than Standard Oil. Like all 
other business it demands capital; of 
time, of strength, of application, and 
when the student with Olympian as­
piration is compelled to borrow, he 
appropriates these resources all too 
freely from the fund fondly supposed 
to be consecrated to the object of his 
presence in academic halls, and then 
when his instructors draw on him for 
the debt, he squeals and puts up a 
cheap and silly fiction, which he 
knows to be a poor relation of yel­
low journalism.
Even in the phantasma of under­
graduate life, it is rare indeed to “eat 
your cake and still have it.”

CARNEGIE TECHNICAL SCHOOLS : PITTSBURGH
T
^HE Carnegie Technical Schools consist of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
TchCCl Cf hpplie9 Tcience—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
TchCCl Cf hpplie9 cesign—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
TchCCl Cf hpplie9 on9ustries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec­
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
sargaret sCrrisCn uarnegie TchCCl—For women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be­
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
.ight uCurses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.
