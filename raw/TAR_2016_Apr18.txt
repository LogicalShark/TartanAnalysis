As a moderately sized crowd 
stood patiently at the edge of 
the College of Fine Arts (CFA) 
parking lot on Thursday after-
noon, the sound of bagpipes 
being played by the Pipes and 
Drums band signaled the start 
of the Midway Opening Cer-
emony. The student-created 
Booths were just ahead of the 
crowd, and behind them were 
numerous stands for food and 
carnival games. Over on the 
CFA lawn, a giant Ferris wheel 
and various other rides could 
be seen even by those at the 
edge of campus. With the sun 
shining down from a blue sky, 
the weather was pleasant and 
warm on the ?rst day of the 
102nd Spring Carnival, which 
was relatively unusual, but 
thoroughly suited the event.
After the Kiltie Band 
?nished a song, the Spring 
Carnival Chair, senior mathe-
matical sciences and computer 
science double major Patrick 
Koenig, stepped up to the 
microphone to welcome the 
crowd. Koenig thanked the rest 
of the Spring Carnival Commit-
tee for their work in organizing 
Carnival, and commented on 
the new location of the event, 
which had previously been 
held in the Morewood Parking 
Lot, but had to be moved this 
year due to the advent of the 
Tepper Quad. 
“I think this is really 
exciting because by now, booth 
and buggy are all sort of in the 
same location in the heart of 
campus ... I think it will really 
strengthen the traditions of 
Carnival for years to come,” 
remarked Koenig.
The Dean of Student Affairs, 
Gina Casalegno, also gave a 
brief welcome. Commenting 
on the weather, she stated, 
“What an auspicious day ... in 
the 15 years that I’ve had the 
opportunity to celebrate Spring 
Carnival ... I’ve never had such 
a perfect weather forecast.” 
Casalegno also remarked that 
she hoped the CFA parking 
lot and surrounding area 
would become the “?nal rest-
ing place” for Carnival, refer-
ring to the fact that Carnival 
has tended to move around 
throughout the years.
Casalegno also noted the 
high levels of Carnival partici-
pation among student organi-
zations, saying “We’ve got 25 
organizations who are partici-
pating, more than 23 percent of 
the undergraduate population 
participated in building Booth 
in less than six days’ creation 
... [and] 11 organizations [are] 
participating in Buggy.”
“Carnival is a time to 
celebrate some of the best of 
what Carnegie Mellon has to 
offer ... students from across all 
disciplines come together ... to 
celebrate the spirit of Carnegie 
Mellon, where hard work is en-
ergizing and inspired, where 
creativity is celebrated and 
harnessed, where teamwork 
and ‘interdisciplinary’ thrive, 
where passion is regularly the 
order of the day,” Casalegno 
said.
Casalegno thanked all 
those involved in making Car-
nival happen and cut the rib-
bon in front of Midway, of?-
cially kicking off Carnival, and 
the crowd streamed off in dif-
ferent directions to attend the 
festivities.

Graduating students speak at First Lectures series
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
This Wednesday marked 
the third and ?nal install-
ment of this year’s First Lec-
tures Series. The annual se-
ries, based on Randy Pausch’s 
novel The Last Lecture, allows 
graduating seniors to re?ect 
on what they have learned 
during their time at Carnegie 
Mellon and allows them to 
utilize the event as a platform 
to impart their own words 
of wisdom to current stu-
dents before they embark on 
their new journeys outside of 
Carnegie Mellon. 
This Wednesday, Obawole 
(Wole) Idowu, an electrical 
and computer engineering 
major, and Erik Pintar, a ?fth-
year electrical and computer 
engineering and human-
computer interaction dou-
ble major, joined the ranks 
of previous ?rst lectures 
speakers.
Wole Idowu’s Lecture
Idowu began his lecture by 
describing himself to be some-
what of a special case. Having 
graduated from high school at 
the age of 15, he initially wasn’t 
phased by the transition to col-
lege. That feeling didn’t last 
very long, however, after he re-
alized the challenges he would 
be facing such as more dif?cult 
schoolwork and racism. “For 
the ?rst time in my life I actu-
ally felt like I didn’t belong,” 
Idowu said.
Idowu did not let this keep 
him back. He found motivation 
in the many struggles he faced 
here at Carnegie Mellon and 
harnessed this to become a bet-
ter individual and student. “I 
was able to learn valuable les-
sons through the many faults I 
made to become a better per-
son and to grow even further 
than I did before,” Idowu said. 
He went on to list a couple 
of the lessons, or as he calls 
them the “keys to success,” he 
learned, which he titled with 
inspirations from music.
The ?rst key, which he calls 
“Hotline Bling,” involves learn-
ing how to ask for help when 
you are falling behind. “I used 
to call my teachers on the cell 
phone,” said Idowu, which was 
received with laughter from 
the audience. He recalls in-
teracting with teachers in his 
high school, asking them about 
their day and his performance 
in class. He notes, however, 
that he wasn’t really asking 
them for help, but rather how 
they were doing. He notes that 
as freshman we can sometimes 
be too prideful to ask for help. 
Idowu recalls his father tell-
ing him that “whether or not 
you want to admit to help ... 
it’s not stupid to ask for help.” 
After taking this advice his 
work improved and he noticed 
the advantages of taking the 
initiative to seek help when 
necessary.
The next key Idowu talked 
about was “Carpe Diem.” 
Idowu often refers to his expe-
riences with Professor David 
Kosbie, an associate teaching 
professor in the School of Com-
puter Science. Idowu explains 
that Kosbie would always tell 
him to “seize the day,” advice 
that he would often disregard 
with the excuse of being too 
busy to take part in certain 
things. Idowu recalls taking 
Kosbie’s advice during his 
sophomore year by taking the 
initiative to participate in work 
with wearable technology, a 
study that he had previously 
shown interest in. Idowu noted 
the valuable skills he learned 
by participating in this and 
just how bene?cial it can be to 
“seize the day.”
Idowu also discussed the 
bene?ts of “working smart, 
not hard.” He relays that if you 
think you are not cut out for a 
certain task, such as a class or 
speci?c major, try looking at 
it from a different approach. 
Nearing the end of his lecture, 
Idowu explained that all of us 
at Carnegi Mellon are not just 
a number, and we shouldn’t 
de?ne ourselves by our grades. 
He recalls his experience tak-
ing Physics II with Professor 
Kunal Ghosh and the struggles 
he faced with the class. By put-
ting time and energy into the 
class he was able to improve 
his grade. He recalls Ghosh en-
couraging him to “look outside 
of just this class” and the posi-
tive impact this had on him.
Idowu ended his lecture 
with advice he learned from 
his grandfather, which was 
“never settle for less than what 
you’re capable of.” He encour-
aged the audience to test their 
capabilities, not only to im-
prove academically, but also to 
change the world.

Carnival presents new changes and challenges
JADE CROCKEM

This year’s Spring Carnival 
saw several changes in terms 
of layout and location. From 
the relocation of Midway to the 
College of Fine Arts (CFA) park-
ing lot, to the rides being set up 
on CFA lawn, the 2016 Spring 
Carnival faced a new set of 
challenges. The chair of Spring 
Carnival Committee (SCC), se-
nior mathematical sciences and 
computer science major Patrick 
Koenig spoke to The Tartan 
about the changes to Carnival 
this year and the challenges 
that arose because of them.
Koenig initially commented 
on the positive aspects of 
Carnival’s relocation saying, 
“This move allowed the Spring 
Carnival Midway to be located 
closer to Sweepstakes [Buggy] 
and in the heart of Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus.”
Koenig was also asked about 
how the CFA lawn was chosen 
to be the future host of Carni-
val. “The process that resulted 
in choosing the CFA parking lot 
as the new home for the Spring 
Carnival Midway took place 
long before I was the Spring 
Carnival Chair,” Koenig said. 
“Originally the plan was for the 
relocation to take place for the 
2015 Spring Carnival. Howev-
er, construction delays for the 
new Tepper Quad resulted in 
this being pushed back to this 
year.” Koenig also explained 
that this move was not new 
information for most organiza-
tions. After having previously 
worked on Booth for the Mellon 
College of Science and being on 
Booth Committee, Koenig said, 
“I recall a presentation given to 
Booth chairs in the fall of 2013 
discussing possible locations 
for the relocated Spring Carni-
val Midway.”
Koenig also spoke about 
the changes that organizations 
faced as far as building booths. 
“Some of the biggest challeng-
es were simply due to space 
constraints on the smaller CFA 
parking lot. Ensuring that or-
ganizations were able to safely 
reach all sides of their booth 
during constructions was a sig-
ni?cant challenge.” Koenig also 
commented on how SCC plans 
to address these challenges 
more carefully in the future 
when deciding the layout of 
the booths to comply with “an

While many Carnegie 
Mellon students, faculty, 
and Pittsburgh community 
members were enjoying 
this year’s Carnival, Proj-
ect Olympus’ 20th Show 
and Tell captivated those in 
McConomy Auditorium on 
Thursday. Project Olympus 
is an annual event where 
students and faculty mem-
bers from Carnegie Mellon 
present their startups and 
innovations to a wider en-
trepreneurial community. 
Opening the event was Pro-
vost Farnam Jahanian, who 
described Project Olympus 
as “a window into ambi-
tious research and innova-
tions across campus.” He 
explained the project’s goal 
as being an opportunity for 
students to immerse them-
selves in this environment so 
that when they leave Carne-
gie Mellon they will have ex-
perienced how to think with 
an entrepreneurial mindset 
and will be well equipped to 
deal with similar problems 
in the real world.
Presentations started 
with two Carnegie Mellon 
faculty members whose 
research is focused on the 
capabilities of the brain, 
whether it be human or 
mechanical. Alison Barth, 
professor of biological sci-
ences at Carnegie Mellon, 
discussed her research on 
how neural circuits are 
wired. She relayed that a 
pressing dilemma for many 
neuroscientists is ?guring 
out what the circuits in the 
brain are doing and how 
connections occur between 
them for learning to happen. 
She compared the brain to a 
bowl of spaghetti, and in-
vited the audience to picture 
that bowl of spaghetti being 
cut in half. With this image 
in mind, it’s dif?cult to ?gure 
out what aligns with what. 
Barth presented slides to the 
audience that showed each 
of the brain’s synapses being 
assigned by type, and how 
this can allow us to identify 
how different connections 
respond. She hopes that her 
research will lead to ?nding 
a comprehensive, unbiased 
way to look at the brain’s 
synapses to determine how 
its circuits are changing.
Mike Vande Weghe, lead 
robotics engineer at the 
Robotics Institute, shifted 
the audience’s attention 
from the human brain to 
the possibilities of arti?cial 
intelligence. Weghe’s robot 
CHIMP de?nitely stole the 
show at this year’s show 
and tell. CHIMP was built 
for the 2012 Darpa Robotics 
Challenge. Weghe explained 
that his team wanted to cre-
ate a robot that could roll 
in addition to walking, and 
could transition from being 
on all four’s to using its two 
legs, thus providing more 
mobility. Weghe presented 
a video from the competi-
tion showing CHIMP los-
ing its balance, which was 
fated for all robots in the 
competition. He proudly 
expressed that while all the 
other robots needed human 
assistance to get back up 
that CHIMP managed to get 
up on its own. CHIMP man-
aged to come in third place 
in the competition, which, 
although not ?rst, still 
made Weghe happy with 
its performance. With this

NAPIER —  A New Zealand 
octopus named Inky escaped 
from the National Aquarium 
of New Zealand during the 
night. Inky, about the size of a 
soccer ball, apparently slipped 
through a small gap at the top 
of his tank, and octopus tracks 
indicate that he then traveled 
eight feet across the ?oor, into 
a 164-foot-long drainpipe that 
led him to the sea. Employees 
searched the aquarium’s pipes

This week it was 
announced that Earl Lewis, 
president of the Andrew W. 
Mellon Foundation, will be 
the keynote speaker at this 
year’s Commencement on 
Sunday, May 15 in Gesling 
Stadium.
Lewis was a former 
provost and executive vice 
president for Academic Af-
fairs and the Asa Griggs Can-
dler Professor of History and 
African-American Studies at 
Emory University. He previ-
ously held faculty appoint-
ments at the University of 
California, Berkeley and the 
University of Michigan. He 
is also the author and co-au-
thor of several books includ-
ing The African American 
Urban Experience: Perspec-
tives from the Colonial Pe-
riod to the Present, Defending 
Diversity: Af?rmative Action 
at the University of Michigan, 
the award-winning To Make 
Our World Anew: A History of 
African Americans, and the 
heralded book series Ameri-
can Crossroads.
“Dr. Lewis’ dedication to 
diversity, the humanities, 
the arts, and the use of digi-
tal learning tools to improve 
education resonates deeply 
with our core values here at 
Carnegie Mellon University,” 
said President Subra Suresh 
in an email to the Carnegie 
Mellon community. “We are 
honored and very fortunate 
to have Dr. Lewis as our key-
note speaker.”
Lewis will also be 
receiving an honorary 
Doctor of Humane Let-
ters degree at Sunday’s 
ceremony.

CMU alumnus explores the Ivy Leagues
Sean-Michael Green, a 
Carnegie Mellon alum from 
the Heinz College Master 
of Public Management Pro-
gram from 2005 –2006, has 
recently been in Pittsburgh 
promoting his new book The 
Things I Learned in College. 
The book focuses on Green’s 
year long journey exploring 
the eight Ivy League schools. 
He spent approximately 30 
days at each school talking 
to students and attending 
classes.
The book is not a guide for 
all of the nation’s Ivy League 
colleges, but rather offers a 
different view of each uni-
versity, hopefully bringing 
back fond memories for old 
alumni. Green brings his past 
experience as a stand-up co-
median to add to the humor 
of the novel. Kirkus Reviews 
describes his writing style as 
being “highly engaging and 
entertaining, with dry wit in-
fusing this book.”
Green notes his initial ad-
ventures in Pittsburgh and 
his upward trek through 
his own college days as 
being motivated by a past 
relationship. While attending 
a local community college 
he found his work often be-
ing scrutinized by his previ-
ous girlfriend who attended 
the University of Pittsburgh. 
“I was surprised by my good 
grades at the community col-
lege, and I showed my early 
grades to my girlfriend at the 
time. She was unimpressed, 
saying, ‘Well, yeah, you can 
do that at a community col-
lege, but try that at Pitt!’” He 
went on to get an education at 
the University of Pittsburgh, 
the University of Pennsyl-
vania, and Carnegie Mellon 
University, no doubt fond of 
the Pennsylvania area and 
higher education, as shown 
in his new book.
Green’s explorations of 
eight of the nation’s most 
prestigious colleges can be 
read in The Things I Learned 
in College now available in 
paperback and as an e-book 
through Amazon.

invention, Weghe stated that 
he wants people to know that 
“robots are at the point where 
we can do useful things with 
them.”
Following Barth and We-
ghe were six students, who 
each gave three minute 
presentations on their own 
startups and innovations. 
The diversity of the students, 
from all the different colleges, 
speaks to the potential for 
innovation across any ?eld. 
Eleanor Haglund, a creative 
writing major, and Nesra Yan-
nier, who holds an M.A. de-
gree in Learning, Design, and 
Technology from Stanford 
University, presented two of 
the most interactive innova-
tions. Haglund discussed e. 
e. books, an enhanced e-book 
software that differs from 
regular e-books because of 
its implementation of media. 
Haglund explains that e. e. 
books were created as a so-
lution to help the low supply 
of enhanced e-books, which 
is due to their creation being 
time consuming and them 
not being able to reach a wide 
audience. “We’re taking the 
next step in the creation of 
enhanced e-books,” Haglund 
said. Yannier talked about 
NoRILLA, a mixed-reality 
educational system that seeks 
to “promote discussion and 
turn [children] into little sci-
entists” and thus preparing 
them for a better future. It 
has been proven to increase 
children’s learning by ?ve 
times. In a video shown to the 
audience, one child using No-
RILLA exclaims “it was fun, I 
don’t want to stop playing it.”
Torrell Jackson, who is 
pursuing a dual Masters de-
gree in both Business Ad-
ministration and Health Care 
Policy & Management, spoke 
about Chiroproktor, a new 
technology that will allow its 
users to better understand the 
human body. It is a lifelike tool 
that allows users to practice 
spine repair, as one example, 
at their own convenience on 
their laptops or smart phones. 
Also focusing on the human 
body was Andy Chan, who 
started VIT, a company that 
allows its users to focus on 
certain behaviors that cause 
health problems and to identi-
fy the issue before it can incite 
serious health problems. VIT 
does this by measuring one’s 
fatigue index. “The more tired 
you are, the more your body 
can’t withstand stress,” Chan 
said. Chan hopes that VIT can 
help companies save time and 
money spent on worker inju-
ries by preventing these inju-
ries from even occurring.
James Laney talked about 
Aero Laboratories which uses 
automated data acquisition to 
increase the quality of inspec-
tion of utility companies. Ac-
cording to Laney, Aero Labo-
ratories aims to take manned 
operations and turn them 
into unmanned systems. Aero 
Laboratories is able to take an 
image and “detect and classify 
any potential hazard,” Laney 
said.
The last student presen-
tation was given by Xunjie 
Zhang, a ?rst year masters 
student in the Robotics Insti-
tute. Zhnag presented Nim-
bus, motorized shoes that 
“will easily double your walk-
ing speed,” Zhang said. Zhang 
presented these wheeled 
shoes as being ideal for stu-
dents who are late to class. 
He compares the invention as 
being like walking on an air-
port runway but instead cre-
ating this feeling everywhere 
you go. This was exempli?ed 
with a video shown by Zhang 
which showed him speeding 
past other Carnegie Mellon 
students around campus.
Students discuss innovations at annual Project Olympus  
STARTUP, from A1
up. Presenting one unique 
perspective, Pintar began his 
lecture with a clip from Peter 
Pan, who repeatedly sings “I 
don’t want to grow up.” Pintar 
sought to debunk the notion 
that growing up is not fun. 
Being a ?fth year student and 
having experienced the turbu-
lent ride of college, Pintar has 
come to the conclusion that 
college is the perfect time to 
grow up.
Similarly to Idowu, Pintar 
argued that we shouldn’t 
de?ne ourselves based on our 
major or career. Instead, we 
should ?nd something we are 
passionate about and strive to 
better ourselves in that area. 
He re?ects on his initial belief 
that he should aim to be at the 
top based on grades and skills. 
Now, however, he has learned 
that it is much more important 
to focus on learning. “The world 
doesn’t need people who are 
plastered to gold stars, getting 
As, and nice résumés,” Pintar 
said. “The world needs people 
who know what they’re doing, 
care about what they’re doing, 
and [are] doing something 
with what they know.”
One thing that Pintar is 
passionate about is teaching 
sign language. He currently 
teaches a StuCo Spring class 
that melds sign language 
and pop music together. As 
an example, he presented 
a video of himself during a 
previous Carnival signing to 
the song “Back Home” by Andy 
Grammer. The video was re-
ceived with applause and smil-
ing faces from the audience. 
For the audience, the video 
made clear the joy and happi-
ness that Pintar got from teach-
ing sign language in a way that 
was fun and interesting for 
students.
Pintar also focused his 
lecture on the difference be-
tween interdependence and 
self-suf?ciency, advocating for 
the former. He believes that 
we should focus on improving 
our relationships with others. 
He uses the analogy of a young 
child being dependent on his 
parents and those around him. 
He claims that as we grow older 
we tend to depend on others 
less. Pintar questions our de-
pleting trust and faith in others 
and argues that we should seek 
to reclaim this. He cites his faith 
as one of the factors helping 
him to put his trust in another 
being and helping him realize 
that his life is not his own.
Pintar concluded his lecture 
with three key fears that many 
of us face. These fears are com-
mitment, uselessness, and 
trust. To combat these he sug-
gests overcoming our isolation, 
taking the time to stop and re-
?ect on our purpose in life, and 
to regain our faith in society.
“I hope to see you when you 
graduate this place, as I am 
doing in a few short weeks, as 
someone who is joyful, giving, 
and interdependent,” Pintar 
said. “Don’t be scared of grow-
ing up. A joyful, satisfying life 
is waiting for you. Grow up and 
I promise you, you’ll never go 
back to what you left behind.”

LECTURES, from A1
Spring Carnival Committee gauges reactions to changes
acceptable standard of safety.” 
While maintaining safety for 
the booths was dif?cult, the 
layout and delivery of the rides 
also proved to be a problem. 
“[SCC] had to repeatedly re-
solve issues that arose the week 
prior to Carnival regarding the 
layout [of the rides] and access 
to the CFA parking lot and lawn 
for deliveries. These were is-
sues that [SCC] and other uni-
versity departments overlooked 
while planning for the reloca-
tion this year.”
When asked if he thought 
the change was as drastic as 
people were expecting, Koe-
nig responded “There was a 
signi?cant concern about the 
impact of Midway on the CFA 
building and the activities in 
the [CFA building]. However, it 
appears that the inconvenience 
placed on CFA students and 
faculty by Spring Carnival was 
much less than either side had 
anticipated.”
He felt that the transition 
of Carnival was heavily facili-
tated by “the incredible coop-
eration with [SCC] by both 
university administration and 
booth-building organizations.” 
He talked about the work SCC 
did all year long with several 
departments to prepare for 
any concerns that arose during 
the transition. He also com-
mended booth-building orga-
nizations for being “extremely 
patient and understanding as 
they dealt with the new space 
constraints and adapted their 
booth-building process in the 
new location.”
While this year was 
de?nitely a learning process for 
SCC and booth-building orga-
nizations alike, Koenig seemed 
hopeful that the lessons learned 
this year will allow for Carnival 
to be a much smoother process 
moving forward. “Hopefully, 
with the knowledge gained 
from this year, these challenges 
will become non-issues in 
future years.”

Vaasavi Unnava: give students chance to be exceptional
VAASAVI UNNAVA
Special to the Tartan
The experience of being 
elected Student Body Presi-
dent has been surreal and ex-
citing. Now it’s time to make 
the change we promised 
during elections.
The platform that Aaron 
and I put together stemmed 
from a question I heard my 
sophomore year: ”Why don’t 
Carnegie Mellon students be-
come leaders?” It was an in-
teresting question because the 
facts back it up — while our 
students have the highest sala-
ries upon graduating univer-
sity (higher than Harvard and 
Stanford, at the very least), 
after 10 to 20 years we ?nd 
ourselves working with lower 
salaries than our Ivy League 
counterparts. They’re leading 
the companies where we may 
work middle management. In 
our entire history, only one 
alumnus has joined the United 
States Congress (we have over 
100,000 alumni). 
What’s the deal? Why is 
this happening?
I don’t know if I have a 
clear, solid answer. But what I 
do know is that the most suc-
cessful, interesting students 
here they are the ones who 
have chosen to own and con-
trol the way they change the 
world rather than perpetuate 
the stress culture or stigma 
around struggles of mental 
health.
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent Aaron Gutierez and I 
created the President’s Initia-
tive to build an infrastructure 
where this sort of attitude was 
normal instead of exceptional. 
By moving the Board of Direc-
tors (a meeting of student or-
ganization executives) to the 
beginning of the year, we can 
set a yearly agenda for social 
change that all of us can take 
ownership of, from Sexual 
Assault and Relationship Vio-
lence Prevention, to mental 
health awareness, to academic 
integrity.
The magnitude of the ways 
that we can make change 
through this is awesome. 
Scotch’n’Soda could team up 
with Mobilization Of Resolute 
Feminists (MORF) to do an in-
teractive play on sexual assault 
and restrictive gender roles in 
society. Inter A Cappella Coun-
cil (IAC) could team up all the 
a cappella groups to show how 
music plays into race relations. 
Robotics Club could work with 
area high school students to 
increase the number of ap-
plications coming to Carnegie 
Mellon from underprivileged 
areas.
These are just my own 
ideas, so they’re not even the 
best ones. There is so much 
possibility for change — real, 
intentional change — and Aar-
on and I can’t wait to help that 
happen.
Just as much as leader-
ship is about doing innovative 
things in the spaces we occu-
py, it’s about us having the in-
formation to ask real questions 
about our campus community. 
That’s why Aaron and I want 
to give students the informa-
tion to actively question the 
world around them. So we’re 
pushing for transparency, both 
from Student Government and 
from the University’s ?nances.
Our current budgetary 
allocations process can be 
more transparent. There are 
so many questions that ?oat 
around our budgetary pro-
cess: How are we investing the 
endowment? Where does the 
money from our donations go? 
How do we decide how much 
money each school gets?
Students pay to attend 
Carnegie Mellon, but the sim-
ple frustration we express at 
not really knowing how any-
thing works is easily solvable. 
There should be a regular state 
of the ?nances, where we ex-
plain how the endowment 
works, how the budgetary 
process occurs, and some ba-
sic rules for determining bud-
gets. The question we should 
be asking is not “Why is our 
tuition so high?” but rather 
“What spending do we really 
need?”
We need to be actively in-
volved in the conversation. 
That’s even more true for 
Student Government. When 
a prevalent issue affects the 
campus community, it should 
be easy to access one’s student 
government representatives 
to make change. Students 
shouldn’t be left in the dark 
about what their student gov-
ernment of?cials are doing for 
them. That’s what we’re here 
for.
Aaron and I will continue 
to work with The Tartan to 
make our voice and our agen-
da as public as possible. How-
ever, we know the necessity 
of Facebook in the university 
media infrastructure — we 
plan on making a “To StuGov 
with Love” Facebook group, 
where students can talk about 
the pressing issues that need 
?xing on our campus. More 
than that, we want to be physi-
cally present for you, holding 
our constitutionally mandated 
of?ce hours in the most pub-
lic parts of campus. There 
shouldn’t be a boundary of ac-
cess to make campus better.
We are so excited to be 
elected your Student Body 
President and Vice President. 
To be voted into of?ce dur-
ing such an emotional time at 
Carnegie Mellon was a truly 
humbling experience. But to 
get all of this done, we need 
some help from you.
Without your help, care, 
and engagement, our platform 
is empty. It is built on the exist-
ing skills and infrastructures of 
our campus today and, while 
it’s hard, I believe we have the 
capacity to make it a reality.
As said in the Bee Movie (a 
?lm I’ve seen dozens of times), 
“According to all known laws 
of aviation, there’s no way a 
bee should be able to ?y. Its 
wings are too small to lift its 
fat little body off the ground. 
The bee, of course, ?ies any-
way — because bees don’t 
care what humans think is 
impossible.”
We have the capacity to as-
tound. I am now lucky enough 
to sit in a position to witness 
greatness as it happens. So, 
I say honestly and truly, my 
heart is in this work. I cannot 
wait for this coming year.
NINA FAN
Special to the Tartan
Thank you to each and 
every one of you at Carnegie 
Mellon University that partici-
pated in this year’s elections. 
My name is Nina Fan and 
words cannot express how ec-
static I am to of?cially be your 
new Student Body Vice Presi-
dent for Organizations. This 
is unreal. It is a huge honor 
to represent more than 300 
organizations and the 13,000 
students on campus and I 
cannot wait.
To begin with, I would like 
to give an immense thank you 
to everyone that I have worked 
with in Student Government 
for the past two years. It is the 
con?dence you all have in me 
and our mutual passion for 
effecting change on this cam-
pus that has driven me to run 
for this position. In addition 
to that, I would like to give 
an enormous shout-out to 
all the student organizations 
that I have worked with. I am 
constantly in awe at the mag-
ni?cent things you all achieve 
and working with you all has 
always been, and will contin-
ue to be, a pleasure. Lastly, I 
want to thank all of those who 
have supported me in any way 
during this elections season. I 
could not have done this with-
out any of you and I am so, so 
blessed to have you all.
My term does not of?cially 
begin until commencement 
on May 15 and any meetings 
will not be held until early 
September, but since I have 
been so excited since elec-
tions results came out, I have 
already hit the ground run-
ning. One of my initiatives is 
to increase communication 
and support for organizations 
and something that I have 
been doing is holding Q & A 
sessions for students who are 
interested in starting a new 
organization on campus. 
From my experience with 
new organizations, it is never 
too early to start planning the 
logistics of your organization 
and it is always really helpful 
to have someone who under-
stands the various parts of the 
new organization process to 
consult with. Many students 
who are interested in start-
ing new organizations tend to 
apply during mid to late Au-
gust, when the application for 
new organization recognition 
opens. Because the new rec-
ognition process is very pro-
cedural, I wanted to give 
students ample information 
before they apply for Student 
Government recognition for 
their respective organizations 
and understand that I will al-
ways be available anytime for 
any questions or concerns. 
Working with new organiza-
tions this past year has been 
one of my highlights during 
my time as a director on the 
Committee on Student Or-
ganizations and I absolutely 
cannot wait until August to 
see all the exciting new ideas!
I may have said thank you 
too many times during the 
past week, but, nevertheless, 
I want to say thank you all so 
much again for choosing me 
to lead you. It has been a few 
days and I am still on cloud 
nine. To all the other elected 
candidates and to everyone 
involved in student organi-
zations at Carnegie Mellon, 
I look forward to working 
closely with you all and I 
cannot wait for the amazing 
changes we will make togeth-
er to this school next year.  
Cheers to a great year 
ahead!
Nina Fan: Experience with and passion for orgs is keyNeal Choudhary: JFC policy changes will make budget allocations process easier
NEAL CHOUDHARY
Special to the Tartan
I am honored to be elected 
Student Body Vice President 
for Finance (SBVPF) and to 
serve you in the upcoming 
year. Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, with all its wonders and 
horrors, is home to all of us. 
I believe it is the duty of each 
and every one of us to make it 
a better community.
I am humbled to be in a 
crucial position to uphold this 
duty. Thank you for the con?-
dence and trust you place in 
me. The responsibilities of the 
SBVPF are numerous. I aim to 
do my utmost to uphold these 
to the highest standard.
My goals as SBVPF are 
simple: I want to improve the 
Budget Allocation process by 
increasing awareness about 
the Joint Funding Commit-
tee (JFC) through initiatives 
such as JFC Awareness Day 
and more, to ensure that JFC’s 
membership is representa-
tive of the diverse multitude 
of organizations we have on 
campus; to implement more 
consistency in the allocations 
provided to organizations; 
to improve communication 
to organizations; and to in-
crease transparency about the 
budget allocation process to 
collaborate with the Student 
Body President, Student Sen-
ate, and other members of 
Student Government in their 
initiatives to improve the 
Carnegie Mellon community.
While ambitious, these 
goals are attainable and it will 
be my top priority to make 
them a reality.
It is my belief that being in 
the Student Government Ex-
ecutive Branch is akin to hav-
ing a conversation with the 
student body and working to 
provide them what they want. 
As such, I would love to hear 
your ideas and plans about 
what we can do better next 
year. If you have any feedback 
or observations or criticisms, 
please share them with me.
I am very prideful about 
being a Tartan. I am thrilled 
to be a part of the Carnegie 
Mellon Community every 
day. As such, words cannot 
describe how excited I am 
to enter this role next year. I 
want to thank you all for your 
participation within the com-
munity. I look forward to us 
working together next year.

Donald Trump’s trip to PGH marked by fear, excitement
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
Con?rmed physical object 
and presidential candidate 
Donald Trump held two Pitts-
burgh events last Wednesday: 
a taped town hall at Soldiers 
and Sailors Memorial Hall 
and Museum and a rally at 
the David L. Lawrence Con-
vention Center.
The unease around both 
the University of Pittsburgh 
and Carnegie Mellon cam-
puses prior to both events was 
palpable. There was a protest 
that took the form of a sit-in 
on the lawn at Soldiers and 
Sailors. It was advertised as 
peaceful and attendees were 
encouraged to not harm or 
interact with Trump support-
ers. A counter-protest had a 
decidedly less peaceful tone, 
as people were encouraged 
to open carry weapons such 
as AR- and AK-style semi-
automatic weapons to “pre-
vent roadblocks.” This scared 
quite a few people away from 
attending the earlier Trump 
event.
The rally downtown also 
had a designated protest area 
that was ?lled with mostly 
college students, but inside 
the actual event were thou-
sands of Trump supporters.
Doors opened hours before 
the event, leaving us to survey 
the convention center ?oor. 
Supporters were donned in 
everything from suits and ties 
to shirts that read “Hillary 
sucks but not like Monica,” a 
reference to former Secretary 
of State Hillary Clinton and 
anti-bullying advocate Moni-
ca Lewinsky. The shirts were 
being sold outside with other 
in?ammatory gear including 
a sign that said “?nally some-
one with balls” alongside the 
regular “make America great 
again” hats associated with 
the campaign.
The Trump campaign’s 
choice of pre-show music 
ranged from the epic (Gia-
como Puccini’s “Nessun Dor-
ma”) to the frightening (Elton 
John’s “Funeral For a Friend/
Love Lies Bleeding”) and the 
fade-out of every song was 
met with chants of “USA!” or 
“Build that wall!” until, after 
what felt like an eternity of 
waiting, an opener came on 
for Trump. He focused on vet-
erans issues and running the 
country like a business to a lot 
of indifference and occasional 
fanfare when he said he didn’t 
like Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX).
After the opening speaker 
and a few minutes of antici-
pation, a voice came over the 
loudspeakers informing us 
that Trump loved the First 
Amendment as much as he 
loved the Second Amend-
ment. That seemed to be 
a bizarre way to describe 
how Trump feels about free 
speech, but the voice clari-
?ed. They revealed that the 
designated protest area was 
provided by Trump himself 
and that he was not required 
to allow protesters into a pri-
vate event. Attendees who 
witnessed a protester were 
encouraged not to touch or 
harm the protester (an image 
the Trump campaign is trying 
to shake) but instead to “raise 
[their] signs over [their] 
heads and chant ‘Trump! 
Trump! Trump!’ until the 
protester is escorted from the 
venue by security.” The scene 
felt like something out of The 
Giver and really would not 
help with people who came 
in feeling Trump was a fascist 
with dangerously loyal and 
mindless supporters.
Trump then came on stage 
to 2 Unlimited’s “Get Ready 
for This,” adding to the cel-
ebratory atmosphere.
The Republican frontrun-
ner did not get off to a great 
start. He spoke about his con-
nection to Philadelphia before 
saying he was going to bring 
back embattled and also dead 
Penn State football coach Joe 
Paterno before remember-
ing he was in Pittsburgh and 
scrambling to say something 
about Steelers quarterback 
Ben Roethlisberger.
Trump recovered quickly 
however, railing on his mes-
sage about how free trade 
deals — the North Ameri-
can Free Trade Agreement in 
particular — have destroyed 
Western Pennsylvania to 
raucous applause. He went 
through his usual shtick about 
Lyin’ Ted, the national debt 
that requires a businessman, 
and the dishonest media fo-
cusing on the failed deals he 
made 18 years ago and not his 
successes.
Trump then went on a bi-
zarre tangent claiming that 
North Korea’s Kim Jong-un 
must be smart to have taken 
over North Korea at such a 
young age despite the ruth-
less generals that could have 
conspired to stop him. It’s 
unclear if Trump under-
stands how cults of person-
ality or the North Korean 
government work. To be fair 
to Trump, he was not say-
ing Kim is a good leader, just 
that he must be smart to have 
been given North Korea as his 
inheritance.
After the rally and be-
fore we left, I caught up with 
a few Trump supporters to 
ask about their feelings on 
Trump and the rally. Local 
high school student and fake 
name creator extraordinaire 
Dawson Creek told me that he 
felt it was important to have 
someone who knows money 
pay off the national debt. Oth-
er local Trump supporters, 
like Lynn Tambellini and Amy 
Williams, echoed this senti-
ment. They added on that it 
resonated with them when 
Trump talked about building 
the military back up.
Both also claimed their 
favorite part of the rally was 
when Trump said “Ted Cruz 
holds up the Bible and then he 
lies,” indicating appreciation 
for the occasionally negative 
tone of Trump’s campaign.
As I left the arena, police 
in riot gear on Fort Duquesne 
Boulevard were separat-
ing Trump supporters and 
protesters. I passed a clash 
between a protester in a car 
holding a “F–k Trump” sign 
and a supporter yelling “Oh 
I know, they must be on wel-
fare!” to which the protester 
replied, “No, you’re just 
f–king stupid.”
It was about par for the 
course in the aftermath of the 
rally.
Trump is the latest in a 
string of candidates to hold 
events in Western Pennsylva-
nia as the Pennsylvania pri-
mary approaches on April 26.

* Denotes executive committee 
member
The phrase “zero tolerance for 
sexual assault” has been heard 
around campus a lot recently, includ-
ing on these very pages last Monday. 
A change.org petition directed at 
University President Subra Suresh 
titled “Zero Tolerance for Sexual As-
sault at Carnegie Mellon University” 
has gained over 970 signatures in 
the past two weeks. The petition has 
made one thing clear: the student 
body and the administration are not 
on the same page about sexual as-
sault prevention and punishment. 
The petition’s demands have clearly 
struck a nerve on our campus de-
spite representing a signi?cant de-
parture from the university admin-
istration’s current way of dealing 
with sexual assault. It is time for the 
administration and student body 
to have a candid discussion about 
Carnegie Mellon’s sexual assault 
policy. While it is high time that we 
clearly de?ned policies about sexual 
assault, as a campus community we 
should be cognizant of the dangers 
of one-size-?ts-all policies.
The petition calls for three key 
policy reforms. The main policy 
point is that “any student found re-
sponsible for sexual assault by CMU’s 
University Disciplinary Committee 
will face immediate expulsion.” The 
petition also asks the administra-
tion to publish “the number of sex-
ual assault cases which reach a 
resolution through the 
University Disciplin-
ary Committee, 
the number of 
students found 
responsible for 
sexual assault 
through the 
University 
Disciplinary 
Committee, the 
number of students expelled 
for sexual assault through 
the University Disciplinary 
Committee,” each year, and 
?nally that these changes 
be made clear to the student body 
“through an all student e-mail, as 
well as an addition to CMU’s The 
Word, both online and in print,” 
and incorporated into orientation 
week lectures.
In order to understand the effect 
of the changes that are being asked 
for and the way they would alter 
our campus culture around sexual 
assault we have to ?rst understand 
the status quo. Currently, the Of?ce 
of Title IX Initiatives (TIX) has an 
individual-centric view of sexual as-
sault policy. 
According to their website, 
the of?ce’s response to sexual as-
sault “is largely driven by the 
wishes and preferences of the 
person affected by the sexual 
misconduct”(emphasis in origi-
nal). When a case of sexual assault 
is reported, the of?ce’s ?rst step is to 
provide support resources and im-
plement safety measures for the sur-
vivor. These safety measures most 
often take the form of a no contact 
agreement between the reporter and 
the accused assailant.
Next, TIX gives the reporting par-
ty the option to initiate a university 
investigation into the accusations. 
If the reporting party decides to go 
through with the process, the case 
it is investigated by the University 
Police and TIX, and then given over 
to the University Disciplinary Com-
mittee. This committee is made up 
of two student board members, one 
staff/administrator board mem-
ber, one faculty board member, and 
one additional faculty or staff/ad-
ministrator board member, and is 
moderated by the Associate Dean of 
Student Affairs. These members are 
charged with holding a hearing to 
review the evidence and determin-
ing if an assault took place and what 
punishments should be applied to 
the perpetrator. 
The university uses a more re-
laxed standard of preponderance of 
evidence, meaning that there is over 
a 50 percent chance an assault oc-
curred, to determine guilt instead of 
the more rigorous criminal standard 
of beyond a reasonable doubt. Once 
the committee has made a decision 
about the assault charge they deliver 
their recommendation to the Dean 
of Student Affairs, who makes the 
?nal decision about guilt and any 
potential punishment.
Currently, there are no regulations 
controlling how people 
are punished for commit-
ting sexual assault. 
Generic possible pun-
ishments, referred 
to as sanctions, for any violation of 
community standards are listed in 
Carnegie Mellon’s Community Stan-
dards, Policies, and Procedures, and 
include community service, ?nes, 
disciplinary probation, suspension, 
and expulsion. There is no list of 
sanctions speci?c to sexual assault, 
leaving the committee and the Dean 
of Student Affairs a lot of leeway in 
how they discipline assailants.
The administration’s de?nition 
of sexual assault also has surprising 
amounts of ambiguity. The univer-
sity has of?cially de?ned sexual as-
sault in two places in the University 
Policy Against Sexual Harassment 
and Sexual Assault. Troublingly, 
these two de?nitions seem to con-
?ict. Section I lists speci?c acts that 
are considered sexual assault, in-
cluding rape and dating violence, 
implying a more narrow de?nition. 
Meanwhile, the Appendix E de?ni-
tion says sexual assault is “engaging 
in any physical sexual act perpetrat-
ed against a person’s will, where that 
person does not give clear, volun-
tary consent, or where that person 
is incapable of giving consent due to 
drug or alcohol use, or due to intel-
lectual disability.” TIX clari?ed that 
the vague Appendix E de?nition is 
the correct one, and con?rmed in an 
email that “actions such as non-con-
sensual fondling, touching, groping, 
or kissing are ‘physical sexual acts 
perpetrated against a person’s will’ 
and therefore fall under [the] de?ni-
tion of assault.”
This is where the “Zero Tolerance 
for Sexual Assault at Carnegie Mel-
lon University” petition runs into its 
?rst logistical dif?culty. The writers 
of the petition noticed these dis-
crepancies and speci?ed that their 
demand for automatic expulsion is 
based on the broader Appendix E 
de?nition. This leaves no room for 
proportional punishment based on 
the crime, and treats someone who 
kisses someone without asking ?rst 
the same as a rapist.
There is more at stake in this peti-
tion than a quibble over de?nitions. 
The petition demands a shift away 
from the individual-centric policies 
of TIX and towards a community-
centric plan. Right now the system 
has the ?exibility to accommodate 
survivors’ wishes. As a community 
it would be more comfortable to 
remove perpetrators of sexual as-
sault from our environment, but that 
comfort comes at a price. A frequent 
concern with zero tolerance policies 
is that they have a chilling effect on 
reporting. A Carnegie Mellon Sexual 
Assault and Relationship Violence 
Study done in the 
spring of 2015 
found that less 
than 5 percent 
of assaults are 
reported to 
the admin-
istration 
for review, 
and that 
“between 20 and 41 percent of stu-
dents didn’t report because they 
believed they might be partially at 
fault or might be mistaken that they 
were assaulted.” The idea 
of opening an investiga-
tion that could get someone 
expelled when you are not 
even sure what happened 
is extremely intimidating, 
and sets up another road block to in-
creasing our abysmally low number 
of reports. Some survivors simply 
want the of?cial con?rmation that 
what happened was assault while 
others want their attackers expelled, 
or some other solution on the spec-
trum in between. People whose ?nal 
goal is not their assailant’s expulsion 
end up not being able to report at all.
There is an argument to be made 
that campus safety is at risk if we do 
not remove rapists from the com-
munity. One survey found that 63 
percent of college men who admit 
to committing rape say they did it 
repeatedly, an average of 5.8 times. 
The looming threat of expulsion 
could be a deterrent to would-be 
rapists. What this discussion comes 
down to is a question about the pur-
pose of university investigations into 
charges of sexual assault. Should our 
system exist to facilitate survivors’ 
recovery, or should it be a tool for 
justice and a way to shape our com-
munity? Instituting a zero tolerance 
policy would steer us towards the 
latter.
If our campus decides to do the 
former and focus on individual 
survivors, there are still a lot of re-
form options we should consider.

Campus needs nuanced assault prevention frameworkSpring Carnival Booths are be-
coming more elaborate, and more 
expensive, from one year to the 
next. The situation is akin to an 
arms race: no organization can scale 
back, lest its public image (read: 
recruitment) suffer and current 
members and alumni object force-
fully. However, building a booth is 
consuming more time, money, and 
person-power year after year. This 
trend is unsustainable.
In my opinion, Booth is a colos-
sal waste of organizations’ money 
and resources. Many groups have 
a substantial, even obscene, budget 
for new materials that end up in a 
dumpster on Sunday afternoon. 
Worse still are booths left incom-
plete. All is demolished after less 
than three days on display, and that 
is simply wasteful. At the very least, 
a budget limit should be imposed 
not only to level the playing ?eld for 
organizations with smaller budgets, 
but also to emphasize the univer-
sity community’s commitment to 
making things that matter, making 
things that last.
Making things that last.
Let’s take this one step further: 
suppose that instead of drawing up 
plans for a glori?ed shed, talented 
students were to design a mural, 
playground, garden, or remodeling 
project and pitch it to nonpro?t or-
ganizations and community lead-
ers. Suppose that instead of provid-
ing extensive safety and security 
measures for a parking lot, the Uni-
versity were to provide transporta-
tion to project sites for groups to im-
plement their plans. Suppose that 
booth resulted in something that 
would make a difference, some-
thing that would last (other than, of 
course, the coveted trophies award-
ed to organizations for projects that 
will be summarily demolished).
I spent two “build weeks” too 
many in the Morewood parking 
lot: the ?rst fueled by starry-eyed 
curiosity, the second fueled by 
peer pressure and threat of ?nes. 
I saw Booth make some individu-
als unhappy, disagreeable, resent-
ful, depressed, and physically ill or 
injured. I am displeased that our 
university continues to sanction 
a tradition which so explicitly en-
courages pouring money, time, and 
effort into things that don’t last. In-
stead, let’s ?nd meaningful outlets 
for students’ creative talents, sense 
of healthy competition, and count-
less hours of free time during build 
week.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: BOOTH

Carnival, and Buggy in particu-
lar, is a unique tradition here at 
Carnegie Mellon. This year, in addi-
tion to visiting the booths on mid-
way, attending the GRiZ concert, 
and enjoying time with alumni and 
friends, I had the privilege of push-
ing for SPIRIT’s Women’s A team. 
Buggy has been a huge highlight 
of my college experience. Between 
driving, pushing, and maintaining 
the buggy, the sport requires the 
perfect balance of skill, engineer-
ing, and athleticism. Inevitably, I al-
ways get a rush of excitement when 
a friend or family member asks me 
to explain Buggy to them.
Through these discussions, 
however, I’ve come to realize that 
though Buggy is not a “real sport,” 
it is no exception to the sexism that 
exists within traditional collegiate 
sports. A clear example of this sex-
ism can be seen in the comparison 
between the national buzz that 
March Madness receives every year 
and the half-?lled stands at wom-
en’s basketball games. Women’s 
athletic teams are almost always 
seen as inferior and less entertain-
ing than their male counterparts, 
and Buggy is no exception.
I believe the dismissal of women 
pushers stems from two main fac-
tors: timing and tone. Every year, 
the women’s buggy teams compete 
early in the morning (8 a.m. to 10 
a.m. during the preliminaries), 
while the men’s teams compete 
later (10 a.m. to noon). Historically, 
the men’s heats have had better at-
tendance. While the women’s teams 
may have a few dedicated fans and 
their teammates on the sidelines 
cheering them on, the sidelines are 
gradually ?lled as the day progress-
es and the men’s heats approach. 
This isn’t because the men’s races 
are particularly more interesting 
than the women’s, but simply be-
cause they are at a more convenient 
time.
Furthermore, there is a dramatic 
shift in the tone of the commen-
tary during the men’s heats, with 
the men’s races being described as 
more exciting. An example of this 
can be seen in commentary given 
during preliminary rolls this year. 
At the beginning of the men’s seg-
ment, after the alumni grudge 
race, one commentator said “We’re 
about to get into the real stuff here, 
women’s prelims were very clean 
[...] what do you guys expect to see 
out of the men’s races here?” His 
colleague responded, “Oh wow, a 
lot.” Now, it could be that by “real 
stuff” the commentator was refer-
ring to races with students rather 
than alumni, but I doubt this. As a 
woman pusher, I interpreted this 
exchange and the shift in tone 
to mean that the commentators 
thought the men’s heats were more 
exciting and more important.
Both men and women pushers 
put in the same amount of time 
and effort. We all show up to rolls 
early in the morning on the week-
ends. We all take time from doing 
our homework to attend midnight 
rolls. Most importantly, we all want 
to make our team proud. So I simply 
request equal glory for equal work.
To achieve this, I propose two 
solutions to the overlooked, sexist 
practices of Buggy. First, I propose 
that Sweepstakes alternate which 
gender pushes early in the morn-
ing. One year the women should 
push starting at 8 a.m. and the next 
year the men can take the early slot. 
Secondly, I propose that there is one 
female buggy commentator. There 
are 23 women’s push teams and 30 
men’s teams, not to mention female 
drivers and mechanics. Having a 
female commentator will help en-
sure that our value and hard work 
is fully appreciated and remarked 
on. There should be equal represen-
tation in the sport that we all love 
so much. In conclusion, I want to 
express my love and appreciation 
my teammates and SPIRIT’s alumni 
who have continued to encourage 
and support all pushers, whether 
male or female.

When the hit musical Hamilton 
debuted on Broadway last year, most 
people had nothing but praise for 
the rap retelling of the life of Alex-
ander Hamilton. Its songs — which 
combine rap, hip hop, and more 
traditional musical theatre styles — 
and its cast — made up of nonwhite 
actors who play historically white 
characters — were an instant success 
among audiences, musical theatre 
fans, and casual listeners alike. 
Recently, however, the show has 
been taking a hit from historians 
who claim that certain historical in-
accuracies detract from the racially 
positive message embodied in the 
clever lyrics and multiethnic cast. 
While these criticisms undoubtedly 
highlight the enduring ?aws in the 
entertainment industry, they fail 
to recognize the steps forward that 
Hamilton has taken.
The aforementioned historical 
inaccuracies seem, for the most part, 
to take two forms. First, a signi?cant 
number of the objections to the mu-
sical stem from the claim that it is 
part of what was called the “Found-
ers Chic” mentality by The Atlantic. 
Due in part to the increasing popu-
larity of the founding fathers of the 
country, including Hamilton, George 
Washington, Thomas Jefferson, and 
others depicted in the show, many 
of the ?aws of the actual historical 
?gures have been glossed over or 
altogether ignored.
In reality, Washington was aloof 
and often distant, a far cry from the 
fatherly ?gure of the musical. Far 
worse, Jefferson was an unapolo-
getic slaveholder. Hamilton himself 
was in favor of big banks and, at one 
point, a monarchal presidency. The 
historical ?gures themselves may 
have had revolutionary ideas for 
organizing a government, but their 
attitudes towards many issues were, 
if nothing else, very much the prod-
uct of their time.
More criticism stems from the fact 
that the African Americans essential 
to the country’s establishment were 
largely ignored in favor of focusing 
on the white heroes of the narrative. 
The New York Times identi?ed Cato, a 
slave who belonged to Hercules Mul-
ligan and who worked as a spy by his 
owner’s side, as one such ?gure who 
might have easily been included, yet 
he is not given a place alongside his 
fellow revolutionaries in the musical.
“Imagine Hamilton with white ac-
tors,” said Annette Gordon-Reed, a 
history and law professor at Harvard 
University, in an article for The Public 
Historian. “Would the rosy view of 
the founding era grate?”
Though it can’t be ignored that 
the roles of historical minorities go 
largely unexplored over the course 
of the show, they aren’t completely 
disregarded. Numerous lyrics refer-
ence both the abolitionist views held 
by Hamilton, as well as a battalion 
of slaves organized by John Laurens 
who fought in the Revolutionary 
War in exchange for their freedom.
While it’s true that the founding 
fathers get a free pass for many of the 
problematic aspects of their lives, 
the point of Hamilton was never to 
critique them. Rather, it aims to take 
their stories — stories about white 
men, which have been predominant-
ly claimed by subsequent genera-
tions of Caucasian Americans over 
the years — and give other ethnici-
ties a sense of ownership over them 
as well. 
Hamilton isn’t history — it’s ?c-
tion. And it’s far more focused on 
what it can do for the future than 
how it can re?ect the past.
“[Working on the show] is the 
only time I’ve ever felt particularly 
American,” said actor Daveed Diggs, 
who portrays Marquis de Lafayette 
and Thomas Jefferson, in an inter-
view with Charlie Rose. “I think ... 
it gives value to whoever you are; I 
think it does that for everybody.”
Hamilton can also be an eye-
opening experience for everyone, 
because it draws attention to a 
number of issues that are being 
increasingly discussed today. The 
speci?cally nonwhite cast, which re-
cently experienced pushback after a 
controversial casting call, only serves 
to highlight the number of roles from 
which minorities are still system-
atically excluded, both on Broadway 
and in the entertainment industry 
in general. And the emphasis placed 
on immigrants, and their enormous 
contributions to our nation, is equal-
ly timely considering the present-
day political atmosphere.
Just because Hamilton hasn’t 
?xed every problem in the enter-
tainment industry in one fell swoop 
doesn’t mean that more positive 
changes can’t build off of its success 
in the future. 
We can’t fault Hamilton for not 
pulling off an entire revolution when 
in truth, it is only the ?rst step of a 
process that will take far more effort 
and love to succeed. 
But as far as ?rst steps go, it is 
certainly a powerful — and catchy — 
one, and it has left Americans of all 
ethnicities and backgrounds excited 
for what comes next.
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Infrastructure policy has always 
been tucked into the most wonkish 
corners of politics. The physical hard-
ware necessary to sustain a country 
has always been important, but due 
to the relative ease of highway bills 
passing in recent history, it has never 
been a sexy political issue. How-
ever, two factors in recent months 
— Senator Bernie Sanders’ (I–
VT) call for a trillion dollar 
infrastructure spending plan 
and the kerfuf?e over the 
highway bill that ended in 
stalemate — have had the 
positive consequence of 
making the country 
care about infra-
structure policy 
once again. 
The prob-
lem is 
that 
these two events did not provide 
a very clear path forward. Despite 
the detail of his actual proposal, 
Sanders rarely publicly clari?es his 
infrastructure stances beyond his de-
sire to “rebuild our crumbling infra-
structure” and the highway ?ght … 
actually, don’t get me started on the 
highway ?ght. The problem is, the 
importance of detail in infrastructure 
policy makes these sort of moments 
the best we can hope for in terms of 
national discussion on infrastruc-
ture. Infrastructure policy puts poli-
cymakers in a dif?cult conundrum. 
Infrastructure constantly needs to 
be updated for safety and economic 
competitiveness, but retro?tting 
thousands of miles of train tracks, 
revamping millions of water towers, 
and ?lling billions of potholes is in-
credibly expensive and hard to gen-
erate political will for.
Luckily, an idea that 
has been sitting in 
Congress for 30 
years pro-
vides us 
with a path out of this dilemma.
That idea is none other than the 
National Infrastructure Bank. The 
name says it all: the bank would be 
federally administered and would ?-
nance infrastructure projects.
The National Infrastructure Bank 
would probably be an uphill political 
battle at ?rst. Even President Barack 
Obama tried for one in years past. 
However, if passed, it would help 
infrastructure spending become free 
from the consistent problems that 
have dogged it for decades.
First, the politics of infrastructure 
spending could be shifted to the mar-
ket, which has a much more urgent 
need for infrastructure than politi-
cians who are perpetually focused on 
reelection. Second, the bank would 
signi?cantly decrease the need for 
government investment in infrastruc-
ture by making it possible for private 
companies to undertake the massive 
necessary projects with federal back-
ing. This would decrease the public 
cost of infrastructure as well as de-
crease the costs associated with 
failing infrastructure, which 
were detailed in The 
Tartan last week.
Our current infrastructure poli-
tics once relied heavily on earmark-
ing for local infrastructure. Earmarks 
were basically banned in 2010 (this 
was probably ill-advised, but that’s 
another ?ght for another day), so it 
is no longer useful for infrastructure 
money. Even when infrastructure 
had the easy funding from earmarks, 
local spending was not great for 
large, national infrastructure like in-
terstates and railroads.
Since this was our default fund-
ing mechanism for so long, things 
that require national investment 
like freight lines never got adequate 
funding and are incredibly subpar. 
In addition, earmarking is also hard 
to evaluate and is subject to lots of 
under the table politics. This means 
most transportation projects in his-
tory have been corporate welfare 
for local construction com-
panies or bait to 
get national 
corporations to build factories 
in certain locations. Our current sys-
tem relies on politicians who need to 
justify trillion-dollar spending pro-
grams for an issue that often ends 
up on the periphery of the public 
consciousness.
By shifting infrastructure spend-
ing away from public arena, the 
National Infrastructure Bank would 
make economic need the priority for 
infrastructure spending. This would 
make spending more responsive to 
needs as vital infrastructure projects 
move to the front of the line.
The bank would also improve the 
conditions for private infrastructure 
investment by using the ?nancial 
muscle of the federal government 
to allow ?nancing for large projects. 
Generating private sector spending 
decreases the tax burden on citi-
zens to fund infrastructure projects. 
This frees up money for other pub-
lic projects without losing quality in 
investment. 
If companies were using the bank 
for ?nancing, it would limit the need 
for contracting, which can cause 
problems in spending projects when 
companies are paid a ?xed rate for 
the job, have it secured, and then cut 
corners when the government is try-
ing to keep its numbers down.
Infrastructure is a politi-
cal nightmare. It’s an ur-
gent need, but the 
price tags associated often get these 
programs pushed aside. We should 
create a National Infrastructure Bank 
to lay the groundwork for America’s 
infrastructure to support the nation’s 
economic needs for decades to come.

Actually, the second and third de-
mands in the petition, which asks for 
transparency about sexual assault 
accusation outcomes and for speci?c 
steps to be taken to educate the stu-
dent body about new sexual assault 
policies, offer a good place to start. 
Transparency about investigation 
proceedings and the disciplinary de-
cision making process is vital. The 
administration’s process has failed 
students in the past, resulting in an 
investigation by the U.S. Department 
of Education’s Of?ce of Civil Rights, 
and sometimes still continues to fail 
them. It’s not that the decision mak-
ers are bad people or intentionally 
causing harm. It’s just a simple ques-
tion of incentives. Investigations into 
incidents of sexual assault create bad 
PR for the administration, and expel-
ling people found guilty of sexual as-
sault exposes the school to lawsuits. 
The only way to break the cycle is to 
change the incentives by giving the 
student body the power to hold the 
administration accountable.
In order to hold the administra-
tion accountable, the student body 
needs two things: de?ned standards 
that the administration can be held 
to, and information on how those 
standards are applied. TIX should 
lay out clear descriptions of what 
sanctions can be used to punish 
transgressions of different severity 
so that survivors have a level of as-
surance about what the administra-
tion has to do for them. There should 
be several possible sanctions for 
each crime so that the situation can 
be tailored to the speci?c survivor 
within the general framework. Once 
this framework is in place statistics 
about investigation and hearing out-
comes should be publicly published 
as requested in the petition.
In addition to increasing trans-
parency, we could change the in-
centives by giving the job of hearing 
cases and making recommendations 
for sanctions to independent investi-
gators who are not tied to the admin-
istration. Several other schools that 
were part of the Department of Edu-
cation’s investigation, such as Am-
herst and Dartmouth, have already 
taken this step.
The third demand in the petition 
touches on the importance of in-
forming and educating people about 
campus sexual assault policies. In 
2012 the American Association of 
University Professors released a 
guide for developing adequate poli-
cies and procedures for dealing with 
sexual assault on college campuses. 
Four of the twelve points highlight 
the importance of publicizing poli-
cies and making them clear, read-
able, and easily accessible. The cur-
rent de?nition of sexual assault is 
inconsistent, unclear, and too broad 
to be practical. It is impossible to 
teach people how to prevent assault 
when you cannot clearly articulate 
what assault is. 
This is just one example of a 
larger systemic problem. While 
sexual assault awareness and edu-
cation is emphasized during orien-
tation, this quickly peters out. Most 
of the general student body does 
not know what TIX does, and even 
some trained student members of 
the Survivor Support Network don’t 
understand the University Disciplin-
ary Committee’s process. The Sexual 
Assault and Relationship Violence 
Study found that 6.25 percent of 
students did not report their assault 
to Carnegie Mellon because they 
did not know how, did not trust the 
process, or did not think they would 
be believed. If those people started 
reporting, the percent of reported 
cases would double.
A zero tolerance policy initially 
sounds appealing, with its clear-cut 
answers and easy black and white 
morality. Writing clearer guide-
lines, publishing outcome statistics, 
and using independent investiga-
tors are not as ?ashy or as satisfy-
ing to post about on Facebook, but 
they are the solutions we need to be 
talking about.

Sweepstakes, also known 
as Buggy, is the sport of 
pushing small people (usu-
ally women) down hills. What 
makes this a sport, and not 
just bullying, is the Buggy it-
self: the wheeled vehicle con-
taining the driver, propelled 
by the pushers.
The earliest Buggies were 
made of wood and had four 
wheels, and the drivers sat 
upright. Modern buggies have 
more technological tricks up 
their sleeves, however. Most 
are made of carbon ?ber 
and have three wheels, with 
the driver lying ?at on their 
stomach.
Carbon ?ber is the lightest 
and strongest material choice 
available, and it is used by 
most organizations. Some 
buggies currently in use do 
have partial metal frames, 
however. Metal adds weight, 
which isn’t necessarily a bad 
thing. Heavier buggies pick 
up more momentum, but at 
the same time, they’re harder 
for the pushers to bring up to 
speed.
“Most orgs are moving to-
ward lighter buggies, though,” 
said materials science senior, 
Patricia Xu. Xu was the head 
mechanic for the Carnegie In-
volvement Association’s (CIA) 
buggy team in the 2014–2015 
school year, and served as 
an adviser in the 2015-2016 
school year. Her expertise 
helped lead the CIA women’s 
team to back-to-back ?rst-
place wins last year and this 
year; she also helped lead the 
CIA men’s team to 3rd place 
?nishes both years. It’s safe to 
assume she knows what she’s 
talking about when it comes 
to building buggies.
Some organizations, in-
cluding CIA, build a new 
buggy every year. Old buggies 
are retired when CIA runs out 
of room to store them, and 
they’re most often relocated 
to live with the alumni who 
worked on building them.
When it comes to build-
ing a new buggy, the very 
?rst consideration is follow-
ing the rules, lest the buggy 
become unsafe, or the team 
get disquali?ed. Drivers need 
to have at least 45 degrees of 
visibility, and brakes need to 
be able to stop a buggy at a 
certain distance, depending 
on the speed. The buggy has 
to be built to hold together 
even at high speeds or when 
vibrating. Just using loctite 
adhesives isn’t enough, Xu ex-
plains: “Everything needs to 
have lock washers [and] lock-
nuts to make sure it stays.” 
Experimental two-wheel bug-
gies were used in past years, 
particularly in the 1980s, 
but were outlawed for safety 
concerns.
Now, every buggy but one 
has three wheels. These can 
be arranged either in a stan-
dard trike pattern, with one in 
the front and two in the back, 
or in a reverse trike pattern, 
with two in the front and one 
in the back.
As far as brakes go, there 
are two main choices: fric-
tion braking or drop brak-
ing. “A friction brake works 
like a bicycle brake,” Xu ex-
plained, “by pushing against 
the wheels or the rims to slow 
it down.” Drop brakes involve 
lowering a brake pad to the 
ground underneath the buggy 
and dragging it along to create 
friction and slow the buggy 
down.
Similarly, most organiza-
tions use one of two steering 
choices, wagon or Ackermann. 
Wagon steering is when two 
wheels are connected by an 
axle, and the driver rotates the 
entire axle to make the turn. 
This causes problems because 
the inside wheel is traveling a 
shorter distance than the out-
side wheel, even when they’re 
turned to the same angle. It 
also requires enough room 
around the wheel for it to 
move forward and backward 
when the axle turns.
An Ackermann steering 
system has a ?xed axle and 
each wheel rotates individu-
ally. In contrast to the wagon 
steering, Ackermann steering 
is angled appropriately at dif-
ferent degrees to match the 
different distances traveled by 
the inside and outside wheels. 
This can help with wear on 
the tires, as well as increas-
ing traction and grip during 
turns. In the Ackermann steer-
ing system, wheels also don’t 
make such large and sweep-
ing movements, so less room 
is needed in the wheel wells.

Neurological basis for perceptual illusions discovered

Optical illusions, such as 
the Penrose staircase or the 
Fraser spiral, shift our per-
ception of reality. 
The idea of a person 
climbing a staircase forever, 
but never getting any higher, 
or of overlapping black and 
white arc segments that seem 
to form a spiral, but are ac-
tually concentric circles, is 
enough to make anyone diz-
zy. But how can we see things 
that aren’t even there?
 New research from Carn-
egie Mellon University Assis-
tant Professor of Biological 
Sciences Sandra J. Kuhlman 
reveals that optical illusions 
may be the product of your 
brain reacting to feedback 
between neurons in differ-
ent parts of the brain’s visual 
system. Understanding this 
feedback has the potential 
to help scientists understand 
how the brain interprets 
sensory stimuli.
 The Kanizsa triangle is an-
other classic optical illusion. 
Through a series of black 
wedges and lines, you think 
you see a clear outline of a 
white triangle in the middle.
 “We see with both our 
brain and our eyes,” said 
Kuhlman in a university press 
release. 
“Your brain is making in-
ferences that allow you to see 
the triangle. It’s connecting 
the dots between the corners 
of the wedges. Optical illu-
sions illustrate some of the 
amazing things our visual 
system can do.”
 This visual system is the 
result of complex interac-
tions between light, our eyes, 
and our brains. 
When the light from an 
object reaches our eyes, 
it travels through circuits 
of neurons in the retina, 
through the thalamus, and 
into the visual cortex of the 
brain. 
The information is then 
processed in multiple stages 
and sent to the prefrontal cor-
tex, where the brain decides

Researchers use CRISPR gene-editing 
to target HIV, might create resistance
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
A team of eight scientists 
from Guangzhou Medical Uni-
versity recently published a pa-
per that outlines their study on 
genetic modi?cation of human 
embryos. The team used a re-
cently developed gene-editing 
tool called CRISPR CRISPR 
(Clustered Regularly Inter-
spaced Short Palindromic Re-
peats) to study a speci?c sec-
tion of the human genome that 
could be used to make humans 
resistant to HIV.
CRISPRs are actually DNA 
sequences in prokaryotic cells 
(e.g. bacterial cells) that help 
protect these cells from invad-
ing viruses. These sequences 
are representative of the vi-
rus’s own genetic material. 
When a virus attacks, these 
CRISPR undergo transcription 
(copying DNA into RNA), and 
the resultant RNA acts as a 
“guided missile.” 
It identi?es the target ge-
netic sequence in the virus that 
matches the RNA and allows 
cell machinery to destroy it. 
By destroying that part of the 
virus’s genome, this process 
stops the virus from replicat-
ing and functioning in its usual 
manner, thereby preventing 
infection. 
This arti?cial method of 
gene-editing involves the 
production of speci?c RNA se-
quences in a laboratory that 
are aimed for a speci?c gene 
(or characteristic) in the target 
animal’s genome. 
This RNA is then used to 
guide cell machinery to that 
location, which then works to 
either silence the gene (not 
allow that characteristic to be 
expressed) or edit the gene 
(change the characteristic). 
The research study that was 
carried out by the team from 
Guangzhou Medical University 
involved introducing a speci?c 
mutation in the CCR5 gene 
called the CCR5-delta32. 
The presence of CCR5-
delta32, found in 20 percent 
of Caucasians, produces some 
form of immunity to HIV and 
hinders the progression of 
the disease. While this study 
produced only four successful 
embryos out of the 26 tested, 
the researchers noted that it 
provided data that would help 
develop a better mechanism 
for gene-editing and under-
standing why pregnancies ter-
minate early.

PUGWASH
THATCHER MONTGOMERY

Pugwash’s meeting last 
week was centered around 
the Panama Papers leak and 
the morality of whistle-blow-
ing in general. In today’s in-
formation age, any leaked 
data spreads around the 
globe almost instantly, with 
no chance to take it back. 
When is it okay to spill the 
beans?
Before discussing the eth-
ics and implications of the 
Panama Papers, some back-
ground must be established. 
Leaked by an anonymous 
source to the German news 
outlet Süddeutsche Zeitung, 
the Papers are comprised 
of 2.6 terabytes of data that 
contain 11.5 million pre-
viously-con?dential docu-
ments detailing the use of tax 
havens by prominent public 
?gures.
To begin with, because 
the source is anonymous, 
there is no knowledge as to 
how the information was 
acquired. And the informa-
tion is enormous: more than 
214,000 companies’ docu-
ments are included, with 
at least ?ve heads-of-state 
involved.
The Panama Papers reveal 
how certain individuals and 
companies utilized tax ha-
vens. A tax haven is a way to 
bypass one’s home country’s 
taxes by stuf?ng money into 
different accounts overseas. 
This is a way not only to keep 
government eyes largely out 
of one’s ?nances, but also 
a way to pay fewer taxes in 
general. By sending money 
to companies in Panama, in-
dividuals and corporations 
could avoid the scrutiny and 
higher tax rates they would 
have had to face in their own 
countries.
Moving money interna-
tionally isn’t a crime; it’s an 
important part of doing busi-
ness. However, some of the 
accounts in Panama are im-
plicated in criminal activities 
like fraud or drug traf?cking. 
Even when it is legal, most 
people don’t have the op-
tion to move money offshore 
to avoid taxes, and many 
feel that doing so is morally 
wrong.
One of the ?rst points 
made in this week’s Pugwash 
meeting was that if all of the 
?nancial activity was legal, 
such as shuf?ing money, then 
there shouldn’t be a problem 
with it being public. Because 
all the rules were followed in 
the transactions, they should 
be open to view. However, a 
counterpoint was that just 
because something is legal 
doesn’t mean it should be 
available for anyone to view.
Another opinion was that, 
in this case, the leak was jus-
ti?ed because it didn’t physi-
cally put anyone in danger, 
and it revealed morally ques-
tionable behavior that might 
be stopped as a result. Simi-
larly, Edward Snowden didn’t 
directly put people in danger 
when he made the public 
aware of large-scale spying. 
In other cases, like Julian As-
sange and WikiLeaks, howev-
er, whistle-blowing might be 
less justi?ed due to the sen-
sitive nature of the material 
released, like on-going, un-
dercover military operations. 
What puts people at risk is 
debatable, though. While 
WikiLeaks did reveal mili-
tary information that might 
have put lives in (more) dan-
ger, Snowden’s leak could 
have prevented the National 
Security Agency from using 
surveillance techniques that 
could have prevented terror-
ist attacks. In a more implau-
sible scenario, the money be-
ing hidden in Panama could 
be being used for positive de-
velopments, which are now 
under attack because of the 
scrutiny brought upon them.
In this particular case 
of the Panama Papers, that 
last scenario is unlikely. It’s 
not inconceivable, however, 
for a situation to arise in 
which hiding money from 
the government isn’t such a 
bad thing, if the government 
of one’s country is corrupt 
or morally bankrupt. The 
Panama Papers seem to give 
governments more power, 
by revealing how people are 
avoiding their oversight, 
whereas Snowden and As-
sange’s leaks were limiting 
the government’s power by 
revealing to the people how 
the government overstepped 
its bounds. It’s important to 
note that the government 
isn’t a single, monolithic en-
tity. While the information 
about surveillance weakened 
the NSA and other govern-
ment programs, it actually 
strengthened the ability of 
the United States Congress 
to legislate against those ac-
tions and rein in those pro-
grams. Whether Congress 
was aware or not of the 
wrongdoings occurring with-
in the government, revealing 
that information to the pub-
lic created a political will for 
change.

Many a person (over the 
age of 21, of course) has wo-
ken up with a pounding head-
ache, forehead resting softly 
in a puddle of vomit against 
the hard, ceramic toilet seat. 
They know the feeling of 
reaching out for the cold, un-
forgiving plastic of the toilet 
paper dispenser to try and lift 
their heads but their necks 
didn’t love the angle they 
slept at and scream in pain 
as they look around to col-
lect their bearings. The ?uo-
rescent lights pound against 
their eyes as they gather 
themselves, climb to their 
feet, and attempt to stumble 
back to their rooms before 
someone notices. You see, our 
friends were experiencing the 
after-effects of alcohol over-
consumption. 
This week’s “How Things 
Work” has a distinctly 
Carnival-themed ?avor: alco-
holic beverages. Drinks with 
large amounts of the drug 
ethanol what we call alco-
holic beverages have been a 
staple of many cultures since 
the invention of fermenta-
tion no later than 6,600 BC. 
It plays a prominent role in 
many religious ceremonies, 
cultural milestones, and other 
social events. Despite making 
speaking physically dif?cult, 
it is occasionally referred to 
as a “social drug” due to its 
prevalence as a gateway to 
“relaxation” or “fun-having,” 
but for many people alcohol 
ends up doing much more 
than just loosening them up 
for an evening out. Ethanol 
has signi?cant effects on peo-
ple who consume it and does 
more to someone’s body than 
party movies let on.
Liquid ethanol is easily 
consumed and absorbed into 
one’s bloodstream through 
the stomach, which is why 
most alcohol consumption oc-
curs from drinking. From the 
bloodstream, it is transport-
ed through the blood to the 
brain, where it begins to do its 
intended job. “Drunkenness” 
occurs when alcohol affects 
the brain’s neurotransmit-
ter pathways, or the circuits 
by which the brain uses mol-
ecules to activate or inhibit 
downstream neurons. The 
most common excitatory neu-
rotransmitter a neurotrans-
mitter that makes your brain 
more likely to send a signal to 
your body affected by alcohol 
is glutamate. Glutamate itself 
is necessary for keeping brain 
activity levels high, which 
helps with learning, memory, 
and cognition, among other 
things. Ethanol inhibits the 
activity of glutamate, effec-
tively reducing these factors. 
Alcohol also increases levels 
of gamma-aminobutyric acid 
(GABA), the brain’s primary 
inhibitory neurotransmitter. 
Since excitatory neurotrans-
mitters increase activity and 
inhibitory neurotransmitters 
decrease it, alcohol’s effects 
classify it as a depressant, or 
a drug which depresses bodi-
ly functions. Slowing down 
glutamate activity causes 
slurred speech and poor mo-
tor function. Increasing GABA 
increases brain inhibition, 
which slows down process-
ing and motor functions even 
further, giving one a sleepy 
feeling. 
However, not all of the 
effects of alcohol consump-
tion involve decreased motor 
function. Once that Vladdy 
and Coke gets into your brain, 
it stimulates the release of 
dopamine in the brain, which 
activates the brain’s reward 
centers. 
This causes feelings of ex-
citement and euphoria and 
makes the person ingesting 
alcohol feel much better. This 
effect is probably most of the 
reason people drink, since in-
creased happiness is a desired 
outcome in most settings. 
While dopamine release is a 
positive in small doses, this 
effect decreases over time. 
Since people enjoy things that 
give them dopamine, people 
who no longer get feelings of 
euphoria from alcohol will 
continue to drink afterwards 
in search of that same high. 
This leads to one of the most 
harmful potential effect of al-
cohol, addiction. Alcohol ad-
diction is sometimes referred 
to as alcoholism.
The brain is not the only 
organ affected by alcohol. 
Livers are often the organ 
most damaged by frequent 
drinking. When you drink too 
much for your liver to process, 
fat can build up and cause sig-
ni?cant harm to your liver. 
Even one binge causes dam-
age to occur, and it builds up 
over time.
While safe, responsible 
alcohol consumption can be 
a fun time, it is important 
to consume in moderation 
and not end up in a situation 
similar to the ?rst paragraph 
of this article or else you risk 
doing long-term harm to 
your body. Alcohol has been 
around for longer than writ-
ten history, but so has mod-
erate consumption. Restraint 
can keep a fun night from 
turning into a vomit-themed 
morning or a liver-themed 
everlasting night.
Alcohol affects neurotransmitter pathways
HOW THINGS WORK
Less room for the wheels 
makes it possible to have 
larger fairings — the outer 
shells used to increase the 
aerodynamic shape of a ve-
hicle. “We’ve taken our bug-
gies to a wind tunnel once or 
twice in the past,” Xu said. 
However, she also made it 
clear that aerodynamics are 
not the most important thing 
in determining buggy speed. 
“As long as you don’t put a box 
on the front, and have it close 
to an airfoil shape, it should 
be ?ne. Buggies don’t go fast 
enough for it to make a big dif-
ference.”
Some of the most impor-
tant parts of buggies that con-
tribute to speed are the wheel 
bearings. Making sure the 
bearings are lubricated, clean, 
and able to spin freely is vital 
to keeping buggies moving 
quickly. The choice of wheels 
on a buggy also makes a huge 
difference, and the kind of 
wheels and treatment they get 
are some of the more closely-
guarded secrets among the 
buggy organizations.
Almost all wheels are made 
from some form of polyure-
thane, a plastics category that 
includes a variety of prod-
ucts, from foam insulation to 
Spandex. The exact kind of 
polyurethane used makes a 
difference, and so does the 
treatment they receive. “If 
you’re watching the races, 
you’ll notice that some bug-
gies don’t come out until may-
be 30 seconds before the gun, 
and then they’re held off the 
ground until right before the 
start,” Xu said. This is because 
the wheels have been treated 
in some fashion, either by 
heat or chemicals. Heating up 
the wheels can improve speed, 
but it also makes the material 
more malleable and liable to 
deform if left sitting on the 
ground. Similarly, chemical 
treatments cause changes in 
the wheels that need to be 
preserved until just before it’s 
go time.
Once the gun has gone off 
and the race has started, the 
main speed factors come in. 
The pushers contribute more 
than half of the ?nal time, 
Xu estimated. Without hav-
ing strong pushers to get up 
the hills, the buggies won’t be 
able to speed down the other 
side on their heated and treat-
ed wheels. Once in the free-
fall portion, the drivers inside 
the buggy take over and deter-
mine which path to take, also 
called a line. Although all bug-
gies are con?ned to the same 
streets of the course, different 
teams and different drivers 
have different opinions as to 
which line is the fastest.
“You want to take the tan-
gent,” Xu explained, mean-
ing the buggy should travel 
smoothly from one corner 
to the next without making 
sharper turns than necessary. 
“Turning really hard will 
scrub speed.” Turning sharply 
also increases the chance of 
the buggy spinning out or 
?shtailing. Despite being a 
competitive race, the teams 
make sure to watch out for 
each other. The morning of 
their heat, the drivers will 
walk the course and plan out 
when possible passes might 
happen. “If a heat is clearly 
non-competitive, with a slow-
er team, a middle team, and 
a faster team, they might not 
talk at all,” Xu said. “But if it’s 
close, they’ll talk about when 
passes might happen to make 
sure there aren’t accidents.” 
The cross-team collaboration 
goes to show their dedication 
to the sport. New members 
are encouraged to ?nd a team 
where they ?t in well with the 
culture and the commitment 
expected, and Xu would rath-
er see someone leave her team 
at CIA and join another team, 
than quit buggy altogether.
Attending a certain num-
ber of rolls — the practice runs 
that take place throughout the 
year — is required to compete 
on race day. “It’s a big commit-
ment! It’s early, but it’s worth 
it. Mechanics get up at 4:00 
[a.m.] and drivers usually ar-
rive around 7:00 [a.m.],” Xu 
said. Hurtling down hills at 
speeds up to 35 miles per hour 
takes a certain kind of person: 
small, of course, but also com-
petitive, con?dent, and not 
claustrophobic. It also takes a 
dedicated team of pushers to 
bring the buggy back up the 
hills, and a support crew of 
mechanics to make sure the 
buggy is as fast as it can be. 
The science and technol-
ogy behind the buggy races 
add an extra layer to an al-
ready fascinating sport, mak-
ing Buggy an interesting 
blend of athletic prowess and 
engineering skill.

Zika virus causes microcephaly, CDC reports
Last Wednesday, sci-
entists at the Centers for 
Disease Control and Pre-
vention (CDC) announced 
that the Zika virus is 
linked to rare birth de-
fects in newborn babies. 
The conclusion was 
made after an extensive 
review of current re-
search, which collectively 
showed the persistence 
of microcephaly, which 
causes calcification of the 
brain in utero and vision 
problems in newborns.
Back in January, the 
mosquito-born disease 
drew the concern of 
global health officials, 
who have been advising 
women, as well as their 
sexual partners, to avoid 
Zika-affected areas if they 
currently are or plan to be 
pregnant. 
While the new CDC 
report, which was pub-
lished in the New England 
Journal of Medicine, does 
not change that advice, 
officials hope that the 
new review will better 
educate the public about 
the potentially damaging 
effects of the virus.

Model solves old mystery of monarch butter?y migration
In a recent paper pub-
lished in the journal Cell 
Reports, scientists have 
modeled the neural mech-
anisms that allow butter-
?ies to make their annual, 
southern migration to 
Mexico. Previously, it was 
unknown how the butter-
?ies used the positioning of 
the sun and their circadian 
rhythms to dictate their 
movement.
Researchers from uni-
versities in Washington, 
Michigan, and Massachu-
setts used information 
from the monarch antenna 
nerves and eyes to gather 
data on the insect’s internal 
clock system and knowl-
edge of the sun’s position. 
A circuit model was then 
formed, revealing an inter-
nal compass that allow the 
monarch butter?y to travel 
on the appropriate course. 
According to Eli 
Shlizerman, a co-author of 
the study, the team hopes 
to build a robotic butter?y 
that would follow and po-
tentially help to maintain 
the monarchs, which are 
decreasing in number.

People found to be resistant to genetic disease
After sifting through 
the genes of 600,000 peo-
ple, scientists discovered 
13 adults that, in spite of 
their genetic mutations, 
managed to avoid certain 
childhood diseases.
The research, which 
was reported in Nature 
Biotechnology, centers on 
the idea that the genes that 
lead to the symptoms of a 
disease are different from 
the genes that cause the 
symptoms of the disease. 
Throughout the study, 
analysis of medical records 
allowed researchers to nar-
row down the number of 
possible ‘escape artists.’ 
However, the research 
was also met with concerns 
by geneticists, who noted 
drawbacks in the sample 
size of ‘genetic superhe-
roes’ that could enable 
discovery of the protective 
genes. In addition, a range 
of factors could alter the 
validity of the ?ndings, in-
cluding environmental and 
unaccounted-for genetic 
factors.

Genetically edited mushroom avoids FDA regulation
Lately, the United States 
Department of Agriculture 
(USDA) stated that it would 
not regulate a genetically 
edited mushroom created 
by Penn State University 
researcher Yinong Yang. 
Before contacting the 
USDA last fall, Yang used 
CRISPR/Cas9, a widely used 
gene-editing technique, to 
remove a piece of DNA from 
a speci?c gene in the white 
button mushroom. 
In turn, he was able to 
alter a gene so that it de-
creased the rate in which the 
enzyme polyphenol oxidase 
was produced, causing the 
mushroom to brown more 
slowly. 
Since new genetic mate-
rial was not introduced, gov-
ernment regulators must de-
cide whether the mushroom 
should be considered as a ge-
netically modi?ed organism. 
Furthermore, some 
scientists believe that 
the USDA should have a 
more systematic way of 
regulating crops that were 
genetically engineered by 
CRISPR, as it could cause 
other, unforeseen genetic 
alterations.

Study suggests fossil fuels to be 
soon phased out
According to a publication 
in the journal Energy Research 
& Social Science, it could take 
as little as a decade for the 
globe to adopt a cleaner ener-
gy system with the aid of tech-
nological advancement and 
appropriate government in-
tervention. In turn, the world 
would no longer have to de-
pend on rapidly depleting 
fossil fuels, which has been 
linked to climate change. Ben-
jamin Sovacool, a professor at 
the University of Sussex, ex-
amined the trends in energy 
transitions over the course 
of history. For instance, he 
found that it took Europe less 
time to adopt electricity as 
an energy source than when 
it was moving from wood to 
coal. Furthermore, he found 
many examples in which 
strong government interven-
tion helped to drive consumer 
demand for these new energy 
sources. For example, France 
experienced almost a dra-
matic increase in its electricity 
supply after implementation 
of a nuclear power program 
back in the 1970s.

Europa’s rapidly deforming ice generates heat
Scientists are looking 
into the chemical makeup 
of one of Jupiter’s moon, 
Europa, which is known to 
have an ocean hidden un-
derneath an icy shell.
In a collaboration be-
tween Brown and Colum-
bia universities, research-
ers found that heat is 
generated on the moon 
through a process called 
tidal dissipation, caused 
by the gravitational pull 
of Jupiter. According to 
Christine McCarthy, one 
of the collaborators, the 
heat produced builds upon 
the tectonic activity and 
melting that have been 
observed on the surface of 
the Europa. 
Tidal pressures on 
Europa’s ice were simu-
lated in a lab, revealing 
deformations in the struc-
ture of ice makes ice more 
dissipative to heat than 
was previously thought. 
In turn, the findings 
could lead to more infor-
mation about the chem-
istry of Europa as NASA 
prepares to search for 
life on the moon during a 
summer mission.

how to respond to the given 
stimulus. But not all neurons 
make it to the prefrontal cor-
tex. In the second stage of 
processing, some neurons 
send information back to 
the ?rst stage of processing 
in a feedback loop, poten-
tially altering the 
signal from 
being sent to the prefrontal 
cortex. Kuhlman’s team 
of colleagues decided to 
explore how the information 
moving backwards from the 
second stage to the ?rst stage 
impacts how it is encoded in 
the visual system. 
In order to do so, they 
needed a way to quantify 
the magnitude of informa-
tion being sent back to the 
?rst stage. They recorded 
normal neuronal ?ring in 
the ?rst stage as a mouse 
looked at moving patterns 
and then silenced the neu-
rons in the second stage us-
ing modi?ed optogenetic 
technology, halting the feed-
back to the second stage and 
allowing them to determine 
how much activity in the 
?rst stage was the result of 
feedback.
 The researchers found 
that around 20 percent of 
neuronal activity in the 
visual cortex was the result 
of feedback, indicating that 
some information we per-
ceive is not a direct response 
to visual stimuli, but to how 
the stimuli are perceived 
by higher cortical areas of 
the brain. This is a concept 
Kuhlman calls reciprocal 
connectivity, and may be 
the reason why our brain 
completes the triangle in the 
Kanizsa triangle optical illu-
sion. “This represents a new 
way to study visual percep-
tion and neural computa-
tion. 
If we want to truly under-
stand 
the visual pathway, and cor-
tical function in general, we 
have to understand these 
reciprocal connection[s],” 
Kuhlman said in a university 
press release.
 Kuhlman is also a member

Hub neuroscience initiative

supposed to be of the people, 
for the people, and by the 
people. One suggestion was 
that this meant that the peo-
ple have a right to know what 
the government is up to, giv-
ing the people the ultimate 
power of the government. A 
counterpoint was that people 
could mean the people as a 
whole, and not as individu-
als — not every John Doe and 
Mary Jane needs to know ev-
ery detail about the govern-
ment activity. And at least in 
the Panama Papers scandal, 
the information leaked isn’t 
about the government, but 
instead about private individ-
uals and corporations. Do the 
people, as a whole or as indi-
viduals, have a right to that?
While Pugwash might not 
have de?nitive answers as to 
the ethics of whistle-blow-
ing in general, one point of 
agreement is that tax havens 
should not be legal. Some-
how, the loophole of sending 
money overseas under the 
guise of “investing” needs to 
be closed. And although the 
Panama Papers only name 
four Americans, this doesn’t 
mean the United States is in 
the clear. Instead, a variety 
of trade laws and ?nancial 
incentives mean that wealthy 
Americans looking to off-
load their money can ?nd 
more easily-accessible tax 
havens in places other than 
Panama. Regardless of the 
morally questionable means 
of gaining awareness, maybe 
the Panama Papers will lead 
to a tighter tax system.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This 
article is a summary of last 
week’s discussion on offshore 
accounts and ?nancial ethics.
PANAMA, from A8
Genetic editing might render humankind resistant to HIV
Reproduction and Genetics, 
the research team points out 
several details that had a huge 
impact on the outcome of the 
experiment. First, the identi-
?cation of a speci?c sequence 
in the genome that would af-
fect a particular characteristic 
is hard to pinpoint, especially 
when it is often the result 
of several genes working to-
gether to produce a single 
characteristic. Second, this 
process needs to be re?ned to 
account for the effects of ge-
netic mosaicism, which is the 
production of two different 
types of cells that in?uence 
the same characteristic of an 
animal. 
The team also highlights 
the need to make the tech-
niques more speci?c, so that 
no unwanted changes in other 
genes take place. In fact, this 
was the most common cause 
behind the unsuccessful em-
bryos. The team concludes 
their paper by stating that 
although the prevention (or 
reduction) of several crippling 
diseases (e.g. Huntington’s 
disease) is conceptually pos-
sible through this technology, 
considering the ethical and 
biological risks in doing so, 
such an invasive procedure 
must only be performed when 
it’s absolutely necessary. Given 
the delicate ethics of genetic 
testing in human embryos, this 
research team used human 
embryos that would not have 
developed, or would have 
been abnormally developed. 
The zygotes were 3PN, which 
means that they contained 
three pronuclei, usually from 
two sperms and one oocyte 
(egg cell) nucleus. 
These zygotes can develop 
substantially in-vitro, but not 
later on, which is why they 
make good test subjects for 
gene-editing processes. In ad-
dition to that, these embryos 
were discarded at most after 
three days. In 2015, another 
study published by a different 
group from Sun Yat-sen 
University in Guangzhou, used 
CRISPR to modify the gene for 
thalassemia. That study was 
the ?rst of its kind and sparked 
off an international debate on 
the ethics surrounding genetic 
experimentation with human 
embryos.  
In December 2015, the In-
ternational Summit on Human 
Gene Editing held at the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences in 
Washington, D.C. concluded 
that while the use of CRISPR 
in the study of “non-viable” 
embryos would bring about a 
revolution in genetic studies, 
production of a human preg-
nancy after modi?cation of 
the zygote and introduction 
of permanent changes in a hu-
man being’s genome would 
be “irresponsible” and off-
limits given the current state 
of the technology and societal 
attitude towards it.  
Despite their support for 
such experimentation under 
the given conditions, such 
research is still ineligible for 
federal funding.

SDC-A secures ?rst in Spring Carnival Buggy competition
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
Last Friday and Saturday, 
organizations from all over 
the Carnegie Mellon campus 
competed in Sweepstakes, bet-
ter known as Buggy, in which 
teams construct a pushable 
vehicle called a buggy and 
then race these buggies on the 
roads near campus. The bug-
gies have one passenger and 
are propelled by a person who 
pushes the vehicle from the 
rear. This yearly competition is 
always a highlight of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Spring Carnival.
The Buggy prelims did 
more than just get things roll-
ing in the competition, as per-
fect weather conditions saw 
incredible performances in 
the qualifying round.  Student 
Dormitory Council’s (SDC) 
men’s A team highlighted the 
round with a record shattering 
2:02.499, over two seconds 
faster than the previous mark.
SDC had huge success that 
day, winning quali?ers with 
both the top women’s team 
and the top men’s team.  SDC 
also crowded the ?nals ?eld 
with their teams, sending both 
the women’s and men’s A, 
B, and C teams to the ?nals.  
With six teams in the ?nals, 
including the top two, this was 
arguably one of the most suc-
cessful days for a single Buggy 
program in history.  
The other teams making 
the ?nals from the women’s 
side were CIA, Fringe, SPIR-
IT, and Fish.  On the men’s 
side CIA, SPIRIT, Fringe, and 
Sigma Phi Epsilon were the 
other squads to make a run to 
the next round. 
In addition to SDC’s three 
teams in the women’s ?nal, 
CIA sent two, with Fringe 
coming a little short of get-
ting a second team into the 
eight-team ?nal. SDC, CIA, 
and Fringe each entered four 
teams on both the women’s 
and men’s sides, and SPIRIT 
entered three teams into the 
women’s race, and four teams 
into the men’s race.
The day started off bright 
and early, with Robo-buggy 
opening up competition with a 
somewhat speedy run, putting 
together a 3:33 performance, 
which was about 20 seconds 
off the mark from last year.  
After the robotic exhibition, it 
was time to get to the women’s 
side of things.
The very ?rst race showed 
a huge jump in competitive-
ness from last year on the 
women’s side, with SDC’s C 
team battling CIA’s B team in 
a near photo-?nish race that 
seemed to be a battle of two 
clear cut ?nalist teams.  CIA 
looked to have a ?ve-second 
lead going into the hill, but a 
late surge by the SDC squad 
brought things down to the 
wire.  With both buggies ?n-
ishing in 2:47, where ?nalists 
from last year often couldn’t 
even break three minutes, it 
looked like the early successes 
would send both teams on to 
victory.
By the end of the women’s 
prelims, it was clear that rac-
ing under the three-min-
ute barrier wasn’t enough 
this year. SDC-C and CIA-B 
squeaked by, taking the last 
2 spots in the ?nal with their 
2:47 results, as Apex’s A team 
came up short with a 2:49.
The race of the day on the 
women’s side came, unsur-
prisingly, from the SDC wom-
en. The A team wrapped up 
day one competition in the 8th 
heat with CIA-A team’s 2:34 as 
the time to beat.
The women blasted out 
from the start, opening ahead, 
and never coming close to los-
ing their lead. Most closely 
pursued by Apex’s A team, the 
SDC women already led by 
about 15 seconds over their 
nearby rivals going up the hill.  
The team built on the lead, 
and challenged for their pre-
vious record time with a 2:26 
?nish, coming up about a sec-
ond short.
The men’s side saw speed 
to compare, with the slowest 
2016 team to qualify, Apex A, 
?nishing in 2:21, 10 seconds 
faster than the 2:31 it took to 
make the ?nal round a year 
ago. With tight competition 
through the day, just like the 
on the women’s side, the best 
was saved for last, with SDC’s 
A team prepared to make a 
seemingly annual run at the 
record books.
With football star Sam 
Benger’s opening push, SDC 
exploded to the lead, blowing 
away the competition in their 
heat in similar fashion to their 
female counterparts a couple 
hours before. A clean roll 
down the hill gave SDC an un-
contested run up Frew Street 
with each of their pushers 
sprinting behind a ?ying bug-
gy. The efforts were rewarded, 
as SDC smashed their previ-
ous course record and brought 
about some talk of an attempt 
at the two-minute barrier in 
the future.
The ?nals saw more domi-
nation from SDC. The men’s 
SDC team A took ?rst place 
overall in the competition 
with CIA A coming in a close 
second. Fringe-A and SPIRIT- 
A took third and fourth re-
spectively. With such an over-
whelming performance as this 
one, SDC will no doubt be the 
favorites yet again coming into 
next year’s event. The weather 
wasn’t the only factor in argu-
ably the fastest buggy-racing 
days in the history of the sport.  
Great weather throughout the 
late winter and spring opened 
up a window for signi?cantly 
more practice for all of the 
Buggy teams than last year. 
This storied Carnegie 
Mellon tradition continues 
to thrive and improve on it-
self every year. Buggy races 
will undoubtedly be a central 
event at Spring Carnival for 
years to come.
NFL Draft bringing dif?cult decisions for Rams, Titans
CLG defends championship in League of Legends ?nals
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
As the date of the National 
Football League (NFL) Draft 
gets closer and closer, teams 
are itching to trade draft 
picks, either to secure higher 
quality players, or to grab 
more talent than the stan-
dard seven allotted picks. On 
Thursday, the Los Angeles 
Rams decided to pay a king’s 
ransom to the Tennessee Ti-
tans, trading away this year’s 
?rst-round pick (No. 15), 
two second-round selections 
(Nos. 43 and 45), and third-
round pick (No. 76) along 
with next year’s ?rst and 
third-round picks in exchange 
for the Titans’ ?rst-round pick 
(No. 1), fourth-round pick 
(No. 113) and sixth-round 
pick (No. 177).
Obviously willing to start 
their ?rst season back in Los 
Angeles with a bang, the 
Rams are looking to secure 
the quarterback position. The 
last time the Rams selected 
number one overall, they got 
quarterback Sam Bradford, 
who almost led them to a di-
vision title in his rookie year 
before spending the next 
years plagued by injury. With 
the Cleveland Browns picking 
number two overall looking 
once again for a quarterback 
to change their fate, the Rams 
needed to go all the way to 
number one if they wanted to 
get the guy they want.
Now, the Rams are fo-
cused entirely on two players: 
North Dakota State University 
quarterback Carson Wentz 
and University of California, 
Berkeley quarterback Jared 
Goff. With both Los Angeles 
and Cleveland likely to take 
both of them off the board, 
this would mark the second 
year in a row the top two picks 
were quarterbacks. Jameis 
Winston has the Tampa Bay 
Buccaneers optimistic about 
the future, and Marcus Mari-
ota has Tennessee convinced 
enough to not chase after 
Wentz or Goff.
The decision between 
Wentz and Goff could be criti-
cal to the futures of the Rams 
and the Browns. In the 2012 
NFL Draft, the Indianapolis 
Colts selected Stanford quar-
terback Andrew Luck ?rst 
overall, and the Washington 
Redskins took Baylor quarter-
back Robert Grif?n III second 
overall. Though Luck did not 
perform well in 2015, his ?rst 
three years have shown in-
credible promise, taking the 
Colts from the worst team in 
the league in 2011 to compet-
ing against the Patriots for the 
right to play in Super Bowl 
XLIX. Grif?n, meanwhile, 
had a great rookie campaign 
before suffering an injury and 
subsequently ?zzling in D.C.
A more stark contrast be-
tween the ?rst and second 
overall quarterbacks can 
be seen from the 1998 NFL 
Draft. The Indianapolis Colts 
took University of Tennessee 
quarterback Peyton Manning 
?rst overall while the San Di-
ego Chargers selected Wash-
ington State University quar-
terback Ryan Leaf second. 
Manning would go on to have 
a legendary career, going out 
on top with the Denver Bron-
cos. Leaf became the poster 
child of poor work ethic and 
drug problems.
Much is at stake for the 
Rams to get this pick right. 
The same goes for the Titans 
to use their picks to build a 
team around Mariota. It’s a 
complicated balance of sur-
rounding Mariota with talent 
at skill positions (running 
backs, wide receivers), pro-
tecting him with good offen-
sive linemen, and building a 
defense that will keep feeding 
the offense opportunities to 
score. If they play their cards 
right, the Titans stand to gain 
a number of quality players 
that will help them compete 
in the AFC South. If not, they 
may wind up wondering what 
to do with a high draft pick 
next year with more questions 
than answers.

The League of Legends 
playoff ?nals took place on 
Sunday, and over half a mil-
lion people tuned in to watch 
the action. League of Leg-
ends is a video game played 
by teams of ?ve players that 
each controls a character, 
known as a champion. These 
champions duke it out on a 
fantasy battle?eld known as 
Summoner’s Rift, using magi-
cal abilities and attacks to 
defeat their opponents. The 
Rift has three lanes: bottom, 
middle, and top along with a 
jungle in between. Teams all 
over the world play this game 
professionally, practicing for 
multiple hours every day to 
hone their skills. The best of 
these teams face off in season-
style format called the League 
Championship Series (LCS) 
to determine the best of the 
best over three months. That 
season concluded, and the 
playoffs began. Teams had to 
make their way through the 
bracket, battling each other 
in best-of-?ve series until only 
two teams remained to ?ght 
for the championship. This 
was the situation going into 
Sunday.
The North American ?nal 
featured two of the biggest 
names in League of Legends 
and the most storied rivalry 
in the game. Team SoloMid 
(TSM) against Counter Logic 
Gaming (CLG) is always the 
most anticipated matchup in 
North America, whether it 
is in playoffs or the regular 
season. To make the rivalry 
even more intense, at the be-
ginning of the season TSM ac-
quired the star player of CLG, 
Yiliang “Doublelift” Peng in 
the most surprising trade the 
esports community has ever 
seen. Doublelift has long been 
heralded as one of the best 
players in the west, and when 
he left CLG for rival TSM, fans 
of both teams were shocked. 
That trade means this rivalry 
is more heated than ever, be-
cause Doublelift was out to 
prove that he made the right 
decision in switching teams 
and CLG was out to prove that 
they never needed Doublelift 
in the ?rst place.
Game one began with an 
early TSM lead, and each 
team played very cautiously, 
surely due to the nerves from 
the sheer magnitude of the 
game. Once the players got 
comfortable however, the 
game quickly picked up. TSM 
held a signi?cant lead until 
the 28-minute mark, when 
CLG took a favorable ?ght 
and wiped TSM off Rift. This 
was the beginning of the end 
for TSM in game one, because 
they never found their way 
back into the lead. Once CLG 
got ahead, the game was over 
within ten minutes and TSM 
realized they had their work 
cut out for them if they want-
ed to take the series. 
Game two started much in 
the same way as the ?rst, with 
TSM taking an early lead. But 
this time, TSM did not sit back 
and watch CLG recover. TSM 
kept their lead in game two by 
maintaining their aggression 
throughout the entire game, 
which kept the CLG side 
against the ropes until they 
could not stand any longer. 
TSM looked to have regained 
their con?dence and closed 
out game two in a convinc-
ing fashion, tying the series 
at 1–1.
Game three started out 
much closer than the previous 
two. TSM secured two early 
kills, but CLG soon equalized 
that advantage and found 
themselves with a lead of their 
own before the 20-minute 
mark.  The teams continued to 
?ght back and forth, but CLG 
seemed to come out slightly 
ahead in nearly every engage-
ment, preventing TSM from 
gaining an advantage. After 
endless small victories, CLG 
found themselves with a very 
large lead until a chaotic ?ght 
broke out around the 40-min-
ute mark. TSM used clever 
positioning to dismantle the 
heavy team ?ghting composi-
tion of CLG and signi?cantly 
reduced the lead of CLG. The 
very next ?ght would decide 
the game, and CLG took it 
for themselves. 
Thanks to stellar play from 
Trevor “Stixxay” Hayes, CLG 
avoided the threats of TSM 
and ultimately thrived in the 
extended ?ght to take game 
three. One more win and CLG 
would take home the North 
American LCS championship 
for the second split in a row.
But as history would have 
it, TSM did not give up. In 
game four, TSM reverted to 
the composition that had won 
them game two and went on 
to complete dismantle CLG. 
TSM played the classic “Pro-
tect the Doublelift” compo-
sition, a strategy that CLG 
knows all too well from the 
days when Doublelift was on 
CLG. They could not break 
the wall of protection the 
TSM had set up for their carry 
player, and CLG were eventu-
ally choked out. With the se-
ries tied 2–2, more than half 
a million people were on the 
edge of their seats.
Game ?ve was the closest 
of the series. For more than 
40 minutes, the teams traded 
back and forth evenly and nei-
ther could ?nd an advantage. 
That was until the last fate-
ful ?ght, when TSM’s Kevin 
“Hauntzer” Yarnell attempted 
an engage thinking his team 
had a positional advantage. 
It did seem that way at ?rst, 
but CLG’s Stixxay had other 
plans. 
He found a way to deal 
enough damage to kill ev-
eryone on TSM, and then 
easily marched through the 
TSM base with his remain-
ing teammates. CLG had de-
feated the fan favorites and 
proved to everyone that they 
didn’t need their former star 
player to be the best team in 
North  America.

Opening Ceremony
Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival 2016 
officially began on Thursday morning 
at the opening ceremonies, which 
included the Spring Carnival Committee, 
Carnegie Mellon Pipes and Drums, and 
Scotty, Carnegie Mellon’s mascot. 
The ceremony was accompanied by 
various other events including the 
Alumni Welcome, Buggy Showcase, 
Faculty & Staff Open House, and a kiltie

With Midway shifted to the heart of campus, and the 
warm lights of the Carnival rides illuminating the 
Cut, I marched my way over to the booths, camera 
in tow, at around 7:30 p.m. Saturday night. Why so 
late? Well, for one it made room for unobstructed 
photographs, and the blazing sun that we’d been 
blessed with this weekend had finally gone down. 
Additionally it gave the booths a chance to speak 
for themselves. The absence of daylight allowed 
the intricately wired lights to guide the way and 
showcase the best assets of each booth.
This year’s booth theme was “Game Night,” and 
brought with it many childhood classics, much to 
everyone’s delight. From Skyrim and Mario to Oregon 
Trail and Mouse Trap, each booth gave its visitors 
the opportunity to immerse themselves in the realms 
of the games that we’ve all come to know and love.

While the booths were beautifully done, one concern 
that I shared with many friends who had also taken 
up the challenge of night excursions was the issue of 
safety.  
There were booths with dark stairways that were not 
well-lit, where tripping was imminent and frequent. 
Perhaps a strip of white paint lining the edge of each 
step would help to ensure better visibility, especially 
for poorly lit booths that plan to stay open at night. 
That being said, the winners for this year showed 
excellence in terms of safety, adherence to theme, 
and incredibly detailed design.The winner for the 
fraternities this Carnival was Delta Tau Delta’s 
Luigi’s Mansion, which boasted detailed portraits, 
the haunted likes of Boo, and lurking shadows that 
thrived in the darkness of the night. In second place 
was Sigma Phi Epilson’s Legend of the Hidden 
Temple booth, where I was greeted by a skillfully 
crafted, large, red-eyed stone [see page 8]

[continued from page 6] head that told the story of Andrew Carnegie and 
Andrew Mellon with a deep voice that echoed resolutely throughout the 
structure. Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Dungeons & Dragons took third, complete with 
a tavern, skeletons, and an ominous sign reading “ABANDON ALL HOPE YE 
WHO ENTER HERE.”
Out of the six sorority booths, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s Mario Party stole the 
show. Of all the booths I had the pleasure of entering this weekend, the artwork 
of this booth was perhaps the most true to its theme, with beautiful rainbows, 
Bowser’s throne, and an encouraging “You are the superstar” posted at the exit 
in the signature Mario Party font. Kappa Alpha Theta’s Oregon Trail brought 
the classic game of conquering the western frontier to life with great furnishing 
and a nice Carnegie Mellon twist, featuring the likes of our very own Scotty.
In third was Delta Gamma’s Where in the World Is Carmen Sandiego? which 
included beautiful tributes to the cultures of the world ranging from Chinese 
lanterns to a golden sarcophagus.
The independent booths this year were very impressive. In first place was 
KGB’s endearingly strange and cleanly executed Octodad. The booth was full 
of bright portraits of the titular character with his family. The booth was simple 
and tasteful, with enough quirkiness to keep anyone giggling throughout its 
interior. In second was Fringe’s homage to the world of LEGO®. The structure 
not only resembles a LEGO® building, but also included accurate depictions of 
LEGO® people, complete with smiling faces and painted-on clothing. In third

was the Taiwanese Students Association’s 
Skyrim, which embodied the iconic game 
with incredible finesse. The booth included a 
cobble-stone exterior, detailed portraits and 
figures and bright lights that brought the 
atmosphere of Skyrim to life.
The Astronomy Club took home first place in 
the blitz category for their booth of everyone’s 
favorite Windows ME game, Space Cadet 
Pinball. The booth was decorated with 
key features of the games’ layout and was 
perpetually crowded, even well into the night. 
In second was the Mellon College of Science’s 
“Pac-Man,” which was unfortunately closed 
by the time I got there. Its exterior was very 
well composed, as was expected of last 
year’s winners. In third was the Math Club’s 
Mathematical Puzzles, which, as its name 
suggests, was full of puzzles for booth-goers to 
take a moment to unravel.
By my standards, the winners were all well-
deserving, but it is worth noting that the 
hard work put in by all the participating 
organizations did not go to waste. Alpha 
Phi’s Mouse Trap, for example, was chock-
full of adorable mice, including one particular 
larger than life mouse trapped behind a grid. 
As a huge Kirby fan, I was also incredibly 
appreciative of what the Asian Students 
Association put up.
The booths this year echoed the sentiments 
of our past and present favorite pastimes, and 
with Midway positioned right next to the rides 
that brought out my inner child, I found myself 
spellbound.

Rides at Midway
This year, for the first time, the 
Midway rides were spread across 
the College of Fine Arts lawn 
instead of the Morewood Parking 
Lot. This location change made for a 
very different vibe; being perched on 
a Ferris Wheel in the heart of cam-
pus surrounded by the vibrant fes-
tivities and lights of Spring Carnival 
has an endearing sense of charm to 
it. As for the view of campus from 
the top of the ride, it’s unbeatable.

of hair care, but her pain and self doubt are gut-
wrenchingly real just the same. This show got some 
very lucky breaks in terms of casting. Stentz was 
one of them. When she started singing, I’m pretty 
sure every jaw in the room dropped.  Small, adorable, 
and, most importantly, blonde, she’s a perfect match 
for Elle. Don’t think for a second that’s why she got 
the role, though. First-year vocal performance major 
Marina Byrne, who played Elle’s rival and eventual 
friend Vivienne, and junior vocal performance major 
Grace Lazos, who took the stage as the sweet and 
timid, yet hilarious hairdresser Paulette, were also 
uncannily suited for their roles. 
Stentz and Byrne both raised chills with their 
soaring renditions of the final number, “Legally 
Blonde,” while Lazos broke hearts as she belted 
out “Bend and Snap.” More instrumentally inclined 
folks were not disappointed either. First-year vocal 
performance major Caleb Glickman took command 
of the pit and whipped them into shape. Legally 
Blonde has a relatively large pit, which presents all 
kind of difficulties, both logistically and musically. 
Glickman made it all look seamless come show time, 
transitioning in and out of his cameo as a JetBlue 
pilot with an effortless flag twirl. Though, what was 
really special about this show was not the musical 
talent, it was the people. As you may have noticed by 
now, there was an unusually high number of first-
years in the show. 
Director Adam Lerner, a first-year himself, explained 
the situation, “So many of us were in our roles for the 
first time. I had never directed before and some of 
the actors had never been on stage before. We found 
ourselves all feeling like underdogs. During our first 
production meeting, we had 17 people in the room 
and after a quick count we found that more than 60 
percent of us were freshmen.”
The real-life struggles and victories of this underdog 
cast seeped through into the show. From the start, 
Lerner and Glickman saw Legally Blonde as the 
show of the underdog. Back when the show was still 
just a wee little proposal before the S’n’S Board of 
Directors, Lerner laid out his vision, saying “Elle’s 
fish-out-of-water appearance in comparison to her 
Harvard peers pits her as an underdog. Elle tries 
to stay true to herself, never failing to be a ray of 
sunshine. The finale song is introduced with the line 
‘being true to yourself never goes out of style.’ This is 
[the] final message that I want the audience to walk 
out with: Even an underdog can succeed, but you 
can’t lose yourself in the journey.” He couldn’t have 
known the kind of cast he would have, but it’s spooky 
how well it aligned.
The show was not flawless. There were missed 
pitches and tech glitches a-plenty. That’s what you 
get with amateur theater, and it’s hardly the point. 
The point is to make the audience buy into the 
experience you want them to have. And I can attest 
that we bought in. We jeered when Elle’s boyfriend 
broke up with her, screamed in disgust when her 
boss hit on her, and hooted and hollered like proud 
parents at her valedictorian speech.
Lerner and his pack of underdogs pulled off a show 
with one of the largest casts in S’n’S history, sold 
out all of the evening shows, and had some of the 
best attended matinées in recent history, earning the 
production the nickname “the show of dreams” from 
the Board of Directors. 
Lerner summed up the experience, saying, “The final 
show was beyond our wildest dreams ... So many 
aspects of the show that were expected to fail came 
together and made the show what it was.” The S’n’S 
team set out to bring us the story of an underdog 
defying all odds and excelling beyond anyone’s 
dreams. They accidentally brought us two.

[ Sinead Foley  |  Forum Editor ]
At 11 p.m. on Friday the hall outside Rangos was 
buzzing with funnel-cake-fueled excitement as we 
waited for the doors to open on Scotch’n’Soda’s 
(S’n’S) annual Carnival show. S’n’S went with a 
crowd pleaser, Legally Blonde, for this year’s show, 
and tickets were evaporating fast. By the time the 
eager crowd spilled into Rangos, already singing the 
opening theme, every seat was sold. They would be 
full every night of the show, and deservingly so.
Legally Blonde traces the story of Elle Woods, a 
brilliant, ditzy, and resilient sorority girl from Malibu, 
played by sophomore electrical and computer 
engineering and biomedical engineering double 
major Tara Stentz, as she works her way to the top of 
the class at Harvard law school. 
What starts off as a harebrained scheme to get her 
boyfriend back after he dumps her for not being 
“serious” enough, quickly morphs into a tale of 
defying stereotypes, self discovery, and learning how 
to stand on your own. It’s a story that’s always funny 
and, when done well, surprisingly emotional.
From the moment the curtain went up it was clear 
the rowdy crowd had met its match. Legally Blonde 
is a larger than life, all or nothing story, and this 
cast definitely went all in. The show starts in Elle’s 
University of California, Los Angeles sorority, where 
the sisters of Delta Nu are preparing to congratulate 
her on what they assume is her upcoming 
engagement. 
Elle’s best friends Margot, Serena, and Pilar, played 
by Dietrich first-years AnnaJamieson Beck and 
Heather Graci, and mechanical engineering and 
engineering and public policy first-year Elizabeth 
Elrod respectively, lead the opening ensemble 
number, “Omigod You Guys.” It’s hard to describe 
the sheer squeaky force of this song. Beck, Graci, 
and Elrod flung themselves into the rolls of extreme 
sorority girls, bouncing and squealing with so much 
energy it was almost terrifying. We bounced along 
with them, caught up in the frenzy.
The energy didn’t stop after the opener. Each new 
character and singing number piled more life and 
laughs into the show. Legally Blonde is a careful 
balancing act. With a ridiculous storyline and larger 
than life characters, the musical totters at the edge 
of the audience’s suspension of disbelief. It’s the 
honest emotion of the cast that brings it back from 
the precipice. Sure, Elle might have a talking dog 
and win court cases using her extensive knowledge

[ Krishna Rao  |  Staffwriter ]
Holi was celebrated on campus this Saturday as hundreds 
of people took to the Hamerschlag Hall lawn (The Mall) 
to participate in the seasonal tradition. This year’s event 
brought in over a thousand people from all corners of the 
diverse Carnegie Mellon community. The celebration was 
organized by OM, the South Asian spiritual club. OM has 
coordinated Holi celebrations on campus in previous years. 
Each year a different tag line is used to keep the event 
current and trendy. This year the event was promoted as 
1-800-HOLIBLING: CMU Holi 2016, a play on the popular 
Drake song, “Hotline Bling.”
Holi has exploded across college campuses and other 
venues in the United States within the last several years. 
Much of Holi’s success and spread can be attributed to 
social media, popular entertainment, media, and the pure 
and simple fun of it. The tradition of throwing colored 
powder has been adapted to color runs, music festivals, and 
other outdoor springtime activities around the nation.
The main part of the celebration involves smearing colored 
powder on participant’s faces in a spontaneous, lively 
atmosphere. In India, Holi is not contained to just college 
campuses and select events. Holi happens on one day 
across the whole country. In a nation often divided by its 
brimming diversity, it is the one day people of different 
backgrounds can come together to engage in play. Holi is 
regarded as a time of new beginnings; a time of rebirth and 
rejuvenation.
In the United States, Holi has become a tradition with its 
own unique eccentricities and mainstays in its own right. 
Many American Holi events, for example, feature music, 
DJs, and performers, with contemporary Bollywood and 
western music. The events are usually organized and held 
in large venues and open locations rather than on city 
streets. For ?rst-year information systems major Shubhangi 
Bhotika, who grew up in India, HOLIBLING at Carnegie 
Mellon was a truly unique experience.
“When I play Holi in India, I prefer playing with a small 
group of friends on the streets or a smaller more isolated 
location. It is also preferable to play with colors mixed with 
water, and we like using a variety of stuff like water guns 
and water balloons,” she said. HOLIBLING was, for the 
most part, a “dry Holi,” using colored rice-?our powder. In 
India, water games in addition to powder are cornerstones 
of Holi.
Bhotika added, “HOLIBLING was really different in 
[the] number of people I played with, the very public 
location, use of dry [and] powdered colors, the music and 
performances. It was pretty awesome and is still quite 
similar to Holi back home, but de?nitely has its differences. 
I equally enjoy both styles.”
This year’s Holi was celebrated on March 24 around the 
world. This date marks the end of winter by the Hindu 
calendar and the last full moon of the month Phalgun, and 
this can vary from February to March on the Gregorian 
calendar. The Carnegie Mellon celebration was held off 
in order to coincide with Spring Carnival and warmer 
weather.
Preparations started weeks in advance, when orders 
were sent out for white t-shirts for those who pre-ordered 
tickets. On the day of the event, OM board members 
worked tirelessly to ensure that the surrounding academic 
buildings were inaccessible to the participants, catered 
food was in place for serving, and people knew where to go. 
Around noon, a crowd began to form near Baker Hall and 
Porter Hall. After tickets were checked, all the participants 
were served an Indian vegetarian meal from the Coriander 
India Grill. Anticipation built as the crowd could tell the real 
fun was about to start. Colors began to ?y at around 1:15 
p.m. as the lawn erupted into clouds of powder. Once inside 
the crowd, it was impossible to avoid being spattered with 
bright hues of pink, yellow, light blue, and purple. As the 
initial excitement began to slow down, the dance teams 
began to perform, once again elevating the energy levels of 
the crowd. The color throwing soon became a free-for-all, 
as it became increasingly dif?cult to recognize individuals 
under the coats of colored powder.
“The atmosphere was amazing; unlike anything I can 
remember. I liked how everybody threw the colors at 
everybody whether they knew them or not. It all played 
into an environment where everyone was dancing and 
happy,” said ?rst-year Dietrich student Theo Yannekis, who 
experienced Holi for the ?rst time. Many ?rst-timers were 
surprised how fun such a simple activity can be. Indeed, 
Holi seems to be gaining traction not only around the rest 
of the nation, but here at Carnegie Mellon, with this year 
garnering  over 1,000 people in attendance to create one 
of the largest crowds so far. Curious alumni and members 
of the general public who were visiting for Carnival were

curious to see what was happening, and some even 
gathered to watch the performances and take pictures of 
the colorful participants.
In all the excitement and celebration, it can be easy to forget 
that Holi is a very ancient practice, which has signi?cance 
beyond having fun. Recent articles published by NPR 
and other outlets have brought up the issue of Holi being 
used as cultural appropriation, whereby Indian culture is 
misrepresented by placing a heavy emphasis on Holi. This 
was in response to Coldplay and Beyonce’s recent release, 
“Hymn for the Weekend,” which features an Indian Holi 
celebration.
Holi is a tradition that has its roots in Hinduism. There are 
several themes that the festival celebrates; colors are used 
to symbolize the coming of spring and the end of winter. 
Another popular theme is the triumph of good over evil, 
which is the basis for a popular folk story on the origin of 
Holi. As the story goes, there was once an evil king named 
Hiranyakashipu in ancient India. His young son, Prahlad, 
instead of swearing allegiance to his father, worshiped the 
god Shiva. Hiranyakashipu ordered his sister, Holika, who 
had the power to withstand ?ames, to carry Prahlad into a 
bon?re. As Prahlad was being carried into the ?re, he prayed 
calmly. Holika burned to ashes and Prahlad walked out of 
the ?re unscathed. In India, the bon?res lit on Holi night 
commemorate Prahlad’s devotion, and the death of Holika. 
Despite the tradition, many people, even in India, celebrate 
Holi just for fun. The entertainment of Holi is a factor which 
will continue to make it universally appealing. However, it is 
important to at least recognize that it has a deeper meaning.
Despite some minor hassles, HOLIBLING at Carnegie 
Mellon was largely successful. The event was delayed 
slightly due to the long lines. Because some participants did 
not pick up t-shirts during the tabling period, they were not 
guaranteed one at the event. Ultimately, the large crowds 
were managed successfully, and the issues with t-shirt 
orders were resolved before the main event started.
OM President and junior computer science major Bharadwaj 
Ramachandran said “Because of the new venue at The Mall, 
people were able to stay closer together, and the event was 
accessible to people crossing campus during Carnival. That 
de?nitely extended our audience this year.” In previous 
years, Holi was held on Flagstaff Hill in Schenley Park. Last 
year, it was held for the ?rst time on campus, on the CFA 
lawn. Each year, attendance has increased. Ticket sales 
were also increased due to a boost in last-minute sales from 
interested onlookers eager to partake in the action.
True to its name, “Hotline Bling” was played as the event 
was wrapping up.

Sweepstakes, colloquially known as Buggy, is one of Carnegie Mellon’s most legendary and 
unique traditions. Teams construct small, high-performance, pushable vehicles called buggies and 
compete by racing them around a track. For uphill sections, buggies are propelled by pushers who 
hold the rear handle-bar and sprint at top speed. For downhill sections, buggies are controlled by 
drivers, usually girls shorter than 5’2”, lying down inside these buggies. This year, Student Dormitory 
Council’s A Team shattered previous records with a full circuit time of 2:02.499, over two seconds 
faster than the previous record.
