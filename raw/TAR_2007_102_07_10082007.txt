Locked and Loaded
Students will 
have to shell 
out for 
lock­
outs

On Tuesday, 
Carnegie Mel- 
students 
in cam­
pus housing 
received an 
e-mail from Housing and 
Dining Services announcing the im­
position of charges for temporary 
keys when students lock themselves 
out ofthier dorm rooms. The initial 
temporary key is free of charge; each 
additional incident incurs a charge 
that increases in $5 increments. In 
addition, students who lose their IDs 
must pay $25, up from the previous 
$15, for a replacement.
Students living in the Oakland 
Community Apartments — Webster 
Hall, Fairfax Apartments, Cathedral 
Mansions, London Terrace, Neville 
Apartments, Shady Oak Apartments 
and Veronica Apartments — will be 
charged $60 for losing their metal 
keys. Moreover, students who re­
side in Webster and Fairfax, both 
of which use key-fobs in addition to 
metal keys, will be charged an addi­
tional $25 for losing the key-fob.
The key-fob is a small, electronic- 
access device provided to the resi-
swiped in 
the designated area at the 
building’s entrance, will allow the 
resident in.
“The reason behind these costs is 
to encourage students to be respon­
sible residents and individuals,” said 
Kim Abel, director of Housing and 
Dining.
The policies discussed in the 
e-mail are by no means new, according
to Abel and her staff.
“The lock-out charges have 
been in existence for about four 
years now. Furthermore, they are 
explicitly stated in The Undergradu­
ate Student Guide to Housing and 
Dining Services, which all students 
receive during Orientation week,” 
said Sherra Moors, a staff member at 
Housing and Dining.
Moors also said that the key-fobs 
provided to students in Webster and 
Fairfax apartments are the property 
of the residential complexes.
All other university housing resi­
dences are accessible to students via 
their student ID cards.
Students who hold their housing 
access on their student ID card may 
request a temporarily activated ac­
cess key upon losing their card, as 
stated in The Undergraduate Stu­
dent Guide to Housing and Dining 
Services.
Off-campus residents with hard 
metal keys are instructed to contact 
the office of Housing and Dining 
Services during normal hours (8:30 
a.m.-7 p.m. Monday through Thurs­
day and 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. Friday), 
and University Police after-hours and 
on weekends, should they misplace 
their keys or key-fobs. University 
Police will give them access to their 
apartments by providing them with 
a spare key. Students are expected to 
return the spare key to Housing and 
Dining within 24 hours.
“We usually send out the actual 
notification regarding lock-outs by 
midterm each year, so that students 
have settled in and are more aware 
of their surroundings. We have fol­
lowed exactly the same procedure 
this time around,” Abel said.
The handbook also states that funds 
collected for lock-outs contribute 
to the maintenance and improve­
ment of the SafeWalk program, a 
nighttime escort service provided 
to Carnegie Mellon students in or­
der to ensure their safety during late 
hours.
“Our students are our respon­
sibility. To help them adapt to the 
Carnegie Mellon culture, while tak­
ing into consideration their safety, is 
our obligation,” Abel said.
Through this policy, students are 
encouraged to take particular care of 
their keys, and as a result, save their 
roommates, the contracting resi­
dences, and Carnegie Mellon a lot of 
trouble, Abel said.
Copies of The Undergraduate Stu­
dent Guide to Housing and Dining 
Services handbook are available in 
the Office of Housing and Dining 
Services and the University Center.

Columbia row raises ques­
tions about CMU policies
by Stuti Pandey
Junior Staffwriter
In his now-infamous speech at 
Columbia University on Sept. 24, 
Iranian President Mahmoud Ah- 
madinejad declared “We do not 
have homosexuals, like in your 
country ... we do not have this 
phenomenon.” This was one of 
many statements Ahmadinejad 
made that offended students and 
educators, leading Columbia and 
other universities to defend or re­
vise their policies on whose views 
should be allowed on campus.
Currently, President Bush 
refuses to hold talks with Ah­
madinejad on political grounds; 
therefore, many wonder why the 
president of Iran was in New York 
City last month. Columbia was 
hosting a World Leaders Forum, 
in which Ahmadinejad was in­
vited to speak — an incident that 
has sparked much controversy.
Many discouraged Columbia’s 
actions to prevent Ahmadinejad 
from speaking. Sheldon Silver 
of the New York State Assem­
bly threatened to withdraw
the university’s state sup­
port; students, and neighbor­
hood residents held protests.
One of the biggest points
of controversy was Columbia 
President Lee C. Bollinger’s in­
troduction of his guest, in which 
he called Ahmadinejad a “petty 
and cruel dictator,” stating that 
Ahmadinejad’s denial of the Ho­
locaust made him “either bra­
zenly provocative or astonish­
ingly uneducated.”
Carnegie Mellon faculty mem­
ber Peter Madsen criticized 
Bollinger’s introduction.
“He wasn’t only critical. His 
introduction was insulting, 
purposefully insulting,” said 
Madsen, an associate philoso­
phy professor. “I don’t think it’s 
wrong to do that; the man does 
have a nasty record and accusa­
tions against him. [Bollinger] 
was within his rights to insult 
him in that way.”
Carnegie Mellon President 
Jared Cohon supported Bol­
linger’s handling of the situation.
“It’s a hard decision to make 
and I respect the decision he 
made,” Cohon said.
Cohon read a New York Times 
article in which a Columbia stu­
dent said that she had “never 
felt so engaged in what’s hap­
pening in the world as I do right

POG fasts for peace
by Katie Zemel
Junior Staffwriter
Sept. 30 marked the end of 
the 26-day fast and protest 
against military recruitment 
in Pittsburgh organized by the 
Pittsburgh Organizing Group 
(POG). The demonstration took 
place outside Oakland’s main 
military recruiting station on 
Forbes Avenue.
The POG recognized the fast 
as their most ambitious pro­
test effort yet. Member Patrick 
Young explained that protesters’ 
participation served two func­
tions; first, as a demonstration of 
the protesters’ personal beliefs, 
and second, as a continual pres­
ence (campout) and a symbol of 
militarism.
“We chose to do this to take an 
opportunity to really reflect on 
what we’ve done and are going 
to do for the anti-war movement 
over the next couple years,” 
Young said. .
The POG’s goal is “to contrib­
ute to the movement working 
for the immediate withdrawal 
of all US troops from Iraq, and 
an end to military recruitment 
in Pittsburgh,” according to the
organization’s website.
POG member Laney Trautman 
said she participated because the 
wanted to help build the com­
munity.
“We’re taught to watch our 
backs instead of watching out 
for each other,” Trautman ex­
plained.
Protesters decided to hold the 
protest during the month of Sep­
tember because they felt it was 
a pivotal month politically, with 
people everywhere redefining 
what they think of the war, they 
explained.
A main goal was to spark de­
bate, according to POG member 
Mike Butler.
“We were able to keep [the 
War in Iraq] at the forefront of 
people’s thoughts and discus­
sions,” Butler said.
Butler was one of the fasters 
but had to stop before the end of 
the month because he reached 
a point when he became too 
unhealthy to continue, he said. 
Nevertheless, Butler felt that 
the fast was a success and that 
it made a big impact on the Oak­
land area and local colleges.

“We all live in Jena” was the message of the 
National Student Walk-Out that took place Oct. 1. 
A group of Carnegie Mellon students participated 
in the protest to support the Jena 6, a group of 
black high school students who were excessively 
charged with crimes stemming from a fight with a 
white classmate in Jena, La. Over 100 colleges par­
ticipated nationwide, according to SPIRIT president 
Chloe Taylor, a senior history and international 
relations major.
Taylor led a group of about 35 Carnegie Mellon 
students and joined hundreds of students nation­
wide in the National Student Walk-Out. At 1 p.m. 
Oct. 1, Carnegie Mellon students gathered at the 
Fence and prepared for the two-hour march to the 
District Attorney’s Office, located downtown in the 
Allegheny County Courthouse roughly four miles 
from campus. Carnegie Mellon students were the 
first group to begin marching; the group grew as 
protesters joined from the University of Pittsburgh, 
Carlow University, Duquesne University, and local 
high schools.
Taylor was proud of the spirit that Carnegie Mellon
students brought to the protest.
“We brought the energy from the beginning and 
set the tone,” Taylor said.
Taylor learned about the walk-out from activ­
ists from Sankofa Community Empowerment who 
asked her to urge Carnegie Mellon students to par­
ticipate. “It was great to see CMU students take an 
active stand on an important issue.”
Protesters joined with people oh the street as 
they chanted “Justice for Jena” and “No peace, no 
justice,” according to Luther Young III, a sophomore 
industrial design major. Young had heard about 
recent proceedings in Jena on NPR about a week 
before the protest and felt compelled to join the 
protest.
“I just knew it was something I had to participate 
in,” Young said.
Adam Schloss, a senior in physics and public pol­
icy and management and president of Hillel, was 
also compelled to join Carnegie Mellon students at 
the walk-out. He had seen posters for the protest 
and met with Taylor the day before the walk-out.
“I wanted to get involved because of the histori­
cal ties between Jewish and black people,” Schloss 
said, noting that African-Americans and Jews share

Fienberg and gen ed mark milestones for H&SS
Fienberg inducted into Academy
Stephen E. Fienberg, Maurice Falk 
professor of statistics and social sci­
ence at Carnegie Mellon, was inducted 
into the American Academy of Arts and 
Sciences at a ceremony in Cambridge, 
Mass., Saturday.
Fienberg was among this year’s 202 
new fellows and 23 foreign honorary 
members that composed the acade­
my’s 227th class of fellows. Among 
this year’s inductees were former 
Vice President Albert Gore Jr.; for­
mer Supreme Court Associate Justice 
Sandra Day O’Connor; New York City 
Mayor Michael Bloomberg; and film­
maker Spike Lee.
Criteria for induction into the acad­
emy include exemplary scholarship, ar­
tistic triumphs, and service to society.
All new members are nominated 
and elected by current members of the
academy. Members are divided into 
five basic categories: mathematics and 
physical sciences; biological sciences; 
social sciences; humanities and the 
arts; and public affairs, business, and 
administration.
The academy is an independent re­
search center that conducts studies of 
current issues across several disciplines. 
Academy research focuses on science, 
technology, global security, social 
policy in U.S. institutions, humanities, 
cultural studies, and education. Some 
of the academy’s current ongoing proj­
ects include subjects such as the state 
of the humanities, the independence 
of the American judicial system, the 
future of the Internet, the prolifera­
tion of nuclear weapons, the future 
of mass media, and feasible universal 
education.
H&SS unveils new gen ed website
The College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences (H&SS) has unveiled a revamped 
website detailing the general education 
(gen ed) requirements for H&SS stu­
dents. The website includes an outline of 
the requirements, a listing of the courses 
that satisfy one or more gen ed require­
ments that are searchable by department 
or gen ed category, and other features.
The goals of the website are to elimi­
nate confusion between the listed 
courses that satisfy requirements and 
the actual courses offered each semes­
ter; to streamline information that 
students were receiving from advisors 
about fulfilling gen ed requirements; and 
to increase the accessibility of informa­
tion about gen eds.
“While the gen ed program has 
enormous potential for making students’ 
coursework more varied and interesting
— given the range of courses and flex­
ibility in taking them — it was still being 
used in the ‘get it over with’ tradition of 
too many gen ed programs,” said Kristina 
Straub, associate dean of H&SS and 
member of the H&SS General Education 
Committee. “We wanted a way to help 
students use the gen ed to allow them to 
explore new ideas and to expand on or 
complement their major areas of study.” 
The committee hopes that H&SS stu­
dents will use the website to design 
general education programs that excite 
them. In addition, they believe that in­
creased access to lists of courses with 
space for non-majors will draw more 
students from other colleges into H&SS 
courses.

now.” If an event could instill 
that feeling in a student, he said, 
then Ahmadinejad’s speech was 
successful.
“That’s exactly what a presi­
dent should hope for, and what 
a university should do, and I ap­
plaud that,” Cohon said.
Jarrett Adams, a first-year 
information systems major, 
had mixed feelings about the 
speech.
“I thought the speech, over­
all, was rather insulting in a 
demeaning way,” he said. But, 
he said, that doesn’t mean the 
speaker should be barred from 
campus.
“I probably would want him to 
come here, if the offer were to be 
presented because it is contro­
versial, and controversy sparks 
the intellect,” he said.
Columbia’s situation is remi­
niscent of an incident that oc­
curred at Carnegie Mellon in 
spring 2005, when Malik Zulu 
Shabazz, national chairman of 
the New Black Panther Party for 
Self-Defense, came to speak.
“He came with a group of peo­
ple who turned out to be armed 
with clubs. Some of what he 
said could be characterized as 
hate speech — barely related to 
what he claimed he would talk 
about, [which was] the impor­
tance of blacks pursuing higher 
education and why that was so

tions about policies
SPEAKER, from Alimportant. His speech was a rant 
against gays, Jews, and whites. 
He managed to offend just about 
everyone you could think of,” 
Cohon recalled.
After the incident, the admin­
istration called for a review of 
the university’s Controversial 
Speakers Policy. A new version 
went into effect in February 
2007, but still maintained its 
core mission — promoting free 
expression.
Cohon said that, even under 
the revised policy, Ahmadine- 
jad would have been allowed on 
campus.
“He would have been allowed 
to speak. And I think if students 
were allowed to ask questions
— that would clinch it,” he said. 
“[But] if we knew in advance 
that the speaker was coming to 
deliver a hate speech and that 
that created a risk or danger to 
the campus, those would be cir­
cumstances in which a speaker 
would be barred from address­
ing the CMU community.”
Madsen, too, supports Car­
negie Mellon’s open but safe 
policy.
“A university has a mission to 
share knowledge, to investigate 
knowledge, to discuss issues,” 
he said. “One of our main values 
is to acquire knowledge. Close- 
minded attempts of gaining a 
diversity of knowledge will not 
be successful. University really 
means diversity.”
a history of unfair treatment.
For Muhammed Shodeinde, a 
sophomore in chemical engineer­
ing and SPIRIT member, raising 
awareness of the injustice faced 
by the Jena 6 was enough for him 
to participate in the walk-out.
“I felt that people needed to 
know that we students are aware 
of what’s going on and that we do 
care,” Shodeinde said.
When the mass arrived at the 
District Attorney’s Office, com­
munity activists and members of 
the crowd shared their views.
“[The atmosphere at the 
courthouse] was really 
powerful because you don’t see 
students come together like 
that,” Young said. “I learned a 
lot and met a lot of people, but
I felt like I knew them already 
because we were all united for 
one cause.”
The Jena 6 — Mychal Bell, 
Robert Bailey Jr., Carwin Jones, 
Bryant Purvis, Theo Shaw and 
Jesse Ray Beard — were be­
tween the ages of 14 and 16 at 
the time of the incident, but 
were charged as adults with at­
tempted murder and conspiracy 
to commit murder after a fight 
with Justin Barker, a white 
student in the small, predomi­
nantly white town of Jena, La. 
The legal adult age in Louisiana 
is 17.
Although the charges of Bell, 
Bailey, Jones, and Shaw were
later reduced to aggravated 
battery, critics agreed that the 
students should be tried as 
juveniles.
Purvis has not been ar­
raigned, and Beard’s charges 
are not available, since he was 
14 on the date of the fight.
In June 2007, Bell was the first 
to be convicted of aggravated 
battery as an adult, a charge 
that could have sent him to 
prison for up to 22 years.
The Revs. Jesse Jackson and Al 
Sharpton called for a rally Sept. 
20, the day of Bell’s sentencing. 
Between 15,000 and 20,000 
protesters swarmed Jena that 
day, according to CNN. Bell’s 
adult charges were dropped; on 
Sept. 27, he was released by a 
juvenile court at $45,000 bond, 
down from the $90,000 bail set 
by Judge J.P. Mauffray Jr. Bell 
still has to be tried in a juvenile 
court; the other five students 
are awaiting trial.
Protesters demanded that 
all charges be dropped against 
the Jena 6; that the U.S. Depart­
ment of Justice investigate the 
teens’ arrests; that Mauffray be 
dismissed from Bell’s juvenile 
case; that Mauffray and LaSalle 
Parish District Attorney Reed 
Walters be investigated for un­
ethical conduct; that the Jena 
school district superintendent 
be removed from office; and 
that all U.S. justice systems 
stop racial profiling of African- 
Americans.

The first weekend in Septem­
ber was notable for most students 
as it was the end of the first week 
of classes. For a small percentage 
of the student body population, it 
was the weekend that their social 
security numbers left campus, 
stored in the unencrypted files of 
two stolen laptop computers.
According to University Police 
reports filed on Sept. 2, the lap­
tops were stolen from the office 
of a computer science professor in 
Wean Hall. The door is believed 
to have been locked and there 
were no signs of forced entry, ac­
cording to case officer Lieutenant 
John Race of the Carnegie Mellon 
University Police.
A supplemental report filed on 
Sept. 7 concluded that although 
the professor typically set the 
door to lock automatically when 
pulled closed, the locking mecha­
nism may have been accidentally 
switched off at some point during 
the previous day. At the time of 
the theft, there were five comput­
ers present in the room, but only 
two were stolen, both of which 
were believed to have “contained 
significant personal identifying 
data,” according to the Sept. 7 
report.
Race, as well as members of 
the Information Security Office 
(ISO), believe that the laptops 
were stolen because of their 
commercial value, not for the 
information contained in their 
hard drives.
Cases of identity theft are ex­
tremely rare on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, Race said.
Laptops which are stolen are 
typically sold on the streets to 
some “private citizen who thinks 
they got a good deal,” he said.
Students whose social security 
numbers were stored on the sto­
len computers were informed of 
the theft on the weekend of Sept.
29. The e-mail provided students 
with general information about 
the theft as well as a website ad­
dress through which they could 
set up a Fraud Alert system on 
their banking and credit accounts 
which would notify them of any 
suspicious credit patterns in the
future. Further protective action 
was left to the discretion of the 
individual student.
One student, who preferred to 
remain anonymous for this arti­
cle, was concerned that students 
were not notified of the theft until 
almost a month after it occurred. 
He asked Carnegie Mellon to pay 
for a credit monitoring service, 
which would examine past credit 
history to determine if fraud had 
already occurred. The university 
refused, he said.
Because of incidents like this, 
administrators have already be­
gun to reduce the use of social 
security numbers in campus files. 
Since January 2006, students’ 
social security numbers have no 
longer appeared on course files.
However, according to Mary 
Ann Blair, director of the ISO, 
this transition in the usage of so­
cial security numbers was part of 
the reason for the slow communi­
cation of the incident to affected 
students.
Blair and her staff concluded 
that students enrolled in courses 
taught by the faculty member be­
tween summer 2004 and spring
2006 could be affected. With the 
help of Enrollment Services, the 
ISO staff compiled a list of the 
contact information for each stu­
dent left on the list.
Currently, the ISO is working 
to create a more secure network 
that will protect students’ iden­
tifying information, even in the 
case of another laptop theft. Last 
month, the university purchased 
“Identity Finder,” a system which 
allows individuals to scan their 
hard drives and then encrypt, de 
lete, or quarantine a file which is 
shown to contain personal infor­
mation, such as a social security 
number.
According to Race, it is ex­
tremely unlikely that the laptops 
will be recovered. However, no 
suspicious activity has been re 
ported on any of the affected 
students’ accounts.
“CMU needs to'take responsi 
bility” for the current theft, the 
previously referenced student 
said, and make sure that those 
affected receive the support that 
they need in order to protect 
their most important possession
— their identity.
Bush signs bill to increase student aid
by Mariluz Orbay
Junior Staffwriter
“I have the honor of signing 
a bill that will help millions of 
low-income Americans earn a 
college degree,” said President 
George W. Bush, surrounded 
by students and lawmakers on 
Sept. 27 while he signed the Col­
lege Cost Reduction and Access 
Act, a bill to make college more 
affordable for students from low 
and middle-class families.
The bill raises the maximum 
Pell Grant, an educational fed­
eral grant which requires high 
levels of need, from $4310 to 
$5400 over five years. The bill 
also and will reduce federal stu­
dent loan interest rates from 6.8 
percent to 3.4 percent over four 
years.
Moreover, the bill will limit 
the amount of money a borrower 
needs to repay to 15 percent of 
the borrower’s discretionary in­
come when they earn under 1.5 
times the poverty line.
Having originally threatened 
to veto the bill, on the grounds 
that “it included hidden costs 
and was an expensive expansion
of federal programs,” according 
to a Sept. 28 article in the Michi­
gan Daily, the President was 
forced to patronize it due to 
overwhelming Congress sup­
port, with a vote of 79-12 in the 
Senate and 292-97 in the House 
of Representatives, rendering 
the veto virtually ineffective.
Bush voiced his objections to 
the bill at the ceremony, which 
chiefly concerned how the 
increase in funds will be accom­
modated in the federal budget.
“This bill makes some spend­
ing commitments that aren’t paid 
for yet,” he said. “I look forward 
to working with the Congress to 
ensure Pell Grant increases that 
are not fully funded in this bill 
are paid for with offsets in other 
areas.”
It is important that students 
understand the large-scale im­
plications of such a bill.
“A federal government work­
ing to increase possibilities for a 
greater part of the population to 
gain a formal education degree is 
a great step forward into becom­
ing a more aware and productive 
nation,” said Kevan Tavalosi, a 
first-year finance major.
The bill was finally approved
after two failed attempts this 
summer to pass the necessary 
legislation to increase financial 
aid, which the President and 
some student loan companies 
strongly opposed.
“The new law will take away 
80 percent of the companies’ 
federal subsidies over the next 
five years,” said Kevin Bruns, 
executive director of America’s 
Student Loan Providers. Conse­
quently, he said, this will mean 
fewer loan benefits for students.
However, despite these pos­
sible setbacks, the signing of the 
bill means that aiding disadvan­
taged students, one of Bush’s 
original priorities, is now more 
of a possibility.
Linda Anderson, director of 
Enrollment Services at Carnegie 
Mellon, believes the bill will 
have a positive impact.
“For next year and the year to 
follow, the $490 increase will 
result in increased awards for 
our students here at Carnegie 
Mellon and across the nation, 
which is good; the interest rate 
reductions will undoubtedly 
also help,” Anderson said.
“However, the other side 
of the coin holds a greater
challenge for students and 
parents to determine their bor­
rowed benefits, because these 
will be in constant fluctuation 
throughout the year. You wil] 
see smaller lenders have severe 
competition, which will result 
in extreme challenges for them, 
and the possibility of unprofit­
ability.”
At the ceremony, Bush also 
drew awareness to an aspect of 
the bill that he liked — new flex­
ibility on college-loan payments 
for military personnel on active 
duty.
He congratulated the Demo­
cratic chairman of the House 
Education Committee, George 
Miller (D-Calif.), for working 
with him on it.
Students applauded the Presi­
dent’s flexibility on the issue.
“It seems as if Bush is begin­
ning to compromise with the 
Democrats and take actions that 
are less conservative,” said Vi- 
dhi Luthra, a first-year business 
and finance major.
“This bill gives more under­
privileged kids an opportunity 
to do something with their lives
— and that, on its basic terms, 
deserves to be applauded.”

juice and water for 15 days, con­
tinued to be passionate about 
the hunger strike throughout 
the month. She said she really 
enjoyed the experience and says 
the results are better than she 
had expected.
Local business owners were 
less enthusiastic about the pro­
test.
“They have to do their cause 
whether or not it affects people, 
that’s the way it goes,” said Jason 
Mager, manager of the Qdoba 
Mexican Grill next to the recruit­
ment station.
He said at the beginning of the 
month protesters blocked the 
floor in front of his store, deter­
ring customers, but toward the 
end, they kept to the front of 
Kinko’s. Mager did stress that his 
business lost somewhere from 
$15,000 to $30,000, which he at­
tributes to obstruction due to the 
protest.
The recruitment office was 
fairly uninvolved with the pro­
testers on a day-to-day basis. 
Dale Terry, chief of advertising 
and public affairs in the Pitts­
burgh recruiting battalion, was 
interviewed by the Pittsburgh 
City Paper.
“We have a wonderful Army 
doing a lot of things to keep the 
nation safe,” Terry said, in an Au­
gust 9 article in the Pittsburgh 
City Paper. Hindering recruiting 
hinders the nation, Terry said.
He suggested writing to local 
congressional representatives 
instead.
Protesters also ran into trou­
ble with local police. Many got 
citations because they were ob­
structing sidewalks and other 
public areas.
“Regardless of what police try 
to say, [the sidewalk] is a public 
space. We should be able to use 
it,” said Ryan Williams, a POG 
member.
Police often have difficulty try­
ing to reconcile the competing 
interests of businesses, pedestri­
ans, and protesters, city attorney 
Michael Kennedy said in a Sept. 
20 article in the Pittsburgh Post- 
Gazette.
After a court battle, the pro­
testers, represented by the 
American Civil Liberties Unior 
(ACLU) reached an agreemeni 
with the City of Pittsburgh ir 
which the city would give the 
group two different areas along 
Forbes Avenue in which the) 
could protest until Sept. 30.
Though this particular ven 
ture is over, the POG has more 
plans in store. The fast was onl) 
a small part of a two-year-long 
counter-recruitment campaign.
“People in Pittsburgh are read)

A potential new treatment for cog­
nitive impairments in schizophrenia 
may put an end to the suffering of pa­
tients diagnosed with this psychiatric 
disorder.
A recent study by Pitt researchers 
investigates the activation of a special 
type of neurotransmitter receptor called 
the glutamate receptor. Researchers 
suspect that by changing this receptor, 
chemical reactions in the brain can be 
carried out normally.
Positive symptoms of schizophrenia 
include hallucination and excessively 
peculiar behavior. Negative symptoms 
refer to the absence of normal behav­
ior, such as disregard towards personal 
care and social withdrawal.
According to a news release, cogni­
tive symptoms, which are the focal 
point of this study, are associated with 
“the inability to function socially and at 
work, due to impairments in attention, 
memory, and problem-solving.” 
Schizophrenia usually attacks young 
individuals who are at the onset of 
adulthood. Studies in the past have 
shown that schizophrenia is a treatable

Online game teaches users about the threats of phishing
by Jun Xian Leong
Staffwriter
Researchers from the Carnegie 
Mellon Usable Privacy and Se­
curity (CUPS) Laboratory have 
recently released the first field test 
for Anti-Phishing Phil (APP), an 
online game that teaches users to 
identify dangerous websites and 
practice safer Internet surfing.
Phishing is a term used to de­
scribe criminal websites that 
pretend to be other, legitimate
Michael Whiston
With over a century since its 
debut in scientific literature, time 
travel may be more of an every­
day reality than most people 
think.
By definition, time dilation is 
the difference in time measure­
ment between two observers, 
where one moves with respect to 
the other. Time dilation has been 
experimentally proven.
Albert Einstein was the first 
scientist to claim that time runs 
at different rates depending on 
the relative velocity between 
two observers. In 1905, Einstein 
published a paper titled The Elec­
trodynamics of Moving Bodies in 
which he put forth his “Special 
Theory of Relativity.”
According to this theory, the 
speed of light and the form of 
physical laws are the same for 
all non-accelerating observers. 
In other words, the speed of light 
and the relationship between 
force, mass, and acceleration are 
the same for all observers moving 
at constant velocity.
However, the only way this can 
happen is if an observer’s space 
and the time measurements of 
a system depend on the system’s 
velocity relative to that observer. 
This means that two observers 
can measure the time interval 
between the same two events 
and come up with different time 
measurements for these events, 
as long as one of the observers is 
moving at constant velocity with 
respect to the other.
To understand time dilation at 
a more technical level, one must 
first understand the concept of 
a reference frame. A reference 
frame is an imaginary coordinate 
system that specifies the loca­
tion and time measurements of 
events with respect to a fixed ori­
gin. It can also be thought of as an 
' maginary map.
websites, such as eBay or PayPal, 
in order to obtain people’s per­
sonal information.
Possession of this information 
could lead to further criminal ac­
tivity.
A “phisher,” for instance, might 
set up a website that looks like the 
website of the Bank of America to 
trick visitors into entering their 
bank account numbers and pins.
The phisher could then use this 
information to access the visitor’s 
bank account and steal funds.
Phishing is often a precursor to
other, more damaging crimes, in­
cluding identity theft and fraud.
APP was created specifically 
to help combat this new wave of 
crime.
APP is an interactive game 
that teaches players to recognize 
common methods of phishing by 
putting the player in control of a 
fish named Phil, who must pick 
wisely between several worms 
floating in the sea.
Each worm is attached to a 
website URL, and picking web­
sites that are actually “phishes”
causes players to be “hooked” and 
lose the game.
According to “Anti-Phishing 
Phil: The Design and Evaluation 
of a Game That Teaches People 
Not to Fall for Phish,” the project 
design paper published in July, 
APP primarily teaches players to 
recognize false IP address URLs.
This is done through a series of 
interactive tutorials between and 
during the quizzes.
“We wanted to find a way to 
educate people about the com­
mon methods of phishing online
as well as their dangers,” said as­
sociate research professor Lome 
Cranor, advisor of the project.
“We found that no one really 
reads security warnings, and we 
needed to find a way to make the 
public more aware of phishing,” 
she said.
According to Kami Vaniea, one 
of Cranor’s graduate students, 
APP promises to be an effective 
way to educate people concerning 
the dangers of phishing due to its
See PHISHING, page A5
How Things Work: Time Dilation
In space-time physics, every 
person (or observer) has his 
or her own reference frame in 
which he or she is the origin. 
Thus, in space-time physics, a 
person assigns spatial and time 
coordinates to events based on 
his or her position.
Having now defined refer­
ence frame, time dilation can be 
thought of as the difference be­
tween time measurements of two 
reference frames that are moving 
at different velocities with re­
spect to one another.
Another way to think of time 
l^Hon is in terms of flight.
When two people synchronize 
their clocks to read the same 
time, this synchrony remains as 
long as the two people remain at 
rest with respect to one another. 
However, if one person boards an 
airplane and flies a certain dis­
tance, that person’s clock will run 
at a slower rate than the person 
on the ground.
Researchers used this same 
scenario in the 1970s to test Ein­
stein’s theory of time dilation. 
In this experiment, they used 
atomic clocks, which are very 
accurate clocks that can measure 
time to ^illionths of a second. One
Elizabeth Liu/Art Staff
clock remained on the ground, 
and the other clock flew on a jet at 
600 miles per hour. As predicted 
by Einstein’s Special Theory of 
Relativity, the clocks ran at dif­
ferent rates. The airplane clock 
ran billionths of a second slower 
than the ground clock.
Time dilation also occurs in 
the detection of muons. Muons 
are particles created in the at­
mosphere by cosmic rays. They 
fall constantly down to Earth at 
around 200,000 miles per sec­
ond. The muons decay as they 
fall, and scientists are able to pre­
dict how many muofts will decay
after a certain amount of time 
has passed in the laboratory (or 
Earth) reference frame.
However, because muons 
move so quickly with respect to 
the laboratory reference frame, 
time passes slower in the muon 
reference frame than in the labo­
ratory rest frame. Thus, more 
muons survive than predicted in 
the laboratory reference frame 
according to this frame’s clock.
The physical explanation for 
time dilation is still under re­
search, but it has been proposed 
that particle physics is the reason 
for time dilation.
The Basic Particle Model says 
that every particle consists of 
smaller particles that orbit each 
other at the speed of light. That 
is, each of these particles has an 
“orbital speed” that equals the 
speed of light.
According to Einstein’s Special 
Theory of Relativity, the speed of 
light remains constant in all refer­
ence frames. Consequently, when 
a particle moves horizontally, the 
total speed of the constituent 
particles with respect to the rest 
frame is still equal to the speed of 
light. The difference, though, is 
that when the particle is moving 
horizontally, the total speed of 
the particle is made up of “orbital 
speed” and “horizontal speed” 
components, rather than just an 
orbital speed component as is the 
case when the particle is at rest.
This leads to the orbiting par­
ticles having a longer period with 
respect to the rest frame. The pe­
riod is the amount of time that it 
takes one of the particles to com­
plete one full orbit.
The time difference between 
the two reference frames is equal 
to “gamma,” or the Lorentz factor. 
The Lorentz factor is a mathemat­
ical expression that accounts for 
the relative velocity between the 
reference frames and the speed 
of light. \

La Niña to bring 
warm temperatures
According to WSI forecaster 
Todd Crawford, people in Pitts­
burgh and the rest of the eastern 
U.S. can expect warm weather 
this winter.
The reason for a warmer 
winter is due to “La Niña,” the 
occurrence of low temperatures 
in the equatorial Pacific.
According to Mike Halpert, 
the head of forecast operations 
at the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration’s 
Climate Prediction Center, this 
winter will be “a lot like last 
year, but the climate models are 
even more in agreement now 
than they were last fall.”
Warmer weather this winter 
could cut down on residents’ oil 
costs, which are currently high 
due to oil trading above $80 a 
barrel.

Sensor helps 
athletes, patients
By attaching a sensor behind 
a person’s ear, doctors and ath­
letic trainers can monitor an 
individual’s body movements.
Researchers at Imperial Col­
lege London created this sensor 
to track the position of a per­
son’s body based on data from 
an accelerometer. An acceler­
ometer is a device that measures 
a person’s change in velocity. 
The accelerometer determines 
the body’s movement based on 
shock waves that travel through 
the person’s body.
After recording data, the sen­
sor sends information wirelessly 
to a computer. This information 
can be used to track the body 
movements of patients who are 
recovering from surgery or ath­
letes who wish to improve their 
performance.
The sensor may enter large- 
scale production in the next 
year.

“This is a much more engag­
ing method of educating people 
compared to giving them a thick 
manual to pore through,” Vaniea 
skid.
Vaniea said that one of the 
websites that tricked many peo­
ple during trials of the game was 
one that was well designed and 
professional-looking.
“Everyone thought it was real, 
despite there being many other 
signs that it was really a phish,” 
she said, adding that APP will 
help train people to look beyond 
appearances and be more alert 
to subtle threats of phishing. 
‘There’s a difference between 
brand identification in real life 
and websites.”
¦ The paper also presents statis­
tics that suggest that interactive 
games such as APP can be a prom­
ising way of educating people 
about phishing.
Although several prominent 
companies, including Google and 
AOL, have taken steps to help 
combat this phenomenon, phish­
ing remains a major threat to the 
security of Internet users.
According to the Business Com­
munications Review magazine, 
losses worldwide due to phish­
ing have been estimated to be 
between $400 million and $1.2 
billion yearly.
Based on preliminary tests, 
APP has been receiving consistent 
attention. Upward of 100 people 
daily tested out APP during the 
early trial period, said Steve 
Sheng, the Ph.D. student who de­
veloped the game.
The study group also found a 
notable increase in anti-phishing 
knowledge among testers who 
played the game.
APP is currently in the field
study stage, although plans for its 
commercial release are already in 
the works.
“We were really surprised, but 
within a week of putting it online, 
we’ve been contacted by a dozen 
different companies interested 
in leasing it for commercial pur­
poses,” Cranor said.
Most of the offers were inter­
ested in using it as a method of 
employee training, Cranor said, 
but no deals have been finalized 
as of yet.
The CUPS laboratory is also 
currently working on several 
other methods to combat phish­
ing, including embedded training, 
CANTINA (Carnegie Mellon 
ANTI-phishing and Network 
Analysis tool) and Phishguru. 
Phishguru is a method of training 
that teaches users about phishing

TREATMENT, from A4
neurotransmitter glutamate in 
a way that chemical reactions 
in the prefrontal cortex can be 
‘normalized.”
This means that the chemical 
levels that have reached an abnor­
mal degree during schizophrenia 
can be stabilized.
The abnormalities in the 
prefrontal cortex that trigger 
schizophrenia can be regu­
larized in two steps. First, 
researchers must prevent the 
NMDA subtype of the glutamate 
receptor from being activated. 
Second, researchers must acti­
vate a different type of glutamate 
receptor called the metabotropic 
glutamate 5 receptor (mGluR5), 
by using the drug 3-cyano-N- 
(l,3-diphenyl-lH-pyrazol-5-yl), 
?rCDPPB.
Moghaddam said, “It is the 
cortical cells which are actually 
responsible for the abnormality 
in the prefrontal cortex that leads 
to schizophrenia. Our hypothesis 
proposes that the interaction be­
tween different regions of the 
brain is largely dependent on glu­
tamate, which acts as a chemical 
messenger.
“The normalization in the pre­
frontal cortex, which is home 
to the cognitive impairments in 
schizophrenia, is a promising 
therapeutic solution.”
Current treatment for schizp- 
phrenia, which involves blocking 
the neurotransmitter dopamine 
by blocking the dopamine recep­
tors, not only “generates harmful 
side effects such as diabetes, 
weight gain, and dysphoria, but 
profoundly affects motor move­
ment, which may even trigger 
the onset of Parkinson’s disease,” 
Moghaddam said.
Related experiments have 
shown positive results in rats. The 
researchers believe that as it has 
exhibited in these smaller mam­
mals, their treatment may reflect 
improvement in humans affected 
by schizophrenia.
John H. Krystal, who is Edi­
tor of Biological Psychiatry and 
affiliated with Yale University 
School of Medicine and the VA 
Connecticut Healthcare System, 
stated in a news release, “These 
exciting new data provide impor­
tant new evidence supporting the 
testing of mGluR5-stimulating 
medications for the treatment of 
schizophrenia, particularly cog-
nitive deficits associated with im­
pairments in the function of the 
. prefrontal cortex.
“It would be very interest­
ing to know whether this 
class of medication reduces 
the transient impairments in 
cognitive function associated 
with the administration of NMDA 
receptor blockers to humans.”
While the authors of this 
study intend to perform tests 
on the clinical implications of 
their hypothesis, they back its 
significance due to the visible reg­
ulation of cognitive deficits in the 
prefrontal cortex of rats caused 
by the activation of mGluRS.
“It shows that in an awake, 
behaving mammal (as opposed 
to in tissue cultures or similar 
preparations), activation of these 
receptors has a normalizing ef­
fect on the spontaneous activity 
of prefrontal cortex neurons,” 
Moghaddam said in a news re­
lease.
The results of this new study 
not only provide hope to suffer­
ing patients of schizophrenia, but 
they also suggest a cure which is 
free from adverse affects and can 
be implemented from the early 
onset of the disease.

Trapped in Pittsburgh
US Airways makes cuts to direct flight services out of Pittsburgh International Airport
We hope you didn’t really enjoy having 
US Airways in your life.
This past week, Pittsburgh’s larg­
est carrier announced another round 
of cuts to its service out of Pittsburgh. 
This means that, in January, the number 
of daily flights leaving town will drop 
from 108 to 68. Places you may have 
wanted to go and no longer can include: 
Nashville, Denver, Erie, Chicago, Nor­
folk, Louisville, and Toronto.
But really this is part of a larger 
trend for US Airways, which shortly be­
fore 9/11 had over 500 flights leaving 
Pittsburgh each day. In 2004, Pittsburgh 
International Airport was downgraded 
from a hub to a “focus city” — which in 
airport lingo means they don’t love us
anymore — and just this past May, US 
Airways cut direct flights to Baltimore, 
San Diego, Buffalo, and Seattle.
The positive side to all of this is as 
US Airways withdraws, other airlines 
may increase service like Southwest 
and JetBlue have done. This should, in 
theory, increase the market efficiency 
and lower prices for those of us who 
want to get out of the city for a bit.
While the county remains hopeful that 
other airlines will step up, US Airways 
has decided to only renew its contracts 
on 10 gates at Pittsburgh International 
Airport, leaving 18 empty. The airport 
will likely shut down these gates in an 
effort to save money, at least until other 
companies increase service as airport
officials hope will happen. Officials are 
currently claiming that these cuts will 
not affect travelers.
But with 18 gates closed, we can 
imagine the airport starting to feel de­
serted. We imagine a future with tum­
bleweed blowing down the moving side­
walks and the TGI Friday’s becoming 
that kind of old-style saloon where there 
are only two old guys drinking at the 
bar who look at you funny as you walk 
in. The best deals to fly home for break 
will include driving out to Cleveland to 
catch a decent flight. Or, possibly, we 
will simply all remain in Pittsburgh, 
trapped beside our three rivers, trying 
to figure out why the airplanes no longer, 
stop here.
Locked out and broke
Housing and Dining Services announces increased fees for lockouts and new ID cards
Last week, Housing and Dining 
Services announced that it would be 
charging students for lock-outs by in­
creasing $5 increments after an initial 
free first lockout, and the price of re­
placement ID cards from $15 to $25.
Because Housing and Dining offi­
cials didn’t specify why the change was 
necessary in their memo to students, it 
seems that they would use the money 
to make up the costs of replacing lost 
keys and cards. Their website, however, 
states that all funding will be allocated 
to Safewalk, a program that provides 
late-night escorts to walk students to 
residence halls from places on campus.
Safewalk is, admittedly, a good
program to have, but it is unfair to 
slap increasingly severe punishments 
on students for accidentally locking 
themselves out. When we lose our IDs 
or get locked out, we are already incon­
venienced by the loss of our meal plans, 
bank accounts, ID numbers, and access 
to campus facilities — we don’t need 
the added burden of increasingly large 
fines.
In addition, Safewalk does not seem 
the best use of the funds accrued from 
this penalty. If Housing and Dining in­
sists on fining students, the money could 
be used more effectively to increase the 
number of emergency call boxes (which 
offer 24-hour safety), add lighting to
dark areas of campus, or make facility 
improvements to residential buildings.
Perhaps more directly, the money 
could feed into improving the print­
ing of cards. Currently, the faces of ID 
cards wear off quickly. Higher-quality 
printing could save some money in the 
long run by decreasing the number of re­
placement cards the university provides 
to students for free.
Safewalk only operates between 10 
p.m. and 2 a.m., and is only really useful 
for students who live on campus. If we’re 
going to be charged more for lockouts 
and ID cards, the money should be used 
for improvements that affect the entire 
campus community.
Alcohol may become even more expensive
Pennsylvania’s Quaker roots have al­
ways made purchasing alcohol a chore. 
There is no alcohol in grocery stores, beer 
and liquor are sold in separate stores, 
and the taxes on alcohol are among the 
highest in the world. The Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board subjects alcohol to 
a 30 percent markup tax, a $1.30 bottle 
charge, an 18 percent Johnstown flood 
tax, a “round up” tax, and a 7 percent 
state sales tax.
Now, Dan Onorato is proposing an 
additional alcohol tax — a 10 percent 
poured alcohol tax — throughout Al­
legheny County in an effort to make 
up for the deficit affecting Pittsburgh’s 
public transit. His proposal would yield
between $35 and $50 million, which 
covers the amount needed to keep state 
funding' for public transportation sev­
eral times over.
The price of the new poured alcohol 
tax would essentially be a double­
whammy for students, but it confuses 
the supply/demand audience outside of 
campus as well: The people who are pur­
chasing poured drinks are not the same 
people riding the buses. The affected 
group does not align with the potentially 
rewarded group, and that’s a problem.
This new alcohol tax will cost us, and 
it just doesn’t make sense. The Port Au­
thority of Allegheny County is already 
doubling the amount Carnegie Mellon
and Pitt will pay for student bus passes; 
Carnegie Mellon’s total cost will peak 
at $1.5 million over the next five years, 
and these costs will be reflected in our 
fee payments.
Furthermore, the raised cost of alco­
hol will push the social act of drinking 
outside Allegheny County, a counter­
intuitive move for a city claiming to be 
actively fighting the brain drain.
Imposing a 10 percent poured alco­
hol tax seems like a dementedly noble, 
Robin Hood-like attempt at saving the 
public transportation in Pittsburgh. The 
Port Authority needs saving, but the pro­
posed tax on poured alcohol is far from a 
sustainable solution.
Shepard bill targets hate crimes
Shawn Wertz
It was a cold night in October 1998 
when Aaron McKinney and Russell Hen­
derson offered University of Wyoming 
student Matthew Shepard a ride home 
from a bar in Laramie, Wyo. Matthew 
never made it home. McKinney and 
Henderson bound Shepard to a fence, 
pistol-whipped him, and left him for 
dead — all because Matthew was- gay.
I was 12 at the time, and unaware of 
what being “gay” meant. But as time 
passed, I realized more how Shepard’s 
beating would be the defining moment 
in causing the country to examine its 
hatred for those outside the norm.
Almost nine years later, I look at Shep­
ard’s beating through the eyes of a con­
fident and self-aware gay male. I’m not 
ashamed of who I am, but every time I 
pass a group of rowdy heterosexual 
males after a long night of studying on 
campus I can’t help but wonder — will 
it happen to me? Will I be the victim of 
violence, simply because I am gay?
The Senate officially passed the Mat­
thew Shepard Act on Sept. 27, a hate- 
crimes bill that would expand the defi­
nition of a hate crime to include crimes 
committed against those targeted for 
their sexual orientation.
Current hate-crime laws limit the def­
inition of a hate crime to those acts com­
mitted due to bias against a particular 
race or religion.
Though the House and the Senate 
both passed the bill, it still must go 
through President Bush’s hands. The 
White House has issued no formal state­
ment, but Bush previously said that he 
would veto any such legislation. Others 
have questioned the necessity of the bill. 
Chicago Tribune columnist Steve Chap­
man wrote, “murder is against the law,
even in Wyoming, and ... Shepard’s at­
tackers are now serving sentences that 
would not be any longer if this law had 
been in effect then.”
Chapman felt that, when it comes 
down to it, murder is simply murder.
What individuals like Chapman fail to 
see is that there is a difference between 
murdering a random person and murder­
ing a person of a particular community 
as an act of intimidation towards other 
members of that community.
I remember when I first came out in 
high school. Someone had stolen my 
yearbook, and when I finally found it lay­
ing in a hallway, “faggot” and “You will 
burn in hell” were scribbled through­
out it. The culprits were caught and 
received a mere slap on the wrist. I felt 
bewildered, hated myself, hated other 
gay men, and hated the world. Had it 
not been for a very supportive family, I 
might still be living in a stagnant pool of 
self-hatred. Or worse, I might not be liv­
ing at all. And I’m not alone — accord­
ing to the Census Bureau, thousands 
across this country face the same type of 
intimidation, both in and out of school.
But regardless of age, coming into 
one’s sexual identity is a fragile time 
where intimidation and hatred can do 
their worst damage on an individual.
If President Bush vetoes the bill, two- 
thirds of the House and Senate will have 
to vote in favor of the bill to pass it again. 
I lost faith long ago in the President’s 
making the right decision. I can only 
hope that the House and Senate will rec­
ognize how important passing this bill 
is. Hopefully, in the future, it will deter 
members of our society from intimidat­
ing others who are different.
I will continue to hope that my chil­
dren will never have to face a moment 
where they are labeled because of what 
makes them different.

victims of hate crimes after law school.
New FCEs aren’t the right answer
Andrew Peters
The majority of students at Carnegie 
Mellon know FCEs to be detailed on­
line questionnaires. FCEs often seem a 
ponderous task toward the end of the 
semester, though many students enjoy 
the opportunity to give their profes­
sors feedback. The problem with online 
FCEs is that, left to complete FCEs on 
their own, students tend not to com­
plete them.
Last semester, in an effort to increase 
response rates, Faculty Senate voted to 
eliminate the detailed questionnaire. 
Their solution will look something like 
this: (1) On a scale of one to five, rate 
this course. (2) On a scale of one to five, 
rate your professor. (3) Please leave any 
comments you have about the course.
That’s right, the form will only include 
three questions for each course. Switch­
ing from a comprehensive rating system 
to a brief and open-ended form does not 
solve the real problem: the online form 
just can’t perform all of the functions it 
is asked to perform.
As it is, FCEs have many duties. They 
help students communicate among 
themselves about which courses are ef­
fective, help professors make changes 
to the course content, and inform the 
process of tenure and advancement. 
These are three hefty jobs for one little 
form to handle.
I understand the logic behind short­
ening the form in order to increase re­
sponse rates: decrease the amount of 
work and students are more likely to 
complete it. I doubt, however, that the 
new format will also bring about qual­
ity, thoughtful responses.
If professors want quality responses 
that they can use to change their
courses, they should (and some depart­
ments still do) administer hard-copy 
evaluations in class. According to En­
rollment Services, the average student 
spends about 10 minutes on an online 
FCE, so by taking up only a fraction of 
their class time, professors can meet or 
increase both the average amount of 
time spent on evaluations and the num­
ber of respondents.
The tenure process, which can decide, 
a professor’s future livelihood, should 
not depend on the responses gleaned 
from an online form. The amount of 
effort students put into completing the 
current online FCE forms is not propor­
tional to the weight that the forms are 
given in terms of evaluating professors 
for advancement. It’s not that students 
don’t care, because many really do, but 
it’s difficult to expend a lot of time on an 
evaluation during an extremely stress­
ful time of year.
Last, the new form will not allow 
students to comniunicate any relevant 
information to one another about the 
course. We won’t be able to see how stu­
dents rated a professor on their ability 
to give helpful feedback or how impor­
tant the course materials were. The only 
thing that will inform our decision is a 
number between one and five.
If we want quality decision-making 
to occur on the part of both students 
and faculty, we must tease out the vari­
ous functions of evaluation and find an 
effective way of administering each of 
them: for immediate feedback, in-class 
forms; for students, a separate, perhaps 
year-round system to make comments 
among themselves; and for the tenure 
process, a new form of student feedback 
instituted to obtain the most accurate 
and thoughtful commentary.
Andrew Peters (aepeters@) is a junior in 
ethics, history, and public policy. He wel­
comes all reasonable responses.

Tackling election 
inefficiencies so 
your vote counts
Sean Weinstock and Adi Jain
Hey Tartans. Welcome to the 
second Presidential Perspectives! 
We’re going to update you, the 
campus community, on our ac­
tivities. (That means there’s 
actually stuff to update you on!)
Over the past few weeks, we’ve 
been settling into informal dis­
cussions, meetings, and action 
plans that will shape the direc­
tion of the programs we hope to 
leave as our legacy. We’ve been 
eager to dig into the work, and 
the question that everyone seems 
to have is “What are you guys hit­
ting on first?” Our first point of 
business has nothing to do with 
the CMU 5, because we didn’t 
think it would be as pressing an 
issue as it became during the 
whole campaign process. “OH 
NO! They’re already pulling the 
political wiggle-jiggle dance!” 
Not really. We don’t flake.
We just have some larger 
issues to address first. Elections 
should run as smoothly as possi­
ble for several reasons, the most 
important of which is that we as 
constituents need faith in the sys­
tem that puts campus leadership 
in place. Without knowing that 
votes will count, why even raise 
your voice in the first place? We 
view it as our responsibility to 
fix the system to best suit every­
one’s needs. With help from our 
friends Vice President of Finance 
Joel Bergstein, Graduate Student 
Association President Beth Ayers, 
and Senate Chair Jared Itkowitz, 
we’re in the process of creating a 
committee composed equally of 
Graduate Student Assembly Rep­
resentatives and undergraduate 
Student Senators that will cover 
everything from whether online 
balloting is the best way to go to 
when voting should take place 
and what backup plans to have. 
Soon, we’ll have a feasible reso­
lution on how future elections 
will run.
As this is the time of year that 
many of us are interviewing for 
jobs or internships, I wanted 
to give you a little brainteaser 
closer this week:
Imagine yourself walking 
down a hallway to a first round, 
mentally prepared for the 
indecent badgering that lies 
ahead. When you reach the end 
of this hallway, you see two doors 
and a kindly older gentleman 
guarding them. There is a sign in 
front of the old man that reads: 
“Your first test from Company X 
is whether or not you can figure 
out which of these two doors 
leads to your interview. You are 
allowed one question that the 
kind, older gentleman standing 
here will answer. You’ll then pick 
one door to go through. You have 
to keep in mind, though, that this 
old man either lies all the time or 
always tells the truth.”
What do you ask him? (cmu5@

YouTube culture: The greatest thing since sliced bread
kstk'Vto»'
_________________Sarah Mogin
Whenever something truly 
great comes along, you have to 
wonder: Is it the greatest thing 
since sliced bread? Sliced bread is 
pretty awesome. You can toast it, 
you can make a sandwich out of 
it, and you can spread things on 
it: peanut butter, jelly, jam, and 
even Nutella (if you’re weird). 
But YouTtibe, I argue, offers just 
as much flexibility — and fewer 
calories.
Justice
Now, justice-related footage 
is nothing new (we all remem­
ber O.J.’s epic police chase in 
1994), but YouTube makes the 
information more accessible
— especially for us children of 
the ’80s and ’90s, known for 
our apathy. And there’s nothing 
like widespread bad publicity to 
encourage organizations to clean 
up their acts.
YouTube has hosted coundess 
videos of police brutality, 
uploaded from bystanders’ 
cameras or even camera phones.
Supported by video footage, 
suspects can legitimize their 
complaints against officers, 
evolving their disputes past the 
realm of he-said, she-said.
In November of 2006, the FBI 
started an investigation into the 
Los Angeles Police Department in 
response to a YouTube video that 
showed two officers punching a 
suspect, an alleged gang mem­
ber. That same month, another 
video emerged with footage of 
UCLA campus officers stunning 
a student with a Taser because 
he didn’t have an ID. Several 
weeks ago, the student filed a suit 
against UCLA, the campus police, 
and the two offending officers.
And video-inspired justice has 
even made it to the Pittsburgh 
area. As recently as last 
Wednesday, a WTAE-TV camera­
man shot footage of a Braddock 
police officer punching a suspect­
ed burglar. Braddock officials are 
currently probing the incident, 
and the video has already made 
its way to YouTube.
Politics
This summer’s CNN-YouTube 
debate pinned Democratic 
candidates against each other
on issues such as health care, 
education, and the environment, 
and the successes were twofold.
First, the candidates fielded 
real questions from real people, 
as submitted on YouTube, which 
helped to cut through the bullshit 
standard in political debates. It 
might be easy to tell Anderson 
Cooper, who hosted the show, 
your plans for health care in the 
U.S., but try telling the same to a 
real-life breast cancer survivor.
Second, the YouTube-infused 
format was entertaining and 
dynamic enough to appeal 
to young people, as many 
questioners used songs, puppets, 
props, and animals to empha­
size their points. More debates 
like this one and — who knows
— college students might even 
start voting. Look forward to the 
Republican debate, coming to 
CNN Nov. 28.
Education
A lot of people rolled their 
eyes when they first heard about 
Pitzer College’s course titled 
Learning From YouTube. In the 
class, students spend most of 
their time online, commenting 
on YouTube videos and occasion-
ally posting their own. According 
to an article from the Associated 
Press, media studies professor 
Alexandra Juhasz created the 
course to study the site’s impact 
on our culture.
Juhasz’s class is nothing if not 
progress, and those naysayers are 
probably the same people who 
think the Internet is a “fad” that 
will soon go out of style. Ideally, 
students will learn about the dif­
ferent facets of YouTube, who 
they affect, and why. Worst case 
scenario, the class turns out a 
joke, which isn’t exactly unheard 
of in the world of academia — 
Interpretation and Argument, 
anyone?
Entertainment
And now we come to per­
haps the most famous part of 
YouTube: the entertainment
factor. YouTube is a haven for 
homemade tours de force, both 
live-action and animated. These 
are risqué, subversive, absurd, or 
even pointless — way past what 
you’re likely to find on TV. To 
be sure, these are the Nutella of 
YouTube.
Additionally, YouTube videos 
often catch celebrities and other
icons at their worst. Not only 
are these entertaining, they 
also dispel what remains of the 
myth that celebrities are some­
how flawless, incapable of error. 
From YouTube, we learned that 
Beyonce can fall, Ashlee Simpson 
can get drunk at a McDonald’s, 
and Stephen Colbert can slip up 
and say “fuck” during his Report. 
And as for lower-profile flubs, 
we also saw that even runway 
models can trip in heels, news­
casters can laugh on the air, and 
Miss Teen South Carolina can be 
completely ignorant of interna­
tional affairs.

Fair trade coffee will come to campusonce vou ask for it
Jessica Thurston
Fair trade coffee partner­
ships foster openness and 
respect between consum­
ers and producers. By help­
ing out small-scale farmers in 
often underprivileged regions 
of the world, these partner­
ships cultivate equitability and 
transparency in trade. They are 
often coupled with organic food 
initiatives, a union that high­
lights the idea of more natu­
ral and sustainable living. Fair 
trade coffee, when supported by 
vendors and consumers, leads 
to everyone being increasingly 
knowledgeable of other cultures 
of the world.
So why, then, isn’t fair trade 
coffee more prevalent on 
Carnegie Mellon’s campus, a cam­
pus that celebrates sustainability 
and green practices?
Currently, fair trade coffee — 
and information about it—is rare 
at Carnegie Mellon. On a campus 
densely populated with regular 
coffee drinkers, there are nei­
ther enough coffee selections nor 
enough shared information about 
what we’re drinking.Besides the 
fact that coffee provides the caf­
feine high that many of us need 
to combat gray Pittsburgh days, 
the average campus community 
member does not know enough 
about where their $2 spent on 
coffee is going — and that needs 
to change.
Today, fair trade coffee is 
only regularly brewed at the La 
Prima Espresso venue inside 
the entrance to Wean Hall. La 
Prima is built on the idea of 
being “a valuable member of 
the local community through 
[its] employment practices and 
of the world community through 
[its] green coffee selection,” 
according to the company’s web­
site (www.laprima.com), and 
95 to 100 percent of the cof­
fee La Prima brews is fair trade. 
The coffee vendor “strongly 
believe [s] in investing in local
of fair trade coffee to be the 
fault of a too-removed, too-prof- 
it-hungry administrative force 
(as fair trade coffee can be more 
expensive than non-fair trade 
varieties), Ryan Rearick, assis­
tant director of Housing and 
Dining Services, explained the 
contrary.
Fair trade is “certainly some­
thing we’d look into ... if we 
received a groundswell of 
feedback,” he said. Bringing to 
mind Dining Services’ recent 
change to using cage-free eggs 
in all central dining locations 
on campus, Rearick emphasized 
the fact that the university 
wants to support movements 
underscoring principles of 
sustainability and humane treat­
ment.
Dining Services, Rearick 
stressed, does listen to students. 
But because he has only received 
three questions about fair 
trade coffee over his two years 
as assistant director, making 
it more prevalent on campus 
seems, at this point, an unlikely 
prospect. Fair trade coffee, he 
said, could be a “worthwhile 
investment of extra resources,” 
as was the decision to move to 
cage-free eggs. But this can only 
happen if students speak out. It 
is our responsibility to be mind­
ful of something many of us 
consume on a daily basis — and 
of where it comes from.
So e-mail Dining Services 
(dining@an drew, cmu.edu). 
Talk to vendors on campus. 
Ask for fair trade coffee. By 
asking for and investing just a 
few dollars in a product you’re 
purchasing anyway, you can 
make a difference that combats 
debt, labor shortage, and ris­
ing goods transportation costs 
faced by small-scale, local farm­
ers around the world.
Jessica Thurston (jthursto@J 
is really more of a tea person, 
but welcomes all recommenda­
tions of fair trade coffee roasts, 
and suggestions on how to inform 
you about making culturally 
conscious decisions.
businesses and local people,” and 
this tenet is made reality by bring­
ing small-scale, localized farm­
ers’ coffee to our local Carnegie 
Mellon community.
But La Prima’s emphasis 
on supporting fair trade cof­
fee is not publicized enough on 
campus. Most likely, the major­
ity of students are not stopping 
at La Prima because of their 
commitment to vending fair trade 
coffee; rather, they are stopping 
there in between classes, sports 
practices, and study sessions out 
of convenience.
This grab-and-go mentality 
pervades coffee consumption on 
campus. So while the Maggie 
Murph Café and the Carnegie 
Mellon Café do have the option 
of brewing Starbucks fair trade 
coffee alongside their regu-
lar Starbucks brews upon your 
request, it is unlikely that anyone 
will have the time to wait for the 
brewing process to happen — if 
they even know it is an option. It 
is not enough to just say fair trade 
coffee is available to be brewed; it 
should be regularly brewed and 
advertised everywhere coffee is 
sold on campus.
While it is highly commendable 
that La Prima is committed to 
selling fair trade coffee, and 
thus supporting small-scale 
producers worldwide, fair trade 
coffee practices should be under­
stood and celebrated by more 
than just vendors. Besides not 
being available at the Zebra 
Lounge or Entropy (according to 
Dining Services), fair trade cof­
fee information is unavailable to 
the campus community at large,
especially to the coffee drinker 
on the go.
So what can change? 
Pamphlets and signs detailing 
the significance of fair trade 
coffee partnerships should be 
prominently displayed anywhere 
coffee is sold. Fair trade certifica­
tion labels could be printed on 
cardboard coffee sleeves, under­
neath store name signs, or on 
stickers decorating cash registers. 
Information could also be added 
to Dining Services’ website. But 
who is responsible for making 
these moves, for getting the word 
out?
It is ultimately Dining Services’ 
responsibility to decide what 
vendors are on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, but their moves are 
influenced by campus opinion. 
While I initially expected the lack

Golf finishes second in Westminster Invitational
SPORTS COMMENTARY
The Rockies return 
to the postseason
Sam Kim
The Colorado Rockies 
surprised the MLB faithful 
by winning the wild card in 
the National League (NL) to 
advance to the playoffs. On 
Saturday, the Rockies swept 
the Philadelphia Phillies to win 
the NL Championship Series. 
These wins are shocking to 
baseball fans because over the 
past decade, the Rockies have 
arguably been one of the worst 
MLB teams.
Until this year, the Rockies 
had only made the playoffs once 
in their franchise history. They 
have one of the league’s lowest 
payrolls, and they heavily in­
vest in unsuccessful players like 
Mike Hampton. So what makes 
the 2007 season different? In 
2007, the Rockies proved that 
homegrown talent fused with 
veteran experience could lead 
them to the playoffs.
During the last off-season, 
the NL West teams signed some 
big-name players. The Dodgers 
signed ace Jason Schmidt to 
lead their starting rotation. The 
San Francisco Giants gave $126 
million to starting pitcher Barry 
Zito. While their competition 
made big free-agent signings, 
the Rockies had a quiet off­
season. Colorado only made 
one modest trade when they 
moved their second-best start­
ing pitcher, Jason Jennings, to 
Houston for Jason Hirsh, Taylor 
Buchholz, and Willy Taveras.
However, the Rockies had 
a core of young talent, includ­
ing ace Jeff Francis, outfielder 
Matt Holliday, third baseman 
Garrett Atkins, and outfielder 
Brad Hawpe. In addition, they 
had the always-reliable veteran 
Todd Helton and one of the 
best closers in the game, Brian 
Fuentes.
The Los Angeles Dodgers and 
San Diego Padres dominated 
the division prior to the All-Star 
Break. After the break, the Ari­
zona Diamondbacks came out 
of nowhere and took the divi­
sion lead with a strong pitching 
staff led by Brandon Webb. With 
the top of the division crowded, 
no one considered the Rock­
ies a serious contender. Sure, 
they were only five games out 
during most of the season, but 
nobody thought that they could 
overtake the Dodgers, Padres, 
and the D’backs.
Someone should have been 
carefully watching the Rockies 
when they swept the red-hot 
New York Yankees at home 
during June’s interleague play.

morning and it was a really quick 
match,” Toney said. “When you 
play less competitive teams they 
slow you down, so being able to 
seal the deal in 51 minutes was 
good for us.”
Against Pitt-Greensburg, 
Brackin and Amaechi led the 
Tartans in kills, collecting 11 
and eight, respectively. Carter 
added 33 assists, and Griffin tal­
lied 12 digs and nine service aces 
in the win.
This weekend the Tartans 
will travel to Cleveland, £>hio,
They out-pitched and out- 
slugged a “superior” Yankees 
offense. Or what about the time 
they swept the best NL team, 
the New York Mets, in July?
Most importantly, the Rock­
ies put together an unbelievable 
September, going 20-8. Rookie 
Manny Corpas, who replaced 
Brian Fuentes as the new closer, 
had a 2.08 ERA with 22 saves. 
With Corpas stabilizing the 
back end of the bullpen, Jeff 
Francis led the front end of the 
starting rotation, going 17-9 
and making him a Cy Young 
contender for this year.
The offense led by MVP fa­
vorite Matt Holliday, Rookie of 
the Year candidate Troy Tulow- 
itzki, and veteran Todd Helton, 
was first in batting average, 
first in hits, second in RBIs, and 
second in runs scored.
With a significantly improved 
pitching staff and powerhouse 
offense, the Rockies did the un­
thinkable, winning the last 13 
of 14 regular season games to 
force a one-game play-off with 
the San Diego Padres at home.
Most fans expected the Pa­
dres to win because they had 
ace Jake Peavy and superior 
bullpen pitching on their side. 
The Rockies knocked off a 
struggling Peavy early in the 
game, but the game went into 
extra innings. In the top of the 
13th inning, the Padres took 
the lead with a two-run homer 
and sent the best closer in the 
game, Trevor Hoffman, to the 
mound.
However, the Rockies never 
gave up and put together a rally 
to score three runs to win the 
game. In order to score the win­
ning run, Matt Holliday went 
face down into home plate try­
ing to avoid a tag from catcher 
Michael Barrett. Holliday prob­
ably did not touch the plate, but 
his determination and sacrifice 
illuminated the persistence of 
the hungry Rockies team.
The Philadelphia Phillies 
also had an improbable run 
to the playoffs, overcoming a 
New York Mets team that had a 
seven-game lead with 17 games 
left in the season. Yet, even the 
Phillies couldn’t stop the surg­
ing Rockies; the Rockies swept 
the Phillies on Saturday at 
home.
For all the doubters, the 
Red Sox did the unthinkable 
in 2004 by winning the World 
Series. The White Sox, which 
had one of the longest World 
Series droughts, won in 2005. 
Why can’t the Rockies win it all 
in 2007? It might be just their 
year.

(10 a.m.) and Brandeis Uni­
versity (12:30 p.m.) Saturday, 
and Emory University (9 a.m.) 
and the University of Rochester

“We haven’t beaten [New York

year, so I really want to come 
out of that game on top and set 
the tone for the rest of the week­
end,” Toney said. “Emory is rated

Last Monday Carnegie Mel­
lon, along with 10 other teams, 
participated in the Westminster 
Invitational at the New Castle 
Country Club.
The Tartans had a strong out­
ing, finishing in second place 
overall with a carded score of 
307. The Tartans finished three 
strokes behind Division II rival 
Clarion University which shot a 
combined 304 for the day.
“We were going in hoping to 
win,” junior Alex Timmons said. 
“We didn’t lose anything by los­

Griffin, who one touched the

ing from behind is not what we

week, lost a close match 6-8.
Trailing 1-2 heading into the 
singles, California showed why 
it is one of the top programs and 
seized the momentum from Car­
negie Mellon, sweeping all six 
singles matches to win 7-2.
“California of PA is one of the 
elite Division II programs in the 
nation. We wanted to come out 
and battle, which we did as we 
had them on the ropes after dou­
bles,” head coach Andy Girard 
said. “To show such tremendous 
heart against such a tough team 
was very encouraging. The expe­
rience from this match will serve 
us well when we go against the 
top teams in Division III.”
If California was a tough task, 
the Tartans faced a monumental 
task in taking on 2006 NCAA 
champion W & L Saturday at 
home. Carnegie Mellon was un­
daunted and nearly gave W & L 
the shock of the season, losing an 
epic battle 4-5. Carnegie Mellon’s 
doubles teams, which have been 
unstoppable this season, ^laimed 
two victories with Staloch/Chui 
and Herrick/Hart prevailing 8-6 
and 8-4, respectively
In singles, sophomore Alisa 
Liebowitz held her nerve in a 20
nus to beat a Division II team.”
Carnegie Mellon’s team of five 
representatives set the bar high 
as they would all finish the day 
within the top 20 golfers. Among 
them was Timmons, who led 
the competition by shooting a
70, two under par. Timmons re­
ceived individual medal honors 
as he scored under par for his 
third straight match.
“On the front nine I was kind 
of struggling.” Timmons said. “I 
was just keeping it together. Then 
on the back nine some things just 
clicked and I started playing bet­
ter.”
Timmons was paired with Nick 
Sanner of Clarion University 
who placed one stroke behind 
Timmons with a score of 71.

we are coming back really shows 
how much pride, how much work 
ethic we do have to fight back.” 
Still trailing by one with time 
running out, the Tartans were 
awarded a throw-in near the left 
end line. Sophomore midfielder 
Jonathan Simon threw the ball in 
toward the goal, sophomore for­
ward Patrick Lutz redirected the 
ball toward the front of the goal, 
and Bogus headed the loose ball 
at Baron, who bobbled the ball 
while stepping back, causing the
point second-set tiebreak, win­
ning 6-4,7-6 (9). Hart, not just a 
doubles specialist, won a singles 
match 7-5, 3-6, 14-12 in which 
all that ultimately separated the 
players was a mere two points.
Lauren Caire, who beat Amy 
Staloch in the semifinals of the 
ITA regional tournament two 
weeks ago, continued to be the 
Tartans’ worst nightmare, this 
time doing the damage against 
Chui, beating her 7-6 (6), 6-4. 
In a rematch of the ITA regional 
doubles championship though, 
Staloch/Chui again defeated 
Caire and partner Katie Tabb
8-6.
“Our team is going to be Very 
good this year, especially in dou­
bles. We have the ability to beat 
lots of teams that may be ranked 
higher than us, which will reflect 
very well upon out conference,” 
Hart said, who won doubles 
matches against California, W & 
L, and Grove City.
The Tartans didn’t have any 
time to hang their heads in disap­
pointment after W & L snatched 
the match from the Tartans’ 
hands. Later Saturday, the Tar­
tans returned to the courts to 
take on Grove City. As it turned 
out, Grove City was in the wrong 
place at the wrong time. The Tar­
tans, still full of nervous energy
“On 18 I made about a 14-foot 
putt for par to beat him and I 
knew at that point that I would 
probably win,” Timmons said.
Other notable scores included 
junior Joshua Chen who com­
pleted his first top-10 finish 
shooting a 77 on the day which 
tied him for fifth place. Sopho­
more Chris Lee ended the day 
finishing 12th with a score of 79. 
Howard Smith ended his day in 
14th place with a final score of 
81. Lastly, Blake Darby came in 
at 17th place with 82 strokes.
“We hoped to win but we 
didn’t shoot ourselves in the 
foot for coming in second place,” 
Timmons said.
The Tartans also had four play­
ers participate in the individual
ball to cross the goal line and tie 
the game at two.
“It went off a head of some de­
fender and just came right across 
the goal mouth and I leapt in the 
air, headed it, and it went off the 
goalie’s hands and in,” Bogus 
said. “It ended up on the goal line 
and I knew it was in, it had to be 
in.”
The 20 minutes of overtime 
went back and forth with each 
team having a couple scoring 
opportunities, although none 
materialized. “Just don’t let up
from battling W & L, thoroughly 
outclassed Grove City, winning
9-0.
From the “1, 2, 3, Carnegie 
Mellon!” shouted by the team, 
Carnegie Mellon put the pressure 
on Grove City. The doubles team 
of Loar/Nakamura showed good 
communication and teamwork 
and hit up the middle to con­
found their opponents. Loar and 
Nakamura, smiling and laugh­
ing during the match, pressured 
their opponents by returning 
serve from inside the baseline 
and seizing the net. Liebowitz 
used her two-handed forehand 
to blast shots crosscourt, prompt­
ing a weak reply from her Grove 
City opponent that her partner, 
senior Samantha Schultz, could 
volley at the feet of the other 
Grove City player.
The women’s fall season is 
complete, except for Staloch and 
Chui, who will compete in the 
ITA national tournament next 
week.
Girard is excited for the spring 
season. “Our goals for the spring 
are to continue to improve, work 
hard, and prepare like champi­
ons,” he said. “If we continue to 
do that, things like qualifying for 
NCAAs and having the chance 
to win our conference will take 
care of themselves.”

scored an 82 which put him in

Brent Driscoll wrapped up with

Aio THE TARTAN , .___________ ’ October 8, 2007

The Carnegie Mellon football 
team went into Saturday’s game 
against the Randolph-Macon 
Yellow Jackets looking to end a 
two-game losing streak. Three 
Carnegie Mellon turnovers in the 
first half and time-consuming 
Yellow Jacket drives in the sec­
ond half were the difference in 
the game, as Randolph-Macon 
sent the Tartans to their third 
straight loss by the score of 
21-10.
“We moved the ball pretty 
well,” senior offensive tackle An­
drew Althouse said. “We turned 
it over at bad times and that can’t 
happen. The effort was there but 
we just had some trouble finish­
ing drives.”
The Tartans marched down 
the field on their opening posses­
sion only to have it abruptly end 
with a fumble at the Randolph- 
Macon 2-yard line. Near the end
of the first quarter with the game 
still scoreless, the Tartans again 
coughed the ball up in Yellow 
Jacket territory. Randolph-Ma- 
con capitalized and got on the 
board early in the second quarter 
on a Zak Thornton touchdown 
run.
The Yellow Jackets took a 14-0 
lead midway through the second 
quarter after yet another Tartan 
fumble in Randolph-Macon ter­
ritory. Thornton ran the ball in 
from 11 yards out with 5:09 re­
maining in the first half.
The Tartans answered with 
a 12-play, 8 3-yard touchdown 
drive to cut the deficit in half. Se­
nior fullback Travis Sivek capped 
off the drive with a 5-yard touch­
down run to make it 14-7 with 
only 46 seconds left in the first 
half.
“On defense we came out well, 
but we struggled on a drive or 
two,” senior linebacker Jona­
than Bodnar said. “Overall there 
weren’t too many mistakes. 
Some little things, but they got
corrected real fast. We played 
pretty decent.”
The second half consisted of 
a handful of time-consuming 
drives. After each team punted 
to start the third quarter, Ran­
dolph-Macon took over at their 
17-yard line at the 9:10 mark. 
They ran 14 plays and gained 68 
yards, eating up over eight min­
utes of clock.
The Tartan defense stood tall 
and junior cornerback Steve 
McGovern came up with an in­
terception deep in Tartan terri­
tory with 57 seconds left in the 
third quarter.
The Tartans moved down the 
field, using up almost six min­
utes of clock, before settling for 
a field goal. Tartan junior kicker 
Colin Marks made his first career 
field goal, connecting from 30 
yards out.
The Yellow Jackets, clinging 
to a 14-10 lead, received the 
kickoff and put the game out of

Tartan volleyball dominates home inviteMen’s tennis falters 
at ITA regionals
by Matthew E. Campbell

The men’s tennis team had a 
mediocre showing at the Inter­
collegiate Tennis Association 
(ITA) Southeast regional tour­
nament, held last Saturday and 
Sunday, Sept. 29-30 at the Uni­
versity of Mary Washington in 
Fredericksburg, Va.
On Saturday, four Tartans 
failed to make it out of the first 
round and only three made it to 
the second round. Only first-year 
Alex Nemerov and sophomore 
Jon Spero (a semifinalist last 
year) won two singles matches 
on the first day of the tourna­
ment to reach the round of 16. 
Nemerov partnered with junior 
Yiran Liu to reach the quarterfi­
nals of the doubles.
“I have had a disappointing 
start to the season but I hope to 
have a great regionals and see 
how close I can get to nation­
als,” Nemerov said. “I believe 
that the team can be (top 10 in 
the nation this year and easily 
make NCAAs. We still have a lot
to work on as a team but I think 
we will be much stronger than 
they were last year. We know we 
have a great chance at getting 
a couple players into nationals 
but we have to continue playing 
great doubles like we have.”
On the second day of the tour­
nament, Spero found himself to 
be a big underdog against the 
top-seeded John James of Mary 
Washington. Spero put up a 
spectacular fight, but lost 3-6,
6-4, 5-7.
Nemerov upset the fifth seed, 
Matt Nicholson of Swarthmore,
7-6 (2), 6-3 to advance to the 
quarterfinals. In the quarterfi­
nals, Nemerov ran into a brick 
wall in the form of second- 
seeded Johns Hopkins player 
David Maldow, losing 3-6, 2-6.
In the quarterfinals of the 
doubles draw, Nemerov and Liu 
lost a close match 6-8 to Randy 
Loden and Kaz Murata of Mary 
Washington.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
tennis teamplayedthree matches 
last week against California 
University of Pennsylvania, 
Washington & Lee University, 
and Grove City College.
Carnegie Mellon was unable 
to pull off upsets over California 
and W & L, but finished off the 
week with a solid victory over 
Grove City.
On Tuesday, the Tartans faced 
California, which had finished 
sixth in Division II last year. 
Against five different schools 
this year, California dropped 
only two matches. Carnegie
Mellon doubled that number. In 
the doubles matches, the first- 
year team of Ashley Herrick and 
Kelly Hart demolished their op­
ponents 8-2 and the first-year/ 
junior pairing of Brooke Loar 
and Kelly Nakamura won 8-3.
“Ashley and I beat that team 
by staying positive and commu­
nicating well. We took control 
of the match early by making 
some key plays, and were able 
to maintain our lead from there. 
Ashley and I tried to stay aggres­
sive and good things happened,” 
Hart said.

The women’s volleyball team 
took advantage of home court 
this weekend and dominated 
Franklin & Marshall College 
3-1, Lake Erie College 3-0, and 
University of Pittsburgh-Greens- 
burg 3-0 during the Carnegie 
Mellon Invitational which took 
place in the UC gym. The Tartans 
have won their last five matches. 
Their season record stands at 
12-8 and 2-1 in the University 
Athletic Association (UAA).
On Friday evening, Carnegie 
Mellon faced the F & M Diplo­
mats; surging early, the Tartans 
won the first game 30-18. The 
Diplomats fought back to take 
the second 30-28, despite a late 
Tartan rally which tied the game 
at 27-27.
Carnegie Mellon increased its 
pressure and won the next two 
games by scores of 30-21 and 
30-22, respectively, to secure 
the match victory. Senior Abbie 
Toney (14), first-year Caroline 
Size (12), junior ChisomAmaechi 
(12), senior Kate Stepp (10), and 
sophomore Jessica Brackin (10)
collected double-digit kills for 
the Tartans.
“Friday night’s Franklin & 
Marshall game was really fun,” 
Toney said. “It was senior night. 
A lot of people showed up to 
watch and everyone on the court 
was performing. Any game when 
you have five hitters with double 
digits is impressive.”
Sophomore Samantha Carter 
added 56 assists and three ser­
vice aces to the Tartan offense. 
First-year Cameron Griffin led 
Carnegie Mellon’s defense with 
13 digs. Sophomore Liz DeVlem- 
ing and Stepp contributed eight
digs apiece.
The team’s confidence car­
ried into Saturday as the Tartans 
easily swept Lake Erie (30-24, 
30-22, 30-14) and Pitt-Greens- 
burg (30-13, 30-22, 30-27).
Against Lake Erie, Toney again 
led the Tartans in kills, accu­
mulating eight throughout the 
match. Size and sophomore Me­
gan Killeen each added seven 
kills to the team total. Carter 
amassed 37 assists, while Griffin 
collected 10 digs.

Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team played once this past 
week, in a University Athletic 
Association (UAA) showdown 
on Saturday against the Uni­
versity of Chicago Maroons in 
Gesling Stadium. Both teams 
entered the game looking for 
their first win in UAA play and 
Chicago nearly got theirs, except 
for some late-game heroics from 
Tartan first-year Adam Bogus.
Bogus made his first career 
goal a memorable one as his 
header tied the game with under 
three minutes to go in regulation 
time. Neither Carnegie Mellon
nor Chicago scored in overtime, 
resulting in the two teams set­
tling for a 2-2 tie.
The Maroons (5-5-1,0-1-1 in 
the UAA) got on the board in the 
18th minute when sophomore 
forward Edgar Friloux chased 
down a long pass, flicked the ball 
past charging Tartan junior goal­
keeper Matthew Bazin and then 
placed the ball into the empty 
net. Chicago first-year forward 
Alex Clifford put the Maroons 
up 2-0 in the 32nd minute when 
he laced a kick into the net from 
30 yards out.

mounted their comeback bid late 
with sophomore forward Ricky

The women’s soccer team 
hosted the Allegheny College 
Gators on Wednesday and the 
University of Chicago Maroons 
on Saturday at Gesling Stadium. 
The team tallied a 0-0 tie against 
the Gators and their first Univer­
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
win of the season against the 
Maroons 3-0, with three goals 
from junior midfielder Abigail 
Coffin. The Tartans advanced to 
a 6-4 record overall and 1-1 in 
the UAA.
Double overtime could not de­
termine a winner in the match 
against Allegheny. Despite the 
Tartans taking eight shots in 
comparison to three by the Ga­
tors, no goals resulted in the 
match.
Carnegie Mellon’s defen­
sive back line of juniors Sarah 
DeWath and Mary Ashe, sopho­
more Casey Garth, and first-year 
Emily Overstreet maintained 
composure and prevented the Ga­
tors offense from penetrating.
Allegheny first-year goal­
keeper Kesley Mozzoni made 
one save during the game while 
Tartan first-year goalkeeper 
Anya Rosen did not make any.
The University of Chicago 
match marked the first UAA 
home game of the 2007 season, 
bringing much anticipation and 
pressure to both teams. Going 
into the match, the Tartans were 
0-1 in the UAA with a 2-0 loss
against Washington (Mo.) Uni­
versity. The Maroons were also 
winless in the UAA, having pre­
viously tied Emory 0-0 in double 
overtime.
Tartan senior midfielder 
Amanda Rose struck a free kick 
into the 18-yard box directly to 
Coffin’s head. Coffin smashed 
the ball just out of reach of Chi­
cago senior goalkeeper Amanda 
Sutter, scoring the match’s first 
goal in the 24th minute. The 
Tartans closed the first half with 
a 1-0 lead.
Carnegie Mellon had a second 
scoring opportunity off of a set 
play in the 84th minute. Rose 
placed the ball into the box and 
it scurried past Sutter, giving 
Coffin a wide open net and her 
second goal of the match.
Nearly a minute and a half 
later, Chicago retaliated with 
their first goal of the game when 
sophomore Claire Gill crossed a 
ball into the center of the field 
for junior midfielder Siggy Nach- 
tergaele to volley past Rosen.
Carnegie Mellon ceased to be 
content with a one-goal advan­
tage. Senior midfielder Jessica 
Howard served a cross into the 
center of the field, which Coffin 
headed into the lower far corner 
of the goal in the 89th minute.
Coffin recorded her third goal 
of the match and has racked up 
10 goals this season. She regis­
ters four career hat tricks and 
was named UAA Co-Athlete of 
the Week on Oct. 1.

Linda Babcock explores negotiation and gender differences
When the Heinz School of Public Policy's Linda 
Babcock noticed that male Ph.D. students were • 
getting more opportunities to travel to conferences, 
get exemptions from course requirements, and teach 
their own classes, she began to question the system. 
What she found was surprisingly simple — the reason- 
men get more opportunities than women, and the 
title of her book on the subject, is Women Don't Ask.
Women Don't Ask: Negotiation and the Gender 
Divide explores the idea that women are generally 
reluctant to negotiate for the things they want and 
deserve, a premise confirmed in Babcock’s recent 
study at Arizona State University. Babcock finds 
that this is true for nearly all women, old and young, 
Ph.D.s and high school graduates, because they 
have grown up in a society that projects the image 
of docile, complacent females through role models 
in pop culture. According to Babcock, pop culture 
promotes “the message that negotiating is outside 
the range of behaviors that is acceptable for them.” 
Pop culture paints a very different for males: “The role 
models for boys portray very assertive behavior as 
being normative," she said.
Tepper School of Business professor Laurie Weingart 
notices the same effects in the negotiation class she 
teaches. "Female students are more likely to take my 
course because of their discomfort with negotiating," 
she said, "whereas [males] are more likely to be there 
to hone their skills."
Though society's examples make women reluctant 
to argue for themselves, they do not affect women’s 
negotiation skills. "Women are natural negotiators 
when it comes to protecting others they care for,” 
Weingart said.
The focus on the needs of others at the expense 
of one’s own is a personality trait that psychology 
professor Vicki Helgeson calls “unmitigated 
communion" (UC). UC scores are generally higher in 
women than in men, Helgeson explained. "People 
who score higher on UC are more accommodating 
and give up more during negotiationsshe said. This 
can have extensive consequences.
*
According to Babcock's website, 
www. womendontask. com, 
a woman loses half a million 
dollars during her career by 
failing to take five minutes to 
negotiate her first job offer.
Women also advance more 
slowly in the business world 
because, rather than asking to 
be considered for important 
assignments and promotions, they 
expect to be noticed for hard work alone
VVomen are also reluctant to negotiate in their 
personal lives. According to Babcock, married 
women do two-thirds of the homemaking, even 
when they work full time. Because women 
refuse to ask their partners for help around the 
house, they have markedly less leisure time. This 
causes women extra stress that can lead to heart
disease, diabetes, and other health conditions, 
which is consistent with. Helgeson’s findings. 
Babcock explained that even though women should 
defy social norms by negotiating as often as men, 
they also have to appeal to those norms by arguing 
in a more feminine way. While she acknowledges 
that this perpetuates a double standard, Babcock 
argued, “the alternative isn’t great either — 
negotiating aggressively in some situations may 
cost women more than it might gain them.” 
Babcock suggested that a more moderate approach 
helps women get what they want, while reducing 
the chance that they will be perceived as overly 
aggressive.
“Women generally like women who speak in an 
assertive manner and find them credible and 
competent,” Helgeson said. “Men, however, do not 
like women who speak assertively, although they 
view them as competent.” Helgeson maintained 
that society needs to erase unequal behavior 
expectations for women and men, perhaps through 
exposing both genders to more assertive women 
through interaction in the workplace. As this 
happens, Helgeson said, “The expectations [for 
women] will change.”
While today’s adults are equalizing the definitions 
of acceptable behavior for men and women, 
Helgeson and Babcock agree that future workers 
should also be conditioned to accept these 
changes. "We need to change the way we socialize 
boys and girls, and that's a tall order,” Babcock 
said. But first, she explained, society must accept 
that there is a problem. "After all,” said Babcock, 
“hasn’t the women's revolution been 'won’?”
For her part in changing the social norms, Babcock 
has founded the Program for Research and 
Outreach on Gender Equity in Society (PROGRESS) 
to teach girls to negotiate. From PROGRESS, Girl 
Scouts can even earn a badge for negotiation.
Helgeson proposes that home life must also be 
restructured. “I think the most important change 
that society can make regarding the way it
¦ socializes boys and girls 
/ , is for men and women/ y -JLpf to be equally involved
in household labor,” 
she said. Children would then 
benefit from, in Helgeson’s 
words, “models of mothers and 
fathers who display nurturance 
and competence.”
Though all three women 
agree that change is very 
possible, they also know it won't happen 
overnight. "People have to get used to 
this behavior," Helgeson said, "and it is 
going to take some time.”

About breast nomenclature and New Age girlfriends 
Hi Myrtle, Dear Myrtle,
I love my girlfriend very much 
— she’s sweet and considerate 
(and quite easy on the eyes) 
and I hope we’ll be together a 
very long time. There’s just one 
problem — I’m an atheist and 
she’s what she calls a “spiritualist 
metaphysicist.” I believe in 
evolution and the scientific 
method, and she believes in 
auras and crystal healing and 
chakras. I’ve worked very hard 
to accept her beliefs, and she’s 
tried to accept mine, but I have 
a lot of trouble not cracking up 
when she insists on trying to 
heal my paper cuts with reiki 
(they still hurt like hell afterward) 
or shouting at her when she 
explains how black people look 
different because they were 
seeded on Earth by different 
kinds of aliens. And then she 
gets really upset when I try to 
talk to her about my philosophy 
or something cool I heard in 
the news about evolutionary 
psychology. Is our relationship 
doomed, or can I save it?
—Sad Unbeliever Boyfriend
My poor SUB,
You've certainly got the cards 
stacked against you. But all is not 
lost — yet. Couples can live happily 
with utterly different views, as long 
as they love and respect (let me 
repeat a ia Arethra: R-E-S-P-E-C-T) 
each other, think carefully about 
this. You don’t agree with your 
girlfriend's views, but do you respect 
them? Truly? Or do you think, deep 
underneath, that she’s a complete 
nut job? (You would, in all honesty, 
be justified in thinking so.) How 
about her? Does she tolerate your 
beliefs (or lack thereof) and respect 
your rights to them, or might she in 
the deepest recesses of her heart 
cry for your lost soul that will never 
join hers in complete spiritual union? 
It’s time for a heart-to-heart, SUB, 
to discuss these things with your 
girlfriend. If you can't discuss your 
respective beliefs with respect and 
love, I’m afraid you'd better say your 
goodbyes.
Good luck,
Myrtle
I want to name my girlfriend’s 
boobs, since I love them so 
(and she doesn’t mind the idea). 
Here’s the rub: Whenever I try to 
come up with possible names, 
all I can think of are guys’ names. 
Batman and Robin, Ben and 
Jerry, Calvin and Hobbes, Lewis 
and Clark. Does this mean I’m 
gay? Should I tell my girlfriend? 
Help!
Sincerely,
Trouble In Titling
Hello TIT,
Here's how to figure out if you’re 
gay. Close your eyes and imagine 
Orlando Bloom and Jake Gyllenhaal 
wrestling, naked, at the ocean’s 
edge, foam dotting their firm, 
writhing bodies. If that image 
excited you even half as much as 
it excited me (did it just get hot in 
this column, or is it just me?) then 
you’re probably gay, or bi, and you 
should probably tell your girlfriend 
about that. But just wanting to name 
her boobs after guys is not the best 
litmus test for homosexuality. If she's 
not too disturbed by the idea, I see 
no problem in going with a male pair, 
but I would run it by her first. And 
if you’re really just stuck for female 
names, you should turn to our ally 
in these troubled times, the great 
Google. I put in “female name pairs” 
and got two million hits at once. 
Good luck and good naming!
Love,
Myrtle
P.S.: Mine are named Simon and 
Garfunkel, and they don’t seem to 
be having a gender identity crisis. 
Right, guys?

Getting to know the PSO
Musicians weigh in on performing and teaching
After the sold-out opener last weekend, the Pittsburgh 
Symphony Orchestra (PSO) is sawing, bowing, and tooting 
its way to another season of great performances, great 
personalities, and of course, great music. To hear these 
musicians live is a treat; to get to know their thoughts on 
conductors, repertoire, collaboration, and the art of making 
music is just as rewarding.
This season’s program includes a variety of music for 
all tastes: a number of classical blockbusters, Broadway 
favorites, pop tunes, and everything from film scores to 
excerpts from Wagner's operas. Offering such a broad 
repertoire, the PSO is sure to please a range of audiences, but 
what about the performers?
PSO concertmaster, Grammy-nominated artist, and Carnegie 
Mellon violin professor Andrés Cárdenes enjoys, in his 
words, "virtually every piece I play or conduct.” Cardenes 
is especially eager to play Stravinsky’s "Firebird Suite" and 
Respighi's "Feste Romane,” and to conduct Hindemith’s 
"Music for Strings and Brass.” In the spirit of musical 
collaboration, he is also looking forward to Elgar's “Cello 
Concerto” with colleague and friend Anne Martindale 
Williams, the principal cellist for the PSO and an artist 
lecturer at Carnegie Mellon. A multifaceted musician of 
many extensions — orchestral, solo, chamber — Cárdenes 
is also growing in demand as a conductor; this season he
will conduct a Pittsburgh Symphony Chamber Orchestra 
performance in late March, in addition to the late April 
concert of Hindemith and Schumann’s Third Symphony.
The PSO is entering a transitional year, leading to a new 
music director for the 2008-09 season, Manfred Honeck. 
Thus, the repertoire this season is more generalized with a 
variety of conductors taking the podium, including notable 
names such as Sir Andrew Davis, Marek Janowski, and Yan 
Pascal Tortelier.
"Adjusting to conducting styles is a combination of playing 
the way we think things ought to go ... while keeping our 
eyes and ears open for balances and musical direction 
coming from the podium," explained Robert Lauver, a 
member of the horn section and an artist lecturer in the 
School of Music.
As the performer’s primary goal is to interpret the 
emotions and ideas of the music in a convincing manner, 
the leadership and charisma of a conductor is essential. 
"Conductors vary widely in conducting style — some are 
easier to follow than others,” Lauver said. “The best ones 
have a nice combination of stick technique for ensemble 
precision and musical drive and inspiration.”

Cinema ‘reimaginings’ — from Hitchcock to Shakespeare
After all the movies that came out this summer, you might 
be wondering, "What wasn't a remake?” As even box office 
analysts have a problem predicting hits nowadays, studios 
green-light more updates, remakes, “reimaginings,” and 
covers than ever before. Chances are you realize that She's 
the Man is an update of Shakespeare's Twelfth Night, but 
here are some lesser known remakes.
Disturbia (2007) — Update of: Rear Window (1954)
The creators of Disturbia classify the film as “inspired” by 
the Hitchcock classic. With Disney Channel-transplant 
Shia LaBeouf taking over for Academy Award-winner 
James Stewart, the films are essentially the same, only 
the new version is sexed up for younger viewers. In the 
original, Stewart breaks his leg and must remain at home 
in a wheelchair all day, with nothing to do but spy on his 
neighbors with his telescope. When he thinks he’s witnessed 
a murder, the adrenaline factor intensifies. In Disturbia, 
LaBeouf is placed under house arrest for assaulting a teacher 
and, evidently unable to stomach trashy daytime TV, spies 
on his neighbors only to believe he lives next door to a serial 
killer. Which to watch: While some may try to convince you 
that Rear Window should be seen simply for its classic status, 
don’t buy into it. It’s not the best Hitchcock film to catch. 
Disturbia is a trendy update, but still satisfying. Either will do.
Whatever It Takes (2000) — Update of: Cyrano de 
Bergerac (1897) Don't know this one? Thefe’s a reason. 
Cyrano de Bergerac is a classic French play, centered 
on eponymous Cyrano, a French soldier-slash-poet with 
a big nose. He is in love with his cousin Roxane, but 
cannot convince her to love him back, as she loves one of 
Cyrano's fellow cadets, Christian. Christian is beautiful but
empty-headed, and cannot intellectually romance Roxane, 
even though he loves her. Cyrano creates Christian’s love 
letters and poems, and Roxane falls further in love with 
Christian. In Whatever It Takes (which you can see a few 
times a year at random hours on Comedy Central, so bad it 
is), James Franco marks his second movie role, and Red Bull 
makes its first on-screen appearance. Go, product placement! 
Which to watch: Unless you really like James Ftanco or 
Red Bull, it’s probably better to look at Cyrano de Bergerac. 
There are many versions of Cyrano, first produced as a play 
in 1897, but check out the 1990 Oscar-winner starring French 
actor Gérard Depardieu, If you aren’t in the mood for drama, 
another good alternative is Steve Martin’s 1987 comedic take, 
Roxanne.
Ciiy of Angels (1998) — Update of: Wings of Desire (1986) 
It isn’t often a remake takes a happy ending and throws it 
out — City of Angels is that sort of movie. Nicolas Cage, as 
angel Seth, falls in love with a doctor, Maggie, played by Meg 
Ryan. For some reason, Maggie can see Seth (and no one else 
can), and their friendship slowly builds to a quiet, unspoken 
romance. Unable to date an angel, Maggie becomes engaged 
to a co-worker. Seth meets a former angel, who chose to 
become human, and wrestles with the idea of changing 
for Maggie. In Wings of Desire, subtitled from the original 
German, Damiel falls in love with Marian, a trapeze artist 
who cannot see him. For Marian, Damiel considers becoming 
human. Which to watch: It isn't that City of Angels is a 
bad film, but it cannot compare to Wim Wenders’s direction, 
which won him Best Direction at Cannes. City of Angels is a 
romance; Wings of Desire is a meditation on humanity.
Simon Birch (1999) — Update of: A Prayer for Owen
and the PSO's principal bassoonist, looks for “the depth of 
musicianship” in a conductor. “The better the conductor, the 
easier it is to adjust,” she said.
“Ours and their success depends on establishing a good 
rapport and chemistry," Cárdenes added.
In addition to performing, Cárdenes, Lauver, and Goeres 
enjoy teaching in the studio. Since a good number of 
students are preparing for careers in orchestral performance, 
a professor’s PSO experience is invaluable. Goeres said, 
“[When students] have the opportunities to hear me play in 
the orchestra [they can] hear for themselves if I practice what
I preach.”
"Hopefully my students learn that playing the horn well is 
extremely rewarding, both in the journey ... and to see in our 
accomplishments how far we've come,” Lauver said.
Echoing that sentiment, Cárdenes finds that sharing 
his experiences and knowledge with young violinists is 
extremely fulfilling. He said, “It shows that in the music 
profession, no one ever stops learning or striving to be as fine 
an artist as possible."

Meany (1989) Owen Meany, one of John Irving’s odes to New 
England, follows the protagonist John and titular character 
Owen, best friends since childhood. Owen believes he is an 
instrument of God; John just wishes he knew who his father 
was, that his mother hadn’t died, and that he didn’t have • 
a crush on his cousin. Simon Birch follows Joe and his best 
friend Simon, a little person. Joe wishes his mother wasn't 
dead and he knew who his father was. Which to watch: 
Neither? To be fair, John Irving believed his book could never 
be properly translated to film, and barred the filmmakers from 
using any of the names in his novel, leading to the names in 
Simon Birch. Pick up the Irving paperback instead.
The Lion King (1994) — Update of: Hamlet (1599) Another 
film that claims to be a loose interpretation, The Lion King 
starts when Mufasa, the king of the lions, fathers Simba, the 
new heir to the African animal kingdom. Simba's evil uncle 
Scar kills Mufasa and convinces Simba that the death is his 
fault. Overwhelmed with guilt, the young lion flees home 
into the jungle. In Hamlet, the titular prince is visited by his 
father’s ghost, who explains his death some months prior 
was no accident — Hamlet's uncle Claudius slipped poison 
'in his ear while sleeping, and soon married Hamlet’s mother 
to take over the throne. Hamlet exacts his revenge. Which to 
watch: The Lion King is the best-selling VHS tape of all time 
for a reason, but Hamlet is arguably the best of Shakespeare’s 
dramas. Read the play, watch The Lion King, and — if 
you have time — go and find the new Criterion edition of 
Kenneth Branagh (scene-stealer Gilderoy Lockhart in Harry 
Potter and the Chamber of Secrets)'s four-hour version (1996).

Pinback avoids the gimmicks and Trapt disappointsOn melody
Pinback, Autumn of the Seraphs
It's been three years since Pinback released its last LP, 
Summer in Abaddon. This album of addictive pop hooks 
and mild successes like “Fortress” came out amid the 
excitement of The O.C.’s second season, the premier of 
Garden State, and the soundtracks that accompanied 
them. The negative correlation between mainstream 
success and indie cred was taking root in bands like 
Death Cab for Cutie and Modest Mouse, while a host 
of other groups like Bloc Party and The Arcade Fire 
appeared on the scene, artfully managing to remain 
nationally popular yet appealingly obscure.
On Pinback’s latest record, Autumn of the Seraphs, 
the band has resisted the temptation to infuse their 
songs with hooks and gimmicks to build off Summer in 
Abaddon’s mainstream success. Unlike its predecessor, 
Autumn of the Seraphs is remarkably sparse and 
subdued. We hear no Ben Gibbard-esque reverb in 
lead singer Rob Crow’s powerful voice, and the bass 
and guitars rarely leave the "clean" setting. There’s an 
average of two-and-a-half instruments playing at once, 
backed by an incessant drumbeat that seems to revel in 
its timidity.
Yet, for all the merits of barrenness, the album could 
use a good jolt, It starts out promising with the song 
“From Nothing to Nowhere.” Here, charged vocals 
enter immediately, containing a certain confidence 
suggesting that the album’s remaining indie-pop tunes 
will be of this caliber. Yet this song has an unmistakable 
hollowness, denied all its potential to energize and 
excite. The next few songs are all sufficiently good. 
“Barnes” has a sweet, detached melody that enters 
effortlessly and prevails throughout. “Good to Sea” is 
impressively catchy, though the band's attempts to play 
around with the phrase "good to see” — as seen in the 
title and in the lines "It’s good to see you / it’s good to 
see you go” — come off as forced and silly. As the album 
progresses, however, song quality seems to decrease 
almost linearly. If you’re an animated listener, don’t be 
surprised if your head bobs go from vertical to horizontal 
to non-existent as you move through the album.
Autumn of the Seraphs is overall pleasant and cerebral. 
The songs hover in the air indifferently for you to enjoy 
or discard. Perhaps the only gimmick was putting all of 
the good songs first.

Baby Elephant, Turn My Teeth Up!
Baby Elephant is a funk and hip-hop group from New 
York City comprised of band members Prince Paul (rap, 
production), Newkirk (rap, voiceover, production), and 
Bernie Worrell (keyboard). Their debut album, Turn 
My Teeth Up! features several notable guest artists, 
including George Clinton, Yellowman, and David Byrne. 
(Worrell is a two-time Rock and Roll Hall of Famer who 
performed with David Byrne at the creative peak of the 
Talking Heads.)
The best song on the album, "How Does the Brain 
Wave?” featuring Byrne, is also the track with the most 
plays on Baby Elephant’s MySpace page. The song 
begins with a space-age monologue about a futuristic 
world in the year 3000 and proceeds into a catchy 
refrain: "How does the brain wave / How do my insides 
say hello / We feel the same way / Passion, passion 
smashing down the door.” The funk beat adds an 
interesting dynamic quality underneath the vocals of 
another guest (Nona Hendryx) and the rest of the band. 
While I wouldn't label “How Does the Brain Wave?" as 
a serious club-banger, it succeeds as a funky track with 
surreal lyrics and quality production.
With help from Shock G, the track "Plainfield" infuses 
rap with retro-funk organ and percussion. The intro, 
featuring Anthony Riscica’s drumbeat set to an audio 
sample of children laughing, establishes a sense of 
momentum. But as soon as the rap starts the energy 
plummets, and the track seems to end before it really 
begins. The questionable sampling of what sounds 
like a tenor opera singer makes the track sound very 
disjointed.
On the whole, Turn My Teeth Up! seems to lack a 
necessary sense of continuity and leaves the listener 
feeling somewhat alienated; perhaps the collaboration 
with so many different artists extended the creative and 
sonic scope of the album a bit too far. Each song feels 
like a great idea that never really materialized, as Baby 
Elephant attempts, with little success, to cram in tons 
of random sampling and unresolved musical motifs. 
Although Turn My Teeth Up! features a lot of great 
artists, it feels like a classic example of too many cooks 
spoiling the broth.
Trapt, Live!
Alternative/grunge-rock group Trapt released its first 
live album, Live!, this September. Trapt was formed in 
1997 in Los Gatos, Calif., and the group released its first 
album, Glimpse, in 2000. Band members Chris Brown 
(vocals and guitar), Simon Ormandy (guitar), and Peter 
Charell (bass) have been around since the beginning, 
while drummer Aaron Montgomery recently joined the 
group.
The live release includes two new studio-produced 
songs, "Stay Alive” and “Everything to Lose," the latter 
succeeding as the best song on the album. The verse 
has a genuine emotional and poetic quality, while the 
chorus evokes the grunge-rock energy that Trapt is 
known for. The rest of the album essentially rides on the 
coattails of older post-grunge "hits," with a recording 
production that is average at best. None of the songs 
excel in a live setting, and the recordings fail to exude 
the energy of the crowd. Overall, Live! captures an 
uneventful set of mediocre alternative rock, destined for 
the used bin at your local record store. Trapt, I’d like my 
hour back.

In an interview with Playboy in 1980, John Lennon talked about writing 
the song “Nowhere Man”; “I’d spent five hours that morning trying to 
write a song that was meaningful and good, and I finally gave up and 
lay down,’’ he said. “Then ‘Nowhere Man’ came, words and music, the 
whole damn thing as I lay down."
When we talk about John Lennon, we often recognize him as being one 
of the greatest songwriters in the history of rock music. But for those 
five hours, even in 1965, at the height of the success of the Beatles - 
he couldn't write a good sc>ng. For that matter, after Imagine in 1971, 
Lennon seems to have lost his genius: He spent the last nine years of 
his life writing mediocre, unimpressive pop. This doesn’t seem to make 
sense. During those nine years and especially during those five hours, 
Lennon had everything he needed to write pure pop perfection. He had 
experience, he had written good songs countless times before, and he 
knew more about songwriting than anyone. But it wasn’t enough.
Inconsistencies like this abound in pop music. All too often, bands create 
one immaculate album and then go on to release several sub-par ones. 
I’ve probably listened to The Strokes album Is This It? over 50 times; yet 
I’ve only listened to the band's next two albums once or twice. How did 
Weezer go from the brilliance of The Blue Album and Pinkerton to the 
lamentable Green Album? Another issue: In bands with two guitarists
— both players then equally suited to songwriting — one guitarist often 
winds up writing all of the songs. Finally, there’s also the problem of 
one-hit wonders, where the gift of songwriting enters into a musician for 
just,a few hours or days, leaving him as quickly as it came. The answer 
to all of these problems lies in one thing: vocal melody.
Melody is quite often the most important element of a pop song. It’s 
what you sing along to; it’s what attracts you and makes you come 
back for more. Without well-crafted melodies, pop songs tend to fall 
apart. Unfortunately for songwriters, this most important element is also 
the most elusive. Writing melodies cannot be taught; melodies must be 
summoned, and quite often they just don’t come. The best songwriters 
know what things lead to a good melody: certain chord changes 
(although too much theory can be detrimental), experimentation, and 
practice in general; but none of these strategies will ever guarantee that 
one will come.
To be sure, all art involves this inconsistency. There is no “formula" for 
great literature, painting, poetry, or film, yet melody is somehow different. 
Your brain undergoes an instinctual “yes/no" reaction when it hears a 
melody, while these other art forms usually leave room for a “maybe." 
Melodies can neither hide nor argue.
Give some credit then to those few bands that are capable of putting out 
one solid album after the next. Still, don't be surprised if their next record 
bombs; even John Lennon couldn’t keep it going forever.

Art: It’s TePuJg aHk N/RRAk
Photographer Diana Shearwood examines where we get our food
Upon entering Silver Eye Center for Photography, the viewer is 
surrounded by images of alluring, vivid foods. The images are 
from a project called Behind the Mall by Diana Shearwood, a 
photographer based in Montreal, Canada. The exhibition, titled 
What’s for Dinner?, includes a few larger images hung alone 
and printed on canvas, and 78 smaller images that are hung in 
a grid dominating the wall.
What's For Dinner? showcases advertisements for food on 
trucks from all over the world — China, Morocco, Canada, 
France, and the U.S. Linda Benedict-Jones, the executive 
director of Silver Eye, said that when she first saw Shearwood's 
work on the Behind the Mall project, she instantly fell in love _ 
with it. “It was in your face, you just got it," she said. The 
photographs are very bright, colorful, and lively; they serve 
the viewer with images of delicious-looking food, juicy and 
begging to be consumed. Images of avocados, chili 
peppers, slabs of steak, and cookies create a visual feast that is 
captivating and aesthetically pleasing. The colors and shapes 
draw the viewer in, but there is more information in this 
project than simply the layer of the visual. “This body of work 
was visually captivating and it also brings up an interesting 
discussion,” Benedict-Jones said.
Shearwood's work addresses the food we buy and eat every 
day. Many people don’t seem to pay attention to where their 
produce comes from, but — even in the summer — most
Americans’ apples and berries are not from the farm down the 
street but from the other side of the country or even the world. 
“In July, why doesn’t this supermarket have local food?" asked 
Shearwood in a press release. “There’s something wrong."
Of her project, Shearwood said, “I began to document the 
ever-growing realm of vehicle wrapping. By focusing on these 
ubiquitous moving billboards, I hope to bring-attention to the. 
paradoxical reality that the 20 fresh foods that typically fill your 
shopping basket have traveled over 100,000 miles despite [the 
fact] that many of these items could be sourced nearby." Her 
exhibit captures images — often humorous and sometimes 
disturbing — from mobile food advertising as well as the 
discussion associated with the process.
“In recent years, the transport of food from farm to fork has 
risen dramatically, leading to significant increases in C02 
emissions," Shearwood said. “The irony is that even during the 
growing season when farm markets are crammed with local 
products, supermarkets are stocked with food from far away.” 
But it's not as easy as that. The discussion becomes more 
complicated because the transport of food is an 
unavoidable reality in some respects; people expect fruit and 
vegetables in the wintertime, even in places where those foods 
cannot grow.
In our culture, the demand for all varieties of produce in every

Silver Eye serves up a delicious writing workshop
Ever had the urge to devour the walls around you? The 
participants at Sherrie Flick’s rather “tasteful" writing 
workshop surely did. Last Thursday, Flick kicked off her three- 
part series of writing workshops at the Silver Eye Center for 
Photography. Brightly illuminated walls covered with mouth­
watering photographs of steamy soups, freshly baked bread, 
luscious strawberries, and other delectable .goodies set the 
scene, which Flick used to provoke a sense of perspective and 
characterization within her audience. The photographs were 
all part of Canadian photographer Diana Shearwood’s latest 
exhibit, What's for Dinner?
“The aim of this workshop is to grasp and develop the idea of 
sensory detail, specifically acknowledging the role ‘food’ plays 
in a piece of writing," said Flick, director of the Gist Street 
Reading series.
Flick read aloud short pieces of fiction to the participants, 
demonstrating the relationship between food and the 
characters in each story. The pieces included a section from 
The Art of Eating by M.F. Kisher, as well a short story by Anita 
Brookner from a collection called Flash Fiction Forward.
The pieces examined how food invokes memory, and how the 
presence of food can add to the life of the character or display 
tension in a scene while capturing the reader’s attention. For 
example, a writer can use food to reveal a character’s mood, 
likes, and dislikes, or can create a scene where there is either 
an abundance or a scarcity of food, and then show what 
it means to the characters and plot. The workshop lasted 
two hours and involved both contemplative and fast-paced 
writing.

The workshop’s first exercise focused on the memories and 
associations inspired by pictures of foods. What's for Dinner? 
is currently on exhibit at Silver Eye Center for Photography, 
so participants were surrounded by images of different types 
of food. Participants were asked to look around and jot down 
their reminiscences. The results comprised a variety of 
concepts, from people and places to times and situations.
“The image of the golden-brown muffin topped with a cube 
of cheese reminded me of home and lazy Sunday mornings,” 
said one participant said.
Here, Flick helped participants transition their thoughts from 
food to specific moments in their lifetime in which these 
foods were somehow involved. Flick said that a writer’s job 
is to “evoke” those feelings of sensory detail in the heart and 
mind of the reader.
“You can use so many gestures with food in storytelling; it 
sheds light on the character, especially when placed in vital - 
stances such as the opening scene and dialogues," said Flick.
The next writing drill focused on smell. Here, the participants 
were asked to describe what they imagined the food in each 
image would smell like. Diverse viewpoints emerged and led 
to a thorough discussion of why aroma is one of the most 
difficult senses to describe or convey in literature.
"Reaching out to the reader’s olfaction through words is one 
of a writer’s greatest capabilities, because it makes you use 
other things around the character, and eventually leads to 
describing a whole scenario," said Flick.
season has created the notion of what Shearwood calls 
“permanent global summertime." She said, "As a result, the 
notion of seasonal produce has been replaced by a cheap, 
plentiful and steady supply of colorless bland commodities.”

In the final segment of the workshop, the participants 
explored the representational elements in food through 
similes and metaphors. Once again, they were asked to 
observe the images of food and express those images in 
figurative language.
In this exercise, a participant referred to an exuberant image 
of hot red peppers as “the fiery passion of forbidden love," 
while another described a photo of ripe tomatoes as "a heart 
full of surprises and abandoned virtues.” Some participants 
had significantly varied perspectives on the same photograph. 
For example, while one saw a well-done steak as "a coral 
reef," another viewed it as a "harbor for bones.” ¦
“The key lies in understanding the control you have over your 
thoughts and words. Then, you can mix and blend the way 
you like,” Flick said.
At the end of the evening, Flick asked the participants to 
prepare a short piece of narrative fiction about food using the 
concepts they learned in the session. The participants will 
discuss their work during the workshop’s next meeting.

Lights, camera, black and gold
Local filmmakers’ The Steal Phantom chronicles football and coming-of-age
“The Steelers will never die, that's just a way of life."
These are the’words of 21-year-old filmmaker Jason 
Georgiades. To any native of the Steel City, it's a certain and 
unassailable fact — Pittsburgh bleeds black and gold.
But beyond die-hard support and consumerism, can we as 
fans play a larger role in our team's success? Georgiades 
wanted to find out. Armed with only a cameraman and a 
top-secret play in a briefcase handcuffed to his wrist, he 
aimed to get one of the most popular NFL franchises in 
history to run his own offensive play.
What resulted is a film called The Steal Phantom (the name 
of the offensive play), the brainchild of Georgiades and 
fellow filmmaker Trevar Cushing. The pair met in Craigslist. 
The Steal Phantom, a 64-minute documentary, follows 
their journey as fans and filmmakers as they try to get their 
"secret" gadget play in the hands of the Steelers’ 
then-offensive coordinator, Ken Whisenhunt.
At its core, the film is not only about their quest to see the 
Steelers run a fan’s play, but also an attempt to understand 
the changing dynamic of fan-player relationships. In the film, 
Georgiades and Cushing roam across the country, speaking 
to drunken fans in stadium parking lots, minor league 
coaches, managers experimenting with new ways to involve 
fans, and even Steelers legend and Hall of Fame inductee 
Jack Ham.
The people Georgiades encountered all echoed the same 
idea:"... The NFL has become this self-sustaining entity, like 
a bureaucracy, and if someone leaves, there’s just someone 
who comes up to fill that spot," he said. "The. Steelers are 
just a bunch of jerseys people fill in, and the fans somehow 
identify with that — it’s not associated with players or 
people.”
The film debuted last Friday at the University of Pittsburgh,
NO MOVIE
Wednesday, October 10
My papers and exams are done. 
I’m going to sleep. Maybe you 
should, too. Otherwise, don’t 
you have a paper to write?
and Georgiades is pleased with the project so far. “It's just 
good to have that under your belt,” he said. "I had no idea 
what I was getting myself into — it’s one of those things 
where you just take and idea and run with it.”
Interestingly, some of the film’s most powerful imagery 
actually occurs outside of the city, such as when the 
filmmakers stumble upon a Steelers bar in Chicago. Another 
example is an interview with the -legendary Cleveland 
Browns fan known as "The Bone Lady,” who sports an 
enormous hat of hot-glued plastic Browns paraphernalia.
In the interview, "The Bone Lady” fights back tears while 
talking about the loyalty that Browns fans exhibit in spite of 
the team’s losing record.
The Steal Phantom transcends football. It portrays the 
difficult learning process any young person faces when 
trying to complete a massive project. The film features 
Georgiades, half-asleep, desperately waiting in a parking 
lot at 4:30 a.m. for the first truck to deliver a bundle of city 
newspapers containing an article on his film. When it finally 
arrives, he is suddenly alive, childishly giddy, handing out 
free copies to the inebriated clientele of a nearby gas station.
The Steelers never wound up running Georgiades's play, but 
the high point of the movie comes after the two filmmakers 
discover that, in their words, if they "just call” WTAE-TV, the 
local news will actually cover their project. The film becomes 
momentarily inaudible due to laughter and applause, as 
Cushing casually remarks, “It’s Pittsburgh, so I guess they’re 
hurting for stories."
“People think of Pittsburgh as this blue collar, Steelers, let’s 
get ’em, thing," said Georgiades, in a mock-Yinzer accent.’ 
"But there’s more to it... there’s this interesting undercurrent 
of art.”
Disillusioned with the promise of media-saturated cities 
like New York and Los Angeles, Georgiades feels the open 
market of Pittsburgh has untapped promise and potential, 
which he likens to .parts of ’70s Manhattan just before the 
punk explosion.
“It’s all right in front of you,” he said proudly, citing the local
musicians, writers, and comedians who helped with the 
film’s production and release. "I don’t know why I’d want to 
leave here."
Emboldened by his first feature-length film, Georgiades now 
looks forward to working on several new smaller projects (he 
is currently laying the groundwork for a music video), but he 
remains resolute in his support for what he sees as the 
“up-and-coming” art scene in Pittsburgh. "I think the city 
really backs the locals,” Georgiades said. "I'm almost glad 
people are always leaving ... It’s like, ‘Great, I have a void I

Waitress
Thursday, October 11
8 10 12
A cute and quirky film about 
a waitress and pie. Unhappily 
married, Jenna (the waitress) 
has plans to leave her husband, 
when — oops! — she’s 
pregnant. There’s an affair with 
her doctor, a pie-baking contest, 
and (of course) a diner. Not your 
traditional romantic comedy, 
it’s worth a look. Oh, and did I 
mention that the main character 
is played by Felicity's Keri 
Russell?
Live Free or Die Hard
Friday, October 12 
7:30 10 12:30
I know lots of people think this 
movie is one too many in the Die 
Hard series, but those people 
probably didn’t see it. You 
don’t have to have seen any of 
the other Die Hards to get the 
plot, nor do you only have to 
be a guy to like it (there’s other 
stuff besides huge bangs and 
explosions). There are three 
things people say about this 
movie:
1. “Hilariously funny.”
2. “He crashed a car. Into a 
plane.” .
3. “Dude! That was Tuvok!”
Shrek the Third
Saturday, October 13 
8:15 10 11:45
If it hadn’t been the sequel to 
the original Shrek and Shrek 
2,1 can guarantee you this 
movie would have bombed in 
theaters. This isn’t to say that 
Shrek the Third doesn’t have 
its moments, but that’s all they 
are — moments. The plot: Shrek, 
Donkey, and Puss in Boots go 
on an adventure to find the next 
King Arthur (Justin Timberlake), 
and Princess Fiona shows some 
girl power and kicks Prince 
Charming’s ass. Woohoo.
Mulholland Drive
Sunday, October 14 
7:30 10 12:30
A mind-bending thriller, Mulholland 
Drive will leave you confused and 
awed. It’s nice to watch Naomi 
Watts freak out (there’s something 
about amnesiacs). Moreover, the 
cinematography is amazing; most of 
it seems surreal and dreamlike, and 
it’s all one big puzzle. If you just want 
a movie that takes little brainpower 
to watch, this is not it.

If driving a Mercedes Benz, wearing power suits to the of|l 
and vacationing in the Hamptons are part of your 8ve-y&a|| 
plan, freelance writing probably isn't for you, If, however, you 
are good with deadlines and rejec&on, have always loved "1 
reading and writing, and dor^^pii^^M m the cover M Forbes, you might be the perfect candidate for the Job" - i
There are no specific requirements for freelance writing: You 
can hold a degree in history or chemical engineering, be 
fresh out of college, or getting ready for your 10-year reunion. 
Many writers do work in other fields or have a non-writing 
background before they make the leap.to freelance writing, 
Deesha Philyaw, a local freelancer who owns her own custom 
writing company and writes a column for the online literary 
magazine LiteraryMama.com, studied economics as an 
undergraduate at Yale University and received her master's 
degree in teaching from Manhattanviile College. “When I 
was in school, I was being practical," Philyaw said. "I was 
the first person in my family to go to college, so the idea of 
writing seemed really irresponsible."
Though writing may have seemed like a pipe dream to 
Philyaw, its appeal eventually overcame her pragmatism. 
After stints in management consulting and teaching, 
Philyaw decided to try her hand at freelancing. “Ultimately 
I chose to do something I love," she said. “I thought about 
what I really wanted to do all along, and it was ¡writing] — 
somjlhing that I actually cared about. I’m an avid reader 
andff love words and good writing, so I decided to pursue 
itJfMost freelancers trade the security of being an employee
¦ the challenge of self-employment and the fulfillment 
if doing something they've always dreamed of. “I don't 
now anybody who freelances but would rather be doing 
something else," Philyaw said.
They don’t call it freelancing' for nothing; another perk of the
- job is the flexibility that comes with it Freelancers make 
their own hours and come up with their own articles. Unlike 
staff writers who are generally assigned topics by their 
editors; freelancers can choose their own subject matter.

and writers’ groups can also serve to alleviate the oft-cited 
loneliness of freelance writing, while still providing useful 
suggestions for revision.
The location
In some ways, freelancers are always working. They are 
constantly looking to the world around them for ideas. 
"Everything I do or see or hear is material," said Williams,

Freelance writers aren’t in it for the money; only the most in bed, freelancers with families often find it difi

unknown writers, pay varies by writing type. According to home "offlcs" can —

that goes into getting work published.
:r dreaded buzzword of corporate fame: networking. 
"Networking is something 1 never thought I'd do in my life, 
but it’s pretty important,’’ Williams said. Most freelancers 
attend writers' conferences to make useful contacts. After 
trying to sell a book for 10 years about planting trees in Haiti, 
Williams met an editor at a conference who had planted 
trees in Haiti. "Of course she bought the book,” Williams 
said.
Writers can send unsolicited work to generic e-mail 
addresses at tljeir publication of choice (editor@insert-name- 
of-publication-here.com) and hope that it eventually finds 
its way to the right person, but it's far more effective to have 
editors’ names and direct e-mail addresses.
For freelancers, the best kind of work is solicited work.
Most journals and anthologies periodically have open calls 
for submissions asking writers to send in essays, creative 
nonfiction, poems, and fiction. Calls for submissions detail 
the type of writing the publication is looking for and the 
deadline by which pieces need to be submitted: Instead 
of searching the Internet for hours looking for calls for 
submissions, freelancers often add their name to an e-mail 
list that sends them several calls for submissions daily. You 
an sign up for an e-mail list on Yahoo Groups.

pst freelancers have websites where interested editors can 
out about their writing. “I find that having a website is 
y important in terms of promoting myself in the same 
,Way\that going to conferences is," Williams said. “The first

Guest lecturer Martin Kersels discusses larger works
Last week, the School of Art Lecture Series brought to 
campus Martin Kersels, an artist working In performance, 
photography, audio, and sculpture. Kersels does not claim 
competency in any one medium; rather, he embraces the 
freedom and the idea of being an artist. "The world will 
respond [to my work] however they want,” Kersels said. "With 
a slap on the back, or derision.’’ While many of Kersels's 
works are individually exhibited pieces or performances, he 
spent his lecture elaborating on some of his larger works and 
installations.
Objects of the Dealer (1995) is a gallery installation that 
incorporates sound, performance, and sculpture into the 
space. Kersels pursued the idea of soundtrack throughout 
everyday life; he composed 14 different scores, each matching 
an object in his art dealer’s office. Kersels relocated his art 
dealer’s office into the gallery, and had his dealer go about 
his daily routine at his desk. Every object he used caused a 
different soundtrack to play. For example, a telephone was 
linked to a speaker system, and the “telephone score” played 
whenever it was in use. Here, the performance created an 
ever-changing sonic chaos in the gallery space, and Kersels 
was able to emphasize how pecpple remember moments using 
music and sound.
Loud House, a metal shed with a TV monitor above its 
structure, deals primarily with sound. With the goal of 
creating what he called "a singular object of undeniable 
presence," Kersels videotaped himself clog dancing, his 
rhythm moving from soft to wild. The TV monitor shows 
the video of Kersels dancing, while eight speakers in the 
shed pounded out sound. The shed also held glass bottles 
with nails in them, which only added to the noise. Through 
all of this, Loud House accomplished its goal of creating an 
“undeniable presence."
Kersels’s Pink Constellation (2000-2001) also combines video 
and installation. The piece includes a 20-minute video shot in 
a “tumble room” — a fanciful, rotating space where two actors 
move up the walls and on the ceiling. In the gallery space, 
one room showed the video, while the other room displayed a 
real-life tumble room in constant rotation, with the set pieces 
being violently tossed and broken as if in a giant rock grinder. 
The juxtaposition in Kersels’s piece shows that fantasy is 
light and airy, while reality is brutish. With all the difficulties 
he faced in the creation and execution of Pink Constellation, 
Kersels decided that he no longer wanted to create such large 
projects.
Orchestra for Idiots (2005), Kersels’s recent installation, is by 
far one of his most interesting works. Fascinated by noise, 
Kersels created a series of 18 mechanisms based on books 
from the ’40s and '50s on how to make radio sound effects.
For example, to make the sound of rain, he used a cylinder 
with beans and rice in it. Kersels added orchestra-style 
portraits of people holding his invented instruments, thus 
making them look more legitimate. Finally, he composed a 
score that integrated each mechanism, which he conducted 
with a ping-pong paddle and horsewhip. The installation was 
relatively whimsical, with sound as its crucial element, using 
cruder tonalities to portray real-life events and actions.
Kersels’s work is both humorous and engaging. Whether 
interactive or not, the viewer is pulled in by the sonic 
elements as well as by the association with the sculptural 
objects. Kersels's versatility pervades his works, and becomes 
increasingly important in his ability to create work that 
connects with the viewer.

In 1489, Leonardo da Vinci dissected human corpses in 
an effort to better his art and anatomic drawings. Though 
famous for this effort, da Vinci was not the first or last 
person to do so. Today, scientists still strive to understand 
the human form through various methods, including the 
dissection of cadavers. The human body, an intensely 
complex structure, has remained something of a mystery 
for years; new questions arise with every new finding. 
BODIES... The Exhibition, at the Carnegie Science Center, 
seeks to showcase the intricacies of the human body.
To that end, BODIES... features preserved bodies, dissected 
to show different parts of the human body. The exhibit features 
bodies playing tennis, kicking a soccer ball, conducting 
an orchestra, and more. There is also a circulatory exhibit 
where the human form is entirely composed of capillaries, 
veins, and arteries, all lit with lights.
BODIES... has caused worldwide controversy since it 
opened in 2005. Elaine Catz, an 11 -year employee at the 
Science Center, resigned in reaction to the exhibit. She 
claimed that the bodies had unknown origins, and that it was 
immoral to use them. Many political and religious activists 
have also spoken out against the exhibit, condemning 
the use of corpses for public entertainment. BODIES... 
incorporates embryos and fetuses from 9- to 32-week 
gestation periods, which has caused many to feel strongly 
against the exhibit as well.
“It may be upsetting to people to see bodies being treated 
more as scientific exhibits than as people,” said chemical 
engineering professor Kris Noel Dahl. “I can understand 
this point of view. Given the wealth of different cultures and 
diversity of beliefs in the U.S., it is very likely that some will 
be offended.”
Despite much controversy, BODIES... has drawn millions of 
visitors all over the world. "I think that we all have fascination 
about the way things work,” Dahl said. “One thing that 
everyone has in common is that they have a body.”

This Dodge Viper is part of last Saturday's "Cars at Carnegie," Carnegie 
Mellon's first annual auto show, which benefited the American Red 
Cross. The show featured food, a DJ, and, of course, cars: imports, 
classic muscle cars, and new dealership cars.The cars were on display 
at Morewood parking lot — a nice change from the usual SUVs and 
minivans.
