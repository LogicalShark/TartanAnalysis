Incoming president Subra Suresh visits campus
MADELYN GLYMOUR
Contributing Editor
Carnegie Mellon welcomed 
President-Elect Subra Suresh 
and his family with pomp and 
circumstance on Thursday 
night, with a series of speeches 
in McConomy Auditorium and 
a reception in Rangos Hall.
The speakers, introduced 
by a bagpiper, included outgo-
ing university President Jared 
Cohon, chairman of the Board 
of Trustees Ray Lane, and Will 
Weiner, senior economics and 
statistics and decision science 
double major and student body 
president. Suresh spoke last.
The bulk of Cohon’s and 
Lane’s speeches addressed the 
process by which the search 
committee found and selected 
Suresh as the university’s next 
president.
In addition to thanking the 
presidential search committee, 
Lane told the story of the Board 
of Trustees’ ?rst discussion 
two years ago about who they 
wanted for the university’s 
next president.
“If anyone had told me back 
then that the process would go 
as well as it went for the last 
two years, I just would not have 
believed them,” Lane said. 
“I’ve been around the track 
too many times to know that 
things go as planned. But this 
went pretty much as planned, 
and I give a lot of credit, if not 
all the credit, to the search 
committee.”
Suresh, who is the current 
director of the National Sci-
ence Foundation and former 
dean of the school of engineer-
ing at the Massachusetts Insti-
tute of Technology, said that 
his ?rst action upon taking of-
?ce will be to go on a “listening 
tour” of the university.
“I’m looking forward to 
holding many open forums, lis-
tening to students, faculty, and 
staff, to get [the] very different 
perspectives that exist in a uni-
versity like this,” Suresh said.
The students, faculty, and 
staff who attended the event 
seemed to come away with a 
sense of optimism.
“[I’m excited about] the fact 
that he is so positive and for-
ward thinking, and is excited 
to be here and be part of our 
community and get to know 
us,” said lighting design profes-
sor Cindy Limauro. 
“I think his past record has 
proven that he is a good leader 
and will be somebody that I 
think will command respect 
from the faculty, the students, 
and the staff, and will go on 
this journey with us.” 
Weiner shared Limauro’s 
enthusiasm for Suresh, with 
whom he got to speak person-
ally during the preparations for 
the event.
“Clearly on paper he’s 
amazing, but he’s [also] a re-
ally great guy,” Weiner said. 
“Just chatting with him, he’s 
really approachable, really 
down to earth, and has a really

The nature of higher 
education, as well as 
potential strategies to 
improve and facilitate 
learning at the university 
level, were key topics of 
discussion at the lecture 
“Between Academia and 
Activism: a Roundtable 
on Reforming American 
Higher Education.”
The event, hosted last 
Thursday in Baker Hall’s 
Swank Room (255B), 
started with presentations 
from a five-member panel 
and ended with a round-
table discussion on the 
state of higher education 
in America. 
The Swank Room was 
crowded for this event, 
and the small classroom’s 
round-table format suited 
the discussion-based na-
ture of the panel.
The first speaker was 
Carolyn Commer, a Ph.D. 
candidate in rhetoric. 
Commer’s talk, titled 
“Educating for Citizen-
ship: the Possibilities 
and Pitfalls of the Civic 
Frame for Higher Educa-
tion,” focused on the role 
of citizens and the public 
sphere in higher education 
reform.

Hacking culture breaking into campus
ALVIN MATHEW
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon has seen 
a new wave of students con-
tributing to “hacking” cul-
ture over the course of recent 
years. 
One campus club that has 
contributed to this trend is 
Make CMU, a hacking-based 
organization that encourages 
students to “make things with 
computers,” according to the 
group’s website. 
Organizations such as 
Make CMU are now focused 
on this ?eld to further growth, 
support, and space for hack-
ing on campus. 
They are also trying in-
crease diversity by searching 
for students outside tradition-
al technical majors and merg-
ing the technological and cre-
ative portions of the student 
body. 
Senior computer science 
major Amy Quispe noticed 
that “in the last two-and-a 
half years, things have been 
changing a lot here,” as more 
students have developed a 
heightened interest in things 
like “hacker spaces, hacker 
groups, and the Internet.”
As a result, in 2011, Quispe 
founded ScottyLabs. Initially 
a personal side project, the 
project has since become a 
student-run group. 
According to its website, 
ScottyLabs strives to “use 
technical expertise to promote 
innovation in practical ways.” 
ScottyLabs is involved in a 
number of different projects, 
including developing an appli-
cation programming interface 
to store educational data for 
Carnegie Mellon and schools 
throughout the country. 
ScottyLabs is also responsi-
ble for the creation and orga-
nization of TartanHacks, the 
highly successful and well-at-
tended hackathon that takes 
place annually on campus. 
It also heads SkillSwap 
Weekend, an event held on 
the fourth ?oor of the Gates 
Hillman Complex that “teach-
es people things they wish 
they knew.”
Quispe said, “People were 
trying to make things, but 
were [prohibited from doing 
so].”
 She noted that ScottyLabs’ 
main goal is to provide stu-
dents the opportunity of “be-
ing empowered to turn ideas 
into code.” 
According to Quispe, “stu-
dents at CMU have what they 
need to get started on side 
products and get skills and 
students they need to build 
truly great things.” 
Quispe believes that 
ScottyLabs should not be 
about a major, but about mak-
ing goals and ideas come to 
fruition.
Along with launching 
the activities described be-
fore, ScottyLabs now leads 
Make CMU sessions.
 These sessions, during 
which students take time to 
help each other with ideas, 
take place every Saturday 
from 2–6 p.m. in the Studio 
for Creative Inquiry in the Col-
lege of Fine Arts Building .
Another student organi-
zation on campus looking to 
capitalize on the developing 
“hacker” culture is the Com-
puter Club.

jor, noted the Computer 
Club focuses on work with 
Students team up for Rwandan kids
LAUREN WILLIAMS
Junior Staffwriter
A group of Carnegie Mel-
lon students is devoted to 
improving life for school-
children in Rwanda. Project 
Rwanda, a service initiative 
founded in 2010, recently be-
gan recruiting students for an 
upcoming trip to Rwanda. 
This group partnered 
with One Laptop Per Child 
(OLPC), a nonpro?t organi-
zation that offers inexpen-
sive laptops to children in 
developing countries. OLPC 
has distributed 110,000 lap-
tops to children in Rwanda; 
however, many of these lap-
tops go unused due to a lack 
of understanding of the tech-
nology. 
Project Rwanda teaches 
primary school students in 
Kigali, Rwanda, how to use 
these laptops through classes 
in programming, typing, and 
creative thinking.
Alexander Rothera, a se-
nior ?ne art and human and 
computer interaction double 
major and member of the 
Project Rwanda team, de-
scribed his visit to Rwanda. 
“There was this really incred-
ible moment when we ?rst 
got there, and they had this 
giant padlock on the storage 
closet that they opened up. 
And then he opens the door, 
and there’s a mound of lap-
tops covered in dust. They 
were brand new, and no one 
had opened them. The school 
that we went to had 400 lap-
tops unused.”
During their visit, the 
Carnegie Mellon students 
were able to put all 400 lap-
tops into use. Many of these 
Rwandan students had nev-
er used a computer before. 
Through the help of talented 
translators, the Carnegie 
Mellon students taught them 
simple gestures, such as left 
clicking and right clicking. 
They instructed students 
in programming by having 
them play logic games and 
also encouraged students to 
use their creativity through 
acting and public speaking 
classes.
Senior global studies ma-
jor and Project Rwanda team 
member Sara Faradji worked 
with Rwandan students in 
drama classes. 
Faradji said, “There is no 
?ne arts education in Rwan-
da. They don’t do music or 
drama. They don’t have the-
aters. It’s a very timid society 
… they’re all wearing their 
little uniforms, and are very 
respectful. I wanted them to 
be more con?dent: talk in 
front of their peers, be more 
creative. It was great to see 
how they started out really 
shy in the beginning, and 
then as they started warming 
up, they became much more 
lively and were really excited 
to show their work.”
The Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents were only able to work 
with two grades of Rwandan 
students in a single primary 
school and were unable to 
connect with the teachers on 
summer break. 
In order to reach out to 
more students, Project Rwan-
da is working to expand its 
program.
When this project was ini-
tiated, it was unforeseen that 
a Carnegie Mellon campus 
would be started in Rwanda.

good idea of how he can work 
with students and how he can 
make this place better.”
Student Body Vice Presi-
dent of Finance Jon Mark, who 
met with Suresh and the other 
presidential candidates when 
they visited the university 
prior to the Board of Trustees’ 
decision, agreed.
“He was a really great guy 
from the get-go,” Mark said. 
“He answered our questions 
really candidly and honestly, 
and I think that he was a really 
clear choice for a president. 
He’s going to push the univer-
sity in a really great direction.”
Both Weiner and Mark 
stressed the importance of a 
good relationship between the 
president and students.
“I urge next year’s students 
to work with him, just help him 
understand how the student 
process works and really make 
sure to establish that relation-
ship early on,” Weiner said.
Mark hoped that Suresh 
would make sure to remember 
students.
“One of the biggest things 
that I would encourage him to 
do is to really make sure that 
as a president, he’s going to 
prioritize the student experi-
ence,” Mark said.
 “I think that right now he’s 
going to push this university in 
a lot of great ways, but I think 
that it can’t be forgotten that 
there are people here for four 
years, that it means a lot to 
them that they have a presi-
dent that … [will] really make 
sure that it’s the best experi-
ence it can be.”
Suresh spoke of his upcom-
ing tenure as president with 
excitement. 
“As I get to know this com-
munity better, I’m con?dent 
that we have a common mis-
sion and a common goal. We 
all very ?rmly believe that 
Carnegie Mellon is a great 
institution. But we also ?rmly 
believe that Carnegie Mellon 
is an institution that has all 
the ingredients and potential 
for much greater greatness. 
I very much look forward to 
working with you to achieve 
that,” he said. 
Normalization and the Fu-
ture of Higher Education;” he 
listed 15 major problems that 
he sees in higher education 
and proposed a plan for sys-
temic change. Sowards’ list 
of problems with higher edu-
cation ranged from climbing 
student debt levels to the 
treatment of underpaid ad-
junct faculty.
“All of these problems are 
interconnected, in the sense 
that they’re all causally re-
lated,” Sowards said. 
“And it also forms a cycle. 
At any point you enter it, 
you can always cycle back to 
some other point — there’s 
no point at which it termi-
nates. Now, that cyclical 
property is bad; since things 
are causally related, once a 
single problem is exacerbat-
ed it further exacerbates all 
the other problems,” he said.
Heather Steffen, a Ph.D. 
candidate in literary and 
cultural studies, called her 
presentation “The Ph.D. 
Vampire Squid,” a play on an 
essay over 100 years old by 
Harvard philosopher William 
James, “The Ph.D. Octopus.” 
James’ essay discussed the 
problems with the Ph.D. pro-
grams in American colleges 
in 1903, when the essay was 
published. 
Steffen, similarly, talked 
about the problems with 
modern Ph.D. programs, rec-
ommending changes like sti-
pends for graduate students 
closer to the current living 
wage.
Steffen is also a member 
of the Modern Language As-
sociation’s (MLA) Commit-
tee on the Status of Graduate 
Students in the Profession. 
The committee, accord-
ing to the MLA website, “will 
consider a range of curricu-
lar, intellectual, and profes-
sional issues that affect grad-
uate students in language 
and literature.”
“With average doctoral 
time to degree at nine-and-
a-half years, and a labor sys-
tem in which 75 percent of 
college teachers will never 
be eligible for tenure, and 
a tenure-track job market 
whose bottom dropped out 
in the ’70s, and the ’80s, and 
the ’90s, and in 2008, hu-
manities graduate education 
seems to be, as [MLA Presi-
dent] Michael F. Bérubé puts 
it, a ‘seamless garment of cri-
sis,’ ” Steffen said.
The next panelist, profes-
sor of English and literary 
cultural studies Jeffrey Wil-
liams, gave a presentation 
titled “Proper Recognition.” 
Williams discussed a 
handout showing rising aver-
age student debt compared 
with inflation, and a list of 
the top 100 highest univer-
sity endowments.
According to Williams, 
the inflated tuition at most 
universities is caused by 
widespread privatization, 
and universities’ refusal to 
spend their endowments.
The last panelist to speak 
was Jess Wilton, a Ph.D. can-
didate in literary and cultur-
al studies. 
Wilton called her talk 
“The Saxifrage School: Dis-
ruptive Innovation beyond 
Neoliberalism.” 
Wilton’s title references 
the Saxifrage School, de-
scribed on its website as a 
“higher education laboratory 
working to lower costs, re-
think the campus, and recon-
cile disciplines.”
The Saxifrage School, 
Wilton said, follows a model 
of “disruptive innovation,” 
a term coined by Harvard 
economist Clayton Chris-
tensen. Although Chris-
tensen applied the term to 
big business, Wilton wants to 
apply it to higher education, 
as modeled by the Saxifrage 
School.
After the panelists had 
finished their presentations, 
the audience, comprised 
mostly of graduate students 
in the English department, 
put forward their own ques-
tions and opinions.
Sheila Liming, a Ph.D. 
candidate in literary and cul-
tural studies in attendance at 
the panel, said that the dis-
cussion “represents the idea 
that problems with univer-
sities are systemic in a large 
way, and the answers are go-
ing to be systemic in a large 
way too. Solutions are going 
to be systemic, meaning that 
you can’t fix any one level. 
You can’t just fix undergrad-
uate education; you can’t just 
target the graduate level or 
even labor issues, you have 
to look at the whole picture.”
David Haeselin, another 
Ph.D. candidate in literary 
and cultural studies, was 
glad that the panelists ad-
dressed the issue of labor in 
the university setting. 
“I’m glad to see that la-
bor was first and foremost; 
everyone was addressing it 
in some way or another…. It 
was great to get a community 
conversation in an interdisci-
plinary setting.”
“infrastructure that’s useful 
for student activities.” 
According to Sam Gruber, 
the club’s co-president and ju-
nior BCSA student in comput-
er science and architecture, 
members of the club meet in 
Cyert Hall and collaborate on 
a number of projects, includ-
ing creating various demos 
and providing services for 
entities and campus functions 
like TartanHacks.
With steadily increasing 
attendance, organizations 
such as ScottyLabs and the 
Computer Club are interest-
ed in being given additional 
space to do work.
Preseau, for instance, not-
ed that his club often has to 
work in the hallway, which 
leads to obvious dif?culties. 
Bryan Wade, senior eco-
nomics major, is particularly 
interested in the expansion of 
this culture.
With plans for a new Uni-
versity Center design in the 
future, Wade, Quispe, and 
other students of Make CMU 
said they would ideally like 
to have a space designated in 
the building for their organi-
zations. 
Wade elaborated that 
“there are already spaces, but 
there’s no software.” Talks are 
still considered exploratory 
and in the preliminary stage 
of discussion; several groups 
have been trying to secure an 
area. 
Quispe hopes a future 
space in the University Center 
would also host peer educa-
tion programs.
Nonetheless, group mem-
bers think that more can be 
done to increase involvement 
of students in other majors. 
Wade noted that “a lot of 
people are intimidated by it 
and are scared off by people 
who are not receptive.” 
Quispe thinks some people 
are hesitant when they hear 
the word “hacker” because 
over time it has developed 
an unfriendly connotation to 
people outside the hacking 
community. 
Quispe is glad that design 
students, in particular, have 
been drawn to ScottyLabs, but 
at the same time is looking to  
appeal to others who can con-
tribute.
Preseau believes people 
have an “interest in what we 
do, particularly in collabora-
tive hacking,” but that many 
think twice about joining. 
“We really want to do more 
outreach to other colleges,” 
Preseau said. 
He added that the orga-
nization is looking for more 
people, particularly those in-
terested in computational art. 
Similarly, Quispe looks 
to spread the word to that 
weekly Make CMU meetings 
are open to all, regardless of 
major. 
In the future, organiza-
tions like ScottyLabs and the 
Computer Club hope to fur-
ther expand while bringing 
together students of varying 
degrees and interests.
Carnegie Mellon Pittsburgh’s 
Project Rwanda is now hop-
ing to partner with both the 
campuses in Qatar and Rwan-
da to grow the program and 
develop a continuous pres-
ence among Rwandan prima-
ry school students.
 This summer, Project 
Rwanda is hoping to send 
eight to 10 students each 
from the Pittsburgh and Qatar 
campuses to Rwanda for two 
to three weeks. Interviews are 
currently being conducted to 
select the group of students 
from Pittsburgh.
Goals of the project in-
clude establishing a Mentor-
Mentee program between 
Carnegie Mellon Rwanda 
graduate students and local 
youths; launching a One Day 
Summer Reunion for children 
who have participated in the 
program since 2010; and us-
ing cross-campus video con-
ferencing to connect youths 
from Rwanda, Qatar, and 
Pittsburgh.
Rwanda is often associat-
ed with war and genocide, so 
many question why Rwanda 
was chosen as the site of the 
project. 
However, Rwanda is also 
one of the fastest-developing 
African countries. 
Rwanda was the ?rst coun-
try in which women were 
the majority of those elect-
ed to serve in the national 
legislature. 
Efforts are also being 
made to sustain electricity 
coverage and to provide a na-
tional communication ?ber-
optic network to 30 districts. 
The Rwanda Ministry of Edu-
cation outlines a priority of 
“making post-basic education 
more accessible and more rel-
evant to our national needs.”
“Maybe [the children] can 
one day go to a school like 
CMU in Rwanda. It’s some-
thing that no one has heard 
of before, and something that 
the president of Rwanda re-
ally supports. Part of his ini-
tiative is rebuilding Rwanda 
after the years of genocide 
through technological educa-
tion,” Faradji said.
Rothera added that it’s im-
portant to look at “the great 
things that can happen in 
the country, and how incred-
ible the students are at learn-
ing—basically, the potential 
for such a small country. They 
have great plans and lead-
ership for how to move for-
ward.”
Both Faradji and Rothera 
are planning to stay involved 
with Project Rwanda after 
graduating from Carnegie 
Mellon this spring.

CyLab seeks to map poisonous plants for better treatment
DESIREE XU
Staffwriter
“If you call the Poison Con-
trol Center and say: ‘I’ve eaten 
a poisonous plant, help me,’ 
they basically go through ?ve 
volumes of books to ?gure out 
what you’ve eaten.”
These are the words of 
Marios Savvides, an associate 
research professor of electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing and the director of the 
CyLab Biometrics Center. 
Savvides and Cynthia Mor-
ton, the head of the Carnegie 
Museum of Natural History’s 
botany department, are devel-
oping a single digital database 
for identifying all poisonous 
plants. This database will aid 
in the treatment of hikers or 
passers-by who suffer from 
symptoms after coming in con-
tact with poisonous plants.
The two researchers had 
known of each other before 
this project: Morton knew that 
Savvides had worked with fa-
cial recognition, so she want-
ed to apply that capability to 
a project involving plants. The 
result will be a smartphone 
app that that can identify a 
plant based on its appearance 
and provide the plant’s toxic-
ity, symptoms that appear af-
ter contact, and remedies for 
treatment. From just a snap-
shot, the app will be able to 
detect anything from a weed 
on the side of a hiking trail 
to potted houseplants bought 
from Home Depot.
The bene?ts of the app are 
far-reaching. “It is bene?cial 
for kids because there are 
common plants at home that 
can pose as health hazards for 
any kids or animals that swal-
low it,” Morton said. Addition-
ally, the bene?ts of the app can 
be extended to the medical 
community.
The two scientists have col-
laborated with the University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center 
(UPMC) and the Poison Con-
trol Center, which currently 
use a medical toxicology book 
and the Micromedics data-
base, UPMC’s medical data-
base for poisonous plants. 
The current system is missing 
60 percent of its database, 
including symptoms and im-
ages. Therefore, doctors are 
only able to recall information 
about each plant, but cannot 
immediately recognize a plant 
from a victim’s symptoms. This 
inef?cient process of scruti-
nizing plant references delays 
the time required for optimal 
treatment.
From the medical toxicol-
ogy books’ and Micromedic’s 
combined database, Morton 
and Savvides are able to mine 
out the 32 most commonly re-
ported plants. As of right now, 
the app is only able to detect 
10 of those plants, but the two 
are expanding the app data-
base to allow it to recognize 
dangers beyond the 32.
“For many plants — some 
massive, some poisonous, or 
both — this is a good tracking 
mechanism to see what’s go-
ing on because a lot of these 
are not native to here. So, it’s 
giving us a wealth of informa-
tion on a variety of different 
levels,” Morton said.
Soon the app will be able 
to detect the location of a 
poisonous plant and update 
the information on an online 
social networking system. Be-
fore advancement to the next 
step, the two scientists need to 
wait for UPMC’s approval on 
the proposal to fund the rest 
of the project. In addition, pa-
tients have also requested for 
the app to include certain poi-
sonous mushrooms and hallu-
cinogens.
So far, Morton concluded 
that the toughest part of the 
project involved hand col-
lecting live specimens of the 
plants, organizing them by 
different colors and features, 
and taking 50 to 100 pictures 
of the same plant from differ-
ent angles to help the app to 
recognize it.
Funding for the project 
came from the UPMC Health-
care Innovation Technology 
Grant program, which is a col-
laboration between Carnegie 
Mellon and UPMC. During 
the project, the two scientists 
also enjoyed learning more 
about the other’s specializa-
tion. Above all, they are proud 
to come up with a product that 
helps people.

Fire: mankind’s greatest 
invention, or worst enemy? 
According to the U.S. Fire Ad-
ministration, ?re kills roughly 
3,500 Americans each year 
and injures over 17,000 more. 
These numbers are higher 
than those resulting from any 
other force of nature. At the 
same time, it provides heat 
and is used to cook food need-
ed for human survival, among 
countless other familiar ben-
e?ts. Debates aside, one may 
ponder: How does this seem-
ingly simple yet powerful phe-
nomenon work?
Fire, put simply, is a con-
version process. It takes some 
material (wood, paper, a ciga-
rette) and rapidly converts it 
to simpler, lighter materials 
(carbon dioxide, carbon mon-
oxide, smoke). When set on 
?re, millions of carefully or-
ganized molecules that make 
up a piece of wood are broken 
down into a mess of smoke.
Three main ingredients 
go into making a ?re: oxy-
gen, heat, and fuel — the 
absence of just one of these 
makes ?re’s existence impos-
sible. Take, for example, a 
piece of paper as the fuel. An 
extremely hot piece of paper 
will not burn in outer space 
— there is no oxygen (all of 
those Star Wars special effects 
are scienti?cally inaccurate). 
The piece of paper won’t just 
erupt into ?ames sitting on 
your desk, either; there is not 
enough heat.
A seemingly silly but com-
plex question then arises: 
Why does ?re need heat? It 
turns out that oxygen, one of 
the three main ingredients in 
?re, is extremely stable; it will 
not react with anything unless 
it has enough energy to do so. 
Heat, then, is the supplier 
of energy to oxygen. Once 
enough energy is available, 
oxygen can start reacting with 
the fuel, igniting a ?ame and 
starting the ?re.
One common way of cre-
ating the necessary heat is 
through friction. Take, for 
example, the striking of a 
match — the friction involved 
in this motion creates enough 
heat at the interface between 
the match and the matchbox 
so that oxygen can now be-
gin reacting with the match 
head (the fuel), thus creat-
ing a ?ame. The ?ame from 
the match can then be used to 
transfer heat to another fuel 
to be set on ?re.
Not all materials make 
good fuels, though. In gen-
eral, materials that contain 
an abundance of carbon and 
hydrogen are ?ammable. The 
liquid fuel inside of a lighter is 
usually butane, which is en-
tirely made up of carbon and 
hydrogen. On the ?ip side, 
water has plenty of hydrogen 
but zero carbon; there’s a rea-
son ?re?ghters love using it.
The ?ames of a ?re con?rm 
that a fuel has been set ablaze. 
The ?ames themselves are 
actually made of vapors and 
particles that are so hot that 
they light up — just as a ?la-
ment inside an incandescent 
light bulb does. If the ?ame 
is colored yellow-orange, it is 
mostly made up of tiny soot 
particles and burns at about 
1,800°F. A bluish ?ame burns 
even hotter. In this case, the 
?ame is blue because a hot-
ter ?re produces less soot 
(so, less yellow-orange) and 
more gas molecules, which 
tend to burn blue. As these 
particles and molecules get 
further away from the center 
of the ?ame, they cool down 
and cease to glow, creating an 
edge to the ?ame.
An extremely important 
characteristic of ?re is that it 
is self-perpetuating. That is, 
?re creates its own heat to 
sustain itself. There is plenty 
of fuel around us, and cer-
tainly a lot of oxygen, but 
things aren’t spontaneously 
erupting into ?ames. This ar-
guably makes heat the most 
important of the three ingre-
dients. A strong source of heat 
is all it takes, so an action as 
simple as ?icking a smolder-
ing cigarette out a car window 
can easily ignite massive for-
est ?res that destroy millions 
of acres of land.
Editor’s Note: Daniel Tkacik, 
a Ph.D. candidate in civil and 
environmental engineering,

searching ?re and smoke in the

tory in Missoula, Montana.

When faced with a dif-
?cult decision, we often opt 
to give our minds a break, 
and take a fresh look at the 
problem afterward. However, 
recent research by Carnegie 
Mellon assistant professor of 
psychology J. David Creswell 
and alumnus James Bursley 
shows that we have been un-
der a misconception about the 
way we approach decision-
making.
Creswell and Bursley’s 
research shows that we un-
consciously process decision-
making information. Even 
while we are consciously 
distracted, the parts of the 
brain involved in decision-
making — namely the visual 
and prefrontal cortices — are 
still active. The ?ndings were 
published in the journal So-
cial Cognitive and Affective 
Neuroscience.
Creswell, Bursley, and Ajay 
Satpute of Northeastern Uni-
versity performed a study on 
27 adults. “In our study, we 
presented participants with 
four different items under dif-
ferent categories,” Bursley ex-
plained via email. 
The participants were 
presented with 12 attributes 
about the items in random or-
der, and were informed that 
they had to make decisions 
about the quality of the items. 
As a control group, some peo-
ple were asked to make deci-
sions about each item’s qual-
ity immediately after being 
presented with the informa-
tion. Others were distracted 
for two minutes before being 
asked to reach their decision. 
Those that underwent the 
two-minute distraction pe-
riod were also subject to neu-
roimaging through an MRI 
scanner during the process. 
The images revealed that the 
prefrontal and visual cortices 
were active even though par-
ticipants were not focused on 
making a decision.
“When people are initially 
learning information — say, 
about different cars — a set 
of brain regions is active and 
is carrying out this initial 
learning, which psycholo-
gists call ‘encoding,’ ” Bursley 
explained. “What we found is 
that some of the same brain 
regions reactivate — while 
people are performing the 
unrelated distracter task — in 
order to support continued 
unconscious processing of the 
initial information about cars.” 
The items were described 
to the participants such that 
there was one that was ob-
jectively the best, two that 
were of medium quality, and 
one that was objectively the 
worst. The results of the study 
showed that participants who 
made the decision after a two-
minute distraction were bet-
ter able to perceive this dif-
ference than those who made 
immediate decisions. 
“This isn’t so surprising,” 
Bursley said. “The distracter 
task allows time for addi-
tional cognitive processing 
to occur, even though this 
processing happens outside 
of conscious awareness and 
people have no idea it’s going 
on….It seems that this uncon-
scious processing reorganizes 
and weight information, and 
this is probably part of what 
leads to people’s better deci-
sion making.”
Though the study made 
clear why decisions after un-
conscious processing were 
better than immediate deci-
sions, it was not completely 
clear why unconscious pro-
cessing was better than con-
scious processing. According 
to Bursley, one possibility 
was that conscious processing 
could make people mentally 
overwhelm themselves, and 
therefore make poorer deci-
sions. “Whatever the reason, 
we see unconscious process-
ing doing better than con-
scious thought,” he said. 
Bursley graduated in 2012 
with a bachelor’s of science 
in psychology and a minor in 
philosophy. He began work-
ing with Creswell during his 
?rst year at Carnegie Mellon. 
Bursley assisted with data 
analysis and ran participants 
through experiments in Cre-
swell’s lab. The two soon 
began exploring the possibil-
ity of using brain imaging to 
study unconscious process-
ing in decision-making. “After 
a number of false starts, we 
eventually found an approach 
that worked, which is the one 
we describe in our current pa-
per,” Bursley said. 
Since the same parts of the 
brain involved in decision-
making are also involved in 
learning, Bursley and Cre-
swell hope to investigate the 
role of unconscious process-
ing in learning to see if it has a 
similar bene?cial role. “We’re 
hoping to eventually apply 
our ?ndings to real-world 
educational settings: We 
might be able to apply things 
we learn about how the brain 
unconsciously processes in-
formation to the classroom, 
leveraging our laboratory 
and neuroimaging research 
to help students learn better 
and improve educational out-
comes,” Bursley said.Michael Setzer/SciTech Editor

CMU physics professors shed light on dark matter
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
One of the greatest mys-
teries of our world is the ac-
celerated expansion of the 
universe. If you threw a ball 
up in the air, you would expect 
it to fall back down because of 
gravity. For the same reason, 
one would expect that gravity 
would slow down the expan-
sion of the universe. So what 
is making it speed up instead?
A well-known theory to 
explain this phenomenon 
involves a force called dark 
energy, which mysteriously 
repels gravity. While the exis-
tence of this force is generally 
accepted, no one has a solid 
understanding of what it actu-
ally is.
Carnegie Mellon assistant 
physics professors Shirley 
Ho and Rachel Mandelbaum 
have recently been selected 
to participate in the European 
Space Agency’s (ESA) Euclid 
mission, a survey that aims to 
uncover the secrets of dark en-
ergy and dark matter. Euclid 
will feature a 1.2-meter space 
telescope that will observe 
two billion galaxies in one-
third of the sky. The portion of 
the sky that was chosen is cur-
rently being observed by vari-
ous ground telescopes. Since 
space telescopes are very cost-
ly, Euclid will minimize its ob-
servations in space to comple-
ment data that is being taken 
from the ground.
“There are two ways that 
people like to make cosmo-
logical measurements,” ex-
plained Mandelbaum. “One 
way is to look at distance 
measurements and how they 
change with time. The other 
way is looking at the growth of 
cosmological structures with 
time.”
The ?rst method — observ-
ing how distance measure-
ments change directly with 
time — is related to Ho’s work 
with baryon acoustic oscilla-
tions (BAO). BAO are periodic 
?uctuations in the density of 
the baryonic matter (protons 
and neutrons) of the universe 
that are caused by sound 
waves from the early universe. 
The early universe consisted 
of a plasma made of electrons, 
protons, and neutrons that 
photons were unable to trav-
el through; this trapping of 
photons created pressure dif-
ferences in the density of the 
universe.
As the universe expanded 
and cooled, photons were able 
to move around freely, reliev-
ing the pressure from before 
and leaving behind a ripple of 
baryonic matter that can be 
observed in the present con-
?guration of galaxies. “BAO 
only affect a small percent of 
the current universe,” Ho said. 
“Therefore, you need a very 
large volume of the universe 
before you can measure it.” 
With Euclid’s data, Ho will use 
BAO as a standard cosmologi-
cal ruler — an astronomical 
structure — to determine how 
far away galaxies are, how 
they are accelerating away 
from us, and consequently, 
how the universe is expand-
ing.
Mandelbaum’s research 
focuses more on the second 
method: She uses weak gravi-
tational lensing to learn how 
matter in the universe clumps 
together due to gravity. “Grav-
itational lensing is the de?ec-
tion of light by masses,” Man-
delbaum said. “We can think 
of mass as something that 
causes distortion in space-
time, so it changes the path 
that light will take.” 
For example, a galaxy that 
might actually be circular will 
appear elliptical in an image 
because the light from the 
galaxy is bent on its way to 
Earth. But how do we know if 
the image is being distorted by 
gravitational lensing or if that 
is simply the shape of the gal-
axy?
“For a given galaxy, you 
never know how much of the 
shape you’re seeing is due to 
lensing and how much is due 
to the intrinsic shape,” Man-
delbaum said. “But here’s the 
important thing to keep in 
mind: If we didn’t have lens-
ing and just looked at galaxy 
shapes, they would just be 
randomly oriented and not 
aligned with each other. But 
gravitational lensing causes 
shape distortions that are co-
herent across the sky, so you 
look for coherent patterns in 
the shapes and the random 
parts will just average out 
while the lensing distortions 
show up as the coherent pat-
terns.” This can be done by 
averaging images from many, 
many galaxies — which is why 
data from Euclid will be so 
valuable.
The Euclid satellite will 
not be launched until 2020, 
but there are many prepara-
tions that Ho and Mandel-
baum must make in the years 
to come. Trade-offs such as 
whether they should cover 
more area but look less at each 
point or cover a smaller area 
but look at each point longer 
must be considered. Sophis-
ticated image processing al-
gorithms will also be needed 
before collecting data.
Although it has been over 
a decade since we discovered 
that the universe was expand-
ing at an accelerated rate, dark 
energy has remained a pro-
found puzzle. The Euclid mis-
sion aims to explore the histo-
ry of our universe’s expansion 
and to ?nally shed light on the 
mystery of dark energy.

Calculations reveal ?nite universe life
Using the mass of the new-
ly discovered Higgs boson, 
physicists are able to claim 
that the universe is unstable.
Joseph Lykken, a theoreti-
cal physicist with the Fermi 
National Accelerator Labora-
tory in Batavia, Illinois, said, 
“A little bubble of what you 
might think of as an ‘alter-
native’ universe will appear 
somewhere and then it will 
expand out and destroy us.” 
Such an event is likely to 
unfold at the speed of light. 
However, Earth will be long 
gone before this catastrophe 
takes place. The sun is ex-
pected to burn out in approxi-
mately the next 4.5 billion 
years.

Tiny planet around similarly sized sun
NASA’s Kepler Mission has 
discovered a new planetary 
system containing the smallest 
planet orbiting a star similar to 
our sun. 
The planetary system, 
named Kepler-37, is 210 light-
years away in the constella-
tion Lyra, and consists of three 
planets orbiting a star that 
belongs to the same class as 
our sun. However, the star is 
slightly smaller and cooler.
The tiny planet, dubbed 
Kepler-37b, is rocky in compo-
sition, does not have an atmo-
sphere, and probably cannot 
support life as we know it. It 
is smaller in size than Mercury 
and is only slightly larger than 
our moon, which made its de-
tection a huge challenge

3-D printing to create a new ear
An arti?cial ear which 
looks, feels, and functions 
like a natural ear was created 
by Cornell University bioengi-
neers and physicians using 3-D 
printing techniques and inject-
able gel molds. This is a much 
better option than reconstruc-
tive surgeries, which are pain-
ful or involve prosthetics that 
don’t feel natural. 
The ?rst step is creating a 
digital 3-D image of the de-
sired human ear and print-
ing it out using a 3-D printer 
to make a mold. This mold is 
then injected with a high-den-
sity special collagen hydro-gel, 
which acts as a scaffold upon 
which cartilage cells can grow.
The entire ear can be grown 
in only a few days.

NASA con?rms ?rst drilled Mars rock
NASA’s Mars rover Curios-
ity has relayed images that 
con?rm that it has successfully 
collected the ?rst ever sample 
from the interior of a rock on 
another planet. On Feb. 8, the 
drill on Curiosity’s robotic arm 
took in the powder as it bored 
a two-and-a-half-inch hole 
into a target on Mars.
Transfer of the powdered 
rock sample into an open 
scoop was visible for the ?rst 
time in images received from 
the rover last Wednesday. This 
con?rmation represents a suc-
cess for the sampling team 
involved with the mission. 
The rover team plans to have 
Curiosity sieve the sample and 
deliver portions to analytical 
instruments inside the rover.

Tech companies hit by cyber attack
Microsoft was recently a 
victim of the same kind of 
Java-based cyber-attack that 
hit Apple, Facebook, and pos-
sibly Twitter earlier this year. 
Microsoft and Facebook main-
tain that no customer data was 
compromised.
Programmers within the 
targeted companies visited a 
website intended for mobile 
app developers, which had 
been hacked. This website 
then infected the computer 
through the web browser’s 
Java plugin and attempted to 
transmit data from the com-
puter back to the hackers. Ini-
tially, the malware targeted 
only Macs, although a Win-
dows PC version was also de-
tected at some point.

Researchers stop ?u from spreading 
Stephen Withers and his 
colleagues at the University 
of British Columbia have re-
cently found that a set of ex-
perimental drugs have treated 
the ?u in the some mice. The 
drug candidates are part of a 
class of medications known as 
2,3-di?uorosialic acids (DF-
SAs) and work by blocking an 
enzyme binding process that is 
needed for the virus to spread 
from cell to cell. Mice treated 
with the DFSAs had as good of 
a recovery as mice who were 
given a currently available 
drug. The drug candidates 
also worked against drug-re-
sistant strains of the ?u.

can kids possess, it is using com-
puters to navigate the world of the 
Internet. It’s strange to think how 
kids today grow up online — as you 
can tell from their detailed Face-
book timelines — while the older 
generations can barely ?gure out 
how to work a keyboard. However, 
senior citizens are relearning what’s 
groovy: Their grandkids are ready 
to use their computer skills to teach 
grandma and grandpa how to work 
Facebook, Twitter, and beyond.
Students from Mt. Lebanon’s 
Mellon Middle School in Pittsburgh 
are sharing their talents by teaching 
computer skills to the elderly after 
school. Once a week, kids volunteer 
for about an hour to explain Gmail 
and social media platforms to local 
senior citizens. The way I see it, it’s a 
win-win for both generations.
The most obvious victors in this 
situation are the senior citizens — 
after even a single lesson, grandma 
can log online. The elderly step 
away from class equipped to navi-
gate the Internet. They can discover 
holiday recipes or reconnect with 
old neighbors. They can surprise 
their children with emails, and their 
grandchildren with e-cards. 
In an age where online commu-
nication is the preferred means of 
connection, it is essential that every-
one has the skills to access this new 
method of interaction. What better 
way to learn about online communi-
cation than with the help of youths?
As rewarding of an experience 
this is for the elderly, it is equally 
bene?cial for the students. The mid-
dle school’s new program is a hands-
on way for young adolescents to 
give back to their community and to 
interact with a generation that they 
often do not — with the exception of 
their grandparents.
This new program is also a cre-
ative paradigm for other schools 
looking to get their students in-
volved. Neighboring schools should 
follow the lead of the Mt. Lebanon 
school to get their children involved 
with technology in a way that is ben-
e?cial to not only themselves, but 
to a wider audience. Mellon Middle 
School should be applauded for its 
creative way of teaching students 
about community involvement and 
technology through experience.
Technology moves quickly, and 
innovative practices are as impor-
tant as innovative technology. The 
new program at Mellon Middle 
School gives children a hands-on 
taste of what it means to be a leader; 
since the Internet is a tool younger 
people feel comfortable with, they 
can con?dently teach their elders 
how to use it. Middle school kids are 
rarely granted responsibilities; this 
program is a fun and easy way for 
them to take up that ?rst challenge.
New program promotes generational interaction

Attention; stop the presses, ev-
eryone. Blue Ivy Carter, the daugh-
ter of Beyoncé and Jay-Z, is reading. 
At only 13 months.
USA Today and The Huf?ngton 
Post both reported extensively on 
the child prodigy’s progress last 
week. She’s started talking, and 
with reading thrown into the mix, 
it’s only a matter of time until Blue 
Ivy actually takes over the world. 
She’s already got the greatest par-
ents ever in Beyoncé and Jay-Z, 
and has been in the spotlight more 
times than most celebrity babies, so 
there’s little to stop her.
Once Kim Kardashian and Kanye 
West’s baby is born, the two babies 
could team up and their world domi-
nation would be unavoidable. Imag-
ine the news coverage then: updates 
on the duo’s outings, their matching 
out?ts, whom they deem worthy to 
play with. Twitter might explode.
But, seriously, why is this news?
Granted, children usually start 
reading around the ?rst grade, ac-
cording to the children’s health sec-
tion on WebMD.com. So yes, Blue 
Ivy may be a prodigy, but my point 
still stands. She’s barely a year old 
and there have already been too 
many news stories chronicling her 
every moment; similarly, there have 
been a number of articles on the 
“Kimye” baby, who isn’t even born 
yet. All in all, it’s a bit ridiculous.
Celebrity news is a million-dollar 
franchise primarily because peo-
ple are obsessed with everything 
and anything celebrity related. In 
2012, People magazine had a cir-
culation of 3,637,633, Us Weekly 
had 1,964,446, and Entertainment 
Weekly had 1,781,315, according 
to the Alliance for Audited Media. 
Those circulation numbers couldn’t 
be supported if the magazines didn’t 
have a large net of loyal readership.
So, understandably, celebrities 
will ?ll the news cycles; it’s what the 
people seem to want. It’s a sad truth, 
but one that I can accept. What I 
can’t accept, though, is the trend of 
reporting on celebrity babies. I ?nd 
it unsettling and creepy.
Imagine what it took to get some 
of the stories we see on the news-
stands. The lengths to which these 
reporters and photographers go to 
get these stories is actually insane. 
There’s dedication and then there’s 
a violation of privacy and human de-
cency. Think about it: Would you re-
ally want your child’s every moment 
— from conception to birth to tod-
dler years — documented and circu-
lated among millions of people?
And, no, it does not matter that 
they are celebrities and “they signed 
up for this.” That argument is ?awed 
in and of itself. The mere fact that 
someone is famous does not give 
anyone the right to harass them, pry 
into their lives, follow them from 
store to store, or wait outside their 
house. Regardless of how you feel 
about celebrities and their right to 
privacy, their children did not sign 
up for this. They’re exactly that — 
children. It’s time to give them some 
space to grow into normal humans 
unscarred by the limelight (we all 
saw how Macaulay Culkin turned 
out — it wasn’t pretty). Go report on 
something that actually matters.

Leave celeb babies alone

First came the hamster dance, 
then Gangnam Style, and now the 
Harlem Shake. Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents performed the latest Internet 
dance sensation for a YouTube video 
as part of the growing trend of Har-
lem Shake videos.
While many people have become 
annoyed with the phenomenon, we 
applaud the members of the Carn-
egie Mellon community for having 
a little fun and participating in this 
bizarre pop culture phenomenon. 
Performed by celebrities such as 
T-Pain, Matt & Kim, and even Wayne 
Brady, the Harlem Shake has become 
a small but integral event in modern 
Internet culture.
On top of that, the Hunt Library 
location was well selected, adding a 
sense of irony for viewers acquainted 
with Carnegie Mellon. Not only did 
the stunt provide the third ?oor — 
also known as the quiet ?oor — with 
the most fun it has seen in years, it 
also paid homage to the library’s sa-
tirical nickname “Club Hunt.”
Additionally, the ridiculous cos-
tumes (or lack thereof) that students 
wore — including a chicken suit, 
a banana, and the campus mascot, 
the Scotty dog — were welcome ad-
ditions to the video; they are sure 
to elicit a few laughs and a sense of 
pride from some members of the 
community.
This activity was well implement-
ed despite its spontaneity and the 
short time organizers had to ?nd in-
terested parties.
We hope that this trend of quirky 
campus activities — including Zom-
bie Runs hosted by Alternative 
Breaks and Donut Dash run by SAE 
— does not die out, as we foresee 
will happen with the hype surround-
ing the Harlem Shake.
Rather, we encourage students to 
continue participating in activities 
that bring them into contact with 
people they would not otherwise 
meet during their weekly routines 
on campus.
After all, college is about the ex-
periences with your fellow peers and 
the surrounding staff; what better 
way to create bonds than to partici-
pate in activities that automatically 
create a sense of community and ca-
maraderie?
Since the 2002–03 academic year, 
the No Child Left Behind Act tied fed-
eral school funding to student perfor-
mances on standardized state tests. 
Now, the ?rst students to have their 
entire educational experience im-
pacted by this law are ?nishing high 
school. Colleges must now handle 
students who have been taught that 
learning is synonymous with passing 
a multiple-choice exam.
The act, meant to close the 
achievement gap by rewarding good 
tests scores ?nancially, was estab-
lished with good intentions but was 
poorly executed. 
Recently retired high school 
teacher Kenneth Bernstein wrote an 
article in Academe, the journal of 
American Association of University 
Professors, highlighting the prob-
lems he saw in his students since 
the implementation of No Child Left 
Behind. He warns college professors 
not to blame high school teachers for 
the poor problem-solving skills they 
may see in students. Bernstein says 
student shortcomings stem from the 
act, not the teachers.
For potential college students, the 
fallout of this de?cit in critical think-
ing skills does not vanish once they 
graduate from high school. Teach-
ing to pass the test does not prepare 
students for higher education, and 
No Child Left Behind can have dire 
consequences for students once they 
graduate high school.
School districts across the nation 
have focused on teaching students 
how to pass the tests, rather than 
teaching them basic problem-solving 
skills, because a failure to meet Ad-
equate Yearly Progress (AYP) can re-
sult in the loss of federal funding. 
If a school district doesn’t meet 
its AYP mark for two consecutive 
years, students can transfer to nearby 
school districts. 
If schools don’t meet the mark for 
six years, they risk being shut down 
or turned into charter schools.
Flaws aside, the No Child Left 
Behind Act came from the desire to 
properly educate all students. The 
act would serve school districts bet-
ter if states did not threaten to shut a 
school down for failing to pass a cer-
tain percentage of students. 
Instead of requiring test score 
improvement, states could provide 
committees to evaluate AYP scores 
with a focus on improving the un-
derlying education plan. For school 
districts with lower AYP scores, the 
committees could help teachers de-
velop better curricula. Ideally, the 
committees would work with those 
school districts until their AYP scores 
re?ected the state average.
But as it stands, the No Child Left 
Behind Act forces schools to compete 
for funding. It’s time to reform this 
?awed act and teach for the sake of 
education.
Student government announced 
via survey that it would review pos-
sible expansions to the student Arts 
Pass program. The program cur-
rently gives students free access to 
museums and galleries in Pittsburgh, 
including the Carnegie Museum of 
Natural History, the Andy Warhol 
Museum, and the Mattress Factory. 
The program is being reviewed to 
see if free access to additional loca-
tions can be included. Extending the 
program may take a great effort, and 
student government should be com-
mended for its initiative.
It’s not uncommon to hear stu-
dents complain that Pittsburgh 
doesn’t have the appeal of a larger 
city. “There’s nothing to do” is a pop-
ular sentiment, especially among un-
derclassmen. However, the Arts Pass 
program is a gateway for Carnegie 
Mellon students to discover all that 
Pittsburgh has to offer. It entices stu-
dents to leave the comforts of cam-
pus and explore the museums and 
galleries in the region.
The program is vital to ensure 
that students have a realistic impres-
sion of a city that is their home for 
at least four years. Additionally, the 
program allows students to become 
aware of the region and develop a set 
of diverse interests through hands-
on learning experiences. Increasing 
student accessibility to Pittsburgh’s 
various attractions is a noble pursuit 
toward giving students a great col-
lege experience.
Any expansion of the program, 
however, must be done responsibly. 
Access to additional locations may 
increase the fee associated with the 
program — a possibility that all par-
ties should be wary of as discussions 
of the program move forward.
The Arts Pass program is a valu-
able perk that Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents have, and efforts to expand 
it are welcome. Ensuring the satis-
faction and well-being of students 
during their time on campus is one 
of the responsibilities of the student 
government, even if that satisfaction 
comes from attractions off campus. 
Evaluating and expanding the Arts 
Pass program effectively should help 
make Carnegie Mellon, and Pitts-
burgh as a whole, a better place for 
students to live and learn.
Arts Pass provides valuable perks to CMU students

A PERSON’S OPINION
February 25, 2013 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
Compiled by Kelsey Scott
The Tartan is feeling a little homesick this week. So we asked,
What is your favorite home-cooked meal?
KYLE HENSON
Since the days of Immanuel Kant, 
Jeremy Bentham, and John Stuart 
Mill, a continuing ethical debate has 
raged between consequentialist eth-
ics and nonconsequentialist ethics. 
Consequentialists believe that the 
morality of an action lies in its conse-
quences, while nonconsequentialists 
believe that ethics are mostly based 
on intentions.
This ethical difference is a large 
reason why liberals and conserva-
tives are in opposition when it comes 
to economic policy.
Utilitarianism is a form of conse-
quentialist ethics that states that the 
thing that results in the greatest good 
for the greatest number of people is 
the right thing to do. Liberals believe 
that taxing the rich more than oth-
ers is the right thing to do because 
the law of diminishing marginal 
returns states that as you get more 
of something, you enjoy it less. In 
other words, $1,000 would do more 
good in the hands of someone who 
has $10,000 than someone who has 
$100,000. Thus, redistribution is the 
right thing for the government to do.
Conservatives disagree on this 
point. Kantian ethics sets forth two 
rules: First, an action can only be 
right if you could wish to live in a 
world where everyone takes that ac-
tion. Secondly, actions are only right 
if they respect another person’s ratio-
nal ability to make decisions.
My counterargument calls for 
higher taxes on the rich is, “why is it 
that when you make $250,000, you 
suddenly deserve your money less?” 
This is a very nonconsequentialist ar-
gument. People’s rational minds are 
disrespected when the fruits of their 
labor are taken from them, regard-
less of how much they make. Coer-
cive government is wrong for just 
this reason. The more government 
actions that can be taken voluntarily, 
the better. The more privately owned 
toll roads we have, the better. People 
shouldn’t be forced to pay for things 
or take actions that they don’t want.
As an overarching example, all 
relationships between consenting 
adults should be legal and noncoer-
cive. This includes jobs that pay less 
than minimum wage, legalization 
of drugs, and gay marriage. These 
are voluntary relationships that are 
entered into because they bene?t all 
parties involved. When the govern-
ment interferes, this disrespects the 
rationality of the parties that engage 
in these relationships. This is wrong.
Yet there exists cognitive disso-
nance among those with any sort of 
political views. Liberals take a non-
consequentialist stance on social is-
sues such as civil rights. Any infringe-
ment on these rights is disrespecting 
someone’s rationality. Conservatives 
take on consequentialist points of 
view, yet somehow argue that gay 
marriage is bad for the community.
Cognitive dissonance exists in my 
own mind, too. Despite only wanting 
a voluntary government, I think pub-
lic schooling is the best thing ever. 
While I can justify forcing kids 
to attend public school until they’re 
18 because they’re not yet rational 
adults, getting money from the gov-
ernment to fund these schools is not 
something that I believe in. In this 
instance, I’m a pure consequentialist, 
even though I don’t believe that con-
sequentialism is right.
Many of the political differences 
that we see in the current spectrum 
of liberals and conservatives come 
from differences in prioritizing con-
sequentialism and nonconsequen-
tialism. Liberals and conservatives 
disagree about the arenas in which 
either view is more valid. These dis-
agreements are not just political dis-
agreements — they are ethical ones 
that philosophers have argued about 
for centuries.
Neither view is right or wrong, 
speci?cally because they’re argu-
ing about what, in fact, is right and 
wrong. 
Yet the basic questions that these 
disagreements come down to is: 
How appropriate is it for the govern-
ment to restrict people’s freedom in 
exchange for securing positive out-
comes for people, and how effective 
is the government at doing this?
My answer is “not very” to these 
questions, in most cases. The govern-
ment is inherently inef?cient. Any-
thing the government can do, the 
private sector can do better. Yet this 
doesn’t apply in all cases. We all have 
cognitive dissonance. Reconciling 
this is the pragmatic challenge that 
all who hold political opinions face.

Political decisions come down to the basic moral question
CHLOE THOMPSON
David Cameron, prime minister 
of the United Kingdom, expressed 
regret last Wednesday over the Jal-
lianwala Bagh massacre during a 
visit to the area to discuss trade 
agreements. The bloodbath took 
place in the Jallianwala Bagh public 
gardens in Amritsar, a city in north-
ern India. Fifty British soldiers ?red 
on a crowd of Indian protesters. Brit-
ish sources reported the death toll 
at 379, while the Indian National 
Congress estimated that the number 
was closer to 1,000.
The date of this tragedy? 1919.
Acknowledging the crimes that 
the British Empire committed in In-
dia is important, but there is a dif-
ference between “expressing regret” 
and actually acknowledging fault. 
Cameron didn’t even apologize ful-
ly. This declaration was also made 
during a trip to India to discuss 
trade agreements, which makes 
the sincerity of his statements even 
more questionable. Admitting that 
the massacre was a travesty paints 
both Cameron and the United King-
dom in a better light; though that 
bene?t was probably not Cameron’s 
only motive, this sudden revelation 
of national culpability is certainly 
convenient. 
Cameron is not the ?rst man in 
politics to dance around wrong-
doing. History has no shortage of 
“almost” apologies, even with the 
Jallianwala Bagh massacre itself. 
Cameron “offered his regrets,” just 
as Queen Elizabeth labeled it “a 
terrible tragedy” in 1997. In fact, in 
1920, Winston Churchill referred to 
the event as “monstrous.” He was 
not the prime minister at the time, 
and once he actually gained power, 
he was markedly less sympathetic to 
the Indian plight. 
Cameron did not apologize, be-
cause if he apologizes for Jallianwa-
la Bagh, what’s stopping him from 
apologizing for the Bengal famine of 
1943? Why not apologize for any of 
the other famines in India caused by 
British mismanagement and neglect 
— or for the con?icts and bouts of 
imperialism they visited upon other 
nations, such as Afghanistan? The 
list of peoples wronged throughout 
history is a long one. 
Apologies, once begun, are dif?-
cult to stop.
And even if Cameron had offered 
India a full and complete acknowl-
edgement of the evils of British colo-
nialism in the early 1900s, what true 
good would that have done?
There is no bravery in apologiz-
ing for something that you have no 
control over. Sometimes it is neces-
sary, but acknowledging the immo-
rality of the Jallianwala Bagh mas-
sacre does not cost Cameron much. 
The massacre happened about 100 
years ago. The current British gov-
ernment had no agency in the event.
Admitting that the legacies of 
colonialism still deeply impact the 
world today would be a braver act.
The massacre at Jallianwala Bagh 
is not still relevant today because 
1,000 people were killed by an im-
perial oppressor in 1919. Of course 
the victims of that day deserved to 
remembered and honored. But the 
massacre itself is still relevant be-
cause it was part of a greater narra-
tive of colonialism and oppression 
by imperial powers. Great Britain 
was one of those powers, but it was 
not the only one.
India, as a nation, still struggles 
with the after-effects of colonial-
ism. A Harvard University study by 
economist Lakshmi Iyer concluded 
that speci?c regions within India 
that were under direct British rule 
still have more dif?culties accessing 
schools and health centers, and that 
colonialism still impacts colonized 
nations greatly in the postcolonial 
period.
Cameron’s efforts would perhaps 
be better spent recognizing the lin-
gering impacts of colonialism itself 
instead of apologizing for a single 
tragedy in that narrative.

Time to wage war for minimum wage
MATT MASTRICOVA
In his State of the Union Address 
earlier this month, President Obama 
proposed raising the minimum wage 
from $7.25 to $9 by 2015 and then 
continually adjusting it to in?ation. 
Obama’s proposal is a breath of fresh 
air; the United States is long overdue 
for a raise in minimum wages.
As expected, the proposal re-
ceived sizable backlash, notably 
from Senator Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), 
who denounced the very concept of 
minimum wage laws, and Speaker of 
the House John Boehner (R-Ohio), 
who stated that raising the mini-
mum wage leads to greater unem-
ployment.
Both of these responses indicate a 
larger trend in political discourse — 
an over-reliance on suppositions, as 
well as an alarming disregard for in-
ductive reasoning. For example, both 
Boehner and Rubio’s reactions were 
based purely in theory and emotion, 
and simultaneously lacked support-
ing evidence. If the world worked ac-
cording to economic theory, as both 
Boehner and Rubio seem to believe, 
then their concerns should be taken 
quite seriously. The inverse relation-
ship between minimum wage and 
employment is a textbook example 
of theoretical economics.
However, this is not the case. 
Studies published by the University 
of California, Berkeley and the Cen-
ter for Economic Policy and Research 
have both shown that increases in 
the minimum wage have not result-
ed in any signi?cant increases in un-
employment. 
Vermont and Washington, both 
of which have state-mandated mini-
mum wages that are closer to the 
proposed $9 than the current fed-
eral standard, have unemployment 
rates that are no higher than the 
national mean — 5.1 percent and 
7.6 percent, respectively, versus 7.9 
percent in January 2013, according 
to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
San Francisco, which has the highest 
minimum wage at $10.55 according 
to the Labor Standards Enforcement 
agency of San Francisco, actually has 
a lower unemployment rate — ap-
proximately 6.7 percent — than the 
national average. 
In addition, the federally mandat-
ed minimum wage in 1978 — $2.65, 
according to the Department of La-
bor — is equivalent to $9.36 when 
adjusted for in?ation, according to 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics; work-
er productivity doubled during that 
time frame, according to the Federal 
Reserve Bank of St. Louis.
With this data, raising the mini-
mum wage is the obvious path to 
take. In addition to raising the living 
standard of millions of Americans, 
Obama’s proposed increase would 
result in an in?ux of $21 billion into 
the economy, according to Doug Hall 
of the Economic Policy Institute. 
Considering the current state of the 
economy, this is another no-brainer.
It is a shame that there are politi-
cians who insist on maintaining par-
ty ideologies instead of integrating 
data and research preformed by ex-
perts into their decision-making pro-
cesses. Politicians, especially those 
as prominent as Boehner and Rubio, 
should know better than to con?ate 
ideals with facts. This con?ation is 
essentially playing partisan politics 
with the livelihoods of millions of 
Americans, and it’s unacceptable. 
For the United States to remain a rel-
evant force in the global economy, it 
is essential to move towards political 
empiricism and abandon baseless 
appeals to pathos. If we continue 
to choose to base our opinions on 
theoretical ideals instead of practical 
results, then progress will become 
nothing more than a dream.

SPORTS COMMENTARYCoverage reveals gender gap 
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
After all of the hooplah 
of the Super Bowl nearly a 
month ago and the NBA All-
Star game last week, it has 
been a very slow week in 
sports. Because of the dearth 
of sports-related news, sports 
news outlets have been try-
ing to ?ll pages and air time. 
Since a viewer can only sit 
through so many terrible 
home videos of high school 
sporting events, the topic of 
choice for news agencies has 
been women in sports.
Now, this is not untimely 
given recent events. Profes-
sional NASCAR driver Danica 
Patrick, who is starting her 
?rst full season on NASCAR’s 
premier Sprint Cup Series, 
became the ?rst woman ever 
to earn pole, or ?rst, starting 
position. The fact that this 
race is the Daytona 500, the 
most prestigious race on the 
NASCAR schedule, has made 
the achievement all the more 
impressive.
Ronda Rousey, who won 
the bronze medal in judo in 
the 2008 Olympics in Bei-
jing, is headlining the Ulti-
mate Fighting Championship 
(UFC) 157 ?ght card, after 
UFC President Dana White 
said on tape that we would 
never see women ?ghting in 
the UFC.
This week also marked 
the announcement that, for 
the ?rst time, a female player 
will attend one of the NFL’s 
regional scouting combines. 
Kicker Lauren Silberman, a 
former club soccer player at  
University of Wisconsin-Mad-
ison and master’s student at 
the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology, is the ?rst wom-
an to try out for the NFL after 
the league changed its rules 
in 2012 to allow women to 
compete.
But each of these women 
has faced challenges and 
questions from both their 
competitors and the media 
that are holding them back.
Patrick has always had 
a large media following not 
because of her stature as a 
top female in a traditionally 
male-dominated sport (rac-
ing), but more because of her 
looks and personality. She 
has been featured in many of 
GoDaddy.com’s racy Super 
Bowl commercials and even 
participated in Sports Illus-
trated’s 2009 Swimsuit Issue.
As she enters this season, 
she has been plagued by ques-
tions about her relationship 
with fellow Sprint Cup Rookie 
Ricky Stenhouse Jr. After win-
ning the pole position, she 
was asked about whether or 
not she would accept the tra-
ditional kiss from the scant-
ily clad Sprint Cup Girl in the 
winner’s circle if she were to 
win. Who would she kiss and 
hug ?rst: her boyfriend, her 
boss and racing teammate 
Tony Stewart, or some new 
mysterious stranger?
Rousey is ?ipping the 
mixed martial arts (MMA)  
world on its head with her 
success. She has a 6–0 record 
with her last ?ve ?ghts end-
ing in the ?rst minute due to 
submissions. But she and her 
competitor Liz Carmouche, 
an ex-marine and recently-
out lesbian, have faced many 
challenges. Many UFC fans 
have been attacking com-
ments boards with discrimi-
natory posts, and have shown 
disgust at the mere thought 
that women or members of 
the LGBT community should 
be allowed to ?ght, much less 
headline a ?ght card. These 
comments have ranged from 
attacking her appearance, her 
skill level, and women in gen-
eral.
Now, to the UFC’s credit, 
it has used a much different 
marketing strategy when try-
ing to expand the female pres-
ence in the sport. 
Unlike basketball, which 
has separate leagues for its 
male and female players (the 
NBA and WNBA), the UFC is 
making mixed-gender ?ght 
cards a standard concept. 
With each card being bought 
as a pay-per-view unit for over 
$50 depending on the cable 
provider, fans are forced to 
pay for these bouts whether 
they watch them or not.
Silberman is suffering 
from lack of publicity. While 
female kickers have not been 
uncommon in high school and 
even college football for well 
over a decade, it took until 
last year for the NFL to ?nally 
change its rules to allow a fe-
male player into its boys club. 
They have been content in rid-
ing the publicity of 9-year-old 
Internet sensation Sam Gor-
don, who as a girl dominated 
her Utah pee-wee football 
league. 
NFL commissioner Roger 
Goodell even made her a 
guest of honor at the Super 
Bowl, but Silberman and 
many other outstanding fe-
male players at much higher 
levels of competition have 
been ignored by the league.
We like to think of ourselves 
as a progressive society with 
full gender and racial equal-
ity, but as these three women 
have shown, the media and 
the sports leagues themselves 
still treat them differently. 
Whether it is through me-
dia coverage, like Patrick; 
spectator hate and disap-
proval, like Rousey and Car-
mouche; or just ignorance 
and indifference, like Silber-
man; women still struggle to 
break down gender barriers. 
The media has a responsibil-
ity to cover women on a regu-
lar, consistent basis as they 
would any man who makes 
sports history — not as a nov-
elty on slow news weeks.
TRACK, from A10
Newby’s third-place ?nish 
in the mile run also helped 
the Tartans’ success. Newby 
ran the mile in 4:21.88, his 
career best.
The meet was highlight-
ed by several career bests, 
especially on the distance 
side. Sophomore George 
Degen’s time of 14:54.78 in 
the 5,000-meter run was his 
career best and a time that 
placed him second in the 
event. 
Distance runner Murphy 
competed in the 3,000-meter 
run and ran a personal record 
time of 8:39.89 to ?nish in 
third.
Sophomore Mike McDer-
mott earned All-UAA honors 
in not one, but three events, 
receiving second place in the 
long jump and third place in 
the high jump. 
McDermott had a career-
best event in the long jump, 
jumping a total of 6.44 
meters.
He also cleared an impres-
sive 1.89 meters in the high 
jump, earning All-UAA hon-
ors the second year in a row 
for this event. 
On Sunday’s event, the 
pole vault, he cleared 4.33 
meters and ?nished in third 
place as a result. 
Senior Noel Titus com-
peted well enough in the pre-
liminaries in order to compete 
in the 55-meter dash on Sun-
day. His preliminary time of 
6.53 seconds, his career-best 
time, allowed him to run in 
Sunday’s event and sprint to 
a time of 6.62 seconds, which 
earned him fourth place.
Finally, junior Mike 
Standish, O’Connell, Van-
denberg, and Titus won the 
4x400-meter relay with a 
blazing 3:23.68 time to give 
Carnegie Mellon its fourth 
UAA title of the day and ?nish 
off a successful meet.
Senior Ben Nealy said, “Ev-
eryone really peaked at the 
championships, and it was 
great to see everyone cheer-
ing for each other.”

Sports Co-Editor
First-year Abhishek Alla — 
known as “Shek” — although 
far from his home of Hyder-
abad, India, has served up 
a series of wins and greatly 
contributed to the undefeated 
Carnegie Mellon men’s tennis 
team.
Most recently, Alla was 
named the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Athlete of 
the Week for his performance 
the weekend of Feb. 16–17. 
Alla helped lead the Tartans 
to victory with his 2–0 dual-
match record against some of 
the team’s toughest competi-
tion to keep the team at an un-
beaten 6–0.
Alla posted a 2–0 mark in 
singles play. He started the 
weekend with a straight set 
victory at No. 3 singles, 6–1 
over Matt Romei of Haverford 
College, and then turned in 
another straight set victory 
with a 6–4 win at No. 2 singles 
against Matthew Heinrich of 
the Stevens Institute of Tech-
nology.
“I think that, in addition 
to my 4.0 for the last semes-
ter, the last two matches have 
been the highlights of my col-
lege career so far,” Alla said.
The Tartans recently de-
feated big rivals such as Am-
herst College, which Alla said 
has been “[the] greatest ac-
complishment thus far this 
season.”
Alla is certainly no stranger 
to the sport of tennis, having 
played for 12 years. He values 
the traveling involved with the 
sport and the opportunity to 
“meet new people.”
Put simply, tennis for Alla 
“just feels good.”
“Abhishek’s game style is 
very unique and he under-
stands tennis very well,” senior 
teammate Duke Miller said. 
“He is good at ?nding weak-
nesses in players and knowing 
how to use those weakness to 
win. Playing against Abhishek 
can be very confusing and 
frustrating for other tennis 
players.”
“Abhi has a very cool de-
meanor on the court. He 
doesn’t allow worries to get 
in the way of his abilities and 
naturally maintains a positive 
mindset, a trait that puts the 
whole team at ease,” sopho-
more teammate Bryce Beiss-
wanger said.
Besides tennis, Alla enjoys 
watching movies and partici-
pating in activities sponsored 
by the Mayur South Asian Stu-
dent Alliance, such as the re-
cent MayurSASA dance show.
Of course, his civil engi-
neering major keeps him busy 
with challenging coursework.
“Physics kicks my butt, and 
I plan to take Physics II at the 
[University of Pittsburgh] this 
summer,” he said. “Other than 
that, I can’t complain.”
Despite the adjustment to 
college life, Alla said that the 
“transition into college tennis 
has gone well.”
“The team has really been 
a big part of this adjustment. 
They’re just a funny group of 
characters,” he said.
His teammates feel the 
same way about Alla. “He is 
one of the most entertaining 
people on the team,” Miller 
said. “He is able to talk about 
school and tennis and doesn’t 
take anything too seriously. 
He always seems to be enjoy-
ing himself and having a good 
time as well, whether during 
matches, practice or work-
outs. He is good at speaking 
his mind and being very direct 
with people, which is often re-
ally funny.”
His antics are well known 
among the tennis team. “Ab-
hishek thought it would be 
funny to pack a bag within an-
other bag on our most recent 
trip to Philadelphia,” Miller 
said. “Everyone else was really 
confused, but he found it hys-
terical.”
“Shek always has a song in 
his head when he’s playing,” 
Beisswanger said. “Often a lot 
of players do the same but he 
surprised me in the fall when 
we played doubles together 
and following a missed shot 
he sounded of the chorus of 
‘Don’t You Worry Child.’ ”
Alla emphasized the close-
knit atmosphere of the tennis 
team, shown by their use of 
“meta-language.”
“I can’t even really de-
scribe the [meta-language],” 
Alla said. “It’s our own secret 
code.”
In addition to an enjoyable 
team atmosphere, Alla cites 
the proximity to family in the  
Pittsburgh area as a favorite 
part of Carnegie Mellon, as 
well as another factor in help-
ing him adjust to college life.
“It’s great to be able to get 
some delicious Indian food,” 
he said.
All settled in, Alla now sets 
his sights on his ambitions. “I 
want to be an All-American 
and compete at NCAAs.”
His teammates believe 
these goals are well within 
reach for Alla, whose ?erce 
playing style and sense of 
humor continually surprise 
them. “He has a really funny 
style of playing so it’s hilarious 
when he starts playing and ev-
eryone is shocked. Abhishek is 
simply incredible,” ?rst-year 
teammate Yuvraj Kumar said.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s track 
teams competed in the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA) championships in 
Cleveland last weekend at 
Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity. The men placed ?rst, 
winning the indoor UAA title 
for the ?rst time in school his-
tory, while the women had 
an impressive fourth-place 
?nish. “[We had] good per-
formances on both the men’s 
and women’s sides. Our re-
lays did really well, and we 
had some people on the po-
dium, which is always good,” 
senior Carissa Iannone said.
On the women’s side, ju-
nior Samantha Oleson led 
the Tartans in the throwing 
events with a second-place 
?nish and career-best toss of 
13.43 meters in the weight 
toss, earning All-UAA honors. 
In the same event, junior 
Jane Kim also had her best 
career toss, 12.53 meters; 
and this effort earned her 
third place along with All-
UAA distinction. The next 
day, Kim also recorded her 
career-best throw in the shot 
put, a distance of 10.44 me-
ters. This ?nish gave her ?fth 
place.
One Tartan, senior Emily 
Wobb, ran in the 5,000-me-
ter event. She sped along to 
a time of 17:36.23, the best 
time in her career. Wobb also 
ran in the 3,000-meter event, 
earning sixth place with a 
time of 10:30.92.
Sasha Spalding, a sopho-
more, made the ?nal round of 
the 200-meter race by beating 
her own school record with a 
new and improved time of 
26.74; this score was then 
bested by Spalding herself in 
the ?nal round. Her time of 
26.61 gave her a fourth-place 
?nish in the event.
On Saturday during the 
preliminary round of the 
55-meter hurdles, junior Jac-
queline Guevel sprinted to 
her season-best time, 8.44. In 
Sunday’s competition, Guev-
el had even more achieve-
ments: a second-place ?nish 
with a time of 8.47 and All-
UAA honors. Guevel’s suc-
cess also continued into the 
400-meter race where she 
raced to her career-best time 
of 1:00.17, which earned her 
?fth place.
Finally, four Tartans — 
?rst-year Alexandra Lewis, 
sophomore Erin Kiekhaefer, 
Spalding, and Guevel — rep-
resented Carnegie Mellon in 
the 1,600-meter relay team 
event, ?nishing third with 
a time of 4:05.25. All four 
women were awarded All-
UAA status.
On the men’s side, the 
team of juniors Kenneth 
Murphy and Josh Newby and 
sophomores Thomas Vanden-
berg and Douglas O’Connell 
collectively worked together 
to give Carnegie Mellon a 
UAA title with a season-best 
time of 10:16.08.  All four 
men were awarded All-UAA 
honors, as Newby and Van-
denberg are second-time 
honorees after leading their 
team to a third-place ?nish 
last year.
Sunday’s weight toss 
event had three Carnegie 
Mellon athletes ?nish in top 
positions. Junior Zachary 
Erra-Hernandez was a huge 
asset for Carnegie Mellon’s 
throwing team, winning the 
shot put with a total of 15.48 
meters. 
Junior Nathan Cheek and 
sophomore Gino Pilato also 
represented Carnegie Mel-
lon well in this event — both 
earned All-UAA honors — 
and Cheek had his best career 
toss of 14.73 meters. Cheek 
earned All-UAA honors after 
throwing his weight 16.38 
meters and earning second 
place in the event. 
Vandenberg earned yet 
another UAA title for the Tar-
tans with his performance 
in the 800-meter run with a 
time of 1:57.89. Teammate 
O’Connell ?nished right be-
hind him with a 1:59.10 time 
with UAA honors.

The CMU Marauders, 
Carnegie Mellon’s Quidditch 
club team, has expanded and 
improved in its second year 
of play. The team traveled to 
a tournament in Virginia, has 
held workouts outside of prac-
tices, and consistently worked 
hard all year.
The team is currently 1–4 
and plays the majority of its 
games at the Mid-Atlantic 
Regional Championships in 
Roanoke, Va. Season play also 
included a small tournament 
at Edinboro University.
The team’s ?rst and only 
win of the season was at the 
Mid-Atlantic Regional Cham-
pionships, in a game against 
the University of North Caro-
lina at Greensboro.
“It was a very important 
win; it was de?nitely hard 
fought and well matched,” 
team captain Don Hood said. 
The team ?nished 15th out 
of the 19 teams in Virginia,  
based on factors such as the 
amount of wins, number of 
losses, and point differentials.
The team plans on attend-
ing one or two more tourna-
ments this year, which will 
help it in its expansion and 
development.
First-year Arley Schenker 
said that the team “improved 
a lot through the fall semes-
ter,” mentioning that the sport 
is “physically demanding.” 
Team practices, which oc-
cur once a week in the cold 
months and twice a week in 
warmer weather, are com-
posed of drills and scrimmag-
es, and are supplemented by 
occasional optional workouts.
“The Harry Potter [aspect] 
isn’t that big of a part of the 
team,” Schenker added. “It’s 
[the] actual athleticism that 
comes with it.”
Still, teams at the tourna-
ment in Virginia were served 
(nonalcoholic) butterbeer, 
and “someone’s jersey num-
ber is always 9 3/4,” Schenker 
said.
The team helped host the 
Harry Potter Theme Night at 
the Schatz Dining Room with 
CulinArt, an event that served 
as part of a broader campaign 
to increase the team’s visibil-
ity on campus. 
“[We] are in the workings 
[with CulinArt] of making 
an even larger version some-
where in the fall semester 
[and we] hope to host a Quid-
ditch tournament in Pitts-
burgh,” Hood said.
Giving the team an on-
campus presence is a major 
goal that Hood has for the 
squad. 
Hood said that he particu-
larly wants to “increase the 
visibility of the team to the 
athletic demographics.... I 
want to get the word out that 
the team is a social group, but 
[it’s] also a sport.”
The team lost many veter-
ans this past year, but a strong 
in?ux of new players helped 
to balance the loss. As the 
team attends more tourna-
ments this year, and plans for 
increased visibility and fund-
raising, the sky is the limit for 
the Marauders.
Quidditch team ?ies to improvement
“Everyone really 
peaked at the 
championships, 
and it was great 
to see everyone 
cheering for each 
other.”

Four Saints in Three Acts
Unique, artistic production conveys American abstract
In an exciting display of artistic exploration, 
the Carnegie Mellon School of Drama presented 
Gertrude Stein’s renowned contemporary opera Four 
Saints in Three Acts, which will run through this 
week after opening last Wednesday in the Helen 
Wayne Rauh Studio Theatre in the Purnell Center for 
the Arts.
As part of the School of Drama’s Director Series, 
Four Saints was placed under the direction of 
Michelle Sutherland, who workshopped the 
production over the summer at the Florida State 
Performance Kitchen. Sutherland, a graduate of 
Stanford University, is currently a John Wells Fellow 
at Carnegie Mellon, where she is pursuing an 
MFA in stage direction. In a production such as 
Four Saints, direction is extremely important, and 
Sutherland did not disappoint.
The show is largely abstract, but is divided into 
various “acts” or sections. Throughout the show, the 
actors mention a variety of saints and communicate 
through short, repeated sung lines of text.
The set was a minimalistic white stage with a few 
triangular points rising from the ground to elicit 
what seemed to be staggered mountain tops. 
Costumes varied throughout the performance. Each 
of the actors began with the same look: barefoot 
with slacks and a blazer. At different points, some of 
the actors changed into bathrobes or speedos.
The lighting was also unique: They shifted in 
both color and intensity to represent the different 
emotional states of the characters, thus enhancing 
the set and the performances of the actors.
In order to fully appreciate the amount of detail in 
the School of Drama’s production, it is important 
to grasp the concept of this masterpiece. Written 
by Stein and composed by Virgil Thomson in 1927, 
Four Saints in Three Acts was meant to be a purely 
American work of art. Although it was certainly 
groundbreaking in terms of artistic exploration and 
performance, the premiere fell short of its goal to 
fully realize the American style of art —  probably 
due to Thomson’s employment of the European 
operatic style of singing. This shortcoming seemed 
to be the basis on which Carnegie Mellon decided to 
produce a purely American, stylized opera.
The entire work was a collage of American musical 
genres and dance styles. From an interdisciplinary 
perspective, Carnegie Mellon’s production thrived. 
Not only were the actors required to sing a cappella 
throughout the entire performance — they were also 
tasked with performing exciting dance routines, 
exhibiting various states of emotion, and creating 
percussion to complement the vocal lines.
Interestingly enough, Sutherland made the decision 
to leave the creative aspects of the performance 
up to the actors. For instance, according to 
the program, the actors created the music and 
choreography during the rehearsal process. This 
extraordinary accomplishment is a true testament to 
the talent of Carnegie Mellon drama students.
The production featured seven male actors, all 
of whom were extremely successful in setting 
Stein’s text to music. Standout performances by 
the cast included those of junior musical theatre 
majors Mitch Marois, who showed off his skills as 
dancer, and Daniel Bellomy, whose beautiful voice 
rang throughout the theater. Junior acting major 
Jordan Phillips gave a truly wonderful performance, 
demonstrating his impressive vocal range and his 
expressive talent as a dancer. Phillips commanded 
the stage with his marvelously high falsetto.
For the most part, each song was of a different 
American musical genre and featured a different 
actor as the soloist. Not only were the solo lines 
interesting, but the harmonies and percussion also 
seemed to fit perfectly. The musical aspects of the 
show were reminiscent of STOMP, with each actor 
creating complementary noises with either his 
voice, his hands, his feet, a prop, or a combination of 
these elements. In addition, the American styles of 
movement created an engaging scene to watch.
In all, Carnegie Mellon’s production of Four Saints 
in Three Acts was a grand success. Stein’s libretto 
is abstract and calls for a great deal of artistic 
exploration. Furthermore, Sutherland’s interpretation 
did not disappoint: The performance was a 
wonderful vehicle of artistic expression. Though 
intrinsically abstract, the production realized 
Stein’s intentions by creating a truly American 
performance.

Dear Patrick,
I’m tired of this whole

become a trophy wife 
already? I’m pretty burnt 
out, and I think I have 
what it takes. Help me 
make this work.

Dear WANNA-BE WIFE,
Not all of us are lucky 
enough to get by on our 
good looks (otherwise, I’d 
be out of a job). But maybe 
you’re one of the lucky 
few. Normally, I would say 
something about how you 
shouldn’t choose a lifestyle 
where you’re only judged 
based on your looks — but 
as a feminist, I will support 
you and tell you exactly how 
to go about it.
Your best bet is probably 
picking up tennis and 
hanging around a country 
club. Lots of trophy wives 
will already be there, and 
they can give you some 
tips for breaking into the 
business. Alternatively, you 
could head out to the yacht 
club if you’re the seafaring 
type. If you’re not into old 
men, you could try latching 
onto a CS major with a 
startup idea. He’ll be happy 
enough to have the attention 
that he won’t question your 
motives. Although an old 
man would probably be 
more tolerable.

Dear Patrick,
I’m graduating soon

There’s this one guy 
who’s actively gunning for 
the job, but he’s being a 
little creepy about it. He’s 
left notes saying stuff like 
“I will become you!” and I 
think he wants to eat my

do I know if he’s the right 
man for the job?
Thanks,

Dear REPLACED,
Choosing a replacement is 
a hard task. I would suggest 
your employers leave your 
position open in perpetuity. 
I mean, who could fill your 
shoes?
But if they don’t go for it, 
there’s only one solution: 
a series of challenges! 
Whoever completes them 
will prove himself worthy 
of being your replacement. 
He must be wise, resilient, 
soulful, and good with puns. 
The cinnamon challenge, to 
test his wisdom. The gallon 
challenge, his resilience. 
Watching The Iron Giant,

important of all, comes the 
Com-pun-tition. If he can 
pass these trials, then he 
may be worthy.
Or just give it to

Described as a “collaborative photography project” 
by the CMOA website, Oh Snap! is a re?ection of 
the museum’s efforts to increase public interest in 
photography by inspiring people to take pictures and 
share them.
As part of the exhibit, visitors are invited to submit 
photos that connect to one of the 13 pieces. Anyone who 
visited the exhibit the day after its opening would have 
seen the already-abundant response. Set in a large, open 
space just across from the entrance to the museum, the 
exhibit features several small “response” photographs 
arranged around the original inspiration photo. The 
space also leaves plenty of room on the walls for 
photographs to come; it will be interesting to see if the 
exhibit eventually receives enough photos to completely 
cover them.
Although there are plenty of photos lining the entrance, 
the piece that immediately captures one’s attention is 
a sequence of photographs titled “The Bogeyman” by 
Duane Michals. As one would expect from a sequence, 
each photo is a continuation of the previous one, visually 
telling the story of a little girl being carried away by a 
?gure, initially pictured as clothes hanging on a coat 
rack, that suddenly becomes animated despite keeping 
the same appearance.
The only sequence of photographs in the exhibit, “The 
Bogeyman” is unique; looking through this collection is 
somewhat like watching a movie. The advantage of a 
sequence of photographs is the opportunity to go back to 
the picture where the girl con?rms that there is nothing 
on the coat rack, and to then compare it to when the 
clothes materialize into a ?gure.
Michals’ collection of photos is surrounded by several 
other eerie black-and-white images submitted by 
visitors. The connection to the theme is certainly 
existent, even though each photograph has the ability to 
tell its own story.
“Space Ship” by Chris Shaw is another photograph that 
sparked a memorable collection of images. Interestingly, 
Shaw is best known for a set of photographs that were 
taken over his 10 years working the night shift at a hotel, 
which he suitably titled “Life as a Night Porter.” 
The image itself is just a revolving door, but like many 
others in this collection, at ?rst it does not appear to 
be what it actually is. As indicated by its name, the 
revolving door is pictured in such a way that it does 
look like a spaceship at ?rst glance. The majority of the 
images inspired by “Space Ship” consist of buildings 
and scenery photographed at unique angles or in 
distinct lighting that emphasize aspects one would 
normally overlook. An object as common as an escalator, 
for example, can appear strange and futuristic when 
pictured in black and white at an angle that makes it 
look endless, as seen in the response photographs to 
“Space Ship.”
“Space Ship” and “The Bogeyman” inspired only two 
of 13 collections featured in the Oh Snap! exhibit.  
While each collection is distinct, the entire exhibit is 
connected by the observation that all of the images 
taken are of daily life; they feature everyday objects and 
ideas to which visitors can relate. Many photographs 
feature people, including one collection that focuses 
on the effect that humans have on the landscape, 
a response to the inspirational piece “Rollerblades, 
Bonneville Salt Flats” by Richard Misrach. Another 
collection examines hair in response to the piece 
“Mkpuk Eba HD 694/74” by J. D. ‘Okhai Ojeikere.
The current themes of the collections may change as 
others submit more photos, making this ever-changing 
exhibit all the more interesting. Each photo represents 
a distinct background, a unique story, or a different 
lifestyle, making people and their everyday lives the 
central theme of the Oh Snap! exhibit.

First-person puzzle game challenges and thrills
Antichamber by Alexander Bruce is a de?ning step into new ?eld of gaming
Antichamber is weird. Most reviews use words such 
as “non-Euclidean” and “Escher-like” to describe it. 
Watching the trailer evokes memories of Portal, but 
with the brightness and contrast turned way up, and 
the portal gun replaced with a different, slightly more 
colorful sidearm.
After the nearly two-minute-long trailer, confusion sets 
in. Nothing seems to make sense. Floors disappear and 
reappear, walls appear where there were none, and 
staircases lead back to the entrance of the same room — 
all while you are running through stark-white corridors. 
It looks challenging, and not solely because the game 
appears to make no physical sense. It also challenges the 
player psychologically, urging them in ways one might 
normally expect and — more often than not — in ways 
many would never believe possible.
To quote Venture Beat, “Every aspect of Antichamber is 
made to get players out of their comfort zone.” Needless 
to say, I had to play it.
The beginning of Antichamber places you in a black, 
cubic room, with an explanation of controls on one 
wall, a picture of a fetus, a view of the exit (with an 
impassable wall between you and the door), and a wall 
with a single square that says, “Start here.” After some 
progression, you begin to question your understanding 
of the game. As you begin to understand the layout of 
the rooms, you realize, “Yeah, I get this, this is pretty 
straightforward, it’s just a little confusing sometimes.”
Then the game changes, and things previously 
understood must be completely restructured. Perhaps 
you stumbled upon a new room, or a new way to solve 
something you previously thought impossible — or you 
discovered a new mechanism you did not know existed. 
And this does not happen just once. It is clear that 
Alexander Bruce, the sole developer of Antichamber, 
knew what he was doing.
Antichamber never stops. In some games, when I 
get stuck on a puzzle, I’ll put down the controller, 
and come back to the game in a few days, a week — 
sometimes months. However, when you fail a puzzle in 
Antichamber, you don’t go back to the beginning of the 
challenge. Instead, you wind up somewhere completely 
unexpected, with an entirely different challenge ahead 
of you. Perhaps you can’t solve that puzzle. That’s okay; 
there’s another one waiting just beyond.
If for some reason the player gets completely stuck, 
Bruce discourages using a walkthrough. “You only get 
to experience the puzzles once,” he said in an interview 
with Ars Technica. “Take a break instead.” Combining 
that with the perfectly non-Euclidean world (where the 
laws of physics as we know them do not apply, and 
the expected should always be unexpected) and the 
wonderfully Escher-like corridors (where two lefts do not 
make a right, and three ups can make a down), you are 
treated to mind-melting, beautifully perplexing puzzles.
Bruce has made Antichamber as good as it can possibly 
be — and rightly so, since this project took almost four 
years to complete. It is simple, yet almost nauseatingly 
complex. It is an adventure, both through the impossible 
hallways of the game and through your own psyche. It is 
clever, intelligent, and unmistakably beautiful.
Bruce said he wanted to “create something that was 
out there, that people hadn’t seen before,” and he 
succeeded. This is a game that should help de?ne the 
upcoming genre of ?rst-person puzzle games, and it 
is certainly a benchmark. It may not be the ?rst, but it 
is certainly the most prominent and farthest-reaching 
game to expand on this genre. In Bruce’s words, “There 
is a joy in exploring [because the game is so different]. 
Like kids climbing a tree, just to see what’s up there.”
I hope to always be able to be that kid in the tree, 
and hopefully this level of quality and inventiveness 
continues to grow in the game-making community.

Spring Awakening details the sexual blossoming of 
young teenagers in a repressive German community in 
the late 1800s. The musical, written by Steven Sater with 
music from Duncan Sheik, was based on a German play 
of the same name. Frank Wedekind originally wrote the 
play in 1891 in protest of the rigid social standards of the 
day.
Melchior Gabor, played by junior musical theatre major 
Taylor Jack Helmboldt, is a misunderstood young 
radical who longs to break out of his repressive school 
and reform society as a whole. He’s smart, and he’s 
more knowledgeable about sex than any of the other 
teens are. On the other hand, Wendla Bergman (senior 
musical theatre major Emily Koch) is a naive adolescent 
frustrated by her lack of knowledge about the world. 
Other central characters include Moritz Stiefel (senior 
musical theatre major Trevor McQueen), Melchior’s 
lovably anxious best friend, and Ilse (senior musical 
theatre major Olivia Harris), the students’ bohemian 
former friend.
The sets in the show were beautifully designed: Both 
the moving riverbank and the lights that stretched down 
from the ceiling created an ethereal feel to the stage. 
However, one of the more confusing aspects of the 
show was tied to these beautiful sets: Moritz’s repeated 
interaction with them. None of the other characters 
acknowledged the movement of the brook or the lights 
that stretched down from the ceiling. But at one point, 
Moritz backed away rapidly from the brook as if he 
could see it as it moved toward him, and at another, he 
deliberately swung the hanging lights.
The costuming choices for the show were interesting 
but more effective in some scenes than in others. 
Dressing grown women in little-girl frocks for most 
of the play was an excellent way to demonstrate the 
dichotomy between who the girls were becoming 
physically and who their parents and teachers said they 
must be. However, keeping them in those same short 
frocks for “The Song of Purple Summer,” the ?nal song 
of the show, was confusing. Admittedly, the boys were 
running around in their underwear at that point, but the 
use of children’s dresses weakened the idea of growth 
in the ?nale. Were the girls still trapped in the infantile 
presentation that had governed their lives?
While on the subject of pants, having the bohemian 
runaway Ilse traipsing around the stage without them 
for most of the second act was a bit much. Her costume 
— thigh-high stockings, a man’s shirt, and a trailing 
scarf — was meant to convey her free-spiritedness to the 
audience, but it ended up being a little heavy-handed.
Like any play, this performance had its strengths and 
its weaknesses. This play was at its best when most of 
the cast was on stage. Individual performances could 
not match the frantic outpouring of energy displayed in 
“The Bitch of Living,” “My Junk,” and “Totally Fucked.” 
The voices of the cast blended well and created an 
absolutely phenomenal vitality on stage. While many 
of the individual vocalists were clearly talented, their 
voices sometimes failed to project over the instruments 
in the pit.
Despite this, many of the performers proved themselves 
excellent actors. The ?rst act was de?nitely the weaker 
of the two in terms of performance, but the actors gained 
con?dence in the second.
Both Koch and Helmboldt portrayed the dichotomy 
of children-turned-adults very well. This tension of 
confused adolescence is a major theme throughout 
the play, and the stars of the show communicated 
it admirably. They both demonstrated the growing 
sexual attraction between their characters well. Koch, 
in particular, succeeded in conveying both Wendla’s 
growing desires and her inability to understand them.
Two other talented cast members were senior acting 
major Katya Stepanov and senior acting and musical 
theatre double major Nick Rehberger. Together, they 
played all of the adults in the show. The adult characters 
in the show are written to appear as a uniform mass, 
but Stepanov and Rehberger managed to highlight 
the individual traits of each character. Stepanov’s 
contrasting portrayals of Wendla and Melchior’s mothers 
were both successful. Rehberger’s characters were more 
similar to each other — that’s just how the men are 
written in this show — but he infused each character 
with unique energy. His most frightening performance 
was that of the abusive father ?gure in “The Dark I Know 
Well.”
The show as a whole highlighted the idea of individual 
experience very well. Much of the choreography involved 
the actors running their hands over their own bodies, 
which emphasized both their feelings of isolation and 
their incredible yearning for touch from others.
Among the highlights of this show were the subtle 
directing choices that emphasized Spring Awakening’s 
central themes. One such choice appeared in the song 
“My Junk,” which describes the obsessive nature of 
teenage crushes. The cast clustered stage right, with 
all of the actors facing out into the audience. The girls 
giggled and waved as if looking directly at the boys, 
while the boys, positioned behind them, mugged and 
preened as if they were looking directly at the girls. This 
clever bit of directing highlighted the idea that teenage 
crushes are just as much about the admirer as they are 
about the object of admiration.
Overall, perhaps Spring Awakening was not the School 
of Drama’s best performance, but the actors were 
extremely talented and the presentation well thought-
out. It was de?nitely time well spent.

Sony Corporation held a press event in New York City 
last Thursday to introduce the PlayStation 4 — its entry 
into the eighth generation of video game consoles. The 
PlayStation 4 — the PS4, as most of Sony’s promotional 
material calls it — will be competing with Nintendo’s Wii 
U and Microsoft’s next-generation console, which is still 
under wraps.
Sony seems to have a short memory, since this 
conference was rather light on both surprises 
and substantial content. There were feelings of 
dissatisfaction after the initial announcement of the 
PlayStation 3, which had few titles and no killer app. It 
seems odd that Sony is not doing everything in its power 
to prevent a repeat of the days when the cry “the PS3 
has no games!” echoed far and wide across the Internet.
Even at this stage of the game, Sony hasn’t even 
revealed the physical model of the PS4. While the 
hardware exists and was used to demo technology and 
games, it remains unclear what the physical system will 
look like. Also, the ?nal system speci?cations, price, and 
release date are still up in the air.
What actually was on display was underwhelming, and 
most of the coolest features had caveats. It’s very neat 
to be able to use the PlayStation Vita — Sony’s already-
released handheld console — as a sort of bootleg Wii U 
GamePad for displaying games running on the home 
console and for acting as a touch-screen interface. But it 
also means you will need to buy a PS Vita.
Sony also promised a novel cloud-based solution to 
the issue of backward compatibility with games from 
previous PlayStation consoles. Gaikai, a service that 
Sony recently acquired that streams games like movies 
or music, will be putting the back catalog online for PS4 
users. However, this means that there will be no out-of-
the-box support for old games, and it remains unclear 
whether or not users will need to pay to access games 
they already own.
In addition, a new emphasis on integrating Facebook 
sharing into games and encouraging social play has 
resulted in many new features, including a button on 
the controller that allows you to share your gameplay 
on the ?y — assuming you make gaming a central part 
of your life. While no doubt a great asset for makers of 
machinima and players who like to spoil game endings, 
most people will need to develop new gaming and social 
media habits for this feature to be utilized well.
Speaking of social media: Bungie, Inc., which pioneered 
many aspects of social gaming (including on-the-
?y video capture), made one of the least climactic 
announcements of the event. Creators of the Halo 
franchise, Bungie let the world know that its hotly 
anticipated next game, Destiny, will be featured on the 
PS4. What Bungie didn’t communicate with its sparse 
footage of gameplay was that the game will also be 
released on the current generation of consoles — the PS3 
as well as the Xbox 360.
The way Sony represented it, the PS4 came across as a 
bundle of improvements instead of a game changer (pun 
intended). Inconsequential features — like being able to 
download a game’s update in the screen’s background 
during play — were touted at a presentation that did not 
promise much and delivered little. Hopefully for Sony 
and its fans, more developments will soon come to light.

This ?lm is easily the most fun Bond ?lm 
of the Connery catalog. The ?rst half is 
?at-out terri?c, with an iconic, indelible 
moment popping up roughly every 
?ve minutes. This ?lm features maybe 
the only attempt to kill Bond via some 
absurdly elaborate method that actually 
makes sense — at least in terms of 
how Bond survives. This ?lm contains 
arguably the best villain, arguably the 
best Bond Girl, arguably the best theme 
song, arguably the best henchman, and 
unquestionably the best car. In terms 
of Bond movies, this was as good as it 
got for a long time.

Skyfall

Aside from trying to be a Christopher 
Nolan ?lm, playing up a sappy 
backstory, and going full-out Freudian 
at the end, Skyfall is undeniably the best 
Bond picture we’ve had in at least two 
decades. The Shanghai set piece is one 
of the year’s best, thanks to the digital 
cinematography of Roger Deakins 
(best known for his work with the Coen 
brothers). Javier Bardem makes an 
amply cartoonish villain that, if mildly 
forgettable, is certainly performed with 
commitment. Daniel Craig is proving 
to be a spectacular Bond, providing a 
sneaky meta-commentary on the aging 
franchise.
The Spy Who Loved Me

This ?lm is often hailed as the peak 
of the Roger Moore years. For me, 
it would have been best to set the 
franchise on hiatus during that period. 
Nonetheless, it is the best entry in 
Roger Moore’s run. Jaws’ antics and 
Ken Adams’ unbelievable set pieces 
are somewhat inspiring, but otherwise, 
this is middle-of-the-road Bond. 
Admittedly, however, many see some 
excellence in it, and it certainly has 
one of the more appealing Bond Girls. 
Pitting the “forces” of Britain against the 
veritable war-machine of the USSR is 
unbelievable, but intriguing.

In terms of the video game, GoldenEye 
gets ?ve gold stars and a handshake. 
Each of our childhoods is probably 
populated by memories of that all-time 
great ?rst-person shooter. But does 
anyone actually remember the movie? 
It was Pierce Brosnan’s ?rst take on 
the role and his most admirable — but 
that’s not saying much, since he was 
a fairly dismal 007. Anyway, there are 
always free points for any ?lm involving 
Alan Cumming.

“I want it to smack you in the face,” said senior music 
composition major Adam Shield, speaking of his 
modernism-inspired music. “I want to force you to 
remember it.”
Shield was one of four student composers who saw 
their original works performed by the Carnegie Mellon 
Philharmonic on Friday night at Soldiers & Sailors 
Memorial Hall & Museum — and his piece, while smack-
worthy, was not the only memorable one on the program. 
All four composers presented remarkably complex and 
professional works, performed in all their discordant 
glory by the School of Music’s best musicians.
No amateur could have written these pieces. Far from 
the short, simple tunes you might have written in high 
school music theory classes, these works are full-?edged, 
passionate, and experimental. The compositions shared 
many of the same complex musical elements: dissonant 
chords, moving dynamics, intricate rhythms layered on 
top of each other. But beyond these similarities, each 
piece showed a deep understanding of the technical 
capacity and emotional power of music.
As the opening piece on the program, Shield’s 
“Catharsis” got the evening off to a dark and chaotic 
start with crashing cymbals, sinister strings, and blaring 
brass. Despite the ominous tone that carried throughout, 
the piece had some truly beautiful moments: Warm, 
haunting solo lines staggered throughout each section 
for a rich layering effect.
Following Shield’s piece, master’s student in 
composition Hanna Kim’s work was titled “The Passion 
and Resurrection of Jesus Christ.” But far from the “Ave 
Maria” you might expect, the piece opened with a 
cacophony of clashing, unnerving percussion — evoking 
Jesus Christ being nailed to the cross — and a ghostly 
sliding sound as the violinists ran their ?ngers up and 
down the ?ngerboard, barely scraping the strings.
These outlandish musical elements created an eerie, 
disturbing effect to portray Kim’s vision of the death 
and resurrection of Jesus Christ. Kim’s religious fervor 
was especially apparent at the end of the piece as the 
dynamics rose to a magni?cent fortissimo; it was one 
of the few majestic moments of the concert when the 
orchestra’s sound was able to ?ll the entirety of the 
immense hall.
With such technically and rhythmically dif?cult pieces 
on the program, the orchestra had quite a challenge. 
Although some moments in the performance were 
stronger than others, the orchestra met this challenge 
with grace and skill, showcasing the collective technical 
skill of its members.
Shield in particular was pleased with the orchestra’s 
performance, after working for only a week one-on-
one with the conductor in rehearsals. Inevitably, the 
orchestra experienced some bumps during rehearsals 
— but by Friday night’s performance, “90 percent of [the 
problems were ?xed.”
In terms of venue, Soldiers & Sailors surely held 
signi?cance for the student composers and the 
orchestra, but it seemed a poor acoustic choice. The 
space was so large and open that the high ceiling 
swallowed up much of the sound, especially in the string 
sections. Considering how sparse the audience was 
— there were only about 50 people in attendance — it 
seemed hard to justify using such a huge space.
At intermission, the program brie?y deviated from 
student composition to celebrate the 2012 Concerto 
Competition winners. Artist Diploma alumna Catherine 
Gregory on ?ute and alumni Erin Dowrey, Jamie 
Pham, Jack Rago, and master’s student Lei Lei Hoi on 
percussion presented a well-performed Suite en Concert 
pour ?ûte et percussion by André Jolivet.
When the audience members returned to the hall, they 
were in for a fascinating second half of the program: Both 
senior composition major Sean Burke’s “Noir” and Artist 
Diploma student Jakub Polaczyk’s “Squirrel Ball with 
Major F” were chock full of eclectic musical elements.
The opening of “Noir” is a push-and-pull between the 
rhythmic, lulling undertone and the heralding trumpet 
and snare drum that cut through the strings. Burke 
did an interesting job of blending incongruous musical 
elements: In the program, he describes the work as “an 
episodic dialogue between two main stylistic themes, 
neoclassical orchestration and jazz harmony and 
melodies.” Though the result was not seamless — the 
jazz elements were inevitably a bit jarring — Burke was 
able to merge the two themes in an interesting and 
experimental way.
Polaczyk’s “Squirrel ball with Major F” built further on 
this loud-soft dichotomy. This piece is characterized by 
several eccentric touches — a strange, deep, drilling 
noise issuing from the contrabassoon and a sequence of 
haphazard pizzicati in the strings. And as a playful and 
quirky conclusion to the piece, several members of the 
orchestra reached into their pockets and sent ping-pong 
balls quietly clattering across the stage — cued by the 
conductor playing a pair of ?nger cymbals.
The concert was a magni?cent display of the talent of 
student composers at Carnegie Mellon. With the level 
of complexity of each piece, it was hard to believe 
that students could approach their music with such 
ingenuity and skill.
According to Shield, he owes much of that skill to the 
Carnegie Mellon School of Music. After coming into the 
program with what he calls a “generic John Williams 
sound,” he quickly matured into a more complex and 
ambitious composer: “[The program] dramatically 
opened my eyes to what was possible.”
And speaking of possibilities, Shield has a wide range to 
choose from in his future ahead. In the immediate future, 
he plans to attend the Berklee School of Music’s master’s 
program in Valencia, Spain, which teaches scoring for 
?lm, television, and video games. Ultimately, Shield 
wants to write music for movies and video games.
For Shield, and surely for the other three composers 
as well, Friday night was “many years in the making.” 
Despite the modest attendance, the composers’ pride 
was visible and well deserved; the true pleasure of 
Friday’s performance lay in witnessing the fruits of their 
hard labor and sharing the concert space with such 
musical talent.

With the Carnegie Mellon Town Hall meeting on 
sexual assault earlier this month and the recent Senate 
approval of an extension of the Violence Against Women 
Act, gender politics are at the forefront of society’s 
collective thoughts at the moment. This is certainly 
true for Carnegie Mellon students and members of the 
Pittsburgh community, who participated in yesterday’s 
MOSAIC Gender Conference: The Naked Truth.
MOSAIC is an annual gender conference that offers 
“provocative sessions aimed at exploring gender 
construction in unconventional ways,” according to 
the event’s website. This year’s sessions were led 
by Carnegie Mellon faculty, staff, and students. They 
covered a range of topics — from looking at Roe v. Wade 
40 years later, to exploring the history of gay and lesbian 
social clubs in Pittsburgh in the 1960s, to analyzing the 
social construct of “man.”
The MOSAIC Gender Conference got off to an early start 
on Saturday evening with a performance of “A Memory, 
A Monologue, A Rant, and A Prayer: Writings to End 
Violence Against Women and Girls.” This collection of 
writings features monologues by well-known authors 
and playwrights and was edited by Eve Ensler (who 
also wrote the play The Vagina Monologues) and Mollie 
Doyle. On Saturday, ?ve students presented monologues 
to a small audience, allowing for an intimate and 
meaningful evening. The audience was encouraged to 
give donations that bene?tted the Women’s Center and 
Shelter of Greater Pittsburgh, a local shelter for victims of 
domestic violence.
Themes of domestic violence and assault continued 
throughout Sunday’s conference. The opening keynote 
speaker, documentary ?lmmaker and researcher Denice 
Evans, set the tone for the all-day conference with a 
talk titled “College Hook Up Culture: Understanding 
the Risks, Reasons, and Realities.” Evans’ keynote 
address included important and highly relevant topics 
for college students — alcohol abuse, legal consent for 
sex, and sexual assault — as well as video clips from her 
documentaries on college hookup culture.
Danielle Devine, a MOSAIC committee member and 
senior biology major, commented on the decision to 
bring Evans for this year’s keynote address: “We chose 
her because of the content, which I think was really 
good. It’s a college campus and we thought that would 
get a lot of people’s attention.”
Evans’ talk drew a fairly large crowd. Though it primarily 
dealt with male-female relationships and did not raise 
any issues that weren’t already prevalent on college 
campuses, it provided a pathway for open discussion 
on a campus where these topics are often overlooked. 
As Devine put it, “Even though the hookup culture isn’t 
super overwhelming at Carnegie Mellon, it’s still here.”
The breakout sessions throughout the day made up for 
the heteronormative focus of the keynote presentation, 
as they included topics like “From Daddy’s Debutante 
to Public Enemy Number One: What it Means to a be 
Black Transman” and “I’m (Not) Every Woman: Notes 
Toward a Queer, Feminist Critique of Drag.” The former 
talk was led by Michael David Battle, founder and 
director of Garden Peace Project and the director of 
prevention services at Pittsburgh AIDS Task Force. This 
discussion provided a look at Battle’s own transition 
from female to male and invited participants to explore 
their own privileges and biases. The latter presentation, 
led by local intermedia artist Dani Lamorte, presented a 
critique of femme drag and questioned prevailing ideas 
of drag as subversive.
Other sessions during the conference included “The 
House of Tilden: Gay and Lesbian Social Clubs of 
Pittsburgh (1960–1988),” a fascinating session led by 
Harrison Apple (a senior Bachelors of Humanities and 
Arts student in global studies and art) that provided an 
oral history of Lucky, a prominent ?gure in the emerging 
gay subculture of 1960s Pittsburgh. “The Social 
Construct of Man” session was led by Aaron George, 
Housefellow for the Intersection, and addressed issues 
of how men learn what is masculine and what happens 
when those ideals are questioned. Closing his session, 
George encouraged students to pay attention and be 
more aware of what is in?uencing them. As a way of 
overcoming social stereotypes, he told students to “call it 
out when you see it.”
MOSAIC concluded with a session led by Kate 
Hamilton and Kurt Sampsel, doctoral candidates in the 
English department, who discussed the importance 
of appearance and representation in gender relations, 
particularly in the media. Showing clips from Miss 
Representation and John Berger’s 1972 BBC series 
Ways of Seeing, the thought-provoking session allowed 
participants to engage contemporary media trends in an 
informed critique and was a ?tting way to end the day.
The conference as a whole included sessions for a range 
of knowledge levels, with some sessions drawing on 
well-known theorists and others dealing mostly with 
individual perception. With growing attendance and a 
strong, open community present, this year’s MOSAIC 
gender conference proved to be quite successful at 
engaging students in conversations about gender, sex, 
and sexuality that they otherwise might not have had.

After wading through heaps of red tape, piles 
of patents, and a collection of copyrights, what 
does it actually mean to own something that 
you’ve created? Is an idea, a song, or a work of art 
something that you can own and keep to yourself, 
allowing no one else to build on it?
The Phi Beta Kappa Visiting Scholar program 
sponsored a lecture last Monday by Lewis Hyde that 
examined these delicate questions. Hyde, who is 
the Richard L. Thomas Professor of Creative Writing 
at Kenyon College, has written several books on the 
subject, including his most recent, Common as Air: 
Revolution, Art, and Ownership.
Hyde’s lecture, entitled “The Cultural Commons 
and the Collective Being,” focused on collaboration 
and innovation. Though the lecture was somewhat 
scattered and felt thrown together, the message 
was still delivered clearly. The lecture was brief but 
inspiring, prompting the audience to pose a variety 
of questions on the common property debate.
Hyde’s argument centered on the idea of a common 
area for a community, which began in the Middle 
Ages in England. The commons was a large area 
in which everyone was permitted to graze their 
animals, plant crops, or help the community ?ourish 
in other ways.
In the midst of the differing opinions surrounding 
intellectual property, these ideals have been 
reinvented and reapplied to ?t a modern context. 
Hyde’s lecture drew strong parallels between the 
?elds of Medieval England and the vast ocean of 
culture in today’s world, speci?cally focusing on the 
controversy that surrounds collaboration, and on 
innovation that builds on art, music, or ideas that 
already exist.
The idea of a large pool of cultural material, be 
it art, music, ideas, or beliefs, that one can draw 
from in order to fashion something completely new 
and different is very alluring. In an age driven by 
innovation and the drive to get to the next big thing, 
it’s important to make all advancements publicly 
available, Hyde argued.
He went on to say that ever since the birth of our 
nation, the best and strongest ideas — such as 
the notions that drove the Constitution — have 
come from the spirit of collaboration. However, in 
more recent years, the battle for the right to own 
intellectual property has endangered these beliefs.
The lecture was relatively brief and very quirky, 
speci?cally the PowerPoint that accompanied it; 
the presentation featured relevant information 
juxtaposed with inexplicable pictures of Japanese 
trees. The overall message of the lecture was 
thought provoking and relevant, especially on our 
campus, which puts such a strong emphasis on 
creative collaboration and innovation. With more 
resources and ideas from which to draw, the realm of 
human creation positively explodes.
Imagine if red, blue, and yellow were all different 
ideas, created by three different people. Under 
the current copyright and patent laws — which, 
according to Hyde, discourage collaboration and the 
use of the ideas of others — we would never get to 
green, purple, orange, teal, magenta, or chartreuse. 
Think of all the colors that we have yet to discover.
Hyde believes that by changing not only the mindset 
of our culture — which puts so much emphasis on 
the ownership of ideas — but also the laws that 
restrict us as a creative community, we can expand 
upon our creative limits. All we need to do is add 
more paint samples to the mix and encourage 
painters to elaborate upon those that already exist.

In the rare event of cancelled classes, 
The Tartan asks students what they 
did on their unexpected day off. Most 
students spent the day alternating 
between sleeping, doing homework, 
and visiting with friends. Others, 
though, took full advantage of the 
freedom. One student said, “At about 4

and I don’t remember much.”
