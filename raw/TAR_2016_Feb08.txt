Lecture discusses methods to combat poverty facing Haiti
JAMES WHEATON
Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursday at 6 p.m., 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
in collaboration with Hôpi-
tal Albert Schweitzer (HAS), 
hosted a series of speakers to 
discuss Martin Luther King 
Jr.’s message about the im-
portance of receiving equal 
treatment despite one’s so-
cioeconomic status, and how 
this applies now to work that 
is being done in Haiti.
The ?rst two speakers 
were directly involved with 
Hôpital Albert Schweitzer 
(HAS), an organization dedi-
cated to serving the people of 
Haiti, a country with one of 
the worst poverty and infant 
mortality rates in the world.
HAS is set up in the Lower 
Artibonite Valley in central 
Haiti and is the only hospi-
tal responsible for provid-
ing full-time healthcare in 
an area of 610 square miles. 
They are responsible for the 
health needs of an estimated 
population of 350,000 peo-
ple. To put that into perspec-
tive, there are about 29 dif-
ferent hospitals in Pittsburgh, 
all of which, together, are re-
sponsible for serving under 
310,000 people. Founded 
in 1956, HAS has dedicated 
itself to providing vital re-
sources to those who would 
otherwise go without them 
for sixty years.
The ?rst speaker of the 
night was Loruchama Ostin. 
Ostin was born in Haiti and 
moved to America when she 
was 17 years old. Eventually 
becoming a nurse in Pitts-
burgh, she decided to volun-
teer at HAS for two weeks in 
order to learn a little bit more 
about her birth country and 
to help those in need using 
her particular skill set. At the 
hospital, Ostin and others 
work to cure diseases that are 
rarely seen in America, such 
as tuberculosis or cholera. In 
addition to this, many also 
work with a mobile clinic.
The mobile clinic is per-
haps the most vital part of 
the operation; because the 
area is so large, it is impos-
sible to get everyone to the 
main hospital unless they 
are in dire need. Thus, HAS 
set up a mobile clinic, which 
travels throughout the region 
dealing with inoculations, 
delivering much needed vi-
tamins, and teaching the Hai-
tians about how to recognize 
the signs of domestic abuse. 
Ostin ?nished her discourse 
by explaining the importance 
of HAS and the work being 
done by the health care pro-
fessionals who are quite liter-
ally saving lives.
The next speaker was Ian 
Rawson, the current Manag-
ing Director of HAS and the 
son of one of the co-found-
ers of the hospital. Rawson 
?rmly believes in the mes-
sage of the hospital. While 
addressing how the original 
founders decided on Haiti 
to be the location of HAS, 
Rawson simply stated “Haiti 
chose us.” While the Haitian 
population that they serve is 
by and large impoverished, 
Rawson stressed that they 
were never poor in “spiritual 
life, strength, or courage.”
Through the hard work of 
its staff and volunteers, HAS 
has undoubtedly seen results.

Andrew Carnegie Society Scholars give 
back to the Carnegie Mellon community 
VALENE MEZMIN

This year marks the 40th 
anniversary of the Andrew 
Carnegie Society (ACS) Schol-
ars Program. Since its incep-
tion in 1975, the program 
aims to recognize academic 
intelligence, excellence in 
leadership and volunteerism, 
and involvement in student 
organizations, athletics, or 
the arts in students from the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
Each year, the deans and de-
partment heads from each 
college at Carnegie Mellon 
choose a select group of stu-
dents that they believe em-
body the long-standing goals 
of the ACS Scholars program. 
To this date, approximately 
1,000 students have been 
recognized by this program, 
and this year a new group of 
41 students has the honor of 
joining the ranks of past and 
future ACS Scholars.
As ACS Scholars, this 
group of students not only 
has the privilege of being dis-
tinguished from the rest of 
their class, but they are also 
allotted $5,000 to give back 
to their community — in ad-
dition to an undisclosed mon-
etary award for themselves. 
“By empowering the Schol-
ars with an award to support 
their academic growth and 
with the opportunity to give 
back to the Carnegie Mel-
lon community as a group, 
the Andrew Carnegie Society 
continues to share the philan-
thropic spirit of its namesake 
with future generations,” said 
Allison Sokolowski, a Univer-
sity Advancement staff mem-
ber who works with the ACS 
scholars group.
While being entrusted with 
$5,000 provides a great op-
portunity for the Scholars to 
give back to their community, 
?guring out how to divide the 
money proved to be some-
what of a challenge for the 
students. On Jan. 23, this past 
Saturday, available scholars 
gathered in the boardroom of 
the Posner Center to engage 
in a discussion on how they 
wished to allocate the money 
to student organizations who 
applied for this funding op-
portunity. When asked about 
their motivation in selecting 
the few organizations they 
would be giving the money to, 
Christopher Herrera, a senior 
civil and environmental en-
gineering major, said “[The 
deans] all picked students 
that were willing to help, and 
we all wanted to make im-
pacts individually to people’s 
lives and the campus commu-
nity. We always went back to 
that whenever we had a dis-
cussion or an argument.”
After almost four hours of 
a very thorough, intense, and 
at times heated discussion, 
the Scholars were able to ar-
rive at a ?nal decision. They 
all gathered together in the 
Posner Center to present their 
decision to the deans, ACS 
board members, and Univer-
sity Advancement staff.

Pennsylvania Democratic candidates hold debate at CMU
DANA KIM
Junior Staffwriter
The Pennsylvania Demo-
cratic candidates for the U.S. 
Senate took part in a debate in 
Rangos Ballroom in the Cohen 
University Center on Sunday, 
Jan. 31. The event was hosted 
by Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s Heinz College in asso-
ciation with the 14th Ward In-
dependent Democratic Club. 
The chairman of the club, Sam 
Hens-Greco, kicked off the 
introductions for the debate, 
stating that, “The purpose of 
our forum is quite simple: we 
want to have a substantive, 
serious, and thought-provok-
ing space and time for you … 
and provide you with the op-
portunity to meet the candi-
dates, to talk with them, and 
to hear them, and we want the 
candidates to have the oppor-
tunity to talk to you and tell 
you why you should be voting 
for them to be the Democratic 
nominee.”The debate provided the 
audience with insight into 
the policy goals and political 
ideologies of each individual 
candidate. Through timed an-
swers to questions asked by 
the  two moderators of the de-
bate, Paul Klein and Krysia Ku-
biak, both Members-at-Large 
of the 14th Ward Independent 
Democratic Club, the candi-
dates tried to illustrate their 
quali?cations and convince 
members of the audience as to 
why he/she would be the op-
timal candidate to represent 
the Democratic Party in the 
Senate. The three candidates, 
John Fetterman, Katie Mc-
Ginty, and Admiral Joe Sestak, 
each attempted to show that 
they are more than just capa-
ble of representing Pennsylva-
nia in the U.S. Senate.
John Fetterman, distin-
guished from the other can-
didates by his scruffy goatee, 
shaved head, and tattoos 
— not to mention his large 
frame — held his ground and 
argued that he is prepared to 
implement change through 
politics at the national level. 
Fetterman is a Harvard Uni-
versity graduate with a Master 
of Public Policy degree and 
has been the mayor of Brad-
dock, P.A. for the past decade, 
but regardless, he may not 
have as much governmental 
experience as his two oppo-
nents.
Katie McGinty and Admi-
ral Joe Sestak, in their sharply 
dressed suits and proper pro-
fessional demeanor, seemed 
to be more comfortable on 
the stage and well trained for 
events such as this one. They 
both have an extensive back-
ground consisting of large-
scale political involvement. 
McGinty has served as the 
former chief of staff to Gov-
ernor Tom Wolf in addition to 
being the former secretary of 
the Pennsylvania Department 
of Environmental Protection. 
Admiral Sestak, on the other 
hand, was a three-star admiral 
in the U.S. Navy and formerly 
served as a congressman for 
Pennsylvania’s seventh con-
gressional district in the U.S. 
House of Representatives. Fet-
terman seemed to have the 
most support from the local 
population, which constituted 
for a majority of the audience 
in Rangos Ballroom.
The debate addressed a 
spectrum of countless rel-
evant topics through a myr-
iad of questions concerning 
important policy issues. 
Among the topics covered 
were environmental concerns, 
health care, gun control, and 
the refugee crisis, just to name 
a few. Fetterman answered the 
questions in a way that drew 
on his personal experiences 
and suggested that he has 
strong morals, stands by his 
ideological beliefs, and hopes 
for improved bipartisan coop-
eration in the Senate. McGinty 
argued that she is a diligent 
and determined candidate 
who has had considerable ex-
perience in higher-institution 
politics and empathizes with 
middle class families. Admiral 
Sestak emphasized his 
achievements on Capitol Hill, 
and used his experience in the 
Navy to exemplify his love and 
devotion to the country and 
the state and how these traits 
would affect the way he would 
handle varying situations as a 
senator.
When each of the candi-
dates were asked to speak to 
their respective electability 
and what distinguished them 
from the other two opponents, 
McGinty answered, “I have a 
track record of getting it done, 
and I have just a little bit of en-
ergy that I promise I will throw 
into the job.” Admiral Sestak 
spoke about his hopes to re-
store the American Dream and 
restrain military forces in is-
sues regarding foreign policy. 
Fetterman opened his answer 
with a comedic take on his ap-
pearance, stating, “Well I sus-
pect it’s probably harder for 
me to ?nd clothes to wear.” He 
continued, “The head of the 
Pennsylvania state party be-
lieves that I’d be the strongest 
candidate in the ?eld to go up 
against Pat Toomey, and I also 
believe that I’ve never shied 
away from a tough election.”
At the end of the debate, 
based on audience reactions 
and feedback, John Fetter-
man seemed to come out as 
the winner. This could per-
haps also be attributed to his 
position as the most relatable 
candidate and his popularity 
from being the mayor of a lo-
cal town. The 2016 U.S. Sen-
ate election in Pennsylvania 
will be held on Nov. 8.
The event was ?lmed and is 
available to view on YouTube.

Researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon have embarked on 
a ?ve-year, $12 million re-
search project to reverse-en-
gineer the brain in order to 
better understand neural cir-
cuitry and learning methods. 
They hope to eventually ap-
ply their ?ndings to the ?eld 
of arti?cial intelligence. The 
project is led by Tai Sing Lee, 
a professor in the computer 
science department at Carn-
egie Mellon and the Center 
for the Neural Basis of Cogni-
tion (CNBC), a joint program 
between Carnegie Mellon 
University and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
The project is funded by 
the Intelligence Advanced 
Research Projects Activity 
(IARPA) through its Machine 
Intelligence from Cortical 
Networks (MICrONS) re-
search program. MICrONS 
is part of President Barack 
Obama’s BRAIN Initiative 
which aims to revolutionize 
our understanding of the hu-
man brain.
“MICrONS is similar in 
design and scope to the Hu-
man Genome Project, which 
?rst sequenced and mapped 
all human genes,” Lee stat-
ed. “Its impact will likely 
be long-lasting and prom-
ises to be a game changer in 
neuroscience and arti?cial 
intelligence.”
In particular, researchers 
hope to discover the mecha-
nisms the brain’s visual sys-
tems use to process informa-
tion. This could potentially 
revolutionize machine learn-
ing algorithms and computer 
vision, while also improving 
the performance of neural 
networks, which are compu-
tational models for arti?cial 
intelligence inspired by the 
nervous systems in animals. 
Neural networks are used to-
day in cases where computers 
can learn to recognize faces, 
understand speech and hand-
writing, and make decisions 
for self-driving cars.
Researchers also plan to 
collaborate with MICrONS 
teams at other universities 
to evaluate computational 
and learning models of the 
brain, and hope to eventually 
build better computer algo-
rithms for learning and pat-
tern recognition. “The hope 
is that this knowledge will 
lead to the development of a 
new generation of machine 
learning algorithms that will 
allow AI machines to learn 
without supervision and 
from a few examples, which 
are hallmarks of human intel-
ligence,” Lee said.
CMU endeavors to reverse-engineer the brain for research on arti?cial intelligence
CMU seeks to understand why millions of Americans fail to claim their tax credit
Around seven million 
Americans every year, 25 
percent of those eligible, 
fail to claim the Earned In-
come Tax Credit (EITC), the 
primary channel of govern-
ment support for the work-
ing poor. These credits are 
worth, on average, a month 
of income. Saurabh Bharga-
va, an assistant professor of 
economics at Carnegie Mel-
lon, led a ?eld experiment 
with the Internal Revenue 
Service (IRS) in order to 
?nd out why so many people 
don’t sign up for valuable 
government bene?ts and 
to identify ways to improve 
participation.
The study suggested that 
the reasons why people 
don’t claim credit is not due 
to stigma or time required to 
apply, as predicted by tradi-
tional economic theory, but 
rather the result of “psycho-
logical frictions” like low 
awareness, confusion re-
garding eligibility, and inat-
tention to program informa-
tion.
The study estimated that 
a redesign and expansion of 
the way notices are distrib-
uted could increase the num-
ber of claimants by several 
hundred thousand. Since the 
study’s completion, the IRS 
has circulated redesigned 
noti?cation forms.
“This study demonstrates 
the value and need for rig-
orous evidence-based ap-
proaches to public policy. 
It also suggests that, in an 
increasingly complicated 
world, simplicity and a com-
monsense recognition of 
how individuals make deci-
sions can play a critical role 
in the ultimate success of 
policies like the EITC,” Bhar-
gava said.

Capital One event “People + Money” analyzes our relationship with money 
DEBORAH CHU
Assistant News Editor
Last Tuesday, Capital One 
hosted its “People + Money” 
event in the Connan Room 
of the Cohen University Cen-
ter. The event focused on 
“rethinking our relationship 
with money,” and featured 
three fast-paced talks by Cap-
ital One representatives, two 
of whom were Carnegie Mel-
lon alumni. The lively eve-
ning was emceed by Brandon 
Schauer, head of Adaptive 
Path, a San Francisco-based 
design ?rm acquired by Capi-
tal One, and featured music, 
free Jimmy John’s, and priz-
es, including a pair of Beats 
headphones.
The ?rst talk focused on 
credit, and was presented 
by Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Molly Johnson, who received 
her Master of Design, Inter-
action Design degree from 
Carnegie Mellon in 2014. 
Re?ecting on her ?rst day at 
Capital One approximately a 
year and a half ago, Johnson 
described her own confusion 
with understanding credit. In 
response to this, her team de-
cided to ?nd out why people 
fail with credit. Describing 
the people she came across in 
her research, Johnson stated, 
“Most of these people are 
extremely well-intentioned. 
They want to succeed, yet 
they still accumulate over-
whelming amounts of debt.”
Johnson’s team discovered 
that most of the reasons peo-
ple fail with credit deal with 
confusion about credit cards. 
She highlighted two speci?c 
aspects of credit cards that 
tend to confuse people: credit 
limits and minimum pay-
ments. Credit card spending 
limits for ?rst-time users are 
usually around between $750 
and $1,000, which is, most 
of the time, more than these 
people make in a month. 
“People rarely consider this limit in the context of what 
they can pay back,” Johnson 
said. “They think that their 
credit card company has giv-
en them permission to spend 
up to the limit.”Consequently, when the 
bill from the credit card com-
pany comes in the mail, it’s of-
ten more than they can afford 
to pay back in full. But the 
credit card company doesn’t 
ask for the full amount — 
they ask for only a minimum 
payment of $25. Johnson’s 
team noticed that “to a lot 
of our customers, paying the 
minimum … means paying 
exactly what we ask, meeting 
our expectations, and even 
being responsible.”
It’s not hard to imagine 
the disastrous consequences 
that can result from falling 
into this pattern after sev-
eral months. “Right now, our 
products are leading custom-
ers astray, yet we’re treating 
them as if it’s their fault,” 
Johnson said. “It’s time to 
reconsider our products, and 
start designing them in a way 
that helps people change their 
behavior and step back from 
that tipping point.” Her team 
has started to do this with 
Inform, an app that Capital 
One Labs designed to make 
statement balances (and the 
consequences of paying a 
minimum) more clear to the 
user. After a couple of months 
of testing, the design was met 
with “extremely positive” re-
sults, with the number of peo-
ple making only minimum 
payments reduced by half.
In the second talk, Jac-
quelyn Brioux, an experi-
ence designer at Capital One, 
spoke about what actually 
drives happiness and the idea 
that “money can’t buy hap-
piness.” Brioux spoke about 
hardworking parents who 
were so hardworking that 
they missed graduations and 
meeting grandkids, yet had 
no retirement savings and 
didn’t own a home. “They 
believed that having more 
money would be the solution 
to all of their problems,” Bri-
oux said. “But in reality, the 
relentless pursuit of money is 
causing them to miss out on 
life, theirs and ours.”
Brioux pointed out that 
“Money is emotional…. Our 
happiness and well-being is 
wrapped up in money…. we 
often forget it’s just a tool for 
trade.” After her own experi-
ences seeking happiness by 
pursuing and attaining ?nan-
cial stability, she found her-
self still searching for happi-
ness. “And I’m not alone,” she 
said. “Most of us aren’t happy. 
A nationally representative 
sample of U.S. adults found 
that 54 percent of us are men-
tally healthy, but our lives 
lack pleasure, engagement, 
and meaning.”
So what makes us happy? 
Citing a theory by psycholo-
gist Sonja Lyubomirsky, a 
professor at the University of 
California, Riverside, Brioux 
posited that 50 percent of our 
happiness is genetically de-
termined (?xed happiness), 
10 percent is determined by 
life circumstances (?eeting 
happiness), and the remain-
ing 40 percent is based on 
intentional activities that are 
done on a regular basis (last-
ing happiness). While most 
people focus on improving 
their circumstances, Brioux 
points out that the opportu-
nity to increase happiness 
lies in the 40 percent of last-
ing happiness. “40 percent is 
the portion of your happiness 
that is within your power to 
change simply by shifting 
how you think, and how you 
act,” Brioux said.
Brioux suggested six 
things to target that 40 per-
cent and be happy: be en-
gaged, create and sustain 
close personal relationships, 
laugh, think positively, ex-
ercise, and feel and express 
gratitude. “All of these can 
be considered intrinsicals, 
which relate to the soul…. 
they’re likely to meet innate 
psychological needs,” Brioux 
said. “Extrinsicals are the op-
posite. They relate to worldly 
goals, like money, status, and 
fame. Research has shown 
that people who realize their 
intrinsicals have higher levels 
of sustained happiness than 
those who realize their ex-
trinsicals.”
The third talk was titled 
“I just want to know if I’m 
okay,” and was presented 
by Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Sarah Calandro, who re-
ceived her Master of Design, 
Communication Planning 
and Information Design de-
gree from Carnegie Mellon 
in 2011. “I’m just going to go 
right ahead and say it…. the 
banking industry is the fourth 
most hated industry in Amer-
ica,” Calandro said. She and 
her team were tasked with de-
signing and building a Capital 
One 360 checking experience 
that people would love. “This 
was going to be a challenge,” 
Calandro admitted.
Her team decided they 
needed to understand what 
was working for people in 
terms of money, and what 
was not. After conducting an 
simple experiment in which 
they asked people to draw 
their money, Calandro’s team 
concluded that “people’s ?-
nances are made up of a pret-
ty complicated web of moving 
parts…. when people check 
into their money, they’re re-
ally just trying to ?nd out if 
they’re okay,” Calandro said. 
“Getting the answer to that 
question requires a painful 
amount of hunting, gather-
ing, and synthesizing, day in 
and day out.”
Calandro described her 
vision for what she hoped 
Capital One and other banks 
would do. Her ?rst point was 
for the bank to see its cus-
tomers as humans, through 
understanding and building 
tools to help them. Secondly, 
instead of striving for a pri-
mary relationship with cus-
tomers, the bank should strive 
for a strong relationship. 
And third, the bank should 
focus on holistically solving 
people’s ?nancial problems 
within Capital One, but also 
from bank to bank. “All this, 
with an end goal of being able 
to tell people… you are okay,” 
concluded Calandro.
with Danae E. Paparis, a se-
nior design major. Re?ecting 
on the goals of the group when 
deciding on the organizations 
they would give back to, as 
well as the amount of money 
they would allot to each or-
ganization, Paparis said “We 
were focused on outreach, 
high impact, and impacting 
the lives of the community in 
positive ways.” To do this, the 
scholars zoned in on organi-
zations that were not able to 
get the funding they needed, 
while also focusing on the size 
of each organization and their 
ability to reach the goals they 
were advocating.
While dividing the $5,000 
evenly would be welcomed by 
each organization and would 
provide them with the ad-
ditional funding needed to 
achieve their respective goals, 
Herrera felt it important to 
repeat the sentiment of this 
year’s Scholars by noting “we 
can’t save the world with 
$5,000.” He points out that 
instead of giving minor sup-
port to a large number of or-
ganizations, it was their mis-
sion to make a direct impact 
on a few organizations.
Herrera went on to list 
the seven organizations that 
the ACS Scholars decided 
upon. The ?rst organization, 
with the largest donation of 
$2,000, was Camp Kesem, an 
organization that focuses on 
supporting children whose 
parents are struggling with 
cancer. Camp Kesem helps 
to motivate these children 
through the struggles they are 
facing at home by providing 
them with an environment 
where they can cope with 
these issues. The money given 
by the ACS Scholars will help 
the organization continue 
their mission of providing 
these children with the posi-
tive environment they need.
The next organization was 
The Zahra Center. The ACS 
Scholars will be donating 
$575 towards the production 
of a play based on the novel 
Surviving Zahra. “This play 
is a product of attempting to 
meet needs across cultural 
communications, Muslim nar-
ratives, and the performing 
arts,” Herrera said. The Schol-
ars believe this production 
will allow Carnegie Mellon to 
get more involved with other 
cultures, adding to the diver-
sity of the arts being produced 
at the school.
Next was CMU in Haiti, 
which seeks to strengthen the 
ties between Carnegie Mel-
lon and Haiti via cultural ex-
change and provide education 
to people in Haiti. The Schol-
ars will be donating $500 to 
this organization to help pay 
for the expensive travel costs 
that allow members to travel 
to Haiti. Herrera repeated 
the sentiment that the mon-
ey they were allotted cannot 
save the world, but will rather 
allow ACS to have a positive, 
direct impact on these organi-
zations. In this instance, the 
money will provide a concrete 
bene?t by funding students 
traveling to Haiti.
Along with CMU in Haiti 
was Project Rwanda, which 
will be receiving $500 dollars 
from the Scholars directed to-
wards their Pen Pal Program. 
This money will help further 
connections between the 
Carnegie Mellon campus in 
Pittsburgh and the Carnegie 
Mellon campus in Rwanda.
The Carnegie Mellon As-
tronomy Club will be receiv-
ing $400 from the scholars 
to help fund their light pol-
lution outreach program in 
Pittsburgh. This program 
seeks to develop light shields 
for streetlights, among other 
things. “We felt like giving 
money to this organization 
would de?nitely help the 
Pittsburgh community as a 
whole,” Herrera said.
The Global Medical Bri-
gades will receive $375 from 
the scholars, which will be di-
rected mainly towards getting 
medication for their global 
health outreach program. Last 
but not least was Inter·punct, 
an architectural journal run 
by members of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s School of Architecture, 
which will be receiving $350 
directed towards aiding in the 
distribution of the journal to 
other college campuses. “This 
will make a direct impact and 
really help the Carnegie Mel-
lon Architecture community 
expand to colleges through-
out the nation,” Herrera said.
Apart from discussing how 
the money would be allocat-
ed, the students also re?ected 
on their experience as a part 
of this program where they 
got to meet new and different 
people from different back-
grounds and colleges. Re?ect-
ing on what she learned from 
this experience, Paparis spoke 
about being thorough when 
asking for money, the impor-
tance of being punctual when 
turning in a proposal, and in 
essence simply knowing “how 
to be an adult.”

majors of each of this year’s,

year’s, ACS Scholars can be

have been eradicated in the 
area. Pre and post-natal care 
rates have risen dramatically, 
with 100 percent of women 
having at least one meeting 
with a healthcare profession-
al before birth, and with 98 
percent of women receiving 
much needed iron supple-
ment pills post birth.
Perhaps the most impor-
tant factor that they deal 
with is malnutrition. Living 
in an extremely impover-
ished nation, Haitian people 
face a simple problem: they 
simply do not have the mon-
ey for food. Of the amount 
of people who go to HAS 
seeking medical care, half of 
those are children. Of those 
children, half of them are 
malnourished. It is easy to 
pretend that hunger isn’t a 
problem here in Pittsburgh, 
but for the children in Haiti, 
it undoubtedly is one of the 
biggest issues.
The ?nal speaker of the 
night was Michael West, a 
professor of French and fran-
cophone studies at Carnegie 
Mellon University. West ?rst 
took notice of Haiti from a 
linguistic perspective, ?nd-
ing the creole language spo-
ken there a fascinating deri-
vation of French. He and his 
students became interested 
in the Society of Providence 
United for the Economic De-
velopment of Petion-Ville 
(SOPUDEP), an organiza-
tion dedicated to helping 
the Haitian people through 
education. The students who 
traveled to Haiti in the spring 
of 2014 received no ?nancial 
aid from Carnegie Mellon for 
the trip and raised all of the 
expenses through various 
fundraisers.
Overall, the three speak-
ers sought to echo Martin 
Luther King Jr.’s message of 
economic justice. In the spirit 
of Martin Luther King Jr. day, 
they demonstrated the work 
that their two organizations 
have been doing in order to 
make his dream a reality for 
all people across the globe.

two organizations can be

On the issues: Student debt
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
With the presidential 
campaign raging on, most 
candidates have at least put 
some semblance of a platform 
regarding student debt into 
public view. We at the Tartan 
are here to wade through all 
the political rhetoric to give 
you the candidate’s positions 
as clearly as possible.
Former Florida Gov. Jeb 
Bush
Bush delayed on releas-
ing a student debt plan for 
months, but eventually de-
livered a highly speci?c pro-
posal. He wants to reform the 
incentives of college tuition. 
Instead of distributing large 
amounts of federal aid for tu-
ition, he would give a capped 
$50,000 line of credit in what 
he calls an Education Savings 
Account (ESAs). For each 
$10,000 spent from this ac-
count, the federal income tax 
of the student will increase 
by 1 percent of his/her in-
come. This add-on will hap-
pen for the ?rst 25 years after 
graduation. Need-based Pell 
Grants would also be distrib-
uted through these accounts. 
Students with existing debt 
would be able to make use of 
the ESAs as well.
Bush also wants to give 
universities an incentive to 
have students pay their loans 
by putting universities par-
tially on the hook for student 
loans after a default. This 
would, in theory, give univer-
sities an incentive to help stu-
dents either not to have debt 
to begin with, or to be able to 
pay off their loans easily.
It’s unclear what the 
mechanism is, but Bush also 
claims he will encourage in-
novation in education. He will 
also expand access to federal 
aid for students enrolled in 
vocational education and ap-
prenticeship models among 
other things. He also plans 
to expand access to informa-
tion about the outcomes of 
various forms of education to 
ensure there is a high return 
on investment for tuition.
Former Neurosurgeon 
Ben Carson
Carson wants to reign in 
interest rates by having stu-
dents only be responsible for 
the principle on tuition while 
having colleges pay interest. 
He also wants ?nancial in-
centives in place for colleges 
to maximize the effect of tu-
ition money, allowing costs to 
shrink for students.
New Jersey Gov. Chris 
Christie
Christie wants to make col-
lege affordable, but believes 
free college is not a good goal 
since there is an economic 
return. He believes colleges 
should publicly disclose ex-
penses to raise accountabil-
ity. He also believes Congress 
needs to put more effort into 
making sure need-based aid is 
actually distributed based on 
need. Christie has also men-
tioned the idea of tax credits 
for donors to increase the 
money universities already 
have and the possibility of a 
futures market for tuition.
Senator Ted Cruz (R–TX)
Cruz will occasionally 
mention his own student 
loans, but does not seem to 
have put forward a plan for 
student debt beyond saying 
he would prefer transferring 
loans to states. In 2014, he 
blocked a bill that would have 
allowed many students to re?-
nance their debt.
Former Hewlett Packard 
CEO Carly Fiorina
Fiorina believes the fed-
eral government national-
izing student loans has cre-
ated a monopoly that allowed 
thereby interest rates to 
skyrocket, expanding costs. 
She also believes accredita-
tions are too stringent. To ?x 
this, she would end national 
federal aid to create a free 
marketplace for tuition and 
roll back regulations on for-
pro?t universities and other 
education options that previ-
ously were barred from ac-
creditation.
Former Virginia Governor 
Jim Gilmore
Gilmore does not appear 
to have mentioned the issue 
of student debt.
Ohio Governor John 
Kasich
As governor, Kasich re-
cently signed into law a bill 
that froze tuition at public 
universities in Ohio and com-
missioned a nine-member 
panel that studied how to best 
manage money at universi-
ties. He also expanded access 
to AP classes and other forms 
of receiving college credit in 
high school such as summer 
school to bring down costs. 
Further, he set aside $120 
million as a debt relief fund. 
He has mentioned this on the 
campaign trail as well as shift-
ing tuition to being based on 
course completion and gradu-
ation rather than enrollment.
Senator Marco Rubio 
(R–FL)
Rubio would help expand 
information available to stu-
dents to help them decide on 
things like university, major, 
vocational education, and 
other choices based on out-
comes to make students more 
secure in their investments. 
He also wants to create a fu-
tures market for college tu-
ition where a student could 
have investors pay for their tu-
ition and pay back a percent-
age of their income as time 
goes on. Rubio also proposed 
creating one post-secondary 
education tax provision to 
simplify the deductions cur-
rently available.
Rubio also wants to reform 
accreditation, although it’s 
unclear how.

Raise a glass: Four hopefuls end failing white house runs

The ?rst state had its say in 
the 2016 primaries, and some 
candidates have ?nally begun 
to drop out of the race. One of 
the three Democrats and three 
of the twelve Republicans on 
the ballot in Iowa decided to 
suspend their campaigns, ?-
nally realizing that remaining 
in the race would be a waste 
of time and resources.
On Monday, former 
Maryland governor Martin 
O’Malley was the ?rst candi-
date to drop out, deciding to 
do so early on in the night. 
His decision was unsurpris-
ing, given how the Demo-
cratic race quickly became big 
enough only for former Secre-
tary of State Hillary Clinton 
and Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT). Though he had once 
been considered as the poten-
tial liberal challenger to Clin-
ton, Sanders’ emergence stole 
all the ?re from the former 
Maryland governor.
Former Arkansas governor 
Mike Huckabee also ended his 
presidential bid on Monday, 
making his decision around 
the time the media was able 
to con?rm the victory of Sena-
tor Ted Cruz (R–TX). Hucka-
bee won Iowa in the 2008 
presidential primary race, 
and he hoped for Iowa to once 
again come to his aid. The 
evangelical Christians who 
once lent him their strength 
largely gave it to Cruz this 
time around, and the former 
Arkansas governor ?nally de-
cided to leave the race.
On Wednesday morning, 
Senator Rand Paul (R–KY) de-
cided to drop out of the race. 
The Republican considered 
more libertarian than conser-
vative had once been poised 
as a wild card in the Repub-
lican race, boasting appeal 
among young voters looking 
for a different type of Repub-
lican. The re-emergence of 
terrorism as a critical issue 
due to the rise of ISIS, howev-
er, derailed Paul’s traditional 
supporters, who believed his 
dovish tones would be blind 
to the threat to American se-
curity. Lacking the fanatical 
support his father Ron Paul 
commanded in the 2012 pri-
mary race, Paul had little sup-
port to fall back on.
On Wednesday evening, 
Former Senator Rick San-
torum (R–PA) ended his 
quest for the presidency. Like 
Huckabee, Santorum was a 
previous Iowa caucus winner. 
In 2012, the former Pennsyl-
vania senator emerged as the 
single strongest challenger to 
eventual nominee Mitt Rom-
ney despite polling in the sin-
gle digits up until a few days 
before that year’s caucus. He 
was certainly hoping that he 
would somehow match his 
improbable last minute surge 
this election cycle, but he 
never gained any momentum 
as he was relegated to the bot-
tom tier of GOP contenders.
These dropouts are no 
surprise to anyone following 
politics. In fact, what may 
be interesting is how many 
people have decided to stay 
in the race. Retired pediatric 
neurosurgeon Ben Carson, 
who ?nished in fourth place 
with 9.31 percent of the vote, 
cried foul at the Cruz cam-
paign. A CNN post that said 
Carson was not going to go 
to New Hampshire and South 
Carolina prompted some Cruz 
supporters to say that Carson 
would be dropping out of 
the race, urging Iowa voters 
not to waste their votes. The 
Cruz campaign has denied 
any wrongdoing, though the 
senator himself gave an apol-
ogy for not verifying his intent 
regarding Carson’s future in 
the primaries. Carson still has 
some support among both 
evangelical Christians and 
voters looking for a complete 
political outsider a la former 
host of The Apprentice Don-
ald Trump. His extended stay 
in the race might continue to 
draw support away from both 
Cruz and Trump.
Many of the other candi-
dates in the race decided to 
focus on the New Hampshire 
primary rather than mean-
ingfully attempt to appeal 
to Iowans. Former Florida 
governor Jeb Bush, once the 
frontrunner for the nomina-
tion, currently ?nds himself 
with 9.7 percent support in 
the latest Real Clear Politics 
average. New Jersey Gover-
nor Chris Christie stands at 
5.1 percent. Former HP CEO 
Carly Fiorina believes she still 
has a chance at 4 percent. 
Former Ohio governor John 
Kasich, at 11.1 percent, is ac-
tually only 0.6 percentage 
points behind Cruz, and Ka-
sich has a better shot at ?nish-
ing ahead of Rubio than Bush, 
Christie, or Fiorina. It is likely 
that some of these candidates 
may decide to keep forging 
on ahead after New Hamp-
shire, a worrying prospect for 
moderate Republicans who 
may only have Rubio left as 
a viable choice. The Super 
PACs supporting Bush may 
keep him a?oat well into the 
primary season, and a strong 
showing for Kasich could 
keep him in the race.
Finally, there is one Re-
publican in the race who, de-
spite ?nishing behind “Other” 
in the Iowa caucus, still be-
lieves he will be president. 
Jim Gilmore, the former Vir-
ginia governor, said that he 
was pleased with his 12 vote 
showing in Iowa. Though he 
doesn’t register at all in any 
Real Clear Politics average, 
Gilmore believes that some-
how he will be the Republi-
can nominee. If he gets one 
delegate, it is possible that 
he might make some magic 
happen should none of the 
candidates obtain a majority 
of delegates at the end of all 
50 primaries. He’ll need more 
than 12 votes to get that one 
delegate, though.

This past Monday, Feb. 1, 
the premier electoral event 
of the United States Presi-
dent nominating process oc-
curred in Iowa. The Hawkeye 
State’s 99 counties and 1,681 
precincts voted on both the 
Republican and Democratic 
Party candidates. The famous 
Iowa Caucus is recognized 
for a 50 percent accuracy rate 
in determining each party’s 
presidential nominee. While 
the GOP winner is determined 
through popular vote, the 
Democratic process is a little 
more complex.
 In order to win the cau-
cus for the Democratic Party, 
the candidate must have the 
largest number of delegates. 
Each of the 99 Iowan pre-
cincts divides its delegate 
seats among the participants. 
The caucus-goers stand in 
designated areas of the voting 
site to demonstrate support 
for a particular candidate, 
and each participant spends 
roughly 30 minutes trying to 
convince friends and neigh-
bors to join. Democrats who 
remain undecided on any can-
didate stand in a designated 
undecided area.
About half an hour into 
electioneering, the caucus of-
?cials then determine which 
candidates are viable.
In order to be a contestable 
contender, the candidate must 
have the support of at least 
15 percent of attendees. This 
week, former Maryland gov-
ernor Martin O’Malley often 
failed to meet that mark and 
received less than 1 percent 
of the total vote along with no 
delegates.
The Iowa Caucus often pre-
dicts each party’s presidential 
nomination. Those who per-
form well in the polls still 
have a shot at their campaign, 
while those who do not realize 
it is wiser to drop out. Though 
O’Malley has suspended his 
campaign, the Democratic 
Party is not happy with the 
neck-and-neck tie between 
former Secretary of State Hill-
ary Clinton and former Sena-
tor Bernie Sanders.
Both candidates failed 
to establish themselves as 
the clear frontrunner of the 
Democratic Party. This is es-
pecially a blow to Clinton who 
was believed to have been the 
favorite at the Iowa Caucus. 
Yet, as the results show, Clin-
ton received 23 delegates and 
49.9 percent support, while 
Sanders received 21 delegates 
and 49.6 percent of the Iowan 
vote. While Clinton did indeed 
win the caucus, she did so by a 
very lucky, razor-thin margin.
Allegedly, Clinton won the 
caucus by a ?ip of a coin in 
as many as six separate vot-
ing sites. The odds of that oc-
curring are not only 1 in 64 
and the claim is also simply 
dishonest. Even if Clinton won 
the “Miracle Six,” it barely 
gave her a leg up over her 
competitor Sanders. In fact, 
the tie was so close that many 
Iowans reported a number of 
tiebreakers at numerous vot-
ing sites, some of which Sand-
ers did win. The Iowa Caucus 
saw the largest number of 
Democratic caucus-goers in 
caucus history, with 171,508 
residents preferring either 
Clinton or Sanders. Though 
Hillary Clinton came in the 
lead with barely a 0.3 percent 
margin, it was the closest in 
40 years at the Iowa Demo-
cratic Caucus.
This close race leaves a lot 
to be determined in the up-
coming months.
New Hampshire promises 
even more confusion for both 
parties. Moreover, the con-
gressional and state conven-
tions in April and June will be 
the true determinants of the 
Democratic party’s nominee.

Cruz pulls of shocking win, Rubio overperforms in Iowa
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Contributing Editor
Last Monday, the Iowa 
Caucuses of?cially kicked off 
the 2016 presidential race. 
Candidates from the Repub-
lican and Democratic parties 
faced their ?rst real tests of 
public opinion. For the Re-
publicans, the night was a 
?ght between the establish-
ment and outsiders as well as 
a way to narrow the ?eld.
Going into the caucus, 
polls had shown real estate 
developer Donald Trump 
leading the pack, as he had 
been for several months be-
forehand. At the end of the 
night, however, Senator Ted 
Cruz (R–TX) took ?rst place, 
followed by Trump, Senator 
Marco Rubio (R–FL), retired 
pediatric neurosurgeon Ben 
Carson, Senator Rand Paul 
(R–KY), former Florida gov-
ernor Jeb Bush, and six other 
candidates.
Trump, Cruz, and Car-
son all present themselves as 
outsiders, people who aren’t 
entangled in the mess of 
Washington, D.C.. Trump and 
Carson worked in the private 
sector, having never held pub-
lic of?ce before, while Cruz is 
a senator — he was elected 
in the 2012 election with a 
grassroots campaign focused 
on conservative social issues.
Rubio, on the other hand, 
has been in politics since 
1998, most recently as a sena-
tor. Along with Jeb Bush — 
who comes from a family that 
includes two past presidents 
— and a handful of others, 
Rubio is one of the establish-
ment’s greatest hopes to keep 
control of its party.
Since Senator John Mc-
Cain’s (R–AZ) loss in 2008, 
the Republican party has been 
split between the somewhat 
moderate establishment and 
the ultra-conservatives, many 
of whom align with the Tea 
Party movement.
In 2012, after former Mas-
sachusetts governor Mitt 
Romney’s loss, the Republi-
can Party ran a so-called “au-
topsy,” and found that they 
weren’t appealing to minori-
ties and women, that their 
stances on social issues like 
marriage equality and immi-
gration were off-putting, and 
that their more mainstream 
politicians, namely gover-
nors, were doing well.
The moderates in the Re-
publican race have a chance 
to address the issues from the 
autopsy — including some of 
the governors named in the 
report, like New Jersey’s Chris 
Christie and Ohio’s John Ka-
sich — but the conservative 
wing that broke away after 
Obama’s election is threaten-
ing to continue moving the 
Republican Party to the right.
The Iowa Caucus was 
America’s ?rst look at vot-
ing patterns, and to have a 
look at where the Republican 
Party might be headed next. 
Cruz took ?rst place with 27.6 
percent of the vote, slowing 
down the Trump train that 
had seemed unstoppable.
Despite placing second in a 
?eld of 12, Trump lost a lot of 
momentum. He was decisive-
ly behind Cruz, taking 24.3 
percent of the vote (45,427 
compared to Cruz’s 51,666). 
His campaign is based al-
most entirely on his ?amboy-
ant attitude and supersized 
proposals. When his promises 
of being a winner didn’t work 
out, it made it harder to see 
his ideas as realistic.
In third place was Marco 
Rubio, with 23.1 percent of 
the vote. With his clear posi-
tion in the top pack of the race, 
Rubio is now the hope of the 
Republican establishment. As 
other candidates drop out of 
the race, he’s likely to see an 
upswell of support, as he pres-
ents a more familiar face and 
greater experience in politics.
Of the three leaders, the 
entrance polls show some in-
teresting information. Rubio, 
a more traditional candidate, 
has the support of voters who 
care most about who can win 
in a general election. Cruz 
has the support of people 
who care about sharing val-
ues with candidates, while 
Trump wins over the constitu-
ents who care about bringing 
about change and “telling it 
like it is.”
Additionally, Cruz had the 
most of the very conservative 
voters, Rubio won the some-
what conservative voters, 
and most of the independent 
or liberal voters supported 
Trump. People who believed 
the next president should be 
experienced in politics voted 
for Rubio, whereas people 
who wanted an outsider 
mostly voted for Trump. Cruz 
won mediocre support from 
both groups, likely because 
he’s not a complete outsider, 
but still doesn’t have much 
experience.
These groupings demon-
strate the split between the 
establishment and the ultra-
conservatives fairly well. It’s 
still early in the nomination 
process, but it looks as though 
Cruz and Trump will be ?ght-
ing for the outsider label 
(with Carson barely hanging 
in there as well, earning 9.3 
percent of Iowa’s votes), and 
Rubio handily leading the 
mainstream Republicans, at 
least for now.
Bush will be looking to 
challenge Rubio’s hold in the 
later primaries, but despite 
having high name recogni-
tion, his family’s history may 
be more hindrance than help.
As for the other six candi-
dates in Iowa, they have little 
to no chance to the nomina-
tion. Paul, despite winning 
4.5 percent of the vote — 
ahead of Bush’s 2.8 percent 
— dropped out after the Iowa 
caucuses, vowing to continue 
the ?ght for liberty. Rick San-
torum and Mike Huckabee 
also dropped out after receiv-
ing dismal showings.
Former HP CEO Carly 
Fiorina and Kasich remain in 
the race, having earned one 
delegate each from the Iowa 
Caucus; Christie and former 
Virginia governor Jim Gilm-
ore are also hoping to do bet-
ter in future contests, having 
received no delegates in Iowa. 
Gilmore received a total of 12 
votes, but that isn’t stopping 
his doomed charge toward 
the presidency.
As the election season 
moves forward, more candi-
dates will drop out and sup-
port will begin to coalesce 
around the remaining few. 
Will the far right take over the 
Republican Party, nominating 
someone like Cruz or Trump? 
Or will Rubio — or Bush, 
possibly — take back control 
from the outsider faction?
After a few more prima-
ries, including 12 states on 
March 1 (“Super Tuesday”), 
there will be more of an idea 
which way the party is going 
to swing.

Clinton, Sanders exchange shots in heated ?fth debate
BARBARA SAMANIEGO
Staffwriter
Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton and Senator Bernie 
Sanders (I–VT) faced off in 
New Hampshire this Thurs-
day during MSNBC’s ?fth 
presidential debate. Accord-
ing to CNN, Thursday’s debate 
was highly praised by political 
observers, but poorly received 
by its 4.5 million ordinary 
viewers, earning by far the 
lowest ratings of the debates 
in the 2016 election cycle.
Thursday’s debate exhib-
ited the key differences be-
tween the two Democratic 
candidates. Although both 
showed their weaknesses, 
they presented convincing ar-
guments that were met with 
applause from the audience.
Sanders clearly placed 
economic reform at the top 
of his priorities as the demo-
cratic nominee, whereas Clin-
ton stated that she wanted 
to build on the progress the 
United States has made under 
Obama’s presidency and con-
tinue reforming healthcare, 
immigration policy, climate 
regulations, and gun laws 
with equal priority.
Sanders emphasized that 
the United States’ current eco-
nomic structure is the great-
est weapon working against 
democracy, speaking to the 
national concern about the 
political system’s representa-
tion of wealthy individuals 
and large corporations in-
stead of the American people.
“There is a reason why 
these people are putting huge 
amounts of money into our 
political system. It is under-
mining American democracy 
and it is allowing Congress to 
represent wealthy campaign 
contributors and not the 
working families of this coun-
try,” Sanders said.
Clinton, who has received 
millions of dollars in speak-
ing fees and donations from 
Wall Street, addressed Sand-
ers’ implication of her own 
corruption. She noted that 
Obama had also received do-
nations from Wall Street dur-
ing his campaign, and asked 
that Sanders directly speak to 
the issue of her donations.
“The root of that word, 
progressive, is progress, but 
I’ve heard Senator Sand-
ers’ comments and it’s really 
caused me to wonder who’s 
left in the progressive wing of 
the Democratic party,” Clin-
ton said.
Clinton previously re-
ceived $675,000 in speaking 
fees from Goldman Sachs, 
but hedged away when asked 
if she would release the tran-
scripts of her speeches.
Clinton maintained that, 
as a progressive herself, she 
wants to build on the educa-
tion and healthcare reforms 
that have already been initiat-
ed in the country. In previous 
years, Clinton herself pushed 
for these reforms and prom-
ised that she would continue 
?ghting to improve them. She 
argued that Sanders’ plans for 
free higher public education 
and free universal healthcare 
would dismantle the progress 
that has already been made 
and force the country to start 
the ?ght over.
Sanders, however, pro-
posed a plan for providing 
American people with the 
right for free healthcare and 
higher education. He noted  
the nations large income gap 
and how little large corpora-
tions are currently taxed, and 
implied that the money that 
would come from taxing these 
corporations would be able to 
pay for both healthcare and 
higher education.
Sanders also stated that 
free, public, secondary school 
education was no longer 
enough for Americans. He de-
nied that his plan to provide 
working class Americans with 
affordable healthcare and ed-
ucation would dismantle any 
sort of previous progress.
Clinton stood out in her 
foreign policy arguments. She 
highlighted her experience as 
secretary of state and demon-
strated a stronger knowledge 
of the subject than Sanders. 
Sanders himself stated that 
Clinton was the best quali-
?ed candidate of the two to 
handle foreign affairs.
Clinton listed her quali?-
cations for addressing foreign 
affairs as president, empha-
sizing the importance of  for-
eign policy during a time of 
international crisis.
Both candidates expressed 
a desire to withdraw Ameri-
can troops from the Middle 
East but their opinions on 
the greatest potential mili-
tary threats differed. Clinton 
explained her concern about 
increased tensions with Rus-
sia, while Sanders expressed 
a great deal of unease about 
North Korea.
Another notable difference 
between the two candidates is 
their opinion on capital pun-
ishment. Clinton contended 
that the death penalty should 
be permissible under extreme 
circumstances, but Sand-
ers argued that the penalty 
should never be used due to 
issues of racial injustices and 
discrepancies between states.
“In a world of so much vio-
lence and killing, I just don’t 
believe that government itself 
should be part of the killing,” 
Sanders said.
Clinton and Sanders are 
scheduled to debate again 
next Thursday in Wisconsin. 
The debate will be the sixth of 
the current primary season.
Candidates plan to address student debt as president
DEBT, from A4
Trump Entertainment 
Resorts Owner Donald 
Trump
Trump has harshly criti-
cized the federal aid program 
saying it is “…not fair. It is one 
of the only places, frankly, 
where our country actually 
makes money.” He has not put 
forward his own plan.
Former Secretary of 
State Hillary Clinton
Secretary Clinton wants 
to expand aid to states and 
possibly condition some of it 
on cutting costs to help bring 
down tuition. She wants stu-
dents to attend college debt-
free, including having stu-
dents work a minimum of ten 
hours per week. She would 
make community college tu-
ition free and would allow 
college graduates to re?nance 
their debt and lower their in-
terest rates.
Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I–VT)
Sanders wants to make 
public tuition free and wants 
to prevent the government 
from pro?ting on student 
loans. He also wants to cut 
down interest rates and make 
it possible for students to 
re?nance their debts at in-
terest rates similar to other 
industries’ current low rates. 
His most common example is 
the automobile industry. He 
claims that a citizen can get a 
loan on a car for 1–2 percent 
interest whereas a student 
will be forced to pay 5–7 per-
cent interest on a federal loan. 
He wants to allow students to 
use need-based ?nancial aid 
and work study to shrink debt 
at private universities in or-
der to prevent in?ating costs 
from making college inac-
cessible. He plans to pay this 
via a ?nancial transaction tax 
on Wall Street speculation in 
order to slow high-frequency 
trading and riskier bets.

Wireless mice use radio wave technology
JOSH BROWN
SciTech Editor
Computer mice, named 
so for their scurrying move-
ments, are the most interac-
tive features of modern-day 
computers. Wireless mice, in 
particular, allow us an ease 
of motion and use that wired 
technology just doesn’t allow. 
In this day and age, we have 
become so accustomed to 
moving mice about our desks 
that we often don’t think of 
the technology that goes into 
making this process a reality.
Wireless mice have two 
components: a transmitter 
and a receiver. The trans-
mitter is housed within the 
mouse itself, and the receiver 
plugs into the computer with 
which the mouse is interact-
ing. Transmitters encode the 
mouse’s movements as radio 
wave signals and transmit 
them to the receiver, that de-
codes the movement infor-
mation into a form which the 
computer can read and re-
spond to.
There are two main trans-
mitters used in computer 
mice: a rubber ball transmit-
ter and an LED transmitter. 
The rubber ball mechanism is 
outdated, as of now. The rub-
ber ball mouse has a rubber 
ball, similar to those found 
in mall vending machines, 
sticking out of its stomach. 
Within the mouse, next to the 
ball, are two vertical, plastic 
wheels with holes cut at in-
tervals along the sides. These 
plastic wheels correspond to 
directional axes, so there is 
one which measures horizon-
tal movement and one for ver-
tical movement. As you move 
the mouse, the rubber ball 
rolls and causes either one or 
both of these plastic wheels to 
turn. Depending on how far 
the mouse is moved, the wheel 
will turn a number of times. 
Each time the wheel turns, it 
interrupts a little beam of light 
within the mouse, and each 
interruption of this beam cor-
responds to a certain distance 
the mouse has been moved. 
This is how the computer 
translates the mouse’s physi-
cal movement into movement 
of the cursor on the screen. 
For Bluetooth systems, the 
most common mouse tech-
nology, the transmitter is a 
Bluetooth radio which allows 
the two devices to connect the 
mouse to a Bluetooth-enabled 
transceiver, like a computer.
Newer mice use a Light-
Emitting Diode (LED) mecha-
nism, whose movement is far 
more ?uid. Instead of a ball 
projecting from its belly, the 
LED mouse shines a bright 
light onto the surface upon 
which it’s being used. This 
light is then re?ected from 
the surface and back into 
the mouse. A chip within the 
mouse receives this re?ected 
light and translates it into 
movement data. The way 
an LED mouse measures its 
movement is by relating the 
mouse’s speed and distance 
traveled to the beam of light 
and the way it re?ects back 
into the mouse. The move-
ment data is then transmitted 
to the receiver attached to the 
computer and decoded in or-
der to move the cursor.
The receiver is a bit of 
hardware connected to the 
computer and paired with the 
mouse so it can receive the 
radio frequencies being trans-
mitted by the mouse. Pairing 
the two devices means making 
sure that they operate at the 
same radio frequency, and in 
doing so, cuts out interference 
from other radio communica-
tions and makes the connec-
tion safer and more reliable. 
In terms of security, some 
brands encrypt the mouse’s 
movement data or use fre-
quency-jumping techniques to 
lessen the chance of interfer-
ence from outside tampering 
— because really, what’s scar-
ier than a rogue mouse? There 
are many bene?ts to the use of 
radio technology for wireless 
mice, such as inexpensive and 
lightweight components, and 
a low power consumption. Ra-
dio waves, in comparison with 
the infrared technology used 
in remote controls, can also 
pass through obstacles such as 
a desk, so they add versatility 
in addition to ease of use.
While they may seem only 
a minor detail of one’s com-
puter interface, a mouse is es-
sentially a user’s right hand in 
many of his interactions with 
computers. Ensuring that it 
works, and works effortlessly, 
is a matter of good design and 
smart technology, and the 
more lightweight, accurate, 
and effortless mice become, 
the more effortless our inter-
actions with computers will 
become.
Carnegie Mellon student develops water puri?cation
JOSH BROWN
SciTech Editor
Water is a hot topic in 
today’s society. From the 
summer droughts that 
shook California, to the 
lead crisis in Flint, Michi-
gan, people across the na-
tion are suffering from the 
detriments of unsafe or 
unreliable water supplies. 
While these areas are 
suffering from a breakdown 
of preexisting water sys-
tems, there are many areas 
around the world whose wa-
ter systems have never been 
reliably clean. Adam Simp-
son, a senior chemical engi-
neering major, is looking to 
change that. 
Simpson’s biggest con-
cerns are particles called ni-
trates. Nitrates in excessive 
quantities can cause issues 
for marine ecosystems by im-
pairing immune and growth 
functions within aquatic life; 
high nitrate concentration 
within an aquatic system can 
even kill the ?sh in that area. 
“Nitrates should be below 
10 parts-per-million,” Simp-
son said. “There are places 
like the Santa Ana River that 
have nitrates of about 10-15 
parts-per-million.” 
A high nitrate presence 
is mostly caused by runoff 
from agricultural areas, es-
pecially those which use 
high-nitrate fertilizers. In 
these areas, this is not only 
an issue of clean water, but 
of clean soil as well. 
When it rains, water per-
colates down through the 
soil layers and can eventual-
ly reach freshwater systems 
like rivers or lakes. When 
this water runs through the 
soil, it picks up particles (in 
this case, nitrates) and fer-
ries them into the water 
system. 
Simpson’s parents own 
and operate Jamaica Wells 
and Services Ltd., a major 
water treatment plant, so he 
has long been surrounded 
by these issues as well as the 
people who are attempting 
to ?x them. 
His major research fo-
cus is the arti?cial wetlands 
created by water treatment 
plants like those owned by 
his parents.  
“Currently, in North Car-
olina, California, Florida, 
they have these things called 
wetlands, where the out?ow 
from wastewater treatment 
plants needs to be puri?ed,” 
Simpson said. “It’s not quite 
ready to be released into 
the environment.” This not-
quite-pure water needs to be 
?ltered in some way so that 
the harmful particles within 
it don’t leak out into the rest 
of the ecosystem. Simpson’s 
plan for water treatment is 
to use bio?lm and geotex-
tile technology to ?lter this 
water. 
A bio?lm is a group of 
cells that stick to something, 
or in colloquial terms, a 
slime. A geotextile is any sort 
of fabric which is embedded 
in the earth. Simpson’s ideal 
process incorporates “geo-
textiles impregnated with 
bio?lms and sand,” which 
will be able to “control the 
quality of the water that is 
going into rivers.” 
These bacteria, Simpson 
asserts, will be able to ex-
press nitrate-consuming en-
zymes, among other things. 
This will allow for a “natu-
rally inspired, sustainable 
water puri?cation process,” 
Simpson said. In order to 
make these plans a reality, 
Simpson took this past sum-
mer to conduct research 
with the Frank Sonnichsen 
group in Germany. This re-
search was part of the Ger-
man Academic Exchange 
Service’s Research Intern-
ships in Science and Engi-
neering (DAAD RISE). 
He has also been working 
closely with Danith Ly, an 
associate professor of chem-
istry at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, throughout the past 
three semesters. 
While the chemical engi-
neer may have a pretty solid 
path nowadays, it wasn’t al-
ways so stable. Simpson is a 
self-admitted “artistic per-
son,” who “would have gone 
to art school if the engineer-
ing thing didn’t work out.” 
His journey into chemi-
cal engineering began with 
an interest in chemistry, but 
after coming to college and 
?nding out that “chemical 
engineering really doesn’t 
have anything to do with 
chemistry,” he visualizes his 
future professional goals 
as falling more into envi-
ronmental and civil ?elds. 
HOW THINGS WORK

IntraFace software able to read emotion
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Staffwriter
When I stepped into the of-
?ce of Fernando De La Torre, 
an associate research profes-
sor in the Robotics Institute 
at Carnegie Mellon, the ?rst 
thing he did was pull me out of 
the room. He brought me one 
?ight down from his of?ce and 
into the lobby on the main ?oor 
of Smith Hall. 
Inside the lobby was a ma-
chine with a television screen 
that was mapping my move-
ments and displaying my state 
of emotion based on my ap-
pearance. When I smiled, it 
said “Happy, 98 percent;” when 
I stopped, it said “Neutral, 56 
percent;” when I remembered 
how much homework I had this 
past weekend, it said “Sad.”
This machine was not just 
guessing my emotions, but was 
algorithmically calculating 
them based on the appearance 
of my face to the screen. This 
machine is the counterpart 
to the one found in Newell-
Simon Hall. Installed in both 
machines is a special app 
called IntraFace, created by De 
La Torre alongside his team. 
This application is the result 
of 10 years of facial imaging 
research done by De La Torre, 
and it is capable of reading 
facial images in real time and 
computing a corresponding 
emotion based off changes in 
one’s facial structure. 
Generally, only humans 
and some animals are thought 
to understand emotions, but 
De La Torre and his team are 
adding robots to the list.
When ?rst assessing Intra-
Face, one of the ?rst questions 
De La Torre posed was “How 
can you make a computer 
understand human emotion?” 
He answered himself by say-
ing that the answer is twofold. 
The ?rst part involves ?nding 
a way to have the computer 
track the user’s facial compo-
nents so that it can determine 
their position in a vector space 
and read them. To do so, De La 
Torre developed software that 
allows the application to track 
facial muscles based on their 
conformation and location on 
the face. The process involved 
feeding the software thou-
sands of photos of facial com-
ponents and thousands of pho-
tos of non-facial components. 
Based on those initial in-
puts, the machine could then 
process what is a facial com-
ponent and what is not a facial 
component. To downsize the 
storage size of the software, De 
La Torre reduced the process-
ing algorithm to just four ma-
trix multiplications. 
This downsize is well within 
the memory storage capacity 
of a phone or other comput-
ing device, allowing IntraFace 
to be accessible across a wide 
array of electronic media.The 
second part of the answer to 
De La Torre’s question, and the 
more important part, involves 
developing a way to connect 
facial features to emotions in 
an algorithmic way that a com-
puter can understand. To ac-
complish this task, De La Torre 
and his research team fed the 
software thousands of photos 
with different facial structures 
and labeled them accordingly; 
smiling faces were labeled 
“Happy,” frowning faces were 
labeled “Sad.”
While expressions have 
far more psychologically and 
physiologically complex fea-
tures, there does exist a set of 
universal expressions, such as 
happiness, sadness, and sur-
prise, which look the same on 
everyone. This means that the 
same facial structures are used, 
and this universality allows 
researchers to use these broad 
categories. This is an instance 
of classi?cation, or the method 
of providing a machine an in-
dex (a list of facial expressions) 
from which it can develop a 
solution (stating whether the 
person is happy, sad, etc.). In 
classi?cation, a machine is 
given thousands of different 
observations, each with an ap-
propriate category. Using these 
observations, a machine can 
take an unknown observation 
and ?le it into a pre-existing 
category based on the list of 
categories it already contains. 
In the case of IntraFace, the 
observations are facial struc-
tures and the categories are 
emotions.
After elaborating on the 
technicalities of the software, 
De La Torre described some of 
the endless applications. For 
example, companies could use 
IntraFace in market advertis-
ing to assess the quality of their 
advertisements; they could see 
what parts of the advertise-
ment make people laugh, what 
parts bore them, and what 
parts completely disinterest 
them. Additionally, De La Torre 
mentioned integrating this 
software into vehicles to detect 
driver distraction. If vehicles 
had this software within them,

This schematic depicts the process by which IntraFace operates; its algorithms take into account spot-based tracking locations on the observed 
face, as well as the orientation of the face in space and the pose of the head. These spatial inputs are then recognized despite potential blockers like 
gender-based factors, facial hair, and eyewear, which might block facial detection. This range of observation allows IntraFace to be very accurate.

cars could detect when a 
driver is distracted or fatigued 
or texting based on the ex-
pression on his face. Another 
could be for public speaking, 
which would allow a lecturer 
to assess when his crowd is 
listening and engaged versus 
when it is tuning out or doz-
ing off. De La Torre even men-
tioned the possible medical 
applications of IntraFace; the 
app could allow doctors and 
other clinicians to determine 
how patients are feeling medi-
cally and if they are experienc-
ing any pain or discomfort. In 
order to advance the medici-
nal applications of InstaFace, 
De La Torre is currently part-
nering with Jeffrey Cohn, 
an Adjunct Professor of 
Computer Science at the Ro-
botics Institute at Carnegie 
Mellon and Professor of Psy-
chology and Psychiatry at the 
University of Pittsburgh. An-
other feature of IntraFace is 
that it is indiscriminate: it can 
read faces of any skin color as 
well as faces with facial hair of 
any kind. 
While the application has 
gained much ground over 
the past 10 years, De La Torre 
is hoping to develop it to a 
point where he can release it 
to researchers across the na-
tion as a practical research 
tool. IntraFace could provide 
researchers in the ?eld of psy-
chology, physiology, and com-
puter science with the tools to 
create breakthrough research.
SCITECH BRIEFS
Zika virus found to be sexually transmittable
In Dallas, Texas, health 
of?cials have reported the 
?rst case of a person infected 
with the Zika virus who has 
not traveled outside of the 
United States. 
Furthermore, the virus is 
said to have spread through 
sexual transmission. This 
has new implications for the 
control of the disease.
After being infected by 
mosquito bite in Venezuela, a 
traveler returned to his home 
in Colorado, where he trans-
mitted the virus to his wife. 
Several days later, the 
man and his wife both had 
symptoms of the virus, which 
were con?rmed through 
blood tests. 
While researchers did not 
test the man’s semen, they 
noted that the rest of the 
couple’s family did not con-
tract the disease.
Currently, there is a major 
outbreak of the disease in the 
Americas, and it is making its 
way to the U.S. 
The virus is suspected to 
be the cause for the increased 
cases of the neurological dis-
order microcephaly among 
newborns in Brazil. 
Recently, the Centers for 
Disease Control and Preven-
tion have issued guidelines 
advising people to use 
protection to prevent sexual 
transmission of the Zika virus.

Dead birds wash onto Alaskan shore; cause unknown
Abnormally large num-
bers of dead seabirds have 
appeared on the shores of 
Whittier, Alaska over the past 
several months. In early Janu-
ary, around 8,000 common 
murres, which make up the 
largest population of seabirds 
in the state, were swept ashore 
as a result of strong winds 
coming from the southeast. 
Scientists were puzzled when 
large numbers of these dead 
birds ?rst appeared in March 
of 2015 — the start of the 
breeding season when murre 
populations are typically in 
their prime.
According to experts in the 
Alaska branch of the U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service, a scarcity 
of food might have starved the 
common murres, depriving 
them of the energy needed to 
survive the extreme winds. It 
is also thought that saxitoxin, 
which induces amnesic shell-
?sh poisoning, might have 
contributed to some some of 
the deaths. Saxitoxin can be 
present in shell?sh, such as 
mussels, clams, and oysters, 
all of which comprise a piece 
of the murre’s diet. 
This toxin is thought to 
be the cause of some of these 
deaths, but it is hard to be 
sure, since it is dif?cult to de-
tect in birds without much in 
their stomachs, like the starv-
ing murres.

New collar helps reduce brain trauma in athletes
After numerous animal 
studies, researchers are set to 
begin human trials on a collar 
that could reduce brain trauma 
during impacts, such as col-
lisions which occur during 
football. 
The device, a u-shaped col-
lar that wraps comfortably 
around the neck, works by 
increasing blood?ow to the 
brain, thus providing a larger 
amount of cushioning and de-
creasing brain impact with the 
skull. 
The device alters blood-
?ow by slightly reducing the 
amount of blood exiting the 
brain after each heartbeat. 
This is a grand develop-
ment for the athletic industry 
because brain trauma has be-
come a rampant concern in 
many sports cultures. 
Football especially has seen 
an alarming number of brain 
trauma cases; last year, Front-
line reported evidence from a 
Brown University study that 
from a sample of 91 former 
NFL players, 87 (96 percent) of 
them showed signs of chronic 
traumatic encephalopathy 
(CTE), a degenerative brain 
disorder which can cause 
emotional defects, as well as 
memory loss. 
Hopefully, if this collar en-
ters full production, it will be 
able help cut down on these 
alarming statistics.

U.S. deems three-parent babies ethically passable
An Institute of Medicine 
panel, which was formed at 
the request of the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration 
(FDA), has concluded that 
it is ethically permissible to 
make “three-parent babies” 
for clinical experimentation, 
given that a set of criteria are 
met. These babies are created 
using mitochondrial replace-
ment therapy in order to pre-
vent the inheritance of rare 
genetic diseases which affect 
mitochondria, such as autism.
Since about one in 20 people 
with autism have mitochon-
drial dysfunction, while only 
one in 4000 people in the gen-
eral population have the dis-
ease. Mitochrondrial disorder 
may have a role in autism 
contraction.
In mitochondrial transfer, 
which has already been ap-
proved in the United King-
dom, the nucleus from the 
mother’s egg is inserted into 
a health donor egg, previ-
ously stripped of its original 
nucleus. 
An embryo is formed when 
researchers fertilize the mod-
i?ed egg with the sperm of 
the father. 
As a result, the embryo 
would contain a combination 
of DNA from the three par-
ties, but it would be made of 
mostly genetic information 
from the mother and father.

Loudspeaker adapts to environment, helps vocal clarity
German researchers, op-
erating out of the Oldenburg-
based Project Group Hearing, 
Speech, and Audio Technology of 
the Faunhofer Institute of Digital 
Media Technology IDMT, have 
created a software that makes 
it easier for speech to be heard 
in noisy environments, includ-
ing loudspeaker announce-
ments at railway stations. 
Their Adapt Dynamic Range 
Compression (DRC) software 
employs a microphone that 
continually analyzes the noise 
of the environment, adjusting 
speech accordingly. 
While similar tech-
nologies exist, high vol-
umes from speakers can be 
incomprehensible. 
The researchers’ software is 
designed so that consonants, 
which involve short and high 
frequencies, are reinforced in 
sound. Additionally, DRC soft-
ens the loud parts and ampli-
?es the soft parts of speech. 
The combination of these 
techniques allow for improved 
intelligibility of speech and 
the prevention of potential 
miscommunication. 
The software utilizes natu-
ral voice dynamic observations 
to amplify naturally quiet parts 
of speech and diminish natu-

Exoskeleton can help paralyzed individuals walk
A mechanical engineering 
professor from the Robot-
ics and Human Engineering 
Laboratory in the University 
of California, Berkeley, has 
recently released a new, light-
er, and more agile exoskeleton 
named The Phoenix.
A product of SuitX, a 
company that emerged 
from the robotics lab, the 
exoskeleton incorporates 
two motors positioned at the 
hips as well as tension set-
tings — which are electrically 
controlled — that adjust to 
the movement of the wearer’s 
legs. Part of the exoskeleton 
involves a pair of clutches 
with buttons that can enable 
the user to control the move-
ment and speed of the legs. 
The user also wears 
a backpack containing a 
battery pack that can last 
from four to eight hours.The 
Phoenix is currently one of 
the lightest and most acces-
sible exoskeletons commer-
cially available. At $40,000, 
The Phoenix is competitively 
priced when compared to 
similar exoskeletons, which 
cost approximately twice as 
much.  While prohibitively ex-
pensive for most, this devel-
opment does have promising 
applications.

Should the U.S. build icebreakers, create trade routes?
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
As we shift into the 21st 
century, the capabilities of our 
infrastructure to adapt to the 
changes in climate and the re-
sultant changes in geography. 
The most notable of these 
shifts is the melting and 
thinning of polar ice caps. Pres-
ident Obama has mandated 
a ?eet of ten new icebreaker 
ships, which he deems neces-
sary to bene?t the future eco-
nomic and physical security of 
America as an arctic nation. 
This week, Pugwash dis-
cussed the variety of effects 
these icebreakers could have.
An icebreaker is a boat that can 
break up ice-covered water and 
allow safe passage for ships. 
Icebreakers are built such that 
they are able to maintain mod-
erate speeds despite heavily 
reinforced hulls and the weight 
that they add. This allows them 
to easily submerge and crack 
thin ice.
When dealing with thicker 
ice, they sometimes will break 
the ice by repeatedly back-
ing up and ramming it. Their 
thick hulls make them resilient 
to such collisions. The most 
obvious need for icebreak-
ers is economic. Now that it 
is easier to navigate the Polar 
Regions, trade routes could 
emerge north of Canada. This 
could open up access to new 
energy sources in the Arctic. 
New trade routes could also 
make shipments of things like 
fuel and food to residents of 
Canada and parts of Alaska 
possible, raising quality of life 
for those citizens. 
The problem is that 
icebreakers take about ten 
years to build, and each costs 
about one billion dollars. 
Getting pennies out of 
Congress’s piggy bank has been 
impossible in recent years. One 
solution that has been put 
forward by James G. Stavridis 
of the Wall Street Journal is 
“wet leases,” a common deal 
in the shipping industry where 
the United States contracts-out 
icebreakers, and the owner of 
the ship provides both the ship 
and the crew. 
The ship is then under the 
control of the United States 
Coast Guard. Another possibil-
ity, according to Jen Judson of 
POLITICO, includes a current 
study of the capabilities of 
Canadian and Finnish ?rms 
to create icebreakers. Further, 
increased Arctic infrastructure 
has caused the temperature in 
the Arctic to rise at twice the 
rate of the rest of the world ac-
cording to Slate’s Eric Holthaus. 
Without the bright white ice 
re?ecting light, the darker wa-
ter absorbs temperature more 
quickly. Breaking up the ice 
makes it easier for the ice to 
melt and also easier for the sur-
rounding region to get warmer. 
Climate change and rising 
sea levels present a host of 
economic problems: from the 
destruction of coastal cities via 
?ooding and storms to weather 
events that make agricultural 
products more dif?cult to culti-
vate. The second pressing need 
behind icebreakers is security. 
According to Holthaus, Russia 
and its ?eet of 42 icebreakers 
have started claiming oil ?elds 
and other bits of infrastructure 
throughout the Arctic, in-
cluding claiming a piece of 
land previously claimed by 
Denmark. Russia’s expansion-
ism has already led to con?icts 
in Georgia, Chechnya, Ukraine, 
and is now escalating tensions 
in Syria. When NATO countries 
like Denmark and Norway are 
in Russia’s sights, this could 
signi?cantly raise the threat for 
escalation. 
With Russia and NATO con-
ducting military training exer-
cises mere yards from each oth-
er along Russia’s border with 
the Baltic States and tensions 
at a post-Cold War high, raising 
the stakes by bullying NATO 
states puts the world in a scary 
position. The United States 
having an icebreaker ?eet to 
help allies control regions they 
have very little physical control 
over could help prevent Rus-
sia’s expansionist tendencies 
from beginning World War III. 
However, the United States get-
ting into contests with Russia 
has come very close to ending 
the world before. It might not 
be best to get into an arms race, 
even if the arms are much less 
dangerous. It seems our mili-
tary and economic needs dic-
tate we expand our icebreaker 
?eet and do it as quickly and 
cost effectively as possible, but 
expanding icebreaker ?eets in 
a limited fashion may prevent 
many of the pressing issues.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational orga-
nization that discusses the 
implications of science. This ar-
ticle is a summary of last week’s 
discussion on icebreaker ships.

Simpson’s professors, he 
said, were integral in the 
development of his goals. “I 
took organic chemistry with 
Professor Ly, and I really 
liked his approach. He didn’t 
just want us to get the A, but 
he wanted us to discover 
through intuition.” Simpson 
maintains that a diverse 
class repertoire is important 
for college students.“A lot of 
people have the belief that in 
the engineering and scienc-
es, you can’t have fun choos-
ing your classes,” Simpson 
said. “Some people don’t 
want to take a Psychology 
class because they don’t 
think it will be good for their 
career.” But Simpson’s view 
is that a variety of classes 
have helped him decide 
what he really wanted to do. 
“I think that just following 
the path of what you’re in-
terested in will direct you to 
where you ought to go. 
Use Carnegie Mellon in 
the best way possible.” Since 
Carnegie Mellon is such a 
small university, there is 
much more of an allowance 
to  “establish a relationship 
with professors who are ac-
tually doing stuff.” These 
relationships, Simpson 
believes, “will take you  far.”

The 2016 presidential nomina-
tions are supposed to be all locked 
up. Secretary Hillary Clinton is 
supposed to sail to the Democrat-
ic nomination untouched. After 
months of hoping beyond hope, 
pundits have ?nally resigned to 
businessman Donald Trump’s sur-
prising inevitability. There’s only 
one problem: nobody told Iowa.
On Monday, the Iowa Caucuses 
didn’t quite go as planned. Despite 
a Quinnipiac poll the day of the 
caucus showing Trump seven points 
ahead of Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX), 
Cruz cruised to an easy three-point 
victory. Trump barely ?nished sec-
ond over Senator Marco Rubio 
(R-FL), who performed surpris-
ingly well. On the Democratic side, 
Senator Bernie Sanders (D-VT) and 
Clinton were deadlocked all night. 
In fact, Clinton wasn’t declared the 
victor until the next day, and some 
precincts were even decided by coin 
?ip. It was literally a toss-up.
In terms of nominating dele-
gates, Iowa is almost meaningless. 
Thanks to his win, Cruz now has 
eight delegates for the Republican 
nominating convention this sum-
mer. Trump and Rubio both have 
seven. They need 1,237 to win the 
nomination. Clinton has 23 del-
egates and Sanders has 21. They 
need 2,382 to win their party’s 
nomination. Iowa’s real signi?cance 
comes from the media coverage it 
generates. As the ?rst presidential 
primary election in the nation, the 
Iowa Caucuses aren’t about where 
a candidate places. Rather, what 
matters is how candidates perform 
relative to the expectations sur-
rounding them.
Trump was the night’s big Re-
publican loser. Expectations sur-
rounding him were huge. He looked 
weak in Iowa for a while, but he 
had surged there the week before 
the primary, buoyed by high-pro?le 
endorsements and effective attacks 
against Cruz. So when Trump bare-
ly escaped with second place, his 
campaign seemed to have drastical-
ly underperformed, and suddenly 
he didn’t look so invincible.
Coming in ?rst was a big win for 
Cruz, especially when the most re-
cent poll showed him down in the 
polls signi?cantly. However, Cruz 
was long considered the favorite 
in Iowa, thanks to his evangelical 
bona ?des and Iowa-centric cam-
paign strategy, so he didn’t exceed 
expectations so much as meet them.
Despite coming in third, Marco 
Rubio was the GOP’s biggest win-
ner. Rubio, who is Catholic, while 
most Iowa Republicans are evan-
gelical protestants, wasn’t polling 
well in Iowa. Considered one of the 
race’s relative moderates (if such a 
thing exists in today’s GOP), Rubio 
was vulnerable in Iowa thanks to 
his voting history on immigration 
and his lack of campaign infra-
structure in the state. When Rubio 
outperformed polling and nearly 
overtook Trump, he far exceeded 
expectations, he emerged as the 
clear front-runner among estab-
lishment Republicans, and he dom-
inated the news cycle. Now it looks 
possible, if not probable, that Rubio 
will be the Republican nominee.
Virtually tying with Hillary 
Clinton was a huge win for Bernie 
Sanders. Three months ago, Sand-
ers was 20 points behind Clinton in 
Iowa. The day before the caucus, 
polling still showed him four points 
behind. By tying with Clinton, 
Sanders proved that he is a viable 
candidate with the campaign infra-
structure needed to actually get the 
vote and win. By generating higher-
than-average turnout, he showed 
that he can generate real excite-
ment and convert that excitement 
into actual votes. Sanders de?ed 
expectations, as he has done this 
entire campaign.
Now, he has built up serious mo-
mentum. After tying with Clinton 
in Iowa, Sanders announced that 
he had out-fundraised Clinton by 
$5 million in January, powered by 
thousands of small-dollar dona-
tions. On Friday, a new Quinnipiac 
poll showed Sanders just 2 percent 
behind Clinton nationally, eras-
ing a 30 percent lead that Clinton 
held in the same poll just six weeks 
earlier. Polling 20 points ahead of 
Clinton in New Hampshire, Sand-
ers is poised to take an early, com-
manding lead in the race. With key 
endorsements pouring in and lift-
ing his chances for performing well 
among minority voters in South 
Carolina and Nevada, the electoral 
math keeps looking more and more 
promising for Sanders.
If the Iowa Caucuses were the 
only point of reference, the presi-
dential election would look sig-
ni?cantly different from how it 
has been portrayed in the media. 
Inevitable candidates don’t tie with 
their rivals. Unstoppable candi-
dates don’t come in second, almost 
third. The Caucuses were a huge 
turning point in this race because 
they threw all expectations out the 
window. You had one job, Iowa, 
and you blew it. Now, this election 
might just be interesting after all.

Iowa Caucuses shift 2016 election terrainAfter the devastating November 
terrorist attacks carried out in loca-
tions around Paris, French president 
François Hollande had all eyes on 
him to respond creatively and ef-
fectively. He initially impressed the 
world with his compassion, choos-
ing to allow 30,000 Syrian refugees 
into France. But at the dawn of the 
new year, Hollande announced a 
proposed constitutional amend-
ment that would allow France to 
strip the citizenship of anyone con-
victed of terrorist acts, provided 
that they have additional citizen-
ship elsewhere. 
There has been resistance to 
the amendment from all sides, 
with some saying it does not go 
far enough and should include 
even those who only have French 
citizenship, and others saying the 
amendment is an infringement on 
civil liberties and is, in its current 
form, racist. Of interest to The Tar-
tan, however, are the philosophical 
questions raised here; does this de-
value the concept of the nation? If 
a country can choose to disown its 
citizens, it may not be ful?lling its 
end of the “social contract.”
French Enlightenment philoso-
pher Rousseau believed that a na-
tion and its citizens engage in a con-
tract, in which the individual gives 
himself and his rights over to the the 
community in exchange for shared 
equality, protection, and mutual aid. 
In keeping with this, France has al-
ways embraced a broad social safety 
net. Each citizen works toward the 
common good of the whole, and 
the nation is strengthened by this 
community mentality. In return, ev-
eryone reaps various social bene?ts 
such as education, health care, and 
a vast availability of subsidies. An 
example of this is the subsidy that 
parents receive per child. In return, 
parents are expected to teach these 
children French morals and values, 
to help other government structures 
such as public schools to actively 
perpetuate French culture.
This creates two complications. 
The ?rst is that, within this context, 
terrorism becomes a much more 
severe offense against the nation. 
Someone who has reaped the ben-
e?ts of the state has not ful?lled his 
or her end of the bargain. If we were 
speaking in terms of an actual legal 
contract, this would be grounds for 
termination. From a purely philo-
sophical perspective, this seems just.
Except this is not an actual legal 
contract. It’s a philosophy that the 
government spoon feeds to its youth 
that, in reality, does have bene?ts. 
Yet, it is unrealistic to expect that 
everyone in a nation the size of Tex-
as should believe in a single uni?ed 
belief about the role of the nation. 
Then this clash of philosophy and 
reality gets even more convoluted 
in that the proposed amendment 
openly targets the French Arab im-
migrant population. These are the 
people that are most likely to have 
dual citizenship, and Hollande is 
implying that France’s Arab im-
migrants are the primary suspects 
of terror.
For decades France has disen-
franchised this entire sector of its 
population. Relations only began 
with France conquering their na-
tions, brutalizing and exploiting 
their people, and then ?ghting them 
in deadly wars of independence. But 
current ?rst and second generation 
French-born Arabs have faced con-
siderable discrimination. In 2012, 
France enacted the public burqa 
ban, which makes law the assump-
tion that either a woman wearing 
one is a public safety risk or is being 
oppressed by a male. This law that 
both aims to come to these women’s 
aid and protect France’s secular val-
ues just ended up disregarding the 
culture and history behind veiling.
A large fraction of this popu-
lation has also been relegated to 
France’s “banlieues,” which literally 
translates to suburbs, but is not the 
American idea of suburbs. These 
are essentially France’s version of 
the projects, unkempt apartment 
buildings that the government rents 
to low-income immigrant families. 
They’re notable for their terrible 
public education because very few 
teachers are capable of effectively 
delivering the rigid national curric-
ulum to a class that the Ministry of 
Education does not consider when 
it makes these plans. The banlieues 
are also known for their crime and 
riots against police. 
The argument that dual-citi-
zen, which in reality mostly means 
Arab, terrorists are not deserving 
citizenship because they violated 
the social contract begins to fall 
apart when you consider these 
conditions. Most ?rst- and second-
generation French Arabs aren’t re-
ceiving the education, protection, 
and shared equality Rousseau and 
the French government promised.
This is a long and ongoing his-
tory. But what’s more telling is the 
pro?le of the French youth who 
have been radicalizing via the Inter-
net and moving to Syria to join ISIS. 
There is de?nitely a large number of 
radicalizers that come from troubled 
banlieue families. But recently Arab 
youth outside of the banlieues, from 
loving middle class families, have 
been disappearing unexpectedly to 
join the Jihad. There’s a reason for 
this. France treats its Arab popula-
tion like second-class citizens, and 
if this amendment is voted into the 
constitution, some will cease to be 
citizens at all. While an individual 
committing an act of terrorism de-
serves severe punishment, expelling 
such people from the citizenry ig-
nores the larger issue at hand.
France had an opportunity after 
the Friday the 13th Paris attacks. 
The nation could have decided to 
view it as a wake-up call. After the 
necessary mourning period, they 
should have elected to follow the 
same path that they began when 
welcoming the refugees. It would 
have been a great chance to make 
the kind of progressive immigration 
reform that we expect from a social-
ist candidate like Hollande. Yet he 
swung the pendulum so far back to 
the right, adopting an all-too-Amer-
ican attitude of Islamophobia.
No one should be modeling their 
immigration decisions after Ameri-
ca. We’ve already been clandestine-
ly pushing the boundaries of what 
rights American terrorists have un-
der the guise of the Patriot Act and 
Guantanamo Bay. It is very Ameri-
can to respond to the threat of terror 
by stripping rights and showing an 
obvious fear and hatred for the en-
emy. Not only is this wrong for the 
French population, it’s also disap-
pointing that this is the product of 
Hollande’s desire to protect his citi-
zens and preserve their culture. He 
swung far away from Rousseau and 
straight into Trump territory.
France cannot continue to treat 
its population like a homogenous 
community anymore. So much 
has changed since 1762. A nation 
has different responsibilities to its 
citizens, and the concept of a 21st-
century citizen is still yet to be de-
termined. France owes it to its Arab 
population to propose meaningful 
cultural change, not institutional-
ized discrimination.
France moves to disown citizens, undermines state

ARIEL HOFFMAIER
When I was a sixteen-year-old 
budding feminist still afraid of the 
label, I wrote a research paper that at-
tempted to disprove virginity. It was a 
“construct,” I argued — a sexist, het-
eronormative box that society invent-
ed to restrain and shame women’s ex-
pression of their sexuality. Like many 
millennial feminists, I was proudly 
“sex positive.”
Following the second-wave doc-
trine of free love, I supported all 
women’s freedom to have as much 
and as wild sex as they saw ?t. I ral-
lied against slut-shaming, a sexual 
double-standard that calls promis-
cuous men “players” and women 
“hoes.” Anything from kink to porn to 
sex work was fair game as long as it 
followed the BDSM golden rule: safe, 
sane, and — most importantly — con-
sensual. Sex was fun, after all. It was 
one of the most natural and beautiful 
things people could do.
But nothing is that simple. Four 
years and a few rude awakenings lat-
er, I’ve realized that sex positivity — a 
philosophy followed religiously by so 
many well-meaning feminists — is far 
from a perfect ?x for society’s toxic re-
lationship with sexuality.
Nowhere is this toxicity more evi-
dent than in the never-ending debate 
over prostitution, the so-called “old-
est profession in the world” and quite 
possibly the most controversial. It’s il-
legal everywhere in the United States 
besides some parts of Nevada, but 
that doesn’t mean it’s not thriving. 
Research indicates that the under-
ground commercial sex trade exists 
in virtually every state, nets many bil-
lions a year, and provides pimps with 
weekly pro?ts as high as $30,000.
Sex-positive feminists draw a 
hard line between sex work, the 
consensual selling of sex between 
adults, and sex traf?cking, the kid-
napping or otherwise forcing of pri-
marily women and children into the 
sex trade. They generally argue for a 
crackdown on sex traf?cking along 
with the widespread legalization of 
prostitution. In a hugely controversial 
report published last year, Amnesty 
International — one of the ?rst and 
most prominent global human rights 
organizations — of?cially came out 
in support of this stance. They cited 
many common, and extremely valid, 
arguments of the pro-prostitution 
camp: decriminalization shifts lim-
ited police resources from sex work-
ers to traf?cking victims; it frees sex 
workers to demand safer working 
conditions, more economic autono-
my, and protection of the law against 
abusive pimps and clients; and, if 
anything, it decreases the size of the 
industry. Meanwhile, criminalization 
does not eliminate prostitution or 
“save” prostitutes. On the contrary, it 
drives both underground into darker, 
seedier corners. By con?ating prosti-
tution with traf?cking, it patronizes 
women working in the sex industry 
by choice while failing to help the real 
victims.
For a glimpse of the other side, 
we don’t have to look further than 
one highly publicized response to 
the Amnesty International policy: a 
scathing open letter signed by doz-
ens of human rights organizations 
and big-pro?le celebrities, including 
white feminists Lena Dunham, 
Anne Hathaway, and Meryl 
Streep. This letter decries 
the sex industry on prin-
ciple as both the product 
of and a perpetuator of 
gender inequality. In the 
anti-prostitution camp, 
“sex work” is a con-
tradiction in terms 
because all pros-
titutes are akin to 
sex slaves. This 
camp’s primary ar-
guments rest on the 
frightening reality of 
prostitutes’ lives. The 
majority are pulled into 
the trade as teenagers, usually 
runaways or wards of the state with a 
history of abuse. They are often com-
pletely economically dependent on 
pimps. They experience ubiquitous 
sexual, physical, and psychological 
violence from pimps and johns alike. 
Even when they are raped, they can 
expect no retribution from the law. 
In fact, they are arrested far more of-
ten than either those who sell or buy 
their bodies. Marginalized popula-
tions, especially poor minorities, are 
disproportionately represented in 
the industry. Across the board, pros-
titutes are at high risk of substance 
addiction, STDs, mental illnesses (es-
pecially PTSD), and homicide. The 
mortality rate of the industry is such 
common knowledge, and prostitutes 
are so stigmatized, that “dead hook-
er” remains a punch line.
Both sides have valid points, but 
they’re so dedicated to destroying 
each other that they refuse to see the 
issue as anything other than black 
and white. Each cherry-picks, slants, 
and manufactures evidence to sup-
port their side. Though some statisti-
cal manhandling is inevitable in any 
contentious issue, I actually had a 
very hard time ?nding statistics that 
weren’t af?liated with some “pro” or 
“anti-prostitution” stronghold. Many 
studies predominantly or even exclu-
sively interview police of?cers, pimps, 
and rescued sex traf?cking victims. 
Often excluded from these stud-
ies are sex workers by choice, who 
would reap heavy bene?ts from de-
criminalization. Consequently, many 
sex workers have 
criticized leading anti-
prostitution advocates 
— such as the celebri-
ties who responded to 
Amnesty International 
— for misrepresenting 
their experiences.
These are the women who sex-
positive feminists imagine when they 
support the legalization of prostitu-
tion: women who deserve to make 
a living however they choose, free 
from judgment and protected by the 
law. But here again we must question 
what it means to “freely choose” sex 
work. Just as consent by coercion is 
not really consent at all, can margin-
alized and abused and impoverished 
women really choose prostitution 
when they have few better options?
It seems dif?cult, if not impos-
sible, to separate “good” from “bad” 
sex work without further victimizing 
women. No one should be surprised 
that prostitution is a dangerous job, 
even for those who choose it. But 
there’s also no substantial proof that 
blanket bans on prostitution don’t 
harm more than help. Despite all 
the idealism and well wishes in the 
world, this many-billion-dollar indus-
try isn’t going anywhere. This is espe-
cially true because advocates on both 
sides far more often address the sup-
ply of sex than society’s unquench-
able demand for it, a demand fueled 
by rampant misogyny and the com-
mercialization of women’s bodies.
This demand is further bolstered 
by pornography, another contro-
versial sexual commodity generally 
supported by sex-positive feminists. 
Research hasn’t yet reached a con-
sensus on whether porn is addictive, 
despite the gargantuan efforts of 
websites like “YourBrainon-
Porn” which claim that 
it can be as damaging 
as alcohol or gam-
bling. Like drug ad-
dicts who develops 
a tolerance, many 
chronic porn users 
report a compulsion 
to view videos of sex acts 
that are increasingly far from “va-
nilla.” Probably the eighth command-
ment of sex positivity is “don’t kink-
shame,” but there’s still something 
very wrong with a society that doesn’t 
blink an eye at whole categories of 
PornHub videos dedicated to “teen,” 
“humiliation,” “abuse,” and “rape.” 
The normalization of such extreme 
pornography, even if performed by 
consenting adults, normalizes in turn 
an often violently misogynistic view 
of sexuality. While “feminist porn” 
is a beacon of light, demonstrating 
what porn could and should be, the 
mainstream porn industry continues 
to thrive, inevitably encouraging mi-
sogynists to bring harmful fantasies 
to life. In so many of these videos, 
women are objecti?ed and abused 
and — most damning of all — they 
like it.
Plus, the sex positivity movement 
provides men with a “pro-feminist” 
excuse to pressure women into sex 
that they’re supposed to want and en-
joy. Think of all the men who’ve snap-
chatted unsolicited dick pics, who’ve 
pushed a drunken make-out into as-
sault, who’ve refused to accept rejec-
tion, even to the point of violence. 
Imagine all these men with Robin 
Thicke in the background, smirk-
ing and crooning again and again: 
“I know you want it.” To these men, 
a sex-positive woman should be in fa-
vor of all sex, anytime, with anyone. 
She should not — or even cannot — 
turn them down.
Sex positivity shouts from the 
mountaintops about women’s free-
dom to enthusiastically consent. But 
it needs to place equal emphasis on 
her right to say no. Not wanting sex, 
in the moment or ever, is normal too, 
and any implication to the contrary 
erases women on the asexuality spec-
trum. After all, the implicit message 
of sex positivity’s “it’s natural” motto 
is that if you don’t want sex, there’s 
something wrong with you. This 
feeds smoothly into stereotypes that 
asexual, or ace, people are broken, 
unfeeling, even inhuman. Not only 
is this kind of thinking often used to 
justify corrective rape, but it’s horri-
bly detrimental to the self-esteem of 
women who feel little to no sexual 
attraction or drive, especially those 
who are naturally sex-repulsed or ex-
periencing sex repulsion in the trau-
matic aftermath of sexual assault.
The sex positivity movement has 
chipped away at many women’s 
shame in their own desires, and al-
lowed them to explore their sexual-
ity with less internalized and societal 
judgment. It has underlined consent 
as the foundation for all healthy sex-
ual expression. It has helped to nor-
malize what was once widely consid-
ered deviant, particularly same-sex 
relationships. Thanks to sex positiv-
ity, queer people are more widely 
accepted and better educated about 
their sexuality.
But sex positivity is not a move-
ment without victims. Those hurt 
most aren’t sexually explorative col-
lege feminists, but women at the 
fringes of society — sex traf?cking 
victims, prostitutes and porn actors 
who’ve known little else but abuse 
and exploitation. On a free-loving, 
freewheeling train where everyone 
gets off and no one gets hurt, these 
are the women thrown under the 
tracks. Not all sex is fun and natural 
and beautiful; a good deal of it is rape 
or coercion or the result of intense 
pressure from every corner of a hy-
per-sexualized culture.
We shouldn’t throw the baby out 
with the bathwater here, but ulti-
mately we need to take a long hard 
look at the giant sea of grey area that 
the sex positivity movement cannot 
escape. Countless women are in des-
perate need of such a reevaluation. 
Let’s listen to them.

TARTANS TALK
Prostitution, porn, identity throw wrench in sex positivity     
Race unrelated to Oscar nominations, purely talent based 
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Staffwriter
Two weeks ago I read an article in 
The Tartan’s Forum section discussing 
the Oscars, which argued that perva-
sive racism was connected to the list 
of Oscar nominees, all of whom were 
white. The Oscar nominations also 
generated a movement and atten-
tion online, with the hashtag #Os-
carsSoWhite spreading across Twit-
ter. Many people believe that the lack 
of black or other minority actors on 
the list is a result of racism plaguing 
society, and I completely disagree.
When I watch a movie, I don’t 
judge an actor by what color his skin 
is. It’s disingenuous to even associate 
skin color with talent: an actor is nei-
ther talented nor untalented because 
he is white, and the same corollary 
applies to actors of any skin color. 
In my opinion, an actor is talented if 
he can convey emotion through his 
character and capture his audience 
with such depth that viewers forget 
they’re watching a movie and feel 
like they themselves are part of the 
story. Whether an actor is capable of 
doing that or not has nothing to do 
with their skin color. Yes, the list of 
nominees contains all white actors, 
but how does that re?ect anything 
about their quality of acting, and how 
is this a social justice issue that activ-
ists deem necessary to respond to?
A notion called unconscious rac-
ism has arisen in response to the Os-
cars issue and other areas of social 
justice activism. The idea is that a 
person can be racist based on sub-
conscious perceptions of race that 
he is not even aware of. Applying 
this notion to the Oscar nominees, 
some people believe that Academy 
voters — and more generally, people 
— unconsciously associate good act-
ing with white skin. I don’t associ-
ate good acting with being white, 
because being a good actor doesn’t 
mean being white, or black, or Asian, 
or any ethnicity. Period. It means hav-
ing talent and evoking an emotional 
response in your viewers. Labeling 
the Oscar nominations racist because 
they failed to deem an actor of color 
worthy of the nomination for one of 
the most prestigious and competitive 
awards in acting is contrived. Hun-
dreds of quality actors and actresses 
— including white ones — don’t re-
ceive nominations, and thousands 
more don’t even receive the celebrity, 
fame, and wealth associated with 
Hollywood. The actors that did re-
ceive nominations portrayed enough 
talent to do so, and this talent has 
nothing to do with skin color.
The #OscarsSoWhite issue is re-
ally just a subset of a larger mindset 
in America, one in which people are 
quick to adhere to media headlines 
portraying race issues and heighten-
ing racial tension. I am genuine and 
serious in my belief of the principles 
of equality and equal opportunity, 
regardless of race, sex, or color. How-
ever, sensationalizing ideas like #Os-
carsSoWhite and creating racial ten-
sion over things that aren’t related 
to race divide and de?ne people by 
their skin color, which goes against 
the very principles of equality social 
justice critics seek to uphold.

CaPS does vital work,  services must expand
ZEKE ROSENBERG
I have never had a particularly 
easy time falling asleep. Even when 
I was a child, I remember staying 
up until the clock hit 9, then 10, 
then hours no little kid should ever 
be awake for until I either slipped 
into a short nap or morning came. 
The problem never eased up as I got 
older, but as I started to reach adult-
hood it shifted from silent waiting to 
a series of uncomfortable thoughts 
to an internal screaming match just 
trying to get my brain to calm down 
for just one minute and let me sleep. 
From there it only escalated. It’s 
hard to remember when each shift 
happened, but eventually this was 
no longer just a bedtime scourge. 
My whole day became a ?ght with 
myself. Over time it shifted into an 
internal ?ght with someone else. It 
made me angry, but I never really 
felt anything amiss until the middle 
of a ?nal last year.
I sat taking a test in a class I was 
taking pass/fail, needing merely a 
20 percent to slip by. As I sat in the 
room and tried to focus, this voice 
became loud and angrier than nor-
mal. As I stumbled through the ?rst 
problem on the exam, it began to 
taunt me. It began to get more and 
more aggressive until, for the ?rst 
time, it threatened me.
I was confused and panicked. 
I handed in my exam with just the 
one problem ?nished and looked 
for the nearest empty spot. That 
happened to be the stairs between 
the Morewood Parking Lot and 
WQED. I pulled out my phone and 
called the campus mental health 
emergency number, lying that I had 
just had a panic attack. I don’t quite 
remember what the person on the 
other line said, but I managed to get 
all the way to my apartment before I 
began crying hysterically. 
I decided I needed some sort of 
company. The voice in my head kept 
taunting me that I had somehow 
managed to miss such a meager 
goal on that ?nal, and I just needed 
something else to focus on. I some-
how never managed to contact any-
one and wound up at home assem-
bling IKEA furniture for six hours 
that felt like months. Eventually I 
did manage to ?nd my phone to ask 
someone to come help build a coffee 
table, but I never quite recovered.
I still have a nightmare of a time 
just sitting down and doing home-
work for extended periods of time. 
Getting to class in the morning is a 
nightmare, and I often fall really far 
behind in terms of material. Carn-
egie Mellon’s Disability Services are 
extremely helpful for these symp-
toms, but getting myself to class in 
the morning would be a more per-
sonally meaningful step then hav-
ing free access to copy machines for 
notes and ?exible testing hours.
I eventually sought help — I had 
to, there was no way around it — 
through Carnegie Mellon’s Coun-
seling and Psychological Services, 
or CaPS, which sent me “into the 
community” as they always do with 
people with problems they are not 
designed to handle. That’s prob-
ably the best solution, but there are 
three hurdles involved in seeking 
the necessary care in that situation.
First, a lack of motivation is 
among the most common symp-
toms of any mental illness. While 
CaPS is right on campus and not 
far removed from most people’s 
daily activities, places like UPMC’s 
Services for the Treatment of Early 
Psychosis (STEP) are comparatively 
far away and, when in the wrong 
mindset, can be explained away by 
anything from the weather to the 
bus taking too long to just plain not 
wanting to go.
Second, mental health treat-
ment can be exorbitantly expensive. 
Copayments at each visit if not in a 
set program mean that six weeks of 
therapy can cost $250. That’s not 
within the budget of most people, 
especially college students.
Third, white coat syndrome can 
be a serious concern. Every time 
I go into STEP and am asked what 
the voice sounds like or what it says, 
I’m met with loud resistance inside 
my head to saying anything speci?c. 
Despite being able to talk about it 
freely in other situations, I’ve never 
been able to describe the problem 
when I’m actually inside a medical 
institution. White coat syndrome is 
very common and probably plays a 
large role. The on-campus environ-
ment of CaPS could be better for 
sharing information that needs to 
be shared.
Pittsburgh is an excellent city in 
terms of mental health care. Most 
places don’t have something close 
to an equivalent for STEP and don’t 
have the abundance of mental 
health care resources. CaPS itself is 
also a program ideal for a university; 
it is designed to deal with the men-
tal health problems that may come 
up for college students. An intuitive 
solution seems to be to have Carn-
egie Mellon contract professionals 
who could help students with less 
common problems through CaPS, 
but there are probably obstacles 
to that I could not think of. I don’t 
have the knowledge to provide a so-
lution, just to start a conversation in 
hopes that someone else does.

New “diverse” Barbies blur lines between fun toy, bad role model    
EMILY GALLAGHER
Dolls were my favorite toy grow-
ing up. I would spend hours play-
ing with them, dressing them up, 
brushing their hair, and making up 
stories about them with my sisters 
in my bedroom. I played with my 
dolls longer than I would let peo-
ple know, for fear that I would be 
mocked. 
Because dolls have been such 
a natural part of my life, I have al-
ways been hesitant to accept the 
social stigma around them. I do un-
derstand and vehemently oppose 
the way that certain dolls have the 
potential to affect the way a child 
views his or her body. However, the 
way to combat these damaging ef-
fects is to draw a clear distinction 
between toys and role models.
Dolls have been accused of be-
ing creepy, patronizing and gender 
speci?c, as well as of in?icting un-
fair ideas of body image on young 
minds. Mattel’s Barbie doll is un-
doubtedly the biggest culprit in the 
argument that dolls give young girls 
a skewed perception of body image. 
For as long as Barbie dolls have ex-
isted they have made an ironic state-
ment about what the perfect female 
looks like, an impression that has 
deeply affected and altered the lives 
of many young girls.
Barbie dolls tell a girl that she 
must be tall and skinny, yet curva-
ceous in the right places. She must 
have a long neck, minuscule waist 
and wear a DD cup. Should the 
measurements of a Barbie doll be 
applied to a real human she would 
not have enough room for all of 
her organs: she would be unable to 
stand upright, lift her head, or use 
her hand to pick up anything heavi-
er than a pencil. This, says Mattel, is 
the perfect woman; a woman who, 
should she exist in the real world, 
would be crippled and deformed by 
her own contrived beauty.
The traditional blonde-haired, 
blue-eyed, pale-skinned Barbie has 
existed for generations. Society has 
gone back and forth admiring and 
mocking the doll, but the model has 
been the standard for the company 
for nearly a half-century. But this is 
all about to change.
Mattel recently released a state-
ment that Barbie dolls are now to 
be diversi?ed. Dolls bearing the 
descriptions “Petite,” “Tall,” and 
“Curvy” will now be ?lling the 
shelves along with dolls of a wider 
range of skin tones, eye and hair col-
ors, and “face sculpts.” Upon hear-
ing this news, one might be thrilled 
that after all this time Mattel is ?-
nally recognizing the absurdity of 
the “perfect woman” their company 
has worked so hard to create. But on 
second thought, what does it make 
a child think when his or her body 
can be classi?ed with a neat little 
label?
I suppose that I would be clas-
si?ed as petite. But what does that 
even mean? So I’m on the smaller 
end of things height and bust-wise; I 
may not have the curves or tall stat-
ure of my friends, but who cares? 
Why should what my body looks 
like de?ne me? Because of the way 
my body is made am I only allowed 
to play with dolls that most closely 
match my body description? 
I’ve never felt that I need to look 
just like my doll because I viewed my 
dolls as toys, not some model to as-
pire to. By diversifying in a box and 
classifying the range of dolls they 
manufacture, Mattel is encouraging 
this misconception that you should 
look like your toy. If you are tall, buy 
the “Tall” doll and strive to look like 
her. If you are “Curvy,” you better 
look like Mattel’s version of “Curvy.” 
Before, Barbie was an unattainable 
ideal with no relation to most girls’ 
realities, but the new claims about 
diversity make the unrealistic beau-
ty standards even more corrosive.
Everyone is different. Every per-
son has their own unique nuances 
to their body. By creating these new 
styles of dolls to “increase diver-
sity,” Mattel is doing nothing more 
than providing a few more options 
of cookie cutters to force a woman 
into. The source of the problem 
here is not with Mattel really, but 
the fact that society will allow a toy 
company to dictate what the per-
fect female body looks like. Barbie 
dolls are toys. That is always how 
I thought of them. Even at a young 
age I recognized the distinction be-
tween imagination and reality and 
I think most children would, too, if 
not for outside in?uences.
The true problem is that adults 
have not gotten it out of their heads 
that the perfect body is a Barbie 
doll. Look at any female model in a 
catalog and you will have con?rma-
tion of this. So perhaps it is wrong 
on some levels to crucify Mattel for 
creating misconceptions body im-
age, because the doll alone is not 
the biggest of the problems. The 
Barbie doll is a creation that is far 
from progressive in appearance, but 
the true problem lies in the fact that 
the grownups still can not ?gure out 
the difference between reality and 
playing pretend.

To some an Orwellian conspiracy, 
for others a necessary price for de-
mocracy, mass surveillance has been 
the center of numerous controver-
sies in the past couple of years. The 
person responsible for delivering the 
issue to the public agenda was Glenn 
Greenwald, an American lawyer 
and journalist. In cooperation with 
whistleblower Edward Snowden, 
Greenwald published the leaks that 
revealed how intelligence agencies 
such as the NSA were amassing huge 
sums of data on ordinary citizens. 
The Greenwald-Snowden stand-
point on the issue is clear: mass 
surveillance at this scale hinders 
the ability of a citizen to be a free 
individual and thus damages demo-
cratic ideals. Not everybody agrees, 
however.
When pro and anti mass surveil-
lance arguments are analyzed, it be-
comes clear that the disagreement 
boils down to a trust of governmental 
intentions. If the intentions of po-
litical power is to capture terrorists, 
violent criminals, and all other sorts 
of “bad guys,” and mass surveillance 
is just a means to achieve that end, 
the situation does look agreeable. 
After all, who doesn’t want to put 
bad guys in jail, right? However, if 
we believe the remote prospect that 
political power will work to main-
tain its own exercise of power, then 
mass surveillance becomes inher-
ently dangerous.
“I remember what the Inter-
net was like before it was being 
watched,” says Snowden, in Citi-
zenfour, the documentary telling 
the story behind the leaks. “And 
we’ve seen the chilling of that, the 
cooling of that and the changing 
of that model towards something 
which people self police their own 
views. And they literally make their 
own jokes on ending up on the list 
if they donate to a political cause 
or if they say something in a discus-
sion.” The list of people under sur-
veillance, by the way, is composed of 
an astonishing 1.2 million American 
citizens, as demonstrated by the re-
leased ?les. That is a lot of bad guys 
for a country of its size.
Benjamin Wittes, a senior fellow 
at The Brookings Institution, wrote a 
response to Greenwald which ended 
up becoming one of the most well-
cited arguments in favor of mass 
surveillance. 
The argument he sketches out in 
a post called Why Greenwald’s Chal-
lenge is Asking the Wrong Question 
on his blog, Lawfare, goes something 
like this: people should care about 
their privacy because the govern-
ment can use the data for malicious 
purposes. Wittes claims the govern-
ment clearly would not do that, so 
Greenwald must be wrong.
Wittes, contrary to Greenwald, 
clearly trusts his government. In 
his blog he says, “As readers of this 
site know, I do not hang out, intel-
lectually or emotionally, in the hu-
man rights clubhouse. I defend non-
criminal detention. I believe actively 
in robust surveillance authorities. I 
have no moral or legal qualms about 
military commissions. I don’t mind 
drone strikes. I’ll even — still — cop 
to harboring mixed feelings about 
coercive interrogations in the high-
est-stakes cases. #SorryNotSorry.” 
That is one way to look at it.
Without questioning which club-
house Wittes actually hangs out at, 
let us look at how Greenwald views 
terrorism. In a 2016 post on his blog, 
The Intercept, titled The Deceptive 
Debate Over What Causes Terrorism 
Against the West he says, “By point-
ing out the causal connection be-
tween U.S. violence and the decision 
to bring violence to the West, one is 
not denying that the attackers lack 
agency, nor is one claiming they are 
“forced” by the West to do this, nor 
is one “infantilizing” them. To rec-
ognize this causation is to do exactly 
the opposite: to point out that some 
human beings will decide — using 
their rational and reasoning facul-
ties and adult decision-making ca-
pabilities — that violence is justi?ed 
and even necessary against those 
who continually impose violence 
and aggression on others.” Green-
wald, apparently, does not share 
Wittes’ binary worldview where the 
only characters are freedom-loving, 
democratic Americans and violent 
terrorists. Quite to the contrary, 
Greenwald observes that terrorism 
is a multifaceted issue in which both 
sides are to blame.
With all this in mind, it turns out 
that the disagreement between Gre-
enwald and Wittes comes down to 
their views on terrorism, the very 
thing that mass surveillance is sup-
posed to address. To resolve this 
debate between national security 
and rights to privacy, then, we will 
need to ?gure out where we stand 
on terrorism. 
If we come to realize that terror-
ism is not a black and white issue, 
then there will have to be other mo-
tivations behind mass surveillance 
programs since there are no clear 
cut “bad guys” to be watching. And 
that, to me, is not a very pleasant 
thought.
Mass surveillance supporters oversimplify war on terror

Denver Broncos sti?e Carolina offense in Super Bowl 50
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
After months of games, the 
NFL season came down to a 
showdown between the Caro-
lina Panthers and the Denver 
Broncos. The two teams took 
very divergent paths to Super 
Bowl 50. Led by MVP-winning 
quarterback Cam Newton, the 
Panthers were dominant from 
the start, vanquishing all chal-
lengers until slipping up in a 
close game, receiving their 
only loss on the road against 
the Atlanta Falcons. The Pan-
thers put in a long string of 
dominant performances in-
cluding beat downs in the 
?rst half against both of their 
playoff opponents, the Seattle 
Seahawks and the Arizona 
Cardinals, to earn the Nation-
al Football Conference (NFC) 
Championship. The Bron-
cos, on the other hand, have 
stumbled and bumbled their 
way into what some consider 
to be the luckiest Super Bowl 
appearance in history on the 
backs of a defense that more 
closely resembles a swarm of 
300-pound killer bees than 
anything else. Denver’s sea-
son could easily have been de-
railed early in the year as they 
came very close to losing each 
of their ?rst games. Denver 
managed to rack up wins in 
all six however, and despite a 
prolonged absence from quar-
terback Peyton Manning, went 
on to split their remaining ten 
contests earning the top seed 
in a chaotic American Football 
Conference (AFC). After being 
out-gained and, arguably, out-
played by both the Pittsburgh 
Steelers and New England Pa-
triots along the way, the score-
board as the clock struck zero 
favored the Broncos and it all 
came together.
However, the small sam-
ple of a single football game 
makes for some unexpected 
results. The Broncos, who had 
managed only three wins by 
more than one score managed 
a fourth and took home a 24–
10 victory in Super Bowl 50. 
The preseason wisdom was 
that Carolina was doomed af-
ter former left tackle Jonathan 
Gross retired, and they would 
not be able to keep a clean 
pocket for Newton and the 
running game. That wisdom 
was wrong for 18 games, but 
when it mattered most, left 
tackle Michael Oher and crew 
were blindsided by a domi-
nant Broncos defensive line. 
Every time Newton had some 
time to breathe, the Panthers 
gained large chunks of yard-
age. Unfortunately for Caro-
lina, those moments were few 
and far between. Without any 
protection, Newton took lots 
of hits and was unable to get 
the Carolina offense going, 
dooming the Panthers’ Cin-
derella season.
Super Bowl 50 opened 
about as badly as it possibly 
could have for the Carolina 
Panthers. After giving up a 
?eld goal by Broncos kicker 
Brandon McManus on the 
opening drive, Panthers right 
tackle Mike Remmers badly 
missed a block on Broncos 
defensive lineman Von Miller. 
Broncos defensive end De-
Marcus Ware cut across the 
?eld to Miller’s side taking 
Panthers center Ryan Kalil, 
taking him out of the play. 
Since the Panthers offensive 
line was entirely occupied, 
Miller stormed almost unim-
peded into the back?eld and 
was able to knock the football 
from Newton’s hands. The ball 
bounced into the endzone 
and was recovered by Broncos 
linebacker Malik Jackson to 
put the Broncos up 10–0. The 
Panthers were able to respond 
with a 73-yard touchdown 
drive, but confusion about a 
fair catch call allowed Broncos 
return man Jordan Norwood 
to return a punt 61 yards, an 
NFL record. A ?eld goal fol-
lowed and the Broncos took a 
13–7 lead into halftime.
Both defenses shined in a 
vicious ?rst half. Miller was in 
Newton’s face all night, pres-
suring the star into many un-
characteristically bad throws 
and closing off Newton’s usual 
running lanes, preventing him 
from escaping Denver’s pass 
rush. In addition to Miller, 
Panthers linebacker Luke 
Kuechly showed off his speed 
and instincts, disrupting many 
Bronco plays. Kuechly’s patrol 
of the middle of the ?eld pre-
vented Manning from hitting 
his favorite short routes in 
front of the offensive line, and 
the Broncos were never able to 
mount much of a drive.
The second half seemed 
to open okay for the Panthers 
when they received the open-
ing kickoff and subsequently 
drove to the Broncos 27-yard 
line. However, after Miller 
was able to hang with Pan-
thers wide receiver Jericho 
Cotchery and break up a long 
pass, the Panthers were forced 
to kick a ?eld goal which Pan-
thers kicker Graham Gano 
clanked off the right post. 
The following Broncos drive 
turned into another McMa-
nus ?eld goal and the Broncos 
took a two–score lead. The 
Panthers managed another 
?eld goal, but they never 
threatened again and that was 
that.
After what was possibly 
his ?nal NFL game, Manning 
deserves credit for an incred-
ible career. Manning was ar-
guably the best quarterback 
in the NFL from his breakout 
sophomore season in 1999 un-
til a quadriceps injury marked 
the end of his career as an ef-
fective quarterback late last 
year. He fought back from a 
benching and a plantar fascia 
injury earlier in the season to 
lead his team to a Super Bowl 
victory in the perfect ending 
to what might be the greatest 
NFL quarterbacking career in 
history.
Manning’s night, however, 
was not his peak. This night 
belonged to Denver’s defense. 
Jackson showed off the combi-
nation of downhill speed and 
block–shedding strength that 
makes him one of the league’s 
more underrated players, 
Denver cornerback Aqib Talib 
— despite some discipline 
issues early in the season — 
showed why the Broncos paid 
him so much money to come 
and shore up the defense, and 
the Broncos rush-focused of-
fense did enough to outshine 
Carolina’s overwhelmed unit. 
However, the greatest con-
gratulations go to Miller, the 
Super Bowl MVP and deserv-
ingly so. Miller disrupted ev-
erything the Panthers tried 
and made it impossible for 
Carolina to strike back against 
any Denver advances.
In the end, Carolina’s of-
fensive line was unable to 
match up with the swarm-
ing front seven of the Denver 
Broncos and their failures 
stymied every offensive ef-
fort the Panthers tried to put 
together. It may put a damper 
on an incredible season for the 
Panthers, but with a newly 
cleared cap sheet and an in-
credible core of talent locked 
up for a long time, the Pan-
thers may be back on this stage 
soon enough. Super Bowl 50 
may have been the product of 
plenty of luck, but every Super 
Bowl win involves some good 
fortune. The Broncos deserve 
the chance to commemorate 
a roller coaster of the season 
at its highest peak with Super 
Bowl rings.

Men’s basketball rallies, beats Brandeis after losing lead
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
Coming off of a tough 
loss to New York University 
(NYU) to open the weekend, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team sought to 
serve up some vengeance on 
Sunday against the Brandeis 
University side a week after 
losing to the very same team. 
And they did, shaking off a 
slow start and eating up a big 
Brandeis lead to break out 
their 2nd conference win of 
the season.
A team that has been in 
the mix throughout the sea-
son, the Carnegie Mellon men 
have been looking for a spark 
in University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) play.  With a 
78–70 win over Brandeis, the 
men may have the spark they 
need.
Coming out in the ?rst 
half, the Tartan men showed 
a lot of energy, playing up on 
their toes, and jumping for ev-
ery sloppy Brandeis ball.  The 
team lept forward 8–4 with 
quick play up and down the 
court. But as the half dragged 
on, the team watched an 
early lead fall away as they 
sank into a hole against the 
Brandeis men. In a very early 
setback, junior forward Jack 
Serbin drew a technical foul 
from a hard drive towards 
the basket only a couple of 
minutes into the game. With 
the technical foul, Serbin, the 
Tartan’s leading rebounder 
this season, sat out the rest 
of the half, leaving the Tar-
tans to battle against Brandeis 
down a man. It didn’t take 
long to turn things around in 
the 2nd set though.
Even coming out of the 
half with a full lineup, play 
was slow and measured from the Carnegie Mellon side.  
The team looked out of step 
and unemotional compared 
to their opposition.  As the 
Tartans fell behind early in 
the 2nd half, they tried to 
re–energize their side by sub-
stituting in younger players 
who hadn’t seen much game 
time through the majority of 
the season.  The tactic didn’t 
give a lot of results through, 
and the team kept sliding go-
ing into the half.  The team 
looked frustrated.  Every time 
something looked like it was 
coming together, a foul call 
or a quick Brandeis response 
just made the hole bigger. 
That all changed when sopho-
more guard Ryan Maha got 
involved.
Down 31–40, Maha 
showed determination, rac-
ing down the court along the 
benches to make a jumper and 
start the team’s game–chang-
ing run.  With a couple more 
baskets tightening the game 
up, Maha broke loose to ?nish 
up what he started.  Seconds 
after a smooth mid–range 
jumper from the left side, 
Maha intercepted a Brandeis 
pass for a clean steal up the 
middle, which he ?nished 
with a layup at the rim for 
the ?rst Carnegie Mellon lead 
since the start of the game.
Building momentum off 
a few hard fought points by 
Maha early in the 2nd half, 
the men found a way to win 
from behind.  As Maha put 
it, the team “just had to chip 
away, tryin’ to get a basket in 
at a time, play solid, and keep 
playing [their] game”.  With 
the team down by nine points, 
Maha set off a 14 point unan-
swered scoring run by the Tar-
tans. They chunked together 
score after score, turning a de?cit into a lead.
The men didn’t stop there, 
looking patient and com-
mitted to ?nishing the job.  
They continued to battle 
the Brandeis side, keeping a 
tight defense, and holding off 
Brandeis’s efforts to ?nd clean 
shots.
Two technical fouls against 
Brandeis in the 2nd half cer-
tainly didn’t help the visitors, 
but with consistent ball con-
trol for the Tartans powered 
by Serbin’s seemingly uncon-
tested rebounds, there was no 
opportunity for Brandeis to 
get back into the game.
Brandeis had one last win-
dow of opportunity to tie the 
game, down 63–66, but Maha 
stole the ball right on the left 
sideline, charged for the bas-
ket, pulled up just inside the 
arc, and netted a long jumper 
to give the Tartans a perma-
nent ?ve point lead.
The entire second half was 
dominated by the Carnegie 
Mellon side, as the team out 
scored Brandeis 54–31 off 
of proli?c scoring by Maha, 
Serbin, and junior center 
Chris Shkil.  The trio com-
bined for 53 points, with 
Serbin and Shkil contributing 
11 and 9 rebounds respective-
ly to keep the ball in Carnegie 
Mellon’s hands.
After the game, Maha 
gushed about Shkil’s contri-
butions, with Shkil’s streams 
of layups and key jumpers 
sucking the air out of any 
potential Brandeis come-
back late in the game. “Chris 
Shkil played absolutely amaz-
ing. He played really well … 
Chris had a career night.  He 
played extremely, extremely 
well.”  Shkil led the Tartans in 
scoring with 24 points while 
shooting 58.8 percent.
In spite of a talented roster, 
the Tartan men struggled ear-
ly on in UAA play, going 1–7 in 
their ?rst conference games.  
But if the team continues their 
weekend success, they have a 
chance to turn things around 
in through the rest of confer-
ence play.
“I know we lost to 
[Brandeis] last Sunday by 
double digits, and we came 
back Sunday and we beat 
them ... So I think that that 
just proves that we can 
play with anybody”, Maha 
says of his team. Maha’s rec-
ognition of the teams capabil-
ity is showcased in their play.  
Taking the largest hole of the 
game and turning into their 
largest lead, the Tartans dem-
onstrated their ability to com-
pete at a high level.
Friday night, the Tartans 
suffered a tight loss to NYU 
70–67, losing their own half 
time lead to the visitor’s run.  The team came out shoot-
ing, putting 43 points in the 
?rst half while shooting 52.9 
percent, but NYU came back 
to defeat them. With the 
Brandeis win, Carnegie Mel-
lon ended the weekend 1–1. The team’s next game will 
be this Friday at Chicago, and 
the  Tartan’s next home game 
will be the following Friday, 
February 19th against Emory 
University.
Tartan tennis squads start dominating top opponents
Women’s basketball opens strong, gets a win at home

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team faced off against 
NCAA Division II opponent 
Walsh University on Saturday, 
and topped the Cavaliers 6–3 
in a convincing performance 
to improve their record to 3–1.
The match began with 
doubles play, and the Tartans 
swept their way through the 
rounds. The dynamic duo of 
senior Abhishek Alla and ju-
nior Kiril Kirkov set the pace 
of the match by dominating 
their way to an 8–1 win in 
third doubles. They set the 
tone of the match and made 
sure Walsh knew that the Tar-
tans came to play. The second 
point came in ?rst doubles, as 
senior Yuvraj Kumar and ?rst–
year Daniel Levine emerged 
victorious 8–3 in their set. At 
this point, it was becoming 
evident that Carnegie Mellon 
had more experienced play-
ers, but Walsh did not give up. 
The Cavaliers gave the Tar-
tans a real run for their mon-
ey in second doubles, but the 
tandem of sophomore Jeffrey 
Chen and junior Kenny Zheng 
pulled through once more 
for Carnegie Mellon, win-
ning their set 9–8 and clos-
ing out the doubles matches. 
Every Carnegie Mellon pair 
emerged victorious, and the 
Cavaliers went into singles 
play with their backs against 
the wall.
In singles, Carnegie Mellon 
continued to show competi-
tive prowess, but Walsh man-
aged to pick up the pace. The 
Tartans’ fourth point came 
after a straight set victory by 
?rst-year Vayum Arora, win-
ning by scores of 6–2, 6–2 in 
fourth singles. Although ?rst–
year Chaz Downing dropped 
matches in ?rst and second 
singles, he came back with a 
vengeance and clinched the 
win in fourth singles with a 
6–0, 6–2 win. Sophomore 
Tommy Cheng also picked up 
a straight set victory in sixth 
singles to ?nish the scoring 
for the Tartans, winning 6–3, 
6–2.
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team hits the 
court again on Saturday, Feb. 
13 as they host Division I op-
ponent St. Francis University 
at 3 p.m.
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis team took the court 
on Saturday to compete with 
Division II opponents Califor-
nia University of Pennsylvania 
and Slippery Rock University. 
The Tartans stepped onto the 
court looking to defend their 
No. 6 overall rank in Division 
III. Carnegie Mellon started 
the day by defeating the 14th–
ranked Vulcans 6–2, and end-
ed the day by dominating The 
Rock 8–1.
Doubles play saw Carnegie 
Mellon take a 2–0 lead against 
the Vulcans, winning in sec-
ond and third doubles. In the 
second slot, sophomores Cori 
Sidell and Katie Lai played 
their way to a 9–7 victory, 
while the duo of senior Abbey 
Hamstra and junior Nicholle 
Torres also won 9–7 in third 
doubles. Even though the Tar-
tans dropped ?rst doubles, 
the maintained their con?-
dence going into singles and 
transitioned smoothly into 
more victories.
Torres went on to win third 
singles by a score of 6–1, 6–1, 
putting the Tartans up 3–1. 
First-year Jamie Vizelman 
was the next to earn a point 
for Carnegie Mellon, winning 
fourth singles with a score of 
6–2, 6–4. Senior Brooke Tsu 
clinched ?rst singles 4–6, 7–5, 
6–1. The Tartans ?nished off 
the Vulcans with a score of 
6–2, setting them up for an 
impressive nightcap victory 
against The Rock.
Against Slippery Rock, 
the Tartans saw themselves 
holding a 3–0 advantage af-
ter doubles play, and never 
looked back. Tsu and Vizel-
man dominated second dou-
bles, winning 8–0 before the 
duo of Hamstra and Torres 
picked up another doubles 
victory, 8–3 in third doubles. 
Sidell and ?rst-year Minami 
Makino then won 8–5 in 
?rst doubles to ?nish up the 
sweep. The Tartans had a 
comfortable lead going into 
singles against The Rock, and 
they did not let up.
Vizelman managed her 
second singles win of the day 
at fourth singles, with a 6–1, 
6–1 victory just before Torres 
clinched the team win with a 
6–2, 6–3 score at third singles. 
First-year Charlotte Diess won 
at sixth singles with a score of 
6–4, 6–1, just after Lai won in 
?fth singles 6–3, 6–2. The ?-
nal Tartan victory of the day 
came from Sidell at second 
singles when she won 6–3, 
6–4. With a ?nal scoreline of 
8–1, Carnegie Mellon’s domi-
nating performance ended 
their night on a high note, 
and will surely send them 
into their next match with 
con?dence.
The Tartans women’s ten-
nis team will be back on the 
court on Saturday, Feb. 13 as 
they host Division I opponent 
St. Francis University at 3 p.m.
The Carnegie Mellon ten-
nis teams have been dominat-
ing opponents in higher divi-
sions, and this is a good sign 
for both teams that they can 
play at the highest level. Their 
next challenge will only test 
them further, and the Tartan 
tennis teams have to recog-
nize the level of play of their 
oppnents and rise up to them.
So far, the Tartans have met 
every challenge with con?-
dence and prowess, and they 
do not seem to be backing 
down. Ultimately, the Tartan 
tennis teams will use the mo-
tivation earned from these 
victories to propel themselves 
to national competition; a 
place they know they belong.

On Friday, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s basketball 
team faced off against sev-
enth-ranked New York Uni-
versity for the second time in 
seven days. Hoping to make it 
past their 75–74 loss the pre-
vious week in New York, the 
Tartans won this game 70–57. 
The Tartans improved to 15–4 
overall and 4–4 in the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
(UAA).
At the start of the game, 
the Tartans struck ?rst after 
a missed shot by the Violets. 
NYU tried to quickly respond, 
but the Tartans played tight 
defense against the Vio-
lets, limiting the number of 
chances NYU was able to at-
tempt from the ?eld. The Vio-
lets played full court defense 
against the Tartans, limiting 
the amount of points the Tar-
tans could get. The end of the 
quarter saw the Violets start 
to get the better of the Tartan 
defense, taking a 14–12 lead 
with around one minute to go 
in the quarter. Though junior 
guard Jackie Hudepohl made 
a basket to tie up the game 
again, the Violets scored as 
time expired, taking a 16–14 
lead.
In the second quarter, the 
Violets built up a 26–16 lead 
before the Tartans regained 
momentum. After making 
their ?rst three–pointer of the 
night and a few fouls, the Tar-
tans brought it back to a man-
ageable 26–24 de?cit. The 
Violets tried to keep the Tar-
tans back, but senior guard 
Lindsay Poss managed to tie 
up the game before a ques-
tionable foul called against 
the Tartans gave NYU a free 
throw attempt. The Tartans 
responded and retook the lead 
at 31–27 before the Violets 
called timeout to try and halt 
Carnegie Mellon’s 15–1 run. 
After a foul called at 0.7 sec-
onds left, sophomore guard 
Anna Novak quickly grabbed 
the ball from ?rst-year guard 
Jenn Mayberger and made a 
shot to take a 35–29 lead into 
halftime.
Hudepohl opened up the 
third quarter by scoring twice, 
once on her own and once off 
of a rebound. Though NYU 
brought the game to within 
six points, the Tartans kept 
the Violets from coming back 
any closer during the quar-
ter, building up the score to 
50–39. In the ?nal quarter, 
the Tartans’ lead grew as big 
as 60–46. NYU’s attempts to 
come back were matched by 
Tartan scoring. Though NYU 
kept trying to ?ght back, the 
Tartan defense held their 
scoring in check, ensuring 
victory long before the ?nal 
buzzer.
After starting the season 
13–0, the Tartans entered a 
four game losing streak before 
beating Brandeis University 
on Sunday, Jan. 31. Though 
the team suffered a setback 
as UAA matches began, it has 
managed to stay focused on 
the big picture. No game was 
ever completely out of reach 
for the Tartans, and the team 
seems to be ?nding its stride 
once again.
Junior center and for-
ward Lisa Murphy once again 
played a key role for the Tar-
tans. Despite times when 
she would be double or even 
triple covered, she still man-
aged to ?nd the basket. She 
shot 8-for-8 from the ?oor, 
earned 16 points, and got 14 
rebounds, etching her 11th 
double-double of the season.
Hudepohl led all scorers 
with 22 points, and she also 
got 11 rebounds for her third 
double-double of the season. 
Poss scored 16, marking the 
third straight game she has 
scored at least 15 points. May-
berger made nine assists, and 
she is only eight away from 
breaking the school’s single 
season record.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
faced off against Brandeis in 
a rematch from the previous 
week’s 66–60 win, and fell to 
the Judges 72–66.The Tartans 
will next travel to the Univer-
sity of Chicago for a rematch 
on Friday, Feb. 12.

EOC changes to address crowds, cater to younger students  
CLAIRE GIANAKAS
Editor-in-Chief
The Employment Oppor-
tunities Conference (EOC), a 
job fair hosted by the Career 
and Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) each semester 
at Carnegie Mellon University, 
is an essential step in the job 
search process for most stu-
dents on campus. 
This year’s spring EOC, 
which will be held in the Co-
hon Center in Wiegand Gym-
nasium on Tuesday Feb. 9 and 
Wednesday Feb. 10 from 10 
a.m. to 5 p.m., will include two 
notable changes — the day will 
be split between internship and 
full-time opportunities, which 
was successfully implemented 
in the fall. First and second-
year students will be able to 
attend JumpStart, a program 
intended to promote connec-
tions between recruiters and 
younger students. 
The ?rst of these changes, 
splitting the EOC into two ses-
sions, is meant to aid both stu-
dents and employers by mak-
ing the event more ef?cient, 
even with such a large number 
of students and employers at-
tending. 
The ?rst session, focusing 
on internship opportunities, 
will run from 10 a.m. to 12:45 
p.m., while the second session, 
focusing on full-time opportu-
nities, will be from 2 p.m. to 
4:45 p.m. If students have class 
con?icts during these times, 
they are allowed to attend ei-
ther session. 
“The EOC is a very popular 
event, and we wanted to limit 
overcrowding by creating two 
sessions. We did this in the fall 
as well, and it improved traf?c 
?ow,” said Judith Mancuso, the 
assistant director for recruiting 
at the CPDC. 
Mancuso also noted that 
this structure will bene?t 
both students and employ-
ers in more ways than just 
crowd management. “Students 
bene?t from less crowding 
and having employers who 
are prepared to talk about 
what they are coming to the 
EOC seeking,” Mancuso said. 
“Employers also appreciate 
this because it allows them to 
have representatives on hand 
who can speak to a particular 
audience.”
The second major change 
from previous years is the 
new JumpStart program, 
which aims to bene?t younger 
students. Through this pro-
gram, ?rst and second year 
students will be able to attend 
an event in Rangos Ballroom 
on Feb. 8, the evening before 
the EOC, from 5 to 7:30 p.m. 
The event will be a networking 
and internship fair designed 
speci?cally for ?rst and sec-
ond years. Students may reg-
ister for the event in advance 
on TartanTRAK, although 
preregistration is not required. 
Mancuso identi?ed sev-
eral bene?ts that they hope 
will come from the JumpStart 
program, including increased 
interaction between recruiters 
and young talent. 
“Jumpstart will provide a 
more relaxed environment for 
students who are attending a 
career event for the ?rst time,” 
Mancuso said. “We wanted to 
provide an event for ?rst and 
second year students, who 
may have never attended a ca-
reer event, to begin interacting 
with employers and … to give 
employers an opportunity to 
engage with students earlier in 
their academic careers.”
Mancuso also noted that the 
JumpStart program will allow 
students and employers foster 
relationships for the future. 
“JumpStart will help em-
ployers brand their organiza-
tions and identify and build fu-
ture talent pipelines,” Mancuso 
said. “It will also help students 
learn about employers, intern-
ship programs, and desired 
professional skill sets.”
As always, the CPDC has 
a variety of resources to help 
students prepare for the EOC. 
CPDC drop-in hours are Mon-
day through Friday from 11:30 
a.m. to 1:30 p.m. Drop-in 
hours allow students to meet 
for 15 minutes with a career 
counselor in the CPDC Advis-

ond ?oor of West Wing. 
The CPDC is also holding a 
résumé blitz in the CPDC Ad-
vising Center on Feb. 8 from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. This pro-
gram allows students to meet 
with a career counselor for 15 
minutes to review a hard copy 
of their résumé or to practice 
their elevator pitch. 
No appointment is neces-
sary for either event. The CPDC 
YouTube channel also has two 
short videos to help prepare 
students for the fair. 
“JumpStart will provide a more 
relaxed environment for students. 
We wanted to provide an event for 
... students, who may have never 
attended a career event.”

Make the most of your EOC visit this week with these tips 
BRADEN KELNER
Special to The Tartan
University career fairs can 
sometimes seem like mad-
houses, with hundreds of 
employers visiting each day 
and an even greater number 
of students passing through. 
Nevertheless, it’s important to 
remain collected and profes-
sional when presenting your-
self to the people who, hope-
fully, will soon be hiring you 
for a full-time position or sum-
mer internship. Here are ?ve 
things you should be sure to 
bring to the Employment Op-
portunities Conference (EOC) 
to make sure you strike the 
perfect ?rst impression.
The right attire
Looking like you know 
what you’re doing is half the 
battle at a career fair. To make 
your attire re?ect the con?-
dence employers want to see 
in candidates, stick to a formal 
dress code. For men, wear a 
business suit with a solid shirt 
or one that has a clean pattern. 
Tuck in your shirt, and wear a 
belt even if you don’t need 
one. Don’t forget a tie and a 
pair of black or brown shoes to 
?nish off your look.
For women, wear a suit or 
a skirt with a suit jacket. Stick 
to neutral colors like black 
or gray, and wear heels to 
complement the out?t. Both 
men and women should take 
the time to iron out wrinkles 
in your pants and shirt and 
to brush off any smudges that 
may be lingering on your jack-
et. As for hygiene, make sure 
your hair is cleaned up — cut 
and combed — and you look 
as if you got more than your 
fair share of sleep the night be-
fore, even if you haven’t.
Lists of companies to visit
Before attending the fair, 
visit the Career and Profes-
sional Development Center’s 
career fair webpages to view 
the companies coming to cam-
pus. Research companies that 
interest you and make a list of 
the ones that seem to be good 
?ts. 
For the companies you’re 
head over heels for, consider 
spicing up your résumé and 
making unique copies, rather 
than a general résumé, to fo-
cus on the qualities you know 
those companies are looking 
for. 
Hand your general résumé 
out to the companies you’re 
less interested in, but would 
still be happy to work for. By 
researching companies be-
forehand, you’re sure to make 
a better impression with re-
cruiters. Knowing a company’s 
work and how you can spe-
ci?cally help the company will 
de?nitely make you stand out 
from the rest of the pack.
A portfolio for résumés
Have a handful of résumés, 
but don’t know what to do 
with them? Take a trip to the 
University Bookstore to pick 
up a portfolio. These ?rm fold-
ers for your papers will round 
out your professional look.
Not only do they look sleek, 
but they also ensure that you 
won’t suffer any résumé sna-
fus, like dropping all your pa-
pers or accidentally handing a 
recruiter a unique résumé in-
tended for another company. 
These handy folders allow 
you to organize your résumés, 
and a list of references and 
samples of your work if your 
?eld typically requires those 
elements.
Portfolios are easy to tuck 
under your arm and walk 
with, and they also add to your 
air of professionalism while 
giving you something to do 
with your hands.
A water bottle and food
Career fairs can become 
packed and hectic. To give 
yourself some relief in your 
multiple layers of clothing, 
bring a water bottle. Take a 
drink of cool water if you’re 
feeling hot or overwhelmed. 
Staying hydrated will ensure 
that you are focused before 
you visit the companies that 
potentially hold your dream 
jobs. 
Before the fair, also make 
sure to eat. Sometimes, you 
may ?nd yourself waiting 
in unexpectedly long lines, 
which could cut into time al-
lotted for lunch after the fair. 
Even if the fair isn’t crowded, 
it’s always better to be over- 
rather than underprepared.
The right attitude
Remember that you’re at 
the career fair to land a job or 
internship. Act that way. Ap-
proach all recruiters as if you 
want nothing more than to 
work for their company. Greet 
them enthusiastically and 
shake their hand ?rmly.
Show them what quali-
?es you for a position at their 
company through an already 
prepared speech, but be sure 
to be ?exible in what you’ve 
prepared if the recruiter has 
other plans for your conversa-
tion. Be ready to answer some 
tough questions, and don’t 
break a sweat if you’re not able 
to adequately answer one. An-
swer it to the best of your abil-
ity and get ready for the next 
question. 
Ask the recruiter some 
questions yourself to show 
your interest and ensure that 
a position at the business is 
something you truly want to 
pursue. Thank the recruiter at 
the end of your conversation 
and follow up with an email 
after.

It’s never too early to search for your dream job at the EOC
NIVEDITA CHOPRA
Special to the Tartan
If you walk into the Uni-
versity Center Tuesday and 
Wednesday while taking the 
warmer route to class, you 
may feel out of place amongst 
an exceptionally well-dressed 
crowd, the likes of which are 
rarely seen on campus out-
side of the Tepper School of 
Business. 
It’s that time of year again: 
various companies are here 
this week for the Spring Em-
ployment Opportunities Con-
ference (EOC), the semester’s 
largest career fair that will 
take place in the Wiegand 
Gymnasium in the Jared L. 
Cohon University Center from 
10 a.m.–4:45 p.m.
If you’re a ?rst-year or 
sophomore, chances are that 
you’re not going. Perhaps you 
intended to go, but are now 
having second thoughts given 
the number of jobs that go to 
upperclass students. On the 
other hand, you may be going, 
but mainly for the swag — free 
stuff, for the uninitiated. Here 
are some better reasons to go to 
the EOC as an underclassman.
Nothing to lose
Take a moment to sit back 
and think about your dream 
job. I bet there will be at least 
one company at the EOC 
where you can get that job, or 
do something related that’s 
equally exciting. This semes-
ter’s EOC is one of the few 
events at which you’ll have 
absolutely nothing to lose 
by talking to recruiters. Your 
passion may even impress 
them enough to land you that 
dream summer job! You’ll nev-
er know if you don’t take the 
plunge.
Prep for future fairs
If you’re ?rmly convinced 
that there’s no way that the 
company of your choice will 
hire a freshman or sophomore, 
here’s a more practical reason 
to go to the EOC. 
Going to the EOC this year 
is good preparation for your 
following years at Carnegie 
Mellon. Attending this semes-
ter will allow you to feel what 
it’s like, so that you know what 
to expect as an upperclass 
student.
Simply walk up to the com-
pany that you’re eyeing for 
a job in the future, and chat 
with the recruiter. Ask about 
the company’s required quali-
?cations and interview pro-
cess, so that you know what 
they’re looking for and can be 
better prepared for the follow-
ing year, when you’re in the 
running for a job.
Small booths are hiring
While you’re at it, check 
out some of the smaller booths 
that none of the upperclass-
men are going to. Chatting 
with the recruiters there is less 
stressful — sometimes even 
fun — and can de?nitely boost 
your con?dence.
And remember, they’re hir-
ing too. So if they offer any op-
portunities you’re interested 
in, go for it! The odds of geting 
that job are substantially high-
er and the company probably 
pays more than traditional 
summer employers.
So, hunt out your nicest for-
mal clothes and be prepared to 
join the crowd of well-dressed 
students at the EOC. 
Draft a quick résumé — or 
update an existing one you 
have — and print out a few 
dozen copies. Make a name 
tag, dress nicely, and get ready 
to go.

Tales from abroad: going to Madrid, Spain 
Amelia Britton writes about her experiences with Spanish people, culture, food, & history
I’ve been in Spain nearly a month now, and it still doesn’t 
feel like I’m staying. The orientation period is over, and I 
hope having a routine will make me feel less like a visitor.
This semester abroad marks part three of my year away 
from Carnegie Mellon’s Pittsburgh campus, during 
which I’ve lived in a new city every four months. I left 
Pittsburgh in May 2015, went home to Ohio to pack and 
recharge, and headed to southern Virginia for a surreal 
internship experience with NASA. I lived with other 
interns in a crooked little beach house — our kitchen 
floor was so slanted that if you dropped something, it 
rolled to the corner. It felt like a dream. I met wonderfully 
nerdy people who were excited to talk about their 
wonderfully nerdy work. In August, I went home again to 
unpack and repack before heading for Washington, D.C. 
I’m glad I did the Washington Semester Program, but it 
was difficult. I worked as an intern three days a week 
and took four classes, so I always felt like I was doing 
one-too-many things. The city was smart, put-together, 
and fast-paced. It was exhausting. At winter break, I was 
glad for the chance to hibernate before my next journey: 
Madrid.
I studied Spanish in high school with a Madrileñan 
teacher. I picked up his accent — the distinct “th” for 
soft “c” and “z” sounds — and I decided to study abroad 
in the one place I could actually use it. Of course, Madrid 
also has the allure of being a European capital, and the 
history and culture here are astounding. Unfortunately, I 
still sound more like an American than a Spaniard.
Speaking Spanish here is a very humbling experience. 
I have passable classroom Spanish, and I am able to 
understand others more easily than I can produce the 
words myself. My host family is patient and helpful, 
but communicating with locals is often an exercise in 
embarrassing myself. I can get around the city and find 
the things I want, but I sometimes misunderstand small 
interactions. I’ve also misread situations for using the 
formal “usted” and informal “tú” (a young police officer 
corrected me — I had used “usted” because he was in 
a position of authority, but he was a little offended to be 
considered old).
While I can feel my Spanish getting better, I also feel 
reduced to less complex emotions or ideas. I can’t 
express nuance very well, so I worry that I seem boring. 
I know I don’t come across as intelligent — being smart 
is different than being good at Spanish. I’m frustrated 
by my own inability to share stories or give details. 
It’s strange to see what’s left of my personality when 
communication becomes so limited.
I won’t pretend to be an expert on Madrid or Spanish 
culture, but I’ll share some observations:
I’m still getting used to the daily schedule here. 
Spaniards make a late lunch their main meal of the day 
(usually around 2 p.m.). The meals are much more spread 
out — a tiny breakfast (toast and coffee) at 8 a.m. and 
a small-ish dinner at 9 p.m. — so I spend a lot of time 
feeling hungry even though I’m not really eating less. 
The food is delicious; lots of potatoes, ham, and seafood. I 
haven’t had a bad meal.
The Euro has some peculiarities; each bill is a different 
size (actually very important for people who are blind — 
U.S. currency is among a few in the world in which every 
bill is identical). One and two Euros are represented by 
coins, so I find that the change rattling around in the 
bottom of my purse is suddenly useful and valuable. A 
change purse is becoming a necessity.
While some buildings here are much older than the 
United States, it’s not uncommon to see old farmhouses 
or sheds in the countryside that are falling to ruins. In 
both the country and the city, graffiti is ubiquitous. 
Instead of removing the graffiti, Spanish authorities seem 
to let it be. There’s an understanding that more would 
only take its place.
A few buildings seem deceptively old. For instance, I 
thought it was interesting to see an old-looking archway 
beside a very modern, metallic observation tower. I later 
learned that the archway was built to commemorate a 
Civil War victory for Franco’s troops, and is only 50 or so 
years older than its fellow. I felt a little cheated.
As a whole, Spain seems more relaxed than the U.S. It’s 
certainly more relaxed than a place like D.C. I’m also 
looking forward to exploring more of Europe; Spain is the 
only place I’ve been overseas. Traveling within Spain 
has been amazing already — the Roman aqueducts of 
Segovia and the incredible walled city of Ávila make me 
conscious of just how young the United States is. As 
a capital city, Madrid is modern and busy, and yet the 
evidence of its Roman-to-Muslim-to-Catholic imperial 
history is all around.
My time here is passing quickly. I want to balance travel 
with getting to know Madrid. Of all the new places I’ve 
lived in the last year, this is the most drastic change. I’ll 
be ready for something familiar next fall, but I’m trying to 
make the most of the next few months.

Cloud Tectonics is the ?rst play I’ve ever seen in the 
Helen Wayne Rauh Studio Theater. When I walked in 
it reminded me of this place called York Little Theatre, 
two blocks away from my house growing up. My 
grandparents always took my sister and me to see 
plays, but the most memorable ones weren’t always on 
the main stage. There’s a certain intimacy to the studio 
performances that lends itself really well to certain 
productions. Just walking into the theater in Purnell on 
Thursday night and looking at the set, I could tell this 
would be one of those plays.
This isn’t a play you can easily describe in passing with 
one to two sentences, nor can you just page through 
the program to get the gist. It took me nearly half of the 
play to ?gure out exactly what it was about — although 
I can tell you that two major themes are time and sex, 
obsessions many students in the audience could likely 
relate to.
The set was simply a home on a hardwood square, 
except it dissolved into ?oating planks as it moved 
toward the risers. The play is primarily about characters 
Celestina del Sol and Aníbal de la Luna, played by 
junior drama students Isabel Pask and Clayton Barry 
respectively. Celestina is a pregnant woman who’s 
been on a cross-country road trip with a truck driver 
trying to ?nd Rodrigo Cruz, her baby’s father. She got 
off the truck when the truck driver tried to touch her 
knees. Aníbal ?nds her hitchhiking in the middle of 
the “storm of the century” on his drive home from work 
at LAX. He offers for her to spend the evening at his 
house after they both promise not to be axe murderers.
As soon as Celestina walks into the house on the stage, 
the digital clock on the table next to the couch goes 
blank. She tells Aníbal stories about her life in Montauk, 
where she lived her whole life in her bedroom, reading 
crime novels and thinking about sex. She’s also 
apparently 54 years old and has been pregnant for two 
years. She only learned about minutes and hours and 
weeks and years from the truck driver because she has 
no conception of time. As they spend time together 
they fall in love.
Later on there are two interruptions from Aníbal’s 
brother Nelon, home after six years of military service. 
While in real-time these appearances feel 20 minutes 
apart, they are actually two years apart in the play’s 
timeline. Throughout the course of this intimate night 
where a moment is a month, Aníbal and Celestina 
perfectly deliver monologues about their sexual and 
romantic histories. Silence and speech bear equal 
weight, and there is an incredible erotic tension.
But once they come back to reality, all hell almost 
literally breaks loose. She runs away and has her baby, 
but a massive storm destroys Los Angeles in one night.
We come back in a newly reborn Los Angeles, the 
capital of the United States, home of the White House. 
Celestina takes her infant to visit an elderly Aníbal. 
He doesn’t quite seem to remember or believe that it’s 
really her, but he tells the story of the night he spent 
with the woman who doesn’t belong in this world. 
The play ends with the re-performance of a speech 
Celestina made earlier in the play to Aníbal, who had 
forgotten how to speak Spanish. Elderly Aníbal recites 
the Spanish while she translates into English her 
musings of what it would have been like to love him 
at every age — as an infant, as an old man, and all in 
between. As an ending, this really captivated me. I left 
the theater having so many feelings about the way time 
and love are so connected.
As emotional as I was, I had a really hard time 
explaining why, and even what exactly happened. 
But then I went back and read through the program. 
Dramaturg Lina Pulgarin-Duque compiled ?ve pages 
of background into playwright José Rivera’s af?nity for 
magical realism, and how similar it is to the scienti?c 
method. An author formulates a question: what would 
reality be like if a woman could exist outside of time? 
And then in writing a story, they test their hypothesis 
and try to make that fantastic reality seem plausible. 
She gives the example of a theory Aníbal has that 
“[Love] alters the physics around you in some way: 
changing the speed of light and the shape of space 
and how you experience time.” A magical concept, 
but actually grounded in Einstein’s theory of general 
relativity.
The play was so beautifully acted, directed, produced, 
and lit, but I think it was really smart for the production 
team to acknowledge that this play is challenging 
to understand on its own. They did the necessary 
research for the average theater-goer. I was very 
thankful that they provided a really approachable 
thematic summary in order to help us contextualize the 
beautiful storm that was Cloud Tectonics: the merging 
of the sky, sun, moon, and ground.

Artist pro?le: Stephen Wu
SWU opens up to The Tartan about his upcoming debut EP 
When anyone thinks of Carnegie Mellon’s School of 
Computer Science, they probably think that it produces 
some of the best thinkers in the world, but thinkers who 
can only use the left side of their brains. Stephen Wu, 
a junior Computer Science major who produces under 
the name SWU, is one of the many students who prove 
that age-old dichotomy incorrect. A San Francisco 
native, he said he hopes to “bring the sunshine [to 
Pittsburgh] with my music.” SWU’s debut six-song 
EP Human is slated to be released later this month on 
purchase platforms iTunes and Amazon Music as well 
as streaming platforms Spotify and Soundcloud. SWU’s 
sound is a mix of EDM characterized by deep bass 
accented by bright synths mixed with melodic vocals, 
and it’s sure to resonate with the burgeoning dance 
music following here at Carnegie Mellon.
Human’s six-song structure showcases the spectrum of 
SWU’s sound and outlook, according to Wu. “My EP … 
consists of two hard songs and three softer songs, with 
the last one as a mix. It shows the part of my personality 
that’s very intense, but also my happy side. Life isn’t all 
dark and gloomy, and it’s good to be reminded of that, 
especially when you’re studying in your room.”
Mathematical concepts and music may seem like 
separate concepts at surface level, but they’re actually 
quite interrelated, especially with electronic music 
production. To create sound, Wu used the programming 
language Nyquist to take a regular wave and alter it, 
making the structure more jagged. The result is a dirtier 
synthesizer bite, which is the driving force underneath 
his layered sound — just in case you weren’t aware that 
the biggest EDM titans are also the biggest nerds.
Wu ?rst fell in love with music at a young age thanks to 
the in?uence of his older sister. What began as a happy 
distraction formed into a passion, as he began to think 
critically about music and what exactly separated good 
songs from bad ones. Before long he was making tracks 
using LogicPro on his laptop and sharing them with 
family and friends.
SWU’s debut was produced and recorded almost 
entirely on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. Wu would begin 
working on a song in his dorm room once inspiration 
struck and then take it to the College of Fine Arts 
recording studio to produce a ?nished version. Riccardo 
Schulz, an associate professor in the School of Music 
and president of Pittsburgh Digital Recording & 
Editing Company, assisted Wu with much of the studio 
recording process.
When he’s not programming or making music, Wu 
relaxes by playing tennis. He hopes to one day possibly 
make music his career, “if it works out”, but his 
ambition and talent will surely make him successful in 
whatever path he chooses.
SWU’s debut EP, Human, will be available on Spotify, 
Soundcloud, iTunes, Amazon Music, and Shazam later 
this month.

Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences 
Diversi?es Its Membership
#OscarsSoWhite took the news by storm in the weeks 
following the nominations for the 88th Academy 
Awards. The smoke has slightly cleared since, but, 
in the shadow of such focus, the Academy of Motion 
Picture Arts and Sciences took swift action to shine 
a light on the problem. In a unanimous vote, the 
Academy’s Board of Governors changed the way 
members are selected in an effort to diversify its voting 
block. The Academy stated in a press release:
“Beginning later this year, each new member’s voting 
status will last 10 years, and will be renewed if that 
new member has been active in motion pictures 
during that decade. In addition, members will receive 
lifetime voting rights after three ten-year terms; or if 
they have won or been nominated for an Academy 
Award.” Additionally, the Academy added three new 
seats on its Board of Governors, to be nominated by 
the President and con?rmed by the Board, and updated 
its recruitment efforts across the globe to ?nd new, 
quali?ed, diverse, people to add to its membership.
In subsequent material, the Academy clari?ed some 
of the release’s more vague points. How does the 
Academy de?ne “active in motion pictures?” This 
question was answered with the statement,“You must 
be employed in the same kinds of quality ?lms that got 
you into the Academy in the ?rst place. Your status will 
be assessed by your peers in your branch — the people 
who best understand the intricacies of the motion 
picture industry and your ?eld.” The material explains 
that screen credit is not required for membership and 
work does not have to be restricted to one ?eld (i.e. an 
actor could sell a script or an editor can direct, and is 
all considered “activity” in the movie business, thus 
qualifying for membership).
This is a step in the right direction for the Academy. 
Though I do not anticipate it solving the larger issue 
of diversity absence in Hollywood, I see this as an 
ambitious step forward by an organization that prides 
itself on tradition.
The 88th Academy Awards, hosted by Chris Rock, will 
air on Feb. 28 on ABC.
Adam McKay On Ant-Man Sequel and Solo Wasp 
Film
Writer/Director Adam McKay is on a hot streak coming 
out of 2015. The Big Short is nominated for Best 
Picture, McKay is nominated for Best Director, and his 
co-written screenplay for Ant-Man was surprisingly 
well received. With the announcement of a sequel, 
Ant-Man and the Wasp, McKay sat down with IGN to 
discuss the upcoming ?lm.
“…I’ve been talking to Peyton Reed and to [Paul] Rudd, 
but you know Marvel has a process that they do, so 
they may have other writers working on a script — the 
only thing I tell ‘em is ‘If you need me, I’m here.’ I love 
working on those — it’s really fun. It was also very fun 
just writing. And fortunately we had a great director 
in Peyton Reed, so we wrote all this crazy stuff and 
then he did it really well. I was like ‘I could get used to 
this!’ It’s certainly a lot easier — I just showed up at the 
premiere and was like ‘Good job!,” McKay said.
The Wasp was teased at the conclusion of Ant-Man and 
Marvel has been integrating new characters into their 
universe with Vision, Black Panther and Doctor Strange 
up ?rst. It only makes sense to ask about a Wasp 
standalone ?lm in Marvel’s future.
“Possibly. I think it all depends on this sequel and how 
the character plays. Certainly there’s a lot of female 
superheroes in the Marvel universe, so I’m sure you’re 
going to see them start to spread out. They sort of 
started with their kind of bedrock characters from 
the 60s and the 70s and I think you saw more of an 
explosion of female characters happening in the 80s 
and then the 90s. X-Men obviously has great female 
characters, but that’d be interesting, a Wasp movie… 
I always think of the two of them as kind of together — 
they always were in the comics — but why not? Sure.,” 
McKay said.
McKay seems either out of the loop or hysterically 
elusive about the future plans for the characters. If I had 
to put money on it, I’d say a standalone Wasp ?lm is 
on the “Maybe” list at Marvel. McKay is exactly right; 
if the character pops up in Ant-Man and the Wasp, 
chances for a standalone will skyrocket.
Ant-Man and the Wasp is set for release on July 6, 2018, 
directed by Peyton Reed and starring Paul Rudd and 
Evangeline Lilly.
Zack Snyder On Wonder Woman In New DC 
Cinematic Universe
Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice is the ?rst time 
Batman and Superman will be on screen together, but 
director Zack Snyder and Warner Bros. are pushing the 
envelope even further by including the most powerful 
female character ever created: Wonder Woman. Now 
this is not news to anyone (she is featured in the most 
recent trailer), but the standalone Wonder Woman ?lm, 
directed by Patty Jenkins, is currently in production. 
Snyder spoke with Empire Magazine regarding the 
introduction to the character:
“It was incredibly organic how Wonder Woman came 
into the story, the whole concept came of, ‘Let’s not 
save anything. Let’s try it all.’ Then Wonder Woman’s 
entrance made us realize we were much closer to the 
Justice League than we thought. We realized we were 
one movie away.”
Snyder expanded on the nature of the ?rst theatrical 
adaptation of Princess Diana and gave some basic 
details on the upcoming ?lm. “Her sexuality is part of 
her power, but she is also a feminist icon. Gender has 
been a hot topic, so it is very timely to bring her back. 
The way we have approached it, especially in the 
standalone movie, that is de?nitely there. Looking back 
and doing an origin story — and it is a period piece — 
see the role of women through history. There is a great 
source of humor in that now. It is so unbelievable you 
can’t even fathom it. You are still making a statement, 
but having some fun with it.”
It has been reported that Wonder Woman has a very 
small role in Batman v. Superman, so audiences will 
most likely require a true origin story. Batman v. 
Superman: Dawn of Justice will release on March 25, 
2016. Wonder Woman is slated to hit theaters on June 
23, 2017.

After three years of delays and teasers, Rihanna’s eighth 
studio album, Anti, has been ?nally released. Anti 
represents an intriguing change of form for Rihanna. It is 
less commercial than her previous albums; it was released 
overnight on Tidal much like Beyonce’s 2013 self-titled 
album. None of Rihanna’s recent singles are on Anti 
except “Work,” and overall, the album is less pop and has 
a more minimalist tone.
In a recent MTV interview Rihanna explained what she 
hoped to do in her new album: “I wanted songs that I 
could perform in 15 years; I wanted an album that I could 
perform in 15 years,” she said. “Not any songs that were 
burnt out. I ?nd that when I get on stage now, I don’t 
want to perform a lot of my songs. They don’t feel like me. 
So I want to make songs that are timeless.”
Anti is not a complete departure from the Rihanna we 
know and love, however. At her best, Rihanna’s songs 
are brilliantly produced pieces of pop that showcase 
her distinct personality, whether it’s expressing 
bombastic pride, emotional fragility, or playful seduction. 
“Consideration,” featuring R&B singer SZA, kicks off the 
album with a dark, minimal beat and features Rihanna’s 
voice in her signature Caribbean styling. The way she 
says, “I got to do things my way, darling” in the chorus is 
very much in line with the bad girl image she’s portrayed 
over the years.
At her worst, however, her songs are repetitive, 
unimaginative, club bangers that are all too willing to 
fall back on being able to bill themselves as Rihanna 
songs rather than trying to stand as works on their own. 
Case in point: “Work,” featuring rapper/singer Drake, is 
one of those Rihanna songs whose chorus repeats the 
name of the song a thousand times over until it becomes 
completely meaningless. Drake’s verse in the song isn’t 
anything spectacular either; it sounds like the generic 
R&B songs he would have been singing at the start of his 
career rather than the distinctly moody songs he has been 
producing recently.
For the most part, though, Rihanna’s worst songs on this 
album are not bad in a loud and obnoxious way; instead, 
they are bad in the sense that it feels like slowly dying 
of a nosebleed: they are horribly boring and feel like they 
will never end. “Woo” features a noisy electronic beat 
that never changes; it is the same three dissonant notes 
playing over and over again, and becomes tiresome very 
quickly. Rihanna’s voice also has noisy ?lter on it, and 
doesn’t stand out much over the beat. Unfortunately, 
at 3:55 this is one of the longer songs on the album. 
“Needed Me,” produced by DJ Mustard, is Rihanna’s take 
down of a former lover. The minimalist beat in this song 
sounds like it needs a dark, moody, and unforgiving set 
of vocals and lyrics to make it work. Instead, Rihanna’s 
disinterested tone just makes the song as a whole sound 
watered down and uninteresting.
Most songs on the album thankfully do not fall into this 
category. They are enjoyable but noticeably ?awed. “Kiss 
It Better” has a unique 80s-inspired instrumental featuring 
an electric guitar. The instrumental is interesting the ?rst 
time you hear it, but lacks any sense of progression. It 
remains exactly the same throughout the course of the 
song. “Desperado” has the same problem. The galloping, 
spaghetti Western inspired beat and lyrics about a pair of 
loners running off together is fun at ?rst, but doesn’t seem 
to change at all from start to ?nish and becomes stale 
by the end. “Same Ol’ Mistakes” is Rihanna’s cover of a 
Tame Impala song, “New Person, Same Old Mistakes.” It’s 
a great song, but Rihanna’s version is exactly the same as 
the original song and adds nothing new.
Some songs just have no presence. “Yeah, I Said It,” a 
sex jam produced by Timbaland, seems a little hollow. 
Rihanna repeats the words “Yeah, I said it” like she’s 
actually said something shocking when in reality she 
hasn’t. “James Joint” is a short one minute interlude 
about getting high that is weirdly shoved in between 
two songs that would have ?owed well into each other 
otherwise.
On this album, the best songs are the acoustic songs 
reminiscent of her performance on “FourFiveSeconds,” 
that truly let her show off her skills as a vocalist. This 
group includes “Never Ending,” “Love on the Brain,” 
“Higher,” and “Close To You.” As a reviewer, I may be 
a little biased because I’m a complete sucker for more 
acoustic retro-sounding songs, but these last four songs 
on Anti really seem to be the most ?eshed out songs in 
terms of composition. Rihanna’s voice is beautiful and 
brimming with emotion, and the songs feature some 
very well-written lyrics. The opening verse of “Close to 
You” is an elegy for a dying relationship: “Nothing but a 
tear, that’s all for breakfast/Watching you pretend you’re 
unaffected.”
On “Higher,” Rihanna opens with “This whiskey got me 
feelin’ pretty/So pardon if I’m impolite.” As she begs her 
lover to be with her she croons, “And I know I could be 
more creative/And come up with poetic lines.” It is a 
heartbreakingly beautiful two-minute song whose only 
?aw is that it is not any longer.
These last four songs also form a coherent arc in which 
Rihanna falls in love again after heartbreak, becomes 
unsure about the future of the relationship, and eventually 
ends up falling apart with her lover again. It really leaves 
you wondering what the album might have been if the 
rest of songs had been more like this.
Tidal listeners had access to three additional songs: 
“Goodnight Gotham,” an atmospheric albeit repetitive 
interlude piece, “Pose,” which sounds like it’s trying too 
hard to be “Fresh off the Runway,” and “Sex With Me,” 
which has the playful ?irtatious energy that “Yeah, I Said 
It” so desperately needs.
Anti seems like an album in a confused transition. In 
fact, it completely changes its tone halfway through 
from dark minimalist R&B to acoustic soul. Compared 
to past Rihanna albums, Anti may be more daring but 
simultaneously underwhelming. It seems to be exploring 
its options; it plays around with a couple of good ideas 
but doesn’t take too much time to develop any of them. 
More than anything, Anti leaves you wondering what 
direction Rihanna is planning to pursue in the future.

Chinese food is one of those types of cuisine that tastes 
different in every country you go to. In India, where I 
live, it’s loaded with spices to excite the palette and 
full of vegetarian renditions of common Chinese fast 
food classics such as “Gobi Manchurian” (made with 
cauli?ower), in lieu of chicken manchurian of course. In 
America, I’ve found that Chinese food takes the names 
of what I assume are historical ?gures (General Tso’s 
Chicken, anyone?) and is mellowed down to better suit 
the taste of the typical American customer. Because of 
this, when I eat Chinese food in Pittsburgh, I ?nd myself 
scanning the menu for different versions of the generic 
dishes that I’ve indulged in countless times. It was this 
routine I had gotten into that pushed me into a state 
of uneasiness when looking at the menu at Everyday 
Noodles.
The restaurant sits on Forbes Avenue in Squirrel Hill, 
walking distance from the Cold Stone and Rite Aid on 
the intersection of Murray and Forbes. Inside, the lights 
are bright and the tables are usually packed with vibrant, 
chatty customers of all age groups. I highly recommend 
— if possible — sitting at the bench seat, which is 
positioned right in front of the glass window that looks 
into the kitchen. Through the glass you can see the 
dumplings and noodles being prepared from scratch. The 
way the chefs kneed the dough and carefully pull it to 
craft the noodles and dumplings served hot to customers 
is mesmerizing. Of course, most of the seats in the 
restaurant have a view of the signature glass pane, to add 
to the authentic feel that the food carries with it, so if you 
can’t get the bench seat, don’t feel too discouraged.
The decor of the restaurant is simple and ?ts the 
atmosphere well. A cushioned bench lines one wall and 
has thin bamboo-like structures lining it from the top of 
the back-rest to the interface between the wall and the 
ceiling. There are tables scattered about, and the staff 
does a great job of making sure they can ?t in as many 
people as possible. If you go on a particularly busy night, 
you might have to wait for a while before you get a seat, 
so do plan ahead if you happen to be in a rush.
I cannot count how many times I’ve been to this 
restaurant, but I can count the number of dishes I’ve 
had. I’m usually not one for repetition, but after ?nding 
my share of favorites at Everyday Noodles, I ?nd myself 
craving the signature tastes that my mind has come to 
associate with the establishment. Here are some personal 
favorites:
Pork Soup Dumplings: This is one food item that I 
cannot visit Everyday Noodles without eating. Eight of 
these steaming hot, delicately crafted bundles of ?avor 
come with every order, ready to eat. The dumplings look 
relatively simple on the outside, but on the inside contain 
a small piece of pork and soup for it to ?oat around in. The 
dumplings are made fresh and are therefore very hot, so 
here’s a little trick my friend taught me to eat them if you 
can’t wait for them to cool down:
Step 1: The dumplings come with large soup spoons, and 
they do much more than catch any soup that might leak 
out of ruptured dumplings. The ?rst thing you do here, is 
carefully lift one dumpling out of the steamer basket and 
place it on your spoon.
Step 2: Poke a tiny hole in the dumpling. You can do this 
either with a chopstick or if you trust yourself, by biting a 
small piece of the dumpling off. 
Step 3: Using your chopstick, press down on the dumpling 
from the top and let the soup seep into the spoon out 
of the dumpling to surround it. Now that it’s out of the 
inside, it’ll be able to cool down faster. Go ahead and sip.
Step 4: Now that the dumpling’s got a good amount of 
soup squeezed out of it, and a hole to cool off the insides, 
it should be ready to pop into your mouth after sitting for 
a little longer.
By the time you’ve eaten a few like this, the rest should 
have cooled down amply enough for you to eat them 
whole and let the soupy, doughy, meaty concoction 
explode in your mouth. It’s heavenly.
Minced Pork Rice Bowl: I’m a teriyaki addict, so I’m 
usually a little weary of savory rice bowls that air on the 
saltier side, but this dish is de?nitely an exception. It 
consists of what it promises: minced pork and rice, along 
with some vegetables and a boiled egg. What I enjoy 
so much about this bowl is the fact that it can be eaten 
deconstructed, or heavily mixed together and still taste 
phenomenal. Each of the individual elements is cooked 
and ?avored very speci?cally, which results in great 
individual ?avors as well as great integrated ?avors. It’s 
?lling, it’s warm and it’s a great dish to share with friends.
Egg Yolk Bun: At ?rst glance, this doesn’t seem like a 
dessert item. The lovely, round, ?uffy bun comes with an 
egg yolk ?lling that is sweetened up just enough not to be 
overwhelming. Again, this arrives hot, and is an unusual 
?avor, but is something that has so far agreed with the 
palettes of all whom I’ve taken out for a bite. It’s an easy 
dare for the blossoming food experimentalist.
Bok Choy in Vegetable Oyster Sauce: All meals require 
some sort of balance, and here I’ve found some rich 
greens in a tangy sauce to be perfect. The restaurant has 
a variety of greens to choose from, but the bok choy is by 
far my favorite. It’s leafy enough not to be overwhelming, 
and soft enough to munch on between mouthfuls of rice

or noodles. The vegetables can also come with minced 
pork sauce, but I’ve found it helpful to have something 
vegetarian and neutral for the table, especially when 
with a group.
Jasmine Green Tea: I love tea with my food, whether 
at home or at a restaurant, and at this restaurant the 
green tea comes in the form of what looks like a sapling. 
The triangular prism bag is topped with a green wire 
with a small plastic leaf attached to it, that pokes out of 
the heartily sized tea cup, infusing tea steadily. Free hot 
water re?lls are available, and the intensity of the bag, if 
rationed out carefully, can last a good 2–3 cups. It’s light, 
and washes down the heavy food items effectively.
If you’re more of a noodle bowl lover and are inclined 
to see how the namesake dishes live up to your 
expectations, there are quite a few noodle bowls to 
choose from. The soup noodles bowls are quite large and 
very ?lling, while the dry noodles bowls are more realistic 
in terms of one-sitting consumption goals.
There are also some dishes on the menu that are 
unfamiliar to the typical Americanized Chinese menu, 
such as the House Oxtail Soup. I’ve only had the 
pleasure to taste a handful of these, and was particularly 
intrigued by the cool, refreshing, jelly?sh salad.
The restaurant also happens to have a broad selection 
of delicious bubble tea, if that’s the way your taste buds 
want to go.
Heads up:
Cha-ching: The restaurant takes cards and cash and is 
great with splitting checks for large groups.
Veggie stuff: There are NOT a whole lot of vegetarian 
mains here, but those that are present have been tried 
and tested by friends of mine. For vegetarians I would 
highly recommend the vegetable dumplings, which are 
made with a similar level of ?nesse as the pork soup 
dumplings. I would argue, in fact, that the dumplings 
are what most sing praise for. Other vegetarian options 
are marked on the menu with an encircled “v,” and the 
waiters have been very helpful in the past with pointing 
out vegetarian options and vegetarian versions of some 
dishes.
Are we there yet?: All of the 61 buses will get you to 
Forbes and Murray from campus, where you can easily 
walk to your ?nal destination. Taking an Uber is also not 
a bad option, although taking the bus to Squirrel Hill is 
de?nitely simpler than it is for other locations. Here’s a

foot: 5875 Forbes Ave, Pittsburgh PA 15217

For those stay-at-home days: This place has a great 
FREE home delivery service, with a $15 minimum for 
the order to be delivered, that lasts through restaurant 
kitchen operation hours. I’ve found ordering straight 
from the restaurant (as opposed to grubhub, for example) 
to be very effective, as they are careful to keep the food 
hot for when it arrives at your doorstep. This is especially 
great for the pork soup dumplings, which reach their 
optimal “eat-in-one-bite” temperature once they arrive.

Rash Alert: Gluten, nuts, dairy, soy, eggs, shell?sh — 
there are a lot of common allergies that can be triggered 
here, so be sure to ask the waiter what is in your dish 
before you try it, especially if you are particularly 
sensitive to any of the ingredients I mentioned, or any 
other ingredients in typical Chinese cuisine.
Ambience: Lively, friendly, relaxed.
College student friendly?: Very much so. It’s a hot spot 
for families, college students, couples of all ages and — 
on occasion — some high schoolers looking for a quick 
bite before heading home. Given it’s location, it gets 
attention from a wide variety of audiences.

Last Friday starting at 6:30 p.m., students from around 
campus met in the backyard of Stever House to 
celebrate Lohri. Native to the region of Punjab in India 
and Pakistan, Lohri is a festival with ancient roots.
Typically coinciding with the end of winter and the 
passing of the solstice, Lohri brings together members 
of the community for a night of lively festivities. Punjab, 
the only region that straddles India and Pakistan, is 
known as the “breadbasket” of India because of its 
fertile soil. Farming has been an integral part of life in 
the region for millennia, and the festival celebrates the 
beginning of the winter wheat harvest. Lohri is a cultural 
event celebrated by Sikhs, Hindus, and Muslims, who 
share a common heritage despite the political and 
religious divisions prevalent today.
Geographically, Punjab sits at the northwestern corner 
of the Indian subcontinent and has borne the brunt of 
homeland invasions from the time of Alexander the 
Great. A popular legend associated with Lohri is that of 
Dulla Bhatti. This Punjabi version of Robin Hood lived 
in the middle ages, rescuing girls from being sold into 
slavery during times of turmoil. Many of the traditional 
Lohri songs commemorate Dulla Bhatti. Punjab is also 
the birthplace of the Sikh religion, which blends together 
philosophies of Hinduism and Islam. The region is very 
culturally diverse, and Punjabi food, dance, and people 
have come to represent the whole of India abroad.
In Punjab, Lohri festivities take on many different 
manifestations. In some parts, children go from house to 
house singing traditional songs. As a reward, they are 
given jaggery or solidi?ed sugarcane extract. Bon?res 
are a signi?cant part of Lohri celebrations and serve as 
the focal point for the activities once the sun begins to 
set. Bhangra, a traditional Punjabi folk dance, is usually 
performed around the ?re during Lohri. Traditional 
snacks include ?re-cooked corn and sesame seeds.
Carnegie Mellon’s version of Lohri featured 
performances by the school’s Bhangra team and 
Deewane, the South Asian a cappella group. True to 
tradition, the celebrations centered around a large 
bon?re, with people huddling close for warmth on the 
chilly evening. A table was decked with snacks and 
refreshments. Corn was cooked by the ?re according to 
ancient tradition, while s’mores added a more modern 
?air. Many felt as though Friday’s celebration was an 
improvement over last year’s event, when there was 
snow on the ground, and the temperature was well 
below freezing.
In the weeks leading up to the event, a Facebook 
campaign called “Pics with Punjabis” was used as a 
lighthearted way to advertise the holiday, with people 
taking sel?es with participating Punjabis. Contests were 
held for the most creative picture and the most pictures 
overall, with winners receiving Chipotle gift cards. The 
event overall was very successful, bringing together 
members of the Carnegie Mellon community in much 
the same way as Lohri celebrations in Punjab. People 
socialized, enjoyed the food and drink, and got to learn a 
little bit about Punjabi culture.
The event was organized by CMU OM, a multi-faith 
Indian cultural and spiritual organization, which is 
responsible for other popular events on campus, like 
Diwali Garba and Holi.

the evolution of a form over time from the application of 
external forces — pressure, tension, and constriction. 
Strain is the struggle of an organism to survive. Through 
the past twenty years, Lunar Gala has strained to 
evolve beyond the usual, accepted, and proper, and 
will continue to do so for years to come. This year will 
mark Lunar Gala’s 20th Anniversary, so the show will be 
nothing like you’ve ever seen.

TartanHacks is an annual, student hackathon run by Scottylabs that took place 
from Friday, Feb. 5 to Saturday, Feb. 6 this year. Teams of up to four people 
participated in the two-day event. Surviving on pizza and coffee, teams spent 
the two days working to ‘hack’ their way to develop and realize interesting ideas 
such as an app that lets Carnegie Mellon students search Blackboard as they 
would Google, and a real–time collaborative task–management app.
