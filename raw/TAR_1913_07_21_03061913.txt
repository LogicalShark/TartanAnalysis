HOME CONCERT PROGRAM 
ANNOUNCED.
SEASON ENDS THIS WEEK 
LAST GAME SATURDAY
The Varsity defeated Muskingum 
last Friday night at the Gym by the 
score of 37-22. The game was too 
much broken up by fouls for any con­
tinued team-work, but Tech had what 
little there was. Heisel and Criswell 
made the best showing during the first 
Ixalf by good guard work and clever 
passing. The score at the end of the 
first half was 12-11 in favor of the visi­
tors. Tech took a brace in the sec­
ond and although 21 fouls were called 
on our boys against Muskingum’s 14, 
they succeeded in running up 26 points 
while the visitors were making 10. 
Colvin and Criswell were more suc­
cessful in locating the basket, the 
former dropping 4, the latter 3. Due 
to the excellent guarding of the home 
team, Muskingum scored but one field 
goal in this half. The lineup:

THE JUNIOR PROM.
Once more has the Hotel Schen- 
ley been the scene of gay revelry— 
the Junior Prom. One and all, those 
present agree, that this was the most 
successful social function ever held 
in C. I. T. Too much credit can not 
be given Chairman Holzworth and his 
able committee for the excellence 
with which.they planned and executed 
even the smallest detail.
The music, furnished by Signor 
Scalzo, was of the highest order. The 
decorations and the arrangement of 
the booths, were tasteful and charm­
ing.
The supper was perfect in its ap­
pointments, and formed a delightful 
interlude in the otherwise perfect 
evening.
The regular program of dances 
lasted until 3:30, after which the or­
chestra very kindly favored us with 
a half hour’s additional dancing.
The attendance was all that could 
be desired, there being 110 couples 
present.
In short the Prom surpassed all 
expectations, and the pleasure we all 
derived from it will always remain 
fresh in our memories.
Owing to a slight hitch in arrange­
ments, Manager Grotefend of the 
baseball team, has found it impossible 
to take his squad to the Southland, 
and, as Winter still rules at the Farm, 
the men cannot be sent North for 
some time. In spite of these discour­
agements, the number of candidates 
is steadily increasing and the men 
are slowly coming into shape. The 
work, as yet, is confined to light ex­
ercises to loosen up stiff muscles 
without -unnecessary strain. Almost 
all of last year’s men are out, with 
the exception of Pitcher Carts and 
Catcher Wehr, and are already dis­
playing old-time form. Capt. Gear­
hart, diminutive shortstop, gives a 
daily lecture on “The Value of Pep,” 
giving illustrations of different varie­
ties of the commodity. The prac­
tices are being held on Mondays and 
Wednesdays at 4:30 and on Satur­
days at 10 o’clock. New men will be 
specially welcomed.
TECH RIFLE TEAM.
There has been an urgent call from 
some of the students of C. I. T. for 
the organization of a rifle team to 
represent the schools in this branch 
of sport. It is generally known that 
we have a number of expert marks­
men; and in view of this fact, we see 
no reason why a creditable team could 
not be placed in the field. This team 
could not only compete with, but 
could make other college teams “go 
some” to beat them.
The eastern colleges, Yale, Prince­
ton, Harvard, Dartmouth, and others, 
have recently closed an “Intercol­
legiate Championship Shoot,” which 
was very interesting. Why could we 
not organize an “All Western Penn­
sylvania Matchi” All those who are 
interested are asked to meet in the 
Science Club Room at 4 P. M. Thurs­
day for discussion of the proposition.
ILLUMINATING LABORATORY.
The program for the eighth annual 
home concert contains several num­
bers of high merit. “The Cavalier’s 
Song” which will be used by the 
Glee Club in the first double number, 
is a recent composition by Werren- 
rath for the New York University 
Glee Club, being used by them in their 
Nineteen Ten concert work and rec­
ommended to student leader Craw­
ford by the Schirmer music house, of 
New York City. It was published for 
the first time, this year. Swing Along, 
the ninth number, has been published 
but a few months, and was given as 
a trial by the same publishers. Tos- 
ti’s “Good Bye” needs little intro­
duction. Sung by the great soloist, 
Caruso, and others, for the Victor 
Victrola Company, it has recently 
been arranged by Parks and will be 
used as the eleventh number.
“Under the Double Eagle,” by the 
great composer, Wagner, will be 
played by the Mandolin Club as the 
second number. “Lovely Night,” 
taken from a part in the opera, “Les 
Contes de Hoffmann,” will be played 
and sung by the combined musical 
clubs. This piece is better known as 
the “Barcarolle from the Tales of 
Hoffmann.” The program follows:

The illumination laboratory has re­
ceived from the General Electrical 
Co. a new type of daylight light to be 
tested to ascertain the proximity with 
which its light approaches that of 
daylight. It consists of a Thompson 
Intensified Arc over a light filter con­
sisting of several plates of glass which 
diffuse the light so that it is almost ex­
actly similar to sunlight. The chief 
use of these lamps is in matching col­
ors, as they are too -inefficient to be 
used for illuminating purposes.
The basketball season will be closed 
this week by a game with Geneva at 
the Field House, Saturday evening. 
On Friday night the Varsity will play 
its last foreign game, meeting the 
Westinghouse Club team in Wilkins- 
burg. According to dope, the Car­
negie team should take both games 
easily, putting an appropriate finish­
ing touchNto a successful season. It 
is hoped that the students will con­
tinue the excellent support they have 
given the team, and turn out for these 
last two games in record-breaking 
numbers.

Notable Engine To Be Erected in 
Power-House.
There is at present being erected 
in the powerhouse of the new Ma­
chinery Hall, a Stumpf Uni Flow 
steam engine constructed by the Mes- 
ta Machine Company. This engine 
is the only one of its type in exist­
ence, and its operation will be at­
tended with much interest by the en­
gineering profession of the country.
The engine produces 750 horse­
power, and is directly connected to 
a 500 kilowatt Westinghouse direct 
current generator. The valve action 
is of the Corliss type, but the valves 
themselves are the most striking de­
parture from the usual steam engine 
design. The exhaust valves are so 
placed that they are covered by the 
piston when live steam is admitted 
to the cylinder, thus insuring against 
valve leakage. The makers guaran­
tee better economy with this engine 
than with the ordinary type of steam 
prime movers.
The original design as tried out in 
Germany was not a success, but at 
the expiration of the patent rights, 
the Mesta Company brought out some 
improvements and embodied these 
with the present engine.
As soon as the Stumpf engine is 
in operation, the two gas engines will 
be removed from their present sta­
tion in the power house in the in­
dustry building to the new power 
plant.
'Several additions have recently 
been made to the equipment in the 
laboratories of Machinery Hall. 
Among these are a 8-in., by 10-in. 25
H. P. experimental engine in the sta­
tionary laboratory and two Alberger 
fiof Water Heaters and a Lea Re­
cording Feed Water Meter in the 
boiler room.

When it was decided to start at Car­
negie a new course combining en­
gineering and business there were 
many who scoffed at the idea, and, 
unfortunately, some of these mis­
guided individuals have continued 
their scoffings to his late date. It 
was with much interest, therefore,m -that we read in the Harvard Alumni 
Bulletin an article dealing with the 
advantages to the graduate School of 
Engineering of having the graduate 
School of Business Administration un­
der the same roof, so to say. We 
have taken the liberty of reprinting 
the editorial in full and trust that it 
may do something to convince the 
few remaining scoffers of the errors 
of their ways.
The suggestion in the January num­
ber of “The Harvard Engineering 
Journal” that students of engineering 
should not neglect the instruction in 
the economic principles which gov­
ern values in all engineering oper­
ations throws some new light on the 
new phrase “efficiency engineer.” As 
ordinarily used it means a man who, 
though not an engineer in the older 
sense, is an engineer in the etymologi­
cal sense of one who applies ingenu­
ity to working out problems. In these 
days of specialization the civil en­
gineer, or the electrical engineer, or 
the sanitary engineer must undergo 
long and arduous training in order 
to grasp the intricate conditions put 
before him and invent a plan that will 
meet them all. But since engineers 
do not deal with abstract problems, 
but with concrete realities, they must 
recognize the economic conditions in 
their undertakings; and it is here that 
their work interlocks with that of 
the efficiency or industrial engineers, 
for the latter are applying their train­
ed ingenuity directly to the reduc­
tion of cost and the increase of out­
put. In this work the industrial engi­
neer must frequently call on the me­
chanical engineer and the civil engi­
neer for aid. The Graduate Schools 
of Engineering and the Graduate 
School of Business Administration 
are training men who will not infre­
quently come to a single problem from 
two sides; and there is therefore every 
reason why engineering students 
should take advantage of the instruc­
tion offered in the Graduate School 
of Business Administration. In the 
future it will be recognized as no 
small part of the advantages of our 
Graduate Schools of Engineering that 
they are surrounded by other depart­
ments in the University.
In last week’s issue of The Tartan 
notice was given of a competition, 
open to members of the Sophomore 
and Freshmen classes, for positions 
on The Tartan Board. The hope was 
expressed that there would be a large 
turnout of candidates. Unfortunately 
this hope has not been fulfilled. The 
men who hâve expressed themselves 
as desirous of entering have been far 
too few: in number.
The Tartan Board is recruited from 
the lower classes by competition. As 
the men from the Senior class on the 
Board are graduated, their places are 
filled from the men chosen by the 
compétition. Thus a man coming out 
for The Tartan Board during his 
Sophomore year is reasonably cer­
tain of an editorial position in 
his Senior year, provided, of course, 
that his work is uniformly satisfac­
tory. The number of positions open 
is naturally limited, and it is desired 
to obtain the best possible men for 
them, men that will make The Tartan 
Board truly representative of the 
whole institution, not a part of it. 
Xo previous experience is necessary, 
merely an ability to write, think, and 
work. The Tartan Board again ex­
presses the hope that sufficient and 
good enough material will come out 
in this competition to insure the main­
tenance and upbuilding of the stand­
ard of thé Board for the coming 
year.
The attention of The Tartan has 
been called several times of late to 
the fact that the tables reserved for 
the Seniors in the Beanery are used 
by others than members of the Sen­
ior class. The rule that none but Sen­
iors should sit at the .special tables 
was adhered to for some time, and 
there came the gradual breakdown. 
The Seniors will not receive special 
privileges unless they demand them 
a little more strenuously than they 
do at the present time. On the other 
erately seats himself at a table he 
hand, the underclass man who delib- 
knows to be reserved for members 
of the Senior class is not worthy of 
becoming, at some future date, a mem­
ber of that class.
The Tartan trusts that in the fu­
ture the rules regarding the Senior 
tables will be strictly lived up to by 
members of all classes from all 
schools.
An editor sat in his easy chair, 
with troubled look and disheveled 
hair. An irate subscriber was stand­
ing by, with awful look and blood in 
his eye. The subscriber meant the 
writer to thrash, his optics to bruise, 
his nose to mash. He would wipe the 
earth with the editor bold, for tell­
ing facts he shouldn’t have told. The 
battle was brief, the carnage great, 
and the subscriber found out his mis­
take, ah—too late. He retired from 
the scene with bruises and pain, and 
he’ll never tackle an editor again.— 
Wooster Voice.
CORRESPONDENCE.
[The Editors of The Tartan are 
pleased at all times to receive com­
munications from any member of the 
Faculty or student-body upon sub­
jects of timely interest. Such articles 
as are deemed of sufficient interest 
will be published at the first oppor­
tunity. Anonymous communications 
cannot be considered, but the names 
of correspondents will be withheld 
when so desired.]
WE ASK WHY?
Why are we called Plebes instead 
of Freshmen? According to Web­
ster, Plebe means a vulgar person. 
Are we vulgar? Again according to 
Webster, Freshman means a first 
year man in an American school. That 
is precisely what we are, therefore, 
why not call us by that name. Just 
say each name over to yourself. A 
person cannot say Plebe without mak­
ing it sound degrading. Freshman 
on the other hand, is more pleasing 
to the ear. Carnegie is the only in­
stitution still holding on to the anti­
quated word, Plebe. Why should it 
be? The question arises, how can 
we get rid of it. Very simple. Quit 
using it. When you go to say Plebe, 
stop and think and say Freshman 
instead. I speak in behalf of all fu­
ture Freshmen.
The Tartan is a non-partisan paper. 
It is not controlled by any school, fra­
ternity, or group of students. It trys 
to reflect the sentiment of the whole 
student-body, and to stand the inter­
ests of the whole institution against 
those of any individual or group of 
individuals, be they what they may. 
These remarks are made by way of 
preface to comment upon the contro­
versy recently arisen ‘concerning the 
selection of a manager for the track 
team to succeed Mr. Engstrom, in 
order that any statements made here­
inafter may not be misunderstood by 
unbiased readers.
Mr. Engstrom, who had proved him­
self a capable manager, was forced 
to resign at the close of the first sem­
ester in order to devote more time to 
his class work. It is customary for 
the retiring manager of an athletic 
team to recommend to the Board of 
Control the man in his opinion best 
fitted to be his successor, after a com­
pétition has been held to determine 
upon that man. Mr. Engstrom, with-

Thought for the Week
“Education”, We are in pain to make 
them scholars but not men. To talk 
rather than to know, which is true canting. 
The first thing obvious to children is what 
is sensible, and that we make no part of 
their sediments. We press their memory
too soon and puzzle, strain, and load them 
with words and rules, leaving their natural 
genius to mechanical and physical or natu­
ral knowledge uncultivated and neglected. 
Children had rather be making of tools 
and instruments of play; shaping, drawing, 
framing, and building, etc., than getting 
some rules of propriety of speech by heart; 
and those also would follow with more 
judgment and less trouble and time.” 
William Penn, Some Fruits of Solitude.
“The Polar Tragedy”—Literary Digest, 
February 22, p. 381. A condensed history 
of the Scott Anarctic Expedition, with 
good pictures of Captain Scott and his 
wife and son.
“Our Mexican Duty”—Literary Digest, 
February 22, p. 384. Are the Mexicans 
fitted for self-government? A very ugly 
foreign problem which President Taft is 
leaving to his successor.
“Police Graft Confessions”—Literary 
Digest, February 22, p. 386. We have be­
fore us the prospect of a house-cleaning, 
the biggest and most important since 
Tweed’s day.
“Tobacco—Poison or Medicine”—-Liter­
ary Digest, February 22, p. 396. It may 
be, therefore, that tobacco, admittedly 
containing such a poison as nicotine, may 
be a valuable tonic or antiseptic under the 
proper conditions.
“Home-Made Lava to Fight Floods”— 
Literary Digest, February 22, p. 397. Mol­
ten slag has been used to coat the embank­
ments of the Wheeling & Lake Erie Rail­
road where it skirts the Ohio River.
“The Balkan War Begins Again”—Out­
look, February 15, p. 334.
“Bergson—Creator of a New Philos­

336. Henri Bergson, “a great new phil­
osopher”, is now in America and has been. 
delivering lectures before large audiences 
at Columbia University.
“Who Broke the Window?”—Outlook, 
February 15, p. 347. Answers to the ques­
tion whether the pupil who knows should 
tell when the teacher asks, “Who broke 
the window?”
“Amateur Athletics”—Outlook, Febru­
ary 15, p. 344. Interesting comments on 
the Thorpe case and amateur athletics in

women of Philadelphia caused the price 
of eggs in that city to be cut almost in

“The Nation’s White Coal”—Outlook, 
February 15, p. 338. Electricity is rapidly 
contesting the supremacy of steam. It 
requires no great exercise of the imagina­
tion to see ourselves passing over the 
threshold from the age of steam into the 
age of electricity; and to see in the “white 
coal”, as is has been aptly called, of the 
falling waters of river and stream, the 
supplanter of the black coal of the mine.

The first social event of the Tech 
Studio Club occurred last Thursday 
evening at the home of Brady Mc- 
Swegan. As they say in the classics, 
“Some time, believe me.” Eats, smokes, 
piano music, vocal noise, and last but 
not least a sleight of hand performance 
by Prof. Holmes, head of the Illus­
trating Department. Prof. Solemn de­
lighted every one present with his 
clever, witty stories. Professors 
Sparks, Sotter and Taylor were also 
there and contributed their share of 
the evening’s entertainment. Cards 
were also indulged in. Quite a dis-' 
cussion was carried on with regard to 
the future work of the club. It was 
decided to give an exhibition at an 
e»rly date and we’re sure the entire 
school is with us in wishing them all 
the success possible.

4THE TARTAN
INSPECTION TRIP TO NEW 
YORK.
(This article furnished through the 
kindness of Prof. Thayer.)
The department of Civil Engi­
neering had been considering for some 
time an inspection trip to New York 
City. The numerous large projects 
now under construction, many of 
them so different from those seen 
in our own district, render it an ideal 
location for engineering excursions. 
It was my great fortune to be chosen 
to accompany the students in the in­
terest of the schools. A favorable 
arrangement of the examinations al­
lowed me to leave Pittsburgh Tues­
day noon, the extra three daj^s thus 
abstracted being employed in a visit 
to the Civil Engineering Department 
of Penn State, Lehigh University and 
Lafayette.
On assembling in New York, Sat­
urday February 8th, we first visited 
the Brooklyn Bridge. This historic 
suspension bridge has a central span 
of 1595 feet and was finished in 1883 
at a cost of $18,000,000. We next ex­
amined the Manhattan Bridge nearby, 
paying especial attention to its an­
chorages. This, also a suspended 
structure, was recently completed at 
a cost of $21,000,000, it has a central 
span of 1470 feet and a length over 
all of 5780 feet. In the afternoon we 
made a tour of the docks in the -navy 
yard and went all over the Dela­
ware, a first class battle ship laid 
up for an overhauling.
On Monday we first saw the lower 
tiers of steelwork for what is to be 
the 32 story building of the Adams 
Express Company’s building, visited 
the stock Exchange and the Curb, 
where the brokers sell stocks and 
bonds out doors in all kinds of weath­
er. Our next venture was 700 feet 
below the heart of the city, where 
we saw them blasting out solid rock 
for the 16 foot tube, which will bring 
to the Metropolis, water from the 
Catskills, 110 miles away, at a cost 
of $170,000,000. In the faternoon we 
saw Manhattan Island from the top 
of the highest building in the world, 
the Woolworth Building, 750 feet 
above the streets.
Tuesday was rather stormy. Nev­
ertheless, we inspected the docks and 
a pier in the course of construction, 
an emergency pumping station, and 
the Williamsburg Bridge, the latter 
a structure much like the Manhattan 
already mentioned. A portion of the 
afternoon was spent at Columbia Col­
lege.
Wednesday we examined the swing 
drawbridge over the Harlem river at 
221st Street, the magnificent Wash­
ington Arch at 181st Street, also an 
arch carrying the elevated sub­
way at 125th Street. After din­
ner, we saw Grant’s Tomb on
the Hudson, and then took the cars 
for Andrew Carnegie’s residence. Al­
though he had no word whatever of 
our coming, the simple statement that 
we, from his school in Pittsburgh, 
wished to pay him our respects, 
seemed to be all sufficient, and we 
spent a very pleasant hour with our 
Founder. He inquired very particu­
larly for the Schools and spoke very 
nicely of our Director, Before leav­
ing he made each of us a present of a 
pamphlet which he had written and 
in which he placed his autograph.
Thursday morning we passed very 
instructively, at the Grand Central 
Terminal, an improvement represent­
ing an investment of $150,000,000. That 
afternoon we visited Lindenthal’s of­
fice and examined the plans for the 
new Hell Gate Bridge which will give 
an all rail direct route from the South 
and Southwest to New England.
Friday morning we journeyed 20 
miles north to Kensico to visit the 
site of what will be the highest dam 
in the world. This is a part of the 
Catskill aqueduct system, serving to 
impound a 60 days supply of water 
for the use of the Metropolitan dis­
trict in case of accident. Some idea 
as to the magnitude of the proposi­
tion may be gleaned from the fact that 
the contractor has spent a million dol­
lars for his plant alone. The trip to 
Philadelphia was made that afternoon.
Our first trip in the City of Broth­
erly Love was to the Mint. Even if 
the coins were only pennies, it was 
very trying to men at the close of a 
somewhat expensive trip. Our final 
excursion was to the Queen’.s Lane 
Filtration Plant. Here we officially 
disbanded, some men going on to Bal­
timore and Washington on a quest for 
further information. Most of us ar­
rived in Pittsburgh Sunday evening.
One very enjoyable feature was the- 
extreme courtesy showed us in every 
place which we visited. Not less pleas­
ing to me personally was the interest 
and enthusiasm displayed by every 
man in the party. I think that I may 
safely say that it was to me as well as 
to my students one of the most profit­
able and instructive journeys I have 
undertaken.
The second edition of Prof. Thayer’s 
new book, ‘‘Elements of Structural 
Design,” will appear very shortly, the 
first edition being already nearly ex­
hausted. 150 copies of the first edi­
tion have been sold in England. It is 
expected that Vol. II, “Design of 
Simple Structures,” will be ready 
about January 1, 1914.
REASON FOR FALLING OFF OF 
MATERIAL IN TARTAN.
There are a lot of funny things we 
might say in The Tartan, but we are 
saving them for the Thistle.
SENIOR HIGH SCHOOL 
STUDENTS ENTERTAINED
Last Monday afternoon the Mar­
garet Morrison Plebes entertained the 
Senior girls of the Pittsburgh High 
School. Miss Stoner, with her char­
acteristic originality, arranged several 
dances, the first one by the Sopho­
mores, the other two, by Junior girls, 
who are in her special dancing class. 
These dances were carried on before^ 
and between the halves of a most ex­
citing basketball game between the 
School team and the Alumni team. 
The score was very much on “one 
side,” but every one appreciated the

DESIGN SCHOOL GRADUATE 
ACHIEVING DISTINCTION.
Among the exhibits in the Archi­
tectural Exhibition at the Carnegie 
Institute is a bronze medallion of Lin­
coln, modelled by Miss Sue G. Wat­
son of the class of 1911, Design. The 
plaque consists of a beautifully mod­
elled head surrounded by a Roman 
wreath of bay leaves, the whole be­
ing given a handsome green tint by 
etching with acids.
The medallion is a high relief of 
heroic size and is scientifically cor­
rect, thus making it an excellent like­
ness from every point of view. This 
is something unusual in a medallion 
as they are usually executed for one 
point of view only. Much more skill 
is required in modelling a relief of 
this nature than in modelling a bust, 
as unusual talent is required in order 
to bring out a perfect likeness from 
every angle.
The casting of medallions and fig­
ures in bronze is exceedingly diffi­
cult and is undertaken by only a few 
foundries in the country. Much 
credit is due Mr. Dosey of the School 
of Applied Industries for the produc­
tion of such a finished piece of work.
At the close of the exhibition the 
medallion will be placed in the Birch- 
field Memorial Room of the Soldier’s 
Memorial Hall.
Among Miss Watson’s other de­
signs are busts of Judge McKenna 
and of Colonel Allen of this city. She 
is at present working on microscopi­
cal illustrations of the brain for a 
book by Dr. Sheldon of the University 
of Pittsburgh.
The Tech Drafting Club held their 
regular meeting on February 20, at

out holding a competition, recom­
mended to the Board of Control, Mr. 
Parry, a member of his own frater­
nity. Mr. Parry was recommended 
to and elected by the Board of Con­
trol the same day upon which Mr. 
Engstrom resigned. The Seannachie 
Society, a society composed of men 
from the three men’s schools, who 
have demonstrated their leadership in 
the various forms of student activity 
with which they have been connected, 
and of which Mr. Engstrom is a mem­
ber, took this matter under consid­
eration, discussing it thoroughly with 
Mr. Engstrom, and by unanimous 
vote appointed a committee consist­
ing of Messrs. Frank Crawford, 
George Blair, and A. E. Vail to see 
Mr. Parry and suggest to him that 
he instigate a competition for the 
position of managership of the 
Track Team. It was understood that 
Mr. Parry had agreed to do this, but 
up to the time of this writing, Mon­
day evening, has not done so.
The Tartan agrees heartily with the 
attitude taken by the Seannachie So­
ciety. The Athletic Constitution calls 
for competition in the selection of all 
the team managers. In the case at 
hand the spirit, if not the letter, of 
the Constitution was broken. There 
was no competition whatsoever, and 
only a very limited number knew of 
the affair until after it was all over. 
Mr. Parry has done some good work 
in connection with various social ac­
tivities, but has never had any ex­
perience with athletics. It is not 
against Mr. Parry or Mr. Engstrom 
that the action of the Seannachie and 
this article are directed, but against 
the practice and form of the election. 
It is unfortunate that this matter has 
come up at all. The Tartan did not 
make mention of it last week be­
cause it was hoped that the matter 
could be satisfactorily adjusted. Since 
it has not been, The Tartan feels that 
it is an incumbent duty to lay the 
matter before the whole student-body 
in order that they may take a hand 
in deciding what shall be the method of 
procedure in their Athletic Association.

APPLIED DESIGN SCHOOL 
NOTES.
Last week was a busy one for the 
Architects, being charette week on 
the Class “B” plan, order, and Arch­
aeology, and including the twelve- 
hour first preliminary for the Paris 
Prize.
The judgment of the last Class “A” 
projet, “A Catafalque,” resulted in 
nine mentions out of eleven sent in, 
with one set of drawings placed hors 
concours. The medals hoped for, 
failed to materialize (as usual); but 
we are still hoping for better “luck” 
on the next projet.
One of the visitors of the past week 
was Mr. Paul Cret, the professor of 
architecture at the University of 
Pennsylvania. Mr. Cret was in town 
especially to act on the jury for the 
judgment of the last class “B” projet 
on Monday last.
About sixteen men completed 
sketches for the first preliminary 
Paris Prize competition. The subject 
was “An Office Building Arcade.” 
Judgment will be given in New York 
March 17.
“Oh, there she is,” said Davy Evans 
smiling like a cherub, but oh horrors, 
it soon faded. There stood her Pa
and Ma.
John Wall casually remarked, “We 
feed the baby sausage, we want to 
weiner.”
Bill McKee is still working.
Louie Weld is some soft shoe foot 
artist. If you don’t believe us, ask 
Prof. McDougall.
Some of the Freshman architects 
have developed a sudden liking for
feminine society on Wednesday and 
Saturday Bights. All inquiries di­
rected to M. E. Boyer.

lar these days. We have such—tak­

officers for the coming semester. 
Class politicians had long been an­
ticipating the event and the election 
was hotly contested.
R. S. Wilson was re-elected presi­
dent for another semester. Wilson’s 
administration has been of such a 
character that his adherents deemed 
him worthy of a second term and so 
re-elected him.
