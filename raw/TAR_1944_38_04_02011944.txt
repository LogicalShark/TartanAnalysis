Carnegie Gives Eng. Juniors Release Changes 
Standard Technological Tests Deferment Status
Orientation Committee 
Greets New Freshmen 
With Many Activities
January 26, AC AC delegated the 
Interhonorary Council to handle 
the Freshman orientation for the 
freshmen entering Carnegie Tech 
this February.
Nick Reed was chosen from the 
Interhonorary Council as chairman 
of the Orientation Committee. The 
other members of the committee 
were also chosen from the Inter­
honorary Council. These commit­
teemen have been appointed to take 
care of one phase of the campus ac­
tivities. Ralph Simon and Don 
Worth will represent the “Y” cab­
inet; Nick Yaru, football; Tom Bok- 
man and Leo Fyer, publications; 
Ted Bellan, Glee Club, and Kiltie 
Band; Malcom Festenstein, AC AC 
and Basketball; Dick Bingham, 
business staffs of publications; Sam 
Duff, fraternities and football; Wil­
liam Emerson, APO; and Burt 
Faigen, Interfraternity Council.
The Orientation Committee has 
two objectives: first, to get fresh­
men out for activities; second, keep 
them interested in activities. 
When each freshman registers, he 
will fill out an activities card. This 
card will list all the activities in 
which he participated while in high 
school, and all of the activities he 
expects to get into while at Carne­
gie. Then the Orientation Commit­
teemen who have been assigned to 
each activity will interview him. 
One month later the freshman will
v again be interviewed in order to 
find out how well he has progress­
ed. The final interview will enable 
the freshman to try for another ac­
tivity or straighten out any dif­
ficulties that have come up.
Tuesday, February 8, the fresh­
men will attend an assembly to hear 
a talk on the school traditions. The 
following day they will be invited 
to a basketball game; the Orienta­
tions Committee will act as hosts. 
Then, all the freshmen will be in­
vited to attend the Freshman Tea 
Dance, with the Orientation Com­
mittee again as their hosts. On the 
following Friday a smoker will be 
held at the Carnegie Union. All the 
departments will send a representa­
tive to give them an idea of the 
type of work that they will be do­
ing.
The Orientation Committee hopes 
that this program will be successful, 
inasmuch as it is just developing 
this form of orientation. Nick Reed, 
the present chairman, also stated 
that when freshmen Margaret Mor­
rison girls enter Carnegie Tech 
some of the Orientation CommitteeSL’ members will be women.
There will be an important meet­
ing of all the members of the TAR­
TAN, or anyone who is working for 
the TARTAN, Friday, February 4, 
at 5 o’clock. Attendance is re­
quired.
The Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology is one of a few educational 
institutions selected to offer the 
Graduate Record Examination to 
its first-semester Juniors in the Col­
lege of Engineering by the Carnegie 
Foundation for the Advancement 
of Teaching.
The Graduate Record Examina­
tion is a series of tests designed to 
show the nature and extent of a 
student’s actual equipment in 
knowledge in comparison with 
groups having similar training. Its 
result supplements the college rec­
ord with an objective inventory of 
a student’s present mental re­
sources, however those resources 
may have been acquired. Further­
more, the test records of Carnegie 
Tech Juniors will be a measure of 
the proficiency of the students of 
this school in comparison with that 
of students of other selected insti­
tutions, and thus determine the 
standing of the Institute.
The Graduate Record Examina­
tion is composed of two sets of 
tests: the first set measures the stu-
skills which involve mathematics, 
physics, chemistry, etc.; the second 
set deals with the field of engineer­
ing exclusively. The scores in the 
Examination have but one meaning. 
They represent solely the student’s 
standing with respect to his knowl­
edge of the subjects tested.
In preparing these tests each sub­
ject is broken down into a great 
number of items in question form. 
Taken together, these items consti­
tute a complete inventory of the 
subject. Out of this pool many tests 
can be constructed—each test of­
fering a carefully chosen sample of 
all possible questions. Some ques­
tions are hard, some easy, and some 
moderately difficult. Thus the
AST Men Embark On 
Week of Furlough
Following a week of term ex­
aminations the AST men left for a 
week of furlough last Saturday, 
January 29. This exodus included 
all except the new group of engi­
neers who have recently arrived.
The furloughs officially began at 
noon, Saturday, but several exten­
sions were granted men who must 
travel to such distant locales as Cal­
ifornia and inner regions of Colo­
rado. By this means, the Army 
trusts, these fellows who live so far 
off will be given something more 
than the prospect of traveling some 
thousands of miles for the sake of 
a half-hour at home. The earliest 
departure was recorded at “C” 
Company, where one inhabitant of 
San Bernadino was allowed to leave 
for his West Coast home the night 
of Thursday, the 27th, doubling on 
several examinations in order to 
make his deadline.
So, the men in knaki say good-

chance factor can be so greatly re­
duced that a student would get 
about the same score on any test so 
constructed. That is to say, he can 
be sure of trustworthy measure of 
his knowledge of that subject.
The trustworthiness of the score, 
and the score of the Examination, 
determine its great importance. As 
more than 30,000 students will take 
the same examination, the score of 
each individual can be compared 
with the over-all average, the norm 
being length of schooling, field of 
study, type of institution, region, or 
any one of many others. Thus the 
results may be applied to almost 
every situation: aid in choice of vo­
cation, for example, by matching 
the achievement of the student 
against that of future colleagues or 
competitors; or evidence of superior 
knowledge used in attaining schol­
arships, military commissions, or in­
dustrial positions.
The Examination is of eight 
hours’ duration and will be given 
on Monday, February 7, and Mon­
day, February 14, from 1:30 p. m.
neering Hall. Each first-semester 
Junior in the College of Engineer­
ing is required to take all the tests. 
They will be excused from all reg­
ular classes during these hours. All 
further information may be obtain­
ed in the office of Dr. Webster N. 
Jones.
A good score in these tests will 
not only help you in many ways; 
it will also establish the superiority 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology. “I am confident that you 
will make every effort to excel in 
these tests. I solicit your heartiest 
cooperation.”
WEBSTER N. JONES, 
Director.
“Have Faith,” Subject of 
Rev. McClean In Chapel
Though the phrase “local lad 
makes good” may sound slightly 
outworn when applied to “just any­
one” it assumes an added meaning 
when it describes the colorful 
career of the Rev. David McClean, 
this week’s chapel speaker. Having 
been ordained last June, Mc­
Clean is now Assistant Pastor at the 
East Liberty Presbyterian Church. 
He attended Taylor Allderdice High 
School and the University of Pitts­
burgh before entering Western 
Theological Seminary. An all- 
around “fellow,” Reverend McClean 
went out for swimming and bowling 
while in school as well as study­
ing German, Greek, and Hebrew. 
His topic for discussion this morn­
ing will be “Have Faith.”

10,000 Students 
Is National Quota
The National Headquarters of the 
Selective Service System have just 
issued an amendment to the Bulle­
tin No. 33-6, which announces dras­
tic changes in the method of defer­
ment of college students. The fol-, 
lowing excerpts are of special im­
portance to Engineering and Sci­
ence students.
A. General Policy On Student De­
ferments :
1. Change in policy. The current
needs in connection with the war 
effort require a change in the pol­
icy governing the occupational de­
ferment of students. The Army and 
Navy Specialized Training Program 
is providing for the specialized 
training of a large number of men. 
This number will furnish a supply 
of persons in scientific and special­
ized fields and certain professions 
adequate for the needs of the arm­
ed forces. Therefore, students oc­
cupationally deferred should be 
limited to a number sufficient to 
meet civilian needs in war produc­
tion, and in' support of the war ef­
fort.
2. Student Quota. It is necessary 
that students in certain professional 
fields be considered for continued de­
ferment . . . National quotas have 
been determined in accordance with 
which occupational deferments may 
be granted to undergraduate stu­
dents in certain scientific and spec­
ialized fields.
B. Students, Scientific and Special­
ized Fields:
2. Undergraduate Students who will 
graduate after July 1, 1944. An un­
dergraduate student in a scientific 
or specialized field who will gradu­
ate after July 1, 1944, should be 
considered for occupational defer­
ment if he is a full-time student in 
good standing in a recognized col­
lege or university, and if he is cer­
tified as follows:
(a) By the institution that he is 
an undergraduate student majoring 
in a scientific or specialized field, and 
that he gives a promise of the suc­
cessful completion of his course of 
study;
(b) By the institution that if he 
continues his progress he will grad­
uate within 24 months from the date

2THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1944
£<tUo*uL AtUHcJiOiSlThe Outlook . . .
During the last week a sizeable 
body of prospective Army engineers 
arrived on the Campus, to become 
a part of the Carnegie AST. These 
men, following their fellows who 
have arrived a bit earlier, are here 
because they are good men in every 
sense of the word—keen of mind, 
body, and patriotism. They are here 
because they are needed to fill the 
multitude of tasks which lie ready 
for them, and for which they must 
have extensive and intensive train­
ing. They are also here to become 
a part of Carnegie.
These new men are not going to 
find the ASTP an easy, “push-over” 
affair, a smooth road to a commis­
sion or high rating, a guaranty 
of rapid advancement, an oppor­
tunity to enjoy themselves while 
adding to their education. They 
will, on the contrary, find only that 
work — hard, confining, restricting 
work—lies ahead of them. They will 
often feel that it simply is not worth 
it. They will wish for more leisure 
time. They will constantly be given 
more to do than can be easily ac­
complished. They will be placed 
under pressure. Their freedom will
We extend our sincerest regrets 
to the staff of Page Six in their re­
cent calamity. It seems that 
through no fault of theirs, their 
page makeup for the last issue was 
unnecessarily ruined by the ever 
bungling staff of the Tartan. For 
reference turn to the editorial in 
the Plaid section of this paper. It 
was truly unfortunate that the in­
terested members of the Evening 
School had to be deprived of two 
“current hot-off-the-wires” articles, 
one dealing with the results of the 
recent Post-Holiday Dance, and the 
other a vital letter to the editor 
which has been printed this week. 
And a measly 15-inch column coca 
cola ad, the good will and remuner­
ation from which, may we so basely 
materialistic as to state, is largely 
responsible for keeping the Tartan 
out of the red, into the white and 
free from the blues, was the cause 
of it all.
This unavoidable tragedy occur­
red where all unavoidable trage­
dies are wont to occur, at that hav-
be radically curtailed. But they will 
learn.
Basically, even now, they realize 
this, or soon will. The new men will 
come to understand that this is nec­
essary, that it is exactly why they 
are here, part of the ASTP. The 
Program is out to train men for 
men’s tasks, for aiding vitally in 
the winning of the war. It must be 
found out early whether or not they 
can “take it,” if they are fit to hold 
responsible, important, essential po­
sitions in the Army of the United 
States. They are supposed to be 
under constant pressure, to have 
more to do than can comfortably be 
taken care of, to be confined to a 
certain degree. They must prove 
themselves. Those incapable of 
proving themselves must be weed­
ed out. Those who make the grade 
will be the better soldiers, will have 
the more value to the Army because 
of it.
One thing is certain—not one man 
is incapable of making that grade, 
of coming through, of proving him­
self. If he were, he would not now 
be here.
Step right up, men, you can do it!
A. V. P.
en of bedlam technically known as 
the printers’. It was most unfortu­
nate that the Plaid staff wasn’t 
given the opportunity to use its own 
discretion in cutting the page, but 
we hardly thought they would ap­
preciate being torn from their jobs 
at 4:30 on Monday and asked to re­
make their page by 4:35. Since the 
Evening School staff has up to now 
been unable to represent them­
selves at the printers to make last 
minute changes and provide for 
sudden emergencies, they will have 
to accept our poor efforts on their 
behalf.
We all appreciate the high caliber 
of work that the Plaid puts out 
every Friday evening, but perhaps 
they do not realize that the work 
of actually assembling their page 
only begins on Monday when we 
must cut and rearrange their stories 
to fit. Up to now we f^el we have 
done a rather good job. We hope 
our unpardonable sin will not have 
too terrible an effect on the Even­
ing School morale. L. S.
Some day within the not too far 
future the last remains of German 
armed resistance shall have been 
crushed by the. Allied armies, and 
we shall then be confronted with 
the problem of reforming and re­
habilitating Germany. We shall un­
doubtedly begin by setting up an 
Allied Military Government, fol­
lowing the pattern of our Italian 
conquests, which will suffice for 
laying the foundation of reconstruc­
tion during the first few months. 
But then we shall be forced to set 
up a German government, as liberal 
as possible, which will have the 
gigantic job of building on the ruins 
of a beaten country a permanent 
and liberal political structure. To 
whom shall this responsibility be 
entrusted?
As soon as Hitler and his intimate 
confederates are eliminated, nine- 
tenths of the German bigwigs will 
suddenly claim that all along they 
were opposed to the Nazi regime, 
that they were forced to cooperate. 
For a few — very few — this really 
has been the case; it shall be our 
big job to sort the wheat from the 
chaff.
The majority of these “converts,” 
the opportuntists and would-be 
liberals, can be divided into three 
groups. There are first the peren­
nial diplomats, the political crafts­
men interested in nothing and no 
one but themselves, and therefore 
at least as dangerous as the dyed- 
in the-wool fascists. Aranz von 
Papen, at present German ambas­
sador in Turkey, is one of these; 
Baron Von Neurath, the former 
Protector of Czechoslovakia, an­
other. Turning with the political 
tide, these and others have held 
positions in every German govern­
ment from the days of the Kaiser 
until the Hitler regime and will un­
doubtedly again be “willing” to as­
sume an office under the coming 
government.
The second group comprises the 
outstanding experts in the various 
fields of administration. Best known 
in this group is Hyalmar Schacht, 
for many years president of the 
Deutsche Bank, and now in Switz-
Thirty-first Meeting 
January 26, 1944.
The meeting was called to order at 
5 20 p.m.
Present: Messrs. Festenstein, Wolff, Rob­
bins, Marcus, Fairchild; Misses Schadel, 
Rial, Skillington, and Bloom. 
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Special Committee
Miss Schadel reported that the activi­
ties keys have come in and that the heads 
of the various organizations on campus 
can pick them up in Mr. Murphy’s office 
and distribute them. The keys have al­
ready been sent to those persons who are 
no longer on campus.
Miss Skillington reported that the at­
tendance at the last assembly had been 
very encouraging. The next movie pro­
gram may be pictures of Pan-American 
interest.
Athletics
Mr. Robbins moved that the minutes of 
the Intramural Board meeting of January 
18 be accepted as read.
Motion carried.
Social
Miss Rial reported that Billy LeRoy’s 
orchestra will play for the Infantile 
Paralysis Benefit on Friday night instead 
of the Army band. The basketball game 
will be played between the Pitt dental 
students and the Tech A.S.T. trainees.
Mr. Fairchild moved that the cost of 
the March of Dimes Benefit game and
erland “for his health.” Although 
not in the limelight, he certainly is 
still one of Hitler’s intimate advis­
ors, and not the German Darlan 
which some people expect him to 
be. Then there is Krupp of arma­
ments fame, who has delivered 
guns and steel products to German 
an foreign governments of all 
creeds; he too will expect to retain 
his position in spite of a German 
defeat. Another of these “non­
partisans” is the famous Fritz Thys- 
seri, financial expert, who escaped 
to France in the beginning of the 
war and published his sensational 
and anti-German memoirs, but who 
made no attempt to evade his so- 
called enemies when Hitler invaded 
France in 1940. No punishment for 
his “treason” was ever reported, and 
one must assume him to be still in 
Hitler’s good graces. Yet he too 
will claim to be a sheep in wolf’s 
clothing.
The German imperialists, com­
prised mainly of the old clique of 
Prussian generals, form the last 
group. These men have only one 
interest: Germany, and they will 
adhere to any government or lead­
er that will appear to further Ger­
man interests. They know no 
peace; a lost war is just another 
battle, and peace a chance to map 
out future conquests. After the last 
war they never stopped planning 
another one, and if left in power, 
they will do the same this time.
This is the chaff—a lot of it. But 
there will be some good men; they, 
and they alone, should be allowed 
to take over the German govern­
ment. We might find these true 
liberals among the many distin­
guished exiles in this country and 
England, just as we called upon 
Count Sforza to assist in the recon­
struction of Italy. Some others 
might be in Germany itself—under­
group leaders perhaps, or some few, 
who by force only have consented to 
help Hitler.
This is a tremendous job, and if 
we do not succeed we might as well 
begin to prepare ourselves for a 
third World War.
E. A. L.
dance be equally distributed between the 
A.S.T. unit fund and A.C.A.C.
Motion carried.
NEW BUSINESS
Miss Rial is to draft a letter to the 
Executive Board asking for the week-end 
of March 29 and April 1 in which to have 
Spring Carnival. Mr. Fairchild and Mr. 
Festenstein are to start work on a tenta­
tive budget to cover the expense of the 
affair.
v Mr. Murphy read a letter from Negley 
Reed as member of Interhonorary Coun­
cil, in which he outlined a plan for a 
Freshman Orientations Committee to be 
formed from members of Interhonorary 
Council and other members of honoraries 
on campus.
Mr. Festenstein moved that A.C.A.C. 
delegate Interhonorary Council to handle 
freshman orientation subject to the ap­
proval of the Interhonorary Council.
Motion carried.
Mr. Emerson, representative of Inter­
honorary Council at the A.C.A.C. meet­
ing, was asked to report back to the mem­
bers of Interhonorary Council that fresh­
man orientations had been delegated to 
them and that A.C.A.C. would like a de­
tailed plan of the week of freshman ori­
entations.
Adjournment.
Respectfully submitted,
SALLY BLOOM, 
Secretary.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
one of the boys
This week the Tartan ranged way 
across the expanse of the Pattern 
Shop to discover a few facts about 
the guiding light of the Thistle 
menage — Robert Riddell by name. 
The rumors which have been going 
around about him are quite fright­
ening—most intelligent man in the 
Senior class, Editor of the Thistle, 
President of Tau Beta Pi, President 
of Inter-honorary Council, Presi­
dent of Beta Theta Pi, Vice-Presi­
dent of the YMCA Council, first mail 
on the golf team last year, just a 
plain, ordinary member of Scimitar 
in the days of his sophomore youth, 
a four factor man last semester, and 
practically anything else of im­
portance on campus you can think 
of. After all, the Tartan is only 
fifteen feet away from the yearbook 
office, and Mr. Riddell doesn’t grad­
uate until August. When these dic­
tators get in the groove, you never 
can tell what neutral publication 
they’re likely to blitz. It seems that 
these Westinghouse Scholarship 
boys have been trained in the dem­
ocratic processes, however, and we 
on the news sheet have nothing to 
fear.
Despite the fact that he is a phys­
ics major, Bob is really a charming 
fellow—six foot three, the Wood­
bury Beauty Blend in pants, with 
blue eyes, brown hair, and the
skin-------, “one of the smoothest
men on campus” chosen by one 
of the more charming girls on 
same, but faithful to a charmer 
from Smith (it says here). Must 
be true, though, because he doesn’t
Carnegie Tech Faculty 
Increased by Six Members
This week the Carnegie Tech fac­
ulty has been increased by six new 
members, one of whom is a woman. 
She is Miss Lois Evelyn Kramer, 
who is a part time instructor in the 
Evening School. Miss Kramer re­
ceived her degree at Pennsylvania 
College for Women and took her 
graduate work at the University of 
Minnesota. This year she came back 
to Pittsburgh to teach during the 
day at her Alma Mater, and in the 
evening to teach Introductory Psy­
chology at Carnegie Tech.
Mr. Wallace Wright Carpenter, 
an instructor in Machinery Hall, 
has a Buhl Research fellowship in 
Electrical Engineering. In Engi­
neering Hall we find three 
instructors added to the faculty 
this week. They are Lo-Ching 
Chang, Robert M. Dodds, and Ben­
jamin George Marcin. Lo-Ching 
Chang is here on a fellowship in the 
Metals Research Laboratory. Mr. 
Dodds and Mr. Marcin are instruc­
tors in Civil Engineering. Mr. 
Dodds graduated from Carnegie 
Tech in December 1943. Theta Tau, 
Carnegie Tech’s only professional 
engineering society, chose him as 
the outstanding engineer. The new 
member added to the faculty in In­
dustries Hall is Howard C. Volkin, 
who is an instructor in Mechanics.

date a single chick on campus. Mr. 
Riddlell is, for a genius, not ex­
tremely peculiar. His only vices 
are the operation of “wittle ewectric 
twains,” singing—quote roommate 
“in a stinky voice” — and wear­
ing pajamas while he werks. Our 
guiding light dislikes wet socks in 
bed, Frank Sinatra, and the fact 
that Carnegie students have so lit­
tle influence upon school policy, and 
so little chance to express their 
opinions upon existing conditions 
here. His most exciting moment 
at Carnegie came when he was 
named an Honor Junior by Tau 
Beta Pi, and his most embarrassing 
moments comes every day when he 
forgets the names of his best 
friends. The Peoria, Illinois para­
gon wants to get his master’s de­
gree and later his doctor’s, after he 
leaves this noble institution of 
learning. His plans are a little 
hazy after that, but he intends to 
make good, natcherly. We are 
practically postive that he will.
YMCA Plans Affair 
To Welcome Trainees
As part of a general program 
whereby Carnegie Tech hopes to 
aid incoming trainees in getting ac­
quainted with the campus, the Y. 
M. C. A. is holding open house for 
a group of A. S. T. men on Sunday, 
February 6, at the Carnegie Union. 
According to Professor Boyd Den­
nison of the Electrical Engineering 
Department, who is chairman of 
the affair, entertainment and re­
freshments will be the order of the 
day. Assisting him are Mr. Rollin 
V. Davis, secretary pf the Y. M. C.
A., Edgar A. Starr, Math and His­
tory professor, and Captain Pickrel 
of the A. S. T. P. who is cooperat­
ing with them. The refreshments 
at the reception, to be held from 
one to five, will be served by wives 
of the faculty members and the C. 
W. C. A. cabinet. Professor Robert 
Gregg is in charge of contacting 
the girls.

Term 3 Engineers In 
Farewell Gathering
On Friday evening just before 
furlough time the 200-250 departing 
“term Threes” as well as those re­
maining enjoyed a beer party in 
the mess hall, “Beanery” to the non 
Army members. It was a pick-up 
supper-smoker affair with plenty of 
practically everything.
For supper at six, “Stinkey” 
Davis, “Hal” Cooper and George 
Felf, the pride of “A” Co., sat down 
to heaping plates of potato salad, 
cold cuts, olives, celery and all the 
trimmings. Potato chips and pret­
zels almost reached a peak on the 
top of the plate and intermingled 
were salted peanuts. “Whitey” 
Weiss, “Railroad” Smith, and 
“Smith 41” Doty, “B’s” own, seem­
ed to enjoy particularly the 
pumpkin pie which came out of 
that mysterious place—the kitchen. 
Beer for everyone was the order of 
the day. There were no less than 
50 quarts on hand, and very little 
was allowed to go stale.
“Oiwan” Irwin and John Stepel- 
ton (also of “B”) joined lustilly in 
the singing of such favorites (as the 
Army calls them) as 1) “Glorious, 
One Key, Etc., Etc.,” 2) “She Wore 
It in The Springtime,” 3) Several 
unprintables.
Mrs. Dora Chew, manager of the 
Mess Hall, went far out of her way 
in seeing that everything went off 
well, and helped greatly with all 
those details that usually aren’t 
thought of when the word party is 
mentioned. Mr. Charles Lempers, 
chef extraordinary, was rightfully 
toasted early in the evening for his 
constant flow of toothsome edibles.
These men will travel a wide 
variety of paths from here on. 
Some of them will stay at Tech and 
go into term four. The ones who 
ship out will be roughly divided as 
follows: the greater part will go to 
infantry (excluding the fifty Air 
Cadets who are to begin their Cadet 
training and the eighteen men who 
will study medicine and become 
part of the medics); eighteen others
Rosenbach Appointed 
Member of Committee
Professor Rosenbach has been ap­
pointed to the Measurement Com­
mittee of the Measurement and 
Guidance Project in Engineering 
Education, and the Carnegie Foun­
dation for the Advancement of 
Teaching. One of the important 
objectives of this project is the con­
struction pf a series of objective 
achievement examinations covering 
the initial phases of engineering 
study. The principal topics to be 
considered in these examinations 
are: mathematics, physics, chemis­
try, engineering drawing, descrip­
tive geometry, and English. The 
pre-engineering inventory place­
ment examinations have already 
been completed, and they are to be 
given to either high school seniors, 
or to college freshmen during their 
first week of college. By means of 
these examinations it is hoped that 
the college freshman’s aptitude for 
engineering may be determined. At 
the end of their first year of college, 
the students who have been success­
ful in the pre-engineering examina­
tions will be given achievement ex 
aminations to determine what they 
have learned. These tests are still 
to be made out.
This program will eventually be 
on a national scale. After the war, 
these examinations may serve an 
acute need when returning service­
men apply for advanced standing 
after the war.
Professor Rosenbach attended the 
organization meeting of the Meas­
urement Committee in Chicago on 
January 14, 15, and 16. He is also 
Chairman of the Sub-Committee on 
Mathematics.
will go to an Air Corps Technical 
School in Wisconsin.
As the evening progressed the 
men called for Colonel Pirkey, com­
mandant of the CIT ASTU. Colonel 
Pirkey said that he was very glad 
to have the opportunity to wish the 
men all the luck in the world on 
their new assignment. Lt. Lister, 
commanding officer of Company A 
said simply, effectively, “Give ’em 
hell.”

4THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1944
Faculty Members Visit 
G.I. Reception Center
Last week Mr. Murphy, Profes­
sor Daniels, Mr. Elliott, and Mr. 
Wangeman visited the new replace­
ment-center at New Cumberland, 
Pa. in order to discover the proced­
ure that a selectee has to go through 
upon reporting to an Army replace­
ment center.
When the selectee arrives at the 
camp, he is sent to a Checking sta­
tion where he is registered and as­
signed to a receiving company. The 
rest off the day is his, that is, what’s 
left of it. The following day clothes 
are issued, special care being taken 
in the shoe and sock measurements. 
Each soldier is given a box in which 
to place his civilian clothes for ship­
ment home. After receiving his 
clothes, the selectee is given the 
Army General Intelligence Test, the 
Mechanics Test, and the Radio Op­
erators Test. If he makes a high 
mark and is in good physical con­
dition, he is also given the Army 
Air Corps Test. He then goes to an 
interviewing office where the rec­
ord card, which follows him 
throughout his Army career, is 
made out. The interviewer places 
the emphasis on actual working ex­
perience rather than education. The 
selectee is then passed on to the 
classification officer, who places him 
in the position in which the Army 
can best use him.
The next day every selectee re­
ceives those well-known Army 
shots, and as a chaser the boys get 
a little exercise. If, by this time, 
anyone is found who is illiterate, he 
is sent to a school where he is given 
training that will bring him up to 
fourth grade level.
Anyone who is interested in a 
more detailed account of what goes 
on at a replacement center should 
see Mr. Murphy, Professor Daniels, 
Mr. Elliot, or Mr. Wangeman.
Dr. Jones Appointed 
Engineering Director
Dr. Webster N. Jones, director of 
the College of Engineering, was in­
stalled as President of the Engi­
neers’ Society of Western Pennsyl­
vania on Friday, January 14, at a 
reception and dinner in the William 
Penn Hotel. Director Jones has 
been an active member of this so­
ciety for twelve years. During this 
period, he has also held the posi­
tion of first vice president.
The Engineers’ Society of West­
ern Pennsylvania was founded 
sixty-two years ago. It is compos­
ed of all engineering societies in 
this district. The main objective 
of the society is to promote the 
welfare of engineers.

by for a week. For the first time 
in three months it will be possible 
to gaze down the length of a corri­
dor without beholding a single G. I. 
form striding along. Many class­
rooms will be deserted for the same 
period of time. Professors, soldiers, 
Carnegie itself, will enjoy this fur­

and new breath for the rather grim 
task of war education.
Several last-night-on-campus fea­
tures marked fitting beginnings for 
the week. The third term engineers 
celebrated with their own get-to­
gether in the Mess Hall. The re­
mainder of the unit drifted about 
the city, many dropping in for a 
time at least, on the March of Dimes 
dance. Some few simply relaxed. 
By now, it is safe to say, very few 
will be indulging in the latter form 
of amusement.

Pittsburgh Has Smog; 
What Can Compare?
By Al Perry
Hair, it has been said, is woman’s 
crowning glory. In the same way 
smog is Pittsburgh’s. Few other 
cities can boast of personalities in 
their days and nights—personalities 
that make you know a day as you 
know your room mate, or a night as 
you know your best beau. The smog 
is directly responsible for this per­
sonality. To be sure, other cities 
have nights like those rare ones 
here when the sky is liquid sap­
phire on jet, studded with dia­
monds (five-fifty extra with gen­
tleman’s solitaire to match), but 
soft, cool air and diffused moonlight 
lack of character until they are com­
pared to the rugged mystery of lu- 
miniscent smog.
Everyone has lain on his back on 
the grass and admired the stars and 
moon (and best beau), but only a 
Pittsburgher knows what it is to 
walk through endless miles of pul­
sating ectoplasm, softly glowing 
with a half-life drawn from the life 
of the city itself. You may normally 
pass people on the street without 
noticing them, but never in the 
smog. Either they do not appear, or 
they glide through the mist like 
phantoms, becoming alive as they 
pass and fading again into limbo. 
Sound takes over for sight, and the 
entire balance of the senses is upset. 
Nor is this unusual sensation the 
only desirable feature of our living 
nights.
Walking in the smog produces 
another sensation, that of being 
small and alone in a tiny known 
world with a great unknown world 
extending in all directions. This 
feeling is present especially when no 
more than two are walking togeth­
er. With a friend, any feeling of 
companionship is strengthened by 
the illusion of being grouped togeth­
er in a zone of light surrounded by 
semi-darkness. Conversation will 
automatically be intimate; the 
matching of the people will govern 
its being philosophical or psycholog­
ical. A pair in the smog usually 
get along all right, so we will leave 
them to their seclusion and their 
thoughts.
But what about the lone wander­
er in the semi-solid atmosphere? He 
is sure to become thoughtful, re­
flecting the pensive mood of the 
smog. The enormity of the unkown 
forces itself into his consciousness, 
bringing out the questions which 
amount to something. A complete­
ly insensitive person might worry 
about the blond at the dance last 
night, but it is an exceptional per­
son who does not consider things 
outside himself. The smog is organic 
in more ways than being a carbon 
compound. It reflects the life in and 
around it, and influences the life it 
shrouds. The smog is no handicap, it 
is an inspiring feature of the en­
vironment for those who respond to 
its personality.

of certification; and
(c) By the National Roster that 
the certification of the institute is 
correct to the best of its knowledge 
and belief and that his deferment, 
if granted, will be within the na­
tional quota for such students.
E. Determination and Certifica­
tion of Quotas: 
1. Student quota.
A national quota of 10,000 has 
been established for students who 
should be occupationally deferred 
at any one time by reason of pursu­
ing courses of study in chemistry, 
engineering, geology, geophysics, 
and physics. Students deferred to 
graduate on or before July 1, 1944, 
and students deferred for reasons 
other than pursuing a course of 
study will not be counted against 
this quota.
3. Function of the National Ros­
ter. The National Roster of Scien­
tific and Specialized Personnel of 
the Man Power Commission will 
certify to requests for occupational 
deferment of students under this 
bulletin as follows:
Request for occupational defer­
ment of a registrant in chemistry, 
engineering, geology, geophysics, or 
physics will be prepared by the in­
stitution in which the registrant is 
a student and will be forwarded to 
the National Roster. The National 
Roster will, if such is the case, cer­
tify on the request that the state­
ments of the institution as to the 
course of study and competence 
and prospective date of completion 
of the registrant are correct to the 
best of its knowledge and belief, and 
that the registrant’s deferment, if 
granted, will not exceed the quota 
established for such students.
If the National Roster cannot 
truthfully make such certification, 
it will not certify the request. The 
National Roster will return the re­
quest for occupational deferment, 
whether certified or not, to the in­
stitution which prepared the re­
quest.”
ACAC Dance Proves 
Very Successful Venture
The ACAC dance on Friday night 
in the Gym reminded every one of 
the dances in the distant past. There 
seemed to be no shortage of men, 
in fact many of the soldiers left for 
lack of dancing partners. The gath­
ering was a huge success with the 
celebrants giving an amount ex­
pected to exceed $300.00 to the In­
fantile Paralysis Fund. Billy Le- 
Roy furnished music sweet and low, 
and refreshments were served both 
by the regular Army committee and 
by the Salvation Army Canteen 
which turned up at the last minute. 
Never before have dancers had so 
much food to gorge themselves 
upon — coke and cookies by the 
Army and sandwiches, coffee, and 
doughnuts from the Salvation 
Army. All the most popular tunes 
were played including Shoo-Shoo, 
Baby; Star Eyes; and My Ideal. 
Everyone expresses joy at the fact 
that most of the numbers were slow 
and dreamy rather than jivey.
Several medleys of waltzes were 
also appreciated by the dancers. Col­
onel Pirkey and Captain Pickrel 
kept the traditional hawk eye train­
ed upon the behavior of the AST’s 
and Dean Yon and Mr. Murphy 
made sure that the civilians were 
good children.

TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 1944THE CARNEGIE TARTAN5SPORTS
Y
OLDIER 
PORT 
LANTS
Recently much censure and crit­
icism had been heaped upon our 
heads because we have not sung 
the praises of the regimental team. 
Many people have approached us 
and have asked why we haven’t 
written a column about the team. 
We had always thought that every­
body here at Tech knew of the 
quality and the calibre of the team, 
that to tout the team would be try­
ing to drive home a point that had 
already been driven home. We 
thought it would be unnecessary to 
say a word about the quintet. We 
find, however, that we were wrong. 
Notwithstanding the fact that the 
story has been told countless times 
before, we repeat it by request.
The team is, without doubt, a 
very, very fine team. One might be 
so bold as to say that it is one of 
the best in the Pittsburgh area— 
yes, in the East. It is possible by 
circuitous means to establish the 
fact that the regimental team has, 
or can, (theoretically) beat most of 
the teams in the East.
There is good reason for the 
quality ©f the team. It is composed 
of the best basketball material in 
the A S T P personnel at Carnegie. 
The combination is good and so 
smooth that at times it seems ruth­
less in the way it mows down its 
opponents. We are indeed proud 
of the Carnegie Tech A S T P Reg­
imental Basketball Team.

Regimental Five Beats 
Ambridge & Pitt Dents
As Gaza goes, so goes the team. 
Against the Ambridge Tech Stars, 
an independent five, the Hoosier 
Hotshot swished 27 markers 
through the nets. All of which was 
enough inspiration for the team to 
forge ‘out a 61-43 win Wednesday
The game was marked by the re­
turn of Hank Holets, ex-Skibo floor 
and gridron star. Hank has kept 
his shooting eye, as his 14 point to­
tal proves. Gaza led the scoring 
parade wit-h 27 counters. Evans of 
the Army followed the leaders with 
10 points. The visitors, who were 
definitely no pushover, featured 
Holets, “Sparky” Adams, ex-Du- 
quesne floorman, and Milanovich, 
from Geneva.
The first quarter was fairly slow. 
Gaza picked up 8 points to start the 
evening’s merriment, but Holets 
dropped in a brace of buckets to 
close up the gap.
The second period found 
the Army fast-break functioning 
smoothly, with Gaza slipping in 3 
buckets, matched by Evans with 3 
more.
The G. I. Floormen ran their total 
up to 36 before the visitors scored 
again in the second half. Ambridge 
recovered with 5 field goals, but 
the Army still had a comfortable
12-point margin as the third period 
ended.
Gaza gave a preview of the final 
period by flipping in 2 quickers. To­
gether with 8 more points, he finish­
ed out his string of 27.
Tartans Fight Hard, 
But Fail To Conquer 
Pitt and West Virginia
Last week the basketball team 
played host to West Virginia and 
Pitt, and dropped both games be­
fore capacity crowds. The Tartans 
started out like a house on fire 
against the taller Mountaineers, 
piling up a 17-7 lead in the early 
stages of the game. Eventually the 
West Virginian’s who were being 
outclassed switched to a zone de­
fense. At the same time their shots 
began to hit the mark. By half time, 
the Mountaineers had overcome the 
early Tartan lead and pulled out in 
front by six points to lead 29-23. 
The Tartans fought desperately in 
the final quarter, but were unable 
to overtake the Mountaineer lead. 
The final score, West Virginia 50— 
Carnegie 45.
After watching the West Virginia 
game, Dr. Carlson, Pitt coach, ap­
parently came to the conclusion 
that it would be best for the Pan­
thers to get off to a safe lead as soon 
as possible. Very soon after the 
opening whistle, Pitt jumped to an 
eight point lead, but it was finally 
whittled away late in the second 
period when Kelly’s field goal put 
Carnegie ahead 19-18. From this 
point until the final quarter, • Car­
negie was very much in the game; 
but the final period was a runaway 
for Pitt. The final, score, Pitt 52— 
Carnegie 33. ,
Special credit goes to Joe Kelly, 
who was high scorer for Carnegie 
in both games.
THE GRANDSTAND
By Walt Ellman, Sports Editor 
Goodbye, Howdy!
Saturday night’s battle with Pitt marked the end of the brief but bril­
liant college career of Howard Levy, stalwart forward of this year’s Skibo 
passers. Howdy has made himself conspicuous all season by his deadly 
accuracy from all angles of the court and by his fighting, rushing tactics 
which have broken up many enemy forays. He graduated last May from 
Peabody High School where he was captain of the basketball team. Howdy 
leaves for the Army Air Corps this week and goes with all the best wishes 
of his many friends on campus. Good luck, Howdy! The air corps is get­
ting a swell guy as well as a great basketball player.
Star Athlete Missing
Word has been received that Lt. Walter “Whitey” Loos, former Tech 
athlete, has been lost in action in the Atlantic ocean while serving with 
the Army Air Corps. While at school, “Whitey” won a reputation as one of 
the greatest Tartan athletes of modern times. He was a three letter man 
in basketball, a star in track, and a member of the football team. He gradu­
ated in 1939 after having played on the Eastern Intercollegiate Basketball 
championship team of 1938-39. “Whitey’s” best sport, however, was base­
ball. He was a catcher on numerous sandlot squads in his high school and 
college days and then went on to play minor league baseball. “Whitey” 
was on the threshold of a major league career with the Cincinnati Reds 
when the war came, and like so many athletes, he went to play in the 
biggest game of them all. We only hope that “Whitey” will return once 
more to star in contests of lesser importance.
Why So Quiet, Doc?
The basketball game with Pitt was not devoid of the usual sidelights 
which everyone expects when these two old rivals meet. “The perennial 
Battle of the Coaches,” however, failed to materialize. It is practically a 
custom for Max Hannum and Dr. “Red” Carlson of Pitt to steal the show. 
Max made it all one-sided when he jumped on Referee Moon Klinzing’s 
neck to protest a foul in the second quarter and promptly was assessed 
with a technical foul for his pains. Carlson then jumped up off his bench 
and it looked as if the much heralded battle might ensue but the good 
doctor must be getting old for he sat right down again. Chalk one up for 
our side.
Question of the Week
What ever became of intramural bowling??????
Co. D Wins Basketball Crown 
By Defeating Co. B, 48 to 26
Captain Cooper’s troopers, the 
hoopsters from D Company, clinch­
ed the basketball title on Thursday 
night by trouncing B company, 48- 
26. It is hard to pick out £ny stars 
for the ROTC boys—they gave a 
beautiful exhibition of team work. 
In all fairness to the B company 
quintet, who fought hard all the 
way, it should be mentioned that 
two of their regular performers 
were missing.
Company D, in winning this 
game, clinched the league cham­
pionship. Until this game, D had 
lost but one contest, while Company 
E had lost two. A loss by Company 
D would have resulted in a two-way 
tie for first place. Realizing their 
position, Company D fought hard 
and won.
There was plenty of good basket­
ball on display throughout the 
contest. B jumped out with a two 
point lead, t?ut D tied and passed 
them in a htxry. Both teams em­
ployed the 1 ist break a great deal 
and the acti< i was fast and furious. 
At half time, D company had a com­
fortable 11-point lead. For a short 
time in the second half, when Cul­
bertson whipped in 7 straight 
markers, the contest turned into a 
rout. But B came back, and fought 
down to the final whistle. Un­
doubtedly the lack of reserves hurt 
their cause a great deal.
For company D, every man turn­
ed in a great performance: Benko 
displayed his usual ball-handling 
ability, Alderdice made his usual 
one-handers, Purtell and Purcell 
played beautiful defensive games, 
breaking up countless fast breaks 
by the opponents, and Culbertson 
had a good night. Stock and Har­
ris looked good as reserves.
Friday night the team took on 
the Pitt Dental Five and beat them 
51-26. Gaza was able to rack up 
only 15 points, because he was forc­
ed out on fouls before the finish of 
the first half. O’Brien, of Tech, was 
next best with 14 points. Rokoski 
sparked the visiting five by gar- 
nuering 10 points.

6THE CARNEGIE TARTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 1, 19443Ttie dTarue^ie plaid
J. Rymar Current 
Council Secretary
We’re sure you won’t have any 
difficulty in recognizing this hand­
some chap. Joseph M. Rymar, Sec­
retary of Council, is this year’s 
President of the College of Engi-
’v' ' ‘ ^ /j.. „ . *
»111
neering as well as News Editor of 
the Plaid.
After graduation from Turtle 
Creek Union High in 1935, Joe took 
a course at Westinghouse Technical 
Night School and then in 1937 en­
tered Tech as a Mechanical Engi­
neer.
Joe could, excuse me, does, make 
a model husband—he’s good look­
ing (ask any girl on the campus), 
dances like a dream and is a gen­
tleman in every respect of the 
word. An evening school affair just 
wouldn’t be complete without Joe 
and Evelyn (Mrs. Rymar).
For the past four years he has 
been employed at the Westinghouse 
Electric & Mfg. Company.
Things to Think About
In a recent issue of The Carnegie 
Tartan, the enrollment figures for 
the second semester were given in 
round numbers as 500 for all the 
evening classes on the campus. 
While the trend of registration re­
cently has been downward, it was 
not expected to reach such a low 
point, and this figure is bound to 
produce a shock, especially when 
a few years ago the students attend­
ing evening classes were represent­
ed by four figures.
What are the causes for this drop­
ping off? What is the significance 
of the slump? What can be done to 
prevent further decline, and what 
action can be taken to rebuild the 
registration to bring Carnegie even­
ing classes back to the point where 
they once were? They served this 
district well and were a potential 
factor in the educational field.
If an educational institution is to 
function and render service, that of 
dispensing instruction in a regular 
and formal manner, it is a foregone 
conclusion that there must be stu­
dents enrolled on the receiving end 
to participate in this instruction, 
else why have an institution of 
learning? So, the four questions 
here presented become of major im­
portance and should provoke real 
honest thought in an endeavor for 
solutions. Think these over.
The Editor Edits
I wonder how many of you won­
der what the editor wonders when 
he wonders about what you wonder 
when you read the Plaid each week. 
Well, both you and I were wonder­
ing about the same thing last week, 
namely: just what kind of a paper 
is the Plaid turning out to be? Each 
week the staff strives a little harder 
to give you the best paper of its 
kind in the land, and last week we 
thought we hit a pretty high note, 
but, alas, the Tartan staff dispelled 
our thoughts. The truth of the mat­
ter is: when the baby (paper) was 
put to bed on Friday evening, Janu­
ary 21, it contained seven articles, a 
picture of Mr. A. M. Cox, and three 
small ads.
But on Tuesday, January 25, the 
paper came out stripped of two ar­
ticles completely and another par­
tially, while the Cox picture was 
entirely missing. Instead was plac­
ed a tremendously large coca cola 
ad along with the three original ads. 
It seems, according to the Tartan, 
that the coca cola ad was forgotten 
until the last minute, so the Plaid 
had to suffer the consequences. All 
of us know that a thing like this can 
happen, and emergencies have to be 
met, but why can’t we be notified of 
a change so that we can use our own 
discretion in the elimination of ar­
ticles. After all, Evening Student 
Council pays for the use of the last 
page, and certainly has a right to 
say how the page should be run.
The crux of the whole matter is 
that the Tartan ran a serial of two

Letter to the Editor
Last semester, I read an article 
in the Plaid concerning insignia 
awards. As the eligibility of office 
rules now stands, a student must 
have earned an insignia award to 
be eligible for election to student 
council.
Supposing the award system were 
to be rescinded, would the student 
then running for office be interested 
in the affairs of the student body or 
merely seeking a title? It would 
be hard to tell. With the insignia 
plan, the students can be reason­
ably sure that council members will 
be capable persons with an interest 
in the welfare of the student body. 
This is my opinion—but why not 
canvass all of the students and find 
out just how they feel about it?

Snippy the Snooper is here again, 
folks . . . Did you notice the eye­
catching, breath-taking posters on 
the bulletin boards throughout the 
halls and on the campus? They are 
the brainstorms of the publicity 
committee meeting which was held 
on Wednesday the 26th. Flanders 
dropped in at the opportune time 
and, believe it or not, was seen 
leaving the building with three 
hunks of beauty. By the way, folks, 
the next meeting will be held same 
time, 8:15, same station, Pattern 
Shop, on Thursday, February 3rd. 
New workers welcome . . . Inci­
dentally, if the paper is late this 
week, blame it on Bill Kuskie! He 
kept everybody back from their 
work by his moron jokes. Never 
laughed so long and so hard in my 
life ... I think the Evening School 
girls deserve a pat on the back. 
Have seen quite a few of them en­
tertaining the soldiers at Tech’s 
new canteen! Good spirit, girls! 
That’s evidence that Tech spirit as 
well as a patriotic spirit prevails 
among our petite mam’selles . . . 
Oh yes! I almost forgot to men­
tion that there have been two ad­
ditions to the Harmony II class 
. . . two handsome gents who can 
fire back answers quicker than the 
prof can shoot them.
. . . Valentine Party . . .
Want to have just lots of fun?
Want to put those “blues” on the run? 
Then heed what I am going to say,
And you will never rue the day!
St. Valentine was a jolly scout 
Who believed in happy times, no doubt. 
His birthday comes in February 
So we will make it very merry.
On the 12th of the month, you will see 
A party for him, her, you and me,
Just come to the Hall of Recreation 
It’s Margaret Morrison’s—please hasten.
There’ll be ping-pong for the energetic, 
Records and Dancing for the athletic. 
Then just to wind up with a treat— 
Refreshments that can never be beat.
Now who could ask for anything more’ 
See you there? O.K.—step in the door, 
Drop your cares for a free evening of fun, 
You’ll never regret it—daughter or son.

Council Minutes
The meeting held Sunday, Janu­
ary 9, 1944 was called to order by 
President Flanders and all the 
members were present except Miss 
Crum and Mr. Biscup.
After the reading of the minutes 
of December 5, 1943 meeting, Mr. 
Flanders requested that the Budget 
Committee meet with him January
21, 1944.
Mr. Riffle brought up for discus­
sion the question as to whether the 
Representatives to Council should 
have voting power. After a brief 
discussion Mr. Macha made a mo­
tion, effective immediately, that the 
Student Council Representative who 
lacks an Insignia Award be granted 
the voting power of the regular 
Council member. The essential dif­
ference between a Council Repré­
sentative and a Council member 
will then be that the Representa­
tive will not be eligible to hold 
Council office. The motion was 
seconded and approved by Council.
The Auditing Committee reported 
that the Treasurer’s book was in or­
der. A preliminary report stated 
that the final balance for the 1941- 
1942 term was a deficit of $87.19 and 
the final balance for the 1942-43 
term was an asset of $72.85. A de­
tailed report relative to current 
financial status will be presented at 
the next meeting on February 6,
1944.
The final budget reports on the 
Christmas Supper Dance and the 
Thanksgiving Dance were present­
ed by Mr. Riffle. Meeting adjourn­
ed.
