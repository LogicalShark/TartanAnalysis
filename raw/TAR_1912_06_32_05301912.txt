THE WHITE FRIARS.
On the evening of June the third 
the White Friars will produce at the 
Duquesne Theatre “His Highness, 
the Chef.’ Those who have seen in 
the past a White Friar performance 
need only to be told that this year’s 
show will surpass, in finish and work­
manship, any of the previous produc­
tions to be filled with a desire to se­
cure the best seats possible and at­
tend. There are many, however, who 
have not had the honor of attending 
any of these gala events and we cor­
dially urge them to take advantage of 
the evening of the third of June and 
do so. Much pleasure and entertain­
ment will they derive therefrom and, 
in supporting the organization by at­
tendance at its performance, they will 
be doing a good work. No student 
organization can live long without 
the support of the student-body and 
this is particularily true of the Friars. 
We sincerely trust, therefore, that the 
students will be present at the Du- 
¦quesne theatre on the evening of June 
the third in numbers sufficient to 
guarantee the perpetuation of the 
'White Friars organization and its ac­
tivities in the years to come.
BOARD OF CONTROL ENTER­
TAINED.
Dr. W. L. Savage, supervisor of 
the Department of Student Health, 
«entertained the members of the Board 
of Control of the Athletic Association 
.at his home last Wednesday evening. 
During the very enjoyable social time, 
the doctor was willing to talk shop 
with the student representatives, giv­
ing them a good idea of the new elig­
ibility code now being drawn up for 
the use of the colleges of Western 
Pennsylvania and West Virginia, un­
der a new intercollegiate association.
Dr. Savage was appointed to deter­
mine the sentiment of all the colleges 
in this district in regard to eligibility 
rules, and, with their suggestions as 
a basis, a new code will be drafted 
and presented for adoption to the 
various institutions.

INTERCOLLEGIATE TENNIS 
TOURAMENT.
Carengie Tech was the host of five 
other colleges during last week, the 
occasion being the annual tournament 
of the Intercollegiate Tennis Associa­
tion. The games were played on the 
University Club courts on Tuesday 
Wednesday and Thursday.
The first day’s contests gave those 
interested a close idea as to the rela­
tive merits of the teams, and satisfied 
all of the contestants that the meet 
would be hard fought. Dabzell and 
Brownell, Allegheny’s crack double 
team, won two matches on the first 
day, winning from Hanna and Archer, 
of Grove City, 6-0, 6-3, and from Rick- 
ett and Graf, of W. and J., 6-1, 6-1. 
The Grove City team defeated Cum­
mings and McNaugher, of .Wesmins- 
ter, 6-4, 6-4. The latter team was 
taken into camp by our players, Beek- 
en and Douthett, in two sets, 6-3, 6-3. 
The first results of the Class A singles 
gave Pitt a lead. Mackrell won two 
matches in the first afternoon, beat­
ing Mates, of Allegheny, 6-4, 7-5, and 
winning from Archer, of Grove City, 
6-2, 6-2. Capt. Flood, of our team, 
also beat Archer, the scores standing 
6-3, 6-4. Watt, of Westminster, lost 
to Moore, of W. and J., 6-1, 6-3. In 
the Class B singles, Bright, of Alle­
gheny defeated Grant, of Grove City,
9-7, 6-3. Wright, of /Pitt, also won 
from Grant, 6-0, 6-0/ Savage started 
a good record by ^beating Kistler, of 
Westminster, fy-2( 6-4. Hamilton, of 
W. and J., defeated Kistler, 6-3, 6-0
Good weather continued through 
the tournamfent and play was run off 
fast. Each team played each of the 
others in the three classes, forty-five 
matches being played. A number ran 
three sets each before the winner was 
decided. /
Allegheny’s double team continued 
winning* their hardest match being 
with Wilbert and Ebe, of Pitt, which 
ended 5-7, 6-4, 14-12. Westminster 
and Tech were each beaten by scores 
of 6-2, 6-2. Hanna and Archer, of 
Grove City, had difficulty in beating 
our team, the score reading 6-3, 8-6, 
6-3. The Pitt team also went to de­
feat at the same hands, 3-6, 6-3, 6-3. 
Douthett and Beeken won from W. 
and J., 6-1, 6-2, and fr»m Pitt by de­
fault.
Flood and Mackrell each won four

THE PEMBERTON CUP.
Given to Ithaca Branch of Telluride 
Association.
Several colleges and other institu­
tions of learning have begun to realize 
the importance of public speaking and 
debating, but unfortunately many en­
gineering schools have been slow in 
emphasizing the necessity of courses 
of that character. Many prominent 
men today maintain that the average 
young American engineer is not suf-5 
ficiently able to stand up and set forth 
his ideas adequately.
Many efforts have been^ made to 
remedy this condition, and we are 
gratified to know that one of themy
THURSDAY MORNING 
LECTURE.
Two weeks ago today, one of the 
most interesting of the Thursday 
morning lectures was given by Brof. 
C. N. A. Veditz, of George Wahlffeg- 
ton University and a member of the 
Tariff Board. He spoke upon “The 
Tariff Question.”
He proved to be one of the best, 
most interesting and most humorous 
speakers of the year.
is directly emanating from Carnegie 
Tech. A permanent prize cup has 
béen donated to the Ithica Branch of 
the famous Telluride Association by 
Prof. A. J. Wurts; head of the De­
partment of Ele'ctrical Engineering, 
for the purpose of promoting the art 
of public speaking and technical dis­
cussion among the engineers of that 
association. The cup has been named 
Pemberton Cup, in memory of his 
father, Charles Pemberton Wurts. The 
accompanying cut, for which the Tar 
tan is indebted to Prof. Wurts, shows 
the general appearance and style of 
the cup, which may be pronounced a 
veritable work of art.
The Pemberton Cup was designed, 
cast and finished at C. I. T. A prize 
was offered by Prof. Wurts for the
best design, and was won by Miss 
Eleanor Wood Tener, of the School 
of Applied Design. The construction 
of the cup was supervised by Mr. 
Zeller, and it was cast by Mr. Dosey. 
Much credit is due to the men who 
have so successfully finished the dif­
ficult task.
The cup is made of standard bronze 
and the style is Pempeiian. The square 
pedestal is 12 inches high, the bowl 
isysix inches high and twelve inches 
in diameter.. On one of the panels the 
following words are engarved:
Pemberton Cup 
Donated by .Prof. A. J. Wurtz 
MCMXII 
To the Ithaca Branch 
Telluride Association.
surrounded by a wreath of bay leaves. 
On the other panels are represented 
the winged torch of science, the ser­
pent of wisdom and the sword of 
justice entwined with the olive branch 
of peace. The clawed feet on which 
the pedestal rests are emblematic of 
tenacity in the pursuit of knowledge. 
The four upper corners of the ped­
estal are formed by portrait heads of 
Socrates, Sophocles, Plato and Aes- 
chiles in bold relief. The bowl is 
decorated by scenes from the Athens 
gardens, Athenian portraits, etc. This 
decoration is emblematic of the pur­
pose of the cup, for, in Athens most 
disputes and differences were settled 
by debate. In the garden scenes 
judges, debaters, poets, etc., are de­
picted.
The Pemberton Cup is essentially 
a permanent prize, and as such it will 
doubtless bring better results than it 
would if it were intended for one oc­
casion only. It is to be kept one year 
by each successive winner and space 
is reserved on the cup for the inscrip­
tion of the names of the winners, to 
the numhter of fifty.

The Editorial Board of The Tartan 
desires to here congratulate the alum­
ni upon their issue, published last 
week. The Tartan Committee of the 
Association is to be commended upon 
its energy in getting together and 
editing the material for the issue and 
it is to be hoped by all that the Alum­
ni Association will see fit to follow 
in succeeding years the precedent 
thus established.
—o—
Pitt won her meet on Saturday last 
and we trust that she now feels satis­
fied. Personally we do not care to 
see Carnegie teams win by such means 
but we suppose that to be meerly a 
piece of old-fashionedness upon our 
part. We can not all acquire the 
progressive spirit of “winning games” 
with the same degree of rapidity. We 
trust our athletic authorities will take 
advantage of this object lesson fur­
nished to us so gratitously and with 
such a spirit of unselfish helpfulness.
There is another side to the matter, 
however, which strikes us as the more 
important one while it is the one 
least commented upon. Judging from 
the ruling made one might gather, if 
unacquainted with the true circum­
stances, that the quality of the work 
done in our calss rooms was inferior 
to that done in those of other institu­
tions whose teams appeared in the 
meet. To those who know the truth, 
the absurdity of such a supposition 
is at once evident. We care particu­
larly for the being barred out of a 
meet conceded to us had we entered, 
but we do care about the attempted 
slap at our collegiate work, which 
we, here at Carnegie, put upon a 
higher plane than the work of the 
football, track, or any other athletic 
team.
ALL OUT FOR FOOTBALL.
Manager “Bill” Finkel has started 
plans for the early training of next 
year’s football squad and in issuing 
a preliminary call. Following the 
plans of last year’s team, arrange­
ment are being made for the use of 
Camp Louise Carnegie during the 
early weeks of September preceding 
the opening of school. In view of the 
trouble which will be necessary for 
the maintenance of the camp, it is im­
perative that a large squad report for 
training. Hence this early call.
Tents will be provided and a com­
petent chef will have charge of the 
training table. Light practice will be 
followed with a view of hardening the 
men gradually and having them in 
good condition before the 
regular training season. This will 
take up but a part of the daylight 
hours and the situation of the camp 
makes agreeable recreation easily 
found. Over a mile of river front 
provides excellent opportunity of all 
kinds of water sports, while the ex­
tensive area will allow any amount of 
exploration or of resting next to Na­
ture. Coaches Ramsdell and McCul- 
lock, Dr. Marks and Capt. Crawford 
will be in charge of the men, and they 
have proved themselves able to lead 
in all kinds of innocent amusements.
A request is given for the names 
and addresses of such candidates for 
the team as can spend two or three 
weeks “on the farm.” Only those 
who intend to try for the team need 
send in their names. Full particulars 
will be mailed to the individual appli­
cants as soon as the arrangements 
have been completed. Drop the slips 
in the Science Tartan box or hand to 
Manager Finkel before the end of 
next week, then come out and swell 
the squad.

CARNEGIE INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY : : :
T
HE Carnegie Institute of Technology consists of four 
separate schools, each with its own faculty, buildings 
and student body. The courses of instruction 
offered in these four schools differ widely.
School of Applied Science—Offers courses in chemical, 
civil, electrical, commercial, mechanical, metallurgical, 
mining and sanitary engineering.
School of Applied Design—Offers courses in architecture, 
interior decoration, illustration and painting, open to both 
men and women.
School of Applied Industries—Offers industrial courses in 
machine construction, building construction, and elec­
trical equipment and installation. Short courses are offered 
in the various trades for applicants with experience. A 
new course to equip men as teachers in manual training 
and in trade school work is also offered. The increasing 
demand for such men provides an attractive field for the 
progressive young mechanic and the public school teacher
Margaret Morrison Carnegie School—For women only. 
Offers courses in household economics, secretarial work, 
dressmaking, and costume illustration and design. Be­
cause of the demand for trained teachers, graduate courses 
are offered for those who wish to prepare for the many 
positions now open for women in these newer lines of work.
Night Courses—The four schools offer night courses in 
practically all of the above subjects to provide educational 
opportunities for those who are at work during the day.

straight matches in the Class A. sin­
gles, then in the final match of the 
meet, battled for honors. The three 
sets played offered a spectacle of 
some of the best tennis seen in local 
amateur contests. Mackrell played 
just a bit more consistently and won,
6-3, 5-7, 6-4.
Wright and Savage fought for first 
honors in Class B, each defeating his 
other opponents before the final 
match. Here again the battle was 
close, but Wright won 4-6, 6-2, 6-3.
Allegheny won the doubles champ­
ionship, and Pitt the Class A and 
Class B singles title. Grove City was 
the runner up in the doubles, and 
Carnegie Tech in both classes of the 
singles. The tournament was won by 
Pitt, while our team was the closest 
to the winners.

THE TARTAN
‘WHAT'S WHAT AND HOW.”
There is a popular superstition that 
baseball is our national game. It is 
not; politics occupy that point of dis­
tinction. Between the two, however, 
there are points of similarity. Both 
have been a pronounced librarian 
brogue and in both cases the public 
plays the inconspicuous role of audi­
ence and gives up its good money, 
either to be transformed into a mob 
of blittering, bellowing maniacs or in 
the political game to have their assets 
removed without pain.
No college is complete without a 
full set of political machinery.
To the undergraduate all this fuss 
and fury about governors and presi­
dents is a pale and anaemic travesty 
of the vital questions as to who shall 
direct the august fortunes of the foot­
ball team, the baseball team, the track 
team, the ‘‘fussing” team, etc.
The paternal tongue may grow 
fussy over what its owner regards as 
his exercise of the franchise, but 
which is really a cunning little trick 
that his political boss has taught him, 
for his own private amusement, that 
concerns not the hopeful son exposed 
to the dangers of an education. He 
at least is a free man, with a fighting 
chance to elect officials who will rep­
resent him or who will need numer­
ous repairs.
He also has connections and states 
them in language that leaves a dark 
brown taste in the consciousness of its 
victim. He is convinced, for instance, 
that all the virtues that a male person 
has any right to possess belong in 
fee simple to the members of his own 
organization and that all the name­
less vices that should be the exclu­
sive property of the Faculty skulk 
about the mental premises of rival 
organizations. He will rise in the 
stilly watches of the night and ex­
pend three arduous hours in eliminet- 
ing one vote together with the un­
happy individual that thinks he pos­
sesses that vote, so that his own can­
didate for the immortal distinction of 
class-sergeant-at-arms shall be tri­
umphantly elected.
And the next day, with an inner 
consciousness of having saved the 
c untry that makes his faff to shine 
like an application of laundry soap, 
he will flunk his English with joy un­
speakable.
He will start a riot anytime and 
make mush out of the schedule to 
prevent the tragedy of a successful 
campaign by the rival candidate for 
class goat.
He has a secret service department 
for which even the great and good 
government of the Tzar need not 
blush and from which the careful se­
questered secrets of the Faculty are 
not hid.
He cares as little for the sordid 
equations of life whose solution is re­
quired in terms of bread and butter, 
as he does for the artless algebraic 
fictions concerning the fantastic nu­
merical adventures of Messrs. A., G.,
C., et. al.
He is an idealist, yes, but his con­
victions are most real and he stands 
ready to reduce any or all articles 
of civilized attire to their original
elements in defense of them at any 
time.
He is the only genuine white hope 
in this land of the low-browed, bal- 
loon-bellied boss and of the mephitic 
grafter.

WIRELESS.
On Saturday, May 18th, the finish­
ing touches were added to the an­
tenna on the Applied Industries Build­
ing, and the club members have since 
then been enjoying the use of a fully 
equipped wireless station.
On Saturday evening the first dis­
tance messages were received, and 
much to the satisfaction of the mem­
bers the apparatus proved its worth.
Messages from stations at as great 
a distance as 1,100 miles were re­
ceived and a great many at a smaller 
distance.
Key West, Fla., was heard talking 
with Norfolk, Va., and Cape Cod was 
heard as clear as a bell. Cape Cod 
is the station that sends news to the 
ocean liners; it uses a machine for 
sending its messages. The stations 
at Chicago, Cleveland and Detroit 
were also heard transacting their reg­
ular routine of business. Operators 
in this vicinity claim that messages 
from C. I. T. come in stronger than 
any others, which speaks well for 
the apparatus.
Membership of the Wireless Club 
is open to all C. I. T. students. The 
club holds its meetings in Room 208,
A. and J., every Wednesday after­
noon at 4 o’clock.
INTERCOLLEGIATE MEET 
SATURDAY.
The ’Varsity track, after a rest of 
two weeks, will journey to Sharon, 
Pa., on Saturday to take part in the 
annual championship meet of the 
Western Pennsylvania Intercollegiate 
Association. Last year our team won 
the title in the meet, which was held 
at Grove City. This year’s team is 
fully as good and prospects are bright 
for another championship. We will 
be without the services of several 
good men on account of scholastic 
standing, especially in the jumps, but 
enough good ones remain to make a 
well-balanced team. The squad will 
’-eturn Saturday night.
The Best Way.
A correspondent wants to know how 
to pronounce Chihuahua. The best 
way is to say Chy-hew-hewa and then 
laugh as though you knew better. If 
it is done artistically, you can get 
away with it nearly every time. The 
same treatment has been frequently 
applied to decollete with great suc­
cess.—York Dispatch.

“Yes,” confessed Mr. Dorkins, “it 
serves me right. I engaged the man 
to move our goods and I forgot to 
ask him how much he was going to 
charge me for the job. If ever I do 
such a thing again, Maria, you can 
have my head for a football.”
“It would be a good deal more prof­
itable, John,” said Mrs. Dorkins, “to 
cut it up into billiard balls.”—Chicago
