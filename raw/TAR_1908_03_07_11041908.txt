THE SQUAD*
PENN GAME
The game Saturday was not by any means a dis­
appointment, even though we would all have prefer­
red to make it still closer. Every member of the 
team, no matter what his position or ability, played 
his hardest all the time.
It would be hard to pick out the stars among our 
men in this game, as all of them were in the game 
all the time. Marshall certainly kept his All-Amer­
ican opponent guessing all the time and Brown 
charged hard all the time. Ramp played his usual 
steady game, and after he had solved Penn’s plays 
gains in his "direction ceased. Beeken seems to have 
struck his gait again, and if nothing unforeseen hap­
pens will take care of his end of the line as it should 
be for the rest of the season. All the backfield cer­
tainly did their share and everybody was sorry to

RUBBER RECLAMATION.
Professor J. H. James.
The increased demand for rubber (about 65,000 
tons being used last year in the United States) has 
led to a diligent search for other rubber-producing 
trees and plants. The larger rubber companies have 
had experts traveling the world over to find new 
sources of rubber. Like starch, rubber is not con­
fined to any one narrow botannical group, but in 
rather widely distributed. Frequently of late years 
newspaper articles have appeared describing the rub­
ber-producing qualities of the well-known Colorado 
rabbit weed. I believe, however, that at the present 
time there is no firm bringing rubber to market from 
this source.
This demand has been so urgent that one of the 
present sources of rubber is the guayisle shrub of 
Mexico and Southwestern Texas. This contains 
about 10% of caoutchouc and 10% of resin. The 
shrub grows to a height of about 30 inches, and is 
pulled up by the roots by the natives and carried on 
the backs of burros to the factories, where the woody 
fibre is removed by grinding and washing. This rub­
ber contains of course resin, which is removed by 
acetone extraction, making a very good grade of 
caoutchouc. This acetone extraction is also applied 
to other cheap rubbers containing too much resin. 
The caoutchouc is the same no matte:.- what its 
source.
This leads me to digress a moment. The rubber 
from the Para district in South America, having the 
lowest per cent, of resin, is taken as the standard of 
quality. Government chemists, upon whom devolves 
the work of writing specifications for the rubber 
goods bought by the government, always specify 
that Para rubber only be used in the manufacture of 
the goods. The manufacturer readily agrees, know­
ing very well that neither the government chemists 
nor any one else can tell whether the rabber used 
was Para, or some cheaper grade of crude rubber, 
from wrhich the resin was extracted by the acetone 
method.
The crude rubber, even the fine Para grade, while
it possesses the resiliency and tensile strength nec­
essary for many purposes, has the disadvantage of 
becoming sticky in summer and brittle in very cold 
winter weather. Goodyear and Hancock’s discovery 
of the effect of sulphur, opened the way to the devel­
opment of the vast rubber industry to the stage we 
see today. Mixed with from five to ten per cent, of 
sulphur and heated, the above disadvantages are 
overcome, and the tensile strength and resiliency of 
the product are even increased over that of the crude 
rubber.
Chemically considered, this reaction brought about 
by heating with sulphur (known technically as vul­
canization), appears to be the formation of an addi­
tion product of the caoutchouc hydrocarbon with 
sulphur. That it is an addition product and not a 
substitution product is proved by the fact that in 
vulcanization, hydrogen sulphide is never observed 
except in traces, and then particularly where heating 
has been too rapid, or some other abnormal condition 
exists.
When the per cent of sulphur is increased to some­
where near thirty, and the heating continued longer, 
the saturation of the hydrocarbon with the sulphur is 
probably attained. This product is known as ebonite 
or hard rubber, and from this are mads hundreds 
and hundreds of articles, of which hard rubber combs, 
battery jars, acid pumps, etc., etc., are examples.
I have too many friends in the rubber business to 
tell all of the many things that are mixed with the 
cheaper grades of rubber goods, but will confine 
my remarks to the manufacture of tires and the 
better class of articles. A certain amount of inert 
material is considered legitimate even in high-class 
goods. A tire, for example, made of pure Para rub­
ber and some sulphur, is not as good as one which a 
mixture oi rubber and sulphur to which metallic 
oxides and other inorganic fillers have been added. 
The inert material evidently exercises a certain pro­
tection, reducing the oxidation and also the mechan­
ical abrasion of the rubber.
These inert fillers, as they at’e called, embrace a 
wide variety of metallic oxides, silicates and sul­
phides. In some instances, as with zinc oxide and 
sulphide, and acetimony sulphide, the filler also 
serves as a coloring agent.
In addition to thesse inorganic fillers, cheaper 
grades of rubber goods have incorporated in them 
organic fillers as well. These are in some cases the 
heavier hydrocarbons, asphalts, etc., and also sub­
stances called in the trade, rubber substitutes, made 
by treating linseed or other oxidizable oils with sul­
phur or sulphur monochloride. The oil substitutes 
can always be detected by submitting the sample to 
the action of alcoholic potash, which effects a sapon­
ification.
The desire for cheaper goods in some lines of man­
ufacture, and the general demand for more rubber 
in recent years has compelled manufacturers to 
work up the articles made of soft vulcanized rubber, 
so that this material could be used over again by 
incorporating a certain amount of this so-called re­

claimed rubber in a new batch of crude rubber, sul­
phur and fillers.
[lie original attempt consisted in merely grinding 
up the scrap, separating H mechanically as far as 
possible from the cotton fibre, and mixing it with the 
fresh batch, as noted above. This, however, gave a 
rather non-uniform product, as the hard particles of 
old rubber do not blend readily.
The next step in rubber reclamation was a pro­
cess copied from the textile manufacturers. Cotton­
wool garments, after being discarded are collected 
and taken to wool reclaiming houses, where the 
material is treated with dilute sulphuric acid, which 
hydrolizes the cellulose, converting it into a brittle 
product which can be dusted out, leaving the wool, 
which is worked over into cheaper grades of cloth.
The rubber reclaimers applied the same idea to 
the removal of the cotton from old hose, shoes, etc., 
then softened the resulting product by beating on 
trays with heavy petroleum oils. This nmde a mass 
easily incorporated into a fresh batch, and this 
method is still worked under the name of the Acid 
Process.
The Alkali Process was the next one devised. This 
consists in heating the ground scrap under pressure 
in autoclaves with caustic soda solution. The caus­
tic soda hydrolizes the cellulose and in addition sa­
ponifies the substitutes that may be present. In 
some instances this alkali boil, is supplemented after 
washing and drying, with the oil saturation as above. 
The alkali process gives a product which admits of 
incorporation in a new' batch with greater ease than 
that yielded by the acid process.
The process which I am to note particularly this 
evening has the merit of novelty at least. It origi­
nated with Dr. Alexander of Charlottenburg, Ger­
many.
The old rubber is ground up and heated in an 
autoclave with benzole at a pressure of about 75 
pounds per square inch. The mass resembles jelly 
after heating. The rubber loses its tensile strength 
and can be separated easily from the fibres in it. 
The hydrocarbon fillers are dissolved by the benzole. 
The mass of jelly-like substance all sticks together 
and the excess of benzole holding fillers in solution 
maf be poured off. After the mixture has been sat­
urated with benzozle it is again placed in the auto­
clave, and now heated with caustic soda solution to 
saponify the linseed oil substitutes. The greater 
part of this soap solution is poured off, not all, how­
ever, as a certain amount of soap is necessary for 
the next step of the process, which consists in treat­
ing the product with a large amount of water in the 
autoclave under considerable pressure. There re­
sults an emulsion of the vulcanized rubber, from 
which the rubber can be recovered by the addition 
of acid.
It is claimed that this process yields a product of 
very nearly uniform grade. If this is so, this pro­
cess or some modification will undoubtedly be the 
one to win out. If by means of this emulsion process 
it will be possible to separate the sulphur-caoutchouc 
compound only from the complex mixture that we
have in any rubber article, a great stride forward 
will have been made. Different manufactures have 
different formulas, so that the rubber reclaimer can­
not begin to turn out a uniform product unless he 
can by some process eliminate the substances with 
which the greatest variation occurs, the fillers, both 
inorganic and organic. The greatest difficulty accom­
panying the use of reclaimed rubbers in manufacture 
is this non-uniformity which must necessarily result 
from the old processes of rubber reclaiming.
1913—NIGHT.
The class held its second meeting on Monday 
evening, October 26, and concluded the business 
which was interrupted at the previous meeting by the 
closing down of the power plant and the sudden, but 
expected appearance of a bunch of 1911 flunkers 
with some of its unsophisticated 1912’s. The followr- 
ing officers were elected to serve through the school 
year oi 1908-’09:
President—O. W. Robinson.
Vice President—Richards.
Secretary—J. McIntosh.
Treasurer—W. C. Scott.
The appointment of the social and athletic com­
mittees and Tartan representative, was deferred 
until the next meeting.
Wanted—Information as to the whereabouts of 
one Sydney Neuman. When last seen, was running 
through the park closely pursued by some of the un­
sophisticated.

Cashier—It helped to pay for the damage done

There is a crowd that goes home immediately after 
Physics on Monday evenings. Probably they don’t 
believe in class spirit. Believe me, their popularity, 
if they ever had any, will be short lived.
1911.
There will be a special class meeting next Tues­
day night to consider business of importance.
Owing to the fact that some details were over­
looked when the date was considered for the dance 
which is to be given by the class of 1911, the social 
committee has deemed it advisable to postpone the 
event one week, making it November 14, in place of 
November 7. Class 1910 has been asked to partici­
pate in this stunt, and it is hoped that the invitation 
will be accepted.

A House-Warming.
Saturday evening, October 24th, Morrison Hall was 
formally opened by a reception to the Faculty of the 
M. M. C. S. The Hall was beautifully decorated 
with flowers and autumn foliage. During the even­
ing ices and cakes were served. All spent a pleas­
ant evening and the Faculty were delighted to find 
that the girls had such a comfortable and artistic 
home. Many beautiful presents were received, 
which will add much to the attractiveness of the 
Hall.
Miss Diescher, now Mrs. Butler, of Boston, is vis­
iting in Pittsburg for a couple of weeks. Her friends 
in the school were glad to see her again. She was 
a guest at luncheon in “the House” on Thursday.
The Senior class has elected the following officers 
for this year:
President—Catherine Ihmsen.
Vice President—Henrietta Alcorn.
Secretary—Dorothy Scott.
Treasurer—Virginia Lee.
Marshals—Mabel Corbould, Ada Ramlack.

“You ask me, while yet in my prime,
To write you a quite simple rhyme—
I fear I’m compelled to answer thee nay,
My thoughts fail to center this October day.
No matter how hard I may try,
My thoughts they do all go astray.
My ancestors all followed the plow,
So you can’t expect me to write poetry now !
’Tis the last fly of summer 
Left here in the room;
All its playful companions 
Are gone up the flume—
Have you gone for the winter 
Somewhere hibernating,
And left it alone
On my dome of thought skating?
The last course of a progressive luncheon given 
for the delegates of the State Federation of Penn­
sylvania Women, was served in the M. M. C. S. Fri­
day afternoon by the Women’s Club of Pittsburg. 
The faculty rooms were beautiful with palms and 
potted plants, and with the handsome gowns of the 
ladies made a gay scene. After the guests had par­
taken of the refreshments, they were shown about 
the building and the work of the school was explain­
ed to them by several of the girls who acted as 
guides. Much interest was shown, and the ladies 
left well pleased with their visit.
Say, girls, didn’t that coffee smell great on Friday?

As I was strolling home today,
I chanced to meet a maiden gay;
And in her hand she held a book,
Reading diligently with every step.
When I asked her what it was all about,
She said that she had just found out 
A way to discover beneath those covers 
The Future’s mysteries and fates.
So would you know your fortune tru<^,
See Fannie Woodside, and she’ll tell you.

(Suitable reward for the first correct solution.)
I used to be quite pert and gay 
Before I came to Tech to stay;
But I have grown quite meek and mild 
Since my first paper on “The Child.”
Such subjects were not meant for me,
As you can very plainly see.
And oh! if you would spare me pain,
Tell me not these lines are vain;
Because, e’en tho’ I am no poet,
I do not wish the world to know it!
Who am I?

About sixty of the M. M. C. S. girls witnessed the 
foot-ball game on Saturday. The section of the 
bleachers reserved for them was quite gay as nearly 
every girl carried a pennant or streamers. Since we 
hadn’t the natural equipment for noise-making that 
the boys were endowed with, they very kindly placed 
the band directly behind us to help us out. How­
ever, some of the girls, didn’t require the assistance 
of the musicians, so enthusiastic were they. It was a 
great game and the girls were proud of the showing 
the team made, and proud to be Tech girls.
Heard in M. M. C. S.
She measured out the butter with a very solemn air, 
The milk and sugar also, and she took 1he greater 
care
To count the eggs correctly, and to add a little bit 
Of baking powder, which, you know, beginners oft

Then she stirred it all together and she baked it for 
an hour;
But she never quite forgave herself for leaving out 
the flour!

The cheering Saturday was better than anything 
we have attempted yet, and The Tartan takes this 
occasion to compliment the student body on the 
progress made, but there still seems to be a minority, 
a very small one, we are glad to say, who will persist 
in the kind of rooting that has gotten for some col­
leges a bad reputation that certainly is not to be 
sought after.
We refer to the hooting and jeering that a great 
many mistake for rooting, and that bears the real 
article no possible resemblance. The first time this 
was in evidence was when Penn at signal practice 
fumbled the ball close to our side of the field imme­
diately a chorus of jeers and hoots was started. We 
are glad to say that the perpetrators received no 
sympathy from the majority of the crowd in this 
kind of work and soon quieted down, but they nev­
ertheless must have been heard from by the Penn 
team.
On one other occasion the aforementioned gentle­
men rose to the emergency in their own inimitable 
way. This time was along in the second half, when 
Dowling seen that all chances of making a successful 
forward pass were gone, preferred to pull the ball in 
and allow himself to be downed in his tracks for a 
loss rather than throw away the ball. At this point 
one or two who considered the play inadvised, seem­
ed to think it necessary to tell Dowling and inci­
dentally any one else who was in ear shot. All we 
can say in regard to Dowling is that any man who 
works as hard and consistently for Tech as he does 
is certainly not to be condemned for one error of 
judgment, and before we would be willing to pro­
nounce him guilty we would have to have some more 
expert testimony than any of the audible testimony 
Saturday.
As gentle means seem to be misunderstood 
wouldn’t it be well to drop the next offender over 
the back of the bleachers or give him some punish­
ment he is capable of understanding?
We are printing in this issue a call for candidates 
for the Mandolin Club. It seems that the former 
active members have thrown up the sponge as it 
were. Here’s hoping that enough new ones will be 
found to keep this very creditable organization 
going.
In all probability a majority of the students saw 
a notice posted on the bulletin board in the main 
corridor announcing the fact that the Director had 
appointed an auditing committee to go over the 
books of the Athletic Association.
A perfectly proper proceeding, indeed, but why 
shouldn’t the student body take enough interest to 
do a little auditing on their own account? A state­
ment was printed a few issues ago showing the in­
debtedness of the field account. There seemed to 
be some surprise at that time on account of its size; 
but no more decisive action was taken than the lift­
ing of eyebrows.
As we said before, the treasurer has not made 
us any report because he has had nobody to report 
to. We made some money on the Penn game. The 
exact amount will be published next week. Doesn’t 
anybody want to know where the money goes? We 
have a student contribution now. Does any one 
know how much of it goes to Athletics, and why? 
Who apportions this money? Are we supposed to 
be self-governing or not? It is said that those least 
governed are best governed. If that be so, our gov­
ernment must be almost perfect as far as anything 
done by ourselves is concerned. Other colieges have 
tried both extremes of student and Faculty govern­
ment and neither one alone seems to be successful. 
So let us get busy and start a combination of the two.
Elect a representative from each class to adopt 
the constitution, now in waiting. It was prepared by 
the student committee under Faculty advice last 
year. And then we will be in a position to apportion 
our own money.
October 30th, 1908.
1 have this day appointed an Auditing Committee 
to look over the accounts of the Cashier of the Stu­

DAY INDUSTRIAL.CALENDAR.
In the best game ever seen between two class 
teams in this school, last Friday afternoon the Day 
Industrials defeated the Plebes by the score of 6 to
5. Each team scored a touchdown, but Mullen’s fail­
ure at kicking goal lost the game for his team.
The Upper Draftsmen’s class claim the distinction 
of being the only class in the school to have three of 
its members playing on the ’Varsity foot-ball team, 
they being represented by Brown, Frampton and 
Herschell. For a class nineteen, this is going some.

A FAMOUS NEW YORK HATTER MAKES

---------------------------------------------------

IOTHE TARTAN
TECH LOSES TO PITT.
With Pitt assembling at the Union Station for 
their parade, and Tech at the B. & O. Station at the 
same time, Pittsburg police were a little nervous 
for a short time yesterday afternoon. Promptly at
2 the Tech student band struck up, and led the pro­
cession of 600 in columns of 4, up Smithfield street. 
Swinging into Fifth avenue from Grant street at a 
lively gait, the parade made its way thru the street 
crowded with spectators. Over the Sixth Street 
Bridge, the crowd went, arriving at the Exposition 
Park in time to see the last part of the Plebe game.
The ’Varsity cheers with 12 on the end, were given 
again and again, as the plucky Plebes held the Pitt 
Freshmen to a 0—0 score.
Old man Zug, with his bugle, was given a hearty 
round of cheering as the men came on the field.
It was 3:12 when the ball was kicked off, due to the 
fact that Manager Thompson had a number of pro­
tests to make on the non-eligibility of about half 
Pitt’s star players.
The Game in Detail.
Lindsay kicked off to Hittner, who lost the ball to 
Beekin on a fumble. Frampton made two yards 
thru the line, which Dowling lost around left end. 
Hittner punted to Roe, who was downed on the 25- 
yard line. Quailey gained 10 yards around right 
end, the ball in Tech’s territory all the time.
Richards tried the line for two bucks, which netted 
the Pitties eight yards. The ball was on Tech's 4- 
yard line when Richards carried it three farther, 
and Quailey carried it over for a touchdown after 
four minutes’ of play. Elliott failed at goal, making 
the score—Pitt 5, Tech 0.
Brown kicked off to Roe, who ran out of bounds 
after being tackled by Hittner on the 37-yard line. 
Pitt penalized 15 yards for holding. Ent was thrown 
by McCorkle after an attempt at a forward pass. 
Pitt gains on a fake kick, after which Hittner gained 
30 yards on an onside kick, losing 10 of it on a fum­
bled punt.
Hittner kicked 40 yards to Barrett, who was 
downed in his tracks by Dowling. Roura was then 
substituted for Frampton. Richards gains, then Roe, 
and another gain by Richards ends in a squabble 
among the officials as to whether it is first down or 
not. 15 yards lost on a forward pass. Hittner ran 
for a touchdown but was called back. Pitt kicked 
•fo Hittner, who was downed on the spot. Pitt 
gained five yards at left end and was penalized 
15 yards for holding. Quailey gains two yards thru
right tackle, Richards making a gain thru the same 
»egion.
Richards punted 40 yards to Brown, who was 
downed by Lindsay. Dowling makes a small loss, 
and on a fake kick Hittner was thrown back by Van 
Doren and hurt. Time taken out.
Hittner kicks and Schmucker recovers the ball, 
having just entered the game in Roura’s place. Quai­
ley hurt and replaced by Ent. Tech kicked to 
Barrett, and Brown made five yards around the right 
end. Dowling makes four yards thru the center, and 
Van Doren blocks Brown’s punt which Beekin re­
covered on the 8-yard line. Brown punted to Rich­
ards, who ran 30 yards to a touchdown. Lindsay 
kicks goal, making the score—Pitt 11, Tech 0.
Tech kicked off to Lindsay, who was downed by 
McCorkle on the 55-yard line, leaving “Texas” and 
“Beek” both on the field hurt. Quailey gained 10 
yards around right and Pitt was penalized 15 yards 
for holding. Pitt made three small gains and was 
again penalized 15 yards for holding. Richards 
kicked to Brown, who was downed in his tracks. 
Brown punted to Barrett, and Rosser tried the line 
for no gains. Richards ran for a touchdown and 
was tackled and downed by Hittner on the 0-yard 
line. Pitt tried to punt out, but missed. ,Scove— 
Pitt 16, Tech 0.
Brown kicked to Rosser, and Richards tried the 
line for no gain. Rosser gains 10 yards at center. 
Richards tries a fake kick and end run, but is downed 
by Marshall breaking thru the line. Richards made 
no gain on a try around the end, the half was up.
Pitt started their dance on the field and covered 
about 100 yards with their men single file. Their 
stunt is to wind, then unwind, and keep the goat 
that led the procession going ahead.
The second half started at 4:14 with a kick by 
Brown to Barrett. Ent got thru the left end but 
was tackled and brot back by Halferty. Richards 
makes no gain at right end. Hittner caught Rich­
ards’ punt and made a spectacular run of 30 yards 
in a broken field, but was brot back for holding.
Tech’s ball first down on a fumble. Hittner failed 
at the forward pass and was thrown back for a loss, 
Pitt getting the ball.
Richards hits the line for five yards and
Ent failed to budge it. Halferty tackles 
Barrett back of the line for a loss. Pitt
fumbles but recovers the ball. Richards tried to
make a drop kick for a field goal and failed. Ent
got the ball on a punt and was run back for 20 yards, 
when Tech was penalized six yards. Richards

gains 10 yards thru the line, and Ent gains slightly 
on a fake pass. Barrett runs for a touchdown and 
Pitt kicks goal. Score—Pitt 22, Tech 0.
Brown kicks off to Ent. Roe gets the ball on a 
fumble and is tackled after a 15-yard run by Hittner. 
Richards gains 15 yards thru center and Pitt is 
penalized 15 yards for holding.
Richards makes no gain on a fake kick, and 
Schmucker, after a fumble and a blocked kick take 
place, does not gain thru the line. Ent tries a gain 
around the left end, but it does not materialize. Pitt 
gains thru center. Hittner gets Pitt’s kick and in 
running it back 15 yards does some of the prettiest 
work of the game. Richards fails to gain.
McCorkle was hurt and went to the side, Patter­
son taking his place. Patterson gained 39 yards on 
a forward pass, but the ball went to Pitt, who fum­
bled, Crawford getting it. Pitt punted to Tech and 
Hittner returned the kick to Barrett. Richards 
gained 10 yards thru the center, being tackled and 
downed by Hittner. Tech got the ball on downs, 
and Brown failed to gain. Tech was penalized five 
yards and Hittner punted out of bounds, Pitt got the 
ball, and failed to gain at center. Richards gained 
three yards and Pitt punted out of bounds. Tech’s 
ball and Hittner returned the kick.
Score—Pitt 22; Tech 0.

THE PENNSYLVANIA GAME.
By “Loug.”
(With apologies to Macaulay.)
Bill Knox’s face was sad,
Bill Knox’s brow was low.
He darkly glared at Pennsy’s team, 
Our Tech School’s mighty foe.
•
“Gee Whiz! my goodness grapenuts!’ 
Our startled rooters said,
“This will not be a feet-ball game,— 
’Twill murder be, instead!”
And five to two the rooters
Of Pennsylvania bet
That Penn would score up fifty and
Poor Tech a goose-egg get. N
The first half,—goodness gracious,—
Penn acted mighty mean,
Two touchdowns and two field goals 
Made Pennsy’s score nineteen.
Then Billy Knox between halves 
Just told them what was what;
“Now, boys, go out and shove Old Penn 
All over this here lot!”
It gave the team much confidence 
To hear his thusly speak;
McCorkle played a nifty game 
And likewise “Little Beek.”
And Buddy Ramp, the mighty 
Played like a knight of old;
And Winkus Dowling’s tackling was 
A marvel to behold.
Penn thought that as a tackle 
Their own could not be beat,—
But in that game Bull Marshall just 
Played Draper off his feet.
And Marshall, at the finish,
Exclaimed, “By George, I find 
That ‘All-American’ tackles are 
Just like the other kind!”
And sometimes Pennsy’s runner would 
Would nearly break through Tech,
Bui Billy H. would tackle him 
And sit upon his neck.
And when ’twas nearly over,
They blocked a Pennsy kick,—
Beek grabbed the ball and started 
For Penn’s goal mighty quick.
But oh! outrageous fortune,
’Twas not quite quick enough!
They downed him on the ten-yard line, 
Now that rather tough!
And then the game was over,
Poor Tech had failed to score,
And Penn had scored but one touchdown, 
Which gave them six points more.
So ev’rybody holler 
And make a lot of noise,
For Penn scored only twenty-five 
Upon our Tech School boys.
Three cheers for our brave warriors.— 
You bet that they’re hot stuff!
They held Old Penn to twentyy-five, 
That’s “pretty good enough!”

Somebody had said, “look out for ‘Bill Bryan,’ he's

Mr. A. to Mr. L. (in the Foundry)—“Say, Mr. B.’s 
a loafer, do you know it? He quits the job every 
fifteen minutes and stays away an hour.”
Mr. Shafer (in Chemistry)—“1 knew of a woman 
whose hair turned perfectly white in one night.” 
“Now what kind of a change would you call that?”
Boulfrois—“A physical change.”
Mr. Shafer—“No, chemical change.”
Mr. Connelley (having caught a Day Industrial in 
the corridor of the second floor with a lighted stogie 
in his mouth)—“That’s all right, my boy, hold it, but 
don’t blow it.”
"Lefty” Harrison (in the Pattern Shop)—“Are 
there any ‘compressed air’ vises?”
Mr. Pfouts—“Most of them are ‘hot air’ vices.”

Mr. Field (casually)—“You can't saw wood with

Mr. Steen—“No!” “For instance, take black. 
There is only one shade of black, and that is crow-

Mr. Boulfrois wishes to tender a vote of thanks 
and offer congratulations to Mr. Pfouts, and his able 
assistants for that reserved seat ticket rack they 
made. It’s one of the niftiest ever turned out, and 
would make a ‘Philadelphia Box Office Man’ green

There was no use for ‘tanglefoot’ in room No. 115 
during ‘flv time.’ Prof. Kellar and Mr. Leeds each 
armed with a big newspaper and a strong right, 
were a perfect terror to the summer pests.
After the big game with Pennsylvania last Hal­
lowe’en, in which our boys acquitted themselves so 
creditably, one of the “Tid-Bits” in the way of enter­
tainment, was a large box party at the Duquesne 
Theatre. The Technites under the careful surveil­
lance of Coach “Sol” Metzgar of Pennsylvania, with 
his Red and Blue warriors, occupied a similar posi­
tion on the right of the house. The boxes were
gayly draped in the respective colors of the teams, 
and a regulation foot-ball formed the center-piece of 
the decorations on each side. At the end of the sec­
ond act, Manager “Buck” Thomson presented Miss 
“Nance O'Neill,” the star of the play, with an im­
mense boquet of three dozen white chrysanthemums, 
tied with Tech and Penn ribbons, which the boys 
had clubbed together and donated as a token of their 
esteem. A fair sized audience, composed mostly of 
Carnegie Tech and Pennsylvania followers, honored 
the occasion with their presence. And on the second 
curtain call at the end of the play, the boys rose to 
their feet and gave a rousing three times three and 
a “Nance O’Neill,” in which, it is worthy of note, the 
Dean Connelley carried the obligato.
This is the one we used yesterday at the Univer­
sity of Pittsburg game.
To the tune of “D—R—E—A—M—I—N—G.”
Moving, we’re moving,
Moving right in on that Pitt squad.
We scared them bad at this time last year.
We’re going to beat them today don’t fear.
Moving, we’re moving,
Moving right down to their goal line,
What do we want,—yell a TOUCHDOWN, for 
Tech boys, and we’ll sure win.

Vatz—“Please tell me a question.”
Mr. Steen—"Isn’t it odd that Coopers writing on 
land was dryer than that on water?”
Finkel—“Gee! my chocolate eclair is a vacuum.
Important event!—Mr. Pilkington smiled on Tues­
day.
Taggart (translating German)— The tables have 
no boots.
It has been very wisely suggested that all tri-Jun­
iors leave their cemetery addresses with the secre­
tary to insure correct shipment of the remains of 
any who may “pass from our midst” as a result of 
over-work.

MANDOLIN CLUB.
All men in the school who can play the mandolin, 
guitar, or violin, are extended a cordial invitation to 
join the Mandolin Club, and should without fail come 
to the Assembly Hall next Sunday afternoon. The 
club is reorganizing for its third season and expects 
that this year will be even more successful than the 
previous ones. Mr. M. J. Scheidlmeir, whose artis­
tic ability as leader has been well shown in previous 
years, is hard at work coaching the individual players 
and selecting new music. The matter of new players 
is one on which special emphasis must be laid. By 
graduation and by leaving school, the club has lost 
quite a number of members, and it is absolutely nec­
essary to have more instruments in order to have 
enough sound volume to fill large halls, like the Car­
negie. If you can play, come out and join the bunch 
for a good time. Don’t be bashful! There is plenty 
of time to get into good shape, if work is begun im­
mediately. Practice is held every Sunday afternoon 
at three o’clock.
