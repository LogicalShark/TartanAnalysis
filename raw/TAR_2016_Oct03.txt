First Lady Michelle Obama 
visited Pittsburgh this past 
Wednesday to hit the cam-
paign trail on behalf of Dem-
ocratic presidential nominee 
Hillary Clinton. The event 
took place at the University 
of Pittsburgh’s Fitzgerald 
Field House with entry lines 
spanning four blocks.
The event kicked off 
at 2:30 p.m. with rous-
ing speeches from several 
Allegheny County notables.
First came Betsy Good, 
the Pennsylvania Campus or-
ganizer at the University of 
Pittsburgh, who spoke about 
why she joined the Clinton 
campaign. Good described 
how after the 2008 recession, 
when her father was laid 
off, “working families like 
[hers] deserved more.” Now, 
her dad will be casting his 
?rst vote ever this November 
for Clinton.
Providing opportunity was 
a common theme through-
out the afternoon. Allegheny 
County Executive Rich 
Fitzgerald spoke about how 
prior to the Obama presi-
dency, the U.S. was losing 
700,000 jobs a month. In 
response to the President be-
ing attacked in today’s me-
dia, Fitzgerald countered, 
“Barack Obama has kept 
America great.”
Most moving, however, 
was Councilman DeWitt 
Walton’s speech, which 
he opened with Langston 
Hughes’ poem “A Dream De-
ferred.” Walton revealed that 
his maternal grandfather 
missed being a slave by just 
two years, following Lincoln’s 
Emancipation Proclamation. 
The African American com-
munity was able to progress 
under Kennedy, Carter, and 
Obama, and DeWitt stated 
that “if we do not want a 
dream deferred, we must 
elect Hillary Clinton.”
The First Lady came onto 
the stage at 3:45 p.m. after an 
introduction from the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh’s band and 
Saket Rajprohat, a sopho-
more economics major and 
?rst generation American 
who joined the Clinton cam-
paign because of Clinton’s 
inclusive platform towards 
immigrants. Immediately 
upon taking the stage, The 
First Lady was met with loud 
applause from the audience 
attempting to document the 
moment. The elegance and 
con?dence of the First Lady 
was apparent from just one 
look at the podium.
Michelle Obama began 
her speech by talking about 
the bittersweet transition out 
of the White House. There 
is “lots of uncertainty,” she 
said, a sentiment shared by 
most Americans. Throughout 
her speech, Michelle Obama 
never outright mentioned 
Clinton’s opponent Donald 
Trump by name, but very 
openly alluded to him sev-
eral times. Both the President 
and Trump have publicly ex-
pressed disapproval of each 
other in the past. Michelle 
Obama spoke of “those who 
dared to question whether 
[her] husband was from the 
United States of America,” 
and tried very hard to “un-
dermine [her] husband’s 
presidency.” She quoted her 
husband’s famous phrase, “I 
will go high when they take 
a low,” bringing cheers and 
applause from the crowd.
Like most opponents of 
Trump, Michelle Obama then 
commented on his demeanor 
in the public eye. She called 
out his often brash outbursts 
saying “we need a grownup in 
the White House” and “some-
one who will take the job 
seriously.” Such a critique is 
warranted to an extent, given 
that the president is under 
“the harshest light there re-
ally is.” Candidates must be 
able to hold their composure 
under pressure, because after 
all, the presidency is reserved 
for those who can make 
decisions under severe stress.
The rally then shifted to 
Hillary Clinton’s attributes. 
Michelle Obama pointed 
out Clinton’s extensive ex-
perience, her character, her 
commitment to the country, 
her advocacy for kids with 
disabilities and quality child-
care. And though she did not 
win the nomination in 2008, 
her approval rating skyrock-
eted as Secretary of State. As 
a testament to her stamina, 
Michelle Obama stated that 
Clinton “gets right back up” 
in the face of adversity. She 
also noted that only Clinton 
has visited 112 countries, 
negotiated a cease?re and a 
peace agreement, and spent 
11 hours testifying before 
Congressional Committees.
Commenting on the 
public’s vocal criticism of 
Clinton, The First Lady re-
futed, “when I hear folks say-
ing they don’t feel inspired, I 
have to disagree.” Clinton’s 
persistence and consistency 
have been key points in the 
2016 election. “No one in our 
lifetime has ever had as much 
experience and exposure to 
the presidency; no one, not 
Barack, not Bill, nobody, and 
yes, she just happens to be a 
woman” observed Michelle 
Obama as the crowd abso-
lutely erupted in cheers. At 
the end of the day, history has 
taught us that experience, 
preparation, and tempera-
ment matter when electing 
our Commander in Chief.
This decision to vote for 
Clinton, as opposed to the al-
ternative, rests primarily on 
whether someone can handle 
the opportunity to lead this 
country. Michelle Obama 
advised undecided voters to 
ask themselves which can-
didate is honestly the most 
quali?ed and speaks to the 
values we as Americans share. 
Like the common theme in 
the opening speeches, the 
First Lady also brought up 
the values of “inclusion, 
opportunity, and sacri?ce.”
Finally, Michelle Obama 
noted that this election is not 
just about who votes, but who 
does not vote. In 2012, voters 
under the age of 30 provided 
a margin of victory for Presi-
dent Obama in 14 states. 
This year, like all elections, 
every vote matters. Michelle 
Obama revealed that “in 2012 
Barack won Pennsylvania 
just by 300,000 votes.” This 
may seem like a lot, but it is 
only a difference of 17 per-
cent of votes per precinct. So, 
if you are on the fence and 
questioning whether your 
vote matters, keep in mind 
that most elections are very 
close, and every vote counts.

When we think of 
standing up for what we 
believe in, it may seem 
counterintuitive to do so by 
instead taking a knee. How-
ever, that’s exactly what Co-
lin Kaepernick, San Francis-
co 49ers quarterback, began 
doing on Sept. 1 when he 
kneeled during the national 
anthem to protest recent po-
lice brutality cases against 
unarmed black citizens. 
This bold move only added 
fuel to the ongoing cultural 
debate surrounding race re-
lations, law enforcement, 
and the Black Lives Matter 
movement.
In this context, Carnegie 
Mellon students gathered 
on Sept. 27 for the inaugural 
event of the monthly cam-
pus discussion series, “State 
of the University,” to hold a 
conversation about “Colin 
Kaepernick, #BLM and how 
it all affects our campus.” 
Sarah Duncan, event orga-
nizer and Carnegie Mellon 
community adviser, ex-
plained that her goal with 
the series “is to have it really 
be an exchange of perspec-
tives between undergradu-
ates, grad students, staff, 
faculty and whoever else 
would want to be involved.” 
The event revolved around 
?ve chairs at the front of the 
lecture hall, which attendees 
joined and left at will. This 
provided a constantly rotat-
ing cast of perspectives on 
the night’s topic, “why take 
a knee?”
At ?rst, debate ensued 
over the titular subject: 
Kaepernick’s protest, its 
meaning, and why it was im-
mediately met with such vis-
ceral backlash. Students, fac-
ulty, and staff in attendance 
agreed on Kaepernick’s right 
to peaceful dissent, but indi-
viduals’ reasons for support-
ing this right varied widely.
Some empathized with 
the idea that challenging the 
injustices minorities face on 
a daily basis doesn’t make 
one less of an American. 
Others saw taking a knee 
during the national anthem 
as an assertion of citizens’ 
rights to freedom of speech. 
One student asserted that, 
“[Kaepernick] doesn’t have 
to show respect for his coun-
try if his country’s not re-
specting him,” a statement 
that resonated strongly with 
the audience.
Furthermore, many who 
spoke felt that criticizing the 
appropriateness of the pro-
test’s timing unfairly ignored 
the gravity of Kaepernick’s 
message. This shifted the 
group’s focus to the dif?cul-
ties of spreading awareness 
about Black Lives Matter at 
Carnegie Mellon speci?cally, 
including instances wher-
estudents reacting negative-
ly to posts on the Facebook 
group “Overheard at Carn-
egie Mellon” or painting the 
Fence. Duncan noted that 
this was, “such an important 
shift” in the conversation 
that “really gave people an

Most students on campus 
could guess that the Hunt Li-
brary was funded through a 
donation of someone whose 
last name was Hunt. Lesser 
known among the student 
body is the history behind 
the Hunt family and most 
importantly, Rachel McMas-
ters Miller Hunt. Throughout 
her lifetime residing on Ells-
worth Avenue in Shadyside, 
Rachel acquired an array of 
artifacts re?ecting her fas-
cination with the botanical 
world. By the 1950’s, the 
collection was well known 
in the academic world, and 
Rachel came to publish the 
Catalogue of Botanical Books 
in the Collection of Rachel 
McMasters Miller Hunt.
In an attempt to preserve 
this legacy close to its home, 
the Hunt family generously 
donated Rachel’s collection 
to Carnegie Tech, accompa-
nied by a building to house 
both the collection and a li-
brary. For those who are un-
aware of the mysterious ?fth 
?oor of Hunt library, current-
ly known as the Hunt Botani-
cal Institute, this is where 
Rachel Hunt’s botanical 
collection can be found.
Since 1964, the institute 
has been working to preserve 
and foster further growth of 
the botanical arts by display-
ing an international exhibit. 
The exhibit brings together 
the botanical community 
from across the world, in-
cluding the Botanical Soci-
ety, which hosts a conference 
at the institute during the in-
ternational exhibition. Cur-
rently, the 15th International 
Exhibition is on display.
When the exhibition ?rst 
began, the world of botanical 
art existed with many more 
restraints than it does now. 
In 1964, the institute only 
accepted art that had been 
published. Considering the 
fact that many ?ne artists do 
not seek out having their art 
published in scienti?c jour-
nals or texts, this excluded a 
lot of talent from the series. 
As perspectives have become 
more accepting of the notion 
that botanical art is equally 
as artistic as other forms of 
?ne art, the institute has 
grown to accept submissions 
from a wide array of artists.
The selection process is 
conducted by Curator of Art

DOMINIQUE ESCANDON
Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet Writer 
of The Student Government. 
It would be unjust of 
Student Government leaders 
to pretend that current events 
don’t affect students’ lives 
on campus, regardless of the 
looming legacy of the Carnegie 
Mellon Bubble. In light of this, 
an of?cial statement was post-
ed on Vaasavi Unnava (Student 
Body President) and Aaron 
Gutierrez’s (Student Body Vice 
President) Facebook page as an 
offering of support to the mem-
bers of our community who 
might be feeling distressed by 
the recent deaths of unarmed 
black people at the hands of 
the police.
When regarding matters of 
campus wellness, Student Gov-
ernment should take an active 
role in addressing the unique 
struggles each student might 
face during their time at Carn-
egie Mellon, since these chal-
lenges can’t be alleviated or 
resolved without being recog-
nized ?rst. However, we must 
also serve as a representative 
voice of our diverse commu-
nity, unbiased and undeclared 
in political standing, in order 
to not sti?e potential impor-
tant discussions on issues or 
movements that could arise 
elsewhere on campus.
Some of the most important 
and relevant discussions about 
race relations, mental health 
awareness, or sexual health 
that I’ve engaged in at Carnegie 
Mellon, be it with my room-
mate on a Tuesday at 2 a.m. 
when I should have been study-
ing (or maybe cramming is the 
better word), or at a casual din-
ner with my friends, have oc-
curred naturally outside of the 
in?uence of Student Govern-
ment. This is, in part, because 
we felt free to express our ideas 
without the weight of a super-
?cial entity or stance placed 
upon us by student leaders we 
might have never had a conver-
sation with.
What’s so amazing about 
these moments is that they 
indicate that our community 
really is invested in bettering 
itself and is aware of the steps it 
must take to accomplish its re-
spective goals. This was heav-
ily re?ected in the most recent 
State of the University, orga-
nized by the Community Ad-
visers, centered around Colin 
Kaepernick, #BlackLivesMat-
ter, and how these events affect 
Carnegie Mellon.
Once more, it was recog-
nized that Carnegie Mellon 
still has a long way to go before 
it can be considered a fully in-
tegrated community. Where 
are our professors of under-
represented minority groups? 
How often do we interact with 
campus policemen of the same, 
or different, race or gender 
than us? What is keeping our 
students from engaging in 
social discussions, or protesting 
for a cause they care about? 
Why has the discussion on 
Carnegie Mellon’s active role in 
gentrifying Pittsburgh been so 
sparse, despite its huge effects 
to our neighbors? An agree-
ment was established: Carn-
egie Mellon has to do more.
The most engaging part of 
the State of the University was 
the interchange of ideas be-
tween campus administrators 
and students. Our faculty has 
incredible connections and di-
rect experience with many of 
these matters and, when paired 
with the mass innovation of 
our students and the fund-
ing and organizational struc-
ture of Student Government, 
they can create the lasting 
change towards inclusion and 
diversity we would all love to 
see on campus.
So please: continue to 
engage in meaningful conver-
sation about what you want 
Carnegie Mellon University 
to look like in ten years, in 
?ve years, or even tomorrow. 
Seek opportunities to engage 
with different members of our 
community and the Pittsburgh 
community at large, so we can 
continue to grow our under-
standing in how we can better 
ourselves.
And of course, if you ever 
feel like you need support along 
the way, you can always reach 
out to a Student Government 
Cabinet member for guidance 
or support.

Some people ?nd it 
dif?cult to balance work and 
exercise, but Sue Lipman 
wasn’t one of those people.
Lipman was a dedicated 
athlete and social worker for 
the Children’s Hospital of 
Pittsburgh. After losing her 
battle with cancer in 2010, 
Lipman’s family founded 
sue’s run4kids as a way to 
honor Lipman’s memory and 
her work.
“My mom had a way of 
making everyone feel wel-
come and included,” Sue’s 
daughter and race director 
Jill Lipman Beck said in a 
press release. “She believed 
in having fun while doing 
good. We’ve taken these val-
ues and turned them into a 
fun, vibrant event.”
On Oct. 9 at 8:30 a.m., 
sue’s run4kids will be taking 
place in Schenley Park. The 
event includes a 4-mile race, 
a 1-mile race for kids, and 
2-mile and 1-mile fun runs. 
There will be a pre-race and 
post-race party at the Viet-
nam Veterans Pavilion that 
will have free food and drinks 
from Bruegger’s Bagels, Eat 
‘n Park, and Smallman Street 
Deli. All money raised from 
the run will go to the Kids-
Voice’s Lipman Youth Fund, 
which works with programs 
that aid teens in foster care.
“The Lipman Youth Fund 
enables KidsVoice to pro-
vide special projects and 
programs designed to help 
teenagers in the foster care 
system access assistance and 
resources to enable them to 
successfully transition to in-
dependence and adulthood 
outside of the child welfare 
system,” Beck said. “This is 
an extremely vulnerable, 
but often overlooked popu-
lation. Sue’s run is the only 
fundraiser for the Lipman 
Youth Fund, so we want to 
grow the event so that we 
can grow the fund and help 
more kids achieve success 
and independence.”
KidsVoice, the larger or-
ganization that the Lipman 
Youth fund donates to, is 
extremely involved in Al-
legheny County. According 
to their website, KidsVoice 
helps almost 3,000 children 
in the child-welfare system 
of the County’s Juvenile 
Court system.
This organization’s staff is 
unique in that their goal, ac-
cording to their website, is to 
focus on “the kids’ education-
al, medical, mental health 
and social security matters as 
well as providing representa-
tion for minor criminal cita-
tions and for expungement 
of delinquency records.” 
They also help older clients 
with applying to colleges and 
jobs as they prepare to live on 
their own.
Since December 2008, 
the Lipman Youth Fund at 
KidsVoice has helped the or-
ganization update its web-
site to include more infor-
mation about the important 
work KidsVoice is a part of. 
Additionally, the fund has 
helped establish the Clean 
Slate program. This makes 
sure that children facing 
minor legal charges are sup-
ported by a reliable adult 
when they are dealing with 
an of?cer or judge and their 
parents cannot satisfy that 
adult role. Also, this fund is 
helping the Independent Liv-
ing Resources Fairs, whose 
goal is to help teenagers in 
foster care with ?nding pro-
grams that will help them 
to eventually live indepen-
dently. The organization 
truly coincides with how 
Lipman wanted to impact 
the community.
“Sue was an incredible 
person,” Sue’s husband Rod 
Lipman said in a press re-
lease. “Although she spent 
her career helping young 
children, she also mentored 
a number of teens and young 
adults, helping them to ?nd 
a path to success. The goal is 
for the Lipman Youth Fund to 
do that for kids who are ag-
ing out of the foster care sys-
tem - put them on their own 
paths to success.”
If college students are in-
terested in helping out with 
the event, there are many 
possible ways that they can 
get involved.
“They can register to run 
or walk in one of the events 
(www.suesrun4kids.org),” 
Beck said. “They can volun-
teer to help pack our awe-
some race bags, which we 
do the weekend before the 
race. They can even hold a 
fundraiser and raise money 
for sue’s run and the Lipman 
Youth Fund.”
CMU students attend screenings of the ?rst Presidential debate  
SHLOK GOYAL

Students gathered in 
classrooms, auditoriums, 
and dormitories, with Bingo 
cards and laptops in hand 
on the night of Sept. 26 in 
preparation for the ?rst 
Presidential debate between 
Democratic nominee Hill-
ary Clinton and Republican 
nominee Donald Trump.
The event resembled a 
party. In Stever’s TV lounge, 
around 70 students watched 
the debate.
“Everyone’s really excited. 
It’s like a man landing on a 
moon. You don’t know what 
happens next,” Jeffrey Zhang, 
a ?rst-year in the College of 
Engineering, said before the 
debate started.
From the start, students 
broke out in bursts of laughter 
at the sight of Trump’s dead 
expression while Clinton 
was delivering her opening 
remarks. Students whooped 
and snickered throughout 
the debate, especially when 
Trump spoke.
“Most people are here just 
to see what’s actually going 
to be talked about and how 
funny it is because of who 
the candidates are,” Akash 
Bansal, a ?rst-year in the 
College of Engineering, said.
Senior Economics major 
Michael Rosenberg watched 
the debate for a different rea-
son. “I thought it would be 
useful to at least look on the 
sidelines and watch America’s 
traditionally resilient institu-
tions just fall apart in front of 
my eyes,” he said.
At ?rst, Trump started off 
with a simple message of ?s-
cal conservatism. But, as the 
night wore on, his reactions 
to Clinton’s statements about 
him as well as interruptions of 
both Clinton and the modera-
tor Lester Holt, quickly grew 
more and more exaggerated.
“When the moderator 
says, ‘we don’t have time,’ 
he says, ‘no, I’m talking’ and 
then he just doesn’t shut 
up,” Sonia Berg, an electrical 
and computer engineering 
major, said.
“I am concerned that 
people might have just 
watched the ?rst 30 minutes 
and thought that Trump did 
a better job than I would say 
he did overall,” said graduate 
student Daniel Bork.
At ?rst, Clinton attempted 
to be very aggressive in at-
tacking Trump by using 
his past statements against 
him. Soon, though, she re-
sponded to Trump’s hyper-
boles simply by shaking her 
head and smiling, snidely 
expressing the absurdity of 
Trump’s statements.
On her own policy 
matters, though, student re-
actions indicated that Clinton 
wasn’t particularly memo-
rable. In fact, when Clinton 
spoke, many students’ heads 
turned back towards lap-
tops and homework until 
she criticized Trump in some 
humorous way.
“She didn’t close the 
deal,” said former Chief of 
Staff for House Speaker John 
Boehner Barry Jackson at 
Carnegie Mellon the day after 
the debate.
Even so, students felt en-
tertained. “This is a hilari-
ous circus of sorts,” alumnus 
Kevin Levin said.
In Rashid Auditorium in 
Gates Center, many of the 
20 people had a bingo card, 
with each box containing a 
topic or a “Trumpism” — a 
bizarre Trump statement that 
he repeatedly says — that one 
crosses out if it is mentioned 
in the debate. Students face-
tiously ?lled it out, eagerly 
waiting for each term to be 
said out loud.
Comical as the debate may 
have been, it also raised seri-
ous concerns among students. 
“The fact that the debate is 
happening is a reminder to me 
that America is declining. The 
fact that we can have people 
with such snake oil trying to 
speak as though he’s a ratio-
nal actor upsets me. And it’s 
a reminder to me that no one 
of good thoughtfulness, posi-
tive leadership qualities goes 
into politics anymore,” said 
Rosenberg.
Berg followed PolitiFact’s 
Twitter feed while watch-
ing the debate. PolitiFact 
judges whether or not a can-
didate’s statements are true. 
“Watching people fact-check 
stuff was hysterical,” Berg 
said. Both candidates made 
a surprising number of false 
claims, although Trump was 
certainly more guilty of say-
ing untrue statements than 
Clinton was.
Clinton was declared by 
many to be the winner of 
the debate and, in national 
polling after the debate, she 
held on average a four-point 
lead, up from her one-to-two 
point lead before, accord-
ing to the website FiveThir-
tyEight. While the debate 
largely is a boon for Clinton’s 
hopes of becoming president, 
the mockery it became re-
?ects poorly on the state of 
American politics.
Rosenberg, who will 
graduate after this year, ex-
pressed a concern shared by 
other students, when he said 
of this debate, “It doesn’t 
bode well for my future.”

things that had been on their 
mind for a long time.”
Eventually, this discussion 
began to focus on the black 
and African American com-
munities’ lack of representa-
tion on campus. Indeed, the 
majority of the hands in the 
room were raised when one 
member of the University 
community asked frankly, 
“How many [people] are 
wondering why we have such 
low numbers of black and Af-
rican American professors?” 
This query was quickly raised 
in relation to the Carnegie 
Mellon student body as well, 
and many speakers expressed 
that efforts to expand the 
black community would 
help foster much-needed 
discourse about these issues 
campus-wide.
However, speakers 
suggested that students’ un-
awareness of social justice 
issues ultimately stemmed 
from an intense focus on ca-
reer-oriented goals instead 
of a desire to be active in a 
broader community. As Dun-
can said, “It’s so easy for us 
as an institution to focus on 
academics, but sometimes 
it’s important to take some 
time to re?ect and talk about 
something else important.”
Several steps to combat 
these problems were 
suggested, including of-
fering a Black Lives Matter 
class or designating a forum 
speci?cally to talk about re-
lated issues campus-wide. 
To promote some of this 
much-needed discourse 
about social justice, Duncan 
hopes that the “State of the 
University” series “will grow 
a bit more and include even 
more diversity, so we can all 
learn something new at each 
discussion.” The night’s con-
sensus was that Carnegie 
Mellon students, faculty, and 
staff may not be able to take a 
knee, but they can de?nitely 
take a seat and start engaging 
in this conversation.
and Senior Research Scholar, 
Lugene Bruno and Assistant 
Curator of Art, Carrie Roy. 
It’s an extensive process that 
takes place over a two-year 
period, and its outcome re-
?ects one of the most diverse 
and talented collection of bo-
tanical art ever. According to 
the Hunt Institute’s website, 
“Collectively, the catalogues 
are the most comprehensive 
record available of 20th–21st-
century botanical artists and 
illustrators — the number of 
individuals represented now 
totals 1,129.”
The selection process be-
gins with open submission 
of works from anyone. Some 
of the artists have never been 
heard of by the curators, 
while others have been, and 
others come recommended. 
Some of the art also comes 
from artists that Bruno and 
Roy have watched evolve 
throughout their careers, 
who are then asked to sub-
mit their art to be featured 
in the international exhibit. 
Roy mentioned that because 
an artist can only be featured 
in the international exhibit 
once, it’s important to pick 
the artists that they think 
are most ready, to avoid hav-
ing someone display their 
work before the peak of 
their career.
Each artist digitally 
submits what they believe to 
be their top three pieces. Bru-
no and Roy select artists that 
will be featured in the exhibit 
and narrow it down from the 
three pieces they’ve submit-
ted to the one that they would 
be most interested in seeing 
for the exhibit. Once it’s been 
decided which pieces are best 
for the exhibit, the artists 
send in the physical piece for 
a ?nal approval. In prepar-
ing for the exhibit, all of the 
photography of the art and 
graphic design for the series 
is done in-house, which takes 
a lot of attention to detail to 
achieve a quality outcome.
This year’s exhibition 
includes art from 15 different 
countries, including the U.S., 
England, Scotland, Ireland, 
France, Italy, Spain, Austra-
lia, New Zealand, South Af-
rica, China, Japan, and South 
Korea. As in previous years, 
the submissions are heavily 
from the U.S. and Western 
Europe, but there has been a 
growing presence of submis-
sions from countries in Asia 
as well.
The most common 
medium for the art is wa-
tercolor, though many art-
ists also use colored pen-
cils, ink, powder pastels, or 
powder graphite. This year, 
there is a lot more work 
featuring colored pencils.
What inspires Bruno most 
about the international ex-
hibit is searching for artists 
that are pushing the bound-
aries of what is botanical 
art, while still showing ap-
preciation and understand-
ing for what the purpose of 
botanical art is. For example, 
though it is traditional for 
the background of the art 
to be white, Bruno pointed 
out that several pieces in 
this year’s international ex-
hibit use a combination of 
artistic mediums, but didn’t 
follow the rules surround-
ing background. One piece 
resembled a photograph, 
with shadowing on the white 
background. Another imple-
mented a desert landscape as 
a background, something not 
commonly seen in botanical 
art.
When asked what her 
favorite piece in the exhibit 
this year was, Roy explained 
that given the complexity of 
emotions expressed in each 
piece, depending on the day, 
one piece will stand out more 
than another, but she could 
never pick an absolute favor-
ite. This really speaks to the 
beauty of botanical art, as  
humanity’s attempt to cap-
ture the pure beauty of the 
organic world, something 
that we can relate to more 
deeply than the material 
world around us.

As much as we all love Pinter-
est and YouTube tutorials, there are 
some things that most people agree 
shouldn’t be DIY. Normally medical 
treatment, devices, and equipment 
are near the top of that list, but in the 
wake of extreme price hikes EpiPens 
seem to have fallen off the list all 
together. Surging EpiPen kit prices, 
which have spiked from around $100 
in 2009 to over $600 today, have 
forced some people to start making 
their own, using materials that cost 
between $8 and $35.
There has been a lot of outrage 
about the price hikes, with have been 
happening yearly since the pharma-
ceutical company Mylan bought the 
rights to the product in 2007. The 
latest price increase in May of this 
year brought the price from $461 
to $608.61 and drew attention and 
criticism from the media and Con-
gress. Using words like “sickening” 
and “disgusting,” the House Over-
sight and Government Reform Com-
mittee berated Mylan’s CEO Heather 
Bresch about the EpiPen’s pricing 
in a hearing that was surprisingly 
bipartisan. It turns out demonizing 
Big Pharma is one of the few things 
that can break the gridlock in Wash-
ington. But as much fun as it is to 
crucify big, greedy corporations, the 
situation is, as usual, a lot more com-
plicated than that.
Firstly, it’s important to un-
derstand how that $608 price tag 
is distributed.
On the supplier end, Mylan 
claims to only get $274 from each 
sale, with the rest going to distribu-
tors and middlemen. Of that $274, 
only $100 is pure pro?t. Besides the 
long line of middlemen and the cost 
of the supply chain, pharmaceuti-
cal companies also have to invest in 
research and development, which is 
an absurdly costly yet vital portion 
of their business. Without robust re-
search and development programs 
medicine would stagnate, and vital 
improvements and medicines might 
never be developed. Since acquiring 
the EpiPen in 2007, Mylan claims to 
have spent nearly $1 billion on re-
search and development.
On the buyer side of the equation, 
the price to the consumer really de-
pends on their individual insurance 
plan. Some plans cover the complete 
cost of the EpiPen so the consumer 
pays nothing, while people with no 
insurance or high deductible plans 
can end up paying the full price.
The Affordable Care Act helped 
dramatically decrease the number 
of uninsured people, hitting a record 
low of 8.6 percent in September, but 
a lot of people who were previ-
ously uninsured opted for high-
deductible plans that leave 
them just as vulnerable to 
the price hikes. According 
to CNBC, in the ?rst three 
months of this year 40 per-
cent of nonelderly people 
with private health cover-
age were enrolled in a high-
deductible plan. People who 
opt for high deductible plans 
usually do so because they cannot 
afford the more thorough plans with 
higher premiums, so the full $608 
price tag hits especially hard.
Mylan has taken some 
steps to try and miti-
gate the impact of the 
price hikes, offering a 
$300 savings card for 
customers who have 
to pay the full price of 
the drug and announc-
ing the release of a generic 
version of the EpiPen that will 
cost $300. However, the use of the 
savings card is illegal in programs 
such as Medicare and unavailable to 
the uninsured. Mylan holds a patent 
for the EpiPen’s release device that 
prevents other companies from pro-
ducing pens that use the same easy-
to-use device that can save lives. 
The new generic version will still 
be a Mylan product, perpetuating 
Mylan’s stranglehold on the EpiPen 
market. There is no reason to believe 
that the generic’s price will stay at 
$300 when Mylan has a monopoly.
The problem of EpiPen prices, 
and the countless other drugs that 
have the same story, is a sticky one 
with no easy solution. On one hand, 
pharmaceutical companies are, in 
the end, companies. They need the 
motivation of pro?t to function and 
keep improving. Pharmaceutical 
companies drop hundreds of mil-
lions of dollars on developing new 
drugs and equipment, and they rely 
on patent protections and high pric-
es to make that investment worth it. 
On the other hand, this lifesaving 
medication is becoming unafford-
able for the people who need it.
The solution seems to be in-
creased negotiation and transpar-
ency. It’s worth noting that while 
EpiPens are used around the word, 
the United States is the only coun-
try having this problem. EpiPens in 
Canada still cost about $100. This 
discrepancy seems to exist because 
the Canadian government negoti-
ates and regulates medicine price 
increases; something the United 
States government is prohibited 
from doing. 
While in theory allowing the free 
market to run should be optimal, 
judging by the current situation this 
isn’t working. The arti?cial monopo-
ly created by the long patent period 
makes it impossible for the free mar-
ket to function and set a competitive 
price for medicine.
It seems like the best solution 
would be for the government to be 
able to ne-
gotiate and 
yes maybe 
regulate 
prices 
while the 
pat-
ent is in effect. That way prices could 
be set at a level that would recoup 
pharmaceutical companies for their 
costs while making sure they aren’t 
price gouging people who desper-
ately need the medicine. 
When the House Oversight and 
Government Reform Committee 
requested a breakdown of Mylan’s 
research and development costs for 
last year, the company was unable to 
oblige. While research and develop-
ment are undeniably important, they 
shouldn’t serve as a reason to give 
drug companies a blank check. Ide-
ally, this kind of information should 
be public record or at least available 
to the government so they can moni-
tor the companies for price gouging.
Another commonly cited reason 
for high drug prices is the long line 
of middlemen between the supplier 
and consumer. These middlemen are 
mostly pharmacy bene?t managers, 
who help market and sell the drug in 
exchange for a rebate from the drug 
company. These middlemen make 
for a long and complicated of people 
that siphon off the pro?ts made from 
the sale of a medicine. To compen-
sate for the money that gets diverted 
to these pharmacy bene?t managers, 
the drug companies hike up prices. 
If the government was able to pre-
vent them from taking this easy way 
out and raising prices, they would 
be forced to restructure the supply 
chains to be more pro?t ef?cient.
The recent EpiPen price scandal is 
a perfect example of how our phar-
maceutical industry is broken. While 
there are several Band-Aid solutions 
on the table for this instance, like re-
leasing a generic version or putting 
EpiPens on the list of preventative 
medicine insurance companies are 
required to cover, it’s time we looked 
more deeply into the problems with 
the industry as a whole. It’s time for 
an overhaul.

CALEB GLICKMAN
At long last, we have arrived at 
our current election. After discussing 
our two-party system with regards 
to history, media, and math, we can 
?nally address the slow car crash un-
folding in front of us. And for Gary 
Johnson and Jill Stein fans who have 
stuck with me this long — bear with 
me, I haven’t forgotten about you.
First however, we must discuss the 
two main party’s nominees: Former 
Secretary of State Hillary Clinton 
and business tycoon Donald Trump. 
This is the ?rst time in history when 
both nominees are the most dis-
liked candidates ever nominated by 
their party.
Let’s start with Clinton. As a long-
serving Democrat at many levels of 
government, she is truthfully 
the most quali?ed person 
to run for president. To 
many, she epitomizes the 
party establishment.
Trump, on the other 
hand, is everything Clinton is 
not. He is a real-estate owner who 
has boosted his brand over the past 
decade with his shows like The Ap-
prentice and buildings with his name 
on them. He used his 
outsider status 
to launch 
him 
over the huge GOP primary ?eld, 
dominating media coverage with 
outrageous statements.
I would like to brie?y address the 
idea of an outsider. Oftentimes, a 
portion of the electorate gets the no-
tion that someone outside of the po-
litical realm will “shake things up” in 
Washington. While the sentiment of 
this is sound, based on the idea that 
anyone can become president, the 
last person you’d want in the Oval 
Of?ce is someone who doesn’t know 
how to do the job.
If you were a boss hiring for a 
job, and someone applied from a 
completely different ?eld, with no 
applicable skills, you would dismiss 
him immediately. The presidency is 
the most powerful, dif?cult job in the 
world. No amateurs allowed.
This brings me to my main point 
about this election cycle: Trump has 
upended the two-party balance. He 
has taken a major party of generally 
conservative opinion and molded 
it into his personal one-man cult of 
personality. While he has hijacked 
the presidential race, social conser-
vatives, a minority in the party, have 
hijacked the party platform, turning 
out something similar to The Book of 
Revelations. The party’s many prin-
cipled moderate conservatives are 
no longer represented. This is prob-
lematic because for the ?rst time in 
many election cycles, the contest is 
not between two sets of values; one 
side is represented by a man who is 
not truly a Republican.
The closest anyone can come 
to ?nding a precedent for Trump’s 
campaign is that of George Wal-
lace and the American 
Independence Party. Wallace, or Mr. 
Segregation as I referred to him last 
week, ran as a strict segregationist. 
His rallies drew thousands of sup-
porters, he often encouraged violent 
responses to protesters, he criticized 
the media and political elite, and was 
hailed as an outsider. The similarities 
are striking, except that Trump has 
been nominated by a major party, not 
a protest party. This makes him even 
more dangerous, since his appeal is 
truly national and he has a chance 
of getting elected, whereas Wallace’s 
support was concentrated mostly in 
the South.
Many of us who watched the de-
bate on Monday can agree that there 
is no comparison between our two 
main candidates. While Clinton has 
her share of campaign problems, 
they pale in comparison to Trump’s. 
She came prepared and remained 
fairly composed for the debate, 
while Trump touted his tempera-
ment through his constant interrup-
tions and interjections. He was easily 
provoked and could not keep up in 
a policy discussion without revert-
ing to the same, often nonsensical, 
talking points he has used for over 
a year now. It was the ?rst time we 
saw these two onstage together, and 
Trump’s obnoxious behavior and 
general unpreparedness exposed yet 
again how unquali?ed he is.
Toward the end of the debate the 
candidates were asked whether they 
would honor the result of the elec-
tion. Both said that they would do so, 
but the question had only truly been 
directed at Trump. He has openly 
questioned the validity of the elec-
tion and occasionally said that it 
could be rigged against him. 
This issue transcends the 
partisan divide; this type 
of comment has danger-
ous implications. If his-
tory is any indication, he 
will probably make com-
ments like this again in the 
future, despite saying he would 
respect the result.
Should the election be decided 
by a handful of states, it is with-
in the realm of possibility 
that Trump would contest 
the election if he loses. 
Even if he is defeated, 
he will remain in the 
national media spot-
light, perhaps 
preparing for 
his next run 
in four 
years. However, there is a solution to 
this potential problem.
Trump needs to be eviscerated. 
Completely destroyed. It cannot 
even be close. If Clinton wins in a 
landslide, he will have no justi?able 
reason to contest the result and his 
hateful, fear-mongering campaign 
will fade away. To accomplish this, 
though, Clinton will need everyone’s 
help. Complacency is the enemy; 
Trump is counting on progressives to 
stay home.
Now, to my conservative friends 
who feel abandoned by their party, 
I ask you for your help. If we band 
together and send Trump back into 
the abyss of reality television, per-
haps we can restore some sanity to 
our politics. Still, some of you may 
be considering voting for Johnson 
(or for some of my friends on the left, 
Stein). For those who have not heard 
about Johnson, he is the nominee 
of the Libertarian Party, running a 
campaign that is, in a nutshell, eco-
nomically conservative and socially 
liberal.
The Johnson campaign’s strat-
egy is to woo voters who are equally 
dissatis?ed with both major party 
candidates. This approach, called 
Balanced Rebellion, relies on the 
narrative that neither Clinton or 
Trump is deserving of support. This 
is completely misguided.
As I said earlier, Clinton has some 
issues, but to equate her with an ig-
norant, boorish, sexist, compulsive 
bullying liar who is also a terrible 
businessman, is simply incorrect. 
And when Trump displays his fond-
ness for authoritarian tactics, such as 
encouraging violence, fanning rac-
ism and xenophobia by blaming en-
tire groups of people or religions for 
complicated problems, or censoring 
the press, the American people need 
to show him that our country will not 
tolerate it.
Moderate conservatives, I will be 
perfectly honest with you. If John-
son/Weld (or maybe Weld/Johnson) 
were running as the GOP ticket, the 
Democrats would be terri?ed. Their 
ideology seeks to build a different co-
alition than the current Trump GOP, 
one that would draw voters away 
from the Democrats. 
Some conservatives may be unsat-
is?ed with my suggestion, but if you 
can achieve a shift back to the center 
like the ones Democrats achieved in 
the 1990’s, you will be able to elect 
a Republican to the presidency in the 
future.
Johnson is by no means a per-
fect candidate either (e.g., Alep-
po), but his ideology is the one 
that would allow the GOP to func-
tion as a real party again, instead 
of the megaphone for the reli-
gious right and the Trump family.
Now, I would be remiss if I did 
not mention Stein of the Green 
Party. I am not going to attack her or 
her beliefs: rather, I will tell you ex-
actly what they are. She believes in 
becoming a 100 percent renewable 
energy country by 2030. She wants 
to forgive all student debt, an appeal-
ing but not particularly liberal pro-
posal. She wants to break up the big 
banks, without a clear alternative to 
what would replace them. As a doc-
tor, she has said that Wi-Fi is a threat 
to children’s health, has endorsed ho-
meopathic remedies, and has had to 
walk back comments that seemed to 
suggest that vaccines might cause au-
tism (they don’t). She has also never 
held public of?ce.
If either the Libertarian or Green 
parties were particularly serious 
about breaking the two-party mold 
of our country, the presidential pro-
test vote is not the path for them. As 
we have discussed, running spoiler 
candidates in Presidential elections 
has worked to hurt the overall desires 
of the electorate as a whole. To cre-
ate a real base for another party, they 
would need to win local and state 
elections, giving them real support 
for being represented in Congress.
Each of these parties has its own 
dilemma. After this election, Liber-
tarians should take up the cause of 
moving the GOP towards its ideolo-
gy, making the GOP represent a more 
moderate (and electable) brand of 
conservatism. The Green Party, how-
ever, has already been mostly assimi-
lated into the values of the Democrat-
ic Party. For all those Bernie Sanders 
holdouts out there considering vot-
ing for Stein, take a read through the 
Democratic platform. Sanders’ in?u-
ence in the primary helped create the 
most progressive platform in history. 
Refusing to vote for Clinton at this 
point is the same as voting for Trump 
— don’t be the Ralph Nader voters of 
2016.
To ?nalize our journey through 
my defense of the two-party system, 
I would like to reiterate a lesson from 
the Founding Fathers, who were dis-
cussed back in week one. As much as 
they may have disliked parties, the 
system they set up works best when 
two main parties maintain the bal-
ance of power, instituting incremen-
tal change over time. If we can join 
together in resisting an extreme, un-
predictable demagogue, the Demo-
crats will be happy to begin compro-
mising again with the most-likely 
Republican-controlled House of Rep-
resentatives.
The only conclusion regarding 
our election is that it is in desperate 
need of a decisive statement by the 
American people. Anything less will 
not solve our long-term problems. 
We need an election that works to 
put us back on the track of sanity and 
compromise. The two-party system 
has worked in the past and can work 
again. All we have to do now is unite 
behind the banner of pragmatism 
and prove that the United States can 
resist the plagues of ignorance, preju-
dice and hatred.

Moderate Republicans have been 
decrying Donald Trump’s nomina-
tion as not only dreadful for the na-
tion, but also for the party in the 
upcoming election. While Trump’s 
candidacy may allow little hope for 
the country, there is a silver lining for 
the Republican Party; the dysfunc-
tion caused by its presidential candi-
date will improve the chances of its 
congressional candidates. In other 
words, Trump is good for his party 
because he is such a bad candidate.
This is because Trump will unwit-
tingly free up funding traditionally 
reserved for the presidential race, 
giving a boost to candidates ?ght-
ing elections for seats in Congress. 
Thus, the Republican Party will ac-
tually bene?t from Trump’s inability 
to raise funds. Since Trump is so un-
predictable, Republicans cannot feel 
secure knowing that he is the presi-
dent, because he may not support the 
policies they do. They will be better 
off supporting congressional candi-
dates with established beliefs and 
whom the party can at least some-
what control.
This is not to say that the Repub-
lican Party should surrender all hope 
of winning the presidency. Instead, 
Trump simply doesn’t need the party 
as much as presidential candidates 
have in years past. He gets a tre-
mendous deal of media coverage 
simply by opening his mouth and, 
often, simply by promising to open 
his mouth. This means that Trump 
doesn’t need much funding for his 
campaign. The purpose of campaign 
funds, to make a candidate better 
known and to deride his opponent, 
is already accomplished by having 
Trump as the candidate. From immi-
gration to trade, Trump and his views 
are widely known and his opponent’s 
misdeeds, whether it be with her 
email server or not doing enough to 
prevent the attacks in Benghazi, are 
well-documented.
Thus, the Republican Party can 
reduce spending on the presidential 
race without giving up on its can-
didate. This is fortunate, because 
the party may not have a choice, as 
more and more donors, like the Koch 
brothers, divert their money to con-
gressional races — particularly Sen-
ate races. Sheldon Adelson, for exam-
ple, recently donated $40 million to 
help Republicans in Senate elections, 
forgoing his earlier promise to donate 
$100 million to Trump’s campaign, as 
per a report in The New York Times. 
Since many current projections have 
the Republicans losing the Senate in 
November, this actually bodes well 
for the Republican Party.
By betting on multiple congressio-
nal races rather than frittering money 
away on one contest, Republicans are 
unwillingly making the smart deci-
sion, investing in contests in?uenced 
far more by money than presidential 
races are. This is because congressio-
nal candidates are generally not well-
known, so advertisements can have 
more of an impact on voters’ thinking 
in these races. Moreover, the law of 
diminishing marginal returns sug-
gests that since these contests see less 
total money, any money in the con-
test will be more effective. Thus, do-
nors will see greater returns on their 
investments while assuming less risk, 
as they will have spread their money 
out over multiple contests. This has 
already been seen in the race for Sen-
ate in Ohio, where Republican Rob 
Portman has jumped out to a huge 
lead in polls over his opponent Ted 
Strickland thanks in large part to the 
increased funding he has received in 
this election cycle, according to The 
New York Times.
A Trump candidacy will therefore 
help the Republican Party preserve 
its hold on the Senate. The counter-
argument goes that Trump will have 
a negative impact on voting down 
the ballot and will thus actually hurt 
candidates for congressional of?ce. 
While Trump’s high “unfavorable” 
ratings — consistently over 50 per-
cent in polling — would suggest that 
this would be the case, Hillary Clin-
ton’s similarly high unfavorability 
ratings mean that Independents who 
don’t want to vote for the party of 
Trump also won’t want to vote for the 
party of Clinton, thus negating the 
impact of Trump’s unpopularity. The 
ability of a presidential candidate to 
impact votes in other contests may 
be exaggerated anyways, as the 2012 
election showed that the electorate 
today is willing to split its ballot 
between the two parties.
So, with the lack of an in-
sidious effect down the bal-
lot and with a lesser need 
for funding, Trump gives 
the Republican Party the 
freedom to concentrate 
on congressional elec-
tions and protect its ma-
jorities in both hous-
es of Congress. 
The Democratic 
Party, on the 
other hand, ?nds defeating Trump to 
be its utmost priority since it believes 
a Trump presidency will be unimag-
inably harmful to the country’s prog-
ress. This means that it will focus its 
funds on the presidential election in 
the coming months, providing a per-
fect opportunity for Republicans to 
win the close congressional contests.
That’s why another argument, 
that Trump will energize the Demo-
cratic base to donate more money, 
fails in this case, as Democrats will 
spend to defeat Trump, not congres-
sional Republicans. Further, ener-
gizing the base will largely result in 
more small donations. Most money in 
congressional elections, on the other 
hand, comes from PACs and large do-
nations from individuals. When the 
powerful Republican donors focus on 
Senate races while Democratic do-
nors ?xate on the presidential race, it 
will create a funding imbalance that 
will be hard to overcome for Demo-
cratic candidates.
Congress is supposed to be just 
as powerful as the Executive, and 
Republicans would be better off aim-
ing to maintain that power 
in 2016, as they sort 
out how best 
to align the 
party’s two 
divergent 
economic interests: one populist and 
one demanding loose regulations 
and open trade. 
Focusing too much on the presi-
dency risks making the Republican 
Party nearly irrelevant in the federal 
government till 2018 and, more seri-
ously, splintering its base. Trump al-
lows the party to re?ect and reset for 
future elections while still controlling 
Congress. Trump has used the Re-
publican Party to 
promote him-
self; it’s time 
the party 
used him 
to protect 
its future.

Buzzword-filled ‘debate’ overshadows country’s real issues
For-profit prisons lead to injustice
EMILY GALLAGHER
Although there have been tre-
mendous strides in women’s rights 
in recent years, there is still a signi?-
cant amount of disparity in the way 
that men and women are perceived, 
particularly in the political world. A 
little under a century after women 
gained the right to vote, there is ?-
nally a real potential that we will 
elect our ?rst female president into 
of?ce.
At the same time, people on ev-
ery side, whether it be the press, 
the general public, or her opponent, 
are highly critical of things like her 
speech patterns, her clothing, and 
the way her hair is cut.
Since the 1960 Nixon-Kennedy 
election physical appearance has 
played an integral role in politics. 
The presidential debates of that 
election, which would make history 
for being the ?rst ones to ever be 
televised, held implications far be-
yond what anyone could have imag-
ined. Based on polls after the de-
bate, radio listeners believed it was 
a draw, where those who watched 
on television believed Kennedy won 
by a landslide. This vast discrepancy 
supposedly had to do with the di-
sheveled, exhausted appearance of 
Nixon as opposed to the well com-
posed, clean cut appearance of Ken-
nedy. This is a pretty good argument 
considering the vast difference be-
tween radio listeners’ and television 
viewers’ perceptions.
With the era of the television at 
hand, physical appearance began to 
make a difference in things that ap-
pearance should have no weight in 
whatsoever. But this is the ?aw in 
humanity; despite every warning, 
we do judge a book by its cover.
Our culture places a tremen-
dous amount of emphasis on the 
physical attractiveness of a woman. 
This is evident in everything from 
magazine advertisements to the 
way women are depicted in ?lms. 
It shouldn’t come as a surprise that 
this same sexism that in?ltrates our 
media carries over to other realms.
I don’t care what your political 
af?liation is, or what your opinion 
of Hillary Clinton is, but the sex-
ist remarks she she has faced dur-
ing this race are despicable. These 
comments come from the public, 
from the press, and even her run-
ning opponent. Trump is the worst 
of all of them, dmaking comments 
like “I just don’t think she has a 
presidential look and you need a 
presidential look,” during an inter-
view with ABC. A ‘presidential look? 
What does a president look like? If 
we were to make the argument that 
to be president of the United States 
you must be an old, white, male the 
trend was broken long ago. Appear-
ance does not require the adjective 
“presidential” to qualify you for the 
job.
Similarly to appearance, the 
sound of one’s voice is absolutely 
no indication of the way someone 
would run a country. This is a partic-
ularly hot subject as after the debate 
last Monday Twitter was ?ooded 
by comments about the “shrill” na-
ture of Clinton’s voice. Even Trump 
joined in, describing Clinton’s voice 
as a “very average scream.” These 
things have absolutely no relevance 
in how ?t one is for the presidency.
Clinton recently released an ad-
vertisement which highlighted the 
countless things that Trump has said 
which degrade and shame woman 
for their physical appearance. The 
advertisement ends with the line “Is 
this the president we want for our 
daughters?” It is a campaign strate-
gy that is the perfect appeal to ethos. 
Any woman, or person for that mat-
ter, who watches that advertise-
ment will understand the emotional 
damage such objecti?cation of an-
other human being has on a person. 
People are not de?ned by what they 
look like and what they sound like, 
and neither are presidents.

Since the ?rst presidential de-
bate of 2016, the internet has been 
abuzz. Everyone, from media pun-
dits to Twitter a?cionados are try-
ing to decide which candidate won 
the debate: business tycoon Donald 
Trump or former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton.
While the winner isn’t clear, 
the loser is; every single one of us 
who tuned in, hoping that bring-
ing these two divisive candidates 
on the same stage would result in 
fascinating discussion.
Instead, there were only insults 
and witty comments. Entertaining, 
certainly, but not entirely helpful. Ev-
ery single scandal that has occupied 
the media for weeks came up. The 
debate was just the same points that 
Trump and Clinton have been mak-
ing for what seems like eternity.
At this point in the election, all of 
these scandals are old news. We’ve 
heard about Judge Gonzalo Curiel 
and the Khan family. We’ve heard 
about the comments Trump has 
made about women. We’ve heard 
about Clinton’s emails for a long 
time, through hearings and inves-
tigations. These aren’t new scandals 
that people will be weighing at home. 
It’s fairly likely that anyone who was 
going to decide how they voted based 
on those comments and con?icts al-
ready knew about them. Most people 
have already made up their minds.
Both sides have made the same 
points again and again. And again. 
And this Monday, they drove them 
home yet again. These aren’t bad 
points. When electing the person 
who will represent this entire na-
tion, considering temperament and 
point of view and past mistakes are 
all important. 
These points shouldn’t be ignored. 
For many people, these are the issues 
that helped them decide their vote. 
But focusing so much time on them 
is neither necessary nor productive.
Its been many, many months since 
this election started. There is an 
unprecedented number of undecided 
voters right now. At this point, those 
undecided voters have already heard 
about each politician’s scandals. 
Those biting comments aren’t going 
to convince anyone of anything. The 
two potential leaders of this country 
had the chance to really talk about 
policy, and it just didn’t happen.
The number of witty comments 
you make about your opponent 
shouldn’t in?uence how we de-
scribe your performance. The next 
president doesn’t need to make 
snide remarks to world lead-
ers. The president needs to 
understand policy, law, 
and international issues. 
We let politicians 
in these debates  
command atten-
tion with these 
comments, and ignore actual issues.
This debate was full to the brim 
with buzzwords and phrases that 
poll well. Clinton used the ones that 
liberals love, like “having the wealthy 
pay their fair share and close the 
corporate loopholes,” and “strong 
growth, fair growth, sustained 
growth.” Trump focused on all 
his greatest hits, like bashing 
Mexico, making America 
great again, and insulting 
President Barack Obama.
To call what happened on Mon-
day night a debate is, quite frankly, 
a stretch. It involved two people 
talking at or over each other. This 
was not discourse of ideas, but a rep-
etition of the things that have gotten 
them this far. 
The same points that have 
made up stump speeches 
were regurgitated on stage, 
repackaged for primetime 
drama.
At the end of the day, 
many of the voters that 
haven’t made up their 
mind yet aren’t just un-
decided. They’re unhap-
py with the choices they 
are left with for this 
election. Some are 
struggling 
between 
voting 
third party or for a major party can-
didate. Others are wondering is vot-
ing is worth it at all. The voters that 
needed this debate to make up their 
mind weren’t give much to work 
with.
If the goal of this debate was to 
show the depth of these candidates to 
win over undecided voters, it didn’t 
happen. There simply wasn’t enough 
substance.
To be fair, both politicians did 
bring policies. They did bring up 
their plans for the country. But they 
did so in a way that was meant to be 
palatable, not thought-provoking.
Furthermore, the candidates 
weren’t the only ones bringing up old 
issues that garnered media attention. 
The moderator, Lester Holt, brought 
up many of them himself, including 
Trump’s previous questioning of the 
President’s citizenship. 
These questions, while not unim-
portant, did derail from discussions 
about things like racial tensions in 
the United States. They weren’t nec-
essary, at least not at the expense of 
policy talk. They certainly should not 
have been brought up by the modera-
tor.
Holt also let the discussion fall 
apart from its structure. A segment 
on the Iraq war turned into a conver-
sation about who has the better tem-
perament. The actual issue at hand 
was completely forgotten. 
Perhaps more guidance would 
have allowed for stronger discussion. 
Holt’s acceptance of off-topic talking 
points was ultimately only a detri-
mental.
In the end, this was the ?rst of 
three debates. We can only hope 
that by the next one, even the candi-
dates will be sick of bringing up each 
other’s scandals relentlessly and will 
choose to focus on policy. 
Without concrete discussion, ask-
ing voters to change their mind is an 
unfair burden. 
We deserve real discourse on the 
future of this nation, because casting 
a ballot to decide that future without 
adequate information isn’t a choice 
any of us should want to make.

You’re exhausted. You just got 
done working for the day. You aren’t 
blessed with a desk job, your work 
is manual labor. The only thing that 
got you through today was this mo-
ment right now — waiting in line for 
the money you earned after a hard 
day. You smile as you walk up to the 
man, tell him your hours for the day, 
and watch as he drops a whopping 
17 cents into the palm of your hand.
I didn’t just describe a third world 
country, or a western nation prior 
to labor laws. The exact scenario 
described above is an everyday re-
ality for inmates at for-pro?t pris-
ons. The United States prison sys-
tem is inherently ?awed, both with 
mass incarceration and inhumane 
living conditions.
With the United States represent-
ing only ?ve percent of the world’s 
population, it is completely ridicu-
lous that around 22 percent of the 
total prisoners in the world are sta-
tioned in prisons within the United 
States. 
In fact, in some parts of the Unit-
ed States, there are more people in 
prison than in college. The United 
States isn’t within the top 30 coun-
tries with the highest crime index, 
so the mass incarceration 
speaks to a much larger problem 
with the American prison system.
About 1 in 5 incarcerated people 
are locked up for a drug offense, and 
drug offenses are most prominent in 
incarcerated people within federal 
prisons. With many Americans be-
lieving that the federal prisons house 
too many offenders, these statistics 
should be an outrage to the public. 
There are people whose only 
crime was a drug offense sharing a 
?oor with murderers. The goal of 
prisons should be to rehabilitate 
members of society, not merely a 
punishment. But we cannot as a so-
ciety expect those with minor infrac-
tions to rehabilitate properly when 
we clump them together with the 
worst, most deplorable members 
of society.
The United States prison system 
also has some interesting institutions 
within it, deemed for-pro?t prisons. 
Prisons are an extension of govern-
ment, and “for-pro?t” should never 
be an adjective that can be reason-
ably used to describe a government 
institution or agency. But, shocking-
ly, it is, and these institutions have 
some of the most inhumane condi-
tions to be associated with a democ-
racy. Last week, an inmate posted a 
video of maggots squirming around 
his prison 
food. 
These conditions are so barbaric that 
the United States’ won’t even let the 
United Nations properly investigate 
its prisons.
The for-pro?t prisons in the 
United States operate by having in-
mates complete tasks for private 
businesses, and then paying these 
inmates outrageously low amounts 
for their labor. For about six hours of 
work, an inmate could be paid only 
17 cents. A part of the rehabilitation 
process reasonably could be requir-
ing inmates to work, but they would 
be fairly compensated upon their 
release. And this work could be fo-
cused on bettering the public by hav-
ing inmates work on the construc-
tion of public roadways, government 
buildings, public facilities, and many 
other options.
For-pro?ts are a disgrace to our 
country. Fortunately, inmates within 
these prisons have begun to protest 
these conditions. The mass media 
has turned a blind eye, but these 
protests are continuing in prisons 
throughout the country. Whether 
these protests will be a success re-
mains undecided, but there is hope 
for our prison system.
Many communities across the 
country have acknowledged the 
faults of our current prison system 
and are enacting changes. Cities 
across the country have enacted dif-
ferent initiatives focused on rehabili-
tating prison inmates. Rehabilitation 
has been proven in other countries 
to be successful at deterring 
crime, so it is refreshing to 
see that we’ve begun to 
take steps in the right di-
rection.
But at the end of 
the day, the United 
States still has a 
large issue with 
mass incarcera-
tion and our 
prison conditions 
are downright 
embarrassing 
for a democracy. 
These prisoners 
are people, and de-
served to be treated 
as such. 
Once the govern-
ment and the public 
?nally acknowledge the 
faults within the prison 
systems, we can begin to 
take steps that reduce crime 
and repeat offenders in America, 
and make the United States a safer 
place for everyone.

Nerve implants help paralyzed patients pedal
Michael McClellan, who 
became paralyzed from the 
hip down after a biking acci-
dent damaged his T11 verte-
brae in 2009, is now undergo-
ing a two-hour daily cycling 
regimen to prepare for the 
world’s first Cybathlon this 
October, an Olympics-style 
competition for people with 
bionic equipment.
In 2011, McClellan 
underwent surgery to implant 
functional electronic stimula-
tion technology. There are 16 
silicon electrodes implanted 
near his nerve endings, and 
when the central stimulator 
sewn into his abdomen turns 
the electrodes on, they supply 
a current of electricity to his 
muscles.
Ron Triolo, executive 
director of the Advanced 
Platform Technology Center 
at the Department of Veter-
ans Affairs in Cleveland, said, 
“It’s about triggering the right 
muscles in the right sequence 
to generate a pedaling motion 
in the paralyzed rider. It’s very 
simple for the user, but very 
complicated in a way that’s 
hidden in the technology.”

Universal flu vaccine designed by scientists
An international team of 
scientists has developed a vac-
cine that can combat up to 88 
percent of known flu strains 
worldwide. 
The team spanned across 
the universities of Lancaster, 
Aston, and Complutense in 
Madrid.
The scientists have also 
developed a vaccine specific to 
the United States that combats 
95 percent of known strains 
specific to the country. 
The vaccines contain 
epitopes, short flu virus frag-
ments that our immune system 
already recognizes, that reach 
full population coverage.
“Based on our knowledge 
of the flu virus and the human 
immune system, we can use 
computers to design the com-
ponents of a vaccine that gives 
much broader and longer-
lasting protection,” said Dr. 
Derek Gatherer of Lancaster 
University, one of the principle 
researchers for the project.
The research was published 
in the journal Bioinformatics.

Rosetta spacecraft lands on comet, ending mission
The comet orbiter Rosetta 
has landed on comet 67P/
Churyumov-Gerasimenko, 
ending its 26-month mission. 
Before it shuts down, 
Rosetta is equipped with a 
camera that will gather data 
and take incredibly detailed 
pictures of the comet.
Rosetta arrived at 67P on 
August 6, 2014 after spending 
nearly 10 years in space. 
Three months later, a 
lander Philae dropped to the 
comet’s surface after detach-
ing from Rosetta. 
The rough landing caused 
Philae to rest in the shadow 
of a cliff, and with insufficient 
light to charge its battery it 
went to sleep.
Rosetta has made great 
contributions to the scientific 
community regarding com-
ets, such as the discovery that 
comets have a much more dy-
namic surface than many oth-
er surfaces in the solar system 
and that the ratio of deuterium 
to hydrogen in 67P’s water is 
three times that on Earth.

Bumblebees react positively to water laced with sugar
Although we automatically 
assume bees are happy when 
they buzz around flowers, 
there is now research to back 
it up. In a new study, scien-
tists shook bees up vigorously 
for 60 seconds and monitored 
their actions. The bees that 
were more annoyed made 
poorer decisions when forag-
ing for food.
The study was lead by Clint 
Perry, a neuroethologist at 
Queen Mary University of Lon-
don. In addition, the research 
team trained 35 bees to navi-
gate a course with tunnels; if 
the tunnel was marked with 
a blue flower, there was sugar 
water at the end. If the tun-
nel was marked with a green 
flower, there was no reward.
When the tunnel became 
marked with a flower con-
taining both blue and green 
hues, the bees that were in-
centivized with sugar water 
before were quicker to enter 
the tunnel. Since both groups 
of bees flew the same distance 
and speed, it was attributed 
to a more optimistic, positive 
attitude. 
The study was published in 
the journal Science.

Mend major injuries with 3D printed bones
Recently, researchers from 
Northwestern University have 
created “hyperelastic bone” 
that can be 3D printed and 
work just as well as real bone. 
The bone is a scaffold made 
with hydroxyapatite – a natu-
rally occurring mineral in 
bone, polycaprolactone – a 
biocompatible polymer, and a 
solvent.
This mixture creates the 
ink that is dispensed by the 
printer. The idea is that a pa-
tient who had a bad break 
would be x-rayed and a bone 
scaffold could be printed in 
the same day. Since the ink 
contains compounds com-
monly found in labs, it would 
be cheap to print and scaffolds 
could be produced quickly.
“We’re printing flexible 
scaffolds that will encourage 
bone to grow through and 
around them,” said Ramille 
Shah, a material science en-
gineer and co-author on the 
study. 
So far, the researchers have 
used this hyperelastic bone to 
fuse two vertebrae in rats and 
to repair a macaque monkey’s 
damaged skull.

Tree frog species has entered extinction
The world’s last Rabbs’ 
fringe-limbed tree frog, 
Toughie, recently passed away 
at the Atlanta Botanical Gar-
den. He was collected in 2005 
when he was an adult, so he 
was at least 12 years old.
The Atlanta Botanical Gar-
den and Zoo Atlanta collected 
Toughie in a mission to rescue 
tree frogs when the deadly 
chytrid fungus closed in on 
central Panama.
This death sends the 
species Ecnomiohyla rabborum 
into extinction. 
“A lot of attention had 
been paid to him in captiv-
ity, so he even has his own 
Wikipedia page,” said Mark 
Mandica, head of the Amphib-
ian Foundation. 
“But there are plenty of 
other species out there that 
are disappearing, sometimes 
before we even knew that they 
were there,” Mandica said.

Soccer and science create the ultimate team dynamic
EVANGELIE LIU
Staffwriter
At first glance, the words 
“soccer” and “science,” or 
“soccer” and “biology,” seem 
to have little in common. 
But for soccer teammates 
and biology majors Samantha 
Smith, Haili Adams, and 
Nicole Winegardner, a senior 
and two juniors respectively, 
the skills learned when playing 
on Carnegie Mellon’s women’s 
varsity soccer team help de-
velop the skills required when 
working in Professor Jonathan 
Minden’s biology lab.
Teamwork is a skill critical 
on the field and in the lab, 
where the athletes work with-
in a 12-person “Proteomics 
Platoon,” whose main goal 
is analyzing various protein 
changes, which can be applied 
in research on cancer and 
other chronic diseases. 
The research team uses 
two-dimensional gel electro-
phoresis and fluorescent color-
ing to detect minute differenc-
es in various kinds of proteins, 
and these differences could 
help people pinpoint proper-
ties that could signify disease. 
This method works by apply-
ing electricity to move the 
negatively-charged proteins 
or other molecules through 
the gel medium, and this sepa-
rates out the molecules by size 
because shorter and smaller 
molecules move through the 
porous medium faster. 
In the case of the 
Proteomics Platoon’s research, 
the proteins of different cell 
extracts are first color-coded 
using fluorescent chemistry, 
then mixed and run through 
the gel medium. 
Proteins found in both 
samples would appear yellow 
while proteins in only one of 
the extracts would appear as 
red or green. 
This method has been used 
to detect protein changes in 
areas ranging from fruit fly 
embryo development to yeasts 
and cancer cells. Experiments 
frequently take a while to fin-
ish, which makes collabora-
tion all the more essential — 
and for Smith, that’s where 
being together on the same 
soccer team helps.
“Being on the same team 
on the field makes our rela-
tionship off the field so much 
stronger,” said Smith in an in-
terview with The Tartan.
To her, seeing Adams and 
Windegardner, who joined 
Professor Minden’s lab at her 
recommendation, following 
her footsteps in the lab and 
supplementing their academic 
work in biology by doing real-
world research is an incredibly 
rewarding experience. Com-
munication is an essential skill 
too, because ideas must flow 
around in order for research to 
run smoothly.
Besides teamwork and 
friendship, these three young 
women have benefited in other 
ways through the combination 
of research and soccer.
“We don’t have a lot of time 
during the day to waste, so 
when we get to running an ex-
periment we want to be as effi-
cient as possible,” Smith said.
Time management is 
crucial to ensuring that they 
can juggle classes, homework, 
soccer, and research all 
at once.
Another critical skill these 
young ladies take away from 
research is persistence.
“We need to be able to 
work through a lot of differ-
ent problems and trouble-
shooting to achieve our goal 
in biology, so continuously 
trying different approaches is 
necessary,” Smith said. 
The presence of difficulties 
is certain, but how a person 
handles it holds the key to 
success or failure.
But to Smith, the most 
important skill she has learned 
from her experience doing re-
search at Carnegie Mellon 
is curiosity.
“It is hard to ask questions 
because you don’t want to 
sound uninformed or feel inse-
cure about whether your ques-
tions are ridiculous,” she said, 
but learning how to be inquisi-
tive pays off because it opens 
one’s eyes to new perspectives 
in research. 
Smith says she is grateful to 
be part of the lab, and would 
“100 percent recommend” it 
to younger students to look 
for research opportunities, 
whether they are in athletics 
or not, because she “person-
ally believes that there is a lot 
to gain from doing field work 
outside of the classroom.”

PUGWASH
Scientists’ image reflected by the accuracy of their data
RUIHAO YE
Special to The Tartan
This week at Student 
Pugwash, the Science, Tech-
nology, and Society discussion 
club, we discussed the impor-
tance — or lack thereof — of 
the creation of a public image 
by scientists and the effects it 
can have on both the scientific 
community and the public. 
Specifically, we covered 
the topics of liability of 
scientists with regards to their 
results and the effects that 
they may hold, and how to 
educate the public about the 
process of scientific rigor and 
what it entails.
The events that were 
presented with regards to this 
topic were the charging of sci-
entists in Italy in 2009 with 
manslaughter with the misre-
porting of the probability of 
an earthquake, and the con-
fidence of British scientists in 
the lack of ability for Mad Cow 
Disease to spread to humans 
through infected beef before 
the disease leapt to humans.
The first of the topics 
examined was the role that 
uncertainty plays in the 
scientific community and the 
reporting of said aspect to the 
public. 
We considered the 
existence of error in sci-
entific reporting, and the 
characteristics of the in-
herent falsifiability of the 
scientific endeavor.
First, a member brought 
up the positive reporting bias 
in science, which led another 
student to bring up the topic 
of the creation of incorrect 
conclusions from poor ex-
perimental design and rigged 
result reporting, specifically 
treating such negligence as 
manslaughter. 
A different student 
proposed that scientists 
should be immune to the law 
and instead practice self-gov-
ernance through rigor in the 
publishing of papers. 
Another student proposed 
the promotion of the replica-
tion of scientific studies of 
particular interest.
From this topic we 
proceeded in addressing the 
liability — legal and social 
— when it comes to publiciz-
ing the conclusions to sci-
entific studies, specifically 
with comparing the reports

PUGWASH
Reporting scientific error could affect society’s trust
Number of women majoring in STEM fields is up at CMU
JOSH ANDAH
Staffwriter
This year, Carnegie Mellon 
University has moved closer 
to the ideal of gender equal-
ity. For the first time in the 
institution’s 116-year history, 
women make up almost half 
of the first-year students ad-
mitted into science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and math-
ematics (STEM) programs. 
The School of Computer 
Science is comprised of an as-
tonishing 48.5 percent wom-
en, while the College of Engi-
neering inches closely behind 
with 43.3 percent of its first-
years being female.
This feat is significant be-
cause it comes amid ailing 
admission rates for women in 
science and technology fields 
across the country. 
The national average for 
women in computer science 
and engineering is a meager 
20 percent. 
Moreover, this low per-
centage of American women 
in STEM fields in a univer-
sity reflects itself in the work 
force; although women make 
up half of employees in the 
U.S., they occupy less than 
25 percent of STEM job posi-
tions, according to a report by 
the United States Department 
of Commerce’s Economics 
and Statistics Administration.
Carnegie Mellon’s efforts 
to close the gender gap are as 
pertinent as ever. 
The university has imple-
mented middle and high 
school student programs, ju-
dicious admission processes, 
and empowering organiza-
tions to draw more women 
into STEM at the institution. 
Programs such as Creative 
Technology Nights for Girls, 
Summer Engineering Experi-
ences for Girls (SEE), and the 
Outreach Roadshow, ensure 
young girls are exposed to 
engineering early into their 
middle and high school life. 
It is this preconditioning 
that has allowed for more 
women in the class of 2020 to 
enroll into technical courses, 
including game theory and 
chemical engineering.
The admission process has 
also become far more solici-
tous with time. 
Looking at candidates 
with higher SAT scores and 
GPAs than ever before, ad-
missions officers had the 
challenge of cherry-pick-
ing the best students while 
ensuring minorities were 
not underrepresented.
However, the most pivotal 
aspect responsible for this 
achievement is a new mindset 
among faculty. 
Carol Frieze, a professor 
in the School of Computer 
Science, exemplifies this. She 
heads the organization Wom-
en@SCS, which opens doors 
for women across campus 
through networking. Noted in 
the press release of the book 
she co-authored with Jeria 
Quesenberry, Kicking Butt in 
Computer Science: Women in 
Computing at Carnegie Mel-
lon University, the increase in 
women in STEM is attributed 
to “changes in culture, not 
curriculum.” 
This change in culture 
breaks from the popular mis-
conception in academia “that 
you need to change the cur-
riculum to suit women … 
based on the idea that men 
and women relate to comput-
er science differently.”
Diversity in all forms is 
crucial. Engineering requires 
different perspectives, opin-
ions, and thinking to solve 
problems, according to Dean 
of the College of Engineering 
Jim Garrett. 
It also prevents the prolif-
eration of male-dominated 
work spaces in the future, 
which have the tendency to 
turn misogynistic.
The future of women in 
STEM has never been more 
promising. 
Thanks to changes taking 
place right here at Carnegie 
Mellon, we can confidently 
assert women will have a larg-
er role to play in the techno-
logical revolution that is the 
twenty-first century. 
With fewer women em-
ployed in STEM roles today as 
compared to numbers two de-
cades ago, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Class of 2020 is a step back in 
the right direction.
of scientists and potential 
failings to infrastructure de-
signed and built by designers 
and engineers.
At first, a Pugwash member 
proposed that similar to the 
punishment given out to de-
signers of poorly constructed 
buildings, scientists should be 
punished in accordance with 
that negligence. 
Another participant built 
off of that idea by proposing 
that the punishment only be 
in the case of bad data. For 
example, if a bridge were 
to be destroyed by a natural 
disaster, then the scientist 
should only be punished if the 
conclusion is based off of bad 
data.
As a counter to the 
comparison between engi-
neers and scientists, a differ-
ent student proposed that it 
would be hard to compare the 
roles of engineer and scientist, 
as engineers have codes and 
lists of requirements to follow 
that usually result in more 
predictable results, while sci-
entists are supposed to push 
boundaries with relatively 
unpredictable results. 
Furthermore, to address 
the subject of false reporting, 
the student also brought up 
the misreporting that occa-
sionally occurs with meteo-
rology scientists and whether 
or not said behavior should be 
punished as a result.
From here we returned to 
the reporting of the existence 
of scientific error and the ef-
fect it could have on societal 
trust in science. 
A student mentioned that 
the positions of celebrity sci-
entists, such as Bill Nye and 
Neil deGrasse Tyson, should 
be used to report on how to 
read science with regards 
to the existence of such 
error reporting.
Another student men-
tioned the role of the media 
in scientific reporting and 
proposed that the media is 
actually a neutral entity that 
can and actively does mislead 
people. 
To be specific, the student 
mentioned the use of press re-
leases and the mistranslations 
of scientific results in those 
press releases. 
Another member provided 
an example of when a re-
searcher simply worked in 
the normalization of data 
in a powerline study, and 
the media’s exaggerated 
and false conclusion of the 
results lead to him leaving 
Stanford under the pressure 
of power companies. 
A potential solution to this 
dangerous misrepresentation 
could be as follows: the media 
may create a story, but other 
media companies must work 
as a check on those stories.
At the end of the meeting, 
the general consensus was 
that the reporting of science 
to the media and the popu-
lace is marred with flaws and 
misunderstandings. 
But a different view, 
mentioned as a closing re-
mark, noted that a site de-
signed for the reporting 
of science in a media-like 
fashion exists where the ar-
ticles are written by scientists 
themselves. 
The existence of the site 
could be seen as a hopeful 
outlook on the relationship 
between scientists and public.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
is a summary of last week’s dis-
cussion on the liability of scien-
tists in regards to their results.

HOW THINGS WORK
NAVIYA SINGLA
Assistant SciTech Editor
What do the James Bond 
series, the Star Trek franchise, 
and even movies like Minor-
ity Report all have in com-
mon? They all show biometric 
authentication.
Biometric authentication 
is a method of security that is 
used to verify an authorized 
user’s identity using their 
physical features, such as 
thumb prints, retinal images, 
iris patterns and voice and 
speech patterns.
It is a commonly known fact 
that every human has unique 
fingerprints and handprints. 
However, people can also be 
uniquely identified based on 
the patterns of their retina, 
which is not be confused with 
iris-recognition.
Iris-recognition  to uses 
pictures of the patterns in 
the colored regions of the eye 
called the iris, while retinal 
patterns are basically the pat-
terns of the blood vessels in 
the retina. 
Since these blood vessels 
absorb light much better than 
the surrounding cells, they 
can be identified by measuring 
the light reflected back after 
appropriately shining light on 
the retina.
The procedure consists of 
shining a low-energy infra-
red light into the person’s eye 
and interpreting the received 
light as a digitized pattern. 
Then, the digitized pattern is 
compared to a patterns stored 
in the database to identify the 
person.
However, measurement 
accuracy can be affected by 
astigmatism, cataracts and 
glaucoma. 
Compared to fingerprint 
scanning, retinal patterns can 
change, even if they don’t 
change as often. In addition, 
retinal patterns cannot be 
altered intentionally, unlike 
fingerprints, which can be 
messed around with by burns, 
cuts, wounds, and sometimes 
even body lotion.
Retinal patterns differ in 
identical twins, much like 
fingerprints. Since neither 
of these characteristics are 
genetically determined, even 
identical twins who share 
their genetic make-up won’t 
break the retinal scanner.
Retinal scans are believed 
to be the second most secure 
biometric authentication 
method after DNA testing. As 
reported by the National Cen-
ter for State Courts, they have 
a reported failure rate of one 
in 10 million.
Despite their high accuracy 
rates, retinal scanners aren’t 
used very widely and are rela-
tively obscure. This is due to 
the fact that the retinal scan-
ning equipment is often very 
sophisticated and expensive, 
costing anywhere from $200 
to $4000.
Furthermore, retinal scans 
often feel ‘invasive’ to people. 
One reason for this could 
be because the preliminary 
scan to add someone to a da-
tabase can take a long time 
due to the multiple images 
that need to be taken. Also, 
depending on the sophistica-
tion of the system, the retinal 
scan confirmation could take 
varying times.
A common trope, as shown 
in movies, to beat retinal scan-
ners is to remove a person’s 
eyeball and then use that to 
gain unauthorized access. 
However, physiologically 
speaking, an eyeball, when 
removed from its socket 
and from the human body, 
immediately changes shape. 
If the shape of the eyeball 
changes, then the retinal pat-
terns also change. Therefore, 
actually removing the eyeball 
from someone’s socket is not 
the best way to bypass a retinal 
scan based security system. 
A better way would be to 
take a picture of their retina, 
and then replicate the retina 
in a suitable model to bypass 
the biometric security system.
Retinal scan authentication 
systems are currently used 
by several government agen-
cies, such as the FBI, CIA, and 
NASA. 
With enough funding and 
preparation, retinal scanners 
can become the norm for secu-
rity systems, helping to make 
our homes and work places 
more secure.
Bioauthentication reaches new levels with retinal scans

The Tartan fantasy football league heats up in Week 3
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Publisher
Hello, it’s me. I was wonder-
ing if after all these months 
you’ve missed getting your 
weekly fantasy football update 
from your old friend Sarah.
That’s right, I was the big-
gest loser last week. One of the 
Teams Foley got lucky when I 
made not just one or two bad 
bench calls, but four. Four bad 
calls that could have earned me 
an extra 50 points, saving me 
the humiliation of only scor-
ing 64 points. But hindsight is 
20-20, and the matchup was 
86–64.
Team Foley over McManus’s 
Anus 86–64
Remember how Panthers’ 
wide receiver Kelvin Benjamin 
was really great for two weeks 
in a row, raking in 21 and 29 
points for me in weeks one and 
two, respectively? And remem-
ber how I reached for legend-
ary Patriots’ tight end Gronk 
in the draft, and then he was 
injured for weeks one and two? 
Well, I started them both this 
week, then they both scored 
me a hard zero. So thanks for 
nothing, a-holes. Meanwhile on 
the bench I had QB Matt Staf-
ford with 26 points, and wide 
receiver Michael Crabtree with 
18. But I’m not bitter. Especially 
not about the part where Team 
Foley’s kicker Justin Tucker of 
the Ravens scored 17 points to 
McManus’s 5. That’s fine.
Dreamland Warriors over 
Masshole Knickerbockers 137-
86
Assistant Sports Editor Ian 
Tanaya’s Dreamland Warriors 
continue to make Kirby proud. 
Just among New Orleans QB 
Drew Brees, Bills’ running back 
Lesean McCoy, and Seahawks’ 
kicker Steven Hauschka, Tanaya 
raked in 64 points. Two thirds of 
his team scored double digits. 
Even though Beresford and the 
Masshole Knickerbockers had 
two awesome performances 
— 23 from Tampa Bay run-
ning back Charles Sims and 24 
from Jaguars wide receiver Al-
len Robinson — the rest of her 
lineup kind of crapped the bed. 
My thoughts are with you, Lula.
Mr. Rodgers’ Neighborhood 
over Plaidie Daddies 132-96
This was a juicy matchup. 
Best friend versus best friend. 
Jade versus India. Competi-
tion was intense. Operations 
Manager Jade Crockem sealed 
the deal as the only team with 
an undefeated record. She can 
send a major thank you to Aar-
on Rodgers, Green Bay QB and 
all-around babe, for his solid 
four touchdowns and 24 points, 
and Seahawks wide receiver 
Doug Baldwin who received 
for an actually astounding 164 
yards and 30 points. Online 
Editor India Price’s Emanuel 
Sanders, wide receiver for the 
Broncos, also had a pretty im-
pressive week, receiving for 117 
yards and raking in 32 points. 
But unfortunately, Price’s lineup 
didn’t have the depth we saw in 
Crockem’s, and Crockem con-
tinues to reign. If I were a bet-
ting woman, I’d put my money 
on her to stay undefeated an-
other week, as she only has Pill-
box Editor Abhishek Tayal and 
his team Minaj And Co. to beat. 
We just explained to him this 
past week what a “down” means 
in the context of this sport.
Team Foley over Minaj And 
Co. 131–119
I have to say how impressed 
I am that Team Foley has been 
so successful this season. And 
in week two, somehow four 
of Team Foley’s players scored 
more than 20 points (Rams’ run-
ning back Todd Gurley with 21, 
49ers running back Carlos Hyde 
with 25, Bears’ tight end Zach 
Miller with 27, and Falcons’ run-
ning back Devonta Freeman 
with 31). So basically I curse 
whatever deities exist for the 
unfairness that was this auto-
draft. 
Tayal and Minaj And Co. 
still had a pretty good week, 
though, I have to say. The Chiefs 
absolutely destroyed the Jets 
24–3 last week, so good thing 
Tayal started their D/ST for a 
total of 32 points. Dolphins’ 
wide receiver Jarvis Landry also 
brought in a solid 26 points, but 
in the end it didn’t matter. Too 
bad Tayal wasn’t playing the 
other Team Foley or he could 
have won, and I still would have 
lost anyway. Can you tell I’m 
bitter?
extremely dank team over 
Flaming Bears 144–143
I have to say this margin 
makes me laugh pretty hard at 
Layout Manager Zeke Rosen-
berg’s expense. Last week-
end his attention was pretty 
occupied by having to take 
the LSATs, so he forgot to put 
Green Bay wide receiver Jordy 
Nelson back into his starting 
lineup. So of course Nelson 
scored 28 points for the bench 
and Rosenberg soiled his un-
defeated record. I’m sorry, but 
ha-ha-ha-ha. Sports Editor Alex 
Wood’s extremely dank team 
can thank Colts’ wide receiver 
T.Y. Hilton for his exceptional 31 
points, but the rest of his team 
is still just pretty great - dare I 
say dank? I’m thinking I should 
propose a trade and throw in 
a couple of articles for his sec-
tion next week so try to get my 
hands on some actually suc-
cessful players. 
For week four, I’m excited 
to see how the inevitable Team 
Foley versus Team Foley epic 
matchup will go. My money is 
definitely on Team Foley! The 
only other matchup I’m re-
ally excited about is my own, 
against Rosenberg’s Flaming 
Bears, because as a wise friend 
once told me, “The most in-
teresting thing to talk about 
is your own fantasy team. The 
least interesting thing to listen 
to someone talk about is their 
own fantasy team.”
Women’s soccer drops first UAA competition to Brandeis
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s soccer team took the field 
on Saturday against the 10th 
ranked Brandeis University 
Judges. The Tartans fought a 
tough battle but ended fall-
ing 2–0, putting their record at 
6–3–1 on the season.
The game got off to a rough 
start for the Tartans. Halfway 
through the first minute, Tar-
tan goalkeeper Mia Keyser at-
tempted to pass the ball to 
one of her teammates but an 
opposing player intercepted 
it. The Brandeis player then 
sent the ball immediately over 
Keyser’s head and the Judges 
suddenly had a one score lead 
just as fast as the game had 
started.
The Tartans did not give 
up though. They continued 
to play aggressively and even 
got a chance to score in the 
ninth minute. Senior midfielder 
Delaney Lam made a shot but 
it was saved by the Brandeis 
goalkeeper. The Tartans were 
consistent in the offensive at-
tack but could never manage 
to finish the job. Sophomore 
forward Kaily Bruch had back-
to-back unsuccessful shot at-
tempts in the 33rd minute and 
the Brandeis defense looked 
to be unbreakable. The Tartans 
tried their best to make some-
thing happen but couldn’t find 
any momentum. 
The Judges finally put the 
nail in the coffin when they 
went on an offensive attack. A 
Brandies player sent the ball 
across the net to a teammate, 
who took the shot but it was 
knocked away by Keyser. An-
other Brandeis player collected 
the rebound and sent ball to 
the back of the net, putting the 
Judges up 2–0.
The Tartans never managed 
to find a way back into the 
game. Despite a couple close 
shots on goal in the second 
half, the Tartans found them-
selves unable to create any 
tangible offensive production, 
which is not usually the case.
If the Tartans want to win 
games in the future, they’ll 
need to be able to put points 
on the scoreboard. They had 
plenty of chances in this match, 
but couldn’t capitalize on any 
of them. This was only the first 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) competition for the Tar-
tans, so they’ll have plenty of 
time to bounce back in future 
games.
Even though they lost by 
two scores, the Tartans should 
be proud of the things they did 
right in this game. That said, 
they’ll also need to pinpoint 
their mistakes if they want to 
beat higher-ranked teams like 
Brandeis in the future.
The Tartans will travel to 
New York University for their 
next match on Saturday, Oct. 8. 
The game is scheduled to start 
at 11 a.m.

The Carnegie Mellon 
football team took on Bethany 
College on Saturday. The Tar-
tans defeated the Bison 49–26, 
taking their overall record to 
2–2 and their Presidents’ Ath-
letic Conference (PAC) record 
to 2–1.
The Bison started off with a 
long touchdown run that was 
called back due to a penalty. 
Junior outside linebacker Kyle 
Brittain recovered a fumble 
off a passing play, giving the 
Tartans the ball in Bethany’s 
territory. Junior quarterback 
Bryan Jangro returned to the 
field for the first time since 
his injury against Waynes-
burg two weeks ago. Junior 
wide receiver Alex Froimzon 
caught a ball deep around the 
goal line, and junior running 
back Sam Benger eventually 
punched it in, giving the Tar-
tans a 7–0 lead.
Bethany called up quite a 
few running plays, advanc-
ing to the Tartans’ side of the 
field. After getting into the 
red zone, the Tartans man-
aged a heavy hit that forced a 
fumble though Bethany was 
able to recover the ball. As 
Bethany approached the goal 
line, a lightning delay paused 
the game for 30 minutes. The 
Bison came out with a running 
play to the right that scored 
a touchdown but was called 
back due to a holding call. A 
few plays later, Bethany finally 
completed a touchdown pass 
to their tight end, tying up the 
score 7–7.
First-year running back 
William Richter returned the 
ensuing kickoff to their 45-
yard line. Benger ran the ball 
to the Bison side of the field. 
A great pass to junior wide 
receiver John Prather allowed 
him to get in position to get 
the ball to the goal line, and 
Benger brought it in a few 
plays later, putting the Tartans 
up 14–7.
The next drive saw the 
Tartan defense put a stop 
to the Bison offense, shut-
ting down an outside run on 
first down and taking down a 
quarterback draw two plays 
later. Richter returned the 
ensuing punt to the Bison 36-
yard line before the opposing 
punter managed to take him 
down. Jangro on the next play 
passed deep to Prather, con-
necting for a touchdown that 
put the Tartans up 21–7. Beth-
any started their next drive 
near midfield and quickly got 
a deep completion, scoring a 
touchdown but missing the 
extra point that took the score 
to 21–13. Richter took the en-
suing kickoff past midfield to 
end the first quarter.
In the second quarter, 
Benger took off for 49 yards 
to score a touchdown that put 
the Tartans up 28–13. Bethany 
attempted to even up the score 
quickly, but the Tartan defense 
was able to stop them in their 
tracks. 
The Tartan offense was 
pinned within their 20-yard 
line, and Jangro was unable 
to make a deep pass to junior 
wide receiver Tommy Man-
sfield due to the pressure of 
Bethany’s defense. On the 
next drive, Bethany was able 
to move the ball near midfield 
before the Tartan defense shut 
them down. The Tartan of-
fense went three and out, but 
the Bison returned muffed 
the punt, allowing senior 
cornerback Jonathan Dyer 
to recover the ball in the red 
zone. A few plays later, Jan-
gro completed a touchdown 
pass to Froimzon, putting the 
Tartans up 35–13. The next 
drive for Bethany saw them 
march to the other side of the 
field before a long completion 
resulted in a touchdown pass 
that brought the score to 35–
20. Sophomore running back 
Rory Hubbard returned the 
ball to the 48-yard line on the 
ensuing kickoff, but the Tar-
tans were unable to do much 
more after a miscommunica-
tion on third down led to Jan-
gro overthrowing his receiver. 
Junior punter and kicker 
Tyler Kohman pinned Bethany 
to their 5-yard line, forcing 
them to take a knee to end the 
half.
At the start of the third 
quarter, Bethany opted to 
make an attempt at an onside 
kick, but the Tartans managed 
to recover the ball. Benger 
made a few good running 
plays afterward. Unfortunate-
ly, a tipped pass allowed Beth-
any to make an interception, 
but the Tartan defense was 
able to keep them from doing 
much with the turnover. The 
Tartans went three and out, 
but the Tartan defense forced 
a three and out against the Bi-
son.
The next drive saw Prather 
haul in a pass that got the Tar-
tans into Bison territory before 
Prather caught a 41-yard pass 
for a touchdown, putting the 
Tartans up 42–20. Junior in-
side linebacker Sean Graff in-
tercepted the ball on Bethany’s 
next drive. On their next play, 
Benger took it to the house 
from 55 yards out, putting the 
Tartans ahead 49–20 before 
the end of the third quarter.
Despite the four score 
shortfall, Bethany came out 
swinging with a 33-yard run 
to start the fourth quarter. The 
Bison made it to the red zone, 
but the Tartans managed to 
stop them on fourth down. 
Sophomore quarterback Alex 
Cline took over on the next 
drive, but he threw an inter-
ception that was returned 
deep in Tartan territory. The 
Bison scored on the next play, 
bringing the score to 49–26 
after Bethany missed the extra 
point.
Bethany attempted another 
onside kick, but the Tartans 
recovered it. The offense went 
three and out, but the Tartans 
forced one against the Bison. 
The Tartans once again went 
three and out without taking 
much time off the clock. The Bi-
son tried to go for it on fourth 
and long, but the pass went 
incomplete. Junior quarterback 
Scot Beumel went in on the 
next drive, but spent his time 
handing the ball off to Richter. 
The Tartans brought the ball to 
the goal line before proceeding 
to run the clock out and end 
the game.
Both sides of the ball had 
their ups and downs during the 
game. The first quarter looked 
like the game would turn into a 
shootout before the Tartan de-
fense finally began figuring out 
how to stop the Bison. Beth-
any’s defense eventually put 
a hold on the Tartan offense, 
but it was too late for the Bison 
offense to catch up.
Senior defensive end Brian 
Khoury recorded 2.5 sacks to 
tie the record for most career 
sacks in Tartan history. Rich-
ter and Kohman were both 
instrumental in special teams 
dominance. Jangro looked 
much better in this game than 
he did the first two weeks, 
and Benger was able to break 
through many times. The Tar-
tans appear ready to take on 
any challenger.
The Tartans will next 
take the field at Washington 
and Jefferson University on 
Saturday, Sept. 8.
Volleyball starts UAA round robin play and falls at home
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s volleyball team began the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) conference play on Sat-
urday with a disappointing pair 
of losses. They were defeated 
by Washington University in St. 
Louis 3–1, and they also fell to 
the University of Chicago, 3–2. 
These losses moved the Tar-
tans to 15–4 on the season, but 
0–2 in UAA play.
In the match against 
Washington University in St. 
Louis, the Tartans dropped the 
first set 19–25 before reversing 
the score in the second set and 
evening the match at 1–1. The 
Bears went on to take the next 
two sets, 25–17 and 25–13.
Sophomore Lauren Mueller 
led the offense in the first 
match for the Tartans with 
13 kills. Senior Emily Newton 
recorded 32 assists and nine 
digs, while senior Molly Hig-
gins had 23 digs. Junior Eliza 
Donahue had two block as-
sists on top of five solo blocks. 
In the second match against 
Chicago, the Tartans dropped 
the first 25–22 and the second 
27–25. They rallied to win the 
third and fourth set 25–19 and 
25–17, but could not complete 
the performance and lost the 
fifth set 15–12.
Junior Heather Holton had 
14 kills in this match for the 
Tartans, and Mueller contrib-
uted another 13 kills as well. 
Donahue and sophomore Sar-
ah Jurgens each had 10 kills in 
the offensive performance for 
the Tartans, and Newton had 
43 assists. Higgins led the de-
fense with 28 digs, while Do-
nahue and Jurgens both had 
two solo blocks.
These losses will surely put 
a damper on the impressive 
run that the Tartans have put 
together in the beginning of 
this season, but they can learn 
from their mistakes in these 
games to get back into their 
normal playing form.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
wrapped up UAA round robin 
play with a match against 
Brandeis University. The 3–0 
win ended the Tartans’ week-
end on a high note and im-
proves their record to 16–4. 
The Tartans won each set deci-
sively, with set scores of 25–13, 
25–16, and 25–23.
Senior setter Emily Newton 
had a strong offensive perfor-
mance with 18 assists, while 
sophomore Lauren Mueller 
had 14 kills. Senior Jackie 
Gibbons also contribute five 
kill in the victory. Sophomore 
Amanda Thiele had eight as-
sists of her own and first-year 
Maia So-Holloway had six. 
Senior libero Molly Higgins 
recorded 18 digs in the win.
The Tartans return to UAA 
play on Saturday, October 
15 as they take on New York 
University in the second UAA 
round robin. The game will be 
played at Brandeis University 
and is scheduled to start at 
10:30 a.m. The Tartans will look 
to improve on their already 
winning record by learning 
from their mistakes.
Men’s soccer ties Brandeis in a close UAA competition
ALEX WOOD
Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s soccer team faced off 
against Brandeis University 
on Saturday in University Ath-
letic Association (UAA) con-
ference play. The Tartans tied 
the Judges 1–1, which takes 
the Tartans’ record to 7–1–1.
There was little action in 
the beginning of the game, 
but that changed in the 17th 
minute when the Tartans 
committed a foul and award-
ed the Judges a penalty kick. 
Sophomore goalkeeper Alec 
Lam saved the penalty kick at-
tempt, but the shot rebounded 
to a Brandeis player who im-
mediately took another shot. 
Lam didn’t give up and made 
a diving save, only to have the 
rebound be sent straight to 
the back of the net before he 
could react. 
The Tartans only managed 
to take one shot in the first half, 
which came in the 17th minute 
when sophomore midfielder 
Zack Masciopinto headed a 
shot toward the goal but it was 
too wide. 
The game remained stag-
nant for the rest of the first 
half, with neither team find-
ing a way to capitalize on 
the small opportunities they 
could find. Then in the 50th 
minute, a Brandeis player re-
ceived a red card and the Tar-
tans were given a one player 
advantage on the field. This 
advantage allowed the Tar-
tans to exert more pressure on 
their opponents, which culmi-
nated in the Tartans’ first and 
only goal of the game in the 
76th minute. 
Sophomore forward An-
thony Gulli shot a free kick 
that appeared to be saved by 
the Brandeis goalkeeper, but 
he couldn’t secure it and the 
ball rolled across the line to 
tie the game at 1–1 for the 
Tartan men.
The Tartans had finally 
gained some momentum, and 
Masciopinto took another shot 
a minute later but it sailed too 
high. Shortly after, Lam saved 
a shot by Brandeis that would 
have given them the lead. The 
game would end up going 
into the overtime period tied 
at 1–1.
The extra time was much 
of the same as the second 
half. Each team had a few 
chances to score but neither 
could capitalize. The Tartans 
and the Judges each had a 
shot on goal that was saved by 
the respective keepers. With-
out any team to definitively 
take the lead, the game ended 
in a 1–1 tie. This was the first 
of the season for the Tartans, 
who also only have one defeat 
on their record so far. 
The Tartans will play on 
their home turf on Tues-
day, Oct. 4 as they take on 
University of Pittsburgh-
Greensburg at 7 p.m.

Sarah Gutekunst | Publisheradvice for awkward people
on bagpipes, haggis, scotch and making Andrew Carnegie proud
Dear Sarah,
Carnegie Mellon is such a mixed bag. You never 
know what you’re going to get when you set 
foot on campus each day. Perhaps you’ll run into 
two people in a camel suit to celebrate hump 
day, or maybe a bike will nearly run you over, or 
someone will even offer you a free condom.
These distractions keep me on my toes or make 
me laugh. They are a small detail in my journey 
that reminds me that I’m at Carnegie Mellon, and 
I’m happy about that.
But one part of the Carnegie Mellon experience 
that I can’t get behind is the bagpipes. Last 
week some guy held the entire Cut hostage with 
Scotland the Brave and pop culture covers like 
the Game of Thrones theme. 
I could hear the horrific screech of the bagpipe 
all the way from my class at Baker Hall. How am 
I supposed to focus on the nuances of Proust’s 
seminal work when it sounds like a cow is having 
its tail hairs ripped out, one by one?
I’m all for tradition and the unity that having 
school pride will bring, but why does it have to 
be in the form of plaid skirts and terrible music? 
Why can’t we embrace single malt whisky and 
haggis with as much fervor? I think most students 
would agree, these are much easier to get 
excited about.
Begrudingly,
Bummed About Guy Playing Offensive Overtures 
Proudly
Dear BAGPOOP,
Carnegie Mellon is a place full of surprises. It can 
be a challenging environment, far beyond the 
reach of your influence. 
That said, I like your suggestion that we embrace 
Scotch and haggis. My advice to you is to blaze 
this new trail. Lead by example. If you walk 
around with scotch in your water bottle all day, I 
can pretty much guarantee that bagpipe music 
will stop making you want to shove pencils into 
your ear drums. In fact, it might even make you 
want to get up and dance.
I’m sure the ranks of Tartans around you will 
follow suit. We’re sure to embrace the fun that we 
can have by living life like Ron Swanson. Scotch 
is without debate the best thing to come from 
Scottish culture. By living it up, you’re basically 
doing Andrew Carnegie a favor. He would want 
you to celebrate Scotland in the most exciting 
possible way. It’s a gift to his legacy.
But don’t forget to drink water.
Happy drinking,
Sarah

India Price | Online Editorfall in love with Starbucks again
 The sweet, salty, and spicy on Starbuck’s 2016 fall drinks menu.
I’m waiting patiently in line at Starbucks on 
the corner of Forbes and Craig. The line wraps 
around the small island and out the door. 
Students are sitting shoulder to shoulder at tiny 
tables. I’m wedged in between chairs and a 
cooler of $4 water and over-priced salads. I try 
to turn and adjust my footing, but my backpack 
slams into an over-the-top display of imported 
coffee and a cardboard cutout of Oprah. 
My jeans rub against the hand-written 
chalkboard menu. I’m starting to get a little 
frustrated. I scan the menu and think the same 
thought I have thought many times before, “Am 
I really going to wait 30 minutes just to pay $6 
for an average tasting coffee so that they can 
inevitably spell my name wrong on the cup?” 
I’m sure you already know the answer. I waited.
I have to admit, I get a little excited for the fall 
drinks menu at Starbucks. I’m usually strong 
enough to walk away from your day-to-day 
hazelnut macchiato, but there’s something 
about those very pretentious-sounding seasonal 
drinks that rope me in every time. I come 
running time and time again, spending all the 
money I don’t have, to get my hands on the 
trendiest fall drinks.
The fall drinks offer up some different items 
than those on the summer menu. My personal 
favorite is the Salted Caramel Latte. This drink is 
arguably the best idea Starbucks has ever had, 
considering they charge more just to add salt to 
the previously-existing caramel latte. I won’t lie, 
it is good. Really good. But as I finish my drink 
I inevitably find myself thinking, “Why did I pay 
extra for a caramel latte with some salt in it? I 
could have just bought a caramel latte.” I feel 
defeated and full of remorse. But I’ll inevitably 
be back. I tell myself I won’t. But I will be.
Easily the most talked about seasonal fall drink 
is the infamous Pumpkin Spice Latte (PSL). I 
resisted this dangerous temptress for as long as 
I could. I’m proud to say that I had never tried 
a PSL of any kind, until the fall of last year. I’ve 
since then had several from various locations. 
Starbucks’ rendition is no lesser or greater than 
any other. 
So what factors of the iconic PSLs have made 
it a true symbol of fall? Is it the beverage’s 
perfect pairing alongside a grey Northface and 
Uggs for a trendy Instagram photo? Is it just 
the bougie feeling you get when you say you’re 
drinking a Starbucks PSL? One thing is for sure: 
No pumpkin-flavored item will ever truly fill the 
deep void in my heart left by the absence of 
pumpkin pie. 
But I’ll probably get one this fall, hate myself for 
it, tell people it’s a cappuccino when they ask, 
and drink my latte in shame.
Starbucks is adding a brand new fall drink to 
their seasonal menu, the Chile Mocha. I haven’t 
had the time to try this bad boy out for myself. 
But what I’ve learned as a Starbucks customer 
is that the Chile Mocha will be good but $2 too 
expensive.
I’d love to sit here firm in my resolve and tell 
you I won’t post Snapchat stories of myself 
drinking lattes this fall, or that I won’t buy the 
Gingerbread Latte the moment I get word 
that it’s arrived. It’d be great if I could tell you 
these things, but I can’t. I’ll most likely have 
had a latte by the time you’ve read this. And 
I’ll definitely post at least one tweet about how 
great the Peppermint Mocha is (but seriously 
though, it is really good).

---------------------------------------------------

The Australian children’s band drew throngs of excited 
children and their parents to the Wiggle Town tour’s 
stop at Byham Theater on Sept. 27. Children trailed by 
as their families trickled under the flashing marquee 
and through the glass doors. Some rode on their par-
ents’ shoulders and some excitedly skipped down Sixth 
St., thrilled to see their favorite band in person. Their 
parents, rather than the beleaguered faces I assumed 
would line the theater, seemed just as excited to see 
their kids watch the Wiggles as the kids were. The 
Byham Theater, which rose in place of a famed vaude-
ville theater, was set to be the new home of many fam-
ily memories.
There was an atmosphere of such anticipation as fami-
lies began to arrive. The temperature began to drop as 
the wind blew off the Allegheny River and many of the 
children coming through the door had been whisked 
from an afternoon nap. They needed the energy to 
match their excitement for the show. 
For many of the children, maybe even most of them, 
it was the first show they ever saw. Some hadn’t fully 
woken up when we went to ask them questions, but as 
they did, they became more eager to tell us their favor-
ite Wiggle or their favorite song. Their parents joyfully 
helped them along, trying to simplify our questions — 
I’m not very good at talking to children — and seemed 
to revel in the whole experience.
One woman stood near the door, waiting for her nieces-
to arrive. She had seen the Wiggles before; she took 
her daughter at one point. She described that show as 
“amazing,” and though her daughter decided she was 
too old for the Wiggles this time, the rest of the family 
certainly didn’t agree.
The continuous stream of Kodak moments never 
seemed to stop. A woman even walked in with a 
Dorothy the Dinosaur costume flanked by two miniature 
Wiggles on either side. Children’s activities are often 
meant to be silly, but it’s hard to remember how fun that 
is when you’ve cast it off as childlike and immature. I 
never made it inside the actual show, but just a glimpse 
of the people coming in was necessary to know what 
the night meant to them. As more people began to 
come down the street, it wasn’t hard to tell who would 
continue across the Roberto Clemente Bridge to watch 
the Pirates’ gasping playoff hopes finally die and who 
would slip into the theater. More than a few of the 
children were decked out in the Wiggles’ signature 
monochromatic turtlenecks and some had even donned 
face paint for the occasion. Emma Watkins, also known 
as Yellow Wiggle, was a particularly popular costume 
choice among the young fans. Maybe it’s a quirk of 
Pittsburgh’s sports team logos that nearly every girl mim-
icked Watkins’ yellow turtleneck and black skirt, but it 
showed the power of representation that she resonated 
so strongly.
The Wiggles’ appeal to young girls is a natural extension 
of their origin; after all, the story of the band begins 
with a young girl. The tragic origin the Wiggles can be 
traced to the death of founder Anthony Field’s young 
niece as Field was trying to gain a foothold in the music 
industry. The heartbreak gave him a profound sense of 
empathy for young children, something that would later 
become a thread through everything the Wiggles found-
er accomplished. Fields went on to study early childhood 
education before founding the Wiggles, who continue to 
donate to the Sudden Infant Death Syndrome research 
and prevention.
It was there, in the vaudeville house that saw its new 
life as a cinema and then again as a theater, that Field’s 
memories of his niece saw new life in the children’s music 
that Field creates and again in the moments the families 
in attendance will never forget.

Note: The Tartan recently sat down with Professor 
Dawn Weleski, one of the creators of Conflict Kitchen, 
to discuss the iconic eatery and her motivations behind 
it. The following writing is based on the same. Enjoy!
Conflict Kitchen is a takeout restaurant and perfor-
mance art piece located at the forefront of Schenley 
Park Plaza that serves cuisine from countries with which 
the United States government is in conflict. It is run 
by Jon Rubin and Dawn Weleski, two art professors 
at Carnegie Mellon University. The restaurant alters 
themes with respect to current geopolitical events and 
during each iteration there are various related events, 
performances, publications, and discussions related to 
that theme. Since its original conceptualization in 2010, 
Conflict Kitchen aims to increase the diversity of discus-
sion in public spaces and engender a sense of curiosity 
about the lives of people from other countries.
Both local Pittsburgh residents, Rubin and Weleski 
are artists who wish to make the Pittsburgh experi-
ence unique and engaging. It is their hope to help 
people admit their own lack of familiarity, prevent 
them from inheriting preconceived notions from 
their family, friends, and news media, challenge 
their own perceptions, and understand foreign life-
styles.
Conflict Kitchen launched about six and a half 
years ago. It is the only restaurant in the city that 
has represented the cuisines of Iran, Afghanistan, 
Venezuela, North Korea, Palestine, and the 
Haudenosaunee Confederacy. Prior to that, Rubin 
and Weleski ran another restaurant called Waffle 
Shop: A Reality Show, operated by Professor Rubin’s 
students. Weleski noted that they discovered “food 
was an amazing way through which one could 
engage with many different kinds of people from a 
diverse set of backgrounds and get them together 
to talk about potentially sensitive topics.” In an 
effort to establish a restaurant that complemented 
the experience of Waffle Shop, while occupying the 
unique niche of cuisine from regions that the U.S. is 
in conflict with, they established Conflict Kitchen.
Each iteration takes about two years for Weleski and 
her team to prepare and conduct research for. They 
travel to other countries, interview people, cook 
and shop with families, and work with chefs from 
that country and the diaspora in the U.S. After that, 
they select a diverse range of viewpoints from inter-
views that they conducted. They print this selection 
of quotes on posters, or ‘wrappers,’ that they hand 
out free of charge at the restaurant, which ultimately 
act as storytelling devices for the Pittsburgh public.

Chris Sheng | Junior Staffwriter

---------------------------------------------------

Weleski added that Conflict Kitchen is one of the very few art projects 
she has experienced that is almost entirely self-sustaining, with 97 
percent of its revenue collected from food sales. She explains that 
Conflict Kitchen serves anywhere between 250 to 400 people daily, 
drawing visitors from all over the world. With such a large fan base, 
there are others around the world developing their own versions of 
Conflict Kitchen.
Within the short history of Conflict Kitchen, Weleski and her partners 
have pivoted operationally several times over the past few years based 
on public response, the staff’s satisfaction, and their interests as artists. 
She said that as a socially engaged project, they need to be able to 
balance between many expectations: “It’s about being able to build 
a level of flexibility to the art project so that we can be responsive to 
our interests as artists, as well as to those of the public.” From staff 
unionizing to a death threat against the restaurant and its staff during 
their Palestinian iteration in November 2015, they’ve encountered and 
managed many challenges along the way.
Conflict Kitchen has had a tremendous impact on the Pittsburgh com-
munity. Weleski mentions that, according to a survey conducted a year 
ago, most people were engaging with the information distributed by 
the kitchen: they took the information home, shared it with others and 
conducted their own research.
As for the new Haudenosaunee iteration, Weleski and her team spent 
two years researching in preparation for it. They were able to learn the 
food and culture of the Haudenosaunee people while really gaining 
an understanding of the culture’s opinions of various conflicts they’ve 
encountered, including the cultural erasure that has occurred. In fact, 
last year they celebrated Indigenous Peoples’ Day. Weleski explained 
that “First Nations people are so often fetishized and exoticized, 
further exacerbating the level of prejudice and misinformation about 
their many diverse cultures and ways of life.” This iteration at Conflict 
Kitchen aims to create and spread awareness of the many indigenous 
people that still live throughout the mainland United States with thriv-
ing culture and communities. Weleski shares that there are actually 
over 560 federally recognized nations and tribes of indigenous people 
in the U.S. Their goal is to end the cultural disregard that has prevailed 
by introducing the six nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy, a 
group located near the Pittsburgh area. She mentions that in the near 
future they also plan to potentially extend to other indigenous nations.
As for the cuisine, Weleski highly recommends the Iroquois White 
Corn Soup. It’s a soup that needs to be cooked for 24 hours, and 
is made with a specific corn that is only grown by a farm in Victor, 
New York. The choice of this vegetable is no coincidence: by using 
this type, Weleski pointed out that they are “not only talking about 
the culinary history of the Haudenosaunee, but also highlighting a 
local indigenous product and an example of cultural preservation 
and indigenous technology.” Conflict Kitchen also has plans to bring 
a Seneca woman from the Iroquois White Corn Project to cook the 
White Corn Soup.
With the emphasis on starting conversation with and about other 
cultures, Conflict Kitchen continues to bring together people of dif-
ferent backgrounds to learn over something that connects us all: a 
good meal. Make sure to try out the unique foods and views of the 
Haudenosaunee culture and all future iterations of the restaurant.

Tired of college? Sick of campus 
food? Want to be in a somewhat 
more relaxing place? Go to Craig 
Street!
Right across from the Carnegie 
Museum of Art, Craig Street is a nice 
place to freshen up a bit, and get 
just a little away from the Carnegie 
Mellon bubble. With restaurants 
and stores from all sorts of places, 
from Asian to Irish, Craig Street is 
definitely the place to go when you 
crave a sense of home or just want 
to explore a different culture.
EatUnique is one of the restaurants 
on Craig Street. Featured are sand-
wiches “hot off the grill” and the 
fresh salads. Every day, EatUnique 
also has a daily special menu, and, 
trust me, every single item on the 
specials is absolutely delicious. If 
you’re a vegetarian, EatUnique is a 
nice place to get a hot, freshly made 
sandwich for when you’re tired of 
the cold and stale salads you get on 
campus. 
The incredible food aside, 
EatUnique also scores on conve-
nience for Carnegie Mellon students 
by allowing us to use DineX for pur-
chases, thereby providing a wise and 
guilt-free way to burn away one’s 
extra DineX at the end of semester. 
Besides the regular food, EatUnique 
also provides affordable and tasty 
catering services.
Not far away from EatUnique, and 
right next to Little Asia, is a cute 
little store called Irish Design Center. 
While unremarkable on the outside, 
Irish Design Center is incredible 
once you step inside. It contains a 
large variety of Irish goods, from 
knitwear to decorations to candy 
bars. According to the owner, the 
store has been on Craig Street 
for over 40 years now. As one of 
the oldest Irish stores around the 
place, Irish Design Center probably 
has anything Irish you could pos-
sibly ever need. What’s even more 
special is that the large majority of 
the products are directly imported 
from Ireland and Scotland, with the 
remaining minority made at an Irish 
factory in the United States. 
The store is a nice place to check 
out if you’re in the mood for any 
Irish-style clothes (especially knit-
wear), jewelry and decorations, or 
maybe just want to experience the 
culture, or even just take back a box 
or two of the finest Irish tea. Irish 
Design Center also offers a collec-
tion of Irish gifts, which are all pretty 
and affordable. There’s going to be 
a special discount for St. Patrick’s 
Day and a side walk sale during 
summer time, so be sure to drop 
by then!
Snowlion Import, also along the 
street, has arguably the most 
exotic facade of any place on 
Craig Street. Like Irish Design 
Center, Snowlion Import is also a 
store that sells imported goods. 
That said, Snowlion Import sells 
items from Nepal, Tibet and 
India. Having been around for 
over 14 years, Snowlion Import 
is the first Tibetan store in the 
Oakland area, and the store with 
the largest collection of Tibetan 
goods in Pittsburgh.
The store sells all sorts of items, 
from artifacts, jewelry and deco-
rations to clothes, religious and 
ritual items for Buddhist practi-
tioners. You can find everything 
here: earnings made from mete-
orite, gift cards with mysterious 
patterns, sports-wear made of 
the most comfortable fabric you 
ever touched, pillows and books 
for practicing Buddhism, and 
small spiritual items that wish 
you good luck. The owner of the 
store, a Nepalese native, sched-
ules several trips between the 
U.S. and Nepal just to select the 
best products to bring back from 
Nepal. A portion of the benefits 
of the store also go to underprivi-
leged children in Nepal. Even if 
you’re not too keen to buy any-
thing, Snowlion Import is a great 
place to just walk through, to 
feel the calm incense, talk to the 
owner and learn more about the 
history of Nepal and Buddhism. 
Most of the items at Snowlion 
Import are relatively affordable 
and you can always ask for a dis-
count. Don’t hesitate if you ever 
do decide you want something, 
because as the owner says, “get 
them now, since they won’t stay 
long.”
Top Notch Art Supply, more casu-
ally known as the art store on 
Craig Street, is a great place to 
visit if you’re an art or architec-
ture student. The art store has 
everything you’d need as an art 
student, and if you ever want 
something the store doesn’t 
stock, you can ask the owner and 
he will be more than happy to 
order it for you. Compared to 
the campus store, the art store 
on Craig Street is better stocked 
and, most importantly, much more 
affordable. With a flat 40 percent 
discount in the back to school 
season, and a regular 20-50 
percent discount for VIP custom-
ers, the store is a great place to 
restock on art supplies, or even 
just drop in for a chat with the 
always friendly and fun staff.
Besides the above stores, Craig 
Street has so many more places 
to check out. The comic store 
with a large collection of books 
and toys, Lulu’s Noodles with 
tasty bubble tea, the froyo place 
that is open till midnight, there 
are so many more to try and 
experience. 
Get off campus and take a short 
10-minute walk with your friend 
to experience everything in Craig 
Street. It will be worth it.

“Queens! Queens!” was the call-and-response 
cry heard many times from the Helen Wayne Rauh 
Theater in Purnell last Thursday night. Drama Queens!, 
organized by Wendy Arons, professor of dramatic 
literature, and Kristina Straub, professor in the 
Department of English, through the Center for Arts 
and Society here at Carnegie Mellon, was a gathering 
of six world-renowned performance artists. Beautifully 
emceed by Sara Lyons, a directing masters student, the 
show was a series of 20-minute segments in which each 
artist performed whatever they wanted to — from a 
future funeral, to a Boston sports bar, to a 17th century 
nun.
Erin Markey, a performance artist, comedian, writer, and 
composer based out of New York, was the irst of the 
Drama Queens to perform. Markey entered the stage 
in daisy dukes, tweety bird leggings, and a shirt covered 
in drawings of designer purses. She told the audience 
that she had always wanted to sing a very speciic song 
in front of a huge crowd with a full orchestra behind 
her and passed around a clipboard with a ‘legally 
binding’ document for all of us to sign that would 
require all of us to plan her funeral. We had a dress 
rehearsal of her future funeral, including such highlights 
as a volunteered ‘friend of the dead’ overcoming 
Markey’s rigor mortis to prop her up and puppet her 
jaw to mouth along with a practice orchestra and her 
pre-recorded vocals. Once we had inished practicing, 
Markey sang her beloved song, a truly moving club jam 
that told the story of a baby named Secret who was 
very tragically born without labia. Markey’s dry, absurdist 
humor was the perfect way to start an evening of 
challenging conventions.
Holly Hughes, the second act, is a writer and performer 
who currently teaches at the University of Michigan. 
Hughes is know for her plentiful portfolio of work, as 
well as being one of the NEA Four, a group of four 
performance artists who were denied funding by 
the National Endowment for the Arts in the 90’s for 
‘obscenity’ of subject matter.
Hughes spent her twenty minutes talking about her 
time with the Women’s One World (WOW) Café, a 
feminist theatre space in New York City that was a 
central part of the mid 80’s avant garde theater and 
performance art scene in the East Village. Hughes 
talked about her experience as an — as she says — 
‘accidental’ founding member of WOW. Hughes spun 
a colorful and articulate story of her part in the culture 
of queer, feminist art. Punctuated with photographs 
and lyers from the original years of WOW, Hughes’ 
talk gave an intimately personal look into the history 
of counter-cultural performance art and celebrated 
the success of a pivotal group in the queer, feminist 
movement.
The third queen to perform, Desiree Burch, is a 
London-based writer, actress, artist, and comedian. For 
this event, Burch performed a section of her full-length 
solo show Tar Baby, a ‘carnival of capitalism and race 
— where no one’s a winner but everyone’s still playing!’ 
This segment of Tar Baby focused on two anecdotes 
adapted from Burch’s life.
The irst of these was an audition for an NYU student 
ilm where the audition table hipsters asked her to 
perform a single line with just about every euphemism 
they could think of until she realized they wanted her 
to perform it ‘more black’. Burch then performed 
that line — a simple “Hold the elevator!” — in an 
uncomfortably hilarious stereotype of every one-
dimensional black character to ever grace a ilm screen.
The second anecdote was about Burch’s experience 
growing up as the only black girl in her suburban 
California town and the anger and frustration that 
led her to create a racist caricature of herself. Burch’s 
explanation of the fact that her greatest moments 
of power and popularity came when performing 
this minstrel show version of herself, and how much 
she hated herself for not being able to let it go 
was touching and thought-provoking in a way that 
bordered on prompting guilt. Burch’s performance 
was incredibly challenging, especially for an audience 
unfamiliar to such explicit talks about race, but was very 
well handled. Deb Margolin, a playwright, actor, and 
founding member for Split Britches Theatre Company 
came fourth in the evening’s structure. Margolin is 
currently an Associate Professor at Yale University, and 
has authored ten full-length solo performances, one of 
which she began to perform for us at that night.
After giving her watch to an audience member 
and telling them to stop her when her time was up, 
Margolin performed the beginning of her play 8 Stops. 
The play, as Margolin puts it, is a comedy about the 
ways in which we answer each other’s narratives, and 
‘the grief of endless compassion’. She talks about a 
young boy she met on a bus, her son’s obsession with 
the possibility of an endless death, and her battle with 
Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. In twenty minutes, Margolin 
made her audience laugh, groan, and verge on 
crying. Her erratic energy gave a possibly dark subject 
the layer of levity and humor it needed to keep the 
audience engaged over an hour into the show, and her 
understanding of her story lent her the gravity needed 
to tackle a heavy subject without seeming frivolous.
Becca Blackwell is a trans actor, performer, and writer 
living in New York City, and was the ifth performer 
that night. Like much of Blackwell’s work, their solo 
show They, Themself and Schmerm exploded our 
societal ideas of personhood and our relationships 
to our physical bodies. Blackwell’s stand-up styled 
performance began with a few stories about their 
experience growing up, and then shifted to a longer 
story about one of their more absurd experiences as 
an adult at the ‘least likely to hurt us looking’ sports bar 
in Boston. Blackwell joked about their irst foray into 
differences between men and women’s bathrooms 
and the etiquette (or lack thereof) required in each. 
Blackwell’s performance was a riotous, high-energy 
smashing of the gender binary. A solid presence 
on stage, Blackwell brought a physicality to their 
performance that recreated mess, bizarre, and strange 
situations in a hilarious way.
The sixth and inal performer, Carmelita Tropicana, 
has been performing in New York’s arts scene since 
the 1980s. When she walked on stage the irst thing to 
come out of her mouth was a rapid-ire back-and-forth 
between English and Spanish telling us about her plan 
to ‘channel the spirit’ of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, a 
poetess nun from 17th century Mexico. Dressed in the 
ever-so-traditional garb of 17th century nuns (black and 
white latex) Carmelita Tropicana read two of Sor Juana 
Inés de la Cruz’s poems — “Inés, cuando te riñen por 
bellaca” (“Inez, When Someone Tells You You’re A 
Bitch”) and “Con el dolor de la mortal herida” (“Love 
Opens a Mortal Wound”). Carmelita Tropicana’s high-
energy poetry readings were the perfect way to end 
the night. She was a captivating presence on stage, 
and held the audience’s attention even when she was 
speaking in a language not everyone understood.
Drama Queens! was a truly once in a lifetime event 
that we were lucky to have on campus. All six of these 
artists had never performed together, and likely won’t 
ever again, and though each of them had only twenty 
minutes, they all said something thought-provoking 
and unique in a true experience of a show.
