Third Straight Big Four 
To Be Claimed By 
West Virginians
The annual track reunion of West 
Virginia, W. & J., Pitt, and Carnegie 
was held at Morgantown Saturday 
under the name of the "Big Four 
Meet." And as was the case last 
year, West Virginia emerged victori­
ous, Pitt second, the Tartans third”, 
and the Presidents fourth.
A fast track aided in the establish­
ment of four new track records, 
two of which were made by Russell 
Callaway, West Virginia University 
sophomore, who broke both the 120- 
yard high and the 220-yard low 
hurdle records that existed for both 
the University and the “Big Four.” 
He spanned the course of the highs 
in 15 seconds flat and captured the 
lows in 25 seconds.
100-Yard Dash Mark Falls 
Pete Bowen, the Panther captain, 
set the third -new meet mark by 
ruiming the 100-yard dash in 9-1/5 
seconds. Harris and Uttcrback, both 
of Pitt, placed second and third re­
spectively in the event.
Uttcrback, Pitt’s Negro star, bet­
tered his own mark for the “Big 
Four" with a spring of 23 feet 9H 
inches. •*
; The Mountaineers amassed a total 
..of lOlJ/j .points while Pitt garnered 
76, Carnegie 30, and W. '& J. 16'/i. 
The West Virginians captured nine 
firsts out of fifteen, Pitt claimed 
four, and the Plaids one.
Wilson Wins High Jump 
The Tartan laurel gatherers included 
Dreshar, who took second in the 
hammer throw; McFarlin, who placed 
third in the 120-yard high hurdles; 
Ncase, who claimed a fourth in the 
440-yard dash; Scyboth, who put the 
shot for a fourth; Ackcnheil,1 who 
came in fifth in the 220-yard low 
hurdles; Don Shafer, second man in 
the two-mile event; Murray, who 
tossed the javelin into third place; 
Barger and Merten, who pole vaulted 
for second and third heights re­
spectively; and Wilson and Morten, 
who high jumped for first and sec­
ond places in the event.
Four New Records Made 
Twenty-eight Tartan representatives 
left by bus Friday evening for 
• Morgantown where coach Guy Iial- 
fcrty joined them Saturday morning. 
The meet was called at 10:30 Sat­
urday and lasted until late in the 
afternoon. Medals were awarded the 
first five places in all events.
The “Big Four” is gradually com­
manding more and more attention 
because of its significance in rating 
the standings of the contestants. 
Last year’s meet ended with seven 
new records accounted for, and this 
ijcar’s get-together added four more, 
which means that the future record, 
breakers will necessarily have to be 
genuine stars. No doubt many of 
trie present marks will stand un­
molested for several years to come. 
The meets thus far have also re­
vealed that the University of West 
Virginia is a consistent producer of 
(juality track teams; that Pitt ranks 
$econd, and that Carnegie and W. 
& J. are below the Panthers by 
many points. However, the show­
ing made by the Plaids Saturday 
indicates a rising standard in Tar­
tan track teams.
Season Closes Friday 
With the Grove City meet Friday, 
Carnegie will close its track season 
for the current year. A victory over 
the Grovers will give the Tartans an 
edge in their five dua) meets this 
season. The Plcbc trackmen closed 
their competitive season last Friday, 
hut will continue to work out until 
the varsity campaign h over.

The ticket sale for the A. F. E. 
E. annual banquet on May 21, will 
be held in the Electrical Office, 
12:30 to 1:30. The tickets, to be 
sold at $1.75 each, may be obtained 
by any electrical student wishing 
to attend. As there will only be 
80 plates, those wishing tickets 
should secure them at once. A 
special effort will be made to in­
duce the Freshmen who have signed 
for the electrical course, to attend. 
It is an opportunity for them to 
become acquainted with their asso­
ciates for the next three years, and 
to learn the functions of the organ­
ization.
The A. I. E. E. banquet is this 
year being held at the Penn-Lin- 
coln Hotel. Among the guests will 
be included all members of the 
electrical faculty. It has been an­

Gifts totalling $425,000 to extend 
over a five-year period for the 
establishment and maintenance of a 
coal research laboratory at the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
were announced yesterday by Dr. 
Thomas S. Baker, president of the 
institution.
The Buhl Foundation of Pitts­
burgh is the largest single donor 
to the project, contributing $50,000 
at the outset for the equipment of 
.the laboratory, and $25,000 a year 
for five years for a program of 
pure research. The. gift of the 
Buhl Foundation is made with the 
stipulation that certain additional 
amounts shall be securcd from 
other sources. This condition has 
now been met through the co­
operation of six great American 
concerns who arc the other con­
tributors to the project that has 
been outlined by Dr. Baker. The 
firms co-operating are the United 
States Steel Corporation, the Gen­
eral Electric Company, the Kop- 
pcrs Company, the New York Edi­
son Company, the Standard Oil 
Company of .New Jersey, and the 
Westinghousc Electric and Manu­
facturing Company. These six cor­
porations will contribute a total of 
$50,000 a year for five years for 
the maintenance of the laboratory.
Effective July 1
The laboratory will be located on 
the north side of Engineering Hall 
of the Carnegie Institute of Tccli-j 
nology in a new wing constructed 
last summer.
The plan for the new laboratory 
will go into effect July 1, 1930. 
Several prominent scientists arc be­
ing considered as members of the 
staff, and it is expected that ;i di­
rector for the laborator3r will be 
announced soon.
The laboratory, according to. Dr. 
Baker, will be a part of the Car-, 
negie Institute of Technology, and 
will undertake fundamental re­
search in coal and the products 
which may be obtained froiir • it. 
The Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology will organize graduate 
courses for the training of students 
in fuel technology in connection 
with the research laboratory, with 
the research staff giving instruction.
An advisory . board, consisting of 
prominent men of affairs interested 
in coal research, will be appointed 
by President Baker, to advise him

A revision of the Constitution was 
discussed at the recent meeting <3f 
the Inter-Fraternity '"Council. It was 
decided unnecessary to revise the en­
tire constitution to meet the demands 
of the new type council now in, 
force. It was deemed necessary to 
revise, Article 3, which in revised 
form states that each fraternity shall 
be represented by its president and 
a junior member, one of whom shall 
vote on all questions. The junior 
member is to be chosen by the presi­
dent. The. first semester president 
shall be council representative for 
the entire 3rear, and be eligible to 
receive the Council Representative 
Key. The sixteen fraternities repre­
sented unanimously voted the .ac­
ceptance of these revisions.
Dean llirig discussed the effects 
of “Hell. Week”- on the freshmen 
with the council. He regards “Hell 
Week” jio a hindrance to the'fresh­
man’s progress because it comes at; 
a critical time in the freshman year," 
and generally results in the abscence 
of the initiate for the entire week, 
or. part of week. Mr. llirig definitely 
stated that he wished “Hell Weeks” 
abolished entirely or curtailed as to 
time and hazards to which the initi­
ate is exposed.
Under new business nominations 
for next year’s officers were accepted. 
The following were nominated: Presi­
dent, Selsam, Smedberg, and Bryant; 
seoretarj', Eisen; treasurer, Gilliland. 
The nominations were left open, nev? 
ones to be sent to the secretary. The 
election for above positions will take

Seventeen Colleges Send 
Representatives to 
Ann Harbor
The women from the University 
of Michigan, Ann Harbor, enter­
tained 300 delegates from 17 col­
leges at the sixth National Athletic

Women, on April 24 to 26. Among 
the 17 colleges were registered 
Wellesley, Ohio State, . Cornell, 
Purdue, Mt. Holyoke, University 
of Washington, University of Pitts­

The A. C. A. C. W. organization, 
which emphasizes mass participa­
tion and discourages intercollegiate 
competition, holds sectional con­
ferences for its members, every year 
in different parts of the United 
States, and a national conference 
every three years. The direct per­

Delta Mu fraternity was installed 
as T au Chapter of Kappa Delta 
Rho, national social fraternity, 011 
Friday evening, May 16. The in­
stallation was conducted by the 
national officers assist efl by the 
Penn State Chapter. At- this time, 
the present active members of Delta 
Mu became affiliated with Kappa 
Delta Rho.
Saturday evening, May 17, the 
fraternity gave a formal dinner and 
dance at the P. A. A. Professor 
G. R. Kirkpatrick was toastmaster 
of the occasion. Theodore Karr, 
a graduate of Carnegie Tech, spoke 
in behalf of the alumni' of Delta 
Mu, while Merle Smedberg, the 
president of the. active chapter, 
spoke for the present chapter. 
Dancing followed the dinner, with 
music furnished by the Black Kat 
Orchestra. Decorations were car­
ried out in the fraternity colors, 
bjue and orange.
At the last regular meeting of 
Physics Colloquium Thomas ' Lip­
pert and Malcolm Morrison, seniors 
in the department, delivered talks 
dealing with the subject matter of 
their theses.
Mr. Lippert discussed the "Ther­
mal Conductivity . of Chromium.” 
In his talk he outlined the methods 
of preparing the chromium and of 
conducting Lhc test. His results 
were about one-tenth of the cal­
culated value; the discrepancy being 
explained by the fact that the 
chromium was not pure. As far 
as is known, Mr. Lippert is the 
first person .to find the thermal 
conductivity of chromium by ex­
perimentation.
Mr. Morrison’s subject was 
“Losses in Vacuum Tubes.” He 
explained his apparatus and the 
methods of conducting the experi­
ments. In discussing his results 
lie gave the losses in the various

TIIK FOUR NEW, TRACK RECORDS established at the 
“ 11 i;; l-'our” meet in Morgantown, Saturday, added to the seven 
high marks set last year will undoubtedly mean trouble to the 
lraclc aspirants who aim to set even higher’goals in the future. 
J »(s time of 0-4/5 seconds for the 300-yard dash will prob­
ably withstand the assults of many a star sprinter before falling. 
Ulterbark's leap of 23 feet inch.ej will likewise appear as a 
great gap to hop for several meets to come. And Callaway’s 
times i<ir the two hui-dling events arc near the top. But, as in 
everything else, there is always, a chance for improvement, so 
the safest prediction'to make is that the new records will stand 
at least until next year's “Big Four,”* * >H * i(!

the Marylanders G-‘J. All the doubles matches in both meets 
were captured by the Plaid team, which speaks well for team- 
work. And Loxtcrman came to the front by winning both of 
his singles engagements. But Georgetown turned the tide of 
affairs by sending our raccjueteers away scoreless. Even at
that, two meets out oi three isn’t so very bad.

TRACK TOO WILL GIVE WAY TO EXAMINATIONS. 
Coarh “Guy" Halfcrty’s cinder path men will make their final 
Appearance against Grove City in a dual meet at the Bowl, 
Friday afternoon. Thus far, the Tartans have broken even in 
dual meets, the score standing at 2-2. A victory over the 
Grovers would make an ideal finale for the track season—and 
it’s not impossible—nor improbable.* * * *
AS THE CLOSE OF TI-IE TRACK SEASON AP- 
!j?KOACHES, two Plaid luminaries continue to shine. Don 
Shafer, senior P. & D., has proved his ability as a long distance 
cinder path artist as well as-an oil paint artist. Don insisted 
ill at the -I 1.0 was his calling until Coach Halfcrty persuaded him 
to work out on the cross-country course last fall. And so well 
did lie work over the six-mile course througn Schenley Park 
tfliat, when all was said and done, lie was high point man for the 
season. In the Pitt meet last Tuesday, Shafer trailed along in 
fifth /.position for the first four laps around the stadium track, 
shifted up to third place in the sixth lap, and spurted past 
C’aeser. the Panther star, as the eighth and final lap began and 
iiiii in d without any apparent efTort well ahead of his rivals.
I-laving already gathered enough points to assure him of a 
track letter, Don will be the first athlete to collect three varsity 
in ignias in one year since M larpster turned the trick in his 
¡¦juplionnire year. , During the tank season, his cross-country 
."(bilily gave way to his swimming hobby, and when the fiwim- 
ljiing schedule was completed, he emerged from the pool with a

Varsity Trackers Lose To Pitt In Dual Meet 87-48
The powerful Pitt Freshman 
track team handed the Plebes their 
first setback of the season last 
Tuesday at the Stadium by a 62-55 
•score. The teams were on even 
terms throughout the meet and it 
was not until the returns from the 
last event were that the winner 
was decided.
Miller, a former Kiski star, was 
the Icadiifg point scorer of the 
meet, capturing firsts in the one 
hundred, two-twenty, and quarter 
mile events. -His victory in the 
quarter-mile provided' the thrill of 
the afternoon. Taking the lead 
early in the race he was not head­
ed, hut in the final stretch Cap­
tain Coulter of the Plcbc outfit 
forced him to the limit and it was 
only by a superb sprint that Mil 
ler gained the vcrdict by less than 
a yard. Coulter and Sigmund once 
more were the big point men for 
the Plebes. Coulter, in addition to 
his second in the quarter) won both 
the hurdle events with ease, while 
Sigmund captured three seconds in 
the one. hundred,- two-twenty, and 
the broad jump.
The Plebes were the only team 
to sweep' an event, capturing all 
three places in the pole-vault. Laiv 
plicr’s vault of 11 feet 6 inches to 
capture this event was one of the 
afternoon’s outstanding perform­
ances.’ Cooper’s high jump mark 
of six feel: and the performances 
of Luch in the shot and discus 
events were on a par with most 
varsity competition as was Ram 
scy’s performance in the mile.
Although the Plebes had enter­
tained high ho.pes of conquering 
the' Panther yearlings they arc well 
satisfied with the meet, for it is 
the closest a Plebe track outfit has 
come to taking the measure of the 
Blue and Gold in a number of 
years.
/Kiskiminitas Springs School for 
,Boys, better, known in this region 
as Kiski, sent their strong track 
and field team to Pittsburgh' last 
Friday where they gained a 71-46 
verdict in their dual meet with the 
Slcibo yearlings.
Jimmy Simms, former Mononga- 
hcla High School boy, was the big 
star of the meet. He won the low 
hurdles, the high jump, and the 
broad jump,' and finished second to 
Tom Coulter in the low hurdles. 
His point total of 18 easily gave 
him scoring honors for the day. In 
the field events, Matheny, also of 
Kiski, was the outstanding per­
former with firsts in the shot and 
the discus. ' .
The. best mile of the year at the 
howl was turned in by Wadic of 
Jsislti, who finished with a strong 
sprint after he had trailed Ramsey 
the Plcbc star for the first four 
laps. The time—4:39 3-10—is ex­
ceptional for a Prep school lad and 
would do justice topmost varsity 
competition in this section. The 
sprints were featured by the fine 
work of Putnam, Kiski star, and 
Sigmund, Plaid luminary. These 
two staged a dead heat in the 100 
which is something one seldom 
sees in a dual meet. Putnam also 
put on a great race in the quarter, 
outsmarting Coulter on the turns 
to gain a yard advantage at the 
finish, lie furnished the crowd
Skibo Sports To 
End With Geneva 
Tennis Encounter
As was prcdictccl, Pitt easily de­
feated the varsity track team last 
Tuesday at the Stadium. However, 
when the records were totaled, Car­
negie had 48 points to Pitt’s 87 
which was expccially gratifying con­
sidering the fact that the Tartans 
were competing with such stars as 
Bowen and Uttcrback.
The most interesting race of the 
day in the eyes of the loyal Carnegie 
rooters was the two-mile run. Don 
Shafer, like a Greek 1 of old, won
with case, running a very. well- 
balanccd race throughout. For the 
first three laps the field of runners 
was well bunched, but at the crack of 
the gun for the last lap, Don forged 
ahead and at the finish a wide margin 
separated him from Caesar and
Smoycr, Price ran a very fine race,
but tired too much in the Jajt lap.
"Pete” .Bowen, Harris and Vitltna, 
all of Pitt, ran almost a dead heat 
in the 100-yd,-dash with no Carnegie 
runners placing in the event. It was 
practically the same in the 220, with 
the exception of George Ncasc, who 
brought in a third for the Skibos. 
Things looked bad for Carnegie when 
they did not place in either the 440 
or 880, but in the mile run Brown
took a.third.
The hurdle races were both taken 
by Knobloch, but both McFarlin and 
Ackenheil pressed him close. Ackcn- 
heil has shown wonderful improve­
ment under the tutelage of Coach 
Guy Halfcrty.
While the tract events were being 
taken by Pitt men, Carnegie was 
not idle in the field events, where 
most of the Skibo’s points were 
gathered. A clean sweep in the 
javelin gave the Tartans nine points. 
Uttcrback took two firsts, one in the 
broad jump and the other in the 
high jump, but Seyboth, Toussant and 
Barger of Carnegie took the first in 
the discus, shot put, hammer and 
pole vault. Captain Merten was a 
close second to Barger in the pole 
vault.

This week will mark the close of 
Tartan athletic activities. Only the 
varsity track team and the varsity 
and- Plcbc tennis teams arc func­
tioning at the present time, and 
they will ring down ' the curtain 
on their formal activities within 
the next four days.
Coach Guy Halferty's cinder path 
men will stage their final show-off 
in a dual meet against Grove City 
at the Bowl Friday afternoon.
The Plebe trackmen closed their 
competitive season last Friday with 
the Kiski meet, but will probably 
continue to keep in shape until the 
varsity men close their card. With 
such promising Freshmen as Coul­
ter, Blaine, Ramsey, Croissant and 
Sigmund and several others, next 
year's varsity representatives will 
be well bolstered and no doubt ac­
count for themselves in a stronger 
manucr than this year.
Coach Hoover's racquet wiclders 
returned from their eastern trip on 
Sunday, bringing with them two 
victories out of three engagements. 
During tlie week, four matches are 
carded: a return match with Pitt 
set for yesterday afternoon on the 
Tartan courts, a postponed match 
with W. & J. at Washington today, 
a home meet with Bethany Bisons 
Wednesday, and the finale to be 
played with Geneva at Beaver Falls 
on Saturday. The match that was 
to have been played here with 
George Washington on Friday -has been cancelled.
Three contests this week will 
also wind things up for the Plebes. 
I he Pitt meet yesterday, Kiski 
Wednesday, and the concluding 
match with Union High school of 
Turtle Creek Saturday will com­
plete the Plebe tennis schedule.
plenty of thrills in the 220 but 
weakened in the last stages of the 
race and was forced to take a sec­
ond to Sigmund.
This meet closed the season for 
the freshmen. Their record of four 
victories against two defeats is 
very commendable and a number 
of I lie Plebes are already regarded 
mainstays for next season's 
varsity.
Netmen Win Two Out Of Three On Eastern Invasion
In returning from the matches 
with the cream of the racquet moguls 
of Washington, D. C, and vicinity, 
Coach Hoover's team presents two 
hard-earned and worthy victories. 
Both Johns Hopkins and Maryland 
Universities suffered defeats at the 
hands of our well-balanced nct- 
men. Hopkins v-is 'jwned with a 
4 to 3 count, while he Marylanders 
succeeded in only one of the seven 
matches. While the latter was by 
far the most decisive victory, it re­
quired more and a better brand of 
tennis than the former. All the 
doubles matches were captured by 
the Plaid team against these two 
colleges, and Loxtcrman came to the 
fore by winning both of his singles. 
In their encounter with the George­
town net team, our racquettccrs were 
turned away scoreless.
Today our team is visiting W. & 
J. with good hope of bringing home 
favorable results. Bethany College 
will put in an appearance here on 
Wednesday, and Saturday 'will close 
the season with a match with Geneva 
College at Beaver Falls.

The oven... 
the cook... 
and the cake
‘‘Only fine ovens produce cakes of fine tex­
ture.” This rule applies as surely to the most 
complicated “cake-baking” process in modern 
industry . . . making > steel castings for high 
pressures... as it docs to the simplest domestic 
cookery. In basic-lincd Heroult electric fur­
naces that apply the heat directly and cleanly 
to the metal and permit exact control of tem­
peratures at every stage, the steel for Crane 
cast steel valves and fittings is prepared. Every 
casting is annealed under temperatures held at 
i6oo° F. for hours, then slowly shaded off 
to cooling. Interesting as is the Vulcan-like 
foundry equipment in Crane foundries, com­
plete as are the manufacturing resources that 
give exactness and uniformity in production, 
the vital secret back of quality in Crane electric 
steel materials is not the “oven” but the skill of 
the “cooks” .. . the chemists, the superintend­
ents, the workmen who watch and control 
each step and process. Through 75 years, this 
skill has been developed and refined. Back of 
it is an exhaustive scientific library of labora­
tory studies and test charts. Much of the data 
that has enabled Crane Co. to produce depend­
able valves for the enormous, pressures and 
temperatures riovv used in industry is collected 
in a book, “Pioneering in Sciencc.” It is a valu­
able reference book for students Let us send

Yes, I really have an idea. I don’t 
know whether it is worth anything 
or not, but it won’t hurt stating it, 
and if it meets with your approval, 
¦why, well it will be worth something, 
and if it does not, well, it is just 
one more of those brilliant thoughts 
gone by ' the way-side. Here is. my 
idea:We hear a lot of talk, and sec a 
great number of people, boys, girls, 
young men, young women, students, 
day and night, and grown ups too, 
about a certain fad which has taken 
the country by. storm. You can even 
buy the equipment in the five and ten 
cent-stores. What I refer to is that 
all absorbing sport of YO YO. Did 
3'ou ever see anything take the coun­
try so b3r storm. Every place you 
go you see them trying to play the 
game. 1 say trying, because therein 
lies my'idea. Why not start a course 
at night to teach all these people the 
correct technique of this all fascinat- 
. ing game. It is pathetic to see some 
of the attempts made by those 
novices in the game, .when this could 
all be remedied by establishing a 
course at Night School. Til bet'that 
we would have a record turnout for 
registration.
Well 1 suppose we will have to 
wait another twelve months for some 
amelioration of that all absorbing 
feature of paper towels. 1 had hoped 
that I could be able to say that 1 
was not the last one to use the last 
towdl, but better times surely will be 
corning, and 1 am still hoping that 
>ve will have theni before long.
Have you noticed the floral decora­
tions growing around the shelter pa­
vilion which has been erected at the 
Cut? They surely do make the place 
look attractive. Before long we will 
1 have the proverbial ivy clinging to 
the masonry of the structure, and 
then it will be a wonderful sight to 
see—“I cling to thee."
It was funny, my missing DIDJA 
NOTICE, and the Book Review, and 
they to be in the last issue, of the 
Plaid. Now 1 expect to read them 
this issue, and am looking forward to 
a great deal oi real "good reading, 
¡because the book review does have 
a lot of good brain matter inter­
spersed between tlxc words. In re~; 
gard to. the DIDJA NOTICE, I . bet­
ter start a saying HAVEYA NO­
TICED, and then start out with a 
few remarks about thus and so, just 
by way of change. I wonder if E. 
5. would object to this?
Well I ndticff spring is here, at 
least F. C. intimated that in last 
week’s issue of Plaid, and 1 am sure 
he or she knows. It has sorta got­
ten into my blood lately, even chough 
the season for straw hats hal arrived, 
by date 1 mean, not by weather, be­
cause such an unreliable thing as 
weather cannot be depended upon, 
still you better not blossom out in 
the new head gear until you are sure 
the weather has settled,- because you 
arc liable to get the said bonnet wet, 
and you know what that means.
Notice To Ticket Salesmen
All night students who have been 
selling tickets for the Night Student 
Council Dances are. requested to make 
an immediate return to the treasurer 
of all tickets sold by them.
The Inter-Night. College Dance 
was the last affair on the night stu­
dent’s social calendar and your co­
operation in hastening the return of 
tickets sold will be greatly appreciat­
ed .by the Council.
INTER-NIGHT
COLLEGE
The final curtain of the social 
season of the Night Student Coun­
cil for the 1929-30 season has been 
dropped. For those night students 
who participated in these social 
functions this termination leaves a 
feeling oL regret.
The last affair of the season was 
the . Inter-Night College Dance. 
This came at the close of the 
successful Spring Carnival of the 
Student Council.
The Committee in charge of the 
Inter-Night College Dance is cer­
tainly to be commended for the 
splendid manner in which the func­
tion was carried out. Surprises 
were in order all through the 
evening.
The music furnished by Bocchic- 
cliio and liis Venetian Serenaders 
was the best that has been heard 
at any of the night functions. It 
would be heard to find an aggrega­
tion which, would excel this group 
of musicians. They had volume, 
tone; tempo, and all that goes to 
make a successful dance.
A surprise in the shape of u 
special dance was featured during 
the intermission, and afforded a 
pleasant diversion. The dancers 
showed that considerable time and 
effort had been expended in re­
hearsing their number, and pleased 
th.c audience so much that an en­
core dance was made necessary.
Another feature of the dance was 
the decoration scheme. It was 
very effective and novel. The us­
ual balloons were there in abun­
dance, and certainly added to the 
effectiveness in transfixing the au­
ditorium of the Men’s Gymnasium. 
This was only apparent when -they 
were finally taken down. A very 
effective scheme was devised to 
distribute the balloons, . and the 
distribution was effected in a sur­
prisingly short space of time. 
Every one had a bunch of bal­
loons, and their explosions- fur­
nished no end of merriment.
Refreshments were on hand as 
usual and in. a plenteous amount, 
and judging from the crowds 
which , were around this , section, 
these refreshments just hit the 
^pot.
We >had as our guests Mr. and 
Mrs. Walker, Mr. and Mrs. Grcss 
and Mr. and Mrs. Mylrea. It was, 
indeed, a pleasure to welcome these 
members, of. the.-Faculty- ¦ to- our 
party.
Like all: good things they come 
to an. .end, and it is regretted that 
the sbcial ' season has been termi­
nated.
Value Of The
Supplementary Term
Although we "Owls” arc ready for 
a few evenings to ourselves about 
this time of the year, there arc many1 
of us who, for various reasons find 
a supplementary term a necessity, 
or an easy way to lighten the next 
year’s schedule.
It is true enough that the register­
ing for the term has its disadvantages 
which includes interment in such 
glorious (?) weather, opening of 
several sport seasons, and above all 
things—that which effects even night 
students thoughts “in spring time.'
But the advantages are such that 
they should be seriously weighed. In 
the first place, j'our efforts are con­
centrated solely upon one subject 
which allows more study of thd par­
ticulars and obviating the necessity 
of keeping a mass of data from 
other courses in one’s head at the 
same time. This advantageous feat­
ure is recognized by many who arc 
desirous of learning well a subject 
that is considered more impoitimt 
that others> in a set course. VVhi'e 
more material is covered, the work 
must be done in a shorter space of 
time and ' this concentration mikes 
for better results.
Other advantages which appear to 
me at this time arc brevity, the lack 
of distractions, the low fees, and the 
possibility of scheduling other sub­
jects next year!

Dinner Dance Of Nu 
Sigma Alpha Fraternity 
To Be Held May 24
Final- arrangements for a very 
successful dinner dance, to be held 
by Nu Sigma Alpha Fraternity 
have been made. This .dinner dance 
will be held at the Penn-Shady 
Hotel, in East Liberty. A very 
successful affair J is looked forward 
to by the members and pledges. 
If jrou have, not sent in j'our res­
ervation, you better do so at once.
\ No doubt there arc a large number 
of night students who arc commenc­
ing to wonder where there marks 
have gone, whether they hav<’. been 
sent out, or what, has beoomc ot 
them.
Did you ever stop to think what a 
stupenduous task it is to compile 
grades for some 4,000 night students. 
W'c arc prone to think our marks 
arc the only important ones, and that 
the other 3,999 don’t count. If you 
have ever thought a little about the 
subject, you will readily realize that 
it would lake you a long time to 
get this, data prepared in such a 
shape to have it ready to mail ou!. 
to those who arc waiting at the 
other, end..The clerical force in the Registrar’s 
Office cannot be augmented jusr for 
the compilation of grades. The 
cbmpilirig of this data requires a well 
organized and experienced personnel 
to assemble all the grades for the 
almost countless number of course? 
offered' at night, and it is no wonder 
that it takes a long time to have it 
ready for distribution.
If therefore, you have not received 
your grades, do not become •in­
patient. They will be mailed out to 
each and every night student just as 
soon as they have been assembled.
REVISION TO BE MADE

Information Discloses Variety 
of Personalities Visit the 
Campus By Moonlight
An inquisitive reporter with noth­
ing else to «do stationed himself on 
the “Cut” where the. walk separates 
in a Y and asked one hundred night 
students, picked at random, the ques­
tions printed below. These questions, 
asked for the purpose of getting a 
cross-sectional view of the student 
body in matters of intelligence and 
personal tastes answered their pur­
pose very well as can be shown by 
the answers listed also.
The questions follow:
1. Do you believe whistling with 
marbles in the mouth cure stuttering? 
97 answered “Yes;” 2 “No;" 1 "Who cares.”
2. Do’ you use coffee in your 
morning cup of sugar? 100 answers 
were “Ha-Ha-Pla-'Ha-Ha, that sounds funny.”-
3. What do you expect to do ‘when 
you graduate from Carnegie? 30 
answered “Haven’t thought'of it; 27 
“Work for a living;” 38 "I’ll never 
graduate;” 4 "I’m taking Industrial 
Education and will be here for 28 
years yet;” 1 "Get a Good Job sell­
ing papers.”
4. Do you believe in reincarna­
tion? 97 “What’s that?” 2 “Huh;” 
1 "1 didn’t quite get your question 
but I prefer roses’.”
5. Do you read the "Plaid?” 35 
“Yes;” 34 “Sure;” 31 “Uh huh.”
6. Where would you be tonight if 
you did not have school? 3 “Home,;” 
28 "At the Academy;” 69 "Some­
where else.”
7. What do you think of the moon ? 
45 "It certainly is pretty tonight;” 
55 “That stuff they hand you up in 
Braddock is terrible.”
8. What is you opinioli of the math 
courses as taught here at Carnegie? 
49* "Could be better;’’ 49. “Could be 
worse;’’ 2 “Not enough short di­
vision.”
9. If you were caught in l forr^st 
fire with no means of escape, what 
would you do? 43 “Look for fire 
plug;” 56 "Sing the Prisoner's Song;” 
1 "Wasn’t you a boy once, why ask 
me?” .
10. If you were crossing a field and 
an infuriated bull started after you, 
what would you do? "Wave a red 
flag in front of her;”. 14 “Stick a 
club between his legs and trip him;” 
1 "Be nonchalant, reach for the Bull 
Durham.”
And here my dear roadcr you see 
the various personalities arid the qual­
ity of the gray matter of those who 
come to Carnegie to be taught, or 
maybe . to teach, for the inquisitor 
had no way of telling how many in­
structors lie had questioned.
' Now .that vacation time is here 
and the annual trip is staring you 
in the face, don’t overlook the fact 
that, the best place to go to see 
.everything there is to sec in Amer­
ica is that little state out West 
called California. No, we’re not 
boosting the place for Will Rodg­
ers or Art Brisbane, but among 
otlic'r things of interest that arc 
in California, don’t overlook ’the 
exceptional climatic conditions.
Of course, there arc orange 
groves and almond groves and 
lcmond groves and pecan groves 
and picnic groves and droves of 
groves. Then there is Hollywood 
with its “slie” men and “it” girls, 
and Los Angeles has Aimcc Mac- 
Phcrson. But the climate! Ah, 
the climate; that belongs to the 
state.
A few facts- on the climate and 
unusual weather conditions of Cali­
fornia arc given.
. The hottest temperature, ever re­
corded in the world was in Death 
Valley, July 10, '1913, when/ the 
mercury climbed to 134 in the 
shade. Bodic, in Mono county, 
holds, the California record for the 
other extreme, with 36 degrees be­
low zero.
While many parts of the state 
have never seen snow, Alpine 
county had a fall of seventy-three 
foct in the winter of 1906-07.
Del Norte county -cgistcrod 
153.54 inches,of rainfall in a single 
year. Lake county had 71.54 inches 
fall in a single month. In San 
Bernardino county is once .rained 
16.61 inches is a single day. In 
the -same county there is a section 
where not a drop of rain has fallen 
for several years.
Since 1871 snow has (fallen but 
'fourteen, times in San Francisco. It 
is never deep, for the longest 
snowfall is but for. a few minutes.
With the conclusion of my 
course at Cacnegic, mcthinks I will 
head for San Francisco, where the 
average temperature for the hottest 
month of .the year and that of the 
coldest month varies only 9.5 de­
grees. With such an even clifriatc 
arid being able to pick fresh fruits 
and vegetables all the year round, 
Mm I Mini Mm! What could be 
sweeter? I ask you.-G.

DYNAMITE clears the way for modern engineering wonders
Now that the Inter-Night Col­
lege Dance is a thing of the past, 
the Night Student Council Social 
Functions have been brought to a 
successful end. Approximately 1,250 
couples enjoyed themselves at the 
four dancds sponsored by the 
Council.
Because of the large crowds that 
turned out for these dances and 
the inadequate space in the union 
to accommodate them, it bccamc 
necessary to find a larger floor on 
whichi to hold our affairs. The 
gymnasium auditorium was the an­
swer to the question and the so­
cial committee, headed by Mr. 
Hoddcr and Mr. McDonald, set 
about to make the dances the suc­
cessful affairs they have turned out 
to be.
All this success was not accom 
plished, however, without hard 
work. Several difficulties present­
ed themselves at the most inoppor­
tune moments and had to be reme­
died. A suitable orchestra arrange1 
mcnt had to be worked out where­
by the music could be heard equal 
ly well over the entire floor. Thu 
matter of decorations was no small 
item of worry to those who finally 
solved the problem. The gymna­
sium is far from befing a ballroom 
and to try to give it the appear­
ance of one was a titantic job.
However, all stories have a hap­
py ending and Council together 
with the Social Committee deserve 
a vote of thanks from the entire 
student body for the very success­
ful manner in which they worked 
together to put these dances across. 
They have set a standard that we 
hope will never be lowered and 
with the loyal support of the stu­
dent body it will even be. raised 
higher.

INDUSTRIAL ARTS
GROUP DINNER 
SCHEDULED MAY 22
The Industrial Arts group of the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
will hold its annual dinner on May 
22 on the Campus at the Faculty 
Dining Room of the Carnegie Inn.
This group is unique, as it com­
prises both the night students and 
the day students in otic course. 
Ail the subject matter is distrib­
uted throughout the course, and 
any student who becomes irregular 
during the day ( may pursue the 
course at night.
This dinner is the annual get to­
gether of the group and affords a 
chance to all the students who arc 
registered to sec cach other at 
least once a year.
A very interesting program is 
scheduled, and there will be guests 
from the University of Pittsburgh, 
the Pittsburgh Board of Education, 
and our own Faculty on the Cam­
pus. The 'dinner is scheduled at 
6:30 p. m.
Night Students Still 
Returning Locker Keys
During the past week several keys 
were received by the Night Student 
Council from night students who 
wished to donate the fee to the 
Endowment Fund. This shows a 
spirit of generosity, towards the 
! school, and is .very much appreciated 
I by the committee who has been work­
ing on the Locker Key Donation to­
wards the Endowment Fund.
When the complete list is available 
it will be published, and credit given 
those students who gave. Of course, 
there were a great number of stu­
dents who would like to give, but 
their circumstances were such that 
it was not possible. We appreciate 
this situation, and arc only too glad 
to acknowledge the spirit of willing­
ness shown even though it was not 
possible to give.

more hydro-electric power 
for the South
How dynamite was used 
in the , construction of 
this great project
T
he Carolina Power and Light 
Company needed more electric 
power to serve the territory in which 
it operates. The result was the Waterville Development . . . avast 
hydro-electric project located in the 
Great Smoky Mountains.
The actual working of this projcct 
involved the erection of a constant 
arch dam, 183 feeL high . . . three 
tunnels varying in length from 5,000 
to 16,000 feel . . . three penstock 
tunnels 600 feet in length ... a verti­
cal shaft known as a gap shaft . . . 
and a'Surge tank shaft.
From the Watcrville Development, 
transmission lines carry the current 
to many points in Carolina and 
Tennessee. The tremendous power 
of the Great Smokies serves to turn
the wheels of industry and light the 
homes of thousands of people of the 
South.
Such a development would not 
have been possible without the use of 
dynamite. Du Pont explosives were 
used for all blasting operations.
The engineer of tomorrow needs to 
know all there ia to know about dynamite . . . the tool that; helps 
to build skyscrapers, bridges, dams, subways, tunnels, roads and railroads.
How can you know more . . . now 
. . . while you’re »till in college? 
Write the du Pont Company for a 
copy of the "Blasters’ Handbook.” 
This booklet contains a wealth of 
information about explosives . . . in-' 
formation gathered in twenty-eight 
years’ expcriencc in making and im­
proving explosives. It is compact 
. . . handy. It ia use<J in the class­
rooms of leading technical institu­
tions. Your free copy is waiting for 
you. Write for it.

The New Staff
With this issue of the “Tartan,” the new-staff takes control 
arid will hold reign until this time next year. We have no 
sharply defined editorial policy and no particular perjudices 
against any individual or group of individuals, but will merely 
strive to do what we think best for the Campus, and for Campus 
affairs.'
In the short space of one year a general overhauling of 
•Campus affairs cannot take place, ,an,d will not be attempted, 
but there .are several things to which we have always been 
opposed and which we will attempt, thro Ugh ¦ editorials, to 
correct.
We will endeavor to continue where our predecessors left 
off in the upbuilding of a better arid more progressive “Tartan,” 
and if we accomplish this alone we will feel justified for .our 
time and.trouble.
Spring Carnival
The inauguration of the 'Spring Carriival at Carnegie this 
year was, perhaps, the best thing that has happened to the 
/school in several years. It. was not. a revival of thé old time 
Campus Week as many suspected it \Votlld be, but rallier, the 
beginning of something new and something decidedly essential 
to the school and to the student bqdy.
Not for several years has such a spirit of friendship and 
amiability been apparent among the students as was in evidence 
c,luring that particular week-end. Jvveryohc greeted everyone 
else and introductions were unnecessary, Which was as it should 
be, not only then, but always.
The Carnival was not a huge succc^ due to the failure of 
the Show, but it managed to pay for itself, which was some­
thing. Its success as a social event, however,, cannot be denied 
;ind its continuance in the future should not be questioned either 
by Student Council or by the Administration.
The new chairman, of Student Council's social committee, 
whoever he may be, should not hesitate to include the Spring 
Carnival on next year’s social .calendar, and the Administration, 
if they desire to increase friendliness and chummincss. among 
their students should not raise any objection whatsoever. Car­
negie has taken a step forward. Those in authority should in­
sist that its direction is not changed.

Once upon a time, Willie Shake­
speare, Nancy Newman, or one of 
the other great literary contempo­
raries of the world, said, in very 
solemn tones, 'All good things 
must end.” Now neither Mr, 
Shakespeare nor Miss Newman had 
any idea that their playful wise­
crack would ever apply to the en­
tertaining career of a Carnegie 
columnist, but it has. For, with 
this issue, the present campus pest, 
or, as Floy Sample with her usual 
quaint mannerism puts it, "campus 
devil," better known as "From the 
Fence” to ardent Tartan devotees, 
passes into the heretofore unex­
plored hereafter, and must leave 
this benevolent campus behind him. 
(Orchestra strikes up "Hearts and 
Flowers,” omitting jazz rhythm.)
As is the custom, when one must 
leave scenes which after many 
years of labor and sorrow have be­
come very dear to him, one must 
jot down a few of those things 
which have happened to him, or 
have been called to his attention, 
which are known better in circles 
as "Memoirs.” So it is our pleas­
ure to reveal, for the first time in 
any of the country’s great newspa­
pers—any which care to print 
¡them: "Carnegie Memoirs of Mr. 
F. T. Fence.”
True to the world of columnists 
to the last, we’ll write the forth­
coming jargon in true colutnnistic 
style, that is, so many words, then 
so many asterisks, followed by .so 
many more words. We’ll start back 
in the fall of 1926 and continue 
right up until the delightful little 
boat ride handed over to tlje 
school at large by Marion'McNary

1933. Here ^oes!

and continual proximity of flicker­

dance floor .amply erased the .delusion 
and recreated the illusion, for

c^tra rations.
Quaint Amulets Displayed
The pirates proudly displayed a 
multitude of curiously wrought em­
blems on their chests, called ‘fra­
ternity pins’ by conventional society.
These quaint amulets were, it 
seemed, the ^original source of their 
presence, and without them entrance 
to the vessel would have been im­
possible.
The group was strangely homogen­
eous in spite of their apparent uni- scc ¡(. wj]j a«ways 
formity of costume, for we heard 
some conversing with the utmost 
profundity oji metaphysical subjects, 
while others “boop-boop-ah-dooped" 
the entire evening away, to the 
tooted strains .of current jazz. Pirates 
have ,a sentimental cranny in their 
nature, else. why the congestion on 
the decks? A passing steamer focuscd_ 
its stcainHght on the length of the 
boat—probably finding enough ma­
terial for social reformers to write 
about the collcgiatc generation for 
months!
All the pirates were there, from 
“Old Father Time,” with his mousey 
beard lo the youngest castaway child, 
with all the intermediate stages of 
glorified piratcsscs and degenerate j 
rogues in between. This w"" ¦
annual frolic, their return to ll,c j covering almost every discussion customs of their anccstcrs, their 
escape, from the monotonous conven­

»modern world. Carp was left, behind 
—in the innermost pockets of. [tlicir 
civilian clothes, ,and they frisked and 
frolicked 1 i 11 dawn, when, as the news 
item so blandly states: 'The ‘Steam­
ship Julia Belie’ steamed into har­
bor late the ; me night, somewhat 
the worse for wear.” v
say that science can cure all the 
ills of this phase of our business 
life, but research offer's the best ^ 
opportunity for solving many of its 
baffling problems. We are in the 
center of-the greatest coil''field and 
the greatest coal market in the 
world. It is important that the 
people of this district should have 
near at hand the best scientific0 re­
sources that can be secured in the 
world to .aid them in dealing with 
what is most vital to the welfare 
an'’ progress of our community.
"Coal touches almost every’ phase 
of modern life. As far as we can 
be the chief 
source of power, and cheap power 
is an • essential to human welfare in 
our present civilization. It is the 
source of many of the necessities 
of life.‘‘There is no laboratory at pres­
ent in the United States that is. 
doing the work that we have'out­
lined. There arc many uses and 
by-products of coal still to be de­
veloped. Finally, there is the ques- 
<tion c?f the smokeless city' which 
can never be answered until a 
serviceable smokeless/fuel 'has been 
discovered."
THISTLEDOWN
His Autobiography (Concluded 
from Last Week)
Who can foretell what . misfor­
tunes may befall a student during 
a summer vacation? Getting en­
gaged, for example. Discnwolle 
had been promised a splendid salary 
by the Amalgatcd Petting Com­
pany, .incorporated for . the purpose 
of extracting moonshine—the most 
suggestive dance hall illumination 
from cucumbcrs, and for making 
out of the refuse of this process, 
as a by-product, a very good qual­
ity of synthetic cheese. Two weeks 
after Discnwolle entered thc.labora- 
torics of the company: it went bank­
rupt. Then for a couple of weeks 
he held a part time job reading 
Russian newspapers to a refugee 
who had been made both deaf and 
dumb by the Italian fascists. The 
five days before it was raided lie 
was a dumb waiter at the Merry- 
milk Night Club. From all these 
activities he earned hardly enough 
to buy text books the next fall.
In the autumn he returned to 
Tech,, broke. . No time did he have 
for columning. But ’by peddling 
peanut butter from house to house,- 
lie earned enough money to pay 
his tuition. A job as secretary to 
an elderly Monongahela navigator, 
who was writing a book, “The Mys­
teries and Miseries of Oakland,” 
brought him enough money to pay 
his fraternity bills. An assignment 
to the-Pittsburgh. territory as sole 
representative for a new kind of funicular pretzels solved his other 
financial worries. It had been a 
summer of work without much pay; 
it was a winter of work without 
much play.
One evening last spring, when 
Thistledown was sitting on the fra­
ternity house porch berating a 
freshman fqr. his lack of. interest 
in activities, the plebe turned on 
him with,. “Oh, all right, I’ll go 
out for the Tartan next year. I’ll 
ask the editor to. lc.tunevwrite that 
column I’ve heard so muclv about. 
I expect, to get a B in English 
from Fisher,, so I guess. I’m not so 
bad.” Did ¦ Thistledown like the 
suggestion? Of course not! So this 
fall he began the column again, 
with what success his readers know 
better than lie docs. The rotten 
eggs thrown at him have been as 
welcome as the roses; lie has been 
more amused by the eggs, and lie 
found, that some of the roses con-
ccalcd thorns. Next week will bt 
farewell; then graduation; then a 
job. He is considering two: Pro­
duction manager in a cod liver oil 
plant (if lie takes this job he will 
be glad to send any of his readers 
a free sample—adv), and materials 
supervisor of a new company which 
intends shortly to manufacture and. 
place on the market liqueur flavor­
ed lipsticks (patent pending on the 
idea).
At last it should be dear from 
all this that Thistledown ought 
never to have been guessed to be 
,somc of' the persons who have 
been accused of writing this col­
umn. Every suspicion directed at 
Mr. Orbin was preposterous, and 
Thistledown, if he had been Fritz, , 
would have needed no disguise. To 
all those who have felt that per­
haps Thistledown came from Dean 
Tarbcll’s desk, Thistledown points 
out respectfully that surely Dean 
Tarbell Avould never descend to 
such poor attempts at levity as 
Thistledown has all the time em­
ployed. (The same reason should 
have kept suspicion from lighting 
on Professor Lawler, even though 
lie is official adviser to the' Pup­
pet.) Granting that the prettiest 
girl in Arts (she asks me to con­
ceal her name because she dis­
likes being stared al) might have 
written the column, Thistledown 
feels that she has employed her 
time much better this year in other 
ways. Of all the guests that were 
made, that of a little "Margaret 
Morrison sophomore was the best, 
who said to Thistledown one morn­
ing, “I read your column every 
week, Dizzvdown, and I know 
you’re it, because I've heard you 
say the same .things Thistledown 
docs.”. For. the still curious and 
unknowing, however, if there arc 
any, onc:' hint: In this paragraph
j arc hidden, not too carefully, his 
iiiitiafs and fraternity; let them be 
found, by any who like to work 
out, puzzles.
A ¿ohimcnt. Thistledown’s Auto­
biography is an astounding piece 
of prevarication. Who will believe 
it? Certainly no one who has 
known the author' himself. By the 
way, Why did no one ever' suggest 
that Thistledown was probably, the 
work of a night school student.

Technical Committee
A technical Committee, including 
representatives of the companies, 
that have contributed towards the 
support of the project, has bc^n 
appointed by Dr. Baker to. assist 
him in selecting the staff and ar­
ranging the research program. This 
committee is. composed of Dr. John 
Johnston, U. S. Steel Corporation, 
New York City; F.; P. Wilson, Jr., 
General Electric Company; Schcricc- 
tady, N. Y-; Dr.. F. : W. Sperr, Köp­
pers Company, Pitÿslnïrgh;. M. S.. 
Sloan, New York Edison Company,

Kintncr, Wcstinghousc Electric and 
Manufacturing Company, Pittsburgh, 
and Howard N. Eavenson, Eaven- 
son, Alford and-Hicks, Pittsburgh.
Myron C. Taylor, chairman of
dent Baker’s direction have prepared 
the way for this program and give 
assurance that it will have the 
cordial and sympathetic interest of 
outstanding men of science thrpugh- 
.out the world. The .probability 
that the laboratory may make im­
portant contributions to basic sci­
entific knowledge is ’strengthened 
by this relationship.
“The institute’s research program 
is, moreover, of distinct -economic 
importance to the Pittsburgh dis­
trict. The development in Pitts-- 
burgh of knowledge of coal, linked 
with additional provisions for train­
ing here expert technicians, may 
confidently be expected to have 
important consequences not only for 
this basic industry and for . those 
employed in it, .but for the people
generally.“The Foundation’s grant "for this 
research program in the natural 
sciences complements previous 
grants by the, board of managers 
for fundamental research programs 
in the social sciences in Pittsburgh. 
They are alike inspired by a desirethe Finance’Committee ctf the U. S:
Steel Corporation, has co-operated to advance the frontiers of knowl 
with Dr. Baker, in outlining the edge and to strengthen the factualplans for the rc%earch laboratory 
that will be unique in- America. It 
was largely through the endeavors 
of Mr. Taylor that the financial aid 
of the industrial concerns was se­
cured.
Director Gratified
Charles F. Lcwist director of the 
Buhl Foundation, in commenting on 
the laboratory that the organization 
which he heads has made possible, 
said:
“It is gratifying to the Buhl 
Foundation that to its grant have 
been joined'' sufficient additional 
funds to assure establishment at the 
Carnegie Institute of .¿-Technology, 
of -ui fu6d^rn -laboratory -for pro­
secution of a vigorous program of 
pure research in coal.'"Two inter­

our .eyes, for the last time, We say

Dr. Baker has long been inter­
ested in the study of coal and the 
use of its products. He was the 
organizer of the First and Second 
International Conferences, on Bitu­
minous Coal that attracted famous 
scientists from abroad, and drew 
the attention of the world to Pitts­
burgh. A third conference will be 
held in Pittsburgh at the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology in Novem­
ber, 1931.
Dr. Baker in speaking of the 
research laboratory for which lie 
has worked for several years, said: 
Pittsburgh Will Benefit 
‘ Pittsburgh is . the appropriate 
place in which to study coal. Its 
industrial greatness is based large­
ly on the rich supply of fuel in 
this district. Its future is some­
what endangered by the\ unsatis­
factory condition of the coal in­
dustry. It would be too much to
group.Nellie Lee Holt Speaker
At this year's conference, held 
at" the University of Michigan, 
where there are enviable facilities 
available for wonu'n interested in 
athletics, Miss Nellie Lee Holt, di­
rector of Religious Education, 
Stephens’ College, Columbia, Mo., 
gave the opening addr.css on the 
main theme of the conference, 
After College What?” Miss Holt 
emphasized the importance of worn 
an’s position in the World today. 
“Never before has woman ever 
had the chance to prove her capa 
biiitie.s as she has in this genera­
tion. And it is toward the college 
woman, especially of America, that 
the world is looking.” College ath­
letic associations can aid Women 
in the position she. will have to 
fill by encouraging those sports 
that- will be of use to- her • after 
leaving school. The more .a sport 
has to’ offer a woman throughout 
her life, the more valuable . that 
sport is,! for it will provide her 
with a healthy and enjoyable recre­
ation.
Favor Intra-Mural Sport
The main subjects, “The Rela­
tion of the Physical Education De­
partment to the 'Women’s Athletic 
Boards,” and .“Intercollegiate Par­
ticipation,” were subordinated to 
the many interesting problems of 
individual colleges. Of these two 
major topics, only the latter inti- 
matçly'concerns Carnegie.
Considering the ideal of the A 
Ç. A. C. Wv “to emphasize mass 
participation through intramural 
programs, Sports’ Days, a form of 
intercollegiate relationship which 
places emphasis upon play for all, 
and a varied program to. meet the 
interest of all women.” it is very 
surprising that no definite step has 
been taken to prohibit it among its 
own members, although it has been 
vigorously debated upOn at each 
confcrcncc. It seems rather incon­
sistent that an organization is try­
ing to wipe out something against 
which it cannot take a definite and 
official stand.
Play Day Emphasized
Nevertheless, aside from this 
evasi.vc attitude toward actual con­
demnation, the organization is en­
couraging the “play-day” among 
college women and even among 
those in the. high schools. The 
"play-day” lias found a great deal 
of favor here at Carnegie and also 
at the University of Pittsburgh.
Perhaps in a few ye^rs. when we 
have ' better facilities we may be 
able lo do for the -Pittsburgh high 
schools what the Univ.crsity of 
Pittsburgh dpe's 50 splendidly for 
neighboring colleges in its annual 
“play-djiy.”'Another very important plank 
11 the A. C. A. C. W. platform is 
the one concerning the “promotion 
of a health concept by all college 
women, with the hope of actual im­
provement in habits of living/.’ By 
the elimination of such .crutches as 
point system.^ and the substitution 
of- play-days for . intcr-collcgiatc 
competition, the A. C. A. C. W. 
hopes to bring all women out into 
the open in active, clean sport for 
the love of the game.
The spirit that these A. C. A. C. 
W. .conferences impart to every 
delegate alone justifies the sending 
of representatives each year. With 
the formal report of the Carnegie 
representatives to look forward to 
the. Carnegie Board Confcrcncc to 
be held at Dorscyvillc next month 
promises to be of greater value 
than that of.last year.
