Staffwriter
As part of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Information Net-
working Institute (INI) 
celebration of Carnival week-
end, Valerie Plame was invited 
to give a keynote speech on the 
issues of nuclear proliferation 
and cybersecurity, two ma-
jor threats that affect all of us 
today.
When you meet her, Plame 
may look like a regular activ-
ist for causes that all of us 
can relate to. But many may 
also remember her as the 
subject of the infamous 2003 
Plame affair, which ended her 
twenty-year career as a covert 
CIA agent.
In her keynote, Plame gave 
a brief overview of the events 
leading to her career at the 
CIA and the subsequent Plame 
affair. She described herself as 
“very honored” to have had the 
opportunity to serve her coun-
try by working for the CIA, 
continuing her family’s legacy 
of public service. Her expertise 
was in the issue of nuclear pro-
liferation and the covert cyber-
operations relating to it. She 
described the multifaceted 
training that she had to under-
go, which included surviving 
in the wilderness, jumping out 
of planes, shooting automatic 
weapons, and recruiting 
foreign intelligence sources.
In the years after 9/11, 
the U.S. government was pre-
paring to invade Iraq with 
the justi?cation that Saddam 
Hussein had nuclear weap-
ons. Her husband, a diplomat 
named Joe Wilson, went to 
Niger to investigate uranium 
transactions there and to ?g-
ure out if any of them involved 
the Hussein regime. Wilson 
concluded that America’s jus-
ti?cation for the war was false 
because he could ?nd no evi-
dence that Saddam Hussein 
was trying to buy nuclear 
weapons or nuclear material. 
After the war started, Wilson 
wrote a column discussing his 
?ndings. Shortly after, Plame’s 
identity as a covert CIA agent 
was leaked to the Washington 
Post, which she believed was 
done by administration of?-
cials as political retaliation for 
her husband’s article. She was 
forced to resign from the CIA. 
Plame described the situation 
at that time as a “complete loss 
of privacy.”
“You don’t know what it’s 
like until you have photogra-
phers on your lawn snapping 
pictures of your toddlers,” she 
remarked, re?ecting her con-
cern at that time about the 
safety of her family and the 
intelligence networks she had 
cultivated for two decades. 
She believed that the media 
?restorm and personal attacks 
on her that resulted re?ected 
the increasing unpopularity of 
the war among citizens. The 
leak became known as the 
Plame affair.
After summarizing her 
story, she moved on to the top-
ic of nuclear proliferation. She 
?rst started by calling election 
night “just ugly,” and said that 
the current president is very 
unstable and says many con-
?icting things. She remarked 
that none of the attributes she 
just described of President 
Trump “should be in the same 
sentence as nuclear weapons.” 
She believes the problem isn’t 
that President Trump has ac-
cess to the nuclear codes — it’s 
that they even exist in the ?rst 
place.
Plame gave a brief history 
of nuclear weapons, starting 
with the Cold War. During 
that time, there was a policy of 
mutual annihilation if either 
the Americans or the Russians 
were to use nuclear weapons, 
which worked as a deterrent. 
However, by 1982, American 
citizens got tired of this per-
petual brink-of-war state and 
approximately a million of 
them took to Central Park to 
CMU team places second in 14th CME Group Trading Challenge
ROSE PAGANO
Personnel Manager
CME Group, Inc., a ?nancial 
market company, recently re-
leased the names of the win-
ning groups of the 14th annual 
CME Group Trading Challenge. 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
team placed second, right af-
ter Rutgers University, who 
ended the three year drought 
of not having an American uni-
versity team place ?rst in the 
competition.
The participation in the con-
test this year had almost 600 
teams composed of over 2,300 
students coming from 35 coun-
tries across the globe. This was 
the greatest number of partici-
pants the competition has ever 
had. The contest is a four-week 
electronic trading competition 
available to teams made up of 
undergraduate and graduate 
students. The goal is to provide 
a chance to gain experience 
with techniques for trading fu-
tures among major asset classes 
on CQG’s professional trading 
platform. It is also the intention 
of the program to educate up 
and coming ?nanciers.
“We are pleased that a 
record number of univer-
sity students from around the 
world have chosen to partici-
pate in our annual Trading 
Challenge,” CME Group’s Man-
aging Director of Corporate 
Marketing and Communica-
tions Anita Liskey said in a 
press release. “CME Group is 
committed to educating the 
next generation of ?nance 
professionals about the signi?-
cance of derivatives markets in 
today’s interconnected global 
economy.”
Many of these groups’ 
advisors view this event as a 
way for students to re?ne their 
?nancing skills and attain 
more exposure to that ?eld.
“I am excited that our 
team’s participation and com-
mitment resulted in a ?rst 
place win in this year’s com-
petition,” said Ronnee Ades, 
adviser to the winning team 
from Rutgers University and 
Director of the Master of 
Quantitative Finance pro-
gram Of?ce of Career Man-
agement for Rutgers Business 
School. “The CME Group 
Trading Challenge is a great 
opportunity for students to 
gain hands-on experience 
with ?nancial markets, and 
complements what they learn 
in our academic program.”
The teams that emerge 
victorious from the competi-
tion received a cash prize and 
attended a market education 
conference held at the CME 
Group. CME Group offers a 
variety of risk management 
education. Not only do they 
throw this contest for univer-
sity students, but they also 
provide educational tools on 
the ?nance business.
“CQG is proud to partner 
with CME for the annual CME 
Group Trading Challenge,” 
Stan Yabroff, product special-
ist at CQG said. “The Chal-
lenge continues our commit-
ment of providing the next 
generation of traders and uni-
versity students from around 
the world with real-time trad-
ing opportunities in a dynamic 
trading environment. We 
would like to honor the win-
ning teams and congratulate 
the all the almost-600 teams 
that participated for continu-
ing this great tradition.”

Special to The Tartan
Editor’s Note: Dominique 
Escandon is the Cabinet 
Writer of The Student 
Government. 
As buggies are brought 
back to workshops, booths are 
torn down, and mass amounts 
of Gatorade are ingested, 
Carnegie Mellon is being 
brought back from Carnival 
into impending-?nals reality. 
With only a few weeks to go 
before the end of the school, 
it can be intimidating to think 
about what the new year will 
bring and what opportuni-
ties will arise. If you’ve found 
yourself wanting to get more 
involved with addressing the 
needs of the student body, 
look into serving in a posi-
tion in student government 
next year!
Maybe after hearing about 
and voting in the second Stu-
dent Senate elections, you feel 
inspired by our government’s 
dedication to properly inform 
the student body and want to 
learn more about how Senate 
impacts lives on campus. May-
be you feel like the second 
election was super?uous and 
want to make a change. Con-
sider getting involved with 
the Undergraduate Student 
Senate!
Within the Senate, 
two positions can be held: 
Member-at-Large and Sena-
tor. Both can be involved in 
general body meetings and 
Senate Committees, and 
Senators are able to vote in 
general body proceedings. 
Within Senate, there are 
seven committees: Academic 
Affairs, Business Affairs, Cam-
pus Life, Communications, Fi-
nance, Internal Development, 
and Advocacy. Each investi-
gates how to expand student 
power on campus in their re-
spective categories (with the 
exception of Internal Devel-
opment, which works on cre-
ating a more uni?ed Senate). 
Vacancy elections will be held 
in the fall to ful?ll open seats 
in each college, so make sure 
to keep a look out for those if 
you’re interested in running as 
a Senator! To be a member-at-
large, you must attend three 
senate general body meetings 
and then get nominated by a 
current senator.
Interested in student 
government’s legislative 
branch but you aren’t an un-
dergraduate student? Check 
out the Graduate Student As-
sembly (GSA), comprised of 
student representatives from 
each program and totaling 
over 90 members. If interest-
ed, speak with your Graduate 
Program Coordinator to learn 
more about how GSA repre-
sentatives are chosen for your 
program!
If your interests lie more 
directly with how the Univer-
sity allocates the $1.5 million 
funded by your Student Ac-
tivities Fee to over 300+ orga-
nizations on campus, maybe 
the Joint Funding Committee 
is the right place for you. This 
is headed by the Student Body 
Vice President of Finance. 
Please contact sbvpf@andrew.
cmu.edu if you’d like to get in-
volved as a ?nancial liaison to 
organizations on campus.
Maybe you’re more 
interested in the organiza-
tions that make up the Uni-
versity itself. The Committee 
of Student Organizations 
(CoSO) processes, recogniz-
es, and re-recognizes organi-
zations to our community. If 
you want to learn more about 
how to support and advocate 
the needs of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s student organizations to 
student government, SLICE, 
and University administra-
tion, contact sbvpo@andrew.
cmu.edu to learn more about 
CoSO’s weekly meetings.
Along with the Commit-
tee of Student Organiza-
tions, our Vice President of 
Organizations also chairs the 
University Center Allocations 
Board, which determines 
how space in the Cohon Cen-
ter is distributed to different 
organizations, and the Col-
laborative Funding Commit-
tee, which ensures one-on-
one application assistance 
with the common-funding-
application.
Wherever your interests 
fall, there’s a place in student 
government where you can 
use those interests to aid the 
greater Carnegie Mellon com-
munity. For more informa-
tion, feel free to explore our

protest the existence of nuclear 
weapons. She remarked that 
the good thing that came 
out of it is that the American 
stockpile has been reduced 
from 60,000 nuclear weapons 
during the height of the Cold 
War to 15,000 today. The pro-
tests in 1982 forced Reagan 
to talk with the Soviets and 
come up with an agreement 
to destroy nuclear weapons. 
Some of these materials were 
used for nuclear power plants. 
Yet this decommissioning of 
nuclear weapons has reversed 
for a few reasons — there are 
more countries with nuclear 
weapons now (nine instead of 
two), terrorists have increased 
interest in attaining them, and 
there has been a rise of new 
U.S.-Russia tensions.
Pume brought up an issue 
that she said “rarely comes up 
in discussions” about nuclear 
weapons: the President is not 
legally required to consult with 
anyone before he launches a 
nuclear strike, because nuclear 
weapons are on “high alert” 
status. She believes that peo-
ple now are less aware of the 
nuclear threat than they were 
during the Cold War, and one 
of her goals as an activist is to 
raise awareness among the 
public on this issue.
Despite criticizing Trump for 
being unstable and unpredict-
able, Plame said that the presi-
dent can lead the world into nu-
clear disarmament if he decides 
to. She suggested a few policies 
the president could change to 
lessen the nuclear threat, such 
as changing the high-alert status 
of nuclear weapons and chang-
ing the policy of nuclear-striking 
anyone who uses nuclear weap-
ons in the world.
She also discussed 
cybersecurity, which is in-
creasingly important as we 
become more connected than 
ever before. As an example 
of how much of a threat poor 
cybersecurity can pose, she cit-
ed the example of a bank whose 
computer system was hijacked 
in a sophisticated attack that 
took over the systems and ob-
tained a lot of con?dential infor-
mation. She offered an analysis 
on why some hostile parties act 
the way they do: Russia to carve 
out a sphere of in?uence, China 
because it is behind the U.S., 
Iran because it wants to be a rev-
olutionary (she believes the deal 
is essential to keeping Iran from 
disrupting the US more), North 
Korea because it is starving for 
attention, and terrorists because 
they’re just hateful. She believes 
the Sony and Democratic Party 
hacks were in?uence opera-
tions, and that in terms of cyber 
attacks, it just keeps escalating 
and there is little deterrence in 
play.
As a way to tackle cyberse-
curity issues, she said that the 
government must support the 
private sector more instead of 
making them comply with or-
ders from the Department of 
Defense. This way, it would be 
easier to cooperate in the event 
of a cyber-threat and make use 
of the advantages that the pri-
vate and public sector each have.
During her conclusion, 
Plume asserted that we are 
living in unprecedented times. 
While we often shake our heads 
at every blunder — she gave 
the examples of Sean Spicer’s 
botched comparison of Hitler 
and Assad and United’s violent 
removal of a passenger from an 
overbooked ?ight — this leads 
us to lose sight of the real threats 
out there. She called for more 
diplomacy and increased citizen 
engagement and knowledge 
in regards to social issues. She 
also encouraged young people 
to explore public service as a 
potential career, despite lower 
pay and what she termed her 
“crazy story.”
CMU announces commencement speaker Whitman and honorary degree recipients 
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
On May 21, over 5,000 
bachelors, masters, and doc-
toral degrees will be given to 
students at Carnegie Mellon’s 
2017 commencement cer-
emony. In addition to these

Keaton in a university press 
release. “As my career path 
led me away from graduating 
college, I am fortunate to be 
able to ‘spread my wings’ with 
the class of 2017.”
Bernard Osher, who 
started the Bernard Osher 
Foundation in 1977 to im-
prove the quality of life for 
higher education and the 
arts, will receive a Doctor of 
Humane Letters degree.

Klatzy and Morgan elected to Academy of Arts and Sciences
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
Roberta Klatzky, the 
Charles J. Queenan Pro-
fessor of Psychology at 
Carnegie Mellon, and M. 
Granger Morgan, the Uni-
versity and Hamerschlag 
Professor of Engineering, 
have been elected to the 
American Academy of Arts 
and Sciences. They will now 
join 22 other Carnegie Mel-
lon members also elected to 
the Academy.
“The American Academy 
serves the nation as a cham-
pion of scholarship, civil 
dialogue, and useful knowl-
edge,” as stated on its web-
site. “As one of the country’s 
oldest learned societies and 
independent policy research 
centers, the Academy con-
venes leaders from the aca-
demic, business, and gov-
ernment sectors to respond 
to the challenges facing the 
nation and the world.”
Klatzky is famous for 
examining the relationship 
between human perception 
and action. She investigates 
sensory and symbolic mo-
dalities in real and virtual 
environments. Her research 
has been instrumental to the 
development of telemanipu-
lation, image-guided sur-
gery, navigation aids for the 
blind and neural rehabilita-
tion. She became interested 
in perception while study-
ing math at the University of 
Michigan. She believes that 
her background in math has 
been invaluable, especially 
as it applies to her work 
with her collaboration with 
researchers in engineering 
and the life sciences.
Morgan holds positions in 
the Engineering and Public 
Policy (EPP) Department, 
Electrical and Computer En-
gineering Department, and 
Heinz College of Information 
Systems and Public Policy. 
He also serves as co-director 
of the Center for Climate 
and Energy Decision Making 
and the Electricity Industry 
Center. He was the found-
ing head of the EPP Depart-
ment for 38 years and was 
the founding director of the 
Wilton E. Scott Institute for 
Energy Innovation.
Morgan’s research focuses 
on problems in science, tech-
nology and public policy. He 
places particular focus on 
energy, environmental sys-
tems, climate change and 
risk analysis. His work in-
volves developing methods 
to characterize and treat 
uncertainty in quantitative 
policy analysis.
“In a tradition reaching 
back to the earliest days of 
our nation, the honor of 
election to the American 
Academy is also a call to ser-
vice,” said Academy Presi-
dent Jonathan F. Fanton. 
“Through our projects, pub-
lications, and events, the 
Academy provides members 
with opportunities to make 
common cause and produce 
the useful knowledge for 
which the Academy’s 1780 
charter calls.”
Klatzky, Morgan, and 
the rest of the new mem-
bers to the Academy will 
be inducted on Oct. 7 in 
Cambridge, MA.
“As one of the country’s 
oldest learned societies and 
independent policy research 
centers, the Academy convenes 
leaders from the academic, 
business, and government 
sectors to respond to the 
challenges facing the nation and 
the world.”

Since March, over a hundred gay 
men in Russia’s Chechnya region 
have been targeted, detained, and 
secretly tortured because of their 
sexuality. Located in southern Russia 
and in a historically homophobic re-
gion, Chechnya is a place where gay 
men have been forced to hide their 
identity, often through getting mar-
ried to women and starting a fam-
ily. But in a way, they still had some 
degrees of freedom: through some 
online chatrooms, they could con-
nect with others in the community 
who are also gay and interact with 
them anonymously. However, this 
channel has been turned into a trap 
to capture gay men in Chechnya in 
a new anti-gay program initiated by 
the region’s new pro-Kremlin leader 
Ramsan A. Kadyrov.
Homosexuality has long been a ta-
boo in Chechnya, because the major-
ity of residents believe in Islam and 
consider the existence of gay men to 
be in violation of their beliefs. Reli-
gion has long been used as the jus-
ti?cation for abuse of human rights 
of minority groups: in Western coun-
tries, Christians often justify the per-
secution of the LGBTQ population by 
using certain interpretations of pas-
sages from the Bible. Although much 
has changed in Europe and America 
in recent years and acceptance of 
the LGBTQ community is becoming 
more widespread, tolerating the use 
of religion as a means to justify such 
brutality in a region far from where 
we reside only diminishes the effort 
human rights groups have made in 
the past to ensure that LGBTQ rights 
are viewed no differently from the 
basic human rights that heterosexual 
people are afforded.
Although various activist groups 
and many human rights volunteers 
have expended effort to evacuate 
Chechen gay men from the region, 
the amount of protection they could 
guarantee the LGBTQ population is 
limited without intervention from 
other countries. The United States 
government has not only failed to 
stand up and condemn such viola-
tion of basic human rights, but also 
chose to not address such a problem.
Nikki Haley, United Nations 
ambassador who represented the 
United States, was the highest U.S. 
government of?cial to comment on 
this event. She described the de-
tainment and abuse of Chechen gay 
men as “[the opening of the] ?rst 
concentration camp for homosexu-
als since Hitler’s in the 1930s where 
campaigners say gay men are being 
tortured with electric shocks and 
beaten to death.” However, other 
high-ranking government of?cials 
have neglected to so much as com-
ment on the situation, making it 
clear that they cannot be counted on 
to take a stand against the violence 
and hatred.
The United States’ choice to not 
intervene is eerily similar to the of-
?cial response from the Russian 
government regarding this matter. 
When asked about the policy that 
led to this prosecution, Mr. Kadyrov 
responded, “I can of?cially say there 
is no policy because there is no prob-
lem. If there were a problem, there 
would be a policy.” But there is a 
problem, and the persecution that 
gay men are facing in Chechnya is 
only one manifestation of it: LGBTQ 
individuals are still seen as less-
deserving of basic human rights in 
many places and situations.
We are privileged to live in the 
United States at this time, where 
much of the road to equality has 
already been paved for us. But this 
does not mean our job is done: In-
stead of being a fundamental human 
right, LGBTQ rights are still not uni-
versal, because they have not been 
widely recognized or addressed in 
many countries around the world, 
especially in majority-Muslim coun-
tries and those that were previously 
communist — or even in parts of our 
own country.
The fact that the United States 
has neglected and refused to com-
ment on this problem re?ects the do-
mestic problem with LGBTQ rights. 
Since President Donald Trump was 
elected, the protection of the LGBTQ 
population in the workplace has 
been weakened.
Though claiming to support the 
LGBTQ community, Trump exclud-
ed transgender individuals from 
a much-needed protection thanks 
to his position on the transgender 
bathroom case. In addition, Trump 
has cut funding from AIDS and HIV 
research and treatment, among 
other protections for the LGBTQ 
community.
Hillary Clinton, former presiden-
tial candidate, spoke about the lack 
of response from the United States 
government on this matter, and the 
consequences of letting such brutal-
ity slide. “We may not ever be able 
to count on this administration to 
lead on LGBT issues,” said Clinton. 
But she continues to maintain that 
“gay rights are human rights,” and 
believes that the government has a 
duty to take a stand.
The danger of neglecting this is-
sue does not only affect gay men 
thousands of miles away, but also 
to the currently established human 
rights within Western countries. By 
allowing Russian government of?-
cials to treat gay men like subhumans 
and deny their existence, we let them 
downgrade the importance of such 
a basic human right that should be 
universally applied to simply a poli-
cy in the United States or particular 
countries. This toleration also allows 
for people of dominant religions to 
persecute and discriminate against 
groups of other humans. The silence 
of the United States in this matter is 
no different than permission for such 
brutality to go forward.

Torture of gay men in Chechnya must be condemned

President Donald Trump’s plans 
have not been made without op-
position. One of his controversial 
moves involves his budget plan. This 
new budget cuts funding for science 
research and ultimately shifts our 
research priorities away from envi-
ronmental and climate programs. 
Programs, including but not lim-
ited to the Environmental Protection 
Agency (EPA) and the National 
Institutes of Health (NIH), ?nd them-
selves having to conduct cutting-edge 
research with far less funds than ever 
before.
Trump is not known as the most 
environmentally-conscientious poli-
tician to enter the scene. In 2012, 
Trump used his Twitter to publicly 
announce “the concept of global 
warming was created by and for 
the Chinese in order to make U.S. 
manufacturing non-competitive.” Al-
though he denies tweeting this now, 
it is clear that he continues to deny 
the importance of funding scienti?c 
research. The Trump administra-
tion plans on rolling back the Clean 
Water Rule, which currently protects 
streams and wetlands, thus negative-
ly impacting public health, communi-
ties, and the economy, in the name of 
“promoting economic growth.” Scott 
Pruitt, Trump’s EPA Chief, rejects 
carbon dioxide’s impact on climate 
change.
The science community, as well 
as many other allies, congregated 
all over the world on April 22 to 
show the exigence for science fund-
ing. Thousands marched in the main 
march held in Washington D.C., and 
thousands more marched here in 
Pittsburgh. This sister march began 
near the Cathedral of Learning at the 
University of Pittsburgh.
The focus of the chants mainly 
circulated around climate change; 
the protesters could be heard cheer-
ing “climate justice cannot wait.” 
Posters criticized the Trump admin-
istration in various ways. Some post-
ers parodied Trump and some of his 
iconic quotes; one poster read “grab 
‘em by the data,” and another read 
“make America think again.” Others 
displayed posters that parodied the 
administration; one stated “there is 
no alternative to facts.”
Some protesters expressed near 
disbelief in the need for a march for 
science; one poster identi?ed a Ph.D. 
student who “should be writing my 
thesis ... but instead I have to tell 
our president that science is real,” 
and a few other protesters held post-
ers stating they “can’t believe I have 
to march for this.” Many marchers, 
furthermore, used their posters to 
criticize the administration’s erasure 
of the existence of climate change, 
which led the mantra “science, not 
silence” to emerge.
Guest speakers included re-
searchers af?liated with Chatham 
University, the University of Pitts-
burgh, and Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. Although each speaker present-
ed the urgency and need for funding 
in the sciences, each approached in 
unique angles.
Dr. Judy Yanowitz of Magee-
Womens Research Institute testi?ed 
the importance of funding when it 
came to groundbreaking research in 
epigenetics and discoveries in meio-
sis. Andrew Norman, philosophy pro-
fessor at Carnegie Mellon University, 
took a more humanistic approach by 
calling the audience to think more 
critically about reason and science.
Robert Coulter, a doctoral candi-
date at the University of Pittsburgh’s 
Graduate School of Public Health, 
shared how a lack of funding for the 
sciences is a disservice to the LGBTQ 
community in his speech. The lack 
of funding, Coulter argued, limits 
the bounds for scienti?c research 
and thus does not permit important 
health studies to expand very far.
Science is responsible for our in-
novations and technologies. Without 
it, society as a whole would not exist. 
Generations have seen the impact of 
science: over the years, life expec-
tancy has increased signi?cantly, and 
child mortality rates are at an all-
time low.
However, this is just the begin-
ning. With the proper funding and 
resources, today’s scientists may be 
able to make breakthroughs that in-
novate this country and ultimately 
this world. Perhaps these ?ndings 
will allow America to be a more envi-
ronmentally sustainable country, or 
maybe the clinical studies will lead us 
closer to a cure for cancer. However, 
if we cut funding, we tragically re-
duce the chance to give our country 
the opportunity to push the boundar-
ies of status quo and thus we cannot 
make America great again.

March for Science shows importance of scienti?c advancement
Meg Whitman is out of touch with ideals CMU should value
JEREMY GOLDSTEIN
Staffwriter
Meg Whitman, the president and 
CEO of Hewlett Packard Enterprise 
and former president and CEO of 
eBay, was just announced as the 2017 
Carnegie Mellon University com-
mencement speaker. Although she 
has had an impressive career, the 
selection of Whitman, described in 
the announcement as “a pathbreak-
ing leader in industry and politics,” 
goes to show that the university is 
living up to its namesake by honoring 
a captain of industry whose practices 
and politics have consistently under-
mined the labor rights and well-being 
of workers on an international stage. 
The choice of Whitman is out of 
touch insofar as it ignores the sources 
and tensions of today’s political and 
social crisis while also ignoring and 
instead praising the root of the mind-
shattering stress culture at Carnegie 
Mellon.
The Whitman choice seems jaded, 
especially considering recent political 
developments. People like Whitman 
are responsible for subverting public 
faith in institutions, including those 
of science, when they con?ate tech-
nological advancement, scienti?c 
truth, and pro?t motive. When they 
advocate for deregulation, lower 
taxes, and anti-union policies, they 
exacerbate educational, occupation-
al, and economic inequality, creat-
ing the scenario in which a populist, 
overtly anti-science president can be 
elected in a backlash to such corpo-
rat-dominated elitism.
In the United States, lack of access 
to education and the student debt cri-
sis along with failing public schools 
in many regions has led to the tragic 
creation of a poor, uneducated class 
that is mistrustful of the science of 
a wealthy, educated class who often 
enact policies without any consider-
ation to the well-being of the worse 
off.
The politics of Whitman are the 
politics of free market meritocracy, 
where the supposed “best and bright-
est” get the job. This thinking has, for 
better or worse, seen a vast economic 
shift away from employment in union 
jobs in the United States (50 years 
ago a third of Americans were em-
ployed in unions, today it is 1 in 10). 
Unions might have had the downside 
of protecting “slackers” as much as 
ef?cient employees, but ensured a 
pillar for the defense of all workers in 
the long term power dynamic against 
management.
New economy jobs are largely 
driven by the development of the 
technology and innovation sectors, 
where employees compete for jobs 
based on how much education they 
have and are often grateful to their 
employer just to be employed. Even if 
there are certain bene?ts to fairness 
under meritocracy, such a system 
does not address systemic issues of 
inequality, nor does it deal with the 
fact that intellect and abilities are 
not dispersed in a uniform manner, 
which leaves to waste a great deal of 
human potential that is not cookie-
cut to ?t into an academic, corporate 
suit.
After the Democratic Party lost 
in 1968 to Richard Nixon, the post-
mortem McGovern Commission 
switched from the traditional la-
bor union based demography of the 
Democratic Party and target young-
er, college-educated professionals 
whose social values were generally 
more progressive on issues like the 
Vietnam War and support for wom-
en’s reproductive rights. This has led 
to what amounts to a nominally so-
cially progressive though often anti-
labor “left” party that supports free 
trade (with exploitative outsourced 
labor) and subsidizes anti-union 
companies in public-private part-
nerships while abandoning the New 
Deal style ideas of government paid 
jobs, social programs, and defense of 
union rights.
The Democratic Party’s strategic 
shift also led to the perception of 
rural America and many poor, work-
ing class people as crude or racist. 
However, times have changed and 
fortunately race, though there are 
still many important issues to be re-
solved, is broadly on the downswing 
as a societal divider, and the attitude 
toward rural and working class peo-
ple should be that they are economi-
cally ignored and exploited, and that 
their needs should be met to help 
them be fully able to believe in the 
values of tolerance and the impor-
tance of science.
The fact that a corporate boss 
like Whitman switched from being 
a major Republican donor advocat-
ing for deregulation of her industry 
and lower taxes to being a major 
Hillary Clinton supporter while still 
likely pushing for the same policies 
demonstrates the elitist problem of 
the centrist establishment. A major 
reason for the leftist Bernie Sanders’ 
primary success against Clinton was 
because he wanted to get corporate 
money out of politics and it is the ac-
tions of Whitman that are the very 
representation of the corrupting ef-
fect big money has on our politics. 
The frustration with such corruption 
and the luxurious wealth of the elite 
compared to the struggle of ?nan-
cially insecure parents who have to 
tell their children that they cannot 
afford to send them to college is what 
leads to emotionally appealing dema-
gogues and con-men like Trump be-
ing elected.
The establishment cannot just 
lower taxes for itself and eliminate 
protections for workers and consum-
ers — causing the living standards 
of the middle class to continually 
drop — if they expect to be able to 
elect politically stable candidates like 
Clinton in the future. It must respond 
with New Deal style, Keynesian-
spending programs that guarantee a 
comfortable middle class living stan-
dard, rather than with elitist, corpo-
rate-written policies that eradicate 
the middle class living standard for 
all but an elite, educated, and lucky 
comparable few.
Besides casting Carnegie Mellon 
in an exorbitantly elitist light, the 
celebration of such an individual as 
Whitman displays a marked lack of 
concern about the root of the stress 
problem among students at Carnegie 
Mellon. Having special activities and 
events may help to boost students’ 
psychology, a common practice im-
plemented in Silicon Valley to make 
the workplace “more fun” for em-
ployees, but such practices cannot 
make up for the sheer amount of time 
and stress dedicated to maintaining 
coursework and extracurricular ac-
tivities, which are also a professional 
necessity. No one who is stressed out 
over time management has time to 
go to a time management workshop. 
Students do not have time to do fun 
things or seek out psychological help 
when there is so much work.
Now, I may just be stupider and 
lazier than every other student at 
Carnegie Mellon, but if I were to put 
my ?nger on the root of the stress, it 
is that the curriculum is too intense. 
This is because the jobs students pur-
sue are too intense because corporate 
bosses like Whitman are concerned 
with one thing, and that certainly is 
not the well-being of their workers. 
There is more to our lives than our 
work, but the paradigm at Carnegie 
Mellon and Silicon Valley has been 
to try to dress up work as fun, so 
that students and employees work as 
much as possible.
But maybe, just maybe, there is 
actually worth in not working as 
much as possible. And what is the 
great award for those of us who are 
able to run gauntlet and become 
meritorious, hard-working achiev-
ers like Whitman? The best case sce-
nario is to become CEOs or university 
presidents bent on in?icting the same 
damage upon a younger generation 
and continuing the vicious, elitist 
cycle until one generation ?nally 
stands up for itself and says it has had 
enough of being exploited and being 
taught to exploit.

Alabama is a state many of us do 
not consider much in politics. How-
ever, its history has undeniably left 
a signi?cant impact on our nation’s 
history. From Rosa Parks’ example 
of civil disobedience in Montgomery 
to marches at Selma that served as 
the catalyst for the enactment of the 
Voting Rights Amendment (VRA) to 
the Shelby County v. Holder court 
case that weakened some aspects of 
the VRA, Alabama has shown its im-
portance in American history.
The in?uence of the Heart of 
Dixie does not stop in our history 
books. Alabama’s current in?uence 
has been comically described as the 
“Alabama?cation of America” by the 
Harvard Political Review. Up until 
the 2016 election, Trump attempted 
to appeal to populist conservative 
ideas, which a large portion of states 
in the south hold. Former senator 
Jeff Sessions moved up to becom-
ing the 84th Attorney General of 
the United States. This so-called 
Alabama?cation is bound to expand 
and may sound pessimistic to many, 
but there actually may be a reason 
for hope.
Recently, a university in Alabama 
was the host of one potential historic 
moment. On April 18, white suprem-
acist Richard Spencer arrived at 
Auburn University to de?ne his term 
alt-right and defend the movement.
Spencer had a fair share of sup-
porters, which was shown through 
?iers calling for a “white student 
union.” However, Spencer was not 
without opposition. Auburn can-
celled the event just four days be-
fore the event and announced via 
Facebook that their reasons for do-
ing so were “based on legitimate 
concerns and credible evidence that 
it will jeopardize the safety of stu-
dents, faculty, staff and visitors.” 
Thus, Spencer took this to the Su-
preme Court of Alabama in Mont-
gomery, Alabama, claiming this was 
a violation of the First Amendment, 
and a federal judge stopped Auburn 
from barring Spencer from its cam-
pus. Twitter helped open the door 
for more people near the university 
to observe what was described as an 
equivalent to the recent protest in 
Berkeley, California.
Despite the fact Spencer leads a 
movement called the alt-right, it is 
not to be con?ated with traditional 
conservative values. He actually 
denounced conservatives for their 
“ability to lose themselves” for the 
name of a political party and rejected 
their “bulls**t abstract concepts like 
freedom.” He recognized that this 
movement that he leads is “so radi-
cal [and] ... dangerous.” However, 
he praised President Donald Trump 
as “a miracle” and merely a single 
“stop on this train” leading to his vi-
sion. He is “a racial idealist;” a “race 
realist,” he argues, “would accept the 
way it is.”
In his forty minute speech, one 
of the ?rst things he addressed was 
the First Amendment — speci?-
cally, freedom of speech. Although 
freedom of speech is what allowed 
his presence despite the university’s 
wishes, Spencer actually dismissed 
the notion of “agree[ing] to dis-
agree” as “cute.” He recognized how 
radical his movement was, stating it 
“disrupts business as usual” and dis-
missed the iconic former Breitbart 
News journalist, Milo Yiannopoulos, 
as an example of “cute libertarian-
ism.” He even stated, “I understand 
why they protest us,” showing a de-
gree of empathy for his opponents. 
He understood those protesting feel 
as strongly about freedom of speech 
and diversity as he feels about na-
tionalism and combating diversity, 
which was earlier de?ned as “code 
word for anti-white” when he was 
being introduced prior to his speech.
Although there was a standing 
ovation at the end of his speech, it 
was clear that his views were held by 
the minority. His stances on “mak-
ing white privilege great again” and 
idea of transforming the U.S. into an 
Aryan homeland by using what he 
describes as “peaceful ethnic cleans-
ing” have been nothing short of con-
troversial, and this came to show in 
the reception of both his presence 
and his beliefs.
When Spencer stated that he 
envied the black community in 
America for even having a commu-
nity, thus claiming it is “so much eas-
ier being black [than being white],” 
a voice in the audience replies with 
“what do you know about being 
black?” Although a signi?cant por-
tion of the audience laughed in re-
sponse, this person was not the only 
one in that audience who opposed 
his views. Throughout the question 
and answer session several people 
who thanked him for coming started 
their sentiment by explicitly stat-
ing that they did not agree with his 
worldview, but several more racial 
minorities confronted him. A black 
woman emotionally asked for him to 
state “challenges that white people 
face that I [as a black woman in a 
predominately white institute] don’t 
face.” Spencer did not verbally reply; 
some of the audience shouted indis-
tinguishable answers whereas some 
of them cheered.
His opponents were not just in the 
room; they were active before and 
after the event. Prior to his speech, 
a ?ght between Spencer supporters 
and Spencer protesters broke out, 
which involved at least three arrests. 
Aside of the one incident, the pro-
tests were generally peaceful, and 
many witnesses con?rm that police 
were readily available in case of vio-
lence. After the protest, there were 
hundreds more waiting for Spencer 
outside, which led to them chasing 
a handful of supporters off campus.
The Alabama?cation of America 
might have been daunting for many 
in the U.S. As a girl who grew up 
in Alabama, it was jarring to see 
Alabama’s in?uence on the U.S. 
through a new lens. I saw how this 
pivotal state interacted with other 
states as a part of the United States 
and how imperative it is in writing 
history. Richard Spencer has no in-
tention of stopping at Auburn — he 
announced he would embark on a 
college tour, although he has yet to 
release a schedule publicly. Further-
more, these protests that the city of 
Auburn carried out was more than 
another protest; it potentially dem-
onstrates the trajectory of this coun-
try.
There is, without a doubt, room 
for improvement in not only Alabama 
but also in the United States as a 
whole, but there are hundreds of stu-
dents who agree that, as one poster 
read, “tolerance does not mean tol-
erating intolerance.” A generation of 
college students stand by the belief 
that America should “make empathy 
great again.” This top-100 ranked 
state university comes to demon-
strate that there may be hope in what 
is described as the “Alabama?cation” 
of America; education, empathy, and 
free speech opened the doors to al-
low a chance for a more inclusive 
society.

EMMETT ELDRED
I’d like to begin this column by 
stating that I am unequivocally pro-
choice. This is an extremely impor-
tant aspect of the Democratic Party’s 
platform. Beyond securing in the ab-
stract a woman’s right to control her 
own body, the right to choose is an 
essential component of personal lib-
erty and economic justice. Societies 
are more free, more safe, and more 
prosperous when women have full 
reproductive rights. I believe that 
anti-choice politicians are wrong 
scienti?cally, factually, and morally. 
Not just that, but anti-choice poli-
cies have proven time and again to 
be ineffective, repressive, and usu-
ally counter-intuitive. We should 
all work very hard to educate voters 
and politicians about the impor-
tance of reproductive health care 
so that one day the right to have an 
abortion is no longer a controversial 
or politicized issue. 
Now to alienate myself from all 
my fellow pro-choice readers. This 
week, Senator Bernie Sanders (I–
VT) received some negative atten-
tion from Democrats for endorsing 
and campaigning for Heath Mello, 
an anti-choice Democrat who is 
running to be the mayor of Omaha, 
NE. Mello, who is in the Nebraska 
State Legislature, has co-sponsored 
several pieces of anti-choice legisla-
tion. I don’t agree with Mello’s posi-
tion on abortion, but I’m glad Sand-
ers is supporting him. Democrats 
should follow Sanders’ lead and 
support Mello and other anti-choice 
Democrats campaigning in places 
where only anti-choice candidates 
can win right now. 
Here’s a sad political reality: 
Democrats have a huge geographic 
disadvantage when it comes to poli-
tics. Increasingly, Democrats are 
cloistered in large cities, while vast 
swaths of land in rural regions are 
overrun with Republicans. Unfortu-
nately, our political system doesn’t 
just reward the number of voters 
you have, but the amount of land 
you control as well. This is how it’s 
possible that more people voted 
for Democratic candidates for Sen-
ate, House of Representatives, and 
President in 2016, yet all three are 
controlled by Republicans. And this 
is how a majority of Americans can 
support a woman’s right to choose, 
yet Democrats lose in large part be-
cause of their stance on abortion. 
If Democrats ever want to regain 
power in Washington and in state 
and local of?ces around the United 
States, they need to learn how to 
connect with rural voters. And if 
Democrats ever want to connect 
with rural voters again, they need to 
run candidates that can win in rural 
areas. It’s an often repeated but emi-
nently true adage: all politics is lo-
cal. As someone who comes from an 
extremely conservative rural area, 
I know that most rural voters will 
never, ever vote for a candidate who 
vocally supports a woman’s right to 
choose, at least not until the politi-
cal conversation surrounding abor-
tion changes dramatically. Abortion 
is an emotional issue, and it is a deal 
breaker for many rural voters. They 
genuinely believe that abortion is 
murder. They are wrong, but that’s 
what they believe. And we’re simply 
naive if we believe that we will ever 
get voters to support a candidate 
who they think endorses murder. 
Now just because that’s the cur-
rent political reality doesn’t mean 
that this is an acceptable state of af-
fairs. Democrats and reproductive 
rights advocates should continue to 
educate the public about abortion 
and the scienti?c and moral reasons 
why access to abortion is such an im-
portant right. We shouldn’t simply 
cede the argument because the oth-
er side is so emotional and irrational 
about it. Eventually, Democrats will 
win this argument, and abortion 
will no longer be a controversial or 
politicized topic.
Until that day comes, Democrats 
need to embrace a strategy that will 
help us win today. This means en-
couraging anti-choice Democrats to 
run in areas where only anti-choice 
candidates can win. Our choice 
is not between getting pro-choice 
and anti-choice candidates elected. 
When it comes to elections in rural 
areas, our choice is between anti-
choice Democrats who will stand 
with the party on issues like work-
er’s rights, economic justice, health-
care, environmental protection, LG-
BTQ rights, racial justice, and other 
aspects of women’s rights like equal 
pay, or anti-choice Republicans who 
will support none of the above. 
But let’s say that your top issue is 
a woman’s right to choose. Instead 
of blasting Sanders for support-
ing Mello like NARAL Pro-Choice 
America did, even voters that care 
?rst and foremost about abortion 
rights should still support and wel-
come anti-choice Democrats. Why? 
First, because anti-choice Demo-
crats can rehabilitate the Demo-
cratic Party’s name and reputation 
among rural voters. In many rural 
areas, the word “Democrat” is prac-
tically synonymous with “abortion.” 
But anti-choice Democrats intro-
duce rural voters to other aspects 
of the Democratic platform that 
they’ll like and want to continue 
supporting. Eventually, rural vot-
ers who vote for local anti-choice 
Democrats may become more com-
fortable with voting for Democrats 
at the top of the ticket, even if they 
are pro-choice. Think of anti-choice 
Democrats as a “gateway drug” for 
rural voters to become comfortable 
voting for all Democrats. 
Second, staunchly pro-choice or-
ganizations and voters should still 
support anti-choice Democrats in 
rural areas because whichever party 
is in power sets the agenda. Let’s 
say that there are 240 Democrats 
in the House of Representatives, 
but thirty of those Democrats are 
anti-choice. This means that Demo-
crats have a majority in Congress, 
but it also means that a majority of 
members of Congress oppose abor-
tion rights. Nonetheless, because 
Democrats control the House of 
Representatives, they control which 
bills come to the ?oor of the House 
for a vote. Since Democrats control 
the House, and most Democrats are 
pro-choice, the House won’t vote on 
anti-choice legislation. If Democrats 
had instead tried to run pro-choice 
candidates for those thirty seats, 
they would have lost those seats to 
Republicans. Now, there are still the 
same number of anti-choice mem-
bers of Congress, but Republicans 
hold the majority, so they set the 
agenda and bring anti-choice legis-
lation to the ?oor. In Mello’s case, 
he has vowed not to restrict wom-
en’s access to abortion as Omaha’s 
mayor, while his opponent will seek 
to do just that. Running pro-choice 
candidates in areas where pro-
choice candidates simply cannot 
win ultimately harms women and 
the right to choose by handing pow-
er to anti-choice Republicans.
It feels nice to demand purity, 
especially on issues as important 
as the right to choose. In a perfect 
world in which voters acted on rea-
son instead of emotion and science 
instead of faith, abortion wouldn’t 
be a controversial or politicized is-
sue. But this isn’t that world. When 
Democrats demand that their candi-
dates toe the party line on abortion, 
they are shutting themselves out of 
otherwise winnable races. When 
Democrats excoriate people like 
Sanders who understand that get-
ting progressives into of?ce is more 
important that supporting doomed 
candidates who agree with them 
on every point, they divide their 
party and only hurt themselves. 
Democrats have always been a big 
tent party full of diverse opinions, 
perspectives, and approaches. We 
win because we are for people, not 
because we’re in lockstep on every 
issue. Instead of criticizing Sanders 
for backing Mello, Democrats ev-
erywhere, including even the most 
enthusiastic pro-choice voters and 
organizations, need to join Sanders, 
because his is a winning strategy.

Arti?cial intelligence 
(AI) can be just as biased as 
humans, according to a new 
study by researchers from 
Princeton University’s Center 
for Information Technology 
Policy. The study, published 
April 13 in Science Magazine, 
uncovered racial and gen-
der bias in a prominent ma-
chine learning algorithm 
— Stanford University’s 
Global Vectors for Word 
Representation, or GLoVe, 
which learns to associate 
related words and concepts 
by studying words all across 
the internet.
AI ?nds patterns in real-
world texts, and develops 
the biases present in those 
materials. Bias in machine 
learning algorithms often 
takes the form of language 
patterns. The program 
associated words and 
concepts in ways that turn 
out to be sexist or racist. 
For example, the program 
associated women with the 
household and family, but 
not professional or career 
diction. The bias got even 
more detailed: “man” was 
linked with “professor”, while 
“woman” was connected with 
“assistant professor.”
While previous research 
on AI bias has shown similar 
results, this study is the ?rst 
to integrate psychological 
research and human bias. 
The researchers tested GLoVE 
with a method traditionally 
used to detect human 
bias, called the Implicit 
Association Test (IAT). “In the 
IAT, subjects are presented 
with two images — say, a 
white man and a black man 
— and words like ‘pleasant’ 
or ‘unpleasant,’” explains 
science writer Angela Chen. 
“The IAT calculates how 
quickly you match up ‘white 
man’ and ‘pleasant’ versus 
‘black man’ and ‘pleasant.’”
The idea is that the 
longer it takes to match up 
concepts, the more trouble 
the test-taker has associating 
them; however, instead of 
measuring response time 
in humans, the researchers 
measured the mathematical 
distance between concepts in 
the algorithm, with a smaller 
distance corresponding to a 
stronger association. They 
found, as expected, several 
associations re?ecting 
human bias. GLoVe learned 
to consider black names less 
pleasant than white names, 
and to associate women with 
the arts but not with the 
sciences.
AI will soon have a huge 
impact in everyday life. 
Currently, machine learning 
algorithms control a wide 
range of processes, from 
making Google Translate 
more accurate to deciding 
whose résumés get passed 
on to hiring departments. 
Bias in algorithms like these 
could potentially have dire 
consequences for a large 
number of people.
“Language is a bridge to 
ideas and a lot of algorithms 
are built on language 
in the real world,” says 
Megan Garcia, an expert on 
algorithmic bias. “So unless 
an algorithm is making 
a decision based only on 
numbers, this ?nding is going 
to be important. [Computer] 
bias is everywhere we look.”
Machine learning is 
a type of AI that enables 
computers to learn and adapt 
without explicitly being 
programmed. It relies on 
large amounts of data intake 
as the computer experiences. 
It’s understandable that 
a computer would mimic 
gender and racial bias 
because humans are 
known to consciously and 
subconsciously display these 
tendencies. This does not 
mean that the AI is at fault 
— it actually shows that the 
program is working just as 
it should. What this does 
suggest is that we, as humans, 
have a long way to go to rid 
ourselves of unjust biases  in 
thinking and writing.

AI learns to predict heart attacks better than doctors do
INDIA PRICE
Editor-in-Chief
A set of algorithms, 
developed by researchers at 
the University of Nottingham 
in the United Kingdom, can 
predict which patients are 
most at risk of a heart attack 
or stroke at over 75 percent 
accuracy. Although you may 
feel like this number should 
be even higher, it is already 
nearly 8 percent above the 
average accuracy level of 
highly trained doctors.
In the United States 
alone, someone has a heart 
attack every 34 seconds. 
Globally, 20 million people 
die each year as a result 
of heart attacks, strokes, 
or other cardiovascular or 
circulatory malfunctions. 
Although doctors are capable 
of determining which 
individuals are at risk of 
developing heart disease 
and other cardiovascular 
problems, determining when 
an individual may suffer from 
one is much more dif?cult.
An epidemiologist at the 
University of Nottingham, 
Stephen Weng, explained 
why it is often challenging 
for doctors to make accurate 
predictions. The human body 
is an intricate, complex, ever-
developing system with a 
great deal of counterintuitive 
functions. For example, 
doctors use high body fat 
content as a red ?ag indicating 
that the individual may be 
at risk of heart disease; how-
ever, in many cases, body fat 
becomes impermeable and 
can protect the heart against 
disease. Although it is dif?cult 
for a doctor to make these sort 
of predictions, Weng explained 
that the new AI algorithms can 
train themselves to explore 
and gain understanding about 
these nuances.
These AI algorithms are 
self-taught and continually 
using new data to make faster, 
smarter decisions without 
human instruction. Using 
nearly 300,000 available 
patient records from 2005, 
the algorithms create guide-
lines for themselves to predict 
which patients would have a 
heart attack or stroke within 
the next 10 years.
The algorithm began by 
using the ?rst 80 percent of 
the records as input data to 
make an initial rule book 
of sorts. When making the 
rule book, the algorithms 
considered metrics that 
doctors commonly use — age, 
weight, body fat content — 
in addition to categories the 
researchers thought may be 
interesting to examine, such 
as arthritis, kidney disease, 
or mental illness. The AI then 
tested its new rule book on the 
remaining data, improving the 
rules and making adjustments 
to optimize it’s prediction.
In addition to the AI making 
predictions with 8 percent 
more accuracy than doctors, 
it also made 1.6 percent 
fewer false predictions. If 
the algorithm had existed at 
the time, it could have saved 
355 deceased patients whose 
records it utilized during 
testing. These numbers are 
good, but researchers are 
determined to make the 
algorithm even better.
These machine-learning 
algorithms are dif?cult to 
adjust, however. Because 
the algorithm is self-
taught, it is dif?cult for the 
machine’s programmers to 
fully understand of all of its 
internal functionality. The 
programmers are hesitant to 
make large adjustments, fear-
ing that they may undo some 
of the learning and reverse 
some of the progress the 
machine has already made for 
itself.
The researchers at 
Nottingham worry that some 
doctors, who take pride in 
their hard-earned expertise, 
may be hesitant to adapt these 
machine-learning methods; 
however, if further testing 
continues and the AI is widely 
implemented in hospitals, the 
algorithm could start saving 
hundreds of thousands of lives 
every year.

Buggy races boast new, exciting, sleek designs at Carnival
Carnegie Mellon students 
have built and raced buggies 
for more than a century. 
Over the decades, designs 
have become more ef?cient 
and aesthetically pleasing. 
2017’s Spring Carnival saw 
a continuation of this trend. 
Nine organizations — namely 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC), Pi Kappa Alpha, 
Fringe, Sigma Phi Epsilon, 
CIA, Apex, Phi Delta Theta, 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, and 
SPIRIT — participated in the 
?rst set of heats.
Many teams’ buggies 
sported interesting paint 
jobs that conveyed fun 
messages. Technical designs 
were equally diverse. Even 
though all buggies had three 
wheels, some teams had two 
in the front and one in the 
back, while some teams had 
the opposite arrangement. 
The turning and breaking 
mechanisms in the buggies 
also varied from team to team.
Buggies were also very 
aerodynamic this year. All 
shells were modeled after the 
teardrop shape, making the 
buggies cut through the air 
and reduce drag. The fastest 
time was clocked by the SDC 
A team, with a time of 2:02.16.

HBO ?lm reignites debate about cell use in research
The new HBO ?lm The 
Immortal Life of Henrietta 
Lacks has reignited debate 
about unauthorized cell 
donation from patients. 
The ?lm, which stars Oprah 
Winfrey, chronicles the 
life of Henrietta Lacks, 
an impoverished African-
American in 1950s America.
Lacks had undergone 
surgery for cervical cancer at 
Johns Hopkins when her cells 
were sequenced, unbeknownst 
to her, for medical research. 
Her cells, named HeLa, 
demonstrated ‘immortal’ 
traits, being able to last and 
multiply for decades. HeLa 
has contributed tremendously 
to research in polio vaccines, 
chemotherapy, and in vitro 
fertilization. Lacks’ DNA has 
been copied as well, exposing 
her family’s genes to the 
medical world without her 
knowing.
The practice in medical 
research of taking patients’ 
cells without their permission 
has come under ?re. Laws 
do not allow direct medical 
research and testing on 
human beings, but these same 
laws are lenient when it comes 
to cell testing. The HBO ?lm 
premieres on April 23.

Adidas plans to sell shoes made of plastic ocean waste
Adidas has turned its 
focus towards sustainability 
and the mighty oceans. In 
collaboration with Parley, an 
organization concerned with 
ocean protection, Adidas will 
unveil Ultra Boost, Ultra Boost 
Uncaged, and Ultra Boost 
X, made mostly from ocean 
plastic waste.
About 11 bottles go into 
making each pair of shoes. 
The plastic is used for the new 
PrimeKnit mesh present on 
the upper side of new shoes. 
Overall, about 95 percent 
of shoes will be made from 
ocean waste. The sports-
wear company hopes to make 
a million pairs by the end 
of 2017. Adidas has signed 
contracts to do the same with 
soccer jerseys, although these 
will not be available to the 
public like the shoes are.
The shoes will sell on May 
10, starting at $200. Adidas’ 
efforts at sustainability will 
hopefully spur its competitors 
to follow suit, and reducing the 
planet’s non-biodegradable 
waste ever so slightly. Even 
though the shoes are made 
from trash, they look as sleek 
and appealing as previous 
versions. To some, it may even 
look better.

HOW THINGS WORK
Young’s double slit experiment revolutionized physics
ABHISHEK TAYAL
Layout Manager
One of the strangest 
experimental results ever 
observed is that of the 
single particle double slit 
experiment. It is one of the 
most stunning illustrations 
of how the quantum world 
is fundamentally different 
from the large scale world of 
our physical intuition. In fact, 
the double slit experiment 
suggests that the fundamental 
nature of reality may not be 
physical at all, at least not in 
any way that we perceive.
Let’s start with the simple. 
Imagine a single periodic 
wave, such as ripples on a lake. 
Some distance away, those 
waves encounter a barrier 
with two gaps cut in it. Most 
of the wave is blocked, but 
some ripples still pass through 
the gaps. When the ripples 
start to overlap each other on 
the other side, they produce 
a really interesting pattern 
known as an interference 
pattern that is observed on a 
screen. This happens because 
at some points, the peaks 
from the two ripples overlap 
to create higher peaks, and at 
other points the troughs of the 
ripples overlap to create even 
deeper troughs.
What makes this pattern 
so incredible is its universality 
— every type of wave, from 
water waves, to sound, to light 
waves, displays this pattern. 
The double slit interference 
of light was ?rst observed by 
Thomas Young in 1801. He 
found that a source of light 
passing through two very thin 
slits produces an interference 
pattern in the bands of dark 
and light stripes on a screen 
behind.
The complication is this 
— we also know that light 
comes in indivisible bundles of 
electromagnetic energy called 
photons, as demonstrated 
by Einstein through the 
photoelectric effect. So light is 
composed of discreet packets, 
but also displays wave 
phenomena! In the double 
slit experiment, each photon 
must decide which of the two 
slits to go through. It can’t 
split in half and recombine 
on the other side, because 
it’s discreet. What one should 
see, with the photon model 
of light, is two bright spots 
representing the photons that 
got through the slits, and total 
darkness otherwise. How does 
one reconcile what one sees, 
an interference pattern, with 
what is expected, two bright 
spots.
It turns out that if you ?re 
photons, one at a time, at a 
screen with two slits such 
that each photon has equal 
probability of passing through 
either of the two slits, then 
with time, on a screen behind, 
the re?ection points of the 
individual photons aggregate 
together, into denser and 
less dense areas, exactly 
like an interference pattern. 
The interference pattern 
has nothing to do with how 
each single photon’s energy 
is spread out, but how each 
photon dumps all of its energy 
at a single point. The pattern 
essentially emerges in the 
distribution of the photons 
themselves. 
Many completely unrelated 
photons must essentially know 
the ?nal positions of each 
other. Each photon has no 
idea where a previous photon 
landed or where any future 
photon will land, and must 
have a ?nal landing point that 
forms a pattern with all the 
others. How can that be?
It turns out that some even 
weirder things than photons 
have been shown to produce 
this interference pattern. 
Shoot electrons through a 
single pair of slits, and you’ll 
get the same result. This 
effect has even been observed 
with whole atoms and whole 
molecules. Buckminster 
Fullerine (Buckyballs), are 
gigantic molecules of 60 
carbon atoms, and have been 
observed to produce double 
slit interference.
We have to assume that the 
photon, electron, or Buckyball 
passes through both slits 
as a wave. That wave then 
interacts with itself to create 
an interference pattern. 
Except here, the peaks and 
troughs of that pattern are the 
regions where there is more 
or less a chance the particle 
will ?nd itself on the screen. It 
seems like a wave of unde?ned 
positions, that at some point, 
for some reason, resolves 
itself down to a single certain 
position. This distribution of 
possibilities is at the heart of 
quantum mechanics, and is 
governed by what is known as 
the probability wave function.
So what is a probability 
wave really made of? Well, we 
know where our wave particle 
is at the beginning and end 
of its journey. We know our 
particle’s starting point — a 
light source, electron-gun, 
or Buckyball launcher. And 
we know its end point — the 
screen, or rather, wherever it 
releases its energy. The particle 
seems more particle-like at 
the beginning and end, but 
more wave-like in between. 
That wave holds the informa-
tion about all the ?nal pos-
sible positions of the particle, 
and every possible position at 
every stage in the journey. In 
fact, the wave must map out 
all the possible paths that the 
particle could take. In essence, 
we have this in?nite fam-
ily of ‘could be’ trajectories, 
as opposed to a single known 
trajectory. For some reason, 
near either end, this family 
of possible outcomes resolves 
into a single trajectory.
Within the mysterious span 
between the creation and 
the detection, is the particle 
anything more than a space of 
possibility?

Light is the fastest thing 
in our universe. Its speed is 
a universal constant that no 
object with mass can attain or 
surpass. We know these truths 
thanks to Einstein and his 
brilliant theories of special and 
general relativity, published 
more than a hundred years 
ago.
There is one byproduct 
of Einstein’s theory that is 
surprising, perplexing, and 
unintuitive. The speed of light 
isn’t a cap solely on objects 
traveling in space, but also a 
limit on the propagation of 
information.
What is information? Is it 
the words in a textbook, the 
content of a coded message, 
a friend’s secret, a song, or 
ones and zeros in a computer? 
The answer is yes — those are 
all instances of information. 
Information to a physicist is 
anything that tells observers 
about the universe surround-
ing them.
Let’s consider you as an 
observer. You may be reading 
this article on a laptop, on 
a phone, or in print. Your 
eyes see its black text thanks 
to  light — the same light 
that has a ?nite speed. Now 
think about the world you see 
around you: plants, people, 
the sky, your hands. All that 
information is delivered to 
your eyes by light. So, your 
ability to receive information 
about what surrounds you is  
limited by the speed of light.
This becomes more obvious 
when distances become 
unimaginably large. The Sun 
is 93 million miles away from 
the Earth, so its light takes 
eight minutes to reach us. 
When we look up, we see the 
Sun as it was eight minutes 
ago. So, our information here 
is eight minutes late.
Our closest neighboring 
galaxy, Andromeda, is 2.5 
million light-years away, 
where one light-year is the 
distance light travels in a 
year — six trillion miles. So 
Andromeda is 2.5 million 
times six trillion miles away — 
that’s really, really far. Since 
it takes light 2.5 million years 
to reach us from Andromeda, 
we see it as it was 2.5 million 
years ago, when humans 
didn’t event exist. Now, our 
information is lagging behind 
by millions of years.
This effect increases as 
we look farther out into the 
universe. In fact, cosmologists 
look out far enough to view 
the universe as it was billions 
of years ago, close to the time 
of the Big Bang.
You’re probably wondering 
how the speed of information 
relates to, say, a song playing. 
Sound waves travel at a mere 
770 miles per hour, meaning 
it would take an observer an 
hour to hear the chords of a 
song playing 770 miles away. 
Obviously, as the distance 
increases, so does the lag time 
for the sound.
This phenomenon can be 
extended to anything you can 
think of. Imagine you and a 
friend are playing a game of 
tug of war with a rope one 
light-year long. You’re tugging 
with all your might, and so is 
your opponent. The speed of 
information tells us that, if 
the rope were to snap exactly 
down the middle, you and 
your opponent wouldn’t notice 
for half a year. You could still 
tug with all your weight and 
not fall, for six months.
And that’s because of the 
nature of tension, the force in 
a rope when it’s taut. Tension 
is the result of the object’s 
particles experiencing strain 
and relaying that stress to 
neighboring particles via 
bonds. Bonds are made from 
electrostatic interaction 
between electrons, and 
electromagnetism propagates 
at the speed of light.
No matter what, we can’t 
learn about an event faster 
than it takes light to travel. 
Nothing we observe or feel 
is truly instantaneous, even 
when it’s right in front of us.

SDC wins both men’s and women’s races in 98th Buggy
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
On Friday and Saturday, a 
fundamental Carnegie Mellon 
tradition continued, as student 
organizations competed in the 
98th edition of Buggy, formal-
ly known as Sweepstakes.
The race around Tech and 
Frew streets was dominated 
by the Student Dormitory 
Council (SDC), with both its 
men’s A and women’s A teams 
taking the victory while shat-
tering records on both days 
of competition. On the men’s 
side, SDC extended its win-
ning streak to six years, and 
on the women’s side, SDC re-
took the title after two years 
of Carnegie Involvement 
Association (CIA) victories.
The preliminary heats be-
gan on Friday morning with 
perfect weather conditions for 
racing. In addition to SDC’s 
stellar performances by men’s 
A and women’s A teams, three 
of SDC’s teams (A, B, and C) 
in both competitions quali?ed 
for the ?nals, repeating the 
same success from last year’s 
races.
Teams from Pi Kappa 
Alpha (PiKA), Sigma Phi 
Epsilon (SigEp), Phi Delta 
Theta (PhiDelt), CIA, Fringe, 
and Apex made the 12-team 
women’s ?nal, while teams 
from PiKA, SigEp, CIA, Fringe, 
and SPIRIT made the 10-team 
men’s ?nal. Like SDC, Fringe 
had its A, B, and C teams make 
the women’s ?nal. Fringe was 
less than a second off from 
sending its fourth and ?nal 
team, D, to the ?nal races. Two 
teams from Apex also made 
the ?nal. For the men’s compe-
tition, PiKA and CIA sent two 
teams along with SDC’s three 
teams.
The Robobuggy also raced, 
clocking in a 3:18.90 time, 15 
seconds faster than the previ-
ous year’s mark.
On Saturday, the competi-
tion got off to a slow start due 
to rain delays, and several ex-
hibition races were cancelled. 
The colder weather, and 
therefore, colder roads, usu-
ally leads to slower races, but 
several teams rose to the chal-
lenge to race faster than their 
preliminary times.
The ?rst race of the wom-
en’s competition was between 
SigEp A and PhiDelt A. SigEp 
A established a quick lead at 
Hill 1, which it maintained 
throughout the race. SigEp A 
won the race with a time of 
2:43.47, over a second slower 
than its preliminary time. 
PhiDelt, a relatively new or-
ganization to Buggy, saw its 
A team shave over four sec-
onds from its preliminary time 
and break the organization’s 
record.
Next came Fringe A and 
Apex C, who both dropped 
signi?cant time from their 
preliminary races. Fringe A 
won the race by a huge mar-
gin, clocking in at 2:38.06, 
three seconds faster than the 
previous day. Apex C dropped 
a huge six seconds, with the 
same pushers as the pre-
liminary race, to establish a 
new organization record at 
2:56.14.
The race between CIA A 
and Fringe C saw both teams 
perform very consistently 
with their times from Friday, 
only racing a couple tenths of 
a second faster. PiKA A went 
?ying out of the gate on Hill 
1 against Apex A, establishing 
a dominant lead. Both teams 
raced a bit slower than their 
preliminary times.
SDC A, which was disquali-
?ed in last year’s ?nals, came 
back with a vengeance, racing 
against Fringe B to break the 
record again at 2:23.27, 0.12 
seconds faster than its prelimi-
nary time. Fringe B also bested 
its time from Friday, racing 
three seconds faster.
The men’s races were also a 
showcase of SDC dominance, 
but ?rst, the organization’s B 
and C teams ran against each 
other. SDC B made some mis-
takes that led to a time over 
four seconds slower than the 
previous day’s time. SDC C 
also raced a slower time, add-
ing 0.82 seconds to its time.
In the race between SigEp 
A and CIA B were improve-
ments for both teams. The 
race of CIA A and PiKA B was 
the race of the day, the teams 
very close up until the ?fth 
and ?nal Hill. After starting 
close on Hill 1, PiKA B took 
a small lead in the freeroll. 
Coming out of the chute on 
Hill 3, the teams were side by 
side. PiKA B again took a small 
lead on Hill 4, looking to pull 
off a huge upset, but CIA A’s AJ 
Collins, pusher on Hill 5, ex-
ploded to push past PiKA B in 
the ?nal seconds, winning by 
mere feet. Both teams actually 
raced slower than the previ-
ous day. Because CIA A had to 
use the brakes on the chute to 
stay out of PiKA B’s way, they 
were granted a reroll, cutting 
off four seconds from its time 
against PiKA B.
PiKA A and Fringe A raced 
next, with PiKA A getting 
ahead with a great transition 
between Hills 1 and 2. PiKA 
A raced over a second slower 
than in the preliminary heats, 
but still moved into ?rst place. 
Fringe A raced a couple tenths 
faster than in the preliminary 
heats.
In the ?nal race of the 
day, SDC A against SPIRIT 
A, SDC A was racing against 
its own record. The transi-
tions made a big difference, 
and were the main sections 
where SDC A built on its lead. 
Racing against the dominant 
SDC A, SPIRIT A raced faster 
than on Friday, good enough 
for fourth place. SDC A raced 
around the 0.9-mile track in 
2:02.16, breaking the record 
again, by 0.16 seconds.
Each year, all the teams aim 
to best their times from years 
past, and for several teams, 
especially SDC, this year was 
no exception. Buggy, a com-
bination of design, technol-
ogy, and athleticism, is a year-
round event that is unique to 
Carnegie Mellon, a celebrated 
tradition that continues to 
thrive, year after year, draw-
ing competitors new, to join 
the races, and old, who come 
back to campus to watch each 
year.
Carnegie Mellon to host Cross Country postseason events
Hernandez suicide sparks questions about true justice

The 98th Sweepstakes saw the Student Dormitory Council (SDC) dominate both the men’s and women’s races.

The week before the NFL 
Draft is typically ?lled with ex-
citement as all 32 teams seek 
to improve their rosters while 
hundreds of young men an-
ticipate a new future by living 
their dreams and playing pro-
fessional football. Yet, the at-
tention this week was centered 
on the apparent suicide of 
former New England Patriots 
tight end Aaron Hernandez. 
The former star who was con-
victed of murder in April 2015 
was found dead in his cell on 
Wednesday morning, leaving 
behind repercussions for the 
murder victims’ families and 
bringing up questions of the 
ef?cacy of the criminal justice 
system.
The story of Hernandez 
begins with off-the-?eld 
issues during his time at the 
University of Florida. While 
his success on the ?eld helped 
the Gators win the 2009 
BCS National Championship 
Game and earned him the 
John Mackey Award given 
to the best tight end in col-
lege football, his career was 
plagued with drug problems, 
though he only ever failed 
one drug test in February 
2008. More pressing was a 
violent personality that sur-
faced in a 2007 dispute over 
not wanting to pay for two 
drinks, despite Florida quar-
terback Tim Tebow offering 
to “help resolve the con?ict” 
by paying the bill himself. 
Florida tight ends coach John 
Hevesy said that Tebow later 
attempted to help as a mentor 
but “struggled with [others’] 
immaturity.”
The Patriots still selected 
him in the fourth round of 
the 2010 NFL Draft, and it ap-
peared that his career would 
take off with quarterback Tom 
Brady alternatively passing 
to him and fellow tight end 
Rob Gronkowski. In 2012, the 
Patriots signed him to a new 
?ve year deal worth up to $40 
million, and it looked as if 
Hernandez had left his trou-
bled past behind him.
The situation quickly 
soured in June 2013 when 
Hernandez was arrested 
and charged with the mur-
der of Odin Lloyd, a semi-
professional football player 
who was dating the sister 
of Hernandez’s ?ancee. The 
prosecution offered a compel-
ling case against Hernandez, 
presenting more than 130 wit-
nesses including Patriots own-
er Robert Kraft who provided 
“crucial” testimony about 
Hernandez’s whereabouts 
during the time frame of the 
murder. With more than 400 
pieces of evidence, the defense 
was forced to concede that 
Hernandez was at the scene of 
the crime, though they main-
tained that he was merely a 
witness to the murder and 
tried to point the blame at 
co-defendants Ernest Wallace 
and Carlos Ortiz. The jury 
disagreed, rendering a guilty 
verdict for ?rst-degree murder 
after more than 35 hours of 
deliberation, and Hernandez 
was sentenced to life in prison 
without the chance of parole.
Hernandez was later tried 
for the murders of Sa?ro 
Furtado and Daniel de Abreu 
in 2012, but was found not 
guilty on Friday, April 14, 
2017. The prosecution in this 
case was “light on forensic 
evidence,” relying instead on 
the testimony of Alexander 
Bradley. The defense opted for 
an Ace Attorney-like strategy, 
pointing out a number of con-
tradictions between Bradley’s 
testimony and the evidence 
that was presented by the 
prosecution and pointing the 
blame on Bradley. The jury 
found Hernandez not guilty of 
murder, deeming him guilty of 
just one count of illegal posses-
sion of a ?rearm. Hernandez 
was emotional at this result, 
and his defense team believed 
there was hope in his appeal 
for Lloyd’s murder, saying on 
Tuesday that there was a good 
chance they could get that rul-
ing reversed.
Hernandez’s death leaves 
the families of Furtado, de 
Abreu, and Lloyd in a tenu-
ous situation when it comes 
to their civil suits against him. 
Massachusetts law includes 
a legal principle called abate-
ment ab initio. Under this prin-
ciple, someone who dies while 
pursuing appeals for their 
convictions is presumed to 
be innocent as the defendant 
would not have had all the 
chances they could to prove 
their innocence. Because 
of it, evidence established 
in the criminal case against 
Hernandez cannot be present-
ed in any civil proceedings. 
The civil case for Lloyd’s mur-
der had already ruled in favor 
of the plantiffs, with only the 
amount of damages remaining 
to be argued. It is possible that 
the ruling could change due 
to the erasure of Hernandez’s 
conviction. The Furtado and 
de Abreu families held their 
cases back, and it may make 
the process of seeking dam-
ages more dif?cult.
As in many high pro?le cas-
es, it is questionable whether 
justice was truly served or 
not. In the 2015 conviction, 
jurors were satis?ed that 
Hernandez’s high pro?le sta-
tus did not excuse his actions 
and that he received the sen-
tence he deserved. In his sepa-
rate 2017 acquittal, it could be 
argued that even a convicted 
murderer deserves to be 
found not guilty if he did not 
commit the other crime. Yet, 
questions of favoritism still 
surround that acquittal and 
the response of former team-
mates to his apparent suicide. 
“I’m gonna miss u bro, you my 
family [sic]!” tweeted former 
Florida safety Ahmad Black. 
“Despite other allegations and 
whatever else u had going, 
ill always love you bro [sic].” 
Former Florida and current 
Miami Dolphins center Mike 
Pouncey wrote on Instagram, 
“To my friend my brother! 
Through thick and thin right 
or wrong we never left each 
other’s side. Today my heart 
hurts as I got the worse news 
I could have imagined. It was 
just a day ago we shared our 
last convo [sic]. I will forever 
miss you and love you bro. 
we [sic] will meet again rest 
easy!” Critics see athletic en-
titlement intact, believing that 
teammates, coaches, fans, and 
others would protect the name 
of the team rather than honor 
the victims by seeking justice.
The only thing that is cer-
tain is that the players look-
ing forward to their careers in 
the NFL must remember that 
they are not gods who can do 
no wrong. They are, in fact, 
human beings who could lose 
everything if they commit 
destructive behavior. The tale 
of the rise and fall of Aaron 
Hernandez should serve no-
tice that their futures are not 
guaranteed against their own 
actions.

The NCAA announced 
on Tuesday that the city of 
Pittsburgh will host 11 NCAA 
Championships from 2018 to 
2022.
SportsPITTSBURGH and 
Carnegie Mellon University 
will serve as the host for 
the NCAA Division III Men’s 
and Women’s Cross Country 
Regional in 2019 and the 
NCAA Division III Men’s 
and Women’s Cross Country 
Championships in 2020. In to-
tal, Pittsburgh was awarded 22 
preliminary and ?nal rounds 
of NCAA championship events 
in Tuesday’s announcements, 
the most of any city.
“Carnegie Mellon is 
ecstatic that we were chosen 
to host these marquee NCAA 
postseason events, includ-
ing the 2020 Cross Country 
Championships,” said Director 
of Athletics Josh Centor. “It is 
a great chance to showcase 
the city of Pittsburgh, and our 
world-renowned university. 
We have hosted many NCAA 
postseason competitions 
over the past few years and 
look forward to crowning a 
national champion in this spe-
cial area of the country.”
Both events will take place 
at Cooper’s Lake Campground 
in Slippery Rock, PA, located 
north of the city. Carnegie 
Mellon University and 
SportsPITTSBURGH will host 
the NCAA Division III Men’s 
and Women’s Cross Country 
Regional on November 16, 
2019 and the NCAA Division 
III Men’s and Women’s Cross 
Country Championships on 
November 21, 2020.
This will be the ?rst 
NCAA national champion-
ship event hosted by Carnegie 
Mellon University. Carnegie 
Mellon previously hosted 
the NCAA Division III Men’s 
and Women’s Cross Country 
Regional in 2010 at the same 
course.
“We are looking for-
ward to partnering with 
SportsPITTSBURGH to give 
the student athletes and 
spectators a ?rst-class cham-
pionship meet,” said head 
cross country coach Tim 
Connelly. “The Cooper’s Lake 
Campground cross coun-
try course is a challenging, 
but very fair championship-
caliber course that has pre-
viously hosted both DII and 
DIII regional championships, 
as well as the 2008 NCAA 
Division II National Cham-
pionship. I believe that the 
runners will have a great ex-
perience here in Pittsburgh, 
and we are looking forward 
to hosting the best NCAA 
Division III runners in the 
2019 and 2020 cross country 
seasons.”
Cooper’s Lake 
Campground will also serve 
as the host for the 2018 and 
2020 NCAA Division II Men’s 
and Women’s Cross Country 
Regionals as well as the 2018 
NCAA Division II Men’s and 
Women’s Cross Country 
Championships. Each of these 
NCAA Division II events will 
be hosted by Slippery Rock 
University.

On college-aged toddlers
Dear Ruth,
I just experienced my first Carnival ever, and it 
was a blast! On a more serious note, though, 
Carnival was pretty enlightening. I realized I’m 
not really sure how to take care of drunk people.
As I navigated the various carnival activities, I 
saw my fair share of drunk people. Most of them 
were accompanied by friends who seemed to know 
exactly what to do to get their friend home safely. 
I started thinking to myself, “Do I know what to 
do if my friend needs help?” I’m worried that 
at some point someone is going to rely on me to 
make sure they’re safe and sound.
I know the basics. Make sure they drink enough 
water. Don’t let them go anywhere alone. But is 
there more I could be doing? 
Best wishes,
Somewhere Off-Beeler, Evaluating Reason?
Dear SOBER,
So you’ve (theoretically) found yourself in 
possession of a pretty drunk friend that needs 
taking care of. Congratulations, I guess. You’re 
now in charge of a toddler, but with a more 
extensive vocabulary and probably longer limbs.
Just like with toddlers, you want to make sure 
they’re properly fed and hydrated. You already 
mentioned water, and you’re right. Alcohol is 
a notorious dehydrator. You want to get them 
some food as well, though. I hope your friends 
are smart enough not to go drinking on an empty 
stomach, but just in case they aren’t (and even if 
they are), some food will go a long way towards 
making them feel better. They may not think 
they’re hungry, especially if you’ve been out for a 
while, because excess liquid usually tricks us into 
thinking we’re full, but once you get food in front 
of them they’ll probably give in.
Now, to the prospect of getting them home. We 
don’t let toddlers walk home alone, so we don’t 
let drunk friends do it either. If, again, your friends 
are smart, they will have made some kind of plan 
for getting home before you went out — but plans 
can change, so here’s your best course of action. 
Assuming it’s very late at night, an Uber or a 
Lyft is going to be super expensive, so I’d avoid 
it if you can. If your friend is still in reasonable 
control of their body, you can probably manage 
anything up to a 20 minute walk. Three’s company 
in this case; having an extra (mostly) sober person 
will make your walk a lot easier and probably a 
lot less frustrating. There’s definitely something 
to be said for having a partner in eye-rolling 
exasperation. If you can get your toddler into 
their own bed, and they seem fine — they haven’t 
passed out, they’re still responsive, they still 
remember everything — then they’re probably fine 
to leave. If they fit the above criteria, find them a 
comfy place, tell them a bedtime story, and set an 
alarm for, ideally, 3 p.m. the next day.
If at any point of the night, they pass out, start 
vomiting regularly (i.e., more than once), or are 
particularly zoned out or unresponsive, call EMS. 
If they’re underage, Amnesty exists, and even if 
for some reason it doesn’t apply, it’s still better for 
them to have an underaged drinking citation then 
to risk their health. And if they don’t agree with 
you in the morning? Well, maybe don’t go out 
with them again.
Have fun with your college-aged toddler,
Ruth

While Zeke and I crossed paths at a few Carnival-
related events, I journeyed with about six non-
Zeke people this Thursday to Pittsburgh’s premiere 
gay club, Cruze. I’ll admit a bit of bias here: 
unlike some of the other bars we’ve covered, I’ve 
been going to Cruze a few times a term since my 
freshman year. Don’t be scandalized, though - 
Thursdays are Cruze’s “College Night.” If your 
driver’s license says you’re at least 18, you could 
be in for a fun night of dancing and maybe more.
The location: On Smallman Street in the Strip 
District, Cruze is a bit of a journey from campus. 
You can either wait for a 54 or take a 61B or C 
and then transfer to the 87, 88, or 91. Commute 
time by bus is going to be 30 to 40 minutes across 
the board. Honestly, I usually just take a Lyft. 
It’s worth the extra money if you’re going with a 
mid-sized group, planning on drinking, or eager 
to avoid waiting a long time in the cold for a bus 
that may never come. After all, the buses stop at 2 
a.m. and nobody likes to cut a party short.
The drinks: Cruze is a “grab your usual and run” 
kind of bar. I paid $8 for a double whiskey and 
ginger-ale, which is pretty decent for the quality 
and level of alcohol, and my friend grabbed a 
beer for about half that. Since it’s tough to dance 
with a glass in your hand, you’ll probably chug 
rather than nurse your drink. This is not the place 
for anything fancy, because you won’t have the 
time or space to enjoy it. On the plus side, it’s a 
gay bar, so no one will bat an eye if you do order 
something fancy. At Cruze, anything goes.
The vibe: Most of what makes Cruze stand out 
from any other dance club is its connection to 
LGBTQ culture. However, Cruze has gotten less 
and less noticeably queer over the years. If 
you’re a queer girl like me, you’re likely to spend 
more time fending off creepy straight dudes than 
actually interacting with fellow queers. Cruze has 
two bars, one in a quieter lounge area by the door 
and one by the dance floor. Besides the smallish 
dance floor, the main room features a small 
stage for any exhibitionists in the crowd as well 
as couches used for resting your feet and making 
out — it’s too loud in there for anything else. If you 
actually want to talk to someone, Cruze also has 
an outdoor porch area off the dance floor that’s 
good for conversation and smoke breaks if you’re 
into that. On a good night, Cruze is a standard 
dance club, but as a queer person I do miss the 
days when it felt more like home.
Lit or Nah: On a warm “College Night” during 
Carnival? Cruze was the ideal level of lit. There 
were enough people to cover the dance floor but 
not so many that you couldn’t breathe, lost your 
friends, or had to wait forever for a bartender’s 
attention. The music was by and large top-40, but 
the (drunken) enthusiasm of the dancers was still 
contagious. As an additional bonus, I’m pretty sure 
there was an official twerk-off happening onstage. 
If you’re at or near college-age, Thursdays are 
definitely the most hopping night of the week for 
Cruze. I went on a Saturday once and it was so 
dead my friends had to hop to the straight dance 
club next door— talk about disappointing. Keep 
a look-out for their theme nights — especially of 
the “foam” and “drag” variety, which bring in 
more people and give the Cruze extra flair. My 
experiences at Cruze have varied from mediocre 
to wonderful, but the wonderful must outweigh 
the mediocre, since I keep coming back. With a 
little warm weather, alcohol, and good company 
— whether you’re an old wingman or an exciting 
stranger — you’ll have a fun night at Cruze.

Booth at Carnegie Mellon University’s Carnival is hard to miss; there is always a 
bustling energy of people interacting with the student organization’s creations. These 
ambitious projects bring together a variety of groups on campus and, through the 
frantic set up of booths, shows off their capacity for hard work and creativity. This 
year, in the spirit of the Timehop carnival, the themes for booths seemed to be all over 
the place. From Road to El Dorado by Kappa Alpha Theta to The Creation by Alpha 
Epsilon Phi to Scooby Doo: Where’s My Mummy? by Fringe, the seemingly disparate 
themes were clearly tied together by a strong sense of nostalgia.
Children were running to see the Walt Disney booth by Delta Delta Delta, and — 
similarly — going with college-aged people, it was easy to sense the nostalgia felt in 
booths like the ‘90s Cartoons booth by Alpha Phi. Wandering through booths, you 
could see the love and care these students put into the work just through the details. 
The hieroglyphics on the Scooby Doo booth were delicate, gold cutouts where the 
gang was inserted in their iconic running from monsters poses. The Hanging Gardens 
of Babylon booth by Alpha Chi Omega was a visually stunning experience, with the 
loral and fabric installations paired with the painting of the lions on the Babylonian 
Ishtar Gate. It was hard to walk through the ‘90s Cartoons and Samurai Jack booths 
without recalling childhood mornings watching cartoons while eating Cocoa Puffs, 
or some other teeth-rotting cereal of the ‘90s and early ‘00s. The sheer number of 
cartoon igures painted in the booth, and the way it placed you in each world as you 
walked through was impressive.
The KGB booth Topple the Czar and the Alpha Epsilon Phi The Creation booth are 
examples of booths that took a sense of nostalgia and history and inserted the kind 
of dry college humor. The “god’s righteous ist bump” or the game where you quite 
literally have to topple the czar with a rubber wrecking ball added a sense of play 
to the detail oriented decoration of booths. The humor was smart and well placed, a 
nice reference to the meme-oriented tendencies of the Carnegie Mellon population. 
Somewhere between the iconic “History of Japan” video and an incredibly sentimental 
history museum curated by college students, booths this year — as always — were 
delightful to see as it took me down a trip through history and memory. By the time 
this is published, booths will be gone but I look forward to next Carnival when we get 
to see the creativity and hard work of these student organizations come together with 
funnel cake and rides.

I’m happy to say that the ending to my first Spring Carnival was 
made absolutely amazing with the concert in Wiegand Gym by 
DJs NGHTMRE and San Holo. I don’t often listen to trap or house 
music, so I wasn’t sure if I was going to like it before attending. 
When I arrived at the Cohon Center, however, I was surprised to 
see so many people anxiously waiting in line to get in. It actually 
took awhile for people to be let into Wiegand because of the big 
turnout. Eventually, my friend and I made it in, and we got spots 
right in front of the stage.
I attended the last Activities Board concert in November with 
iLoveMakonnen, and it still amazes me how they’re able to trans-
form the entire gym into an extravagant concert venue. The room 
was filled with fog, even before the concert started. On the stage 
was a giant disco ball surrounded by different colored lights. Just 
by looking at the entire setup, I knew that there was a lot to look 
forward to.
Dutch DJ San Holo came out first to perform and was clearly into it 
from the very beginning. The moment he began playing tracks, he 
immediately got everyone in the crowd to start dancing. He started 
with a few remixes, including one of his most popular ones: Dr. 
Dre’s “The Next Episode.” San Holo then got into playing some 
original music. The strong beats and bass drops made everything 
seem more like a party than a concert. Lights of different colors 
flashed all throughout the room, creating this surreal effect while all 
the dancing and fist pumping were contagious. To finish his set, San 
Holo played his original and critically acclaimed song, “Light,” and 
left everyone in a feel-good mood for NGHTMRE’s performance.
When NGHTMRE began playing his songs, I noticed a difference 
between his and San Holo’s music: NGHTMRE has more of an 
intense sound, with fast beats and hard bass drops. He also played 
a combination of originally produced music and remixes of popular 
songs by Drake, Journey, and Oasis. They were some of the cool-
est mixes I’ve ever heard, and he completely transformed them 
into new beats and sounds. I could feel the ground shaking as the 
entire crowd jumped to the rhythm of all of NGHTMRE’s music. The 
coolest thing about his performances were the effects, where fire 
and fog machines were incorporated. Two times during the con-
cert, confetti fell from the ceiling and everywhere I looked people 
seemed to be having the time of their lives. People were loving 
every moment and wanted to interact with NGHTMRE as much as 
possible. My friend and I had to work hard to keep our front stage 
spots because people kept moving up as they jumped and danced.
Just watching concerts for this type of music is a lot of work in itself. 
With all the dancing, head bobbing, arm waving, and singing, you 
leave the venue pretty exhausted. But the most fascinating thing is 
that you also leave feeling rejuvenated. The whole experience is 
essentially one big dance party, with the performer projecting just 
as much energy as the audience. The music and entire environment 
left everyone with an awesome feeling, and was definitely a per-
fect ending to this year’s Carnival weekend.

When I first heard that the Scotch’n’Soda produc-
tion for Carnival would be Heathers: The Musical, 
I was wary. Having watched Heathers, the 1988 
film on which it is based, I was unsure of how such 
a dark and racy movie would translate to musi-
cal theater without becoming corny. There was no 
need to worry, however. Adjustments to the plot, 
catchy songs, raunchy humor, and, above all else, 
an extremely talented cast turned Heathers: The 
Musical into an undeniable success.
Set in suburban Westerburg High School, Heathers 
follows Veronica, the newest member of the most 
popular clique. The group is comprised of her 
and three other girls: Heather Duke, Heather 
McNamara, and the leader, Heather Chandler. 
Veronica doesn’t actually enjoy spending time 
with the Heathers, but tolerates their bratty, rude 
behavior because they make her popular. Veronica 
becomes enamored with a mysterious new kid, J.D., 
and after angering Heather Chandler at a party 
and realizing her social life is about to come to an 
end, she boldly sneaks into J.D.’s room and sleeps 
with him. The next morning, while apologizing to 
Chandler, Veronica unintentionally gives her a poi-
sonous concoction crafted by J.D. He convinces her 
to fake a suicide note, but his malicious intentions 
are revealed as he tries to kill more of their class-
mates.
The musical changes several plot points from the 
movie, and these alterations heighten the charac-
ter’s emotions and strengthen their motivations. 
One of the biggest changes is removing Betty Finn, 
Veronica’s nerdy childhood friend, and adding her 
role to Martha Dunnstock, the victim of much of 
the bullying at Westerburg High. Since Veronica is 
formerly friends with Martha Dunnstock, their rela-
tionship feels more significant than in the film, giving 
Veronica more reason to be bothered when the 
Heathers tease Martha. Martha’s later attempted 
suicide becomes a far more powerful motivator for 
Veronica to restore peace to the school, and also 
makes it a much sadder moment for the audience.
This fusion of characters also changes the relation-
ship between Heather Chandler and Veronica. In 
the movie, Veronica draws the wrath of Chandler 
for not having sex at the frat party they attend. 
However, in the musical, Veronica stops a game at 
a party that Chandler created to humiliate Martha 
in front of the rest of the school. While Chandler’s 
behavior in the film is rude and certainly not that 
of a good friend, the changes made in the musical 
make it an even more powerful breaking point for 
Veronica as she turns on her clique.
My worries about the music making the story too 
corny were immediately dispelled. The soundtrack 
expertly walks the line between funny and dark 
— but much of this can be credited to the two fabu-
lous first-year leads: economics and statistics major 
Alec Albright as J.D. and vocal performance major 
Sophia Masterson as Veronica. Masterson showed 
off her impressive range and handled Veronica’s 
ever-shifting emotions with ease. She balanced her 
character’s vulnerabilities and motivations well, 
showing Veronica’s doubts about J.D. while fall-
ing for him regardless, and her impeccable timing 
added humor to her role. She blew the audience 
away with her confident singing on “Dead Girl 
Walking” and beautifully conveyed Veronica’s 
desire for a return for normalcy as she pleaded with 
J.D. on “Seventeen.”
Albright perfectly captured the shady-but-sexy effect 
used by Christian Slater in the film. Albright used 
his expressive voice to fill his songs with feeling and 
his dynamic range to switch emotions both within 
individual songs and through the scope of the entire 
show. On “Our Love Is God,” Albright quickly alter-
nates from loving and soft to high-intensity and out-
of-control. Another standout track is “Meant to Be 
Yours,” where J.D. reaches his breaking point, and 
Albright manages to scream with anger while still 
staying melodic.
The rest of the cast impressed as well. Sophomore 
music major Daniel Brennan as Kurt and sophomore 
information systems major Walter Donnellan as 
Ram were hilarious, perfectly capturing the juvenile 
humor of the idiotic jocks with their goofy smiles 
and over-the-top fist bumps. They excelled on the 
hilariously vulgar “Blue,” where they crooned about 
their genitals while breaking out jazz hands and 
other ridiculous dance moves. Senior electrical and 
computer engineering major Don Zheng and junior 
electrical and computer engineering major Russell 
Hawkins were also strong in their roles as the jock’s 
fathers in their comedic song “My Dead Gay Son.”
Other members of the cast stood out for their dra-
matic performances. Sophomore vocal performance 
major Marina Byrne, who played the bossy Heather 
Chandler, was a commanding presence — she 
owned the stage during her scenes. The Heathers — 
Byrne, senior decision science major Alexis De La 
Rosa, and sophomore bachelor of humanities and 
arts in dramaturgy and professional writing major 
Anna Jamieson Beck — mesmerized the audience 
with their dancing and harmonizing on “Candy 
Store.” Sophomore vocal performance and creative 
writing double major Sydney Roslin, who played 
Martha Dunnstock, stunned the audience with her 
heart-wrenching performance on “Kindergarten 
Boyfriend.”
Despite a few technical hiccups, Scotch’n’Soda’s 
rendition of Heathers: The Musical was a major 
success, aided by a dark but funny script that 
preserved the character of the original film and 
was bolstered by standout vocal and acting 
performances from the entire cast.

Scotch’n’Soda’s Carnival show was full of dark humor, catchy songs, and stellar vocals

It all started four years ago, when I first set foot 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. I was a high school 
junior at the time, doing the college tour circuit. 
Carnegie Mellon wasn’t like anywhere else I had 
visited. Campus was bursting with activity. People 
were setting up tents, hammering and sawing away 
in the Morewood parking lot, blasting music by the 
fence, and generally just having a good time. It was 
energetic. It was exciting. It was, as it turned out, 
the day before Carnival.
An intrepid little high schooler, I started ask-
ing around about what was going on and what 
Carnival was, but no one had a satisfactory answer. 
There was something about booth, a thing called 
buggy, and apparently there was an annual concert 
that (sometimes) got awesome bands, but I had no 
concept of what “booth” or “buggy” were, 
how this all fit together, or why everyone 
was so darn excited for a weekend that 
seemed to be mainly about building strange con-
traptions. I left confused, but intrigued, hoping 
someday I would get a chance to attend a Carnegie 
Mellon Carnival.
Flash forward to now. I have three Carnivals under 
my belt, but when a new student asked me a week 
ago to explain Carnival, I found I couldn’t do any 
better than the people who tried to explain it to me 
all those years ago. So, hopes of giving a student’s 
eye view of the festivities and maybe painting a 
picture for future people who wonder “What is up 
with Carnival?,” here a tour of this past weekend.
Wednesday, April 19
While Carnival technically runs from Thursday to 
Saturday, any discussion of Carnival would be 
remiss without Wednesday night. There’s 
just something so special about that eve-
ning, when you finish up a short but 
undoubtedly brutal workweek and know 
you have four whole days to relax. 
Well, not necessarily relax, but at least 
spend your time however you want.
At least, it’s special in hindsight. On 
Wednesday evening I 
wasn’t feeling so optimis-
tic. When 7 p.m. rolled 
around, I was still work-
ing on a group project 
due Monday and was 
pretty much planning 
on spending the rest 
of the night on it. Then 
my phone lit up with an 
invitation to go play board 
games at a friend’s house. I 
looked at the phone. I looked 
at my pile of textbooks. I 
looked back at the phone. I 
looked back at the pile of 
textbooks. I went to play 
board games.
That’s one of the best 
things about Carnival. 
The time off from school 
gives you the flexibility to 
be spontaneous. On a given 
Saturday, I can’t just drop 
everything and go hang out 
with friends, no matter how 
much I want to or how sure 
I am that it’s going to be the 
kind of night I look back on fondly when I’m 50. But 
during Carnival, you can go make those memories. 
Thursday, April 20 
The Thursday of Carnival started bright and early 
— too early, in my opinion. While you might not 
have classes to wake you up during Carnival, if you 
live too close to Midway, you’ll have the sounds of 
booth building to do the job. Still, I can’t complain 
too much, considering they were out there in the 
pouring rain making incredible structures on a crazy 
tight deadline, while I was cuddled up in my bed 
catching up on Netflix.
Thursday is probably the chillest day of Carnival 
(if you’re not building booth). It’s a time to rest up 
from the school week and reset into Carnival mode. 
For most of us that means sleep, Netflix, sleep, 
good food, more sleep, and Midway. Unfortunately, 
this year, booths got rained out the night before 
and had to open a day late, but Midway was still in 
full swing, complete with rides and t-shirt cannons.
There are a few traditions I’ve accumulated over my 
Carnivals, and Thursday is a good day to fit them in 
while it’s the least busy. Since Carnival is scheduled 
right when Pittsburgh finally stops being a freezing 
hell-scape, I like to have a Carnival picnic. Though, 
it’s more a bunch of people hanging out outside 
than a picnic, since nobody ever has time to make 
food. Another tradition is baking. This year’s cakes 
were Mimosa (orange cake with champagne icing) 
and fireball (classic Carnival). The third and most 
important tradition is funnel cake. To be honest, fun-
nel cake is my all-time favorite thing about Carnival. 
I’m very food focused. Don’t judge me.
Friday, April 21
Friday was when Carnival got serious. Between 
buggy races in the morning, the comedy show in 
the afternoon, and booths opening after the rain 
delay, there was plenty to do.
Buggy and booth were two of the most confusing 
aspects of Carnival to me when I first heard about 
it. When you ask a typical Carnegie Mellon stu-
dent what Carnival is, they’ll almost definitely talk 
about buggy and booth before anything else. What 
always confused me was how these two seemingly 
unrelated events could combine to form the heart 
of Carnival. Listening to someone describe booth 
or buggy they can just sound like quirky traditions 
that you could take or leave. But there’s something 
about them that makes you excited to get up in the 
So, What is Carnival?

morning to go watch buggy — even if you didn’t get 
home till 5 a.m. the night before — and pushes you 
to brave the swarms of people on Midway to get a 
look at all the booths.
I think it’s the level of dedication that the people 
involved put into their product. After watching your 
roommate stumble to push practice at ungodly 
hours all semester, of course you’re going to go 
cheer them on at the final race, so loudly it’s almost 
embarrassing — and maybe take them out for ice 
cream after like a proud dad. I think that’s why 
booth and buggy are at the center of our four-day 
Carnegie Mellon extravaganza. The passion, drive, 
and dedication I found on campus were why I 
decided to come to Carnegie Mellon. I love being 
in a place where everyone is so excited about what 
they’re doing that it makes me excited. It’s the same 
passion and dedication that are on full display 
during Carnival.   
Saturday, April 22
Ah, Saturday, the grand finale. I’m 
always kind of impressed that people 
still have so much energy come 
Saturday, but somehow it manages 
to be the busiest day yet. Things start 
early with the buggy finals, then 
Holi, then, at least for me, the 
Scotch’n’Soda show, and finally 
the concert.
I’m going to be honest, I’ve 
gotten old. Like, I 
go to bed before 
midnight and 
hobble around 
in the morning 
because my back 
hurts, and I am 
basically grandma 
levels of old. So, 
by the time Saturday 
rolled around, the whole 
weekend was start-
ing to catch up 
with me. Holi is 
pretty much every-
thing I love about 
Carnival, being spon-
taneous and making 
memories with friends 
without worrying about 
the future or consequenc-
es, in this case all the 
places you’re going 
to accidently track 
color and how 
you’re going to 
make it into your 
room without smearing the whole door 
in powder. I have always wanted to 
go, but, unfortunately, this year my 
grandma nature struck again and I 
didn’t make it out to event. Ah well, 
better luck next year. 
At least it meant I was colored-powder-
free when I headed to the S’n’S show.
The S’n’S show is always one of my 
favorite parts of Carnival, and this 
year they preformed one of my favor-
ite musicals, Heathers: The Musical. 
I usually prefer the late show during 
Carnival because the crowd always 
has a great energy and gets really 
into the show, but this year 
I decided to give the 
matinee a try. While 
there wasn’t as 
much laughter 
and heckling as 
the late show, the less rowdy crowd allowed me 
to focus on the show more and brought out some 
emotional moments that might have gone unnoticed 
amidst the laughs.
The show was the last structured Carnival event 
I went to, but by no means does that mean my 
Carnival ended at 5 p.m. I spent the rest of the day 
wandering around with friends, exploring campus 
and the greater Pittsburgh area. This was honestly 
my actual favorite part of Carnival, though funnel 
cake was a close second. Carnival is the time of 
year when you can go on small, silly adventures 
with your friends. The school provides activities by 
way of all the shows and buggy and booth that 
can be made into adventures, or you can make 
your own way with your friends. I think that’s why 
explaining Carnival to people who haven’t been is 
so difficult. What on paper looks like an exhaustive, 
random list of unrelated events is really the frame-
work for an amazing, spontaneous choose-your-
own-adventure with your friends.

The Activities Board’s (AB) 1st Annual Comedy 
Showcase, held on Friday, April 21 from 1:30 
p.m. to 6:30 p.m., was a different spin on 
Carnival’s usual comedy act. While the talent 
involved seemed to be great, the event was 
awkwardly held and placed, making for an 
odd experience.
For this year’s Carnival, instead of putting on 
one comedy show, the AB held the 1st Annual 
Comedy Showcase outside at the Tennis Court 
Amphitheater. Instead of having one performer, 
AB brought six performers to the showcase. 
Debra Digiovanni, Jordan Rock, Brandon 
Wardell, Andrew Michaan, Brendon Walsh, and 
Brent Weinbach all performed one after the 
other, bringing their own style of comedy to the 
event. However, the venue made it difficult for 
thier styles to shine. 
In addition, halfway through the event there was 
a 45-minute intermission with music from a DJ, 
who ended up sounding and looking like a living 
meme in his green track suit. He also happened to 
match with the members of AB running the event, 
who were clad in black and blue tracksuit sets. To 
further emphasize his meme status, he ended up 
playing and mixing songs such as the Four Non-
Blondes song “What’s Up,” popularized by the 
infamous He-Man YouTube video, making every-
one cringe.
In earnest, the comedians tried to make do with 
what they had. Their usual scenery, a small 
evening night club with seats close to the stage, 
sharply contrasted the huge sprawling green 
grass area with the first row of seats several feet 
away from the stage. For the most part, the scen-
ery removed the interpersonal element of comedy 
that is usually integral in a stand-up performance. 
Andrew Michaan handled this the best, incorpo-
rating in audience interaction and fitting his vibe 
and energy with the crowd to make it a bit more 
lax, thus generating a bit more energy within 
the crowd.
The timing of the event also felt odd. The event 
encouraged people to come and go as they 
pleased or to stay for the entire set. I wasn’t even 
sure how long to stay at the set because of the 
event’s lax nature. For most people, the huge 
lawn outside the Tennis Court Amphitheater was a 
place for people to relax, and the set sometimes 
served more as background noise than a perfor-
mance, so members of the audience came and 
went as they desired. In fact, the set really did 
serve as background noise if you were out buying 
cotton candy or fries, contributing to the event’s 
odd nature.
While I was only able to see three acts, I could 
tell that the set up was a struggle for all the 
performers in different ways. Featured on MTV, 
Comedy Central, and known for popularizing 
the phrase “D***s out for Harambe,” Brandon 
Wardell, to quote Comics Editor Julie Sanscartier, 
“had a panic attack on stage,” and only per-
formed for around 15 to 30 minutes of his 45 
minute set. A great thing that Wardell did was 
that he made use of the massive space between 
him and the audience, stepping out into the grass 
to interact with people. It made the set feel a little 
more personal despite Wardell’s realizing he had 
to censor his jokes around children in the audi-
ence. He ended up mixing in an “aux set” with 
some jokes before walking up to the AB event 
organizers and begging them down on his knees 
to “never do this again.”
The worst part of Wardell’s set, however, was 
probably that his remaining time was given to 
Brendon Walsh, whose set was comprised of a 
lot of penis jokes and childish and relationship 
humor. It made me feel a little uncomfortable, and 
while I was glad that Walsh could fill out the time 
better than Wardell did, he wouldn’t have been 
my first choice to follow Wardell with.
One of my friends commented before I headed 
out to the showcase that seeing five hours of com-
edy would eventually be tiring. While I was only 
able to attend three of those hours, I definitely 
began to agree with her. While the talent involved 
in the Comedy Showcase seemed to have huge 
potential, the situation was not ideal for them to 
show off their talents and the frustration and heat 
contributed to a tired vibe from the audience. If 
the event had been condensed to three comedians 
and held in the evening instead, I think the event 
would have had a much better turnout and recep-
tion and could have let people enjoy the rest of 
Carnival’s daytime events.

Holi, the Indian festival of colors, took place 
this Saturday, April 22, from noon to 3 p.m. 
on the Mall. Students gathered from around 
campus dressed in pre-ordered white shirts, 
to throw color, eat great food, and dance 
together on a frigid afternoon. 
While it was chilly, the energy of the par-
ticipants brought a sense of warmth and 
familiarity to the mall, where laughter and 
playful shrieks could be heard from as far 
as Midway. 
The theme this year was 24-Kolor Magic, 
tipping a hat to Bruno Mars’ hit song from 
last year. The collective event, packed with 
plenty of play, performances from South 
Asian groups around campus, and a sense of 
togetherness, definitely lived up to its name   
— being nothing short of magical.
