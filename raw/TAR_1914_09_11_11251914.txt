FOOTBALL MEN HOLD BAN­
QUET AT HOTEL SCHENLEY.
After Saturday’s game with Alle­
gheny the football men held their an­
nual banquet at the Hotel Schenley. 
About twenty-five of the squad, be­
side Coach Steffen, Manager Rownd, 
Doctor Marks, Director Hamerschlag 
and Mr. Culloch were present. After 
partaking of a choice selection of ed­
ibles, the varsity men gathered to­
gether to elect a captain, and “Curly” 
Lauer, Tech’s sturdy left end was 
selected by a unanimous vote to lead 
the 1915 team. Lauer is a Junior in 
the Civil Engineering course and has 
played on the team for two years. 
He is a favorite among the players 
and his selection was a popular one. 
Lauer has the personality and abil­
ity to make an able leader. In re­
sponse to a call for a speech, Lauer 
fully assured all those present that he 
would leave nothing undone to make 
the 1915 team the best ever.

Short speeches were then made by 
Coach Steffen, Director Hamerschlag, 
Dr. Marks, Captain McCaughey, Mr. 
McCulloch, Rownd, Balsinger, Welch, 
Kreider, Levy, Henning, Captain
Benny of the Scrubs, Munhall, Kes-

ing idea in all the talks was that
things are beginning to come our way 
and that it is up to all those con­
nected with Tech to keep the ball
rolling. We can help to bring this 
about by ericouraging new men to en­
ter school and by giving support and 
aid to the old men remaining here. 
Above all, we expect to play with a

Carnegie closed her football season 
last Saturday when she suffered a de­
feat at the hands of Allegheny Col­
lege, the Meadeville aggregation win­
ning by the score of 26 to 7. The 
game was hard fought throughout, 
but Allegheny was too strong for her 
opponents and outweighed them. Had 
Carnegie won, the season would have 
ended with five victories and three de­
feats, but, as it is now, the numbers 
are even.
The Plaid team was not on the fine 
edge that they were a week ago last 
Saturday, and had they displayed the 
same plucky, fast and aggressive game 
which they played against Pitt, the 
score might have been different.
Allegheny’s backfield was one of 
the heaviest which has faced Carnegie 
this season and had little trouble in 
breaking through the Tech line. In 
fact, Munhall, Cox, Arnold, and Bash 
played together as one unit and pre­
sented one of the most formidable set 
of ground gainers which have ap­
peared against Carnegie. The Plaid 
line was weakened by the absence of 
Capt. MacCaughey and Crawford, 
while Balsinger was missing from 
the backfield.
Allegheny was especially adequate 
at the forward pass and handled the 
ball with greatest skill. All of their 
passes were for gains of considerable 
distance, two of them being for thirty 
yards or more. The Plaid eleven was 
not very successful at this form of at­
tack, but used a lateral pass play a 
couple of times which netted them 
several yards.
Allegheny’s chief star turned out to 
be Munhall, a line bucker of no little 
ability, and a man who was able to 
pick holes through which to gain. He 
was a very hard man to tackle and in 
addition, an excellent kicker. Arnold 
likewise played a crack game and 
handled the forward pass excellently. 
Cox played well at quarter. Alle­
gheny’s line was a tower of strength 
and held stubbornly on the defense. 
On the offense they succeeded in open­
ing good holes for their backs. Tech’s 
line did some clever holding when 
they caused Allegheny to make three 
or four attempts in order to shove the 
ball over the line from the three- 
yard mark. Marshall at left half played 
the best game for the Plaid and 
seemed able to gain the most ground 
for them. “Sunny” Kesner, it is need­
less to say, excelled in his general­
ship and ability to tackle. Oeffinger 
at fullback did all of Carnegie’s kick­
(ROSS-COUNTRY

ing-off. In the line the two ends, 
Lauer and Levy, covered punts well 
and the latter made a pretty tackle, 
when he nailed Arnold who had just 
received a punt on one occasion on 
Carnegie’s 35-yard line. Hellstrom 
filled his position capably and suc­
ceeded in breaking through x\lle- 
gheny’s line and blocking a kick by 
Cox.
Although the weather was very cold 
there were not so many fumbles as 
one might have expected. The field, 
however, was in a frozen condition 
and mean to play on. In spite of the 
cold a large crowd turned out to wit­
ness the contest.
First Period.
Oeffinger kicked off to Bash on the 
10-yard line and the ball was 
returned to the 30-yard mark. 
Arnold made five yards and 
Munhall eight, for first down. Bash 
failed to gain. Munhall made three 
and five. Munhall fumbled and Baker 
recovered for Allegheny, but Tech se­
cured the ball on downs. Kesner 
made four yards. Marshall fumbled 
and Kreider recovered. Kreider fum­
bled and Munhall recovered for Alle­
gheny on his own 40-yard line. Bash 
and Munhall gained three each. Mun­
hall failed to gain. Kramer punted 
to Kesner, who returned from the 15 
to the 20-yard line. Kreider failed 
to gain. Kreider fumbled and Alle­
gheny recovered. Arnold hit the line 
for two yards. A forward pass, Cox 
to Pierson, was incomplete. Bash 
booted a field goal from the 23-yard 
line for the first score of the game. 
Score: Allegheny 3, Tech 0.
Munhall caught Oeffinger’s kickoff 
on the 16-yard line and returned to 
the 27. Arnold made three yards at 
end. Allegheny was penalized five 
yards for offside. Bash made five 
yards and Kramer punted to Kesner 
on the five-yard line. Kesner returned 
the ball 10 yards. Kesner failed in the 
line. Kesner punted to Allegheny’s
49-yard line. Arnold made no gain. 
Cox carried the ball and went out 
of bounds on Tech’s 40. Bash was 
good for two yards. Cox’s forward 
pass was incomplete. Cox made an­
other incomplete forward pass. Cox 
punted to Kesner on the two-yard 
line and Kesner ran back three yards. 
Kesner punted to Arnold on the 35- 
yard line, where Levy made a beauti­
ful tackle. Arnold made two in the 
line. Cox’s pass was incomplete again.

P. A. A., PITT, STATE AND TECH 
ENTERED.
The third annual cross-country race 
held by the Crafton Athletic Associa­
tion will be staged tomorrow morn­
ing at Crafton over a six-mile course. 
Last year Carnegie won the team 
trophy with Captain Haselton, Mac­
Millan, Campbell, and Handelman 
forming the winning quartet. But 
this season the last named runner is 
the only member of the old team who 
will compete for Tech. He will be 
accompanied by Walker, Rieser, and 
Moore, in all likelihood, when the 
places for scoring are considered; 
while a second team will be picked 
from Bayard, Benter, DeYoung, Carey 
and Slater. Dunseith ran on his 
“nerve” in the P. A. A. meet ten days 
ago, and injured it to such an extent 
that he will be unable to take part in 
tomorrow’s race. His leg, however, is 
improving rapidly and should be 
working overtime next spring.
Tech will be pitted against P. A. A., 
Pitt, Penn State and a number of 
prominent unattached runners. Or­
gan, the winner of the P. A. A. race, 
is the favorite but Waite of P. A. A. 
and Humble of State should follow 
him closely. The latter is a former 
Tech man who is more than making 
good, having recently won the cross­
country race for his school in dual 
competition with the University of 
Pennsylvania.
The run tomorrow' morning will 
start promptly at 10 o’clock from the 
Crafton Oval and will finish at the 
same place.
BOARD OF CONTROL MEETS.
The Board of Control held its sec­
ond monthly meeting on Nov. 18th. 
Several matters of importance were 
passed upon. Overdorf, of the Ap­
plied Industries School, was elected 
track manager for the coming season. 
He was second assistant last year and 
has been taking care of the cross­
country men this fall; he has shown 
himself to be a hard worker and 
should make a good manager.
The matter of a football coach was 
taken up and Mr. Steffen was re­
engaged and offered a contract for 
the coming year. Little need be said 
about this, as everyone knows the 
schools’ attitude toward the coach. 
Success is reassured if Steffen comes 
back to Tech.

CONGRATULATIONS
TO CARNEGIE.
The Tartan extends to Andrew Car­
negie its heartiest congratulations on 
this, his seventy-ninth birthday. His 
recent visit here, brings him all the 
closer to us and we hope we may be 
permitted the pleasure of an annual 
meeting with our founder until at 
least, to name some definite limit, the 
digits representing his present age 
may be reversed.
POOR RESPONSE
FROM PLEBES.
A request was made last Friday 
afternoon in the Design School The­
ater before the performance of the 
plays, that the Plebes report on the 
football field the following morning to 
remove the snow from the gridiron. 
But the plea was practically unheeded, 
and had it not been for the telephone, 
by means of which a number of men 
wrere reached at the fraternity houses, 
the snow might still be on the field. 
Considering the fair treatment the 
Plebes have been accorded this year, 
their attitude is rather discouraging 
and unlooked for. If the class 
of 1918 is possessed of an in­
different feeling toward its school 
and is unwilling to make some slight 
sacrifice for it, the welfare of Car­
negie four years hence should be a 
matter of grave concern to the pres­
ent upper classes.
CRITICISM OF THE BOARD OF 
CONTROL.
We are always loath to criticize the 
Board of Control for we believe its 
members have the best interests of 
the school at heart. Yet its recent 
actions have caused such unfavorable 
comment among the students, that 
we deem it justifiable to state some
of the objections as well as the sug­
gestions for improvement, we have 
heard. The actions referred to are, 
first, the adoption of gray as the 
standard color of sweater to be worn 
by all Varsity teams comprising the 
major sports of football, baseball and 
track, and second, the election of a 
Night School student as first assistant 
track manager.
What in our opinion, constitutes the 
most valid objection to the results of 
the last Board of Control meeting is 
the rapid manner in which those de­
cisions were arrived at. Both of the 
disputed issues are important enough 
to claim the interest of the entire stu­
dent body, but no mention of either 
of them was made before the meeting, 
although we are informed the Board 
of Control is a committee representa­
tive of the students.
Two years ago, the Board of Con­
trol then in existence, changed the 
color of the football sweater from 
white to maroon, hoping that for the 
future, the scheme of Varsity insignia 
for major sports might remain fixed. 
Now the Board of 1914, unfortunately 
not of the same opinion as that of 
1912, makes an effort to standardize 
the Varsity awards for major athletics 
by decreeing that gray sweaters shall 
be worn by all teams. What are we 
going to do, we meekly ask, if for­
sooth, the Board of Control of 1916 
shall have still different ideas regard­
ing the colors of the sweaters? The 
football team, which as well as any 
other team affected by the new ruling, 
deserves the privilege of expressing 
its opinion on the proposed change if 
it cares to do so, heartily supports the 
old system and disproves the new 
play, basing its arguments on 
the grounds that each sport should be 
kept distinctive, that the former meth­
od proved satisfactory, and that the 
public was just beginning to recognize 
the significance of the maroon, the 
blue, and the gray sweaters.
In criticising the election of a Night 
School man as first assistant track 
manager, we want to state clearly 
that no opposition to the chosen of­
ficer personally is intended. Showing 
preference to a Night student over a 
Day student seems to be establishing 
a doubtful precedent, not because the 
Night students are unworthy of that 
preference, but because, on an aver­
age, they have not the time to devote 
to their duties that the Day men have. 
Admitting, as we are told, that the 
manager just elected, is fortunately 
enough situated to be able to carry on 
his track work satisfactorily, what in­
ducement will there be to candidates 
to compete for the position of second 
assistant manager, which requires the 
hardest and least desirable labor on 
the part of the incumbent? It is not 
likely that Night students will offer 
their services as second assistants be­
cause of lack of time and it is hardly 
fair to invite Day students to contest 
for an office with no definite chance 
for promotion after a year of service.
Both of the discussed motions 
adopted by the Board of Control, 
should, we believe, be reconsidered be­
cause of the conspicuous dissatisfac­
tion they have caused. But before 
another vote is taken, we urge that
the students be formally or informally 
consulted in order to make the next 
decision more representative of the 
student will.
FROM A FORMER CHEER 
LEADER.
We are in receipt of a letter from R. 
K. Merrill, ’08, a former cheer leader 
and brother of our present leader. 
Merrill was greatly impressed with 
the accounts of the Pitt-Tech game 
and his enthusiasm is shown in his 
writing. We are glad to print most 
of his letter, but for diplomatic rea­
sons two statements concerning our 
rivals have been omitted:
Grand Rapids, Mich., 
Nov. 18, 1914.
Editor of The Tartan.
Dear Sir:—I have just finished 
reading two of last Sunday’s papers 
with accounts of Tech’s wonderful 
showing against the much vaunted 
Pitt team on Saturday last. To one 
who has not seen a football game ex­
cept, between High School teams, for 
years, the reporters’ description of 
the game was exciting and I can im­
agine the feelings of the team, student 
body, and friends when that attempt 
at a field goal went wrong. It is a 
matter of common knowledge even 
in this city that Pitt has a good team.
. . . Your coach is evidently a man 
of action and Tech should make every 
effort to retain him for another year.
After all is said, brains will win 
over almost any obstacle even against 
brawn in the football game, and that’s 
what counts. Tech men should re­
member that they will have many a 
battle in the business world where 
their brains will win, and weight and 
strength will count for nothing and 
they may even go up against these 
same men who were our opponents 
on Saturday.
For fear that I should be taken for 
a sermonizer, let me say here that 
while a student at Tech I was one of 
the craziest cheer leaders that ever 
exhausted himself to draw forth vol­
umes of sound from a bunch of 
leather-lunged associates.
So play the game, play it fair, use 
your brains and you will win. We will 
beat Pitt some time. . .
Very truly yours,
Ralph K. Merrill, 1908.

CORRECTION OF A FALSE 
REPORT.
Philadelphia, 11-20-14. 
Professor A. A. Hamershlag,
Carnegie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Dear Professor Hamerschlag:
For his colleagues at the University 
of Pennsylvania, I am writing to 
thank the friends of Paul Cret for the 
messages of condolence and appre­
ciation sent by them following the re­
port of his death. We are deeply 
gratified at this proof of the admira­
tion and affection which his talents 
and personal qualities have everywhere 
won for him.
Happily the report was false. Upon 
its appearance in the papers of No­
vember 10th, I began an inquiry which 
eventually traced it through several 
stages to a remark made by a New 
York Architect, based upon his un­
derstanding of a newspaper report 
of about October 15th. Philadelphia 
friends of Professor and Mme. Cret 
have received several letters from 
them written since that time, the latest 
dated on November 5th, showing that 
he was still at Lyons, engaged in local 
military service as a guard of com­
munications and expecting call to his 
battalion headquarters at Grenoble, 
there to undergo training for active 
service at the front.
Again with appreciation of your kind 
thought, I am,
Very sincerely yours,
WARREN P. LAIRD.

BASKETBALL.
Thursday afternoon, the Juniors 
played the Plebes and beat them by 
the score of 25 to 15. Owing to lack of 
practice on both sides the game was 
not as fast as it otherwise might have 
been. Although the Juniors have up 
to this time lost but one game in their 
basketball career, it behooves them to 
work hard to maintain their record. 
Most of the honors of Thursday go 
to the forwards of both teams, who did 
excellent work. Miss Lewis seems 
to contain good possibilities, and in 
the coming games with more prac­
tice great things will be expected. So, 
it is strongly urged that the class of­
ficers organize their teams and put 
them through some stiff practice, that 
the remaining games will go off with 
a snap and vigor which will make 
watching them a delight. Also, if the 
girls of the school would take a little 
interest and go to the games occa­
sionally, the players would feel more 
like doing their very best. The con­
test for championship this year will 
be a close one and school spirit should 
reign supreme.
The line-up for Thursday was as 
follows:
JUNIORS. PLEBES.

A NOTE ON FOOT-AND-MOUTH 
DISEASE.
Vermont is the fifteenth state to de­
clare a quarantine on cattle because 
of foot - and - mouth disease which 
threatens to spread over the entire 
country. With the growing interest 
in this disease, because of the present 
epidemic in this country, it will not 
be out of place, perhaps, to review 
our knowledge on this subject. Syn­
onyms for foot-and-mouth disease are 
aphthous fever, epizootic catarrh and 
eczema contagiosa.
The virus, causing this disease, 
similar to the one producing rabies, is 
so small that we cannot see it even 
with the aid of the highest powers of 
the microscope and it can pass through 
the pores of the finest filters. This 
disease is of peculiar interest, histor­
ically, because it was the first one in 
which an altramiscropic virus was 
demonstrated. This was accomplished 
in 1898 by Loeffler and Froesch. The 
virus is readily destroyed by disin­
fectants and, as in rabies, can be pre­
served by the use of glycerine. The 
danger of the spread of foot-and- 
mouth disease through the agency of 
milk, is eliminated by subjecting the 
milk to a temperature of 60 degrees C. 
for twenty minutes and for this rea­
son the Director of Student Health
has wisely ordered that all the milk 
served at the commons be thus pas­
teurized.
This disease, acute and highly com­
municable, is nearly always confined 
to cloven-foot animals, although occa­
sionally horses, dogs and cats are af­
fected. It is characterized by an erup­
tion of vesicles on the mucous mem­
brane of the mouth and the skin be­
tween the toes, which vesicles rupture 
forming erosions and ulcers. Other 
symptoms are salivation, tenderness 
of the affected parts, lameness, loss of 
appetite, emaciation and dimunition 
in the quantity of milk secreted. While 
the mortality in the lower animals is 
only about one per cent the economic 
loss is very great, because of the small 
amount of milk secreted and the ac­
tual loss in the body weight of the 
animal, which condition very frequent­
ly persists after recovery. The milk 
of infected animals becomes thin, blu­
ish in color, poor in fat, milk, sugar 
and casein and after the third day of 
the disease may contain inflammatory 
products. If the udder happens to be 
involved, the milk becomes slimy and 
yellowish and often contains coagu­
lated fibrin and blood in the later 
stages may even have a disagreeable 
odor and repulsive taste. The period 
of incubation of the disease in the 
lower animals is generally two to six 
days, but it may be prolonged to fif­
teen or eighteen days, and so far as 
we know one attack does not confer 
any immunity against future attacks.
While this is primarily a disease of 
the lower animals it is sometimes 
transmitted to man. Persons in charge 
of diseased animals may become in­
fected during the processes of milking 
and slaughtering but it is generally 
contracted through the ingestion of 
unboiled milk. Usually the disease in 
man simulates that in cattle, although 
it is generally very mild and death 
seldom results except in weakened 
children and then perhaps because of 
secondary complications. Fever, vom­
iting, pain in swallowing, heat and 
dryness of mouth, with an eruption 
of vesicles, about the size of a pea, 
on the lips, gums, cheeks, and edge 
of the tongue, characterize the dis­
ease. Though the disease is contract­
ed chiefly through the ingestion of 
raw milk, it may, possibly, be con­
veyed by any of the dairy products 
made from the milk of infected ani­
mals and it is quite probable that the 
disease may be contracted if the virus 
gains access directly to the blood 
stream of man, through wounds of 
various kinds.
In this connection it is interesting 
to recall the work of Mohler and Ros- 
enau (Circular 147, Bureau of Animal 
Industry, Department of Agriculture, 
1909), who found that animals inocu­
lated with the viruses of foot-and- 
mouth disease and vaccinia (cowpox) 
showed only symptoms of the latter 
disease, although the virus of the for­
mer was contained in the vesicles due 
to cow pox. This shows a remarkable 
symbiosis between the viruses of the 
two diseases and although the virus 
of foot-and-mouth disease, has actu­
ally been demonstrated in one in­
stance, as a contaminating agent in 
vaccine virus, there is no record of
foot-and-mouth disease having thus 
been transmitted to man, probably be­
cause it is not conveyed by cutaneous 
inoculation.
One of the most interesting out­
breaks, in which the disease was trans­
mitted to man, is that recorded by 
Robinson at Dover in February, 1884. 
It was definitely traced to foot-and- 
mouth disease in cattle which had oc­
curred on a farm in January of that 
year and was conveyed through the 
agency of milk. In all, two hundred 
and five persons were affected, the 
symptoms being local inflammation 
of the throat with enlargement of the 
lymph glands of the neck and in some 
cases vesicular eruptions. Erysipelas 
was also met with and four of the 
cases were fatal. Though the disease 
prevails to a wide extent in many 
parts of Europe and Asia there have 
been only five previous epidemics re­
corded in the United States. These 
occurred in 1870, 1880, 1884, 1902-’03 
and 1908, but because of the drastic 
measures instituted by the various 
health organizations the disease was 
quickly controlled.
The preventive measures instituted 
to control the spread of the disease 
among cattle are: First, strict quar­
antine; second, isolation of suspect­
ed animals; third, destruction and 
proper burial of infected animals; and 
fourth, complete disinfection of the 
premises on which the outbreak has 
occurred. To prevent the spread of 
the disease from animal to man the 
following precautions are taken': First, 
proper care in handling suspected and 
infected animals; second, care in se­
lecting milk from healthy animals; 
and third, pasteurization (“holder” 
process) of milk when disease is preva­
lent.

with a team that will meet all scholas­

was prevalent in the minds of most 
of the speakers was a desire to beat 
Pitt in the near future. After our 
splendid showing this year, this feat 
has been judged as not impossible. 
Furthermore, Coach Steffen assured 
all those present that he intends to 
come back to Tech next year. He 
expressed his appreciation for the fine 
treatment accorded him during his 
stay in Pittsburgh and he feels that 
with a repetition of the spirit shown 
this year, Tech will have a real win­
ner next year.

helped to give the party a send off

Young Steffen arose to the occasion

FEDERATED YOUNG MEN’S 
CLUBS VISIT OUR 
SCHOOL.
INDUSTRIES INVITATION 
DANCE A SPLENDID 
SUCCESS.
TEACHERS’ CLASS NOTES.
The Teachers’ Class paid a visit to 
the “Home of the 57” on Wednesday- 
last. The party was conducted by Dr. 
Libby. All enjoyed the visit very 
much and suggest that other groups 
in the school organize and make the 
trip through Heinz’s great plant.
The constitution for the Industrial 
Teachers’ Literary Society has been 
framed for adoption. The election of 
officers for the Society will take place 
in the near future.
Last Friday evening will long ling­
er in the minds of those who were 
guests at the Industries dance tend­
ered the Freshmen and Faculty of the 
Industries School by the combined 
Upper, Teachers and Middle classes. 
As a social function it well ranked 
with any similar affair ever held in 
the school.
Promptly at eight, Nirella’s Or­
chestra launched forth one of the 
season’s latest productions and im­
mediately livened up the dancers to 
a high pitch, and the spacious hall 
on top of the Central Building be­
came a vortex of the “danse clas- 
sique.” The colored lights, procured 
especially for the occasion added a 
pro-Thanksgiving air to the affair, and 
the display of banners, pennants and 
festoons transformed the Tech danc­
ing academy into a most comfortable 
spot for the many dances. The Fac­
ulty were well represented and their 
dancing drew plaudits of no mean 
calibre. The Director, Dean Connel­
ly, heads of departments, instructors, 
students,—all seemed to enjoy the 
terpsichorean revelry to their fullest 
capacity. Between dances, the re­
freshment committee headed by Ad­
olph Schütz, served a splendid lunch 
while in the restaurant below Miss 
Lucas and her assistants offered cof­
fee, tea and cakes to those who found 
pleasure in singing Tech songs and 
playing the club room piano. During 
the course of the evening, school tal­
ent came to the fore and the applause 
given the Industries quartette for its 
splendid rendition of school songs 
served well to show the appreciation 
of its efforts. “Tommy” Malley sang 
several of his rag-songs and his style 
needs no elaboration. The inimitable 
“Sox” Price brought down the “house” 
with his monologue, whistling and 
songs and left one of the audience 
wondering where certain cucumbers 
were to be found for the future.
The hours went all too quickly and 
in the early morning one of the finest 
successes of the Industries school 
came to a close. Too much thanks 
cannot be extended Messrs. Liggett, 
Parsons, Orr, Kavanaugh, for their 
work on the committee.
Numbering a hundred and more, 
the Federated Young Men’s Clubs 
of the Pittsburgh district visited the 
Industries Building a week ago yester­
day as a guest of the school. Assem­
bly Room 104 was thrown open to the 
visitors and following an introductory 
welcome by Dean Connelly and an 
address by Mr. Hartman, his assistant, 
a piano recital by Plebe Hoxworth 
was next in order and his accomplish­
ments drew repeated encores. Ralph 
Meiken and S. J. McNulty, with their 
splendid singing, found their way to 
the hearts of the young men present 
and were called upon for several of 
their winning songs. Parker and his 
1 iger tat. drew iorth rounds of laugh­
ter and applause.
Following a generous program, pic­
tures depicting students at work in the 
various schools were thrown upon the 
screen after which a general discus­
sion and a trip through the building 
was made.
INTER-SECTIONAL BASKET­
BALL.
A team picked from the Middle 
class traveled out to Hazelwood to 
play St. Stevens Lyceum last Satur­
day and after an unusually rough 
game were defeated by the score of 
about 37 to 6.

Schwerin, a Night Science man, 
was elected first assistant track man­
ager. Little is known about him as 
he has not yet done any work con­
nected with the track team.
In an effort to make a uniform Var­
sity reward for competition, a 
motion was passed wherein it 
was decided that all the ma­
jor sports should receive a gray 
coat sweater. This puts the football 
baseball and track men on the same 
level because they will all wear the 
same kind of a sweater and the same 
size letter.

club expects to be in touch with other 
Southern clubs about the city which 
will be of great advantage to its mem­

President Crump then gave a short 
talk upon the future of the club and 
its object. Short talks by the other 
officers followed, after which the 
meeting adjourned.
The next meeting is to be held in 
the Design School on Tuesday, No­

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
DRAMA STUDENTS ENTERTAIN 
UNDERCLASSMEN.
A special matinee for the Sopho­
mores and Plebes of the Science and 
Industry schools was held in the De­
sign Theater on Friday afternoon, 
November 20, at four o’clock. On 
this occasion the Plebes of the Drama 
Course gave their first performance, 
“The Land of Heart’s Desire”, and 
gave it well. The second part of the 
performance was the rendering o£ 
the Irish play, “The King’s Thresh­
old”, one of the plays given several 
times before.
The reason for limiting tickets to 
the two lower classmen was that the 
Director wished to make up for the 
special performances given to the 
Seniors while Mr. Carnegie was here 
not long ago. At the performance 
given for the entire student body on 
Saturday evening, November 8th, the 
attendance of Plebes and Sophomores 
was small and for this reason also the 
attendance was confined to these 
classes.
It is not probable that these plays 
will be repeated.
TECH STUDIO CLUB.
The Tech Studio Club recently held 
a meeting and elected officers for the 
coming year. The election resulted 
as follows:
President, A. Brady McSwigan.
Vice President, Nathan Dunn.
Secretary, Chas. M. Kirk.
Treasurer, H. W. Ludwig.
Publicity Secretary, Geo. Long.
Marshal, Otto Allen.
The club has planned to have sev­
eral social functions during the year 
as well as scheduling a series of lec­
tures.
Two candidates have been admitted 
to the club and initiations were held 
last Thursday.
DESIGN SCHOOL FUND.
At a meeting of the Design School 
last Wednesday a Design Activity 
Fund was formulated. The purpose 
of the fund is to provide means of 
financing all social affairs to be given 
in the future. An assessment is pay-: 
able at the beginning of the year or 
by monthly installments. The fund 
is in charge of a committee to be ap­
pointed by the president of the De­
sign School, one member from each 
department.
The annual ball to be given every 
year is getting to be bigger and finer, 
so to finance the affair without im­
mediate assessments and help from 
outside, the fund was founded. The 
school seems heartily in favor of it 
and in the future a more definite un­
derstanding can be formed as to ex­
penses.
The annual Design school ball is 
fast gaining a place with other affairs, 
similar in nature. It is hoped in the 
near future that it may be to Pitts­
burgh as the Beaux Arts Ball is to 
New York, the Great London Ball
to London and the Quatre-Arts ball 
to Paris.
The fund may be used for any so­
cial function embracing the whole of 
the Design school.
Mr. Wilkins, a plebe, was elected 
second assistant basket ball manager 
to fill the vacancy made by the resig­
nation of the former occupant.
CLASS “A” PROJET.
The results of the Class “A” projet 
were very gratifying when compared 
with the other schools. Columbia 
University seemed to have gotten the 
bigger end of the deal at this judg­
ment. Several medals were given in

SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
DR. DAY SPEAKS AT GENERAL 
LECTURE.
On Wednesday morning, Novem­
ber 18, the students of the Science 
School were treated to an interesting 
lecture on different phases of Petrol­
eum and Gas Production by one of the 
leading experts of the world, Dr. 
David Day.
Dr. Day is a prominent engineer and 
geologist connected with the Bureau 
of Mines. In addition he is a 
leading exponent of technical educa­
tion especially along the lines of pe­
troleum and gas. It is rumored that 
his trip to Pittsburgh is in the en­
deavor to have a new engineering 
course established in Tech on petrol­
eum engineering.
The speaker was introduced by Di­
rector Hamerschlag, Dean Leete be­
ing absent because of sickness. Dr. 
Day stated that he desired to review 
the subject of petroleum and that he 
wished the students to make up their 
minds whether petroleum is of any 
value or whether it is not worth the 
time and money spent upon it.
Dr. Day, by means of a slide, showed 
the rapid increase in production of pe­
troleum and made the startling state­
ment that the increased use of books 
increases consumption of petroleum. 
The students were inclined to be 
amused at this but on a little explana­
tion by Dr. Day, every one agreed 
that there was some relation between 
books and petroleum.
After touching upon the consump­
tion in foreign countries, the topic of 
distribution of petroleum deposits was 
taken up. The amount that is pro­
duced in this country is enormous and 
will this year amount to 250,000,000 
barrels. At the present time there is 
only enough petroleum to last six 
months.
“The problem,” said Dr. Day, “will 
be to discover new oil fields and pe­
troleum deposits or else all mechan­
ical advance will cease.”
The need of more petroleum can 
thus be seen. The speaker after dwell­
ing for a time on the reviving of old 
wells by “shooting” them, turned his 
attention to some of the large oil 
fields in the country which are being 
successfully developed. Excellent 
view’s of the fields at Spindletop, 
Texas, and Cushing, Oklahoma, were 
shown and described. At the Cushing 
fields the petroleum amounts to 160,-
000 barrels per day, and the petroleum 
is of a very good grade.
The great fault with the oil well 
lies in the enormous waste encoun­
tered. This waste amount is causing a 
great deal of trouble but is gradually 
being overcome by engineers. Yet 
there is plenty of room for experi­
enced and talented engineers to take 
hold of the production and make the 
process work with a minimum of waste 
and a maximum length of production.
Other difficulties must be overcome, 
among them that of transportation. 
The “20 mule team”, ox teams, bur­
ros, and the like are very inefficient 
and some improved means for trans­
portation must be devised.
The method of fighting a fire in an 
oil well which has been struck by 
lightning is very original. Dr. Day 
happened to be near a large well tak­
ing motion pictures when the well was 
struck by lightning and obtained by 
good luck one of the most remarkable 
films ever taken.
This well had been struck by light­
ning very shortly after completion and 
as it was some distance from a place 
of supply, very ingenius methods for 
the control of the fire had to be de­
vised. The plan of obtaining boilers 
and making steam to throw on the 
fire was used, and with 25 boilers 
which had to be hauled a great dis­
tance, the fire was finally extinguished. 
The pictures were very interesting as 
was also Dr. Day’s address and every­
body united in a “Long Carnegie” for 
Dr. Day.

It is doubtful whether the plebes 
wTho come from various communities 
fully appreciate the intellectual and 
cultural tone of the district in which 
Tech is situated. Within the area of 
probably only one square mile are 
found a collection of buildings where 
the intellect and the higher tastes are 
developed as probably in no other 
area of the same size in the coun­
try.
Our own C. I. T. needs no descrip­
tion. We all know of the wonderful 
advantages to be derived by those 
who are in either of the four great 
schools. Also in the park, about five 
minutes’ walk from the Industries 
Building is the Phipps’ Conservatory, 
wThere are reared thousands of rare 
plants and flowers. Still within the 
park limits is Forbes Field, a mag­
nificent structure indeed. Coming 
back over the bridge we see the Car­
negie Library, which contains over
350,000 books and sets of over three 
hundred journals and periodicals. In 
the same building is also to be found 
the Department of the Museum con­
taining one million and a half objects 
of inestimable value, including the ex­
tensive collections in paleontology, 
fossil vertebrates, mineralogy, herbi- 
vology, entomology, archaeology, and 
ethnology. The Department of Fine 
Arts, including the Architectural and 
Sculptural Halls, and the world-famed 
art gallery, is also to be found here. 
Still within the same building is the 
Hall of Music where regular free or­
gan recitals and lectures of all kinds 
are held. This auditorium, by the

way, is the home of the Pittsburgh 
Academy of Science, and it is here 
that masterful lectures upon all kinds 
of scientific and literary subjects are 
delivered by men known the world 
over. Leaving the museum and going 
down Forbes street we come to the 
Hotel Schenley, known far and wide. 
A little up Grant boulevard is the 
Pittsburgh Athletic Association, one 
of the best equipped athletic houses 
in the country, and a place where one 
may develop not only physically but 
also along practically every other 
line. The P. A. A. has splendid club 
rooms and a fine auditorium and the 
members certainly use both to good 
advantage. On the left of the P. A. 
A. is the towering Soldiers’ Memorial 
Hall. Going up the hill we find the 
many massive buildings of the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh. It certainly 
is strange that two such great edu­
cational institutions as Pitt and Tech 
should be so closely situated.
And this district has only begun to 
rise! Many buildings of our own In­
stitute are still in the process of con­
struction and many more are yet to 
be started. On Bellefield avenue and 
Grant boulevard ground is soon to 
be broken for the most modern and 
best equipped high school building 
in the entire United States. It is 
to accommodate twenty-two hundred 
students and is to have any and all 
conveniences needed in an up-to-date 
high school. The great Masonic Tem­
ple near the P. A. A., when completely 
finished, will be the equal, if not the 
superior, of any lodge house in the 
country. We all know that the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh has just about 
begun to build. The question arises: 
With the standing that the district 
already has as an intellectual and 
civic center, what will that standing 
be when all structures contemplated 
within it are completed?
