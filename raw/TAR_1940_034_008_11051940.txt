Suave Swing Exponent 
Comes to Thistle Hall
Aline Barrett, TSo. 1 
Jittergirl, to Send 
Tunes for Lopez
Meet Anne Barrett, who will 
help “send” the jitterbug tunes for 
Vincent Lopez at the Military Ball 
this Friday. She is the gorgeous 
young lady at the right.
Anne started out to be a danc­
er in the days of her youth, but 
swing, which has induced more 
dancing than any other fad in 
American history, halted her 
promising career. She hardly re­
gards this as an unhappy circum­
stance, however, for it revealed to 
her a hitherto unknown talent— 
singing.
Changed To Singing 
Miss Barrett found that people 
were too busy gawking at jitter­
bug antics to bother with her 
dancing. She wasn’t licked yet 
though. After buying all the swing 
records as fast as they appeared 
on the market and spending hours 
listening to them, she soon discov­
ered that she could “get in the 
groove” vocally by singing accom­
paniments. It was when she ap­
peared with Lopez that she was 
acclaimed “America’s Number One 
Jittergirl.”
Speaking of the Aquacade, Vince 
is bringing his “suave swingers” 
straight from Master Billy’s , 
project at the New York World’s 
Fair. There some 3,000,000 people 
thrilled to Lopez’s startling ren­
ditions of “Nola” and “Kitten on 
the Keys.”
Started Early 
Piano playing has always been 
Vincent Lopez’s pastime. Almost 
before he was able to say those 
famous words: “Lopez speaking,” 
His parents, from whom he inher­
ited his love oi music, were de­
veloping his talent. Under this 
guidance he practiced six hours 
every day, trying to see how many 
scales he could run without a mis­
take. This probably accounts for 
his ability to finger 2,200 notes a 
minute. (If you don’t believe it ask 
Bob Ripley!) Recently Vince has 
added to his accomplishments 
stamp collecting, astrology and 
numerology. He also believes in 
music as an aid to the cure of 
sickness andxlisease. Pursuing this 
idea, he plays frequently before 
the patients of many New York 
hospitals.
Some of Vince’s other accomp­
lishments are: his band was the

Dr. Semon Gives 
Talks Concerning 
Synthetic Rubber
Dr. Waldo L. Semon, vice-presi­
dent of the Hydrocarbon Chemi­
cal and Rubber Company formed 
by the B. F. Goodrich Company, 
will discuss “Synthetic Rubber” 
in the development of which he 
has been an outstanding pioneer, 
in two addresses in Room 218, 
Engineering Hali on Thursday, 
November 7.
The first will be at 4:30 P. M. 
under the auspices of the Student 
Chapter, American Institute of 
Chemical Engineers. Chemistry 
and Chemical Engineering stu­
dents of both Pitt and Tech will 
be in attendance. At 6:30, a din­
ner will be held lor Dr. Semon 
at Carnegie Inn. He will repeat 
the same lecture at 8:30 P. M. 
under the auspices of the Pitts­
burgh Chemists Club, of which 
Dr. J. C. Warner is president, and 
the Pittsburgh Section, American 
Institute of Chemical Engineers, 
of which Prof. McCabe is now 
chairman. At the evening session. 
Dr. Semon will be introduced by 
Dr. Webster N. Jones.
Dr. Semon is the discoverer of 
Goodrich’s widely used Koroseal, 
a rubber-like material possessing 
several qualities, superior to . na­
tural rubber. He, with his assist­
ants, is also credited with the de­
velopment of Ameripol, which 
promises to be the long-sought 
Liberty Rubber for America.
Discovery of Ameripol involved 
experimentation with 5,000 syn­
thetic rubbers, in which Dr. Semon 
directed a staff of research chem-

Dramats Give 
Saga of South
Author, Paul Green, 
Won Pulitzer Prize
Presenting to Tech: Paul Green, 
author of the Drama Department’s 
forthcoming play, “The House of 
Connelly.”
Green, now 46, was born on a 
North Carolina farm and grew up 
on a farm, for 23 years., From 1914 
to 1916 he taught country school. 
He then entered the University of 
North Carolina, and a year later 
enlisted in the army where he 
served as private, corporal, ser­
geant and sergeant-major with the 
105th Engineers, 30tlvdivision; and 
later, as second lieutenant at 
Paris, served four months on the 
Western front. He returned in 
1919 to the University of North 
Carolina, graduating in 1921. He 
did graduate work there and at 
Cornell. At present he is a mem­
ber of the faculty at the Univer­
sity of North Carolina.
A great number of his plays are 
concerned with the Negroes. “He 
did not bother his head much over 
technique and esthetics of drama; 
he just wrote, pouring out what 
he had to say as best he could.” 
His first play was written in 1917. 
He has written of what he has seen 
and experienced, „what he knows 
and can interpret.
In 1926, he wrote the Pulitzer 
Prize - winning “In Abraham’s 
Bosom.” It was first produced in 
the Provincetown Theater, star­
ring Rose McClendon, since de­
ceased, one of the finest Negro act-

Fa.sl Tempo Floats 
From Thistle Hal!
By Helena Aronson
“Ah, come on, kids; let’s go. 
Maybe there won’t be six girls
lo every boy. Now that we are in 
collich, we should know how to 
navigate around a dance floor 
without getting caught in the shoe 
strings and trouser cuffs of every 
Joe Jitterbug. Pweez.”
So, off the widdle freshies trot­
ted to Thistle Hall, Tuesday af­
ternoon, to learn that the way to 
a man’s heart is by the conga. No 
more must a woman be able to 
beat out a plum pudding to pre­
serve marital bliss. The prime 
necessity is now that she be able 
to beat out a mean rhumba, tan­
go, . a fox-trot, or even a polka 
and a waltz. Who wants to dance 
with a plum pudding? No doubt, 
one of the many attractions at the 
next class will be an exceedingly 
charming couple from the ChalHf 
School of Dancing, Rockefeller 
Center, Ne\V York. The freshie 
women weren’t disappointed in 
the six feet three of handsome 
man dancing, and the boys would 
probably flght to the end to de­
fend the rights of Chaliff’s gracious 
dancing instructress.
The couple first demonstrated 
several antiquated steps and 
styles, including the old football- 
player-pumphandle in which the 
young man proceeds to fairly—or 
should we say unfairly.—mangle 
his poor, defenseless partner. 
(Has some one a hanky? This is 
killing me.) Mr. Turner and Miss 
Whitehead also presented some 
dancing styles in the modern man­
ner, a streamlined waltz, and a 
swingy polka.
The first lesson givfcn the group 
of almost 100 students consisted^ 
of several fundamental steps to 
conga rhythm. Lessons will be 
continued at a cost of fifty cents 
a person. The fees will be lowered 
if the class becomes larger.
“Now, kids, aren’t you glad you 
went? One, two, three, hop. One, 
twist, twist, hop. Whee, I’m con- 
going! Hey Marge, do you have 
fifty cents?”
Frat Pictures 
To Be Taken
Group pictures for Thistle are 
to be taken on Sunday, November 
10, in front of the respective .fra­
ternity houses.

Frosh Exam 
Results Sho w 
Hazing Passe
The Freshman Traditions exam­
inations have been graded and the 
results prove the new system of 
Freshman Regulations to be very 
effective. Of the three hundred 
odd students who look the test, 
two hundred forty-four passed, 
the grades ranging from zero— 
for one Freshman who wrote 
nothing but his name—to a per­
fect paper—achieved by only one 
student.
The test consisted of two parts, 
the first comprising twenty-eight 
questions about school traditions 
and general information. In the 
second part the students were re­
quired to write the first Verse of 
the ALMA MATER, the choruses 
to FIGHT FOR THE GLORY OF 
CARNEGIE, and DEAR OLD 
TECH, and the cheers THE IN­
STITUTE and SKIBO.
Lists of the students who pass­
ed the exam will be given to the 
Freshman mentors sometime dur­
ing the coming week. All Fresh­
men who passed the exam will 
receive a “Tech” recognition but­
ton from their mentors. Students 
who have no mentors should see 
the Deans of their respective 
schools. Lists of the students who 
passed will also be posted through­
out the school.
All Engineering and Art School 
Freshmen who did not take the 
test, or who did not pass it are 
required*—if they wish to enter 
into extracurricular activities—to 
take the re-exam. The time for 
the re-exam will bq posted later.

Beat Pitt!
Game Arrangements 
Are Very Complex
This Saturday thousands of stu­
dents, alumni, and others will en­
ter the Pitt Stadium to watch a 
football game. After the closing 
gun these thousands will leave, 
feeling gay, moody or indifferent. 
For them the game is a process 
of entering, cheering, and leaving. 
They have little conception of the 
tremendous amount of intricate 
preparation necessary before this 
mammoth spectacle can bo staged.
Most of this preparation has be­
come so much of a routine that 
few realize its extent or thor­
oughness. When fifty thousand or 
more persons are gathered togeth­
er in one stadium, great precau­
tions must be taken to insure their 
safety and protection.
Weeks ahead of the opening of 
football season, traffic experts are 
at work figuring out methods of 
handling the many automobiles 
arriving at the game. Parking lots 
have to be provided, an item which 
alone costs one thousand dollars 
per game. An observer atop the 
stadium watches approaching traf­
fic and directs the flow of cars 
into the most convenient parking 
lots. The stadium requires ap­
proximately one hundred police­
men, one hundred student ushers 
and Boy Scouts and fifty gatemen 
for a game such as this.

the stadium, an invisible but pow-

“Kilties Are Coming with Highland Fling”
By Saul Moses
One—kick front—kick back— 
down; one—kick front—kick back 
—down. The Kilties are coming, 
hurrah, hurrah!!
If you want to see the real 
Highland fling, come to Pitt sta­
dium, for the Pitt-Tech football 
game. Mr. Davidson, the bag-pipe 
teacher, a r-r-real Scotchman, has 
been instructing a number of the 
band members. Be a “first nighter” 
—see the Kiltie Fling. The fling 
as it will be performed Satur­
day is only one of many innova­
tions which have helped to make 
the Kiltie Band one of the coun- 
Watch this boy . . .
r5s4RpP wh Cd4“hO 
At the Pitt game
try’s outstanding college aggre­
gations.
The band, as we know it now, 
dressed in all of its Scottish fin­
ery, began its “modern” existence 
in the fall of 1922, first display­
ing its new wear (short but mod­
est) at the Tech-Notre Dame 
game. Boy, what a sight—an ar­
ray of shivering knees on that 
snowy day. The kilts were secur­
ed through contributions of stu­
dents, the Athletic Association, the 
Alumni Federation and other 
small groups.
The band, under the direction 
of Edward F. Sullivan (“Sully”), 
who came here in 1913, kept 
mainly to marching airs and col­
lege songs. “Sully,” a short, stocky 
fellow with an inspiring person­
ality, injected the spirit into the 
Tech band until it became a tra­
dition on campus.
After his untimely death came 
Dr. J. Vick O’Brien and swing. 
Dr. O'Brien brought an increased 
repertoire of concert selections, 
while time added swing—remem­
ber the “Kiltie Stomp,” “The Old 
Pitt Panther Ain’t What She Used 
To Be,” and “Where, Oh, Where 
Has My Little Dog Gone?” How 
can you forget?—we beat Pitt that 
year. Now Fred Graff, Music ’39, 
is Director of the Kilties.
The Kilties are greatly indebt­
ed to their “guardian angel,” Mr. 
Edward E. McDonald. It was 
largely through his efforts that 
the evening school contributed
money for kilts. The night school, 
alter exposing a few more shiver­
ing knees, decided that blankets 
were necessaiy to keep them 
warm on cold days and—now we 
got blankets. Mr. McDonald, an 
active member of Phi Mu Alpha, 
has never missed a Kiltie banquet 
and has received seventeen activi­
ties keys. Okay, boys, let’s have a 
roll of drums for McDonald— 
Boom!
Few people, realize the tremend­
ous amount of work that precedes 
the showing of formations at 
football games. Every member is 
given a drill manual, dealing with 
general maneuvering, drum ma­
jor signals, and songs. The man­
ual was compiled and mimeo­
graphed by our boy, Paul, the 
drum major, and copyread by the 
Lt. Shaffer of the R. O. T. C. de­
partment. All formations, fancy 
and otherwise, are also the brain­
children of Paul Wines.
If you ever go past the gym on 
Wednesday nights from seven 
o’clock to eight-thirty., you can 
just “barely” hear the Kilties in 
their “quiet” musical rehearsal. 
Quiet?—did you say?—Hell, I can 
hear them from the dorms. After 
the “quiet” session, the boys go 
down to the practice field to cavort 
around with new formations.
Have you heard the eight new 
bag-pipers? Boy, that’s some 
squeak! Mr. Louis Davidson, form­
er bag-pipe major of Stewardson 
Lloyd’s Cadet pipe band, has in­
structed a group of boys in this
ancient but difficult art.
Plug:: Wines
When Paul Wines came to Tech 
two years ago to study printing, 
the campus obtained a champion­
ship drum major. 1-Ie won the title 
of “All-American drum major” two 
summers ago at the World’s Fair. 
Paul has added distinction and 
color to the Kilties. Keep your 
eyes on Paul and his batons this 
Saturday. You’re in lor a treat.
Lest We Forget:
People forget but the Tartan 
remembers—the unthanked man 
of the Kiltie band—the man be­
hind the scenes—Ed Lewis, ’41, of 
Music dept., manager of the band. 
Ed makes all the arrangements for 
trips, concerts, rehearsals, tea 
dances, Thistle Hall, besides 
doubling on solo trumpet. He is al­
so student director of the Glee 
Club and a member of the swim­
ming team. A job has to be done 
—Ed is doing admirably well.
The famous Kiltie stomp had its 
inception in the Philadelphia train 
station three years ago after the 
Temple game. Some of the fellows 
were wet, from the rain, and not 
having time to change went into 
a dance to keep warm. Everybody 
liked it so well that it became a 
permanent feature. Another ver­
sion, I hear, is that the idea was 
taken from Minsky’s. Could be?
One—kick front—kick back— 
down; one—kick front—kick bad: 
—down. The Kilties are coming, 
hurrah, hurrah! We’re marching 
for the glory of Carnegie.
Wartime Classes

IFC Informal , 
Date Is Set
At the meeting of the Interfra­
ternity Council last Thursday, No­
vember 22 was set as the date 
for the Interfraternity dance in 
Thistle Hall. Bob Webb, ’42, is 
social chairman for the event 
which is open to fraternity men 
only. Bill Le Roy and his orches­
tra will probably furnish the mu­
sic.
The annual fraternity house 
grounds cup will be awarded on 
a slightly different basis this year. 
The houses will be judged each 
month instead, of during the 
Spring Carnival only, as in pre­
vious years. General appearance 
and greatest improvements of the 
grounds are the basis for the prize. 
As formerly, the cup will be 
awarded during Carnival.
Competition is being held also 
for the best Homecoming Day 
decorations. The winner, which 
will be announced one week from 
Friday, will receive a permanent 
cup.
All fraternities have signed a 
petition, which lias been presented 
to the administration for approv­
al, to permit women in the houses 
without chaperons until 7:00 P. M.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN
Election Climaxes 
Phoney Campaign
Today is election day. In every nook and cranny of the 
United States people will be canting their votes for one man or 
another.
Today is election day. It is flu? climax of a long campaign of 
mud-slinging. It is the climax of a campaign characterized by 
ul,I,ci- absence of issues or principles, a campaign which started by 
one man endorsing everything his opponent had done and delib­
erately ignoring the issues of the day. It was a campaign in which 
neither candidate had the courtesy to tell the American people 
;jusL exactly what he intended to do if elected. It was a campaign 
in which the people were asked to vote for a “leader’’ 011 faith. 
It was the phoniest campaign in twenty years.
At the time that both conventions were held, conscription 
was on the mind and tongue of every American citizen. Yet 
neither party even mentioned the word in its platform. That was 
an apt beginning for what followed. Both parties resorted to' 
name calling and both candidates contradicted themselves on 
every question they'discussed. It was a battle between Tweedle­
dum and Tweedlcdee.
11 is America’s shame that she should permit such burlesque 
at a time when a sane and thoughtful consideration of issues is 
most important.
A campaign in which the sole issue is whether a president 
should have a third term and which ignores the great problems 
of unemployment, of housing, of the rule of corrupt political ma­
chines, is no campaign at all. It is an insult to our intelligence. 
What, specificially, is to be done to make democracy work in 
America? How are we to put ten million men back to work? 
How are we to solve the problems of the sharecroppers and tenant 
farmers? How are Ave to provide housing for the one-third of the 
people who still need it ? How are we going to bring democracy 
lo the South? How are we to save democracy when our own ad­
ministration helps to maintain in power the Vargas dictatorship 
in Brazil and the Batista dictatorship in Cuba? IIow are we to 
create the healthy loyalty and love of country that is more im­
portant to defense than ten million soldiers? Are we to do 110 
more to solve the economic problems of our people than to provide 
a shameful dole? How are we to adjust ourselves to a system that 
is disintegrating before our eyes and which threatens to destroy 
democracy along with itself? How are we to safeguard academic 
freedom in the face of hysteria arid narrow-mindedness? These 
are problems that demand an answer. These are problems which 
the two major parties have deliberately ignored.
Yes, we have had comic relief. We have seen one man mod­
est enough to call himself “indispensable.” We have seen the 
other, the apostle of the capitalism that was, win the support of 
.John I Vo Lewis and t he Communist Party, We have had comic 
relief when we' should have had discussion of issues. We have 
.seen two men make a joke of what we hold sacred—the demo­
cratic way of life. If after months of ballyhoo and millions of 
'dollars’ worth of propaganda, you have found enough concrete 
J!aoIs to justify your choice, you are lucky.
We see no choice between the two.
Brain Teaser
<
Five men on n South Sea is­
land were employed in gather­
ing coconuts. At nightfall they 
piled all their coconuts near their 
tents, and went to sleep, having 
agreed that they Would divide the 
pile the next morning. One of the 
men, however, fearing that dur­
ing the night one of the others 
migl?t steal some coconuts from 
the pile, got up and counted, his 
share, putting one coconut in his 
own pile for every four that ho 
put in a second pile for the oth­
ers. At the end of the process he
had one coconut left over, which 
he gave to the moniceys. His own 
share he hid in the bushes and 
then went back to sleep. A little 
later a second man got up; not 
knowing of the first man’s action, 
he took one-fifth of the remainder 
of the pile, and likewise had one 
odd coconut left, which he, too, 
gave to the monkeys. Each of the 
other men repeated this process, 
each time throwing away one 
coconut and taking just one-fifth 
of the remainder. Now, the ques­
tion is, what is the least number 
of coconuts that could have been 
in the pile originally?

First annual meeting of Phi 
Kappa Phi will be held on Wed­
nesday, November G, at 4:30 in 
room 251 Industries Hall. Candi- 
didates for offices for the following 
year will be selected at this meet­
ing.
Lower Checking
At its last meeting Student 
Council moved that checking rates 
for all future dances will be re­
duced to five cents.
M. M. Senate Meets
On Thursday at 4:30 in the 
Council Room in the Union, the 
Margaret Morrison Senate will 
meet and discuss a recent confer­
ence for Presidents oi’ organiza­
tions that was held at Allegheny 
College. Janet Stover '41, was 
Carnegie’s representative.
Vacation Changes
The possibility of extending the 
Christmas vacation an extra day 
to make it easier for out-of-town 
students to get back to school was 
discussed at the Student Council 
meeting Thursday. Mr. Floyd ap­
pointed Margaret Sullivan to head 
a committee to meet with Dr. 
Ilnig and Dr. Warden and work 
out a satisfactory arrangement. 
At the same time they will try to 
straighten out the difficulties as­
sociated with the Easter vacation.
Math Cluh To Meet
The second meeting of the year 
of the undergraduate Mathemat­
ics Club will be held Friday, No­
vember 8,. at 4:30, in Room 201, 
Engineering Hall. Ralph Beatty, 
Math ’42, will discuss alignment 
charts.
The general theory, with prac­
tical. directions for the construc­
tion and use of computation charts 
will be presented from an ele­
mentary point of view. Everyone 
who is interested is invited to at­
tend.
Class Ring Lost
Have you, or do you know of 
anyone who has lost a Carnegie 
Tech class ring with the initials 
M. E. H.? Well, it’s been found— 
in no less a place than a rest room 
on top of Laurel Mountain in 
Somerset County.
If your initials are M. E. H., and 
you have lost a class ring you can 
get same by writing to Mrs. L. S. 
Yeager, of Thomas, West Virginia.
Inter-Honorary Meets
The Inter-Honorary • Council 
met Monday, October 28th, and 
discussed plans for the year. 
Among these plans was the spon­
sorship of a spelling and diction 
contest for freshmen. Also plan­
ned was an educational program 
to consist of lectures and discus­
sions. Perhaps the biggest under­
taking thought of was a Spring 
Formal to be given sometime next 
spring for the purpose of bringing 
together members of the various 
honoraries to get acquainted with 
each other.
It is announced that Nu Sigma 
Alpha, a night school honorary, 
has been admitted to the council, 
and hopes are high that this will 
bring about a closer cooperation 
between night and day school. 
Mr. R. C. Barber is the represen­
tative from Nu Sigma Alpha.
Scottie Meeting
There will be a Scottie meet­
ing tonight at 7:30 in the Car­
negie Union.
All Seniors Notice
Arrangements for having pic­
tures taken for the Thistle may 
be made daily from 11:30 to 1:30

“Delicious and refresh­

hilarating and a refreshed 
feeling follows. Thirst

resses. She also played “Big Sis,” 
later, in a production of “The 
House of Connelly.” In about 
1930, “The House of Connelly” 
was first produced by the Group 
Theater in New York. During 
preparation for the show, with 
Mary Morris playing Mrs. Con­
nelly, Mr. Green was present at 
all rehearsals and gave many 
needed and helpful suggestions 
due to his knowledge of the South. 
Although he has been unable to 
attend any of the Drama Depart­
ment rehearsals, it is hoped that 
he will be present for one of the 
performances. Mary Morris wrote 
to Mr. Green, asking certain ques­
tions about the play. In answer­
ing, he said, “I am glad you are 
now working in a real people’s 
theater,” by which he meant a 
theater where people are doing 
plays they consider really worth 
doing and audiences are coming 
to see them because they really 
wish to see those plays—in con­
trast to the commercialism of 
Broadway.
About two years after producing 
“The House of Connelly,” the 
Group Theater presented “Johnny 
Johnson,” a play with .music, in 
which Green expressed his feel­
ings about war. Green has a 
great love for .all mankind, and 
he believes that peace is impos­
sible until the formation of some 
tremendous international organi­
zation. In “Johnny Johnson,” 
there is a scene on the battlefield 
where the American soldier, John­
ny Johnson, holds a dying Ger­
man boy of about 18, in his arms. 
Through this scene, he gets the 
deep underlying brotherhood 
among men and shows how ridic­
ulous war is.
Mr. Green is now in a commit­
tee for providing entertainment 
for all men going into defense 
preparation. The task of the 
committee is to organize the men 
to do their own dramatic work. In 
spite of his achievements as a 
writer, rather than devote his 
time solely to writing of the thea­
ter, he prefers to instruct young 
people in the Drama Department 
of the University.
Don’t forget to get your tickets 
for “The House of Connelly” in 
the Registrar’s Office starting to­
day.

TUESDAY, NOVEMBER 5, 1940THE CARNEGIE TARTAN3
butterscotch
By Ed Hunt
Pinch-hitting or hit-pinching, whichever you prefer, is bound 
to be fun if it’s done under sympathetic circumstances. These 
are sympathetic circumstances, because I like Ruth Brodie and 
I am very sympathetic to her, and writing for Tech readers is 
nice, because they’ve always been very sympathetic to me.
Dr. Semon ... Pitt Game ... The Road to ^ «»•
I don’t know what I’ve done to deserve this beautiful sym­
pathy unless it was to write a play. A simple little comedy— 
charming in its simplicity, probably the simplest little comedy 
ever written.
Which all boils down to the idea that there is always room 
for comedy unless same is written by William Saroyan, whom X 
dislike. (We, on the contrary, like him very much.—R. B.) He 
is not sympathetic. By saying that I dislike him, I don’t mean 
that he is a boil on the scruff,of the world’s neck; he isn’t. He 
is quite another matter. He is a boil on another portion of wordly 
anatomy.
Still Saroyan has something to say. He says it’s a good world, 
and while present conditions in the majority of this sphere may 
lead us to question the intrinsic truth of such a statement, it is 
not a bad idea to have people saying it.
As I see it, Mr. Saroyan could have said, “Keep youi* sense 
of humor.” Of course, this may be implied, but still, it is also a 
good thing to specify. Mr: Hitler, for instance, could never make 
half the faces or gestures he does, if lie could turn the humorous 
eye now and then upon himself. On the other hand, Premier 
Mussolini could not do those magnificent things with Italy and liis 
chin if he had as much humor as spaghetti.
So, if American youth could keep itself 'down a little on 
its self-importance, and keep the idea of examing itself, now and 
then, it could never develop into a nation of regimented and uni­
formed unknown quantities. After all, to exaggerate, you can­
not conceive a community made up of Al Jolson, Ed Wynn, Bus­
ter Keaton, Mary Boland, Charlie Chaplin, Bea Lillie, Fannie 
Brice, “Edna May Oliver, and an uncle of mine who is a wonder on 
church socials, living in utter arid complete subjugation to any­
thing.
So, in case you think the new draft has “done you in,” to coin 
a phrase, just look at the R. 0. T. C. While they all are not as 
funny as Jack Benny, Bea Lillie, Ed Wynn, and my afore-men­
tioned uncle who is a wonder 011 church socials, still they do not 
seem to be too crushed in the individualism. In short, if you can 
.lust think of yourself doing anything and see that tiny spark 
of the ridiculous, then you, my friends, will never become men­
aces to world civilization—and neither will those who are, if you 
just give them a giggle now and then.

ists, chemical engineers and com­
pounders from test tube stages 
through pilot plant and semi-com- 
merciai operations.
The new product achieves the 
goal of being made from abundant 
and cheap domestic materials and 
is now being fashioned into auto 
tires and other rubber articles.
Although at present more ex­
pensive than rubber, research on 
synthetic production is being 
pushed by Goodrich Company, it 
was recently announced, as a de­
fense measure in the hope of even­
tually freeing America of depend­
ence on foreign rubber supplies.
Born in Demopolis, Ala., Dr. 
Semon did chemical work for the 
U. S. Intelligence service during 
the war while still an undergrad­
uate at the University of Washing­
ton. Graduated with high scholas­
tic honors, a brilliant scientific 
career led him to the Goodrich 
Company where he is now, at 42, 
vice-president and director of re­
search at the Hydrocarbon Chem­
ical and Rubber Company, jointly 
formed by the Goodrich Company 
and the Phillips Petroleum Com­
pany for the development of syn­
thetic rubbers.
A giant of a man with a rare 
scientific balance, his vivid imag­
ination led to the creation of Kor- 
oseal from basic materials of .coal, 
limestone and salt.
Ameripol’s basic raw material 
is American petroleum, which Dr. 
Semon, by the cracking process, 
broke down to a mixture of simple 
molecules, separating from this 
gas which under pressure liquifies 
to give butadiene. This is mixed 
with other ingredients prepared 
from American agricultural sourc­
es. Upon heating and agitation, 
these ingredients react to form an 
emulsion of synthetic rubber, sim­
ilar to the latex obtained from 
rubber-producing trees.

The detailed solution to this 
problem would be too long and 
would involve too much algebraic 
notation to be reproduced here. 
The method, however, is to let X 
represent the number of coconuts 
in the pile originally, and let Y 
represent the number left after all 
the men had removed what they 
thought were their shares.
A single equation involving X 
and Y is easily obtained. This one 
equation (called an indeterminate 
or Diophantine equation) is 
enough to determine the two un­
knowns, since it is known that X 
and Y must be positive whole 
numbers, and it is specified that 
the smallest value of X shall be 
chosen. The answer proves to be 
X equals 3121 and Y equals 1020. 
The method of solution is explain­
ed in Charles Smith’s “Treatise 
on Algebra,” pp. 503-505, which 
is available in the Science Library 
in Engineering Hall', if anyone 
cares to look it up. The method 
given there is applicable to a 
variety of problems; the only al­
ternative to its use seems to bo 
pure guessing.
It is possible to generalize the 
problem a great deal and still ob­
tain formulas for the solutions 
which are so simple that it will be 
practicable to give them here, 
partly in words. Suppose that 
there were N men picking coco­
nuts, of whom only N got up dur­
ing the night and removed what 
they thought to be their shares 
and suppose that R extra coconuts 
were given to the monkeys each 
time. Then the least number of 
coconuts which could have been 
in the pile originally is (N ex­
ponent K), minus R Vol plus R. 
Any other solution differs from 
this by some multiple of (N ex­
ponent K). The number of coco­
nuts left in the pile by morning 
is at least (N-l) exponent K, 
minus RN, plus R. Any other so­
lution differs from this by some 
multiple of [(N-l)l exponent K, 
The numerical answers given 
above may be found from these 
formulas by setting N,K, and R 
equal to 5,5, and 1, respectively.

and first aid rooms are all avail­
able for instant use. Patrolmen 
are ever on the alert for trouble 
makers, violent rooters, and dis­
orderly drunks.
Refreshments and programs will 
also play an important role in the 
mental and physical contentment 
of the spectators. Approximately 
5,000 hot dogs, 8,000 ice cream 
bars, and 1,500 bottles of soft 
drinks will be sold. Seventy boys 
are employed to “huckster.” Pro­
grams are planned before the sea­
son starts by the athletic mana- 
tional advertising. Programs have 
been made more and more inter­
esting by the inclusion of finer 
photographs, cartoons, sports com­
ments, etc., so that the reader will 
keep his copy as a souvenir of the 
game. This makes the football 
program a valuable advertising 
medium. Athletic managers must 
estimate the attendance of each 
game beforehand so that the print­
er will know how many copies 
of the program to turn out. (Sales 
estimate: 1 copy to every 3 per­
sons.)
In midsummer, tickets are plan­
ned, publicity sent out, applica­
tions filed, and reservations made. 
Quantities of tickets are alloted to 
drug stores, department stores, 
hotels, etc. Every sale must be 
checked and recorded. After the 
total accounting is, made, the 
money must be assembled for Fed­
eral tax inspection. Along with 
tickets must come advertising ma­
terials for store windows, pictures 
of individual stars, and photo­
graphs of the whole team. Stu­
dent sports writers must usually 
supply information on the condi­
tion of the team, the results of 
practice sessions, and the general 
outlook since few newspapers care 
to send writers to the practice 
games. Odd requests for special 
privileges make the job more 
complicated. A cripple desires to 
drive his car into the stadium, a 
non-collegiate boy friend wants to 
sit with his coed sweetheart in the 
student section, the president of 
Student Council and editor of the; 
Thistle in 1922 would like to sit 
on the fifty-yard line, etc., etc. 
Complimentary ticket lists must 
be also checked by weeding out 
chiselers and determining legiti­
mate requests.
Accommodations in the press- 
box for visiting newspapermen, 
radio commentators, cameramen, 
and student spotters have to be 
arranged on short notice. Two 
students representing Pitt and 
Tech will sit beside the announcer 
with a large diagram containing 
the names and numbers of the 
players on their respective teams. 
When a play is made, they will 
point to the names of the men re­
sponsible for the offense and de­
fense. The . announcer will then 
broadcast these names.
Thus the football machine turns, 
affecting directly or indirectly the 
lives of millions. Are you going 
to the game on Saturday?

Tliomas Condemns Blind Faith 
Displayed By American People
By G. K.
“We would not have conscrip­
tion today if it were not for the 
apathy and the desire for the 
lesser of two evils exhibited by 
the American people.” These were 
tlie words ol Norman Thomas, 
Socialist candidate for President 
in a fiery address at. the Carnegie 
Lecture Hall of Friday evening 
to an enthusiastic audience.
After humorously denying any 
affiliation with the Communist 
Party, Thomas went on to defend 
the position of Earl Browder, 
whom he claims was railroaded on 
a minor technical charge. He 
heartily condemned the miscar­
riage of justice which gave Brow­
der a four year term and caused 
the deportation of his wife when 
the support of the Communists 
shifted from the Democratic to 
the Republican Party. Thomas 
proposed the starting of legisla­
tion for federal elections to safe­
guard the rights of certain minor­
ities. This legislation would elmin- 
ate the poll tax for presidential 
elections, provide for the uniform 
administering of literacy tests es­
pecially among southern Negroes, 
divide the electoral vote in pro-

candidates on the ballot.
Mr. Thomas thinks that the 
coming election is a sham. Both 
parties are equally vague on im­
portant issues such as the ques­
tion of neutrality, and are not con­
sistent in their denunciations and 
accusations of one ailother. The 
present political struggle is a con­
flict of personalities and not for 
principles. “Willkie has endorsed 
all the reforms which Roosevelt 
took from the Socialist party.” 
Roosevelt, on the other hand, made 
no mennon of the draft until his 
acceptance of the renomination. 
Since he was “drafted” he felt that 
other Americans should enjoy the 
same privilege.
Mr. Thomas th|nks the way to 
avoid war is to refrain from im­
perialistic adventures. The draft, 
by making available many extra 
armed forces, will encourage such 
ventures.
In closing, the Socialist candi­
date stressed the fact that a vote 
for him would not be a “vote 
thrown away” since it is only 
through the popular support of 
minor parties that the powerful 
political machines are made to 
realize that the public desires re­
forms far different from those 
commonly proposed.

Weather conditions are against 
the enthusiasts of field hockey, 
but the teamsters are braving all 
such conditions and are carrying 
out schedules as planned. The sea­
son for the sport is nearly over 
and we know some of you are sor­
ry because you just didn’t have 
time to come out for practices, 
even though it is one of your fav­
orite games. But now the season 
is about finished and you’ve not.

to our and your sorrow. See, 
however, that you learn the les­

your having participated in this,, 
your own, W. A. A.
The swimming party, an event 
every aquatic duck at Tech looks 
forward to, is coming up on No­
vember 15, from 8:00 until 10:30. 
There will be exhibition swim­

evening is planned so that you will 
all have fun. Come in couples, 
singles, triples, any old way, just 
come, jump into your suit and

you’ll have a splashingly good 
time.
Revenge in Game 
With Pitt Panther
Outplayed Cats 
Beat Tech in 
Final Minu tes
This coming Saturday, the over­
worked Tartan team goes back to 
work and meets Pitt at the Sta­
dium for their annual clash. This 
is always one of the best games 
of the year since both teams are 
keyed up for the contest and stu­
dent feeling runs high. This year, 
the Panthers have a relatively 
better record than the Tartans, in 
addition to two weeks rest, and 
should be one of our toughest op­
ponents this season.
Thus far this season, Pitt has 
defeated Missouri by one touch­
down, tied Southern Methodist 
7-7, lost to Ohio State by four 
touchdowns, and lost to Fordham 
24-12.
Left half “Special Delivery 
Jones” has been playing very good 
ball for the Panthers, making 
spectacular runs and throwing ac­
curate passes. Kracum at full­
back, Mike Sekela at quarter, and 
Bob Thurbon at right half com­
pose the remainder of the first 
string backfield. The line is com­
posed of Rettinger and Gervelis 
at ends, Konetsky and Benz at 
tackles, Gradisek and Fife at 
guards, and Steve Sinco at center.
Carnegie Tech’s luckless Skibo 
squad lost another tough game 
last Saturday to a desperate Cin­
cinnati eleven by the low score 
of 7-0. The Bearcats were out­
played completely until the final 
minute of the game when they 
scored and converted to lead Tech 
by one point. The game was a 
tale of two runs. In the third 
period, George Muha reeled off a 
32 yard dash over right tackle 
and reversed his field to cross 
the goal line untouched, making 
the score 6-0. In the final minute
of play, Cincinnati’s safety man, 
Den Davis, took a punt on his 
own 35 and ran through the en­
tire Tech team to score what prov­
ed to be the decisive score.
Early in the second period, Tech 
drove to the Bearcat six yard line 
but lost ground on several run­
ning plays. Charley Braun went 
in to attempt a field goal but the 
try was blocked by the Cincinnati 
right tackle, Macikas. Outside of 
the two touchdown plays, this was 
the only scoring threat made by 
either team.
After Big George Muha scored in 
the third period, he also made 
the attempt for conversion, but 
Tech was penalized 15 yards for 
holding and the ball went back to 
the 17 yard line. This time a pass 
was tried, but Tony Laposki was 
«•topped on the four after snagging 
the pass from John McLaughlin. 
Tech came right back from Cin­
cinnati’s last minute score and 
moved from their own 34 to the 
Bearcat 29 where the game end­
ed. A pass from Bill Johnson to 
Joe Pash netted 36 yards in this 
final futile attempt to overtake 
Cincinnati.
With the exception of the touch­
down run by Davis, Cincinnati did 
nothing spectacular, making only 
one first down to Tech’s twenty. 
Tech made a total of 212 yards 
rushing to Cincinnati’s 40 and 
made 110 yards through the air 
on five out of thirteen attempts. 
The Bearcats tried nine passes, 
completing one on interference 
and had two intercepted. With 
Tommy Lonchar back in the line­
up, the Cincinnati eleven held the 
advantage in punting, having a 
48 yard average.
Skibos Will SeekPANTHER STALWARTS
Edgar Jones and Stan Gervelis have been two of the mainstays in 
the Pitt attack all season. Tech followers will well remember the 
touchdown heave of “Special Delivery” Jones, that spelled a 6-0 defeat 
for the Tartans last year. The Skibos will also have to stop Mike 
Sekela, quarterback, and George Kracum, fullbacks. Plugging up 
the hole at center will be “Stalwart Steve” Sinco.

HOME AGAIN, HOME AGAINseven as the half ended.
The third quarter produced the 
best playing of the game. Tech 
started to play a wide open game, 
mixing' passes with running 
plays. The Saints banged the ball 
to the Tech forty live by hitting 
the line and circling the ends. 
From here they passed to the 
twenty. With first and ten Vin­
cent failed to score. A pass on 
the fourth down went into the 
end zone which automatically 
placed the ball on the Tech twenty. 
Cantini went back to punt 011 his 
own fourteen only to have it 
blocked by the incoming lineman, 
Quatse. A quarterback sneak and 
two running plays moved, the ball 
to the Tech three for a first down. 
The next play saw the ball resting 
on pay dirt and another score for 
Vincent. An attempt to convert 
via a drop kick was foiled when 
the kick was blocked.
Philipchuk carried the majority 
of the fourth quarter for the Ski- 
bos. Passes were clicking with 
him on the receiving end and his 
runs picked up many yards. Again 
desperately the Freshmen passed 
their way to their forty then com­
pleted another on Vincent’s forty 
and carried it to the twenty as the 
final gun ended the game.
Saints Convert 
Skihos’ Fumble 
Into Win, 19-0
By Jim Golst
The fray between the Tech 
freshmen and St. Vincent fresh­
men was played on the neutral 
territory ol the Jeanette High 
School field. Capitalizing on 
breaks, St. Vincent pushed across 
three touchdowns and converted 
once. The Plebes played well in 
spurts in the second, third and 
fourth quarters. On the whole 
St. Vincent was in Tech territory.
Both teams gave rise to a see­
saw first quarter. Fumbles were 
frequent and running plays were 
stopped. The second quarter 
started the fireworks. After re­
covering a Tech fumble the boys 
from Latrobe clicked off a first 
down to place the ball on Tech’s 
six yard line. On the first play 
the Plebe line yielded three yards 
leaving three yards to go. From 
here the Big Green punctured the 
Tartan line for a score. A place­
ment added the extra point. One 
of the Skibo’s drives began after 
receiving Vincent’s kick-off. A 
sustained charge saw a rejuvinat- 
ed Plebe team slash off yard after 
yard to bring the ball deep into 
the Saint’s territory. On an off 
tackle slash Byers dashed to the 
twenty where he was hit with a 
terrific tackle which caused a 
heart-breaking fumble. Vincent 
was forced to punt following sev­
eral unsuccessful plays. With 
their backs to the wall and the 
half drawing to a close, the Plaid 
freshmen in a desperate attempt 
passed on their own twenty yard 
line. An alert Vincent secondary 
snatched the ball from the arms oil 
the Intended receiver and lugged 
it through several ladders only 
to be downed on the Tech twenty

We Lost
Upon hearing the score of the Carnegie Tecli-Cincinnati game 
last Saturday evening my first, thought was that our team could 
definitely be listed as one of those aggregations that was reel hot 
one week and ice cold the other. This impression of our war­
riors remained a part of me until I read the Sunday papers, for 
then I was given a true picture of the latest of our Western 
disasters. .
The opening sentence of the article I read ran something like 
this: “Although eompetelv outclassed, and thoroughly outplayed, 
the Bearcat squad from Cincinnati yesterday went home 011 the 
long end of a 7-6 score.’’ Further in the article a list of statistics 
were given which tend to tell a story of their own. Tech made 
twenty (20) first downs to the Bearcats’ one (1), Carnegie gained 
212 yards from the scrimmage line in rushing while the Ohioans 
were held to a measly 40 yards, and the Tartans completed five 
passes while the men from Cincy snagged one (on interference). 
All of this serves to show that the 1940 Skibo football sqnad is 
truly a luckless outfit. With a few breaks here and there many 
persons thoroughly acquainted with the Carnegie football machine 
emphatically state that the outcome of several Tech versus So and 
So gridiron contests would be entirely different.
No Extra Charge Saturday
For the past series of football games with our rivals across the 
Gulf of Forbes we (the students of the Institute), have been asked 
to pay 50 cents if we wanted to see the game. This season, for the 
first time in a long period of years, the officials of the two schools 
have decided the Techites will not be required to pay this addi­
tional fee. . Should you or you wish to go to the game this coming 
Saturday the proceedure is simple. Merely walk, run or ride to 
the Carnegie Tech section in the Stadium, then present your 
athletic card to the attendant. From then on it’s up to you to find 
your own seat. No additional ticket, ribbon, or card is needed.
Intramural Football Nears Climax
For a number of weeks members of the various Intramural 
squads have been punching away at each other attempting to de­
termine which; is the superior of the two groups engaged. An 
elimination tournament was set up which only helped to intensify 
the rivalry and activity of each contest. The contestants have 
now wittled themselves down until now only three squads remain 
in line for first honors—they are, the Junior Metallurgists, the 
DU.’s, and the men of old Delta Tan. Each of these teams boast 
a well balanced team with capable men in each position, however, 
Shymowsky and Dierker of the Metallurgists, Ilevre and Hobbs of 
the DU’s, and Lochhead and Van Ordt of the Delt team seem to 
be the spark plugs of their respective squads.
The final games in this.tournament are to be played sometime 
during tHis week. All games start, promptly at 4:30, and are 
playecV on the various fields marked off on the cut. To top off a 
day at school stop and watch these squads blast at each other 011 
your way. home.
Shown above is Bob Thurbon whose fine running and kicking will 
make him a dangerous threat throughout next Saturday’s Pitt-Tech 
game.

The Tech booters journeyed to 
Grove City last Friday to engage 
the Rovers in a game which was 
won by Grove City 2-0. Both 
Rover points came within two 
minutes in the second quarter, the 
first from scrimmage in front of 
the goal and the second on an 
eighteen yard kick by their in­
side left. The Skibos’ only score 
was nullified because they were 
off-side.
The teams were evenly matched 
although they were slowed itp con­
siderably by the six inches of mud 
that covered the field. Bill White, 
the center-half back, was Tech’s 
outstanding player.

Last Friday in that drizzling rain 
Tech’s cross-country squad ran 
against Westminster’s crack team. 
Tech lost by the very close score 
of 2(> to 29. If you recall, Tech 
lost by a very one-sided score to 
Slippery Rock, and Westminster 
beat Slippery Rock’s competent 
harriers. This fact indicates a 
vast improvement in the Skibo 
squad.
Edwards, Westminister’s cap­
tain, finished first, and Marcin, 
Teresi. and Hardy were Tech’s 
first men. Coach Halferty says 
that this year’s team’s spirit sur­
passes that of any other team that 
lie has coached, and that it is a 
real pleasure to work with them. 
Next week the squad finishes its 
season with a meet here against 
Bethany College.

In Gym Nov. 9
Rumoresk
Fine Arts College will hold their 
annual Armistice Day Ball in the 
gymnasium next Saturday eve­
ning, November 9.
This is one. of the oldest tradi­
tional events on the campus, artd 
the decorations always carry out 
the military theme. This year, as 
in years past, the committee will 
make use oi' the decorations used 
for the Day School Military Ball.
Music for the occasion will be 
furnished by Rusty Williams and 
his band, who made such a good 
impression with his “Rhythms by 
Williams," at his last campus ap­
pearance, that the committee 
brought him back.
Everyone knows what a dance 
at the gymnasium means—a large 
crowd and plenty of fun, a smooth 
swing band and all the room in 
the world for dancing. If for no 
other reason, of course, many of 
the other students go to a Fine 
Arts Ball just to see how the 
“artists” take care of their deco­
rations. This time there will be 
a patriotic color scheme (for Arm­
istice Day). The gymnasium will 
be draped with flags and the fam­
ous, high-hung crystal ball will 
revolve slowly on its pivot, catch­
ing reflections from the colored 
ceiling lights and casting them 
upon the floor in kaleidoscopic 
pattern. As the dancers weave in 
and out through the waves of 
color, the "workers” will give cor­
sages of roses to the girls.
Fine Arts students will be ad­
mitted by showing their registra­
tion cards, while the other stu­
dents must pay $1.00. This dance 
will be in charge, of the new offic­
ers of the Arts College: Mr. Fred 
Fargotstein, president; John De- 
Luca, vice president; Lou Fosner, 
secretary; and Robert MJetcalf, 
treasurer.
Thanksgiving“ O
Recess Begins 
November 28
So again, as many a year be­
fore, Thanksgiving Day is ap­
proaching with its usual fuss and 
feathers. But it scyjnis that there 
has been more fuss than feathers 
about the probable date for the 
holiday.
Last year, as you know, Presi­
dent Roosevelt advanced the time 
for Thanksgiving a week ahead, 
but this year Governor James has 
issued a proclamation stating 
that Thanksgiving Day will again 
be celebrated on its usual pre- 
11)39 last Thursday of the month. 
The result is that Thanksgiving 
recess begins on the 28th instead 
of the 21st as originally printed 
in the Handbook.
So the Plaid takes this occasion 
to remind you to mark Thursday, 
Friday, and Saturday, the 28th, 
29th, and 30th—in your Handbook 
qs the correct time to relax. And 
as another reminder, don’t forget 
the Thanksgiving Dance on the 
29 th.

Right oil the bat, we would like 
to entice you gentlemen up to the

You’ve probably all heard about 
the very ritzy opening of the Am­

you haven’t heard about Dyke

was there with a couple of girls 
left over from the Rodeo who 
went “Yippee” with plenty of 
range every time they saw a horse 
painting—and there were lots of 
horses.
You were at the Industries 
dance, no? Nice except that after 
the music gets batted back and 
forth among the rafters, there’s 
not much left of the rhythm. We 
vote for Thistle Hall. Ronnie 
Shofl! and girl friend Jean, seemed 
to enjoy themselves, though—es­
pecially since ShoiT rated a comp­
limentary boutonniere. Graft, so 
soon?
Jim Miller was there, too, with 
some blond. Always something

hand, it’s very nice of Jim to 
scatter his favors around among 
all us girls.
Next Tuesday, November 11, 
we will pause long enough in our 
mad race to rearm, to pay tribute 
to the men who, back in 1917, 
Went through the same procedure 
in a vain effort to “save the world 
for democracy.” The present state 
of world affairs is strong evidence 
of. the fact that they failed.
Yes, they failed, but it wasn't 
because they didn’t fight a good 
fight, and it wasn’t because they 
didn’t have faith in the ideals they 
were fighting for, they failed be­
cause this world is ruled by civil­
ized human beings who possess 
that characteristically human 
trait of always desiring what the 
other fellow has. And because we, 
are also human, it takes only the 
waving of flags, the blare of bands, 
or the equally stirring blare of 
propoganda-spreading journalists, 
to convince us that our leaders 
are right, and therefore the cause 
for which they are fighting must 
be right. It is not my intent to 
say who is right, or wrong, in this

say that perhaps we are not as

selves, for even the beasts of the

Handbook Supply 
Being Held At 
Registrar’s Desk
Do you have your handbook? 
The latest report from the Reg­
istrar’s Office is that there are 
still some books without own­
ers. Or, perhaps, you don’t 
know that you are entitled, to a 
handbook. Every student that is 
registered in the evening school 
can get one. Just present your 
registration card at the Registrar’s 
Office any evening and ask for 
your handbook. This book is in­
dispensable because it contains a 
calendar of school events and a 
great deal of other very useful 
informatipn; including rules for 
some hand-books that don’t have 
eligibility and tenure of evening 
school offices, and official regula­
tions for the guidance of evening, 
and part-time students that Was 
previously published as a separ­
ate book.
of all the other types as their 
common aim. Of course not, yet 
we who are constantly using reams 
of words to tell ourselves -how 
much better we are because we 
can think, are doing just that. 
Naturally, the advantages of be­
ing able to think constructively 
are too numerous too mention 
here, but when this power is mis­
directed its disadvantages are not 
only numerous, they are horribly 
dangerous.
To every man, woman and child 
living toaay the results of the last 
great conflict should be proof 
enough that you can’t save the 
world from anything by “mass 
murder.”
Are we going to say that all 
those men, who fought and died so 
bravely, taught us absolutely 
nothing, or are we going to rec­
ognize their lesson of “caution,” 
pausing and considering very 
carefully the course we are go­
ing to take.
This Armistice Day let us 
pledge ourselves to honor those 
men by making our nation one 
dedicated to peace. Even though 
present world conditions may 
make it necessary for us to build 
up our military strength, let us 
be sure that it shall never be used 
to create another “Flanders Field.”
Annual Plii Nu 
Dance December 7
Football schedules are not the 
only things that change because 
of Thanksgiving uncertainties. This 
year, Pennsylvania observes the 
traditional hoiiuay; November 28.
The tentative date of Phi Nu’s 
annual dance was set to agree 
with the November 21st Thanks­
giving and was to be held No­
vember 30, but the change in holi­
day schedules has altered the 
dance committees’ plans. Advant­
age has been taken of the choice 
week-end previously reserved for 
the Thanksgiving recess. The 
dance will be held Saturday night, 
December 7.
The students are assured that 
this change will: not affect the 
plans for the dance. One of the 
best orchestras in the district is 
being contracted for the evening’s 
pleasure.________________________________
Not Many Changes 
Since Year 1923
Article Reprinted From An Old 
“Skibo” November 1, 1923.
After wearing out the elbows 
of my coat and the toes of my 
shoes trying to push, edge and 
kick my way into the Registrar’s 
Office, I finally managed to make 
my wants known to the fellow in 
charge. When my wants were 
gratified, I found I had landed 
in the Steel and Heat Treating 
Class in the College of Industries 
where I found Professor Taylor 
and about eight other very good 
fellows to work with.
I was impressed most favorably 
the first night I attended from the 
fact that we got away to a very 
good start. I was given a piece of 
steel to heat and forge under the 
hammer. I knew as much about 
hammering as a hog does about 
Sunday, but I will venture to say 
that under the tutelage of Mr. 
Taylor and the feeling of the 
members of our class that we will 
be far and above our limited 
knowledge along this line of work, 
before the winter is through.
This impression has not been 
disappointing with regards to lec­
tures or laboratory work up to 
the present time, and from the 
vision I got of this department I 
feel that I am going to be on the 
receiving end at all times.
As most every young or middle- 
aged man knows, the steel indus­
try in this neck of the woods is 
about the largest field in which 
one has to seek his daily B and B, 
and as there are sc many phases 
to this great industry, I have tried 
to choose what I think is the 
youngest of the branches. Steel 
and Its Heat Treatment; --in my 
mind is a very necessary adjunct 
to the steel manufacturing plant 
—as we must know what our steel 
will do in the way of standing up 
under all conditions, and it is by 
this method we are able to tell 
the conditions, and it is by this 
method we are able to. tell the cus­
tomer what he must know when 
using steel on work which re­
quires special treating.
This article, if you choose to 
call it such, is written by one who 
has been, employed, by the Steel 
Corporation for the past 12 year* 
in office work. He has gone about 
as far as the’ office knowledge 
will permit, and is able to see that

Dressing?
A Night Student’s 
Opinion On Formals
Fashion Note: Long dresses no 
longer have oomph at Tech Night 
School dances. We girls, in case 
you hadn’t noticed, go in for the 
short and sweet type of thing. 
Grandmother could horse around 
at her minuets practically anchor­
ed to the floor, but that, kind of 
thing is too cumbersome for a 
modern, stream-lined dancer.
Midnight, too, is the hour we 
stop and long dresses are better 
off in the soft moonlight and stuff 
at 2:00 or possibly 4:00 A. M.
We dine at Sloppy Joe’s or Hi- 
land House or such like at 12:30 
and..why scare the waitress or'the 
boy behind the counter into'think­
ing your sleep walking or Joan 
Crawford slumming.
Don't be an unglamorous gran­
ny come like we do—short and 
sweet. ,
opportunity lies just over the 
bridge from Forbes Street, in 
Schenley Park, where knowledge 
can be had for almost the ask­
ing; and I say to any fellow, young 
or otherwise, who has the least 
idea of faltering in our class or 
any other class in C. I. T., to give 
himself another hitch, haul, down 
the “discourage” flag and go to it.
