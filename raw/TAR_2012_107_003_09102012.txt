Students living in Marga-
ret Morrison, Roselawn, and 
Woodlawn Apartments — the 
housing area known as the 
Intersection — are upset over 
an upheaval in their laundry 
service.
Intersection residents, who 
have until now done their 
laundry in the facilities on the 
?rst ?oor of the Margaret Mor-
rison Plaza, were moved to a 
room in the basement of Ham-
erschlag House on Aug. 31 to 
make way for a new dining 
location. Hamerschlag resi-
dents’ laundry facilities have 
been moved to a former stor-
age room in the main Hamer-
schlag building. Intersection 
residents’ key cards have been 
adjusted to allow them access 
to the Hamerschlag basement.
According to Director of 
Housing and Dining Services 
Director Kim Abel, the new 
dining location is one com-
ponent of a larger plan to 
renovate and update Carn-
egie Mellon dining, which also 
includes a patio addition to 
Resnik and a new façade for 
Margaret Morrison. Abel said 
that Housing and Dining Ser-
vices hopes to create a more 
communal space in Margaret 
Morrison, and that the laun-
dry room made the most sense 
to remove.
“The laundry was a ser-
vice that we believed that we 
could relocate and continue to 
provide similar, proximal ser-
vice,” Abel said. She believes 
that the new laundry accom-
modations are very similar to 
the old ones.
But many residents see the 
move as a sudden, unrequest-
ed, and unpleasant change. 
Among their concerns, they 
note that the Hamerschlag 
facility is farther away; that it 
contains fewer washing ma-
chines and dryers, not all of 
which currently work; that it 
is poorly lit and not well tem-
perature-controlled; and  that 
Hamerschlag residents can ac-
cess it through an emergency 
exit, which could be a safety 
concern. Above all, residents 
feel they were not properly 
consulted or warned about the 
change.
On Aug. 31, residents re-
ceived an email from Housing 
and Dining Facilities Director 
Louis McCauley that informed 
them that their laundry room 
was closed, and that they were 
now to do their laundry in a 
room in the basement of Ham-
erschlag. For some, such as ju-
nior creative writing and pro-
fessional writing double major 
Rachel Bullen of Roselawn, it 
was the ?rst of?cial con?rma-
tion they had heard about the 
change. Other residents heard 
about the change at R.A. meet-
ings during the ?rst week of 
school.

Several companies are 
rolling out a new strategy for 
marketing on campus this se-
mester: student ambassadors. 
Sony, Google, Microsoft, Red 
Bull, and possibly others all 
have student representatives 
on campus. These students 
are usually paid employees of 
the corporations and receive 
training, goods for demon-
stration or distribution, and 
support from other trained 
representatives in networks 
spread across campuses na-
tionwide.
Some student ambassa-
dors are tasked with organiz-
ing and executing promotion-
al events as well as acting as 
the heads of the local social 
media scene. These represen-
tatives can act as the spear-
head for marketing strategies 
and events.
Maddie Horowitz, a soph-
omore computer science ma-
jor, is a “Microsoft Student 
Partner.” Her ?rst task was to 
set up a Facebook group for 
people interested in Microsoft 
products on campus.
“Carnegie Mellon students 
are pretty interested in this 
sort of thing,” Horowitz said, 
noting that in a competition 
among a hundred Microsoft 
Student Partners to get the 
most likes for their campus 
Facebook pages, the one she 
started had an early lead 
compared to those at larger 
schools.
“The most common reac-
tion people have when they 
hear I’m a partner is, ‘Oh, 
does that mean you’re intern-
ing for them this summer?’ ” 
Horowitz said of the attitude 
toward ambassadors. “I think 
it’s a really good idea to hear 
this sort of info from a friend 
or other student instead of 
just a random person.”
Horowitz is involved in 
continual training with Mi-
crosoft products, and will 
soon be joined by another 
Student Partner on campus.
The representatives of 
Google on campus are junior 
electrical and chemical en-
gineering major Beth Anne 
Katz and senior computer 
science major Brenda Lee. As 
Google Ambassadors, they 
have similar tasks to Horow-
itz with competing products. 
Together, they both expressed 
enthusiasm for the Google 
corporate structure and some 
of the upcoming products 
they have been briefed on, in-
cluding a service that collects 
photos from events taken by 
different people.

This year, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Dining Services added 
?ve new venues and adjusted 
two existing venues. Creperie, 
Stackers, Nakama Express, 
Worlds of Flavor, and El Gallo 
de Oro are all new eateries. 
Evgefstos’ hours were also 
adjusted so that students 
could eat there between 5 
p.m. and 8 p.m., and Dining 
Services expanded the Schatz 
breakfast menu to include 
sandwiches.
Creperie is located in the 
UC Marketplace, between the 
existing Downtown Deli and 
Spinning Salads. At Crepe-
rie, students can select what 
ingredients and toppings go 
onto their crepe and then 
watch a chef make it. 
Both Stackers, a sandwich 
venue, and Nakama Express, 
a sushi venue, are located in 
the Resnik food court. Worlds 
of Flavor is in the Tartan Pavil-
ion and El Gallo de Oro is on 
the ?rst ?oor of the University 
Center, in the former location 
of Sí Señor.
“I think it’s good that 
there’s more variety and that 
they’re trying to keep things 
interesting every year,” said 
Erik Pintar, a sophomore elec-
trical and computer engineer-
ing major.
According to Kim Abel, the 
Director of Housing and Din-
ing Services, the decision to 
add these new eateries, and 
make some adjustments to 
existing ones, was made over 
the years and is a continuous 
process. She said there was 
no exact point in time when 
they came to the decision to 
speci?cally add the Creperie, 
Stackers, Worlds of Flavor, or 
Nakama Express.
“We are continuously try-
ing to improve our venue op-
tions,” Abel said.
“They’re probably going 
with the trends,” Lina Pul-
garin, ?rst-year physics ma-
jor, said of Creperie being 
added. “It’s kinda like going 
through a cupcake trend, cake 
trend, etc. Now they’re going 
through a crepe trend.”
According to Abel, Dining 
Services added these new op-
tions because of student feed-
back and trends. Venues like 
Creperie are a trend at other 
universities, and Dining Ser-
vices felt it would be a good 
addition to the campus.
Of Creperie, Pintar said, “I 
think the food is delicious but 
the portions are small.”
Other dining changes were 
made for different reasons. 
Abel said that Sí Señor was 
switched out for El Gallo de 
Oro in response to student 
feedback concerning Si Señor 
and students’ appreciation of 
Mexican food. Worlds of Fla-
vor, on the other hand, was 
added because of the positive 
response students gave to last 
year’s Take Comfort promo-
tion on Tuesday nights.
“Stackerz was actually 
something that one of the 
chefs came up with,” Abel 
said. “Students really get to 
choose what they want to eat. 
They can pick each ingredi-
ent.”
Nakama Express is the new 
sushi eatery in Resnik, located 
where Sushi Too used to exist.
“[Nakama Express] was 
good. They made me what I 
wanted. It was custom sushi,” 
Katy Wells, ?fth-year senior 
global studies major, said of 
the new sushi venue.

Lecture Preview
Last Thursday, it was an-
nounced that Justine Cassell 
will be of?cially appointed 
as the Charles M. Geschke 
Director of the Human-Com-
puter Interaction Institute 
(HCII).
The ceremony is set to 
take place on campus on 
Monday from 4 to 6 p.m. in 
the Asian Students Associa-
tion Conference Room (Gates 
Center 6115).
Cassell has served as HCII 
director since 2010, but the 
post as director has now been 
of?cially endowed by Adobe 
Systems, Inc. co-founder and 
Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. recipi-
ent Charles M. Geschke and 
his wife.
Cassell’s research looks 
into computer systems that 
utilize conversation and sto-
rytelling to enhance human 
communication skills and 
learning. In addition, Cassell 
has developed the Embodied 
Conversational Agent (ECA), 
which is capable of commu-
nicating with humans using 
both verbal and nonverbal in-
teraction. The ECA has been 
researched as a virtual peer 
for children, and autistic chil-
dren in particular.
Last January, Cassell 
spoke at the World Eco-
nomic Forum in Davos, and 
was awarded the Anita Borg 
Institute’s Women of Vision 
Award. She also chairs one of 
the World Economic Forum 
Global Agenda Councils.

Carnegie Mellon Provost 
Mark Kamlet will take part 
in a panel at the World 
Economic Forum (WEF) on 
Wednesday.
Though most WEF panels 
are closed to the public and 
press, this panel, “The Future 
of Education,” will be webcast 
live at 5:15 a.m. EST. Former 
U.K. Prime Minister Gordon 
Brown will also be on the 
panel, which will discuss the 
mobilization of information 
technology, interdisciplinary 
approaches, and the value of 
universities.
This is the second time 
Carnegie Mellon has been 
represented at the summer 
meeting of the WEF (known 
as “Summer Davos” in 
recognition of the fact that 
the winter WEF meeting 
traditionally occurs in Davos, 
Switzerland). 
In 2011, Carnegie Mellon 
faculty presented at both 
the summer and winter WEF 
meetings. This week, ?ve 
WEF panels, including “The 
Future of Education,” will 
contain presentations by 
Carnegie Mellon faculty or 
administrators. 
Among the panelists and 
presenters at the meeting are 
art professor Golan Levin; 
computer science professors 
Jeanette Wing amd Emma 
Brunskill; and Jesse Schell, 
an entertainment technology 
professor.
The theme of this week’s 
“Summer Davos” meeting, 
running this Tuesday through 
Thursday, is “Creating the 
Future Economy.”

Andrea Beschel, circulated a 
petition to stop the move, Mc-
Cauley attended a previously 
scheduled Margaret Morrison 
safety meeting to hear ques-
tions and concerns. 
Bullen and Beschel said 
they believe the meeting was 
in response to a large number 
of individual emails to Mc-
Cauley and Abel from Inter-
section residents protesting 
the change.
According to Bullen, Mc-
Cauley said during the meet-
ing that the maker of the 
laundry machines, Caldwell 
& Gregory, had “done the 
math,” and determined that 
one washing machine and 
dryer are necessary for every 
38 people.
“The meeting at Margaret 
Morrison was pretty much, 
‘We’re sorry we didn’t tell 
you, but this makes sense,’ ” 
Bullen said.
McCauley arranged for a 
meeting of himself, Abel, and 
a group of representatives 
from the Intersection this 
week to discuss options. Abel 
said that Housing and Dining 
is not committed to a plan, or 
to stopping the move, at this 
time.
“There are lots of options 
that we can look at,” Abel 
said. “I want to make sure that 
I hear the students’ feedback.”
Abel stressed that Hous-
ing and Dining is receptive to, 
and in fact actively seeks, stu-
dent input.
“We have always utilized 
student input in almost ev-
erything we do in Housing 
and Dining,” Abel said. “Some 
of it’s informal. Some of it’s 
through advisory groups. 
Some of it’s through our part-
nership with Student Senate.”
 Abel mentioned that the 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) and the Dining Ad-
visory Committee are the 
two major student advisory 
groups that Housing and Din-
ing consults.
But Beschel, who was also 
a resident of Roselawn last 
year, said that she doesn’t 
feel that the affected students 
were even warned of the 
changes, let alone consulted.
“A dining service is some-
thing that the community 
that’s being affected doesn’t 
need,” Beschel said. “We’re 
not freshmen, we’re mostly 
not on a meal plan, we have 
our own kitchens.” Beschel 
and Bullen both said that, al-
though some people do sup-
port the new dining location, 
most Intersection residents 
they’ve spoken to are opposed 
to the change. Their petition 
currently has 84 signatures 
out of about 140 Intersection 
residents.
According to Beschel and 
Bullen, an email was sent out 
to students last year advertis-
ing an open forum to discuss 
housing and dining changes, 
but the email only speci?cally 
mentioned the Resnik patio, 
not the possibility of a change 
in Intersection facilities.
Abel said that although 
Housing and Dining has been 
discussing the new dining 
location since last winter, it 
was unlikely that students 
were told about the upcoming 
change during room selec-
tion. “I don’t know, because 
the service is remaining the 
same, that that is something 
we would communicate,” she 
said.
“I’m really annoyed they 
didn’t talk to us,” Bullen said. 
“I just want to know where we 
go from here. I don’t think we 
should stick to the original 
plan.”
Beschel said that she feels 
that the lack of communica-
tion is unacceptable.
“We really do want to have 
a neighborhood here where 
our opinions are respected,” 
Beschel said. “We’re not here 
and gone, we’re here for four 
years, and we pay for that, 
and we deserve to be heard.”
Despite the protests, Abel 
said that she is excited about 
the new plan for Housing and 
Dining. “We’re doing some 
really neat things with the 
renovations and the plans. 
I’m hoping that we can move 
beyond this issue in a con-
structive way and get to the 
constructive part.”
The petition to stop the 
move can be found at https://
www.change.org/petitions/
stop-the-laundry-move. The 
primary contact of the SDC, 
which represents students’ 
housing concerns on campus, 
is the SDC president, junior 
information systems major 
Nathan Hahn. The SDC meets 
every Wednesday at 8 p.m. in 
Breed Hall. Meetings are open 
to Carnegie Mellon residents.
Editor’s note: Rachel Bullen is a 
Tartan staff member.
Hung out to dry, students say
Lee said that the most 
common reaction to her posi-
tion was “Get me a job!” Hav-
ing interned at Google, both 
Lee and Katz were quick to 
sign up for the Ambassador 
position, but stressed that it 
was a position any interested 
student should pursue.
However, not everyone is 
particularly enamored with 
these programs.
Recently, nontraditional 
marketing strategies — espe-
cially those that use people 
as the means of distribution 
— have aroused controversy. 
One of the most prominent in 
recent years was the “Home-
less Hotspots,” Wi-Fi connec-
tions provided by residents 
of a homeless shelter who 
received $20 a day and were 
told to distribute passwords 
to wireless transceivers they 
wore in exchange for tips.
This initiative, run by BBH 
Labs during the South By 
Southwest festival in Austin, 
Tx. this past March, was de-
nounced by many bloggers 
and members of traditional 
media, although the homeless 
individuals and a director of 
the shelter told The New York 
Times they weren’t bothered 
and had a hard time under-
standing the outcry.
This form of advertise-
ment is one with some unique 
challenges other than public 
perception. Google recently 
?red an employee who was 
promoting the new Chrome-
book in Best Buy after he 
posted pictures of his uni-
form, badge, and certi?cate of 
completed training on Reddit, 
along with some information 
about the product he would 
be working to sell, as docu-
mented by The Daily Dot. His 
actions were a breach of a 
nondisclosure agreement that 
was still in effect regarding 
his training and work. Google 
did not make an announce-
ment regarding the sale of 
Chromebooks in Best Buy.
Both Horowitz for Mi-
crosoft and Lee and Katz for 
Google said that their supe-
riors were reached mainly 
through online means: either 
conference calls to corporate 
headquarters (frequently at 
odd hours due to time zone 
differences) or emails. The 
organizational structures em-
ployed in the work do mean 
a lack of day-to-day oversight 
and high levels of implicit 
trust in the student represen-
tatives, and while Lee and 
Katz said they may be called 
upon to provide Google with 
information from time to 
time, gauging the ef?cacy of 
the program as a whole could 
prove challenging.
Student opinions on the 
advertising strategy are split. 
Some, like sophomore me-
chanical engineering ma-
jor Faith Quist, are put off. 
“Honestly, I think it’s kind of 
sleazy,” Quist said. “I don’t 
think it would bother me all 
that much but I wouldn’t do it 
myself.” 
Quist said, recalling her 
summer job selling homework 
aids to students, “I wouldn’t 
want to do anything like that 
again.”
Other students, how-
ever, took a somewhat more 
positive view. “These are just 
students doing a job,” Peter 
Masters, a sophomore inter-
national relations and envi-
ronmental policy major, said 
in reaction to such promo-
tional maneuvers, noting that 
student representatives are 
not nearly as controversial. 
“I know some people were 
bothered by the Red Bull girls 
at the activities fair... [but]
I don’t think it does any foul; 
it’s just a form of advertise-
ment.”

tional Science Board found 
that “most Americans do not 
understand the scienti?c pro-
cess and therefore may lack 
a valuable tool for assessing 
the validity of various claims 
they encounter in daily life.” 
With this as motivation, 
Pittsburgh will serve as the 
pilot city this fall for the Sci-
ence & Engineering Ambas-
sador Program, which aims 
to better connect scientists 
and engineers to the local 
community.
Implemented by the Na-
tional Academy of Science 
and National Academy of En-
gineering, the program con-
sists of a team of science and 
engineering ambassadors 
who will work “to improve the 
public understanding of and 
engagement with energy-re-
lated issues,” according to the 
program’s website.
The initial set of ambas-
sadors has already been se-
lected and is comprised of 
local scientists and engineers 
with areas of expertise related 
to the energy industry. These 
ambassadors come from both 
industry and nonpro?t orga-
nizations, and include pro-
fessors from the University of 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mel-
lon. In fact, four of the nine 
appointed ambassadors are 
af?liated with Carnegie Mel-
lon; this group includes engi-
neering and public policy pro-
fessors Jay Apt and Edward 
Rubin, chemical engineering 
professor Neil Donahue, and 
materials science and en-
gineering professor Robert 
Davis.
“People are disconnected, 
from an engineering perspec-
tive, from the very things that 
they hold dear,” Davis said. 
Davis acknowledged that 
there are existing challenges 
to connecting people with 
science, and in identifying 
problems such as lack of ac-
cess, knowledge, and interest 
in understanding the science 
and technology that drives so-
ciety today.
The program website ex-
plains that one of the reasons 
Pittsburgh was selected as a 
pilot city is due to the diversity 
of individuals and groups who 
are interested in the matter of 
energy. At least ?ve different 
energy sectors — including 
coal, gas, nuclear, solar, and 
wind — are represented in the 
region. The area also boasts 
a wealth of natural resources 
that continues to draw the 
interest of investors and re-
searchers alike.  
In addition to the consider-
able industry presence in the 
area, Pittsburgh is also home 
to universities with a number 
of researchers focusing their 
efforts on energy issues. It is 
this combination of relevant 
industrial and academic pres-
ence that has made Pitts-
burgh a top contender for the 
program.
Davis likened the structure 
and goals of the ambassador 
program to a scienti?c experi-
ment: The program will test 
whether increasing the visibil-
ity and availability of science 
and engineering experts will 
increase public engagement 
with scienti?c issues.
To bridge the gap, the 
program will provide training 
for the ambassadors in audio 
and visual communication 
with the intention of linking 
them with local profession-
als such as teachers, business 
leaders, or members of the 
media. 
Because the program is 
still in its infancy, there are 
still many unknowns about 
how to stimulate public inter-
est and concern with issues 
of science, but Davis offered 
this thought: “We’ll learn by 
doing. We’ll learn by trying, 
[to see] what — if anything — 
works. But not trying is even 
worse.”

Whether it was a day at the 
beach, working in the yard, or 
being lazy by the pool, your 
skin had been subjected to the 
damaging effects of the sun’s 
ultraviolet (UV) rays. Your re-
sult — either a painful burn or 
a healthy glow — probably de-
pended on the use of (or lack 
of) one indispensable item: 
sunscreen.
As its name suggests, sun-
screen protects you from the 
sun’s harmful UV rays — 
rays whose wavelengths are 
shorter than those of visible 
light. And while most of the 
sun’s rays are UV, our atmo-
sphere and ozone layer are 
able to ?lter out much of this 
damaging radiation.
The UV light that gets by, 
however, is harmful to the 
DNA in our skin; it results in 
a tan (yes, tans are signs of 
damage), burns, or even skin 
cancer with chronic expo-
sure. The three types of UV 
radiation are UV-A, UV-B, and 
UV-C, from longest to short-
est wavelength, respectively. 
Of the three, UV-B rays are 
the ones that cause sunburn, 
while UV-A can cause damage 
within the skin, contributing 
to skin cancer.
If the sun leaves you with 
a nasty burn, it’s a sign that 
the UV-B rays have damaged 
your skin cells. According to 
Discovery Health, skin cells 
that are the most susceptible 
to burn are those without any 
sort of melatonin — typically 
found in Caucasians without 
any sort of tan. When these 
cells get damaged, the body 
increases blood ?ow to the 
dermis, the second layer of 
skin, to bring in new cells that 
will repair the damage.
Sunscreen protects the 
skin from this invisible light 
through its unique chemical 
composition of inorganic and 
organic materials. The inor-
ganic particles, such as tita-
nium dioxide and zinc oxide, 
act as a sort of UV armor. The 
small particles sit on the skin 
and re?ect the wavelengths 
of UV-B light. But many old 
sunscreens, since they depend 
primarily on inorganic materi-
als, were thick and greasy.
Companies combat this 
issue with lighter, synthetic 
organic components that work 
by absorbing the UV light and 
then releasing the stored ener-
gy. According to a study by the 
University of Athens Medical 
School in Greece, these parti-
cles, such as octyl methoxycin-
namate, gain energy when ex-
posed to the UV rays and then 
release the energy through ei-
ther heat release or isomeriza-
tion — when a molecule rear-
ranges its atoms. Additionally, 
many of the newer sunscreens 
have tiny inorganic particles 
of about 45 nanometers in 
size. For comparison, a sheet 
of paper is roughly 100,000 
nanometers thick.
The SPF on sunscreens, 
or “Sun Protection Factor,” is 
meant to give an estimate for 
the rate of UV-B absorption, 
as well as the duration of how 
long the sunscreen is effective. 
To determine the effective 
duration of sun protection, 
simply multiply the SPF by 
10. For example, SPF 10 will 
grant roughly 100 minutes of 
protection. 
However, in terms of UV-B 
absorption, there is a ceiling 
to the SPF: With SPF 45 pro-
tecting from 98 percent of 
the sun’s UV-B rays, anything 
greater is “just silly,” James 
Spenser, the spokesman for 
the American Academy of 
Dermatology, told WebMD.
For optimal skin safety, 
use the entire recommended 
dose of sunscreen. It might 
seem that sunscreen manu-
facturers just want people to 
use more of their product, but 
in a recent article published 
in International Journal of 
Pharmaceuticals, researchers 
found that using less than the 
standard amount of sunscreen 
will increase the chances of 
getting burned.
It’s also important to re-
member that people can get 
burned during any season. 
Plenty of UV rays reach the 
ground any season of the year 
— not just summer. So when-
ever you’re planning on doing 
any activities out in the sun, 
remember to apply your in-
organic and organic particles 
liberally. You’ll save your skin, 
and possibly your life.

Carl Doersch, a doctoral 
student studying machine 
learning, and his colleagues 
have developed new graphi-
cal software capable of iden-
tifying stylistic features of 
cities. The team, composed of 
researchers from both Carn-
egie Mellon and the Institut 
National de Recherche en 
Informatique et en Automa-
tique, has published its work 
in the computer graphics 
journal ACM Transactions on 
Graphics.
The process of ?nding re-
lated patterns between im-
ages is known as visual data 
mining. Project collabora-
tor Alexei Efros, an associ-
ate professor of robotics and 
computer science at Carnegie 
Mellon, pointed out that the 
science is still relatively new.
“The ?eld of visual data 
mining is still in its infancy, 
but I believe it holds a lot of 
promise,” he said in a univer-
sity press release. “Our data 
mining technique was able to 
go through millions of [im-
ages] automatically — some-
thing that no human would 
be patient enough to do.”
The researchers’ full data 
set actually contained a quar-
ter of a billion images. They 
were collected from Google 
Street View.
The group’s program 
works by parsing through 
a given set of captured city 
imagery, identifying the el-
ements of that city’s archi-
tecture or scenery that may 
help distinguish it from other 
cities. Speci?cally, the algo-
rithm looks for representative 
features of a city — features 
that are both frequent, like 
trees, and speci?c, like Paris’ 
Eiffel Tower.
For example, the algo-
rithm labeled window bal-
ustrades, traditional street 
signs, distinct lampposts, 
balcony supports, and doors 
as some of the representa-
tive features of Paris. London, 
on the other hand, sports a 
combination of neoclassical 
columns, Victorian windows, 
and cast-iron fencing, all 
coming together to give each 
city a unique look.
But extracting these rare, 
indicative markers was no 
easy task. Doersch compared 
the process to that of ?nding 
needles in a haystack.
“It was quite a challenge 
to ?nd an algorithm that 
could reliably sift through all 
the uninteresting [images] 
without throwing out the 
needles,” he said.
Despite the challenges, the 
researchers had considerable 
success with their algorithm’s 
accuracy. European cities like 
Paris, London, Prague, Milan, 
and Barcelona — which have 
had distinctive architectural 
styles for centuries — proved 
especially responsive to the 
algorithm. However, there 
has been some dif?culty get-
ting it to work with cities in 
the U.S.
“When we tried our al-
gorithm on American cities, 
we found considerably less 
[features] than in European 
cities,” Doersch said. “Maybe 
this isn’t so surprising though, 
since the U.S. is in many ways 
a melting pot of cultures. Usu-
ally each city has so many dif-
ferent architectural in?uenc-
es that no single architectural 
style can dominate.”
The researchers presented 
their ?ndings at SIGGRAPH, 
an annual conference about 
advancements in computer 
graphics, earlier this month. 
“I spoke to quite a few people 
afterward who wanted to 
know more and were inter-
ested in taking it further,” Do-
ersch said.
One practical usage for 
the team’s research includes 
the potential for a computer-
assisted analysis of the spread 
of certain architectural styles 
across a given area. Doersch 
also highlighted another, 
perhaps more interesting, 
application.
“Computer animators of-
ten have to build models of 
cities,” he said. “For example, 
for the movie Ratatouille, Pix-
ar built a model of Paris.”
Doersch explained that to 
do this, the animators spent 
a few weeks in Paris carefully 
studying and taking pictures 
of the architecture in order 
to decide what to put in the 
façades to make them look 
Parisian.
“Our algorithm could help 
automate this process, pro-
viding a way to organize the 
collections of reference pho-
tos so that the animators can 
get a more complete picture 
of the city faster,” Doersch 
said.

Snails carry foreign eggs on their backs
Scientists recently found 
that a species of snails called 
solenosteira macrospira carry 
eggs that don’t belong to 
them on their backs. In most 
snail species, the female de-
posits the eggs into sand or 
attaches them to a rock after 
fertilization. However, female 
solenosteira macrospira attach 
their eggs onto their partners’ 
backs. Snails have several 
partners during their mating 
period, so these eggs often 
don’t belong to the snail they 
end up attached to. 
Suzanne Alonzo, an ecol-
ogy professor at Yale Univer-
sity, explained why a male 
snail would agree to this: “So 
as long as he mates with [a fe-
male] and sires a bunch of off-
spring, it doesn’t really matter 
if they’re on his back or some-
one else’s back.”

‘Junk’ DNA plays crucial role in body
Researchers at the Uni-
versity of California, Santa 
Cruz recently found out 
that parts of DNA previously 
considered to be useless are 
actually essential in making 
the body function properly. 
About 80 percent of what sci-
entists previously considered 
“junk” DNA acts as a switch 
for other parts of the DNA. 
Scientists previously thought 
only 5 to 10 percent of DNA 
was useful.
This “junk” controls which 
parts of the DNA will be ac-
tive and scientists have linked 
these gene switches to every-
thing from rheumatoid arthri-
tis to height. This discovery 
could provide certain cancer 
treatments by controlling the 
switches that might lead to 
cancer instead of attempting 
to control the disease itself.

Scientists teleport quantum states
A team of scientists in 
Vienna transmitted tiny 
pieces of information known 
as quantum states over 143 ki-
lometers using quantum tele-
portation. Scientists encoded 
this information into photons, 
and then transferred these 
photons between the Canary 
Islands of La Palma and 
Tenerife. The distance of 143 
kilometers was used as the 
milestone since it is the mini-
mum distance between the 
Earth and orbiting satellites. 
Scientists argue the tech-
nology is useful for applica-
tions in secure communi-
cation and that one of its 
advantages over other com-
munications technology is 
that it can theoretically work 
over any distance without 
taking additional time as dis-
tance increases.

Deep-sea crabs color-code food
Crabs that live a half-mile 
deep in the ocean may be us-
ing a novel way to protect 
themselves from toxic food. 
While these crabs don’t see 
sunlight, they are sensitive 
to blue and ultraviolet (UV) 
light. Duke University biolo-
gist Sönke Johnsen explained 
that the crabs use their sen-
sitivity to “sort out the likely 
toxic corals they’re sitting on, 
which glow, or bioluminesce, 
blue-green and green, from 
the plankton they eat, which 
glow blue.”
Certain crab species were 
found to have separate chan-
nels for processing blue and 
UV light, giving them a form 
of color vision they could use 
to pick out food. Next, the re-
searchers have to test these 
crabs in conditions closer to 
their natural habitat.

Voyager 1 will soon leave solar system
For a machine with only 68 
kilobytes of memory and an 
eight-track tape recorder, the 
Voyager 1 has accomplished a 
lot in its 35 years of explora-
tion. For the last few months, 
Voyager 1 has been exploring 
a turbulent and hot plasma 
bubble at the edge of the so-
lar system. Once the satellite 
leaves the outer edge, it is ex-
pected to encounter a much 
calmer climate. 
Scientists have recently 
seen new data coming in 
from the spacecraft, which 
originally departed Earth in 
1977, that shows the space-
craft is at the edge of crossing 
over. Given that the Voyager 
1 has enough fuel to last until 
2020, there should be plenty 
of time for scientists to get in-
formation about stars they’ve 
never had access to before.

Exploding stars may affect climate
The temperature on Earth 
could be affected in part by 
forces beyond human con-
trol, like how often stars ex-
plode. “When a star explodes, 
a massive amount of cosmic 
rays enter the atmosphere af-
fecting the weather in space 
by making it cloudier. More 
clouds in space leads to the 
Earth’s atmosphere, being 
cooler,” astrophysicist Charles 
Wang of Scotland’s University 
of Aberdeen said. Hence, the 
more stars that explode in a 
year, the cooler the Earth’s 
temperature will be, accord-
ing to Wang. On average, one 
stars explodes in every galaxy 
every year, releasing a huge 
amount of energy and cosmic 
rays.

Students will no longer have to 
battle over the coveted free-parking 
spots on Margaret Morrison Street; 
at the start of the semester, meters 
were erected on the street, ready 
to eat up students’ quarters. At any 
other university, this might not be a 
big deal. But here, where parking is 
not only scarce but also expensive, 
taking away a conveniently located 
street of free parking is another 
strain on students.
With this street gone, students 
who live on campus and want to 
have a car are left with limited op-
tions. There’s parking on campus, 
which is convenient but also incred-
ibly expensive. The East Campus Ga-
rage, for example, will cost $114.50 
per month — or $1,145 for the 10 
months classes are in session. And 
the garage isn’t even the most expen-
sive parking lot on campus.
“We continue to make every ef-
fort to keep parking rates reason-
able, especially during these eco-
nomic times,” Michelle Porter, the 
director of Parking & Transportation 
Services, said in an announcement 
last year. And yet, the rates for the 
2012–13 academic year increased 
about 3 percent, and they will in all 
likelihood continue to increase year 
after year.
Space is also a major issue, since 
parking areas are limited on campus. 
“Demand for parking is expected to 
be very high, and we anticipate that 
our lots will be at capacity during the 
2012–2013 parking year; therefore, 
we suggest that you select multiple 
preferences,” Porter further said in 
the announcement. This year, for 
Doherty Apartment’s parking, there 
was so much demand that there was 
a waitlist for spots.
Moreover, students can only ap-
ply for a permit spot during a certain 
period, between April 23 and May 4. 
As a result, they have to know far in 
advance if they will be bringing a car 
to campus, further complicating the 
process for students.
Compare this to an annual City 
of Pittsburgh parking permit, which 
costs about $20. With a city permit, 
residents are allowed to park on mul-
tiple streets in the area surrounding 
their address rather than having to 
choose a parking spot on availability.
However, students living on cam-
pus can’t apply for a City of Pitts-
burgh permit since they have a cam-
pus address. 
This leaves them to decide be-
tween forgoing a car and depending 
on the PAT bus system or dealing 
with the stress and costs of having a 
car on campus.
The addition of meters to Marga-
ret Morrison Street may seem like a 
minor inconvenience to some, but to 
many students who already face ex-
pensive and limited parking options, 
it is a severe blow.
People don’t read license agree-
ments — otherwise known as those 
“Terms and Conditions” boxes — 
when they buy things online. Why? 
Because they are extremely long and 
mundane, and the consumer usually 
makes assumptions about the license 
that are generally correct. When it 
comes to purchasing digital music, 
most consumers assume that what-
ever they buy, whether they receive 
it in a tangible form or keep it as a 
digital resource, is theirs to own. 
Therefore, the vast majority of on-
line shoppers ?nd it unnecessary to 
scale the dense walls of text in online 
license agreements.
However, digital ownership is 
not always the result of an online 
purchase, especially when it comes 
to music. This was showcased last 
week, when rumors spread that ac-
tor Bruce Willis planned to sue Apple 
after ?nding out he was unable to le-
gally pass down his iTunes collection 
to his daughters — because, techni-
cally, he does not own his iTunes col-
lection. Songs bought from iTunes 
are personally licensed to the buyer, 
but they are not “owned.”
To clear up some of this confusion 
— and avoid expensive legal battles 
— online agencies should make very 
clear what one can or cannot do with 
an online product by reforming how 
license agreements are conveyed to 
users.
Digital licensing is an extremely 
unclear matter, especially for con-
sumers; it takes real effort for some-
one to ?nd out what they can or 
cannot do with something bought 
online. 
Although it’s true that the buyer 
could perform extensive research 
into the restrictions on his or her 
purchase, it would be much more ef-
fective for online agencies to make 
those “Terms and Conditions” boxes 
a little easier on the eyes through 
better visual design and layout of the 
license agreements.
As they exist right now, online 
license agreements are irritating 
obstructions that consumers skip 
over in a matter of seconds. In or-
der to make sure buyers know what 
they can or cannot do with their 
purchases, companies need to en-
sure that their license agreements 
are readable, clear, and concise. 
They need to be designed, not only 
by lawyers invested in protecting 
the company, but by writers who can 
communicate such ideas clearly to 
the general public.
License agreements for digital media need revision
Additional parking meters on campus strain students
NYC program shouldn’t restrict mothers from formula
New York Mayor Michael Bloom-
berg’s “Latch On NYC” movement 
has put baby formula behind lock 
and key. About two-thirds of New 
York’s hospitals are participating 
in the movement, which restricts 
new mothers’ access to formula. Al-
though it won’t be denied to women 
with newborns, they will now have 
to speci?cally ask for formula and go 
through a lecture on the health ben-
e?ts of breast milk each time they 
need it.
It’s true that breast milk is bet-
ter for newborns than baby for-
mula. WomensHealth.gov, a site 
by the U.S. Department of Health 
and Human Services, cites how ba-
bies raised on breast milk are less 
susceptible to asthma, obesity, and 
Type 2 diabetes than those raised on 
formula. But these new restrictions 
Bloomberg has put on new mothers’ 
access to formula don’t take reality 
into account.
The reality of the situation is that 
not all women have the time or en-
ergy to breastfeed or the money to 
buy expensive equipment for breast-
feeding. Breast pumps can cost up to 
$400, equipment that isn’t always 
covered by health insurance. 
What’s more, a campaign of this 
type has the potential to create a 
social stigma around baby formula. 
Messages that support breastfeed-
ing as the only way to nourish your 
newborn can easily be translated 
into “If you’re a good mother, you’ll 
breastfeed,” or “only mothers who 
can’t properly care for their child use 
formula.” These messages are rein-
forced by the fact that a mother has 
to sign for a bottle of formula, like 
she’s buying a controlled and pre-
scribed drug.
Instead of restricting formula, 
Bloomberg should make it easier for 
women to breastfeed; working on 
changing the public’s perception of 
the practice. Why not make restau-
rants and workplaces more breast-
feeding friendly? Or subsidize breast 
pumps and other lactation devices? 
Measures to encourage breastfeed-
ing are more ethical and considerate 
of new mothers than limiting their 
options.
Restrictions like those instituted 
by “Latch On NYC” fail to take the 
pressures of reality and circumstance 
into consideration. There are bet-
ter ways to encourage breastfeeding 
than making the process of getting 
formula that much harder for new 
mothers.

Friday’s job numbers from the 
Bureau of Labor Statistics are just 
another one of the many painful re-
minders of the recent economic col-
lapse and ensuing recession.
In the month of August, three 
times as many workers left the job 
market as found jobs. There was no 
wage growth and the vast majority 
of jobs gained were low-paying, and 
most were jobs serving alcoholic 
drinks, indicating a trend towards 
escapism. This is the fourth month 
in a row of dismal jobs numbers that 
on the surface seem hopeful (the 
unemployment rate fell from 8.3 
percent to 8.1 percent), but are dis-
couraging when you look into them.
This begs the question: Why is 
the economy still so bad?
Our president is very fond of 
saying that Republican presidential 
candidate Mitt Romney and the Re-
publicans want to “take us back to 
the policies that got us in the mess 
in the ?rst place.” What typically fol-
lows is empty rhetoric about letting 
Wall Street write its own rules and 
cutting taxes for the 1 percent. That 
all sounds great, but that’s actually 
not what got us here.
Everyone has heard the nar-
rative before. A bunch of people 
bought houses and got mortgages. 
The banks then gambled with these 
mortgages, packaged them up, and 
invested on them in a very risky 
way. When some people defaulted 
on these mortgages, the whole thing 
went south, some banks failed, more 
people defaulted on their mortgages 
due to the economy, companies laid 
employees off, the ailing auto indus-
try was hit by a lack of demand, and 
the whole economy cascaded into 
stagnation.
The second half of the previous 
paragraph is pretty much true. Once 
the initial shocks hit, everything 
imploded and a lot of weak sectors 
and companies were shaken up. But 
I don’t buy the supposed root cause: 
greedy Wall Street investment bank-
ers took risky investments on the 
backs of hardworking Americans.
I’m not really a fan of Wall Street 
so I’m not about to defend it, but the 
housing market has been the surest 
bet in the American economy since 
the ’50s. Home values have always 
consistently increased, according to 
U.S. Census data, and people typi-
cally try to pay their mortgages be-
cause they need a place to live. Re-
alistically, these investments weren’t 
as risky as they’re made out to be.
The real cause of the recession 
lies in people living beyond their 
means.
Government programs such as 
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac made 
it easy for low-income people to get 
low interest loans, whether they 
were quali?ed for them or not. 
They were all about helping people 
become homeowners. There’s no 
deeper-rooted American value than 
property ownership, and these pro-
grams re?ected the great intention 
to give everyone a shot at owning a 
home. 
They did this by creating a sec-
ondary mortgage market for mort-
gage-backed securities which would 
then increase the attractiveness of 
mortgages for banks to incentivize 
lending to low-income or even no-
income people.
Realistically, however, some 
people just weren’t good candidates 
to take on the debt and responsibil-
ity that comes with owning a home 
and ?nancing a mortgage. They shot 
too far when they weren’t ready 
and came up short. They defaulted 
on their mortgages en masse and 
started the vicious cycle that got us 
where we are today.
Romney and the Republicans 
want to rectify the problem of living 
beyond our means. Entitlement re-
form is crucial to this goal. If we stay 
on this course of borrowing 40 cents 
of every dollar we spend, according 
to North Dakota Democratic Senator 
Kent Conrad, we will eventually de-
fault on our debt.
We need to practice budget aus-
terity, otherwise the entire U.S. 
economy will follow the trajectory 
of the housing market with conse-
quences to scale.

LETTER TO THE EDITORDorm laundry situation raises student concerns
As a member of the Intersection 
collection of dormitories on cam-
pus, I am writing to air grievances 
regarding recent changes made to 
the housing situation there by Hous-
ing and Dining. In previous years, 
the Intersection was served by a col-
lection of laundry machines located 
in Margaret Morrison Plaza. Upon 
arrival to Carnegie Mellon this se-
mester, students of the Intersection 
discovered their laundry room had 
been abruptly closed and they had 
been permanently redirected to a 
laundry room in the basement of 
Hamerschlag.
Concerns about this change have 
not been answered by Housing and 
Dining with more than perfunctory 
brush-offs, so I am seeking a wider 
audience. Our complaints fall into 
two major categories. The ?rst is 
purely logistical; the new laundry 
location is farther, with fewer wash-
ers that are in worse condition, 
meaning that the Intersection’s ac-
cess to laundry has been more than 
halved. Rubbing salt into the wound 
is the fact that multiple machines in 
the Hamerschlag laundry room sim-
ply do not function at all. This situa-
tion is highly frustrating, especially 
since it is a permanent change that 
residents of the Intersection have no 
recourse from.
In addition, students were not 
informed of this decision until af-
ter the school year began, despite 
it being planned as far back as 
before housing selection for the 
2012–13 school year. Students in 
the Intersection were given no op-
portunity to respond to this change, 
and signed their housing agree-
ment with one understanding only 
to ?nd their housing situation was 
substantially different when they 
arrived. It is inappropriate and un-
reasonable for such a decision to be 
foisted on students so abruptly and 
underhandedly.
The students of the Intersection 
do not accept this situation. We are 
upset that our access to laundry ma-
chines has been abruptly reduced 
and disconcerted that we were en-
tirely cut out of the decision-making 
process, and above all, we want 
Housing and Dining to acknowledge 
we have a legitimate grievance and 
to take steps to address it.
Thomas Wright 
SCS, Class of 2013
We hope you’ve been having a 
good ?rst few weeks back on cam-
pus! 
We wanted to use this letter to 
update you on the progress of some 
of our initiatives thus far into the se-
mester and give you a road map of 
what Student Government Exec has 
planned for the upcoming year.
We have been working hard to 
start off the year with a strong PR 
presence for student government 
— PR has been and continues to be 
one of our primary objectives for the 
year, and we began working during 
Orientation week by registering vot-
ers at meal times. 
We were able to both register a 
signi?cant amount of ?rst-years and 
connect with our new constituents. 
Over the summer we brought togeth-
er the Board of Directors to create 
the programming for the “Welcome 
Back Weekend” and offer a chance 
for the entire campus to come to-
gether at the start of the year. We are 
now focused on hitting the ground 
running on many of our initiatives 
outlined in our platform.
We plan on expanding our voter 
registration efforts throughout the 
semester, and as we near Election 
Day, we will be providing resources 
for absentee voting, pro?les on lo-
cal candidates, and ideally hosting 
debate and election result watch 
parties. 
We generated a lot of buzz in our 
campaign about our ?rst town hall 
meeting — we are still hammering 
down a date, but it will be the week 
of Sept. 17, and we will be giving out 
Chipotle to attendees. This town hall 
will be used to collect feedback on a 
number of issues, including possible 
changes to the student activities fee.
We are in the process of schedul-
ing meetings with various admin-
istrators of campus services to see 
what they are looking for from stu-
dent government, as well as advocat-
ing on various issues such as Shuttle 
and Escort based on feedback from 
the last issue of The Tartan.
To make it easier to track our prog-
ress, we are very close to launching 
our of?cial blog on cmu.edu/stugov, 
where we will push weekly updates 
on our various initiatives. 
We also want to acknowledge 
that there are some initiatives that 
we are not as far along with as we 
would have hoped. For instance, we 
were unable to get the group event 
attendance competition up and run-
ning for the start of the semester, but 
we will continue to work on this and 
hope to get the logistics worked out 
soon.
Our main goal is to maintain 
open communication with the Carn-
egie Mellon community so you can 
know how we are working to help 
you. We are open to criticism and 
collaboration throughout the se-
mester, and you can always email us 
at sbp@andrew.cmu.edu. Addition-
ally, you can attend our of?ce hours, 
which are posted at cmu.edu/stugov. 
If you see us around, stop and say 
hi and let us know how we can best 
serve you.

Kids in mascara, pregnant teenag-
ers, obesity, extra thumbs, and way 
too much roadkill — it has ?nally 
happened. A monstrous chunk of 
America’s ridiculous societal upsets 
have made it to the limelight in TLC’s 
reality comedy show Here Comes 
Honey Boo Boo.
This spin-off from reality show 
Toddlers and Tiaras stars the hillbilly 
pageant queen Alana Thompson, 
her mom June “the coupon queen,” 
Glitzy the pet pig, and the rest of 
their uncensored, unconventional 
family. 
The show follows Alana’s beauty-
pageant struggles and various sub-
plots involving her sisters — nick-
named Chickadee, Chubbs, and 
Pumpkin — and her father Mike, 
a.k.a. Sugar Bear.
The show is wildly compelling; 
it’s crude, honest, and most impor-
tantly, hysterical. It’s like every other 
tabloid-endorsed reality show, ex-
cept it’s missing the trust funds, the 
Jersey nightclubs, and the seven 
strangers picked to live in one house. 
The similarities, however, lie in the 
array of overstrung off-screen scan-
dals that, in recent weeks, have cir-
cled Honey Boo Boo and her clan.
The most infamous controver-
sy surrounds photos that feature 
Pumpkin, Alana’s twelve-year-old 
sister, feeding Kaitlyn, Chickadee’s 
newborn daughter, Mountain Dew-
dipped paci?ers. 
Soda is unhealthy at any age, 
and it is widely agreed that giving it 
to a one-month-old is going too far. 
Feeding infants soda may result in 
obesity, diabetes, cavities, and other 
nutritional de?ciencies. This was 
probably not Pumpkin’s best move, 
but in her defense, maybe it was the 
best they could do. It’s not healthy, 
but it’s their normal. Coming from a 
family that feasts on roadkill, I don’t 
?nd it so weird.
This, however, has itched the feet 
of mothers and nutritionists alike. 
But I haven’t even gotten to the best 
— and juiciest — part of this story.
Kaitlyn has an extra thumb. And 
the most “scandalous” part of Kai-
tlyn’s extra limb? Mama June has 
been accused of making fun of it. 
Imagine the claimed awfulness of 
this: A thirty-two year old grand-
mother having the nerve to tease her 
infant granddaughter for her birth 
defect. 
Critics argue that while it was 
unfortunate enough for Kaitlyn to 
suffer from this defect, she should 
at least have support from her fam-
ily. In an interview with People, June 
retracted her negative approach, 
claiming, “We have embraced [the 
abnormality]. It makes Kaitlyn more 
special to us.”
The show may be backward, but 
the criticism is even more so. Even 
though it is entertainment, the show 
is still real. These people are real. 
They live this lifestyle that people 
condemn, criticize and try to ?x, but 
it’s still their lives. These controver-
sies are bizarre, but that does not 
make them scandals.
The Mountain Dew and extra 
thumb issues aren’t even the half of 
it. 
Critics are in uproar over the fact 
that each of June’s children have dif-
ferent fathers. They are furious that 
ratings exceeded those of the Repub-
lican National Convention for some 
demographics. They swarmed over a 
wardrobe malfunction. 
The criticism is coming from ev-
ery direction, and at the root of it is 
the lack of approval over the family’s 
lifestyle.
It’s just their way of living, and 
that does not stop me or the other 
three million viewers from reveling 
in it. Honey Boo Boo has come, and 
she is certainly not wavering out of 
the spotlight. The real question is 
this: Will their lifestyle stop you from 
watching?
Critics of Honey Boo Boo too harsh
LUKE MASA
Junior Staffwriter
At the end of these past two 
weeks, it is quite likely that those of 
us following the conventions closely 
— even in sound bites — might feel 
somewhat fatigued. From Repub-
lican presidential candidate Mitt 
Romney to his wife Ann to First Lady 
Michelle Obama, and everybody in 
between, it’s been speeches back to 
back.
Yet last Wednesday at the Demo-
cratic National Convention, before 
the commander in chief got his say, 
one of his predecessors took the 
stage for what was the best case for 
Barack Obama I’ve heard the Demo-
crats deliver.
Former president Bill Clinton 
came out as what appeared to be the 
Democrats’ unlikely trump card, be-
cause despite his rhetorical and po-
litical prowess, he is now more well 
known for his admittedly ill-advised 
cigar shenanigans than for what 
he actually accomplished while in 
of?ce. 
However, his speech was every-
thing the Republican National Con-
vention speeches weren’t in that it 
actually laid out plans, accomplish-
ments, and details.
It spent more time presenting 
what one side got right than what 
the other got wrong; that is why I 
believe it did more for the president 
than practically any other effort in 
the past four years. In spite of his 
somewhat sordid reputation, Clin-
ton laid out a strong foundational 
case for the Democrats by reminding 
us all of a little thing he calls “arith-
metic” — sheer numerical facts.
His bottom line? In the past 51 
years, Democrats created 42 million 
jobs while in of?ce and Republicans 
created just 24 million, less than half 
that amount, a statement that fact-
checking website PolitiFact.com 
veri?ed as true.
Such numbers, while the crux of 
Clinton’s argument, weren’t the only 
things he stressed. He made sure to 
give credit were credit is due, even 
to former president George W. Bush 
for his support of PEPFAR, the gov-
ernment’s AIDS relief program, a 
mention conspicuously absent from 
this year’s RNC. But Clinton also re-
minded us of all the qualities that 
make Obama the preferable choice.
He stressed Obama’s attempts at 
cooperation within and without the 
party, from cabinet appointments, 
such as Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton, to the new jobs plan that 
was rejected by Congress. Clinton 
also included the actions taken by 
Obama early in his presidency, such 
as the then-unpopular (but now 
seemingly vindicated) stimulus plan 
and automobile bailout. 
Clinton played up what is argu-
ably Obama’s biggest accomplish-
ment in healthcare reform, and 
noted the other side’s plans to get 
rid of it.
And in his ?nal remarks, Clinton 
struck a chord with the audience, 
summarizing why those concerned 
with changing voter policies, immi-
gration, or the middle class should 
re-elect Obama. Clinton’s line of the 
night might have been: “We cannot 
afford to double-down on trickle-
down.” 
Thus, he was able to convince 
me that whether you go just by the 
numbers or are simply looking for a 
moderate willing to reach across the 
aisle, Obama is who you should vote 
for come November.
Clinton’s speech does wonders for president

SPORTS COMMENTARYMLB Wild Card a tight race
ADAM GRUBER
Sports Co-Editor
I am insurmountably 
thankful for Major League 
Baseball’s new Wild Card 
one-game playoff; this Na-
tional League Wild Card race 
would not be a story without 
it. The Atlanta Braves are sit-
ting pretty — three-and-a-
half games up on the ?eld — 
and without any of the other 
teams making a strong push, 
that lead should feel comfort-
able.
But the sought-after sec-
ond spot in the Wild Card race 
gives a team the chance to 
play the Braves in a one-game 
playoff — a rule instituted by 
Major League Baseball before 
the start of the season. That 
spot is separated by just one-
and-a-half games, with the 
St. Louis Cardinals above the 
Los Angeles Dodgers and the 
Pittsburgh Pirates.
A long-awaited playoff 
berth for the city of Pittsburgh 
might signal the apocalypse: 
The last time the Pirates made 
the playoffs, or even ?nished 
a regular season with a re-
cord above .500, was in 1992. 
This season, behind the bat of 
MVP candidate and out?elder 
Andrew McCutchen and with 
some surprisingly solid pitch-
ing led by ace A.J. Burnett, 
the Pirates have put them-
selves in a spot to break their 
horrid streak.
But outside of McCutchen, 
the offense has been shallow 
all season. Third baseman Pe-
dro Alvarez exhibited strokes 
of power with 27 home runs, 
but does not consistently get 
on base. His “success” this 
season has been a treat to 
fans, but under the gaze of 
unbiased eyes, his numbers 
are still average at best. 
Out?elder Garrett Jones, 
newly acquired ?rst baseman 
Gaby Sanchez, and second 
baseman Neil Walker have 
been solid at the plate this 
season, posting .280-plus bat-
ting averages. But a look at 
how this team has performed 
offensively shows a below-
average offense: 23rd in runs 
scored and 21st in batting av-
erage.
It has been the Pirates’ 
pitching that has carried 
them into the playoff race this 
season. The team is ninth in 
the majors in earned run aver-
age (ERA), 11th in wins plus 
hits times innings pitched 
(WHIP), and seventh in bat-
ting average allowed (BAA). 
I’ve already mentioned Bur-
nett, but the Pirates have also 
seen great play from start-
ing pitcher James MacDon-
ald and closing pitcher Joel 
Hanrahan. If the Pirates have 
a lead in the ninth, Hanrahan 
has been a model of consis-
tency closing out games and 
securing victories.
The Dodgers, however, 
are an enigma as far as I’m 
concerned. The Dodgers’ 
new ownership, headed by 
Earvin “Magic” Johnson, 
has made drastic strides to 
stack the offense, adding 
the likes of in?elder Hanley 
Ramirez, out?elder Shane 
Victorino, and ?rst baseman 
Adrian Gonzalez to a lineup 
already headed by all-star  
out?elders Matt Kemp and 
Andre Ethier. These moves 
have shown the depth of the 
owners’ pockets and their 
willingness to spend to make 
the team better.
Despite the talent the 
Dodgers brought in to beef up 
their offense, the bats have 
been average. The Dodgers 
are posting the 18th-best bat-
ting average and 18th-best 
slugging percentage, and 
have scored the 24th-most 
runs in the Major Leagues. 
Like the Pirates, the Dodgers’ 
pitching has been surprisingly 
good.
On paper, the Dodgers’ 
pitching staff is not anything 
to fear. Other than 2011 Cy 
Young Award winner Clayton 
Kershaw, the starting pitch-
ing staff does not seem deep. 
Behind Kershaw, the Dodgers 
boast Chris Capuano, Aaron 
Harang, Joe Blanton, and 
Josh Beckett. There was a 
time when Beckett, Capuano, 
and Harang were elite pitch-
ers in the league, but Capua-
no and Harang are past their 
prime and Beckett has been a 
head case.
Dodgers starting pitchers 
Chad Billingsley and Ted Lilly 
also went down with season-
ending injuries.
Despite this, the Dodg-
ers’ pitching is ?fth in ERA, 
second in quality starts, and 
third in BAA. When healthy, 
closer Kenley Jensen has ex-
hibited how dominant his 
pitches are, boasting a 2.54 
ERA and converting on 25 of 
31 save opportunities.
But as I see it, the Cardinals 
will ?nish in that second spot 
to play the Braves in the one-
game wild card playoff. The 
reigning World Series cham-
pions have a deeper pitching 
staff and offense than anyone 
else in the race.
Their offense is among the 
best in baseball, led by out-
?elders Matt Holiday and Car-
los Beltran and catcher Yadier 
Molina. These guys have led 
the Cardinals to second in 
runs scored, third in batting 
average, and second in on-
base percentage.
The Cards’ pitching staff 
has been solid as well, headed 
by Kyle Lohse and Adam 
Wainwright, posting the 10th-
best ERA and the sixth-most 
quality starts in the MLB. 
This race is a tight one and 
should be exciting to the very 
end of the regular season, 
but I don’t see the Cardinals, 
with their World Series expe-
rience, giving up the lead in 
this race.

The Carnegie Mellon Tar-
tans defeated the Allegheny 
College Gators 37–7 last Sat-
urday. With the win, the Tar-
tans start the season 2–0.
Carnegie Mellon quickly 
took the lead after a 55-yard, 
eight-play drive that ended 
with a 27-yard ?eld goal 
from ?rst-year kicker Connor 
Young. After being down 3–0, 
the Gators responded with a 
77-yard drive that ended with 
a one-yard touchdown run. 
After that score, Carnegie 
Mellon took control of the 
ball game and reeled off 34 
unanswered points.
The scoring frenzy be-
gan with a nine-yard sprint 
into the end zone by senior 
running back Patrick Blanks 
with 12:18 remaining in the 
second quarter.
Junior wide receiver Tim 
Kikta followed him into the 
end zone with a 39-yard 
touchdown catch from junior 
quarterback Rob Kalkstein 
to make it 17–7 going into 
halftime.
Kikta and Kalkstein did not 
waste any time increasing the 
lead on the ?rst play of the 
Tartan’s second possession of 
the second half with an 82-
yard touchdown. The score 
was 23–7 after Young missed 
the point-after attempt, kick-
ing it wide right. 
Blanks followed suit with 
his second and third trips to 
the end zone to put the game 
out of reach at 37–7. He ended 
the game with 52 yards on 14 
carries and three touchdowns.
Overall, the Tartans had 
461 yards of total offense with 
261 coming through the run-
ning game. Kalkstein ended 
the game with two touch-
downs and a career-high 200 
passing yards.
Defensively, Carnegie Mel-
lon excelled, holding the Ga-
tors to only 207 yards of total 
offense on the day.
Junior safety Jack Butler 
and junior linebacker Akwasi 
Brefo led the way, each with 
eight tackles.
“We lost to that team three 
years in a row. The win yes-
terday really shows the char-
acter of this team. It’s great 
to see the team progressing 
week to week. Hopefully we 
carry this momentum into 
our next game....” Blanks 
said.
Carnegie Mellon plays 
next Friday at Gesling Sta-
dium, hosting the Catholic 
University Cardinals. Kickoff 
is set for 7 p.m.

Pennsylvania college foot-
ball was shaken up during the 
past year as both the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh and Penn-
sylvania State University went 
through major changes.
Pitt announced that it was 
leaving the Big East Confer-
ence to go with Syracuse Uni-
versity to the Atlantic Coast 
Conference (ACC) starting 
next season, following in the 
footsteps of former Big East-
turned-ACC schools Virginia 
Tech University, Miami Uni-
versity, and Boston College.
Pitt also has a new head 
coach, Paul Chryst, as Todd 
Graham left after only one sea-
son to become the head coach 
at Arizona State University. 
Penn State has been deal-
ing with the fallout from the 
Jerry Sandusky scandal, with 
longtime coach and face of 
the team Joe Paterno being 
dismissed and soon thereafter 
passing away from lung can-
cer.
New head coach Bill 
O’Brien has had to deal with 
harsh sanctions and player 
transfers as he tries to restore 
the Nittany Lions to their for-
mer glory. Unfortunately, both 
?rst-time head coaches have 
had poor starts to their ten-
ures, as Pitt and Penn State 
have started the year 0–2.
Pitt football has been a 
shell of its former glory in re-
cent years, going 7–5 and 6–6 
the past two seasons. Even in 
the Big East, Pitt has had a 
hard time living up to expecta-
tions, and this year seems to 
be no different. The Panthers 
started off the year by getting 
upset 31–17 by the football 
championship school (former-
ly Division 1-AA), Youngstown 
State University.
Pitt’s schedule did not get 
any easier as they faced Cin-
cinnati last Thursday in their 
annual Ohio River rivalry 
game. The Panthers wasted no 
time falling behind, giving up 
a 58-yard touchdown run on 
the ?rst play of the game.
After their rough start, 
things only got worse, and 
Cincinnati eventually won 34–
10. Pitt continued its struggles 
on both sides of the ball, as 
quarterback Tino Sunseri was 
sacked six times, threw one 
touchdown, and had one fum-
ble while the defense gave up 
464 yards and 19 ?rst downs.
Meanwhile, Penn State’s 
season is one of change and 
turnover.
Along with a new head 
coach, the Nittany Lions also 
changed their uniforms by 
adding players’ names to the 
backs of the jerseys and blue 
ribbons to the back of the hel-
mets as a symbol of support for 
victims of child sexual abuse.
However, these cosmetic 
changes did nothing to im-
prove their playing, as the 
Nittany Lions let an 11-point 
halftime advantage slip away 
against Ohio and lost 24–14.
The on-?eld struggles did 
not go away as Penn State lost 
to Virginia Tech 17–16, follow-
ing four missed ?eld goals by 
kicker Sam Ficken.
The Nittany Lions’ defense 
looked in top form for most 
of the game, causing four 
turnovers, but the offense 
struggled and converted those 
chances into only three points.
Unfortunately, even the de-
fense collapsed in crunch time 
as they gave up the winning 
86-yard drive.
The mass exodus of play-
ers following the NCAA sanc-
tions on Penn State football 
— including two key transfers, 
running back Silas Redd and 
kicker Anthony Fera — would 
have likely turned this heart-
breaking loss into an easy win 
for the Nittany Lions.
Overall, the next few years 
are going to be rough for Penn-
sylvania college football fans. 
Pitt is trying to rede?ne 
itself with a new conference 
next season and is on its third 
head coach in as many years.
The ACC will offer stiffer 
competition for the Panthers, 
but will hopefully offer a larg-
er national spotlight and allow 
Pitt to increase its recruiting 
base and regain its former 
glory. 
For Penn State, the road is 
not quite so easy. With a four-
year bowl ban imposed as part 
of NCAA sanctions from the 
Sandusky scandal, the Nittany 
Lions will have trouble attract-
ing top recruits with NFL aspi-
rations.
There is hope, however, 
since many current players 
have chosen to stay with the 
team rather than transfer 
without penalty. Also, many 
recruits have kept their com-
mitments.
Penn State fans are going to 
have to weather the rough sea-
sons ahead with hopes that in 
four or ?ve years, the Nittany 
Lions can return to the former 
glory that they had under Pa-
terno.
SPORTS COMMENTARYPitt and Penn State football facing challenges, changes
ATHLETE PROFILEBen Bryant sets the bar high for student-athlete standards
ALEX TAPAK
Sports Co-Editor
Tartan defender of the 
men’s soccer team Ben Bry-
ant is not only impressive 
on the ?eld, but also in the 
classroom.
Last year, Bryant played 
in all 16 soccer games and 
started in 13 of them. He 
is a chemistry and Spanish 
double major, with minors in 
biomedical engineering and 
business administration. He 
plans on staying at Carnegie 
Mellon for a ?fth year and 
playing one more season on 
the soccer team because he 
had a medical redshirt when 
he was a ?rst-year. Upon ma-
triculation, Bryant plans on 
attending medical school.
He has been playing soc-
cer since the age of ?ve, for a 
total of 16 years. 
“The camaraderie our 
team has on the ?eld is the 
best part of being on the 
soccer team,” Bryant said. 
“My funniest moment on the 
team came last season when 
Chris Wysocki, a current ju-
nior, scored a must-needed 
goal, and after he pulled his 
jersey up to show a t-shirt 
underneath with the ques-
tion written, ‘Why Always 
Me?’ ” Bryant said.
The new season, with 
some key wins early, looks 
hopeful for Bryant. “My 
proudest moment thus far 
was when we beat Hobart 
and Stevens; Stevens was 
ranked seventh in the coun-
try this past weekend, kick-
starting our season with a 
2–0 record,” he said. 
“Ben is a great team-
mate and leader,” junior 
mid?elder Matt Sarett said. 
“He sets a good example for 
the younger players with his 
work ethic and attitude.” 
With such a strong start, 
the future for the team looks 
bright. “For this season, my 
goals for myself and the 
team are to win the UAA 
Conference and get a bid 
to the NCAA tournament 
to then compete for the na-
tional championship,” Bry-
ant said.
Overall, Bryant has had 
a great experience so far. 
“What is most rewarding, 
but also most challenging, 
about being a Carnegie Mel-
lon University athlete is jug-
gling the rigorous academics 
of Carnegie Mellon on top of 
a very busy athletic sched-
ule,” he said.

The men’s soccer team 
started its season strong at 
home with two victories. The 
team saw its ?rst win over Ho-
bart College with a 3–1 score, 
and its second was over sev-
enth-ranked Stevens Institute 
of Technology at 1–0.
This past weekend, the 
Tartans played two more 
games. After falling 5–3 to 
Baldwin Wallace College, the 
team rebounded with a 3–2 
win over Ohio Northern Uni-
versity. After only ?rst two 
weeks of play, the Tartans 
come away with a 3–1 total 
record.
Currently, the men’s soc-
cer team is ranked No. 13 in 
the nation.
The Tartans’ victories 
have been led by the upper-
classmen. In the ?rst game 
against Hobart, junior Matt 
Sarett scored the ?rst goal for 
the Tartans to tie the game. 
Senior Alex Abedian scored 
second to put the Tartans at 
a 2–1 lead, before junior Max 
Tassano scored to increase the 
lead to 3–1 before the game 
ended.
The game against Stevens 
kept the attention of Tartan 
fans, as the game was tied 0–0 
until the last 40 seconds of the 
game. 
The Tartans and their op-
ponents went back and forth 
the entire game. Both teams 
had opportunities to score, 
but saves from junior goal 
keeper Chris Madden kept the 
Tartans in the game. The Ste-
ven’s goal keeper held his own 
as well until the last seconds 
when senior John Crawshaw 
scored the only goal of the 
game.
Despite losing against 
Baldwin Wallace, the Tar-
tans still played a respectable 
game, scoring three goals. 
The ?rst came from junior 
Mike Ferraco and the other 
two came from sophomores 
Louis Ferragonio and Daniel 
Kursman-Neri. It was Ferra-
gonio’s ?rst goal as a Tartan.
Against Ohio Northern, 
Abedian was back in action, 
scoring his second goal of the 
season. Senior Ben Bryant 
scored the second goal of the 
game for the Tartans before 
Tassano followed Abedian’s 
footsteps and scored his sec-
ond goal of the season, seal-
ing the victory.
The Tartans will travel to 
Geneva College on Wednes-
day for a 7 p.m. game. 
The team will then host Al-
legheny College on Saturday 
for a 1 p.m. game on the Tar-
tans’ home turf, where they 
remain undefeated.

Dress to impress: How to make a good ?rst impression
SHWETA SURESH
Tartan Alumna
When it comes to making 
a good ?rst impression, ap-
pearance de?nitely matters. 
Carnegie Mellon students 
have a reputation of not caring 
too much about (supposedly) 
trivial things like attire. But at 
job fairs, recruiters are judg-
ing students not only by their 
résumés, but also the color of 
their suits.
With this in mind, it is im-
perative that students look 
polished and conservative. 
Finding the right pair of heels 
or the perfect tie is just as im-
portant as ?xing the format-
ting on your résumé.
Women
Since the dress code for the 
conferences is business for-
mal, women should stick to a 
conservative suit or skirt in 
black, navy, or gray. Wearing 
a suit jacket is a must, or you 
will end up looking too casual 
for the event. Also, try to avoid 
wearing lacy or silky camisoles 
under your jacket. A crisp shirt 
in a solid color is a much better 
option — not only is it a safe, 
conservative bet, but it also 
looks smart.
When it comes to styling, 
all attempts should be made 
to create a clean and polished 
look. Hair should be tied back 
neatly in a pony tail or pinned 
back so that it doesn’t fall on 
the face. Nude pantyhose are a 
must if you are wearing a skirt, 
and if you are wearing a pant 
suit, wear thin, nude socks.
As for accessories, the 
choice of shoes is an impor-
tant one. Don’t pick the styl-
ish, open-toed heels you 
would wear on a night out. In-
stead, go with a sensible pair 
of pumps. A quick tip: Make 
sure you are comfortable in 
your heels. Job fairs involve a 
lot of waiting in lines, and you 
don’t want to be doing all of it 
with sore feet. Add some sim-
ple jewelry to make your look 
more elegant and attractive. 
Stay away from large, chunky 
necklaces and long, dangly 
earrings. Find simple studs 
and a small pendant that suit 
your out?t and you’re good to 
go.
Men
A business suit is a neces-
sity for men. While colors like 
black, navy, and gray will all 
work, men can also impress 
in a pinstriped suit. A white 
shirt is the safest bet, and it 
is important to make sure the 
shirt cuffs are close to one-half 
of an inch longer than their 
jacket sleeves.
A special feature of the 
men’s look is the tie. Remem-
ber, the tie is supposed to 
serve as an accessory, not an 
attention-grabber; leave your 
Jerry Garcia tie at home and 
wear something more suited 
to the occasion. Additionally, 
if this is your ?rst time tying 
a tie, practice a few times be-
fore the day of the conference; 
YouTube has some good video 
tutorials. Make sure your tie is 
not too long and hanging be-
low your belt, or too short and 
stopping above it.
An important thing to keep 
in mind is that even though 
you may have put the perfect 
out?t together, all of it will 
amount to nothing if you are 
not con?dent about your ap-
pearance. While adhering to 
the dress code and smartening 
up your attire are essential, re-
maining cool and con?dent is 
even more important.

COURTNEY WITTEKIND
Staffwriter
When the TOC and BOC 
conferences wrap up, many 
students may be left with un-
met expectations. Whether 
looking for an internship or 
a full-time job, students still 
have a wide variety of options 
available to them.
Explore TartanTrak
While the conferences of-
fer an excellent opportunity to 
meet with potential employ-
ers in person, students have a 
much larger pool of employers 
available to them year-round 
through TartanTrak, which of-
fers over 11,000 company pro-
?les. These 11,000 businesses 
currently offer around 2,200 
positions for which Carnegie 
Mellon students can apply via 
the university’s online service.
The fairs “are wonderful 
opportunities for students to 
network with employers and 
to secure that ?rst interview. 
But it is not the only way,” said 
Farouk Dey, the director of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Career and 
Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) in an inter-
view two years ago.
“There are many employ-
ers who are out there who 
choose not to come to the 
conference for one reason or 
another but are still very inter-
ested in Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents. The ?rst place I would 
always send students to is 
TartanTrak,” Dey said. “I want 
to encourage every student, 
whether they get an interview 
or not, to go on TartanTrak 
and look up these employers.”
Students can visit 
TartanTrak to submit résumés, 
sign up for interviews, and 
explore job opportunities. 
Students can register for their 
TartanTrak login information 
at www.studentaffairs.
cmu.edu/career/students_
alumni/tartantrak.html.
Expand professional 
networks
According to Dey, the ma-
jority of university students 
across the country ?nd their 
jobs through previously estab-
lished connections.
“Networking is really the 
No. 1 way people get jobs,” 
Dey said. “Occasionally these 
connections can be neighbors 
or family friends, but most of 
the time these are profession-
al connections that students 
have developed through join-
ing clubs, organizations, or 
committees.”
Dey said that students 
must ?rst be aware of the con-
tacts they have available to 
them and then leverage these 
connections. Many, however, 
wonder how exactly to begin 
taking advantage of their net-
works. According to Dey, it is 
often just a matter of getting 
the word out.
“The ?rst place to start is 
to let people know that you’re 
looking — let your parents 
know, let your friends know, 
let your roommate know. In-
form people that you are ap-
proaching graduation and 
are beginning to look for a 
full-time position,” Dey said. 
“Just the fact that you’re let-
ting them know and asking 
them to keep you in mind if 
they hear about an opportu-
nity increases your chances of 
being in the right place at the 
right time.”
Take advantage of online 
networking
The advantages of online 
networking are often not 
succesfully leveraged by 
students. The internet, 
along with tools such as 
Facebook and LinkedIn, 
give students the option of 
reaching hundreds, if not 
thousands, of their friends 
and acquaintances with one 
click of a mouse.
“One of the tools I often 
recommend is LinkedIn. It is 
fantastic because it not only 
allows you to document all 
the people in your profession-
al network who you know, but 
it also allows you to tap into a 
larger network through those 
people,” Dey said.
As an example, Dey opened 
his own LinkedIn pro?le to 
show the power of the site. 
“This is my LinkedIn page and 
I use it very much. You can 
see I have 331 connections — 
these are people that I know 
personally through my career 
or some are also friends or ac-
quaintances. Through these 
331 connections I am then 
connected to 3,316,810 peo-
ple,” Dey said.
Dey explained the power 
of such online networking 
services by giving a hypotheti-
cal example. “If I am interest-
ed in working for Intel, I can 
type ‘Intel’ into the LinkedIn 
search. The ?rst people that 
show up in my list are the peo-
ple who are connected to me 
but also have a strong connec-
tion to Intel. They may know 
someone else who works 
there, or have worked there 
themselves. The great part 
about this is I now know who 
to contact to begin my search. 
It is a powerful way to look for 
connections.”
Be persistent
For those students who 
may leave the conferences 
feeling let down, persistence 
will pay off, according to Dey. 
He believes that it is impor-
tant to not give up when hunt-
ing for a job.
“Even the employers who 
you may have met at the 
[BOC/TOC/EOC] who maybe 
did not offer you an interview 
at the conference — it is okay 
to return to them and ask 
them to reconsider or if they 
have any other opportuni-
ties,” Dey said. 
“It really is a matter of en-
gaging your professional as-
sociations, networking both 
online and in person, getting 
involved, and I would ?nish 
by telling students to not lose 
hope. Be persistent.”
More opportunities if the job fairs don’t work out
Fewer employers coming to conference for business students
JACKSON LANE
Senior Staffwriter
Students in the Tepper 
School of Business were dis-
appointed to see that only 30 
companies would be attending 
this year’s Business Opportu-
nities Conference (BOC). This 
marks the fourth year in a row 
where employer attendance at 
the BOC has decreased from 
that of the previous year.
The BOC is an annual ca-
reer fair at Carnegie Mellon 
where students network with 
recruiters for business intern-
ships and full-time positions. 
The BOC is run by the BOC 
committee, an undergraduate 
student organization. In addi-
tion to the BOC, the Carnegie 
Institute of Technology spon-
sors the Technical Opportu-
nities Conference (TOC), a 
career fair for technical posi-
tions, while the Career and 
Professional Development 
Center (CPDC) hosts fall and 
spring Employment Oppor-
tunities Conferences (EOC), 
which are general career fairs.
This year’s BOC sees in par-
ticular the loss of “energy com-
panies” from previous years. 
Companies like DC Energy, Di-
rect Energy, and Tricon Energy 
all attended the BOC last year, 
but they will not return for the 
conference this time around. 
Major investment banks and 
consulting ?rms like JPMor-
gan Chase, Citigroup, Ernst & 
Young, and Accenture will also 
be absent.
Although these companies 
are still offering positions 
through TartanTrak, students 
at the BOC will miss out on 
networking opportunities. 
“Networking with recruiters 
really improves your chances 
of getting a job, so I’m disap-
pointed that almost none of 
the companies I’m interested 
in are coming to the BOC,” 
said Michael Wang, a senior 
business administration ma-
jor.
The co-chairs of this year’s 
BOC committee, seniors Bren-
dan Casey and Olubunmi Dai-
ro, could not be reached for 
comment.
The BOC’s decline stands 
in contrast to the growth in 
Carnegie Mellon’s other ca-
reer fairs and career oppor-
tunities. “Last academic year 
employer attendance at the 
Spring EOC was up 13 percent 
and we anticipate an increase 
in this October’s Fall EOC. Job 
postings were up 51 percent 
and the number of on-campus 
interviews was up 72 percent,” 
said Wesley Thorne, associate 
director of employer relations 
and college liaison to Tepper 
for the CPDC, in an email.
The number of companies 
attending the TOC also grew 
from 240 in 2011 to 290 in this 
year’s conference.
Jennifer Frick, assistant di-
rector and career consultant 
in the CPDC for Tepper under-
graduates, speculates that the 
career fair is still feeling the af-
tershocks of the 2008 ?nancial 
crisis. “The decrease in BOC 
registrations likely re?ects the 
decreased hiring in the ?nan-
cial services industry,” Frick 
said in an email. “2007 was 
one of our best years in terms 
of ?nancial services recruit-
ing, but with the problems in 
the ?nancial sector after 2008, 
we have seen less hiring, espe-
cially from investment banks.”
Brandon Ngiam, a senior 
mathematical sciences major 
and member of the 2009 BOC 
committee, believes that the 
small number of students in 
Tepper does not make attend-
ing the BOC a worthwhile in-
vestment for businesses.
“Companies want to focus 
their recruiting efforts at large 
numbers of students, and be-
cause Tepper is smaller than 
other schools, that’s why the 
BOC is so much smaller than 
the TOC and EOC,” Ngiam 
said. “Enrollment at Tepper 
has also been decreasing, so 
that might explain why fewer 
companies are attending each 
year.” In 2008, undergraduate 
business enrollment was 428, 
while in 2011, it was only 354.
There might also be a self-
perpetuating cycle contribut-
ing to the decline of the BOC 
and the growth of the other 
career fairs: Business students 
attend other career fairs due 
to the lack of companies at the 
BOC, while companies stop at-
tending the BOC because they 
can recruit business students 
at other career fairs.
For example, Nikki Mistry, 
a senior business administra-
tion major, plans to go to the 
BOC, TOC, and the EOC to 
look for consulting positions. 
“Many of the ?rms I’m inter-
ested [in] are going to be at 
the TOC and EOC, but not the 
BOC,” Mistry said. “The TOC 
recruiters might not speci?-
cally be hiring for consulting, 
but I at least can pass along my 
résumé to them.”
Meanwhile, many consult-
ing ?rms see that students like 
Mistry are attending the EOC 
and reason that attending the 
BOC is redundant. “We would 
see many of the same stu-
dents at the BOC that we see 
at Carnegie Mellon’s other ca-
reer fairs, like the EOC,” said 
Devin Carter, a recruiter for 
the consulting ?rm ZS Associ-
ates. “Since there is so much 
overlap, we don’t see the need 
to attend the BOC to recruit 
Carnegie Mellon students.”
It is unclear what next 
year’s BOC committee can do 
to reverse this trend. Ngiam 
suggests reducing the en-
trance fee. “It’s already a big 
commitment to ?y out to Pitts-
burgh and attend the BOC, 
and we may not be providing 
companies with enough stu-
dents and potential hires to 
justify the current entrance 
fee.” For-pro?t companies pay 
$500 for the basic package to 
host a booth at the BOC.
Mistry thinks that the BOC 
should involve the Tepper 
administration or the career 
center. “A big difference be-
tween the BOC and the  other 
career fairs is that the BOC is 
completely student-run, and 
I think that if the Tepper ad-
ministration helped run the 
committee, we would see a lot 
more companies coming.” 
For now, to all the discour-
aged business students wor-
ried about their careers, Frick 
emphasized, “Remember that 
the job fairs are just one step 
in the recruiting process for 
many companies. Especially 
for BOC, many of the compa-
nies are returning later for on-
campus interviews, case com-
petitions, and other events 
such as information sessions 
that further allow them to 
connect with students.”
How to perfect your résumé
ZANETA GRANT
Staffwriter
When going to the BOC or 
TOC, it is important to have 
a strong résumé to make you 
stand out from all the other 
candidates — in a good way, 
of course. Here are some 
short, informal guidelines for 
those who have never written 
a résumé before.
Header
In the heading, the name 
comes ?rst, and you want 
that to be the most prominent 
part. Make it noticeable, un-
der 40 point font, and either 
left-align or center-align it. A 
bold name in a formal serif 
(Garamond, Jenson, Trajan) 
will suf?ce. The address at 
which the writer receives 
most of his or her mail, as well 
as a phone number and email 
address, should also be in the 
heading. If you have a person-
al website, list it there as well.
Education
The education section 
is where you should put in-
tended majors or minors (if 
relevant), expected gradua-
tion date, and the name and 
location of your school. Once 
in college, you should try 
to avoid placing your high 
school on your résumé. You 
can include your college GPA 
if it is high — especially if you 
are a Dean’s List honoree. If 
your GPA is poor, leave it off 
— if recruiters really want to 
know, they will ask.
Experience
Here is the trickiest 
— and most important — 
part of your résumé. When 
listing your experiences, you 
should choose the ones that 
connect your skills to the 
quali?cations that the job 
asks for. However, don’t copy 
full-length sentences from the 
job advertisement.
What you should do is try 
to articulate your skills in a 
way that sounds similar to the 
skills the employer is looking 
for in a candidate. Eliminate 
use of the ?rst-person (“I did 
...”) if possible, and don’t for-
get to use active verbs when 
listing the tasks your job en-
tailed. For example, “Flipped 
burgers” (don’t put that on 
your résumé) is the correct 
verb form to use. You should 
also try to use bulleted lists to 
make it easier to scan the in-
formation. And stay concise 
— no one wants to read eight 
paragraphs about your retail 
experience.
Activities
In some cases, your activi-
ties might even be more rel-
evant than your actual work 
experience, and should thus 
be as boldly and centrally 
placed. You should try your 
best to list your most relevant 
activities. For example, if you 
are applying for a web design 
internship, list related activi-
ties: copy-writing, search en-
gine optimization, or visual 
design experience, to give a 
few examples.
As for other extra-curricu-
lar activities, you should high-
light activities you’re involved 
in — a club for which you 
only attended a single meet-
ing doesn’t count. As always, 
either cut out irrelevant infor-
mation or ?nd a way to tie it 
into the way you sell yourself.
Skills
This is where you advertise 
any skills that haven’t been 
addressed in the other sec-
tions. Be sure you are actu-
ally advertising real skills, not 
generic qualities that anyone 
can claim. List languages you 
speak and languages you code 
in. List a hobby or two that 
an interviewer might connect 
with and use to better under-
stand you as a person.
Take your résumé serious-
ly, and have someone like an 
adviser look over it because 
their advice will be tremen-
dously valuable. If you don’t, 
you could make silly mistakes, 
and your résumé might be 
perceived as a joke. It will pro-
vide the employer with a good 
laugh, but that is probably not 
what you are aiming for. Try 
to be professional, or at least 
try not to do something fool-
ish.

Pittsburgh as Gotham City
ToonSeum exhibit showcases Batman memorabilia
In the midst of the stately turn-of-the-century high 
rises and gleaming skyscrapers of Downtown, the 
ToonSeum makes a colorful statement. In the front 
window, in the midst of a number of other whimsical 
decorations, a small Batarang inconspicuously hints 
at the comic wonders that can be found inside. 
Pittsburgh as Gotham City, a special exhibit that 
opened July 21, features all things that combine 
Batman and Pittsburgh, from comics to film 
paraphernalia.
The recent hype from the release of The Dark 
Knight Rises is clearly a driving force behind the 
exhibit; however, the ToonSeum has done justice 
to the entire franchise by including an array of 
merchandise from throughout the years.
The exhibit features numerous attractions, not the 
least of which is a wall of Batman comic panels from 
a variety of Pittsburgh artists that pays homage not 
only to the longevity of the legend, but also to the 
tremendous skill of local illustrators. The collection 
ranges from Pittsburgh Post-Gazette artist Rob 
Rogers’ biting political cartoons to dramatic scenes 
depicted in DC Comics’ books, and all feature a 
familiar masked figure.
One wall of the exhibit shows a video screen with 
clips from the cartoon series and the recent films, 
while a speaker blares a dramatic soundtrack to 
enhance the overall experience. Alongside the 
video clips, several mock-official Gotham City Police 
dossiers on “criminals” hang on the wall — all about 
actors from the series who have connections to 
Pittsburgh.
In fact, many of the “criminals” are Carnegie Mellon 
alumni, including Ming Na (the voice of Dectective 
Ellen Yin in the animated series), Frank Gorshin (the 
voice of Professor Hugo Strange in the animated 
series), and Lou Scheimer (who produced the series 
for several years).
Fans with a passion for behind-the-scenes glimpses 
of The Dark Knight Rises will go batty for the original 
concept art and location research photos on loan 
from Warner Bros. that adorn the walls of the exhibit. 
The photos and sketches feature scenes from around 
town, some of which are close to home for Carnegie 
Mellon students, including the Mellon Institute and 
the Software Engineering Institute. All of the scenes 
— especially the striking photo of a destroyed Heinz 
Field — are easily recognizable, both from the movie 
and from walking around town.
The highlight of the exhibit is undoubtedly the 
Batman mask, which sits in a glass case in the 
middle of the room. The mask on display was worn 
by Christian Bale in the most recent installment of 
The Dark Knight and allows visitors a quick and 
iconic glimpse at the costuming magic of the film.
Pittsburgh as Gotham City offers an in-depth look 
at the Batman franchise, from the original comics to 
the television series and films. Even if you’re not a 
Batman aficionado, the exhibit is an interesting look 
at Pittsburgh’s affiliation with the franchise and is 
well worth the trip to the ToonSeum. The behind-
the-scenes photos are fascinating, and Batman’s 
connection to the city is enough to make any 
resident proud.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
I am an attractive female 
first-year, and all these 
older guys keep hitting on 
me. It’s really distracting! 
So what if I dress in 
revealing clothes and 
only go to parties where 
I can get in for free and 
then talk about myself the 
whole time? Why can’t 
these guys just give me 
my free drink and then 
leave me alone?
Thanks,

Dear ESPECIALLY THE 
OCS,
That’s a really tough 
problem. It must be so 
difficult to be a hot, young 
first-year. I’m really interested 
in what you have to say. 
Please go on. This is so 
fascinating to me. I am 
maintaining appropriate 
amounts of eye contact and 
nodding at what you say 
in agreement. While we’re 
talking, I’m throwing a party 
this weekend. You should 
totally swing by so we can 
hang out. And don’t worry, 
you won’t have to pay.
Oh wait, it’s past the first 
month of school? Never 
mind. For the first couple 
months of school, all the 
new students have that 
“first-year spark.” After their 
first grades start rolling in, 
that spark dies, and the 
first-years become just as 
unattractive as the rest of us. 
I am serious about that 
party, though. Swing by,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
For reasons I can’t get 
into here, I need to flee 
the country immediately. 
I have 10 items, each of 
which weighs a different 
amount and has different 
value to me, but I can only 
take some of them with 
me. How can I decide 
what to pack so I can stay 
ahead of the authorities?
Please hurry,

Dear INNOCENT,
Unfortunately for you, you’ve 
stumbled upon the knapsack 
problem, a classic problem 
in combinatorics. The issue 
is that the problem is NP-
hard. As a computer science 
major, I am required to avoid 
all such problems. If it can’t 
be solved in polynomial time, 
I can’t do it.
Admittedly, actually doing 
the math to pack your bag 
wouldn’t take long, but what 
am I, a mathematician? 
We computer scientists 
don’t compromise when it 
comes to nondeterministic 
polynomial time! What we 
should really be focusing 
on is why you’re fleeing the 
country in the first place. I’d 
suggest a sincere apology 
to get you out of trouble. If 
in the meantime you happen 
to discover a polynomial-
time algorithm for solving the 
knapsack problem, go on 
and forward that to me. 
Or just buy a bigger 
knapsack,
Patrick Hoskins

Last fall, when I would tell people that I was spending 
the following semester studying abroad in the Czech 
Republic, I invariably received two questions: “Do you 
even know Czech?” and “Do you at least know someone 
else studying abroad there too?” When I cheerily replied, 
“Nope!” to both those questions, it was followed (usually 
a bit incredulously) by, “Then, why would you pick the 
Czech Republic, of all places?”
I wanted a city where I could take classes in English; a 
city that was in Europe but wasn’t the usual Western 
European or Mediterannean locale to which so many 
American students tend to ?ock; and, to put it bluntly, 
a city that was cheap. Prague ?t all of those criteria 
perfectly. Plus, as someone with a minor in history, I 
couldn’t resist the opportunity to visit a city that was 
a thousand years old — and that had been part of the 
Soviet bloc, a fact that piqued my geeky interest.
Now that I’m back from Prague, people often ask me 
how my semester abroad was. I’m not quite as quick to 
answer this question, as it’s dif?cult to summarize my 
experiences in and feelings about Prague in a few brief 
sentences.
Prague is a gorgeous city; the Vltava River winds 
through its heart, dividing neighborhoods packed with 
cobblestone streets, elaborately designed churches, and 
beautiful old buildings. Unlike most European cities, 
Prague wasn’t bombed during either of the World Wars, 
meaning that many of its historic buildings and sites 
are still standing. From the 1,000-year-old Prague Castle 
complex and the Charles Bridge — which dates back 
to the 14th century — to the ordinary restaurants and 
apartment buildings that are hundreds of years old, the 
history was practically palpable on every street I walked 
down. I still remember how mind-blowing it was on my 
?rst day of classes to realize that my university building 
predated the formation of the United States.
It wasn’t just the ancient history of Prague that 
fascinated me, though. Between the Nazi occupation 
and the communist regime, the 20th century was not 
kind to the Czech Republic; and, despite the city’s 
best efforts, not every scar of the communist regime 
has been eradicated from Prague. Every monument to 
Soviet leaders may have been pulled down, but you 
can still occasionally ?nd relief sculptures celebrating 
the working class tattooed on the side of an apartment 
building.
Occasional Soviet architectural ghosts aside, Prague 
truly is beautiful. Many of my favorite days in the city 
were spent merely wandering the streets, my shoes 
wearing thin from the cobblestones as I walked down 
every side street to see what I could discover. I wanted 
to explore every park, every red-shingled apartment 
building, every massive Gothic church that I could ?nd. 
By the end of my semester there, I knew the city well 
enough to get around nearly anywhere, and I had stared 
at the skyline so often I could picture it with my eyes 
closed.
When I wasn’t learning as much as I could about the 
physical layout of Prague, I was trying to discover 
everything I could about the Czech culture — and there 
was certainly plenty to explore. Prague is practically 
over?owing with the arts: Art galleries, book stores, 
and jazz clubs can be found on every street, and there 
are plenty of theater performances — including many 
in English — to choose from every night. Best of all, 
everything was relatively inexpensive, meaning that I 
could go to museums, concerts, and galleries and still 
have enough Czech crowns left to go out with my friends 
in the evening.
Perhaps the greatest thing about living in Prague was 
the people. Czechs are incredibly reserved in public 
— they are suspicious of strangers when they try to 
strike up conversation, and even making accidental eye 
contact on the tram is embarrassing for them — but 
they’re incredibly warm and friendly once you get to 
know them.
I also got to know many members of the English-
speaking expatriate community; there are thousands of 
native English speakers living in Prague because they 
love the city, and many of them are interesting people 
dedicated to enjoying their life abroad. It made for a 
much slower lifestyle than here at Carnegie Mellon, 
which took some getting used to, but I learned to relax 
and appreciate the moment more, rather than just rush 
off to the next class or extracurricular activity.
This doesn’t even begin to cover all the incredible 
memories I have of Prague and all of the anecdotes I 
have about the city’s history, and yet it still doesn’t 
succinctly answer the question “How was your semester 
abroad?” The best answer that I have to settle for, then, 
is that it was a semester in a mind-bogglingly beautiful 
place; a semester in which I did more and learned more 
than I ever would have expected.

A rhetorical analysis of Das Racist
A rhetoric Ph.D. student attempts to understand popularity of “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell”
In 2008, the alternative hip-hop group Das Racist 
released a song, still heard today ringing from those 
gigantic speakers by the Fence, called “Combination 
Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.” The main refrain (and there are 
no verses, just refrain) goes:
I’m at the Pizza Hut;
I’m at the Taco Bell;
I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell.
After Das Racist’s performance in Rangos Sept. 1, 
presented by AB Coffeehouse, I was inspired to do a 
rhetorical analysis to get to the bottom of one of the deep 
mysteries of our time. Why is this song so popular, and 
what is it about the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell 
(CPHTB)?
1. Repetition
Roman rhetorician Quintilian said in Book 8 of his 
Institutio Oratio that rhetorical ornament like repetition 
“contributes not a little to the furtherance of our case as 
well. For when our audience ?nd it a pleasure to listen, 
their attention and their readiness to believe what they 
hear are both alike increased, while they are generally 
?lled with delight, and sometimes even transported by 
admiration.”
Similarly, in an interview with the Village Voice, Das 
Racist MC Himanshu Suri (Heems) noted: “My top 
?ve favorite poetic devices of all time are repetition, 
repetition, repetition, repetition, and repetition.”
Suri isn’t alone. Pop artists often use repetition in 
their songs to ?ll listeners with delight and transport 
them by admiration. Just think of John Mayer’s “Say,” 
Lady Gaga’s “Edge of Glory,” and Britney Spears’ 
“Womanizer.” People paradoxically love these songs 
and hate them, buying millions of copies even as they 
declare them to be insipid, vapid drivel because of their 
repetitiousness.
In this light, “Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell” can 
be read as counter-drivel. By caricaturing the trope of 
repetition into a grotesque parody, Das Racist makes 
an epistemic claim on repetition. After all, compared to 
“Combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell,” the repetition 
in Justin Bieber’s “Baby” is so derivative. Das Racist 
thus allows hipsters to protest corporate patterns of 
commercialization through their appreciation for pop 
music’s repetition as derivative — Das Racist ?lls them 
with delight, indeed.
2. Socioeconomic representations
There’s no getting around it: CPHTBs are not high 
class. Wall Street is not eager to hold business meetings 
at CPHTBs. The perfect date night does not usually 
include a CPHTB. In fact, with gas station snacks from 
Sheetz coming in at a close second, a CPHTB is food’s 
equivalent of a brothel: late-night, cheap, guilt-inducing 
indulgences in saturated fat and grease.
As obesity rates soar in America, especially among the 
lower class, it’s no wonder that the nearest rhyme Das 
Racist can think of for “Pizza Hut” is “pizza gut,” and for 
“Taco Bell,” “taco smell” (and from there, to rolling “L”s 
— CPHTBs go hand-in-hand with drug use). Many of 
us have experienced such places. But has Mitt Romney 
ever been to a CPHTB?
By choosing a socioeconomically loaded location, Das 
Racist allows audiences to identify with the common 
man. Real conversations take place by the people and 
for the people in local CPHTBs, not in Washington 
surrounded by wealthy delegates from around the 
country. Ever since the song’s release four years ago, 
it seems like everyone is at a CPHTB. Solidarity comes 
from shared experiences like these.
3. Semantic confusion
With such simple, emphatic lyrics, “Combination Pizza 
Hut and Taco Bell” must carry a clear message, right? 
Close inspection, however, twists such dreams as Das 
Racist pulls us into a crisis of geographic (and personal) 
ambiguity.
In the ?rst iteration, “I” am at the CPHTB. In the second 
iteration, a second voice says “I” am at the CPHTB. 
Then three times “we” are at the CPHTB. This is 
representative of a traditional discovery of community 
centered around a culturally constructed place.
But then the pronouns fade and all the listener hears is 
the identi?cation of the place. Has individuality been 
subsumed in common purposes? Has eating limited 
personal expression?
“Wait, wait.” After another round of “I,” Das Racist 
delves into the personal consequences of CPHTBs, 
then fades back into reiteration of the CPHTB. While 
“I” dominates the rest of the song, it is no longer an 
unambiguous “I” with unambiguous location. Rather, the 
two “I”s are contrasted and put in tension.
I’m at the Pizza Hut.
(No, you ain’t.)
I’m at the Taco Bell!
(I’m over here!)
I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell, where 
you at?
(I don’t see you!)
Here the failure to focus their two “I”s/eyes leads to 
disorientation and blindness. The “combination” of the 
two restaurants in one is a disaster, as the I-you duality 
breaks down and we are forced into the post-modern 
condition.
The confusion continues. The background beat becomes 
more insistent and distracting. A street name is 
discussed to no avail. We are in danger of losing touch 
with the place and people we identi?ed with so strongly 
at the beginning of the song. Then, with a quick laugh 
— as at a joke — unity is restored and the harmonious 
“I” reemerges.
The drama works to reinforce the listener’s faith in the 
combination Pizza Hut and Taco Bell. Over time, we are 
persuaded that, through mutual cooperation, society can 
emerge with resounding clarity and feeling. Our spirits 
cry out as one, “I’m at the combination Pizza Hut and 
Taco Bell!”

Coming from anyone else, the phrase, “As an individual, 
you can be more powerful than a whole country,” would 
seem hopelessly naïve.
But for Ai Weiwei, Chinese artist, dissident, and the 
subject of the recent documentary Ai Weiwei: Never 
Sorry, this statement is not only obvious fact — it may as 
well be the motto for his life’s work.
Never Sorry, currently playing at the Harris Theater 
in Downtown, chronicles Ai’s life and work in protest 
against an oppressive political regime. Famed for his 
incendiary and often profane artistic voice, Ai frequently 
found himself at odds with the Chinese government — 
from publicly criticizing the 2008 Beijing Olympics to 
investigating the deaths of thousands of schoolchildren 
in the 2008 Sichuan earthquake. Although it does not 
focus on Ai’s artistic ventures, Never Sorry perfectly 
balances political context with Ai’s rich personal story.
Created by ?rst-time director Alison Klayman during her 
time as a freelance journalist in China, the ?lm has won 
several international awards, including the Special Jury 
Prize at the Sundance Film Festival and Of?cial Selection 
at the Berlin International Film Festival. According to 
the documentary website, the ?lm aims to highlight 
a digital-age dissident who inspires on a global scale 
through a combination of art and politics.
Never Sorry slowly draws out Ai’s character over the 
course of the ?lm. While the documentary centers 
primarily on his political work, the ?lmmakers also grant 
viewers insightful glimpses into the man behind the 
work, including a particularly poignant response to an 
interview question, a touching conversation with his 
mother, and a ?ash of de?ance when he recounts his 
latest brush with the police. The result is a rich and 
compelling portrait of Ai: a humble yet stoic 55-year-old 
man, deeply burdened by his activism but duty-bound to 
continue it.
The disappointingly few artistic pieces featured in the 
?lm are powerful and fascinating: His 1997 work “Coca-
Cola vase,” for example, features a Neolithic vase (over 
3,000 years old) with a simple Coca-Cola logo painted 
across the front. Though certainly an act of de?ance 
against the current Chinese establishment, this piece 
has important artistic merit, even when removed from 
the political context.
By defaming something so ancient and culturally sacred, 
Ai has raised a highly provocative and artistically 
valid question: Are some objects so sacred as to be 
untouchable? Or are all objects simply objects? Amid the 
more dominant political elements of the ?lm, messages 
like these — which are also important to understanding 
Ai’s life and work — are often lost.
Although the ?lm does not fully explore all aspects of 
Ai’s life and work, Never Sorry strikes a good balance 
between condemning the Chinese government and 
praising one of its dissidents. The ?lm is far from pure 
propaganda, and yet throughout the documentary we are 
constantly reminded of the grave context surrounding 
Ai’s work. Amid this commentary, the ?lmmakers are 
also able to ?esh out Ai’s fascinating and oftentimes 
elusive character. In this way, Ai Weiwei: Never Sorry 
is in equal parts a compelling portrait of a daring artist 
and a criticism of the oppressive circumstances that 
surround him.

After 10 years in production, almost 
200,000 individual drawings, and 
one of the biggest budgets in 
Japanese animation history, Steamboy 
triumphantly arrived in 2004. Since 
then, it has gathered a strong following 
and high status among steampunk 
enthusiasts. Director Katsuhiro Otomo, 
of Akira fame, produces a second ?lm 
with spectacular sci-? sweep and bold

Merida is not your standard Disney

Brave draws a portrait of a strong, 
roguish young woman who decides to 
stand up for her right to think for herself. 
If lacking in the type of groundbreaking 
narrative ?ourish that we’ve come to 
expect from the studio, Brave is still 
a delicious feast of visual delight. The 
Scottish Highlands are rendered in 
astonishing detail and with plenty of 
cinematic panache.

Not only was Rango far-and-away the

that we’re living in a new golden age 
of animation where Pixar isn’t the only 
studio capable of expanding the visual 
and narrative template. It proudly sports 
a package of vocal performances that 
rank as the ?nest in recent memory. 
Johnny Depp plays Rango, an 
accidental sheriff who reinvents himself 
and changes a town forever. Rango 
ambitiously sets out to do no less than 
repackage and market the Western to 
a new generation, both subverting and 
paying homage to the recognizable

An explosion of 1960s rock and roll known as Jersey 
Boys has made its way to Pittsburgh, and is playing at 
the Benedum Center until Sept. 23. This hit Broadway 
musical outlines famous pop band Frankie Valli and The 
Four Seasons’ rise to fame. The tour production opened 
last Tuesday and has already begun playing to full 
houses. The current cast features two Carnegie Mellon 
alumni, both of whom give stellar performances.
Jersey Boys tells the story of Frankie Valli and his 
journey from being a boy with talent to an international 
superstar. Act I revolves around Tommy DeVito and 
his attempts to create a successful music quartet; the 
second half of the musical focuses on the now-successful 
quartet and its troubles with fame, money, and family.
Despite its small size, the cast of the production is 
fantastic. Brad Weinstock steals the show as the iconic 
Frankie Valli, and his performance is supported by an 
unforgettable Tommy DeVito, played by Colby Foytik. 
Jason Kappus is extremely entertaining as Bob Gaudio, 
and although Brandon Andrus is the least featured 
among the four, he is memorable as Nick Massi.
The staging throughout the show is sleek and the 
transitions are smooth. Pop art images are displayed on 
an electronic billboard that ?ies over the stage in nearly 
every scene. This vibrant display is a clever method 
of introducing scene changes and helps keep the 
transitions moving.
Jersey Boys acts as a time warp, transporting the 
audience back to the 1960s. Eye-catching costumes, 
thrilling music, and traditional set pieces all add to the 
’60s atmosphere. The show features several hit songs 
such as “Walk Like a Man,” “Bye Bye Baby,” and the 
show favorite, “Can’t Take My Eyes Off You.”
The musical is fast paced, with many small character 
roles in addition to the four main actors. Among them 
is Valli’s girlfriend Loraine, played by Carnegie Mellon 
alumna Kaleigh Cronin. Cronin, who graduated in 2011 
with a degree in musical theatre, plays a total of 18 
different characters in the show. “There are only three 
women in the show; we play over 50 parts combined,” 
Cronin said. “And that’s everything from waitresses to 
the boys’ mothers and girlfriends and nurses.”
Also part of the cast is Skye Scott, a 2010 alum of the 
Carnegie Mellon musical theatre program. Like Cronin, 
Scott plays multiple characters in the show, although 
his primary character is Billy Dixon. “It’s really exciting 
every night to go through this journey of playing so many 
different people,” Scott said. “It’s a little crazy because 
you’re changing costumes constantly and backstage is 
very hectic, but it’s a blast.”
Jersey Boys requires actors to make quick costume and 
set changes; however, Scott and Cronin both attest that 
their time at Carnegie Mellon trained them well for this 
type of show.
In her senior year, Cronin was one of three actors in a 
show called Vanishing Point. “I had to play a million 
parts in that,” Cronin explained, “and it really prepared 
me for an experience like Jersey Boys. Lots of costume 
changes, jumping between voices and characters. That 
was actually the perfect segway into my role in Jersey 
Boys.”
With its classic music and great American success story, 
it’s no wonder that Jersey Boys is drawing in theater 
patrons from across the country. So far, the show has 
experienced an enthusiastic reception from the public 
— even at the preview night last Tuesday. “Usually for 
preview nights, people aren’t so responsive,” Cronin 
said, “but it was awesome. There were tons of people 
there and the crowd was great.”
The tour cast has been making its way across the nation 
for nearly a year, and Pittsburgh is just one stop of many. 
As Scott put it, “We’re getting paid to tour the country 
and experience every city. We’ve been doing the show 
for 10 months now.... We’re really in a great groove now 
with the show.”
Indeed, this “groove” is evident throughout the 
performance as all of the actors change roles seamlessly 
and maintain their energy throughout the performance. 
“Jersey Boys is the most amazing show. It appeals to 
everyone,” Cronin said. “I used to think it was a show 
for people my grandparents’ age, but it really is so much 
fun.”

Left: Senior global studies major Jena Tegeler walks through Parastou Forouhar’s “Written Room.”
Right: Senior mechanical engineering major Patrick Hogan participates in Betsy Damon’s piece about water 
resources in the basement of the Mattress Factory.
“Feminism is not just about women and not just about 
identity politics. It’s a way of thinking, and it affects 
everything.”
Visitors to the Mattress Factory’s latest exhibition, 
Feminist and..., will likely be surprised at its content. 
While all of the pieces are clearly based on an 
understanding of feminist ideals, they are not overtly 
about feminist issues. But as curator Hilary Robinson 
noted above, feminism is a way of thinking, not a set of 
beliefs. In fact, much of the “feminism” in the exhibit is 
actually what viewers bring with them when they walk 
through the door.
The exhibit, which is guest-curated by Robinson — a 
professor of art theory and criticism at Carnegie Mellon 
— features work by six female artists from around the 
world: Ayanah Moor, Julia Cahill, Parastou Forouhar, 
Carrie Mae Weems, Loraine Leeson, and Betsy Damon. 
Together, their work shows that feminism is not a 
single set of political beliefs; rather, it is as diverse as 
the art world itself: multivocal, multigenerational, and 
multicultural.
The idea for the exhibit came to Robinson three years 
ago after she saw a presentation by Weems responding 
to the election of President Barack Obama. “I thought, 
here is this woman who I know is a feminist, who has 
been informed by feminist thinking, responding to a 
historical moment,” Robinson said.
The idea of women’s responses to historic events — 
and how their experiences and cultures shape that 
response — was the basis for the exhibit. Indeed, 
each of the artists in the exhibit offers a unique 
perspective, reacting to what she sees as feminism in an 
individualized way.
The highlight of the exhibit is Forouhar’s “Written 
Room,” in which she covered the walls and ?oor 
of a room with Farsi script. Because the text is 
incomprehensible to those who can’t read Farsi — 
the majority of Western viewers — it becomes pure 
ornament and viewers are forced to either accept that 
they cannot read it or project meaning onto it.
Surrounded by the patterns on all sides, viewers are 
completely immersed in the script and are likely to 
assume that it says something meaningful and exotic 
— when, in fact, the script is just a jumble of letters and 
syllables. “The whole point of it is that it’s nonsense.... 
We can project meaning onto it, but really there’s 
nothing there. But as Westerners, we really have no 
idea,” Robinson explained.
In the room behind Forouhar’s piece is Weems’ “Lincoln, 
Lonnie and Me — A Story in 5 Parts,” an 18-minute 
video projection project. The video is projected into 
the black space between bright red theater curtains, 
creating a ghostly effect. Weems’ work investigates 
family relationships, gender roles, and the histories 
of racism, sexism, class, and other political systems. 
Through its video clips and voice-overs, her piece 
presents a strong call to action and reminds us that we 
cannot engage in thoughtful debate when we all have 
strong preconceived notions of what is right. Through 
her piece, she encourages viewers to remember what 
women are ?ghting for now and what they have been 
?ghting for throughout history.
The youngest of the six artists, Cahill presented the 
most obvious feminist piece in the exhibit. Cahill, who 
graduated from Carnegie Mellon with a Bachelor of Fine 
Arts in May, typically works with performance and video 
art to present her commentary on pop culture. For her 
piece for Feminist and..., “Breasts in the Press,” Cahill 
rewrote the lyrics to “My Humps,” a pop song by the 
Black Eyed Peas. “I like to look at songs that are sung by 
female pop stars that are often seen as empowering, but 
when you actually look at the song lyrics it’s quite the 
opposite,” she said.
Small videos of Cahill performing her reworded song are 
projected onto a large statue reminiscent of Venus de 
Milo — just with much larger breasts.
“I basically just gave her a boob job with plaster,” 
Cahill said. Explaining her decision to exaggerate the 
sculpture’s female form, she said, “What I really love to 
do with my work is get a message across through humor. 
And it’s a challenge because I don’t want to make it 
seem like I’m making fun of issues — it’s a very ?ne 
line. I want people to laugh a little bit but realize that it’s 
something very serious.”
On the whole, the exhibit does an excellent job of 
representing a wide range of perspectives on feminism. 
While each of the pieces certainly has some feminist 
undertones, it’s not intimidating to those unfamiliar 
with feminist theory. The pieces are not overtly about 
feminism or feminist issues, but the title of the exhibit 
invites viewers to interpret each of the pieces with their 
idea of feminism in mind.
While this abstraction makes the exhibit very accesible 
to a wide audience, it does leave something to be 
desired. Without paying very close attention or 
having background knowledge of the artists, it can be 
unclear what some of the pieces are trying to say. The 
descriptions provided in the gallery guide give some 
information, but they are hardly enough to understand 
the point of the exhibit.
In the end, though, the exhibit is not about what we 
typically think of as feminism, and leaving it open for 
interpretation is more realistic of the movement itself. 
As Robinson put it, “[Feminist and...] says that feminism 
is not something of the 1970s.... Feminism is important, 
and it is urgent.”

It’s tough being the quintessential hipster band of 
the new millennium.
Animal Collective didn’t create this label, of course, 
but the group of post-twenty-somethings (a.k.a. 
“thirty-somethings”) certainly asked for it: The lyrics 
are rambling and frequently silly, the beat is complex 
and interesting, and — most importantly — the 
group’s members experiment with so many different 
styles that it’s dif?cult to label theirs as one type of 
music.
Take Animal Collective’s progression over the years. 
The group has felt the need to morph itself, from 
the twitches and yelps of 2004’s high-strung Sung 
Tongs to the laid-back “wa-was” of the band’s big 
hit Merriweather Post Pavilion. One would assume, 
then, that the new album Centipede Hz would keep 
moving in that direction, perhaps with less focus on 
the vocals than ever before.
With Centipede Hz, the band takes two drastic 
departures from the feel-good albums of its recent 
past. The ?rst is that the band’s members wrote and 
recorded this album all together in the same location 
— a rare treat. And second, perhaps in?uenced 
by the previous fact, they break the progression, 
making an album that sounds more like a synthesis 
of old and new, a coupling of the concentrated 
vocals of early albums and the laid-back nature of 
newer ones.
The album’s ?rst song, “Moonjock,” is a perfect 
example of the album’s entire aesthetic, and is 
proof that the band’s break from a chill indie style 
was deliberate. “This is the new,” says a distant 
radio announcer, and then come some crashes that 
would make any regular listener of Merriweather 
Post Pavilion jump. When founding member Avey 
Tare comes in with his vocals, it becomes apparent 
that this is still feel-good music — just a little more 
spastic than the Collective’s albums since 2007.
Centipede Hz should be great. It should take 
what worked from all their previous albums and 
modify it to near perfection, expertly balancing 
lush and brittle. And they nearly make it — but 
there’s something a little off-putting about most of 
the songs, especially for those who have followed 
Animal Collective since its early days: The only new 
thing about Centipede Hz is that there’s nothing 
new.
On every Collective album up to now, the band 
has always had something original to offer, a new 
soundscape for the listener to traverse. Centipede 
Hz feels like a mash-up of its styles before and 
after 2007’s Strawberry Jam, and that can be a bit 
disappointing when experiencing the album.
This doesn’t mean that the album isn’t a good listen. 
Animal Collective knows by now how to make great 
album pieces, and in Centipede Hz each song ?ows 
into the next ?awlessly. “Applesauce” is a bubbly, 
nonsensical, and thoroughly enjoyable song, and 
listening to “Wide Eyed” — which has Deakin 
on vocals, a welcome change from Tare’s howls 
— elicits a vision of a huge crowd swaying and 
shouting along. “Today’s Supernatural,” the most 
advertised song from the album, is certainly the 
most mainstream-sounding piece, which coming 
from Animal Collective is a bit strange. But it’s a 
pretty great song, nonetheless.
This album would be a great listen for those who 
want an introduction to Animal Collective, since — 
while it’s not exactly indicative of everything the 
band’s done so far — it still showcases what the 
band is capable of.
