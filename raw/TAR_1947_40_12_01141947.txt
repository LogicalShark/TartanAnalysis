Election Tuesday May Write 
Finis to Carnegie Tradition
Spring Carnival, traditional fes­
tive weekend, will dwindle de­
cidedly if, at the all-school elec­
tion slated for next Tuesday, the 
student body does not indicate 
strong desire to substitute a day 
in spring vacation for two days 
at carnival time.
Last summer the administra­
tion, though they Were fully 
aware of the plans made for hold­
ing Carnival the first week in 
May, went ahead and made out 
the academic calendar leaving no 
free time on that or any other 
weekend.
Administration Not Convinced
The administration said that it 
was not convinced that the stu­
dents want to see college life re­
vived at C.I.T.
A vote “YES” means:That Spring Carnival will consist of: Scotch and Soda ; a Midway typical of a regular carnival with booths and rides; two bid dances, one with a well- known local band, one with a big-name band; Call Day and coronation of a Campus Queen; sweepstakes and roller derby; fireworks; a parade with many floats; and numerous games and acts on which the carnival committee is now working.A vote “NO” means:That Spring Carnival will consist of: one dance; Call Day and Coronation; and the Sweepstakes.
To prove that the campus does 
want Spring Carnival, Cloyd Mel- 
lott, Chairman/ of the committee, 
suggested that the matter be put 
to a vote. To this the administra­
tion has agreed. Now it is entirely 
up to the student body.
They have the choice of giving 
up the first day of Easter vaca­
tion, Thursday, April 1, and re­
ceiving in return two days, Fri­
day and Saturday, for Carnival, 
or they can give up the tradition­
al three-day celebration.

The Thistle is sponsoring a 
beauty contest for Thistle Queens. 
The contest will be held on Mon­
day afternoon, January 20, at 4:30 
p. m. in the recreation hail on the 
fourth floor of Margaret Morrison.
The queen and her four at­
tendants will be chosen by faculty 
members and fashion experts act­
ing as judges. The contest will be 
much the same as it was last year 
with each sorority and Citcom 
nominating two senior girls, mak­
ing a total of 16 candidates. These 
candidates for queen will be judg­
ed on good looks, personality, 
charm, and general appearance.
The student body and all fac­

Veterans Center 
Reorganizes Staff 
To Expedite Work
In order to increase efficiency 
and expedite the handling of 
claims, the Veterans center at 
Carnegie Tech has recently ex­
panded its facilities and increas­
ed its personnel to include four 
full-time employees, including 
two authorized training officers.
As of January 1, 1947, the of­
fice, located on the main floor of 
Industries hall, has been oper­
ating as a branch of the Pitts­
burgh Regional office. Previously 
the office was merely a consulta­
tion service with a training officer 
in attendance only three times 
each week.
The reorganization enables the 
office at C. I. T. to deal directly 
with the regional office in down­
town Pittsburgh, eliminating the 
necessity of sending records and 
claims to the Oakland branch for 
transfer." **.'
With the present setup a truck 
makes delivery of records and 
claims between Carnegie and the 
regional office three times daily. 
It is estimated that at least twen-

Stanford Offers 
Drama Fellowships
Stanford university is offering 
six eight-month fellowships of 
$1500 each for drama students, 
four for actors, and two for tech­
nicians, costumiers or designers.
The applicants must have re­
ceived a B. A. degree in Drama at 
some accredited university or col­
lege and have been actively en­
gaged in professional, amateur, 
or community theaters.
The successful candidates will 
begin work at Stanford on Feb­
ruary 1, 1947. For further infor­
mation write to Hubert C. Heff­
ner, Speech and Drama depart­
ment, Stanford University, Palo 
Alto, California.
Rifle Team Vacancies
The men’s varsity rifle team 
still has a few vacancies. Try­
outs will be held this week on 
Wednesday, Thursday, and 
Friday from 1:30 to 4:30 at the 
rifle range in the basement of 
MMCC.
Film Arts 
Selects Plot
The Film Arts Steering com­
mittee has selected a plot, sub­
mitted by Marvin Kolatch and 
Bill Heller, freshmen drama stu­
dents, for the first movie to be 
produced by the club.
The committee met last Thurs­
day to review eight rough outlines 
of scenarios. That presented by 
Heller and Kolatch was judged to 
be the most suitable for an initial 
production by the club, and they 
are now at work on the full- 
length script for the film. Actual 
filming is not scheduled to begin 
until next semester, as there are 
many technical details yet to be 
worked out.
The Photography and Light 
committee of the club will meet 
Friday, January 17, at 4:30 p. 
m. in Room B, Carnegie Union.

Manly Charms Displayed 
At King of Hearts Ball
The King of Hearts Ball, the 
»-event that caused such a stir last 
year, is here again. Mortar Board, 
senior women’s honorary, is spon­
soring this all-school semi-formal 
dance on February 8 in the men’s 
gym, with the music of Joey Sims 
and his orchestra. During the 
evening, refreshments will be 
served in the Black Cat and at 
some other location to be an­
nounced later. Tickets will cost 
two dolla-- "OT~ oouDle.
Each fraternity or independent 
group which submits a candidate 
for the title of “King of Hearts” 
must send a picture of the heir- 
presumptive to the Tartan not 
later than Friday, January 17. The 
pictures will be published in the 
following issue.
Elections for king will be held 
on Friday, February 7 and not at 
the dance, as was done last year. 
Not only will one lucky man be 
crowned king, but also, each can­
didate will receive a gift worthy 
of royalty in memory of the oc­
casion.
Although the first affair of this 
kind was held only last year, Mor­
tar Board hopes to make the King
Home Ecs Adopt Petite Michelle
Michelle Bothuan
The Home Ec Club has finally 
learned that their adopted war 
child, previously referred to as 
“it,” is a little girl.
Her name is Michelle Bothuan 
and she lives in France. Although 
only eleven years old Michelle 
has all the attributes of a bud­
ding French beauty. Her big 
brown eyes and brown pigtails, 
together with a sweet young smile, 
have captured the hearts of her 
new foster parents.
Michelle’s real parents were 
both school teachers in France. 
When the war broke out, M. 
Bothuan put away his books and 
joined the resistance movement. 
Later he was captured and put 
to death by the Germans. Since 
his death, Mme. Bothuan’s health 
has suffered so greatly that aid is 
necessary for the support of her 
three children.
Of course the members of the 
Home Economics club have not
legalh' adopted Michelle. She still 
lives with her mother in their 
home in France. The club has 
merely pledged to help support 
her through the Foster Parents’ 
Plan for War Children, Inc., a 
new organization in New York. 
They are not even legally obligat­
ed to fulfill their pledge, in fact, 
the only “legal’ thing in the adop­
tion is the “law of the heart”— 
and it is remarkably efficient.
The girls in the club are send­
ing their young charge a package 
a month to keep her tummy full 
and her body warm, and a letter 
a week to help keep her chin up 
high.
They have planned several 
money-raising projects to raise 
the $15 a month needed to pay for 
Michelle’s food and clothing. In 
the first of these projects the girls 
made Christmas tree ornaments 
of brightly colored metallic paper

of Hearts Ball an annual dance. 
This equivalent of. a female betku- „ 
ty contest gives the men on cam­
pus a chance to show that they 
have more than mere brawn and 
brains.
Last year’s campaign was one 
of the most spirited seen on cam­
pus for a long time. Besides put­
ting up the usual posters which 
ordinarily herald an event of this 
magnitude,, the various groups 
sponsoring candidates engaged in 
such activities as painting the 
sidewalks with rousing messages, 
entertaining Skibo-ites with songs 
and cheers, and enlisting the sup­
port of the world-renowned Dr. 
R. H. Coo. Bill Thunhurst won 
the title for the Betas, Who hold 
•the award at present.
WCIT Features 
New Programs
WCIT is presenting a new series, 
Adventures in Learning, starting 
Monday, January 20, at 7:30.
Dr. Max Schoen, head of the 
department of Psychology, will 
present Dr. John L. Synge, head 
of the department of Applied 
Mathematics; Dr. Harold Lang, 
head of the department of Gen­
eral Science; Dr. Immanuel Ester- 
mann, Professor of Physics; and 
Rev. Hugh Clark of the Church

For New Talent
Eddie Cantor will give six stu­
dents from the editorial staffs of 
college publications a tryout on 
his writing staff if they submit 
promising sample scripts.
The NBC comedian is exploring 
a new field in his search for fresh 
comedy-writing talent. Eligible 
students are asked to write to 
Eddie Cantor at 324 South Bev­
erly Drive, Beverly Hills, Califor­
nia, for sample program outlines. 
Cantor will pay all expenses for 
those selected.
and Margaret Morrison, at that 
time.
The opening of the additional 
seats for Student council was 
caused by the large increase in 
the number of students at Tech. 
According to the regulations for 
representation, there is to be one 
member of student council for 
every one hundred members of 
the student body. (The motion to 
change the representation from 
100 to 150 students was defeated 
at the last election.) This permits 
an increase of 13 representatives 
from the engineering school, 2 
from M. M. C. C., and 3 from 
Fine Arts (2 seniors and 1 junior.) 
There are 32 candidates from en­
gineering, 4 from M. M. C. C., and
5 from Fine Arts (2 seniors and 3 
juniors.)
Among these candidates, the 
following have not submitted 
platforms: Engineering, Ben Bak- 
larz, Robert Johnson, Elmer 
Kaelin, Bruce Murray, Arthur 
Naylor, Gerald G. O’Brien, Premo 
John Pappafava, Edward C. 
Peetz, Margaret Morrison, Jane 
Dowd, Katherine Glass, Fine Arts 
Seniors, Lester L. Stanford, Phil­
lis Petrikin; Juniors, Jay Maratta, 
Jack McIntyre, Irene Surenda.
Preferential balloting is used 
in tabulating the results of the 
election. This system is one of 
those available for election of a 
large number of candidates. To 
cast a vote using this method of 
balloting, the following proced­
ure should be followed:
1—Each voter is permitted to vote 
only for the candidates from 
his respective school.
2—Each voter must choose a 
candidate for every blank 
space provided on the ballot. 
The number of blanks avail­
able is determined by the 
number of candidates to be 
elected for the given school. 
ANY BALLOT NOT HAVING 
EVERY BLANK SPACE FTLL-
_ ED WILL NOT BE COUNT­
ED.
3—Choice of candidates must be 
listed in order of preference, 
i. e. place your first choice 
first, second choice second, 
etc., filling every blank space 
indicated.
4—Ballots are counted assuming 
that the voter has chosen the 
candidates in order of his pref­
erence.

Why Vote?
The citizen’s neglect of his privilege and responsibility of 
casting a vote is a glaring factor in the miscarriage of democ­
racy by graft, corruption, crooked polities, controlled machines, 
and general inefficiency in public offices.
Because of these blemishes, twentieth century American 
government is maimed, a dismal substitute for the plans of 
the constitutional fathers. And the blame for this brutality does 
not fall entirely on politicians and bosses as so many of the citiz­
enry are anxious to believe; it falls equally on the voters who 
elect these bosses either by not voting or by voting unthink­
ingly. Then, having supported corruption by failing to vote, these 
same parlor Americans loquaciously blast the government they 
themselves are responsible for.
By neglecting to cast his ballot, the voter is giving the 
green light to that portion of the people who sell out to graft, 
corruption and machines; the “why-bother-voter” actively gives 
his consent to corruption and ignorance in voting and corrup­
tion and ignorance in public offices. *
No vote at all is a vote against good government.
The importance of casting a thoughtful ballot is the same 
in a democratic self-governed association of any size. If an effi­
cient, representative, uncontrolled governing body is desired, 
everyone should participate in the choice of representatives.
Student government at Carnegie Tech is on paper a demo­
cratic body. Like our national government, it too has been ac­
cused of machine control, crooked politics, and inefficiency. Yet 
as long as all the students fail to participate in the election of 
their representatives, Council will remain a highly imperfect 
body.
At C.I.T., as anywhere else, no vote at all is a vote against 
good government.

On Fraternity Row
Sigma Nu’s enlarge ranks! Not 
only have Bob Carringer and Don 
Hunter recently pledged to the 
fraternity, but also Tom Culbert­
son and Joe Brown have joined 
the brothers. They are transfers 
from Brown university and Kan­
sas university, respectively.
The Sweetheart dinner held 
Saturday at the DU house for all 
the girls pinned to DU’s and for 
the wives of the brothers was a 
gala affair. Each girl was given 
two gardenias and a wonderful 
meal. A party followed the din­
ner, with dancing and entertain­
ment.
The reason for the smiles on 
the faces of the Tau Delts? Repre­
sentatives came back to Pitts­
burgh from the Tau Delta Phi Na­
tional convention in New York 
after capturing the Extra-Curric­
ular Activities cup in the face of 
stiff competition from chapters 
all over the country.
It was a triple kill for the 
PiKA’s over the holidays when 
Jim Nichol pinned Dody King, 
“Lefty” Watts, Mary Lou Thorpe, 
and George Fortney, Jeanne Knee. 
The crowning event was Wayne 
Redd’s announcement of his mar­
riage to Linda Leigh Cowherd. 
The ceremony occurred in Wash­
ington, D. C.

Portrait of Margaret Morrison 
Now Hangs in Halls of M.M.C.C.
If any of those who have re­
cently been called onto Dr. Wat­
kins’ carpet were not too occu­
pied to be normally observant, 
they immediately noticed a 
strange painting reposing against 
the office wall.
This addition is a full-length 
portrait of Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie, the mother of Andrew 
Carnegie.
According to a signature found 
in the lower right-hand corner of 
the picture, John J. Hammer 
painted Mrs. Carnegie in 1886, on­
ly a few months before her death.
The school’s other portrait of 
Margaret Morrison which hangs 
in the M. M. C. C. library (hint 
to whoever prepares next year’s 
traditions exam) differs from 
Hammer’s in that it only shows
her face. In Hammer’s full- 
length painting she is pictured 
sitting in a rocking chair on a 
porch entirely surrounded by 
luxurious scenery.
The painting was offered to
C. I. T. by Mrs. Miller, Carnegie’s 
daughter, when the estate of the 
late Mrs. Andrew Carnegie was 
being settled.
If the college had not accepted 
this offer, the painting would 
have been sent to relatives in 
Scotland.
Dr. Watkins expects to have 
the picture hung in the commit­
tee room of the Margaret Morri­
son building, although these plans 
may be changed if a more appro­
priate and conspicuous setting can 
be found.
Uncle Herb’s ringing toast rang 
out the old year ’46 at the New 
Year’s Eve party at the SAE 
house and introduced the gang­
ling baby ’47 (A1 Erickson) to all 
party participants. The fall semes­
ter pledge class came back at the 
actives in a skit given at the 
pledge party, January 4, which 
was styled in night club fashion. 
Needless to say, their glory was 
short-lived.
Theta XI chapter president 
Doug Fields presented Mrs. Heald, 
house-mother, with a sweetheart 
pin at dinner Tuesday, January 7.
An informal open house was 
held at the TX house January 4, 
and one also followed the bas­
ketball game last Saturday night.
Sad story—me three goldfish 
presented to the Beta Sigs by Ann 
(Kelly) Kennedy and Joyce 
Kingston have suffered the same 
fate that befell their predecessors. 
Seems that one of the guests at 
the last party thought that now 
that winter was here, the goldfish 
should swim in anti-freeze, in­
stead of water. The switch was 
fatal, and the goldfish bowl is 
empty once again. The fellows are 
waiting for spring in hopes of 
having better luck.
On Saturday eve, January 11, 
AEPhi’s held their formal initia­
tion in the French Room of the 
Schenley Hotel. Nine girls don­
ned the gold and pearl pin. A 
dinner in their honor followed the 
ceremony, with mothers and 
friends of both active and neo­
phytes invited.
Tri Delts held an “Apple-pol- 
isher’s Tea” for all their profes­
sors on Sunday afternoon in the 
Union. Final exams are near, 
you know!
Congratulations are also in or­
der for the ten new initiates into 
Sigma Kappa. Formal initiation 
was held at Lois Brunn’s home, 
January 4. A banquet was serv­
ed at the College Club after the 
ceremony.
Chi Omega’s gave a tea dance 
for TX’s at the Theta Xi house 
just before Christmas and pre­
sented them with a gift in the 
form of curtains and table cov­
erings for their recreation rooms.

Spring Carnival
To the Editor and the students:
I’m writing this in an attempt 
to answer some of the questions 
that have arisen or may arise in 
the future concerning the Spring 
Carnival-Easter vacation day ex­
change. We are asking that class­
es be attended on Thursday April
3, of Easter vacation in exchange 
for an excuse from classes on Fri­
day and Saturday, May 2nd and 
3rd, in order that Spring Carnival 
can be scheduled on these two 
days.
The main reason for this is that 
the Spring Carnival committee 
plans to have one of the biggest 
and best Spring Carnivals that 
Tech has ever had, and will be 
unable to do so unless the above 
plan is accepted by the students. 
If it is not accepted, the activities 
will be curtailed to those few 
that can be held on Saturday af­
ternoon and evening. A compari­
son of the two programs appears 
elsewhere in this paper.
It came to my attention that 
some students think that the Car­
nival can be held as planned, with 
or without classes. This is defi­
nitely incorrect. No student ac­
tivity can be scheduled during 
classes, and every evening activi­
ty has to be curtailed at 12:00 
p.m. when there are classes the 
next day. These are rules about 
which we can do nothing.
Some students have asked me 
why time was not allotted for the 
Carnival on the social calendar. 
As early as the summer of 1946, 
we attempted to bring that about,
but to no avail. It has taken all 
the time since then to get the 
Executive Board to grant permis­
sion to go ahead on the above 
plan.
The Spring Carnival committee 
has planned Mid wants to give 
you two days of gay and enjoy­
able activities, opening with the 
Scotch and Soda production the 
preceding evening, Thursday, May 
1. The Midway, which we plan to 
make the largest Tech has had, 
will share the program that eve­
ning.
The question becomes one of 
deciding whether you as students 
want a Carnival on the scale that 
we have planned. That I cannot 
answer for you — even though I 
might like to do so. We want a 
poll of the entire student body; 
so be certain that you cast your 
vote. The poll will be held con­

Skibo Prices
Dear Editor—
The oft repeated assertion that 
Skibo is a non-profit enterprise, 
operated purely for the conveni­
ence of Tech students and faculty, 
nauseates me almost as much as 
some of the food served there 
does. What I’d like to see is an 
itemized financial report which 
could prove that statement. The
cry of high quality and ample 
portions is also rattier sickening 
in view of the facts.
The bare facts are these: there 
are at least two restaurants which 
I could name that are within 
walking distance of Tech. They 
make no pretense of operating on 
a non-profit basis. They serve 
meals equal to or better in quali­
ty and portion than Skibo — the 
prices are the same or slightly 
lower than the well-fed Skibo 
customer pays.
You guessed it — I seldom eat 
at Skibo — you see I promised 
myself once that if I ever got out 
of the blankety-blank army I’d 
never stand in a chow line or 
carry my dishes to the “pearl 
divers” again. Well that isn’t the 
only solemn promise to myself 
that I have broken and I’d con­
tinue to break that one if I could 
get a better meal at a lower cost.
In one of the earlier discussions 
of this question the Tartan print­
ed an opinion that the “Skibo at­
mosphere” had a pecuniary value 
which should be reckoned in with 
the price of a meal. Whenever I 
feel the need for some of that at­
mosphere I go over and get a cup 
of coffee (5c at any second class 
restaurant) and smoke a cigar­
ette.
There’s the challenge Skibo — 
prove that you’re operating non­
profit — and if you can prove it— 
to modify a phrase lifted from the 
current issue of “Readers Digest” 
—“you no more fit run restaurant 
than godsake.”
Sincerely
H. W. Crandall.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTANS
YM-YW Holds Retreat; 
AIEE Elects Officers
Kiltie Band Meeting
Kiltie band practice will be 
held January 15, in Thistle 
hall. Officers for the spring 
semester will be elected.
Spring Carnival
[Continued from page 1] 
nival has in the past been a three- 
day celebration featuring a colos­
sal musical show by some of the 
best student talent in the country, 
and dancing to the top bands of 
the nation, all along with the gay, 
mystic atmosphere of a typical 
carnival.
For this spring a name band has 
already been assured, Scotch and 
Soda ¡has its musical show under 
production, and fraternities and 
sororities have entered booths, 
buggies, and floats. All are await­
ing a green light from the stu 
dents next Tuesday.
Decisive Vote Needed 
A failure of the student body to 
vote “yes” overwhelmingly will 
mean death to Spring Carnival. It 
will degenerate to a single dance 
on Saturday night. There will be 
no gay gypsy atmosphere, no co­
lossal musical show, and even the 
one dance will lose its festive 
quality.
To those who believe in “schol­
arship, always first.” Spring Car­
nival weekend will be long 
enough before final exams to al­
low all students to take the week­
end off, forget the books, and en­
joy a real collegiate festival.
All servicemen who listened to 
the best in entertainment from the 
Philippines to Germany and saw 
the glorious week-ends at other 
schools all over the country will 
find Spring Carnival as good as 
they come.
For all the married men, it will 
be the perfect chance to show 
their wives campus life at its best. 
This is the big chance for Tech 
students to show their spirit by a 
big turn-out at the polls and an 
overwhelming “yes” for Spring 
Carnival.
Technical Elects 
Two New Editors
As a result of the elections held 
by the editorial board of the Car­
negie Technical on the 4th of 
January, John Bolton, Manage­
ment Engineering sophomore, and 
Robert Siegel, Physics' sophomore, 
have been elected to positions of 
Fixed and Flexible Copy editors 
respectively.
These positions have been in­
cluded in the editorial board of 
the magazine as a result of recent 
constitutional changes. Other ap­
pointments made by the editorial 
board are: Herman John, Philip 
Bimbaum, and Herbert Herz to 
positions as Article editors. The 
Technical draftsmen are Walter 
Ambrose, Purvis Nettletom, Carlo 
Martino, and William Knightly.

sistants went to Ralph Berkowitz, 
William Burke, Raymond Chap- 
pel, William Cohen, Richard Cut- 
hosky, Lee Daniels, Richard Esch- 
enbach, Marvin Gustavson, Calvin 
Kapp, Robert McKelvey, Vernon 
Neubert, M. Gayle Sorenson, and 
Dale Wright.
Attached to the staff as Busi­
ness assistants were Anthony 
Chirico, William Clarke, Henry 
Puchleitner, James Williams, 
David Sapper, and Richard Burke.
As a reward for his services to 
the Carnegie Technical as Manag­
ing Editor during which time he 
succeeded in obtaining technical 
type for the printing of difficult 
articles and in raising the stand­
ard of the quality in the drawings 
used in ithe magazine, Frank H. 
Maskiell was recommended for a 
gold jewelled key. This recom­
mendation was accepted at the 
last meeting of Student Council.
Mr. Maskiell, who is graduating 
with a degree in Electrical En­
gineering at the conclusion of this 
semester, has, in addition to his 
service to the Technical, been of 
assistance to the staffs of all the 
other campus publications, has 
been an officer in the Kiltie Band, 
and was recently tapped for Eta 
Kappa Nu, Electrical Engineering 
honorary.

TUESDAY, JANUARY 14, 1947THE CARNEGIE TARTAN6
Tartan Five Scares W. & J., 38-58
ORCHIDS AND ANDYLINES
By Andy Cantini
On Wednesday January 8th at 8:30 p. m. a basketball game started 
between the Panthers of the University of Pittsburgh and the home 
team, Carnegie Tech. By 10:30, any similarity between what the
spectators came to see and what actually happened was strictly coin­
cidental. The unorthodox Pitt rushing defense had the team baffled, 
and as a result our team resembled more a junior high school team 
than a college aggregation.
Saturday the Highly touted 
Presidents of W. & J. came to 
town, and we expected another 
rout. But either our boys had not 
read the Prexies’ press notices or 
the visitors were relying too much 
on Tech’s poor record. Conse­
quently, for two quarters an in­
spired Tartan team made us all 
proud by putting on a sterling ex­
hibition that deflated the W. & J. 
ego. The final score is of no con­
sequence, but the performance is 
indicative of the dormant Tech 
power. In the opinion of this 
writer, the team is definitely on 
the upswing.
New Blood
The next semester may furnish a 
few surprises to the loyal Tech 
followers. Leo Clougherty and 
Mike Theodore, two outstanding 
performers of the ’44-’45 combine, 
will return to the hardwood.
Clougherty, a diminutive forward, 
was the leading playmaker; and 
Theodore, a six-foot powerhouse, 
the top scorer of a team that 
boasts a creditable record. The in­
fusion of these two into the line­
up will better than make up for 
Coach Donohoe’s recent loss of 
Marck, Levy, and Katsefanos.
Marck was forced to the sidelines 
because of a leg injury, while 
Levy and Katsefanos were forced 
to abandon the sport because of 
scholastic difficulties.
PLAYER-OF-THE-WEEK: The 
bleak performance of all Tech 
athletes during the past month 
has retarded the growth of the 
old orchid patch, but this week we 
find a new crop seeking recogni­
tion—the swimming team. Each 
and every participant should be 
commended, but I would like to 
single out one member—Kerwin 
“Spinks” Spangler, who led the 
rout over Western Reserve by 
taking two first places. “Spinks,” 
co-captain of the team, hails from 
York, Pa., and is a senior in the 
department of aristocracy — the 
Printing department (plug).
Spangler is this week’s choice not 
only because of his athletic abil­
ity, but also because he will soon 
step into the printing industry, 
and perhaps talk the “old man” 
into eliminating me from the ex­
clusive “52-20” club when I de­
part from the Sterling, Hlasta, 
and Co.
Rifle Team Starts 
Matches in February
Another pre-war sport has 
been reactivated on the Tech cam­
pus with official recognition be­
ing given to the varsity rifle team. 
Coach Sgt. Daehnke, of the 
ROTC, promises plenty of action 
for all aspiring sharpshooters — 
veterans take note—who are in­
terested in joining the squad. In 
addition to the scheduled intercol­
legiate matches in February, 
forty-five postal matches are 
planned for the season.
All students interested in try­
ing out for the team are asked 
to contact either Ed Friedman or 
Sgt. Daehnke at the ROTC office.
AFTERNOON BOWLING 
FOR STUDENTS
University
Recreation Alleys
76 PERFECT ALLEYS
407 S. Craig St. MA. 2998
Intramural
Roundup
This past week found plenty of 
action at the University Alleys as 
the Spare and Strike Leagues took 
to the lanes with the pins aflying. 
When all the pins were put back 
in place the results showed a first 
place tie in both leagues. The 
Dorm Combine beaten twice by 
the ATO’s are now tied with the 
T. N. T. with 9 wins and 3 losses. 
The Tau Delts by winning three 
games are tied with the Betas, as 
each have a record of 7 and 2. 
Handball Finals
Roger Wiewel and Jim Taylor 
will meet this Thursday in the 
gym for the handball singles title. 
In the semi-final last week Wie- 
we beat Dietrich easily 21-17, 
21-2 while Taylor took Elmer 
Nordin twice 21-14.
Table Tennis
The play-off games between the 
Skibo, Plaid, and Schenley title 
winners are scheduled to be play­
ed this week. The FPHA will play 
the Tau Delts, and the winner will 
play the SAE’s.
The results of the finals in the 
table tennis singles turned out to 
be an easy affair for Gordon 
Holmes who needed only three 
games to beat Joe Duroux by 
scores of 21-14, 21-18, and 21-16. 
Foul Shooting
Tomorrow at 4:30 the finals will 
be held in the foul-shooting con­
test with five teams and nine in­
dividuals participating. The Tau 
Delts with 167 out of a possible 
250 are leading the teams, while 
the Beta Sigs are running a close 
second with 161. Buddy Yorkin 
of the Tau Delts topped the in­
dividual contest v/ith 42 out of 
50.
Women Athletes 
Receive Blazers
The Women’s Athletic Associa­
tion has made its post-war recon­
version. This year blazers will be 
awarded instead of the baggy 
gray sweaters used during the 
war.
During the war it was impossi­
ble to get any more appropriate 
award; but now blazers, the usual 
athletic award at girls’ schools 
all over the country, are again 
available in quantity.
The Carnegie Tech jacket will 
be unusual, however, since it will 
be forest green piped in the Car­
negie Cameron of Erracht plaid. 
The pocket will bear the Carne­
gie “C” in place of the college 
seal.
The blazer will be the top 
award of the W. A. A., represent­
ing 150 hours of extracurricular 
activity in athletics. Other awards 
are numerals in Cameron plaid 
for 30 hours participation and a 
“C” for 100 hours. Winners of 
tournaments in tennis, badminton, 
and table tennis receive pins in­
scribed with “W. A. A.”
At present the scheduled activi­
ties are as follows: badminton 
doubles, Tuesday at 2:30 and 3:30, 
and Thursday, 2:30; badminton 
singles, Wednesday, 1:30 and 
Thursday, 3:30 and 4:30; basket­
ball, Monday, 4:30' and Friday, 
4:30; and volleyball, Tuesday, 
12:30 and Wednesday, 3:30.

Skibo Swimmers Win Opener 
With Western Reserve, 53-22
Coach Risedorph’s Carnegie Tech swimming team cast a ray of 
light on an otherwise dismal post war sporting picture as they cap­
tured CIT’s first athletic victory of the new year. Displaying power 
that should be capable of taking many a strong team into camp, they 
splashed all over the Western Reserve tanksters by a score of 53-22 
at the Tech pool last Saturday afternoon.
With co-captains Herb Venzer and Kerwin Spangler leading the 
way the contest was never close, 
as the team garnered 7 of a pos­
sible 9 first places, Spangler was 
tops with two firsts followed by 
Venzer, Lee, Burke, and Fergu­
son with one win apiece.
Tech Takes 300 Yard Relay 
Tech got off to a good start as 
Burke, Lucey, and Venzer team­
ed up to take the 300 yard med­
ley relay by a length in the com­
mendable time of 3:24 minutes.
This was followed by Spangler’s 
first win in the 220-yard free­
style, with Pearlstein of Tech 
grabbing third place. Venzer came 
back after not extending himself 
in the relay to take the 50-yard 
freestyle going away. McMullen 
followed him to complete the one- 
two punch for the Tartans.
In the fancy diving the re­
liable Stu Lee continued his mas­
tery as he beat off Reserve’s Sears 
to win in a close contest. Patter­
son of Tech was third to give 
Tech a comfortable lead in the 
first 4 contests.
Burke Places First
The visitors finally asserted 
themselves as Clark bested a 
slightly tired Venzer to take the 
honors in the 100-yard freestyle.
Tech continued their point getting 
though as Denfield grabbed off 
the third place. The Skibo one- 
two punch came back in the 150- 
yard backstroke as Burke repeat­
ed his fine performance of the 
medley relay to take first place 
and Schroeder followed closely in 
the second spot. The mastery con­
tinued as Ferguson and Zoller 
teamed up to take the 200-yard 
breast stroke, and Spangler and 
Pearlstein won the 440-yard free­
style. When the Reserve team won 
the 400-yard freestyle relay, there 
was no longer any doubt as to the 
outcome, and it was more or less 
an anti-climax.
Slippery Rock Next Week 
Next week the Plaid swimmers 
have their work cut out for them 
as they have two meets sched­
uled. On Wednesday they journey 
to Slippery Rock for what prom­
ises to be their first real test of 
the season. Last Saturday Slip­
pery Rock also won as they beat 
Buffalo by the impressive score 
of 64-11. Judging from the com­
parative times of the two meets, 
it promises to be a whale of a bat­
tle with Tech slightly favored to 
win.
Locals Trounced 
By Pitt, 60-22
The efforts of the Skibo basket­
ball team hit a new low last Wed­
nesday night as the team fell 
apart at the seams to absorb a 60- 
22 drubbing at the hands of the 
Pitt Panthers. For the Plaid it 
was a matter of not being able to 
find the location of the basket; 
for the Panthers it was just a 
matter of time until their coach, 
Dr. Carlson, fathomed a tough 
Tech defense. Once that had been 
accomplished it was just a con­
test to see how many points the 
visitors could make. And they 
managed to make quite a few be­
fore the night was over.
Panthers Break Fast 
The Panthers started off fast as 
Dodo Canterna sank a foul and 
had rolled up six points before 
Tech finally clicked on a long set 
shot by Tasso Katsellas. This was 
followed by a foul shot by George 
Meyers after which Pitt took over 
again with six more points before 
Luther ended the quarter with a 
two pointer. During all this time 
the visitors fast break was work­
ing to perfection, and it was only 
the stellar play of George Meyers 
under their backboard which kept 
the score from being worse than 
it was*.
During the second quarter the 
Tech zone defense tightened un­
der the basket and the Pitt fast 
break was repeatedly stymied. 
Sammy David caught fire for the 
visitors and scored 8 points in 
addition to being all over the 
floor: The half ended with Pitt 
in the lead by a score of 26 to 10. 
Tartans Routed
After the intermission they 
started shooting from the outside 
instead of trying to penetrate the 
stout Tech defense and the game 
was immediately turned into a 
rout. With Pitt scoring at will 
and their rushing defense com­
pletely befuddling the Tech of­
fense, it was no contest.
Katselas, Chetlin and Culbert­
son led the scoring for Tech with 
4 points apiece while Apple led 
the visitors with 19. George 
Meyers played a wonderful game 
for the Skibos throughout as he 
consistently controlled the back­
boards. Klein was also a thorn in 
the visitors side with his hustle 
and good defen^ve play and pro- 
fessional-like acting.
With a valiant but vain effort 
the hapless Tartan quintet drop­
ped its sixth straight game last 
Saturday night when the unde­
feated Presidents of Washington 
and Jefferson invaded the Skibo 
gym to take home a neatly tied 
up 58-38 victory. j
Coach Donohoe’s boys held the 
visitors in check for three out of 
four quarters, but in the third 
stanza the defense crumbled and 
the offense disintegrated as the 
Presidents, paced by sharpshoot­
ers, Hank Knoche and Tommy 
Osso, split the Tartan hoop for 
20 points while two fouls and a 
field goal by little Marty Chetlin 
presented the total Tartan effort. 
Katselas Hot
Tasso Katselas kept the Presi­
dents worried throughout the first 
half as he found the range for 
four long shots and as many char­
ities. W. & J. found themselves 
trailing three times in the open­
ing quarter, and the score was 
even on five different occasions in 
the first half.
Tommy Culbertson put the Ski­
bos in the lead in the opening sec­
onds when he collected a charity 
point. W. & J. came back as For- 
quer collected two points and Os­
so made a foul. Then for a minute 
it looked as if this was the night 
for the team to break its losing 
streak. Mel Klein tied it up at 
three all, Katselas tacked on two 
charities and the first of his ra­
dar shots, and the score board 
read 7-3.
See-Saw Battle 
Osso and Knoche got hot, tied 
the score at 9-9, and from then on 
it was nip and tuck until at the 
end of the quarter, W. & J. had 
a two-point margin.
With the count 16-14 at the 
opening of the second period Paul 
Kuzma and Tas Katselas collect­
ed a charity apiece. Then Katselas 
rang the bell to put the Skibos 
ahead for the third and last time. 
Knoche struck twice, Joe Luth­
er evened it up for the home team, 
but Knoche struck again to make 
it 22-20. The Tartan captain call­
ed time, but it was too late. W. & 
J. had the lead and held it at half 
time when the score read 26-22. 
Tartans Fold «
The second half was a sadder 
story. The Presidents put the 
muzzle on Katselas, while Tom­
my Osso romped down the floor 
for four field goals. The Tartans 
lost their fight, and at the end of 
the third period they were trail­
ing 46-26. The fourth quarter was 
even, but after falling off the 
pace at the beginning of the sec­
ond half, Carnegie Tech was des­
tined to chalk up another in the 
minus column.
Wednesday night the local team 
will play host to the Case School, 
and on Saturday they will meet 
Penn State in the gym. The Skibos 
are rated a good chance to win 
over Case, and a fighting chance 
against State.

Weary Evening Students Offered 
Chance for Refreshing Dip In Pool
Am. Lit. Course 
Holds Interest
With the close of the first se­
mester and re-registration of 
Evening classes drawing near, 
there will be many casting about 
for new classes to add to their 
schedules. Although the usual 
schedule of classes extends over 
an entire year, there are still 
quite a few courses which may 
be completed in a single semes­
ter, or begun in the middle of 
the year, and one of these is the 
course offered in American lit­
erature.
This survey, for that word is 
most apropos in describing the 
course, covers literature, both 
prose and poetry, in the United 
States dating from the first ac­
count of the English colonies in 
América by Captain John Smith, 
to the present day figures in the 
literary field.
Dr. Goodfellow, who teaches 
this class, is well qualified as an 
American literature instructor, 
having majored in English at Har­
vard and Colgate preceding his 
eighteen years with Carnegie 
Tech. His own personal interest 
in literature makes the class en­
tertaining and educational. In the 
course he presents a brief im­
pression of all of the most out­
standing literary figures and ex­
amples of their theories and style 
in Writing.
For those who fear any class 
that is even second cousin to an 
English course may be added the 
reassurance that there is no writ­
ing expected, but for the occasion­
al quiz or term paper. Most of 
the information derived in class 
is in the form of lectures which 
Dr. Goodfellow skillfully camou­
flages with maps, pictures, and 
extra reading, making the class 
hours pass quickly.
The American literature class 
meets Monday and Friday from 
8:30 until 10:00, and for anyone 
desiring extra credits and a 
course that will prove interesting 
and culturally beneficial, this 
class can be readily recommended. 
Since American literature is be­
ing offered for the first time this 
year, its continuation depends 
highly upon its success. Beipg 
newly established on the curric­
ulum, there is a reasonaoie chance 
that there will still be openings for 
¦any student who is interested. 
One would do well to schedule 
this course this semester or the 
following term.Open Minds

T
ELEPHONE men are hard at work 
extending and improving telephone 
service in rural areas served by the 
Bell Companies. They’re pushing a 
$ 100,000,000 three to five year program 
to give telephone service to all who want 
it just as fast as possible.
To do this they had to look beyond 
conventional telephone practices. New 
techniques and new and improved equip­
ment had to be planned, developed and
proved. Now they are furnishing tele-« 
phone service over rural power lines, over 
new steel wire that requires fewer poles 
per mile, over insulated wire that can be 
buried directly in the ground and by 
means of rural radio.
Men who approach every problem with 
open minds... who are guided by inge­
nuity and resourcefulness rather than by 
established method... find telephony an 
ever stimulating and interesting career.
Drama Dept. Gives 
The Three Sisters
The Drama department of Car­
negie Institute of Technology is 
currently giving the play The 
Three Sisters by Anton Chekov. 
Performances will be given 
through Wednesday, January 22, 
except Saturday and Sunday, Jan­
uary 18 and 19.
The setting of this drama is a 
small Russian village in the early 
1800’s which is well portrayed by 
the’excellently designed and ex­
ecuted scenery. This offering, as 
those of the past, is expected to 
be one of superior interest and 
quality.
Tommy Carlyn To Be Featured

How do you like this set up, students? Tommy Carlyn’s lorchestra 
will be the attraction for our next evening school social affair scheduled 
for Saturday night, February 22, in Thistle hall. Assessment will be 
$1.00 per person. Not bad, do you think? Pass around the word to 
the gang and let’s talk this dance up.
Those who attended the last dance can attest to the success of the 
affair. At the Student council meeting in December, the Thanksgiving

Exams Scheduled 
For Jan. 22-28
We know that this announce­
ment may not be welcomed by 
many of you, but Evening School 
final examinations have been 
scheduled from Wednesday, Jan­
uary 22, through Tuesday, Janu­
ary 28. Evening School registra­
tion for the second semester will 
be held on Thursday and Friday, 
January 30 and 31, from 6:30 p. m. 
to 9:30 p. m. The gymnasium, as 
in former years, will be used for 
registration. Unfortunately, no 
vacation days are listed between 
semesters, for classes resume on 
Monday, February 3.
Beginning classes in the College 
of Engineering and Science will 
be offered in algebra, general 
chemistry, and physics. Under 
general studies, elementary 
courses in psychology, English, 
and economics will be offered.
dance was given the “once-over” 
and all of its features, both fav­
orable and unfavorable, were dis­
cussed pro and con. It was decided 
that one of the objections, few 
though they were, to the Novem­
ber dance was the orchestra. It is 
needless to say that with Tommy 
Carlyn providing music for our 
February dance that “he who ob­
jects may object to himself, 
alone.” The record this orchestra 
has created and maintained in the 
Pittsburgh district is well-known 
by all followers of the “light fan­
tastic,” and little mention need 
be made of their talent.
Several other items were men­
tioned at the Council meeting in 
regard to the dance. One of these
was the fact that too many of 
those in attendance did not mingle 
with the crowd. Plans now in­
clude a novelty dance to avoid 
this occurrence again. A commit­
tee is formulating their ideas for 
decorations of outstanding calibre; 
and with the crystal ball as a 
central theme, an atmosphere of 
sociability and “dance-ability” is 
sure to prevail throughout the 
evening.
Once again—February 22 for the 
George Washington dance spon­
sored by your Evening Student 
council. It may still be quite a 
few weeks away, but the early 
bird is sure to have the fun—and 
the date.
