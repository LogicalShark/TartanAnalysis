University students and faculty members en-
gaged in an open discussion about their experi-
ences with race issues last Tuesday, Feb. 28, at 
State of the University: Race at CMU. The dis-
cussion was organized by housing community 
advisors and the Of?ce of Residential Education.
The event began with senior math major 
Connie Yang discussing the de?nition of racial 
stereotyping. She read that stereotyping is de-
?ned as “a way for the mind to make sense of 
the complexities of the world around us, a way 
for the mind to make complex things more un-
derstandable.” But this can become a problem 
when all characteristics of group are attributed 
to one individual. Yang shared many of her ex-
periences with Asian stereotypes such as qui-
etness and skill at schoolwork and math. She 
believes that we need to see people as human 
individuals ?rst. 
Senior electrical and computer engineering 
major Wole Idowu also shared his experiences 
with stereotyping and racism. During his child-
hood, Idowu lived in a variety of places, includ-
ing Washington, D.C., Maryland, and West 
Virginia. “I’ve seen two different things: racism  
and ignorance, and the way I separate it is the 
malice. I’ve been assaulted for being black, and 
I’ve had people who are like ‘I don’t know why 
this offends you, it’s just a joke.’”
Idowu continued, saying, “At [Carnegie Mel-
lon], I see a lot of ignorance. Though segrega-
tion has been gotten rid of of?cially, it hasn’t 
been gotten rid of in levels. High schools aren’t 
really fully integrated and so many people don’t 
have a strong experience interacting with some 
minorities.” He believes that, because of this 
lack of experience, people gain their percep-
tions of cultures from the media and entertain-
ment. Idowu believes he can work with that 
and educate people, but added, “this can be 
very emotionally, physically, mentally draining 
in cases where they don’t have malice but don’t 
want to learn — that’s bigotry.”
Senior history major Robert Stephens agreed 
with Idowu, but also wanted to push back on 
the idea that the oppressed have the responsi-
bility to educate others. “I get it, there is going 
to be ignorance that occurs, there are going to 
be misunderstandings, but at what point does 
the person who has never come into contact 
with ‘the other,’ say, ‘maybe I should try to learn 
more about you.’” However, Stephens wanted 
to emphasize the importance of curiosity. “Cu-
riosity is great, curiosity is how we learn, but 
it’s a very different thing when [people] impose 
the beliefs they already hold on you.” 
Junior psychology major Kanisha Vaughn 
said, “I don’t know how many times I’ve been 
told I’ve lost my ‘black card’, meaning I’m not 
‘black enough’. It frustrates me. Sometimes 
the black community sets certain standards for 
ourselves that are drastically low and we, as a 
people, are so much better than that. It bothers 
me that sometimes we stereotype ourselves and 
turn around and complain that other groups 
put stereotypes on us. Don’t get me wrong, I’m 
also upset with everyone else who is stereotyp-
ing us, but I feel that step one should be under-
standing stereotypes we put on ourselves, and 
[addressing] that.”
The conversation then shifted with a ques-
tion from the audience asking whether the idea 
of “not seeing color” is helpful or destructive. 
Vaughn responded, “I hate that phrase. The 
?rst thing you notice about someone is their ap-
pearance. In my opinion, I don’t see why there 
is a problem with seeing color. This is where 
ignorance and implicit biases come from. You 
should acknowledge color and focus on what 
that means.”
Stephens added that by telling a person you 
don’t see color, you are ignoring their culture 
and experiences. “Our experiences are intrinsi-
cally linked to our color,” he said. “I am a black 
man from the South. A lot of the stuff I’ve ex-
perienced comes from the lens of a black man 
from the South. There are many things that 
have happened to me because I am a black man 
from the South. You just don’t need to make 
color the topic of every conversation.”
The conversation changed to address ques-
tions on how to solve the problem of racism at 
Carnegie Mellon. Junior Kevin Wainczak asked, 
as a white man, how he can help. “I care about 
diversity, I want to support diversity. What can I 
do? What are the things you’d be looking for in 
an ally?” he asked.
Idowu believes being an ally is very impor-
tant. “What I look for is to be able to learn, to 
be honest. It seems like a simple thing. Some 
people don’t want to listen to my struggles. You 
have to be open to listening to people and try to 
empathize with their pain. You might take of-
fense to things, it might get uncomfortable. But 
you being an ally and overcoming that discom-
fort means a lot to the people going through 
these struggles.”
Vaughn, in response to Wainczak’s question 
on how to be an ally, said, “People are afraid 
to make mistakes. People are afraid to say the 
wrong things, do the wrong things and offend 
people. I wish more people would feel comfort-
able to come up to me and say, ‘I don’t know 
how to be respectful to you, I don’t understand 
your culture. Please help me, please teach me.’”

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity has recently welcomed 
Angela Blanton and Cathy 
Light to executive leadership 
positions. “Both Angela and 
Cathy have distinguished 
themselves since last sum-
mer while serving the univer-
sity,” President Subra Suresh 
stated in an email sent to the 
university. Both women have 
formerly worked at the uni-
versity before assuming their 
new positions on March 1. 
Blanton, the former di-
rector of operations in the 
Finance Division, has been a 
member of the Carnegie Mel-
lon staff since 2015. In addi-
tion to being responsible for 
the leadership of university 
business and ?nance func-
tions, she oversees Audit Ser-
vices, the Treasurer’s Of?ce, 
the Controller’s Of?ce, Bud-
get and Financial Planning, 
Procurement, and Business 
Systems and Services. 
Boasting a bachelor's de-
gree in electrical engineering 
from the University of Michi-
gan and an MBA from Carn-
egie Mellon’s Tepper School 
of Business, she began her ca-
reer as an electrical engineer 
with Delphi Automotive and 
Chrysler. Following this, she 
worked at PPG Industries and 
then at PNC Financial Ser-
vices as a ?nance manager. 
Before joining the Carnegie 
Mellon staff, she had worked 
her way up to CFO for PNC 
Financial Services brokerage 
investment business. 
Blanton will now serve as 
the vice president for ?nance 
and chief ?nancial of?cer for 
the university.
Light has served as the 
director of the Of?ce of the 
President at Carnegie Mel-
lon since 2007. She has a 
bachelor's degree in business 
management from Carlow 
University and will earn her 
master’s degree in organiza-
tional leadership from Robert 
Morris University this sum-
mer. Prior to joining Carnegie 
Mellon, Light held a variety of 
management positions with 
the Institute for Shipboard 
Education. Her responsibili-
ties included managing global 
operations, academic ?eld 
programs, budgeting, and risk 
management. Light also com-
pleted Carnegie Mellon’s in-
augural Leadership Academy 
in 2009.
Light will now serve as sec-
retary of the corporation and 
chief of staff. In this capacity, 
she will oversee the Of?ce of 
the President, coordinating 
internal and external stake-
holder interactions, and sup-
port the board of trustees. 
In addition to this, she will 
also serve as the point of con-
tact for various constituent 
groups, planning the Presi-
dent’s and other senior lead-
ers' initiatives relating to in-
ternal operations and global 
external relationships.
President Suresh has ex-
pressed his excitement for the 
promotions stating that both 
women have “brought energy, 
skill, and leadership to these 
critical roles, making strong 
additions to the university’s 
executive team.” 
President Suresh encour-
ages the community to con-
gratulate Blanton and Light 
"for their promotions and 
[thank] them for their leader-
ship and service to Carnegie 
Mellon University.”

President Suresh deliv-
ered his Annual Update this 
past Thursday in the Cohon 
Center's Rangos Hall. The up-
date follows an annual town 
hall held last fall to address 
the needs of the community. 
The 30-minute speech was re-
ceived by hundreds of mem-
bers of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, including faculty, 
students, and alumni. It was 
also live-streamed on the uni-
versity's website.
Suresh was introduced 
by Student Body President 
Vaasavi Unnava who wel-
comed the ninth president 
of Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity. The president began with 
welcoming both the in-person 
and streaming audiences, 
which extended to visiting 
families and parents. 
Recognition and acknowl-
edgments preceded the 
address, with congratula-
tory remarks to outstanding 
members of Carnegie Mel-
lon. Suresh recognized fac-
ulty such as Tepper Profes-
sor Sridhar Tayur for being 
inducted into the National 
Society of Engineering who 
also donated $1 million to-
wards the construction of 
the Tepper Quad, and School 
of Drama Head Peter Cooke 
who was named a member of 
the Order of Australia. Suresh 
then went on to congratulate 
outstanding members of the 
student body. This ranged 
from the hyperloop team per-
sonally working with Elon 
Musk, to Chrystal Thomas, a 
senior in the Mellon College 
of Science, for being awarded 
the Schwarzman Scholarship 
in Beijing, and ?nally bas-
ketball player Lisa Murphy, a 
senior psychology major, for 
making NCAA history. 
The President’s address fo-
cused on three points: ?rst, to 
attract and retain outstanding 
and diverse talent; second, to 
enhance the physical environ-
ment and the Carnegie Mel-
lon experience; and third, to 
build excellence across the 
university. 
In order to attract a diverse 
student body, Carnegie Mel-
lon has targeted its efforts on 
endowment to maximize the 
number of students it can cov-
er through scholarships. With 
the assistance of 450 con-
tributors, a total increase of 
$285 million has been added 
to the endowment since the 
previous year, thus enabling 
225 students to be supported. 
As of December 2016, the uni-
versity’s endowment stands 
at greater than $2 billion, the 
highest in Carnegie Mellon 
history. In fact, the endow-
ment has increased by nearly 
60 percent in just the past 
three years alone. Further aid 
comes from trustees who, just 
this past week, announced a 
$10 million gift to

In his Annual Update, President Suresh identi?ed three focus areas: recruiting diverse and outstanding 
talent, enhancing the Carnegie Mellon experience, and building excellence across all facets of the university.
STATE of theUNIVERSITYRACE AT CMU:

---------------------------------------------------

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s School of Music has 
recently received its largest 
gift since it was founded 105 
years ago.
The $5 million gift, given 
by the late Jack G. Buncher’s 
foundations, is set to estab-
lish the Jack G. Buncher 
Chair for the the head of the 
school. Buncher was recog-
nized for his philanthropy 
and business achievements 
in the Pittsburgh area. This 
chair will help the school to 
attract and retain scholars to 
lead its programs. This pro-
gram is the ?rst of its kind for 
the School of Music.
The gift was supported by 
Bernita Buncher, daughter 
of Jack G. Buncher, and is 
funded by both the Jack 
Buncher Foundation and the 
Jack G. Buncher Charitable 
Fund for Carnegie Mellon 
University. “Carnegie Mellon 
is a jewel in the crown of 
Pittsburgh,” Buncher said 
in a recent press release. 
College of Fine Arts Dean 
Dan Martin expressed the 
School of Music’s deep 
gratitude to Buncher for “her 
commitment to Carnegie 
Mellon and to Pittsburgh” 
and stated that “this historic 
gift will provide the head 
of the School of Music with 
the resources to advance our 
world-renowned program.” 
Buncher has long been a 
supporter of classical music 
and serves as a trustee of 
the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra.
There will be a formal cer-
emony in the fall to celebrate 
the gift and install the head 
of the School of Music.

School of Music receives record-breaking $5 million gift from late alumnus Buncher
Carnegie Mellon announces Jay Whitacre appointed new director of Scott Institute
Effective May 1, Jay  
F. Whitacre will assume 
the role of director of the 
Wilson E. Scott Institute for 
Energy Innovation. He will 
succeed University President-
Emeritus and professor of 
Engineering and Public Policy 
and Civil and Environmental 
Engineering Jared L. Cohon 
as director of the program. 
Currently, Whitacre has a 
joint appointment in the 
departments of Materials 
Science and Engineering 
and Engineering and Public 
Policy.
After earning his Ph.D. in 
Materials Science at the Uni-
versity of Michigan in 1999, 
he served for seven years at 
the Jet Propulsion Laboratory 
as a senior member of the 
technical staff. Then in 2007, 
Whitacre joined Carnegie 
Mellon as an assistant profes-
sor, and recently attained the 
distinction of full professor 
in 2015. His research focuses 
on materials and their capac-
ity for energy storage, and 
in 2009, his lab developed a 
unique battery design with 
non-toxic and non-?ammable 
chemicals that would become 
Aquion Energy, a business 
that Whitacre founded.
In 2014, Whitacre was 
awarded the Caltech/Resn-
ick Sustainability Institute 
Resonate Award, and in 2014 
Fortune Magazine named 
him one of the world’s top 
25 eco-innovators. Addition-
ally, Whitacre won the the 
$500,000 Lemelson-MIT Prize 
for Innovation for developing 
a low-cost, mass-producible 
battery with minimal envi-
ronmental impact.
According the university 
press release, Whitacre’s ap-
pointment marks the begin-
ning of a new era for the Scott 
Institute. The intitute plans to 
implement goals devised un-
der President Cohon’s leader-
ship, placing a larger empha-
sis on creating corporate and 
community relationships.
The Scott Institute was 
founded in 2012 after a gen-
erous donation from Sher-
man Scott (CIT ‘66), presi-
dent and founder of Delmar 
Systems, and his wife, Joyce 
Bowie Scott (CFA ‘65), a uni-
versity trustee.

Death count at 110  due to drought in Somalia
INTERNATIONAL NEWS IN BRIEF
Malaysia forces North Korean ambassador out
PYONGYANG — The 
Malaysian government has 
given North Korea’s am-
bassador 48 hours to leave 
the country after he failed 
to appear at Malaysia’s 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs. 
Ambassador Kang Chol was 
given this request after fail-
ing to apologize for several 
in?ammatory statements 
he made.
After the airport assassi-
nation of Kim Jong-nam on 
Feb. 13, Chol questioned po-
lice ?ndings regarding Kim’s 
assassination. He stated the 
North Korean people should 
not trust the Malaysian po-
lice investigation, which the 
Malaysian Foreign Minister 
denounced.
Sinn Fein nationalist party wins most legislative seats
DUBLIN — After last week’s 
election, Sinn Fein, Northern 
Ireland’s main Catholic 
nationalist party, won 27 
of 90 available posts in the 
Northern Ireland Assembly, 
marking  their highest ever 
number of legislative seats. Its 
protestant rivals,  which hold 
the majority, won 28 seats. 
These results have thrown 
two decades of peaceful 
sharing of power into turmoil, 
forcing these enemies to form 
a new government or return 
to direct rule from Britain. 
This election comes at a time 
of concern over security 
checks along Ireland’s border 
and economic strife after 
Britain’s planned exit from 
the European Union.
MOGADISHU — As of 
March 5, around 110 people 
in Somalia have died from 
famine or diarrhea due to a 
drought in a two-day span. 
The United Nations chil-
dren’s agency UNICEF pre-
dicts that the drought could 
result in up to 270,000  to-
tal children suffering acute 
malnutrition this year due to 
food shortages. In 2011, the 
country also faced a deadly 
famine, which caused the 
mass starvation of nearly 
260,000. “The Somali gov-
ernment will do its best, and 
we urge all Somalis wherev-
er they are to help and save 
the dying Somalis,” Prime 
Minister Hassan Ali Khaire’s 
of?ce said in a statement. 
Syrian army takes villages from Syrian militants
AMMAN — The Syrian 
army has recently made 
progress in the eastern 
Aleppo countryside by 
occupying this territory 
as they push back against 
jihadists, regaining water 
supplies. By taking Islamic 
State territory south of al-
Bab, the army prevents any 
possible move by Turkey 
and rebel groups to expand 
southwards. Advances 
since 2015 by the Syrian 
Democratic Forces have 
pushed the Islamic State 
from the frontier. Islamic 
State’s holdings in northwest 
Syria have been diminished 
over recent months.

STATE, from A1
“‘It all starts with honest 
communication and admit-
ting your ignorance.’”
Another discussion point 
was how the school, faculty, 
and staff can address racism. 
Professor Jelena Kovacevic, 
Head of electrical and 
computer engineering, said 
that when she ?rst came to 
Carnegie Mellon, she had 
been guilty of thinking the 
campus is its own bubble 
without larger problems, 
including racism. “The ?rst 
thing is being aware of it. 
Then you can do something 
about it. You have to open 
up these conversations 
and ask, ‘What can I do to 
make this better?’ The ?rst 
step is ?guring out what’s 
going on. There’s a lot of 
ignorance.”
Assistant Professor 
Daniel Armanios from the 
department of engineering 
and public policy said that 
he has noticed that a lot of 
students feel too vulnerable 
to speak in public. “I cre-
ate an hour outside of class 
where students can come 
and talk about stuff. They 
can vent to me about any-
thing.” Armanios believes 
that if there is an organic 
network of faculty members 
who can open their of?ces, 
more students who don’t 
want to speak in public can 
feel supported to speak up. 
Though he acknowledged 
that many professors do 
not have the time to facili-
tate these conversations, 
Armanios said, “This really 
matters to me, given the 
state of our country as well 
as the world.”
The conversation ended 
on the importance of con-
tinuing to have these dis-
cussions of race, emphasiz-
ing how crucial it is to get 
more people on campus to 
take part in events like this.
The ?nal two State of 
the University events of the 
semester will be conversa-
tions about mental health 
and gender.
UPDATE, from A1
presidential scholars. 
In addition to community 
contributions, external part-
nerships have also blossomed 
into donations intended to 
supplement Carnegie Mellon’s 
outstanding student talent. 
U.S. Department of Defense 
donated $250 million to an 
advanced robotics manufac-
turing institute led by Carn-
egie Mellon. ANSYS donated 
to the university to help fund 
a new building hosting maker 
ecosystems in advanced robot-
ics. The U.S. Department of 
Transportation gave $14 mil-
lion to Mobility21 to improve 
mobility of people and goods 
in the 21st century, and K&L 
Gates donated to allow the 
study of ethics of arti?cial in-
telligence. 
President Suresh then 
shifted to how the administra-
tion is enhancing the Carnegie 
Mellon Experience, which falls 
into two distinct categories: 
?rst, the personal dimension 
which exists in an environ-
ment and infrastructure to live 
our healthy lives, and second, 
the community dimension for 
a united spirit and purpose, 
and ultimately “One CMU.”
Through subgroups like the 
international task force and a 
new host family program, the 
campus has strived to further 
integrate students into one 
community. The internal task 
force comprises of representa-
tives across the Carnegie Mel-
lon community who deliver 
valuable insight to the daily 
lives of students. Meanwhile, 
a new host family program 
has already matched 73 in-
ternational students with 40 
host families in the Pittsburgh 
area. The program’s success is 
only expected to increase over 
time.
There have also been a 
number of new and expand-
ed efforts related to diversity 
including anti-bias training 
sessions, the formation of the 
most diverse senior leadership 
team in our university’s his-
tory, and pipeline programs 
from under-served and under-
represented communities for a 
rigorous higher education. 
Student leaders also hosted 
an open forum a few weeks 
ago to discuss immigration. 
Suresh said that this topic is 
paramount to him in his pro-
fessional experience with 
the historically welcoming 
immigration policies of this 
country.
EVANGELINE LIU
Staffwriter
Alexander Heffner, host 
of the PBS public affairs pro-
gram The Open Mind, spoke 
at Carnegie Mellon about the 
importance of fact-based, in-
dependent journalism and its 
role in preserving a healthy 
democracy. He also spoke to 
the importance of promoting 
a “more civil discourse” in to-
day’s polarized world.
“It’s not good enough any-
more to be neutral or factual 
[in journalism],” Heffner said 
during his talk. Instead, he 
views journalism as his fore-
most duty to “promote civil-
ity on the airways” and open 
up a meaningful, substance-
based dialogue between dif-
ferent people who may have a 
lot of disagreement with each 
other. He states that civility 
is a prerequisite for opening 
up a fact-based discourse. 
This is because the incivility 
of bigotry tends to lead to ob-
struction and gridlock, which 
in extreme form leads to dys-
function. He cites the example 
of the obstructionist agenda 
that manifested in Washing-
ton after the Tea Party election 
victories of 2010. He associ-
ates the sti?ing of free think-
ing resulting from having a 
bigoted attitude as a “perpet-
ual state of paralysis.”
Given that a lot of issues 
today are not addressed with 
the proper level of civility 
that is required to have a 
meaningful discussion about 
them, Heffner makes it his 
goal for The Open Mind to be a 
space for this needed respect.
Heffner says that every-
one should practice civility in 
both their real and online lives 
so that it does not disappear 
as in, for instance, Trump’s 
tweets. He used these tweets 
as a prominent example of 
behaving uncivilly. Practicing 
civility means being deliberate 
about our actions, just as he is 
deliberate about only invit-
ing guests onto his show who 
meet a certain criteria for be-
having in a respectful manner. 
However, being deliberate is 
more dif?cult because of to-
day’s culture, whether you’re 
a professional journalist, stu-
dent journalist, or a citizen. 
He believes that empathizing 
with other people is essential, 
even when they disagree with  
your views.
During his talk, Heffner 
also gave some commentary on 
President Trump. According to 
Heffner, Trump understands 
that the viral spread of fake 
news stories delegitimized the 
election in the minds of many, 
and, as a result, Trump turns 
around and throws the “fake 
news” label at journalists 
from well-established media 
outlets that are giving him 
negative coverage. Heffner 
also reiterated that we cannot 
underestimate the power that 
free media coverage during 
the election gave Trump, 
which, combined with the 
small seeds of truth that are in 
many of Trump’s statements, 
won over many swing state 
voters.
This connects to the other 
theme of his lecture: the re-
sponsibility of professional 
journalism and what he saw as 
the shortcomings of the media 
coverage during the election 
cycle.
Heffner acknowledged that 
those in the media have been 
“under some scrutiny, you 
might say politely, and up un-
til Inauguration Day deserv-
edly so.” Heffner questioned 
whether there was enough 
rigorous dialogue about social 
issues relevant to the presi-
dency during the election, or 
if many journalists instead at-
tempted to appeal to what he 
termed the “lowest common 
denominator” when cover-
ing the campaign, including 
during nationally televised 
debates. He gave the example 
of CNN, which went live to 
Trump rallies so often that it 
consisted of the bulk of the 
Trump camp’s election cover-
age. He felt that the “news di-
vision was covering Trump as 
paparazzi.” The 24-hour cable 
news culture, combined with 
the truncation of informa-
tion we consume, were what 
he termed “a toxic mix” that 
threatens a free society.
Thus, he said, independent 
editorial control on media 
outlets is ever more critical 
now. This is also the reason 
journalists cannot and should 
not be concerned with how 
many views or likes they get 
on Facebook, Twitter, and 
other social media outlets, for 
what goes viral is often fake. 
He said we need to “acceler-
ate” both truth and autonomy 
in the media to counter this 
culture of fake news by not be-
ing subject to the temptations 
of clickbait or viral stories. In 
other words, journalists must 
stay independent of the ?ction 
and circus-like atmosphere 
that permeated the campaign.
That being said, Heffner 
does believe that the media is 
doing a better job at standing 
up to Trump now. In answer-
ing an audience member’s 
question, he referred to Scott 
Pelley, the anchor of CBS Eve-
ning News, and Jake Tapper, a 
CNN White House correspon-
dent, comparing them to the 
late Walter Cronkite, a broad-
cast journalist dubbed “the 
most trusted man in America.” 
“Scott Pelley has sounded 
more like Cronkite in recent 
days, calling a lie a lie. Simi-
larly, Jake Tapper has been 
standing up to [the lies of 
the administration],” Heffner 
said.
In today’s culture, Heffner 
said that journalists “must 
have a grasp of [the] values,” 
put into practice when report-
ing the news.
As for what undergraduate 
students could do in this 
context, Heffner told The 
Tartan that he believes “[one] 
has to ?nd an opportunity as 
a young person to channel 
[one’s] energy constructively. 
For some people that might 
be civil disobedience, for some 
people that might be reporting 
news and information, for 
some people that might be 
volunteerism. But you have 
ample opportunity to ?nd 
your passion.”

President Trump 
has taken the rela-
tionship between 
the White House 
and the press to the 
next level. Last Fri-
day, during an infor-
mal press brie?ng, 
the White House 
blocked a number 
of news organiza-
tions from attend-
ing, including The 
New York Times, 
Politico, the Los An-
geles Times, CNN, 
and Buzzfeed. These 
news organiza-
tions are those that 
have been the most 
critical of President 
Trump throughout 
his political career. It 
is telling, then, that 
the White House 
did allow conserva-
tive-leaning news 
sources, includ-
ing Fox News, One 
America News Net-
work, Breitbart, and 
the Washington Times, 
to cover the brie?ng. 
The approved list also included CBS, 
NBC, ABC, the Wall Street Journal, 
and Bloomberg. The Associated 
Press and Time were invited, but de-
clined the invitation in protest.
The relationship between 
the president and the press has 
always been a tumultuous one. As 
the main link between the White 
House and the public, the media 
holds a tremendous power over the 
perception of U.S. citizens, a power 
that has worked both for and against 
every president. Gerald Ford’s klutzy 
reputation was given to him by The 
Washington Post with a front-page 
picture of Ford falling while walking 
down the steps of Air Force One 
on a trip to Austria. Even George 
Washington, a generally beloved 
president, worried that his famous 
Farewell Address would not be 
properly covered by the press.
Trump’s decision is only his lat-
est attack in an ongoing battle with 
the liberal-leaning press. On Feb. 17, 
he publicly discredited a number of 
renowned news sources, tweeting 
“The FAKE NEWS media (failing                   
@nytimes, @NBCNews, @ABC,             
@CBS, @CNN) is not my enemy, it is 
the enemy of the American People!” 
While on the campaign trail, 
he revoked press credentials from 
Buzzfeed, Politico, Univision, the 
Huf?ngton Post, and The Washington 
Post, preventing those news organi-
zations from getting press access at 
rallies and blocking them from press 
conferences. 
These are news sources that have 
not been kind to Trump in their pub-
lications and broadcasts, and he has 
made it quite clear that he will not be 
kind to media sources that paint him 
in a more critical light.
The press, however, is a crucial 
player in the American political pro-
cess. There is a very good reason that 
freedom of press is clearly laid out 
in the First Amendment—the press 
keeps the government in check. 
Newspapers and news stations are 
the link between the public and the 
president, and attempt to add some 
transparency to a government that is 
often run behind closed doors.
They hold the president account-
able for his actions, and give the 
public an option to have an opinion.
This is why there is a press corps at 
the White House, why the press must 
know where the President is at all 
times, and why there are presidential 
press brie?ngs almost every day. 
U.S. citizens need to be able to see 
a glimpse of what happens behind 
the carefully guarded doors of the 
White House.
Of course, President Trump does 
not seem to like being put in check by 
any person or piece of information. 
The news cycle has been littered 
with Trump’s ignorance and made-
up facts and ?gures. From the 
fabricated Bowling Green massacre, 
courtesy of Trump advisor Kellyanne 
Conway, to his hiring of climate 
change skeptic Scott Pruitt to head 
the EPA, to his multitude of sexist 
and racist comments, Trump has 
made himself quite easy to criticize.
Now, every other President has 
been slammed by the press at one 
time or another. America has lived 
through presidents committing adul-
tery, making backroom deals, and 
leading us into a variety of unwar-
ranted international con?icts. What 
sets Trump apart is his retaliation, 
largely over social media. 
Whereas the media biases of oth-
er presidents have been assumed, 
but usually not outwardly con-
?rmed, Trump has made it very clear 
that he only supports media outlets 
that support him. 
The New York Times, for example, 
is a publication that has been around 
since 1851, has won 119 Pulitzer 
Prizes, more than any other news-
paper, and is the second-largest 
newspaper in the country in terms of 
circulation — to call it “fake news” is 
rather farfetched. But to Trump, the 
fact that the Times criticized him dis-
credits over onr hundred and sixty 
years of highly praised reporting.
What Trump doesn’t seem to real-
ize is that as long as partisan politics 
exists, so too will partisan media. As 
long as conservatives exist, there will 
be news services tailored to conser-
vative tastes, and as long as liberals 
exist, there will be news services tai-
lored to liberal tastes. It’s a business 
–—news sources need to promote 
news that their target audience will 
consume. 
Of course The Times will not typi-
cally support Trump, just like Fox 
News rarely supported President 
Obama when he was in of?ce. The 
extreme bipartisan nature of our 
democratic system as it stands now 
means that at any given time, ap-
proximately half of the country dis-
agrees with the White House, and 
that carries into the media. To a cer-
tain extent, however, these extreme-
ly divided sides keep each other in 
check. Where we have Breitbart and 
Drudge Report making wild claims 
on the conservative side, we have 
the Daily Kos and US Uncut making 
wild claims on the liberal side. If cov-
erage of a news event seems a little 
biased in favor of conservatives on 
FOX News, a viewer can turn on MS-
NBC and see the same story biased in 
favor of liberals. 
Being able to see and hear both 
sides of the argument across the 
liberal–conservative spectrum is 
crucial to understanding the views of 
the public that consumes this media. 
If the media only mirrored one side 
of the debate, which is what Trump 
seems to want, the voices of half of 
the country would be silenced.
The scary thing here is how 
childishly Trump acts with the half 
of the country that disagrees with 
him. By shutting out liberal media, 
he is shutting out the voices of half 
of his constituents and surrounding 
himself with yes men, and that seems 
to be the way he wants it. 
But Trump is no longer a private 
businessman who can simply refuse 
to do business with people that dis-
agree with him. 
He is now the leader of the United 
States, and he presides over a coun-
try of many different people of many 
different political beliefs, a country 
that is currently very divided. Trump 
cannot bridge that divide or appro-
priately represent his constituents 
without hearing the criticism of half 
of the people he represents.
If the press is the voice of the 
public, then Trump is refusing to ac-
knowledge the voices of half of his 
citizens by starting a battle with lib-
eral media. 
Instead of ?ghting his criticis, 
though, he needs to listen to them 
and allow them to have a voice in his 
country. He needs to hear what half 
of the country has to say, and consid-
er that as guidance in leading people 
who disagree with him
No president will ever have the 
full support of the press, and that is 
okay. This country was built upon 
dissenting opinions and being able 
to openly express them. The media is 
essential for this expression. 
Without dissenting voices in 
the media, media itself turns into 
propaganda. In order to be a good 
president and a good leader, Trump 
cannot shut out the press. Rather, he 
must force himself to listen.

Trump’s media blockade violates U.S. citizens’ rights
Tami Tedesco/Staff Artist
Dems need to shore up grassroots support
Editor’s note: Post-Mortem is a 
weekly column that seeks to explain 
the outcome and effects of the 2016 
presidential election. Find previous 
installments @thetartam.org
Though Democrats have a lot 
to mourn from the 2016 election, 
they notched a small electoral vic-
tory last week. The race: a special 
election to ?ll a vacated State Sen-
ate seat in Delaware. Though small 
in stature, the election gained na-
tional exposure because it is one of 
the ?rst elections to take place after 
the races in November 2016, and be-
cause the winner would decide the 
balance of the Delaware State Sen-
ate. This race has a lot to say about 
what Democrats have done wrong 
and what they can do to improve in 
the future.
First of all, we should start with 
the obvious question that should 
make Democrats everywhere want 
to pull their hair out. After former 
Delaware State Senator Bethany 
Hall-Long was elected Lt. Governor 
of Delaware, the balance of the 
Delaware State Senate was up for 
grabs, with both parties holding 
ten seats. So here’s the question: 
why in the world was control of the 
Delaware State Senate ever up for 
grabs in the ?rst place? In 2016, 
Hillary Clinton defeated Trump in 
Delaware by twelve points. Other 
statewide candidates, such as 
those running for Governor and 
Lieutenant Governor, won by nearly 
twenty. In Delaware, which is one 
of the most Democratic states in 
the Union, wouldn’t you expect that 
if 60% of the state’s residents are 
Democrats, then shouldn’t around 
60% of the State Senate also be 
Democrats? This would mean that 
13 of Delaware’s State Senate seats 
would be held by Democrats and 
8 by Republicans. The fact that 
Republicans hold more seats than 
they should is evidence of one the 
Democratic party’s major weakness: 
they have struggled to compete at 
the state and local level, and they 
struggle to succeed even in states 
that should be squarely in their 
corner.
This isn’t just a Delaware prob-
lem. Around the United States, 
Democrats consistently underper-
form expectations in even the bluest 
of states. Ten deep blue states have 
Republican governors, including 
Democratic strongholds like Mas-
sachusetts, Maryland, Illinois, and 
Vermont. Vermont. Like, land of 
Bernie Sanders and Ben and Jerry’s 
Vermont.

Yiannopoulos skews meaning of speech
MADELINE KIM
America prides itself on many 
things, especially freedom. Perhaps 
the epitome of American values lies 
in the First Amendment, which pro-
tects the freedom of speech for all 
Americans. However, with the rise 
of “political correctness”, some fear 
that the First Amendment is under 
attack.
This is where Milo Yiannopoulos 
enters the scene.
Yiannopoulos, a former jour-
nalist of Breitbart News, has found 
himself in the limelight. He is an 
unabashed defender of free speech 
and praises himself as the “Internet 
‘supervillain’”. Yiannopoulos is not 
afraid to offend people; in fact, he 
actually ?nds “delight in offending 
people.” His lack of ?lter and rejec-
tion of progressive values has turned 
him into a tour de force combating 
political correctness and protecting 
the freedom of speech.
Regardless of one’s stance on 
him, it is undeniable that he has 
sparked conversation in American 
society. Some herald him as a martyr 
of free speech, but others see him as 
a threat to democracy. Criticisms 
of the public ?gure have ranged 
from Twitter feuds to protests at the 
University of California, Berkeley.
Yiannoupolus has a tendency to 
call the left and its views a variety 
of insults such as “cancer” and “so-
cial justice warriors.” He continues 
to unabashedly stir up controver-
sies and call out celebrities, which 
famously led to his Twitter account 
being terminated. Although one 
might believe this negative recep-
tion would damage his popularity, 
this attention gave him even more 
support from his followers. It has 
given them more reasons to believe 
there is rise in censorship in Ameri-
can society and has led them to grow 
more defensive as a result.
No matter how adamant Yian-
nopoulos is on knowing the First 
Amendment, it has grown evident 
that he may be overestimating the 
extent to which it protects him.
Yes, Yiannopoulos is correct — 
the First Amendment does grant 
him the freedom of speech. No mat-
ter how controversial or potentially 
detrimental his message may be, he 
has the right to voice his opinions. 
Even his most tendentious words 
are granted the right to be spoken 
“without prohibiting the free exer-
cise thereof; or abridging the free-
dom of speech, or of the press” by 
Congress. 
On the ?ip side, his critics have 
the same right speak back at him. 
This is the way a democracy works: 
by giving each person a voice 
through the First Amendment, peo-
ple within a democratic society can 
keep the government and each oth-
er accountable, ensuring that each 
person has the right to life, liberty, 
and the pursuit of happiness.
Unfortunately, here is where his 
comprehension of the First Amend-
ment falters.
When he announced there was 
an “Orwellian” censorship of the us-
ers on major social media platforms,

Media must award innovation and not fall on safe choices
There is a problem with the 
Oscars. It is not that so-and-so 
should have won this, or someone 
shouldn’t have won that, or even 
that the idea of a ceremony where 
one piece of art is ranked above all 
the rest is fundamentally ?awed 
because the worth of art is entirely 
subjective and depends upon the 
person experiencing that art. The 
real problem with the Oscars stems 
from their branding.
The Academy holds itself up as a 
gatekeeping institution that dictates 
what “good art” (or “good ?lm”) is. 
Trying to de?nitively decide what 
art is valuable or worthy of attention 
is, again, inherently ?awed, but if 
you’re going to set yourself up as an 
arbiter of culture anyway, then you 
are making yourself responsible for 
the cultural zeitgeist, or the 
most prominent cultural 
ideas of a society.
Oscar winners 
are what the 
Academy 
holds 
up 
as 
meaningful art. An institution of 
the Academy’s intended in?uence 
calling something meaningful art 
tells the world that the message of 
that ?lm is worth listening to. Even if 
they did not want to, it is impossible 
for them to pick a ?lm that has no 
message because everything created 
by human hands sends a message.
Art for the simple sake of en-
tertainment and no message has a 
right to exist as much as any other 
art — but the fact is it doesn’t exist 
at all. Even if a ?lm is a stupid com-
edy movie that is just there to make 
people laugh or to make money, that 
?lm still has a message. It’s still say-
ing something. No creator can con-
trol what people think about their 
art — they can try really, really hard, 
but once it’s out in the world it’s out 
of their hands. The author may not 
be dead, and they may even still be 
in?uential, but they aren’t God. The 
only way to control what an audience 
thinks about a piece of art is to never 
give it to an audience. 
The only 
person who 
decides 
what mes-
sage you 
take from 
a ?lm is 
you. (This 
is a moot 
point any-
way, because 
the Academy 
has always 
painted them-
selves as arbiters 
of culture, and thus 
whatever ?lm wins 
Best Picture as cultur-
ally relevant).
The media we consume  
has a signi?cant impacy on who 
we are. Study after study has shown 
that when people who experience 
media with sympathetic portrayals 
of people “different” from them learn 
to empathize more with that group of 
people.
Empathy is a crucial part of how 
we relate to other human beings. 
Bigotry and hate come from a lack 
of understanding and demonization 
of the “other”, but also from a lack 
of empathy. Art that asks us — that 
challenges us — to empathize with 
characters different than the straight, 
white male “default” moves our soci-
ety towards being more empathetic 
and understanding. One ?lm may 
only move us a tiny fraction of step, 
but the more empathetic art we cre-
ate and honor, the closer we get.
The problem with the Oscars is not 
the Best Picture mishap. (Although it 
has had the repercussion of forcing 
Moonlight, a radical ?lm about an ex-
tremely marginalized group, to share 
its stage with La La Land, a ?lm that 
is decidedly not that.) The problem is 
not even that everyone thought La La 
Land was going to win.
The problem is that, based on the 
history of the Oscars, La La Land was 
the best bet. Before this year, ?ve of 
six Best Picture winners in the 2010s 
were movies about ?lmmaking or 
?lmmakers. (The King’s Speech and 
Spotlight were not, technically — but 
both are about public performance 
and art making and are really just gi-
ant metaphors for ?lmmaking, so I’m 
counting them). 
This isn’t really that strange — 
?lmmakers like ?lmmaking, shock-
ingly enough, and I won’t attack 
anyone for liking stories about them-
selves. But if the Academy wants to 
hold themselves up as a bastion of 
culture and ask the millions of people 
who have no investment in ?lmmak-
ing to trust their judgment? 
Well, it’s easy to empathize with 
ourselves or people who are like us. 
What’s hard — what’s crucial — is 
learning to empathize with people 
who aren’t. By holding themselves 
up as an integral institution of cul-
ture, the Academy has made it so 
that, every time they choose a Best 
Picture winner, they are telling the 
world: “This is good art. This is art 
that should be lauded, praised, and 
supported. This is the kind of art we 
should all make more of.” 
I don’t believe that art should 
be safe, careful movies that ask 
audiences to empathize with the 
same people over and over.  Moonlight 
may be the ?rst step in a new era of 
truly culturally relevant Oscars. For 
now, however, it is an exception. 
The hardest thing the Academy 
has asked us to do is empathize with 
its own members — over, and over, 
and over again.

Racial preferences in dating might not always be racist
Editor’s Note: Outcry on Overheard 
is a weekly column about the Facebook 
group Overheard at Carnegie Mellon.
A week ago, people were angered 
by my response to a post on Over-
heard at Carnegie Mellon regarding 
a white college student with a “thing 
for Asian chicks.” Regardless of this 
post’s morality, I felt the need to re-
spond to people crying out racism 
and call them out on their double 
standard. Upon doing so, I received a 
number of messages of people thank-
ing me for sharing a voice less heard, 
even if it meant being destroyed in a 
political bubble. This is the inspira-
tion for my new column, Outcry on 
Overheard.
In this column, I look to express 
opinions less heard on campus and 
bring real debates (not just arti?cial 
ones where you are entirely wrong 
if you do not 100 percent agree with 
another person’s viewpoints). I look 
to also call out the hypocrisy of one-
sided debates.
The controversy of this week re-
gards the “thing for Asian chicks.” Is 
it racism for one’s sexual preferences 
to be racial? Initially, I oversimpli?ed 
my stance to a clear “no”. However, 
after extensive research on the mat-
ter and discovering an endless sea of 
contradictory studies, my conclusion 
is this: it depends. Like most issues, 
staunchly taking one stance or the 
other does not result in a construc-
tive discussion. Responses to my 
comment, like, “your [racial] prefer-
ences are a product of and contribute 
to systematic bias and thus are part 
of systemic racism” oversimplify the 
issue, assume the thoughts of others, 
provide the same destructive type of 
thinking as the mentioned so-called 
systematic racism, and assume that 
we are all society’s prisoners void of 
any free-will in thinking.
The coining of terms like “yel-
low fever” show the commonality of 
white–male, Asian–female couples. 
However, the use of this type of slang 
is a generalization and assumes that 
the root of this racial combination is 
always the male’s desire for the sexu-
al hyper-feminine stereotype painted 
by pornography. Countless studies 
have tried to investigate the com-
monality of this relationship combi-
nation, but each seems to yield differ-
ent results. One study was conducted 
at Columbia, where four hundred 
heterosexual individuals engaged in 
four minute speed dates. The conclu-
sion of this study was that women 
preferred men of their own race, and 
race held no bearing on the women 
that were chosen by men. However, 
East Asian women tended to not dis-
criminate against white men (hold-
ing them at the same level of their 
own race). This neutrality resulted in 
Asian-white being the most common 
interracial couple.
Contrast this with 2014 data from 
OKCupid for DateHookup, in which 
men rate Asian women as 18 percent 
more attractive than the average 
woman and Asian women rate white 
men 19 percent more attractive than 
the average male. In this community, 
there is a clear skew of racial prefer-
ence. Add in contrasting data from 
other studies, and it becomes clear 
that sexual preferences are a deriva-
tive of their community.
The reasons for an individual’s 
sexual preference are as diverse as 
the communities they make up. To 
reduce an entire population’s pref-
erences to the fact that Asian porn 
yields destructive stereotypes is as 
racist as the videos themselves. I will 
not deny the fact that there exist in-
dividuals who have attraction rooted 
from false racial stereotypes. What I 
will deny is the unjust generalization 
of an entire population’s preferences 
to these stereotypes. The subjectiv-
ity of sexual preference is the reason 
why research studies on the matter 
are so complex and often, contradic-
tory. There are so many root causes 
for individual’s upholding of various 
traits that can’t be generalized. Pref-
erence in physical characteristics, a 
culture’s ideals, and a vastly contras-
tive background, as well as bias from 
previous relationships, can all play a 
role in determining one’s attraction 
towards various races.
As Ayn Rand stated, “love is the 
expression of one’s values.” In other 
words, you are attracted to traits in 
individuals that uphold the values 
which you hold the greatest. That 
can be ideas, physical aesthetics, cul-
tures, beliefs, etc. One’s values can be 
rooted in racial bias but to general-
ize this to an entire group of people 
is to hold the same closed-minded 
discrimination as those that are truly 
engaging in “yellow fever”.
However, I would like the take-
away from this column to be some-
thing more than just this Asian–white 
phenomena: issues are often not as 
simple as they seem. By overgener-
alizing either side of an argument, 
you are closing yourself to new ideas. 
I see no greater irony than the fact 
that the university — a symbol of free 
thought and discovery — has become 
a political bubble, where people are 
so afraid of breaking political correct-
ness that they are now afraid to speak 
their minds.

The Social Justice Coalition is 
an organization created to bridge 
the gap between existing organiza-
tions on campus dedicated to social 
change. The Coalition is an alliance 
of campus organizations that aim to 
create effective, systemic culture and 
policy changes on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus. The perceived politically 
apathetic environment on Carnegie 
Mellon’s campus makes it challeng-
ing for the diverse range of student 
organizations concerned with cul-
tural awareness, community service, 
political change to coordinate, and 
mobilize students and their causes. 
These organizations host events 
that are underfunded, poorly 
attended, and often redundant. 
Such efforts suffer due to a lack 
of coordination between groups, 
effectively fracturing a community 
with shared interests. The Social 
Justice Coalition aims to remedy 
this disconnect between campus 
organizations by providing a space 
for open discourse and discussing 
the issues that matter most to the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
The Coalition will work by divid-
ing the organizations into interest 
committees based on the goals of in-
dividual organizations. Committees 
such as Racial and Ethnic Justice, 
Gender and Sexuality, Pittsburgh 
Community, International Develop-
ment, and Civic Engagement and 
Government will allow groups of 
similarly focused organizations to 
specialize while also promoting inter-
sectionality. The Coalition will work 
to bring together a community of en-
gaged organizations in the hopes of 
creating systematic change. Finally, 
the Coalition will work with the ad-
ministration and other organizations 
in and around the Pittsburgh com-
munity to promote conversation and 
political action.
The Social Justice Coalition not 
only offers the opportunity to unite 
existing humanitarian organizations 
to speak in one voice — it also offers 
member organizations the chance 
to foster a true sense of community 
and coordination within Carnegie 
Mellon. 
The Social Justice Coalition would 
serve as the tool with which to imple-
ment these processes. 
The Social Justice Coalition will 
be the foundation on which the fu-
ture Carnegie Mellon community 
will build upon. Students will be able 
to use the Coalition as a facilitator 
and long-term resource to encourage 
healthy debate and concrete change 
in Carnegie Mellon policy. 
By hosting public student forums 
and guest speakers, as well as orga-
nizing campus-wide fundraisers and 
protests, the Coalition will increase 
the ef?cacy of existing organizations 
to spread awareness and spur inquiry. 
For these reasons, the Coalition’s 
most pressing task is to unite cam-
pus organizations in a practical and 
effective way that improves commu-
nication and bolsters support for the 
on-campus social justice community.
Now more than ever, it is neces-
sary to act against the political injus-
tices affecting the Carnegie Mellon 
community. 
Such profound action requires 
determination, a vast array of re-
sources, and the time and effort of a 
devoted, coherent community. 
The Social Justice Coalition will 
build such a community, reducing 
apathy and joining student organi-
zations together. More than any one 
organization before it, the Coalition 
has the potential to truly change the 
minds and hearts of those at Carn-
egie Mellon. Change in the right di-
rection will only come if Carnegie 
Mellon stands together: the Coalition 
is the bond that will keep that unity 
alive.
If you have any questions or would 
like to join the movement, please do 
not hesitate to contact the Chair of 
the Coalition, Iris Stegman. 
She can be reached via email at

Current political climate endangers children, must change
SARAH BENDER
The inconsistent, impulsive power 
that is the Trump administration 
has started creating policies that 
have direct, harmful effects on the 
lives of children, and that is simply 
unacceptable.
On Feb. 22, the administration de-
cided to withdraw the guidelines the 
Obama administration had created 
that allowed transgender students to 
use the bathroom that corresponds 
with their gender identity. According 
to Press Secretary Sean Spicer, Don-
ald Trump believes that how trans-
gender students are treated should 
be a “states’ rights issue.” While the 
guidance documents were not a law 
that compelled states to comply, they 
did invoke the prohibition of sex dis-
crimination in schools as outlined 
in Title IX of the Education Amend-
ments of 1972 to ensure that the civil 
rights of transgender students are 
protected.
Now the decision of which bath-
room these students can use is up 
to the states entirely. This does not 
necessarily mean that the states 
can’t choose to allow them to use 
the bathroom that corresponds with 
their identity, or that discrimination 
will immediately begin to appear. It 
does, however, mean that there is no 
federal standard that ensures their 
protection, or any nationwide re-
percussions for failing to treat them 
with the dignity that fellow human 
beings deserve. The fact that the 
White House is saying that there is a 
choice in this matter sends a shame-
ful and dangerous message to those 
who may want to keep these 
children from being 
themselves in pub-
lic spaces.
Conservatives cite a number 
of reasons for their reluctance to 
allow accommodating bathroom 
policies for transgender people. 
They warn that men, disguised as 
women, could sneak their way into 
women’s bathrooms and harass 
women. Most recently, they claimed 
that they need more time to “further 
and completely consider the legal 
issues involved,” despite the many 
years that protection against sex 
discrimination has already been 
applied to transgender people.
But the vast majority of their 
concerns aren’t based in fact — and 
there are other, proven statistics that 
are far more sobering.
The National Transgender 
Discrimination Survey found that 
41.6 percent of transgender people 
attempt suicide — which is vastly 
higher than the national average 
of 4.6 percent. In 2011, 
the National Center 
of Transgender 
Equality found 
that 82 
percent of 
transgender youth reported feeling 
unsafe at school, with 67 percent 
being bullied online, 64 percent 
having property stolen or destroyed, 
and 44 percent being physically 
abused in some way. With so many 
of these students at real risk, it’s 
clear that serious efforts to establish 
stronger protections are in order. 
But the government continues to fail 
them, choosing instead to cater to 
those who desire conformity.
The disregard for the children 
that rely on the public school system 
continued at the Conservative 
Political Action Conference when 
Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos 
joked that there was “no such thing 
as a free lunch” to an audience of 
activists and elected of?cials.
Devos already has a bad record 
of undervaluing the impact that the 
public school system has on millions 
of children’s lives. In her home state 
of Michigan, she has spoken out 
against public schools and worked 
to expand the prominence of out-
standingly underperforming charter 
schools. 
She also tried to strip teacher 
unions of their in?uence. But the 
fact that the Secretary of Education 
seems unaware of the sheer number 
of children who rely on free school 
lunches across the country is both 
sad and concerning.
In 2014, 19 million children 
received a free lunch from school 
per day, while several million more 
quali?ed for reduced price meals. 
That’s 70 percent of all students who 
eat lunches at school (not including 
those who pack a lunch at home). 
With more than 23 million 
households receiving 
SNAP bene?ts that 
year, some schools 
found that, if a 
meal wasn’t 
offered at 
school 
one day, 
many 
students had no choice but to go 
without eating.
Of course, the money for these 
lunches comes from somewhere. 
But the important detail is where 
it’s going — to children who might 
be relying on the school to provide 
their one substantial meal of the day. 
It’s free for them, which in turn gives 
them the freedom to concentrate on 
their studies, and that makes all the 
difference.
And for DeVos — whose father 
made millions manufacturing auto 
parts and whose husband is heir to 
the Amway fortune — her statement 
isn’t necessarily true either.
Regardless of how states decide to 
shape policies regarding transgender 
students or where the money for free 
lunches is coming from, politicians 
should refrain from targeting the 
dependent, vulnerable youth in the 
country as they work to undermine 
their opponents’ political efforts. 
Innocent children have no place in 
this bitter ideological struggle. They 
should be worried about making 
friends and getting good grades, not 
whether their president and his staff 
are going to take away their right to 
use the bathroom or eat a meal.
These policies create a longer-
term problem as well. If our country’s 
future leaders and thinkers are so 
busy concentrating on a full bladder 
or an empty stomach, are they really 
giving their education the full atten-
tion that it deserves? We need to in-
vest in the future by making sure that 
students are being properly trained to 
make their mark on the world. Rath-
er than having hardship thrown at 
them from yet another side, vulner-
able students need protection from 
discrimination and deprivation, and 
the government should be doing its 
best to offer them safe environments 
where they can learn and grow.

First amendment trivialized by constant misinterpretation
FIRST AMENDMENT, from A4
he demonstrated his lack 
of understanding of what 
the First Amendment truly 
entails. Although freedom of 
speech protects people from 
being persecuted for simply 
speaking their mind, it is not 
equivalent to freedom from 
any and all kinds of conse-
quences.
One such consequence 
was seen recently when he re-
signed from Breitbart News. 
Although there is no exact 
singular cause leading up to 
his resignation, his apparent 
condonation of pedophilia 
de?nitely stirred up emotions 
from not only his usual crit-
ics on the left but also from 
his friends and colleagues at 
Breitbart. For the ?rst time, 
he attempted to apologize for 
his actions — in this case, his 
alleged advocacy for adults 
sexually abusing minors — 
yet the primary focus on his 
apology is the execution of his 
message rather than the fact 
he had expressed the message 
at all. 
Whatever the intentions 
were behind his apology or 
his resignation, Yiannopou-
los avoid responsibility for his 
words by apologizing for the 
reception of his words rather 
than his own actions, and by 
doing so, he cleverly found 
a way to defend himself and 
save the image that a sizable 
number of his supporters 
have painted. 
He claims that his decision 
on resigning was purely his 
own, yet it is dubious as to how 
much the controversy and its 
criticism have contributed.
The First Amendment is a 
critical component of democ-
racy in the United States: it 
ensures fairness in speech by 
granting each person a right 
to speak. However, the First 
Amendment is not some fool-
proof justi?cation for saying 
whatever regardless of its po-
tential consequences, hence 
why one can be punished for 
shouting “?re” in a crowded 
theater or sending threaten-
ing messages. Yes, these are 
extreme examples given, and 
the effect Milo Yiannopoulos 
has had is much more debat-
able. Nonetheless, it is impor-
tant to be aware that by using 
his platform to spread hateful 
speech and falsities, even Yi-
annopoulos should be cogni-
zant of the in?uence he has on 
society and know better than 
to expect no repercussions.
Democrats need local roots
POST-MORTEM, from A4
Vermont, where the 
rivers ?ow with organic, 
non-GMO, locally sourced 
water, and it seems like every 
house is powered by solar 
panels. Vermont having a 
Republican governor should 
be equally as unimaginable 
as Mississippi electing a 
black, lesbian socialist to the 
United States Senate, yet 
Republicans routinely win 
in Vermont and other liberal 
nirvanas. By comparison, 
only four Republican states 
have Democratic governors, 
and that includes Louisiana, 
where the Democratic 
governor barely defeated 
his Republican opponent, 
who was caught up in a 
prostitution scandal. The 
situation is even more dire 
when you account for seats in 
the State Senate and the State 
House of Representatives. 
Around the United States, 
Democrats have trifectas 
— a democratic governor 
and democratic control over 
both chambers — in just 
six states. By comparison, 
Republicans have trifectas in 
twenty-?ve states, including 
typically Democratic states 
like Wisconsin, Michigan, 
and New Hampshire. Of the 
twenty-?ve remaining states 
with joint control, just four are 
typically Republican states, 
and the rest are Democratic 
or swing states. As recently 
as 2009, Democrats exceeded 
Republicans in trifectas, 
with 17 Democratic trifectas 
compared to just 10 for the 
GOP. This all goes to show 
that Democrats don’t compete 
in Republican states, struggle 
to compete in Swing states, 
and don’t even manage to 
defend solid blue states. 
Meanwhile, Republicans have 
their states locked down tight, 
they dominate in swing states, 
and they are surprisingly 
effective in Democratic states. 
Why is this the case? Why 
have Democrats grown so 
bad at winning state and local 
elections? There are a few 
explanations. 
One is just timing and the 
cyclical nature of elections. 
Because the President is by 
far the most visible political 
?gure in the United States, 
the President’s party almost 
always struggles in other 
races up and down the ballot. 
Since a Democrat has been 
president for the past eight 
years, Democrats have seen 
eight years of decline. 
Democrats also face struc-
tural disadvantages. For in-
stance, Republicans receive 
much more ?nancial support 
from industries like oil and 
gas and the ?nancial sector, 
giving them a lot more leeway 
to build their party in non-
republican states.But Repub-
licans have also intentionally 
invested in party building, 
working hard to expand into 
new areas and build up their 
state and local infrastructure. 
While Democrats spent 
years focusing on building 
up their strength in federal 
elections, Republicans pulled 
the rug out from underneath 
them further down the bal-
lot. Republicans better under-
stood that having state and 
local control builds up their 
bench of future candidates 
for federal of?ce. They also 
understood that controlling 
state governments is essen-
tial for redistricting after the 
census, helping them estab-
lish dominance by pushing 
electoral districts out of reach 
for Democrats. And, in the 
age of federal gridlock, they 
also better understood that 
most policy change occurs at 
the state and local level, so 
the best place to push their 
agenda was in that arena. But 
Democrat Stephanie Hanson’s 
victory in Delaware shows 
that the Democratic Party 
might ?nally be waking up to 
the fact that they need to turn 
their attention further down 
the ballot and support the 
party’s efforts at every stage 
of government. 
In this election, the Demo-
cratic Party contributed un-
precedented resources, talent, 
and attention for a race of this 
size. Grassroots progressives 
from around the United States 
also lent their support, donat-
ing over $1 million Hanson’s 
campaign and hosting phone 
banks around the country to 
call Delaware voters on her 
behalf. Democrats might be 
in bad shape nationally, with 
a Republican president until 
2020 at least, a gerryman-
dered House of Representa-
tives, and a god-awful Senate 
map in 2018. But if Democrats 
continue to build the party at 
the grassroots level, win back 
state and local of?ces that are 
rightfully theirs, and get orga-
nized in traditionally Republi-
can areas, they might just be 
able to pull the rug back from 
under the Republicans over 
the next few years.

Earliest evidence of 
life on Earth found in rocks in Canada
The oldest fossil to date 
may have just been unearthed. 
Geologists conducting 
research in Canada came 
across tube cavities in ancient 
haematite that could only 
be left by bacteria. The fossil 
is estimated to be between 
3.5 and 4.2 billion years old, 
almost the age of the 4.5 billion 
year-old Earth. If con?rmed, 
this discovery shows that life 
began on Earth much earlier 
than was previously thought.
Many experts remain 
unconvinced. Much can 
happen in four billion years, 
and some experts believe the 
marks in those rocks could 
be the result of geological 
processes over the epochs.
Those that found the 
fossils believe the features 
of the tubes point directly to 
microbial life. The shape of 
the cavities in the rock closely 
resembles bacteria today that 
grow around hydrothermal 
vents. These bacteria feed 
on nearby iron and grow as 
?laments. At the base of the 
tubes are groves that mirror 
the anchors bacteria use to 
remain attached to rock. 
The researchers argue it is 
impossible for these features 
to be present in the absence 
of life.

New Facebook AI 
detects suicidal users, offers help
Facebook has launched a 
new feature that uses arti?cial 
intelligence (AI) and pattern 
recognition to detect suicidal 
users. Realizing that its users 
tend to show their suicidal 
tendencies online, Facebook 
will put users in immediate 
contact with a mental health 
expert using Facebook Live, its 
video recording feature. A user 
may also ?ag a friend’s posts, 
providing that friend with 
instant help while keeping 
the ?agger in the loop. The AI 
will detect users with mental 
health issues through live 
video feeds. 
The software will use 
data from reported posts to 
determine whether a user is in 
danger. This means help can 
be offered before a user is even 
?agged by a friend. Facebook 
is partnering with the National 
Suicide Prevention Lifeline, 
the National Eating Disorder 
Association, and the Crisis 
Text Line.
Facebook CEO Mark 
Zuckerberg stated “there 
have been terribly tragic 
events — like suicides, some 
live streamed — that perhaps 
could have been prevented if 
someone had realized what 
was happening and reported 
them sooner.”

Continent Zealandia 
discovered under the Paci?c Ocean
Mappings of the south-
western Paci?c Ocean ?oor 
reveal a submerged continent 
under the ocean. Dubbed 
Zealandia, the 1.8 million 
square mile continent is almost 
entirely submerged. New 
Zealand and New Caledonia 
comprise the parts of it that 
rest above the ocean.
The discovery separates 
New Zealand from Australia, 
two land masses that were 
previously thought to be joined 
and referred to collectively as 
Australasia.
This discovery shows 
how little is known about 
the ocean ?oor. Its vastness, 
the incredible pressure, and 
lack of light in its depths 
make it dif?cult to conduct 
meaningful research. 
Powerful radar technology has 
given scientists the ability to 
map the ocean ?oor.
Geologists are not entirely 
sure what event could have 
submerged Zealandia, or 
whether it was ever above sea 
level in the ?rst place.
If Zealnadia were not 
submerged, it would of?cialy 
be the seventh continent 
(Europe is erroneously 
considered  to be the seventh 
continent; however, it is only a 
part of Eurasia). 
Discovery of seven Earth-like planets sheds light on exoplanets
EMMA FLICKINGER
Staffwriter
If there’s one thing 
astronomy has proven over 
and over again throughout 
history, it’s that the Earth is 
less special than we think. The 
Earth is not the center of the 
universe — or even the solar 
system. It’s not unique in its 
size or material composition, 
and it’s not the only planet 
with weather, volcanoes, 
tectonic activity, or liquid 
water.
The only attribute that 
makes our planet one-of-a-
kind is the presence of life. 
Yet, even this might not be 
the case forever. Scientists 
are hoping that last week’s 
announcement of seven Earth-
like planets orbiting the star 
TRAPPIST-1 may put us closer 
than ever to discovering life 
elsewhere in the galaxy. The 
system is relatively close to 
Earth at 39 light-years away.
The planets of TRAPPIST-1 
were discovered by researchers 
from the University of Liège 
in Belgium, con?rmed last 
year, then announced on 
Feb. 22. They were spotted at 
Chile’s La Silla observatory 
using the Transiting Planets 
and Planetesimals Small 
Telescope, or TRAPPIST, 
which became the name-
sake of the star system. The 
planets have no names yet 
because the system follows 
typical exoplanet designation 
conventions where the star is 
referred to as TRAPPIST-1 or 
TRAPPIST-1A, and the planets 
as TRAPPIST-1b, TRAPPIST-
1c, etc., in order from the 
planet closest to the star to 
farthest away.
Three thousand con?rmed 
exoplanets have been 
discovered since 1992. So, 
what makes the TRAPPIST-1 
system noteworthy? All 
seven con?rmed TRAPPIST-1 
planets are terrestrial: they 
resemble Earth in their size 
and rocky composition, 
making their discovery highly 
unusual. TRAPPIST-1 has 
the most rocky planets of any 
known system, and is tied with 
systems Kepler-90, HD 10180, 
and HR 8832 for the most total 
con?rmed exoplanets. Earth-
sized planets are normally 
hard to detect because they 
are relatively small. It can 
be dif?cult to tell whether 
?uctuations in observational 
data indicate the presence 
of actual planets or random 
variations in the star’s activity. 
The astronomers behind the 
TRAPPIST project speci?cally 
targeted small stars, making 
small planets easier to notice.
TRAPPIST-1 is a low-
temperature red dwarf star 
barely larger than Jupiter. 
Small, cool stars are the most 
common type of star, so the 
discovery of the TRAPPIST-1 
system could imply the 
existence of millions more 
systems like it. Dwarf stars are 
also the longest-living stars. 
TRAPPIST-1 consumes energy 
very slowly, so it could live for 
an estimated 12 trillion years. 
For this reason, dwarf stars 
are hypothesized to be the 
most likely place for advanced 
alien civilizations to develop, 
simply because they would 
have enough time to evolve.
Most excitingly, three of 
the seven planets exist in 
their own star’s habitable 
zone, the region of the stellar 
system that could hypotheti-
cally sustain life. The habit-
able zone, sometimes called 
the “Goldilocks zone,” is nei-
ther too hot nor too cold for 
the formation of liquid water. 
The habitable zone in the 
TRAPPIST-1 system is thought 
to contain planets TRAPPIST-
1e, -f, and -g.
The TRAPPIST-1 system 
is theoretically an ideal place 
for life to ?ourish, but there 
are some practical factors 
reducing the likelihood that 
we will ?nd aliens on any of its 
worlds. Because TRAPPIST-1 
is so cool, the habitable zone 
is very close. All seven planets 
orbit closer to the star than 
Mercury does to the Sun, lead-
ing astronomers to believe 
that all potentially habitable 
planets are tidally locked 
to the star. Tidally locked 
planets are manipulated by 
gravity to rotate at the same 
rate they revolve around their 
star, so one hemisphere of the 
planet constantly faces the 
star, and the other constantly 
faces away. Both hemispheres 
would suffer from extreme 
temperatures unsuitable 
for life. Another probable 
consequence of TRAPPIST-1’s 
close proximity to its planets 
is exposure to a high amounts 
of X-ray and ultraviolet (XUV) 
radiation. Intense amounts 
of XUV radiation make it 
extremely dif?cult for a planet 
to retain liquid water, often 
assumed to be necessary for 
the development of life.
At this early stage of 
research, it is impossible 
to know whether the 
TRAPPIST-1 system is capable 
of originating or sustaining 
life. However, several projects 
are already being planned to 
investigate further. Examining 
the planetary atmospheres 
with large, powerful 
instruments like the Hubble 
and James Webb telescopes 
will allow astronomers to 
determine what gases are 
present. Some gases, like 
ozone and methane, are 
strong clues that life is present. 
More powerful telescopes 
than TRAPPIST will detect any 
additional planets that may be 
in the TRAPPIST-1 system and 
provide the data needed to 
construct accurate estimations 
of their mass. With accurate 
mass estimations, scientists 
will know the composition of 
the planets — that is, if they 
are almost all rock, or if they 
contain a signi?cant amount 
of water.
Despite the overwhelming 
uncertainty surrounding 
the star system, some are 
already looking for signs of 
life there. The Search for 
Extra-Terrestrial Intelligence 
(SETI) is keeping its eyes on 
TRAPPIST-1 with its Allen 
Telescope Array, listening for 
alien radio transmissions. No 
signals have been detected 
yet, but SETI director Seth 
Shostak promises that “New 
observations are in the of?ng.”
Stress is the body’s physical reaction to disturbing stimuli
JULIA EVE NAPOLITANO
Staffwriter
At Carnegie Mellon, stress 
is a conversation starter. When 
we have a lot of exams and 
homework, we feel stressed. 
When we say you feel stressed, 
scienti?cally, what do we 
mean?
Stress is a concept 
independent of time and 
age. According to an article 
published in the Indian 
Journal of Endocrynology 
and Metabolism, stress can 
be de?ned as “any situation 
which tends to disturb 
the equilibrium between 
a living organism and its 
environment.”
It is primarily a physical 
response. The body switches 
to its evolutionary ?ght-or-
?ight mechanism in response 
to a physical stimuli by 
releasing hormones. These 
hormones, including primarily 
epinephrine (otherwise 
known as adrenaline), 
norepinephrine, and cortisol, 
get the blood pumping and 
energy rushing.
There are three 
components of the ?ght-or-
?ight mechanism: ?ght (in 
which we feel agitated and 
aggressive towards others 
and any perceived threat), 
?ight (in which we avoid 
the stressor), and freeze (in 
which we lock the energy 
from the perceived threat 
into our nervous system). 
Here at college, our ?ght-or-
?ight response is not so much 
activated by malicious threats 
to our well-being, but by dead-
lines. When we are in “?ght 
mode,” we can negatively 
affect relationships with our 
attitudes and words; in “?ight 
mode,” we avoid deal-
ing with the stress 
and let it escalate 
until it all becomes 
very  unmanageable; 
in “freeze mode”, we 
tend to breathe 
shallowly, 
increasing the 
odds of a panic 
attack.
A little stress reminds 
us of the things we need to 
accomplish. But too much 
stress at once has detrimental 
effects to health. The 
Stress Management 
Society uses a bridge 
analogy when address-
ing stress: “When a 
bridge is carrying too 
much weight, it will 
eventually collapse. 
It is possible to see 
the warning signs 
before this happens, 
the bridge would bow, 
buckle and creak. The same 
principle can be applied to 
human beings, with excessive 
demands and challenges 
placed on our bridges. There 
may be early warning signs. 
However stress can creep up 
on some of us, resulting in an 
unexpected breakdown.”
The heart is one of the ?rst 
organs to be affected by stress. 
Cardiovascular disease is the 
number one killer, increas-
ing every year, and the fact 
that stress has become more 
prevalent leads to a correlation 
between the two. In addition, 
stress causes a rise of blood 
pressure, leading to weaker 
arteries in the brain and a 
higher risk of hemorrhagic 
stroke. Increased stress is 
also a precipitating factor of 
various endocrine disorders, 
including hyperthyroidism, 
Graves’ disease, diabetes 
mellitus, and obesity.
Stress changes a person 
cognitively, emotionally, and 
physically. Under stress, a 
person can have cognitive 
problems, including problems 
with memory, poorer 
judgement, indecision, 
self-doubt, and inability to 
concentrate. 
Emotionally, stress can 
lead to depression, anxiety, 
frustration, and panic. People 
physically have aches and 
pains, and are more likely to 
catch a cold. They may ?nd it 
dif?cult to sleep or sleep too 
much, become more reliant 
on addictions to alcohol and 
drugs to relax, or become 
demotivated.

Space tourism has become a reality thanks to startups
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
It seems tourism is 
exploring its final frontier: 
space. In late 2018, SpaceX 
will place two tourists in 
its Dragon capsule and 
slingshot them around the 
moon. The journey will take 
seven days. Another startup, 
World View Enterprise, 
will lift customers up into 
the stratosphere on hot-air 
balloons. At such a height, 
tourists could gaze down at 
the Earth’s continents and 
curvature, or directly up at 
the stars. We expected space 
tourism to arrive earlier, as 
is depicted in science fiction 
like 2001: A Space Odyssey. 
Nonetheless, it is here, 
and astronauts will soon 
be joined by (exorbitantly 
rich) everyday citizens. The 
technological advances of 
the 21st century make space 
tourism not only a possibility 
but a reality.
Two unidentified people 
placed considerable deposits 
with SpaceX to be the first 
space tourists ever. The price 
probably exceeds the $150 
million two customers paid 
Space Adventures, another 
space tourism company, to 
travel to the International 
Space Station (ISS). The 
moon is much further than 
the ISS, and such a journey 
would require tremendous 
resources and redesigns 
to SpaceX’s capsule. The 
Dragon capsule will fly close 
the moon, following a looped 
path that directs it back to 
Earth after a week.
World View Enterprises 
offers a more modest 
approach to space. Using 
its Stratollite vehicle, 
World View plans to carry 
researchers and tourists alike 
to the edge of the atmosphere. 
There, weather information 
or geological changes can 
be studied. This reduces 
research organizations’ 
needs for expensive satellites 
and rocket launches.
The benefits of space 
tourism are far reaching. As 
more startups emerge to take 
on the dark void, the costs of 
space travel may plummet as 
a result of competition. The 
regular presence of people in 
space may spur more space 
exploration with humans, 
urging us further out into 
the solar system. Many of 
the worlds and moons in 
our solar system have barely 
been explored at the surface 
level, so this is a chance to 
collect far more information 
about them.
However, this is all very 
optimistic. A new, fast-
growing industry is not likely 
to emerge any time soon. The 
cost of being a space tourist 
currently far exceeds the 
budgets of most people on 
the planet. It seems tickets 
currently cost in the millions, 
amounts most of us will not 
see in our lifetimes, let alone 
spend on a trip. It is difficult 
to see space flight prices 
being comparable to, say, 
airline prices in the decades 
to come. Unfortunately, this 
means space tourism does 
not have a good business 
model and cannot morph 
itself into a steady market.
Consider, for example, the 
headache such an industry 
would be for insurance 
companies. Space flight is 
incredibly dangerous, and 
something as little as an 
expanding ring can cause a 
space craft to explode upon 
lift off. SpaceX’s plan to carry 
people around the moon is 
even more daring, expensive, 
and life threatening. For 
example, the Apollo missions 
to the moon were infamously 
dangerous.
Nonetheless, someone has 
to take that first step. Many 
of the technology advances 
in transportation we relish  
today were extremely risky 
endeavors in the past. Space 
is simply another frontier 
that must be reached. It may 
be worth the risk — at least, 
these startups think so.

Women’s basketball triumphs at 2017 ECAC championship
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
Over the weekend, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team won the 
Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) Women’s 
Championship presented by 
Visit Myrtle Beach.
On Friday, the team start-
ed with a win against the 
Brooklyn College Bulldogs.
Though the game be-
gan with a Carnegie Mellon 
three-pointer from ?rst-year 
Katharine Higgins, Brooklyn 
got to a fast start, taking a 7–5 
lead. The Tartans then scored 
13 unanswered points, with 
eight from senior Lisa Murphy, 
who was announced last 
week as a ?nalist for the 2017 
Jostens Trophy. While both 
teams played hard on each 
side of the ball, the Tartans 
made 60 percent of their ?eld 
goals, and the Bulldogs only 
made 30.8 percent. Higgins 
ended the ?rst quarter how 
she started, with a three-point-
er, this time at the buzzer. The 
Tartans maintained their lead, 
ending the ?rst quarter 23–11.
The Bulldogs started the 
second quarter with aggres-
sive play, but the Tartans’ 
great defense forced several 
steals and blocks. The quar-
ter played out similarly as the 
?rst, with Brooklyn burdened 
by many missed shots, par-
ticular three-point attempts. 
With 1:45 left to play in the 
half, ?rst-year Makayla Filiere 
grabbed a steal, quickly mak-
ing a fast-break layup all 
alone on her side of the court. 
Murphy added 12 points in 
the quarter, ?nishing with 20 
in the ?rst half. The second 
quarter ended with Carnegie 
Mellon leading 42–28.
Brooklyn played aggres-
sively after the half, imme-
diately sinking a three-point 
shot, but the Tartans respond-
ed with a trey right back. 
The Tartans’ defense again 
dominated, forcing turnovers, 
which the offense took advan-
tage of, using ef?cient passing 
on the perimeter and into the 
paint to score easy layups. The 
Tartans extended their lead to 
26 points, ?nished the third 
quarter 67–41.
In the fourth quarter, the 
two teams traded shots, but 
the Tartans held onto their 
large lead, allowing for sev-
eral non-starters to enter the 
game. With less than three 
minutes left the play in the 
game, the Bulldogs cut the 
lead to 19 points, but the 
Tartans scored the ?nal three 
baskets to win 84–59, advanc-
ing to the semi?nals of the 
ECAC Championship.
Murphy led the team with a 
double-double, 24 points and 
16 rebounds, while Higgins 
added 20 points 7 rebounds. 
As a team, the Tartans had 
more assists than the Bulldogs 
(18 to 9), more points off of 
turnovers (29 to 12), more 
points in the paint (42 to 16), 
and more fast-break points 
(10 to 0). The Tartans shot 
an overall 49.2 percent from 
the ?eld compared to the 
Bulldogs’ 30.8 percent.
The following day, the 
Tartans faced the Stevenson 
University Mustangs in a 
bout to decide which team 
would play in the ECAC 
Championship ?nal. Both 
teams started the game at full 
speed, playing with power and 
precision, trading baskets, 
quickly tying the game at 6–6. 
After two consecutive three-
point shots from Higgins and 
Filiere, the Tartans jumped to 
a six-point lead. In the ?nal 
3:42 of the ?rst quarter, the 
Tartans went on an 8–0 to end 
the quarter 21–10.
Stevenson struck ?rst in 
the second quarter with a 
three-pointer. Though the 
Mustangs put the pressure on, 
the Tartans sustained their 
signi?cant lead with their fast-
paced offense. The Mustangs 
cut the lead to ?ve near the 
end of the quarter but senior 
Jackie Hudepohl made a two-
point jump shot in ?nal second 
before the buzzer to end the 
?rst half with the Tartans lead-
ing 34–27.
The third quarter saw 
Carnegie Mellon taking bet-
ter advantage of second 
chance shots off of offensive 
rebounds. After back-to-
back three-pointers from the 
Mustangs, the Tartans’ lead 
was cut to four points with 
two minutes remaining the 
quarter. Higgins scored her 
own three-pointer, ending the 
quarter with the score 48–41, 
the Tartans still in the lead.
The fourth quarter contin-
ued as the ?rst three quarters 
had, with consistent play on 
both teams on both sides of 
the ball and Carnegie Mellon 
keeping their small cush-
ion lead. The Tartans’ lead 
stretched to 16 with two min-
utes left to play. The Tartans 
went on to win the game 65–
50.
Murphy recorded her 
20th double-double of the 
season with 20 points and 
19 rebounds, plus 5 blocks. 
Higgins scored 13 points, 
while Hudepohl added 10 
points. The Tartans made 46.7 
percent of their shots from the 
?eld and assisted on 50 per-
cent of their baskets (14). The 
Tartans had 18 points off turn-
overs to Stevenson’s 10, and 
also scored more points in the 
paint (32 to 20).
On Sunday, the Tartans 
battled the Waynesburg 
University Yellow Jackets in 
the ECAC Championship ?nal.
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en got the scoring started with 
a three-pointer from Higgins. 
The Tartans and the Yellow 
Jackets traded shots for the 
?rst ?ve minutes of the ?rst 
quarter, bringing the score to 
an even 9–9. The Yellow Jack-
ets went on an 8–0 run in the 
middle of the quarter to take 
a 17–9 lead. The Tartans then 
had their own 8–0 run, which 
included three-point shots 
from Filiere and ?rst-year 
Megan Jaeb, tying the score 
19–19 at the end the ?rst quar-
ter.
The second quarter contin-
ued the even competition be-
tween the teams, both main-
taining their momentum with 
fast-paced play from the ?rst 
quarter.
Like their previous games 
in the tournament, the Tar-
tans made several offensive 
rebounds to score on second 
chance shots. The game was 
tied three times in the quarter, 
but with two free throws from 
?rst-year Laurel Pereira, the 
Tartans entered the half lead-
ing 40–37.
The second half saw the 
Tartans begin to slowly build 
a small lead over Waynesburg. 
Though the Yellow Jackets 
played aggressively on both 
sides of the ball, the Tartans 
never gave up their lead. The 
quarter ended with the score 
56–52.
In the fourth and ?nal 
quarter, the Tartans extended 
their lead, pulling away from 
the Yellow Jackets. Late in the 
quarter, the Tartans put the 
game away with a three-point 
play (a layup and free throw) 
followed by two free throws 
from Murphy, gaining the 
largest lead of the game, 80–
66. The Yellow Jackets scored 
the ?nal basket of the game, 
but the Tartans went on to win 
80–69.
Murphy ?nished her 
Carnegie Mellon basketball 
career with a double-double, 
23 points and 15 rebounds, 
and was named the tourna-
ment MVP. Filiere recorded 
21 points, a career high, and 
Hudepohl added 14 rebounds 
and 9 points in her ?nal game. 
Statistically, the Tartans and 
the Yellow Jackets had a rela-
tively even game, with the 
Tartans ?eld goal percentage 
at 43.8 percent and the Yellow 
Jackets at 40.3 percent. The 
Tartans recorded more total 
rebounds (46 to 32) and sec-
ond chance points (20 to 12), 
but the Yellow Jackets scored 
more points in the paint (28 
to 18).
With the victory on Sunday, 
completing the season, the 
Carnegie Mellon women’s bas-
ketball team tied the school re-
cord with 21 wins in the 2016-
2017 season. The win marked 
the Tartans’ second ECAC 
Championship in team history.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team com-
peted in the quarter?nals of 
the Eastern College Athletic 
Conference (ECAC) Men’s 
Basketball Championship pre-
sented by Visit Myrtle Beach 
on Friday, March 3 against the 
Stockton University Ospreys.  
The Tartans dropped an 
84–74 decision to Stockton 
in the quarter?nal game. The 
tournament took place at the 
Junker Center on the campus 
of Penn State Behrend.
Senior forward Jack 
Serbin poured in a season-
best 33 points and ?nishes 
his career with 1,549 points 
which ranks second all-time 
in program history. The se-
nior grabbed a game-best 16 
rebounds, as he ?nished the 
season with 315 rebounds to 
tie the Tartans single-season 
record.
Serbin’s double-double 
marked his 17th this season. 
Senior center Chris Shkil 
was the only other Tartan in 
double ?gures with 12 points.
The Tartans shot 38.1 per-
cent from the ?oor for the 
game, as Stockton shot 45.2 
percent including a 51.4 per-
cent effort in the second half. 
Stockton was led by Steve Fe-
rebee with 16 points. Brandon 
Hamilton and Marcus Har-
mon each chipped in with 14 
while Kashaun Barnes ended 
with 13.
Carnegie Mellon started 
the game shooting 7 of 9 
from the ?oor and jumped 
out to a 17–11 lead six min-
utes into play. During the 
stretch, Serbin accounted for 
11 points. Stockton cut the 
Tartans lead to 28–27 with 
seven minutes left in the half, 
but Carnegie Mellon used a 
10–3 run to take its largest 
lead of the half, 38–30, on a 
layup by Shkil with 2:56 on 
the clock. The Ospreys then 
scored the last ?ve points of 
the half which led to a 38–35 
advantage for the Tartans at 
the break.
The Tartans shot 51.6 per-
cent from the ?oor over the 
?rst twenty minutes and held 
Stockton to a 38.9 percent 
performance.
Serbin led all scorers at 
half with 16 points while Shkil 
tabbed 10.
Early in the second half 
with the Tartans leading 
43–38, Stockton scored six 
straight points to take its ?rst 
lead of the contest, 44–43, 
with 14:49 remaining in reg-
ulation. Two minutes later, 
Carnegie Mellon retook the 
lead on a three-pointer by 
?rst-year David Huber and 
pushed the lead to 60–54 with 
9:30 to play. Over the next 
three-and-a-half minutes, 
Stockton used a 16–6 run and 
led 70–66 following back-to-
back three-point baskets with 
six minutes to play. Stockton 
continued to hold the lead the 
rest of the way and went on 
for the 84–74 win.
While this is certainly a 
disappointing ?nish to the 
year, the return of the Tartans 
to postseason play is certainly 
something to celebrate as the 
team looks forward to the 
future.
The Tartans end the sea-
son with a record of 14–12 
overall while the Ospreys 
move to 16–11.

Ski & Snowboard Team in USCSA national competition
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
Skiing and snowboarding 
may not be strongly associat-
ed with Carnegie Mellon, but 
the ski and snowboard team 
has developed into a force to 
be reckoned with. The team 
has persevered over regional 
and conference rivals and re-
cently quali?ed for national 
competition.
The team ?rst started in 
2005 when it was founded 
by current coach Hugh Dunn 
and competes in freestyle, 
slalom, and giant slalom in 
the Allegheny conference 
of the United States Col-
legiate Ski and Snowboard 
Association (USCSA). “We 
compete against Penn State, 
Pitt, Villanova, West Virginia, 
Navy, and a few others,” team 
captain and senior mate-
rial science and engineering 
major Sloane Macklin said. 
“What’s really important is 
that we always beat Pitt.”
This year has been one of 
the most successful for the 
team. In conference competi-
tion, the women’s skiing team 
took third place while the 
men’s earned ?fth. “We had 
three people medal in free-
style this year,” Sloane said, 
referring to her ?rst place in 
freestyle skiing, ?rst-year civil 
and biomedical engineering 
major Tessa Weeden’s second 
place in freestyle snowboard-
ing, and junior biological sci-
ences major Carolyn Vanek’s 
second place in freestyle ski-
ing.
Regionally, the women’s 
skiing team placed sixth, 
earning a spot in the national 
championships. All the team’s 
snowboarders quali?ed for 
nationals. The team members 
were all looking forward to 
the national championships, 
though front-loading the 
week’s assignments certain-
ly weighed on their minds. 
“We’re going to be out all 
week, so we’re trying to get a 
lot of homework done in ad-
vance,” Weeden said. Still, the 
team members seemed more 
excited about the experience 
than drained by coursework.
More important than the 
team’s success is the atmo-
sphere and camaraderie the 
members have with each 
other. When they started, ski-
ing varied from person to per-
son. “Both my parents were 
ski instructors, and I lived in 
Colorado,” sophomore phys-
ics major Sara Graves said. “It 
was sort of a requirement to 
ski, so I started at about two 
and a half.”
“I started snowboarding in 
high school,” Weeden said. “I 
fell in love with it because it’s 
so much fun.” The team even 
takes in people who have no 
prior experience with the 
sport. “Just be a great per-
son and open to trying new 
things. You don’t even have to 
know how to ski.”
On the team atmosphere, 
the members all had similar 
thoughts. “Ski team is a super 
tight-knit group of people,” 
Weeden said. “We hang out 
all the time even outside of 
the team. It’s super chill and 
fun, and everyone supports 
each other all the time.”
Macklin agreed. “It can 
be really tough to organize, 
but that makes things really 
worthwhile when we do.”
She also added her expe-
riences with other college 
students outside of Carnegie 
Mellon.
“We had a meet up with 
Pitt, and it’s really cool to 
meet up with so many people 
from other schools.”
Graves described what the 
team is to her more succinct-
ly: “It’s very much like my oa-
sis on campus.”
The ski and snowboard 
team will compete at the 
USCSA 2017 National 
Championships from Mon-
day, March 6 to Saturday, 
March 11.

On spring break and beach bods
Dear Ruth,
Spring Break is only one week away!
My closest friends and I booked an incredible trip 
to San Juan, Puerto Rico. There are going to be 
clear skies, sunny beaches, and a lot of rum! But, 
there are also going to be a lot of hot people in 
bikinis. Like a lot. But here’s the problem. I’ve lived 
a pretty unhealthy lifestyle for a year or so (see: 
every decision I’ve ever made). I consume entire 
bags of Hot Cheetos on a pretty regular basis. 
And let’s not even get into the downward spirals 
that are my countless trips to Au Bon Pain.
One of my friends is a dancer, and her bod is 
top notch. Another friend has been on crew for 
a bazillion years, so she’s been in shape since, 
like, birth, I think. Another friend eats as many 
Hot Cheetos as me, so that gives me hope — but, 
unfortunately for me, her booty will still look good 
in anything.
I, on the other hand, definitely don’t feel bikini-
body-ready. I don’t want to resort to unhealthy 
crash dieting and there are only so many sit ups 
a girl can do in one week! ONE WEEK! What do 
I do?
Sincerely, 
Feeling Unprepared. Need Your Unmatched 
Nutritional Savvy 
Dear FUNYUNS,
I want this to be an easy question to answer. 
Because the step-by-step process of getting a bikini 
body is actually pretty simple: step one, acquire a 
body (any body, although your own is preferred), 
and step two, put a bikini on it. Bam, bikini body. 
Just like that.
But it’s never that easy, is it? It’s one thing to 
have some stranger tell you that your body is 
beautiful — and it is, trust me. Every body is 
beautiful and anyone who tells you otherwise is 
trying to sell you something entrenched in societal 
beauty standards. But it’s another thing entirely 
to actually put a bikini on your body and go out 
in public when you’re not comfortable doing that. 
We all have insecurities about our bodies, and 
I’m not going to sit here a tell you that a simple 
change of attitude is all you need to fix your 
anxieties. 
That’d be insulting and naive.
So here’s some actual, practical advice. First, 
make sure your bikini actually fits your body. 
Trying to squeeze into too-tight bottoms or pad 
out a too-loose top is just going to make you more 
uncomfortable than you already are. Second, 
bring along some kind of cover-up.You don’t have 
to wear it the entire time — you don’t have to wear 
it at all if you don’t feel like it — but it does give 
you a back up to boost your comfort. You have 
every right to wear a bikini, but you also have 
every right to wear something else. 
Third, remember those friends you mentioned? 
They’re your friends for a reason: they like you. 
And that means they still will like you in whatever 
you want to wear. (And if they don’t like you in 
whatever you wear, well, that’s a different advice 
topic.) You’re all going on vacation together 
because you want to relax and have fun with each 
other. So have fun, and do your best to not worry 
about your body. 
(And if you’re worried about other people’s 
opinions? They can go f*** themselves. You have 
the right to inhabit your body in whatever way 
you want. Your body deserves to exist, and you 
deserve the respect that existence affords.)
Party hard,
Ruth
Ariel Hoffmaier | StaffwriterBar Buddies: STATION
We accidently had the perfect anniversary dinner
Since Zeke had to do homework or something 
(cough nerd cough), I replaced him with a prettier 
bar buddy for this week’s adventure to STATION 
over in Bloomfield. We arrived expecting some 
amusement with train-themed cocktails but 
somehow ended up on a third date — or what felt 
like one. Our beanies and snuggly winter flanels 
felt very out of place. Despite our sticker shock, it 
was snowing, we were starving, and it was the end 
of a very long week. As a wise woman once said, 
“Treat Thyself.”
The location: STATION is a modern American 
“gastropub” in Bloomfield, a pretty under-
appreciated Pittsburgh neighborhood. It’s right on 
the 64 line, if you’re willing to wait forty minutes 
for a bus. That forty-minute-wait caused some 
waves in our suddenly very serious friendship, but 
luckily my “date” took refuge at a trendy poetry 
reading down the street. STATION is nestled 
between two adorable bookshops that are open 
late, which comes in handy if your friend (or, more 
likely, long-term committed partner) also suffers 
from chronic lateness. 
The neighborhood also has a couple of other 
equally trendy looking (and probably pricey) 
bars if a budget busting bar hop is what you’re 
looking for. 
The drinks: STATION’s cocktails are what your 
classy grandma might drink on a yacht. They all 
contain ingredients like “lillet blanc” and “spiced 
carrot juice.” I ordered a Havalina both because 
that’d be a cool name for a high fantasy character 
and because it contains elderflower, which I can 
only assume is what pixies drink out of thimbles. 
The drink was delicious, subtle, and surprisingly 
alcoholic. It was also $12, but that was just a 
poke compared to the stabbing pain of paying 
for entrees. Apparently they have a completely 
different (and cheaper) menu at the bar that those 
b*****s told us nothing about. Let it be noted, 
though, that the food is amazing, though the 
portion sizes are the kind of thing you’d expect to 
see in a comedy sketch about fancy restaurants 
and not in reality. After dropping enough dough to 
cover three normal meals, I still left hungry, so we 
went and bought shitty cookies at CVS. The beer 
and wine is more reasonable, so long as you’re 
not paying for a bottle of “Cosentino ‘The Dark’ 
Petite Syrah,” but STATION rightfully prides itself 
on the craft cocktails.
The vibe: Again, this place is third date, possibly 
even anniversary dinner territory. Everything 
is leather upholstery and red brick walls and 
monochromatic color schemes. Most of the tables 
are for two. The only way the lighting could’ve 
been more romantic is if they’d actually put a 
candle on the table. Sure, you could just go for the 
bar, but the bar was pretty deserted when we left 
around 10. Maybe it livens up later, but I wouldn’t 
take my chances.
Lit or nah: Nah, for the price. STATION has 
beautiful grandma cocktails and delicious food, 
sure, but now I’m going to be living on microwave 
ramen until spring break. Basically, it ain’t worth it 
unless you’ve got money to burn and you want to 
treat someone special. Thanks for the lovely third 
date, Replacement Zeke.

Two Sundays ago, 33 million people tuned in 
to watch what turned out to be the most bizarre 
Academy Awards show to date. Despite candy 
falling from the sky, stellar performances both 
in the nominated films and on-stage, and Jimmy 
Kimmel delivering relatively well as host, the 
very last moment of the night is all people will 
remember — forever. A PricewaterhouseCoopers 
accountant handed presenters Faye Dunaway 
and Warren Beatty the wrong envelope, resulting 
in the wrong winner being read for the grand-
est award of all — Best Picture. The moment was 
awkward, shocking, and fleeting. Yet, if one disre-
gards it, the night was almost a success.
Stars started arriving at the Dolby Theatre red 
carpet around 5:30 p.m. As they stepped out 
in front of cameras, fans, and interviewers, 
one trend immediately stood out: the American 
Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) ribbon. Ever since 
President Trump took office, the organization has 
seen its greatest volume of donations, certainly 
the public’s response to the new administration’s 
policies. The celebrities of Hollywood accepted 
the trend, boldly ignoring those who adamantly 
proclaim they should stick to acting and keep out 
of real issues and politics.
The one celebrity who has weathered the most 
backlash is, undoubtedly, Meryl Streep. An 
accomplished and revered actress with 20 Oscar 
nominations, Streep was labeled as overrated 
by the commander-in-chief after she publicly 
reprimanded him for his mockery of a disabled 
reporter. Host Kimmel could not help but comical-
ly weave this into his opening monologue. Streep 
received a standing ovation from the Oscar crowd 
for her “lackluster” career and stance against bul-
lies.
Kimmel did not stop the Trump jabs there. His gig 
was filled with political content, as was expected. 
He joked, “I want to say thank you to President 
Trump. Remember last year when it seemed like 
the Oscars were racist?”
Kimmel drew laughter from the crowd time and 
time again, displaying his effortless comedy. And 
so the night, and the handing out of awards, 
began smoothly.
Almost every category held one title — La La 
Land. Following the Mad Max sweep last year, 
the musical was nominated in 14 categories — 
tying the all time record — for best production 
design, costume design, sound mixing, sound 
editing, film editing, original screenplay, cinema-
tography, score, actress, actor, and picture. It 
effortlessly won six 
of those awards. La 
La Land’s success is 
very much warranted. 
The film captured the nos-
talgia of the Golden Age of 
cinema while wrapping it in 
our modern times. It displayed 
the raw power of dreaming along 
with the honesty and sincerity of 
love. Its score, vibrant colors, chore-
ography, and intimate performances 
deserved each nomination.
The night continued comfortably, with 
amazing musical performances by Justin 
Timberlake, Moana’s Auli’i Cravalho, and La 
La Land’s John Legend. Cravalho performed 
the animation’s chart-topping song “How Far I’ll 
Go” in a flowing red gown and with flag bearers 
twirling behind her. One of those flags suddenly 
bumped Cravalho in the head, yet she went on 
undeterred as though nothing happened. Her 
resilience was refreshing. But in retrospect, per-
haps the bump was foreshadowing.
More awards were presented while the crowd 
grew hungry, as it is wont to during a three-hour 
ceremony. Last year’s answer to that hunger was 
girl scout cookies, and the year before turned to 
boxes of pizza. Both solutions failed the equal 
distribution test. This year, Kimmel dropped hun-
dreds of candy bars, cookies, and donuts in mini 
parachutes from the high-rise ceiling of the Dolby 
Theatre. Not everyone was lucky enough to have 
the refreshments land in their lap (i.e. Taraji P. 
Henson), but the display was both entertaining 
and considerate to the audience members.
The saddest bit of the night arrived — The Oscars 
“In Memoriam” tribute. Faces of old and young 
artists who passed away in the last year flashed 
across the screen. Debbie Reynolds and her 
daughter, Carrie Fisher, who both passed in late 
2016, shared the screen together, an emotional 
moment. Then came an even greater foreshad-
owing. Australian producer Jan Chapman, who 
is very much alive, had her photo shown in the 
“In Memoriam” tribute. “I was devastated by 
the use of my image in place of my great friend 
and long-time colleague Janet Patterson,” said 
Chapman in a statement to Variety. The gaffe may 
not have been noticed immediately by the crowd 
and viewers at home, however.
Kimmel continued the night, mocking his (fake) 
nemesis Matt Damon in front of everyone. Viola 
Davis gave an inspiring speech, per usual, 
and Back to the Future’s pop cultural impact 
was honored.
Then came the fateful moment of announcing best 
picture. The announcement of the mix-up shock 
and images of the crowd prove almost every jaw 
hit the floor. Knowing Kimmel’s jovial nature, the 
crowd initially thought of it as a joke in poor taste. 
They soon learned it was as real as mistakes could 
get. Perhaps the moment’s greatest dishonor was 
turning the spotlight away from Moonlight’s suc-
cess. People might not remember that a power-
ful film about the struggles of a gay black man 
in America won best picture over the conven-
tional Hollywood movie. They’ll only remember 
the envelope.

South Asian Students unite for a night to remember
Every year, Mayur — Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian Student Association — along with numer-
ous other South Asian groups on campus, puts on the Mayur Show, a celebration of Indian 
culture. The show embraces the tropes and stereotypes that tickle those who grew up in Indian 
households. This year’s show, titled Fifty Shades of Brown, followed the story of Deep Pant, an 
American-born Indian in denial of his roots, who eventually finds his way through love and a 
little hardship. The show was packed with dancing, singing, and wonderfully corny acting. The 
Mayur Show seems to get better every year and has continued to draw in larger and larger 
audiences.
Some of the guest performers of the night were CMU Sahara, CMU Jiya, CMU Bhangra, CMU 
Saans, and CMU Deewane, who took the stage in accordance with their relation to the story 
line. Additionally, the many members of Carnegie Mellon’s South Asian community performed 
in first female, then male sections of a dance piece called “Chaos.” The show also featured a 
fashion show, where a mix of Indian and Western clothes were modeled by students strutting 
down the runway in twos and threes.
The show finished off with a performance from the graduating seniors involved in Mayur dur-
ing their time at Carnegie Mellon. The performances brought heaviness and tears of joy to the 
stage.
Laughter and “awes” filled Rangos as the show progressed, and left everyone in the audience 
with warmth in their spirits.

Guaranteed Fresh
New show at The Frame gives voice to the voiceless 
Gowri Sunder | Staffwriter
photos by Zichen Liu | Photo Editor
Around this time last year, The Tartan published an article on a show that 
included the work from then sophomore, now junior art majors Jenna Houston 
and Kate Werth. In just a year’s time, stepping into the Frame Gallery for their 
most recent group exhibit, Guaranteed Fresh, the growth and maturity of their 
work is clear. The show has a colder, more sterile feel. Collections of objects 
— a peace sign, flowers, birth control pills — spray-painted white, self portrait 
photography, and large installations of lettering wash over intimate narratives 
with a clinical feel. Juxtaposition plays a key role in the curation of their work, 
blending a matter-of-fact, commercial aesthetic with intimate and often somber 
topics relating to sexuality and girlhood. Guaranteed Fresh, Houston explains, 
combines these ideas with the notion of standards. The different standards of 
relationships and sexualities that exist in our cultures, communities, and societ-
ies, but also the ways that queerness, disability, and the spaces that girls occu-
py contradict these norms.
Werth is specifically interested in exploring how women exist in digital spaces, 
which becomes most evident in her performance video piece on Omegle, an 
anonymous chat site that has become rife with controversy for the lack of filters 
of on-camera profanity, nudity, and sexual content. Her piece’s strength is its 
simplicity: to ask strangers, who are often there to solicit the female users of 
the site, how they know if a relationship is over. This causes a strange shift of 
the conversation into unexpectedly heartfelt stories of loss and heartbreak. It 
also shifts the power of relationships in a space where objectification of women 
is expected and normal. If there is one defining piece for Werth’s conceptual 
focus, I think it might be this one.
Her newer pieces involve delicate fabrics and materials to tell the stories 
of girls’ relationships with their bodies and boys. Naturally drawn to text, 
Werth says all her work deals with text in one way or another. Pieces such 
as “Swimming Pools” recall digital language — think Tumblr text graphics and 
Pinterest-style advertisements — but, through light, media, and context, allude to 
more complex narratives.
Werth has a knack for words, saying a lot with short, intimate, first-person nar-
ratives of girls navigating relationships. The delicate, silver lettering hung like 
buntings on the gallery walls, play with shadow and arrangement in a way that 
makes it challenging to read, requiring the reader to spend more time with the 
text to figure out what is being said. Asking the audience to spend more time 
with language is a crucial part of her work.
The contrast of delicate, ethereal fabrics and text with the almost tangible pres-
ence the text claims has an effect of giving voices to words that are silenced 
because of inexplicable social expectations. It parallels Werth’s statement that 
women are expected to be delicate, but the “female form [is] strong and the 
vagina [is] a rugged place, not reactionary ... it doesn’t need be activated by 
anything.”
Houston’s work also relies heavily on powerful, intimate narratives of girls and 
their relationships and bodies. In contrast to those of her collaborator, her piec-
es are more sculptural and solid — the mattress in one corner of the gallery and 
the images of female bodies are more tangible than figurative. In this show, her 
work is focused on two major themes: disability and queerness. Specifically, 
her work weaves in personal narratives of vulvodynia, a chronic pain syn-
drome that occurs in the vulvar area whose causes remain unknown and poorly 
researched. Through zines, poetry, and digital media, Houston explores the 
relationship of gender and the body through this lens of chronic pain. The 
importance of such work is most clearly impactful in that it opens up a conver-
sation on a topic of great stigma. Endometriosis, vulvodynia, and other topics 
of biosex female health, especially on issues relating to sexual organs, are still 
very under-researched in the scientific community. Moving from a lack of sci-
entific attention to individuals’ live experiences is extremely important in such 
conversations, and what Houston is particularly good at is talking about spe-
cific, nuanced aspects of such experiences. For instance, her work talks about 
navigating power in sexual relationships with the added burden of explaining a 
disability to boys who have not learned to prioritize their partner’s experience.

---------------------------------------------------

7
Her work in queerness naturally follows this question of self in relationships. 
Houston begins to get at the broader idea of queerness, moving beyond only 
sexual orientation to the ways it changes relationships in terms of balance of 
power and gender expectations. Her work subtly calls upon ideas of family, 
religion, and society while never losing focus on the first-person narrator. The 
small poems placed around her sculptural installations ground her work in self-
portraiture and tie in seamlessly with Werth’s focus on text. Houston’s text here 
is matter of fact, but extremely personal. What the culmination of such work 
allows the viewer to do is have a rare insight into the world of girls growing up 
in a white, middle class, suburban environment. Houston says her use of text is 
recent, stemming from her work with zines that are intended to be both protests 
and informative.
Houston and Werth’s collaboration feels natural. Their work appears to 
respond and divert in ways that add complexity to their narrative of girlhood. 
They say this collaboration is natural; although their work exists in separate 
niches, their overlaps in both classes and personality have created work that is 
uniquely related and often plays off of one another’s. The most notable similar-
ity is in their strong use of personal narrative. Their own experiences with their 
bodies, relationships, and culture are the main influence of their work. From the 
personal, they achieve the universal. The minimalistic approach to the aesthetics 
— the limited color palette, the intentionality of material and form — emphasizes 
the question of text versus silence. These narratives often play with what has 
been left unsaid by girls in situations where their agency has been compro-
mised. The audience, especially female audience, recalls their own experience 
as they empathize with the stories presented. Guaranteed Fresh’s expert focus 
on claiming space to give voice and agency to women and girls is a testament 
to the honesty and power of their work.
In the future, both Houston and Werth talk about expanding their work out-
ward in subject matter. I am excited to see how their work continues expand 
into more diverse experiences — spanning race, gender identity, and social 
class — while remaining grounded in intimate, personal perspectives. In a social 
and political climate where empathy and importance placed on marginalized 
voices feel lacking, their work and particular brand of activism is needed more 
than ever.

Shreeyagya Khemka | Staffwriter

anything about stage designers, or that it was even 
someone’s job. However, this episode blew me 
away. Devlin has designed gorgeous, revolutionary 
stages for not only the theatre but also for concerts 
for Beyonce, Kanye West, Adele, and many others, 
each of which are attended by tens of thousands 
of people. Unfortunately, or rather, fortunately, my 
best writing cannot do justice to describing the stag-
es she has created. You just have to see it to believe 
it. Through this episode, Devlin leads us through 
some her revolutionary works — the inspiration 
behind those works, the process of creation of those 
works, and the significance of those works. This is 
helpful for an ignorant viewer like me. She breaks 
her design process down into concrete ingredients 
like darkness, time, etc. and then shows how she 
mixes these ingredients to create the final result. This 
helps us understand that there is no genius involved, 
only hard work. It makes Devlin look human, and in 
doing so inspires us to work hard in the hope that 
we may be able to create great things as well. Want 
to hear another inspiring story? Devlin went to col-
lege like the rest of us, and the way she was discov-
ered was through a design competition senior year. 
Now, doesn’t that sound doable? If you can only 
watch one episode, it should be this one.
Ah, the episode on Bjarke Ingels, the maverick 
architect. A little backstory: I was initially inspired 
to watch this series because I wanted to watch this 
episode. Way back in high school, I had read the 
New Yorker profile on Ingels, titled “High Rise — A 
bold Danish architect charms his way to the top,” 
and since then I have been following this man’s rise 
to the top. This episode was very much Ingels and 
contained throwbacks to the many things I remem-
ber reading back then including his economical, 
environment friendly, and crazy designs. This man 
is larger than life and this episode glorified that. It 
started with the director asking Ingels what he would 
like this documentary to be, to which he responds, 
“I want it to be like the documentary version of 
Inception.” And it ends with the director asking 
Ingels whether he ever dreams of buildings, to which 
he responds, “I never dream about my work, actu-
ally, interestingly enough.” The last shot is that of 
Ingels jumping on a trampoline in front of a camera 
crew to simulate the shot of him flying through the 
air. I don’t know if you need more context than that 
to understand what this episode was about, but to 
summarize it was the camera following Ingels doing 
cool s***, breaking existing traditions, and occa-
sionally pissing people off.
The next episode was on Ralph Gilles. The descrip-
tion on Netflix for this episode reads, “As Fiat 
Chrysler’s global head of design, Ralph Gilles steers 
the brand into the future with sleek new sports cars 
and a self-driving electric van.” This episode was 
bad. Okay, it wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t nearly on 
par with the other ones. Gilles is a car designer 
who reached cult status because he designed the 
Chrysler 300C. However, this cult status was not well 
translated into the episode. The episode blandly fol-
lowed him around coming in and out of corporate 
meetings, listened to his management philosophies, 
watched him drive a race car, and for some brief 
genuine moments showed his struggles against his 
father. There was no talk about the process of cre-
ation or the process of design. We were essentially 
following a corporate honcho. Being a car fanatic, 
this was a huge letdown. I was looking forward to 
an amazing episode where I could see the amount 
of work that went into designing cars. Instead, 
through most of the episode, the only thought going 
through my head was how much Chrysler must have 
paid Netflix to make this. Not everything can be 
great, so let’s move on.
The sixth episode was on Paula Scher and harked 
back to the awesomeness of the first few episodes. 
Scher is a graphic artist, and like Rand, is responsi-
ble for designing ubiquitous logos such as Windows 
8 and Citi Bank. She has also designed some amaz-
ing album covers, which is what initially brought 
her work to attention. Her work has the power to 
create brands. For example, her work on the Public 
Theatre was responsible for creating the image that 
it has today. I could go on and on, but I’d rather 
tell you what made this episode good. This episode 
was good because it really retained and made good 
use of the themes I mentioned at the start. It showed 
revolutionary work by the designer, it followed the 
designer on a project she was working on currently, 
and it gave us a peek into her private life. Also, this 
episode came back to showing the importance of 
the process of creation. Take those good ingredients, 
mix them up, adapt them to the designer, and voila, 
you have a good, if not great, episode.
Overall, though, the series was eye-opening and 
amazing. I am generally not one for documentaries, 
least of all biographical ones, but these were differ-
ent. They stood out. They introduced me to heroes in 
different fields and inspired me to use their creative 
processes in my own creations. More importantly, 
though, the series talks about people who, for the 
most part, haven’t reached the ends of their careers 
and still have miles to go. It talks about people 
who weren’t necessarily prodigies or born knowing 
design was thier destiny, people who went to school 
for design — essentially ordinary people who went 
to school, worked hard, got good — scratch that — 
great, at what they do, and are now revolutionizing 
their fields. I don’t know about you, but as a young 
student, that is exactly what I want to hear.

Abstract: The Art of Design
Netflix documentary inspires through design
I wanted to start this article with an amazing quote 
on design. Something that makes me sound erudite 
while also being able to fit into the message I want-
ed to convey with this article. This was a hard task. 
It led to great delays in submitting this article for 
copy and a very impatient editor on the other end. 
However, after many hours of scouring the web, I 
found the perfect quote. It was said by Paul Rand, 
the guy who designed the logos for IBM, ABC, 
Enron, and UPS. He says, “Design is so simple, 
that’s why it is so complicated.” This quote is easy 
to understand; it is simple. But it is also complicated 
because of the time and effort it took me to find this 
simple yet perfect quote.
Similarly, great design is also simple, but the process 
of finding it is complicated. Often we forget the time 
and effort spent by the people who create these 
great designs. Netflix’s new documentary series, 
Abstract: The Art of Design, celebrates the time and 
effort great designers spend in creating magnifi-
cent designs through an exploration of their works 
and lives.
The documentary series is eight episodes long. Each 
episode covers a designer from a different field. 
Since each field is different, the episodes are quite 
varied, but all of them share some common themes. 
They all cover a famous work of the designer, one 
that made that designer stand out of the crowd; they 
follow a project that the designer is working on cur-
rently, and they give us a peek (thankfully not the 
reality television version) into the private lives of the 
designers. This allows all of the stories to thematical-
ly work together as a cohesive whole while allowing 
each episode to be non-repetitive in structure.
Now, without further ado, let me introduce the 
designers; there is Christoph Niemann in Illustration, 
Tinker Hatfield in Footwear Design, Es Devlin in 
Stage Design, Bjarke Ingels in Architecture, Ralph 
Gilles in Automotive Design, Paula Scher in Graphic 
Design, Platon in Photography, and Ilse Crawford 
in Interior Design. Maybe you are hyperventilat-
ing right now because you recognize someone you 
admire from this list. If not, though, I can guarantee 
you this: you have seen one of their works at some 
point in your life. Their creations are ubiquitous and 
in some cases revolutionary to such a degree that it 
changed the entire game in that field. So, let’s talk 
through some of the episodes. First up, “Illustration.”
Christoph Niemann is a German illustrator respon-
sible for designing many of the amazing New Yorker 
covers. The episode on Niemann starts by giving 
us a feel for the artist. It achieves this by showing 
Niemann framed unusually by the camera and then 
by showing discussions between the director of 
the episode and Niemann about what the episode 
should be about. I enjoyed this break from the tra-
ditional documentary setting and the fact that they 
showed how the episode was created. It not only 
broke the barrier between the audience and the 
subject of the episode but also allowed us to interact 
directly with Niemann. It was a way to show the 
essence of the process behind creating something, 
which is what most of the episode is about. It is 
about Niemann teaching us the process of creation. 
It is about him instructing us that design is not some 
flash of inspiration but rather continuous hard work. 
Through the episode, he walks us through his pro-
cess of creation: how he is constantly creating and 
doing things that heighten his skills. This process is 
made more palpable later in the episode when it dis-
plays Niemann going through the process of design-
ing his May 16, 2016 New Yorker cover titled “On 
the Go.” This cover is historic because it is not only 
printed on both the front and back of the magazine 
but also when you look at the cover through a digi-
tal medium, you can see the cover come alive and 
reveal a three-dimensional city. This episode was def-
initely the best out of all the others. To some extent, 
it spoiled me for the episodes to come.
The next episode was on Tinker Hatfield, the iconic 
designer behind the Air Jordans. Hatfield’s episode 
was different from the other episodes in that Hatfield 
is retired. All the other designers shown are still 
actively working, with many of them having miles of 
road ahead. Nevertheless, I liked this episode for 
two reasons: first, the process behind his creation 
and second, the emphasis on the importance of col-
lege. The episode, like the one on Niemann, spent 
a lot of time decoding the designer’s process. With 
Niemann it was a discussion, but with Hatfield it 
was more of a monologue. In this episode, Hatfield 
orates the inspirations and discussions that went 
behind designing each of the Air Jordans. He talks 
about the errors he made, the number of sleepless 
nights he spent and the time that he spent away 
from family to do his work. Next, he talks about how 
college was the reason that he got into this business 
in the first place. Hatfield used to be an athlete at 
the University of Oregon. However, an injury led 
him to pursue a major in architecture, but while he 
was an athlete, he developed a close friendship with 
the track coach at the university, and it was through 
this relation that he came into the field of designing 
shoes. Overall, this episode was a bit of a letdown, 
but I appreciated the importance that Hatfield 
placed on college and hard work.
The third episode followed Es Devlin, a British stage 
designer. Until watching this episode, I didn’t know

Apeksha Atal | Pillbox EditorPanic! At The Disco
Middle school emo heartthrobs come to Pittsburgh
Panic! At The Disco is that band that your friends 
listened to in middle school and now makes you 
wonder how they’re still around. Those who love 
them love them a lot, and those who don’t either 
discount them because of their “emo-trilogy” 
roots, or, in rare cases, are just genuinely not into 
it. To these people, I say, come on. You have to 
look a little beneath the surface to understand 
why Panic! is surviving, even as the one-man show 
that it has become.
Their latest concert was at The Petersen Event 
Center, which is not as far from campus as one 
might think. In fact, technically, it’s an estimated 
five minute walk after a short bus ride into 
Oakland. What Google Maps will fail to tell you, 
however, is that there is a monster of a hill to hike 
up. So yes, the walk over was not as convenient 
as I had hoped, despite the short distance, but it 
was all worth it.
From their debut album, A Fever You Can’t Sweat 
Out, to their most recent classic rock, pop, and 
jazz-inspired album, Death of a Bachelor, every 
album that this band puts out is unique in genre, 
length, style, and mood. This leaves fans in sus-
pense every time they promise a new album. 
Panic! is also one of the few bands that gives 
me a lot of trouble in selecting favorite albums 
and songs. Everything is different, but everything 
is tied together with the golden thread that is 
Brendon Urie’s voice — with the exception of some 
of their older work.
Urie, the lead singer and longest standing mem-
ber, has become the center of the band. Other 
members have come and gone, but he has man-
aged to endure through the constant evolution 
and growth of the music that Panic! is associated 
with. He has shown off the softness of his vocals 
in songs like “Folkin’ Around” from Panic!’s folk-
inspired album Pretty Odd and the strength in 
more upbeat songs like the recent hit “Victorious.” 
I had seen Panic! in concert once before at the 
Thrival music festival in 2015. All I remember is 
being overwhelmed with the quality of the perfor-
mance, and how the live performance elevated 
every time I listened to their music thereafter. I 
expected no less this time around.
Urie and the traveling members of Panic! took the 
stage after openers Saint Motel and Misterwives, 
who kept the crowd excited and on their feet dur-
ing their performances. Once Panic! was up, the 
shrieking of voices young and old overwhelmed 
the arena. They opened with “Don’t Threaten Me 
With A Good Time” from their newest, Grammy 
nominated album. The song starts with a “Rock 
Lobster”-inspired guitar riff that never fails to send 
fans into a frenzy, and gives Urie the chance to 
start the show belting. The tone then shifted to the 
darker side with “LA Devotee” and spun further 
into “Golden Days.”
Always a sensational performer, Urie skipped 
around in a golden blazer and worked the audi-
ence with finesse. At one point he froze with the 
music on stage in a victorious pose with his arms 
extended upwards and back towards the audi-
ence, and then proceeded to do a backflip as the 
music swung back in. A little later in the night, 
Urie disappeared, and a clip featuring Fall Out 
Boy’s Pete Wentz was shown on the big screen 
behind the stage. Urie then reappeared from the 
back of the audience, and took to a giant revolv-
ing silver piano in the middle of the crowd, where 
he sang an acoustic and soulful rendition of “This 
Is Gospel” from Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To 
Die, with the entire audience singing along. 
Phone flashlights were up, and the venue had 
handed out colored hearts to some audience 
members, resulting in what looked like a blanket 
of multicolored stars swaying all the way around 
the arena. With his post-marriage swan song 
“Death of a Bachelor” Urie even walked right 
through the crowd, hugging fans as he made his 
way back up to the stage. 
All the songs I’ve mentioned so far are some 
of Panic!’s newer pieces, which could have left 
some of their original fans a little upset. To cater 
to these fans, Panic! compiled a medley of “The 
Only Difference Between Martyrdom and Suicide 
Is Press Coverage,” “Camisado,” and “But It’s 
Better If You Do” that left fans screaming. The 
medley was an ode to the congruity and flow of 
their older songs, with three pieces that seamlessly 
flowed into one another, and made hearts flutter. 
Even with these performance feats, the highlight 
of the show didn’t come until near the end.
“Girls/Girls/Boys” is the LGBTQ anthem on 
Too Weird To Live, Too Rare To Die, and while 
performing it, Urie shouted out to the ridiculous-
ness of the hate that LGBTQ people have been 
subjected to over the past few months. The per-
formance featured images of LGBTQ icons rang-
ing from Ellen Degeneres and Anderson Cooper 
(swoon) to Ru Paul and Elton John. The images 
then assembled themselves into the LGBTQ flag, 
and needless to say the crowd erupted. With 
that, Urie announced that he was about to per-
form a song by one of his “favorite gay people 
of all time,” and proceeded to perform Panic!’s 
cover of Queen’s iconic “Bohemian Rhapsody.” 
This, friends, is where I officially lost it — mostly 
because Queen is my all time favorite band, and 
the buildup to the cover made the performance 
cathartic, to say the least.
You should give your middle school loves a 
chance. Artists have the ability to evolve as the 
world and you do. If you’re lucky, their new stuff 
will gel with you, and you won’t have to throw 
away those old t-shirts you have stashed in the 
back of your closet. Pull ‘em back out and support 
those musicians that supported you through your 
awkward puberty-struck younger self.

Caleb Milller | Junior StaffwriterGet Out
When race issues are the real scare factorart by Paola Mathus | Staff Artist
The scariest part of Jordan Peele’s brilliant new 
horror movie Get Out is how accurately it portrays 
veiled liberal racism. While there is plenty of 
blood, eerie music, and jolts to make you jump, 
Peele never strays from his goal to shed light on 
how common unintentionally racist comments and 
appropriation of African-American culture remain 
in America. Peele, who wrote and directed the 
film, first rose to fame as one half of the sketch 
comedy duo Key & Peele, which employed 
satire, slapstick, and other types of humor to 
talk about American society. In Get Out he 
skillfully integrates comedy and horror in perfect 
proportion, keeping the audience on the edge 
of their seats while making a crucial point about 
racism in America.
The film follows Chris (Daniel Kaluuya), a young 
black photographer, on his trip upstate with his 
white girlfriend Rose (Allison Williams) to meet her 
parents for the first time. Despite his worries that 
her parents don’t know he’s black, she assures him 
that her parents aren’t racist. When they arrive, 
everything seems relatively normal — there are 
some awkward moments with her father, Dean 
(Bradley Whitford), when he uses traditionally 
black vernacular or tries excusing the presence 
of their black servants. After some suspicious 
behavior by the hired help, Chris grows concerned 
about the family’s true intentions. As the film 
escalates, several alarming discoveries unearth 
their malicious scheme.
What makes Get Out so powerful is that it doesn’t 
focus on the type of racism that is typically 
acknowledged and criticized — instead, the movie 
sheds light on the behavior of white liberals, 
who may mean well but are unintentionally 
making black people uncomfortable. This is quite 
prominent in the beginning of the film, before 
many of the horror elements are introduced. Peele 
wrote and shot the film in a way that highlights 
how seemingly innocent, if misguided, word 
choices are actually perceived by Chris. After 
Dean refers to Chris and Rose’s relationship as a 
“thang,” Peele shows Chris wincing slightly. Later, 
Dean follows his meager excuse for the black 
servants by stating he would have “voted for 
Obama for a third term,” to which Chris responds 
with a unenthusiastic “yeah.” While these 
reactions may have gone unnoticed by the liberal, 
supposedly well-meaning hosts, Peele explicitly 
shows how this appropriation and the insensitivity 
created a painful moment for Chris.
Get Out is not just a masterpiece for its relevant 
and critical social commentary — the film is 
expertly paced, slowly building suspense with 
nearly all of the action occurring in the last 25 
minutes. Peele drops hints that everything is not 
quite as it seems, with unnerving behavior by the 
servants and parents giving way to creepy but 
not outright villainous conduct. For example, the 
calculated, robotic way that the servants speak is 
a bit alarming, causing the viewer to become even 
more suspicious after the maid repeatedly unplugs 
Chris’ phone as it’s charging. This slow build 
leads to nail-biting tension, where the audience 
constantly expects something to go wrong and 
becomes more and more stressed about Chris’ 
safety. The numerous unsettling 
signs create an atmosphere 
that causes incredibly 
effective jump scares. 
While some horror movies 
tend to overuse these 
tactics to the point of 
cliché, there are only two 
in the first hour and twenty 
minutes. The sparse use 
of scares early makes 
the ending much 
more terrifying, so 
that by the time 
the climax begins, 
the audience is 
so wound-up that 
the fast-paced 
and dramatic events 
leave them clutching 
their armrests and sweating. 
However, while the finale 
does include several horror movie moments, 
Peele avoids explicitly showing most of the brutal 
violence onscreen and instead concentrates on 
major plot twists that keep the viewer wide-eyed 
till the end.
The movie isn’t all edge-of-the-seat thrills — the 
tension is periodically broken up by humor. The 
majority of the humor comes in scenes with Chris’ 
boisterous friend Rod (Lil Rel Howery), who 
works for the TSA but likes to think of himself 
as a detective mastermind. He also tends to go 
overboard with his explanations, as is seen when 
Chris tells him he was hypnotized. Here, Rod 
worries that Chris will be turned into a sex slave 
for white people, which results in an odd yet 
funny and profane rant about Jeffrey Dahmer and 
his victims. The humor is well-spaced, giving the 
audience a chance to breathe every once in while, 
but not consuming the movie and taking away 
from the main story. Furthermore, as Howery 
noted himself in an interview with Vulture, Rod acts 
as the audience’s voice. From nearly the beginning 
of the film, Rod is telling Chris not to go. Even if 
his advice is a little misguided at first, he echoes 
many of the audiences concerns to Chris. The fact 
that the humor is concentrated in scenes with Rod 
also means there are no campy, one-liner attempts 
at humor during any of the suspenseful or action-
packed sequences.
By shooting the movie from Chris’ perspective 
and building up the suspense so effectively, 
Peele creates a strong emotional attachment 
to Chris — so much so that the entire audience 
reacts together to many of the events. Aside from 
laughing at the jokes and jumping at some of the 
scary moments, there was applause at crucial 
moments throughout as well as when the credits 
rolled. During triumphant moments, moviegoers 
cheered and leapt from their seats; during stressful 
moments, many people made audible attempts to 
warn Chris of impending danger and talk back to 
other characters. The audience was so invested 
and stressed that they simply couldn’t hold back.

Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival
Some of you might be wondering what the heck the giant mask that’s been appearing around campus (and is currently 
staring at you) is. As people who attended the Carnegie Mellon International Film Festival’s (CMU IFF) preview event on 
Friday, March 3 found out, the mask, created by Baron Batch, is part of the festival’s first ever collaboration with a local 
artist. Every year, the CMU IFF brings contemporary films from across the globe to Pittsburgh to spotlight underrepresented 
voices in the film industry and promote cultural exchange, and this year’s festival brings the visual arts into the mix. 
That’s not the only thing that’s new about this year’s CMU IFF, Faces of Identity. This year’s focus on identity was chosen 
with an eye on the current unpresidented political climate and because, as CMU IFF states, “in order to live the identities 
we nurture, there must be dialogue — dialogue to confront obstacles to changing the world’s foundations to foster the 
individual.” The CMU IFF offers a platform for that dialogue. View the films and join in on the dialogue at the festival, 
which runs from March 23 to April 9. Snag your tickets at www.cmu.edu/faces. They’re only $5 with a student ID!
