Ralph B. Coldren, ’10, of Wireton, Pa., 
was elected captain of the base-ball team last 
Wednesday evening at a meeting of the play­
ers, made necessary by the resignation of Cap­
tain Halferty, who has been forced to retire 
on acount of pressure of school work. Col­
dren hails from Franklin and Marshall Col­
lege, where he was a strong factor on both the 
base-ball and foot-ball teams. He holds down 
third base,on the 'l ech team and has played 
consistent ball all season. We feel certain 
that with his ability as a leader, the Tech ag­
gregation is in competent hands.
The Director delivered an intensely inter­
esting talk to the Senior Class last Friday, 
taking for his topic, “Destiny.” He cited sev­
eral factors which he believes had especial 
bearing upon the futures of young men and 
cautioned them against forming habits which 
tend to become obstacles in their paths toward 
success.

The Carnegie Tech athletic grounds, which 
have been in course of construction for some 
time, were formally opened Tuesday with a 
ball game between Westminster College and 
Tech, which resulted in a 3 to 1 victory for 
Tech.
Nelson Hamerschlag, the youthful son of 
Director Hamerschlag, opened the season by 
throwing the first ball over the plate.
Capt. Coldren played the game of his life. 
He showed up well in the field, ]?articularly 
having three putowcs and seven assists. Bragg 
pitched a masterly game, having fine control 
and allowing only two hits. He did not issue 
a pass and fanned five hitters.
Tech scored in the second inning. McKin­
ley, the first man up, led off with a hit. Kirk 
sacrified. Slocum put one along the first base 
line advancing “Mac" to third, from which 
station he scored on Lytle’s hit. In the third 
Barclay led off with a hit, Burgham was hit
with a pitched ball. Coldren flied out to center. 
Both runners crossed the gum 011 Halfertv’s 
hit.In Westminster's half of the fourth Hous­
ton led off with a single, stole second, scored 
on Taylor’s hit. Tech had men 011 In-f­
eral times, but the necessary hit was not forth­
coming. Score:

CIVIL ENGINEERING SOCIETY.
Saturday evening, May 9, the Civil Engineer­
ing Society entertained the members of the 
Plebe class who have selected Civil Engineer­
ing as their course of study, at the school 
buildings.
The object of the entertainment was to 
give the guests a better understanding of what 
civil engineering embraces.
President Provost in behalf of the society 
welcomed the new men. Mr. Flayer gave a 
brief historical sketch of the society and its 
future prospects. Messrs. Reed and Posset 
created much applause by short character 
sketches intermingled with incidents connect­
ed with their practical experience. Mr. Seisel 
of the Seniors and Messrs. Martin and Wasson 
of the Plebe Class when called upon responded 
with very able remarks. The Society then 
adjourned to the lunch room where a bounti­
ful repast awaited them. With Mr. Hender­
son as toastmaster, after dinner talks com­
pleted the program. Director Hammerschlag 
in a few well chosen words congratulated the 
society upon the good work already accom­
plished and left no doubt in the minds of the 
members present that their efforts in behalf 
of the society were appreciated. Mr. Hokan- 
son spoke of the benefits derived by associa­
tion after graduating. A C. E. graduate of 
Columbia spoke of the advantages Tech has 
over other colleges in its equipment and na­
tural surroundings. Different members of the 
society and Plebe Class responded with brief 
but interesting talks 011 matters pertaining to 
the school. The entire program was indeed 
a success and indicated clearly that the C. E. 
Society now closing is second year is as yet in 
its infancy.
JUNIORS HOLD ELECTION.
The Junior class held its spring election of 
officers last Friday afternoon, there being a 
quorum present 011 this the second attempt 
to hold an election. The only contests were 
for the President and Vice President. Wat- 
rous was the successful aspirant for president-, 
ial honors and Ramp was eleced vice presi­
dent. Exline and Chancellor were elected sec­
retary and treasurer respectively by aclama- 
tion.

Fear not gentle stranger this warlike per­
sonage you see as you emerge from the com­
mons is not the watchdog of the treasury. He 
cares not whether you have procured your 
check from the cashier or not. He is not in­
terested in the all schools book, neither does 
he care whether the class-day speeches are 
made at the senior breakfast or on the new 
Tech field. Whether the Margaret Morrison 
girls should entertain trhe 1908 class or
whether members of the faculty renig 011 the 
Wednesday afternoon hops, in favor of the 
ball game are no concerns of his. Even though 
Prof. Keller puts the Kibosh on the “im­
mortal” Basset (with one T) at the noonday 
game of chess and Prof. Hornbostel wins the
W. U. P. competition. Yet is his calm de­
meanor undisturbed in the latter case at least, nearly so.
Who would recognize in this gladiatorial 
pose the peacemaker at the mill pulled off 
at “Spider” HornbosteFs club or the per­
sonification of hospitality and ambassador 
extra (dry) ordinary at the institution dedica­
tion. It would more strongly suggest the 
mailed fist and the boiler makers grip. But 
again fear not! for it is only Martin Hokan- 
son, C.E., Assistant Professor of Strength of 
Materials and Hydraulics waiting for the Di­
rector to serve at tennis. The boiler maker’s 
grip will only be in evidence for the instant 
you allow your hand to repose in his, if this 
use of the term repose be permissible.
J. E. T. SHUMAN, 3911 Forbes street, opposite 
the Oakland M. E. Church, is in the dry cleaning 
business to please the customer. Send your next 
suit.
His methods of restoring order when riot 
reigns smack of the moral suasion type and 
the pathos with which he tells the story of 
the Swiss Athlete would cause Olga Nether- 
sole to weep with shame and tear drops 
glisten in the eyes of the most hardened cul­
prits. He has qualified in semi-finals and 
finals as our representative in all events pull­
ed off under O. F. S. (Open Face Suit) rules 
and holds records that, we believe, will stand 
for some time to come, in the barn dance.
His favorite article of faith is that if a man 
be capable of evolving and consummating one 
original idea his education is not in vain. From 
the deference accorded him by engineers and 
their willingness to seek his counsel in matters 
pertaining to concrete construction we can 
say with all sinceriy that Tech may look to 
him to evolve not one, but many original ideas.
-----------o-----------
COSGROVE TO HELP COACH.
Mr. Wallace B. Cosgrove, Princeton, ’04, 
who played shortstop 011 the Princeton ’Var­
sity team for four years, in which time he was 
a member of three championship teams, has 
signified his willingness to assist Coach Wolf 
in moulding the base-ball men into form. Mr. 
Cosgrove coached at Princeton last year and 
every endeavor was made to induce him to 
return this year, but owing to the press of busi­
ness, he was unable to do so. He has “all 
kinds” of ginger and should be able to help the 
men out greatly.
-----------o-----------
Already prospective graduates from the 
Senior Class have been successful in securing 
positions which, owing to the present financial 
stringency, can be considered as evidence of 
the fact that engineering firms have faith in 
the preparation given to Tech men.

THE THISTLE APPEARS.
The 1908 Annual, “The Thistle,” which 
caused such a bitter controversy, has at last 
appeared, after having been in process of com­
pilation but three weeks. The editorial and 
business staff are to be complimented on the 
character of the work that they have been able 
to produce in so short a period of time. The 
greater part of the responsibility was upon the 
shoulders of Walter Gray, who acted as Edi- 
tor-in-Chief, and Benjamin Watrous, who effi­
ciently held the position of Business Manager, 
and these men are now receiving the congrat­
ulations of all.
The book is much larger than that of the 
two previous years, and has departed from the 
well fixed lines observed by the editors of the 
preceeding books. The volume is bound in 
gray silk with a strip of Tartan plaid silk across 
the corner, and with the large C. T. S. mono­
gram forming the central figure. Some ex-* 
ceedingly well drawn cartoons and cleverlv 
written articles appear in the work, conspicu­
ous among which is the short biography of 
John A. Brashear, to whom the book is dedi­
cated. The price, one dollar and a half, is the 
same as in previous years. Copies may be se­
cured at the store room.--------0---------
ARCHITECTS SEND IN PROBLEM.
The students in the Department of Archi­
tecture sent in to the Beaux Arts Society of 
New York about fifty-five good drawings last 
Sunday on the Class B Plan and Order Prob­
lems. Competent critics are of the belief that 
the result of the Society’s judgment will show 
Tech to be up to her former -standard. The 
Plan Problem was “An Aquarium,” and the 
order problem “A11 Arcade to an Office Build­
ing.” Miss Knox’s work was especially good, 
and it seems certain that she will land a place. 
The Class A Plan and Order Problems and the 
Archaeology Problems are to be sent in on 
next Sunday.---------o---------
The other day during the lecture in elec­
tricity one of the noted (for what?) students 
of Section C highly entertained the entire 
class by explaining to Mr. Wurts the Gramme 
Ring.* * *
It is with great regret that the Tartan re­
cords the first substantiated case of plagarism 
by a member of the Faculty. Professor Sill, 
we are sorry to say, was the offender. It is 
urged in his favor that he was in ignorance 
of the fact that the water analogy was a copy­
righted expression. He has promised not to 
offend again.
All good students are photographed by

Dr. Hamerschlag visited New York and 
Washington during the early part of the week.
We learn that “Pete” Adams, ex-09, a 
former Tech foot-ball and base-ball star, is 
the proud father of a bouncing baby girl. At 
last reports both mother and child were doing 
well.
On Sunday evening. May 17th, Dr. and 
Mrs. Hamerschlag will entertain the Senior 
Class at their Forbes street home.
We understand that the Pioneer Tech
Club and Woodlawn Cottage Club will play 
their annual series of base-ball games in the 
near future.
The invitations for the Senior Ball to be 
held at the Rittenhouse 011 June Toth will be 
distributed on to-morrow or the day follow- ing.

1909.
The demonstration in gymnastics, given 
by the girls of the Margaret Morrison Carne­
gie School on Saturday, the 9th of May, was 
a great success. The dances were all very 
well performed and it speaks well for the work 
done under the supervision of our clever in­
structress, Miss Stoner. The program was 
as follows:
Minuet and country dance............Juniors
May Pole Dance...............................Plebes
Gavotte ......................................^ight Class
Swedish Days Order...................Juniors
Arm Movements and Dance Steps.
Plebes
Vaulting.......................Plebes and Juniors
Tarantella and Couple-dances. ... Plebes 
Booms and Serpentine. .Juniors & Plebes
Days Order ........................................Plebes
Cupid's Dance ..................................Juniors
Centre Ball.......................Juniors vs. Plebes
Reigen ...................... . Plebes of C and X
Basket-Ball.....................Juniors vs. Plebes
The Reigen was a new dance, composed 
by Miss Stoner; it seemed to be the favorite 
of the evening, and deserved the applause 
given it.
In center-ball the Plebes won a victory by 
a score of five to three; but the result was re­
versed in basket-ball. After a well put up 
fight on both sides the Juniors won will a score 
of six against the Plebes’ three.
The gymnasium was crowded to its ut­
most ; many people stood in the hall, and some 
had to be turned away, we are sorry to say, 
as they came without tickets, as there was not 
room for all the ticket-holders.

Purdue Students Give Ade Play.
The “Fair Co-Ed” is the name of a play produced 
lately by a comppany of sixty Purdue men at the 
Grand Opera House of La Fayette. The play is a 
musical comedy, written especially for the Purdue 
students by Geo -ge Ade, the noted playright of In­
diana. The production was enthusiastically received 
by a large audience.
The only difference between a rut and the grave 
is the length and breadth.
