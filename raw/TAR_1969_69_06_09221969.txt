Dr. Norman Johnson, direc­
tor of the Carnegie-Mellon Action 
Program (C-MAP) presented him­
self before the “Firing Line,” 
urged by the challenges of stu­
dents and faculty, and administra­
tion, a relatively small percentage 
of each, gathered in the ball­
room for the “Firing Line.” 
“Firing Line” is a new program 
sponsored by the YM-YWCA, en­
couraging free discussion of cam­
pus issues. After a brief introduc­
tion concerning the philosophies 
of C-MAP, a student panel, Ed 
Deci, Dan Nagin, Sylvia Wil­
son, Steve Hoffman, Andy Al­
ston, and A1 Fiegenbaum, met 
with Dr. Johnson, uncovering 
facts and policies behind the Ac­
tion Program and dealing with con- 
tempoarary black — white issues.
“We are NOT trying to build 
distances between people,” 
emphasized Dr. Johnson. C-MAP 
stands initially as a vehicle for 
significantly increasing the num­
ber of students on the CMU cam­
pus. The ideology underlying move­

Approximately 200 students, 
faculty and construction work­
ers attended a rally Monday 
morning on the cut in support of 
the BCC.
After David Caney, a student 
organizer of the rally read 
President Stever’s statement, 
Leonard Rapping, GS1A profes­
sor, addressed the crowd.
“We believe although the 
problem is clear cut (i.e., there 
is discrimination) the solution 
will be vast and complex,” he 
said. “If you are not part of the 
solution, you are part of the 
problem.

tired, worn assumption. “For too 
long, when discussing poor people 
in society, particularly the
blacks,, these poor people were 
considered defficient and defec­
tive.” It was believed that so­
ciety must improve and change 
them. The many remedial pro­
grams that developed did not suc­
ceed in their purpose. Carnegie 
had a new idea. “Poor people, 
particularly blacks, can suc­
ceed in the already existing sys- 
. tem. This is a positive light.”
New students entered in the 
School of Humanities and So­
cial Sciences in the fall of 1968. 
In that school year, the program 
was a moderate success. Action 
students performed at an equal 
level to other students, without 
nullifying living institutions 
at CMU.
For the 1969-70 school year, 
the number of students in C-MAP 
has been increased. The Action 
participants are dispersed through 
all of the colleges in the univer­
sity, rather than concentrated in 
one school.
student leader, said. “The admin­
istration shut down the construc­
tion sites just because of a 
threat of a demonstration. We 
could have had two demonstra­
tors and 60-rent a cops. We al­
most expected to say the Rent- 
A-Cops support the BCC,” he 
continued.
“It doesn’t mean anything un­
til it costs someone money,” 
Caney continued. “We must keep 
construction closed until there is 
a negotiation break through.”
The leaders explained that they 
were not going to act until 
they received word from the 
BCC. “If the BCC moves, we re 
going to move.”

As a result of last week’s re­
solutions submitted by the Fac­
ulty and Student Senate to Presi­
dent Stever, the committee cal­
led for by Stever’s September 
15 statement met to discuss what 
the University would do in the 
event of a demonstration and what 
future policy on construction the 
University wilHollow.
The Committee recommended 
to Stever when he returned 
Friday that (1) if there is a dem­
onstration, the University should 
give strong consideration to shut­
ting down the sites for safety rea­
sons, (2) that a statement should be 
made that the site was closed 
down because of the filures of 
the negotiations to reach a settle­
ment and in support of the BCC,
(3) that the University request an 
inspection of building projects to 
determine whether we are act­
ing in compliance with federal 
laws, and (4) the institution should 
define “compliance” and “equal” 
“opportunity.”
President Stever, after meet­
ing with the Policy Advisory 
Board Saturday morning and 
the Trustees in the afternoon, 
decided to issue the following 
statement.
“The President has called a 
special meeting for students and 
faculty for 10:30 a.m. Monday, 
September 22, in the gymnasium.
“The purpose of the meeting is 
to communicate the administra­
tion’s analysis of CMU’s rela­
tion ship to the problem in the 
Pittsburgh construction industry 
and to initiate a free and open 
discussion on the campus.
Classes scheduled for 10:30
a.m. and 11:30 a.m. have been 
cancelled.”
Monday morning it was an­
nounced that “to create the proper 
atmosphere for campus dialogue on 
this important topic, a one-day 
moratorium has been declared for
“We need only 20 people to seal 
off the three access roads to the 
Computation Building,” they 
continued.
The students called for people 
to help inform the campus of 
any further demonstrations.
President Stever addressed a 
crowd of about 1500 in the gym 
at 10:30. With TV cameras 
glaring at him. Stever opened his 
remarks by saying, “For those of 
you who don’t know me, my 
name is Stever, and I’m the Presi­
dent of Carnegie-Mellon Uni­
versity.”
Stever recited the background 
of the present situation, saving

Despite the Administration’s 
statement, the leaders of 
Monday’s demonstration and rally 
planned to hold their show of sup­
port, adjourning the meeting to 
attend President Stever’s convoca­
tion in the guym.
They did not answer whether 
or not there will be an attempt­
ed shut-down of the site on Tues­
day although, “certainly, the is­
sue is not closed or solved here.”
FBCC MEETS
In an effort to co-ordinate de­
monstrations throughout the city 
in support of the Black Construc­
tion Coalition, ten C-MU stu­
dents met with the Friends of 
the Black Coalition Thi^rsday 
night. The meeting was attend­
ed by Hal Robinson of Bid- 
well and representatives from 
teachers unions, several wards, 
church groups and other city 
universities. Byrd Brown and 
Nate Smith, coalition leaders, 
also attended.
The meeting commenced with 
an explanation of the Friends’ 
purpose. “We have the single 
purpose of supporting the Coali­
tion,” the Chairman stated. “To 
date, we are responding to their 
requests, and not initiating any 
action on our own.”
“As the Coalition leaders are 
busy negotiating,” one member 
commented, “the white com­
munity has the time to put pres-

April elections ... all other seats 
are open for one year terms.

seats will be available in Skibo 
103 on October 13.
To run for Senator, a candidate 
must be a full time undergradu­
ate or graduate student. He must 
be a member of a constituency

Hal Robinson explained that 
the BCC was operating on a con-, 
sensus basis which makes it dif­
ficult to reach any kind of con­
clusions on what the Coalition 
should do next. “Some Coali­
tion members are being careful 
about white support, some trust 
students and some do not, some 
are for integration, and some 
distrust whites for being all talk 
and no action,” he said.
“It is the thought of the BCC 
that this will grow into a national 
movement,” he added.

Nixon Proclaims 
Reduced Draft
by CHUCK DALY
In a special White House press conference held September 19, 
President Nixon cut the draft calls for November and December to
10,000 men each month. This was accomplished by spreading the Oc­
tober call of 29,000 men among three months. Tied with this proclama­
tion was Nixon’s statement that if his efforts at legislative reform of 
the current Selective Service procedure are not fruitful, he will is­
sue an executive order tq, institute new provisions which would hope 
fully eliminate some of the present inequities of the draft laws.
In timing the release of the announcement of the cut, Nixon 
choose a time at which colleges around the nation are reconvening. 
There is speculation that the notice is an attempt to quiet the anti­
war factions which have shaken the nation in the past few years, 
particularly from their positions on college campuses.
The legislative endeavors of the administration are pointed at 
the repeal of the legal statute which currently takes the oldest quali­
fied men before considering the lower age groups. This prevents the 
random selection of draftees as favored by the administration.
> If Congress does not approve the legislative package proposed by 
the administration by the end of the current session, Nixon plans to 
issue an executive edict which would make the 19-year-olds the prime 
target group for the Selective Service Svstem.
LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Defense Secretary Melvin Laird explained that the plan would 
work following these guidelines:
A prime selection group would be established which would con­
sist of 19-year-olds and oldermen whose deferments had expired. In 
the first year of the program, the age group from 20 to 25 would be 
included in the prime-selection category.
No one would be in the prime-selection category for longer than 
one year, although after this period of prime exposure a young man 
would still be liable to the draft if he had not been drafted during 
his prime exposure interim.
The draftees would be selected each month from 19-year-olds on 
an “Oldest-first” basis. Since the prime age group would change each 
'month, the new proposal would avoid concentration of induction 
notices on those who were born in one of the first months of a parti­
cular year.
In a College Press Service release of Sept. 17, 1969, an unidenti­
fied White House official said that Nixon has two alternatives regard­
ing a change in the draft laws:
He could enact an order for a conveyor belt system in which all 
young men would be subject to the draft only at the age of 19. Those 
not taken by the time of their 20th birthday would be free from con­
scription.
By the same means, Nixon could issue a plan by which all turn­
ing twenty in a particular year would be vulnerable to conscription in 
an "oldest first" order, along with those whose deferments had ex­
pired. A person born in January would thus be more vulnerable to 
the draft than those born in December of the same year.

White Justice 
At C-MU
White Justice prevails at C- 
MU’s Research Computer Build­
ing. One would think with the ad­
vancements in engineering and re­
lated fields there would also be 
advancements toward equal op­
portunity employment. It’s true, 
C-MU hired me, a qualified 
Black American, as the Project 
Inspector for construction of the 
research computer building, buy 
why? I did not fail in my re­
sponsibilities, yet my immediate 
superior instructed me to waly 
away from a critical situation on 
the job, which I would not do. 
Prior to this specific incident, 
and continuing until I applied 
for a transfer, I was pressured and 
harassed, by lies, scandal and en­
trapment by my immediate 
superior. This problem was not 
ignored by his superior; sure, we 
had a conference. But were my 
words given consideration? Yes, 
the same consideration any black 
man would receive under white 
justice. Personality conflict was 
the verdict, or otherwise let by­
gones be by-gones, gones, and try 
to get along for a month together, 
with me on probation of course. 
I was also given the option of 
transfering. What would you do? 
I want to appeal not to individual 
outsiders or the Black Colai- 
tion, but rather to the persons on 
campus that society on campus has 
seen fit to criticize, ridicule, and 
sometimes hate, because you are 
not trapped in the merry-go 
round of the socalles society. 
Real justice, white man’s and 
black’s will prevail, when you 
take action. Every effort by you, 
helps in an individual’s struggle, 
whether he be black or white, 
to receive his just consideration.

There is a vast difference be­
tween black workers and the 
Black Coalition. Black workers 
have low incomes, poor housing, 
and little job security. The Coal­
ition leaders are highly paid, live 
well nad have good job security 
and job mobility. These Coali­
tion leaders are only willing to 
use the great power that militant 
black workers have only when the
rank and file members expose 
the leaders as doing nothing to 
the public.
Poor black workers cannot af­
ford to take a day off from 
their minimum wage job to pro­
test every time the so-called lead­
ers want some attention getting 
device to publicize what they are 
doing. Only when the rank and 
file workers organize them­
selves will they break into the 
unions. If the negotiations get any­
where, it is because the union 
leaders, mayor, and coalition 
leaders see that the Black work­
ers won’t be easily put down and 
not because the coalition leaders 
played their cards right at the 
negotiations.

OK, so shutting the construc­

versity’s educational goals — I 
can gas on that — I don’t agree 
myself and I’ll be there trying 
to close it if Stever doesn’t 
propose any concrete future ac­
tion like a Federal investiga­
tion and a new strong policy on 
further construction. So I don’t 
agree with the content of the ac­
tions yet, but I do agree with the 
process — very much so. I mean 
closing the construction for a 
day, cancelling classes, and cal­
ling a series of meetings is a great 
thing to do. The first meeting 
may not have come off so well — 
but maybe the afternoon ones 
will — perhaps with more ra­

dialogue over monologue — per­

Youths Fare 
Up Slightly
Airline youth fares will con­
tinue, but not at the current half- 
price discount. The Civil Aeron­
autics Board decided last month 
that while the fares, which enable 
persons 12-22 to fly standby at 
low cost, were fair in parinciple,
airlines should be allowed to raise 
them to 60 per cent of the regu­
lar coach fare. Recently added 
expenxes have forced airlines to 
change the discount rates in or­
der to increase their profits. The 
new higher rates will take effect 
October 1.
The youth fare issue was forc­
ed to a head last January when 
several bus companies, all of 
which lost business to the air­
lines on account of the fares, filed 
suit to make the CAB listen to 
their arguments that the discounts 
were illegal. CAB examiner Ar­
thur S. Present recommended the 
fares be abolished, but the board 
delayed action when protest was 
registered by the National Stu­

Disgust and 
Disappointment
Editor, The Tartan:
It is with outright disgust and 
disappointment at your Septem­
ber 19 issue that we write this 
letter.
Specifically, the article on 
page 4, “The Student as Nigger” 
by Jerry Farber, was an uncal- 
led-for piece of literary trash 
that should have been below the 
quality of the campus paper of 
Carnegie-Mellon University.
Your printing of such a base 
and inferior article seems to im­
ply that the standard of the Tar­
tan is on the decline or at the pit 
of literary decay.
Mr. Farber apparantly feels 
provocative language appeals to 
the student. Well it is our op­
inion that the article was a waste 
of paper and only created a feel­
ing of nausea and extreme dis­
gust.
We feel this article should not 
be hung anywhere, rather it should 
be discarded or burned.
We would appreciate it if the 
Tartan would try to improve its 
tastes and cover campus ma­
terial in a way that would make 
us proud to be students of Car­
negie Mellon University.
Thank You.

True, it may be justified: however, 
the following conditions are even 
more undesirable concerning the

items behind the counter.
2. The unreasonable charge of 
25 cents for one-eighth of a pie 
when a similar whole pie can be 
purchased for 69 cents or
less.
3. The unreasonable charge of 
20 cents for a small piece of cake.
4. The frequent closing off of a 
large portion of the tables, even 
when closing time is hours away.
5. The frequent closing off of 
one of the lines causing bottle 
necks.
6. The occasional locking of 
outside doors before closing time.7 .-------------------------------------------

Joel Goldstein, Assistant Professor of Psychology
Objections Made 
To Drug Policy
by CHUCK DALY
Those student readers who attended C-MU last year will no 
doubt remember the drug survey conducted by Dr. Joel Goldstein 
and his Psychology Department associates. Although Dr. Goldstein 
has no results from the survey to be published at this time (A pre­
liminary report will be available to the student body in December!
I found his arguments on government attempts at control of the drug 
market quite compelling.
In its most recent attack on drug abuse, the Federal government 
has proposed new enforcement measures which would effect a di­
minished supply of marijuana in the II.S. black market. This is done 
with hope that cutting off sources of the controversial week will raise 
prices to a level at which few can afford to buy.
Dr. Goldstein objects to this approach as a misguided attempt 
to lower the drug use level. He bases his argument on what I feel tp 
be the well-founded fear that a dminished supply of marijuana might 
lead to an increased consumption of more potent and more danger­
ous drugs.
Parallel to this is another danger. Dr. Goldstein asserts. The 
danger of pushing marijuana users to seek new sources of supply, 
thus exposing them to possible misrepresentation of a substance. 
At a recent American Psychological Association seminar on psycho­
active drugs which Dr. Goldstein chaired. It was revealed by a Cana­
dian research team that 80 per cent of the drugs which they obtained 
on the streets were not what they were represented to be. The deaths 
and injuries resulting from bad drugs would probably rise rapidly as 
a result of any shift of supply to unknown street dealers.
Dr. Goldstein vehemently rejects government attempts at elimina­
ting the availability of drugs to valid research programs. "The approach 
which eliminates even medical research is absurd." he states. "Not 
nearly enough therapeautic research is being conducted now."
As an alternative to more stringent control of the drug market. 
Dr. Goldstein endorses a bill introduced in Congress by Senator 
Yarborough which would offer help rather than vent anger. The pro­
posal would appropriate $200 million for the construction of treatment 
facilities and would provide additional subsidies for legitimate re­
search projects. Marijuana, in this bill, would be removed from Inter­
nal Revenue Service coverage and placed within the jurisdiction of the 
Department of Health. Education and Welfare, which could then sup­
port research dealing with the nature of the weed.
Grants would also be made under this bill for the collection and 
dissemination of educational material based on results of research. 
This would aid in the elimination of the "credibility gap' existing 
between the population on issues in which drugs were involved. As 
Dr. Goldstein remarks. "Some people no longer believe the govern­
ment because it has lied to them in the past — in calling marijuana 
a narcotic and in other issues on drugs.

At the opening of the Student Senate on 
Sept. 2. so many senators had found good excuses 
for not coming that it was not until the usual num­
ber of latecomers had stranggled in that a quor­
um was reached. Nothing of any importance was 
discussed, save something vague about Skibo policy 
concerning non-student-faculty-staff.
Things began happening on the 16th. however. 
By this time most of the members had found out 
where the senate meetings were being held, and 
managed to attend. It was announced that the 
Sailing Club's request for $800 for two sailboats 
had been turned down by the Finance Com­
mittee. for one reason or another. Contrary to com­
mittee opinion, the Sailing Club cannot practice 
with paper boats. The Committee was good enough 
to reconsider the request for funds at the urging, 
of a Sailing Club member.
A question addressed to the Housing Committee 
concerning the housing problem evinced the pro­
found reply. "Well, there are just too many stu­
dents . . ." Most residents of Webster Hall are ex­
pected to be moved onto campus around the end 
of the month.

largement of the budgets. Perhaps if no attention 
is played to the problem it will go away . . .
Michael Armentrout attempted to slap the wrist 
of the Administration with his open letter. It is 
not that Armentrout does not like President Stever 
to open his mouth. The gist of the letter was that 
a dissertation on what happens if a riot comes along 
is something like informing students what to do 
should a meteor hit Warner Hall. President Stever, 
insisted Mr. Armentrout. could have wasted his 
breath on a topic of more immediacy, such as the 
housing problem.
The real plum of the September 16th session, 
of course, was the Senate’s open letter concerning 
the Black Coalition. The letter merits a great deal 
of consideration from the Administration. In the 
first place, it is cognizant of the fact that the 
University either cannot, or should not. pay $25. 
000 a day in labor wages and machine rental costs 
while work is stopped. (That is, if C-MU makes 
the halt voluntarily.) The Seante’s letter also de­
lineates a plan which would be both effective and 
ecconomical for the University to follow, provid­
ed Pitt and Duquesne also seek court injunctions 
to halt their own construction.

that he had appealed to many 
people for advice, 'searching 
for the proper course of action."
"To insure a free and open 
discussion today I have called 
for a one day moratorium on the 
construction of the Computation 
Building and the fraternity com­
plex." Stever continued.
He stated that the University 
had declared its moral stand on 
the issue as being against discrim­
inatory practices in the construc­
tion unions. "I believe the Uni­
versity must have a moral posi­
tion. but we must also be care­
ful in respect to political actions, 
the President stated
"We have been asked to take 
political actions." Stever con­
tinued. "The University's purpose 
is education. That is what we 
are chartered to do."

ence including luncheon is $10.00

Stever further stated that one of 
the nice things about his job — 
"and not everything about this 
job is nice'' — is that he has had 
to face more directly the practical­
ities of those moral issues.
Several options were open to 
the University. We could have 
ignored everything. Stever said, 
but it would have "cost us dear­
ly" in support.
Stever said that the Univer­
sity must look at things in terms 
of the future. Students, he con­
tinued, tend to look at these is­
sues frohi a short-range standpoint.
The President mentioned a re­
cent Tartan article and said 
that he was misquoted as saying 
that our hiring practices are not 
just. What he had said, he con­
tinued. was that they were not 
operationally just
The fact that the University 
requires resources to improve 
the campus situation was mentioned
‘ Our number one goal is educa­
tion." Stever continued. ‘‘By 
closing construction, we are not 
taking political action on either 
side."
"The building shut down does 
not indicate political action,” 
Stever repeated many times 
during the discussion ‘The 
workers must be paid for today.
It is expensive. It is costing us 
mavbe five (’-MAP students or 
one professor.”
We are prepared to ask the 
federal government for a re-ex­
amination of our sites, Stever 
continued. ‘ We are prepared to 
examine all of our actions,” he 
said.
Stever also commented that he 
has been told by some students 
that they will try to shut down con­
struction operations. As many in 
the audience clapped, Stever con­
tinued that "we must protect 
the regulation and function of 
the University ”
Before asking for questions on 
the floor, Stever said that today’s 
moratorijm was not our option. 
It came from one member of 
the Policy Advisory Board and 
"we thought it would be a good 
idea.”
One student commented that if 
we can take a moral stand in 
favor of integration, how can we 
take a different practical stand.
Another member of the au­
dience said it is not a political 
action to police your own ter­
ritory. "We are not asking you to 
dress up in academic regalia and 
march downtown,” he said.
Professor Rapping remarked 
that “C-MU does, in fact, en­
gage in those kinds of actions in 
support of education. He added 
that we are a tax-exempt institu­
tion because we are ‘‘not involved 
in politics.”
President Stever added a note 
of comedy to the proceedings 
by calling on a ‘‘young lady” — 
who turned out to be Steven 
Lawrence.
Stever commented that ‘ in­
dividuals can speak out as they 
would like but hot in thé name of 
the University.”
One girl in the audience stood 
up in support of Dr. Stever.
“Why don’t you do things the 
right way,” she said. “Not just 
marching, yelling and screaming.”
Stever pointed out that that 
is the nub of the question — what 
is the right way.
The meeting adjourned with 
announcements of departmental 
meetings Monday afternoon to 
continue the discussions — 
and perhaps find the right way.

Luncheon F^rum
Kerr, Hagopian Point Out Draft Inequity
by MURRY SINGER
The second in the weekly series of Thursday noon­
time discussions sponsored by the “Y” featured an in­
teresting and sometimes frightening examination of the 
military draft and its implications. The two speak­
ers, Tom Kerr, a Pittsburgh attorney, and the Rev. 
Ralph Hagopian, a clergyman who is the founder 
and director of the area’s draft counselling program, 
made very clear the inequity and perhaps the illegal­
ity of our conscription procedures. The talks took on 
added significance when it was announced later the 
same day that the November and December draft calls 
had been cancelled.
Kerr Opened with the .statement that, “Compulsory 
military conscription is a deprivation of liberty.” Al­
though the American Constitution guarantees that the 
citizen won’t be deprived of his liberty without due 
process of law, servicemen not only must sacrifice 
their own liberty for two years whether they wish to or 
not, but are also deprived of property, since they are 
paid a wage far lower than the one they would re­
ceive on the open labor market. Furthermore, although 
a legal review of conscription performed in 1918 sup­
ported the concept of a war time draft, Supreme Court 
Justice Douglas has indicated that the question of 
whether a peacetime draft is indeed legal should be 
examined.
Kerr then passed from the problem of overall le­
gality to that of the more specific travesities which are 
perpetrated by our military draft system. (The list is 
extensive.) When a young laddie is called to arms, there 
is no procedure of appeal that he can follow that 
vaguely resembles a legal hearing. The American 
Bar Association has pointed out that a businessman ap­
plying for a pexmit to haul junk from one city to an­
other gets a far more complete opportunity to state his 
case.
Furthermore, all decisions of the local draft boards 
are made in secret, and the individual has no idea of 
when he himself is being discussed. Rev. Hagopian
cited the case of a student who was willing to be in­
ducted, but who wanted to know before the school 
year began whether this would occur. His local board 
could not give him the information, and he was 
subsequently drafted after several months of work, 
which, because of the nature of his program, was was­
ted.
Some aspects of the draft have already been sub­
jected to legal scrutiny. Two years ago, the Supreme
Court overruled the delinquency requirement whereby 
local boards could advance the names of known “dis­
senters” in the order of call. In 1965, a draftee was 
granted conscientious objector status although he did 
not subscribe to any traditional religion. (Legal road­
blocks have been more recently established to prevent 
the others from using the precedent set by this ruling.)
TOM KERR
The composition of the 4100 local boards, highly white, 
middle-aged, and veteran, has biased the decisions 
achieved, and this problem has been augmented by the 
fact that most board members see military service as a 
desirable and patriotic duty.
Some of the injustices discussed border on the ab­
surd. When a notice is sent out by a local board, fail­
ure to comply with its demands is not refutable on the 
basis of the fact that the notice was not received. Kerr 
suggested that the best way to make the draft (if one 
must exist) more fair is by constant legal “nibbling” 
at its inequities. Other of his recommendations in­
cluded requiring that the proceedings of the draft 
boards be made public, and equalizing the represen­
tation of different groups on these boards.
Rev. Hagopian also made several important points 
He discussed General Hershey’s concept of “chan­
neling,” or “making use” of the excessive number of 
available youths for government purposed. Essentially, 
what occurs is that the military is given liscense to use 
large quantities of manpower as it or the government 
sees fit, with no respect for the opinions or the desires 
of the individuals involved.
The draft, as it now exists, has several damaging 
consequences other than the most obvious ones. It 
places youths in a position of uncertainty as to their 
future at a time in their lives when it is most import­
ant to be able to plan ahead. At 19, a male eligible for 
the draft does not know whether he will be called in six 
months or three years (if at all). Rev. Hagopian also 
discussed the many strenuous and ingenious efforts 
which have been made in order to avoid military ser­
vice, and pointed out the tragedy of this waste of en­
ergy in the light of the pressing problems of our society 
and the attention which they demand.
The question and answer period involved fairly 
specific points which needed clarification. The hour 
was very educational in that, for this reporter, it provid­
ed useful detail to complement the emotional feeling 
that the draft is at best, an unfair system.

Meeting at Pitt 
Against ROTC 
Decision Later
by CHUCK DALY
The third meeting of the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh Arts and 
Sciences Faculty Committee on 
ROTC credit concluded with­
out a verdict. The two most no­
table speakers, Dr. Edward Arnett 
of the Science Department, and 
Dr. Donald Petesch, testified in 
opposition to the inclusion of 
ROTC in the College’s cur­
riculum.
Dr. Arnett asked for the ex­
clusion of ROTC from the 
campus, pointing to his opinion 
that the presence of a military 
course threatens the “freedom 
and dignity” of the University.
Dr. Petesch read several sec­
tions of an ROTC Instruc­
tion manual to point to the way 
the military trains its members 
to function by habit. He con­
cluded that this habitual type of 
thought would hamper the learn­
ing process which should be func­
tioning in a Liberal Arts Cur­
riculum.
It was announced that a decis­
ion would be made at a later 
date concerning the future of 
ROTC at Pitt. The postponement 
of the decision is a result of ef­
forts by the committee to hear 
viewpoints from all interested 
parties.

Mayoralty Candidates 
Debate Discrimination
In the first of eight scheduled 
public debates between the two 
candidates in the mayoralty race 
of Pittsburgh, the hopefuls ex­
pounded their beliefs on the job 
discrimination crises which faces 
this city. Although neither 
candidate came out with a strong 
statement on one side or the other, 
both stressed their desires for equal 
opportunity employment.
John Tabor, the GOP hopeful, 
stating his interest in the prob­
lem as the former State Secretary 
of Labor and Industry, also spoke 
of his desire to seek out qualified 
men for construction jobs regard­
less of color.
Pete Flaherty, the Democratic 
Independent candidate stated 
the first step was to recognize 
the worng. He feels that this has 
not yet been done. “The mayor of 
this city must bring them together,” 
Mr. Flaherty stated. “We must de­
vise a continuing program to per­
mit those who have been discrim­
inated against to move up the 
ladder to equal job opportun­
ities.”
Other segments of the debate 
considered such issues as mass 
transit, housing, taxes and pub­
lic safety.

Dr. Johnson
(Continued from Page 1)
The success of C-MAP is fa­
cilitated by two programs. The 
use of teacher-counselors advis­
es Action students and works 
with various problems confront­
ing them. Learning seminars con­
centrate on socializing factors 
and study skills. The seminar 
introduces and underlines “giv­
en realities” in college environ­
ments. With a half smile, Dr. 
Johnson added, “many rituals ex­
ist in college life. Our students 
must lear to distinguish the sub­
stance from the ritual so they 
don’t get all hung up.” Dr. John­
son stated that students, further­
more, should be aware of the 
games played within colleges. 
The teacher-counselor and the 
learning seminar orient C-MAP 
students to skills, as well as 
games, without necessarily modi­
fying programs and departments 
in Carnegie.
C-MAP supports a hope that un­
less students are introduced to 
the diversities of the world, they 
will not be successful leaders. 
“Man needs to draw from the 
reservoir of experience that 
comes from exposure.”
Dan Nagin opened the panel 
discussion, questionning C-MAP’s 
role in the segregation, structural 
and social, existing on campus 
between blacks and whites. It 
was mentioned that all black stu­
dents on campus are not mem­
bers of C-MAP; therefore, the 
movement is not controlled or in­
fluenced by any organization. C-
Jazz Band 
To Begin
Sixth Y ear
The C-MU Concert Jazz Band, 
under the direction of Dennis 
Ferry, is being organized again 
for its sixth year. All those inter­
ested in playing in this student 
activity should watch future issues 
of the TARTAN for further details.
Mr. Ferry, a senior trumpet 
major, would like to use the same 
instrumentation as last year -- 
4 trumpets, 4 trombones, 5 saxes, 
piano, bass, and drums (guitar 
will be added if someone is inter­
ested). The rehearsals will prob­
ably be held Sunday nights at ap­
proximately 6:00 p.m. for two 
hours (or at another time more 
convenient).
All persons interested will be 
considered. The band is espec­
ially in need of alto and tenor 
saxophonists.
Watch the TARTAN for further 
details. In the meanwhile, if 
there are any questions, Mr. Fer­
ry can be reached at 683-4779, 
weekdays: 8:00 - 9:30 a.m., 6:00 
- 8:00 p.m., and Sundays 9:30 - 
12:00 a.m. and after midnight. 
He can be found in the Music 
Dept, during the day. Any notes 
should be left on the Mezzanine 
bulletin board in the Fine Arts 
building.

MAP only encourages its members 
“todo their own thing.”
In response to inquiry on the 
housing policy, Dr. Johnson sta­
ted that administrative measures 
greatly influenced the present 
housing structure. “Decisions 
weren’t drawn on black-.white 
lines. The only stand C-MAP 
took concerned the banding of black 
E&S students on one floor. 
This would serve as a mechanism 
for group cohesion, as well as to 
facilitate academic success.” There 
was much confusion with the 
large number of students requir­
ing housing. “The administration 
needed a plan involving a min­
imal number of changes from 
tentative, earlier arrangements. I 
made the decision to use only 
one floor. I could have had any 
decision I wanted and this,” 
commented Dr. Johnson, “is 
what I chose. It was not a ra­
cial decision.” Female Action 
students are mixed within the 
dorm.
Concerning the choice of E- 
Tower as the home for C-MAP 
boys, Dr. Johnson added that 
this tower was designed for 
freshmen students. A large per­
centage of black students fall in 
this category.
Why CMU? “E&S has tried to 
assist; they have made a large ef­
fort to encourage the increase of 
black students. It is one of CMU’s 
fortes. And a university can 
best participate through its strong­
est asset. In this case, CMU has 
their engineering, department.” 
C-MAP is not funded by any out­
side organization. They are func­
tioning within the existing sys­
tem. “There is no place I would 
like to be better than CMU,” 
said Dr. Johnson.
Responding to an inquiry 
about the C-MAP program in 
other schools in the nation, Dr. 
Johnson suggested that there is a 
strong national interest in this
type of program. There exists 
a similar plan at Southern Illin­
ois University; the basic format of 
ingredients will spread quickly 
across the country.
Stirring the audience, Andy 
Alston directed a question to all, 
asking where was the student body 
who has been so annoyed with 
the policies and plans of C- 
MAP. “The faculty and adminis­
tration have been very co-opera- 
tive, but the students don’t take 
time to find out the real issues. 
Perhaps the outsiders should have 
reviewed this situation.”
Dr. Johnson swept into the dis­
cussion. “The out-group never 
approaches the in-group to say 
‘let me in.’ The in-group is the 
white students, and they have 
not said to the black students, 
‘come in.’ Is not power uneven­
ly distributed in our society? 
Those who do not have the pow­
er just don’t approach the pow­
erful and ask them to surrender 
some of their power.”
At this point, discussion was 
opened to the audience. Again, 
comments were directed toward 
the black and white segregation 
issue. “Blacks and whites have 
a history of hostile contact,” re­
plied Dr. Johnson. “It has pri­
marily been thè white man’s hos­
tility toward the black man. On­
ly recently blacks are saying, “all 
right, shove it’.” Moreover, Dr. 
Johnson said that successful re 
lationships must be based on 
mutual respect. The remedy of 
the situation demands that people 
deal honestly and fairly with each 
other as people. Once this is prop­
erly understood, the black: white 
issue will fall into perspective. 
“Collectively, the whites have 
shown that they have peroga- 
tives over the blacks. White peo­
ple,” continued Dr. Johnson, 
“feel that they can perform at 
will. Black students, involved 
with programs such as C-MAP,
will graduate with a diversity of 
skills to deliver to the outside 
community.”
A white students in the au­
dience introduced herself and her 
case, agreeing that integration is 
a difficult situation. “In all my 
classes combined I have only 
one black student. We must meet 
as individuals rather than as 
groups. We need more contact, and 
I feel that people learn more 
about people by living with 
them.”
“I’ll tell the President to bring 
in three hundred more black stu­
dents next year,” quickly re­
sponded Dr. Johnson. He added 
that before people meet they 
must have something in com­
mon. Man needs functional re­
lationships. “They may never be­
come human relationship, but as 
long as we get the task done 
around this function, that’s cool. 
If you don’t get to the next 
level.... well.... O.K.”
“Tthe black students here at 
this gathering way out-num- 
ber the white students,” declar­
ed a black C-MAP student. 
“Relative to the percentage of 
whites and blacks on campus, 
this really shows where the in­
terest lies. The black girls in 
C-MAP aren’t separated in the 
dormitory, but the only contact 
I have with any white girl is
when I literally bump into one. 
We look at each other and say 
‘excuse me.’”
Later, Dr. Johnson was ques­
tioned concerning the financial 
arrangements made for C-MAP 
students. He explained that C- 
MAP students fill out confidential 
forms like all other students. The 
Financial Aid Office makes all 
the awards. The first year all 
money grants are presented as 
scholarships. The students and 
families incur no future expense 
relative to the first year. In the 
following three years, grants are 
made so that the student is re­
sponsible in terms of loans. The 
loan factor is not present in the 
first year on the proposition that 
most students are poor in C- 
MAP.
Dr. Johnson felt pleased with 
the open discussion on C-MAP.
“This is a good start and we’ll 
talk any time.”

Pittsburgh Radio; 
Stereo Is Best
page 6—THE TARTAN—Tuesday, September 23, 1969
“Boys and Girls Together”
3 Institutions President Withdraws
Charged With 35,000 from Vietnam
Discrimination
by Tom Davis
Pittsburgh, like any other city, 
has a lot of radio stations. On AM 
it is pretty typically jammed with 
screaming disc jockeys playing 
the same songs (and now!!!. . . 
numbah ONE-ONE!!!!) over and 
over and over, ad infinitum. It is 
also stuffed full of religious pro­
grams, country music, and the 
copro-political ravings of H. L. 
Hunt’s professional paranoids.
On FM, surprisingly, there is 
much of the same. But here, you 
have the choice of listening to 
some really nice FM stereo sta­
tions. The classical music buff 
can listen to his station as can the 
jazz fan. But what about the per­
son who likes to listen to nice 
sounds of rock and/or folk mus­
ic?
Last year, over Easter vacation. 
Pittsburgh was “graced by the ar­
rival of Brother Love. Those 
who tuned in to his late-night pro­
gram listened with hearts thump­
ing and sweat rolling. His stent­
orian voice, heard through an echo 
chamber, and the savagest under­
ground music this side of Hash- 
bury, gave the late evening its 
greatest thrill since “Lights .... 
Owwwt!” Brother Love brought 
with him such strangers as Frank 
the Freak, the Observor. and The 
Mellon Square.
Brother Love has since gone on 
to his reward (Boston, I think). 
He has been replaced by Electric 
Porky (the Lectric Boss Man ) and 
his group of Fumbling Ineptitudes.
Then, early this year, a young 
lady named Peggy Reines turned 
me on to a type of programming 
coming over the local screamer 
station’s FM branch. Besides 
coming in stereo, it played really 
good music. Not just underground, 
but R&B, folk, and just generally 
the good sounds. It's beautiful.

Students Use 
Paper Plates
Some Penn State University stu­
dents have been eating their late 
summer meals off paper plates, 
using paper utensils.
The austerity kick began sever­
al weeks ago when selected stu­
dents received a package of paper 
dishes, including a cereal bowl, 
dinner plate, dessert plate and 
plastic knife, fork and spoon.
They had received a letter ask­
ing them to try out the dishes at 
home and then give their candid 
opinions about the use of the dish­
es in campus dining halls for the 
breakfast meal.
Robert C. Proffitt, associate 
director of the Dept, of Housing 
and Food Service at Penn State, 
explained that the use of dispos­
able dishes would help meet a per­
sonnel shortage.
Students responded at great 
length-nearlv all of them giving 
approval. However, now Mr. Pro­
ffitt says it may not be necessary 
to turn to the disposable dishes, 
at least not for the fall term open­
ing this week.
Blacks, Whites 
Hold Differing 
Views on Nixon
by Allan Henderson
According to a recent Gallop 
Poll. Blacks and Whites have op­
posing views on how Richard Nix­
on is handling the job of Presi­
dent.
Almost twice as many Whites 
approve of his handling of the job 
as Blacks and nearly twice as 
ny Blacks disapprove as 
whites.
The following question was ask­
ed of 9021 adults over a three- 
month period to determine the dif­
ference in attitudes toward the 
President's overall performance:
Do you approve or disapprove of 
the way Nixon is handling his job 
as President?
The findings below are the results:
Approve........................38' < 65((
Disapprove................31% 16'r
No Opinion....................31'< 19' <
The results of this poll is partic­
ularly significant because 85 per 
cent of the Black vote in last fall’s 
Presidential Election went to 
Democratic Candidate Hubert H. 
Humphrey.
However, when 4620 adults 
were asked to approve or disap­
prove of the way Nixon is hand­
ling the Vietnam War the results 
were the following:
Approve........................40 r 54 rr
Disapprove.....................36'c 27rr

The sixteenth of September was 
a happy day in Washington. D.C. 
The sun was shining, the presi­
dent was announcing the withdra­
wal of another 35.000 troops from 
Vietnam, and the moon men were 
appearing before a jovial joint

lations Commission, because the 
State Legislature also passed a 
bill (HB 567) in July. 1969. which 
adds sex' to the list of categories 
on which it is unlawful to discrim­
inate in employment, housing and 
public accommodations"
Asked if the I V lance had any 
teeth in it. Prt sident Heide re­
plied. "Section 15 specifies that 
any person who shall violate the 
Ordinance shall be subject to a 
fine of not more than $300 or 90 
days imprisonment. If the three 
defendants were punished for each 
violation, the total penalty would

session of Congress. It appeared 
to newsmen as if the government 
were trying for one super-happy 
front page.
Actually Nixon was hard pres­
sed to make the announcement 
of his more modest troop with­
drawal after South Vietnamese 
Vice President Nguyen Cao Kv 
had said a day earlier that an­
other 40.500 troops would be with­
drawn bv November.
The National Student Associat­
ion assumed that Nixon would 
wait until October to announce 
further troop withdrawals in order 
to coincide with the beginning of 
the Vietnam Moratorium, a cam­
paign of monthly class and work 
boycotts protesting the war and 
culminating in a national march 
on Washington in mid-November. 
Apparently the government was 
more concerned with plans by 
SDS and other radical students 
for anti-war action surrounding 
the October trials of the Chicago 
Eight stemming from last year's 
Democratic National Convention 
Now the president will be expect­
ed to withdraw more troops by 
mid-October if he is to placate

ents. a NSA spokesman said. But 
even with the withdrawal already 
announced there are still more

In these critical times, it is 
important for me to review the 
policies and practices of the 
University of Pittsburgh 
regarding employment oppor­
tunities in our construction 
programs.
First, it should be obvious but it 
is worth re-emphasizing that the 
University is committed to 
combating racial discrimination 
in all sectors of its employment, 
and, in particular, in respect to the 
construction trades where
discrimination throughout the
United States has been especially 
pronounced. It should also be
ovious that large numbers of the 
faculty, staff and students of the 
University—and I am one of 
them—are in sympathy with the 
objective of expanding job
opportunities for blacks in the
construction trades, as currently 
being negotiated in Pittsburgh.
I believe that not only the 
social progress but the economic 
progress of Pittsburgh depend 
heavily upon the outcome of these 
negotiations. I have kept in close 
touch with civic, community, and 
industrial leaders, and I feel that 
most of them very much want the 
current negotiations to result in 
agreement, as I do. It is for this 
reason that neigher I, as an 
individual, nor the University as 
an institution should attempt to 
mix into the negotiations, to 
appear to bring pressure on either 
party, or to engage in any act out 
of sympathy for social justice that 
could endanger the public safety 
or could otherwise jeopardize the 
changes of agreement.
Nonetheless, the Uittsburgh is 
determined to do everything 
possible to eliminate racial 
discrimination in all sectors of its

DO YOU WANT AN OPEN PSYCHOLOGY DEPARTMENT?
A group of interested students are forming on campus with 
the goal of resolving the problem created by the closing of 
the Psychology Department. This group needs information 
from students who wish to transfer into the department. If 
you are considering electing psychology as your major re­
gardless of your year, complete this form and deposit it at

own operations, including 
employment.
In dune, 1968, I directed all 
Deans and Directors not only to 
seek applicants for employment 
from racial minorities, but to take 
action to give priority in the 
selection process to qualiffied 
black applicants in those areas in 
which there is relatively low 
minority group representation.
In all contracts for 
construction under University 
control, we endeavor to require 
that contractors comply with state 
and federal anti-discrimination 
laws, and that they make positive 
efforts to employ as many 
minoritygroup construction 
workers as possible. At our 
regualr meetings with con­
tractors, we have emphasized the 
need for compliance with these 
provisions, with some success.
In addition, I have directed that 
the following policies and actions 
be taken :
1. The University will support 
any satisfactory agreement 
reached in the current 
negotiations.
2. If such a-reement is not 
reached, the University shall 
defer initiation of any new 
construction project under its 
control and shall request that the 
General State Authority not 
initiate projects on behalf of the 
University until we feel that 
Satisfactory progress has been 
made in correcting unjust 
employment practices.
3. Federal authorities are being 
asked to investigate whether 
unlawful discriminatory practices 
exist on the Central Blood Bank 
construction project, which is 
under University control. If 
unlawful discrimination is found 
and cannot be eliminated by 
conciliation, appropriate 
sanctions, such as contract 
termination and court action un­
der the Civil Rights Act of 1964, 
can be imposed by federal 
authorities.
4. The General State Authority 
is being requested to take action to 
correct any discriminatory 
practices that may exist on the 
Benedum Hall construction 
project in violation of state or 
federal law. This facility, which 
will house the School of 
Engineering, is being constructed 
as a Commonwealth project and is 
not within the University’s 
control.
5. Craft unions engaged in 
internal University maintenance 
projects have been requested that, 
as job vacancies occur, black 
candidates be recruited and hired 
on a priority basis until an 
equitable number of black 
workers are employed.
6. The University will 
investiage the feasibility of 
conducting our own recruiting and 
training programs to increase the 
opportunities for black workers to 
find employment as skilled 
workers in the construction trades 
at the University.
7. The University endoreses the
proposed concept of
Commonwealth supervision of 
craft union hiring standards and 
practices.
8. The University will 
investiage with federal and state 
agencies opportunities for 
applying the technical resources 
of the University in research and 
development projects for improv­
ing training methods and concepts 
in the skilled crafts, applicable not 
only regionally but nationally.

"Gap" Evident 
On Sex Issue
The “generation gap” is dram­
atically seen in the views of Am­
ericans on premarital sex. A large 
majority of persons over 30 say 
premarital sex relations are 
“wrdng,” but adults in their 20’s 
are fairly closely divided in their 
opinions. These findings were re­
corded in a nationwide Gallop sur­
vey conducted with 1517 persons 
over the age of 21.
The significance of age as a 
factor in views on premarital sex 
is also seen in a Gallop survey of 
college students conducted last 
May. In that report, students by 
a 2-to-l margin approved of pre­
marital sex.

Coalition
(Continued from Page 1)
local papers explaining why the 
white community was support­
ing the BCC’s demands, Robin­
son replied that the BCC did 
not want to get involved in a 
public relations debate.
In reply to a question about 
whether or not the FBCC will 
support the Coalition if it moves 
into other social areas the opin­
ion of the group seemed to be 
that the Coalition itself was key­
ed to the construction issuer “The 
strength and virtue of the FBCC 
is that it is a terminating group, 
keyed to a single issue,” Rob­
inson commented.
Others voiced worries that the 
FBCC will become stronger, than 
the BCC. “The structure of the 
FBCC does not determine its 
strength,” was the reply. “The 
BCC has a stronger continuency 
in the black community than the 
whites have in theirs.”
It was suggested that the FBCC 
get involved in trying to defeat 
Nixon’s cutback on federal hous­
ing. “We should also be helping 
unemployed whites seeking jobs. 
Nobody has a right until every­
body has a right,” one woman 
said.
The discussion turned to what 
kinds of actins, if the negotiat­
ions do not produce satisfactory 
results, the FBCC should pur­
sue.
“The fight will only be won 
when the unions are hurting 
because their jobs are being clos­
ed down. We need people picket­
ing day after day. We need mon­
ey, public understanding, and may­
be we even need some beaten 
heads.”
Byrd Brown and Nate Smith, 
two Coalition leaders, entered 
the meeting to report on where 
negotiations were at the time and 
what the current thinking of 
the BCC was.
Brown explained that the un­
ions are caucusing 75 per cent 
of the time. “They go in for four 
hours and then come out and say 
to us ‘What do you mean by this. 
What do you say.’”
“We^sang it to them. We told 
them the same thing over and 
over again,” Smith said bitterly.
“We believe in law and or­
der. These people are breaking 
the law. We told the government 
mediator to report to his boss 
that he should weield the stick 
of the federal government over 
the unions.”
A white member asked Brown
what the Coalition’s plans were 
for future demonstrations.
“We can’t see the purpose of 
any more peaceful, non - vio­
lent demonstrations. We tried 
the system but it did not work. 
We should have asked the de­
partment stores for jobs while we 
were boycotting,” he answered. 
“We may have to do things that 
involve violence. Picket lines 
are not going to close the cities.”
It was mentioned that the Pitts­
burgh Police have been mobilized 
and the National Guard is on alert 
and can be in the area within 
30 minutes.
Brown then asked the represen­
tatives, “What' can you do and 
when?” He asked for a report by 
Friday afternoon.
“We’re tired of walking down­
town,” he continued. “The march 
the second day was supposed to 
be diversionary. Other people 
were supposed to leave by bus­
es to close construction sites. But 
our plans got fouledup,” Brown 
added.
Brown further stated that it 
was impossible to divulge the 
Coalition’s strategy because “the 
element of surprise is so very 
important.”
He did not reveal whether the 
Coaltion was thinking of closing 
sites. “We have to remember 
that for every 100 arrested, it 
costs us $3600 in bail money.”
Both Brown and Smith were 
sufficiently angry to comment, 
“We are not going to have any 
more peaceful demonstrations. 
We have some brothers who, if 
pushed, all hell’s going to break 
loose.”
But, it seemed to us because 
the Coalition itself was divided 
at the moment, it was impossible 
to judge what form future demon­
strations were going to take. And, 
of course, their actions also de­
pend upon what happens when 
negotiations resume Tuesday.
A closed Coalition meeting 
Friday night was supposed to es­
timate the strength of the Coali­
tion. “Peaceful demonstrations 
destroy our credibility in the 
community because nothing hap­
pens,” Brown stated. “It is not 
true that while negotiations con­
tinue we’ll hold off all demonstra­
tions.”
One member of the FBCC 
suggested the “almighty dollar” 
as the Coalition’s greatest weapon. 
“An economic boycott would 
stop the flow of money in the 
City,” But it was the opinion of 
the Committee that stores were not 
the target of the dispute and that
the tactic “was not direct en­
ough.”
Brown stated before he left the 
guidelines of the negotiations. 
They stipulate »that each party 
has the right to caucus as long 
as they want and that they all 
have the power to bargain and 
reach an agreement. He added 
that the unions also have 15 to 
30 days to take any agreement to 
their memberships for ratification, 
if necessary.
“I am not upset by the length 
of time they caucus, but by how 
many recesses they are taking.”
He urged the federal govern­
ment to use .power to enforce law 
and order “just as Nixon wants.”
Before the meeting adjourned, 
an emergency steering com­
mittee of the FBCC was called 
for Friday morning to disucss 
what kinds of actions whites 
could initiate.
At the meeting Friday it was 
decided that rallys, demonstrations 
and construction shut-downs on 
college campuses will proceed 
providing the University does not 
get word from the BCC that the 
action will be detrimental to their 
position.
Negotiations Recess
While negotiations were in re­
cess for five days while trade 
and craft union leaders were in 
Atlantic City conferring with in­
ternational union officials, state­
ments of support and talks contin­
ued in Pittsburgh.
At a news conference Friday 
Afternoon, Mike Dismond an­
nounced that the Coalition has 
called for a summit meeting of 
coalition groups from nine major 
cities to plan strategy. Dismond 
said that telegrams had been sent 
to eight major cities — Chicago, 
New York, Detroit, Cleveland and 
four other cities “that we won’t 
identify until later” — after nego­
tiations with the local trade un­
ions and constructors hit an im­
passe on Thursday.
All the cities, Dismond remark­
ed, are faced with similar dif­
ficulties. Chicago talks reached 
an impasse Wednesday.
Asked about the possibilities 
of further demonstrations, Dis­
mond said, “We have called an 
emergency meeting of the Pitts­
burgh Coalition to plan the neces­
sary actions, and the next steps 
toward reaching these goals of 
black employment in skilled craft 
jobs.”
He did not comment whether 
or not future demonstrations 
would be peaceful.
City groups and officials of­
fered their support over the week­
end for the demands of the Black 
Construction Coalition.
Speaking Saturday at a news 
conference Saturday, Governor 
Raymond Shafer said that some 
building trades unions failed to 
take in as many black workers as 
they should.
He added that he would not 
put up with any violence from 
any group seeking to have its 
own way in Pennsylvania.
Mr. Shafer said he would be 
meeting with President Nixon on 
Monday in an attempt to find out 
how hard Pennsylvania will be 
hit by Nixon’s plan to cut back 
public building programs.
Support also came from Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh’s Chancellor 
Wesley W. Posvar. In a statement 
issued Friday Posvar asked the 
government to investigate possible 
violations in university construc­
tion projects. The university’s 
$200 million building program 
could be halted if discrimina­
tion were proved. (See text of 
statement, page 7.)
The U. S. Department of 
Health Education and Welfare 
reportedly is sending a team from 
Washington to Pittsburgh to 
check on minority participation 
in Pittsburgh..
In other developments the 
Board of Trustees of the First 
Unitarian Church of Pittsburgh 
with a membership exceeding 600 
adopted a resolution supporting 
the Black Coalition.
The Pittsburgh Presbytery, 
made up of ministers and elders 
in the county’s 201 United Pres­
byterian Churches, has come out 
in support of the Coalition’s 
drive.
A group of 250 Negroes, band­
ed together as “Another Side” 
stated that although it sympathiz­
ed with the jobs effort, it believes
the coalition “has been in the 
streets too long.” The director of 
the group said the coalition’s ef­
forts should be concentrated on 
“peaceful negotiations around the 
conference table.”
World Affairs 
Council To 
Sponsor Program
The Duquesne University Un­
ion Forum Committee will pre­
sent a program featuring three 
high ranking State Department 
officials on September 26 at 2:30 
p.m. in the Duquesne Room of 
the Duquesne Union. The event 
is being co-sponsored by the 
World Affairs Council and is 
open to students of all Pittsburgh 
area colleges.
The format followed in the pro­
gram will consist of a thirty 
minute formal presentation by 
each of the guest diplomats, 
each of which will be followed 
by a twenty minute question and 
answer period. Since the of­
ficials are experts in Near East 
affairs, Latin American affairs, 
and State Department economic 
policies, the quizzing periods 
should present many opportuni­
ties for asking questions about con­
troversial matters of foreign 
policy.
The Union Formu Committee 
urges Carnegie-Mellon students 
8to attend and to be prepared to 
ask many poignant questions.
