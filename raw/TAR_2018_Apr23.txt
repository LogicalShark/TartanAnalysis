The hunt for the serial masturbatorsFundraising effort lasts months later

April 20 marks the 
seven-month anniversary 
of the day Hurricane Maria 
hit Puerto Rico. Those fol-
lowing the crisis might 
know about the fundrais-
ing work of junior and deci-
sion science major Rosana 
Guernica and her team, 
which resulted in several 
chartered ?ights to the 
island that brought sup-
plies and evacuated medi-
cal patients who couldn’t 
receive treatment on the 
island because there was 
inadequate power. Though 
they received quite a bit of 
recognition for their initial 
fundraising efforts, they 
have never stopped helping 
the island.
In an interview with 
The Tartan, three members 
of the team — Guernica, 
along with Gabriel 
Ostolaza, a masters stu-
dent in the College of 
Engineering, and Paloma 
Hernandez, a junior in BXA 
— described the current is-
sues facing Puerto Rico and 
the areas they are focusing 
on in their volunteer work, 
which they are formalizing 
into a nonpro?t complete 
with a donated of?ce space.
Guernica’s fundraising 
efforts are still going strong, 
even seven months after 
the storm. This month, 
Pittsburgh Filmmakers 
held a fundraiser event for 
her work, with Pittsburgh 
mayor Bill Peduto and San 
Juan mayor Carmen Yulin 
Cruz, where they screened 
a documentary about the 
team’s work to help the 
island. In total, they raised 
$5,500 for their upcoming 
projects.
When I asked the team 
members to describe the 
island’s situation today, 
they came to a consensus 
that there seemed to be a 
new normal taking hold. 
“People are going back to 
their regular lives as much 
as they can — they’re go-
ing back to school, to 
work,” said Guernica. “But, 
it’s really different from 
how our home usually is, 
like half the traf?c lights 
don’t work...it’s just a new 
normal that everyone’s 
accepted,” she noted.
Ostolaza points out that 
because of this, the media 
spotlight has not been on 
the island as much because 
people seem to be going 
back to their normal lives, 
despite the fact that it is not 
a good normal. Hernandez 
further states that morale 
is still low because of the 
conditions on the island. 
There are still thousands of 
islanders who have had no 
power since Irma or Maria, 
and the electrical grid is 
still quite unstable — the 
day before the interview, 
the entire island went into 
a blackout that lasted for 
about a day.
As Puerto Rico has 
shifted out of emergency 
response mode and into 
recovery mode, so have 
the team’s projects. A more 
recent project was help-
ing people who wanted 
or needed to return to 
the island but couldn’t 
travel commercially. For 
instance, they helped two 
girls who were bedridden 
with microcephaly return 
to the island. The girls were 
forced to leave the main-
land, because their family 
couldn’t afford out-of-
pocket treatment and were 
denied Medicaid and other 
healthcare bene?ts.
Another critical issue 
regarding Puerto Rico is 
the housing issues facing

Driving a green car, an 
older car, and most recent-
ly, a blue car. The identity 
of Carnegie Mellon’s very 
own Scranton Strangler, 
or better yet, Mellon 
Masturbator, remains 
elusive to this day. With 
six distinct incidents 
occurring in the span of 
two years, these instanc-
es of indecent exposure 
have raised numerous 
concerns among the stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon 
University.
With the first of this 
string of events occur-
ring on March 19, 2016, 
and the most recent on 
April 11, 2018, the consis-
tency of these crimes has 
boggled and worried vari-
ous students and parents 
thereof.
“Now six of these 
since 2016, is that a lot? 
It’s significant in that it’s 
got everyone’s attention. 
What actually gets every-
one’s attention, which I’m 
happy about, is the safety 
alerts,” says Chief Thomas 
Ogden of the Carnegie 
Mellon police department.
Ogden assures that 
the Carnegie Mellon 
police department is do-
ing everything in their 
power to apprehend these 
criminals. However, the 
various descriptions given 
to the police indicate 
no similarities or trends 
among the unknown 
number of suspects lead-
ing to further difficulty 
in the investigation. 
Descriptions range from 
a 20 year-old to a six-foot 
bald man. The only simi-
larity amongst the various 
suspects is that they are 
all male.
Another barrier for the 
Carnegie Mellon police is 
their strict adherence to 
their jurisdiction. Work-
ing with the University of 
Pittsburgh and Pittsburgh 
police, the Carnegie 
Mellon police depart-
ment patrols and pro-
tects a very specific area 
within Pittsburgh, namely 
Carnegie Mellon’s cam-
pus. Only the most recent 
reported instance lies 
within Carnegie Mellon’s 
police jurisdiction.
“The only one of these 
six that we have any ju-
risdiction in is the most 
recent one, the other 
ones, we don’t have any 
police powers there,” says 
Chief Ogden. “The crime 
alerts we sent out, some 
of them, are relative to 
things that happened 
way off-campus. They’re 
areas that the students 
frequent, so I just want to 
make sure you know that 
this area and the South 
Side, there was a problem 
and just be careful, you 
know, act accordingly,” he 
continues.
The best and most 
helpful approach to 
anyone who experi-
ences similar crimes is 
immediate action.
“In the moment, the 
best thing to do is call 
immediately,” says Chief 
Ogden. “It’s the delay 
that hurts. In cases like 
this, our average response 
time is exceptional. We’re 
out there all the time on 
campus and around the 
campus so if we get the 
call, there’s a much bet-
ter chance we can do 
something.”
Ogden’s call for 
immediate action after a 
crime derives from the in-
nate reaction people have 
after witnessing or being 
involved with a crime. 
People, including stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon, 
tend to wait after witness-
ing a crime, possibly out 
of shock or fear.
“It’s just a human na-
ture thing, you’re busy, 
you got away from it, you 
think about it, maybe you 
tell a few people and then 
by the time the police get 
told there’s nothing for us 
to do immediately,” says 
Chief Ogden. “That’s com-
mon anywhere, people 
wait.”
Immediate reporting, 
even given a busy 
schedule, is an impera-
tive step towards catch-
ing the many men at 
large  indecently  expos-
ing themselves around 
Carnegie Mellon and 
University of Pittsburgh 
campus. Ogden attributes 
the motives of these men 
to several possibilities in-
cluding mental health or 
impaired judgement.
“I’ve been doing this 
39 years and these people 
have some issue obvious-
ly, whether they need at-
tention, they have mental 
health issues,” Ogden stip-
ulates. “Other instances 
people are intoxicated and 
they just do it. It’s varied, 
everyone’s different.”
The problem at hand 
does not, in any way, rest 
soundly with the Carnegie 
Mellon Police depart-
ment. Their limitations, 
based on jurisdiction and 
the lack of detail and im-
mediacy in reports, has 
made catching these crim-
inals a challenging task. In 
the case that these crimes 
do move closer to campus, 
Ogden and the police de-
partment are prepared to 
take immediate action.
“If we had six [crimes 
occur] on campus, we’d be 
doing a number of things 
like stakeouts, video, 
unmarked cars, but un-
fortunately, these are all 
over the place at different 
times.”

the hurricane’s survivors. 
On the island, residents 
are having trouble getting 
government aid because 
many of them could not 
prove that they owned their 
homes, as a lot of owner-
ship information had never 
been formalized. Guernica 
recalled the story of a fam-
ily in Puerto Rico — the 
family home used to belong 
to the grandmother before 
she passed away. She left 
the house to her daughter 
but never formalized this 
in a written will, which cre-
ated a host of bureaucratic 
problems for the family.
The housing issues 
extend to the island’s 
evacuees on the mainland 
as well. This past Monday, 
22 families currently stay-
ing in Philadelphia were 
noti?ed that their Federal 
Emergency Management 
Agency (FEMA) assistance 
would run out on Friday, 
April 20, and so they would 
be evicted. Returning to 
the island wasn’t an option, 
because their homes have 
not been rebuilt. The fami-
lies couldn’t ?nd jobs in 
Philadelphia, because the 
city has taken in so many 
Puerto Rican evacuees, and 
public housing in Philadel-
phia wasn’t an option either 
as they had decade-long 
waiting lists.
The day of the interview, 
Guernica was anxiously 
contacting various non-
pro?t organizations in 
hopes of relocating them 
to Pittsburgh, away from 
the housing crisis in 
Philadelphia. Fortunately, 
as CBS News correspondent 
David Begnaud reported, 
FEMA decided at the last 
minute to extend tempo-
rary shelter assistance 
to May 14, giving these 
families some breathing 
room.
The team also has 
two longer-term projects 
planned, both of which 
are focused on addressing 
problems that plagued the 
island after the hurricane. 
One of the projects was 
motivated by the severe 
communication outage 
Puerto Rico faced in the 
initial days after the hur-
ricane. “People could not 
communicate with each 
other; the government 
couldn’t communicate with 
anybody...we actually lost 
a lot of lives [due to this 
lack of communication] be-
cause people were throw-
ing themselves into the 
street to ?nd their families 
and they were getting in the 
way of the ?rst responders,” 
Ostolaza explained.
Chaos reigned; although 
a curfew was put into place, 
in practice, many people 
didn’t obey it because un-
derstandably, they were so 
anxious to ?nd their miss-
ing loved ones. Thus, a 
conception Guernica’s team 
has for their next project is 
to use drones to implement 
an emergency communica-
tion system that will con-
nect the major cities togeth-
er even when the primary 
power and communications 
grids are down. In the pri-
vate meeting the team had 
with Mayor Cruz when she 
visited Carnegie Mellon, 
Cruz seemed especially 
excited about this commu-
nication system, according 
to Guernica.
The other project 
focuses on addressing in-
dividual emergency pre-
paredness. “A lot of people. 
..just didn’t have the infor-
mation necessary to pre-
pare well,” Guernica said. 
Thus, they aim to distrib-
ute waterproof emergency 
preparation boxes. They 
will contain instructions on 
what type of food to buy, 
and can be used to store 
important documents and 
credit cards, as well as sup-
plies such as matches that 
one wouldn’t want to get 
wet.
The effects of the 
hurricane in Puerto Rico 
is an evolving story, and it 
is far from being back to 
normal.
“We still need help, and 
there’s a lot more Ameri-
cans can do,” Ostolaza 
said. Besides donating to 
causes that support the 
island, Americans can 
“educate themselves on 
what’s happening,” he said, 
which can happen with 
something as simple as a 
Google search, and could 
lead to ?guring out poten-
tial ways to help. Guernica 
hopes that people realize 
that anyone can do what 
they are doing with enough 
willpower — the team pri-
marily consists of students 
who are in their late teens 
or early twenties who are 
simultaneously functioning 
as students.
Although many call 
these students angels and 
heroes for their work, the 
sadness at the past and wor-
ry for the future runs strong 
among the team members. 
“It’s fun and it’s great to 
be recognized, but...you 
never think about being 
recognized,” Ostolaza said. 
“It’s not like we crossed the 
?nish line, and we’re cel-
ebrating,” added Guernica. 
“We are worried sick [and] 
depressed. After we ?n-
ished our trips, it really 
sunk in with a lot of us. And, 
since we were no longer in 
emergency response mode, 
we started to mourn what 
happened to our island...
On our last trip, three peo-
ple almost died,” she said, 
with audible emotion. “It 
feels like it’s just a grain of 
sand,” Hernandez stated.
For the team, the nature 
of the people on the island 
is a silver lining. They 
described the people as 
resilient and determined 
to rebuild. People helped 
each other even when they 
had little for themselves. 
Hernandez recalled that 
when she was on the island, 
locals would ask her if she 
needed anything; she was 
shocked at this as the locals 
still had so many unmet 
needs. When the team was 
on the island, Ostolaza’s 
mom would cook for all 
ten team members — even 
though she only had a sin-
gle working stovetop, she 
still managed to cook up 
rice, beans, plantains, and 
chicken. “The Puerto Rican 
spirit gives me hope,” said 
Guernica.

Enigma machine promotes focus on computational history 
NORA MATTSON
News Editor
Though perhaps not as well 
attended as the Wale concert 
or the Holi celebration, “From 
Enigma to AI: The Legacy of 
Pamela McCorduck and Joseph 
Traub at CMU,” was similarly an 
event this Carnival weekend that 
was ?ocked to by the public.
The panel discussing the 
donations of Pamela McCorduck 
to the University Libraries Special 
Collection and the legacy of for-
mer School of Computer Science 
head Joseph Traub may have 
deviated from the theme of myths 
and legends, but accomplished the 
mission of other Carnival events as 
it brought people from all parts of 
the university together to discuss 
historical computing.
McCorduck, an author who 
writes about arti?cial intelligence 
and women in technology, was 
married to the former head of the 
computer science department, the 
late Traub. Her contributions from 
the McCorduck-Traub collection 
to the library include many his-
torical computation devices, from 
the ?rst mechanical calculator 
that was commercially produced 
to rare books by Charles Babbage, 
the inventor of the analytical en-
gine considered to be the ?rst 
mechanical computing device.
A highlight of this donation, 
spotlighted by the title of the 
panel, was two Enigma machines. 
Enigma machines were used by 
Germany during World War II 
to encrypt wartime communica-
tion and were the focus of many 
decryption efforts by the British 
during the war.
“For one of the best schools of 
computer science in the world, 
a collection of ancestral ma-
chines seems a good marker of 
where the field has come from,” 
McCorduck said of her donation 
in a university press release.
The panel consisted of 
McCorduck, Andrew Moore, the 
Dean of the School of Computer 
Science, Julia Parsons, a Carnegie 
Institute of Technology graduate 
who worked as a codebreaker 
during World War II, Mary Shaw, 
a School of Computer Science 
professor, and Keith Webster, the 
Dean of the University Libraries. 
Parsons, when working as part 
of an all-women codebreak-
ing team, was present when 
the transmission that led to the 
decryption of the German code 
was intercepted, and her contri-
butions were honored during the 
panel.
Moore highlighted the 
importance of the history of 
computing to the current study 
of the discipline, stating in the 
Pittsburgh Tribune Review that 
he encourages all first-year 
computer science students to 
view the collection in order to 
show them that they can not 
just work at a big tech company 
but make something with a real 
impact on the world, adding that 
when one looks at the legacy of 
the machine, “We see people 
who took technology to save lives 
and save the world.” The Enigma 
machine, like much of the work 
coming out of the Software 
Engineering Institute today at 
Carnegie Mellon, had a military 
application.
The hope of the expansion 
of this collection is to expand 
the academic exploration of the 
computers of the 19th and the 
20th century at Carnegie Mellon. 
It was announced at the panel 
by Webster that the libraries will 
be hiring a researcher to further 
examine their collection.
The Enigma machines that 
Carnegie Mellon have are some of 
the only ones of the 350 surviving 
devices that are on display to the 
public. The collection is located 
in the Rare and Fine Book room 
in Hunt Library, which will be 
open weekdays from 4 to 6 p.m. 
through the beginning of May.

Kendrick Lamar’s win breaks Pulitzer Prize’s tradition
Every year, the Pulitzer Prize 
awards notable achievements in 
newspaper, online journalism, lit-
erature, and musical composition in 
the United States. The Pulitzer Prize 
for Fiction is arguably the most well 
known, and hundreds of books com-
pete for the coveted golden stamp.
Yet this year, a lesser-known 
category has taken the spotlight: the 
Pulitzer Prize for Music. The prize 
was awarded to the album DAMN. 
by Kendrick Lamar, marking the ?rst 
time a music Pulitzer was given to 
any work that wasn’t classical or jazz.
Public reaction was mixed. Pre-
dictably, some reacted with deri-
sion. Various music critics turned up 
their noses at the genre and wrote 
scathing reviews. One critic from 
The Washington Post declared, “you 
can’t spell crap without rap.” While 
there is not enough space to list them 
all, there are surely other mocking 
reviews hidden in the snobby, an-
tagonistic, and occasionally racist 
recesses of the internet.
Others criticized the choice to 
award such a commercially success-
ful piece. They acknowledge the al-
bum’s quality but question its fame, 
wary about giving the Pulitzer Prize 
to popular pieces of music. Zachary 
Woolfe, the classical music editor of 
The New York Times, detailed the 
heart of this anxiety, stating that the 
Pulitzer Prize “is now of?cially one 
fewer guaranteed platform…for 
noncommercial work, which scrapes 
by on grants, fellowships, commis-
sions, and yes, awards.”
To be fair, the difference in popu-
larity is notable. Lamar’s DAMN. 
reached No. 1 on the pop chart and 
generated over two million dollars 
in revenue. The other ?nalists for the 
Pulitzer Prize were Michael Gilbert-
son, who wrote a string quartet, and 
Ted Hearne, who wrote a ?ve-move-
ment cantata. These pieces, while 
popular in their own right, de?nitely 
never made it onto the pop charts or 
into mainstream music consciousness 
and thus did not gain the same kind of 
?nancial success for the creator.
However, even though the anxi-
ety is understandable, it is irrelevant 
to the goal of the Prize. Pulitzer 
Prizes should not yield to popularity, 
but they also shouldn’t avoid it alto-
gether. Sometimes the most deserv-
ing piece will also make the most 
money, and sometimes the second 
best piece will make no money at 
all; that’s life. If awards were granted 
based on how much the recipients 
needed the money, then they would 
lose meaning altogether.
Fortunately, for every snobbish 
or anxious reaction there were ten 
positive ones. In an interview with 
The Washington Post, composer Alex 
Temple said, “A lot of people are 
very enthusiastic about Kendrick’s 
win, saying that it’s about time the 
Pulitzer moved beyond its limited fo-
cus on contemporary classical music 
and, for the most part, on work by 
white men.”
The Atlantic agreed, stating, “The 
ability to hear hip-hop as brilliant 
music, period, is overdue for insti-
tutions and observers of all kind.” 
Similarly, Jon Pareles, the chief pop 
music critic for The New York Times, 
said, “if you ask me, it should have 
happened sooner.” Other publica-
tions have also chimed in with com-
parable sentiments, thrilled that the 
Pulitzers are opening up new doors 
and starting to appreciate all genres 
of music equally.
Regardless of which position you 
take, it’s safe to say that the 2018 
Pulitzer Prize for Music has prompted 
public dialogue. But it’s important to 
note that dialogue seems to center on 
the Pulitzers rather than the album. 
The story is not that Lamar won a 
Pulitzer Prize, but that the Pulitzers 
gave a prize to Lamar.
This is because the prize ulti-
mately says more about the Pulitzers 
than Kendrick Lamar. Most critics 
recognized that the album was mas-
terful; what surprised them was that 
the Pulitzers broke their unspoken 
rules in order to recognize that mas-
tery. “The rapper’s win is probably 
more signi?cant to the reputation of 
the prize itself than to the prize win-
ner,” stated The Atlantic. “It almost 
feels as though the Pulitzers won a 
Kendrick Lamar, and not the other 
way around.”
Indeed, the Pulitzers do seem to 
get the better end of the deal. Lamar 
gets recognition and accolades, but 
he was already famous, and the cash 
prize pales in comparison to the 
pro?t generated by the album. The 
Pulitzers, on the other hand, have 
been lauded as progressive. Their 
music prize is in the news for the ?rst 
time in years. They refurbished their 
image over the course of a single vot-
ing session, transforming from anti-
quated institution to open-minded 
music authority.
But, how progressive are they re-
ally? They broke tradition to award 
Lamar, but why not award any of 
the other intelligent, layered, and 
dynamic hip-hop albums? It’s pos-
sible that timing is a factor. Popular 
conceptions of “acceptable” mu-
sic genres are changing, and the 
Pulitzers may have felt pressured to 
move away from classical music be-
fore they were written off entirely. 
(This could also explain why they 
awarded DAMN. and not Lamar’s 
earlier and equally masterful album, 
To Pimp a Butter?y.)
Furthermore, the Pulitzers did 
not even consider Lamar’s album 
in the beginning. According to The 
Atlantic, “Lamar’s work entered the 
discussion once [the judging panel] 
realized that some of the modern 
classical artists they were evaluating 
bore clear hip-hop in?uence.” They 
consequently decided to go back 
to the source of that in?uence, and 
Lamar seemed the best place to start.
So the timing had to be right, 
and the judges had to recognize hip-
hop’s in?uence in other music before 
considering it on its own merits. It’s 
possible — likely, even — that other 
external factors crept into the sup-
posedly impartial judging room. 
These factors lined up to catapult 
DAMN. to victory, but does that make 
the Pulitzers deserving of praise?
Overall, Lamar’s DAMN. receiving 
the Pulitzer Prize for Music is a good 
thing. It’s just not necessarily a great 
thing. The Pulitzers can still do much 
more to acknowledge and award all 
types of music and other forms of 
creation. With any luck, the judges 
will realize that they should follow in 
the footsteps of their Prize recipient 
and be bold, be authentic, and be a 
pioneer all the time, not just when it 
suits them.

Ever since Donald Trump an-
nounced he was running for presi-
dent, he remained skeptical of the 
status quo of trade. His “America 
?rst” vision involved pulling out of 
the Trans-Paci?c Partnership (TPP) 
and hefty negotiations with the 
North American Free Trade Agree-
ment (NAFTA). He pledged to de-
clare China a currency manipula-
tor. Trump claimed that ultimately, 
he can bring back jobs to America. 
However, the people who Trump ap-
pealed to and promised to help are 
now becoming fearful for a trade war 
that will ultimately hurt them.
Earlier this month, Trump 
threatened to burden Chinese goods 
with a hefty $100 billion tariff. Con-
sequently, U.S. Treasury Secretary 
Steven Mnuchin, on CNBC, recog-
nized the “potential of a trade war,” 
which led to Dow Jones plummet-
ing. The Chinese government re-
sponded to the threat of a tariff by 
saying that it would “?ght at any 
cost.” This included a proposed re-
taliatory tariff on soybeans, corn, 
and other row crops, biting at the 
farmers here in the U.S.
Even those who believe that the 
U.S. is being taken advantage of by un-
fair trade policies and demand change 
are wary of the potential trade war. 
Farmers, especially, are beginning to 
fear a trade war and what that would 
mean for them. Already, the threat of 
a trade war was enough for the price 
of soybeans to plummet. If tensions 
were to escalate to a trade war, Ameri-
cans should anticipate higher price 
tags on imported goods. Conversely, 
struggling farms would be slashing 
prices to try to make ends meet, if they 
can even stay in business at all.
As bleak as some farmers’ futures 
may be, not all have lost faith in 
Trump or are completely disen-
chanted. Some perceive the threat 
of a tariff to be a gateway for negotia-
tions. A threat would catch attention; 
striking a deal would come after. 
Some others do believe that he acted 
harshly, but regardless of the possible 
motives, there is a theme that ties all 
the speculations: hope that Trump 
would be a man for the working class. 
After being left unsatis?ed during 
the Obama administration, farmers 
wanted someone who would bring 
something different and who would 
change the status quo. Clinton would 
deliver no change; Trump, on the 
other hand, would.
Unfortunately, the change that 
was anticipated was not the fear of a 
trade war.
Yes, the U.S. has a trade de?cit 
of approximately $375 billion. How-
ever, slapping on tariffs is not the 
way to go. This resonates with the 
1930 Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act dur-
ing Herbert Hoover’s term. The Great 
Depression made isolationism ap-
pealing, and the act appeared to be a 
potential solution to pull the U.S. out 
of the depression and protect U.S. 
farmers against agricultural imports. 
However, this tariff led to the over-
production of agricultural goods, 
causing farmers to drop their prices. 
Farmers cannot inde?nitely drop 
prices; once they pass the break-even 
point, selling their crops would cause 
them to lose pro?t, not gain pro?t, 
leading them to go out of business. 
More than a thousand economists 
urged Hoover to veto the bill, but the 
bill was signed and the depression 
was further exacerbated.
Just as it was in the 1930s, there 
is not much room for optimism in 
Trump’s threat to burden China with 
tariffs. If the mere threat of a tariff 
was enough to trigger a change in 
prices in soybeans, it is hard to imag-
ine the reach of actual tariffs imple-
mented. Additionally, this would 
create further tensions with China, 
something the U.S. cannot afford to 
do.
There is a signi?cant reason 
Trump is reluctant to explicitly 
label China a currency manipula-
tor despite the fact he promised 
to do so on the campaign trail. In 
2017, Trump tweeted, “Why would 
I call China a currency manipula-
tor when they are working with us 
on the North Korean problem?” If 
the U.S. has strained relations with 
China, Trump would have a harder 
time pressuring North Korea to 
de-nuclearize. Given the potential 
stakes and unpredictable behaviors 
of North Korea, Trump cannot ruth-
lessly provoke China for possible 
personal gain.
Of course, no single person or 
political ?gure can singlehandedly 
start a trade war, and President 
Trump is no exception. However, 
trade is essential to the U.S. econ-
omy and President Trump does 
have power and in?uence. If he 
truly wants to put “America ?rst,” 
perhaps he should reconsider pro-
voking a major trade partner and 
instead create policies that would 
actually bene?t the working class 
and those he promised to help.

We need to have more open conversations about religion at CMU
IZZY SIO
Pillbox Editor
Ask yourself, are you proud 
of your race?
I am. I am a proud Asian-
American. Specifically, I am a 
proud Chinese-Filipino. I am 
proud of my rich heritage and 
want to speak of it and learn 
more about it. I freaked out over 
the teaser trailer for the movie 
adaptation of Crazy Rich Asians 
last Friday. Even amidst every-
thing going on in the United 
States and its administration, I 
am a proud American.
Now, ask yourself, are you 
proud of your religion?
I’ve been a member of the 
Catholic church since being bap-
tized as an infant. I’ve gone to 
Church every Sunday with my 
parents in one of my home-
town’s various local churches. 
I’ve been an altar server, at-
tended Confraternity of Chris-
tian Doctrine classes as a child, 
and participated as a Eu-
charistic Minister at my 
Catholic high school. 
At Carnegie Mellon, I 
still regularly attend 
mass at St. Paul’s 
Cathedral or the 
Pittsburgh Oratory 
every Sunday.
But, despite all 
of this, my racial 
pride still over-
takes my religious 
pride.
When I first came 
to college, I wanted 
to be more in touch 
with my faith. One of 
my older, more devout 
friends joined the Newman 
Club at the University of 
Pennsylvania so I strived to 
find an extension of that at 
Carnegie Mellon. I was a lit-
tle surprised to find that we 
share a Newman club with 
the University of Pittsburgh. 
While I enjoyed the Newman 
Club talking about broader top-
ics about the Christian faith and 
challenging me to examine my 
faith in general, I wasn’t a fan 
of their timeslot for the nightly 
meetings and had formed stron-
ger connections with people 
from different on-campus orga-
nizations.
But, I guess I should first ask, 
do you even have a religion?
When you go on The Bridge 
and search for organizations 
about “faith,” you pull up 15 
organizations, such as the Inter-
faith Spirituality Embassy and 
the Tartan Athletic Fellowship. 
If you type in “religion,” you pull 
up six overlapping clubs. Com-
pared to the 403 organizations 
listed on The Bridge, those are 
incredibly small numbers.
I don’t want to admit it, but 
one of the bigger, unfortunate 
reasons that I also phased out 
of the Newman Club was that 
none of the friends I hung out 
with most of the time were very 
religious. When I’d mention 
my faith to them, they’d joke 
around saying, “God, I haven’t 
been to Church in a long time,” 
just nodding and accepting this 
big part of my life. There was 
really no further discussion to 
be had, since they didn’t really 
have a strong stance on 
it. Or, they were atheists.
It’s a lot easier to talk about 
race in America than religion 
in America. It is because race is 
so easily identifiable and physi-
cal, while religion is much more 
personal and intimate. Addi-
tionally, certain religions have 
stronger associations with dif-
ferent races and political par-
ties. Speaking from what I know, 
Filipinos are known to be strong, 
devout Catholics with religion 
heavily tied into a large por-
tion of their daily life and the 
country’s culture. This also ap-
plies to the Irish and Hispanics. 
The most popular of these as-
sociations are white Christians, 
whether they 
be Catholic, Protestant, or — the 
most radical and loud of them 
all — Evangelical Protestant.
In an article published on 
FiveThirtyEight, 38 percent of 
young adults are not affiliated 
with any sort of religion. While 
the article mainly focuses on the 
decline of white Evangelicals 
(and quite honestly also could 
mean that the participants in 
the study were mostly white), it 
is that 38 percent of religiously 
unaffiliated individuals that 
is striking because of its sharp 
difference compared to other 
age groups. It considered the 
thought that religion and faith 
systems are dying out.
While I’ve formed incredibly 
strong connections and friend-
ships with religiously unaffili-
ated students here at Carnegie 
Mellon, there is something spe-
cial about the bond you have 
with someone who also shares 
a faith — either the same one 
I have or a religion that’s com-
pletely different. There’s that 
belief in something higher and 
greater. We’d be better equipped 
to have a larger conversation 
about religion. But we don’t.
I want to clarify that the 
last thing I want to do is 
criticize someone for 
not having a faith. In 
fact, I’d enjoy know-
ing more and learn-
ing from them so I 
can challenge my 
own faith to make it 
stronger. Although, 
conversations about 
religion might be chal-
lenging, they are the most 
rewarding and introspective. 
Maybe it’s because we’re trying 
to avoid creating more stigmas 
that relate religion with a spe-
cific race, but in doing so, we’re 
sacrificing the chance to have a 
more open conversation to pos-
sibly break down those stigmas 
for good.

On May 29, Starbucks will close 
8,000 of its stores for “racial bias 
training.” Yes, it’s 2018 and, yes, 
this is an actual headline that has 
graced the covers of various news 
outlets over the past week.
The incident that sparked this 
action occurred in a Philadelphia 
Starbucks restaurant where two 
black men sat at a table without 
purchasing anything. While the 
two men, who were real estate 
agents, were waiting for a third 
party to arrive for a business meet-
ing, they were approached by po-
lice of?cers who arrested them and 
escorted them off the premises. 
The store’s manager, feeling un-
comfortable, had called 911 and 
reported that there were “two gen-
tlemen in the café that are refusing 
to make a purchase or leave.” The 
crime? “Trespassing and creating a 
disturbance.”
In an interview with Good 
Morning America, Rashon Nelson 
and Donte Robinson, recount-
ed that the manager never ap-
proached them about her concerns 
before the police arrived. Jamie Ri-
ley, a Starbucks spokesperson, told 
The Washington Post that the store’s 
of?cial policy was that non-paying 
customers must ?rst be asked to 
leave the store before police inter-
vention would be necessary.
“In this situation,” Riley said, 
“the police should never have been 
called. And we know we have to re-
view the practices and guidelines to 
help ensure it never happens again.”
Not too long after the incident 
made headlines, another video 
surfaced where a black man who 
was denied access to the Starbucks 
restroom for not making a purchase, 
approached a white customer as he 
was leaving the restroom who, de-
spite not having made a purchase 
himself, was granted access.
“What did I do? I just tried to 
use the bathroom like you did,” he 
said to the man. “Is it my skin col-
or?” he repeatedly asked.
Though these stories shocked 
many, even prompting the hashtag 
#boycottstarbucks on Twitter, 
many black Americans, including 
myself, saw it as another case of ra-
cial bias coming to light in 21st cen-
tury America. Implicit bias in itself 
is a natural psychological function 
that allows humans to react faster 
in making connections. However 
natural, when connected to divi-
sions between humans such as gen-
der, sexual orientation, or race, it is 
a clear problem, one whose reach-
es and its pervasiveness to this day 
still continues to be shocking.
Implicit bias towards African-
Americans is a historical issue. On 
the 50th anniversary of Martin 
Luther King’s death, it’s unset-
tling to see just how much prog-
ress this country has yet to make. 
For example, in 1960, four black 
students famously sat down at the 
F. W. Woolworth’s lunch counter. 
The difference in their case was 
that there was no hidden bias, they 
knew exactly what reactions they 
would have to face. “We don’t serve 
Negroes here,” they were told. 
Though they were well-dressed 
and polite to their waiter, they 
were still denied service and taunt-
ed by customers who called them 
derogatory names and poured 
drinks on their heads. Fittingly, 
images of this incident have resur-
faced in response to the Starbucks 
ordeal that Nelson and Robinson 
encountered. Though they were 
well-dressed and by all accounts 
not disruptive, they were treated 
uncivilly, a response that would’ve 
been undoubtedly different were 
it not for the color of their skin and 
the implicit bias attached to it.
“The Starbucks situation pro-
vides dangerous insight regarding 
the failure of our nation to take im-
plicit bias seriously,” said National 
Association for the Advancement 
of Colored People (NAACP) presi-
dent and CEO Derrick Johnson in 
a statement. “We refuse to believe 
that our unconscious bias — the 
racism we are often unaware of — 
can and does make its way into our 
actions and policies.”
In response to the incident, 
Kevin Johnson, the CEO of Star-
bucks, stated, “I’ve spent the last 
few days in Philadelphia with my 
leadership team listening to the 
community, learning what we did 
wrong and the steps we need to 
take to ?x it. While this is not lim-
ited to Starbucks, we’re commit-
ted to being a part of the solution. 
Closing our stores for racial bias 
training is just one step in a journey 
that requires dedication from every 
level of our company and partner-
ships in our local communities.”
While I commend Starbucks for 
taking the initiative to tackle this is-
sue (but let’s be real, anything less 
would’ve been scrutinized by the 
media), I ?nd it unsettling that this 
is a policy that its employees didn’t 
feel like they had to abide by be-
fore: treating people with respect.
Though it has not been dis-
closed how the training will be con-
ducted, it has been revealed that it 
will “address implicit bias, promote 
conscious inclusion, prevent dis-
crimination and ensure everyone 
inside a Starbucks store feels safe 
and welcome.”
Will it work? Comparing the 
1960 sit in to today doesn’t leave 
me hopeful, bias always seems to 
be lurking.
TARTAN RESPONSE: THE TARTAN IS NOT PROPAGANDA
Last week, a letter to the 
editor was published that char-
acterized one of our articles as 
propaganda and irresponsible 
reporting. I would like to re-
spond on behalf of my writers 
who work incredibly hard for 
this paper to these frankly lu-
dicrous claims, since, as news 
editor, I am responsible for the 
tone of our news section and 
not the individual writers who 
were cited.
I would like to say first that 
I disagree with Dury-Agri’s cri-
tique of the Gingrich article, 
as I felt that the writers made 
it clear they were referring to 
the specific projects Gingrich 
cited in his article, includ-
ing minimally invasive heart 
surgery and remote medical 
analysis, and not the research 
done at Carnegie Mellon as a 
whole. This is not to say that 
even those projects do not have 
potential downsides, but that 
I thought it was not an unrea-
sonable stance to point out that 
equating (a word our copy staff 
debated over but ultimately de-
cided was used correctly in the 
article) those projects to frack-
ing was a false equivalency due 
to the established evidence of 
the harms that can be caused by 
fracking.
It might have been inter-
esting to discuss the poten-
tial downsides of the projects 
Gingrich visited, but ultimately 
the focus of the article was 
Gingrich’s piece for Fox. I take 
full responsibility if the article 
read as if the writers were try-
ing to claim that the research 
coming from Carnegie Mellon 
was somehow flawless, but I 
know that it was not their in-
tention and if that was not com-
municated, that comes from my 
failure as an editor.
While I think Dury-Agri’s 
point about this individual ar-
ticle was unfounded, the larger 
point that he failed to make as 
he was busy picking apart a fine 
sentence in a good article might 
have been a real constructive 
contribution. We at The Tartan 
have a responsibility to turn a 
critical eye on the university on 
behalf of the campus communi-
ty we wish to inform. I want to 
work hard at doing this, to wel-
come readers to point out the 
ways in which we could be serv-
ing the campus community bet-
ter, and to urge those who agree 
with this mission to contribute 
to reporting.

Electronics manufac-
turer Sony is partnering 
with Carnegie Mellon’s 
School of Computer Sci-
ence (SCS) to advance re-
search in the ?elds of arti-
?cial intelligence (AI) and 
robotics. 
According to 
an April 18 
press re-
lease, the 
research 
partnership 
will focus on de-
signing robots speci?cally 
to carry out food service 
industry tasks, like pre-
paring and serving food.
Why food? The ultimate 
goal isn’t to replace chefs 
and servers with robots 
but to push the boundar-
ies of what robotics can 
accomplish.
“Making and serving 
food is an immense chal-
lenge for automation, 
so we’re excited about 
the types of machines 
and software that might 
emerge as we jointly 
explore a variety of ap-
proaches and solutions,” 
said Dean of SCS Andrew 
Moore. 
“Both Sony and 
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity aim high, so we are 
con?dent this research 
will produce technologies 
that impact robotics across 
a broad number of appli-
cations.”
Software and hardware 
that can move around 
kitchens and handle ingre-
dients will be able to navi-
gate other kinds of small, 
busy spaces and work with 
any delicate materials, 
even those with irregular 
shapes. These skills could 
be applicable in other set-
tings, including homes 
and of?ces as well as 
manufacturing.
The partnership will 
primarily be housed at 
SCS and led by Carnegie 
Mellon faculty. The Sony 
half will be directed by Dr. 
Hiroaki Kitano, who is the 
CEO of Sony Computer 
Science Laboratories.
“This project has the 
potential to make the vast 
possibilities of AI and ro-
botics more familiar and 
accessible to the general 
public,” Kitano said. 
“It could also assist 
those for whom daily 
tasks, such as food prepa-
ration, are challenging. 
I am very excited to be 
working with the talent-
ed scientists at Carnegie 
Mellon University to make 
this vision a reality.”

Voice-activated tech-
nology may be the next big 
hit in the tech world. 
With 41.4 million us-
ers for Siri and 0.2 million 
monthly users for Cortana, 
Siri and Cortana are the 
primary competitors of 
Amazon Alexa, which has 
2.6 million users. As these 
companies compete to pro-
vide the best features in 
their voice technologies, 
users bene?t from consis-
tent improvements.
So, what is Alexa exact-
ly and how does it work?
 Alexa is a voice service 
from Amazon that powers 
“smart speaker” devices 
like the Amazon Echo, 
Echo Dot, and Amazon 
Tap. It can be found on any 
Alexa enabled device that 
is con?gured with Alexa 
voice service, such as Am-
azon’s Fire TV and tablets. 
Alexa waits for a wake 
word (“Alexa” by default) 
to start a conversation. 
Once that word is spo-
ken, Alexa begins listen-
ing to you, and then you 
can ask Alexa to do things 
for you (such as playing 
music) or use a skill you 
downloaded.
Although Siri and Cor-
tana’s user base is de-
clining, Alexa’s is consis-
tently growing. Amazon 
continues to attract de-
velopers with high-stakes 
hackathons in order to 
add to Alexa’s 15,000-plus 
skills. Alexa’s skills page 
is becoming as populated 
as the App Store, which 
makes it hard for develop-
ers to come up with new, 
unique skills. 
On the other hand, the 
challenge is also leading 
to increasingly unique 
and helpful skills for Al-
exa by forcing developers 
to think outside the box. 
With more and more skills 
on the market, Amazon 
savvily adds hackathons 
with focused agendas and 
themes to guide develop-
ers towards a certain genre 
of skills. This year’s Hack-
athon tasks participants 
with creating an everyday-
use-skill.
It seems by far the big-
gest concern for many 
Amazon customers — and 
potential customers — is 
privacy. Is Alexa listening 
to us all the time? 
Recently, Amazon 
?led a patent to allow Al-
exa to listen to people all 
the time. If the technol-
ogy is implemented, it will 
mainly be used to catch 
key words (like “love” or 
“hate”) to ?gure out what 
people like or dislike and 
make suggestions accord-
ingly.
Though this technology 
is not yet installed on Am-
azon’s devices, Alexa does 
store voice recordings of 
what users say after the 
“wake word” activates the 
device. 
While Apple’s Siri ano-
nymizes users’ recordings 
and deletes them after six 
months, Alexa stores them 
until the user chooses to 
delete them. 
This means that if a 
user is hacked — or much 
more likely, someone 
else gains login access to 
their Amazon account — 
their browsing behaviors 
and recordings can be 
accessed.
A couple of solutions 
for this are found in a 
USA Today article by Kim 
Komando. Komando sug-
gests turning off Echo’s 
mic to prevent Alexa from 
eavesdropping, turning 
off voice purchasing or 
setting a PIN code for 
purchases to secure mon-
ey transactions, and de?-
nitely checking “Drop-In” 
settings to ensure that 
no one else is listening to 
your conversations.
Amazon claims that 
Alexa’s always-listening 
technology may never hit 
the market. 
“We do not use cus-
tomers’ voice recordings 
for targeted advertising,” 
said an Amazon spokes-
person in an of?cial state-
ment. 
“Like many compa-
nies, we ?le a number of 
forward-looking patent 
applications that explore 
the full possibilities of 
new technology. Patents 
take multiple years to re-
ceive and do not neces-
sarily re?ect current de-
velopments to products 
and services.”

Special to the Tartan
Robots are becoming 
ubiquitous in industry. 
But, they’ve been held back 
from their full potential be-
cause they are dif?cult to 
incorporate into existing 
procedures: it’s too expen-
sive to rebuild an entire 
assembly line to add in a 
robot. My goal is to make 
robots easier to use than 
Legos so anyone can build 
up a custom robot.
I’d like to be able to 
carry around a bag of robot 
modules, like joints, links, 
and grippers. Then when I 
know what I want a robot 
to do, I’d tell the computer, 
and it would output the 
blueprints for a robot. I’d 
build a robot, and it would 
automatically know how 
to behave, like walk away, 
move around objects, or 
fasten screws.
Right now, I am 
focusing on automatically 
generating the design of 
robot arms specialized for 
a given job. For instance, 
I’m working with NASA to 
help design arms for fu-
ture extraplanetary rovers. 
My algorithm synthesizes 
arms iteratively: it looks at 
how well the current robot 
can achieve its task, such 
as reaching a set position 
or exerting forces on the 
environment. 
Then, using the robot’s 
equations of motion, the 
algorithm calculates what 
change in the current de-
sign would help the robot 
complete its task more ef-
?ciently. 
I look for robots that 
have fewer joints: while 
robots with fewer joints 
may be less capable of do-
ing arbitrary tasks than 
robots with many joints, 
robots with fewer joints are 
lighter, cheaper, and easier 
to control. 
In time, I hope to expand 
past designing a single limb 
at a time into designing en-
tire robots.
Last year, I worked on 
making a modular legged 
robot walk away after you 
build it, generating its be-
havior using a layered ap-
proach. My approach in-
cluded ?rst ?nding a gait 
(the cycle of motions the 
robot should go through 
to move in the right direc-
tion), then adding onto 
this a layer of compliance, 
which prescribes how the 
robot should change its mo-
tions to adapt to variations 
in terrain. Lastly, a higher-
level human or  arti?cial 
intelligence planner would 
tell the robot how to navi-
gate through the world.
A new modular 
paradigm could trans-
form how robots are used 
across many domains, so 
that robots are viewed as 
customizable tools rather 
than monolithic entities. 
A search and rescue team 
might look at a disaster 
site, and build up a custom 
robot to go in and help sur-
vey or deliver supplies. A 
space mission could have 
a use for many different 
robots, but be limited in 
the amount of weight they 
can launch, which could 
be solved by using a set 
of multi-purpose robot 
modules. A small business 
owner might need to use 
robots to stay competitive, 
but need to adapt their 
robots to a process that 
changes frequently.
Making robots readily 
customizable will bring 
costs down, while increas-
ing the scope of what ro-
bots can do, and making 
them accessible to new 
users. I’m excited to be 
part of a movement to 
democratize robotics.

Modular construction is the future of robotics
Newly public EarthTime site visualizes human impact
MARIKA YANG
Sports Editor
On Earth Day, April 
22, 2018 Carnegie Mel-
lon University and the 
World Economic Forum 
(WEF) jointly launched a 
new website to the public, 
EarthTime.org.
The interactive website 
allows people to view im-
ages of the entire world 
and the visual impact that 
humans have made (and 
continue to make) on the 
planet. Images captured 
by NASA satellites cover a 
period from 1986 to 2016.
EarthTime was created 
in a partnership between 
Carnegie Mellon’s Com-
munity Robotics, Educa-
tion and Technology Em-
powerment Lab (CREATE 
Lab), and the WEF to 
provide visual evidence 
of how humans’ decisions 
have changed the planet. 
The initiative hopes to 
help global leaders make 
well-informed and accu-
rate decisions that impact 
the Earth.
“EarthTime is a means 
to tell stories,” said Illah 
Nourbakhsh in a university 
press release. Nourbakhsh 
is a Carnegie Mellon pro-
fessor of robotics and di-
rector of the CREATE Lab 
as part of the university’s 
Robotics Institute and has 
spearheaded EarthTime’s 
development over the last 
decade. He also serves as 
a WEF Global Steward. 
“The impact of humanity 
can be seen globally and 
in individual communities 
— and at every scale in be-
tween.”
The website features 
interactive, educational 
animations called “Sto-
ries” that cover different 
topics about human-en-
vironment interaction, 
including deforestation, 
urbanization, and glacier 
retreat.
“You really can’t under-
stand climate change, mi-
gration or major social and 
political trends without ex-
amining their connections 
across time, across space 
and between each oth-
er,” added Nourbakhsh. 
“EarthTime enables you to 
do that.”
EarthTime continues 
to grow and incorporate 
numerous data sets from 
different institutional 
sources across the world. 
It uses data from govern-
ment agencies such as 
NASA and the U.S. Census, 
non-government agencies 
like the United Nations, 
and private institutions, 
including Oxford Uni-
versity, Harvard Univer-
sity, and the University of 
Maryland.
Before this public 
launch, EarthTime had 
been used within institu-
tions since 2015 at annual 
WEF events around the 
world to visualize, ana-
lyze, and understand the 
most important global is-
sues today. 
But, by going public, 
the platform can now be 
used by anyone who wants 
to know more about how 
the world has changed, 
and what they should do 
about it.

Charon gets new geographic feature names
When New Horizons  
passed Pluto’s moon 
Charon in 2015, it took 
the ?rst clear photos of the 
moon, revealing features 
on its surface — craters, 
mountains, and ravine-like 
formations called chas-
mas. Now, many of Char-
on’s features have received 
of?cial names from the 
International Astronomi-
cal Union.
Charon’s craters were 
named after legendary 
explorers, including Re-
vati of the Indian epic 
Mahabharata, and Nemo 
for Jules Verne’s ?ctional 
submarine captain. 
Chasmas were named 
after ships of myths and 
legend: Argo, Caleuche, 
and Manjet. Charon’s 
mountains received the 
names of real-life pioneers 
of science ?ction, includ-
ing Octavia Butler, Stan-
ley Kubrick, and Arthur C. 
Clarke.
Rejected names includ-
ed the names of characters 
from The Lord of the Rings 
and Marvel Comics.

Study quanti?es extensive STEM gender gap
In a comprehensive new 
study, researchers from the 
University of Melbourne 
determined the gender gap 
in research throughout the 
STEM world. 
After analyzing 36 mil-
lion authors listed on over 
10 million scienti?c ar-
ticles, they calculated the 
numerical disparity be-
tween men and women in 
nearly all ?elds of science 
and medicine in over 100 
countries.
Senior researchers (for 
example, ?rst authors) 
were more likely to be 
men, and junior research-
ers were more likely to be 
women. 
Wealthy countries like 
Japan and Germany had 
signi?cantly bigger gen-
der gaps than developing 
countries. 
Of the ?elds of study 
analyzed, 20 percent were 
very close to gender parity 
(within ?ve percent).
The data has been made 
public online, so that deci-
sion makers can use it to 
keep informed.

“True seals” hunt at sea like relatives on land
“True seals” like harbor 
seals and harp seals retain 
the claws that helped their 
ancestors hunt on land. 
These claws are not just 
remnants of the past; they 
actively help these mod-
ern seals in their ocean 
hunting, marine biologists 
reported April 18 in Royal 
Society Open Science.
The biologists, led 
by David Hocking from 
Monash University in Mel-
bourne, Australia, spent 
hundreds of hours observ-
ing wild seals hunting in 
Scotland and watching 
seals eat in captivity. The 
true seals relied heavily on 
their claws to hunt and eat, 
resembling the use of claws 
in land hunters like bears. 
Claws let true seals hunt 
bigger prey, the research-
ers concluded. They caught 
prey underwater and tore it 
apart when they surfaced, 
as opposed to seals and sea 
lions who lack claws and 
tend to pursue prey that 
they can swallow whole 
and immediately, like small 
?sh.

Pecking ravens derail LIGO data collection
At the Advanced Laser 
Interferometer Gravita-
tional-Wave Observatory 
(LIGO), scientists noticed 
an unusual signal that 
didn’t resemble the gravi-
tational waves LIGO was 
designed to detect.
When LIGO scientists in-
vestigated, they found that 
the signal was the sound 
of pecking birds, picked up 
by a microphone meant to 
monitor LIGO’s environ-
ment.
The pecking sound was 
from ravens, who had been 
pecking at an outdoor cool-
ing pipe. The birds were 
snacking on the ice crystals 
forming on the outside of 
the pipe to get some cool 
relief from the heat.
The setup has since been 
altered so that the pipes will 
no longer accumulate ice.

Every year, Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Spring 
Carnival features many 
exciting events, from the 
creativity of Booth at 
Midway to the bright colors 
of Holi on the Mall. One 
event that stands above the 
rest as a true year-round 
event is Sweepstakes, better 
known as Buggy.
The talented and 
experienced women’s 
and men’s teams from the 
Student Dormitory Council 
(SDC) dominated the ?eld, 
as they have for the past 
several years. While neither 
the men’s or women’s teams 
broke any records that were 
set in last year’s races, the 
day was still ?lled with fun 
and drama.
The 99th annual Buggy 
races were held on Friday 
and Saturday on the 
campus’s 0.84-mile race 
course starting at Tech and 
Frew Streets. Buggy refers 
to the compact unmotorized 
vehicle that holds a driver, 
and is pushed across the 
mainly uphill track by ?ve 
different pushers, a relay 
race of sorts where the 
buggy is the baton.
After months of 
engineering a sleek, fast bug-
gy and training early in the 
morning, the teams raced 
in the preliminary heats 
on Friday. On the women’s 
side, three teams from SDC, 
three from Fringe, two from 
Carnegie Involvement As-
sociation (CIA), one from 
Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA), and 
one from SPIRIT quali?ed 
for the 10-team ?nal.
Teams SDC B and Fringe 
C kicked off the women’s 
?nals in the ?rst heat. SDC 
B quickly moved ahead 
on Hill 1, and built on the 
lead throughout the race. 
They ?nished with a time of 
2:37.49, nearly 15 seconds 
ahead of Fringe C’s 2:52.16 
time, and good enough for 
fourth place.
Another team from SDC, 
SDC C, faced off against 
Fringe A in the next race. 
Fringe A established a quick 
lead moving in to the free 
roll, the downhill section in 
the middle of the race when 
the driver in the buggy 
steers without help from 
pushers. Fringe A’s ?nal time 
of 2:38.87 was slower than 
their preliminary time on 
Day 1, but was still enough 
to beat SDC C’s time of 
2:56.95.
The third race of the day 
featured two teams from 
the same organization, 
CIA A and CIA B. The race 
began close on Hills 1 and 
2, but CIA A pulled away 
in later sections. While CIA 
A’s 2:36.36 time was half 
a second slower than their 
preliminary time, CIA B’s 
2:44.84 ?nals time shaved 
off nearly four seconds from 
their preliminary time.
Racing against Fringe 
B, PiKA A got off to a hot 
start with a big push on Hill 
1. Some shaky transitions 
slowed them down, allowing 
Fringe B to make up some 
ground in one of the closer 
races of the day. PiKA A 
?nished in 2:35.01, slower 
than in the preliminary 
races, and Fringe B crossed 
the line in 2:39.77, over 
three seconds faster than 
their previous time.
In the ?nal race of the 
women’s competition, SDC 
A looked to defend their win 
from 2017’s Sweepstakes. 
While the race was more 
SDC A against its own 
record, SPIRIT A challenged 
them, staying with SDC A in 
Hill 1, before falling behind 
in the transition into Hill 2. 
SDC A won the competition 
with a time of 2:23.60, 
over 11 seconds faster 
than second-place ?nisher 
PiKA A. SPIRIT A ?nished 
in 2:39.06, fast enough to 
make the six-team podium.
In the men’s competition, 
two teams from SDC, two 
teams from CIA, two teams 
from Sigma Phi Epsilon 
(SigEp), two teams from 
PiKA, one team from Fringe, 
and one team from Apex 
quali?ed for the 10-team 
?nal, while four teams, one 
from Apex, SPIRIT, SDC, 
and Sigma Alpha Epsilon 
(SAE) each, competed in 
solo re-rolls down the track.
Fringe B and SigEp C 
participated in the ?rst 
race of Saturday’s men’s 
?nals. Fringe B quickly 
made separation from 
SigEp C, and ?nished in 
2:15.53, a second faster 
than their preliminary 
time. Unfortunately, SigEp 
C’s ?fth and ?nal pusher 
suffered a leg injury on Hill 
5, struggling but managing 
to ?nish the race in 2:39.51.
In their race, both CIA A 
and PiKA B were very strong 
on the ?rst two hills, and 
stayed very close in their 
pushes into the free roll. CIA 
A took the inside line of the 
roll, forcing PiKA B to let off 
speed to prevent contact. 
Though PiKA B made up 
some ground at Hill 4, CIA 
A ?nished the race ?rst 
in 2:12.96, with PiKA B 
following with a great time 
of 2:17.30, over four seconds 
faster than their preliminary 
time.
SDC B and CIA B 
competed in the next race. 
CIA B won Hill 1, but a small 
stumble in the transition to 
Hill 2 cost them the lead. 
The SDC B pushers gained a 
large lead in the ?nal three 
hills to ?nish in 2:12.77. CIA 
B ?nished in 2:16.45.
The penultimate race 
of the event had the most 
dramatic moment of the 
races. Racing against Apex 
A, PiKA A pulled ahead on 
Hill 1, but spun out and 
hit the hay in the free roll. 
While they did not ?nish, 
Apex A crossed the line in 
2:20.61.
Like in the women’s 
competition, the ?nal race 
was less about the two teams 
racing at the same time and 
more about SDC A racing 
against its own records. 
SigEp A ?nished in 2:14.69, 
over three seconds faster 
than their preliminary time 
and good for fourth place, 
but the real show was SDC 
A.
At every section, SDC A 
gained speed and eventually 
?nished in 2:03.17, short 
of the record time 2:02.16 
set last year, but more 
than enough to win the 
team’s seventh consecutive 
Sweepstakes championship.
The ?nal results of 
the competition were not 
surprising, but the fun and 
excitement of Buggy remains 
each year, as members 
of the Carnegie Mellon 
community, both current 
and from the past, come to 
watch a staple in the univer-
sity’s history and an integral 
part of its community.
SDC teams dominate 99th annual Buggy competition

With both the 2018 
Formula 1 (F1) and IndyCar 
championships three races 
in, it is shaping up to be an 
enticing, drama ?lled year 
for the two motorsports 
series. In F1, the highest 
level of world-wide open-
wheel racing, Mercedes’ 
long-held dominance 
appears to ?nally be over, 
with Mercedes languishing 
behind the quick race pace 
of the Ferraris. In IndyCar, 
an America-only open 
wheel series, 2016 Indy 500 
winner Alexander Rossi has 
extended his strong second 
half of 2017 into the new 
year with two podiums 
and a race win so far, while 
reigning champion Josef 
Newgarden, with one 2018 
win to his name, is not far 
behind.
In 2014, F1 cars switched 
from screaming V8 engines 
to turbocharged V6 hybrid 
units, and the “hybrid era” 
has since been controlled 
by Mercedes. The team 
handily won in 2014, with 
their driver Lewis Hamilton 
beating his teammate Nico 
Rosberg to the Drivers’ title. 
2015 was much of the same, 
although Rosberg put up a 
stronger ?ght. In 2016, the 
teammates clashed both on 
and off the track, with several 
collisions causing their 
relationship to deteriorate 
as they ?ercely battled for 
the championship; Rosberg 
won and subsequently 
retired, with Mercedes 
yet again easily taking the 
Constructors’ trophy. 2017 
saw Ferrari begin to catch 
up: while Hamilton and 
Mercedes still triumphed, 
Ferrari driver and four-time 
world champion Sebastian 
Vettel won ?ve races and 
even led during the ?rst half 
of the season.
With the dust settled 
from the ?rst three races 
of 2018, it is evident that 
Mercedes no longer has 
the clear upper hand. The 
season’s ?rst grand prix in 
Australia saw Vettel win 
due to excellent strategy 
from Ferrari, pitting with 
the lead when a stopped 
car brought a Virtual Safety 
Car (VSC) period, allowing 
him to retain the lead since 
Hamilton had to slow down 
to obey the VSC speed limit. 
The other Ferrari of Kimi 
Raikkonen was also fast, 
placing third, while the 
other Mercedes of Valtteri 
Bottas ?nished a distant 
eighth due to a crash in the 
qualifying race dropping his 
starting position to 15th.
In an action-packed 
Bahrain Grand Prix, Vettel 
barely coaxed his worn 
tires to a second victory, 
ahead of the chasing Bottas, 
who ?nished a mere 0.699 
seconds behind. Hamilton 
desperately searched for 
pace, ?nishing six seconds 
down in third, while a 
mistimed pit stop sent a 
Ferrari mechanic to the 
hospital with a fractured leg 
and a disgruntled Raikkonen 
back to the garage with no 
points.
In China, Ferrari seemed 
to retain their advantage 
over Mercedes, with Vettel 
quickly crafting a sizable 
lead over Bottas while 
Hamilton struggled to keep 
up. However, the safety car 
appeared when the two Toro 
Rosso cars collided on lap 
31, letting Red Bull drivers 
Max Verstappen and Daniel 
Ricciardo pit for new tires, 
giving them more pace 
when the race restarted. 
The two Red Bulls blew past 
Raikkonen and Hamilton, 
but Verstappen tried an 
ambitious late-braking move 
against Vettel on the 43rd 
lap, causing both drivers 
to spin out. Verstappen 
was promptly handed a ten 
second time penalty, putting 
him down in ?fth behind 
Hamilton, while Vettel slid 
down the ?eld, coming home 
a measly eighth. Meanwhile, 
Ricciardo set after Bottas, 
eventually grabbing the 
lead on lap 45 with a ballsy 
move down the inside of 
the Mercedes into the tight 
right-hander of turn four. 
While Hamilton ?nished 
ahead of Vettel and inched 
closer in the standings, the 
Mercedes duo had trouble 
matching the speed of 
the Ferraris all weekend, 
and the quick Vettel was 
an unfortunate victim of 
Verstappen’s overzealous 
passing attempt.
Vettel currently leads 
the championship with 54 
points. Hamilton is nine 
points back, with Bottas a 
further ?ve behind that. 
Ricciardo is nipping at the 
Mercedes’ heels after his race 
win with 37 points, while 
Raikkonen sits ?fth with 
30. Verstappen’s dif?cult 
start leaves him in eighth, 
getting him tangled up in 
the intense mid-?eld battle 
between the McLaren’s 
Fernando Alonso, Renault’s 
Nico Hulkenberg, and 
Haas’s Kevin Magnussen. 
In the Constructors’ 
Championship, Mercedes 
leads Ferrari by a single 
point, while Red Bull lurks 
29 points behind.
Over in the United 
States, the IndyCar season 
is providing lots of exciting 
racing as Rossi looks to 
build an early championship 
lead. The opening street 
race in St. Petersburg, FL 
saw four-time champion 
Sebastian Bourdais snatch 
his 74th win, after Rossi 
made contact with rookie 
Robert Wickens on lap 108 
of 110 while battling for the 
lead. Rossi fought back to 
?nish third. The reigning 
champion Newgarden had a 
tricky race down in seventh, 
while Graham Rahal 
?nished second.
Newgarden had better 
luck at the oval circuit of 
Phoenix, where he used a 
late pit stop to don fresh tires 
and make up four places in 
seven laps to win ahead of 
Wickens and Rossi.
Rossi stormed to an 
assertive win at the Long 
Beach street circuit, where 
he led all but 14 of 85 laps. 
Former champion Will 
Power ?nished second, 
while Ed Jones rounded out 
the podium. Newgarden 
yet again ?nished seventh, 
while Bourdais ?nished 
down in 13th despite some 
masterful passing moves. 
The win elevated Rossi to 
?rst in the championship 
with 126 points, while 
Newgarden sits second with 
104. Rahal and Bourdais are 
third and fourth with 93 and 
88 points, respectively.
IndyCar moves to the 
race circuit of Barber 
Motorsports Park for the 
Grand Prix of Alabama on 
April 22, while F1 travels 
to the capital of Baku for 
the Azerbaijan Grand Prix 
season on April 29.

On your post-Carnival recovery plan
Dear Izzy,
Sadly, Carnival is over and done, but school is 
not. I completely did not expect how much work 
I still had to do, and now it’s Sunday and I’m 
not only hungover but absolutely drowning in 
work. Everything feels like it’s coming around so 
soon, with final papers, exams, and pesky group 
projects and I have absolutely no idea what to 
do about it. It’s like, I’m trying to recover and 
get back to work this week but I don’t have the 
motivation, and I’ve also been trying to get on 
top of my work for so long, but I’m worried it’ll 
all come crashing down in the next two weeks. Do 
you have any advice to help me stay afloat?
Help! Under No Grade Obligations, Very 
Exasperated, Response?
Dear HUNGOVER,
Don’t worry, you’re almost there! Not that you 
didn’t know that already. But, here are some tips 
that’ll help you generate a final push to end the 
semester strong.
Schedule out those exam dates and due dates for 
projects, work a little bit on assignments and study 
different topics each day so you’re not cramming 
the day before, take a break during that studying 
when you need to, and so on. You’ve probably 
heard all those already. But, I also wanted to give 
you advice that’s a little bit different.
Be aware of what your body and mind need. If 
you are feeling hungry, take a break to get some 
food and eat while you work. If you’re feeling 
motivated or have a good idea, then great, 
stick to your work to get all those ideas out! If 
you’re tired, then dear God please just go to 
sleep. You’ll feel a lot better later because you’re 
getting what you need.
If you’re feeling stressed, please take a break 
— and don’t be afraid to reach out to friends if 
you need support. I am not sure what happened 
with you during Carnival, but I’m worried that 
the fact that you need to recover now means that 
something serious happened. Even if nothing did, 
talking to friends is always a good outlet for your 
stress. Everything will be okay in the end.
The most important thing is that whatever you’re 
feeling, don’t hold it in. Be upfront about things 
and don’t be afraid to confront challenges, 
because you’ll be able to focus a lot more on 
your work when you’ve gotten all your personal 
problems out of the way.
Hope this helps,
Izzy
Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Tequila Cowboy
This week I ventured to the North Shore to finally 
see the place, the myth, the legend: Tequila 
Cowboy. I had heard tales of the mechanical bulls, 
the karaoke, and the country music, and finally it 
was time for me to experience it for myself. Saddle 
up, because this place is definitely a wild ride.
The location: Tequila Cowboy, located on North 
Shore Drive is about as North Shore as you 
can get without getting in the water. It’s right 
down the street from PNC Park and conveniently 
placed on a long strip of bars. If you find yourself 
overwhelmed here, you can venture down 
McFadden’s, Bar Louie, or even the Southern Tier 
Brewing Co. (which I an dying to get to). You 
can also just stroll along the North Shore, but I 
guarantee if you pop in to Tequila Cowboy, you 
won’t just be staying for one drink.
The drinks: As you may know by now, I have a 
tradition of buying one expensive drink at a bar 
before resorting to a typical mixed drink or cheap 
beer just so I can say I’ve had one of the bar’s 
signature drinks. This weekend was no different 
and Tequila Cowboy did not disappoint. No, I did 
not have tequila, because I am still abstaining from 
that devil drink since Bakersfield, so I opted for a 
mule. 
Tequila Cowboy’s mule features fresh pureed 
ginger which made them way too easy to drink. 
I tried the Nashville Mule with Old Camp Peach 
Pecan Whiskey, ginger puree, lime, sprite, and 
soda water. Of course mules are expensive, so I 
knew what I was getting into here, but the mixed 
drinks and beer weren’t too bad in price and 
taste.
The vibe: There’s a mechanical bull here, do I even 
need to say more? No, I didn’t get on it because 
as you can imagine, the line is a bit crazy on a 
Saturday night, but I had a great time watching 
others fall off. Growing up in Texas and going to 
the rodeo to see the real bull rides almost every 
year, I did feel like it was my responsibility to 
represent my state well, so maybe you’ll catch me 
up there next time. There’s also a back section 
of the bar that feels a bit separate from the front 
which houses karaoke and a separate bar. Both 
halves of the bar were equally as exciting and 
definitely worth stopping by.
Lit or nah: I don’t know if it’s possible for a bar 
with a mechanical bull not to be lit. It’s also 
huge and was completely packed so it definitely 
passes the lit-mus test. If you’re not a country fan, 
this might not be your place, but honestly it’s so 
loud that you don’t even realize country music is 
playing most of the time. There’s also the separate 
karaoke area that is playing whatever song people 
are currently singing. From the drinks to the music 
to the atmosphere, Tequila Cowboy is really a 
place that lets you grab life by the horns.
Grab your friends by the horns for a fun night.

On Thursday, April 19, Carnegie Mellon’s Activities Board (AB) went back to its tradition of 
hosting a major act during their Carnival Comedy show. Unlike its experiment with a series of 
comedy acts last year, this spring, AB brought the acclaimed Chris Gethard to the cozy stage of 
McConomy auditorium. Gethard is best known for hosting his own talk show, called The Chris 
Gethard Show, which takes place in New York City. Opening for Gethard was Tim Dillon, who 
was featured in a list written by the Rolling Stone as one of the “10 Comedians You Need to 
Know.” The packed auditorium was in for an eventful night, which took place over the course of 
two hours.
The night started off with newly announced AB comedy chair Jon Goodstein, a first-year 
chemistry major, throwing free baseball caps to an excited and loud audience. When 
Dillon shortly came on stage, the self-described gay comedian joked that colleges were 
“wasting parents’ money on comedy.” The comment acted as a sort of prelude to Dillon’s 
personality throughout the first part of the show. From calling a whole row of drama 
majors in the audience future Panera bread workers to labeling cruises as simply “floating 
buffet[s],” Dillon exerted himself as someone who is not afraid to speak his mind. While bold, 
his statements were oftentimes backed by rationalization, which took the form of boisterous rants. 
As he made many amusing jabs at society, Dillon did not shy away from self-deprecatory humor. 
He said that once, his friends told him he looked like “Steve Bannon driving a Lyft.” Dillon also 
had the ability to talk at great speeds, which instilled plenty of robust energy throughout the first 
part of the show.
Afterward, Dillon gave way to Gethard, who proved to be the star of the night. Although having 
a softer voice than Dillon, Gethard was more skillful at pacing his talk and had a genius for story-
telling. While both comedians were able to incorporate the audience into their act, Gethard had 
a particularly funny and memorable interaction to share. Prior to the show, Gethard received an 
Instagram message from one of the audience members, who appeared to be an avid fan of the 
comedian. Gethard described how he nearly had a heart attack when the sender said that she 
was the only one in line for the show, minutes before it was set to start. However, Gethard’s fear 
proved to be wrong as he was embraced by a receptive audience throughout the night.
During the second part of the show, Gethard touched on a variety of topics, from his perception 
of Pittsburgh as an industrial city with a hipster vibe to an amusing pun on his last name. A major

---------------------------------------------------

part of the show, however, dealt with Gethard’s experiences as he was growing up in New Jersey. In an initially heartwarming tale 
from his high school years, Gethard talked about how his anger at a bully gave his 13-year-old self the drive to achieve his goals 
later on in life. However, Gethard then apologized for the not-so-inspirational story, as he disclosed the infuriating fact that his high 
school bully went on to become richer, and could afford more expensive horses than the comedian. Gethard also talked about his 
acceptance that he never will fit into society’s definition of being “cool.” His self-disclosure would transition into a recollection of 
what he had felt to be his “coolest moment” in life. In an effort to say “something cool” in front of his friend, 16-year-old Gethard 
once unabashedly admitted to his strict father that he and his friend “have been drinking [beers] all night long.” While his stories 
revealed a more serious theme concerning the struggles of his adolescence, Gethard maintained the hilarity of the show with his 
upbeat personality.
Gethard’s ability to tease out humor in any topic also shines through his discussion of many normally depressing topics, including 
rudeness of some hurried New Yorkers, the harmful effects of cultural stereotypes, as well as the stress behind the way gun issues in 
America are being framed as solely mental health issues. The comedian also went into more light-hearted, but stranger topics, from 
a friend’s sexual experimentation with a couch to the terrifying thrills of Gatorland, an amusement park in Florida dedicated to the 
crude feeding of animals to alligators. It appears that his entire life could be one large comedy show, but much of Gethard’s ability 
to engage his audience can be attributed to his knack for vividly recreating the past, as well as his effortless skill at impersonating 
different kinds of people.
Indeed, by the end of the show, the self-described “grown-up version” of Calvin from Calvin and Hobbes left a roaring and satisfied 
audience, signalling a success for this year’s AB Carnival Comedy committee.

Scotch’n’Soda Presents:
Scotch’n’Soda’s annual Carnival show is a dynamic smash hit.
6
Taking place in Rangos Ballroom in the Cohon Center last week, 
Scotch’n’Soda’s Spring Carnival show Chicago was one of the most 
thrilling events of the year and stunned audience members with high 
energy dance numbers, wonderful singing, and an all-around enter-
taining show. Directed by junior and computational finance major 
Adam Lerner and first-year Dietrich College of Humanities and Social 
Sciences student Maxine Ewing, this production was beautifully done 
with a simplistic set, high quality music, and great utilization of the 
space.
The set featured two black curved platforms on each side of the stage 
rimmed with bright light bulbs that entranced guests with lighting cues 
that matched each elaborate number. In the center, the instru-
mentalists sat on raked steps with black 
and white designed music stands. It 
was truly an immersive experience 
for audience members to witness.
The show, taking place in 1920s Chicago, features two similar women, 
Roxie Hart and Velma Kelly, who have each murdered their lovers. 
They attempt to gain publicity through choice words and actions in 
front of Chicago judges and the public. Featuring some raunchy num-
bers and hilarious characters, this has to be one of the most beloved 
Broadway shows.
The numbers were all high energy with elaborately choreographed 
routines by senior biology and chemistry double major Sarah Deluty, 
sophomore music student Emmi Dolph, and sophomore and decision 
sciences and engineering and public policy major Molly Rohrer. With 
spectacular attention to detail in body movement, this choreography 
captured the 1920s essence that was very entertaining to 
watch.
The equally amazing musicianship 
of musical directors, junior music 
student Caleb Glickman and 

---------------------------------------------------

sophomore music student Emma McAlister, brought the sound of 
Roxie and Velma’s world to life for audiences. The harmonies, 
intonation, and quality of each singer in the production was very 
well done and allowed the audience to feel like they wanted to 
get up and sing as well.
The costuming was terrifically done as well with all characters in 
black and white with the exception of the leads. Roxie, played 
by electrical & computer engineering senior Tara Stentz, sported 
a fire truck red dress whereas Velma, played by junior psychol-
ogy and decision sciences double major Heather Graci, had on 
a stunning gold and black dress. The costuming fit well with the 
show as to not distract from the singing and dancing but rather 
to add flavor and interest to the production.
In total, the production was a smash hit with lines out the door 
of people swaiting to get a glimpse of this wonderfully talented 
cast. All in all, it was a successful production of Chicago done 
by Carnegie Mellon’s Scotch’n’Soda at this year’s Spring 
Carnival.

booth
It’s that time of the year again — 
when Carnegie Mellon students 
pick up their drills and strap on 
their hardhats to build booths. 
Booth is one of the biggest attrac-
tions of Spring Carnival, featuring 
multistory structures, interactive 
games, and beautiful decorations. 
After unrelenting weather among 
other challenges, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Greek and student organizations 
persevered to build booths centered 
on this year’s theme, Myths and 
Legends. These organizations com-
pete in four categories: Sorority, 
Fraternity, Independent, and Blitz. 
Participating but not competing, 
Alpha Phi Omega built a Greek 
Underworld-themed concession 
stand, where all proceeds went to 
fundraising the service fraternity.
One of the biggest sorority booths 
was Kappa Alpha Theta’s Titanic. 
Built to resemble the iconic ship, 
the two-story booth featured elabo-
rate decorations: a spiral staircase, 
paintings of the characters from the 
1997 movie of the same name, and 
jellyfish lighted with eerie green 
lighting. The booth did a wonderful 
job telling a story, and combined 
the experience with a digital escape 
room game; you entered as a 
passenger on the Titanic, walking 
through the main “lobby” of the 
ship and up the staircase. Red light-
ing and fire cutouts signaled that the 
ship was on fire and going down, 
as visitors walked down the stairs 
into the briny green ocean. Exiting 
the booth meant you successfully 
escaped the ship and survived. 
Kappa Alpha Theta won second 
place for their Titanic booth.
Right next door was Alpha Phi’s 
Narnia. This booth told the story 
of The Lion, the Witch, and the 
Wardrobe, from The Chronicles of 
Narnia by C. S. Lewis. With large 
3D paintings of characters like Aslan 
and the White Witch, the booth 
showcased Alpha Phi’s incredible 
art and design skills. On the second 
floor, visitors could play a shooting 
game with a toy bow and arrow, 
participating in Aslan’s final battle 
against the Witch. The many elabo-
rate decorative chairs and a small 
swing decorated with flowers and 
butterflies made the booth a popu-
lar photo spot for Carnival visitors.
The first place winner of the sorority 
booths, Kappa Kappa Gamma’s 
Alice in Wonderland, was a sight 
to be seen. Beautifully painted and 
fun, the two-story booth featured a 
wall of roses, referencing the Queen 
of Heart’s rose obsession, a room 
lighted by black light to simulate 
the craziness of Wonderland, and 
a short interactive game where the 
player would collect items as Alice. 
Kappa Kappa Gamma’s hard work 
payed off with their impressive 
display.
Delta Delta Delta built a booth 
featuring the Greek god of the sea, 
Poseidon. With an impressive paint-
ing of the god of the ocean at the 
entrance, the one-story booth told 
a fun tale of ocean-themed Greek 
mythology. The booth also featured 
a ring toss game, where the player 
would toss rings onto a coral sculp-
ture. If the player won, they got 
to walk out with a small prize: a 
laser-cut dolphin. 
The last of the sorority booths was 
Delta Gamma’s Santa’s Workshop. 
Cleverly decorated with small pieces 
of plywood to create a brick wall, 
the cheerful booth made the recent 
snow less miserable. With cute cut-
outs of Santa’s reindeer, colorful 
Christmas lights and a Christmas 
tree, Delta Gamma brought back 
the spirit of Christmas to Carnival.
One of the biggest fraternity booths 
was Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Star Trek. 
Emblazoned with a Star Trek-
themed logo and the show’s iconic 
USS Enterprise, the booth featured 
a number of tech-based displays. 
The bottom floor had an impressive 
transporter bay, while the top floor 
featured an incredible interactive 
game. The elaborate booth placed 
second place in the fraternity cat-
egory. 
Just across Midway was Phi Delta 
Theta’s Moon Landing. This booth 
was an especially popular one due 
to its green screen photo booth and 
two-story-tall rocket. 
Proudly displaying the organiza-
tion’s flag and many of its members 
photoshopped as astronauts, the 
booth featured incredible artwork 
and created a fun, cohesive theme. 
Next door was Alpha Sigma Phi’s 
The Sandlot. Based off of the movie 
of the same name, the small single-
story booth was a fun baseball-
themed game. Even though they 
were partially deterred by the 
previous nights of terrible weather, 
the booth was fun and extremely 
popular with kids.
Another two-story fraternity booth 
was Sigma Phi Epsilon’s Legend of 
Zelda. Using artwork inspired by 
the various Legend of Zelda games, 
the booth incorporated interactivity 
into its decorations. Using a small 
Zelda-decorated coin, the visitor 
could interact with objects in the 
booth, causing them to light up or 
make a sound. The booth was beau-
tifully decorated with faux stained 
glass windows and sculptures of 
Zelda-themed enemies, and featured 
a small video game on the second 
floor. The booth placed third in the 
fraternity category.
The winner of the fraternity category 
was Delta Tau Delta’s Harry Potter 
booth. Built to resemble part of

Hogwarts castle, the booth took 
the visitor on a journey through the 
many locations in the world of Harry 
Potter. From Ollivander’s to the halls 
of Hogwarts to a running fountain 
on the second floor to paintings of 
the iconic characters, the booth was 
incredibly well-designed and well-
built. One of the many cool aspects 
was an interactive plate sorted 
visitors into Hogwarts houses.
Located at the entrance of Midway 
was KGB’S Aliens booth. Single 
story, it featured conspiracy-related 
decorations and articles, all pointing 
towards the existence of alien life. 
Coming to the exit of the booth was 
an Operation-based alien game, 
where the player could extract mis-
cellaneous objects from the body 
of an alien. KGB members were 
expert participants, quickly crafting 
tin foil hats to protect their visitors 
from potential dangers — alien or 
otherwise.
Fringe built a Robin Hood-themed 
booth, with a beautiful banner and 
cut-outs of the animated movie’s 
characters decorating the front of the 
booth. You walked through Robin 
Hood’s forest, passing by sculptures 
of trees and even more beautifully 
painted characters, exploring the 
world of the movie. The booth also 
featured a shooting game, where the 
player could use a bow and arrow 
to hit targets mounted on the wall. 
Although they didn’t place, the booth 
was fun and well-designed.
Second place in the Independent 
category was Student Dormitory 
Council’s (SDC) Trojan Horse. 
Decorated with the enormous head 
of the Trojan horse itself, the booth 
was one impressive game. As you 
passed by Greek-themed urns and 
pots, the visitor could read up on 
the tale of the Trojan horse. In one 
game, the player could use small 
cutouts to simulate the battle. In 
the other game, the player could 
use a nerf gun to hit timed targets. 
The SDC’s hard work resulted in an 
impressive and entertaining booth.
The Singapore Students Association 
(SSA) built a Merlion booth. With 
the head of lion on one side of the 
entrance and the tail of a mermaid 
on the other, the booth was covered 
wall-to-wall with blackboard. Visitors 
could draw and decorate the booth 
using chalk provided by SSA, which 
resulted in a colorful array of mes-
sages and doodles. Along the walls 
were lit-up laser-cut sculptures of the 
ocean and other Merlion-related 
locations. In the center of the booth 
was a small sandpit, which was 
popular with kids and families.
Winning first place in the Independent 
category was the Taiwanese Student 
Association’s Arabian Nights booth. 
Complete with sand, a magic carpet, 
the soundtrack of Aladdin, and a 
blue genie, the booth took the visitor 
on a trip through Agrabah. With its 
elaborately painted decorations, the 
booth really told the story of Aladdin 
and wonderfully encompassed the 
world of the theme.
The last Independent booth was the 
Asian Students Association’s (ASA) 
The Legend of Korra. This booth 
told the story of the animated series 
using a variety of lights and sculp-
tures, taking the visitor on a journey 
through the streets of the main city 
and into the spirit world. Featuring 
a fun game where the player could 
“bend” evil spirits into good ones 
and a cute tea party-themed photo 
op by the exit, ASA earned third 
place with their exciting booth.
The last category is Blitz. Where 
other booths are allowed to bring 
in already-built frames and pieces, 
Blitz booths cannot pre-build any-
thing. Starting only a couple days 
before opening, these booths 
expertly managed time and weather 
to create single-story structures.
The Chinese Students Association 
built a booth on the theme of 
China’s Great Wall. Beautifully dec-
orated with Ancient Chinese-themed 
art and motifs, the booth was 
impressively designed and painted. 
The American Society of Civil 
Engineers built an Area 51 themed 
booth, located at the end of 
Midway. While small, the booth 
featured a “conspiracy map”, with 
tacks placed where all of Carnegie 
Mellon’s affiliated schools were 
located (including Central Michigan 
University). Visitors could look 
through a periscope to see the rest 
of Midway, as a form of surveil-
lance. But, most entertaining was 
the booth’s wall of index cards — 
each with a different “conspiracy” 
on them. Featuring theories such as 
“Water is wet” and “The real Avril 
Lavigne is Dead,” the wall was a 
fun way to incorporate visitor par-
ticipation. The playful booth won 
second place in the Blitz category.
Winning third place was Astronomy 
Club’s Constellations-themed booth. 
The main attraction of the booth 
was its large wall-to-wall video 
game, where two people played 
as spaceships trying to track down 
the correct constellation. Decorated 
with amazing artwork of constel-
lations and celestial bodies, the 
Astronomy club showed off their art 
and technical skills. Kappa Sigma’s 
booth was built on the legend of 
The Yeti. Impressive in its own right, 
the booth featured “cool” artwork 
and a well-designed structure. Along 
with their theme, the organization 
sold ice cream to passing Carnival 
visitors.
Winning first place in the 
Blitz category was Math Club’s 
Merlin’s Quest booth. With the 
story of Merlin’s multiple quests 
written on the walls, visitors could 
decode Merlin’s messages using a 
variety of historical ciphers. Once 
the many messages were decoded 
and the puzzles solved, the visitor 
could “pull” the sword in the stone 
out of its boulder to reveal 
collectible stickers. The booth right-
fully won first place with its clever 
games and fun design.

ALLIES:
The Day of Silence, started in 1996 at the University of Virginia and organized by the Gay, 
Lesbian, and Straight Education Network (GLSEN), is observed annually in the United States 
and many other countries and serves to acknowledge those in the LGBTQ+ community who 
have been harassed or bullied due to their identities.
“Breaking the Silence” with their Open Mic Night on Thursday, April 26, CMU ALLIES wishes 
for members of the community to showcase their identities through poetry, music, and other 
performances following their annual Day of Silence event in order to, as they stated on their 
Facebook page, “spotlight the challenges that marginalized groups silently face and speak 
out about them, in a sense breaking the silence of Day of Silence.”
As Carnegie Mellon’s LGBTQ+ organization, ALLIES strives to bring the community together 
and make the campus more inclusive. According to their website, “We are ALLIES because 
we are not a single mass; we are all ALLIED with each other through supporting our own 
individual lives and experiences.” With events throughout the year such as Open Mic Nights, 
visibility and awareness days, the Westboro Baptist Church counter-protest, and more, they 
bring awareness to issues regarding gender and orientation.
In addition to LGBTQ+ issues, ALLIES “encourages performers to focus on the different as-
pects of their identity” at the “Breaking the Silence” Open Mic Night this Thursday from 8 to 
9:30 p.m. in the Cohon Center Studio Theater. Additionally, if anyone has questions or wishes 
to perform on Thursday, contact allies.open.mic@gmail.com.
ALLIES also hosts social events and has weekly meetings on Wednesdays at 5 p.m. in Soho, 
Cohon Center Room 335, and holds open ofice hours for those who need support.

“BREAKING THE SILENCE”

---------------------------------------------------

For this year’s Carnival Concert, artists Wale and Shlohmo were the main per-
formers. This was a highly anticipated concert, especially since many seemed 
to be interested in the pairing of Shlohmo’s electronic music with Wale’s rap 
music. Wale is a rapper well known for his feel-good sampling and remixes 
of popular songs; some of his tracks remind me of Kanye West’s music. 
Shlohmo, on the other hand has more of a relaxed and soothing vibe to his 
music, incorporating very unique sounds and beats to his songs. Before the 
concert, I had never heard of Shlohmo, and I only knew of the song “MY 
PYT” by Wale. I was excited to hear more of their music and learn more 
about both of the artists.
My friend and I arrived a little bit before 7 p.m. to find a spot up close to the 
stage. During that time, we were both really excited to have fun and dance 
to new music. We had been talking to others in line who were already fans 
of Wale, and they talked about how different his rap music was from other 
famous artists. I don’t think, however, we had met anyone who knew of 
Shlohmo before the event. While waiting for the concert to start, it was awe-
some seeing Activities Board (AB) Tech test out all the lights and effects. 
Having a spot all the way upfront near the stage, the lights were definitely 
blinding and the fog machines were very much in-your-face, however it all 
added to my and my friend’s excitement for the concert.
Over an hour passed and there were still no performers on stage. All the 
stage effects were still being used and loud music was playing, making the 
Cut resemble a stuffy 
night club. It seemed like half the audience was getting annoyed waiting for 
someone to perform, while the other half didn’t care and danced to the pop 
and rap music AB Tech put on. Overall, many people were just very confused, 
including me and my friend.
At some point during the concert, someone came on stage (who was neither 
Shlohmo nor Wale) and started playing electronic music. However, nobody 
knew that he was Com Truise, another DJ, because no one came out to 
introduce him. For another hour or so Com Truise continued playing music 
while many still appeared to be confused, wondering where Wale or Shlohmo 
were. By around 9 p.m. Wale came on stage and the entire audience cheered. 
It was nice to see that most of the audience still had so much energy and 
excitement, because, honestly at that point, I was already tired.
I did enjoy Wale’s music and he performed fun, upbeat songs like “My 
Love” featuring Major Lazer, Wizkid, and Dua Lipa, and 2009 throwback song 
“Chillin” featuring Lady Gaga. For a bit, I was able to dance and have a good 
time, but very quickly the area near the stage became packed with people and 
there was barely any space to move. At one point, a good number of people 
around me fell down because people began pushing. The whole environment 
and atmosphere of the concert became really uncomfortable, so my friend 
and I decided to leave. Even though my Carnival Concert experience wasn’t 
ideal, at least I was introduced to some new good music; Wale’s performance 
and songs definitely made up for everything else.

C# Carnival Concert: Fantastic World of Film
written by Izzy Sio | Pillbox Editor 
photos by Tracy Le | Visual Editor
Acapella group the C# Singers held their Carnival Concert in 
Doherty Hall 2315 last Thursday. This year, the theme of their con-
cert was the “Fantastic World of Film,” and the group, alongside 
their Db Singers choir, performed songs such as Blue Suede’s 
“Hooked on a Feeling” — recently made popular by Guardians of 
the Galaxy — and a medley of Shrek hits such as Smash Mouth’s 
“All Star” and Counting Crows’ “Accidentally In Love.”
