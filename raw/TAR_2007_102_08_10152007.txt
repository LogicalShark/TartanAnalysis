One year after the final plans for Car­
negie Mellon’s new computer science 
complex were unveiled, construction 
continues. The complex will eventually 
hold the Gates Center and its accompa­
nying, still-unnamed research building 
in the area between Newell-Simon Hall 
and the Purnell Center for the Arts.
Currently, concrete walls are going 
up for the complex’s underground, 150-
car garage, which can be viewed from 
Purnell.
This is the first step of the project; the 
entire complex is expected to be com­
pleted in 2009.
The project is completely on sched­
ule, said Ralph Horgan, associate 
vice-provost of campus design and facil­
ity development.
“The next step after the construction 
of the concrete garage will be steel go­
ing up around February,” Horgan said. 
This means that construction will move 
from foundational elements to the actual 
structure of the buildings.
‘Construction on the building should 
have begun last January; however, the 
university was unable to sign a construc­
tion team until March because of rising 
budget costs, said Guy Blelloch, associ­
ate dean for planning in the School of 
Computer Science.
The price increase in steel and concrete, 
along with some structural changes that 
were made to the design increased con­
struction costs, Blelloch said.
Rather than alter the construction 
plan to fit the existing budget, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Board of Trustees approved a 10 
ercent increase in the project’s budget.
This translated into an additional $9 mil­
lion in funds, which ensured that crews 
could begin construction, and the uni­
versity signed a construction company 
several months ago.
Even so, Horgan says the project is on 
schedule.
“We have maintained our goals,” he 
said of the budget changes.
Blelloch and Horgan said almost noth­
ing has been done to alter the design of 
the complex.
The complex has also been designed 
to be environmentally progressive. The 
university plans to seek Silver Leadership

Governor Rendell 
speaks on health care

Today is the culmination of 
salsa lessons, siestas, Latin film 
festivals, and Spanish posters 
on campus, otherwise known 
as Hispanic Heritage Month at 
Carnegie Mellon. The annual 
30-day celebration, which ran 
this year from Sept. 15 to Oct. 
15, featured lectures, late-night 
activities, movie screenings, 
and a service fair with the His­
panic community of Pittsburgh.
The events highlighted the 
Hispanic organizations on cam­
pus, especially the Spanish and 
Latin American Student Associ­
ation (SALSA), Latin American 
Business Association, and
National Society of Hispanic 
Engineers (NSHE).
Several other organizations 
helped with the month, includ­
ing the Multicultural Presidents’ 
Council (MPC). The group is a 
collaboration of cultural orga­
nizations that works together 
to present a cohesive stand on 
diversity on campus and to 
promote events such as those 
held during Hispanic Heritage 
Month.
Intended to raise awareness of 
Hispanic culture in the Carnegie 
Mellon community and beyond, 
organizers of the month’s events 
aimed to facilitate a connection 
between students and different 
facets of Hispanic culture that 
students could take with them 
beyond University Center walls.
“Hispanic Heritage Month 
is not just food, music, and 
dancing,” said M. Shernell 
Smith, coordinator of Student
Activities and member of the 
planning committee for this 
year’s event. “It’s about a cele­
bration of culture, an awareness 
of Pittsburgh’s Hispanic popu­
lation, and a highlighting of 
student groups on campus.”
Events were scheduled for 
nearly every day of the month.
On Sept. 23, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted A1 Servicio de la Comu- 
nidad 2007, a service fair for 
Pittsburgh’s Hispanic popula­
tion. The fair, held in Rangos 
Hall, brought together over 100 
exhibitors and almost 1000 at­
tendees, including Pittsburgh 
residents and Carnegie Mellon 
students, faculty, and staff.
The service organizations 
presented Pittsburgh’s Hispanic 
population with information 
on how to buy a house, get a 
driver’s license, open a bank ac­
count, and access health care 
and other social services.
Students specializing in His­
panic studies in the department 
of modern languages had the 
opportunity to act as interpret­
ers during the fair to ensure that 
English and non-English speak­
ing attendees fully understood 
what was going on.
Spanish signs were placed on 
campus directing the attendees 
to Rangos Hall, and music and 
Latin food were provided.
“I didn’t really know what to
Courtesy of the University of Florida
think when I saw so many Span­
ish signs around campus that 
weekend,” said Joel Weiss, a 
junior economics major. “But I 
think it’s awesome that we were 
doing something so directly re­
lated to the city where we live.”
Some of the events were 
intended only for students. 
Organizers hoped to familiar­
ize them with Hispanic culture 
through fun, informal cultural 
experiences.
During Hispanic Culture Day 
on Oct. 6, a group of Hispanic 
students gathered in the Connan 
Room. Surrounded by free food, 
a live band, and Latin American 
crafts, non-Hispanic students 
had the chance to interact with 
the student organizations.
This event took place in the 
mid-afternoon, at the typical 
time of a Spanish siesta.
Speak Your Mind, held on 
Oct. 9 in the University Cen­
ter, integrated Hispanic culture 
with music.
The key lecture, titled, “From 
Hip-Hop & Techno to Salsa, 
Rock or Jazz: What can your 
music do?” was led by Carnegie 
Mellon Hispanic studies profes­
sor Felipe Gomez and facilitated 
by two of his students.

As the total number 
of uninsured adults 
in Pennsylvania hits 
767,000, with a total of 
108,835 in Allegheny County 
alone, Governor Edward 
Rendell arrived in Pitts­
burgh just in time to 
discuss health insurance 
policies at a town hall 
meeting last Tuesday.
The meeting was held in 
the Kauffman Auditorium at 
Hill House Association. Ren­
dell discussed the soaring 
prices of health insurance, 
which often discourage indi­
viduals from purchasing and 
businesses from providing basic 
health care. Rendell encouraged 
fellow Pennsylvanians to sup­
port Cover All Pennsylvanians 
(CAP), his proposal to the fed­
eral government that provides 
health insurance to every Penn­
sylvania resident who needs it.
“Employees and small busi­
nesses are unable to keep up 
with health care inflation, which 
is resulting in more and more 
uninsured individuals,” Rendell 
said.
Moreover, he added, part-time 
employees do not receive health 
insurance. The CAP program 
will ensure that each individual 
citizen can buy health insurance 
at a limited price, regardless of 
his or her employer, wages, or 
hours worked.
“We assessed that if this 
situation persists for the next 
seven years, health insurance 
will disappear in the state of 
Pennsylvania,” Rendell said.
Director of Student Health 
Services Anita Barkin sup­
ported Rendell’s proposal but 
was unsure how the program, if 
implemented, would affect Car­
negie Mellon students.
“In principle, I agree with 
the governor’s position that all 
Pennsylvanians should have ac­
cess to health care providers and 
that we need to have a program
that better addresses issues of 
chronic diseases and health eq­
uity issues. Whether this will 
affect the health care insur­
ance status of Carnegie Mellon 
students depends on a number 
of aspects of the proposal,” she 
said. Barkin also had a number 
of concerns about the program.
“Firstly, the current student 
insurance plan through High- 
mark is benefit-rich and low-cost 
when compared to other plans 
on the market. I’m not sure a 
student can do better with an in­
dividual plan through a private 
insurer given that usually group 
plans can command a lower 
price with better benefits. Also, 
would out-of-state students 
even be considered eligible to 
purchase through the CAP pro­
gram?” Barkin said.
Pittsburgh was Rendell’s sec­
ond of nine stops on a statewide 
bus tour to boost awareness of 
health care inflation faced by 
the state and gain support for his 
proposal, the Philadelphia Busi­
ness Journal reported Oct. 4.
Rendell was accompanied by 
State Senator Jay Costa, State 
Representative Mike Surla, and 
Director of the Governor’s Office 
of Health Care Reform Rose­
mary Greco.
“Family health insurance pre­
miums have increased by 75.6 
percent in the last seven years, at 
the rate of more than 10 percent 
a year,” Rendell said. During 
this period of time, he added, in­
flation increased by 17 percent, 
while median wages increased 
by 13.3 percent. Consequently, 
health insurance costs are out­
stripping profits reaped by busi­
nesses and wages earned by 
employees.
Rendell remained confident 
that the CAP program-would be 
able to provide for Pennsylva­
nia’s most pressing health care 
needs.
“Unless something happens 
on the federal front, we can 
insure at least all children by 
2009,” said Rendell.

Diverse
faculty
sparse
by Mariluz Orbay
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon’s minority 
faculty members compose only 
13 percent of the university’s 
total faculty population, ac­
cording to this year’s fall staff 
survey by the U.S. Department 
of Education, which was pub­
lished in the Chronicle of Higher 
Education Oct. 8. This puts 
Carnegie Mellon in the below- 
average range for percentage of 
minority faculty at colleges and 
universities in all 50 states and 
Washington, D.C.
“The importance of minority 
faculty is the same as the impor­
tance to Carnegie Mellon of all 
aspects of its diversity — they 
make us better,” Carnegie Mel­
lon President Jared L. Cohon 
stated via e-mail. “Beyond the 
general value of diversity, mi­
nority faculty also serve as role 
models for minority students.
“Carnegie Mellon is compa­
rable to its peers in terms of the 
percentage of its faculty who 
are minorities, but the numbers 
are low — too low — despite a 
significant increase over the last 
several years. Increasing the di­
versity of our faculty remains a 
high priority,” he continued.
In 2000, Cohon created the 
Diversity Advisory Council, 
comprised of students, faculty, 
staff, administrators, trustees, 
and external community lead­
ers. The council has focused 
on identifying diversity is­
sues, building awareness, and 
supporting the university’s 
initiatives.
However, increasing diver­
sity at the university has proven 
to be a more difficult task than 
anticipated.
“Our efforts are complicated 
by pipeline issues such as in­
stitutions competing for a very 
small pool of minority Ph.D.s, 
especially the academic ‘stars.’ ” 
said Everett Tademy, assistant 
vice president of the Diversity 
Advisory Council.
Departmental strategies and 
sensitivity training programs 
for faculty are a couple of the 
recommendations being de­
veloped and practiced by the 
council to increase diversity on 
campus.
“I believe that our university 
is committed to thorough and 
aggressive searches for faculty 
and that in recent years, par­
ticularly coinciding with Dr. 
Cohon’s presidency, these ef­
forts have led to positive results 
[in terms of] both minority and 
women faculty hires,” Tademy 
said. “Yes, much more needs 
to be done, but I see university 
leadership, particularly our col­
lege and school deans, insisting 
on results and holding depart­
ment heads and academic 
administrators accountable for 
improving both minority and 
women participation in the re­
cruitment pool.”
The council’s goals for this year 
include increasing the presence 
of minorities in administrative 
and upper-level staff positions 
and closely watching the minor­
ity undergraduate enrollment, 
according to the council’s most 
recent report. Universities that 
rank in the first quartile for mi­
nority representation have at 
least 35 percent more minority 
faculty than Carnegie Mellon, 
the report noted.
Students said that there 
were both advantages and 
disadvantages to increasing

Tree’ bus fares increase; art and tech intersect
CMU, Pitt to shell out for busing
Students’ “free” bus rides are about 
to get more expensive.
Since the late 1990s, Carnegie Mellon 
and the University of Pittsburgh have 
had an agreement with Port Authority 
that allows the universities to pay a dis­
counted rate for busing for all students 
and faculty. This payment is partially 
funded by students’ tuition payments. 
The arrangement entitles students 
and faculty members to unlimited bus 
transportation when they flash their 
IDs upon boarding or exiting a bus.
The contract for this agreement ex­
pired on July 31 and was extended 
through September with a 15 per­
cent price increase. On Sept. 21, Port 
Authority officials proposed a five-year 
plan to offer continued discounted bus 
transportation to both schools, but at a 
15 percent increase per year.
At present, Carnegie Mellon pays
$881,000 per year for the service; Pitt 
pays $2.9 million. In 2012, the last year 
of the proposed agreement, Carnegie 
Mellon will pay $1.5 million and Pitt 
will pay $6.8 million.
Carnegie Mellon currently has 13,000 
students and faculty; Pitt has 38,000.
“We’ve understood for some time 
that there would need to be an adjust­
ment to bring our costs in closer line 
with the average fare,” said Michael 
Murphy, associate vice president of 
Carnegie Mellon, in a Sept. 22 article in 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette.
Students are worried that the agree­
ment will cause a tuition increase.
“We will need to pass on some por­
tion of the increase to students, though 
we’ll be able to offset that a bit because 
we have a reserve that will allow us to 
soften that increase for the next few 
years,” Murphy said.
University holds Art/Tech summit
On Friday and Saturday, Carnegie 
Mellon’s Center for Arts Management 
and Technology hosted the Technology 
in the Arts Conference. The event 
brought together 200 arts leaders from 
all over the world to discuss how art 
is using technology in various dimen­
sions, including expression, marketing, 
administration, audience development, 
and donor relations.
Jake Barton, founder of the design 
firm Local Projects, gave the keynote 
address. Barton discussed the use of 
media and participatory media by mu­
seums and other organizations to attract 
their audience’s attention and improve 
their audience’s overall experience. He 
mentioned the Carousel at Battery Park 
in New York City, which incorporates ar­
chitecture, music, design, and art along 
with an aquarium theme to encourage 
people to visit the New York Aquarium.
Local Projects is currently designing 
the National September 11 Memorial 
and Museum at the site of the former 
World Trade Center. The firm also 
works with the Tribeca Film Festival, the 
National Museum of American Jewish 
History, the Cooper-Hewitt National 
Design Museum, and the Grand Central 
Terminal.
The conference also featured vari­
ous lectures by experts on topics such 
as interdisciplinary work between arts 
and technology experts, digital imaging, 
virtual reality and copyrighting, accord­
ing to an Oct. 9 university press release. 
Discussions covered new media such as 
podcasts, and the latest introductions to 
the Internet, such as RSS feeds.

Professor Dennis Abelson dies at 56Gates center gets bigger budget
VanTimmeren recalled visiting 
him in the hospital.
“He had a positive attitude even 
in the hospital,” she said. “He was 
asking how we were doing and if 
we had met the new French horn 
student.”
Often going above and beyond 
the call of duty as a professor, 
Abelson once took VanTimme­
ren to get her horn mouthpiece 
repaired. f
“He was honestly more like a 
friend to me,” she said. “He loved 
music and his students. He was 
very humble, kind, and caring.” 
Throughout his extraordinary 
career as an educator, performer, 
and artist, Abelson effortlessly 
inspired his students not only 
through his actions and encour­
agement, but in his advice and 
reassurance. To Bosler he said, 
“You’re going to be fíne, just prac­
tice.” And to VanTimmeren he 
advised, “You just can’t worry 
about what other people think.” 
Dennis Abelson is survived by 
his wife, Lu Ann Cowan Abel­
son, his daughter Elizabeth Ann, 
and his brother Michael Alan of 
Banksville, Pa.
The School of Music held a 
memorial service in honor of 
Abelson Thursday.
GATES, from A1

the complex from the U.S. Green 
Building Council, according to an 
Oct. 12 university press release.
Another important develop­
ment in the project is naming 
the bridge that will connect the 
Purnell Center for the Arts to
the Gates Center portion of the 
SCS complex. The bridge will be 
named after computer science 
professor Randy Pausch, which 
Cohon announced following 
Pausch’s lecture in McConomy 
Auditorium on Sept. 18.
Pausch is the co-founder of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC), which 
works jointly with the College of
Fine Arts and the School of Com­
puter Science to offer a two-year 
master’s program in entertain­
ment technology.
The bridge will be symbolic of 
the way in which the ETC pro­
gram melds the disciplines of art 
and technology, Horgan said.
“[The complex] will add tre­
mendously to the campus,” 
Horgan said.
Campus lacks minority faculty

Junior Staffwriter
On September 1, Carnegie 
Mellon music professor Dennis 
Abelson passed away at UPMC 
Shadyside. He was 56 years old.
The cause was cancer.
For 16 years, Abelson was 
professor of horn in the School 
of Music at Carnegie Mellon, 
specializing in French horn. He 
was head of the Abelson Horn 
Studio within the School of Mu­
sic, which prepared students 
for professional careers as horn 
players. The studio provided rig­
orous lessons and access to horn 
ensemble groups, chamber mu­
sic, and off-campus performance 
venues.
Abelson began playing the 
French horn in elementary 
school. He went on to play in 
the orchestra while a student at 
Taylor Allderdice High School in 
Squirrel Hill.
Abelson earned his bachelor’s 
degree in music at Duquesne Uni­
versity. He joined the Carnegie 
Mellon faculty in 1991.
Abelson’s musical pursuits 
were not confined to the class­
room. He performed with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orches­
tra, the Mendelssohn and Bach 
choirs, the Civic Light Opera, the 
Chicago Ballet, and the Grand 
Teton Orchestra.
In addition to his rich back­
ground and experience in music, 
Abelson’s most enduring contri­
bution to the arts was the sincere, 
wholehearted encouragement he 
provided to his students.
. “Abelson was a fine musician,
. but particularly dedicated to his 
, students. He was able to relate to 
them in an individual way,” said 
Natalie Ozeas, associate head of 
the School of Music.
Through his work at Abelson 
Horn Studio, he provided an en­
vironment where horn students 
could hone their talents.
“He made the studio feel like 
a home away from home,” said 
former student Annie Bosler, 
who graduated in 2003. Bosler 
is currently pursuing her Ph.D. in 
music at the University of South­
ern California.
Abelson played a significant , 
role in Bosler’s career. She came to
Carnegie Mellon as a double ma­
jor in math and music. However, 
“After talking with Mr. Abelson I 
decided to switch over to music,” 
she said. “It was the best decision 
of my life.”
Abelson exhibited a dedication 
to teaching and the musical arts.
“He was always looking to help 
his students out,” said Bosler. 
Abelson would often stay after 
class on his own time to work 
with students, she said.
Like Bosler, Abelson enjoyed 
playing tennis, and the two 
sometimes played together. On 
the tennis courts, the teacher and 
student would switch — Abelson 
often welcomed tips from Bosler 
on his tennis game, especially on 
his backhand.
Such were the unique relation­
ships that Abelson developed 
with several of his students.
“He made each of us feel spe­
cial and good about ourselves 
and how we played,” said Melissa 
VanTimmeren, a senior French 
horn major.
Abelson also inspired his stu­
dents with his upbeat perspective 
on life in general.
“He was always good at mak­
ing a joke and finding the humor 
in life,” VanTimmeren said.
DIVERSITY, from A1
diversity on campus. While ac­
knowledging the university’s 
need to increase faculty and staff 
diversity, first-year mathematics 
major Ashish Babaria explained 
what he believed to be draw­
backs of being taught by minority 
faculty.
“The issue with minority fac­
ulty at CMU is that, at times, 
when students are being taught 
by minority professors and TAs, 
they tend to experience diffi­
culty trying to understand due 
to difference in cultural and geo­
graphical factors that may result 
in variations in forms of commu­
nication,” Babaria said.
Other students, such as 
first-year history major Nick 
Sciannameo, recognize the 
advantages such diversity brings.
“Diversity amongst the fac­
ulty generally offers diversity of 
viewpoints, which consecutively 
makes way for more worldly edu­
cation,” Sciannameo said.

/ Pittsburgh 2007
Governor Rendell spoke in Pittsburgh on the Pa. CAP health care system he hopes to initiate as a state wide program for 
both Pittsburgh residents and college students. It still awaits approval from the federal government.
RENDELL, from Al
He pointed out that other states, 
such as Massachusetts and California, 
are already implementing policies to 
ensure the health and well-being of 
their populace.
The legislation will also require 
that each hospital in Pennsylvania 
has an emergency section, along 
with a 24/7 non-emergency section. 
Rendell also addressed the need for 
improvements in the quality of health 
care, such as lowering the risks of 
hospital-acquired infections.
“Eighty percent of the costs 
incurred at hospitals are a result 
of patients affected by chronic dis­
eases, mostly hospital-acquired 
infections. In 2005, a total of 2000 
people were"- reported dead due to
hospital-acquired infections. In 
addition to the cost of lives, the hos­
pital incurred a cost of $3.5 billion on 
the system,” said Rendell.
The CAP health care package cov­
ers long-term living services for 
elderly or disabled citizens and the 
costs of prescription drugs.
Rendell said that, if sanctioned, his 
proposal will cause a tax raise in Penn­
sylvania. Nevertheless, this tax will 
be imposed on health-deteriorating 
products such as tobacco, smokeless 
tobacco, and alcohol. A tax of 5 per­
cent will be imposed on businesses 
that do not provide health care to their 
full-time or part-time employers.
“Spending a small amount of money 
up front, we will save suffering pa­
tients in the future,” said Rendell.
With regard to university health
care insurance policies, the governor 
said that every university in Pennsyl­
vania will be encouraged to require 
students enrolled in undergraduate 
and graduate programs to purchase 
CAP. Also, Rendell plans to propose 
legislation which permits parents to 
be their child’s legal guardians until 
their children reach the age of 30 to 
enable them to provide continued 
affordable health care for their chil­
dren. Self-employed individuals can 
buy CAP independently at a cost of 
$280 for themselves and their fami­
lies. However, singles are charged 
$500 to $600.
The final effect of Rendell’s pro­
gram at Carnegie Mellon and 
elsewhere will depend on approval 
from the federal government.

Hispanic Heritage Month
inspires cultural awareness
HERITAGE, fromAl
America and the world of music there, 
and how he brought it with him to the 
United States.
“This event was an infusion of cul­
ture and language through music,” said 
Smith. “I think the message really got 
across to the students.”
Noche Latina, the late-night event held 
on Sept. 18, was another program that 
used music to get across its message.
Sponsored by SALSA and the SMARC, 
the event included a live salsa band and 
dancing lessons, complete with Latin 
food.
“I thought the Noche Latina late-night 
was awesome,” said Alexa Beaver, a 
sophomore chemical engineering and 
Hispanic studies double major. “I mean, 
who wouldn’t want to dance and listen to 
salsa for a night?”
Noche Latina’s salsa dancing was just 
one of the many events that immersed 
students in Hispanic culture.
However, events held last week were 
attended by fewer people in comparison
to events held earlier in the month. Mid­
terms and large amounts of work before 
mid-semester break may have been the 
cause of the uncharacteristic absentee­
ism, Smith said.
Despite the smaller turnout, Smith 
said, the event’s organizers remained 
optimistic and very happy with the way 
the month turned out.
“We were able to bring in some po­
litically charged speakers, integrate the 
Pittsburgh community, and get a really 
great reaction from our students,” Smith 
said.
As this year’s event comes to an end, 
the Office of Student Activities is already ; 
planning for next year’s celebration.
However, the end of Hispanic Heritage 
Month should not be the end of celebrat­
ing Hispanic heritage, Smith empha­
sized.
“Hispanic Heritage Month is not some­
thing that should be taken as a 30-day 
event,” Smith said. “Celebration of one’s 
culture, whether it be Hispanic, Asian, 
African-American, or any other people' 
is really a 365-day event.”
These events arc hosted by the four Pittsburgh Carnegie Organizations: Carnegie Hero Fund Commission, 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh, Carnegie Mellon University and Carnegie Museums of Pittsburgh.

The U.S. Transportation Se­

Barry Steinhardt, director

Storage regulations

The Environmental Protec­

specific rules governing how 
coal-fired power plants and 
other industrial facilities store 
carbon dioxide waste in under­
ground reservoirs.
This method is not commer­
cially available yet, but it is a 
popular proposal for slowing 
down the harmful, drastic ef­
fects of global warming on 
Earth’s climate.
Power plants that burn fossil 
fuels, such as coal, are heavy 
carbon dioxide emitters. One 
third of emissions in the U.S. 
come from power plants and 
large industrial sources. It is 
estimated that the U.S. and 
Canada retain enough storage 
capacity to store greenhouse 
gas from power plants for 900

Marrying a robot

of sex and marriage.
Levy’s thesis, “Intimate Re­

that it is virtually possible to 
program a robot so that it ex­
hibits sexual affection toward 
humans and engages in inti­
mate discourse with them.
There are a number of rea­

When R. Ravi, the Carnegie

Research and Computer Sci­
ence, assembled a conference, 
“Hurdles to e-Business,” this 
month, he decided to focus on 
the problems in a field many 
perceive as prodigious, limit­
less, and flawless.
The conference was held last 
Thursday morning in McCo- 
nomy Auditorium. At specific 
times throughout the morning, 
speakers from three of the big­
gest names in e-Business gave 
presentations about the obsta­
cles that their companies face.
In his keynote address, Ravi 
explained that it is prescient 
to be aware of the “difficulties 
[these businesses face] in de­
ploying different services and 
applications,” referring to the 
hurdles that keep these influen­
tial businesses from operating 
at an optimal level.
Neel Sundaresan, senior di­
rector and head of research labs 
at eBay, opened his presenta­
tion about a website called The 
Ultimate Rejection Letter.
The website consists of a letter 
written by a “Chris L. Jensen” in 
response to a rejection letter he 
received for a job application. 
Like many sites on the Internet, 
it is a useless but humorous di­
version usually stumbled upon 
serendipitously.
Sundaresan then drew the 
audience’s attention to a web­
site with various world flags. 
The Brazilian artist who de­
signed the site had correlated 
the colors on every world flag to 
statistics about the country.
For the Brazilian flag, the

centage of people living on less

Thanks to the work of nearly 100 as­
tronomers from all over the world, known 
collectively as All-Wavelength Extended 
Groth Strip International Survey (AEGIS), 
computer users can view galaxies and 
star formations that date back nine billion 
years.
Five AEGIS teams compiled galactic im­
ages that can now be viewed on Google Sky. 
Marc Davis of the University of California, 
Berkeley and Sandra Faber of the 
University of Califor­
nia, Santa Cruz led
one of these teams, called Deep Extragalac- 
tic Evolutionary Probe (DEEP2) Redshift 
Survey.
Jeffrey Newman, assistant professor of 
physics and astronomy at the University of 
Pittsburgh, was Davis’s “right-hand man” 
on the DEEP2 Redshift Survey team.
Researchers examined a strip of sky, 
namely the Extended Groth Strip Field, in 
numerous wavelengths of electromagnetic 
radiation, including X-rays, in­
frared, ultraviolet, vis­
ible, and radio waves.
These various wavelengths allowed re­
searchers to study the origin and formation 
of stars.
The data from these electromagnetic 
waves was then used to create a collection 
of images that can be viewed on Google

Psychologist David Klahr named Bingham Professor
by Eugene Kang
Junior Staffwriter
After years of having an ef­
fect on Carnegie Mellon and 
other institutions, David Klahr, 
a researcher in education, has 
received the prestigious title of 
Walter van Dyke Bingham Pro­
fessor of Cognitive Development 
and Education Sciences from 
Carnegie Mellon University.
Klahr’s accomplishments 
include the investigations of sci-
entific discovery and cognitive 
development. Klahr has written 
several papers addressing these 
topics, each one recognized by 
esteemed publications, including 
the British Journal of Psychology 
and the International Journal of 
Man-Machine Studies.
Michael Scheier, head of 
Carnegie Mellon’s psychology 
department, said that there are 
two characteristics that dis­
tinguish Klahr as an education 
researcher.
“The first is the quality of his
research. Put simply, David is a 
first-class scientist and theore­
tician, who [has done] some of 
the most interesting work on the 
nature of scientific reasoning. 
The second characteristic is that 
David is determined to have the 
seeds of his work find its way into 
educational practice and policy. 
He is very committed to seeing 
that scientific findings get trans­
lated into real-world classroom 
settings.”
Klahr graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon with a master’s degree in
1965 and a doctoral degree from 
the Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration (Tepper School 
of Business) in 1968.
Prior to teaching at Carn­

As Buggy moves into the 21st 
century, this tradition rich in en­
gineering and athletic excellence 
increasingly highlights cutting- 
edge technological innovations 
in science and engineering.
Racing a buggy involves three 
basic elements: mechanics, driv­
ers, and pushers. Each buggy 
organization, of which there 
are currently 12 on campus, 
has a team of mechanics that is 
responsible for building, main­
taining, and preparing its buggy 
for weekly practices and the race 
day in April.
However, in order to under­
stand how Buggy works, and 
what makes for differing levels 
of competition among teams, 
it’s important to first understand 
what makes all buggies roll 
through the course.
Buggies can only be propelled 
by pushers (on the uphill por­
tions of the course) and gravity 
(via the downhill “free roll” por­
tion of the course). The buggies 
are maneuvered by drivers, who 
are members of the Carnegie 
Mellon community who are usu­
ally around five feet tall.
According to the Sweep­
stakes website (andrew.cmu.
edu/~buggy), the racing vehi­
cles cannot have any means of 
internal propulsion. This means 
that the vehicles cannot have 
any device “whose purpose is 
to store energy independent of 
the speed of the buggy (such as a 
geared flywheel) or whose pur­
pose is to increase the forward 
speed of that buggy by adding 
kinetic energy.”
Teams interpret and
implement mechanical sys­
tems differently, and this leads 
to changing levels of overall 
competitiveness and buggy team 
hierarchies.
While every organization has 
its own means of getting its
also be self-resetting, meaning 
that they must release braking 
power when a driver stops ac­
tuating them, and they must be 
equipped with locking devices.
The wheel technology of 
a buggy is almost as para­
mount to a team’s success as the 
rest of buggy technology as a 
whole.
According to buggy guide­
lines, three wheels must be in 
contact with the road surface at 
all times.
Wheels can be pneumatic 
tires, which are inflated before 
rolling like bike tires, rubber 
tires, or polyurethane tires. The 
different types of tires are be­
lieved to alter the smoothness of 
the course or speed of the buggy 
in various ways, many of which 
are specific to and kept secret by 
individual teams.
Drivers are the members of 
buggy teams that can make or 
break a race based on their driv­
ing accuracy and adherence to 
the team’s line, or desired path 
through the course.
Drivers enter the buggy by 
top or front hatches, or by the 
removal of the shell in its en­
tirety from the base section of 
the buggy.
To keep drivers safe, they 
must be connected via a harness 
with D-ring carabiners (like 
those used when rock climbing) 
by a minimum of three different 
points to structural members of 
the buggy. This ensures that the 
driver’s movement is restricted 
in all directions in the event of 
an accident.
In addition to their harnesses, 
these team drivers are protected 
while driving by a required hel­
met, goggles, and gloves.
In incorporating such state-of- 
the-art, revolutionary materials, 
such as incredibly high strength- 
to-weight composites, Buggy 
continues to be just as trend-set­
ting, technologically innovative, 
and unique as it was during its 
inception in 1920.
How Things Work: Buggy
j.w. Kamp/rnoto tanor
The success of a buggy vehicle depends upon various mechanical systems, including brakes, steering and wheels, 
buggy through the course in steering systems can be as di- twists, turns, and potholes with-
the quickest and most efficient 
way possible, there are standard 
parts to every buggy.
First, the outer cover, or 
“shell,” of a buggy — that which 
is seen from the outside and 
gives a buggy its general shape 
— is most commonly made of 
composite materials (fiberglass 
or carbon fiber), or in certain in­
stances, metal frames.
The shell cannot exceed 15 
feet in length or six feet in width. 
The shell must also be structur­
ally sound to protect the driver 
inside.
All in all, the shell must be 
able to support a weight of 408 
pounds.
While all buggy shells have 
standard dimensions, the buggy
verse as buggies themselves.
Steering systems are con­
trolled by the driver and not by 
the pusher or pushbar. The driver 
steers as she or he stretches her 
or his arms forward like Super­
man while laying on his or her 
stomach, holding on to some 
sort of handlebar that pivots left 
and right.
Some steering systems con­
trol a single front wheel, such 
as in a standard “trike” system 
with one wheel in front and two 
in back, or two front wheels and 
one back wheel in the case of a 
reverse trike system.
The ideal steering system is 
one that limits too much shak­
ing, allowing the driver to easily 
maneuver through the course’s
out losing control of the system.
The art of creating an efficient 
buggy braking mechanism, on 
the other hand, is one plagued 
by such troubles as brakes being 
too loose, rubbing the ground or 
wheel while the buggy is mov­
ing, and not releasing enough 
to give wheels sufficient room to 
turn properly.
Some teams’ buggies main­
tain brakes that stop the buggy 
by pressing against the ground 
(“drop brakes”), while other 
teams use brake systems that 
stop the buggy by braking 
against the wheel itself.
According to Sweepstakes 
rules, brakes must be “capable 
of stopping the rolling motion 
of [a] buggy.” The brakes must

“Usually, when you go on the 
Internet, you go looking for stuff. 
But at the same time, I never 
went looking for the site with the 
ultimate rejection letter, or the 
site with the flags. And that de­
fines the person that comes to a 
site like eBay. They come looking 
for stuff, but they never end up 
looking at what they came look­
ing for,” Sundaresan said.
einns rt]SSSSSSiSIrSS]S] •SÍÌ
Neel Sundaresan spoke about eBay.
Unlike other enormous search 
engines, which operate on rel­
evance, eBay’s search engines 
strive to surprise the user by de­
livering the unexpected.
“Many times,” Sundaresan 
said, “users end up looking for 
things they don’t even know 
they’re looking for. And that’s a 
complication. One of our biggest 
challenges is to quantify and 
characterize serendipity.”
Another issue that eBay faces 
is the search query itself.
“A number of users are not sure 
how to spell Britney Spears ... 
or whether ‘sherbert’ is spelled 
with an ‘r’ or without one,” Sun­
daresan said, pulling up a slide 
with search variants for Sherbert 
Bunny Webkinz, a plush stuffed 
animal that comes with a unique 
code that allows access to an 
online “Webkinz World” where 
they can “adopt” their pet.
Later in the morning, the Pow­
erPoint screen switched from 
eBay to another colorful logo, 
Google.
Kourosh Gharachorloo, a 
former senior technical staff 
member at Western Research 
Laboratory, is part of Google’s 
traffic quality team. Gharac­
horloo focuses his efforts on 
cleaning up ad traffic, a signifi­
cant portion of which involves 
click fraud and payment fraud.
Gharachorloo segued into a 
detailed explanation of click
fraud, whereby a user (auto­
mated or otherwise) clicks on 
an ad without any interest in the 
product, generating a charge per 
click. Click fraud significantly 
hurts all parties, driving down 
the clickstream’s value and forc­
ing the marketer to lower his or 
her bid on the ad space.
A Google search for digital 
cameras, for example, will bring 
up a slew of advertisements.
“An advertiser will provide us 
with a maximum bid. The adver­
tiser will say, ‘I want to show my

“We have to figure out what 
the value of this ad is to Google. 
Of course, an advertiser can of­

If people or computers con­

any intention of buying products

1983 for the next 10 years.
Klahr is currently a fellow of 
the American Psychological As­
sociation and the Association 
for Psychological Science. In ad­
dition, Klahr is a member of the 
governing board for the Cogni­
tive Development Society.
Klahr’s contributions to these 
organizations include input 
from his own publications
For instance, Klahr contrib­
uted evidence fromhis controlled 
studies to “Consumerism: Mar­
keting, Buying, and American 
Psyche,” a publication from the 
American Psychological Asso­
ciation. In the publication, Klahr 
proposed that direct instruction 
is more effective than discovery 
instruction.
Klahr’s proposition basically 
states that students are better in­
formed when material is taught 
directly to them, rather than 
have them discover material on 
their own through research and 
experimentation.
“I hope to be able to continue 
to contribute to educational re­
search efforts,” Klahr said, “both 
in programs at CMU, such as 
PIER [Program of Interdisciplin­
ary Educational Research] and
the PSLC [Pittsburgh Science 
of Learning Center], as well as 
serving on national committees 
that are involved with improving 
education, such as the National 
Academy of Education, and the 
National Research Council.”
PIER is a program within 
Carnegie Mellon that teaches 
scientists how to conduct re­
search that is required for 
practicing education. Klahr di­
rects this program, personally 
assisting students in conducting 
research as well as submitting his 
own work to PIER for improve­
ments on their methodology.
PSLC, on the other hand, is an 
institution in which researchers 
conduct experiments that inves­
tigate learning. The institution 
holds a variety of resources, in­
cluding online course author­
ship and learning curve analysis 
software.
Klahr’s most recent study per­
tains to the cognitive process 
that supports children’s scien­
tific thinking. Klahr strives to 
improve the teaching of experi­
mental science.
“My research is aimed at un­
derstanding the most effective 
ways to teach elementary school 
children how to design experi­
ments,” Klahr said.

Klahr said that he views his i 
research as a contribution to the 
education of many grade levels 
in a variety of ways.
Klahr said, “First, the topic 
is a central part of the science 
curriculum, and anything that 
improves kids’ understanding 
of how to ‘do science’ is valu­
able. Second, I try very hard 
to make sure that any claims 
made about effective instruct 
tion are supported by rigori

all too common in education.”-

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 15, 2007
Researchers strive to understand the origin and purpose of galaxies
GALAXY, from A5
images feature 100 million gal­
axies and 200 million stars. The 
images allow users to view the 
galaxies in X-ray, ultraviolet, and 
infrared light.
A combination of telescopes 
and photographic devices made 
these images possible.
As stated on the AEGIS web­
site, the equipment includes 
X-ray imaging in Chandra’s 
X-ray laboratory, the Hubble 
telescope and its main imaging 
camera, Advanced Camera for 
Surveys (ACS), and the Galaxy 
Evolution Explorer (GALEX) 
space telescope.
Put together, the images ob­
tained from these instruments 
provide detailed pictures of the 
galaxies.
Newman’s team used the Keck 
telescopes in combination with 
the DEIMOS spectrograph to 
study galaxies.
The Keck telescopes are large 
telescopes used for optical 
and infrared astronomy, while 
DEIMOS is a spectroscope on the 
Keck telescope that photographs 
the spectra.
Newman said that by ob­
serving just a patch of sky, 
astronomers can understand that 
historically, evolution of the gal­
axies took place at a much faster
rate than it does now.
Newman said, “Our survey 
showed that the information we 
used to measure distances to the 
galaxies can also be used to see 
how stars form. We noticed that 
the universe eight billion years 
ago did not look too different 
than what it does today; the dis­
tribution of the galaxies is quite 
similar to what it was after the 
Big Bang.”
Newman’s group was also able 
to detect the energy release, ra­
diation, and future development 
of stars within the galaxy.
Faber, who worked with New­
man in DEEP2, said that there 
are two fundamental parts to the
mystery of the galaxies.
“Firstly, where do galaxies 
come from, and secondly, why do 
they exist?” Faber said.
Faber also said that while Hub­
ble projects sharp and vibrant 
images, the images are futile on 
their own. !
“Along with Keck, we need 
DEIMOS spectrograph to sort 
these images out in terms of dis­
tance and time. Ground-based 
telescopes do not produce clear 
images. Keck, on the other hand, 
is very powerful, as it is up in the 
atmosphere,” Faber said.
According to the AEGIS web­
site, DEEP2 had two phases.
The first phase involved the
observation of a sample of about 
1000 galaxies in the Extended 
Groth Strip. The second phase 
involved using the DEIMOS 
spectrograph to view spectra of
50.000 galaxies up to nine billion 
light years away. These included
14.000 galaxies in the Extended 
Groth Strip.
Faber said, “The bigger the 
redshift, the further away the 
galaxy is.”
Furthermore, galaxies are typ­
ically sorted into two different 
classes: spheroidal and flattened 
disc galaxies. Spheroidal galaxies 
are worn out and do not produce 
stars, whereas flattened disc gal­
axies are actively producing new
stellar populations.
“In the course of this research, - 
we noticed a change in the ratio, 
of spheroidal versus flattened, 
disc galaxies. There appear to1 
be many more spheroidal galaxy 
ies than flattened disc galaxies*”; 
Faber said.
She said that, “basically, thfe' 
universe is 14 billion years old,’ 
and through our technology we. 
can see the universe as it was, 
about nine billion years back.; 
Thus, it is now possible, by com- ; 
bining all these different types of 
radiation in the electromagnetic 
spectrum, to see the universe 
capture the galaxies in thejjr 
infancy.”

Acknowledging cultural difference
---------------------------------------------------- and implicitly prohibits homosexual
II U • acts; in fact, it condemns them under
all circumstances, as does Christianity. 
,1 l~ . • • Under Islam, no explanation or justi-
\ % Marium Chandna fication for homosexuality — whether
scientific or genetic, moral or ethical — 
is accepted, and like it or not, Iran is an 
Islamic Republic. However, nowadays 
it is not considered politically correct 
to condemn homosexual behavior, and 
regardless of their personal opinion 
on the subject, most educated Muslims 
don’t discriminate at all.
I accept that the president refused 
to conform or adapt his beliefs to the 
modern conventions during his speech 
at Columbia. However, we must un­
derstand that this man comes from a 
society where more than being reli­
giously taboo, it is considered a matter 
of shame or a loss of honor if a father 
has a son or daughter with homosexual 
leanings. It often results in social exclu­
sion. So, yes, in Iran homosexuality is 
not conventionally defended by human 
rights, gay rights, or any other form of 
resistance. It is simply not a part of the 
culture, was not a part of the culture 
prior to Ahmadinejad’s presidency, and 
may not ever be.
Ahmadinejad hails from a humble 
background, and is not a diplomat. 
Therefore he was unable to seek refuge 
in politically correct language. When he 
said that “In Iran, we do not have homo­
sexuals,” what he actually meant is that 
the concept of homosexuality as a mat­
ter of liberal choice or preference does 
not exist in the Iranian society. It exists, 
but as an abnormality, not as a lifestyle.
Regardless of our majors, at Carnegie 
Mellon University we are all guided by 
one fundamental rule: to have open 
enough minds to innovate and think 
critically. Regardless of ourbackgrounds 
and biases, I propose that we live up to 
the Carnegie Mellon tradition.

“In Iran, we do not have homosexuals 
like in your country. We don’t have that 
in our country. In Iran, we do not have 
this phenomenon,” said Iranian Presi­
dent Mahmoud Ahmadinejad in his 
Sept. 24 speech at Columbia University.
Prior to imparting his stance on ho­
mosexuality in Iran, the leader was 
given a warm 20-minute welcome by his 
host, Columbia University President Lee 
C. Bollinger, in which Bollinger called 
the leader of Iran “illiterate,” “evil,” and 
basically unworthy of being present at 
the symposium.
“Today, I feel all the weight of the 
modern civilized world yearning to ex­
press revulsion at what you stand for,” 
Bollinger said to his guest.
Though Bollinger managed to hoard 
most of the speech time allocated to the 
Iranian president, I won’t let him con­
sume any more of my article.
Before discussing Ahmadinejad’s 
alleged disavowal of Iranian homosexu­
ality, let’s take into account some facts 
about the leader. He is well-educated, 
having attended university in Iran and 
earned his master’s degree in civil en­
gineering. Despite his rustic dress, he is 
not a fool. He is a practicing Muslim, but 
not an extremist. Extremists are devoid 
of reason, cannot logically explain their 
actions, and rely mainly on the fear of 
God to win an argument. The attempt to 
paint the president as an illiterate Mus­
lim fundamental fanatic is erroneous.
Now on to Ahmadinejad’s contro­
versial reply to a student’s question on 
homosexuality and the treatment of ho­
mosexuals in Iran. The issue here is not 
really the expression, but the validity of 
the expression. Examined closely and 
in appropriate context, Ahmadinejad’s 
statement is not wrong. It is absolutely 
right that being recognized as homo­
sexual in Iranian culture is not what it is 
in present-day America. Islam explicitly

Government creates dragonfly spy drones

current government projects involve live 
insects. Scientists insert computer chips 
into developing bugs (for example, moth 
pupae), with the hope that the insects’ 
nerves will form around the chip, thus 
allowing scientists to control them.
Such half-robot, half-insect cre­

experimenting with insect drones since 
the 1970s, but none have admitted to

Ghost Bike Pittsburgh should be

Ever since General Douglas MacAr- 
thur established the requirement that all 
members of the service academies par­
ticipate in an athletic activity, athletic 
challenges have been used to push the 
future leaders of the United States mili­
tary. On Sept. 29, the Carnegie Mellon 
NROTC unit gathered with teams from 
the NROTC units at Villanova, Penn 
State, and Penn to hold the very first 
Pennsylvania Military Excellence Com­
petition (PENN MEC).
MEC events are an opportunity for 
NROTC units to display their athletic 
prowess by having their midshipmen 
participate in track and swimming 
events, a basketball tournament, a Ma­
rine Corps physical fitness test, and an 
8K trail run. Another purpose of a MEC is 
for midshipmen to build esprit de corps 
by cheering for their shipmates and en­
gaging in a little good-natured compe­
tition with other NROTC units. While 
MECs take place across the country, 
never before has Pittsburgh hosted such 
an event. This year’s PENN MEC marked 
the first time that a MEC was held spe­
cifically for the four NROTC units in the 
state of Pennsylvania.
The concept of a Pennsylvania-only 
MEC was first proposed during the last 
school year after Captain Bowman, 
the Commanding Officer of Carnegie 
Mellon’s NROTC, saw that the NROTC 
units from Pennsylvania were consis­
tently in first or second place at the
College students’ satire attempts often offend
As has so frequently been the case on 
college campuses recently, it turns out 
that what most everyone perceived to be 
a blatantly offensive display was in fact 
intended to be “satirical.” The day after 
the posters first appeared, a group of 
seven GW students wrote a letter to The 
GW Hatchet, an independent student 
newspaper, taking responsibility for the 
posters. In the letter, the students called 
their posters “creative political action” 
intended to expose the racism of the 
YAF’s Islamo-Facism Awareness Week, 
which the students say equates Islam 
with terrorism.
Last year, Princeton University’s stu­
dent newspaper printed an article mak­
ing fun of Asian people in their joke is­
sue that the staff claimed was intended 
to “lampoon racism.” Our own campus’s 
readme also came under fire last year 
for writing a piece that implied that a 
Carnegie Mellon dorm was akin to a 
Nazi concentration camp. The list of of­
fensive material intended to be “funny”
Last Monday, posters reading “Hate 
Muslims? So do we!!!” were plastered 
all over George Washington University’s 
(GWU) campus in Washington, D.C. 
The anonymously distributed posters 
advertised an Islamo-Facism Aware­
ness Week on campus, and featured a 
drawing of a “Muslim” man that labeled 
several features of “your typical Mus­
lim,” including “lasers in eyes,” “hatred 
for women,” and a “hidden AK-47.”
The signage elicited an immdiate out­
rage from the campus community. As 
soon as Monday evening, a forum was 
held to discuss the posters. Muslim stu­
dents spoke about feeling attacked by 
the poster’s message, and the university 
president issued a statement condemn­
ing the document. The Young America’s 
Foundation (YAF), a conservative stu­
dent group that is the body that will 
actually be hosting Islamo-Facism 
Awareness Week later this month, vehe­
mently denied any involvement with the 
posters.
at college campuses goes on.
Popular as programs like The Daily 
Show and The Colbert Report are, col­
lege students should realize that they 
don’t yet have the ethos to execute satire 
with the intelligence and charm of Jon 
Stewart or Stephen Colbert. The popular 
Comedy Central TV shows pair parody 
with context instead of anonymously 
spewing material that many could find 
offensive or hurtful. As powerful of a po­
litical tool as satire has been throughout 
the ages, if done improperly, it can cause 
more harm than good. For that reason, 
it’s a tool to be wielded only by the truly 
experienced.
The seven GW students’ intentions 
were noble, but there are certainly 
easier and less offensive ways to con­
demn what the students perceive to be 
an Islamophobic event. Rallies, protests, 
and well-argued editorials are all ways 
to start a real campus dialogue about 
racism. Students need to earn their 
stripes before attempting satire.

Reevaluating our motives for discrediting other peoples’ faith
Steven Weinberg
It’s difficult to go through 
college without getting into some 
kind of religious debate — or at 
least witnessing one. I’m not refer­
ring to a theological argument on 
the proper interpretation of a 
certain religion. Nor am I talking 
about a socio-political debate on 
topics like teaching creationism 
in schools, the influence that the 
Christian Right has over the Bush 
administration, or to what extent 
the waning of formalized religion 
has caused our society’s profliga­
cy. Rather, I am referring to those 
heated disputes that take place 
over that big question: Is there a 
God, and who is He (he)?
We’ve all seen this type of reli­
gious debate among our fellow 
college students. Usually, it con­
sists of one ardent atheist, one 
ardent religious person (usually 
a Christian since we live in the 
United States), and a few other 
people who are a bit more neutral 
and temperate in their beliefs. 
These nasty disputes can last for 
hours, each side desperately hop­
ing to make his opponent realize 
his foolishness. At the end of all
this rancor, the two people walk 
away just as steadfast in their 
beliefs as they were before the 
conversation began (by this point, 
the dispassionate participants are 
long gone). In other words, noth­
ing has been accomplished.
We are all aware that turning 
an orthodox believer into an athe­
ist and vice versa is next to impos­
sible. Often with these arguments 
then, it seems that at best we 
waste a few hours of a precious 
Saturday night; at worst, we lose 
a friend. But when you think 
about it, these discussions can 
potentially have consequences 
that are much more severe.
One often wonders what 
would happen if a non-believer 
effectively persuaded the religious 
person to renounce all of his 
former beliefs and stop believing 
in God. The non-believer may feel 
smug and victorious for a while, 
but shortly thereafter, a deep 
remorse would set in. Through 
carefully reasoned logic and 
rhetoric, the non-believer would 
be effectively depriving this per­
son of all those beliefs and ideals 
that once gave him such hope 
and contentment. And any moral 
human being would surely feel 
contrite for taking away another 
person’s faith. After all, some
people would rather be robbed of 
all their possessions and property 
than lose their faith. This could 
be a crime worse than burglary!
It’s one thing if you believe 
that religion is the root of all evil, 
and that every religious person is 
somehow wreaking havoc upon 
the world. If you turn bin Laden 
into an atheist, I will personally 
thank you. It’s one thing if your 
friend is terrified that he might 
go to hell and spends every day 
confessing to a priest and you try 
to get him to tone it down a bit. 
There are many fine arguments 
to be made for wiping religion off 
the face of the Earth, and just as 
many for keeping it here. In other 
words, if your motives for convert­
ing a religious person are truly 
benevolent, then go right ahead. 
After all, then you’re no different 
from the religious groups who try 
to convert non-believers, who, for 
their general good will, do not fall 
under the scope of this criticism. 
(I will defend any group who 
proselytizes so long as they don’t 
do so forcibly or through manip­
ulation.) Giving someone God 
is, by its very nature, more self­
less and benevolent than taking 
someone’s God away. Moreover, 
it’s almost counterintuitive to 
think that all non-believers have
altruistic motives in mind when 
they engage in these debates. I’m 
not exactly sure what motivates a 
non-believer to get another person 
to stop believing in his or her god, 
but I suspect it comes from the 
deeply rooted human desire to 
prove other people wrong, and 
feel oneself to be right.
This desire to kill another per­
son’s god without any praisewor­
thy reason for doing so extends 
far beyond the world of the col­
lege dorm room. In his 2003 
worldwide best seller, The Da 
Vinci Code, Dan Brown sought 
to challenge the validity of the 
Bible and the very divinity of 
Jesus Christ, often using pseudo­
history and folklore. Did Dan 
Brown have benevolent motives 
in mind when he wrote a book 
that risked robbing millions of 
people of their sacrosanct beliefs? 
Or did he just want to create 
a stir and be famous? And Dan 
Brown is not the only one — any­
one familiar with the shelves at 
Barnes & Noble knows that there 
is an exorbitant amount of lit­
erature out there that advocates 
this conspiracy theory. Given the 
wide authorship and readership 
of these books, we can safely say 
that at least some people really 
want to turn Christianity on its
head if not destroy it altogether
— the question is: Why? Maybe 
these writers and their follow­
ers really do think that their 
research will hasten the way for 
a godless utopia — or maybe 
they just want to be able to tap a 
pious Christian on the shoulder 
and say authoritatively, “Did you 
know that Jesus had a wife?” 
Obviously, we should never 
sacrifice historical inquiry, open 
debate, and freedom of speech 
to decrease the risk that we’ll 
trample upon someone else’s 
religious faith. Nevertheless, 
we should always evaluate our 
objectives in turning another 
person towards our own way 
of thinking. Are we persuading 
with our audience’s best inter­
ests in mind? We should deal 
with matters of religious faith 
cautiously, always mindful of 
where our research and rhetoric 
will lead us. And if you really 
want to engage in an often futile 
debate that can only help your 
opponent and the society around 
him, convince a Republican to 
become a Democrat.

senior majoring in English. If you 
get him drunk, he just might dis­

Free speech rights don’t end where offensiveness begins
Beckman-Harned
Free speech won a rare vic­
tory last Friday when the 
editor-in-chief of Colorado State 
University’s student paper, The 
Rocky Mountain Collegian, was 
chastised but allowed to keep his 
job. The editor, J. David McSwane, 
okayed an editorial stating “Taser 
this, fuck Bush,” which ran in a 
very large font in a space the size 
this article takes up. The story 
made worldwide news as those 
four little words outraged and 
infuriated. Shocking, I know — 
who knew that people actually 
read college newspapers?
The First Amendment can use 
all the victories it can get; things 
aren’t going so well. At the end 
of September, the Senate con­
demned MoveOn.org for their 
“General Petraeus or General 
Betray Us” ad, and Congress 
seems on the verge of awarding 
the NSA extended wiretapping 
powers. At least our thoughts are 
still safe.
Of course, in McSwane’s case, 
it wasn’t just a matter of political 
views, but profanity. I support 
using profanity sparsely, myself
— if you drop the F-bomb because 
the weather dropped 20 degrees, 
what words will you have left 
to use when you lose both legs 
thanks to gangrene? But as far 
as I’m concerned, there’s no need 
to censor a newspaper intended 
almost entirely for college stu­
dents. My undergraduate news­
paper, The Daily Tar Heel, went 
one step further, banning one of 
my (brilliant) cartoons because it 
had two letters in it, “FU.” Come 
on. Anyone who knows what 
the “f’ stands for doesn’t need 
to be protected. Urthermore, i 
you start orbidding the letter “f,” 
you’ll look pretty reaking oolish.
Should McSwane have written 
nuanced, well-thought-out politi­
cal commentary rather than just 
slamming the president? Maybe.
But if he had chosen nuanced 
and well-thought:out over shock­
ing, the only ones who would 
have read it would be those who 
agreed with him, and his editorial 
would have disappeared into the 
recycling bin forever. It certainly 
wouldn’t have made CNN, and 
certainly not the UK’s Guardian.
It’s funny how most people are 
all in favor of free speech until 
someone mocks their beliefs. 
Remember when the actor who 
voiced the chef.on South Park quit 
because of the episode making fun 
of Scientology? He didn’t mind 
when the show mocked, hmmm, 
let’s see, everything else. Last 
week, Republican presidential
candidate Mike Huckabee stood 
up for Rush Limbaugh’s First 
Amendment rights when the 
talk show host called veterans 
opposed to the war “phony sol­
diers,” even though Huckabee had 
condemned MoveOn.org’s con­
troversial ad only weeks before. 
I guess these jerkwads haven’t 
heard Voltaire’s oft-quoted com­
ment on free speech: “I disagree 
with what you say, but I will 
defend to the death your right 
to say it.” s
Along with the quote from 
Voltaire, almost every high 
school civics teacher cites the 
case of the Nazis in Skokie, 111. 
A troop of Nazi party members,
Lizzee Solomon/Art Staff
decked out in swastika-studded 
uniforms, decided to march 
through Skokie’s Jewish neigh­
borhoods. The Illinois Supreme 
Court decided that the fact that 
the Nazis were being assholes 
didn’t preclude their rights of free 
expression, but the controversy 
raises an interesting problem
— far more interesting than the 
question of whether profanity is 
destroying our children. Where’s 
the line between “free speech” 
and “hate crime”?
The fact that the Nazis wanted 
to march through Jewish neigh­
borhoods proved that they were 
more interested in pissing people 
off than making any kind of state-
ment, but does that mean they 
shouldn’t have been allowed to 
do so? If we start trying to ban 
free speech any place a listener 
would be offended, we’ll be back 
at square one. But at the same 
time, my heart aches to think of 
the Jewish families watching the 
Nazis march past from behind 
their curtains or gay teenagers 
being forced to hear from their 
health teacher that they’re going 
to hell. Unfortunately, jerks 
aren’t going to stop being jerks 
because a law tells them to, and 
the best course of action may 
be to give people on both sides 
of each issue plenty of time to 
have their say, nuanced and well 
thought-out or not. Then, at the 
very least, no one will be able to 
plead ignorance.
So here’s my message to those 
of you who think free speech has 
gone too far. Great! Condemn 
away — be glad that we have 
enough First Amendment rights 
in this country for you to do so. 
Take my advice and stop quoting 
the things that shock you so 
damn much. All you’re doing is 
exacerbating the Janet Jackson 
boob effect — every time you 
show the offending quote, ad, 
image, or clip you’re just giving 
your enemies free advertising. 
Thanks to Congress and every 
news outlet in existence, every­
body (not just those bleeding- 
heart liberals) is aware of that 
deeply offensive MoveOn.org 
ad. Thanks to everyone from Fox 
News to The Tartan, McSwane’s 
editorial has thousands more 
readers than it would have other­
wise. So hey, First Amendment- 
haters, go right ahead telling the 
world what shocks you if you 
want — I, personally, love get­
ting free press. But if I were you, 
I’d shut my mouth.

Election reforms 
and platform 
initiatives
Sean Weinstock & Adi Jain
Hey Tartans. After some 
amazing warm weather, here 
comes that time of year when 
we get to trudge to class on Mon­
day morning in the brisk cold 
weather of fall. While we can’t 
change the climate (we could buy 
a “big rig” and cruise around in it 
all day every day to cause more 
global warming, but that’s not 
cool), Adi and I have been work­
ing very hard to make things 
brighter on campus.
This week we tackled several 
things. I’ll start with the state 
of election reform. Last week I 
wrote about our reaching out to 
GSA and Senate to get some of 
your student leadership on board 
for the long haul ahead to make 
a sustainable election system. 
This week, we were filtering 
interest and have been able to 
come up with a fairly represen­
tative committee to go over all 
the election rules: which ones 
make things better and which 
ones need to be thrown out or re­
written. We are looking to make 
more progress on that in the 
coming weeks.
Secondly, we started meeting 
with the Multicultural Presi­
dents Council (MPC) in order to 
put the wheels in motion on our 
Cultural FX initiative. We think 
that the MPC is a great, action- 
oriented organization that shares 
a lot of the views we hold about 
the cultural atmosphere on cam­
pus. We really aim to bring those 
organizations closer together 
among themselves, with student 
government as a whole, and with 
other student groups across cam­
pus that they have not tradition­
ally associated with. Adi and I 
believe our ambitions to be in 
line with the MPC’s, and we hope 
that the collaboration will pro­
duce positive results.
Our interaction with the MPC 
ties into our Institutional Mem­
ory issue, which we have also be­
gun working on. Whether or not 
the Tartan Wiki will be around 
in its original form is still debat­
able. However, we do know that 
there will be a tool that makes it 
easier for all student organiza­
tions to keep track of what hap­
pens from year to year. That way, 
if there are some patches where 
knowledge is not conveyed from 
leader to leader, the new party 
can always check back with past 
happenings, no matter how much 
time has gone by. We believe that 
teaming up with the OrgTracker 
team and consolidating every­
thing into one product is the best 
way of accomplishing our goals.
Adi and I are both very excited 
about the progress that’s being 
made across the board. Once 
again, if you have any ideas or 
general comments, feel free to 
contact us at cmu5@cmu.edu. 
Until next time, bundle up and 
keep healthy.*

FOOTBALL, from A12
In overtime, the Tartans 
started with the ball at the 25- 
yard line; they gained three 
yards on three plays, and then 
attempted a 40-yard field goal. 
Marks’ field goal attempt was off 
the mark and Case took over at 
the 25 yard mark. Case managed 
one first down before their drive 
stalled and Spartan kicker Sam 
Coffey barely connected on the 
30-yard field goal.
Case gained 303 yards of total 
offense compared to the Tartans’ 
241 yards. Sivek banged his way 
to 141 yards rushing on 37 car­
ries.
“It’s always good to see a back 
like Travis that’s going to work 
for you,” Freeman said. “When 
he’s fighting through tackles and 
breaking tackles, it makes you 
want to work that much harder 
to get that extra block and push 
forward.”
Junior cornerback Jake Cundiff (#4) tackles a Case player during Saturday’s game.
Seniors Jon Scholl and Jona­
than Bodnar led the Tartan de­
fense with 11 tackles apiece.
“We have a good defense when 
we focus and don’t make mis­
takes,” Kresge said. “I thought 
we did a pretty good job today. 
We did have some mistakes here 
and there, but all in all it was a 
solid effort.”
The Tartans will look to snap 
their four-game losing streak 
Saturday when they travel to 
play the University of Chicago 
with kickoff slated for 1 p.m.

week yesterday with a UAA game 
against Case. Carnegie Mellon 
took the early lead before Case 
answered with a pair of goals 
before halftime. The Spartans 
added a third goal in the 58th 
minute.
Sophomore forward Patrick 
Lutz netted a goal in the 17th 
minute off a corner kick from 
first-year midfielder Adam Bo­
gus. Case responded with goals 
in the 25th minute (off a penalty 
kick) and the 32nd minute (the 
game-winning goal).
Sophomore forward Ricky 
Griffin and the Tartan offense 
pressured the Spartans all day. 
Case goalie Chad Skidmore made 
eight saves in the game, includ­
ing a pair of shots from Griffin in 
the 62nd and 63rd minutes.
“It seems that we’re getting 
into this habit [of coming from
behind], and I don’t think it’s a 
particularly good one,” Hall said. 
“It does say something about our 
character that we’re able to come 
back and win games after being 
behind, or being tied, and coming 
back in the late minutes shows 
we don’t give up and that we 
have good character as a team. 
We have to take that character a 
bit farther, not give up goals, and 
put a complete game together. 
We need to not put ourselves in
the situation where we have to 
come back in the late minutes of 
the game.”
The win against La Roche and 
the losses in the two important 
UAA games leaves Carnegie 
Mellon with a record of 7-3-1 
overall and 0-3-1 in the UAA.

Al2 . _________THE TARTAN________ _________ October 15, 2007
Tartan volleyball wins 
two UAA match-ups
by Christina Collura
Staffwriter
This past weekend, the Carn­
egie Mellon women’s volleyball 
team traveled to Cleveland to 
participate in the second round 
of the University Athletic As-' 
sociation (UAA) Round Robin 
tournament.
The Tartans faced New York 
University, Brandeis Univer­
sity, Emory University, and the 
University of Rochester. The 
Tartans defeated New York and 
Rochester.
On Saturday, the Tartans 
opened the tournament against 
New York, defeating the Violets 
in three games (30-24, 30-26, 
30-28). The Tartans had not 
won a match against New York 
since the 2004 season.
Sophomore middle hitter Jes­
sica Brackin and junior middle 
hitter Chisom Amaechi led the 
Tartans, combining for a total of 
21 kills. “Brackin and Amaechi 
really stepped up for the team, 
played well, and had some really 
clutch hits for us,” senior middle 
hitter Abbie Toney said.
“It was an awesome game,” 
Amaechi said. “Everything was 
on point, our passing [and] ser­
vicing. We were just a cohesive 
unit and they just couldn’t play 
with us.”
Also vital in the game against 
New York was senior outside hit- 
tlr Katie Stepp, with eight kills
and six digs, and sophomore 
setter Samantha Carter, who set 
up 38 kills, served two aces, and 
had four blocks.
Later Saturday afternoon, the 
Tartans faced Brandeis, falling 
to the Judges in five games. The 
Tartans won the first (30-25) 
and third games (30-22) of the 
match, but could not hold off a 
Brandeis rally during game four. 
The Judges won the final game 
16-14 to secure the match win.
First-year middle hitter Caro­
line Size, Brackin, and Stepp had

Women’s soccer narrowly defeats Case 1-0

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
soccer team played two Univer­
sity Athletic Association (UAA) 
games last week, tying the Uni­
versity of Rochester 1-1 after 
double overtime Friday evening, 
and defeating Case Western Re­
serve University Sunday 1-0. The 
Tartans are now 7-4-2 for the 
season and 2-1-1 in the UAA.
On Friday against Rochester, 
the Yellowjackets (8-3-1, 3-0-1 
UAA) attacked first when senior 
midfielder Ali Streeter tipped in 
a corner kick from junior mid­
fielder Laura Bojko in the 18th 
minute of play. The goal was
Streeter’s third for the season.
The Yellowjackets continued 
to pepper the Tartan goal, but 
Carnegie Mellon first-year goal­
keeper Anya Rosen remained 
tough, making four saves in the 
first period and seven through­
out the game.
Rochester senior goalie Molly 
Leitch recorded two saves during 
the game. Leitch’s saves came 
from shots by Tartan leading 
goal-scorer junior Abby Coffin. 
Last week, Coffin was named 
UAA women’s soccer Athlete of 
the Week for the second week in 
a row. Coffin leads Carnegie Mel­
lon with 10 goals and 21 points 
this season.
The Tartans finally tied the 
game at 1-1 late in the second pe­
riod when junior defender Sarah 
DeWath chipped in a corner kick
from senior defender Amanda 
Rose during the 80th minute of 
play. Neither team was able to 
score in the remaining 20 min­
utes of regulation time, forcing 
the game into overtime.
Carnegie Mellon remained on 
the defensive during overtime. 
In the eighth minute of the first 
overtime, a Rochester corner 
kick hit the Tartan back post, 
but deflected out. In the second 
minute of the second overtime, 
Rochester almost scored again, 
but DeWath cleared the ball off 
the line to keep the Tartans in the 
game. Ultimately, the Tartans 
and Yellowjackets would settle 
for the 1-1 tie.
“I think we are really starting to 
figure things out in the defense,” 
junior defender Mary Ashe said. 
“We are communicating and
getting comfortable with where 
everyone is. We are giving up 
fewer shots and fewer goals.”
Traveling to Cleveland on Sun­
day, the Tartans faced off against 
Case (6-8, 0-4 UAA), defeating 
the Spartans 1-0. Carnegie Mel­
lon got off to a slow start, taking 
only one shot in the first half. 
Rosen made two saves in the first 
half to keep the Spartans off the 
board.
The Tartan goal wasn’t scored 
until the 69th minute of play 
when first-year forward Valerie 
Corvino dribbled around Case 
goalkeeper Kristen McClain and 
fed the ball to senior forward 
Kasey Stever, who found the back 
of the open net.
“Valerie was really smart and

beats La Roche 2-1
Men’s cross country team wins home invitational
on the board, cutting the deficit 
to 10-3. The score would stay at 
10-3 heading into halftime.
The Tartans started the second 
half strong, scoring 14 straight 
points in a span of 2:06 to take 
the lead heading into the fourth 
quarter. Kresge intercepted 
Whalen’s pass and returned it 
71 yards for the touchdown. The 
extra point was missed however, 
so Case clung to a 10-9 lead.
The Tartans got the ball right 
back when senior defensive line­
man Mike Reggie recovered a 
botched handoff by the Spar­
tans. Senior fullback Travis Sivek 
found the end zone on a run from
2 yards out and the Tartans con­
verted the two-point conversion 
to take a 17-10 lead.
“After halftime we decided to 
go right at their defense and at­
tack them,” Freeman said. “Our 
front five was dominating them 
up front and we got up to their 
linebackers. That was the biggest 
adjustment.”
Case fought back, forcing a 
fumble by Tartan sophomore 
quarterback Phil Pantalone as 
the Tartans were inside Case’s
5-yard line with just over two 
minutes to go in the third quar­
ter. Case tied the game at 17 with 
5:26 to play in regulation cour­
tesy of an 11-play drive eating up 
4:13 of game clock.
“Case has a good offense,” 
Kresge said. “They move the ball 
well, they throw the ball well, 
and they run hard. We had our 
hands full but I think we did a 
decent job.”

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
soccer team played three games 
this past week against La Roche 
College, University of Roches­
ter, and Case Western Reserve 
University.
The Tartans started on a good 
note, defeating the La Roche 
Redhawks 2-1 in double over­
time Tuesday night.
The games over the weekend 
didn’t go as well, with the Tar­
tans losing at Rochester 2-0 
Friday and losing 3-1 at Case 
Sunday afternoon.
Against La Roche Tuesday, 
sophomore midfielder Jonathan 
Hall gave Carnegie Mellon the 
early lead in the 13th minute 
when he headed home a corner 
kick from first-year midfielder 
Max Betzig.
“On the first goal I had an op­
portunity right before the corner 
kick actually,” Hall said. “I kind 
of blew it. I was determined 
to at least get my head on the 
ball. I did that and it was a little 
floater and luckily it got over the 
keeper, so it was a nice one to 
start out with and jump out to an 
early lead.”
The Tartans took the 1-0 lead 
into halftime, but La Roche re­
sponded 79 seconds into the 
second half with the equalizer. 
Sophomore Redhawks Alaa 
Khdaier’s shot from 25 yards 
out got past Tartan junior goal­
keeper Matthew Bazin.
The score remained dead­
locked at one through the 
remainder of the second half and 
the first overtime. Sophomore 
midfielder Ryan Browne set up 
the game-winning goal when his 
cross from the right corner of the 
field sailed into the middle of the 
box. A sprinting Hall entered the 
box and redirected the cross into 
the right side of the goal to end 
the game.
“In overtime I was just trying 
to get into the box on that one 
because we knew how important 
it was not to tie this game,” Hall 
said. “That’s what coach said go­
ing into that overtime was that 
we just need to get guys into the 
box and get the ball in there and 
hope to see if we can put one in. 
Ryan had an awesome cross in 
and all I [had] to do was basi­
cally be in the right spot. He put 
it there and luckily we put it in.”
Carnegie Mellon’s University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
weekend road trip started with a 
game Friday against Rochester. 
No goals were scored until the 
70th minute when Rochester got 
on the board on a breakaway. The 
Yellowjackets added an insur­
ance goal in the 72nd minute.
The Tartans had scoring 
chances throughout, but Roches­
ter’s defense was up to the task. 
Rochester goalie Michael Pea­
cock made five saves including 
one on a low rocket from Browne 
in the 58th minute.

On Saturday, the men’s cross 
country team won its home in­
vitational, taking the top team 
score among 23 teams with 31 
points. Duquesne University 
took second place with 56 points, 
while George Washington Uni­
versity placed third with 84 
points.
The meet took place in Schen­
ley Park, and the Carnegie 
Mellon runners thrived in the 
ideal weather conditions and 
the support of a home crowd and 
alumni. Carnegie Mellon men’s 
cross country alumni also fielded 
a teaiiV for a race, placing ninth
overall with 270 points.
Unattached runner Christo­
pher Clark won the individual 
race and set a new course record 
with a time of 25:01.35.
The Tartans saw four runners 
finish in the top 10. Junior Brian 
Harvey led the team to finish 
second overall with a time of 
25:39.96. Master’s student Geoff 
Misek placed fourth overall with 
a time of 25:56.20.
Junior Breck Fresen and 
junior Ryan Anderson took sev­
enth and eighth overall with 
times of 26:06.45 and 26:08.28,

Senior Jason Jura rounded out 
the top 11 runners for the Tar­
tans by taking 44th overall with 
a time of 27:09.44.
“I was very excited to see the 
team run well. We have had high 
expectations this year and until 
now we have yet to have a signifi­
cant team showing,” Jura said. “I 
was glad to end my cross country 
career on a strong performance, 
but it’s always hard knowing
I was only three seconds from 
moving on to [the] conference 
championships, which I have run 
all three years previous to this.”
The top 10 runners will 
compete at the University Ath­
letic Association championships 
Saturday, Oct. 27. The champi­
onships will be held at Brandeis 
University.

Senior fullback Travis Sivek (#35) runs with the ball during Saturday afternoon’s game against Case.
by Doug Fricker
Senior Sports Staff
The Carnegie Mellon foot­
ball team hasn’t received many 
breaks lately, as they opened up 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) play with a 20-17 loss in 
overtime Saturday at the hands 
of the visiting Case Western Re­
serve Spartans. After the Tartans 
(2-4 overall, 0-1 in the UAA) 
failed to score on their overtime 
possession, Case (6-0, 1-0) at­
tempted a 3 0-yard field goal 
that was partially blocked but
still managed to barely clear the 
crossbar, giving the Spartans the 
Academic Bowl Trophy.
“I thought the [defense] came 
out fired up and played very 
well,” sophomore safety Josh 
Kresge said. “We just came up a 
little short at the end but all in all 
the effort was there. We’re going 
to come back strong and don’t 
count us out yet.”
“We were focused on keeping 
the turnovers low and working 
the line because our rushing at­
tack has been solid in the past,” 
junior offensive tackle Brian 
Freeman said. “We just wanted
to hold onto the ball and keep 
driving and we just came up a 
little bit short today.”
Carnegie Mellon found itself 
trailing 10-0 early in the game, 
as the Spartans received the 
opening kickoff and drove down 
the field, scoring a touchdown 
on a pass from quarterback 
Dan Whalen to receiver Brian 
Webster. Case tacked on a field 
goal after a Carnegie Mellon 
turnover.
With 8:06 remaining in the 
first half, Tartan junior kicker Co­
lin Marks made a field goal from 
26 yards out to get the Tartans

WELCOME BACK FOR HOMECOMING 2007. This special issue commemorates the H 
last 50 years of Homecoming celebrations, for the decade anniversaries of alumni
— starting from 1956-1957 and ending with 2006-2007. Inside, you will find a
compilation of articles that show the journey of Carnegie Mellon University. And we have a 
host of new content to explain and illuminate the events that make up this year’s Homecoming, 
as well as some other stories of alumni and student interest. For those who are quite familiar with
this place, those of you who live nearby or have occasion to be here on a daily basis, we nevertheless
invite you to read further. This issue is a guide to all students, alumni, and members of the community 
who want to explore what Carnegie Mellon has to offer during this four-day celebration of our university.

you can’t be proud and you can’t 
carry it out unless you are sure 
of yourself arjd prepared. That’s 
where the nerds stand tall!”
He was awarded an honorary 
doctorate of humane letters from 
Carnegie Mellon.
Others were awarded 
honorary diplomas, including 
classical pianist Earl Wild, who 
was awarded a doctorate of fíne 
arts and Gerald C. Meyers, for­
mer Tepper School professor and 
executive with American Mo­
tors, Ford Motor Company and 
the Chrysler Corporation, who 
was given a doctorate of business 
practice.
The day following commence­
ment, President Jared L. Cohon 
was confirmed as university 
president for another five-year 
term. This will be Cohon’s third 
term since coming to Carnegie 
Mellon from Yale University in 
1992.
During Cohon’s time in office, 
the university has dramatically 
changed, even in this past year.
Last year, Carnegie Mellon was 
ranked the 22nd-best national 
university by U.S. News & World 
Report. For undergraduates, the 
Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy was ranked fifth and the 
Tepper School of Business sev­
enth. The graduate programs in 
computer science and engineer­
ing continued their reign in the 
top 10, ranking first and sixth, 
respectively.
Over the past 10 years, en­
rollment has increased by 68 
percent, with this year’s first-year 
class coming in at an all-time 
high of 1436.
The upcoming year will surely 
see more changes for Carnegie 
Mellon.

Although this past school year 
has not brought a statue as far- 
reaching as 2005’s “Walking to 
the Sky,” 2006-2007 was a year 
in no way lacking in news and 
campus events.
Carnegie Mellon awarded 
over 2000 diplomas in May, saw 
Bill Cosby as commencement 
speaker, President Cohon elected 
to another term, and another 
Carnival come and go.
Carnival 2006 was themed 
“Small Things Made Large” 
and featured a fierce Booth and 
Buggy competition.
The Booth independent 
category was won by the Asian 
Students Association for its ren­
dition of Monopoly. Sigma Phi 
Epsilon took the title for the 
fraternities with their two-story 
Super Nintendo wonderland, 
featuring a life-size Yoshi and 
working Game Boy. Kappa Alpha 
Theta won the sorority competi­
tion with its intricate beehive.
Buggy included some astonish­
ing performances. The men’s title 
was won by the Pi Kappa Alpha 
A team with a time of 2:07:39. 
The women’s category was taken 
by Student Dormitory Council, 
finishing at 2:31:00. Fringe took 
both first and second place in the 
design competition.
Commencement 2006 was a 
day to remember for the 2100 
graduate and undergraduate 
students who received their di­
plomas on Sunday, May 20 in 
Gesling Stadium.
Bill Cosby was the keynote 
speaker, talking especially of the 
“nerdy” reputation of Carnegie

of Homecoming.
Friday will be the start of campus tours, 
focusing on robotics, art, the Posner Center, 
the individual colleges, and the environment 
,among other topics. Alumni will have the 
chance to join their classmates on the “Ev­
erything New Since You Were Here” tour, 
featuring “Walking to the Sky,” the University

Vlock Election :avor Ike, 3-
Author Unknown
Published Nov. 6,1956
If CIT’s mock election re­
sults are in any way significant, 
the nation’s voters today will 
re-elect President Eisenhower 
by an overwhelming majority. 
Statistics show that he received 
75.6 percent of the total votes 
cast; Stevenson, 22.5 percent; 
and Carmen Monoxide, 1.26 
percent.
Faculty tallies present a dif­
ferent picture. Tech instructors 
elected Mr. Stevenson by a 1 per­
cent margin, 49.5 percent of the 
vote going to Eisenhower and 
50.5 percent to Stevenson.
The election, run by APhiO, 
was sponsored by CRA, Mortar­
board, and The Tartan. Student 
voters cast a total of 870 ballots, 
while only 83 faculty members

participated; 26.5 percent of the 
student body and 23.3 percent 
of the faculty took part.
Jay Early, president of APhiO, 
blamed the meager interest on 
the lack of publicity. Many were 
unable to vote because they did 
not have ID cards with them.
As compared with the last 
mock election, the 1956 effort 
shows an increase in political 
interest. Dr. Dale Strick, coordi­
nator of student activités, said in 
part, “We hope that the higher 
percentage of voters is an indica­
tion not only of student concern 
with politics but of a growing in­
terest in campus activities.”
Write-ins included Carmen 
Monoxide, the candidate sup­
ported by Rege Cordic, KDKA 
disc jockey, 11 votes; Sergeant 
Hideck, 1 vote; Pogo, 1 vote; 
MacArthur, 1 vote; and the So­
cialist Labor Party, 1 vote.

Two-storybuilding to replace Skibo
Author Unknown
Published April 9,1957
The Campus Activities Cen­
ter, a two-story building to 
face the Fine Arts lawn and to 
extend along the Cut, has been 
planned to meet the increas­
ingly pressing needs of student 
activities and for campus dining 
facilities.
Designed within a certain 
designated space and according 
to funds to be allocated from the 
$24 million plan, the plans for 
the building are still flexible. As 
they stand presently, however, 
the top (main) floor will consist 
primarily of lounge and dining 
facilities, and the lower floor of 
a recreation room, a ballroom 
which may open into the recre­
ation room to provide a larger 
dance hall, a small auditorium, 
commuter lounges, and meet­
ing rooms.
met by the most pressing needs 
such as dining facilities and 
meeting rooms, there is no large 
auditorium where the president 
may address the student body. 
This would require a separate 
building, which could fulfill 
that purpose as well as serve for 
commencement exercises and 
other events drawing large au­
diences. The small auditorium 
that is provided will probably 
be used for such functions as 
Varsity Varieties.
Because of the heavy traf­
fic within such a building, the 
Union is designed on two sto­
ries, so as not to require eleva­
tor facilities. The lower build­
ing (the top floor opens on to 
the terrace beside the Fine Arts 
lawn, so that externally the 
building will appear to be one 
story) also adds to the attrac­
tiveness of the mall, by not clos­
ing it in with high buildings.
Dining Rooms
The dining facilities on the 
first floor, while larger and more 
modern, will mostly duplicate 
those provided by Skibo now. 
That is, there is to be one large 
cafeteria for the use of students, 
plus an airy and attractive snack 
bar. The faculty and staff dining 
room will be supplemented by 
two small private dining rooms, 
primarily for the use of the pres­
ident. There is no dining room 
to fulfill the function that the 
present Union’s dining room 
and kitchen and the Morewood 
Gardens’ Blue Room do now.
The lounges, which extend 
along the side (facing the Cut 
walk and E & S) and the front, 
and face a paved terrace which 
will replace part of the road cur­
rently used for faculty parking, 
will be large, light, and airy, 
and will include, 'among other
things, an information desk.
The meeting rooms, on the 
lower floor, include rooms des­
ignated for the use of the four 
publications plus a radio sta­
tion, meeting rooms for reli­
gious organizations, and un­
designated rooms for the use 
of other organizations. Lockers 
and filing cabinets for the use 
of organizations requiring stor­
age space will probably line the 
lower floor corridors.
At present, the lounges for 
commuters are not designed to 
include showers for those who 
must stay on campus all day to 
attend a social function in the 
evening; they are planned only 
as resting places and possibly 
dressing rooms for the commut­
ers.

Sports In The 'Golden Era’: A Recap for the Golden Anniversary Issue
by Tom Beig
Published Oct. 30,1956
For this Golden Anniversary issue of The 
Tartan, let’s take a look back at some high­
lights of a very interesting period of sports 
at Carnegie Tech, the transition period 
from the days of football glory through 
the de-emphasis of varsity sports.
Through the late 1920s and the ’30s, 
Tech was regarded as a national football 
power almost every fall. The 1926 team is 
generally regarded as Tech’s strongest of 
the strong. That was the year that sopho­
more Howard Harpster led the Tartans 
to an upset victory over Knute Rockne’s 
Notre Dame power, and Lloyd Yoder was 
named an All-American Tackle. Tech 
outscored its opposition 207 to 23, beat­
ing Pitt and West Virginia, while losing to 
NYU andW&J.
But the late ’30s can rightfully be called 
the period when sports hit their peak 
here. In 1937 the Plaid once again up­
ended a previously unbeaten Notre Dame 
team, transforming a 2-5-1 record into
a successful season, against such foes as 
Michigan State, Purdue, Pitt, and Holy 
Cross. The next two years Tech lost the 
final games of its Notre Dame rivalry, 7-0 
and 7-6.
Lambert Trophy 1938
Perhaps the greatest honor given to a 
Carnegie Tech team was the Lambert Tro­
phy, awarded to the sportswriters’ choice 
for the strongest team in the East, received 
by Tech in 1938. The Kilties journeyed to 
the Sugar Bowl during the holidays, but 
lost to T.C.U., 15-7. Techsters Ray Con­
nelly, Jack Lee, and Don Campbell played 
in the annual College All-Stars versus 
Pro-Champions benefit game following 
that year.
But Carnegie’s national powers weren’t 
restricted to the gridiron. Tech’s rifle 
team placed second in the 1939 N.R.A. 
small-bore national championship, losing 
to Navy by a score of 1891-1871. Harold 
Green’s nomination to the All-American 
roster previewed John Herr’s similar ac­
complishments of 1955-56, and Russ Mc-
Millian was named to the All-American 
second team.
Soccer, Hockey, Baseball
The level of enthusiasm for sports in 
the late 30s is further shown by the orga­
nization and existence of teams in soccer, 
hockey, and baseball. A soccer team was 
begun in 1936 and scored an unimpres­
sive record. With little pre-season practice 
and ineligibility problems, the boosters 
surprised 1937 fans with a winning re­
cord and remained a power in western 
Pennsylvania until their dissolution late 
in the 1940s.
Tech also had a strong winter sport be­
sides basketball and swimming in hockey, 
until it also was discontinued mid-century. 
In the early ’40s Tech, like many smaller 
schools throughout the U.S., realized it 
could no longer support a big-time foot­
ball team, and began to de-emphasize. In 
1943, the Kilties met only five opponents, 
since many schools were dropping varsity 
athletics for the duration of World War II. 
Tech also discontinued football the next
season when 29 candidates turned out, 
only 11 of whom had played the game be­
fore.
Post-War
The fall of 1946 saw a world without 
war and a mass restitution of varsity 
sports at C.LT.
Football stormed back under coach Bill 
Donohoe to a perfect record: won — none, 
tied—none, points scored—none. Almost 
marring this flawless record, Tech threat­
ened twice, once reaching the 9-yard line. 
Mike Theodore, today the Tartan’s fresh­
man coach, returned from the Army to star 
on the basketball court as a sophomore. 
The swimming team picked up its peren­
nially strong performance right away, and 
Coach Halfertz’s first cross-country squad 
in three years brought home the best har­
rier record in many years.
De-emphasis was made complete in 
1948 with the elimination of all the ma­
jor foes from the Carnegie Mellon football 
schedule so that all opponents were in 
Tech’s class.
“Thimk & Snile”: A purposeful carnival
by Richard Aiken Spring
Carnival Co-chairman 
Published March 19,1957
A Carnival with a purpose 
has been the aim of the 1957 
Spring Carnival committee in 
planning for this year’s gala 
spring event. With the intention 
not only to provide the custom­
ary color and humor associated 
with a carnival, but to stimulate 
thinking and originality, the 
committee hit upon “Thimk & 
Snile.”
Essentially, what the com­
mittee has in mind for the 
fraternities and sororities is the 
humorous rendering of items 
(events, people, objects) in the 
1956-57 year significant in inter­
national, national, community, 
or campus history. In order to 
allow the competitors a wide 
selection of material for origi­
nality, the themes of the booths 
may be in any sector of culture,
but should be of sufficient inir 
portance to the community.
Originality
The emphasis is not on ex­
travagance but rather originality 
and ingenuity. The committee 
believes that Carnival will be 
that much more challenging and 
competitive by requiring thought 
rather than money to produce a 
winning booth. Color and humor 
will still play major roles in the 
development of the themes.
Also in the committee’s mind 
has been the importance of 
unity. Queen campaigns, both 
fraternity and sorority booths, 
and even Scotch ’n’ Soda will ad­
here closely to the theme of cur­
rent events. Naturally, the theme 
. will manifest itself primarily in 
the booths — for the fraternities, 
the major competition next to 
the Sweepstakes.
The Will of the People
A
Importance for all competing 
groups to realize is the part that 
the Spring Carnival Committee 
plays in planning the event. It is 
far from our intention to put be­
fore the competing groups any 
arbitrary set of rules. Rather, it is 
our purpose to collect the ideas 
from the various groups and 
try to arrive at the most practi­
cal combinations of these so as 
to please the greatest number 
of people involved. Naturally, 
not everyone will be wholly sat­
isfied with the final decisions 
made by the Committee regard­
ing booth competitions or queen 
campaigns. Due consideration 
is given to all suggestions pre­
sented by the competing groups.
All in all, we believe that we 
are offering a better-than-ever 
Carnival this year. With the co­
operation of the campus, the 
1957 Carnival should be one 
of the most memorable in Tech 
Carnival history.

Take Greek 
Sing Honors
Author Unknown
Published March 5, 1956
The first-place winners of the 
Greek Sing competition this 
year were Chi Omega and Alpha 
Tau Omega, led by Lou Herbst, 
a fourth-year music student, 
and Bob Hamilton, a third-year 
music student. Kappa Kappa 
Gamma and Kappa Sigma were 
second-place winners, while 
Delta Delta Delta and Delta Up- 
silon took third-place honors.
The awards were announced 
at Syria Mosque during the 
dance intermission last Satur­
day evening by Nancy Tresky 
and Bill Wilton, co-chairs of the 
annual affair. Chi Omega sang 
“The Inchworm” and “The Good 
Folks Who Dwell on Earth.” Last 
year the Chi Os finished third. 
Alpha Tau Omega, who finished 
third last year, were near perfec­
tion with their rendition of “The 
Grandfather’s Clock” and “The 
Echo Song,” to clinch first place.
Jan Folsom, who led the Kap­
pas to a first-place position the 
past two years, again received 
honors for her group, which 
sang “One Times One,” written 
by a local author, John Kestner, 
and Mist. Kappa Sigma, con­
ducted by a veteran of last year, 
Marilyn Jakub, chose “Hear My 
Prayer” and “Soon Ah Will Be 
Done” for their two songs. The 
Kappa Sigs won first-place hon­
ors last year.
Frank Bebic, a sophomore 
music student, conducted the 
Tri Delts to win honors for the 
third-place position.
The clever participation of 
Alpha Epsilon Phi and Delta Tau 
Delta added variety to the Greek 
Sing program. Frani Jungk and 
her sorority did a rendition of 
nursery rhymes in a Greek cho­
ral fashion. The Delts’ leader, 
Jack Sweeny, burst into the mu­
sic hall late to conduct his group 
in a riotous performance.

THE TARTAN • OCTOBER 15, 2007
Poll shows student job interests
Author Unknown
Published Oct. 16,1966
Results of the Tartan’s Bu­
reau of Placement summer 
job poll have been tabulated 
and the information analyzed. 
Although only 6.5 percent of 
the undergraduate population 
responded to the poll, some sig­
nificant information has been 
drawn from it.
According to the poll, the 
average summer job salary per 
week for all departments on 
the undergraduate level was 
$78. The high was in the de­
partment of Civil Engineering 
which proved to be $105 per 
week. The low was Home Eco­
nomics with an average weekly 
salary of $51. Sixty-one percent 
of the students employed had 
summer jobs related directly to 
their interests. Significant also 
in the fact that only 28 percent 
of those responding to the poll 
had used the placements office 
in attempt to find summer jobs. 
Of those, 31 percent got jobs 
through placements.
On the graduate level, the 
average weekly salary for sum­
mer employment was $164, the 
high being for graduate stu­
dents in Electrical Engineering 
with $189 per week.
Suggestions Useful
There were many good 
suggestions to improve the 
bureau’s summer job program. 
Most recommended better 
communication: feedback on 
applications submitted to the 
bureau, more information 
posted on campus, and perhaps 
the printing of a pamphlet out­
lining what is available, and 
how to go about applying. Oth­
ers urged the listing of jobs in 
wider geographic areas, and 
jobs of a general nature which 
do not require specific skills.
Still others, however, wanted 
more jobs which would relate to 
their fields of interest. A strong 
cry was registered by those in 
the college of Fine Arts that not 
enough jobs are available to 
them in their areas of endeavor. 
Another general complaint was 
the procedure presently em­
ployed in filing the information 
on summer jobs.
Seventy-two percent of 
the students wanted more 
information in The Tartan on 
summer jobs. In response to 
this The Tartan has agreed to 
publish frequently a bulletin on 
the state of summer and per­
manent jobs available and how 
to apply for them.
Further information will be' 
given on summer employment 
today at 3:30 p.m. in the Wher- 
rett Room in SJcibo when the 
bureau holds an information 
session for summer jobs. At that 
time some of the complaints 
raised will be answered.

The biggest thing in Amer­
ican education during this 
decade, according to one top 
Mellon Institute administra­
tor, is the proposed merger 
of his institution with Car­
negie Tech. “It is the best 
combination of facilities,” 
says Charles Willingham, 
Mellon’s head of professional 
relations. He goes on to say 
that the institute might have 
chosen instead to maintain 
itself as a “scientific apart­
ment house” or established a 
third university in the Oak­
land community.
Early in its history, Mellon 
Institute was the Mellon In­
stitute of Industrial Research 
and School of Specific In­
dustries at the University of 
Pittsburgh.
It was born from the idea of 
Dr. Robert Kennedy Duncan 
— the idea that the resources 
and methods of physical sci­
ence could and should be 
applied to the problems of 
industry. In 1911, through 
the influence and financial 
support of brothers Andrew 
W. and Richard B. Mellon, 
Dr. Duncan was called to the 
University of Pittsburgh to 
establish a department of in­
dustrial research.
The Institute continued 
its activities as a part of the 
university until 1927, when it 
was incorporated as the Mel­
lon Institute of Industrial Re­
search (later shortened to the 
Mellon Institute). Since that 
time it has operated closely 
with both the university and 
Carnegie Tech.
With regard to the nature 
of staff organization after a 
merger, Willingham pointed 
to existent joint appoint­
ments.
He explained that the Mel­
lon Fellows might expect to 
do more teaching. “We have 
specialists who do not teach 
who might inherently want 
to teach in areas not covered 
by the present university 
staff.
And the university profes­
sors might find the institute a 
place to consult and collabo­
rate.”
But many technical prob­
lems of re-organization have 
not yet been solved. Accord­
ing to Paul C. Cross, Mellon’s 
president and chief execu­
tive officer, the questions are 
still being accumulated by 
both Carnegie Tech and the 
Institute. Before they are 
answered, no further an­
nouncement of a merger will 
be made.

From its inception in 1954, 
WQED has been broadcasting 
from the old Holland Mansion in 
Oakland, across the street from 
Mellon Institute. This building is 
now “obsolete and totally inade­
quate for the educational station’s 
local programming, as well as its 
function as one of the nation’s 
key production centers in educa­
tional broadcasting.” (WQED is 
a member of NET, the National 
Educational Television Network.)
Paul Schweikher, head of the 
Architecture Department at 
Tech, designed an addition to 
the Holland Mansion, but sta­
tion authorities finally concluded 
a move was necessary. Several 
sites were considered, one near 
Chatham College and another in 
Schenley Park near Forbes Field.
Early this summer, Carnegie 
Tech offered WQED the ground 
on which Colonial Manor now 
stands. The new WQED building 
will contain nearly 60,000 usable 
square feet of space, and construc­
tion costs will be $1,500,000. 
New broadcasting equipment 
which will enable full color tele­
vision will be purchased at a cost 
of $1,250,000.
Funds for this project are being 
provided by a grant of $1,500,000 
from the Richard King Mellon 
Charitable Trusts, matching funds 
from the Ford Foundation, and 
local corporate and foundation 
grants totaling $1,500,000 from 
the WQED capital campaign.

WQED, the first community- 
supported educational television 
station in the country, will be 
broadcasting from the Carnegie 
Tech campus by June of 1968. 
Colonial Manor Apartments, the 
“honor” housing unit for upper- 
class women, will be torn down 
next summer to make way for 
WQED studios and facilities.
Donald V. Taverner, president 
of Metropolitan Pittsburgh Edu­
cational Television, says, “The 
site ideally meets our require­
ments. We feel strongly the need 
to be located in Oakland, the cul­
tural center of the city, with easy 
access to public transportation, 
and in a position easily visible to 
the general public.
“While this move will in no way 
affect our operation as a commu­
nity educational television station 
serving metropolitan Pittsburgh, 
we do look forward to close co­
operation with Carnegie Tech 
in many areas of programming, 
instruction, and educational op­
portunities.”
Tech President H. Guyford Ste- 
'ver says, “Carnegie Tech has not 
been involved in educational tele­
vision as much as it should.”
‘One of the Best’
Stever calls WQED “one of the 
best educational stations in the
country,” and said, “In making 
this land available we think we 
will contribute significantly to 
the future growth of this fine in­
stitution.”
‘Tentative plans,” he added, 
“call for the development of our 
Dramatic Arts Center on land 
adjacent to the new WQED site. 
The proximity of the station will 
greatly enhance our drama stu­
dents’ opportunities in television 
direction and production and 
will also provide the potential for 
the development of educational 
visual aids, a field in which our 
faculty has great interest.”
Earle R. Gister, head of the 
Drama Department, had no im- 
mediate comment.
In announcing the WQED plans 
last Wednesday in the Wherret 
Room, Dr. Stever said that when 
the Dramatic Arts Center is to 
be built depends on when funds 
can be raised. Stever was also 
questioned about the implica­
tions of the station’s presence for 
non-Arts students, such as the 
possibility of instituting curricula 
in communication sciences. He 
answered that such a program 
“can’t be forced—it has to grow” 
from the interests and initia­
tive of professors and students. 
Last Wednesday in the Wherrett 
he cited the example of station 
WGBH in Massachusetts, which 
works closely with students from 
MIT.
Plant Now Inadequate
Grades governed by new policy
Author Unknown
Published Sept. 15,1966
There has been some consis­
tency in the past regarding the 
use of I and X grades. An I grade 
is given when circumstances be­
yond the student’s control (such 
as illness) prevents him from 
completing his course work. 
Once the course work is com­
pleted, the I grade can be raised 
to whatever grade the instructor 
deems appropriate.
An X grade represents a con­
ditional failure of such a nature 
that the student will be given an 
opportunity to bring his work up 
to passing level without repeat­
ing the course. An X grade may 
be raised only to a D grade.
I andXgrades must be removed 
from the student’s transcripts 
by the end of the following se­
mester. To ensure removal of 
I and X grades in the future, 
the following procedure will 
be adopted on a campus-wide 
basis:
¦1ft
When an I or X grade is sub­
mitted to the registrar, it must be 
accompanied by a carbon copy of 
a memorandum addressed to the 
dean of the division in which the 
student enrolled.
This memo must be signed by 
the instructor giving the condi­
tional grade and contersigned by 
his department head and clearly 
indicate why the grade is being 
given and what must be done on 
the part of the student to remove 
it. Unless the instructor further 
explains why the student cannot 
satisfy these requirements be­
fore the end of the next semester 
he is in attendance, the grade 
will automatically revert to an 
R at that time if no change-of- 
grade card is submitted.
The registrar will provide 
lists of students who have I and 
X grades, and these will be sent 
to department heads shortly be­
fore grading periods to remind 
instructors that change-of-grade 
cards are returned for all stu­
dents receiving I and X, includ­
ing those who should receive R.

Students’ ideas are being solicited as part 
of the planning for the new College of Hu­
manities and Social Sciences at Carnegie 
University.
Dr. Erwin R. Steinberg, Dean of Margaret 
Morrison Carnegie College and Dean of the 
Division of Humanities and Social Sciences, 
requests that any students with ideas on the 
formation of the proposed liberal arts col­
lege write them out and leave them in his 
office, Margaret Morrison 107, or send them 
through campus mail.'
Steinberg says, “It is important for the stu­
dent to think through his relationship with 
the university (especially since a new univer­
sity is being planned) and understand what 
it means to be a student, what other students 
in other universities are doing, and what the 
student’s role is in a university.”
Carnegie Tech now has a college of liberal 
arts and social science for women only, Mar­
garet Morrison, and a non-degree-granting 
Division of Humanities and Social Science 
for Engineering and Science students. The 
structures and purposes of both Margaret 
Morrison and the division of H&SS will have 
<
to be redefined when a coeducational, de­
gree-granting liberal arts college is instituted 
at Carnegie University.
The Humanities and Social Sciences faculty 
has had a series of departmental meetings to 
define departmental positions on the new 
college.
Mass meetings of Margaret Morrison fac­
ulty and H&SS faculty are currently being 
held to define and explore problems concern­
ing the liberal arts school.
One of the chief problems to be explored is 
a “core program” for the new college — a cen­
tral set of courses to be offered. Other topics 
for discussion are how other branches of 
the university would contribute to this core 
program and how other branches would be 
served by the core program.
These problems were posed in a memo 
issued earlier this month by Dr. A. Leslie Der- 
fer, history professor and chairman of the 
H&SS faculty.
The English Department is considering 
questions on the new college such as: “What 
emphasis is to be placed on professional 
education? What is meant by a liberal- 
professional education? Is the traditional 
departmental major the best way of achiev­
ing a liberal education?
“Should the humanities be linked with the
A
social sciences or with the pure sciences? 
What is to be the role of teacher training in 
shaping the educational program in English? 
What is to be the character of the graduate 
program?”
Carnegie Tech’s board of trustees will meet 
in January to review tentative plans for Car­
negie University.
There should be definite, substantial news 
on the H&SS college before this meeting; ac­
cording to Edward R. Schatz, vice-president 
for Academic Affairs.
Schatz says Carnegie Tech and Mellon In­
stitute will hopefully be legally merged by 
July 1, 1967. Tech will then be a University 
“in the legal sense.”
The first male freshman in Humanities 
and Social Sciences should enter in the fall 
of 1968.
Several men in the mathematics and phys­
ics are currently taking “double majors” and 
will graduate with English degrees as well as 
scientific degrees.
Also, freshmen and sophomore men in E 
and S or Fine Arts can, with approval from 
their dean, transfer to the English Depart­
ment and obtain an English degree from the 
Division of Humanities and Social Sciences.

During this semester, Nerd 
News, put out by five fresh­
men, has caused much com­
ment on campus. Copies are 
distributed every Wednesday to 
various places including Skibo 
Information Desk, the Hill 
dorms, and Doherty Hall.
The first issue appeared on 
Sept. 28. The Nerd of the Week 
(NOW) spotlighted in this issue 
was Joseph Csonka, the room­
mate of Paul Chidester, who, 
along with Rich Freda, came up 
with the idea of publishing Nerd 
News. They arrived at the idea 
while trying to find a way to 
publicize the good grades and 
study habits of Csonka. Along 
with Chidester and Freda, 
three other students, Mark 
Poland, Phil Gacka, and Bob 
Cunkleman, serve as editors of 
the Nerd News.
Each week, Nerd News con­
tains numerous items such as a 
list of outstanding NOW nomi­
nees for that week and articles 
related to some facet of nerding 
or the Nerd News itself.
Besides having to establish 
the proper spelling of nerd, 
the editors have run into two 
problems. The first is a lack of 
nominations. Few nominations 
are received, and often nomina­
tions are too vague to be useful. 
Also, virtually all nominees have 
been male CIT-MIS students. 
The editors are not happy about 
this. They stress that they want 
to include everyone: women, 
blacks, Fine Arts, and H&SS stu­
dents in the Nerd News.
The second problem is finan­
cial. So far, the editors have put 
out the Nerd News using their 
own money and donations from 
other people. Their funds are 
starting to run low now, how­
ever. To solve this problem, they 
plan to seek recognition from 
Student Senate as a student 
organization.
The editors say they will con­
tinue to publish “for the long- 
deserved and -awaited recogni­
tion of those who dedicate their 
lives to ‘good nerdage’” every 
week until their funds run out.
Sweepstakes shaping up in practice
A member of Sigma Nu pushes the fraternity’s buggy during practice.
by Gordon Morrison
Published March 29,1977
Most people do not under­
stand the amount of practice 
and work that goes into mak­
ing Sweepstakes one of the most 
exciting events of Spring Carnival. 
After all, what else could get 
someone from CMU up at that 
early hour year after year? (Good 
news this year. Since there is no 
conflict with the flower show at 
Phipps Conservatory, the buggy 
races will be at 9 a.m.)
Most of the buggy push teams 
start practicing with the buggy 
around March 1, and that does 
not mean the first practice is 
then. The pushers want to be 
in good shape before that very 
first push of the buggy. It is bad 
enough that you have to sprint up 
the hill by yourself, but you also 
have to take the buggy with you. 
People who have never pushed a 
buggy say that the buggy is sup­
posed to roll well, and that it can­
not take much to push the buggy 
up the hill. Even if the buggy does 
roll well, it still weighs nearly 200 
pounds, and that makes quite a 
difference.
The push team is not the only 
group out practicing. The driv­
er (the one you never see who 
is actually in the buggy) has to 
get to know the race course and 
buggy, as well as each pusher. 
Each pusher pushes differently, 
and even a little difference is 
noticeable to a driver. Besides 
practicing, each driver has a full 
year of eating to diet off by the 
race day. Since pushers are gen­
erally twice the size of the driv­
ers, the driver has no problem 
of willpower. Every pound that a 
driver loses, the pusher does not 
have to push.
Then there is the crew that 
works on the buggy to make any 
possible adjustment to make the 
buggy even one-tenth of a second 
faster. Change this, oil this differ­
ently, heat this, and anything else 
someone can possibly imagine.
Try it at free roll practice this 
weekend, happening at dawn. 
Then the crew practices every­
thing and times all the things 
that need to be done on race day, 
so that everything will be done 
exactly at the right time. Not too 
early or too late.
Then, you have the guys who 
have to go out at 3:30 a.m. to 
sweep the course clean of debris 
and rocks, so that the course will 
be safe for the drivers. There are 
also numerous flag people to stop 
traffic on the course, and to tell the 
driver when to make the turn past 
Phipps going up to Scaife Hall, 
commonly known as the chute.
To keep everything running 
smoothly, there is a buggy chair­
person from each organization 
that will get together with all the 
other chairpeople at the frequent 
meetings. Presiding over these 
chairpeople is a Sweepstakes 
Chairperson, Safety Chairperson, 
and others. There is also a group 
of people that will judge the 
buggy for design before the race.
CMU closing explained
by Robin Mager
Published Feb. 9, 1977
According to the Director of 
Physical Plant, William Banks, 
CMU was forced to close its facil­
ities on Friday afternoon, Jan. 
28, and last Monday morning 
because a blizzard was expected 
and because of the inaccessibil­
ity of fuel.
Though the snowstorm was 
not as severe as anticipated, the 
temperature dropped well below 
freezing. It was this temperature 
drop that caused the state gov­
ernment to urge the Bellefield 
Boiler Plant to reduce its gas 
consumption by 33%.
Bellefield Boiler burns both 
coal and natural gas and while 
there may have been enough 
coal available to keep campus 
facilities going, there would not 
have been enough fuel to supply 
Bellefield’s other customers.
An increased consumption of 
coal could have created two more 
problems: a short supply of coal 
and more pollution. Normally, 
the university has enough coal 
for ten days at a time, but the 
cold weather has frozen some
of the machinery of Bellefield’s 
coal supplier, Champion Mines. 
Increased consumption would 
have led to an even greater 
scarcity of fuel. In addition, the 
burning of coal would have pro­
duced more pollutants than the 
burning of gas.
Heat was reduced in all class­
room buildings and in Skibo, 
and the kilns and glass-blowing 
furnaces were shut off altogeth­
er. They will remain off until the 
situation has improved.
Heat in dormitories and fra­
ternity houses is not supplied by 
Bellefield Boiler but by Peoples’ 
Gas Co.
The university has not been 
affected by the fuel shortage in 
the way that other institutions 
have because fuel is delivered to 
the Bellefield plant by rail rather 
than by water and because it 
is a private institution which is 
not obligated to comply with 
the requests of the government 
in the same way that state-run 
institutions are.
While there is fuel, its supply 
is not necessarily indefinite and 
as long as the area is in the grip 
of harsh weather another shut­
down could become necessary.

The Career Perspective Series 
is sponsored by the Placement 
Office and is designed to pro­
vide important information on 
employment through its many 
lectures and guest speakers.
Last month a lecture was held 
on interviewing, in which stu­
dents were taught the procedure 
and importance in having a good 
interview when seeking employ­
ment. Attendance was good for 
this first lecture of the series and 
it is expected that students will 
also respond well to the rest of 
the series.
Ryan appeared most optimistic 
about the job situation and thinks 
that as time goes by, students 
will find themselves more content 
with the jobs that they find. He 
believes that as confidence in the 
economy is restored, employers 
will be less cautious in their hir­
ing and that the future of CMU 
graduates looks bright.

Published Oct. 12, 1976
With 75% of last year’s gradu­
ating class accounted for, 68% are 
working, 28% are continuing their 
education in graduate school, and 
4% are presently unemployed, 
according to Jay Ryan, director of 
placement at CMU. These figures 
clearly indicate an improvement 
in CMU graduates who are work­
ing over the class of 1975. With 
77% of the 1975 graduating class 
accounted for, 45% are employed, 
30% are continuing their educa­
tion in graduate school, and 25% 
are unemployed.
Ryan believes that students in 
electrical engineering probably 
have the brightest prospect for 
employment upon graduating 
from CMU. Many of last year’s 
engineers are now employed 
by large corporations, such as
y
Dupont, Eastman Kodak, and 
IBM, and can look forward to a 
good job market. On the other 
hand, students in H&SS are more 
likely not to be able to find work 
when they graduate from CMU. 
Statistics seem to verify the fact 
that a undergraduate degree is not 
enough to land a long term, high- 
paying job for H&SS students.
The Placement Office, located 
in the basement of Warner Hall, is 
encouraging students who will be 
facing the job market to come in 
to receive individual counseling.
At the Placement Office, stu­
dents are assigned to a counsel­
or who works with them on an 
individual basis to find out the 
student’s career interests and 
goals. According to Ryan, the func­
tion of the Placement Office is not 
to direcdy find a job for a student, 
but to provide information and the 
means by which the student is able 
to find a job for himself.

Greek Sing ’87 was held last Friday at Carnegie Music Hall in Oakland. As always, the participating frater­
nities and sororities provided a full night of entertainment for the crowd. Greek Sing/Swing co-chairs Tedd 
Tomczyk and Paula Johnson opened the show and kept it rolling in between acts. Each year the proceeds 
of Greek Sing go to a different charity. Greek Sing ’87 will donate the night’s profits to the Myasthenia

extending thanks to Carnegie Mellon’s Interfraternity Council for the generous contribution.
Student Senate reinstates funding for publication The Student Union
by Kevin Poecking
Staffwriter
Published March 17, 1987
Members of The Student 
Union turned out in full force 
last Tuesday night at the Senate 
meeting in hopes of having their 
funding unfrozen.
Senator Norman Larsen 
motioned to reinstate The Union’s 
temporarily suspended funding. 
The motion included that the 
union pay The New York Times for 
an article it copied and re-print­
ed without permission in the Feb. 
25 issue.
In addition to the copyright 
violation, Senator David Lewis 
pointed out that a reporter for 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, Jim 
McKay, could file for libel against 
The Union. McKay was included 
in the “Interview: SEIU Workers” 
article in the same issue of The 
Union.
In a letter to both senators and 
the audience, Lewis claimed, 
“The interview implies that Mr. 
McKay allowed Carnegie Mellon 
to stop him from printing an
article critical of CMU, which is 
strongly against journalistic eth­
ics.”
He concluded that The Union 
did not directly state this, but 
“did re-publish the potentially 
discriminatory statement.”
Lewis proposed an amend­
ment to the motion requiring The 
Union to get a written agreement 
from McKay dropping all claims 
to a suit.
“Since The Student Union is 
a funded, service organization, 
their assets include the student 
activities fee. Therefore, any
amount of the student activi­
ties fee, regardless of the budget 
of The Student Union, could be 
taken as payment for damages,” 
Lewis said.
Union representative Treva 
Fornby argued that McKay had 
already been contacted, and he 
does not intend to file a suit. The 
amendment was rejected and the 
original motion passed without 
objection.
Senator Larson then moved 
that the Student Senate extend a 
written executive apology to The 
Union for Senate’s actions prior
to the suspension of The Union’s 
funds.
Senators objected that they 
have the right to suspend the 
funds of any organization if that 
organization’s actions endafiger 
the assets of the activities fee. 
Opposing senators argued that 
The Union had not beeri contact­
ed before the meeting and could 
not be represented to defend the 
claims against it.
Senator Tamal Mukherjee 
claimed, that in the future, there 
will be a liason between The Union 
and Senate who can be contacted
if similar actions should occur. 
The motion passed 13-7.
Senator Allen Greenberg 
moved to grant retroactive funds 
to pay for The Union’s March 9 
issue which has been paid out-of- 
pocket by The Union staff.
Another amendment to the 
motion was made that would 
require The Union to print a 
retraction stating that the last 
issue was funded by the student 
activities fee.
This was accepted as a friendly 
amendment and passed with the 
motion.
Business Opportunities Conference - What it is, why it is
by Eric W. Leuliette
Staffwriter
Published Oct. 7, 1986
“We’re taking charge of our 
careers,” comments Roger 
Aguinaldo, chairman of the first 
annual Business Opportunities 
Conference (BOC). The confer­
ence is scheduled for Nov. 17, 
1986, from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
Organized and run by stu­
dents, the conference will bring 
companies to campus and offer 
opportunities to students who 
choose to attend or organize the 
BOC.
The first BOC was created 
by IM majors who have seen 
five Technical Opportunity 
Conferences organized by engi­
neering students.
“We know we are being trained 
in management, so if those engi­
neers can put on an excellent 
conference, why shouldn’t we?”
asked Aguinaldo.
Aguinaldo characterizes the 
BOC as more aggressive than the 
TOC.“We have more of a business 
sense,” he says.
Unable to obtain funds from the 
Student Senate, the Association 
of Industrial Management and 
Economics (AIME) obtained 
“monetary and mental support” 
from the deans of GSIA, nota­
bly Dean Elizabeth Bailey and 
Associate Dean Tim McGuire. 
AIME began planning the confer­
ence earlier this year with several 
loosely structured brainstorming 
meetings.
Aguinaldo and Director of 
Corporate Matters John P. Jones 
expect representatives from 
Procter & Gamble, Morgan 
Guarantee, American Express, 
Chase Manhattan, Citibank, E. F. 
Hutton, Mellon Bank, and Merrill 
Lynch to attend the conference. 
Though the committee organiz­
ing the conference has set a goal
of convincing 40 corporations to 
attend, it was not disappointed 
to learn that only seven repre­
sentatives had made concrete 
reservations by last Thursday. 
The conference has already had 
some success: Several companies 
have arranged interviews through 
career services and placement for 
the first time.
The Business Opportunities 
Conference has several purposes. 
First, it will promote the differ­
ence between CMU’s industrial 
education and other universities’ 
programs.
“Our education is in manage­
ment as well as in business,” 
explains Aguinaldo. “That puts 
people ahead of just business.”
In addition to letting com­
panies get to know CMU, the 
BOC has a more personal side. 
Students, especially sophomores 
and juniors, can get to know the 
corporate representatives well.

Hamerschlag: Disgrace and pride of CMU campus
by Kevin Kim
Staffwriter
Published Sept. 10, 1986
Every place must have its 
downfalls. Baseball has the 
Pirates. Football has the USFL, 
Ohio has Cleveland, the United 
States had New Jersey, and CMU 
has Hamerschlag House. Yes, the 
wonderful ’Schlag, where would 
we be without it? The prison- 
style, cinder block walls enhance 
’Schlag’s special atmosphere. In 
angling the rooms, the architect 
has maximized the discomfort 
and minimized the space. But 
look on the bright side: Next-year 
the cinder-block walls may actu­
ally get covered with plaster, fol­
lowed by new carpeting replacing 
the shredded fabric on the floors. 
The new residents of the ’Schlag 
have become so overwhelmed by 
their rooms as to forsake them 
and live in the lounge. Yes, unde­
niably, Hamerschlag is the armpit 
of the school. It’s even begun to 
take on the aspects of an uncared 
armpit: a nauseating odor and a 
steamy, humid atmosphere.
Armpits. What’s so bad about 
armpits? To put it in a nut shell,
they smell and sweat. Armpits 
cause extreme discomfort for their 
owners and the people associat­
ing with them. At inconvenient 
times, armpits can cause extreme 
embarrassment and humiliation. 
Armpits cause so much grief, their 
owners should have their armpits 
surgically removed.
Like armpits, the ’Schlag smells. 
This is not the fault of the custodi­
al staff; the ’Schlag just possesses 
a special, individual personality. 
The ’Schlag has caused extreme 
discomfort with its residents and 
visitors. I’m quite sure that the 
Housing Office and the admin­
istration don’t take great pride 
in Hamerschlag House. Despite 
what other dorm residents say, 
Hamerschlag is the armpit of the 
school and should be permanent­
ly removed from campus. Perhaps 
another college in the area will 
want it.
Armpits. What’s so good about 
armpits? To think about it, there 
are quite a few good deeds arm­
pits have done for society. If it 
wasn’t for armpits, where would 
you put your deodorant? Think 
about it. A world without arm­
pits is a world without deodorant. 
Thousands of deodorant-related
jobs would no longer exist. Where 
would deodorant soaps go? The 
entire ideal of an individualized 
smell would be replaced with the 
concept of the uniform odor of 
society. The very ideal is com­
munist in thought; the American 
ideology is threatened. A million 
dollar industry would collapse; 
thousands of people would be 
unemployed, living on the streets 
if armpits didn’t smell and sweat. 
That’s impressive, but there’s 
more.
Flap your arms up and down. 
First make sure no one’s watch­
ing, then flap your arms. Pretty 
simple, right? Thank your arm­
pits. Yes, due to the wonderful 
work of evolution and a little 
heredity, you can move your arms 
at the shoulder.
If you had a mound instead of 
a pit under your shoulder, your 
arms would be sticking straight 
out or straight up. How much 
are you willing to pay for this 
flexibility? A hundred dollars? A 
thousand? Believe it or not, you 
received this fantastic ability for 
free. You were born with it. What 
more could you ask?
The ’Schlag serves a greater 
purpose than to make its inhab-
to copy some of the success of 
the Technical Opportunities 
Conference. Over the TOC’s five- 
year history, three students have 
received firm job offers on the 
floor of the conference. Several 
companies have called the TOC 
later, offering placement for 
especially the conference’s orga­
nizers. According to Aguinaldo, 
a major reason to join is to open 
up excellent business contacts 
while fine-tuning one’s career 
goals.
Finally, John P. Jones hopes 
for “a wider campus awareness 
of what we’re [the BOC] doing.”
Both Jones and Aguinaldo 
agree that CSLA. and IM are 
closely linked, but they wish to 
make a separate name for IM, 
somewhat independent of the 
graduate school. For now, the 
organizers are attempting to 
build a reputation.
“We can only go up,” sums up 
Aguinaldo.
itants miserable. The ’Schlag 
allows Housing to dump those 
who are late with housing 
forms into a dorm. It is the first 
step to telling young freshmen 
that life doesn’t always serve 
the best, and worse things are 
yet to come.
Perhaps the ’Schlag doesn’t 
offer total flexibility to inhab­
itants, but in university hous­
ing, one must follow university 
rules. The ’Schlag serves many 
needs, but not all of those for 
its residents.
I guess it comes to the neces­
sity of armpits. Sure they can 
cause discomfort and embar­
rassment, but isn’t the price 
employing thousands, differ­
entiating capitalist belief being 
able to move our arms at the 
shoulder worth the cost?
The world needs armpits. It 
all boils down to that simple 
fact. Ohio wouldn’t be the 
same without Cleveland, base­
ball without the Pirates, or the 
United States without New 
Jersey.
Overall, we need the armpits 
of the world. As long as this is 
true, I guess CMU will always 
have the ’Schlag.

How Carnegie Mellon parking 
works
by David Sokolow
Published Jan. 13, 1987
Picture this scenario: After 
three summers of back-breaking 
manual labor, you have finally 
earned enough money to buy 
the car of your dreams. You bring 
your 1975 Firebird with the T-top 
roof, 5-speed manual transmis­
sion and black, rear spoiler back 
to school with you. Not being 
one of the lucky 300 undergrad­
uates, you do not get a CMU 
parking permit and are forced 
to park illegally wherever you 
can find a spot. You have gotten 
at least three tickets and have 
blown them all off. It’s Friday 
night and you have a hot date 
with someone in your English 
class. Running late, you dash to 
your car, hop in, and floor it. But 
wait, your wheels grind in place 
but do not move! You’ve been 
booted!
Why is this mustard-colored 
wheel lock necessary at all on a 
campus where a five-digit tuition 
should preclude most students 
from ever hoping to own cars 
while still in school?
Because “none of the students 
want to walk; everyone wants to 
drive,” says Sylvia Austin, park­
ing coordinator.
It’s hardly a secret to anyone 
that Carnegie Mellon suffers 
from a severe lack of parking 
space. According to Austin’s cal­
culations, there are just under 
1500 spots for faculty, staff, and 
students to fight for.
“Spots used to be awarded on 
the point system but now are by 
seniority,” Austin said.
Full professors are at the top 
of the highest category, while 
freshmen are at the bottom of 
the lowest category.
Is it fair, though, that unless 
one goes Greek, his or her chanc­
es of procuring a parking permit 
while still in school at Carnegie 
Mellon are practically nil? Austin 
affirms that the system is as fair 
as it can possibly be.
Students who are unable to 
obtain parking permits are not 
the only victims of the current 
parking system. Several students 
with legitimate permits — partic­
ularly fraternity members — are 
also penalized for infractions of 
campus parking rules. Recently, 
the university has hired an addi­
tional traffic controller, doubling 
the enforcement manpower to 
two.
To shed the myth that noth­
ing can happen to a student 
who doesn’t pay his citations, 
consider that any motor vehicle 
with three or more tickets “can 
be wheel locked.” The price of 
having your wheels unlocked 
is $5 plus all unpaid fees. Your 
vehicle will only be towed when 
it poses a safety hazard or when 
it prevents a permit holder from 
finding a spot. If you find your 
car is not where you parked it, 
however, before you file a stolen 
car report, you might want to 
take $55 with you and check out 
Craig Towing on Fifth Avenue — 
just in case.
“It takes a lot of money to 
cover all the necessary costs 
of the smooth operation of the 
parking office,” Austin said.
Will flagrant permit-parking 
offenders buy this argument? 
Probably not, but a mustard-col­
ored wheel lock might be a little 
more persuasive.
And if it’s not, a lot more peo­
ple will probably find out what 
it’s like to take a date out on a 
Friday night via the PAT Transit 
System.

The opening today of the 
Carnegie Mellon campus network 
is the culmination of a dream that 
I have held for six years. With 
the advent of microcomputers, 
I envisaged a situation in which 
each student, each faculty mem­
ber, and most staff members had 
access to a computer system that 
would be connected together.
I saw such a system as an alter­
native to time-sharing. It was 
obvious to me after many years of 
living with a time-sharing system 
that it was not the right system 
for a university. Time-sharing 
works only with restrictions on 
the number of users. It was so 
clear that we needed a commer­
cial partner to complete such a 
job and that there were commer­
cial possibilities in the concept of 
the network.
I was pleased, therefore, when 
IBM indicated a strong interest 
in the project. Our first joint task 
was to determine the feasibility 
of a network that might have as 
many as 10,000 computers on it. 
At that time, in January of 1982, 
it was not clear that one could
develop such a network nor was 
the software available to run the 
network if it were a feasible proj­
ect.
So, all during the winter of 
1982, a task force diligently 
explored the limits of our knowl­
edge to determine the possibility 
of bringing the network I dreamed 
of to reality. By May of 1982, the 
committee had determined the 
feasibility, and we had meetings 
in Armonk and Pittsburgh to go 
over the report.
Then, a feeling of elation swept 
all of us who had been involved in 
the project. We recognized that 
the network had passed the feasi­
bility tests and taken a major step 
forward in becoming a reality.
The Information Technology 
Center (ITC) was formèd as the 
mechanism for developing the 
software and planning for the 
proposed network. The Center 
consisted of 30 people, 10 of 
whom were from IBM and 20 
who were hired by Carnegie 
Mellon.
The project got a tremendous 
lift when Jim Morris agreed to 
become the head of the ITC and 
assumed the leadership of the 
development of thé network. 
Jim hired the other 20 people to 
make the ITC a
nization. IBM agreed to make 
a contribution for financing the 
ITC, and the project began to 
swing into high gear.
The two organizations had to 
work closely together to complete 
this project. It is truly an amazing 
accomplishment in my view for a 
business firm and a university to 
have accomplished this task in 
four years.
In the process, personnel from 
the two organizations have got­
ten to know each other. During 
the whole four years, we have 
maintained quarterly meetings to 
measure the progress of the proj­
ect and to assess the problems 
that we had outstanding. It took 
real determination and a great 
desire to achieve our objectives 
that carried us all forward.
The establishment of the net­
work accomplishes two major 
objectives: (1) it does give an 
alternative computer system to 
conventional time-sharing and 
(2) it eliminates the terrible 
problems that we have men­
tioned and all understand about 
time-sharing.
So that if nothing else were 
accomplished, we have estab­
lished a major alternative for 
universities and business organi­
zations for a computer system.

Faculty move into new research facility
by Meena Vagner
Tartan Staffwriter 
Published Feb. 24, 1997
The second and third floors 
of Roberts Hall were completed 
this past Wednesday, and faculty 
are moving into their offices. 
The rest of the construction is 
expected to be completed by 
April 1. When completed, the 
first floor will have offices and a 
conference room.
Construction began on the 
new building, between Hamer- 
schlag Hall and Neville Street, 
early in the spring of 1995. The 
construction of Roberts Hall was 
quite a task, according to Project 
Manager Peg Hart.
After shutting down Neville 
Street so that the crew could 
get access to the building, Hart 
commented that “getting the 
supplies down the dirt road was 
very hard and there was no other 
way to get to the building.”
Roberts Hall is accessible from 
Hamerschlag Hall B level, and 
there will be a tunnel connect­
ing the first floor to Hamerschlag 
Hall D level. Hart said that the 
building will mainly be used 
by the faculty and graduate 
students of the electrical and 
computer engineering depart­
ment, with some space allotted
to the chemical engineering 
department.
Roberts is equipped with 
breakrooms, restrooms, wash 
rooms, one elevator, and is 
handicap accessible. It is named 
after the major contributor and 
material scientist and graduate 
of Carnegie Institute of Technol­
ogy, George Roberts.
The building was designed by 
the firm of Payette Associates, 
whose key member on this proj­
ect was also a CMU graduate, 
George Marsh.
The basement will be occu­
pied by offices. The first floor 
will have offices and labs, and 
currently the second and third 
floors have offices occupied and 
labs which are being completed 
for use.
The fourth floor, which is not 
fully completed yet, will have 
various purposes. It will have a 
multiple-purpose/conference 
room which will primarily be 
used for seminars and meetings. 
The fourth floor will also have a 
library, to which George Roberts 
will be donating his personal 
library.
The completion of Roberts 
will give the university’s CIT fac­
ulty and graduates more space 
to conduct experiments and re­
search projects and will serve as 
a hub for CIT.
Fifth Year Scholar Program 
honors exceptional seniors
Now I know that most CMU 
students are about as up-to- 
date on the news as a Tibetan 
monk, but I think I would 
probably be justified in as­
suming that you’ve all heard 
about the current situation 
with Iraq. A few weeks ago, 
the U.S. launched a cruise- 
missile attack against Iraq and 
expanded the “no- fly zone.” 
Saddam Hussein thumped his 
chest a bit about this and just 
let it M while his Kurd cronies, 
supported by his own troops, 
stamped out the U.S.-sup­
ported Kurdish rebels.
The media initially reported 
the great U.S. success against 
Iraq and how we’re helping out 
the poor Kurds. Well, that isn’t 
quite the whole truth. Then 
again, I’ve learned to look a bit 
more deeply than the surface 
of news reports if I really want 
to know the facts.
Let me give you the low- 
down. The Clinton adminis­
tration, in another of its series 
of foreign policy blunders, 
decided to support a certain 
band of Kurdish nationalists, 
with the explicit purpose of 
overthrowing or assassinat­
ing Saddam Hussein. Now 
this sounds pretty good in 
theory, right? Well, it might 
have been if they hadn’t cho­
sen a group that was already 
a satellite of Iran. Then, as if 
picking the side supported by 
the only bunch in the Middle 
East worse than Iraq isn’t bad 
enough, we let the other group 
of Kurds, who are supported 
by Hussein, stomp our guys 
out of existence without so 
much as a token bit of support. 
Well, I suppose the cruise mis­
siles fired into southern Iraq, 
even though the Kurds are 
hundreds of miles north, could 
be considered a token.
Anybody heard.of the Bay 
of Pigs? This was a similar 
debacle in which a group of 
Cuban exiles was trained and 
supplied by the U.S. to over­
throw Castro. Of course when 
push came to shove, Kennedy 
backed out of supporting them 
to the hilt, and they got mas­
sacred.
This is exactly what' hap­
pened to these Kurds. We got 
them to trust us and set them 
up to do dirty work that we 
didn’t want to do. Then, when 
things turned bad, we turned 
tail and ran, abandoning our 
erstwhile allies to the grim 
mercies of their sadistic ene­
mies. Boy, I bet that will really 
inspire the world to trust Uncle 
Sam in the future.
Roberts Hall nears completion
Magical orientation welcomes class of 2000 to Carnegie Mellon
by Dan Rosenberg
Tartan Staffwriter 
Published Sept. 3, 1996
There was a sort of magic that 
prevailed throughout this year’s 
freshman Orientation. It wasn’t 
the kind of magic that illusionist 
.Craig Karges performed when he 
placed his palm on an end table 
and caused it to rise above the 
ground. Nor was it the magic of 
Mother Nature, who made sure it 
didn’t rain during any of the out­
door orientation activities. This 
magic is the spirit of the fresh­
men who, during Playfair, came 
into the bleachers to give hugs 
and words of encouragement to 
an injured classmate; the spirit of 
the numerous first-year students 
who checked on the condition 
ofi orientation counselor (OC)
Jennifer Olsen after she fainted 
during Playfair; the spirit that 
caused the entire freshman class 
to break into a chant of “CMU! 
CMU!” following Saturday eve­
ning’s slide presentation. This 
spirit is the magic of the Class of 
2000.
The freshmen and the admin­
istrative orientation staff believe 
that the magic originated from 
the OCs.
Miyuji De-Bruin said it felt 
wonderful to have the OCs say hi 
to her not only throughout orien­
tation week, but also during the 
first week of classes.
“It’s nice to know they care 
about you, and I bet many other 
freshmen feel the same way,” De- 
Bruin said.
“The staff brought out the best 
in tbe class of 2000, and CMU is
a better place because of them,” 
said Kimberly DiDonato, coordi­
nator of Student Life for first-year 
students.
The OCs, however, credit the 
magic to the freshmen.
Rick Yavorsky said, “This is one 
of the best Orientations I’ve ever 
seen, in large part due to the ‘high 
spirits’ of the freshmen class, and 
I’ve been through three.”
Both Yuzo Watanabe and An- 
jana Trivedi believed that a lot 
of the spirit came from the fresh­
men’s desire to be at CMU.
Watanabe, who has been an 
OC for three years, said, “The 
incoming freshmen have been a 
hell of a lot happier than previous 
classes, probably due to the rise 
in applications and a general ‘I 
want to get into CMU’ mentality 
that pervades this class.”
The activities that the fresh­
men spoke most highly of were 
the entertainers, namely Karges; 
comedian Buzz Sutherland; 
musician Jason Caldeira, CMU 
alumnus; and comedy troupe 
Selected Hilarity. In addition to 
Playfair, the freshmen loved the 
Talent Show, the Slide Show, and 
the Clippership Dance Cruise. 
They were not, however, fond of 
meal bracelets and long lines. In 
addition, several students com­
plained of not having enough 
free time.
This year marked the first 
annual Convocation, which Di- 
Donato described as “a kick-off to 
academic life at CMU and a book- 
end to commencement.”
The ceremony consisted of 
presentations by both faculty 
and students including Dean of
Student Affairs Michael Mur­
phy, Student Body President 
Bryon Krug, Student Body Vice 
President Katie Hart, University 
President Robert Mehrabian, and 
Mark Stehlik, assistant dean of 
computer science, who made the 
keynote address.
Also included in the ceremony 
were the presentation of the class 
tile and the reading of a letter 
penned by Andrew Carnegie.
While Orientation did provide 
many hours of enjoyment, it also 
served a very important purpose: 
It allowed the first-year students 
to become acquainted with col­
lege life and with each other.
After speaking to several indi­
viduals, however, there seems to 
be only one word that comes to 
mind to describe the experience: 
magical. t
she presented a proposal to vari­
ous university administrative 
bodies.
The level of administrative in­
terest in MOSAIC was affirmed 
by the fact that every under­
graduate . department but one 
stood alongside Student Affairs, 
Student Life, and the President’s 
Office in supporting the confer­
ence.
The seminars, ranging in top­
ics from women’s spirituality 
to sexual harassment, were led 
by administrators and faculty 
members who had volunteered 
their services.
The organizers were able to 
bring Nancy Hawley, a member 
of the Boston Women’s Health 
Collective, which publishes Our 
Bodies, Ourselves. Hawley fo­
cused on the issue of body image 
and led the 150-strong audience 
in an appraisal of physical self­
perception.
“We definitely want to have 
a conference every year until 
there’s no need for it,” Ullucci 
said.
Having seen her vision come 
to fruition in her last year at 
CMU, Ullucci’s hope now is that 
the effects of MOSAIC will be 
positive and long-lasting.

Carnegie Mellon’s first annual 
conference, on women, MOSAIC, 
was held on Sunday under the 
auspices of the Office of Student 
Life. Attracting over 150 attend­
ees and 25 guest speakers, the 
day-long event marked the first 
time the CMU community has 
formally organized to discuss 
women’s issues.
The impetus for Sunday’s 
event was provided in a large 
part by Kerry Ullucci, senior in 
H&SS, a sexual assault intern in 
the Office of Student Life, and 
conference chair.
“I have been working for Stu­
dent Life for three years now, 
and I’ve been at other confer­
ences in other cities and found 
a great deal of information 
that just wasn’t available here,” 
Ullucci said.
“I also noticed a real sense 
of community at these confer­
ences — something we lack here 
at CMU. I wanted to bring that 
here.”
Ullucci’s vision started to be­
come real last September when
drugs. This course shows that 
it’s much more than that.”
Soultanian is happy with the 
feedback she has gotten from 
students as well as the impact 
her project has had on the com­
munity.
Jill Goodall, another current 
scholar, is a psychology major 
who is focusing her fifth-year 
studies on public relations. For 
her project, Goodall is working 
to improve student activities 
on campus. She contributes to 
event planning workshops, and 
she is developing a web site for 
student activities. In addition, 
she is an AB chair working on 
improving the organization’s 
effectiveness on campus.
Goodall believes her con­
tributions, as well as those of 
other scholars, better the CMU 
community in a number of 
ways.
The program not only gives 
scholars the chance to incor­
porate their projects into uni­
versity life, but it also lets them 
enroll in classes that they did 
not have time to take during 
their undergraduate years.
The scholars are excited 
about the classes they are tak­
ing through the program.
Though their workloads are 
qujte full this year, most schol­
ars do not feel burdened with 
work.
Soultanian said, “It’s more 
work, but I love it. This year is 
both fun and exciting. I put 100 
percent into classes I’m tak­
ing and the one I’m teaching. I 
want everything I do to be the

Donner, Morewood E Tower become hubs for extra students
File Photo

Senior Staffwriter 
Published Sept. 11, 2006
Donner Hall may seem a little crowded 
this semester. The lounges in Morewood 
E Tower may seem even more so. Students 
in temporary housing are no longer living 
off campus. Their living arrangements are 
formally known as temporary housing, 
informally as “temp house.”
For the past three weeks, those in temp 
house have called increased-occupancy 
spaces in Donner Hall and Morewood E Tower 
lounges home. This is a change from previous 
years, in which temp house students lived in 
the Wyndham Garden Hotel until permanent 
on-campus spaces opened up.
“We want to keep people on campus,” said 
Wil Forrest, the associate director of Hous­
ing and Dining Services. “And students have 
said, ‘We would rather be on campus.’ ” For­
rest referred to the choice between living on 
campus in an increased-occupancy space ver­
sus off campus in a hotel.
*‘This was a lot better than if I was in a 
hotel,” said Matt Glantz, a first-year in the 
Tepper School of Business and temp house 
student. Glantz lived in a double that was 
converted to a triple in Donner.
Other temporary housing options in­
cluded triples converted to quads in Donner 
and quints (five-person occupancy) set up in
Morewood E Tower’s student lounges.
Forrest noted that 1430 first-years arrived 
on move-in day, even though admissions 
predicted fewer. In recent years, there have 
been 30 to 50 temporary housing students. In 
some years, there have been as many as 90. 
The number of spaces opening up each fall 
fluctuates depending on how many students 
drop out during the semester, fail to show up 
on the first day, or transfer at the last minute. 
As time goes on, Greek housing and dropouts 
allow for more spaces.
“Frat rush traditionally solves a lot of the 
housing problems,” said Tim Michael, the 
director of Housing and Dining Services. 
“We allow all upperclassmen to retain their 
spaces, and more did that than expected this 
year.”
This year, temporary housing started with
49 students without a place to live. Four More­
wood lounges held five students each. Hous­
ing placed locks on the doors and replaced 
the couches and tables with wardrobes, beds, 
and desks.
Overall, 29 students were placed through­
out Donner, mostly in converted doubles, and 
two in converted triples.
Michael noted that in some cases, students 
decided they wanted to stay in their current 
arrangements for the rest of the year. In these 
cases, Housing provided a reduced rate on 
the room.
While less than five temp house students 
remain in Donner, with one opting to stay for
the semester, the Morewood E Tower lounge 
residents were forced to move out by last Sat­
urday.
“Morewood needs its lounges back,” Mi­
chael said.
Vibhav Sreekanti, a first-year in the School 
of Computer Science, is still living in a triple 
converted to a quad in Donner. He was dis­
pleased with how well Housing and Dining 
kept him informed of the situation.
According to Sreekanti, the e-mail he re­
ceived over the summer regarding his fall 
housing assignment did not mention that he 
was still technically a temp house student 
living in a temporarily increased occupancy 
space.
Jeremy Neuberg, a sophomore in public 
policy and management, lived in the Wynd­
ham last year for several weeks, waiting for a 
spot in campus housing to open. He explained 
that the shuttle for commuting to campus was 
unreliable. Maid service, he said, was also 
scaled back from the typical hotel service.
“I was barely involved in Orientation at all,” 
Neuberg said. Air-conditioning in his room, 
he said, was the highlight of his experience.
Glantz noted that in the future, Housing 
and Dining could improve the situation for 
on-campus temporary housing students fur­
ther by providing air-conditioned rooms for 
increased occupancy rooms.
“Orientation week was unbearable with all 
the extra bodies, furniture, and stuff in the 
small space.”
Tuition skyrockets: Administration explains CMU’s price tag
by
Claire Morgenstern
Assistant News Editor 
Published Nov. 20,2006
Students, parents, faculty, 
and staff gathered in Rangos 
Ballroom for Carnegie Mellon’s 
annual undergraduate tuition 
meeting last Tuesday night. Bill 
Elliott, the university’s vice-presi­
dent for enrollment and the meet­
ing’s host, reported that Carnegie 
Mellon’s tuition surpassed that 
of all its peer institutions for the 
first time this year.
First-year students paid 
$34,578 in tuition and fees, 
compared to this year’s average 
tuition rate among competitors 
of $31,805.
The meeting included pre­
sentations by several notable 
members of the administration, 
each measuring the university’s 
growth in a different way.
Elliott reported on this year’s 
tuition rates and those of our 
peer comparison schools. Provost 
and Senior Vice-President Mark 
Kamlet spoke about Carnegie 
Mellon’s strategic initiatives, 
and Vice-President and Chief 
Financial Officer Deborah Moon 
presented an overview of the uni­
versity’s financial pressures.
This year’s tuition marks an 
increase of nearly 8 percent over 
last year’s rates, Elliott said. 
Over the past 10 years, Carnegie 
Mellon’s tuition rate has increased 
41 percent, compared with 38 
percent among the university’s 
peers.
Carnegie Mellon’s small 
endowment in relation to its peer 
institutions is partly to blame for
File Illustration
this gap, Kamlet explained in 
his presentation titled “Strategic 
Initiatives at Carnegie Mellon.” 
Currently, the market value
of the university’s total endow­
ment is $941 million, whereas 
the average endowment per stu­
dent among peer institutions is
$444,628, Carnegie Mellon’s is 
less than $100,000.
Students and parents pres­
ent at the meeting argued that 
the university’s division into six 
individual colleges often makes 
for a fragmented student body. 
The separation, they said, would 
make alumni more interested in 
contributing to their individual 
colleges and less to the university 
as a whole, leading to a smaller 
endowment.
The reason for ' Carnegie 
Mellon’s comparatively small 
endowment is that it is much 
younger than its peer institu­
tions, Kamlet said.
He said Carnegie Mellon 
can only evaluate its progress 
as a university comparable to 
its peers since 1967, when the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
and the Mellon Institute merged 
to become Carnegie Mellon 
University.
Statistics show the university 
is making the best use of the 
endowment money that it does 
have. U.S. News & World Report 
ranked Carnegie Mellon first in 
endowment efficiency, a measure 
of the school’s performance in 
relation to the size of its endow­
ment. The university’s score was 
more than four times higher than 
that of older universities with 
larger endowments, including 
Harvard, Yale, and Dartmouth.
The university’s endowment 
has grown 31 percent over the 
last three years.
Money received from private 
donors accounts for only 11 per­
cent of this year’s operating rev­
enue. Tuition and fees, on the 
other hand, account for 33 per­
cent of that figure.
Symposium celebrates 
undergraduate research
by Utsab Saha
Junior Staffwriter 
Published April 3, 2007
Carnegie Mellon will be hold­
ing its annual Meeting of the 
Minds, a campus-wide under­
graduate research symposium, 
on Wednesday, May 9. The event 
will take place in the University 
Center from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m.
“This is one of the few times 
when our campus really comes 
together across disciplines, and 
we are able to see and better 
understand what goes on in our 
campus, what intellectual cre­
ativity, artistic creativity, and 
new knowledge is being pro­
duced,” said Stephanie Wallach, 
director of the Undergraduate 
Research Office (URO). “It’s 
important not to belittle the 
impact of these projects,” said 
Ran Lui, a junior Science and 
Humanities Scholar.
Liu encouraged other 
Carnegie Mellon students not 
directly involved in research, 
particularly first-years arid soph­
omores, to attend the Meeting 
of the Minds.
“It’s an extremely valuable 
experience because they can see 
what their options are,” she said. 
“They can see what people are 
doing in other fields. It would 
be a really good way for them to 
plan ahead for what they might 
be interested in doing in the fol­
lowing years.”
Wallach agreed. “It’s very 
inspiring and it makes you very 
proud to be at Carnegie Mellon,
to really see kinds of things tak­
ing place and the level of student 
involvement,” she said. Wallach 
served as a judge for the Meeting 
of the Minds prior to her current 
position at the URO.
'“What’s really amazing about 
this event is that it’s very different 
at Carnegie Mellon than the way a 
lot of other schools do it, because 
we want it as a centralized sympo­
sium,” said Jessie Ramey, found­
ing director of the URO. “A lot of 
places will have an engineering 
symposium or a computer science 
or an art symposium. But very 
few places have an undergraduate 
research program that supports 
students across the entire institu­
tion.”
Ramey worked together with 
Barbara Lazarus, former associate 
provost of Academic Affairs, to 
create the URO in 1989 and later 
designed the first Meeting of the 
Minds in 1996.
“We were very committed to 
make something that was open to 
everybody, and we really wanted 
to very much include the arts and 
humanities as well as the sciences 
and engineers,” Ramey said. “We 
are a research institution, and 
what better way to get students 
involved in the very heart of this 
place than to draw them into the 
actual research process as under­
graduates.”
Ramey encouraged all to attend 
the event.
“It’s really exciting. This is 
like the academic equivalent of 
Carnival. It’s really the best of 
what Carnegie Mellon is about,” 
she said.

The Tartans left Francis Field 
in St. Louis Saturday afternoon 
with more than just a conference 
title in hand. By surviving a 10-7 
overtime war of attrition against 
Washington University (Mo.), 
the newly crowned University 
Athletic Association (UAA) vic­
tors revealed the type of resolve 
and grit that defines champion­
ship teams.
Carnegie Mellon — which a 
week ago defeated last year’s 
UAA title holders, the University 
of Chicago, 27-0 — had cruised 
to a 7-0 mark, averaging a 22- 
point margin of victory. With this 
season’s conference supremacy 
at stake for both schools, how­
ever, Wash. U. tested the Tartans 
unlike any other opponent all 
season.
“I think it says a lot about our 
character,” head coach Rich 
Lackner said. “What I always say 
and what a lot of coaches say — 
it’s kind of a cliche, but —. good 
teams find a way to win.”
The Tartans (8-0, 3-0) and
Bears (5-4, 2-1) each forced 
punts on their opponents’ open­
ing possession. Carnegie Mel­
lon drew first blood early in the 
second quarter when quarter­
back Doug Facemyer capped a 
10-play, 44-yard drive with his 
first touchdown run of the sea­
son. The sophomore, starting his 
second straight game for an in­
jured Kevin Mulkern, found the 
end zone by sprinting right and 
diving for the near pylon. Senior 
kicker Nat Greenstein booted the 
extra point and Carnegie Mellon 
owned a 7-0 lead.
Wash. U., also undefeated in 
conference play and in line for 
the UAA title with a victory Sat­
urday, answered the score two 
drives later off the arm of their 
senior quarterback. Pat McCa­
rthy, who completed all three of 
his passes during a four-play, 40- 
yard march, found senior wide 
receiver Nick Lizanich on a play- 
action pass that covered 27 yards 
for the Bears’ first points.
Although Carnegie Mellon 
and Wash. U. combined for two 
touchdowns in the first six min­
utes of the second quarter, de­
fense dominated the remainder 
of the contest. On the next pos­
session, the Tartans forced their 
third three-and-out of the half to 
return the ball to the offense.
The defense excelled all day, 
but, late in the first half, it was 
Lackner’s special teams unit that 
proved instrumental in safe­
guarding the 7-7 tie.
When Facemyer misfired on 
a third-and-nine from his own 
16 with less than two minutes 
on the clock, the punt team took 
the field. Senior Matthew Adams 
tried to pin Wash. U. deep enough 
to prevent any chance of a late 
second-quarter score. A five-yard 
running-into-the-kicker penalty, 
however, allowed the Tartans to 
replay the down. Lackner gam­
bled and rather than re-kick, the 
Tartans snapped the ball directly 
to the up-back, linebacker James 
Rogers, and the senior charged 
18 yards through the Bear de­
fense. The first down allowed 
the offense to run out the clock 
and escape the first half tied at 
seven.
Offensive woes continued into 
the second half for both teams as 
the Tartans only earned one first 
down on their first three posses­
sions against a tough Wash. U. 
defense. The Bears also strug- 
A
gled to move the chains against 
an equally stout unit. Their first 
three drives of the second half 
followed a familiar recipe: three 
plays, then punt.
“It was a defensive struggle on 
both sides,” Lackner said about a 
unit that allowed just 136 total 
yards. “We had a tough time mov­
ing the ball against a great group 
and our kids played their tail end 
off too, so it was very much so a 
defensive struggle.”
Carnegie Mellon’s most prom­
ising scoring opportunity of the 
second half came after a short 
punt provided great field posi­
tion at the Wash. U. 31. The of­
fense could not take advantage, 
however, and the Bears blocked 
Greenstein’s 44-yard field goal 
attempt on the final play of the 
third quarter.
The offenses again traded 
punts during the opening 10 
minutes of the fourth quarter 
until Wash. U. managed one last 
scoring threat. On second down, 
with barely a minute left in regu­
lation, McCarthy dropped back 
to pass but Rogers tipped the ball 
at the line of scrimmage and se­
nior linebacker Jamie Ploetzner 
hauled it in at the Bears 39.
“That was all Rogers. He came 
on the blitz and ended up getting 
a hand on the ball. I give him all 
the credit for that,” Ploetzner 
said. “I was just concentrating on 
getting the turnover and letting 
our offense have another shot to 
put it in the end zone.”
Despite the great field position 
supplied by Ploetzner’s pick, Car­
negie Mellon could not move into 
field goal range and overtime 
was needed to determine the
2006 UAA champion.
The Tartans, who won the 
ensuing coin toss, elected to pit 
their defense against the ane­
mic Bears offense at the start of 
overtime. An early first down did 
not rattle the defense and two of­
fensive penalties, as well as a six- 
yard loss, kept Wash. U.’s offense 
out of the end zone. On fourth- 
and-12 from the 15, junior Mike 
Elliot lined up for a 32-yard field 
goal but it sailed wide right.
Needing only a field goal to 
clinch the title, the Tartans 
turned to a phase of their game 
plan that had been at the founda­
tion of their 7-0 start: the sixth- 
ranked running game in Division 
III.
Saturday’s 126 rushing yards
*
fell far short of their gaudy 282 
yards per game average, yet when 
the offense needed to shorten the 
field for Greenstein’s leg, Sivek 
and the offensive line produced, 
covering 19 yards on six consecu­
tive carries.
“I think that’s a testament to 
the character of the guys I play 
with on offense,” senior right 
guard J.P. White said. “There 
wasn’t anyone in that huddle that 
was going to step down and set­
tle for anything less than three 
points.”
Sivek’s hard running brought 
the Tartans closer and closer to 
both the Bears’ end zone and the 
program’s seventh UAA title. Fi­
nally, on fourth-and-one from the 
three, Greenstein was called on 
to bring home the Tartan victory. 
The senior’s 22-yard field goal 
cleared the uprights and closed 
out another chapter in the team’s 
storied 2006 season. “It has been 
our goal every year to win the 
UAA,” said Greenstein, who also 
nailed the game-winner in last 
season’s victory over Case West­
ern Reserve University. “When 
you think about it coming down 
to a field goal and being able to 
kick it, it’s a special feeling.”

Everything you need to know
About hot TAs and instant dumping
Hi Myrtle, Dear Myrtle,
I don’t love my girlfriend 
anymore. Things were really 
good when we started out, 
but since then she’s become 
progressively needier, not to 
mention pickier about everything 
from the T-shirts I wear to the 
way I floss. There’s just no hope. 
Trouble is, I’m scared shitless to 
tell her. I know she’s going to cry, 
beg me to stay, and generally 
make me feel terrible. So what 
I want to know is: Can I break 
up with her on Facebook? She 
checks the thing religiously and 
I know she’d find out right away. 
Will that work?
—Scared Of Being A Douche
Hello there SO BAD,
No. You cannot break up with 
your girlfriend on Facebook. That 
goes beyond insensitivity — it is 
the ultimate cowardly thing to do. 
And no, you can't break up with 
her through IM, either, or over the 
phone. Go see her in person and 
.tell her to her face — and give 
her reasons, too. Not reasons 
describing how utterly terrible she is, 
but reasons describing how you feel 
when you're with her and why you 
don't like feeling like that. It’s hard, 
sure, but you’ve got to do it out of 
respect for her and the good times 
you had together. There’s no nice 
way to dump somebody, but there 
are incredibly bad ways. Also, I don't 
know if you’ve tried talking to your 
girlfriend about the problems you've 
been having, SO BAD, but it would 
be worth a try before you gave up 
your relationship as lost. And here’s 
another tip: The next time you meet 
a girl you like, don’t ask her out on 
Facebook or through IM, either.
Cheers,
Myrtle
Help! My English TA is 
ridiculously hot. I drool every 
time I walk into class, I draw 
his silhouette in the margins 
of my notebook, and I frolic in 
endless meadows with him in 
my dreams. He can’t be more 
than a couple of years older than 
me, and I happen to know he’s 
single. I’ve talked to him after 
class a couple of times — only 
about English, mind you — and 
he seems to like me too. Can I 
ask him out? I want to ask him 
so bad that I’m afraid I’ll blurt it 
out during class instead of the 
answer to a grammar question. 
What should I do?
—Pining Over Teacher’s Total 
Yumminess
Hello POTTY:
I have one word for you: wait. At 
semester's end, when the studly 
grammarian is no longer your TA, 
there will be nothing whatsoever 
wrong with the two of you dating. 
But if you ask him now, you could 
get him in big trouble. If he’s worth 
having, then he’s worth waiting for — 
and if he's not, then you’d better ask 
yourself if it’s the naughty teacher- 
student fling you’re craving and not 
the teacher himself. Be patient.
Good luck,
Myrtle

raipap®rhouse“On trackinga radio station.
Music fans, especially those who listen to electronic music, are 
probably aware of a technique called sequencing, where the artist 
arranges notes played by a synthesizer in time. The artist often uses 
an interface called a “piano roll,” which mimics the traditional musical 
staff. Most electronic music is sequenced in this way, though some 
experimental musicians develop their own techniques, while others 
deviate entirely.
Tracking is a variant of sequencing, though it differs from the original 
in two principal ways. Unlike sequencers, trackers are used only to 
arrange and trigger the playback of samples. Second, trackers do not 
attempt to mimic the musical staff. Trackers arrange time along the 
vertical axis as opposed to the horizontal; they don’t separate sound 
sources by instrument or have a direct concept of note length. Instead, 
trackers trigger sample sound files and allow them to play for their 
lengths, and then another sample is triggered in the same channel. 
(Channels are represented as columns in the software, analogous to 
one “instrument” in the piece, though channels can also be samples.)
So why should you care? The tracking paradigm’s advantages are 
exactly the disadvantages of traditional sequencers — trackers are 
very quick and easy to use, requiring no knowledge of traditional music 
theory. Such ease has kept trackers out of most academic settings, 
but they’ve gained a following in the demoscene - a loose collection 
of groups making computer-based music videos rendered in real time. 
When working with tracked music files, it is also (comparatively) easy 
for musicians to write interpreters — programs that pass audio to be 
rendered as sound. And, as you don’t need'a sequencer, you don’t 
have to write a synthesizer to use along with it.
But aside from demogroups, trackers are ideal for many college 
students. Are you a CS student looking to learn more about sequencing 
and sound processing? Write an interpreter for some well-known 
tracker format; it’s an excellent project. Are you an aspiring electronic 
musician? Start learning on a tracker. Lots of musicians who don’t 
even use trackers for final products first lay out sketches of their ideas 
with a tracker, because they’re so easy to use and quick to operate.
And it’s not impossible to become a well-known musician via tracking; 
all Venetian Snares music is tracked, for example, and there are plenty 
of others. From the old standby ScreamTracker III to the Impulse 
Tracker and FastTracker 2 (the two most popular trackers when 
tracking was at its peak in the late ’90s) to new hybrid software like 
Jeskola Buzz and Renoise, tracking is worth checking out.

Lalo Alcaraz
Lalo Alcaraz, creator of the satirical comic strip La 
Cucaracha, visited Carnegie Mellon last Thursday 
as part of Hispanic Heritage Month. He discussed 
his comic and the issues behind it, including 
immigration and Latino stereotypes.
Alcaraz began his comics career in college, drawing 
editorial cartoons for San Diego State University’s 
newspaper, The Daily Aztec, as well as Hispanic 
Link, a newspaper based in Washington, D.C. 
During college, Alcaraz reached a wide audience 
early on, but it took him 20 years to become 
nationally syndicated. He signed up with Universal 
Press, the same company that syndicated Aaron 
McGruder’s The Boondocks, where he drew 
editorial cartoons. Alcaraz has since developed 
La Cucaracha, a comic strip, and is five years 
into a 10-year contract. He hopes to break into 
prime-time animation with a show based on the 
characters in the strip.
Alcaraz did not always know he wanted to be a 
cartoonist (he has an MFA in architecture), but he 
did know that he wanted to be a satirist. “I always 
wanted to do whatever [MAD magazine] did,” he 
said.
Alcaraz is one of only a handful of minority — 
and especially Latino — artists with comic strips 
published in newspapers. Alacaraz said the 
newspaper business is very “old school,” making it 
hard for minorities to break into the comics world.
Alcaraz is often controversial with his comics, 
sparking debate and angry letters to the editors of 
papers that publish him. For example, the Houston 
Chronicle removed La Cucaracha because it 
wasn’t very family-friendly. There have also been 
occasions in which Alacaraz’s strip was removed 
for non-controversial reasons. In March 2007, it 
was briefly removed from the Los Angeles Times 
in order to make room for new features. Alcaraz’s 
fans sent in letters of protest, and the newspaper 
reinstated La Cucaracha before even two days 
had passed.
Alcaraz has published two collections of his comics, 
La Cucaracha and Migra Mouse. La Cucaracha is 
a compilation of his daily comic strips, and Migra 
Mouse is a collection of editorial cartoons relating 
to things like immigration. In addition to drawing, 
Alcaraz also co-edits a satirical magazine, Pocho, 
and has a radio show in Los Angeles.

pillbOX 10.15.07

---------------------------------------------------

Did you know?
Members of the junior class take part in 
one of Carnegie Tech’s famous traditions
— the hazing of the Plebes (first-years). 
The offenders picked up passing 
Oct. 16, 1907 Plebes and paraded them around the 
tennis court. “When business would 
become a bit dull through the absence 
of the lower classmen,” reads a Tartan 
article, “anybody who passed was in 
danger. Several of the instructors were 
threatened."
A cartoon called "Stocking up for 
Homecoming" shows a stack of boxes 
full of drinks. The boxes have labels 
featuring wholesome beverages like 
Oct. 15, 1957 “cherry pop" and “dad’s old-fashioned 
root beer,” though the label on the 
bottom of the stack is considerably more 
risqué: “Beverages we are not allowed 
to mention in college publications."
A visiting hypnotist works his magic 
on nine Carnegie Mellon students. The 
hypnotist is known for helping patients 
lose weight, quit smoking, or improve 
Oct. 12, 1982 ^ejr concentration, but his efforts on 
the students are far less practical: He 
hypnotizes his subjects into thinking 
they are Pac-Man, a Martian, etc. Even 
if it were a hoax, it must have been 
entertaining.
^ ^ After 15 months of petitioning and
two defeated proposals, the Graduate 
Student Association (GSA) finally splits 
from the Student Senate. Graduate 
Oct. 20, 1997 students, who felt underrepresented as 
members of the Student Senate, are 
happy to have their own organization, 
though some undergraduate students 
are not so satisfied; one senior music 
major worries that the GSA will only 
use their newfound independence to 
take money away from other, more 
deserving groups.
Coliege students are taking Ritalin and 
Adderall to pull all-nighters and get 
better grades, so says a front-page 
article. So, next time your roommate 
Oct. 14, 2002 comes home with a 4.0, check for 
shaky hands.
^ Javier Grillo-Marxtiach, a writer for the 
TV show Lost, lectures as part of the 
Alumni Writing Series. Grillo-Marxuach, 
an H&SS graduate, described his career 
Oct. 16, 2006 path, favorite Carnegie Mellon teachers, 
and writing techniques, conveniently 
avoiding some more pressing questions: 
Why are there polar bears on the island? 
Who are "the Others”? What is the 
monster?

Artists and art-lovers came out to Schenley Plaza Sunday afternoon for 
the affectionately named Sundae Flea Market, featuring food, music, 
and — of course — items for sale. Local entrepreneurs sold both 
crafts and clothing unique enough to put your Urban Outfitters friends
