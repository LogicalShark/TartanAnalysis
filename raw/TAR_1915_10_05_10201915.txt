DESIGN MASQUE AND 
BALL COMING
Plans Now Crystalized. To Be Elab­
orate Affair.
The formal corridors of the Design 
School will soon change in appear­
ance to the throne-room and banquet 
hall of Charlemagne, emperor of the 
west, and king of the Franks. At a 
masque and ball to be given by the 
Design students upon the night of 
November tenth the emperor’s castle 
will be thronged with Saracens, 
Monks, Crusaders, Goths, Courtiers, 
cowlid monks, jesters, beggars and 
the peasantry of Charlemagne’s early 
domain.
The main foyer of the Design hall 
will be chosen for the emperor’s 
throne-room where an imposing royal 
seat will be erected. This throne 
with seats for the King and Queen 
and their court favorites will face the 
Dean’s office, the doorway of which 
will be modeled into a cavernous fire­
place with mellow flickering flames 
that will silhouette the dancers as 
they pass before the throne room. 
The long corridors to the right and 
left of the fireplace will be decorated 
after the Romanesque architecture. 
Rich oriental rugs, tapestries, and 
lounging cushions will be placed 
along each side of the hall while the 
walls and ceiling will be decorated 
with potted foliage, plaques and or­
nate streamers. Moonlight effects 
and lighted candles will help to lend 
a mystic and powerful charm to the

ALLEGHENY STUDENT 
INJURED SATURDAY.
Falls From Grandstand.
ALLEGHENY DECISIVELY BEATEN, 4L?
SURPRISE TO THE METHODISTS BRILLIANT (¡AME
In a game replete with thrills and 
brilliant exhibitions of sterling foot­
ball, the large crowd of assembled en­
thusiasts witnessed Allegheny College 
receive an unexpected reversal out of 
proportion to previous athletic prow­
ess. Under the excellent instruction 
of Dr. Charles Hammett, who is well 
liked here for his many sportsmanlike 
qualities, and Kenneth McCutcheon, 
of Cornell fame, the visitors presented 
a formidable corps of gladiators, a 
qualified standard by which we may 
now authoritatively judge the excel­
lencies and deficiencies of our spirited 
representatives on the old “gridiron.” 
Findlay and Altdoerffer Star.
We cannot forget the clever field- 
running of Findlay who was our big­
gest asset on offense, and Aultdoerf- 
fer’s brilliant defense—how practical­
ly unaided he held the visitors for 
downs after four completed forward 
passes. Marshal and Kesner were 
likewise dependable in all depart­
ments. Kutz surpassed all his com­
rades in the line for warring defense 
and more than fulfills expectations 
that have been aroused in his behalf. 
Lauer and Levy at the wings were un­
conquerable and added to this 
“Whitey” Hellstrom at center and an 
almost invincible defense is assured 
for the remaining engagements. But 
there still clings in our memory a
vision of an explosion on the left of 
our line that left a hole through which 
the whole visiting squad could have 
ridden in a taxicab, on one or two 
occasions. And also we still see a 
long series of completed forward 
passes on the side of our opponents 
that may have resulted disastrously 
but for the accurate catapaulting of 
Altdoerffer and Kesner that brought 
down the successful recipients of the 
above mentioned passes.
Visitors Receive Applause.
Captain Pierson at right end, Cox 
at quarter, Bash, Arnold and Askey, 
who succeeded Munhall, the big full of 
the visitors—incapacitated by an at­
tack of grippe,—received round after 
round of generous applause from the 
appreciative spectators for their spir­
ited and effective play. Cox is re­
sponsible for the many successful for­
ward passes of the visitors and Pier­
son was the strong defensive factor. 
Since 1912 Allegheny has been unde­
feated and since 1909 by Tech, during 
which time we have received several 
severe trouncings at their hands. Sat­
urday’s result vindicates our prophe­
cies that Tech has the best team that 
ever collected from our campus. The 
game was more closely contested than 
the score would seem to indicate, and

INDUSTRIAL TEACHERS’ BAN- A. S. M. E. MEETS WITH LARGE 
Q'UET AND SMOKER. CROWD.
Dr. Miner and Dean Connelley Talk.Talk By A. V. McNamara, Followed 
By Discussion.
W. G. Catherman, a student in the 
Junior clalss at Allegheny College, 
fell from the grandstand at the game 
Saturday and sustained a broken leg. 
At first it was feared that more serious 
complications had resulted, but exam­
ination at the West Penn Hospital, 
where the patient is now resting, 
showed that he had luckily escaped 
anything worse. The fall was about 
twenty-five feet, as with several others 
he had been sitting on the top railing 
in order to get a better view of the 
game, when the slender piece of lum­
ber gave way, precipitating him on 
the rocks below. Catherman will prob­
ably be confined in the hospital for 
some time and will be visited during 
his confinement by delegations from 
several of the fraternities.
The Industrial Teachers’ Class held 
a banquet and smoker last Friday 
evening at the German Club in honor 
of the new men who have entered that 
course this year.
Before the dinner was served the 
fellows all participated in singing the 
school songs, and there were vocal 
solos by W. B. Jones and piano solos 
by A. H. Schütz. After dinner the 
class president, H. T. Morris, acted 
as toastmaster and introduced the 
chief speaker of the evening, Dr. 
Miner, of the Department of Psychol­
ogy. Dr. Miner, in his address, told 
about the work of the Continuation 
Schools and school museums of Ger­
many and illustrated some of the 
practical methods of teaching.
Following Dr. Miner’s address the

10 HOLD BENEFIT
Proceeds of Movies and Dance For 
Scholarship Fund.
The members of the Alumni Asso­
ciation of the Margaret Morrison 
Carnegie School are planning a 
“Movie Benefit” for the Alumnae 
Scholarship Fund. It is to be held 
in the boys’ gymnasium on Friday 
night, October 22nd. There will be 
two performances; the first is sched­
uled from 7:30 until 9 o’clock, and the 
second is from 9:15 until 10:30. After 
the second performance there will be 
dancing and eats. Two sets of tick­
ets are on sale; the ten cent ones en­
title the holders to view the picture 
at the first performance, while the 
twenty-five cent ones include all priv­
ileges,—movies, dancing, and eats.
All students and alumni of the four 
schools are invited to come, in fact, 
urged to see these wonderful pictures. 
If you are in doubt as to what a 
“Movie Benefit” is, come on the 22nd 
to the boys’ gymnasium. Get your 
tickets early before they are all sold. 
The gym will seat only a limited num­
ber of people and no seats beyond the 
capacity of the gym will be sold.
Tickets may be obtained from the 
Bursar or the general office at M. M.

COLLEGE HAS GOOD 
TEAM.
The C. I. T. student section of the 
A. S. M. E. held its regular monthly 
meeting in the club room of the Sci­
ence Building on Wednesday, Oc­
tober 13.
Mr. A. V. McNamara, president of 
the Machinists Union, addressed an 
audience of forty-nine students and 
alumnae on the “Relation that Should 
Exist Between the Engineer and the 
Workmen in the Shop.” He explained 
fully his position of leader of the 
movement that is making such a stren­
uous campaign to procure better 
wages, hours, and working conditions 
for the workmen. He declared him­
self to be strongly in favor of woman 
suffrage and expressed his opinion

Some people, ignorant of the con­
ditions at Grove City College this fall, 
and judging simply by their foot ball 
team of last fall, might expect an easy 
victory for Tech next Saturday. But 
we would advise all such to be rather 
careful at what odds they back their 
opinions, for Carnegie will be in for 
a hard struggle.
Under their new coaches, Aker 
and Harmon, Grove City has 
put in the field a light but strong and 
experienced team who last Saturday 
took over Bethany College 27-0 in 
their second game of the season. This 
is sufficient in itself to cause the coach 
and players to sit up and take no­
tice, so that no let up need be ex­
pected in the workouts this week.
LTp to last year the Grove City 
had the lead in total points scored, 
Tech having only 16 to their 34. These 
were the years when “Dummy” Marks 
was fullback and earned in the grand-

VICTORY!
Our hats off to the plucky Plaid 
eleven and its coach. The showing 
made last Saturday against Allegheny 
College was extremely gratifying. Al­
though we were assured victory at the 
beginning, we must say the remark­
able playing of the Carnegie team was 
a surprise. Straight foot ball was 
used and not a new play was un­
corked. The Allegheny College team 
have defeated us every year since 
1909, when the Plaid team handed 
them their initial defeat. The Alle­
gheny team has not been beaten by 
any team since the 1912 season. Looks 
well for Carnegie!
On boys and make this a one hun­
dred per cent year. You can do it

ture oponents did last Saturday:

PITT UPHOLDS TECH.
In looking over the editorial col­
umns of the last issue of the “Pitt 
Weekly,” we observe an editorial 
entitled ‘Our Hat Off To Tech.” The
editorial has a double significance to 
us inasmuch as it not only upholds 
our stand in the West Virginia con­
troversy but also shows that there 
are other schools who equally realize 
the importance of maintaining a high 
standard in athletic relations, and 
who would take similar drastic mea­
sures to uphold this standard. The 
“Pitt Weekly” says in part, ‘The ac­
tion of the athletic authorities of our 
sister institution, the Carnegie Insti­
tute of Technology, in cancelling the 
foot ball game scheduled with the 
team representing West Virginia Un­
iversity, elicits our warmest congrat­
ulations.
It was a brave thing to do and 
it was the only right and proper thing 
to do. This game would have been 
perhaps the most important game of 
the year on Tech’s home schedule. At 
least with the field comparatively 
clear on account of our own teams 
playing abroad Saturday, it would 
have been the. most financially lucra­
tive of Carnegie’s games. Yet not­
withstanding these facts, and the defi­
nite information that fullback Rodg­
ers, the man whose eligibility was in 
question, was unable to play on ac­
count of injuries, Tech cancelled the 
game. With these points in mind it 
is plainly evident that Tech acted 
from purely altruistic motives, for the 
principle of the thing and not because 
Rodgers is a great player. Tech was 
fighting not merely her own battle 
for decency in athletics, but was the 
champion and protaganist of every in­
stitution the country over, which is 
trying to adopt and live up to a real 
standard of eligibility for its inter­
collegiate athletics.”
Aside from the point that this ed­
itorial voices an expression in de­
fence of high athletic standards, we 
also appreciate the friendly feeling 
evidenced in the columns of the Pitt 
weekly.
The student of Tech who has the 
real Tech spirit harbors the same 
friendly sentiment toward our neigh­
bor institution. There has been 
much discussion in the past concern­
ing the relationship between Tech 
and Pitt, and the Tartan wishes to 
take this opportunity to say a few 
words in reference to this matter. The 
true Tech student wishes to regard 
Pitt as a keen and worthy rival, not 
as an enemy. The idea that any spirit 
other than a friendly one exists, is a 
misconception, and not worthy of any 
serious consideration. True sports­
manship is nowhere Riven a more se­
vere test than in keen rivalry, and 
every Tech man surely wishes to up­
hold all the principles of the true 
sportsman.
BULLETIN BOARDS.
A great eyesore to all are the stu­
dent bulletin boards in the various 
buildings. It would almost seem as 
if they were a necessary evil. In 
every school, when one wants a no­
tice posted, the notice finds a place 
on the board regardless of whether 
it is over one equally important or 
not. Every one that posts a notice 
should see that it is removed immedi­
ately after its purpose is accomp­
lished. In this way the boards would 
not be so congested. By the exercise 
of a little care, the bulletin boards 
could be brought to the place where 
they are no longer an eyesore to the 
passerby.
MASS MEETINGS.
There has been a failure in the 
greatest sense in our student mass 
meetings. There seems to be a lack 
of cooperation between the school on 
this score. Last Wednesday a mass 
meeting was announced at 4.15. We 
are inclined to feel that the failure 
of this last meeting was, at least in 
part, greatly due to the fact that the 
mass meeting was not properly adver­
tised. In fact we do not hesitate to 
say that less than 50 per cent of the 
student body were aware of the fact 
that such a mass meeting was to take 
place. The idea of a mass meeting 
on the field is a very good one and we 
would suggest that the men behind 
this idea makes a particular effort to 
act in uniformity with all the schools.
The M. M. C. S. girls could at least 
help with a few of their songs. It 
would add a distinctive college atmos­
phere to our games. You can do it 
girls! Should you let the boys do it 
all? You can join our mass meetings 
or have your own, but above all do 
something to change the same old 
“tune.” Carnegie stands for some­
thing new and distinctive, as is our 
school.
REGARDS TO THE LEADER.
In an edition of the Pittsburgh 
Leader last week we were treated to 
the most exciting bit of real fiction 
that has come to our notice for some 
time. The most startling informa­
tion was imparted concerning the in­
ternal relations of our athletics. Myth­
ical students where reported as hav­
ing made stirring speeches at the 
“General Assembly.” Stirring scenes 
of action were portrayed and in fact 
the most wonderful fact was brought 
to light that we, the student body of 
Tech, were opposed to seeing our 
team play. Of course we do not seri­
ously wish to reply to this “article,” 
we do not feel that it is serious, we 
only wish that we could make our 
little comment as humorous. A real 
feeling of pride however must have 
overcome the reporter of the Leader 
when he read his article, and we must 
admit that he was justified, only we 
might suggest that such wonderful 
literature would be far more lucrative 
if bon d between the highly colored 
pages of some form of a novel.
THE NEW BLEACHERS.
There has been some misunder­
standing of the student body in gen­
eral over the new bleachers on the 
north side of Tech Field. These 
bleachers are not for the plebes alone 
but for all Tech students. There has 
been a sentiment expressed by some 
outsiders that there have been no 
seats at the games, as the students 
took up the room. The bleachers
were erected on the opposite side to 
accommodate the students and to get 
better effect in cheering. There were 
quite a number of unoccupied seats 
in that section and quite a number of 
students in the old stands last Satur­
day. Will the student body see that 
as many as possible get to the north 
side bleachers? where you are on the 
side lines and get a much better view 
of the game.
We can get record crowds at the 
games if we only treat our patrons in 
a better light, give them the good 
old college “spirit” which they expect 
when they go to a game. Remember 
the north side bleachers next Satur­
day.
COMMUNICATIONS.
The Tartan at all times solicits com­
munications from any of the students 
alumni or faculty of Tech. We do not 
however bear any responsibility for 
any sentiment or policy voiced in such 
communications, nor will we consider 
any such communications unless 
signed by the author.
THE SCIENCE SENIOR ELEC­
TION.
Editor, The Tartan.
Dear Sir: In conjunction with the
results of the Senior class election, T 
request that you extend me the cour­
tesy of publishing this article. While 
it is intended to relate to the man­
ner of procedure in the present Sen­
ior election, my purpose is not pri­
marily to direct my remarks to the 
present Seniors. I would most par­
ticularly appeal to Science Juniors— 
to all men who expect to be members 
of the next Senior class.
Just as the question has popped up 
before Senior classes in the past, just 
as it came before us in the present 
election, so will it undoubtedly force 
itself upon you again next year. That 
troublesome question is this: “How
shall we decide who we want for our 
class president,,” A smile probably 
lights up your face as you read this, 
and you formulate your answer to 
what you regard as an exceptionally 
simple problem—one which is, in fact, 
a “pipe” for all our students with the 
surprising exception of our Seniors.
You Plebes, Sophomores, and Jun­
iors have always held your election, 
cast your ballots, and declared the 
man having the highest number of 
votes to be the winner. And just as 
you have elected your representatives 
in the classroom, in just the same 
manner will you do it when you elect 
public officials when you leave school.
But from past experience, I am 
compelled to draw the unwelcome 
conclusion that a Senior at Carnegie 
must pass through a sort of transi­
tory election experience in the short 
interim between his casting the bal­
lot as a student and doing the same 
as an intelligent citizen. Like most 
inventors, some Seniors are always 
going to “revolutionize” something, 
and our poor innocent election sys­
tem has not escaped their clutches. 
Until the present year, I understand,

ALUMNI NOTES.
John Murphy, Commercial ’14, the 
man who was noted while at school 
for his big smile and who has been 
with the Barret Manufacturing Com­
pany, is now assisting Mr. Beeken in 
the Bureau of Employment.
C. Holzworth, who has been assist­
ant blast furnace superintendent with 
the J. & L. Steel Company, will soon 
go to Cleveland to accept a better 
position with the Pricketts Mathers 
Co.
Several communications have been 
received from Fred Foster, ’08, who is 
now with the Pittsburgh Testing Lab­
oratories at Dallas, Texas. He com­
plains of the intense heat but seems 
to be well satisfied with his new posi­
tion. It is understood that there are 
other attractions for Foster in this 
section of the country.
George Douthett, former member of 
the Tennis Team, has been taking a 
vacation at Chesapeake Bay.
We are sorry to hear that on ac­
count of illness Jim Sampson, 08, has 
had to leave his work at St. Louis. 
We were glad to see him at the foot­
ball game, however.
We are glad to see Henry Levy, ’15, 
amongst us again. He is taking a 
post-graduate course in Commercial 
Engineering.
G. C. Smith, Chemical ’15, is now 
with Etna Chemical Company in Pitts­
burgh.
Theo. Wasson, who was a member 
of the ’11 class, is with us againg, re­
suming his studies at school. Every­
body who knew Wasson will be glad 
to see him back after his long stay in 
California doing mine work and sur­
veying.
Of last year’s engineering gradu­
ates, we hear from some in all parts 
of the country.
A. D. Moore, president of last 
year’s Mho Club and graduate in Elec­
trical Engineering is with the West- 
inghouse Electric and Manufacturing 
Company in their 12 month appren­
tice course for technical graduates. 
After this course they either offer a 
man a permanent position with their 
company, or else turn him loose with 
the best of practical experience. 
Benny Hantman, captain of last year’s 
scrubs is also with the Westinghouse, 
but at one of their arms plants at 
Springfield, Mass. Ed Harry, an­
other electrical is an engineer for the 
National Tube Co. of McKeesport.
Of the mechanicals, Fred Ziesen- 
heim and “Hap” Pringle, Comm., is 
with the American Blower Co., of De­
troit, and P. E. Finger is working for 
the Murphy Foundry and Machine 
Co., of New Kensington, Pa. Mark 
Stockdale is with the Mesta Machine 
Co., “Hank” is an advertising man.
G. C. Smith is with a local firm, the 
Etna Chemical Co., and apparently 
the position is a good one for he de­
clined an offer to teach Chemistry at 
State College to stay with this com­
pany. Tom Patterson is holding 
down a government job at Washing­
ton, D. C., engaged in the making of 
explosives, while Bill Welch, an old 
foot ball man, is with the Macbeth-
Evans Glass Co., of Pittsburgh. L. S. 
Kelso is a Macbeth-Evans employe.
S. A. Adolfsen is working in Akron, 
while Jack Cameron, the originator 
of “Dear Old Tech,” is at present in 
Duluth, Minn. “Abe” Martin and 
“Red” Carroll are employed with Bell 
Telephone Co., and “Roly” Wilson is 
with “Jones and Laughlin Co., of 
Aliquippa, Pa.
We still have J. R. Dolan and W. N. 
Flanagan with us at Tech, but this 
year they are instructors, not in­
structed.
ALUMNI LUNCH.
At the Fort Pitt Hotel on last Wed­
nesday noon, October 13, 1915, the 
regular semi-monthly luncheon of the 
local chapter of the C. I. T. alumni 
was held. A luncheon like this is held 
on the second and fourth Wednes­
days of every month.
At present Mr. C. E. Gilson, of the 
Class of 1914 is acting as chairman of 
the chapter, but soon regular officers 
will be chosen.
The officers of this Alumni Asso­
ciation Schools of Applied Science 
and Applied Design who held office 
last year, are: H. J. McCorkle, presi­
dent; J. W. Dougherty, ’11, 1st vice 
president; W. H. Rieger, ’08, secre- 
tary-treasurer ; A. Colmery, ’08, 2nd 
vice president.
As soon as the organization for this 
year is completed, full particulars will 
appear in these columns.
ATHLETIC NOTES.
Allegheny didn’t kick off in either 
half, Saturday.
Tech only punted twice, Kesner and 
Altdoerffer once each, in the first half. 
Only once, however, were we held for 
downs.
Probably all the crowd noticed how 
hard Altdoerffer hit his men. Once 
when he hit Arnold, the latter on get­
ting up, said, “Pretty hard, old man, 
but not quite hard enough.” The next 
time Altdoerffer hit him every one in 
the grandstand groaned at the force 
of the collision and Arnold picked 
himself up slowly and walked off 
limping.
It was the prettiest passing game 
seen on Tech field.
Some people should have plenty of 
money to take them to Case.
The cross country team is hard at 
work. They are about due for a write­
up next week.
See notice about swimming team in 
other column.
SWIMMING TEAM TO BE 
FORMED.
Meet With Pitt and P. A. A.
Coach Dull, of the track team, has 
announced to several of the fellows 
that it will be possible for Carnegie to 
organize a swimming team this winter 
as a pool in which the team can prac­
tice can be secured. It is probable 
that a triangular mtet with Pitt and 
the team of the Pittsburgh Athletic 
Club will take place in the pool of the 
latter. Anyone interested should see 
Mr. McCulloch.
BASKETBALL PRACTICE COM­
MENCES THURSDAY.
Competition for Second Assistant 
Manager.
Basketball practice for the coming 
season will commence tomorrow in 
the gymnasium at 4:30. All new and 
old men should report at that time 
to Captain Hines. Also all candidates 
for the position of second assistant 
manager should report to Manager 
Ammerman. Particulars as to the out­
look and schedule will be published 
later.
CROSS COUNTRY TRIALS.
Final Try Out On November Fifth.
After three weeks’ practice the 
cross country squad is rapidly round­
ing into form and gives promise of 
a team on which we can find highest 
hopes. But the final and acid test 
will come two weeks from Friday 
when the entire squad will be given 
a five mile run through Schenley 
Park. These annual trials are by no 
means slow, in fact last year the time 
made was better than that made in 
some of the meets. The five miles 
was traversed in about thirty-one 
minutes last fall and this year’s trials 
will be as fast if not faster. Knowing 
what they have to buck up against, 
the cross country men are doing their 
best to get into the best of form by 
that time. It is not too late, however, 
for others to come out for the team 
as there still remains over two weeks 
before the final tryouts. But, as it is 
easy, to see, with such a short time, 
any delay in reporting cannot be per­
mitted.
The trials not only decide who shall 
and who shall not run on the cross 
country team, but also they give us 
the first chance to get an idea of the 
strength and speed of the team. Thus 
it turns out to be one of the most im­
portant events of the cross country 
season.
GROVE CITY HARD BATTLE
Continued from Page 1 
stands the soubriquet of “the beef 
trust.” But last year owing to many 
of their best players being out be­
cause of their scholastic standing and 
several injuries, Tech walked away 
with the game, winning 53-0. This 
makes three games won for Carnegie, 
two lost and one tied.
Saturday should see the largest 
crowd of the year as Pitt plays at 
Penn where, by the way, our neigh­
bors should add another star to their 
crown. Cheer up, it will be all the 
more credit to us after November 
13th. But to return, Grove City will 
as usual be represented by a large and 
hard rooting crowd of Alumni and it 
is to be hoped that ALL Tech root­
ers will sit in the stands across the 
field, giving the visitors plenty of 
room in the best seats. Some stu­
dents do not seem to realize that they 
are at the games to root and not pas­
sively look on. So come out, get 
across, and pull hard.

accommodate the large crowd of Tech 
students who will wish to accompany 
the team to Case on November 6th. 
The railroads refused to come across 
with any lower rate than $5.94 for the 
round trip, and things looked both 
expensive and dubious for awhile. 
However, it has been discovered that 
it will be possible to go as far as 
Youngstown by the electric interur- 
ban lines and there take a special train 
for Cleveland. Special electric cars 
will also be provided.
This method of travel will lower the 
cost for the round trip to $3.70 and 
will not cause a very great sacrifice 
of time and none of comfort. It will 
also be possible to have short parades 
through the business sections of New 
Castle and Youngstown on the way 
as the band will accompany the root­
ers, of whom there will be a very large 
crowd. These rates should suit every­
one who does not actually have to 
work that day. Further particulars 
will be announced later.
BUREAU OF MINES BUILDINGS' 
TO BE ERECTED.
Construction Work will Commence 
This Fall.
For the past few months we have 
been observing with interest the var­
ious excavating processes which have 
been going on in preparation for the 
erection of the Pittsburgh Testing 
Station of the United States Bureau 
of Mines. The excavating for this 
group of buildings is now entirely 
completed, a total of seventy-five 
thousand cubic yards of earth having 
been removed. The building opera­
tions are to commence immediately 
upon the completion of the excavating 
estimate which is being done at pres­
ent. The group of buildings will con­
sist of three buildings to be erected 
on the level of Forbes street. These 
three buildings will be the Adminis­
tration Building, the Mechanical 
Building, and the Mechanical Labora­
tory, and will be arranged in the form 
of a U, the Administration building 
being in the middle of the group. On 
the lower level a Power house, Boiler 
house, Metallurgy Laboratory, and 
Fuel Testing Building will be erected. 
The total cost of these buildings will 
be about $500,000 and will be com­
pleted in about eighteen months. The 
contractor for this work is George B. 
Wills, of New York. There will be 
about 200 to 250 men employed in this 
station, all of whom will be experts 
in their particular line of work.

JUNIOR PARTY FOR PLEBES.
The Junior Class entertained the 
Plebes at a tea dansant last Friday 
afternoon in the recreation room. The. 
chief amusement of the afternoon was 
dancing. One dance was especially 
,exciting—each couple was given a 
number as they went onto the floor. 
One by one the numbers were called 
out, each couple dropping out when 
called. The last couple remaining on 
the floor received a handsome prize. 
The lucky girls were Miss Fire and 
her partner and they were presented 
with a most lifelife and intelligent 
looking puppy-dog by Miss Belleville 
and Miss Mason of the Plebe advis­
ors.
Miss Virginia Campbell gave a 
reading—“"Mrs. McDooney on Roller 
Skates”—for the girls, and responded 
to the hearty applause with a most 
touching little encore concerning the 
disadvantages of “Hand-me-Downs.”
Finally the “best eats yet”—accord­
ing to the Plebes—were served and 
then the party ended.
And we Juniors hope we have made 
a good impression on the Plebes.
TUESDAY ASSEMBLY.
At the regular monthly Student As­
sembly held Tuesday, Miss Mary 
Ride, president of the Self-Govern- 
ment Association, presided. A few 
minutes at the beginning was spent 
in singing with Miss Stoner at the 
piano.
Then, Miss Demarest, chairman of 
the Student Activities Committee, 
spoke concerning the support of or­
ganizations by the students. She ex­
tended to all a cordial invitation “to 
come and play.” No matter how hard 
any one is working, they are it, both 
to their school and themselves, to 
take some time for play. She urged 
the girls to come to the rescue of a 
Glee Club which was already dead, a 
Dramatic Club which was half dead, 
and a Guild which was thriving. Miss 
Demarest also mentioned the infant 
organizations as the Athletic Asso­
ciation and the Self-Government As­
sociation, which need careful nursing 
to enable them to grow into strong, 
healthy groups.
Miss Pichel, last year’s president 
of the Dramatic Club, then made a 
plea for more girls to join and take 
an interest in dramatics. A meeting 
was announced for Thursday and all 
were urged to come. Miss Pichel 
also spoke concerning the Athletic 
Association of which she is president, 
and mentioned Tuesday at 3:30 as 
practice day for the basket ball teams, 
at which time, any girls interested 
might come.
Miss Francis Willis made a short 
announcement of the time and place 
of meeting of the Weekly Bible Cir­
cle. Miss Belleville is the leader and 
at present the girls are studying old 
Testament characters. Any girls to 
whom this appeals are asked to come
on Mondays at 4:30 to Room 105.
Miss Sanford, president of the 
Guild, spoke of her organization, and 
made the announcement, that in the 
recent membership campaign over 
200 members were secured. All that 
is asked now is that these girls con­
tinue to keep up their splendid enthu­
siasm long enough to attend the 
Masquerade Dance on Friday night, 
October 29th. The admission will be 
$1.00 and the proceeds will be used for 
charity.
After a shuort M. M. C. S. cheer, 
the assembly broke up.
SOPH CLASS MEETING.
At a class meeting of the Sopho­
more Class it was decided to have a 
party for the Plebes, on Friday, the 
5th of November. This late date was 
chosen in order to give the Plebes 
a rest from the “strenuous life,” for 
all the classes have insisted with gra­
cious hospitality on entertaining 
them, with the idea, which is a most 
worthy one, that they must get ac­
quainted and that right soon.
DORM TEA.
Last Sunday afternoon, Miss Irene 
Spicer, Miss Edice Reider, and Miss 
Desmonda Guenther of the Fifth 
Ave. Dorm, served tea in their rooms 
from three to five o’clock. The affair 
was given specially to meet the new 
girls of the dormitory, the older girls 
acting as aides. The room was at­
tractively decorated with fall leaves, 
while nasturtiums and shaded candles 
were arranged on the tea table where 
Miss Spicer poured. The affair was 
a big success and offered an excel­
lent opportunity for the Dorm girls 
to be one large family.
DORM DANCE.
The girls of the Morewood Avenue 
dormitory entertained—themselves
and some others— at dancing Friday 
night. The whole lower floor was 
decorated with autumn leaves. Miss 
Lyon and Miss Collingwood chaper­
oned. Light refreshments were 
served.
WEDNESDAY ASSEMBLY.
In the absence of the dean at the 
regular Wednesday Assembly, Miss 
Stoner took charge of the meeting. 
Mr. O’Brien came in and talked to 
the girls concerning the organization 
of a choral club. If this idea meets 
with success, the club will hold its 
regular meetings on Tuesday after­
noons at 3:30. All girls who are at 
all interested in the formation of such 
a club are urged to come to the As­
sembly Hall next Tuesday and dis­
cuss plans. There will be no formal 
try-out of voices; any one who sings, 
no matter how little, is urged to be 
present and help the attempt become 
a success.
The rest of the time was spent in 
practicing school songs, especially 
Loch Lomond, which is to be sung 
on Carnegie Day.
DRAMATIC CLUB ELECTION.
At a meeting of the Dramatic Club 
held last Thursday in the Assembly 
Hall, the following girls were elected 
to office:
President—Miss Francis Willis.
Secretary-Treasurer—Miss Ruth 
Pontius.
Mistress of the Wardrobe—Miss 
Florence Burgham.
Stage Manager—Miss Charlotte 
Watson.
Librarian—Miss Margaret Brooks.
The Dramatic Club may be congrat­
ulated on securing Miss Willis as pres­
ident, and one may be sure that she 
will succeed in keeping up the stand­
ard which former presidents have 
striven for and attained. A commit­
tee has already been appointed which 
is working on the revision of the con­
stitution, which needs changing and 
strengthening. The committee con­
sists of Miss Marion Pichel, Miss 
Ruth Pontius, Miss Margueirte Men- 
ges and the president.
RESULTS OF ELECTION.
Miss Margaret Worth was elected 
by the student body to accompany 
Miss Mary Ride to Cleveland, to the 
convention of Intercollegiate Self- 
government Associations. The meet­
ing will be held the beginning of 
November and offers a splendid 
opportunity for acquiring new ideas 
and seeing what other schools are do­
ing in the same line. In Miss Ride 
and Miss Worth, the school has two 
representatives who are worthy and 
well able to represent us as we wish 
to be represented.
Miss Regina Jacobs was elected 
cheer leader of the school, and she 
soon will have us coming to all the 
athletic games cheering our teams to 
victory.
GUILD MASQUERADE DANCE.
The following committees have 
been appointed by the Guild president 
to look after the Hallowe’en dance:
General Arrangements—Chairman, 
Christine Cameron, Irene McNamee, 
Margaret Brooks.
Program—Chairman, Gladys Wake­
field, Martha Woodruff, Elizabeth 
Dearing.
Decoration — Chairman, Ermal 
Pryne, Iney Heacock, Grace Shields, 
Martha Trass, Lucille Wakefield.
Refreshments — Chairman, Char­
lotte Watson, Marjorie Carmichel, 
Dorothy Davis.
CHORAL CLUB FORMATION.
Mr. Weber is exceedingly eager to 
secure a large number of members 
for the Choral Club which is to meet 
every Tuesday at 3:30 o’clock in the 
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Build­
ing. This club is to present eleven 
numbers on Carnegie Day at the Ex­
hibition Hall and all students are eli­
gible. Some vocal training, however, 
must be secured in previous years.

The regular meeting of the Student 
Assembly was held last Wednesday. 
After being introduced by Dean Con- 
nelley, Mr. C. E. Och and Mr. C. H. 
Chance, two prominent business men 
of Oakland and representing the Oak­
land Board of Trade, presented a large 
silver cup, which was won in last 
year’s Hallowe’en parade. Both Mr. 
Och and Mr. Chance gave short talks 
and in closing, asked the co-operation 
of every Tech man, towards helping 
to make the Hallowe’en parade in 
Oakland this year, the best ever.
Following the presentation of the 
cup, the regular business of the As­
sembly was taken up. C. K. Koontz 
was elected Secretary of the Assem­
bly to take the place of O. D. Kings­
bury, who was elected to the office last 
June, but did not return to school this 
year. R. K. Merker, musical director 
of the Industries School, was elected 
to the Student Activities Board and
F. A. Finlay was elected to the Board 
of Control.
Last Wednesday afternoon about 40 
men and women, members of the 
Grangers’ Association of Lawrence 
County, who had come down to Pitts­
burgh on an excursion, visited the In­
dustries School. Under the guidance 
of Koontz and Hoxworth of the Mid­
dle Class, they were shown the vari­
ous shops in action, which greatly in­
terested them. Lack of time did not 
permit them to visit the other schools, 
but all were much impressed with the 
beauty of the buildings.
The Plebe Class held a meeting on 
Thursday afternoon for the election of 
the men to the various committees. 
The following men were elected:
Student Senate, A. O. Doffort.
Student Organization, W. J. Miller.
Club Room Committee, G. R. Cour­
ier, J. Hermann.
Athletics, F. R. Miller.
Tartan Representative, W. C. Craw­
ford.
Cheer Leader, C. J. Geisel.
We are all glad to have with us 
again H. J. Bergwall, ’18, and H. L. 
Cornwall, ’16, who returned to school 
during the past week.
The work on the engine lathes, be­
ing made entirely by the classes in 
Machiné Construction is rapidly pro­
gressing and many excellent pieces 
have been turned out.
Prof.: “Mr. Hallum, what is a four­
cycle engine?”
Hallum: “A four-cycle engine is
one that has four cylinders.”
Note—We give Mr. Hallum credit 
for the fact that a four-cycle engine 
is one that has four cylinders some­
times, but not always; just the same 
as Allegheny is a team that beats 
Tech in football sometimes, but not 
always.
Louisiana Carey was in our midst, 
and a guest at the Assembly meeting 
last Wednesday.
Mesta and Rodgers, Plebes in ihe 
1913-14 classes, are again in school. 
Mesta was out on account of failing 
eyes and Rodgers sojourned at Mer-
cersburg Academy.
The Senior foundrymen, Hedlund, 
Oeffinger, and Peters spent an inter­
esting day at the Union Steel Casting 
Company’s plant in the city recently.
Merker, on the Activities Board, 
should make a capable representative. 
He has a good personality and a level 
head.
Caruso McNulty is at work in the 
Mesta shops at Homestead singing 
the buzz-saw to sleep.
Mr. Alberts, formerly assistant to 
Mr. Dosey, is now a traveling sales­
man for a molding machine concern.
“Mike” Sweeney, who graduated last 
June and is now in Science, has been 
pledged to Beta Theta.
Fellows should keep the Club Room 
in better shape.
The Assembly is in full swing and 
augurs well for a successful term.
Wean and Koontz split up the first 
scholarship. Last year Peters, Head- 
lund and Moore were the rivals.
IN THE TEACHERS’ COURSE.
“Red” Robbins: “But, Mr. Zerbe,
we know nothing about the psychol­
ogy of a woman.”
Mr. Zerbe: “That’s alright, Mr.
Robbins, your chance is coming.”
Robinson, after a debate on an edu­
cational question: “Mr. Peters, why 
must those speakers of the affirmative 
use such big terms as psychological, 
physiological and economical?”
AVO CLUB WILL HOLD 
SMOKER.
Celebrate Edison Day.
The Avo Club, of the School of Ap­
plied Industries, will hold a smoker in 
the Carnegie Union this coming Fri­
day evening. The occasion is to mark 
the celebration of Edison Day. There 
will be smokes, eats, talks, music and 
pictures. All interested are invited.
INDUSTRY TEACHERS’ BANQUET
Continued from Page 1 
toastmaster called for short talks 
from a number of the upper-classmen 
and requested each of the Plebes to 
give his name and tell where his home 
was and his promptings for taking his 
present course. The idea of doing this 
was to have the new fellows become 
better known by the upper-classmen. 
Then Dean Connelley arrived and 
gave a very inspiring address, in 
which he explained what the Teach­
ers’ Course would mean to the fellows.
A short business meeting then took 
place, in which R. K. Merker was 
elected Thistle representative, and J.
F. Cope Tartan representative. The 
affair closed with chorus songs.

DORM. TEAMS PLAY TIE 
GAME, 6-6.
The first game on the new athletic 
field occurred last Saturday morning 
between the East and West dormitor­
ies, when the two teams met in the 
first of a series of three games to de­
cide the championship.
The game throughout was fast and 
interesting, both teams being equally 
matched.
The first half began with West 
kicking off to the East and through­
out the entire half the ball see-sawed 
back and forth with perhaps the East 
men having a shade the better of the 
play.
Toward the close of the third quarter 
East scored the first touchdown; 
Smith of East intercepting a forward 
pass and running about forty-five 
yards,' when he was downed on the 
one-yard line. Then Furber carried 
the ball over in one buck. The kick- 
out was made successfully but the goal 
from touchdown was missed.
West scored their touchdown in the 
fourth quarter just one minute before 
time was called. Holland blocked a 
punt and, with the aid of Bosler, ran 
for a touchdown. The kickout failed 
so no goal could be tried. This was 
the extent of the scoring, except a 
trial at a field goal by Crandall of East.
Coaches Steffen and Marks and the 
entire varsity squad were present and 
showed much interest in the contest. 
The next game is to be played next 
Saturday.
As stars must be mentioned Wilson, 
quarter for the East, who played a 
hard and fast game, Furber at full 
and Ward at end. DeLevan played 
the best game on the West team, 
though Holland, who had before only 
engaged in rugby contests, was also a 
hard player.

Forbes Robertson is here and 
working drama students in “Tartuffe” 
night and day.
“Gloria of the Morning” will be 
produced for the D. A. R. visitors on 
October 27th in theatre.
Music and dramatic students have 
a new choral master, Mr. Weber, and 
he’s a dandy. Boys: Knows what he’s 
talking about!” Girls: ‘Isn’t he good 
looking!”
Design girls at the beanery. ‘Gee, 
I wish we could eat at the foot ball 
men’s table. No it isn’t the men, 
that attract, its the toast!”
Supervisors of student health have 
declared candy contrabrand, but how 
about the cigarettes?
Have you noticed the expression 
on ‘Billie’s” race when he translates 
“French?” e. g. Sentence: “unefem- 
me quit bat son gendre.” Billie’s 
translation: “A woman who bats her 
son-in-law.”
“Andy,” that bit of unkempt Scot­
tish humanity with bagpipes, vigor­
ously inflated his left cheek, to the 
horror of Monsieur Bossange, in De­
sign corridors Wednesday noon, and 
departed from delighted students a 
wiser but a richer man.”
Just what T. D. C. stands for ap­
pear in a later issue.
“Wiggles” has gone in for mud- 
pies! His demonstration in the 
draughting room Friday even at­
tracted considerable attention and 
drew many admiring remarks.
Owen Southwell has been called 
“clever” by one of his classmates. 
Owen admits he is “bally clevah.”
The Design School, especially the 
architectural department, was well 
represented at the Morewood Avenue 
Dorm Dance Friday night.
“Fat” Wood is now prosecuting at­
torney for the Sophomore Class. It 
sure does get Fat’s goat to see some 
other fellow conversing with a lady. 
Plebes, take notice. “A word to the 
wise is like a kick in the eyes.”
Got your girl for the “Gothic” ball 
yet, or haven’t you paid your eighty 
cents? See Alley for the latter and 
he’ll help you arrange the former.
Red Trent is “home” again. We 
thought he was lost, but love cures 
all ills and rectifies all mistakes.
The following clipping was sent 
to the draughting room last week. It 
was taken from the “Ambridge Citi­
zen” the leading news courier of Am­
bridge, Pa., and was printed by them 
on October 8.
“Karl Schmidt, of Boston, one of 
the fifty men sent out by Cramb’s, 
foremost publishers of architecture in 
the U. S., recently spent a few days 
in Ambridge. He states that no new 
publication on architecture has been 
issued in the U. S. for sixty years and 
his firm is now arranging a new work.
Here Mr. Schmidt sketched a man­
tle in the Great House in Economy 
now being occupied by Mr. J. S. 
Duso and his daughter, Miss Vera.
Mr. Schmidt expects to return short­
ly and states that it will require (5) 
five weeks to get the sketches he ex­
pects to make in this territory.”
We must give it to “Schmittee” for 
handling this line so well.

DESIGN JUNIOR CLASS ELEC­
TIONS.
The Junior Class has elected for its 
officers the following men: Presi­
dent, Earle H. Beckman; vice presi­
dent, John R. Kilburn; secretary, 
Lewis H. Boss; treasurer, Paul E. 
Kornmann. Mr. Kilburn was elected 
to the Senate.
DESIGN MASQUE AND BALL
Continued from Page 1 
occasion.
Costumes may be chosen at will 
and should, in all exactness, conform 
to the dress of the intervening years 
from 200 to 1250. Remember that 
your costume will lend just as much 
enchantment to the revel as the em­
perors, and if you desire to make this 
occasion one permeated with the true 
Charlemagne customs you must 
choose your attire with care and hold, 
for a time, at least, to the life of that 
early empire.
The masque which is to follow is 
being prepared by Theodore H. Veih- 
man of the Design School, and is to 
hold very precisely to the history of 
the return of the paladins of Charel- 
magne from their crusades through 
Spain and across the Mediterranean 
sea. In his gorgeous throne room the 
emperor will receive his warriers and 
favorites who present him with their 
captures and trophies gathered upon 
their crusades while across the seas. 
Later a delegation from the doge of 
Venice will hold interview with the 
emperor and Charlemagne will then 
order the banquet hall to be cleared 
and for his guests and liegemen to 
eat, drink and make merry in the 
dance to follow.
The “wassail board” will be spread 
in the “march” and despite the fact 
that the menu of Charlemagne’s table 
usually consisted of wine and under­
done beef, it is whispered that salads 
and sherbets will find their way to 
the banquet hall.
Music appropriate to the early em­
pire will be used and will hold as 
closely to the stringed and reed in­
struments as possible. However, as 
the morning hours draw near the 
wild and fantastic dances of Charle­
magne’s court will give way to the 
Toe Trot and the Eagle Rock.
Here is a most excellent opportu­
nity for a tincture of Design Art to 
assert itself. You cannot produce art 
and leave man out; all art must sug­
gest something. Here is an excellent 
opportunity for an adequate expres­
sion of beauty. Far more so than
the elaborate productions upon the 
modern stage, because beauty of the 
highest type is never complete. Its 
lure lies in a certain reserve, and be­
hind all is a suggestion of enfoldment. 
Maturity is not the acme of beauty 
because in maturity there is nothing 
more to hope for. Only the incom­
plete, the immature, fills the heart for 
from it we construct the ideal.
The following school officers will 
have full charge of the ball, under 
faculty supervision. H. B. Pearce, 
president; Wallace Smith, first vice 
president; Miss Helen McVey, second 
vice president; William P. Weiss, sec­
retary; M. W. Alley, treasurer, and 
George A. Cook in charge of the pub­
licity.

from last week.
About sixty men, old and “near” 
members came to the informal gather­
ing at the Union Friday last. Last 
year’s stars entertained the try-outers. 
Among them, “Bob” Vey, Sam Mac- 
Nulty, Mr. Hoffman. Mr. Cost and Mr. 
Coe. “Tommy” amused the audience 
with one of his favorites. The new 
men, in gratitude, attempted to sing 
the Chinese national hymn “Wa ta na 
Siam.” Maybe they were right! 
However, the outlook is most encour­
aging!
Specialties, stunts, or peculiarities, 
if you please, are not yet in evidence. 
Will those who have any musical, 
vocal or instrumental, “stunt” please 
call at one of our rehearsals.
Remember that the Clubs offer $5.00 
to anyone who books them a concert 
satisfactory to their manager. Is your 
home-town not interested in securing 
a rousing good, snappy entertainment?
surprised!
Certainly you’ll be surprised at the 
suit values offered in our men’s 
$14.50 Clothes Shop
The suits we’re selling at this price were a surprise to us when first we saw them. We hesitated some time before deciding to take on a standard line selling at such a reasonable price. We feared the quality could not possibly measure up to our stand­ard, but the manufacturer has proven his line and the suits themselves have proven wonders—the tailoring is so perfect—the models so snappy and up-to-the-minute—the materials so much above par, and the quality of the suits as a whole far beyond what we thought was a possibility at such a price.These suits at $14.50 surely re­present a value that but few, if any, can duplicate— they are Pittsburgh’s greatest sellers, and your visit to this department will give you a genuine thrill of surprise, for

that that movement would be a great 
effect in producing the more desirable 
situation for workmen.
The address included an analysis 
of the relation between the workman 
and the engineer. He showed how 
deplorable it is that many concerns 
maintain such a wide gap between the 
engineering department and the 
shops. He also pointed out with ex­
amples how the workman discovers 
and rectifies points that the engineer 
has not recognized, and which can 
not be brought to his attention.
Mr. McNamara pointed out how all 
labor laws had been brought about 
by organized labor, and how the en­
gineers benefited just as much as the 
workmen.
Following the address there was an 
extended open discussion on the sub­
ject of open shops, violation of labor 
laws by manufacturers, the bad effects 
of what may happen in the future. Mr. 
McNamara has hopes that there will 
be a consolidation of all the unions.
Refreshments were served and the 
meeting was enthusiastically declared 
a success.

Science School Notes
A. I. E. E. STUDENT SECTION 
HEARS INTERESTING TALK.
The student section of the A. I.
E. E. were very fortunate in having 
as a speaker, Mr. J. W. Welch of the 
Pittsburgh Railways at the semi­
monthly meeting, October 13. Mr. 
Welsh was the Pittsburgh delegate to 
the convention of the National Asso­
ciation held at Deer Park and his 
talk on that convention was very in­
teresting.
Mr. Welsh gave the members a fine 
idea of how a convention is carried 
on and made everybody anxious to 
aitend such a gathering. The talk 
was enjoyed very much by every one 
and at the conclusion the club gave 
Mr. Welsh a rising vote of thanks 
for his efforts.
ELECTION OF BOARD OF CON­
TROL.
At the close of the general lecture 
on Wednesday, October 13, an elec­
tion was held to fill the vacancy on 
the Board of Control. The position 
was open to members of the Senior 
and Junior classes, the voting being 
done by the three upper classes. A 
large number of candidates were 
nominated for the position. C. L. 
Eaton, Junior Com’l., was elected with 
T. E. Orr, Junior Civil, and C. T. 
Fletcher, Junior Com’l running close 
second.
JUNIOR PROM.
President Kerin of the Junior Class 
has announced that he will appoint 
the committees for the Prom at the 
meeting of the class on Wednesday. 
This will mark the beginning of the 
Junior year. By getting this earlv 
start, sufficient time will be given 
the committees to make the Junior 
Prom a great success.
PLEBE ELECTION.
On Thursday, October 14, the 
Plebe class held its just regular meet­
ing. Election of officers for the first 
semester was the main business of 
the meeting. The results of the elec­
tions showed that the votes were 
rather evenly divided and that the 
winners had but a small plurality. The 
officers are as follows: President,
Paffenbach; vice president, Mason; 
secretary, Armour; treasurer, Beck.
TECH TROPHIES.
More than one student has paused 
before the trophy case in the Science 
Club room and has pundered over the 
question of how all the cups and 
placques came to be there. Very few 
of the students know the why and 
wherefore of all the trophies.
The largest cup is one given by tffe 
Oakland Board of Trade. This cup 
was won by reason of Tech s having 
the best showing of any school in the
Hallowe’en p&rade two years ago. 
The cup was presented at one of the 
general lectures.
Perhaps one of the most interest­
ing trophies is a foot ball which was 
used in the Allegheny game of No­
vember 17, 1906. The score was 6-0 
in favor of Tech.
There are two cups which were won 
by our track team in dual meets with 
the Westinghouse Club; one being 
from March 23, 1912, the other May 
9, 1914.
Another cup represents the su­
premacy of Tech in cheering. This 
cup which was won three times by 
Tech and which thus became our pos­
session, was donated by Elsie Janis 
the popular actress. The competing 
schools were Pitt, Tech, Pittsburgh 
High, and Shadyside. The cheering 
was done at the Nixon when Elsie 
Janis came to Pittsburgh and a spe­
cial night was set aside for schools.
The Plebes are represented in the 
batch of trophies by the trophy won 
in the Plebe Interschool Meet. This 
trophy was won by thé Science 
Plebes.
There are two trophies for the an­
nual Interschool Meet; one from 1913 
presented by the Publicity Bureau 
which was won by Science; and the 
other, also won by Science, which 
was presented by Director Hamer- 
schlag. Science has won the Inter­
school Meet every year until last year 
when the meet was won by the In­
dustries School.
This completes the list of trophies 
in Science, but there are many oth­
ers scattered through the schools. 
The fellows who have never noticed 
these trophies before should give 
them the “once over” and read the in­
scriptions on them.
LAWTOCHFRARIE.
Lawtochfrarie—the honorary Soph­
omore Society of the School of Ap­
plied Science—held its first banquet 
of the year at the Hotel Schenley on 
Thursday evening, the 14th of Oc­
tober. The newly elected members 
from the Class of 1918 were received 
and welcomed by their prdecessors. 
The foundation and purpose of the or­
ganization was explained, and plans 
discussed for a successful year. A 
most agreeable evening was spent in 
which the finest spirit of union and 
loyalty prevailed.
Lawtochfrarie is distinctly an hon­
orary Society, and should be the goal 
of every man in the present Plebe 
class. The purpose of the Society is 
to provide among the entering stu­
dents an incentive for earnest work 
outside of their routine scholastic 
duties. This means active participa­
tion in some of the various activities 
in vogue at school, and does not limit 
itself to athletic achievements. This 
organization offers a suitable medium 
for the expression of class opinion.
Ten Plebes, considered the most 
deserving, will be elected at the end 
of the present school year by the 
active members.
ALLEGHENY BEATEN
Continued from Page 1
in the third quarter the Plaid was 
plainly outplayed, not making one 
first down and being unable to solve 
Allegheny’s attack to the extent that 
the visitors crossed iiie line for their 
single tally.
In Regard To Our Line.
Coach Steffens’ persistent work 
with the line is showing encouraging 
results and soon should result in a 
perfect forward attack and defense. 
In critical positions the line was un­
penetrable and open play was resorted 
to on the side of the visitors. In the 
first of the game the line was the 
weakest factor and iarge holes were 
made in it at will, but the stirring de­
fensive work of Kutz seemed to pro­
vide the necessary stimulus that finally 
unified the work of this department. 
“Doc” Marks has been devoting some 
time to these warriors and is largely 
responsible for the results.
The Game in Detail.
The first score came at the end of 
the first quarter after attacks of both 
teams and an exchange of punts in 
which each side tried the defense of 
the other. Two fumbles were record­
ed for Tech in this period and both 
teams were penalized, due largely to 
the high tension that prevailed be­
tween the old rivals. After a penalty 
of 15 yards against the visitors they 
tried a forward pass that Findlay in­
tercepted on Allegheny’s 40-yard line, 
and carried to the 25-yard mark. Here 
Aultdoerffer made it first down in 
three successive plunges. Kesner lost 
four on the next play and Findlay 
fumbled on the next one, but Kesner 
recovered and on the next play shot 
a forward to Levy for 8 yards. Here 
Aultdoerffer made it first down. Find­
ley advanced 2 and then Aultdoerf­
fer tore to the “one foot” line and 
carried it over between the goal-posts 
on the next play. Kesner kicked goal 
and riot prevailed among the Tech 
supporters while 7-0 appeared on the 
score-board on the hill.
The Second Quarter.
Aultdoerffer stood out in this quar­
ter for his offensive and defensive 
work—fighting his way to first downs 
and also stopping the enemy after 
they had found huge holes in the 
center and left side of the line. Kutz 
and Lauer threw their men for a loss 
on every opportunity and Levy was 
not passed. Kesner put the ball in 
Allegheny’s war-zone by a twenty- 
vard attack off left wing and put the 
ball on the visitors’ 12 yd. mark. A 
penalty and an incomplete forward 
gave the ball to the Meadeville ag­
gregation and a reverse attack was 
launched. In three plunges they 
found holes in the line for an aggre­
gate of nine yards, being stopped each 
time by Aultdoerffer’s wonderful tack­
ling. Allegheny was penalized on the 
next play and forced to kick. Find­
ley received the punt and by a sen­
sational run through the whole op­
posing team, and interfered for by 
Aultdoerffer, Lauer, and Marshal 
made Tech’s second tally near the end 
of the first half. Kesner kicked goal 
and the board registered 14-0 with 
the Plaid on the large end.

Last Half.
During the third period Allegheny 
played her best ball, and not once did 
Tech make a first down. It was in 
this quarter that the visitors made 
their only touchdown, which was indi­
rectly due to a forward pass from Cox 
to Carmont, which netted Allegheny 
42 yards.
To start the third quarter Aultdoerf­
fer kicked off to Bash on the 15 yard 
line, who returned a few yards. Askey 
failed on the next try, but a mo­
ment later gained four yards on a 
buck line. Bash fumbled on the next 
play, but Allegheny recovered, but 
failing to gain on the next try the ball 
went to Tech on downs. Marshall for 
Tech made 10 yards and Allegheny 
drew a penalty of 15 yards for tack­
ling Marshall after being down. The 
ball was on the 15 yard line and from 
here Findlay carried it over for 
Tech’s third touchdown.

vanced 21 yards before being downed. 
Then Bash got three at right guard 
and Askey added one. Here Alle­
gheny made her forward pass, netting 
them 42 yards. The ball was. now on 
Tech’s 18 yard line. Two forward 
passes failed to gaiii for the visitors, 
but the next one, Cox to Arnold, cut 
down the distance to the,-^oal eight 
yards. Two more forward passes 
failed and then the unique play of the 
game was uncorked. Cox’s attempt 
at forward pass was blocked by line­
man, but Cox recovered before the 
ball hit the ground and carried the 
pigskin to Tech’s two yard line. Cox 
failed to gain and Kesner threw Ar­
nold for a two-yard loss. Cox hit 
center for one yard and on the next 
play hit the same spot for Allegheny’s 
lone tally. Bash kicked the goal.
In the last quarter Marshal proved 
the ground-gainer and scored the 
next tally on a thirty-yard run 
through right tackle. The line had 
the idea of opening up now and Mar­
shal’s heady running took him the 
rest of the way. Kesner kicked goal 
and the spectators saw a larger score 
against the visitors than the visitors 
had registered the year before, 28-7. 
Allegheny netted large gains by 
means of forward passes, attempting 
and completing one after another. 
Had it not been for the absolute re­
liability of Aultdoerffer and Hell- 
strom’s ability to follow the ball the 
effect might have been serious.
For the next score Findlay pushed 
Allegheny men and the referee for 
eighteen yards and put the ball in po­
sition for another score where Kes­
ner forwarded to Lauer over the line. 
Kesner failed at goal and the score 
stood 34-7.
For the next score Aultdoerffer 
held the enemy for downs and aided 
by Marshal advanced the ball to Alle­
gheny’s 15 yd. line where Marshal car­
ried it over. Kesner kicked goal and 
the final score was recorded as 41-7, 
a big victory for the Schenley Park 
contingent.
Aultdoerffer.
Aultdoerffer was worn down by his 
strenuous and most brilliant play and
was forced to limp from the fied a
few minutes before the close of the
game. The prettiest and most severe 
and surest tackling of the game must 
be credited to this versatile and 
plucky athlete, the memories of whom 
are going to remain for a long time 
with the loyal Techites.

Continued from Page 2 
it has been the custom for the class 
to ballot until some member secures 
over 50 per cent of the votes cast. 
That is, under this system the candi­
dates are slowly but surely eliminated 
and the field is at last narrowed down 
to possibly two men. Therefore, the 
friends of this system argue, you get 
a chance to vote for several men for 
the same office. Thus, if your candi­
date is eliminated, you have the pleas­
ant task—opportunity, some of the 
revolutionists call it—of voting, not 
for your choice, understand, but for 
that of your classmate. In an elec­
tion, so important to every Senior 
with the smallest grain of “pep” in his 
system, every man who has enough 
backbone to come to the election has 
made up his mind beforehand just 
who he intends to support. Then, 
pray tell me, if such a man is not con­
tent to vote his ballot once—for good 
and forever—for the man he is willing 
to vouch for? It is all bunkem of the 
trashiest kind to say that any man 
will be content to vote on a second 
ballot for a man as a second choice. 
You are either for a man or you are 
against him, and who respects the 
speciman that rides the fence?
The present Senior class saw the 
folly of this elimination proposition, 
the class at least voted it down. But 
I am extremely sorry to say that the 
old plurality system, which has long 
been practiced in all other elections, 
was defeated by a very close decision. 
And in the resulting confusion and 
excitement, a compromise bill was 
rushed forward. On the spur of the 
moment, and as a result of little or no 
consideration, it was hastily passed. 
The latter provided that the three men 
having the highest vote on the first 
ballot should again be candidates on 
a second and final ballot. Thus, it 
might be said, that two elections were 
held, the first being the ordinary, fa­
miliar, plurality method. The second 
ballot was held after all but three 
men were eliminated. Now, complete 
returns of the second ballot show con­
clusively that 44.4 per cent of the Sen­
ior class were compelled to change 
their choice as a result of the elimin­
ation of four of the candidates. Now, 
can any clear thinking person argue 
that this decision, formed immediate­
ly after the close of the first contest 
will have the same weight and the 
same sincere intention behind it as 
that indicated by the first ballot, 
which was the result of each indi­
vidual’s thought and attention during 
the entire preceding week?
To make a long story short, the 
vote on the first ballot went to Messrs. 
Shea, Ingalls, and Henning in the

order named. But the elimination 
completely overturned the first deci­
sion of the class, and the results fa­
vored Henning, Shea, and Ingalls in 
the order named. As I have already 
stated, I believe that the plurality 
vote system is the only one that gives 
every man fair deal and a square deal, 
and I still contend that the first bal­
lot in the present election shows more 
completely, more fairly, and more sin­
cerely, what decision the class had 
arrived at after a week’s careful scru­
tiny and study of the men in the field. 
In saying what I have written here,
I realize that I am throwing myself 
in the face of sarcastic ridicule, and in 
doing so I hereby make myself eli­
gible for the Amalgamated Soreheads 
and Downandouters Club. At the 
same time I think of the remark that 
Cheer Leader Merrill made in regard 
to the last game with Pitt: “We won, 
fellows, even if the score doesn’t show 
it.” Now I think that it is possible 
for one candidate to win the election 
under the present system, even if the 
returns don’t back him up.
All of this brings me to my point 
and my conclusion. My point is this: 
that I am neither considering per­
sonality nor am I attacking 
any individual or individuals. I 
am merely presenting my ar­
gument against what I believe is 
a very poor system of controlling 
elections. And my conclusion is this: 
that I make this appeal to Science 
Juniors not to wait until the eleventh 
hour to settle the question of what 
election system you intend to use. 
Talk it over now. Do something 
about it. And above all, profit by the 
experience of other classes, and try to 
avoid the unpleasant circumstances 
that are sure to arise if you are negli­
gent in this matter.
Respectfully yours,
