Committee Chairmen Appointed 
For Spring Student Council
Byrne Proposes Constitutional Amendment 
Admitting First Semester Freshmen To SC
' Committee appointments constituted the major order of business 
in Student Council meeting last Wednesday. Shirlee Ploeger, new 
SC president, announced the following new committee chairmen: 
Bob Mair, publications; Bob Maxton, social; Marilyn Seiner, elections; 
Bob Byrne, freshman regulations 
Irv Shecter, points and keys; Dot- 
tie Malone, permanent decorations;
Larry Glavin, special; Bill Stew­
art, plans and programs; Mary 
Lou Maurhoff, class organizations;
Dick Durstine, by-laws; and Ray 
Sebulsky, assistant budget chair­
man. These appointments were 
approved by Council.
Legality Questioned 
Ronnie Curhan raised some 
question as to the appointment of 
Sebulsky as assistant budget 
ehairman, since he would in effect 
be taking over the job. The pres- 
budget chairman, Phil Eck-ent „ ,
man, will resign his job shortly. 
Sebulsky, a new member of Coun­
cil, by virtue of his duties would 
become a member of the execu­
tive committee. The point Curhan 
raised was whether or not the as­
sistant chairman could legally as­
sume that position.
Curhan then moved that in the 
event of the resignation of the 
budget chairman the assistant 
chairman would assume that posi­
tion. This motion was of doubtful 
constitutionality and was tabled 
for action at the next meeting.
Bob Byrne proposed an amend­
ment to the constitution that 
Would allow first-semester fresh­
men to run for Council. In accord­
ance with constitutional proced­
ure, this motion was tabled and 
""’ill be acted upon at the next 
meeting.
Party Plans
•lu a lighter vein, SC considered
plans for a Council party. Al­
though no definite plans were 
made, a motion by Curhan that 
the party be financed by the mem­
bers themselves was unanimously 
passed.
Three Council representatives 
plan to conduct informal Investi­
gations of situations they think 
could start improvement or 
change. Don Hand will look into 
the matter of repairing the road 
behind the barracks, and Norma 
Trust plans to consider the prob­
lem of increasing student parking 
facilities. Bob Byrne also said he 
intends to see what can be done 
about classifying modern lan-

fice on which she will list her 
preferences. The ballot must be 
in the office by 10:30 a.m. 
Monday, March 3, 1952. Any girl 
who does not submit her ballot of 
preference by that time will not be 
accepted until the next rushing 
season, unless otherwise indicated 
to the Dean of Women. It is very 
to fill in all preferences, 
of the sororities and 
rushees will then be matched

must answer with written accept­
ance or regret by 5:00 p.m. Mon­
day, March 3, 1952.
Any girl who fails to file a bal­
lot on time or pick up her bid on 
time will be considered ineligible 
to join a sorority until the next 
formal rushing period. Also, any 
girl who fails to make a reply on 
time will be considered ineligible 
to join a sorority for one rushing 
season.
Finally, a rushee shall not, un­
der any circumstances, expect or 
accept a bid to a sorority before
4:30 p.m. March 3, 1952, nor shall 
a sorority make any commitments 
to a rushee.

Open to All CIT
Sorority Women
Sophomore and junior sorority 
girls who are interested in ob­
taining Pittsburgh PanheUenic As­
sociation scholarships are eligible 
to compete with sorority girls on 
all the Pittsburgh campuses. How­
ever, Dean Schaefer wishes to re­
mind those thinking of entering 
the contest to fill out applications 
and return them immediately to 
her office.
Since at least two -or three^Car- 
negie girls in the past have been 
awarded the scholarships, it is de­
sirable that CIT have a good rep­
resentation this year as well.
Greek Week 
Fame Spreads
Program To Eliminate 
“Hell Weeks” In Frats
By Fred Sonnenberg
Since the suggestion by the Na­
tional Interfraternity Council that 
the college fraternities adopt some 
form of community “help week” 
or Greek week to promote their 
standing in the community and 
eliminate the scholastic complica­
tions that usually result from “Hell 
weeks”, individual chapters or 
whole campuses have begun to or­
ganize “help weeks”, many for 
this year’s pledges.
Probably the first national men­
tion of this program was in the 
“Readers Digest” about a year ago, 
when it discussed the program 
adopted by the ATO’s at Indiana. 
This article caused much discus­
sion by fraternities, college offi­
cials, civic leaders, and parents.
Justify Derferments
At the meeting of the National 
Interfraternity Council this 
Thanksgiving, it was suggested by 
the IFC officers that the college 
chapters begin to think about such 
a program; and the featured 
speaker on the program, a repre-

Campus Social Life Sloived 
As Virus Creeps In Morewood
What is the malady that’s taking a sight-seeing tour of More- 
wood Gardens? Whatever it is, it doesn’t need a telescope! Is it 
Omicron and his super-positronic viruses swooping down upon our 
defenseless women, or has some witch doctor over at PCW been 
sticking pins in the little CIT dol-#----------------------------------------------------------
lies?
As soon as one crossed the More- 
wood threshold last week-end, he 
(or she) was either trampled by a 
stampede of distraught ladies car­
rying suitcases; or confronted by 
other members of the Ladies’ Aide 
carrying trays upstairs with as­
sortments of diets ranging from 
soft foods and broths for those 
who had enough strength to sip 
through staws, down to germicides 
for the hopeless cases.
Doctors invaded the premises 
with flasks of unknown substances, 
because the nurse was also an un­
fortunate victim of the virus. Even 
the abode of the kitchen became 
infested with the. monster, so cafe­
teria service resulted.
The popular expression among 
the girls of Morewood, “Do you 
have a date tonight?”, has been 
reworded a little to, “Dc you have 
a virus tonight?” Of course in 
some girls’ opinions there isn’t 
much difference.
What is the fate of the More­
wood girls? Should they stay and 
play Florence Nightingale to their 
friends and eventually land in the 
happy-hunting ground, or should
they pack up their bags for Tim- 
buctu? This last solution might 
stop the virus from spreading 
down fraternity row.

The next active meeting of 
Scabbard and Blade will be 
held on Tuesday, March 4, at 
11:30 a.m. in room 232-F Ad­
ministration Hall.

2TACTANTUESDAY, FEBRUARY 26, 1952
Editorials—
Between Two Fires
Rising costs and fixed or falling incomes have put many 
of the country’s independent, non-state supported colleges, 
of which Carnegie is one, in dire financial straights. Some 
have been forced to close their doors or greatly curtail opera­
tions, while others can be expected to follow suit shortly 
unless new sources of funds become available.
This is the atmosphere in which the National Associa­
tion of Manufacturers recently formed a resolution reading: 
“Business enterprises must find a way to support the whole 
educational program—effectively, regularly, and now.” The 
association called on its 17,000 member companies to con­
tinue efforts to secure adequate local, state, and private 
support for elementary and secondary schools, and to exert 
every effort to make available to higher education the sup­
plementary private financial support essential to meet 
present educational needs. The only alternative, says the 
NAM, to further governmental aid to education “with its 
grave implications to academic freedom” lies in help from 
business interests
Active adoption of this resolution could certainly ease 
the present burden on the shoulders of private education, 
but one wonders whether the sudden show of mass-altruism 
on the part of businessmen is not tinged with more subtle 
motives. Though the present rash of loyalty oaths, textbook 
supervisions, and unfounded legislative investigations cer­
tainly restrict academic freedom little would be gained by 
a change in the hand that holds the purse-strings unless the 
new keepers of the coin took a definite hands-off policy to­
ward the faculty and curricula of supported schools. It is 
at least doubtful that the NAM would be willing to adopt 
such a policy.
Living under increasing governmental supervision of 
their activities, businessmen may have reasoned that a won­
derful way to swing the pendulum back is directed educa­
tion through industry-supported schools. Not only must in­
dustry guarantee its supply of technical personnel, but it 
must also promote attitudes favorable toward the present 
industrial system through the humanity and social sciences. 
And financial backing for these goals is particularly pain­
less at present, when profits are eaten up by taxes anyway.
Support for this view comes from a recent address by 
Irving S. Olds, chairman of the board of the U. S. Steel 
Corporation, who stated that, “the most difficult problems 
which American enterprise faces today are neither techni­
cal nor scientific, but lie chiefly in the realm of what is 
embraced in a liberal arts education.” One wonders what 
sort of liberal arts education Mr. Olds and the NAM would 
favor.
It may be that we have judged businessmen to severly, 
and, after all, we can hardly blame them for seeking to 
protect their interests. But before private education ac­
cepts mass-subsidies from industry, it would be well to con­
sider the possible effects such subsidies might have on 
academic freedom. Private institutions may soon face the 
dilemma of being able to obtain needed funds only with the 
sacrifice of much of the cherished freedom of action which 
separates them from most of the state supported schools.

Week of Brotherhood
By Deck di Salvo
We have just wandered through Brotherhood Week; like the 
Christmas season, where love somehow sneaks upon the world for 
several hours of Christmas Eve, this last week has found the world 
the selected week is over, I sup-+ 
pose we shouldn’t talk about such 
distasteful things as prejudice and 
organized groups for prejudice, 
but we will anyway.
This word “tolerance” is a dis­
gusting word. It connotes a won­
derful smug superiority; so I sug­
gest we examine the case against 
prejudice with understanding and 
with love. The first great problem 
that we face as individuals and 
especially as groups is that of re­
ligious intolerance. Personally and 
groupwise we draw our charters of 
exclusion on this question. I was 
an active fraternity man on an­
other campus. I belonged to a 
group founded on the principal 
of Christian Brotherhood, and yet 
Jesus Christ could not have been 
my brother because He was a Jew.
On every side of us were other 
groups. Shubert, Columbus, Coper­
nicus, Dante, Newman and 
Michaelangelo could not have be­
longed to most of those groups 
because they were Catholics.
Luther, Schwitzer, Kant, Wash­
ington, and Roosevelt could not 
have belong to some because they 
were simply Protestants—and so 
the litany goes on! Little men of 
little minds excluding all the rich­
ness of creation—their fellow man!
The Racial Issue 
Perhaps the greatest finger 
pointing in this case against intol­
erance is in the racial issue. It is 
most ironic, as Mister Spengler 
suggests, that the black and brown 
and yellow and red men will soon 
dominate the earth. Our groups 
and individuals long cherishing 
the motion of white superiority 
may soon find comfort only in 
superiority to the beasts. A won­
derful reversal! We who suggest­
ed to the black, the brown, the 
yellow' and red men that they 
take comfort in their exalted po­
sition between us and the animals, 
now may find that turn about is 
our fair play. I hope that in the 
patient wisdom of the Negro, the 
Chinese,, the Indian, and Arab 
peoples there will be the grace of 
understanding we have not yet ac­
quired. We, who by chance were 
born white.
Issue of Snobbery 
The third great issue is that oi 
snobbery. Last year I had the 
pleasure of passing through sev­
eral sorority parties at the Union 
With cigarette holders at the pro­
per position of politeness; tea cups
precariously balanced at the so­
cially acceptable angle, our sisters 
were weeding out the quiet 
mouses, the poor mouses, and 
those socially unfit to be a snob. 
It must be admitted that our 
choice of friends is selective, but 
if there must be groups and if one 
person in them profess the 
Christian or Jewish ethic then 
surely—that selectivity must be 
based on the dignity of the indi­
vidual. In our every day world we 
unfortunately meet to use and not 
to learn from or help. We seem 
most particular about background 
or money and so blind to goodness. 
We ignor the very basis of 
Christianity—for Christ was not 
a snob.
Generous With Ideals 
In our personal or group’s re­
lations a man’s religious, color, or 
financial status cannot be the 
judge of our selectivity, if we as 
people, as a nation or a race are 
to mature and survive. If the 
Western Man is to meet the chal­
lenge of these times there must 
be the universal brotherhood of 
all men for the sake of goodness 
in the cause of love. Ideals are 
usually generously given; rarely 
well received. Prejudice is some­
thing we can work and act against 
here in our college life. No 
Christian man or woman can call 
hinïself or herself a Christian and 
subscribe to the case of prejudice 
The young man asked the Master, 
“And who is my brother?” The 
Master answered that every crea­
ture on the earth is our brother.

Interested Reader 
Scores di Salvo’s 
Concept Of Truth
Editor, the Tartan:
I thank Deek di Salvo for his 
trouble in answering my letter of 
February 12. But after wading 
through the verbiage of his re­
ply, I still find a few points on 
which I disagree.
First of all, the di Salvian tune 
has changed somewhat. A com­
parison of his two articles will 
show that. In my reply, I shall 
mention only his most recent as­
sertions, since they no doubt sup­
plant the first, the tone (if not the 
intent) of which he seems to have 
modified.
My answer is as follows:
1. While Dante, Bacon, and St. 
Francis were all no doubt men of 
great merit, let us stick to the 
qualities of societies In general in 
our thoughts. It is not fair for di 
Salvo to attack the 20th century as 
a whole and at the same time 
praise the 13th on the grounds that 
it produced three great men.
2. I said that religion is thriv­
ing, and I will say it again. The 
churches are full, a thing which 
would not have been the case in 
a society of spiritual and moral 
bankrupts such as di Salvo im­
plies we' are. True, we have an 
ample share of hypocrisy. But 
there must be a strain of spiritual­
ism strong enough to draw the 
hypocrites to the temples. They 
certainly do not go there for en­
tertainment.
3. If Mr. di Salvo believes me 
to be a compartmentalist, he has, 
I hope, misunderstood. My letter, 
if it implied as much, did so only 
because of my desire to refute the 
rather drastic statement of his 
earlier article, “The God That 
Failed,” which statements have to 
a great extent been altered by his 
latest publication.
I am just as anxious for an in­
tergrated philosophy as he; but 
his earlier statements did not 
speak of integration; they spoke 
only anti-science.
4. Di Salvo says “Truth does not 
change.” But this does not mean 
that what we believe to be the 
truth cannot change. Perhaps the 
ancients were mistaken. Perhaps 
we do not know the truth at all—, 
about anything. We may all be 
wrong — way wrong — even di 
SalvO.
So let us experiment and ob­
serve, and improve on our con­
cept of the truth—the truth that 
does not change. Di Salvo speaks 
as if we knew the truth already. 
We do not.
5. It is in his subtle final para­
graph that di Salvo hints fhat the 
solutions to our problem is al­
ready supplied and set down in 
black and white—that the truth, 
the whole truth, was revealed 
thousands of years ago. Was this 
revelation one of “integration” of 
science and religion? How do we 
know it to be the truth? We do 
not know.
We are only searchers; we shall 
always be searchers. But we must 
search more diligently.
Yours truly
Interested Reader.

INTERESTED
in YOURSELF?
WE HOPE YOU ARE, because it takes an engineer with self- 
interest to meet challenging problems and we have engineering 
problems as tough as any you’ll find.
WE LOOK FOR MEN interested in themselves because healthy 
self-esteem makes a man want to show what he can do. People 
who merely want a job won’t give us the fr^sh ideas that are 
the life’s blood of our industrial instrumentation business. Its the 
ambitious, driving engineers that are solving todays complex in­
dustrial process problems through automatic controls and sys­
tems. Why don’t YOU put your self interest to work solving to­
morrow’s problems in this varied, challenging, interesting field?

Saxonburg Cyclotron Site 
Is Miniature Campus-In-Itself
Dorms, Shops, Labs Make Nuclear Research 
Center Almost A Self-Sufficient Community
By Bill Smith
Near Saxonburg, Pennsylvania, some 30 odd miles upstate, lies 
the CIT Nuclear Research Center, home of the much publicized Car­
negie cyclotron. The center, a miniature campus in itself, com­
plete with living quarters and dining facilities, is an extension of 
the physics department designed ?- 
to give graduate and post-doctor­
ate students an opportunity to 
more fully explore the world of 
the atom.
Ground was broken for the Cen­
ter on March 12, 1948. The area, 
which formed the original site of 
radio station KDKA, totals 73 
acres, 20 of which are used for op­
erations with the rest turned back 
to the plow. To transport work­
ers, professors, and students from 
the campus proper to the research 
center, three station wagons run 
on a regular bus-like schedule.
Creutz Directs 
Direction of the research project 
falls to Dr. Edward C. Creutz and 
business administrator J. H. Cole­
man, who have the assistance of 
some 65 technical and non-tech- 
nical permanent workers. To keep 
such an operation self-sufficient 
requires the services of half A doz­
en administrative personnel, nine 
machinists, an auto mechanic, 
plumbers, draftsmen, electronics 
experts, etc. About a dozen build­
ings of varying shapes and sizes 
supply 22,000 square feet of floor 
space for the work of the Center.
Exceptional living accomoda­
tions are provided for single stu­
dents in a brand new 20 man dorm 
complete with lounge, kitchen, and 
dining room. Married students and 
their families live in two remod­
eled quonset huts which were for­
merly located on campus near 
Jones Hall.
AEC Financed 
Funds to start the Center were 
provided by the Buhl Foundation, 
the Office of Naval Research, and 
Carnegie Tech. Now CIT owns and 
operates the buildings with funds 
from an Atomic Energy Commis­
sion contract.
Composed entirely of research 
labs and shops, except for the 
dorms and a seminar room, the 
Center works on projects for the 
AEC and then reports its findings 
to the Commission. The much dis­
cussed “proton synchro-eyclotron” 
was put into operation a few 
months ago and is now being “tun­
ed up.”

Dr. E. C. Creutz
Heads Project
During construction of the 
1500 ton cyclotron, the rest of the 
Center was not idle. Equipment to 
be used in conjunction with the 
cyclotron was (and is) built in the 
lab. Research on natural radioac­
tive substances is also conducted 
at the Center. A special branch of 
the chemistry department known 
as the “hot lab” is being built to 
study the chemistry of radioactive 
substances.
Fast Business
Dr. Sergio De Benedetti is su­
pervising projects on super fast 
coincident techniques in positron 
annihilation studies and scintilla­
tion counter problems involving 
processes that occur in less than 
a millionth of a second. At present, 
electronic equipment can handle 
time down to 10 to the minus 
nine power seconds.
The Center resembles an indus­
trial plant in many respects, with 
a great deal of shop machinery and 
special electronic equipment. It 
was designed with an eye for saf­
ety—radiation, fire, and otherwise 
—even down to an emergency 
shower in the main hall to mini­
mize the effect of an accidental 
burn. A complete library is main­
tained to provide the best refer­
ence information. In short, the 
Nuclear Research Center is a well 
established, self sufficient—though 
far distanst—branch of Carnegie 
Tech.

Astle, Gough, Demas, and Kra­

Case, W&J Mermen
The Tartan tankers bowled over two teams bent on upset vic­
tories last week, as they squeezed by W & J 49-35 on Wednesday, and 
edged the Rough Riders from Case 47-37 on Friday afternoon.
In the Case meet, the Plaid relay of Tom Astle, Chuck Gough, 
Dick Kramer and Nick Demasi-------------------------------------------------------—
swam to a close victory in the 
amazingly low time of 3:52.5, be­
lieved to be the lowest time re­

Much of the credit goes to Dick

Plaid Cops Relay
The meet was close throughout, 
and the points evenly distributed 
individual events, but the 
took the relays.
¦ the medley relay of Bob 
Coulter, Bill Aiken, and Chuck 
Gough jumped off to a win, Dick 
Kramer was nosed out in the 220 
by Frank Matter. The 50 yard 
dash turned out to be an easy 
victory for Nick Demas, but Tom 
Astle suffered a setback as he 
was edged from second place by 
Herb Field of Case.
In the individual medley, Tom 
Freeman paced John Hirsch of 
Case for the first four lengths, but 
faded and Hirsch went on to win. 
Rod Macdonald nipped Freeman 
to give the Tartans second and 
third. Grey Duncan easily out­
classed his opponents in the div­
ing events, despite what both 
teams thought to be low awards 
for his dives.

Humble Allegheny 67-55
Earlier 53-48 Defeat In Field House Contest 
Brings Season Record To 11-9; Three To Go
Pitt closed its basketball season in its new field house by 
humbling the over-confident Tartans 53-48 last Wednesday; the Plaid
then returned to the Skibo gym and drubbed Allegheny 67-55 on
Saturday. / ?----------------------------------------------------------
Zone Checks Plaid 
The Gators, from Meadville, 
closed up the Tartan home season 
with a hard fought, scrappy zone 
defense that held the Plaid well 
in check during the first half. Re­
peated fast breaks during the per­
iod were all that enabled the home 
team to maintain its slight mar­
gin until halftime.
Beck opened the game wide dur­
ing the third quarter with a suc­
cession of accurate set shots which 
the vistor’s tight zone couldn’t 
handle. Holste and Craig took ad­
vantage of the loosened defense 
and made good on several close- 
in layups.
Melndoe and Buck led the Alle­
gheny scoring parade with sev­
eral timely pivot shots from the 
key position. Snyder, a Gator 
guard, although low scorer, was a 
constant hazard to the Plaid drib­
blers and on several occasions set 
up some important, but futile, 
scoring attempts.
Panthers Outlast Tartans 
Pitt’s scoring aces, Zemich and 
Dietrick, with 13 and 16 points 
respectively, managed to stifle 
Tartan aspirations for victory 
number 11 last Wednesday even­
ing at the field house. Although 
Carnegie led the Jungle Cats go­
ing into the last quarter, they 
tired and Pitt’s zone defense af- 
foi^cc- inem no opportunities.
The score was tied for the third 
time, 6-6, in the initial period 
when Holste sank a shot for two 
points and from that time the Pan­
thers were held scoreless until the 
whistle blew, giving the Plaid a

In Penn-Ohio 
This Saturday
Next Sunday the campus will be 
flooded with swimmers from seven 
colleges in what is hoped will be a 
vain effort to wrest the Penn-Ohio 
championship away from the Skibo 
mermen.
Coach Claude Sofield, vice pres­
ident of the coaches’ association, 
reports that he expects Allegheny, 
Case, Edinboro, Slippery Rock, 
Westminster, and W & J before 
11:00 a.m., when the preliminaries 
will be held in the individual 
events.
At two in the afternoon, the top 
swimmers and the relay teams will 
vie for places, points, and the 
championship. This year’s meet is 
expected to be very close, with 
Case and W&J, last year’s weaker 
teams, showing much improve­
ment.
The meet will feature such out­
standing stars as the Tartan sprint 
ace Nick Demas, distance man 
Dick Kramer, and diver Grey

Frank Sciulli A Well-Known 
Figure To All Carnegie Athletes
All the thousands of male Carnegie students who have used 
CIT gym during the past 11 years, plus many more persons 
have attended Tartan home baseball games, are acquainted with 
“Frank,” the guardian of the gym towel room, ticket collector, and
general handyman for the physical ?-------------------
education department.
His full name is Frank Sciulli 
(pronounced Shooley), but the 
first name is the only one most 
people ever learn. And there are a 
great many who have passed along 
that corridor from the locker room 
to the showers and back in the 
years since May, 1941, when he 
first took up his post in the gym.
Sports Fan Extraordinary 
Frank came to rainy Pittsburgh 
from sunny Italy in 1914, and in 
1924 started work in the carpentry 
shops that once were part of In­
dustries Hall. He lives in Pitts­
burgh, is married, and has four 
children.
As a sports fan, Frank is 
equalled by few. He attends all 
Tartan contests at home, and trav­
els with the football team to the 
out of town contests as well. He 
is also a lover of all professional 
Pittsburgh athletics, and during 
off hours serves as an usher for 
Pirate games at Forbes field.
In the years since 1924, he has 
seen a lot of Carnegie athletes 
come and go, but still remembers 
All American quarterback Harry 
Harpster, who graduated in 1928, 
as the greatest football star of 
them all. Among the schools bas­
ketball titans, he rates Coach Mel 
Cratsley at the top.
A Million Towels 
The towel business at CIT is a 
thriving one, and about 500 pieces 
per day pass through the window 
clean only to return dirty within 
a few minutes. In a little over 10 
years, that makes close to a mil­
lion customers at the towel desk 
(count them).
Sitting at that window gives 
Frank a good chance to survey the 
scene and make an estimate of the 
students at this institution as they 
parade before him in their skin­
tight suits. Most of them (that’s 
us, gentlemen) are good boys, he 
says, but “there are a few rotten 
apples in every barrel.”
Paragon of Efficiency 
But his job requires a. lot more 
than sitting at a window and 
! watching towels. Any sort of work 
j around the department, from 
mending equipment and laying out
showed his speed by taking the 
100 yd. event in 56.3. Carnegie 
men could not manage a first in 
either the backstroke or breast­
stroke, but Coulter and Aiken 
chalked up two seconds for need­
ed points.
The 440 race amazed everyone, 
turning out to be two races down 
to the wire. For top honors Tar­
tan Phil Drew nosed out Erie 
Cornell of Case; in the race for 
third Neil Houston lost a close call 
to Anderson, the C ?ntry.
In the W&J me^L on Wednes­
day, Coach Sofield tried to set a 
new pool record in the first con­
test, the medley relay, as Nick De­
mas anchored behind Bill Aiken 
and Bob Coulter. The combina­
tion failed to set a record, but 
easily beat the Presidents’ highly 
publicized team.
Three-Way, Tie 
Dick Kramer followed with a 
lopsided victory in the 220, the 
first of three wins which he con-» 
tributed. Without Demas, the Ski- 
bos dropped the 50 yd. dash, but 
freshmen Gough and Dave Chid- 
ester copped second and third for 
the Plaid.
Grey Duncan again took the 
diving in an easy fashion. After 
thè break for diving, Demas 
coasted to a win in the 100 and 
Astle took third.
All Tied Up 
The score was tied at 34-34 
when Kramer and Drew breezed 
away with the 440 to give Carne- 
negie 42 points. W&J could have 
by winning the
FRANK SCIULLI photo by Snyderma*
The athletic department’s familiar equipment custodian and man- 
of-all work poses within his stronghold, the men’s gym supply room. 
Frank, an ardent Tartan fan, has been with the school since 1924«
softball fields to repairing crippled 
furniture may fall to him. Frank 
is responsible for the maintenance 
of all athletic equipment, and in a 
decade on the job he has become 
well known for his great efficiency.
As far as the towel room is con­
cerned, if one towel disappears per 
week, the department begins to 
suspect a crime wave, for the 
school’s equipment is pretty safe 
while under the careful super­
vision of Frank Sciulli.

By Dick Durstine
Back in the days when the spangled wilderness had not yet 
been altogether disrobed from the mountains of the West, there was 
in the city of Pittsburgh a mound. Perhaps you would even have 
called it a hill. This point depends mainly on whether you live in 
Switzerland or Kansas.
But that mound is no longer 
there. In place of it are, among 
other things, Skibo, Administra­
tion Hall, and Fine Arts.
While it still stood, the top of 
the mound was used as a football 
field, and suitably enough, the 
field was equipped with a field 
house.
A Varied Career
Now all this may seem obvious 
and rather silly, but that field 
house and its varied career are 
of some interest to us. Originally 
it functioned as an office for the 
construction contractor during the 
erection of the now defunct In­
dustries Hall. Next it was used by 
the architect for the building of 
the school, and in 1906 it gradu­
ated to the role of field house.
But that was not the end of it. 
This little frame building con­
tinued to serve the school, as a 
class building for civil engineers 
and night school architects, (now 
called the “Shanty”), as a car­
penter shop and a plumber’s shop. 
And, after the hill on which it 
rested had been removed and 
dumped into Skibo Bowl (which 
used to be some 25 feet deeper 
than it is today), it was eventually 
moved to the end of Skibo, in 
which position it has served as a 
faculty club since 1933.
A Word on Skibo
So the first building at Carnegie 
Tech, a supposedly temporary one, 
has in nearly 50 years become the 
oldest and most permanent struc­
ture on the campus.
Also of a supposedly temporary 
nature is the Shanty’s neighbor, 
Skibo, which likewise occupies 
some of the space once consumed 
by the mound.
Reliable sources tell us that Ski­
bo was erected (in only 23 days) 
after the hall had been removed, 
and was not uncovered ducing the 
excavations, as some believe.
The Langley Laboratory
Today, when we walk into the 
stately cafeteria for a bowl of fern 
fronds and a glass of yoghurt, and 
gaze up at the beautiful Gothic 
tracery of the windows and the 
graceful vaulted ceiling, we would 
hardly suspect that the place was 
once an airplane (or aeroplane) 
hangar. But in the room where 
broiled steaks are cooked to or-

der, and men in white coats push 
unweildly carts around the floor 
(probably in preparation for the 
Spring Carnival buggy race), the 
Langely Laboratory of Aeronau­
tics once existed.
Pomp and Circumstance 
The building was built in 1918, 
and was dedicated on April 2 with 
a maximum of pomp and circum­
stance. Since then it has, under 
<5ne name or another, played an 
important role on campus, up to 
the present day, when it is used 
as a cafeteria, studio, supply room, 
meeting place, and source for fra­
ternity silverware.
» So two temporary buildings live 
on, each serving far afield from 
its original purpose.

gineer after all.

When Bob Maxton, social chair­

the point was also raised that the

April 19 all without the knowledge 
or approval of Council. An inves­

conducted and a report will be

Valentine Roses Dead-- 
So Are Our Wallets!
By Lloyd W. Dyer. Jr.
The Valentine roses are wilted, but since the unpaid florist bills 
still weigh heavy on suitors souls, it may still be appropriate to 
look beyond the hearts and flowers to the origins of the strange 
and expensive custom.
When Rome still ruled the 
world, the average male could get 
by with a small note to the lady 
of his choice, but since 1867 a more 
concrete token of esteem has be­
come customary. In that year an 
enterprising gentleman, a callous 
man caring for naught but gain, 
initiated the policy so detrimental 
to young men’s pocketbooks.
Old Customs 
He promoted the sale of boxes 
containing millinery, singing birds, 
scents, and candy; and women 
seized eagerly upon the innova­
tion and perpetuated it.
Though the origin of Valentine’s 
Day is unknown, several theories 
have been advanced. Among the
Romans it was customary for 
young boys to draw the names of 
their female companions for the 
Feast of Februata Juana (Febru­
ary 13). This pagan custom offend­
ed the Christian priesthood be­
cause of some of the rather un­
toward practices which went on 
during this holiday, and the names 
of saints were substituted for 
those of possible sweethearts.
Another theory is that associa­
tion grew out of the similarity be­
tween the Norman word “galatin,” 
meaning lover of women, and the 
name of a saint. It is thought that 
“Galatin’s Day” with the initial 
“G” frequently mispronounced as 
“V” led to the confusion in the 
popular mind.

are wearing Manhattan Sportshirts. The reason is as 
simple as a snap course. Manhattan Sportshirts are style- 
right, handsomely tailored, and so darned comfortable 
you just hate to take ’em off. Manhattan has them in long 
and short sleeves ... in a wide variety of colors and 
patterns all in the finest fabrics. All are the sportiest you 
could put on your back when you want to take it easy!

What Gives?
This reporter was given ten tickets to sell for the Gay 
Nineties dance. I personally asked sixty Evening students 
to buy. I sold three tickets. Three divided by sixty gives 
me a batting average of only five percent—hardly anything 
to crow about. Luckily, this reporter does not have to earn 
a living selling tickets, but it is discouraging to encounter 
such a lack of school spirit.
Evening Student Council, and especially the Social 
Chairman (Bill Bartoli) put a lot of work into preparing 
these dances. They do get people to go to these dances, and 
these people certainly must enjoy themselves because they 
always come back. However, this group is only a small per­
centage of the entire evening student body. The problem is, 
why aren’t more of the others coming? This reporter as 
well as the Student Council social chairman would certain­
ly like to hear some views expressed on this subject. Letters 
addressed to “Plaid Editor, Box 256, CIT” deposited postage 
free in the slot by the post office near the Book Store will 
be welcomed.

Evening School 
Students Enjoy 
Nineties Dance
A really enjoyable evening of 
dancing was had by those who at­
tended the Gay Nineties dance on 
Saturday, February 23, in Thistle 
Hall. Skip Nelson, vocalist for Wes 
Parker, turned out out be a celeb­
rity in his own right. Skip has 
sung for Glenn Miller, Dorsey, and 
Guy Lombardo.
The girl with the most striking 
Gay Nineties hat was Dolores 
Roosz. She was awarded a novelty 
weather guide as a prize.
Ralph Gessner held the lucky 
number for the door prize. He re­
ceived a valuable prize of cuff 
links and matching ear rings. This 
prize was presented by James 
Frappe, former evening school 
student, a well-known jewelry 
designer.
Mr. and Mrs. McKelway, and 
Mr. and Mrs. Daniels were the 
gracious chaperones of the even­
ing. It was worth the price of the 
-admission to see the men in the 
bowler hats and mustaschios.
Decorations were very apropos 
to the occasion. Special credit goes 
to Ginny Ross who was responsi­
ble for the novel decoration of the 
dance floor.

Evening Newman Club 
Plans Now Under Way
During an interview of Father J. Regis Berkmyre, chaplain ot 
Carnegie Tech’s day school Newman Club, and Marilyn Sweeney, 
president, the organizing of a night school chapter was discussed. 
The purpose of Newman Clubs is to deepen the spiritual and enrich 
the temporal lives of members ?-
through a balanced program of re­
ligious, intellectual, and social ac­
tivities.
Father Berkmyre said that it 
was not only possible, but desir­
able that such an organization be 
formed. Therefore an invitation is 
being extended to all Catholic 
evening students who are inter­
ested to meet for a short time Fri­
day evening, March 7, at 10:30

The difference between “just smoking” and really enjoying your 
smoke is the taste of a cigarette. You can taste the difference in the ¦ 
smoother, mellower, more enjoyable taste of a Lucky ... for two 
important reasons. First, L.S./M.F.T.—Lucky Strike means fine 
tobacco ... fine, mild tobacco that tastes better. Second, Luckies 
are made to taste better... proved best-made of all five principal 
brands. So reach for a Lucky. Enjoy the cigarette that tastes

‘Greek Week9 Sweeps Colleges
fContivued from page I]
«entative of the Selective Service 
office in Washington, pointed out 
to the delegates that the fraterni­
ties had a selling problem to the 
public in convincing them that all 
the deferments given college stu­
dents were necessary.
Several editorials on this issue 
have appeared in the Georgia Tech 
Technique, the first being prompt­
ed by the drop in the all-fraternity 
scholastic average to 0.1 below the 
all men’s average, when the usual 
practice is for the fraternities to 
excel in this field.
Elimnate Hazing
After the second editorial men­
tioned, “That brothers fare no bet­
ter than the pledges during such 
affairs; and the high average ob­
tained by the sororities with their 
shorter, milder pledgeship evi­
dences the effect of these pro­
longed sessions,” it called for haz­
ing to be ruled out along with such 
activities as scavenger hunts, rides, 
detrimental public displays, padd­
ling, all night work details, and 
any other form of humiliation or 
physical abuse to which pledges 
might previously have been sub­
jected.
The Technique thought that the 
week should not only include a 
period of community service, but 
be compromised of numerous other 
activities involving fraternities as
a whole. Some of these could be 
meetings of fraternity and pledge 
leaders during which common 
problems may be discussed. The 
week could also be made more in­
teresting by competition between 
pledge classes, open houses for 
parents, and a combined dance to 
climax the period.
Also Give Blood 
Recently Tulane University an­
nounced a Greek week for thé 17 
social fraternities on the campus. 
It will feature group discussions 
for freshman of all fraternities, 
special dinners for fraternity pres­
idents, meetings of alumni and fac­
ulty advisers, and the appearance 
of a Red Cross Bloodmobile.
The IFC at Iowa State has 
adopted the Greek week with a 
slightly different twist. Instead of 
each fraternity having an individ­
ual project, all the pledge classes 
worked on one project.
ATO’s at CIT 
Our neighboring Greeks at W&J 
have just organized a “help week” 
with the aid of the Washington 
Chamber of Commerce. Each 
pledge is required to put in one 
day, working from 4 to 10 p.m. at 
his assigned task.
Greek week received its intro­
duction at Carnegie Tech by the 
ATO’s, who spent one Saturday 
afternoon last spring cleaning and 
painting a settlement house.
