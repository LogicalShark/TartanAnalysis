WEALTH AND WORTH.
So much has been said by news­
paper and magazine writers in re­
gard to the accumulation of wealth 
and its bearing upon our natural in­
tegrity, the Tartan believes that ex­
cerpts of the Washington’s Birthday 
address of Hon. W. U. Hensel at Le­
high University will be of value. He 
cited Washington as the richest cit­
izen of his day and referred to him 
as the exemplar of the “Moral Qual­
ity of Wealth.” The speaker de­
clared that it is the inherent ten­
dency of mankind throughout all na­
ture to acquire increase, retain and 
transmit material possessions, and he 
regretted the prevailing tendency to 
attack wealth as ill advised and tend­
ing to hamper the development of the 
country, adding:
“It is an age of business, of phys­
ical and material developments, of 
industrial energy and organization of 
mechanical achievement and scien­
tific discovery, but all these forces 
which have made the modern world 
so rich are of divine origin. Labor 
and genius applied to the soil and 
sea and sky have in every age pro­
duced wealth. Its acquisition thus 
has been the common experience. 
The protection of property has been 
the aspiration of every abiding na­
tion. The spirit of commerce, busi­
ness, trade, the organization of indus­
try and employment of labor, prompt­
ed by the hope of gain, and the desire 
to accumulate wealth, have tended to 
promote the higher life of man. In­
stead of deadening his spiritual and 
intellectual facilities, they accentu­
ate and stimulate them.
(Continued on page 7.)
GYMNASIUM.
The gymnasium idea has been tem­
porarily abandoned. While we can 
not give out this report as being offi­
cial, everything seems to support its 
truth. During a recent address the 
Director stated that the building of a 
gymnasium which could only be tem­
porary would entail an expense so 
great that it would not warrant it.
He said that from his own experi­
ence and the experience of men he 
had consulted, men of reputed force 
in the education of the physique, he 
was certain that what the students 
need most in this line is not a gym­
nasium but a spirit of love for exer­
cise. He believed if a man was re­
quired to give a certain amount of 
his time each day for work in the 
gymnasium it would be fatal to this 
element of love.
director Hamerschlag is making 
every endeavor to secure an en­
closed athletic field, and a man who 
can take charge of all athletics. Not 
necessarily a coach, but a man who 
can direct coaches; if we receive 
these two we will be satisfied until 
the permanent gym is ready. Won’t 
we?
---------o---------
It may be well to say at this point 
that articles on the same or similar 
subjects published in the Tartan are 
sometimes written by different mem­
bers of the staff and appear in dif­
ferent parts of the paper. This 
should impress the readers of the im­
portance of these articles.

A contributor to the Tartan has de­
clared that he will write no more, be­
cause some of the matter submitted 
by him fell under the “blue pencil”. 
Would like to suggest that the editor 
merely exercises his prerogative when 
he deems matter not quite up to the 
literary standard of the Tartan. Then 
it may happen once in a while that 
there may be too much one issue.
Full details of the 1911 class meet­
ing will be given in the next issue.
A suggestion to 1911. Get an in­
vestigation committee after Hess. He 
lias been away for several consecu­
tive nights. Perhaps when his book 
of Garden tickets is spent he will con­
sent to join us again.
Mackey Bros., of C 1, in an endeavor 
to illustrate how their name should be 
pronounced, put it on the black board 
in such a way that there was doubt 
as to whether they were advertising 
the song “Mali (ing) Eyes” or trying 
to spell “McEye.”
We are pleased to welcome Mr. S. 
S. Baker back in school.

Mr. Howard to C-l—“I’ll have to in­

Mr. Howard—“By substitution. If 
some of you were to substitute atten­
tion for childishness your simultane­
ous equations would not prove so dif- 
j flcult.”
Ow of C-l ex 1911, is ill with ty­
phoid. That he may soon recover is 
the earnest wish expressed by all his 
friends at Tech., -
Two things can’t occupy the same 
place at the same time. Well, how 
about four policemen on the same beat |

late in the park.

The Entertainment Committee has 
ail records broken for their “entertain­
ing” qualities; but these alone are 
not what the rest of the class desire. 
What we want is quantity.
The “innocence” of a Night “Prep.” 
was illustrated, a few evenings ago, by 
some of the glee club from 1910 tak­
ing advantage of him. They ordered 
a devilled crab for McCloy of 1912 and 
made him believe it was a fancy drink.
Since Baker has gone on his vaca­
tion the tri-weekly meetings of the
M------n club have not been held.
Here is a 'good chance for some bright 
young man from 1910 to show his 
“capacity” by being chosen as leader 
of the club in their recreations; and 
continue the meetings which were so 
thoroughly enjoyed by all who attend­
ed.
The way Pi’es. Skeehan called a 
meeting of class 1910, after the picture 
was taken, shows he is the man in the 
right place. He took advantage of the 
fact of there being a large number 
of the men assembled and put the busi­
ness of the class before them, with 
the result of a definite understanding 
of all just what is to be done. Skee­
han proved again to be a “Johnny on 
the spot.”
Reed, the “Clanny Scot”, is the rep­
resentative of 2 C on the parade com­
mittee. Stand out for the “kilts”, 
Reed.
The Mandolin Club have chosen Mr. 
Reed as their advisor. A good move 
boys and a square deal is assured -you, 
by your choice.
The banquet of the class will be held 
on Saturday night, March 1G. The 
tickets are put at $2.25 and can be had 
from any one of the committee. It 
is necessary that all who intend being 
present should signify their intentions 
at once.

NOTICE.
Last week an article appeared in 
one of the Pittsburg papers stating 
that a team of runners had been 
picked to represent Tech at the Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania Relay Carni­
val on April 27, 1907, giving the names 
of the men. Immediately men began 
to wonder when the team had been 
picked and ask why all were not given 
a chance. The captain of the track 
team wishes to state that the team 
has not been picked, and that he 
knows nothing of the above men­
tioned newspaper article. Now, fel­
lows, if you have a friend on a local 
newspaper staff, don’t give him un- 
authentic news about athletics. Un­
less you are a captain, a manager, a 
member of the management commit­
tee, or student press agent, please 
refrain from giving out information 
for publication, as it does more harm 
than good.

THE CONCERT.
On next Friday evening the Car­
negie Tech School’s Glee Club will 
perform for the benefit of school ath- 
letics in the new Machinery Hall. No 
doubt all have heard this announce­
ment before, but a good thing will 
bear repetition. It is to be hoped 
that most of the students will feel 
able to part with the necessary cash 
to enable them and at least one 
friend to attend. The department of 
athletics is sadly in need of funds and 
at present must rely on the student 
body for this form of support. So
come out in force and remember that 
every little helps.
---------o---------.
FOOT BALL.
The prospects of the foot-ball team 
for the coming season are very bright. 
With last season’s veterans, and with 
an entering class of about five hun­
dred men, the team should be a hun­
dred per cent, stronger than the one 
of last season.
In all probability Capt. Adams will 
call for a spring practice, something 
that is very much needed and ought 
to be of great benefit to the foot-ball 
men. In addition to this the men will 
be asked to report for practice by the 
first of September, as the season 
opens about ten days after the open­
ing of school.
The management is working hard 
on the schedule, and can assure the 
candidates that they will have to work 
hard to make the team. At present 
it is impossible to announce the 
complete schedule, but correspond­
ence with the following schools is 
going on: Lehigh, Case, W. & J., W. 
U. P., Geneva, State, Ohio State, 
Western Reserves and Southwestern 
Normal.
Nothing can be said about a coach, 
but with the co-operation of the en­
tire student body and with a dona­
tion ^'om it, it will be possible for 
us to secure one.
In conclusion, the management 
earnestly begs that the student body 
refrain from knocking. If you can’t 
“boast” don’t knock.
Respectfully,
Meldrim Thomson, Mgr.

COMMENTS.
The article published last week in the 
Tartan concerning a Handbook for 
Engineers by Prof. Trinks, has been 
read by almost every one in the 
schools, and has been declared a good 
thing by everyone. Mr. Mamatev 
says that the Junior Mechanicals 
could write several instructive pages 
for the Hand-book on “The art of loaf­
ing in the modern machine shop, 
with exhaustive tables and data de­
rived from actual experiment.”
It is understood that the Junior 
Electricals have decided to abandon 
the Electrical Society as a Technical 
organization, but that it is to be con­
tinued as a social club. That is what 
comes of having so many “good look­
ers” in a class. No one expects the 
Mechanicals or the Civils to follow 
suit.

This society held its regular monthly 
meeting last Thursday evening at the 
home of John Provost, at Castle 
Shannon. Among other business 
matters attended to, it was decided 
unanimously that the society tender 
a reception some time during the 
coming spring, to those first year 
students who are going to take up 
Civil Engineering next year. Dr. 
Thayer favored the students with one 
of his characteristically interesting 
talks on “Doing Time in the Rhode 
Island State Prison.” Dr. Thayer was 
commissioned a few years ago to lo­
cate all the underground pipe lines 
of the institution. As it was neces­
sary that he have free access to all 
parts of the buildings and grounds, he 
could not help but observe the con­
ditions under which the convicts live. 
Judging from Dr. Thayer’s remarks, 
the existence of the man in the 
striped uniform is anything but. a 
desirable one.
John Coursin, the society’s ex-pres­
ident, was the next man on the pro­
gram, and he had the members in an 
uproar by telling of some of his past 
experiences while making a certain 
preliminary survey.
The society has been tendered many 
a dainty repast during the past few 
months, but none that excelled the 
hospitable table to which we were 
next shown. With the table most 
tastily decorated with “Tech” pen­
nants,—the refreshments served by

WEALTH AND WORTH.
(Continued from page 1.)
The rich of the country, as a class, 
and its wealth, as a rule, have been 
faithful in every time of peril; the 
wealth of the world to-day stands for 
universal law, order, peace and jus­
tice, and against misrule, revolution, 
war and oppression.”
Mr. Hensel recited the names of 
the leading men of the Colonial period, 
all of whom gave of their wealth and 
services in the cause of freedom, and 
then said:
“In no age of the world and in no 
country on the map has wealth given 
more generous recognition to in­
tellectual genius, moral elevation, 
spiritual necessities and aesthetic 
culture. The rich are getting richer; 
likewise, and more so, the poor. There 
never was a time in the history of 
the world, of any other country, when 
and where the,moral and matrial con­
dition of the poor was as tolerable 
as in America at the outset of the 
twentieth century; nor when a day’s 
unskilled labor so easily supplied all 
the necessities of life and commanded 
so many of its luxuries.”
Referring to the charge that wealth 
bred trusts and monopolies, Mr. Hen­
sel said that it was but another form 
of the old cry against labor-saving 
machinery, adding: —
“Association of corporations to a 
common end and combinations of 
wealth to a single purpose are not 
per se immoral, unconstitutional or 
hurtful to the general welfare. Since 
these combinations peculiarly Amer­
ican, have been effected, American 
trade and business have taken a place 
in the commerce of nations never be­
fore known. With increased demand 
for industrial efficiency and cheap­
ened production—the magnitude of 
modern undertakings and the neces­
sity upon men of great fortunes to 
give stability to their interests—com­
binations of corporations have now 
come just, as naturally and as inevi­
tably as partnership and joint stock 
associations superseded individual en­
terprise, and were succeeded, in turn, 
by corporations.”
The accumulation of wealth has al­
ways been and must always be fol­
lowed by its distribution—and the 
processes are alike healthful to the 
commonwealth.
“Is Philadelphia any poorer or any 
worse because the prophetic eye of 
its ‘Merchant Mariner,’ Stephen Gi­
rard, nigh a century ago, foresaw the 
wealth of anthracite land holdings 
and of central city real estate, and as 
a consequence, fifteen hundred or­
phan and homeless boys are being 
constantly nurtured to useful man­
hood by his perennial beneficence.
“Is Pennsylvania any poorer or any 
worse because the skillful and eco­
nomical manipulation of a great nat­
ural resource laid the foundations of 
a fortune which has enabled Mr. 
Rockefeller to endow the cause of 
liberal education with a gift such as 
the world never before saw, and be­
fore the splendor of which all feats 
of destructive arms on land or sea, 
must pale and slink abashed?
“Is Pittsburg the busiest workshop 
of all the busy world, poorer because 
above its pillar of cloud arise and 
shine the sunlit peaks of that twin 
school of the arts and sciences, en­
dowed by the munificent bounty of 
Andrew Carnegie, to teach a mate­
rial age forever and forever the les­
son of ‘beauty made the bride of 
use?’ ”
A few nights ago “Bob” Parsons 
was leaving the schools via the stu­
dents’ entrance when he observed 
Prof. Mac Lucas coming down the 
steps. It seems Bobby had heard he 
was chalked up for a “Zip” in English, 
so he thought he would make an ap­
peal to the head of that department 
and see if the sentence could not be 
fightened somewhat. When he had 
finished his plea, Prof. Mac Lucas po­
litely handed down his decision in the 
case. Just what that decision was 
you can guess from the words of 
Jack Flaherty, the janitor (an inter­
ested listener), who began to sing,— 
“Thirty days! thirty days!
That’s what the judge has said.”

EDITING A NEWSPAPER.
Editing a newspaper is a nice thing. 
If we publish jokes, people say we 
are rattle-brained. If we don’t, we 
are fossils. If we publish original 
matter, they say we don’t give them 
enough selections. If we give them 
selections, they say we are too lazy 
to write. If we criticise, we are quot­
ing from an article. If we don’t go 
to church, we are heathens. If we 
do go, we are hypocrites. If we re­
main at the office, we ought to be 
out looking for news items. If we go 
out, then we are not attending to 
business. If we wear old clothes, 
they laugh at us. If we wear good 
clothes, they say we have a pull. 
Now, what are we to do? Just as 
likely as not some one will say that 
I stole this from an exchange. So I 
did.

M. M. C. S.
It will keep some “Brothers” hust­
ling to get oft to the new buildinng of 
the M. M. C. S. after class.
The M. M. C. ¡S. girls are looking 
forward to the time when they will 
have the privileges of a gym.
Heard in the millinery room. (Night 
session.)
Miss—“Did you put those pins in 
that frame ?”
Another Miss—“Yes, don’t they look 
millineryfied?”
“Aren’t we going to have a crown 
in this hat? If not, surely the top­
knot will he bleached.”
“Are we going to make straw 
braids?” asked one girl. Why, she 
must be dreaming!
It certainly was most grotesque
The way she would litter her desque 
Yet she plainly showed pique
If one ventured to spique 
And tell her ’twas not picturesque.
(Come into the Bookkeeping Depart­
ment for explanation of the above.)
It was a great piece of misfortune 
that the faculty had its pictures taken 
at lunch hour. Up in the kitchen each 
girl was serving herself and went on 
the principle of “First come, first 
served”. Such a scramble . as there 
was, and when everyone was served 
there wasn’t even a scrap left for the 
poor faculty. It would be too lad to 
relate what the chef said but there is 
one thing certain he will never leave 
his veal and potatoes to the tender 
mercies of the girls again.
It will be rather lonely after the 
“annual” comes out and the young 
men bent on business cease to bring 
the M. M. C. S. out of its peaceful 
repose. We noticed one young man 
with a rosy blush on his cheek, the 
center of an admiring crowd, yester­
day. For all his blushing he seemed j 
to be enjoying it as much as anyone j 
and of course no one blames him.
Geometry is a puzzle 
To tax the feminine mind 
Maddening, baffling, blinding,
A hideous terrible grind.
And why, oh why, we question, 
Should we be tortured so,
What difference can it really make 
How lines and angles go?
It wron’t make lace and flounces 
More easy to acquire,
Nor bring one inch the nearer 
The hats that we desire.
Nor prove that straight hair’s curly, 
Nor make our angles curves,
So banish it, we pray thee.
It’s all that it deserves.
We are all very glad to welcome 
back our two friends, Miss Nancy 
Herron and Miss Alma Orth after 
their long vacation. You are just back 
in time to help us move, girls.
Miss Stutz—Miss Gibbs, why are 
you late this morning?
Miss Gibbs—We had griddle cakes 
for breakfast.

SIGN PAINTING.
We are going to try and get Miller 
of the sign painting department to 
lead the band on Founders Day. He 
is an artist with a baton.
How many does that make, Miller?
Wonder why Frivogel did not stay 
with the boys on Wednesday night?
White looks down hearted nowa­
days. Can’t we find something to 
cheer him.
They tell us “Fri” is a great dancer 
and also a favorite with the gentler 
sex.

This story is told of a college pro­
fessor who was noted for his concen­
tration of mind. The professor was 
returning home one night from a sci­
entific meeting, still thinking of the 
subject discussed there. He had 
reached his room in safety, when he 
heard a noise which seemed to come 
from under the bed.
“Is there some one there?” he 
asked.
“No, professor,” answered the in­
truder, who knew of the professor’s 
peculiarities.
“That’s strange,” pondered the 
learned man, “I was positive someone 
was under my bed.”
