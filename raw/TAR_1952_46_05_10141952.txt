Students Await Homecoming Days
Traditions Test 
Approaching
All Freshmen To Be 
In Porter Hall Saturday
Saturday of this week, October
18, is Freshman day, a gala occa­
sion marking the end of the fresh­
man’s six-week ordeal of dink- 
wearing. An innovation this year, 
it has been designed to give more 
significance to the end of tht 
dreaded traditions program which 
previously was sort of lost in the 
shuffle at Homecoming. On this 
day the traditions test will be 
given, the freshman-sophomore 
competition with the queen can­
didates presiding will be played, 
and the freshman can bury their 
dinks — if they win.
The traditions test, which will 
be given at 1:30 p.m. in Porter 
¦Hall is compulsory for all fresh­
men. The test will cover various 
phases of campus activity—all in­
formation asked for concerns 
things which the freshmen need 
to know before they have been 
here very long or things which 
they are likely to run across in the 
normal course of events.
Following the test at 2:30 p.m. 
is the famed freshman-sophomore 
competition, an intensely fought 
battle of strength. The game is 
p\*yed a good deal as football ex­
cept- that the ball is six feet in 
diameter. The sophomores (last 
year’s freshmen) are undefeated, 
untied, and unscored-upon—al­
most. The freshmen have never 
been beaten since time immemor­
ial— almost. The challenge is 
great. The odds are even as we go 
to press.
Presiding over the game will 
be nine lovely ladies—the queen 
candidates.
Finally, should the freshmen 
win, a great funeral for freshman 
regulations will be held, for at that 
hour regulations end. But—should 
the sophomores win, a great fun­
eral will be held for the freshmen, 
for they must continue with the 
burden of wearing their dinks, 
Siametags, et al.
Citcom Clan Plans 
Hayride Sunday, 
Dance October 24
Everyone is invited to a free 
dance sponsored by Citcom clan 
the Friday night of Homecoming. 
The place is Thistle hall and the 
music will be supplied by numer­
ous name bands who have con­
sented to donate their services. 
The dance will follow the pep 
tally also sponsored by Citcom. 
Casual clothing will be in order. 
Cokes and pretzels will be served 
in the Black Cat lounge.
Citcom will open its 1952 pro­
gram Sunday, October 18, when 
the clan will sponsor a hayride 
for the commuting students. Any­
one interested in the hayride is 
urged to sign the list posted out­
side Skibo.
Also ih the way of fun the 
clan will sponsor a Halloween 
swim party October 31 in the 
school pool. All swimming suits 
must be in the form of a costume. 
Traditional Halloween refresh­
ments will be served.
Queen Rules Dance;

Nine freshmen women will soon begin active campaigning for 
the title of Homecoming queen. This position of honor includes 
official opening of Homecoming at the coronation ceremony at the 
Carnegie day exercises on Friday, October 24. The queen and her

Homecoming Theme 
Highlights the Plaid
Every year the planners of Homecoming highlight alumni and 
reunions, but this year students as well as alumni will honor the 
plaid. Andrew Carnegie, from whom Carnegie Institute of Technology 
obtains its name and its Scottish traditions, actually didn’t have his 
own tartan or plaid by birth. Born4---------------------------------------------------------
into a humble family, Carnegie 
didn’t belong to a clan which 
would 'automatically provide a 
plaid. Therefore, he adopted the 
plaid of the Cameron clan.
Varied Uses 
The plaid we will honor this 
Homecoming weekend will pri­
marily be the Cameron tartan 
with which freshmen and upper- 
men are acquainted. Freshmen
were first introduced to it when 
they purchased their grey dinks 
with a plaid peak. The Cameron 
plaid is also popularly used for 
ties, jackets, and skirts by Tech 
students. The same plaid is used 
by Kiltie band for uniforms, how­
ever some of the bagpipes are 
made from tartans of other clans. 
The Cameron plaid is distinguish­
ed by wide dark green and blue

Mrs, Ely Honored, 
Appointed Head 
Secretarial Dept.
A change in administration in 
the department of secretarial 
studies of Margaret Morrison Car­
negie College became effective 
September of this year. Mrs. Ely, 
formerly a professor in the de­
partment, was appointed head of 
the department on July 1, after 
having served as assistant head 
from September 1950 until this 
year. The post was held by Mrs. 
Alexander, now Dean of Mar­
garet Morrison, until Mrs. Ely’s 
appointment. Mrs. Ely, a Smith 
college graduate, came to Tech in 
September 1926, and is well 
known on campus for her active 
interest in many student and fac­
ulty organizations.

FPHA Firetrap Not Included 
In Alumni’s Tour Of Campus
By Fred Sonnenberg
While crowds of returning alumni are being shown through the 
new ivory palace home of the Industrial Administration school, sev­
eral employees of the school will probably be stationed to detour 
guests from ‘the pride of the men’s dormitories’, the FPHA barracks.
Hidden amongst the shambled ?---------------------------------------------------------
faculty houses and the school’s 
dump, this cornboard shack stands 
as a monument to the days when 
Carnegie Tech was crawling with 
veterans and dormitory space was 
at a premium. Built by the gov­
ernment in 1946 to house some of 
the GI’s, it was supposed to be 
reduced to dust in five years. How­
ever, three score and 13 months
have passed and one-half still 
stands.
Characteristic Smell
To the casual observer this rat- 
infested dump no more represents 
a dormitory than the IA building 
does a school house. Upon entering 
he is struck in the face by the

Opening Play 
French Drama
Friday, October 24, will be the 
opening night for the drama de­
partment’s first production of the 
year. “Ring Round the Moon,” a 
comedy written by a French play­
wright, was adapted by Chris­
topher Fry. The opening of the 
play will be attended by alumni 
returning to celebrate Homecom­
ing.
The plot takes place between 
1911 and 1914. It is the story of 
twin brothers, one shy and retir­
ing, the other self-confident and 
aggressive, and the two girls they 
meet. Also in the play is an aunt 
who, as the “power behind the 
throne,” tries to run their lives 
for them.
John Ragin and Bob Dunn alter­
nate in playing the leading double 
role of the twin brothers. Peggy 
Maurer and Lucia French will 
take the parts of the two girls. 
Isabel and Diane, respectively. 
Joan Norton-Taylor and Carol 
Jenkins alternate in the part of 
the aunt. Mr. Henry Boettcher is 
the director and Mr. Frank Bol­
linger is stage manager.
Tickets will be distributed or 
Tuesday, October 21, from 4 p.m. 
to 5 p.m. in room 100 in the Fine 
Arts building. The play will run 
from October 24 to November 3 
with a matinee on October 31.

Gridiron Spectators Interest 
Alchemist More Than Game
By John J. John, as told to Dick Durstine
In my sincere desire to obtain a well rounded education from my 
life as a college student, I ventured once again, last Saturday, into 
the world outside the department of alchemy, this time to attend an 
athletic contest at that place called Forbes field.
This was truly a remarkable ex-#----------------------------------------------------------
perience, and far more interesting 
than I had been led to believe it 
would be. I took little interest in 
the performance within the arena, 
where 22 young ruffians seemed 
intent on transforming themselves 
into 21 or less young ruffians; but 
the side events proved most enjoy­
able.
Forbidding Structure
On leaving the sombre confines 
of McBoss hall, I took with me my 
little brother Guglielmo, for I am 
determined that his education 
should not be neglected. We walk­
ed together across the marshes 
and bogs that form the campus, 
past the majestic structures that 
make up Carnegie Tech, and 
hence, after asking directions of 
a nearby shepherd, found our way 
to Forbes field.
Our destination is a large bor- 
bidding structure in the Oakland 
district, devoted to the display of 
sports events and evangelistic 
speakers. It surrounds a plot of 
grass Cor fibrous mud, if you pre­
fer), on which these events take 
place.
Make Pilgrimage
Those wishing further informa­
tion as to the physical appearance 
of the structure should consult the 
reference section of the Carnegie 
library or make a pilgrimage to 
the field itself. The latter is advis­
ed for those who have the patience 
and daring to make their way 
through the University of Pitts­
burgh’s (I can think of no less 
odious name for it) parking lot.
Getting back to our story, little 
Guglielmo and I presented our stu­
dent identification cards at the 
gate, accepted a free program from 
the trained banshee stationed at 
the door, and proceeded to our 
seats.
Famous Band
Being a fraternity pledge, my 
brother had the privilege of sitting 
in a reserved section on the 50 
yard line. I, however, was forced 
to sit elsewhere, not belonging to 
any politically powerful organiza­
tion which arranges seating for 
its members.
Soon the Kiltie band (often re­
ferred to as the world famous Kil-
Draft Test
All male students who are 
registered with selective service 
and who have not taken one of 
the tests given previously, are 
urged to apply immediately for 
permission to take the selective 
service qualification test. Appli­
cation forms are available at 
any local board. Tests will be 
given on December 4, 1952, and 
April 23, 1953; but regardless of 
the date selected it is advisable 
to file an application at once. 
All students enrolled in ROTC 
are advised to take the test, even 
though they may be currently 
classified in class 1-D.
tie band) entered, entertained us 
with a few numbers, and pro­
ceeded to its section of seats. The 
crowd now waited in tense antici­
pation.
Outdoor Ballet
Following this a host of persons 
in outlandish suits paraded onto 
the field, went through assorted 
motions, called “warming up” by 
those who keep up with these 
things, and proceeded to benches 
on the opposite side of the field. 
Thus far, the afternoon had the 
characteristics of an outdoor bal­
let.
However, as the game itself 
started, things began to happen. 
Those in the fraternity section 
honored Bacchus freely and con­
tinually. Assorted others devot­
ed their time to designing and 
building paper airplanes which 
they hurled onto the field.
Mute Wake 
Besides the players on the 
grounds were several other per­
sons, dressed in bright garb, whose 
function seems to be to incite emo­
tion in the members of the audi­
ence. Evidently they do not realize 
that this is impossible at such a 
staid and dignified institution as 
Carnegie Institute of Technology.
When these persons prepare to 
present their performance, sup­
posedly to be supported by the 
spectators, a deathly pall falls over 
the arena. It is as if a number of 
deaf mutes were attending a wake. 
Even Bacchus takes second place 
in this dismal silence.
Endless Circle 
Occasionally, however, some 
noise is coaxed from the throats 
of these onlookers. When one of 
the young ruffians on the field suc­
ceeds in escaping all the other 
young ruffians (called gridders, 
footballers, or pigskin artists, de­
pending on what sports pages you 
read), the crowd goes wild, seeing 
something important in this.
It all seems rather silly and 
pointless, however, for as soon as 
this happens, the ball is taken to 
the center of the field and the pro­
cedure starts over again. If they 
were permitted to go home after 
crossing the goal once I could see 
a reason for being so anxious to 
do so. But under the circum­
stances, it is nothing but a vicious 
and endless circle.
Poor Pigs 
By the time all is done, every­
one seems to have had a fully en­
joyable time, and proceed on 
their merry way home, leaving be­
hind torn programs and other bits 
of rubbish.
It may be good entertainment, 
but certainly the whole thing 
seems like much ado about noth­
ing. If the pigs who produce those 
footballs would form a union, and 
refuse to sell their bodies any 
more, there would be no footballs, 
hence no football games. Things 
might be simpler that way.

New Improvement 
F or* More wood
This year the Dorm Council of 
Morewood Gardens is promoting a 
number of changes. In fact, one 
senior expresses the opinion that 
the Council has accomplished more 
in three weeks than in any previ­
ous year. The organization used 
to be solely a disciplinary body, 
but now it has initiated many new 
projects.
Already, action has been taken 
abolishing the black robes which 
were the former uniform. Only 
freshman girls must sign to go 
from tower to tower after 7:30 
p.m. A candy machine has been 
installed in the basement along 
with new washers and Council 
members alsd’ painted the chairs 
in the laundry room.
A coin machine has been order­
ed for the main desk to provide 
the girls with change. Coffee and 
soft drink machines are also 
promised in the near future. Ten­
tative plans for a juke box in the 
dining room of Morewood Gar­
dens are also under consideration.
Chris Xenakis is the president 
of this organization; the vice-pres­
ident is Suzanne Straight and sec­
retary treasurer-is Nancy Beck. 
Other members include: Joanne 
Carmen, Martha Brackemeyer, 
Virginia Somerville, Lynn Bene­
dict, Freda Greenberg, Mary Lou 
Maurhoff, and Janet Wilkens.
Candidates
Any freshman class officer 
candidate wishing to use the fa­
cilities of radio station WRCT 
for campaigning is requested to 
contact Don Hand at SC 1-9580 
as quickly as possible.
Those interested in making 
Skibo campaign speeches on 
Tuesday, October 21, during the 
lunch hours is requested to con­

A MAN’S JOB? . . . There are 
approximately ten girls enrolled in

Science this semester. Well, we 
sure did need them during the last

you’re here.
DANCING IN DISGUISE . . . 
Morewood Gardens was quite the 
place Saturday night because of 
frat costume parties. Within the 
gathering we noted: a French poo­
dle, the top of a Kiltie band uni­
form with a sheet for the bottom, 
little children with short dresses 
and trousers carrying all-year 
suckers, and to top it off various 
forms of apache dress complete 
with berets and split skirts.
WALKING OUR WAY . . . One 
dreary Monday we counted the 
steps one travels across the cut to 
class. From the bottom step enter­
ing the cut to the fork leading to 
Fine Arts and Engineering build­
ing is—348 steps! This traveled 
four times a day plus the addition­
al steps to the buildings and 
through the halls is a minimum of 
1392 steps. Well, at least we can 
all graduate with a B.S.—bachelor 
of steps.

Fire Protection Is Insufficient

of a locker room odor and the 
stink of aging cornboard). The dis­
mal corridors offer no atmosphere, 
and it’s hard to see how anyone 
can feel at home.
The rooms resemble the cells of 
14th century monks, complete with 
the standard issue of one useless 
study lamp, chair, desk (a glori­
fied table), wiggly bed, and a 
dresser that must have been 
picked up at the mission. In the
in the way of a lounge, just two or 
three junky couches and another 
room containing two water-soak­
ed ping-pong tables on an ash cov­
ered floor.
Although more convenient than 
living off campus, the barracks are 
still a disgrace to the school, and 
show a lack of planning when they 
have to remain standing so long.
Each fellow gets a sore spot in 
his stomach when he compares his 
j home for nine months to the pal- 
winter the temperature varies ace given the girls. When will
from 50-90 degrees, and the poor 
fellow in a first floor room is 
subject to the whims of the second 
floor resident who controls the 
radiator valve.
Monsoon Season 
The shower rooms are identical 
to India in the monsoon season— 
bugs underfoot and no control 
over the water. Even the thin 
walls are a source of endless 
humor. Once a fellow was chasing 
a field mouse around his room, 
when the poor animal took off 
through the wall.
A far more serious point, the 
fire prevention and protection is 
lousy. One wooden ladder (some­
times with broken rungs) hangs 
from the second floor, and some 
residents would have to run 35 
yaids down a five foot wide hall- 
day which couldn’t last four min­
utes in a fire. The fire alarm sys­
tem is considered a toy by some 
students, and sometimes goes off 
in the middle of the night as a 
practical joke.

Plaid’s The Theme
The symbolic interpretation of 
the plaid can be adapted in any 
way. The planners of Homecoming 
weekend, however, think of the 
varied colors as representing the 
varied activities on campus. We 
parallel the intricate weaving of 
the colors, which produces the col­

ties which makes Carnegie Tech

Cameron Choir 
Presenting Varied 
Student Programs
The Cameron choir, reduced to 
touring size, has ambitious plans 
for this year. Of the more than one 
hundred students who tried out, 
62 made the final roster, forming 
a group high in ability and inter­
est. Tentative plans for a week- 
long tour later in the year have 
been made to take advantage of 
these attributes.
As before, the choir will sing at 
Homecoming, Spring Carnival, and 
Tuesday chapel. An addition this 
year will be a program with Dr. 
Marshall Bidwell’s series in Car­
negie hall and a possible joint con­
cert with the Dartmouth men’s 
glee club. This year will be cli­
maxed by a formal spring con­
cert at Carnegie hall.
Directing the choir this year, as 
he has done in the past, will be 
Mr. Richard L. Camp, a graduate 
in instrumental music of Bethany 
college. There he was assistant 
director of the men’s glee club and 
has been active In local church

Letters—
iere s i our
Editor, the Tartan:
Although we were all sorry to lose Mr. Wil- 
lirm Schaeffer as the Kiltie band director, we are 
ail glad to welcome Mr. Robert Cantrick to the 
Tech campus. However I have noticed at the past 
two football games that Mr. Cantrick does not 
wear kilts. Part of the pageantry that we all love 
about the Kiltie band is the wearing of kilts, so 
why doesn’t its director wear them?
It seems to me that Student Council, or whoever 
¦would appropriate the money to buy them, ought 
to uo so without delay; that is if Mr. Cantrick does 
not already have kilts. If he does, however, pos­
sess them I most heartily urge him to wear them 
to the remaining games. This would make the 
band look more uniform and it would satisfy the 
student body.
Sincerely yours, 
i . Sheila Sullivan.
Too Long Feature
Editor, the Tartan:
With your permission I would like to make 
one observation concerning last week’s Tartan, and 
particularly the John J. John feature. It is cer­
tainly not the Tartan’s responsibility to promote 
the efforts of student groups or to raise the intel­
lectual and moral level of extra-curricular activity, 
but when space which could have been allotted 
to publicize deserving discussion groups is used to 
ridicule a popular religious movement, I call this 
capitalizing on the popular mood and a definite 
disservice to the student body.
Let me emphasize that in my opinion the tales 
©f John J. John are entertaining and worthwhile, 
because they show a keen insight of student feel­
ing; however, serious and important copy should 
not, I feel, be sacrificed on the altar of popular 
demand.
(An article of 200 words on the educational 
program of the Newman club which was in the 
Tartan office last Friday was cut to twenty words 
while the John J. John satire cm chapel ran nearly 
two full columns.)
Respectfully,
Robert J. Lechner.
(EDITOR'S NOTE: While the John story may 
have been too long in some people’s eyes, we Jiave 
received no complaint except the above. Our feel­
ing was, when faced with more copy than space, 
that John had a more overall appeal than a New- 
vian club schedule for its 50 members. Maybe 20 
words was too little, but it’s more than other non 
all-school activities are given.)

Inert Dorm Council
As has been pointed out elsewhere in this issue, Carnegie 
Tech is in dire need of more and better men’s dormitory 
facilities. During our span of four years, many of the dorm 
residents have been constantly asking someone to carry their 
complaints to the proper party, but evidence shows that 
nothing has been done. A quick glance through the White 
Book or the Student Handbook shows that there is an or­
ganization on the campus designed to be the representative 
body of the men in the dormitories known as Men’s Council. 
During the past few years the Council has lost sight of its 
objectives (or at least the objectives that would be most 
beneficial to the men in the dorms) and has become semi­
absorbed in minor points that concern a few in the dormi­
tories and its huge treasury.
The relative merits of this spending program have been 
argued by many for the last few years, but neglecting all this, 
for this is not the function of any representative council, we 
still can find fault with the present Men’s Dorm Council. It is 
not serving as the intermediary between the dorm men and the 
Administration. No single man can ever be heard by his su­
periors when the go-between remains silent on all the issues. 
For reasons, appearing on the surface to be only laziness and 
lack of diplomacy, the governing men of the dorms have passed 
off each of the member’s complaints as not worthy of discussion. 
This conflict has become so serious that several of the more active 
men living in the dormitories have had to seek other mediums to 
satisfy their wishes. During this time the Council has always had 
time to consider the purchase of movies, television sets, and 
photographic equipment.
When prodded for the reasons behind this lack of rep­
resentation, the Councilmen said it was impossible to func­
tion as they should because no interest could be stirred up 
among the dormitory residents. It’s the^same old story with 
most of the activities on campus which overlook their 
responsibility to instill this interest in their members. No 
long winded promises or proposed improvements are going 
to receive much support if year after year these annual plans 
are dropped. Much of this trouble stems from the common 
campus policy of leaving all the important positions for the 
seniors, who have lost a lot of drive after four years under 
the old system. When there is considerable initiative among | 
the lower classmen, there is no reason why unwilling or busy ! 
seniors have to be railroaded into office.
The ruckus about the FPHA has been kicked around for 
many years by those who have lived under that roof. Long ago 
Dorm Council should have seen the chance to do its members 
some good by pressing the school for a definite answer, or at 
least felt its duties. Several of the school’s brass have thought 
all was well in the barracks except for the appearance. Many 
mouths dropped when tales of rats, dirt, and untamed air 
currents were aired in Administration hall.
If the Dorm Council had been ‘on the ball’ each one of 
these facts would have been hammered home to thosie in high 
places. The body representing all the male dorm students 
should be able to carry a little weight, but instead it has 
chosen to remain in the background and watch movies and 
television, caring little if some are living in such poor con­
ditions that they have considered leaving the school. I
Inquiring Reporter—
Reporter Corners 
Frosh Candidates
By Ken Winston
This week’s question asked by the inquiring re­
porter was as follows: Explain briefly why you 
are running for president of tbe freshman class 
and what you feel you can accomplish if you are 
elected.
Louis Teti, freshman, mechanical engineering-—
“If you choose to elect me presi­
dent of the freshman class, I will 
not be the kind of president that 
does not have any further con­
cern with those who elected him 
to that office. I intend to run 
on a platform which not only 
promises that I will do my best, 
but which tells you exactly what 
I intend to do for the freshman 
class.
“One of the major planks of 
my platform is to lift the school spirit of Carnegie 
Tech which is, as I see it, in sad need of over­
hauling. This I will do by promoting bigger and 
better pep rallies, much more recognition of all 
our athletic teams, and more active participation 
in all our activities. I think that our freshman 
class has the spirit, to. develop a pride for Carnegie
unequaled in any school in the United States,
“Another one of my planks is to promote a 
freshman sponsored dance at which we would have 
a nationally famous orchestra. This event could be 
built up into one of the largest affairs of the year.
“This is one other major plank in my platform, 
and this I say from the heart. If you choose to 
elect me as your president, I will do everything 
within my power, with your cooperation, to make 
this freshman class, our class, the best in Carnegie 
Tech’s history.”
Walter J. Ender, freshman painting and design— 
“My desire to be president of
the freshman class is prompted
by a great feeling of pride in
belonging to a progressively 
active group of students. That 
I may work with you, play with 
you, and talk to all of you stu­
dents who are studying and 
evaluating the “Carnegie Plan" 
for future adaption in the world 
of opportunity. Being a new ar­
rival to Carnegie Tech, I see no 
world-shaking problems to solve. If a problem 
or needed improvement should arise, I will show 
willingness to help you solve these problems as 
your next class president.”
Tom Wright, freshman printing management—
“Class organization is the basis 
of the platform upon which I 
will run for president of the 
class of ’56.
“In my first six week here I 
have come to realize that there
is no organization of the fresh­
man class. Of course, I realize 
that at first everything is new 
to the freshmen, but if we want
to be recognized as a class we
must stand together.
“This can be done by Treating and promoting 
class and school activities, setting up a suggestion 
box through which each freshman will have a 
voice in the functions of his class, promote Fresh­
man participation in intramural sports, etc. My
object is to carry out these proposed plans, through 
which I feel the Freshman can have a voice on 
cajnpus.
“This platform also expresses the ideas of those
who are running on a ticket with me. They are:
Jerry Roy, vice-president E&S; Roger Earlson, 
vice-president' FA; Roy Parsich, treasurer; Lin 
Smith, secretary; Jack Recker. promotions chair­
man.
Will Stevenson, freshman metallurgy—“I have 
numerous reasons for wanting to 
!;e the president of our freshman 
class. As all people need a good 
leader, I feel that we, the fresh­
man, should pick someone who 
v/ill make our class the best, I 
would like *o be the one to guide 
us in our conquests, not only in 
school but on campus as well. 
^ 11 of us, being greenhorns, need 
someone ter protect us from the 
rrath of the upperclassmen.
• i plan a ie-.v changes on the campus, namely, 
to have the dinks altered and have all freshmen 
treated as equals with upperclassmen. I woul:1 like 
to have something designated as belonging ' • he 
freshman class like the Senior Fence and Walk.’*

Skibos Wallop Johns Hopkins, 40-6
Bluejay Offense Crumbles 
Against Solid Tech Line
Tartans Outdo Visitors In Every Department 
Alert Defense Ruins Pass Attack With 6 Interceptions
Scoring 20 points in the fourth quarter, the Carnegie Tech Tar-4 
tans romped over the Bluejays from Johns Hopkins 40-6. In gain­
ing their second straight victory of the season against one loss, the 
plaid showed defensive alertness and strength by intercepting 5 
Blue and Black passes, recover-?
ing 5 fumbles, blocking an at­
tempted conversion and holding 
their opponents to 28 yards rush­
ing.
On the line John Williamson, 
Jim Vodenichar, and Frank 
Wengrzyn were standouts while 
Ed Miller, Chuck Griffiths, Ed 
Karcher and Roy DeVries shone in 
the defensive backfield. For John 
Hopkins Ed McNicholas and Wen­
dell Smith played superbly both 
on offense and defense with 
George Klemmick and Angelo 
Fortunato carrying the brunt of 
the ground attack.
Half Ends 13-6
The Scots broke into the scor­
ing column early when a Miller 
to Ed Ziegenfuss aerial clicked 
for 23 yards and a Tartan TD with 
Gil Dissen converting. In the sec­
ond quarter both teams tallied as 
Griffiths hit pay dirt for Tech 
and Klemmick for the Bluejays 
with neither conversion attempt 
being successful. At the end of the 
half the score stood 13-6 for the 
Skibos.
“Firin Byron’’ Eisaman’s 4 yard 
plunge was the only score in a 
hard fought third quarter but in 
the fourth the Scots broke loose 
with their .biggest quarter this 
year, racking up 20 points on 
TD’s by Dissen, Irv Schecter, and 
Tom Warner while Dissen and 
Carricato each added an extra 
point.
Schecter Romps
After Dissen’s opening kick-off 
the Plaid forced the Bluejays to 
punt. Starting on the opposition 35, 
the Clan backfield moved the ball 
to the 23 from where Miller hit 
Ziegenfuss for 6 points. A few 
minutes later Dick Major recov­
ered an oppostion fumble but 
Tech couldn’t roll and an exchange 
of kicks followed. The Blue and 
Black pushed to the Carnegie 
twelve after grabbing a Miller 
pass but the Plaid stone wall 
could not be penetrated. Tech then 
fumbled but Karcher fell on a 
Klemmick bobble to regain pos­
session and Schecter unravelled 
the day’s longest run as he dug 
for 74 yards and a sure TD. How­
ever he was called out of bounds 
on the Bluejay 25, where the Tar­
tan attack stalled.
In the second quarter Miller 
snatched a Blue and Black pass on 
the Johns Hopkins 21, each side 
fumbled, Schecter went for 20 on 
¿"""reverse and three plays later 
Griffiths ploughed over to make 
the score 1
the half, the boys from Baltimore 
pushed 71 yards downfield with 
Klemmick going into pay dirt for 
the first and only opposition tally. 
The big gainer in the drive was 
an aerial from Myers to McNich­
olas who had only DeVries to beat 
but the opposing end couldn’t get 
around him.
Many Interceptions
Shortly after the start of the 
last half Griffiths intercepted a 
Myer’s pass and Tech took over on 
the visitors 44. Craig punted to 
the 14 where the Plaid grabbed a 
loose ball on the 4. Eisaman rang 
the total up to 19-6 and Dissen I 
followed with the extra point.
After two more interceptions by j 
Tech, a series of jump-passes to 
Craig and Pakos, plus a 13 yard 
run by Bill Kennedy, Gil Dissen 
took a Carricato aerial into the 
end zone and then converted.
The Bluejays took to the air in 
an effort to get back into the game 
but Skillin broke up the attempt 
with the fourth Tech interception 
on the opponents 25. The Tartans 
lost the ball on downs but Selvako 
fell on Myer’s fumble, Miller made 
5 yards on a quarterback sneak, 
then Schecter, taking a back pass 
from Miller, rolled for ten and 
the fourth Scot score.
Exchange Punts
DeVries made the last Clan in­
terception on the Tech 37 but in 
the following series of downs, 
neither eleven being able to move, 
they exchanged punts with Tech 
getting the best of the boots. Two 
successive first downs brought the 
Tartans to the two yard line where 
Warner bucked over. Carricato 
split the uprights for the fortieth 
point.
With both sides giving their 
substitutes a chance to get into the 
action, the game ended with the 
Blue and Black, having taken a 
60 yard kick-off by DeVries, punt­
ing from mid-field.

Bill Boyce, Math Grad, Barely 
Wins Closest Tartan Contest
“What an upset!” This was the cry that could be heard all over 
the nation last Saturday as crystal ball gazers moaned and groaned 
over many mispredictions.
The University of Pittsburgh’s stunning 22-19 win over Notre 
Dame fooled every one of the Tartan’s guessers. Only five out of 
the entire group that entered last week’s contest managed to predict 
the Yale-Columbia duel correctly. The thir-d most unsuspected upset 
was that of LSU over Kentucky, according to Carnegie’s swamis.
Four Tech students managed to predict all but two games cor­
rectly, making a close fourway race for the award. Bill Boyce, 
graduate math student, finally won out on a comparison of point 
spreads that is used by the Tartan staff to decide contests that end 
in a draw. The other three fell into second, third, and fourth places 
as follows: (2) George Liadis, sophomore metallurgist; (3) George 
Berringer, senior chem engineer; (4) Bob Carman, senior physics.
Three contestants predicted defeat for the Skibos in their battle 
with Johns Hopkins at Forbes Field, and many others predicted only 
one or two points margin for the Plaid.
Tartans Defeat Covies 
18-37; Place 7 of 10
Gillis and Olds Standout for Tech, 
Halferty Delays Use of Carman
Despite the absence of veteran pace setter, Bob Carman, the 
Tartan cross country team racked up a decisive victory over a weak 
Geneva squad, 18-37. The meet was held on the Covies home course, 
a 5 mile run. ?---------------------------------------------------------
Allegheny Is 
Next Opponent
Tartans Hold Large 
Series Edge, 11 to 5
This Saturday afternoon the 
Tartan eleven will travel to Mead- 
ville, Pa., where they will face the 
Allegheny Hilltoppers for the 
eighteenth time in the history oi 
competition between the two 
schools. The Plaid gridders hold 
an 11 to five edge over the 
Hilltoppers, one game having end­
ed in a tie.
The teams first met in 1903 and 
continued without a break until 
1918, when no game was schedul­
ed. The rivalry was renewed ia 
I 1919, continued through 1922, and 
, picked up again in 1950 when the 
Tartan club edged the Gators in a 
heart-breaking game at College 
field, Meadville, 14-13. The 1951 
meeting between the two ended ia 
a 39-0 triumph for the Plaid.
An interesting sidelight of the 
series is that, with the exception 
of the 1950 thriller, victories have 
been decisive regardless of the 
winner ... in thirteen of the sev­
enteen meetings, the loser has 
been shut out. Tech holds the :ec- 
ord for the highest score of a 
single game, having smashed the 
Gator 56-0 in 1921, and has out- 
scored the Gators 238 to 131 in 
the series to date. Allegheny last 
broke into the win column in 1914 
when it won its fourth in a row 
from the Tartans. Of the nine 
games played since then, Tech. 
has .start out the HiFto^pers im.
Male Gillis covered the course 
with a favorable time of 26:23 to 
take first place honors for the 
Plaid, and Arne Olds romped into 
second place. Sophomore George 
Jackson, Geneva track star, cop­
ped third place and was the first 
Geneva man to finish.
Coyle Ties Twice
A1 Hayes and Bill Coyle came 
in with a draw for fourth place, 
with John Muller placing sixth. 
This is the second consecutive 
meet that Coyle has finished the 
race in a tie for his position. Last 
week he was even up with Jim 
Flynn who, along with Coyle, are 
considered the “gold-dust twins.” 
This week Fylnn finished tenth, 
about a half step behind Tech’s 
Dave Robertson. Geneva copped 
both seventh and eighth places.
X-rays have revealed no bone 
cracks or chips in the ankle of 
Bob Carman, record setting Plaid 
runner, althbugh it is likely that 
the damage was done by a torn 
or ruptured tendon. Coach Guy 
Halferty may use Carman in the 
next meet against the Bisons from 
Bethany if enough improvement 
in the ankle permits him to run 
at a1!.
Bisons Tough
Bediany may prove to be one of
the toughest assignments the harr­
iers will meet this year. Two re­
turning lettermen who placed sec­
ond and fourth in last year’s Tri- 
State meet will add heavily to 
their veteran strength and they 
will be running on their home 
course.
An encouraging point that came 
out of the absence of Carman 
from the Tartan scoring column 
in the Geneva victory is the fact 
that one of the Tech runners who 
finished in the first ten was a 
junior—the rest were sophomores, 
freshmen, or irregulars. This cer­
tainly speaks well for the future 
of Tartan cross country running

Sophomore Chemistry 
Student, Sue Sullivan, 
Takes Runner-up Spot
On Tuesday, October 7, the first 
WAA swimming meet was held. 
High honors go to freshman Ann 
Fairbanks, who won two first- 
place ratings and one second place 
rating. Second high scorer was 
S u z i e Sullivan, a sophomore 
chemistry major, who took a first 
and two seconds.
Several of the girls who origin­
ally signified a desire to swim in 
intramural competition did not 
participate in the meet. These girls 
and any others who want to swim 
intramurally should submit their 
application blanks into the wom­
en’s physical education office as 
soon as possible. The next meet is 
scheduled for Tuesday, October 14, 
at 4:30 p.m.
Badminton
Any students interested in 
playing intramural badminton 
should submit their entries to 
the intramural office before Oc­
tober 17. Consult the intramural 
bulletin board in the gym for 
facts regarding rules and sched­
ules. Competition is scheduled 
to begin on October 21.
Intramural Roundup
Sigma Nu Best Choice To 
Take Intramural Honors
ATO’s Suffer Untimely Setback As Change In Schedule 
Causes Forfeit; Little Action In Tartan League Play
Only one more week remains in intramural football play, and+ 
as yet, none of the four league championships has been decided.
Sigma Nu “A” rolled to an easy 25-5 victory over the Obelisks, and
a 2 and 0 log.
Sigma Nu’s
The Sigma Nu’s took over first 
place in the Tartan hooper ratings 
with an 88.9 mark and appear to 
be the team to win the medals. 
They are, however, only a scant 3 
point choice to turn back the Tau 
Delta Phi squad in the battle for 
the Kiltie League laurels.
Delts vs. TX 
In Skibo league play, the pace- 
setting Delta Tau Delta sextet 
downed PiKA, 22-16, to clinch a 
tie for their league, while Theta Xi 
showed a good ground attack in 
walloping Beta Theta Pi, 31-10. 
After losing their first game, the 
revitalized TX squad came back to 
win their next two handily and 
now are the choice to beat the
Delts out for the crown. These two 
teams met last night in the game 
of the week* for the Skibo league 
crown.
Everything remained status 
in the Tartan league last week 
since no games were played. New­
man club and Delta Upsilon, both 
having spotless records will meet 
for the championship this week.
Schedule Changes
The ignorance of Alpha Tau 
Omega of a change in schedule 
proved to be their downfall as they 
failed to show up to play a second 
rate Roopsip team, and conse­
quently forfeited their first loss. 
Having the benefit of being in a 
weak league, the ATO’s should 
come back to snag the title despite 
this setback.

IM Board And 
Managers’ Club 
Change Rules
Punting Regulations 
Clarifled; Withdrawal 
Given Stiff Penalty
At the meeting of the Intramur­
al Managers’ club last Tuesday, 
October 7, Rule IX of the IM foot­
ball regulations was changed to 
read as follows:
A blocked kick, blocked by 
the receiving team, that does 
not cross the line of scrimmage 
will be dead at the spot; if it 
crosses the line of scrimmage, it 
will be a free ball and can be 
recovered and advanced by the 
receiving team or downed by 
the kicking team.
At a meeting of the Intramural 
Board on that same day, an 
amendment to the constitution of 
the IM program was approved. 
This amendment will help greatly 
arranging permanent schedules, 
eliminating mixups as to who plays 
who and when games are to be 
played. The amendment is as fol­
lows:
Any organization, indepen­
dent or otherwise, withdrawing 
a team from a league in any in­
tramural sport after the sched­
ule has been approved by the 
Intramural Board shall be fined 
a minimum of $7.00.
(a) The aforementioned or­
ganization shall be declared in­
eligible for further intramural 
competition until said fine is 
paid.
(b) Any member of afore­
mentioned organization shall 
also be declared ineligible for 
further intramural competition 
until said fine is paid.
(c) Payment of the fine shall 
be made to the secretary-treas­
urer of the Intramural Board.
(d) This by-law shall be en­
forced by the Intramural Board 
without discretion as to the type 
or organization or the reason* 
for withdrawal.

Council Meets 
New President
The first meeting of the Evening 
Student Council for this school 
year was held Sunday, October 5, 
at the Carnegie Union.
After convening the meeting, re­
tiring president Byron May in­
troduced the new officers of Coun­
cil. They are: Charles Keller,
president; Don Walker, vice presi­
dent; Marcella Sessi, secretary; 
and Vic Sabol, treasurer. The 
meeting was then turned over to 
the new president Charles Keller.
The unintentional errors in 
counting up points toward an In­
signia Award which led to Lester 
Blaho, Dick Gomrick and Warren 
Ihlenfeld not getting their first 
awards or mention in the Evening 
School handbook, was cause for 
considerable discussion. It was 
voted to record an apology to them 
in the minutes as well as give pub­
lic credit in this article. These 
men will receive their Insignia 
Awards as soon as they can be 
made by the engraver.

Flash! More parking space has 
been made available to evening 
students when it was found that 
the original area reserved for fac­
ulty was not needed. The space 
from the chain to the blinker at 
the end of Administration hall is 
now to be reserved for faculty, 
while the space previously set 
aside on the opposite side of the 
chain has now been opened to stu­
dents.
Made your tour through the new 
Industrial Administration yet? It 
was officially dedicated last week, 
you know.
The lack of newspapers earlier 
in the week was not due to any 
fault of the Plaid circulation man­
ager. Rather it was caused by an 
error by the day school circula­
tion staff. This, however, we have 
been assured will not occur again.
Enrollment Less, 
Most From Pa. 
Says Registrar
According to the official release 
from the registrar’s office, quite a 
few students are traveling from 
distant places to school this year. 
Although most students are from 
Pennsylvania, the evening school 
may also boast of students from 
Ohio and West Virginia.
The ten county breakdown in 
Pennsylvania shows 1082 for Alle­
gheny County, 479 of which are 
from Pittsburgh itself. Westmore­
land County is next with 83, then 
Butler with 30, Washington 23, 
and Beaver with 19. Fayette and 
Lawrence Counties are next in 
line with 3 each and last with 
one each are Cambria and Mercer 
Counties.
Columbia County, Ohio, sent 1 
while Hancock County, West Vir­
ginia, is represented by 2 stu­
dents. This year’s total is 104 less 
than last year. The total enroll­
ment for this year’s evening school 
classes is 1248.

Affected by Smoking Chesterfields
r
FIRST SUCH REPORT EVER PUBLISHED 
ABOUT ANY CIGARETTE
A responsible consulting organization has
reported the results of a continuing study by a 
competent medical specialist and his staff on the 
effects of smoking Chesterfield cigarettes.
A group Of people from various walks of life 
was organized to smoke only Chesterfields. For six 
months this group of men and women smoked their 
normal amount of Chesterfields — 10 to 40 a day. 
45% of the group have smoked Chesterfields con­
tinually from one to thirty years for an average of 
10 years each.
At the beginning and at the end of the six- 
months period each smoker was given a thorough
examination, including X-ray picture«, by the 
medical specialist and his assistants. The exam­
ination covered the sinuses as weM as the nose, 
ears and throat.
The medical specialist, after a thorough exam­
ination of every member of the group, stated:

! home 392 years later without dy­
ing in the meantime.
He was a remarkable fellow, 
born sometime close to the half 
century mark of the 1400’s, he be­
came a top-notch navigator with 
an idea. He married the daughter 
of a then famous navigator and 
set out to make a name for himself 
with his idea. He made a name 
for himself all right—crazy Co­
lumbus. For everyone knew the 
world was flat! He tried to con­
vince all the monarchs on the con­
tinent the value of his promised 
scheme, but failed.
Finds A Sucker
Christopher tried for 18 years 
to catch a sucker for his plot and 
finally found the friendly ear of 
Queen Isabella. She became inter­
ested in him. (History records that 
he was a handsome brute, tall and 
stately.) She financed the three 
ships that were to carry Columbus 
to fame.
On August 3, 1492, he set sail 
from Palos, Spain, to beat a path 
to the spice islands of the West 
Indies. After 21 days at sea, the 
boys of the crew decided this Co­
lumbus just had to go-overboard. 
With utmost courage, steadfast­
ness, and a couple of belaying pins,
S,C +Vi/% rvi i if i mr T? xr
time the next disturbance came 
up, old Chris had seen some signs 
of land. Filled to the brim with 
confidence shore was nearbly, he 
offered a reward to the first man 
who sighted it. With the ship’s sta­
bility thus endangered by all 
hands atop the masts, the little 
band sailed on through the mist 
of night.
After 85 days in the new world, 
old Chris had had enough. He 
packed up his tin dishes and went 
home, leaving a few of his party 
to start a colony. He pulled into 
Palos on the Ides of March, 1493 to 
a full-bloom ticker-tape reception.
He made a jecond voyage a 
couple of years later just to be 
sure the land was still there. It 
was, but his colony wasn’t. On his
third journey he ran afoul of Fer­
dinand.
Shipwrecked
Chris seemed to loose his luck 
with his third trip. After great 
trouble, he outfitted a fourth ex­
pedition but was shipwrecked off 
Jamaica (island not racetrack). 
His crew made log canoes to send 
for help at the colony, San Do­
mingo. The men he sent couldn’t 
persuade the colony to rescue Co­
lumbus, but the faithful crew 
worked hard for a year to buy a 
ship to go collect the now bearded 
navigator.
Christopher Columbus died in 
1506 in Spain. His greatest feat 
came after death because he willed 
that his remains be buried in the 
new world. His body was shipped 
across the Atlantic and buried in 
Cuba until 1898 when Cuba be­
came indepedent. Spain couldn’t 
stand to have its national hero 
buried in a foreign country, so 
what was left of poor old Chris 
after 392 years was shipped back 
to Spain.
Thus ends the saga of a great 
man—one who lived more years 
in the new world after death than 
any other Spanish hero.
