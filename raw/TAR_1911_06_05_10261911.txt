FACULTY GOLF TOURNAMENT 
ON IN EARNEST.
First Round Played—Faculty Chal­
lenge Students to Match.
The Faculty golf tournament is now 
going on in earnest. Messrs. Field, 
Mott and Milligan being the first to 
start on their qualifying round. The 
handicap committee has completed 
that part of its duty which has to do 
with the awarding of the handicaps 
and, with one exception, are receiv­
ing much praise for the manner in 
which they did the work. The one 
exception is the Chairman of the Com­
mittee who thinks his handicap too 
small but, as he was in Philadelphia 
watching the ball games instead of 
attending to his duties, he has no very 
strong ground upon which to stand. 
While all the scores have not as yet 
been turned in and it is impossible 
to give a list of them, those that have 
been are close and promise well for 
a bitterly fought tournament.
The tournament will be divided into 
two sections after the qualifying 
round, the first eight competing for 
the First Prize, and the second eight 
competing for the Consolation Prize. 
There will also be offered a prize for 
the lowest score made in the tourna­
ment. After the qualifying round the 
following rules will govern the handi­
caps. No handicaps will be given on 
holes number 6 to 13. Two-thirds of 
the handicap will be allowed in the 
following manner:

16 1-9-5-14-3-10-18-11-2-7-17-8-12-15-4-16 
Since all play is to be match play
and, after qualifying round only % of 
the awarded handicap is to be given, 
this will work out in the following 
manner. Suppose that a man had a 
handicap of 9 strokes he would be al­
lowed % of that or 6 strokes. These 
six strokes can now only be applied 
to holes number 1, 9, 5, 14, 3, 10, the 
other holes being played even. The 
first round must be finished by Wed­
nesday, November 1st.
Faculty Challenge Students.
The committee having the matter 
in charge desire to challenge the win­
ner of the student tournament, the 
match to be played at the conclusion
of the two matches. All students de­
siring to enter the student tourna­
ment may do so, provided that they 
hand their names in to Mr. Milligan 
in Mr. Orbin’s office on or before 
Friday evening, October 27th. The 
students should realize on this chance 
to enter active competition with the 
Faculty and make things interesting 
for the Dispensers of Knowledge. 
There are many students who play the 
game and they should enter immedi­
ately. Two students who handed their 
names in last Friday will please do 
so again as the paper was misplaced.
The following are the rules laid 
down for the Faculty Tournament:
The following rules are laid down 
for the course:
General Rule 1—A ball may be 
lifted at any point and placed any­
where not nearer the hole, with a 
penalty of two strokes.
General Rule 2—A ball driven from 
the Tee into any of the roads on the 
course when not out of bounds, 
player may place ball in the middle 
of the road with loss of one stroke.
General Rule 3—If a ball goes out 
of bounds it must be taken back and 
re-played from the same point for a 
penalty of one stroke. If played from 
the Tee it may be re-teed, otherwise 
it must be dropped over the shoul­
der. (All ground outside of Park 
limits is out of bounds.)
General Rule 4 — A lost ball is 
treated as though played out of 
bounds.
Hole 1.
A ball driven into or beyond the 
road to the left is out of bounds.
Hole 2.
A ball driven from the Tee into 
or beyond the road to the left is out 
of bounds.
Hole 3.
A ball driven from the Tee into 
or beyond the road on the right is 
out of bounds.
Hole 7.
A ball driven from the Tee to the 
right of the house is out of bounds.
MECHANICAL ENGINEERING 
SOCIETY.
The Carnegie Mechanical Engineer­
ing Society of these Schools met last 
Saturday evening and heard a lecture 
on the Panama Canal, delivered by 
Professor Mott, of the Civil Depart­
ment.
In spite of the inclement weather, 
there was a good attendance present. 
Mr. Mott began at the Atlantic side 
of the canal and wound up at the 
Pacific side of same.
His lantern slides portrayed all the 
striking features of the great under­
taking, including the massive masonry 
locks at Gatum and the great Culebra 
cut.
THE BUTTON’S THE THING.
Be Sure You Get One.
The “Tartan” believes that Tech 
men should get in line with the ag­
gressive campaign that is now being 
made to put Pittsburgh up a notch 
or two in all things that make for 
civic and commercial betterment. Pro­
verbially lean of pocket, as most col­
lege students are, we cannot hope to 
over-subscribe that $250,000 fund 
which the Industrial Development 
Commission is so valiantly raising, but 
we can at least do something to let 
the good people who are shouldering 
the brunt of the work know that we 
are “with them.”
So the “Tartan” has a proposition 
to make. It isn’t alarmingly original, 
and it isn’t likely to put Pittsburgh 
ahead of New York in the next cen­
sus, but it will at any rate show that 
our hearts are in the right place. We 
have just acquired, through the gen­
erosity of an anonymous well-wisher, 
5,000 boost buttons. The design, the 
work of one of us, carries the four 
colors of the college plaid, the city 
emblem, and a slogan which ties to­
gether two things that can get us on 
our cheering feet at any time. “For 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Tech.”
Upon the future of these two de­
pends very vitally our own futures. 
Our graduates, as the years roll on, 
will scatter in greater and greater 
numbers to the four corners of the 
world, but on the final show-down by 
far the biggest percentage of us will 
be found here in Father Pitt’s good 
old hamlet earning our ham and eggs. 
And it doesn’t take a Socrates to fig­
ure out that the more fine old indus­
trial porkers Squire Pitt has in baili­
wick then, the more bacon will come 
our way.
So the button, gentlemen, is the 
thing. It isn’t much, but it will let 
every passerby know that we’re all 
good scouts for Pittsburgh. Wear it! 
Do that much, ar^d then consider how 
you can do more.
We expect to have these celluloid 
talismans ready for distribution in 
Room 1 of the lower corriddor of the 
Industries Building next week. In all 
probability you’ll get one gratis along 
with the next copy of the ‘T'artan.” If 
you lose it or pass it on to some other
good fellow, come back and get an­
other. We’ll do our part as long as 
you will do yours.
Remember, the button’s the thing. 
It will be for a while the little badge 
of loyalty to your city and to your 
college. Without it, you’re a credit 
to neither.
THIRD VICTORY BROUGHT 
HOME.
Carnegie Wins from Muskingum.
On a field that was a veritable sea 
of mud, Carnegie Tech won from 
Muskingum College, at New Concord, 
Ohio, last Saturday, by a score of 15 
to 0. Neither team could display fast 
football, and the game resolved itself 
into a kicking contest. McKean and 
Schmucker were the star punters for 
the Plaid, while Wishart and Johnson 
booted for the home team.
Carnegie’s first touchdown was 
scored in the second quarter. A punt­
ing duel opened the period and was 
ended with the ball in Carnegie’s pos­
session on Muskingum’s 10-yard line. 
A forward pass, Balsinger to 
Schmucker, netted the necessary dis­
tance. Schmucker failed to kick goal.
In the third quarter, Schmucker at­
tempted to kick a field goal from the 
20-yard line, but failed on account of 
the slippery condition of the ball. 
Later, in the same period, the ball 
was carried from the middle of the 
field to the 10-yard mark on a suc­
cession of short runs. From here, 
Balsinger scored the second tuchdown 
on a line buck. Schmucker failed in 
the try at goal.
Shortly before the end of the game, 
Balsinger scored on an end run, after 
the usual exchange of punts, Schmuck­
er failed, for the third time, to kick 
goal.

THE BAND.
There is an organization which is 
doing a good work and doing it 
quietly, and that is the Band. Noth­
ing is ever heard about them or from 
them except at the games, and as a 
result very few of the student-body 
appreciate the work and sacrifices of 
those men composing it. They have 
regular rehearsal hours and they are 
well and faithfully attended, as the 
results surely show.
We would like to see more inter­
est in this organization shown by the 
student-body at large. They deserve 
it. The TARTAN wishes to here ex­
press its appreciation of the work of 
the Band.
—o—
ONCE MORE—THE MUDDY 
TRAIL.
—o—
When the semester opened one of 
the first things commented on by 
the students was the “Muddy Trail.” 
Nothing was done to improve its con­
dition and the TARTAN, on behalf 
of those students, day and night, who 
were compelled to wade through the 
mud, published its first article on the 
subject, the same being in the form 
of a short editorial, entitled “The 
Muddy Trail.” With full expecta­
tions that something would be done 
to remedy the situation, a week was 
allowed to pass without anything fur­
ther being said on the subject. On 
the following week an article and a 
cartoon were run, the TARTAN hop­
ing to thus stir somebody into action. 
We were doomed to disappointment, 
however, for, up to the present writ­
ing, nothing has been done to relieve 
the situation.
Just why no action has been taken 
on this matter we do not pretend to 
be able to say. It certainly is a case 
for attention. The continual rains
this fall have turned the walk into 
such a quagmire that it is absolutely 
impossible to pass over it without 
covering shoes and clothes with sticky 
clay. For the day students it is bad 
enough, but for the night students, it 
is infinitely worse, there being no 
lights whatever to aid one in side­
stepping the worst of the puddles. 
Why such a situation should be passed 
unnoticed when continually called to 
attention is absolutely beyond our 
comprehension.
Unless immediate steps are taken 
to alleviate the condition or satisfac­
tory reasons given for not doing so, 
the TARTAN suggests that a peti­
tion be circulated among those using 
the walk and that this petition be 
given to the proper authorities. We 
feel certain that this will not be neces­
sary and that those who have the 
matter in charge will realize that it 
is unfair to bother the members of 
the Faculty and of the student-body 
who use that entrance to force them 
to walk several times daily over such 
a mess of mud and shale and will pro­
ceed to take steps to relieve the con­
dition.
—o—
Why are the Science Freshmen 
allowed to attend the football games 
without their small blue caps? The 
Design and Industry Freshmen turn 
out to a man in the proper headgear. 
It looks to us like another case for 
immediate attention, this time by the 
Science upper classmen.
Under the new tariff act, frankfur­
ters will be admitted free of duty 
to this country. Lucky dogs!
—o—
Mr. Benjamin E. Birge, formerly 
an instructor in English in the School 
of Applied Industries, is a candidate 
on the Republican ticket for the 
County Treasurership in Schuyler 
County, New York State. We wish 
him all success.
It is rumored that a certain gentle­
man of the Design School chooses 
his food with an eye to interior deco­
ration rather than nourishment.
Considering the way in which most 
football teams have been treated, we 
have fared well. Carnegie, 32; op­
ponents, 6.
Many students took advantage of 
the team’s being away from home 
and saw the Indians play Pitt. They 
also saw some excellent work on the 
part of the Pitt cheer leaders.
—o—
The TARTAN hoped to have some 
good pictures of the meet but they 
were spoiled and unfit for use.
Let’s make it four straight.
Bright student, after Prof. Colette 
has addressed him in French, “I 
understand what you say, but I don’t 
know what you mean.

THE TARTAN3
APPLIED INDUSTRIES NOTES.
Another engine lathe, a 7'x 16", I. 
H. Johnson, has been added to the 
machine shop.
* * *
In naming the officers of the 
Freshman Class, the Tartan confused 
the Secretary with the Vice-President. 
Vice-President is Voelker and the Sec­
retary is Schulte.
* * *
Ralph Kinter says he hopes they 
soon get the automatic joiner in the 
pattern shop repaired. This makes it 
unanimous.
* * *
Once more we urge upon each of 
the classes the importance of appoint­
ing a “Tartan” representative. If your 
class is not represented in the “Tar­
tan,” don’t blame your School Editor, 
he cannot keep in touch with all the 
classes, but he is ready to edit all 
news items you may contribute and 
to see that the classes are represented. 
Give him your co-operation.
* * *
An error was made in last week’s 
“Tartan” regarding the forged steel 
ring being constructed in the forge 
shop. It read “2-inch” and should 
be “2-foot.”* * *
The Draftsmen’s Club for 1911-12 
has organized and elected the follow­
ing officers: Pres., J. C. Erwin; Vice 
President, W. E. Laughner; Sec. F. B. 
Blattenberger; Treas., J. H. Randolph. 
An account of the organization will 
occur in the next issue.* * *
A meeting of Freshmen was held 
on Friday, October 20th, in Room 
104, Vice President Voelker presiding. 
Heffley was elected Tartan represen­
tative.
Artists of Pittsburgh, opening No­
vember 1, at the Institute, should be 
visited by every student in Design.* * *
We are to have a mascot unlike any 
that has yet been known around Car­
negie Tech. The architect who is in­
clined to Sunday labors over the 
drawing board need no longer plug 
away in voiceless solitude, through 
the absence of conversationally in­
clined fellow-workers. Yes, peruser 
of this authentic sheet, it will be a 
parrot, who, it is guaranteed by the 
promoters, will be the most talkative 
bird obtainable. Be his vocabulary 
as large as it may, it will know no 
limits when he begins to absorb “at­
mosphere” from his perch in the cen­
ter of the upper draughting room.* * *
Among the jurors chosen to pass 
upon the pictures for the second an­
nual exhibition of the Associated Ar­
tists of Pittsburgh, are Arthur W. 
Sparks and George W. Sotter. Both 
men are of the Design Faculty.* * *
Stop the purchase of that parrot! 
What if he really should repeat all 
that he will hear?
APPLIED DESIGN NOTES.
A masquerade dance, given by the 
Design School, will be held Thursday 
evening, November 2, in the Conserv­
atory of Music. All students of the 
School of Design with their friends 
are invited and a general good time 
seems assured. The fee is one dollar 
and a half a couple, and there are 
two requirements, first that every one 
attending be masked; second that 
tickets be purchased from the com 
mittee before the evening of the 
dance. No tickets are to be sold at 
the door.
One other requirement, if not re­
quired at least necessary to the sue 
cess of the evening—every Design man 
and girl should be there. Come every 
body, it is a guaranteed good time. 
Get a costume, if it has to be a bar­
rel, and a mask, if it has to be a 
home-made paper affair, but be there! 
* * *
At a recent meeting of the School 
of Applied Design, it was decided that 
the Class A men wear a silver mount­
ed cane, and that the Class B students 
choose any style they may wish to 
wear. This movement is the result 
of Mr. Hornbostel’s suggestion that 
the Architects adopt some custom ¡to 
be peculiar to themselves.? * *
The exhibition of the Associated
T. A. C. SMOKER.
The Tech Architectural Club 
smoker at the German Club on the 
17th was a very successful affair in 
every way. Nearly the entire mem­
bership turned out and many invited 
guests were present. After lunch had 
been served, smokes were passed 
around, and the speeches began, Mr. 
Mood and Mr. Hall being the guests 
of honor. The latter specialized on 
the value of recreation, while the 
former gave a talk of a more serious 
nature, drawing from his experience 
in architecture, both as a student and 
in practice, the points which had most 
impressed him. Following this, other 
guests of the club, including several 
members of the faculty, were called 
upon for brief talks and all were 
applauded in the traditional Carnegie 
way, either by the “Short Speller” or 
the “Long Carnegie.” The entertain­
ment committee deserves much credit 
for the success of the affair.

Plebe Reception.
A very enjoyable afternoon was 
spent last Friday, October thirteenth, 
at the reception that was given by the 
faculty and Seniors to the Plebe Class.
This reception is given yearly for 
the purpose of effecting a formal in­
troduction of the entering class to 
the Faculty and old students of the 
school.
Music added greatly to the enjoy­
ment of the afternoon, at which time, 
two of the Plebes distinguished them­
selves by singing solos. By the way, 
they have joined the Glee Club.
Light refreshments were then served 
by the Senior Household Arts girls; 
after which the party broke up and 
the suit-case procession started for 
home.
Notice.
The order for passing out of the 
assembly was not observed by the 
Plebe class on Monday last. Plebes! 
take warning!
The girls of the M. M. C. S. 
had a rare treat on Monday, October 
5, in the choral singing hour.
Miss Stoner was in England during 
the summer, studying the Morris 
dances. These dances in earlier times 
were given by the English peasants 
during certain festive seasons, but 
they are now danced by country folk 
and also the better class.
Six dancers take part in these 
dances, though additional characters 
such as “Maid Marian,” “Robin Hood” 
and “Friar Tuck” are usually intro­
duced. There are also two musicians 
and sometimes one of the dancers, 
more richly dressed than the others, 
acts as “Squire” or head of the Mor­
ris.
Miss Stoner, with the assistance of 
Miss Eastman, reproduced some of 
these interesting dances for us. Each 
wore the picturesque English cos­
tume which consisted of an organdie 
dress trimmed with a white fichu. 
The dress was completed by a dainty 
little white apron, which reached to 
the knees. On the ankles little bells 
were worn which tinkled merrily 
with each step of the dancers. The 
hair was arranged in two braids and 
covered with a pink sunbonnet. Miss 
Eastman and Miss Stoner danced 
“The Princess Royal” together, at 
the conclusion of which Miss , Stoner 
danced “Jockey to the Fair/? In ad­
dition to the dances, Miss Stoner sang 
some very pleasing little English bal­
lads.

SCRUBS TIE.
The Scrubs played their first game 
off home grounds Saturday when As­
sistant Manager Finkel took them to 
New Kensington to play the New 
Kensington High School. The game, 
although a little loosely played, was 
stubbornly fought and full of interest. 
The fact that neither side scored will 
testify that each team was doing its 
best. The Scrubs’ line held fast at 
all times and they repeatedly made 
their downs, but New Kensington ex­
celled in kicking and thereby kept the 
Scrubs away from their goal. Phelan, 
of Carnegie, was conspicuous through­
out the game in the numberless line 
bucks which he successfully executed 
Washam and McGill featured also and 
many times did the little right end 
break through the opposing line and 
down the runner with a loss. The 
most exciting time of the game was 
in the second quarter. The Scrubs 
had the ball on the 5-yard line. It 
seemed as if they surely would be 
able to carry it over the line, but a 
little slowness on the part of the back- 
field was responsible for the ball re­
turning to New Kensington, who with 
their customary despatch, kicked it 
out of danger. The longest gain of 
the game, about 20 yards, was made 
by means of a forward pass from 
Hall to Beecher. Luffy, Ward, Sheers 
and Glock starred foy the High 
School. The game was, on the whole, 
satisfactory and noticeably clean. The 
Scrubs received good treatment from 
New Kensington, and it is to be hoped 
that they may meet again next year.
