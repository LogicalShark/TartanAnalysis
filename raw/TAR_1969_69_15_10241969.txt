Art Gallery 
Makes Plans 
For Opening
The “Let’s-Make-the-Pharma- 
cy-an-Art-Gallery Crew” is now 
proud of an exhibition gallery run 
and operated by students. After 
so many months of patronizing, 
emphathizing and working, the 
former Woodlawn Pharmacy is 
beginning to look like an art gal­
lery. During the past few weeks 
students have completely reno­
vated the building that once hous­
ed the pharmacy. Administrators 
and faculty have contributed ev­
erything from nails to simple, but 
necessary, support.
The opening of the Carnegie- 
Mellon University Student Art 
Gallery will be held on Sunday eve­
ning, October 26, from 7 to 10 
in the completed art gallery. The 
opening student art exhibition, 
contributed by students through­
out the University, will be pre­
sented at this time. It is to be a 
formal affair open to the campus 
community, black tie optional.
Whatever shape the gallery is 
in on Sunday evening, the direc­
tors would like to give their thanks 
to Dean Swank. Dr. Kibbee, Carl 
Thomas, President Stever, Pat 
Howley, Rodger Schmidt, Jim 
Kerr, Joe Makissic. Joseph Con­
struction Company, Chuck Costo- 
lo, Frank Montag, John Payne, 
and Ralf Waldo Emerson and their 
staffs. The gallery could not have 
been accomplished without their 
sincere and willing support.
Von Braun 
To Speak 
At C-MU
Dr. Werhner von Braun, rocket 
expert and renowned space sci­
entist. will discuss the future of 
the nation’s space program Wed­
nesday, Oct. 29. at 8 p.m. in 
Skibo’s Ballroom.
Dr. von Braun’s lecture is en­

from the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration (NASA) 
and the Bendix Corporation. The 
space agency is also making 
Huntsville staff members avail­
able to students in the program 
for consultation on various space 
problems.
Dr. von Braun is presently 
heading the development of Sat­
urn launch vehicles for Project 
Appollo. the manned lunar pro­
gram.

Officer Shot at Pitt 
Culprit Gets Away
A University of Pittsburgh security guard was shot in the chest 
Tuesday night during a struggle with a burglar he surprised in the Pitt 
Student Union.
That Students Be Seated on Councils
Student Senate has requested 
that three students be elected to 
each of the three C-MU College 
Councils. Presently there are 
councils in H&SS-MMCC, CIT and 
Fine Arts, but no students sit on 
these boards, although each has 
the power to make important de­
cisions regarding curriculum and 
other college matters.
So far. Dean Steinberg, chair­
man of the H&SS-MMCC Council, 
has officially agreed to place stu­
dents on the Council. Steinberg’s 
agreement is somewhat condition­
al, however. The Dean would not 
agree to let students take part in 
any discussions other than those 
directly pertaining to academic 
matters. If personal disputes of 
any kind were to come up. Stein­
berg feels that students should 
not be present because these mat­
ters might be too confidential. It 
is hoped, however, that the strings 
will be cut, and students will be 
allowed to sit in on all facets of 
the Council’s deliberations.
CIT Dean William Mullins has 
given Student Senate a personal 
commitment in favor of the pro­
posal. but it remains for him to 
bring the matter up before the 
next session of the Council in 
CIT. Mullins has further agreed 
that no strings would be attached 
if students are allowed to sit on 
the committee.
Norman Rice, head of Fine Arts, 
has not been available for com­
ment as yet. but it is hoped that 
his affirmative reply will be forth­
coming within the week.
Student participation in all fac­
ets of University government has 
long been the trend here at C-MU. 
Presently there are students in 
Councils of the Faculty Senate, 
specifically on the Educational 
Policy Council, and the Student 
Affairs Council. Three students.
Pat Cavannah. Carol Schloss, and 
Joe Duckworth sit on the Presi­
dent’s Policy Advisory Board, and 
students also have equal repre­
sentation on a subcommittee of 
that board, the President’s Emer­
gency Advisory Board.
Since the College Councils have 
power to act on all policy within 
the individual colleges, it is hoped 
that students will soon have a 
voice in those organizations as
well. Student Government plans to 
launch an all-college mail-out as 
soon as official word is received 
from Fine Arts and CIT. Students 
will be asked to nominate the 
three delegates to each Council, 
and later to vote on those nom­
inated. Student activism is en­
couraged through the official po­
licy-making boards of the Uni­
versity.
Students seem to want to get in­
volved, said Student Senate Presi­
dent Joe Duckworth. Here is an 
opportunity for them to further 
their own contribution to Univer­
sity government. Past student in­
volvement on administrative coun­
cils has been positive. Students 
have already proven themselves 
a worthy contribution to delibera­
tions in other groups. Now it is 
time for them to contribute to the 
most important council each ol- 
lege has. the College Councils.

Reported in “satisfactory” condition in Presbyterian-University 
Hospital is Richard Delaney, 43, of 232 38th Street, Lawrenceville.
Officer Delaney and Sgt. Henry 
Warbas were making a routine 
check of the university’s food 
service office about 11 p.m. 
Tuesday night when they came 
upon the burglar.
The burglar was ordered to 
stand spreadeagled against the 
wall, but he whirled around and 
grabbed Officer Delaney as the 
policeman began to frisk the sus­
pect.
In the process, accroding to Sgt. 
Warbas. the burglar grabbed Offi­
cer Delaney’s service revolver 
fired a shot, wounding the police­
man.
The burglar fled through an ad­
joining kitchen and out a door. Sgt. 
Warbas fired once at the fleeing 
burglar before turning to aid his 
fallen partner.
City police and K-9 units 
searched the campus unsuccess­
fully for the suspect.
The suspect is five feet nine 
inches tall, black, with a mous­
tache and bushy hair not too long. 
He was wearing a three-quarter 
length tan coat and possibly has a 
head injury.
The suspect used the officer’s 
gun to shoot the guard.

LETTERS TO THE EDITORFrat Removes 
Rebel Banner
I am a member of the fra­
ternity that on occasion has a con­
federate flag flying from one of 
its windows. This last Sunday 
morning a Negro entered our 
house and told us that if the flag 
was not removed by the evening, 
he would see that it was removed 
for us. Sunday evening came 
and the flag was still draped out 
of the window. At about 8:15, 
twelve Negroes entered our house 
to ask that the flag be removed 
very soon or they would return to 
remove it. Not wishing to invite an 
incident of the order that seem­
ed to be in the making, we re­
moved the flag.
In no way do I espouse the 
I believe that this group which in­
sisted on the removal of the flag 
was in the wrong. They had no 
more right to ask its removal and 
then threaten to remove it if their 
request was not fulfilled, than a 
stranger would in asking me to 
cuy my hair and then threaten to 
cut it himself if I did not. There 
contemptible intimation of vio­
lence struck me as particularly 
ironic. So many people have strug­
gled, fought and died in order 
that equality for all would prevail 
and now, the people who have 
been the prime recipient of what 
has been accomplished, are adopt­
ing the attitudes and tactics of 
those who fought to deny equal­
ity to this group. Black racism is 
just as bad as white racism. By 
trying to stifle another’s thoughts, 
you are encouraging the sup­
pression of your own thoughts and 
beliefs. We should all be more 
concerned with creating an at­
mosphere of free discussion and 
acceptance than with trying to 
blot out an opinion because it of­
fends us.
Pete Principe
More Security
Editor, The Tartan:
It’s hardly surprising that non­
students from the neighborhood 
are bold enough to attack stu­
dents on campus property. The 
whole campus area is so dark that 
one can hardly see where one is 
going, much less detect a student 
in trouble. Increasing security 
forces is doubtless far more ex­
pensive than installing de­
cent lighting, and an increase of 
men patrolling the area is use­
less if they can’t see what is go­
ing on around campus.
Janiva Borowska 
Graduate Physics
Keep MMCC
Editor, The Tartan:
I guess I really don’t know 
where to begin this plea for re­
cognition and the revamping of 
the Business and Home Ec. de­
partments here at C-MU. Notice 
that I am not talking about 
MMCC for women. That college
is outdated and leaves a bad 
taste in everyones mouth, (and 
most of all mine).
MMCC is not an ode to mother­
hood. It won’t fertilize the womb! 
But two departments here at C- 
MU are about to become extinct, 
and they are two departments 
that are definitely needed to fur­
ther the “practical” education for 
women in our university and in 
our society.
Granted, women find that when 
they vie for the same job as 
men (even with the same qualifi­
cations) they are “put-down.” The 
interviewer may say, “Do you 
take shorthand and typing dear? 
Then we may have an opening in 
our office for you.” Acquiring a 
background in these skills is the 
only way “to get your foot in the 
door!” (thank you, Dr. Leffing- 
well for coining a beautiful 
phrase).
I hope that you all don’t think 
that shorthand and typing is all 
we learn in business, or that sew­
ing and baking is all that Home 
Ec. majors take. Business students 
also take courses in language, 
psychology, English, statistics, 
Human Relations, Finance. Mar­
keting, Industrial Administra­
tion, Economics, etc., etc., etc. 
We get out of here with a fine 
liberal arts education AND (and 
note this all of you history and 
English majors) we are able to get 
very good jobs. No business ma­
jor ever has to worry about where 
her next meal is coming from 
when she graduates from this 
lovely institution. So all of you 
poor history, psych., and Eng­
lish majors who get out of here 
and can’d do anything but cry a 
lot or go onto grad school, come 
on over to. MMCC and sign up for 
typing and shorthand. These 
courses are open to everyone, you 
know (at no extra charge).
Getting back to the original 
problem. It seems to me that 
MMCC (cherish that abbrevia­
tion, it may one day be an anti­
que) has gond down hill for the 
past 20 years or more because of 
external forces that have acted 
upon it. The dean (what is his 
name again?) has never really 
cared about the college or its 
image, recruiting people have never 
pushed its existence, there has 
been little effort made to get 
“new blood” into the Home- Ec. 
department in the form of new 
and young teachers, the MMCC 
building itself is falling apart 
(God only knows why they are 
bothering to fix it up this year 
after all these past years of peel­
ing plaster), and most importantly, 
the campus wide image of MMCC 
girls is one of “low - woman on 
the totem pole.” Well, if our stan­
dards for admission here are not 
up to university standards, then 
whose fault is that (hello, Warn­
er Hall!). Then there are the 
people who have the misconcep­
tion that women entering MMCC 
cannot afford the rising tutition 
costs. These people should ask 
around and they will find that 
most of us are NOT on scholar­
ships. Our parents are making 
out just fine.
Don’t you see that MMCC 
women will not let the adminis­
tration close down MMCC with­
out batting an eye-lash? We are 
going to fight to keep our depart­
ments alive here on campus. Let 
MMCC die with all of its ugly 
connotations, but the departments 
will live on.
The women in Business Studies 
and Home Ec. want to strengthen 
our fields. We want to improve 
our curriculum and are willing 
to gry to completely revamp our 
present system. We need every­
one’s help on and across the erf- 
tire campus. Once MMCC goes.
other departments and colleges 
will follow. Do you want this 
to happen to you??
Hilary Kruzweil 
Business Studies ’70 
Note to all men on campus — who
may have any doubts:
A women’s supplementary sal­
ary of $5500 — $8000 a year is al­
ways just the slightest bit help­
ful in running a household and 
making life a little bit more 
pleasant. The education we get 
here gets that salary for us next 
year!!!
Not Informed
Dear Editor,
It appears that my letter in 
the last TARTAN, based as it was 
on the information available at the 
time of writing, inadvertantly 
did some injustice to members 
of the administration. I apologize 
for that.
However, I must wonder why 
the facts in the matter, pertinent 
as they are to the student body, 
could not have been released 
sooner.
With all sorts of regrets
Steve Jurman
Let Students 
Elect Trustee
Editor, The Tartan:
Your coverage of the Mora­
torium Day panel on campus 
militarism was quite accurate, 
apart from one serious error: 
Paul Garver’s remarks were at­
tributed to me, and mine to him. 
One suggestion proposed in that 
discussion, which I should like 
to see discussed more widely on 
campus, but which was not men­
tioned in your news story, was 
the proposal that students elect 
some new members to the Board 
of Trustees. At present, students, 
faculty, labor and black people 
are not represented at all, and wo­
men are severely under-repres­
ented. Since students are deeply 
affected by the decisions this 
body makes, it seems fitting to 
me that students should take the 
initiative in holding elections 
which those groups who are pre­
sently unrepresented could choose 
delegates to represent them on this 
body.
Students who wish to concern 
themselves with this issue might 
do well to begin by informing 
themselves about the present 
white business-dominated com­
position of the Board and the way 
its actions affect education at 
CMU. A detailed discussion of 
these topics may be found in a 
pamphlet recently published by 
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance, ti­
tled, Carnegie-Mellon University, 
an Analysis of Ownership and Con­
trol. Copies are on sale at 
the school bookstore, and next week 
in the lobby of Skibo Monday 
through Friday during the lunch 
hour, at 40c, and by mail from 
the Resistance, 3406 Fifth Aven­
ue, Pittsburgh 15213, at 50c. Your 
readers should be aware that an 
article with the same title, pub­
lished in The Relative Truth was 
not the same text as the above 
pamphlet, but an emasculated, 
highly condensed and poorly 
edited version of the pamphlet; 
the text of the article was not ap­
proved by the author of the pam­
phlet prior to the article’s pub­
lication. nor would it have been 
approved had it been submitted 
to him for approval, prior to 
publication
David F. Greenberg 
Pittsburgh Draft Resistance
Spock Urges
Editor, The Tartan:
We have all been through a lot 
together over the past few years, 
trying to convince our friends 
and perfect strangers, our neigh­
bors and those who govern this 
country that the war against Viet­
nam is immoral, unjust and must 
be stopped!
Now we are experiencing the 
fruits of our labors. The talking, 
marching, the resisting and the 
praying have swung the pendulum 
of public opinion. Now the ma­
jority of Americans clearly in­
sist that the United States with­
draw its troops from Vietnam.
Today we stand at the cross­
roads of our struggle. If we lapse 
into a false sense of security, 
surely we will fail. If we de­
dicate ourselves to accelerate 
the level of dissent against the 
war, surely we will win.
The New Mobilization Com­
mittee to End the War in Viet­
nam has called for a “March 
Against Death” and a massive 
demonstration and rally in Wash­
ington, D. C., November 13-15. 
This must be the largest most ef­
fective, and the last demonstra­
tion against the war.
I plan to join Mrs. Coretta 
King, the Rev. William Sloane 
Coffin, Dr. George Wiley and 
hundreds of thousands of 
Americans there. I sincerely hope 
that you will be there too.
Dr. Benjamin Spock
NOTICE:
Any time a group of 
students goes to Dean 
Swank to discuss a 
current issue on cam­
pus, he is willing to 
schedule an open 
meeting to talk about 
it.

Editorial
In light of the recent attacks on persons both on our 
campus and at the University of Pittsburgh, we feel strongly 
that it is of the utmost necessity to take every precaution pos­
sible in an effort to prevent further injury.
Many students, expecially girls, walk across campus at 
night alone from the computation center to Morewood. There­
fore, in an effort to alleviate much of this traffic, we recom­
mend that a punch card machine be set up immediately in More- 
wood Gardens.

mind.’ Listen and then make your 
own choice. We have attempted to 
plan an unbiased program in order 
not to persuade or force your de­
cision in any one direction. Thus, 
the decision is a personal one. one 
which you (and only you) must 
make for yourself. Drugs: will 
they turn you on. or will they turn 
on you ... a question we must ask 
and answer ourselves!! ’’
Speaking on the posititve side 
will be Paul Krassner, who has 
willingly bucked the establish­
ment and asked the question: will 
drugs spoil the system? As the 
founder and editor of the Realist, 
his voice has been echoed from 
coast to coast.
"For the past ten years Krass­
ner has been hacking away at so­
ciety's sacred cows—motherhood, 
the Pope, sexual mores, the flag 
(and himself) — with corrosive, 
outrageous humor.
As editor of the Realist, Krass­
ner finds himself the precursor 
and perhaps the dean of the under­
ground press.” Krassner will tell 
it like he sees it and openly tell 
anyone to do “it” if he wants to.
Taking the opposing viewpoint 
will be Robert Moorman, past as­
sociate of Timothy Leary and ex­
addict. Moorman has turned on, 
tuned in. and dropped out and dur­
ing these years he experimented 
with marijuana, morphine, hero­
ine. LSD mescaline, solvents and 
glues, romalar, amphetamines 
(pep pills) and various other as­
sorted pills from time to time.
The end of the road for the drug 
dependent Robert Moorman came 
in 1966 when he was arrested in 
Tampa, Fla., for grand larceny 
and possession of narcotics. Dur­
ing his confinement behind the 
fences of the Florida State and 
County Prison System. Robert 
Moorman began a most painful 
and agonizing rehabilitation. It is 
of these and other experiences 
that Moorman will speak during 
the Forum on Drugs in his lec­
ture. "The Burning Issue.”
Thank You whoever you are, please contact

Want to do some oood?
The Pennsylvania Department of High­
ways wants to help you do just this. Make 
a safer and more secure future for yourself 
and millions of Americans, by helping plan 
Pennsylvania’s highways. The need for 
faster highways, that will carry more vehi­
cles, creates an unusual engineering prob­
lem. This is a challenging goal which only 
the best Civil Engineers can tackle. Imag­
inative, intellectually aggressive, and vi­
sionary men are the only kind we can use.
If you fit the description, the Pennsylvania 
Department of Highways wants you. We will 
offer promotions, benefits, and high start­
ing salaries.

by Murray Singer
The very small audience that 
attended last Thursday’s lunch­
time forum was addressed by 
Bishop Roy Nichols of the United 
Methodist Church of Pittsburgh. 
Although his topic was “Repara­
tions and the Black Community,” 
Bishop Nichols spent most of his 
time discussing his impressions 
of the state of American society.
He began by describing the 
three waves of “erruption” that 
those over 50 have experienced. 
The first wave was generated by 
the New Deal program which was 
developed in response to the hor­
rors of the depression. The sec­
ond corresponds to the campus 
peace prior to World War II, in­
cluded large groups of students 
until it was discredited when the 
Russians announced that they had 
been one of the underlying forces. 
Finally, the surge of anti-Estab- 
lishment feeling which is associ­
ated with the Civil Rights move­
ment and the Vietnam War in­
volves a large proportion of the 
nation’s youth.
Bishop Nichols pointed out sev­
eral differences of the “third
wave.” Although there has always 
been a brash and radical element 
among the white youth, it is now 
that for the first time, men and 
women in the black community 
have decided that they too will be 
heard. A second difference is the 
level of sophistication of youth in 
general, and, more specifically, its 
leadership. Never before has 
there been so widespread a move­
ment of activist people desiring 
their freedom and self-determin- 
ation. For this reason, Bishop 
Nichols felt that the United States 
would have a difficult time im­
posing its will on people of appar­
ently less powerful nations.
Bishop Nichols continued by ad­
vising that we not “get carried 
away about the bombs,” that the 
money wasted on the ABM was 
as futile as that spent on the 
French Maginot line which crum­
bled before the German onslaught 
in 1940. He felt that the horror 
of nuclear weapons is completely 
obscured by that of chemical and 
biological warfare.
On a capitalist society. Bishop 
Nichols stated that this system 
has proven itself, in the American
example, as the most powerful in 
the world. Simultaneously, it rep­
resents the fullest expression of 
Western civilization. Capitalism 
now stands in a competitive posi­
tion in the world, and the issues 
that we are now facing are all 
manifestations of the problem of 
whether capitalism can expand its 
distributional process so that all 
its clients are served. Monetary 
reparations to the black commun­
ity would only have shock value, 
and not solve any of the underly­
ing problems. Bishop Nichols 
warned, however, that if capital­
ism does not serve all the people 
that all little ripples it so creates 
eventually shake it down.
Black separatism was seen as 
a fantasy, rendered impossible by 
economic actuality. Bishop Nich­
ols felt that separatism would 
lead to the establishment of what 
would be little more than reserva­
tions for blacks.
In conclusion. Bishop Nichols 
told the audience that to solve our 
problems, short of war, society 
must maintain a moral and spir­
itual basis. Without a clear value 
system there can be no concept of
family or interpersonal feeling. 
Hitler had to sweep aside Chris­
tianity and invoke a paganism be­
fore he could proceed to attemp to 
conquer the world. It was warned 
that before we discard present 
values that we better develop a 
substitute. The vacuum left by do­
ing away with the old can lead to 
a vacuous type of human being
QED To Run
The personal vision of William
F. Buckley, Jr., is seen on NET 
Journal and aired on WQED Mon­
day, Nov. 3, at 9 p.m. The color 
program is repeated Sunday. 
Nov. 9, at 5 p.m.
Mr. Buckley has been called a 
renaissance man of American con­
servatism. He is an editor (Na­
tional Review), a syndicated col­
umnist (“On the Right”), a host 
of his own television program 
(Firing Line) and a political gad­
fly (he ran for mayor of New York 
City in 1965».
This program is a series of 
film statements reflecting Buck­
ley’s concerns and perceptions
who might become an easy victim 
of the “strongest voice.”
One questioner told the audi­
ence that he doubted that capital­
ism was prepared to serve all its 
clients. Bishop Nichols responded 
that both socialist and capitalist 
systems must include elements 
each other in order to survive.
Wm. Buckley
about life in America today. The 
areas include crime and violence, 
communism, capital punishment, 
patriotism, the arts, the ghetto 
and its evolving leadership, and 
the beauty of unspoiled America. 
His remarks — whether from a 
podium at Rice University or in a 
private discussion with Whitney 
Young of the Urban League—are 
urbane, analytical, often biting.

March Against Death,
The most significant anti-war demonstration in American history 
will take place Nov. 15 in Washington, D. C. The march is being organ­
ized by the New Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam.
A major feature of the November demonstrations will be a March 
Against Death through Washington, starting at midnight on Nov. 13 
and continuing for 36 hours through Nov. 14, and into the morning of 
Nov. 15. This March Against Death will be a single file solemn proces­
sion of an expected 43,000 to 45,- 
000 persons (a number from each 
state approximately equivalent to 
the number of Americans from 
each state who have been killed in 
Vietnam) moving past the White 
House.
Each marcher will carry the 
name of one American who has 
died. That name will be called out 
by him as he passes a given point 
in front of the White House. In ad, 
dition, the names of Vietnamese 
towns which have been bulldozed, 
bombed, or burned out of exis­
tence by U.S. forces in Vietnam 
will be carried and read out.
The March Against Death will 
begin at Arlington National Cem­
etery and end at the Capitol where 
the name placards of those who 
have died will be placed in caskets 
and later carried to the White 
House gate.
This project, the committee 
says, “Will draw together the re­
sources, the protest and the resis­
tance which already have been 
expressed in many readings of 
the names across the country in a 
single massive national action 
which will both mourn and pro­
test the meaningless slaughter 
and demand that the killing be 
stopped.”

Students Make Plans To Attend Moratorium
We want 1.000 from C-MU to 
go to Washington for the Novem­
ber March,” said John Agatston 
at meeting Monday night to dis­
cuss future plans for the Moratori­
um. “We ll take care of anyone 
who wants to go. Just tell anyone 
who can’t afford it to come to our 
next meeting. We’ll get the money 
from somewhere,” he continued.
The meeting, attended by ap­
proximately 50 students and a 
handful of faculty, began with an 
[appraisal of the Oct. 15 demon­
strations. All agreed that the na­
tionwide effort was a fantastic 
success.
The spirit was great,” said 
one student. “But we should have 
ad more signs. We must show 
them we are not of the old apathe­
tic C-MU. Let’s carry signs in 
Washington ‘C-MU Against the 
War.’”
Another student chimed in that 
we should carry signs declaring,
‘ Vietnam—Love It or Leave It.”
“Maybe we could all carry slide 
rules to display our identify,” 
omeone added.
One student mentioned the prob­
lem of students who were in sym­
pathy with the moratorium but 
who did not attend or march be­
cause they felt compelled to at­
tend classes. He continued that 
the committee should make an ef­
fort to reach these people and 
show them how important a part 
of their education the Moratori­
um is.
“Engineers insisted that class­
es be cancelled,” a student re­
marked. “And if engineers can do 
it, anybody can.”
The purpose of the meeting, to 
discuss future plans, took up most 
of the time. Of course, the March 
| Against Death in Washington is 
the focal point of all preliminary 
activities.
John Agatston reported that 
buses will leave from C-MU Sat­
urday morning at 5 or 6 a.m. He 
distributed lists for those who 
want rides or can give others lifts 
either for the Saturday march or 
the March of the Dead to sign up. 
He urged that these lists be dis- 
tributed around campus so that 
I everyone who wants to. can at­
tend. The cost of the bus trip will 
* be approximately $11.
In order to pay for transporta­
tion for those who cannot afford 
to go to Washington, several 
C-MU students will be making 
silk-screened posters to sell to 
people in the city. Other revenue 
will be collected from selling but­
tons, arm bands, etc.
I Canvassing the city, talking 
with residents, was suggested by 
several students. Some felt that 
we were not well enough qualified 
to try to convince people to sup­
port the Moratorium. Others felt 
that the middleclass voter, “the 
ones who elected Nixon,” were

the most important people to try 
to convince and that every effort 
should be made to do so.
A former Pittsburgh high 
school student, turned C-MU 
freshman, suggested that the com­
mittee try to arrange talks in 
small seminars as well as assem­
blies in the local and suburban 
schools. Many agreed that this 
was a viable suggestion.
Agatston reported that the 
Friends had received many re­
quests for information from high 
school organizations who desired 
to demonstrate Oct. 15.
“Wait till 19-year-olds begin to 
get drafted. Then they really are 
going to need our help counseling 
and explaining,” a student com­
mented.
Weekly meetings to talk about 
the war and to learn about its his­
tory were thought to be a good 
idea by many in attendance.
In addition, the literature table 
in Skibo will be continued.
Some students also suggested 
that recruiters who have military 
contracts be pressured to move 
off campus. Another student sug­
gested that a list be prepared and 
distributed to seniors enumerat­
ing each company’s affiliations.
“Maybe we should just go into 
these interviews and talk with the 
recruiters and tell them what we 
don’t like,” a student commented.
The committee will continue to 
discuss these, and other, sugges­
tions next Monday night at 7, 
Room 45, Skibo.
The lampyridae beetle family. 
Delight of small boys. Biological 
light bulb. And prime source of 
raw material for another Du Pont 
innovation.
Luciferase, an enzymatic protein 
with intriguing properties, obtain­
able only from fireflies. Luciferin, 
an organic molecule also found in 
fireflies, but synthesizable. Adeno­
sine triphosphate (ATP), a common 
energy-yielding substance found in 
all living cells.
Those are the three main ingre­
dients in lampyridae's love light. 
And because ATP is common to all 
living cells, university researchers 
discovered they could produce an
artificial glow by mixing luciferin 
and luciferase wherever life is 
present.
Noting that phenomenon, Du Pont 
scientists and engineers went on 
to develop it into a practical ana­
lytical system. Correlating the in­
tensity of the artificial “glow" with 
the amount of ATP present in 
bacteria, they designed a means of 
measuring the reaction.
The result is the luminescence 
biometer—the first really basic im­
provement in bacteria-counting 
methods since the time of Louis 
Pasteur. Rather than waiting days 
for a culture to demonstrate growth 
density, a doctor or technician can
now get a digital readout of bacteria 
concentration in a matter of minutes.
Other potentially lifesaving uses 
for the biometer are being sug­
gested every day—such as diagnos­
ing metabolic rates, enzyme de­
ficiencies and nerve damage.
Innovation—applying the known 
to discover the unknown, inventing 
new materials and putting them to 
work, using research and engineer­
ing to create the ideas and products 
of the future—this is the venture 
Du Pont people are engaged in.

Women's Field Hockey Team 
Closes Season At 5-2-1
Last Tuesday the C-MU wom­
en's field hockey team closed out 
their 1969 season. The eight 
game schedule included contests 
with Pitt, Bethany, Waynesburg 
(two), and Wheeling (two). At the 
conclusion the record stood at five 
wins, two losses and one tie.
This successful year can be at­
tributed to two main reasons. 
First, is the return of many play­
ers from last years’ squad. A sol­
id core in both the defense and of­
fense was of great value in get­
ting the season started. This also 
gave the C-MU team experience 
which was a prime factor in many 
of the wins. Another reason was 
the new player turnout. Many key 
position vacated by seniors were 
filled ablely by first year play­
ers.
The successes of the season 
were due to/the continual drive of
the offense and solid defense. The 
offense was led by Nancy Chand­
ler who topped the scoring list 
again this year with 15 goals. 
Others who scored this year were 
Linda Hood (two), Kathy Ander­
son (one), Mary Bookwalter 
(ones, Meg Watson (one), and Ei­
leen Spaulding (one). Linda Hood 
headed the defensive element of 
the team which limited the oppos­
ing teams to a total of seven goals 
during the season. The two losses 
came at the hands of Pitt and 
Bethany. The following is the field 
hockey record :

Tomorrow, the Tartans will 
seek their third straight Home­
coming victory when they square 
off against Franklin and Mar­
shall’s Diplomats at 1:30 p.m.
F&M who posted a 6-2 record 
last year, lost a 7-6 contest to the 
Tartans when the Diplomats miss­
ed the conversion attempt.
This year only four starters 
have returned for the Diplomats 
and they have lost three of their 
first four games. Their first 
string quarterback, Sam Long, 
played defenisve halfback for the 
past two years. Long suffered an­
kle and knee injuries in the game 
two weeks ago. If he is unable to 
play full time, sophomore Larry 
Shadek will fill in for him.
The Diplomats offense relies 
primarily on the ground game; in 
fact, they run three out of every 
four offensive plays. Their second 
leading rusher, John Brunetti, suf­
fered a shoulder injury two weeks 
ago but may play tomorrow. Their 
defensive line has limited oppon­
ents to less than one yard per car­
ry but they have been passed 
against with much success — a 
strategy the Tartans should be 
well aware of going into this game.
Last Saturday, Franklin & Mar­
shall dropped a 28-0 decision to 
Dickinson. Their offense gained 
two yards rushing and 15 yards 
passing as the Diplomats were 
shut out for the first time in 21 
games.
The burden of the F&M attack 
will fall on halfback Barry Nemir­
off (25), and ends, Kevin Coulter 
(41) and Rusty O’Brien (89). De­
fensive standouts for the Diplo­
mats include senior end Maynard 
Little and junior linebacker Dick

team is 4-2-1 thus far and is going for its fifth victory against Grove 
City tomorrow at 10:30 a.m.
The C-MU soccer team hopes to improve on its 4-2-1 record in a 
10:30 a.m. contest at the Tech Bowl tomorrow against Grove City. In 
the Tartans’ first season of varsity status last year, the team lost a 
match at Grove City’s home field. The Wolverine team is strong this 
year as usual and is one of the most formidable opponents on C-MU’s 
schedule this year. If the Tech booters play together as they have done 
in the past, they have a good chance of winning Saturday’s game.
Last week’s 3-0 victory over 
Marietta once again displayed an 
aggressive defense coupled with 
a strong defense. Co-captain Hen­
rik Palme scored two second- 
quarter goals and that was all the 
defense, led by Co-captain Jake 
Eisenman, needed to sew up the 
win.
Coach Krotee’s team has come 
a long way since the beginning of 
the season, developing from a 
group of 30 individuals into a unit. 
Last season, the trial team com­
piled a 5-3 record so this year’s 
schedule was expanded and made 
more difficult.
Henrik Palme has scored the 
incredible total of 14 goals in the
seven games to lead all scorers. 
The Tartans as a team have scor- 
ed 23 goals while giving up only 
16. In fact in the last three games 
against strong opponents such as 
Indiana State, Slippery Rock and 
Marietta, the defense has given 
up only two goals. Sophomore 
Jacques Borisewitz has done an 
outstanding job in his second year 
at netminder.
Following Saturday’s game, the 
soccer team has two matches re­
maining. Both are at 10:30 a.m. 
at the Tech Bowl and will be 
against Pitt-Johnstown on Nov. 1 
and Pitt on Nov. 8.
