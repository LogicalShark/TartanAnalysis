Sororities 
Pledge 66
Formal Rushing Ends 
With Ballot Check
Tuesday, October 16, at 5:00 was 
an important moment for the sor­
ority girls on campus. This hour 
officially ended formal rushing 
for the eligible rushees.
Monday morning, October 15, 
began the complicated procedure 
of matching the rushee’s choice 
with that of the sorority. At 10 
o’clock the sororities submitted a 
list of the girls they wanted to 
bid. An half hour later the rushees 
marked their ballots with as many 
as three preferences.
Finished Tuesday
By 5 o’clock the Dean of Women 
and representatives of Pittsburgh 
Pan Hellenic Association matched 
the ballots and returned the re­
sults to the sororities. Invitations 
were available for the chosen girls 
Tuesday morning after 10:30, and 
their response was received by the 
sorority at 5:00 Tuesday afternoon.

New Election 
Necessary 
For Freshmen
Re-elections for freshman class 
president will be held on Tues­
day, October 30, at 11:30. Cam­
paigning will be permitted dur­
ing the two full school days pre­
ceding the elections, Friday and 
Monday.
No posters larged than 11 inches 
by 14 inches will be allowed. Any 
other active campaigning is per­
mitted.
The re-elections are necessary 
because of a discrepancy in vot­
ing. Some freshmen voted twice, 
using both the original cards and 
the, new identification cards.
Carnegie Deficit 
Laid To Inflation, 
Lower Enrollment
Providing a sharp insight into 
Carnegie’s 1951 - 1952 financial 
problems, President Warner, has 
revealed that estimated income 
falls $285,000 short of meeting 
budgeted expenses. This compares 
with a $205,000 difference last 
year.
He said the larger gap—$80,000 
—to current inflation.
“If inflationary pressures con­
tinue to grow, our problem will 
be intensified,” he declared.
The difference of $205,000 be­
tween estimated income and out­
lay in 1950-1951 was further 
heightened by belowr-normal en­
rollment, Dr. Warner explained. 
“But this was offset by certain 
budget savings, by unexpected ex­
tra dividends on endowment in­
vestments, by gifts and grants 
that could be applied to the 
budget, and by money drawn from 
a reserve fund previously unear­
marked."
However, some of these sources 
may not always be available, he 
added.
He said, “We hope Carnegie will 
be able to obtain gifts and grants 
from industry, alumni and friends 
adequate to bridge the gap be­
tween regular income and the ex­
pense budget needed to maintain 
th highest quality In our educa­
tional and research programs.”

Day opportunity to present a 
twenty-five dollar award to the 
outstanding freshman of last year 
in the college of Engineering &

Superior Airpower Necessary, 
Homecoming Speaker Warns
Major Genera] Putt Tells Alumni Audience 
Of Need For Increased Research, Production
Warning that Russia’s airpower is superior in quantity to the 
airpower of all the free nations combined, Major General Donald L. 
Putt, acting deputy chief of staff in charges of Air Force development, 
declared Saturday that freedom of the air hinges on IA S. ability
to obtain superiority in quality of*-------------------------------------------—-----
airpower.
Speaking at the alumni Home-engineer versus engineer—campus 
versus campus. For the struggle—coming luncheon, he laid the . _ .problem squarely in the lap of, Russia and in America
America’s universities, stating:
“The stakes were never higher, 
the issues never clearer. Freedom 
of the air hangs in the balance.
And the balances of world power 
leads straight to the American ^e'^. 
campus. This is the challenge—
ters in the university, the key to 
scientific knowledge.”
Time No Help 
Time is no longer on the side 
of the U. S., he warned, but on
the greatest challenge of the cen­
tury.'’
Ability To Communicate
He defined freedom of the air 
as “our ability to communicate 
freely with the people of all na­
tions” and explained how Russia 
“has built her aggressive dicta­
torship behind closed doors and 
under airspace.” Russia controls 
the airspace above fully one- 
third of the earth, he pointed out, 
and has isolated her people from 
a true understanding of world 
conditions, creating a continual 
threat of all-out war and a major 
barrier to all-out peace.
“The underlying issue of the 
day is isolation of the air versus 
freedom of the air.”
“The challenge of tomorrow is 
being met today in our laborator­
ies,” he asserted. “This conflict 
pits physicist versus physicist—
MMCC Seminar 
Room Is Named 
For Professor
A new MMCC seminar room was 
named in honor of Professor Har­
old L. Lang who is head of CIT’s 
Department of General Science. 
The room was dedicated at 10:30 
Saturday morning during Home­
coming.
The Lang Seminar Room will be 
used for senior seminar talks and 
as a special science study room. 
It was made possible through a 
gift of Mr. and Mrs. Alfred S. An­
drews of Cleveland, 'Ohio, both 
1928 graduates of Carnegie.
Mrs. Edith Alexander, dean of 
Margaret Morrison, was on hand 
to greet the alumni, faculty, and 
present science students. Main 
speaker at the affair was presi­
dent J. C. Warner.
One of the first graduates of the 
science department, Marguerite 
Spilman, told of the founding of 
the department in Margaret Mor­
rison.
he indicated, “can choose the mo­
ment and place to strike—we will 
never take the first step,” There­
fore, he said, this country cannot 
afford to let its technological dis­
coveries “sit on the shelf.”
He outlined an Air Force pro­
gram of 1,098 university-operated 
research and development projects 
set up to actively improve U. S. 
quality of airpower. By July 1952, 
these development contracts will 
total 100 million dollars, he esti­
mated.
The task of achieving superior 
quality of airpower could at one 
time be plotted by military men, 
but that time has long passed, he 
declared. “In World War II we 
measured our firepower in terms 
of bullets. Tomorow it must be 
measured in electro-magnetic 
waves. We are now engaged in a 
battle for electronic command of 
the air.”
Four Objectives
He cited freedom from human 
frailty as one of four long-range 
objectives of the U. S. Air Force. 
Others, he said, are freedom from 
want and waste, freedom from 
enemy interference, and freedom 
from natural limitations of flight.
General Putt, who commanded 
the Hermann Goering Aeronauti­
cal Research Establishment— 
“Wright Field” of Germany—in 
1945, 'received a distinguished 
achievement award at the alumni 
luncheon. A 1928 Carnegie grad­
uate, he is the second to receive 
it.
Created last year, the first 
award went to Charles E. Wilson, 
General Motors president, who 
graduated from Carnegie in 1909.
Stray Greeks
Stray Greeks are to sign up 
in Dean of Women’s office by 
October 26 so that they can re­
ceive invitations for the Pan- 
hellenic formal dance on No­
vember 10.

’ Confident Running and Passing, Aggressive 
Lineplay Mark Third Straight Plaid Victory
Plaid Lineman 
Of The Week
Tartan vote for lineman of the 
week goes this week to right end 
Tom Claig. Both a hard hitting 
blocker and an able pass catcher, 
Craig shone in the Allegheny 
game Saturday, catching a pass for 
the first touchdown and throwing 
key blocks which led to others. 
In addition to his blocking and 
pass-shagging, Craig’s punting 
ability has proved especially val­
uable to the Plaid during Captain 
Arne Oberg’s injury absence.
Craig, who is a junior in Me­
chanical Engineering and hails 
from East McKeesport, Pa., is 
playing his first season of inter­
collegiate football. Both a football 
and basketball letterman in high 
school, Craig devoted his first two 
years at Carnegie to varsity 
basketball under coach Mel Crats- 
ley before reporting for football 
this fall.
Winner of last week’s Tartan 
football contest was Jim Makris, 
sophomore metallurgist. Jim 
slipped up on two of Saturday’s 
games, but called the other eight 
correctly.
Another contestant, Frank Car­
ter, also got eight right, but was 
edged by Makris when it came to 
predicting game scores.

determined team from Allegheny 
by a 39-0 score.
Twenty of the Carnegie pointers 
came in the second quarter as the 
Plaid put the game on ice quickly 
and then played under wraps for 
the remaining periods. In the sec­
ond half, reserves tallied two ad­
ditional TD’s to run the score to 
39 for the Scots.
Aggressive lineplay and a con­
fident running and passing attack 
featured the third straight Tartan 
win and their third in four games 
for the half-completed season. 
Skibo blocking was especially im­
proved as it held the Gator ground 
attack to 70 yards while springing 
the Tartan backs loose for a total 
of 283.
Pass Defense Improved
Pass defense, hitherto a major 
weakness in the Plaid game, 
showed signs of improvement in 
the Gator game as the Hilltoppers 
were held to only 71 yards through 
the air. The Scot aerial attack 
rolled on as it amassed 248 yards 
and tallied three of the day’s six 
touchdowns.
The Gators of Allegheny made

of the game as they stopped cold * 
on the two yard line a Tartan 
drive which had begun with the 
initial kickoff. The Skibos were 
not to be denied, however, and on 
possessing the pigskin again struck 
swiftly for their first score.
Taking an Allegheny punt on 
the midstripe, Carnegie scored in 
exactly two plays. After Irv 
Shechter had skipped around the 
Hilltopper left end to the 24, Quent 
Holtz connected on a long pass to 
Tom Craig in the end zone for the 
first TD.
Three Quick Onei 
The second quarter began like 
the first as the Gators again stop­
ped a Tartan drive, this time on 
the six-inch line. However, the 
roof then fell in on Allegheny as 
the Skibos scored three quick 
touchdowns.
The first came as a result of Al­
legheny’s forced punt from their 
own end zone. Receiving the ball 
on the 35, the Tartans scored three 
plays later on a long pass from 
Holtz to Arne Oberg.
The second of the three touch­
downs came with as astonishing 
rapidity as the first. Seemingly 
bogged down on their own 45 as a 
result of a 15 yard penalty, the 
Scots scored again on a long pass. 
Holtz connected with Fritz Wilson 
all alone behind the Gator sec­
ondary and Wilson trotted over 
for the six-pointer.
26-0 at Half 
The last touchdown of the first 
half came on the prettiest run of 
the day. On the first play after 
Eddie Miller had run a Hilltopper 
punt back to the Allegheny 45, 
Arne Oberg went around left end, 
picked up beautiful downfield 
blocking and evaded a host of Al­
legheny tacklers to make the in­
termission score 26-0 for the Plaid.
In the second half two more 
touchdowns were added for the 
Skibos on plunges by fullbacks Gil 
Dissen and Don Skillin. Most of 
the first string saw little action as 
Dr. Baker saved his regulars as 
much as possible for this Satur­
day’s game with Case Tech.

iou have to get up early in the morning to 
put one over on this cock-of-the-walk! When it 
came to making “quick-trick” experiments of 
cigarette mildness, he stated flatly, “That’s strictly 
for clucks”! How ’ya going to keep ’em down 
on the farm—when they know there’s one 
convincing way to prove cigarette mildness!
It’s the sensible test ... the 30-day Camel 
Mildness Test, which simply asks you to try 
Camels as a steady smoke—on a day after day 
basis. No snap judgments. Once you’ve enjoyed 
Camels for 30 days in your “T-Zone” (T for 
Throat, T for Taste), you’ll see why .. •
