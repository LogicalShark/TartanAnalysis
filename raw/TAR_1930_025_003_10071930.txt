Mainstays of- Thiel’s 
Plucky Eleven
A well-fed score of 52-6 verifies 
.the complete knockout scored by 
Carnegie's powerful gridiron eleven 
over a hard fighting team from 
Thiel Collcgc. Everyone who wit­
nessed . the struggle will agree that 
the Tartans possess ability that will 
weigh heavy in their strive for na­
tional honors. Their performance on 
Saturday brought to mind the tip­
top combination of 1928.
The Lutheran brothers had ' no 
right to go away mad, even though 
the Tartan engineers did leave some 
bluc-prints on their countenance, for 
at times they put forth daring aerial 
attacks which netted yardage in a 
wholesale basis. To .be exact, the 
total amounted to 232 yards. Thiel 
went down to a glorious defeat, and 
fought stubbornly to the final 
whistle.
Eyth Stars
¦This game received the personal 
” ition of none other than Iioward 
£yth, of the industrial educators, 
the first three periods Dutch 
the essence of the attack, male- 
three brilliant runs averaging 43 
s at a time. With good inter­
nee, the diminutive half was 
gglcd through tlie line and when 
to his own resources proved to 
in ellusive flash. The ¦line made 
holes and Dutch picked them, 
rmentrout, ICarcis and Rosenx.weig 
•tinted for consistent, gains.® On 
:\v ..occasions the “Big Cbu-chu” 
away from the angry mob to 
'jilacjj the ball in a more advantage- 
rA15-;posj;tion. Karcis,..rivaling' his 192S 
form, ran the ball over several of 
the (visitors and added' many yards 
.before he was brought to a 'crilnpletc 
rest. Big John pulled a surprise 
when he intcrsccpted a pass and 
traveled some twenty odd or even 
yards with it. Ted ROsehzweig sup­
ported the winnings with his tricks 
behind the line. Quite frequently 
he} hit the Thiel element for a gain.
The Thiel aggregation is fortunate 
iiv.' having such a combination as 
Wardle, Myers, and Schcmick. They 
art enough to upset the dope against 
aiiy good team. Wardle, at quarter, 
directed his team well and was the 
origin of nearly all the 17 passes com­
pleted by the visitors. It was^ near 
the close of the third period that lie 
retreated 15 yards to ’le-avd \a-' bullet 
pass to Schcmick who •.jumped high 
in the air and brought the .oval'safe­
ly. to earth for the, lone touchdown; 
But this was only oiic of Schmick’s 
good catches,, for lie proceeded with 
Mjvers to be on the receiving end of 
a dozen more passes.

“HUMAN NATURE”, NEW 
BOOK BY DR. SCHOEN, 
IS USED EXTENSIVELY
First Year Psychology 
Book Adopted By 
80 Colleges
Published only in -May,' "Human 
Nature,” a first book in psychology, 
written " by Dr. Max Schocn of 
Carnegie, has been welcomed with 
unusual enthusiasm by teachers of 
psychology throughout the country. 
The book has been adopted by over 
eighty colleges. Among them are 
Boston University, Carnegie, Mount 
Holyoke College, New York Uni­
versity, Ohio Wesleyan University 
and Tuskcgce Institute.
“Human Nature” brings to tlie field 
of psychology instruction a new 
method of supjpct presentation. . It 
tics the student’s thinking up with 
the impressions of an actually func­
tioning human being, giving him hot 
only the theory but the application 
to his daily life as well. Besides 
this interesting and attractive man­
ner of presentation,' Dr. Schocn's 
skillful harmonizing of opposing 
schools and points' of view has 
brought forth much favorable com­
ment.
Another Edition in January
Another edition of “Human Na­
ture” for the general public is to 
be printed in January, 1931. The ex­
ceptional adaption of this book to 
beginning students makes it suitable 
for general readirig.
Favorable notices have been given 
to Dr. Schocn’s book:
"It is the most ‘human’ of all the 
texts I know of. I like its eclecticism, 
its simple, dear, and lucid style,'its 
readableness, its masterly grasp of 
significant facts- and principles, and 
its - directness of exposition. I also 
admire the. literary craftmanship of' 
the author. I shall certainly ..adopt 
it: for- my courses.”—E. Y. Mclckian, 
Battle Creak. .College.
“It’ should make a very readable 
text for a'first course in psychology. 
In reading this text a student will 
certainly realize that the subject of 
psychology is not something off in

GOV’T. TO PURCHASE 
R. O. T. C. UNIFORMS
•• The Military Department of Car­
negie Tech has adopted a new 
policy with respect to uniforms for 
the juniors. This- year their uni­
forms will be purchased with the 
$30 which the Federal Government 
allows the school-for each man in 
the Junior- Class, ROTC. The 
junior’s uniform will consist of an 
officer’s regulation hat, blouse, and 
long trousers, made to order from 
wbip-cord material. The uniform 
will be given to the student to 
keep, provided he remains in school 
throughout his junior year; other­
wise. .the., uniform reverts to the 
school. ,
In previous years, it has been the 
policy to purchase school uniforms 
for the Juniors, but these uniforms 
were then passed on to the sopho­
mores;, and. plebes, .when the stu­
dents purchased their officer’s, uni­
forms in their senior year. In 
their senior year,, the students will 
be expected to purchase boots, 
breeches, Sarri. Brown belt/ saber, 
spurs,- ornaments, etc.; thus ^giving 
them complete officer’s uniforms. 
An allowance of $10 is made by 
the government for each man en­
rolled in Senior ROTC. The stu­
dents will receive this amount to 
help them purchase the necessary 
articles of dress. However, as this 
amount is insufficient to cover the 
entire cost, the students must pay 
the deficit themselves.
This new policy means a gain of 
$30 to students who take the ad­
vanced course in ROTC.
Engineers Use Riggs’
New Mechanics Text
A new “Applied Mechanics” 
book has been written by Norman 
C. Riggs, professor of mechanics 
of Carnegie Tech. This, book is 
the outgrowth of the mechanics 
course which has been given to the 
engineering Students of this’ insti­
tution, and it has become one of 
the popular volumes of the En­
gineering,Science Scries. Professor 
Riggs was assisted by Prof. M. M. 
Frocht and J. J. Stoker.
The motive in writing this book, 
which is to be used as the stand­
ard text this semester, is to develop 
the course from fundamental prin­
ciples, and to train the student to 
reason logically the behavior of 
materials with which he will work 
in his engineering career.
Y.W.C.A. TO HOLD BIG 
AND LITTLE SISTER TEA 
ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON
The Y. W. C. A. will hold a Big 
and Little Sister tea on Friday, Octo­
ber 10, from 4:30 to 6 o’clock in the 
Recreation hall of Margaret Mor­
rison. Miss Mary Watson Green, 
Dean of Women, will pour tea. All 
freshmen and juniors of both Mar­
garet Morrison and Arts school are 
invited. If any freshman does not 
have a “big sister,” she should re­
port to Betty Goodwin. Floy Sample, 
a junior in Margaret Morris.on, is 
chairman of the ' entertainment com­
mittee. Doris Mather, senior secre­
tarial, will put on a stunt, and 
Zarelda Mazza, a Junior in Mar­
garet Morrison, will give a recitation. 
Dancing will follow. •
On Monday evening, Octobcr 13, 
the Y. W. C. A. cabinet will hold 
a candle light service dinner for 
the freshman class. The freshmen arc 
asked to dress in white and to

garet Morrison at 5 o’clock. Imogcne 
Sciiory, president of the Y., will 
light a candle and each freshman 
will light one from hers. Miss 
Schory will lead the profession up 
the stairs, of Margaret Morrison into 
the Recreational hall, where a de­
licious dinner will' be served. Sally 
Beatty is chairman’ of the dinner,

hold a joint banquet at the Carnegie 
Commons on Octobcr 21. Floy 
Sample is Y. W. chairman of the 
drive. The speaker for the evening 
has not been selected as yet.
DR. ALEXANDER RETURNS 
TO STAFF FROM YEAR’S 
LEAVE OF ABSENCE
Dr. Alexander'of the Chemistry 
department has returned to Car^ 
negie after spending a year’s leave, 
of absence in Europe, where lie as­
sisted Dr. G: M. Schwab of Munich 
University in research with the 
Catalytic Increment of Methane on 
Ozone Decomposition.5 ,'i'his is one 
of the many important links in the 
general field of reactions.
Dr.Alexander brought back many 
interesting ideas of university life 
from his'visit’s to important schools 
in Germany, Italy, Austria and 
Switzerland. German universities 
and students impressed Dr. Alex­
ander by their radical diffcrcncc 
from American institutions. The 
German student does not have 
classes. He merely attends, or as 
Americans .would say, is exposed to 
a series of lectures covering the- 
particular subject that lie is inter­
ested in. At-the.end of the semes­
ter or year, the student goes before 
a governing body: and is examined. 
If lie passes this examination all is 
well and good, if not, it simply 
means repeat the course.
This obvious lack of recitation 
and supervision ¦ 'from instructors 
makes is necessary for the German 
student to take his college career 
very seriously. His life at the uni­
versity is entirely void of com­
petitive sport, and is extremely 
weak in social activities, which are 
confined to student clubs that cor­
respond in a slight extent to the 
American fraternities. Members of 
these clubs wear some character­
istic piece of personal attire, such 
as a cap or an entire uniform. The 
universities themselves are in most 
cases verypoorly housed and 
equipped. Munich University, where 
Dr. Alexander spent- most of his 
time, is.now planning a new- build­
ing, which is endowed by the well 
known Rockefeller Foundation of 
the United States. This building 
will be- used by the chemistry de­
partment and will greatly relieve 
the congestion no,w prevailing at 
the university.
Teknon Club Will Hold 
Election Of Officers 
To Fill Vacancies
Three of the offices of the Tek­
non Club, an organization of the 
Shadyside Presbyterian Church for 
Carnegie student's, are now un­
occupied, two of the vacancies be­
ing due to the functioning of the 
women’s activities point system, 
and one,to a departure.from school.
Ann Dickenson and . Katherine 
Palen would now be vice president 
and secretary respectively, were it 
not for the rule which keeps any 
wdman from holding more than a 
prescribed amount of offices. Fran­
cis Walters, the president-elect, has 
not returned to school this year, 
leaving V. .McBride, treasurer, as 
the only remaining officer. A 
nominating committee has been ap­
pointed and the election of officers 
will be held October 9.
The club is a s'ociety for the 
discussion of moral and religious 
problems facing the college -stu­
dent. Rev. Hugh Thompson Kerr, 
(Continued on Page Four)
Prof. Alexander, Back;From Germany,
Gives German’s impressions of America
Our social theory that accepts 
young people at their own merit 
and our woeful lack of servants 
are the first, impressions made upon 
a . visitor from Germany. At least, 
so we learn from Dr. Alexander, 
associate professor of chemistry at 
Carnegie, when he retold a German 
scientist’s first- impressions of this 
country, gathered during a six- 
month’s slay.
We áre thankful that lie does not 
offer the usual trite and caustic 
comments on the length of our 
women’s skirts and the shortness 
of their manners. Instead, he was 
impressed1 by things that arc as 
commonplace to us as news that 
Johnny so-and-so has sat, or hand- 
shaked, or .toddled a new world’s 
record. The spirit of all-pervading 
democracy impressed him most 
forcefully, and lie had great diffi­
culty in accustoming himself to the 
“clicrip,. old scout!” type of civilisa­
tion that is so characteristic. Our 
youth, unhampered by conventions 
or pride,-often cheerfully perform 
the most menial of tasks in order 
that they may receive an education,
r gain their desires and aims. 
3er scientist couldn’t quite under­
stand the social theory that accepts 
these young people at their own 
merit, never causing them to lose 
caste' with their employer or the 
outside world as a result of their 
labors.. Perhaps it would be more 
comprehensible Lo him if he knew 
that, in many cases, the employers 
themselves got their start doing 
the same type of work.
Formality is fast becoming an 
obsolete practice in this country, 
and the lack of it has been ob­
served by thp German, whose every 
action is politeness itself, conform­
ing to ponderous customs. The re­
lations between older and younger, 
between superiors and their subor­
dinates, arc quite genial—often re­
sulting from the fact that they play 
a similar brand of golf 1 Collcgc 
students have ready access to their 
profs, and often meet : and greet 
them in a most unceremonious fash­
ion.. They sit side by side with 
them at public gatherings, and, as 
often as not, address them by their

Limited Number of 
Copies This Year
The Athletic Association is mak­
ing extensive preparations for the 
third football dancc of the season 
to be. held bn Saturday evening, 
October 11, in the Union. This
dance will be the first to be held 
after a major football game this 
season, and the committee is an­
ticipating a' large • crowd. Bert
Weidcnhcimer and his , Sylvanians 
will furnish the rhythm for the
cycning. As usual, there will be 
dancing from 9 to. 12.
The committee expects some of 
Georgia Tech’s students and alumni 
to be present at the. affair. As has 
been the custom in the .past, all 
of the members of Carnegie Tech’s 
football team will be invited as 
guests of the Athletic Association. 
These dances afford the new stu­
dents of the school an opportunity 
to mingle among the football stars 
of the school, and to become bet­
ter acquainted * Avith their fellow 
students. Members of Carnegie 
Tech’s alumni arc also invited to 
enjoy the festivities.
The Thistle has established a 
new plan, Avhcrcby only the num­
ber of books ordered will be print­
ed. This avoids unnecessary delay, 
and consequently, there will be no 
books .left over for late subscribers.
The coming issue is already Avell 
tinder way, with the various groups 
busy on tiieir plans and write-ups. 
'i he theme,of the book emphasizes 
the beauty of the campus and stu­
dent activities to a degree unpre­
cedented in Thistle history. There 
will be a fine collection of. campus 
snapshots.. This year, however, all 
group pictures will be taken in the 
fall months only, instead of taking 
them during the fall and spring 
seasons, because in the past in­
clement weather frequently tnadc 
it impossible to take all the groups.
The departmental clubs and vari­
ous ' branches are asked to co­
operate, and be prompt, in order 
to expedite the speedy completion 
and delivery of the nccessary ma­
terial.
The Thistle for 1931 will be 
issued before the close of the pres­
ent school year,, and Avill. be on 
sale at a future date, which will be

Genius of engineering did it. But the 
power of dynamite was there. . .work­

Dynamite is the ally of the modern 
engineer. It is the 26d2 without which, 
carefully designed plans for many heroic 
undertakings would never be more than 
paper plans.
Skyscrapors. Tunnels through moun­
tains, under rivers and cities. Bridge« 
and highways. Dams and reservoirs. 
These . . . and numerous other . . . 
engineering marvels are built with the 
aid of dynamite. Dynamite digs into 
the earth and blasts out raw materials 
used in the milking of countless articles 
we use every day.
Dynamite is more than important to 
industry . . . it is necessary!

Jvc the information “Not want- 
, is. 1 will continue this twaddle,
| and fw,a(Mie along to the tune of 
an idle nig.::«, student.
First of all, .Registration—did you 
say Register at Night ? ‘Well, judging 
j from the number uf people who 
j were out the gate receipts must be 
| far in excess of those the previous 
| years. 1 hardly knew whether 1 was 1 coming or going. Every time you 
' conic out here to register they have 
established’' a new wrinkle to shoot 
j the works to you, and this one is 
about the best ever, '¦’.icy have my 
I OK for the_system. If 1 stood long 
enough in the line I believe I would 
\ conic out an Engineer, that-is, pro­
viding 1 entered as an Art Student.
First it was one thing, and then 
another, it seems to me they should 
* furnish, you with some sort of a 
| carry-all. to hold all the things which 
j were poked at you. Here you were 1 handed a card, over there, they took 
! something from you, and then again 
' you had to sign your name—how 
I niiiny times, J don’t know, but it 
I seems to me p there was three yards 
of flexible cardboard to sign. Com- 
I pie ting that you were told to go some 
other place to get this thing and 
: that thing approved, then you were 
passed through a hot roll, and then 
' a cold roll, and finally, landed at 
the most important placc, the Cash- 
jfcr’s ./Booth. Passing this lest you

I grey b ook, and an equally attractive 
I RED 1 book, these, by the way, were 
j given you free, and a hole punched

I have an idea, this is a Scotch Jn- 
I stitution. Why bother about another 
' ! holder. Use the one you had last 
I year. Some idea, hell! 
j After I was registered I tarried 
a bit to see what it looked like
from the other end, and some of the 
I remarks one heard were rather 
i amusing. For instance, "where do 
: we go from here,” reply—“go home 
and go to bed." “Is this all?” “When 
do we start." "Gee! I’m glad that 
is over, but I’ll never be the same.” 
"Can you tell me if my classes be-

a sigh of relief was heard, Looking

Darn these editors—they’re a pesky 
lot—all they seem to know is "hey

You’d think running a paper was

squawking about articles, and- then 
when you give the big bum one he 
tills it up with marginal notes, cross­
es out half of your good stuff and 
substitutes some junk that just isn’t 
worth reading. If he’s so darn good 
why don’t lie write his own in the 
first placc? Anyhow, while he’s out 
of the room, I’ll just sit' here and 
dash off the best article he ever saw.
Ob, boy! look iat the queen, and 
me with high blond pressure—wonder 
who she_ is? Oh Svell, I’ll get to 
know here before long, but just now 
I must' get busy and write that big 
editorial. Let’s see, for a starter— 
The Present Day Economic Condi­
tions in Russia arc in direct contrast 
to those of China before the Boxer 
Uprising, for instance. Ah heck, no­
body in this school is smart enough 
to appreciate anything so profound 
as that. (P. S. I couldn’t find the 
right references).

swell, idea for one. What, , go home, 
sure, as soon as 1 turn in my as­

As a Pocket Pen
Getting the Parker Duofold is now 
like getting two Pens at the price of one. 
Attaching a tapered end converts it into 
a Desk Set Pen. Removing the taper 
restores it to a pocket Pen.
Either way, you save the. price of a 
second pen. You have only one Pen to 
fill instead of two. And whether you 
write at your desk or on the go, you 
always have your favorite point.
You have a non-breakable Permanite 
barrel that holds 17.4% more ink than 
average, size for size—that is jewel-like 
in lustre, color, and beauty. And most 
of all — the famous Duofold *bonus 
point that writes with Geo. S. Parker’s 
47th improvement—Pressureless Touch.
ParLerD uofold
Same Pen Converted
Even at higher prices, other makers 
have been unable to match this classic. 
Now that it takes the place of a special , 
pen for the pocket and another for the 
desk, its sales are soaring beyond all 
previous heights.
Go and ask the nearest dealer to show 
how the Duofold is changed back and 
forth from a Pocket to a Desk Set Pen. 
If you own a Parker, take it with you. 
If not, go anyway and sec this revolu­
tionary invention.

? Point-smiths Paid a Bonus Eleven merciless inspections are given each Parker Duofold point. Then we pay a bonus to our point- smith who made it. Points are re­jected if they fail even one inspec­tion, and the point-smith pays us a forfeit. Yet, 7 out of 8^points earn a bonus, because we limit each man to a given number a day.
PEN GUARANTEED FOR LIFE
THE THRILL
lasts for days!
Those voices from Home will ring in 
your ears for days to come, and help 
to brighten up the longest lecture, 
or the dullest evening.
Make a telephone date with the folks 
at home, for a certain evening every 
week—and bring a touch of home 
to the campus.
It’s easy to make the call—just give 
the Operator your home telephone 
number, and stay on the line.
It costs but little—and, if you like, 
charges may be reversed.
SAFETY WEEK
With the advent of the annual 
meeting of the National Safety Com­
mittee, many establishments in the 
city have given a good portion of 
their advertising and show room 
space to exhibits of various safety 
devices and awards in the form of 
trophies that are awarded by many 
industrial concerns to employees or 
groups of employees that went 
through given periods of time with­
out' infringing on safety rules, or 
participating in any accidents.
This feature of awarding suitable 
departmental prizes for exceptional 
care in the performance of duty has 
stirred up no little competition among 
those who work in factories, mills 
or other hazardous places where a 
little care can avert most of the 
one-time frequent,'- and often fatal, 
accidents. The cynical one will re­
mark that it is strange that a man 
must be rewarded, or entertain the 
prospect of a reward, before he 
will take the necessary precautions to­
ward retaining his- health and lon­
gevity. This, however, is not the in­
tention of those who make the 
awards.
The principal ' idea is, that if there 
is some concrete evidence of ap­
preciation and notice of their efforts, 
the average group will take greater 
pains to gain honorable mention that 
they would for the mere pleasure 
of being able to tell others that 
they were exceptionally- careful. And, 
though this were the case, that re­
ward was nccessary to practicing 
care and caution, if the award has 
any effect at all towards reminding 
the workman that his safety depends 
wholly on himself to a great extent, 
although' the idea in itself is 
mercenary, it w’ould seem that the 
end justifies the means.
The deplorable number of prevent­
able accidents that yearly invalidj 
or destroy thousands of workmen in 
all parts of the world surely car­
ries enough horror with it to justify 
almost any steps that would be taken 
to make the public safety-minded, 
and this method of making the 
practicc of safe methods something 
of a game has shown such bene­
ficial results that no fault can rea­
sonably be found with the system. 
A. more gentle or subtle way of edu­
cating the public in taution can’ not 
be, formulated, for the mere enaction 
of shop rules . docs not necessarily 
imply that- these rules will be kept, 
whereas, by giving the men them­
selves a ,personal interest in ' the pre­
vention of accidents, many concerns 
have found that breakdowns, absences 
and similar holdups on the pro­
duction line. are largely done away 
with.
The exhibits themselves arc more 
than self-explanatory.. One finds that 
this safety movement has permeated 
more industrial pursuits that lie at 
first imagined. Railroads, steamship 
lines, power and light companies, 
steel manufacturers, airlines, bus­
lines, department stores, hospitals, 
these and many others branches of 
endeavor are all practicing and bene- 
. fitting by improved safety measures, 
and report that the gratifying co­
operation of their employees has 
done more to support the movement 
than any outlay of money for safe­
ty appliances. possibly • could.
Pittsburgh should be grateful for 
this very interesting and somewhat 
educational display that has been 
the outcome of the Convention, and 
after the displays arc removed, 
should remember that safety is not 
a one-week-a-year proposition, but a 
matter that concerns every one of 
us, day after day, Safety committees 
or no. With these thoughts in mind 
let’s all pull together to make our 
town a safer place in which to live.

THE WESTINGHOUSE 
MEMORIAL
A memorial to G;eorgc Westing- 
house was dedicated on Octobcr 6, 
in.Schenlcy Park. It is placed be­
neath the willows which droop 
over a small lily pond, just a short 
distance from the Gymnasium. 
The monument consists of three 
massive gold-leaf bronze panels 
placed in a sweeping arc upon a 
base of beautiful, black Norwe­
gian granite. The central, and 
largest panel ^ bears a. medallion of 
George Wcstinghousc; on each 
side of which arc full sized fig­
ures, one a ¿killed workman, the 
other an engineer. The entire 
panel is in full relief on both sides. 
The flanking wings arc divided in­
to small panels, each of which de­
picts a significant contribution 
which George Wcstinghousc made 
to modern industry. At a distance 
and facing the central panel is a 
heroic, sized figure of an American 
youth.
The monument is beautiful in 
its design and execution, and will 
well repay the visit of every, stu­
dent. Mr. Daniel Chester French 
modeled the central panel and the 
figure of the youth. Mr. Masail- 
icllo Piccirilli prepared the model 
and sculptured the ornament. Paul 
Fjelde executed the sinall histori­
cal panels. The-architect was Mr. 
H. Hornbostel, who also planned 
the buildings upon this campus. 
The funds were subscribed by 
some 54,000 members of the Wcst- 
inghouse industries as a lasting 
tribute to their founder.

night students 'for their co-operation.
PARKING REGULATIONS
These Parking Rules 
Must Be Strictly 
Observed
With the start of a new year the 
Plaid wishes at this time to stress 
the need of adhering to the regula­
tions for parking autos on and near 
the campus. The returning students 
arc apt to be a little., carclcss on 
this matter and the new student does 
not know that the observance of 
these rules is neccssary for the wel­
fare of the student body as a whole. 
These rules have been dccidbd upon 
to safeguard all concerned and all 
students are expected to abide by 
them.
No parking is permitted on the 
Industries side of Frew street, the 
roadway paralleling the Industries 
Building and Langley Lab. However, 
right angle parking is permitted on 
the Park side of this drive. Machines 
should be parked with the rear end 
to the embankment. They should also 
be parked reasonably close together 
so that as large a number as possible 
can be accommodated.
No parking is permitted on the 
Quadrangle, nor between, barriers on 
this drive at any time. This rule 
must be strictly observed.
No parking is permitted on tile 
drive between the Fine Arts build­
ing and Langley lab.
Parking is permitted on both sides 
of Woodlawn avenue, from Forbes 
street up to the intersection with 
Frew street at the Park drive. Drive­
ways and fire hydrants, however, must 
be kept clear.
There must be no parking 
Frew street hill running up to Park 
Mansions, ANY CAR FOUND 
PARKED ON THIS STREET 
WILL BE TOWED AWAY. Any 
car parked over the yellow lines at 
the intersection of Woodlawn ave­
nue, Frew street, and the Park drive 
WILL ALSO BE TOWED AWAY.
No parking is allowed in front of 
the barrier at Margaret Morrison.
It is our hope that the students 
who drive to school will co-operate 
with us and the police department 
so that it will not be neccssar3' to 
enforce more stringent regulations 
upon the connnutors.

Considering the fact that the aver­
age person forgets promptly any 
school work which they have no 
continuous need to remember, a timer 
ly suggestion of the Allegheny. Par- 
cnt-Teachcrs’ Association promises to 
givci the mcmlcrs of the organiza­
tion ; an opportunity to review their 
lolig forgotten lessons.
Subjects that were always consider­
ed essential arc to be stressed, 
especially English, History and 
Science. Many parents feel that it 
would be conducive to the advance­
ment of the children, if they would 
be able to give.them a little co-opera­
tion in their hoinc-woric, especially 
I in explaining certain points which proper steps taken to remedy them.
On June S Nu Sigtna Alpha 
initiated twenty night students who 
had previously been pledged. At the 
conclusion of the formal initiation, 
a dinner was served at the Cathedral 
Mansions to the ’newly initiated mem­
bers as well as the other members. 
Covers were laid for forty mem­
bers.

On July 19 a successful picnic was 
held at Mineral1 Beach on the Library- 
Finleyvillc road. Seventy-five mem­
bers and friends attended tile affair. 
The afternoon was exceedingly hot, 
and the swimming pool afforded a 
delightful relief from the intensive 
heat. In the'evening the baskets con­
taining the lunches were besieged and 
the contents devoured with avidity.
The last affair for the summer to 
be staged was a corn roast | which 
was held on September 20 at the 
North County Park. The day .was 
ideal for an affair of this kind and 
went over in a big way. Corn and 
weiners were in abundance, and the 
committee in charge ' of the affair 
is to be commended. '
is loath 
from an instructor, 
willing to accept 
from those dear 
people in whom we always trusted 
for iron-bound information.
If the plan works as expected, both 
parents and teachers would be bene­
fited by the results, for the teacher’s 
load would be considerably lightened 
by receiving pupils each day that 
were well prepared, and the parents 
would be gratified by the increasing­
ly., good grades the children . wotild 
receive.
Perhaps the idea has a sound basis, 
for, since'.the average child is per­
mitted to work out it's own destiny 
at school (with the ifdvent of free 
schools) the very novelty of the 
undertaking might attract a large 
number of .parents who have suf­
ficient interest in their • child's wel­
fare to be willing to shoulder part 
of the responsibility altqidcnt to 
their offspring’s education. Yet, on 
the other hand, if the advantages of 
education are regarded disinterested­
ly, now by > the parents, one really 
can’t cxpcct these same persons to 
take sufficient interest ¦ ill the pro­
gram to discommode themselves to 
the extent of attending classes. Still, 
the idea is new, and every new idea 
is full of weak spots, and with this 
iii mind, we can reasonably cxpcct 
that with the proper support the 
system might produce excellent re­
suits after a few months’ trial had 
exposed these weak features and
NEW LOCKER
ARRANGEMENT
A new arrangement has been put 
into cffcct in regard to the lockers. 
Heretofore the Institute placed at 
the disposal of the’students a locker 
upon the deposit of $1 for a key. 
This fee was returnable provided 
the key was surrendered at the close 
of the school year. This practicc 
has been discontinued starting with 
this year, and the following procedure 
obtains. .
The Institute will sell cadi stu­
dent a patented combination padlock 
for $1, and upon presenting the 
card and padlock which is issued 
to the loeker key room in the base­
ment of Administration Hall, the 
student will be assigned a loeker 
which is located as near as possible 
to his section. These padlocks will 
be sold at the book store in the base­
ment of Administration Hall. No 
lockers will be assigned unless the 
student purchases the padlock and 
securcs the assignment card. The 
Institute expects }rour co-operation 
in making this -new arrangement a 
succcss.

TIMELY TOPICS
Night school is under way otici 
more, and the Bureau of Recommen­
dations will again assist men in 
finding employment.
At this time the Bureau wishes 
to sound a word of caution to 
night school men. Those Who are 
employed at the present time should 
make every effort to retain their 
positions, as new ones arc at a 
premium just now, and it is impos­
sible to fortell just when condi­
tions arc likely to becomc settled.
As conditions improve the Bureau 
will keep the student bodv informed 
through the TARTAN and PLAID, 
so that those who arc anxious to 
make a change may submit their 
applications.
Office hours will be maintained as 
in the past, 9 to 5 daily, and Monday 
and Thursday evenings from 6:30 
to S:30.- All students arc invited to 
conic in to discuss their problems.

Prof. Thomas D. Mylrea, who 
has been confined to the Allegheny 
General Hospital since September 22, with a spinal disorder, is hop­
ing to be back with the Depart­
ment of Building Construction by 
the beginning of next week. In 
his absence Professor Dunnclls is

Professor Kindred McLeary, of 
the department of Architecture, has 
been announced winner of the sec­
ond prize , in the A. W. Brown 
Traveling Scholarship Camp for the 
design lie submitted to this national 
contest in; the early summer. Of 
the one hundred drawings 1 entered, 
Professor McLcary's. design won 
for him a prize of two hundred 
dollars. The first prize was a 
year’s study in Europe.
.The architectural' drawing was 
a design of an enclosed court of 
an exposition building which was 
required to symbolize manufacture. 
The ’ judging of the drawings took 
placc in New Orleans, where Pro­
fessor McLcary’s .projcct gained its 
recognition in June.
A most interesting display of chil­
drens’ art work is being shown 
in the College of Fine Arts by Mr. 
Armando del Cimmuto,- who was 
graduated last year from Carnegie’s 
College of Fine Arts.
Th- works arc : II oil paintings 
done by children, between the ages
of 9 and 17, of the art classes of 
the Irene Katifmann Settlement, Cen­
ter avenue, Pittsburgh. Mr. del Cim­
muto has taken charge of the classes 
since graduation and is a pioneer
in the Pittsburgh district in the
teaching of children in oil painting. 
Me has received encouragement and 
able assistance from Mr. Rosenberg, 
instructor in the College of Fine 
Arts.
The exhibit is well, worth seeing 
for the work is done remarkably 
well, considering the ages of the
youthful painters. It stands as a 
revelation of the artistic tempera­
ment of the Pittsburgh youth, when 
that temperament is encouraged.

Grover Carlton Smith, honor 
graduate of the class of 1915, 
Chemical Engineering department, 
died on September 24.
Mr. Smith was graduated from 
Carnegie in 1915, having been 
awarded a Bachclor of Scicncc de­
gree, after working as an industrial 
chemist for three years lie returned 
to Carnegie to ably instruct the 
classes in,freshman chemistry. He 
remained at Carnegie until 1920 
when he left to take a position at 
the University of Cincinnati.
While at the University of Cin­
cinnati, Smith held the title of 
Assistant Professor of Chemical 
Engineering, and during his stay 
there he installed their first lab­
oratory of Industrial Chemistry and 
Engineering.
While capably filling this position 
at the university, Mr. Smith was 
also an active worker in connec­
tion with the industrial survey 
which was being made at that time 
by the Chamber of Commerce of 
Cincinnati. This survey was for 
the purpose of scientifically study­
ing the Cincinnati district with the 
object of determining the proper 
location of industries in that local­
ity. The industries which came to 
their consideration were the ones 
that logically should be located 
in the vicinity of Cincinnati be­
cause of natural advantages.
Smith’s work on this survey 
brought him into touch with the 
men and officials of the city who
During the summer many new

Reserve books, such as those 
used as Freshman Industrial His­
tory outside reading texts, are 
kept at the Library desk. They may 
be ucsd only in the Library during 
the day and may be borrowed, for 
overnight use until 9:30 the fol­
lowing morning with a fine of five

David H. E. Gentcr was elected 
to head the Y. M. C. A. cabinet 
this year at a cabinet meeting held 
last Thursday, October 2. Mr. 
Center replaces Francis Downs who 
did not return to school this year.
Plans for the membership drive 
were discussed at the cabinet meet­
ing. A new, more adaptable plan was 
discussed, and it L hoped by the 
cabiivet that a more efficient cam­
paign may - be put on this year. A 
big feature of the three dollar mem­
bership this year is the fact that it 
entitles the holder to the full 
privileges of the Downtown Y. M. 
C. A. In the past, in order to enjoy 
the facilities of the Downtown Y. M. 
C. A., a five dollar membership card 
had to be held.
In connection with the membership 
drive, a banquet will be held in the 
Commons for both men and women 
sometime in the near future. A 
prominent speaker, will deliver the 
main address.
It is hoped by the cabinct that 
the students will take a real inter­
est in the drive. Besides being an 
organization devoted to high re­
ligious ideals, the Y. M. C. A. 
holds a corn roast and banquet for 
freshmen during Freshmen week, pro­
vides blankets for the football play­
ers and Kiltie Band at football 
games, sponsors th:-. chapel programs, 
aids the students in affiliating with 
the various churches of the district, 
cashes checks for the students, and 
maintains a club room for study­
ing. A great deal of the operating 
money of the organization comes 
from membership dues, and so it 
is felt by the cabinct that all of 
the students will wholeheartedly back 
the membership drive.

lirst names. This lack of exclusive­
ness appalled the scientist, accus­
tomed to the traditions of the old 
school which maintains that the 
faculty must “know its place and 
take it”—and woe to the instructor 
who unwittingly parks in a doctor’s 
scat!
Continuing with his comment on 
our colleges, he considered them to 
be very practical, but thought that 
they were at fault in their over­
emphasis of the utilitarian aspects 
of education, and in extending the 
methods and discipline of high 
school into the college classes. Too 
often, lie says, our task in hand is 
visualized only from the angle of 
the number of hours spent in the 
classroom, or the amount of out­
side reading done—rather than its 
quality of efficiency in preparing 
the student to cope with the prob­
lems of life. The “yes or no” type 
of quiz surprised him in its narrow 
scope and unfairness. But cheer 
up collegians,' for he paid our labs 
and research departments high 
praise, commending their personnel 
and equipment, which compares 
favorably with Germany’s.
Herr Scientist is a man after our 
own hearts, for he thinks our sky- 
scrape-s beautiful, and waxed lo­
quaciously enthusiastic over their 
merits. Iiis orderly German eye 
was outraged, however, at the sight 
of wastepapcr and other refuse that 
littered'the streets, as well as by 
the extreme ugliness of .many, of 
our small towns and cities.
The “servant problem” had him 
slumped; lie was amazed to dis­
cover that many cultured and emi­
nently respectable people kept none 
at all, but—had he prolonged his 
visit another six months, he prob­
ably would have understood. Ger­
man servants, we arc told, have 
the rare qualities of obedience, fru­
gality, and respectful mien.
We are known abroad as a warm­
hearted, impulsive nation, and this 
same cordiality impressed him 
enough to be his fifth point of 
difference.
In general, his observations arc 
quite accurate, and we wish to 
commend both the German from 
dver the seas and his auditor who 
relayed his ideas to us. We arc 
grateful to both of them Jor their 
entertaining ability, and also for 
rubbing off a bit of our national 
pride, which tends to swell at 
times!
were politically prominent, and 
when, soon afterwards, the city 
adopted the City Manager form of 
government, Smith was selected as 
Technical Advisor to Col. Sherrill 
who was the first man to head 
this new type of government in 
Cincinnati. Smith’s work as tech­
nical advisor brought him face to 
face with all the problems of a 
chemical nature that the city gov­
ernment had to deal with. For 
many of these problems lie was 
able to offer able solutions. H2 
was at the height of his activities 
as technical advisor when he met 
his untimely death. ‘

Now that Thiel's scalp has been 
added to the Carnegie boys’ list of 
trophies, everyone is looking forward 
to next week’s encounter with Georgia 
Tech and especially to the big game 
the following week with Notre 
Dame at South Bend. With the 
strong team that we now have and 
with an even share in the breaks, 
the Tartans should have an excellent 
chance to break the Irish’s long 
winning .streak and to avenge last 
season’s defeat. It is hoped that a 
large section of the student body 
will accompany the team to cheer 
them on in their challenge to Notre 
Dame football supremacy.
Special accommodations have been 
arranged for the team and their 
supporters. The railroad, fare will be 
$13.92 for the round trip, but these 
prices will be good . only on . the 
special train, which will leave the 
P. and L. E. station Friday evening, 
October 17, at if o’clock Pittsburgh 
time, arriving in South Bend Satur­
day at 7 a. m. Central time. Com­
ing back the train will pull out at 
11 p. m. Central time and will ar­
rive in Pittsburgh on Sunday at nine 
in the morning.
Pullman accommodations have also 
been secured for those making the 
trip. Lower berths are $4.50 and 
uppers $3.60; drawing^ rooms are 
$16.50. Every effort has. been''made' 
to make the trip comfortable for 
those who wish to see the big 
game.
The kickoff is slated to'come off 
at 2 p. m. Central time; at the new 
Notre Dame stadium. The graduate 
manager’s office has had no definite 
word from South Bend concerning 
the price of tickets to the game, but 
estimates were given that the little 
pasteboards will set back the Car­
negie fans about three iron men.
Nothing has been heard as to 
whether the Irish ’ads have arranged 
any dances, bull fights, or draw 
poker games for the entertainment 
of the visitors. It is a well known 
fact however that South Bend is 
something more than a whistle stop 
for fast freights, so the Carnegie 
well-wishers should nqt be forced 
to - put in a boring evening studying

day fro;' 3:30 to 5:C0, on Thursday

from 2:30 to 4:30 p. m. The archery

To obtain W. A. A. practicc points, 
everyone must attend two-thirds of 
all scheduled practices. Seventy-five 
arc given for one season. All begin-’ 
ncrs must attend the regular prac­
tices in order tnat they may receive 
the proper instructions. Advanced 
archers may practice at other times 
providing they consult, the archery 
manager who is Dorothy Shults. 
Everyone must shoot two rounds or

esting and at the same time least

Carnegie. The tournaments, held at 
the end of the spring season,’ arc 
always exciting and much keen rivalry 
is exhibited by the girls competing.

Thc Carnegie Tech Plcbcs opened 
their first home game with a 7-6 
win over the strong W. & J. fresh­
man team. Although the young 
Presidents had a heavier outfit, both 
teams were evenly matched, and put 
up a scrap to the finish. The fracas 
was marked with numerous fumbles 
and interceptions of passes, the lat­
ter due to the fact that both teams 
resorted to aerial activities early in 
the game.
The first quarter saw W. & J. 
take the upper hand with numerous 
line plunges and aggressive offensive 
work. Deacle, of the visitors, lived 
up to his name of "Five Yard” and 
made some big gains for ,the Presi­
dents. In the second quarter, how­
ever, the Plcbcs tighcncd up a bit, 
and now and then threw the W. & 
.1. yearlings for costly losses. The 
first scoring of the game came when 
Deacle shoved off on a wide end 
run and did some pretty broken 
field running for W. & J’s touch­
down. The kick for goal however, 
failed. Then after a- scries of passes 
and penalties Bcvcvino heaved a 
beautiful pass to Stewart who in 
turn romped over the line for a 
comeback over W. & J. Not satisfied 
with this he . proceeded to boot the 
ball between the posts for the extra 
point. Scorc—Tech 7, W. & J. 6.
The last half saw both teams re­
sorting to aerial work and punts. 
Fumbles and interceptions of passes 
were numerous, and a few times were 
threatening. The game ended with 
the young Tartans in possession of 
the ball on the W. & J. 35 yard line.
Stewart, Croft, Bcvcvino, Saylcs, 
arid Tesser starred for the Plcbcs, 
while Deacle was by far the big 
shot of the Presidents. With the 
exception of the first quarter, the 
Plcbcs played a good brtind of ball, 
and although they were outweighed 
a trifle they evened up for it in 
speed and general. all-around play- 
ing.

Extensive plants for Carnegie’s 
1931 swimming campaign will be­
gin with a meeting of varsity and 
plebe candidates in the T rophy 
Room at 4 o’clock on Friday, 
Oct.. 10; Freshmen aspirants for 
the managerial poskion should also 
put in an appearance at the . ap­
pointed time and place. For the 
benefit of freshmen, the Trophy 
Room is in the Gym and seems 
to suggest Carnegie’s branch of 
the Tiffany show room.
Captain A1 Redding, Edwards, 
Estabrooke, Bergman, King, and 
Hazlcwood. of last year’s team arc 
expected to prove useful in the 
coming meets. Williamson and 
Kountz, swimmers of a few years 
back, will splash into action this 
season. In ‘ the j sophomore ranks 
we find Frankc, Jergc, Cadmus 
and Coulter, plebe. captain of last 
year. Under the able tutalcgc of 
Cbach Risedorph this squad will 
have to put in many hard licks to 
surpass the doings of last year’s 
to?.m. That season is the best so 
far, and showed that the fresh 
water sport at our school is on 
the upward trend.
The. .conditioning .campaign will 
run,ion a dry platform for about a 
month. Steel lockers take the 
! place of the old ljjckoxy limb, and 
instead of splashing into the water 
the swimmers will, take to the ex­
ercise room. Here the kinks and 
hollows will be worked in and out, 
So, that the, pros’pcctivc swimmer 
can pick up the girl friend’s ham£ 
kerchief any time and not feel the 
physical exertion for a few day* 
hence.
Freshmen with ability and plen­
ty of interest, we mean in swim­
ming, arc urged to report. Previ­
ous experience is helpful, but not 
nccessary, for swimmers have been 
developed within the four or more 
vcarst The covctccl numerals arc 
awarded to most of the plebe 
team, and a few trips arc on the 
schedule.
Coach Hal forty’s cross-country har­
riers are rounding themselves into

Geneva on October 18 and from all 
early . indications, Ihe wearers of 
the plaid are in for a good season.. 
At the time trials held last Friday 
afternoon, Captain Jesse Price,. Ralph 
Franks, John Lord, and cx-Captain 
Page Worley finished in a group, 
with Ramsey, Silver, Krebs, Gideon, 
Neff, Burns, and Ishcrwood . close 
on their heels. A . large squad has 
turned out this year, and as a re­

positions. Coach Halfcrty announces 
that time trials will be held again 
next Friday afternoon1 at 4:30 to de­
termine the team to represent Car­
negie Tech in the Geneva , meet.
An attractive schedule has been ar­
ranged this year consisting of two

The Carnegie Rifle team will be 
unable to start practicc for the 
coming season for several weeks due 
to lack of a range. The old range 
under Margaret Morrison building is 
being remodeled and a concrete floor 
being put in it. When finished, it 
should be one of the finest in the 
country. Lieutenant Cothran said lie 
did not expect the work to be done 
before the last week in October.
Although the team lost scvgral 
crack shots by graduation, there arc 
one-or two good men from last 
I year’s Plebe tea'm who should be 
a’ 1c to fill their shoes. 'Captain

The Women’s Point System
On every college campus there are students who, because 
of greater ability and more initiative, participate in more activi­
ties than their classmates. Students at Carnegie are not differ­
ent from those on other campuses and we find a relatively small 
percentage of the enrollment governing the various extra-curric­
ular activities.
In an endeavor to encourage those of slightly less ability 
and initiative, the women of Carnegie a'few years ago instituted 
the Women’s Point System. By this system the various offices 
md positions which were open to women were divided into( live 
classes, basing the division, as much as possible, upon the 
responsibility and work involved in filling the requirements of 
the position. Restrictions were thpn placed upon the number 
of offices in ea^h group which one student might hold.
Insofar as the Point System allows participation of a greater 
number of Carnegie women in activities, its work is to be 
•.ommendcd. During the early years of its existence it investi­
gated each case of an over-loaded schedule of activities. If the 
student in question was considered able td' do justice to her 
cxtra-currucular offices and at .the same time db creditable work 
in her studies, the Chairman of the Point System gave her 
approval to a petition to Student Council for the retention of the 
¡»xtra offices. This recommendation of the petition by the chair­
man was almost certain to be followed by its ratification by 
Council.
This year, however, the members of the Point System com­
mittee have put into effect a new regime. Petitions to Council, 
•egardless of the ability of the girl wishing to present the peti­
tion to do capably and efficiently the work involved in her 
various activities and still maintain a’scholastic standing which 
is highly satisfactory, arc discouraged and have been, with one 
exception, refused, Such a procedure adheres closely to the 
purpose for which the system was established, but; the com- 
mi!fee should realize that unintentional injustice1 may result 
from a sudden change in the application of any set of rules.
There are girls on the Carnegie campus who have worked 
diligently and enthusiastically in many activities, believing that 
if their work was rewarded by appointments to such offices as 
exceeded the quota allowed by the Point System they could, 
provided their grades were above the average, retain all the 
<iUires through the consent of the Women's Point System com- 
iuitl.ee and of the Student Council. The sudden ' change in 
policy of the committee has forced the resignation o,f. a few 
girls who have worked for several years to gain the appoint­
ment, or election, to office and Who/understand fully the respon­
sibility involved in the position.
These vacancies will, in all probability, be filled by individ­
uals who have done much less work for the organization con­
cerned and whose knowledge and experience, in the work are 
slight.
Such a procedure is not only disappointing to the student 
who has worked hard and faithfully but who is not permitted 
to “reap where she has sown,” but it is harmful to the organiza­
tion from which she is forced to resign as it results in the 
weakening of the staff. <
We admire the theory of the Women’s Point System, but 
we believe that this year the committee should accept, and 
present to Council, petitions from those upperclassmen who have 
worked several years to attain offices they now hold. By so 
doing, and by refusing all other petitions, the committee will 
lay the foundations for their new "no petition plan” and still 
be just to those who entered a variety of activities before this 
plan was put into effect. G. B.

Mr. Darrow Speaks
Clarence Darrow, famous criminal lawyer and one. of the 
most outstanding agnostics in the country is scheduled to speak 
tonight at Carnegie Music Iiall. Three other speakers are 
scheduled also, but Mr. Darrow, as is always the case when 
he is present, will dominate the group.
The appearance of Mr. Darrow so close to Carnegie offers 
an enviable opportunity to the student body to hear and- see 
one of the country’s leading individuals expounding his theories 
on that much discussed and always interesting subject—religion
Carnegie students receive all too little opportunity to ac 
quaint themselves with affairs outside the immediate educational 
scope of the Institute. Lecturers visit here, ’tis true, but all of 
them speak on technical subjects and most of them arc poor 
speakers.
Mr. Darrow is not: a technical man and he is certainly not 
a poor speaker. Carnegie students should relish the change and 
should make an effort to hear him, and Carnegie professors 
should smile tolerantly if some of their pupils arc not so well 
prepared on the morrow. Education can be acquired in more 
wavs that one and passing up an assignment to hear Mr. Dar­
row would not exactly be neglect of work. Rather, it would 
be education in a different manner.

Hellow Folks!
Some of the boys seem to have 
taken seriously the remark about 
the encroaching masculinity of Car­
negie lassies. Last week witnessed 
the appearance on the campus of 
that unmistakable marl: of mascu­
line campus—the corduroy trouser. 
Pipes and corduroy trousers are 
the last resorts of indignant males 
whose habits and haunts arc being 
invaded by the so-called “meeker” 
sex.
“Chuck" Miller and Henry “June” 
Schultz were among the wearers of 
the welted pants last week, while 
at least three other pairs were wit­
nessed' striding the campus. They 
will be recognized by their dawn- 
grey-color and their tendency to 
hang loosely like burlap bags.
Cwcns and Druids begin their 
financial year Thursday afternoon 
with the dance in the Union. These 
dances are called “tea” dances, but 
for no good reason. They don't 
even serve cookies. Some Cwcn 
must have taken a liking to Jerry 
McGeorge, for he seems a fixture 
as the tea dance orchestra leader. 
Nobody seems to object, either, 
Among the co-eds at the dance 
there will undoubtedly be Ruth 
Elaine Nyc, Alice Work, Gloria 
Kloos, Gladys Woods, Hazel 
Gough, Betty Cooper, Ann Warden, 
Marian McMary, Kay Wholcy, 
Betty -P,roller, Floy Sample, Ade­
laide McCloskey, Katherine Jessop, 
Nancy Sloan, Ida Campbell and 
some more good dancers.
The stag line, will include Jack 
Horning, Fred Faherty, M. Al­
bert Kinley, W. ‘ Howard Sprcnklc, 
James “Red” Fergus, Jimmy Leon-, 
ard, Jim Corrigan, Bill Bryant, Al 
Hall, Rodger McNaughton, Bill 
Conway, Rcgev Binder, and of spe­
cial mention, " tlie editor of the 
Tartan.
The cover charge of fifty cents 
for boys and two-bits for girls isn’t 
reasonable, as the former work 
twice as hard as the latter to get 
dances. There is no justice.
The Arts school . sophomores 
seem to be the only ones holding 
trials. Last Thursday was punish­
ment day in Arts foyer, with one 
plcbe pulling a little cart behind 
him, offering rides, another drag 
ging a frankfurter,and barking fero­
ciously, and three more shining the 
architects’ sadly neglected shoes. 
We understand one plcbe was sup­
posed to do something with a dish 
of peas', but we; couldn’t lind him.

SIMILIS SIMILARIBUS
To cull the motto of the homeo­
pathists—"Like cures like”—I want 
to discuss a peculiar tendency of 
the undergraduate. After ./Studying 
and observing a long scries of 
cases, peeping in fraternity houses, 
crashing dances, going to the 
library, watching the underclassman 
at home and abroad, in short, 
tracking him to his innermost lair, 
I think I know something about 
him.
This, is the summary of my re­
search. For the first two years 
of his undergraduate career, the 
student, scholar,' (call him what you 
will) does everything in his power 
to be like everyone else. In his 
junior year, there is a transition, 
sometimes a very sudden one, and 
he swings into the attitude of be­
coming an individual, His senior 
years finds him a full- blown in­
dividualist, and then, very quietly, 
there is another transition, and he 
oozes back into the common herd.
Let’s develop this-a Tittle further. 
He comes from the l^igli school to 
the college. He is generally gawky, 
adolescent, ill-clad. He sees and 
envies the clothes of the smooth 
boys. He meets a maiden at a 
fraternity rushing dance, only to 
have her snatched from his arms 
by the verbal ‘lasso of a -junior 
line. Result—our freshman begins 
to imitate. His; first new suit of 
clothes is an event. It must be 
the prevailing mode par excellence. 
He acquires a line, lie- learns wise­
cracks, he adopts mannerisms. He 
fits closer and closer into the mold.
But the sophomore becomes even 
more close to the model. He has 
lost .whatever trace . of . freshman 
shyness remains. He becomes . glor­
iously and blatantly collegiate. Bc- 
knickered, hc^ is- the college boy of 
the cartoons. He knows cve.rythingj 
he has taken a course in psychol­
ogy, lie has had many feminine 
conquests over the-summer, lie has 
taken the words of others and put 
them in his own mouth, and he has 
enough high school girls in love 
with him because they think he is 
cute.
Some men never grow out of the 
sophomore mold. But a number 
do. There is 5. time during the 
junior 3-ear when the break comes. 
The first sign, perhaps, is the 
change in dress. The man quits 
imitating every one else on the 
campus, and tries to wear clothes 
which will reflect his personality, 
sic! He may go in for highbrow 
stuff. He dabbles, perhaps,' with 
short stories. Or he sees a play 
or two. And he quits his line and 
gets serious. There is much long 
conversation now on dates anent 
SEX. He feels in his own heart 
that he is beginning to arrive ;tt 
niaturity, and actually lic is.' A dis­
gust of the monotony arid sameness 
of the pattern -seizes him and lie 
bends every effort to become differ­
ent. He abhors the herd.
Eventually lie may become a
senior. And then, slowly but sure­
ly, the ego-radicalism of the junior 
year fades.f He dresses a little less 
bizar.rely. His diction is a little 
less florid, and though he maj- still 
talk much the same, lie now has 
vague notions that much that lie 
says may be words and very little 
else. Top, lie has discovered that 
bucking the mob is not so easy-as 
swimming along with it, and is
infinitely less pleasant. Slowly the
mold hardens again, until on the 
day when he is ready to march 
with a thousand other molds in
blaclc robes to receive a sheepskin, 
he again becomes nothing more 
.than a pattern, although by .this 
time lie is often conscious that he 
is just another product spewed out 
by the educational machine.

"Run the j

“Operate buses yourself; do it better than 
the wildcat independents,” fired back the 
Editor of 'Electric Railway Journal . . . 
and announced a new publication, Bus 
Transportation, to help develop that infant 
industry.
Quickly a powerful association of street 
railway men rose up in arms . . . roundly 
condemned the editor, his new “bus 
journal” and its publishers.
What happened? Bus Transportation swiftly 
proved the Editor right . . . showed the 
pl?ice of the motor bus in modern trans­
portation . . . until today practically every
electric railway operates buses in con­
junction with its street car lines.

Sound knowledge of the facts, ability to 
look ahead clearly, courage to tell a whole 
industry when it is in error—these quali­
ties are characteristic of McGraw-Hill 
Editors. That’s w'hy industry and business 
value these publications so highly.
That’s why the McGraw-Hill paper, which 
covers the field you expect to enter, will 
help you get ready for your first job.

123,000 tests a year
In the Crane testing laboratories, the 
weight arm of a specially designed ma­
chine measures the steadily increasing 
load suspended from a small cylinder of 
metal. Watching it intently is a man who 
has at his command instruments that 
measure to .00005 an inch- The cylin­
der begins to yield; he notes the weight.
It snaps; he notes the weight. Disen­
gaging it, he measures the stretch and 
diameter at the breaking point. These 
tests form a part of the 123,000 determi­
nations Crarie Co. makes on its own ma­
terials every year.
63,000 of the tests are chemical; not one 
component from pig iron to limestone 
flux is charged in a Crane melting furnace 
whose suitability has not been determined 
by analysis. 60,000 are physical* not 
one hour’s melt is drawn off in a Crane 
foundry whose physical properties:—ten­
sile, transverse, and torsional strengths, u 
yield point, breaking point, elongation, 
and reduction of area are not known.
By such exhaustive tests and by re­
searches of scientists in Crane laboratories, 
a vast body of authoritative data on metals 
and their properties has been collected.
It is embodied in a book, “Pioneering in 
Science,” which is an invaluable reference 
book for students. On request, we will 
send it to you.
