Once upon a time there was a 
college that had every opportunity 
in the world to become a seat of 
knowledge and fame. It was sit­
uated in fine industrial environ­
ment and lacked no reason for be­
coming the only pebble on the beach.
Now it so happened that the stu­
dent body Decame indifferent with j 
regards to their duties to Alma: 
Mater. They rushed, through their 
daily routine and sluggishly respond­
ed to appeal for pep. They became 
possessed of an instinct that, the 
kempus was to walk upon and the 
cement walks to look at. In the 
course of time the lawns acquired 
dissecting paths, ungainly rubbish 
piles and numerous budding lumber 
yards.
Out of these various No Man’s 
Lands rose stately buildings, pleas­
ing to the eye with their magnificent 
architecture. But the beauty of these 
abodes of learning was sadly marred 
by the surrounding debris until the 
scene resembled a construction 
camp. And yet when the cream of 
the multitude was appealed to, to 
take pride in their Alma- Mater and 
to keep off the verdant vegetation 
they looked insulted and eleVated 
their-- nasal • organ into the peaceful 
atmosphere.
Very soon the people ceased to per­
ambulate through the college grounds 
because of their ugliness. Prospec­
tive geniuses turned away scornfully 
xand athletics were frowned on as de­
trimental to the annexation of a de­
gree. Even when the students' de­
sired to show that they were not 
mummified and could work up plenty 
of pep at a basket ball game the 
magnitude of the assembly was lim­
ited by the incapable facilities for 
witnessing such aforementioned func­
tions. Thus gradually did stagnation 
settle upon an aspiring knowledge 
factory.
Then one day the guiding spirits 
of the school woke up to the fact 
that their mill of learning was show­
ing up. Immediately a. live wire got 
in contact with the dynamic qualities 
of the school and the machinery 
started with a whir. The gladsome 
noise of the meshing gears echoed 
throughout the country and all papers 
vied with each other in trying to get 
across the -greatest line about .he 
school and its activities.
The school sat up, rubbed its eyes, 
got on its feet and hied itself ,for a 
new goal. Unsightly obstructions 
were erased, walks straightened, 
heard-hearted professors becamf? 
genial. Athletics were countenanced, 
facilities for entertainment were pro­
vided and capable men put into vari­
ous positions to aid the heavily bur­
dened students.
In their race for fame, the aspir­
ing B. S.’s and B. A.’s did not fail 
to watch and improve conditions at 
their Alma Mater.
They united to clean up the cam­
pus and heeded the “keep off the 
grass” signs. Soon the people again 
walked through the grounds of tho 
awakened college and marvel they 
did at the transformations accom­
plished.
The school made quite a big splash 
in the pond of education and its ever- 
broadening ripples were looked on 
with envy by the lesser splashes. 
Very soon the ripple overcame the 
rest and the name of the- college be­
came a household phrase and an 
oath by which justice swore.. Edu­
cation took its throne to this school, 
and from far. and near came the hun­
gry throngs to satiate their desires 
for learning.
From the beautiful campus and 
stately buildings knowledge and ath­
letic .prowess and good fellowship 
was dispersed and to the four corners 
of the earth the eternal winds car­
ried the praise and fame of this in­
stitution.
Moral:—Forget that you are an 
ostrich, pull your head out of the 
sand, look wise a^d get busy.
TECH Q U OT A—$30,000
Bond information—Loan will prob­
ably talco tho form of short term 
notes, perhaps only for five years. 
Bonds of the last issue mature in 
ton years. These Victory bonds will 
mature in flvo years. Probably there 
will be two kinds of bonds -tax-free 
bonds paying a low rate of interest, 
and taxable bonds paying a higher 
rato of interest,..
Appreciation of Bonds—Civil War 
bonds were worth $130 ten years 
after issue. Spanish War bonds 
were worth $130 ten years after is­
sue. It. is a paying proposition to 
hold your bonds.
Reasons for Buying Victory Bonds 
—If tho Victory Loan is not accom­
plished, it will mean nioro taxes.
This must not bo a capitalist's 
loan. The capitalist with a million 
dollars income 'has to pay an ineomo 
tax of seventy per cent. Moreover, 
•was thisj a rich man's war? Do you 
want to have it said that the rich 
men won the war? Remember that 
in buying bonds, the idea should he 
to help our country—patriotism—not 
personal profit.
Tho Victory Loan must be a popu­
lar loan—The financial burden of tho 
banks is tremendous in any case; 
they cannot absorb the loan. It 
would create unhealthy business con­
ditions, for if the banks took it they 
would have to go to tho Federal Ro- 
serve banks who would have to issuo 
more currency, thus inflating tho 
value of money in circulation. Wo 
are depending on the banks to lend 
after this slump in business; they 
cannot do this if wo depend on them 
to absorb the loan.
If wo are opposed to tho Presi­
dent's policy, remember this was our 
war, not President Wilson's war. 
Patriotism seals our months until this 
drive is over. Wo are foiu'-fiftlia 
through. Who wants lo stop when 
four-fifths of our task Is accomplish­
ed?
Carnegie Tech Day at Victory 
Square—1The second Saturday of tho 
Victory DrK’o. t’arnogie Tech will 
have chargo of soiling bonds at Vic­
tory Square. Bonds sold that day will 
bo credit od to I lie Tech quota.
m When "Tech” was first founded 
[ftnany plans were made which at 
¦»that time were an advance of any- 
¦thing in technical schools. As the 
¦plans scame to be realized many 
¦changes have taken place due chiefly 
»o these causes. First, something 
Tbetter was found to take their place 
las far instance the gymnasium, as it 
»was -proposed—a part of a bridge— 
\mnl as it no doubt will be in the near 
feature—an architectural addition to 
il&ir school. Secondly, it was found 
JjBnpracticable to continue the plans. 
UJiluch a case was found in the orifi- 
l^inal plans of Machinery Hall. The 
[¿/difficulty was in the fact that the
I Baltimore, and Ohio Railroad Com-
l-pany has a bond filed against land
II owned by the city and for this rea- 
1 son the tower had to be built back!
"-"om the tracks.
Vhe predominant idea of the four 
:hools has ,been to be abreast of the 
me. When the school started thir- 
en years ago the Mechanical Labor- 
ory was one of the finest in the 
mntry for undergraduate work. But 
boratories become* out of date very 
lickly and today our laboratory is 
it what it should be. Of course this 
due to the fact that education 
ong mechanical lines is very rapid 
id calls'for a continuous stream of, 
iw equipment to keep it up-to-date. 
Tentative plans are now being 
ade "by Professor Trink and his de- 
irtment for a laboratory that will be 
loroughly up-tffl-date and in keeping 
ith the policy of continual advance- 
ent shown by the college along 
*ery line.
The ground level of machinery hall 
to be lowered and a gallery placed 
jove the present heavy machinery 
boratory. This will enable the 
acement of the heavy machinery 
i the lowest level and the lightest 
achinery on the gallery.
Part of the new equipment will be 
r and ammonia refrigerators, 
imps, ovens and deisel engines. The 
illing mill will without doubt be in 
ace by the end of the present 
jliool year. This together with the 
irbine used by the naval engineering 
udents will give something that

Doherty Plays for All StarsSome of the spirit recently resur­
rected by the girls ot the Margaret 
Morrison Division has communicated 
itself to the men’s schools with the 
result that they have tnrown off the 
cloak of indifference and are about 
to co-operate wlt'h the administration 
in a new venture' >.t “Tech.” This 
co-operative movement will involve 
all four schools and the program of 
the day will be arranged by a com­
mittee, of which 1. S. Stark is chair­
man. The date has been set definite­
ly as April 23, and the committee 
has given out a skeleton outline of 
the day’s activities.
At 11:30 a. m., the entire personnel 
of schools will assemble in the Music 
Hall and will be treated to a rousing 
"pep” meeting conducted for and by 
the students. At the conclusion of 
the meeting a luncheon will be 
served by the Margaret Morrison and 
Design Girls on the Design lawn. 
This will be the most severe test to 
which the girls’ culinary art. will ever 
be subjected and it Is hoped Doctor 
Marks will not be swamped with 
calls the following day. After this 
noonday repast work will then be 
started in earnest. The land to be 
cleared includes the region between 
the cut and Margaret Morrison and 
the wilderness behind Design. Teams 
are to be organized and will be as­
signed, salients to be cleaned up. 
That team which does its task best 
will be given some prize by the girls, 
but the nature of this reward is to 
be kept secret by them. All the boys 
are requested to strive for this prize 
and the competition is expected to 
be keen. It is rumored that the Sci­
ence Seniors have organized and are 
practicing "clean up” after dark. The 
Plebes have promised to’ give to 
“Tech” its biggest bonfire yet. This 
is a big opportunity for' the “year­
lings” to demonstrate their spirit. 
This bonfire wip eclipse anything in 
that line yet produced around "Tech.” 
The committee is also endeavoring. 
to secure our embryo band to liven 
matters. Work will be accelerated 
by the “jazz” element and the morale 
will be raised. The ’’piece de resis­
tance” of the day will be the .“free 
for all” dance given in the Union. 
It is wanted by the committee to 
make this dance the crowning event 
of the day with “The End of a Per­
fect Day,” as the home waltz. This 
is just an outline of the day’s doings 
and will probably be touched up by 
interesting details and novelties to be 
given a trial in the “clean up” move­
ment.
The administration is earnestly be­
hind this movement and are offering 
inducements by which they expect 
the student body to join them in 
this activity. Now it remains for 
the students to co-operate in making 
“Tech” campus pleasanter and more 
inviting. To do this all must join 
together to give their heartiest co­
operation so that the experiment will 
be given a just trial and all indica­
tions point to the success of this 
novel movement.
A real sure enough' baseball game 
was played at “Tech” field, Carnegie 
Institute of Technology, Pittsburgh, 
Pa., on Saturday, April 12. The 
"Tech team” lined up against the 
All Stars and trimmed them to tho 
tupe of 7 to 6. The All-Star team 
was composed of former players on 
College teams and In organized base­
ball who reside i In Pittsburgh. Jim­
my Doherty, whet played shortstop for 
the All-Star aggregation was captain 
of the “Tech” team last year. This 
was the only team that ever beat tho 
University of Pittsburgh. Don Blythe 
of Grove City, |,Pa.. was a famous 
third basonian"with Penn State whoro 
he graduated In 1917. "Buck” Baird 
of Penn State, ’13, tho best basket 
call o/ficial in Westorn Pennsylvania, 
held down tho left garden. Bob Kess­
ler Penn State, ’If), held down tlm 
middle field. Albion Wardwoll, Cap­
tain of Penn State, '15, did the heav­
ing for tho ex’s, while “Doc” Marks 
and I-Ienry Blum couldn’t see a per­
fectly good ball game go to waste 
for the lack of a couple of first base­
men and so alternated in this posi­
tion. In fact “Doc” looked quite nat­
ural in his red and blue jersey and 
cne could almost see him in tho old 
days on base at U. of P. The fea­
ture of tho game wero the fielding of 
Gates and the batting of young Do­
herty of the “Tech” team. Both
teams played pretty ragged ball as 
the score Indicates. The All-Stars 
had been out of the game too long to 
play concertedly and “Tech” did not 
seem to have their bearings yet.
There will have to be a markod im­
provement in the ‘Tech” game If 
they hope to do anything with Du- 
quesne. 'The lineup and box score 
follows:
In addition to the present two op­
tions, now given by this department, 
namely the steel course and the pow­
er 'plant course there will be offered 
a new course beginning next, year. 
This will be in aeronautical engineer­
ing and will be in the line with those 
offered by other leading educational 
institutions. The equipment may be 
J loaned by the Government or it may 
be purchased directly by the author- 
jjlities. It is expected that this course 
xv will appeal to many of the students 
H who took up flying in the army and 
H having made good there wish to con- 
^ tinue this work in civil life. Judging 
rju'rom the rest of the equipment we 
¦ pan at least be sure that this equip-i
jment will be up-to-date in every re- 
ispect.
I Last winter considerable trouble 
Was experienced with a shortage of 
(gas. As this directly affected the in­
stitution's power plant and heating 
,.J facilities, a new fuel was necessary 
R/To this end the services of Mr. Bar- 
| onner have been secured. The pres- 
R ent plan is to install a coal handling
¦ system which will enable the fuel to
¦ be taken from the cars and placed di- 
¦recfiy under the furnaces. With this 
¦installed, there will be no fear of fu- 
¦ture cold snaps.
¦ Today, Tech while a young school,
I is nevertheless one of - the leaders
r along educational lines. Her con- 
) tributiohs as brought out by the war, 
have been many. The most rabid 
pessimists can not help but see her 
brilliant future. To make this future 
the best possible it is necessary to 
have our old graduates become stu­
dents again or rather do post grad; 
uate work. This will be one of the 
objects of. the new equipment which 
is being planned and which we hope 
the near future will see installed.
At the present time a test is being 
run a Hollis tractor engine. The 
test is to be of such a duration as a 
trip from New York to ’ San Fran­
cisco. The load is being applied by 
means of an air propeller and is 
slightly in excess of the engine rat­
ing. The engine itself is of a new 
and .light 'design which its perform­
ance is justifying.

The news has just come to light 
that the Freshman and Junior Girls’ 
classes at the Margaret Morrison di­
vision engaged in a' terrific basket 
ball battle a week ago. According to 
fairly authentic reports the freshmen 
were duly swamped to the tune of 
55 to 20. Eyewitnesses say the fea­
ture of the game was the speedy 
wprk of the Junior forwards, Miss 
Marion Batchellor and Miss May 
Bechtel. Our correspondent was un­
able to get the box score, but the

THE R. O. T. C.
Military training in oJi two types; QJ: one type 0. L T. students 
Lave had plenty and some to spare while of the other they have had 
little or none.
The pure physical training, usually given as a part of the in­
fantry drill regulations, and practiced as such is obnoxious to free 
thinking people, foreign to their ideals of right and freedom, and can 
but meet with failure in a univesity or school .where freedom oil 
thought is fostered.
Turn your attention for a moment to the words of one who 
knows.
“University and military training are not compatible. The former 
fosters freedom of thought and action, a questioning and critical at­
titude,"while the latter requires an mi hesitating obedience, quite right 
in a military institution,'but not in a university.” In these words, 
J)ean S. 11. Goodnight, former director of education of the S. A. T. 
(!. at the University ol! Wisconsin, sums up the failure of the exten­
sion of. the United States military program into the higher schools 
of the country.
With these conclusions, let us turn our thoughts to tiie B; O. 
T. ('. as planned hero. This calls, for the other kind of training-1- 
namely, brain work. It does not require the “unhc/J'cating obedi­
ence” ol! the military drill. It gives the student a'chance to apply 
iiis knowledge. LI; gives him training he can use in life. It broadens 
his uud<;rsl,andmg and in case of 'further trouble, makes him of di­
rect, u.s'o I,o, the country in which he lives. ,
The plan as outlined here is not compulsory. That takes away 
one ol! Che most serious objections to anything of a military nature. 
The plan aims to enroll only those that care to take it.
further explanation is unnecessary, but Surely the good points 
of the plan are sell!-ovidenl;. Certainly there will be no difficulty in 
securing enough students to form a unit.
FAIR PLAY
lu the duration ol' the S. A. T. (!. (when not interfered with by' 
the “flu" or by military matters) classes at Tech were conducted as 
usual. One of the classes which was conducted in Science was a class 
in Sophomore Mathematics, While the classes wore ‘never overcrowd 
ed, those who did attend them did their work in regular Carnegie 
Tech style, so fur as circumstances permitted.
When classes were again established in January on jy pro-wav 
basis, all of those students who had attended classes satisfactorily 
‘when in the 8. .A, T. 0., were promised, and are supposed to have 
received, credit for I lie school work done. But the promise seems 
never to have been fulfilled* for a short time before the first semester 
exams, it was announced to those .Sophomores who had supposedly 
received credit for their work done previous to ’January, that they 
would be given an examination in the mathematics which they had 
studied when in the ,S. A. T. C. These men had, at I he beginning of 
the semester, been told that they need not study this .¡Mathematics 
tinder tutors, as the men who had come from the outside camps were 
doing: These same men who were tutored, when given an examina­
tion, found itij&t to impossible to pass, yet now, at the end of the 
semester, these men who hal, before January, studied half so far as 
the men who were tutored, are to be given an examination.

IF THIS, IS FAIR PLAY, WE HOPE THAT THE STUDENTS 
OF TECH MAY NEVER MEET WITH ANYTHING CROOKED. 
Certainly military promises and Tech requirements were foreign to 
each other.
A RIFLE TEAM
Many of the large colleges of the country have listed under the 
activities of the students, rifle teams. These teams compete with one 
another in “open meet” with small arms.
Such a team could be formed, at Tech and would be a valuable 
adjunct to the student activities. Such a team would be inexpensive. 
It would be easily handled and could boost Tech activities. How 
about a rifle team ?
THE UNION
The editor walked into the Union the other day and was sur­
prised to see one of “Science School’s” most noted Sophomores sit­
ting in a clmir with bis feet up on a nicely finished table. He was 
smoking a cigarette and when lie finished lie gave the cigarette a 
“thump” at the window. Needless to say, it hit the window sill 
and scattered ashes and tobacco over half a dozen seats and the of­
fending party went on with the story he was reading as nonchalant as 
if he were sitting under a tree and the cigarette had hit the tree.
1 siipjmsc this man had a mother. It is only right to suppose 
that she tried to make him a man, but she failed utterly. He is totally 
ignorant of the rules ol: politeness; disconsiderate of the rights of 
others and more ill bred than any man should be.
The Union is the Students’ C'lubroom. It is looked after by the 
Student Activities Board and is kept up by the students. The next 
time then, that you Want to throw away a “butt,” throw it in the 
spittoon. Protect your clubroom and keep it clean.

POLITENESS
As might be expected, Tech offers no course in social etiquette. 
This is not due to theQfact that Tech men do not need sueli a course, 
for-in the past year, the-majority of men attending the various 
dances here have neglected one of the elementary social conventions, 
that of addressing the chaperons.
It is recognized that chaperons are demanded for such occasions 
and what is more natural and i’igift than to request members of the 
faculty and their wives to serve in that capacity? The managers 
of the club have, howev.e'r^ had difficulty in getting chaperons from 
the faculty for their dances. Some of this reluctance on the part of 
the faculty to serve may be due to a disinclination to stay up after 
twelve o'clock ’.for the doubtful pleasure of a few dances and an ice. 
But that doe# not tell the whole story. Why should such a condition 
as this exj’Vi;? Let’s see.
If j- student were invited to a party at a private home, would he 
not consider it the proper and courteous thing to do to at least greet 
theijost and hostess as he. came in and to bid them goodnight as he 
leftV. He should ask himself this, “How many times have I spoken 
to a chaperon this last year?” Common courtesy demands that he at 
least do this much to show his,good will. At most of the parties there 
have been a few who have made it a point to speak to the chaperons, 
but a very few. How much better it would be iL! each man made it 
his first duty when he arrived to pay his respects to the chaperons 
and to say. goodnight to them Avlien lie left. It seems that this is the 
least that could be*expected of the students, and that if such a cour­
tesy Avcrc shown, there would be a kindlier feeling all around.

HR. STUART CRITICISES PLAY
(Continued-From Page One)
Miss Moving was better than Miss 
Floyd as “Ann,” and Miss .Floyd 
was hotter than Miss Moving as 
“Fanny” and therein llos a com­
pliment for each! Though both 
were charming as the fianco of 
“Don.” It soomod that Miss Moving,
got under the skin of “Ann” more 
completely than did Miss Floyd. Her 
impersonation was therefore more 
sincere; it rang more true.
Miss Floyd as “Fanny” the maid, 
irrespective of tlifc brevity of the part, 
did excellent, work; her little scene 
with “Thompson” was as discon­
certing as it should have been and 
was most realistic.

The prestige of The Tartan and its

Morry Goldman, who goes unler the 
familiar alias of “Second Story Mor­
ry," makes a distinctly individual of­
fer to pay for some good ideas; and 
presents it only to the Tech bunch, j
For several years now since he I 
opened his plAce, he’s been one of 
the best boosters tor the various 
Plaid papers, and he originated the 
various stunts of style shown in the 
schools. Since his small beginning 
he’s opened a new store at the cor­
ner of Fifth and Wood, with the 
largest young men’s stocks in town.
So get your cranium working for 
some new stunts he can use. You! 
know his style of advertising, and j 
lie’s such a happy go-luclcy fclow 
that you can’t tell: he might comej 
across with a check for two or three 
thousand, even though his announce­
ment elsewhere in the paper says; 
"two bits.”

The pathetic attempts to arduse 
student enthusiasm favóring an R. O. 
T. C. here have duplicated the fail­
ure of similar movements in other 
universities. The college man has 
clone his share, and more than this 
share, in the world struggle. He now 
wishes' to concern himself with the 
problems of collegiate and national 
reconstruction. H¿ is war-weary and 
inclined to deny his support, to the 
establishment of a permanently domi­
nant military caste in this land of 
the free. The S. A. T. C. has rem­
onstrated admirably the fact that 
academic and military work do not 
mix. If a man wishes to become a 
soldier let him go' to a military 
school. There are plenty of them. 
Pennsylvania has moré vital work 
in hand.
