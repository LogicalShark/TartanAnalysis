Dr. John Graham 
Appointed Dean
A new dean of students has been appointed here at Tech. 
He is Dr. John W. Graham Jr., former assistant dean in the Col­
lege of Science and Engineering. He fills the vacancy created by 
the resignation of Dean Ben E. David, who accepted a position at
the University of Miami, Florida.*--------------------------------------------------

Army Corps of Engineers. He 
was a major at the time of his 
discharge in 1945, and he was 
honored for his service during 
the entire Italian campaign.
F ior to his service in the 
Arm}', Dr. Graham received a 
bachelor of Civil Engineering 
degree from Princeton Univers­
ity (1940). He was associated 
with Bethlehem Steel between 
1940 and 1942.
At Tech, Dr. Graham has ad­
vanced rapidly. He was pro­
moted to -assistant professor of 
civil engineering a year after 
joining the institution and be­
came assistant to the dean in the 
College of Engineering and 
Science a year later. In 1950 he 
earned a Carnegie Tech Doctor

Student Activities 
To Be Boosted 
By Facuity Plan
New plans have been devised 
for the facilitation and more ef­
ficient coordination of student ac­
tivities here at Tech, Dr. J. W. 
Graham, new dean of students, 
announced Thursday.
It has long been felt that the 
students’ sense of social responsi­
bility and personal value could 
be developed more fully. Dr. 
Graham believes this goal can be 
realized best by guiding and co­
ordinating the extra-curricular 
activities in such a way as will 
coincide with the chief objectives 
of the Carnegie Plan of educa­
tion. “We believe that extra-cur­
ricular activities are pertinent to 
the life of the college student and 
that they will contribute in a 
tangible way to the intellectual 
enterprise in which the school is 
engaged. Tt is further hoped that 
th students wll use in these activ­
ities the same orderly method of 
analytic thinking that they are 
asked to use in the classroom.”
The Division of Student Per­
sonnel and Welfare, headed by 
[Continued on Page 3]
Dean Rice, who has taken over 
as head of the painting and de­
sign department, in addition to 
maintaining his duties as Dean 
of the Fine Arts School, has been 
concerned mainly with enlarging 
the department, consequently, he 
has initiated several major 
changes.
With the abolishment of a re­
quired technical examination, the 
1955 freshman class, with 80 stu­
dents, is almost twice the size of 
the two preceding entering 
classes. One reason for the in­
crease is the noticeable shortage 
of seniors in some options. The 
department plans to fill the pres­
ent gaps by increasing the fresh­
man class each year.
The department is also offer­
ing more courses to the stu­
dents, with a wider selection of 
electives being offered to the 
upperclassmen. One new feature 
of the department is the sculp­
ture option. In the past few 
years, sculpturing has been of­
fered only as an elective, but 
this year it is being restored to 
a full option.
New Faces in Department 
The department has also made 
several additions to its faculty. 
Clark Winter, associate professor 
in the sculpture department, 
comes to Tech from the Univer­
sity of California. He did under­
graduate work at Harvard, stud­
ied under Robert Laurent at In­
diana University, and taught at 
Kansas City Art Institute. Rich­
ard Beamer, also from California, 
was head of the art department 
at the University of Redlands 
theer. This year he will be an

Pan Hel Reception
The Pan Hellenic recep­
tion will be held at the Car­
negie Union Sunday, Sep­
tember 25, 1955, beginning at 
2:00 p.m. To be eligible for 
the fall rushing period a girl 
must have been on Tech’s 
campus at least one semester 
and have maintained a 2.00 
factor for the previous se­
mester. All those who are in­
terested are asked to sign up 
in the Dean of Women’s Of­
fice by Friday, September 23.
3500 Applicants 
Cause Rise In 
Tech Population
Although final enrollment sta­
tistics have not yet been re­
leased, approximate figures indi­
cate that there are about 3100 
students at Tech this year, an 
increase over the 2900 for the 
psat three or four years. Con­
trary to the prevalent student 
opinion, this increase of 200 is 
not due to an abnormally large 
freshman class, as there are only 
800 freshmen this year as com­
pared with 750 last year. Rather, 
there has been an increase in 
advanced standing transfer stu­
dents and graduate students.
The total applications for ad­
mission to CIT. numbered 3500 
while only 2500 applied last 
year. Only 900 of those 3500 
could be accepted. Such a large 
field of applicants indicates that 
the demand for higher education 
in the United States continues to 
expand at an increasing rate 
while the expansion of educa­
tional facilities is .still creeping 
along. “Our capacity is fixed,” 
explained Admissions Chairman 
Dr. John M. Daniels. “With our 
present facilities we can ade­
quately handle no more than 900 
new students each year.”
Freshman applicants to the 
College of Engineering and Sci­
ence this year numbered 2500 
and there were 200 additional 
transfer applications. In order to 
maintain Carnegie’s standards’ 
with our present faculty and fa­
cilities, only 400 freshmen and

As of Friday, September 16, the fraternities reported a total 
of only 168 pledges as compared with over 200 pledged at this 
time last year. This seems to indicate a conservative streak among 
the new students this year with many taking the advice to

This diagram shows the direct line responsiblities of the divisions of the Student Personnel 
and Welfare Department, as reorganized this summer in the hopes of better coordinating student 
activities, both curricular and extra-curricular.
Rush Week this year was run 
from a Wednesday through the 
next Tuesday, in the same man­
ner as last year, but with three 
date parties instead of two. This 
created an even bigger demand 
for the freshmen women who are 
often rushed harder than the 
men.

will be published in two or three 
weeks. Those pledged at pi'esent 
are:
Alpha Tau Omega: Paul E.

Big Push Ball Contest 
Finale for Orientation
% ^The 1955 Orientation Program started with a big bang Sep­
tember 7 and wijl end with the big push—the traditional push­
ball contest—to be held on the Cut at four thirty, Friday afternoon, 
September 23.
This annual battle between the
sophomores and the freshmen isFrosh Hop
of vital importance to all con­
cerned; if the frosh win, they 
may legally doff their dinks. The 
sophomores then must wear the 
lowly dink as their admission 
ticket to the Frosh-Soph Hop, 
which follows the push-ball 
game on Friday evening, from 
nine o’clock to one. It seems very 
unlikely that the sophomores will 
allow such a misfortune to occur. 
They won the push-ball contest 
last year as freshmen, and stand 
ready to uphold their champion­
ship. The cries ring up among the 
ranks: “Sophomores, defend your 
honor!” and “Freshmen, rally to 
the cause!”
Should the freshmen bow to 
superior sophomore pushing 
p^wer, they will not only have to 
wear their dinks to the Frosh 
Hop as their admission charge, 
but will sport the gray and plaid 
up to and including the day of 
the first Tech football game. 
They will also be required to 
wear them to the Traditions Test 
Failure to do so will result in a 
ten-point deduction from their 
test score.
Orientation Week got under­
way officially on Wednesday, 
September 7, as the Cwens and 
Scimitars greeted nearly 900 
entering students. The pep rally, 
an innovation in the Freshman 
Week program, took place that 
evening, when Mrs. R. L. 
Hackett, Dean of Women, Dr. 
J. N. Graham, Dean of Students, 
and the president of Carnegie 
Tech, Doctor John C. Warner, 
welcomed the entering group in 
the name of Tech and education. 
Cwens and Scimitars and Walt 
Harper’s band welcomed them 
musically with a street dance 
after the pep rally which started 
off to the tune of a lively Bunny 
Hop around the campus.
President Warner formally re­
ceived the entering class at a 
reception on Thursday evening, 
and the Cwens’ party and sca­
venger hunt followed on Friday. 
The weekend’s activities came to 
a climax with the freshman pic­
nic on Saturday. The freshmen 
showed enthusiasm and interest 
in these events, and the Cwens 
report that all of the planned 
activities were well attended. 
(Although the majority of fresh­
men have been cooperative in 
complying with regulations, that 
odd fellow, the dink-less fresh­
man is still being sought out by 
upper-classmen.)
The Orientation Program is 
annually arranged by the sopho­
more men’s honorary, Scimitars, 
with the help of the sophomore 
women’s honorary, Cwens. This 
year presidents Bob Marik and 
Dolores Chidester were in charge.

Second Donner 
Needed To House 
Tech Residents
Included in the larger enroll­
ment this year are about 240 
more students than last year who 
are living on or near Carnegie’s 
campus. Such an increase in 
campus residents indicates that 
more students must be coming 
from farther away or merely that 
more potential commuters are 
realizing the advantages of be­
ing closer to campus activities.
The completion of Donner Hall 
and the subsequent demise of the 
barracks has left Tech with 
housing facilities for approxi­
mately 120 more men than were 
accommodated last fall. Never­
theless, there are nearly 120 new 
students who applied too late to 
get into the dorms. About 50 men 
have been temporarily housed in 
already crowded fraternity 
houses, about 35 freshmen are 
living in rooms near the campus, 
and nearly 30 graduate students 
were forced to seek outside hous­
ing due to the limited facilities 
in the graduate dorms.'Some stu­
dents have not been assigned to 
any definite room as yet.
When it became apparent that 
the rooms would not hold all 
the applicants, Dr. Strick. Co­
ordinator of Student Activities 
end Mr. G. E. Tipker, new Head 
of Men’s Dormitories, advertised 
in the Pittsburgh papers for ac­
commodations. The response was 
gratifying, with about 200 rooms 
for students being found within 
a radius of about 2 miles.
Evidently the problem is con­
fined to the male portion of 
Tech’s populace, with Morewood 
Gardens being full but not over­
loaded with applicants.
Thistle Meeting
There will be a meeting 
for all those interested in 
working on the yearbook 
Wednesday at 5:00 p.m. in 
the Union. Members of the 
staff will meet at 4:30 p.m. 
Wednesday before the gen­
eral meeting.
Traditions Test
Attention, Freshmen! Your 
Traditions Test will be held on 
Tuesday, September twenty-sev­
enth, at eleven-thirty a.m. At­
tendance is required and role will 
be taken. Names of those who 
fail to appear for the test will be 
published in the following week’s 
Tartan. Wearing of dinks to 
the test will be dependent upon 
the outcome of the push-ball 
game. Freshmen are to report to 
take the Traditions Test as fol­
lows:
Freshman men, A thru K re­
port to AH 2210.
Freshman men, L thru Z re­
port to AH 2215.
Fine Arts students report to 
Porter Hall 100.
M.M.C.C. students report to 
Breed Memorial Hall. Scimitars 
and Cwens will proctor the test. 
A re-test will be given for those 
who fail.
TV Station Needs 
Student Helpers 
For Studio Work
WQED, Pittsburgh’s education­
al TV station, began its fall 
schedule on Tuesday, September 
6. Once again the station needs 
college and graduate students 
ot a high caliber to be trained 
for work in the studio. This year 
crews will be smaller than usual 
and each person will be requir­
ed to work 100 hours or one 
semester in the basic training 
course. Students with previous 
experience and those working for 
their second semester will be ad­
vanced individually according to 
their ability. The program stu­
dents will be graded daily on 
their work, for college credit.
Studio volunteers will be 
needed from 2 p.m. until 11, 
Monday through Friday. There 
will be two shifts a day—(1) 
from 2 p.m. until 8:30, with an 
hour off for supper (2) from 6 
p.m. until 10:30 or 11. There 
will be three openings for crew 
members on each shift for the 
following jobs: (a) assistant
floor manager, (b) scenery and 
props, (c) lighting and cable 
pulling. Each crew member will 
be thoroughly, trained in the 
above jobs by the floor manager 
in charge.
This fall volunteer artists will 
be needed to work at the studio 
under the supervision of the 
new full-time art director. Art 
students can obtain some in­
struction and experience in 
everything from graphic art to 
set design.
Registration is now open for 
fall work at WQED, 4337 Fifth 
Avenue.

thus take a more active part in 
these extra curricular activities.

ONCE MORE UNTO THE BREACH
Today I begin my second year of writing this column for 
Philip Morris Cigarettes. Once every week during the coming 
school year I will take up, without fear or favor, issues that 
inflame the minds and quicken the hearts of college students 
everywhere. I will grapple with such knotty questions as: “Is 
^mpulsory attendance the reflection of an insecure faculty?” 
and “Is the unmarried student obsolete?” and “Are room-mates 
sanitary?”
While each week I make a bold assault upon these burning 
issues, I will also attempt to beguile you into smoking Philip 
Morris Cigarettes. Into each column I will craftily weave some
words in praise of Philip 
Morris. I will extol, ob­
liquely, the benign mild­
ness of Philip Morris’s 
well-born tobacco, its 
soothing fragrance, its 
tonic freshness, its docile 
temperateness, its oh-so- 
welcome gentleness in this 
spiky and abrasive world 
of ours.
For saying these kind 
things about their ciga­
rettes, the Philip Morris 
Company will pay me 
money. This is the Ameri­
can Way. This is De­
mocracy. This is Enlight­
ened Self Interest. This 
is the System that .Made 
Our Country Great, and anybody who doesn’t like it is 
MALADJUSTED.
Perhaps it would be well in this first column of the year to 
tell you a little about myself. I am 36 years of age, but still 
remarkably active. I am squat, moon-faced, have all my teeth,
and am fond of folk dancing and Lotto. My hobby is collecting
mucilage.
I first took up writing because I was too short to steal. Bare­
foot Boy With Cheek was my maiden effort, and today, fourteen 
years later, I continue to 
write about college students.
This is called “arrested de­
velopment.”
But I can’t help it.
Though I am now in the 
winter of my life, the prob­
lems of undergraduates still 
seem to me as pressing as 
ever. How to pursue a blaz­
ing romance with exams 
coming up next Friday in 
physics, history and French; 
how to convince your stingy 
father that life is a bitter 
mockery without a yellow 
convertible; how to subsist 
on dormitory food — these 
remain the topics that roil 
my sluggish blood.

Interfraternity 
Horseplay Incited 
By Tech Coeds
Last Saturday afternoon found 
j Tech fraternity men and coeds 
as lively as ever, despite the 
summer layoff, as they battled 
j for possession of a large yellow 
! and blue banner belonging to 
j Alpha Tau Omega fraternity. 
Stolen originally by pledges and i given to freshman women who 
were too timid to display the 
! prized possession, the flag fell 
into the hands of some upper- 
class women, and a short time 
later it was floating from the 
sixth floor of Morewood Gardens.
Powerless, the ATO’s who were 
assembled in the driveway be­
low watched their banner dis­
appear and reappear flying from 
the roof. Soon after its disap­
pearance from that point, female

Kiltie Band Director
Mr. George Reynolds is Tech’s new Kiltie Band director. He 
comes to Tech from the University of Illinois, where he was pur­
suing graduate study for his Ph.D. While at Illinois, he played 
solo trumpet in the outstanding Illinois Concert Band and taught
in a nearby school which was a+---------------——----------------------------- 
first division winner for three
years in the illinois state con­
test.
Before attending University of
accomplices of Pi Kappa Alpha 
fraternity contrived to get pos­
session of it and throw it out the 
window. The ground recipient 
was immediately mobbed and re­
lieved of his prize.
But all this served as only the 
beginning of a battle royal, as 
within ten minutes» the ATO’s 
and PiKA’s were engage«! in a 
fierce water battle which soon 
included four or five other fra­
ternities. Such horseplay is not 
uncommon, but unusual so early

Illinois, Mr. Reynolds was direc­
tor of instrumental music at the 
University of New Hampshire. 
Here he developed a symphony 
orchestra and two bands. He also 
helped organize the New Hamp­
shire State Symphony, playing 
first trumpet with this organiza­
tion.
The Kilties, under Mr. Reyn­
olds, played at the freshman con­
cert a week ago. In the future 
the band will entertain at most of 
Tech’s football games, as well as 
in winter and spring concerts.

Pagre 4—CARNEGIE TARTAN—Tuesday, September 20, 1955
Editorial—-
Make Room For Activities 
In Your Schedule
In the hope that some few who are not already inured 
to these editorials will by chance read this one, we are 
directing it primarily to those who are new at our be­
loved institution. Now that the annually-recurring bed­
lam, confusion, and clamor associated with the first eight 
days of one’s existence at Tech has subsided into the 
somewhat less exotic routine of daily classes and home­
work, we can hope to calmly and rationally take a peek 
at the future.
Of course, Rush Week, the name by which this semi- 
barbaric period is known in polite circles, has left us, fresh­
men and upperclassmen alike, in a state of physical ex­
haustion from which we will probably not recover until 
sometime shortly before the start of the second semester. 
Before then though, someone should say something about 
what Carnegie Tech has to offer us, in addition to blood­
shot eyes, fraternity parties, (no connection intended) and 
schoolwork ad infinitum.
As you may or may not have discovered by now, 
there are a multitude of extra-curricular activities exist­
ing on campus, and they almost all have something to 
offer to us in the way of a so-called “broad education.” 
Many people feel that every student should devote some 
of his time to at least one of these activities, to assure 
himself that at the end of four years he will have learned 
a little more than just the offerings of the curriculum.
At the termination of classes every day, some people 
go into seclusion in their dorm rooms, emerging only for 
the next day’s classes. Others attend Tech in much the 
same manner as they would a job. They report for duty 
in the morning and rush home as soon as possible in the 
afternoon, not caring to take part in any campus activi­
ties. Such people are perhaps getting the most from their 
academic work, but they certainly are not availing them­
selves of the opportunities offered by Carnegie Tech.
You probably have already received too much advice 
to digest on how to get the most out of Carnegie Tech, 
college life in general, etc. Our intention is not to confuse 
you with more advice but merely to set you thinking 
about what course you want to follow during your ex­
istence at Tech.
We believe a certain amount of time should be devoted 
to extra-curricular activities in order to avoid an over­
balance of development in technical studies. Industry 
wants people who are not afraid of other people and who 
know how to communicate their ideas. With this in mind, 
the Carnegie Plan of education was put into action. (In­
cidentally, this much-discussed but little-read piece of 
literature can be found in its entirety in the back of the 
E & S catalog.) But even the Carnegie Plan cannot create 
interest in activities. That has to come from students who 
want to be active in them.
Much is done by these organizations at the beginning 
of the semester to attract new members. In fact the new 
student is often hopelessly confused by the seemingly 
endless and intricate maze of organizations. The secret 
is to choose wisely and to try not to get into everything. 
There are some people at this extreme who are in every 
activity and organization and who cannot devote the 
proper attention to schoolwork. Each newcomer to Tech 
has to decide for himself how to apportion his time among 
his interests.

Buhl Planetarium
Visitors to Buhl Planetarium 
will travel in spirit back to rural 
America of the Gay Nineties 
when they visit the Memory 
Lane .exhibit. Memory Lane, an 
animated model of a typcial 
Western Pennsylvania village of 
the 1890’s, was cx-eated especially 
for the Planetarium by Charles 
Bowdish of Brookville, Pennsyl­
vania, creator of many famous 
miniature scenes that have won 
national recognition. Covering an 
area of 360 square feet, and en­
tirely hand-craft in exquisite 
detail, the exhibit presents a 
drama of rural life, as the span 
of a day unfolds. Music and 
sounds from real life, combined 
with intricate lighting effects, 
change the scene from evening, 
through the night, and on to 
dawn and the start of a new day.
The current sky show at the 
Planetarium star theater is “Life 
on Other Worlds,” a show that 
presents the latest discoveries 
concerning the habitability of the 
other planets of our solar system 
and also concerning the likeli­
hood of there being many other 
planets inhabited by intelligent 
forms of life.
One of eight evening courses 
offered by the Planetarium is 
“Understanding the Far East,” a 
course which provides the geo­
graphic background essential to 
a n appraisal o f international 
affairs. This will be offered on 
Wednesday evening. “Popular 
Electronics,” a course taught on 
Monday evenings by Francis T. 
Thompson, Research Engineer 
for Westinghouse, is designed to 
interest laymen — particularly 
radio, television, and hi-fi fans. 
Also scheduled are photography 
courses which cover many phases 
of that popular hobby, and all 
instructed by professional cam­
eramen. Reservation for these 
courses can be made by telephon­
ing the Planetarium at FAirfax 
1-4300.
WQED
Plans for an experimental tele­
vision series of “America’s Town 
Meeting” to originate from the 
studios of Educational Television 
Station WQED were announced 
by station officials recently in a 
simulcast launching WQED’s 1955 
Campaign for Operating Funds 
on Channels 2 and 13.
Secretary of Labor James P. 
Mitchell will be the lead-off guest 
for the series, which will be 
telecast Sunday, September 25 
from 7 to 8 at the station’s head­
quarters in Oakland. Washing­
ton commentator Gunnar Back 
will be the moderator.
Departing from its /regular 
radio format, the TV version of 
“Town Meeting” will combine in­
formal discussion — not neces­
sarily debate—with a variety of 
documentary techniques. The 
September 25 telecast will open 
with a brief account of the his­
tory and functions of the De­
partment of Labor, after which 
Secretary Mitchell will report on 
problems currently "being faced 
by him and his staff. He will 
then be questioned by guest in­
terrogators, representing both la­
bor and management, as well as 
by an audience of Pittsburgh 
citizens.
Playhouse
The fall term of the Pittsburgh 
Playhouse School of the Theater 
got underway on September 19. 
Under the direction of Mark 
Lewis, who assumed the head 
position last June, the Playhouse 
is planning an expansion of 
activities.
Already established as one of 
the outstanding Theater Schools 
in the country, the Playhouse 
School now offers a two year 
comprehensive course leading to 
a certificate. The second year of 
training is tuition-free and is 
available to first year graduates 
or to students with previous 
training. This year the school
Letters
The column “Letters to the Editors” which normally appears 
on this page was omitted this week due mainly to the fact that 
we have received no letters to date. Anyone wishing to express 
his opinion on some issue or call something to the attention of 
the .campus, is most cordially invited to send a letter to the 
Tartan. This may be done through Intraschool Mail. Anony­
mous letters are not published, but the author’s name will be 
withheld upon request.
Over The 
Skibo Table
By Joseph A. Szewc
Welcome once again to Car­
negie Tech. Carnegie Tech, where 
a cup of coffee still only costs a 
nickel and motorcycle trees 
bloom in the Spring time. Where 
bridge is still the favorite card 
game and Bermuda shorts are 
slowly creeping into our society. 
Life itself h^s now slowed t<3 its 
abnormal hectic pace since rush 
week is over and no longer are 
the girls partially confused or 
the men completely bewildered 
by the fraternity men. The in­
structors are now taking over 
and doing an admirable job in 
teaching and confusing everyone. 
A sophomore once said that the 
first thing he had learned at Tech 
was how much he didn’t know. 
How very true this is. For a man 
that thinks he knows everything 
is a fool or an idiot, and a person 
cart only attempt to seek knowl­
edge if he is convinced that there 
is knowledge to be sought.
* * *
Dean Hackett certainly must 
be praised and congratulated for 
her revision of late hours for the 
girls on Friday night. For years 
the girls' have been screaming, 
“If we only could come and go 
like the men, and could be treat­
ed like grown-ups rather than 
children we'd all be much hap­
pier.” So our hats are off to the 
Dean for a great experiment.
¦* * *
The Pittsburgh Sun Tele­
graph’s charge of bigotry and 
predjudism against the fratern­
ities in general and Delta Tau 
Delta at Allegheny College in 
particular were made a little 
ridiculous when the Delts’ na­
tional governing body permitted 
the Allegheny chapter to keep 
their two social members. The 
whole stink was, or so the paper 
presumed, over the fact that one 
of the social members was Jew­
ish and this was the whole reason 
for the sortie.
* * *
This is not entirely true. I have 
been told that the reason for the 
quick scare thrown into the Delt 
chapter was not because of the 
social members being Jewish and 
Catholic but rather because they 
were attending the fraternity’s 
meetings (Delta Tau Delta is a 
secret organization) while not 
being initiated members. It would 
do well for some people to check 
the privileges granted to social 
members of a fraternity before 
crying “Wolf!”
* * *
As a slight sideline here, we 
might add that one of the Social 
members at Allegheny is a for­
mer Tech student, Ed Eld. Ed is a 
Phi Kap, initiated here at Rho 
Chapter in the spring of 1953 and 
transferred to Allegheny in the 
fall of 1954. A close friend of 
yours truly, I’m sure Ed has had 
quite a kick from the big to do 
made about him and his Jewish 
friend.* * *

Tech Eleven Starts Practice; 
Freshmen Crop Looks Good
The Tech Bowl once again* 
hums- with the sounds of foot­
ball practice. This year coach 
Eddie Baker started practice on 
Tuesday, September 6. allowing 
the team three weeks to practice 
before the opening game with 
Lafayette, at Forbes Field.
Approximately 40 men report­
ed for practice this year, and 
among these are only nine re­
turning lettermen. Coach Baker 
and his assistants have a job on 
their hands trying to find re­
mplacements for such stalwarts as 
halfbacks Eddie Miller and Bill 
Kennedy, Quarterback Phil 
Jeske, center A1 Schell, tackle 
John McCarthy, and guard John 
Williamson. Sixteen other play­
ers from last year’s squad are 
also missing, leaving Baker with 
a skeleton of the undefeated 
and once tied, 1954 squad.
The major problem this year 
lies in replacing most of the for­
ward wall., John Kohan, a soph­
omore metallurgist, is expected 
to fill the spot left vacant by 
the graduation of 60 minute 
man A1 Schell. A1 Tagliavini, a 
sophomore P & D, looks like a 
good man to take over the guard 
position left open by the loss of 
big John Williamson. Tagliavini 
weighs 185, stands 5’-10” and 
is very rugged.
Doctor Baker is also looking 
forward to filling in some of these 
spots with some of the promis­
ing freshmen that turned out for 
practice. Bill Adams, Earl Ben­
ner, Bob Hammer, Dave Love, 
and Walter Majeski are good bets 
for regular positions.
Backfield Stronger Than Line
The backfield problem is not 
so acute, John Tucci looks like 
the boy who will be the field 
general for the Tartans. Tucci 
saw some action last year as 
understudy to Phil Jeske. His 
great passing arm should prove 
a threat to the opposition. He is 
best remembered for his touch-

niques of good blocking. Coach Eddie Baker is looking to some 
of these men to fill key positions in the line.
down pass in the last seconds of 
the first half of the Lehigh 
which tied the score and thus 
enabled the Tartans to keep their 
record clean. Another promising 
quarterback by the name of Bill 
Adams is keeping* Tucci on his 
toes as the two boys vie for the 
starting position.
Returning halfbacks, Tom 
Briner and Frank Smith are 
fighting it out for Eddie Miller’s 
position at left half. Both boys 
saw action last year as Miller’s 
replacements and both* show 
promise of having a good season 
this year. Marshall Brown and 
Roy DeVries look like a sure 
thing to fill in the rest of the 
backfield and both boys are ex­
pected to be stalwarts on this 
year’s team.
Carnegie Tech opens the sea­
son with Lafayette at Forbes 
Field on October 1.

The Tartans of Carnegie Tech 
have, for the past five or six 
seasons, held a dominant position 
in local cross-country circles. 
Under the late great Guy Hal- 
ferty, Tech piled up an amazing 
string of victories and Tri-State 
championships with such stars 
as Mai Gillies, Hap MacDonald, 
Arnie Olds, and our present 
coach, and probably Tech’s most 
popular and well-known thin- 
clad, Bob Carman.
The squad this year is not 
blessed with one really great 
individual star, but Coach Car­
men has a squad possessed with 
team spirit and enthusiasm that 
is going to send the harriers into 
another successful season. Con­
trary to popular belief, cross­
country teams are made of men 
who can finish in a bunch, that 
can place high in the first ten 
spots. This year’s squad, cap­
tained by Jim Flynn, victim of 
three years in the thinclad wars, 
is made up of just such a group.
Bill Bryant, a junior metallurg­
ical engineer from Monaca, Pa., 
is back after his letter-winning 
sophomore season, as is Ry Whit­
ney, sophomore metallurgical en­
gineer from Swisenville. This 
gives the Skibos three returning 
lettermen as well as Larry 
Bryant, twin brother of Bill, who 
last year became number one 
two-miler here at Tech and is 
undoubtedly going to be one of 
Tech’s finest harriers. These four 
men, plus three highly prospec­
tive freshmen, give the Tartans 
a well-balanced though young 
team, which will furnish Bob 
Carman with a winning team 
with good possibilities of captur­
ing the Tri-State crown.
Student participation as spec­
tators has always been poor al­
though Carnegie has perennially 
been one of the finest teams here­
abouts. The staff of the Tartan 
and the team hopes that students 
will take a greater interest in 
their thinclads, especially since

When you need a quick sprint for 
safer passing, this V8 delivers!
It’s pure dynamite, and you have to 
go way, way up the price ladder 
before you ever find its equal.
The proof was burned into the sands of 
Daytona Beach at the NASCAR* trials 
earlier this year. In acceleration tests, 
Chevrolet walked away from everything 
else in its field. Plus all the high-priced 
cars except one!
It’s the big reason Chevrolet’s been tak­
ing all comers in short track stock car 
events this season. Sizzling acceleration 
along with handling ease and cornering 
ability—tilings that mean safer, happier

very active in varsity sports. 
After two years in the infantry, 
he enrolled in the University of 
Miami (Florida). While in school, 
he was very active both in var­
sity and intrumural sports. He 
lettered twice in both varsity 
fcotball and baseball, was man­
ager of the Phys. Ed. club, 
coached IM basketball and touch 
football. Bob was also president 
of University of Miami’s Physical 
Education Majors Club. While in

Assistant Professor Earl J. Birdy, Jr., a graduate of Pitts«

rector of Intramural Athletics at Carnegie Tech. Mr. Birdy is 
filling the position vacated by Mr. David See, who has gone

lege where he will teach physical 
education and coach soccer and 
wrestling.
Upon graduation in 1944 from 
Peabody High School Mr. Birdy 
entered the Marine Corps. Dur­
ing his twTo years tour of duty 
he was stationed in Guam and 
China. Following his discharge 
from the marines, Prof. Birdy 
studied at Slippery Rock State 
Teachers’ College, where he ’was 
active in intramurals and varsity 
athletics. In 1950 he received his 
B.S. in Health and Physical Edu­
cation and started his first job as 
an instructor for the Pittsburgh 
Public School System.
Birdy came to Tech in 1951 as 
an instructor in physical educa­
tion and swimming and assistant 
to Prof. Haynes in the intramural 
department. Since his arrival at 
Tech, Mr. Birdy has been kept

Grants and Awards
Air Force Grant
The U.S. Air Force has grant­
ed a $30,000 contract t6 Car­
negie Tech for studies in the 
heat treatment of titanium- 
chromium alloys. These studies 
are part of a large Air Force 
program to learn the funda­
mental characteristics of titan­
ium alloys and determine their 
suitability as aircraft metals. Ti­
tanium is a metal possessing an 
unusual combination of light­
ness and strength.
The investigation at Tech is 
being carried out by Dr. Cyril 
Wells, principal research engi­
neer, and Dr. Hubert Aaronson, 
both of the Metals Research 
Laboratory.
Results of this research may 
ultimately permit more effec­
tive utilization of titanium in 
building America’s newest su­
personic jet aircraft.
Mathematics Grant
The U.S. Department of De­
fense has extended two research 
grant to the Carnegie Tech de­
partment of mathematics.
The larger grant, $31,388, was 
given by Army Ordnance for an 
overall mathematical analysis of 
electrical and mechanical sys­
tems. Research will be conduct­
ed under the direction of Pro­
fessors A. E. Heins and R. J. 
Duffin.
The U.S. Air Force extended 
$6075 for research into the 
theory of various transformations 
in the analysis of variance. This 
project will be conducted under 
direction of Professor Edwin G. 
Olds.
Metallurgy Grant
The Metals Research Labora­
tory at Carnegie Tech has re­
ceived a $9000 research grant 
from the U.S. Army Ordnance 
Corps to study spiral growth 
during vapor deposition of met­
als.
The study will be conducted 
under the direction of Professor 
Robert F. Mehl, head of the 
Metals Research Laboratory and 
the Carnegie Tech department 
or metallurgy.
Electric Machine Grant
The National Science Founda­
tion has made a rare grant of 
$15,000 to Dr. Leo A. Finzi, pro­
fessor of electrical engineering 
at Carnegie Tech. Earmarked 
for research in electrical ma­
chinery, the grant is the only 
one of its kind in the United 
States.*Since 1953, the founda­
tion has 'extended only three 
electrical engineering grants in 
this country.
Dr. Finzi is Buhl professor at 
Carnegie Tech and last year 
was chosen to receive the Car­
negie Teaching Award. He is 
an international authority on 
magnetic amplifiers and electri­
cal power and machinery.
* Fulbright Award
A Fulbright Award for a 
year’s assignment in France has 
been granted to Professor Doris 
Myers, of the department 'of 
home economics.
During the academic year 
1955-1956, Professor Myers will 
participate in planning and de­
veloping an institute of higher 
education in home economics. 
Principally she will work on 
curriculum and program devel­
opment. The project is an out­
growth of an international sem­
inar held in Paris last year on 
the subject of “Education and 
the Problems of Daily Living.” 
The seminar served to point out 
the need for teachers who could 
assume leadership in selecting, 
coordinating and applying as­
pects of the arts and sciences to 
the problems of daily living.

as official scientific advisor to 
the federal government. The 
National Research Council is an 
instrument of the National Acad­
emy used to bring the most com­
petent scientists and engineers
of the country together in order 
to deal most effectively witn 
scientific problems and to ex­
change information to further 
research in the interest of the 
United States.
At Tech, Dr. Rossini is Silli- 
man professor, head of the de­
partment of chemistry and Di­
rector of the Petroleum Re­
search Laboratory.

metal and alloys, formation of 
ferrite and bainite from auten- 
ite, the pearlite-austenite reac­
tion, and the growth of metal 
crystals from metal vapor.
He will also tour Europe, vis­
iting universities and research 
laboratories in France, Ger­
many, Holland, Norway and 
Sweden.
Research Fellowships
James G. March, assistant 
professor in the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration was 
granted a year’s leave of absence 
to study at the Center for Ad­
vanced Study in the Behavioral
science at Stanford, California. 
Mr. March will spend a year at 
the Center, working individually 
and with fellows chosen from a 
dozen different fields. Their ob­
ject will be to perfect research 
techniques and explore new ideas 
for the improvement of behavior­
al research and training.

Enrollment—
[Continued from Page 1] 
72 advanced students could be 
admitted to E&S. Only one out 
of every six freshman appli­
cants was accepted.
College Boards Used 
To make a fair selection, all 
applicants were required to take 
the College Board examinations 
for the first time since the peak 
year of 1947-48, when we had 
3,972 students. Following the ex­
ams. each prospective student 
was personally interviewed. 
“This provides the faii'est means 
of selection,” Dr. Daniels stated. 
“The process enables us to make 
the fairest and best selection for 
the student and for ourselves. 
On the whole, we have reason 
to believe that this year’s new 
students are the best crop in re­
cent year.” -
Approximately 90 per cent of 
the 2500 applicants in Engineer­
ing and Science applied for schol­
arships. A total of 90 engineering 
and science freshman scholar­
ships awards, valued at $51,000, 
were granted for the 1955-56 
year. This means that only one 
scholarship was actually granted 
for every 25 applications.
P&D Grows By 60 
Total undergraduate enroll­
ment in the colleges of Engineer­
ing and Science this year will be 
approximately 1640, as compared 
with last year’s 1538. There are 
also about 300 graduate students 
enrolled who will be studying 
for Masters and Doctors degrees.
Freshman applications in the 
College of Fine Arts this year 
numbered 547, which is 25 per 
cent above the 432 received last 
year. Two hundred new appli­
cants were accepted as against 
143 for the previous year. The in­
crease was made possible by ex­
pansion in the department of 
painting and design. Sixty new 
students were enrolled in this 
department. The departments of 
drama, music, and architecture 
were not able to accept any more 
students than in previous years. 
The increase in painting and de­
sign students boosted the total 
College of Fine Arts enrollment 
to approximately 600 full-time 
students. Scholarships totaling 
$7570 were awarded to 18 fresh­
men.
Printing School Expands
In the School of Printing Man­
agement, 180 new applicants were 
received, 85 more than last year. 
Firty new students, ten more 
than the previous year were ac­
cepted. The 20 per cent increase 
is in line with the Printing Man­
agement School’s program of 
expansion.
Expansion in the School of 
Printing Management has been 
anticipated by the faculty since 
Carnegie Tech is the only major 
institution with a full graphic 
arts division. Four new curricula 
options have been announced for 
this year and the school will con­
tinue to increase the number of 
new students admitted. Although 
women are now eligible for ad­
mission none have been accepted 
so far this year. Three freshmen 
received scholarships whose 
value totaled $1880.
Applications and enrollments 
at Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
College and the Graduate School 
of I n d u s t rial Administration 
were approximately the same as 
the previous year. There were 21 
scholarships valued at $5770 
awarded to Margaret Morrison 
freshmen.
