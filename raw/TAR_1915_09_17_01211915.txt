PLAID Will ATTEMPT 
TO REDEEM ITSELF
In a hard-fought contest on Carnegie’s 
floor last Thursday night Juniata’s fast 
basketball team overcame the Plaid by 
the score of 38 to 26. Juniata’s team 
played as good basketball as will prob­
ably be seen on Carnegie’s floor this sea­
son. They were quick, good at carrying 
the ball, and made shots from all cor­
ners of the floor, which thrilled the spec­
tators. The excitement was great, from 
start to finish, and the game an excel­
lent one to watch.
Carnegie was at her best in the first 
half and made things look pretty dark 
for her opponents. Nevertheless, the 
half ended with Juniata in the lead by 
two baskets.
In the second half Juniata kept up her 
fast pace and finally outdistanced the 
Plaid. Carnegie caged the first basket 
and began the half in good style, but 
was unable to keep up with their oppon­
ents. During the earlier part of the 
half the home team shot three baskets, 
but aside from these they were unable 
to acquire any more field goals, the re­
maining of their points being made by 
fouls. Juniata guarded very closely and 
as a result the Plaid seemed unable to 
get within range of the basket during 
the latter part of the game. Carnegie 
must be given considerable credit, how­
ever, for they, too, guarded closely and 
Juniata likewise did a great part of her 
scoring on fouls.
The individual star of the game was 
Bigler, the visitors’ right forward. He 
was good at taking the ball up the floor 
but especially excellent at shooting. His 
shots were all long and accurate and 
made from difficult angles. He made 
eight baskets for his team. Captain 
Hines of Carnegie played a pretty game 
and cleverly blocked a number of Juni­
ata’s shots beside caging a couple of field 
goals and shooting six out of seven 
fouls. Slater, at left forward for the 
Plaid, played aggressively and did some 
good foul shooting, while Fees of Juni­
ata also played a brilliant game.
Thy,P obvJc
The game opened with a series of 
fouls. Slater dropped in three and Fees 
one. Bigler popped in a basket. Slater 
shot a foul. Bigler tossed another bas­
ket and Slater made a field goal by a 
beautiful shot. Fees shot a foul which 
was followed by a basket by Hines and 
a foul by Slater. Bigler made a pretty 
shot and caged another goal. Fees shot 
a foul and then tossed a field goal. Big­
ler made another score. Six fouls, three 
by Slater and three by Fees, ended the

The plans and specifications for the 
two wings to the north and south end 
of the Design building are now being 
rushed to completion with the hope of 
commencing actual construction work 
this spring. Mr. Hornbostel is person­
ally supervising the work and is em­
bodying into the design original features 
that will add to the efficiency and also 
to the present interior and exterior 
beauty of the building.
As in former days, the building bureau 
in which the present plans and all pre­
vious designs of our buildings have ori­
ginated, is a scene of laborious activity 
and complete disorder, caused by the 
feverish haste of the consulting archi­
tects, Chalfant and Steen, the old stand- 
byes and of White Friar fame, and the 
latter additions to the force, Smith, Boy­
er, Allison, Griffith and “Red” Hatcher, 
the football star. Directing the efforts 
of this impressive group of pencil push­
ers is the genial Scotty, Mr. Horn- 
bostel’s assistant designer. The never 
sober face of “Red” Jones is missed, 
however, with his abundant fund of par­
lor songs and stories. One cannot but 
be impressed by the steady hum of in­
dustry which is heard outside as well as 
by the important bearing of the person, 
posing as a stenographer, who guards 
the entrance to the draughting room.
As now contemplated, the elevations 
of the wings will correspond in style 
with the building as it now stands, com­
pleting the present court and extending 
the roof line. Both the north and south 
elevations have been designed to use a 
maximum amount of the very excellent 
light. Balconies, on the second floor, 
overlooking the campus, accent the de­
sign of both the north and south fronts. 
The western face of the building will 
play up to full extent the feature of the 
niches.
On the right of the street entrance in 
the north wing will be the sculpture hall, 
one of the masterpieces of the building. 
It will be finished in brick and stone 
with a decorated ceiling. On one side 
will be large windows to take full ad­
vantage of the north light and on the 
other an arcade rendered from a cloister 
in the church of St. Jean de Latran at 
Rome. Opposite the entrance on the 
west wall will be an unique feature in 
the form of an altar with a flaming 
front. The walls will be faced with 
medallions and other Byzantine orna­
ments.
The remainder of the basement will 
be used for locker rooms, and under 
the stage storage rooms for the scenery 
and properties.
There will be monumental termina­
tions for the main hall'of the first floor, 
which will be provided with terra cotta 
benches along the walls. The new li­
brary will be situated behind the present 
exhibition hall opening into which there 
will be large windows. The walls will 
be paneled and the ceiling will be a gor­
geous composition of the pattern of a 
Persian Rug. In the south wing the 
stage will be extended the full depth, giv­
ing a total of 52 feet. Adjoining this 
will be property rooms and a rehearsing 
stage of the size of the one used at 
present, with a lecture hall attached. 
The remainder of the floor will be used 
for class rooms.
On the mezzanine floor will be situ­
ated some thirty class and practice 
rooms and also store rooms for musical 
instruments and costumes. Two large 
dressing rooms will be provided as well.
The full north wing of the second 
floor will be occupied with a large 
draughting room and accessories. The 
lighting arrangements will be excellent. 
In the south wing will be two large 
class rooms and above on the third floor, 
a large draughting room and a studio 
which will extend through two floors to 
the roof, thus providing a large wall 
space for mural paintings. In the north 
wing of the third floor will be two large 
and two small studios designed as at 
present. The fourth floor will contain 
a large painters’ lodge and several 
smaller studios.
Of especial interest to the over-exer- 
cised students in the building will be the 
fact that there will be an elevator in 
each wing. Large mirrors with accom­
panying make-up apparatus will be pro­
vided for the girls on the landings. 
Tete-a-tete booths under proper chaper- 
onage have also been arranged for in or­
der to do away with the present obnox­
ious habit of couples congregating on the 
stairways. A barber shop manned by 
Sophomores will be attached to the 
draughting room for the benefit of the 
Plebes.

Owing to a large amount of extra 
work which has suddenly arisen in the 
department of student health, Dr. 
Marks has felt it necessary to resign 
as coach to the basketball team. The 
amount of time demanded by his 
other work woidd in the future pre­
vent him from accompanying the team 
on any of the trips and from giving 
the required amount of time to coach­
ing. A successor has not yet been 
decided upon.

This Saturday night at the Field 
House, Tech’s basketball five meets 
the team representing Gettysburg Col­
lege. Little is known about our op­
ponents, but they are said to possess 
a large, fast team, and a hard game 
is anticipated. A dance will follow 
the contest.
Last week proved one of the most 
disastrous ever encountered by a Tech 
floor aggregation. We lost three 
games in three successive nights. 
Juniata defeated us, 38-26, by a won­
derful display of shooting ability at 
a long range. Time and again, Hines 
missed shots that rolled around the 
basket and then fell out. We seemed 
to have no luck at all. On the fol­
lowing night Marietta defeated Tech 
by a 28-14 score. The team gave a 
poor display of basketball, and while 
no alibi is to be offered for the poor 
showing, the following facts stand 
out prominently:
1. Douthett and Coach Marks were 
unable to make the trip.
2. The team was exhausted when 
it entered the game, after having trav­
eled seven hours on the “B. & O.” 
They arrived in Marietta at 7:45, and 
were on the playing floor at 8:30 
without having eaten a single thing 
since twelve o’clock that day.

There is no more pleasant news to 
report this week than the return to 
school of Capt. Haselton of the track 
team. For the last seven months, 
Haselton has been recovering from 
the unfortunate injury he received 
last spring, but like the renowned 
battle-scarred musician who appeared 
in this city not long ago, he returns 
with only a slight limp to remind 
us of his mishap. We’re mighty glad 
to have you with us again, “Hasie,” 
and we welcome you in the name of 
the entire student body.

In direct contrast to the splendid 
showing made by the football eleven 
last fall, the record of the basketball 
team is likely to be a very poor one, 
if the results of the first five games 
offer any indications for the remain­
ing part of the season. There may 
be a number of reasons assigned for 
this unexpected slump, but the real 
cause, in our opinion, is the lack of 
support by the authorities responsible 
for Carnegie’s athletic teams. On the 
recent trip to Marietta and Mus­
kingum colleges, the Plaid five was un­
accompanied by its coach, whom we 
are told could not be spared from his 
other duties. This statement casts 
no reflection on Dr. Marks, who, on 
the contrary, deserves much praise 
and credit. During the past three 
years he has occupied his present po­
sition as basketball coach without any 
remuneration for the services he has
so willingly rendered. When we re­
call the unusual efforts made to 
strengthen and improve the football 
team, it seems a trifle inconsistent to 
exert on the activity immediately suc­
ceeding the gridiron game what 
amounts almost to a negative influ­
ence detracting from rather than aid­
ing the basketball situation. Foot­
ball should receive more attention 
than basketball, but the latter as well 
as every other form of sport, is due 
its proportionate recognition.

Two cases of illness in the student 
body in the past week bring forth food 
for reflection the effect of which 
should be valuable.
One is a case of pneumonia, the 
other, a case of appendicitis. The first 
case developed with great rapidity, the 
patient being up and about on Sunday 
night, and very ill with a temperature 
of 105 and pneumonia involving both 
lungs on the following evening. In­
teresting light is thrown on this case 
by the information that for a full week 
previous to the incipiency of the di­
sease, the patient had felt greatly ex­
hausted and had daily thrown him­
self on his bed as soon as his school 
work was over. He never mentioned 
this condition to the physician nor to 
any one who could have advised him.
I have no intention to claim that had 
he done so, he would have avoided 
pneumonia, but merely to suggest 
that he might. There were eight days 
of expectancy on the part of his or­
ganism, eight days during which a 
conflict was apparently taking place 
between his resistance and an infec­
tion, and, although no positive signs 
as to the quality of the disease might 
have been ascertained by a physician, 
such simple expectant advice as rest 
in bed for a day or two and a purga­
tive might have altered the ultimate.
The second case, appendicitis, was 
suffered by a student who was oper­
ated upon and was on a fair way to 
recovery long before the health au­
thorities had any knowledge of any 
illness. It started before the Christ­
mas recess. Suppose that instead of 
being a case of appendicitis the case 
had been scarlet fever or diphtheria 
or any other communicable disease? 
Lack of information would have pre­
vented the health authorities from tak­
ing any precautionary measures of dis­
infection during the recess, and there 
might have been an epidemic after 
the vacation which, besides enforcing 
cessation of school for six weeks, 
might have caused the contamination 
of a score of students.
Both cases, therefore, emphasize the 
necessity on the part of the student 
body to obey the regulations of the 
health department and to follow the 
hygienic precepts which are con­
stantly brought to its attention. No 
indisposition is insignificant enough 
to be overlooked with contempt. The 
proverb claiming that one ounce of 
prevention is better than sixteen 
pounds of cure is truer today than 
fifty years ago because we know more 
about prevention now. Preventive
medicine is the medicine of the day 
and we can make it yield its best pos­
sibilities at Carnegie Tech as well as 
anywhere else only through coopera­
tion.
And while on this subject it may 
not be amiss to mention anew the fact 
that “no student can graduate from 
the schools who does not earn Credit 
in Health.” This means besides 
credit at examinations on lecture 
work, credit for medical and physical 
examinations, credit for gymnastics 
and compliance with all the regula­
tion the enforcing of which has been 
deemed necessary by the authorities 
and this includes the reporting of any 
cases of illness just as quickly as it 
occurs.

Editor of the Tartan,
Dear Sir:
The recent discussion concerning 
the publication of the scientific jour­
nal in these schools has ended in a 
way that should please every student 
here. Each man can readily realize 
the direct benefit to himself which 
will result from the distribution of 
this publication. The reputation of a 
school, and consequently the recep­
tion of its graduates, rests almost en­
tirely with its faculty, alumni, and 
equipment. There are numerous ways 
in which this information is carried 
to the public, but the Journal can fur­
nish a direct and efficient means.
In introducing the speaker at a re­
cent general lecture, Director Ham- 
merschlag said we little realized 
that many of the members of our fac­
ulty were men of wide reputations 
who could give us much valuable and 
interesting information upon matters 
for which there is little time during 
the regular courses. The Journal can 
furnish a means of conveying this in­
formation to the students and persons 
not connected with the school. It 
will advertise, if I may use that word, 
the kind of men who are engaged in 
preparing the students for active 
work.
Anyone who has heard such men 
as Mr. Bickely, C. I. T. ’09, who read 
a paper before the Carnegie Student 
Branch of the American Society of 
Mechanical Engineers at their recent 
meeting, knows that the schools have 
sent out men who have shown them­
selves capable in various fields of 
work. The Journal can make this 
fact more generally known. It can 
fill a large educational place by pub­
lishing papers on recent practical 
work which they have been engaged 
in. Students will be benefitted both 
by the information and by the reputa­
tion which will be born to the schools 
by the distribution of facts, showing 
that the graduates of the schools are 
making good.
The equipment of the school is one 
of the things by which its place is 
largely judged by the public. A Jour­
nal, by the publication of research

work which has been done at the 
schools, can easily make known the 
facilities which are extended to stu­

There is no doubt that the Journal 
can be made of incalculable benefit 
to every student in the schools. Those 
who have made it a possibility should 
be congratulated.

For the last two months the Junior 
Prom, committee has been working 
hard and earnestly to make this most 
important event of the school life, a 
rousing success. Now in order to as­
sure this success, the committee must 
have the full support of the student- 
body.
The feeling thus far expressed has 
not been at all favorable to the mat­
ter and this has caused much 
concern. The fellows are urged to 
do all they can to make this event a 
success.
The Prom, is to be held at the Ho­
tel Schenley, February 12, the grand 
march beginning promptly at 9 P. M. 
Dancing will continue from 9:00 to ? 
Refreshments will be served some 
time during the evening.
Sig. Scalzo, the well known musi­
cian, will have charge of the musical 
side of the Prom, and every one may 
feel satisfied that it will be capably 
performed.
So don’t forget February 12, at 9 
P. M., and everybody help.

The Thistle boxes have been placed 
on the bulletin boards of the four 
schools. They are intended to receive 
snap-shots, jokes, grinds, etc. If the 
name of the person submitting snap­
shots is placed on the back of the 
picture the same will be returned af­
ter the plate is made.
A three weeks campaign will be 
made for selling Thistle receipts com­
mencing February 9 and ending 
March 1. Any person securing the 
order for twenty Thistles will be giv­
en a book for his services. On Feb­
ruary 8 at 4:30 P. M., in Room 1, Ap­
plied Industries, A. M. Stevenson will 
meet all persons wishing to sell re­
ceipts.

The United States is the most fav­
ored country in the west during the 
European war and the most favored 
parts of this country are the West 
and Northwest. This may be due to 
accident, topography or a result of na­
tional tempermental characteristic 
but such, nevertheless, is the consen­
sus of opinion of men who are known 
to hold supreme rank as authorities upon 
such conditions.
Many cities were, before the dec­
laration of this war, upon the thres­
hold of a renewed business epoch and 
numerous new lines of financial, 
wholesale and retail, and manufactur­
ing projects were planned. But when 
the first flash of war reached our coast 
cities, we imitated in mock dignity 
men of business active before our 
time, and a stricture in economics fol­
lowed, diluting business and intimi­
dating capital.
Today the situation seems nearer 
an era of clearer destination and Pitts­
burgh bankers state that the tempor 
of the money market is now nearly 
normal and with co-operation with 
the Federal Reserve Banks will en­
courage and reinforce business.
Let us glance at a few of the head­
lines of our daily papers and learn 
what they imply. Very recently an 
order for steel armor plates was 
placed with a Pittsburgh steel manu­
facturer. Of a more latent date, large 
quantities of woolen goods and farm 
products, such as one million army 
blankets and five carloads of eggs 
was shipped from Duluth, Minnesota, 
to Europe. This we suppose to de­
termine that foreign exchange has 
been so nearly righted as to rapidly 
develop export business.
Owing to the curtailment, in the 
war lands, of farm and dairy products, 
the United States must become the 
natural supply base for European ne­
cessities. This fact has been astutely 
noted by farmers and grain men of the 
Central and Northwestern states, par­
ticularly those of Montana, North and 
South Dakotas and Minnesota. These 
states have seeded large areas to grain 
and will hold a plentiful supply of 
grain and farm produce. As a very 
necessary result of this Western alert­
ness, the shipping lines plying the 
Great Lakes, from Duluth, Minnesota, 
to all Lake Erie and Ontario ports, 
have installed refrigerating systems 
upon their ships. By transportation 
over such water lines, the produce of 
the Central and Western areas may 
send his butter, eggs and poultry to 
the great Eastern consuming mar­
kets, with speed and above all as- 
surity of safety in keeping and trans­
portation. The Eastern dealers were 
at fifst a little skeptical in regard to 
such transportation but upon a closer 
second thought they realize its bene­
fits and its necessity as a stable factor 
in the conveyance of Western pro­
ducts to Eastern consumers.

The Techites of Freeport and the 
nearby towns had a real Tech enter­
tainment on the evening of January 
5th, in Seitz’s Opera House, at Free­
port, Pa. The people responsible for 
this affair were a committee of Tech 
students and alumni; Mr. N. C. Hill 
and Mr. James E. Kesner, Day 
Science; Mr. Robert O’Brien, ex-Day 
Science; Mr. Kennedy, of the Night 
School; and Mr. Guy Elliott, an alum­
nus, Class of 1913.
The program for the evening con­
sisted of a lecture by Dean Connelley, 
on “Training the Student for Tech­
nical Work;” four reels of “Student 
Scenes at Carnegie Tech,” and several 
selections of music. As their guests 
at this gathering, the followers of the 
Plaid had the teachers of the High 
and Public Schools; about three hun­
dred of the Freeport High School 
students, together with their- parents; 
and many alumni from adjoining 
towns. Mr. Seitz, the owner of the 
Opera House, was very cordial, donat­
ing the auditorium almost without 
charge, remembered by many who go 
to Camp Carnegie as one who has 
always been a friend of Tech. The 
enthusiasm which was manifest at this 
meeting is just one more mark of the 
interest which is felt in Carnegie Tech 
by the people of Western Pennsyl­
vania.

first meeting of the C. I. T. Economic 
Society. This society has officially been 
organized only two weeks ago, and I 
presume that many do not know what 
the objects of this organization are. I 
will try to explain this as concisely as 
possible.
The C. I. T. Economic Society is affi­
liated with the Intercollegiate Socialist 
Society. This society has over sixty 
chapters in over sixty different colleges 
and universities of the country. The 
purpose of the I. S. S. as expressed in 
the first clause of its constitution is as 
follows: “To promote an intelligent
interest in socialism among college men 
and women.” As a study chapter of the
I. S S. the C. I. T. Economic Society 
had subscribed to this purpose.
The labor question is getting to be one 
of the most important questions in this 
country, and there is no doubt that in 
ten or so years it will be the most im­
portant. The trouble caused lately in 
Colorado, West Virginia, etc., are good 
indications. To us engineers the labor 
problem is of special importance. We, 
as future foremen, managers, and super­
intendents will have to serve as the con­
necting units between labor and capital. 
To us will be directed the petitions of 
the workers on one side, to us will be 
made demands from the other side to 
lessen the discontent of the workers. 
How are we going to meet this position 
without a thorough knowledge of the 
labor question, without an intelligent un­
derstanding of the labor situation?
Socialism is claiming to offer satisfac­
tory solutions to all social, economic and 
industrial evils of today. Let us see 
whether they are right or wrong. We 
can do it by an impartial study and dis­
cussion of the principles of Socialism.
This is what the C. I. T. Economic 
Society is organized for. It is going 
to be an inter-school organization to 
which every member of the faculty and 
student of any of the four schools is 
eligible.

The Athletic Association of the Mar­
garet Morrison Carnegie School gave a 
dance on Friday evening, January 15th, 
in the Recreation Room of the Mar­
garet Morrison Building. This was the 
first dance given by the day students 
this season, and it proved a huge suc­
cess.
The dancing started about eight-thirty 
and continued until twelve-thirty o’clock. 
About sixty-five couples were present. 
Miss Elizabeth Stoner, head of the De­
partment of Physical Education, and a 
member of the Executive Committee of 
the Athletic Association, and Miss Car­
rie Lyon, head of the Household Econ­
omics Department, and chairman of the 
Students’ Activities Committee, were the 
chaperones of the evening.
The music was excellent and every 
one enjoyed the evening. The pro­
ceeds of the dance will go in the treas­
ury of the Athletic Association for the 
purpose of buying sweaters for the 
Varsity team, and for the basketball 
pennant and hockey cup.

Wednesday afternoon the Department 
of Home Arts and Crafts gave a tea 
for the faculty and for the students 
taking work in the department. About 
¡two hundred Were present. It was 
keld in the drawing room, which was 
tastefully and artistically decorated for 
the occasion. A very fine exhibit of 
Chinese embroideries and Japanese 
prints from New York was shown, be­
ing arranged in groups with a definite 
color scheme. The centerpiece was 
Mrs. Ward roses, combined with vio­
lets. Miss Hinman and Miss Dixon 
poured. It was a very enjoyable affair 
and many were heard to say, it was 
the prettiest and most daintily appointed 
tea ever given in the school.

The date of the Margaret Morrison 
Junior Prom this year has been decided 
upon as Friday, February the fifth. 
Elaborate preparations are being made 
and the different committees are hard 
at work. We want every Junior girl 
to make a special effort to be there, be­
cause if you’re not, we are sure you 
will miss something worth while. 
From the rumors that are going around 
in regard to programs, decorations, and 
“eats.” We are sure the Junior Prom 
of the class of 1916 will be the most 
successful ever given.
gor VoeffesGc
The next “Shilling” will appear Feb­
ruary twelfth. This issue will be a 
Valentine number, and the board hopes 
that it will prove still more attractive 
to the students than either of the other 
numbers.
A prize of five dollars has been of­
fered for the best description of a Val­
entine party. This prize will be award­
ed if as many as twelve students com­
pete. The Board is planning to give a 
party on the afternoon of February 
twelfth in the Recreation room using the 
best party scheme submitted. The en­
tire student body will be invited and 
we hope that the girls will remember 
the Christmas party, and help this one 
to be just as successful.
The plan for the Valentine party must 
include the decorations, refreshments 
and favors of entertainment.
PLAID ATTEMPTS TO REDEEM
Continued from Page 1 
The Muskingum game proved the 
old statement, that no team can play 
continuously and travel. Take the 
Juniata team for instance, Thursday 
night they beat Tech. Friday they 
played Pitt and were beaten by a sin­
gle point. Then they played Grove 
City on Saturday, their third success­
ive game, and were walloped by a 
34-14 score. The writer has seen 
Grove City perform on two separate 
occasions, and knows positively that 
Juniata has the superior team, and 
could beat them under ordinary con­
ditions. So what does the 34-14 score 
mean? What does our 60-25 score at 
Muskingum mean? It means only 
one thing, and that is that the team 
did not play as it should have. While 
on one hand there is a- chance for an 
excuse, nevertheless, on the other 
side the team is open to some criti­
cism. They have not been fighting 
and playing as a Tech team should. 
The team, with the exception of Capt. 
Hines, has not been performing up to 
the required standard. At present 
the outlook for many victories is far 
from bright, and something should 
be done to prevent an almost inev­
itable result of a disastrous season. 
Coach Marks has been working tire­
lessly, and conscientiously with the 
team, but he seems unable to get the 
results he should obtain.
To the team, it might be said, go 
out Saturday and fight. Redeem the 
past and play a little basketball that 
is worthy of a basketball team. Don’t 
be discouraged, but fight hard, as all 
Tech teams are wont to do. The sea­
son has scarcely begun and can yet 
be made a success. To the student 
body we say, continue your loyal sup­
port. Come out and encourage the 
fellows and above all don’t knock. 
Let’s help the team back on to its 
feet. Saturday night, Gettysburg, at 
8:15.

There are still several unclaimed 
Thistles in the storeroom of the In­
dustry School. Students holding re­
ceipts for them should present same 
as soon as possible in order that the 
Thistle Board may close its affairs. 
Those not claimed within a suitable 
time will either be sold for $2.00 each, 
or sent to high schools for advertis­
ing purposes.
The Sultan is suing in New York 
courts to secure $10,000 left by one of 
his subjects who died in that city. 
At the war’s end he will still have

Arrangements are speedily nearing 
completion for the banquet and smoker 
to be held at the Fort Pitt Hotel Satur­
day evening, January 30th, by the Night 
Prep. Class. Music and speakers are be­
ing provided and the outlook is bright 
for a real good time.
The Thistle is nearing its date of pub­
lication and in order that Industries 
may be represented as much as possible, 
all material which its students may have 
in the way of snapshots, histories, etc., 
should be dropped into the Thistle box 
near the store room.
We regret to report the critical illness 
of Sumner Fry, upper building student 
and Varsity pitcher. Fry was suddenly 
taken sick a week ago Monday and has 
been confined to the West Penn Hos­
pital since. Under the excellent care he 
is receiving, we look to his early return 
to school.
Reid, Plebe, we are glad to write, is

ed in winning the initial game, 32 to 28. 
Wilkinsburg is met next.
At our Assembly a week ago Wednes­

Every now and then we hear about the 
new mailing system promised some time 
ago. The matter was brought up in our 
Student Assembly last week and further 
elaboration was made in the columns 
of the Tartan. We’d like to see the 
system which was proposed by the Ad­
ministration completed as soon as pos­
sible.
Although we didn’t mention anything 
under this column last week about the 
Industries Bagship, we are certainly 
glad to say that its sale and general wel­
come more than repaid the efforts of its 
Industries Bagpipe, we are certainly 
editors. The proceeds of the sale were 
turned over to the Student Assembly, 
which elected the Bagpipe the official 
organ of the Industries School.
The alumni and students of the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh has adopted a 
unique plan for the advertisement of 
that school. Some time ago a Pitt 
Club was formed by alumni and stu­
dents of the University, in Jefferson 
county. Another similar meeting is 
to be held in Greensburg on January 
22, its purpose being the formation of 
another Pitt Club. This organization 
lias as its supreme aim the advance­
ment of the interests of the Univers­
ity, becoming more and more force­
ful as the University increases. Their 
hope is to interest alumni in their 
Alma Mater and to seek the aid of 
the legislature for an increase in ap­
propriations for buildings. The Club 
will endeavor to attract high school 
graduates to the University and have 
appointed working representatives in 
all the principle towns of Westmore­
land county.
Statistics show that twelve foot­
ball players have been killed this fall. 
Only two of the victims were college 
men. Neither of the two college men 
were injured in an intercollegiate 
gartje. None of the twelve were more 
than twenty years of age, and the 
accidents occurred while the victims 
were making a tackle in a majority 
of the cases. In 1910, twenty-two men 
were killed; in 1911, eleven men; in 
1912, thirteen men; in 1913, fourteen 
men.
The weekly paper of Heidelberg 
University has a unique method of 
calling for subscription dues. In an 
article, entitled “Ye Afflicted Ones,” 
the manager wrote the following: 
“Anyone suffering from a superfluity 
of cash or any other allied disease, 
can find instant relief, if not a posi­
tive cure, by calling around at the 
publication sanctum and paying their 
subscription. Come early and avoid 
the rush.” Ditto, Tech men.
The University of Pennsylvania 
has passed a resolution whereby a 
college degree will be required for 
entrance into the law school of that 
university. This action makes the 
standard of admission as high as that 
of any law school in the world.

Four weeks ago Saturday Grove 
City celebrated the thirtieth anniver­
sary of the granting of her charter by 
the dedication of Memorial Hall, a 
new dormitory for the men. The ex­
pense of the erection of the building 
was borne by the family of Joseph 
Newton Pew, in whose memory the 
building is dedicated in recognition of 
his service as president of the board 
of trustees for eighteen years.
The Rhode Island State College has 
decided to reward the Editor-in-Chief 
and Business Managers of its college 
weekly with a gold seal in the form 
of a watch fob with the name and 
position of the recipient engraved on 
the back.
Graduate Manager Foster has an­
nounced the gridiron schedule for 
1915, on examining wdiich it is evident 
that a much harder series of battles 
awaits the Plaid eleven next fall. 
There have been many changes, the 
only games remaining from the 1914 
schedule being Waynesburg, Alle­
gheny, Grove City and Pitt. Only 
one trip has been arranged, the game 
with the Case School of Applied Sci­
ence, in Cleveland. Western Reserve, 
of the same city, comes to Pittsburgh, 
and an endeavor will be made to 
alternate these two every year, here 
and in Cleveland, thus commencing a 
series of inter-city contests.
The other major contest is with 
West Virginia University, always a 
strong and aggressive team, who 
should make it interesting for Car­
negie. It is noticeable that the Alle­
gheny game has been moved up to 
October 16th instead of being the
last game of the season. The sched­
ule is as follows. It will be noticed 
that Bethany is replaced by Hiram: 
September 25, Thiel College at home. 
October 2, Waynesburg College at
home.
October 9, West Virginia University 
at home.
October 16, Allegheny College at
home.
October 23, Grove City College at
home.
October 30, Hiram College at home. 
November 6, Case at Cleveland. 
November 13, Pitt at home.
November 20, Western Reserve at 
home.
The success of Coach “Wally” Stef­
fen and his men last fall brought much 
favorable comment in the world of 
inter-collegiate sport and resulted in 
offers from many colleges, among 
whom were Cornell Colgate, Chicago, 
Notre Dame, Oberlin, Purdue and 
John Hopkins. Work has already 
been started on a new practice field 
on the site of the proposed stadium 
and this will be in good shape for 
early football practice this spring.

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES

Last evening the Tech Design Club 
and Tech Architectural Club held 
their annual joint dance at the Twen­
tieth Century Club. It was one of 
the most successful dances given by 
the club. About seventy-five couple 
were present. The programmes were 
very novel, being designed and exe­
cuted by the Design Club girls. Ni- 
rella’s orchestra furnished the music.
The Class “B” charette finished last 
Saturday night with a goodly num­
ber of fine projets both in “plan” and 
“orders.” It is hoped that Carnegie 
may pull the judgment in the major­
ity this time. We are glad to wel­
come the new professor, Mr. Stern- 
feldt, to our department.

On Friday night, at Marietta, the 
college of that town defeated Car­
negie in a rough game by a 28-14 
score. Our boys were greatly handi­
capped by not having Douthett in the 
lineup, and by the fact that they trav­
eled seven hours immediately before 
the game, besides playing the pre­
vious night. The result does not in 
the least show the relative merits of 
the two teams and we can safely pre­
dict that the next game will result 
in our favor. It seemed to be Mari­
etta’s object to play our boys as 
roughly as possible, and the referee 
officiating readily allowed the home 
team to accomplish their purpose. 
Time and again the Tech men were 
charged bodily into a brick wall as 
they were about to shoot for the bas­
ket, and yet Marietta was scarcely 
ever penalized, as shown by the small 
number of fouls called on the home 
team. Referee Whiting is a brother 
of Forward Whiting, of the Marietta 
team. The play was so rough that 
at one time a Tech man got mixed 
up in a fistic encounter with one of 
the home team; this is an action which 
we can say never occurred on our 
home floor, at least, not in the writ­
er’s memory, and it speaks well for 
the Tech spirit toward our opponents, 
a spirit which stands out in strong 
contrast to that shown by some of 
our small college rivals. Hines played 
a sterling game for Tech, while Hayer 
excelled in the shooting line for Mar­
ietta beside being somewhat aggress- 
H e with his hands.

Muskingum College, with an almost 
invincible team at home, succeeded in 
handing Tech her third defeat in as 
many nights by the large score of 
60-25. The game was played at New 
Concord, and our opponents put up 
a clean, fast game, much the contrary 
to one that had been played the pre­
vious night at Marietta. The officiat­
ing was also good. Muskingum, with 
her veteran team, to the man of 
three years, has not been defeated at 
home since 1912, when our own Car­
negie team succeeded in downing 
them by a close score. The whole 
Muskingum team displayed an excel­
lent amount of basketball, and Mont­
gomery at forward and Aiken at cen­
ter, proved to be dead shots at the 
basket. Hines again displayed good 
form for Tech, but his efforts went 
for naught.

The regular monthly meeting of the 
Student Branch of the American So­
ciety of Mechanical Engineers was 
held at Machinery Hall on Wednes­
day, January 13. During the regular 
business meeting it was decided to 
purchase the regular student branch 
pins for the members of the Society.
One of the best papers ever pre­
sented before the members was read 
by Mr. Bickley, C. I. T., ’09. The first 
part of his paper was devoted to what 
he had learned after leaving Carnegie. 
In this connection he made some 
pointed and valuable suggestions. He 
said, “I came to Carnegie Tech mostly 
by accident. . . I am glad I came. . . 
It is the coming school in this coun­
try.” Continuing he said, “Whenever 
you start to do something you must 
first know your materials. . . . Learn 
from the practical man............What­
ever we do, say, or think has a cost.
. ... We must have tact to be suc­
cessful. Tact is conducting ourselves 
so the total profit from our actions 
shall be a maximum. . . . What you 
cannot produce quickly is not your 
own. What you can produce quickly
is what you are valued at............No
man can increase his worth by doing 
the same thing over in the same way. 
.... A man should take time to med­
itate. . . . He should study biog­
raphy; it will show him how the great 
men attained success. The most valu­
able thing I learned at Tech was to 
think clearly.”
The next part of his paper was de­
voted to his efficiency engineering at 
the H. J. Heinz plant. He showed 
how by a system of card indexes and 
curves he was able to keep a close 
watch on all the operations going on 
in the plant. His chief duties he 
said were to cut down the wastes go­
ing on in the plant, and to pass upon 
other technical matters which came 
up, such as the purchasing of machin­
ery, constructing of containers, etc. 
He urged every one present to start 
a card index for personal use.
The last part of his talk was devoted 
to his invention, the Motorgraph, 
which Prof. Trinks says is the best 
invention that has been perfected by 
a Tech graduate. The Motorgraph 
is an electrical sign on which the 
wordforming letters come on the sign 
at the right hand side and move over 
its face going off at the left hand side. 
He told of many interesting and puz­
zling obstacles which he ran up 
against in bringing this invention to 
perfection.
The paper was without a doubt one 
of the best that has ever been pre­
sented at the school, and the fact that 
it was delivered by a graduate of Tech 
made it doubly appreciated.

On Wednesday, January 13, the 
students listened to one of the most 
interesting talks of the year. The 
speaker, who was introduced by Dean 
Leete, was Mr. W. H. Stevenson and 
the subject was “Impersonal Impres­
sions of Johnny Bull and Tommy At­
kins.”
Mr. Stevenson was very closely as­
sociated with the beginning of Tech 
and is also a very influential man in 
Pittsburgh.
On the 29th of July, 1914, Mr. Stev­
enson sailed for England on the 
steamship “Baltic,” as a member of 
the American committee to the Anglo 
American Exposition which was to 
celebrate 100 years of peace between 
England and America. At that time 
there had been no general talk of war 
but the situation was admitted to be 
strained.
The ship had been out a couple of 
days when orders were given that all 
lights must be out, portholes covered 
and everything done to conceal the 
vessel. This was the first intimation 
any one had of war. When the ship 
arrived at Queenstown the passen­
gers then learned that “the fat was 
in the fire.”
On the seventh the party reached 
Liverpool, but Mr. Stevenson said he 
noticed nothing unusual there. In 
London however, the feeling in the 
middle class was very adverse to the 
war. “Tommy Atkins” was the hero 
of the hour and it was “Mr. Atkins” 
now.
Some very pathetic sights were seen 
in London where the “nuts with their 
‘flappahs’ ” went to the station to em­
bark.
Mr. Stevenson digressed a little to 
show that even an Englishman can 
see a joke and after hearing the story 
of the “bawth” one cannot help but 
agree with him.
Immediately after the declaration 
of wrar Americans began swarming 
into England to get passage home. 
A committee was formed in London, 
which did very excellent work in aid­
ing stranded Americans.
The Germans were also taken good 
care of, as Mr. Stevenson found out, 
when he asked the soldier. “Tommy 
Atkins” told Mr. Stevenson they were

taking good care of them, feeding 
them bread and water and mostly 
water at that.
Mr. Stevenson said that the meth­
ods of the English government were 
nothing short of marvelous, espec­
ially that section devoted to the cen­
sorship. Everything was seized, that 
could benefit the military in any way.
At Southampton a remarkable ex­
ploit was performed in transporting 
100,000 men to France without any 
one, excepting those in authority, 
knowing a single thing about it.
Mr. Stevenson had to cut short his 
talk on account of limited time but 
before closing he said that no matter 
how this war ended Russia would 
have a Southern seaport and would 
make a gigantic effort for world trade.

A problem more perplexing than 
any that ever confronted the re­

nesday afternoon in the High Tension 
Laboratory.
The problem is not solved yet but 
there are some very expert deducers 
at work who expect to have some re­
sults soon. Any one shedding any 
light on the matter will be fittingly 
rewarded.
The situation calls for a quick ac­
tion as it is not a normal condition 
for seventeen students to work hard 
for no pay other than an oil-soaked 
shirt, as witness Mr. Schiffman, who 
dove in a 100 gallon tank of oil for a 
lost lead.
Mr. Lee numbered among those 
who received a reward not befitting his 
efforts, for he, in welcoming Mr. Ettle 
who arrived late, got a mushy recep­
tion.
As stated before, any one who 
knows, or who has a faint glimmer­
ing of knowledge, why Junior Elec­
tricals should work at manual labor, 
will receive a handsome and appropri­
ate reward.
