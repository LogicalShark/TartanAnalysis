Student search committee to change leadership
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
Barring unforeseen occur­
rences, sophomore Marc Roston 
was to have been elected chair of 
the Student Presidential Search 
Committee yesterday.
Roston, the only person nomi­
nated for the position at last Mon­
day’s committee meeting, would 
replace Sophomore Kimberly 
McGraw who was elected as act­
ing chair of the committee when 
it was formed in February.
Committee members said that 
they had agreed at that time that 
the acting chair would serve until 
the release of the committee’s 
white paper. The white paper was 
released two weeks ago.
The chair elected yesterday will 
serve until the end of the presi­
dential search process next 
Spring.
McGraw explained that she
chose not to seek re-election be­
cause of time pressures and be­
cause she will not be in Pitts­
burgh over the summer while the 
committee continues its work.
Roston said that he thought 
McGraw was being honest about 
her reasons for deciding not to 
run but commented that he did 
not think she could have won 
anyway because he felt that most 
of the committee members were 
dissatisfied with the way she had
done her job.
McGraw disagreed. “People 
came up to me and asked me to 
run again,” she said.
Committee member Deborah 
Sinn also disagreed with Roston’s 
opinion that most of the commit­
tee wanted to displace McGraw 
as chair. Another member of the 
committee, Ingrid Bromberg, said 
that she was not sure whether 
McGraw would have won re-elec- 
tion.
The disagreement over whether 
McGraw could have been re­
elected, had she run, is one of a 
series of disputes between her 
and Roston. Roston has also 
claimed that McGraw ran com­
mittee meetings badly and said 
that there was tension within 
meetings and several verbal con­
flicts broke out.
McGraw said that she did not 
think the problem was as bad as

Former Tech 
president 
Warner dies
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
Dr. John Christian Warner, a na­
tionally-known chemist and one-time 
president of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, died last Wednesday 
at Friendship Village in Upper St. 
Clair in suburban Pittsburgh. He 
was 91.
During World War II, Warner 
supervised research on the-chemis­
try and metallurgy of plutonium as a 
part of the Manhattan Project which 
developed the first nuclear weapons.
Warner was born in 1897 in 
Goshen; Indiana. His father was a 
farmer and lumberman; his mother 
was a country school teacher.
He became president of Carnegie 
Tech in 1950 after a year as vice 
president and president-elect. He was 
dean of graduate studies from 1945- 
49 and head of the Chemistry De­
partment from 1938-49.
The Warner administration pio­
neered the use of computers in edu­
cation, establishing a computation 
center in 1956 that helped the insti­
tution gain national recognition as a

center of research in computer sci­
ence.
Through gifts and purchases, the 
Carnegie Tech campus expanded by 
almost 20 percent during Warner’s 
tenure. Classroom, research, and 
student housing space increased 
markedly.
Warner’s administration also saw 
a $5 million endowment to CFA by 
the A. W. Mellon Charitable Trust in 
1958 and the establishment of the 
Department of Graphic Arts in 1960.
In 1965, Warner was succeeded as 
president by H. Guyford Stever. He 
was honored by the University in 
1966 when the administration build­
ing was completed and named John 
C. Warner Hall.

Two minor incidents mar 
Spring Carnival festivities
Stick flies in hockey booth altercation
By JAMES B. ENDRES
Tartan Assistant News Editor
A member of the CMU Hockey Club was 
arrested for aggravated assault Friday night 
by Campus Police after attacking a carnival 
visitor with his hockey stick.
The victim was treated at Presbyterian 
University Hospital and released Friday.
Campus Police and the Spring Carnival 
Committee declined to identify either the 
attacker or the victim pending an investiga­
tion.
The Hockey Club was also unable to identify 
the attacker, and Presbyterian Hospital de­
clined to release any information regarding 
the victim.
The Hockey Club was forced to close its 
booth early because of the incident.
According to Sergeant William Ricci of 
Campus Police, a juvenile visitor to Carnival 
had been “having words” with the goalie at the 
hockey booth.

20-year-old victim of Forbes hit and run
By JONATHAN LEVY
Tartan Contributing Editor
A 20-year-old woman was struck by a hit 
and run driver at the intersection of Forbes 
and Morewood early Saturday morning.
Pam Riegot, who is not a Carnegie Mellon 
student, was struck at approximately 1:50 
am while crossing Forbes Avenue against the 
light in the direction of Morewood Gardens 
and the fraternities.
According to Carnegie Mellon Police Ser­
geant William Ricci and Sophomore Matt 
Ruben, a Chevette slammed on its brakes to 
avoid hitting Riegot but a maroon Triumph 
TR7 sped around the Chevette and hit her, 
throwing her into another car approximately 
25 feet away.
Riegot was taken to Presbyterian Univer­
sity Hospital and was in fair condition as of 
Saturday afternoon.
The TR7 sped away and was followed quickly 
by the Chevette. Ruben said that it appeared

CFP, Panhel 
to propose 
37% kickback
Plan would cause a 
hike in activities fees
By HOWDY PIERCE
Tartan News Editor
The Greek system is expected to present Student Senate 
Rules Committee Chair Matt Ruben with a petition and 
proposal outlining a kickback of 37 percent of all Greek 
activities fees tonight.
The proposal, if implemented, would “almost certainly” 
mean an increase in the student activities fee, according to 
Associate Dean of Student Affairs Lois Cox.
The proposal is a revision of an anonymous earlier version 
that circulated among the Greek houses in late January.
Currently, full-time students pay $40 activities fees each 
semester. Activities fee money is controlled by Student 
Senate and used to fund organizations such as Spirit, Kiltie 
Band, the Gay and Lesbian Alliance, WRCT, The Tartan, 
and the Activities Board.
The Greek proposal would result in a reduction in Student 
Senate’s budget of over $38,000 annually, an amount which 
equals almost 9% of the total monies available to activities- 
fee sponsored organizations.
Under the plan outlined in the proposal, CFP and Panhel 
would each receive a kickback of $14.80 per fraternity or 
sorority member.
The Graduate Student Organization already receives 37% 
of all graduate student activities fees, a policy that was set 
a number of years ago with the rationale that graduate 
students generally do not participate in undergraduate 
activities.
This year, Senate kicked back an estimated $58,000 to 
GSO.
“We see [the GSO kickback] as a kind of precedent,” CFP 
President Phil Antonson says. “A lot of Greeks feel that 
we’re paying twice, with our house dues and the activities 
fees.”
Antonson says that most Greek parties are open to non- 
Greeks, so Greek dues go to support non-Greek social life. 
“We feel a large [number of students] attend our parties,” he 
says.

The Carnegie Mellon University Libraries have received a 
$1.2 million grant from the Pew Charitable Trusts of Philadel­
phia for a three-year project to develop a state-of-the-art auto­
mated library system.
The current Library Information System (LIS) used by Carne­
gie Mellon Libraries provides automated access to the library 
catalog, the Academic American Encyclopedia, the American 
Heritage Dictionary, bibliographic databases produced by the 
Information Access Company, and several local databases, in­
cluding the campus directory.
The Pew Memorial Trust grant will support the development 
of LIS II, wich will offer several improvements to this computer 
system, including an expansion of resources and reference ma­
terial available to users, the capacity to store and display the full 
text of a document, a user interface to incorporate the power of 
personal computers and the campus Andrew computer network, 
better integration with word processors, and the use of cost- 
saving server computers instead of a central mainframe.
“LIS II will dramatically change the information environment 
on campus and will serve" as a model for other universities and 
institutions,” says Thomas J. Michalak, associate vice president 
for academic services and director of university libraries. For 
more information on LIS, call Michalak at x2446.

Russell J. Cameron, a 1941 Graduate of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Art, has donated $100,000 to the University to 
establish a distinguished art lecture series honoring his former 
teacher Robert L. Lepper, Carnegie Mellon emeritus professor 
of design.
Lepper is a sculptor who counted artists Andy Warhol, Philip 
Pearlstein, and Mel Bochner among his students during his 45 
years of teaching at Carnegie Mellon. A 1927 graduate of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, he joined the faculty in 1930 
and retired in 1975.
“He was a good teacher,” Andy Warhol biographer Rainer 
Crone wrote of Lepper in 1987. “From 1947-49 Warhol became 
involved in a program in pictorial design (Lepper’s course) 
which could not have been more carefully considered.”
Cameron is president of the Ross Operating Valve Company 
in Troy Michigan.

WARSAW, Poland (AP) — Po­
land’s Parliament last Monday 
lifted the seven-year ban on the 
Solidarity trade movement and 
enacted constitutional changes to 
give Poland the first freely elected 
legislative body in the East Bloc.
The Sejm, or parliament, passed 
a package of six bills that enact 
into law a historic agreement on 
political, economic, and trade 
union reforms reached yesterday 
between the Solidarity-led oppo­
sition and communist authorities.
Polish leader Wojciech 
Jaruzelski, who suppressed the 
Soviet bloc’s only independent 
labor movement when he imposed 
martial law in December 1981, 
looked on as the votes were taken.
The Sejm passed the constitu­
tional changes 384 to 4, with 17 
abstentions, and the new law on 
trade unions 339 to 4 with 43 
abstentions.

GENEVA (DJ) — More than
100 countries overcame an im­
passe on liberalizing world trade 
and agreed to guidelines to allow
them to move into the next phase 
of what experts call the most am­
bitious and complex trade nego­
tiation ever attempted.
But the program adopted Sat­
urday after four days of grueling 
talks faces an onslaught of oppo­
sition from special-interest groups 
and governments. And the next 
phase of negotiations, most ex­
perts say, is even more compli­
cated than the one just completed 
behind schedule.
Many question whether a final 
agreement can be reached, as 
hoped, by the end of 1990. The 
member nations of the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
endorsed a package of measures 
that will take effect immediately, 
including a halt on new farm 
subsidies and a strengthened 
system for settling disputes.

JERUSALEM (AP) — Riot po- 
lice last Monday fired tear gas 
and rubber bullets at hundreds of 
stone-throwing Palestinians fol­
lowing Moslem prayers at the al- 
Aqsa mosque, one of Islam’s holi­
est sites.
Clouds of tear gas rose from the 
complex, located on Temple
Mount, and the sound of shots 
could be heard from several 
hundred meters away. Police ar­
rested about 30 demonstrators.
The violence came after about
15,000 worshipers attended noon 
prayers on the first day of Rama­
dan, the Moslem holy month and 
a period of religious fervor.
Israeli officials have said they 
feared an escalation of the Pales­

SRI LANKA (AP) — A car 
bomb exploded outside a hotel in 
the northeastern city of Trin- 
comalee Thursday, killing at least 
38 people and injuring 57 in an 
attack military officials blamed 
on Tamil rebels.
Shortly after the blast, a group 
of angry Sinhalese attacked Tamil 
residents in the city with knives, 
killing one and injuring seven, 
according to military officials in 
Colombo.
Officials denied earlier reports 
from witnesses that eight Tamils 
were killed in the stabbings.
The explosion in the port city, 
145 miles northeast of Colombo, 
occurred as more than 100 Sin­
halese in a marketplace adjacent 
to the hotel hunted for gifts and 
sweets to celebrate the Sinhalese 
and Tamil New Year holidays.
The mid-morning blast flat 
tened four neighboring sh 
military officials said. Sketchy 
reports reaching Colombo did not 
say whether the hotel was still 
standing.

MOSCOW (AP) — A short cir­
cuit apparently started a fire on a 
Soviet nuclear submarine, caus­
ing several explosions that may 
have cracked the hull of the ship.
Tass reported two torpedoes 
armed with nuclear warheads 
were aboard the nuclear-powered 
submarine that sank in the Nor- 
weigan sea Friday and killed 42 of 
the 69 sailors aboard.
“It is possible that the hull was 
cracked in a series of places," 
Izvestia said. The explosions may 
have occurred in seven pieces c 
“special equipment,” Izvestia said. 
It did not further identify them.
The Soviets officially informed 
Norway of the accident nearly nine 
hours after the vessel sank.
The Norwegian news agency 
NTB claimed Norwegian rescue 
helicopters could have reached the 
ship several hours before Soviet 
fishing vessels if the Soviets had 
asked for help promptly.

NEW YORK (AP) — A former 
ship’s officer of Exxon Shipping 
Co. says, in a complaint and depo­
sition, that he told the company 
at least four years ago that the 
skipper of the ill-fated oil tanker 
Exxon Valdez had a drinking 
problem but that he failed to get 
any company response. Captain 
Joseph Hazelwood was in com­
mand when the tanker was im­
paled on an Alaskan reef, creat­
ing the biggest oil spill in North 
American history.
Tests run on Hazelwood by the 
Coast Guard nine hours after the 
Exxon Valdez slammed into a reef 
in Prince William Sound indicated 
that he was dnmk at the time of 
the accident. In a lengthy deposi­
tion filed in New York State
Supreme Court in New York City, 
former second mate Bruce Amero 
alleges that he saw Hazelwood 
leave the bridge and go below to 
drink as another oil tanker, on 
which both were serving, was 
leaving Alaska’s Valdez Harbor 
during a trip in the early 1980s.
Amero testified he complained 
to the shipping unit of Exxon Corp. 
in January 1985 and on two other 
occasions about Hazelwood’s 
behavior. But, he said in the two- 
part deposition, he failed to get 
any response.

WASHINGTON (AP) — Say- 
ing he felt like “a pawn in a chess 
game,” Oliver North conceded he 
lied to Congress after his boss 
sent him against his will to a 
session where he denied provid­
ing assistance to the Contras.“Did 
you tell the truth at that meeting 
on Aug. 6,1986?” defense lawyer 
Brendan Sullivan asked North.
“No,” said North. “I... went into 
the meeting not believing it would 
be illegal not to tell Congress the 
truth. And that’s why I didn’t 
think the meeting would be a good 
idea.”
The former White House aide 
said then-national security ad­
viser John Poindexter told him 
“You go to the meeting with them, 
it’s informal.”
“I felt like a pawn in a chess 
game being played by giants,” 
North said.
North said that he had wanted 
the Reagan White House to in­
voke its executive privilege 
against a looming congressional 
inquiry of secret Contra aid in 
1986, but was brushed aside by 
Poindexter.

Admissions offers cash incentive for sleeping bag hosts
By JAMES A. LEACH
Special to The Tartan
The Office of Admissions announced 
that due to the increase in the number of 
prospective students planning to attend 
the second spring sleeping bag weekend 
on April 23-24, it would be offering a cash 
incentive to organizations willing to host 
sleeping baggers.
Over half the students who have re­
served spaces are still without hosts.
Admissions reports that despite an 
eight percent drop in applications for 
admission for 1990-91, the number of 
those applicants interested in visiting 
the campus is up nearly 30 percent over
last spring. This means that additional 
hosts will be required to house the extra 
visitors.
“There has been an overwhelming in­
crease in the number of students partici­
pating in the final spring sleeping bag 
weekend of 1989,” said Kim Jessen, an 
Admissions Counselor who is coordinat­
ing the sleeping bag weekend.
Currently, there are about 170 stu­
dents who have hosts for the weekend. 
However, Admissions estimates that an 
additional 170 students still await hosts. 
To meet that need, Admissions imple­
mented the cash incentive plan, the 
brainchild of Student Ombudsman Mi­
chael Murphy.
Despite an eight percent drop in applications 
for admission for 1990-91, the number of 
those applicants interested in visiting the 
campus is up nearly 30 percent.
Under this plan, organizations will be 
paid two dollars per sleeping bagger it 
hosts; the two dollars will be paid to the 
group or floor fund of the students who 
host the sleeping baggers.
According to Murphy, his goal was to 
give the money to thank the students 
who took the trouble to host the baggers
rather than as an incentive.
As it stands now, the plan will only 
affect this sleeping bag weekend and will 
be retroactive, paying those who have 
already agreed to be hosts.
The first of its kind, the plan was 
primarily designed to target on-campus 
facilities capable of hosting multiple
sleeping baggers such as the Greek sys­
tem, clubs, and dormority floors.
“Since the visits take place a week 
before the students must make their 
final decision as to which school they will 
enroll, the quality of their visit (to CMU) 
is crucial,” said Jessen.
Last year, on the first sleeping bag 
weekend, 43 of 113 (39 percent) of those 
in attendance enrolled. On the second 
sleeping bag weekend, 120 of 213 (59 
percent) of those who attended enrolled, 
representing an increase in yield of 20 
percentage points.
Interested students can pick up the 
necessary forms to become a host at the 
Admissions office or from any RA.
Fenton releases report with proposed changes
By PRISCILLA HSUE
Tartan Staffwriter
History professor Edwin Fen­
ton, co-director of the University 
Teaching Center, has released a 
report summarizing suggested 
changes to the University, and 
promised that he would make a 
“personal effort” to see that the
organization of an undergradu­
ate research program, is currently 
being developed by the Univer­
sity Research Council.
At the university level, changes 
under consideration include hav­
ing a more extensive advisory 
system and establishing a uni­
form cheating policy. 
Suggestions at the college level 
are expanding 
honors pro­

Minority groups back Asian-American studies course
By SOO-RYUN SUE
Tartan. Staffwriter
What Spirit began with a demand for 
more awareness concerning minorities 
has triggered some other human rela­
tions activities on the campus.
The activities constitute the possible 
implementation of an Asian-American 
studies course and the formation of a 
new minority coalition called ONE.
For the past few months, junior art 
major Lina Hoshino has been trying to 
implement an Asian-American studies 
course in the H&SS history department. 
She feels that this course is long over­
due.
“A class focusing on the history of 
Asians in America would be a vital addi­
tion to CMU’s new human relations 
program,” said Hoshino. “We already 
have a course on African-American his­
tory, but many students are not aware 
that the Asians also have had a role in 
shaping thehistory of the United States. 
We need to educate both Asians and 
Americans as well.”
Some of the topics that may be in­
cluded are: an analysis of cultural roots, 
race relations, immigration and settle­
ment patterns, and labor, legal, political, 
and social history. The course could also 
examine comparative Asian art and lit­
erature.
To find out how many students might 
be interested in such a course, Hoshino 
took a random survey of 134 students in 
Skibo on March 24th.
Although only 16% of those surveyed 
were Asians, 49% indicated a definite 
interest in taking such a class. The 
majority, 68%, felt that there is a lack of 
minority awareness on CMU campus.
On April 4th, Hoshino and three other 
students met with President Cyert to 
discuss the possible implementation of 
the course. He was sympathetic andfairly 
optimistic. “I understand what you are 
after,” Cyert said. “It’s part of what I 
want to do here, mainly to give more 
international flavor to the [university] 
curriculum so the students, not only here 
but in other places, will have some un­
derstanding of what’s happening in the
rest of the world.”
Cyert told Hoshino he plans to confer 
with H&SS Dean Stephen Fienberg, 
Associate Dean Joseph Devine and His­
tory Department Head Peter Steams 
before end of this month.
Hoshino also spoke with Fienberg and 
Stearns, and said both were fairly opti­
mistic about the course. “[Lina’s pro­
posal] is an interesting idea, and we are 
going to take it seriously,” Fienberg told 
The Tartan.
Fienberg said the preliminary report 
on the topic will be brought up in the next 
H&SS College Council meeting. “Wehave 
to wait and see, but this is fairly acceler­
ated process,” he said.
Stearns agreed with Fienberg. “I think 
it was a well-stated proposal, a funda­
mentally good idea. It’s obvious that 
Asian-Americans are gaining an increas­
ingly active consciousness of their group 
and that’s desirable. I also think that 
there’s growing literature on Asian- 
Americans. Therefore, this is a respect­
able topic academically, and not just in 
terms of how it pleases particular groups 
of students.”
Both Fienberg andSteams believe that 
the actual implementation of the course 
will come down to the availability of 
resources and a faculty member who is 
capable ofteachingit. Stearns said, “John 
Modell is such a professor, but he is 
booked until next spring. Bringing some­
one outside from the department is pos­
sible — but then the question of funding 
needs to be raised.”
Both Fienberg and Steams discussed 
making the course more feasible by situ­
ating Asian-American Studies in a 
broader cultural context. “It should be 
put into a context which the history 
department would be interested in doing 
and in which a broader number of stu­
dents would be interested in taking it,” 
Fienberg said.
Stearns said a course analyzing and 
comparing“old” and “new” immigrations 
will be offered this summer on a trial 
basis. It will be taught by a graduate 
student.
Referring to the course, Steams said, 
“I’m eager to find a generic framework. I
would like to see the course offered in the 
spring of next year with particular focus 
on Asian-Americans."
Representatives from minority organi­
zations such as Spirit, the Gay and Les­
bian Alliance, Asian Student Associa­
tion, Korean Student Association, and 
the Women’s Issues Collective expressed 
their interest in getting the course 
started.
To support this issue and other kinds 
of activities concerning minorities, rep­
resentatives from the organizations came 
together and formed a coalition called 
ONE last month.
ONE not only includes formal organi­
zations but also individuals who are not 
associated with a group but are inter-
ested in minority issues.
For its second meeting on April 6, 
members from Educational Action on 
Latin America, Mayur (an Indian stu­
dent organization), Amnesty Interna­
tional, and Chinese Graduate Student 
Organization (CGSO), were present.
Two Senators have participated in 
ONE’s three meetings. “The different 
thing about ONE is that there’s a big 
sense of optimism,” said H&SS Senator 
Matt Ruben. “ONE forces people to learn 
in a friendly and humanistic way. We 
don’t sit around and figure out who our 
opposition is — we figure out how to get 
people into it, which is much better. It’s 
good change, a change for the better.”
As part of its program to increase
awareness among students and to the 
rest of the school community, ONE plans 
to have a Cultural Diversity Dinner on 
April 27.
Each organization will prepare special 
dishes; the setting will be informal and 
open to anyone interested.
To support this event, President Cyert, 
the Student Senate, The Tartan, the 
Housing Office, and the Student Dormi. 
tory Council are each pledging $500. 
Details of the dinner event will be worked 
out at ONE’s next meeting on Tuesday 
April 18, at 10 pm.
ONE has also drafted a proposal to 
acquire additional funds from the Uni- 
versity. Its usual meetings are held every 
Thursday in Morewood Reading Room,

I Peer Gynt to open at Kresge
¡By MICHAEL T. ROSE
\Jartan Diversions Editor
Camegi? Mellon Drama’s third 
mainstag! production of the 1989 
season, Hinrik Ibsen’s epic work 
|far Gynt; will open at the Kresge 
heatre this week.
I Ibsen’s play is a monumental 
[voyage through the world of 
Scandinavian myths and legends, 
'he play follows the title charac­
ter as hejouraeys fromhis origins 
i small village to his eventual 
[destination and fulfillment.
1 According to director Yossi 
[fzraely, Peer Gynt is “the found- 
plaj of modem theatre.” 
[fzraely explains that the charac­
ter of Peer Gynt is “the modern 
Iverymajn, a man in search of 
Tiimself.’1
I The production is a massive 
mdertaking for the department.
The cast consists of more than 30 
performers, including four actors 
who portray Peer Gynt at various 
ages. The sets are large and intri­
cate, and the stage of the Kresge 
has been expanded to allow for 
them.
Director Yzraely holds a doc­
torate from Carnegie Mellon 
Drama and is a member of the 
faculty at Tel Aviv University in 
Israel. He was formerly the artis­
tic director of Israel’s National 
Theatre, and he is currently the 
artistic director of the Khan The­
atre.
Yzraely is a visiting professor 
in the Drama department this 
semester. He will direct Antony 
and Cleopatra for the Three Riv­
ers Shakespeare Festival in July.
In cooperation with the Pitts­
burgh Public Theatre, the Drama 
department is also presenting an
Ibsen symposium on April 22 and 
23 in room 14 of Margaret Morri­
son Carnegie Hall. The sympo­
sium is scheduled to coincide with 
the CMU production of Peer Gynt 
and the Public’s production of 
Hedda Gabler starring Helena 
Ruoti. Admission to the sympo­
sium is free. For more informa­
tion, call the Drama department 
at x2392.
Editor’s Note: As The Tartan 
was going to press, we were in­
formed that the April 19 preview 
performance of Peer Gynt was to 
be cancelled. Call the CFA Box 
Office at x2407 for information.
Peer Gynt will have evening per­
formances at 8 pm on April 20-21 
(preview), 22,25-29 and May 2-6.
There will also be matinees at 2 
pm on April 22, 29, and May 6. 
Seating is limited. Call x2407 for 
ticket information.

Dennis Levine, a convicted in­
side-trader and the man who fin­
gered Wall Street speculator Ivan 
Boesky, was scheduled to speak 
yesterday to a class on crisis man­
agement in the Graduate School 
of Industrial Administration de­
spite criticism from a GSIA stu­
dent publication.
The Robber Barrons, a weekly 
newsletter published by GSIA 
students, carried an anonymous 
article last week which criticized 
the school for inviting Levine to 
speak and sarcasticly suggested 
that the school bring in other 
speakers convicted of ethics vio­
lations.
“Michael Milken is free await­
ing trial. U.S. prosecutors say he 
cheated clients and stockholders, 
manipulated security markets, 
and even tricked a corporation 
into being taken over! Surely a 
graduate program would be in­
adequate without his contribu­
tion,” the newsletter said.
Levine, formerly a managing 
director in the acquisitions de­
partment at Drexel Burnham 
Lambert Inc., was released from 
prison in September after serving 
18 months of a two-year sentence 
for securities fraud, reported last 
Wednesday’s Pittsburgh Press.
As a merger specialist, Levine 
was making more than $1 million 
a year when he illegally traded 
stocks that he knew would be 
involved in takeovers; the deal 
netted him more than $12 mil­
lion.
Levine will speak to Gerald 
Meyer’s “Crisis Management” 
class about the Securities Ex­
change Commission’s investiga­
tion of Drexel, his transgressions 
and eventual conviction.
In the past, Meyer has had 
speakers talk about subjects 
such a as the Tylenol cyanide kill­
ings, the Union Carbide disaster 
at Bhopal, and the Ashland Oil 
spill in Pittsburgh.
These speakers, like Levine, are 
not paid by Carnegie Mellon and 
pick up their own expenses for 
travel and lodging.
Ilkar Baybars, an associate 
dean of GSIA, told The Pitts­
burgh Post Gazette on Wednes­
day that Levine was coming sim­
ply to have his ordeal talked about. 
“I think he’s looking for a podium 
to discuss these issues,” said Bay­
bars.
“We feel students benefit from 
the experience of a man who 
slipped little by little and eventu­
ally found himself in a dead end,” 
Baybars wrote in a memo to stu­
dents and faculty which explained 
the invitation to Levine. “He 
knows — and so do we — that he 
broke the law. We should have 
room for all in a university envi­
ronment.”
Nonetheless, the author of The 
Robber Barron’s article doesn’t 
think GSIA is the place for Lev­
ine.
Cindy Tomich, a first-year GSIA 
student and one of the five stu­
dents who published the newslet­
ter, said she has no idea who 
wrote the article.
“The idea behind The Robber 
Barrons is to present a forum 
where students can present any­
thing they want,” commented 
Tomich. “We will print anything 
as long as it is not morally offen­
sive.”
America’s corporate debt. He 
feared that without restraint in 
buyouts, a recession could cripple 
American competitiveness.
The other panelists disagreed 
in varying degrees with 
Proxmire’s views.
Duval called the LBO a neutral 
implement that could be used for 
good or bad depending on the 
buyer’s intentions. He felt that 
the free market should reign, but 
called for strict punishment of 
people who violate security laws.
Schuchert, whose livelihood 
depends on the buyout, was the 
strongest supporter of the action, 
saying, “The LBO is a phenome­
non whose time has come.”
Other topics debated by the 
panelists included the tax laws 
affecting buyouts, the ethics of 
greenmail and other takeover 
defenses, and the responsibilities 
of each player in a buyout at­
tempt.

Members of the Carnegie Mel­
lon Campus Security Department 
attended a training seminar Fri­
day at the University of Pitts­
burgh on ethnic intimidation, in­
stitutional vandalism, cultural 
awareness, and the Pennsylva­
nia Human Relations Act.
The officers underwent train­
ing after recent charges of racial 
harassment by black male stu­
dents on campus.
Speakers included Robert A. 
Clough of the Pennsylvania 
Human Relations Commission, 
who also moderated the discus­
sion throughout the day; Howard 
L. Ross, the regional director of 
the Anti-Defamation League of 
B’nai B’rith Hillel; Major Ben­
jamin Brooks of the Pennsylva­
nia State Police; CMU Police Chief 
James LaPaglia, representing the 
Pennsylvania Chiefs of Police 
Association; and John Hughes, of 
the U. S. Department of Justice.
The day’s discussion centered 
on helping officers to understand 
ethnic intimidation and how to 
recognize it, to recognize “hate 
groups” that target certain mi­
nority groups, to become more 
aware of cultural issues, and to 
better understand what might be

Carnegie Mellon Police Chief James LaPaglia speaks at a seminar on security-related human relations 
issues held at Pitt last Friday.
perceived by citizens as racial 
harassment.
Ethnic intimidation was ex­
plained as an offense that involves 
harassment or other kinds of 
crimes against individuals be­
cause of their race, color, religion, 
or national origin.
Officers were told to look for in­
dications of ethnic intimidation, 
but not to jump to conclusions too
quickly. “A racist note stuck to a 
dorm door is definitely not a 
prank,” warned Clough. “It’s a 
second degree misdemeanor.”
Clough also advised that offi­
cers not brush off incidents in­
volving fraternities.
The Anti-Defamation League of 
B’nai B’rith Hillel presented 
material concerning two groups 
commonly associated with acts of
racial insensitivity and ethnic 
intimidation: the Ku Klux Klan 
and Neo-Nazi Skinheads. Officers 
were told about the characteris­
tics that might help identify 
members of these groups, espe­
cially Skinheads, from people like 
heavy metal fans who might 
appear similar.
The representative from the 
Department of Justice, John
Hughes, illustrated the difference 
between monitoring and overre­
acting to a situation. “An overre­
action occurs when [an officer] 
.lets his emotions supercede his 
responsibility as a police officer,” 
he said.
LaPaglia summarized the situ­
ation that has recently developed 
regarding allegations of racial 
harassment in his department.
He told officers that he exam­
ined the underlying causes of the 
problems within the department 
and has established written guide­
lines for stopping suspicious per­
sons and investigating complaints 
against campus police officers.
LaPaglia told the officers that 
their presence and manner — 
body language, tone of voice, and 
courtesy — make very strong 
statements to people.
He warned officers not to ap­
proach any situation with an atti­
tude about the way a person might 
respond, because people will per­
ceive such an attitude and may 
respond that way because of it.
LaPaglia’s final words of advice 
were to treat any person “as you 
would one of your parents, or 
anyone else whom you respect.”
Officers attending the seminar 
agreed that it provided them with 
new ways of looking at some situ­
ations and gave them new and
valuable information for dealin 
with these kinds of »ituations.
CMU police office1 Bill Kaise 
agreed that many issues can bi 
improved through elucation, by 
that there are those that cannot 
He stressed that vhen dealim 
with racial attitude; on the cam 
pus, education can cnly go so far
“If those attitudes are to b‘ 
changed,” he said, ‘education 
not all that is going ti) be needed.
CMU officer Do-i Campbel 
agreed. He said he Ihought tha 
the education of the cimpus \vou]( 
be highly beneficial because thei 
people who report incidents wouli 
have some idea of hov to apprais* 
a situation.
LaPaglia told The Tartan tha 
all personnel in his jlepartmen 
either have had or an schedule! 
to receive this trainir'g.
In addition, the depirtmenthai 
contacted the US Department 
Justice to set up a special train 
ing session for CMU Campu 
Police, and the officeis from th 
department will atteid trainin 
given by the Allegheny Count 
District Attorney’s office, alon 
with officers from jDuquesn 
University and the University

Friday’s seminar was sponsore 
by the University of Pittsburg 
Police Department.One-time Carnegie Tech president John Warner dies at 91
continued from page 1
“He was a friendly, concerned 
person, a strikingly smart scien­
tist, and a very able administra­
tor who probably loved Carnegie 
Tech and Carnegie Mellon more 
than anything else in the world,” 
said current Senior Vice Presi­
dent Edward Schatz.
A Delta Upsilon brother, 
Warner came to Carnegie Tech in 
1926 as an instructor in chemis­
try. He gained prominence in the 
fields of physical chemistry and 
electrochemistry, and was the co­
author of six books and the au­
thor of many research papers.
For 12 years, Warner was on 
the general advisory committee 
of the U. S. Atomic Energy Com­
mission and was a member of the 
Policy Advisory Board of Argonne 
National Laboratory. He later 
served as a laboratory trustee.
He was also a member of the 
original Physical Sciences Advi­
sory Committee that planned the 
facilities and programs that would 
be created at the Brookhaven Na­
tional Laboratory.
In 1958, Warner served as the 
technical consultant to the U. N. 
International Conference on 
Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy.
He was chair of the organizing 
committee and first president of
the Universities’ Research Asso­
ciation, designer, builder and 
operator of the powerful particle 
accelerator at the Fermi Labora­
tory in Batavia, 111.
A member of the N ational Acad­
emy of Sciences, Warner received 
honorary degrees from 14 colleges 
and universities.
In 1986, Warner was elected to 
honorary life membership in the 
New York Academy of Sciences, a
distinction he shares with less 
than 150 other scientists.
Warner, who began his educa­
tion in a one-room school, received 
his bachelor’s degree in 1919, his 
master’s in 1920, and his doctor­
ate in 1923. All three came from 
Indiana University.
Following his retirement in 
1965, Warner was a member of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Board of Trus­
tees and was a consultant to sev­
eral foundations and corporation!
Warner lived at the Friendshi 
Village retirement center. Hi 
wife Louise died in 1981. He 
survived by two sons’,' Williai 
Hamer of Minneapolisi and Th( 
mas Payton of Holland, Mich 
gan, three grandchildren^ andfoii 
great-grandchildren.

vate. The family asks thatmem

McGraw, Roston disagree over presidential search committee
continued from page 1
Roston had asserted. “Of course 
people with such diverse back­
grounds are going to have con­
flicts but this white paper shows 
that students are able to over­
come petty personal differences 
and work for the betterment of 
CMU.”
Roston agreed that the commit­
tee had accomplished a great deal, 
as did Sinn and Bromberg. Sinn 
said that “In any organization as 
diverse as ours there is going to 
be debate, but that’s good in 
coming up with important issues. 
Overall, I think the committee 
has done a good job.”
Another conflict between 
McGraw and Roston stems from 
an accusation by McGraw that 
Roston inaccurately told Senate 
McGraw was supposed to poster 
for student input to the commit­
tee and failed to do so.
Bromberg, a CFA representa­
tive on Student Senate, confirmed 
that McGraw was to have pos­
tered and never did. However, 
Bromberg said she did not think 
Roston should have publicly 
blamed McGraw at last week’s 
Senate meeting.
Roston said that he did not make 
the statement to Senate and that 
there had been no plans to poster 
at the time in question.
McGraw attacked Roston’s criti­
cism of her and questioned his 
decision to seek the committee 
chairmanship since he is also 
running for Student Government 
President. She reported that “A 
couple of people told me that Marc 
Roston may be using this [the 
committee chairmanship] as a 
resumé builder. He has not been 
involved in many other organiza­
tions and he may be trying to 
create an illusion that things are 
terribly wrong and that he is 
coming in to save things and then 
apply this to his student body 
election.”
Roston denied that he had any 
ulterior motives in running for 
the committee chairmanship. “My 
interest in being the head of the 
committee comes from before I 
was interested in running for 
president.”
He also said that he is confident
that he will be able to find the 
time for both jobs because the 
major time commitments for the 
search committee are over.
Despite their differences, both 
McGraw and Roston agree that 
the disputes have not interfered 
with the functioning of the com­
mittee. Sinn and Bromberg con­
cur.
Although further nominations 
for the position of chair were to 
have been allowed at yesterday’s
search committee meeting, com­
mittee members agr eed that there 
probably would be no more nomi­
nations and that Roston would 
run unopposed.
Roston said that the next task 
before the committee is to obtain 
student input about the white 
paper before writing the final 
version. Roston hopes to have this 
version completed by the end of 
the semester but said that it could 
be delayed until early summer if
necessary because most of the 
committee members will be in 
Pittsburgh over the summer.
The final copy of the white paper 
will be made available to the 
University community through 
Andrew, the libraries, the Skibo 
information desk, and possibly by 
other means.
The purpose of the white paper, 
Roston said, was to allow the 
faculty to include student con­
cerns in the interviewing stan-
dards they are developing. The 
standards are intended to make 
meetings with presidential can­
didates as uniform as possible 
despite the fact that they will be 
conducted by a number of differ­
ent people.
When the list of candidates has 
been narrowed to the so called 
“short list” of about 10 candidates, 
the applicants will be sent the 
student white paper along with 
white papers written by the fac­
ulty and staff search committee 
and other information apoii 
Carnegie Mellon, such as cjlpie 
of The Tartan and The Word,
Members of the committee ar 
currently working with the Fac 
ulty Senate search committee 
be allowed to interview thfe candi 
dates on the short list.
However, it is not yetjknow 
whether the Board of Trustee! 
will consent to student interview 
of the candidates.

Greeks to present kickback petition, plan to Student Senate
continued from ott 1
The proposatself states that “while a 
few of us are Embers of some campus 
organizations,ie vast majority of us are 
not members,ir allowed to enjoy full 
membership ijsome of these organiza­
tions.”
But Ruben ¿agrees. “Every [funded] 
group that I low of has to be open to 
everyone,” hefays. “I don’t see where 
they’re cominfrom.”
The only e^ption to that rule, says 
Ruben, is thafunded buggy teams are 
allowed to de^ access to buggy-related 
secrets. He aciits, however, that “you’d 
be hard-presd to find that written down 
anywhere.”
The propod calls for kickback money 
to be used inFP and Panhel to support 
'events sucias Mr. Fraternity, Bas- 
ketBucks, Pie Sit, Greek Sing, Water­
melon Bashpnd] Greek Swing.” 
Currentlyiccording to Senate Fund­
ing and Reccnition Chair Frank DiVito, 
Student Serte advances money to sup­
port Greelevents open to the entire 
campus sue as those listed in the pro­
posal. |
Part of the motivation for the proposal 
may come from the fact that activities fee 
money is used to sponsor four buggy 
organizations: Pioneers, Carnegie In­
volvement Association (CIA), Fringe, and 
Spirit.
Saturday morning, Spirit again won 
the men’s sweepstakes competition, 
extending its claim over the trophy to 
three years. In addition, Spirit also cap­
tured this year’s women’s title.
According to public Student Senate 
records, $8647 is budgeted for the four 
buggy programs this year — a figure 
which includes a new buggy for Pio­
neers.
Senate fiscal policy mandates that an 
activities-fee sponsored buggy team can 
request a new buggy only once in three 
years, and must produce at least 10% of 
the cost from outside income.
Antonson says he hopes to acquire 300 
signatures — primarily from within the 
Greek system — on the petition he will 
present at tonight’s 7:00 Senate meet­
ing.
According to Antonson, the Student 
Government Constitution requires that
any petition with over 250 signatures be 
put on the next ballot. Spring elections 
will be held next Tuesday and Wednes­
day outside Doherty Hall.
But since the Greek proposal is what is 
classified as a “new proposal petition” — 
as opposed to a petition to block current 
Senate action — Ruben told The Tartan 
that Antonson may need to get a Senator 
to sponsor it.
Even if the issue is placed on the ballot 
and approved by the'student body as a 
whole, DiVito said that it may have to be 
approved by Carnegie Mellon’s Board of 
Trustees before it is implemented.
The text of the proposal follows.
Activities Fee Proposal 
Background Information:
Currently an $80 activities fee is paid 
to the university by all full time stu­
dents. Several years ago, it was decided 
that the graduate students at this uni­
versity were sufficiently different from 
the undergraduate students, and that 
the Activities Fee given to the clubs and 
organizations by the Student Senate was 
not reaching most of the graduate stu­
dents. Therefore, it was decided that the 
graduate student governing body (GSO) 
would receive 37% of the Activities Fee 
paid by graduate students, free to spend 
in any way it wishes.
Proposal:
The Council of Fraternity Presidents 
(CFP.).and Panhel feel that Greeks are in 
the same position as the graduate stu­
dents. While a few of us are members of 
some campus organizations, the vast 
majority of us are not members, or al­
lowed to enjoy full membership in some 
of these organizations. Our extent of use 
of the Activities Fee is limited mainly to 
campus films, lectures, and Spring Car­
nival events. The Student Activities Fee 
funded organizations also enjoy these 
subsidies of films, lectures, and Spring 
Carnival events. Thus, we think it makes 
sense for the Greek system to receive a 
percentage of the Activities Fee paid by 
the Greek students. As Greeks, we pay a 
significant percentage of the total Activi­
ties Fee, and are currently limited in 
how we can use it to subsidize our events.
We propose that:
1) During the early weeks of every 
semester enrollment information be used 
to determine the number of fraternity 
and sorority members at Carnegie Mel­
lon University.
2) The Greek Council be given 37% of 
the Activities Fee per semester for each 
of the fraternity and sorority members. 
This will be distributed to CFP and 
Panhel proportional to the number of 
members governed by each body (Panhel 
be given 37% of the Activities Fee per 
semester for each of the sorority sisters, 
CFP be given 37% of the Activities Fee 
per semester for each of the fraternity 
brothers).
3) The monies given to each governing 
body be applied to their budgets for that 
semester and all expenditures will be 
approved by CFP or Panhel. Events such 
as Mr. Fraternity, BasketBucks, Pole 
Sit, Greek Sing, Watermelon Bash, Greek 
Swing will be supported by these mo­
nies.
4) Any money left over from this fund 
at the end of the fiscal year will auto­
matically return to the Student Activi­
ties Fee account.

Problems in the Quad
The symptom: Greeks are upset 
about paying an activities fee.
The problem: Activities-fee funded 
buggies.
The solution: Not the proposed 37 
percent Greek activities fee kickback.
It’s a classic case of attacking a 
symptom rather than a problem...
Today, CFP President Phil Anton- 
son is expected to present Student 
Senate with a proposal from the 
Greek system outlining a plan to 
kick back 37 percent of all activities 
fees paid by fraternity and sorority 
members. Under the one-page pro­
posal, the money would go to CFA 
and Panhel proportional to the 
number ofstudentsgovemedby each.
This proposal would reduce the Stu­
dent Senate’s budget over $38,000 
annually, almost nine percent of the 
total money available to activities- 
fee sponsored organizations.
To make up for this reduction, the 
activities fee would have to be raised 
above its current $40 per semester, 
according to Assistant Dean of Stu­
dent Affairs Lois Cox.
The money re-channeled by the 
Greek proposal would be spent on 
events such as Mr. Fraternity, Bas- 
ketBucks, Pole Sit, Greek Sing, 
Watermelon Bash, and Greek Swing, 
events that are traditionally open to 
the whole campus. And, if there were 
any money left over at the end of the 
semester, it wouldbe returned to the 
activities fee account.
The problem with the current sys­
tem, the proposal argues, is that 
Greeks do not participate in non- 
Greek activities, except for “films, 
lectures, and Spring Carnival 
events.” Since students in activities 
fee-funded organizations both par­
ticipate in these and Greek events 
without paying Greek house dues, 
the Greeks are paying twice as much 
to be a part of the same social events: 
once when they pay their activities 
fees and once when they pay their 
Greek membership dues.
“Thus, we think it makes sense for 
the Greek system to receive a per­
centage of the activities fee paid by 
the Greek students,” the proposal 
reads. “As Greeks, we pay a signifi­
cant percentage of the total activi­
ties fee, and are currently limited in 
how we can use it to subsidize our 
events.”
As it is written, the Greek argu­
ment rests on the assertion that 
Greeks do not participate in non- 
Greek activities, an assertion that is 
simply not true. While there are 
undoubtedly fewer Greeks in non- 
Greek organizations, the proposal’s 
blanket statement is ludicrous: ev­
ery maj or organization—from AB to 
The Tartan to WRCT to Student 
Senate — has Greek members.
That argument, however, is sim­
ply a convenient screen that the 
Greeks are using to hide behind. The 
actual reason the Greeks want a 
kickback is because Student Senate 
is spending about $9,000 a year to 
support four non-Greek buggy pro­
grams. And one of those programs — 
Spirit — is winning consistently.
According to Senate fiscal policy, 
an sponsored buggy team can re­
quest a new buggy once every three 
years and must raise at least 10 
percent of the cost from other sources.
Next year, Senate will give buggy- 
money to Pioneers, Carnegie Involve­
ment Association, Fringe, and Spirit, 
including a new buggy for Pioneers.
The Greek system is outraged that 
its activities fee money is helping 
construct these rival buggies.
And it should be.
No organization, no matter how 
“poor,” should be given money to build 
buggies from the activities fee. Buggy 
is too competitive. It is no longer a 
friendly engineering exhibition; 
buggy is a cut-throat competition 
with winners and losers.
On the other hand, buggy is in­
credibly expensive, in some cases 
almost prohibitively expensive for 
new or small organizations. Almost. 
As Pioneers showed two years ago, a 
fledgling, poor organization can put 
together a competitive buggy capable 
of winning design. The Pioneers 
showed that people — not piles of 
money — produce winning buggies.
However, until the Greeks drop 
their current argument, little prog­
ress is going to be made toward a 
solution to the problem of activities- 
fee funded buggies. Rather than force 
an unpopular proposal through 
Senate, the Greeks should work with 
Senate to rewrite the fiscal policy.
In fact, the Greeks should work 
with Senate more in general. For 
example, some Greek activities are 
truly open and the Greeks should be 
able and willing to go to Senate for 
special allocations, the same way a 
non-funded organization gets money.
This process is established, a proc­
ess where one group of elected repre­
sentatives controls and allocates all 
the money. Who controls the money 
under the Greek proposal? Where 
are the checks and balances?
And is it right to make the whole 
campus pay for Greek events through 
increased activities fees?
More importantly, however, is the 
widened gap between Greeks and 
non-Greeks under the proposal. In­
stead of a diverse student body, it 
creates two diverse student bodies 
— one Greek and one non-Greek — 
clearly marked by economic borders. 
This segregation may be the great­
est danger behind this proposal.
The Greek kickback is a bad idea.

Stats head defends BA/BS degrees and department
Editor:
I am writing to provide some clarifica­
tion concerning the recent furor over BA 
degree programs in H&SS and to correct 
some misconceptions concerning the 
teaching done by the Department of 
Statistics. In a Tartan headline “news” 
story [“BA future uncertain after H&SS 
Council” 3/7], your reporter quoted ex­
cerpts from a Student Union editorial 
written by Matt Ruben which created a 
campus-wide impression that Dean Fien- 
berg is advocating degree requirements 
to create work for the Statistics Depart­
ment. Apparently, Matt Ruben believes 
we have little teaching to do, because we 
have only one statistics major. I do not 
object to Matt Ruben espousing a con­
spiracy theory with no factual basis; at 
least this was clearly an opinion piece. 
On the other hand, The Tartan chose to 
print a news article, and so implicitly 
gave some credence to Ruben’s theory. 
The sad thing is that all this discussion 
of Statistics Department teaching loads 
and the confidentiality of H&SS College 
Council meeting has diverted attention 
away from the vital issue of the appropri­
ateness of particular degree require­
ments for CMU degree programs.
Let me first discuss the teaching done 
by the Statistics Department. Data from 
the Planning Office shows that in 1986 
and 1987, the Statistics Department 
ranked third (behind Mathematics and 
ECE) out of twenty-six teaching units on 
campus as measured by course unit 
taught per instructional faculty mem­
ber. In 1988, my department ranked 
sixth (behind Mathematics, ECE, GSIA, 
SUPA, and History) using this measure. 
This measure is not perfect and depends 
on many factors ranging from class sizes, 
department teaching loads and whether
Letters to the Editor
or not graduate students teach courses. 
I cite these figures merely to assure the 
campus that the Statistics Department 
is carrying more than its share of the 
overall CMU teaching load.
A second issue concerned the number 
of statistics majors. Matt Ruben is cor­
rect that there is typically one H&SS 
Statistics major each year. Neverthe­
less, he either does not know or chooses 
to ignore the statistics majors in the 
MCS applied mathematics program and 
the operations research majors in that 
same program who are within one semi­
nar of having the full statistics major. In 
addition, he ignores the double majors 
and our substantial graduate program. 
The 1988 CMU Commencement Program 
reveals nine undergraduate students 
with statistics majors and an additional 
twenty receiving operations research 
degrees. By way of comparison, there 
were twenty-four students receiving ei­
ther a major or a double major in history. 
I cite the figures for the History Depart­
ment, because it is widely regarded as an 
outstanding department both in the 
quantity and the quality of the teaching 
it does.
I must also point out that our depart­
ment prides itself on working with other 
departments to create offerings tailored 
to particular degree programs. During 
the last two years we have introduced 
courses in quality control and industrial 
statistics for CIT students, biostatistics 
for the biomedical engineering program, 
statistics for the graduate students in 
psychology and behavioral sciences, and 
a new version of our course for under­
graduates in ECE. We may eventually 
have to create a new course for the social 
science history degree.
Returning to the issue of BA degrees in 
H&SS, I know of no member of College 
Council who does not strongly support 
BA degree programs. I have a BA degree 
and value it very highly. Dean Fienberg 
is also a strong advocate of BA degrees 
and has made the development of mod­
ern languages one of his priorities for 
H&SS. His arguments for adding quan­
titative courses to the social science his­
tory major are based on his expertise a 
an internationally acclaimed social sci­
entist and should not be taken as apply­
ing to any other program.
The Carnegie Mellon curriculum we- 
offer is the result of much debate among 
faculty, but would greatly benefit from 
sustained student input and construc­
tive student criticism. I am constantly 
impressed by the quality of feedback and 
the excellent suggestions students £ 
me in my midsemester teaching evalu­
ations. I am certain that students would 
also offer excellent feedback on the (cur­
riculum; however, there is no organized 
means for them to offer such feedback. I 
believe that we should work toward 
greater student involvement in these 
matters. In the meantime, all students 
should be encouraged to discuss their 
ideas with any member of their respec­
tive College Council. The Tartan could 
provide a useful forum for discussion of 
the Carnegie Mellon curriculum, but 
your news reporters should check the 
relevant facts before printing baseless 
theories about any administrator’s mo­
tives.

Student says S ‘n’ S riddled with problems
This is an open letter written to the 
members of Scotch ‘n’ Soda. The author 
chose to have it printed in The Tartan so 
that his grievances would be made known 
to the general student body. —Ed.
Scotch ‘n’ Soda Members:
I am writing to you in regard to the 
upcoming Scotch ‘n’ Soda elections to be 
held on the second day of strike [taking 
down the set], or Tuesday, April 18,1989. 
I would very much appreciate your vote 
for president of Scotch ‘n’ Soda, as I feel 
I have a lot to offer the organization; 
however, I feel I must first explain my 
recent departure from the cast of the 
spring production, as I’m sure no one 
else endeavored to do so.
I have too much pride and integrity to 
be involved with any organization whose 
administration displays such a flagrant 
disregard for what is for the “good of its 
members” and functions primarily on 
personally motivated intentions. If 
elected president for the 1989-90 term, 
you can be assured that such behaviors 
will not be characteristic of my perform­
ance in office; from this you may infer 
what you will about the current admini­
stration. As president, I offer the follow­
ing pledges:
I will not base the delegation of author­
ity, directorial decisions, editorial deci­
sions, casting decisions, or any other 
policies on personal motivations and/or 
relationships within a clique.
I will not determine which scenes to 
shorten or cut in a production based on 
who wrote them, who directed them,
•] have too much pride ... to be involved with 
an organization whose administration displays 
such a flagrant disregard for what is ‘for the 
good of its members' and functions primarily 
on personally motivated intentions.”
and/or who is acting in them, but rather 
on their relevance to the production as a 
whole and a collaborative evaluation of 
their quality (both of the writing and 
acting). Again, personal motivations and 
relationships within a clique will not be 
a factor.
I will not have a tantrum when my 
work (assuming I have the opportunity 
to write and contribute something) is 
shortened or cut from a production; as I 
have already stated, such decisions will 
be a collaborative effort.
I will not violate any or all regulations 
of the Scotch ‘n’ Soda constitution and/or 
established guidelines governing the 
organization of productions; i.e. writers 
are not permitted to act in their own 
scenes, writers are not permitted to di­
rect their own scenes, and directors are 
not permitted to act in their own scenes. 
Further, I will not utilize a-constitution 
as vague and misleading as the current 
document; I will not permit “floating 
membership” based solely upon whether 
one is currently involved with a produc­
tion.
Further, all guidelines and contrac-
tual agreements will be made perfectly 
clear before said agreements are entered 
into, and policies will not be altered 
midway through productions or to suit 
the personal needs of an individual at 
any given time.
I will not make claims that “anyone 
who regularly attends acting workshops 
will be guaranteed a part in the spring 
show as it will be an ensemble effort; 
certainly I do not believe such a policy'5 
a reasonable one; however, I believe such 
claims must be honored once made- 
(Incidentally, there is an incredibly larg< 
portion of the student body that feel5 
ostracized by the current Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
administration and does not feel 
come to return, least ofj all a desire to 
participate in the future; if nothing else' 
I make the promise that those student-' 
will be made to feel welcome to return to 
Scotch ‘n’ Soda given the assurance that 
policies will again be based on talent and 
“the good of the show.”)
I will not practice policies of deceij 
when dealing with cast members i 
any problems that arise.

Inquiring on Carnival
Inquiring Minds
Stew Levine
After a semester of training for 
buggy, a month of buildingbooths, 
and three days of Spring Cami- 
, my mind is only capable of 
these random thoughts about the 
event:
Once again, the Gravitron was 
ilaced too close to the APhiO 
concession stand.
Don’t party with returning 
alumni, they do not have to get up 
early as you do.
' The best view of the Midway 
tame from the top of the Super- 
loops ride.
I was embarrassed to find 
myself humming the tune from 
my game of Simon at the Sig Tau 
booth after I’d played.
Going to sleep at 4:00 after a 
party really is not good for you...
.. .Especially if you have to get 
up for buggy at 4:30.
Didn’t Spirit’s celebration 
after winning Sweepstakes vio­
late Carnegie Mellon’s policy on 
drinking alcohol in public places?
If Phi Kap’s booth had had a 
bathroom, I would have signed a 
lease.
• Having the concert on Sun- 
ly was agreatidea. Butimagine 
how many more people would 
have gone if they had been awake 
or sober for it.
More alumni seem to come 
back for Carnival than for Home­
coming. Is that because they don’t
rhe race for equality is leading to more racism

Carnival?
• After two years of races threat­
ened by bad weather, Buggy went 
off with almost no delays. Does 
that mean that Sweepstakes 
Chair Chris Hansen sold his soul 
for dry weather?
• SAE’s Limo again trailed the 
pack, despite a valiant effort by 
PiLam’s Miss Bud to take last 
place. In the time it took Limo to 
make it around, Quantum Leap 
would have done the course two 
full times and made it as far as 
the Hill 4-5 exchange on lap three.
• Not one team had “Push It” 
or “Run Like Hell” as a psych 
song, believe it or not.
• Maybe it was the clouds on 
Saturday, but for the first time 
Midway did not look like “Inva­
sion of the Hair-Sprayed Teen­
agers.”
• Ihadnever heard of anyofthe 
entertainment, despite the uni­
form quality, in the Tent.
• You had to love WRCT’s Car­
nival shirt, showing its one staff- 
member, Les Nessman, who had 
moved on to a larger radio sta­
tion.
• It is probably impossible to 
come up with a theme for Carni­
val such that Pika will not be able 
to use it’s Batman booth.

2o affirmative action working.
Since Carnival was last week­
end, I was planning to write a 
light, upbeat column about it this 
week. However, on Friday I found 
out that something had happened 
:o me that should never happen 
:o any person. I was turned down 
or a summer job, and there is a 
[ood Chance that it was because 
)f the color of my skin.
I am white and my racial back­
ground is Eastern European 
Jewish.
The job for which I applied was 
in internship at a large company 
n Chicago. When I interviewed 
or the job I was told that there 
ivere about ten applicants for one 
ir two positions. Based on this, I 
ealized that there was a good 
:hance that I would not get the 
ob.
I was also told that because the 
flmpany could receive federal 
unding if it hired a minority
person, I was really only compet­
ing for one position at most. The 
company could not afford to hire 
two interns without the govern­
ment money and was not sure 
that it could afford to hire even 
one non-minority applicant.
I do not hold any hard feelings 
against the company or the indi­
viduals who made the decision 
not to hire me. They have to look 
out for their financial interests 
and it just does not make sense to 
hire a white male applicant and 
pay his full salary if a similarly 
qualified minority applicant can 
be hired for less money out of the 
company’s pocket.
I also do not know for sure that 
I would have gotten the job even if 
the federal subsidy had not been 
available. However, the money 
was available and that meant that 
I was put at a disadvantage be­
cause of my race. This is the part 
of the story which bothers me. I 
was denied equal opportunity for 
a job because of government spon­
sored discrimination.
“...affirmative action ...is intended to 
compensate minorities for the racism 
that was practiced against them...”
I know the argument for af­
firmative action. It is intended to 
compensate minorities for the 
racism that was practiced against 
them for most of this country’s 
history. I am honestly sympa­
thetic, but what is gained by tak­
ing a job away from a 20-year-old? 
I did not participate in creating or 
perpetuating the racism. In fact, 
I feel I can say with a clear con­
science that I have used the re­
sources at my disposal, including 
my vote, my money, and my abil­
ity to reason with others, to work 
against racial injustice. I will not 
deny that I could do more, but I 
believe that I have made more 
than a reasonable effort.
I am glad that the United States 
finally seems to have its heart in 
the right place on the issue of
racism, but the policy it has cho­
sen to follow is wrong. The federal 
government should be spending 
its money to work towards true 
equality, not simply to change the 
focus of the inequality. If more 
money is needed to do the job 
effectively, I will pay my share. 
But I refuse to support racism 
against any group or individual.
I will conclude with two simple 
questions for anyone who still has 
any doubt that affirmative action 
programs are wrong. Do you be­
lieve that it is right to deny a 
person equal opportunity on the 
basis of race? If not, why does it 
matter which race?

Buchwald interviews the king of the peppercorn grinders
It wasn’t a serious problem 
¡efore, but it has now become a 
¡risis. No restaurant worth its 
jalt would let you put pepper on 
four own food. One reason for 
his is that waiters in the United 
States connot be licensed to serve 
meal unless they are able to 
•perate a nine-foot pepper 
irinder.
In order to handle the demand 
ij qualified grinders, pepper 
chools are springingup all across 
he land. Their function is to teach 
tudents the art of using a pepper 
nill in a public place. This in­
cludes spraying everything from 
alads to smoked salmon. A great 
eal of curriculum is also devoted 
safety.
Pierre au Poivre, the Isaac 
»tern of pepper grinders, told me, 
You have to have nerves of steel
Art Buchwald
to be in this business.
“Most accidents are caused 
when an incompetent person us­
ing a pepper mill misses the salad 
and hits the diner in the nose or 
on the head. In the wrong hands, 
a pepper mill is considered a le­
thal weapon, and we need all the 
guidlines we can get to prevent 
serious injury.
“Probably the most important 
point to remember when holding 
a pepper grinder is to keep it at a 
45-degree angle. If you raise it 
any higher, you could shoot it into 
someones eyes. If you hold it any 
lower, the pepper will fall into the 
customer’s shoes. Next comes — 
‘twisting the mill.’ The twist of

the wrist is what distinguishes 
the great grinders from the medi­
ocre ones.”
“Is that all there is to it?” I 
asked.
“You must also practice, I de­
vote five hours a day to my art. 
My wife makes 34 pounds of 
Caesar salad every morning for 
me to train on. But, it has all been 
worth it.”
Pierre said that there are many 
waiters aspiring to be pepper 
grinders who just don’t have it.
“Why is that?” I wanted to 
know.
“Because they close their eyes 
when they put the pepper on. We 
call it ‘Fear of Sprinkling.’ ”
“I know that this is a silly ques­
tion, but what are the advantages 
of having a waiter do your pepper 
grinding for you?”
“It’s a once in a lifetime gastro­
nomic experience. We live in a 
very frenetic world, and most 
people don’t have the time to put 
pepper on their food. If you are 
dining at a restaurant which 
provides such a service, you know 
that you are in a classy joint, even 
if the food tastes like bicycle tires.” 
Pierre felt that everything in 
pepper grinding is timing.
“My favorite maneuver is to 
hide behind a palm tree. I wait 
until someone starts to tell a story 
and just when he gets to the punch 
line, I jump out with my mill at 
the ready, and yell ‘PEPPER.’ ”
“It takes a real pro to ruin 
someone’s joke.”
“I also like to grind pepper just 
when a man is proposing mar­
riage to a girl or when a couple is 
breaking up. It makes me feel 
what I’m doing has some value.” 
He continued, “Recently, I have 
observed that people are starting 
to grind their own pepper. They 
have no class, and are the same 
ones who insist on putting gas in 
their own tanks. Nevertheless, 
restaurants are no longer ignor­
ing them and are setting aside a 
special section for do-it-yourself 
pepper grinding, and another one 
where waiters provide the serv­
ice.”
The greatest criticism heard 
about self-grinders, is that they 
are inexperienced and badly 
trained. Many hold the grinder 
upside down and wind up shoot­
ing peppercorn dust at everyone 
in the room.
I asked Pierre if he owned his 
own pepper grinder.
“Every great waiter does,” he 
replied. Mine was crafted by 
Antonio Stradivari, the celebrated 
pepper mill maker from Cre­
mona.”
“Why is it so valuable?” 
“Because of the pure sound it 
makes when the pepper hits the 
lettuce.”

Incidentally, perhaps this would 
be an appropriate place to elabo­
rate upon the specific reason for 
quitting the cast a few weeks ago. 
Upon forwarding a letter to the 
Scotch ‘n’ Soda board protesting 
the cuts in certain scenes, I was 
told there was no problem with 
what I was requesting and that 
they were glad I had brought it to 
their attention. However, as most 
of you will recall, there was a 
rehearsal where we all sat around 
and “talked” about the problems 
Scotch ‘n’ Soda was having and 
received a “lecture” on poor atti­
tudes, etc. One topic that was dis­
cussed was those cast members 
who complain about their scenes 
being cut because they have “the 
biggest egos” our current presi­
dent has ever seen. Well, having 
written the letter I did, I picked 
up certain phrases and comments 
that were obviously directed at 
me. I still do not understand why 
I was not told to my face that my 
request was such a tremendous 
problem; you’ll remember we were 
threatened with possible cancel­
lation of the show.
Anyway, because Amanda 
Cohen was having problems with 
Scotch ‘n’ Soda at the same time, 
we scheduled a meeting to speak 
with the board together. How­
ever, the day of the meeting, the 
president of Scotch ‘n’ Soda called 
me and we talked for almost an 
hour about various problems; I 
was told that the meeting that 
afternoon was to be between her­
self and and Amanda Cohen and 
no one else. Further, she stated 
that she did not want other board 
members there because two of 
them were no longer directors but 
regular cast members, and the 
head directors had too many other 
things to deal with.
As president, she wanted to 
handle it herself. As it turns out, 
the meeting was with Amanda 
Cohen and at least six board 
members, including the lighting 
director. When Amanda went to 
look for me, still thinking I was 
coming, no one bothered to tell 
her that they had already spoke 
with me. When I confronted the 
current president, she stated that 
the other board members had 
asked to be there. Please permit 
me to differ with her: I find it 
difficult to believe that the light­
ing director begged to attend that 
meeting; no one would have 
known about the meeting if she 
had not informed them. Even if 
they had found out, she told me 
she did not want them there and 
should have told them the same 
thing. If she had changed her mind 
and wanted them there, she had 
an obligation to contact me, as 
that was the original plan for the 
meeting.
As I have already stated, I 
cannot condone lying in any form, 
particularly not by an organiza­
tion administration. Believe me, 
I do not expect anyone to adirfi£ to 
what I have expressed here, but 
please remember that I had abso­
lutely nothing- to gain by drop­
ping out of the show except three 
months of wasted evenings. In 
other words, believe what you will, 
but I have absolutely no reason to 
fabricate or exaggerate any of this, 
and I am asking you to give it 
some serious consideration when 
voting next week.
I will not delegate creative 
control to one person, but will 
maintain a consistent collabora­
tive environment, including the 
consultation of all contributing 
writers and all directors.
Further, I will have a board of 
directors who will be responsible 
for casting decisions and overall 
production decision; these direc­
tors will not be actors and obvi­
ously will not cast themselves in 
the roles of their choosing in any 
given production. Also, I will not 
permit unnecessary changes to 
be made in submitted scripts, 
particularly changes that are 
personally motivated.
Writers will be consulted for 
editorial changes and will have 
written contracts explaining all 
of their rights. Scotch ‘n’ Soda Will 
regain the level of professional­
ism it once had if I am elected 
president.
Please permit me a few more 
words in summary. Scotch ‘n’ Soda 
is a very important organization, 
not only to me, but to all of you, 
and to many other students at 
this University. It is extremely 
unfortunate that many students 
do not feel welcome to participate 
in this organization (myself in­
cluded) because of the current 
administration and its misguided 
policies. Scotch ‘n’ Soda is sup­
posed to be fun, primarily; after 
all, members don’t pay dues, so 
there must be some other reason 
for staying involved. However, 
that enjoyment was lost some­
where along the way, and it des­
perately needs to be regained. This 
organization is supposed to pro­
vide a creative outlet for non-Fine 
Arts majors, yet it has somehow 
become a haven for a clique of 
board members who wish to ac­
quire more authority than is theirs 
to claim and creative control over 
aspects that should be left for the 
members-at-large to become in­
volved with.
In short, I have a personal stake 
in this organization and in this 
election. I don’t want what hap­
pened to them to happen to any­
one else, and it . shouldn’t. It 
doesn’t have to.
Scotch ‘n’ Soda must be reo­
pened to all of those students who 
feel they have been pushed away 
from it. These students, all stu­
dents, have a right to be involved 
and to be treated with the respect 
and fairness they deserve. Scotch 
‘n’ Soda is very important to me, 
otherwise I would not be running 
for the presidency or explaining 
all of this to you.
You have a right to know what 
is going on, and since the current 
administration apparently does 
not wish to do so, I felt a need to 
share these things with you. As 
president, another pledge I make 
is that you, as members, will be 
kept informed consistently and 
honestly.
Please understand that I did 
not quit the spring show for no 
reason; I was lied to and deceived 
and could not remain a part of 
such an organization, regardless 
of whether the current admini­
stration admits it or not. I do not 
expect them to. Again, I want to 
make sure this does not happen 
again; no one should be made to 
feel that they are not welcome to 
participate in any student organi­
zation, particularly not one that 
has the potential to offer as much 
as Scotch ‘n’ Soda.
When confronted with these 
problems and grievances, your 
current president made the state­
ment, and I quote: “Well, there’s 
always next year.” Though that is 
a very casual attitude to possess 
when so many students are in­
volved and so many mistakes have 
been made, it.is true in one re­
gard.
Next year can be different, next 
year can be better. That is why I 
am asking you to elect me as the 
1989-90 president of Scotch ‘n’ 
Soda (and, incidentally, I have 
considerable experience in high 
school and college leadership 
positions). I want to make those 
changes happen, and I know I can 
do that.
You have my pledge to serve 
you honestly and fairly (and you 
even have it in writing so that 
next year I can be held account­
able to my promises). I ask that 
you consider all that I have said 
with an open mind and believe 
that what I say is true. I only 
want what is best for Scotch ‘n’ 
Soda, as I know you do, and I 
know that I can make these prom­
ises a reality, with your vote.
If I am elected president, Scotch 
‘n’ Soda will again be an organiza­
tion you can feel welcome and 
proud to belong to.
If you have any questions, 
please feel free to contact me at 
268-4653.
Best of luck for a stellar per­
formance, and congratulations, in 
advance, for a job well done!

Buggy was fun? 
Say it ain’t so
A lot of people are expecting 
my annual “Buggy Bitch” 
column. You know, it’s the one 
where I just crack off com­
plaints about the whole idea of 
' buggy itself for several (well 
constructed) paragraphs. Well, I 
must admit that not only is 
such a column not forthcoming, 
it is also not necessary.
With the exception of the 
Alumni races getting cancelled 
due to the weather, Sweep­
stakes ’89 went off without a 
hitch. All races were on time 
and all protests and complaints 
were handled in a quick, deci­
sive manner. As a spectator and 
former competitor (hill #1, pal),
I was impressed and pleased 
with the entire operation.
As usual, the competitive 
spirit caused some individuals 
and organizations to get a bit 
“testy.” However, the overall 
enthusiasm never degenerated 
down to the level of childishness 
it has in years past, even 
though it easily could have. 
Chairman Chris Hansen says 
that everyone involved with 
buggy “... shares a brain.”
That’s true, but this year 
everyone seemed to wise up a 
little, or maybe grow up a little.
Thanks SAE, PiLam, and 
Beta for a hilarious heat 7a. 
Watching the “Dead Heads” 
push Limo while getting beaten 
about the head and neck area 
by “cops” helped re-establish 
the fact that buggy is first and 
foremost a fun activity.
The other big competition at 
Carnival is booth. Ironically, 
"where the competitive spirit is 
Soften a detriment in buggy, in 
rbooth, competition causes the 
«groups to do some very wonder­
ful things. By far, this is one of 
• the best years ever for booth. So 
many of them were designed 
and built so well. I did not envy 
.the judges this year, especially 
:with the fraternity division.
Z Behind all the plywood, paint,
1’ and really cool t-shirts, there is 
-a seedy side to booth. At times, I 
could not differentiate between 
buggy push teams and booth 
paint crews when it came to 
tension levels. But the tension 
with booth is a bit more self- 
contained than it is with buggy.
In buggy, the tension is often 
between two separate organiza­
tions. Also, some people enjoy 
buggy so much and get so 
involved that they sacrifice 
other parts of their lives 
. (mainly school) in order to 
! compete. In booth, the problems 
i often generate inside the group 
j or house. People complain about 
i those in charge, and those in 
charge feel like they have to do 
! all the work and get a bit 
“bossy.” Often, preparing for 
and building a booth seems like 
more trouble than it is worth.
Since this is Carnival, though, 
and the true chance for groups 
. to show themselves off to each 
other and the rest of the city, 
the little extra adrenaline 
needed in the wee hours of the 
morning is often easy to tap out.
I once worked for a carnival 
for a few weeks and can hon­
estly say that, for its size, 
Spring Carnival ’89 was great.
A good carnival is one where 
you run out of time before you 
run out of things to do. I was so 
busy that I never got to ride the 
I Gravitron this year. Maybe 
1 that’s a blessing though, be- 
; cause I really filled up on the 
! funnel cakes. Damn, I’m gonna 
miss those things.

The IM floor hockey champion­
ship games were held in both the 
major and the minor divisions 
last Wednesday. The night was 
one of hard hits, tough losses, and 
repeating winners. The minors 
game was a rematch between 
Theta Xi B and the Moose Jaw 
Warriors, and the majors was 
between Todd Rockoff and the 
Zoo. Moose Jaw and Todd Rockoff 
went away with the champion­
ship trophies, winning 5-3 and 7- 
3, respectively.
The first period of the minors 
game started out with intense 
defensive playing. Neither team 
could get a clear shot on goal for 
over the first half of the period.
With four minutes left on the 
clock, the Moose Jaw Warriors 
started putting the offensive pres­
sure on and Jim White scored 
from five feet out to give Moose 
Jaw a one point lead. The teams 
were scoreless for the rest of the 
first period.
In the second period, thirty sec­
onds had passed when Moose Jaw 
scored again. Scott Manning 
scored the first of his two goals 
giving his team a 2-0 lead. For the 
next four minutes, Theta Xi had 
only one shot on goal.
With 7:30 left in the second 
period, Manning sunk his second 
goal of the night to give Moose 
Jaw a three point advantage. 
Theta Xi tried to score at least one 
point before the period closed*, 
but they were unsuccessful in 
their attempts, and the second 
period closed with Moose Jaw 
ahead by a score of 3-0.
Halfway through the third pe­
riod, Moose Jaw increased their 
lead to four. Two minutes later, 
Theta Xi scored their first goal on 
a slapshot by Mike Ference.
White broke away from the 
crowd and went one-on-one with 
the Theta Xi goalie, taking a shot 
from a couple of feet out. It hit the 
goalie’s leg, bounced off and was
accidently brushed in by the 
goalie’s glove. The goal counted, 
and Moose Jaw was up by four 
again, 5-1.
At the 3:30 mark, Paul Byrne 
scored his first goal for Theta Xi, 
cutting the Moose Jaw lead down 
to three. Byrne scored his second 
goal a minute and a half later.
The game ended in a 5-3 victory 
for the Moose Jaw Warriors.
Fifteen minutes after the mi­
nors championship had ended, the 
IM majors game started.
Todd Rockoff took the early lead 
on a power play goal by Gary 
Kein, his first of two.lt was his 
second shot that caused a contro­
versy. The Zoo claimed that a 
Todd Rockoff player had kicked 
the puck into the net while he was 
in front of the net fighting for con­
trol, while Kein stated that he 
had shot the puck with his stick 
and that it had bounced off of one 
of his teammates. The initial call 
from the referees stuck, and Todd 
Rockoff took a two point lead.
Another Todd Rockoff goal early 
in the second period gave the team 
a comfortable three point lead. 
With 6:30 left in the period, the 
Zoo scored their first goal off a 
slapshot from Peter Wolcott. Two 
minutes later, Todd Rockoff (the 
player that the team was named 
after) scored, reinstating the Todd 
Rockoff three point lead.
With two minutes left in the pe­
riod, James Shaw of the Zoo, 
scored for his team cutting the 
Todd Rockoff lead down to two. 
The period ended with the score 
at 4-2 in favor of Todd Rockoff.
The third period started with 
Allan Heyden scoring for Todd 
Rockoff. Three minutes passed 
before Todd Rockoff increased 
their lead to four with a slapshot 
by Eric Nyberg.
With four minutes left to play 
in the third period, the Zoo scored 
their final goal of the game with a 
midcourt shot by defenseman 
Mark Wabalas. A minute later, 
Todd Rockoff clinched their vic­
tory with a goal by Sean Smith.
Tennis goes 1-1 against 
non-league opponents
By NATALIE HAWRYLUK
Tartan Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team split a pair of 
matches against non-league 
Westminster College and Fair­
mont State last week. The 
Tartans lost last Tuesday to 
Fairmont State, 5-4, but came 
back strong on Thursday and 
swept Westminster, 8-0.
After losing the first four 
singles matches against Fair­
mont State, the Tartan num­
ber five and number six play­
ers, Nicolas Sagna and Matt 
Davis salvaged two victories. 
The number one doubles team, 
Graham McAfee and Keith Gru- 
met, and the number two team, 
Darin Kaplan and Jay Stevens, 
won their matches to tie the 
score at 4-4. That’s where 
CMU’s luck ran out. The num­
ber three doubles team of Davis 
and Sagna lost their match, 7- 
6, 7-6.
“We aren’t at all upset about 
our loss to Fairmont. They’re a 
tough Division I team, and they 
beat Pitt, 8-1. We weren’t ex­
pecting to take more than two 
matches. It was great to get as 
close as we did,” said Kaplan.
Thursday, the Tartans routed 
Westminster College, 8-0.
“The team played really well. 
Two years ago, we played West­
minster, and we got beaten 
pretty badly,” said Stevens.
Everyone who played a match 
won. Stevens had to forfeit his 
doubles match due to an ankle 
injury during his singles match.
“A lot of credit should go to 
Coach Scheines. He works us 
hard, and people are reacting 
positively to it. People are 
motivated for tournament 
play,” commented McAfee.
The team meets Grove City 
on Wednesday, and travels to 
Atlanta this weekend for the 
University Athletic Association 
Championships.
Men’s track has poor outing 
at California Invitational
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
Carnegie Mellon men’s track 
and field had a difficult weekend 
at the California Invitational Sat­
urday. The Tartans competed at 
California, PA against teams from 
California, Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania, Frostburg State, 
Pitt, Glenville State and West 
Virginia Wesleyan. In this com­
petition, only four members of the 
team placed.
Jeff Illian captured the highest
place of any team member with a 
top finish in the 100 m dash with 
a time of 11.02. Illian pulled his 
hamstring in the 200 m dash.
Dave Supp finished second in 
the 5000 m run with a time of 
15.03 minutes. Pat Noll was right 
on Supp’s heels in this race, tak­
ing third in 15.22.
Len O’Neal placed in two races, 
placing fourth in 1.57 in the 800 
m and fifth in the 1500 m in 4.05.
According to O’Neal, “the team 
didn't fare well. At most, half of 
the team was there.”

Carnegie Mellon: The Bad News Bears of Lacrosse
By KARYN SILVA
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
In a rough and tumble sea­
son, the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
lacrosse team is trying to pull 
out from under. With an 0-4 
record, the lacrosse team is 
starting to improve, but with­
out any results in the stand­
ings.
Co-Captain John Kim de­
scribes his team as, “the Bad 
News Bears.”
Last Saturday, the Tartans 
played against one of the best 
teams in their league, St. Vin­
cent’s. Carnival’s competitive­
ness touched the lacrosse team, 
but the same luck that brought 
Spirit its victories wasn’t there,
and the lacrosse team lost, 14-4.
High scorers throughout the 
season have been Rob Kendall, 
Scott Johnson and Peter Vonder- 
lieth. They brought the team to 
close games against other league
members Pitt and Alleghei 
College.
Even with their lack of wii 
CMU lacrosse is high in enti 
tainment value. According 
captain John Kim, “We plaj 
tough. We’re a lot of fun to wat( 
We really need fans to suppoi 
us.”
The team, also suffering froifl 
a lack of playing space, prai 
tices on the Cut on Tuesday 
and Thursdays. Kim cites thf 
the members are definite!

All-Americoach???
After 20 years of coaching track at CMU 
Meckley still loves what he’s doing
By RICHARD SHIPLEY
Tartan Staff writer
Carnegie Mellon University, 
home of supercomputing, nerds, 
hackers, former high school vale­
dictorians, defense contracts, and 
controversy, has one of the “win- 
ningest” coaches in NCAA his­
tory. What, one of the winningest 
coaches in NCAA history? Yes, 
Gary Meckley, head cross-coun- 
try/track-and field coach of the 
Carnegie Mellon Tartans, has 
produced winning teams in spite 
of the skyrocketing cost of Carne­
gie Mellon ($17,500 in 1988, for 
an entering freshman) and the 
extremely competitive academic 
admission standards.
To Meckley’s credit are a 334- 
47 career win/loss record, 29 
championships, seven All-Ameri­
cans, and an NCAA record — to a 
coach, any of these accomplish­
ments would be something to brag 
about, and they could be used to 
move one on to bigger things. 
However, none of them have 
changed his outlook on life, ex­
cept, maybe, to strengthen his 
love of coaching cross-country and 
track and field. He admits he 
doesn’t know what else he’d rather 
do for a living. “I love what I’m 
doing,” says Meckley of his 20- 
year career as head cross-coun­
try/ track coach at CMU. That is 
the only inspiration that he needs.
Meckley has needed the inspi­
ration lately. He has had an ill­
ness that renders him very sus­
ceptible to other afflictions the 
past few years and is not sure how 
much longer he can continue to 
coach. “Sometimes I feel like I can 
work another four or five years 
easy. Then there are other times, 
like today, when I wonder how 
I’m going to make it through the 
rest of the week.”
But he doesn’t let it get the best 
of him, he just takes extra pre­
cautions to bundle up on days 
when it’s even slightly chilly out. 
You can find him at practice in 
the early spring wearing his over­
sized parka, barking out the or­
ders that everyone will follow 
without complaint.Meckley won’t 
let his illness drag him down, 
because he is not looking forward 
to retirement. “My goal in life is to 
work for as long as I possibly can. 
When I’m feeling well, I’d like to 
work until I’m 70. This is what 
keeps me going.”
What causes a man like Gary 
Meckley to become infatuated 
with a sport? Meckley credits a 
boyhood hometown hero. When 
Meckley was twelve years old, a 
boy from his small hometown went 
to Penn State, and proceeded to 
become one of the top three one- 
milers in the nation. “He ran a 
4:01.7 mile before anyone ever 
broke 4:00.00,” Meckley says 
proudly. Even though Meckley 
excelled at other sports (he was 
an honorable mention all-state 
football player) he channelled his 
efforts into track and field be­
cause of this hometown hero. “I
really loved track because ofj 
influence of this person.” 
Young Gary Meckley foundl 
he had tailent for the pole vaul 
fact, he was good enough to 
state champion and state rea 
holder in the event. He contin 
his career at the University 
Pittsburgh, where he held 
school pole vault record for s< 
time. During his sophomore 
he had a tough blow; he inji 
his achilles tendon. Competi 
became impossible. Med1 
looked at his career as a dis 
pointment. “I did not get a cha 
to fulfill my potential. I am do 
that now, by coaching.”
He became head coach at 0 
after a short career as assist 
coach at Pitt. “They gave 
job because I was a young 
and it wouldn’t cost them 
much.” Little did CMU rea 
what kind of bargain it woul1 
getting. He became one t 
most winning coaches in W

Meckley expects dedicated athletes
continued from page 14
history. Win. Lose. What does 
each really mean to a man with a 
record like Meckley’s? He’s been 
known to yell at his cross-coun­
try team after they swept two or 
three teams. On the other hand, 
he’s told his teams that they put 
forth a great effort after falling 
just short of victory. He just wants 
everybody to put forth the best 
effort. “If you do the best you can, 
you’re not a loser,” Meckley tells 
his athletes. That’s why he is a 
winner; he gives his all, and ex­
pects his teams to do the same.
He doesn’t just expect his ath­
letes to be their best, he gets them 
to be their best. Meckley gets these 
results because his runners re­
spect him on both a professional 
and a personal level. As a coach, 
he expects his athletes to dedi­
cate themselves to the sport if 
they are to be their best. His life­
long dedication to the sport is a 
perfect example for them to fol­
low. He knows when his athletes 
aren’t performing to their fullest, 
and he lets them know. He doesn’t 
have to tell them face to. face, but 
he will if he finds it necessary. 
Instead, he can get his point across 
with a cold stare that can cut 
right into a person, and bring 
back out a drive to be the best.
His desire to have a team full of 
athletes that are dedicated to 
track and field could be his down­
fall, as well as one of his greatest 
strengths. He uses an old meta­
phor to explain the difference 
between dedicated to and involved 
with his team, “When you look at 
ham and eggs for breakfast, you 
see that the eggs are involved, but 
the ham is dedicated.”
Even though standing by your 
principles is a very admirable trait 
in a person, it can lead one into a 
great deal of trouble. In Meck­
ley’s case it has lost him a great 
deal of potentially fantastic ath­
letes that just don’t have the time 
or desire to compete the way that 
Meckley wants. In the long run he 
ends up with a very dedicated, 
talented team, but it is also a 
team lacking in depth.
“If you do the best you can, you're 
not a loser. ”
* Head Coach Gary Meckley
Life at Carnegie Mellon for 
Meckley was not always one in 
the winning tradition. He found 
the track program a shambles, 
with the team’s record from the 
year before containing ten losses 
by more than 100 points. The 
cross-country team was at best 
adequate, but as Meckley says, 
“for a good coach, adequate is not 
nearly good enough.” The cross­
country team had a 5-5 record his 
first year here. He recalls the 
headlines from Focus, a CMU 
magazine:M ‘Gary Meckley’s team 
goes to worst record in a decade.’ 
Ever since then I said, they’d never 
have the chance to say that about 
one of my teams again.”
He was right, they didn’t. His 
dual meet record in cross-country 
has remained unblemished for 
over 90 meets, destroying the old 
NCAA record of 66 straight victo­
ries. He takes it all in stride, and 
just worries about winning the 
next one. He claims that even the 
day that he broke the record, he 
never mentioned it to his runners 
as the reason they had to win. ‘I 
don’t know or care what other 
coaches are doing with their 
teams,” Meckley says about com­
paring himself to others. That 
doesn’t matter to him as long as 
he continues to be the same coach 
he has always been. “Every year I 
evaluate myself and say ‘Am I the 
coach that I want to be?’ I feel that 
if I’ve been the coach that I want 
to be, then everything’s gonna be 
all right.”
With the rising costs and higher 
academic standards at CMU, it 
has become increasingly difficult 
for him to recruit new athletes. 
He admits that he has thought 
that giving out scholarships, 
something that Division III teams 
cannot do, would be nice, but he 
feels that Division III is true
amateurism. “If you have the 
scholarship money to give out, 
anybody could be a good coach. At 
Division III, anybody can’t be a 
good coach.” His worries aren’t 
about the kids he doesn’t have 
running for him; instead, he con­
centrates on the people he does 
have, and does the best job he can 
with them. “If I do that, and I lose, 
when I look at myself in the mir­
ror, I’m still going to respect my­
self.”
Track is a very individual sport, 
and perhaps that is why Meckley 
prefers cross-country. Meckley 
comments on the difficulty of 
coaching a track team: “When 
there’s only two or three of us 
down there that know anything 
about track, divided by 100 kids, 
there’s not much teaching you can 
do.” There are some people that 
he coached at CMU whom he does 
remember well; All-Americans 
like Mike Short and John Wessels. 
Then there is Ivan Juzang, whom 
Meckley found at an intermural 
track meet. He worked with 
Juzang a lot that year, and J uzang 
made All-American in the long 
jump. He remembers many more 
than the great performers that he 
had. “These are just names that 
stand out. There are a lot of other 
people down through the years. 
Their situation, their name will 
pop into my mind, and I get a good 
feeling from it.”
Meckley admits that luck has 
played a part in getting where he 
is right now, but once you meet 
him, you are convinced that he 
could have done a great job any­
where. It certainly seems strange 
that he hasn’t been swept away 
by some big school with a lot of 
money to offer. Perhaps it has 
just been lucky for Carnegie 
Mellon or, simply, he’s really 
happy right where he is.

Spring Carnival 1989
“There is no pleasure in having nothing to do; the 
fun is in having lots to do and not doing it. ”
—John W. Raper
Do you ever stop and watch the children playing?
Have you ever taken a little time, between work 
and more work, and stopped by the Children’s 
School to watch the children playing?
Everyone should, once in a while. Here in our 
academic steam bath, we often forget how to play.
Do' you ever buy yourself a toy?
Have you ever gone into a store and purchased 
something absolutely silly, something completely 
off the wall, something you’ll never need for your 
classes or your career?
Everyone ought to, every now and then. Here, 
where we have made “The Professional Choice,” we 
often forget what a toy is.
This past weekend, the campus had a very special 
opportunity. We were told that we could take some 
time to play. We discovered that maybe, just maybe, 
we might dust off the old toy chest and reintroduce 
ourselves to some old friends.
It’s almost a foreign thought, isn’t it? If you sit in 
one place for four months, you won’t be able to 
dance. If you think in one way for four months, you 
won’t be able to play. We have thought in one way 
for far too long, and our minds almost started to 
forget how to dance.
But look around you. Look at the person nearest 
you. Look at their face. Is this person smiling? Is 
this person laughing? Is it possible that something 
may have reminded this person what it’s like to 
have fun?
All the signs said Welcome To Toyland, and eve­
rybody was smiling.
Remember the sensation of speed? The thrill of 
strapping on the new pair of skates and soaring 
down the biggest hill in the neighborhood? Remem­
ber when your big brother (or big sister, sibling 
sadism is non-sexist) took you in your red wagon 
and pulled you as fast as they could run, and you 
were screaming—faster, stop, faster, stop — until 
you couldn’t shout anymore and their legs were 
tired? That’s Buggy; it’s our roller-skates, it's our 
little red wagon.
Remember the feeling of building something? 
Building a sandcastle, soggy and gritty and damp 
and falling as fast as you could pile up the sand? 
Wanting to make the biggest, best, fanciest castle 
on the beach? Remember making a treehouse, a 
clubhouse, a playhouse, and living in it day in and 
day out until Mom finally called you in for supper? 
That’s Booth; it’s our sandcastle, it’s our treehouse.
Do you also remember wanting to have the new­
est roller-skates and the fastest wagon? Wanting 
the biggest sandcastle and the nicest treehouse? 
For that, too, we have our comparisons. For that, 
people on our campus have worked harder and 
slept less than they would for any lab report or final 
paper. For that, there are winners, and losers, and 
“wait ’til next year!”
But look around you. Are people less tense? Is the 
competition in the air just that little bit thinner?
All the signs said Welcome To Toyland, and ev­
eryone was laughing.
And remember those summer nights when the 
most strenuous activity was catching fireflies in a 
jar? Those breezy spring days when the sky would 
fill with colorful diamonds and taut white twine? 
Remember when play was the order of the day, and 
toys were the tools of the trade?
Isn’t it just a little easier to remember?
This weekend we had a Midway of fun, a Tent of 
enjoyment, a race of champions, and the biggest 
clubhouse festival in the world. On Sunday, as the 
sun shone and the breezes blew, we had a concert, 
and the band sang“Life couldbe lovely—Life could 
be so great.”
And look around you. Weren’t they right?

on the Fisher Price Garage. Onlookers remarked that 
every detail was In line with the toy, even down to the 
color of the rope on the gas pump and the unusual shades 
of paint on several of the pieces.

The Midway was a stunning sight at night. The bright 
lights were enough to enchant young and old Carnival 
participants. Many students feared that the rides, a 
Carnival tradition, would disappear with the new campus 
construction, but the Carnival committee came through.

Delta Tau Delta (DTD)
® Fisher Price Garage 
The Game:
•i Players had to roll an actual 
j? Fisher Price car along with driver 
down a ramp on the second level 
'' of the boot through one of two toll 
booths, which were modeled to 
look like enterances to a parking 
garage. As the DTD Booth Chair- 
; man explained, Fisher Price cars 
do not roll in a straight line; the 
challenge is to beat the error fac­
tor and get the car through one of 
E the gates.
The Booth:
The Fisher Price Garage was 
meticulously reproduced. Every 
detail was exact, from the eleva­
tor to the markings on the ground 
floor to the color of the gas hose.

Total points: 1051
Phi Kappa Theta (Phi Kaps)
Clue
The Game:
A player received a Clue card 
with a victim, a weapon and a 
room inscribed on it. A rotating 
wheel with different colored pock­
ets represented the victims. As 
the wheel spun, each victim 
passed through every room. The 
player had to throw the ball into 
the correct pocket while the vic­
tim was in the correct room. Then 
the ball dropped onto a pegboard 
where the ball had to roll into the 
correct weapon slot.
The Booth:
This was the largest booth on 
the Midway, with two stories and 
a balcony. The game was located 
upstairs.
Second in Fraternity division 
Total points: 1049
Pioneers
Fire Truck 
The Game:
A paper model of flames hung 
suspended in front of the flaming 
building. The player had to help 
the fire company extinguish the 
flames by shooting them with a 
dart gun, thereby moving them 
up the building. If the flames were 
hit three times, the fireman 
reached the fire and it was put 
out.
The Booth:
Pioneers’ cheery brightly-col- 
ored booth was shaped like a fire- 
truck; the wheels revolved as if 
the booth was in motion and a red 
emergency light flashed on the 
roof.
First in Independent division 
Total points: 1009
Delta Upsilon (DU)
Monopoly 
The Game:
The object was to throw a ball 
into one of several different col­
ored pockets on a revolvingboard, 
each of which corresponded to the 
different pieces of property on the 
Monopoly board. The brothers 
then rewarded the player with 
DU money equaling the dollar 
amount of each colored pocket. 
The Booth:
A huge Monopoly board with 
raised characters and three di­
mensional pieces constituted the 
foundation of the Delta Upsilon 
bank. Inside the structure, there 
was the teller’s window and post­
ers that contained interesting 
facts about the game Monopoly 
and its history.

Sigma Tau Gamma (Sig Tau)
Simon 
The Game:
Sig Tau received the chips for 
the Simon game and they created 
their own larger version where 
people could actually step on the 
colored tiles rathering than press­
ing them with their hands.
The Booth:
The interior of the booth was 
illuminated by black light. Flures- 
cent paint was used inside for a 
dramatic effect.The booth was a 
geodesic dome. For the dome to 
support itself, all of the measure­
ments had to be correct within 1/ 
32 of an inch.

Fringe
Lego Land 
The Game:
Players faced the challenge of 
catapulting Lego pieces into a 
Lego castle. For only twenty-five 
cents, each player received three 
Lego pieces with which to shoot at 
the structure.
The Booth:
The hard part of building the 
booth was the construction of the 
large Lego blocks. All of the pieces 
used in the booth were actual 
Lego blocks that could be fit to­
gether in numerous ways. The 
booth was constructed to look like 
a large castle much like the one 
into which players had to cata­
pult the Lego pieces.

Chi Omega (Chi O)
Jack-in-the-Box 
The Game:
Participants had to rescue “Jack” 
by throwing balls into holes in a 
board, then onto a spinning circle 
that had different wooden blocks 
on it. The ball would roll around 
and then fall into one of the chutes. 
The ball would roll down the 
chute, which ended in a jack-in- 
the-box. Once the ball hit the box, 
it would pop open and Jack would 
leap out.
The Booth:
The sides of the booth featured 
detailed paintings of a merry-go- 
round horse and a teddy bear. 
The side with the teddy bear also 
housed the crank of the box. In­
side the booth were paintings of 
the moon and a seal balancing a 
ball on its nose.

Candyland 
The Game:
Players attempted to throw 
balls at a gingerbread man while 
he waved his arms back and forth. 
The balls were covered with vel­
cro, while the gingerbread man’s 
hands were covered with cloth. 
The Booth:
Huge lollypops, gumdrops, and 
ice cream cones were a few of the 
decorations in Candyland. A sky­
light in the booth provided for 
natural lighting in the day. The 
path leading to the booth was a 
replica of the path to Candyland.

Kappa Kappa Gamma (Kappa)
Barrel of Monkeys 
The Game:
The players needed to link the 
monkeys, as in the traditional 
game, however, participants faced 
a five second time limit placed on 
each linkage.
The Booth:
Inside the huge barrel was a 
working waterfall, live vegetation,
plastic animals, and jungle noises. 
In a unique twist for Carnival one 
of the sisters wore a monkey suit 
and stood outside of the booth 
attracting players during most of 
the weekend.

Kappa Delta Rho (KDR)
Hot Wheels 
The Game:
The first game consisted of 
sending a car down a chute where 
it would launch off of a ramp and 
into a box. If the car landed in the 
box, then the player won. The 
second game was similar to 
Skeeball.
The Booth:
While the players played either 
of two games, a homemade race 
was broadcast. Prizes included 
different sets and types of cars. 
Sitting out in front of the KDR 
booth was a wooden racing car.

to toss beanbags into holes that 
caused Mr. Potatohead’s blank 
features to pop into place.
The Booth:
At nineteen feet, SDC had the 
largest independent booth in the 
competition. The inside was deco­
rated with potato sacks. A garden 
path complete with dirt and stones 
led up to the famous spud. Booth 
attendents wore overalls and

styrofoam cup. There were two 
time limits with different levels 
of prizes to correspond to two 
levels of skill.
The Booth:
The top section of the booth had 
a thin fiberglass roof, so that it 
would glow at night. Unfortu­
nately, the booth was located right 
next to one of the huge lights that 
illuminate Carnival at night and 
the effect was hardly visible.

“The Spirit of Carnival is to have 
ablast, not to spend thousands of 
dollars.”

Square.
The Booth:
In the booth was an issue of the 
Pravda that contained instruc­
tions on how to play the game. 
This was KGB’s first year build­
ing a booth. Their buggy, made 
out of Legos, was on display at the 
booth. “Now if we could only find

Operation 
The Game:
The player would enter the 
hospital and spin for a body part, 
then remove the part from Mr. 
Smith. If the operator were not 
careful enough, a buzzer would go 
off and the game was lost. If the 
body part were removed, then the 
operator would receive either a 
surgical mask or a set of rubber 
gloves.
The Booth:
A piece of painted plywood was 
placed outside where people could 
poke their heads through and

Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles 
with taped projectiles from a sling­
shot-like device as they popped 
up into view. Players had five 
tries to hit the figures.
The Booth:
The booth was set up to look 
like a sewer system as a tie-in to 
the cartoon and comic book. Car­
nival goers could also have their 
picture taken as a Teenage Mu­
tant Ninja Turtle in a specially 
painted backdrop in front of the
booth.

mote controlled car through a race 
course. If the car reached the fin­
ish line before the minute and a 
half was up, the player won his/ 
her choice of the cars that were on 
display.
The Booth:
The racetrack had obstacles on 
it such as bridges, ramps, and 
railings where the car could eas­
ily become stuck. If the car did 
become stuck, then the booth 
attendant would free the car and 
the player could try to reach the 
finish line again. .

bottom of which were several com­
partments marked with domino 
values. The value of the prize de­
pended on the total of all of the

photo by Dan GiurcaSpirit teams take victories in
men s, women s buggy races
By JENNIFER B ANN AN
Tartan Staffwriter
Spirit is the big winner of 
Sweepstakes again this year. The 
women’s team broke the record 
and took first place. The men’s A 
team took first place as well, but 
the record the organization made 
last year still holds. Champagne 
corks popped immediately after 
the races ended.
Sweepstakes ’89 got off to a 
gorgeous start Friday morning. 
Outside of Margaret Morrison, 
organizations had moving vans 
parked with their buggies inside, 
keeping guards at the entrance of 
the van. Spirit has an especially 
formal system of guarding their 
buggies. At the mouth of the van, 
four women or men stand with 
sunglasses and Spirit T-shirts on, 
never moving or cracking a smile.
But all of the organizations 
guard their buggies carefully, and 
with good reason. Buggy races 
are extremely competitive. Or­
ganizations maintain high levels 
of secrecy in the design of their 
buggies so that others cannot copy 
new ideas. An organization’s 
buggy is not set down at the finish 
line until seconds before a heat.
AFROTC is the only exception 
to this rule. In the 1989 “Buggy 
Book” an AFROTC member ex­
plains that the team participates 
in the race to have fun, not to 
compete. Therefore, they do not 
spend the money on a truck to 
hide the buggy in. Anyone can 
look at the buggy, and even con­
template the inner workings, 
because it is completely clear. “A 
drive in a see through buggy is 
the most fun you can have with 
your clothes on,” the team-mem- 
ber writes in the book.
Rumors abound, however. Ask 
any member on any team for a bit 
of gossip and they will tell you 
who heat treats or chemically 
treats their wheels, who uses vinyl 
acetate to clean their ball-bear-
ings, or who does not lubricate 
their ball bearings at all.
The women’s race started out 
with everyone in good spirits. 
WRCT played “psych songs” for 
the different teams, previously 
requested to get the teams into 
the racing mood. When the gun 
was fired for the first heat, the 
excitement ran high.
If a spectator wants to get a 
good view of the entire race, he 
basically has to run back and forth 
constantly. This is apparent from 
the first heat. The gun fires, the 
spectators watch the buggies 
getting pushed up the first two 
hills, and then either try to run 
down to the third and fourth hills 
or run to the finish line. Unfortu­
nately, it is impossible to see the 
buggy run the entire track.
The track consists of five hills, 
the freeroll and the chute. A per­
son pushes the buggy up the first 
hill from the starting line, where 
he or she exchanges with another 
person , who pushes up the sec­
ond hill and then shoves the buggy 
downhill for the freeroll.
During the freeroll the driver is 
by himself or herself. The freeroll 
is a long stretch of the race that 
passes by the monument in the 
middle of the street at the bottom 
of Flagstaff Hill. Jennifer Hurd, a 
buggy driver for SDC, says that 
the freeroll is the best part of the 
race. The chute is a sharp curve 
where the road flattens out at the 
bottom of the hill. The buggy may 
be going up to 40 mph at this 
point. Hay bales line the sides of 
the road to protect the buggies 
and drivers in case they should 
lose control.
On Friday, Phi Kap’s buggy, 
Tempest, spun out (lost control) 
on the chute, as well as Fringe’s 
buggy Tigger, and several others. 
SDC’s buggy Fury spun out in 
both the women’s and men’s races, 
surprisingly after being pushed 
from the second hill. The buggy 
ran into some spectators in the
men’s race, but no one was hurt.
After the chute the road starts 
on an incline, and the pusher for 
the third hill takes over. “It’s not 
as fun when the pushers pick you 
up because you’re not in control 
any more,” says Hurd. “Each 
pusher has their own kind of 
character; you can tell, after 
awhile, who it is. There’s this one 
guy who pushes really crooked, 
and you know whenever he’s 
pushing that the driver is think­
ing, ‘Great! Can’t he push 
straight?’ Meanwhile, the pusher 
is probably thinking, ‘God, can’t 
she drive straight?”’
A buggy’s performance on the 
freeroll is measured by the num­
ber of Porter Hall windows it 
passes. There are ten windows, 
and until last year, they were 
adequate for measuring the 
buggy’s success. DU built a two- 
wheel buggy that passed the ten 
windows and provided a new unit 
of measurement: the fire plug.
The buggy spun out, however, 
and was unfortunately banned 
from the races. The DU brothers 
are not happy with the ban, of 
course, and wear T-shirts pro­
testing it. The shirts depict three 
fluorescent pink breasts on the 
front and have a message on the 
back saying “Forced Evolution— 
Darwin wouldn’t understand ei­
ther.”
Victor Banko, a Mechanical 
Engineering major and DU 
brother, seems optimistic about 
the future of two-wheel 
buggies.“There’s nowhere to go 
with three-wheelers, you can 
improve them a little more. But, 
the two-wheeler is such a jump 
over three-wheelers.” About last 
year’s accident Banko says, “We 
had an accident on race day, but 
in two and a half years we only 
had two accidents. The reason 
they banned two-wheelers is be­
cause they fall over when stand­
ing still. But that doesn’t make

sense because abuggy is never 
standing still.” le thinks that 
eventually the bn will be lifted.
Once past the ùndows and fire 
plug, the pushe for hill three 
passes the buggto the Hill four 
pusher. The Hillive pusher gives 
the buggy the lat good pushes of 
the heat, using he “bump” tech­
nique most oftei This technique 
involves shovin¡the buggy ahead 
and running ti catch up to it. 
Bumping can be detrimental 
when the pushff cannot catch up 
to the buggy.Tiis is because the 
team will be ¿qualified from the 
heat if the puher does not have 
his hand on he push-bar when 
crossing the inish line. Several 
buggies this ¡ear were disquali­
fied both on peliminary and final 
race days fonhis reason.
Immediate? after the heat is 
finished the juggies are pushed 
over to the sifwalk in front of the 
gym for the Irop test. The side­
walk is on a (ill. The buggy is let 
to roll free fr thirty feet from a 
starting lin^fhe driver must then 
be able to top the buggy com­
pletely within thirty feet, then 
release thereaks and stop again. 
If the buggs breaks prove faulty 
in this testthe buggy is disquali­
fied. Beta’earn A and DU were 
disqualifiei for failed drop tests 
on Friday.
One of ne most interesting 
heats on Ffday included SAE’s 
Limo and Ham’s Miss Bud. Miss 
Bud is paired like the wrapper 
on a Budwiser beer bottle, has 
an elaborathorn, and the push­
ers for the Uggy take their time 
'n the heal SAE performed a 
Parody on te police brutality at 
fee GratefuDead concert.
The pushrs were dressed in 
tie-die T-shis, shorts and ban­
danas, leisuily pushing Limo up
the hills and waving at specta­
tors. “Truckin’” poured out of the 
speakers of Limo’s radio. Broth­
ers dressed in police costumes pro­
ceeded to attack the laid-back 
would-be deadheads with plastic 
billy clubs.
After the women’s races on 
Friday, the GM Sunracer was 
driven around the track. The 
Sunracerisa revolutionary solar- 
powered car that actually looks 
more like a buggy than a car. The 
car raced around the track in one 
minute and twenty-nine seconds. 
It reached a speed of about 58 
mph going past the monument on 
the freeroll section of the track: 
perhaps an aspiration for buggy 
mechanics.
But the definite stars of Friday 
and Saturday were the Spirit 
teams. After Heat 14 on Friday, a 
particularly exciting race between 
Spirit, Fringe and Kappa Sigma, 
a WRCT D J waxed poetic: “It was 
just a sea of yellow and gold 
shorts.”
Coming in third in the Women’s 
final races was Fringe Team A. 
Pika took second place with their 
Team A. Spirit Team A set a new 
women’s record of 2:35:651, and 
could not have been happier.
Third in the final men’s races 
was Pika with their Team L? 
Second was Beta with their Team 
A. Spirit Team A was the victori­
ous team again this year with 
their buggy Quantum Leap. They 
were within hundredths of a sec­
ond of last year’s record of 2:06.2.
“Don’t sleep on us,” says Ter­
ence Yard, a Spirit chairman. 
Alluding to Spirit’s statement in 
the buggy book: “This year, many 
of the other teams are putting 
forth exemplary efforts to chal­
lenge us, but then again, three 
seconds is along time,” Yard says, 
“Four seconds is even more."

Action at Blood Bend:
A buggy wipe-out report from the Chute
“Wipe-outs are important because 
wipe-outs are the perverted little 
pleasure that everybody likes. ”
* Austin Meyer
By NICHOLAS WARDIGO 
& CRAIG MRUSEK
Special to The Tartan
The Chute: a foreboding, ninety- 
degree turn, universally accepted 
as the worst bend in the CMU 
buggy race. It has gained a grim 
reputation for being the leading 
cause of buggy wipe-outs as driv­
ers try to maneuver their 5-1/2 
foot long vehicles around the bend 
at speeds approaching 45 miles 
per hour. We decided that it was 
probably the best place to watch.
Our team, made up of myself, 
Craig Mrusek, and a third party 
who prefers to remain anony­
mous, acquired a desirable posi­
tion along the outer curve of the 
Chute at about 8:45 am on Fri­
day. We had brought chairs, ba­
gels, soda, coffee, and a portable 
stereo that perpetually played 
songs by Guns ’n Roses, Scorpi­
ons, and Metallica. We had named 
ourselves “The Vultures.” We 
were comfortable. We became 
wipe-out watchers.
Interviews with random mem- 
-bers of the crowd revealed that 
we were not alone in this sport. 
Fifth-year architecture student 
Esther Rosenblatt, when asked 
why she had chosen that particu­
lar spot to watch the race, replied 
“It’s fun to see if they make it 
through the Chute.”
Fred Mueller, a father of a CMU 
student, responded “The excite­
ment of speed and potential for 
activity and emergency.”
An anonymous alumnus said, 
If you want to get rid of a piece of 
tire, this is the place.”
A second alumnus answered, “I 
followed the skid marks to here.” 
Senior Rob Malan pointed out,
“Experience shows the best ac­
tion’s here.”
Freshman Anna Lesko was a 
little more blatant, “We want to 
see them spin out.” Referring to a 
camera held by her friend, sopho­
more “Ducky” Kahn, she added, 
“We want to have records of this.”
Freshman Brian Noel was 
equally direct, “We want to see 
them wipe-out ... they’re right 
here.”
Freshman Austin Meyer was 
spotted at the Chute with a video 
camera. When questioned, he said 
that he was filming a video for a 
song and wanted footage with 
buggies. When asked specifically 
about wipe-outs, he answered, 
“Wipe-outs are important because 
wipe-outs are the perverted little 
pleasure that everybody likes.”
All of this may seem cold, but 
the chance of injury is small. In 
addition to wearing safety gear, 
drivers are strapped inside of the 
buggies, and the tops of the ve­
hicles are bolted down. Just in 
case, ambulances stand by, a truck 
follows the racers, and people 
trained to help are littered 
throughout the crowd. Hay bales 
line the dangerous curves, and 
drivers are required to walk the 
course before they race.
In the spirit of sport, and with­
out bloodthirsty malice as the 
desire to see injury was non-pres­
ent, my comrades and I rated the
top three most interesting buggy 
wipe-outs at the Chute. It is 
important to note that no actual 
injuries occurred at the Chute.
Third best was Fringe-B’s 
“tygr.” As the tiger-striped buggy 
came around the Chute, a rear 
tire blew out, causing the buggy 
to spin into a complete 180 degree 
turn. As the buggy leaned into the 
Chute, it seemed as though the 
rim of the wheel dug into the tire, 
the apparent cause of the blow­
out and the loss of the wheel it­
self.
Second best was Pika-C’s 
“Thunder.” The buggy had taken 
the turn too wide, and scraped 
against the bales immediately in 
front of us. A wheel was stripped 
off in the process, and the buggy 
scraped the bales for about 
twenty-five feet before stopping.
The best Chute wipe-out, how­
ever, was unanimously picked as 
Pi-Lam’s “Legend.” Just after 
completing the turn, a piece of the 
buggy flew off, the buggy spun 
into a complete 180, and the car 
went into a bale backwards. The 
piece of buggy, no larger than two 
square inches, was unidentified.
Unfortunately, injury did occur 
to watchers in an unseen accident 
by SDC’s “Fury” on Hill Two. In 
addition, several pushers sus­
tained abrasions. The best is, of 
course, hoped for, even by Vul­
tures.

i&J Carnies are people too
photo by Joey Lynn Monaco
These three Carnies take time off from setting up a ride late last 
Wednesday. They are standing In front of the Indiana Jones ride which 
was parked next to Warner Hall.
By JOEY LYNN MONACO
Tartan Features Editor
J&J Amusement supplies the 
rides to Carnegie Mellon’s Spring 
Carnival every year. Since the 
beginning of the week, the 
“Carnies” (J&J employees) have 
been busy getting ready for the 
big weekend.
During the hectic carnival sea­
son, the company travels between 
Pennsylvania, New York, and 
Ohio. The Carnies agree that most 
spots are pretty much the same; 
usually it is the bad times that 
stick out best, like putting up and 
taking down the rides in several 
inches of snow. They generally 
like their Carnegie Mellon time, 
however, because of the lively 
crowds that Spring Carnival 
draws every year.
In the eyes of these carnival ex­
perts, children make the job espe­
cially worthwhile. Children ac­
cept the magic of a carnival, but 
their parents often interfere. Par­
ents leave screaming children on 
rides and insist that they “be 
brave” or shout instructions from 
outside the ride that just confuse 
the children and make them cry. 
And they’re openly suspicious of 
or even hostile toward the ride op­
erators.
The Carnies resent the image 
that many Carnival-goers have of
them. “We’re normal people,” said 
worker Pat Carson, who emi­
grated from Scotland to find some 
work and even found her fiancee 
within the Carnie group.
The crew is more like a family, 
and no one knows that better than 
Sherrie Armstrong, who was born 
into a Carnie family and has trav­
elled with them since she was 
about three. You could also ask 
“Papa Smurf,” the foreman of the 
group, who has been with J&J for 
over thirty years. One of the work­
ers laughingly said that “Papa”
was responsible for keeping them 
all out of trouble, but “Papa” 
wasn’t laughing. However hard 
the job might get sometimes, 
though, he enjoys the work. “How 
can you be here for thirty years 
and not like it?” he asks.
Now that the rides are down 
and Carnival is over for another 
year, the Carnies will travel to 
other carnivals until winter, when 
they will separate and go to win­
ter jobs. They will return to the 
circuit next year, and every year 
thereafter.

Carnival on the Cut
By LAURIE SCHNEIDER
Tartan Staffwriter
There were 16 booths and one 
person sitting on the grass selling 
various things at the Arts & Crafts 
Fair on Friday. The array of 
merchandise on hand ran from 
dog-tags printed with your mes­
sage (name, etc.) to crochet and 
needlework items to tie-dye to 
jewelry. Art students had also set 
up a booth selling shirts, sweats, 
hats, and other things with the 
CMU logo. The Ultimate team 
was selling frisbees, and Eta 
Kappa Nu was selling “Late Night 
at CMU” shirts. Most of the jew­
elry was termed as “art-wear” or 
“wearable art.” This includes 
glass-blown jewelry, barrettes 
made from dominos, pins that 
looked like circuits, etc. There was 
also more traditional jewelry.
An instructor from the Penn­
sylvania School for Culinary Arts 
came to tell and to show the crowd 
how to sculpt ice from a a 300 lb. 
block of ice. First, the ice had to 
warm up a little. The man donned 
rubber coveralls, boots, and an
apron so that he wouldn’t get 
soaked when he started cutting 
the ice. The next step was to sketch 
the outline of the figure he was 
going to carve. Then he began 
sculpting by cutting the block of 
ice with a chainsaw. He had to 
stop to let the chainsaw cool, so 
that the ice wouldn’t crack. The 
finished sculpture was a rocking 
horse — the Carnival logo.
The Navy ROTC’s trick drill 
team also performed on the Cut 
at 3:30 on Friday afternoon. Us­
ing eight rifles and one sword, 
they performed many maneuvers 
which included flipping (spinning) 
the rifles in the air and different 
ways of exchanging the rifles. This 
is the trick drill team’s first year.
A booth was set up on the Mid­
way that made free souvenir photo 
buttons. The operator used a video 
camera to take pictures, and then 
“punched” them onto buttons.
“We were very pleased with the 
attendance at all of the events. 
Many more people enjoyed them 
than we had expected. That made 
it all worthwhile,” said Special 
Events Chair Russ Seligman.

Carnival awards given out on the Cut

Music and laser show rocks gym
By KIRK YENERALL
Tartan Staffwriter
Late Friday night, Carnegie 
Mellon students and guests 
were treated to an extrava­
ganza of sight and sound in the 
main gymnasium. Multi-col­
ored beams of lights flashed 
through the air and geometric 
objects danced on the wide 
screen at the front of the gym­
nasium, while rock music re­
verberated.
The crows anxiously filed 
into a haze-filled gymnasium 
equipped with three large 
screens, more than thirty re­
flective mirrors, a powerful 
sound system, and argon and 
krypton lasers.
Humorous animation on the 
main screen at the front of the 
gym, fascinatingimages drawn 
seemingly “in the sky” in front 
of the two elevated screens, 
and several colors of dazzling 
light that whizzed over the 
heads of the spectators all 
combined to enhance the vis­
ual effects of the show. Some of 
the highlights of the laser show 
were the guitar-playing devil 
that danced around the screen 
during INXS’ “The Devil In­
side,” the shapely woman that 
saunteredfamiliarly on the screen 
during Robert Palmer’s “Simply 
Irresistible,” and - certainly the 
crowd favorite: the entire collec­
tion of snakes, sphinxes, mum­
mies, and ancient Egyptian dei­
ties that strutted their stuff and 
strummed their ankh-guitars to 
the tune of the Bangles’ “Walk 
like an Egyptian.”
Perhaps the most amazing of 
the visual effects, though, were 
those images that seemed to be 
traced in mid-air in front of the 
two elevated screens. The first of 
this type to appear was a group of 
geometric objects that was drawn 
during the playing of U2’s “I Still 
Haven’t Found What I’m Looking 
For.” Later, however, the mid-air 
etchings would become even more 
elaborate as a very realistic eagle 
appeared in the sky, flapping his 
wings gracefully in the heights of 
the gymnasium as Mister Mis­
ter’s “Broken Wings” played in 
the background.
The visual effects comple­
mented the music nicely. For 
instance, during the playing of 
“Burning Down the House” by the 
Talking Heads, graphics reminis­
cent of windows appeared on the 
wide screen. Also, during two
quieter pieces of music of the 
New Age genre, the feeling of 
air and water that seemed to be 
conveyed by the music were re­
inforced by images of puddles 
and stars on the screen ahead. 
Another high point of the laser 
show was that the songs that 
were selected represented a 
wide range of musical inter­
ests. Because the performance 
featured artists as varied in 
style as the Beach Boys and 
Bon Jovi, almost something for 
everyone.
In between the longer pieces 
of music and laser artistry, 
humorous shorts from movies 
such as “Back to the Future” 
and “Space Balls” were inserted 
into the show. This tactic helped 
to add variety to the perform­
ance. However, the sound qual­
ity during thesemovieclipswas 
not as good and, during one 
long clip, the show seemed to 
drag due to problems with the 
sound system.
When it was all over, the 
audience seemed to be more 
than satisfied with the overall 
show. In viewofthe laser show’s 
resounding success, it would 
be nice to see it become another 
carnival tradition in the future.
It began at 4:30 pm, Thursday, 
April 13, with the sound of fusion 
jazz from Glen Mauser and Joel 
Reist, while JackKalvin and Rick 
Rubenstein juggled near the 
thrilled crowd of spectators gath­
ered around Midway entrance. 
Thirty minutes later the an­
nouncement finally came as Dave 
Levy, Carnival Chairman, cut the 
purple ribbon, thereby officially 
opening the Spring Carnival ’89 
festivities.
Carnival ended with much the 
same excitement, two days later 
at 10 pm on the Cut. Members of 
AB tossed out cups and frisbees 
bearing the Toyland logo as the 
crowd cheered. Then various 
chairpersons handed out trophies 
for the several competitive events 
of the weekend.
The awards for T-shirt design 
were handed out by Publicity 
Chair Maureen Yin, who an­
nounced a special award for Pi 
Kappa Alpha’s “Batman” design. 
First place for the Booth t-shirt 
went to Delta Upsilon for their 
“Monopoly” design. First place in 
the Buggy t-shirt went to Sigma 
Nu.
After the t-shirt awards, Chair­
person Chris Hansen introduced 
his Buggy committee and thanked 
everyone for making this year’s 
Sweepstakes, his last as an un­
dergraduate, a roaring success. 
Erica Levy, the Buggy Design 
Chair, handed out trophies for 
Buggy design as follows: in third 
place, Fringe with Lunatic; in 
second place, Kappa Delta Rho 
with Paladin, and in' first place, 
Sigma Nu with Pope.
Winners in the Women’s Sweep­
stakes division were: in sixth 
place, CIA with Stealth 2:57.198; 
in fifth place, Pika B with King 
Solomon 2:55.168 in fourth place, 
Spirit B with Tachyon 2:49.474; 
in third place, Fringe A with Bar­
rier 2:45.717 in second place, Pika 
A with Predator 2:36.574; in first 
place, with a new course record, 
Spirit A with Quantum Leap 
2:35.651.
Winners for the Men’s division 
were: in tenth, Sigma Nu with 
Calugo 2:23.957; in ninth, Pika C 
with Thunder 2:19.109; in eighth, 
CIA with Stealth 2:17.416; in 
seventh, Spirit B with Sting 
2:16.766; in sixth, Fringe A with 
Barrier 2:13.767; in fifth, Spirit C 
with Tachyon 2:13.323; in fourth, 
Pika A with Breathless 2:12.652; 
in third, Pika B with Predator 
2:12.082; in second, Beta A with 
Mercury 2:10.239; in first, Spirit 
A with Quantum Leap 2:06.576.
Finally, Midway Chair Pete 
Burger handed out the trophies 
for the Booth competition, giving 
the Chairman’s choice to KGB, 
who shouted: “Not bad for a bunch 
of Geeks!” Trophies in the Inde­
pendent division went to: in third 
place, Student Dormitory Coun­
cil for “Mr. Potato Head” with 897 
points; in second place, Fringe for 
“Lego Land” with 986 points; in 
first place, Pioneers for “Pioneers 
Hook and Ladder” with 1009 
points. Trophies in the Sorority 
division were awarded to: in sec­
ond place, Tri-Delta for “Can- 
dyland” with 922 points.; in first 
place, Chi Omega for “Jack in the 
Box” with 970 points. Fraterni­
ties: in third place, Delta Upsilon 
for “Monopoly” 1006; in second 
place, Phi Kap for “Clue” 1049; in 
first place, Delta Tau Delta for 
“Fisher Price” 1051.
For all division, scores were 
taken outofl200 points total. Six 
judges each awarded up to 200 
points per booth.
Anticipation runs high at the 
awards ceremony, as every 
organization waits, hoping to hear 
its name. The trophies are 
treasured and prominently 
displayed when finally taken back 
to “home base."

Scotch ‘n’ Soda takes a look at the end of the worlc
By DRUE MILLER
Tartan Copy Manager 
& MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
Scotch ‘n’ Soda sparked laugh­
ter and tears in the Skibo Ball­
room this weekend with their 
presentation of This Is Not A Test, 
the club’s original spring produc­
tion.
The show was based around a 
very simple premise, that being 
Armageddon. You know: world 
disaster, the wrath of God, end of 
the world — in short, a gigantic 
meteor that has “Earth or Bust” 
stenciled on its rocky side, in­
bound at millions of miles an hour 
with a 70% chance of knocking 
our little planet straight into the 
sun at exactly 6:23 am EST.
“Oh, that’s clichiid—that’s such 
a silly theme,”you say? Well, think 
again. S ‘n’ S presented the prob­
lems — and the humor — of an 
impending apocalypse with a 
great deal of style and flair. To 
tell the truth, it takes a certain 
amount of chutzpah to write and 
perform a musical about the end 
of the world, and it takes a lot of 
talent and enthusiasm to do it 
successfully. Scotch ‘n’ Soda did 
do it successfully, and kudos are 
due to the director and cast for 
that.
This Is Not A Test strived to 
echo reality at every turn. Of 
course, reality is often far stranger 
than we care to admit. The show 
opened with two large television 
monitors showing an early-morn­
ing press conference with world- 
renowned physicist Doctor Got- 
terdammerendung, who revealed 
the nasty news about the meteor, 
a secret he’d been sitting on for 50 
years (he wanted to wait until the 
last possible minute, so as to not 
cause a panic). What ensued was 
a sampling of scenarios that might 
occur over the following 24 hours 
as people prepared for the me­
teor’s likely, but not definite, 
/arrival.
, The catchy “This Is Not A Test” 
musical number started the stage 
action. With a light but punchy 
score composed by Jessie Ramey 
and performed by Ramey (key­
boards) and Jeff Muller (electric 
guitar), the company sang of their 
confusion, then broke into over 
.two dozen individual skits, ar­
ranged chronologically. A 9 am

the news. A mean-spirited man­
ager spends his morning collect­
ing resignations from embittered 
employees finally brave enough 
to tell him off now that they’ve 
nothing to lose. A door-to-door 
con man, calling himself the Angel 
of Death and looking suspiciously 
like FBI, tries to sell an old woman 
guaranteed salvation — for cash 
up front. Two long-feuding sis­
ters break into battle over the 
dinner table — and over one sis­
ter’s husband, who wonders aloud 
if he married the wrong sibling. 
Yes, it does take impending doom 
to bring out the best in people.
The S ‘n’ S cast put in strong, 
often superb, performances. The 
difficulty of much of the material 
weakened the show in parts, but 
it was by and large consistent. 
Veteran S'n’S director Tamar 
Copeland kept the cast focused on 
their respective roles, and the 
resulting choppiness that came 
from combining so many differ­
ent perspectives was surprisingly 
effective at reinforcing the show’s 
believability.
Outstanding performances 
were put in by Javier Grillo- 
Marxuach, as an uptight execu­
tive, a hen-pecked husband, and 
a cruel-hearted drug store clerk; 
Jessica Bier, as a venomous office 
worker; and Christopher Hirt, as 
the boy-next-door in the show’s 
biggest running gag, “The Con­
dom.” Richard, emphatically re­
ferred to as “Dick” by everyone 
else (yes, you are supposed to 
interpret it that way) decides to 
spend his final night with a cer­
tain young lady (played by Kym 
Helbig) in a certain secluded spot 
performing a certain carnal act. 
Amazingly enough, she agrees to 
it, so long as he “has protection,” 
which of course he doesn’t. Need­
less to say, Richard is off and 
running. A few skits later, he 
arrives at the friendly neighbor­
hood convenience store, only to be 
harassed, abused, and embar­
rassed in every manner possible 
by a sadistic clerk (played by 
Federico Hattoum, who also por­
trays Richard’s brother in an 
earlier scene) who finally admits 
that they’re sold out. Richard 
reappears every few scenes at 
different stores and receives 
equally hostile receptions at all of 
them; one clerk finally agrees to 
sell him a box of Spartan Ribbed 
Super Lube Tubes - for $2000. 
Richard’s protests are countered 
by a terse explanation of supply- 
and-demand economics that 
would even make Steven Klepper 
giggle. Of course, in his final 
appearance (“Escape from the 
Condom”), he returns trium­
phantly at 6:03 am, condoms in 
hand (he had to sacrifice his Rolex 
for them), only to find his sweet­
heart - you guessed it - sound 
asleep.
Not all of the scenes were of 
humorous intent, though. Several 
touched on the very serious side 
of total annihilation, among them 
three monologues entitled “Noth­
ing Changes,” “Conservation of 
Matter,” and “Morning Comes 
Early,” performed by Catherine 
McAuliffe, Jonathan Uman, and
Heavy Cats play “farewell show”
By MIKE SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The Heavy Cats, a local band 
made up of CMU students, played 
their cool jazz to an anxious audi­
ence Friday night in the tent. 
Although the show was sched­
uled to begin at 6 pm, the band 
didn’t finish setting up until after 
6:30.
The band is made up of a vary­
ing number of CMU students (for 
this gig, they numbered seven). 
The members of the band are Ino- 
mata, on drums; Josh Joffe, pi­
ano; Doug Ellena, guitar; Joel 
Reist, bass; Jay Cosentino, trom­
bone; Paul Cosentino, tenor sax; 
and Ian Gordon, trumpet.
The band played a number of 
jazz standards. They also played 
a few original pieces, including 
Gordon’s composition “Sack-a- 
Nutz” and Ellena’s piece composed 
in honor of his impending gradu­
ation, “Out-a-here.”
There aren’t too many things 
you can say about jazz bands; 
either they played well and people 
enjoyed the show, or they didn’t 
, play well and people walked out.
When the Heavy Cats played, 
a most of the people walked out.
This really wasn’t very fair to the 
band because all things consid­
ered, it was a really good perform­
ance. Due to their late start, the 
band was only half-way through 
the set at 7 pm and many stu­
dents were seen sneaking out the 
side doors of the tent and 
making their way towards 
the side entrance of Skibo.
Some truly die-hard jazz 
fans waited the full half- 
hour overtime for the band 
to set up and then stayed for 
the entire show. Obviously, 
they enjoyed the show or 
they wouldn’t have stayed 
put so long. In asking some 
of the students who left early 
why they left before the show 
was done, the main reasons 
were, in fact, “I was hungry 
and it was dinnertime,” or 
“The band was really late 
and I was meeting friends 
at 7,” etc, etc, etc.
The performance was 
billed as the “last stop on 
[The Heavy Cats] Farewell 
Tour” because three of the 
original members are gradu­
ating in May. Even with the 
personnel losses, the re­
maining members of the
Michelle Nagy respectively. Of 
special merit were McAuliffe and 
Nagy’s performances; both ac­
tresses were challenged with very 
difficult material (McAuliffe’s 
character was an indigent older 
woman, while Nagy portrayed a 
high school senior with ambitions 
of becoming the next Amy Irving) 
and both certainly lived up to the 
expectations of the script.
Another sequence on the seri­
ous side was the “Arms and the 
Man” two-parter, in which Jim 
O’Connell and Todd VanderHey- 
den played arms negotiators in 
Geneva, one American (O’Con­
nell) and one Soviet (VanderHey- 
den), who take their last opportu­
nity to negotiate their differences 
away. These scenes were excel­
lently written; both O’Connell and 
VanderHeyden were able to show 
the humanity of their situation, 
even through O’Connell’s bitter 
sarcasm and VanderHeyden’s 
indelibly thick Russian accent. 
The high quality of the scripting 
also shone through in the strong 
humor of the scene; at one point, 
O’Connell suggests that the Rus­
sian speed things up before “we 
all buy the collective farm, if you’ll 
pardon the pun.”
On the whole, the entire shi 
was well written, although t 
hands of the eight different see 
authors did make for stylis 
changes from scene to scene t\ 
were occasionally distracting! 
large part of the show was wr

listed in the program as the hea 
coordinating writer; other authi 
included Amanda Cohen, Dan

Tuesday rockedthe Cut

inger Aimes Mann fronted ’Til Tuesday this past 
iinday on the Cut.
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Contributing Editor 
& MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
Til Tuesday capped off Spring Carnival ’89 with 
an outdoor concert which featured songs from their 
latest album, Everything’s Different Now. The 
concert provided the perfect laid-back finish to an 
otherwise hectic Carnival.
Opening for Til Tuesday was Matthew Sweet, an 
acoustic guitarist and A&M recording artist. His 
collaboration with the band doesn’t end with open­
ing for them, as he co-wrote the title track to 
Everything’s Different Now and joined them on 
stage for the performance of the song.
The headline act took the stage at about 3 pm to 
the enthusiastic response of the crowd, estimated 
by Adam Goldsmith of AB at about 1000 people. 
The audience stretched from the stage at the cross­
walk between Skibo and Warner Hall all the way 
past the Carnival Tent to the southwest comer of 
Skibo, with many people sitting on the Skibo ter­
race and standing on the sidewalk.
The quartet’s mostly acoustic songs about rela­
tionships, simple and not so simple, drew the audi­
ence out of the post-Carnival blahs. The weekend’s 
best weather, clear sunny skies and warm breezes,
brought out both fans of the group and sun worship­
pers. Almost everyone seemed to welcome the chance 
for a little R&R, and the band fit right in with their 
folky, non-aggressive style.
Senior Jay Stevens said of the show that “it was 
pretty mellow.” Sophomore Jim O’Connell said, “Its 
a good idea to get a band that’s more 
accessible.. .often, we get groups that are a little too 
arty.” Although the audience was fairly quiet for 
the first two-thirds of the show (what lead singer 
and guitarist Aimee Mann referred to as “the folk 
part”), when Mann and the band kicked in with 
some faster, louder material from their albums, the 
crowd responded, and afew even gotupanddanced.
The band’s act featured the intricate musical 
interplay of Mann and drummer Michael 
Hausmann. Their harmonies propelled the band 
through their newer songs, “Long Gone Buddy” and 
“How Can You Give Up,” and back to their earlier 
work, including their one top-ten hit “Voices Carry,” 
as well as covers of songs from bands from the 
Hoodoo Gurus to They Might Be Giants.
All in all, Til Tuesday provided a suitably relax­
ing ending to the year’s biggest campus-wide party. 
AB Concerts chairman Rob Bethge said, “1 think it 
was a fantastic ending to Carnival...the band was 
great, the weatherwasgreat, and the crowd seemed 
to enjoy it...it was perfect.”

•Scotland Yard strives to pro- 
tde new, unique entertainment, 
nd often it comes from CMU 
Indents. On Saturday night, the 
and Bob Hop (pronounced 
rape”) played the Yard and pro­
ved some great music and some 
itra fun.
The group is led by Jon Schicke- 
>nz, who is also the lead singer 
»d plays rhythm guitar. Ted 
Btorrio plays rhythm guitar, 
irdan Berlaut play s lead guitar, 
leve Shreve is on bass, and JefF 
fr. Excitement” Miller is the 
nimmer.
The group has an interesting 
¡pertoire of cover songs and origi- 
>1 materia] composedbySchicke- 
®z. “We love to play,” said 
fekedanz. About his band he 
“d, “I really love these guys.” 
The group played two hour long 
raws, but it was the second 
lienee that was really alive, 
ice the show began, an audi- 
Ke member yelled out for the 
ynyrd Skynyrd song“Freebird.” 
Aickedanz later confessed that 
ley practiced the song as a joke. 
e sangit in a voice that was sort 
8 cross between Kermit the 
tog and Bob Marley.
This was followed by a sort of 
¦8gae version of Eric Clapton’s 
¦Maine.” The audience was eat- 
6 it up. Then the group kicked 
a little. Schickedanz teamed 
P with Berlant to perform the 
¦jginal tune “Let’s GetTogether.” 
"e audience enjoyed the lilting 
Whms and lyrics of Schicke­
l's compositions, 
fhe two highlights of the show 
toe when Intorrio introduced
his father, who had come in from 
Cleveland to see his son perform. 
Mr. Intorrio then strapped on an 
accordion and the crowd went 
nuts. Schickedanz stepped up to 
the mike and began to sing “I’m in 
the Mood for Love” with Mr. In­
torrio accompanying. In typical 
“lounge lizard" fashion, Schicke­
danz worked the crowd and 
milked the moment.
After the song, Schickedanz 
yelled out, “O.K. everybody, ITS 
POLKA TIME!” Mr. Intorrio 
began playing “Roll Out the Bar­
rel” and several couples began to 
polka around the Scotland Yard 
floor.
The very last song was the other 
highlight of the evening. The 
group, again running the enter­
tainment gambit, played the song 
“BigBottom”from themovie This 
is Spinal Tap. The lyrics shocked 
some audience members, but no 
one got up and left until they had 
heard all of it.
The show’s only weak point was 
not the fault of the band. Unfortu­
nately, most groups have to use 
the Yard’s own PA system as a 
speaker system. Often, the group 
sounded like it was coming over a 
bad AM radio. But the music was 
good and the band showed the 
crowd a very good time.
Cabaret is a hit
By STEPHEN GLICKER
Tartan Staffwriter
Every night this weekend in Scotland Yard, 
there was a band or singer performingforyou to 
listen to while you were snacking. To kick off 
the entertainment during Carnival, Matt Ire­
land, Robin Garber, and Wayne Worley made 
up the Scotland Yard Cabaret on Thursday 
night.
Sophomore Matt Ireland was first up, and he 
performed for a half hour singing and playing 
his folk songs on guitar. I had heard that he was 
really good during the Mr. Fraternity contest 
last semester, but I was slightly disappointed 
when I listened to him.
Although his voice and his playing were ex­
cellent (except for his song Pink Flamingos, 
Iguanas and Tropical Punch), his songs were a 
little too slow and boring for me. Others who 
saw him perform during the Mr. Fraternity 
show expressed the same feelings.
Next up was Senior Robin Garber who woke 
me up with her songs. Garber performed the 
same type of songs as Ireland did, folk guitar. 
She was just as good as Ireland in the singing 
and playing department, but she had a lot more 
spunk and life than Ireland did. She talked 
with the audience a lot, seemed more awake, 
and just happier to be there. Her contact with 
the audience was the key to her success.
After Garber was finished, Ireland and Gar­
ber gottogetherto sing andplay. Ireland seemed 
to be more awake by then and I liked the way 
that they sounded together. Their voices and 
playing complimented each other and I enjoyed 
their selection of songs.
Finally, the Cabaret ended on ahigh note and 
real change of pace as the playing went from 
folk guitar to piano. Sophomore Wayne Worley 
sang and played selections from Elton John, 
Eric Clapton, and (one of my favorites) Howard 
Jones’ “No One is to Blame.” His playing and 
singing were mellow enough to put you in a 
good mood and help you enjoy your food, but not 
so laid back that it put you to sleep.
Originally Mike Shea was supposed to per­
form with Worley, but something came up and 
Worley did all of his performances alone.
All in all, the entertainment that night at the 
Yard was most enjoyable. I only wonder what 
Garber and Worley would have sounded like 
together, because both of their performances 
were excellent.

'The Mentalist” mystified the Tent
ly MIKE SCHWARTZ
'artan Staffwriter
Probably the most exciting of 
he performers in the Tent this 
lamival was Craig Karges. With 
is fascinating show of games of 
he mind on Friday afternoon, 
[he Mentalist” amused and 
mazed the audience with his 
erformance. It i s easy to see why 
larges was nominated for “Cam- 
ius Entertainer ofthe Year,” 
Some of his tricks were easy to 
iplain, and, in fact, he did ex­
lain some of them. He opened 
is act by having five men in the 
lidience place one personal be- 
mging in a red bag, then he tried
0 guess which item came from 
hich man. Sure enough, he got
1 five correct.
He linked three rings together 
in a chain and took them apart 
again unharmed. He had four 
members of the audience create 
an imaginary automobile (a 
$58,179 fire-engine red Morgan 
with license number AK2198) 
then he produced a sheet of paper 
which correctly listed every de­
tail. He recited the serial number 
of a $5 bill — while blindfolded.
For his final trick Craig took 
the check presented to him by 
SDC topay for his show andplaced 
it in an envelope. He also placed 
two sheets of white paper in two 
similar envelopes. A student se­
lected from the audience was 
asked to come on stage and select 
two ofthe envelopes. Kraig burned 
the two envelopes selected by the 
student while explaining to the
audience that although the trick 
had already failedhim three times 
during previous shows, should he 
actually bum his check, the show 
would be free. Oh, well — better 
luck next time, SDC, because “The 
Mentalist” burned the paper and 
happily collected his fee.
When the show was over, a few 
of the students were asked their 
opinion oftheperformance. “Some 
of the tricks were so simple to 
understand that you just kinda 
sat there and said, ‘Oh, come on!’ 
but some of those others just blew 
your mind!” said one rather en­
thusiastic participant. ScottMat- 
thews, a freshman, says, “You’ve 
seen oneguyread people’s minds, 
you’ve only seen one guy read 
people’s minds.” We’ll let Craig 
try to figure that one out.

There’s a guy with a reason to smile
photo by Michael T. Rose
Why is this man smiling?
He’s smiling because he knows that Carnival is 
almost over. What a sourpuss, eh? Not quite. This is 
Josh Lynn of AB Tech, who was responsible for 
coordinating technical support for all the Tent-based 
and AB-sponsored events of Carnival, including all 
the bands, the dances, the laser show in the gym, and 
Carnival’s Opening and Closing Ceremonies.
Lynn’s responsibilites kept him awake about twenty 
hours a day for most of Carnival. Our photographer 
caught him at the Tom Kenny comedy show, where he 
certainly wasn’t the only person smiling.
Tom Kenny plays Tent
By MICHAEL T. ROSE
Tartan Diversions Editor
The Carnival Tent rocked with 
laughter on Saturday night as co­
median Tom Kenny brought his 
madcap brand of stand-up to 
campus.
Kenny came to Carnival under 
the wing of AB Entertainment 
Spotlight, and was introduced by 
the ever-vivacious (and, sadly, 
laryngitis-stricken) Amanda 
Cohen. He took the stage in a 
striking pink button-down and 
his trademark ’50s-style eye­
glasses, to the loud cheering of 
the audience.
The Tent was packed and get­
ting even more crowded as Kenny 
launched into his act, beginning 
with a discussion of growing up. 
Kenny claims that he has one of 
those fathers who think they have 
mechanical aptitude “just because 
they have a penis.”
Kenny brought up a few local 
jokes that he had devised from his 
walk around the Midway. He said 
that if he were to attend Carnegie 
Mellon (which he occasionally 
referred to as “Honeydew Mel­
lon”) andjoin a fraternity, it would 
almost certainly be KGB. “What 
is this,” he asked, “a fraternity for 
people who can’t get into fraterni­
ties? I just said to 
myself, ‘If I had to 
find a peer group 
here, it would defi­
nitely be these 
guys.’”
Kenny also had a 
lot to say about tele­
vision shows, espe­
cially the Wheel of 
Fortune-Jeopardy 
back-to-back lineup.
“This is the only 
hour of television,” 
says Kenny, “that 
can make you feel 
like the world’s 
greatest genius in 
thefirsthalfandthe 
world’s biggest idiot 
in the second half.”
At one point,
Kenny was discuss­
ing his preference 
for USA Today 
(“...all the articles 
are only two lines 
long ... and on the 
next page you have 
a giant full-color 13- 
part pie chart ex­
plaining this 14- 
word article.”) and 
an audience mem­
ber yelled out, “The
Tartan!” Kenny responded with, 
“What? Don’t you like The Tar­
tan? It’s so colorful, though ... it’s 
the campus USA Today.”
Kenny brought up anewspaper 
article that he had read back in 
March which told of the freak 
deaths of three people in Buenos 
Aires caused by a poodle falling 
out of a 13-story window.
One elderly woman was hit by 
the poodle and killed instantly. 
Another woman, who witnessed 
the scene and was standing in the 
street, was struck by a passing 
bus and killed as well. Finally, an 
elderly man who saw the whole 
chain of events was stricken with 
a heart attack and died on the 
way to the hospital.
Although this is a true and 
tragic story, the fact that Kenny 
could make it hysterically funny 
(“It’s probably still going, this 
weird domino effect — anything 
that goes wrong from now until 
the end of the century, you blame 
it on that dog in Buenos Aires!”) 
says a great deal for his comedic 
talent.
Kenny has toured with Bobcat 
Goldthwait and has opened for 
other major comedians. It’s clear 
from his performance here that 
he is headed for bigger things in 
the very near future.
Deadly by Desire smokes Yard
By DAWN BROSONSKI
Tartan Staffwriter
Deadly By Desire really rocked 
Scotland Yard Saturday night. 
The show started forty minutes 
late, but when the sound check 
smokes, you know you’re in for a 
show. Unfortunately, not many 
people were there for the experi­
ence.
The original Deadly By Desire 
was formed about two years ago; 
since then there have been vari­
ous changes in the band person­
nel. Mark Fern, the guitarist and 
lead vocalist, hails from England; 
the rest of the band is from Pitts­
burgh. John Deley, keyboards and 
vocals, is a CMU Music major. 
Rounding out the group are John 
Hall on bass and Ben Cortese on 
drums. Cortese is the only mem­
ber left from the original group.
The group performed all origi­
nal material; including “Hypo­
crite,” “Your Sacrifice,” and “Be­
fore You Go.” For only four musi­
cians, they have a rich sound that 
comes as a surprise. They were 
well received by the audience.
Deadly By Desire suffered from 
two disadvantages. One, they 
were performing at the h our when 
most people were on the Cut for 
the Carnival closing ceremonies.
If they had been scheduled to 
perform at any other time, it would 
have provided the opportunity for 
a much larger audience.
Sharon Rosen, a sophomore 
Drama student, said, “I really 
enjoyed them. I just think they 
deserved a better space for a bet­
ter audience.”
This brings us to the second dis- 
advantage:These guys need room 
to play! The atmosphere of the 
Yard just doesn’t work with their 
upbeat, wake-you-up-and-kick- 
you-around-the-room music. They 
have an energy when they per­
form that could be absolutely 
incredible if they just had the
right forum. This is the type 
group that makes you want to g 
up and dance yourself silly, f 
sorry, but the calmly seatedcroi 
is not what these guys deserv 
Too bad they couldn’t have pe 
formed in the Ballroom, or evi 
in the Tent.
Right now Deadly By Desire 
just playing locally; they plan 
be recording soon at Alpha St 
Studiosin McKeesport. Right ni

SDC sends student to 
NYC at Suitcase dance
By MIKE SCHWARTZ
Tartan Staffwriter
The SDC Suitcase dance, al­
though competing against the 
laser show, managed to draw a 
fairly large crowd to the Tent on 
Friday night. Due to technical 
difficulties, the band followed the 
general trend of late beginnings 
set earlier in the day. Although 
scheduled to begin at 9, the band 
was unable to start their show 
until almost 10 pm.
The band performing was Foxx, 
a group from Beaver County. A 
top-40 band, they concentrated 
on the tunes of Bon Jovi, Journey 
and Guns ‘N’ Roses. Somebody 
really should’ve stopped them 
when they started playing the 
Guns ‘N’ Roses. All in all, though, 
they were a well-received band 
and word has it that SDC is plan­
ning to call on them again for 
future events.
While dancing was the real fun, 
the main purpose of the Suitcase 
dance was to find a winner for the 
trip for two to New York City this 
Friday, April 21. A raffle, open to 
all CMU students, was held to 
select the winner. To enter, the 
students were required to place
their name and extension on the 
back of the entry ticket and drop 
it in the box. The drawing was at 
10 (as scheduled) but the winner 
was not announced until 11.
The winner of the NYC trip was 
Keith Eklund, a sophomore 
MEMS student. He and a friend 
will spend two days in New York 
at the expense of SDC. The trip 
includes airfare, hotel accommo­
dations and tickets to a Broad­
way show, as well as food and 
transportation. Keith was not 
present at the time of the an­
nouncement and was notified by 
phone.
Getting off to a late start was 
not the only problem SDC ran 
into in holding the dance. One 
student was escorted from the 
premises by CMU security be­
cause he refused to keep off the 
stage while the band was per­
forming.
Although the incident did not 
require the band to stop perform­
ing, it did annoy several of the 
students in the audience. (The 
SDC people weren’t all too happy 
about the matter either.) Even 
considering the difficulties, the 
SDC Suitcase dance concluded 
successfully.
Comedian Tom Kenny admonished his mike stand 
in the Tent Saturday night.
