Noted Explorer 
To Speak Today
Ornithologist, amateur artist and 
photographer, skilled rifle shot and 
author—such are the varied titles 
and aptitudes of Dr. Arthur C. 
Twomey, today’s assembly day 
speaker. As Assistant Curator of 
Ornithology at Carnegie Museum, 
this versatile explorer has traversed 
all of North and South America, 
including the Eastern Arctic regions 
of the Laborador Peninsula and 
Hudson Bay, as well as the Mac­
kenzie Delta, in his attempt to ex­
pand the Museum’s collection of 
bird and animal life.
Having been interested in the 
study of birds from the time he took 
his first “expedition” at the age of 
14, from his home in Alberta, Can­
ada, this versatile ornithologist pur­
sued his studies at both the Univer­
sity of Alberta and the University 
of Illinois. Today, applying his first 
hand knowledge, Dr. Twomey is 
teaching physical, political and eco- 
mic geography to Tech’s ASTP men.
Because of his explorations of the 
Arctic and sub-Arctic regions, 
which were just completed last Jan­
uary, he is intimately acquainted 
with Eskimos who are, he says, “the
Dr. Arthur C. Twomey, noted 
Arctic explorer and present member 
oj the faculty, who will speak in 
assembly today on his travels.
finest native peoples I’ve ever met.” 
Though some of the Eskimos en­
countered in his last expedition 
were so civilized as to be college 
graduates, he has lived with others 
who are still so primitive as to eat 
raw seal meat. In describing this 
delicacy, Dr. Twomey says, “Im­
agine a good mouthful of cod liver 
oil.” In keeping with the customs 
of the far northern areas which he

Much Enthusiasm As 
Techites Hold Rally
“For they’re fighting for the glory 
of Carnegie! — this was the spirit 
that prevailed throughout the pep 
rally Friday night. The band was 
bedecked in its kilts and the cheer­
leaders in their red and whites as 
they led the crowd through the tra­
ditional songs and cheers of C.I.T.
The rally was opened with a se­
lection by the Kiltie Band which 
marched up and down the Tech 
Bowl under the leadership of Bob 
Davis. An excellent performance 
of cheer-leading was shown by Jim 
Braden, an R.O.T.C. stationed here, 
who led the .crowd through the “In­
stitute” and cheerleader Jack 
“Pinkie” Miller, helped rouse the 
fighting spirit of the Techites by 
his undiminishing enthusiam. At 
this point, Coach Joe “Muggsy” 
Skladany gave a speech praising the 
work of the undersized Tech team. 
To quote the Coach, “They are a fine 
bunch of boys and I was glad to 
work with them.”
The Kiltie bag-pipers next took
* the attention of the crowd as they 
played “Yankee Doodle Dandy.” 
After this brief session with the bag­
pipers, the band played “Dear Old 
Tech” and marched across the Bowl 
out onto Forbes Street. Nearing the 
Cathedral of “Yearning” (common­
ly known as Pitt), all voices rang 
out in the Carnegie Fight Song. As 
the crowd marched around the Uni­
versity, the cheerleaders climbed 
upon the stone wall and led the 
crowd through a bevy of cheers. The 
Kilties finally led the crowd back 
through Schenley Park and deposit­
ed them in front of the Administra­
tion Building; with a final render­
ing of “Dear Old Tech” the pep 
rally ended.
Girls Needed To Serve 
Army At “Y” Canteen
Girls who are interested in serv­
ing as Junior Hostesses at the “Y” 
Canteen are urged to secure appli­
cation blanks from Mrs. Yon as soon 
as possible. Inasmuch as the Can­
teen is open only on Saturday from 
3:30 p. m. to 12 midnight and on 
Sunday from 9:00 a. m. to 9:30 p. 
m., hostesses work in shifts — on 
Saturday from 3 to 6, and on Sun­
day from 9 to 1, 1 to 6, and 6 to 9:30.
Any girl who is over 18 may ap­
ply and is urged to do so immedi­
ately.
Although the Canteen is sponsor­
ed by the YM & WHA, girls of all 
faiths may be hostesses.

Interfrat Dance 
Is Great Success«The Interfraternity Dance came 
and went . . . and it was a huge 
success. The members of every fra­
ternity on campus, in mufti and uni­
form, and many alumni danced to 
the music of Clyde Knight at the 
Hotel Schenley Ballroom from nine 
until one last Saturday night.
Mr. and Mrs. Kent Schaffer, Dr. 
and Mrs. Austin Wright, Assistant 
Dean and Mrs. Murphy, Professor 
and Mrs. Rosenbach, and Dean Yon 
were present as chaperones, not on­
ly sitting in the lobby, but often 
cutting the rug with the rest of the 
students.
One of the main features of the 
evening was the singing — well, 
some of it was singing — by each 
fraternity of its song. After these 
performances the whole gathering 
started singing “Skibo” and “Fight 
for the Glory of Carnegie.” The 
band then played a very danceable
— and danced-to — fox-trot version 
of the latter. Another impromptu 
attraction was the Bill Carpenter- 
Kenny Welch drum-piano combina­
tion which played some boogie- 
woogie and swing to the huge de­
light of the audience.
William Frew was elected chair­
man of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, and • president of the 
board of trustees of the Carnegie 
Institute last Tuesday to succeed 
the late Colonel Samuel H. Church. 
After serving as chairman of Car­
negie Tech’s Executive Committee 
since 1937, Mr. Frew now fills the 
post his father held until 1914.
Mr. Frew graduated from Yale 
University in 1903, and took his law 
course at the University of Pitts­
burgh until 1905. He then was ap­
pointed assistant district attorney 
for Allegheny County, a post he 
held until he decided to practice 
law privately. In 1917 he entered 
the army and served as a captain in 
the Air Service as Executive Officer 
of Selfridge Field.
As a hobby, Mr. Frew dabbles in 
painting, and even had a few of his 
works in the Associated Art Ex­
hibits. Golf, trout fishing, and game 
bird shooting are his favorite sports, 
and he had ample opportunity to 
practice them in his frequent visits 
to Skibo Castle, Carnegie’s castle 
in Scotland. In Pittsburgh, Mr. 
Frew p!ays_golL at the -Fox -Chapel 
Country Club, which he founded.
Mr. Frew has been actively con­
nected with the Carnegie Institute 
for many years, serving on various 
committees and boards. His interest 
in our school does not stop with 
that. Almost every afternoon Mr. 
Frew, a resident of the Morewood 
Gardens, can be seen on the cut, 
watching the students play touch- 
football and softball. He is well 
acquainted with many students, 
and old-timers will remember Mr. 
Frew’s Scottie, Agatha, who came 
wagging into office or classroom 
day after day, with utter disregard 
for authority and disciplirie.
J. P. Queen Nominees 
To Be Elected Nov. 9
The date has been set according 
to announcements just released. 
Saturday, November 13, will mark 
the evening of Tech’s annual Jun­
ior Prom. The gala informal af­
fair will be held from nine to one 
at the Hotel Schenley.
Johnny Wolfe and Helen Robin­
son, co-chairmen of the Prom, an­
nounce that the admission price will 
be $2.20 per couple.
Following tradition, Co-Publicity 
Chairmen, La Verne Long and Ed 
Uber reveal that Tech will have a 
queen to reign over the prom. On 
Tuesday, November 9, between 
eleven and one, all students will 
have an opportunity to vote for 
three junior girls from any one of 
the colleges on campus, as their 
choices for Prom queen. Polling 
places will be located in Fine Arts, 
Industries and Margaret Morrison. 
Following this, the three top rank­
ing girls will be the nominees to b° 
voted upon at the Schenley Hotel 
the evening of the dance.

“I, Milton White ...”
I, Milton White, or William McBrien, or Walter Krawczyk, or Stairos 
Stavropoulos.
Rich or poor, white or black, Catholic, Protestant, Jew—now, at this 
moment, we are one. Our hands upraised are one hand, our voices 
quietly repeating the oath of induction are one, our hearts pounding 
nervously are one. I, Milton White. This is it, then. The beginning of 
another life, too: fellows in khaki who will become your friends, camp 
life, barrack life, and all those things you have read about, now to be­
come a reality—K. P., furloughs, G. I. clothes, and rations, bugle calls . . . 
“ ... do solemnly swear (or affirm) ...”
Solemnly. Yes, that’s right. Faces really are solemn, even the 
young faces. A few feet away is a kid from across the street. I remem­
ber him when he was in knickers, delivering newspapers after school. 
He’s eighteen now, and he’s standing straight, his hand upraised, his face 
solemn . . . Solemn, but unafraid . . .
“ . . . that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the United States 
of America ...”
The United States of America. That would be Whittier Street, Spring­
field. Our street and our town. And that would be all the other streets 
and towns in America. It’s to them we’re bearing true faith and allegi­
ance; to them and to that flag standing in front of us; to all our mental 
images of the United States; the cotton fields and old homes of the South, 
and quiet, flat farmlands of the middle states, the blue skies and seas of 
the West Coast, the overwhelming peace and isolation and fragrance of 
Cape Cod . . .
“ . . . and that I will serve them honestly and faithfully against all 
their enemies whomsoever ...”
Nazis and Facists and Japs on Whittier Street in Springfield, on our 
street and in our town. That’s what brings the war close, that thought. 
That’s what we’re going to be fighting for: to keep them away from our 
street and our town. After all, this war is personal. We’re fighting it so 
that the kids skipping rope and laughing; so that the family can be to­
gether again, under one roof, and make plans and look ahead . . .
“ . . . and that I will obey the orders of the President of the United 
States and the orders of the officers appointed over me ...”
Greetings, the President wrote, and heVe I am. It hasn’t been so bad 
so far except for that Sergeant who has been bossing us around all day. 
He’s a bum. All Sergeants are bums. Or do I already feel that way just 
because in a moment ...”
“ . . . according to the rules and articles of War.”
There. It’s done. Hands are down. Quite unconsciously shoulders 
are back, and chests are out.
“Men, you are now, all of you, members of the Army of the United 
States.”
Members of the Army of the United States. That includes me, me— 
Private Milton White. Sounds good, doesn’t it ? Private . . . Milton 
. . . White.

Letters To The Editor
Tech ball games and pep rallies 
show up an interesting inconsisten­
cy in our cheering. The Pep Rally 
the other night gave more people 
laringytis than the Pitt game 
dreamed of doing. Even so, it seems 
that only a select few are capable of 
getting anything much over minus 
ten decimals out of the Tech cheer­
ing sections. A1 Minetti always 
manages to get the gang roaring, 
but the very next cheer will be back 
at the same sub-audible level. At 
the Pep Rally the same cheer done 
by “Brain” what’s-his-name got al­
most as poor response. This is no 
reflection on the cheerleaders; they
have everything required from 
strong yells to short skirts, but noth­
ing seems to come of it. No doubt 
there is more incentive to yell your 
lungs out when you think you are 
being daring by doing it on the 
front lawn of the opposing college, 
but the set-up at the game sounded 
like an amplifier with 200% nega­
tive feedback.
It’s a little late to do anything 
about this for the football season, 
but other sports are coming up. If 
enough students would just forget 
that they are stern-faced engineers 
trying to maintain a professional 
reputation and give out, the rest 
would be anxious to follow.
Katherine Pantazi is an interest­
ing person; there is nothing stereo­
typed or run-of-the-mill about her. 
Her ideas and attitudes are original 
and have a vitality because they 
are her own and not someone else’s 
adopted for the impression they 
would make. She is an independent 
sort of person with a healthy dis­
like for rules and regulations, al­
though she concedes they are neces­
sary; she gives a person the impres­
sion that she doesn’t need rules, not 
because she is clever enough not to 
get caught, but because she can 
honestly get along without them.
Katherine, who will graduate in 
December, is a fifth year architect 
with an enormous capacity for 
work. Last semester she was tak­
ing about seventy-six units of work 
and spending twelve hours on Sat­
urday in the drafting room. After 
she went over a list of all the things 
she didn’t want to be, architecture 
was left; so she came to Tech to 
study architecture. She thinks it 
is one of the smartest moves she 
ever made; she is absolutely wild 
about the work. Next to decorat­
ing and design she likes social sci­
ence courses—she took social rela-* 
tions for three years to satisfy this 
penchant and would like to take 
more some time. Her social-mind- 
edness is evident in the fact that al­
most more than anything else in life 
she wants to make people happy by 
showing them how to make them­
selves happy — teach them how to 
build nice homes, decorate them 
well, and how to make and wear 
good clothes. To her, people—all 
kinds of people, even murderers— 
are wonderful if they are not ignor­
ant, intolerant, and narrow-mind- 
ed.
For years she has made her own 
clothes, even the coats and some­
times the hats, but she can’t knit! 
When she gets a house of her own,

Twenty-first Meeting 
October 27, 1943
The meeting was called to order at 
5:20 p.m.
Present: Messrs. Sher, Wolff, Peterson, 
and Marcus; Misses Rial, Pantazi, and 
Bloom.
COMMITTEE REPORTS 
Social

held on Tuesday. November 9, from 11:00 
to 1:00, to select three girls from the 
junior class, to preside over Junior Prom. 
The final election for queen, from these 
three candidates, will be held at the

Mr. Sher moved that the Women’s Dor­
mitory Council budget be accepted.
Motion carried.
Special Committee
Mr. Murphy presented Miss Schadel’s 
report that activities keys may be silver, 
gold, or jeweled. Organizations must 
submit promptly to Miss Schadel their 
lists of members who are eligible for 
keys, as delivery cannot be made for six

TAN circulation and was asked to make 
a study of publication costs to be sub­
mitted to A. C. A. C.
Mr. Sher suggested that the Assembly 
Program Committee might use moving 
pictures of former Tech football games as 
the basis for some assemblies.

Secretary.
besides designing and decorating it, 
she wants to make some of the fur­

maybe try to weave some rugs. This

but she likes to plan things carefully

a hitch. She lives on a budget; in 
fact her budget is a whole set of 
books. When she goes to a movie, 
she looks for technical perfection— 
good photography, lighting, and 
well-built sets; the subject material 
doesn’t interest her too much.
Since she came to Carnegie Tech, 
she has been on Intersorority Coun­
cil for two years, president of the 
Tri Gams this year, vice-president 
of Mortar Board last year, mem­
ber of Tau Sigma Delta, the Civilian 
Defense Council, and this year is 
president of the Arts School Senate 
and Arts representative on ACAC.
Her favorite luxury is good per­
fume; favorite clothes, shoes; favor­
ite food is anything to eat; favorite 
books, historical novels and biog­
raphies; favorite pastime, dancing; 
place, (anywhere with a smooth floor 
and music); favorite art medium, 
water color; favorite men, the 
Simbolis, father and son—especially 
the latter who is coming home next 
week.
Tech War Activity 
Plans Are Publicized
Instead of being a committee in 
name only, the War Activities Com­
mittee has certainly justified itself 
by the concrete plans it has made 
at its first meeting of the semester. 
War will be coordinated with stu­
dent activity. Included among the 
immediate activities are:
Drive to build closer contact be­
tween the students and the army, 
under the leadership of Professor 
Chapman.
Blood drive, under the direction 
of Miss Russell.
Service providing Christmas let­
ters to Carnegie men in service 
overseas, supervised by Dean Yon.
Consumers’ studying class for pro­
fessional people, taught by Miss 
Alexander.
Drive conducted by the Cwens 
to save scrap, silk stockings, and 
mirrors for the Signal Corps.
According to Professor Parisi, one 
of the things we can work on as in­
dividuals is closer friendship be­
tween the army and students.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.

The Midnight Ride: . . . The lack 
of painted slogans for the Pitt-Tech 
game was not because of any fault 
of the loyal Techites. The “Beat 
Pitt” painted on the cut was washed 
out by the morning rain, and the 
“Yeah — Tech; Beat Pitt; C. L T.”

This week’s column is devoted 
entirely to the printing department, 
who have lost perhaps more stu­
dents than any other department, 
comparatively speaking. Since its 
founding, the Printing Department 
has graduated about 450, and from 
that number 150 are serving in the 
armed forces.
Dan Ossmon left in June, 1943, to 
serve program at Yale. By spec­
ial arrangement with Yale, how­
ever, the printing work that he had 
done here was continued at New 
Haven with the Yale University 
Press.
Gordon Durr, ’29, is serving as 
a captain in the army. At the be­
ginning of the war he was com­
missioned and made assistant opera­
tions officer of the map reproduc­
tion service in Washington, D. C., 
and has been transferred to take 
charge of this service at San An­
tonio, Texas. The record of Lt. W. 
Edelbut, ’34, is a parallel to this ac­
complishment.
Bob Newberger, ’40, recently 
completed basic training at Fort 
Belvoir and proceeded to O. C. S. 
there. He was commissioned in Oc­
tober and assigned to the 37th En­
gineer Reg’t., Camp Beale, Califor­
nia.
From 1939 to 1940 the printing 
department had enrolled in its 
course a lad from Capetown, South 
Africa, Ian Cunningham. In 1940 he 
joined the RAF. He was in London 
during the heavy German raids and 
is still serving with the RAF.
Joseph E. Barnes, ’39, entered 
the service the year of his gradua­
tion attached to a medical admin­
istration unit. He took his train­
ing at the Fitzsimmon hospital at 
Denver, Colorado, and was commis­
sioned a second lieutenant last year 
in the Administration Services of 
the Medical Corps.
W. A. Heindal, ’39, is a lieutenant 
in the Ordnance Department, sta­
tioned at Rochester, N. Y., and is 
engaged in supervising ordnance in­
spection with industrial compan­
ies in the northern section of New 
York.
H. C. May, ’40, from Houston, 
Texas, wrote on October 6 that he 
is somewhere in England “having 
a good time; but the States, partic­
ularly Texas, will look good to me 
again.”

chosen for the record recital to be

Let’s Not Stand On Formality; 
Tech Abners Are More Receptive
“Heh there Zeke! Start eating 
your Hemo; November 6 is Sadie 
Hawkins’ Day!”
Once upon a time there lived in 
Techpatch a turrible homely gal 
named Sadie Hawkins. Now it 
was way past marryin’ time for S.
H., but her warts and baloon-nose 
seemed to scare the fellers off. Now 
Sadie’s old man, being a resource­
ful fellow with C701-2 behind him, 
recognized this as a problem in­
volving social and economic ele­
ments, dragged out the S. P. E. E. 
report and, discarding point one, 
proceeded to make a critical analy­
sis. He read with discrimnation and 
purpose toward these ends, per­
using How to Make a Man Happy 
and Fifty Questions for Women.
Having arrived at an Intelligent 
opinion about the problem and uti­
lizing his ability to express his 
thoughts clearly and convincingly 
in lucid oral and written English, 
he formulated a document of great 
importance to all eligible draft- 
dodgers in town. Thus, he writ: 
“Whereas: We have here a fine 
woman, my daughter, interested in 
helping some nice young feller with 
the development of the moral, eth­

man enough to succeed in the at­
tainment of an interest and pleasure 
in these pursuits, and thus an in­
spiration to continued study, be it 
resolved:
“November 6 be ever hereafter 
known as Sadie Hawkins’ Day, the 
period to be devoted to the study of 
Social Relations on a most pressing, 
if microcosmic, scale. Fellers, you 
got an hour’s head start. If you’re 
took before sundown, you’re hook­
ed. Start a’runnin’.”
Some groups hold to the idea 
that certain topics are beyond the 
consideration of mortal man, but 
the intrepid Techite, schooled in the 
philosophy that the scientific meth­
od can tackle anything that exists, 
might with impunity question a sit­
uation which has grown up around 
campus. Despite the fact that the 
men-women ratio is definitely on 
the up-grade, a large group of the 
girls have still not arrived at that 
delectable situation involving in­
formal relationships with the oppo­
site sex. It is the belief of quite a 
group that this difficulty has been 
amplified in the minds of some stu­
dents to the point where the possi­
bility of agreeable contact with the 
other group seem rather slight. 
Noticing the parallel of this to 
poor S. H., some of the more des­
perate Techites resolved to apply 
past successes to the present prob­
lem and get into the race again.
Let no one fall into the mistaken 
impression that Sadie Hawkins’ 
Day serves no purpose other than 
aiding the poor gals sans hommes. 
There is now an even greater rea­
son for promoting easily-made ac­
quaintances among the gang. The

1943 Football Season Ends; 
45-6 Tally Doesn’t Tell Story
Tech’s gallant squad suffered its 
worst defeat at the hands of the 
Panther last Saturday, but never­
theless it was one of the hardest 
fought games of the season. Old 
Andy C., wherever he is, must have 
been just as proud of those “kids” 
as he was of the great ’38 Sugar 
Bowl aggregation. Anyone who 
missed Saturday’s game missed the 
greatest exhibition of school spirit 
and plain “guts” that Pittsburgh has 
seen in a long, long time. The sick­
ening 45-6 score doesn’t show it, but 
the boys were in there fighting; and 
when they scored that six-pointer, 
they received a thundering ovation.
Dave Crump, veteran guard, was 
taken to the hospital late in the 
game and serious injury was feared. 
However, Dave’s appearance at the
I. F. dance the same night was a 
pleasant surprise to all. His super 
playing, though, was no surprise. 
Through the entire season, he has 
been a consistent threat to would- 
be passers and runners.
A few of the boys took on the 
appearance of star ball players, even 
though their feats were of little 
consequence in the outcome. Irwin 
Breier, halfback, exhibited a good 
deal of speed and excellent broken 
field running, besides tossing the 
27-yard touchdown pass. Immedi­
ately after entering the game, he 
took the kickoff on his own 20 and 
brilliantly eluded most of the Pan­
thers till he was finally nailed on 
the 45. Later he executed a 30 yard 
end run only to have it nullified by 
an offensive penalty. Ghizzoni was 
the lad on the other end of Breier’s 
touchdown pass and managed to 
make his presence known on de­
fense also. Reid Byers, star full­
back last year, returned to the line­
up for the first time this season and 
in spite of his short training peri­
od punched holes in the Pitt for­
ward wall.
Events leading up to Tech’s lone 
touchdown are probably the most 
interesting — to Techites anyway. 
With the score 39-0, Pitt’s kickoff 
was taken by Robbins to the Tech 
44. Tech fumbled but recovered — 
losing 9 yards. A pass to Robbins 
was incomplete. Breier took the
ball and raced to the left behind 
beautiful blocking. Outdistancing 
the Pitt linemen he cut and raced 
down the sidelines to the Panther 
30. But Tech was offside and the 
ball was brought back to the Tar­
tan 30. Another pass fell dead. Then 
Litton, the kicker, moved into the 
backfield. Instead of kicking, he 
dashed around left end, following 
the sidelines to the Pitt 40. Follow­
ing an unprofitable rush and an in­
complete pass, Pitt presented us 
with a first down by clipping. With 
the ball on the 25, Breier’s right end 
run was nipped on the 30. Goode 
was stopped at the scrimmage line. 
Breier passed to Litton for 5 yards, 
then to Robbins for one, and Pitt 
took over on their own 24. Carey 
went to the 37 for a first. Then Pitt 
took a 5 yard backfield in motion 
penalty. Gale Litton smothered 
Carey on the 25. Breier nailed Fox 
on the 29. Kield was caught on the
17. Pitt kicked and recovered 
Goode’s fumble on their own 41. 
Steytler was smeared on the 33. Pitt 
was penalized 5 yards for excessive 
time out. Linelli picked up 5 yards, j 
Goode’s pass to Litton was broken 
up. Breier passed to Ghizzoni for 
the touchdown. Breier’s kick for 
the extra point was blocked.
Intramural Board
Entries for Intramural Volleyball 
are due on Friday, November 5th, 
at five o’clock, according to an an­
nouncement from the Intramural 
Board last week. Only civilian en­
tries will be accepted due to the fact 
that AST men will not be able to 
compete in the hours during which 
the gym is available.
Bowling begins next Saturday, all 
games that day being between ci­
vilian teams, due to the fact that the 
Army men are on furlough and will 
not be able to compete until the 
following week.
Intramural Board meetings have 
been set for Tuesdays at 5 o’clock 
in the conference room in Indus­
tries Hall. All complaints or ques­
tions about intramurals should be 
brought before the board at their 
meetings. ________

Tech Cheerleaders doing
Mystery Solved 
He’s A1 Minetti
It never fails. Comes the half, 
and up goes the cry, first low and 
disorganized, slowly louder and 
more unified, “We want Al!” Those 
who know what to look for search 
the benches at the side of the field 
for a short figurr in brown. When 
the clamor becomes persistent, up 
pops the wise old showman who 
hands his jacket to the cheerleader, 
and with perfect timing lets out an 
“I-n-s-t-i-t-u-t-e,” poses until he 
leads the stand with him, then leads 
them to a crescendo that he un­
failingly punctuates with a somer­
sault.
After the cheer is over and the 
Carnegie rooters return to their 
normally unresponsive selves, the 
uninitiated always asks, “Who is he, 
anyhow?” The answer is always a 
reluctant, “I don’t know.”
Here is the answer to the inevita­
ble question:
“Al” is Al Minetti, who graduat­
ed from the College of Engineering 
in 1925. He was a cheerleader for 
three years, and is considered the
best we have ever had. Al says 
that in his student days discipline 
was more rigid, so that when the 
barriers were lowered students 
wanted to enjoy themselves, and 
the cheerleader was responsible for 
making football games entertaining. 
Cheerleaders were then chosen be­
cause of audience appeal and ability 
to perform. Al has never attempted 
to analyze the reasons for his tra­
ditional popularity with the stands. 
He interprets it was an accident, 
but he says, “It certainly makes a 
fellow feel swell.”
During his college career Al was 
a member of the Glee Club and the 
Burlesque Committee. The Com­
mittee was responsible for pepping 
up Campus Week, and each year 
its members donned police uni­
forms and roamed around, disrupt­
ing traffic downtown, and adding to 
the merriment on campus.
A position with the United States 
Army Engineers keeps Al on the 
run, but he doesn’t remember hav­
ing missed a home game for fifteen 
years. Tech fans have seen him 
perform his famous somersault in 
snow and mud.
He thinks we always stand a 
chance against Pitt. He likes to re­
call our 1928 victory over the Pitt 
Panthers . . . and this year again 
he was out there, somersaulting to 
the cheers.

one of the profsC. I. T. Prof’s Play Now At Nixon
By Lucille Schulberg
When the average freshman en­
ters Tech he does not have to wait 
long before meeting Dean War­
den, Dean Jones, and Doctor Doher­
ty. They are introduced to him the 
very first day as the men who con-
trol and guide him in all his schol­
astic endeavors. There is a fourth 
man, however, who is just as im­
portant in the affairs of any Tech 
student. That man is Dean Mur­
phy, the unofficial head of all extra­
curricular activities on the Carnegie 
campus.
Dean Murphy’s official title is Ad­
visor on Financial affairs, in which 
capacity he is known to students 
as the man to see for jobs, scholar­
ships, and loans. Perhaps his most 
important function on campus, how­
ever, is his direction of almost any 
activity not connected directly with 
the classroom. He is advisor to 
ACAC, and serves in the position 
with Interfraternity Council; he is 
chairman of the fraternity faculty 
advisors’ committee, heads Fresh-
Girls Urged To Write To 
Former Techites Overseas
Now that Christmas is approach­
ing, the boys in the service will 
want to hear from home. Mrs. Yon 
is asking all girls to get the name 
and address of a former Carnegie 
student, now overseas, from her list.
Informal Christmas letters from 
the girls at school will bring these 
boys cheer. These letters may tell 
how thé campus has changed—the 
Beanery is the ASTP mess-hall, and 
the P X and the Canteen are in the 
Hut. A copy of the TARTAN will be 
of interest,' too. A number will be 
given to the girls in case they don’t 
wish to sign their names.
Girls, won’t you please cooperate, 
and make the boys happier this 
Christmas with a letter» from their 
school? Stop in at Mrs. Yon’s office, 
and get a serviceman’s name.

man orientation, and this year, he 
helped supervise Intramural ath­
letes. As if these jobs were not 
enough to keep him busy. Dean 
Murphy helped out as an extra 
physical education instructor this 
fall.
Dean Murphy is the ideal man 
at Tech for all of these positions: 
he is young, personable, and pre­
sents anything but the stuffy ap­
pearance usually associated with 
that of a college dean. As proof of 
this ask any member of the football 
team who the husky young man 
was who worked out with the squad 
the first few weeks of football prac­
tice this fall.
Penn State and the Delta Tau 
Delta fraternity occupied much of 
Dean Murphy’s life before he came 
to Tech three years gao. He start­
ed at State taking Physical Educa­
tion, but later transferred to the 
school of commerce and finance. He 
was a Delt at State and after work­
ing as field secretary for his old 
fraternity after his graduation in 
1938, he took up his work here in 
1940. He believes that the most ur­
gent need at Tech right now is for 
a canteen where everyone can get 
together. He also desires a more 
complete participation in extra­
curricular activities on the parts of 
both civilians and soldiers. For as 
the man who should know says, - 
“activities are important for the 
personality.”

ASTP seems to affect every ques­
tion materially, and certainly the 
Spirit of Sadie Hawkins cannot rest 
in peace knowing that there are so 
many readily available uniforms on 
campus.
Just think what understanding 
between the collective Sadie Haw­
kins and the collective ASTP men 
would mean to soldier-civilian rela­
tions. Yes, just think. Now’s the 
chance to land that nice looking 
section leader, kids! Little infor­
malities which might be consider­
ed below the exalted standing of 
Carnegie women will be smiled at 
condescendingly by those who em­
ployed the same tactics before, and 
the infirmary has promised to treat 
all broken backs from flying tackles. 
With the assurance that any little 
improprieties will be amply taken 
care of or properly ignored, noth­
ing can stop the intrepid wolfus 
from learning at least how many 
men do not like her, a bit of infor­
mation usually hard to obtain.

What the Drama Department 
feels is its godchild is at last home 
in Pittsburgh. Uncle Harry, by 
Drama - Professor-on - leave - in - 
Hollywood Thomas Job arrived at 
the Nixon Theatre last night, in­
tact and very good. This play is a 
new sort of murder job with a def­
initely new type murder. Uncle 
Harry is a sweet meek man, chained 
to two sisters by their devotion. The 
worm turns a little and one mur­
der rids him of both sisters, leav­
ing Uncle Harry free—to be un­
happy about it the rest of his life.
Although the play was written 
while Mr.-Job was with the Yale 
Drama Department, the pangs of its 
being prepared for New York were 
borne by the Drama Department 
here—and Mr. Job.
Thomas Job is a Welshman with 
a quirk in the corner of his mouth 
and a clipped accent. He would 
come back from mad flights to New 
York to attend to casting and re­
hearsals with cryptic little stories 
with which he regaled the dramat 
table in the Beanery.
One of the tales that I enjoyed 
the most was Mr. Job’s story of 
scene rewriting during rehearsals. 
It seems an author is often called 
upon to change dialogue in the 
following manner: Director says,
“Take five (minutes). Mr. Job, this 
scene is a bit too humorous. Re­
write it, won’t you?” In the five 
minutes, the playwrite hies him­
self to the property room, usually 
a tiny cupboard crowded with elk’s
heads and broken chairs, sits him­
self at a typewriter propped on a 
box, disregards the people walk­
ing in and out laughing, and re­
writes the scene.
Joseph Schildkraut, who plays 
¦Uncle Harry, is a very well-known 
actor and the son of a wellknown 
actor. But he is an impulsive sort 
of man . When he read the script 
of Mr. Job’s play he got so enthu­
siastic about it and the part of one 
of Uncle Harry’s sisters, that he 
telephoned Eva Le Galliene, three 
states away ,lay in his bed with the 
telephone in one hand and the script 
in another and read her scene after 
scene until she took the part. So 
Eva Le Gallienne and Joseph Schild­
kraut are leading the company now 
as they did during its long run on 
Broadway.
Miss Le Gallienne, one of the the­
atre’s most splendid people, will be 
at school as a guest of Miss Mary 
Morris of the Drama faculty some­
time this week so there’s no need 
now to tell all about her, except, 
perhaps to mention how very good 
she is in Uncle Harry.
Pepe, for so Mr. Shildkraut has 
been nicknamed, is good, too. 
Everybody and everything about 
the play is good.

There will be a compulsory meet­
ing of the Tartan staff on Friday,

All College Party 
Nov. 6 at the Union
If you are wondering what to do 
on the evening of November 6, save 
that brain matter for something 
more difficult. On November 6, the 
first evening school social of the 
1943-44 season will be held at the 
Carnegie Union, corner of Beeler and 
Forbes Streets. This is one party 
that you don’t want to miss; it is 
open to all evening school students 
in Engineering, Fine Arts, and 
Margaret Morrison, and their 
friends.
The social’s theme will be autumn 
with all its bright and gay colors 
blending in with a cheery time. 
Roulette, which has been a popular 
attraction, will again be prominent, 
with prizes to the winners. There 
will be all sorts of dancing (includ­
ing polkas and square dancing), the 
music to be supplied by the latest 
juke box offerings. Refreshments 
—candy, cakes, and soft drinks— 
will be served. If you are a ping 
pong fiend and are looking for some 
competition, this is where to find it.
This party is just the place to get 
acquainted with your fellow stu­
dents. Any member of the armed 
forces will be admitted free. So 
come on out and join in the fun.
I Travelled By Coach 
Moral:—Don't Travel
I’m white, believe it or not. But 
after that trip to New York, even 
my mother had trouble recognizing 
me. I remember them good old 
days when going on a train trip was 
a pleasure. Today, it’s almost more 
than a poor soul like me can take. 
But then I wouldn’t let a little dirt 
and discomfort stop me from see­
ing my man, especially since I 
hadn’t seen him for eight long 
months. Well, I finally squeezed on 
the train and, lo and behold, I got- 
a seat. After riding for about an 
hour, my eyes finally got used to 
the cinders and my heart ached at 
the sight before me — servicemen 
from all branches curled up in some 
of the most uncomfortable-looking 
positions imaginable, trying to 
catch a few winks. When I finally 
reached my destination I got off the 
train with but one thought in mind 
—never to go anywhere on the train 
unless it was absolutely necessary; 
and I hope that some of the people 
reading this article will profit by 
my experience.
Get Your Plaid By Mail
Are you getting your Plaid reg­
ularly? Do you neglect to pick it 
up in the hallways and thus miss 
out on Campus News? Do you 
know when the social affairs are to 
be held? Perhaps you’d like to as­
sure yourself of receiving the paper 
weekly.
This can be done by having it 
mailed to your home for $1.10 per 
school year. If interested, send 
your name and the money to Eve­
ning Student Council, Box 353, Car­
negie Institute of Technology, 
Pittsburgh, Pa.
Now that the fumes of Halloween 
pranks have died down and nobody 
has suffered any broken bones, it 
seems to me that everybody ought 
to be in tip-top shape for the com­
ing Evening All-College Party. 
What’s this coming in? Looks as 
is I spoke a minute too soon! One 
of the staff members just hobbled 
in. Let’s see!—bandaged nose, arm, 
leg and elbow. Thought it was Jo 
masquerading for a minute, but I 
suppose someone (can’t see who it 
is until he comes out from under 
hiding) has been the victim of a 
practical Halloween joke. Come 
now! Wouldn’t life be boring with­
out such surprises now and then? 
. . . Seems to me Ginny Gass is all 
a-flutter over her man in the Air 
Corps who is at present stationed in 
Alabama—so that’s why she bump­
ed into me the other day when I 
was walking down the hall! . . . 
Here’s a new one for you! Lois 
Dollhopf claims she wears that be­
witching black dress to Chem Lab 
so that if she accidentally spills 
something on it, she won’t care too 
much—has her eye on a new one. 
(A likely story isn’t it? Haven’t 
heard so many “Eyes Right” com­
mands from the Tech A.S.T.P. Unit 
as I have heard lately) . . .
We hear that tall dark and hand­
some gent in the Metallurgy de­
partment is still unmarried. Girls! 
Tsk! Tsk! You can do better than 
that—or are you waiting for Leap 
Year to roll around? Why wait 
girls—Sadie Hawkins Day is closer 
yet. Look out boys! Attention 
Flanders—just a kiss in the dark, 
or don’t you read Lil Abner? We 
wonder what influence Cookie Noll 
has on those officials at the County 
Airport — they hold up airplane 
schedules 5 minutes just for her. 
How does she do it?
John Hundertmark was seen last 
Friday night walking down the hall 
with “Guess Who’s Wife?” We saw 
you John . . . Nancy Lewis is no 
doubt sweating it out in the heat 
of Panama. At least she gets to 
see the sun which is more than we 
can say . . . Uncle Sammy is going 
to outfit John Groll in a nice new 
suit very soon.
Those two blondes who finally 
came back to work last week both 
had good excuses for their absences. 
It seems both the Army and Ma­
rines landed, and as usual, had the 
situation well in hand!
Anyone coming to school these 
evenings around 6:45 on any Forbes 
Street trolley can be entertained 
by the A. S. T. P. boys. We thought 
we were on a troop train—Woo! 
Woo! Hope we get the same street 
car next week. P. S. We got a 
seat . . .

Plaid Staff Halloweens
The PLAID staff braved the ter­
rors of Halloween pranksters, gob­
lins and witches, Saturday, October 
30, to attend a party held at the Bo­
hemian Hall in Wilmerding. Every­
body was looking their best—they 
had masks on. A large black 
market ham satisfied the appetites 
of all present. That big-mouthed 
person (not mentioning any names) 
had a slight advantage in dunking 
and biting the apples.

During the Student Council meet­
ing which preceded the last election 
party, a controversy ensued that 
has not yet been settled. This is­
sue deals with a motion made at the 
last meeting to eliminate the nec­
essity of an individual’s having 
earned an insignia award in order 
to become eligible for election to 
Student Council.
I think that this qualification 
should be stricken from the list of 
requirements for eligibles for the 
following reasons:
The amount of representation in 
proportion to the total enrollment 
is too small, and it is obvious that 
this due to the fact that many who 
would otherwise qualify for office 
do not have insignias.
Any individual who has enough 
of a following in his respective 
school to be elected by his class­
mates should be permitted to hold 
office, since that department would 
then be fairly represented.
Because of the fact that those 
who haven’t earned insignias are 
barred from elections to office, the 
schools are not well represented in 
Council, because turnouts at the 
Election parties are so small, that 
it becomes necessary for the Pres­
ident to appoint officers, thereby 
doing away altogether with the 
privilege of voting. It is a question 
then of whether it is better to have 
no representation in the school gov­
ernment, or to govern with the best 
representatives available.
Those disagreeing with the aboVe 
point of view contended that: Any­
one with a reasonable amount of in­
terest in school affairs would en­
gage in as many activities as possi­
ble, thereby earning an insignia 
award.
Those who would hold a job in 
Council, must accept responsibili­
ties of an administrative nature. 
This type of a job calls for someone 
who is dependable, active, shows 
an interest in, and is well acquaint­
ed with school affairs. The best 
way an individual has of proving 
that he possesses these qualities is 
by taking active part in school ac­
tivities, and thereby earning an 
award.
As yet this dispute has not yet 
been settled, and probably will not 
be until Student Council knows the 
concensus of opinion among the stu­
dent body. Any expression of opin­
ion can be made verbally to any 
Council member who in turn will 
report it to Council, Box 353, C. I. T.
