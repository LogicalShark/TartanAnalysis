BASE-BALL AND TRACK 
PRACTICE.
The Tech base-ball team met 
the fast State boys on last Satur­
day in a game that will be remem­
bered by them for some time. 
Heretofore, while the best of feel­
ing has existed between the 
schools, State has been reluctant 
to consider Tech as an opponent 
worthy her best efforts, but Sat­
urday’s game must have success­
fully dispelled these doubts. Tech 
got a lead in the second inning 
which was held throughout the 
game until the ninth when with 
two out, and no one on bases, an 
error was made 011 a difficult 
chance. The next man up made 
a triple and tied the score. At 
the end of the eleventh inning, 
the game was called by agree­
ment on account of the State- 
Lafayette track meet.
Tech’s success was largely due 
to the magnificent work of Wills 
and Barclay. Wills struck out 
12 State basmen and in one in­
ning retired the side on strikes. 
But two safe drives outside the 
diamond was State’s total for 11 
innings, their other two safe hits 
being well-placed bunts. Bar­
clay caught Wills in masterly 
fashion, catching the only runner 
who tried to steal on him, and 
catching two high fouls after 
spectacular hurdling over a lot of 
track apparatus.
The team was without the ser­
vices of Capt. Lytle, but “Lajoie” 
Kirk filled his position at 2d per­
fectly, making several clever 
(Continued on page 2.)
On last Saturday morning the 
W. U. I’, track team defeated our 
squad by a score of 68 to 50. The 
weather was the “worst ever,” 
but the meet proved to be one of 
the most interesting and exciting 
held in this section for some time. 
Tech showed up in remarkable 
form and made their opoonents 
go the limit to take the honors.
Our “Wink” was the star of the 
meet, making 20 points for his 
side by winning first in the 120- 
yard hurdles, the 220-yard dash 
and 440-yard dash, and taking 
second in the 100-yard dash and 
in the 220-yard hurdles. In the 
440-yard dash he ran a dead heat 
with Charles.' W. U. P. was a 
little sore over losing the 22a-yard 
dash to Dowling and claimed 
that he had fouled Banbury, but 
the judges would not allow the 
foul. Capt. Zicg and the Ban- 
burys were the maiTistay of the 
W. U. P. team, the 12-pound 
hammer record being broken by 
Zieg at a distance of 159 feet, 9 
inches. Knotts of W. U. P., won 
the mile run in a sensational man­
ner, finishing quite a distance 
ahead of Thompson, so he looks 
good for a star runner next sea­
son. The meet was not as well 
attended as it would have been in 
the event of good weather. Sum­
mary :
100-yard dash—Q. Banbury, 
W. U. P., first ; Dowling, Tech, 
second; Charles, Tech, third; 
time, 104-5 seconds.

plays. In fact, the support given 
to Wills was snappy and accurate 
throughout the game.
The score does not indicate the 
consistent batting of the Tech 
boys, as many cleverly placed 
drives went to naught, through 
the fast fielding of the State 
team. In view of the facts that 
State’s base-ball team has not 
been beaten on the home grounds 
in 11 years and that their team 
has had so brilliant a record this 
season, the Tech boys consider 
the tie game a virtual victory.

NOTES.
Mr. Mamatey, instructor of ma­
chine shop practice, has been in 
Detroit for the past week.
Bert Turner, 09, was subjected 
to a rather unpleasant experience 
last Wednesday evening. His 
colleagues at the Woodlawn Cot­
tage, much interested in his per­
sonal appearance, insisted that his 
locks be shorn. Turner, how­
ever, bitterly opposed the idea, 
and not until “physical persua­
sion" was brought into play could 
he be induce 1 to visit the ton- 
sorial artist. Over through Schen- 
ley Park past the uniformed spon­
sors*:^ the law, thence up Forbes 
street to the Tech barber shop, 
the “struggling Bert” was car­
ried. Once in the shop the des­
peradoes stopped to contemplate 
their way and were dismayed 
to find that if the hair was to be 
cut they must do the cutting. 
“Bob of Newcastle,” was chosen 
to do the work and with a few 
deft movements of the shears and 
poor Bert’s locks fell to the 
ground.
A prominent builder of rolling 
mill machiner in this district has 
donated a complete set of detail 
blue prints of an eight-inch mill 
train, also a set of detail blue 
prints of a machine to cut cold 
soft steel up to one inch square. 
They will be used by the students’ 
in the design of an experimental 
mill.

was the verdict.
Carnegie Tech Architectural

School nine of Turtle Creek in a 
well played game on last Satur­
day. Tech was strong in the in­
field. A sensational double play 
in the ninth inning with two men 
on bases spoiled High School’s 
chances to tie the score. The

THE SWEDE WAS RIGHT.
An automobilist, making a cross­country tour in Dakota, had the mis­
fortune to have his machine break 
down. He saw a small house not far 
off and cut across to it. The only 
man about the place was a Swede, 
who was much amused by the sight 
of the strange rig the automobilist 
wore. “My friend,” said the auto­
mobilist, “my machine has had a bad 
break and I would like to know if 
you have such a thing as a monkey- 
wrench about here?”
The Swede looked at the automo­
bilist with greater curiosity than ever, 
and then laughed. He had met some 
strange folks and heard some odd 
things since he had come to America, 
but this was the worst! “Monkey- 
wranch?” he asked sarcastically. “I 
got a sheep ranch and my cousin, Ole, 
he got a cow ranch, and Meester Fer­
guson he ban have wan pig ranch, 
but I tank annywan start a monkey 
ranch in Nord Dakota ban wan fool!”

TWO POINTS OF VIEW.
A junior barrister was hurrying 
across to the Law Courts when he al 
most collided with a cab. The driver, 
who had pulled up with a jerk, pro­nounced his opinion in plain English 
about absent-minded people.
“Couldn’t you see the bloomin’ 
’oss?” he asked with withering sar­
casm.
“See him!” gasped the startled 
barrister, looking contemptuously at 
the animal between the shafts. Then 
he stepped onto the curb. “I didn’t 
see your horse when I stood in front 
of him,” he added, “but I can see 
something when I look at him side­
ways!”
He found the hair was leaving the 
top of his head, and took his barber 
to task about it.“You sold me two bottles of stuff 
to make this hair grow.”
“It is very strange it won’t grow 
again,” interrupted the barber. “I 
can’t understand it.”“Well, look here,” said the man, “I 
don’t mind drinking another bottle, 
but this must be the last.”
A JOKE ON THE DENTIST.
“Well, Mrs. Finnegan, hov yer hod 
yure tooth pulled?”« . ' ,“Yis; an’ begorra! th* jjo&e's on th’

THE TECHNICAL GRADU­
ATE AND THE MANU­
FACTURING CO.
The changes which have occur­
red in the lifetime of the young 
men of the present day surpass 
in many features those which 
have occurred during many cen­
turies. The rate of progress, 
moreover, is an accelerating rate. 
The value of the manufactured 
products of the United States 
have doubled in value in less than 
twenty years. This is significant 
of a new order of things. En­
gineering is not only the basis of 
this material change; but it is also 
the underlying condition which 
has brought about the new polit­
ical, economic and social evolu­
tion. These facts are well known. 
They have come to be regarded 
as almost commonplace. It is 
important, however, that we real­
ize their significance in order that 
we may better understand the 
present tendencies and anticipate 
the qualifications which the fu­
ture engineer should possess.
Two institutions have grown 
up within the past few years, with 
which we are very intimately con­
cerned. These are the technical 
school and the large manufactur­
ing company. In engineering 
education the ideals, the methods 
and the facilities are all new. 
The engineering graduate is a 
new product. He is a new factor 
in the world’s work.
Educational methods are not 
fixed and definite. They are 
vastly different from those of a 
generation ago, and the engineer­
ing educational methods of the 
near future may be quite different 
from those of to-day.
Closely related to this develop­
ment in engineering education is 
that of the manufacturing com­
pany. In electrical engineering, 
in particular, the growth of the 
school and of, the industry have 
had a close relationship. Each
has been, to a greater or less de­
gree, dependent upon and aided 
by the other. In the days of our 
fathers, manufacturing was car­
ried on in a small way, usually 
one man was at the head of a 
given business; personally famil­
iar with and directing its various 
departments. He devised pro­
cesses, directed the manufacture 
and was his own sales agent. 
Modern manufacturing, however, 
is of a different kind. The vari­
ous functions formerly performed 
bv one man require the co-opera- 
tion of many men in a single or­
ganization. Each is an expert, 
and altogether they act as a pow­
erful unit.
Thus, co-operation—or the cor­
poration—has become the modern 
method. It is the method, more­
over, by which modern engineer­
ing is conducted. Enterprises, 
except those which are small or 
of a particular kind, cannot be 
conducted b r a single individual. 
The co-laboration of many men 
is required for larger undertak­
ings. Hence, the necessity of the 
engineer being able to work effi­
ciently with others.
The large electrical manufac­
turing company is typical of mod­
ern manufacturing and business 
methods. It may be noted that 
the products of the electric com­
panies, which are now produced 
in values exceeding a humlred 
million dollars a year, would have 
had no market thirty years ago, 
as they would have been practi­
cally useless. The work of these 
companies, in general, is broad in 
its scope; it includes invention, 
development, design, manufac­
ture and erection, as wrell as the 
sales and financial departments. 
To carry on this work such com­
panies are divided into many de­
partments. Technical men find 
their field in those departments 
which are concerned with engin­
eering, either directly or indirect­
ly, and furthermore, the engineer-

ing training is found in many 
cases to be an excellent prepara­
tion for those engaged in more 
purely executive work.
There was an old-time idea that 
the theoretically trained young 
man was completely equipped for 
doing engineering work, and that 
he was at fault if he was not im­
mediately prepared ''to produce 
efficient results. This view, how­
ever, is based upon several mis­
conceptions. First of all is the 
relation between knowledge and 
experience. One may know his 
theory and his formulae, but en­
gineering problems are not ab­
stract, they are concrete. They 
deal not merely with forces but 
with materials. One must know 
the constants of his materials and 
the uses of the products. These 
come from experience. The de­
signer of appartus must not only 
know the theoretical principles 
which are involved, but he must 
know the various qualities, elec­
trical and mechanical, of the 
many, many materials which he 
must use. He must be familiar 
with the methods of using these 
materials and the manufacturing 
facilities which will insure cheap

and rapid production. He must 
be familiar with the service con­
ditions so that he may design ap­
paratus which will not only meet 
reliably the electrical and mechan­
ical requirements of normal oper­
ation, but which will safely with­
stand the emergency conditions 
which are liable to arise. His 
apparatus must be adapted to the 
class of men who will use it. It 
must work properly with the 
other apparatus in the system in 
which it is to be placed. It must, 
in short, meet commercial condi­
tions in a manner which will 
prove acceptable to those who 
purchase it. A gain of a percent 
in efficiency or in regulation is of 
minor consequence if a machine 
has bad bearings which overheat. 
It follows, therefore, that even the 
designer, who has probably more 
to do with theory than those in 
any other department, has to be 
familiar with many other points 
besides his theory. Experience, 
creative imagination, foresight as 
to the effects of new combina­
tions and ne forms, good judg­
ment, integrity, not only with 
people but in dealing with facts, 
tact and the ability to get along
comfortably and efficiently with 
other people, together with a 
goodly measure of all-round com­
mon sense, are qualities which 
must supplement the knowledge 
of formulae in order to effect the 
best results.
Those who are engaged in test­
ing departments, in inspection, in 
erection, as well as in the various 
departments of commercial engin­
eering and sales, require in a 
large measure that same breadth 
of view and qualities which have 
just been enumerated.
The manufacturing companies 
have recognized that the man im­
mediately from college requires 
a further training. He needs ex­
perience, a new point of 
view. Engineering apprenticeship 
courses are therefore arranged in 
which he may gain familiarity 
with manufacturing and testing 
operations and also, what is of 
scarcely less importance, an im­
mediate knowledge and acquaint­
ance with the working together 
of many men in a great organiza­
tion.
Young men in college are de­
voting their energies to prepara­
tion for their life work. It be-
7
hooves them to expend their ef­
forts as efficiently as is possible. 
They will do well first of all to 
learn fundamental principles, to 
gain theory not merely in the 
abstract but through their labor­
atory work to gain a concrete 
ohysical understanding of these 
principles. A knowledge of spe­
cific things, such as particular 
kinds of apparatus or the charac­
teristics of special materials used 
in manufacturing processes, is of 
less consequence. Practice 
changes; principles do not. 
The student must not em­
phasize knowledge as distinguish­
ed from training. Training, which 
enables him to use his knowledge, 
is of first consequence. The man 
who is trained in observation, 
whose logical and reasoning pow­
ers are alert, who is able thereby 
to efficiently apply t'he knowledge 
which he has, will probably be 
much more effective and success­
ful than his companion who may 
know more, but can do less. A 
skillful workman with poor tools 
can accomplish more than a me­
diocre workman with the best of 
tools. Many of those who select 
college graduates look for the suc­
cessful leaders in student organ­
izations rather than those who 
head their classes. The man who 
combines both kinds of leadership 
gives especial promise. Many 
students do not get this broader 
view of their work. They do not 
apply engineering methods to 
themselves. Each man may well 
consider himself as a machine, as 
something with which to produce 
results. He should study how he 
may produce the best results with 
the least effort. Many are al­
ready quite proficient insofar as 
the “least effort" is concerned. 
The real problem, however, is 
with reasonable effort to nroduce 
maximum output. It is probable 
that some who have seemingly 
expended but little effort have 
learned to work with greater effi­
ciency than the plodders who 
have received better class-room 
reports but a vastly greater ex­
penditure of effort. The man 
who had learned to handle himself 
and to work efficiently has a vast 
advantage when he does apply 
himself. This is one reason why

college grades do not give a true 
indication of future careers.
If students can take this larger 
broader and more serious view of 
their work, giving attention to 
the understanding of principles 
rather than the knowledge of 
facts, and recognizing that the 
training in the use of their powers 
is of scarcely less importance than 
the acquisition of these powers, 
then the college graduate will be­
come a more successful man both 
from his.own standpoint and that 
of usefulpei^ pothers.—;By C. F.

Why is Miss Crow applying 
herself so diligently to the study 
of certain of Emerson's poems?
On Monday morning the Glee 
Club held a concert before school 
began. The several selections 
were rendered unusually well and 
gave promise of great things to 
come. Miss Stutz ended the pro­
gram with a delightful “Spring 
Song.”
Miss Mary McKee and Miss 
Hattie Merril have had to leave 
school for a time on account of 
sickness. We all wish them a 
speedy recovery and hope they 
will be with us when we move.
Picnic weather is with us again, 
or rather “was.”
C. E. SOCIETY.
The Civil Engineering Society 
held its regular monthly meeting 
last Saturday evening at the home 
of Samuel Vincent, in Glassboro. 
After a lengthy business discus­
sion on the plans for the enlarge­
ment of the Society, with the 
opening of next fall term, and the 
theatre party to be given by Mr. 
Coursin before the close of this 
term. The society adjourned and 
were immediately placed under 
the guidance of its host, whose 
well laid plans, including a boun­
tiful repast, formed a fitting close 
to the evening’s business.
