CAMPAIGN OCT. 25-28
Three days, or intensive campaign­
ing, hard work, and concerted action 
are planned, by the committee in 
charge of the annual membership 
campaign, for the Carnegie Tech 
branch of the Y. M. C. A., which starts 
October 25. The committee of two 
hundred and fifty men headed by Jack 
Franklin will form a nucleus about 
which a 100%... membership in one 
of the most active institutions on the 
Carnegie campus will be built up.
Last year’s enrollment ineluded 
only one-third of the men students. 
An organization as worthy as the 
local branch of the Y. M. C. A. should 
not have the support of such a small 
<percentage of the students. Every 
male student in the institute should 
have the little membership card of 
the “Y” and should give the organ­
ization his unbounded support.
That, the Y. 'M. C. A. has been a 
success on the campus is proven by 
its many accomplishments. It has 
inaugurated the Senior Counsellor
‘Freshman Plan and arranged the 
Senior-Fresh man Dinner on Regis­
tration Day where the Freshmen met 
to become acquainted with the Seniors 
who are to be their advisors. The 
“Y” also arranges the monthly meet­
ings of the Freshman and his Senior 
advisor. The Institute Chapel receives 
the support and co-operation of the 
“Y” as do the churches in and about 
the Pittsburgh district in arranging 
their social affairs and on the tradi­
tional “Tech nights.”
The Discussion Groups are organ­
ized by the Carnegie Tech branch of 
the Y. M*. C. A.; visitation of the 
sick and the entertainment of the 
foreign students is also taken care of 
by this same organization. Each week 
the “Y” arranges a free swim at the 
Sc'nenley High School and during the 
Christmas vacation those students

Music Dpt. Gives New Course
A feature of the part time Depart­
ment-of Music course being offered at 
Carnegie Institute of Technology is 
the class devoted to the Technic of 
the Modern Orchestra Instruments. 
This new course will be of particular 
interest to concert goers as well as 
musicians, as every instrument be­
longing to the orchestra is fully ex­
plained, and discussed by instructors 
of long experience. There are no 
other entrance requirements other 
than the applicant be at least eight­
een years of age. The course will run 
until June 9, Mr., Victor Saudek be­
ing head of this new department.
The big day is a thing of the 
past. The game of last Saturday was 
a thriller long to .be remembered, 
and some of the Carnegie Tech 
students who bummed their way to 
the game will remember it for many 
other _ reasons.
As far as could be ascertained 
there were twelve who found that 
hiking was the best means of going 
to the game. These men averaged 
better time in making the trip than 
chose who rode on the special. 
Only two of the twelve had to walk 
more than five miles, and these two 
got on the wrong road and covered 
twenty miles. Lifts were plentiful.
Six of the bums had arrived by 
nine A. M. and they set out at once 
to see the town. Their impressions 
of the place were almost identical—j 
Washington is a ibig, overgrown, 
one-horse town of about twelve 
thousand inhabitants, eleven thous­
and nine hundred of them being 
loyal boosters of W. & J. The town 
has a wonderful court-house, the 
usual tag days so familiar to Pitts­
burgh people, plenty of restaurants, 
and some people who are really 
‘bugs’ when football is discussed. | 
Those people can’t imagine a Wash- 
Jeff team suffering defeat. In fact, 
one of the W. & J. players made 
the remark before the game that the 
team would be chased out of town 
if they were to lose. No wonder 
those fellows went crazy during the 
last few moments of play. These 
'bugs’ were positive that W. & J. 
would win at least 14 to 0 and were 
betting evep money on that score. 
The students, however, were not so 
confident. Some of the Plaid bum­
ming party called1 at one of the 
fraternity houses to visit some of 
their W. & J. friends and found that 
the fraternity 'brothers were not at 
all optimistic of the result. They 
knew the Tartan spirit; they knew 
the Carnegie Tech team—no wonder 
they were doubtful. They proved to 
be a fine bunch, were willing to 
answer questions, and show the visi­
tors around. But W. & J. certainly 
is different from Carnegie Tech. 
Their buildings are all grouped in 
one city block at Chestnut and College i 
streets. If all of these buildings were 
put together they would not cover 
as much ground as the Arts Build­
ing. There are four hundred students 
at Wash-Jeff, at least ten per cent of 
these are on the football team squads. 
Carngie Tech is a school made to 
turn out men and women with a 
thorough technical training. W. & J. 
turns out football men and physicans. 
We understand that they intend to 
increase their' enrollment next year 
so that they will have more physicans 
to take care of their team after the 
Carnegie Tech team gets through 
with them. Last year they beat us,

The Thistle campaign which closed 
bn Friday was extremely disappoint­
ing. Although the exact figures are 
not available at present, it would ap­
pear that not over five hundred copies 
have been subscribed for.
Industries Is leading the other 
three colleges from a standpoint of 
the number of copies sold. This rec­
ord was due largely to the efforts of 
one man.
As Jar as the classes go the Plebes 
have shown moró support than any of 
the upper classmen. This holds true 
In every school except Margaret Mor­
rison College.
The Junior class, which publishes 
the year book, is at the foot of the 
list in every school except the College 
of Engineering.
To date, the board has received no 
subscriptions from the Alumni. Per­
sonal solicitation is almost impossible 
when dealing with the graduate body.

SPECIAL RATES TO PENN
STATE OFFERED CARNEGIE 
STUDENTS C3Y PENNSY R. R.
The last big trip for the Cnrnegie 
Tech students will be the jaunt to 
Penn State on Saturday, Novem­
ber 11. Last year several 
hundred students made the jour­
ney, some by train, some by 
auto and a few walked. This year 
arrangements have been made for 
Carnegie Special. The Pennsylvania 
Railroad has offered us the rate of 
$6.20 for the round trip. It will be 
recalled that the 'cost of the train 
trip last year was practically twice 
this amount. In order to obtain the 
above price at least five hunlred tick­
ets must be sold.
Start a thrift campaign of your 
own. Have that $6.20 ready before 
November 11. We don’t want to 
stop at five hundred. Two,, special 
trains should be our goal. The team 
will need your support and Penn 
State will be a gracious host. Fol­

3,000 TECHITES ROOT AT GAME
In one of the most thrilling gridiron battles of tlio season, the Washing­
ton and Jefferson College warriors held Carnegie Tech to a 7-7 tie at Col­
lege Field last Saturday. Three thousand Tartan rooters showed Little 
Washington somo real college spirit as they cheered on the team from their 
positions in the south and west stands. Outclassed, outplayed and in the 
very shadow of defeat, Greasy Neale took a long chance and won, keeping 
the plaid from administering a defeat which would have beon the first on 
their home field since 1917.-------. —¦.From the opening kickoff the Ski-
'bos began to show a brand of foot­
ball both on the offensive and defen­
sive that was entirely superior to 
that of W. & J. A first down camo 
In the. first two plays followed up by 
two more in the same quarter while 
the Red and Black failed to negoti­
ate the necessary ton yards. It was- 
in this quarter that the red-'dad Loam 
started their march that resulted in 
a touchdown. Wost, advancing the 
ball for a ten-yard gain, lost it by a 
fuinblo on the Tartan 36-yard lino, 
Lamb recovering for Carnegie. Hero 
began a Berios of lino; plunges, Lamb 
carrying tlio ball, with an occasional 
end run of criss-cross piny to koop 
the Presidents guessing. The hall 
at last rostod on the W. & J. one- 
yard lino and In tlio noxt play Roib- 
ortson took It across when ho skirted 
the Rod and Black right end. Com­
fort, by a plncemont kick, added an­
other point, and the score stood at 
7 to 0. It was straight football for 
36 yards that brought; this touch­
down for the Plaid. Tholr advanco 
was IrruHlstlblo and W. &. J. fajjed 
to hold ovon In the shadow of their 
own goal posts.

Parades Held Down Town 
and in Little Washington 
by Student Body
The “Old Tech 'Spirit” went on 
another rampago last Friday night 
In the form of a send off for the 
football team. Pep and entliusiam 
predominated I ho feelings of the 
crowd which had assemblod to show 
the toam that they were 'behind them 
through victory or defeat.
The parade, hoadod by the band 
started from tlio field houso and 
marched to tlio front of the Central 
Building. Iloro It stoppod for a tlmo 
and clioora wore given. The new 
Carneglo song “Fight for the glory 
of Carnogle" was practiced so that 
It could be used at Washington the 
next day. The crowd 'them moved 
over on the lawn In frpnl. of tlio 
College of Flno Art» and gnvo more 
signs of enthusiasm. A snake dance 
was st.art.odi and Immediately every­
one fell In. Al’tor about a half hour 
of snake dancing tlio party' broke up, 
ovoryono going homo to get rostod 
up for the big ovont tlio noxt day.
At olovon-thlrty Saturday morning, 
about five hundred from the student 
body met behind tlio City Jail Build­
ing to have a parade down through 
town. Again hoadod by the 'band 
with the Scottish dnun-major, they 
inarched down Fifth Avenuo to Wood 
Street and across Wood to Water 
Stroot and up Water Street to the 
B. & O. station. The parado stoppod 
at Fifth and Smith field and with 
the cheerleader mounted on the roof 
of the Stato Thoator, which extends 
out ovor the «treot, several yells 
were given.
When the crowd got to Washington 
tlio Carnogle rooters marohod 
through the town. More cheers and 
songs and marching to /the tune 
of “Tech” "Toch" gave tlio Wash­
ington people a little Idea of how 
we support our team and college. 
The parado ended at the football 
field and then the big game started.

Wally Steffen Speaks 
At General Assembly
Student Council to Appoint 
Committee on Kilts
uofioh , “Wally” Steffen was Ilio 
principal speaker at the General As­
sembly hold last Wednesday noon In 
•Carneglo Musici Hall. Our coach re­
viewed at length the situations in­
volved In the W. & .1, game last 
year, and the Yale and W. & J. games 
of this season. He explained how 
through observation of these op'po* 
nets’ methods, a plan ifor defeating 
them, had been worked out In belli 
of the past games. A great surprise 
mot him at. Yale when ho found that 
his iilans had leaked out and were 
known there. However, barring fum­
bles, Yale could have' been defeated. 
“Wally” urged all to attend the 
game Saturday and explained how 
the backing afforded by a large body 
of loyal, energetic rooters aided in 
allaying the tremendous tension un­
der which tiie varsity men work dur­
ing tno play.
Ross I-Iertz led In cheers, and to 
the accompaniment of the band, led 
in rehearsal of the new song, "Fight 
for Llie Glory of Carnegie,” recently 
wrtten by 'Sanertz, 7-Ie also an­
nounced plans for parades, transpor­
tation and cheering on Saturday.
Entertainment was provided by tlio 
so-called "corporation.” Obie” New­
man, accompanied by Carl Snyder 
at the piano, sang “Moonlight” and 
a new original number “Somehow.” 
Later with Hertz completing the trio, 
they gave several harmony numbers 
and were recalled again and again 
for encores.

Enthusiastic Crowds View Senior
Fence as Structure is Unveiled
By T. S. Reppller.
(Special Correspondent for the 
Carnegie Tartan).
Never before has the Carnegie Cam­
pus witnessed such an Impressive 
and august ceremony as that which 
graced the formal opening of the long- 
awaited Senior fence last Monday. 
The movement to erect such a struc­
ture was originally brought up before 
the Student Council In 1632, and the 
Council has had a bit of trouble do- 
siding as to the correct number of 
boards necessary for Its construction, 
which accounts In a measuro for Its 
delay. In 1781, the matter was re­
ferred to a committee composed of 
Scienco and Industries men. but after 
the experimenting with log books and 
slide rules until 1788. the committee, 
reported that they favored Its con-j 
struetion with a round top Instead of 
a square one, as formerly advocated.
This caused a terrific uproar about 
the campus, and in 1777 Patrick Ilonry 
stated openly that he had no hesita­
tion In giving Ids ehtlre supporL to 
the square motif.
Prompt Actlpn Remarkable 
Last week, however, the Student 
Council passed the measure with only 
a two-thirds dissenting vote, exhausted 
by the flood of oratory launched in 
Its behalf by Representative Goophus. 
An expert carpenter was employed, 
with fourteen aflfdsLanls to aid him 
In the extremely (Ii.iUOuit task, and 
work was started at .once. Thé entire 
length of the cut, from Forbes, street 
to VVopdlawn avenue, was Immediate­
ly dug up and the concrete plies of 
tlje foundation erected. Dean ITowzat 
laid the cornerstone with tears in his 
voice, and many Seniors stood around 
ready to sit down at the slightest

JOIN THE Y. M. C. A.
COMMENTS
The Carnegie Y. M. C. A. is liere for the purpose of making 
"better men to represent our institution. -Everyone on the campus 
profits by its influence, directly or indirectly, during their sojourn 
here. Everj'-one is familiar with the unselfish work that’is heing clone 
by this organization throughout the country; but when it comes to 
support- there is a tendency to let the other fellow do it. Conceding 
that we npecl the “Y,” why not back it up? The annual enrollment 
campaign is being conducted and it is hoped that every Carnegie man 
will join this organization, that is doing so much good work on the 
campus.
THE FRATERNITY RUSHING PERIOD
Now that the- fraternity rushing period is over, the students 
should get their minds on their studies and work to make up for 
time lost, so as to make a creditable showing in the mid-semester ex­
aminations. It seems that the rushing period is rather long, but it 
can be determined only by careful consideration; no rules can be 
perfected without thorough trial which takes time.
THE KILTS ARE COMING
Definite action to secure kilts for the band has been started and 
it seems as though we are going to have the most distinctive band in 
the country in the near future.
The appointment of a committee by the Student Council is a step 
in the right direction.
NOT CARNEGIE SPIRIT
A practice which is common in the small colleges, such as paint­
ing numerals on campus buildings, flag rushes ancl class fights, has 
been discouraged here. This seems to be the idea of Carnegie spirit 
that is prevalent in the minds of the incoming class; but there should 
be no encouragement of this practice here because we do not want it.

ADRIFT ON MAIN STREET
In a small wid-western town I 
once saw a safe dependable family 
horse left alone on Main street with 
no hand on the reins. At first he be­
gan to walk, then to run, and in a 
few minutes had endangered many 
lives, smashed the carriage to pieces, 
and so injured himself that he had 
to be shot. Liberty is like fire; un­
der wise control an incalculable 
blessing; uncontrolled, an appaling 
agent of destruction. In this case 
sudden freedom from accustomed 
control, with no preparation for its 
proper xise, brought a useful career 
to a speedy and disastrous close. Lib* 
erty to the unprepared is always in­
toxication, often fatal.
Every year a hundred thousand 
boys are suddenly “turned loose’ 
the swarming Main Street of Amer­
ican college life. Most of them have 
never taken a step without feeling 
the pressure of the reins. In the 
“well-managed” home the careful par­
ents get the boy out of bed, see that 
he is properly dressed, send him to 
school oil time, control his visits 
downtown or to the picture show, 
make him study every night, and see 
to it that be doesn’t omit church.or 
Sunday school.
In the boarding school, especially 
of' the military type, the pressure of 
the reins is even more constant and 
compelling. Every waking hour 
governed, every act under compulsion. 
The more nearly the individual be­
comes passive cogs on the wheels 
of a resistless and smooth-running 
machine, the more perfect the “train­
ing” is supposed to be.
Meanwhile, to save trouble and pro­
tect themselves from critcism. the 
colleges insist on the fiction that 
these unprepared products of such a 
system are “college men" and in nine 
cases out of ten do not even profess 
to hold the- reins.
It is no wonder, therefore, that 
when these hundred thousand young 
colts find themselves this September 
“turned loose on Main Street” many 
will run wild, smash their college 
course to smithereens, and bo “shot1 
by the college authorities or by the 
homefolks before the first year of 
their great adventure is over.
Incredible as it may seem, most 
colleges are proud of their failures, 
and point to their piles of corpses 
as evidence of their “lTIgli standards. 
That each represents a wrecked col­
lege career and a sorrowing home 
seems never to occur to them. It is 
very hard and very troublesome to 
train such row colts to a prop'er 
use of freedom. It is so much easier 
and such an armor against crij-icism 
to lay the responsibility entirely on 
the colts, shoot the runaways by the 
score, and call the whole murderous 
process a useful, necessary, and prov­
idential elimination of the unfit.
So the slaughter of the innocents 
goes steadily on, the schools holding 
the reins tighter, and the colleges 
abandoning them more completely, 
with every passing year, with such 
disastrous effect that o-f the hundred 
thousand hopeful aspirants who be­
gin their college training this Sep­
tember less than half will survivo 
their sophomore year.
The boy preparing Tor College can­
not reform these unreasonable meth­
ods, but lie can, if he has enough 
brains and backbone, recognize the I 
danger and keep himself out of the 
college graveyard.—1Temple Univer­
sity Weekly.
ROAMIN’S
Hard Luck. Say what you want, 
the out-of-town jinx sure is after Car­
negie. If ever a team deserved to win, 
that team was ours last Saturday. 
And then to lose out on a lucky 
break! Bpt cheer up. Consider that 
W. & J. hns defeated the best teams 
in the country, and in their only tio 
game, that with California last year, 
they outplayed their opponents. Give 
them credit for the heart to stick 
when it looked as if the game was 
lost, and remember, next year is an­
other time.
On the train coming home from 
Washington last Saturday, it was an­
nounced that the first coach was to 
be reserved for the band. The band 
played all afternoon; helped immeas- 
ureably by keeping the team fighting; 
gave their best efforts for Carnegie 
Tech; and what happened? Fully 
half the ban^l had to stand all the 
way into Pittsburgh because some 
students rushed into the first coach, 
and took their seats. School Spirit? 
Well, maybe, but Roamer can't see it.
The cheering at Washington was 
wonderful. It was the first time this 
season that the student body cheered 
like it can, and it was great. Al­
though outnumbered four to one by 
the W. & J. adherents, we had it 
all over them like a tent when it came 
to noise. When we were ahead, they 
hardly cheered at all; a faint murmur 
of “fight” occasionally coming across 
the field. And when they scored the 
touchdown, we were proud to hear 
the Carnegie cheers coming just as 
strong, if not more so, than when 
we were in the lead. Let’s carry the 
good work on at Penn State.
Committee Named 
For Senior Fence
Zeit and Jeffers Handle Point 
System
Several committees were appointed 
by the Student Council last week.
Zelt and Jeffers were appointed to 
assume charge of the Point System 
for the Council. A good start was 
made by the committee in charge last 
year. This committee is to take 
charge and got the System in work­
ing shape as soon as possible. The 
System as passed by the Council last 
year is in effect with the exception 
of the graduation requirement, which 
is to be acted upon by the Executive 
Committee soon. This same blank 
forms as used last year will be passed 
out to the different student managers 
on the campus and the activities of 
the studeuts will be checked up by 
the committee.
Jack Hallam, chairman, Bruce Pow- 
rie and Hugh Sprinkle were named as 
a committee to take up the matter 
of the cost and probable location of 
the Senior Fence with the school 
authorities.
The following men wore appointed 
to assist Zelt in the organization and 
working of the scholastic coaching 
plan—Kreisle, Arts; Brillluvrt, Engi­
neering and Greenlaw, Industries.
Lillian Cowan, Margaret Morrison, 
J. D. Mawhinney, Arts, J. D. Evans, 
Engineering and Roger Marshall, In 
dustries were named as members ol 
the General Freshman Regulations 
Committee.
Dear Roamer:
While looking over the assembly, 
from the Plebe’s point of view, I’ 
could not help looking over the 
piebes at the same time. It was a 
strange thing to notice how inter- 
ested the Piebes were—in the Tartan. 
While Wally Steffen was talking there 
were at least a dozen Piebes looking 
at their papers, rather than listening. 
In my mind, Wally was favoring the 
student body with his talk and the 
least we could do was to pay atten­
tion. Something shoulds be done to 
show the Piebes when and where to 
read the Tartan, and also how to be­
have in Assembly.
This thought brings up another one. 
The Piebes do not know the Alma 
Mater well enough as yet, and further­
more, they move all around during the 
singing of that piece. It should be 
understood that during the singing of 
the Alma Mator, no one should move, 
and everyone should sing.
Thanking you for your space, time, 
and attention, I am
OSWALD til.
Roamer has also noticed Piebes 
reading Tartans during assembly, and 
the practice is hibt confined to the 
Piebes alone. Several upperclassmen 
were reading while Wally was talking. 
Now the tSoplis can take care of the 
Freshmen, but no one can punish an 
upperclassmen for this gross breach 
of etiquette. Tt’s up to thorn to bo 
moro careful in this respect, and give 
'every speaker at least respectful at­
tention.

To promote friendly relations be­
tween the two classes, to assure the 
Piebes that the only desire of the 
'Sophomores is to make them better 
Carnegie men with a full appreciation 
of the distinction of being Carnegie 
men; the Industries Sophomores will 
hold a smoker for the Industries 
Piebes next Friday evening, October 
20, eight-thirty until eleven-thirty in 
the Carnegie Union.
Several entertainers from down­
town will be imported to furnish 
amusement for the event. In addi­
tion, the Tartan Entertainers, the 
seven piece Industries orchestra, will 
furnish some of their peppy music.
Through the generosity of the Soph­
omores, Freshman regulations will be 
lifted to the extent of allowing the 
Piebes to smoke on the campus that 
evening. Undoubtdly all Piebes will 
take full advantage of this boundless 
generosity on the part of the Sophs.
Ted Hughes is the chairman of the 
committee in charge of the smoker. 
The committee has done everything 
possible to insure a good time. Re­
freshments and smokes will be served 
throughout the evening.
The Sophomores of Industries v/ill 
also hold another Tea Dance, Friday, 
October 27, in the Union.

Dear Roamer:
Noticed many Tech • Plobos with 
their dinks at Washington, and It 
looked pretty good. All the W. & J. 
Freshmen had theirs, and our mon 
gave them lots of competition in mat­
ter of looks. Now we cannot force 
the Piebes to wear the caps at out­
side games, but I think it would bo 
good if they would.
SENIOR.
Senior, you’ve got the right idoas. 
Those Scotch caps looked classy, and 
it would show good school spirit to 
wear them at all the games. Up at 
State they have strict regulations, and 
every Freshman up there will bo pres­
ent in a Plebe hat. So let’s ask all 
the Carnegie Plebos who go up there 
to wear their dinks at Penn State 
and show them that they have noth­
ing on us in the matter of S. S. How 
about it, Piebes?
All the stores in Washington were 
closed up during the game last Sat­
urday.
Hard luck, Pitt.

“MARRIAGE OF CONVENIENCE”
PLAYED AT ARTS THEATER
“A Marriage of Convenience: 
comedy in four acts, commencing 
Wednesday, October 11, 1922. Char­
acters :
Comte De Candale..........John Willard
Chevalier De Valclos.. .James Rosloy

Jasmin .............................I-Iarry Morvis
An Officer.....................Josopli Lazarus
A Footman.........................Raleigh Law
Comtesse De Candale.... Janet Mlllis 
Marton............................. Mary Brown
Dumas’ “Marriage of Convenience-,’’ 
was charmingly acted at the Arts 
theater Wednesday evening. Tlie 
decorative and froshy comedy, still 
fresh in many respects,’ was quite ca­
pably directed by Hubert Osborne.
The story concerns the advonturos 
of one amorous Comte! Do Candale, 
connoisseur of feminine charms, and 
his mah'iago with a girl fresh from 
the convent. It sooms that in the 
convent the girl has met a cliovalior 
and promises him that she will never 
fall In love with the husband she In 
being forced to marry, in the end 
she does—and that is the play.
Being exceedingly thin in spots, tho 
play is bolstered up beautifully by 
means of skillful direction. Tho pol­
ish of the gontlemen of tho court 
of Louis, tho elegant Insincerity of 
tho Comtesso Do Candale, tho con­
ceits of hey servant, Marton—all wore 
perfect.
Mary Bi'own, as Marton, was a joy. 
Her finish and poise made her tho 
outstanding feature of tho perform­
ance. Janet Mlllis raado a charming 
Comtosso, both in tho white wig of 
tho Louis, and later with tho bobbed 
hair of the flapper. Miss Mlllis tri­
umphed oven over this. John Wil­
lard mado a dashing Comto, ovor easy 
and solf-possessed. 'I’hls Is one of 
tho best things Mr. Willard has dono.
Tho Chevalier of James Rosloy was 
Tarkingl,on, but delightful. Never fora 
moment was ho ovor sovontoen and 
one assumes, that only tho younger 
brothers wore permitted to visit tho 
convents. George Iioag played Lho 
General broadly, but got everything 
possible out of it. I-iarry Mervis, as 
Jasmin, servant, to the. Comte, was 
good, withal a bit Hebraic.
The set was attractive and well 
lighted, frivolously furnished and un­
substantial looking. Tho large screen 
was especially lovely and looked gen: 
uine. The inner roorn was pleasing 
and one would like to have seen more 
of it. Mr. Wyckoff surpassed him­
self.
“The Marriage of Convenience” 
sets the pace for this season’s the­
atricals. This will be a very success­
ful year if the plays to follow are up 
to the standard of this one. It was 
the smoothest first performance the 
writer has seen in the Arts theater. 
The fact that there wasn’t a hitch 
speaks well for the new technical di­
rector, Mr.- Sabourin.
Mr. Osborne, who staged the play, 
is the author of “Shore Leave,” now 
running in New York with Frances 
Starr and James Rennie.
Retail ReTrin Band is One Feature of 
Football Trip to W.&J.Tho second of the voluntary, non­
sectarian chapel services was held 
Tuesday at noon. Dr. Thomas E. Tho* 
burn of the Christ M. E. Church, made 
an address and conducted tho services. 
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, acting presi­
dent, read tho scripture.
The first of the chapel services un­
der the direction of tho faculty was 
held Tuesday a week and was espe­
cially well attended. A minister from 
some well known church, in and out 
of town will conduct the services each 
Tuesday, and representatives from va­
rious creeds will be choson. Thus, it 
is planned to have tho selection from 
each creed made from tho per cent* 
age of students belonging to that par­
ticular creed.

One of the outstanding featuros of

the praiseworthy work of tho band. 
Little do we realize how much their'

splendid showing. At ten o’clock on.

TEKNON HOLDS FIRST
MEETING OF THIS YEAR
School Is running now. Teknon had 
its first meeting last Thursday even­
ing at tho Shadysido Presbyterian 
Church.
After dinner, Priscilla Allison, Act­
ing President, spoke briefly in con­
nection with.the opening of the club, 
then turned the meeting over to Dr. 
Kerr.
The plan for the first fow months 
is to study India, its political, econ­
omic. and1 religious aspects. There 
can be no doubt as the interest of 
this course under the leadership of 
Dr. Kerr. Anyone who has over come 
into contact with him knows some­
thing of the benefits to bo had from 
anything of this kind.
Many of the old members, as well 
as some of the new, wore present at 
the first meeting, and it is hoped that 
more will be there next week.
CHAPEL AND MAGGY MURPHS
In view of the fact that tho Y. M. 
C. A. and the Y. W. C. A. are the 
organizations 'responsible for the 
chapel exercises which are held every 
week on our campus, it seems a bit 
unjust that both of these bodies 
should not have been consulted in 
regard to the time of mooting.
Last year, chapel services were 
held for the first time at Carnegie 
Tech. They wore promoted by the 
Y. M.- and tho Y. W. Tho sorvlces 
continued under the auspices of those 
two bodies. This year tho services 
are hold at an hour when no Margaret 
Morrison ¡itudent, and few from the 
College of Fine Arts, arc free.
Since Chapel liatt taken ovor by the 
Administration, why should tho ser­
vices be aranged so that one of tho 
two assoclnlllons whicjh promoted 
thorn Is unable to attond? Wo fool 
that this is an oversight on tho part 
of tho Executive Committee which 
should bo brought to tho attention of 
all who aro coneornod. Is there not 
8omo way by which lho prosont 
arrangomont might he cjiangod before 
tho next semester?

phasized that either of these gentle­
men wero willing to help tho student

sonal matters. Mr. I-Iower also ox- 
plained that the advisors were the 
champions of the section and of each 
individual member of the section in 
all matters in which the authorities or 
faculty were concerned. In short, the 
faculty advisors intend and want to 
be the confidants and guides as well 
as friend in need to the fellows of 
their section.

WEDNESDAY, OCTOBER 18, 1922THE CARNEGIE TARTANPAGE THREE
Thiel Pointing For 
Plaid Game Saturday
Greenville Eleven Stronger 
Than Last Year’s Team
Flushed with a clean-cut victory 
over Buffalo University last week, 
the plucky eleven of Theil College is 
coming to Pittsburgh Saturday with 
>.he intention of ¡holding our Red 
beauties to a low score.
And they have a good chance of do­
ing so, too. Thiel had one of the 
surprise elevens of Western Pennsyl­
vania last fall. After a most discour­
aging start, she found her feet and 
•won her last three games hy shut-out 
scores against Susquehanna, Alfred, 
and Juniata. The Carnegie Tech con­
test was the first of the season and 
resulted in a 42—0' victory for the 
Plaid.
Football at the Greenville school 
dates from 1893, but the sport was 
suspended 1902 until 1912. Since then 
Thiel, backed by the citizens of the 
town, has slowly developed the grid­
iron game and is becoming increas­
ingly powerful among teams in her 
class. This development received 
• added impetus with the coming of 
E. W. Pennock, a former coach of 
Peabody High School.
The squad is composed largely of 
men from Greenville High and other 
Western. Pennsylvania prep institut­
ions. Among the veterans are Dufford 
and R. Petty, ends; Roth and Johns, 
tackles; Berkman and Bell, guards: 
'Captain Mitchell, center; Stanton, 
quarterback; Christman and Dozer, 
halfbacks; MdCoy, fullback.
iSome of the promising new men 
include Moore, Madden, Kapp, Downs, 
•Cohen and Smith.
Carnegie should win on Saturday 
but Thiel can be depended upon to 
give, a good fight.

First Quarter
Wash-Jeff was first on the field. A 
young army came out behind Captain 
Wayne Brenkert and the crowd 
roared.
The Tartans in their bright red jer­
seys followed a few seconds later and 
the plaid enthusiasts greeted them 
with a roar equally as great as that 
which greeted Wash-Jeff while the 
band struck up “Dear Old Tech, Car­
negie Tech.’
Greasy Neale and a yellow cap that 
became famous in last year’s Pitt- 
Wash-Jeff game followed Tech out. 
The crowd was impartial and gave the 
red and black mentor a mighty cheer.
Tech won the toss and elected to 
receive the /kick, defending the south 
goal. West kicked off to Anderson 
on the 15 yard line and he ..was 
downed after a five yard gain. Rob­
ertson rounded left end for six yards. 
Lamb shot off right tackle for a first 
down on Wash-Jeff's 37 yard line. 
Robertson received a bad pass on the 
Tech 14 yard line, a loss of 23 yards. 
Robertson skirted right end for 10 
yards. The ball was brought out to 
the center of the field, and Godden 
failed to gain on a double pass. An­
derson punted out off bounds on the 
Wash-Jeff 30 yard line. Brenkert was 
dropped for no gain' at right end. A 
double pass Brenkert to West lost 
four yards. Futhey gained a yard at 
left end. Fu.they was injured when 
tackled. Erickson replaced him. 
Brenkert punted from the .Wash-Jeff 
2S to Anderson on the Tech 41. An­
derson signalled for a fair catch. 
Lamb cut through the center of the 
line for five yards. Lamb again hit 
the line for four more. Newman 
made it a first down on the Wash-Jeff 
48 3rard line. Lamb picked up a yard 
in the line. Robertson gained five 
yards around left end. Lamb cut 
through the center of the line for a 
first down on the Wash-Jeff 35 yard 
line. Wash-Jeff took time out at this 
point. Robertson made three off right 
tackle. Robertson was thrown for a 
two yard loss on right end. On a 
double pass Godden went off left 
tackle for two yards. Anderson punt­
ed over the Wash-Jeff goal line and 
the ball went to the Presidents on 
their own 20 yard line. Kopf was 
thrown for a 3 yard loss. Haddon 
failed to gain at left end. Basista 
also was.; thrown for no gain. Bren­
kert punted to Godden on the Wash- 
Jeff 39 and he returned to the 35 yard 
lino. Lamb got four yards in the line. 
Lamb failed in another crack and 
Tech was penalized five yards for off­
side play. Robertson was thrown for 
a 3 yard loss at left end. Robertson’s 
forward pass was grounded. Ander­
son punted to Erickson on the Wash- 
Jeff 15 yard line and he was downed 
in his tracks. West gained a yard in 
the line.’ Erickson was out of bounds 
on the 22 yard line, circling left end. 
Kopf was injured on the play. He 
stayed in the game. West got away 
for a 10 yard gain, but fumbled as 
he was tackled and Lamb recovered 
for Tech on^the 36 yard line. Lamb 
made three at right end. He got one 
more at right guard. The quarter

ONCE MORE
Has Little Washington been awakened by the echo of the Scottish war 
cry and once more have they seen the irresistible red machine in action. No 
longer does the Red and Black create a feeling of fear in the hearts of 
Flaid followers for the Presidents saw defeat staring them in the face. 
They were forced to stake everything on a series of forward passes and 
Neale took tho chance and won. He was desperate, fighting with his back 
to the wall and he tried the last possible resort to stave off a defeat.
Wally Steffen had a tremeudous task on his hands to mold a team to 
cope with the Red and Black. With three of his men on the bench with 
injuries, he put out a combination which not only was able to handle the 
W. & J. offensive but also to show such-a brilliant attack as to thoroughly 
outclass and outplay them. We’ll soon be calling Wally the “Miracle Man” 
if he continues such performances.
Two more men were hurt in the game on Saturday. “Obib”- Newman 
was kicked in the nose when he made a flying attempt to tackle West on 
his run for a touchdown. However, it is likely that he will be in shape for 
the Thiel game. Jim Anderson sustained an injury to his right shoulder in 
one of the plays but the extent of it caunot be determined until an X-ray 
is taken.
W. &.J. Coach Gives His 
Opinion of Carnegie 
Team After Game
LUCK
Carnegie Tech needs to carry a horseshoe around to these games away 
from home. For three or four seasons, the Tartans have failed to register 
a victory on a foreign field. It seems to be a hoodoo that follows the Plaid 
on such occasions.
At the game on Saturday, one could almost feel it coming on as the 
end of the game approached. W. & J. has an uncanny way of getting the 
breaks or uncorking some kind of a trick play at the last moment. Let's 
try to break it up at State.
AT CINCINNATI
The Tartan harriers will have their first test of the season. Among the 
entries in the Syracuse invitation meet are Yale, Harvard, Cornell, Colgate, 
Syracuse, Pennsylvania and Carnegie Tech, which shows that the Plaid is 
getting into classical company even in the minor sports.
SIDELINE COMMENTS
Here’s something that will bring a pleasureable feeling to Skibo ad­
herents. Wally Steffen has signed a new contract for a period which pre­
sages more crack gridiron- machines in the future.
The Athletic Council at- its last meeting tendered a letter of thanks to 
Colonel Brooks for his services as coach of the tennis team. 1-le has been 
doing this work without remuneration, showing his interest in the advance­
ment of Plaid athletics.

BASKET BALL f
Is looming up in the not far distant future and we have with us this 
year a new coach although he is quite familiar in Carnegie athletic circles. 
Steffen’s able assistant, Bob Waddell, is to handle the Tartan floor team this 
winter. . The schedule as made up so far contains the following: Mitldle-
bury, W. & J., Penn .State, Geneva, West Virginia, Washington and Lee, 
Grove City, Allegheny and Bethany.
GOOFERS
We hear that some of our gridiron stars are taking to golf. Up in the 
country club near Washington some of them tried at teeing off, with caddies 
to chase the ball. Cy Comfort’ decided to stick to kicking the pigskin after 
failing to drive the ball across a road only a short distance away. Mefort 
swung at the ball a half dozen times before lie managed to hit it, while 
Dutch Zelt and some others made some good drives.
“I rank Carnegie Tech ace high 
among the teams in this section.” So 
said Coach Neale, of W. & .1., after 
the game Saturday. The W. & J. 
dressing room was crowded with 
players, coaches, and undergraduates; 
and at one end stood Neale, surround­
ed by a crowd of fellows, all anxious 
to congratulate him on tho game. 
Many of tho players were crying over 
the outcome, the first sectional tie 
under Neale’s regime; and they were 
being cheered up by the undergrads, 
all happy that it had been no worse.
When approached, Neale said, “I 
hardly know what to say. Before I 
went into the game I said that it 
would prove one of the toughest on 
our schedule, and the result certainly 
show's that I was right.”
He admitted that the team played 
up to its usual form but “Tech has a 
fighting team. ’They outfought us all 
the way through. You should have 
beaten Yale. You outfought them the 
same way.” he said.
When asked as to where lie would 
rate Carnegie among the other teams in 
the tri-state section, ne responded 
without hesitation, "Ace high. 1 rank 
Carnegie Tech ace high among tho 
teams in this section.”
While talking -to Steffen, Neale 
said, “I thought I had a good line, 
but it certainly looked ragged today. 
I wish to give you every credit for 
outplaying us all through the game.” 
This from the coach of our oppos­
ing team and one oL’ the keenest 
judges of football in the country, 
speaks volumes for the all around 
play of Carnegie.
A NEW IDEA
W. & J. has organized an auxiliary group of rooters in the form of gram­
mar and high school boys, who, in return for their servicos are admitted to 
the game. Special seats are furnished for these pigmy rooters and they are 
led by some of the Presidents’ regular cheerleaders.
Last Saturday this special section was very effective, tho shrili and high- 
pitched voices of the school boys forming a sharp contrast to the deepor and 
more rounded voices of tho college men.

Team Shows Up Well
The first cross-country trials wero 
staged last Friday afternoon over the 
now course in Schenley Park. About 
thirty men completed the run, finish­
ing on the cinder track down on the 
athletic field. The results were very 
gratifying to Coach Heeler, several 
new men showing up particularly 
well. Captain Greenlaw led the field, 
closely followed by several more. 
The time was rather slow, although 
it is hard to judge anything like that 
due to the change in courses. Among 
the ten men who followed Greenlaw 
were Sampstm, Mendenhall, Bright, 
Hinderer, Tubbs, McKelvie, Care. Fos­
ter and Foller, the first Plebe to fin­
ish.

most crodlt, for It was through (ho 
lino that Lamb wont time and again 
for good gains. Gilbert and Sprinkle 
at guard and tackle made groat holes 
for plays through tholr positions. A1 
Irwin at center proved a lemon on 
tho defensive, often smearing tho op­
posing backs for a 'considerable loss. 
Then we must not forgot thoso two 
ends, Potter and Godden, who carried 
the ball for gains of ten and fifteen 
yards besides keeping the Tartan 
Hanks well protected.
West and Erickson did much of the 
ground gaining for the Presidents 
while Oltz and Wlederquist prevented
harder for our team because of their 
being accustomed to the bridle paths 
of Schenley Park. Nevertheless, tho 
Plaid harriers should make a good 
showing in their first meet.

KÂMPUS KOMMENT
By James K. Matter 
Speaking of friends
Professor J. H. James has develop­
ed a new fuel that may be manufac­
tured by catalytic oxidation from low 
grade petroleum. The methods have 
proved successful in the laboratory 
stage, and give promise of practica­
bility on a commercial scale. The prop­
erties of this new fuel, which is ob­
tained by partial oxidation of petro­
leum, may cause it .to be used indus­
trially in kerosene engines or blend­
ed with gasoline for use in gasoline 
engines.
Y. M. C. A. OPENS CAMPAIGN
SOON FOR MEMBERS
And great men
It's a wonderful thing to have the 
first and know the second
On Saturday a friend took several 
of us to Washington in his car. 
While there we pulled up to a gas sta­
tion for oil. A boy came out to do 
the honors. . As near as we can re-1 n 
member he sported a red and black 
tie over a red shirt with black stripes, 
and he had the W. & J. colors on 
his cap. SGz the boy
“Where you from?”
Somebody told him
The kid ran into the shop with a 
yell. “Oh, Mr. Connors,” he cried, 
“here’s some students from Tech.”
Professors James, Work and I-Iower 
have been appointed as a committee 
to make arrangements for the series 
of three lectures to be given in No­
vember by Dr. Irving Langniuir.
"Pittsburgh as an Industrial Cen­
ter,” by Professors James and Rittman, 
has been reprinted in pamphlet form 
from the September number of the 
"Journal of Industrial and Engineer­
ing Chemistry.”
Dr. Kan-Iclii Tanaka, Ph.D., of the 
Teachers’ College of the Tokyo Im­
perial University, and Yukiyoski 
Koga, professor of Industrial Psoycho- 
ogy at the Nagoya College of Com­
merce of Tokyo, visited Carnegie 
Tech the week of October 9 to get .an 
insight into the various methods used 
in the school. They are making a 
tour of the United States visiting the 
different colleges and universities.
NIGHT CLASSES WILL HAVE
BI-MONTHLY SCHOOL PAPER
Dr. Charters, director of the Re­
search Bureau of Retail Training, 
lectured at the Alabama Technical 
Institute during the past week.
The following is an excerpt from a
(Continued From Page One.) 
relations .with the Institute and the 
members of its faculty.
. “This first number is written large­
ly by the members of our staff. It is 
hoped that you of the night student 
body may be willing to contribute to 
the future issues. We shall be glad 
to receive articles, or letters, or news 
items, and we shall be glad to have 
some of the students accept part of 
the editorial responsibility. We have 
no definite plans for the paper except 
we want it to serve the night students 
in the manner that will.be most help­
ful and acceptable.
“I hope this is going to be a very 
successful year, and I hope that every 
man and woman who is enrolled in 
the evening courses Avill feel that the 
officers and members of the faculty 
are deeply interested in their suc­
cess.”
This paper is being published 
through the Publicity Director’s of­
fice, and will not have a student staff 
as does the Tartan. Contributions 
from the night student body will be 
accepted, as Dr. Baker states. “The 
Slcibo” is being printed in the Depart 
ment of Printing. It will be about 
one-quarter the size of the Tartan 
and will have eight pages.

who remain in Pittsburgh are enter­
tained by the Y. M. C. A. The “Y” 
is host to a big Christmas dinner and 
distributes full membership tickets to 
those who remain over the holiday. 
These membership tickets apply to 
the city Y. M. C. A. and are good for 
the vacation period. Numbered in the 
other activities of the Carnegie Tech 
"Y”are smokers and stags throughout 
the school year; distribution and care 
of the caps and gowns for the iSeniors 
at Commencement; and co-operation 
with the Student Employment Bureau.
This year as well as last the “Y” 
has arranged with Penn Stato for the 
entertainment of the Skibo rooters 
when the Tartan gfidders descend 
upon the gridiron at State College. 
Interfraternity basket ball and base­
ball will also be taken care of by 
the "Y”.
Any organizations with the activ­
ities of the "Y” deserve YOL.R 
SUPPORT. Be ready for the Com­
mittee from October 25 to 27. V. Roy 
is in charge of the College of Fine 
Arts, Rohrbach of Industries, and 
Brillhart of the College of Engineer­
ing. Any amount is-solicited but the 
future success of the Y. M. C. A. at 
Carnegie Tech depends on the amount 
you give. Payment of the full amount 
entitles you not only to membership 
in the Carnegie Branch but to all the 
privileges of the city Y. M. C. A. 
A membership card, secured by a con­
tribution of any amount, gives you 
membership in the Carnegie Tech 
Branch for one year (including the 
summer months) and admits you to 
the social functions of the city Y. M. 
C. A.’s.
Watch the thermometer in the 
Bfcanery. Look for your leader and 
get that membership card when the 
campaign opens on October 25. Sup­
port the "Y” just as faithfully as you 
have supported the scarlet clad grid­
iron heroes and just as you would 
support any other Carnegie organ­
ization, activity or tradition.
GET BEHIND THE "Yp AND 
PUSH THEM OVER THE TOP.
"Give ’em a ten per .cent* discount,” 
sez the boss, coming to the door. "Do 
any of you fellows know Sprinkle? 
What?—you don’t say. Boy, give ’em 
a twenty per cent discount and a full 
measure of oil.”
And then Mark Herr slid into the 
Hall of Fame. “Mr. Connors,’’ he in­
sinuated softly, “I live in' the same 
house with Sprinkle.”
One of the biggest problems of the 
out-of-town alumnus is how to keep 
informed as to the activities of his 
Alma Mater. Of course the news­
papers give him an idea as to the 
work of the athletes, but Is that 
enough? If the graduate is a fra­
ternity’man, he wants to know what 
his brothers are doing 011 the cam­
pus. One of the chief purposes of 
the Thistle is to give this informa­
tion.
Carnegie is to have that new gym­
nasium soon. The Thistle will de­
vote several pages to the plans for 
the new building, giving in addition 
a description of all the ‘features. A 
ibowl is also planned, to take the 
place- of our present field. Thistle 
will give the details.
To be e.xact, Thistle plans to be a 
eally representative Carnegie year 
book. The history of everything that 
has happened or that will have hap­
pened before the book goes to press 
will be given, both by word and by 
picture. The Mardi Gras and the 
Arts Ball, the Junior Prom, and each 
of the other social events will have 
its own section.
What could give the alumnus a 
better Idea of what is going 011 at 
Carnegie? I-Iow could the graduate 
keep in touch with Carnegie In a bet­
ter ’way?
Send in that check now! Make it 
payable to Vincent Roy, Treasurer. 
Mail It to the 1923 Thistle Board, 
Care Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology. The price is $4.50 for resi­
dents of Pittsburgh. Add $.25 if you 
live outside of the city. Thistle will 
send you a receipt immediately.
The proprietor shook his hand fer­
vently. “Bless you, my son, for them 
words. I have a daughter who knows
Mr. Sprinkle------” lie choked with
emotion; “excuse my poor control, 
but what’s a few tears between men. 
Boy, give this gang anything they 
want, and charge ’em nothin’. Wipe 
their engine off, toll ’em the best place 
to eat, and give ’em some of our most 
noble free air.”
And now that W. & J. is taken care 
of .we have coming up In the future 
the Penn Stato game, and the Penn 
State Special train. Price of ticket is 
a modicum over six dollars. For this 
sum you are entitled to.
A free dinner 011 the train if you 
bring it yourself, and the privilege of 
holding your first chop sweetie's hand 
—if you bring her along, as you 
should. Jack Frankin also wlshos us 
to announce that tills train will be 
oqulppod with sun parlors, a maid, a 
valet, a Volstead Bar, a parking sec­
tion for cake eaters; and then there 
will bo other special features.

The Faculty Glee Club will wander 
through the cars In the role of .trou­
badours, singing selections from that 
great tropical opera—"She seeked the 
Shiek 011 the desert, and now the

There will be a ferris wheel for the 
high minded, pogo stiiks for the tem­
peramental, and peanuts for those 
with the price.
IMPRESSIONS OF
LIL WASHINGTON
(Continued From Page One.) 
this year we tied, next year we will 
wallop them.
No need to discuss the game here, 
we all saw it and know the result. 
Will we ever forget the march for the 
first touchdown, the stonewall that 
the Plaid team presented to the Wash- 
Jeff offence, the series of passes that 
W. & J. tried when they had every­
thing to gain and nothing to lose, the 
fluke that gave West the ball, the 
grab that Obie Newman made for him 
as he neared the goal?
Washington was pretty quiet until 
our first special came in and then 
things began to grow lively. The 
Carnegie Tech stands were completely 
filled by two o’clock; by 2:30 the 
whole field was packed with over 
16,000 spectators, 4,000 of them being 
Tech rooters.
Our band was there in uniform; 
we had seven cheerleaders, and a 
crowd that could yell. And there is 
one thing that should have impressed 
everyone about the Plaid supporters. 
They know enough about football to 
keep off the field during the game. 
W. & J. ought to build a fence around 
their playing field so that the. players 
can spend their time playing football 
rather than chasing the crowd off the 
field. The end of the game did not 
end the Carnegie cheering. After the 
game the band led the. parade to the 
B. & O. station in Washington and 
led another through downtown Pitts­
burgh when the train pulled in to 
town. It was hard luck that we 
couldn’t celebrate a victory, but wain 
till next year. We’ll got them then— 
how about it Carnegie?
Prof.: “Wake that fellow up next
to you.”
Student: “Aw, do it yourself—you
put him to sleep.”—Ex.
H. K. Kirk-Patrick will speak on 
the softening influence of a Chinese 
Laundry 011 shirt collar bands, while 
Red Godden has promised to make a 
short address on The Aurora Borealis 
as I Saw It, with eleven W. & J. men 
on my neck.
Were you a real Carnegie Tech 
rooter at the Wash-Jefl' game? The 
majority of the Tartan followers were 
but the writer noticed a few that were 
not. If you answer to the following 
definition of a loyal Carnegie rooter 
you can be satisfied with yourself you 
can be satisfied:
A loyal and enthusiastic rootor at 
the Carnegie-W. & J. game was the 
student who stuck with the crowd in 
the parade before the game and lot 
the people of Little Washington know 
.of the true 'Carnegie spirit; who stood 
on his feet when the team came 011 
the field because he wanted to and 
not because the rest did; who felt‘a 
lump of joy creep into his thvoat as 
the Plaid gridders tore through the 
well coached W. & J. team; who 
yelled till his face burned and his 
throat was raw’because he wanted his 
team to win and not because he had 
money at stake; who never talked un­
sportsmanlike and in the end with the 
score tied, with the greatest gridiron 
game in history a thing of the past, 
returned to Pittsburgh still cheering 
and yelling for those who gave, their 
utmost that the glorious colors of the 
Tartan Plaid be not lowered.
'Shell a student was a real sport and 
a loyal Carnegie Rooter. It is the man 
and woman of this type who has 
placed Carnegie Tech 011 the lofty 
plane which it now occupies. This is 
the type that keeps commercialism 
out of the game and supports foot­
ball for football’s sake.
Wore all Carnegie students of this 
caliber 110 team in the country could 
be victorious over the fighting grid­
ders who play their hardest becauso 
they have Carnegie at heart.

"Newspapers, Religion, and Educa­
tion are the three great elements hi 
American life,” is the opinion of C. C. 
Chao, twenty-year-old Chinese student 
taking post graduate work in metal­
lurgy at Carnegie Tech. "These three 
things have made the greatest, impres­
sion on me since my arrival in tho 
.United States a month ago."
Mr. Chao, along with two hundred 
other Chinese students arrived in San 
Fraueisco 011 the "Nanking.” While 
Mr. Cliao came to Carnegie Tech, and 
is tho sixth Chinese student to attend 
the, local school, the other students 
spread over the country entering va­
rious schools.
"American schools are highly 
thought of in China,” lie said, "and I 
had heard a great deal of Carnegie 
Tech before I decided to come to 
school here. While I wad at Peiyang 
University in Tien Tsin, I talked to 
some of the students who had gone to 
Carnegie. My-homo Is in Sluing Nai 
and my father is in the government 
service.”
Mr. Chao, who speaks English very 
well, as a result of having been in­
structed at Ills Chinese University by. 
an American professor, says that the 
American Mission is very popular in 
China. Americans are well liked. The 
English avo popular in a commercial 
way, while the French are not very 
popular at all.
Mr. Chao Is attending Carnegie 
Tech with the Intention of taking a 
Master’s degree. Then he will work 
in this country for a year or so, ob­
taining practical experience, after 
which I10 will return to his homo in 
China.

WALLY STEFFEN GIVES TALK 
AT LAST GENERAL ASSEMBLY
(Continued From Page One)
It was moved and unanimously 
passed by the assembly tnat the Stu­
dent Council be requested to appoint 
a committee whose duty it should be 
to have the Carnegie Band complete 
ly outfitted in kilts for the coming 
game with State. This will make the 
band very distinctive and representa­
tive of the Scottish customs by which 
our school is known. If such can 
be accomplished It will add much to 
the band’s effectiveness.
Tho attendance at this assembly 
was good. Nearly everyone was there 
and full of pep.
