Committee Lists 
Final Program
Interfraternity Sweepstake 
Preliminaries Replace 
Circus Day
CORONATION THURSDAY
Costumes Will Be in Or­
der For Ball Friday 
Evening
The program for Spring Carnival 
will be similar to that of last year 
cxccpt that Circus Day, which was 
held on Friday morning last year, 
is not included. This event was 
eliminated by the committcc be­
cause of the fact that it could not 
be worked into the program so 
that sufficient time would- be left 
for the intcrfratcrnity sweepstakes. 
The committcc also felt that there 
was not sufficient interest in the 
program to warrant its repetition.
Following is the program as an­
nounced by the committcc:
Thursday Night 
Coronation Ball—9:00 to 1:00. 
Gymn and Union.
Coronation of Campus Queen— 
10:00. In front of Arts School.
Friday Morning 
Sweepstakes Preliminaries—10:30.
Friday Afternoon 
Qualifications for Honoraries— 
2:00. Open Air Theater.
Friday Evening 
Costume Ball—9:00 to 1:00. Gym 
and Union.
Saturday Morning 
Sweepstakes Finals—10:30. 
President’s Review—11:30.

will furnish the music Thursday 
and Friday evenings in the Union 
and the Krushinski Brothers’ or­
chestra will play in the gym both 
nights and Saturday afternoon. 
The committcc has ruled that no 
one will be admitted to the Cos­
tume Ball Friday evening without 
a costume.
Two cups will be awarded for 
the Sweepstakes, one for the win­
ner and one for the best designed 
pushmobilc.
Aeronauticals To 
Take Scheduled 
Trips Next Year
Five-Day Inspection Tours 
Given Same Status 
As Classes
A change in the cirriculuin of the 
aeronautical engineering- course to in­
clude four major inspection trips is 
being planned for next year. Several 
of these trips, usually about five days 
in length, have been conductcd by 
the present upper classmen enrolled 
in aeronautics, but thej' have always 
been optional.
The plan for the future schedule, 
as outlined by Professor Blaisddll, is 
to require the upper classmen to take 
, a ccrtain number of these trips by 
giving them the same status as regu­
larly scheduled classscs. The sopho­
mores would make one trip, the 
juniors one, and the seniors two.
The chief reason for requiring trips 
outside Pittsburgh is that the major 
places of interest in the aeronautical 
world are at centers other than this 
city, and the benefits derived from 
visits to the important factories and 
research laboratories are quite worth 
the time and expense involved.
A group of a dozen seniors and 
juniors recently made a five days’ 
tour, including trips to the Goodyear 
Zepplin plant at Akron, O.; the Waco 
factory at Troy, O., two days at 
the Detroit Air Show, and trips to 
both the Curtiss plant and the Con­
solidated Aircraft plant at Buffalo, 
N. Y. Study of the features of the 
designs of the aircraft made and ex­
hibited at these places was the main 
program while plant layout and opera­
tion proved also of major interest. 
One additional feature of such ex­
tensive inspection trips is to provide 
a method of aiding the men in the 
department to make, contacts with 
the various companies which will 
probably become their future em­
ployers.
The itenary of another trip con­
ductcd last fall by the present senior 
aeronauticals included trips to Lang­
ley Field, Virginia, and the various 
aircraft companies loeated at Wash­
ington, Philadelphia and New York. 
A goodly number of factories arc 
located in this Eastern district as 
well as several important research 
laboratories.

Program to Include Weld­
ing of Chain and Calls

The Qualification Day program 
will be held in the open-air theater 
Friday, May 9, at 2:00 o’clock. As 
an important and traditional ccre- 
monjr of Carnegie, all students are 
especially urged to attend the cxcr- 
ciscs. The number of students 
present at Call Day and their atti­
tude toward it will largely deter­
mine whether next year’s Spring 
Carnival will includc all of Friday 
or will begin only after the day's 
classes arc over.
The event will begin with a 
Freshman procession led by the 
Kiltie Band. A formal Clan Re­
ception for the Class of 1934 will 
follow a number of selections by the 
Band and the Men’s and Women’s

the program will be the traditional 
welding, of the chain, after -which 
the May Queen, Elizabeth Steele, 
will present the awards cups. Bill 
Bryant, president of Dragons, will 
then read the calls .of the honorary 
societies. The singing of the Alma 
Mater will conclude the ceremonies

the Cut as.is customary.
CORONATION TO BE ON 
STEPS OF ARTS SCHOOL
Theme of Pageant Taken 
From Wagnerian 
Opera
The coronation of the campus 
queen will take place on the steps 
of Arts School. The formal cere­
mony will includc an act in which 
the entire court of the queen. will 
participate, and will, culminate in 
the crowning of the Queen by a 
Prince Charming. The theme of 
the ceremony is taken from the 
Wagnerian opera, "Siefried.” In 
order for the Princc' to win the 
Queen, he must first overcome a 
¦fierce fire. The ladies-in-waiting 
will then dcscend from a mountain 
which will be built ten feet above 
the coronation platform. Five of 
these Airmen arc to do an appro­
priate dance.
The platform for this ceremony 
will be built by the Construction 
committee. James Traa, president 
of the senior class, College of In­
dustries, will have complete charge 
of all construction work in the 
Spring Carnival. The w'ork includes 
the coronation and orchestra plat­
forms. Inasmuch as the Country 
Fair has not been included in this 
year’s Spring Carnival, much con­
struction work will be eliminated. 
Mr. Traa is a member of Phi Kap­
pa Psi, Alpha Tau, Student Council, 
and Y. M. C. A. cabinet. The com­
mittee also includes Leonard 
Schnupp and Fred Kissel.

their annual boatride and dance on 
Friday evening, May 15 aboard the 
steamer Julia Belle Swain. The 
boat will leave the dock at Smith- 
field and Water streets at 8 o’clock

and will return at 1 a. m.
Art Giles and his popular seven 
piece orhccstra, which is now .play­
ing at the Golden Pheasant, Clever 
land, has been secured for the 
evening.
The Julia Belle Swain has recent­
ly been repainted and redecorated.

FRESHMEN WILL GIVE 
ANNUAL DANCE FRIDAY
Town Tattlers to Furnish 
Music—Admission 
to Be $1.50
Plans arc well under way for the 
Freshman ¦ Dance which is to be 
held in the Union on May 1, from 
9 to 12 o’clock. The committcc 
has engaged the Town Tattlers, -a 
well known orchestra on the cam­
pus.
The committee: Mary Husband, 
Martha Toerge, Bradley Edclblut, 
and Emmanuel Schugar, wishes to 
announce that the dancc is open to 
everyone. Popular opinion has been 
that the dance is exclusively for 
freshman, but it is only being 
sponsored by the Class of '34.
Novel features of the dancc will 
be the programs, decorations; and 
the lights. The programs prom­
ise to be of a kind which is en­
tirely new on the campus, and the 
decorations and light’s will tend to 
add much atmosphere to the occa­
sion. The pricc of admission is 
$1.50 per couple. . However, it is 
understood that each girl and boy 
who makes a date through the 
Date Bureau will buy his own 
ticket.
According to the chairman of 
the Date Bureau, Mary Husband, 
this feature of the dance is work­
ing slowly but extremely satisfac­
torily. Up to the present time ap­
plicants for dates have found it 
quite easy to secure one through 
the bureau. All that the applicant 
must do is to fill out a blank stat­
ing his name, address, height, 
weight, color of hair, and - color of 
eyes; the bureau arranges the de­
tails.
“Macbeth” Proves To 
Be Most Popular 
Presentation 0! Year
Judging from the demand for 
tickets, the production of Shakes­
peare’s “Macbeth” by the Drama 
Department is proving to be the 
most popular presentation of the 
year. From April 23 to May 6 
there will be fifteen regular per­
formances, besides a number of 
others for special groups. Plans 
have been made to accommodate 
not only those on campus but 
groups from the high schools in 
the district. The Pittsburgh Per­
sonnel Association and The Vet­
erans of Foreign Wars arc having, 
theater parties at various evening 
performances. The presentation of 
"Macbeth” and "Twelfth Night” 
starring Jane Cowl, are the only 
Shakespearian plays that have come 
to Pittsburgh, and it is interesting 
to note how v/ell they arc rcccivcd.
In addition to celebrating 
Shakespeare’s birthday with the 
playing of Macbeth; Pauline Baucr- 
smith in Elizabethan dress placed 
a wreath, on the statue of Shakes­
peare in front of Carnegie Museum 
on Thursday, April 23, at 11 a. m., 
exactly 376 years after his birth in 
Stratford-on-Avon, England. She 
then recited a poem written by 
Colonel Samuel Harden Church 
for -the occasion.

Pi Delta Epsilon 
Asks For Change 
In Activities Fee
Suggests Raise in Student 
Fees to Include 
Thistle
Wilfred Worland, of the day 
school, and E. E. McDonald, of the 
night school, represented Carnegie 
at the convention of Pi Delta Ep-: 
silon, national journalistic frater­
nity, at Cincinnati, on April 16, 17, 
and 18. They return to tell us 
that Carnegie Tech has one of the 
lowest student activities fee in the 
country. They also report that 
the organization of our publications 
is in excellent shape.
As a rcsqlt of the convention, Pi 
Delta Epsilon has presented a reso­
lution to the student council to 
raise the student activities fee so 
that it will include a Thistle. If 
the resolution is passed, the Thistle 
will be included in the activities fee. 
Also if this is passed, the financial 
position of the Thistle will be so 
improved that it will be made possi­
ble for every student to have an 
individual picturc in it.
Albert Atwood, well known writ­
er and member of the Saturday 
Evening Post staff, addressed the 
convention at its formal banquet, 
Friday evening, April 17. He was 
made an honorary member of Pi 
Delta Epsilon at that time. The 
next convention will be held at 
George Washington University in 
Washington, D. C. next year. The 
arrangements are to be in the 
charge of Dean Henry Ward, na­
tional secretary of the organization, 
who is a member of the faculty at

National DeMolay 
Fraternity Accepts 
Phi Delta Tau
Delta Sigma Lambda Will 
Install Iota Chapter 
Next Month
Phi Delta Tau fraternity has just 
been acccptcd as Iota chapter of 
Delta Sigma Lambda, DeMolay na­
tional. Word has been received 
from the national headquarters in 
Chicago that the petition of the 
Carnegie local was acccptcd by all 
the chapters.
Phi Delta Tau, whose house is 
at 807 -South Millvalc avenue, is 
the -youngest local on the campus, 
having been recognized by. the In­
tcrfratcrnity Council only last May. 
It has pledged and initiated only 
DeMolays and now has twenty-one 
active members. The strength and 
rapid growth of Phi Delta Tau in- 
flucnced the acceptance of its peti­
tion by the DeMolay national. Its 
officers at present includc H. L. B 
Stuart, President; J. F. Bcamcr, 
Vice President; E. L. Stcncz, Sec­
retary; and J. R. Carson, Treasurer.
Although Delta Sigma Lambda 
has no official connection with the 
DeMolay organization, its member­
ship is entirely DeMolay. Delta 
Sigma Lambda was founded at the 
University of California and has 
been gradually spreading eastward. 
Its nearest chaptcr is now at 
Purdue.
The installation of Iota Chaptcr. 
of Delta Sigma Lambda «will be 
held early in May. It is cxpectcd 
that W. F. Crummcr, the Grand 
President and a member of the 
Chaptcr at the University of 
Illinois, will be one of the install­
ing officers. An open house is 
being planned, to which all frater­
nity men will be" invited.
Delta Sigma Lambda is alrcr h- 
represented on the campus by Mr. 
L. C. Meskimen,

intcrfratcrnity track meet. A list of 
these rules is being sent to each 
fraternity this week. The fraternities 
will draw for places in three heats 
to be held Friday of Campus Week, 
the first two fraternities in cach heat 
qualifying for places in the final 
competition, to be held the follow 
ing Saturday morning.
The council will hold its next

Phi Mu Alpha Plans 
Special Program For 
Tea Dance April 30
Phi Mu Alpha, national men’s musi­
cal ‘ honorary, will try to do away 
with the continuous cutting at tea 
dances by experimenting with a new 
plan at' a dance to be held in the 
Unioii next Thursday. Much dis­
satisfaction With the present method 
of selecting partners has caused the 
committee in charge of the affair to 
try the plan, .which" will work as 
follows:
All of the danccl; \$ill 'be num­
bered and the fellows arc to secure 
dances in advance. There is to be 
no cutting except during several spe­
cial danccs, which will be announc­
ed by the orchestra. The dances will 
be short enough so that a dozen or 
more can be played within the two 
hours scheduled for dancing. The 
committee hopes that this new plan 
for tea: dances will prove popufar with 
the students. They state that this 
arrangement will permit an oppor­
tunity for couples to come together.
The Phi Mu Alpha Sinfonians will 
furnish the music. The orchestra is 
made up of musicians from the 
honorary and the music department. 
Most of them play in popular radio 
broadcasting orchestras in the city.
This tea-dance will be the last one 
before Campus Week. The dance will 
be from 4 to 6 o’clock with usual 
admission charge of 35 cents for men 
and 25 cents for women.

FLANNELS ARE IN ORDER
Affairs is Open to Students 
In All Classes of 
Four Schools
The combined Senior ball of all 
four colleges will have Kay Kyscr 
playing for it at the Schenley Hotel 
this Friday night -from 9 until 2 
o’clock. It was announced last week 
that Hal Kemp arid his orchestra 
would /play at the ball, but through 
no fault of the committee in charge 
word was rcccivcd that Hal Kemp 
could not play bccausc of a'contract 
with the New Yorker Hotel begin­
ning May 1.
Kay Kyscr is now concluding a 
trip in which he visited such schools 
as Ohio State, Ohio Wcslyan and 
Purdue. Immediately after, his visit t 
here he will open in the Palace 
Theater in Cleveland. Kyscr’s band 
is not unknown in Pittsburgh, he hav­
ing played at the Nixon restaurant 
the past fall. He has played over 
the National Broadcasting chain and 
is rccognizcd as having an orchestra 
among the best in the East.
An attempt was made to secure a 
country club for the ball, as in 
former years, but since some of the 
clubs have n’ot as yet opened and 
sincc those that have opened require 
a dinner dancc in order to secure the 
club, Hotel Schenley was chosen, 
where a large crowd can be ac­

Eighteen Thousand 
Throng Campus 
At Open Night
Pittsburghers and Parents 
Attend 25th Annual 
Exhibition
A record crowd of fifteen to 
eighteen thousand visitors is esti­
mated to haye attended Carnegie's 
Annual Exhibition last Friday, 
when parents of freshmen and oth­
er Pittsburghers were giveri the 
opportunity to see the school and 
exhibits of another year’s work.
At Dr. Baker's welcome to fresh­
man parents in the afternoon, hi 
urged that they have their chil< 
dren get in closer touch with theit 
teachers. Many of the Parents’ 
Day visitors ate in the Commons 
cafeteria, which was crowded to 
capacity.
The retreat parade of the Kiltie 
Band and the. R. O. T. C. went 
off promptly and impressively.
Many of the laboratories at­
tracted interest. The electrical de­
partment pul on its customary
demonstration of enormous sparks 
and provided phonograph music in 
Machinery hall. The printing de­
partment had a model of an early 
printing press • with pressmen in 
costume. Linotype slugs of visi­
tors’ names were made. The tin 
shop was giving away stampings 
of ashtrays. In Margaret Morri­
son, a demonstration of typing to 
music drew attention, as did the 
fashion parade. The psychology 
department used visitor^' as test,
subjects and 'proved that blue and
yellow make gray. It is estimated
that the Department.''of Household 
Economics made and distributed 
between four and five thousand
cookies.
A three-cylinder pusher plane on 
the quadrangle in front of Ma­
chinery hall bore a sign announc­
ing that May 16 would be Car­
negie Tech day at Bettis Field.

SPORTS AND ALUMNI NEWS
COACH HALFERTY'S TRACKMEN pulled the lid clcan 
off the Plaid track season by defeating the Western Reserve 
Red Cats, 83 to 52, in the Bowl last Saturday. The well bal­anced Skibo aggregation accounted for 10- of the 15 first places, 
and it is thought that more records would have been lowered 
had the track been in better condition.From the spectators’ point of view the one mile run and 
the 100 and 220 yard dashes gave the biggest thrills. In the 
long distance event Ras Ramsey put on a fine performance. He lead the field for the entire five laps, crossing the finish line 
with ten yards to spare. In the century run Nease was nosed 
out of first place by Hagesfeld, of Western Reserve, who came 
from behind in the final ten yards. However, Nease gained revenge in the 220 with a substantial lead of a dozen yards at 
the tape.Jesse Price took his usual first place in the two mile jaunt. His stride and five points seem to go hand in hand. Captain 
Barg Ray Barger climbed the heights of 11 feet inches with 
the aid of his vaulting pole.The field men have acquired the habit of throwing things 
around with no mean consequence. The former hammer throw 
record took to its wings when Armentrout dislodged the 16 
pounds for 135 feet one inch.The mere thought of ten hurdles before him does little to 
keep Tom Coulter from running away with the top honors. On Saturday he came within one-tenth of a second of the School 
record for the tall timbers, and his strides over the low sticks, we understand, were within one-fifth of a second of the world’s 
record. This was exceptionally good for a slow track. Earlier 
in the week Coulter visited the Penn Relays with gratifying 
results. Tom hurdled down the. 400 meter track with a lone runner in front of him, his efforts being good for a worthwhile second place in this event.* * * * * ,
SOFTBALL TEAMS will engage in a dozen games this week, providing the weather is favorable. Sure, winners in this 
activity are a mystery until the 24 teams have simmered down to a digestible quantity. The Renegades and the Delt’s returned 
the winners of last week’s games, but the losers, Henderson and 
Alpha Sigma Phi, have one more chance to redeem themselves. * * * * *
THE PLEBE TRACK TEAM kept pace with the Varsity in the track and field events of Saturday by downing the Turtle 
Creek Union High School with a score of 66^ to 41^. The quartet of Biggin, Schell, Haley and Edelblut totaled 45 points 
during the afternoon in the various track and field events.
Wednesday the Yearlings will play host to Schenley Hfigh 
trackers in the Bowl, and the following Saturday they will 
journey to Clarion for a meet with the State Teachers’ College of that city.

THE COURT MEN OF THE PI K. A. HOUSE finished up with a strong 31 to 1G win over the Kappn Sig's, of Pitt, in 
tile semi-finals of the intra-mural competition. Stankey and 
Johns proved to be the undoing of the Panther representatives, scoring two dozen points between them. A fast game was played 
with the PI K. A’s leading 0 to 5 at the half. The Pitt team was held under control for the remainder of the game, and the points piled up accordingly.

Printing News
“Significances of Printing Pro­
cesses'” was the subject of an ad­
dress given to the Department of 
Printing on April 27 by I-Iarry L. 
Gage of New York City. Mr. 
Gage . was the first head of the 
Department of Printing and took 
a very active part in the activities 
on the Carnegie “Tech” campus 
during the early years of the insti­
tution. In recent years he has been 
connected with the Bartlett Orr 
Press of New York City, one of 
the leading printing firms in greater 
New York, as its secretary. His 
work in typographic design has at­
tracted a great dial of attention 
and was responsible for his ap­
pointment some time ago to the 
post of director of Typography 
for the Mergenthaler Linotype 
Company of Brooklyn.
A special feature of the meeting 
at which Mr. Gage lectured was 
the announcement of the lecturer's 
election as an honorary member 
of Pi Alpha Delta, the fraternity 
recently established by the Depart­
ment of Printing. At the same 
time Fred J. Hartman, directbr of 
Education of the United Typothetae 
of America, who was formerly con­
nected with Carnegie as secretary 
to the president and acting head 
of the Department of Printing, 
was awarded a similar honor. John 
H. Lord, junior, and Harold Cad­
mus, Jr., sophomore, were called to 
membership in the organization.
LOST
On Monday morning, April 11, a 
platinum pin about 2^ inches long 
was lost either in the Margaret 
Morrison College or between that 
building and Forbes street on 
Woodlawn avenue. Any one hav­
ing any information about the pin, 
please notify Miss Minnie Moore 
in Margaret Morrison.
Members of the senior classes in 
the Department of Printing had the 
privilege of hearing an address, on 
April 23, by D. P. Porterfield, direc­
tor of the Department of Marketing 
of the United Typothetae of America. 
Mr. Porterfield had a rich experience 
in the fièld of advertising prior to 
his appointment to (lis important po­
sition with the national trade asso­
ciation of master printers. The mem­
bers of the class in Printint Plant 
Management had, in advance, pre­
pared a number of questions bearing 
on practical marketing problems which 
were discussed by Mr. Porterfield, 
who drew 'upon his experience for 
illustrations to present marketing 
trends and practices.
Another speaker who has recently 
addressed classes in the Printing De­
partment was Roy Mtunma, Com­
mercial Engineering, 1917, of the 
Service Department of Ailing & Cory 
Co. of Pittsburgh, who discussed the 
major problems that confront the 
buyer of printing papers.

Plebe Trackmen 
Win Easily Over Turtle Creek High
The Plcbc trackstcrs continued 
thfcir winning (not yet a streak), 
this time at the expense of Turtle 
Creek Union High. Union pre­
sented a much more formidable ar­
ray of track and field talent than 
did' Carnegie's opponents of the 
preceding week, and as a result 
the meet was much more interest­
ing and not nearly so much of a 
walk-away as the 66 2/3 to 41 1/3 
score shows. Biggin and Haley 
tied for “high point man,” each 
scoring 11 points. Biggin took 
first in the hurdles and high jump 
and third in the broad. Haley's 
points came from a first in the 
broad jump and seconds in the 100 
and high jump, The Plcbcs arc 
still weak in the dashes, although 
the performances of the high 
school sprinter, Elstrodt, were good 
enough to win many a freshman 
race.- The field events, with the 
exception of the shot, were won by 
Plebes. The pole vaultcrs, Hills 
and Levine, arc getting higher 
cach meet and much is expected 
of them in the future. I-Iiltz again 
won the javelin throw and Fors­
man was much in evidence in the 
shot and discus.
This week the Plcbcs have two 
meets, the first with Schenley 
I-Iigji, Wednesday, in' the Bowl. 
On Saturday the team goes to 
Clarion Pa., to compete with Clar­
ion State Teachers’ College. This 
is the Plebes’ only trip and they 
are anxious to make a good show­
ing away from home. The sum­

the softball competition when the 
score of teams finish knocking out 
homers and popping flics to the 
pilchcr.
A week ago the Renegades gained 
a 12 to 10 decision over the Alpha 
Sigma Phi’s, In future ganics, teams 
had belter beware of Bravin, Rene­
gade pitcher, who doled out a 
single walk and also swatted a four 
bagger. The game proceeded in a 
sec-saw fashion with the Alpha 
Sig.’s trailing in the final seventh 
inning.
The Dclt's . managed to end up 
with a 9 to 6 victory over the Hen­
derson Hall team. The winner’s swat- 
fcst in the third inning gave a healthy 
margin that was not overcome. 
Webster played the stellar role, hit­
ting a home run with the bases 
loaded.
During a meeting of the man­
agers last week, the administrative 
board of five members was elected. 
It includes Ey’th, Bogan, Baushkc,

Netmeii To Open Season 
With Bison Meet At 
Bethany Wednesday
In spite of the bad weather en­
countered during the last week, 
Coach Hoover’s varsity netstcrs arc 
in fairly good shape for their 
initial meet at Bethany Wednesday. 
The squad has rounded into shape 
faster than anticipated arid ^ victory 
is expected.
The strength of the Bethany team 
is not: known, but in their only meet 
this year the Bisons were slaughtered 
by Pitt 7-0, which indicates that they 
can’t be much over average.
“Stew” Dueger is slated to handle 
the No. 1 position for the Tartans,' 
and if early workouts mean anything, 
his opponent is in for a very busy 
evening. Captain Morris will take the 
No. 2 assignment, and McCloskcy, 
Bcrghanc, and Gropes arc also ex­
pected lo start.
The Bethany meet wifi be fol­
lowed by nu engagement with Du> 
qiiesnc 1*. rid ay on the liill-toppcrs' 
courts.
While the varsity is out invading 
foreign ' courts, the local net fans 
will not want for entertainment, as 
the freshmen have two home games, 
scheduled for the week. Shadysidc 
visits the Carnegie courts on Wcd- 
nsday, followed by the Duqucsnc 
freshmen oil Friday. No definite line! 
uy has been announced as yet, but it 
is cxpcctcd that Hartig, former 
Michigan freshman star, will be in 
No. 1 position. In addition to the 
home and home engagements with 
Shadysidc and Duquesnc, the plebe? 
have dual engagements with- Crafton’. 
Kiski and W. and J. A meet with1

Carnegie’s varsity and freshman 
track and field squads opened their 
regular schedules Saturday with im­
pressive victories. The varsity had 
little trouble downing the Red Cats 
from Western Reserve takjng eleven 
first places to five for the Cleve­
landers, to score an 83-52 victory. 
The freshmen took'the measure of 
Turtle Creek Union High School by | 
a 66 2/3—41 1/3 margin.
The Tartan athletes record smash­
ing habits were maintained by 
Armentrout when he hurled the 
hammer 135 feet and 1 inch to break 
the existing mark.
The performances of several Car­
negie runners was outstanding. Ram­
sey once more turned in a sparkling 
race to win the mile in the fast time 
of 4:42.5 and Jess Pricc the other 
diminutive distance man copped the 
two mile event in fine style getting 
under eleven minutes for the first 
time this season. Tom Coulter was 
the only dual winner in the track 
events capturing botll hurdle events 
in easy fashion. George Nease turned 
in his fastest 220 of the year and 
also took a sccond in the 100.

mer- while Reserve took all the

The Social Committcc has made 
plans for a golf tournament to be 
held at the Shannopin Country 
Club on Monday afternoon, May 
4, at 1:30' o'clock. If your golf 
is . not in a .class with , that of 
Bobby Jones, do not be discour­
aged, for there is to be a kickcrs’ 
handicap, which means that ama­
teurs have as much chancc to win 
prizes as par shooters.
From now on during the sum­

main open at night, the club hours 
being from 11 o’clock in the morn­
ing to 5 o’clock in the evening, 
sire to make use of tlie club rooms

by leaving with h'cr their names.
About two weeks ago a lettef 
was sent to every national frater­
nity on the campus containing a 
special offer to have the various 
fraternities represented by their 
coat of arms on the walls of the 
club. To dale the Thcta Xi, 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon fraternities 
have responded to this offer, and 
promises have been made by sev­
eral of the other fraternities. If 
the offer mentioned in this letter 
meets with . your approval, we 
should like to have your frater­
nity’s check soon.
The alumni of the Sigma Nu 
Fraternity will hold a dinner 
meeting at the club on Friday eve­
ning, May 1, 1931.
One of our recent non-resident

Dear Mr. Ovcrcnd:
I am enclosing a check for $5 
as non-resident membership dues 
for the Carnegie Tcch Club for 
the year 1931. ' Although at the 
present time far away from Pitts­

time this summer and would like 
to have a loo,k in.
I was very much pleased when 
I road about the organization of 
this club in the February edition 
of the '‘Carnegie Alumnus,” and I 
feel firmly convinced that it will 
enjoy great succcss and prosperity.

significant victory by defeating the

Both Tcch teams had things 
their own way most of the time. 
Wclch Hall was somewhat handi­

suffering from an attack of measles. 
Neither Wclch Hall nor Kappa.Nu 
were able to spore until the bc- 
inning of the sccond , quarter. 
After the opening ¦ of the sccond 
stanza, the game was a one-sided 
affair..
The Pi K. A.’s displayed a fast 
brand of ball which: entirely baffled 
the Kappa Sigs, and after the 
opening of the sccond half, there 
was little doubt as to which team 
would finish on top.
This is the first time for quite

Due to the fact that there arc

happen to be Carnegie Tcch grad­

a single one. There is a colony 
here in Moscow of over two thou­

Chicago Clan 
Quite a number of Chicago Car- 
negians gathered around the lunch­
con board at Field’s Grill on Fri­
day, April seventeenth. What was 
missing in quantity Avas adequately 
made up in quality. Mrs. Field 
did nobly with the viands as well 
as giving us the use of a private 
dining room.
A new member of the clan was 
introduced: D. O. Gifford, ’30, 6405 
Yale avenue, Chicago, who is in 
the printing industry.
G. L. Tillbrook was in town last 
week and had hoped to be with us 
at lunchcon. He was in Chicago 
drumming up business but as soon 
as Ccrmak was clccted mayor, his 
incrcasp of business was assured 
and he left for New York to take 
care of the mayoral condition 
there. We are sorry wc missed 
you,. Tilly.
Wc heard that "Doc” Marks and 
“Bert” Munhall were in town with 
the Pittsburgh- Pirates. Attempts 
to get into communication with 
them were unsuccessful so they 
missed a good meal. Maybe they 
did not like the treatment our Cubs 
•were giving the Pirates.
, The next lunchcon is planned for 
Friday, May 22nd, 12 o’clock noon 
at Field’s Grill. At the meeting 
wc arc going to discuss summer 
activities and a golf tournament.

Johnstown Clan 
The Johnstown Clan will hold 
one of its usual monthly parties 
on Friday, May 13. One of the 
interesting features of this meet­

NIGHT STUDENTS.Œbe Carnegie JMaib
INTER-NIGHT COLLEGE 
DANCE—MAY 9
Well, did you ever sec anything 
like it? The crowd of visitors wc 
had at the annual exhibition was 
beyond all expectation. . It didn’t 
matter what place you visited, 
there was S. R. O. Those who 
came out for the big show cer­
tainly saw something worth while. 
Tech is surely a great institution 
and all those connected with it are 
equally great (except the Idle 
Night Student), but then he doesn't 
count. What we want here seems 
to be workers, so I guess I am 
out of luck. Anyhow, this year’s 
exhibition will go down in history 
as being the greatest so far.
I made it a point to see the 
whole show, so was there on time 
for once. As I glanced up the 
cut, I could see in the distance a 
mass of color slowly taking shape. 
There was a rhythm in the move­
ment and cach component part 
swung bade and forth in unison. 
Nearer and nearer the forms carric. 
They, were none other than our 
beloved Kiltie Band. Raptures and 
thrills were uppermost as these 
fine musicians marched, their kilts 
swaying in harmony with the tem­
po of the music. It was a sight 
long to be remembered. They 
were as one in their movements.
Following the band, came the 
students who compose the R. O. 
T. C. This gave a martial ap­
pearance to the whole program. 
They' paraded in a truly military 
fashion. At the command, “pass in 
review,” the whole formation filed 
past in a manner worthy of com­
mendation. Retreat was sounded, 
the flag lowered, and the military 
pageant was finally brought to a 
close.
As the band marched off in the 
distance they presented a very 
Striking picture. However, I 
couldn't help noticing those cute 
little spats, white if you please, all 
bobbing up and down—reminded me 
of a field full of bunnies hopping 
aloijg. Funny how I should think 
of rabbits in connection with the 
Kiltie Band, but I did.
Now that the exhibition is over, 
the next thing tb look forward to 
is the Campus Carnival. This big 
show is going to be a big success, 
at least if my presence means any­
thing it will, as I will be there 
with tlie proverbial “bells on” slo­
gan. Yes, I am told, the night stu­
dents can attend the affair, 
about all that remains is for us 
to purchase the tags and then be
on hand on the 7th, 8th and 9th
of May, for that is when the gala
time will be held.
I notice the Night Student Coun­
cil will hold a dancc around this 
time, so I suppose they will ar­
range their schedule to fit in with 
the activities of the day group. 
There certainly is great co-opcra- 
tion 'between these two groups, 
Wonder why—well, I guess it is 
because they all work in har­
mony. There is nothing like a 
spirit of this kind to make for suc­
cess. I’ll support a platform of 
this kind, even if it is made of 
rubber and bounces back at you.
By the time this column will be 
read we will have experienced the 
daylight saving time again. Funny 
to go to night school during the 
day, but that is what it is like 
when we have the advanced time. 
Wouldn't it be fine if they would 
advance the time four or five 
hours, then, we would be going all 
the time to day school, and the 
day school would have nothing on 
us.
NIGHT STUDENT COUNCIL 
ELECTS PRESIDENT
At the April meeting of the 
Night Student Council, Mr. James 
J. Lcindcckcr was clcctcd presi­
dent. He will assume office next 
fall when the 1931-32 term begins.
Mr. Lcindccker is a student in 
the Night College of Fine Arts, 
and is registered in the Depart­
ment of Painting and Decorating. 
He has spent seven years on the 
campus at night. During all this 
time, Mr. Lcindcckcr has aided and
supported the Night Student Coun­
cil in all the projects which have 
been undertaken. This year, in 
addition to being vice president of 
the Night College of Fine Arts, he 
was night editor of the 1931 This­
tle, and has made a very fine 
showing f*or the night section in 
the college annual. He is a mem­
ber of Nu Sigma Alpha fraternity.
The Plaid wishes to take this 
occasion to congratulate Mr. Lcin- 
decker upon his recent election to 
officc. He has all the qualifica­
tions of a successful leader and the j 
Council, by electing him to this 
high office, is assured that another 
successful year is ahead of them.
CAMPUS CARNIVAL
Tags for the Campus Carnival j 
to be held May 7 to May 9 will' 
be available tb night students dur­
ing the week. As has been the 
custom of the last few years, night 
students will be given the privilege 
of attending this carnival, and it 
is expected that a number of night 
students will desire to avail them­
selves of this opportunity ' to at­
tend the festivities and merry mak­
ing which i^an annual event eager­
ly awaited by the student body.

At the annual spring dance spon­
sored by Nu Sigma Alpha fraternity, 
held on April 18, a call was made to 
the night students whom the fra­
ternity wished to honor at . this time 
as a reward for their activities on 
the campus. The night students who 
received the call are F. P. Collins, 
J. J. Slagle, C. B. Cobun, A. J.

PUPPET
All the night salesmen who have 
been selling Puppet should make 
returns for the various issues dur­
ing this week in order that the 
accounts can be closed. Your co­
operation will be appreciated in 
cleaning up this activity.
The Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology "open house” or exhibition 
night, held last Friday evening, is 
still a major attraction in Pitts­
burgh judging from the thousands 
of visitors who flocked to the cam­
pus to see the students at work 
and to inspect the various shops, 
laboratories, studios, etc. Hundreds 
of parents of the day freshmen 
were the guests of the School for 
the day and seemed to enjoy the 
interesting .sights abo.ut the campus 
as much as their sons and daugh­
ters did' last September.
The R. O. T. C. and Kiltie band 
opened the evening program, with a 
retreat parade bn the campus after 
which the band gave a concert in 
the gymnasium auditorium. Every 
department in each of the four col­
leges had its particular part to play 
in the affairs of the evening. The 
masonry school of the department 
of building construction had a very 
unique display. Each year this 
department has something new to 
offer. In the past years the houses 
which were constructed w'ithin the 
building caused the visitors to won­
der how they, would be moved out­
side. But this year the-setting is 
an outside one.
The printing school in Industries 
is about the most visited depart­
ment in that building. Here we 
see the journey of the metal from 
the time it is moulded into type, 
composed into lines and pages, 
locked onto the printing press, 
printed on the paper, cleaned and 
returned to the foundry where it 
is again melted up. The processes 
by which all colors of the rainbow 
are produced on a printed sheet 
from only four colors of ink were 
clearly shown. The boys in the 
linotype room had lots of fun in 
setting up the visitors’ names on 
slugs and then handing tjiem the 
slug while it was still quite hot. 
One fellow at this job seemed to 
be collecting as many telephone 
numbers as he did names.
Many odd and unusual experi­
ments were being performed in 
Engineering Iiall where the labora­
tories were generally filled with 
curious people. Tha mine in the

basement of this building is always 
an attraction for it helps to bring 
out the point that Carnigic is quite 
a—shall wc call it “versatile school” 
—for you know there is a coursc 
in aeronautics taught at Carnegie 
and the students go forth to serve 
the wbrld from the clouds to the 
bowels of the earth.
Machinery Hall had many dis­
plays of electrical work and me­
chanics for the curious people who 
entered that building. The massive 
engines in the basement were a 
source of amazement to those who 
had never seen anything as large. 
One man that wc observed had a 
heck of a time getting away. His 
little son set up a terrible rumpus 
by crying and pulling on papa's 
coat tail. Little junior was point­
ing to a big something with a 
thirty-foot flywheel and yelling, 
“Daddy, I want one of them toys 
right away!” Junior got it, but it 
was not a toy.
The program by the Departments 
of Music and Drama, offered ,jn 
the little theater, was enjoyed by 
two packed houses where the S. R. 
O. sign would have been super­
fluous, for there wasn’t any. The 
architects were hard at work but 
always had the time to answer any 
questions that were put to them by 
the curious public. The painting 
and decorating students had several 
exhibits of their work. The sculp­
turing school, the jewelry shop and 
the pottery room all had interest­
ing displays that were enjoyed by 
the visitors.
Margaret Morrison Carnegie Col­
lege was packed all evening for 
some unknown reason. Possibly 
giving something away that we did 
not know about. The big attrac­
tion at that school was the style 
show by the students. All the 
work of the show was done by 
students and from reports by one 
who knows, it would make the 
style show of a large department 
store take a back seat.
It was an evening well spent to 
travel about the campus and ob-

The Night Student Council In­
ter-Night College Dancc will be 
held Saturday evening, May 9, in 
the auditorium of the men’s gym­
nasium. This function is the final 
affair on the social calendar of 
the night students and brings to a 
close one of the most successful 
social seasons enjoyed by the 
Night Student Council.
The Inter-Night College Dancc 
is the night students’ contribution 
to the Spring Carnival and comes 
as a climax to that thrcc-day va- 
ation. Practically the same situa­
tion existed last year at Spring 
Carnival time and the two groups, 
day and night, co-operated in 
every way to make the entire pro­
gram a success. The same spirit 
prevailed this year and \yith the cx- 
pcriencc of last spring- to help 
them, the various committees 
should provide us with a program 
that will live in our mchiorics for 
some time to coinc.
The orchestra foe the dance has 
not been selected, but there will 
be a choice between three of the 
most outstanding organizations 
that have appeared on the campus 
rcccnt years. Not much more 
can be said at this time except 
that the dancc will be a typical 
Night Student Council Dancc and 
you know what that means. Get 
your ticket from one of the sales­
men in your class or department. 
Assessment $1 per couplc. Only 
one week of school left, but if you 
fail to get a ticket in that time, 
be around anyhow. The exams 
will be over (?) and your class­
mates, like yourself, will be feel­
ing free and want to break loose, 
so be on hand for the final good 
time of the year.

NU SIGMA ALPHA HOLDS 
SUCCESSFUL DANCE
Nu Sigma Alphh, the night hon­
orary fraternity, on the Campus held 
its annual dancc on Saturday April 
IS and oncc more proved that th|s 
group of energetic night students 
knows how to successfully conduct 
affairs.
The capacity of the' Union was 
taxed by the large attendance, danc­
ing to the music of the Town Tat­
tlers Orchestra. The hall was dccor- 
;itcd in red and black, the colors of 
the fraternity and presented a very 
striking appcarancc. Another touch 
of color was given to the affair when 
cach member of the organization wore 
the fraternity flower, a red carnation.
Professor and Mrs. Kirkpatrick 
were present as guests and ipatrbns 
of the fraternity.
The annual call of pledges was 
made during the evening which 
furnished the high spot for those 
present. S.

finish their courscs this year, and 
will be a very nice souvenir of the 
1931 graduating class. Only suffi­
cient booklets to fill orders will be 
secured, so that all those students 
who wish copies should be sure to 
place their orders promptly.
For the past several years the 
Carnegie Institute of Technology has 
been offering supplementary terms 
during the summer evenings to night 
students and the response has been 
very gratifying. The night students 
iirc enabled to accomplish several 
things with this added term. It may 
be that there is a conflict in a regu­
lar schedule at night so by attending 
the supplementary session a student 
is able to straighten out a difficulty. 
Or it may be that there is a small 
demand for a course during the regu­
lar term and in order to secure the 
necessary number of registrants, and 
by deferring the time for the course, 
enough students will be interested in 
a certain coursc to justify giving it 
at the summer term.
Whatever may be the reason the 
supplementary term .and courscs arc 
given, they arc ccrtainly well worth 
considering and a large number of 
indents have signified their inten­
tions of registering for one of the 
subjects' given. A complete schedule 
is printed on this page and the 
night students who arc interested 
should look over the list carefully 
and decide which one of the subjects 
best fits their needs and then regis­
ter for the coursc. Registration for 
these courscs will be held during the 
week of April 27 to May 1, be­
tween 7 and 9 and on Monday, May 
I, between 6:15 and 7:15 in the 
Registrar's Office.
BAD AIR
A recent meeting of the Ameri­
can Society of Heating and Venti­
lating Engineers discussed the pos­
sibilities of correcting the smoke 
and dust nuisance that Pittsburgh 
and every other industrial town 
contend with unnecessarily. True, 
much has been done to eliminate 
this deplorably careless and waste­
ful condition, but unfortunately1, 
much remains to be done.
The chief concern of the Engi­
neers now seems to be educating 
the general public in the use of air 
conditioning devices in the home 
as well as in theaters, clubs and 
other public places. This plan of 
installing conditioning devices 
would, on the authority of many 
leading physicians, dispense with a 
large percentage of the common 
colds that extract such a great toll 
of discomfort and loss of time 
throughout every community.
It has been shown in many ex­
perimental ways that the efficiency 
of a person working in an atmos­
phere of pure and renewed air is 
considerably higher than the effi­
ciency of the same person under 
the opposite conditions. With an 
incentive of increased efficiency, 
better health, and more comforta­
ble homes to attract the public, it 
would seem that the Engineers will 
eventually be successful in their 
attempts. McG.
PIPE WELDING
One of the well known manu­
facturers of steel products has re­
cently announced the installation of 
equipment necessary to the produc­
tion of their newest and most unique 
process in pipe manufacturer. The 
new system disregards the old
methods of lap—and butt—welding, 
and replaces tiicm instead with a 
spiral weld.
The spiral welding of pipe is en­
tirely new, and is evidently regarded 
as a very practical process, consider­
ing the fact that seven companies 
have applied for, and obtained,
licenses to manufacture pipe in this 
mam\cr. The most desirable feature 
of the method is the long lengths 
that can be fabricated, forty foot 
standard lengths being manufactured 
with present equipment.
Ease of laying and lightness of 
weight arc also looked upon as high­
ly desirable features of the new
pipe, and it’s use will probably be­
come general in pipe line work, 
where the increased lengths will 
obviate many of the joints that were 
formerly necessary. The lessening of 
the numbers of joints per mile will 
provide the users with an excellent 
means of cutting their line welding 
costs and labor charges by enabling 
more lineal feet per day to be laid.
The various steel companies arc 
highly interested in this and several 
other new developments that have 
been brought out recently, and the 
rivalry between them is becoming 
keener in an attempt to produce bet­
ter products at a rcduccd cost in an 
effort to swing the various industries 
to the use of their improved prod­
ucts. While this is primarlv highly 
beneficial to the purse of industry, 
it must also be remembered that it 
is providing many of the young fel­
lows that have just started their 
careers an opportunity to make a 
name for themselves by discovering 
these new processes that were long 
buried under orthodox methods of 
manufacturing. McG.

STEPPING INTO A MODERN WORLD
The long arm of the telephone 
operator — made longer
How to extend the operator’s range five­
fold? There’s an example of the prob­
lems put up to a telephone engineer.
This was part of a study in stepping 
up the speed of scrvice to distant points. 
“Long Distance” used to relay your call 
to one or more other operators. Now 
she herself reaches the city you arc call­
ing, 30 or 300 or 3000 miles away.
Result: in five years the average time 
needed to complete a long-distance'con- 
nection has been cut from 7 minutes to 
less than 2 minutes.
In this industry even long approved 
methods are never considered b6yond 
improvement:. For men of the right 
aptitude, that viewpoint is a stimulating 
challenge.

More and better equipped club-rooms.Better seating accommodations for students at .athletic

the present fee to aid student publications.
Senior Ball
This year’.s Senior Ball committee. has encountered more difficulties perhaps, than any. committee in recent years has 
been, called upon to face. With the. country clubs-unavailable 
due to lack of available dancing space the committee-was forced 
to hold the affair at the Hotel Schenley. This move was op­
posed by several members of the senior class, but it was later realized that, those in charge had done their best, and were 
forced by circumstances to schedule the affair at the place they 
did.
Now another obstacle has come before the committee. It was announced in last week’s Tartan that Hal Kemp was en­
gaged to play for the affair but, due to other arrangements with the National Broadcasting Company, he was unable to accept 
the date. After much trouble, the committee finally secured the 
well-known Kay Kyser to .play for tlie affair.
Mr. Kyser has a good orchestra. The class of 1931 has 
never sponsored a dance which failed financially. The com' 
mittee has given its best, and now, the Tartan urges all the seniors to support the dance and make it a financial and social success.
Activities Fees
At the recent convention of Pi Delta Epsilon at was learned 
by the Carnegie delegates that this school has one of the lowest activities fees in the country. The average fee was around $20 
but nearly every school included a copy of the year book, to­gether with the other benefits covered by the fee’
The plan of raising the second semester fee enough to cover the cost of the year book is very feasible, and if adopted 
at Carnegie, would :rcact to the best interests of everyone con­
cerned. It would enable the staff to produce a much better book, it would eliminate the pesky salesmen, and an increased 
circulation rate would be excellent advertising for the school. 
The financial failure of th? Thistle has been the one weak spot 
in an otherwise splendid system of conducting student activities and it is time something constructive was done to relieve this situation.
Student Council has been investigating the problem for 
some time and will, no doubt, soon make a recommendation to 
the Executive Board, which will follow the suggestions sub­mitted by Pi Delta Epsilon several weeks ago. There has been 
sonic slight objection by the Administration to an increased 
fee, but it must be remembered that the school nearly doubled 
its tuition four years ago and no decrease in registration figures was noted. All phases of the situation have been carefully 
studied by both the journalistic honorary and Student Council 
and the Tartan assures the Executive Board that any recom­mendation presented will not be a hasty decision, but will be the outcome of much serious thought.
Whatever the plan, it will be formulated by students, it will contain what the students seem necessary for the promotion of their activities and the Executive Board would do well to approve it.
NEWMAN CLUB
Plans are almost completed for the 
annual spring dance which will be 
given by the Newman Club of Pitts­
burgh. The affair will be held in the 
Knights of Columbus ballroom at 
Fifth and Bellefield avenues in the 
latter part of May. A. J. Eichen- 
laub of the Commercial Engineer­
ing department of Carnegie Tech 
has been appointed chairman of the 
dance committee. Other members of 
the committee who have been ap­
pointed to assist him include Ethel 
Mae Suehr of the University of 
Pittsburgh, Charles J3roskey of Du- 
quesne University, and, Gertrude 
Novak of Carnegie Tech.
The dance this year will take the 
place of the spring formal since the
formal was given during the winter 
season. The affair is not limited to 
members of the Newman Club but is 
open to- all students of Duquesne, 
Pitt, and Carnegie who may de­
sire to attend. Novel decorations will 
be provided for the event and a 
prominent local orchestra will play. 
Tickets are $2.50 per couple.
CWENS
In the future Cwens will have an 
advisory board, consisting of the 
out-going president, andl two- other 
members to l^e chosen by the presi­
dent. The advisory board for next 
year will be Gloria Kloos, Hazel 
Gough, and Betty Preller.

Howdy, Yo’ All!
Congratulations, Betty! The new 
Queen of the May has been selected, 
photographed, interviewed, and will 
reign next week in all her regal 
splendor. King Foote, who in his 
spare time serves as Court. Jester, 
and Prince Sutch have been distri­
buting cigars as a gesture of achieve­
ment ever since the election Friday. 
All those who have not received 
their, nickel smoke may do so by see­
ing Mr. Foote or Mr. Sutch anytime 
before they run out (the cigars).
The runners-up in the election, who 
will serve as Attendants to the 
Queen on Coronation evening are 
Polly Dixon, of dear old Minne­
apolis, and Pauline Bauersmith, of 
Pittsburgh and the dear old Drama 
Department. The vote cast was large 
for Carnegie elections, showing the 
interest in the election. Arts School 
proved our predictions not so hot- by 
landsliding their Pauline into third 
place 'to rank along with the two 
Margaret Morrison girls. When bet­
ter predictions arc made, we will not 
make them.
The successful candidates have been 
obtaining as much attention from the 
public press as a movie star or a 
hatchet murderess. Everything Betty 
Steele has said since the election has 
been written down for future refer­
ence. If she doesn’t say much for 
the next couple of days, it’s because 
she’s afraid it will appear in print. 
So far she hasn’t said anything to 
¿ive her away on any particular mat­
ter. Wc will listen carcfully, how­
ever.
Kay Kyser, formerly of the Nixon 
and points West, will supply the 
music for the Senior Bailers Friday 
night. Hal Kemp has undertaken a 
hotel engagement starting May i. 
He would have given up the engage­
ment, of course, for such an Jivent 
as the Carnegie Tech Senior Ball, 
but what's the use in being selfish? 
Kay Kyser is good, anyway, coming 
as he docs from Cleveland, the cen­
ter of good orchestras and good 
times. He specializes in collegiate 
music, if you understand us. His is 
the famous “Fraternity Blues/' You 
will perhaps remember him as the 
blond gentleman zuho tried the dif­
ficult job of leading. Tcch’s cheer­
ing section at a football game here 
last fall, while his orchestra was 
appearing at the Nixon.
The Ball is the final big dance of 
the year outside of the May Festival 
dances next week. It is the last 
official social act of the Class of 
1931. It is too bad that the dance 
can’t be closed to seniors only. Per­
haps some day Carnegie Tech will 
be able to hold closed class dances 
besides the Women’s Prom. Anyway, 
this will be your last chance to sec 
the impressive figures of Marvin 
(The Magnificent) Fox, Bill Bryant, 
Dal Ritchey, Dale Knousc, and John 
Dreshar as Handlers of the Situation.
The bigger they are, the harder 
they fall! Our faculty, ever striving 
for good English and perfect arth- 
metic among the students, errs badly 
and publicly. The information board 
in the Administration Building, erect­
ed for use during the Exhibition, 
held three grave mistakes. In the list­
ing of students by states, the words 
Missouri and Minnesota were mis­
spelled. In an addition of figures, a 
mistake of 100 was made. Quick, 
Watson, the Intelligence Test!

SWAN SONG
This is the'twenty-eighth column 
which the Public Nuisance has 
written; it is the twenty-fifth which 
the Tartan has printed. The P. N. 
wants to assure his readers that he 
has always had a colflmn ready 
for them; somewhat in the spirit 
of'the-defunct New York World— 
that come what may the copy must 
be ready. It is as near as he 
comes to .possessing .the instincts 
of classical newspaper tradition. Of 
the three times his column was 
omitted, lie regrets only one—an 
article entitled “Poison Ivy House,” 
describing medieval conditions in 
the women’s dormitories and offer­
ing some constructive suggestions; 
this diatribe was deemed better im­
printed after some faculty supervi­
sion. The other two omissions 
were caused, by the exigencies of 
newspaper make-up. With the edi­
torial board or business managers, 
the P. N. has no quarrel; lie sim­
ply . wanted his readers to know 
the fault was not his and that lie 
has ricvcf*“forsaken them.
A new board is coming in; it is 
fitting that the Public Nuisance 
should cease functioning when the 
old staff goes out. He has been 
both pleased and grieved by the 
acceptance awarded his column; 
pleased that it has been read so 
widely to judge by the campus 
whispers; grieved that its accept­
ance has been so apathetic. Origi­
nally intended to perforin a thought 
and idea stimulating function at 
Carnegie, the column has met with 
dismal failure except twice; and 
each of these times the Public 
Nuisance was forced to step rather 
strongly on a specific group’s tender 
corns before lie could get. any re­
action whatever.
The first of these was “The So­
cial Service Menace” , which called 
forth a /mild storm of damnation 
from those “who still wear frilled 
underwear.” T o, them, the P. N. 
replies that he has no* fight with 
criticism is of the deb dilettantes, 
who, most trained women will 
agree, arc a distinct hindrance and

nuisance to successful social Serv­
ice work.
To the staff of the "Pornographic 
Puppet,” the Public Screwloosc of­
fers no apologies but only his sin- 
ccrcst thanks. Its staff was the 
only group which offered the P. N. 
anything real in the way of criti­
cism. He was glad to sec his 
many faults, especially those of too 
big words and too involved sen­
tences, so remarkably exhibited iif 
the recent parody. The P. N. il 
he were only able would simplify 
his diction so that even the staff 
of the Puppet could understand it, 
but he has a mental quirk which 
makes his writing hopelessly en­
tangled. He regrets, however, that 
he was unable to accept the Pup­
pet's kind letter of invitation, 'to' 
submit copy to their precious’ pages. 
But the ]?. N. knows rather defi­
nitely that lie .cannot write humor 
or poetry (why not include prose 
as well, the Puppeteers may add) 
and therefore desisted in helping 
to swell the heavy waste basket of 
the Puppet editorial suites, (sic!)
As. he stated in his introductory 
column, the P. N. did not care so 
much whether lie were right or 
wrong, but chiefly whether he were 
interesting and could open campus 
eyes to things they ordinarily were 
blind to. He realizes lie must have 
been dry . at times, but his choice 
of subjects was. limited, and his. 
faculty and' editorial taboos were 
many. He regrets < that lie must 
still remain anonymous but certain 
trusts and promises demand it.
In conclusion, the P. N. can say 
that it has been a good year, per­
haps the best of his rather check­
ered collegiate career. He has 
made many valued and pleasant 
acquaintances as a direct result of

his last Public Nuisance, lie bids 
to all of you the best of luck— 
and good-by!
