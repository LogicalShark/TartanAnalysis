Volume 67 — Number 28Wednesday, May 8, 1968Changes in Re; Pre-Scheduling
For the past two years, a num­
ber of students have suggested 
changes in the registration pro­
cedure. Most of these suggestions 
have stemmed from complaints 
that students have made with re­
gard to the sectioning problem 
under the present registration sys­
tem. Accordingly, a new regis­
tration system will be put into 
operations for September 1968. A 
part of this procedure must take 
place before the end of the present 
semester.
A most important first step in 
the new registration system is the 
pre-scheduling of all undergradu­
ate students and all day graduate 
students. Specifically, the objec­
tives of pre-scheduling will be to 
give the departments information 
regarding which courses students 
intend to register for in September 
1968. In order to accomplish this 
pre-scheduling, it is necessary 
that each student arrange an inter­
view with a representative of his 
major department. Pre-scheduling 
conferences must be completed by 
the end of the semester. It is sug­
gested that you make contact with 
your department head no later 
than Wednesday, May 8, in order 
to arrange a pre-scheduling inter­
view with a representative of your 
department.
1. Students be required to pre-
¡¡station: Bull Pen
schedule for all courses they de­
sire to take in the ensuing semes­
ter. Pre-scheduling for the 1968 
Fall registration will be held be­
fore May 17. The students will 
pre-schedule with the aid of an 
advisor. They will use a master 
course schedule complete with 
class meeting times to assist in 
course selection. New and trans­
fer students will not be required 
to pre-schedule. Pre-scheduled stu­
dents will be permitted to report 
for registration at an early hour. 
This will assure them of the best 
possible chance of registering for 
the courses they have selected. 
This procedure is for information 
only and does not represent the 
final schedule. The department 
will arrange for additional or 
fewer sections, instructors, or 
courses as indicated to be necess­
ary by the pre-scheduling data. 
The departments will establish up­
per limits to the number of stu­
dents per section.
2. Students will report to depart­
ment areas on the formal dates set 
for registration to finalize sched­
ules. The time of the students’ 
arrival in the department area will 
be predetermined. The Registrar 
will establish the reporting prior­
ities based on a formula to be de­
veloped. Pre-scheduling, major 
courses of study, class, rank are 
(Continued on Page S)Other Channels For Social Action
This week’s TARTAN outlines 
the goals of the Martin Luther 
King, Jr. Scholarship Fund which 
seeks to increase the opportunities 
for high-risk students from under- 
priviledged areas to find an edu­
cation at CMU and, at the same 
time, to broaden the makeup of 
the student body t o include 
groups, such as Negroes, who 
have been heretofore excluded. 
The fund drive represents the 
chance for Carnegie students to 
demonstrate their concern for the 
welfare of others, to dispel the 
criticism of apathy which has been 
so frequently leveled at this cam­
pus.
But while the fund drive pre­
sents an opportunity for students 
to express their concern and con 
structivly contribute to the needs 
of future high-risk students, it 
must not be forgotten that other 
channels for action exist through 
which students can work to elim­
inate discrimination on this cam­
pus and elsewhere in Pittsburgh 
and to provide opportunities for 
the underpriveledged. A contri­
bution must not be used as an ex­
cuse for doing nothing more. Other 
organizations aimed at social ac­
tion exist on this campus and need 
the time and efforts of many. 
These other channels include:
Chose. Clearing House for Open 
Occupancy Selection. Volunteers 
are needed for securing informa­
tion about available apartments 
and for testing the openness of 
apartments to “nonwhites" in Oak­
land, Squirrel Hill, Shadyside.

Freshman Orientation In Planning Stage 
All-Encompassing Activities Emphasized
By Susan Stockton
Plans are being made for the 
Freshman Orientation Program of 
the class of ‘72. Through a lessen­
ing of the mechanical aspects of 
orienting incoming students, the 
Orientation Committee hopes to 
encourage students to become a 
part of the University more quick­
ly and less painfully. The Fresh­
men will be welcomed by enthus­
iastic counselors who intend to 
close the gap between upperclass­
men and Freshmen. Dinners and 
informal gatherings are planned 
to provide the Freshmen with an 
opportunity to create a rapport 
between their fellow Freshmen and 
the rest of the campus. A new 
emphasis is to be placed upon 
group participation and interaction 
between commuters and dorm re­
sidents. Commuters and dorm stu­
dents active on campus will serve 
as counselors to interest Freshmen 
in inter-college activities. The Com 
muters, in particular will be en­
couraged to become a part of cam­
pus life and to make their col­
lege years as full as possible.
Comprising the Orientation Com­
mittee are the Chairmen, Joe 
Duckworth and Jim Figura; Sec­
retary, Susie Plaks; and Treasurer, 
Jim Neumeister. Bob Harbage and 
Joanne Schneider, as the Acad­
emic Coordinators, will be respon­
sible for the President’s Reception, 
the Student Reception and Con­
vocation. Social Coordinators John 
Hanchulak and Pat Moser will 
plan the evening activities, includ­
ing entertainment to allow Fresh­
men to mix among upperclassmen 
and other Freshmen. Rather than 
the usual dull orientation lecture, 
a known speaker will discuss enter­
taining and stimulating subjects. 
John Fisler is responsible for the 
variety show to be given in co­
operation with Scotch ‘n’ soda.
The Activities Committee, head­
ed by Jeff Sheldon and Larry Daw­
son. will handle the Activities 
Fair for the Freshmen. On Pro­
duction and Registration are Tom 
McGuire and Barbara Wander, 
who will help the Freshmen per­
form these necessities smoothly
Carnegie Dames

INFORMAL • REFRESHMENTS
and without confusion. Peggy 
North and Randy Wright, respon­
sible for Faculty Liaison, will as­
sure cooperation between faculty 
and students in welcoming incom­
ing Freshmen and provide oppor­
tunities for Freshmen to ques­
tion the faculty. Freshmen Book­
lets, including a pamphlet with 
Freshmen names and pictures will 
be handled by Stewart Flam and 
Fran Presser. In charge of Alumni, 
who will lead tours and discus­
sions with Freshmen, are Bob 
Black and Peggy Herre.
Tentatively, the schedule for 
Freshmen Orientation, September 
13-17, will be as follows:
September 13 - Beginning at 
12:30. there will be the Dean’s 
Convocation, followed by a recep­
tion, the President’s Reception, and 
informal tours. The day will cul­
minate with meetings with coun­
selors and the President’s Convo­
cation in the evening. A coffee 
house will be open most evenings.
September 14 - A variety show, 
possibly including the Guys and 
Dolls cast, will be offered along 
with an underground film.
September 15 - A picnic will be 
held on the I.M. field, in hopes 
of motivating as many students 
as possible to interact and meet 
with one another.
September 16 - The Activities 
Fair will be held to acquaint. 
Freshmen with clubs and organi­
zations on campus and to encour­
age the Freshmen to join them.
Sepbember 17 - Registration.
According to the tentative plans, 
the Orientation Program of Sep­
tember , 1968, will not put an 
emphasis upon mixers and dances, 
but rather on more all-encompas­
sing activities. At present, there 
will be no classes held or uninfor­
mative books assigned for Fresh­
men to read. Through cooperation 
between faculty, administration 
and the Orientation Committee, a 
program designed to interest both 
commuters and dorm residents will 
be provided. Final plans for the 
program are to be made by June 
or the first of July.

New Frat House 
Necessary to Whom?
Editor. Igh Ie;pe-D
I just finished reading the com­
munications between the Men’s 
Dorm Council and President 
Stever and was moved so that I 
felt it necessary to write this let­
ter. I consider myself an impar­
tial observer, because a change of 
major and a finite bank account 
are causing me to transfer to a 
“less distinctive” university next 
fall.
To those who may not be fami­
liar with the situation, I present 
a summary, to wit: the Men's 
Dorm Council wrote a letter to 
President Stever urging a reallo­
cation of funds received through 
the “Fund for Distintion" to pro­
vide new dorms for non fraterni­
ty undergraduate men. President 
Stever shot back a reply one 
month later stating that the $1.-
300.000 requested by the Men’s 
Dorm Council had already been 
allocated to the clearly necessary 
(?) task of building new fraterni­
ty houses for SN. TX and KS.
None of President Stever’s ra­
tionalizations convinced me of 
the priority of the fraternity pro­
ject over the construction of new 
dorms for the men. It is hard for 
me to see how any clear-thinking 
person could come up with such 
an absurd proposal.
In the first place, this univer­
sity is one of the few in the coun­
try that provides the fraternities 
with administration owned and 
controlled housing. In most cases, 
the fraternities own their own 
houses, which are usually paid 
for through alumni funds and 
or fund - raising projects of the 
brothers themselves.
Secondly, the three fraterni­
ties now living in the older houses 
(SN, TX and KS) are perfectly 
content in their present quarters. 
In the words of one TX brother. 
“We would just as soon live in 
this house for the next 50 years!"
I have spoken with brothers from 
the other two fraternities and 
have been told the same thing in 
all cases.
At least two of the fraternities 
involved have bank accounts 
which have been accumulating 
for the sole purpose of rebuilding 
the house, when and if it becomes 
necessary.

Many Thanks Due 
To Volume ’68 Staff
Editor. Igh Ie;pe-D
The presentation of Spring Car­
nival always takes a great amount 
of planning and work by many 
people. Indeed it is not possible 
to please everyone at once, but 
this year's Carnival staff seemed 
to come pretty close.
I'd like to thank all the mem­
bers of the Volume ‘68 Commit­
tee which has been hard at work 
since last October: During the 
course of the year we picked up 
an excellent program staff; I of­
fer thanks to Peggy North. Barb 
Hicks. Pat Caro. Connie Mc- 
George. Bernie Dobrowski. Jo­
anne Schneider, and Harvey 
Gillis.
Thanks also to Dr. and Mrs. 
Stever. Tim McFeely. WRCT. the 
Ae;-h­Sh Ihbg-Sbecf the Ie;pe-f 
Visual Aids. Campus Security. 
Ernie Holt, and all event judges. 
Special thanks to Ginnv Cannon. 
Les Hough (and his truck). Dick 
Immekus. Randy Wright. Bill 
Benthall. and their patient dates 
for giving so much time during 
this past weekend.
Sincerely.

King Scholarship- 
No Race Restriction
Editor. Igh Ie;pe-D
Many have asked. “Why should 
Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. 
Scholarships be reserved exclu­
sively for Negroes?" The fact is 
that no such restriction is impos­
ed.
A restrictive covenant of this 
form would be inconsistent with 
the spirit of Dr. King’s life; 
friend of all the people, this lead­
er was shot down on the eve of 
his Poor People's Campaign.
To restrict the scholarship to 
members on one race would be 
inconsistent with this Nobel Lau­
reate's dream “. . . that my four 
children will one day be judged 
not by the color of their skin but 
by the content of their character."
However, it is appropriately 
specified that the funds shall be 
administered by the University 
in a manner that will best contri­
bute to the achievement of a more 
integrated campus. Since our un­
dergraduate student body is now 
99 per cent white, the implica­
tions of this mandate for the im­
mediate future are obvious.

TheT echT endency- 
Leaping Backwards
Editor. Igh Ie;pe-D
Several things have occured 
during the past week which 
should be of note to the student 
body as a whole, whether they 
feel they are affected or not.
In the minutes of the Academ­
ic Affairs Committee, a short 
paragraph stated that no informa­
tion pertaining to either projects 
under consideration for next 
meeting or actions in progress 
would be released in the min­
utes.
Now, the Ie;pe- has been re­
ceiving the minutes of the Aca­
demic Affairs Committee and has 
been printing them weekly. If one 
observed closely, there was a cor­
relations between editorial ma­
terial and the committee's min­
utes.
Consequently, I suppose, the 
Powers That Be decided that it 
was. and would continue to be. 
dangerous to print the minutes 
for all to see.
This is about a 500 yard leap 
backwards. Everyone gripes about 
the lack of communications. At 
the same time, the management 
of this combination Institute of 
Higher Training—Floating Bridge 
Game—Self Perpetuating Prestige 
Machine prides itself on its will­
ingness to communicate and its 
openness to the students.
Lies. All lies. If not. then let 
us see the minutes of this and 
other committees once again . . . 
regularly.
Speaking of committees, which 
leads us to the subject of the 
Black Community, the manage­
ment recently decided to open a 
Community Service Office on this 
campus. The committee will al­
legedly act to coordinate student 
volunteers and social service pro­
jects.
There are myriad of arguments 
against this plan. First, any black 
man from the purportedly mod­
erate to the out-and-out kill the 
Honkies type — will say with lit­
tle or no hesitation that about the

No Communication 
In Fine Arts Dept*
,R- PgyygmaSt ac d y-nn-e c-Sn

Dear Dr. Stever. »
I am concerned about an as­
pect of the expansion program 
which appears to me both to per­
petuate a major flaw in the Uni­
versities Fine Arts College as it 
presently stands, and also hinders 
rather than promotes long range 
growth. I am referring specifical­
ly to the new building to house 
the theater and architecture de­
partments.
A major failing in the CMU 
College of Fine Arts is a lack of 
inter-communication between the 
departments. This is a time of fu­
sion and synthesis within the 
arts: painting is becoming in­
creasingly theatrical, theater is 
tending to include painting and 
sculpture, painting and sculpture 
are moving together, and the tra­
ditional bond between drama and 
music is receiving new life in 
several forms. There is. however, 
almost no interlinking between 
various departments. Not only is 
there a lack of awareness of what 
is done in one department by the 
others, but taking of courses out­
side of one's department seems to 
be discouraged rather than en­
couraged.
Although housing all the de­
partments in the same structure 
should facilitate inter-communi- 
cation. this arrangement is no 
longer possible for lack of space. 
But why. when building a new 
structure, should two of the least 
interacting fields be housed to­
gether? Why not put the two per­
forming arts, theater and music, 
together, and leave architecture 
with its closer kin. painting, sculp­
ture and graphics? If a division 
must be made this appears to be 
a more desirable one.
The drama department is ex­
panding its training into the areas 
of musical comedy: the music de­
partment is sponsoring an increas-

No More Respect 
For Frats At CMU
Editor. The Tartan:
The events surrounding sweep­
stakes competition during this 
year’s Spring Carnival mark one 
of the lowest points to which the 
CMU “fraternity system" has vet 
fallen. The disqualification of the 
two new buggies of Sigma Nu be­
cause a friend of one of the broth­
ers—admittedly outside the fra­
ternity-tightened eight nuts on 
the wheels of each buggy before 
the race can only be described 
as ridiculous and petty to a trag­
ic degree. Furthermore, allowing 
the other individual fraternities 
(who obviously have little to lose 
from the disqualification of the 
second and fifth place qualifiers) 
instead of a neutral body of judges 
to decide on the legality and mo­
rality of the situation is absurd.
The endless rumors centering 
around Sigma Nu's “cheating" 
that have already begun to cir­
culate can only re-emphasize the 
pettyness and total lack of “class" 
displayed by a number of organ­
izations and individuals at this 
institution.
Before this year's Spring Car­
nival I was always able to point 
with pride and respect to one of 
the fines features of Carnegie- 
Mellon University — the strength 
and cooperation illustrated by the 
school's 12 fraternities. I deeply 
regret that I will be unable to 
leave this institution with any­
thing that approaches the same 
degree of respect.

Slave March Idea 
Classroom Liberals
Dear “Saturday Slave’’
I had a negative opinion of the 
slave march idea when I first heard 
about it. I live with slavery's after­
effects and I can’t really laugh 
about them. That was the cause 
of my first impression.
My second impression. I feel 
even more strongly. I don’t believe 
anyone has the right to make fun 
of such a situation if he can not 
cry over it; if he is not deeply 
affected by the American racial 
situation enough to do something 
about it; if he is not more than a 
“classroom liberal.” and some­
times. not even that.
In my first year here at CMU 
I’ve had to face a lot of disappoint­
ing realities about myself. The 
only good thing about this is that 
I’ve finally admitted them. I am 
very full of hate. Some of it. I 
know I didn’t have in September. 
A lot of it I learned the first week 
in April I am wrong. Each time 
I try tc overcome one prejudice 
I find three more. I’m admitting 
this, wit ti humility. I hope.
But sspecially since King's 
death. I can not take such exhibi­
tions as the slave march. If you 
cared. I might have laughed about 
it. But 1 ow many of you “slaves” 
really c.ire?

It is a loose, episodic-structured 
drama ; bout the hostility encoun­
tered by revolutio lary ideas in a 
retrogrtde society. A tribute by 
one iconoclastic genius to another 
of an aarlier period, the play 
places infinite demands on its 
principal actor.
Galileo was a man of prodigal 
talents and apetites; his passion 
for knowledge was matched by an 
equal passion for life. It was his 
instinct for self preservation that 
made him choose—when brought 
before the inquisition—the value 
of life over the less material val­
ue of his beliefs.
The choice was an agonizing one 
for Galileo as the play makes clear. 
His belief that man was not the 
center of the universe, collaborated 
by his observations on the tele­
scope, ran counter to the Coper- 
nican assumption of that time. Both 
Church and State were shocked 
by Galileo’s findings: the Church 
because it went against dogma and 
diminished man’s place in the uni­
verse; and the State because of its 
disruption of the Status Quo. Gal­
ileo was horrified by their unscien­
tific. small-minded attitude. He 
says of their resistance: “Whoever 
doesn’t know the truth is merely 
a fool. But whoever knows it and

Brecht thus unlike Shaw in his 
Saint Joan did not have the roman­
tic material for a drama of mar­
tyrdom. However, in exile at the

to a still-faithful follower, the 
plans for a new Discourse—no doubt 
challenging the laws of the Scien­
tific Establishment.
The point is that it is as impos­
sible for Galileo to change his 
nature as a scientist, as it is for 
Church and State to accept his 
ideas. Playing the part of this 
complex hero—or anti-hero—at the 
Playhouse is Max Gulak, who 
somewhat reminded me in appear­
ance of Herschel Benardi out of 
character. He does an excellent 
job within limits—he lacked the 
powerful charisma that the charac­
ter needed, a defect partly due to 
physical equipment. Carrying less 
weight on the cast are Doris Hack­
ney. Irend Bunde, William Hanson 
and countless others—all fine. Ron­
ald Satloff’s direction emphasized 
the low-key. austere power of this 
drama.
It has often seemed, at the 
Playhouse that popular entertain­
ment and intellectual theatre are 
completely separate. This produc­
tion shows that far from being a 
contradiction, difficult modern 
drama can be both good theatre 
and good boxoffice.
“Link” Orientation 
Relate Experiences
The first orientation session for 
“Link,” the Y’s action program 
with poverty neighborhood child­
ren and youth, will be held tomor­
row at 6 p.m. in 56 Skibo. The 
speaker will be Ken Garrison, a 
street worker in the Hill, who will 
describe the culture of the ghetto. 
A brief outline of the structure of 
“Link” will be given by Jeff Good- 
now. Pitt graduate student and 
“Link” coordinator. Former C-MU 
“Link” volunteers will also be on 
hand to share their experiences.
“Link’’ is a companionship pro­
gram begun three years ago by 
VISTA’s working in Pittsburgh. 
It has since been turned over to 
the YMCA of Pittsburgh and is 
now funded by the Community 
Chest, which makes payment of 
volunteers’ expenses possible 
“Link” volunteers are assigned 
to small groups of children or 
youth with whom they develop 
activities. This summer they will 
be encouraged to do informal tu­
toring with their groups or to work 
with them in neighborhood pro­
jects. such as developing small 
playgrounds
The meeting Thursday is open 
to anyone interested in any com­

New Frat House, Necessarv,toWhomZ
(Continued from Page 2)
I have also discovered that the 
fraternities don’t have a thing to 
say regarding their housing, and 
if they resist moving out when 
ordered to do so they will be ban­
ned from campus.
Why is the administration so 
concerned that all fraternities 
live in university-owned houses? 
The administration says it is so 
that houses don’t compete on the 
physical houses themselves. The 
idea is to make all houses phy­
sically similar so that rushees 
won’t judge them by appearance 
alone. If appears to me, however, 
that the administration is making 
excuses to cover up the fact that 
they are afraid of the potential 
power of the fraternities, and is 
attempting to keep the frats un­
der their thumb by controlling 
their housing.
For instance, the residents of 
the duplexes now hold a lease that 
is calculated to take 20 years to 
pay off. By shear coincidence, 
those duplexes were designed to 
fill the needs of the fraternities 
for only 20 years. Presumably at 
the end of 20 years, they will be 
replaced with houses of equal 
quality, and the cycle repeats. 
This means that the administra
Editor, The Tartan:
Something happened this week 
which most of us would not even 
consider to be significant. Some 
cars were towed away on May 1 
(Law Day, USA).
Now, that may not seem to be 
much, but several mistakes crept 
into the procedure the police used. 
First, they broke into the cars to 
set the transmissions and brakes 
for towing. Second, they search­
ed the glove compartments and 
personal effects in several of the 
cars.
It is illegal for anyone to enter 
a vehicle unless he has either a 
warrant or evidence that a felony 
has been committed on or in the 
car.
In New York, the police jack 
up the car without entering it, 
place it on rollers, and then tow 
it away. In Pittsburgh, it appears 
that the police do not find this 
necessary. It is up to us all to 
guard our basic freedoms against 
encroachment. If the police gain 
approval of their breaking and en­
tering jobs, who knows what 
they’ll t h i n k o f next? Maybe 
they’all apply the no warrant prin­
ciple to your house.
During the car towing show, 
one of our students — John Cooper 
—¦ was assaulted by one of the tow 
trucks (sounds funny, but that ’s 
the way the law reads). One of 
the drivers, in the spirit of friend­
ly activity that normally accom­
panies May Day, offered John a 
lift. Once John’s hand was on the 
door and his foot was on the run­
ning board, the driver decided to 
take off, leaving John hanging 
rather precariously on the side 
of the truck (license number 
Pennsylvania C39-74C).
This raises, or should raise, sev­
eral questions. First, since both 
the breaking and entering and the 
assault occured on Frew St. under 
the auspices of our friendly neigh­
borhood, Pittsburgh Police Sta­
tion, we once again must ask why 
a street which borders our cam­
pus, provides parking for our cam­
pus, and is trafficed by campus 
people is the property of the city.
Second, we should ask what the 
management of this school in­
tends to do about both the disrup­
tion of its students’ freedoms and 
an assault on one of its students.
tion is the fraternities’ landlord 
forever.
Well, that’s fine if we’re in the 
dark ages, but I think it’s time 
that the serfs rose up and took a 
stand in the situation. I’m tired 
of seeing them and the rest of the 
students who live on campus 
manipulated by the administra­
tion.
Those dorms up on the hill (the 
Ghetto area) are not worth the 
price of one'steam bug. We tried 
to find out exactly how old they 
are, but the dates have all worn 
off the corner stones. As close as 
we can determine, however, they 
have outlived their live expec­
tancy by about 20 years or so. 
They need replacing NOW, not 
in 40 or 50 years, or whenever 
the administrativn sees fit to do 
so. And they certainly are not 
worth an increase in price.
I say it’s time the administra­
tion quit using our money for 
their own benefit and put it 
where it will do the most good for 
the most people, lest their “Fund 
for Distinction” be renamed the 
“Fund for Extinction.”
Sincerely,
Third, we should ask what pres­
sure the management of the school 
intends to bring on the city to dis­
cipline its contractée for the as­
sault.
Clear answers to these ques­
tions would surely solve a lot of 
troubled minds.

ingly important opera program. 
To place these departments on op­
posite sides of the campus hin­
ders both of these important en­
deavors. It is particularly unfor­
tunate to separate these two de­
partments since by interdisciplin 
ary co-operation CMU could of­
fer a unique program combining 
good theatrical training for mu­
sicians desiring to go into opera 
(training not easily available), 
and excellent musical training for 
actors planning a career in mu­
sical comedy.
If the two departments were 
housed together they might also 
serve as the nucleus for a future 
CMU Performing Arts Center; a 
center in which the kind of uni­
que professional education now 
offered in theater and music 
could be expanded to include op­
era, dance, TV. and film. The 
new building is wisely planned 
adjacent to WQED but the plans 
should include provision for an 
opera stage, dance studios, and 
film making facilities. Such cen­
ter would keep CMU at the fore­
front of education in the arts at a 
time when such education is des­
perately needed.
Sincerely.

look at the top-heavy OEO and 
such projects, will have to admit 
that white efforts at coordinating 
both other whites and blacks have 
been more than slightly less than 
successful.
Second, for those who feel that 
there exists a great, unwashed 
body of eager people just waiting 
for a project to work on, let them 
just consider the fate of SCOPP. 
That Droiect was begun with the 
belief that the volunteers would 
flock to the program if only giv­
en the chance.. They got the 
chance. They blew it.
Third, and for space reasons, 
last, the Y already serves this 
function quite well. Additionally, 
they serve the coordinating func­
tion better than any official of­
fice sponsored by this school will. 
Dean Bradenberg, a member of 
the committee, should know that 
the Y has expert power and legiti­
macy in the minds of the stu­
dents. Any school sponsored of­
fice will have attached to it a 
“chilling effect” simply because 
it is so obviously school-hence, 
management-sponsored outfit. It 
will gather about it people who 
are looking for official sanction, 
activities keys, and brown noses. 
The sincere volunteers will prob­
ably be shoved to (or in) the rear 
and squeezed out of the projects. 
Not by any overt action, but mere­
ly because they will rapidly be­
come sick of the committee meet­
ings, hemming, hawing, butting, 
and squirming that seem to be at­
tached to organized efforts.
Now, a brief look at the person­
nel assigned the task of setting 
up the office is in order. The 
members of the administration 
who have a hand in this matter 
may or may not have knowledge 
of how to set up an office of this 
sort. But a fairly safe assertion is 
that they do not know the basics 
of the black communities’ feel­
ings or why those feelings are 
the way they are.
As for the student representa­
tives — Ron Haan, Gordie Cohn, 
and Jacqui Pratt — we can apply 
one good measure of interest and 
knowledge. That would be the 
“What have you done lately” 
measure. Since their announce­
ment that they were co-chairmen 
of the Student Government So­
cial Services Committee, little 
has been seen or heard out of 
either Jacqui or Gordie in the 
area of Social Services.
Their absence has been notable 
at YM-WCA Action meetings, at 
the lecture by Norman Johnston, 
at NEED meetings, at Martin Lu­
ther King Scholarship meetings, 
etcetera. It is true that Gordie 
has shown some interest above 
the average. But it is fairly ob­
vious that he is not among that 
group of people who should be 
consulted as to effective actions 
toward the establishment of a So­
cial Services Committee.
So, management, do two things. 
First, and most importantly, ques­
tion the value of setting up an of­
fice at all. It may have worked 
in the days of Mike Malarkoff 
but he is gone three years now 
and we cannot afford a three year 
lag. If you do deem it absolutely 
essential to have the office, get 
someone on the committee who 
knows what’s up.

New Service Office 
To Aid Community
At a recent meeting of Dr. 
Stever’s Presidential Staff, the 
establishment of a Community 
Service Office on the CMU cam­
pus was discussed and initial 
plans for its creation next fall 
were proposed. The Central Of­
fice purports to serve as liason 
between student volunteers and 
social service projects that here­
tofore have been a function of 
the campus Y. The new office 
would take over social services 
as its sole function, expanding 
the present limited facilities, and 
hopefully, extending itself in 
many new directions as well.
Several interested students 
have expressed a desire to in­
crease campus participation in 
such areas as social work in un­
derdeveloped communities and 
work study projects. The immed­
iate aim of the administration’s 
action is to determine just how 
much interest exists among CMU 
students to warrant the creation 
of an office of this kind.
A meeting of the committee 
will be held on May 8. At that 
time Dr. Kibbee, Dean Branden- 
berg, Mr. Strathmeyer, and Chair­
man Dean Brown will exchange 
ideas with students Jacqui Pratt. 
Gordon Cohn, and Ron Haan. 
Whether the Office will be ad­
ministered by a single trained 
person or by a student committee 
is yet to be decided. The commit­
tee also intends to contact other 
campuses with similar offices 
and to solicit the feelings of stu­
dents here.

spent the last year in studying 
the problems of the “Hippies”. 
This unpublished basic material 
will be first presented to the 
Isaac Seder Educational audience 
on Wednesday evening. Dr. Wal­

tration.
3. After students have secured 
final schedules they will report 
to a ’’bull pen” arrangement in 
the gymnasium. Upon leaving the 
department counselor, the stud­
ents’ course request will be time 
stamped. He must appear at the 
“bull penn” within a specified 
time span. Failure to do this will 
result in his returning at the catch­
all period later in registration. Stu­
dents will receive a card for each 
section of each scheduled course. 
A department representative will 
control the distribution of the class 
cards. Any changes necessary to 
a student’s schedule will be hand­
led by a department advisor in the 
“bull pen” area. Phone contact 
to the department will be estab­
lished to aid in these decisions. 
Those cases which cannot be hand­
led by the “bull pen” advisor will 
return to the department area for 
further counseling. A system for 
allowing an overload to a particu­
lar section will be developed. This 
will require authorization from the 
department and Registrar. Stu­
dents will complete registration 
by reporting to a check-out station 
in the “bull pen”. This station 
will perform a final edit on the 
class cards selected and collect 
the permit to register data.

assignments. This information will 
be available in the department of­
