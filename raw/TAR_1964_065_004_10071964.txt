Congress Chairman Sandulli 
Returns From Talk With LBJ
by Carol Guber
Joe Sandulli, Chairman of Carnegie Tech's Student 
Congress, visited Washington, D.C., last Saturday with 200 
other student body chairmen to meet with President Lyndon 
Johnson and members of his cabinet.
Preceding the President's* ” ... ~
speech, Secretary of State Dean 
Husk; Secretary of Defense, Rob­
ert McNamara; and Secretary of 
Labor, Williard Wirtz spoke to 
the group.
After the f o r m a 1 speeches,
Sandulli had the opportunity of 
speaking with the President and 
members of the cabinet at a 
buffet, dinner.
On his return Sandulli said:
“I felt, like the wide-eyed 
freshmen being ‘snowed’ by the 
big fraternity men Saturday night 
at what was the biggest rush 
event in the country. Instead of 
rush-girls, there was Lynda Bird;
Instead of combo’s from the Hill, 
there were: the Chad -Mitchill 
Trio, Bob Newhart, a n.d .Stan 
Getz. The rush-chairman, or more 
properly “house president,” was 
Lyndon Johnson.
“Student body presidents 
from 200 colleges including Car­
negie Tech were at the White 
House for an affair successfully 
acquainting us with some of 
the key people In our country 
and encouraging us to involve 
ourselves in our country’s busi­
ness. . ' .
Sandulli continued: “President 
Johnson condemned, a “spectator 
society.” To insure that we will 
become more closely acquainted 
with t h e governmental process 
than ever before, LBJ announced 
the establishment of “White 
House Fellows.” a plan to bring
young people, to Washington to 
serve as assistants to the Vice- 
President, and to each of the 
cabinet members for; a 15 month 
session. (Incidentally the plan is 
financed by the Carnegie Foun­
dation.) However the most power­
ful encouragement is to take an 
interest in our country’s mechan­
isms from the personal contact 
with our leaders.
“I threw away a most exqui­
site. White House meal to talk 
with Frances Keppel, Commis­
sioner of Education, the man re­
cently responsible for persuading 
Congress to legislate 7.500 new 
grants for college students, grants 
to liberal arts colleges to bal­
ance the overemphasis to engi­
neering, and a summer teaching 
program in which college students 
may teach in depressed areas of 
the United States. Keppel af­
firmed that any type of person, 
from engineers to dramats, is eli­
gible to become a “White House 
Fellow” and find a place in his 
nation’s government. The prime 
example is Keppel, himself, a 
former sculptor from Harvard.
“We students did more “poli- 
tiking” than the professionals in 
our attempts to corner LBJ and 
some of his cabinet as they walked 
among us. All President Johnson 
said about the impending elec­
tion was ‘I can’t ask you to vote 
Democratic, but I absolutely re-

Was Arrested in 1963 
For Similar Dorm Thefts
by Robert J. Fritz
A sneak thief, who is believed to have been burglarizing 
fraternity houses on the Carnegie Tech campus for three 
weeks,' was captured by the school's Security Police last 
Tuesday, September 29. 1
The first burglary occurred 
early on Tuesday morning, Sep­
tember 1-5.. At that time, a watch, 
two typewriters, and $19.00 in 
cash were stolen from the Tau 
Delta Phi fraternity house.
Five more complaints were re­
ported to the Security Office mak­
ing a total of fourteen victims.
Objects stolen were typewriters, 
cameras and wallets.
At first the criminal had few 
difficulties because niost frater­
nities did not lock their doors at 
night. But after Sigma Nu, Beta 
Theta Pi, Alpha Tau Omega, and 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, were, bur­
glarized, precautions in thè houses 
were increased.
The Sécurity Police deduced 
that the next burgulary would 
occur sometime between 5 and 9 
a.m. at SN or. BSR.
Arresting Officers
Seven police officers were sta­
tioned in this sector on Tuesday 
morning. At 7:30 a.m. the- sus­
pect entered the BSR house, and 
the officers closed in. The . sus­
pect became aware of'the police, 
and tried to run away. He was 
arrested by Sergeant Dale Pinto 
and Officer Al Boehm of the Car­
negie Tech Security Police.
The Security Police questioned 
him for several hours before turn­
ing him over to the Pittsburgh 
city Police.
According to William D.
Young, Chief of the Carnegie 
Tech Security Department, the 
burgular is the same man ar­
rested in August, 1963, for 
thefs in the men*s dormitories.
Chief Young emphasized that 
the suspect was a very adept 
burglar. He carried no weapons.
The same burglar is be­
lieved to bave stolen $25 In 
cash from five members of TDP 
in June of this year.
None of the stolen goods has 
been recovered. Anyone who has 
not reported any stolen goods is 
requested by Chief Young to do so.
The burglar was wearing a 
black “Shetland mohair” sweater 
by Schaparelli at the time of his 
arrest. The Security Police are 
looking for its owner to clinch 
the case.
The Council of Fraternity Pres­
idents had suggested that an all- 
night vigilance be established to 
trap the culprit.

Offensive Viet Action Urged
by Joe Califf
The only way we can win in South Vietnam is to start
offensive action against North Vietnam.
This was the position taken by Dr. Tran Van Chuong,
the former ambassador to the*--------------------------------------------------------'
United States from South Viet­
nam, as he spoke at the Tuesday 
morning assembly on Sept.
Talking about the struggle 
against the Viet Cong guerrillas 
in his country, Dr. Van Chuong 
stated that he North Vietnamese 
Communists have been aiding
and leading the rebels ever since 
South Vietnam’s creation in 1954
Although he mentioned it later 
at a luncheon meeting, Dr. Van 
Chuong made no mention, during 
his speech of the oppressive, cor­
rupt practices of the Diem re­
gime, - and that these practices 
have been a major reason for the 
Viet Cong’s success.
As he mentioned'later, time has 
found the ranks of the rebels 
getting larger as"more people c re 
alienated from the government.
When asked how much' support 
the rebels get from North Viet­
nam, he said that if nothing is 
done, the Viet Cong will soon be­
come self-sufficient. If this is so, 
then it is indeed questionable 
whether attacking North Vietnam 
will do any good.
Dr. CHuong also stated that the 
South Vietnamese are strongly 
anti-communist. But if this is 
true, why did Diem cancel the 
elections that were to have united 
the country according to the Gen­
eva agreement of 1954? Was this 
not because he knew he could not 
over the North Vietnamese 
leaders?
Rather than attack North Viet­
nam and risk a third world war 
or another Korea, it would seem 
more reasonable to join the two 
countries together with free elec­
tions, as originally planned. This 
arrangement could be supervised 
by the United Nations, the. only 
condition being that the united 
country would be neutralist ¦— 
meaning that it would not take 
sides in the cold war.
If, under this arrangement, the 
people of Vietnam choose Com­
munists to lead them, we will 
have no basis on which to support 
the South Vietnamese govern­
ment. If, however, the South 
Vietnamese people are as strong­
ly anti-communist as Dr. Chuong 
suggests^ and the conditions are 
as bad in the north as he claims, 
we have nothing to fear from this 
proposal.
Ceilidh To Hold 
Concerts At Duke
The Carnegie Ceilidh will 
begin its fourth year of folk- 
sings this Friday, it was an­
nounced by Howard Glasser, 
director of Ceilidh.
This year. Ceilidh folksing will

gathering for the purpose of mak­
ing music." The closest English 
translation of the word, according 
to teymologist Howard Glasser, is 
‘hootenanny.”
‘‘Hootenanny,” Glasser said, “is 
the closest English translation of 
Ceilidh.”

Honoraries Questioned
Student honor societies as they now exist on the Tech 
campus are plagued by innumerable problems.
These organizations, which were formed to recognize 
and encourage various kinds of achievement — in scholar­
ship, leadership, and/or service — are not fulfilling their 
potential.
Such societies, be-they departmental, class, or all-school, 
are suffering mostly because 1) the members of the groups 
themselves lack clear cut goals and purpose, and 2) members 
of the student body has no clear-cut definition of the purpose 
or function of honoraries.
Let’s view these two issues in more detail.
Most student honor societies have formal constitutions; 
when members are elected to honoraries the only indication 
they may have of what they are to do is in this formal docu­
ment. Yet most such constitutions simply say that they recog­
nize students who have met certain-scholastic standards and 
who may have contributed in some fashion to service or lead­
ership. No further purpose of the organization is established 
in many cases, ¦ and no statement of goals and how these 
goals are to be carried out is made. Members of the group 
thus have no distinct idea of what they should be doing.
In some cases, students may themselves know what 
they, as members of an honorary, are trying to achieve, but 
still cannot communicate this to the general student body 
because of lack of publicity or because they are not fulfilling 
their known purpose.
Why 'have these problems developed? One important 
reason is that membership in such organizations changes 
often; in many cases it changes each year, and little provision 
is made for real continuity, in the actions of the organization. 
Members may be chosen according to different standards 
each year, depending upon the whims of out-going members. 
Plans are made for one year, but little if any effort goes into 
learning and benefitting from that year’s experience, or for 
continuing that year’s work.
Another problem is that these organizations may not be 
large enough individually to contribute significantly to the 
encouragement of student achievement or to campus affairs. 
Working together, however, they could accomplish much and 
could give real meaning to the term “honorary.”
The paradox in the entire situation stems from the fact 
that individual members of these organizations are dynamic, 
interested people who are concerned about the position of 
honoraries but who do not know how they can effectually 
alter their condition.
Therefore, it is proposed that an Honors Gouricil be form­
ed. Two members of each honor society would be.elected to 
take part in this council; it would be the purpose of this 
body to ^
¦ 1) Review Constitutions of honoraries and see that clear 
definitions of purpose were established, understood 
by members, and maintained.
2) Review membership selection standards and see that 
these standards were fixed and met so that election 
to an honorary would require real achievement.
3) Serve as a body for facilitating communication be­
tween honor societies so that they are aware of each 
other’s goals and plans and could work together 
whenever it is most efficient to do so.
4) Publicize the standards, goals, and accomplishments 
of student honor societies to the student population.
Such a council would, hopefully, serve to control the quality 
of honoraries, to promote carry-over of work from year to 
year, to serve as a sounding board for problems which de­
velop. In: this way, honor societies could begin to function 
more effectively. They would be more meaningful organiza­
tions in all respects, to all concerned.
Editor Questions Dean 
About Tartan Editorial
As a follow-up to the September 30 editorial regarding 
the Penn B calendar; Assistant News Editor, Sue Attirison, 
interviewed Dean Brown. He is chairman of the Carnegie 
Tech Calendar Committee.
Q. What was your general 
reaction to the September 30 
editorial? A. I. was pleased to 
see that the students have so much interest in the university 
calendar. .
O. The editorial implies that 
little is done to revise the Tech 
calendar. Is this true? 
calendar committee meets for 2-3 
months yearly to study possible 
modifications. The suggested cal­
endars are sent for criticism to 
various college councils; after 
studying these opinions, the Cal­
endar Committee submits the sug­
gested calendar to the Adminis­
trative Council that these would 
not be advantageous.
There was a definite evaluation 
of other term systems in i962.
^mong those possibilities con­
sidered was the Penn B calendar.
Q. What were the Commit­
tee’s objections to the Penn “
system? A. Though critics found 
the spring term very satisfac­
tory, they could not accept the 
fall term schedule.
Major disadvantages of the cal­
endar were the necessity that stu­
dents and faculty arrive at school on or about the Labor Day Week­
end, and the absense of time al­
lotment for three hour finals in 
the fall.
The Engineering and Science 
department particularly object­
ed to the breach of EPCD roles.
Q. What is the possibility for 
major calendar change? A- The 
Calendar Committee will recon­
vene in November to suggest 
changes. But statistically it finds 
the semester system to be most acceptable.
Q. Can students influence cal­
endar changes? A. They have al­
ways had the opportunity, es­
pecially through the undergradu­
ate advisory board.

North Side Project Seeks 
Tutoring Volunteers
Editor, the Tartan:
As anyone who reads the various 
bulletin boards at Carnegie Tech 
knows, there exists in Pittsburgh 
at least two programs designed to 
enrich the academic and cultural 
lives of some of this city’s under­
privileged children.
College students from all the 
campuses in Pittsburgh are being 
asked to serve as tutors for the 
Hill Education Project (HEP) and 
the North Side Tutorial Project 
(NSTP) programs.
While the University of Pitts­
burgh has been recruiting over 
two hundred people for. the HEP 
which it runs, the varoius neigh­
borhood houses and church groups 
jointly sponsoring the North Side 
Tutorial Project are asking Car­
negie Tech, Chatham, and Du­
quesne University students to tu­
tor on the North Side.
So far, a total of eight Carnegie 
students have each volunteered to 
tutor from one and a half to two 
hours~per week.
While it may indeed require a 
special effort to help in some email 
way to break the cycle of the 
ghetto, this effort is being made 
by college students throughout the 
country, from Harvard to South- 
¦em Illinois University, to the 
University of California at Ber­
keley,
In St. Louis, for example, stu­
dents at Washington University 
are tutoring in the elementary, 
junior, and senior high schools of 
a depressed and discrimdnated- 
against community, and in lierally 
dozens of schools across America, 
similar programs are functioning.
The .;NSTP is only one of many 
such programs which are enabling 
college students to channel some 
of their idealism into practical, 
significant activity.
The university is a part of the 
community. It does not and can­
not operate in a vacuum, and these 
projects only reflect this.
The eight who have volunteered 
here will not change the world in 
one semester, but they will have 
put a new dimension into their 
own education, for these pro­
grams certainly present two-way 
opportunities.
Information about the North 
Side Tutorial Project can be ob­
tained at the Campus YMCA- 
YWCA Office, Room. 57, Skibo, or 
by calling Jean Renaud at 682- 
8896.

State of Weapons System |
To Bolster GOP Candidate j
by Robert J. Frit* Wj
Recently, while reading an article in a technical maga- ^ ||
zine subscribed to by many engineers and management 
people in the. defense industry, I came across a most interest- 
ing advertisement. For a dollar/ 
it said, you could buy a bumper sticker which conveyed the mes­
sage, “Phase Out MacNamara.”
An article in another magazine 
referred to the “Edsel genius and 
his quiz kids.”
Such statements are not meant 
in jest. Rather they are very 
bitter criticisms of the Kennedy- 
Johnson defense policy and, 
above all, Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.
The Goldwater forces have 
taken up this banner. One criti­
cism is the sad state of the air­craft industry. Last year, for 
instance, nearly 'all of the big 
aircraft companies lost money, 
and thousands of men were laid 
off. According to some, all this 
resulted from Mr. MacNamara’s 
decision to “phase out” manned 
aircraft and rely instead upon 
ICBMs and Polaris subs. His 
computerized cost - effectiveness 
studies showed that -more 
megatons per dollar were pos­
sible with missiles.
Is this not good economy? No, 
answer the Goldwater supporters.
For one thing aircraft are re­
usable. For another, we can keep 
some of them on a flying alert — 
impossible to knock out. Still an­
other advantage is that they can 
be recalled if some hot war turns 
out to be a false alert.
The decision to rely on missiles 
alone, although made over the 
objections of Air Force generals 
and Congressmen, was probably 
based on sound information.
Still, a glaring fact remains.
Today there is not a single 
strategic weapons system in 
operation or on the drawing 
boards that was not initiated 
before 1960. Soviet develop­
ment, despite the so-called 
detente with the West and the 
nuclear test-ban has probably 
not lagged so seriously. Such 
facts are sure to help Barry 
Goldwater in November.
One Eisenhower program which 
has survived is the F-lll, or 
TFX, an all-purpose fighter plane 
which will be equally at home 
strafing bad guys in Viet Nam or 
shooting down supersonic bomb­
ers at 80,000 feet. It could land on 
an aircraft carrier to boot. Un­
fortunately it raises even more 
questions than it answers.
weight, and that this was 
feasible.
Apparently some confusion 
exists within the vast bureauc­
racy of our government, for at 
the time (1962) a secret 2200 
m.p.h. aircraft (the A-ll) had 
been flying with a titanium skin 
for over a year.
At present the. TFX design is 
somewhat overweight. The afore- ft 
mentioned A-ll is a very re­
markable airplane, not only be­
cause, as a replacement for the 
U-2 reconnaissance plane, it is 
impervious to any known missile, 
but' because of the versatility it 
assumed as the campaign 
mounted.Several months ago a new 
fighter plane was announced.
The new YF-12A, however, was 
only the A-ll with a different ,r 
name. As a fighter it is a total 
failure. It cannot fly well at 
low altitudes and needs a 100- 
mile radius just to turn around.
Soon it was given the name 
SR-71, this time a bomber. Un­
fortunately its design prohibits 
it from dropping bombs effec­
tively. Truly a remarkable air­
craft!
These are MacNamara’s boon­
doggles. Admittedly this column 
appears to be one-sided. This is ** 
because Goldwater has not as yet 
attacked most of these questions 
and hence Johnson has not made 
any attempt to answer them pub­
licly. As time goes on, they will 
figure increasingly in the cam­
paign, as Goldwater has much to 
gain by introducing them.
Hindsight-is always easier than 
foresight.
It is well to remember 
boondoggles are not new to u>w •- }ur1 
Department of Defense, and that 
John F. Kennedy’s narrow victory 
in 1960 was certainly not hinder­
ed by his criticism of the missile 
gap and the then-feeble space 
program.

Congressional
Report
by Cindy Etkin and Liz'Seley
Student-Congress convened 
last Wednesday, for its first 
session under the leadership 
of Chairman Joe Sandulli.
Sandulli opened the meeting 
with a brief explanation of the 
voter and his responsibility to the 
student body and to Congress. He 
added that all student legislation 
must ultimately be approved by 
a two-thirds majority vole m Congress.
Joe Bowman, head of the As­
sembly Committee, proposed a 
change in ' policy for this year’s 
assembly programs. Emphasis will 
be placed on “quality rather than 
quantity.”
Assembly personalities will in­
clude Drew Pearson and John 
Martino. On October 20, a spec­
ial political- program will be pre­
sented. Several state candidates 
will discuss local and national is­
sues.
The second report was given 
by the head of the Freshman 
Orientation and Rules Commit­
tees, Dick Elder. Elder said that 
work must begin now for next 
fall if an effective freshman ori­
entation plan is to be ready for 
the Class of 1969. He added that 
there will be a complete revision 
of the Student Handbook.,The budget for Homecoming 
Weekend was accepted as pro­
posed. The total figure is $4,730.
Mike Gross, chairman of the 
General Campus Committee, 
stressed the need for longer „li­
brary hours. He explained that
there might be. a one-month «rial 
period to use library facilities af­
ter 10 p.m.
A proposal for the installment 
of the “Penn B Calendar” was 
made. This would call for the 
starting of school just after La­
bor Day and the termination of 
semester before Christmas recess. 
Second semester would . begin, 
early in January and end al the 
beginning of May. Gross added 
that this would enable students 
to have better summer job op­
portunities.
The Union Committee will be­
gin the job of redecorating and 
reorganizing Skibo as a core foi 
student activities.New business proposals called 
for a petitioning for new ping-

Kodak Gives
Grants to Tech
Grants totaling $27,400 have 
been awarded to Carnegie Tech 
under Eastman Kodak Company’s 
educational aid program for 1964.
The grant is one of five awards 
given by Kodak this year in con­
nection with endowment pro­grams, capital fund drives, and 
other college and university proj­
ects that require special funds;
This award is intended to help 
Carnegie Tech compensate for the difference between the actual cost 
of educating men and women who 
are now with Kodak, and the 
amounts these former students 
may have paid in tuition and 
fees.
Nasty Artists
Thomas Nast exposed the 
vicious Tweed Ring in New 
York through his cartoons.
You too can expose Che Tweed 
Ring right here on campus.

Wednesday, October 7, 1964 — CARNEGIE TECH TARTAN — Pae» T'
Tartans Overpower Case;
Merrill Scores Two TDs
Merrill plunges through line with blockers in clearing position.
by Ron Bidula
Junior fullback Dick Merrill sparked Carnegie Tech to 
its first victory of the season last Saturday at Tech Field. The 
Tartans convincingly topped Case Tech 21-6 while Merrill 
gained 198 yards in 19 carries and scored two touchdowns.
Neither team was able to move 
in the initial minutes of the game.
C1T took the opening kick-off 
from their own 35 to mid-field in 
three plays before Case recovered 
a Wisniewski fumble on the next 
play. The Tartan line was tough, 
however. Fullback Jim Greenfield 
tested the Carnegie line twice for 
short gains and a long Steve Penn 
aerial was incomplete, forcing 
Case to punt.
The Tartans were penalized 
twice to their own 15 before they 
moved only six yards in three 
3 plays. CIT then punted to the vis­
itors 48, and a twelve yard return 
was nullified by a clipping pen­
alty, giving Case the ball oh their 
own 45. The two teams then cau­
tiously felt each other out as 
short gains on the ground pro­
duced another exchange of punts, 
giving Case Tech the ball on the 
Carnegie 28 after a fine return by 
Penn at 4:32.
^ Case Scores First
Halfback Steve Padget gained 
fifteen to the CIT 13 and Green­
field plunged to the 8, but the 
Tartans dropped Padget for a loss 
back to the 13 on the next play 
Case was not to be stopped on 
this drive, however. Greenfield 
circled left end to the 2 and 
plunged over right guard two 
plays later for the score. The kick 
was off to the left and the Tar- 
^ tans trailed 6-0 with 0:23 left in 
the quarter. Jim Black returned 
the kick-off to the CIT 24 as the 
quarter ended.
Gilchrist gained four over left 
tackle as the second period open­
ed. On the next play Wisniewski 
was hit as he released the ball, 
but Dave D’Appolonia magnifi­
cently stole the ball from a Case 
defender for a CIT completion 
and a nine yard gain. Carnegie’s 
$ ground game then failed momen­
tarily as Merrill fumbled a pitch- 
out and covered it. for a short 
loss.
Tartans Strike Bade 
Then lightning struck. On the 
first play from scrimmage, a Penn 
to Junia aerial bounced off the 
end’s fingertips and into the wait­
ing arms of Tartan defender Dick 
Merrill. Dick eluded the startled
Rough Riders in front of him and 
scooted twenty-seven yards for 
Carnegie Tech’s first score of the 
year. Wisniewski split he uprights 
and the Tartans led 7-6 at 11:30, and the grandstand erupted.
Penn returned the kick-off to 
the Case 27 where frosh Tom 
Hubka knocked him out 
bounds. The fired-up CIT defense 
stiffened ' after yielding thirteen 
yards in two plays to Greenfield 
and Padget, and three plays later 
Penn kicked to the Carnegie 29. 
Merrill returned to he 36.
CIT kicked to the Case 25 after 
only three plays and then the 
pace slowed considerably as 
neither team could move the 
sticks consistently. Padget and 
Greenfield again bore the brunt 
of the Case Tech offensive load as 
did Merrill and Gilchrist for the 
Tartans. Wis was having a bad 
day in the air as time and again 
he overthrew his receivers in the 
clear.
The two teams again traded 
punts as they stayed on the 
ground for the most, part and ran 
out the clock with no serious 
threats being mounted. At half- 
time, the small tiut enthusiastic 
crowd was entertained by bands 
from both Case and Carnegie as 
well as from Wilkinsburg and 
North Hills High Schools.
Merrill Stuns Case
Case again kicked off to the 
Tartans to open the second half.1
After a short gain by Gilchrist, 
Merrill again electrified the 
crowd as he took a hand-off on 
his own 29 and literally tore 
through the Case defense with 
good broken, field running for 
fifty-seven yards to the Case 14.
Bill Coleman clipped a Case 
pursuer after the tackle, however, 
and the penalty moved the ball 
back to the 29. Gilchrist gained eight to the 21, but two incomplete 
passes and a short plunge by 
Merrill ended the Tartan threat at the 20, and Case took over.
Case then quickly moved thirty- 
four yards in four plays to the 
CIT 46 with the big play a 
twenty-five yard roll out and run 
around right end by Steve Penn. 
Chuck „ Kandziolka covered a 
Greenfield fumble on the next 
play, and CIT took over at 8:26.
Drive Pays Off 
Carnegie Tech then moved 
fifty-four yards in eight plays for 
its second score of the day. Gil­
christ and Merrill again moved 
the ball for CIT on the ground 
and Jim Black made a key catch 
at he Case 30 to sustain the drivé. 
The drive was capped when Wis 
again- hit Black with a sideline 
pass as the 1 and Jim went over 
for the score. Wis was true with the PAT and CIT led 14-6 at 6:00 
Case quickly moved to mid­
field after the kick-off, but the 
Tartan defense stiffened and forced a Case punt to the Car­
negie 18 at 1:55. Two plays later 
Mueller recovered a Dick Mer­rill fumble for Case at the CIT 25 
as the quarter ended.
Merrill Scores Again 
The Tartans smelled victory 
though and three plays later Mer-

rill knocked Padget out of bounds 
on the 18 short of the first down, 
and CIT took over. After Gil­
christ gained seven up the mid­
dle, Merrill again brought the 
crowd to its feet with a sparkling 
display of agility, speed, and de­
sire. After taking a pitchout from Wisniewski, he burst through the 
line and eluded the Case secon­
dary for a seventy-five yard TD 
run and his second score of the 
day. The PAT was good and Tech 
now led 21-6 at 12:35.
. Three plays later, Tom Hubka 
intercepted an errant Case pass 
and returned it to the visitors’ 38 
at 9:30. CIT moved to the 15 in 
six jjlays on long gains by Gil­
christ and Barth and a key recep­
tion by D'Appolonia, but a pen­
alty coupled with a stubborn Case 
defense gave the visitors the ball 
at 3:18.
; By now Case was too desperate 
to be effective. Four plays gave 
CIT the ball at the Case 20, and 
Tech quickly moved to the visi­
tor's 9. A penalty and a long loss by Rubka as he couldn’t spot a 
receiver forced Tom . to try a long 
pass on third down. McGreary 
couldn’t hold on to the ball, 
though, and Tech had to give 
Case one last chance after a 
Hubka sneak -was stopped at the 
iine of scrimmage.A long pass and .a lateral after 
the catch to Padget surprised the 
Tartans, but it was too late for 
the visitors from Cleveland.

IM Grid To Be Hotly Contested
by Allen Green
From the opening kick-off it became evident that the 
race for the school championship in intramural football 
could be one of the most strongly contested in recent years. 
At the present time there are at* 
least six teams who could take ’ 
all the marbles, and two more 
with a better than average chance 
to finish on top if a few breaks 
fall their way.
The Giants League has two of 
the top contenders in Sigma Nu 
and SAE. Led by their passing 
ace, quarterback Harvey Gam­
mon, SAE rolled over the Good 
Guys by a score of 30 to 1, and 
then came back to trounce the 
Dinks 49 to 1. In both games 
it was the effective passing ~ of 
Gammon to Don Pitman, Willie 
McClure, and company which 
broke the game wide open in the 
early minutes, as the Dinks and 
the Good Guys just couldn’t cope 
with SAE’s aerial- game.
Meanwhile, Sigma Nu downed 
BTP “B” 22 to 8, and then came 
out on top of the Good Guys by 
a 22 to 13 score. The well-oiled 
offense of Sigma Nu, led by quar­
terback John Blue and ends Lads 
Dawson, was more than effective 
against the Beta’s and the Good 
Guys, but the key to Sigma Nu’s 
attack this year is their hard­
hitting defense.
Time and time again the Beta’s 
were trapped in their own sec­
ondary by onrushing Sigma Nu’s, 
and tfrTS'proved to be the dif­
ference as the Beta's did some 
hard rushing on their own, and
pany gave Blue as much as he 
wanted to handle. Other league 
games found the Beta's “B” down­
ing the Organization 19-12, the 
Celler Dwellers downing the 
Dinks 14 to 3, and then defeat­
ing the Organization 19 to 5 de­
spite three defensive interceptions 
by Tom Shannon of the Organi- 
gation.
Over in the Eagles -League the 
GSIA “Gold” sputtered all over 
th.e field for the first half against 
the Tigers, and fell behind, 11-0. 
However, with the appearanee on 
the sidelines of Howie Pifer in 
the second half, as Howie opened* 
his drive for MVP in intramural 
cheerleading, the grads took 
heart and came back to claim 
16 to. 11 decision.
What the grads lacked in ma­
neuverability, they made up - in 
strength, as they wore the fresh­
men down in the final quarter. 
PKA proved that they will be 
worth watching as they took ; 
14-1 first half lead over the Ti­
gers and went on to win 33 to 8. 
In the other league game, TDP 
came back strongly in the sec­
ond half to defeat TX .26 to 7.
In the Steelers League, John 
•Regan scored twice to lead the 
Finks to a 40 to 8 win over the 
Dips, and then received help from
at times Roger Powell and com- Rubin and Zahren in a 16 to 12
win over Delta Tau Delta. Jan 
Earley scored twice to lead the 
Delts past KS, 28 to 13, and the 
Kappa Sigs didn’t find thé Grad 
Nads any easier as they dropped 
a 27 to 9 decision to them.
Finallÿi in the Browns League, 
Beta Sig defeated the Whales by 
an 18 to 9 score behind John 
Oppenheimer, Steve Zimmerman, 
and Steve Kessler. The Whales 
came back in the second half to 
defeat PKT 19 to 9, and DXÄ 
handéd the Phi Kaps a 15 to 5 
setback.
Of the remaining top-contending 
tèams in IM play, Alpha Tau 
Omega» Beta Theta Pi, and the 
GSIA “B^ack” do hot see action 
until this week, and at its con­
clusion the top contenders for the 
IM . crown will probably be well 
established.
Thinclads Get v 
23rd Victory
The Carnegie Tech cross-coun­
try team rolled to its twenty-third 
consecutive victory last Saturday

Harriers. The score of the meet
