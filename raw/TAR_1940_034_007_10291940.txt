Carnegie Institute
“Survey of American Painting” 
Includes Work of Faculty
By Walter Stull
After a preview last Thursday 
evening as climax to the annual 
Founder’s Day observation, the 
Carnegie Institute formally open­
ed its “Survey of American Paint­
ing” to the public the following 
morning.
The “Survey” is an outstanding 
collection of American art as­
sembled .after a painstaking three 
months search of American gal­
leries and private collections, and 
is designed to replace this year 
the usual “International” exhibit, 
made impossible by the European 
war.
The paintings hung cover a pe­
riod of 270 years—from the ear­
liest art in the colonies to the 
present time. The exhibit in­
cludes two sections, the retrospec­
tive and the contemporary. The 
retrospective section contains a 
cross section of the work of artists 
of the past, while the contempor­
ary section contains only paintings
Vital Democracy
of living artists. As a whole, the 
exhibit covers the development of 
American painting in relation to 
the social and cultural life of the 
country.
In the Contemporary section 
hang two paintings by faculty 
members of the Department of 
Fine Arts. They are Professor Car­
ter’s “City View,” a panorama as 
seen from a shack on the river­
front; and “As The Sparks Fly Up­
ward,” by associate Professor War­
ner, a winter view of the Jones & 
Laughlin mills as seen from the 
slums of the South Side.
There is a total of 367 paint­
ings in the exhibition, which will 
remain open until December 15. 
A series of Tuesday evening lec­
tures is being given in connec­
tion with the exhibit, the first of 
which will be delivered this eve­
ning by Homer Saint-Gaudens, 
director of the Department of Fine 
Arts of the Institute. Four addi­
tional lectures will be given be­
fore the close of the exhibition.
Pittsburgh Community Forum 
Sponsors Valuable Institution
By Gilbert Kivenson
At a time of stress such as Am­
erica is now experiencing, there 
is a great deal of discussion con­
cerning the inherent rights of citi­
zens, the original intent of the 
constitution signers, the advisabil­
ity of a third term, and the prin­
ciples of democracy in general.
Every gas station attendant, 
barber, or coal miner who reads 
the daily newspaper can be found 
spouting half-baked opinions on 
present day issues. The college 
student ’ blissfully ignores what is 
going on while the so-called “in­
telligentsia” display their good 
taste by refraining from opinions 
of any sort. The above condition 
is the result of one thing—lack of 
authoritative information.
The Community Forum of Pitts­
burgh was founded in 1934 with 
the sole purpose of supplying a 
source of information for all those 
who cared to listen and to ask 
questions. The group in charge 
met great difficulties at first in 
attempting to interest leading 
Pittsburgh citizens and in raising 
funds to secure a hall. Once the 
idea was accepted, however, en­
thusiasm spread like wildfire. 
Leading figures in the fields of 
science, art, politics and education 
were contracted to speak before 
an audience which/soon overflow­
ed the auditorium, and to answer 
such questions as the most humble 
of theif^.audiehce might propose. 
It seemed that here, at last, was
a means of producing informed 
citizens who had the information 
for intelligent thought at their 
fingertips. Like the Bill of Rights, 
the Community Forum was found 
generally satisfactory, but also 
like the Bill of Rights, it began, 
in time, to be taken for granted. 
The attendance has decreased very 
little, but it represents too much 
of a fixed group. College student 
participation is noticeably slack.
“It is the purpose of the forum 
to promote the discussion of mat­
ters of public concern under the 
leadership of acknowledged au­
thorities in the interest of truth, 
fair play, and mutual enlighten­
ment, with full opportunity for 
participation by the audience.” 
This is the platform of the Com­
munity Forum’. Unlike other plat­
forms, however, it makes no men­
tion of parties, nor does it at­
tempt to influence legislation or 
political thought in any direction. 
Instead, it is proposed to supply 
the average man with enough in­
formation for the forming of an 
intelligent opinion.
Thirty speakers are contracted 
each season. The forum is self sup­
porting—paying for the auditor­
ium, heat, light, etc., from con­
tributions by patrons. Among 
prominent speakers who have led 
the discussion in the past are 
Maurice Hindus, Robert Hutchins, 
Pierre Von Paasen, Granville

Thistle must be ordered and tak­
en before school is resumed after 
the Thanksgiving vacation, De­
cember 2. Orders may be placed 
in Administration, Arts, or Mar­
garet Morrison buildings between 
the hours of 11:30 and 1:20 daily. 
The price, $2.00, includes a paid-

ceptable picture to be used in the 
yearbook.
Anyonesmay have his name and 
social fraternity or sorority stamp­
ed on the cover of his 1941 Thistle

week day periods during the next 
few weeks. Notices will be posted 
on the bulletin boards one week 
in advance and postal cards will 
be sent to the presidents of the 
groups. Failure of a group to have 
its picture taken as scheduled will 
result in the loss of space in the 
yearbook or in a $1.00 fine for 
rescheduling. The Editor or the 
Photographic Editor, on the basis 
of the circumstances concerning, 
the failure of the group to be 
present, will inflict the penalty.
Copies of group photographs 
will be available in glossy finish, 
8"xl0". Orders for these pictures 
will be taken at the time of the 
scheduling of the picture.
Election Notice
Students who "Wish to vote on' 
Election Day, November 5, 1940, 
will be excused from class, upon 
seeing their department advisor. 
This action was taken by the Ex­
ecutive Board to encourage all 
students of age to vote.
Dancing Team 
Gives Exhibition
In the past, classes in popular 
dancing have been conducted by 
the faculty and students. This year 
a professional dancing couple, af­
ter applying to the Executive 
Board, received permission to 
hold a dancing school on Campus.
Today at 4:30 P. M., Miss Helen 
Whitehead and Mr. Richard Mark 
Turner, instructors in dancing 
from the Chalif School of Dance, 
Rockefeller Centre, N. Y. C., will 
give a professional exhibition in 
Thistle Hall.
The couple in charge of the 
branch studio of the Chalif School 
located in the Hotel Schenley, will 
present the “Fun Fest,” a demon­
stration of popular ballroom danc­
ing with audience participation.
At this time, arrangements will 
be made for prospective students. 
The course consists of ten weekly 
sessions of informal dancing, each 
one and a half hours long. The ac-' 
tual cost per lesson will depend on 
the number of applicants; how­
ever the price range will be be­
tween 35c and 50c.
Draft Numbers
Local draft boards yesterday is­
sued numbers to the men who 
registered two weeks ago. These 
numbers will not be posted on the 
campus. Students should contact 
the draft boards in their home 
towns in order to receive their 
lottery numbers.
IRC Holds Discussion
The Axis Powers have long been 
eyeing the Mediterranean Area. 
When the expected attack comes, 
Egypt will probably be the center 
of "a great deal of gruesome ac­
tivity. What, exactly, is Egypt’s 
part in .the present world situa­
tion? This.is the problem the In­
ternational Relations Club will 
tackle at its meeting tomorrow at 
3:30 at the Union.
All Carnegie women are invit­
ed to attend the discussion and 
give their opinions on this prob­
lem of international importance.
Studes, Air Your 
Hidden Talents
Carnegie Tech’s annual liter­
ary publication, The Bard, is be­
ginning its search for suitable ma­
terial for this year’s issue. Stu­
dents are urged to submit poems, 
essays and short stories to Box 
409, Carnegie Tech Post Office.
The Bard, two issues of which 
have already.appeared in previous 
years, is under the sponsorship of 
a board set up by Alpha Chi Al­
pha and Phi Delta Epsilon, men 
and women’s journalistic honor- 
aries. Although last year’s issue 
was printed as an insert in the 
Tartan, because of insufficient 
funds, the Board hopes the 1940- 
41 Bard will be in magazine form.
Because The Bard is the only 
place where Carnegie students can 
publish purely literary contribu­
tions, Techites should take ad­
vantage of this magazine to re­
lieve themselves of that poem or 
story or essay that they’ve been 
thinking about all this time, but 
that they’ve never written.
Election Results 
Are Announced
Results of the freshman elec­
tions held in the three colleges 
last week are as follows:
College of Engineering: presi­
dent, Herbert Asten; vice presi­
dent, James Voelz; secretary, John 
Lindberg; treasurer, Robert Jones.
Margaret Morrison: president, 
Sara Jane Moir; vicc president, 
Ruth Beall; secretary, Marie Sun- 
seri; treasurer, Dorothy Hooper, 
and senate representative, Thalia 
Harmany.
College of Fine Arts: president, 
James Boyce; vice president, Har­
vey I-Iaincjs; secretary, Elizabeth 
Ward, and treasurer, Raymond 
Fisher.
S’nS Calls Writers
There will be a meeting of the 
Scotch and Soda Club on Thurs­
day at 4:30 in the Fine Arts The­
atre. All present members of the 
club are asked to attend, as well 
as anyone -at all on the campus 
interested in writing either music 
or scripts for the 1941 show.

singing torch songs to tacking 
scenery—is a member of the club 
as it now stands.

Campfire
Lodge Provides Fuel As Girls 
Enjoy a Big Campfire Blaze
By Maita Sivitz and 
Barbara Kramer
The annual Margaret Morrison 
picnic took place last Wednesday 
in the lodge near the Bowling 
Green and a hot time was had by 
all. More than one hundred girls 
attended: naturally, for the free 
eats included weiners, buns, baked 
beans and coffee.
Five Maggies with campfire 
backgrounds: Lightheart, Heavy- 
foot, Leaping Flames, Glowing 
Embers, and Sooty-Puss, were at­
tracted to the kitchen, where there 
was a huge old wood and coal 
stove. The little campfire gals 
piled fuel on the fire and put the 
kettles on to warm. .When the 
stubborn beans got lukewarm 
enough to be edible, Glowing Em­
bers pushed them aside to make 
room for the coffee, and, glancing 
upward, noticed a flame flickering 
in the flue near the ceiling. “Evi­
dently,” she reasoned, “a twig is 
lodged in the chimney and the 
sparks have ignited it.” Meanwhile 
Sooty-Puss scurried out to call in 
the picnickers, who had been play­
ing tag and other frolicking games, 
to get their refreshments.
The panting hordes of hungry 
athletes poured into the dining 
room where all the food was 
spread out in buffet style. Sooty- 
Puss returned to the kitchen to 
report that a. good bit of smoke 
was pouring out of the eaves of 
the roof above the stove. A mo­
mentary pause in. conversation 
made audible a crackling sound 
which was travelling between the 
roof and the ceiling.
After a few rousing camping- 
songs, Lightfoot sniffed the air as 
she turned to her K. P. pals say­
ing, “Kids, I think the joint’s on 
fire.” Lightheart said, “That’s what 
I think, too,” and sauntered out 
to ask Professor Historia to call 
the fire department. The afore­
mentioned professor finished his 
sandwich as he set off on his mis­
sion. Meanwhile Leaping Flames 
casually mentioned to Professor 
Neolithicum that the building was 
on fire and asked him to tell the 
one hundred gals sitting around 
the table and munching on hot- 
dogs to take their plates outside 
on to the slope in front of - the 
lodge.
By this time the place was fill­
ed with smoke and the picnickers 
were beginning to think something 
was amiss, so they filed out, care­
fully carrying the food. Glowing 
Embers, while spreading mustard 
on her bun, bravely dashed back 
to rescue the coffee-pot from the 
stove for without it the meal 
would not have been complete.
At this point the flremen arrived, 
dragged out their hoses, shoulder­
ed their axes and scaled the walls 
with long ladders. The Maggies 
sat on the lawn watching the bril­
liant glow against the evening sky, 
and singing campfire songs while 
the lodge burned.
Editor’s Note—The Park Com­
mission returned the five dollars 
which the Margaret Morrison Sen­
ate had deposited, to be refunded, 
if the lodge were left as it was 
found.
Petite Tech Models

Ardent Tea-Goers
It’s a give-away. Tech-in-color 
is not only giving you a preview 
of the latest in wearables for 
such fashion conscious studes as 
those on the Tech campus, but 
each and every girl who attends 
the fashion fest will receive a 
card entitling her to a free Elmo 
beauty kit. And all you gals have 
to do is simply traipse yourselves 
down to FRANK and SEDER’S 
to claim it. (Them?)
Hahnting Refrains Featured
Our little rhapsody which, as 
you all know by now, was dream­
ed up by Ed Hunt, will be set to 
music by Jerry Hahn—who calls 
his nine-piece band—“Jerry Hahn 
and His Haunting Rhythms.” To 
carry out the weird effect—the 
boys’ theme song is “The House 
Is Haunted.” Jerry says that 
they’ve been playing for style 
shows (as well as numerous ho­
tels, night spots, weddings, danc­
es, etc.) for years now. How that 
can be we can’t figure out, since 
their ages range from 21 to 24. 
Maybe they were child prodigies 
or something. Anyhow, them's the 
boys that will ‘haunt’ you during 
the show, and at the tea dance af­
terwards. ALL FOR FREE.
Ready? Here’s the second give­
away. As you come In the door to 
the Gym you will, all be handed 
tickets, one halt' of. which will be 
placed in a box. Or hat. Or some­
thing. When Tech-ln-color is 
over ancl just before the danc­
ing starts a drawing will, bo held 
lo see who the lucky dawgs are. 
Theiio two people will be the proud 
recipients of tickets to Military 
Ball. .SCABBARD and BLADE is 
donating two tickets—ouch good 
for one couple. So come and get., 
’em.
Free Food, Too!
Here we go again. What is u 
tea dance? So, in answer to that 
the Coca-Cola Company will, give 
away free cokes—oh, excuse us—< 
free . Coca Colas. And any day 
now comes notice that the Broiled 
Bacon Company of Baked Bean, 
Boston, is providing T.I.C. with 
sliced tomatoes and lettuce—on 
toast.
Seriously, though, FRANK and 
SEDER’S and the TARTAN have 
done their darndest to make this 
•a real whopperoo of an affair, 
and all you have to do is come to 
the Gym on Friday at 4:30 and 
relax. The models, whose pictures

Rev. Wm. F. Orr 
Engaged to Speak 
At Chapel Today
Chapel will be held today in the 
Theater, College of Fine Arts. Rev. 
William F. Orr, of the Western 
Theological Seminary, has been 
engaged as the speaker. His topic 
is “Religion and Its Effect on the 
Present Generation.”
As usual the chapel choir will 
sing, the main song being “Lo, My 
Shepherd’s Hand,” by Franz Jo­
seph Haydn. The audience will 
be asked to join in the singing.
Rev. Orr’s southern accent is 
the result of his attending high 
school and Southwestern College 
in Memphis. He was also a stu­
dent at theological school in Ken­
tucky and the theological semin­
ary at Hartford, Connecticut. Rev. 
Orr is probably already known 
to Carnegie students as the leader 
of the discussion groups on Thurs­
day nights in the Union.

Hicks, Norman Thomas and Rob­

um this year to present speakers 
having opposing viewpoints in 
successive lectures. Thus all sides 
of an issue are presented fairly to 
the listener.
Next Monday at 8:15 Maynard 
C. Krueger, Socialist Vice-Presi- 
dential nominee will lead a dis­
cussion on “Democracy on the De­
fensive.” On the following Mon­
day evening, November 11, Ernest 
Stacey Griffith will attempt to 
correlate the various implications 
of the present political campaign.
In the Community Forum lies 
the opportunity to realize the prin­
ciple of “freedom of speech and 
assembly.” So “taken for grant­

its value is only realized now 
when powerful forces threaten to 
destroy it.

Telephone men 
know this piece of apparatus as the 108-A 
Amplifier. It is an ''exploring amplifier,” 
developed by Bell System engineers to iden­
tify pairs of wires in telephone cables—some 
of which contain as many as 4242 wires.
The cable man explores this mass of wires 
with the pencil-like probe. A tone sounding 
in the headphone tells him when he has 
found the right pair.
Ingenuity—special equipment—attention 
to details—play an important part in mak­
ing your telephone service the clearest and 
fastest in the world.
Teeh-fn-color Tartan Friday
If you haven’t been completely asleep, you know that Tech-in- 
color is here—or rather that it will be here on Friday. TAUT AN 
is rather proud of its association with this colossal gigantic spec­
tacle. By way of pinning a medal on our chest, we are going to 
have a special issue on Friday.
The extra issue has another significance. A regular two-a- 
week policy seems financially out of the question. As an alterna­
tive TARTAN plans to have special issues for special occasions.
Proposed Vacation Change
Vacations and examinations are the high, spots in four years 
oi! college—and vacations are the pleasanter.
Suspension of classes means a rest and a good time to local 
students and perhaps a chance to replenish financial resources 
with a few days’ work.
To the out-of-town student recess is a great deal more im­
portant; it means an opportunity to go home, to see old friends, 
and to apologize to people for not having written letters the rest 
of the year.
That is why some students go home even during the cramped 
Thanksgiving recess. That is why it is hard to understand why 
the Administration decided at the last minute to put Thanksgiving 
closer to Christmas. Last year’s arrangement is much to be 
preferred.
It may be too late to do anything about Thanksgiving, but per­
haps Christmas recess can still be adjusted.
Going back to classes after several days of freedom is always 
a chore. It is especially so when it means cutting into a happy 
New Year’s Eve.. As the calendar now stands, classes resume on 
January 2. That works to the disadvantage of the student who 
lives out of town. He has the choice between a quiet New Year’s 
Eve at home or a long train ride with a hangover.
An extra day at the end of the Christmas recess would make 
the holiday many times more pleasant for those who have to con­
sider hours of traveling in their time-budget.
Where that day is to come from is a technical question. It 
might come from the recess between semesters, or it might be 
added at the end of the school year. Perhaps the easiest solution 
would be to take the day from the beginning of the recess and add 
it at the end.
In the interests of the out-of-town student the matter de­
serves some attention. The Administration would probably make 
the necessary adjustment if the recommendation were made 
through a student petition or a resolution by Student Council.
Pennsylvania Censorship
The Pennsylvania Board of Censors is setting a standard for 
bigotry and narrowmindedness which is almost impossible to 
believe.
Aside from the numerous cases in which the Board found 
some sex hint from which it felt it necessary to protect the pub­
lic, there are many cases of moving pictures barred on purely 
political grounds.
A few weeks ago il; was “The Ramparts We Watch,” a March 
of Time feature dealing with the European War and the defense 
plans of the IJ. 8. government. The picture happens to be in the 
usual flag-waving, scare-throwing pro-conscription tradition of 
the Time organization. As a matter of fact it was part of the 
propaganda campaign to sell conscription to the American people. 
We don't like it. But it is rather presumptuous of these gentlemen 
to tell us that because (lie picture included scenes of the Nazi 
invasion of Poland we would not be permitted to see it.
More recently the Board has banned "The World in Flames,” 
a compilation of newsreel shots describing the events that led up 
to the present war. The reason given was that it lias “a ten­
dency to corrupt, and debase morals.” In answer to the Penn­
sylvania Board of Censors, the New York Times said: “That is a 
ridiculous charge- unless, ol! course, it implies that the evidences 
o.l! human greed, brutality and hatred which the past ten years 
have turned up are demoralizing. And all the censor boards in 
Christendom can do nothing to hide that monstrous shame. The 
world'is in flumes primarily because of it.”

Engineers Tour
Fourteen Carnegie senior Civil 
Engineers, accompanied by Dr. 
Gerard A. Rohlich, took a trip 
through the midwest during the 
week of October 16-23. Stops on 
the itinerary included Cincinnati, 
South Bend and Chicago.
Leaving Pittsburgh Wednesday, 
October 16, the Civils spent two 
days at the annual meeting of 
the American Society of Civil En­
gineers in Cincinnati. Besides at­
tending the meetings, they made 
a tour of Cincinnati’s water filtra­
tion plant.
Loran D. Gayton, chief engin­
eer of the City of Chicago, en­
tertained the Carnegie students 
on Tuesday afternoon. Luncheon 
that day, at the Chicago Engin­
eers’ Club, presented many valu­
able contacts with eminent mid­
west engineers. The Bascule 
bridge was operated especially for 
the group, and the bridge’s con­
struction was thoroughly explain­
ed.

TUESDAY; OCTOBER 29, 1940THE CABNEGIE TARTANS
HATS OFF TOCarnegie Defeats 
Case Eleven, 14-0THISTLEDOWN
TARTANS SCORE SECOND VICTORYgnme this year, making several 
thilling broken-field runs and nice 
punts. Tony Laposlci scored both 
touchdowns, once on a short pass 
from Jordano and a short dash 
down the sidelines and again on 
a plunge through the center.
This coming Saturday the Sld- 
bo eleven will meet the Bearcats 
of Cincinnati at the Bearcat’s 
home field. It promises to be a 
very good game with a rejuvenat­
ed Tech team meeting iv well sea­
soned eleven of veterans. The 
Bearcats have played six of their 
nine games and have a .500 aver­
age, winning from Hanover, the 
University of Louisville, and Cen­
tre College. The defeats have been 
suffered at the hands of Navy, 
Boston U., and the University of 
Dayton.
Cincinnati plays a wide open 
brand of ball, using the Notre 
Dame system with variations. 
They are coached by Joe Meyer 
who is a Notre Dame graduate, 
class of 1919, and should provide 
some stiff competition for the Tar­
tans.
Jiejom Line-up; 
Jordano Stars
Following the bad defeat at the 
hands of Notre Dame two weeks 
ago, the Carnegie Tartans bounced 
back to a decisive victory on their 
home field. The Case Scientists 
were the victims to the tune of 
14-0, but the score should have 
been higher since several touch­
downs were lost due to the breaks 
of the game. Several of the play­
ers say that the touchdown that 
was lost by inches was really over 
the last white line but that La- 
poski was pushed back and the 
referee did not notice it.
The team was playing much 
better than in any game as yet this 
season, especially the line. The 
blocking was very good and it is 
hoped that it will continue for the 
remainder of the season. Ted 
Fisher and Bob Church were both 
back in harness at the opening gun 
after partially recovering from 
their bad injuries. Chuck Rader 
took the injured Muha’s place at 
right hali and did a very fine piece 
of work the entire afternoon. 
Frank Jordano played his best
__________; By Bill Floyd, Sports Editor ----------------
Skibos Show Real Power
Last Saturday, for the first time before the eyes of their fol­
lowers did Doc Baker’s pupils show what a good ball club they 
really can be. For the entire game the blocking was that of a 
true Class A team, and the backfield men were running in a style 
that would make any coach proud of his handiwork.
Foremost in this group of hard running backfield aces was 
Frank Jordano, who for the first time this season started to run 
like an All-American candidate. Not even Frankie will deny the 
fact that large holes were being blown in the Scientist’s line by 
the Tartan lineman, but once young Frankie got in the Casites’ 
backyard the men from Cleveland had their hands full holding 
our man. Tony Laposki, Chuck Rader, and Paul Friedlander also 
made a deep impression upon the men of Case, for their hard run­
ning and vicious blocking were stepping stones toward this sorely 
needed victory.
Big George Returns
One of the more pleasant sights of this past game was the 
brief return to the lineup of George Muha. After the Notre Dame 
game and during the past' week many stories were circulated as to 
the extent of George’s shoulder injury, however, it is now being 
substantiated that George suffered several torn muscles in his 
left shoulder. Although this is a painful and annoying infliction 
it is one that will heal rapidly and will not keep George from 
entering into coming football contests.
Joe Wasn’t There
One football player that was missed by those who attended 
the game was Joe Betz, for Joe was lying on his back in his room 
in the Presbyterian Hospital. During the Notre Dame game Joe 
was carried off the field with a badly twisted knee, and although 
this injury will repair itself in time, Master Betz is destined to 
spend more than a few days in bed. May we suggest that any 
one of the 2,100 students in Carnegie Tech, who has a few spare 
moments, take a trip to room 752 in the hospital on the hill, and at 
least say hello to one of the best boys ever to enter our school. 
Women’s Rifle Team Discontinued
Word has just come from Sergeant Sommer, coach of both 
the men’s and women’s rifle squads, that due to lack of funds the 
women’s rifle team for the coming year has been discontinued. In 
past seasons too few women have entered into this school activity 
to make it advantageous for the school to apportion the money 
needed for its existence. The sorrowful part of this lack of funds 
is that Carnegie women have held, for many years, an enviable 
spot in the listing of Women’s Rifle Teams all over the nation. 
The height of this series of notable markswomen was reached 
last year when Rosemary Novae took top honors in the Women’s 
Intercollegiate Rifle Matches.
. . . Frank Jordano (left) and Peter Dobrus (right), who upheld the 
colors of Carnegie Tech by leading tlie fighting Skibos to an impres­
sive victory over Case on Saturday. Jordano’s running and Dobrus’ 
tackling were highlights of this battle.
Pitt Harriers 
Wallop Tech 
Through Error
Last Saturday the Tech cross­
country squad was scheduled to 
meet the Pitt “B” team. Pitt “B” 
is more or less of a reserve team 
and is separate from the varsity 
harriers. Since Pitt has a large 
and powerful varsity squad and 
Tech’s team has not the talent to 
meet such a versatile team, Tech 
has always been scheduled to 
meet the “B” team. But who 
should show up Saturday but the 
powerful Pitt varsity. Coach Guy 
Halferty, however, said that all in 
all it turned out to be a good 
thing, because, although Tech was 
swamped by a score of 15 to 40, 
the boys ran better than in the 
race last week. They all stayed 
in there and did their best all the 
way.
The full Pitt team which con­
sists of five men finished ahead of 
Tech. Pitt’s first man to finish was 
Steamer and Tech’s first man was 
Marcin.
DU’s Win, 33-0; 
Gain Berth 
In Play-Offs
Tartan Plebes 
Suffer Defeat 
At Kiski Prep
Last Friday Kiski Prep school 
defeated the Tech Plebes by a 
score of 20-0. Strange as it may 
seem all three touchdowns and 
two conversions were made in the 
first period, the proteges of. Jim 
Marks scoring on their first of­
fensive play. Just as easily came 
the second tally, the third being 
made after a long sustained drive 
which found the Klskites blocking 
and driving their way from the 
Tech forty yard line. In the re­
maining periods the Skibos gath­
ered their wits about them and 
showed fine power and attack but 
they were unable to find a scor­
ing punch. Although lacking in 
experience the Tartans never lost 
their fight,
Delta Upsilon became the first 
squad to qualify for the play-offs 
in the intramural touch football 
toumey when they soundly 
trounced the Electrical Engineers, 
last Wednesday, 33-0. The deci­
sive victory of the fraternity men 
was unexpected, considering the 
fact that the Engineers naa pre­
viously boasted wins over the 
Theta Xi and “Flea” aggregations.
The DU’s offense, sparked by 
the fast stepping of Cy Herre and 
the hard charging of George 
I-Iobbs, clicked to perfection 
throughout the fray. They now 
have earned triumphs over Welch, 
Citcom Clan, and the Electricals, 
and enter the finals as reigning 
favorites to take the crown.
At this writing four other teams, 
the Junior Metallurgists, ATOs, 
Delts, and Kappa Sigs, are still in 
the running.
Soccer Squad 
Beat by Gators
Last Friday afternoon the Tar­
tan soccer squad suffered a defeat 
at the hands of Slippery Rock 
State Teachers College who scor­
ed a point in the second quarter 
and another in the fourth. Al­
though the Skibos played a good 
game, they certainly wero not at 
their best; they just didn’t seem to 
be clicking. Twice the Tartans 
booted toward the goal and Iho 
ball bounced off the uprights, thus 
falling to score. One of Tech’s 
outstanding players was White, the 
center half-back. On the whole it 
was a hard fought game with both 
sides congratulating each other at 
the finish.
Sports Writers 
Receive Letters
In THE CARNEGIE TARTAN 
of October 22, 1940, the editor, in 
view of certain athletic circum­
stances, asked for letters from stu­
dents, and especially from those 
who could speak authoritatively 
on the subject, giving their re­
spective viewpoints concerning 
the football schedule and the many 
complications of the football plan. 
Interest in this subject was im­
mediately shown, and pertinent 
statements were expressed. The 
TARTAN was the recipient of 
many letters and comments, the 
more interesting and conclusive of 
these being slated for printing in 
coming editions. Perhaps the most 
instructive letter received came 
from the Department of Inter­
collegiate Athletics, and was sign­
ed by Clarence Overend. Due to 
the cutting down oi the size of the 
TARTAN and the issuing of two 
papers per week, there was no 
room for any letters in this first 
issue, but in forthcoming editions 
the staff will make every effort 
to run as many letters of import­
ance as possible.

For Continued Use 
Of Pool Facilities
Few Students 
Show Interest 
in Swimming
The end of Summer and the be­
ginning of Autumn is certainly no 
indication that swimming should 
cease altogether. The absence oJ! 
solar rays should not prevent the 
student from indulging in a bit 
of aquatic exercise.
. So here at Tech our student 
council has asked for, and gotten, 
the privilege of continuing a sum­
mer custom by making available 
to everyone of you the facilities 
of the school’s swimming pool 
and dressing rooms.
From the apparent lack of in­
terest shown by the small attend­
ance, you are not taking advant­
age of this privilege. For this rea­
son swimming will be discontin­
ued unless more studients aire 
present.
Official announcements have 
been placed on the bulletin boards 
in all schools. In addition the 
Plaid has printed another an­
nouncement in this column.
To repeat,, the swimming hours 
are:
Wed. 6:45-11:00 for a mixed 
swimming group.
Fri., 6:45-11:00 for men only.
Entrance to the dressing rooms 
is through the middle doors Cor 
the men and through tTie lower 
doors for the women. Coach Frank 
Moses is in charge. Several in­
structors are present who teach 
the essentials to those who don’t 
know how and to those who feel 
they can show improvement.
The partaking of exercise is 
just one part of the swimming 
get-together. At the pool the stu­
dent has the opportunity to meet 
others, to extend his acquaintance­
ship with fellow students outside 
his classes.

First Dance 
Is Successful
Merry-making and gaiety were 
hand in hand when the Evening 
College of Industries held its an­
nual Hallowe'en dance in the gym­
nasium last Saturday evening 
from nine 'til twelve.
Able hosts presented lovely 
nosegays of fall pompoms and 
novel programs with Hallowe’en 
colors to the first 200 couples. Due 
to their limited number, many late 
arrivals were disappointed, but the 
more fortunate ones had a worth­
while remembrance of a lovely 
evening.
Decorations were typical of the 
Hallowe’en season. Cornstalks 
guarded the dark corners; witches, 
goblins, black cats, pumpkins, 
black and orange streamers en­
livened the walls; wierd lighting 
effects, created by the spots, add­
ed to these decorations; and the 
crystal ball turned endlessly oil 
its pivot.
Excellent melodies were pro­
vided by Mickey Ross and his or­
chestra, a new band on the cam­
pus. He was the former vocalist 
with Baron Elliot’s orchestra and 
has a style similar to Orin Tucker. 
His waltzes and rumbas will not 
be soon forgotten by all those who 
danced.
Attendance was not limited to 
the College of Industries and Mar­
garet Morrison. Other college 
groups in large number wire well 
represented.
The Black Cat, which is located 
under Thistle Hall, whose decora­
tions are always suggestive of Hal­
lowe’en, entertained the joyous 
throng with light refreshments.
Official hosts included both last 
year's officers, Russell Stroschein, 
Joseph Gumma, Margaret Scott, 
and Nicholas Rollinger, and mem­
bers of this year’s council, Pete 
Rollinger, Ed Tiepel, Eleanor Gor­
sky, and Frank Carlos.

Come along with me
To my home by the sea;
Near a sandy beach 
Where the sea gulls screech.
I’ll show you the sight
Of sail boat’s white,
As she makes her w'ay 
Down across the bay.
And we’ll sail around
To a spot I’ve found,
Where the sea bass bite 
In the day or night.
Then we’ll drift at ease
Through the quiet seas,
While white clouds race by 
In a blue, sunny sky.

Student Council
The last regularly scheduled 
meeting of the 1939-1940 Evening 
Student Council was held in Car­
negie Union, Sunday afternoon, 
October 6. 1940.
The budget committee met prior 
to the meeting to check the treas­
urer’s books, which were found 
to be in good order.
President Marcinizyn reported 
that approval of the Dr. Baker 
Memorial has been obtained from, 
the Administration and that the 
Memorial and marble had been 
turned over to them for installa­
tion in Administration Hall.
Much discussion resulted over 
the desire of the joint purchase of 
a Public Address System by the 
Day and Evening Student Council 
for use by both groups during 
Council functions on the campus. 
This seemed to be a fine opportun­
ity for the beginning of coopera­
tion and a better understanding 
between the groups. Resulting ac­
tion was the appointment of a 
committee to meet with the Day 
Student Council Committee to 
work out details and check on in­
cidents that could help in bring­
ing the councils closer together.
Changes and additions in the 
General Rules and By Laws were 
read (find approved by Council. 
Many of these new . changes al­
ready appear in this year’s Hand­
book.
It was brought to the Council’s 
attention that there is a need for 
a good study-room in Industries 
Building, there being a lack of 
sufficient table space and poor 
light in the old Christian Room 
that is now used.,

LETTER TO THE EDITOR . . . .
Noting the letter which appear­
ed in last week’s Plaid, to which I 
give heartiest accord, I recalled 
another sterling character who 
left the school at the end of his 
Council presidency year, about 
1937—William G. Moles, or Bill 
Moles as he is probably better 
known.
Here was the man who really 
used the Big Stick instead of just 
talking about it, and this was the 
man who forged people containing 
worthwhile qualities into friends 
who will endure to doomsday and 
beyond. He made enemies too 
(what real person has not?) but 
he did that only because nothing 
ever blocked his determined 
march toward the correct and 
proper conduct of those matters 
entrusted to his care by the stu­
dent body. That he has magnetic 
personality is shown by the way 
his acquaintances ask about him 
almost nightly at Carnegie Tech. 
Incidentally, the special Council 
meetings he called were the dread 
of his Council members, but they 
were probably necessary.
Do you suppose that night 
school is unusually fortunate in 
meeting such men, or might it be 
that the night school molds them?
ANOTHER NIGHT MAN.
From the amount of ballots cast 
at our evening school elections it 
appears that the greater portion 
of the student body have little in­
terest in the importance of the 
Evening Student Council. In the 
College of Fine Arts 57 ballots 
were cast from an eligible 485 
electors, 97 voters . out of 1329 
electors in Industries, and 103 out 
of 1167 in Engineering. In spite of
Each year, at college election 
time, the various groups on the 
evening school campus are faced 
with a very definite shortage of 
eligible candidates for office. As a 
result of this condition there were 
several cases where only one man 
was nominated for a position, this 
making unnecessary an official 
election. To many of you who at­
tended the smokers it may have 
appeared that the elections were 
fixed, as a matter of fact, that 
statement was voiced by a mem­
ber of the one of the groups. But 
when the presiding officer asked 
those who were eligible to hold 
office to stand only two or more 
than were nominated stood up, 
and of those two, one held a coun­
cil office while the other was un­
able to run because of the size of 
his schedule.
It is extremely hard to under­
stand such lack of interest on the 
part of the students. The election 
smokers, themselves, are a further 
example of this lack. Only about 
two hundred students come out to 
elect officers to govern about two 
thousand. Perhaps some of you 
fail to realize the value of the 
conditions here at Tech. Our form 
of student government is one of 
the finest of any similar college 
group, either day or night, 
throughout the country. Business 
matters are handled in a business 
like manner, and student prob­
lems are given prompt atention.
Driving?
Parking’s Easy If 
You Know Where—
What to do! Five minutes until 
class time, and I can’t find a place 
to park this car. How many times 
have you been in this predica­
ment? With winter coming on, the 
closer to the school you can pai'lc 
the better it will be.
Engineers have studied the 
parking problem and have marked 
the streets to make ample room 
for any make of car, so when 
parking keep within the space al­
lotted for you and don’t infringe 
on other people’s space.
The school has provided parking 
lots for the convenience of the 
students namely—two parking 
spaces in back of the Engineering 
Building and one on Margaret 
Morrison Street in back of the 
Faculty houses.
These facilities are for your con­
venience, so make use of them.
these figures, every year there are 
many complaints on the way 
Council has functioned. If you 
wish to complain, why don’t you 
attend the election parties and 
exercise your power to vote.
The Evening Student Council 
was formed in 1924 by the con­
sent of 51 per cent of the student 
enrollment. This group deemed it 
necessary to have an organization 
to carry out the evening school 
affairs, business matters, and a 
central organization to deal with 
problems concerning the whole 
school, as well as those of indi­
vidual groups.
There are 15 dances, 3 election 
parties, and the Engineers’ Ban­
quet sponsored by Student Coun­
cil. The Carnegie Plaid and the 
Evening Student Handbook also 
are published from Council funds. 
Last year over $6,000.00 of student 
business was transacted by 
Council. This is student money, 
you pay it, and I can’t see why 
you don’t have an interest in how 
it is spent.
The Evening Student Council 
does more than spend money. 
Every year it meets with the Ad­
ministrative Faculty to discuss 
your problems; such as lighting, 
instructors, and to bring a closer 
understanding between the facul­
ty and the student body.
The Evening Student Council 
works for you, so let them have 
your support. This year President 
James Fisher will have to work 
with almost an entirely new Coun­
cil. This will be a difficult task 
and he will need all the support 
that he can obtain.

In spite of the haphazard support 
of the students, Council has func­
tioned as a highly cooperative 
governing agent.
Evening students here at Tech 
should be very proud of this sys­
tem and very ashamed of them­
selves for their lack of interest. 
Your student government is a 
form of insurance and you are the 
direct beneficiaries, but on this, 
as on any other insurance policy 
you must pay a premium, which 
in this case is small,, just your 
whole hearted support.
Everyone who is registered in 
the evening school is a potential 
office holder. The only require­
ments-of eligibility, are a Student 
Council Insignia Key, a passing 
average in your studies and four 
attendance hours each week.
Assuming that all of you have 
the necessary scholastic standing 
all you need do is win your key. 
You can do that by coming out to 
work at any council or college 
sponsored event or project. You 
can make posters, decorate, or 
write for the Plaid. Your student 
handbooks will give you a de­
tailed outline of the point system.
No chain is any stronger than 
its weakest link, and at the pres­
ent time, student support is the 
weak spot in the evening group. 
So let’s see a lot of you come out 
this year and pile up points for 
your key. Every man or woman 
who comes out to work or vote is 
helping to build a new and strong­
er chain—one which will be cap­
able of holding in check all the 
problems the future may hold.

Individual Reading 
Analysis Offered
Doctor Roscoe M. Ihrig, Director 
of Evening Courses, has called 
attention to the fact that a unique 
service is now being made avail­
able to evening students of the' 
Department of Psychology and 
Education. Doctor Robert G. 
Simpson of that Department is of­
fering to these students consulta­
tion on remedial reading and is 
in his office and laboratory, Room 
253-B, Industries Building, every 
Friday evening, 6:30 to 8:30.
While this service has been 
available for day students for sev­
eral years’ time, and has proved 
enlirely successful, it was not for­
merly offered to evening students. 
However, Doctor Simpson is now 
offering it to the evening students 
of that department also, on an ex­
perimental basis, in an effort to 
aid those who feel the need of as­
sistance.
This is a noteworthy service 
which Doctor Simpson is perform­
ing in giving his valuable time for 
consultation over the students’ 
reading and studying faults, and 
the fact that this service is one 
that is highly sought by evening 
students in many other courses as 
well as in other schools should 
urge appreciation by the Psychol­
ogy and Education students here.
Doctor Simpson will welcome 
evening students to these consul­
tation periods, and by their .at­
tendance they can show apprecia­
tion of his generosity.
