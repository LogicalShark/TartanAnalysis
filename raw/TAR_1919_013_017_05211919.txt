THE TRIALS OF A SCIENCE FRESHMAN
My landlady has a niece. Not a very 
¦extraordinary accomplishment in it­
self, perhaps; lots of people have 
them. My sister tells me that her. 
Uncle Joe has not merely one niece, 
Imt two, and a couple of nephews to 
boot. Nor can any one be readily 
condemned for the possession of a 
niece; they are acquired when very 
young, and often without notice; a 
brother or sister of the recipient of 
the new relative usually being aware 
of the existence of the niece long be­
fore------.
But I wander. My landlady, as I re- 
marke'd, has a niece, and any person, 
regardless of age sex, or previous 
condition of servitude, is legally en­
titled to such a possession. I have 
never met my landlady’s niece; she

M. M. D. HOLDS INTERESTING ASSEMBLY
The M. M.- Assembly on Wednesday, 
May 14, was addressed by Rabbi 
Goldenson, and those present enjoyed 
not only his lecture but his very 
pleasing personality and the character 
of his voice and delivery.
He took for his topic “The Interna­
tional Mind,” and presented some 
familiar facts in a new light. The 
four influences of our everyday life, 
which he showed to be primarily inter­
national in their nature, are facts, cul­
ture, education and religion.
The most striking illustration he 
employed was the fact that every meal 
we sit down to, no matter how simple, 
is international in character, if we 
examine it carefully enough.
Applying these observations to the 
League of Nations, we can see that 
men 1 of today should be naturally 
equipped to attain an international 
point of view and overcome the na­
tionalism,. provincialism and individ­
ualism, that has so hemmed them in 
heretofore.

DANCE TUESDAY, MAY 27
The Design School Scholarship 
dance is to be held Tuesday. May 27— 
Union—Ollie Riehl—Orchestra. This 
dance is being given on account of the 
great need for a fund in Design 
School which the faculty can call on 
for needy, worthy students. The De­
sign Scholarship dance is not a new 
thing at Carnegie Tech and some of 
the older students well remember the 
good time it always afforded. The De. 
sign Scholarship dance is now a part 
of the Tech program after an absence 
of two years. We sincerely hope that 
all the students of Tech will do all 
they can to help the fund, as we ex­
pect to be able to help soldiers who 
answered the call of arms, and who 
now. that the war, is gloriously over, 
do not find themselves in the same 
circumstances'as when they left arid 
are unable to fallow out their natural 
talent. There are also two other very 
good reasons why you should be there. 
The music is to be the best and the 
Punch is going to walk from Design 
to the Union.
DON’T BE DEAD
“Say. didn’t see you at the baseball 
game yesterday.”
i “Wasn’t there; couldn’t get around.” 
| "What were you doing?”
1 “Oh. nothing special; just couldn’t 
come.”
Such a conversation takes place loo 
many times around Tech. The old- 
'tiine spirit seems to be lacking. The 
students do not take interest in the 
games or in any other activity that 
takes place. At the baseball games, 
for instance, only one corner of the 
stand is filled when the whole place 
should be crowded. “Didn’t know 
about it,” is a favorite excuse. Well, 
find out about it. Notices of all events 
are put up on the bulletin boards in 
time for every one to bo ready ’ for 
them. The baseball and track no­
tices are all over the campus long be­
fore the event takes place. Another 
favorite stall -is four-thirty classes. 
Come around at four-thirty and you 
will only miss about two innings. If 
you have a five-thirty class come

BR. BLENINGER TO TALK TO CHEMISTS THURSDAY EVENING
WESTMINSTER HOODOO AS YET UNDECIDED
P. T. OR NOT P. T,THAT IS THE QUESTION
One of the biggest jobs around Sci­
ence School is to keep up to date on 
the P. T. question. Nobody knows, 
quite, what is going on or exactly 
what he wants along that line, al­
though there are many who are 
against it in any form. On Monday, 
May 12, a meeting was held in which 
it.was decided to sign a resolution 
that until the old two-hour system 
was established, there would be no 
P. T. On Tuesday, the resolution was 
circulated and signed by most of the 
students,’ and on Wednesday only 
about ten appeared for P. T. At assem­
bly on Wednesday, President Ham- 
erschlag discussed the question with 
the students, and as a result the strike 
resolution was withdrawn, and it was 
decided to appoint a committee to 
investigate the matter and bring up 
a plan, approved by the students, to 
the administration. On Friday the 
committee reported a plan which in­
cluded three hours of P. T. a week, 
Saturday classes and school closing 
July first (with the saloons), thus cut­
ting off two weeks. As yet the approv­
al of the administration is to bo 
sought. Let us hope that the P. T. 
question Avili be settled this semester.

NEW PETITION AND POSSIBLE SCHEDULE
At a mass meeting, Friday after­
noon, the following petition was read 
to the students, who decided by an 
almost unanimous vote to show their 
approval of it:
To the Faculty,
Division of Engineering and Sci­
ence:
A committee of the Science Senate, 
consisting of P. IT. Armor, chairman; 
P. S. Miller, J. F. G iff on, C. B. 
Schmidt and IT. D. Sklrniy after a 
conference with President Hamer* 
schlag, Dean Tarbell and the mem­
bers of the Department of Physical 
Education, wish to present to the fac­
ulty of the Division of Engineering 
and Science the following plan for 
'their consideration:
In view of the fact, that prosont. 
plans for the remainder of the school 
year involve the continuation of 
classes until July 13, we wish to sug­
gest that an effort be made to shorten 
the'term so that is will not extend be­
yond the third of July. Provided the 
faculty should be ablo to change the 
present schedule, this docreaso In 
time might be made up in two ways. 
First, additional classes might bo

PIT! EASY VICTIM IN TENNIS
Smith Saves Pitt From Whitewash
The baseball game between Tech 
and Westminster, that had been post­
poned twice on account of inclement 
weather, began yesterday in spite of 
the overcast sky, and threatening 
clouds. After an inning and a half, 
rain again put an end to the fracas, 
so the game was again postponed. 
However, for the inning and a half the 
game was for blood and a hitting bee 
started. Westminster scored a run in 
their half of the first inning by a com­
bination of walks and hits and the 
side was retired. Tech came up with 
blood in t'heir eye. Ray Doherty 
singled to right, Cates went to first on 
"being hit by a pitched ball, Captain 
Gretzler lammed out a two-bagger that 
brought in Doherty and Cates. “Windy” 
Lynn then smacked the ball on the 
nose for a beautiful triple, bringing in

Dr. A. V. Bleininger of the Bureau 
of Standards will address the. Chem­
ists’ Club on “Principles of ‘Some 
Fundamental Processes in Ceramics,” 
on Thursday evening. Dr. Bleininger 
is one of the most noted ceramic en­
gineers in the country, and is a very 
interesting speaker.
The scope of the subject is such as 
to be of value to anyone interested in 
technical matters. The speaker has 
¦written a number of papers for the 
Bureau of Standards, concerning the 
relation of clay refractories to metal­
lurgical, chemical and mechanical en­
gineering.
Everyone is invited to hear the lec­
ture which will begin at 8 o'clock in

IMPORTANT SCIENCE SENATE MEETING HELD
Tech emerged victorious in a hard 
foug'ht tennis match with Pitt last 
week at the Pittsburgh Athletic Asso- 
elation courts. The fact that Smith 
of Pitt, won the nrst singles was all 
that saved Pitt from a complete 
whitewash, as the final score was 5 
to 1. Captain Beatty of Tech was 
bested in this first set by Smith. 
Stockslager, Cawt'hrop and Copley of 
Tech all won their singles handily, 
while Tech also collected both dou­
ble sets. The score by sets:
Singles.
Tech—Beatty .................................2—7—4
Pitt—Smith .....................................G—3—6
Tech—Stockslager .........1............................. 6—6.
Pitt—Scheerls ................................ 0—4
Tech—Cawthrop ........................... 6—6
Pitt—Merritt .................................. 4—2
Tech—Copley ................................. G—6
Pitt—Campbell .............................. 4—4
Doubles.
Tedh.—Beatty and Stockslager.. .6—6
Pitt—Smith and Merritt...................3—3
Tech—Cawthrop and Copley.........7—6
Pitt—Lewis and Munk.....................5—3
This was Tech’s first game' of the 
season and was scheduled for Tues­
day on Tech courts beside the 
Science building, but the condition of 
the weather and the grounds made it 
necessary to postpone the contest un­
til yesterday. The game was sched­
uled for eleven o’clock and both 
teams were a little late in starting, 
but when they got under way the 
singles were played off rapidly and 
the serious work of the doubles be­
gan. Tech won by superior team 
work in the doubles and the individ­
ual playing of Stockslager, Cawthrop 
and Copley in the singles. Captain
Beatty was matched against Smith of 
Pitt, who was oasily Who star of the 
Pitt aggregation and as shown In 
the score made the Pitt man step to 
boat him. This afternoon Toch Cross* 
es racquets with Washington and 
Jefferson at the Tech courts and the 
Washington boys are a very speedy 
set of lad,s so Tech will not have 
much trme to loaf. Today’s match 
will occur on the Tech courts. On 
Saturday Tech and W. &. J. will give 
a return performance, at Washington.
The Tech tennis squad is under the 
coaching of Colonel John C. W. 
Brooks, the head of the Military Di 
vision of the Institute. The Colonel 
himself, aLthough a veteran in point 
of service is practically an unbeaten 
champion tennis player of the army. 
He entered West Point in 1881 and 
graduated in 1885 and has been as­
signed to the various forts of Uncle 
Sam’s realm all the way from New­
port News to San Francisco. As a 
young man the Colonel took up ten­
nis playing and to see him skipping 
around a court it is Tiard to believe 
that he is a war veteran retired after 
30 years’ service. When the war 
broke out, although he was already a 
veteran of the Indian, Cuban and 
Philippine campaigns, the Colonel 
volunteered for active duty and was 
put in charge of the Military Divi­
sion at Tech.
Captain Beatty is the strongest of 
t*he Techites and with a peculiar turn 
of luck was the only Tech player de­
feated in the Pitt singles, being op­
posed to Smith, the strongest and 
speediest of the Pitt team. He is a 
(Continued on Page Four,)
Next Friday afternoon on the Mel­
lon Hall lawn, the girls of the M. 
M. D.. will give their annual May 
Day fete. Various dances will bo 
featured and every girl of the whole 
M. M. D. will take part. Certainly 
it will be worth seeing and any one 
who has ever seen it will agree that! 
it is time well spent.
This is the crowning effort of the 
Girls’ Athletic Association and since j 
the men ask and receive such good 
support on the part of the young 
ladies, it Is only fair that we give) 
as much. The program was printed 
in last week’s issue and the names 
of the various dances may be seen 
there. It is a varied and well ar­
ranged program and 'the young ladies 
are working hard to make it a ban­
ner number.
The Freshmen and Sophomore class j 
members who have never witnessed j 
this fete should make a double effort I
to attend. If the weather is propiti­
ous, como, you will bo' well pleased.
TENNIS DANCE IN UNION
To complete the program for 'the 
day the tennis dance will bo the clos- 
niimber.
As announced in last week's Tar­
tan, the second- and last tennis danco 
will be held Friday, May 23, in the 
Union. The orchestra which furnish­
ed tho music for the first tennis 
dance will play for 'tho coming 
dance.
After Tech’s fine display of tennis 
in walloping Pitt in last week's match, 
renewed' Interest lias boon shown Im 
the tennis team. Judging from the 
demand for tickets, a fine danco is 
expected by Che »Indents, and from 
the arrangements made by the man­
agement, their expectations are to bo 
fulfilled.
TECH QUADRUPLES QUOTA
TO FIFTH LIBERTY LOAN
According to the latest available 
figures Tech has nearly quadrupled 
her quota in tho Victory Loan. Dur­
ing the Fourth Loan Tocli's quota was 
placed at $28,ORO. Tills figuro was as­
signed to the institution for the Vic­
tory Loan, but the Loan Commlttoo 
got togelhor and voluntarily increased 
the quota to $30,000. So far tho Tech 
Committee, headed by Miss Ethel 
Sturtevant, head of the Department of 
Secretarial Studies In the Margaret 
Morrison Division, reports that Tech 
has subscribed $10(5,1)00 to Ilio Victory 
Loan.
Miss TTormlne Sehwed of New York 
City, who Is connected wit h I he War 
Camp Community Service, was a 
visitor at the Margaret Morrison Di­
vision this week.
Rabbi Dr. S. il. Goldman of tho 
Rodei! Sliolom Synagogue, Pittsburgh, 
«poke on WodneMday at, the Margaret 
Morrison Division on “Tho interna­
tional Mind.”
TECH WINS A TWO HONOR STAR FLAG
A splendid and practical tribute was 
paid by Tech to her returning heroes, 
and all other brave soldiers who 
fought for the Ideals of humanity, 
when she went over the top three 
times. Tech Is now entitled to a flag 
displaying two honor stars, one for 
each tlmo tin« quota, $2,81)1», was re­
peated. The far-away goal finally 
reached was $10(1,1)00. It Is a strange 
ly appropriate coincidence that this 
groat victory of dollars was won tho 
very week that the 15th Engineers re­
turned. Toch knows how to back up 
her cheers with dollars!
To the Secretarial Department of 
the Margaret Morrison Division, who 
launched and directed the Victory 
Loan throughout Tech, particularly to 
Miss Ethel Sturtevant, head of the 
Department, who bore tho whole re­
sponsibility of success or failure, cred­
it is due for accomplishing a great 
deal of work efficiently and to an un­
believably fine end. But the Secretarial 
Department, and all Margaret Morri­
son, wishes to thank (lie other diyi/ 
sions for their spendid help, in work 
and money, without which the great 
honor of a two-star flag could not have 
come to Tech.
O! YES!
At the regular meeting of the Sci­
ence Senate, on Tuesday evening, May 
12, the club room committee reported 
that it expects to open the old club 
room in the near future. New furni. 
ture is being obtained to equip the 
room.
Other matters discussed at the meet­
ing were Plebe regulations, and the 
printing of new sets of by-laws for the 
school.

GRAND SPECTACULAR AND AMAZING RECEPTION 
this week.
(We borrowed those adjectives from our circus press agent brothers) 
If you aren't interested, pleaae don’t read any further. That’s
perfectly all right—go right ahead, finish it on page 2.
Another of the. Tech activities that 
was suppressed during the war, ow­
ing to the drain of enlistments, was 
The Puppet, a Tech humorous publi­
cation that was issued six times a 
year. This publication was started in 
1915 and ran for a year and a half,
furnishing laughs to students and
Pittsburghers alike, when, with the 
outbreak of the war, practically the 
entire editorial staff entered the serv­
ice.
From cover to cover, this little
laugh-bringer Is a Tech product, as all 
the'humor, drawings, posters, editor­
ials and every thing that goes to 
make up the magazine, are produced 
by students, The text matter and
drawings are not concerning the 
school, but may bo enjoyed by all who 
like reading matter of this sort. Tt 
Œh after the order of Life and Judge, 
and has the added feature of a youth­
ful viewpoint.
The first Issue of this little mirth 
messenger* will make Its appearance 
during the coming week on the Pitts­
burgh news stands, and will be fol­
lowed the latter part of June by an­
other Issue. P radically the entire 
staff of the magazine are actively In­
terested In some of the other Tech 
activities, and so every phase of col* 
i lege life is touched.

to cheer our men over tho line. Folght 
of Denison breasted tho tape In the 
100-yard and 220-yard dashes In ex­

FORMER TECH STUDENT PERFECTS SUBMARINE
Henry P. Fuller, class of 1920, School 
of Applied Design, a draftsman at the 
Navy Yard, has completed the model 
for an Improved "K” type of submar­
ine which Is Intended to embrace and 
perfect a new Idea for which English 
and American naval engineers have 
been striving for some tlmo.
A feature of the •'K" type Is the 
method used for submersion, In the 
old type, water tanks are charged for 
submersion and emptied by mechan­
ical means. Navy construction en­
gineers of Europe and America have 
given much study and experiment to 
a more simple and effectlvo means of! 
operation.
The model may be exhibited In Nor­
folk in the near future.

Certainly every one is pleased to sec some settlement of the P. 
T. question. The discussion over this part of the prescribed’course 
of study has lasted long enough. It is not so much the proposition 
of drill itself but the commotion, agitation and mental distraction 
that follows such unrest. No one can properly concentrate upon his 
tasks at hand when there is something of vital importance demand­
ing his attention. To properly study, a person must have as little 
to think about as possible except his daily lessons, and surely the 
recent disturbance did not help bring about this mental calm.
After interviewing many of the heads of the departments of 
Science School, it was found that many of them believed that it was 
a spirit of Bolshevism on the part, of the students that was fanning 
the flame of discontent. They believe that the students’ action is an 
insult to their scheduling physical education and reflects a certain 
amount ol! presumptions egotism on the part of. the students. The 
Tartan feels and believes that the faculty is wrong in this conclu­
sion and also hopes that I lie relationship between students and faculty 
is, on the part ol' the faculty and students alike, as wholesome as 
cvor.
Well might we say, that it was not a spirit ol' Bolshevism or 
surely the entire student body would have never been so unanimous 
in their denunciation ol! the present method ol! administration. There 
is no explanation for the mental processes ol! six hundred students 
moving in I he same direction, except that; there was something wrong 
in 11n; system. Surely no man would hesitate to sacrifice a degree 
from any school for what he believes is right.
Hnl now that I he difficulty has been at least partially settled, let 
UN put our shoulders “to the wheel” and make a go of it now, as it 
has been rearranged! There is good in it for all who want to get it 
out;! (lo after I'. T. with a will.

INTERSCHOLASTIC TRACK MEET
Write to your high school friends. Tell them about Tech; bring 
them here and show them Tech; while they are here talk Tech, boost 
it at every opportunity and they will leave with a pleasant memory 
of Tech. If you do this you are doing yourself good and at the same 
time rendering your school a service. Be a booster. * Knocking is out 
of style.
PuppeT
If you want to laugh until your sides are sore—Buy Puppet. 
This little mirth provoker is about the cutest, cleverest, and at the 
same time the most “cutty’\of anything yet seen around Tech. Of 
course you READ IT—But BUY IT.
ATTENTION
Certain members of the Glee and Mandolin Clubs “ditched” 
the concert at the P. C. W. to attend various dances around school. 
What these men think about Tech’s reputation is a mystery. If they 
do not feel enough interest in the clubs to attend their concerts they 
certainly should not be so small as to keep others from the clubs! 
Waken up! Tech first, always.
SUPPORT THE ARTS
It is to be regretted that some one is up to his old tricks again. 
A poster, Minnie Hum, has been removed from the Central Building. 
This poster was put up there to advertise the, Design Scholarship 
Dance and consequently an injustice is being done to the Design 
Scholarship Fund in removing it before any one has had time to read 
it. This is not fair to Tech.
Furthermore, the student who designed this poster is being 
wrongfully deprived of some much needed credits. The poster has 
not been judged yet by the Professor of Art.

ymall table were yellow balloons. 
Fruit cocktail, chicken patties, sweet 
potato croquettes, tiny rolls, ice cream, 
fancy calces, coffee, nuts and mints 
composed the menu.
Much credit for the success of the 
hall is due to Peg Hollar, social chair­
man of the class. She, with her com­
mittee chairmen, Helen Savard, pro­
grams and favors; Sarah Gorzo, dec­
orations. and Elinor Mellon, invita­
tions, had entire charge of prepara­

Westminsterites in the first half of the 
second,, in the midst of a drizzling rain.
At the end of the half the rain was 
falling so steadily that all hands de­
cided to call it a day, and the game 
was called off, with the score stand­
ing Tech 3, Westminster 1.
One of the features of the short ses­
sion was the cadly impaired eyesight 
of Tom McNamara, who umpired the 
game. During the entire session the 
bleachers booed at the veteran umpire, 
who lias apparently “hit the skids.”

Juniors at M. M. have been guests 
at two dances within as many weeks: 
the first of these given on Friday, May 
9, by the Sophomores for both Fresh­
men and Juniors, was much enjoyed 
by all present. A charming blue and 
white “21” banner decorated the room 
in the Union. The Freshmen-Junior

“sweetest little program you ever

on a program that makes it- swreet;

Who is the debutante, our sisters

debutante some place where the Mag­
gie Murpheys won't see you. and no 
one will be the wiser.
Get this straight, now—we would 
not want to mislead you even for an 
exemption from P. T. While this 
debutante is a debutante in that “she’s | 
coming out.” it isn't the first time she 
has.had a chance to show her “wears.” 
You know—one the kind that comes 
out every other year or so. and take

der the “Donne Dust.”
Well, to tell you the truth, this 
debutante isn’t quite that naughty.

A REAL WELCOME FOR FIFTEENTH ENGINEERS
This afternoon Tech will endeavor 
to show the Tech men returning 
with the Fifteenth Engineers that 
the school is almost the same now 
as when they left it. Of course 
overybody will be there for classes 
will be dismissed at 1:30. You know 
what a good time you had on clean­
up day. The four schoolsa council 
is also in charge of this demonstra­
tion so it cannot help but be a suc­
cess.
Thirty of our ' graduates and for­
mer "students who were wi'th the En­
gineers, have already promised to be 
there. Many more will most prob 
ably come. So you see this will be 
just one big Tech reunion.
Everything will be done so that 
you as well as our guests will have 
a most enjoyable afternoon. Now 
for the order of procedure:
At two o’clock 'the crowd will as­
semble on the athletic field to wit­
ness the Sophomore-Fresh man class 
supremacy contests. There wijl be 
the following evonts.
1 Wrentllng — Lightweight and 
heavyweight.
2 Boxing In barrels—Lightweight 
and heavyweight.
3. Tug o’ War—Twenty-five men 
on each side.
¦1. Relay race with a man on 
back.
5 Four lap relay race.
There 1» no reason why the fresh­
man class cannot put on a splendid 
show. They certainly cannot give 
the old alibi that they are not or­
ganized.
The Sophomore class Is represented 
by the following commlttoo: A. l<
Leote (Science), Willard Perkins 
(Design), II. C. Hammon (Ind.), Th 
committee of the Freshman class 
consists of Clifford Lake (Design), 
Harold Skyrm (Science), and Kann 
(Industries.)
After the supremacy contest a 
baseball gamo botwoen Tech and Ohio

NEW PETITION AND
POSSIBLE SCHEDULE
(Continued From Page One.) 
given In the periods now vacant, and 
more dassefc might be scheduled on 
Saturday mornings. Men who are 
now working on Saturday mornings 
would be able to borrow enough money 
from the Student Loan Fund to make 
up the amount which they would .earn 
on five Saturdays, and the earnings 
from the additional two weeks in the 
summer will more than enable them 
to repay it.
Second, the schedule might be 
dianged by .-ubstltuting three one- 
hour periods of physical training a 
week for the proHenl five fifty-minute 
periods. We believe that this change 
in the system of physical education 
would eliminate all the dissatisfaction 
which the student body has felt over 
this question. The details of the new 
system can be worked out in a man­
ner somewhat like the following:
Classes would extend from 8:30 to 
4:30, the ordinary hour for physical 
training from 4:30 to 5:30, three days 
a week. For the other two days reci­
tations or laboratory might be contin­
ued to 5:30. If all Science men should 
take physical' training together there 
would be a group of three hundred as 
a maximum, the remainder of the men 
being excused either for R. O. T. C. or 
athletic teams. If the schedule 
should be so arranged that a consid­
erable group of men—say 75 or more— 
could take the exercise at an earlier 
hour in the afternoon, the department 
would be able to give it to them at 
any hour up to three o'clock, although 
not from three to four-thirty; and 
then the remainder of the men would 
be scheduled at 4:30. This exercise 
would not be, given on the athletic 
field, but would consist of mass jog­
ging and other exercises through the 
park. Everyone would be required to 
wear a gymnasium suit, arid the fifteen 
minutes from 4:30 to 4:45 would be 
allowed for changing clothes. Actual 
exercise would extend from 4:45, to 
5:15, with the remainder of the time 
for taking showers and again chang­
ing clothes. Since . army clothes 
would be worn and since the twenty 
new showers being installed will pro­
vide room for everyone, the class 
would be held in rainytweather as well 
as fair weather. We understand that 
physical education is t.o continue to 
June 20, but the department of physi­
cal education recommends that the 
Seniors bp exempted on June 1.
The above named* committee of the 
' Senate will be glad to confer with the 
Dean of the Department of Science 
and Engineering at any time concern­
ing the two proposed changes. ' 
Respectfully,
P. H. ARMOR, Chairman

around anyway. About that time the 
team needs most' cheering, if it is a 
dlose game, or if it is losing. Come 
around, make the old stands creak 
with your weight, and cheer the team
The other activities need your pat­
ronage. Far too many, missed the 
Home Concert, which, by the way, 
was advertised more than a month 
ahead. In a general- assembly almost 
every seat is filled, so that if every 
fellow had come and taken a girl there 
would have been a big demand for 
standing room. But, instead, there 
were many vacant: seats. That was 
because so many who could and should 
have come stayed away and, as a re­
sult, missed the finest evening's, en­
tertainment arijl showed a great lack 
of spirit Into the bargain.
As to the dances, the Union should 
be crowded every time there is a 
general dance, such as the tennis 
dances. If you can’t dance, learn 
now, and if you can show us by com­
ing along. You’ll miss lots of fun if 
you don’t.
Here are some of the events in the 
near future. Show your spirit by 
showing yourself: Baseball at home,
May 21, May 29, June 5; tennis, May 
23 and June 2, and don’t forget the 
tennis dance on the 23rd; track meet 
every Saturday; Design Scholarship 
Ball, May 27. These are not all, but 
all events are announced in time to 
know.
If you’re any good as an athlete, 
come out. for a team, if you are not, 
come out and cheer. Let’s get back 
the old Tech spirit before it dies out. 
If you can’t yell, bring somebody that 
can; if you can yell, bring some one 
anyway, and, by the way, if you like 
her so well she will show up at her 
best in a Tech event.
C’mon, show some spirit!

in Civil Engineering in Tech.
Donald G'awthrop, who lives at 1304 
¦Center street, Wllklnsburg, is a Jun­
ior in Chemical and is a crackevjack 
in tlhe singles.
Clin vies J. Copley, 597 Elm street, 
Springfield, Mo., is a versatile cln\p 
who plays equally well in both sets. 
He is a Sophomore in Civil Engi­
neering.
Edwin Stevens Stockslager, who is 
a Junior in Chemical Engineering, 
lives at 7022 Thomas boulevard. Pitts­
burgh, and is the fourth man of the 
quartet that took Pitt’s measure last 
Wednesday.
John C. Harkness.- a Sophomore in 
Civil Engineering,-lives at 7116 Brigh
ton road, Ben Avon, and is another 
member of the Tech squad.
The management, of the team is- 
under Francis J. Nuttall, one of the 
best known young men in Tech. Nut- 
tall is connected with practically 
every one of the sports in Tech and 
'has shown rare ability in the sched­
ule of tennis games that he has ar­
ranged. He Is a member of the 
Senior class in Civil Engineering and 
lives at 2958 Hutton avenue, Pitts­
burgh.
Helping Nuttall as Assistant Man­
ager is E. F. Hirsch, a Junior in 
Civil Engineering, who is also a 
Pittsburgh boy and lives at 6317 
Stanton avenue. Hirsch makes it his 
business to supervise equipment and 
takes care of keeping authentic 
scores. Joe Gorman is also on the 
managing end, keeping up the courts.
So far in Uhe year Tech has met 
her rival Pitt and emerged victorious 
by the score of 5 to 1. However a 
return match with the other Pitts­
burgh Institution will occur later in 
the season at Tech courts. Steam 
shovels are terracing down the ra­
vine next to the Margaret Morrison 
Division and engineers are working 
on the laying out of twelve courts 
at Uhe bottom of this ravine that will 
give Tech the most modern and beau­
tiful courts' in this part of the coun­
try. Girls’ teams at the Margaret 
Morrison Division have already been 
organized and the game known of 
old by flannels and blazer jackets has 
once more returned to the Tech ath­
letic menu.

TECH BASEBALL
The canniness of Wagner has 
demonstrated itself in all the games 
played by the* Techites. "Honus” fol­
lows no precedent. The mere fact 
that a pitcher is a pitcher, does not 
prevent Wagner from sending a pitch­
er into the outfield. In the first game 
of the year, when Tech met the Dukes, 
Honus sent Captain Gretzler, the old­
est and most experienced pitcher on 
the team, into the outfield. On the 
mound, in Gretzler’s place, a little fel­
low, named McGraw, was placed. Re­
sult, Gretzler’s long legs cut off sev­
eral Duke runs, while the untried 
pitcher had a style’ of delivery that 
“Honus” believed would fool the 
Dulces. It did, for 14 Dukes cut the 
air, while but five got hits, and but two 
passes were issued -by McGraw. Score,
5 to 3. A baseball game won by 
brains. In the game with the Leb­
anon Valley College team, the Leban­
on Valley team began hitting Captain 
Gretzler, but Honus saw the Kilties 
were walloping the Lebanon Valley 
moundsman all over the field. He let 
the game run for an inning or two, 
and then sent Elmer Weiss in to re­
lieve the captain. Weiss immediately 
stopped the hitting bee, but the Tecli- 
ites continued to pile up runs until it 
looked like the score of a basket ball 
game. Score—Tech, 13; Lebanon Val­
ley, S.
A good part of the time Honus lias 
been trying out pitchers, realizing that 
the essential thing in baseball is to 
prevent the other fellow from hitting 
the ball. As a result he has uncovered 
some finds. Beside Captain Gretzler 
arid McCaw on the slab, are Elmer 
Weiss, Lusby of Washington, D. C.; 
Elliott and Helfreitch. Weiss is get­
ting admirable control which, coupled 
with a ball like a rifle bullet, makes | 
him a bad man to face.
Little Lusby, the Washington boy, is 
also proving a real And as a mounds­
man, for he is the trickiest of the 
Tech team. He is a terror on runners 
who wander too far off first base, as 
he throws without changing position, 
and is very speedy. No steals are 
made from first when Lusby is in the 
box and “Midget” Doherty on first.
The Tech line-up has taken shape, 
and the team are getting together on 
the team work. The dangerous op­
ponents of Tech are still to be played, 
and the real test of Wagner’s coaching 
.will probably come when Tech meets 
Penn State on June 7 arid June 10. In 
winning either of these two games, 
the “old veteran” will have shown that 
the loss to the game of baseball of the 
premier shortstop of the game is more 
than replaced by the gain of a real 
coach.
The schedule of the Tecliites for the 
balance of the year is:
May 21, Ohio Wesleyan at Tech 
Field.
May 24, Indiana Normal at Indiana, 
Pa.
May 29, Muskingum College at Tech
