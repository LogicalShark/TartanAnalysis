Activists demand justice in Gammage case
U.S. News ranks grad 
schools and programs

In the latest round of graduate school 
rankings published by U.S. News and 
World Report, Carnegie Mellon’s slew of 
strong graduate programs have once 
again placed the University near the top 
of many categories. Moving from eighth 
to fourth in engineering, holding on to 
sixth in the Masters of Fine Arts and 
Drama degrees, and tying for first place 
in the doctoral Computer Science pro­
gram with MIT, CMU held steady or 
improved in nearly every category that 
the magazine ranked.
Although the Graduate School of In­
dustrial Administration (GSIA) dropped 
one spot, from 14th to 15th, University 
Provost Paul Christiano said that he is 
confident that the college will be able to 
meet its goal of a top-ten spot within five 
years. “The fact that [the ranking] goes 
down a couple of notches is meaning­
less,” he said. “T do think that GSIA still 
has the top PhD program in the country, 
though.” Christiano said that GSIA, as a 
relatively small program, suffers in the 
rankings because it cannot support the 
breadth that other programs do.
However, CMUs improved engineer­
ing rank gives the administration a rea­
son to smile at the rankings. “[The im­
proved rank] is really amazing, consid­
ering the size of the college,” said 
Christiano. “But it just speaks to the 
very, very high quality of the faculty.”
CMUs H. J. Heinz School of Public 
Policy and Management also fared well 
in the survey, coming in eighth overall. 
Its public policy analysis program ended 
up at fourth place, while its information
and technology program was rated as 
the best in the nation. This was the first 
year that U.S. News had a ranking 
system for public affairs programs. 
Three years ago, the magazine ranked 
public administration programs, where 
the Heinz school came in tenth. How­
ever, says Heinz School dean Mark 
Kamlet, the college specializes more in 
public policy than in public adminis­
tration and therefore suffered under 
the previous system.
U.S. News bases its rankings on a 
variety of factors, from academic repu­
tation to student selectivity. For ex­
ample, 25 percent of the engineering 
and business rankings were based on 
schools’ reputations within the aca­
demic world, with an additional 15 
percent of the total score coming from 
the schools’ reputations within the 
professional world. Other factors, such 
as student-to-faculty ratio and post­
graduation placement rates are also 
incorporated into the final score.
Although the U.S. News tabulations 
are a high-profile ranking system, 
many educators question their valid­
ity as a means of ascertaining the level 
of a given school’s quality. For ex­
ample, deans from 164 law schools 
have endorsed a letter criticizing the 
rankings. The letter warns applicants 
pf “serious problems” with the 
rankings, criticizing the fact that the 
rankings ignore faculty quality and 
curricula and that the magazine does 
not properly account for graduates who 
fail to report their status.
“These rankings can be fickle,” said 
Kamlet. “I think these rankings al­
ways have to be interpreted with a 
grain of salt — maybe a whole bushel 
of salt.”

Participants in the Journey for Justice march attempt to pressure the Justice department into prosecuting accused officers.
By DANIEL ARP
Tartan Contributing Editor ,
In the two and a half years since the 
death of Jonny Gammage, the protests 
by local and national civil rights groups 
have not died down. Now, one year after 
a march in Washington, D.C. that failed 
to bring any action from the federal gov­
ernment, protesters gathered again in 
front of the Justice Department last Fri­
day to call for a federal investigation into 
the Jonny Gammage case.
In an attempt to spur the Justice De­
partment to action, about sixty people 
representing the Pittsburgh chapter of 
the NAACP, the Pittsburgh Urban 
League, and the Campus Coalition for 
Peace and Justice (CCPJ) traveled to 
Washington, D.C. last Friday. The pro­
testers joined Gammage’s family on 
buses from Pittsburgh and Syracuse, 
NY, where Gammage’s parents reside. 
Many came carrying signs with the 
coroner’s photograph of Gammage’s face, 
bruised and beaten by Brentwood police 
in October 1995.
“Five cops, one man — and this is' the 
end result,” said protester Reneé Johnson.
“That’s right,” shouted another pro­
tester. “Enthusiasm. Get that feeling. 
This is war here.”
“We’re not asking for anything spe­
cial. We just want justice,” said Debra 
James- Bailey, a database assistant in 
Enrollment Services at CMU who took 
personal time off to be at the rally. She 
said she had been planning for this day 
since March. “Not all police are bad. I 
just think those [officers] got out of con- 
' trol. But if you get out of control, you go 
to jail,” she said.
• In October, 1995, Gammage was pulled 
over in a traffic stop by Sergeant Milt 
Mulholland and four other police offic­
ers in Brentwood, a suburb of Pitts­
burgh. Within seven minutes, Gammage 
had been suffocated to death in an ap­
parent scuffle.
Protesters argue that Gammage’s death 
was racially motivated and that the case 
should therefore be tried in the federal 
courts as a Civil Rights violation.
“We feel that the cops violated his 
Civil Rights because he was African 
American, and we believe there’s plenty 
of evidence to show that,” said Pete 
Shell, a computer science student at 
CMU and a member of the CCPJ, which 
was started by CMU and Pitt students, 
faculty, and staff in response to 
Gammage’s death. “If Jonny Gammage 
was a white businessman, we believe 
he’d be alive today,” said Shell.
Adding urgency to the push for federal 
intervention is the fact that, after two- 
and-a-half years, the case has yet to be 
resolved locally. One of the officers, John 
Votjas, was acquitted of involuntary 
manslaughter in November 1996. Two 
others were never tried. The two trials of 
Mulholland and officer Michael Albert

CMU hires new head librarian
By BENJAMIN ROBERTS
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
After a year and a half of search­
ing, Carnegie Mellon will finally 
be getting a new University Li­
brarian. Dr. Gloriana St. Clair, 
who has served as Interim Dean 
of University Libraries at Penn­
sylvania State University for the 
past year and a half, will take 
over for Acting Udiversity Librar­
ian Erika Linke.
Provost Paul Christiano an­
nounced the decision last Mon­
day, putting an end to a search 
that began when former Univer­
sity Librarian Charles Lowry re­
signed in 1996.
“We were fortunate to attract 
many highly capable candidates,” 
said Christiano on the strength 
of the applicant pool. “St. Clair 
was selected because of her 
wealth of experience, her knowl­
edge of contemporary problems 
facing university libraries and her 
interest in fundraising on behalf 
of libraries. I have every expecta­
tion that she will charter an ex­
citing and productive course for 
our libraries at Carnegie Mellon.”
Christiano had laid out four key 
areas that the new librarian would 
need to concentrate in. Those ar­
eas were to establish an electronic 
library, to evaluate the collection 
as as a whole to make sure it is as 
good as possible, to monitor space 
issues in Hunt Library, and to 
make sure the library is as effec­
tive and effecient as possible.
St. Clair will begin her tenure 
on April 1, facing the final phase­
out of CMU’s Library Informa­
tion System (LIS), the first uni­
versity library system in the na­
tion to provide access to a library 
catalog and other databases us­
ing distributed computing. Other 
current projects within the CMU 
library system include the re- 
cently-activated Heinz Elec­
tronic Library Interactive On­
line System (HELIOS), an online 
database which uses natural lan­
guage processing software to 
provide access to more than one 
million documents.
The electronic library will be
one of St. Clair’s key concentra­
tions. The goal of the project that 
the University is pushing for is to 
have many of the texts in the 
library available online. “The 
point of the electronic library is 
making it so students can use it 
fully at anytime and anywhere,” 
St. Clair said.
The goals of St. Clair’s new posi­
tion are not the only thing that 
appeals to her. “[CMU] is a pre­
mier research institution commit­
ted to excellence in teaching,” she 
said. “The more I got the know the 
students and its faculty, the more 
interested I became.”
Dr. St. Clair earned her 
bachelor’s degree in English in 
1962 from the University of Okla­
homa, her masters degree in li­
brary sciences in 1963 at the 
University of California at Ber­
keley, a doctor’s degree in litera­
ture at the University of Okla­
homa in 1970, and a master’s 
degree in business management 
at the University of Texas at San 
Antonio in 1980.

Warfare expert charged 
with anthrax possession
Secretary of State advises Americans to evacuate Kuwait, Israel
LAS VEGAS (AP) - One is a self- 
styled expert on germ warfare with a 
felony record and a high profile with 
America’s right-wing counterculture.
The other is apparently a stranger 
to publicity, living in a remote desert 
town near Lake Mead with his wife 
and three children and running a fire- 
safety business.
Larry Wayne Harris and William 
Job Leavitt Jr. were charged Thursday 
with possessing anthrax, or its precur­
sor, and with conspiring to possess the 
deadly germ warfare agent. Their law­
yers say the material seized when the 
FBI arrested the men outside a medi­
cal office was a legal vaccine.
Harris, 46, is no stranger to this 
kind of controversy. He pleaded guilty 
in 1995 to wire fraud after his arrest in 
Lancaster, Ohio, for obtaining three 
vials of freeze-dried bubonic plague 
bacteria through the mail. He said at 
the time he merely wanted the bacte­
ria for research on his self-published 
book, Bacteriological Warfare: A Ma­
jor Threat to North America.
The book is cast as instructions on 
how to survive a biological attack. But 
the Klanwatch project of the Southern 
Poverty Law Center, which monitors 
domestic hate groups, contends it’s 
basically a how-to manual.
The FBI hasn’t said what the motive 
might be in the Nevada case, but notes 
that Harris belonged to the Aryan 
Nations, which was confirmed by lead­
ers of the white supremacist group.
Interviewed in 1997 for a never- 
aired TV documentary by investiga­
tive journalist James Neff, Harris told 
of obtaining anthrax spores by sink­
ing a long metal probe into a 20-year-
old burial site for cows infected with 
the disease.
Harris claimed he successfully cul­
tured the spores in his lab. Asked if he 
actually possessed anthrax, he simply 
smiled, said Neff, now an Ohio State 
University journalism professor who 
worked on the documentary with Or­
egon Public Broadcasting.
According to Neff, Harris described 
how someone could create a deadly 
broth from the anthrax culture. He 
said one could put it in a pressurized 
paint sprayer and then spread the 
deadly germs from a low-flying air­
plane — killing at least 100,000 people
— and still be undetectable.
According to a sketchy account in an 
FBI affidavit, Harris once told an un­
specified group about plans to plant a 
“globe” of bubonic plague toxins on 
New York City subway tracks in an 
attack calculated to kill hundreds of 
thousands and ruin the economy. It 
was unclear from the affidavit if the 
alleged comments concerned the 
plague bacteria in the Ohio case.
Harris has said he wants to raise 
Americans’ consciousness about the 
possibility of a biological attack. In 
one interview, he said conversations 
with a graduate student from Iraq 
sensitized him to the threat of bio­
terrorism from that country.
“I was actively involved in training 
Iraqi microbiologists on how to conduct 
biological warfare,” Harris said on The 
Intelligence Report, produced by mili­
tia-linked Wolverine Productions of Ann 
Arbor, Mich. “We provided the weapons 
for them. We trained them.” Harris said 
the plan was for Iraq, then a U.S. ally, to 
use the materials against Iran.
Beloved baseball 
announcer dies
RANCHO MIRAGE, Calif. (AP) - 
Harry Caray, who took millions of fans 
out to the ball game on radio and televi­
sion, died Wednesday, four days after 
collapsing at a Valentine’s Day dinner. 
He was believed to be 77.
In a career spanning almost 60 years, 
the often offbeat Hall of Fame broad­
caster covered baseball’s greats from 
Musial to Mays to Maddux. Holy Cow! 
as he would say.
“We’re going to miss old Harry,” Hall 
of Famer Stan Musial said. “He 
was always the life of the party, the life 
of baseball.”
Caray had a heart attack Saturday at 
a nightclub-restaurant while with his 
wife, Dutchie, near their winter home. 
He died of brain damage caused by the 
attack, said Harlan Corenman, 
Eisenhower Medical Center spokesman.
A broadcaster since 1941, Caray be­
came a household name through his Chi­
cago Cubs games for WGN-TV, carried 
nationally by many cable systems. He 
was immediately recognizable for his 
thick, oversized glasses and raspy, sing- 
along rendition of “Take Me Out to the 
Ball Game” over the public address sys­
tem during the seventh-inning stretch.
“Nobody could sing ‘Take Me Out to 
the Ball Game’ like he could,” said First 
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, a lifelong 
Cubs fan. “And I hope he’s doing a sev­
enth-inning rendition in heaven.” 
Caray had recently reduced his broad­
casting on WGN. He cut out road trips in 
1997, saying they were “a grind for 
ballplayers, and they can be pretty tough 
on announcers, too.”
And in December, it was announced 
that his grandson, Chip Caray, would 
join him and analyst/sidekick Steve 
Stone in broadcasting Cubs home games. 
At the time, the veteran broadcaster 
said he had no plans to leave the booth
anytime soon, but he admitted the sta­
tion probably had a successor in mind 
when it hired his grandson.
Caray was the patriarch of a three- 
generation broadcast family. In addi­
tion to grandson Chip, there is Caray’s 
son, Skip, who announces Atlanta 
Braves games.
Caray won the Ford C. Frick Award in 
1989, putting him in the broadcast wing 
of the baseball Hall of Fame, and he was 
elected to the National Sportscasters 
and Sportswriters Hall of Fame in 1988.Parrot saves life 
during house fire
BRYN MAWR, Penn. (AP) - Rupert 
knew enough to start squawking when 
the house fire started. The parrot is 
talking again — faintly — now that he’s 
been saved from the rubble.
“He said ‘Hi-ya Rup,’ ” said Lynn 
Norley, still shaken after the fire that 
destroyed her historic home in subur­
ban Philadelphia.
The fire would have destroyed Norley, 
too, if Rupert hadn’t noticed Monday’s 
fire. The gray African parrot woke Norley 
just in time for her to drop her two dogs out 
a second-floor bathroom window, then 
jump to safety herself.
Norley thought her pet of 12 years had 
died. She had left him wrapped in a 
towel in the bathroom.
Hours later, firefighters found 
Rupert in the tub under fallen layers of 
insulation and bathroom tiles. He was 
wet, black from soot, and weak from 
smoke inhalation.
Rupert’s voice isn’t what it was, but 
the bird is doing fine. Norley said Thurs­
day that she’s had calls from bird spe­
cialists all over the country who can’t 
believe Rupert survived.
“I thought he was dead,” said Norley, 
who spoiled her recovering bird with 
$80 worth of toys this week at her par­
ents’ home. “I can’t believe how well he 
seems. No one can [believe] he’s alive.”
El Niño swamps 
southeastern U.S.
SOUTHEAST, U.S. (AP) - Record 
rain, tree-toppling wind, and flooding 
hammered the Southeast and East Coast 
last week, swamping boats and knock­
ing out power from Florida to Virginia. 
At least four people were killed.
The Coast Guard sent aircraft and two 
ships today to resume the search for four 
fishermen feared drowned off the coast of 
North Carolina, said Lieutenant Tom 
Sullivan. The crewofthe 68-foot Josephine, 
fishing for summer flounder, was last 
heard from early Tuesday in an area where 
seas had been running up to 10 feet high.
A Marine helicopter found the vessel 
capsized Tuesday afternoon, some 20 
miles offshore and about 100 miles south 
of Cape Hatteras. Searchers found a life 
preserver and an empty six-person life 
raft twelve miles away.
Three people were killed in the At­
lanta area as pea-sized hail and heavy 
rain sent cars skidding on crowded high­
ways early Tuesday. A tree trimmer in 
Florida was electrocuted a day earlier as 
he worked in high wind.
The 9.4 inches of rain in Wilmington 
this month is already a February record. 
The storm system brought at least five 
tornadoes to Florida before dumping six 
inches of rain across the Southeast.
South Carolina’s coastal areas were so 
flooded that residents on the Edisto and 
Santee rivers paddled to their homes. In 
Myrtle Beach, walkways were covered 
by more than a foot of water.
The rain and wind knocked pine trees 
onto houses, cars, and a golf course on 
Georgia’s St. Simons Island, damaging 
the island’s covered bridge so badly that 
it had to be torn down.
Power was knocked out briefly to
77,000 people in Georgia and North 
Carolina. Some utility workers said the 
ground is so saturated that the wind was 
enough to topple trees.
WASHINGTON (AP) - As 
¦’resident Clinton issued another 
warning to Iraq, Secretary of 
•State Madeleine Albright told 
amilies of American officials in 
srael and Kuwait to consider 
whether “it would be prudent 
to depart.”
She offered the same advice to 
officials at U.S. diplomatic offices 
n the two countries if their jobs 
are not essential.
If they choose to go — they are 
not being ordered out — the U.S. 
government will pay the ex­
penses. The State Department 
estimated the number of family 
members and nonessential work­
ers in the two countries at 150.
“The probability of Iraq resort­
ing to the use of chemical or bio­
logical weapons is remote, but it 
cannot be excluded,” State De­
partment spokesman James P. 
Rubin said Friday.
U.N. Secretary-General Kofi 
Annan, meanwhile, was seeking 
a diplomatic solution in Baghdad 
with the good wishes of the Clinton
administration but also the ad­
monition that any formula must 
provide for unlimited access to 
arms sites by U.N. inspectors.
“If it is something less, we re­
serve the right to disagree,” Rubin 
said. For his part, Annan said on 
arrival in the Iraqi capital that 
he was “reasonably optimistic” 
he could help avert a conflict. 
Deputy Prime Minister Tariq 
Aziz, who greeted Annan at the 
airport wearing an olive-green 
uniform, said he shared 
Annan’s optimism.
Clinton, slightly rephrasing the 
administration’s months-old 
warning to Iraq that force may be 
used if weapons sites are not 
opened for U.N. inspection, said 
“either Saddam acts or we will 
have to.”
The president made his re­
marks in an address taped for 
broadcast in the Arab world in 
connection with a Security Coun­
cil vote to allow Iraq to more than 
double the amount of oil it can 
sell under a U.N. oil-for-food plan.
“No people have suffered more at 
the hands of Saddam Hussein 
than the Iraqi people themselves,” 
Clinton said.
Retired General Norman 
Schwarzkopf, in an interview 
broadcast on CNBC Friday night, 
said that with the U.N. secre­
tary general pushing for a solu­
tion in Iraq, “chances are good 
that we won’t have to take mili­
tary action.”
Schwarzkopf, who led Ameri­
can troops in the Gulf War, said 
that Clinton and Saddam had 
“both painted themselves into a 
corner” and there is now a chance 
for them to get out of it. But he 
said stopping the attack is still 
up to Saddam.
At the Pentagon, officials were 
considering whether to speed up 
plans to vaccinate U.S. troops 
against the deadly germ warfare 
agent anthrax. It is one of the 
biological ingredients the United 
Nations, the United States, and 
Britain believe Iraq holds in se­
cret storage.
Rubin said the United States 
had not received “intelligence of 
an imminent threat” against Is­
rael or Kuwait. But he said Ameri­
cans in the two countries had 
“some anxiety,” and “We have 
decided to allow family members 
and nonemergency employees of 
our official American community 
to exercise the option of voluntar­
ily departing on these three mis­
sions, should they feel it better 
for themselves or their families.”
He referred to the U.S. embas­
sies in Tel Aviv and Kuwait and 
the U.S. consulate in Jerusalem.
Israel and Kuwait are longtime 
targets of President Saddam 
Hussein’s wrath. He invaded 
Kuwait in 1990 and annexed the 
oil-rich Arab emirate. The United 
States organized a multinational 
army to drive Iraq out.
Israel, which destroyed an Iraqi 
nuclear reactor in 1981, is unac­
ceptable to the militant Arab 
leader because it is a Jewish state. 
Iraq’s supporters in the Arab 
world accuse the Clinton admin­
istration of maintaining a “double 
standard” — threatening Iraq but 
not forcing Israel to give up land 
to the Arabs.
At the White House, spokes­
man Mike McCurry said the 
United States wanted to be in a 
position to protect American citi­
zens “in any contingencies.” He 
also expressed concern that Iraq 
was encouraging more news or­
ganizations to come there. “We 
want to deter people from going 
there,” he said.
“We don’t want people to un­
necessarily be in harm’s way,” 
McCurry said. “And we would 
encourage news organizations 
and all U.S. citizens to follow 
very carefully the advice that 
we’re giving on travel in and 
around that region.”
The spokesman said the U.S. 
government would “raise with 
news organizations the concerns 
we have.”
Even so, some Americans in 
the Middle East said Friday they 
had no plans to go home.
“I am not going anywhere,” 
said Sandy Stein, a 32-year- 
old teacher who is married to 
a Kuwaiti.
“My family is here, my life is 
here,” she said. “If an evacuation 
is ordered, I don’t know what I 
would do.”
On Capitol Hill, Senator Arlen 
Specter (R-Penn.) said he was 
preparing a resolution to indict 
Saddam as an international war 
criminal. Trial in the Interna­
tional Court in The Hague, Neth­
erlands, would depend on the tri­
bunal extending its jurisdiction 
to Iraq.
Nation of Islam leader Louis 
Farrakhan said in Chicago that 
he has written a letter to Saddam 
pleading with him to cooperate 
with the United Nations and its 
weapons inspectors. Farrakhan, 
who returned Friday from a 
three-month world tour, said 
that he also wrote to Clinton 
asking him to refrain from 
taking any military action 
against Iraq.

50 YEARS AGO, March 2,1948
— A committee formed by Stu­
dent Council to examine the con­
dition and quality of student din­
ing services reported that the 
Skibo Cafeteria fell short in ar­
eas of price, cleanliness, service, 
and food quality. The committee 
found that the cost of food in 
Skibo was higher than prices 
maintained in local restaurants, 
that many students complained 
about dirty dishes and sub-stan­
dard service, and that many stu­
dents felt the quality of food to be 
unsatisfactory. The report issued 
by the committee called for the 
establishment of a student-fac- 
ulty advisory group to monitor 
the cafeteria.
25 YEARS AGO, February 20, 
1973 — President Richard M. 
Cyert announced plans for a $2.25 
million renovation and expansion
of the College of Fine Arts. Presi­
dent Cyert proposed that the Mar­
garet Morrison College building 
be given to the CFA — displacing 
the H&SS Dean’s office, the 
School of Urban and Public Af­
fairs, and the Biology Laborato­
ries — and that the CFA building 
itself be refurbished and im­
proved. To ease the concerns of 
the Drama Department, Cyert 
promised to construct a theater 
before his tenure expired.
10 YEARS AGO,February 23, 
1988 — President Richard M. 
Cyert announced that Pohang 
Iron and Steel Company (POSCO) 
had donated one million dollars 
to the department of Metallurgi­
cal and Material Science (MEMS) 
to endow a professorship. No pro­
fessor was immediately named to 
the endowed position, which was 
expected to carry an indefinite
tenure. Along with Alcoa- and 
US Steel-sponsored positions, the 
POSCO chair was MEMS’s third 
corporate endowment.
FIVE YEARS AGO, February 
22, 1993 — University Provost 
Paul Christiano announced that 
the Commission on the Status 
and Needs of Women was prepar­
ing its report for President 
Mehrabian. The Commission’s 
initial findings concluded that 
women were under-represented 
in faculty positions and received 
disparate salaries from their male 
counterparts in comparison to 
competing universities. Among 
the student population, the Com­
mission noted that discrimina­
tion and inequalities plagued fe­
male students — likewise under­
represented — in both classroom 
and social settings. The Commis­
sion was created to follow up the
results of a similar study com­
pleted in 1972.
ONE YEAR AGO,. February 
24,1997 — The second and third 
floors of Roberts Hall were fin­
ished, and faculty began moving 
into offices. Construction began 
in early spring 1995 and was ham­
pered by muddy conditions on out- 
of-the-way Neville Street. The 
building houses the Data Storage 
Systems Center and researchers 
at the Electrical and Computer 
Engineering Department. In ad­
dition, Roberts Hall contains high- 
powered microscopes and an en­
gineering library. The building 
was named after George Roberts, 
a graduate of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology and the construc­
tion project’s major contributor.

CMU hires librarian
LIBRARIAN, from page 1
At Penn State, St. Clair di­
rected operations at the Patemo/ 
Pattee Library, six main cam­
pus subject libraries, and 20 
branch campus libraries around 
the state. Her responsibilities 
included budgets, strategic plan­
ning, personnel resources, li­
brary automation, and the de­
velopment of collections, ser­
vices, and programs. She also 
served as interim associate dean 
for planning and administra­

Crime and Incident Report
2/14 ASSIST OUTSIDE 
AGENCY, 2:23 am — An officer 
on patrol was flagged down by a 
pedestrian in the middle of Forbes 
Avenue near Beeler Street. The 
pedestrian stated that he had 
smoked a lot of crack, took eight 
800 mg Motrins, had been drink­
ing, and wanted to kill himself.
The officer asked the man to 
step to the curb while he radioed 
for CMU backup. Then he radi­
oed City Dispatch, requesting 
backup and a medical unit. The 
officer asked the man if he had 
any more drugs or any weapons 
on his person. He replied that he 
did not. The man was searched 
by the responding city medical 
unit and transported to Presby­
terian Hospital.
2/14 VEHICLE STOP,3:05 am 
— An officer in a marked police 
vehicle was parked in the 
Morewood Gardens turnabout 
when he saw a car leaving Park­
ing Area #17 at a speed which he 
believed was too high. The bot­
tom of the vehicle scraped the 
roadway when the car turned onto 
Morewood and the driver made 
no attempt to yield despite the 
posted yield sign.
The officer activated his lights 
and made the driver pull over in 
front of the University Center. 
The driver was identified as a 
CMU student. During the stop, 
the officer smelled alcohol on the 
man’s breath. The officer asked 
the man to exit the vehicle so that 
he could administer a walk-and- 
turn sobriety test. The actor was 
unable to walk, so the police of­
ficer had the man’s car parked in 
the Tech Garage and drove the 
man home.
2/14 FALSE ID/DRUG PARA­
PHERNALIA/UNDERAGE 
DRINKING, 5:13 am — A stu­
dent who had been drinking had 
locked himself in his room, which 
worried his friends. After pound­
ing on the door sporadically for 
half an hour in an attempt to 
wake the student, the friends 
called Campus Police.
Two officers responded to the 
scene. Upon their arrival, the of­
ficers found the student uncon­
scious on a couch. As one officer 
tried to wake him, the other of­
ficer observed an open wallet in
Corrections and Clarifications...
In issue 17, the article on page L2 titled, “Sweepstakes chair 
prepares for season” there are several corrections. The third 
question asks “Have you ever seen an accident while watching 
buggy?” Dani Barnard did not witness the accident of the 
disoriented buggy driver, although she has heard about it.
Barnard’s quote, “I think she thought the bridge wasn’t turn­
ing as soon as it did,” is inaccurate. Barnard explained that the 
driver got disoriented and didn’t know where the bridge was, so 
she turned late and crashed into the hay bales lining the road.
Barnard’s quote, “And a driver from one organization had to be 
asked not to drive anymore because she was too tall, and there 
was no room,” is also inaccurate. Barnard explained that if a 
driver is too tall their arms may also be too long to fit into a 
particular buggy.
The quote, “If the person is too tall, sometimes there isn’t 
enough room for steering and brakes,” is also inaccurate. Barnard 
explained that all buggies have steering and brakes which would 
never be sacrificed to fit a tall driver. If the arms of a driver are 
especially long, the driver may have difficulty seeing their 
surroundings and navigating the course while in the buggy.

plain sight that the officer con­
cluded contained a fake ID. The 
officer who found the fake ID went 
to his car to retrieve a citation 
form. While he was gone, the re­
maining officer observed a bong, 
commonly used for drug use, in 
plain sight. The actor, who was 
beginning to wake up, denied 
ownership, saying that it was his 
roommate’s.
The student was issued a non­
traffic citation for the fake ID 
and a CMU citation for having 
drug paraphernalia in his room. 
The fake ID and the bong were 
placed in the temporary evidence 
locker, where the bong awaits 
testing for THC.
2/15 MEDICAL,4:53 pm - An 
officer was dispatched to High­
lander Cafe for a medical call. 
Upon his arrival, student EMS 
personnel were evaluating the 
victim, a dining services em­
ployee. The man stated that he 
was changing the grease in the 
fryer, which had been shut off at 
1:30 pm. He said that he drained 
the old grease into a large metal 
pot. He then carried the pot to the 
Highlander loading dock to empty 
it into a 55-gallon storage drum. 
But as he was lifting the pot to 
empty it, he slipped causing some 
of the grease to splash onto his 
face. The grease remained hot 
even though it had not been 
heated for several hours. After 
the EMS finished their evalua­
tion and irrigated his eyes, he 
stated that he felt fine. The EMS 
recommended that he go to the 
hospital to be on the safe side, but 
he declined transportation.

JUSTICE, from page 1
have resulted in mistrials, and a 
third trial for both of them is 
scheduled to take place in either 
April or May.
But many see the third trial as 
beside the point. “We just feel there 
isn’t a possibility of a fair trial 
with the District Attorney ofPitts- 
burgh,” said Bruce Keller, a mem­
ber of the NAACP. “We’re very 
anxious to have the Justice De­
partment investigate.”
“A third trial in Pittsburgh 
would be a total waste of taxpay­
ers’ money,” said Bailey, who said 
she would rather see all five offic­
ers tried in federal court. She said 
that it would not be justice to 
“throw [Mulholland and Albert] 
to the wolves.”
A trial of all five officers would 
be impossible locally since the 
acquittal of Votjas. Many con­
sider Votjas to be the officer most 
responsible for what happened, 
since he was the only one inter­
acting with Gammage at the time 
the scuffle began. The Votjas ver-
dict — which is final unless the 
case is reopened at the federal 
level — sparked the largest march 
in Pittsburgh history since the 
anti-war movement in the 1970s, 
according to Tim Stevens, presi­
dent of the Pittsburgh chapter of 
the NAACP.
Organizers of the rally, includ­
ing Gammage’s parents, Shell, 
and Stevens, met with acting 
United States Assistant Attor­
ney General William Lann Lee 
and other representatives from 
the Justice Department while 
protesters waited outside. In a 
press conference after the 90- 
minute meeting, Stevens said the 
Justice Department had prom­
ised to review its entire file on the 
Gammage case, which he said 
was “extremely thick.”
Mauri Saalakhan, executive 
director of the Peace and Justice 
Foundation in Silver Spring Md., 
who was also at the meeting, 
said he believed the Justice De­
partment was “genuinely con­
cerned,” and that he had expected
no further commit­
ment from the fed­
eral government at 
this time.
Some protesters, 
however, were skep­
tical of the Justice 
Department’s 
response, which 
sounded very simi­
lar to the response 
they gave last year. 
“It’s a slap in the 
face,” said Dave 
Welters, a member 
of the CCPJ. “If the 
Justice Department 
really thought there 
was something to 
be concerned with 
here, they would in­
vestigate it them­
selves.... They have 
the whole FBI to help them.”
One of the reasons the Justice 
Department has given for not in­
tervening in the case is that it is 
not yet locally resolved.
“I believe they are concerned 
about the case,” said Gammage’s 
father, Jonny Gammage Sr. “But 
there’s nothing they can do about 
it while it’s in the state courts.” 
It is uncertain whether the case 
for a Civil Rights violation is 
strong enough. The only wit­
nesses were police officers, and 
though a tow truck driver did 
testify as an eyewitness in the 
last two trials of Mulholland and 
Albert, his memory faltered in 
the second trial.
But new evidence has been ob­
tained since last year, according 
to Shell. Wayne Babish, former 
police chief of Brentwood during 
the Gammage incident who is cur­
rently suing the community for 
wrongful termination, has made 
public accusations of racism in 
the Brentwood police force.
Still, Stevens cautioned that
getting a case tried in federal court 
is not easy. The justice depart­
ment requires a lot of evidence 
before it is willing to enter into a 
case, he said.
Nevertheless, protesters vowed’ 
to return if the Justice Depart­
ment does not act this year. “l£ 
they don’t press charges, we’ll defi- 
nitely be back,” said Shell. “And- 
we’ll bring more people.”
“We should not be here [in- 
Washington]. I would much- 
rather be at home,” said Bailey.! 
“But you know what? I will be 
here next year if we have to.”
Stevens said the protests are 
important even if they don’t re­
sult in a federal conviction. “We’ve 
sent a message,” he said in a 
roundtable discussion on the 
CMU campus last Wednesday. 
“There’s a lot of rethinking going 
on in these police departments 
about how they operate as a re­
sult of this one death.” He also 
said he thought the case and the 
awareness it has raised will be 
good for race relations.
“A lot of people thought the 
Gammage case was racially divi­
sive. I think it was racially unify­
ing in a lot of ways,” he said. One 
of these ways has been the devel­
opment of the Black and White 
Reunion, a group bom out of the 
Votjas march, which seeks im­
proved communications between 
the white and black communities 
in Pittsburgh.
“Jonny Gammage’s death was 
terrible, and nobody wants to see 
it happen again, but Jonny 
Gammage has brought the city of 
Pittsburgh together,” said Keller, 
a member of the Reunion group.
Stevens said at the roundtable, 
“Any of you who have been at all- 
frustrated with this case, don’t 
forget that a lot has come out of 
this case, even if these men never 
serve a dav.”

CFA festival lacks 
adequate planning
Inadequate representation of 
CFA disciplines and ineffective 
publicity plagued the first 
Wats:on? festival held last year. 
As the organizers of the second 
annual Jill Watson Festival of 
the Arts gear up for this year’s 
festivities, it seems they didn’t 
learn much from the initial effort. 
Because of poor planning and lack 
of student input, this year’s 
Wats:on? festival will fall short of 
its goals to foster interaction 
among all schools in the College 
of Fine Arts and promote the arts 
in the CMU community.
Organizers did not gather 
enough faculty and student input 
in planning the event this year. 
Instead, a small group of CFA 
faculty selected the presenters, 
and only a handful of students 
were consulted late in the plan­
ning stages about the choices. The 
result of this limited discourse is 
a group of speakers that fails to 
adequately represent all CFA 
schools. Many presenters draw 
strongly from specific disciplines 
like architecture and music, while 
certain areas, such as communi­
cation design, have no represen­
tation. This contradicts the 
festival’s primary intention of in­
terdisciplinary collaboration.
The Wats:on? festival is clearly 
targeted at CFA students — two 
days of CFA classes will be can­
celed in order to attend the non­
mandatory Wats:on? events. The
College has every right to orga­
nize and promote an event tar­
geted mainly to its own students, 
but the festival contradicts 
CMU’s unwritten policy of can­
celing classes. It seems odd that a 
University which will not cancel 
one full day of classes for MLK 
Day will allow CFA to cancel two 
full days of their classes to cel­
ebrate a deceased alumnus and 
teacher. And while publicity for 
the event has increased aware­
ness among CFA students, the 
organizers have shown little con­
cern for explaining the nature of 
the event to those outside of CFA.
Last year’s Wats:on? Festival 
suffered from poor attendance, a 
problem that will not be resolved 
this year since the festival’s for­
mat remains relatively un­
changed and the group of speak­
ers does not adequately cover the 
various topics of interest present 
in CFA. If the festival were of­
fered in the classroom setting 
and attendance were mandatory, 
students would be more likely to 
benefit from the educational as­
pects of the festival.
Perhaps in the future, those 
who fund the Wats:on? festival 
should make sure that the plan­
ning committee produces a suc­
cessful event for the campus com­
munity as well as a celebration of 
the spirit of former CMU alum­
nus and adjunct professor 
Jili Watson.
Seniors fondly remember the 
Beaux Arts Ball as a grand cel­
ebration held in the artistically 
decorated College of Fine Arts 
building. The last Ball took place 
in the spring of their freshman 
year. Plagued by indecisive plan­
ning for the past four years, the 
Ball is in grave danger of disap­
pearing entirely. With the large 
amount of time that has elapsed 
between celebrations, soon there 
will be no one left who even knows 
what the Beaux Arts Ball is, let 
alone anyone who wants to orga­
nize it. The tradition of the Beaux 
Arts Ball is vital to this campus, 
and steps should be taken to en­
sure it does not become just an­
other piece of CMU folklore.
Every two years the Beaux Arts 
Ball transformed CFA into a hall 
of masks, inventive costumes, and 
dazzling mystique. Past Balls in­
cluded numerous bands, perfor­
mance artists, and impromptu art 
galleries spread throughout the 
building. The Beaux Arts Ball was 
one of the few student-planned 
events of this artistic magnitude 
to succeed in bridging the gap 
between students and colleges.
The responsibility of planning 
the Ball has been informally 
handed down through students 
year after year. Faced with the 
considerable duty of planning 
such a large event, the group was 
generally made up of highly moti­
vated, dedicated individuals. But
Students must revive 
Beaux Arts Ball
while the Ball was supposed to be 
held last spring, student plan­
ners dropped out of the project 
and the Ball was postponed.
Organizing the Ball is clearly a 
massive undertaking. It requires 
hard work, dedication, and en­
thusiasm to meet the goal. In the 
early 90s, Beaux Arts was heavily 
criticized as a rowdy, costly event 
that didn’t make as much of a 
profit as it was expected to. But if 
Beaux Arts is re-established, 
there is no reason why this stigma 
has to continue to be attached 
to it. If students work closely with 
Student Affairs to learn how 
to properly budget and plan for 
the Ball, the respect and appre­
ciation that students once felt for 
the event would return along 
with the CMU tradition of 
the celebration.
Students should start planning 
now while the memory and spirit 
of Beaux Arts are still present in 
the campus community. Gener­
ating student support through 
publicity and outlining a more 
structured financial plan with 
Student Affairs can help restore 
this important CMU legacy. The 
longer it takes for a group of driven 
students to stand up and accept 
the responsibility of maintaining 
this important element of cam­
pus culture, the less likely it is 
that students will ever have the 
chance to experience the tradi­
tion that once was Beaux Arts.

Letters to the Editor
Column ignores 
military realities
Editor:
In reading Yishan 
Wong’s morass of an 
Letter to editorial [“Military
Uahtfiïy Cerner Rn. ji
the Editormindset justifies 
abuse,” 2/16/98] my 
interpretive abilities were sorely tested. 
“Can he possibly be for real?” I wondered 
as I emerged from the slop, shaken. 
There are two ways of “reading” this 
particular piece of writing. Both are 
alarmingly problematic; neither reflects 
well on the author. On one hand, we 
could trust in Mr. Wong’s sincerity, be­
lieving that he is a proponent of the 
Draconian in terms of Armed Forces 
training methodology. Maybe he is say­
ing, in effect, “If Marines want to con­
duct barbaric rites of initiation, leave 
them alone. ‘Hazing’ is part of pack be­
haviors endemic to all successful mili­
tary organizations.” On the other hand, 
Mr. Wong might well be trying to adopt 
the role of the satirist, imbuing his work 
with not-so-cleverly-concealed irony.
Generations ago, notions of justice of­
ficially subjugated those of discipline 
within America’s military. The Uniform 
Code of Military Justice, signed into law 
by President Harry Truman in 1950, 
standardizes and codifies the means by 
which military legal matters are to be 
adjudicated. All military court decisions 
are subject to appellant processes. These 
may include numerous levels of judicial 
review, both military and civilian in 
nature, up to and including the U.S. 
Supreme Court. So if Mr. Wong believes 
that the military makes its own rules 
and administers its own brand of “jus­
tice,” he is mistaken. Hazing is forbid­
den; hazers are handled within param­
eters established by military law.
Mr. Wong refers to a case at Virginia 
Military Institute involving hazing of 
recruits. Fact is, young men and women 
who attend VMI are in no way formally 
tied to any branch of our military. Is Mr. 
Wong suggesting that civilians (i.e., stu­
dents at VMI) may ignore state and 
federal laws due to pseudo-military af­
filiation? If so, does he expect to be 
received with any semblance of credibil­
ity? He writes, “The military structure 
is, by necessity, one of pack dominance 
and personal command, with the de­
struction of the enemy the only goal.” 
But consider purely defensive/respon­
sive (and largely bloodless) roles adopted 
by our military in recent years in places 
like Liberia, Albania, Sierra Leone, the 
Congo, and Bosnia-Herzegovina. Con­
sider the conduct of humanitarian op­
erations, as successfully undertaken by 
Marines in Mogadishu, Somalia in 1992. 
Contrast these missions with Mr. Wong’s 
assessment: “the destruction of the en­
emy [is] the only goal.”
So Mr. Wong the Extremist, woefully 
out of touch with both what the military 
should constitute and what the military 
does constitute in America today, seeks 
to delude his audience. The real irony 
lies in the fact that an irresponsible, 
tactless, and ungracious author has dis­
paraged (intentionally or unintention­
ally) the very men and women who en­
sure the preservation of his right to 
express himself in print.

Buggy editorial 
insults Greeks
00Editor:
As an active mem­
ber of CMU, Sigma 
Tau Gamma, IFC, 
EMS, and many other 
student organizations,
Letter to 
the Editor
I feel compelled to respond to the edito­
rial published in the February 16 issue 
of The Tartan on the issue of Greek 
Funding for Carnival.
While the Editorial Board is entitled 
to its opinion, an editorial argument can 
only be effective if the facts and informa­
tion that the opinion is based on are 
correct and factual. In this case, the 
half-truths and fallacies The Tartan 
Editorial Board seems to have about 
Carnival, Greek organizations, and the 
finances of buggy and booth are so out- 
of-line as to border on mass delusion.
Student Senate has already recognized 
Greek organizations as legitimate stu­
dent organizations that can petition for 
Senate funding for special events.
Other student organizations restrict 
who has access to their buggy programs. 
I don’t think that, if I were to approach 
Spirit or CIA about joining their buggy 
programs, I would be accepted 
with open arms. Why then should 
Greek members subsidize the buggy
programs of organizations they cannot 
participate in?
Fraternity members already pay more 
for housing than other students. The 
dues for many houses are threatening to 
crush the financial ability of their mem­
bers to pay. Why then should Greek 
members be forced to not only pay for 
their own Carnival programs, but for 
others as well? Why doesn’t Spirit or 
CIA charge its members dues for their 
Carnival programs? Why should only 
Greek members be forced to pay twice?
[In the editorial, The Tartan Editorial 
Board said that Carnival will go on with­
out the Greeks if they choose not to 
participate.] This is by far the most 
insulting and short-sighted comment of 
your editorial. Greeks are Carnival.
To think otherwise is to deny basic 
math. In Booth, 18 out of the 28 partici­
pating organizations are fraternities or . 
sororities. In Buggy, if you go by number 
of buggies raced, Greek organizations 
race two-thirds of total buggies in both 
men’s and women’s competition. If you 
go by number of organizations partici­
pating, Greek organizations make up 
two-thirds of both men’s and women’s 
competitions. Booth numbers are from 
this year’s Spring Carnival webpage. 
Buggy numbers are from the 1995 race 
results. So unless you want a Spring 
Carnival which is only a third as big as 
last year’s, I suggest you appreciate the 
amount of time, effort, and dedication 
that Greek organizations put in, and 
the contribution they make to the 
CMU community.
Obviously the issue of funding Greek 
organizations for their Carnival activi­
ties is contentious and complicated. 
However, to base your argument on mis­
leading, incorrect, and plain wrong state­
ments encourages a rush to judgment 
that is prejudicial against the hard work 
and efforts of the Greek community.
As the sole newspaper for the CMU 
community, The Tartan has the ability 
to influence the thoughts and ideas of 
many of the CMU campus. When The 
Tartan Editorial Board publishes an 
editorial, it is assumed among its read­
ers that their arguments are based on 
good information. Unfortunately, it ap­
pears that The Tartan is less intere­
sted in facts and research than it is 
in yellow journalism.

ECEEnnui slows pace of social change
¦¿L______
Chris Cannon
Martin Luther King Jr. 
had a dream he wanted to 
share with you and Malcolm 
X would tell it to you straight, 
but these days, crusaders of 
civil change seem content if 
you just “Honk for Justice.” 
Last Friday in front of the 
Department of J ustice build­
ing in Washington, D.C., a 
group of about 50 protest­
ors, bused in from Pittsburgh 
and Syracuse, participated 
in the March for Justice II.
The march was scheduled to 
coincide with a meeting be­
tween the Department of Jus­
tice and NAACP and Pitts­
burgh community leaders, who 
are trying to get the federal 
investigators to investigate the 
Jonny Gammage case.
The small crowd consisted of 
blacks and whites of all ages, 
sometimes marching hand in. 
hand. The city brought in a 
handful of black cops to stand 
on the steps at the Depart­
ment of Justice, just in 
case the protestors got rowdy. 
The crowd was polite and or­
derly, only calling the officers
“pigs” a few times. It was 
all so politically correct you 
could puke.
I wasn’t expecting the level 
of intensity you hear about 
from the boycotts, marches, 
and riots of the 1960s. Like the 
original Civil Rights move­
ment, the Gammage protest­
ors seem to have a simple, sym­
pathetic cause: stop the police 
from killing people. But this 
protest seemed to be lacking in 
spirit. Almost half of the pro­
testors looked too tired to 
march. The sense of urgency 
had gone. It’s as if civil unrest 
has finally taken a rest.
What motivates people to 
demonstrate for a cause any­
way? These days, unless the 
local pro team brings home a 
championship, you won’t see 
thousands of people marching 
and rioting in the streets.
It’s easy to blame such in­
action on apathy, but the 
term is often misplaced. It’s 
more accurate to state that 
the farther we “progress” the 
easier it becomes to succumb 
to a grand ennui — every­
thing has already been done 
before anyway.
But subscribing to this belief 
Please see PROTEST, page 5

Spirit of social outrage fades into past
PROTEST, from page 4
will lead you to two fallacies: first, that 
all the big problems in society have been 
solved, and, second that things aren’t as 
bad as they once were.
We’re not asking our government to 
stop military movements against in­
nocent governments, or our own 
people, just stop taking foreign cam­
paign contributions. We’re not look­
ing to set up a national treasury or 
enfranchise the populace, just get bet­
ter health care. We’re no longer trying
to get blacks or women in the military, 
just gays.
But getting caught in these pitfalls 
downplays the causes and belittles the vic­
tims. Jonny Gammage is no less dead be­
cause only 50 and not 50,000 people found it 
important enough to march on Friday. But 
organizing marchers gets more difficult as 
people have fewer bad things coming their 
way. Why get out and march when you can 
sit safely at home emailing away in near 
anonymity, have the world beamed in via 
cable, and order from the J. Crew catalog
without fear of racism? Because of this, the 
question remains: How do you get mass 
numbers of people to protest in America?
The answer seems to be that you don’t. 
What’s worse is that it doesn’t seem to 
matter anyway. While about a dozen re­
porters swarmed to meet the lawyers rep­
resenting Gammage’s parents, the mem­
bers of the media and their cameras were 
idle as the protestors marched. I got the 
feeling the press would have been there 
whether there was any protest or not.
Increased media coverage has made it
hard to develop the necessary outrage to 
protest. We’re all becoming desensitized. 
It’s doubtless that we’d all be more upset 
with Gammage’s death if we hadn’t repeat­
edly seen the home video of Rodney King’s 
beating at the hands of the cops. It’s hard not 
to think that, with all the human interest 
stories and expanded coverage, our capacity 
for meaningful change has diminished.

Columnist calls for 
acceptance of gays
_________Abhay Agrawal
“Which would you prefer for 
your son or daughter: to be 
heterosexual, childless, and 
either unmarried or somewhat 
unhappily married; or to be 
homosexual, involved in a 
stable, happy relationship, and 
have children?” The New 
Yorker conducted a survey us­
ing this question for its Janu­
ary 5th issue and came up with 
rather interesting results.
This poll is significant be­
cause it represents main­
stream attitudes towards ho­
mosexuality. It targeted three 
groups of people — randomly 
selected adults, members of the 
economic elite, and subscrib­
ers to The New Yorker. Results 
indicate that for most of the 
randomly selected adults and 
economic elite, even hap­
piness and grandchildren 
would not be enough to make 
up for a son’s or daughter’s 
homosexuality.
Perhaps the people who pre­
ferred unhappy heterosexual 
children made that choice be­
cause they assumed that being 
homosexual means being un­
happy. I find it hard to believe 
that any good parent could 
want an unhappy child who is 
straight rather than a happy, 
gay child for any other reason 
than this misunderstanding. 
People are mixing up sexuality 
andjhappiness. Society needs 
to separate the two because 
they are different things. 
'Whether you’re straight or gay, 
you can be happy or unhappy. 
Since only 27 percent of the 
mainstream adults surveyed 
wanted a happy, gay kid, it is 
likely that most of the others 
did not fully understand the 
meaning of being gay. and be­
ing happy.
Had the question been, “Do 
you want a happy child or an 
unhappy child?” no one would 
have hesitated to answer that 
they wanted a happy child. 
Bring sexual orientation into 
it ;and the situation changes. 
What people are failing to rec­
ognize is that sexual orienta­
tion is just another part of our­
selves that we don’t choose, 
like our skin color, the shape of
our nose, or our height. People 
are forgetting this and elevat­
ing sexuality to a higher level, 
which is absolutely meaning­
less. Anyone would prefer a 
happy child, irrespective of 
whether his hair is brown or 
black or red. The same reason­
ing should apply to sexual ori­
entation. Somewhere along 
the line, -people have forgotten 
that homosexuality is not a 
choice and is not a reflection of 
one’s character.
Because of this lack of under­
standing, the majority of soci­
ety stigmatize people based on 
something they didn’t choose. 
This attitude manifests itself 
in laws that unfairly restrict 
the rights of homosexuals. For 
example, gay marriage is an 
issue which has been around 
for a long time. Basically, if two 
people love each other, they 
should have equal freedom to 
marry one another irrespective 
of their sexual orientation.
The right to equality is one of 
Americans’ fundamental rights. 
The fact that marriage is re­
stricted to people of opposing 
sexes is a direct violation of this 
right. Recently, the Florida 
Keys became the first county in 
the state to extend benefits to 
homosexual couples. Key West 
passed a measure to issue the 
equivalent of a marriage license 
to domestic partners who work 
for the city government. These 
changes do show a broadening 
of attitude. The gay marriage 
bill being contested in Hawaii 
(which would make Hawaii the 
first state to recognize same- 
sex marriages) is another ex­
ample of reform. However, more 
changes are needed to grant 
equality to every human being.
People shouldn’t have to fight 
to have equally applicable laws 
or licenses. We need to go fur­
ther than just granting mar­
riage licenses and fighting for 
bills. We need to overcome our 
hangups about sexual orienta­
tion and make all laws equally 
beneficial to all people. We need 
to step out of the Jurassic 
era and move into the 21st 
• century by granting equality 
to everyone.

Fanfare trivializes awareness
Amy Berger
Do you feel strongly about a 
cause? Do you want that cause 
and yourself taken seriously? 
Then do the cause a favor and, at 
all costs, avoid giving it its own 
special week or month. These 
commerorative blocks of time 
originated as publicity and edu­
cation attempts, but they’ve be­
come so common that they’ve done 
just the opposite. They*ve become 
jokes and don’t do justice to the 
achievements of the groups in 
the minority at CMU.
This month is not only Black 
History Month, but it’s also Jew­
ish Awareness Month. Does this 
mean that the whole of black his­
tory occurred and is occurring only 
in the month of February? Do 
people practice Judaism only one 
month out of the year, and during
Mary Tremonte/Tartan Junior
the shortest month at that? Obvi­
ously not. While I agree that it is 
important to learn whathappened 
in the past, whether it’s black his­
tory, women’s history, or break­
fast cereal history, I think it’s some­
thing more important than what 
can be encompassed in a mere 28 
days. Do people think that putting 
up a few posters about James 
Baldwin and Thurgood Marshall 
will educate the University com­
munity about the contributions of 
African Americans to this coun­
try? Hardly. Admittedly, there 
were a number of programs at 
CMU that focused on black writ­
ers and historians. Yet these pro­
grams should be given regularly, 
not just as a token effort because 
someone declared that black his­
tory was more significant if publi­
cized in February.
As part of Jewish Awamess 
Month, members of Hillel made 
buttons to express pride in their 
faith, and made extras to send to 
Jewish students in Moscow. 
I made some, because I 
thought sending buttons to 
Moscow as a symbol of reli­
gious brotherhood was a 
beautiful gesture, but on the 
pther hand, anyone can wear 
one for any reason.
March is Women’s History 
Month. I expect to see the 
same attention given to it as 
was given to February’s 
causes, and it will still be 
ridiculous, because women 
make history every day, not 
just in March. Their innova­
tions and contributions 
should be celebrated every 
day, especially at CMU, 
staff where women, like blacks,
are such an obvious minority. 
Maybe there’ll be a few pictures 
of Amelia Earhart and Marie Cu­
rie on the bulletin boards in the 
residence halls. And maybe, just 
maybe, someone will glance at 
one on their way to the bathroom.
This week is Eating Disorders 
Week. Again, while I do not at­
tack the cause itself, I think 
there’s a better way to go about 
publicizing the support and re­
sources that are available on this 
campus. Eating disorders are se­
rious, even lethal, illnesses that 
need to be addressed so people 
know that they don’t have to suf­
fer alone and that help is avail­
able. This is precisely why I 
think support groups and educa­
tional programs should be publi­
cized often.
While all of these are noble 
causes, the labels for weeks and 
months have truly become a farce. 
What’s next — Plastic Cutlery 
Awareness Week? Don’t throw 
them out! Plastic Cutlery are 
people too! Where will it end? Soon 
everything and everyone will have 
a special time period that doesn’t 
mean anything.
Having a special time devoted to 
a cause isn’t what promotes it or 
encourages others to get involved. 
What accomplishes that are the 
people who feel so strongly about 
these causes that they carry them 
inside themselves not for one 
month or one week, but every day, 
trying to enlighten others when­
ever they can.

Regulation weakens French economy
Dash Boyer-Olson
For the last few years, the people 
of France have faced extremely 
high levels of unemployment. In 
response to this epidemic of job­
lessness, union leaders have be­
gun to call for a shorter work week 
while keeping the same level of 
wages. The reasoning is that busi­
nesses will need to hire more work­
ers while the current employees 
retain their current pay. This 
would theoretically create more 
jobs without decreasing the wages 
of those who now have jobs.
Amazingly, this idea has picked 
up the support of French Prime
Minister Lionel Jospin. He recently 
stated that he would like to reduce 
the work week to 35 hours by the 
year 2000, and eventually to 32 
hours. The Prime Minister’s state­
ments have been praised by the 
unemployed and criticized by busi­
ness leaders. The plan sounds very 
nice in theory, but I believe there 
are many reasons to doubt the 
success of such a policy.
The proposal to cut the number 
of hours in the workweek repre­
sents more government regulation 
on business, by which I mean both 
small businesses and large corpo­
rations. France and other Euro­
pean countries have traditionally 
favored more government involve­
ment in the economy than has the 
United States. However, U.S. jobs
have expanded eight percent in 
the last five years, compared to 
only three percent for France. As 
France faces record levels of un­
employment, one would think that 
the French would try to govern 
their economy more like the U.S. 
rather than move further away 
from it. Government regulation 
has not produced positive results 
for the French economy in years, 
and now there is a call for more 
regulation. Maybe it is time for 
France to lessen government regu­
lations on business.
Another problem that I see with 
the French plan to create more 
jobs is that it punishes business 
owners, who are the creators of 
jobs. By lowering the number of

Limits impair economic plan
EMPLOYMENT, from page 5
hours that employees work per 
week while keeping the pay con­
stant, the net effect is an increase 
in the wage paid per hour. When 
businesses must pay higher wages, 
they often downsize to reduce costs, 
thus reducing the total number of 
employees. When confronted with 
higher wages, how many busi­
nesses are going to hire more em­
ployees? The only way that I can 
possibly see them hiring more 
workers under this scenario would 
be if the government offered a sub- 
¿idy to those that did so. However,
a subsidy would require the gov­
ernment to fond the employment 
of the new workers. Wouldn’t it 
make more sense to spend money 
to promote business so that new 
jobs could be created through ex­
pansion? Instead, the government 
seems to want to create jobs artifi­
cially. At a time when the govern­
ment should be encouraging busi­
ness expansion, it is instead inter­
fering with it.
Finally, how fair is the French 
program to business? Should gov­
ernment be able to set such a low 
limit on the number of hours that
employees can work? A reduc­
tion of the number of hours in 
the work week by almost 20 per­
cent is certainly a major change 
to force businesses to adjust to. 
Business owners would earn less 
money, and there would thus be 
fewer jobs available for workers.
France might want to take the 
thrivingU.S. economic policy un­
der consideration before adopt­
ing such radical change.

Before most of us were even 
born, some people got together 
and started this new art form. 
People were spinning on their 
heads, making simulated drum 
beats with their mouths, and even 
spray painting their names on 
city structures in an artistic and 
original manner. Mobil eDJs were 
draining the power out of city 
park lamps and playing records 
and people did this thing where 
they would kinda talk over the 
beat. It wasn’t just talking, but 
talking a poem, to a rhythm, and 
everyone really dug the whole 
vibe. Holding it down for the black 
aesthetic, what is now called hip- 
hop is a direct manifestation of 
verbal, physical, and artistic ele­
ments inherited from the 1960s 
Black Arts Movement, the 
Harlem Renaissance, and the 
rhythm/griot culture of Africa.
Flashback to your early teens. 
MC Hammer is doing the Type­
writer all over your TV, and ev­
eryone is wearing baggy polka- 
dot pants and breaking their legs 
doing that clever Kid ’n Play move. 
Something that was just a South 
Bronx thing, and then a New York 
thing, had exponentially grown 
into an American pop-culture 
thing. It was all good, that is, 
until the Sugar Bear, Zack the 
Lego Maniac, and Hamburger 
Helper thought they could rap. 
The creation of Rappin’ Rockin’ 
Barbie and Ken, equipped with 
thick gold chains and a boombox, 
was the clincher in a sure testa­
ment to the transformation of 
culture to profitable trend.
Popular culture’s absorption of 
hip-hop, operating within the con­
text of American capitalism, has, 
in many ways, severed the music 
from its roots. Because this 
country’s economic system super­
sedes its moral system, compa­
nies and institutions have no 
qualms about disrespecting the 
culture of a minority for their
own personal enjoyment and 
profit. Atlanta Braves fans re­
fused to give up their precious 
Tomahawk Chop even when Na­
tive Americans marched and pro­
tested that the use of the Toma­
hawk Chop as a sports team logo 
was blatantly offensive and dis­
respectful. Museums across this 
country contain valuable pieces 
of African and Eastern art, which 
are kept behind glass walls for 
the American public to look at, 
detached from their original pur­
pose and spiritual meaning. Simi-
hop artist if one is expressing 
someone else over yet another 
person’s beat without changing a 
damn thing?
Now, so-called hip-hop is filled 
with energy-less rappers rhym­
ing the most basic rhyme schemes 
on over-sampled beats. They say 
the same things everyone else 
says; people are always doing the 
same thing in the videos with 
clothes shining so bright you can­
not look directly into the TV. 
Oftentimes, you cannot tell the 
difference between two of their
larly, I guess, a CMU fraternity 
recently thought it would be 
“phat” to have a simulated crime 
scene on the floor with tape trac­
ing around a dead body so people 
could be in “hip-hop land,” danc­
ing and having fun. But homicide 
is a real problem in the African- 
American community, one that 
many artists do express in hip- 
hop songs.
One can listen to a mainstream 
album, labeled as “hip-hop,” in 
which the person who is rapping 
calls himself a “hip-hop” artist 
but raps someone else’s lyrics. 
The person listening to the music 
calls himself a hip-hop head but 
fails to understand that, as Dre 
from Outkast says, “That ain’t 
hip-hop, you find that shit in the 
gift shop.” The person on the al­
bum is not a hip-hop artist; he or 
she is an actor. Otherwise, this 
person would be original and say 
what they have to say. It’s all 
about originality and expression, 
so how can one call oneself a hip-

videos. There is little difference 
between Puffy’s “More Money, 
More Problems” and “Bad Boys,” 
as there is between the Roots’ 
“Never Do What They Do” and 
“CLONES.” I am not dissing 
anyone’s musical preference; I am 
simply stating that this music is 
so far disconnected from turn­
tables, breakdancing, and emcee 
battles that it can hardly be 
called hip-hop anymore. Hip-hop 
does not recognize it, and real 
hip-hop heads recognize that it is 
not hip-hop.
When people that truly respect 
and manifest hip-hop (in its basic 
principle of originality and ex­
pression), come to the forefront of 
the industry, real heads can 
breathe a sigh of relief: Our voice, 
our culture, our aesthetic will not 
fade into memory because of 
corny, pop, bubble-gum trends.

PRECAUTIONS
General
Local skin reactions such as erythema, erosion, excoriation/flaking, and edema are common. Should severe local skin reaction occur, the cream should be removed by washing the treatment area with mild soap and water. Treatment with 
Aldara cream cun be resumed after the skin reaction has subsided. There is no clinical experience with Aldara crcam 
therapy immediately following the treatment of genital/perianal warts with other cutaneously applied drugs; therefore, Aldara cream administration Is not recommended until genital/perianal tissue is healed from any previous drug or 
surgical treatment. Aldara has the potential to exacerbate inflammatory conditions of the skin.
Information for Patients
Patients using Aldara 5% cream should receive the following information and instructions: The effect of Aldara 5% cream on the tnmsmission of genital/perianal warts is unknown. Aldara 5% cream may weaken condoms and vaginal

In controlled clinical trials, the most frequently reported adverse reactions Were those of local skin and application site reactions: some patients also reported systemic reactions: TTicse reactions were usually mild to moderate in intensity, however, severe reactions were reported with 3X/weck application. These reactions were more frequent and 
more intense with daily application than with 3X/week application. Overall, in the 3X/week application clinical studies, 1.20?- f4/327) of the patients discontinued due to local skin/application site reactions. Tnc incidence and 
severity of local skin reactions during controlled clinical trials are shown in'thc following table.

CARNEGIE MELLON POLICY ON UNIVERSITY FINAL EXAMINATIONS 
PREAMBLE
The Faculty Senate adopted the following policies on the administration of final examinations for the undergraduate courses 
(defined as courses that arc numbered 6xx or below). These policies represent an understanding between faculty and student 
concerning an important but often stressful period at the conclusion of each academic semester. There should be no expecta­
tion that the following points will cover every conceivable situation. The student should anticipate the demands of the end-of- 
semester schedule, plan accordingly and early, and be prepared. The faculty should recognize that the student is encumbered 
with many tightly orchestrated and intensive obligations during this period over which he or she has no control: expectations 
should be reasonably consistent with the number of course units and, of course, should be made known to the student well in 
advance of the final examination period.
DEFINITIONS
•The university’s official final examination period begins on the Monday immediately following the last day of classes and 
continues through the last day of scheduled final examinations, with the exception of reading day(s).
• Scheduled final examinations are those scheduled by Enrollment Services. An instructor may choose not to fix a schedule for 
the final examination, but instead allow each student to choose the examination time; such exams are called self-scheduled 
examinations.
• Final examinations can either be comprehensive, covering all course materials, or non-comprehensive, covering only a part 
of the course.
POLICIES
1. All scheduled final examinations arc held at the end of the semester during the university’s official final examination period. 
Comprehensive final examinations are not required for each course, but are given at the option of the department or instruc­
tor. The reading day and weekend preceding the examination days shall never be used for examination purposes of any kind, 
unless a student opts to take a self-scheduled examination during this time. Nort-comprehcnsivc final examinations or final 
projects (but not both) are allowed during this final examination period only in courses that do not give a final comprehensive 
examination.
2. Instructors are expected to return all work assigned no later than 72 hours before the final examination in the course. In 
cases when this is not possible, an answer key, solution sets or equivalent feedback should be provided unless the final examina­
tion will not cover material in work that has not been returned.
3. No other coursework, including laboratory or studio work, will be due during the final examination period unless it is 
assigned in advance and in lieu of the course’s final examination. Regardless of whether there is a final examination in the 
course, no classes other than review sessions shall be held during the final examination period. Review sessions should be 
scheduled for optimal attendance, and a serious effort should be made to accommodate students who cannot attend. In
OC
o£
appreciation of the time required to prepare for final examinations, no other examinations, portfolio reviews, critiques or juries 
shall be scheduled within four days of the final examination of the same course.
4. Instructors shall never exert or submit to pressures to move an examination so that people can leave earlier nor pressure 
students to take an examination on a reading day or weekend preceding examinations.
20
5. No student is required to take more than two scheduled examinations that start within a 24-hour period. A student who has' 
more than two examinations scheduled within a 24-hour period or has two examinations scheduled at the same time should “' 
contact first the instructor of the course for assistance in resolving conflicts. If the problem cannot be resolved by that means,' - 
the student should contact the associate dean of his or her home college.
6. Take-home final examinations shall be given for any 24-hour period of the student’s choosing during the final examination/
period. . • TO
' ¡V; ¦ Oo7. Students are expected to present themselves at the place assigned at the start of the examination; late arrival will reduce th^r 
total time a student has to complete the examination, unless instructor’s course policy indicates otherwise. Instructors reserve - 
the right to require attendance within a specific time period. Students who miss an examination with a reasonable excuse and 
wish to petition for a make-up final examination should check with the instructor. Instructors are encouraged to include late 
arrival policy and make-up exam policy in the course syllabus.
8. Any student shall be permitted to review his or her corrected, graded final examination in the presence of an instructor or ar 
teaching assistant. Any controversy arising from this review shall be dealt with in accordance with the university procedure for 
the appeal of grades and academic actions. A final examination which is not returned to a student will be kept available for a 
year for review. In the event that the instructor or teaching assistant is not available for the review, the responsibility shall rest?, 
with the department head of the instructor offering the course or his or her designee. Since instructors are expected to return . 
all work assigned before the final examinations, they are not responsible for retaining unclaimed coursework.
9. Concerns related to final examination, complaints about violations of the final examination policy or alterations of the finjir 
examination schedule should be directed to the department head of the instructor offering the course or to the associate dean ' ;' 
of the student’s home college.
CONTACT
Questions concerning this policy or its intent should be directed to: Edmond Ko, Vice Provost for Education, x8-5865.

Squad improves at invitational
By MARSHALL WARFIELD d
Dossier Literary Co-Editor
One of the buses got lost on the way to 
the Kent State Invitational on Saturday, 
but the Carnegie Mellon indoor track 
team showed plenty of direction as they 
survived a very unorganized meet.
“Competitors ranged from seventh 
graders to 70 year olds,” said senior Jes­
sica Connolly, commenting on the meets 
open registartion. As a result, there were 
no team scores for this meet and how 
CMU placed is not known.
Nonetheless, the Tartans showed im­
provement in many areas. A school record 
was broken, and many CMU athletes 
stepped up their performance to fortify 
the team before UAAs.
Senior Kerry Riley set a new school 
record with a throw of 34’ 8” in the shot 
put. She also ran for 9:26, placing third 
in the 55m hurdles.
Junior Maureen McGranaghan and se­
nior Melissa Lott dominated the 5k dis­
tance race. McGranaghan and Lott placed 
first and second with 17:47 and 17:49 
respectively. These times also put them 
in the top ten in the nation for Division
III. Sophomores Andrea Bums and Eliza­
beth Currid placed first andsecond in the 
3k with 11:00 and 11:27 respectively.
For the men distance runners, sopho­
more Bryan Meyer finished second in the 
5k with 15:30. He was followed by team­
mate sophomore Kenn Oldham at 15:38 
for third place. In the 3k, junior Kelan 
Wieloch ran 9:13 for 2nd place. Junior 
Kristo Kriechbaum placed third with 9:15.
The bus arrived at Kent State 45 min­
utes late, but no player missed an event. 
By 2pm, the meet was two hours behind 
schedule. Sometimes the delays inter­
fered with the timing between warmups 
and events. “I can’t blame my perfor­
mance on delays, but I know it hurt the 
jumps of some of our guys,” ” said senior 
Chris Pesci. Sophomore Todd Kozuki 
jumped 6’ 2” in the high jump. Freshman 
Mike Halloran jumped 6’0. Kozuki came 
back to jump 41’ 7” in the triple jump.
Freshman Matt Gustin tried again this 
week to fill a gap left by Stephen Wetter 
in the shot put. Wetter broke his hand 
and is unable to throw for the team. “My 
technique’s getting better, but I have to 
work on consistency,” said Gustin. Jun­
ior Margaret Powers tried to qualify for 
Nationals in the mile but fell short with 
a time of 5:19. Additionally, senior Rosie 
Perez’ shot put did not measure up to the 
one she threw last week. “This was 
definitely not the confidence builder I 
needed before conference,” said Perez.
Marshall Warfield/Dossier Literary Co-Editpr 
Junior Margaret Powers sprints to the finish.
Kent State does mark the end of the' 
road for the team. There is still a meet at 
Slippery Rock next weekend, UAAs are 
in two weeks, and farther down the road 
is the National Competition.
“The team needs to stay healthy” said 
Coach Dario Donatelli. “The team needs 
to use the Slippery Rock meet to iron out 
any kinks. . . its important that we all 
focus on what we do best,” said Riley. r._
CMU hosts conference swimmers
VISITORS, from page 12
races. Monitors were also installed in 
spectator areas since viewing areas 
were limited.
Maser said that although nothing 
major went wrong during the four-day 
conference, spectators were somewhat 
confused at the lack of seating when 
they arrived on Wednesday and Thurs­
day. “You’d see them walking around, 
lookingfor the best spot,” she said. “They 
sort of had to adjust. After that, though, 
they settled in and found where they 
wanted to be.”
The only moment of concern for con­
ference planners came on Thursday 
and Friday, when the scoreboard 
started to malfunction. The scoreboard 
would not display lane four’s data cor­
rectly until a repairman arrived and 
fixed the equipment.
“It was just really great,” said Maser. 
“The teams did well; it was really a 
group effort between the teams, Cater­
ing, IT, the University Center staff, the 
cleaning service, and the students.” The 
CMU Crew Team, Maser said, provided 
the bulk of student help, acting as tim­
ers and working the coat check on the 
second floor of the UC.
“It’s been busy with people buying 
heat sheets, and we sold out of t-shirts,” 
said Erin Tocknell, a sophomore En­
glish major who was working at the 
second-floor coat check on Saturday 
evening. “Not too many people are 
checking their coats,” she said, point­
ing to the near-empty room behind her.
“I like the UAAs, though — I think 
they’re good for the University.”
CMU will host the 2002 UAA swim­
ming championships as well, as part of a- 
four-year cycle with Emory, Washing^ 
ton University, and University of RoctF 
ester. The four schools, which are the 
only ones in the division with proper 
facilities, will continue in this cycle untit 
the other division schools have facilities 
able to support the UAA conference. 
CMU planners, however, aren’t worried! 
about the next round.
“There wasn’t anything particularly 
difficult about the conference,” said. 
Maser. “And a lot of what was difficult 
was because it was the first time. Now, 
we know what works and what didn’t 
work quite the way we wanted it to.” •

UAAs bring out best in athletes
RECORDS, from page 12
Despite the incredible times, 
the Tartan women were eclipsed 
by NYU in the standings and 
slipped into fifth place. The men 
remained in third place and hoped 
to make a final challenge against 
Emory on Saturday.
The real story of the meet, how­
ever, may extend beyond the med­
als and statistics. The fact that 
every swimmer hit their personal 
best, no matter what place they 
finished, was an extraordinary 
achievement in itself. “We were 
swimming to the level of our ex­
pectations and beyond,” said 
freshman breaststoker Jason 
Striner. It was an event of per­
sonal bests, team unity, and tre­
mendous sportsmanship. Scenes 
like CMU swim coach David 
Belowich jumping in the air ex­
claiming: “Two school records!” 
and a dozen Tartan swimmers at 
the end of the pool screaming and 
cheering their teammates to vic­
tory were commonplace.
“The excitement from the loud 
noise in the pool area made us kick 
ass in the water,” said Alpert. “[It] 
just pumps you up.”
“The cheering as well as the fans 
at the end of the lanes for my breast­
stroke races psyches me up to a very 
extreme level,” said Striner.
The final day of competition so­
lidified rankings of the teams and 
continued to re-write the record 
books. Junior John Murray, fresh­
men Nathan Palm and George 
Heidinger, McGuire, Kondo, 
Tseng, and others finished the 
year on an extremely positive note 
as the meet ended with 37 of 38 
pool records falling.
Possibly the most emblematic 
event of the entire meet was the 
final swim, the men’s 200m 
freestyle relay. By that time, the 
scores had been decided. To the 
common observer, there was very 
little left to swim for. But that was 
impossible to tell by the way the 
athletes swam. Nearly every swim­
mer from all eight schools sur­
rounded the edge of the pool. There 
seemed to be a feeling of exhilara­
tion throughout the arena, and it 
was particularly difficult for the
officials to achieve silence for the 
start of the race. Once the race 
began, the Tartans did not fail the 
home crowd. The relay team con­
sisting of Foster, freshman Mike 
Robinson, Alpert, and McGuire 
swam, in the words of Belowich, in 
an electrifying race en route to 
decimatingthe old pool record. The 
Tartans concluded the Champion­
ships with a first-place finish.
“It really is gratifying and excit-
Heidinger. Harvey credits the 
strength in the team’s underclass­
men, superior senior talent, and 
the abilities of Belowich as main 
factors in the team’s success;. 
“Belowich knows how to get a lot 
.from the talent he has.”
Belowich is extremely happy with 
the team’s performance. He credits’ 
the swimmers’ dedication and com­
mitment, their confidence in him^ 
and, most importantly, the high
Lisette IVliller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager- 
Swimmers cheered on their teammates throughout the four-day event.
ing to have all the work and prac­
tice and time and energy that we 
have put in day after day since 
August to finally pay off, and pay off 
in a big way,” said Heidinger.
As expected, Johns Hopkins 
University came away with first 
place finishes in both the men’s 
and women’s categories. Carnegie 
Mellon had one of the strongest 
showings in team history as the 
men improved by two places over 
last year’s fifth-place finish and 
the women came off of their first 
winning season ever, missing 
fourth place by only 42 points to 
New York University.
The highlight of the entire event 
for Carnegie Mellon may have been 
after the meet when McGuire was 
awarded with swimmer of the year 
honors for the entire UAA. It 
capped off an extraordinary sea­
son for the senior, who has seen 
numerous records broken and goals 
met and surpassed.
“CMU has been out-performing 
everyone’s expectations,” said
goals that the team set for them­
selves at the beginning of the sea­
son as keys to the Tartans’ success.
“I’m seeing what can be. It 
was a matter of convincing; 
the swimmers what they can; j 
achieve,” he said.
The season may not be over for 
some swimmers. Based on theii® 
times at the Championships'^ 
many top UAA swimmers will be, 
competing in the national chani-- 
pionships next month. The quali-! 
fying times will be released in the j 
next few weeks and a number of 
Tartan swimmers are hopeful that! 
they will get the nod.
As for next season, Belowich-; 
admits that the loss of seniors like; 
Foster, McGuire, women’s captain j 
Chandra Wheeler, Melissa; 
Murello, and others will be tough; 
to overcome. However, he is en-' 
thusiastic about the strong fresh-; 
man and sophomore classes step-1 
ping up to leadership roles on the J 
team and looks forward to an oflr-i 
season of recruiting.

Potential rule changes threaten spirit of game
On Net
by Jessica Strelitz
; It was just a few years ago when every­
one was bitching about how terrible the 
goaltending in the NHL was. Players 
racked up the points, and games ended 
with huge goal totals. The fans blamed 
expansion. The administration blamed 
the feeder systems. Starting goalies were 
shooting in and out of the big leagues 
faster than Team USA could tear up a 
room in the Olympic Village.
Well, whatever was broken then is 
fixed now, and it’s too good to be true. 
Games are so low scoring these days 
that the NHL owners have proposed 
some changes to open up the ice again — 
starting immediately after the Olympic 
break. As usual, it’s all about money. 
The red light flashing above the goalie’s 
cage brings the crowds, not an OT game 
with awesome defense.
- The NHL Board of Governors has pro­
posed making life hell for NHL defen­
sive squads by restricting the goalie, 
eliminating the red line, moving the net 
around, making break-outs impossible, 
and adding a fourth official to help call 
tighter restraints on hooking, holding,
and basically anything that gets in the 
way of the puck carrier.
I do agree that some of these proposed 
changes are necessary. The top concern 
that the Board addressed was the recent 
rash of major penalties, especially knee­
ing. Since many of the kneeing inci­
dents, most notably the ones involving 
Rick Tocchet of the Phoenix Coyotes, 
have caused players severe injury, the 
Board proposed that an automatic game 
misconduct would be assessed to any 
player who received a major penalty for 
kneeing in a game. Fair, I say. Hopefully 
it will make some players think twice 
before cracking someone.
But, let me get started. A fourth offi­
cial is unnecessary. As it is, 
there are three extra sets 
of eyes on the ice, making 
it hard to get away with 
much. Four would 
just make things 
slower. It would 
lead to more 
contested 
calls, more 
people in the 
way of a 
break away, 
and more 
people on 
the payroll 
increasing 
ticket prices.
The goaltender equip- 
ment question came 
about last year when 
Garth Snow of the Phila­
delphia Flyers was ac­
cused of wearing oversized padding. 
This led to a debate over padding rules 
and regulations on size, something that 
I thought had a set of measurements 
already, since refs were dragging Snow 
off the ice and checking leg pads with 
friggin’ tape measures. And in addi­
tion, if the goalie moves to the puck on 
an icing call, even to control it, the 
icing is null and void. Keeping the 
tender in his cage more isn’t that bad 
of an idea for some, but
to restrict his movements entirely may 
make the game sloppy.
For the latter part of the American 
Hockey League and International 
Hockey League seasons, the Board will 
be demoing and studying a variety of 
radical changes to see if they could be 
used in the NHL next year. These in­
clude, and hold your breath, goaltenders 
not being able to handle the puck be­
hind the goal line; a quick face-off for 
stoppage in the neutral zone, with no 
line changes permitted; minor penal­
ties being served in their entirety; a 
player with the puck on the 
defending team not being 
permitted to stop behind his 
net in the defensive zone and 
moving the goal line further 
from the end boards — creat- 
a total distance of 11 feet. 
OK, digest and react.
At least the Board admits 
that these proposed 
changes need further 
study before they are 
formally presented 
as new rules. Some 
of them will speed 
up the game and 
c e.r t a i n 1 y 
make it 
much easier 
to score. But 
others will 
change the 
players’ entire
thinking schemes on the game; espe­
cially when you’re talking about not al­
lowing players to set up behind this new 
huge space behind the net and start a 
break-out. That will force play, not ac­
cent the sport.
Minor penalties would be just like 
majors, except shorter — score all you 
want, they can’t get out of the box any­
way. I suppose that they are trying to cut 
down on penalties by using scare tactics 
but if they implement that rule, then 
having a fourth official on the ice is even 
more ridiculous.
And the last change that the Board is 
going to try out in some 1998-99 pre­
season games is the elimination of the 
red line, which would eliminate most 
offside calls for two-line passes. Damn 
let those boys run with the puck. Why 
don’t they eliminate defenders all to­
gether? Hell, why don’t we duct tape the-1 
goalie to the net and have him kick at; 
penalty shots, instead of the traditional: 
overtime period? Danger, fun, and high, 
scoring for sure!
There is still a chance to save hockey 
before adding our own designated hitter, 
and shot-clock; two-thirds of the big­
wigs still have to approve the changes' 
this summer. I hope that the NHLPA- 
and general managers hear my plea — 
save the sport while you can!

time they began to suffer a minor scoring 
drought. It was more than four minutes before 
the Tartans scored again but after that they 
were able to effectively dominate Chatham.
CMU ran up the score to 34-2 when, with 
five minues left, Chatham scored for the 
first time since the beginning of the game.
Chatham was able to add a few more points 
to their score in the remaining minutes, 
but continued to suffer on defense. At the 
half, Carnegie Mellon was winning by a 
score of 45-8.
The second half was much like the first. The 
Tartans didn’t slow down at all, and Chatham 
was never able to generate any offense to 
speak of. By the end of the game, Carnegie 
Mellon had beaten Chatham in most every 
statistical category of significance. CMU had 
22 more rebounds than Chatham, and while 
the Tartans were able to earn 29 assists to 
their 10 turnovers, Chatham had 29 turn­
overs and nine assists.
The final score was 91-19. Carnegie Mellon 
can now move on to their remaining two 
games of the season. For the next game the 
Tartans will travel to New York state to face 
the University of Rochester. Afterwards the 
team will return home to face Emory for their 
final game. Both teams are University Ath­
letic Association opponents. CMU has beaten Stacey Tetziaff/Tartan Photo staff

their 17 point loss of a few 
weeks ago, but the friendly con­
fines of Skibo Gym didn’t make 
up for 18 turnovers, more than in 
the first game.
; Carnegie Mellon now stands at 
4-8 in the UAA and 9-13 overall.

the season will all be difficult for 
CMU. Two games are away at the

Record-setting season ends
By BRIAN SMITH
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Imagine a room of over 350 ath­
letes screaming, cheering, and 
chanting in unison. Now add 200 
spectators, 30,000 gallons of wa­
ter, and 39 shattered records. Mul­
tiply that energy and enthusiasm 
by four days, and you have an idea 
of the scene in the University Cen­
ter from last Wednesday through 
Saturday, when Carnegie Mellon 
played host to the 1998 University 
Athletic Association Swimming 
and Diving Championships.
The meet marked one of the first 
times Carnegie Mellon has show­
cased its athletic facilities to the 
UAA on a large scale. It was also 
the first time the two-year old Uni­
versity Center pool was used for a 
regional event. “We don’t feel we’ve 
done our part in the UAA as far as 
hosting events like this because of 
a lack of facilities,” said Carnegie
Mellon Athletic Director John 
Harvey. “Now that we have the 
opportunity to host such a large 
event ... the Carnegie Mellon 
campus in general will benefit from 
the exposure.”
The championships brought 
eight top Division III schools to 
Pittsburgh, including Emory, 
Johns Hopkins, New York Univer­
sity, the University of Chicago, 
Brandeis, Washington University, 
and the University of Rochester. 
Johns Hopkins came into the event 
with a near decade of dominance in 
the men’s competition, and the 
Emory women were three-time 
defending champions.
The meet opened with prelimi­
nary diving events on Wednesday, 
where Carnegie Mellon junior Sam 
Malloy qualified for the finals. The 
swim competition began Thurs­
day. It was then that pool records 
began to fall. “This is the fastest

four years, and probably ever,” said 
senior Jake McGuire.
In the 10 events held on Thurs­
day, every single pool record was 
broken, and many times the sec­
ond and even third place swim­
mers eclipsed the old marks. The 
Johns Hopkins men and women 
established a first place standing 
early in the evening and Carnegie 
Mellon, Emory, and NYU battled 
for the second place spot. Senior 
Mike Foster, first year student Jon 
Alpert, sophomore Mike Robinson, 
and McGuire came away with the 
first top-three CMU finish of the 
meet in the second event — the 
men’s freestyle relay. “Every swim­
mer had at least one good swim,” 
said Alpert.
Thursday also saw first place 
victories by McGuire in the men’s 
individual medley, and second 
place finishes by first year student 
Julie Tseng in the 500m freestyle 
and the relay team of junior Jenni­
fer Skuly, sophomore Erin 
Rockwell, Tseng, and first year 
student Melissa Schmelzer.
Friday opened with Johns 
Hopkins leading both the men’s 
and women’s competitions 
and Emory in second. The Tartan 
men were close behind Emory 
and the women were in fourth 
behind Washington.
The incredible times continued, 
and CMU turned in 10 top-three 
finishes, highlighted by first place 
performances by the women’s800m 
freestyle relay team of Schmelzer, 
Skuly, Rockwell, and Tseng. 
Rockwell also earned the top spot in 
the women’s 100m breaststroke.

American effort yields 
mixed Olympic results
Nagano 1998
By PETER PATTERSON
Tartan Staffwriter
With the crowning of the Czech 
Republic as the men’s ice hockey gold 
medalists early Sunday morning, the 
contests of the XVIII Winter Olym­
piad came to a close. By now, the light 
from the Olympic flame has been 
doused for another two years, and 
David Letterman’s mother will also 
have to wait for the 2000 summer 
games to do more correspondence 
work. The 1998 games of Nagano, 
Japan were exciting and often unpre­
dictable. The last week of competi­
tion was as good as it gets.
Figure skating is considered by 
many to be the marquee event of the 
winter Olympics. In particular, the 
women’s competi­
tion is a favorite 
with the fans. The 
presence of these 
young ladies in 
shiny outfits per­
forming athleti­
cally superb and 
artistically breath­
taking routines 
always attracts 
the attention of the world.
The ice skating competition was ex­
pected to be the coronation of 17-year- 
old American skater Michelle Kwan. 
The 1996 World Champion was the 
overwhelming favorite for the gold 
after an astounding performance in 
the U.S. Nationals last month, when 
seven of eight judges awarded her 
perfect scores for artistic presenta­
tion. She did nothing to discount this 
opinion in the short program, leading 
fellow American Tara Lipinski going 
into the long program.
All Kwan needed to do in the long 
program to secure the highest spot on 
the medal stand was skate to her 
ability. She gave a brilliant perfor­
mance, but one slip on the landing of 
a triple jump left the door open for 
Lipinski. The 15-year-old American 
skater proceeded to skate the pro­
gram of her life. The 4'11" 82 pounder 
has always been a great jumper, but
this time she combined this aspect with 
a fine artistic performance, an element 
often considered lacking from her pro­
gram. Her scores were good enough 
to edge Kwan, who had to settle for 
the silver medal. Lipinski had also 
previously upset Kwan at the 1997 
World Championships.
While the United States could be 
proud of the performance of their figure 
skaters, finishing 1-2 for the first time 
since 1956, the same can’t be said for 
their counterparts on the men’s ice 
hockey team. Team USA, stocked with 
NHL players and coming off a 1996 
World Cup championship in a similarly 
constructed tournament, was widely 
expected to make a serious run at the 
gold medal. Their main challengers 
were thought to be Canada and Swe­
den. Not only did none 
of these teams win 
gold, none even came 
away with a medal. 
Sweden and the U.S. 
were knocked out in 
the first round of 
elimination, ending 
all hopes for a medal. 
Canada got a shot 
at the bronze but 
could not manage to defeat Finland for 
the third prize.
While the favorites struggled, Russia 
and the Czech Republic thrived in 
Nagano. The Russians stormed unde­
feated into the championship game, 
while the Czechs’ only loss was to the 
Russians. The game meant more than 
just revenge for a round robin loss to the 
Russians earlier in the Olympics for the 
Czechs. In previous Olympics, Russia 
had thwarted the gold medal hopes of 
the Czechs, winning 10 of 12 tourna­
ments from 1956-1992, while the Czechs 
could do no better than silver. It also had 
a deeper meaningfor some ofthe Czechs, 
as star Jaromir Jagr of the Pittsburgh 
Penguins wore number 68 as a reminder 
of the year the Russians crushed a revo­
lution in Prague.
The game was a battle, as expected.

Men’s team ends winning streak
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Riding high on their victory over Wash­
ington University, the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s basketball team returned to ac­
tion at Skibo Gym against the unde­
feated University of Chicago on Sunday, 
February 15. Despite the high hopes of 
the team Chicago was an unruly guest 
in the Tartan home, and they handed 
the team yet another loss.
The Chicago Bears entered the game 
undefeated in the UAA this yearand 
holding a prodigious 19-1 overall record 
for the season. It was only a few short 
weeks ago that Carnegie Mellon and
Chicago had met on the Bears’ home 
court. Carnegie Mellon started a three 
game losing streak that night, losing 
66-49. By most measurements, CMU 
deserved to lose that game. The team’s 
25 percent shooting and 15 turnovers 
were textbook examples of what not to 
do when playing away against the leader 
of your conference.
The second meeting of the season for 
these two teams went better for CMU. 
Unfortunately, this game was again 
marked by the Tartans’ play in the first 
half. Usually, when the team loses, the 
first half serves to bury them so far 
behind the other team that they can not 
come back in the second half. This time,
the half was important not because they 
fell behind, but because they failed to 
capitalize on the flat play of Chicago.
The Bears only hit 11 of their 31 shots 
in the first half, and shot an anemic 33 
percent from the free throw line. In the 
first meeting of these teams, Chicago 
was able to put up 40 points in the first 
half. This time, they only managed 28.
CMU’s chances of upsetting another 
division opponent would have been 
helped considerably had they taken ad­
vantage of the weakness of the Chicago 
first half. However, instead of grabbing 
an early lead, CMU fell behind after 
shooting 30 percent in the first half.

CMU women throttle winless Cougars
By NATHAN STEINWALD
Tartan Sports Co-Editor
Carnegie Mellon’s women’s bas­
ketball team won their first game 
in over a month on Sunday, Febru­
ary 15, ending a nine-game losing 
streak and sending the University 
of Chicago back home with its 
eighth loss of the season. A few 
short days later, the team won its 
second straight game for the first 
time in more than a month by beat­
ing Chatham in Skibo Gym.
CMU had almost beaten Chicago 
and ended their losing streak 
at the end of January. At that 
point the team had lost four 
straight games, but CMU only lost 
by three points to Chicago. Since 
then, opportunities to win have not 
been plentiful.
In the first half of the game last 
week, CMU fell behind by two 
points. In the second half CMU 
edged ahead of Chicago for a nar­
row 42-41 victory.
The low score was largely a re­
sult of bad shooting. In addition, 
both Carnegie Mellon and Chicago 
had twice as many turnovers as 
assists, and neither team reached 
double digits in the offensive re­
bound count. Fortunately, sopho­
more forward Kristina Thomas was 
able to pour in 17 points to lift the 
team to the win.
Last Thursday, the Tartans 
hosted the Chatham College Cou­
gars. Coming into the game, the Cou­
gars were 0-16 for this season. Com­
passion was not on the minds of the 
Carnegie Mellon team, and they used 
the game to clear away the taste of 
their own nine game losing streak.
The game opened up with senior 
forward Kathleen O’Leary collecting 
an offensive rebound and scoring to 
give the Tartans the first points of 
the game. Senior Marcelle Steele hit 
a three- point shot, and O’Leary scored 
again as CMU opened the game with 
a 7-0 run before Chatham could cash 
in for two points.
On the next CMU possession, sopho­
more guard Lacey Perretta drove to 
the basket, encountering little resis- 
' tance from the Chatham defenders, 
and easily scored on a lay-up. 
Chatham called a time-out at this 
point with the hope of regrouping.
Coming out of the time-out, both 
teams sputtered, turning the ball over 
on a few ill-fated offensive posses­
sions, until Thomas hit the Tartans’ 
second three-point shot of the game 
to extend the CMU margin of victory.
By the time there was 14:30 re­
maining in the half, CMU was win­
ning 18-2. Against Chicago, the Tar­
tans had only scored 20 points in the 
entire first half. Carnegie Mellon sub­
stituted its entire starting line-up at 
this point and brought in the bench.
The substitutes easily dominated 
the Chatham Cougars and didn’t al-Hillary Carey/Tartan Photo Staff

Discovering Pittsburgh
Students learn outside campus setting
Groups explore local 
learning opportunities
By KEVIN BABBITT
Tartan Features Editor
When he decided to come to CMU, 
David Newell had no idea he would be 
doing construction work at some point. 
Furthermore, he never expected bhat it 
could actually be fun. But, on a Habitat 
for Humanity trip organized by Circle 
K, the junior art major discovered just 
how much fun — and learning — one 
could experience off-campus.
Likewise, Zak Thomas, a senior indus­
trial management major, has 
found, through theEastEndtutoringpro- 
gram, that helping elementary through 
highschool students with their homework 
offers the opportunity to not only provide 
a service to the community but also have 
a good time working with fellow CMU 
students as well as young people.
Thomas, in particular, remembers a 
trip in which East End tutors took stu­
dents at Reizenstein Middle School to 
the Carnegie Science Center to see a 
movie in the Omnimax theater and to 
explore the museum.
“It was a good opportunity for us to talk 
to [the students] and answer their ques­
tions about college and about our lives,” 
he said. “For the first time, we could be in 
a social situation and not have to direct
[the kids] back on task when they lost 
track of what they were doing.”
In addition to providing the chance to 
be a role model for the children, the trips 
give tutors the chance to preview what 
it’s like to interact with faculty in a 
different capacity. “Whenyou go to school 
as a student, you only see one side of 
teachers and administrators,” said Tho­
mas. “When you go as a tutor, you see 
how things need to work for the school to 
function.... It educates us for what we 
can expect someday ... as a parent.” 
The Friday after-school programs spon­
sored by East End offer participants a 
completely different learning experience. 
The programs consist of computer, ka­
rate, African dance, and sign language 
classes; CMU students learn the mate­
rial themselves and then pass this knowl­
edge on to program participants. Typi­
cally, one person who is well-versed in 
the subject will run the program.
In addition to tutoring, more tradi­
tional forms of community service also 
give students the chance to have a good 
time, bond with the community, and es­
cape from the rigors of campus life, ac­
cording to Newell. Circle K does service 
projects on a weekly basis in conjunction 
with local agencies including Ronald

Walking tours reveal city's quirky details
By ANNE RAY
Tartan Diversions Editor
Many days, Carnegie Mellon 
students walk the same route to 
class. They may come from nearby 
neighborhoods, or different parts 
of campus — up Devonshire, down 
Beeler, or across Forbes. Even 
though there may not be too many 
more exciting routes to DH2210, 
there is an expanse of sights in 
Pittsburgh that many don’t get to 
see very often. It seems as if we 
walk so much, but only in the 
same old places.
Caliguiri history professor Joel 
Tan*, who lives less than a half 
mile away and walks to his Baker 
Hall office, has a similar plight. 
In his classes, he makes the effort 
to show his students how much 
they can learn of Pittsburgh’s 
character just by walking. He 
takes his classes on walks through 
the city as a part of the learning 
experience. Much of his knowl­
edge of the city is self-learned 
through his own expeditions.
“[By walking, students] can see 
sides of life that they don’t see,” said 
Tarr. “I think a majority of the 
students on campus don’t get out 
into the city. Very few people know
about Frick Park, Clayton Park, 
the Pittsburgh Aviary, the Carnegie 
Science Museum, or the Mattress 
Factory, for example. There are a 
wealth ofthings [inPittsburgh]that 
are really of interest.”
Tarr teaches classes on the top­
ics of enviornmental and urban 
history, in which he uses the city 
itself as a way to understand 
many of the pertinent issues, as 
well as to expand students’ knowl­
edge of Pittsburgh.
“If I walk in other parts of the 
city, for instance, I like to walk on 
Carson Street in the South Side, 
where buildings have the dates on 
them,” said Tarr. “Or 
Washington’s Landing, where I 
like to bike or walk along the liver, 
see what’s going on, see the im­
provements that are being made.” 
On Washington’s Landing, an 
area of Pittsburgh with a unique 
infrastructure, expensive 
townhouses with private boat slips 
and driveways are being con­
structed right along the river, in 
addition to several public commu­
nity facilities. Standing at the end 
of the island, the view extends all 
the way to the central business 
district downtown, with Pittsburgh 
Plate Glass Place jutting upward
into the skyline. The three rivers of 
Pittsburgh are an integral part of 
the city’s transportation, Tarr said. 
Once, before constuction began on 
Washington’s Landing, he took 
classes for rides on the river’s 
pushboats, which gave first-hand 
experience of the actual workings 
of the river system.
Tarr said that Pittsburgh has 
many nuances that distinguish it 
from other cities. For example, af­
ter being in Prague this past sum­
mer and returning to Pittsburgh, 
the impressive architecture of lo­
cal churches and cathedrals stands 
out for him. In Pittsburgh’s down-
town area, churches designed in 
past centuries stand next to the 
most modern skyscrapers.
“When you’re in a car, you just 
don’t notice the small things that 
go by so quickly,” said Tarr. 
“These things just add to the rich­
ness of the experience.”
Walking in Pittsburgh adds a 
variety of experience not attain­
able by simply reading and at­
tending a lecture. Understand­
ing the structure of the city 
through exploring on foot creates 
another dimension to learning — 
and maybe another step toward 
feeling at home in Pittsburgh.

Field trips were something we did in 
grade school — visits to the zoo or the 
planetarium gave us a break from read­
ing, writing and the general humdrum 
of the normal school day. But for stu­
dents in an environmental sculpture 
course offered through the CMU art de­
partment, every class is a field trip to an 
historical environmental site located 
near Pittsburgh.
Each week, associate art professor Bob 
Bingham takes his students to the Nine 
Mile Run Greenway, an historic stream 
valley that has been used as a dumping 
ground for industrial slag from Pitts­
burgh area steel mills for over 50 years. 
The Nine Mile Run is the site of an 
ongoing study conducted through the 
STUDIO for Creative Inquiry for which 
Bingham (a co-director of the project) 
and other art department faculty work 
with city planners to transform the land 
into a space for private housing and 
public park areas.
Bingham combines his course with 
efforts to educate students and the com­
munity about “eco issues” of the 
greenway. “People call it a dump, but 
really it was a beautiful river valley,” he 
said. “I’ve been bringing students in to 
experience the site and hopefully as art­
ists they perceive it differently than the
people who live here.”
Students in the class brainstorm 
strategies to help the immediate com­
munity understand the history of the 
230-acre site. The Nine Mile Run wa­
tershed is a natural drainage basin for 
the Monongahela River. Bingham’s stu­
dents tour the site, take photos, 
make sketches, and collect natu­
ral and industrial artifacts dur­
ing their visits.
The goal of the class isn’t to 
make a product, said Bingham, 
but to go through the process of 
proposing ideas. For example, one 
project proposes using natural 
signage as opposed to bringing in 
new materials to make sign sys­
tems. “We react to everything we 
come upon,” said Bingham. “Par­
tially, what we’re dealing with as 
artists is the world — to develop 
it, change it.”
Courses like Bingham’s that 
stress experiential learning are 
important to CMU students who 
are typically isolated from the Pitts- 
burgh community, said- Dave 
Demarest, professor of English. 
“Teaching’in a general way is an 
inefficient business. You’re trying 
to convince people that it’s good to 
take this view or that view of a 
particular phenomenon,” he said.
In his course Reading the Built
Landscape, Demarest uses local communi­
ties to teach students how constructedland- 
scapes create ideologies in the communi­
ties that house them. He and his students 
take walks through different neighbor­
hoods, such as Braddock, to observe how

Growing up, Morry Belkin always 
dreamed of playing baseball someday 
for the Pittsburgh Pirates. Though this 
dream has left him, he has still had 
the chance to work with his favorite 
team. Officially, the senior electrical 
and computer engineering major de­
signs and maintains their Web site, but 
he has also held a variety of positions 
with the organization, including one in 
the marketing department and one as 
a stand-in usher during an ushers’ 
strike last September. He has even had 
the chance to interact with the players. 
The Tartan caught up with him re­
cently to find out how this manifesta­
tion of his childhood dream has af­
fected him.
The Tartan: How and why did you 
start working for the Pirates?
Morry Belkin: I’ve been a Pirates fan 
all my life; I’ve always wanted to do 
something for them.
When I was little, I wanted to be a 
baseball player, but that never panned 
out. A few years ago, I learned how to do 
Web stuff, and in September 1996, I 
called them up and asked them if they 
needed anyone to do their Web site. I 
offered to do it for free, and they said, 
“Sure, come on down.”
TT: Do you still do it for free?
MB: Yes; I get course credit for it, but 
basically it’s for free. I spend around 20 
hours a week on it. It’s fun; I’d rather do 
it for coursework, even though I don’t 
get anything out of it but tickets. People 
all over the world hit the Web site, and 
you get the feeling of, “Hey, I did that!”
The players check the pages some­
times, too. I sat down with one of the 
players and taught him how to use the 
Web; he was very into it and wanted to 
learn how to do it himself.
TT: What other interactions have you 
had with the players?
MB: I’ve talked to a couple of them on 
a few occasions, but I’ve never really had 
anything to say to them. Usually it will 
just be, “Hey, how’s it going?” as I see 
them; I don’t know too much about their 
personal lives, and I’m just another em­
ployee, really. If they ever get hurt, I’ll 
ask them how their injury is, but other 
than that, .it’s mostly small talk.
TT: Have you ever been on the field?
MB: Yes, a couple of times. Once I 
caught the ceremonial first pitch of a 
game, which was thrown by Tom Ander­
son, the CEO of Three Points Consult­
ing, where I also work.
TT: Do you still dream of playing 
baseball sometimes?
MB: Not really. I play softball on a 
team at Three Points, but there’s no 
chance ofplayingfor the Pirates — some 
of the players on the team now are 
younger than I am.
TT: At one point, you looked 
up to the players as role mod­
els; now they’re barely older, or 
even younger, than you are.
How does it feel to be asking 
them for autographs?
MB: That’s one of the weirdest 
things about the job. Once I got 
one of the minor-leaguers’ auto­
graphs, and he was a year 
younger than me. It’s the strang­
est feeling — I’d never asked for 
an autograph from someone 
younger than I am.
TT: What was the most un­
usual experience you’ve had on 
the job?
MB: Filling in as an usher.
When the ushers went on strike, 
everyone from the highest to the 
lowest level was an usher — you 
would see Steve Greenberg, the 
vice-president of Marketing, 
wiping off seats in the stands.
I also caught a foul ball for the 
first time in my life when I was 
an usher. I gave it to a three- 
year-old girl sitting in the stands, 
which made her happy.
TT: Who’s your favorite player for the 
Pirates, and why?
MB: Jose Guillen, the right fielder. I 
got to see him play when he was single- 
A [minor league], and he’s been a great 
player since then. I think he’ll be the 
next Roberto Clemente.
Lisette Miller-Dixon/Tartan Darkroom Manager 
Long-time Pirates fan Morry Belkin supports his 
team in his own way: by designing their Web site.
TT: How do you think the Pirates will 
do this year?
MB: I think the Pirates have a goi 
chance of winning the division title this 
year. They’re in a weak division and have 
a lot of young players who are really close 
to each other. Within the next three years, 
they’ll have a World Series ring.

Amnesty International drums up support for peace
By ANAND MARATHE
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, drums 
across the nation all beat in 
unison for a common cause: 
freedom, justice, and an end 
to repression in Nigeria.
That day, Amnesty Inter­
national sponsored an event 
called the “National Day of 
Student Action.” At CMU, 
the activities took place in 
Kirr Commons and the 
Connan room in the Univer­
sity Center. The activities 
included drum making fol­
lowed by a drum circle, a 
speech about Nigeria, and a 
movie by Owens Wiwa, a 
political refugee from Nige­
ria living in the U.S. The movie was 
titled Delta Force, and it documented 
the environmental pollution and exploi­
tation taking place in Nigeria.

campaign for justice in Nigeria in De

their dissatisfaction. 
“People should be more 
concerned about things 
that are going on in the 
world,” she said.
Tarr indicated that Am­

that concerned students

She suggested that students who could

the problem discussed on Thursday 
was more specific: the impact of recent 
political and social unrest on the 
nation’s economy.
One of the major foreign interests in 
Nigeria is the oil available in its land. 
Due to the recent unrest, however, pro­
event, Shell Oil has taken a very aggres­

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 23 February 1998L3
By REENA SINGHAL
Tartan Staffwriter
Unity. Leadership. 
Knowledge. Service.
These are the goals of 
Brother to Brother, a re­
cently formed campus or­
ganization created to fo­
cus on issues concerning 
African American men.
“We saw dwindling 
numbers of African 
American men being 
leaders on campus, so we 
decided to focus on the 
issue and fix the prob­
lem,” said Link Brown, a 
junior chemical engineer­
ing major and co-founder 
of the organization.
Last semester, Brown 
teamed up with Wole 
Oyenuga, a junior me­
chanical engineering ma­
jor, and their advisor,
George Stroud, who works 
with the Carnegie Mellon Action 
Project, to form Brother to 
Brother. The organization is striv­
ing to build unity among and 
present leadership opportunities 
for African American men, in­
crease knowledge in the African 
American community, and pro­
vide service to the community.
Every other week, the group 
holds open forums to discuss is­
sues that are either suggested by 
the attendees or are previously 
planned. “Through the open fo­
rums, we learn something from

Link Brown (left) and Wole Oyenuga (right) founded 
Brotherto Brotherto promote leadership opportunities.
each other, plus we get to voice 
our own opinions on certain is­
sues,” said Oyenuga.
Topics for the discussions have 
included affirmative action, rela­
tionships . between men and 
women, the “color complex,” and 
the decrease in black male lead­
ers in the community. “We also 
decided to take a closer look at 
[histiDrically black colleges and 
universities] since [they are] a 
growing issue,” said Brown. Ac­
cording to Brown, students often 
wonder whether they should have
gone to such a school, 
so they had a discus­
sion profiling these 
colleges and univer­
sities to educate 
people on what these 
schools are like.
Providing service to 
the community has 
been a large focus for 
the organization. Ac­
cording to Oyenuga, 
the organization saw 
early on that in a lot 
of community pro­
grams, there were 
few African American 
men acting as role 
models for younger 
children. Since then, 
the organization has 
teamed up with 
Pittsburgh’s chapter 
of 100 Black Men, a 
national organiza­
tion, to tutor local 
high school students 
in various subjects. Also, as a 
part of Black History Month, the 
group will be holding a workshop 
this Friday with the Carnegie 
Mellon Role Models program to 
teach younger children about Af­
rican American history through 
games and activities.
According to Oyenuga, forming 
the organization has created a 
constant pool of African Ameri­
can males who will continue act­
ing as role models in the commu­
nity. “[We are hoping] to create 
more male leaders so that when

we leave here, we have the spirit 
of giving back and not trying to go

Besides the workshop with the 
Role Models program, Brother to 
Brother organized a display in 
the University Center display 
cases, located outside of 
McConomy Auditorium, on black 
history, entitled “Portraits in 
Black History.” The display pro­
files prominent African Ameri­
can figures in history in the areas 
of the arts, sciences, community 
services, and politics.
According to Oyenuga, the or­
ganization stresses the impor­
tance of knowledge in the Afri­
can American community. “I 
hope that people realize that it is
not just African American his­
tory, it is a part of American 
history,” he said.
According to the co-founders, 
participation in the organiza­
tion through the discussions and 
various events has been very 
successful over the past several 
months. “We have seen in­
creased numbers of African 
American men getting involved 
in the community, but it is still 
not where we would like it [to 
be],” said Brown. However, he 
added that the organization has 
pulled a lot of people together 
on the campus, and several stu­
dents who are not normally ac­
tive in organizations such as 
Spirit or the National Society of
Black Engineers are coming out 
and doing something positive 
for the community.
For both Brown and Oyenuga, 
participation and organization of 
Brother to Brother has been a 
positive experience. “By the in­
crease of our membership in time, 
we hope to expand more and 
more,” said Oyenuga.
Brown said, “We just want to 
get out there and do as much as 
we can with the limited amount 
of time that we have.”
Brother to Brother meets every 
other Thursday at 7 pm. If you are 
interested in joining and would 
like more information about the 
group, please email Link Brown 
at lbrown@andrew.cmu.edu.

Art exhibit promotes Jewish cultural heritage
By GREGORY NOFI
Tartan Staffwriter
A gun and a pair of dirty boots lie 
beneath a bright, flowered shirt in the 
'corner opposite the entrance to the UC 
.Art Gallery. The piece is called Sol- 
.diers and Tourists and is a representa­
tion of the beauty and conflict that 
occur in a country that is the center of 
three religions. The piece is also part 
of “Celebrating 50 Years of Israel,” the 
current exhibit in the UC honoring 
Jewish Awareness Month.
This is the second year that a Jewish 
art exhibit has been featured in the 
UC gallery. This year, the Jewish Art 
eXpo features pieces from five CMU 
students and two University of Pitts­
burgh students. The exhibit, which is 
on display for the rest of February, is 
not just commemorating Israel but 
Judaism in general.
“The show is more about promoting 
Jewish awareness than celebration of 
the 50 years of Israel,” said Deborah 
Houben, a sophomore art major and 
organizer of the exhibit. “The only re­
quirement [of] the artists was that the 
piece[s] had to be of Jewish content.”
The display is one of sev­
eral activities that have 
been planned by the Hillel 
Foundation to celebrate 
Jewish Awareness Month. 
Houben thought it would 
be a good idea to incorpo­
rate art into the annual 
celebration of Judaism.
“I think it’s important for 
people to look at [the art],” 
said Houben. “It’samedium 
that I feel is very provoca­
tive and interactive.”
Houben herself contrib­
uted to the exhibit with 
two tall sketches of 
arches in Jerusalem. She 
lived in Israel for a year 
and always enjoyed look­
ing at the stone arches 
down the street from her

Students study some of the drawings that are part of the 
exhibit “Celebrating 50 Years of Israel” in the UC Art Gallery.
home. She drew the arches from a 
mental image that she says she will 
have forever.
The recent passing of a loved one in­
spired junior biology major Deborah 
Keller to contribute to the exhibit in the 
form of a kaddish — a Jewish mourning 
prayer said for 11 months after a person
dies. In addition, Keller contributed a 
graphite and charcoal piece entitled 
Token of Peace.
Not all of the presentations are draw­
ings. David Serotkin, a sophomore art 
major, created two non-traditional 
pieces, one of which was Soldiers and 
Tourists. Serotkin’s other contribution
is a piece called Articles of an 
American Jew. In this work, 
Serotkin improvises on tradi­
tional Jewish artifacts and 
frames, modern-day clothing to 
serve as a prayer shawl, 
yarmulke, and undergarment.
“I spent a long time thinking 
about areas to work in drawing,” 
said Serotkin. “But when I was at 
home, I thought about how I was 
Jewish ... and what artifacts I 
had and didn’thave. That’s where 
I took the traditional Jewish 
clothing and replaced it.”
Jeff Rosenblum, a research as­
sociate in the civil and environ­
mental engineering department, 
used art to help find Jewish roots 
in another part of the world. In 
his black-and-white photo shoot 
called A Portrait of Present-Day 
Jews in Belarus and Lithuania, 
Rosenblum displays photographs that 
he took of Jewish people revitalizing 
their faith after being out of practice for 
a long time. He also included a brief 
story of each of the pictures based on 
the interviews he conducted in Belarus 
and Lithuania.
“The photography is really strong,” 
said Jennifer Gibson, a freshman in the 
Bachelor of Humanities and Arts pro­
gram. “[The photographs] are not really 
formal shots or just random snapshots 
... but they’re very natural, and that’s a 
good sign of portrait photography.”
The Jewish Art eXpo has attracted 
not only Jewish students but also many 
Jews living in the local community. 
Houben publicized the event in sev­
eral Squirrel Hill synagogues and at­
tracted many Jews to the opening and 
reception last Tuesday.
Overall, the exhibit has elicited 
strong emotions from many of the 
people who have viewed it. Neil Stiber, 
a doctoral student in engineering and 
public policy, was one such student 
who expressed his reaction in the com­
ment book in the gallery.
“I think that [the exhibit] has captured 
the real Jerusalem feeling. Much of the 
work rings true about the current state of 
Jews, Judaism, and Israel,” he said.
The UC Art Gallery is located on the 
first floor to the left of the information 
desk and is open on weekdays from 
noon to 5 pm. The Jewish Art eXpo 
runs until February 26.

When was the last time you played in the mud? 
Seriously. If you haven’t done it in a while, I 
strongly recommend it. Yes, it’ll be dirty. Yes, it’ll be 
cold. But it’s good for the soul. Like suspenders. And 
speaking in really bad foreign accents. I think James 
Bond played in the mud every once in a while, and I bet 
that he didn’t look one bit less suave afterwards.

Volume 92, Issue 18The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania23 February 1998
Actor gets taste of fame
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Contributing Editor
Marlon Wayans is 25 years old, 
starring in his second movie, and, 
if he can be believed in his latest 
movie, Senseless, he knows his 
shit. Marlon is the last of ten 
Wayans children, including five 
working on TV and in movies. 
With the starring role in a new 
hit, released last Friday, the 
youngest Wayans has arrived. He 
plays Darryl Witherspoon, an 
economics student whose con-
* stant job-hunting leads him to 
take an experimental, senses-al- 
tering drug. Darryl uses the won- 
der-drug to wow job recruiters, 
but his senses begin to fail when 
he takes an overdose. From a 
lower rung role as a pedestrian in
.his debut I’m Gonna Git You 
‘ Siicka in 1988, Wayans has 
climbed the ladder of success. 
These days, projects come to him.
“When I heard it, I was like,
. ‘Yo, I could do wonders with this,’ 
' ” Wayans said about when the 
Senseless script was pitched to 
, him. “After that I just signed on 
; todo it; we took it to [co-producer] 
David Hoberman. We just took it 
over to Miramax and voila.” 
According to Wayans, the char­
acter of Darryl was ideal for him.
“[I like] roles like this where I 
. can have a character get into a 
crkzy situation and just play out 
the scenes.”
' “The writers wrote a lot of great
• material that was a great spring­
board for me to dive off,” said 
Wayans. When the lead charac-
, ter has a negative response to the 
sense-altering drug, the script 
reads: “[Darryl’s] butt itches.” 
Instead ofjust scratching his butt, 
Wayans launches into a diatribe 
against rectal sensitivity and 
grabs a pair of bristly brushes to 
quell the sensation.
The role featured familiar ma­
terial for Wayans, but he also vis­
ited new places to research his 
part. “[The] economics stuff, I grew 
up with that. I was broke at birth,” 
said Wayans. “I worked in a pizza 
shop. I got paid $25 every two 
weeks. But I ate all this free pizza.
So l was broke, bloated, and con­
stipated.... For the senses, I actu­
ally went to a Braille Institute.... I 
, actually went to a sperm bank.”
Wayans is one of the latest from 
a long line of bankable comedi­
ans to jump to Hollywood from 
sketch comedies such as Satur­
day Night Live, Second City, and 
In Living Color. But while mov­
ies such as Wayne’s World, 
Tommy Boy, and Ace Ventura are 
often just extensions of the sketch 
characters, Wayans tries to find 
projects with more drama.
“The commitment is different,” 
said Wayans about the difference 
between sketch and movie com­
edy. “The story is personal; you 
can’t do inappropriate jokes. If 
[the character] is talking kinda 
funny, there’s a reason. In a 
sketch, you just want to be funny.” 
“I have a comedian’s mind and a 
comedian’s heart, but I have the 
skills of an actor — I’ve been trained 
as an actor,” said Wayans, who 
attended New York’s High School 
for the Performing Arts. “I don’t 
always want to be ‘silly guy.’ ” 
While Senseless and The Sixth 
Man emphasize story elements 
as much as the comedy, Wayans’
Wayans Brothers. Wayans co­
wrote and co-produced Don’t be a 
Menace with Shawn in 1996 and 
has worked with brother Damon 
{Mo’ Money, 1992) and multiple 
family members through his 
brother Keenan’s productions.
“We’re contemporaries,” 
Wayans said about working 
mostly with Shawn. “But I like 
working with all my family. I’ll 
work with Grandma.... It’s 
friendly competition. That’s my 
family; if one of us makes it, we 
all make it.”
The success of the Wayans fam­
ily has led some to call them the 
Jacksons of comedy. When asked if 
his family emulated the Jackson 
musical legacy, Wayans replied, 
“Maybe before the nose jobs. Actu­
ally we always kinda patterned 
ourselves after the Jacksons.” 
While comparisons have been 
drawn between the Wayans fam­
ily and other successful enter­
tainment clans, Wayans discour­
ages those who herald him as the 
next great comedian or the black
1998 Dimension Rims 
Marlon Wayans enjoys recent fame with the film Senseless.
next project looks to be pure fun.
“We have a movie called the 
Fairy Godbrothers. It’s about two 
brothers who get trapped in fairy 
tale land, and they mess up all 
these fairy tales and gotta go back 
and fix them.”
Wayans will star with his 
brother Shawn, who’s also his co- 
star on their hit TV show The
Jerry Lewis. Although Wayans’ 
career is still young, he is also 
wise to the way Hollywood re­
wards its true stars.
“I think I’m the black Marlon 
Wayans,” he said. “You can call 
me the black Jim Carrey and all 
that, but until I get that green 
money [it doesn’t mean anything]. 
Black, white, it’s all about green.”
Film revisits past era to 
frame romantic comedy
By EMILY LANDES
Tartan Staffwriter
With the close of the 1990s just 
around the corner, a very strange 
thing has happened. It is now pos­
sible to be nostalgic about that long 
forgotten era — the ’80s. The most 
recent incarnation of this ’80s nos­
talgia is Frank Coraci’s film, The 
Wedding Singer, starring Adam 
Sandler and Drew Barrymore. This 
decade was a quieter, gentler time 
when MTV actually played videos, 
the biggest controversy was “Who 
Shot J.R.?” and Bill Gates was just 
another dorky computer guy who 
couldn’t get laid. Now, one might 
think it’s absurd to feel sentimental 
about an era only just slightly in our 
past, but admit it, if I mentioned 
Transformers and My Little Pony 
right now, almost anyone would get 
a little misty.
© 1998 New Line Cinema 
Adam Sandler stars as Robbie Hart in The Wedding Singer.
Sandler plays Robbie Hart, the wedding singer 
in question. Hart is the best in his business, that 
is, until.he gets stood up at his own wedding. 
Suddenly everywhere that he used to see love 
and happiness, he now sees bitterness and de­
spair, which makes playing at weddings an ex­
tremely unpleasant task. His friend Julia 
(Barrymore) tries to cheer him up by making him 
a part of her impending wedding. But her fiance, 
Glenn (Matthew Glave) is a jerk, and as her 
wedding date approaches, Hart and Julia find 
themselves, surprise, falling in love.
What: The Wedding Singer 
Director: Frank Coraci 
Company: New Line
Of course, this timeless story takes place in 
1985. Therefore the movie is sprinkled with big 
hair, red leather jackets, acid-washed jeans, and 
various other ’80s fashion statements. There are 
also plenty of references to fads like New Coke 
and Rubik’s cubes. And a lot of humor is derived 
from the “How naive we were then” factor — 
naive to think that Burt and Loni would be 
together forever, that Billy Idol, who makes a 
cameo appearance as himself, would always be 
on top of the charts, and that magenta and 
aquamarine were actually a good color combina­
tion. And then, there are the songs. Featuring 
classic ’80s hits like “99 Red Balloons” and “Love 
Stinks,” the movie almost seems like a vehicle to 
market the soundtrack.
But, to say that nostalgia is all there is to The 
Wedding Singer would be incorrect. If this were 
true, I don’t think I would have enjoyed this
movie nearly as much as I did. It’s the one-of-a- 
kind characters that make this movie more 
than just a marketing ploy tied up in a cliché 
romantic comedy.
Sandler winningly reprises the “aw-shucks” 
persona that brought him fame on Saturday 
Night Live, and Barrymore is as cute and che­
rubic as always. But it’s actually the support­
ing actors that put this film over the top. 
Christine Taylor (The Brady Bunch Movie) is 
great as Julia’s Madonna-obsessed cousin 
Holly, although the innocence that worked so 
well when she played Marcia Brady seems out 
of character here. Alexis Arquette is hysterical 
as band member George, a Boy George look- 
alike whose main job in the band seems to be to 
sing, “Do You Really Want to Hurt Me?” again 
and again. But by far the best performance was 
by octogenarian Ellen Albertini Dow as Robbie’s 
voice student, Rosie. Humor is produced sim­
ply by having this little old woman tell Robbie 
that she has “had sex with eight men before 
[she] was married. That’s like 200 today,” must 
be seen to be believed.
Evidence of how important these characters 
are to the movie is clear in the audience’s reac­
tion. All the movie-goers I saw left the theater 
looking happy, even though a surprisingly high 
percentage of them were not alive in 1985 (scary, 
I know). If The Wedding Singer was just a formu­
laic plot line and a catchy soundtrack, I probably 
would have heard a lot more comments like that 
of one young moviegoer: <fYeah, that was OK, but, 
who was that old English guy with the leather 
jacket and blond spikey hair?”
Period production lacks narrative
By HEATHER J. DENYER
Tartan Staffwriter
Many plays nowadays forget about 
their historical context, leaving the 
audience with a story ungrounded in 
any particular period; CMU’s pro­
duction of Steve Gooch’s Female 
Transport, on the contrary, presents 
ah intriguing historical context, but 
unfortunately, nothing more. Female 
. Transport is a view of female prison- 
' ers shipped from England to Austra­
lia in the 1800s. Unfortunately, the 
playwright neglects a plot develop­
ment from the background to move 
his play along.
In this production, performed in the 
Kresge Theatre, the rough setting and 
the characters’ crassness provide a true 
representation of the history of the 
period. Yet, even the insightful acting 
and characterizations can not make up
- for the failure on the playwright’s part 
; to convey a narrative in his play. All of 
the actors execute these challenging 
characters well. They master the dia­
lect as well as the tough exterior the 
convicts need to protect themselves. 
Since there is no specific principal charac­
ter to follow along with a plot line, all the 
,* audience can recognize is the ensemble
* performing dialogue in a setting, bringing 
the history to life. From a historical point 
of view, this play adds insight to astartling 
situation. But, as far as entertainment, 
there is none.
From a production perspective, this 
play is well-executed. Costume designer 
Leigh Henderson, as well as dialect su­
pervisors Don Wadsworth and Natalie 
Baker establish true to life characters, 
and the actors and actresses fulfill their 
duty with convincing performances.
The set and lighting create an effective
courtesy College of Fine Arts 
Steve Gooch’s Female Transport is the story of female prisoners in the 1800s.
atmosphere for the piece. The whole stage 
looks like a ship, rounded on the bottom 
with sails forming the background. The 
heavy, low beams of the ship extend out 
above the seating, drawing the audience 
further into the confines of a ship. Director 
Ingrid Sonnichsen brings the challenging 
framework of the 19 th century to life while 
blocking effective movement in the con­
fines of the ship setting. One can almost 
smell the foulness of the air and feel the 
cramped prison of the small ship galley.
There are a few moments when the 
tension peaks, but these short-lived 
stabs at story lines end i drown in the 
continual despair of these women, iso­
lated on a boat, both physically and 
from true dramatic developments.
Sitting through the performance is 
much like experiencing the six month 
boat ride. While Female Transport pro­
vides a very unusual background, 
which the director executes as effec­
tively as possible, there is no story. I 
wouldn’t say those who left early 
missed anything they wouldn’t have 
taken away from the first few mo­
ments of the show. While the audience 
feels a new pity and understanding for 
the women, the play lacks a basic 
narrative stucture to guide the audi­
ence along.
Off-campus journeys teach urban lessons

these ideologies affect Pittsburgh.
“Part of education ought to be interac­
tion with the local community,” said 
Demarest. “I’m sort of a localist, so I 
believe that the best way to learn is by 
looking at the environment around you.” 
Last Saturday his class walked around 
Braddock starting with a tour of the 
Braddock Carnegie Library, then through 
the mill streets and alleys of Braddock’s 
First Ward.
A third of the material he presents in 
his classes uses the context of Pittsburgh. 
“I really think that historically there 
hasn’t been interaction between CMU 
and the black community ... and that’s a 
result of defining education in an elitist 
way,” said Demarest.
Demarest has taken his students to a 
range of “built landscapes” from inner 
city neighborhoods in the Northside, 
Homestead, and the county jail, to the 
other side of the coin, which includes 
gated communities like Washington’s 
Landing and Shadyside Village. “I try to 
develop walks that show where the old 
and new are butting each other, to show 
what kinds of people are designated to 
live in these places,” he said.
Taking students out of their boxes so 
they can think outside of the university 
setting is a primary focus for professors 
like Bingham and Demarest who believe 
students must contextualize their ideas 
in their immediate surroundings. “They’re 
going to have to find jobs and those jobs 
will involve other people. Artists are cre­
ative problem solvers. I’m teaching art 
students to become more involved in real 
world problems,” said Bingham.
In addition to Nine Mile Run site 
visits, students in the environmental 
sculpture class also research other en­
vironmental artists and issues. “But 
the world has moved into specializa­
tion. We’re becoming more pluralistic 
and it’s healthy, it’s breaking down bar­
riers,” said Bingham. “There’s a 20- 
year history of artists working like this, 
and it brings people together. Sounds 
idealistic, I know.”
Students also benefit from classes 
that leave the classroom once in awhile 
because the proof is in the doing, says 
Joe Ballay, professor in the School of 
Design. “I really believe in what you 
call experiential learning because in 
one way, practically all we do in design 
is experiential,” said Ballay. “At it’s 
foundation design learning and doing is 
very tangible; there’s little theory.” 
Ballay teaches a junior industrial de­
sign class, How Things Are Made, which 
takes students through the entire pro­
cess of product production beyond the 
designer’s studio. Balla/s students visit 
factories and other production sites 
throughout the semester to talk to see 
how an idea is carried out from begin­
ning to end.
“This kind of class helps bring a de­
signer out of the so-called “designing 
with a blindfold” scenario and into a 
more real life context,” said Michael 
Mckeown, a junior industrial design 
major who took Ballay’s class. “Design­
ers can sometime take for granted the 
products we use.”
Ballay said “You .can theorize, talk 
about it, but you don’t know until you 
experience it — you haven’t learned.”

Local band draws from ska roots
By ERICA VOGLE
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
! The members of the local band Disturbed 
Youth may not look like Johnny Rotten, 
but their sound is as authentically punk as 
a safety pin through the nose. Disturbed 
Youth consists of Mark Solomich on drums,
Josh Tanzer on guitar, Steve Kijanka on 
bass, Andrew Grossman on guitar, and 
Greg Solomich on vocals. The band just 
released their third album, The Healing of 
a Nation, which was recorded on Minda 
Berbecois’s radio show at WRCT.
Who: Disturbed Youth 
LgM What: The Healing of a Nation 
Company: Track #5
Healing of a Nation is exciting and ready 
to explode like a post-pubescent boy on 
prom night. Disturbed Youth sounds a lot 
like Minor Threat, but with a fresh twist 
that comes from its teenage energy — the 
average age of the band members is 16.
They are all talented musicians, though, 
and this is apparent in the quality of each 
song and the album as a whole.
Groups expand horizons
Most of the songs on The Healing of a Nation, 
such as “White Trash” and “College Bound,” are 
a reflection of the band members’ immediate 
experience in Pittsburgh. “Thanks to all the 
Alcohol” was inspired by Mark Solomich get­
ting beaten up at a party — an experience that 
is surprisingly common for him. Disturbed 
Youth broke up for a short time recently, after 
both Solomich brothers were in fights on two 
separate occasions, after two different shows, 
during the same weekend.
Luckily for the Pittsburgh music scene, the 
brothers weren’t seriously injured and have 
decided to keep playing. Greg Solomich and 
his band mates have also learned the valuable 
lesson of keeping their eyes off of the girlfriend 
of a 6’5” punk with something to prove. “The 
members of Disturbed Youth ... have a little 
President Clinton in all of them,” said Tanzer.
In addition to Disturbed Youth’s punk sound, 
they also have definite ska influences. This 
influence is especially prominent on “Brand 
New Crack Pipe,” which has a guitar riff remi­
niscent of The Clash. The fast-paced “Testing 
Ground” is one of my favorite songs, in which 
they protest nuclear testing and foreign policy. 
It is one of the few politically motivated tracks.
The album cannot rival the energy of their
live shows where Greg Solomich jumps around 
the stage. At the last show J" went to, Solomich 
was in an extremely excited state and was 
gyrating around like a drugged squirrel. One 
audience member got so into the fast paced and 
hard beats that he spat beer on Tanzer, report­
edly out of respect. Asked if Disturbed Youth 
had ever elicited a riot, the band members said 
they hadn’t, but that an ex-member once had 
an electric shock inflicted upon him while on 
stage. They didn’t know he was being shocked 
at first because they thought he was just af­
fected by the music.
The members of Disturbed Youth conceded 
that being a successful punk band in Pitts­
burgh has a lot to do with image. “If you want 
to be a punk band you need a mohawk and 
patches and stuff,” said Tanzer. This explains 
why, at the last punk show I attended, a kid in 
the audience kept shouting, “Pay attention to 
my hair!”
Disturbed Youth plays mostly house shows, 
but they opened for Anti-Flag last October 
at Laga. Their next show is scheduled for 
some time in March. The Healing of a Nation 
is available at independent record stores 
such as Brave New World and The 
Record Exchange.

“It’s a great chance to experi­
ence the city around us and to 
know the city in a deeper way 
than just driving around,” said 
Newell. “You get to talk to people 
and touch their lives.”
The most recent trip Newell 
went on was a visit to a Habitat 
for Humanity construction site. 
The organization buys and rents 
property to build houses for low- 
income families.
Other students, such as Mark 
Stover, a junior industrial man­
agement major, find fun and 
learning opportunities in trips 
more directly related to their 
field of expertise. Last Friday, 
Stover visited a Pittsburgh Plate 
Glass (PPG) plant in Creighton, 
Penn., with the Association for 
Industrial Management and Eco­
nomics (AIME). The trip included 
an overview of the company and 
a recruitment meeting to dis­
cuss job opportunities.
AIME rarely makes off-cam­
pus excursions, according to Sto­
ver, but the opportunity to 
visit PPG was a welcome one. 
“A lot of students- expressed 
interest in seeing a production 
facility in action,” he said. 
“You read about it in a text­
book, but never really get to see 
it. It was a chance to see real 
work being done instead of just 
studying it.”
For many of the visitors, it 
was their first time at such a 
facility, but it was a learning 
experience even for those such 
as Stover, who had toured other 
plants in the past. “I thought 
there would be a lot of people 
handling the glass and shaping 
it, but a lot of [the process] was 
automated.” he said.
What Thomas, Newell, and 
Stover all found, however, was 
that trips such as the ones 
they had each taken were op­
portunities to broaden their 
horizons and have a good time 
doing it.
“We always hear the words 
‘rewarding’ and ‘positive expe­
rience,’ ” said Newell. “When 
you succeed, you feel a lot 
of satisfaction.”

Reason skews play’s intentions
By SUSAN MURRAY
Tartan Staffwriter
Eugene Ionesco is a silly play­
wright. The production of his Kill­
ing Game last week picked up on 
this silliness, perhaps a little too 
much. Killing Game is the story of 
a town hit by a plague that causes 
people to drop dead by the thou­
sands. The Studio Theatre produc­
tion, directed by senior drama ma­
jor Jasmine G. Jaisinghani, opens 
with the entrance of a sinister fig­
ure in black wearing goofy white 
sneakers. This figure is responsible 
for the deaths. In the first scene, he 
summons the town on-stage for the 
first round of killing.
By making the agent of death 
visible, the terror Ionesco intended 
is reduced. Instead of watching an 
afternoon gone astray as people 
drop dead without reason, the au­
dience is comforted by the fact 
that this event was orchestrated 
by this silly death figure. Making 
the agent of death so prominent in 
the production brought the worst 
thing imaginable to Killing Game: 
an explanation. It was like watch­
ing an episode of The Twilight 
Zone where the ending had al­
ready been explained.
The play also illustrates the 
breakdown of order into chaos. 
The opening staging is flat. The 
actors move in beelines from left 
to right, while engaged in dia­
logue. The lighting is bright and 
sunny. As the play progresses,
1

props accumulate on stage. The 
piles of items are a strong meta­
phor for the piles of black and 
blue bodies of the plauge victums.
The play’s better moments are 
when death becomes real. In a 
scene towards the end of the 
play, an older couple makes their 
way through the empty streets 
of the town. As they talk about 
everyday topics, the death fig­
ure rearranges the items on 
stage. The audience finally en­
ters Ionesco’s absurd universe. 
After several dozen staged 
deaths, , the death of a elderly 
woman in her husband’s arms 
brings the importance of human 
life back into perspective. It is 
the only death in the course of 
the play which is truly believ­
able. This change in perspec­
tive is why the production was 
on a whole strong. Through 
Ionesco’s confusing yet humor­
ous world, Killing Game allowed 
the audience to discover and 
question the beautiful and ter­
rible nature of human life.: !\JTWn»n mE3anv

The Third Man
Orson Welles is so cool. Did you know he was the 
planet-eating evil force in Transformers: The Movie, 
the animated feature that graced the screens for a 
brief period in the spring of 1986? He died during 
production, presumably from eating too many plan­
ets — pathetic end to the man who started his film 
career with Citizen Kane. He sure was a fat bas­
tard. And you know what they do with unfunny fat 
bastards in film: They stick them in the shadows. 
They do it in this noirish flick, and they did it in 
Apocalypse Now with tubby, fly-swallowing Marlon 
Brando. How would you like to have been the A.D. 
responsible for airlifting Ding Dongs into deep 
Cambodia?

Brits kick ass. Especially these five naked ones. 
Now you might be thinking: Why would I want to : 
plop down my hard-earned dollar (or, more likely, I 
my easily-bummed-off-my-parents dollar) to see a: 
bunch of out-of-shape, blue-collar slobs take off. 
their redcoats? Well, because it’s funny, dammit. 
And it’s more than that. It’s a heartwarming tale 
about the reunification of a father with his son. No, 
I’m serious. Plus there’s smoking. Yup, cigarettes^ 
are still legal in Old Brittania. Not like here, where * 
they look at you funny if you douse a dachshund in^ 
kerosene and light it on fire. Man, I’m sick of being" 
oppressed. _

Jackie Chan could kick James Bond’s wimpy

treasure in the Sahara, just like in MacGyver’s'

wind tunnels, sand, large, impractical machinery,^ 
flagrant violations of strict laws of physics, more 
sand, and of course, J ackie’s special blend of action/,-' 
comedy stunt casserole. Come for the chives, stay-

National Engineers Week
You've probably seen a million messages saying how the 
efforts of engineers are vital to building a competitive and 
prosperous country. Basically, engineers are set up as dorks. 
The truth is that they aren't dorks. They just happen to be 
really big kids that get to play with really expensive toys. That 
guy with the Mr. Coffee hooked up to the network? He's the 
only exception. You might think that the one girl who spends 
all of her time in the cluster is a nerdy programmer, but she's 
really just sitting there writing long email and drinking Coke. 
It's time to celebrate a national week of engineering — break 
out the toys and look for free food!

YORK
CITY (4)
Welcome back reader! Were proud to bring you Dossiers first issue of the sem­
ester entitled New York. We thought it would be fitting to present pieces with 
all the pizzazz, grit, and style of a New Year’s celebration in New York City.
Choosing pieces that we felt contained the sometimes subtle pulse of New 
York was challenging. We received a lot of submissions, but what we ended 
up with is: the rumba, sex, toenails, feather boas, and death.
We wanted to have this issue work both literally and conceptually. Our two 
poems, A Question of Perception and Stranded, in the Land of P, tap most 
directly into urban images. The concrete, the music, the moves, all help to 
convey the sensuality of the city.
Conceptually, we felt that Sex and a Movie and The Accident fit right in with 
some of the emotional issues that are amiss within the Big Apple. Desperation, 
masks, and the anonymity of existence enrich the space between the lines of 
these stories. We read them with great pleasure and we hope you do too.
Additionally, we hope, that by including The Accident, we have opened up the 
way for writers to submit longer works of fiction or non-fiction.
On the design end of things, our staff emphasized a wide variety of urban 
qualities in their layouts. The fast-paced chaotic New York mindset, for 
instance, effectively takes visual form in the layered type on page four. Taking 
a completely different approach, the designer of the Sex and a Movie spread 
focused on the concept of urban decay and degradation, while also trying to 
echo the metaphor of distortion used at the end of the story.
Thinking more literally, other designers created “skylines” and “skyscrapers” 
on the page, using compositional elements (the vertical rectangle on page 
one) or the type itself (the spreads for The Accident).
Enjoy!

Are you the Philip of my future?”
“I; don’t know,” said Philip. He looked at his father, both feet now on the 
ground-but still supporting himself against the side of the bookshelf, in the atti­
tude of Christ in his mothers arms. Philip wanted to call to him, to make his 
voice loud and authentic, but it was as small as it had ever been.
His father continued, quieter now, as though speaking from the bottom of 
a barrel. “I don’t have a future. Not a past either. The joke’s on you, stranger. My 
son Philip, whom you resemble in name only, was my future. And I gave up all 
my past for that future. I worked every day in a factory for that boy — my 
hands have scarred from the work — though as a young man I would have been 
happy with my simple sculptures. But Philip demanded more of me, all of me, 
and now he has gone and done a foolish thing and died. And with him died my 
past and future.” His father let himself slide to the floor. “Now there is no past, 
no future,” he said. “There is only now. And now. And now.”
And with each “now” he brought his fist down on one of his sculptures, 
crushing it with a calloused hand. He went around the circle till every sculp­
ture was flattened, and then he lifted his bleeding hands to his son as though 
in prayer or beggary. Something in his face looked menacing, threatening. His 
emerald eyes shone with the blind search for vengeance. He backed Philip to
the door, his broken hands turning more and more into fists with each step.
But before he could reach him, Philip ran out the doorway, down the stairs, 
past the kitchen and out in front of the house. He stood at the gateway look­
ing up at the tower of his father’s study, panting because he was breathless, 
sweating because he was foolish and had chosen to wear clothes. He took them 
off again; they peeled off his skin like a wetsuit. He shivered in the approach­
ing evening and felt a pressure in his brain as though he had just been under­
water and had just now come up for air, drawing in the deep, long, unfiilfilling 
breath of an asthmatic.
He heard the door click and lock behind him.
“Ma?” he said, but there was no answer.
Then he saw through the strip of window along the staircase his mother’s 
bare feet pushing and rising, pushing and rising.
His mother disappeared into the attic, and Philip closed his eyes to listen 
over the noise of the unseen crickets and birds for the sound of his mother’s 
soothing voice. He became nothing but a pair of ears; he didn’t even feel or 
smell the cold anymore, didn’t see the insides of his eyes. But for a long time 
he heard nothing from the room, not even their sobbing.
Then, the sound of a throat clearing, of fingers shuffling through dry 
paper. And then a sound he’d never heard before: his father’s voice, strong and 
proud now, traveling down the chamber of the staircase and through the front 
windows as through the cones of a speaker. Philip was starded by the change 
in his father; he was a new man. The foreign voice roared, thundered, tumbled, 
then rose sharply and floated, somehow higher than the words it spoke. And 
his mother was so silent beneath this voice he could hear her listening, could 
hear her clothes rub together to make the warmth that had once held Philip in 
its envelope a sacred prisoner.
He wanted to feel that warmth now. He wanted to be there with them in 
this moment of discovery, his fathers voice finding and forming itself amid the 
wreckage of metal parts, cracking the silencing shell that had always muffled it. 
He wanted to be there when his mother was joyous again, her arms folded 
across her full belly, her eyes closed, seeing nothing but the colors of the words.
But Philip couldn’t see or feel any of these things. He stood senselessly 
anchored in his spot, having worn his welcome at last. His mother and father 
had found what they were looking for in the wake of his intrusion, and they 
would not let him in again, not if he scratched and screamed and clawed at 
their door like an animal.

---------------------------------------------------

hands nestled between the folds of that same fabric, and when he lifted the 
folds the factory smell of his father was beneath them. He stared down at his 
mother’s knee now, longing to sit in her lap.
“Mother,” he began, “It was an accident.”
But she interrupted him with an abrupt shout which no doubt echoed 
throughout the house and up into his fathers chamber. “How dare you show 
your face here," she said.
He put on his best frightened face, the face of a boy lost in the woods, but 
she ignored him. “What am I supposed to do with this birthday cake?”
Philip thought it looked like she already knew. He didn’t understand how 
his mother could do something so cold as eat his cake as she sat here mourn­
ing his death. It confused and frightened him. And why hadn’t she made an 
offer to hold him? Didn’t she feel any sympathy toward him?
And yet, he softened to think he knew how she felt. The dead were only 
important to the living. He was not supposed to feel pain. Perhaps she didn’t 
expect him to feel pain. And he knew she felt more pain over him than he had 
ever felt over himself.
He stood up suddenly, compelled by an overwhelming impulse to sit in her 
lap. He tried curling up and resting his head below her chin but she pushed him 
out before he could warm himself.
“Get off,” she said. “You’re too heavy.” He looked down at her. Her house­
coat had been ruffled in the awkward struggle.
Philip felt a pang in his stomach, urging him to speak. “I’ll make it up to 
you,” he said. “I didn’t mean to die — I lost faith. But I never wanted you to 
die in this house. No one has to die in this house; you’re both still alive.”
His mother gave him a long, knowing look, as though satisfied he was 
mature enough to understand what she was about to say. “Never again,” she
said. “Being a mother like me, in a house full of men, you give everything up. 
Your whole life is giving, and everyone else’s life is taking. Your life was taking, 
and you took my life with you into that jungle. I told you not to do that, but 
you wouldn’t listen, and now my heart’s devoured and can never beat again for 
anyone, not even you, not even your father.”
Philip heard a cry from upstairs, as though in answer to this devastating 
news. His mother looked indifferently down at the birthday cake, running her 
tongue along her upper lip.
“Dad,” yelled Philip. He ran to the back of the house and zigzagged up the 
stairs, but the door to his father’s study was locked. He pushed and pulled and 
knocked, but there was no answer, only the sound of heavy breathing on the 
other side. He knocked again. “Dad,” he called.
“He has to let you in,” his mother called from below. “Don’t break the door 
down.”
But Philip, fearful that his father might be in pain, did not listen to her and 
broke the door down. Inside his father lay prostrate across a low-lying book­
shelf, his miniature metal sculptures arranged around the base of the bookshelf 
like relics.
“An intruder,” his father hoarsely whispered. Philip saw that he had gone 
blind in his absence. He was dressed in a robe, barefoot. His skin looked 
unclean and pasty. And when he raised himself up on his elbow to try to retreat, 
his right leg and buttock slipped over the edge of the bookshelf. He started 
slipping to the ground, trying to hold himself and his falling robe up with his 
elbow, his blind head thrown back in exhaustion.
“Stay away from me,” he said, his eyes toward the ceiling. “Who are you?” 
“It’s Philip.”
“I don’t know a Philip. I know I had a son, Philip, but that was in the past.

into a sweat which seeped into the clothes he ¡was wearing, creating an odor 
about him that only scared more of the customers away. “Stop it,” he told him­
self, under his breath. “You want this job, yoij need this job.” But the sweat kept 
oozing out, like the truth spoiling a lie, though it was intolerably cold as always 
in the lobby. By mid-afternoon he began to pace, smearing his wet palms 
against the door handles. Customers hated him now; he invaded their space 
and bumped into a few of them. And at the end of the day the boss yanked 
Philip into his office.
"What’s the matter with you?” he asked.
The sweat beaded immediately on Philips forehead as though in answer. 
He wiped it off angrily and began to explain himself, but the boss interrupted 
him.
“Don’t try to fool me,” said the boss. Philip tried to avoid his small, sharp 
eyes and rested his gaze on his bosses’ desk- It was clean except for a few fold­
ed papers, the top halves of which were constandy being blown open by the air 
conditioning; to Philip they looked like half-open mouths.
Then, resting on a comer of the desk, Philip spotted that morning’s paper. 
He picked it up and saw that it was folded to the obituary column. A paragraph 
was circled heavily, angrily in pen. It read:
Philip House, devoured, age 26. He leaves behind a father and mother.
Funeral services Wednesday.
Next to the paragraph was a photograph of Philip from childhood, stand­
ing next to a diseased tree, a surprised and upset look on his face. It looked as 
though young Philip was just learning the news himself.
“Well?” his boss said.
“It was an accident,” Philip said.
“I don’t want to hear your childish excuses," said his boss. “Obviously I’m 
going to have to fire you.”
And as Philip could think of no explanation for his death, he silendy left 
the glassy building. He went out into the hot afternoon, removing his tie and 
coat, then his shirt, his socks, his pants, until he was naked in the black park­
ing lot. But still he could not keep from feeling suffocated. He would have to 
go see his mother and father now, and they knew already, had probably known 
before he did. What would he tell them? How could he account for his death, 
make them understand that he had not meant to hurt them?
Perhaps, if he had a voice worth hearing now, he could whisper dreams to 
them in their sleep. When they awakened they would be refreshed rather than 
exhausted and angry as usual. And in the daytimes he could go through his 
father’s bookcase and read to his family from a book of prayers in a booming 
voice. His father had never been able to read the prayers, properly. His eyes and 
ears had stumbled over the words while his family sat with palms pressed 
together, heads lowered, and ears straining to listen. Philip had inherited this 
voice; it stretched out in front of him, flat and thin as a desert plain. He had 
always been afraid of making any noise too loud for the house to handle. But 
in death Philip would prove unafraid. His voice would resonate throughout the 
house, cracking its quiet foundations. His mother and father would be capti­
vated by the sway and crush of his voice, by a grace they’d never before encoun­
tered.
He got in his car, started it, then realized he could not visit his parents 
without clothes, it might be too much of a shock for them on top of everything 
else. So he went out and gathered all his clothes again and dressed himself. This 
time he was careful to emphasize his humility in his dress; whereas before he 
had tied his tie in a tight, confident knot, made to instill confidence in cus­
tomers, now he tied it loose around his neck, accentuating his disheveled, 
lonely state. He looked in his rear view mirror and mussed his hair to remind
his mother that he was in no condition to comb it. She would be sympathetic 
to him then; she had a big heart and could not stand to see anyone in distress. 
She would grab him and crush him as though he was a child again and he 
would like to feel that crush now. As for his father, he would see in his boy’s 
appearance the likeness of the prodigal son returning to his father’s field. He 
would set him to work immediately hammering out metal sculptures in his 
backyard — which was all his father did these days since his retirement from 
the factory.
All this fancy left Philip as he pulled in front of the house. The house’s 
facade treated its visitors as an affront. It seemed to stand on its hind legs, as 
the front part of the house was only one story and the back part rose up, large­
ly hidden from view by sagging tree limbs, three stories high to dwarf the front. 
The house was vaguely reminiscent of a casde, the part in back like a tower. 
And through sections of window visible through the tree limbs, Philip could 
see the stairs ascending left to right to the second floor, and right to left to the 
third. The third floor was his father’s study. It was called the attic. There his 
father read his favorite books and kept his favorite sculptures. The room was a 
strange combination of fluency and silence, representing perfecdy, Philip 
thought, the two states of mind his father constandy swung between. 
Downstairs, invisible behind the front curtains, was where his mother spent 
most of her time, sitting at the kitchen table. He knew where everyone would 
be and sought out his mother first. He found her in her usual spot, crying to 
herself; on the table a pink, half-eaten birthday cake stood with the candles still 
unlit. His mother did not seem to see him until he was kneeling next to her, his 
head almost touching her knees.
She was wearing her old housecoat. The material was thick and warm and 
decorated with a red floral pattern. He remembered as a child laying with his

generosity — his greatest virtue — was not called for at work; it was a hin­
drance. He was forced to hardball people, to paint them into fiscal corners. He 
was forced to act human in an inhuman atmosphere, and he couldn’t do it. He 
couldn’t smile at his customers. He could hardly look them in the eyes. For this 
reason he was labeled as “Not a people person” on his monthly evaluation. The 
handwriting of this note he remembered distinctly, as it seemed to chuckle 
across the page. And he knew that those in charge of him laughed at him, that 
they found him intolerably quiet and dull and gutless in a world of veiy gutty 
people, a small fish in a big pond. He never sold the highest in the office though 
he did sell the most consistently. For this he had earned the nickname 
“Plymouth Rock” from his coworkers.
Given his nature he should have known that Africa was too exotic, that he 
didn’t belong in a place like that. Yet last week he had decided he would like to 
go there — alone. This decision was based on the vacation time he knew he had 
coming and a brochure he had seen, yellow-bordered with a photograph of a 
deep, dark, wet jungle in the center, inhabited by barely visible birds and snakes. 
The caption at the top had read, “Experience.” On the bottom had been the 
phone number. And he had called it, blindly, desperately, already loosening his 
tie in anticipation as he spoke to the travel agent, strangely not even thinking 
of his parents, but wanting to go alone, to a place where no one knew him or 
wanted to know him. Perhaps, he’d thought excitedly, he would get lost in the 
jungle. Perhaps no one would be there to hear him when he called out. And at 
the thought of him screaming for help in the jungle he heard another voice 
screaming at him, muffled beneath his clothes, that he would find nothing 
there he hadn’t already found. He would be taking no vacation.
This voice made him sweat in his office and further loosen his tie in appre­
hension. But ultimately he had not listened to the voice. And why hadn’t he?
Didn’t his decision contradict his ambitions? He was a terrible son. And today 
was His-birthday, wasn’t it? His mother and father would be expecting him at 
the house. They’d be waiting with a cake. And what would he bring them? This 
news of his wrongdoing. It would be awful for them. He wanted to put it off. 
In the meantime there was nothing for him to do but go to work as though 
nothing had happened. Perhaps if he avoided mentioning it, by the afternoon 
everyone would have forgotten about it. He only hoped his boss could keep his 
quivering jaw shut.
When he walked into the sun-soaked lobby his boss was there to greet 
him, indeed with a snap of the jaw, but it was a soundless exclamation. When 
the boss called him over to the corner of the lobby where he was leaning for­
ward on a car’s front bumper he only asked him why he was late.
“I was detained on the phone,” said Philip. “There’s been a death in the 
family.”
“Close?” asked the boss.
“Not really.”
“Good,” said the boss, “Glad to hear it. I need you to sell me some more 
merchandise. Do you understand what will happen to you if you don’t sell me 
more merchandise soon?”
“I have a pretty good idea,” said Philip.
And he went about the business of selling merchandise, at first relieved 
that his boss had noticed nothing, then alarmed by the fact that not a single 
customer wanted to talk to him. He stood in the lobby all day watching cus­
tomers circle the cars, and when he approached one of them they answered 
curtly, or not at all. He’d never had such a horrible day. Not a single sale. And 
what his boss had said earlier that day: Had he meant it? He began to break out

I just want to dance the mambo
and the rumba and the salsa
and scream out in pure meringue joy
Throwing a suavecito all over the floor
moving my hips in such a way
that even the aloof boys
who are usually too busy thinking about
out of state DJs and their girlfriends' cleavage
begin to fantasize.
And not the brief fantasies of 'what if
Of penetration, of sucking, of his hand on her back
of his leg, inner thighs
full on arroz con polio, five trumpets,
halogen lights, woodfloors, heels,
full on frontal assault
'con permiso' before she's wrapped around
your tailored pant leg, riding you like a pole,
you're the pole, she's the dancer, she's the innovator,
she's the one who smells like chocolate
and feels like rum
She's me, I'm her.
I want to put on a huge production
Torch songs while on skates
I just want to be in an alter-reality
where I could break into 'Strange Fruit'
on the street and get applause from the passerbys
All I want to do is sing back up for James Brown
Sequins and lights, vocals
and light-footed spins
that elicit screams accompanied by
slaps and punches from my
inner post-adolescent nerdy Erica
belting out cries that demand REDEMPTION
pulsating rhythms that make my heart
weave in and out of my ribs
and whip against my vitals
to the slaps of Bootsy's bass
He lets white girls sing with him
if they're funky enough

He was nervous. She sensed that immediately. He was too anxious to 
please, apologizing for the messy state of the apartment, as if he 
wished he could have whisked her away to the Ritz. But she didn’t 
mind. She was more at home here than at any fancy hotel.
“Would you like a glass of wine?” he asked her, pulling off two 
chipped glasses from the uneven shd£ She consented and they say, 
talking of the weather and wine. At die conversation became strained 
she knew that it was time. Why avoid putting it off? They both knew 
why she had agreed to come home with him.
She excused herself, saying that «he had to freshen up. She noticed 
that he really smiled for the first time that night, in anticipation. He 
pointed out the small bathroom and told her that he was going to put 
something more comfortable on.

A
him faster than the cars on the freeway. He met people, spoke to them in the 
warm, intimate tones of his profession, then he sold, or he didn’t sell, and he 
saw none of the same faces again. They took off in their new or old cars, rac­
ing off into waters that weren’t his territory. Not that he wished to follow any 
of these people; they made almost no impression on him at this point in his life. 
Even when they yelled at him, called him a liar and a filthy crook, he sat deep 
in his brown leather chair and felt no anger. They could say what they wanted 
of him, because in strangers’ company he had always felt somewhat removed 
from himselfj hovering above, Ukc a spirit.
The only times he felt invested in his life were the moments he was with 
his family, his mother and father. They lived in a small house by themselves and 
had no friends other than him. They lived for his visits, devoured every free 
minute they had with him like hungry refugees going at a chicken leg, without 
even a thank you to the provider.
But he did not mind them. He lived for their company too. It was as if he 
drew his only breath from the exhalation, the waste, of theirs. He looked for­
ward to his Sunday visits so much as the week progressed that he felt he would 
sink so deep into his brown office chair that no one would be able to see him 
and he wouldn’t be able to move. Yet once he was at his home, perched weight­
less atop the cushion of the dining chair, telling them of his hectic week, he felt 
a disappointment so thick that he remembered why he had left. He looked 
around the rose-decorated kitchen and felt himself a part of the air which 
smelled like syrup, spread like a stain over the whole kitchen. He felt no hunger, 
he had no appetite. He feh desperately tired but wanted there to be no moment 
of rest in his parents’ company. With his overly-boisterous voice he combated 
the substantial silence of the house, a silence - a disappointment - which 
seemed to seep like water through the cracks of his pauses. And his mother and
father looked up at him like two prisoners awaiting a verdict, hanging on his - 
the judge’s - every word.
And now they would be so disappointed in him. Why had he done such a 
stupid thing as die? It was yet another in a string of difficulties, he told himself 
as he knotted his tic. It would probably prove the greatest of all of them. He 
had left his home more than a year ago in pursuit of his own living and his own 
home. He had taken this musty-smelling apartment, small as a glove box, and 
refused his mother’s offers of staying in their much nicer home while he 
worked. He would not stay his mother’s child forever. He would prove himself 
to himself. He would start fresh, and he knew that his mother and father would 
be angry at him for deserting diem but he would make it up to them. In time 
he would grow to be the best at his profession. He would make exorbitant 
amounts of money (which his family had never had) and give it to them so gen­
erously they could no longer be angry at him. He would buy them a bigger 
house and one of the shiny boat-cars in his lobby, and they would cruise up and 
down the freeway towards the cities they’d never seen. He wanted to drive them 
from one edge of the country to the next, shut in together in the aquarium-like 
interior of the car, the only sound being that of their breathing. They would be 
all eyes, watching the sights move by the thick glass: the houses, the fields, the 
plains, the mountains, and finally, like bookends to their odyssey, the water and 
its infinite outward longing, its limitless depth and capacity for giving, taking 
life. His parents would see these things with him, and be amazed. And it would 
be owing to him, Philip, that they felt alive on this journey. They would thank 
him for his generosity, for delivering them to the place they had always want­
ed to go. And they would strip down to their bathing suits and take a dip in the 
ocean together.
That was his dream for all of them, but things had not gone well. His

---------------------------------------------------

THEACCIDENT
Philip was awakened by a phone call in the morning informing him that he had 
died. The mans voice on the other end cracked as though he were calling from 
a great distance, and it told Philip he had been devoured while traveling in the 
farthest corners of Africa by a fur-bearing, sabre-toothed, forest-dwelling crea­
ture with highly polished black claws and emerald eyes. Through the static the 
mans voice seemed to take on a quality of relish as he described the magnifi­
cent and rare carnivore, like a raconteur spinning a ferociously good yarn. 
Philip listened on the other end in silence, swimming in a sea of grogginess. He 
felt wet and his sheets felt salty, and he wanted very much to get up so the 
blood could rush to his head and he could hear the man better. But the heavi­
ness of the air pushed him further into the sunken bed.
When finally the man hung up on him, Philip got out of bed — it was a 
small bed which squeaked so that it sounded like a woman speaking — and 
found his clothes in his dresser. He hated going to work, but hated staying 
home also because he had nothing to do there but lie atop his talking mattress 
and whisper to himself that he was wasting his time sweating and daydream­
ing in bed when he should be working. Always working. He hated selling cars 
because he was not a salesman, yet he liked standing in the sleek, too-air-con- 
ditioned lobby among the masses of shiny sculpted colored metal. Two walls of 
the lobby were floor-to-ceiling windows, looking out over the parking lot on 
one end and the screaming freeway on the other. Outside, the cars looked like 
sharks to him. Inside, they looked like anchored boats in a sea of marble and 
glass. The sun glistened off the car parts. When it was overcast, and the out­
sides of the cars looked drab as everything else, he liked to sit in one of the cars, 
hear the fat clunk of the door as it closed, and feel himself shut inside the 
smooth black envelope of the interior.
But these were idle, rare, single moments among the many which sped by

She walked into the bathroom, carrying her large black purse. 
Whenever she went out for the night she brought that bag. It con­
tained everything she might need for the night: toothbrush, under­
wear, and her diaphragm. She was very pragmatic about her choice in 
birth control. She figured that most men were not interested in wear­
ing a condom and the diaphragm probably protected against disease, so 
she carrie^ftn her black purse for situation just like that nigiS 
The bathroom had an unmistakable odor of mold. She guessed 
that it hadnt been properly cleaned in months. Her date had told 
¦her that he was still in the process of moving in, so things were a little 
'¡dirty. A nice,l|onvenient excuse, but perfectly acceptable.
The faucet dripped, water running down the side of the cracked 
sink. A small medicine cabinet hung over the sink, its warped mirror 
distorting her face.
She heard her date moving around in the next room, pulling out 
the bed from the sofa. Moving with practiced ease, she quickly com­
pleted her purpose and washed her hands briskly in the sink. Her date 
continued his preparations so, out of curiosity and boredom, she 
opened the medicine cabinet.
To her surprise the cabinet was empty, except for one object sitting 
on the lower shelf. It was an old mayonnaise jar filled half-way with 
nail clippings. She stared at it, unable to take her eyes off it. All she 
could imagine was her date faithfully collecting his clippings from his 
toes and fingers and carefully placing them in the jar. She went so far 
as to wonder what the purpose of keeping the nails was. But try as she 
might, nothing could spring to mind that would explain why a normal 
person would keep nail clippings in his bathroom.
She continued to look at the jar as the faucet dripped. She heard a 
soft knock on the door.
“Are you okay in there?” her date asked. He had told her that he 
hadn’t been on a date in years. She had felt sorry for him and didn’t 
even complain when he took her to a movie and didn’t pay for her 
ticket. She never would have imagined that this person who spilled a 
drink on her in a bar would be someone who saved every nail he
¡M* couldri&nswer his question.
|8re you colling out soon?” he asked, somewhat pleadingly.
Th'e 'ffiicet aripped and she reached up and closed the cabinet, 
bringing the picture of her distorted face back into view.
