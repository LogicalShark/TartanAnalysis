Ten Men From Junior and Senior Classes 
Elected to Receive Bids by Tau Beta Piv
Tau Beta Pi, the outstanding engineering honorary on the campus 
recently held its election to determine the select few who will be invited 
to join the fraternity. The first group selected were the honor juniors, Bob 
Riddell, Bob Noyes, and Rodes Trautman. Riddell and Trautman are 
studying physics, and Noyes is a chemistry major. It is the policy of Tau 
Beta Pi to select its new members not only on high scholastic achievement, 
which they must have, but also upon their participation in extra curricu­
lar activities. The three honor juniors are no exception to the rule. Bob 
Riddell is editor of the Thistle, Bob Noyes is editor of the Technical, and 
Rodes Trautman is president of the Y cabinet. All three boys deserve a 
lot of credit.
Several outstanding seniors were also elected. They are: Bill Newton, 
Mech.; Robbert Tobe, Chem. engineer; James Hamilton, .Management; and 
Wally Carpenter, Electrical Engineer. In addition to the above, three well- 
known Tech men who are now in the Army, Bill Purcell, Ed Tennyson, 
and Earl Obringer, received Tau Beta Pi bids.
An especially interesting feature of this year’s Tau Beta Pi selection 
is the nomination of Leo F. Reinartz, a metallurgical engineer who gradu­
ated from Carnegie Tech in 1909. As Carnegie’s Tau Beta Pi chapter 
was not established until seven years after Mr. Reinartz graduated, 
he was not eligible for membership at that time. Mr. Reinartz, who is 
manager of the Middletown Division of the American Rolling Mill Com­
pany, is one of the outstanding metallurgical engineers in the nation, 
and an expert on the open hearth.
He has been a member of the Iron 
and Steel Division’s Open Hearth 
Steel Committee since its inception, 
and has been largely responsible for 
the increasing importance of the 
National Open Hearth Conference 
held in April of each year. Mr. Rein­
artz delivered the Howe Memorial 
Lecture for this year. This lecture 
was established by the Iron and 
Steel Division of the American In­
stitute of Mining and Metallurgical 
Engineers in memory of the Dean 
of American Metallurgists, Profes­
sor Marian Howe.
Many outstanding metallurgists 
and scientists have been previous 
Howe lecturers. At the present, Mr.
Reinartz is cloing valuable war pro­
duction work.

Tech Women Help War 
In Engineering Course
That Carnegie Tech graduates, 
both men and women, are serving 
the war effort was recently reiterat­
ed by a bulletin received by the Tar­
tan from Penn State. This bulletin 
concerns the activities of five Tech 
women who are engaged in Defense 
Training at our state university. 
They are Miss Helen Harrison, Miss 
Beatrice Marsh, Miss Gertrude 
Zweig, Miss Dorothy Buchanan, and 
Miss Camille Brent.
The Tech alumnae are among 
ninety girls, all winners of aero­
nautical scholarships, who began 
their special engineering studies 
this week at Penn State. The girls 
were selected by Hamilton Standard 
Propellers, a division of United Air­
craft Corporation, to prepare for im­
portant jobs as engineering aides. 
Miss Brent and Miss Harrison will 
spend six months at Penn State, 
while Miss Marsh, Miss Zweig, and 
Miss Buchanan will study at State 
College for a year. All five girls will 
pursue studies in the field of design. 
The three girls, who will be at Penn 
State for a year, will get courses in 
physics, chemistry, mathematics, 
applied mechanics, and the study of 
flight. 1
IF Council Functions; 
New Officers Elected
Although original plans called for 
a suspension of the Interfraternity 
Council’s activities until the fall 
semester, the organization will func­
tion this summer. This was the re­
sult of a suggestion by Phi Kap Dick 
Winkler and the support of Dean 
Murphy. It was decided to continue 
the Council on a somewhat curtail­
ed basis during the summer.
Interfraternity Council will oper­
ate this summer under a new plan, 
whereby each fraternity will be rep­
resented by its president. In past 
years the fraternity elected council 
representatives. This year, however, 
it was decided that each fraternity’s 
president should serve on the Coun­
cil inasmuch as they are closest to 
the interests and affairs of their fra­
ternities.
The new officers of Interfrater­
nity Council are President, Reid 
Byers, football playing president of 
the Kappa Sigs; Secretary, Hugh 
Smith, head of the DU’s and basket-

Monday, and wil convene every two

Nazi Decrees Resisted 
By Dutch Students
The long-standing struggle be­
tween the rebellious students of the 
Netherlands and the Nazi during re­
cent weeks has flared into a conflict 
of major scope and significance, with 
the students thwarting the enemy’s 
efforts to make them both pledge 
obedience to Hitler and consent to 
the sweeping Nazi labor conscrip­
tion.
The battle between Holland’s 
18,000-odd students and the Hitler­
ites—one of the most important as­
pects of the German effort to domi­
nate Dutch education—has shown 
clearly that the vast majority of the 
students are one with the rest of the 
people in their opposition to the 
Nazi rulership.
The conflict entered its most acute 
stage last February, when the Ger­
mans announced that the students 
who refused to sign a “declaration 
of obedience” to the occupation au­
thorities would not be permitted to 
attend any university after April 
10. Ninety per cent of Holland’s stu­
dents refused to sign this declara­
tion with which they would deliver 
themselves bound, hand and foot, to 
the enemy. Realizing that this re­
fusal made them forthwith eligible 
to forced labor in the Reich, thou­
sands of students, who could do so, 
went into hiding along with count­
less other Dutchmen who were seek­
ing to evade tyrannical labor con­
scription edicts. But not all succeed­
ed. At least 4,000 students were 
caught and promptly deported to 
Germany where, according to a re­
port in the Nazi press, they are em­
ployed in. “important war work”— 
murderous labor in poisonous lead 
mines.
Although the fight between the 
Nazi and the students has been go­
ing on intermittently since the early 
days of the occupation, the present 
difficulties — featured by repeated

Following Dr. Chworowsky’s res­
ignation as head of the War activi­
ties Committee of Carnegie Tech, 
President Dougherty apointed Pro­
fessor V. G. Parisi to fill this posi­
tion. One of the main reasons for 
Dr. Chworowsky’s resignation was 
his acquisition of new duties, name­
ly chairmanship of the General Fac­
ulty and further assignments in the 
Social Relations Program.
That Professor Parisi is an able 
man to fill Dr. Chworowsky’s place, 
may be seen from the excellent rec­
ords of the War Committee First 
Aid Course, and Blood Donor ap­
peals, all of which Professor Parisi 
was in charge of under the old War 
Activities Committee. Further in­
sight into this man’s ability and 
training which will help him as a 
correlator and coordinator of Car­
negie Tech’s war effort, can be gain­
ed by the knowledge that he was a 
First Lieutenant in the Military In­
telligence during the first World 
War—serving in the Morale Divi­
sion. As head of the War Activities 
Committee Professor Parisi will 
have the nine following sub-com­
mittees under him. They are: the 
CIT War Committee; the American 
Unity Committee; the First Aid 
Committee; the Conservation Com­
mittee; the Fire Protection Commit­
tee; the Publicity Committee; the 
Registration Committee; the Men in 
Service Committee; the Air Raid 
Protection Committee; and the CIT 
Post War Planning Committee.
The last mentioned committee is 
a new addition to the War Activi­
ties roster. This Post War Planning 
Committee will be a discussion 
seminar to air ideas for activities 
and courses to be included in the 
post war Carnegie Tech. It will 
sponsor forums, debates, and polls 
so as to interest the whole student 
body.
Other plans on the agenda of the 
War Activities Committee include a 
series of lecture and demonstrations 
under the guidance of the Tech Cos­
tume Economics and Home Eco­
nomics departments on how to solve 
the War Clothing and Food prob­
lems. Also, a plan to interest the

ACAC Secretary Elected
Miss Sally Bloom, Secretarial Juni- 
or, was elected assistant secretary 
of ACAC as a result of the nomina­
tions held last week. The voting was 
not held due to the fact that Mis 
Bloom’s petition was the only one 
submitted.
Miss Bloom’s duties as assistant 
secretary of the ACAC will mainly 
be carried out to qualify her for the 
secretary’s position when the pres­
ent secretary leaves office. She will 
attend all the meetings and partici­
pate in them as a non-voting mem­
ber.

THE CARNEGIE TARTAN ___________________________TUESDAY, JUNE 29, 1943
------- Letters To The EditorContiue AimcUcun.
Once when we were freshmen, we thought that it must surely be 
wonderful to be the Editor of a paper. We thought that it would be grand 
to be able to write big important editorials about vital issues on Campus. 
In fact, we even formulated a kind of policy to be followed, just in case. 
Our editorials were to be suggestive rather than objective.
But just look what happens, once a fellow becomes Editor. First he 
discovers that no one cares a hoot about important issues on campus. In 
fact, no one cares about the Campus at all. Especially, no one cares to 
read an editorial that has anything to do with anything at all. Then too, 
he soon learns that no matter what he suggests, it just isn’t strong enough 
to shake the students from their lethargy. Whether he is the complaining 
type or not, he is forced week after week to gripe about one thing after 
another. It’s discouraging.
So here goes . . . Your Editor heard complaint after complaint about 
the Grill not being opened on Sundays. With one girls’ dorm, two boys’ 
dorms, at least two fraternity houses, and lots of nearby boarders with no 
place to eat their Sunday meals, we figured it was time for YE TARTAN 
to go to bat. We extracted a promise of action from the administration to 
open the Grill on Sundays, providing enough students would eat there to 
make the plan practicable. A notice was inserted in the TARTAN. Exactly 
28 people responded to it.
Obviously, the students don’t get hungry on Sundays, or they are too 
lazy to care whether they eat or not. Personally the latter presumption 
strikes us as the most logical. And at this point, we frankly don’t care. 
Our final report to President Doherty will be made on Friday of this 
week. So there are still two more days left for you to contact us if you 
want the Grill open.
But now it’s up to you.

Freshmen, Wake Up!
Twenty-five percent of the present engineering enrollment are en­
tering freshman. A class, entirely out of musical proportion has enter-- 
ed what they considered a college, and have been greeted with character­
istic disregard.
That the institute’s object is the production of engineers in a hurry 
does not defend the argument that one-fourth of our present student body 
has no knowledge of their own institution, no organization, no indoctrina­
tion into Carnegie tradition, and no valuable experience that can be looked 
back upon as a full college life.
It is not within our right to prohibit the organization of the freshman 
class. Rather we should favor it, and promote its formation. But the act­
ual activity must come from within. It is entirely up to the members of 
the freshman class to receive the democratic stimulus and react. Organize 
to establish themselves as members of our institution, organize to estab­
lish closer contact among themselves, organize so that the class which en­
tered May 1943 will be a class to be reckoned with.
Past reformists have accomplished the complete abolition of fresh­
man hazing. We neither support nor condemn it—for that is not our prob­
lem today. Our problem is that the action was not taken upon request of 
the freshman class, nor enforced by them. A matter which so directly 
concerns them, should rightly be answered by them, and them only.
The practical setup for organization exists and can be used to ad­
vantage. The freshman class which is divided into seven sections meets 
at Chemistry Lecture in its entirety. It is an advantageous setting from 
which might arise a freshman class government consisting of representa­
tives from these seven sections, with a constructive program of class 
dances, smokers, forums, and a mimeographed newspaper to express its 
policy.
The lack of freshman organization is everyone’s fight, but let us stress 
that the motivating force must be theirs if the effort is to be effective and
withstanding. M. L. G.
Opinions expressed in the pages of the TARTAN are those of the members of the 
staff; in the case of the editorial column they are those of the Editor. They are not 
to be construed as necessarily the opinions of either the student body or the faculty.. i .i—i —i. i n i —.............  ...  .... ......   .................................  run« .in —————— .mi .mm.

Dear Editor:
Since our government instituted 
its program of complete manpower 
regimentation, there has been much 
speculation as to the possibilities 
and desirabilities of an intercollegi­
ate football team here at Carnegie 
this year. The Tartan’s sports edi­
tor, John Lindberg gave an answer 
last wefck to those who questioned 
the possibilities of a team. It can be 
done! Without a doubt there will be 
at least thirty potential football 
players in school next fall. Trans­
portation will be a problem but 
there are many schools within a 
one-hundred mile radius which we 
could meet on the gridiron.
I wish to answer those critics of 
intercollegiate athletics who ques­
tion the need or advantages of plac­
ing a team on the field to represent 
Carnegie Tech. These people insist 
that just as “Business as usual” is 
out for the duration, so also should 
“sports as usual” be out. They con­
tend that it is foolish for our stu­
dents to unnecessarily risk physical 
injury on the football field. They 
also say that football distracts boys 
from their studies that are all-im­
portant now.
In answer to the first criticism, 
let me cite the great number of 
heroes in this war who originally 
built up tKeir bodies on the gridiron. 
Bob McLeod, of Dartmouth, Clint 
Frank, of Yale, and Tom Harmon, 
of Michigan, are only a few. Foot­
ball is emphasized as a physical 
conditioner in pre-flight schools and 
army camps, because it strengthens, 
rather than weakens the player.
As to football being a stealer of 
time, it is unnecessary to look farth­
er than our own campus. Reid Byers 
and John Lindberg, two football 
players, are both fine students and ; 
are engaged in many campus activi­
ties. They play football and still 
find time to devote to other activi­
ties, and so can any other students 
who earnestly wish to do so.
Our soldiers, sailors, and marines 
are constantly reiterating their de­
sire to see football continued during 
this war. If they wish it, so should 
we. Football is a part of the Amer­
ican way of life just as is free 
speech, elections, and college educa­
tion. We at home see our duty to 
keep the American way as close to 
its pre-war status as possible. It is 
possible for Tech to play football 
next year. By all means, let’s get be­
hind any movement to field a squad 
of footballers wearing the colors of 
the Plaid.

Dear Techites:
Once upon a time there was a 
school that had lots of snap. There 
was a certain school in Pittsburgh 
that was buzzin’ with activity. The 
dances were a lot of fun for every, 
one, the football games were inspir­
ed battles even if we didn’t win, 
the dramats were something to 
stand in awe of, the “Kiltie Band” 
was known far and wide. Everyone’s 
“Heart was in the spirit of Tech.”
Then came the war . . .
Now the work is a lot more con­
centrated and it is pretty hot. No­
body gives a darn. “Let’s get our 
work done and go swimming.” “No 
students around anymore.” “Damn 
war.” “No sleep.” “No fun.”
Wake up Tech!
Why not prove to yourself and 
everyone that old Skibo is still kick­
ing. You can still have great dances, 
you can still have fotball teams that 
never say die. What a disgusting 
sight was the last ACAC dance after 
something as much fun as the Spring 
Carnival. Why don’t you guys, and 
all you soldiers, too, help make these 
affairs a success?
C’mon gang—everything’s against 
us, but we have the Army to in­
crease the male ranks, we still have 
an opportunity to dig out the old 
tradition. Wake up Carnegie and get 
on the ball.
Let’s have freshman customs, 
more singing of Tech songs, more 
interest in intramural sports and 
more intramural sprots, another 
football team—more spirit.
Get into the substance of college 
life in spite of the war.

Victorian Literature
Dr. Austin Wright, a Professor in 
the English Department at Carnegie 
Tech, was selected as one of the 
compilers of the Victorian Bibliog­
raphy, which has been published in 
the May, 1942, issue of Modern Phi­
losophy. He was first elected to 
work on the committee last year, 
when he replaced Frederick E. 
Faverty of Northwestern Univer­
sity.
This bibliography was prepared 
by a committee of the Victorian Lit­
erature Group of the Modern Lan­
guage Association of America, and 
William Templeman of the Univer­
sity of Illinois was the chairman. 
This committee has made up a list 
of some of the best publications of 
1942 that have something to do with 
the English Literature of the Vic­
torian Period and similar publica­
tions of the previous year that have 
been omitted from the 1941 bibliog­
raphy. The committee has also 
written short explanations or criti­
cisms of some of the articles that 
were listed.
Compiled by men who have been 
recognized as some of the foremost 
authorities on Victorian Literature, 
the bibliography gives a good list of 
works by modern authors on that 
period. It also makes it easy for stu­
dents of the Victorian Period to find 
criticisms or reviews of works by 
Victorian authors.

Weekly Sings Are Success
The weekly campus sings, which 
are held every Tuesday evening in 
the Sylvan Theatre, have been prov­
ing very popular with civilian and 
army students alike. A large part 
of their success is due to the excel­
lent direction of Bert Mustin, who 
is a Carnegie graduate of a few 
years ago.
The program consists of group 
singing of many old time favorites 
as well as some of the newer songs; 
The selections are made with the 
purpose of presenting a well-di- 
versied program with songs that 
will appeal to everyone. There are 
sad songs, cheerful songs, patriotic 
songs, and just plain songs.
During the evening the group 
usually sings a few Tech songs, and 
yells some cheers.
Last year an ancient tradition was 
broken; girls were allowed to be­
come cheer-leaders for the rst time. 
Those serving were Ruth Means, 
Jean Opdyke, Pat McCullough, and 
Rachel Hansen; it was agreed that 
the girls added color to f ootball 
games, and secured more enthusi­
astic cooperation from the cheering 
section than an entirely male group 
did.

Continued from page one 
student strikes — hark back to De­
cember 9 of last year. On that day 
the German authorities called uni­
versity officials together and, an­
nouncing that the Germans required 
8,000 Dutch students for labor in the 
Reich, demanded the cooperation of 
all school heads. With the exception 
of one Nazi-appointed college presi­
dent, the educators refused to col­
laborate in any way. The Governors 
of the University of Amsterdam met 
and decided to suspend classes “be­
cause of a shortage of coal,” while 
at Delft University students organ­
ized a strike, walking out in a body. 
The Germans sent an urgent appeal 
to Utrecht University, demanding 
that a complete list of registered 
students be submitted immediately 
for the use of Labor officials. That

From the start of the invasion the 
firm anti-Nazi stand of the students 
has been consistently supported by 
the overwhelming majority of their 
professors. The first real trouble 
started at Leyden University in No­
vember, 1940, when the German 
masters openly scraped their prom­
ise not to interfere with Holland’s 
institutions and introduced their 
first anti-semitic laws, among them 
a decree ordering the instant dis­
missal of all Jewish professors from

Flying Results From 
Airplane Design Lab
One of the most disgusting things 
a person can ask a student of aero­
nautical engineering is, “Oh! You’re 
learning to fly!” That is a gross mis­
statement of fact if there ever was 
one, because an aeronautical engi­
neer is not necessarily learning how 
to fly—he is learning how to make 
things fly with other people in them! 
The variety being, raised at Car­
negie Tech is learning how to make 
little piece of paper, folded in the 
correct manner of course, float out 
of a drawing lab window, catch the 
vertical air currents, and fly away 
to infinity—they hope.
Airplanes fly because the air
Holland’s foremost Universities. 
Hardly had they done so, before 
Professor Cleveringa of Leyden Uni­
versity, rose before the student body 
and in an historic address decried 
the dismissal of his Jewish col­
leagues. The next morning Profes­
sor Cleveringa was imprisoned and 
the University was closed.
Since then, and in spite of the ap­
pointment of a growing number of 
Nazi professors, the defiance of both 
students and professors became 
more and more pronounced. Today 
they are a powerful factor in thwart­
ing Hitler’s efforts to mould Hol­
land’s higher education on the Nazi 
pattern, and to secure the coopera­
tion of some of the country’s best 
brains for Hitler’s “New Order.”

across the top of the wing must go 
farther than the air across the bot­
tom; therefore the air shooting 
across the top goes faster, and there 
is less pressure pushing down on top 
than there is pushing up from be­
low. On paper airplanes the idea is 
exactly the same, except that it does 
not require machine design, wind 
tunnel tests, and E-22 to make them 
successful. To fold a piece of paper 
correctly requires only cold, hard, 
bitter, unrelenting experience.
Standard models of airplanes de­
pend on cruising speed and fuel con­
sumption and fuel capacity for 
range. Paper airplanes depend on 
construction experience, correct 
folding, gliding angle, minimum 
speed,- and mostly pot luck for range. 
Still, they fly.
On the whole airplanes are total­
ly incalculable. Paper airplanes are 
more -so. As a result, many of them 
are failures. Air currents are more 
incalculable than the paper vessels 
which ply them. And so winds the 
crux of this sad little tale—i.e., the 
sea of one-time paper airplanes of 
all shapes, descriptions and degrees 
of failure which has for its bed the 
roof over the aeronautical engineer­
ing lab. Desperate failures, or un­
fortunate victims of the villainous 
air currents, these creations in fold­
ed paper rest two stories below and 
almost^ directly beneath the win­
dows from which they were sailed. 
Unseen are the few which through 
good design and amazing luck went 
straight over the bank—a flight con­
sidered to be successful. Maybe 
Tech’s aero’s will be some good after 
all!

Surrealistically Speaking
The end of the world is a fascinat­
ing subject because it includes the 
philosophy of is there or isn’t there 
a religion, which I believe there is 
but a lot of my friends don’t and 
what the hell anyway because I 
don’t expect to be around when the 
world comes to an end and I am not 
going to worry about it anyway be­
cause if it should come I wouldn’t 
have time to worry about it be­
cause it would probably come too 
sudden to even have time to know 
about it, which is the principal rea­
son I am not worying about it and 
does that satisfy you because if it 
doesn’t I have another shirt that you 
might like because it’s just your 
color and yellow is such a pretty 
color except when it’s on a person 
and then he is an Oriental, which I 
do not desire to talk about because 
I think they’re mistreated the poor 
things and I wish we could hurry 
up and bomb the hell out of Japan 
because I want the war to end, but 
I guess I’m just a little too optimis­
tic in that respect, only don’t get the 
idea that I’m an armchair strategist 
because I am not and I do so de­
spise backyard gossipers because 
they seem so destructive.

Hugus Win In West 
Penn Tournaments
Six of Tech’s tennis players are 
taking part in the fifty-fourth an­
nual West Penn Tennis Tournament 
which got under way Saturday af­
ternoon at the Westinghouse Club 
tennis courts. Tech’s record for the, 
first day’s play showed three vic­
tories and three defeats in the men's 
singles and a victory in the doubles 
competition.
A1 Nelesen, Jack Hugus, and Bill 
Griffin each turned in a victory in 
their first match. Nelesen defeated 
Willard Neu in straight sets, 6-4, 
6-1; Hugus defeated Bill Mardaga, 
6-1, 9-7; and Bill Griffin won on a 
default.
The losers in the first day’s play 
were Frank Showman, Bill Lank­
ford, and Monroe Munsell. Show­
man fell before the slashing fore­
hand strokes of George Henderson,
1-6, 3-6; Lankford lost to William 
O’Loughlin 3-6, 4-6; and Munsell 
Was defeated by Robert Lampus, 
ceded number one in the tourna­
ment, 0-6, 1-6.
Showman and Nelesen played 
their best tennis of the year as they 
turned in a well-earned win in the 
first round of the doubles competi­
tion. They defeated Joe Short and 
Sandy Safford, 11-9, 6-3, to put a 
grand finale to the day’s activities. 
These matches are being continued 
throughout the week •

TUESDAY, JUNE 29, 1943THE CARNEGIE TARTAN7
First and Third Platoons Of 
Co. A Lead Leagues Again
Every league was turned, topsy­
turvy last week, with new leaders 
coming to the top as the season near­
ed its mid-point. Cameron Hall took 
over League I by virtue of a win 
over A-5, while A-l and A-3 were 
returning to the top positions in 
Leagues II and III respectively, af­
ter having been temporarily knock­
ed out of those spots last week.
Steve Gaza allowed 11 hits Mon­
day, but his team-mates from the 
first Platoon of Company A came 
through with 14 safeties to beat Beta 
Theta Pi in a slugger’s paradise, 7-3. 
In a low scoring game in which no 
runs were scored after the third 
inning, the A-2 nine, mainly due to 
a three run lead they built up in the 
first half of the opening frame, de­
feated the PiKA’s 4-2. Irwin Brier 
hurled for the losers and was oppos­
ed by Harry Wolfe. The A-4 aggre­
gation battled out a victory over 
the Tau Delts 6-5, led on by Dave 
Wunderlich’s 8 hit pitching.
Tuesday the slugging B-l nine 
smashed out 19 hits off Don Worth 
to walk away with a victory over 
Cedar Hall 26-4, behind Jimmy 
Kellis’ 9 hit hurling. Company B, 
Platoon 2 and the Beta Sigs came 
out of their game with four hits 
apiece, but the Beta Sigs capitalized 
on all of theirs for 4 runs, while the 
Army boys left two stranded on the 
paths, resulting in a Beta Sig vic­
tory 4-2. Irwin Breier did the im­
possible as he gave up exactly no 
hits while the PiKa’s were tramp­
ling the Betas into the dust on the

Cut, 10-0. This was the first no hit 
game of the season, and was a mas­
terpiece worthy of being written in 
the books. The TX’s lost another 
close one, as they allowed the SAE’s 
to push across a run in the sixth 
inning to break a tie of 4 all for a
5-4 victory.
Wednesday, the A-3 nine, al­
though they knopked out only 4 safe 
blows off Bob Scott, tallied six times 
to defeat the struggling B 4&5 boys
6-5. The Third Platoon of Company 
B finally came across with their first 
win of the season as they hammered 
out a victory over the A-2 nine, 9-6. 
Cameron Hall out-ran the A-5 ag­
gregation in a marathon around the 
base paths as a total of 30 runs were 
tallied, Cameron scoring 18 of them 
to the Army’s 12. Citcom had too 
much fight for the Kappa Sigs in 
their game in the Carnegie Bowl, as 
they pushed across 2 runs in the last 
of the seventh to come from behind 
to win 7-6. Arnold of Citcom allow­
ed 9 hits to 10 given up by Perkins 
of the fraternity.
Thursday Jimmy Kellis of the 
First Platoon of Company B set the 
DU’s down with three hits while his 
teammates were garnering fourteen 
off Frank Showman to give the DU’s 
a 10-2 shellacking. The B-3 nine bat­
tled out a 3-2 win over the SAE’s
on Field No. 3 as they garnered 4 
hits off Tom Wylie, while Herman 
Wilhelm let the fraternity men 
down with 2 hits, both of which pro­
moted tallies. The Kappa Sigs went 
down to their fourth straight de­
feat at the hands of the Fourth and 
Fifth Platoons of Company B, as the 
Army men walked away with the 
game 10-2. Bob Scott’s superb hurl­
ing left the fraternity men helpless 
at the plate, and they only succeed­
ed in getting 6 men on base, 4 of 
which were in the last inning as 
“Scotty” tossed them up left-hand­
ed! Cedar Hall forfeited to the Sec­
ond Platoon of Company B and, as 
in all forfeitures, the score was au­
tomatically set at 1-0.
Second Round Seems Likely 
Since the last game in the present 
schedule is for Tuesday, June'29, and 
half the semester is over, the possi­
bility that a second round of each 
league can be run off before the end 
of the semester, is very strong. The 
schedule can be completed in ap­
proximately five weeks, counting an 
extra week for £>lay-offs and post­
poned games. There is also another 
possibility that the leagues will be 
rearranged so that the teams in­
volved will be more evenly matched 
and that many of the lopsided games 
will not occur.

Struggling Reporter Really Enjoys 
His Interview With Ex-Dean Green
By Bill Kolb
After securing an appointment 
with Miss Green for three o’clock 
that afternoon, I began to prepare 
myself for an inevitable ordeal. Bor­
rowing a coat and tie from a friend 
at the house, I proceeded to dress for 
the coming occasion. Oh! why did 
they assign this story to me? Inter­
viewing on a hot summer’s afternoon 
was anything but my idea of pleas­
ure. Nevertheless, time passed rap­
idly and I could feel the hot breath 
of boredom on the back of my neck. 
While debating with myself wheth­
er such a personal sacrifice as this 
was in the call of duty, my feet 
dragged me toward the Ruskin 
Apartments, the present home of 
our ex-dean of women. Finally de­
ciding that the experience would be 
worth it, I entered the Ruskin, ap­
proached the desk and told them 
whom I wished to see. A miniature 
third degree, followed by a call to 
her room and a quiz by the elevator 
man, brought me into personal con­
tact with one of the most charming 
hostesses you could ever hope to 
meet. We sat down and within sec­
onds became aware of many mutual 
acquaintances; this is due to the fact 
that my two older brothers are CIT 
alumni.
Miss Green had been our dean of 
women for some time but was forc­
ed into retirement several years ago 
by a serious condition of her verte­
brae. She soon noticed my discom­
fort and encouraged me to remove 
my coat. It was this action and oth­
ers that made me feel at home in a 
minimum of time. She discussed her 
experiences in Florida, where she 
took up residence after leaving Car­
negie. It was not long before she 
located several Tech graduates in
We Hear ...
Some Yanks were quizzed in Eng­
land recently about what they missr 
ed most. Besides the loved ones at 
home, there were strange answers 
about missing the sound of an 
American bus and the birds and 
flowers found in America.
Another soldier missed the rain 
and wind found in America. “It is 
probably the same wind, but it feels 
and sounds different in the strange 
country.”
A sailor in the Pacific said, “I 
would like to see Mom and Dad, my 
sister, car, my friends, and next, 
just the good old U.S.A. I think that 
everybody should go overseas to 
some far off country and stay away 
from home for as long as I have, and 
they would really appreciate what 
I know as God’s country—the Unit­
ed States of America. I have seen 
places that resemble it a great deal 
in speech, customs, and dress, but 
still there’s that certain something 
lacking that doesn’t make it as good 
a place as home. Perhaps I seem 
homesick, but it’s not that at all, it’s 
just appreciation for a good coun­
try, the best on earth.”

Dear Editor:
We the members of Phi Delta 
Theta were astonished Thursday
the vicinity to make her happiness 
almost complete in this lush, rural 
setting of the South. Tragedy was 
not to be withheld, however, for it 
soon struck in the form of torpedoed 
ships bringing the war to her very 
doorstep.
She seemed quite interested in all 
I could tell her of present conditions 
on campus. It was her sincere hope 
that the de-emphasis on strict ethics 
under wartime strain be controlled. 
She explained more convincingly 
than I had ever heard before the 
value of staying in school and the 
necessity for us, as well as others, 
to recognize this value and do jus­
tice by it.
About this time she graciously of­
fered refreshments to the tune of 
ginger ale and cookies, both of 
which were quite delicious. I then 
learned she has been quite active in 
U.S.O. work, as she recounted sev­
eral curious experiences as a recep­
tionist. In spite of the necessity for 
her to remain on her back a good 
part of the day she still managed to 
keep in touch with people and their 
problems. By now the minute hand 
had completed four revolutions and 
necessity made me take leave of this 
refreshing personality. Dean Green 
can only be described as a lady, a 
real lady.
She assured me that anyone with 
some spare time would be welcome 
for she is very anxious to keep in 
contact with campus activities. The 
Dean plans to spend June, July, and 
August here. Do keep this in mind 
when you feel the need of sensible 
conversation and sincere intellect. I 
assure you it will be worth your 
while, for I left the Ruskin in at least 
one sense of the word, a better man 
than when I entered.
morning upon reading in the Ex­
ponent that we were on Social Pro­
bation. Because we have not receiv­
ed notification of such from the Uni­
versity we wonder if you would re­
veal your source of information?
Does Social Probation mean that 
we will no longer be allowed to con­
tinue having unchaperoned ‘dances,’ 
beer parties, and drinking bouts? 
Does this also mean thai our patri­
otic gesture of relieving the housing 
shortage by quartering women 
guests on our third floor will have 
to be abandoned? Surely when the 
house is taken over by the Navy 
next week we don’t have to discon­
nect our beer pipeline from the 
Chocolate Shop.
While we realize that this is war­
time and that students are here for 
an education, we also hate to think 
of such restriction as Social Proba­
tion that will tend to eliminate the 
basis of the other—and very vital— 
half of a college education.

mobs and crowds, she likes people— 
people with views utterly different 
from her own, people who think the 
way she does, people who are what 
she would like to be and isn’t, old 
people, young people, successful 
people, unfortunate people, chil­
dren, babies—she likes them all. 
And people like her—not because 
she has the only shower on the sec­
ond floor at Whitfield, not because 
they can rely on her advice about 
clothes, not because her room is an 
attractive, comfortable place to loaf 
in—they like her because she is good 
company, can talk well, and is real­
ly understanding. If she decides not 
to be the best-dressed, best-paid 
secretary in the world, she may run 
an orphanage.
Despite her nickname, “Mac,” and 
the mannish spelling of her first 
name (she was assigned to a men’s 
dorm at Miami), she loves clothes; 
tailored ones in blues and greens 
which are really effective with her 
red-blonde hair and blue eyes. To 
“Mac” the extra things that make 
life worth living are perfume, flow­
ers, parties, cokes (not plain ones), 
nice places to dance, and bridge, 
good bridge. Although she says she 
can’t talk intelligently about it, she 
loves opera—popular music, too, but 
not jive. Her favorite reading mat­
ter is poetry, especially that of Ru­
pert Broke and Edna St. Vincent
months to train down to the 200- 
pound maximum permitted for avia­
tion cadets.
One of the graduates of the vast 
West Texas Bombardier Quadran­
gle schools for bombardiers is for­
mer Carnegie Tech student Harry
D. McIntyre. Harry attended Car­
negie Tech from 1939-1942. He was 
an active participant in extra cur­
ricular activities, and a member of 
Beta Theta Pi. Ai Childress, the 
particular school from which he 
graduated, he was given intensive 
training in such subjects as main­
tenance, construction, and operation 
of the super-accurate bombsight. In 
addition to his classroom work, 
Harry had actual bombing experi­
ence equal to an estimated forty 
combat missions. Now he is a full- 
fledged “Hell from Heaven Man,” 
as bombardiers are nicknamed.
Two Carnegie graduates of 1942, 
Robert T. Rathbun and Theodore 
M. Henke, were among the men who 
receceived pilots wings at 5th 1943 
class of graduating flyers at the Gulf 
Coast Training Center’s ten advanc­
ed flying schools. Both boys were 
subjected to 36 weeks of rigorous 
training before they were awarded 
their wings. Before assignment to 
active combat, they will receive 
post-graduate specialized training 
which will prepare them for duty 
as either fighter or bombing plane 
pilots.
They Are All In the 
Army Air Corps Now
Probably not many of the present 
student body remember Pete Do- 
brus, an outstanding tackle for the 
1937 to 1941 football elevens. Pete 
was chosen for the all-Eastern elev­
en of 1941, and after graduation he 
was selected by the Brooklyn Dodg-
Pete Dobrus
ers at the annual professional foot­
ball draft. At present, Pete is an 
Aviation Cadet at Goodfellow Field, 
San Angelo, Texas, where he has 
almost completed his basic training. 
From Goodfellow Field t)obrus will 
go to an advanced school where he 
will become a flying officer. An ath­
lete of 220 pounds, it took him
Millay, but she will settle for prose 
that has a poetic quality. She is one 
of those unusual people who doesn’t 
get bored with her own company— 
she likes to be. alone.
. . . Dorm Council Prexy
She transferred to Tech from the 
Home Ec department of Miami Uni­
versity in her sophomore year. Here 
she is a Secretarial and loves it— 
thinks everyone in Margaret Morri­
son should be in that department. 
“Mac” thinks the expedited pro­
gram is all right—she doesn’t mind 
going to school in the summer—that 
may be because she is quite anxious 
to get through.
She is president of Women’s Dor­
mitory Council, last year she was 
secretary; is on Mortar Board and 
Women’s Guild as Dorm Council 
representative. Her sorority is Gam­
ma Phi Sigma, for which she was 
secretary this past winter.
