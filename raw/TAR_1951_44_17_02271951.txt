VOL. 44—No. 17PITTSBURGH, PA.TUESDAY, FEBRUARY 27, 1951
NSRB Recommends That 
Engineers Be Deferred
Recommemlations 
Are Presented To 
Congress, Pres.
(See editorial “Need for Fore­
sight” on Page 2).
New life was injected into the 
hopes of graduating before army 
induction for most Carnegie un­
dergraduates, with the recent re­
lease of the recommendation of 
the Scientific Manpower Advis­
ory Committee of the National 
Security Resources Board, of 
which President J. C. Warner is 
a member.
Although still in the recom­
mendation stages, and with the 
chance that it may be many 
months befdre Congress takes def­
inite action on the committee’s 
report, the plan calls for a very 
sound solution to the handling of 
one of the country’s basic re­
sources: scientific manpower. The 
report includes recommendations 
for both a long run plan and a 
temporary plan.
Deferment a Possibility 
The committee faced the prob­
lem of devising a program which 
would assure a continuous flow of 
adequately trained scientific man­
power from colleges and universi­
ties in the v ake of the present Se­
lective Service and future Uni­
versal Military Training.
Of prime importance to many 
Carnegie Tech students are the 
suggestions made in the commit­
tee’s temporary plan. To avoid an 
acute shortage of technically- 
trained men in 1952 and 1953, the 
committee recommended the de­
ferment of all second-and third- 
year students now enrolled in col­
lege, provided they continue in 
good standing in their college pro­
grams.
Freshmen May Continue 
Also, a sufficient number of stu­
dents “with special aptitudes in 
science, engineering, or pre-med­
ical studies should be selected for 
continuance in colleges as sopho­
mores in September 1951, in addi­
tion to those in ROTC.”
With regard to entering fresh­
men the committee made the fol­
lowing recommendation: “In addi-
Dr. John C. Warner
On the air tomorrow evening
tion to the flow of ROTC candi­
dates selected by the armed serv­
ices for admission to the freshman 
class in colleges in September 
1951, there should be selected for 
the 1951 and 1952 class to the ex­
tent necessary,, sufficient numbers 
of students with superior aptitude 
for college work in science, engi­
neering, and jpre-medical fields.” 
Graduate Training Endorsed 
The committee also took into 
consideration the necessity of 
graduate training and suggested 
the establishment of a National 
Scientific Personnel Board, which 
would determine and select a 
number of graduates each year for 
graduate study. /
The committee’s final report 
was submitted to President Tru­
man by W. Stuart Symington, 
NSRB chairman, and has already 
been presented to the Prepared­
ness Sub-committee of the Sen­
ate’s Armed Service Committee.
President Warner 
On Draft Forum 
This Evening
President J. C. Warner will 
moderate the first of a series of 
radio forums on the subject, 
“What do college students think 
of the draft for military service?”, 
over radio station KQV tomorrow 
night at 9 o’clock. The broadcast 
will originate directly from Dr. 
Warner’s office.
Each Wednesday night a differ­
ent college will take part in the 
Jorum, with Pitt, Duquesne, PCW, 
and Mt. Mercy scheduled for suc­
ceeding weeks. Several Carnegie 
Tech students will be on the air 
with Dr. Warner tomorrow night 
asking and answering questions on 
the topic which is number one on 
college campuses throughout the 
country.
Although it is expected that in 
general the replies will be aimed 
especially at the proposal to draft
18-year-olds who are in the midst 
of higher education, this evening’s 
forum will undoubtedly tafte into 
further consideration the position 
of the engineering and science stu­
dents in college today.

Nelson, Sawyer Lead Debaters 
To Second Place Tie In Meet
CIT Team Ties With Penn State, Ohio State,
And Bueknell In Mount Mercy Tournament
Janice Nelson and Joan Sawyer with victories over Duquesne, 
Bowling Green,. Allegheny, and St. Vincent, led Carnegie to a second 
place tie with Penn State, Ohio State, and Bueknell in the Mt. Mercy 
Intercollegiate Debate Tournament last Saturday. Bowling Green
placed first in the tournament. ?-------------------------------------------------
The CIT affirmative team of 
Howard Mcllvried and Gerald 
Lessman won over West Virginia
and Pitt but lost to Ohio State 
and Seton Hill. Bowling Green’s 
record of seven wins and one loss 
was just enough to beat Tech’s 6-2 
mark. Bowling Green’s only loss 
was to Tech’s negative team of 
Nelson and Sawyer.
The team of Ronald Curhan and 
Jay Claster, affirmative, and Fritz 
Friedlander and Arnold Sherman, 
negative, also represented Tech 
in the tournament.
A total of 23 teams, representing 
18 colleges and universities, took 
part in the tournament.
The next major test for the de­
baters will be the annual tourna­
ment of the Debating Association 
of Pennsylvania Colleges, being 
held this year at Temple Univer­
sity, Philadelphia, the week-end 
of March 9-10.
Council Absentees
Absent from the last meet­
ing of Student Council were 
the following: Robert Lang, 
Paul Stettler, and Al Abrams 
from Engineering and Science; 
Elvira Loreski and Carol Wil­
son from Margaret Morrison.
Dorm Council Wants 
Inn Open On Sunday
Men’s Dormitory Council got their spring semester under way 
last Monday night immediately following election of officers in the 
various buildings. Discussion of preparation for DC’s participation 
in Spring Carnival and the possibility of opening Carnegie Inn on
?lives. The general theme for all 
the meetings during the week is 
“A Faith For These Times.”
In addition to individual dis­
cussions for fraternity and sorori­
ties, there will be several meetings 
for the entire student body. The 
first of these will be during chapel 
hour when Dr. Edwin Ewart 
Aubrey, chairman of the depart­
ment of religious thought at the 
University of Pennsylvania will 
speak. The meeting will be March 
6 at 11:30 in the Little Theatre.
Also Movies 
Dr. E. E. Aubrey has had much 
training in religious subjects. He 
received the PhB degree from 
Bueknell University and the AM 
and the PhD degrees from the 
University of Chicago. He has 
taught in Union Theological Col­
lege, Chicago; Carleton College, 
Northfield, Minn.; Miami Univer­
sity, Oxford, Ohio; Vassar College, 
Poughkeepsie, N. Y.; and the Uni­
versity of Chicago. For five years 
he was president of Crozer Theo­
logical Seminary, Chester, Pa. Dr. 
Aubrey is also the author of four 
books and has contributed to other 
books and periodicals.
Another open meeting is a 
movie “You Can Change The 
World.” The movie starring Bing 
Crosby, Irene Dunne, Bop Hope, 
and other outstanding Hollywood 
stars will be shown at 4:30 in IH 
231 on Wednesday, March 7.
Another movie open to the pub­
lic is “One God.” Based on the 
book by Florence M. Fitch, it is an 
objective portrayal of some of the 
religious ceremonies and holiday 
observances of the three major 
faiths in the United States; Pro­
testant, Jewish, and Catholic. This 
movie will be shown March 8 at 
9:00 in the Carnegie Inn under the 
sponsorship of the Men's Dorm

Council Finds 
Thistle & Scot 
Books In Red
Tartan And Technical 
Clear; Dean To Attend 
Council Meetings Now
At Student Council’s last meet­
ing Justin Davidson reported on 
the financial condition of CIT’s 
publications. He stated that the 
Technical and the Tartan are in 
the black, but the Thistle and the 
Scot are not doing as well.
The Thistle stands to lose an es­
timated $450 to $500. This may be 
avoided if four or five pages of 
advertisements can be sold be­
fore the Thistle is printed.
At the moment the Scot is in 
debt by an amount of approxi­
mately $480 counting a carry over 
from last year. Editor Jim 
Alemany has obtained new esti­
mates on printing costs, and he 
hopes that with the next issue the 
Scot will become a money making 
proposition.
A petition of Mortar Board for j 
the Senior Ball on June 12, 1951, j 
was approved.
Don Bickelman told Council that , 
Dean Dickinson or Dean David as j 
faculty advisors will attend the j 
meetings from now on if at all j 
possible. J
Sunday dominated tne discussion 
According to plans now under 
way, a booth and racer will be 
entered in the annual celebration 
under Council sponsorship. As in 
several previous meetings, the 
necessity of cooperation from 
dorm residents was stressed by 
president Dick Lutz.
Open Inn 
Having been informed that the 
opening of the Inn on Sundays 
for the benefit of television addicts 
would be impossible for financial 
reasons, DC has decided to share 
the expense of having a responsi­
ble person on hand the extra day. 
It is hoped that this move will ex­
tend the use of the Inn lounge to 
the entire week.
As a result of Monday’s elec­
tions, the following officers have 
been chosen in the dorms. About

Editorials—
Need For Foresight
A recent nation-wide manpower survey conducted by the 
American Society for Engineering Education revealed that 
a minimum of 30,000 graduates from engineering schools will 
be required every year to meet our total defense needs, that 
industry absorbed nearly 50,000 engineering graduates last 
year, and that we cannot count on more than 18,000 in 1952 
or on more than 9,000 in 1954.
These figures go a long way toward pointing out how essen­
tial to national security is the immediate deferment of all col­
lege students who are enrolled in engineering and science courses, 
as recommended by the Scientific Manpower Advisory Committee.
The temporary plan which has been recommended by 
this committee, and is presently awaiting action to be taken 
either by Congress or the President, clearly points out the 
deficiency of the Selective Service’s policy of drafting “any­
one and everyone.” Present Selective Servic laws threaten 
to empty the college pipe line—thus cutting off from the arm­
ed forces, industry and research, potential scientists and en­
gineers who will be needed to meet their growing needs.
Add to these facts, the conservative estimate that the 
Soviet Union must be turning out many more than 30,000 
engineers annually to meet the requirements of an army, 
which by 1954 will reach the staggering size of 12,000,000, and 
it is plain that the Selective Service will have to modify its 
position regarding the necessity of deferring scientists andk 
engineers.
Going on the presumption that both Selective Service and 
Congress are foresighted enough to grasp the meaning of the 
prime necessity of maintaining a proper flow of scientific man­
power, we would give Dr. Warner’s and his committee’s report 
an excellent chantje of becoming, at least in part, a supplement 
to present Selective Service laws in the very near future.
In suceeding issues, the Tartan will endeavor to keep 
up with the disposition of the NSRB report, and to outline 
in a series of articles the long-run plan which this committee 
has recommended.
Anything For A Buck!
Once again that very unsavory atmosphere which has 
always prevailed around “big-time” collegiate sport promo­
tions has exploded in the faces of those who most benefited 
from it—failing to even spare a few innocent bystanders. 
We are referring of course to the current “stink” over the 
fixing of basketball games, involving several basketball stars 
from New York City schools.
Unfortunately, the schools involved stand to lose the most 
for the reckless way in which they fell into the hands of private 
promoters. The promoters, only interested in the money angle, 
care little about the reputation of the schools who’s names they 
are actually “renting.”
Those who have attended any of the college basketball 
games at Duquesne Gardens and have mingled with the 
crowd will admit to the very unhealthy atmosphere which 
the cage game draws in the big arenas—resulting from the 
ever present “hustler” who is after a “quick buck.”
This condition has prevailed at Madison Square Garden 
—only to a greater extent—for more than a decade, and little, 
if anything has been done to correct it.
What’s happened to the meaning behind the reason for 
the existence of college sports during the past ten years?

Four Fashion Shows 
On Institute Schedule
Carnegie Institute announces a 
series of four fashion appreciation 
programs to be held Wednesday 
evenings at 8:15. The Pittsburgh 
branch of the Fashion Group, Inc. 
will co-sponsor the events with 
the Institute’s division of educa­
tion.
¦^jp-fiight names in the fashion 
world have been engaged to con­
duct the programs. It was empha­
sized that the series is a fashion 
appreciation project only, with no 
commercial aims. Proceeds from 
the series will be donated as in the 
past to Carnegie Library for the 
purchase of fashion reference ma­
terial.
Dicuss Hat Designs
The first event will be a spring 
fashion show representing a col­
lection of new styles by leading 
designers in America and Europe. 
Francine Blum, fashion co-ordina­
tor at Gimbel’s, will conduct the 
show. Sally Victor will display
and discuss her latest hat crea­
tions at the program next week.
Programs of the remaining two 
weeks will feature respectively 
bridal fashions plus other new 
women’s wear styles and a dem­
onstration - discussion entitled 
“Vogue’s Eye View of Fashion for 
Spring and Summer.” The former 
event will be demonstrated by 
Nancy White, fashion editor of 
Good Housekeeping. She will tell 
the story of how clothes are se­
lected for the fashion pages of a 
national magazine.
Vogue Editor Conducts
In the last program of the ser­
ies, conducted by an editor of 
Vogue, the audience will hear the 
entertaining story of the huge 
fashion industry as seen through 
the eyes of Vogue’s staff.
Tickets for the four events and 
for single programs are available 
at Gimbel’s, Horne’s, and at the 
Division of Education, Carnegie 
Institute. A special rate is availa­
ble to college students.

LIGHTS OUT . When the 
lights went out over in Industries 
Hall last week, an algebra instruc­
tor, Mr. Pirani, decided he would 
let Mother Sun substitute for Ed­
ison’s invention. Grasping a stub­
born window shade cord, the in­
structor tugged and got what he 
wanted. The shade rolled round 
-and round and plopped on the 
floor.
LOVE FOR SALE . . . There is 
an interesting sign on the bulle­
tin board in Skibo. At the bottom 
of a list of household furnishings 
such as c hairs, crib, table, is the 
prize item. It says “One wife— 
used.”
SWEAT OF BROW . . . One of
the problems that Spring Carnival 
Committee faces may soon be 
solved. The holes surrounding 
campus are being filled in, shovel- 
full by shovelfuil. Of course it 
will take quite a few shovelfulls 
to complete the job. Let’s hope 
Mr. Miller is supplied with plenty 
of shovels.
PRESENT AND COUNTED . . . 
Ohio University has hit upon a 
way to encourage Student Council 
members to attend meetings. The 
newspaper prints the names of 
those absent from Student Coun­
cil meetings. “Attendance has 
picked up considerably,” the news­
paper commented. Could this have 
been a tip for the TARTAN’S 
new policy? (Ed. Note—Why Miss 
Mitchell! You should know us 
better than that).
DUTY CALLS . . . Dean Dickin­
son is in the Navy, for two weeks 
anyway. As a naval officer, the 
Dean has gone to Washington.
THE NOOSE ... To Veterans 
on campus: Nearly 700,000 veter­
ans went into training during 1950. 
They are breathing down our 
necks.
A DILLAR - DOLLAR ... A
Utah State College publication 
wondfers about campus ethics. It 
asks: “What’s coming over us? 
Last Friday night at the game one 
campus chest collection container 
sent through the student section 
failed to show up. Saturday night, 
four more were missing.” Perhaps 
there is a thief in the crowd.
CLUBS ... If anyone says he is 
a BOG, don’t wonder about it. The 
BOG is the Betterment of Grades 
Club, newly organized under a 
Student Council approved consti­
tution. •
HURRAH! ... The TARTAN 
received an All-American and a 
first-class rating for the first and 
second semester of 1950 from the 
Associated Collegiate Press.

Student Poll Discovers 
Scot Has Supporters

With each issue, the Scot gains more publicity and more attention 
from both students and administration. Several weeks ago the Tartan

the Scot. Do the students like the Scot?

It seems students are divided 
in their opinions of the SCOT. 
The magazine does have its merits, 
and certainly other campuses put 
out humor publications that make 
the Scot seem like milktoast. Yet 
the fact remains that the maga­

that tend to the left of risque. The

Friday night they were downed 
by the Little Sekuds as French 
lead the Sekuds scoring with 22 
points.
The American League lead was 
forced into a three way time as 
the Theta Xi ‘A’ team downed the
lane by the score of 33-32. They 
were also downed by the Gunners 
in a ‘Lehigh-like’ slugfest as the 
final tally showed 29 points for the 
Gunners and 28 points for the

Coach Mel Cratsley’s Tartans, 
in one of their most capable per­
formances at the SKlbo Gym, re­
gained their winning ways, 71-61, 
Saturday night at the expense of 
a nine-game Indiana Teachers’ 
victory skein.
Securing the lead early in the 
first quarter, the Skibos were 
never headed. Playing steady, 
consistent ball, the team failed to 
show any signs of the last-half 
letdowns which too often have 
proved disastrous this season.
Although threatened by Indiana 
in the closing minutes of the game 
as the Teachers cut the lead from 
13 to 7 points, the Plaid produced 
a stretch effort to win going away 
by 10 points.
Kaye Thompson and Bill Far- 
bacher paced the win for Carnegie. 
Thompson, who had one of his 
best nights, headed the CIT scor­
ing with 19 points. Farbacher, 
operating against the height ad­
vantage of Indiana’s 6-6 Jim Wat­
son, consistently cleared the back­
boards for rebounds and led the 
defensive play.
Indiana was paced'by Watson as 
he ended the evening with 24 
points and scoring honors for both 
teams. Watson would have had 
more, if an effective Plaid defense 
had not bottled him up in the sec­
ond half and limited him to six 
points.
In a smart defensive move 
Coach Cratsley had the Tartans 
use a zone defense after scoring 
and a switching man-to-man de­
fense whenever losing the ball on 
floor play. The Indianamen were 
unable to cope with this defense, 
and it slowed them down con­
siderably.
The Teachers, with a 12-3 rec­
ord, brought one of the largest 
followings of the year to the Car­
negie Gym. The Skibo rooters 
and cheer-leaders were even out­
numbered by the visitors, who 
brought with them six cheer­
leaders to head their delegation. -

Mermen Complete Best Season 
Since Prewar; Penn-Ohio Next
Coach Claude Sofield’s improved Skibo swimmers finished the 
regular season last week by defeating both W & J and Thiel. The 
two victories gave the mermen a season record of six wins against 
four defeats, the best record at CIT since prewar days.
The attention of the Skibos _
now toward the impending Penn- 
Ohio meet, which is slated for Sat­
urday, March 3, in the Carnegie 
pool. Opponents for the annual 
clash will be Case, Edinboro, Alle­
gheny, Westminster, Slippery 
Rock, W & J, and Grove City.
Indications are that the Plaid 
swimmers stand a good chance of 
copping top honors in the Penn- 
Ohio. Allegheny, which defeated 
the Tartans in a dual meet in the 
Gator pool, and Edinboro, which 
recently upended Allegheny, ap­
pear to be the strongest contenders 
for the title.
However, with such veterans as 
Nick Demas, Dick Kramer, A1 
Macy, Gene Sapper, and Grey 
Duncan, the Scots will be in the 
running all the way. Also, con­
tinued improvement has been 
shown by Weddell, Macdonald,
Houston, and Astle, and they are 
expected to add considerably to 
the point-making potential.
Trial heats in the Penn-Ohio 
will be held Saturday morning, 
with the finals scheduled for the 
afternoon.
In last week’s action, the Tar­
tans experienced little troubel in 
stopping the Prexies, 39-27, and 
the Tomcats, 52-22. Against W & J
Track Candidates
There will be a meeting of 
candidates for the track team 
and track managers on Wed­
nesday, February 28, at 4:30 
p.m. in the office of the Di­
rector of Intercollegiate Ath­
letics, 102 Gym.
All members of last year’s 
team, as well as those who 
wish to try-out for the first 
time, are requested to attend 
this meeting.
Demas and Kramer again led the 
way, the former gaining a first 
and a second and the latter a first 
and a third.
Macdonald and Waddell finished 
one-two in the backstroke, Macy 
took the 440-yard freestyle, and 
Sapper placed second in the 
breaststroke.
The visiting Thiel tankmen 
could win only three events, as 
they were completely outclassed. 
For the Tartans, wins were 
turned-in by Kramer, Demas, 
Duncan, and Weddell, with Macy, 
Anderson, Macdonald, Sapper, and 
Houston copping second place 
points.
? The Betas boosted their record 
to 3 and 0 this week by defeating 
the Tau Delts 3-1. Minor, Dunck- 
lee, and Vaux turned in winning 
sets for the Betas, while Len 
Smollen accounted for the lone 
Tau Delt triumph.
The Kappa Sigs chalked up its 
third consecutive win by down­
ing the ATO’s 3-1. Motter, Offer- 
mann, and Horning scored for the 
winners, while Bowers tallied the 
lone ATO win.
The PiKA’s boosted their mark 
to 4 and 1 by turning in’ victories 
over the Delts and ATO. The Out­
casts however, turned the tide 
against the PiKA’s 3-2. Dick Di- 
Prima, Dale Kirkbride, and Dick 
Bailey won six straight games in 
: turning back the Delts for the 
PiKA’s 3-0. ATO’s Bowers turn­
ed in his team’s only victory as 
' they met defeat 3-1. The Outcasts 
were forced to go to the doubles 
I match to defeat the PiKA’s 3-2. 
j Fred Maston and Bob Munsel 
proved the winning combination.
Beavers Split 
In other games, the Beavers 
split a pair, beating Phi Kappa 
3-1 and dropping a match to the 
Delts 3-1.

Panthers Defeat Skihos 70-45 
To Avenge Previous Losses
The University of Pittsburgh cagers gained revenge for the early 
season setback handed them by coach Mel Cratsley’s Skibos by 
soundly trouncing the Plaid, last Wednesday evening on the Sta­
dium court. The final count was 70-45.
Out to prove that the loss to*——-—------------------------—-------------
Carnegie on the Skibo floor was an
accident, the Panthers went far 
toward doing just that. The re­
cent contention that the Pitts are 
a vastly improved team was fully 
substantiated, as Doc Carlson’s 
proteges outplayed the Tartans in 
every department.
Pitt Rolled Early *
Only for the first few minutes 
of the fracas were the Scots even 
contenders. With ten minutes of 
playing time gone, the score stood 
at 14-11 with Pitt on the long end. 
From that point on, however, the 
men of Skyscraper U continued to 
widen the margin.
Led by Mickey Zernich, who 
scored 13 of his 14 points in the 
first half, the Panthers rolled to
a 33-19 halftime advantage. De­
spite an eight-point rally by the 
Skibos in the early minutes of the 
second half, the Panthers refused 
to be headed.
Craig Scores 16
Mike Belich, who was high- 
point man for the game- with 18 
markers, took over where Zer­
nich left off, and Pitt continued 
the slaughter of the hapless Tar­
tans, who just couldn’t seem to do 
anything right.
High scorers for the vanquished 
Plaid were Tom Craig, who tal­
lied six field goals and four from 
the foul circle for a total of 16, 
and Tom Beck, who meshed 12 
points.

avenge their 73-62 upset at the 
hands of the Grove City Wolver­
ines when they taxe the court for 
their final home appearance. Coach 
Jim Loveless and his squad have 
had one of their best seasons in 
recent years so far, and a second 
victory over the Skibos would as­
sure them an even break for the 
season.
Grovers Almost Even
The Grovers record is eight 
wins and seven losses with only 
two games remaining after their 
encounter with the Skibos.
The scoring punch for the Wol­
verines has been provided all year 
long by tall, rangy Mike Robert­
son, the six foot, four inch center 
who scored 25 points in the last 
CIT-Grove City game. Forward 
George Bartlett and little Fred 
Fetterolf, the 5 foot five inch 
guard, have also proven them­
selves . aluable additions to the 
Grover offense.
This game will give the home 
fans their last glimpse of four of 
the Tartan players in action, as 
Len Bianchi, Bob McCullough, 
Connie Hammann, and Hans Ack­
erman will be making the last 
home appearance of their college 
careers.
Stopped Belich
Len Bianchi will long be re­
membered as one of the best de­
fensive playerc to wear the Plaid 
in many years. One of Bianchi’s 
outstanding defensive perform­
ances of the year was in the first 
engagement with the University of 
Pittsburgh when he was given the 
job of checking Pitt’s high-scor­
ing star, Mike Belich. The suc­
cess of his job is shown by the 
fact that Belich was held score­
less during the entire first half 
of the game, and only scored one 
field goal during the entire con­
test.
Coach Cratsley has used Bianchi 
in the role of playmaker all sea­
son, and his absence will leave a 
big gap in next year’s plans.
«. Westminster Rough
Bob McCullough will be remem­
bered for his aggressive type of 
ball. His ability to control the re­
bounds has helped turn the tide 
in several of the Skibos close 
games during his four seasons with 
the squad.
Saturday evening the Skibo 
forces will encamp to New Wil­
mington to play the Westminster 
Titans, who are at present sport­
ing a record of 18 wins, as against 
5 losses.
In their last encounter against 
the Titans, the Tartans led almost 
all the way, losing the lead in the 
last few minutes of the game and 
finally bowing to the Towering 
Titan quintet by 11 points.
It is a certainty that the Scots 
will find the going rough when 
they play the Titans on their home 
court, where they haven’t lost a 
game in their last 76 encounters.

Dr. Douglas Miner
Heads office of Student Personnel and Welfare
Activities Coordinated 
By Little Known Office
Few offices are more familiar to Carnegie students than the Dean 
of Men’s, Registrar’s, admissions, and health offices. There is an­
other office in Administration Hall worthy of every student’s notice, 
for it is the place where the work of all student service offices is co­
ordinated and supervised. *
The office is that of the director 
of student personnel and welfare,
Douglas Miner. Here the respon­
sibility for all the non-academic 
affairs that concern students lies. 
Dr. Miner is the director of the 
departments of dean of students, 
student health, registrar, admis­
sions, measurement and guidance, 
placements, and athletics. Indeed, 
these departments follow the stu­
dent right from the start until 
graduation.
Discovers Dean 
The chairman of admissions re­
cruits students for Carnegie. After 
the entering student arrives at the 
college, the bureau of measure­
ment and guidance tests him to 
determine what course of study 
will best develop the student’s 
abilities. After the student is here 
for awhile, he discovers the dean 
of students who handles student 
activities, campus organizations, 
loans, and advice to students in 
extracurricular affairs.
Some time or other, the student 
gropes his way to the health de­
partment for aspirins and diag­
nosis. Finally when the student 
is a senior, he turns to the busi­
ness opportunities knocking on 
his door.
Activities Coordinator 
Each of these departments ren­
ders constant service to the stu­

YWCA Cabinet 
Extends Thank 
To Students
Dear Students:
You made the Valentine Cookie 
Sale a huge success.
The student cabinet and the ad­
visory board of the Carnegie Tech 
YWCA would like to take this 
opportunity to thank publicly the 
52 girls from MMCC and Fine 
Arts who contributed cookies. By 
baking over two hundred dozen 
cookies, these girls and their moth­
ers made the project possible.
We also thank the ma«y, many 
students, faculty, and administra­
tive personnel who purchased the 
cookies.
Sincerely yours.

life except the academic, and Dr. 
Miner is the central coordinator 
of the activities of all these de­
partments.
Since 1947, Douglas Miner has 
been Carnegie’s director of stu­
dent personnel and welfare. In 
that time he has rendered efficient 
service to the college. His office is 
indeed worthy of note; it is the 
place where much of the student’s 
college life is recorded in count­
less services.
Love Comedy 
To Be Staged
“Merchant Of Venice” 
Uses Different Setting
A Shakespearean comedy, “The 
Merchant of Venice,” will be pre­
sented by the Drama Department 
March 9-20 under the direction 
of Mary Morris. It is a comedy of 
love and the attempt of one man, 
Shylock, to achieve revenge for his 
persecution by exacting a pound 
of flesh in payment for a debt.
“The Merchant” will be staged 
in the Italian Renaissance sug­
gested by the time and place of 
the play rather than using the 
Elizabethan staging that was com­
mon in Shakespeare’s time.
Perspective New
The play takes place in Venice 
at a time when the vogue in sTag- 
ing was forced perspective. Per­
spective had only recently been 
discovered in painting and the 
stage used elaborate means to 
make a short space look much 
larger. They even raised the back 
of the stage a foot or so in an in­
cline effect to exaggerate space. 
The Carnegie production will have 
a raised stage also.
The costumes, designed by 
Douglas Russell of the drama fac­
ulty, will also be in the style of 
the Italian Renaissance because of 
the charm and grace of that per­
iod. There will be 60 costumes in 
the play, more than the original 
play requires, in order to give 
the production added color. Some 
of these will be from past stock. 
However, about one-half of them 
will be new.
Tickets Next Week
In the cast will be Martha 
Lewin and Jane Harris as Portia; 
Alan Oppenheimer and Sam Meli 
as Shylock; Paul Milikin and 
Thomas Brubaker as Antonio; and

Registration Down
The number of second semester evening schoolL registrants is 
slightly below the resultant total for the first semester. The decline 
is not too alarming, for this has also been the case ir. the past years. 
The number of students returning for the second semester plus the 
number of new students entering Carnegie Tech for the spring term 
is never quite up to a first semester tally.
As of this edition of the Plaid the total of evening students re­
registering for the new semester is 1094. This is broken down into 
the various departments as follows, Engineering and Science 681, 
Industrial Management 135, Printing Management 24, Arts 196, Gen­
eral Studies 32, Margaret Morrison College 26.
The fact that there are only 32 registrants in General Studies 
(the greater percentage of this group are Engineering students) war­
rants a question, “Why isn’t this group much larger?”
Granted that Carnegie Tech is basically an engineering school; 
still we feel that the courses offered in economics, English, psycholo­
gy, and the others in this group are good enough to satisfy the 
most demanding educational palate.
Phi Gamma Pi 
Holds Meeting 
Next Sunday
Annual Spring Banquet 
Scheduled For June 4
Phi Gamma Pi sorority will hold 
a business-social meeting and a 
tea on Sunday, March 4, at the 
Carnegie Union. This tea is for 
introducing new pledges to the 
sorority.
The sorority held its monthly 
meeting on February 18 at Carne­
gie Union. As this was a business 
meeting there was no special 
speaker. However, Mary Episcopo, 
just recently returned from Eur­
ope, showed motion pictures and 
described her trip of Italy. A re­
vision of the constitution was dis­
cussed and approved.
Preliminary plans were made ! 
for a picnic to be held in May at ; 
South Park, and it was decided to I 
have the annual spring banquet I 
June 2 at Webster Hall. Further j 
details concerning these plans will 
be given later.
The annual card party sponsor­
ed by Phi Gamma Pi was held at 
the Carnegie Union on January 
27. This was the second card party 
held in an effort to raise proceeds 
for the scholarship fund and a 
creditable amount was raised 
through the efforts of the girls.
Dance Is Good 
But Few Attend
Washington Day Dance 
Is Sparsely Attended
As someone so aptly put it, 
“The dance was a glowing suc­
cess, but the light went out.” The 
light referred to in this case being 
the light of student interest.
However, the fifty odd couples 
who were there did enjoy them­
selves, as they will be glad to 
tell you. Bill LeRoy’s music was 
good, and his vocalist Jimmy 
Glenn was excellent. The group 
enjoyed the novelty of several 
“Paul Jones” numbers which 
served to mix the couples and 
started a few new friendships.
One of the high points of the 
evening was the presentation of 
the door prize. This handsbme gift 
was designed by James Frappe, 
well-known jeweler and also 
Evening School student. The lucky 
winners were Bill Groll, an 
architectural student, and his 
fiance Delores Hessler.
The pathetic part about the af­
fair is that social chairman, Bob 
Ellstrom, and his assistant, Harry 
Lincoln, advertised the dance well 
in advance, thus nixing the old 
argument that the students are 
never notified in advance con­
cerning the evening student coun­
cil campus dance.

After this winter we believe 
that almost all of the people of 
Pittsburgh and particularly those 
hardy souls who have had to walk 
the cut in the face of a stiff 1950 
zero wind, will have earned mem­
bership into the “Old Timers 
Club”, and be 'Allowed the occa­
sional privilege of spouting-off, 
about the terrible winter way back 
when.
Three evening students were 
among those honored by Pi Delta 
Epsilon, national journalistic hon­
orary fraternity, at its recent ini- 
tition. They were George Bogo- 
vich, Bob Ellstrom, and George 
Schussler.
The registration procedure for 
this semester was reported the 
best ever. The lines were kept 
moving, and there were no ap­
parent hold-ups reported, except 
in the VA line in Thistle Hall, but 
even this line was kept moving 
more rapidly than ordinarily. The 
first stop made by the re-register­
ing Technite of course was at his 
departmental table to see how he 
had fared in last semester studies. 
A sagging chin or a happy grin 
told all to well whether it was 
necessary to take a course over 
or not.
Incidentally we received a let- 
| ter from Ray Schwalm, former 
j Plaid member and staunch Council 
worker, who writes to tell us he 
is now at Fort Sill, Oklahoma.
Jim Frape, council vice presi­
dent, has again won a first prize 
at the Associated Artists’ annual 
exhibit. Jim won the Mrs. Roy 
Arthur Hunt prize for his unusual 
jewelry. The door prize offered at 
the George Washington Birthday 
dance was again one of Jim’s fine 
pieces of jewelry.
Evening student council made a 
| wise choice when it chose Byron 
May as banquet chairman for this 
year’s Engineering and Science 
banquet. Byron has done a grand 
job of any task that Council has 
asked him to do. He will have 
good assistance from Bill Bartolli, 
who is proving to be a willing and 
conscientious council worker.
Recently we heard a dimwit 
refer to the cliquishness of a cer­
tain group of evening students. 
Does this half-mind realize that 
the little that is accomplished on 
the evening school campus is done 
by this small group who above aH 
would like to see a greater num­
ber of evening students take 
enough interest in evening school 
to join their clique.
Don’t want to forget to mention 
that Betty Zelinski, Martha Latza, 
and Kathy Galligan helped at the 
evening school registration. Kathy 
Galligan helped in the IBM room 
in Industries Hall while Martha 
and Betty helped in the Gym.
It is good to see Karl Schwartz 
and Frank Havrilla back on cam­
pus again. Both of these boys 
graduated last year from evening 
school but are back for further 
schooling.
