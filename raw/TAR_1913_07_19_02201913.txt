BASEBALL SCHEDULECARNEGIE’S BEST IN INDOOR 
MEET
The Y. M. C .A. athletic carnival to be 
held at the Exposition Hall next Saturday 
night will be the scene of some exciting 
races if other colleges and organizations 
are represented as well as Carnegie Tech 
will be. The entry list from this school 
includes the names of men who aré well- 
known as athletes from last season, of 
some who gave promise of ability last 
year and of some new ones who attracted 
attention in prep schools. These are de­
termined to roll up as big a score as possible 
for the Plaid.
The greatest interest of the students 
will be centered around the relay team. 
Trials for positions on this team were held 
last Saturday afternoon at the Auditorium 
skating rink in East Liberty, and the eight 
most promising quarter-milers were picked 
from a squad of thirty candidates. The 
meet will be a good indicator for the speed 
of the men that will represent Carnegie 
Tech at the University of Pennsylvania re­
lay races at Philadelphia in April.
A number of interesting athletic events 
are on the program for the evening, and 
many athletes of collegiate and interna­
tional fame will compete.
The list of our entrants and their re­
spective events follow:—
80-yard dash—Captain Crawford,Rauh, 
Jordan.
440-yard run—Marks, Dunseith, Mayer.
880-yard run—Poyntz, Finley.
2-mile run—Hazeltine, Simpsor, Wil­
liams.
High Jump—Murphy, King.
Relay Race—C. Crawford, Walrath, 
Rauh, Merriman, Wildberg, Marks, May­
er, Dunseith.
SENIORS’ PROOFS
We want all the Seniors who have had 
their pictures taken and have received 
their proofs to O. K. them, if they are 
satisfactory and return them at once to 
the photographer. Do not wait to mail 
them but take them to the Design School 
Studio and hand them to the man in 
charge there. We want our glossy prints 
for the engravers and we can not get them 
in time if the proofs are with held .too 
long. Please note this and see if you 
can’t help along the cause by getting your 
proof right back to the photographer.
MATERIAL
All your Thistle material must be in by 
February 25. We ¿ire going to send all 
our stuff to the printer on March 1st, 
hence it will be necessary to demand the 
material you have for us at once. We 
can handle a lot of grinds, short articles 
and the like, so don’t be afraid of causing 
us too much work.
FOOTBALL SCHEDULE FOR 1913
Manager Frank Haaren has justified 
his appointment by the promptness with 
which he has gone after games for next fall, 
as a result of which he has his schedule 
practically completed. Every date is 
now filled, and the card is a good one for a 
team such as usually represents Carnegie 
Tech. Every college to be met is known 
from former years’ contests, and each 
should afford an interesting game.
There is but one criticism to be made of 
the arrangement of the games, and that is 
that is the hardest of the lot is placed on 
the first date. Penn State is, for a while, 
out of our class, although we may soon 
reach her standing. Such being the case, 
it might be better to drop her from our 
schedule until the State managers would 
give us a more favorable date, rather than 
risk the almost unavoidable crippling of 
our light team while not in the best of 
condition.
Three of the eight games will be played 
away from home, but one of them, the 
Geneva game, will be staged so near Pitts­
burgh that an excursion of rooters will 
probably be arranged. Marietta is taken 
on after a lapse of relations for several 
years. Allegheny also has been returned 
to grace, the differences having been patch­
ed up. We hope that the repair work will 
not allow any further leaks. The Tartan 
is glad to note that Haverford will be seen 
on Tech Field next fall. The game last 
November was the first between the 
schools, and was played in the best spirits 
that have ever been witnessed. The re­
lations between the players and the mana­
gers were most cordial after the contest 
and both sides expressed a hope of meeting 
again. The other games need no com­
ment, the colleges being familiar to all
Tech adherents.
The schedule:—
Penn State at State College.............Oct. 4
Waynesburg on Tech Field.............Oct. 11
Geneva at Beaver Falls...................Oct. 18
Grove City on Tech Field................Oct. 21
Westminster on Tech Field.........Nov. 5
Allegheny on Tech Field.................Nov. 8
Marietta at Marietta, O................Nov. 15
Haverford on Tech Field................Nov. 22
SONG CONTEST
Quite a number of students are showing 
great interest in the song contest, and 
from all present indications, there will be 
a gratifying number for final judgment. 
If you have not done anything in this 
matter, get busy at once. We need the 
aid of every single student—yea, of even 
every married one as well. You don’t 
have to be aWagner, or a Chopin to "write 
a school song—all you need is spirit. Re­
member the more songs we get the greater 
are the chances of getting a real Tech Song\
GROVE CITY LOSES IN SECOND 
HALF
The basketball game with Grove City 
last Thursday night was a contest of two 
teams apparently rivaling each other in 
basketball as it should not be played. 
The fives were evenly matched in this re­
spect in the first half and the period ended 
with the score tied at 16 points each. In 
the second half, the home team showed 
some improvement and, in the last ten 
minutes of play, made a creditable showing 
with the result that 10 field goals were 
chalked up against their opponent’s three.
The guarding of both teams was close, 
but the passing and the team-work were 
exceptionally poor. Not one man on 
either team seemed to have an eye for 
direction or a case as to where the ball 
went to after he had thrown it. This was 
especially true in the first period, both 
teams steadying somewhat in the latter 
part of the game.
Criswell and Tumpane were close rivals 
for honors in scoring from the floor. Both 
men were successful in most of their shots. 
Metheny, besides putting up a creditable 
game at guard, scored three times on diffi­
cult shots. Colvin took a number of long 
chances, but his only basket was made 
on a short shot.
Bastress was the star for the visitors, 
his three goals being made from difficult 
positions. His speed also drew favorable 
comment from the spectators.
The attendance of student spectators 
was not quite as large as at other games, 
but much better than at some of the games 
of last year. The usual dance after the 
game was enjoyed by a large number of 
¦ladies and their escorts, as well as by the 
usual crowd of “bachelors. ’ McKee and 
Yahres alternated at the piano.
The line-up:—
Carnegie Tech—41 Grove City 27

Carnegie Tech’s baseball schedule has 
been practically completed by Manager 
Grotefend. In endeavoring to maintain 
a certain standard in athletics, Tech has 
strictly adhered to the rulings of the 
“Western Pennsylvania Conference. ’’ Ac­
cordingly the schedule includes practically 
all the colleges in this vicinity, with whom 
it was possible to arrange games, with 
the exception of W.&. J. and the University 
of Pittsburgh.
The trips taken by the team are short 
and few, in order to conflict as little as 
possible with the heavy schedule of studies 
carried by the students. In April a trip 
will probably be made into West Virginia, 
playing Wesleyan and colleges in that 
vicinity. During Memorial week Tech 
wilt play in Ohio, meeting Mt. Union on 
Decoration Day and Buchtel on May 31st.
The battery candidates have already 
undergone a preliminary workout under 
the instructions of Physical Director Ey- 
man, and next Monday the regular in­
door practice will commence. There is 
some very likely looking new material in 
school, and the contest for the various 
positions promises to be most interesting. 
Outside of the battery, Tech loses only 
one man, Raisig, 2nd base, and with a 
nucleus composed of such veterans as 
Captain Gearhart, Ex-captain Vail, Moor­
head, DeMuth, Wehr and Hall, the pros­
pects for a heavy hitting winning team 
are certainly good. The loss of Carts, 
last year’s star left hander, will be keenly 
felt, and is causing Coach McCulloch a 
lot of worry about the pitching depart­
ment. However the return to school of 
Urquhart, star pitcher two years ago, 
coupled with the advent of. some good 
green material, gives a silver lining to this 
cloud. Gearhart by his great work at 
shortstop, was chosen this year’s captain, 
and with an even break in luck has ex­
cellent prospects of leading a winning team.

BASEBALL CANDIDATES
Baseball men, attention! All candi­
dates report to Mr. McCulIoch at the 
Gym on Saturday, (February 22.) This 
is the first indoor practice of the 
season and we want a good turnout. 
A chance to loosen up and eet in trim, 
don’t miss it fellows.
CLASS OF ’12 BANQUET
Twenty-one members of the Class of ’12, 
School of Applied Science, who are located 
in the Pittsburgh district, banqueted at 
the Fort Pitt Hotel on the evening of 
February 8th.
After the “eats” had been served an 
impromptu business meeting was called 
and business of interest to the Class of 
’12 was discussed.
It was decided to give a scholarship 
of $100 every year to some worthy student 
in the School of Applied Science.
Also the statistics of the salaries of the 
men present were taken. It was found 
that the men present averaged $75.00 
per month, the highest salary being 
$125.00 per month and the lowest being 
$50.00 per month.
Also it was found that the entire twenty- 
one were single, although some were pretty 
far gone. There fates we will know later.
After the meeting, some good stories 
were told and some rare music (?) in­
dulged in.
After singing Amici and the Alma Mater 
and giving a long “locomotive” the bunch 
broke up, their hearts full of dear old 
“Tech.”

“But, sir,” remarked the patient, “vot

WHY HE FAILED
Under the above caption an editorial 
appeared in the Case “Tech” which is 
particularly opportune. We have taken 
the liberty of reprinting it in full. The 
Tartan hopes that all will read it carefully. 
The facts mentioned are not restricted 
to one locality or one college. They are 
general and the remarks mentioned are 
just as frequently heard in Pittsburgh 
as in Cleveland. The editorial is as follows:
The new term offers every man a 
chance to begin over—to start with a 
clean record. Many, it is true, will have 
previous failures before them and a few 
of the freshmen will be excluded from 
college under the eight hour rule. In 
some cases the failure to pass eight hours 
work will result from sickness or a combi­
nation of unfortunate circumstances. Men 
dropped under these conditions very often 
reappear the next fall and succeed in their 
work. It is to those who have “flunked 
out” because of inattention and neglect 
that we wish to appeal.
We all realize that passing the courses 
at Case is not play, yet practically any 
man getting into Case is capable of com­
pleting the course—providing always 
that he devotes a reasonable amount of 
his time to his college work. The man 
who “flunks out” very naturally seeks 
some excuse. There are two which come 
to mind most readily: the work is so hard 
that none but a shark can succeed; or he 
hasn’t received a square deal.
To those who have remained at Case 
and who are well on the way toward 
graduation, the statement that only 
sharks can succeed comes as a touching 
testimonial of their mental ability—a trib­
ute, however, which is worthless com­
mercially. The allegation of a crooked 
deal is an insult to the faculty which a 
man should not give wantonly. Those 
who have “stuck” resent it perhaps more
than the instructors themselves. It re­
flects on them, for it requires a crooked 
man to pass a course given by a crooked 
instructor.
But these are not the most serious 
results. In Cleveland itself there are 
so many Case men that the assertions of 
a few failures carry little weight. Out­
side, however, the condition is far differ­
ent. The choice of a college by a high 
school student is influenced largely by 
the advice of his associates. The adverse 
criticism of one man will be stronger 
than the favorable advice of several. 
The flunker speaks out always while the 
Case alumnus will remain silent. A town 
which has been sending men to Case regular­
ly often ceases suddenly to do so and several 
years will elapse before a man again has 
the courage to dare the attempt. Though 
Case can admit but few more men in the 
institution the loss of prospective appli­
cants cannot be passed by lightly. It is 
not that she wants more freshmen; it is 
merely that the best graduates will be 
turned out when the field of candidates 
for admission is largest and best.
Let the failures tell honestly why they 
failed—and there need be no fear of the 
result.
ANOTHER SEMESTER
Another semester has rolled around 
and those who are through with last 
semester’s work begin again on the same 
old grind. Once more the chance to buy 
some new books is offered to those who 
already are in a badly strained financial 
condition due to the inspection trips. 
Once more the office begins anew in the 
marking up of cuts. Once again the 
fortunate student vows, “This semester
I am going to work.” Once again he 
starts putting things off, forgetting the 
examinations of two weeks ago.
Such is life in a college. If there were 
no semesters there would be no putting 
off of work, no vowing to work, no nice 
clean sheet to chalk down cuts upon, 
and no new books to buy. Would life be 
worth while without all these? No, the 
institution would soon have to shut its 
doors, were it not for the new semesters.
THE NEW PLAN FOR ADMISSION
Elsewhere in this issue will be found the 
statement of the new plan for admission 
to the engineering courses of the School 
of Applied Science. This new plan should 
prove attractive and should draw a high 
type of candidate from the high schools. 
The aim to take cognizance of the special 
training and the ability of the individual 
candidate rather than of a particular school 
is a good one and should prove popular 
among authorities of the preparatory 
schools as well as among the students of 
these schools. Too often a preparatory 
school has lost its certificate privilege, not 
because of the general inefficiency of its 
work, but because certain students have 
managed to get along well enough to se­
cure the certificate only to fail in their 
college work. Dean Leete is to be con­
gratulated upon this change in the en­
trance requirements to his school, and 
The Tartan sincerely hopes that the 
scheme will work out as well in practice 
as it sounds in theory.
Here is an extract from a South German 
newspaper, in which sad consequences of 
bad punctutation are set forth, as follows: 
“After him came Lord Salisbury on his 
head, a white hat on his feet, large but well- 
blaoked boots on his brow, a dark cloud in 
his hand, the unavoidable walking-stick in 
his eyes, a threatening look in gloomy sil­
ence.”—Exchange.

“The Machine Trainers”—in The At­
lantic Monthly for February. Gerald Stan­
ley Lee is an American writer who gains 
more recognition in England than at home. 
He is a thinker who adopts the mechanistic 
conception of things, and then discovers a 
soul in mechanism. The idea of this ar­
ticle is that machinery is the sub-conscious 
mind of the world. “The whole process of 
machinery” he says, “is itself the most 
colossal spiritual achievement in history.
* * * * The idea that matter is not
all alive with our souls, with our desires 
and prayers, with the little terrible wills of 
men, and the spirit of God, is already ir­
religious to us. * * * * The fate of
civilization turns on men who recognize 
the nature of machinery, who make ma­
chines serve them * * * * and who
know when and when not, and how and 
how not, to use them—who are so used to 
using machines quietly, powerfully, that 
they do not let the machines outwit them 
and unman them.”
“How the Iowa State Colleges are Get­
ting together”—The American Review of 
Reviews, February 1913, p. 209, by William 
R. Boyd. Shows the beginning made for

tic Monthly for February. This is the 
fourth chapter of the Autobiography of 
John Muir, the naturalist, whose name is 
indissolubly bound up with the national 
parks of the republic. It is more interest­
ing than a novel.

Drama and the Experimental Sciences.

239, by Albert Bushnell Hart. Shows 
difference between schools of the East 
and those of the West.
The “A” Plebes entertained as visitors 
in Kitchen “A”, certain members of medi­
cal and dental schools Wednesday after­
noon. It just happened that lemon pies 
were emerging from the ovens. The way 
those students gulped them down was a 
credit to our cooking. Whole pies dis­
appeared in a twinkling and invitations 
to return were urgently requested. Now 
Seniors, where are your slams?
Speaking of Gym, did you ever see 
Hazel Thomas go over the box? If not, 
come and watch. She’s a marvel- of dex­
terity only—Why that dull thud?
Grace Saxmann caused considerable stir 
in the Biology Laboratory last Tuesday 
when she wildly bemoaned the fact that 
her beloved “Teeny Crayfish” had been 
rudely kidnapped. We are glad to say, 
however, that Teeny has returned bring­
ing with her Willie Crayfish in the last 
stages of consumption.
COLLEGE ATHLETICS
Since the A. A U. discovered that 
“Jim” Thorpe played summer baseball 
and disqualified him for so doing, there 
has been much talk in the daily papers 
and in the college papers concerning ama- 
teurship in athletics. Many people have 
seen fit to moralize to great length on the 
disqualification. While we can not agree
with many of che sentiments voiced in the 
daily press, we find in the college press 
many thoughts which show the direction 
of the wind, so to speak, and which can 
not but have salutary effects upon college 
athletics in general. The Harvard Alum­
ni Bulletin, issue of February 12th, con­
tained an analysis of the question evry 
pleasing to us and we take the liberty of 
reprinting it in full.
“The widespread moralizing on the dis­
qualification of James Thorpe, the Indian 
athlete of the Carlisle School, cannot but 
have salutary effects upon college ath­
letics. All questions of amateurship in 
athletics are only a generation old in this 
country, and the line between amateur 
and professional, which is so subtly and 
wonderfully drawn, follows different course 
in a country where society is democratic 
and in those where it is aristocratic. In 
the former it must be phrased with some­
thing like legal precision, for it must not 
only be clear, but it must justify itself to 
many persons who have no inherited preju­
dices in favor of amateur players as against 
professional. Indeed, from one point of 
view the distinction, so far as it carries 
any implication of moral or of social super­
iority, is abhorent to a democracy. Just 
as the idea that any reputable mode of 
earning money in a college is menial has 
disappeared in America, so has the idea 
that a man who supports himself or his 
family by playing baseball is to be looked 
down upon.”
“The only distinction * that can be 
maintained between the amateur and the 
professional is the singleness of aim of the 
amateur: he plays for the sake of the 
game, the professional for an ulterior 
purpose of gain. Where the professional 
is openly a professional his standing among 
his friends and the respect for him among 
other people depend on other things than 
his profession. Evil and reproach come 
with concealment, for even in a democacy 
the gentleman is distinguished from the 
other man by being single minded, and in 
making no pretense to being what he is 
not.”
“It is this fundamental fact of the 
state of mind which college men must 
insist on if they are to lead in keeping
amateur sport clean. A graduate who 
secretly supports an athlete helps to make 
that athlete something less than a gentle­
man. There are always cases hard to de­
cide, but in such a case openness is a sure 
solvent of the difficulty. If facts are 
huddled up they breed suspicion, and 
that a gentleman cannot safely undergo. 
When all graduates of colleges insist on 
the recognition of this truth there will be 
fewer puzzles in the matter of amateur 
standing.”

4THE TARTAN
M. M. C. S.
Miss Elizabeth Demarest, assistant 
instructor in history at M. M. C. S., 
won her doctor’s degree at Harvard 
last month. The special field of re­
search was Mediaeval Economic His­
tory.
The College Club recently held a re­
ception at Pennsylvania College, for 
the girls who will graduate from the 
Pittsburgh High School this year. The 
object of the reception was to interest 
the graduates in going to college. Sev­
eral addresses were made, one by Miss 
Holmes; she and Miss Parry acted as 
representatives from our school.
-----o------
Our Alumnae Association might 
profitably take up the question of mem­
bership in the College Club. One 
attempt has been made, we believe, but 
unsuccessfully. Now that the school 
is being put on the College level, it 
is more likely that the club could regu­
larly consider an application.
THE JUNIOR PROM
The Junior Prom, which took place on 
Friday evening, February seventh, was a 
very great success. Praise is surely due 
to all those who worked, in any way, on 
the committees.
The gymnasium, thanks to the work of 
the decorating committee, was “a thing 
of beauty and a joy forever.” Who would 
ever have thought that the old gym could 
ever look so festive! The decorations 
consisted of a lattice of red, forming roof 
and wells of a bower, through which smi- 
lax was twined. The stage was beauti­
fully decorated with palms. The class 
banner had a place of honor in the lunch­
room.
The music was fine, the floor just slip­
pery enough, and the dancing went on 
me rrilv. There were three or four encores 
tc each dance, for the musicians were 
generous. One of the musicians was a 
great singer of ragtime and entertained 
all present.
The lunch came between the eleventh 
and twelfth dances and everyone was 
ready for it. Much credit is due the 
committee, of which Miss Horigan was 
chairman, for the splendid lunch which 
they prepared. It reflected honor both on 
the class and on the school.
The old saying that “Experience is the 
best teacher” certainly was proven, for 
this, the second Prom given by the present 
Junicis, was much better than the first 
and was surely enjoyed by all present.
There is at least one thing that we are 
earning in “Chem Lab”—To chew.— 
From a Junior.
M. M. C. S. BASKETBALL TEAM
Miss Stoner has finally selected the 
basketball team which is to be known as 
the School Team. The selection has been 
made after watching the playing of the 
various players at several games. The 
team is as follows:—
Forward.........................................Pichel, ’16
Forward Jack, '14
Alternate................................................Berry
Centre Pardoe, ’14
Centre (Alternate)......................Keiser, ’16
Side Centre.... Mary Roberts, ’14, Special
Side Centre......................................Booth ’16
Alternate............................Montgomery, ’15
Guards........................................Wentzel, ’14
Guard............................................Menges, ’16
Alternate..................................Spihlman, ’15
After the team has practiced together 
more we expect to have a school team 
which will prove invincible.
THE MOST POPULAR GIRL
Last Wednesday, much excitement was 
caused in M. M. C. S. when it was decided 
that the nominations for the most popular 
in the school were to be taken. One full 
page of the Thistle is to be given over to 
her, and all due honor and respect will be 
paid her. It is a serious question. There 
were four girls nominated from whom the 
real vote is to be taken later. The four 
girls nominated were:
Anna O. Bromley 
Mary Roberts 
Katherine Sawyer 
Lomo Williams.
ANOTHER ONE
The Margaret Morrison girls feel more 
than an ordinary interest in the announce­
ment of the marriage of Miss Cecelia K. 
Bradt to Mr. William Griswald. Miss 
Bradt won the heart of every girl with 
whom she was connected at M. M. C. S., 
and it was with the keenest regret that we 
saw her leave for her new position on the 
Good Housekeeping Staff. However, her 
new work was doomed to have a short 
existence, for it seems that though Miss 
Bradt had left M. M. C. S. she was still 
keeping up her “heart-breaking” business. 
We wish to extend to Mr. Griswald our 
most hearty congratulations, and to Mr. 
and Mrs. Griswald our very best wishes.
It was both a surprise and a treat to 
have them with us at the “Prom.”
O, My!
Lemon pie.
Meringue on top.
Awful hot!
Nice and sweet;
Good to eat.
Boys appear------
None here!
We’re not mentioning names but there 
is one member of the Plebe class who 
invariably emerges from the Gym with 
little rivers of water streaming from her 
dripping hair. Evidently she thinks this 
is a summer resort.

Six little neurones went to school, 
Bent on examination;
They mean to be busy, and not to 
fool,
And always to adhere to that 
praiseworthy rule,
Response to stimulation.
First they go to the history class, 
Record of modern occurrence.

mass
Of European history: Five did not

Sad must be our inference.

ENGAGEMENT ANNOUNCED
At a tea given last Saturday afternoon 
by Mrs. Wyman Robb, at her home on 
Osgood Street, North Side, the engage­
ment of Miss M. Marie McKee to Mr. 
John H. McElhiney was announced. The 
tea took the form of a Valentine Party, 
the house being decorated in pink and 
white.
Miss McKee has been connected with 
the institution practically since it was 
founded, and at present occupies the posi­
tion of Secretary to Director Hamerschlag. 
Mr. McElhiney is a mechanical engineer 
connected with the United Engineering 
and Foundry Company, his home origin­
ally being in Sterling, Kansas. No date 
has been announced for the wedding.
The Tartan desires to extend its con­
gratulations to Miss McKee and Mr. 
McElhiney.
On last Friday afternoon the regular 
weekly meeting of the Pi Kappa Pi De­
bating Society was held in the Design 
Building. Before the program was begun 
six new men took the oath for member­
ship. The program consisted of an ex­
temporaneous debate in which six members 
expressed themselves in behalf of the Af­
firmative and seven in behalf of the Nega­
tive. The subject under discussion was, 
“Resolved that the height of buildings 
should be limited.”
Some interesting points brought out by 
the Affirmative were: That all property 
owners do not have sufficient means or 
do not choose to build high with the result 
that their property is damaged in that the 
circulation of air is lessened, their light 
is cut off and the street is made damp and 
dreary. Again the architect gets more 
commission from a number of small build­
ings amounting to a given floor space 
than he does from one high building of 
the same floor space. Points brought 
out by the Negative were: The conven­
ience of having men of various business 
within elevator distance of each other. 
The danger of fire in a high building fire- 
proofed is less than in a corresponding 
group of low buildings. The high tower­
ing steel skyscraper is the production of 
American architects and therefore should 
be permitted to remain as their contribu­
tion to the Architecture of the ages. The 
judgment was in favor of the Negative 
side.
The subject for a regular debate at the 
next meeting will be: “Resolved that the 
Modern Architecture is better than that of 
Ancient Greece.” In this debate speakers 
O’Brien and Boyer will be opposed by 
Weld and Spigel. This, coming contest 
has started a rush on the Libraries with a 
purpose not hitherto common in the school, 
that of searching for points of argument 
in Architecture. The purpose of these 
debates is to force the members of this 
Society to become at ease while on the 
floor, to talk and think readily off hand, 
to be able to express their thoughts in a 
convincing and entertaining manner, to 
become familiar with the forms of Parli- 
mentary Order, to create an interest in 
research work in Architecture and to keep 
up with the advances of the modern ages. 
Members of this Society are chosen with­
out respect to wThat course they are pur- 
su ng in this institution.
Everybody happy? Sure! We all 
smeared the exams and just one week 
from Friday the Junior Prom.
Prof. McGoodwin had many callers last 
week. We wonder why?
Everybody attended the T. A. C. and 
T. D. C. Hop at the Twentieth Century 
Club.

o9n PLAN OF ADMISSION TO THE 
ENGINEERING COURSES OF 
THE SCHOOL OF APPLIED 
SCIENCE 
Should be Attractive to Candidates 
for Admission
The School of Applied Science has work­
ed 'out a new plan of admission to its engin­
eering courses which promises to be a 
popular innovation with the candidates 
for admission. It consists, briefly, in 
the applying of the certificate privilege 
in a new way. Instead of giving to a 
certified high or preparatory school the 
right to enter its men without examina­
tions, it gives recognition to special pre­
paration and ability of the individual 
candidate by allowing him to enter under 
certain reduced entrance conditions. The 
official statement of this new plan is as 
follows:—¦
In order that we might be assured that 
candidates for admission had the prepara­
tion necessary to enable them to under­
take our courses in engineering with good 
hope of success, and that the subjects 
upon which our courses are based are 
fresh in mind, the School of Applied Science 
of the Carnegie Institute of Technology 
has heretofore required of all candidates 
examinations in certain fundamental sub­
jects.
We recognize, however, that these ex­
aminations do not always afford a fair 
estimate of the student’s fitness for engi­
neering and in some instances are an un­
necessary burden. To meet this situation 
we have decided to admit without exami­
nation in a subject or subjects those ex­
ceptional candidates whose preparation 
is so good both as to quantity and quality 
that there is little question of their ability 
to carry our courses and of their general 
fitness for engineering work.
Our plan contemplates the recognition 
of the special preparation and ability 
of the individual student rather than the 
extension of the privilege of admission 
on certificate to all graduates of a given 
preparatory school. To take advantage 
of this privilege, detailed information and 
specific recommendations will be necessary 
from the principal of the school, a special 
preliminary certificate blank being sent 
to the candidate on receipt of his appli­
cation for admission. This preliminary 
certificate must be filed with the Registrar 
not later than May first, and is to be 
supplemented later by a certificate of 
graduation.
MUSICAL CLUBS GIVE CONCERT 
AT SCHENLEY
The Musical Clubs were given a rous­
ing reception last Friday night, at the 
Hotel Schenley where they appeared in a 
concert lasting two hours. It was a spec­
ial night at the latter resort and the Musi­
cal Clubs were a special attraction. The 
guests all seated in the foyer and dining 
hall enjoyed the concert throughout.
Next Friday night, February 21, the 
Musical Clubs will give a concert at the 
McNaugher school on the North Side.
Next Monday the advance sale of Home 
Concert tickets will be opened by different 
students of the school these tickets can
be exchanged for seats a week later and a 
rebate will be given to all students of the 
school.
LEATHER BOUND THISTLE
The Thistle Board decided at their last 
meeting that this year’s Thistle would be 
bound in the soft, flexible leather binding, 
and further that the PRICE WILL RE­
MAIN $2.00 PER COPY as before. This 
is an exceptional offer we are making and 
we must sell at least 1000 books to get 
out on it. Think, last year you paid 
$3.50 for what we are going to give you 
this year for $2.00. Every one should 
take at least one copy and by the way, it 
would probable please HER immensely 
to receive a handsome leather bound vol­
ume of the Thistle as a May Day gift. 
The Board has been very liberal in its 
desire to put out a nice, new, original, 
clean cut book for 1913 and all the Stu­
dents should appreciate their efforts to 
make this year’s Thistle better and more 
unique than ever before. You can have 
your name printed on the front in GOLD 
for the small charge of 25 cents extra. 
This is the only extra charge we make 
and it is entirely optional whether you 
make use of this offer or not. Receipts 
are on sale by men in every class so there 
is no reason why you should not procure 
one. Only takes one lone dollar to insure 
a nice leather bound book for you. You 
will buy one we are satisfied but “EVENT­
UALLY, WHY NOT NOW? Get busy. 
Run that Thistle representative to death 
buying receipts.
WILSON RECEIVES APPOINTMENT 
TO WEST POINT
W. G. Wilson, who until recently was a 
member of the freshman class in the 
School of Applied Science, has received 
an appointment to West Point from his 
home town, Des Moines, Iowa. Wilson 
left Pittsburgh some time ago to go to 
West Point to take the examinations and 
word was received from him last week that 
he had passed successfully and would enter 
the academy.
Wilson was assistant to the Athletic 
Editor of The Tartan and a member of 
the Sigma Tau fraternity. He is the third 
man to enter West Point from Carnegie 
Tech, both of the other men having now 
graduated. It is interesting to note that 
both of these former Techites graduated 
in the first ten.
THE BUFFALO TRIP 
The Chemists make Interesting and 
Instructive Visits.
Following their usual custom, the Senior 
and Junior Chemists spent inspection 
week making visits at the numerous in­
dustrial plants at Buffalo and Niagara 
Falls. The party, in charge of Dr. Bru­
baker, left Monday morning and went 
direct to Niagara Falls. It consisted of 
Gardner, Hess, Ball, Texter, Nicholson, 
Savage, Ernst, Smith, Boyle, North and 
Mathias.
The first visit was to the power plant 
of the Niagara Power Co. This was fol­
lowed by a trip over the scenic Gorge 
Route and under the Horseshoe Falls.
Only about one third the usual amounr, 
of water was passing over the American 
Falls due to an ice gorge above. They 
said that the day before the brink was 
quite dry. In the afternoon the plants of 
the Carborundum Co. and the Interna­
tional Acheson-Graphite Co. were inspect­
ed.
On Wednesday visits were made to the 
International Paper Co., where newspaper 
is made. The Fitzgerald-Bennie Re­
search Laboratories and the U. S. Light 
and Power Co., the last, manufacturers of 
lead storage batteries, automobile starters 
and car-lighting appliances.
On Wednesday evening the party re­
turned to Buffalo, and the next morning 
went to the Buffalo Smelting Works at 
Black Rock, where copper ore is smelted 
and also refined electrolytically. In the 
afternoon trips were made to the plant 
of Spencer Kellog and Sons, the largest 
linseed oil factory in the country, and to 
the Standard Oil Co., Atlas Works.
Considerable time was spent on Friday 
morning at the plant of the Larkin Soap 
Co., the home of the “Larkin Idea.” 
The return trip to Pittsburgh was made 
that afternoon.
ORGANIZATIONS
Don’t forget that you must get your 
picture for the Thistle at once. The 
studio is always open during the day.
DOPE ! DOPE !
We want more dope. Something funny 
that has happened in your class:—write 
it down—hand it in to the Thistle.
EVENTUALLY WHY NOT NOW? 
It is a cinch you will buy a receipt for 
your Thistle some time. Why wait a 
week or two when you can gart with that 
dollar just as easily now?

The Design Freshmen blossomed out 
in bright green smocks recently.
MACHINERY HALL AS IT WILL BE
“I wonder what Machinery Hall will 
be like when it is finished. Which way 
is it going to face the Campus? Will 
any other department other than the 
Mechanical Engineering be in the new 
building?” We have asked ourselves 
these questions a number of times, and al­
though the work on the new addition to 
Machinery is progressing as rapidly as the 
weather will permit, it is difficult to tell 
at a glance the particluars in regard to the 
finished building.
The improvements are in the form of an 
addition, although the new part will be 
much larger than the original Machinery 
Hall. The old Machinery forms the 
foundation and basement of the south and 
east wing, while the north wing will be 
entirely new. The tower around the stack 
is at the junction of the two wings and the 
main building, the east wing. The front 
of the building faces the east, with the 
main entrance on the first floor, to which 
wide steps lead.
On the lowest floor, which is the founda­
tion floor, is the boiler room, This runs 
from the center of the building and under 
the north wing. Although the entire 
space will not be utilized in this capacity 
at present, it allows for enlargement of 
the plant upon the addition of more build­
ings. The mechanical and transportation 
laboratories, and the engine room will 
occupy the sub-basement. These will be 
in the main east wing, with the engine 
room in the center, and the laboratories 
on either side.
The basement is an entirely new floor. 
There will be two mechanical laboratories 
and two theater lecture rooms on this
floor. The laboratories will be in the 
north and south wing respectively and the 
lecture rooms between. These lecture 
rooms are novel in that they are sound 
and light proof. The lecture demonstra­
tion tables will be fitted with all conven­
iences, as steam, water, air, electricity, etc.
The Electrical Engineering Department 
will also be in this building. The electri­
cal laboratories will be on the mezzanine , 
floor, in the north and south wing, and 
directly back of the laboratories, will be 
the research instrument and store rooms. 
Balconies run around the electrical labor­
atories which open onto the main corridor 
of the first floor. On each side of this 
main corridor are recitations rooms.
The mechanical drafting rooms, and the 
computing rooms for the Electricals will be 
on the second floor; however, the greatest 
feature will be the Mechanical and Elec­
trical club room, which will be on the fifth 
floor of the Tower. A balcony will run 
around this floor so that the members of 
the clubs will be able to view the baseball 
games on Forbes Field without paying 
the necessary price of admission. Field 
glasses will be provided for each member 
so the the details of the game will not be 
missed. The members of the clubs wish 
to have this finished by Spring so as to be 
able to see the opening games. This, we 
are sorry to say, cannot come to pass, as 
the building will not be finished before 
September.
A temporary building that is to house 
the hydraulics laboratory is now under 
construction. It is to be on the west side 
of the Science Building. It will be about 
100 feet long, by 40 feet wide. A large 
tank will be placed in one end.
An addition to the M. M. C. S. will also 
be finished and ready for occupancy in 
Septembe r.

WESTINGHOUSE CLUB INSPECTS 
BUILDINGS
Annual Visit Paid Last Saturday.
On last Saturday afternoon the West’ 
inghouse Club paid its annual'visit to the 
Tech buildings. The party, which con­
sisted of about 25 members of the club, 
was taken in charge by Mr. R. W. Wil­
liams and shown through the various 
buildings in the group. It is unfortunate 
that the visit cannot be made at some 
other time than Saturday afternoon, since 
the student-body would delight in taking 
a hand in entertaining the visitors, but 
the fact that all of the members of the 
club are working on the days in which 
classes are in session precludes this.

INTERCOLLEGIATE NOTES
The Board of Trustees of W. & J., 
have decided to allow the fraternities to 
own houses. The plan is being discussed 
of having the college donate building sites.
With the dedication of a new $50,000 
physical laboratory, Washington and Jef­
ferson college celebrated the 11th anni­
versary of the old Jefferson college in 
Canonsburg.
The features of the day were speeches 
by many prominent visitors and alumni.
The first issue of “The Bauble,” the 
magazine published by the Jesters’ Club 
of Ohio Wesleyan University, has been 
suppressed by the faculty. The reason 
for this drastic action was that on the 
front page of the magazine there appeared 
an article on “berry picking,” which is the 
Wesleyan word for “fussing.”
The faculties of eleven Southern uni- 
veristies have formed a Commission on 
the Southern- Race Question. They aim 
to study the negro problem more thor­
oughly.
The graduate council of Princeton Uni­
versity is taking steps towards reducing 
the expenses of commencement. It is 
said that last year the expense was over 
$40,000.
The faculty at Wittenberg has placed 
a ban upon the tug-of-war stunt, which 
has in the past been a source of great 
interest to the students. The freshmen * 
did not want to pull unless they could 
use their whole class against the sopho­
more class, and the faculty abolished it 
altogether and finally in order to avoid 
dispute.
Stanford University has decided to select 
a new name for their college daily. The 
Daily Palo Alto dues not suit the students 
and they are. receiving suggestions from 
all parts of the state.
Coach Omen, of Northwestern, has in­
vented a novel hurdle which will help 
athletes in going over the hinged stand­
ards. A hurdler, to be in good form, must 
duck his head when he lifts over the hurdle. 
The tendency is to lift the head and trail 
the foot. Hence the coach has rigged up 
an appliance which stretches a string at 
the proper height over the hurdle, thus 
causing a man to duck as he goes over.
West Virginia University has with­
drawn from the Western Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia Athletic League, after 
considerable agitation.
It costs the Athletic Association of 
Minnesota just $3,044.92 to send the 
football team to Chicago last fall.
The Palette Club at the Fine Arts 
School at the University of Kansas has 
become a national honorary society in 
painting and drawing under the name 
Delta Phi Delta.
An anti-hazing bill was introduced 
into the North Carolina Legislature 
yesterday which provides for an imprison­
ment of one year for any hazer. The 
proposed act gives Freshmen the right 
to shoot a Sophomore assailant without 
fear of punishment from the law.—Penn­
sylvanian.
Columbia is Expensive
President Murray Butler, of Columbia, 
in his annual report to the trustees, in­
cluded a summary of gifts to the extent 
of nearly two and a quarter million dollars 
received since June 30, 1911. During the
11 years that Dr. Butler has been the head 
of Columbia, a total of $18,793,896 has 
been received as gifts from benefactors of 
the school. According to Dr. Butler’s 
figures $10,650,000 more is needed.
ELECTRICALS VISIT NIAGARA 
FALLS
Have a Very Busy Time
The Senior Electricals had a very busy 
and profitable week visiting Buffalo and 
Niagara Falls power plants. The party, 
in charge of Prof. Work, inspected the 
following plants: The Niagara Falls Power 
Co., The Hydraulic Power Co., The 
Canadian Niagara Falls Power Co., The 
Ontario Power Co., The Toronto Power 
Co., the district station and transmission 
lines of The Niagara, Lockport and On­
tario Power Co., The Ontario Transmis­
sion Co., and The Hydro-Electric Power 
Commission of Ontario. A number of 
the industries using power generated at
the Falls were also looked over, including 
The Carborundum Company, The Ache- 
son Graphite Co., and The United States 
Lighting and Heating Co.
The party stopped at the Falls, remain­
ing in Buffalo long enough, however, to 
inspect the sub-stations of The Interna­
tional R. R. Co at that place.
There were 13 students in the party. 
While taking in the sights of Goat Island, 
one of the members of the party, M. B. 
Butler, Jr., froze his ear.
THE “LONG CARNEGIE” FOR McIN- 
TOSH HEMPHILL CO.
The students of the Industries School 
had a pleasant week visiting the industrial 
plants in and around Pittsburgh during 
the past week. The trips were thoroughly 
enjoyed and afforded an opportunity for 
the Trade students to study the industrial 
conditions as they exist in the “Workshop 
of the World.”
The Building Const., Machine Const., 
Teachers, and P. M. O. students had 
separate schedules which were followed 
out, being superintended by the instructors 
in the various departments.
Perhaps the most pleasant visit was 
made to the McIntosh Hemphill Co.’s 
plant where on being received at the office 
each student was treated to a cigar. After 
being escorted through* the entire plant 
by the most courteous guides the entire 
visiting party, both instructors and stu­
dents were taken to the Fort Pitt Hotel 
where they did justice to a lunch served at 
the expense of the McIntosh Hemphill Co. 
The courteous treatment and high degree 
of hospitality tendered the visiting stu­
dents and instructors by the officials of 
the company will long be remembered 
by all those who were so fortunate as to 
be with the party.
Say girls! Have you noticed the clouds 
of smoke issuing from room —? The 
Plebes thought it was a fire and rushed 
to the rescue but it was only Prof. Day 
having a little “smoker” in his office.
