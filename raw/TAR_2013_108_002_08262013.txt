Carnegie Mellon’s divi-
sion of Environmental Health 
and Safety released a CMU 
Alert iPhone application last 
Tuesday in order to provide 
students with accessible infor-
mation and resources during 
emergency situations. CMU 
Alert is available through the 
iTunes store and can be found, 
with descriptions of its fea-
tures, at cmu.edu/alert.
Separate from the existing 
CMU Alert system that oper-
ates by email and phone, the 
app provides immediate “in-
formation on what to do in 
various emergency situations 
and how to prevent crimes, 
[as well as] interactive maps 
with information on Auto-
matic External De?brillators 
(AED) locations and campus 
bus routes,” according to the 
app’s description on iTunes.
Details covered by the app 
include safety information on 
bomb threats, mental health 
emergencies, shooters, and 
medical emergencies. The app 
also contains contact informa-
tion and automatic dialing for 
Carnegie Mellon University 
Police and emergency person-
nel, as well  as maps showing 
the locations of AEDs.
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Police Lieutenant Gary 
Scheimer said that the appli-
cation was the brainchild of 
Madelyn Miller, the director 
of Environmental Health and 
Safety.
“[Miller] came to us with 
the topics relevant to CMU 
police and we contributed [to 
the project],” Scheimer said. 
“It wasn’t an easy task to bring 
this about.”
“We’ve been working on 
the app for over a year, and 
we’re thrilled to have it out,” 
Miller said.
Miller emphasized that 
CMU Alert is completely sepa-
rate from the existing CMU 
Alert network. “This app is 
for what to do in the ?rst 10 
minutes of an emergency,” she 
said.
“The issues we focused on 
were scenarios with required 
immediate action, such as an 
active shooter or chemical 
hazard,” Scheimer said. 
Miller added that Envi-
ronmental Health and Safety 
is waiting to hear student 
feedback on the application, 
and the division is currently 
developing a version for An-
droid phones. The iPhone 
version was created by the 
mobile application developer 
DoodleBlue, which released 
a statement about CMU Alert 
that said, “Student safety is 
the top most important pri-
ority of schools and colleges. 
It’s important for students to 
be alarmed and be informed, 
especially in times like these 
when crime rates have shot up 
like nothing seen before.”
The naming of the applica-
tion confused some students 
as to whether the application 
was separate from the existing 
CMU Alert system.
“I think the name of the 
app may be misleading,” said 
junior business major Grace 
Pan. “While this is all infor-

Last week, President Sub-
ra Suresh joined more than 
185 university leaders in 
signing a letter urging Presi-
dent Obama and Congress 
to restore federal funding 
for research and educational 
purposes.
The effort, which was also 
supported by the Associa-
tion of American Universities 
(AAU) and the Association of 
Public and Land-grant Uni-
versities (APLU), urges the 
government to close the in-
novation de?cit.
According to the open let-
ter, which is available to read 
at innovationde?cit.org, uni-
versity leaders from schools 
including Cornell University, 
Brown University, Boston 
University, Tulane Univer-
sity, University of California 
Los Angeles, Case Western 
Reserve University, Yale Uni-
versity, and Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis signed the 
document.
University leaders as well 
as the AAU and APLU are 
concerned about cuts to fed-
eral investments in research 
and higher education at a 
time when other nations are 
pouring resources into these 
areas. According to the Inno-
vation De?cit website, “These 
leaders believe the nation 
needs sustained investments 
in research and higher edu-
cation to develop the ideas, 
people, and innovations that 
power the nation’s econo-
my ... ensuring that the U.S. 
maintains its role as global 
leader. They also believe that 
the growth supported by in-
novation will help the nation 
address its ?scal challenges.” 
The letter, addressed to 
President Obama and mem-
bers of the 113th Congress, 
opens by saying that “our na-
tion’s role as the world’s in-
novation leader is in serious 
jeopardy [because of] erod-
ing federal investments in re-
search and higher education 
[and] additional cuts due to 
sequestration.”
According to the letter, 
the United States’ lack of in-
vestment in research coupled 
with the enormous resources 
other nations are putting into 
these areas has created a so-
called “innovation de?cit.”
Ignoring this de?cit, the 
letter says, will have many 
long-term consequences, in-
cluding a less skilled work 
force; fewer research break-
throughs in science and tech-
nology based in the U.S.; 
fewer U.S. patents; and fewer 
startups, products, and jobs. 
While the letter acknowl-
edges that solutions to many 
of the major governmental is-
sues in the United States are 
unclear, it is clear “that the 
nation’s ?scal woes must in-
clude sustained strategic fed-
eral investments in research 
and student ?nancial aid.”
It ends with a call to ac-
tion, asking the president and 
Congress to “reject unsound 
budget cuts and recommit 
to strong and sustained in-
vestments in research and 
education.”
Anthony Rollett, professor 
of materials science and engi-
neering, both critiqued and 
praised the letter.
“I de?nitely think that it’s 
a good, well-written letter 
and that it is important for

Mitchell Small, H. John 
Heinz professor of civil and 
environmental engineering, 
weighed in on the controver-
sial issue of fracking in a we-
binar for weekly magazine 
Engineering-News Record last 
Wednesday.
The webinar, “Oil and Gas 
Production from Shale, Op-
portunities & Risks,” focused 
on the challenges and oppor-
tunities presented by the rela-
tively new process of natural 
gas extraction from shale.
According to the webinar’s 
description, “The discovery of 
vast reserves of natural gas em-
bedded in shale plays across 
the nation has both trans-
formed the energy debate in 
the United States and created 
enormous controversy.”
The process of extract-
ing natural gas from shale, 
known as hydraulic fracturing 
or fracking, raised concerns 
in environmental, social, and 
economic domains. Fracking 
also presents many opportu-
nities for growth in domestic 
energy production through 
the extraction of previously 
unreachable natural gas de-
posits.
The description for the 
webinar explains, “Although 
the oil and gas reserves in the 
shale formations represent 
huge potential to provide a 
home-grown source of en-
ergy, as well as a wide array 
of construction, engineering 
and production jobs, those 
who work in the industry bear 
great responsibility to ensure 
that drilling, extraction, and 
production of natural gas and 
oil are done without causing 
harm to participants or to the 
environment, particularly the 
water supply and air quality.”
Pam Hunter, associate edi-
tor of Engineering News-Record 
for Environmental Issues and 
moderator of the webinar, 
said, “The discovery of large 
oil and natural gas reserves in 
the United States has changed 
and transformed the nation’s 
energy landscape. The oppor-
tunities for economic growth 
and stability are enormous, 
but with the potential of some 
environmental risks if the 
proper precautions are not 
taken.”
Small, who chairs the Na-
tional Research Council (NRC) 
panel studying risk manage-
ment and governance issues 
in shale gas extraction, sum-
marized the panel’s discus-
sions on shale gas extraction 
and highlighted the potential 
risks and bene?ts of the pro-
cess. Small’s research at Carn-
egie Mellon, according to the 
webinar description, “spans 
mathematical modeling and 
monitoring of environmen-
tal systems, uncertainty, and 
risks.”
Small speci?cally pointed 
out seven potential problems 
with fracking, including op-
erational risks, degradation 
of water and air quality, global 
climate change, ecological im-
pacts, human health impacts, 
and social impacts. He cited 
projections from the U.S. En-
ergy Information Administra-
tion that predicted a large in-
crease in the use of natural gas 
driven by shale extraction over 
the next 25 to 30 years, while 
other methods of obtaining 
natural gas will stay level or 
even decline. Small discussed 
the impact that cheaper, more 
available energy could have in 
the United States.
His focus was also on frack-
ing’s environmental impacts, 
including on water quality and 
air quality. 
The fracking process can 
also create methane leakages, 
which contribute to global cli-
mate change.
Fracking presents many 
governance issues. Accord-
ing to Small, the industry 
lacks federal oversight, leav-
ing much of the control in the 
hands of state and local gov-
ernments. This has important 
implications for how the pro-
cess will affect nearby com-
munities, economically and 
socially.
“The oil and gas industry 
is largely exempt from federal 
environmental regulation…. 
Most of the action is at the 
state level, and the question is, 
how do you have effective co-
ordination between state and 
local governance, as well as 
industry self-governance, and 
what role do local communi-
ties, environmental groups,

Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity’s Open Field Entrepre-
neurs Fund (OFEF), adminis-
tered by the Carnegie Mellon 
University Center for Innova-
tion and Entrepreneurship, 
awarded $250,000 to ?ve 
startup companies. 
The fund was established 
by alumnus and creator of 
the Flip Video camera Jona-
than Kaplan and his wife, 
Marci Glazer.
The OFEF is designed to 
provide early-stage ?nancing 
and support to Carnegie Mel-
lon alumni looking to start 
their own companies. Twen-
ty-one startups have been 
given grants from the fund 
since its June 2012 inception.
“Carnegie Mellon is truly 
an engine of innovation. 
This cycle of OFEF includes 
three companies that arose 
from faculty and Ph.D. can-
didate research,” said David 
Mawhinney, co-director of 
the Carnegie Mellon Center 
for Innovation and Entre-
preneurship and managing 
director of the OFEF, in a uni-
versity press release.
“In addition to our out-
standing curriculum and 
world-class research, the 
continued involvement of 
our alumni network is some-
thing that we are most proud 
of — people like Jonathan 
Kaplan, whose generos-
ity and commitment toward 
helping the next generation 
of entrepreneurs has made 
the OFEF possible,” she said.
In the past 15 years, over 
300 companies and 9,000 
jobs have resulted from Carn-
egie Mellon’s entrepreneurial 
campus culture. The com-
panies receiving funds this 
year are Lumator; NetBeez; 
QuantMD, LLC; ToolsCloud; 
and Vibrados. “It is exciting 
to see our young alumni cre-
ating such interesting com-
panies,” said Lenore Blum, 
co-director of the Center for 
Innovation and Entrepre-
neurship.
“These companies are 
based on years of cutting-
edge research and bring real-
world solutions to everyday 
problems and challenges.”
The OFEF provides 
$50,000 in matching invest-
ment to each recipient. Re-
cipients also gain access to 
other funding sources, re-
ceive personalized mentor-
ing, and attend an annual 
OFEF business workshop.
Mentors assigned to each 
recipient will include select 
Carnegie Mellon alumni who 
have themselves been suc-
cessful entrepreneurs, having 
helped to create over $1 bil-
lion in shareholder value.
Mentors will also in-
clude entrepreneurs based 
at Carnegie Mellon, such as 
Mawhinney.

CMU researcher wins engineering prize
Kaushik Dayal, an associ-
ate professor in the mechan-
ics group of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s civil and environmental 
engineering department, 
recently won the Leonardo 
Da Vinci Award from the 
American Society of Civil 
Engineers.
Dayal received the award 
for his research on the inter-
actions between materials 
and electromagnetism that 
has potential applications 
for energy storage and gen-
eration.
“I’m delighted to receive 
this recognition of our re-
search into the behavior of 
electromechanical and elec-
trochemical materials at the 
nanoscale,” Dayal said in a 
university press release.
Dayal is looking to create 
smaller batteries with higher 
energy density and faster re-
charge times than those cur-
rently on the market.
Dayal’s research focuses 
on energy storage, which 
could have important appli-
cations for intermittent pow-
er sources like solar energy, 
which is produced during 
the day but not at nighttime.
Dayal’s research is funded 
by the Army Research Of?ce, 
the Air Force Of?ce of Scien-
ti?c Research, and the Na-
tional Science Foundation.
“This is great recognition 
for an innovative researcher 
who is making important 
contributions to [the] mod-
eling of materials critical to 
renewable energy systems 
and other technologies,” Da-
vid A. Dzombak, head of the 
department of civil and envi-
ronmental engineering, said 
in a university press release.
The Leonardo Da Vinci 
award was established in 
2011 and recognizes young 
researchers early in their 
careers for promising devel-
opments within the ?eld of 
engineering mechanics and 
mechanical sciences with 
speci?c relevance to civil en-
gineering.
In 2012, Dayal received 
the Army Research Of?ce 
Young Investigator Award, 
the Air Force Of?ce of Scien-
ti?c Research Young Inves-
tigator Prize, the National 
Science Foundation Career

et cetera play in the overall 
process?” Small asked.
Fracking also carries pos-
sible bene?ts. 
It has a smaller carbon 
footprint than traditional 
coal, meaning that substitut-
ing natural gas from shale 
extraction for coal produces 
fewer greenhouse gas emis-
sions. Small also summarized 
his personal viewpoints in 
two workshops hosted by the 
NRC panel. 
The ?rst panel was on 
the risks of unconventional 
shale gas development, while 
the second focused on gov-
ernance risks of unconven-
tional shale development, or 
the regulation issues created 
by shale development and its 
current lack of oversight.
Small stressed that the 
committees were not meant 
to reach an absolute consen-
sus, and that they comprise 
members’ separate opinions.
On his slide about the ?rst 
workshop, Small wrote that 
“to build [a] scienti?c knowl-
edge base and trust, [there is 
a] need for coordinated col-
lection and sharing of data to 
characterize background pre-
development conditions, op-
erations, human and ecologi-
cal exposures and effects, and 
economic and social impacts 
on nearby communities.”
The second workshop, 
Small said, included discus-
sions of the existing capac-
ity to meet governance chal-
lenges, shale gas governance 
in other federal systems, and 
the potential roles of non gov-
ernmental entities in fracking 
governance.
After Small, the webinar 
included talks from Andy 
Shea, industrial sector direc-
tor of the Resources Business 
Group, and Sunil Kommineni, 
national practice leader in

the academic community to

the general idea that the real 
damage is to long-term com-
petitiveness.  For example, 
we are leaders in large ma-
chines like accelerators, syn-
chrotrons and free electron 
lasers (that have very large

Rollett also said that he

stricting the pipeline of highly 
trained people.”
Sophomore creative writ-
ing major Kaytie Nielson 
believes that further govern-
ment-funded research could 
have both positive and nega-
tive repercussions. 
Nielson, who is a Fulbright 
Summer Institute Participant, 
said, “More funding for re-
search would be great. But 
like with corporate funding 
of university research, depen-
dence upon government fund-
ing might cause the research 
to respond to particular politi-
cally motivated interests.”
mation that can be found on 
CMU websites, it is helpful 
that it is in a centralized loca-
tion and it is more accessible.”
Further student reaction 
to the development of the 
new application is mixed but 
hopeful.
Sophomore economics 
and math double major Ben 
Zhang likes the idea of the 
safety application, but said he 
could envision future prob-
lems with it. “I just see two 
main issues with it: getting 
people to install the app and 
getting people to not delete 
the app,” he said.
“I feel like it would be use-
ful, but I’m kind of the person 
that says, ‘Well, I won’t using 
it frequently, and I’m going to 
assume the advice they give is 
pretty much common sense’ ” 
Zhang added.
Junior computer science 
major Mindy Pile said, “It 
sounds like a pretty great 
idea, especially since most 
people don’t know how to 
handle certain natural disas-
ters or deal with in an emer-
gency medical situation.”
Pile did mention some pos-
sible improvements. “How 
useful it is also depends on 
how easy it is to navigate. 
Having the emergency num-
bers and CMU police numbers 
listed front and center would 
be a good thing.”
Environmental Health and 
Safety personnel are asking 
students to continue provid-
ing feedback on the applica-
tion and its features.

A movement started in 
recent years to digitize docu-
ments from the past in order 
to preserve an area’s history. 
Lending its efforts to secure 
local history, Carnegie Mellon 
contributed to the digitizing of 
Jewish newspapers through 
the Pittsburgh Jewish News-
paper Project. The project con-
tains a digital archive of vari-
ous Jewish newspapers in the 
Pittsburgh area, some dating 
to more than 100 years ago.
The of?cial website of the 
Pittsburgh Jewish Newspaper 
Project explains that the ar-
chive contains various Jewish 
publications, including the 
Jewish Criterion, the Ameri-
can Jewish Outlook, the Jewish 
Chronicle, and a weekly publi-
cation by the Young Men and 
Women’s Hebrew Association 
of Pittsburgh. 
Head of archives and digi-
tal library initiatives Gabrielle 
Michalek spearheaded the six-
year long project. 
According to an article 
in the Jewish Chronicle, the 
Pittsburgh Jewish Newspaper 
Project is “a digital archive 
documenting daily life in the 
Pittsburgh Jewish community 
from 1895 to the present.”
Joy Braunstein, director of 
the Holocaust Center of the 
Jewish Federation of Greater 
Pittsburgh, said, “I think it’s 
phenomenal, and I’m glad 
that someone is taking the ini-
tiative to do this. I think it will 
be an interesting and valuable 
resource, from the academic 
perspective ... to laypeople or 
individuals who want to look 
at the history.”
“I know that they’re do-
ing this as a digital resource, 
which is fantastic so that peo-
ple can go online and look at 
it, and I’m incredibly support-
ive. If you are a graduate stu-
dent, you would ?nd this to be 
absolutely invaluable. Same 
for someone doing their own 
genealogy, by looking at their 
family’s history and people 
searching for their family’s 
wedding dates,” Braunstein 
added.
According to its website, 
the Pittsburgh Jewish News-
paper Project is a collabora-
tion between Carnegie Mel-
lon University Libraries, the 
Rodef Shalom Congregation 
Archives, the Rauh Jewish 
Archives at the Senator John 
Heinz History Center, and the 
Jewish Chronicle of Pittsburgh.
“The Jewish newspapers in 
Pittsburgh cover not just local 
events but regional, national 
and international news over 
a long period of time,” Rodef 
Shalom archivist Martha Berg 
said in an interview with the 
Jewish Chronicle. 
“They really give a won-
derful depiction over time of 
a community as it grew and 
changed, and they’re very 
valuable to have.”
The project was aided by 
contributions from the Jew-
ish Federation of Greater 
Pittsburgh, the Philip Chosky 
Charitable Educational Foun-
dation, and donations to Carn-
egie Mellon in memory of 
Henry Posner Jr.

HOW THINGS WORKHow preservation keeps your food bacteria-free
NIHARIKA SINGH
Staffwriter
Incoming ?rst-years al-
ways recieve a ton of advice: 
go to of?ce hours, make new 
friends, try out new restau-
rants. Among these pieces 
of advice is one that warns 
students that hot plates and 
other similar cooking appli-
ances are not allowed in dorm 
rooms; they’re ?re hazards. 
Stripped of these cooking ap-
pliances, many students turn 
to preserved foods in their 
quest for a rejuvenating mid-
night snack. Humans have 
been preserving food for hun-
dreds of years to ensure they 
would have stores of food in 
tough conditions like famines 
(and ?nals week).
The purpose of food pres-
ervation is to ensure that 
bacteria do not reproduce. 
When bacteria multiply in 
food, they release waste that 
causes the food to look, smell, 
feel and taste bad. Certain 
pathogens can also cause the 
spoiled food to become toxic. 
According to Arimi Foods, the 
same bacteria that cause food 
to spoil also thrive in warm 
temperatures in the range of 
room temperature to 104°F. 
This is why one of the most 
common methods of preserv-
ing foods is refrigeration. The 
cold temperatures present 
inside a fridge slow down the 
reproduction of bacteria. Kept 
this way, most foods tend to 
last for about a week.
However, temperature can 
be lowered further to keep 
food safe for longer. The freez-
er, which uses below-freezing 
temperatures to store food, 
keeping it fresh for months. 
Since water is no longer avail-
able to the bacteria, they 
are not able to grow or react 
chemically with foods.
Canning is another way 
to preserve foods. This can 
take take the form of produce 
canned at home, or factory 
canned food available in su-
permarkets. In both cases, the 
food is heated to kill bacteria 
present at the beginning of 
the canning process. After-
wards, the food is put into an 
airtight container and sealed, 
preventing new bacteria from 
entering the food. Foods pre-
served this way can keep for 
several months. 
Canning also has the ad-
ditional advantage of not re-
quiring the energy needed to 
maintain a low temperature 
continuously, like in refrig-
eration and freezing. For this 
reason, canned foods are pop-
ular in disaster-relief kits and 
emergency kits, as they can 
keep for a long time and be 
consumed in situations where 
power is not readily available.
Yet another popular food 
preservation technique is 
drying. This technique works 
because drying food removes 
all moisture, which bacteria 
need to grow and react with 
foods. An advantage to drying 
is that dried foods take  up less 
space to store than food pre-
served by other means, says 
the College of Agriculture, 
Consumer, and Environmen-
tal Sciences at the University 
of Illinois. However, drying 
changes the taste and appear-
ance of foods unlike other 
forms of food preservation. 
To dry food, www.dryit.com 
explains, it is placed where 
warm dry air can move past 
it continuously. This warm 
air absorbs the moisture from 
the food and carries it away, 
thus dehydrating the food. 
Dried foods are often further 
vacuum sealed to keep them 
safe for longer. According to 
fantes.com, vacuum sealing 
ensures that the foods don’t 
come into contact with oxy-
gen. Without oxygen, oxida-
tion of the food cannot take 
place. Furthermore, bacteria 
cannot thrive in a vacuum.
Food is an essential hu-
man need, and human inge-
nuity lets people have food 
even when it is not readily 
available in its natural form. 
So while incoming freshmen 
might not be able to prepare 
their favorite meals in the 
comfort of their rooms, they 
will be able to snack on a vari-
ety of preserved foods. 
Or they could just order 
pizza.

Scientists produce edible meat from cow shoulder cells
The future of food has tak-
en a new direction with the 
invention of lab-grown meat. 
Mark Post, a Dutch researcher 
from the University of Maas-
tricht, has pioneered a way 
of growing meat using stem 
cells (cells that can differen-
tiate into tissue-speci?c cells) 
from cow shoulder muscle. 
The cells were multiplied in 
a nutrient solution and put in 
petri dishes, where they grew 
into muscle cells and formed 
strips of muscle ?ber, a pro-
cess which was developed 
through a $325,000 project.
A ?ve-ounce burger was 
made from 20,000 strips of 
?ber, breadcrumbs, salt, and 
some natural colorings. While 
the lab-grown burger received 
subpar ratings in its taste test, 
it has introduced the idea of 
cultured meat to the world.

Robot uses slime to express different set of emotions
Ella Gale, a researcher at 
the University of the West of 
England in Bristol and the 
Bristol Robotics Laboratory, 
has discovered a way of us-
ing slime mold to give emo-
tions to robots’ faces. Slime 
mold, although unicellular, is 
able to ?nd the quickest path 
to food and has even shown 
signs of having memory. 
Gale has developed a way 
of expressing emotions on 
a human-like robot face by 
hooking up the robot face so 
that its expressions are con-
trolled by electrical signals. 
These signals are produced 
when slime mold shies away 
from light or moves towards 
food. Because slime mold pro-
duces electrical signals as it 
moves across electrodes, Gale 
and her team were able to as-
sign different emotions to dif-
ferent signals.

Researchers look into evolution of the X chromosome
 The X chromosome has 
typically been considered the 
“female” chromosome, and 
the Y the “male.” This would 
suggest that since the second 
X chromosome in females is 
disabled, its evolution was 
slowed down and its genes 
would be similar in most 
mammals. 
However, recent studies 
show that it is not only the Y 
chromosome that contains 
the genes responsible for sex 
determination, male devel-
opment, and male fertility. 
Rather, the X chromosome 
has been found to contain 
genes that are only active 
in tissue that is destined to 
become sperm. After se-
quencing human and mice X 
chromosomes, geneticists dis-
covered that there are a lot of 
unshared genes between the 
human X and mouse X, indi-
cating that the X chromosome 
may have undergone evolu-
tion.

Live tissue and organs produced by 3-D printers
3-D printing has gained 
increasing popularity in the 
past few years, with 3-D print-
ers for the home recently be-
coming feasible. However, 
the newest breakthrough in 
this form of manufacturing 
technology is the 3-D printing 
of live tissue. Researchers at 
Hangzhou Dianzi University 
in China have developed the 
Regenovo 3-D printer. 
Regenovo prints living 
tissue — in particular, it has 
successfully printed small 
human ears. Several months 
ago, a team at Cornell Uni-
versity were also successful 
in the 3-D printing of ears. 
At Organovo in San Diego, 
researchers are working on 
3-D printing of fresh human 
livers. The development of 
these kinds of technologies 
may revolutionize the world 
of biomedical engineering, 
facilitating surgeries such as 
organ transplants and making 
them more personalized.

Dolphins respond to unique sounds of their own ‘name’
It is a well-known fact 
that dolphins communicate 
with each other with clicks 
and whistles. However, a new 
observation has been made: 
Dolphins actually respond se-
lectively to signature whistles, 
the same way a human being 
would respond to someone 
calling their name. This ?nd-
ing is one of the ?rst examples 
of naming in mammals and 
suggests that there is a paral-
lel between dolphin and hu-
man communication. 
Biologists recorded sig-
nature whistles and played 
them, along with computer-
synthesized distortions of 
them, through a hydrophone 
in Scotland’s eastern coast. 
The wild bottlenose dolphins 
ignored unfamiliar whistles 
while whistling back to their 
own signature whistles.

Researchers take on complicated privacy policies
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
How does Amazon know 
what deals will catch your in-
terest? How does Facebook 
know what ads to show you? 
Most people are unaware of 
the fact that websites collect 
information about us all the 
time. “A fundamental aspect 
of privacy is that people are 
supposed to have control over 
what happens to their infor-
mation,” said Norman Sadeh, 
a Carnegie Mellon professor 
of computer science. He is the 
leader of the Usable Privacy 
Policy Project, a 42-month, 
$3.75-million project spon-
sored by the National Science 
Foundation whose goal is to 
improve internet privacy.
The research team working 
on this project includes Lor-
rie Cranor, associate profes-
sor of computer science and 
engineering and public policy; 
Alessandro Acquisti, associate 
professor of information tech-
nology and public policy; Tra-
vis Breaux, assistant professor 
of computer science; Aleecia 
McDonald, director of privacy 
at Stanford University’s Center 
for Internet and Society; and 
Joel Reidenberg, a Fordham 
University law professor.
Websites are supposed to 
inform users when they collect 
information. These privacy 
policies should answer con-
sumer questions about how 
and for what purpose they 
collect user information, and 
with whom the information 
will be shared. Every major 
website should have a privacy 
policy that can be easily found 
there. 
But some question the ac-
cessibility of these policies. 
“It’s easily accessible if access-
ing means being able to get to 
the page, but it’s not easily ac-
cessible if access is supposed 
to also include the ability to 
quickly digest the text and 
make sense of it,” said Sadeh. 
The problem is that many pri-
vacy policies are not only ex-
tremely lengthy — averaging 
?ve to seven pages in length 
— but also very complex and 
dif?cult for a layperson to un-
derstand. In fact, a 2008 study 
conducted by Cranor and Mc-
Donald estimated it would 
take 200 to 300 hours for a 
person to read privacy policies 
for every website they visited 
in a year. 
Another study conducted 
at Carnegie Mellon tested 
people’s comprehension of 
privacy policies. After reading 
a range of policies, individuals 
were asked very simple com-
prehension questions, such as 
if the website collects email 
addresses or shares informa-
tion to third parties. Although 
these questions are supposed 
to be answered clearly in pri-
vacy policies, 50 percent of the 
people who read them could 
not answer these questions 
correctly.
In the past, some people 
have tried to force standard-
ized formats, such as present-
ing policies in the form of mul-
tiple choice questions or yes/
no answers that could easy 
convey to their users what type 
of information the website col-
lects. Another attempt was to 
encourage websites to write 
privacy policies in machine-
readable language. However, 
these endeavors have been 
met with a lot of pushback 
from the companies who write 
these policies.
The Usable Privacy Policy 
Project team has been study-
ing new methods of making 
privacy policies more trans-
parent for consumers. One 
such method involves the 
modeling of people’s privacy 
preferences. “We’ve shown 
through research over the past 
few years that even though 
people care about privacy, 
they don’t actually care about 
everything these privacy poli-
cies talk about. They only care 
about a relatively small num-
ber of factors,” Sadeh said. So 
it turns out that there are just 
a few things in these policies 
that need to be highlighted in 
order to convey the informa-
tion consumers care about 
most.
Another direction that this 
group is taking is combin-
ing machine learning with 
crowdsourcing. The machine-
learning aspect involves using 
computer programs that can 
detect patterns of text within 
privacy policies in order to ex-
tract information from them. 
Along with the contributions 
from crowdworkers, machine 
learning can ensure that priva-
cy policies will be understood 
on a large scale. This informa-
tion can then be presented to 
consumers in the form of user 
interfaces or browser add-ons 
that can rate the safety of web-
sites with color codes or letter 
grades — almost like a nutri-
tion label.
Privacy engineering is be-
coming an increasingly impor-
tant ?eld, particularly because 
people who write privacy pol-
icy tend to be lawyers, while 
people who build the products 
tend to be software engineers. 
Carnegie Mellon is launching 
a new master’s degree pro-
gram in privacy engineering.
“The long-term hope is that 
when information becomes 
more easy to digest, compa-
nies will realize they have to 
be more aware of their privacy 
policies,” Sadeh said. The re-
searchers hope that, at some 
point, companies will even 
start competing with each 
other and using safer privacy 
policies to set them apart 
from other companies, ulti-
mately improving privacy on 
the web.

Scientists make discovery in ?eld of synthetic biology
MICHAEL SETZER
SciTech Editor
When moving through a 
bustling crowd, you probably 
think about how much more 
ef?ciently you could get to 
your destination if you were 
the only one there. While this 
train of thought might make 
sense with regards to daily life, 
researchers at Carnegie Mel-
lon have found that crowding 
within a cell may actually in-
crease its ef?ciency.
The study was led by 
Cheemeng Tan, a Lane Post-
doctoral Fellow and a Branco 
Weiss Fellow in the Lane Cen-
ter for Computational Biology. 
The research team also includ-
ed Russell Schwartz, professor 
of biological sciences; Philip 
LeDuc, professor of mechani-
cal engineering and biological 
sciences; Marcel Bruchez, as-
sociate professor of biological 
sciences and chemistry; and 
Saumya Saurabh, a doctoral 
student in chemistry. Their ar-
ticle was published in the jour-
nal Nature Nanotechnology.
With hopes to offer new 
therapeutic treatments for dis-
ease and new energy sources 
in the form of biofuels, the 
?eld of synthetic biology could 
have a huge impact in the 
?elds of medicine and tech-
nology. Although the ?eld is 
about big solutions, research-
ers are beginning to look very 
small. Tan and his team specif-
ically looked at the effects of 
molecular crowding on gene 
expression in cells.
In the ?eld of synthetic 
biology, scientists have been 
trying to create synthetic cells. 
These cells are pieces of tech-
nology that act similarly to 
the cells within our body but 
whose genomes — the blue-
print for all cellular mecha-
nisms and development — are 
entirely created in a laborato-
ry. The point of creating these 
systems is to minimize the 
information present in a cell. 
For example, if a researcher 
wanted to know the effects of 
a cancer drug on one particu-
lar protein, the cell would only 
include the genetic informa-
tion needed for that protein 
and basic cellular function. 
These arti?cial cells, however, 
lack a phenomenon common 
in most living cells: molecular 
crowding.
Molecular crowding refers 
to the density of macromol-
ecules in a cell. Living cells are 
?lled with these molecules, 
which can refer to carbohy-
drates, proteins, and nucleic 
acids — all the stuff needed 
for a cell to function to prop-
erly. Scientists in the ?eld of 
synthetic biology are unsure 
if crowding can enhance the 
gene expression in a cell. In 
other words, having more 
stuff in a cell may create faster 
circuits to turn on and off cer-
tain genes. Tan and his group 
wanted to see if molecular 
crowding does in fact have 
an effect on gene expression, 
which is the process of activat-
ing a certain gene to encode a 
protein.
In their experiments, the 
researchers utilized a bacterio-
phage — a special kind of virus 
that infects bacteria — called 
T7. The researchers manipu-
lated the molecular crowding 
in the phage and then studied 
the impact on the expression 
of a particular gene. They ac-
complished this by using dif-
ferent sizes and densities of in-
ert polymers in environments 
similar to the arti?cial cells. 
Larger, denser polymers were 
meant to mimic a crowded en-
vironment. Inert polymers are 
made up of multiple subunits 
and are nonreactive.
The results showed that 
molecular crowding does in-
deed improve the robustness 
of gene expression in living 
cells. More ef?cient gene ex-
pression occurred in the tri-
als with the larger polymers. 
Furthermore, the group found 
other ways to increase the ef-
?ciency of gene expression by 
changing the concentration of 
certain ions in their experiment.
The group’s study provided 
new information that may 
help bioengineers develop 
better synthetic systems that 
include effects similar to mo-
lecular crowding. “Our ?nd-
ings underscore how scientists 
could harness functioning 
mechanisms of natural cells 
to their advantage to control 
these synthetic cellular sys-
tems, as well as in hybrid sys-
tems that combine synthetic 
materials and natural cells,” 
Tan said in a university press 
release.

Songwriters who are stumped 
while writing a pop hit — or maybe 
a dance jam to rock the club scene — 
seem to do what so many have done 
in the past: Write a love song. From 
medieval odes to anything on Taylor 
Swift’s latest album Red, we’ve been 
writing love songs for a long time.
There’s nothing wrong with the 
musical world’s history of writing 
about love. Love is a complicated 
and deep emotion that can inspire 
great songwriting. It seems these 
days, though, that so many artists 
just ?ll an entire album with love 
songs, be they lamentations or glo-
ri?cations. Having a few love songs 
on an album is understandable —  
love is a central part of the human 
experience. But is there nothing else 
in this great and beautiful world to 
write about? People have been writ-
ing love songs since they’ve been 
writing songs, and there certainly 
doesn’t need to be another album 
full of them.
As a writer myself, I can see the 
temptation that songwriters have 
to write love songs. Love is a pow-
erful emotion and one of the few 
intimate experiences that can be 
commonly understood. That com-
mon understanding means that it 
is much easier for a songwriter to 
spark a moment of connection with 
an audience, something I think of as 
a good goal for any song. However, 
some artists — Taylor Swift comes 
to mind again — abuse the easy 
connection that a love song grants 
and use it to pump out cookie-cutter 
hits. Writing about an emotion also 
lends itself to abstraction. Listening 
to an album with 12 songs full of ab-
stractions leaves me dissatis?ed and 
mindlessly humming the one catchy 
song on the album. It doesn’t leave 
me with anything to think about or 
give me an appreciation for the orig-
inality of the writing.
We should not stop writing about 
love. It is too important an emotion, 
and I’m sure people will continue 
to ?nd original things to say about 
love for a long time. All I ask is that 
songwriters branch out and not re-
treat into abstractions about love. 
Instead, they must write songs that 
touch on the full gamut of emotions 
and experiences that life offers. Lis-
teners should be told a story or im-
pressed by clever wordplay.
Songwriters, follow the lead of 
Sara Bareilles: Don’t write me a love 
song. Explore the scope of human 
nature and emotions in your song-
writing, and paint a more complete 
picture of the world we live in with 
your lyrics.
Please don’t write me any more love songs

Violent military crackdowns 
against protesters in Egypt last 
week called into question the con-
tinuation of U.S. military aid to the 
country. The protesters, rallied by 
the Muslim Brotherhood, support 
recently ousted president Mohamed 
Morsi. According to Amnesty Inter-
national, over 1,000 people have 
been killed in these crackdowns.
The U.S. supplies $1.5 billion in 
military aid to Egypt annually. Given 
the recent atrocities, critics are call-
ing for that aid to be immediately 
suspended. However, the situation 
in Egypt is both extremely complex 
and deeply delicate, and the mili-
tary aid is not as simple as it seems.
The U.S. is not simply handing 
Egypt money; Egypt is part of the 
Foreign Military Financing program 
(FMF). More than 70 countries are 
part of this program, including Is-
rael, Pakistan, and Colombia. Coun-
tries involved in the FMF are given 
certain funds that can only be used 
to purchase military equipment, 
and only from American contrac-
tors. Egypt does have a remarkable 
amount of freedom within this sys-
tem, but it is not the only one; Is-
rael enjoys a similar liberty. Once 
Egypt orders a shipment of military 
equipment, U.S. contractors build it 
and send it. However, the U.S. can 
block or suspend shipments. While 
the U.S. has not of?cially cut aid, 
they have suspended the delivery of 
Egypt’s military orders inde?nitely. 
By delaying the delivery of military 
equipment, the U.S. can protest the 
actions of the Egyptian military, 
without losing the leverage in the 
Middle East that aid provides.
Admittedly, that leverage is tenu-
ous at best. Other nations, including 
Saudi Arabia, have indicated that 
they would supply military aid if the 
U.S. suspended it, according to CNN. 
But the current agreement with 
Egypt is long standing and dates 
back to the Camp David Accords, 
peace talks between Israel and 
Egypt that the U.S. hosted in 1978. 
This historical precedent does not 
mean that the U.S. has to aid Egypt, 
but it means that the situation in 
the Middle East has a foundation in 
established policies. U.S. condem-
nation of the recent actions of the 
Egyptian military would impact re-
lationships between Middle Eastern 
nations in unpredictable ways. The 
U.S. also receives privileged access 
through military aid to the Suez 
Canal, which is both economically 
important and key for maintaining a 
foothold in the Middle East.
The Egyptian military’s violent 
behavior is unconscionable, and if 
the issue of aid were only a question 
of morality, then the United States 
should withdraw that support. How-
ever, the issue is more complex, and 
involves the stability of an entire re-
gion. The U.S. chose to involve itself 
in an extremely complex situation, 
and that commitment cannot be re-
versed easily. Withdrawing support 
from Egypt would most certainly 
lead to more violence and further 
chaos, but ostensibly maintaining 
that support while undercutting it in 
subtle ways has the potential to cur-
tail the Egyptian military without 
destabilizing the Middle East.

Carnegie Mellon Computing Ser-
vices is of?cially transitioning all un-
dergraduate student email services 
to Google Apps this fall. New stu-
dents received this service on Aug. 
16, while upperclass students will 
transition from the existing Squirrel-
Mail this weekend. The Computing 
Services website states that as part of 
this change students will have email, 
calendar, and document services 
available through Google, in addi-
tion to 30 gigabytes of digital stor-
age. Students will be able to log in 
to this service using their Andrew ID 
and password, and there are numer-
ous scheduled times during which 
Computing Services will be available 
to answer questions.
Moving to Google Apps is an ex-
cellent decision by the university, but 
it must be heavily advertised to the 
student body before the transition 
occurs. Currently, only one email 
about transition support was sent 
to the entire campus community, 
reminding students to empty their 
trash and spam folders to ensure a 
smooth transition.
Many other institutions now use 
Google to host their mail, and many 
Carnegie Mellon students have per-
sonal Gmail addresses and forward 
their Andrew email to these ac-
counts. While the update to Squirrel-
Mail at the beginning of the previous 
school year was a marked improve-
ment, it has become clear that an ap-
plication provider like Google is far 
more effective at providing reliable, 
easy-to-use mail services. Through 
this transition, students also gain the 
use of services such as Google Calen-
dar and Google Docs to collaborate 
and work with others, in addition to 
the extra storage space.
In order to better publicize this 
move, Computing Services must 
make students aware of the in-depth 
documentation it has on its website 
concerning the move. The documen-
tation covers topics like login infor-
mation, mobile device setup, and 
frequently asked questions. This in-
formation, or the link to the website, 
should also be dispersed through 
email and placed in prominent loca-
tions on campus for students to view.
If Computing Services does not 
publicize the move to Google Apps 
well before the transition occurs 
for upperclassmen, students could 
encounter technical problems that 
they are not prepared for. More im-
portantly, they could lose correspon-
dence that they left unattended in 
SquirrelMail. 
The confusion that students may 
encounter once the move occurs 
could be avoided if all students are 
explicitly aware of the changes and 
of all Google programs available.
In an attempt to reach a younger 
audience, LinkedIn recently cre-
ated University Pages — of?cial 
pro?les for universities on LinkedIn. 
Through the website, users will have 
access to a database of 200 univer-
sity pro?les — with more to come 
— on LinkedIn. These pro?les will 
include information about alumni, 
such as where they work and which 
companies recruit them after gradu-
ation. The university will be able to 
post updates, and prospective stu-
dents will have the option to ask 
students, staff, and alumni questions 
about the university.
University Pages is a great aggre-
gator for pooling information about 
alumni, but these pages bring little 
new information that students can 
research online when looking at pro-
spective schools.
Students may be able to 
get college information from a 
well-regarded professional website, 
but this information is often already 
provided on university websites 
or unof?cial channels like College 
Con?dential. LinkedIn does offer 
information about which companies 
alumni are hired by in one location. 
However, the types of companies 
that alumni join is also often found 
through sources like U.S. News & 
World Report and individual col-
lege websites through information 
about popular majors, although 
speci?c company names may not be 
mentioned. Some colleges, such as 
Carnegie Mellon, release lists of top 
employment companies.
Admittedly, University Pages is 
valuable for the connections that 
students can form with members 
of campus communities. The pages 
could provide a hub for students to 
get to know staff and professors on 
campus before visiting. It may not 
help students to connect with other 
students, though, as most students 
already use Facebook groups or cha-
trooms to make these initial connec-
tions if they choose to do so online.
Like any social networking web-
site, LinkedIn will only gain traf?c if 
it has users who determine that the 
website has invaluable content. With 
many websites already established 
that provide similar information, 
LinkedIn may have trouble attract-
ing and, more importantly, keeping 
the younger user base it is trying to 
reach through University Pages.
LinkedIn’s new University Pages 
does a solid job at aggregating infor-
mation about colleges and universi-
ties, but the pages do not provide in-
formation unique enough to attract 
the new users it targets.
The cost of college has skyrocket-
ed over the past few years. According 
to President Barack Obama during a 
speech at the University of Buffalo 
last Thursday, tuition rates at four-
year public colleges have risen by 
more than 250 percent over a span 
of 30 years, and the average student 
graduates with over $26,000 of debt.
In response to the increased cost 
of education, Obama proposed a 
plan during his speech for making 
college more affordable. His three 
goals include creating a new rating 
system for colleges based on oppor-
tunity; getting colleges to provide 
new economical methods for educa-
tion; and making debt more man-
ageable.
While Obama’s goals are admi-
rable, his changes needed more con-
crete explanations during his speech 
to show that the proposed sweeping 
reforms can be implemented with 
ease.
Throughout his speech, Obama 
provided clear goals for providing 
more affordable education and even 
pointed to innovative ideas that 
universities are enacting, including 
Carnegie Mellon's initiative to help 
students master material online at 
lower costs.
With tuition costs of $46,670 for 
incoming students, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s student body that pays a lot for 
its education. Suggestions for lower-
ing this cost for incoming students 
would no doubt be well received.
A more in-depth explanation of 
each goal would have made Obama's 
plans seem more attainable. His plan 
for creating a new rating system was 
also explained broadly, with a tenta-
tive launch date of 2015 for the sys-
tem. However, there was little word 
on the progress for a new rating sys-
tem beyond the appointment of Sec-
retary of Education Arne Duncan to 
lead the initiative. Obama spoke of 
incentives for schools to create new 
ways of learning at a more afford-
able rate, but did not provide specif-
ics on how these incentives would be 
enforced or implemented.
Additionally, Obama spoke about 
advertising an already-existing 
method for paying loans called the 
Pay As You Earn plan to encourage 
students to take advantage of it, but 
offered little more in terms of new 
ways to help students pay loans.
The goals presented in Obama’s 
speech will most likely positively im-
pact students looking toward higher 
education, but only if these goals 
translate into action. 
Without these speci?cally de-
tailed actions, Obama’s speech 
seems premature; it would have 
been more effective if he had dis-
cussed current government action 
toward encouraging schools to be 
innovative when making education 
more affordable.

Panic buttons serve as worthy alternatives to armed educators
WILLIAM PARK
Undergraduates all over the 
world will return from summer jobs, 
research fellowships, and intern-
ships this week. One summer intern, 
however, will not.
Moritz Erhardt, a 21-year-old ?-
nance intern at the London Bank of 
America Merrill Lynch, was found 
dead in his London apartment on 
Aug. 15. The cause of his death is 
currently unknown, but Erhardt re-
portedly worked 72 hours straight 
without sleep, according to Reuters.
Finance internships are as com-
petitive to get as they are demand-
ing. According to The Guardian, a 
fellow intern of Erhardt said that 
interns typically worked 15 hours a 
day. Some interns often voluntarily 
work overtime — working long 
hours, they believe, is the surest way 
to impress their bosses and receive 
a job offer with a starting salary ap-
proaching six ?gures.
No one explicitly told Erhardt 
that he had to abandon three days 
of sleep — but while ?nance interns 
can bene?t from their hard work, 
no one bene?ts more from interns’ 
zealousness and ambitiousness than 
the ?nancial institutions employing 
them. If their interns want to work 
overtime, why stop them?
Such a mentality does little to 
change their greedy reputation. In 
a 2012 poll conducted by the Pew 
Research Center, only 22 percent of 
American respondents had a posi-
tive view on banks.
To many, it isn’t surprising that 
banks would abuse customers or 
take advantage of the law, but to 
take advantage of one’s own work-
ers is going too far. Yet, what will 
they do? Expecting major ?nancial 
institutions to change their treat-
ment of interns out of a moral regret 
would be comical.
Although the indifference of Er-
hardt’s supervisors is certainly de-
plorable, his death ultimately comes 
down to his willingness to work 72 
hours straight.
The most impactful change must 
occur not at the top, but at the bot-
tom. Finance interns may not be 
able to change the exploitative cul-
ture of their chosen ?eld, but they 
can change how willing they are to 
succumb to its pressures. Although 
there is a high-paying job that in-
terns are more or less auditioning 
for, there should be a limit to the 
sacri?ces they are willing to pay for 
their future.
This sentiment is not only appli-
cable to ?nance interns but to many 
young adults. As employers still ?nd 
themselves cash-strapped from the 
global recession, they want to hire 
fewer employees who are versatile 
and want to work more hours. In a 
March article in The New York Times 
titled “The No-Limits Job” on the 
topic of demanding entry-level jobs, 
a media manager said, “We need 
to hire a 22-22-22,” referring to a 
22-year-old willing to work 22 hours 
a day for $22,000 a year.
Thus, many college graduates 
and undergraduates take demand-
ing internships and entry-level jobs 
in the hopes of securing better jobs 
in the future. Lucrative, high-paying 
jobs don’t grow on trees, and while 
working hard is often a requirement 
of securing that goal, there is a limit.
While a distant golden apple 
may justify the sacri?ces interns and 
entry-level employees make, there 
may be — in extreme cases like 
Erhardt’s — no future at all. More-
over, there’s always another golden 
apple — some current unobtainable 
that can be reached with sacri?ces 
made in the present: a higher posi-
tion, a bigger house, or a faster car.
The journey to success is not al-
ways comfortable, but one’s health 
should never be compromised. One 
must be healthy to enjoy the fruits of 
his or her labor.

Cut-throat attitude hurts 
intern health irreparably
BRADEN KELNER
In the aftermath of the tragic 
shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary 
School in Newtown, Conn., many 
American schools increased security. 
According to The Wall Street Journal, 
over 400 schools across the country 
recently installed permanent panic 
buttons behind desks or placed mo-
bile buttons in the hands of school 
administrators. These buttons can 
alert authorities or security compa-
nies, send text messages to staff, or 
sound school alarms in the event of 
an emergency. The West Vine Street 
School in Stonington, Conn. recently 
installed a panic button system that 
will even automatically close doors in 
the school, according to Stonington 
local newspaper The Day.
The need for increased security 
was reaf?rmed last Tuesday, when  
20-year-old Michael Hill entered 
Ronald E. McNair Discovery Learn-
ing Academy in Atlanta, Ga. with 
?rearms. It is likely that he would 
have caused harm had a staff mem-
ber not talked him out of his deadly 
intentions. While panic buttons may 
not offer the same protection as the 
armed guards that many have sug-
gested, these devices are a more eco-
nomically feasible and less controver-
sial form of student protection.
According to The Wall Street Jour-
nal, panic buttons can be installed in 
schools for $300 to $800 each. The 
system placed recently in the West 
Vine Street School, which lies about 
75 miles from Newtown, cost $10,000 
and includes buttons in classrooms, 
according to The Day. In contrast, 
the median pay for an individual 
police of?cer is $55,010 annually, 
the Bureau of Labor Statistics found. 
Based on these costs, hiring armed 
guards may cost school districts over 
$45,000 more than the initial instal-
lation of panic buttons. Hiring more 
than one guard per school dramati-
cally increases that price difference. 
Although there are operating costs 
associated with panic buttons, their 
total cost is much less than the cost of 
hiring armed of?cers. For example, 
panic buttons installed in six schools 
and two administrative buildings in 
Apache Junction, Ariz. will have an 
annual operating cost of only $4,000 
a year on top of their initial cost, ac-
cording to ABC15 Arizona.
The introduction of panic but-
tons may be a welcome alternative 
to armed guards in a country where 
cash-strapped schools are abundant; 
the Center on Budget and Policy 
Priorities found that 37 states pro-
vided less funding for the 2011 –12 
academic year than they did for the 
2010–11 academic year. While guards 
may provide more visible protection 
than panic buttons, many school dis-
tricts may not be able to justify the 
cost of guards compared to the lower 
cost of panic buttons.
The visible presence of armed 
guards may even have detrimental 
effects on students. A study by the 
Youth & Society journal conducted 
in 2011 found that armed guards on 
school premises made some students 
feel less safe. While the presence of 
armed guards on elementary school 
grounds may provide reassurance for 
parents and community members, 
the constant visible reminder of pos-
sible threats may be harmful to some 
students’ psychological well-being, 
whereas the less obtrusive nature of 
panic buttons would help the devices 
go generally unnoticed by students.
Many have suggested that teach-
ers, rather than of?cers, should be 
equipped with ?rearms, but this so-
lution also has problems. A report 
by the School Improvement Network 
conducted in January found that 
about 7,720 of 10,661 teachers — 
72.4 percent — said they would be 
unlikely to bring a ?rearm to school if 
they could. Teachers themselves must 
be comfortable carrying ?rearms if 
they are going to be armed. Even if 
they were comfortable, educators 
would also have to learn how to prop-
erly use these ?rearms and complete 
further training as security measures 
change over time. Some teachers 
have completed training courses that 
lasted as little as six hours, according 
to the Daily Mail. This small amount 
of training will not prepare teachers 
to properly handle their weapons 
during an emergency situation. Panic 
buttons are not dangerous weapons 
and do not require extensive train-
ing, making them a viable solution 
for security this fall. It must also be 
noted that it was a staff member who 
was able to relate to others, and not 
armed personnel, who stopped the 
would-be shooter in Atlanta.
Admittedly, panic buttons may 
not provide the same level of ?rst-
line protection as armed personnel. 
However, they are a relatively uncon-
troversial method of security that can 
be implemented quickly and inex-
pensively to give elementary-school 
educators another defense in their 
arsenal for ensuring child safety.

Recently, Allegheny County dis-
trict attorney Stephen Zappala an-
nounced that Pittsburgh police will 
take refresher training regarding 
when citizens are allowed to video-
tape the force, according to the Pitts-
burgh Post-Gazette. This program 
appears to have been prompted by 
recent incidents in Pittsburgh and 
across the nation regarding police 
of?cers’ responses to citizens video-
taping them in public.
It is unlikely, however, that this 
refresher course alone — without 
any punitive measures for police of-
?cers who stray from the guidelines 
— will solve a problem that is na-
tionwide in scope: Police harassing 
people who have videotaped them.
In a time when everyone has a 
cell phone and an eagerness to docu-
ment every aspect of their lives, it 
is no wonder that recordings of po-
lice encounters have become more 
frequent since the 1990s, when the 
videotaped beating of Rodney King 
stirred riots and national contro-
versy. Although no video has created 
the same level of uproar these days, 
police often react negatively and 
sometimes even forcibly when they 
realize people are taping them.
For instance, Anthony Graber, a 
Maryland Air National Guard staff 
sergeant, put up a video on YouTube 
of an encounter with a state trooper 
in which the trooper cut Graber off 
in an unmarked vehicle and yelled 
at him while holding a gun in plain 
clothes, according to Time magazine. 
In response, the police searched 
Graber’s home, arrested him, and 
charged him with wiretapping. 
There have also been other instances 
where police of?cers have arrested 
or harassed citizens who videotaped 
them.
It is important to note that in 
these cases, the police were recorded 
in a public space, where there is little 
expectation of privacy. If any other 
citizen had been recorded in these 
spaces, it would be very unlikely that 
the person behind the camera would 
have been arrested and charged with 
wiretapping.
There are some instances in 
which there is a legitimate need to 
keep aspects of police work private. 
For instance, in a drug bust against 
a gang, police who are identi?ed can 
become targets of that gang.
However, police are often caught 
on camera in everyday situations 
that have been horribly mishandled. 
For example, in one viral YouTube 
video, a New York Police Depart-
ment of?cer is seen shoving a bi-
cyclist to the ground. The of?cer, 
who claimed the bicyclist collided 
into him, was thrown off the force. 
In these cases, amateur videos can 
serve to check police power.
The harsh police response to 
instances of videotaping serves to 
protect the force’s image. Perhaps 
these responses are done in part to 
minimize hostility toward their re-
spective departments. It makes one 
wonder, then, how truly effective 
a tactic of intimidation and harass-
ment would be to this end. More 
disturbing, however, is the implica-
tion that the police are abusing their 
power as protectors of the public to 
cover their own tracks when they act 
improperly.
In other aspects, videotapes have 
been a boon for law enforcement due 
to their value as evidence in investi-
gations and trials. Video recordings 
have often been used to ?nd law-
breakers, such as the Boston bomber 
from last April.
Police often react apprehensively 
to amateur videos when it is their 
own wrongful actions that have been 
caught on camera. There have been 
some small attempts — from both 
courts and municipal governments 
— to protect the rights of citizens 
videotaping police, but not much 
action has been taken in response. 
The Allegheny County district attor-
ney’s statement may not be enough 
to prevent cases in which police ha-
rass people who tape them, but it is 
a sign that this problem is becoming 
increasingly recognized.

It was announced late 
spring semester 2013 that 
Carnegie Mellon will be de-
veloping the school’s ?rst 
ever women’s golf team for 
the 2013–14 academic year. 
The women’s golf team will 
initially start out as a club 
team, tentatively partici-
pating at the intercollegiate 
level by the 2014–15 sea-
son. Director of athletics 
Susan Bassett is excited for 
the addition of the program 
to Carnegie Mellon’s roster 
of intercollegiate and club 
sports. “Women’s golf is an 
emerging sport within the 
NCAA and Division III and 
we are thrilled to offer ad-
ditional opportunities for 
women to compete at the 
college level,” Bassett said 
in a Carnegie Mellon Ath-
letics press release.
Interim director of ath-
letics, physical education, 
and recreation Josh Centor 
announced on Aug. 12 that 
Ladies Professional Golf As-
sociation (LPGA) veteran 
Missie Berteotti will take 
the position of women’s 
varsity golf head coach, ac-
cording to a Carnegie Mel-
lon Athletics press release. 
Berteotti, a Pittsburgh na-
tive, performed in the LPGA 
for 14 years, was a 1984 
NCAA champion with the 
University of Miami, a two-
time Pennsylvania state 
champion, and is the au-
thor of The Mental Mastery 
Program, an instruction 
manual for golf and life. “I 
am very excited to help de-
velop the ?rst women’s golf 
team at Carnegie Mellon 
University and be af?liated 
with this great university,” 
Berteotti said in a press  
release.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Steelers team evolves, strives for improvement
CARL GLAZER
Staffwriter
Last season was a rough 
one for the Pittsburgh Steelers. 
The team went 8–8 and missed 
the playoffs for the third time 
since quarterback Ben Roeth-
lisberger’s rookie season in 
2004. As expected, the Steelers 
made several off-season moves 
to get the team back to its win-
ning ways. Nearly every posi-
tion on the team experienced 
major changes in an effort to 
improve.
Big Ben is still ?rmly en-
trenched as the starter, but his 
backups have changed quite 
dramatically. Bruce Gradkows-
ki spent the last two seasons 
in Cincinnati backing up Andy 
Dalton. While Gradkowski 
hasn’t started a game since his 
2010 season with the Oakland 
Raiders, he represents a big up-
grade over the combination of 
38-year-old Charlie Batch and 
injury-prone Byron Leftwich. 
The Steelers also drafted Uni-
versity of Oklahoma quarter-
back Landry Jones. With both 
Roethlisberger and Gradkows-
ki in their 30s, the Steelers 
wanted a young quarterback 
to follow the veterans. Hope-
fully Gradkowski and Landry 
don’t see the ?eld this season, 
but with Roethlisberger having 
not started a full season since 
2008, they will likely be called 
on at some point.
Last year, running back 
Rashard Mendenhall was re-
habbing a torn ACL suffered 
during the regular season ?-
nale of the 2011 campaign. 
He missed the ?rst six games 
of the season and was quickly 
injured and out again until No-
vember. By that time, backups 
Isaac Redman and Jonathan 
Dwyer had combined to deliv-
er a solid game even while bat-
tling injuries of their own. Due 
to Mendenhall’s displeasure 
with being replaced, the team 
let him leave in free agency and 
drafted Le’Veon Bell in the sec-
ond round. 
Unfortunately, the Pitts-
burgh running backs have 
been bit by the injury bug 
again, with Redman and Bell 
out. To compensate, the Steel-
ers picked up LaRod Stephens-
Howling to be the third down 
back and traded for former 
Dallas Cowboys ?rst-round 
pick Felix Jones, who had been 
training with the Philadelphia 
Eagles.
The Steelers are currently 
without both their top wide out 
and tight end from last season. 
They lost wide receiver Mike 
Wallace through restricted free 
agency to the Miami Dolphins, 
leaving Emmanuel Sanders 
and Antonio Brown to pick up 
the slack. Plaxico Burress was 
hoping to make a contribu-
tion as the third receiver, but 
a torn rotator cuff has knocked 
him out for at least the season. 
Tight end Heath Miller has 
been injured for most of train-
ing camp but is due to return 
sometime in September. Un-
til then, former Chicago Bear 
starter Matt Spaeth and last 
year’s seventh-round pick Da-
vid Paulson will ?ll in.
The main difference be-
tween this year’s offensive 
line and last season’s is health. 
The same ?ve linemen start-
ing this year would have been 
starters last year if not for in-
jury. Left guard Ramon Foster 
and center Maurkice Pouncey 
were the only healthy starters 
for the majority of last season. 
Second-year right guard Da-
vid DeCastro missed most of 
his rookie season with an in-
jured right knee, second-year 
left tackle Mike Adams missed 
time with an ankle injury, and 
third-year right tackle Marcus 
Gilbert missed time with a se-
vere ankle injury. This group 
of guys should give Big Ben 
the best protection he’s had in 
a while, if they remain healthy.
The defensive line was one 
of the few consistent positions 
for the Steelers, with only nose 
tackle Casey Hampton leaving 
from last year’s main rotation. 
Pittsburgh is counting on Steve 
McLendon to ?ll Hampton’s 
very large shoes. Defensive 
ends Ziggy Hood, Brett Keisel, 
and Cameron Heyward are all 
returning and hoping to build 
on one of the few bright spots 
left from last season.
The Steelers’ lineback-
ing corps has been one of the 
strengths in recent years. Ar-
guably their best outside line-
backer, James Harrison, left 
this off-season after declining 
performance. He signed with 
division rival Cincinnati and is 
trying to revive his career. Oth-
erwise, the Steelers still have a 
great group of linebackers with 
LaMarr Woodley, Larry Foote, 
Lawrence Timmons, and Jason 
Worilds. The only real worry 
for Pittsburgh is keeping these 
veterans healthy since their 
only comprable backup is rook-
ie Jarvis Jones.
Similar to the linebacker 
position, the Steelers didn’t 
lose much in their secondary. 
The main loss was backup safe-
ty Will Allen to the Cowboys. 
Otherwise, Pittsburgh just 
bene?ted from getting starting 
corner Ike Taylor and nickel 
corner Curtis Brown back from 
season-ending injuries. Going 
forward, this position could 
turn from a strength to a weak-
ness with perennial Pro Bowler 
Troy Polamalu nearing the end 
of his career and Taylor turning 
34 next off-season. There isn’t 
much depth at either position, 
but Ryan Mundy was picked up 
from the New York Giants this 
off-season to try and ease the 
transition.
Overall, most of the Steel-
ers’ roster changes are on the 
offensive side of the ball, with 
the defense hoping to bounce 
back after an injury-?lled sea-
son. But the defense is aging 
and each year comes closer 
and closer losing their edge.

Obsidian is dark, depraved
Morbid lyrics characterize electronic musician’s new album
There’s something very sumptuous about death 
and decay when Baths sings about it. Then again, 
everything sung by the electronic musician (real 
name Will Wiesenfeld) in his jaw-dropping falsetto 
is like an aural dessert. On Obsidian, it’s served up 
with existential angst and homoerotic imagery — 
and it’s delicious.
Perhaps “angst” and “imagery” are understatements. 
The first lines of the album, on “Worsening” — a 
track that manages to simultaneously cleanse the 
soul and tear it asunder — are, “Birth was like a fat, 
black tongue/dripping tar and dung and dye/slowly 
into my shivering eyes.” That’s not angst. That’s 
downright macabre.
Also, homoerotic imagery would imply a degree of 
subtlety, of poetic nuance involved in the telling. 
The chorus from one of the most catchy tracks, “No 
Eyes,” goes like this: “And it isn’t a matter of/if you 
need it/But it is only a matter of/come and f*** me.”
Putting the two tracks together, you get “No Past 
Lives”: “Lodged in the rectal wall of agony/hell is our 
only home.” Kinda heavy, right? But Baths somehow 
makes it easy to listen to.
Needless to say, Wiesenfeld grew bold for Obsidian. 
The flowery and nearly indecipherable language of 
his debut studio album, Cerulean — as hauntingly 
beautiful as it was — now seems like it was a wall 
for him to hide behind. Now, his falsetto is unfiltered, 
soaring and gorgeous, but he can do luscious 
soundscapes to accompany it better than ever. 
“Ironworks” and “Worsening” are proof of that.
The downright cruelty and forthrightness in 
some of the tracks can be jarring, especially if you 
listen to Cerulean first; there’s no sign of it there. 
“Incompatible” shows just how acerbic Baths can 
be. He spends the song neglecting and castigating 
his “first boyfriend”: “On nights you roll over and 
introduce yourself/I am elsewhere,” he croons; 
“Fascinating, terrible, you stupid idling mind/I could 
prod your hurt all night.” What a nice guy.
“I was never poetic, and never kind,” he says in 
“Incompatible.” Well, the latter might be true, but his 
masterful lyrics invalidate the first.
Wiesenfeld’s voice breaks away from beauty only a 
couple times, and they make for some of the most 
powerful moments on Obsidian. Near the end of 
“Incompatible,” he filters his voice briefly to sounds 
like he’s screaming, and in “No Past Lives,” he 
actually does scream out the word “lodged,” as if it 
were a war cry. In “Earth Death,” though, he sings at 
nearly full voice, and you can feel that it’s just on the 
cusp of turning into something vile sounding — and 
it’s all the more entrancing for it.
Right around the time he was supposed to start 
making the album, Wiesenfeld got E. coli. According 
to Pitchfork, he spent weeks unable to do anything 
but sleep, go to the bathroom, and play Skyrim. The 
frustration and helplessness he felt during that time 
undoubtedly aided in creating Obsidian’s lyrics and 
soundscape. Perhaps they were even the driving 
force.
Listening to Obsidian is like meeting up with a 
stranger in a park at night and having the best 
sex of your life. It’s dirty, sensual, and incredibly 
frightening. After a while, though, you become 
accustomed to the darkness. You become resigned 
to the fact that your soul is just as unsalvageable as 
everyone else’s, that deep down you really do want 
this. And you transform into a creature of the night.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
It’s the first day of class, 
and I want to make a 
good impression on all 
my friends and these new 
people. How do I prove to 
everyone I became totally 
cool over the summer and 
am not the same dorky 
dweeb I was at the end of 
spring?
Thanks, 
Goals Of This Time 
Approaches: Become 
Excellently Fantastic, 
Require Encores, 
Seriously Hawt
Dear GOTTA BE FRESH,
The best way to show the 
masses you have reinvented 
yourself is to change your 
look in numerous drastic 
ways. If you had hair in the 
spring, shave it all off. Grow 
a beard (even if it’s patchy), 
and if you can make designs 
with it you absolutely should. 
Change up your wardrobe: 
start wearing vests, get new 
shirts with sassy phrases 
or topical or ironic logos 
on them, put on as many 
accessories as your body 
can support, and be sure to 
include a hat. I recommend 
top hats, but the Carnegie 
Mellon go-to is the fedora.
You should not, under any 
circumstances, ignore your 
craving for self-definition 
and instead try to be the 
best person you can be. 
You should not try to hold 
engaging conversations to 
get to know someone better. 
And you should absolutely 
not embrace yourself for 
who you are.
Embrace the quirky side,
Ryan “Definitely Patrick 
Hoskins” Black
Dear “Patrick,”

Dear INVASION OF THE

I can assure you that, 
though the original author 
of this column is no longer

picked it up and will continue 
this great piece of periodical 
advisement for at least a 
while. I cannot promise 
a perfect transition, and I 
cannot promise the same 
quality or type of responses 
Patrick gave, but I will 
attempt to keep the spirit of 
Advice going.
I’m definitely not an alien 
stealing Patrick’s literary

a hostile takeover in the 
coming months. Definitely 
not.
You’ll be the first to go,

Washed Out – Paracosm
When talking about summer music, there’s no better 
place to start than with Ernest Greene, better known by 
his stage name, Washed Out. With his early EPs, High 
Times and Life of Leisure, Greene set himself up as 
chillwave’s poster boy, and four years later, his aesthetic 
remains much the same on this month’s release, 
Paracosm. 
On Paracosm, Greene adds new textures to his already 
layered, reverb-laden sound, with birds chirping in the 
opening track and sounds of laughter and clapping later 
in the album. The album also has a greater focus on 
percussion, a refreshing change from 2011’s Within and 
Without. Standout tracks from the new album include 
“It All Feels Right,” the album’s ?rst single; “All I Know,” 
which spotlights an upbeat positivity that is sometimes 
missing from Greene’s nostalgic sound; and “Paracosm,” 
a swirling track that makes it easy to forget the world 
around you. 
Although he doesn’t push any boundaries with this one, 
Greene produced yet another solid summer soundtrack 
that will certainly come in handy when we need a gentle 
reminder that everything will be okay. Rating: 3.5/5
Julia Holter – Loud City Song
Loud City Song is the ?rst album that singer and multi-
instrumentalist Julia Holter recorded primarily in a 
studio with an ensemble of other musicians; most of 
her ?rst two were recorded alone in her bedroom. The 
studio setup worked well for her, as the album shows 
a willingness to experiment with complex sounds, 
textures, and layers that was missing from her last 
release (2012’s Ekstasis). 
It’s hard to pick out the best tracks on this album. 
With swirling buildups that drop quickly to beautiful 
moments of stillness, Loud City Song fades seamlessly 
into the changing tides of daily life. Songs like “Hello 
Stranger” (a beautiful cover of Barbara Lewis’ 1963 R&B 
hit) and “This Is a True Heart” embody a quiet, cabaret 
vibe — while “Maxim’s II” builds into a wild, sinister 
mix of horns, drums, strings, and Holter’s own haunting 
whisper. 
There’s a lot to say about every track on this album, 
and the intricacies of Holter’s work reveal themselves 
only through many close listens. Generally, though, it 
seems that with this release, Holter has created what is 
simultaneously her most interesting and most accessible 
album to date. Rating: 4.5/5
Braids – Flourish // Perish
Montreal-based art pop group Braids took a boldly 
electronic approach this year, and Flourish // Perish 
shows the band ?nding its footing in a new world of 
electronic instrumentation. 
Although there are points on the album where it feels 
empty without the guitars that were so prominent on the 
group’s debut, Native Speaker, the electronic backing 
forces the group to rely on singer Raphaelle Standell-
Preston’s vocals for the main melodies. The singer 
seems to respond well to this challenge, maintaining her 
signature playful vocals throughout the album. Lyrically, 
the songs remain as evocative as ever, and even the 
sillier lyrics — in “Hossak,” Preston sings, “A boy is 
knocking at my window with a slice of pizza and acid in 
his tum tum” — have a poignant dreaminess to them. 
In some ways Braids’s sophomore album doesn’t live up 
to its 2011 debut, but when Braids is at its best on this 
album, it’s at its best ever: The harrowing depth of the 
latter half of the track “Together” and the buildup of the 
closing song “In Kind” reward the listener for waiting 
through the slower sections and show that the group has 
not lost its driving sound. Rating: 4/5
Other notable releases
Zola Jesus – Versions
As the title suggests, all of the songs on this album 
(except one) are new versions of previously released Zola 
Jesus tracks. For this release, Nika Roza Danilova (Zola 
Jesus) — who performed at Carnegie Mellon in April — 
teamed up with a string quartet to rework the tracks, 
and while the strings are an interesting addition, they 
would make more sense on new compositions. 
The one new song on the album, “Fall Back,” 
demonstrates this perfectly: The song is a fantastic 
crescendo of strings and drums that builds up to an 
emotional and moving climax. Danilova’s voice is as 
beautiful and powerful as ever, but many of the songs 
featured here — including “Seekir” and “Vessel” — were 
better the ?rst time around. Rating: 3/5
Edward Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros – Edward 
Sharpe & the Magnetic Zeros
The Los Angeles-based group’s self-titled third EP offers 
little that is new or surprising, but the upbeat folk tunes 
are still nice for a sunny day in Schenley Park. The 
lyrics and love-above-all-else vibes feel shallow at times, 
and nothing on this album lives up to past anthems 
like 2009’s “Home,” but if you need something for the 
background, this’ll do. Rating: 2/5
Julianna Barwick – Nepenthe
Julianna Barwick — who performed at The Underground 
in April 2012 — has created another beautifully layered 
and looped album this year. The singer-songwriter 
expands her scope here, and allows for a wider range of 
emotions to come through on the deeply personal tracks.
Rating: 4/5

Museum visitors travel the Roads of Arabia
Carnegie Museum of Natural History’s newest exhibit explores elusive history of Saudi Arabia
Walking into the Roads of Arabia exhibit at the 
Carnegie Museum of Natural History is like walking 
into a graveyard: There’s a sudden, silencing chill 
that momentarily takes you off guard. Standing at the 
entrance are three solitary stone ?gurines, their human 
faces inscrutable, the light casting their long, eerie 
shadows across the ?oor.
As the description on a far wall explains, these 
6,000-year-old anthropomorphic steles were most likely 
used for religious or burial purposes. Striking as they are, 
the steles comprise only a small part of the rich array 
of rare artifacts used to illustrate the fascinating and 
elusive history of Saudi Arabia.
As it turns out, Roads of Arabia is an apt title for the 
exhibit: Saudi Arabia’s history is mapped out in roads, 
which ?rst transported incense for trade and later carried 
pilgrims journeying to Mecca. Viewers get to brush up 
on their Arabian history (or start from scratch) with an 
introductory video — the most useful, yet most easily 
overlooked, part of the exhibit. Tucked away in a dark, 
hidden room, the video vividly and poetically explains 
the human element behind the artifacts and connects 
the dots between objects and dates that on their own 
can lose their context.
Though every object in the exhibit is stunning in its 
own right, a few stand out for their sheer “wow” factor. 
In a far room of the exhibit stand three larger-than-
life Lihyanite statues with human faces and bodies 
degraded by the elements, somewhat reminiscent of 
classic Egyptian sphinxes. Aside from their size, there’s 
something sublime about being in such close proximity 
to ancient objects.Despite the majesty of the statues, the most 
unquestionably stunning pieces are the tombstones from 
the al-Ma’la cemetery in Mecca. The stones are arranged 
in rows that emulate a graveyard, creating an air of 
hushed solemnity as viewers walk from one stone to the 
other, reading the intricate inscriptions on the markers.
At the end of this short detour, viewers ?nd themselves 
standing before a formidable set of faded purple, silver-
gilded double doors, ?anked by a giant pair of golden 
candlesticks. These massive doors once guarded the 
entrance to the Ka’ba — Arabic for “the cube” — one 
of the most sacred sites in Islam, located in the heart of 
Mecca.
Incredible as they are, these artifacts wouldn’t be 
half as impressive without the wealth of information 
the exhibit provides. Between informational videos 
and labels, Roads of Arabia does an excellent job of 
supplementing the objects on display with rich, 
meaningful context. Viewers quickly learn that this is 
not your typical exhibit of prehistoric tools and stone 
carvings, but rather an exhibit of objects that became 
instrumental in reshaping archaeologists’ understanding 
of the Arab region.
In this way, Roads of Arabia truly takes the road motif 
to heart. From beginning to end, viewers sense they are 
on a journey of sorts; after all, in an exhibit covering a 
region that saw so much travel across history, it makes 
sense for viewers to undergo experiences similar to 
those the exhibit explores — at least on a symbolic level. 
Though not strictly chronological, Roads of Arabia moves 
?uidly through history, enabling viewers to transport 
across time in an enclosed physical space. Visitors to 
Roads of Arabia may not be able to help but feel as if 
they are retracing the footsteps of long-dead Arabians as 
they walk through the exhibit.

Roads of Arabia will be on view at the Carnegie Museum 
of Natural History through Nov. 3.Courtesy of the Carnegie Museum of Natural History, the Smithsonian’s Museums

established by the prophet Muhammad when he conquered Mecca in 630 CE.

6comedy 
pillbox 08.26.13
This year’s Orientation comedy show, presented by 
AB Comedy last Friday, featured two different styles of 
comedy by two accomplished comedians.
The ?rst half of the show featured Josh Rabinowitz. 
Rabinowitz’s career in stand-up comedy began in 
Philadelphia while he was attending the University 
of Pennsylvania; he now lives in New York City. Since 
then he has been named one of Comedy Central’s 2011 
Comics to Watch, and has performed in various comedy 
festivals.
Rabinowitz’s awkwardness and shortcomings drove 
his comedy. He found humor in the sad mediocrity of 
his existence and in his friends’ often trivial problems, 
spiced with occasional forays into absurd topics. 
Rabinowitz was much like a college-age Louis C.K., 
especially when he opened up about his ?aws and 
insecurities.
Rabinowitz led with a story about his own college 
orientation, in which he was constantly one-upped by 
everyone in his group during an icebreaker. Rabinowitz 
then delved further into his personal failings, recounting 
how he forced a scientist into an awkward conversation 
during which he mentioned that he had gone to 
McDonald’s. This statement prompted the scientist to 
respond, “Did you get food there?” 
He talked about how his hairy chest leads girls who 
take off his shirt to look betrayed: “I have the face of 
a 14-year-old and the body of a 58-year-old. I’m like a 
collage of the least sexy moments in a man’s life.”
Rabinowitz also mused on the concept of “coolness”: He 
recalled what was considered cool in elementary school, 
where Lunchables instantly made you friends and Capri 
Sun was the vodka of the playground.
Other highlights of his act included stories of a 
friend who humped a microwaved sandwich bag, of 
generational differences in dating culture, and of men’s 
sexual preferences.
Rabinowitz ended his performance with an epic tale of 
how he prank called his alcoholic hockey-player friend 
and meowed at him while on the toilet, blaming the act 
on another friend of his. After three painstaking months 
of keeping this up, he was discovered because he forgot 
to use a fake name for the Gmail account from which he 
had sent the prank email. 
The second half of the show featured Kevin Barnett, 
another New York City comic. Like Rabinowitz, Barnett 
has appeared in various comedy festivals and ?lms, as 
well as on Comedy Central, MTV, and 
CollegeHumor.com. He also co-hosts a podcast and 
created a viral video sensation called “Homo Thugs.”
Barnett’s style of comedy had more bravado than 
Rabinowitz’s; his humor was more about his wins than 
his losses. Some of his humor revolved around racism 
and the African-American experience. His comedy had 
a faster pace, and consisted of a few long narratives 
interspersed with one-liners that segued into one 
another.
Barnett began with a story from his college years, when 
his friends slipped ecstasy into his drink despite his 
objections. “What kind of a person crumbles drugs into 
another person’s drink? A good friend, that’s who!” 
Barnett exclaimed, recounting how he had a wonderful 
night after taking the drugs.
Barnett then went on to topics such as free time, 
the misuse of slang, and the stupidity of children — 
including stories about stupid kids he had overheard on 
a train, the joys of farting in a little girl’s face, and the 
satisfaction of insulting 10-year-olds on Xbox Live.
Barnett’s jokes about racism included a story about how, 
while shopping for costumes for a costume party, he 
wanted to buy a wolverine costume that unfortunately 
had fake claws with white knuckles. He talked about his 
dream of running through a meadow with long ?owing 
hair “like a white person.”
Barnett also talked about “the n-word” and its power to 
make things more serious when added to the end of a 
sentence. At one point, Barnett asked a white member 
of the audience to use the word in a sentence, which she 
did with a great deal of hesitation.
Racist or homophobic friends comprised another 
common theme in Barnett’s comedy. The highlight of 
Barnett’s performance was his account of one his pranks, 
which left his homophobic friend Brandon believing he 
(Brandon) had performed a sexual act on a man.
Barnett also discussed his romantic life: “Girls think that 
I’m a weirdo creep. I just think it’s more entertaining 
to creep them out and scare them than to have sex 
with them.” He ended his act with a description of his 
ridiculous OkCupid online dating pro?le.
At the end of the show, the audience seemed to favor 
Rabinowitz’s misadventures over Barnett’s comedy. “We 
thought it was really funny,” said ?rst-year saxophone 
performance major Laurel Beatty, who came to the show 
with ?rst-year mechanical engineering major Hope 
Dohner. “I especially liked the ?rst one [Rabinowitz].”
“My favorite story was the ‘meow’ one,” Dohner added, 
referring to Rabinowitz’s last story.
Some people seemed uncomfortable with a few of 
Barnett’s race-based jokes. “The ?rst guy [Rabinowitz] 
was really good. The second guy’s jokes seemed a bit 
racist,” said ?rst-year Bachelor of Humanities and Arts 
student Marianthie Wank.
Regardless of who was the better comic, the show was 
very much a success, providing a number of light-
hearted laughs after the intensity of House Wars.

gaming
pillbox 08.26.137
It’s been a long summer. Or at least, that’s what people 
have told me. I haven’t really noticed myself, because 
the universe of video games has been expanding at a 
rapid pace. Or maybe it just seems that way because 
every time I look up from the screen, another six hours 
have passed.
With Nintendo’s Year of Luigi in full swing, Microsoft 
still not sure how it wants to present the Xbox One, and 
Sony leaning back in its chair and making all of the right 
moves by not making them, one would think that the 
time leading up to the holiday season would be slow for 
video games. 
But the expected summer doldrum isn’t completely dull. 
A game has stood out from the crowd, something other 
than another sequel or an incredibly easy time waster. It 
tried something new and pushed some boundaries. This 
game is Rogue Legacy for PC, Mac, and Linux.
In most games, one expects to die, at least a few 
times. Given that the current shift in gaming (well, 
of the blockbuster variety) is toward a hand-holding 
approach, this expectation may soon fade away forever. 
But some games still embrace death. They don’t care 
that you will struggle to progress and lose countless 
lives, restart from the same place over and over, and 
inevitably scream to the skies or smash your keyboard in 
frustration.
Rogue Legacy is one of those games. It is hard, 
sometimes brutally so, and unforgiving, but it is a new 
take on an old formula. The game wants you to die. In 
Legacy, you take on the role of a warrior storming a 
castle ?lled with the usual assortment of ghosts, ghouls, 
skeletons, and undead minions.
However, there are a couple of new additions to the 
tried-and-true setup. The ?rst is not a unique idea (in 
fact, more and more games are using this gimmick), but 
it does keep the game fresh. With each entrance of the 
castle, the ?oor plan changes, meaning you never see 
the exact same layout twice. 
The second is that after every death, the warrior dies 
permanently. Players are then taken to a screen where 
they are allowed to pick a descendant to pick up their 
fallen parent’s sword. These descendants all have a 
given genetic abnormality, termed a “trait” by the game: 
gigantism, which doubles the warrior’s strength and 
size; ADHD, which increases the warrior’s speed; or 
colorblindness, which causes the player to see the world 
in shades of gray.
These new features should lead to a fairly enjoyable 
gaming experience. However, the controls are 
imprecise and loose, which — coupled with the already 
unforgiving nature of the game — leads to a frustrating 
expirence, even allowing for enough time to get used to 
the controls. On top of this, the gold you collect in the 
castle — which you need to advance character stats and 
buy weapons, spells, and the like — is stolen from you as 
soon as you enter the castle. This is not a huge deal at 
the beginning, but as you level up and everything gets 
more expensive, this reveals itself as a crippling blow.
This is not to say these features totally ruin the game, 
but it does slow progress to a snail’s pace. More often 
than not, you will either lack good combinations of trait 
and class, or you won’t ?nd your groove — or you just 
won’t get lucky, plain and simple. Rogue Legacy has 
the potential to be a great game, but at a certain point, 
playing the game feels like smashing your head against 
a brick wall. It’s worth playing, but be prepared to punch 
something. This game is old-school hard.

Written by best friends Ben Af?eck and Matt Damon, Good Will Hunting is a ?lm about 
a young Massachusetts Institute of Technology janitor, played by Damon, gifted with 
extraordinary genius yet struggles to ?gure out what kind of person he wants to be. 
While most Hollywood movies about a troubled and misunderstood character fall ?at, 
Good Will Hunting manages to be truly heartfelt and entertaining with magni?cent 
performances. Damon proves himself a real actor in this ?lm, bursting with charisma 
and precocious innocence. Its genuine Bostonian attitude also makes the ?lm 
irresistibly enjoyable.

school through poetry. It’s as powerful as it is uplifting, with a young ensemble of 
actors and a strong yet sentimental storyline. Director Peter Weir exhibits his own style 
that can elicit emotions without being arti?cially effusive in this inspirational ?lm.

pillbox 08.26.13
With the beginning of another season approaching 
fast, you would think that the Pittsburgh Symphony 
Orchestra (PSO) would be rehearsing away at 
Heinz Hall in the coming weeks — but actually, 
these musicians are nowhere near Pittsburgh at the 
moment. In fact, they’re on a different continent.
Music director Manfred Honeck is currently leading 
the orchestra on the European Festivals Tour, 
performing 11 concerts in ?ve countries. The PSO 
has been touring internationally since 1947, and 
it’s this international status that explains some of 
the musical gems of the PSO’s upcoming 2013–14 
season.
Anticipation for this season is especially high 
because of recent ?scal events. According to the 
Pittsburgh Tribune-Review, the PSO’s de?cit nearly 
tripled over the last ?scal year, presenting major 
concerns for the orchestra’s future. But in July, a 
Point Breeze couple donated $1.2 million to fund 
salary increases for PSO musicians, which should 
keep the orchestra a?oat in an economy that is 
increasingly unkind to organizations like the PSO.
As usual, the orchestra will start big this season. 
Last year, superstar pianist Lang Lang opened the 
season with a bang; this year, the Grammy Award-
winning and ever-popular Yo-Yo Ma will start off the 
year with a predictably explosive performance of 
Tchaikovsky on Sept. 27.
Yo-Yo Ma is probably the only household name 
to grace Heinz Hall this season, but the PSO will 
invite plenty of established talent back to its stage, 
along with a few lesser-known rising stars. World-
renowned violinist Joshua Bell, who performed 
Bernstein with the orchestra last April, will return in 
late February to play Lalo’s Symphonie Espagnole. 
And of course, the orchestra never turns down 
an opportunity to showcase its own talent; PSO 
concertmaster and acclaimed violinist Noah Bendix-
Balgley will perform Bruch’s Scottish Fantasy with 
the orchestra in late October.
Soloists aside, the orchestra will also make a few 
gentle forays into experimental programming; every 
once in a while the PSO likes to spice things up by 
presenting a classic piece in an unconventional way. 
Although the orchestra will default to some solid 
orchestral classics like Carmina Burana and Mahler’s 
Symphony No. 9, there are a few more creative 
programs in the series, such as the orchestra’s 
performance of Holst’s The Planets in conjunction 
with a NASA ?lm. This season will also feature 
a new event, the Mozart Festival — a two-week 
program co-presented by the Pittsburgh Chamber 
Music Society and the PSO.
So far, the upcoming season shows promise. The 
PSO rarely disappoints in delivering world-class 
performances and inviting renowned soloists, and 
hopefully this season will be no different.
