Naimark delves into the roles played by
the four horsemen in ethnic cleansing
JAMES WHEATON
Junior Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Carnegie 
Mellon University hosted Nor-
man Naimark, the Robert and 
Florence McDonnell Professor 
of Eastern European Studies at 
Stanford University, to discuss 
his opinions on the de?nitions 
of war and genocide. Titled 
“Horses of the Apocalypse,” 
his lecture addressed various 
brutal acts of murder and ex-
plained why he believed they 
did or did not qualify as geno-
cide.
Norman Naimark is consid-
ered one of the leading experts 
of today when it comes to the 
topic of genocide and ethnic 
cleansing. He was invited to 
Carnegie Mellon as part of the 
series of lectures on war and 
the humanities, an effort by 
Carnegie Mellon to promote 
discussion on the atrocities of 
war and their effects on the 
world today.
To begin his lecture, 
Naimark reminded the 
audience of a striking image, 
one that many have heard of 
before: the four horsemen of 
the apocalypse. Harbingers 
of doom and biblical repre-
sentations of the worst things 
to happen to the human race, 
the four horsemen (War, Con-
quest, Famine, and Death) 
all take part in the cause of 
genocide. Naimark’s main ar-
gument was that where War 
goes, genocide follows near af-
ter. The two are closely linked, 
so closely that it is very rare to 
?nd an example of genocide 
that does not take place dur-
ing a time of war. These four 
horsemen are the embodi-
ment of the greatest fears of 
mankind and, as Naimark 
remarked, even today “the 
four horsemen haunt modern 
man.”
Although the term geno-
cide has only been de?ned 
fairly recently, Naimark said 
that “genocide is not a side 
phenomenon of human 
history, but part and parcel.” 
He reminded the audience of 
Joshua and the battle of Jeri-
cho, where Joshua prevented 
the city of Jericho from being 
built again at the cost of the 
children of the people from 
Jericho, effectively an an-
cient genocide. While we may 
think of genocide being solely 
linked to the twentieth cen-
tury, people have continuously 
attempted to annihilate their 
enemies completely since the 
beginning of time — and, ac-
cording to Naimark, will prob-
ably continue to do so in the 
future.
Naimark next discussed a 
type of genocide that is often 
overlooked in his discussion of 
mass murders based on race, a 
type of violence that Naimark 
has christened “communist 
genocide.” Examples of com-
munist genocide include the 
starvation of the Ukrainians 
by the Soviet regime under 
Josef Stalin, the Cambodian 
genocide led by Pol Pot and 
the Khmer Rouge, and the 
atrocities committed by Mao 
Zedong in his Great Leap For-
ward. As with almost any mass 
killing, applying the title of 
genocide has been met with 
contention among most of 
these examples. Naimark is 
of the opinion that although 
some of these have not been 
recognized, they are genocides 
due to their attempt at exter-
mination of a race of people. 
In the case of the Ukrainian 
genocide, many ignore it be-
cause it wasn’t a direct killing. 
It is harder to pinpoint starva-
tion as an active form of killing 
people, yet it causes death just 
as surely as the gas chambers 
of Auschwitz.
Norman Naimark next 
showed why genocide is often 
found within wars. Perhaps 
the most in?uential part of 
war is that “war habituates 
people to killing.” When acts 
of violence are a part of ones

Memorang educational startup proves helpful as study aid for students in higher education
KRISHNA RAO
Staffwriter
Ask a doctor when he 
or she reached the break-
ing point in life, and chances 
are the response you’ll get is 
“medical school.” Memorizing 
large quantities of information 
can sometimes be an insur-
mountable hurdle for students 
in a number of ?elds. Often 
times, online resources focus 
on teaching elementary topics 
and cannot accommodate the 
learning strategies required 
for higher education. Luck-
ily, some bright minds in the 
online-education sphere are 
working to create innovative 
solutions to this problem.
Carnegie Mellon alumna 
Tria Chang (Professional Writ-
ing & Communication Design, 
2007) currently works as the 
Director of Content at Memo-
rang, an educational startup 
company that focuses on “lev-
eling the playing ?eld” for 
students of higher education. 
Memorang purports to be a 
high-quality educational tool 
that costs less than traditional 
online-learning websites. The 
website promotes open learn-
ing by offering free tools and 
material that are user-gener-
ated, as well as expert-created 
content with a subscription 
plan.
“Students in higher educa-
tion need the most help,” said 
Yermie Cohen, the CEO of the 
San Francisco-based startup. 
Cohen co-founded the com-
pany in 2013, and holds bach-
elor’s degrees in biology and 
mechanical engineering from 
MIT. While in medical school 
at UCLA, Yermie struggled 
with the switch from problem-
solving in college to memo-
rization. He faced the same 
challenge that confronts many 
students at institutions of 
higher learning: study tools 
designed to work for high 
school tests were simply inef-
fective.
Sensing the need for a ser-
vice to ful?ll this niche, he ap-
proached fellow MIT graduate 
George Courtsunis to create 
Memorang. Today, the part-
ners work with Tria, software 
engineers, and a team of con-
tent experts to continuously 
build and update their service. 
Getting to where they are now, 
though, was no walk in the 
park.
Cohen had some words of 
advice for those seeking to 
start their own companies. He 
said that it is crucial for indi-
viduals to “?nd the strength to 
pull through, and to do what 
it takes.” In his case, Cohen 
had to learn to program from 
scratch. “Learning new skills” 
is all part of the process, he 
said.
To say that his efforts have 
been successful would be an 
understatement. Memorang 
has scaled massively in the 
last few years, with paying 
subscribers in sixty countries 
and users having collectively 
answered 30 million ques-
tions. Already, about one in 
three medical students use 
Memorang to study for the 
MCATs, the U.S. Medical Li-
censing Exam (USMLE), and 
board exams.
While many of the students 
are in medical studies, the 
website also caters to other 
types of standardized tests, 
such as the GRE, and is work-
ing towards covering ?elds 
such as ?nance with CPA exam 
prep. The website is even used 
by individuals diagnosed with 
ADHD and learning disabili-
ties, as it uses repetitive teach-
ing styles that solidly anchor 
material in the mind.
The website offers ?ash-
cards and multiple choice 
questions among an array of 
Murphycalls forhealth reform
DEBORAH CHU
Assistant News Editor
This past week at Heinz 
College, U.S. Representa-
tive Tim Murphy of the 
18th congressional dis-
trict of Pennsylvania spoke 
about his recent bill, the 
Helping Families in Mental 
Health Crisis Act of 2015. 
Describing the alarming 
state of mental health is-
sues in America today, 
Murphy demonstrated that 
our current laws are inade-
quate in terms of providing 
a solution.
Currently, Murphy is 
the only practicing mental 
health professional in elect-
ed government and one of 
only a handful in govern-
ment with a background in 
healthcare. He pointed out 
that 60 million Americans 
a year are diagnosed with 
some type of mental illness, 
ranging from very mild and 
transient cases to severe 
disorders like schizophre-
nia, bipolar disorder, and 
major depression. Of the 
approximately 10 million 
people with severe mental 
illness, around four mil-
lion do not get treatment, 
or even recognize that they 
have mental illness.
Emphasizing that se-
vere mental illness is a 
brain disorder and “not an 
attitude,” Murphy spoke 
about misguided views on 
the causes of mental illness 
that were thought to be 
true not too long ago, such 
as blaming schizophrenia 
on the “schizophrenogenic 
mother” or autism on “re-
frigerator parents.” Despite 
the fact that we’ve now re-
alized how baseless these 
claims are through the 
discovery of genetic mark-
ers, Murphy said that “a lot 
of what we’ve been doing 
in the mental health ?eld 
hasn’t really changed much 
for the last century or so.”
To illustrate his point, 
Murphy referred to the 
19th century American 
activist Dorothea Dix. Dix 
sympathized with the bru-
tal treatment and imprison-
ment of numerous mentally 
ill people, and subsequent-
ly created America’s ?rst 
psychiatric hospitals. Ini-
tially serving as places of 
rest where the mentally ill 
could get better, psychi-
atric hospitals “became 
places where we dumped 
people [when] we didn’t 
want to see them,” Murphy 
said. “We’d send people to 
the ‘funny farm,’ the ‘loony 
bin,’ the ‘cuckoo’s nest.’”
As World War II ensued 
and doctors and nurses 
were called away to the 
?ght, psychiatric hospitals 
employed many people 
who had minimal training, 
while becoming more and 
more packed. “Institutions 
that were there perhaps to 
house originally a few hun-
dred, became the homes of 
a few thousand,” Murphy 
said. In the 1960s and 70s, 
after a civil rights move-
ment for mental health, two 
sides emerged. While some 
people believed too much 
money was being spent 
on mental health, others 
fought for patients’ rights, 
recognizing the struggle of 
people who could be easily

This past week it was 
announced that Carnegie 
Mellon University was able 
to settle its 2009 patent in-
fringement lawsuit against 
Marvell Technology Group 
Ltd. and Marvell Semicon-
ductor Inc. As decided from 
this settlement, the inven-
tors, José Moura, a profes-
sor in Carnegie Mellon’s 
Department of Electrical and 
Computer Engineering, and 
Aleksandar Kavcic, a former 
doctoral student of Moura 
and now professor of elec-
trical and computer engi-
neering at the University of 
Hawaii, will receive a large 
portion of the proceeds.
In the early 1990s, Moura 
and Kavcic decided to focus 
their research on the chal-
lenge of magnetic record-
ing devices being pushed 
towards their physical limi-
tations. The pair were able 
to determine the amount 
of data that was being 
contained into very small 
spaces, an important issue 
that arose over the next cou-
ple of years.
The work of Moura and 
Kavcic led to more accu-
racy when determining the 
amount of data being stored 
in small disk drives of com-
puters. This allowed the data 
storage industry to progress 
in recording larger amounts 
of data in continuously 
shrinking domains.
“A key part of Carnegie 
Mellon’s mission is making 
discoveries that have global 
impact,” said Carnegie Mel-
lon President Subra Suresh 
in a university press release. 
“We are pleased to honor the 
work of José and Alek, two 
inventors who provided a 
major step forward in com-
puting technology, at a time 
when computing was trans-
forming our world.”

create a minimum of ?ve 
undergraduate scholarships 
each year. Students receiv-
ing this scholarship will be 
decided upon based on their 
academic success and future 
potential.
This gift adds to the long-
standing support that the 
Posner family has given to 
the University. The Posner 
family is currently repre-
sented by Carnegie Mellon 
University Trustee Anne 
Molloy and her husband 
Henry Posner III. Posner 
expressed his pride in see-
ing the University’s growth 
from what it was during his 
father’s time to the global 
institution it is now.
“Carnegie Mellon is dedi-
cated to attracting a diverse 
cohort of outstanding stu-
dents from around the world 
and all walks of life,” said 
Carnegie Mellon President 
Subra Suresh in a university 
press release. “We thank the 
Posner family for their gen-
erous gift, which will help 
expand access to a CMU edu-
cation for many students, al-
lowing us to create an even 
more diverse student body. 
Their commitment testi?es 
to the importance of this 
mission.”

other studying techniques. 
Users can also import materi-
als from other websites, such 
as Quizlet or StudyBlue. With 
a subscription, the website of-
fers expert-developed learn-
ing tools that are designed 
speci?cally to improve in-
formation retention. Memo-
rang uses a special technique 
called spaced repetition to 
help students concentrate on 
the topics that are challeng-
ing for them. The study time 
is broken up into sessions 
that take into account the de-
manding schedules of many 
students.
The website implements 
learning strategies developed 
by professionals with exper-
tise in a variety of subjects, 
from educational psychology 
to big data analytics and even 
rocket science. Content ex-
perts work to create material 
that has a real impact.
In 2014, Memorang was 
implemented in a study at 
UCLA. A group of 20 students 
who had failed their diag-
nostic medical board exams 
used the service for six to 
eight weeks, and saw remark-
able results. Their scores im-
proved by an entire standard 
deviation, with a passing rate 
of 100 percent.
With initial successes 
among medical and other 
graduate-level students, 
Memorang has plans to ex-
pand even further. Beyond 
helping students in higher 
learning, Cohen sees the tool 
as something that can be 
used by students of all ages. 
A new version of the ser-
vice, called Memorang 2.0, 
was released this past week-
end and includes games and 
other user-friendly inter-
faces to help students of all 
ages grasp concepts. Cohen 
himself is a true believer in 
the virtues of his creation, 
and uses it himself to study 
for medical exams. After all, 
he said, the goal is “to build 
a tool that works.” Cohen 
added that the purpose of the 
company is to provide help 
that he wishes he had as a 
student.
Memorang has poten-
tial for implementation here 
at Carnegie Mellon. With a 
large graduate student body 
attending the Mellon College 
of Science, Carnegie Mellon 
?ts Memorang’s target demo-
graphic. The service can help 
a great number of students 
study for those all-important 
standardized exams, wheth-
er for medical school or other 
higher education programs. 
As a tool designed speci?cally 
for students of higher educa-
tion, Memorang may very 
soon become a commonly 
used name on campus.
Memorang offers study assistance
everyday life, it is harder to 
discern acts of war and acts 
of genocide. From a modern 
perspective, it is common for 
people to study history and 
ask “how could people com-
mit these atrocities?” Naimark 
argued that if we examine the 
context of violence and hate 
often surrounding these geno-
cides, it becomes clear that 
people were desensitized to 
killing and hatred.
In conclusion, Naimark 
asked the audience to consider 
the future. The study of history 
is pointless if we do not learn 
from its lessons, and the les-
sons we learn from genocides 
are the most important of all. 
He posed a question to the 
audience: “Has mankind been 
cleansed by our tribulation?” 
The circumstances sur-
rounding genocide have not 
left us. After every one of 
these incidents, the world 
has been poised to say “never 
again,” yet these horrors con-
tinue to occur. Naimark left 
the audience with a somewhat 
ominous message: “The horse-
men have not been satiated, 
and they continue to threaten 
the Earth.”
Naimark is an expert in the 
study of genocide and war, 
and has written several books 
on the topics such as Stalin’s 
Genocides, and Fires Of Ha-
tred: Ethnic Cleansing In 20th 
Century Europe.
(CIT ‘06). “He always tried to 
say yes, and lived very deliber-
ately,” Ca?ero said.
At Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, Giessler majored in me-
chanical engineering and was 
highly involved in math and 
the sciences. His older sister, 
Kristen Giessler, served as his 
Orientation Counselor in his 
freshman year at the Universi-
ty, an experience on which she 
re?ected with fond memories. 
Upon graduation, he moved 
back to Massachusetts, where 
his inextinguishable excite-
ment for education led him to 
become a high school engineer-
ing teacher. Giessler believed 
that, “there is no greater deter-
minant of one’s quality of life 
than their education,” which 
is quoted on the banner of the 
foundation’s website. Through 
this belief and his contagious 
enthusiasm, he was able to 
impact his students by encour-
aging them to explore beyond 
the walls of the classroom and 
develop their own unique edu-
cational interests. The idea for 
the Kurt Giessler Foundation 
?rst arose when in 2010, Kurt 
learned that his chronic lung 
rejection had resurfaced and 
that there were no alterna-
tive solutions to cure him. The 
Foundation was launched with 
the support of Giessler’s sis-
ter, Kristen Giessler, and their 
parents after his passing. The 
website clearly de?nes Kurt’s 
mission as aiming to “sup-
port youth in generating and 
achieving long term ventures 
by providing the resources 
necessary to reach those goals 
and creating a reward system 
that acknowledges those who 
succeed.” With the support 
of friends, family, and other 
individuals who believe in 
Giessler’s cause, the organiza-
tion is “strictly run by volun-
teers, seasoned professionals, 
and educated young adults,” 
as stated on the website.
Alex Hanna (CIT ‘10), or-
ganizer of the Deloitte cam-
paign which raised thousands 
of dollars for the foundation, 
and Ca?ero are two individu-
als who were a part of the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
community and whose lives 
were touched by the in?uence 
of Giessler. Giessler was just 
a few years older than Hanna 
and had just graduated with 
his mechanical engineering 
degree when she began school 
in Pittsburgh. She ?rst got in-
volved with the Kurt Giessler 
Foundation a few years back 
when she participated as a con-
tributor in an annual fundrais-
ing event hosted by Phi Kappa 
Theta alumni. Since then, she 
has coordinated donations to 
help raise money for the foun-
dation as well as contributing 
to the grant selection process 
for prospective recipients.
 Hanna remembers Kurt as 
someone who, “carried a sense 
of charisma that made you feel 
as if you were the only person 
in the room when talking to 
him. I’ll never forget his eternal 
optimism. No matter the situa-
tion, his calming presence and 
soothing smirk always let me 
know that it would be alright,” 
Hanna said.
Ca?ero describes Giessler 
as “a man of principle with 
seemingly in?nite patience and 
a quick sense of humor.” Ca?e-
ro also contributes to the foun-
dation through fundraising 
efforts from the west coast. 
He described the annual event 
as an opportunity that allows 
anyone who knew Giessler and 
other Carnegie Mellon alumni 
to, “spend time together … and 
laugh and talk about Kurt as if 
he were among us.”
Grant recipients are cho-
sen through the foundation’s 
application process, for which 
they have to answer two ques-
tions: “How will this initiative 
bene?t you as an individual?” 
and “How will this initiative 
bene?t society?” 
Students who are se-
lected can receive upwards 
of $2000 in grant money for 
their respective projects. The 
grants allow the foundation to 
achieve Kurt’s purpose for cre-
ating it in the ?rst place, which 
is to, in his own words, “chal-
lenge the youth of tomorrow, 
to fund their projects, and to 
reward them for success.”
For example, Kevin John-
son was an 18 year old when 
he was selected in 2015 for his 
idea to develop an advanced 
wireless theatrical light con-
trol system called LightMate, 
for which he received a $2,100 
grant. When his application 
was selected by the founda-
tion, he had created proto-
types to prove that his idea 
was plausible, and had already 
evaluated what he could do to 
continue developing his proj-
ect. Katie Curran is another 
example of a student who was 
awarded $1,000 as a part of the 
foundation’s Prize for Achieve-
ment for her accomplishments 
with Project Next Generation. 
According to the website, the 
award is meant to “recognize 
individuals who are already 
making an impact on their 
community.” Curran’s Project 
Next Generation is a volunteer 
and leadership education orga-
nization that was created with 
the intention of, “[inspiring] 
the rising generation of young 
leaders to be actively involved 
in their community,” as stated 
in her nomination letter.
There are a number of 
different ways that we can 
continue Kurt Giessler’s legacy 
on the Carnegie Mellon cam-
pus. The foundation is con-
stantly looking for quali?ed 
applicants. Members of the 
Carnegie Mellon University 
community can reach out to lo-
cal Pittsburgh high schools that 
may need funding for engi-
neering or robotics programs, 
or refer prospective applicants 
to members of the founda-
tion. Anything, even simple 
contributions in the form of 
small donations, can be help-
ful to remembering Giessler 
and supporting the cause that 
he held so dear to his heart. To

Norman Naimark invited a group of Carnegie Mellon students to think about how war, conquest, famine, and death play a role in genocide in history.
WAR, from A1
Norman Naimark shares his thoughts on genocide and the Four Horsemen
put away by relatives signing a 
form and were held captive in 
psychiatric institutions where 
abuse and neglect were ram-
pant. Eventually, in the 1980s 
and 90s, many mental institu-
tions were closed in response 
to both sides.
In part, the development 
of medications and psycho-
therapy did effectively treat 
some people and reduce the 
number of those who needed 
psychiatric help. However, 
another aspect of the decline 
of psychiatric hospitals was 
the subsequent increase in 
prisons. As more people were 
let out of mental institutions, 
some with severe disorders 
committed crimes. Some, 
who couldn’t take care of 
themselves, became home-
less. And some were sent to 
the emergency room where, 
if there wasn’t enough space 
and they were too problem-
atic, they were chemically 
sedated and fully strapped 
to a gurney, referred to as a 
“?ve point tie down.” All of 
these situations still happen 
today. Murphy said, “I look 
upon that and say, ‘What are 
we doing? Have we really ad-
vanced since the 1800s?’ And 
I believe we have not.”
“We’ve replaced the hos-
pital bed with the prison 
cell, the blanket on the sub-
way grate, the emergency 
room, and lastly, the county 
morgue,” Murphy said. The 
scale of mental illness-related 
deaths in America is “stagger-
ing,” as described by Murphy. 
Last year, there were 41,000 
suicide deaths and 1.2 mil-
lion attempts serious enough 
to require medical attention. 
45,000 deaths were from 
drug overdoses, with many 
more near misses, and in Los 
Angeles, it’s estimated that 
one homeless person dies ev-
ery day.
“A person with severe 
mental illness tends to die 
10 to 25 years sooner than 
the rest of the population,” 
Murphy said, possibly due to 
medical complications that 
arise when those who need 
treatment don’t receive it. 
Though we don’t know the 
exact number of mental-ill-
ness related deaths, Murphy 
said that even the most con-
servative estimate of 85,000 
mental illness-related deaths 
exceeds the total number of 
combat deaths in the Korean 
and Vietnam wars combined. 
Murphy pointed out that in 
any other case, for example, 
“if the ?u swept through the 
country and caused 85,000 
deaths” we would all be 
greatly concerned.
Murphy’s bill, the Help-
ing Families in Mental 
Health Crisis Act of 2015, 
focuses on breaking down 
barriers that prevent those 
with mental illness from 
receiving treatment. 
A federal investigation ini-
tiated after the tragic shoot-
ing incident at Sandy Hook 
Elementary School found 
numerous ?aws in our cur-
rent system in dealing with 
mental health. Some notable 
aspects of the bill deal with 
modifying privacy rules for 
physicians that prevent fam-
ily members from helping 
their loved ones, increasing 
the number of psychiatric 
beds nationwide (currently 
short by 100,000), increasing 
the mental health workforce, 
and refocusing mental health 
related programs. “We have 
to change and transform how 
this country is dealing with 
mental illness,” Murphy said.
To those who are 
concerned about the mon-
etary cost imposed by the bill, 
Murphy responds that the 
cost of not doing anything is 
“85,000 lives. How much of 
a price do you put on each of 
those lives?” As for concerns 
about patient’s rights being 
affected by the bill, Murphy 
believes that a patient’s right 
to get well outweighs their 
right to stay sick. Referring 
to the tragedy at Sandy Hook 
that was committed by Adam 
Lanza, a man plagued with 
signi?cant mental health is-
sues according to a state in-
vestigation, Murphy said, 
“Those children at Sandy 
Hook Elementary School had 
the right to make it through 
?rst grade.”

Campaign failure puts large exclamation point on Jeb’s lack of appeal to electorateZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
Generally, both Democrats 
and Republicans tend to be 
in favor of free trade to an 
extent, but multiple people 
are vying for the opportu-
nity to be the most staunchly 
protectionist president since 
Herbert Hoover. Free trade 
has become an increasingly 
divisive issue since the North 
American Free Trade Agree-
ment (NAFTA) removed trade 
barriers between the United 
States, Canada, and Mexico. 
Trade has become a ?ash 
point once again over the past 
year. Two of our federal trade 
agreements, the Trans-Paci?c 
Partnership (TPP) — a trade 
pact which removes many 
trade barriers between Pa-
ci?c Rim nations — and the 
Export-Import (Ex-Im) Bank 
— a federal agency designed 
to give out loans to American 
exporters — have become the 
subject of high-pro?le con-
gressional battles. This is one 
of the clearest wedge issues 
between candidates within 
each party.
Former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton
While Secretary of State, 
Clinton was a champion of 
the TPP, but has since re-
versed her position. She also 
seems to oppose a trade deal 
between the Obama adminis-
tration and Europe. Clinton’s 
stated reason is that the cur-
rency manipulation protec-
tions that were in the TPP 
when she was privy to discus-
sions were absent from the 
newest version of the pact. 
Clinton was away from the 
negotiations for some time, 
and it is quite possible that 
the problems she had with 
the deal were not in the ver-
sion she saw, but it is also pos-
sible she changed her position 
in order to gain union sup-
port. Clinton has a very mixed 
history on free trade. She de-
fended NAFTA and as a sena-
tor she generally voted for 
free trade agreements with 
the notable exception of the 
Central American Free Trade 
Agreement (CAFTA), which 
removed trade barriers with 
countries in Central America 
and granted test data exclu-
sivity to drug companies to 
prevent the creation of gener-
ic medications. When running 
for president in 2008, Clinton 
strongly opposed free trade, 
calling NAFTA a mistake. The 
complications of individual 
free trade deals are probably 
in play and Clinton likely has 
a stance individualized to 
each one. The evidence says 
she opposes large free trade 
deals on a conceptual level, 
but with the right protections 
she thinks they can be okay, 
though Clinton still supports 
smaller deals.
Clinton is less dif?cult to 
gauge on export ?nancing. 
She condemned Republican 
Congress members for failing 
to act on the agency’s expiring 
charter, saying that the jobs 
supported by the Ex-Im Bank 
were at risk.
Senator Bernie Sanders 
(I-VT)
Sanders has long been a 
vocal opponent of not just 
free trade, but trade in gen-
eral. He denounced the Clin-
ton era Permanent Normal 
Trade Relations (PNTR) with 
China as shipping jobs over to 
a country with lax labor laws 
and hurting the US economy. 
He had similar concerns with 
NAFTA and many other free 
trade deals. Sanders thinks all 
free trade deals are designed 
to bene?t corporate America 
at the expense of American 
workers and give corpora-
tions leverage to simply ?nd 
a new country to operate in 
if the labor costs get too high. 
He thinks that globalization 
nulli?es American labor laws.
 Sanders also was the only 
non-Republican to oppose 
the renewal of the charter of 
the Ex-Im Bank, calling it an 
“outrageous example of cor-
porate welfare.” He believes 
the bank’s claim that it helps 
small business is untrue.
Retired Neurosurgeon Ben 
Carson
In his book in 2012, Ben 
Carson said heavy tariffs on 
assembled goods would help 
America’s trade imbalance. 
However, Carson has said 
that he supports free trade, 
although he thinks it should 
go through Congress given 
the complexities.
Carson also believes that 
the Ex-Im Bank is a counter-
productive government inter-
vention into the free market.
Senator Ted Cruz (R-TX)
Cruz supports free trade, 
but believes that Congress 
should be able to vet free 
trade agreements. He refused 
to pass the Trade Promotion 
Authority (TPA), which fast 
tracked the president’s abil-
ity to pass the TPP unless 
Republican party leadership 
committed to letting the Ex-
Im Bank’s charter expire. The 
TPA was likely a rebuke of 
Obama and not free trade.
Ohio Governor John Kasich
Kasich generally sup-
ports free trade, but believes 
there ought be certain limits. 
His primary issue is that oc-
casionally free trade agree-
ments will allow countries to 
violate international law and 
the court challenges take two 
years while American workers 
are out of a job. He also plans 
to focus on currency ma-
nipulation, intellectual prop-
erty, and cyber-attacks when 
making deals.
Kasich claimed to support 
the TPP in a Republican de-
bate. However, he has been 
one of the more vocal op-
ponents of the Ex-Im Bank, 
saying it is unnecessary cor-
porate welfare that simply 
exists to fund risky, ventures 
the market has deemed likely 
to fail.
Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL)
Rubio has openly support-
ed free trade in the past on 
the basis that U.S. companies 
get access to larger markets 
by selling to foreign popula-
tions. He also has a consistent 
record of voting for free trade 
deals with other countries 
such as Panama, Colombia, 
and South Korea. Rubio has 
also supported the TPP on the 
grounds that it will help the 
United States strategically in 
Asia as well as economically, 
despite the political peril of 
siding with President Obama 
as a Republican.
Reality Show Host Donald 
Trump
Trump has been a vicious 
critic of free trade. In many 
Republican debates, Trump 
has said free trade deals have 
eroded American jobs. In his 
2011 book, Time to Get Tough, 
Trump said 15 percent tar-
iffs should be imposed on all 
imported goods and called 
the South Korean Free Trade 
Agreement “embarrassing.” 
He wants to impose heavy 
tariffs on goods from Mexico 
and China in particular, say-
ing he was not opposed to a 
tariff as high as 45 percent. 
More speci?cally, he has pro-
posed a 35 percent tariff on 
cars from Mexico and using 
international law to beat back 
China’s tariffs on American 
goods and export subsidies. 
Trump said the tariffs on Mex-
ico would reduce the trade 
de?cit with Mexico and force 
them into building his wall 
along the Mexican border in 
Thursday’s Republican Town 
Hall on CNN.
Trump has said the United 
States needs “fair trade” and 
is a staunchly protection-
ist candidate. He often says 
China, Japan, Mexico, and 
Vietnam are beating America 
at trade.
Trump probably feels neg-
atively about the Ex-Im Bank 
given that he believes Chinese 
export ?nancing is illegal.

On the Issues: Candidates split on international trade
RAHEELA AHSAN

Former Florida governor 
Jeb Bush announced that he 
is dropping out of the 2016 
electoral race. The emotional 
announcement came late 
Saturday night after a disap-
pointing placement in South 
Carolina, a state that crucially 
assisted both of the former 
Bush presidents in their elec-
toral victories. This is just one 
of several losses in the early 
determining primaries in 
which businessman Donald 
Trump has continued to lead 
the Republican Party.
After failure to perform 
week after week in the pri-
maries, it is clear that the 
Republican Party is no lon-
ger looking for another Bush 
name. Bush underperformed 
expectations in Iowa, New 
Hampshire, and South Caro-
lina, constantly losing to more 
popular names like Senator 
Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Senator 
Marco Rubio (R-FL). Many 
supporters of the Bush cam-
paign were building off the 
legacy of his name from his 
father and brother, George H. 
W. Bush and George W. Bush, 
respectively. Many have ques-
tioned the Bush lineage, with 
concerns about his family’s 
politics present throughout 
his campaign, but Bush has in-
sisted that a campaign “can’t 
be about the past; it can’t be 
about my mom and dad, or 
my brother, who I love. It has 
to be about the ideas I be-
lieve in to move our country 
forward.” But voters’ tastes 
have evolved since the days 
of the last Bush presidency. 
What Republicans want now 
is not what Jeb can give them, 
but rather what Trump is em-
bodying.
The Bush campaign was 
meant to encompass tradi-
tional Republican values that 
other candidates overlooked. 
During his campaign, Bush 
rejected the tactics of Tea 
Partiers who have vocally 
supported a shutdown of the 
federal government. Jeb has 
remained an adamant sup-
porter of a reformed Common 
Core education program and 
has written a 300-page book 
regarding his views on immi-
gration reform. However, as 
the election progressed, it be-
came clear that his campaign 
was largely reliant on ?nan-
cial strength, as opposed to 
actual reforms. Bush translat-
ed his connections as former 
governor into donations from 
longtime supporters, with up 
to $118 million going to his 
Super PAC, Right to Rise USA. 
The campaign called this 
strategy “shock and awe,” but 
did not think that would be 
describing  its massive failure.
Yet, as Bush’s campaign 
proceeded, there was a clear 
failure on his behalf to em-
brace voters. He took only 
2.8 percent of total votes 
in the Iowa caucus, despite 
having outspent his competi-
tors there. Eventually, the 
donations began to diminish, 
and his campaign staff had 
to resort to budget cuts and 
rebranding. Bush’s withdraw-
al now frees up millions of 
dollars to the other Floridian 
running for the GOP nomina-
tion, Rubio, who has ties to 
the same bidders as Bush.
This lack of voter support 
stems largely from Jeb Bush’s 
inability to demonstrate com-
mand and leadership to the 
mass public. As seen through 
many of the GOP debates in 
the past year, Bush has always 
been weaker in attacking his 
fellow opponents, includ-
ing his protégé Marco Rubio. 
He provided long-winded 
answers to simple questions 
during town halls with his 
voter base, and could not give 
concise answers in televised 
debates watched by millions. 
What he lacked in oration, 
however, he made up with be-
ing Donald Trump’s biggest 
critic. Bush would constantly 
critique Trump’s strategies 
and worldview, and assert 
that “our country deserves a 
president for everyone.” Now 
with Bush’s departure from 
the electoral race, there no 
longer stands a contender 
willing to tackle Trump’s bois-
terous politics.
Despite being in tears dur-
ing his concession speech, 
Bush has stated that he will 
continue to ?ght for conserva-
tive ideals.
While the audience was 
also heartbroken over the loss 
of a high pro?le, true rival to 
Donald Trump, it is perhaps 
best that stronger leaders con-
tinue the ?ght to the White 
House.
American presidential race reaches audience in Spain
AMELIA BRITTON
Staffwriter
Spain has no incoming 
prime minister right now, 
even though the last election 
was held in December. Most 
Americans do not know this, 
but Spaniards are well-aware 
of America’s ongoing primary 
elections.
In December’s election, 
two new political parties dis-
turbed the balance that has 
alternated between Spain’s 
conservative Popular Party 
(PP) and liberal Socialist 
Party (PSOE). The center-
right Ciudadanos and far-left 
Podemos parties won enough 
seats each so that no single 
party has an outright major-
ity in the legislature. With-
out a clear majority, any new 
prime minister will have to 
win votes by building a coali-
tion. The leader of PSOE and 
current Prime Minister candi-
date, Pedro Sánchez, is facing 
a March 3 deadline to win an 
absolute majority or March 
5 to win a simple majority. 
If both fail, another general 
election is possible in June.
As a student in Madrid, 
I’ve observed these proceed-
ings with a degree of detach-
ment. After living in Washing-
ton, D.C. last semester, I am 
used to a constant discussion 
about U.S. politics. Here, the 
other American students and 
I can chat about the presiden-
tial election, but on a very dif-
ferent scale. Although Madrid 
is the capital of Spain, it does 
not seem to live-and-breathe 
politics the way D.C. does. 
Still, through talking with 
my host family and casually 
watching the news, I’ve made 
a few observations about the 
Spanish perception of our 
own presidential election.
The Spanish system 
elects parties, not candi-
dates. This may be the most 
noticeable difference to the 
U.S. system—we can elect 
a pro-choice Republican or 
a gun-friendly Democrat, 
whereas Spaniards vote ac-
cording to a strict platform. 
This also means that primary 
elections are unnecessary 
in the Spanish system; it’s 
strange to Spaniards that the 
current round of elections 
will only select a candidate, 
and that the general election 
in November will determine 
the president. Ideologies that 
fall between party lines are 
also unfamiliar to a Spaniard. 
I found myself struggling to 
explain Libertarianism to my 
host family because it would 
probably have its own party 
designation in Spain.
The two new parties are 
an important development 
in Spanish politics. It’s not 
a perfect analogy, but imag-
ine the Green Party winning 
enough seats to restructure 
Congress. (I mean a literal re-
structuring: there have been 
public ?ghts among the party 
leaders over where delegates 
from the new parties will sit 
in the chambers.) A few in-
dividuals may be elected, but 
not enough to form a coali-
tion against Republicans or 
Democrats.
Strange parts of the U.S. 
election reach Spanish me-
dia, and I’ve been interested 
in the presentation of the 
candidates.
On the Democratic side, 
Hillary Clinton is a widely-
recognized ?gure. She has 
been involved in interna-
tional politics since her days 
as First Lady—longer than 
many Americans realize. If 
people know who Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I–VT) is at 
all, they usually consider him 
a respectable, long shot. It is 
worth noting that socialism 
does not carry the same stig-
ma in Europe as it does in the 
United States; Spain’s socialist 
party is considered the main-
stream-left, while the new 
Podemos party is considered 
much more radical.
Opinions seem mixed to-
ward the Republican candi-
dates. Some candidates like 
Ohio Governor John Kasich 
and New Jersey Governor 
Chris Christie are unknown. 
Others, like former Florida 
governor Jeb Bush, are rec-
ognized if mentioned, but not 
actually addressed. Business-
man Donald Trump is larger-
than-life and many Spaniards 
seem incredulous that his 
campaign has taken off at 
all. He is well-known, but I’ve 
heard several Spaniards make 
pointed comments about a 
potential President Trump: 
“he would be the president 
of all Americans,” indicating 
that he wouldn’t be accepting 
enough of his own people.
I’ve been most interested 
in the portrayal of Senator 
Ted Cruz (R-TX) and Sena-
tor Marco Rubio (R-FL). They 
are mentioned together as the 
“Hispanic candidates,” even 
though they are rarely named 
as such in U.S. media. Rubio 
is more widely recognized as 
Cuban American, but Ameri-
can media has made more 
fuss over Cruz’s identity as a 
Canadian than his Cuban her-
itage. Spaniards see Cruz and 
Rubio as an opportunity for a 
Latino president, disregard-
ing the differences between 
political af?liations in Latino 
subgroups (for instance, that 
Cubans lean more Repub-
lican, while Mexicans lean 
more Democratic). The politi-
cal distinctions between Cruz 
and Rubio are not discussed.
More than anything, it’s 
striking that Spaniards are 
aware of American primary 
elections at all. The United 
States receives international 
attention in ways we may not 
realize. Presidential candi-
dates—let alone winners—
are mentioned frequently in 
international news, and it’s 
worth considering these per-
ceptions when we vote.

Hillary Clinton able to snag ?rst sizable primary victory
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
Voters in Nevada voiced 
their preferences for the Dem-
ocratic presidential nominee 
on Saturday. While former 
Secretary of State Hillary 
Clinton won with over 50 
percent of the vote, Senator 
Bernie Sanders (I-VT) once 
again had a strong showing 
that continues to challenge 
Clinton for the Democratic 
nomination.
Shortly after 5 p.m., the 
Clinton campaign was able 
to take a sigh of relief for the 
?rst time this primary season. 
After the razor-thin margin of 
victory in Iowa and the con-
siderable loss in New Hamp-
shire, Clinton ?nally came 
away with a sizable mar-
gin of victory over her only 
competitor.
In entrance polling con-
ducted by Edison Research 
and utilized by a variety of 
news outlets, Clinton com-
manded the support of 57 
percent of women and 76 per-
cent of blacks, both critical 
voting blocks for Democrats. 
In a state like South Carolina 
where about 60 percent of 
Democratic voters are black, 
Clinton’s efforts to win their 
support will likely pay off.
Meanwhile, Sanders de-
clared in his concession 
speech that he was proud to 
have come so close to victory 
after being behind by more 
than 25 points a month ago. 
In entrance polling, 53 per-
cent of Hispanics indicated 
support for Sanders, suggest-
ing that the senator may yet 
appeal to diverse voting pop-
ulations that so far still seem 
to favor Clinton. CNN exit 
polls indicated that Sanders 
won the hearts of 83 percent 
of millennials, continuing 
to show his strength among 
young voters looking to buck 
the current system. With an-
other moral victory in hand, 
Sanders is looking forward 
to Super Tuesday, when he 
hopes to capture many del-
egates when the 12 states that 
vote on March 1 make their 
choices.
With this Tuesday’s pri-
mary in South Carolina likely 
to be a large margin of victory 
for Clinton, Super Tuesday is 
where the Democratic race 
may change dynamically. 
Should Clinton win a strong 
majority of the states and 
delegates, her aura of inevi-
tability may be restored, and 
her path to the Democratic 
nomination would become 
much clearer. Should Sand-
ers turn out the victor in a 
strong minority or perhaps 
a slim majority of the states, 
his insurgent campaign could 
continue to wreak havoc on 
Clinton’s plans. Clinton would 
still be the front-runner, but 
Sanders’ challenge would be-
come more powerful and real 
than just a few early states, 
potentially allowing him to 
continue challenging Clinton 
late into the primary season.
Though the chances of 
a brokered convention for 
the Democrats is minuscule 
compared to the possibility 
that the Republicans cannot 
outright nominate anyone, a 
suf?ciently strong challenge 
from Sanders may force the 
Democrats to continue debat-
ing their choice of nominee 
for quite some time.
Delegates awarded thus far
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staff
South Carolina is the ?rst 
of many states in the GOP 
primary process that awards 
its delegates on a winner take 
all basis and the only state 
that votes before March 15 
allowed to do so. The winner 
gets 29 votes and then the 
winner of each of the seven 
congressional districts gets 
three delegates for a total of 
50 delegates. Trump managed 
to not only win the state, but 
also each one of the districts, 
giving him a massive delegate 
lead over his competitors rela-
tive to how many have been 
given out. However, with 
many delegates left to go and 
the ?eld winnowing down, 
Trump’s lead is far from safe.
On the Democratic side, 
ignoring superdelegates who 
can change their vote as the 
primary goes on, the candi-
dates are deadlocked. Sand-
ers’ massive victory in New 
Hampshire is counterbal-
anced by its relatively small 
population and Hillary Clin-
ton’s pair of caucus victories.
Very few delegates have 
been allotted thus far and 
there are huge amounts of 
delegates left to be decided. 
On the Republican side, the 
thinning of the ?eld and the 
inclusion of more winner take 
all states can change the del-
egate math very fast, while on 
the Democratic side Sanders 
seems to eat into Clinton’s na-
tionwide polling every day.
This will be a pair of com-
petitive primaries to the end.

South Carolina voted in 
the second Republican Presi-
dential Primary on Saturday, 
turning weeks of speculation 
and polling into a political 
reality. In a scene that would 
have been unimaginable one 
year ago, businessman Don-
ald Trump took his second 
primary victory, while for-
mer Florida governor and 
once front-runner Jeb Bush 
dropped out of the race, al-
lowing Trump to steal the 
spotlight.
Despite giving a diatribe 
against the policies of Presi-
dent George W. Bush dur-
ing the previous Republican 
debate, Trump still managed 
to win South Carolina with a 
comfortable margin of victo-
ry. Evidently, Republicans are 
more open to criticism of the 
former president when the 
words come out of a man who 
completely disregards any 
and all political sensibility. 
Cementing his role as the new 
front-runner, Trump is al-
ready looking ahead past the 
Nevada caucus this Tuesday 
to Super Tuesday on March 1, 
when 12 primary elections oc-
cur. He hopes to build a con-
siderable lead against the rest 
of his Republican rivals.
In the ?ght for second 
place, Senator Ted Cruz (R-
TX) and Senator Marco Rubio 
(R-FL) both had hopes of un-
seating Trump for the victory 
in South Carolina, but they 
instead found themselves in a 
virtual tie for the title of ?rst 
loser. Cruz, the “principled 
conservative” of this elec-
tion, is also looking ahead 
to Super Tuesday, where the 
number of states with more 
conservative populations will 
favor him. Cruz, however, still 
faces voting day controversy. 
Both Trump and Rubio have 
accused Cruz of utilizing dis-
honest robo-calls, echoing the 
charge that Cruz’s campaign 
had lied about retired neuro-
surgeon Ben Carson dropping 
out during the Iowa caucus.
Rubio’s recent string of 
endorsements, including one 
from South Carolina Gover-
nor Nikki Haley, helped him 
recapture the momentum he 
had lost in New Hampshire. 
Despite South Carolina’s pop-
ulation appearing to be easy 
pickings for Cruz, Rubio’s 
strong showing serves as a 
potential sign that Rubio can 
be the man to unite the Re-
publican Party. Although the 
clamor for Rubio to become 
the choice for moderates has 
once again begun, Ohio Gov-
ernor John Kasich remains 
optimistic that he will take on 
that role when the primaries 
happen in less conservative 
states.
For Rubio, the news of Bush 
dropping out on Saturday can 
only help his campaign. Bush 
previously pinned his hopes 
on a strong ?nish in South 
Carolina, where he received 
the endorsement of Sena-
tor Lindsey Graham (R-SC) 
and hoped to receive Haley’s 
seal of approval. He ?nally 
enlisted the help of his presi-
dential brother, but Trump’s 
insistence that the Republi-
cans must acknowledge the 
failures of the Bush admin-
istration if they want to win 
in November seemed to limit 
the effectiveness the former 
president may have otherwise 
had. With the race between 
moderates down to just Rubio 
and Kasich, the establishment 
may yet have a say in this most 
unorthodox of primary elec-
tion seasons.
Carson, despite his last-
place ?nish, remains in the 
race. At this point, he has 
nothing to gain by remain-
ing in the race, having given 
it his all during the summer. 
Perhaps he remains in the 
running just to keep a small 
fraction of voters away from 
Cruz in retaliation for the 
dishonesty his campaign suf-
fered in Iowa.While this may 
amount to nothing, this elec-
tion cycle has proven that 
anything is possible. If there 
is a brokered convention and 
Carson still remains a thorn in 
Cruz’s side, it may prove to be 
a considerable factor should 
the race last that long.

Gravity waves were triggered by black holes colliding
On Sept. 14, the Advanced 
Laser Interferometer Gravi-
tational-Wave Observatory 
(LIGO) sensed a disturbance 
in space-time caused by two 
massive black holes smashing 
together. When black holes 
collide, they merge to form 
a larger black hole, sending 
ripples of gravity waves out. 
The black holes had masses of 
29 and 36 suns, roughly twice 
as massive as the previous re-
cord-holders.
“It’s quite an incredible dis-
covery,” said Vikram Ravi, an 
astrophysicist at the California 
Institute of Technology. Esti-
mates put the black holes’ col-
lision at 1.3 billion light-years 
away, and in order to pinpoint 
the location of the black holes, 
LIGO is partnering with tele-
scopes around the world. At 
0.4 seconds after LIGO’s detec-
tion of the collision, the Fermi 
gamma-ray satellite picked up 
a faint ?ash of gamma radia-
tion. While researchers can’t 
pinpoint exactly where the 
burst came from, the direc-
tion is roughly consistent with 
LIGO’s prediction.
With these estimates, it is 
possible that LIGO has pre-
viously detected more black 
hole collisions.

FDA will start testing food for any possible carcinogen herbicide 
The Food and Drug Ad-
ministration (FDA) will begin 
testing various foods, includ-
ing soybeans, corn, milk, 
and eggs, for exposure to       
glyphosate. 
Glyphosate is the active in-
gredient in several of the most 
widely used herbicides, with 
more than 250 million pounds 
applied to agricultural lands 
in the U.S. annually.
Although it is widely used, 
regulatory agencies have con-
cluded that glyphosate has 
low toxicity, and numerous 
toxicology studies, many of 
which were conducted by in-
dustry as required by the EPA, 
have found that glyphosate is 
relatively harmless, which is 
why there has been no routine 
testing for glyphosate in food 
or people.
However, the World Health 
Organization (WHO) rated 
glyphosate as “probably car-
cinogenic to humans,” in part 
due to ?nding limited evi-
dence from real-world expo-
sures in humans. Although the 
call came in 2014 to strength-
en monitoring of glyphosate, 
new methods from the FDA 
make the process much more 
?nancially feasible.

New data calculate land most sensitive to climate change
According to a new study 
published in the journal 
Nature on Wednesday, re-
searchers have identi?ed re-
gions of the world where veg-
etation has responded most to 
climate change.
The researchers examined 
satellite data from 2000 to 
2013 to see how various eco-
systems responded to monthly 
changes in climate over time. 
They then devised a Vegeta-
tion Sensitivity Index to com-
pare ?uctuations in tempera-
ture, water availability, and 
cloudiness to the health of 
plants in a certain ecosystem. 
Such geology, soil, air, water, 
and living organisms con-
tribute to the world’s stock of 
natural assets, called natural 
capital.
“This approach now en-
ables us to to do is to start to 
identify the most vulnerable 
natural capital stocks provid-
ed by vegetation,” said Kathy 
Willis, the director of science 
at the U.K.’s Royal Botanic 
Gardens, Kew, “and this in 
itself provides an important 
?rst step to highlight regions 
of sensitivity for global food 
security that we obtain from 
plants.”

Theoretical ?ve-dimensional black hole hypothesized
Researchers from the Uni-
versity of Cambridge and 
Queen Mary University of Lon-
don have successfully shown 
how an oddly shaped black 
hole with such amazingly in-
tense gravity could cause Ein-
stein’s general theory of rela-
tivity to break down.
Using supercomputers, the 
researchers simulated how a 
black hole would behave in a 
?ve dimensional world. 
The simulated black hole 
is shaped like a very thin ring, 
giving rise to a series of bulges 
connected by strings, or thin 
lines, that become thinner 
over time. When the rings be-
come too thin, they pinch off 
into miniature black holes, 
similar to how faucet water 
breaks into little droplets be-
fore completely turning off.
Although physicists theo-
rized ring-shaped black holes 
back in 2002, this is the ?rst 
time their dynamics have been 
modeled. If such a black hole 
were to exist, the equations of 
general relativity would break 
down due to the appearance 
of a ‘naked singularity.’ 
The results are published 
in the journal Physical Review 
Letters.

Fallen meteorites with iron buried   in Antarctic ice
New research suggests that  
Antarctic ice could be hiding 
a layer of iron-rich meteorites 
that have fallen to Earth over 
the past few centuries. Few 
space rocks that fall to Earth 
are made of iron, and since 
Antarctica is generally unin-
habited, many of the rocks 
that land have never been ac-
knowledged or recovered.
Based on modeling and 
experimentation, scientists 
now say that the rocks may 
be melting the ice as the sun’s 
natural light heats them, bury-
ing the meteorites deeper in 
the ice. “The study is propos-
ing a hypothesis—these sam-
ples should be there. We just 
have to go and locate them,” 
said Katherine Joy from the 
University of Manchester, a 
co-author of the paper. 
“Every meteorite we ?nd 
tells us something new about 
the Solar System,” Joy said, 
which is why it is very impor-
tant that scientists recover the 
meteorites from the ice—they 
may learn something new 
about how our solar system 
formed or what kind of ele-
ments are present in meteors. 
The research was published in 
Nature Communications.

New images show remnants of ocean on Pluto’s moon
The surface of Charon, 
one of Pluto’s ?ve moons, 
is cracked and fracturing,        
containing deep ridges, val-
leys, and chasms.
The moon may have once 
had a subsurface ocean that 
froze over, as suggested by 
new images from NASA’s New 
Horizons mission. From the 
images, scientists hypothesize 
that the ocean froze over and 
expanded, causing the moon’s 
surface to stretch and fracture 
on a massive scale.
Charon’s outer layer is pri-
marily water ice, which was 
kept warm by the heat provid-
ed by radioactive decay when 
it was younger.Scientists say 
that Charon could have been 
warm enough for the ice to 
melt far below the surface, 
creating a subsurface ocean 
which would have frozen and 
expanded as Charon cooled 
down. This movement could 
have produced the massive 
chasms seen today on Charon.
The images were taken 
with the Long-Range Recon-
naissance Imager (LORRI) on 
New Horizons in July 2015.

When I think about 3-D 
printing technology, most of 
my thoughts revolve around 
printing fancy gadgets. How-
ever, researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon are expanding the ap-
plication of 3-D printing tech-
nology into the realm of pros-
thetics by partnering with 
e-NABLE, a global network 
of passionate volunteers who 
use their 3-D printers, de-
sign skills, and personal time 
to create free 3-D-printed 
prosthetic hands for those in 
need. 
Founded in 2013, the or-
ganization has satis?ed more 
than 1,500 requests for assis-
tive devices, but the number 
of requests is growing beyond 
e-NABLE’s ability. To ease the 
short supply tension, HCII 
professors Jennifer Mankoff 
and Scott Hudson have 
teamed up with e-NABLE on 
a project entitled “Revolu-
tionizing Assistive Devices 
Via Distributed Innovation, 
Fabrication and Re?nement” 
to ?nd ways to make the 
customization, production, 
and distribution of these 
3-D-printed assistive devices 
more ef?cient and effective.
According to the project 
description, “The research 
will focus on three speci?c 
aspects of DIY-AT (do-it-
yourself assistive technolo-
gies): developing algorithms 
that improve how makers 
create computationally cus-
tomizable physical devices; 
creating virtual service teams 
that allow multiple stake-
holders to work together 
smoothly across ability levels 
and geographic distance to 
solve bigger, more complex 
problems; and studying the 
speci?c needs of clinical ex-
pert participation in assistive 
technology creation and pro-
vision, with the hope of revo-
lutionizing the process.”
e-NABLE consists of over 
3,600 members all over the 
world including engineers, 
prosthetists, artists, 3-D 
printing experts, philanthro-
pists, and students. They 
aim at providing free service 
for those who can’t afford a 
professionally made assis-
tive body part. According to 
e-NABLE, a professionally 
made, muscle-actuated hand 
can cost between $6,000 and 
$10,000, with much of the 
cost coming from the mate-
rials and parts alone. But a 
3-D-printed hand assembled 
by e-NABLE volunteers only 
incurs about $20 to $50 in 
material costs for a hand de-
vice and $50 to $150 for one 
arm designs.
e-NABLE also works to de-
sign unique prosthetics for in-
dividual users. For example, 
they created a bow holder 
for a girl born without ?ngers 
that allowed her to play her 
viola. Most e-NABLE hand 
users are children, so the 
prosthetics are often devel-
oped to serve the purpose of 
riding bikes, throwing a ball 
with the dog, swimming, and 
other activities.
e-NABLE works as a most-
ly web-based service; there 
are databases of existing de-
signs and a handful of guide-
lines that make the process 
easy and accessible. Users 
submit requests online with 
a provided guideline and pic-
tures of their body parts that 
needs assistive technology. 
After receiving the request, 
volunteers help select a suit-
able design for each user, 
print, and assemble the 3-D-
printed parts, and send the 
parts to the user.
Since resources are lim-
ited, and 3-D printing usually 
takes a long time, there is still 
much room for improvement. 
“We are trying to change the 
way 3-D modeling happens 
so we can make it easier for 
people who are not highly 
trained while still ensuring 
high quality results,” Mankoff 
said. “We are trying to under-
stand how to make 3-D mod-
eling a process that can more 
easily be driven by requests, 
that supports testability and 
quality control, and that is 
modular.”
The team is working to 
improve their process by in-
corporating a research pa-
per Mankoff published that 
explores three attachment 
techniques of 3-D printing: 
print-over, print-to-af?x, and 
print-through. Researchers 
hope to develop a software 
3-D printing gives ?exible DIY hands to those in need

Several weeks ago Jeremy 
Searock, a Technical Project 
Manager in the Carnegie Mel-
lon Robotics Institute, and 
Sikorsky, an aircraft manufac-
turer, tested their latest inven-
tions in autonomous warfare 
technology. Sikorsky designed 
an Unmanned Air Vehicle, or 
UAV, and Searock designed an 
Unmanned Ground Vehicle, 
or UGV. The test involved ?y-
ing the UAV autonomously 
and deploying the UGV to an 
outdoor test zone, and the 
UGV driving across the test 
zone, which was constructed 
to have obstructions and ve-
hicle impediments. The UGV, 
designed to function autono-
mously, was successfully able 
to drive itself across trails 
and foreign environments 
by avoiding dangerous ob-
structions such as rocks and       
crevices.
The UGV that Searock de-
signed relies on an autono-
mous system embedded in 
the vehicle that performs the 
computational tasks required 
for self-driving. The autono-
mous system begins with 
sensors that can survey the 
nearby environment of the 
UGV. The sensors are able to 
translate the surroundings 
into an input the autonomous 
system can read through the 
use of voxels, which are es-
sentially 3-D computer pixels. 
The voxels, much like regular 
pixels in 2-D computational 
tools, paint a picture of what 
the nearby environment looks 
like for the UGV and get fed 
into a perception system and 
essentially tell the UGV what 
is in the nearby environment. 
The perception system then 
measures the risk level of the 
environment through a soft-
ware algorithm developed 
by Searock and his research 
team, and makes judgments 
on how to physically move 
through the environment. 
“The perception system 
uses risk management to ?g-
ure out which direction to 
follow,” Searock said. If it 
perceives an obstacle or ob-
struction, the perception sys-
tem performs calculations to 
determine the safest way to 
travel, and then executes that 
action through the machinery 
of the vehicle.
The UGV relies on the 
union of both hardware and 
software to accomplish its 
tasks. The algorithms embed-
ded in the software of the 
autonomous system calculate 
the best route to travel on 
based on the conditions of the 
surrounding environment. 
The input from the environ-
ment and the execution of 
actions rely on the electronic 
hardware of the UGV that can 
detect physical stimuli and 
perform mechanical actions 
such as moving and turning, 
respectively. To provide an 
analogy, the software is the 
brain of the UGV, evaluat-
ing risk issues and providing 
instantaneous feedback on 
how to proceed. Similarly, 
the hardware is analogous to 
the limbs of the body, sending 
messages to the brain about 
what it perceives and execut-
ing the commands it receives 
from the brain.
The technologies that 
Searock developed aren’t lim-
ited to just the UGV. The al-
gorithms underlying the UGV 
that allow it to drive are a 
foundation for future autono-
mous vehicles. The National 
Robotics Engineering Center 
(NREC), a subsection within 
the Robotics Institute, contin-
ues to further push the limit of 
autonomous vehicles. Searock 
is currently working to im-
prove the limits of the UGV’s 
driving capacity to drive 
through even more deformed 
and treacherous areas. Addi-
tionally, Searock is hoping to 
eventually develop an autono-
mous boat, capable of navi-
gating and sailing by itself. 
Physical variables that an au-
tonomous boat must consider 
that a ground vehicle does 
not, however, include buoyan-
cy, aquatic animals, capsizing, 
and sinking, among others. 
Accounting for these variables 
requires a different approach 
to the autonomous system 
that Searock and his research 
team have already developed, 
but they can be built on top 
of the groundwork from the 
UGV has already put the proj-
ect in motion.
In addition, these tech-
nologies aren’t limited to just 
warfare applications. Autono-
mous driving is a rising inter-
est in automobile industries, 
and implementing an autono-
mous driving system is a very 
attractive feature to consum-
ers. Some of the obvious is-
sues with such a system are 
risk and safety management. 
However, the technology 
Searock and his team have 
developed are able to combat 
those issues with success.
 Although a pre-deter-
mined test zone is very differ-
ent from the roads and streets 
of reality, Searock’s develop-
ments are an encouraging 
breakthrough for autonomous 
driving and industry, and 
more importantly a break-
through in the ?eld of autono-
mous robotics.
Autonomous vehicle technology will keep soldiers safer on air, land, sea

HOW THINGS WORK
SHARON WU
Staffwriter
Have you ever felt like a 
scene of your life was on re-
peat? Did your surroundings 
feel unusually predictable, 
even though that exact scene 
was nowhere to be found ear-
lier in the script of your life? 
Did it feel surreal or uncanny, 
different from the sense of 
comfort or boredom that the 
feeling of familiarity usually 
evokes?
If so, then you are probably 
one of the 60 to 70 percent of 
people who claimed to have 
experienced déjà vu, a par-
ticular experience that was 
?rst named by Émile Boirac in 
1876. 
With the literal translation 
of “already seen” in French, 
déjà vu is used to describe the 
perception that a current situ-
ation has exactly happened 
before, even though it is actu-
ally being experienced for the 
?rst time. It is an overwhelm-
ing experience that gener-
ally lasts for a ?eeting 10 to 30   
seconds.
According to the website  
howstuffworks.com, scientists 
have been trying to rational-
ize this peculiar phenomenon 
for a long time. Researchers 
believe that understanding 
déjà vu can be helpful in learn-
ing more about how memory 
works.
Studying déjà vu, however, 
poses many challenges. Since 
it tends to occur randomly, 
for short periods of time, data 
on déjà vu events is heavily 
based on a personal accounts. 
Furthermore, people may be 
confused as to when they are 
experiencing déjà vu. Or, if 
taking part in a research study, 
human subjects may say that 
they experienced déjà vu pri-
marily out of the desire to give 
the experimenter the “right” 
answer.
While déjà vu can be an 
elusive topic to study, over 40 
theories have arisen to explain 
it, since the 19th century. One 
theory suggests that déjà vu 
may be a result of a glitch in 
the way our brain processes in-
formation into short and long-
term memories. Researchers 
found that the medial tempo-
ral lobe of our brain plays a 
role in our conscious memory. 
The brain also includes 
the temporal lobe, which in-
cludes the hippocampus and 
the parahippocampal gyrus. 
The hippocampus allows us 
to recall memories, while the 
parahippocampal gyrus con-
tributes to our sense of famil-
iarity, without bringing back a 
particular memory. 
Since incoming informa-
tion travels through multiple 
paths in the brain, sometimes 
the processing centers in our 
brain become out of sync as 
they blend information to-
gether. As a result, our brains 
can confuse a memory being 
experienced as a previous 
memory.
Another theory focuses 
on the state of our divided 
attention. In one study, col-
laborating researchers from 
Duke University and South-
ern Methodist University ask 
students to look at a series of 
photographs of locations on a 
college campus. 
Outside of their conscious 
awareness, the students were 
shown some photos for 10 to 
20 milliseconds each — suf-
?cient time for the brain to 
register the photos. When 
the students saw the photos 
that were quickly ?ashed, the 
majority of the students who 
had never actually been to 
the locations shown felt as 
if they had visited those very                 
locations.
While déjà vu was not repli-
cated in the study, the ?ndings 
suggest that our mind can pick 
up information outside of our 
conscious, leading to seem-
ingly inexplicable feelings of 
familiarity. Hence, this may 
explain why when we enter 
a house for the ?rst time, we 
might feel like we have been 
there before. 
For instance, after walk-
ing in the house, our attention 
might ?rst be drawn toward 
the host greeting and chatting 
with us. During that time, our 
brains are allowing us to un-
consciously process our sur-
roundings. Thus, once we take 
a closer look at our surround-
ings, we may feel an uncanny 
familiarity with the house.
There are also many theo-
ries that look at the role of 
memory in creating déjà vu 
experiences. Some research-
ers believe a familiar fragment 
of your environment can bring 
back memories that lead to 
déjà vu. 
Others suggest that other 
sources of information be-
sides our actual experiences, 
such as books and movies, 
can also lead to déjà vu. Some 
also strongly believe that pre-
cognitive dreams, or dreams 
that predict the future, are 
the cause for many déjà vu            
experiences.
So what factors might in-
crease your chance of getting 
déjà vu? 
It appears that most people 
start having déjà vu at around 
the ages of six to ten. Anytime 
before is probably too early, 
because young children would 
struggle in pointing out un-
usual feelings of familiarity. 
Occurrences of déjà vu peak 
among people between 15 
to 25 years in age, and after-
wards, feelings of déjà vu de-
cline until it disappears once 
people reach their 50s.
While we might associ-
ate older age with increase in 
memory problems, research-
ers suggest that déjà vu might 
be an indicator of a healthy 
mind, as that person is more 
capable of recognizing faulty 
feelings of familiarity. Thus, 
without having déjà vu, older 
people could then be more 
likely to believe that those 
experiences had actually          
happened.
Other studies suggest 
that déjà vu occurs more fre-
quently among people with 
a higher level of income or 
education. People with more 
vivid imaginations or those 
who have better recollections 
of their dreams also appear to 
have more déjà vu experienc-
es. Déjà vu also tends to occur 
during mundane, everyday 
experiences. More exciting 
events are more likely to be re-
membered, and thus, déjà vu 
is less likely to occur.
So while the strangeness 
of déjà vu has made people 
believe it is a sign of past lives 
or parallel universes, the pe-
culiar phenomenon appears 
to be harmless, as it occurs 
frequently within the general 
population. 
While there is no consensus 
on how déjà vu works, with 
further research advances 
we may just be able to unlock 
more secrets on the larger 
picture and learn more about 
how our brains process and 
store memories.
Déjà vu confuses its researchers as much as its experiencers

PUGWASH
THATCHER MONTGOMERY
Contributing Editor
This week’s topic in Pug-
wash is instant grati?cation. 
In today’s world, we’re con-
stantly connected through our 
computers, our phones, and 
even our watches. 
We can talk to people we 
know or strangers across the 
world, or dig into the past and 
a large portion of humanity’s 
knowledge, all at a moment’s 
notice. Is this unfettered ac-
cess allowing us to reach 
greater heights than ever? Or 
is it degrading our attention 
spans and our ability to focus 
on issues that actually matter?
Our meeting started out 
with a short video from Louis 
C.K., a famous comedian. In it, 
he complains that even though 
there’s so many awesome 
things that come from today’s 
technology, no one really ap-
preciates it. People spend all 
their time poking at phones 
and complaining that their 
connection is slow.
However, as one member 
pointed out, Louis C.K. is a 
comedian, not a philosopher. 
While he makes funny jokes, 
he isn’t always the most fac-
tual or insightful person. Tech-
nology has de?nitely improved 
quality of life in so many ways 
for almost everyone in devel-
oped countries, even if people 
do get frustrated over slow in-
ternet connections.
Another point brought up 
throughout the conversation 
was that people distracted 
themselves even before there 
were smartphones or websites 
like Reddit or 9gag. Instead of 
reading comics in the newspa-
per, we now browse cat pic-
tures on Facebook. 
Instead of twiddling our 
thumbs or spinning a pen-
cil, we now spin our phones 
or check them for new mes-
sages. Boredom is becoming               
obsolete.
While you might appreci-
ate the idea of getting rid of 
boredom while waiting for 
the bus, some research shows 
that being bored and allowing 
the mind to wander is an im-
portant aspect of creativity. In 
addition, if relieving boredom 
with smartphones turns into 
having a need to constantly 
use a smartphone, there 
would seem to be a problem.
It could be that constantly 
?ipping from one stimulus to 
another is dulling our ability 
to really drill down and focus 
on a task at hand. We do have 
events like hackathons, which 
show that being able to single-
mindedly focus for long peri-
ods of time isn’t entirely a lost 
art, but can hackathon partici-
pants really be said to repre-
sent society? 
Maybe for some people, 
concentrating isn’t a problem, 
but that might not be true for 
society as a whole. One Pug-
wash member even compared 
instant grati?cation to opium 
use in China, as something 
that could be dulling the edge 
of our entire society without 
us noticing.
While we didn’t have an-
swers on this particular ques-
tion, Pugwash agreed that it 
would be interesting to see 
data on how well the entire 
population can concentrate 
today versus twenty, ?fty, or a 
hundred years ago.
On the other hand, hav-
ing instant access to informa-
tion can make it easier to get 
invested in a project, as small 
problems can be more eas-
ily overcome, allowing you to 
keep working on something 
without getting stuck.
As far as human interac-
tions go, there was a split 
between those who thought 
online interactions and in-
stant messaging were just as 
healthy as in-person interac-
tions, and those who were 
worried that something was 
being lost. Even if something 
is being lost by having con-
versations over the internet, 
was it really worth everything 
that’s being gained? Instead 
of having in-person conversa-
tions end when a fact can’t be 
remembered or agreed upon, 
people can look things up and 
continue. And long-distance 
communications are entirely 
positive, as they’re replacing 
not having any communica-
tions at all.
Finally, Pugwash wondered 
if perhaps the problem with 
instant grati?cation is just 
youths being youths. Younger 
people have always been seen 
as ?ighty or lacking concen-
tration by older generations, 
and time has different values 
at different points in one’s life. 
Every small portion of time 
means more to people when 
they’re young. 
One year as a 20 year old is 
5 percent of your life, whereas 
one year as a 50 year old is 2 
percent. Life is more chaotic as 
well, as we’re uprooted from 
elementary school to middle 
school to high school to col-
lege. Perhaps when people 
settle down and have a longer 
perspective, the instant grati?-
cation will have less of an im-
mediate draw.
Instant grati?cation is a 
large topic that affects us all, 
and Pugwash doesn’t have all 
the answers. 
Whenever you choose to 
browse Reddit, Facebook, or 
the like instead of working on 
that project due next week, 
you’re choosing the instant 
grati?cation of cat pics over 
a long-term goal. Maybe this 
is putting society on a down-
hill slope, or maybe it’s just a 
side-effect of modern life as a      
millennial.
Instant grati?cation may be less-than-gratifying to society

e-NABLE printing provides cheap, versatile prosthetics 
that allows users to import a 
3-D item and click on where 
they want to add an attach-
ment, such as a handle, and 
then let the system do rest of 
the work to make the design 
happen.
In addition, since most 
e-NABLE volunteers need to 
work in teams to perform dif-
ferent tasks, but can’t meet 
physically, building more 
effective teams is crucial to 
improve communication and 
collaboration. 
Another HCII professor, 
Robert Kraut, will lead a sec-
tion of research on “how 
open-source communities 
use information to improve 
processes to the maker com-
munity.”
“The goal is to improve 
the ef?ciency of building a 
customer prosthetic device 
for a particular recipient by 
allowing multiple people to 
contribute different skills in 
measuring, building and ?t-
ting the device, while still pre-
senting a single point of con-
tact for recipients and their 
caregivers,” Kraut said.
Hopefully by 2040, the 
process will become quicker 
and more effective to allow 
more people to bene?t from 
3-D-printed technology. “This 
project is trying to create a ca-
pability to create real-world 
objects that serve real-world 
needs without requiring the 
level of expertise that’s cur-
rently required — making 
it easier to make things that 
matter and that particularly 
help people with disabilities,” 
Mankoff said. The project 
aims not only at making assis-
tive devises, but also aims at 
revolutionizing how comput-
ers can better serve humanity. 
“For now it’s prosthetics, but 
I hope that eventually we can 
move beyond that,” Mankoff 
said.

I often hear Bernie Sanders sup-
porters say that the more they ?nd 
out about Bernie, the more they 
like him. So I decided to ?nd out 
more about Sanders and my verdict 
is: I’m not feeling the Bern. While I 
love that Bernie Sanders advocates 
for ideas such as free higher educa-
tion, the fundamental problem with 
Sanders is that he touts himself as a 
leader for revolutionary change, but 
has no such record of revolutionary 
leadership. If Sanders was in any way 
capable of leading a political revolu-
tion, it would have happened over a 
decade ago.
Sanders has been in Congress for 
25 years, has seniority, and is the 
chair of a committee. However, in all 
of his 25 years, he has only passed 
three bills into law, two of them re-
naming post of?ces, according to 
Congress.gov. Clinton is by no means 
a legendary legislator herself, but for 
comparison, in her eight years in the 
Senate, she has also managed to pass 
three bills, and has sponsored bills at 
twice the rate Sanders has.
Despite his passionate advocacy 
for healthcare and ?nancial reform, 
Sanders’ former colleague sena-
tor Barney Frank, one of the main 
authors on the Dodd-Frank ?nan-
cial reform bill, remarked: “I don’t 
personally remember his playing a 
meaningful role in moving either 
health care or ?nancial regulation 
in the direction he favored when we 
were considering them,” according 
to Politico. According to The Wash-
ington Times, Sanders’ website brags 
that he is the “Amendment King,” 
though most of these amendments 
were uncontroversial spending 
changes, and many of his stronger 
amendments were eventually struck 
out later on in the legislative process.
Sanders is more of a lone wolf in-
stead of the leader of a pack. He does 
not seem to reach out to many sena-
tors. He doesn’t know how to build 
bipartisan support for his policies. 
It is telling that despite his 20 years 
in the Senate, not a single colleague 
will come out to endorse him.
Even worse yet, Sanders has no 
plan of how he will accomplish his 
platform. Every time he is asked spe-
ci?cs about how his proposals will be 
implemented, he essentially dodges 
the question by stating that these sys-
tems exist in other countries. What is 
clear is that he most certainly can-
not enact all of them. According to 
estimates by the nonpartisan Cen-
ter for Responsible Federal Budget, 
Sanders’ health care plan alone has a 
shortfall of over $3 trillion. 
His plan to ?nance free college 
tuition with a ?nancial transaction 
tax is ridiculous; governments in the 
past have made very little revenue 
with taxes on ?nancial transactions 
and some have even lost revenue due 
to the losses in capital gains taxes 
that the tax creates, according to 
the Tax Foundation. His super?cial 
understanding of policy is most ap-
parent in a recent Huf?ngton Post 
survey on criminal justice, in which 
Clinton was able to write detailed 
accounts of issues and solutions in 
criminal justice, while Sanders could 
only speak in generalities.
It is undeniable though that 
Sanders currently enjoys a much 
more favorable public image than 
Clinton. Though part of this is due 
to his populist message, part of this 
is also due to the fact that he has only 
recently come into the public eye; he 
has never faced the same degree of 
media scrutiny as other more in?u-
ential ?gures.
And oh, does Clinton come un-
der media scrutiny, especially from 
the left. Clinton’s critics from the left 
seem more to want to vilify her as 
symbol of Democratic establishment 
than provide an objective evaluation 
of her. They say Clinton’s inconsisten-
cies on positions indicate that she is a 
liar and actually center-right when 
in fact, FiveThirtyEight points out 
that Clinton’s voting record shows 
she is as liberal as Elizabeth Warren. 
Meanwhile, they conveniently ignore 
Sanders’ consistent support for the 
gun lobby, his votes to continue fund-
ing the very wars he’s spoken out 
against, or his efforts to kill a 2007 
immigration reform bill because he 
thought it would take jobs away from 
Americans. They bring up Clinton’s 
association with Kissinger but ignore 
Sanders’ admiration for Churchill, an 
open bigot whose imperialist policies 
induced a famine in Southeast Asia 
that killed millions.
There are even claims of a vast 
Clinton media conspiracy: Whenever 
a journalist, politician, or econo-
mist voices support for Clinton or 
criticizes Sanders, there are Sand-
ers supporters who rush in to accuse 
them of being shills bought by the 
establishment. 
While its ties with controversial 
donors are a legitimate point of criti-
cism for the Clinton campaign, these 
conspiracy claims fall apart under 
even an ounce of scrutiny. If the 
Pantsuits Illuminati did exist, one 
wonders why most of the news arti-
cles on Clinton are on her Wall Street 
speeches or her emails.
Those who claim that people who 
support Clinton only do so due for 
money ignore her signi?cant accom-
plishments in public of?ce. As First 
Lady she pursued a health care plan 
which led the way for the Affordable 
Care Act, lobbied for the State Chil-
dren’s Health Insurance Program, 
and created the of?ce for Violence 
Against Women. In the Senate, she 
co-wrote a successfully enacted law 
that better regulated pediatric drug 
testing, fought for funding for 9/11 
aid and services for ?rst responders, 
and expanded federal healthcare for 
national reserve members. As Secre-
tary of State, Clinton maintained a 
College rankings distort purpose of higher education 
On Jan. 19, Mount St. Mary’s 
University’s student newspaper The 
Mountain Echo published an article 
reporting evidence that their Uni-
versity President Simon Newman, 
was attempting to improve the uni-
versity’s retention rates by dismiss-
ing approximately 20 to 25 ?rst-year 
students deemed at risk of dropping 
out early in the academic year before 
they would have a chance to affect 
reported retention rates.
Newman’s plan to improve re-
tention rates reportedly involved a 
survey given to all ?rst-years during 
orientation. Despite being presented 
to the students as a leadership tool 
with “no wrong answers,” devel-
oped to help students “discover more 
about [themselves],” the results of 
the surveys were actually used to 
assess whether a student was at risk 
of dropping out. Newman report-
edly asked Greg Murry, the director 
of Mount St. Mary’s orientation, to 
compile a list of students whose sur-
veys indicated that they were unlike-
ly to ?nish their freshman year. The 
president reportedly told the faculty, 
“This is hard for you because you 
think of the students as cuddly bun-
nies, but you can’t. You just have to 
drown the bunnies … put a Glock to 
their heads.” The Mountain Echo also 
reported an email exchange in which 
Newman said, “My short term goal is 
to have 20 to 25 people leave by the 
25th [of Sep.]. This one thing will 
boost our retention 4 to 5 percent.”
The school board stands behind 
Newman, claiming that while he 
used an “unfortunate metaphor,” his 
plan was taken out of context. New-
man’s proposal was met with marked 
concern, however, from some of the 
university’s faculty, who held that it 
wasn’t possible to accurately deter-
mine who would drop out, and even 
if it was possible, it was unethical 
to use the surveys in this way with-
out notifying the students. Several 
professors and faculty members ac-
tively opposed Newman’s plan, spur-
ring Newman to ?re several faculty 
members including David Rehm, ex-
provost of Mount St. Mary’s, and two 
university professors, one of which 
was The Mountain Echo’s adviser.
This controversy has raised 
concerns over a variety of issues in-
cluding freedom of the press, faculty 
rights, and the in?uence of business 
on academics. The Mountain Echo 
has been severely criticized by the 
board for using leaked emails, which 
the board claims goes against the 
school’s code of conduct. Many are 
also noting that Newman has prior 
experience in business, not higher 
education, and suspect that his busi-
ness principles in?uenced his reten-
tion plan. While this controversy 
has sparked a number of important 
debates, The Tartan is interested in 
what this story has to say about the 
dangers of college rankings.
The events at Mount St. Mary’s 
University are rooted in Newman’s 
desire to increase the college’s rank-
ings; by encouraging students to 
leave early in the semester, the school 
would have lower dropout numbers, 
which would improve their overall 
ranking as an institution. Unfortu-
nately, this manipulation of data is 
far from uncommon. In recent years 
many colleges have revealed similar 
scandals, ranging from falsi?cation 
to mild manipulation. 
Iona College, for example, admit-
ted in 2011 that they had falsi?ed a 
variety of statistics, including test 
scores, freshman retention, and ac-
ceptance rates. It has since been es-
timated that this falsi?cation led to 
a signi?cant increase in the college’s 
overall ranking, putting Iona at 30th 
on U.S. News’ ranking list, one of 
the most prominent college rank-
ing lists in the country. Correct data 
would likely have put the university 
at 50th. Other universities have also 
turned to data manipulation in or-
der to improve their rankings. Bayer 
University was the topic of a similar 
scandal in 2008 when they attempt-
ed to raise their average SAT scores 
by reimbursing admitted students 
who retook the SAT.
This manipulation and falsi?ca-
tion speaks to a larger issue: an over-
dependence on college rankings. 
While college rankings are intended 
to be useful resources for students 
and universities, they are often 
used beyond their intended pur-
pose. Prospective students, parents, 
and universities who wish to make 
side-by-side comparisons between 
multiple schools often use college 
rankings as all-inclusive, concrete 
sources of information instead of the 
partial, and often subjective, source 
of information they really are.
Even if falsi?cation and manipu-
lation of rankings didn’t happen, 
there would still be the subjectiv-
ity inherent in these rankings due 
to the diverse range of schools the 
lists encompass. A school’s multi-
dimensional presence cannot be ac-
curately encompassed by a number. 
Every prospective student is looking 
for something different in a univer-
sity, so the idea of a “number one” 
university is illogical.
Despite the natural individual 
bias of these lists and brazen manip-
ulation of data that occurs, there is 
still a heavy reliance on college rank-
ings. When institutions gain higher 
scores they also reap other bene?ts. 
Better rankings lead to an increase in 
the number of prospective students 
and an increase in alumni dona-
tions. Rankings can also in?uence a 
school’s funding and ability to attract 
prestigious faculty.
This dependence puts pressure 
on schools to boost their rankings 
in order to stay competitive, attract 
students, and fund their programs. 
While some motivation can be 
healthy and push schools to improve 
themselves, an overwhelming reli-
ance on college rankings pressures 
many schools to go to extreme mea-
sures to keep their rankings high in 
order to retain students and funds. 
This focus on rankings draws atten-
tion away from the real goal of high-
er education: providing students 
with the best education possible.
College rankings can be helpful, 
but they need to be used correctly 
and with caution. Prospective stu-
dents, universities, and the general 
public, need to understand the limi-
tations of these resources and real-
ize that they are not all-inclusive, 
de?nitive lists. A decrease in the 
dependence on rankings would al-
low universities to switch their fo-
cus back to the students and away 
from the numbers game that ranking 
promotes.

Everyone wants to feel safe, but 
what actually constitutes a safe space 
is murkier than it seems. According to 
Advocates for Youth, a nonpro?t ad-
vocacy group dedicated to sexuality 
education, it is “a place where anyone 
can relax and be fully self-expressed, 
without fear of being made to feel 
uncomfortable, unwelcome or chal-
lenged on account of biological sex, 
race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, 
gender identity or expression, cul-
tural background, age, or physical or 
mental ability; a place where the rules 
guard each person’s self-respect, dig-
nity and feelings and strongly encour-
age everyone to respect others.” The 
concept sounds great on paper. An 
environment in which everyone can 
just be themselves, and not be scared 
of being judged, of being discrimi-
nated against or harassed. Sounds al-
most utopian. This should be exactly 
what we desire in an educational 
institution, right?
But something went wrong. This 
seemingly innocuous idea has cost 
many careers, led to the imposition 
of unconstitutional speech codes in 
some of our country’s most presti-
gious institutions, and led to books as 
in?uential and important as Virginia 
Woolf’s Mrs. Dalloway and Ovid’s 
Metamorphoses being censored on 
college campuses. In a more per-
sonal incident, it led to the residence 
of Omar Mahmood, a student at the 
University of Michigan, being vandal-
ized for a satirical op-ed published in 
The Michigan Review mocking politi-
cal correctness and trigger warnings. 
The irony of this incident is greatly 
exaggerated by one of the scribbled 
notes left on his doorstep saying 
“everyone hates you you violent 
prick.” The idea of a safe-space has 
turned into a tool for silencing people 
on college campuses.
In an essay from The Atlantic titled 
The Coddling of the American Mind, 
Greg Lukianoff, president and CEO of 
the Foundation for Individual Rights 
in Education (FIRE), and Jonathan 
Haidt, social psychologist and pro-
fessor at the New York University 
Stern School of Business, postulate 
an interesting culprit to explain why 
safe spaces have gone so astray: the 
impulse of vindictive protectiveness 
which creates “a culture in which 
everyone must think twice before 
speaking up, lest they face charges of 
insensitivity, aggression, or worse.” 
This concept relies on the fundamen-
tal misconception that words can, 
perhaps unintentionally, cause emo-
tional harm equivalent in magnitude 
and intensity to physical assault. If we 
base our idea of harm on this frankly 
absurd foundation, we can easily 
understand how striving to create a 
safe-space could lead to some of the 
troubling circumstances described 
above.
The most disturbing part of the 
entire phenomenon is that it is largely 
imposed by the students. Lukianoff 
and Haidt go on to describe and com-
ment on the two major tools used by 
student activists to censor speech and 
ideas on campuses: trigger warnings 
and microaggression. Trigger warn-
ings began as just a courteous gesture 
out of respect for the trauma experi-
enced by victims of sexual assault. 
You put a warning before any content 
that might bring up the trauma, and 
people who need to can avoid the 
content or go in prepared. Sounds 
perfectly reasonable right? And in 
some contexts they are. The prob-
lem is, where do you draw the line? 
A draft guide on trigger warnings 
from Oberlin College tells professors 
“triggers are not only relevant to sex-
ual misconduct, but also to anything 
that might cause trauma. Be aware of 
racism, classism, sexism, heterosex-
ism, cissexism, ableism, and other 
issues of privilege and oppression.” 
This would include most content that 
would ever come up in a humanities 
or social sciences class, which would 
make it dif?cult to teach.
Of course, you could ask, what is 
the harm in giving a bit of warning if 
distressing content is ahead? Noth-
ing, if we had a clear idea of what is 
considered distressing. The problem 
with anything based on subjective 
human experiences, like distress, is 
exactly that: they’re subjective, and 
putting warnings on some things and 
not others can favor on kind of trau-
ma over another. In the end, it boils 
down to whether the trigger is some-
thing you should expect in a given 
scenario. Of course trigger warnings 
preceding graphic material pertinent 
to veterans and victims of sexual as-
sault aren’t being debated. But if you 
enroll in a course on 20th century 
literature, it’s almost impossible for 
you not to expect misogyny, so giving 
a trigger warning before The Great 
Gatsby, as proposed by a student at 
Rutgers University, not only seems re-
dundant, but also unreasonable.
Ultimately, it’s a question of what 
you are trying to accomplish. The 
original intent was to be courteous 
to victims suffering from PTSD. Now, 
however, the intent seems to be to 
forewarn, and make optional, even 
the slightest discomfort that could 
possibly be experienced in a class-
room setting. The impact this could 
have on the quality of education is 
summed up brilliantly in the anec-
dote recounted by Jeannie Suk in The 
New Yorker, in which law students at 
Harvard requested their professors 
not to teach rape law lest it distress 
students.
The concept of a microaggression 
is even more problematic. For those 
of you who aren’t up to date on your 
politically correct terminology (hon-
estly I didn’t know this word existed 
until a week ago), microaggressions 
are small actions or word choices that 
seem on their face to have no mali-
cious intent, but that are thought of 
as a kind of violence nonetheless. 
Yes, you read correctly: microaggres-
sions may seem to have no malicious

“Flowers for Algernon” by David 
Keyes is a fascinating short story. Be-
sides the fact that it is poignant story 
and a great social commentary on 
how everyone, without exclusions, 
deserves the right to live, it also 
brings to light some of the subcon-
scious biases that people have and 
how that in?uences their behavior. 
The protagonist of the book, Char-
lie, is “developmentally disabled” 
man who is mistreated and mocked 
by his family and co-workers. He un-
dergoes an operation to “increase his 
IQ” as a part of a science experiment, 
which has repercussions on his social 
and emotional life.
 I believe the fact that his intellect 
decides how people treat him is of 
special interest. He faces social prej-
udice based on his intellect, which 
acts as grounds for an “intellect 
based social divide.” Unfortunately, 
this divide also exists outside of 
?ction, and even at Carnegie Mellon.
Prejudices refer to baseless be-
liefs that one person might hold 
against another person based on so-
cial class (classism), race (racism), 
sex (sexism), physical attractive-
ness (lookism), or other factors. One 
such factor might be the perceived 
“smartness” of a person by society. It 
is a subtle bias, and may not be ap-
plicable to everyone, but, hypotheti-
cally speaking, intellect can serve as 
a classi?er of sorts. People may not 
belong in the categories that some-
one assigns them, but these external 
categories can still have effects.
Not everyone subconsciously 
types the people around them, but 
I speculate about the possible ex-
istence of an unnoticed bias. The 
most obvious way that people per-
ceive someone else’s intelligence 
is through their IQ, their academic 
or extracurricular achievements, 
and the kinds of things that they 
speak about. Even with those 
characteristics, how do people relate 
that to themselves? Is being smart 
de?ned as a person being able to do 
things the observer cannot do, or is it 
when a person can do things the ob-
server can do, only better? If the for-
mer case is true in college life then, 
broadly speaking, people of very 
different disciplines would consider 
each other to be smarter. If it is the 
latter case, then they would consider 
some of their peers to be smarter 
than they are. Either way, this per-
ception in?uences the social life of 
college students in terms of their 
social circles, their con?dence, and, 
perhaps, even their performance.
What does it mean to be on either 
end of the spectrum? Based on the 
behavior demonstrated by other bi-
ases, being on the lower end of the 
spectrum is de?nitely an unwanted 
thing. In this case, being on the high-
er end may be disadvantageous too. 
It is even possible that a person seen 
by somebody else as smart may not 
be seen as smart by everyone. 
This difference complicates the 
experience and the observation of 
this bias. 
If one considers the social circle 
that a person has, one might even 
question the motives, the sub-
conscious reason behind picking 
those particular people as a part of 
their lives. Can people be divided 
into three categories — ?rst, the 
ones who pick friends “smarter” 
than them, second, those who pick 
friends “less smart” than them, and 
third, those who pick friends in the 
same category as them? If so, then 
what are the motives behind that? 
And what role can a university play 
in avoiding such a separation of in-
tellectual relationships if they do 
exist? In a university like Carnegie 
Mellon, where it is hard to perceive 
someone as not smart, how does this 
bias affect power play in social rela-
tionships? All these questions often 
go unaddressed in our culture, and it 
is time to pull them into focus.
In addition, these perceptions are 
relative to oneself. To some extent 
the way we view ourselves and our 
con?dence affects our perception of 
others’ abilities. The distinction be-
tween low, high and over con?dence 
must play a role in the way we see 
ourselves in relation to others, there-
by affecting our social circles.
This is the crux of this issue. Col-
lege students, especially at Carnegie 
Mellon, are prone to feelings of low 
self-con?dence. The workload and 
the sudden increase in a surround-
ing intellectual level, coupled with 
the feelings of inadequacy at “not 
being the best anymore” make many 
freshmen reevaluate their self-per-
ceived capabilities. 
Here it becomes important to 
look at intellect as a bias, and under-
stand how it affects people and what 
one can do to become more aware of 
it. Since this is a bias that is de?ned 
individually for a person and by a 
person, there is a need to better un-
derstand the social implications of 
this at personal level, which is the 
action that I ask the reader to take.
Effects of intellectual prejudices may pervade college life

Democrat party needs Clinton’s experience
Supreme Court opening offers window to party unity 
EMMETT ELDRED
Last Saturday, Supreme Court 
Justice Antonin Scalia passed 
away unexpectedly in his sleep. 
His last words were unknown, but 
they were probably scathing. Sca-
lia, appointed by Ronald Reagan 
in 1986, was one of the most con-
servative members of the Court 
and its most passionate advocate 
of an originalist reading of the 
Constitution.
His death, like his life, is full 
of political controversy because 
his vacancy throws the ideologi-
cal balance of the court into un-
certainty. Less than an hour after 
news broke of his death, Senate 
Majority Leader Mitch McConnell 
(R-KY) put out a statement saying 
that the Senate would not move 
forward to con?rm any replace-
ment that President Obama nomi-
nates. After years of Republicans 
in the Senate stalling Obama’s ju-
dicial nominees, this is shaping up 
to be the bitter end to years of par-
tisan divide. The ?nal 
showdown.
But I 
want to suggest an alternative 
path. Instead of Republicans and 
Democrats in the Senate throwing 
sand in each other’s eyes over Jus-
tice Scalia’s replacement, instead 
of this being the partisan climax 
to seven years of ideological strife, 
Justice Scalia’s death is an oppor-
tunity for both parties to come to-
gether and nominate a consensus 
candidate to the Supreme Court. 
In so doing, they can signal hope 
that Congress can get something 
done, that the parties can work 
together, that the Constitution is 
bigger than party af?liation.
Both parties have something to 
give, both parties have something 
to gain. That’s a strange and ex-
otic formula called (gasp) “com-
promise.” What Republicans have 
to give is clear: the decades of a 
conservative majority on the court 
are over. They can cry and scream 
like a toddler who just heard the 
words “living constitution” for the 
?rst time, but they can’t beat their 
?sts against the ?oor forever.
What Republicans have to gain 
is a political victory, or at least 
they’ll avoid a political 
nightmare. 
Seven years of obstructionism 
have taken a political toll on the 
Republican party. The party is 
fractured against itself and deeply 
unpopular with the general pub-
lic. The party has a tough election 
year coming up: 24 Republican 
senators are up for reelection com-
pared with just ten Democrats. At 
least ?ve of the Republican seats 
are very vulnerable, and Demo-
crats tend to turn out more during 
a presidential election. If Senate 
Republicans spend the last year of 
President Obama’s administration 
amplifying their obstructionism 
to an unprecedented level, they 
will pay the price electorally: they 
will lose the Senate, and they will 
guarantee another Democratic 
president. And guess what? A 
Democratic President and Demo-
cratic Senate are going to place on 
the Court a justice far more liberal 
than the type of Justice that 
President Obama can hope 
to nominate.
What Democrats 
have to gain is 
clear: a third 
Obama nominee to the Court and 
the ?rst liberal majority on the 
Court in decades. We are one jus-
tice away from a sensible liberal 
majority on the Supreme Court. 
We are one justice away from 
overturning Citizens United. We 
are one justice away from end-
ing the death penalty. We are one 
justice away from remembering 
that the phrase “well-regulated 
militia” is written in the Second 
Amendment.
What Democrats have to give 
is hope of replacing Antonin Sca-
lia with a justice who makes Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg look like Ronald 
Reagan. It’s not going happen. 
Instead, Democrats have to stand 
behind a consensus candidate, a 
moderate who won’t throw the 
balance of the Court wildly to the 
left, but will instead bring it into 
equilibrium, with four conserva-
tives and four liberals on either 
side. That is true balance, and 
President Obama is in a position 
to make it reality.
If you’re anything like me, 
you’re tired of a dysfunctional 
Congress. 
As college 
students, we’re in our late teens 
and early twenties. Harsh parti-
san division is the only thing most 
of us have ever seen since we’ve 
started paying attention to poli-
tics. Republicans have to act like 
adults and come to the table, rath-
er than shooting spitballs at the 
table from the corner. Democrats 
have to make room at the table 
and be willing to put seven years of 
Republican spitballs behind them. 
Congress has a choice to make 
over the next eleven months. Will 
Antonin Scalia’s death be a turn-
ing point for the worse or for the 
better? The cynic in me tells me 
that it will be for the worst, but 
the optimist in me is still holding 
out hope beyond hope that there’s 
such a thing as bipartisanship.
Justice Scalia loved the Consti-
tution. He spent his life defending 
his skewed perception of it. The 
Constitution is clear about what 
happens now: the President nomi-
nates a successor, and the Sen-
ate gets to “advise and consent.” 
If Obama nominates a quali?ed, 
unifying candidate, it is incum-
bent upon the Senate to con?rm 
him or her. To do anything else 
would mar Scalia’s legacy and dis-
honor his life of service.

intent. This means that they could 
actually have no malicious intent, 
until willfully misinterpreted. For ex-
ample, asking an Asian American or 
Latino American “Where were you 
born?” may be considered a micro-
aggression, since you could be inter-
preted as implying that they aren’t a 
real American. Other statements that 
are considered microaggressions by 
the University of California system 
are: “America is the land of oppor-
tunity” and “I believe the most quali-
?ed person should get the job.” This 
is chillingly reminiscent of Arthur 
Miller’s play The Crucible: all that is 
needed to prove your case is to gener-
ate the right amount of hysteria.
An incident that captures this per-
fectly was the Halloween debacle at 
Yale. Following a mass email sent to 
the student body about appropriate 
costumes, Erika Christakis, the then 
Associate Master of Silliman Col-
lege, sent out an email basically ask-
ing the students to decide for them-
selves whether a costume would be 
considered offensive or not. “Have 
we lost faith in young people’s capac-
ity — in your capacity — to exercise 
self-censure, through social norming, 
and also in your capacity to ignore or 
reject things that trouble you?” You 
would think that granting students 
the courtesy of autonomy and respect 
would have resulted in reciprocal 
courtesy. No such luck. “Be quiet!” a 
Yale student yells at Nicholas Chris-
takis, the Master of Silliman College, 
in a temper tantrum fortunately cap-
tured on video. When Christakis dis-
agrees with her, rather than respond-
ing like an adult, the student goes on 
to yell “Who the fuck are you? ... It 
is not about creating an intellectual 
space! ... It is about creating a home 
here!”
There you have it, the fundamental 
problem, the misconception at the 
root of this poison tree whose fruit 
are being plucked on campuses all 
over the nation. It isn’t about creating 
an intellectual space, but a home, a 
safe-space, where we will never feel 
uncomfortable, never have to face 
dissenting opinions like an adult, nev-
er have to confront con?icting views 
except through mass hysteria and 
the strategic use of the magic words 
trigger warning and microaggres-
sion. The macroaggression from the 
student body ended up causing Erika 
Christakis to quit her position at Yale 
due to, as she put it, the climate not 
being “conducive to civil dialogue.”
How does this affect us at Carn-
egie Mellon? The beauty of it is that it 
doesn’t. Incidents like this have hap-
pened at Yale, University of Michigan, 
Claremont McKenna and many other 
prestigious institutions, but not here. 
We need to realize how lucky we are 
and try hard to preserve it. In Spot-
light on Speech Codes 2016, FIRE 
surveyed 440 schools on their nomi-
nal speech code policies, policies 
that tend to restrict the First Amend-
ment rights of students. They classify 
schools as one of either Red, Yellow 
or Green Light, where a red light in-
stitution is one that “has at least one 
policy both clearly and substantially 
restricting freedom of speech, or 
that bars public access to its speech-
related policies,” while a green light 
campus is one whose “policies do 
not seriously threaten campus ex-
pression.” Of the 440 schools, 49.3 
percent were found to be red light 
(including Princeton, Swarthmore, 
CalTech, and Harvard) while only 22 
schools were found to be green light, 
including Carnegie Mellon! I didn’t 
realize what a stroke of good fortune 
it is to attend a college that doesn’t 
seek to curtail our right to freedom of 
expression, but apparently it’s quite a 
lot to ask.
Meanwhile, in a survey of incom-
ing college freshmen released two 
weeks ago, the Higher Education Re-
search Institute at the University of 
California at Los Angeles found that 
43 percent of incoming freshmen be-
lieve that colleges have the right to 
ban extreme speakers from campus, 
while a whopping 71 percent think 
that racist/sexist speech should be 
prohibited. If we’re not careful, we 
might not be in the green light for 
much longer.
In a town hall meeting in Des 
Moines, Iowa, President Obama stat-
ed that the purpose of college is “to 
widen your horizons, to make you a 
better citizen, to help you to evaluate 
information, to help you make your 
way through the world, to help you 
be more creative.” He continued to 
say that “the way to do that is to cre-
ate a space where a lot of ideas are 
presented and collide, and people 
are having arguments, and people 
are testing each other’s theories and 
over time people learn from each 
other because they’re getting out of 
their own narrow point of view and 
having a broader point of view.” This 
process isn’t comfortable. At times it 
can be quite infuriating. I spent most 
of a night last week trying to convince 
my friend that cultural appropriation 
is actually an issue. Was it frustrat-
ing? Sure. But in the process, I uncov-
ered a plethora of assumptions and 
biases that I had been conditioned 
not to question. And that’s what col-
lege is about: creating a space where 
it is safe to express any opinion or 
idea, not just those considered worth 
protecting.
Trigger warnings ignite ignorance
frenetic schedule and visited more 
nations than any other Secretary of 
State. Known for her solid adminis-
tration of the State Department, she 
pushed forward initiatives to ex-
pand American in?uence on human 
rights, most notably to empower 
women in the developing world.
Given her contentious public im-
age, however, what is more impres-
sive is how those who have person-
ally worked with Clinton seem to 
come away with positive impres-
sions of her. When Clinton began 
her tenure as a senator for New York, 
she was booed by the relatively con-
servative New York City police and 
?re?ghters once as she introduced 
a Paul McCartney concert. Yet six 
years later in her re-election bid, she 
nonetheless won the endorsement 
of the NYC Fire Of?cers Association, 
according to the New York Times. 
According to The Atlantic, many 
of Clinton’s colleagues in the Sen-
ate initially viewed her as nothing 
more than a celebrity politician, but 
came away impressed with her com-
mitment to keeping her head down 
and working with colleagues on 
low-pro?le but important issues. Al-
though she faced off with President 
Obama in a bitter primary, she was 
steadfastly loyal to him as Secretary 
of State and became one of his clos-
est advisers.
Clinton is one of the leading ?g-
ures in politics not because of some 
vast conspiracy, but because she 
has a willingness to reach out and 
work with people, a demonstrated 
sense of industriousness, and a deep 
appreciation and understanding of 
policy.
When Obama was elected into 
of?ce in 2008, one of the major 
setbacks that plagued his ?rst term 
was his lack of political experience. 
He had simply promised too much 
without any realistic expectations of 
how it should be implemented and 
had to spend most of his ?rst term 
?guring out what to do. In his sec-
ond term he has been much more 
capable in using both the hard and 
soft powers of the presidency and 
had much stronger relations within 
the government, which led to nu-
merous achievements such as more 
stringent environmental policies, 
an executive order on immigration 
reform, and the nuclear deal with 
Iran.
For Democrats, 2016 is critical. 
The next president will preside over 
an era where three of the Supreme 
Court Justices are nearing the age 
of 80 and will face an obstructive 
Republican Congress. They can’t af-
ford for another president to waste 
four years learning the ropes of the 
presidency, especially an ideologue 
as sorely lacking in policy depth and 
leadership as Bernie Sanders.
It is easy to voice indignant an-
ger, but it is dif?cult to actually 
channel this anger into action. In 
the end, the results speak for them-
selves: for all Sanders’ impassioned 
speeches on progressive causes, 
Hillary Clinton has actually accom-
plished more of Bernie Sanders’ 
platform than Sanders himself.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team took the court 
on Friday to host Emory Uni-
versity in University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play. The 
Tartans played a scrappy 
game, but the Eagles ultimate-
ly took the victory 83–68. This 
loss puts the Tartans at 9–14 
overall, and 2–10 in UAA com-
petition.
The game opened with 
Emory taking a swift six-point 
lead over the Tartans, demon-
strating some impressive ball 
movement around the Tar-
tan defense, and using their 
size advantage to make plays 
around the net. But Carnegie 
Mellon did not stay down for 
long. A jumper from sopho-
more Ryan Maha gave the Tar-
tans some breathing room and 
decreased Emory’s lead, pull-
ing the score to 20–16 at the 
12-minute mark of the ?rst 
half. The Eagles were having 
none of that, however. Over 
the next six minutes, the Ea-
gles put together a 16–4 scor-
ing run to take a 36–20 lead, 
increasing their lead to 28 at 
one point, and eventually end-
ing the half leading 53–27.
The game began to look 
grim for the Tartans as the 
?rst half slowed to an end. 
Emory managed to convert 11 
?rst-half turnovers by the Tar-
tans into 23 points, while the 
Tartans could only force one 
single mishap from Emory. 
After the ?rst 20 minutes of 
play, the Eagles had converted 
11 out of 17 three-point shots, 
and shot 50 percent from 
the ?oor. The Tartans shot 
a respectable 43.5 percent 
from the ?oor, but it was not 
enough to slow down the train 
that Emory brought to Skibo 
Gym. 
Despite the abysmal ?rst 
half, the Tartans did not give 
up or throw in the towel. As the 
second half went underway, 
it appeared as if the Tartans 
were genuinely going to make 
a comeback. Carnegie Mellon 
opened the second half with 
an entirely unexpected 24–3 
scoring run. Carnegie Mellon 
kept Emory without a score 
from the ?eld for the ?rst 10 
minutes of the second half. 
The Eagles missed their ?rst 
16 shots in the second half of 
the game, but despite this dry 
spell, they maintained a lead 
that came to ?ve points at its 
lowest. Once Emory broke out 
of the spell, they scored the 
next seven points and pushed 
the score to 63–51. The Tar-
tans would remain trailing by 
double digits for the rest of the 
night.
Though Emory was a good 
team and Carnegie Mellon 
was expecting a challenge, 
this loss hurts for the Tartan 
squad. Losing is never a fun 
experience, but the feeling 
becomes even stronger when 
you know your team didn’t 
play well. Of course, this was 
not the Tartan’s best game. 
Though Carnegie Mellon did 
have a higher shooting per-
centage than Emory from the 
?eld, the real difference came 
in turnovers. Emory doubled 
the amount of turnovers that 
Carnegie Mellon created, a 
whopping 18 turnovers to 
Carnegie Mellon’s nine. This 
is the most crucial statistic 
in determining the Tartan’s 
mistakes. The points that Em-
ory scored from those turn-
overs totaled to 35, whereas 
Carnegie Mellon only man-
aged 12 points off turnovers. 
The points scored from turn-
overs total to a 23-point lead 
by themselves, and any team 
would have a hard time win-
ning if they give up possession 
that many times.
Junior Jack Serbin did 
manage to get his 14th dou-
ble-double for the Tartans, 
scoring a team-high 15 points 
with 14 rebounds. Maha 
was the only other player to 
score in double digits with 11 
points. If the Tartans want to 
win games, they’re going to 
have to stop giving the ball up 
and be much more aggressive 
in pressing their advantages.
On Sunday, the Tartan 
men’s basketball team faced 
off against the University of 
Rochester in what turned out 
to be the highest scoring game 
of the season, and emerged 
victorious to a score of 102–97 
in a double-overtime heater. 
The win moves the Tartans’ 
record to 10–14, 3–10 in UAA 
play. This win also means 
that the Tartans are now 21–1 
when scoring 100 points or 
more in a single game since 
the 1947–48 season.
Carnegie Mellon fell be-
hind at ?rst, trailing 18–6 
within the ?rst six minutes of 
the game. The Tartans then 
went on a 10–3 scoring run 
to come within one point at 
21–20. With less than three 
minutes left in the half, senior 
Blake Chasen gave the Tartans 
their ?rst lead of the game 
thanks to a foul shot. At the 
halftime break, the Tartans 
held a one-point advantage at 
33–32 and were prepared to 
keep ?ghting.
Both teams came into the 
second half with a hot scoring 
hand. Rochester scored on its 
?rst ?ve shots, while Carnegie 
Mellon converted its ?rst 
seven. The Tartans continued 
to edge ahead thanks to the 
scoring efforts of sophomore 
Ryan Maha. The game stayed 
close, and neither team led by 
more than ?ve points at any 
point in the rest of the half. 
Rochester held a ?ve-point 
advantage with just over a 
minute left to play in the sec-
ond half, but a layup from ju-
nior Chris Shkil followed by a 
three-pointer from junior Jack 
Serbin tied the game and sent 
it into overtime.
Carnegie Mellon opened 
overtime with quick scores, 
draining multiple three-
pointers to gain its largest 
lead of the game. Rochester 
scored the next ?ve points, 
and the Tartans were ahead 
88–86 with nine seconds to 
play. However, the visiting 
team got the last shot and 
made it count, tying the game 
and sending it into yet another 
overtime period.
Maha was the hero of the 
second overtime period, scor-
ing nine of his career-best 25 
points in double overtime 
alone. With ?ve seconds left, a 
pair of foul shots from Serbin 
sealed the victory for the 
Tartans.
Maha led the Tartans in 
scoring with his career-best 25 
points, as well as four assists. 
Serbin also made his mark on 
the game with 19 points and 
17 rebounds to record his ?f-
teenth double-double. Shkil 
also grabbed 12 points and 12 
rebounds to record his fourth 
double-double.
The Tartans will ?nish the 
season with a home contest at 
home against UAA rival Case 
Western Reserve University 
on Saturday, Feb. 27 at 5 p.m.

The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s basketball team competed 
against Emory University on 
Friday in a very tough fought 
game. The Tartans came out 
on top of the Eagles by a score 
of 70–62, avenging their 63–
52 loss in Atlanta earlier this 
season.
The start of the game saw 
the Tartans and the Eagles 
matching each other for 
points. At a critical juncture, 
senior forward Liza Otto was 
covered tight by two Emory 
players, but still got the ball 
out to junior guard Jackie 
Hudepohl who managed to 
get an easy basket. From there, 
the Tartans began to build a 
lead with junior center and 
forward Lisa Murphy leading 
the charge in a 13–0 run. Fol-
lowing this run, Emory took 
advantage of three Tartan 
turnovers, bringing the game 
to 20–15 before the end of the 
quarter.
In the second quarter, Em-
ory tied the game up 22–22 
before taking their ?rst lead 
since the early minutes of the 
game as the Tartans were un-
able to keep up their early 
scoring run. A foul after Mur-
phy made a basket got the Tar-
tans back into the lead. Both 
teams continued to ?ght hard 
against each other as the Tar-
tans managed to hold onto the 
lead at the end of the half with 
a 34–32 score.
In the third quarter, the 
Tartans were able to build on 
their lead by scoring seven 
shots from inside the paint be-
fore the Eagles started to come 
back again. The Tartans held 
onto a 52–48 lead going into 
the ?nal quarter.
The fourth quarter saw 
the Eagles continuing to ?ght 
back with a number of three-
point shots helping to close the 
gap. After the Eagles retook 
the lead when they capped 
off a 12–6 run, the Tartans 
came back immediately with a 
three-pointer by senior guard 
Lindsay Poss, that kicked off a 
12–0 run. As the Tartans con-
tinued to expand their lead, 
the Eagles became desperate 
to ?ght the clock, making fouls 
in an attempt to limit Carnegie 
Mellon’s possessions. The Tar-
tans refused to relinquish the 
lead, and the team easily held 
on to win.
Murphy continues to be 
one of the biggest contributors 
to the team’s success. The psy-
chology major has been one of 
the most dominant players in 
Tartan history, having broken 
the school records in points 
scored, ?eld goals made, ?eld 
goal percentage, free throws 
made, and free throws at-
tempted during her ?rst year 
on the squad. She then pro-
ceeded to trump almost all of 
those marks last season, and 
she hasn’t stopped there. Mur-
phy has already improved on 
her records of points scored 
and ?eld goals made. Mur-
phy’s 32 points during the 
night was the sixth time this 
season she scored 31 or more 
points despite not having even 
attempted a three-point ?eld 
goal this season. Though her 
opponents know she will be 
a challenge, she continues to 
?nd ways to get points from 
the paint, freeing up her team-
mates to make plays of their 
own.
Hudepohl scored 17 points, 
including four of six free 
throw attempts during the 
?nal minute as Emory tried 
to make an impossible come-
back. Otto came up with 11 
points and four assists, and 
Poss totaled 10 points, 12 re-
bounds, and four assists.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on the University of 
Rochester Yellow Jackets and 
upset their 12th-ranked UAA 
opponent. Carnegie Mellon 
held a strong offensive grip 
on the game and never let up. 
Hudepohl scored a career-best 
29 points and 10 rebounds to 
record her ?fth double-double 
of the season. Murphy scored 
27 points on 11 of 16 shots, 
and also tabbed 17 rebounds 
along with ?ve blocks. Otto 
also broke a career record with 
26 points to contribute to the 
Tartans’ scoring extravaganza.
The Tartans will close 
out the season in a rematch 
against Case Western Reserve 
University on Saturday, Feb. 
27.

The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team took the 
court on Friday against 11th-
ranked Pomona-Pitzer Col-
lege in the quarter?nal round 
of the ITA National Team In-
door Championship. The Tar-
tans defeated the second seed 
with a 5–4 score, bringing 
them to 5–2 on the season. 
The Tartans started the com-
petition off strong in doubles 
play from the pair of ?rst-
years Daniel Levine and Va-
yum Arora, taking ?rst dou-
bles decisively with a score 
of 8–3. Seniors Abhishek Alla 
and Yuvraj Kumar won 8–6 
in third doubles, and sopho-
more Jeffrey Chen fell in a 
tiebreaker for second doubles 
with a score of 9–8(9–7).
Carnegie Mellon fell be-
hind 3–2 as Pomona-Pitzer 
took ?rst and ?fth singles, 
but Levine managed to even 
the score again in second 
singles, winning 6–4, 7–5.  
The Tartans then gained 
an advantage thanks to a 
come from behind victory in 
fourth singles with a score of 
4–6, 6–4, 6–3. Junior Kenny 
Zheng scored the ?fth and 
?nal point for the Tartans, 
winning 7–6(7–4), 3–6, 7–5 
in third singles.
On Saturday, the team 
advanced to the semi?nal 
round of the tournament and 
fell to University Athletic As-
sociation (UAA) opponent 
Emory University. First-years 
Levine and Arora earned the 
?rst point of the match in ?rst 
doubles, winning 8–5. Emory 
tied the match in third dou-
bles, but the combination of 
Chen and Zheng pulled off a 
9–7 victory in second doubles 
to put the Tartans back in 
the lead heading into singles 
play.
Unfortunately, singles play 
did not go as well as doubles. 
The only point for the Tartans 
in singles play came from 
Chaz Downing in sixth sin-
gles, winning 6–2, 2–6, 10–2. 
The Tartans were disappoint-
ed, but they moved on to play 
in the third place match on 
Sunday for a chance at some 
sort of redemption.
That redemption did not 
come for the Tartans in the 
third place match. Carnegie 
Mellon fell 5–4 in a barn 
burner against University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
rival Case Western Reserve 
University. The loss drops the 
Tartans to 5–4 on the season, 
and they took fourth place in 
the tournament.
Doubles play gave the Tar-
tans con?dence and allowed 
them to gain a lead. Senior 
pair Alla and Kumar fought 
their way to a 9–7 victory in 
third doubles, while the pair 
of Chen and Zheng managed 
to score their own point for 
the Tartans. The team headed 
into singles play with a 2–1 
lead.
Levine kept the Tartans in 
the game with a nail-biting 
win in three sets, edging out 
his opponent 6–2, 3–6, 6–2 to 
bring the score to 4–3. Fresh-
man Downing showed his 
prowess in singles play once 
again, scoring the ?nal point 
for the Tartan in sixth singles, 
6–4, 6–1. Case Western Re-
serve managed to ?nd victo-
ries in ?rst, third, fourth, and 
?fth singles to put the Tar-
tans away.
This marks the second 
fourth-place ?nish for the 
Tartans in four appearances 
at the ITA National Indoor 
Championship. The next 
challenge begins for the Tar-
tans on Sunday, March 6 in 
Claremont, California as they 
take on Whittier College.

MORF performs exhibition of female pride
The Vagina Monologues highlight the experiences of being a woman in today’s world
This past Monday, Feb. 15, I was able to witness the 
sheer splendor that was The Vagina Monologues, 
produced and performed by members of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Mobilization of Resolute Feminists (MORF) 
organization and directed by senior science and 
humanities scholar, Sophie Zucker. This social-
experiment-turned-production is one of my favorites, 
and while it may be “the classic ‘college feminist’ 
production,” according to the show’s pamphlet, I truly 
believe it’s an important piece for one to experience. 
As a cisgender male, I will never be able to actually 
perform in this production, but I can sure watch and 
listen to it whenever I get the chance.
There were several amazing moments in this 
production. Staged in the Cohon Center’s Peter/
Wright/McKenna rooms, with just a row of wrinkly 
red curtains as a backdrop, no lighting other than 
the overhead fluorescents, and a room not quite 
conducive to vocal projection, the show appeared at 
face-value to be a little under-budget. But consider 
for a moment that only two years ago, MORF had 
only three members and was just getting off its feet 
at this university. Since this organization’s number 
one mission is not theatre, but the advancement of 
woman’s rights and freedoms, any critical reader 
should step back and realize how fantastic this 
production actually was. 
The namesake “Vagina Monologues” transcend 
the stage on which they are performed. They are a 
written chorus of voices, and in line with that, it’s 
rather lovely how spare the setting was. The Vagina 
Monologues are a set of spoken pieces which were 
the product of their author, Eve Ensler’s, mission to 
interview women about their vaginas. The result is a 
powerful and hysterical production.
Moving onto the actual performance, the scene 
was set by junior dramaturg Margaret Marchese, 
graduate music student Katie Russell, and junior 
architecture major Victoria Yong, who recited the 
monologues’s introduction. The trio did a wonderful 
job at conveying their collective “worry” about 
vaginas, and their comedic timing when describing 
the various nicknames women had for their vaginas 
(the best of which being “poopi,” “poopelu,” and 
“Gladys Seagelman”) was lovely. Through the entirety 
of this production, each participant held note cards, 
which for any other production would be a travesty, 
but for this production, the note cards were apparently 
mandated by the monologues’ directing rules, which 
state that one must perform them with a script of 
some kind to remind the audience that the stories 
were taken from real women across the world, not 
simply the lone actress’s experiences.
The performance began with Hair, performed by 
sophomore English, history, and chemistry major, 
Karishma Manglani. Manglani held a very nice tone 
throughout; as she recited this monologue, she hit 
on some of the deeply emotional aspects. She was 
vulnerable when she needed to be, when reciting the 
portion about being forcefully shaved by her husband, 
and overall, her portrayal of this monologue’s voice 
was very nicely done. This monologue strikes a chord 
in anyone who has been told to change to “please” his 
or her spouse, and it tackles a rather prevalent idea 
that women must shave to be attractive.
The Wear and Say Lists, performed by sophomore 
statistics major Lilian Chin, philosophy and 
psychology senior Naomi Berman, and drama 
sophomore Kate Burgess, is one of my favorite 
portions of this show. It’s all about asking women 
what their vaginas would say and wear if they were 
capable of coherent speech and could actually dress 
up. My favorite options are always “something 
machine washable,” “lace and combat boots,” and “an 
electrical shock device to keep unwanted strangers 
away” for the question of “what would [your vagina] 
wear,” and “remember me?” and “come inside” for the 
question of “what would [your vagina] say?”
One of the most poignant pieces from this production 
was The Little Coochie Snorcher That Could, 
performed by junior science and humanities scholar 
Alexandria Moriarty. This monologue details a girl’s 
evolution of vaginal experience, from accidentally 
impaling her vagina on a bedpost, to being sexually 
assaulted, to finally being sexually enlightened by a 
self-empowered feminist woman. It was a very well 
done performance, and though Moriarty kept using 
the word “coochie snorcher,” the seriousness of the 
content and the overall solemn excitement of much of 
this piece was kept in-tact and respected.
Out of all of the monologues, three of them really 
stood out to me performance-wise. Out of the many 
monologues, I have always been partial to The Flood, 
which is my absolute favorite, about an old woman 
who had never had sex because she would always 
get a little too excited. I also love My Angry Vagina 
and The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy, 
especially in this production.
The Flood, performed by junior creative writing and 
philosophy student Ariel Hoffmaier, is always my 
clear favorite, just because I adore the character of 
this monologue, and if I were at all able to perform it, I 
would. Hoffmaier is naturally a beautiful fit for the role 
of an old Jewish woman, and her portrayal was pretty 
much spot-on to how I pictured this scene unfolding 
in my head. I particularly love the portion where the 
woman talks about her dreams about partying with 
Burt Reynolds, and how they were so happy, until she 
would inevitably flood the whole restaurant with her 
excitement.
My Angry Vagina is a great piece. Performed by 
Heather Graci, a freshman in Dietrich College, this 
monologue tackles the discomfort of examination and 
artificial vagina care products, such as tampons and 
freshening products. Graci’s acting was lovely and 
hysterical; she really understood the furious comedy 
of the piece and was able to deliver a humorous and 
striking performance.
The Woman Who Loved to Make Vaginas Happy, 
performed by sophomore music student Jacqueline 
Tardanico, seemed to be far and away the crowd’s 
favorite performance. Tardanico committed to this 
role. This monologue describes a woman who used 
to be a lawyer, but is now a lesbian sex worker, who 
loves making women moan. This monologue, when 
spoken, has a wide range of possibilities; around the 
final portion of the monologue is a list of moan types, 
and with each one, Tardanico actually got onto the 
floor and acted out each of them. In detail. She had 
obviously done her research because her moans were 
spot-on and spectacular. Needless to say, the audience 
was living for her beautiful, howling rendition of a 
lesbian sex worker pleasuring her moaning partners.
The Vagina Monologues is such a powerful exhibition 
of womanhood and female pride that its got me 
wishing that, if only for a second, I too could be proud 
of my vagina.

I believe we’re approaching what the internet likes 
to call ‘Peak Superhero.’ Studios have realized what 
makes them the most money, and everyone seems 
to be in a rush to make as many superhero movies 
as they can. After the success of ?lms like The 
Avengers and Iron Man, Hollywood is looking for the 
proverbial ‘next big movie;’ everyone is trying to 
replicate that success to get a piece of the pie. With 
an increasing number of these movies each year, 
the bubble is likely to burst at some point. Now, 
being a hard-core superhero and comic book fan, 
I’m not one to complain. These movies bring with 
them a lot of hype with the relentless marketing 
campaigns. I personally savor the wait, reading up 
on fan theories, learning more and more about the 
?lm (avoiding spoilers, of course), and ?nally leading 
up to the night I go see it. That’s the fun of it!
Among this sea of upcoming superhero movies, 
Deadpool arrives. Not only does it make a huge 
splash, but it turns the water around it red. If you’re 
a superhero movie fan like me, you should probably 
be wondering where you’ve heard of ‘Deadpool’ 
before. That’s right, the character has been on the 
big screen before, in X-Men Origins: Wolverine. If 
you’ve seen that movie, you know they (spoiler alert) 
literally sew his mouth shut in the latter half. So the 
character lovingly called the Merc with the Mouth 
has no mouth and cannot speak. Great. Luckily for 
us, not this time. Fox has let their ?lmmakers go 
completely wild, and they have more than redeemed 
themselves after destroying the character in Origins.
The actual plot of the movie is a standard superhero 
origin story. Wade Wilson ?nds out he has terminal 
cancer, and gets a very special therapy for his 
cancer, which activates his mutant healing abilities 
but, to quote from the movie, leaves him looking 
“like an avocado had sex with an older avocado” 
and thus un?t to mingle with general society. So he 
dons a red suit (think Spider-Man meets a ninja) and 
goes around killing a bunch of people who get in his 
way. You may be wondering why the red suit? I’ll 
let the movie answer that, and if you don’t get that 
reference, please go see the trailers.
The magic of the movie is the fun Ryan Reynolds 
and ?lmmakers have had with it. In true Deadpool 
fashion, the ridiculous gags and demented 
commentary keep coming, turning the otherwise 
conventional story completely sideways. Wade 
Wilson is unglued, and because he is so unglued, 
he has a tendency to break the fourth wall and 
speak to the audience. He knows he’s a ?ctional 
character! This hyper awareness is classic 
Deadpool and makes him the perfect medicine to 
our superhero fatigue. It’s a superhero movie 
about a guy who doesn’t want to be one. 
It’s a superhero movie with nudity and 
ultra-violence. An R-rated superhero 
movie? Aren’t these movies meant 
for kids? Deadpool not only isn’t meant 
for kids, but the squeamish might have 
a few *gasp* — did that just happen 
— moments. And surprisingly, despite 
the insanity, the movie manages to have a 
romantic backstory that actually just about 
works, thanks to Ryan Reynolds’ and Morena 
Baccarin’s sizzling chemistry.
Deadpool makes extensive use of CGI and 
‘bullet-timey’ slow motion stunts, but 
it works perfectly with the general 
zaniness of the movie. They made 
this on a (relatively) low budget 
and what they’ve done with what 
they had is quite amazing. The 
opening scene itself is testament 
to that. The ?rst 20 minutes of the 
movie are some of the best, and 
make sure you don’t text during 
the opening or the closing credits. 
Also, there are post-credits scenes. 
Two of them. Do not leave without 
seeing them.
Deadpool is a celebration of ultra-violence, sexual 
innuendos, and all around insanity. If you haven’t 
seen the trailers, go see them NOW. Wait a few 
hours, let your brain marinate in the awesomeness 
of what you just saw, and then go see the movie 
before it’s pulled from the theaters. Oh, and 
remember to take ID. The movie is rated R, and for 
good reason.

Walking into The Frick Museum of Pittsburgh is like 
being transported to another time. The converted 19th 
century mansion of Henry Clay Frick and his family 
now houses Fast Cars and Femmes Fatales, a collection 
of photographs originally taken by Frenchman 
Jacque Henri Lartigue in the early 1900s. While these 
photographs can be described as domestic, the life 
of the Lartigue family had no shortage of action to be 
captured.
Lartigue was born into a privileged family in 1894 
and began taking photographs at the age of six, the 
same time that the infamous Kodak Brownie camera 
entered the market, making photography accessible to 
amateurs and children. He quickly outgrew the smaller, 
mass-market cameras, and since money was no object 
for his family, he soon had a full-sized view camera of 
his own to create images of beautiful quality.
The exhibition displays images from 1907-1958, 
beginning with some of the boyhood images that were 
made famous by Charles Rado of the Rapho agency in 
1963 when Lartigue was 69. Given that Lartigue was 
still a child when he took the images, the photographs 
are strikingly beautiful. What makes these prints from 
a glass plate negative particularly compelling is that 
they were created not by a meticulous and practiced 
professional but by a child.
Lartigue’s father often lent him his camera to use, and 
the image produced by a view camera with glass plate 
negatives has a unique quality that is said to transcend 
even the high resolution of today’s digital cameras. 
An image of Lartigue’s father driving 55 mph in one 
of his many cars is blurry because of the motion, but 
this enhances the image’s accessibility to the viewer. 
Without the formality of a well-composed photograph, 
the viewer feels personally invited into the exciting 
events of Lartigue’s life.
Soon after the boyhood images, the exhibit presents a 
series of fashion photographs taken in Paris. The hats 
alone are stunning, and the posture of the actresses 
and fashionistas radiates con?dence. They likely 
set a precedent for one of the most prominent street 
photographers of the era, Henri Cartier-Bresson. 
While Cartier-Bresson’s images were grittier and more 
representative of the city as a whole, Lartigue’s shots 
were a study of a microcosm of opulence, celebrity, and 
beauty.
We also get a glimpse of the Grand Prix of 1913 with 
racecar driver Dario Resta. One image shows us the 
perspective from the headlights to the driver’s seat 
with the long expanse of engine in between. Lartigue 
also had fun with the audience, capturing a moment 
where women and men are lounging by the side of the 
track, in a posture suggesting complete boredom.
His satirical eye is also apparent through many images 
of the exhibition. One image in particular can elicit a 
genuine belly laugh in the middle of a generally quiet 
exhibition hall, so be careful. This image is of a friend, 
Sascha, whom is pictured getting slammed in the head 
by a wave. 
This photograph is amazing because, in order to 
get it, Lartigue had to have brought a 5x7 inch view 
camera (picture one of those old time cameras with 
the accordion-looking bellows) into the ocean. After 
the initial visual impact, you notice the image is titled, 
“Sascha’s only swim.” These moments of humor are 
scattered throughout the show, displaying the artist’s 
playful side.
The women of Lartigue’s life are also represented 
in the show. The only two color images shown are 
of Bibi, Lartigue’s ?rst wife. A subsequent series of 
pictures showcase Lartigue’s two other wives — both 
of whom are young, beautiful, and fashionable. Their 
expressions are as practiced as those of models, and 
the clothing and jewelry makes one suspect that these 
are photographs from Vogue magazine.
The last, and arguably most famous, series of 
photographs is a collection on Pablo Picasso, from 
a time when he and Lartigue were spending time 
together in Paris. They are rare and intimate photos of 
the painter in the later years of life.
Lartigue was a painter and photographer that liked 
to shoot slice-of-life pictures: intimate moments of 
his family and friends, sporting events like tennis 
and racecar driving, or outings to the aviation ?eld. 
His “day-to-day” life consists of almost unbelievable 
adventure. The photographs’ informal nature and 
satirical bent combined with their skillful execution 
invite the viewer to experience France in the early 20th 
century for themselves.

pillbox 02.22.167
‘Twas Valentines’ Eve, and just off South Craig,
There was no food in the fridge, not even an egg,
Two ladies were pondering what they should have,
And with a quick search, they were off to Central Ave.
In the spirit of Parks and Rec’s beloved Leslie Knope, 
my roommate and I decided to have a great Galentine’s 
Day dinner together. The restaurant that caught my 
eye was an Ethiopian restaurant, entitled “Tana.” 
Immediately intrigued by the idea of trying of what the 
website promised to be “authentic cuisine” with “herbs 
and spices imported directly from Ethiopia,” I called 
and made a reservation for two.
Because it was well below freezing that night, we 
decided to take an Uber, and had little trouble ?nding 
the place. The restaurant is set up very simply. Tables 
with simple white tablecloths are positioned to line the 
plain white walls. There were some intriguing pieces 
of Ethiopian folk art put up, placed tastefully to cater to 
the minimalist feel of the establishment.
Ordering our meal was an interesting experience. Much 
to our surprise, we were told that we had the option of 
ordering two sides per dish, and the waiter suggested 
some vegetarian sides to go with our meaty mains. 
The distinct spices were very new to my South Asian 
palette. 
They were rich, loud, and well-complemented by the 
cooling sides. Like Indian food, Ethiopian food is meant 
to be eaten by hand, by using the carby component of 
the dish to make small pockets and scoop up the meat 
and vegetable components. Here’s a rundown of what 
we tried:
Denich Selata (Potato Salad): This was more mashed 
down than your typical potato salad, and was bursting 
with lively acidity from the vinegar and lime added to 
it. It refreshed the palate in between bites of the ?avor-
heavy mains, and was a great asset to the meal.
Kay Sir Selata (Beet Salad): I was very excited about 
this salad and very pleased with what arrived. It was 
cool, cleansing, and very well ?avored. Simple, and 
delicious. Interestingly, the beets were crunchier than I 
expected, which added a some much needed texture to 
the otherwise very soft collection of food items.
Shiro Wat: This dish was an entree that was served to 
us in a smaller portion as a side. It consisted of roasted 
chickpeas that were ground up and seasoned. It too 
was simple, and balanced out the complexity of the 
other dishes.
Fossolia: The menu describes this as “green beans and 
carrots in Tana’s special tomato-based garlic and herb 
sauce.” The beans and carrots were cooked to a lovely 
softness, and the overall taste was sweet and garlicky 
all at once. My roommate loved this side the most out of 
all those we tried that night.
Doro Wat (Chicken): This dish had two sauce 
options: the Kay Wot (hot) in Berbere Sauce and Alicia 
Wot (mild) in Turmeric Sauce. We went for the hot 
sauce which turned out to be milder than expected. 
Nevertheless, the ?avors were rich. 
There was quite a bit of salt in the dish, so if you’re 
not down with the sodium chloride scene, beware. 
The chicken arrives on the bone as a drumstick, and is 
covered in the dark sauce. It was a very unique taste 
experience.
Tana Tibs (Lamb): This dish was the hero of the night. 
The ?avor of the lamb and the intensity of the Ethiopian 
spices came together harmoniously. The lamb, like the 
chicken, was cooked incredibly tenderly, and the ?avor 
from the sauce had seeped into the meat, so no piece 
felt too dry or too bland. A must try.
Hot spiced tea: With my neverending quest to try all 
tea that I come across, seeing this on the menu made 
my heart sing. The tea seemed to be made from a mix 
of spices, of which clove was the most dominant. It 
complemented the food well, both because of its heat 
and its components. A sweeter tea would have broken 
the ?ow of ?avor that all of the dishes contributed to. I 
would de?nitely order it again if given the chance.
Cha-ching: Tana takes both cash and card, and is good 
with splitting the check for groups.
Herbivores, Omnivores, and Carnivores, lend me 
your ears: Ethiopian food has great, healthy, protein-
rich options for both vegetarians and non-vegetarians.
Are we there yet?: Tana is within walking distance 
from Target in East Liberty, and Market District on 
Centre Ave, so if you’re in the area, you won’t have to 
go too far. From campus, I would either take an Uber 
(given how cold it is outside), or if you’re willing to 
time your trip, the 71B from Fifth and Morewood, the 
71C from Craig Street at Park Plaza, or the 75 from 
Ellsworth Ave at Morewood Ave. Here’s the address: 
5929 Baum Blvd, Pittsburgh, PA 15206.
Click, click: Tana has a great website, with its menu, 
an about page, it’s location, catering information, and 
much more. Check it out: https://tanaethiopiancuisine.
com/site/restaurants/tana-ethiopian-cuisine/
For those stay-at-home days: Tana has a takeout 
option, and you can order what you’d like online 
from their website. You do have to login and make an 
account to do this though. There is no home delivery 
option, unless, of course, you go through a third party 
delivery service.
Hours: 
Sun–Thu: 5–10 p.m.
Fri –  Sat: 11:30 a.m. – 2:30 p.m. for lunch and 5 p.m. – 
11 p.m. for dinner
Here’s a number if you have any questions in regard to 
reservations, hours, the menu, etc: (412) 665-2770
21+: Tana offers a variety of Ethiopian beer and wine 
(not seen on the website), although their authentic 
Ethiopian coffee is much more famous.
Ambience: Relaxed, homely, very friendly. The waiters 
were very kind and happy to explain how to order the 
food, and gave great recommendations.
College student friendly?: I was surprised to see 
many college students, some who even looked like grad 
students. Most of the people seated in Tana came as 
fairly large groups, which was understandable after 
I realized how much food it took to ?ll me up. The 
portions are pretty big, so feel free to take the pack out 
for a feast.

8psychosis
pillbox 02.22.16
*Trigger Warning: Discussion of sexual assault and suicide*
“What do you offer your friends to make them so supportive?” 
The stage lights come up and the lone woman on the stage 
plays this refrain from her smartphone. Standing on a coffee 
table she rotates slowly so that each side of the audience can 
hear the phrase as it repeats. “What do you offer your friends 
to make them so supportive?”
This weekend, 4.48 Psychosis, a hauntingly poetic play 
written by British playwright Sarah Kane opened in the 
John Wells Studio, the smallest theater space on the ?rst 
?oor of the Purnell Center for the Arts. The play, written as a 
stream-of-consciousness epic poem without any discernible 
characters or plot, was brought to life in starkly intimate 
detail by senior directing student John Moriarty, and 
intensely performed by junior acting student Mckenna Slone 
and senior acting student Zach Fifer. With a set created by 
scenic design senior, Nathan Brown, the audience is allowed 
to look in on a few days, months, or years of one woman’s 
struggle with depression.
4.48 Psychosis was ?rst produced by the Royal Court 
Jerwood Theatre Upstairs in London in June 2000. This 
was the last work of Kane’s, who, after a life-long battle with 
depression, hung herself with shoelaces in her hospital 
room a year before her play would be produced. This current 
production was in?uenced and shaped heavily by the real life 
experiences of Carnegie Mellon students through the Sarah 
Project, an initiative aimed at discussing issues of mental 
health through art.
From the moment the audience approaches the door to 
the studio, it is clear that production has taken a lot of care 
in engaging with material that can be mentally taxing on 
audiences. Outside the theater are posted several notices 
that warn patrons to practice self-care while watching the 
show. The notices also provide trigger warnings of sexual 
assault and suicide. These details, along with a message 
from CaPS on the door (echoed in an insert in the program), 
are indicative of these artists’ understanding of the play and 
its potential to take an emotional toll.
The play starts in darkness, and indeed in darkness is where 
Moriarty’s direction is the most effective. In darkness and 
silence we hear Ali Miller (Slone) enter her apartment and 
in darkness we hear her rape occur. This series of actions 
sets the tone for the 100-minute show as we see Ali struggle 
with the aftermath of her assault, both alone and with her 
doctor played by Fifer. There is so much that Moriarty’s 
production gets right depicting serious depression and the 
toll it takes on people. He not only touches on the sadness, 
but also on the anger that anyone who has struggled with 
depression or who has loved someone with depression is 
all too familiar with. At one point Ali echoes this feeling 
outright, “Depression is anger; it’s what you did, who was 
there, and what you’re blaming.” The credit goes as much to 
Slone, who is able to believably portray catatonic quiet and 
incurable rage with equal enthusiasm.
Brown’s set also contributes greatly to the experience closing 
the distance between audience and performer with his 
catwalk set. Ali’s apartment spans across the studio with 
audience sitting on either side. On one end of the set her 
bed and posters of various historical and ?ctional women like 
Audrey Hepburn, Marilyn Monroe, and Daenerys Targaryen. 
In the center, a desk with two cushions, and on the other 
side a door and several cork boards hung with bits of this and 
that, most notably a Carnegie Mellon ?ag. The effect makes 
it so that as an audience member you are watching other 
audience members as much as you are watching the action 
on stage. And as Ali makes several attempts throughout 
the show to connect with the audience members, at one 
pointing showing them a scribbled page from her diary and 
at various points making direct eye contact with people, 
the other side becomes a mirror equally implicit to Ali’s 
suffering and equally silent. The point is driven home when 
Ali pulls out a sweatshirt from Pi Kappa Alpha, a fraternity 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus. She could be any number of 
survivors walking by on our campus, reminding the audience 
that by doing nothing to stop the dangerous culture of sexual 
assault on campus we are almost as culpable as the attackers 
themselves.
While the play got so much right, as with art that attempts 
to grapple with complex issues, 4.48 falters in some respects. 
Fifer, though incredible in presence, isn’t really given much 
to do or say that wouldn’t have been just as organic coming 
from the mouth of Ali. Similarly, the way his relationship 
turns from professional to sexual and then to professional 
again sends some potentially harmful messages about how 
assault survivors can begin to heal. After an extended sex 
scene between the two characters, Slone’s Ali seems much 
more positive and only sets on the path to kill herself again 
when he then rejects her. This feels like the production 
is putting the healing of mental illness on the onus of the 
person’s loved ones, when anyone who’s had experience 
with this knows that mental illness can’t be loved away. 
Healing is an incredibly individualistic journey that loved 
ones can only support. It is worth mentioning however that 
the lead up to this sex scene was one of the best examples 
I’ve seen of using consent to initiate sexual contact. Multiple 
times we see Ali’s hand rest on an article of the doctor’s 
clothing, making eye contact with him and only removing 
the article after he nods yes.
4.48 Psychosis was an intense delve into one person’s 
struggle with depression. The production, and whatever 
else comes from the Sarah Project, is a welcome addition 
to a campus like Carnegie Mellon, where issues like sexual 
assault and mental illness are still ignored by much of the 
campus community.

4.48 Psychosis is haunting and poetic
The production, playing in the John Wells Studio, is a searingly brutal mediation on deppression
The Danish Girl is a biographical romantic drama based on a book of the same name, which is loosely based on the lives and marriage of Danish painters Lili Elbe and Gerda 
Wegener. Lili and Gerda’s marriage and work evolve as Lili undergoes sex reassignment surgery, setting her on a groundbreaking journey as one of the world’s transgender 
pioneers. The cast, led by Oscar-nominated Vikander and Redmayne, has been hailed as a revelation. Rotten Tomatoes says, “Vikander delves beneath the surface to explore a 
truly fascinating woman. And Redmayne is simply wonderful, totally convincing both as Einar and as the ‘Danish girl’ of the ?lm’s title.”

Romeo and Juliet may be his most famous, but 
Shakespeare’s ultimate tragic pair of star-crossed 
lovers are Antony and Cleopatra. Last weekend the 
Carnegie Mellon School of Drama staged a gripping 
re-imagining of the ancient tale of the powerful 
Roman general and enchanting Egyptian queen’s 
doomed love affair and placed it firmly within the 
racial tensions of present-day America. 
Adapted and directed by John Wells Directing Fellow 
Eleanor Bishop and senior acting major Chante 
Adams, who also portrayed Cleopatra, Antony and 
Cleopatra blended Shakespeare’s Elizabethan text 
with the words of black performers, thinkers, and 
activists to present a piece that dialogued with 
mixed issues of race and feminism. 
Featuring a strong ensemble cast that included 
junior musical theatre major Joseph Essig as Antony 
and junior musical theatre major Henry Ayres-
Brown as Antony’s rival for the emperor’s throne, 
Caesar, Antony and Cleopatra showcased the unique 
strengths of the school’s Studio 201 space on North 
Braddock avenue in Point Breeze and left audiences 
with plenty to ponder on the drive home.
Bishop and Adams’s adaptation did much to reorient 
the focus of the piece on Cleopatra herself, diluting 
Antony’s significance to a reference point for the 
piece’s commentary on interracial relationships. 
Cleopatra’s identity is established as exotic and 
“other” as the Egypt she rules when compared to the 
strict, white-bread world of Antony’s native Rome. 
Antony’s brief, politically motivated marriage to 
Caesar’s sister Octavia, played by senior acting 
major Cara Ronzetti, is mashed up with commentary 
from rapper Azealia Banks on white appropriation of 
hip-hop music and culture as well as the July Twitter 
exchange between Nicki Minaj and Taylor Swift 
over the former’s claim that the Video Music Awards 
nominations favored white female performers over 
black ones. 
Cleopatra’s slight becomes the slight of all black 
performers constantly suppressed by a culture that 
values their contribution but prefers they stay out of 
sight in favor of the “girl next door.” 
Another stirring combination came at the piece’s 
climax, with Cleopatra’s capture by Caesar playing 
out amidst a live performance of the audio taken from 
the violent arrest of Sandra Bland in July of last year 
over a moving violation. Bland was later found dead 
of apparent suicide in her jail cell, and Cleopatra’s 
suicide becomes the defiant stand of a culture 
decrying death before submission.
Compared to the grand proscenium of the Chosky 
Theater in Purnell, the Studio 201 space is 
immediate, and its bare-bones warehouse aesthetic 
gives the piece a gritty feel. The set is themed to 
give the impression the piece is a filming set for 
“Caesar productions,” and the action of the show was 
frequently interrupted by cries of “cut” or camera 
changes. 
Monitors flanking the stage depicted the star-
making view of the camera, which at times depicted 
Cleopatra and Antony as camera-hungry lovers à la 
Jay-Z and Beyoncé, and other times recast Octavia’s 
betrothal to Antony as a sexually-charged Taylor 
Swift music video. The production made smart use 
of multimedia to add extra layers to the fabric of the 
piece, leaving no stone unturned in the presentation 
of its discussion.
The cast was small, eight players in all, so each had 
to pull extra weight in playing multiple roles. Senior 
acting major Wesley Jones gave exuberant life to 
everyone from a Kanye West-inspired Pompey to 
Cleopatra’s servant Alexas and junior musical theatre 
major Arica Jackson inhabited Cleopatra’s servant 
Charmian as well as multiple voices on a Eugene 
Lang college panel, “Are You Still a Slave? Liberating 
the Black Female Body,” among others. It was 
ensemble acting at its finest.
Amidst headlines pronouncing massive protests in 
the wake of Beyoncé’s Super Bowl performance of 
“Formation” and the racial themes of its music video, 
the School of Drama’s adaptation of Antony and 
Cleopatra touched on discussions that are seeing 
mainstream sunlight. 
Adams concluded the piece with a painfully honest 
confession delivered directly to the audience, in 
which she revealed a childhood wish that she was 
a skinny white girl named Michelle. She faced the 
audience and admitted, to a mostly white audience, 
that she was taught to love them, but had to learn to 
love herself.
Antony and Cleopatra succeeded in its multi-textual 
approach to constructing a dynamic discussion on 
themes of race and feminism in modern America, 
and fits nicely in the School’s great season thus far.

**Warning: article contains spoilers**
For those who have lasted the past seasons of Grey’s 
Anatomy and feel like they have the emotional 
endurance to undergo more of what seems like endless 
heartbreak, I salute you. I’m not sure if it is the looming 
midterms, or just the general life panic of a college 
junior that puts me in a vulnerable mental space, but 
last Thursday’s mid-season premiere of Grey’s Anatomy 
on ABC had me raising my eyebrows and saying, “of 
course,” with a sigh that was both weary and skeptical.
For the past 11 seasons, show producer and creator 
Shonda Rhimes has guided her beloved Grey’s Anatomy 
characters through personal tragedy after personal 
tragedy. These have included, but are not limited to: 
blossoming romances killed in infancy, multiple cases 
of Alzheimer’s, car crashes, plane crashes, shootings, 
near-drownings, serious cancer diagnoses, miscarriages, 
amputations, and runaway spouses. Even for other, less 
tragic reasons, beloved characters have walked off the 
series, much to the bereavement of some of the show’s 
most ardent fans.
This past Thursday’s mid-season premiere was no 
different in terms of emotional content; however, Grey’s 
Anatomy fans are speaking out against it. In this 
episode, titled “The Sound of Silence,” titular character 
Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) is viciously attacked and 
assaulted by a car crash victim she is attempting to 
treat. 
In typical Grey’s Anatomy fashion, the other members 
of Rhimes’ diverse ensemble cast surround her bedside 
and rush to save her life, surrounded by the beeping 
noises and panic associated with only the most dire of 
Grey’s Anatomy emergencies.
This is repetitive not just for Grey’s Anatomy, but 
for Meredith Grey herself, who has suffered medical 
crises numerous times along with many other personal 
tragedies, the most recent of which was the death of her 
husband, Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey). Frantic 
fans feel that poor Meredith Grey has experienced 
enough. 
Actress Ellen Pompeo, however, addressed these 
concerns on a “ShondaLand Revealed” podcast, saying 
“You don’t think you’re going to have to come up 
with 12 years of devastating things happening to one 
character. However, I look at the news every day and 
read newspapers online, and people have had some 
pretty unfortunate series of events happen to them in 
life. Things that you never think would happen. People 
being at two different mass shootings. Random, weird 
things do happen. Earth is quite an interesting place. So 
we can always suspend our disbelief enough to be able 
to tell some story and learn some lessons.”
Though it is nice to hear Ellen Pompeo recognize that 
her character has been dealt a bad hand, I can’t help but 
wonder what lessons viewers experience by watching 
her — and her castmates to an extent — get repeatedly 
battered week after week. Lessons can be learned from 
coping, that’s irrefutable, but most of this show becomes 
about coping with loss. Watching this show now 
involves holding your breath week to week, waiting for 
an inevitable crisis.
Part of me is seriously concerned that Rhimes has 
sacri?ced conveying complex emotional lives for the 
more sure-?re and reliable emotional punch that these 
tragedies provide. As much as weeping during movies 
or television shows is therapeutic to me, I found myself 
questioning that on Thursday, thinking: does this alone 
make good television? How much more evidence of life’s 
impermanence do we need?
My impression, after having watched the episode, is 
that Grey’s Anatomy has perhaps reached the end of its 
tether as a show. Eleven seasons after its foundation, 
it seems that all the characters are working to move 
past a near continual set of tragedies. The show is 
still entertainment and, after all, that is its primary 
responsibility, but it’s hard to be willing to get very 
invested in a certain character only to have the rug 
pulled out from under them nearly constantly, and that 
ultimately diminishes the power of the stories these 
characters tell.
Rhimes shouldn’t be afraid to shake up the classic Grey’s 
Anatomy mold at this point. Change is dif?cult when 
there are such faithful fans, but it is worth a shot to save 
the show from ?oundering.
The mid-season premiere of Scandal and How To Get 
Away With Murder also aired Thursday night on ABC. 
These two shows, also run by Shonda Rhimes, both 
include a fantastic amount of tragedy. Though I’m not 
a Scandal fan, I am a huge HTGAWM fan, but unlike 
Grey’s Anatomy, the storyline only consists of characters 
avoiding conviction for crimes. Though in its infancy 
— this is HTGAWM’s second season — I worry that the 
show might eventually devolve into a caricature of itself, 
the way that the Rhimes-run medical drama has.
If Ellen Pompeo’s defense of Meredith Grey’s tragedy 
reminded me of anything, it’s that life includes great 
joys along with great horrors. And it seems that as 
Grey’s Anatomy progresses, the examination of these 
happinesses gets more and more cursory. But if life 
— and entertainment that seeks to explore, albeit 
in a fantastical way, the diversity of such a life — is 
an exercise in opposites, Grey’s Anatomy is very 
much weighted in the tragic direction, to the show’s 
detriment.

For its mid-season premiere, Grey’s Anatomy resorts to exaggerated tragedy once again
The cast of this popular drama have seen the departure of many beloved characters from the main cast,          
including Dr. Christina Yang (Sandra Oh), Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), Dr. George O’Malley (T.R. Knight), Dr. Isobel 
Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Dr. Lexie Grey (Chyler Leigh), and Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) — six of the 
eleven people pictured above. Of these six departures, four have died tragically over the course of the show.

Parental Process was a communication and print design exhibition at the 
Frame Gallery that ran from Feb. 19 to  Feb. 22, 2016. It attempted to 
emphasize the relevance of print in today’s digital world. It is described as 
“passively placed parallel print-objects paraphrasing printers’ panic. Planks, 
packages, pages, pairs, pans, and proud printing parents. Participate in 
public print.” Artists involved include: senior art major Max Gonzales and 
junior art majors Rachel Moeller, Jarel Grant, and Sandra Kang.
