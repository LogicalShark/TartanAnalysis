VARSITY HAS HARD SCHED­
ULE THIS WEEK.
With the opening of the basketball 
season last week, the popular winter 
sport is now in full sway here at Car­
negie, and at present occupies the 
center of the athletic stage. While 
the contests that were played did not 
terminate as favorably for us as might 
be wished, nevertheless they demon­
strated that we have some fine mate­
rial which with time can be moulded 
into a winning aggregation. We lost 
to Pitt, an excellent team, consisting 
of a galaxy of stars as were never 
before assembled by any college in 
this end of the state. Not discour­
aged in the least by this defeat, the 
team came back Saturday night and 
opened the home season with a vic­
tory over Geneva. As soon as things 
begin working smoothly and the team 
starts playing together, Carnegie will 
be on the long end of a lot of games, 
because this year’s team is a crowd 
of hard and earnest workers. At pres­
ent, the biggest need of the team is a 
good, consistent scoring forward. It 
is hoped that we will soon get one 
with the prospects of Crawford be­
ing declared eligible. “Bull” would 
just fill the gap and would round out 
the Tech aggregation into a very for­
midable quintet.
This week will be one of the hard­
est that the team will have during 
the entire season. Juniata, Marietta

Last Friday night Carnegie opened 
her basketball season in a game with 
Pitt in Trees Gymnasium, in which 
they were defeated 42 to 22. An ex­
traordinarily large crowd witnessed 
the contest and great enthusiasm was 
displayed on the part of the specta­
tors. The game was interesting from 
start to finish. From the showing 
made by both teams their possibili­
ties during the coming season were 
well indicated. The Plaid five, al­
though seemingly not quite up to 
form, gave promise of developing in­
to one of the strongest teams which 
has represented this institution. Pitt’s 
aggregation displayed excellent bas­
ketball and likewise it promises to 
be one of the best college teams.
The first half was especially inter­
esting but Pitt gained a small lead 
and held it throughout. During this 
period both teams displayed excellent 
team work, but the Blue and Gold 
seemed to have a little the better of 
the Plaid in this department of the 
game.
In the second half Pitt continued 
her consistent playing, while Car­
negie seemed to falter. For some rea­
son we were unable to carry the ball 
away from Pitt’s goal and break 
through their defense and score. Car­
negie was able to cage but three 
goals in the last portion of the game. 
However, she only missed dropping 
siveral shots through the basket by 
narrow margins.
Levy, of Carnegie, put up an ex­
cellent game, and displayed great 
ability. His shooting was excellent 
and he acquired four baskets for the 
Plaid. Hines acted captain and 
played well at guard.
Lubic, of Pitt, was an excellent foul 
shooter and dropped the ball through 
8 times in 12 tries. Graham, Heally 
and Matson showed much ability.
First Half.
Pitt started out with a rush and 
gained four points on Carnegie when 
Graham shot two field goals. Then 
Levy shot Carnegie’s first basket. 
Lubic made up for this by shooting a 
couple of fouls for the blue and gold. 
Levy added another pretty one when 
he jumped the ball in from below the 
basket. Heally, Graham and Matson 
earned Pitt six more points. Levy 
then caged his third goal. Hines, of 
Carnegie, dropped in a foul. Matson 
shot a couple more goals for Pitt.
Hines attempted a foul but it hit 
the rim of the basket and bounded to 
the floor. He followed up his shot,

OPENER AT HOME
however, and, recovering it, he landed 
a goal. Matson once more tossed one 
in and then Hines put it in from the 
foul line. Heally dropped in another 
one and Douthett repeated the feat 
for his own team. Lubic added a 
couple of points to Pitt’s score by 
putting the ball in twice on a double 
foul. Henning tossed one from the 
floor and Hines shot a foul. Lubic 
once more shot a double foul. . The 
period then ended with the score 26 
to 16 in favor of Pitt.
Second Half.
Hines opened the scoring with a 
goal for Carnegie. Then Hastings 
dropped one in. Lubic netted two 
more points on fouls. Hastings made 
a long toss for a goal. Ochenshirt 
scored one. Levy shot a foul and 
Hines caged one on a pretty shot 
from the floor. The Pitt captain then 
made another. Hastings and Carlson 
added four more points for Pitt.
Before the Pitt-Carnegie game in 
Trees Gymnasium last Friday night 
a most interesting preliminary was 
played in which the Pitt Freshmen 
defeated the Carnegie Plebes 40 to 26. 
The game was almost as exciting to 
watch as the big game, because of 
the excellent form shown by both 
fives.
Just as in the big game, the Plaid 
did most of her scoring in the first 
part of the game. In the later half 
they let up a little and the Pitt Fresh­
men widened their lead.
During the first few minutes of 
play neither team seemed to be able 
to go into the lead. The score was 
twice tie, then Carnegie finally gained 
a lead of two baskets on her oppon­
ents. Pitt quickly overcame this and 
Hines then shot a foul and McCul­
lough tossed the last goal. The final 
score: Pitt, 42; Carnegie, 22.

GENEVA DEFEATED, 
sstsuf
Carnegie won the second game of 
her basketball season on Saturday 
night when she defeated Geneva in 
an unusually close game, by the score 
of 22 to 20. The game was played 
on Carnegie’s floor and a large num­
ber of spectators were present to wit­
ness the contest. The unusual close­
ness of the game kept those who 
watched continually on edge and ex­
citement ran high at all times. No 
sooner would one team get ahead 
than the other would tie up the score 
again. In this manner the Plaid root­
ers were kept in constant fear of the 
outcome.
Both fives seemed to lack team 
work and many long floor passes 
were made. Carnegie guarded rather 
raggedly at times while Geneva 
seemed weak in shooting. But as a 
whole the game was a good one and 
hard fought from beginning to end.
Acting Captain Hines played a 
pretty defensive game and, in addi­
tion, shot a couple of baskets, thus 
proving his ability as a running guard. 
Meredith at center likewise put up a 
strong game and handled the ball 
cleverly. Perrot, of Geneva, played 
a great game at guard for his team, 
while McCarter likewise starred.
In the opening half, Carnegie took 
the lead' by shooting three fouls. Ge­
neva tied the score at 6 to 6, how­
ever. Both teams scored before the 
end of the half and the final score 
was an 8 to 8 tie.
In the second half Slater and 
Green went in for Carnegie, and, 
although new men, they displayed 
some promising basketball talent. 
Geneva started the scoring and things 
were nip and tuck for awhile with 
the brown in the lead by a single 
point. A goal by Meredith put the 
single point lead on our own score, 
however, and from that time on the 
Plaid kept ahead by a small margin.
First Half.
Hines started the scoring by drop­
ping in three fouls. McCarter shot 
a foul and then Hines added another 
to his list. In a double foul McCar­
ter put his shot in while Hines failed. 
McCarter tossed in another foul. 
Meredith made the first field goal and 
McCarter shot another one immedi­
ately after, leaving the Plaid one point 
ahead. This the Geneva star easily 
overcame by popping in another one 
from the foul line. Douthett made a

We note from the Graduate Maga­
zine of the University of Kansas that 
their Board of Administration has a 
recommendation from the League of 
Kansas Municipalities to establish a 
course of training for city officials or 
for young men who wish to go into 
municipal work. Such a course would 
include subjects such as Economics, 
Political Science, City Government 
and Engineering which would give 
the student a broad understanding of 
such work as is handled by a Depart­
ment of Public Works. In view of 
what has happened in the administra­
tion of our city government in the last 
few years, wouldn’t a man with such 
training be valuable in a city position? 
At Tech, we have a Faculty which 
could with some adjustment handle 
such a course and it would seem to 
us that the training offered would ap­
peal to young men throughout the 
country. Why could not Tech get th^ 
“jump” on the other schools anfl in­
stitute a course in Municipal Engi­
neering?

A new arrival in the literary and 
journalistic field at Carnegie made its 
appearance last week entitled “The 
Bagpipe,” a paper devoted to matters 
of interest and pertaining to the In­
dustry School. The tone and style 
of the material printed was excellent, 
several cuts were included, and the 
workmanship was faultless. The Tar­
tan congratulates the editors on the 
success of their first issue. We wTish 
for them in the future all of our suc­
cesses and none of our mistakes and 
troubles.
ebbR MJIL SERVIVEf
Several complaints have recently 
been registered against thè mail serv­
ice within the schools. Letters sent 
from one building to another require 
two or three days to reach their des­
tination. The present system is in­
efficient, to put it mildly, due in a 
large measure we believe to an in­
sufficient number of employes. The 
mail should be collected in the morn­
ings at stated intervals and delivered 
on the afternoon of the day of col­
lection, while letters mailed in the aft­
ernoons should be delivered not later 
than the morning after posting. When 
it takes longer to send a letter from 
the Central Building to the Industries 
Building than it does to send one 
from Pittsburgh to New York, the 
need for immediate improvement 
should be clearly evident.

Editor of The Tartan:
Without under-estimating the 
claimed merits of the so-called Honor 
System, I think, however, that the fol­
lowing quotation from the current 
Educational Review may add some hu­
mor to the situation:
“PROPOSED HONOR SYSTEM 
PLEDGE 
“I was born of honest parents. I 
was raised the same way. I have 
neither looked to right nor left. I 
have stuffed cotton in my ears, and 
kept it there all the time. My clothes 
have no pockets. This is straight on 
the level bona fide truth.—Take it or 
leave it!
“The agitators expect to continue 
their campaign until they succeed.” 
Personally, I believe that the above 
quotation expresses in a nut-shell the 
honor system to be formally intro­
duced at Carnegie.
Yours sincerely,

Editor of the Tartan:
What has happened to the maga­
zines and periodicals of the Science 
club room? Has the committee taken 
a vacation, or is it merely waiting to 
make a good start next fall?
During the year 1913-14 we had 
plenty of good reading and the com­
mittee deserves praise, especially for 
its attempt to bind same magazines.
So far, there have been no maga­
zines this school year, and the only 
literature—outside of the “heavy read­
ing” in the study room—consists of 
the remnants of 1913-12-11. This 
statement is not absolutely true, for, 
a week or so before Christmas vaca­
tion there appeared three weekly 
papers and about a dozen college 
papers. It ought also to be said that 
every now and then a morning paper 
appears.
What has been the result? Instead 
of spending some of our spare time
reading the latest scientific news, we 
have all turned to playing “500”. At 
one time there were as many as six 
“500” games, and if there had been any 
more decks of cards there would have 
been a dozen games. Of course, there 
is no harm in “500”. But compare 
this year’s with last year’s club room.
Very seldom was there a game of 
cards seen then. Who wouldn’t 
rather read “Puck” or “Judge” in ten 
minutes’ spare time, than rush around 
trying to find a hole at a card table?
The club room committee hasn’t 
been keeping up to its standard. If 
this work takes up too much of the 
committee’s time, why doesn’t it say 
so? Surely, there can be no other 
reason for the non-appearance of read­
ing matter.

A supplement to the old Student 
Handbook was issued to the students 
last week. This book contains all the 
changes in schedules of athletic teams, 
and their records for the past year. 
It also contains the names of all the 
new organizations which have made 
their appearance since the issuing of 
the last book, as well as the names of 
all the new class and club officers.
Students may obtain copies of the 
Supplement by either applying to Mr.

At the Forty-eighth Annual Con­
vention of the American Institute of 
Architects, their Committee on Edu­
cation recommended that the gradu­
ates of the School of Applied Design 
holding a degree diploma be admitted 
to membership in the Institute with­
out further requirements. The fol­
lowing is an extract from the report 
of the Committee which visited the 
school some time ago.
“At the invitation of the School of 
Architecture of the Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, the Chairman spent a 
day in Pittsburgh visiting that school. 
The school is lodged in the Fine Arts 
Building, which it shares with the 
schools of Painting, Sculpture, Music 
and the Drama. Physically the school 
is equipped as well as any in the coun­
try today, and when the present addi­
tions are completed, the building will 
be as fine as any that we know of. 
The advantage of all the arts being 
Under the same roof, is self-evident. 
Collaboration on a scale that is im­
possible elsewhere, is encouraged. In 
that most charming of little theatres, 
are given performances of plays writ­
ten and acted by the students, set to 
music written and executed by them, 
and in costumes designed by them. 
The scenery is of course also home­
made. The inspiration resulting from 
such opportunities must patently be 
very great.
“The School of Architecture has es­
tablished a certain fixed quantity of 
work which each student must do to 
become eligible for a degree. This 
can be accomplished generally in four 
years. The length of time spent in 
the accomplishment of the required 
work, however, has no bearing on the 
degree. Under this system, a student 
may accomplish his college course 
while actively working in an office.
“In the matter of making, judg­
ments the school has adopted the jury 
system for the free hand and life 
drawing, water color and modelling. 
The professors of the allied schools 
participate in the judgments and con­
sequently the professors’ personal 
knowledge of and possible prejudice 
for, his pupil, can have no unfair in­
fluence.
“All architectural design is done 
under the auspices of the Society of 
Beaux Arts Architects of New York. 
Their programmes, as issued, are ac­
cepted as the school’s, and all draw­
ings are sent to New York for judg­
ment, the ranking of the drawings by 
the Society’s jury being accepted as 
final by the school. Consequently the 
Society assists in the giving of degrees 
in this very important school. We 
believe the system as adopted to be 
fundamentally sound. It should make 
the Beaux Arts Society look twice at 
the personnel of its juries and the 
composition of its programmes.”
It is a pleasure for the Faculty, the 
students and friends of the Institute 
to know that the school is receiving 
recognition for the splendid work that 
it is doing. There is no question but 
that careful work turned out at the 
Design School is on a par with that 
of any similar institution in the coun­
try.

Among the new students registered 
last week for the mid-winter and 
spring terms, was Walter C. Bauer, 
of Elizabeth, N. Jf, who has been lo­
cated at the Signal Corps Aviation 
School at San Diego, Cal., as an aero­
nautical engineering expert. He comes 
to Tech as a special student to do re­
search work in the field of high 
strength steels as applied to aeronau­
tical engineering. Bauer has had some 
thrilling experiences while testing 
aeroplane motors under actual run­
ning conditions, and tells of one oc­
casion when “pancaked” with a young 
army lieutenant, who, for the moment 
lost control of his machine. “Pancak­
ing” in the parlance of the birdman, 
is to turn turtle, and it occurs most 
frequently when a landing is being 
made. Upon this occasion the land­
ing was being made in the dark, and 
fortunately, the young lieutenant lost 
control when he was only a few feet 
from the ground, so that no injuries 
were sustained by him or Bauer.
“There is no American built aero­
plane motor,” says Bauer, “that is not 
vitally weak in some part.” This can­
not be said of foreign makes and it 
is his belief that it is on account of 
the greater advancement that has been 
made broad in the field of metallurgy.

Slater, of Carnegie, put up the best 
game, and was the most dependable 
man on the team. His foul shooting 
was good, especially in the first half. 
Craig also did some excellent work 
at center, and was one of Carnegie’s 
leading scorers. Davis, of Pitt, was 
an excellent shooter, and caged five 
goals. Nicholas likewise earned five

With much regret has the student 
body learned that Miss Frances Hig­
gins, professor of psychology, and 
head of the department for Training 
of Teachers, will not be with us after 
this semester.
Miss Higgins came to us three 
years ago from Alabama, her home, 
where she had been engaged in do­
ing field work for the Department of 
Education for the State.
During Miss Higgins’ first year at 
Margaret Morrison she assisted Di­
rector Hamerschlag as Dean of the 
school, and from the first won the 
love and esteem of the girls.
As an instructor Miss Higgins has 
been invaluable, and the students 
feel that they are losing a priceless 
teacher and a sincere friend. The en­
tire school regrets that it is neces­
sary for Miss Higgins to leave, and 
she will long be remembered by the 
girls in Margaret Morrison.

On Wednesday afternoon, Decem­
ber 16th, the Margaret Morrison 
girls celebrated the coming holidays 
with an entertainment, the like of 
which had never been known before 
in the history of our school.
At three-thirty every girl in the 
school from the most exalted senior 
to the most insignificant plebe, went 
to the recreation room to enjoy the 
fun. An invitation had been ex­
tended to all members of the faculty 
and our other friends in our imme­
diate school.
A large Christmas tree had been 
placed in the front part of the hall, 
which was marked off for a stage, 
upon which the afternoon festivities 
took place. The tree was beautifully 
decorated, and gave a decided spirit 
to the occasion.
The first thing on the program was 
the Boar’s Head Procession. This 
has been a part of every Christmas 
entertainment given in Margaret Mor­
rison. The upper-classmen thought 
it would be advisable to revive the 
custom this year. After the proces­
sion, a number of Christmas carols 
were sung.
The next on the program was the 
presentation of “An Upper Class­
man’s Nightmare.” Lu M. Hartman, 
of the Senior class, as representative 
of the true upper classman, was the 
dreamer, and took her part splen­
didly. The following girls took part 
in the presentation of the nightmare, 
and impersonated some member of 
the faculty. Grace Searight, ’16, as 
Dean Breed; Mary Loomis ’16, as 
Miss Lyon; Marjorie Northrop ’15, 
as Miss Hayden; Mile. Kern ’15, as 
Miss Collet; Marion Pichel ’16, as 
Prof. Rush; Lorna Williams ’15, as 
Prof. Day; Lydia Bates ’15, as Miss 
Merrill; Charlotte Watson ’16, as Mrs. 
Morrow; Sara Wolfe ’16, as Miss 
Parry; Hazel Freeland ’15, as Miss 
Kinman; Marguerite Spilman ’15, as 
Miss Higgins; Blanche Booth ’16, as 
Miss Stoner, and Sara Murray ’15, as 
as Miss More.
Fourteen Sophomores draped in 
white with large black letters painted 
on their backs, grouped themselves 
around the dreaming student so as 
to spell the words, “Special Methods.” 
Directly after Miss Pichel’s imperso­
nation of Prof. Rush, the Senior quar­
tette glided upon the stage and bend­
ing over Miss Hartman sang the fol­
lowing bacteriological ditty to the 
tune of the Amici chorus:
“Coccaceae, bactereaceae, spirocheate 
Flagella used for feet 
Shall be found gram positive 
When we with stain do treat.”
After this the Plebes gave some 
clever impersonations of the upper 
classmen, and following this, Santa 
Claus appeared head and shoulders 
above a chimney which had been 
erected in a corner opposite the 
Christmas tree.
Each girl and each instructor had 
a small gift somewhere around the 
tree. Tied to the gift was a short 
poem or note for the person which 
added to the originality.
Marion Pichel, president of the 
Dramatic Club, was Santa Claus, and

A rousing and inspiring address by 
Dean Connelly, a convincing heart- 
to-heart talk by Mr. Jonas, city edi­
tor of the Leader, glad-hand saluta­
tions by members of the Faculty, 
Messrs. Calderwood, Dodds and 
Ward, a series of moving pictures, 
songs, stories and personal experi­
ence confidences by members of the 
various classes and not a single un­
pleasant feature constituted the pro­
gram of the regular Fall Term Ban­
quet of the Night Electric Wiring and 
Telephone classes, held Friday night, 
December 18th, in the Duquesne 
Hotel.
Mr. Jonas presented a three reel 
film lecture on the “Making of g 
Modern Newspaper,” featuring the 
Pittsburgh Leader plant. Mr. C. W. 
Ward, superintendent of the Du­
quesne Light Company’s Laboratory, 
lectured on the laying of a high ten­
sion cable across the Ohio river at 
Brunot’s Island, illustrated by a film 
and one of the C. I. T. films show­
ing field sports and life at the Camp 
Louise Carnegie was shown.
Oh, yes! the eats! In the hotel’s 
best style they were served, and in 
one, two, three order, they disap­
peared. It was great, but they always 
are successful, for the Night Wiring 
bunch are the original “live wires.” 
J. J. Clarke, (Scotty) did the honors 
as toastmaster, although some 
thought it should be roastmaster. The 
honorable committeemen, who work­
ed hard and successfully,-were Messrs. 
Lappe and Davis, representing the A 
class; Cook and Loos, the B class; 
Peets and Smith, the C. class; and 
Brantigam and Walker the D class.
A similar event is scheduled for 
the Spring term.
CARNEGIE PLAYS JUNIATA
Coniinued from Page 1 
and Muskingum will be met on Thurs­
day, Friday and Saturday nights re­
spectively. We will play Juniata on 
our home floor while the latter two 
teams will be met abroad. Last year 
we lost twice to Juniata, the first time 
on our floor by a 40-31 score and 
then later at Huntington by a tally 
of 33 to 28. Both games were close 
and exciting, in fact we had the first 
contest practically won until one E. 
Landis (present coach of the Pitt 
Freshmen) entered the game in the 
second half. What he did with our 
hopes is a shame to say, because he 
only negotiated nine field goals in 
the short time of twenty minutes; 
and it was said that he possessed a 
failing heart. We wonder what would 
have happened if this lad had been 
in perfect health and had played an 
entire game against us. Luckily for 
us, Mr. Landis will not be in the line­
up this year, so we can readily con­
cede ourselves a chance to win. Car­
negie hopes to get revenge for ljast 
year’s double defeat. Furthermore, 
the dope is also in our favor because
last year when we played three 
games in a row in two different occa­
sions, we won the first game both 
times and by overwhelming scores. 
A dance will be held after the game 
which will start at 8:15.
Last year’s games with Marietta 
and Muskingum were both victories 
for Tech, the former by a 27-26 score 
after ten minutes extra play, and the 
latter 39-27. Muskingum had the 
Championship team of Ohio last year 
and they have quite a few of their 
stars back, so we will have to play 
a fast game to repeat. Both teams 
appear later in the season at the Field 
House.
¡Now remember the facts, fellows; 
tonight, Thursday, at the Field 
House, Tech against Juniata, at 8:15, 
and a dance after the game. Help 
the team along by your support, be­
cause a close game is expected, and 
every bit of encouragement from the 
student body will help toward a vic­
tory. Don’t desert the team because 
they lost to Pitt; better days are com­
ing if you will come out and help 
make them. Spare an hour or two 
tonight from your studies and come 
out and take a little lung exercise. 
It will be time well spent.

The “Safety First” movement, which 
originally began in Germany, has 
been advancing very rapidly in this 
country during the past few years, 
partly because manufacturers have 
had time to safeguard machinery and 
organize campaigns, where in busy 
times production was the moving 
spirit of their organizations; and part­
ly due to a desire on their part to 
cut down operating expenses, no small 
part of which has been that set aside 
for accident indemnity, lawsuits, etc. 
Many state legislatures have passed 
rigid compensation acts and this has 
had a great deal to do with furthering 
the movement for greater industrial 
safety.
Authorities differ as to the exact 
percentage of accidents due to care­
lessness of the workmen but it is safe 
to say that 75 per cent of all accidents 
are chargeable to this source. It has 
been the experience of some large cor­
porations that money spent for safe 
guarding machinery is wasted unless 
an active campaign of education of the 
employee is carried on. The Illinois 
Steel Company found that the per­
centage of accidents actually increased 
after machinery was protected; while 
naturally it was expected to decrease. 
The educational work in promoting 
safety is therefore the most important 
branch; and it is carried on by pub­
licity methods similar to trade adver­
tising.
Where a plant employs a fairly large 
percentage of the workers in a city it 
is easy to obtain space in the news­
papers as they are generally glad to 
print anything of interest and having 
a real news value regarding the in­
dustrial life of the city. The work­
men will also read such articles with 
more interest when they see the name

Immediately following the Pitt 
game last Friday, it was announced 
that A. S. Hines, right guard on the 
Varsity basketball team, had been 
duly elected captain for the coming 
year in place of J. P. Tumpane. “Pick” 
has played two years on the team 
and has always been a brilliant per­
former. Besides being on the bas­
ketball team, Hines pitches for the 
baseball nine, is secretary of the 
Board of Control, and a member of 
the Executive Committee. He is a 
Junior in the Civil Engineering 
course, and an officeholder of the 
class. Best wishes, “Pick”; we hope 
you will lead a victorious team.

Thomas Wood Stevens of the De­
partment of the Drama in the Design 
School filled the Wednesday morn­
ing lecture hour in room 209 Science, 
January 6th, with an intensely inter­
esting account of the great St. Louis 
pageant written and staged by him 
last year in the Missouri city. In in­
troducing the speaker, Director Ham- 
erschlag spoke of the recent ill­
ness of Dean Leete; and requested 
that the boys save him as much as 
possible during the coming month. 
He also announced that the next 
speaker would be President Wing of 
Western Reserve University, who is 
regarded as the best speaker among 
college Presidents today.
After extending an invitation to the 
students to attend a performance of 
Iphigenia of Tauris, and comment­
ing upon the Drama School seeming­
ly going into the movie business as 
the announcement of moving pictures 
of the pageant would seem to indi­
cate, the speaker began his subject, 
Dramatic Engineering, which is what 
the pageant really was,—a gigantic 
piece of dramatic engineering. He 
said in part:
“The problem of the pageant was 
to give a dramatic history of the city, 
and then in a masque reinterpret it 
as events of world significance. I 
will have to go back in the history 
of St. Louis. Ten years ago it put 
through a big world’s fair, and there 
had been nothing doing since. It had 
had a series of failures in Municipal 
government betterment. The men 
engineered the World’s Fair were 
tired; they felt that they had done 
enough. Attempts to secure a new 
charter had failed.
“There is one bridge at St. Louis 
which is a toll one. There is another 
one which was built by the city and 
was to be free, but after the bridge 
had been put across the Mississippi 
at enormous cost, it was never finish­
ed and stuck out on the Illinois side 
with no approach. If you wanted to 
make any one in St. Louis mad, all 
you had to do was to ask them where 
the other end of the bridge was.
“In St. Louis there is a younger set 
of people who tried the most improb­
able way of getting the people to­
gether by giving a pageant. Here in 
St. Louis is a great natural amphi­
theater where one quarter of the town 
can come. In the bottom of the site 
was ample room for an immense 
stage with a lagoon one hundred and 
fifty feet wide separating it from the 
three slopes of the hills.
“The problem was nothing more 
than to shape to this site a play which 
would make the people get together, 
and to realize that they had an en­
tity. Altogether we set out to make 
a play that would last three hours. 
Really it lasted four and a half 
hours.
“The history of St. Louis is fairly 
simple. You start out with the mound
builders about which you know two 
things; first, that they built mounds 
and buried their chiefs in them, 
and second, that they lived by 
agriculture. Then we have the ex­
ploration by La Salle, the settlement 
by the French, the transfer to Spain 
and the period of Spanish governors, 
then the sale to the United States 
along with the Louisiana Purchase 
and its history up to the Civil War.
“We built a stage as small as we 
could. It was almost nine hundred 
feet on the front, and a character had 
to be moved a hundred feet to be 
noticeable, so you may imagine the 
kind of emotions that require a move­
ment of a hundred feet are pretty 
large. The problem became one of 
fitting to this enormous stage the 
everyday happenings of the city.
“On each corner of the stage there 
was a forty-five foot tower of four 
stories and open at the back. These 
had in them the telephones, lighting 
equipment, and signal apparatus. 
There was a row of footlights in front 
of the stage, another across the one 
hundred and fifty foot lagoon, and 
eight hundred feet away a battery of 
search lights on the Museum. The 
lighting was gaudy to say the least. 
Fifteen thousand dollars were spent 
in temporary equipment.
“On a stage of this size it took five 
to six hundred people to be noticea- 
able, so that about six or seven thou­
sand people were needed. To obtain 
these, cards bearing lots of informa­
tion were distributed broadcast. In 
this way about seventy-five hundred 
people promised to take part. I said 
that they wouldn’t come to practice, 
but when two hundred and seventy- 
five out of three hundred and fifty 
came to the first rehearsal, I knew 
that I was mistaken and that there 
would be people enough. The crowds 
came to rehearsal; but the principals 
wouldn’t, they were too good to prac­
tise with the common crowd. Soon 
the crowds got to know each other; 
‘Hello, Pageant’ being enough intro­
duction on any street of the town. 
The other ones were easily recog­
nized, wearing nothing to speak of 
except red paint, so that they soon 
became very familiar with each other.
“The problem of scenery was a 
new one for nothing could be brought 
out on the stage during the perform­
ance, it all had to be there at the start. 
The trees used for the mound builders 
had three sides folded back, which 
spread out to make houses for the 
settlers. The audience rather liked 
this; they wondered what all those 
trees would be finally.
“We had it printed on the program 
that whenever chimes sounded, it in­
dicated the passing of years. As soon 
as one scene reached its climax, chimes 
sounded and the scene was unfocused, 
while a character detached himself 
from the one group starting another.
“Half of the seats were free, num­
bering 22,500; and these were sure to 
be full. The capacity of all the seats 
and the hill behind was estimated to 
be about one hundred thousand. The 
afternoon of the first performance it 
rained all afternoon, but thousands of 
people came. We announced to the 
big crowd that if it stopped raining
by 7:15, the show would play. It 
stopped for about two minutes, and 
then came down in torrents; but the 
show went on for three scenes until 
some ladies in good dresses were on, 
and they refused to go any farther. 
The next night the crowd could not 
be held, and we know that there was 
over one hundred thousand persons 
there.
“The new city charter was granted 
four weeks after the pageant, and the 
council approved plans for finishing 
the bridge three weeks later.”

The students of the department of 
drama repeated the production of the 
old Greek play, “Iphigenia in Taurus” 
last Thursday afternoon in the De­
sign Theater. Miss Margaret Anglin, 
star of “Lady Windermere’s Fan,” 
and her company were the guests of 
honor.
Miss Anglin has a deep interest in 
Greek drama, having herself inter­
preted the classic roles in the Cali­
fornia Theater. She was very much 
pleased with the performance, and 
gave her opinions concerning the dra­
matic student of today.
In speaking about the modern 
actor, Miss Anglin said, “The very 
best opportunity for stage success 
comes through such all-round train­
ing as this department of dramatic 
art aims to give. The aspiring actor 
has a far better chance to make good 
after thorough preparation here than 
by getting in the chorus of some big 
production, or in a small part in some 
road company and hoping to work 
up. You students are getting a foun­
dation here that years of stage ex­
perience might not give.” She also 
spoke about the costumes, and when 
told that the students studied and 
constructed all their costumes she 
was surprised.
After the performance an informal 
reception was held, attended by the 
students in their costumes. It is the 
aim and desire of the department to 
produce their plays before the artists 
of the day so as to benefit both stu­
dents and the work.

On Friday, January 8, 1915, the first 
meeting of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology, Economic Society, was 
held in Machinery Hall. The first 
business transacted was the election 
of officers. The election resulted in 
the following: President, H. Hore-
lick; vice president, M. Resnick; sec- 
retary-treasurer, M. Wohlgemuth.
The charter from the central organ­
ization has been received and contains 
the name of the charter members of 
the Carnegie Branch. The organiza­
tion is open for any one in school who 
desires to join a body of students for 
the purpose of discussing different as­
pects of Socialism.
There will be no regular meetings 
until the beginning of next semester, 
the official organization starting at 
that date. Any meetings to be held 
until that time will be announced by 
the President whenever necessary.
Any one wishing to join the Branch 
may have all particulars by applying 
to the secretary, M. Wohlgemuth, 
Junior Electrical.
The Department of Metallurgy and 
Mining has recently received from 
Bosch and Lomb Company a new 
microscope with attachments for mak­
ing photo-micrographs. The instru­
ment was designed by Professor Fred 
McIntosh of the department and its 
special application is the study of the 
micro-structure of opaque substances 
such as metals, ores and rocks. The in­
strument differs from the LeChaletier 
and Martin’s model in that it is the 
direct instead of the inverted type.
At this time a most interesting note 
is that it is a “Made in America” in­
strument.

Professor Willibald Trinks, a non- 
Socialist, spoke at the Socialistic 
meeting, held in the Lyceum Theater 
last Sunday. His subject was, “Two 
Thousand Years of Machinery.” In 
this he traced the development of 
machinery from the crude and simple 
machinery of antiquity to the won­
derfully complicated and almost hu­
man ones of today. The lecture was 
illustrated by lantern slides. Profes­
sor Trinks is head of the Department 
of Mechanical Engineering in the 
School of Applied Science, and is an 
authority on machine design, espe­
cially in the line of heavy duty rolling 
mill machinery.

Professor Henry Hornbostel spoke 
to the students of the Design School 
Friday noon and after a few words 
of personal advice, enunciated his 
views as to the use of the “movie” as 
an educator; such, he stated, being 
peculiarly true in the teaching of 
architecture. Calling to the mind of 
his audience the inherent visual quali­
ties of the motion picture, he pre­
sented an idea valuable in itself. Mr 
Hornbostel stated that it was his firm 
belief that within the course of but a 
few years, the motion picture ma­
chine would become a more valuable 
adjunct to the teaching of the devel­
opment of architecture than any sin­
gle method now used. This asser­
tion arising from so fertile a brain 
leads us to consider the possibilities 
of the picture machine, not only as 
a mode of architectural teaching, but 
also as an important factor in numer­
ous branches of instruction.
Let us recall to mind the effect of 
the photo play, today so common, 
upon an audience. Take, for example 
“Les Miserables,” as Mr. Hornbostel 
suggested. It presents all the pas­
sions, joys and sorrows of life in such 
an acute , manner as to cause crowds 
to weep, laugh and rejoice as the play 
progresses. Recall how the eight- 
reel photo play of “Ivanhoe” inspires 
us with its lifelike presentation of 
tournaments, minstrels, knights and 
ladies.
Any device which exerts so marked 
an effect upon the emotions of an 
audience is bound to be lasting and 
to undergo many transformations, 
emerging finally in the form of an 
educator of supreme stability.

HEALTH STATISTICS.
An analysis of the cases which came 
under the notice of the Student’s 
Health Department during the months 
of November and December, 1914, re­
veals interesting facts, a knowledge 
of which, if brought to the attention 
of the student body, might help to im­
prove the state of general health 
which, on the whole, this year, has 
not been bad.

Consulted Dr. Marks.

following schools:
Science Industries Design
Plebes ........ 876822
Sophomores 32362
Juniors .... 1614
Seniors .... 1077
14511145
Subdivided into their different cate­
gories, these 301 cases show that 
54 students suffered from Sprains and 
Contusions 
45 students suffered from Boils 
20 students suffered from Abcesses 
34 students suffered from Tonsilitis
24 students suffered from Colds
19 students suffered from Defective 
Eyes
7 students suffered from Skin Erup­
tions
98 students suffered from 20 different 
diseases, none of which, but two 
cases of Appendicitis (operated) 
one case of Scarlet Fever, and one 
case of Rheumatism, all followed
by recovery, have necessitated ces­
sation of class work for more than 
2 or 3 days.
Taking into consideration only the 
203 cases mentioned in detail, we find 
that 43.6 per cent of them (Sprains, 
Abcesses, Eyes), can be looked upon 
as accidental.
Thirty-two per cent (Tonsilitis, 
Colds, Skin Eruptions) are susceptible 
of prevention through consistent hy­
gienic care.
Boils, 22 per cent are met with in 
all schools, especially during the foot­
ball season and may be due to a di­
versity of causes among which diet, 
field dirt, gymnasium dust, bath 
towels may be mentioned. A bacteri­
ological investigation has been started 
by the Health Department in Decem­
ber with a view of eliminating and 
ascertaining possible causative factors 
and, if possible, of decreasing in the 
future the number of such cases.
The disproportion in the number of 
ill students in the three men’s schools 
ceases to exist if one takes into con­
sideration the difference in the num­
bers of enrolled students in these re­
spective schools.
The Plebes in all schools claim the 
larger number of consultations be­
cause:
1st. The number of lower classmen 
is greater than that of Sophomores or 
Juniors or Seniors.
2nd. Away from home frequently 
for the first time, having to reorganize 
their mode of living, subjected to fre­
quently remarkable climatic condi­
tions, entering new and arduous work, 
they not uncommonly expend during 
their first months at school, an 
amount of nervous energy which may 
lower their normal resistance.
In conclusion it may be said that 
though the Student’s health so far, 
this year, has been satisfactory, much 
better results could be shown by the 
Department, much time and worry 
saved by the student if the elementary 
principles of personal hygiene, (es­
pecially those applying to nose, 
throat, intestinal tract) were lived up 
to as rigorously as experience de­
mands.

PUBLICITY METHODS
Continued from Page 5 
of their employer in print. Such ar­
ticles should be so written as to arouse 
curiosity and make every one ask 
questions; and, if handled right, can 
not fail to result in a better spirit of 
co-operation among the workmen to 
make their plant as safe as possible.
Another very effective means of 
keeping up interest, is the Safety 
Score Board, which creates a friendly 
rivalry among departments to see who 
will have the cleanest score, and con­
sequently the fewest accidents. In the 
plant with which the writer is con­
nected, we have a total of about twen­
ty-six departments, each under a fore­
man and consisting of from six to one 
hundred and twenty-five men. These 
departments together with the names 
of the foremen are posted on the score 
board. Opposite each foreman’s 
name are four spaces, two for per­
centages and two for rank for both the 
month and the year. Of course, some 
departments have greater hazards 
than others; but, in a plant employing 
less than 1,000 men it only serves to 
complicate matters to attempt to 
make any difference in calculating the 
score, which is obtained as follows: 
For every man at work each day the 
department is credited with one unit 
known as the “Man-Day.” When a 
man is injured and unable to work, 
one man-day is charged against the 
department for each day that he is 
absent from work. At the end of 
the month and year the total number 
of man-days lost is subtracted from 
the total working man-days, and the 
remainder is divided by the original 
number. This gives a percentage fig­
ure. The foreman having the highest 
percentage has rank Number 1, etc. 
Sometimes a money prize is awarded 
for the highest percentage although 
we have not found it necessary in our 
plant, as yet. We find that foremen 
and workmen are intensely interested 
in keeping a good record and that no 
incentive is necessary.
We have found that the shop de­
partment bulletin board has been a 
great help in spreading information 
relative to methods of preventing ac­
cidents and showing what other 
plants are doing along this line. Most 
of the printed matter posted on our
25 Bulletin Boards is obtained from 
the National Safety Council of which 
body our Company is a member. Some 
care should be exercised in posting 
pictures or printed warnings as they 
might not apply to conditions in some 
departments. Our bulletins are 
changed regularly every Monday 
morning. They are collected by the 
shop messenger service and brought 
in to the desk of the Safety Inspector 
who notes on the back of the sheet 
to which department he wishes to as­
sign it for that week. These notes 
serve to show in what departments it 
has been shown, and so prevent post­
ing the same bulletin twice in the 
same place. The men learn to watch 
for something new every week, and 
in this way the subject of Safety First 
is kept constantly alive in their minds.
At each of the two entrances to our 
plant we have a small locked box for 
safety suggestions. Once a month we
send out with the pay checks, a note 
calling attention to safety in general 
and urging the men to make sugges­
tions on this same sheet and drop 
them into the boxes. These boxes 
are opened, the suggestions looked 
over by the Safety Inspector and in 
some cases, he questions the man of­
fering a suggestion to make sure that 
all points are clear. These sugges­
tions are then brought before the 
General Safety Committee by the In­
spector and are submitted to a vote. 
The writer of the suggestion which 
meets with the favor of the commit­
tee is awarded a prize of five dollars 
and that amount is added to his next 
pay. This is done every month and 
the suggestions submitted thus far 
have covered almost every possible 
chance for an accident. Most of them 
are acted upon immediately, if the 
work is not too expensive, and this 
action shows the men that their efforts 
for greater safety are being heeded.
We have numerous signs through­
out the plant calling attention to dan­
gerous points and also to Safety First 
simply as a motto. However, these 
signs are soon un-noticed by the work­
men unless they are kept bright and 
clean. Their effect on safety inspec­
tors is perhaps more favorable than 
on any one else.
Regarding the construction of these 
signs; it is not necessary to employ 
a regular sign painter as any good 
draughtsman can lay out the letters 
on detail paper and a stencil can be 
made from the paper which will last 
for a hundred signs. Contrasting col­
ors should be used so that the words 
will show up well. White letters on 
a brilliant red or dull black back­
ground have been found most satis­
factory.
In conclusion, perhaps a few words 
as to the results accomplished in our 
plant, employing about 800 men, would 
show what organized safety work will 
do.
The Safety Committee, composed of 
the main department heads, was or­
ganized October 14th, 1913. The first 
good results were apparent November 
10th, 1913, or a little less than a month 
later. For the eight months preceding 
the organization of this committee 
we had an average of over 14 acci­
dents per month with an average 
monthly compensation amounting to 
$252.15. For the four months after 
the organization date we had an aver­
age of 12 accidents with a compensa­
tion of $118.40 per month. From Jan­
uary 1st, 1913, to April 1st, 1913, (“be­
fore taking”) we had 42 accidents re­
sulting in loss of time. For the same 
period during 1914 (“after taking”) 
we had 9 accidents of a like nature. 
This represents a reduction of 78 per 
cent; most of it due to education of 
the workers to be careful of their own 
and fellow employees’ safety.
