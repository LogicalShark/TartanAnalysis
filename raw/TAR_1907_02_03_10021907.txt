FIRST SCRIMMAGE IS MARKED BY FAST PLAY.
HITTNER SHOWS UP WELL.
The first real scrimmage of the season occurred last Friday afternoon 
when the ’Varsity and Scrub teams lined up. About thirty candidates were in 
uniform and all of them were given a chance to show what they could do in 
order that the coaching staff might get a line on the men. The playing 
throughout was marked by hard and aggressive work on the part of both 
teams, and although the ’Varsity made good consistent gains through their 
opponents, every inch was contested by the Scrubs.
The first team was given the ball at the start and began by battering the 
second's line with shave-tackle plays that netted them some twenty yards. 
The ball, was lost on a fumble and the Scrubs began the same tactics their 
opponents had used, and Patterson, Crumley and Brown succeeded in carrying 
the pigskin back to the place of beginning. Another fumble and the ball 
went to the ’Varsity. This time the regulars changed their method of attack 
and used forward passes and end runs, which gained them ground. Wink 
Dowling got loose for a touchdown on an end play. The ball was brought 
back and in a short time Roura crossed the goal line again on a center buck. 
At this time, after about fifteen minutes of play the coaches called a halt.
The most general criticism offered by the coaches is the marked tendency 
of the men on the line to charge high. Again and again a play would be sent 
at the line and not stopped for the reason that the men would charge up and 
try to meet it in an upright position. This defect can be remedied and we 
may feel confident that this is to be an unusually successful season.
Much greater spirit must be shown by the students in support of the team 
in order that we may show the players that we appreciate what they are doing, 
for many are making sacrifice of time in order to play. Let every student 
who is not out for the team come up to the field and help give the boys a 
rousing cheer each night.

DRINKING SONG.
My comrades, when I’m no more 
drinking,
But sick with gout or palsy lie 
Exhausted on my sick bed sinking, 
Believe me, then, my end is nigh.
But die I this day or to-morrow,
My testament’s already made,
My burial from your hands I’ll bor­
row,
But without splendor or parade.
And when me. to my grave you’re 
bringing,
Then follow after man by man;
Let no sad funeral bells be ringing, 
But tinkling glasses be your plan. 
And on my tombstone be inscribed 
“This man was born—lived—drank— 
and died,
And now he lies here who imbibed 
In all life’s joys the purple tide.”------o-------

Let all our voices now be raised 
In song to fill the air;
And all our hearts with music praise 
Our Alma Mater fair.
Let all the echoes ring out clear,
In joyful strains so true
And greet the Tartan with a cheer,
Red, yellow, green and blue.
Carnegie Tech, we honor thee,
And fondly sing thy praise;
We pledge our lives in memory 
Thy sons on high to raise.
Chorus.
Then keep our hopes ascending high, 
Far reaching to the sky,
And make us thrill with pride in thee, 
Wherever we may be.

THE TARTAN
M. M. C. S.
Address delivered by Dr. Arthur Al­
ien Hamerschlag on the occasion of 
the dedication of the Margaret Mor­
rison Carnegie School for Women:
“To make and inspire the home—
To lessen suffering and increase 
happiness—
To aid mankind in its upward strug­
gles—
To ennoble and adorn life’s work, 
however humble,
These are woman’s high preroga- 
tives.”
These words written by a son to 
beautify and adorn another son’s me­
morial for his mother, express and 
epitomize those sentiments which 
form the keystone of this institution, 
into whose halls you enter.
This noble building with its mas­
terly architecture expressing both the 
home and institutional spirit is a mon­
ument to the love which maternal sac­
rifices have implanted in the hearts 
of some.
And now in speaking to daughters 
who are in their bloom of youth and 
at the threshold of their womanhood, 
I ask you to help in crystalizing both 
the spirit, the sentiment, and the use­
fulness which this institution repre­
sents to the end that your Alma Mater 
may not only welcome you, but have 
as her children those who will min­
ister and perpetuate all that is wo­
manly in the realms of American 
schools for women.
In these times of greatest progress 
towards woman’s emancipation, and 
education, many expressions and ten­
dencies toward the masculine sphere 
of action, seem to have taken firm 
hold on the finer instincts and judg­
ments of the present generation of 
women, often to their injury.
The opening of this session of your 
school year seems to me a fitting mo­
ment in which to analyze the reasons 
for this movement and then perhaps 
to touch upon the wide differences of 
woman’s education that exist in this 
country so that you may become fa­
miliar with the ideals and purposes of 
the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women and thus be pre­
pared to emphasize and develop its 
position with respect to other, institu­
tions of learning.
It is a far cry from the old-fashioned 
home and lovely family life of the 
last century, to the new woman, so- 
called; whose independence and ab­
rupt entrance into economic and pub­
lic life is so frequently in evidence 
in every sphere of action in these early 
years of this new century. It is a re­
mote but unpleasant picture which the 
household drudge brings to mind and 
a clearly unwholesome one which sub­
jects women to the rigors of factory 
life. It is a narrow sphere which per­
mits all womankind to be wholly de­
pendent upon the whims and humors 
of male members of the family and an 
equally distasteful one which shows 
even a few of your sex brazenly tram­
pling their finer instincts and quali­
ties in an attempt to disregard con­
ventions in their contact with the 
world.
I have taken the liberty of depicting 
these extremes so that you and I 
might discuss with more intelligence 
the larger group of sane womankind 
of which I am sure you wish to form 
a part. I want you to believe with 
me that the family and the home is 
not yet extinct, nor is chivalry wholly 
fled from the land; mothers and daugh­
ters are still true to their destiny, 
even though modern standards of liv­
ing have changed and made more dif­
ficult the combination of the more 
homely qualities with the economic" 
struggle for existence. Life has 
grown more complex for women; it is 
richer in luxuries, wider in culture, 
more real as to privileges, and the 
most cherished and beautiful of 
woman’s prerogatives are more easily 
within reach than during the period 
when the barriers of birth were in­
surmountable.
It is with the dawn of freedom and 
the growth of intelligence that 
woman’s sphere of action is widened 
and broadened. It has likewise made 
woman realize the necessity for an 
education different than that hereto­
fore considered necessary. The Amer­
ican standard of woman’s education 
has crystalized in the development of 
three types of institutions:
First: The intellectual education
afforded by the High and Normal 
Schools, leading to the college and 
University.
Second: The social education given
at the boarding or finishing schools 
followed later by visits to the larger
cities of this continent or Europe to 
secure that contact with culture and 
the more complex conditions of mod­
ern life to fit the women for society.
Third: Trade or industrial educa­
tion given at business colleges and 
trade schools, supplemented by a 
course in those institutions which of­
fer domestic science and domestic art 
to those of professional standing to 
develop the wage earing capacity and 
productive power of the individual.
Certain elements of all three of the 
above outlined systems of education 
are comprised in the still higher ideal 
of the Margaret Morrison Carnegie 
School for Women, taking for its 
motto the inscription with which this 
address is begun and which decor­
ates and embellishes the entrance to 
this structure. This new departure 
is an attempt to train women primari­
ly for the home, for wifehood and 
motherhood, and incidentally to give 
you those essentials comprised in in­
tellectual education, social education, 
trade and industrial education, so that 
irrespective of your ultimate position 
you may be well trained to meet life’s 
future.

The Class of ’09.
The Junior Spread in room 105, on 
Friday afternoon, September 27th, 
was an intensely interesting and 
pleasing affair. Questions of great 
importance were discussed, some heat­
edly, and voted upon. After this the 
opening dance of the M. M. C. S. of 
the class of ’09 was held in the gym­
nasium. The members of the Faculty 
were invited and showed that the 
spirit of good fellowship which they 
have always shown to the class of 
’09 still exists and in increased vol­
ume. The company dispersed with a 
rousing cheer for the class of 1909.

The ceremony of “The Capping of 
the Cooks” took place in the House­
hold Arts Department at ten o'clock 
on Friday morning. The department 
instructors were present:
Miss West—Prof. Home-Making Arts. 
Miss Bradt—Instructor in Cooking 
and Household Arts.
Miss Purmoit—Assistant to the In­
structor of Cooking and House­
hold Arts.
Miss Munson—Instructor in Sewing. 
Mr. Sharpe—Steward.
Miss Smith was the only guest of 
honor. The roll was called and Miss 
West made a short address, giving 
some valuable suggestions to the girls 
as to their attitude toward the year’s 
work, and closing with a quotation 
from John Ruskin.
“Economy no more means saving 
money than it means spending 
money. It means the administration 
of a house—its stewardship, whether 
spending or saving—that is, whether 
money, or time, or anything else to 
the best possible advantage. The 
simplest and clearest definition of it, 
economy, whether public or private, 
means the wise manifestation of la­
bor, and it means this mainly in three 
senses: .Applying your labor ration­
ally; preserving its produce carefully, 
distributing its produce seasonably.”
The caps of the girls were then 
pinned on by their instructors, and 
they were armed each with a wooden 
spoon. Miss Bradt furnished the 
dainty pattern for the cap.
The class has been the recipient of 
two German plates from Miss West, 
bearing these mottoes:
“Denke Klar” (think clearly).
“Sprich wahr” (speak truly).
“Ersst prob’s” (first test it).
“Dann lob’s” (then praise it).
The first jar of apple preserves 
made by this class was presented to 
Miss Anna B. Smith, with the follow­
ing rhyme:
Dear lady, we bring you some apple, 
Its peeling was stripe, spot or dapple, 
Be not foolishly gay,
But as time rolls away 
Let this teaching your mind firmly
grapple.
That the ills of this life,
All its care, toil and strife 
Came because Mother Eve ate an 
apple.

INVENTORS HOLD A MEETING.
On Tuesday, the 24th, the Inventors 
held their first meeting of the school 
year. The meeting was called to or­
der by the President, Mr. Neudorfer, 
and it was decided to postpone the 
election of officers until the Juniors 
had a chance to vote.
The meeting was thereupon ad­
journed to convene again on the fol­
lowing Friday. About a half dozen 
Juniors attended and were allowed to 
vote in the election of officers, which 
followed immediately after the read­
ing of minutes of the previous meet­
ing. Mr. Elmer Schumacher, of 
Woodsfield, Ohio, was elected Presi­
dent, Mr. John Hezlep serves as Vice 
President, and Mr. W. Clarence Ste­
venson continues to serve the club as 
Secretary-Treasurer. The members 
then agreed that the Juniors could be 
admitted to the full privileges of mem­
bership on payment of the admission 
fee of twenty-five cents. The meet­
ing was then adjourned.-------o-------
FIRST SHOP TOUR OF THE 
SEASON.
On last Thursday afternoon the Ma­
chine Design group of the Senior Me­
chanicals made a trip to the City
Water Works at Brilliant Station and 
to the pumping plant of Wilkinsburg 
borough about a mile further up the 
Allegheny river. Their object was to 
observe cranes used for lifting ma­
chinery in the aforesaid plants. The 
one at Brilliant was designed by Prof. 
Follows while he was with the Brown 
Hoisting Machinery Co. of Cleveland. 
Several of the students put on their 
overalls, and climbed all over the 
crane, and were thus able to make 
sketches and talk over points at close 
range. The small crane in the ma­
chine shop was next inspected. This 
was also of interest to the students 
as it is of an entirely different type, 
though very much lighter. The party 
was conducted around the plant by 
Mr. Fernald, the chief engineer.
Walking up the tracks to the second 
plant above mentioned, the party in­
spected the crane there. It is of the 
traveling gantry type and is electri­
cally operated. The engineer in 
charge very kindly manipulated the 
crane so the students could observe 
its operation. The return journey 
was made to Brilliant in the launch 
belonging to Mr. Fernald, and it was 
necessary to place part of the group 
in a rowboat which was towed behind. 
On the voyage down, George Fisher 
nearly swamped the boat, but the 
party was saved by landing on shore.
Although the object of the search, 
namely, a hand-power crane, was not 
seen, the students seemed to be well 
satisfied with what had been done.

REVIEWS OF TECHNICAL LIT­
ERATURE.
The American Machinist for Sep­
tember 26 contains two very interest­
ing articles of importance to students. 
The first entitled, “Proper Shop 
Training for Engineers,” deals with 
the student workshop problem. The 
second, an abstract from the Cornell 
Bulletin, is entitled “Education as a 
Business Proposition.” This article 
shows the income of a high school 
graduate to be 100% greater than 
that of a common school educated 
man. The increase of a college edu­
cated man is 200% greater, and no 
limit is stated to a college man’s in­
come after he has been out of school 
for a number of years. These two
articles should be read by every Tech 
man who feels that education does 
not pay.------o------
CROSS-COUNTRY PLANS.
Regular work will begin next week 
in the development of a cross-country 
team which will be sent to Philadel­
phia in April to compete at the Uni­
versity of Pennsylvania games. A 
course has been fixed in Schenley 
Park under the direction of trainer 
“Joe” Thompson and regular nightly 
“runs” will be taken. In the absence 
of Capt. Dowling, of the track team, 
who is giving all his time to foot-ball, 
“Chuck” Charles has volunteered to 
take charge of the men.
A cup has been offered by the di­
rector to be given to the winner of 
a series of runs to take place between 
the present time and the Xmas holi­
days.
“Doodles” Grafton, ex-’09, who is a 
student at the United States Naval 
Academy at Annapolis, was officially 
commended for bravery in saving one 
of his classmates from drowning. We 
learn with pleasure that “Doodles” 
is fighting hard for guard on the 
’Varsity team.
The students of the Senior class, 
Metallurgical department, will take up 
actual work at the mills in the Pitts­
burg district on Saturdays, beginning 
next week. The first work will be 
that of running a twelve-hour test on 
a gas producer.

Mr. Leeds, assistant head of the 
trade schools, is preparing a text book 
on mechanical drawing which will be 
ready for the publishers about May 
1st, 1908. The work, which will be 
in two parts, will be suitable for 
High School work and for use in the 
School of Apprentices and Journey­
men and men in the machinery trades. 
Mr. Leeds will later prepare a text­

ENGINEERING LIFE.
(An address delivered to the Senior
Class of Stevens Institute of Tech­
nology by Wm. D. Forbes, M. S.)
Young gentlemen, there will come 
a time w'hen the first words I uttered 
to you can not properly be used by any 
one who has the honor to address you 
as members of the Class of ’07, in 
other words, you will not alwTays be 
young. I am not here to sing a dole­
ful tune on the homilies of life, but 
to lay before you some facts of an 
engineer’s life, with the hope that 
some of the things I say may be of 
assistance to you in following your 
profession.
Let me say here that there are far 
too many engineers following their 
profession, and never catching up 
with it, to be successful. You must 
not only be in your profession but 
ahead of it.
In over twenty-five years of active 
engineering life in this and other 
countries I think I can put down as 
the greatest cause of failure the grave 
mistake of taking success for victory. 
The two are often far apart. Again, 
I find the mistaken idea that knowl­
edge is power, “per se”, or to put it 
more plainly, that a man who knows 
a lot is educated. I must make a 
grand distinction between knowledge 
and education.
I met not long ago a friend who 
had told me that he intended to send 
his son to this institution of learning, 
and I asked him how the boy was 
getting along. My friend, replied, 
“Oh, I gave that up, as there is no 
chance for an engineer, now' that the 
telegraph and the telephone, the wire­
less and steam turbines have all been 
invented, there being nothing left.” 
I think if the son had no better ca­
pacity of brain than the father, it was 
lucky for him that he never came to 
Stevens.
Now, young gentlemen, on that 
very point of what is to be done new, 
sometimes called inventing, the field 
is far wider than ever before, and
most inviting. Take the fact, that 
when I graduated all the work to be 
done in electricity was to be found in 
half a dozen pages of Physics, while 
to-day it is a course in itself, with 
endless possibilities.
In what may be called the great in­
ventions are not contained all the 
money making opportunities. I thor­
oughly believe if one of you young 
gentlemen will invent a lamp in which 
the adjusting screw is not always 
away from you, you will add to the 
heavenly host by preventing an im­
mense amount of profanity. Again, 
the blushes of many will be saved if 
you can only contrive some bath-room 
appliance which when used is not 
such a close imitation of the cataract, 
of the Ganges. This would in many 
of our Hoboken houses and flats be 
a blessing.
No, gentlemen, you need not fear 
that the greatest room in the world, 
the room for improvement, is in any 
way crowded. Your profession (that 
is, mechanical engineering) is, in the 
United States, hardly a profession, 
and it rests largely with you younger 
graduates to improve and alter the 
condition. It cannot be done quickly, 
for here is the trouble. A man will 
go into a pump manufactory, and asks 
for a pump. A salesman will ask 
him—
“What do you want to pump?” 
“Why, water, of course.”
“Is it hot or cold?”
“Cold.”
“How much do you want an hour?” 
“I don’t know.”
“Well, 10,000 gallons?”
“Oh, not £,000, it’s just for my 
house.”
“Have you got a tank and what is 
its size?”
“Yes, I have a tank, and it is about 
so long, so wide, and so deep.”
“Well, that would hold about 2,000 
gallons. Now our number four pump 
will pump you 1,000 gallons 60 feet 
high. Is your house as high as that?” 
“Oh, no, only about 30 feet.”
“You have a boiler, have you?” 
“Yes.”
The man is sent his number four 
pump, but he did not give the cor­
rect size of his tank, and neglected to 
say his house was on a hill 600 feet 
away and 75 feet high. The pump 
does not answer and the man is mad.
Now, abroad this would not occur. 
The man would be told “you are not 
a professional man and therefore do 
not know what you want, and we do 
not care to risk our reputation by 
guessing. Now take your card and 
go and see Mr. M. or Mr. P., both 
good engineers, and they will see 
what you need, and we shall be glad 
to fill the order for any pump they 
name.”
You do not have to seek long for 
the cause of the condition existing in 
the United States, as it is the great 
desire here to make a sale that causes 
the trouble. Many young graduates 
to-day are neglecting to take up real 
machine shop work, but let me assure 
you that, in my opinion, no mechanical 
engineer is worthy of his title unless 
he has had at least three years actual 
work in a machine shop. There is 
nothing I regret more than to notice 
this falling off in practical work.
I know full well that 7 o’clock in the 
morning is early, that machine work 
is dirty, that among the men there 
are few who care for their trades; 
but it is utterly useless to expect a 
man to successfully design tools or 
machines who is not well acquainted 
with the methods of production of 
the various parts, or to successfully 
direct a great establishment without 
concise knowledge as to the possible 
output of the machine plant.
Let me entreat you to go at once 
into a manufacturing establishment 
and work there. You, with your 
trained brain, can accomplish more in 
the practical line in one year than 
the usual apprentice does in four or 
seven. A serious error of judgment 
in the young engineer is to take a 
nice leather chair at a roller top desk 
in a New York office, and because it 
is a clean dude job, become a cleri­
cal dollar chaser, seeing almost noth­
ing of true engineering, and thus de-

I believe that, grand as is the

tion of engineering turn out an engi­
neer, and I hope to see the day when 
the title of M. E. is elevated to its 
proper place, and I look to you young 
gentlemen to aid in so doing.
In conclusion, let me tell you not to 
lose heart and get discouraged. 
Your success does not lie in the hands 
of others, but in your own. Do not 
think that the world is dow-n on you, 
or that because you merely work 
hard you should succeed. The man 
who works hard building ice ponds 
in Florida and planting orange groves 
in Maine is not entitled to victory.
Select your road and keep to it. 
Save money, not next year, nor the 
year after, but as you go, and in all 
that you do, do not be content to “do 
as well as you can,” but be deter­
mined to do as well as anybody can, 
and you will reflect honor on your­
selves and on the Stevens Institute 
of Technology.

PROTECTIVE COATINGS FOR IRON 
AND STEEL.
At the Engineering Conference of 
the Institution of Civil Engineers held 
in London in June, Bertram Blount 
read a brief paper on “The Best 
Means of Preserving Iron and .Steel 
Work in Railroad Construction.” He 
considered a bituminous preparation 
the best preservative for iron and 
steel wrork exposed to the weather. 
Natural bitumen is very permanent, 
but rather costly; coal tar, properly 
boiled so that the coating shall be 
neither brittle nor sticky, is almost 
as durable and is cheap enough. Its 
use is limited by aesthetic consider­
ations. Where the work is exposed 
to boiler gases, overhead bridges and 
station roofs, complete coating with 
a good layer of hot bitumen has so 
much practical advantage over paint 
that no question of appearance should 
be permitted consideration. For rail­
road structural steel work, such as 
the frames of buildings or frame foun- 
; dations, the author considered no 
preservative so good as lime or ce­
ment concrete. This applies whether 
the steel framing is bedded in con­
crete, or whether it forms an integral 
part of the concrete, as in the various 
ferro-concrete systems. It is essen­
tial that the concrete should be 
dense and rich in cement, and that 
the cement, or lime, should be unex­
ceptionable. Steel protected in this 
way need not first be cleaned from 
scale and rust.
In the discussion of the paper one 
speaker described experiments made 
with 14 or 15 samples of paints, all 
put on by the makers themselves. 
The prices varied between 88 shill­
ings and 15 shillings per cwt., and the 
cheapest was quite as good as the 
dearest. Only two of the paints 
caught hold of the metal, and could 
not be peeled off. These paints, 
which contained an unknown ingre­
dient, were sent to a chemist for an­
alysis, but the chemist could not find 
out what it was, but only that it was 
not injurious. An engineer of the
Midland railway said that coal tar 
had done much mischief, as it con­
tained an acid. As to paints, it is the
oil that requires most consideration. 
Much more injury than is generally 
recognized is done to rails by corro­
sion in tunnels and in towns outside 
of them. He had knowm as much as 
55 per cent, to take place in flange 
rails. Another speaker classed pig­
ments thus: First, red lead; second, 
graphite; third, oxide of iron. He 
used red lead, long ground, with 10 
per cent, raw linseed oil, and diluted 
with boiled oil to weigh 30 pounds to 
40 pounds per gallon, no driers or tur­
pentine to be added.

COPPER STEELS.
THE PIERRE BREUIL RESEARCH.
In the Journal of the Iron and Steel 
Institute, No. 2, 1907, is an account of 
a research by Pierre Breuil, of Paris, 
on copper steels. It is a good example 
of the thoroughness and accuracy with 
which French experimenters, in any 
branch of scientific research, conduct 
their work.
CHARACTERISTICS OE THE STEELS INVES­
TIGATED.
Mr. Breuil’s steels were prepared by 
the crucible process, the ingots weigh­
ing no pounds, and metallic copper 
containing 99.7 per cent, was employed. 
A crop end of 33 pounds was removed 
from the top of the ingot and n pounds 
from the bottom, the remainder being 
rolled if possible. Four series were 
prepared. The first consisted of eight 
members, with carbon about 0.15 per 
cent, and copper rising from zero to 32 
per cent. The second also had eight 
members, with carbon about 0.4 per 
cent, and copper rising from zero to 24 
per cent. The last member of this se­
ries showed a great deal of segregation, 
the interior of the ingot having at the 
bottom, 74 per cent, copper, while the 
outside had only 24 per cent. The third 
series, with approximately 0.65 per cent., 
carbon, consisted of six members, with 
the copper rising from 0.5 to 32 per 
cent., while the fourth series, of seven
members, contained about 1 per cent, 
carbon and copper rising from zero to 
about 34 per cent. Here again exces­
sive segregation was noticed, the copper 
in the last ingot varying from 16 to 52 
per cent.
Chemical analyses and fractures show7- 
ed that in all the ingots containing less 
than 4 per cent, copper there wras no 
segregation.
In the first three series, ingots con­
taining less than 8 per cent, copper 
showed no coloration in their fractures. 
With the fourth series, a coloration was 
noticed when over 3 per cent, was pres­
ent.
The main recalescence point was low­
ered by the presence of copper in the 
first three series, but not below 550 de­
grees C. (1022 degrees F.), but in the 
high carbon series it merely elongated 
this point without lowering it.
MECHANICAL TESTS.
The steels were subjected to very 
thorough mechanical tests, the results of 
which are given in detail. From the 
tensile tests, the author concludes that 
steels containing copper are closely com­
parable with steels containing nickel or 
chromium of the same carbon content, 
and followed the same laws with regard 
to their increased tensile strength with 
increased percentages of copper.
Shock tests were made with both 
notched and plain bars. The low car­
bon series, after quenching and anneal­
ing, displayed high resilience, while the
steels of other series, no matter what 
treatment they had undergone, were all 
1 brittle.
Microscopical examination was made, 
and the paper is accompanied by many 
excellent micro-photographs. The cop­
per steels commercially capable of ap­
plication are analagous to ordinary 
steelsxfrom the point of view of their 
structure, but their constituents are 
finer. The presence of copper increases 
the quantity of pearlite, and, to some 
extent, it causes the steels to be more 
highly carburizéd, and consequently 
harder. With copper up to 4 per cent., 
they contain no free copper, that element 
being in solution in the iron. It is be­
tween 4 and 8 per cent, that saturation 
appears to occur. With over 8 per 
cent., free copper is found in fibers in 
the case of soft or semisoft steels, and 
in nodules in the harder steels.
Corrosion tests were carried out by 
immersing samples in 1 to 1 sulphuric 
acid, so that the results might be com­
parable with those obtained by Hadfield. 
The loss by corrosion is over 50 per 
cent, lower in these steels than in the 
case of steel not containing copper. 
These results show the steels to rank 
in value with nickel steel in this respect.
CONCLUSIONS.
The author sums up his results in tne 
following conclusions:
1. Copper steel does not yield a
metal capable of being rolled in prac­
tice, if the percentage of copper ex­
ceeds 4. ill! : Js, !. .12. When in the ingot state copper • 
hardens steel in proportion as there is 
carbon present.
3. Copper appears to lower the upper 
change points Ar. 3 and Ar. 2 in soft 
steels; it intensifies Ar. 1 to an impor­
tant extent. In medium steel, it lowers 
this point, but not below 550 degrees C.
It does not alter its position in hard 
steels. I , *'ij
4. As regards tensile strength, copper 
steels as rolled appear to be stronger 
in proportion as they contain more cop­
per. This difference is the more mani­
fest in proportion as the carbon is lower.
5. Annealing leaves the steels with 
the same characteristics, but greatly re­
duces the differences observed in the 
case of the untreated steels, which cre­
ates the necessity for care in attempting 
a classification of these steels.
6. Quenching restores the differences 
encountered in the case of the steels as 
cast.

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTAN13
7. Copper steels equal, from the point 
of view of tensile strength, nickel steels, 
and would be less costly than the latter, 
copper being a cheaper element than 
nickel.
8. In regard to resistance to shock, 
copper steels are no more brittle than 
nickel steels containing equivalent per­
centages of nickel. The steel contain­
ing 0.16 per cent, carbon and 4 per cent, 
copper is truly remarkable in this re­
spect.
9. The presence of copper makes the 
constituents of the steel finer, and ap­
pears to alter the categories to which 
they nominally would belong by ap­
proximating them to classes containing 
higher percentages of carbon. What is 
particularly advantageous is that while 
hardening the steel the presence of cop­
per does not render it brittle. It con­
fers upon it a very fair degree of elas­
ticity, while leaving the elongation good, 
thus conducing to the production of a 
most valuable metal.
Cutting tests were carried on with 
the steels containing carbon about 1 
per cent, and copper zero, 1 per cent, 
and 3 per cent, copper respectively. It 
was concluded that the presence of cop­
per in nowise altered the cutting prop­
erties.
The electric resistance of such of the 
steels as could be rolled was also deter­
mined. The presence of copper was 
found to increase the resistance, and a 
well defined maximum was shown. This 
maximum coincides with 2 per cent, in 
the case of the 0.15 per cent, carbon 
series, with 1.7 per cent, in steels con­
taining 0.35 per cent, carbon, and with 
0.5 per cent, copper, in steels containing 
0.7 to 1 per cent, carbon.

RAILROAD ACCIDENTS.
p The epidemic of railroad accidents 
in the United States has naturally 
drawn forth a flood of comment, some 
of it to the point, and some rather 
wide of the mark. There is little 
doubt that the transportation facili­
ties of the great railway lines are 
strained to the breaking point, not in 
every element, but in certain partic­
ulars corresponding to the weak links 
in a chain cable. In nearly every 
case the terminal facilities are inad­
equate, as is evidenced by the great 
expenditures now being incurred to 
improve and extend them. This, nat­
urally, is felt first by delays in hand­
ling trains and in consequent disar­
rangement of schedules, followed by 
the increased liability to accident 
when trains are no longer on their 
regular time.
| The greatly increased demand for 
transportation has been partially met 
by the addition of longer, heavier, 
and faster trains, together with the 
use of heavier rails and strengthened 
bridges, but it is almost impossible 
to extend the operating personnel at 
the same rate as the mechanical 
equipment and at the same time 
maintain its efficiency at the maxi­
mum.
To meet the present demand for 
transportation, both in the passenger 
and in the freight service, involves 
what amounts almost to a recon­
struction of the entire system of 
many lines. When to this is added 
the possible replacement, in impor­
tant portions of large systems, of 
steam locomotives by electric trac­
tion, it will be realized that the rail­
road situation is not unlike the prob­
lem of rebuilding a great bridge with­
out interrupting traffic, and that at a 
time when the traffic is greater than 
ever before.
It must not be assumed that this 
state of affairs is advanced as an ex­
cuse for the sad disasters and great 
loss of life which have been the sub­
ject of comment, but it is necessary 
that the situation should be viewed 
intelligently and thoughtfully if the 
permanent remedies are to be found. 
The pressure of the demand for trans­
port cannot be met simply by putting 
more and faster trains upon existing 
roadbeds, using present limited ter­
minal accommodations. To do so is
simply to invite disaster, and it is 
better to meet with recriminations for 
inadequate service than to face the 
moral and financial responsibility of 
such a series of disasters as the past 
few months have recorded in the 
United States.
One of the points which has been 
made against the railways, and ap­
parently with justice, is the laxity in 
operation of the block-signal system, 
carried to such an extent as practical­
ly to neutralize nearly all of the pro­
tection which it is supposed to af­
ford. That an engineer should be 
permitted, under any consideration j 
whatever, to run past a block signal, 
is to render that system far worse 
than useless, since its presence cre­
ates a sense of security which does 
not exist. If no signal system is in­
stalled, the very feeling of insecurity 
creates an individual degree of watch­
fulness, which gives some protec­
tion. When, however, a system, ad- j 
mirable in itself, serves to lull that 
watchfulness, while at the same time ; 
its value is practically destroyed by 
the violation of its fundamental prin- j 
ciple, it is far worse than none. The j 
first thing which should be done, if 
the railways of the United States wish 
to allay the feeling of insecurity 
which the recent accidents have cre­
ated, is to announce, in unmistakable 
terms, that the block system is to be 
enforced absolutely, and to make that 
statement good ' beyond suspicion.-— 
Cassier’s Magazine.
