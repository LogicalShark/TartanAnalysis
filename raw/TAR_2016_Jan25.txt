An apology letter from The Tartan
Dear readers of The Tartan,
In the last issue of 2015, we published a series of let-
ters to the editor about the black student experience at 
Carnegie Mellon. When these letters were published, it 
was brought to our attention that the letters had been ed-
ited in the production process, which is not only against 
our policy, but highly unethical. Though the editing was 
an innocent mistake that resulted from a training gap, it 
is regrettable and unacceptable.
The message of the letters was altered when the let-
ters were edited without the permission of the authors. 
We at The Tartan are deeply sorry that this happened, 
and are taking all of the necessary steps to ensure that it 
will not happen again.
The letters to the editor we publish are intended to 
be a platform from which student voices from our com-
munity can be heard. By editing the letters, The Tartan 
violated the trust of the student body. In light of this, we, 
Brian Trimboli and Laura Scherb, Editor-in-Chief and 
Publisher, respectively, would like to reiterate the revised 
policy that is effective immediately:
“Letters must be submitted by 5 p.m. on the Wednes-
day before publication by mail or to forum@thetartan.
org. Letters from within the university community take 
precedence. Letters intended for publication must be 
signed and include the author’s address and telephone 
number for veri?cation; letters must not exceed 350 
words. No edits will be made to any published letters 
without the author’s permission; in the case of no re-
sponse from the author, The Tartan reserves the right to 
postpone the publication of the letter. Authors’ names 
may be withheld from publication upon request. The Tar-
tan reserves the right to reject any letter.”
On behalf of the entire staff of The Tartan, we would 
like to apologize again for our actions regarding these let-
ters to the editor. It was never our intention to silence a 
voice or change a narrative, and we hope that we can re-
gain the trust of the student body in light of these actions.
Sincerely,
Laura Scherb, Publisher, 2015
Brian Trimboli, Editor-in-Chief, 2015
Addendum:
As the new Tartan leadership, it’s important to us that 
our letter to the editor policy be sustainable moving for-
ward. We do not intend to return to our ?awed original 
policy, but in the coming weeks, we will consult with 
industry professionals and legal aide in order to solidify 
a new policy that best bene?ts both The Tartan and the 
Carnegie Mellon community. We welcome continued 
discussion and will gladly meet with anyone who wishes 
to further discuss our course of action in this matter. The 
campus community will be promptly informed of any fu-
ture changes to our policy. In the interim, the changes to 
the policy will stand as written above. Our main goal is to 
ensure that letters to the editor remain an effective plat-
form for student and community voices.
Sincerely,
Sarah Gutekunst, Publisher

Panelists share advice in The Black Experience
RAHEELA AHSAN
Staffwriter
In honoring the legacy of 
Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., 
Carnegie Mellon University’s 
Black Graduate Student Or-
ganization arranged a discus-
sion panel last Wednesday 
to address what it is like be-
ing black and involved in the 
media. 
In attendance were: Tony 
Atkins, digital content pro-
ducer for WPXI-TV Pittsburgh, 
Kyshira Moffett, creator of 
thisishermovement.com, and 
Clarece Polke, creator of very-
smartbrothers.com. Each of 
the panelists has established 
themselves professionally in 
the media, either online or on 
television, and was open to 
discussing both the obstacles 
and the successes they faced 
in their journalistic pursuits. 
Kristin Warren, a doctoral stu-
dent in mechanical engineer-
ing at Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity and president of the 
Black Graduate Student Orga-
nization, acted as moderator.
The panelists were ?rst 
asked about their beginnings 
in the media world and how 
they climbed to the positions 
of power they are in now. Mof-
fett talked about her passion 
for writing, saying “Initially, I 
started a blog for ?nding jobs. 
Then I launched another blog, 
rebranded a couple times 
while I was trying to ?nd my-
self. ‘This is #hermovement’ 
is the newest rebranding. 
Now, it’s a voice for millennial 
professionals who care about 
their work – a media site to 
normalize black women who 
are not stereotyped in other 
media.” Atkins added that as a 
child he really enjoyed visual 
storytelling and drawing. He 
stated, “At ?rst, I wanted to 
go into politics and be a poli-
tician, but being a journalist 
allows you to go into multi-
faceted interests. So I studied 
sports journalism, and from 
there I went to the newspa-
per, the news, and now TV.” 
Finally, Polke discussed his 
transition from being the as-
sociate editor for his school 
newspaper to becoming a 
high school English teacher 
to then running his own busi-
ness at Dusquene University. 
“I started a personal blog, 
became friends with another 
blogger and created ‘very-
smartbrothers.com.’ During 
the recession, I got laid off at 
Duquesne, but my blog con-
tinued to grow,” Polke said.
The panelists were then 
asked to address the dif?cul-
ties faced by people of color 
when trying to impede the 
media industry. Clarence Pol-
ke believes that the answer 
to this depends on what type 
of media is being considered. 
“There is never a better time 
than now to go into what you 
want,” Polke said. “There are 
all types of people who have 
voices and a platform. You 
need to ?nd a way to separate 
from the bullshit and what’s 
real and what makes sense. If 
you’re a person of color who 
has an interest in media, there 
are literally dozens of ways to 
do that. Go to school, be a so-
cial media star, or just try your 
best to excel in your passion.”
Agreeing with Polke, Mof-
fett added that “the biggest 
thing is de?ning who you 
want to be. Separate who you 
see from your authenticity. 
What is your expertise and 
niche, passion and outlet, 
what can’t you stop talking 
about?” Atkins added his own 
anecdote about working in 
sports media in Milwaukee, 
describing it as being like “the 
good ol’ boys.” “More often 
than not, the guys that were 
‘in’ were old white dudes who 
didn’t want to let go of their 
positions. After nearly a year, I 
felt more tolerated than want-
ed at my ?rst internship, so I 
decided to leave, and join my 
friend’s blog called ‘bucksket-
ball.com’ and ‘acmepacking-
company.com’ and I blogged 
and built a following through 
nontraditional media. I was 
writing and exercising those 
muscles when I graduated. 
I saw a door and I broke it 
down, but sometimes you 
have to go around it.” Polke 
continued, “just because there 
are less barriers to entry now, 
doesn’t mean there aren’t ob-
stacles. As you continue to 
ascend in certain media, there 
are glass ceilings for people 
of color and women, say, the 
New York Times. There are 
people of color everywhere 
else, but once you start going 
into those boardrooms where 
people are buying and making 
decisions, you’ll start seeing 
less of people of color. There 
is a perception that because

CMU increases tuition by 3.2% for current students
VALENE MEZMIN
News Editor
To start off the 2016 spring 
semester, Carnegie Mellon 
students received an email 
notifying them that the tu-
ition rates for the 2016-2017 
academic year and beyond 
(until further notice) were re-
cently approved by the Board 
of Trustees. It was announced 
that undergraduate tuition has 
been increased by 3.2 percent.
For a school with an al-
ready whopping price tag, this 
comes as devastating news 
for many. But maybe having 
a better understanding of the 
necessity for these gradual tu-
ition increases and the bene?ts 
of them will help to put more 
meaning behind the numbers.
For current freshmen, 
sophomores, and juniors, 
tuition will increase from 
$49,610 to $51,196. Current 
seniors, who are part of a ?ve 
year program, will be slightly 
spared with a tuition price of 
$50,690. Next year’s incoming 
freshmen, however, will face 
the additional expenses of the 
$270 orientation fee as well 
as the standard ?rst year meal 
plan price of $5,490, bringing 
their tuition increase to 3.28 
percent.
Tuition price was not all 
that was raised. There are 
other factors that contribute 
to the total cost of attendance, 
most of which faced slight in-
creases as well. Tuition rates 
for the entire undergraduate 
student body will be topped 
off with a $180 transportation 
fee, a $400 technology fee, an 
undergraduate activity fee of 
$254 and a graduate activity 
fee of $210. Room and board 
has also been set at $7,780 for 
a standard double room. The 
only price that did not change 
was the media fee which is still 
its usual $10. 
While the above stated 
numbers are for the average 
Carnegie Mellon student, 
there are two main factors that 
are sure to vary on a student 
by student case. Firstly, prices 
will vary for certain students 
depending on room and board 
selections, choosing to opt out 
of a meal plan etc. Also, the 
general price stated is, in most 
cases, not what students end 
up paying.
Carnegie Mellon has time 
and again asserted that it is 
committed to lessening the ?-
nancial burden of its students 
through ?nancial aid pack-
ages. The University makes 
it a priority to help provide 
students with scholarships, 
fellowships, grants, and other 
?nancial support methods. In 
essence, no one will be forced 
to pay a fee that is wildly out of 
their limit.
Knowing that you are at-
tending a highly competitive 
university is usually attached 
with the knowledge that there 
will be a great price tag. In 
September 2015, U.S. News 
and World Report ranked 
the university as number 23 
for best national university. 
It was also ranked seventh 
for undergraduate business

Carnegie Mellon’s John 
R. Anderson has dedicated a 
life of research to developing 
a uni?ed theory of cognition 
and using it to create cog-
nitive-based tutors. For his 
successful work in develop-
ing such tutors, the National 
Academy of Sciences will 
award Anderson the 2016 
Atkinson Prize in Psycholog-
ical and Cognitive Sciences 
for his “foundational contri-
butions to systematic theory 
and optimality analysis in 
cognitive and psychological 
science and for developing 
effective, theory-based cog-
nitive tutors for education,” 
according to a university 
press release.
The prize includes 
$100,000 and a gold-plated 
bronze medal, which 
Anderson will receive at the 
Academy’s annual meeting 
on Sunday, May 1 in Wash-
ington D.C. This year’s other 
winner of the prize, which 
goes to two researchers ev-
ery two years, is Stanford 
University’s Carol S. Dwek.
“John’s work on the ACT 
cognitive model is at the 
heart of intelligent tutoring 
systems, an innovation that 
is bene?ting hundreds of 
thousands of students and 
continues to be a major area 
of research at Carnegie Mel-

tor of the Human-Computer 
Interaction Institute. “This 
latest and very signi?cant 
honor for John is ?tting and 
well-deserved.”

DEBORAH CHU
Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Heinz Col-
lege hosted a talk for its Lead-
ership Lecture Series, which 
featured Paul Mango, the 
director of the Pittsburgh of-
?ce of McKinsey & Company, a 
global management consulting 
?rm. Mango spoke about his 
journey through West Point, 
Harvard Business School, and 
the U.S. Army before he joined 
McKinsey over twenty years 
ago, as well as what he had 
learned about leadership along 
the way.
Starting at his roots, Mango 
spoke about being a second-
generation American and 
growing up in an Italian, Irish 
Catholic family in Syracuse, 
New York in the sixties. As the 
fourth child of his parents, 
Mango quipped that he was 
“basically unsupervised,” and 
developed a close relationship 
with his siblings. Mango de-
scribed his background as “very 
traditional, but relatively lower 
middle class.”
As a kid, Mango spent his 
time playing basketball and 
baseball. In high school, Man-
go initially believed that his 
skills in baseball would allow 
him to become a professional 
player, paying no attention to 
academics. However, a sports 
injury during his sophomore 
year caused him to start consid-
ering other options for his fu-
ture. Later, he re?ected that the 
injury was “the ?rst best thing 
that happened in my life.”
The second self-described 
“serendipity” to occur in Man-
go’s life was getting into West 
Point, in that “it was immedi-
ately post-Vietnam, and almost 
no one wanted to go.” It was a 
?ve year obligation, and there 
was only one degree offered at 
the time – general engineering. 
Having to attend class six days a 
week, Mango had to learn how 
to study, in addition to receiv-
ing training as a cadet, describ-
ing how “we all took the same 
course, every day, as a class, 
which was actually very good.”
After graduating from West 
Point, Mango joined the best 
unit in the army at the time, 
the 82nd Airborne Division. Its 
mission was “to be anywhere in 
the world in 48 hours,” which 
involved intense and compre-
hensive training and logistics. 
According to Mango, “it was 
a very exciting place, because 
from a leadership perspective, 
they ask 22 and 23-year-old 
lieutenants to take 30 people 
in a platoon, ?y them halfway 
across the world, and make 
sure they had enough spare 
socks in their rucksacks to last 
for two weeks. You were kind 
of half den mother…but also 
had to be very cognizant of all 
the things associated with the 
mission.”
Mango’s second assignment 
was in Germany, years before 
the Berlin Wall came down, at a 
time when the buildup of mili-
tary power had already peaked 
and was starting to become un-
necessary. It was at that point 
that Mango decided to apply 
to Harvard Business School. It 
was a “radically different learn-
ing experience” compared to 
West Point, according to Man-
go, but was still a “great expe-
rience.” Mango described that 
“at West Point, it was very sim-
ple…if you did your homework 
and you studied, you’d prob-
ably do okay. At Harvard, it’s 
complete ambiguity ... there’s 
no right answer, there’s no 
wrong answer, and 50 percent 
of your grade is based on class 
participation.”
After Harvard, Mango 
moved to Pittsburgh to join 
McKinsey & Company in 1988. 
In the ‘90s, McKinsey under-
went a radical change, trans-
forming from a generalist mod-
el built around serving local 
clients to a “model built around 
expertise that had to be project-
ed anywhere in the country or 
anywhere in the world.” Mango 
chose to specialize in health 
care. There was no health care 
practice at McKinsey at the 
time, but McKinsey started to 
serve health care clients, and 
so Mango helped organize the 
health care practice. Mango ex-
plained that “in 15 to 18 years, 
[the health care practice] went 
from nonexistent to about 15 to 
20 percent of what McKinsey 
does ... globally.”
Re?ecting on his journey, 
Mango commented on the ser-
endipity in his life. In terms of 
how he made life decisions, he 
stated, “the one thing I knew 
was, whatever ?eld I was going 
into, I wanted to be part of the 
best organization in that ?eld.” 
His advice was not to be “overly 
fastidious” in how to make de-
cisions, and to look at the quali-
ty of the organization in its ?eld 
and to go for it.
Mango then spoke about 
the ?ve things he learned 
about leadership. The ?rst one 
occurred at a McKinsey partner 
meeting, in which the Prime 
Minister of Israel said some-
thing that stuck with Mango: 
“Let me tell you what I think 
leadership is about. It’s not 
about being on top, it’s about 
being out in front.”
“It’s important to under-
stand, it’s not about hierarchy. 
It’s not about using authority 
to in?uence people, it’s about 
demonstrating through ex-
ample that they want to follow 
you,” Mango explained.
The second thing Mango 
learned about leadership was 
that leaders have to “self-
lessly invest in their people’s 
development.” Mango men-
tioned an experience from 
West Point in which the platoon 
leader responsible for training 
his group of cadets, despite 
constantly calling them dead-
beats, “really did care about us 
and his mission. He understood 
his mission was to make us ca-
pable, competent young sol-
diers, and that’s how he spent 
all his time. And we realized 
that ... no matter what he said 
to us.”
Mango added that “the 
people that join McKinsey have 
extremely high development 
aspirations, so we spend a lot of 
time on their programs, on their 
careers, on their advancement, 
and giving them probably too 
much feedback … it takes a lot 
of time, but it’s well worth it.”
The third lesson in 
leadership dealt with integrity, 
although Mango clari?ed that 
“leaders have integrity, but it’s 
not just honesty, it’s not just eth-
ics … there’s also consistency 
and reliability. Think about 
integrity in a very broad sense.”
Mango’s fourth point in 
leadership was that “leaders 
dampen, they don’t amplify 
anxiety.” He said that “leader-
ship is not just about how you 
act all day, but it’s particularly 
when you’re under stress.”
Mango also noted that 
“we think good leaders are 
fundamentally optimistic; not 
unrealistically optimistic, but 
optimistic.” 
Mentioning an incident in 
which a managing director at 
McKinsey was forced to ?re a 
regional leader for being pes-
simistic, he explained that “it’s 
the whole demeanor that you 
bring to a leadership role that is 
quite important, and people do 
notice. And they respond very 
favorably to, again, not unre-
alistic optimism, but certainly 
optimism.”

CMU students attend job-search conference 
KRISHNA RAO
Staffwriter
Students from Carnegie 
Mellon were among those 
to attend the Career and In-
ternship Connections (CIC) 
event earlier this month. 
The conference, held in ma-
jor cities across the country, 
took place between Jan. 4 
and Jan. 6, and included 
undergraduate students 
from a range of schools. 18 
institutions were represent-
ed in total, including Johns 
Hopkins University, Wash-
ington University in St. 
Louis, Tufts University, and 
Carnegie Mellon University.
The event first began in 
1999, founded on the prin-
ciple of “bringing students 
to the employer.” 
The event is specifically 
designed for students pur-
suing career and internship 
opportunities in business 
and the social sciences, and 
to a lesser extent healthcare 
and hospitality. Rather than 
making numerous campus 
visits, employers can meet 
with large numbers of stu-
dents who are home over 
break near major metro-
politan areas. Also, many 
of the companies hiring op-
erate out of the respective 
city, which would be ideal 
for students who are look-
ing to work or intern from 
home.
Drawing on the success 
of the original event in New 
York City, additional events 
were started in Boston, 
Washington D.C., and Los 
Angeles. Now, the organi-
zation garners nearly 5000 
student applications. New 
York, host to the largest 
event, brings in about 750 
students and 95 employers 
every year. 
The CIC attracts a large 
number of students because 
it offers same-day inter-
views. Students must sub-
mit their resumes to pro-
spective employers a month 
ahead of time, while addi-
tionally registering for the 
interviews. They meet with 
the employers after the 
career fair for a half-hour 
time slot, either in a group 
with others or individually. 
For students who did not 
sign up for interviews prior 
to the Nov. 30 deadline, 
around 20 to 40 spaces are 
typically left open for em-
ployers to offer last-minute 
interviews on the day of the 
event.
The day is organized 
into two parts: a morning 
career fair and afternoon 
interviews. Employers table 
with at least two to three 
recruiters, who interact 
with students and dissemi-
nate information about the 
company. Companies are 
divided into rooms based 
on what category they fall 
under, such as financial 
services, healthcare, or 
nonprofits.
Although the best 
chances of landing a job 
or internship position are 
with the same-day inter-
views, many companies 
at the CIC do not offer in-
terviews and may reach 
out to students later after 
screening their resumes. 
Companies often have sep-
arate recruiting processes 
and may refer conference 
attendees to separate ap-
plication processes. Em-
ployers at the CIC are very 
diverse in makeup, ranging 
from renowned nonprofits 
like Sloan Kettering Cancer 
Research Hospital to high-
power investment banks 
with billions of dollars un-
der management like Black 
Rock.
The Career and Profes-
sional Development Center 
(CPDC) at Carnegie Mellon 
is a great resource to pre-
pare for events like the CIC. 
Starting with the re-
sume, the CPDC can help 
students prepare for job 
interviews and career fairs. 
The CPDC has resume 
guidelines on their web-
site, which are department-
specific and a great place to 
start out. Other services in-
clude resume checking, ca-
reer counseling, and mock 
interviews. Events similar 
to the CIC take place on 
campus throughout the 
year, and most require just 
a Carnegie Mellon ID to 
enter. Additionally, Tartan-
Trak is also an online re-
source for Carnegie Mellon 
students searching for jobs 
and internships.
One of the greatest ben-
efits of going to career fairs, 
in addition to the prospect 
of getting a job, is the net-
working opportunities. 
Many of the hiring man-
agers of companies return 
year after year to the same 
conference. 
Bill Burke, the vice 
president of marketing at 
CBS consumer products, 
said that he recalls meeting 
students who built their re-
sumes based on the advice 
he gave them at the CIC. 
For many employers, going 
to career fairs is a good way 
to keep in touch with stu-
dents and offer them tips 
on how to be better candi-
dates for companies. Often, 
if students are not qualified 
for the job, recruiters will 
hand out business cards as 
a way to stay in touch.
This year’s CIC was an-
other success, providing 
hundreds of students with 
internships and job oppor-
tunities. The knowledge 
gained from attending 
these events is invaluable, 
and is surely a great learn-
ing experience for many.

Panelists for The Black Experience discussed the successes and downfalls they faced while pursuing their current jobs in the media. 
Rather than making numerous 
campus visits, employers can 
meet with large numbers of 
students who are home over 
break near major metropolitan 
areas.
it’s by a black person, it’s less 
reliable.”
Now, given the panelists’ 
respective struggles, Warren 
inquired what each media 
personality felt about their fol-
lowing, and what truly de?nes 
the meaning of “success.” 
“Brand creation is more of an 
art than an actual science,” 
Polke said. “I can’t think of a 
speci?c point where I thought 
I made it, it’s just an organic 
feeling where certain things 
happen and certain opportu-
nities continue to come. It has 
to do more with engagement 
and opportunities through 
your work.” Atkins added that 
“engagement is de?nitely very 
important.” “Try to relay any 
information to your friends,” 
he said. “I think people follow 
me because I’m the newsper-
son that’s not traditionally up-
tight, I try to be friendly and 
outgoing in my tweets and 
reply back and connect back, 
as opposed to being a stiff-
type celebrity.” Additionally, 
Moffett noted that the most 
important aspects of in?u-
ence are authenticity and con-
sistency. “I didn’t expect my 
blog to be a business but my 
blog was getting customers. I 
know I have a good following 
because if I don’t post, I know 
people miss me. When people 
recognize you for your work 
and have taken your advice, 
this shows that your brand is 
sustainable. Therefore, it’s im-
portant to take opportunities 
from it. My writing gives me 
opportunities to talk, which is 
very interesting.”
At this point in the event, 
the audience was open to 
ask their own questions. One 
member asked whether each 
of the personalities felt that 
they were a spokesperson for 
a speci?c group or if they’ve 
broken the barrier for anyone 
of other demographics. Polke 
responded, “My blog is a very 
unique style of humor, satire, 
style, etc. By being who we 
are, it has made us more pop-
ular. People who aren’t in our 
targeted demographic know 
where to ?nd it. It’s like the 
cheesecake factory, you have 
so much on the menu. Those 
types of media outlets do ex-
ist, but if you don’t have that 
type of bank, then the best 
thing is to be very, very direct 
and speci?c to your goals and 
your brand.” Atkins agreed, 
noting “that different news 
outlets cater to different de-
mographics.” Moffett added 
her own personal experience 
with her website. She stated 
“for instance, ‘bombshell-
branding’ is geared towards 
women, but I’ve had ?ve men 
come to me. I’ve had a lot of 
men feel comfortable with 
coming to events. My content 
blogging de?nitely helps with 
that.”
Finally, in light of recent 
discussions surrounding the 
Oscar nominations, Warren 
inquired as to whether any 
of the panelists felt strongly 
regarding the lack of nomina-
tion of people of color in the 
Oscars. She surprisingly re-
ceived very opposing respons-
es. Atkins replied, “as some-
one who had to create his own 
thing to get in, I never would 
care. But if I was Will Smith in 
the Oscars, I wouldn’t boycott 
it, because I would never re-
ally care”. On the other hand, 
Polke felt differently. “These 
awards are valuable. They 
give you name recognition, 
help your personal brand, and 
allow you to increase what 
they can command (from 2 
to 10 million per movie)” said 
Poole. “You cannot minimize 
the value and psychic bene?t 
of being recognized.”
PANEL, from A1
Diversity in media is celebrated with panel
and sixth for undergradu-
ate engineering. The Princ-
eton Review ranked it as 
the best college for theater. 
The recognition goes on and 
on. Attending a competi-
tive school with such high 
recognition, in the long run, 
allows many students to reap 
the bene?ts of money spent 
on tuition now later on in 
their future careers.
Tuition increases, such as 
these, are often necessary in 
order to uphold the prestige 
and the overall rewarding 
college experience that is 
provided to us as members 
of the Carnegie Mellon com-
munity. It is believed that 
the amount of energy, time, 
and money that is put in to 
our college careers will be 
returned to us years later. 
Our tuition money is directed 
towards sustaining rigorous 
programs for competitive 
students as well as acquir-
ing some of the best faculty 
members, in addition to 
maintaining and expanding 
educational facilities. With-
out any of this, we would be 
at a serious disadvantage at 
attaining the best education 
possible.

Researchers use machine learning to understand synapses
NAVIYA SINGLA
Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon re-
searchers, alongside others, 
are focusing on neurologi-
cal research with the goal 
of gaining a deeper under-
standing of how specific 
parts of the brain relate to 
the organ’s overall function.
Currently, many specific 
functions are thought to be 
localized in certain parts of 
the brain. The neocortex, for 
example, which is comprised 
of six layers, is the part of 
the brain that is associated 
with higher cognitive pro-
cesses such as spatial rea-
soning, generation of motor 
commands, sensory percep-
tion, and conscious thought. 
Each layer of the neo-
cortex is made up of dif-
ferent cell types, which are 
organized in a very specific 
way. Based on a particular 
person’s experiences, or the 
“load” experienced by their 
nervous system, neurons in 
the brain form or retract, 
and can even grow new con-
nections. These connections 
are called synapses, and 
they form the basis for neu-
ral communication. 
Researchers are currently 
working on understanding 
the activity of these neurons 
and defining the specific set 
of rules that govern cell-to-
cell communication.
A new method developed 
by researchers at Carnegie 
Mellon uses machine learn-
ing algorithms coupled 
with a specialized staining 
technique to create a broad-
er picture of neocortical 
synapses. This method of 
microscopy takes in a large 
piece of tissue and visualizes 
all of the synapses across its 
entirety. These synapses ap-
pear as little, dark spots with 
a specific shape. 
This method then uses a 
machine learning algorithm 
to identify and differenti-
ate the synapses in the data. 
By doing so, a larger area 
of the cortical region can 
be analyzed, compared to 
the relatively tiny capabil-
ity of existing microscopy                   
techniques. These tech-
niques not only took a much 
longer time to analyze the 
same amount of tissue, but 
also had a very limited scope 
of vision. For example, they 
would allow a “cell-by-cell,” 
“pair-by-pair connection” to 
be observed, but the cost, in 
terms of both time and effi-
ciency, were very heavy. 
Thus, by giving less 
importance to cell-type 
specificity, the team’s new 
technique allows for a much 
faster way to understand 
synaptic activity.
“This is probably the larg-
est microscopy study that 
has ever been done in terms 
of looking at lots of animals 
and a really broad array of 
tissue,” Alison Barth, one 
of the key members of the 
research project and a mem-
ber of the Center for Neural 
Basis of Cognition (CNBC) 
said. The CNBC is a joint

JOSH BROWN
SciTech Editor
Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity Hyperloop team gave 
a quick overview presenta-
tion of their entry for the 
2016 SpaceX Hyperloop 
Pod Competition on Friday, 
Jan. 22.
The ultimate goal of a 
Hyperloop system is to “rev-
olutionize travel and con-
nection between people,” 
according to Michael Hill, 
a masters student in the 
Tepper School of Business 
at Carnegie Mellon. The 
purpose of the Hyperloop 
system is “to create a tube 
connecting San Francisco 
to Los Angeles” where one 
could travel at speeds ap-
proaching 760 mph, con-
densing the entire 386 mile 
journey into 30 minutes of 
mach-speed travel. Elon 
Musk, the CEO and CTO 
of SpaceX, has outsourced 
this problem to universi-
ties and engineering teams 
far and wide in an effort to 
make this futuristic dream 
a reality. As one of the 100 
teams sorted out of 1,500 to 
be in the semi-finals, Carn-
egie Mellon Hyperloop is 
well on its way to making a 
functioning Hyperloop hap-
pen.
The end goal for Carn-
egie Mellon’s Hyperloop 
team is to receive the okay 
to build a functioning Hy-
perloop pod and compete 
against 10 to 14 other teams 
in California this coming 
June. The team began its 
work in May and has since 
grown to include over 75 
members, not only from 
engineering backgrounds 
but from design and busi-
ness as well. This robust 
team has allowed Carnegie 
Mellon Hyperloop to raise a 
tremendous amount of sup-
port and money — $25,000 
so far. If they make it 
through to the next stage of 
the competition, they will be 
looking at a $100,000 price 
tag for their Hyperloop pod 
prototype build.
The presentation, given 
by the project manager An-
shuman Kumar, a masters 
student in the Integrated In-
novation Institute, focused 
on the internal mechanics of 
the pod’s design. The system 
was designed to move at low 
levels of friction utilizing an 
air bearing system that has 
never been used before in 
mass transport. Air bearings 
use a thin layer of pressur-
ized air, which allows two 
surfaces to support an ob-
ject’s load, similar to the way 
an air-hockey table supports 
a puck. Since air bearings 
are a contact-free system, 
they steer clear of many 
problems relating to friction, 
lubrication, and wear. They 
also have high-speed ap-
plications which are prime 
for Hyperloop purposes. 
This system is an interest-
ing choice, considering the 
low-pressure, low air density 
conditions within the Hyper-
loop tube itself. One of the 
main balancing acts facing 
the team, it seems, is the bal-
ance between having enough 
air for the bearings to func-
tion and having as little air 
as possible to create drag

award recognizes those who 
have made lasting contribu-
tions to America’s competi-
tiveness and quality of life 
and helped strengthen the 
Nation’s technological work-
force.
Rothberg, who holds a 
B.S. in chemical engineer-
ing from Carnegie Mellon         
University, an M.S., M.Phil., 
and Ph.D. in biology from 
Yale University and an Hon-
orary Doctorate of Science 
from Mount Sinai School of 
Medicine, is being recognized 
for pioneering what has come 
to be known as Next Genera-
tion Sequencing, a method 
of DNA sequencing that has 
greatly increased the speed 
and ef?ciency of analyzing 
genomes and decoding DNA.
“My motivation for 
developing high-speed ways 
to understand a person’s ge-

Venus flytrap 
learn by counting 
insect touch
A German research team 
has found that the Venus fly-
trap initiates different pro-
cesses in its digestion of in-
sect food depending on the 
number of times an insect 
stimulates the plant’s sen-
sors. Broadly speaking, an 
insect that sits on the inner 
surface of the plant’s maw, 
the part of the plant used 
to trap prey, stimulates the 
micro sensors located there, 
which causes the firing of bi-
ological electrical impulses 
known as action potentials. 
The study reveals that af-
ter two action potentials, the 
trap closes shut in a 10 to 15 
second time window. Once 
the prey has been trapped, 
another three or more ac-
tion potentials cause the re-
lease of prey-degenerative 
fluids that allow the plant 
to obtain the necessary nu-
trients from the insect. Fur-
ther studies may focus on 
reachers’ ability to better 
understand exactly how the 
series of electrical impulses 
triggers the different stag-
es of the plant’s biological 
response.

Hag?sh hydrogel 
has unique 
properties
Recently, the gel properties 
of Hag?sh slime have caught 
the attention of a group of 
ETH Zurich researchers at 
the Laboratory of Food Pro-
cess Engineering of Professor 
Erich Windhab. Hag?sh are 
eel-shaped ?sh that have been 
around for millions of years. 
The hag?sh’s defense 
mechanism consists of secret-
ing two types of cells into sur-
rounding ocean water, one 
producing protein ?laments 
and the other producing mu-
cin, a protein whose key char-
acteristic is its ability to form 
gels. When released, these 
cells burst, and the two pro-
teins react with the water to 
instantaneously form slime, 
which can immobilize the sur-
rounding water and predators. 
Hag?sh slime consists of near-
ly 100 percent water and only 
0.004 percent gelling agent. 
These ?laments, measuring 
150 micrometers within the 
?sh, extend to several centi-
meters in length when intro-
duced into ocean water. While 
this mechanism is under heavy 
study, it eludes researchers 
thus far.

Robots to 
wither into dust 
alongside humans
Scientists at the Ital-
ian Institute of Technology 
(IIT) are creating bioplas-
tics from food waste, which 
can be used to create life-
like, biodegradable skin 
for robots. This could allow 
robots to decompose at the 
end of their lives in an eco-
friendly manner. Athanassia 
Athanassiou, who leads the 
Smart Materials Lab at the 
IIT, says that the bioplastic 
can be flexible or tough, so it 
could be used for both robot 
skin and interior robot parts. 
A biodegradable robot 
can have many uses, and, 
as robotics Professor Jona-
than Rossiter at the Univer-
sity of Bristol stated in 2012, 
“once a biodegradable robot 
has reached the end of its 
mission, for example hav-
ing performed some envi-
ronmental cleanup activity 
following an oil spill, it will 
decompose into harmless 
material.” 
Athanassiou says that 
creating a completely bio-
degradable robot could be 
possible within the next few 
years.

Zebra stripes not 
for camou?age nor 
social interactions
Researchers from the Uni-
versity of California, Davis 
and University of Calgary, 
Canada have suggested that 
zebra stripes are not used pri-
marily for camou?age, as pre-
viously thought. This study 
involved the analysis of data 
that took into account the vis-
ibility of stripes by hyenas, 
lions and even zebras under 
different lighting conditions 
and over several distances. 
It was found that, unlike 
humans, zebra predators can-
not distinguish zebra stripes 
at distances of 50 meters in 
daylight and 30 meters at 
twilight. Furthermore, it be-
comes harder for most species 
to distinguish these stripes 
from nine meters on moon-
less nights. Within such short 
distances, most zebra preda-
tors can already smell and 
hear their prey. This renders 
the stripes ineffective as cam-
ou?age. This also disproves 
the hypothesis that stripes 
perform a social function, 
since zebras cannot identify 
the stripes from distances 
that are signi?cantly greater 
than their predators can see.

Internet use 
affects family 
dynamics
A study from the Univer-
sity of North Carolina, Chapel 
Hill and Georgia State Univer-
sity aims to better understand 
the familial communication 
and relationships of students 
with problematic Internet use 
(PIU). PIU is characterized 
by “spending more than 25 
hours a week on the Internet 
on non-school or non-work-
related activities, and expe-
riencing Internet-associated 
health or psychosocial prob-
lems.” 
The study involved inter-
preting data from 27 students 
who identi?ed themselves as 
being problematic Internet 
users. The results of the study 
show that these students con-
nect with their families better 
when away from them but 
demonstrate deteriorated 
communication and con?ict 
when with them in-person. 
PIU is associated with nega-
tive mental health issues such 
as depression, social anxiety, 
and sleeplessness, and it is es-
timated to be found in as high 
as 15 percent of the U.S. pop-
ulation, with college students 
especially prone to it.

Science disproves 
Spiderman 
viability
Research from the Uni-
versity of Cambridge’s De-
partment of Zoology recently 
found that geckos are the 
largest animals who can reli-
ably scale smooth, vertical 
walls using their adhesive 
footpads. Larger animals 
would need far more pads 
covering their body’s surface 
area to perform the same kind 
of climbing endeavors. 
The study, published in 
PNAS, found that the percent-
age of body surface covered 
in padding increases with 
body size for all climbing ani-
mals, from spiders and mites 
to larger animals like geckos. 
Research from the University 
of Cambridge’s Department 
of Zoology postulates that 
humans would need about 
40 percent of their total body 
surface covered in sticky pads 
to mimic the climbing abili-
ties of geckos. This translates 
to roughly 80 percent of one’s 
frontal body. This research 
has implications on the feasi-
bility of large-scale adhesives.

HOW THINGS WORKInternet networks connect users through complex method
JONATHAN CALVELLO
Staffwriter
Since the creation of the 
Internet, humans have been 
able to harness it for great 
purposes, such as creating 
databases of knowledge, 
providing pathways of com-
munication, and—most im-
portantly—streaming Net?ix. 
However, there is a lot that oc-
curs between the time when 
you click on the Internet icon 
and when the browser pops 
up. Connecting to the Inter-
net involves a complicated 
integration of hardware and 
software, especially to con-
nect across platforms — syn-
ching a phone to a computer, 
for instance.
To get online, a user needs 
to have a device that can con-
nect with the Internet. An 
electronic device can be de-
signed to sync to another de-
vice based on the hardware it 
contains, thereby generating 
a network, or connection, be-
tween devices. The Internet is 
a large web of these networks. 
It provides a pathway through 
which millions of different 
electronic devices can con-
nect to and interact with one 
another.
Because the Internet is ac-
cessed by millions of different 
electronic devices, it has to 
be governed by certain uni-
versal protocols to make sure 
all the devices can talk to one 
another. These protocols are 
implemented into both the 
hardware and software of In-
ternet accessing devices. The 
Internet itself is not a physical 
entity, rather a set of proto-
cols through which electronic 
devices can access each other.
These protocols involve 
Internet Protocol (IP) ad-
dresses, which are analogous 
to street addresses. Much like 
a house needs an address to 
send and receive mail, each 
computer requires an IP ad-
dress in order to identify 
where to send information 
and where said information 
came from. An IP address is 
not built into a computer; 
instead, IP addresses are as-
signed to various geographi-
cal locations by an organi-
zation called the Internet 
Assigned Numbers Authority 
(IANA). These IP addresses 
can change from time to time. 
But certain devices, such as 
an Internet server for a com-
pany like Verizon, require 
constant, ef?cient connec-
tion to the Internet. In order 
to provide this, IANA assigns 
static IP addresses for these 
devices.
Once a connection has 
been established between the 
start point and the end point 
of a message, a pathway must 
be provided along which the 
data can be transmitted from 
sender to receiver. When 
a message gets sent across 
computers, the software in 
the sender computer actually 
breaks the message down into 
smaller chunks of data called 
packets. When it does so, it 
assigns an IP address to each 
packet to indicate where the 
message must be sent.
To reach the receiver, 
these packets travel through 
various devices called rout-
ers, which deliver the mes-
sage to its proper destination 
by reading the IP address of 
each packet and forwarding it 
along to a router closer to the 
destination. Packets are sent 
across millions of different 
routers—each with varying 
ef?ciency and strength—and 
because of this, packets can 
be delivered in any random-
ized order. To overcome this 
obstacle, the sender com-
puter embeds a serial number 
within each packet of data to 
identify its place in the entire 
message. This way, when the 
receiver computer receives all 
these packets, it can reassem-
ble them correctly to produce 
the proper message.
The number of different 
paths a packet can take across 
routers are nearly in?nite, 
and the same path is almost 
never repeated. Addition-
ally, speci?c devices at the 
edges of the Internet pathway 
provide data transmission 
between the computer and 
router media. These devices 
are provided by organizations 
called Internet Service Pro-
viders, which act as the con-
nection between a user and 
the Internet.
The Internet is analogous 
to a mailing service: it takes a 
message containing a destina-
tion address and the sender’s 
address and provides the me-
dium through which this in-
formation is delivered. As we 
continue designing technolo-
gies which are capable of in-
teracting and communicating 
with each other, we continue 
to improve convenience and 
usability across  platforms.

Barth explained that 
this new machine learning      
technique allows research-
ers to rapidly count and 
compare different animals’ 
brains across different con-
ditions to see what part of 
the circuit changes when the 
input is altered. 
A study of the data re-
veals that, when the sensory 
input that arrived at the 
brain was changed, the den-
sity of synapses across layers 
changed. The density of ob-
servable synapses increased 
or decreased and in some 
cases, synapses even be-
came longer. These longer 
synapses had not been visu-
alized before. 
Barth explained that “by 
using machine learning to 
do the work for us, we are 
breaking open the direc-
tion that we want to go and 
expanding the areas of the 
brain that we want to focus 
on.”
An invention disclo-
sure has been filed for this     
technique, and Barth be-

for this technique to be used 
as a tool for medical diagno-

Hyperloop design presentation shows students’ progress
and slow down the pod.
One of the most enter-
prising features of the Carn-
egie Mellon Hyperloop team’s 
progress is that they do not 
seem to be phased by obsta-
cles. Every time the team en-
countered a particular com-
ponent that was nowhere to 
be found on the free market, 
they created their own; from 
the air bearing system to the 
air storage tank to the re-pur-
posed helicopter compressor, 
the designs are one-of-a-kind. 
For every problem, it seems, 
the team is working on a fea-
sible solution.
The CMU Hyperloop team 
will travel to Texas A&M Uni-
versity this coming weekend, 
Jan. 29-30, to present their 
designs to SpaceX and Tesla 
engineers in an attempt to 
move into the ?nal round of 
prototype construction and 
the ?nal race event in June.

CON: Scapegoat Debbie W.S. should not be ousted 
The two ?ashpoints giving rise to 
the campaign against Debbie Was-
serman Schultz around – the debate 
schedule and the ?ap with the Sand-
ers campaign over the NGP VAN – 
are not suf?cient to prove favoritism.
The debate schedule is lacking, 
but there are reasons besides locking 
down a Clinton nomination for the 
debate schedule to be sparse. Saying 
this shows favoritism for Clinton re-
lies on the notion that debates would 
hurt Hillary Clinton’s campaign. 
That is unlikely. After most debates 
in 2008, she came out about the 
same as President Obama did, land-
ing a few victories and a few losses. 
However, both Obama and Clinton 
are talented debaters. There was no 
reason to believe Senator (D-VT) 
Bernie Sanders or Maryland Gover-
nor Martin O’Malley would get the 
better of Clinton. That view has been 
mostly justi?ed. Despite a small slip 
after the most recent debate, Clin-
ton has mostly steamrolled her op-
ponents in these debates, grabbing 
decisive victories according to live 
interview polling numbers (internet 
polls invite all sorts of biases, so their 
declaration that Sanders has won 
each debate is useless information). 
In fact, Sanders has been steadily 
gaining on Clinton, but stumbles af-
ter each debate comprise most of the 
gap between the two.
A lack of unsanctioned debates 
has shrunk the schedule, despite the 
number of sanctioned debates be-
ing about the same as in years past. 
Unsanctioned debates can become 
nightmares for the party participat-
ing. As campaigns heat up and get 
nasty, attacks get personal and harm 
candidates in the general more than 
they help candidates in the primary. 
Further, people have a talent to turn 
everything into a scandal, and nearly 
every debate in 2008 was followed 
by rumors of Clinton favoritism. 
Debates in the primary are a risk, 
but can be controlled when they are 
sanctioned. It’s likely Schultz was 
protecting the ?eld here and not just 
her friend.
The second ?restorm regarding 
the DNC’s reaction to the NGP VAN’s 
system breach was baf?ing. After 
unlawful activity by the Sanders 
campaign’s data director, the Sand-
ers campaign managed to spin it into 
“the DNC is silencing us!” and got 
off without so much as a sweep to 
make sure the ?les were deleted. It’s 
easily possible that the staffer stole 
millions of dollars worth of polling 
numbers. If a tool is being used to 
break the law, the user loses access. 
It’s that simple. People go to jail 
over these kinds of situations. The 
fact that nothing happened doesn’t 
show Clinton favoritism, it shows 
that the DNC cares more about pub-
licity than responsible enforcement 
of rules. This may be bad, but it’s 
not favoritism.
In the end, Schultz has presided 
over an era of endless frustration for 
liberal Democrats as they lose seats 
in Congress and watch their policy 
agenda be shredded by obstruction-
ist Republicans. This may be Schul-
tz’s fault (it probably isn’t, but that is 
a different debate entirely), but the 
witch hunt to declare her an under-
cover Clinton operative is simply not 
productive.
PRO: Debbie Wasserman-Schultz should leave DNC
Frustrated Democrats have 
brought a laundry list of complaints 
against Democratic National Com-
mittee (DNC) Chairwoman Debbie 
Wasserman-Schultz for her conduct 
as Chairwoman since 2011. And re-
cently, these frustrations have boiled 
over into the call for her resignation 
as chairwoman of the DNC. The al-
legations brought against her re?ect 
not only the possibility that she is 
personally biased towards Hillary 
Clinton, but also her failure to unite 
and lead the Democratic party.
Prior to the ?restorm that be-
gan to rage surrounding the 2016 
primaries, Wasserman-Schultz re-
ceived heavy criticism for leading 
the democrats to two consecutive, 
signi?cant congressional losses. 
In 2012, Democrats managed to 
hang on to the majority in the Sen-
ate, but maintained the minority 
in the House. With the loss of both 
the House and the Senate in 2014, 
however, Democrat progress has 
been held at a standstill. President 
Obama cannot pass meaningful pro-
gressive change without the help of 
Congress; he can only continue to 
threaten veto against the progress 
that has already been made. Was-
serman-Schultz’s leadership has let 
down the party.
Since 2014, there have been se-
rious claims asserting that she has 
exhibited an inappropriate level of 
favoritism toward the Clinton cam-
paign. Many progressives cite that 
Wasserman-Schultz only scheduled 
six sanctioned debates leading up 
to the primaries (half of which were 
aired on Saturday nights and con-
?icted with NFL games) compared 
to 2008’s much larger 26 debates. 
There are claims that this confus-
ing change was made in order to 
protect Clinton from the possibility 
of loss, and so that, even if she did 
lose, there wouldn’t be enough peo-
ple watching to notice. These claims 
have been rejected by the DNC.
This decision also puts the entire 
Democratic party at a disadvantage 
when compared to the Republican 
debate schedule. Their debates are 
held during primetime spots on 
large networks. The Republican 
candidates have been getting more 
publicity, and not just because they 
say outrageous things, but because 
the DNC is simply not supporting its 
candidates.
Additionally, there is the miscon-
duct surrounding Bernie Sanders’ 
staffers illegally accessing the Clin-
ton campaign’s polling information. 
The DNC shut off the Sanders cam-
paign’s access to the NGP VAN after 
a data breach in which the Sanders 
campaign’s data director accessed 
and possibly downloaded propri-
etary Clinton campaign polling ?les, 
which are private information. The 
Sanders campaign defends that this 
was not planned or sanctioned, but 
was due to a malfunction in NGP 
VAN’s systems. The campaign alert-
ed the DNC to the security issue, 
and promptly ?red the staffer. Yet 
before investigating these claims, 
the DNC’s response was to suspend 
Sanders’ access to the committee’s 
voter database. This affected his 
campaign to the tune of six ?gures 
in potential donations lost.
While the Sanders campaign is 
responsible for the conduct of its 
workers, Wasserman-Schultz and 
the DNC are also responsible for up-
holding the contract. According to 
Salon, the contract requires a writ-
ten notice for suspension from the 
voter database, plus a 10-day grace 
period in order for the campaign to 
right its wrongs, which it did imme-
diately. The suspension, without re-
gard for this contract, unnecessarily 
deprived Sanders’ run for the Demo-
cratic ticket of millions in funds, giv-
ing Hillary an undeserved edge.
Even if these two allegations do 
not stand up under investigation, 
there is the simple fact that a large 
faction of the voter base does not 
trust her. Having lost this support, 
she cannot function as an effective 
leader and will never be able to 
unite the Democratic party.
 In an election year that means 
so much for the future of America, 
the DNC needs to stand together 
behind a set of common goals in 
order to protect the country from a 
right-wing reign of terror. Debbie 
Wasserman-Schultz is not the chair-
person who can lead Democrats to a 
White House victory in 2016, and by 
standing her ground and fueling the 
?ames of in?ghting, she is doing her 
party more harm than good.
Administration raises tuition, students fail to raise protests 
SINEAD FOLEY
The tuition hikes announced last 
week did not come as a shock to any-
one, but the resounding lack of re-
sponse should have. Carnegie Mel-
lon has been consistently raising its 
tuition by around 3 percent for the 
past ?ve years. Looking at the same 
?ve years, I can ?nd no evidence of 
mass protests against these increas-
es, or demanding ?scal transparency 
from the university. There are, of 
course, valid and important reasons 
to raise tuition, but Carnegie Mellon 
does not provide detailed informa-
tion about where the money is go-
ing, leaving students in the dark. By 
staying silent and not demanding to 
be informed, the student body is re-
linquishing control over their mon-
ey, institution, and the form their 
education takes.
No one would argue that running 
a top-tier academic institution is 
cheap. There are salaries to be paid, 
both to faculty and staff, facilities to 
be built and maintained, equipment 
to be bought, and research projects 
to be funded. Obtaining enough 
funds to keep the university running 
and improving is particularly dif-
?cult here at Carnegie Mellon due 
to a remarkably small endowment 
of $1.599 billion in 2014. Carnegie 
Mellon is a young university, so it 
has not had the time to accumulate 
the massive endowments that back 
schools like Stanford and MIT. At 
the same time, Carnegie Mellon is 
rivaling with these universities for 
students and faculty. This leaves the 
school struggling to keep pace in 
terms of salaries, bene?ts, and facil-
ities, all on a lower budget. Tuition 
needs to be raised so that Carnegie 
Mellon can stay competitive. This 
argument seems to hold water. Ev-
eryone who is going here wants the 
best education possible, and even 
improvements that don’t directly 
affects us add prestige and value to 
our degrees.
However, it is all a question of 
balance. Prestige and quality educa-
tion is all well and good, but it only 
bene?ts people who can afford it. 
Carnegie Mellon should be trying to 
improve, but not at the cost of stu-
dents being able to attend or their 
families being able to maintain ?-
nancial security. Next year the class 
of 2017 will pay $50,690 in tuition. 
When they committed to Carnegie 
Mellon in the fall of 2012 their tu-
ition was $45,760. Families made 
decisions and ?scal plans based on 
the 2012 number, and are now hav-
ing to ?nd an extra $4,930. This 
is a problem for every year in our 
school. My year, the class of 2018, 
is already facing a tuition bill that is 
$3,166 more than when we started, 
and that is before food and housing 
costs are accounted for.
I have heard a few responses jus-
tifying these increases for people 
who are already committed to the 
school. The ?rst argument, that 
comes almost exclusively from oth-
er members of the student body, is 
that if people don’t want to pay the 
increase they can leave Carnegie 
Mellon. The issue with this argu-
ment is that it turns Carnegie Mel-
lon into a place only accessible to 
people with thousands of dollars 
to spare, and that it discounts the 
lives, connections, and plans that 
people have built in their time at 
Carnegie Mellon. The second argu-
ment, frequently cited in newspaper 
interviews with college administra-
tions, is that tuition increases are 
necessary to keep up with in?ation. 
The issue with this is that tuition in-
creases in the past decade have not 
re?ected in?ation. In 2006 Carnegie 
Mellon tuition was $34,180. Accord-
ing to the US In?ation Calculator if 
tuition had simply been keeping up 
with in?ation it should have been 
$40,184 in 2015, a full $10,000 less 
than tuition for the 2015–2016 aca-
demic year. Clearly, there is some-
thing else at work.
The “something else” would 
seem to be increasing operating ex-
penses, which, for example, grew by 
3.1 percent or $32.1 million in 2013 
according to the 2014 Financial Re-
port. Much of this was covered by 
a $28.5 million increase in revenue 
from tuition and other educational 
fees, net of ?nancial aid. In the re-
port operating expenses are broken 
down into six categories: instruc-
tion and departmental research, 
sponsored projects, administration 
and institutional support, academic 
support, student services, and aux-
iliary services and activities. I could 
not ?nd a more detailed breakdown 
of the spending. Perhaps there is a 
more detailed breakdown available. 
Perhaps everything that is in each 
of those categories is completely 
necessary and something we as stu-
dents should be supporting. Perhaps 
every dollar of extra tuition we pay 
is directly contributing to a better 
academic environment for us, now, 
and not only for future students. 
However, the information neces-
sary to make those calls isn’t easily 
available to the student body so we 
cannot make informed decisions or 
have any kind of say about where 
our money goes.
The most startling thing about all 
of this is the extreme lack of protest 
on campus. While some amount of 
tuition increase is probably neces-
sary, there are many things that can 
be done to make them more fair and 
equitable, and perhaps smaller. We 
could protest for ?nancial transpar-
ency so that students can ensure that 
money is being spent on things they 
want and care about. We could de-
mand that tuition be ?xed when you 
enter Carnegie Mellon, so that each 
student pays the same cost all four 
years, allowing families to make in-
formed ?nancial plans. Or we could 
petition for better ?nancial-aid op-
portunities for students already en-
rolled in Carnegie Mellon, such as 
the right to apply for the new merit 
scholarships that were made avail-
able to incoming students last year 
to account for the rise in tuition but 
barred to those already enrolled.
Carnegie Mellon students were 
not always so willing to accept 
cost increases. In 2009 students 
throughout Pittsburgh, including at 
Carnegie Mellon, signed petitions 
and attended city council meetings 
to protest a proposed one percent 
tax on tuition. Why should we ?ght 
against a 1 percent increase in tu-
ition cost, but not a 3.2 percent one? 
As a campus, we need to take a stand 
on tuition and create a dialogue 
with the administration about the 
purposes, processes, and expecta-
tions for tuition increases.

YouTube beauty guru culture rede?nes beauty standards
GOWRI SUNDER
Junior Staffwriter
The culture of YouTube beauty 
gurus has exploded and surpasses 
the viewership of many forms of 
traditional media. These gurus are 
generally entrepreneurial women in 
their twenties trying to get in on the 
oversaturated beauty genre of new 
media. As role models in a platform 
that allows for greater diversity, they 
ideally offer the potential for ex-
panding the concept of beauty, but 
also the potential to reinforce nega-
tive values from the beauty industry 
in a space where the audience tends 
to be especially vulnerable. Leading 
content creators, despite their limit-
ed diversity, appear to be attempting 
to change the culture of fashion and 
beauty to be about having fun and as 
expressions of self con?dence, rather 
than making them the source of self 
esteem.
The women who do stand out 
owe their fame in part to luck and 
good timing, but also because they 
were able to differentiate themselves 
through what they call “lifestyle 
vlogging.” What that means is that 
as much as the videos are about the 
quality of product reviews and tutori-
als, they build the fame of the beauty 
gurus around a cult of personality. 
Branding themselves as a friend or 
big sister who gives you beauty tips, 
relationship advice, and encourage-
ment creates trust and loyalty within 
their fans. 
The success of this branding is 
evident in the amount of press these 
young women get. Ingrid Nilsen re-
cently met with President Barack 
Obama to discuss issues important 
to her fan base; Zoella broke sale 
records with her new line of beauty 
products; Tanya Burr was on the cov-
er of Glamour magazine; their meet 
and greets bring together young 
people from all over the world; and 
the list of high-pro?le achievements 
goes on and on.
Given the in?uence of the beauty 
gurus, a lot of people are beginning 
to question what kind of impact they 
have on young girls. The beauty in-
dustry is notoriously toxic for young 
girls, given that their marketing 
strategy involves establishing insecu-
rity by displaying unattainable stan-
dards of beauty as the norm. Photo-
shopped bikini bodies and poreless 
skin create a false need for diet pills 
and makeup, con?ating beauty with 
success, self worth, and likeability. 
The world basically tells young girls 
that you have to look like Karlie 
Kloss to be worthy of relationships 
and friends, and if you don’t look like 
her, then you’d better start investing 
in products to make yourself look 
conventionally attractive. And while 
our media and society also promote 
ridiculous standards of masculinity 
as well, in general they aren’t speci?-
cally targeted by the beauty industry 
in the same way. Part of the indus-
try’s marketing is creating a rigid 
gender divide that expects women to 
be more concerned about ?xing their 
appearance. 
Growing concern of the effect 
this has on young girls’ self images 
has led to a slew of studies on media 
and self-objecti?cation — the ten-
dency for women to view themselves 
based on what others would see and 
be attracted to — which generally 
conclude that these in?uences are 
strongly correlated with depression, 
anxiety, and eating disorders. The 
problems with beauty, fashion, and 
diet industries are pretty well known 
and established, so the question that 
needs to be answered now is to what 
degree does the beauty guru culture 
subvert the more traditional culture 
of beauty.
Where YouTube and other forms 
of new media appear to have power 
is in their democratic approach to 
media. Anyone can publish anything 
that they want, as long as they use a 
Taylor Swift song. And this illusion 
that anyone can make it as a You-
Tube star is interesting because on 
one hand it does allow, in theory, for 
greater diversity in terms of repre-
sentation, but it can also be an illu-
sion. 
In reality, the vast majority of 
the biggest beauty gurus are young, 
thin, white, cisgender, heterosexual 
women. So when you watch life-
style advice or “A Day in My Life” 
on YouTube, what you get is repeti-
tion of a lifestyle that is predicated 
on being conventionally pretty and 
wealthy enough to buy organic foods 
and mountains of lip gloss. It means 
that if a person of color goes online 
to watch a haul video (videos where 
people show and tell about their re-
cent shopping purchases), chances 
are they’ll be watching someone ex-
pound on the trendiness of “tribal 
prints” and kimonos. Tribal prints, 
by the way, generally refer to fabric 
prints inspired from South American 
designs, African fabric, and Indian 
woodblock printed fabric. 
The fascination with the Bohe-
mian and ignorance of other cultures 
is concerning, and at times genuine-
ly confusing, but it is a re?ection of 
the way that fashion in the Western 
world is being marketed. Similarly, 
the values presented in boyfriend 
advice videos and workout tutorials 
and “What I Eat in a Day” videos dis-
play the same cultural expectations 
of normal that old media presented, 
just in a more personalized, and in-
sidious, way. In general, these videos 
tend to be well intentioned, but it is 
concerning that there is a message 
that these videos are about real peo-
ple keeping it real. People think the 
lives and values portrayed in these 
videos are the norm, when they are 
often unattainable. 
On the other hand, in comparison 
to traditional media, there is actually 
some diversity in the representation 
of beauty, gender expression, and 
health. Michelle Phan is probably the 
queen of beauty gurus, but in the tra-
ditional fashion and beauty industry 
she may not have been able to have 
her career because of her race. 
Estée Lalonde and SprinkleofGlit-
ter (also known as Louise Pentland), 
for example, talk about their own 
struggles with body image while also 
showing their audiences that they 
love their body and feel good in it. 
Louise Pentland especially ?lls the 
need to talk about body image and 
beauty, as she has released a line 
of beautiful plus sized clothing and 
several fun, glamorous lookbooks 
to counter the perception that be-
ing plus sized should mean that you 
can’t be beautiful. SunKissAlba’s 
channel talks about sustainability 
and organic products, but also de-
scribes a beauty regime that would 
be more speci?c to people of color. 
Kaushal Beauty makes makeup tu-
torials for both Indian and Western 
events, which is helpful because she 
uses colors that are more ?attering 
on brown people.
Ingrid Nilsen is a huge lifestyle 
vlogger who not only is biracial, but 
also publicly came out last year. This 
was huge for a lot of people because 
it was a way for a lot of people to see 
that identifying as a lesbian while 
also being feminine, fashionable, 
not white, beautiful, and ultimately 
the same person is okay and even 
normal. You see this a lot with new 
media representation of LGBTQA+ 
individuals; often the most powerful 
way of breaking down stereotypes 
and building self acceptance in mar-
ginalized groups is showing people 
just living their life and being happy.
All of these YouTubers have huge 
audiences, and although it is gener-
ally not the case that people of mar-
ginalized groups have as large of a 
fan base, their ability to reach a lot 
of people with their identity is im-
portant. It is no less important that 
anyone can ?nd small YouTubers 
who put out messages about diver-
sity in self love and beauty that more 
or less align with their own identity 
— and that is something that is spe-
cial about YouTube, vlogging, and 
speci?cally lifestyle videos.
Beyond increased representation, 
what distinguishes the beauty guru 
platform from traditional media is 
how personal the content is. To a 
lot of young girls, these women are 
like big sisters or best friends who 
they ask for advice on fashion, boys, 
cooking, con?dence, and how to be 
healthy. Whether you look at the 
love that came in response to Zoella’s 
videos about her panic disorder and 
managing anxiety, Ingrid Nilsen’s 
videos about periods, or Tanya Burr’s 
daily vlogs, you see these women 
building a really strong relationship 
with their fans. 
This turns out to be a really good 
thing because it allows these women 
to give advice on topics that are gen-
erally taboo or ignored, but are re-
ally important for young women to 
talk about. But while their popular-
ity is built in part on their charisma 
Pittsburgh aims high with decriminalization
EMMETT ELDRED
On Monday, Dec. 21, the Pitts-
burgh City Council voted 7-2 to de-
criminalize small amounts of mari-
juana. Before the law was passed, 
marijuana possession was punish-
able by up to 30 days in jail and a 
$500 ?ne. Now, when police catch 
someone in possession of under 30 
grams of marijuana, they will con-
?scate the drug and assess up to a 
$100 ?ne. No jail time.
The Pittsburgh City Council made 
the right decision, and they deserve 
recognition and praise for it. At the 
same time, we should demand even 
more from our city council and our 
elected of?cials at all levels of gov-
ernment: full legalization.
Legalizing marijuana nationwide 
would save taxpayers billions of 
dollars on the futile War on Drugs. 
Every year, federal, state, and local 
governments spend as much as $50 
billion policing drug use, especially 
marijuana. Imagine if we could in-
stead use that money to build new 
schools, ?x America’s crumbling 
infrastructure, or even reinvest it 
into drug prevention and addiction 
treatment programs. That’s to say 
nothing of the additional tax rev-
enue that a legal marijuana mar-
ket would generate. According to a 
study by the Cato Institute, legaliz-
ing marijuana would generate $8.7 
billion in tax revenue. Legalization 
would also empower police to ad-
dress real matters of public safety. 
Decriminalization and legalization 
enable police to focus less on low-
level offenders and focus more on 
dealers, gangs, and cartels, forces 
that really do harm the public and 
deserve undivided attention.
Pittsburgh’s move to decriminal-
ize marijuana will keep people out 
of already crowded jails. The United 
States incarcerates more of its own 
citizens than any other country, even 
China, an authoritarian state with 
over three times as many citizens. 
As many as 50 percent of America’s 
prisoners are nonviolent offenders, 
usually for drug possession. Legal-
izing marijuana nationwide would 
keep millions of people from going 
to prison every year, and can save 
lives, communities, and money.
Perhaps the most important rea-
son to support legalization, though, 
is the clear racism in the way mari-
juana use is policed. Let’s face it, a 
lot of white, middle-class kids at 
Carnegie Mellon smoke marijuana, 
but I doubt that many Carnegie Mel-
lon students worried much about 
getting a $500 ?ne for possession. 
According to a 2013 study by the 
ACLU, even though white people 
and black people use marijuana at 
the same rate, black people are four 
times more likely to be arrested for 
possessing marijuana than other 
groups. For white people, using 
marijuana comes with a slap on the 
wrist. For black people, it can derail 
your entire life. While decriminal-
ization is a step forward towards 
equal treatment, the ?ne can still be 
applied to perpetuate systemic rac-
ism. Decriminalization and legaliza-
tion help ensure that the law is ap-
plied fairly to everyone.
Pittsburgh took a huge step for-
ward when City Council voted to de-
criminalize small amounts of mari-
juana. The move will save taxpayers 
money, make the streets safer, de-
populate jails, and promote racial 
justice. However, while we applaud 
City Council, we must acknowledge 
that any journey is more than the 
?rst step forward. Now that we have 
forward momentum, we must work 
even harder to make marijuana le-
gal.

This letter was addressed to David 
Kosbie, instructor of 15-112, the intro-
ductory programming class at Carn-
egie Mellon. The letter poses questions 
about technology, social good, and 
whether the two actually correlate.
Dear Professor Kosbie,
You said in class that you were 
purposefully trying to hide your poli-
tics from us. Having just completed 
your class, I am kindly going to ask 
you questions that will require you to 
do otherwise. Not because I am curi-
ous, but because I am in desperate 
need of some perspective. 
I had no real programming expe-
rience prior to taking 112 this fall. I 
come from a culture where program-
ming hasn’t become a “thing” yet, es-
pecially not at the high-school level. 
In fact, it is mostly associated with 
dull positions in the IT departments 
that existed since the 80’s. Therefore, 
I think you can recognize the cul-
ture shock I experienced coming to 
a place like Carnegie Mellon to study 
engineering. I was not sure at ?rst I 
could ?t in.
112 was de?nitely daunting at 
?rst, but I came to enjoy the rigor and 
creativity involved, and ended up do-
ing ?ne. I was hoping that excelling 
at your class would make me feel as 
though I belong here, but it didn’t. 
I like to ask questions, and for some 
reason, that did not go well with be-
ing in an environment full of talented 
people whose sole purpose in life 
was to create technology. There were 
times when I felt depressed. But un-
like most people at this institution, 
you seem to understand that technol-
ogy is not intrinsically valuable, but 
worthwhile, as long as it promotes 
the interests of humankind.
You told us from the ?rst day that 
you did not leave your high-paying 
corporate job to teach at Carnegie 
Mellon for your love of “for loops.” 
Throughout the semester, you tried 
to disillusion us about material pur-
suits, and encouraged us to pro-
gram for social good. You did this 
in a packed schedule in which every 
minute counted. Your sincerity and 
optimism made me and many others 
stick with 112. I also do like for loops, 
however.
But the world is an ugly place, and 
I’m sure you would agree. Despite all 
of our economic and technological 
“progress,” extreme poverty exits, 
and is perhaps more widespread than 
ever. While asking us to volunteer 
for Stop Hunger Now, you yourself 
admitted that it is unacceptable that 
there can be hunger in a city like 
Pittsburgh. We are constantly be-
ing told that we have the power to 
change things, and it has some truth 
to it, if Carnegie Mellon students do 
not have the capacity to make a social 
impact through technology, I don’t 
know who else does. I have been here 
long, enough to realize, however, 
that most of us choose not to.
Big companies attract top talent, 
they always have. But let’s look at 
what the companies who frequently 
“farm” Carnegie Mellon grads are re-
ally doing. Facebook devises more ef-
?cient ways to get us to click on ads, 
Google cracks our search patterns to 
?gure out what we might want to buy 
in the ?rst place, Uber and Airbnb 
drive the existing service industry 
out of business by avoiding regula-
tion. Not only that, but they actually 
drive people out of their homes, be-
ing on the forefront of the gentri?ca-
tion movement all across America. 
And these are not the worst ones, in 
fact, these are the ones frequently 
glori?ed for their attempts at social 
responsibility. But desirable urban 
space is rapidly becoming inacces-
sible to anyone without a six-?gure 
salary. Entire cultures disappear. 
Class con?ict is at an all-time high, 
surpassing that prior to the Great 
Depression. I’m really not sure how 
much philanthropy can compensate 
for that.
If any and all technology we create 
can somehow be used for socially det-
rimental purposes, how can we keep 
ourselves motivated? Can we really 
class ourselves responsible citizens 
when the traditional path to success 
as developers requires an indiffer-
ence to what a society actually needs? 
Can we live with ourselves when we 
are so ready to blindly follow that 
path? How can we ever reconcile our 
love for solving puzzles and making a 
genuine social impact?
These are the thoughts plaguing 
my mind as I’m on the Pennsylvanian 
43, about to start my second semes-
ter of college. Perhaps it is unfair of 
me to seek your guidance on such a 
topic, and I’m not sure if we are on 
the same page. But you seem to be my 
best shot, and I had to take it. Oh, and 
this train also happens to take 9 hours 
to reach Pittsburgh, and I don’t have 
much else to work on.
Best,
Alp
Although Professor Kosbie agreed 
that this is “the question,” and that we 
should be asking it in a rich variety of 
ways, he still believes that the letter cap-
tures only the “half-truth.” Technology 
is amoral in itself, and it can be used for 
good, just like it can be used for achiev-
ing horrendous deeds. Yet any attempt 
to block out technology will not make 
bad technology go away. The challenge 
is creating positive social impact, and 
then lies in ?nding the right puzzle to 
solve. He also added that the priorities 
of people change over time, tending to 
get less sel?sh as they begin to observe 
what is truly important in life.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR
Black experiences overlooked at CMU 
Our university prides itself on 
using collaboration as a gateway to 
innovation. This is evident in our 
group work oriented classes as we 
are taught that teamwork is a criti-
cal skill to have, yet we fail to take 
responsibility for our teammates. In-
stead their issues are there own. For 
too long we have deemed our class-
mates lack of “success” their prob-
lem. This is no different from mak-
ing racial issues faced by blacks also 
“their problem”. We have miserably 
failed to see that problems faced by 
our fellow peers are our problem as 
well. The success of the group is not 
based on one or a majority of the 
individuals, but the collective. The 
same line of thinking should be ad-
opted when considering the injustic-
es faced by POC in particular blacks. 
Helping me, not doing it all for me, 
or being concerned about my issues 
does not in any capacity have nega-
tive repercussion to you. Helping 
someone that is behind does not 
impede your ability to learn more; 
in fact taking time to help someone 
with a part they don’t understand 
only helps you learn better. It seems 
as though it is taboo to talk about 
two very relevant B words: 1. black 
2. blind. Well I ?nally have the au-
dacity to do so. Numerous students, 
faculty and administrators turn a 
blind eye to the fact that CMU poorly 
represents and treats black students.
Let’s ?rst consider the state of 
black students here at CMU. There 
are more people that look like me 
in the dining locations and custo-
dial roles than there are in my own 
classrooms. I can name all of the 
professors that are black, as I have 
had the privilege of being taught 
by all but two of the six professors. 
In 2001, roughly 3% CMU’s faculty 
was black. The numbers are not 
drastically higher compared to the 
most recent data. In 2012, 1.8% of 
eligible black tenured and tenured 
faculty was black. That’s a 1.2% 
increase in 11 years. We need to 
do better. CMU uses the diversity 
card as a way to attract more stu-
dents and donors, but how can we 
claim diversity when the statistics 
prove otherwise? Maybe we should 
be speci?c by what we mean by di-
versity. Is it amongst international 
students or academic interest? It’s 
certainly not a large amount of ra-
cial or ethnic diversity. The question 
now becomes why has the black ex-
perience at CMU not changed very 
much. The truth is I have no clue but 
that does not warrant the tendency 
to ignore the issue, which is why I 
demand we earnestly consider how 
we got to where we are today and 
how to make rapid and signi?cant 
progress. What will it take for non 
black students and administration 
alike to see how ignoring blackness 
and covert racism is in fact condon-
ing it? When will we start to see that 
not caring for our fellow peers and 
classmates is our issue? We as an 
institution should be responsible 
for the lack of the unpleasant ex-
perience of our fellow classmates, 
especially for black students. Stand-
ing up for issues faced by blacks is 
like a group project, you are evalu-
ated on the input of all of the people 
not on the individual contribution. 
Blacks can continue to ?ght to end 
the injustices they face, but having 
non black allies will result in a more 
widespread and effective resolution 
of these issues.

Why doesn’t CMU care for black people?
A great man of action once said, 
“Education is our passport to the 
future, for tomorrow belongs to the 
people who prepare for it today.” 
That great man of action was El-
Hajj Malik El-Shabazz, formally and 
most commonly known to the world 
as Malcolm X. I want to be able to 
travel to that future that Shabazz 
talks about, but how can I prepare 
for it if I am unsure whether or not 
the institution that is facilitating my 
“education” cares about me?
There has been much attention 
brought to the many racial issues 
that still exist on college campuses 
around the country by many mem-
bers of the CMU community. How-
ever, no one seems willing to ac-
knowledge the many racial issues 
that still exist at Carnegie Mellon 
that are affecting black students. 
We, CMU in general, as a commu-
nity have never really heard from 
the administration whether or not 
the well-being and success of black 
students on campus is a priority for 
the school.
Black students in America have 
been systematically oppressed by 
the educational system. Those who 
are fortunate enough to be accepted 
into CMU slowly realize that system-
ic oppression is still affecting them.
Many of the black students at 
CMU, including myself, come from 
inner city schools. These inner city 
schools have a history of provid-
ing sub-par education and have the 
nerve to say that their “graduates” 
are prepared for college. For a good 
portion of these inner city students, 
going to college means escaping in-
stitutional racism stemming from 
slavery, that corners them into the 
never ending cycle of poverty and 
struggle. However, even at a school 
as progressive as Carnegie Mellon, 
why are my fellow black brothers 
and sisters and I still experiencing 
the same racism and indifference 
from students, faculty and staff that 
our inner city schools taught us was 
over after the civil rights movement 
of the 50s and 60s?
Many incidents occur at CMU 
that just get swept under the rug by 
CMU’s amazing PR team or by stu-
dents too afraid to speak up. Rac-
ism, sexual assault, gender harass-
ment, alcohol abuse, drug abuse are 
just a few of the issues that continue 
to affect many students on campus 
yet the Carnegie Mellon adminis-
tration never really comes out and 
explicitly admits that there are 
problems and that they are going 
to solve it or at least try to make it 
better. Instead the administration is 
very quick to protect its image at the 
expense of the students by making 
general statements about “diversity 
and inclusion” without ever explain-
ing what “diversity and inclusion” 
really means.
Why am I writing all of this? I 
am writing this because there are so 
many issues at Carnegie Mellon and 
I do not feel that the administra-
tion truly cares and I feel that many 
within the campus community are 
ignorant to these issues. I encourage 
CMU students that the next time 
you see a black student on campus, 
ask them if they have experienced 
some form of racism on campus. I 
assure you that you will be surprised 
by their answers. Hopefully by more 
students becoming aware of one is-
sue, it will lead to awareness of oth-
er issues affecting students.
So I ask the administration this, 
Do you care about the black stu-
dents at CMU? Many of us are curi-
ous to know. And I am sure students 
of other communities are curious if 
you care about them as well.
I will leave you with another 
quote from Mr. Shabazz, “Usually 
when people are sad, they don’t do 
anything. They just cry over their 
condition. But when they get angry, 
they bring about change.” Believe 
me when I say this, if you carefully 
press your ear against the wall, you 
will hear many starting to get angry.

Change
YouTubers shift beauty standards
and caring, their channels are also 
built on a trust for the products they 
use and review. And that’s actually 
how most of the beauty gurus make 
money — companies pay to have 
their products in their video. The 
top three beauty guru’s make an av-
erage of $33,000 a month. 
In a best case scenario, that 
means that these women will work 
out deals that will allow them to be 
paid to show only the products they 
actually want to recommend, and 
their audiences will be more loyal 
because of that. But the biggest is-
sue people have with the beauty 
guru culture is the idea of these 
young fans who unquestioningly 
trust these women who are on some 
level making videos to advertise 
for a variety of brands. With that 
kind of adoration and in?uence, 
there is a possibility that they are 
teaching young girls consumerism 
and super?ciality. 
These videos are a replacement 
for fashion magazines, and it’s ques-
tionable whether young women 
take away a different message. The 
increased representation does mean 
that there are certain messages —es-
pecially about what a woman’s body 
should look like — that become less 
popularized. But these videos are 
still supporting consumerism in an 
idyllic setting, with twinkly lights 
and ?oral bedspreads. 
A lifestyle vlogger, in theory, 
should also be talking about ?scal 
responsibility, sustainability, and 
what a relationship with material 
possession should look like as well 
as what a makeup routine and out?t 
should be. In the same way that a lot 
of white beauty bloggers disregard 
the roots of the clothing they wear 
and the cultural context of their 
out?ts, a lot of these women are not 
considering the environmental im-
pact or ethical responsibility of the 
clothing they buy. Considering that 
most drugstore brands test on ani-
mals, and many factories that make 
the hot new thing in fashion barely 
pay their employees, it is hard to 
separate the problems from the po-
tential good these beauty bloggers 
can do. 
There is also the question of what 
this teaches people who may not 
feel conventionally attractive, but 
also don’t have the money to buy 
beauty products and new clothes. 
It does appear to tell people that 
you can be con?dent, and having all 
this stuff is a really easy way to feel 
good about yourself. Telling people 
to buy products — even if they are 
actually good — for the advertising 
dollars just seems like an oversight 
on the part of YouTubers of the cul-
ture that they are creating.
Hauls, for example, are a partic-
ularly controversial form of lifestyle 
vlog. In hauls, users go shopping 
and earn a few million views show-
ing everyone what they bought for 
themselves. And when successful 
YouTubers get paid to do haul pro-
motions or advertorials, it can come 
across as showing off or narcissistic 
or, at the very least, far removed 
from most people’s ?nancial reality. 
Depending on the way a channel is 
branded, haul videos  can frankly 
appear shallow. It is important to 
not need to be validated by what 
you own and how you look, and 
that’s sometimes dif?cult because 
these things are tied in with like-
ability and social status.
What’s most important here is 
that we keep having conversations 
about how we view makeup and 
fashion’s role in society. In feminist 
circles, the question remains: can 
makeup and fashion be empower-
ing? Is there something negative in 
cultivating a love for sparkly eye-
shadows and ?owy dresses? It is 
worth noting that the idea of culti-
vating a love for beauty products out 
of self love rather than insecurity is 
hugely important, and a wonderful 
side effect of beauty guru culture on 
YouTube. 
You’d be hard pressed to ?nd a 
lifestyle vlogger that hasn’t talked 
about self con?dence, body image, 
or how makeup is more decora-
tion than substance. In most cases, 
these videos are actually about how 
women appropriate something that 
might be seen as oppressive as a way 
to express themselves and make 
themselves feel good, regardless of 
what that boy or anyone else thinks.
If young girls and women are 
modeling their lifestyles after what 
is presented in their videos, the 
hope is that they pick up these mes-
sages as well. The genre is new and 
open enough that people are talk-
ing about these things, about living 
with less and what life is outside of 
the framework of beauty.
If the last few years of YouTube 
culture have shown us anything, 
it’s that a smart, thoughtful con-
tent creator is more than the brands 
they work for or promote. It may not 
be obvious to a casual viewer or to 
someone who isn’t part of the beauty 
guru audience, but ultimately what 
sells is this relationship they have 
with their viewers who look up to 
them, but also hold them account-
able. On the one hand, the toxicity 
of the beauty industry didn’t magi-
cally disappear because Zoella went 
on camera and went through her 
day without makeup. On the other, 
though, there is now this experi-
ence where girls process breakups 
by watching Kayley Melissa’s tutori-
als and braiding each other’s hair, 
wind down from a long work day by 
watching pamper routines, or just 
feel a little more validated in their 
own expressions of beauty.
YOUTUBE, from A9
Oscars re?ect pervasive racism 
CHIE WACH
Junior Staffwriter
Across the nation, movie fans 
are furious. This is a country that is 
drained from decades of struggle 
against culturally-induced racism: 
job discrimination, racial pro?ling, 
white privilege, and similar issues. 
But this is also a country that loves 
to watch movies. So when our in-
justice is illuminated by the bright 
lights of Hollywood, the response is 
ferocious.
The list of nominees for the 2016 
Academy Awards has incited outrage 
due to its lack of diversity, resulting 
in the indignant #OscarsSoWhite 
that has spread across social media. 
The all-white cast of Oscar nominees 
has caused many popular ?gures, 
such as director Spike Lee and ac-
tress Jada Pinkett-Smith, to speak 
out against this racial uniformity 
or to declare a boycott against the 
Oscars.
However, racism is a multi-lay-
ered prejudice. We are all aware of 
the ?ght against conscious racism. 
Conscious racism has been rampant 
throughout most of American his-
tory, scrawled across urban walls 
and federal laws alike. Yet while con-
scious racism is no longer culturally 
accepted, a more current type of rac-
ism is its lingering, still very potent, 
remainder: subconscious racism. 
A hidden, quiet form of ?ickering 
racism born, perhaps, in childhood 
exposure to cultural stereotypes or 
thought patterns; living within an 
unknowing host. This form of preju-
dice is much more subtle, and in that 
way, just as dangerous. This is the 
discrimination that dwells in “Oreo” 
jokes and hoodies, traf?c tickets, and 
police bullets.
No conscientious American 
would consider themselves to be rac-
ist. Police of?cers deny racial pro?l-
ing, but it persists anyway. This is 
because of?cers aren’t targeting peo-
ple who are black, they’re targeting 
people who seem suspicious. But the 
reasoning process that determines 
who’s suspicious and who isn’t oc-
curs at a subconscious level, which 
is where the racial pro?ling takes 
place. Of course, this does not apply 
to all police of?cers, just as it doesn’t 
apply to all plumbers or teachers. Yet 
it applies to enough of?cers to sta-
tistically over-target black citizens 
– and offend many black Americans.
What we should all understand, 
however, is this: if this subtle form of 
racism is unconscious, it may also be 
considered unintentional.
In the same way, the Academy 
Award members did not intention-
ally choose an all-white cast. It takes 
300 members to make a nomination. 
It is likely that few of them—or per-
haps none of them—actively chose 
to nominate only white actors. But 
this is more likely: many of these 
voters grew up watching proli?c, 
accomplished, and white celebrities 
such as Tom Hanks or Meryl Streep, 
and perhaps they’ve unconsciously 
internalized the image of an “Oscar 
winner” as a white actor or actress. 
Thus, when faced with selecting Os-
car nominees, they may perhaps tend 
to—without conscious thought—
give added weight to a white actor 
or actress, merely because the white 
actor ?ts their expectations of the 
image of an Oscar nominee. Perhaps.
This racial homogeneity is a result 
of years of cultural programming. 
These Academy Award members, 
just like many Americans, may be 
well balanced, open-minded, kind, 
and tolerant. But they may still har-
bor unconscious racial prejudice—
and weren’t even aware of it. Until 
now. 
After a week of intense criticism 
from celebrities and fans alike, the 
Academy “approved a sweeping 
series of substantive changes”—in 
their own words—to diversify their 
membership. By 2020, they intend 
to double the number of female and 
minority votes. They hope that these 
changes will result in non-whites 
composing 14 percent and women 
composing 48 percent of their mem-
bership.
The response to this carefully-de-
signed proclamation has been gener-
ally positive. While some still view 
these changes as inadequate or only 
an act of self-preservation, many ap-
preciate the bold efforts. April Reign, 
the former attorney and managing 
editor of BroadwayBlack.com and 
creator of #OscarsSoWhite, said 
that she is “very encouraged” by the 
changes. She also stressed the need 
“to put pressure on the Hollywood 
studio heads to make more inclusive 
and diverse ?lms, because the acad-
emy can only nominate quality work 
that has been made.”
So while this uniquely glamor-
ous case of subconscious racism has 
received positive actions towards 
its elimination, the environment in 
which it was born still requires more 
forceful changes—changes that can-
not be made by rewriting policy. 
When the origin of such prejudice 
lives in the American subconscious, 
it cannot be altered by only hashtags 
and celebrity boycotts. True change 
will only result from the education of 
this country as a whole, encouraging 
support of minorities’ ?lms and roles 
to pervade society more than this ar-
chaic prejudice already has.
What will it take for non black students 
and administration alike to see how 
ignoring blackness and covert racism 
is in fact condoning it. When will we 
start to see that not caring for our fellow 
peers and classmates is our issue.

on a battle arena called Sum-
moner’s Rift. A team wins by 
destroying the structures in 
the base of the other team, 
but in order to do this, the 
players must destroy the 
players on the other team 
?rst. For League of Legends, 
games are played in orga-
nized leagues around the 
world. North America and 
Europe each have their own 
separate League Champion-
ship Series, or LCS for short, 
in which eight teams com-
pete weekly in a season style 
format, with the standings 
at the end of the season de-
termining who makes it to 
playoffs and eventually the 
world championship. Korea, 
China, and Southeast Asia 
also each have their own 
version of these organized 
leagues that produce a set of 
winners to send to the world 
championship at the end of 
the year. The 2015 League 
of Legends World Champion-
ship was played as a 16 team 
round-robin group stage fol-
lowed by an eight team single 
elimination bracket, and the 
?nals were held in the Mer-
cedes-Benz Arena in Berlin, 
Germany with a prize pool of 
2.3 million dollars. Over 36 
million people, with a peak 
concurrent viewership of 14 
million viewers, watched 
the ?nal round of the world 
championship. With these 
viewership numbers, League 
of Legends has been mak-
ing waves in the ?nancial 
world as well as in the video 
game world, and big name 
sponsors have noticed. Most 
recently, Geico Insurance 
made a sponsorship deal 
with North American esports 
organization Team Solomid, 
just to give an idea of the 
scope these sponsorships. 
Popular TV personality Rick 
Fox also just purchased a 
team to compete in the North 
American LCS. Big names 
are entering the esports in-
dustry, and money is pour-
ing in faster than ever. But 
what does this mean for the 
growth of the industry? It 
means esports will continue 
to grow in popularity, and 
more regulations must be 
put in place in order to pro-
tect the lives of players and 
people involved in organiza-
tions in this new industry. 
The League of Legends com-
munity has grown exponen-
tially since the outset of the 
game in 2009, and it is evi-
dent in both the production 
quality of League of Legends 
broadcasts as well as the 
sheer number of players of 
the game. People that don’t 
play the game are becoming 
aware of the fact that League 
of Legends, and video games 
in general, are becoming a 
part of the realm of specta-
tor sports and their value as 
a source of revenue and as a 
catalyst of community can-
not be understated.
If you’re interested in 
checking out the action for 
yourself, the League Champi-
on Series began the week of 
January 16th, and games are 
played on Thursday, Friday, 
Saturday, and Sunday every 
week, live broadcast on You-
Tube, Twitch.tv, and Azubu. 
The future of spectator sports 
has arrived. The community 
is relentless and the compe-
tition is intense, and esports 
will be around for years to 
come with a passionate com-
munity behind it.
Esports continue to make waves in the world of spectator competition
to the legal system, and U.S. 
District Judge Richard Bren-
nan sided with Brady, forcing 
the NFL to cancel the suspen-
sion. Still, Goodell insisted 
on appealing to the 2nd U.S. 
Circuit Court of Appeals, con-
tinuing to escalate the feud to 
this day. Had Goodell abided 
by the rules of the CBA and 
issued a ?ne on Brady, his 
authority as commissioner 
might have been attacked by 
other owners, but it would 
never have gotten into the 
U.S. court system. With a 
judge’s order to reel in the 
commissioner’s powers, it ap-
pears that there will be unrest 
in the league’s system as the 
balance of power changes. 
What effects this may have on 
football’s future is completely 
unknown.
While the changing bal-
ance of power may lead to 
devastating consequences 
down the line, player safety 
concerns threaten to destroy 
the game more immediately. 
Early on during the last off-
season, four players under 
the age of 30 decided to re-
tire early rather than risk 
developing lasting impair-
ments. San Francisco 49ers 
linebacker Patrick Willis, 
Tennessee Titans quarter-
back Jake Locker, Pittsburgh 
Steelers outside linebacker 
Jason Worilds and Oakland 
Raiders running back Mau-
rice Jones-Drew all decided 
to retire in spite of the money 
on the table. Though the NFL 
has been trying a number of 
measures to try to improve 
player safety, the reality of 
professional football’s dam-
age to the human body could 
end up making the tough na-
ture of football a huge deter-
rent rather than a positive for 
the league.
For the NFL, times are 
good now, and they probably 
will stay good for quite some 
time. However, the ongoing 
challenges that the NFL faces 
must be handled well. Other-
wise, football will relinquish 
its status as the most promi-
nent sport in America, some-
thing that no player, owner, 
or league executive would 
like to see.

Fall Varsity Sports: A season of CMU athletics revisited 
JORDAN SAFER
Staffwriter
Men’s Cross Country 
     Coming into the season 
with new head coach Timothy 
Connelly, the Carnegie Mellon 
men’s cross country team had 
a lot of questions about what 
direction the program would 
take, a year after winning 
NCAA Regionals and placing 
24th at NCAA DIII Nationals.
The team made a statement in 
Connelly’s ?rst year, winning 
the UAA Championships in 
cross country for the ?rst time 
in 10 years on the way to an 
18th place ?nish at nationals, 
a six place improvement from 
the year before. Helped by one 
of the deepest rosters in recent 
history and great perfor-
mances by junior runner Ryan 
Archer, the Tartans established 
themselves as the team to beat 
in the conference.
Football
The Carnegie Mellon foot-
ball team got off to a slow start, 
dropping an important confer-
ence game to Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis on their way 
to a 1–3 record through the ?rst 
four games. The season looked 
to be in trouble, even though 
sophomore running back Sam 
Benger managed over 200 yards 
rushing in two of three losses.
Benger’s statistical contri-
butions didn’t stay out of the 
box score for long, with the 
Tartan men breaking out of 
their slump to win their next 
four games by 21, 44, 28, and 
54 points before entering 
their next UAA contest. There, 
the Carnegie men turned 
heads with a 52–7 lights-out 
performance to take care of 
business with the visiting Uni-
versity of Chicago Maroons.
This paved the way to a con-
ference showdown with rival 
No. 22 ranked Case Western 
Reserve University for the UAA 
Conference title. The Tartans 
carried their momentum into 
the contest, and held on for a 
tight 52–42 result. With a mid-
season turnaround, a strong 
defense, and an unstoppable 
offense the Carnegie men took 
their ?rst conference champi-
onship in 10 years and went on 
to win the ECAC Legacy Bowl 
to put a stamp on the end of 
their season.
Four players were named to 
the D3football.com All-Amer-
ican team, the ?rst Carnegie 
football players to be recog-
nized as such since 2006.
Men’s Soccer
Looking to make a mark 
with a competitive lineup en-
tering the season, the Carn-
egie Mellon men’s soccer team 
came out scoring to open up 
the 2015 season. Going 7–1–1, 
including a 4–3 win over #3 
ranked Messiah in September, 
the Tartan men positioned 
themselves as contenders en-
tering UAA competition.
The Tartans entered their ?-
nal conference matchup against 
Case Western Reserve Uni-
versity with a 3–1–2 record in 
conference play. Through an 
evenly matched and tightly 
contested game, the Spartans 
eventually came away with the 
win off of a late goal in double 
overtime. The Tartans took the 
loss, but still managed a third 
place ?nish in the UAA going 
into the NCAA tournament.
The Tartans’ tournament 
run ended up being a short 
one, as leading scorer and se-
nior mid?elder William Webb 
failed to ?nd the net in a 2–1 
defeat to Gordon College. In 
spite of the loss, the Carnegie 
men’s return to the NCAA tour-
nament and their strong ?nish 
in the UAA conference stand-
ings both bode well for next 
season.
Women’s Cross Country
Debuting under head coach 
Timothy Connelly, the Carn-
egie Mellon women’s cross 
country team had a mix of suc-
cesses that both showed the 
talent and tenacity of the team. 
Coming off of a positive 2014, 
highlighted by 7th place ?nish 
at NCAA Regionals, the Tartan 
women looked to continue to 
improve.
Early on, Carnegie made 
subtle improvements, equaling 
a 4th place ?nish at the Carn-
egie Mellon Invitational from a 
year ago despite an expanded 
?eld. But the Tartans didn’t 
stop there, generating excite-
ment for their great potential 
with a 1st place ?nish out of 
29 teams, including two UAA 
rivals, at the Inter–Regional 
Rumble at Oberlin College the 
following week. Led by senior 
runner Rekha Schnepf, the 
Tartans ?nished 7th at NCAA 
Regionals again this year, but 
showed they have room to im-
prove. The team will be one to 
watch out for next season.
Women’s Soccer
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s soccer team had one of the 
best years in program history, 
dominating through most 
of the season in a potential 
bid for a UAA Championship 
and more. The team followed 
through on their UAA bid, 
?nishing off UAA play with 
a win over Case Western Re-
serve University to leave them 
6–1–0 in conference play, good 
enough for the championship.
The team then entered the 
NCAA tournament as the No. 
5 ranked team in the nation, 
and went on to win games in 
the ?rst two rounds of tourna-
ment play. The Tartans fell in 
the sectional semi?nal to 20th 
ranked Calvin College, losing 
in overtime in spite of a strong 
offensive and defensive combi-
nation through out the game.
With a lot of success and 
something left the strive for, 
the Carnegie women can look 
back on their accomplish-
ments with pride while look-
ing forward to a chance to do 
even more next year.
 Women’s Volleyball
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s volleyball team opened up 
their season with a winning 
clinic, taking care of business 
on 24 of their ?rst 25 sets, 
while winning 11 straight 
games. Extending their suc-
cess going into the UAA tour-
nament, they went 4–3 in con-
ference play, backed by strong 
play from senior libero Molly 
Higgins and junior setter Emily 
Newton.
Despite of their positive 
record all season, the Tartan 
women found themselves 
disappointed early in the UAA 
tournament, with a ?rst round 
loss to University of Chicago 
ending their bid for a confer-
ence title. The team ?nished 
the tournament with a couple 
wins in order to secure a 5th 
place UAA ?nish, before con-
tinuing to ECAC South tourna-
ment play.
In the ECAC South Tourna-
ment, Carnegie built off two 
wins to advance to the ?nal, 
and ?nished as the runner–up 
in the region to Swarthmore 
College. With a 29–8 ?nish to 
the season, and a runner–up 
?nish in the ECAC south tour-
nament, the Tartans managed 
a successful result through 
tough competition.
SPORTS BRIEFS

ninth double-double of the 
season. The Tartans shot 33.8 
percent from the ?oor.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
squared off in a tight match-
up against the University of 
Rochester. The battle was 
tight to the very end. First-
year forward and center Pat-
rick Ehland managed to get 
an offensive rebound as time 
ran down on the Tartans’ last 
hopes for a win, but a three 
point attempt by senior guard 
Jason Sebak fell short of the 
mark, ending the game in a 
66–63 loss for the Tartans.

Tartans fell to 7–9 overall and 
0–5 in the UAA. The Tartans 
will look to rebound against 
New York University on 
Friday, Jan. 29.
Women’s Basketball
On Friday, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s basketball 
team ranked 20th in the 
nation by D3hoops.com took 
on Emory University, falling 
by 63–52.
Junior guard Jackie Hude-
pohl made the ?rst three shots 
for the Tartans, helping them 
jump to an early 8–5 lead. The 
Tartans managed to keep it 
close with the Eagles, but a 
missed opportunity to tie the 
game 52–52 allowed Emory 
to seal the game away. Junior 
center and forward Liza Mur-
phy was the driving force of 
the team, scoring 23 points 
and making 15 rebounds.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
faced off against the seventh 
ranked University of Roches-
ter, falling 75–52. Rochester’s 
defense kept the Tartans to a 
season-low 31.5% shooting 
from the ?oor. Hudepohl led 
the Tartans with 13 points 
while Murphy scored a sea-
son-low 12 points.
The Tartans fell to 13–3 
overall and 2–3 in the UAA. 
The Tartans will next face 
New York University on Fri-
day, Jan. 29.

Spring varsity sports preview: Looking forward to 2016

Men’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
golf team is looking to build off 
of steady improvement in the 
fall going into championship 
season. The Tartan men worked 
their way from a 14th place ?n-
ish out of 18 teams at the Flower 
City Preview in September to a 
1st place ?nish out of six teams 
at the Carnegie Mellon Fall In-
vitational to close out the fall 
season.
Paced by sophomore Nikhil 
Mohan and ever consistent 
?rst-year Austin Lin, who has 
recorded scores between 75 
and 79 in all of his rounds, the 
team is poised to outperform 
its UAA Championship perfor-
mance from a year ago. Last time 
around, only two players record-
ed scores under 80. This year, 
the men have a good at chance 
at getting four scores under the 
mark.
With the UAA Championships 
set for the weekend of March 
12th, Carnegie will look to im-
prove on last year’s second place 
?nish.
Men’s Basketball
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team has had a slow 
start to their season. Currently 
7–9 (0–5 in the UAA), the team 
has struggled in conference 
competition. Last year, the team 
faced similar struggles early on, 
winning only one conference 
game in January, before going 
4–5 in the conference in Febru-
ary, upsetting 12th ranked Wash-
ington University in St. Louis.
Junior forward Jack Serbin 
will be a key to any Tartan turn-
around, playing as an offensive 
and defensive centerpiece for 
the team through their ?rst 15 
games. Current Eastern Col-
legiate Athletic Conference 
(ECAC) South Player of the 
Week Serbin has led the team 
in scoring and rebounding, with 
19.3 points per game and 10.7 
rebounds per game.
The group has bene?ted from 
the contributions of ?rst-year 
center Patrick Ehland, a young 
spark for the team with a team–
leading ?eld goal percentage of 
56.4 percent. With more UAA 
contests coming up to determine 
the ?nal conference standings, 
the team will take advantage of 
contributions from throughout 
the roster as they try to turn 
things around.
Men’s Swimming & Diving
With continuing dominance 
in duals a foregone conclu-
sion (9–0), the Carnegie Mel-
lon men’s swimming and diving 
team is working to build momen-
tum going into the UAA Cham-
pionships in February. There is 
room for improvement at confer-
ences, with last year’s 5th place 
?nish serving as a reminder of 
the ?erce competition the team 
will face from other parts of the 
UAA.
The Tartan men look to have 
a very bright future, with a dom-
inant young roster. The swim-
mers are led by freshmen sprint 
specialist Jack Dangremond and 
freestyle and butter?y specialist 
Mitchell Riek. The two fresh-
men combine to lead the team 
in seven events, ?ve of which are 
led by Riek. On the diving side of 
the team, ?rst-year diver Gabriel 
Bamforth provides an injection 
of talent to the dive team, lead-
ing the men in scoring in every 
dive event. With a very young 
and talented group powering the 
roster, the team will look to turn 
heads at UAAs.
Men’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
tennis team will look to improve 
on a strong performance from 
last year, with continued domi-
nance by senior singles player 
Abhishek Alla and growing 
depth brought by the freshmen 
class. Alla showcased his bene?t 
to the team with a win at the ITA 
Southeast Regional, beating 64 
other contestants in a dominant 
fashion.
The team also showed off its 
depth at the same event, with 
a semi–?nal appearance by 
?rst-year singles player Daniel 
Levine, who was eliminated by 
Alla. The ?rst big test for the 
squad will come in a dual meet 
against Duquesne University 
at the end of the month. This 
is where the group got handed 
their ?rst loss of the season last 
year.
The Tartans will then go on 
to test themselves at the ITA Na-
tional team indoor champion-
ships on February 19th.
Men’s Track & Field
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
track and ?eld team has gotten 
off to a strong start this season, 
and will look to translate their 
successes into victories in a dual 
meet with Case Western and at 
the UAA Indoor and Outdoor 
Championships later on in the 
season.
At the indoor champion-
ships, the Tartans will look to 
replace the contributions of last 
year’s 5000–meter UAA cham-
pion George Degen by turning 
to other contributors on a deep 
squad. Passionate ?rst-year long 
jumper Rai Walters earned ECAC 
Rookie of the Week honors in his 
?rst collegiate competition with 
a jump of 6.80 meters, demon-
strating the young talent on the 
men’s squad.
The team will look for a 
strong UAA performance on Feb-
ruary 27th at New York Univer-
sity (NYU).
Women’s Golf
In their second year as a 
varsity team, the Carnegie Mel-
lon women’s golf team looks to 
improve on their breakout ?rst 
year as a program. A strong 
core of sophomores spearheads 
the team, which demonstrates 
strong potential to improve their 
standing within the UAA and 
nationally.
With four starting players 
having recorded rounds under 
85, the team has the talent to 
compete at big meets, but needs 
to establish consistency. Howev-
er, since they are currently out-
side of a conference with an au-
tomatic quali?er for nationals, it 
will be a challenge to rise to the 
top level this year.
Women’s Basketball
Looking unstoppable in the 
early goings of the season, the 
No. 21 ranked Carnegie Mel-
lon women’s basketball team 
has rolled to a 13–2 (2–3 in the 
UAA) record. With a mix of high-
scoring beat downs on weaker 
opponents (the Tartan women 
currently average 77.7 points per 
game) and challenging show-
downs with other highly ranked 
UAA opponents, the season looks 
to be a big one for the Tartans.
Junior center and forward 
Lisa Murphy has played con-
sistently at very high level for 
the Tartan women, averaging a 
nation leading 26.1 points per 
game. Murphy’s ?eld goal per-
centage of 78.0% also leads the 
nation, and leaves little doubt 
about why the women have 
proved to be so successful. Mur-
phy has already collected 5 UAA 
Player of the Week awards this 
season.
The Tartan women will look 
to ride Murphy’s success to ad-
ditional victories in UAA play 
through February. Matchups 
against No. 6 Washington Uni-
versity in St. Louis and No. 8 
NYU loom large on the schedule. 
These games look to play a big 
factor in the team’s late season 
outcomes.
Women’s Swimming & Diving
Rolling at 9–0 with aspiration 
for the UAA championships and 
the NCAA DIII Championships, 
the Carnegie Mellon women’s 
swimming and diving team has 
looked strong and balanced ear-
ly.
A diverse group of athletes 
of all ages provides a balanced 
backing to the Tartan team. Ju-
nior freestyle specialist Allison 
Kirkby will take charge in the 
sprint events, as she leads the 
team in the 50, 100, and 200 
meter freestyle. Sophomore In-
dividual Medley and butter?y 
specialist Mary St. John will help 
out a deep group of swimmers 
in the longer events, excelling 
at the 400 IM. And senior diver 
Winona Li will provide support 
from the dive team, leading the 
group in both the 1 and 3 meter 
dives off of six attempts.
With contributions from a 
large group, the group will look 
to make their depth count late in 
the season.
Women’s Tennis
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis team will look to 
translate a good showing in the 
fall into a continuation of their 
success in championship season 
this year. Coming off a 2nd place 
UAA ?nish last year, and an All 
American selection for junior 
singles player Vanessa Pavia, the 
team will work to improve its 
UAA standing this time round.
Senior singles player Brooke 
Tsu was a source of the Carnegie 
women’s fall success, ?nishing as 
runner up in the ITA Southeast 
Regional in October.
The team will resume play 
for the year in earlier February, 
with home opponents including 
a tough matchup with Duquesne 
University on February 13th.
Women’s Track and Field
Coming off a strong perfor-
mance at the Al Hall Freedom 
Games, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s track and ?eld team 
will try to continue the success 
through the UAA Indoor Cham-
pionships, and the UAA Out-
door Championships later in the 
season. The Tartan women will 
look to have a big year, by re-
loading their squad after the loss 
of seniors Sasha Spalding and 
Erin Kiekhaefer from last year’s 
squad.
Freshman high jumper Tessa 
Allen started off her opening 
season with an impressive per-
formance, jumping 1.60 meters, 
which tied her for 2nd all time in 
the history of the women’s pro-
gram.
The Tartans’ ?rst big test will 
be against Case Western Reserve 
University on January 30th, 
where they will look to recover 
from a loss last year.
Balance of power shifting in NFL as a result of scandal
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
On Feb. 7, 2015, Super 
Bowl 50 will shape up to be 
the biggest entertainment 
event in history, at least un-
til the next year’s game. Well 
over 100 million Americans 
will watch the game and the 
halftime show, and millions 
more will be watching all over 
the world. It’s safe to say that 
football has been the domi-
nant sport in the American 
market for quite some time, 
and that title carries a huge 
payday to the National Foot-
ball League (NFL).
The Dallas Cowboys, New 
England Patriots, Washing-
ton Redskins, New York Gi-
ants, and Houston Texans 
are all worth over $1 billion 
each and are the most highly 
valued teams in the NFL. At 
the bottom of the barrel, the 
St. Louis Rams’ value of $930 
million stands as a testament 
to the amount of money in 
football. Player salaries have 
risen considerably since the 
latest collective bargaining 
agreement (CBA) put an end 
to the $70 million contracts 
that top rookie prospects com-
manded. The top-tier quarter-
backs in the league now com-
mand $100 million contracts 
easily, with Green Bay Pack-
ers quarterback Aaron Rodg-
ers making $22 million last 
year alone. Head coaches top 
out with $8 million for Seattle 
Seahawks coach Pete Carroll 
and New Orleans Saints coach 
Sean Payton while the bottom 
?ve head coaches took $3.5 
million each.
Despite the ?nancial boom 
in football that shows no sign 
of slowing down barring a 
huge recession, the NFL con-
tinues to face big challenges to 
its status as the premier sports 
league in the United States. 
The integrity of the league 
itself has undergone intense 
scrutiny due to its handling of 
the De?ategate scandal from 
the 2014 AFC Championship 
Game. Commissioner of the 
NFL Roger Goodell was reso-
lute on issuing a strict punish-
ment on the Patriots as other 
owners put the pressure on 
him to act stronger than he 
did in 2007 Spygate scandal. 
Although Patriots owner Rob-
ert Kraft accepted the league 
stripping the Patriots of two 
draft picks and ?ning the 
team $1 million, he was furi-
ous when Goodell decided to 
suspend Patriots quarterback 
Tom Brady for four games.
The basis for the suspen-
sion was a report conducted 
by a ?rm called Exponent, 
whose ?ndings were cited by 
the Wells Report and consid-
ered proof that the Patriots 
had intentionally brought un-
derin?ated footballs to cheat. 
Outside the NFL, many scien-
tists disagreed, reaching con-
clusion that the de?ated balls 
in the game were consistent 
with the Ideal Gas Law. Carn-
egie Mellon physics profes-
sor Gregg Franklin explained 
away the issue in a January 
2015 press release. “It’s pretty 
simple physics,” Franklin said. 
“If you pump up a bicycle tire 
using air from a warm room 
and then take it outside on 
a cold winter day, you’ll ?nd 
that the pressure in the tire 
decreases as the air in the tire 
cools off. The air pressure in 
a football is no different. If a 
football is in?ated to the mini-
mum pressure allowed by the 
NFL—12.5 pounds per square 
inch—using warm air, the 
football’s pressure will drop 
below this minimum value as 
the air cools.”
Goodell’s insistence on 
being both the deliverer of 
Brady’s suspension and the 
only one the quarterback 
could appeal to drew much 
ire. Brady and the NFL Players 
Association (NFLPA) argued 
that Goodell was overstep-
ping the bounds of the CBA.

A packed stadium shakes 
with noise and anticipation. 
Thousands sit at the edge of 
their seats, waiting anxiously 
for the competition to start. 
But what competition are 
they here to see? Could it be 
a hockey game, or perhaps 
football? It might seem that 
way at ?rst glance, but instead 
this ?lled stadium is ready 
to watch people play video 
games. This phenomenon has 
increased in popularity and 
frequency over the past de-
cade, and it’s called esports. 
Competitions are live broad-
cast, with a production team 
of commentators and often-
large prize pools on top of 
the salaries that players earn, 
and millions of people tune in 
from their computers around 
the world to watch the com-
petitions for themselves. 
There are many different 
video games that people play 
and watch in the world of es-
ports, most notably League of 
Legends, Dota 2, and Coun-
ter Strike: Global Offensive. 
The most popular and rapidly 
growing community is that of 
League of Legends. This game 
is a multiplayer online battle 
arena, or MOBA for short, 
where players are organized 
into two teams of ?ve, and 
then each player picks a char-
acter to control. The players 
then use their 5 characters to 
team up and work to defeat 
the other ?ve-player team 
  
 Despite the 
?nancial boom 
in football that 
shows no sign 
of slowing 
down, the 
NFL continues 
to face big 
challenges to 
its status as the 
premier sports 
league in the 
United States.

Things to do on a snowy day
Don’t let the cold and dreary days get you down. 
The past couple of days have alternated between 
frigid and mildly cold, with the most of us content 
to live distraction-free—going from home to class 
and back. The outdoors are widely regarded as 
too hostile to be host to any revelry. Well, it really 
doesn’t have to be that way. The indoors? Well, 
you’re gonna be stuck inside, might as well make 
it entertaining. Here are five really cool (pun 
intended) things that you can do on a snowy day!
Outdoors:
The classics: Make a snowman. Or a snow woman. 
Or a snow angel. Or a castle or a monster! There’s 
something to be said for the soft fluffiness and 
pristine whiteness covering everything on a snowy 
day that brings out childlike creativity in everyone 
if they just let it. Snow artifacts are fun for kids, 
adults, and everyone in between. If you’ve got 
a sizable group, you can even have a contest of 
creativity. Igloos are a particular challenge. If you 
have a large quantity of tupperware lying around, 
this is a perfect idea. If you are feeling a little more 
creative, try making a giant teacup or a snow 
couch. Somewhere that you and your friends can 
lounge while enjoying the outside world among the 
swirling and sparkly snow.
Ice skating: Pittsburgh happens to have some 
really nice skating rinks. The thing is, being 
outdoors, most of them are highly temperamental, 
and thus closed for the majority of the year, and 
even large parts of winter. Take advantage of a time 
when they’d most definitely be open and check 
them out! PPG place downtown has a beautiful 
rink with lots of great places to eat around. The 
Schenley Skating Rink is closer to campus and 
slightly bigger - but seems to be in the middle of 
nowhere. Going ice skating is a really great date 
idea. If you are awful at ice skating, adorable hand 
holding in mittens is a good option. Snuggling 
to get warm also lends itself to an adorable date 
factor. That being said, giggling with friends and 
falling down in big piles is an equally satisfying use 
of an afternoon and cold temperatures. Check out 
CBS’ list of best ice skating rinks in Pittsburgh to 
figure out new ad exciting places to get your ice 
skating on.
Go to an afternoon indie movie: Get some of that 
indie cred. Most cinemas offer discounted rates 
on cold and dreary days. Pull up Rotten Tomatoes, 
look up something interesting, and go check it out! 
Especially seeing as it is Oscar season, there’s a ton 
of really thought provoking small movies currently 
playing. Some of my recommendations— The 
Revenant, The Big Short and The Hateful Eight.
Indoors:
Board games: Could there be a better excuse to 
pull out that old dust-covered Monopoly or Risk 
game that you have? Get some friends and family 
together, and collectively obsess over fake money 
and territory! People will laugh, argue, and yell; 
someone will probably try to cheat too. Even if 
some of your crazier friends throw tantrums or 
board pieces, everyone will be closer by the end of 
it.
Bake something: Nothing, literally nothing, can 
beat the smell of freshly baked cookies or a fresh 
apple pie on a cold and wintry day. Even if you 
don’t cook much, don’t let the prospect scare you 
away. Making standard stuff like cookies is easy! 
Just don’t get distracted by other snowy day things 
to do while your cookies are in the oven. When 
they’re ready, pull out that bottle of red wine you’ve 
been saving, call some friends over, and have a 
small junk food party.

Advice for awkward people
Howdy Josh,
I’m in a bit of a pickle. 
This semester, my 
classes are super duper 
dif?cult, like much harder 
than they were last year, 
and I’ve developed a 
pretty bad habit recently. 
I’m not doing well in any 
of my classes, and I feel 
very unful?lled most of 
the time. Every morning, 
I’m overcome by this 
crazy dread, and I just 
really don’t want to get 
out of bed. The cold 
doesn’t help either, since 
my apartment doesn’t 
have dependable heat, 
but that’s another story 
for another time. 
The only way I can pull 
myself out of bed is to 
think about all of the ice 
cream in my fridge. Every 
day, before I even work 
through my morning 
routine, I sit in bed and 
mentally prepare for the 
coming day by downing 
an entire pint of Ben 
& Jerry’s, and I’m not 
talking the simple ?avors, 
either. I’m talking Phish 
Food and Chubby Hubby 
and Half-Baked, man. 
Then, when I brush my 
teeth, I just look at all 
of the chocolate chunks 
and caramel swirls I’m 
scrubbing off my teeth, 
and I just feel really sick. 
This has been a daily 
occurrence for the past 
two weeks, and it’s really 
putting me in a bad frame 
of mind for the rest of the 
day — and I know that it’s 
not healthy to have this 
much dairy in one’s diet. 
What should I do?
Thanks in advance,
Helplessly Aroused by 
Zesty English Delicacies
Dear HAZED (and 
confused),
I’m sorry you’re in such 
a cycle! The thing about 
emotional attachments to 
food is that most, if not all, 
people have them. Yours, 
it seems, is brought on by 
stress and has roots in the 
need for reward-y feelings. 
Since you don’t seem to 
be getting those feelings 
from your class work, I 
think that you’re trying to 
find it somewhere else, 
and the easiest thing to 
do is grab a pint and start 
eating. I also think that the 
time frame, in particular, is 
interesting. The morning 
is a struggle for a lot of 
people — especially if 
you have morning classes 
which you aren’t quite 
psyched to attend.
The good thing here is that 
you’re still getting up and 
doing what you need to 
do, but moving forward, 
I think that the solution 
is to find another reason 
to get up, or something 
else that makes you really 
want to seize the day. 
Ideally, that wouldn’t be 
something tangible, it’d 
be some kind of swanky 
internal motivation, but if 
you want to slowly wean 
yourself from the ice cream, 
you could find an actual 
bit of breakfast food that 
you’re excited to have — 
something comfortable 
and warm and maybe even 
healthy. When it comes 
down to it, though, it’s all 
about your own reasons for 
wanting to get out of bed, 
and your own motivation 
for seizing the day.
Peace, love, and puppy-
dog tails, 
Josh
Ice cream mornings and general procrastination

4opera
pillbox 01.25.16
“Hydrogen Jukebox,” a 1990 musical collaboration 
between Philip Glass and Allen Ginsberg and the 
latest operatic production from the School of Music, 
is a very fitting title for the collaboration between two 
titans of American 20th century culture: a fusion of 
thought and music in a single atomically explosive 
package.
On one side of the collaboration we have composer 
Philip Glass, one of the pioneers of minimalist music, 
best known for his breakthrough piece Einstein on 
the Beach. On the other side we have Allen Ginsberg, 
a poet of the Beat Generation, best known for the 
1956 poem “Howl Part II,” a critique of American 
post-war capitalist culture and sexual repression. A 
chance meeting between the two in a New York book 
store in 1988 led to “Hydrogen Jukebox,” an opera 
intended to form a portrait of America in the years 
between 1950 and 1980.
The opera has no narrative structure, but is more of 
a compilation of different pieces. The show starts 
off with low bass notes emulating ominous rumbles 
of thunder and flashes of light to mimic the blue 
lightning mentioned in the first song “Iron Horse,” a 
reflection on the Vietnam War and the state of war in 
America.
The School of Music’s production features a 
minimalist, industrial stage. There is a wall of ridged 
metal in the background, and a giant billboard in 
the foreground that displays the lyrics being sung. 
The billboard at times also shows visual annotations 
of some of the content in the lyrics, which is quite 
helpful in instances where the poems make period-
specific references.
Different props are also introduced and taken off 
stage for each different piece. While most of the time 
these props are innocuous, sometimes they can be 
ridiculous. For instance, during “Iron Horse” a giant 
grenade floats down from ceiling in a not-so-subtle 
allusion to war. During a song about atomic warfare 
where one of the lines is “there were people starving 
and crawling…” a giant hamburger appears on the 
left side of the stage and a shirtless man slowly 
crawls on the ground towards it.
While Ginsberg is mostly known for his highly 
political, Beatnik-era critiques of American society, 
many poems featured in Hydrogen Jukebox also let us 
see more of Ginsberg’s more intimate and reflective 
sides. These pieces greatly help to break up some of 
the more politically heavy pieces, whose enjoyment 
may vary depending on someone’s political beliefs or 
how much knowledge they have of the time era.
“Consulting — Ching” is a contemplative song about 
the passing of time while slowly getting high on pot 
and drifting off to “the deserted city which lies below 
consciousness.” “Cabin in the Woods” is a haiku-like 
composition about watching the sun rise with a cup 
of tea while sitting on a tree stump in the mountains 
that Glass transforms into an ethereal aria. In “to 
P.O.” Ginsberg describes a hot summer night in 
Calcutta with his lover. The warm yellow lighting and 
the staging, a single bare yellow light bulb hanging 
above a rocking chair, seems to transport one into 
the hot hotel room where Ginsberg was staying. The 
music, tinged with the soft rattle of maracas and the 
ringing of Indian bells, has a mesmerizing, ritualistic 
feel. “From The Green Automobile” is an imagined 
road trip with an old friend; the musical composition 
is bright and free — woodwinds and electric tones 
resonate with the child-like excitement and wistful 
imagination of the poem. A projection of hand-
drawn stars appears during the verse with “forestlike 
unnatural radiance illuminating the mountaintop.”
The highlight of the show, however, is “Wichita 
Vortex Sutra,” a poem that reconciles Ginsberg’s 
political and personal sides. The poem, first 
composed by Ginsberg on a tape recording made 
while traveling to Kansas on a bus, is a call for healing 
after the brutality of the Vietnam War. Glass’s warm 
yet minimal piano accompaniment flows fluidly 
alongside with Ginsberg’s poetry and subtly but 
powerfully emphasizes its emotional undertones. 
Junior Linguistics major Dante Horvath does an 
excellent, impassioned reading of the Ginsberg poem.
“Wichita Vortex Sutra,” which is performed spoken, 
does leaves one questioning why Glass decided to 
convert Ginsberg’s free verse poetry into, of all forms, 
opera. Much of the poetry’s original musicality in 
terms of the rhythm of the syllables in each verse is 
lost in the transition into operatic song. Verses are 
often stretched out or condensed at places where 
they normally would not be if spoken. A prime 
example of this is in “To Aunt Rose” where the verse 
“limping down the long hall in Newark on the running 
carpet” becomes “limmping down the long halllllllll – 
in Newwwwwark – on the ruuuuunning caaaaaarpet” 
when sung.
That is not to say all of the pieces don’t work with 
the format. Some poems, especially those with a 
more lyrical or hymn-like structure to begin with, 
work surprisingly well. For instance, “Howl Part II,” 
a condemnation of war and capitalism, features a 
screeching, howling sax line while harsh neon pink 
and red lights frame the singers. Altogether, it sounds 
like Satanic hymn. Similarily, the closing piece 
“Father Death Blues,” a poem about accepting death 
whose structure was also originally more lyrical, uses 
a wide range of voices to create a contemplative 
lullaby.
For those interested in the works of Glass or 
Ginsberg, “Hydrogen Jukebox” is a good introduction 
to both their styles and composition. Even for those 
uninterested in either artist, their collaboration on 
“Wichita Vortex Sutra” is an experience that must be 
heard; it is truly a merging of their work, a piece that 
brings together the best aspects of both artists.

Go to Phipps for respite from winter cold
Orchid and Tropical Bonsai Show opens just in time to offer shelter to ?ower-loving visitors
Snowmageddon is ?nally here: the strange and 
unseasonably warm and sunny weather ?nally gave way to 
the menacing cold. As winter continues to cover campus 
in a sheet of ice, and Mother Nature whirls ?urries of snow 
through the air and into our faces, it’s hard to remember 
the colors and aromas of a blossoming springtime. But trust 
me, not all hope is lost! Phipps Conservatory and Botanical 
Garden’s most recent exhibit, the Orchid and Tropical 
Bonsai Show, promises sights and smells from a warm, 
tropical destination.
Phipps Conservatory and Botanical Garden is home to a 
large assortment of permanent plant and ?ower gardens, 
as well as interchanging seasonal exhibits from a variety 
of artists and curators. Current seasonal exhibits include 
Tropical Forest Congo, Garden Railroad, and an outdoor 
Friday Nights of Winter Lights display.
Just in time to cure the winter blues, the Conservatory 
reopened its permanent Bonsai exhibits with the addition of 
various types of orchids to create The Orchid and Tropical 
Bonsai Show. This exhibit, designed by the Phipps staff, has 
been previously displayed, and never fails to draw a crowd. 
The bonsai are one of the Conservatory’s most famous 
displays, and the orchids are a staff favorite.
The ?rst part of the exhibit is the large bonsai display. The 
tropical bonsai on display at Phipps are smaller versions of 
their larger, naturally occuring cousins. The trees may be 
smaller, but are no less beautiful and impressive. Some of 
the tropical bonsai on display include traditional Japanese 
Mock-Oranges, as well as more rare Elephant Trees. 
Originally from Japan, the bonsai tree (which in Japanese 
means “tray planting”) has served as a longtime inspiration 
and art form, one captured beautifully in the exhibit. Artists 
from all over the world “train” bonsai to form into different 
shapes and designs. Information about the types of bonsai, 
as well as how they are trained to take on different shapes, 
can be found on plaques around the display. Ranging 
from tall, slim, and sharply slanted to short, swirled, and 
whimsical, the exhibit offers a wide array of shapes of 
trained bonsai.
As you walk further through the exhibit, the rooms 
exclusively full of bonsai lead the way toward several 
transitional areas where the bonsai and orchids intermingle 
in displays of beautiful contrast. Baskets full of orchids 
hang above displays of bonsai trees, drawing guests’ eyes 
up toward the ceilings, where more orchids are hung and 
intricately displayed. The juxtaposition of the two distinct 
plants is striking.
Walking further still, you come to areas exclusively ?lled with 
delicate orchids, which stand out beautifully against the 
minimalist backdrop of the strong bonsai and glass walls. 
Baskets of orchids ?ll the various walkways and glasshouses 
with color and fragrance.
Phipps presents the orchids as “the ?ower like no other,” and 
after seeing the exhibit, I ?nd it dif?cult to disagree. There 
are thousands of orchid varieties around the world, and the 
exhibit is packed full of some of the best varieties available 
to the curators. The exhibit features over a hundred different 
varieties of orchids, ranging vastly in color, scent, and 
presentation. The largest section of the orchid display is the 
Barbara Tisherman Slipper Orchid collection, a carefully-
crafted display hosted with the conservatory in conjunction 
with the Orchid Society of Western Pennsylvania.
One of the greatest parts about the Orchid and Tropic 
Bonsai Show is its large appeal to various types of guests. 
The exhibit commands the appreciation of all of its guests, 
whether they are bonsai enthusiasts with great eyes for 
beautiful detail, orchid a?cionados with a gratitude for the 
professional curating, or college students just interested in a 
peaceful evening admiring what seem like a billion ?owers.
Though many may not be willing to make the trek 
through the snow over to Phipps’ Conservatory, I do highly 
recommend making the journey. Step out of the icy cold and 
into the tranquility and serenity of The Orchid and Tropic 
Bonsai Show. The exhibit is on display every day from now 
until Sunday, Feb. 28.

David Bowie was a revolutionary musician. He lived a 
very controversial life, right from his coming out as gay 
with the emergence of his alter ego Ziggy Stardust to later 
calling his coming out the biggest mistake he ever made. 
However, one thing remained true: his musical talent far 
surpasses any controversy surrounding his sexuality. From 
Hunky Dory to Heroes, David Bowie has a very diverse 
discography.
His debut album, David Bowie, was released in 1967. 
However it wasn’t until the 1969 release of Space Oddity 
that his music began to achieve commercial success. His 
follow-up album Hunky Dory was not as successful at the 
time, but it featured probably one of his most successful 
songs, “Changes.” This album also featured songs such 
as “Andy Warhol” and “Song for Bob Dylan,” which honor 
some of Bowie’s in?uences.
In 1972, David Bowie emerged as Ziggy Stardust, a 
?amboyant character with pale skin and red hair. He 
launched a stage show with the Spiders from Mars. The 
stage show was immediately successful and launched 
Bowie into the spotlight. He began touring the United 
Kingdom, until the show eventually came to the United 
States. If there was ever an artist to de?ne the British punk 
movement, it was David Bowie. He was unafraid to wear 
or say just about anything and Ziggy Stardust de?nitely 
showed this through his extravagant costumes.
David Bowie was also very much a product of his 
environment in the 70s. He reveled in the sex, drugs, and 
rock ‘n’ roll lifestyle that seemed to follow musicians of that 
era around. After coming out in 1972, he later said in 1983 
that he was straight and that his interest in homosexuality 
was a reaction to the situation he was in as Ziggy Stardust. 
There were even rumors of a possible relationship between 
him and Mick Jagger — which aren’t hard to believe if 
you’ve ever seen their “Dancing in the Street” music video. 
Bowie also had a colorful history with politics and even 
claimed to support fascism and showed admiration for 
Adolf Hitler at one point in his life. He later chalked this 
up to drug abuse. He also struggled to ?nd acceptance 
through religion and was turned away from Buddhism and 
told to follow music. Following his marriage to model Iman 
(formally Iman Mohamed Abdulmajid), he claimed to have 
a reignited relationship with God. His religious stance 
however was never clear as he tossed back and forth 
between atheism and believing in God.
The most notable thing that David Bowie did in his career 
was pioneer glam rock. His appearance was almost as 
important as his music. He was the link between punk rock 
and pop. With such a vast discography and wide range 
of different yet unique musical stylings, Bowie was one 
of the most important pop culture references of his time. 
He was heavily in?uenced by art and it clearly showed in 
his music. His sound was very experimental and pushed 
the boundaries of what was considered rock ‘n’ roll at the 
time. He also pushed the boundaries of pop music with his 
new wave sound. It’s hard to classify Bowie’s music as just 
belonging to one genre because he did both pop and punk 
so well.
In addition to making music, Bowie also had quite the 
extensive ?lm career; he even received a Saturn Award 
for Best Actor for his role as Thomas Jerome Newton 
in The Man Who Fell to Earth. There have been several 
documentaries made about him over the course of his 
lifetime because of the interesting life he led. Everyone 
wanted to know more about David Bowie: from his days as 
Ziggy Stardust to his experimental sound, he always found 
a way to keep audiences intrigued.
David Bowie passed away on Jan. 10, 2016 at the age of 69 
from liver cancer. He had not made his battle with cancer 
known to the public at the time. This came two days after 
the release of his album Blackstar and at the the tail end 
of his tenure in Lazarus, a Broadway musical. There might 
never be another star that does what he was able to do for 
not only punk rock and pop, but all pop culture in general. 
After over ?fty years in the music industry, he became a 
cultural icon that has left behind fans spanning several 
generations.

Some celebrity deaths hit you harder than others. 
The ?rst Thursday of classes, the news of actor Alan 
Rickman’s death hit me harder than I was expecting, 
especially following only four days after musician and 
cultural icon David Bowie’s death on January 10. Both of 
these artists were pillars of my youth and childhood; their 
deaths came unexpectedly and the cold weather always 
sets a rather blue and unhappy tone for the days going 
by.
If there is anything that deaths like this teach the rest 
of the world, it’s that underneath the frenzy of the Harry 
Potter franchise or avant garde artistry, these artists 
— and others like them — lived private lives, just like 
regular people. Deaths like this bring to the forefront 
the idea that in this day and age, the media allows us to 
know a true artist, that their lives are public fodder, and 
then turns it on its head. While the world mourns the loss 
of these talented individuals who were in the cultural 
landscape for so long, it’s important to recognize the 
extent to which art and person are one and the same, as 
well as the key distinctions between the two.
Alan Rickman, known perhaps best by millennials as 
Professor Severus Snape in the ?lm adaptations of J.K. 
Rowling’s Harry Potter series, passed away at the age of 
69 from cancer. His voice, which can only be described 
as melli?uous, is the kind that you want love letters to 
be read in. Even in some of his other performances, such 
as in Die Hard, Sense and Sensibility, or Love Actually, 
I picture him weeping and clutching the lifeless body 
of Lily Potter during the emotional memory montage of 
Snape in the ?nal Harry Potter ?lm.
Bowie, conversely, wore so many hats that it is hard to 
picture him in one era or one musical genre. In a cruel 
coincidence, Bowie passed away at the same age and 
from the same cause as Rickman. But while Rickman’s 
most notable and enduring feature is his voice, Bowie 
is perhaps most notable for not really having any single 
voice. As a result, Bowie is indelibly etched into my 
memory as Ziggy Stardust, his alter ego for a while. But 
Bowie’s career spanned beyond that in either direction. 
In fact, his most recent album, Blackstar, was released 
just two days before his death.
While these two men seemed to have little intersection, 
except for an interesting collision on an episode of The 
Simpsons years ago, their deaths, and the coincidence 
of them happening almost in conjunction, led to an 
enormous social media response. For all the Facebook 
statuses that pledge sorrow and sympathy toward the 
individuals and their families, there is the response of 
those close to the deceased describing more of their 
lives and their true nature. Many musicians paid tribute 
to Bowie through performances, however many of 
Rickman’s colleagues expressed their sorrow through 
stories of working with him and knowing him. Longtime 
collaborator actress Emma Thompson and Harry Potter 
star Daniel Radcliffe were among those who expressed 
their thoughts about working with Rickman: about his 
compassion, unwavering support, and humor, among 
other characteristics.
While it is great that the lives of these stars impacted so 
many — that is, in fact, the goal of art — it is important 
to respect that being impacted by their art is not the 
same as being impacted by their lives as individuals, 
nor should we treat it as such. In an era where media, 
social and otherwise, give people the impression that 
they can truly know someone, it is important to recognize 
that there are limits to art, and limits to the personal 
connections that can be made through it. The idea of 
this personal connection encourages people to emulate 
others in a positive way at best, and convinces those 
that they have the liberty and obligation to criticize 
and demean others at worst. From behind the veneer of 
anonymity, lashing out against anyone, not just artists, 
out of the illusion of personal connection is damaging 
and incredibly hurtful.
Now more than ever, as we mourn the loss of these great 
people and their art, we need to remember the limit 
of human understanding, and the hurt that feelings of 
closeness can cause. The world is so privileged by what 
they shared and who they were, regardless of whether or 
not everyone truly knew them.

The 88th Academy Awards, to be broadcast on Feb. 28 at 
7:00 p.m. EST from the Dolby Theater in Hollywood, CA, 
has been shined with a dim light in recent weeks since The 
Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences announced 
their nominees. Opinions have been ?ying and, though all 
are valid, have distracted from the Award’s true purpose: the 
celebration of ?lm. The story on every headline regards an 
important and immediate problem that has to be solved, but 
I’d like to take a step back from it for a moment and look at 
this year’s Best Picture nominees. This section will strive to 
?nd the light in the darkness, even if it may require pulling a 
rabbit out of a hat.
The Best Picture slate this year has a little of everything, just 
like your favorite three course meal. Best Picture is typically 
earmarked for dramas, but 2015 presents a main course of 
action drama; a sprinkle of indie spice; and a tall glass of 
comedy. And for desert? One scoop of political thriller sorbet 
to clean your palate. Voila! Bon appétit! Now that dinner is 
served, let’s dig in.
The Big Short
You wouldn’t think that the man behind Anchorman and 
Talladega Nights would be able to tackle such an issue as 
the 2008 crash of the United States housing market and 
achieve it with an artistic self-awareness that audiences 
are not accustomed to. Attempting to entertain, as well as 
educate, writer/director Adam McKay frequently breaks the 
fourth wall to carry the audience along for the ride. The Big 
Short follows a group of off-Wall St. lenders and analysts who 
saw what no one else dared to glance at: the instability of the 
housing market. They plot to short, or bet against, the market 
in anticipation of massive returns when the defaulting bonds 
they have shorted go bust. But when they realize what they 
have done — bet on a broken system — reality takes out 
its bat and takes a big swing for the fences sending our 
guys into a spiral of riches and melancholy understanding. 
Starring Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling, Christian Bale, and Brad 
Pitt, The Big Short was a favorite of mine in 2015 because of 
its light-hearted, human approach to a side of, perhaps, the 
most somber event of the last decade.
Its nomination is well deserved, but I do not anticipate The 
Big Short to take home the prize. The nominations list has 
some heavyweight ?ghters on it, and The Big Short sports 
a mean right hook, but the ?eld seems too stacked for 
producers Brad Pitt, Dede Gardner and Jeremy Kleiner to be 
walking on stage on Oscar Sunday.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, 
Christian Bale; Directing, Adam McKay; Film Editing, Hank 
Corwin; Adapted Screenplay, Charles Randolph and Adam 
McKay
Bridge of Spies
There are certain players in Hollywood that play on another 
level from others. If the director is the head coach, Steven 
Spielberg is Bill Belichick. Tom Hanks is Tom Brady. When 
these two pair up, you can count on the movie being good. 
Bridge of Spies is no exception. Hanks plays James Donovan, 
a Cold War era insurance lawyer chosen to represent 
captured Soviet spy Rudolf Abel (Mark Rylance). Rylance 
delivers the performance of note. Political thrillers run few 
and far between nowadays, but Bridge of Spies is another 
top tier ?lm in 2015.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, Mark 
Rylance; Original Score, Thomas Newman; Production 
Design, Adam Stockhausen; Set Decoration, Rena DeAngelo 
and Bernhard Henrich; Sound Mixing, Andy Nelson, Gary 
Rydstrom, and Drew Kunin; Original Screenplay, Matt 
Charman and Ethan Coen & Joel Coen
Brooklyn
I will admit it: I am a crier. When movies can make me 
well up, that’s a sign that I am thoroughly enjoying myself. 
Congratulations, Brooklyn. Some are calling the lead, Saoirse 
Ronan, a “breakout star,” but I wouldn’t call her a “breakout.” 
She’s been here for years. Nominated for Best Supporting 
Actress in 2007 for her role in Atonement, Ronan delivers 
again as Eilis Lacey, a young Irish girl who immigrates 
to New York in search of a better life. Set in the 1950s, 
Brooklyn’s exploration of themes like family, home, and the 
mysteries of the heart is shown elegantly by director John 
Crowley. The ?lm is visually stunning, with an intriguing 
script that uses the juxtaposition of cultures to its advantage.
Additional nominations: Actress In A Leading Role, Saoirse 
Ronan; Adapted Screenplay, Nick Hornby
Mad Max: Fury Road
Perhaps the biggest “dark horse” nominee among the 
eight nominated ?lms is director George Miller’s wasteland 
road rager. What I remember after eight months since 
its May release are the stunning visual effects, dynamic 
cinematography, and music. Starring Tom Hardy and 
Charlize Theron, Mad Max: Fury Road is an epic journey 
through endless desert to escape the clutches of Immortan 
Joe. It is not a complex story that makes this ?lm as brilliant 
as it is. It is the rooted effort to achieve originality that sets 
Fury Road up for brilliance. Personally, I think Mad Max: Fury 
Road has the smallest chance of winning Best Picture simply 
because of how unlike typical Oscar winners it is. It is not the 
best ?lm of the year, but it is my personal favorite.
Additional nominations: Cinematography, John Seale; 
Costume Design, Jenny Beavan; Directing, George Miller; 
Film Editing, Margaret Sixel; Makeup and Hairstyling, Lesley 
Vanderwalt, Elka Wardega and Damian Martin; Production 
Design, Colin Gibson; Set Decoration, Lisa Thompson; Sound 
Editing, Mark Mangini and David White; Sound Mixing, 
Chris Jenkins, Gregg Rudloff, and Ben Osmo; Visual Effects, 
Andrew Jackson, Tom Wood, Dan Oliver, and Andy Williams
The Martian
Ridley Scott’s The Martian traps Mark Watney on Mars after 
a storm separates him from his team. The team is forced 
to liftoff after connection with Watney is lost. Surviving the 
storm, Mark must retro?t his skills and equipment to survive 
while attempting to make contact with Earth. At face value,  
there’s not much difference than Cast Away or Robinson 
Crusoe but The Martian takes a unique approach to the 
survival story, and not at the expense of character. Watney is 
not the serious survivalist most left-alone stories star. Watney 
is a charismatic man with a self-aware sense of humor. The 
?lm hits on a series of comedic instances that paces the ?lm 
quite nicely. Most of the drama, in fact, takes place back 
on Earth as the world tries to establish contact and wade 
through the public relations disaster that is leaving someone 
alive on Mars. Some are calling Ridley Scott’s not being 
nominated for Best Director one of this year’s most glaring 
snubs, and I am inclined to agree. The pacing, comedic, and 
2016 Oscars Best Picture Nominations Roundup
This year, the Oscar contenders are a good mix of big budget tentpoles and small indie experiments
Mad Max: Fury Road is set in a dystopian future 
where a ruthless warlord known as Immortan Joe 
enslaves humanity and it is up to Max, and Furiosa 
(woman in the poster, right) to stop him.

production elements of The Martian are to be celebrated and, 
though the ?lm did receive a number of other nominations, 
Scott should be congratulated on another successful venture 
into sci-?.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Leading Role, Matt 
Damon; Production Design, Arthur Max; Set Decoration, 
Celia Bobak; Adapted Screenplay, Drew Goddard
The Revenant
Only two directors in history have won back-to-back Best 
Picture awards: John Ford in 1940 (The Grapes of Wrath) and 
1941 (How Green Was My Valley), and Joseph L. Mankiewicz 
in 1949 (A Letter To Three Wives) and 1950 (All About Eve). 
Alejandro G. Iñárritu can join this list with his exposé on 
the resilience of the human spirit and the will to survive. 
Starring Leonardo DiCaprio as hunter/explorer Hugh Glass, 
The Revenant is a powerful ?lm that achieves excellence on 
a number of different levels, none more so than the acting 
and cinematography. Leonardo DiCaprio is a fan favorite 
to win the Best Leading Actor category, and Emmanuel 
Lubezki could be receiving his third consecutive Oscar for 
cinematography, having won in 2013 for Gravity and in 2014 
for Birdman.
Another of my favorites of 2015, The Revenant is being 
discussed as one of the ?lms most likely to take home the 
ultimate prize, though it will not be easy.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Leading Role, Leonardo 
DiCaprio; Actor In A Supporting Role, Tom Hardy; 
Cinematography, Emmanuel Lubezki; Costume Design, 
Jacqueline West; Directing, Alejandro G. Iñárritu; Film 
Editing, Stephen Mirrione; Makeup and Hairstyling, Siân 
Grigg, Duncan Jarman and Robert Pandini; Production 
Design, Jack Fisk; Set Decoration Hamish Purdy; Sound 
Editing, Martin Hernandez and Lon Bender; Sound 
Mixing, Jon Taylor, Frank A. Montaño, Randy Thorn and 
Chris Duesterdiek; Visual Effects, Rich McBride, Matthew 
Shumway, Jason Smith and Cameron Waldbauer
Room
One year ago, an independent ?lm called Whiplash was 
nominated for Best Picture. Audiences stormed theaters 
as a result of the nomination and persistent positive word 
of mouth. The ?lm received a strong following and a hefty 
bump at the box of?ce, all stemming from sheer quality. This 
year, the ?lm I anticipate reaching similar credit is Room. 
Brie Larson plays Ma, a young mother who, seven years 
prior, was abducted and put away in a garden shed called 
“Room.” Now, Ma and her ?ve-year-old son Jack must gain 
their freedom so Jack can experience life outside Room 
for the ?rst time. Director Lenny Abrahamson explores the 
power of love, family, and the beauty of the world despite its 
worst occurrences to present a beautiful ?lm. Based on the 
novel of the same name, Room is adapted for the screen by 
the book’s author Emma Donoghue. Good movies that exist 
strictly within a genre have anticipated reactions. Action 
movies should raise your heart rate. Comedies should make 
you smile. Dramas should make you cry. But great movies 
are able to use elements from all these to fuel its story. On 
a series of occasions, Room had me crying, or smiling, or 
having a heart attack. This is a gripping story and a ?lm 
worth treating yourself to. Larson has already received a 
number of awards for her performance and is my choice for 
Best Leading Actress. Though not nominated, young Jacob 
Tremblay has also been recognized for his performance as 
Jack, and rightfully so.
Additional nominations: Best Leading Actress, Brie Larson; 
Directing, Lenny Abrahamson; Adapted Screenplay, Emma 
Donoghue
Spotlight
I have not seen a courtroom drama accomplish what 
Spotlight was able to. In any number of ways, this ?lm 
could have fallen apart. There are so many moving parts, 
but director Tom McCarthy is able to keep the train on the 
tracks. Certainly one of the best ensemble pieces in recent 
years, Spotlight is the story of the “Spotlight” investigative 
team at the Boston Globe during the development of the 
Pulitzer Prize winning exposé of abuse in the Boston clergy 
in 2001. The brilliance of Spotlight is in the delivery of its 
message. The ?lm is essentially a biopic, meaning we know 
how the story ends. What we may not know, and where the 
delivery lies, is the journey and the characters’ reactions to 
the startling revelations of the story. This was executed with 
an elegance and maturity that you would come to expect 
from champion journalists. There’s no childish shouting 
matches or nonsensical overreaction. Only a gripping and 
disturbingly unsettling story unfolding itself before your eyes.
Additional nominations: Actor In A Supporting Role, Mark 
Ruffalo; Actress In A Supporting Role, Rachel McAdams; 
Film Editing, Tom McArdle; Original Screenplay, Josh Singer 
and Tom McCarthy

After watching The League last summer, I convinced 
myself that I would be good at fantasy football. And 
when I couldn’t convince any of my friends to start 
a league with me, I actually found a public league 
through ESPN, signed up, and competed against 
19 Internet strangers for four months. Team Ya Gurl 
Gutie actually came in eighth place, mostly thanks 
to the research I did every week in order to write 
my column in the sports section. It was probably the 
fiercest challenge I’ve ever faced, and it was nothing 
at all like The League. It did, however, fill me with a 
certain competitive spirit.
With the adrenaline still pumping, The Bachelor 
gave me one of the best late Christmas gifts a girl 
could ask for: thebachelorbracket.com. I really wish 
that Chris Harrison and his army of minions had 
publicized this prior to the season’s premiere, but 
better late than never. I created a league very soon 
after and began my research. It was like draft day. 
I got online, reread everyone’s biographies, stalked 
Ben Higgins — this year’s bachelor — on social 
media to try to figure out his type, and wasted most 
of an afternoon trying to guess who would be going 
home. I thought I would have it nailed. The bracket 
is very simple: every week you select the group of 
girls that will be continuing, thereby purposefully not 
selecting girls that will be going home.
I feel that the Bachelor franchise is really pushing the 
competitive angle this season, with the creation of 
the brackets, but also with the dates. It’s bad enough 
that these women are risking severe heartbreak at 
the hands of Ben Higgins — dreamcake. Plus, you 
have frighteningly aggressive women like Olivia 
and Lace who already do enough to inspire a natural 
sense of competition. It seems as though it couldn’t 
get any more cut throat. But then they’ve been 
making these poor, helpless victims of The Bachelor 
literally compete for his attention.
In week two, he sent them back to high school. 
They had to pair up to compete in challenges like 
creating an erupting volcano in a science fair and 
actually running hurdles, and after each challenge 
one team would get eliminated until the winning 
pair competed against each other for the title of 
homecoming queen. Anything having to do with 
high school already makes me want to punch a hole 
in a wall, so this “challenge” really irritated me. 
At least the only thing on the line was a tiara. But 
then, this week the group date consisted of a soccer 
lesson with Kelley O’Hara and Alex Morgan (of the 
World Cup winning U.S. women’s team), which was 
followed by an actual match. They divided the girls 
into stars and stripes and made them face off. The 
winning team got to go on a date with Ben, and the 
losers had to go back to the mansion.
Unsurprisingly, these challenges are met with a 
good deal of intensity. So they really aren’t even 
competing for his affection; it’s just a chance to earn 
his affection. Twin Emily came out of nowhere to be 
an amazing goalie. My field hockey coach always 
used to yell at us, “sacrifice your body!” and boy, was 
she ever living that. She instantly went from being 
totally off my radar to being one of my favorites. I like 
her spirit.
Sidebar on the twins: it’s my understanding that this 
coming week Ben will be taking them for a two on 
one. This is my absolute least favorite date of every 
season. It always ends so painfully, like one person 
crying on a mountain while the other two take off 
in a helicopter. In this case, we really haven’t even 
gotten a chance to get to know them as individuals. 
But when we finally do, one of them has to leave! I 
think this is cruel. I want them to have a chance to 
be Emily and Haley, not just the twins. We’ll finally 
get to know them, but only when they’re pitted 
against each other. This situation is honestly an 
outrage. Shame on you, Chris Harrison. But honestly 
it’s just a matter of time before E! gives them a 
reality show. Check out http://blondesense702.com/.
And finally, I am thoroughly loving the unraveling of 
Olivia, the epitome of competitiveness. I don’t have 
her making it through week four, but I love that she’s 
in denial. Her ego got so inflated so quickly that it 
popped for us all to enjoy on network television. The 
group date started with her interrupting Ben to take 
him away. She arranges to take him up to a room 
at hotel where the date is taking place, and then 
proceeds to howl “helloooo” from the balcony to the 
other girls, waving like a pageant queen. And when 
she didn’t get the date rose, she noted that when 
Ben stood up he touched her leg. That was his way 
of saying “Sorry, Olivia, you can’t win every time, 
but I’m still thinking about you.” This alone was 
spectacular.
But then right at the cocktail party, Ben announces 
that a couple very close to his family died in an 
airplane crash that morning. He expressed that the 
evening’s conversations would be really important 
to him understanding which women can be there 
for him when he’s feeling low. So naturally, Olivia 
interrupts him again at the beginning to take him 
away to talk. She comforts Ben in his time of need 
by complaining about her cankles, actually shedding 
tears. She received the final rose, which she 
interpreted as some other unfathomable unspoken 
communication. She insisted that they are meant to 
be, and she will be Mrs. Higgins. I expect her to go 
out in a blaze of glory in the very near future.
Week two, which is week one of bracketing, I only 
got one of the girls who did not receive a rose correct 
and that was a woman named Mandi. I knew she 
was just too unapologetically weird to make it that 
far. Definitely not Ben’s type. But I really didn’t 
expect the identical twins to make it through, an 
early judgment I now regret — not just because I lost 
points, but because I’m starting to like them. That 
said, how Lace got a rose was truly beyond me. In 
the end I wasn’t particularly upset about the other 
women leaving, but I hoped Jackie would make it 
further. Anyway, this left me two points back from 
first, an honor belonging to Lula Banker, the Tartan’s 
personnel manager.
In this week’s bracket I still only got one right, and 
that one was Lace. I really did expect to feel more 
joy in her departure. We all knew that she had 
some growing up to do, and it was comforting that 
she knew it too. The part of me that loves reality 
television for the drama did really enjoy the spice she 
added to things while she was there. I was also really 
disappointed to see Shushanna go. I feel like we as 
the Bachelor-viewers of the world were deprived of 
the opportunity to get to know a real gem. We didn’t 
even know that she could speak English until week 
two; there must be so many more layers to peel 
back. And finally, while I felt bad for Jami because 
she just seemed so jazzed to be there, I didn’t 
have any particular feelings about her departure. 
I truly thought Amber was going home after her 
dramatically passive week two, but then she came 
out and won the group date rose this week. I also 
thought he would say goodbye to Lauren H. because 
I just haven’t seen any spark yet. With a two for 
three success rate in week three, I still came out two 
points behind Lula.
Lula’s friend from home, Sarah Waldman, is also in 
our league. She didn’t compete in week two, so her 
points reflect that (that week’s number of points per 
correct guess, cumulatively). I still have a significant 
advantage, but she did very well this week. Hopefully 
she doesn’t get the chance to catch up. I feel like 
once we weed out the randoms and get down to 
ten girls I’ll have a better handle on how all the 
relationships look.
I predict that she’ll be roseless alongside one of the 
twins — right now I say Haley — and also Amber. 
She confronted Ben and Jubilee and lost. She won’t 
recover from that. I feel confident in these picks, so 
hopefully I’ll slide into first.

---------------------------------------------------

Room retention
Room retention, the first phase, is for students planning to retain their current room for 
the next school year. Although there are some exceptions, room retention is available to 
most upperclass students, except those in themed housing, a first-year residence hall or 
apartment, or an RA/CA room. First-year students are not eligible to retain their rooms, 
regardless of their room location. Students considering room retention should remember 
that once they retain, they cannot change or cancel their housing assignment until the 
open cancellation period begins.
Room with a retainer
Students retaining their rooms during the first phase are required to fill any vacancies 
in the room, suite, or apartment with “pull-ins.” In order to be “pulled in” to a room, 
students must be eligible to participate in Room Selection and must not have already 
selected an assignment for the school year.
Block housing
The block housing phase of room selection allows groups of students to select a 
“block” of rooms near each other in one of the applicable residence halls or apartments. 
Students electing to apply for block housing must identify a group representative who 
will be responsible for setting up their block housing group on the housing application 
and will remain the main contact point between the group and Housing Services.
General room selection
General Room Selection is the final phase of Room Selection. During this phase, 
students eligible for housing who haven’t participated in the preceding phases choose 
a room from the remaining spaces. Students planning to participate in general Room 
Selection must apply online. They are then given a random timeslot for Room Selection.
Themed housing
Themed housing allows students to apply for housing centered around a certain 
interest or theme. Themed houses are detailed on page six of this guide.
RA/CA housing
RA/CA housing is only available for those students holding an RA or CA position during 
the 2016–17 school year. These students will not be eligible to participate in Room 
Selection, and will instead be assigned a room through the application and selection 
process carried out by the Office of Student Life.
Gender-neutral housing
Gender-neutral housing, available in the Oakland Community Apartments, permits 
upperclass residents of different genders to reside in the same room. There will also be 
a gender-inclusive housing-themed living community in Morewood Gardens.
Open assignments
Due to fluctuating availability in room assignments, some students are given an 
open assignment. This means that while they are guaranteed a room for the 2016–17 
academic year, they will not immediately know where that room will be located, or 
what style of room they will be assigned. After receiving an open assignment, students 
wait until they receive an offer for a room for the upcoming year. After receiving their 
offer, they can decline the offer and cancel their housing agreement within three days 
without penalty, even if the offer was made after the open cancellation period ends.
For more details about the Room Selection process, visit  
www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection.
Room Selection offers students several options: room retention, room with a retainer (also known as a “pull-in”), block housing, general 
room selection, themed housing, RA/CA housing, gender-neutral housing, and open assignments.
Most students will participate in one of three Room Selection choices: room retention, room with a retainer, or general room selection. 
However, a wide variety of housing options is available to all students. Room Selection begins on Feb. 17, so all students returning next year 
should be actively thinking about their housing plans for the 2016–17 school year.

Phase deadlines and other information 
What’s new for 2016 Room Selection and selection phases
New apartments on Clyde Street open for room selection
This summer, Housing Services will open a new residence comprising 32 single rooms 
and one double room. The building, which is at 618 Clyde Street, will be available for 
Room Selection. The apartments will not be eligible for block housing, and because 
the building won’t be open until the summer, students will not have a chance to view 
the apartments before selecting them. Housing Services will provide floor plans and 
renderings to help students make informed decisions during Room Selection.
Housing Services expands Block Housing options
As Block Housing becomes more popular, Housing Services has decided to expand the 
Block Housing options. As always, Block Housing is available in Morewood Gardens, 
Fairfax Apartments, Webster Hall Apartments, Shirley Apartments, and Shady Oak 
Apartments. There will also be two new eight-person Block Housing options in 
the Margaret Morrison Apartments and two eight-person options in Resnik House. 
Students in groups of six to 12 can apply for Block Housing. To learn more about Block 
Housing, see www.cmu.edu/housing/roomselection/rsoptions/block.

Living on campus vs. living off campus 
Questions to ask and tools to help you decide
Deciding whether or not you want to live on campus next year can be a tough decision. Both on-campus and 
off-campus living have their appeals, and the right option will almost definitely come down to each individual’s 
unique living needs.
Use the chart below to determine the costs of living off campus versus living on campus. The column on the left 
shows what is included in on-campus housing. Ask prospective landlords the cost of each of these items listed 
below and fill in the dollar amount next to the appropriate icon. For items or services that you do not believe are 
applicable to you, write 0 in the blank. Total all costs and compare to the cost of living on campus as you make 
your decision for next year. Chart provided by Housing Services.
If you do choose to live off campus next year, Carnegie Mellon’s off-campus website is a good resource: https://
offcampus.housing.cmu.edu/
Questions to ask when deciding where to live:
If you are considering moving off campus, be sure to ask 
these questions, provided by Housing Services, before you 
sign a lease:
Rent and Additional Costs
Is there an application or holding fee? If yes, what is the 
cost?
What utilities are included in the rent?
How much is the security deposit?
When is the rent due?
Leases
In case you plan to study abroad for part of the school year 
or summer, are variable lease options available (six, nine, or 
12 months)?
Is individual lease liability offered?
How many people is this unit legally zoned for? In the city 
of Pittsburgh, it is illegal for more than three unrelated indi-
viduals to live together in a residential dwelling. 
Do you have a rental license on file with the city of 
Oakland?
Will I be able to sublet my unit in the summer or for study 
abroad?
Repairs and Maintenance
Will any repairs be made to the unit prior to move in?
How quickly do you make repairs when there is a work 
request or maintenance issue?
Do you take before and after pictures to help guarantee I get 
my security deposit back?
Amenities
What type of security does the building offer?
What type of parking is offered?
What appliances are provided, and how old are they?
Who is responsible for yard maintenance and snow 
removal?

Just a 10-to-15-minute walk (or ?ve-minute bus ride) from campus lies Oakland, the 
home of late-night food, University of Pittsburgh pride, and a population made up 
almost entirely of college students. 
Oakland is home to some of Carnegie Mellon students’ favorite restaurants, including 
Con?ict Kitchen, Chipotle, Fuel and Fuddle, and The Porch. For students over 21, 
Oakland has a solid group of late-night destinations, such as Hemingway’s, Mad 
Mex, and a liquor store with an extensive selection. Another bene?t of Oakland is the 
availability of affordable housing close to campus. Oakland Avenue and Atwood Street 
are lined with housing for both Carnegie Mellon and University of Pittsburgh students.
Most people living here are always up for fun; if you’re looking for a quiet 
neighborhood, Oakland may not be your cup of tea. Oakland should be noted for its 
lively atmosphere and is ideal for anyone looking for college-oriented surroundings.
OAKLAND
Shadyside is home to upperclassmen from Carnegie Mellon and the University of 
Pittsburgh, graduate students, and young working professionals. Accessible by bus, it 
tends to be slightly pricier than Oakland or Squirrel Hill; however, it is the most charming of 
the areas surrounding campus, with its tree-lined streets and boutiques. The neighborhood 
is best known for two things: shops and bars. Walnut Street is lined with a wide variety 
of shops, and cozy restaurants like Mercurio’s and The Yard Gastropub are interspersed 
among the shops.
While the area near Shadyside’s bars can be particularly loud from Thursday to Sunday, 
Shadyside is generally a very relaxed, quiet area. The young professionals and the college 
students who live there are diverse  — from artists to technical majors to medical students. 
Shadyside is a great area for anyone looking for either an escape from campus or a popular 
shopping and nightlife experience.

NEARBY NEIGHBORHOODSHOUSING GUIDE
Squirrel Hill starts just up the big hill on Forbes Avenue. It is either a 20-minute walk 
or a three-minute bus ride from campus, and the buses are very frequent. The cost of 
living in Squirrel Hill is higher than in Oakland, but lower than in Shadyside. In addition 
to housing upperclass students from Carnegie Mellon, Squirrel Hill is also home to 
faculty and Pittsburgh families not associated with the university. Squirrel Hill has a 
diversity of restaurants, from Thai food at Silk Elephant to breakfast at the original 
Pamela’s Diner. The restaurants are dispersed among small shops, including those on 
the main thoroughfare of Forbes Avenue.
It is not a college neighborhood like Oakland and Shadyside, and it does not have a 
prominent bar scene. It does have a residential atmosphere, however, that the other 
two areas lack. For someone looking for a short ride or walk from campus with all the 
necessities within walking distance and a wide variety of cuisines, Squirrel Hill may 
be the right place to look for a home to rent.
