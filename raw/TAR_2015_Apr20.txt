Carnival changes to come in 2016
BRIAN TRIMBOLI
Editor-in-Chief
Last weekend’s Spring 
Carnival, the university’s 
101st, was the last one to take 
place on the Morewood park-
ing lot. Next year, Carnival 
will be spread across the Col-
lege of Fine Arts (CFA) park-
ing lot, the CFA lawn, and the 
Mall.
The Morewood parking 
lot, currently the site of Mid-
way, will become unusable 
when construction for the 
upcoming Tepper Quadran-
gle breaks ground. Although 
construction was supposed 
to begin in March, it has been 
pushed back, allowing Carni-
val to stay on the Morewood 
parking lot this year.
The university announced 
plans for the Tepper Quad-
rangle in Nov. 2013 on the 
heels of a $67 million dona-
tion by alumnus David Tep-
per, whose 2003 donation 
of $55 million made him 
the namesake of the Tep-
per School of Business. Al-
though plans for the Tepper 
Quadrangle have not been 
?nalized, the university has 
selected an architecture ?rm 
— Moore Ruble Yudell Archi-
tects & Planners — to design 
the expansion.
The new space is also sup-
ported by about $200 million 
of the university’s own mon-
ey and several smaller alumni 
donations. It will include a 
new building for the Tepper 
School of Business, a univer-
sity welcome center, a tech-
nology-enhanced learning 
center for the Eberly Center, 
?tness and recreation spaces, 
and a 600-seat auditorium.
There are plans to keep 
some space for parking in 
the Tepper Quadrangle, but 
since the plans are not ?nal-
ized it’s unclear whether or 
not Carnival Midway will ?t 
in the new space, according 
to Coordinator of Student Ac-
tivities and advisor to Spring 
Carnival Tim Leonard. Next 
year, Leonard said via email, 
booths will be in the CFA 
parking lot, the main tent will 
be on the CFA lawn, and the 
rides will be on the CFA lawn 
and the Mall. The Carnival 
concert will also take place 
on the Mall.
Although its likely that the 
rides will damage the lawn, 
“One of the reasons we want 
to use the CFA Lawn is its du-
rability,” Leonard continued 
by email. “We expect that 
there may be some damage 
to the lawn, but all of that 
is completely unknown and 
very weather dependent. We 
plan to use plywood to back 
onto the lawn and then use 
wood to disperse the weight 
of the rides so they don’t sink 
into the ground. However, if 
this rains, it could get messy.”
Rides will also be set up 
close to the sidewalk, Leon-
ard said, to keep as much 
pedestrian traf?c as possible 
off of the grass. “If damage 
does occur, we will most like-
ly reseed the lawn, just like 
after Orientation. However, 
because Commencement is 
so close to Carnival, we will 
have to take extra care to 
make sure the appearance 
is appropriate for all of our 
families and guests coming to 
campus that weekend,” Leon-
ard said.
The CFA parking lot and 
lawn was only one of many 
spaces considered for Car-
nival, Leonard said. The list 
of potential locations also 
included Gesling Stadium, 
Morewood Avenue, Marga-
ret Morrison Street, Doherty 
Parking Lot, the East-West 
walkway and Merson Court-
yard, and the fourth ?oor 
of the East Campus Garage. 
Each of these sites, however, 
has its disadvantages. The 
turf of Gesling Stadium, for 
example, would have to be 
covered, a process that is cost 
prohibitive. Additionally, ve-
hicles over 7 ft. tall cannot 
drive into the East Campus 
Garage, which would make 
move on dif?cult.

Affairs Michael Murphy, with

‘Fight for 15’ protestors call for higher wages

Workers from the surrounding Pittsburgh community joined together with Pittsburgh college students on Wednesday to advocate for higher wages.

Shortly after a closure for 
the University of Pittsburgh’s 
annual Bigelow Bash, Bigelow 
Ave. was once again closed to 
traf?c last Wednesday. This 
closure wasn’t for a student 
event; instead a large crowd 
?lled the cordoned-off street 
and rallied around a pickup 
truck. Speakers acted as a 
makeshift stage. The demon-
stration was just one of more 
than 200 across the country 
where fast food workers went 
on strike. Their demands were 
wages increase to $15 an 
hour, and the formation of a 
union. The event was called 
“Fight for 15.”
Members of several local 
unions showed solidarity with 
the fast food workers. Among 
the unions present were 
32BJ SEIU security guards 
and employees of the Univer-
sity of Pittsburgh, including 
adjunct professors, with the 
United Food and Commercial 
Workers Union Local 23, and 
many more. In addition to the 
unions, representatives of nu-
merous places of worship, po-
litical organizations, student 
groups, and even the Westing-
house High School Marching 
Band attended.
Among those giving 
speeches from the back of 
the pickup was Jasiri Oronde 
Smith, who performs as Jasiri 
X. A local activist and emcee, 
Smith was there with 1Hood, 
a local media organization 
that focuses on producing 
socially conscious hip-hop 
with an emphasis on Pitts-
burgh’s black community.
“Pittsburgh is America’s 
most livable city,” Smith told 
the crowd during his set, “so 
why do we have to ?ght for a 
living wage?” 
He also led the crowd in 
several chants and songs, per-
forming his single “Don’t let 
them get away with murder.”
Chris Ellis, an employee 
at the McDonald’s on 3708 
Forbes Ave., had a hoarse 
voice from shouting slogans 
and talking over the din to his 
fellow demonstrators. Ellis 
said he had been part of the 
movement for about a year 
and that he was there that 
day because “It was time for a 
change.”
“We want the same thing 
Martin Luther King did with 
what he did,” Ellis said. “[It’s] 
not just about the 15 and it’s 
not just the union. It’s about 
respect, dignity, and the right 
to organize.”
Elizabeth Massey, who 
works at a Wendy’s, said part 
of the reason for her presence 
was to send a reminder. “I’m 
here because if there were 
no me or them, there would 
not be any easy lunches, no 
medicine pick up … I’m doing 
this for me and my son, who’s 
six.” Massey stressed that 
the support the strikers have 
had has been incredibly wide 
reaching, coming also from 
“Pittsburgh is America’s most 
livable city, so why do we have to 
?ght for a living wage?”

This year’s Midway Open-
ing Ceremony for Spring Car-
nival paid a bittersweet fare-
well to its longstanding place 
on the Morewood Gardens 
parking lot. It touched on the 
new Tepper Quadrangle that 
would take its place, and re-
minded us of the philanthro-
py aspect of Carnival. True 
to Carnegie Mellon tradition, 
the air echoed with the sound 
of bagpipes as Carnival of?-
cially kicked off.
People huddled inside 
the large Alumni Association 
Tent on the Morewood Gar-
dens parking lot while rain 
drizzled outside. Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno 
joked that despite last year’s 
announcement that Midway 
would not take place at the 
Morewood Gardens park-
ing lot, 2015 would now be 
the ?nal year before Midway 
moves to the College of Fine 
Arts Lawn.
“Spring Carnival at Carn-
egie Mellon will always have 
a home,” Casalegno stated 
?rmly.
Casalegno described this 
occasion as “momentous,” 
drawing parallels between 
the all-encompassing essence 
of Spring Carnival and the in-
terdisciplinary nature of the 
future Tepper Quadrangle. 
The Quadrangle is scheduled 
to be built on the Morewood 
gardens parking lot, making 
this occasion also a hand-off.
“[The Tepper Quadrangle] 
is a new chapter in our cam-
pus history that will bring to-
gether the whole of our cam-
pus … where collaboration 
will reign,” Casalegno said. 
“It will be a place where inno-
vation will thrive.”
As for Midway’s new home 
on the CFA lawn, Casalegno 
points out that it would be 
closer to other Carnival ac-
tivities such as Sweepstakes, 
more commonly known as 
Buggy. It would also be locat-
ed at a more central location 
on campus, situated against 
a backdrop of the College of 
Fine Arts building and mod-
ernistic Hunt Library, which

NEWS IN BRIEFStudents ‘dunk-a-cop’ on midway
Students throw balls at a dunk tank for Carnegie Mellon’s Spring Carnival Event “Dunk-a-cop” on Midway this past weekend.

Three Carnegie Mellon 
scientists — professors of 
psychology Roberta Klatzky, 
Lori Holt, and Marlene Beh-
rmann — recently questioned 
gender representation in the 
February 2015 special issue 
of Cognition, “The Changing 
Face of Cognition.”
Klatzsky, Holt, and Beh-
rmann wrote an opinion piece 
in Cognition, stating that they 
were “struck by the fact that 
among the 19 authors listed 
for the 12 articles, only one 
female author was present.”
“As cognitive scientists, 
we know that subtle, even 
unconscious, biases shape 
decision making. We hope 
that by calling attention to 
the gender disparity in in-
vited scienti?c contributions 
we can raise awareness and 
contribute to developing 
inclusive strategies,” Holt, 
who is also a member of the 
Center for the Neural Basis 
of Cognition (CNBC) said in 
a university news release. 
“It is very important that the 
new generation of women in 
cognitive science, and STEM 
?elds generally, recognizes 
that their contributions are 
critical.”
Carnegie Mellon’s own 
Department of Psychology, 
housed in the Dietrich Col-
lege for Humanities and So-
cial Sciences, has 26 full-time 
faculty members, 11 of whom 
are women.
“The fate of women in sci-
ence continues to be prob-
lematic and, although some 
progress has been made, 
many challenges remain,” 
Behrmann, co-director of the 
CNBC, said in the news re-
lease. “These challenges go 
beyond authorship and jour-
nals, and concerted efforts 
need to be mustered to ad-
dress this issue of dispropor-
tionate gender distribution in 
cognitive science and in sci-
ence more generally.”
Researchers question gender representation
INI celebrates 25 years of network research
Students, alumni, and 
visitors to Carnegie Mellon 
saw The Fence painted dur-
ing Carnival in honor of the 
25th anniversary of the In-
formation Networking Insti-
tute (INI).
The INI offers gradu-
ate degrees to students in 
information networking, 
information security, and 
mobility and software man-
agement. These degrees 
teach students skills at the 
intersection of technology, 
economics, and secure net-
works and systems.
“Today, the INI has more 
than 1,500 alumni who are 
in cross-functional positions 
and leadership roles around 
the globe,” said Director of 
the INI Dena Haritos Tsami-
tis in a university news re-
lease. “The INI is proud to 
showcase the accomplish-
ments of its alumni, faculty 
and students in celebration 
of its 25th anniversary.”
The INI was the ?rst pro-
gram of its kind in informa-
tion networking through a 
partnership with Bellcore. 
During Carnival weekend, 
alumnus Hoorman Radfar 
(CIT ’04) gave a keynote to 
celebrate the anniversary.
“Throughout its 25-year 
history, the INI has demon-
strated relevance and agility 
in effectively delivering mul-
tiple interdisciplinary pro-
grams through a variety of 
innovative delivery models,” 
Tsamitis said in the release.

As campus members come 
closer to ?nalizing a strategic 
plan for the university’s fu-
ture, many gathered on Tues-
day in the Posner Center for a 
town hall meeting focused on 
one aspect of the plan: Carn-
egie Mellon’s international 
strategy.
A working group of 32 
people across Carnegie Mel-
lon colleges, programs, and 
campuses have been working 
to re?ne the main points of the 
international strategy through 
previous town halls and col-
laborations with students, fac-
ulty, and staff.
At the head of the interna-
tional strategy working group 
is Vice Provost for Internation-
al Programs and Strategy K. 
Jimmy Hsia, who introduced 
the presenting members of the 
working group. 
Hsia and Vice President for 
Marketing and Communica-
tions Steve Kloehn together 
enumerated the goals of the 
town hall, which included 
voicing new issues and already 
identi?ed ones, collecting 
ideas about Carnegie Mellon’s 
strategic goals and interna-
tional presence, and gathering 
ideas to meet those goals.
First, Director of the Col-
lege of Engineering’s Infor-
mation Networking Institute 
Dena Haritos Tsamitis spoke 
about the state of Carnegie 
Mellon’s existing programs. 
Tsamitis noted that currently 
international programs op-
erate under a decentralized 
model. In other words, in-
dividual Carnegie Mellon 
colleges typically maintain 
international programs inde-
pendently of one another.
Best practices are also only 
passed on informally, and fac-
ulty standards differ among 
programs. For example, some 
faculty are hired speci?cally 
for the programs while others 
spend time at the main cam-
pus before becoming involved 
with international programs. 
There is a broad range of pro-
grams, most offering master’s 
degrees, with varied sizes and 
ties to Carnegie Mellon’s Pitts-
burgh campus.
Tsamitis asked attending 
members how Carnegie Mel-
lon should measure the suc-
cess and impact of interna-
tional programs. Tsamatis also 
stressed how the university 
should plan for program sus-
tainability, develop exit strate-
gies, and measure opportunity 
costs.
Next, Manfred Paulini, a 
professor of physics, spoke 
about bringing Carnegie Mel-
lon’s cultural values to other 
campuses and programs, and 
vice versa. He asked the au-
dience what the essentials 
of Carnegie Mellon’s culture 
are, as well as what de?nes a 
Carnegie Mellon experience.
He said that, at the main 
campus, further integration 
of U.S. and international stu-
dents must occur. He noted 
that the university needs to 
identify international stu-
dents’ needs and address them 
with the appropriate resourc-
es.
Last, the town hall ad-
dressed a need to provide in-
centives for student, faculty, 
staff, and alumni to spend time 
at international locations.
“As an institution, we’re 
de?nitely turning a corner in 
our relative view of thinking 
more about what is our net 
impact in the world, both as 
an institution and in the ex-
plosion of our graduates and 
alumni out into the world,” 
said Vice President for Cam-
pus Affairs Michael Murphy 
from the audience.
Murphy asked those at-
tending to ask themselves to 
what end programs and con-
nections are being forged: 
“What good in the world can 
we do that we’re not doing 
now?”
Assistant professor of 
physics Shirley Ho presented 
emerging international op-
portunities with Heinz College 
and Dietrich College for Hu-
manities and Social Sciences 
associate teaching professor 
Joseph Mertz.
They asked how the univer-
sity can distill its experience 
with other programs into a 
set of best practices and poli-
cies for new opportunities, as 
well as how Carnegie Mellon 
should select new program or 
campus opportunities.
Ho and Mertz then present-
ed a number of potential prin-
ciples to guide new opportuni-
ties, including what potential 
societal changes programs will 
have, what research opportu-
nities they will provide, and 
whether they need to be rev-
enue positive from the start.
Last, Associate Dean of 
the School of Computer Sci-
ence Philip Lehman and Hsia 
closed regarding a draft mis-
sion statement for Carnegie 
Mellon’s international strat-
egy. They asked the audience 
for feedback on the statement: 
“We are — and we educate 
— Citizens of the World. 
CMU’s strategic goal for in-
ternational engagement is to 
provide world class research 
and education in partner-
ship with a global community 
of various cultures, diverse 
backgrounds, and countries, 
without the borders of a cam-
pus, to achieve broad societal 
impact.”

other vice presidents, made 
the ?nal decision of Carnival’s 
location. 
The proposal for the new 
location, however, was the 
work of many parts of the 
university’s administration, 
including the Of?ce of Stu-
dent Activities, the Division 
of Student Affairs, Risk Man-
agement, University Police, 
and Campus Design & Facility 
Management, among others. 
Several student organizations 
also contributed to the pro-
posal, including the Spring 
Carnival Committee, AB Con-
certs, AB Tech, Sweepstakes, 
and any organization that 
typically builds a booth. Leon-
ard also hosted a town hall 
meeting to garner student 
opinions, and presented the 
proposed changes to Student 
Government.
The new location will not 
affect the rules for booth, 
Leonard said. “The plan as of 
right now is that there will be 
no major changes,” Leonard 
noted in the email. “What will 
change drastically is the lay-
out of Midway and how close 
the booths are to each other. 
However, that all depends 
on who wants to build next 
year. If we were to pick up 
Midway 2015 and move it the 
CFA Parking Lot, it would ?t. 
However, we couldn’t ?t many 
more booths.”
Now that the new location 
is ?nalized, Leonard said, Stu-
dent Activities and the Spring 
Carnival Committee can start 
doing more detailed analy-
sis to determine what other 
adjustments will need to be 
made to the structure of Mid-
way and the regulations of the 
Booths and Midway.
“I think my favorite part 
about Booth and about Car-
nival is the families walking 
through the Booths, and I 
think I’m worried that having 
them on the CFA parking lot 
and lawn will deter families 
from coming,” junior electri-
cal and computer engineer-
ing major and Booth Chair of 
Kappa Alpha Theta Rebecca 
Wol?nger said. “If families 
can still come, though, then 
there’s no reason why CFA 
lawn won’t still make for a suc-
cessful Carnival experience.”

non-Pittsburghers. Massey 
speci?cally mentioned an out-
of-towner from Philadelphia 
coming to volunteer their car 
for the cause.
She was convinced that the 
day’s activities would have an 
impact, saying, “I believe we 
will make it.” This sentiment 
was echoed around 5 p.m. 
when the protest turned into 
a march, pushing on to Forbes 
Avenue and halting traf?c. 
A further police cordon was 
set up at the intersection of 
Forbes and Meyran Avenues, 
which the protesters slowly 
marched toward. 
The Westinghouse March-
ing Band took the lead, while 
the protesters unfurled ban-
ners and waved signs de-
manding higher wages and 
respect, for the most part — A 
few signs bore statements as-
sociated with the Black Lives 
Matter movement. Also car-
ried was a puppet in the like-
ness of Greg Peaslee, UPMC’s 
senior vice presidnt for human 
resources.
When the protesters 
reached Meyran Ave., they 
abruptly turned left and 
crowded around the entrance 
to the Iroquois Building. 
There, they posted “public no-
tices” revoking UPMC’s char-
ity status, and chanted “UPMC 
you are not a charity!” 
Continuing onward to the 
McDonald’s on Forbes, the 
protesters began sitting down 
to chants of “Whose streets? 
Our streets!”
Rev. Rodney Lyde of the 
Baptist Temple Church ad-
dressed the crowd there and 
reiterated points about the 
fact that Pittsburgh, named 
the most livable city by the 
media, still had immense in-
come inequality and poverty. 
He also cheered the groups’ 
success in marching.
“I thought McDonald’s is 
supposed to be open 24 hours 
a day,” he said to the crowd 
sitting on the pavement in 
front of the shuttered restau-
rant, “But this doesn’t look too 
open. I do believe we shut it 
down!”
After his address the crowd 
began moving again until it re-
turned to Schenley Plaza, near 
where the march had begun 
earlier in the day. There, the 
chief organizer of the event, 
Bempoma Pieterson, a politi-
cal science and communica-
tions major at the University of 
Pittsburgh, thanked all of the 
participants in the march and 
declared it a rousing success.
“They were begging us to 
get out of the street,” she told 
the assembled strikers, pro-
testers, and onlookers. “We 
backed the traf?c all the way 
up to the parkway.”
The assembly began break-
ing up around 6 p.m., though 
many stayed in the plaza to 
discuss both the day’s event 
and what actions they might 
take in the future to accom-
plish their goal.
often lights up at night in 
colors.
Toward the end of her 
speech, Casalegno said to the 
audience, “You all should be 
very proud of your efforts and 
in bringing to the Carnegie 
Mellon campus this wonderful 
weekend”.
Casalegno concluded by 
cutting the ribbon to Mid-
way’s entrance. The Carnegie 
Mellon Pipes and Drums pipe 
band played several songs. A 
couple members of the Spring 
Carnival Committee then took 
the stage to speak about the 
philanthropy of Carnival.
Senior communication de-
sign major and head of design 
and marketing for Spring Car-
nival Sam Ahmed commented, 
“As head of marketing, some-
thing I’ve really been trying to 
do this year is bringing Carni-
val to a position where we can 
give back to the community.”
Ahmed spoke about this 
year’s philanthropy part-
ner, Habitat for Humanity of 
Greater Pittsburgh, an orga-
nization that aims to elimi-
nate “substandard housing 
in Allegheny County and to 
make decent shelter a matter 
of conscience and action,” ac-
cording to its website. The or-
ganization builds and restores 
homes with the help of local 
volunteers, low-income fami-
lies (for whom the homes are 
being built), and donations.
Ahmed pointed out two dif-
ferent ways that people could 
donate. One way is to vote for 
a favorite booth by placing 
money in its corresponding 
donation box. The second way 
to donate would be through 
a crowdrise.com campaign, 
which could be found either 
online at the Carnegie Mel-
lon Spring Carnival Facebook 
page or at www.crowdrise.
com/cmucarnival.
As the ceremony concluded 
with performances by the Kilt-
ie Band, audience members 
began to stream out of the tent 
to peruse the newly opened 
booths on Midway.

Although it can be unpleas-
ant, pain is a necessary sensa-
tion that informs us when 
something is wrong. However, 
when that sensation becomes 
unbearable, the nerve im-
pulses that cause pain must be 
inhibited; that is where drugs 
such as morphine come into 
play. Morphine and its deriva-
tives are classi?ed as opioids, 
which are pain-relieving sub-
stances. Opioids also happen 
to be addictive; psychologi-
cal dependence can develop 
within a few doses. The body 
also builds up resistance to 
opioids rapidly, requiring a 
higher dosage to effectively 
alleviate pain.
Such characteristics of 
opioids have lead researchers 
to pursue methods to circum-
vent both the resistance and 
addictive response of the body 
to these drugs. Researchers 
at Carnegie Mellon have re-
cently tackled this subject in 
an effort to better understand 
the mechanisms by which 
neurons become resistant to 
opioids. The team consists of 
Manojkumar Puthenveedu, 
assistant professor of bio-
logical sciences at Carnegie 
Mellon, and researchers em-
ployed in his lab, including 
Shanna Bowman, Amanda 
Soohoo, and Daniel Shiwar-
ski, doctoral candidates in 
biological sciences at Carn-
egie Mellon. The group tested 
neuronal response to various 
substances to determine what 
mechanisms are at work in 
neurons as they become in-
creasingly resistant to opioid 
stimulation.
Put simply, when a body 
experiences pain, a peptide, 
or small protein, called Sub-
stance P activates a receptor 
on the surface, or soma, of 
a neuron. Opioid molecules 
counteract the pain sensation 
by binding to mu-opioid re-
ceptors on the neuron’s sur-
face. There are a few other 
types of opioid receptors, but 
since the “mu” in mu-opioid 
refers to morphine, these re-
ceptors were the best study 
specimens. The signal is inter-
nalized, and it initiates a cas-
cade of signals within the cell 
which inhibit pain responses. 
In order for this mechanism 
to work, however, receptors 
must be present. Using high-
resolution ?uorescent imag-
ing techniques developed by 
Puthenveedu himself, the re-
search team was able to visu-
alize neuron receptors in real 
time. This allowed them to 
test different opioid substanc-
es and observe the reaction of 
the receptors as the interac-
tions happened.
“Understanding how re-
ceptor localization changes 
in response to pain and medi-
cation is a different way to 
address the challenge of de-
veloping a non-addictive anal-
gesic drug,” Puthenveedu said 
in a university press release. 
“If we can control what hap-
pens to the receptor after the 
drug activates it, we might be 
able to better control how the

From nasty colds to the 
chickenpox, we all have to 
face infections from viruses 
at some point in our lifetime. 
But did you know that there 
is a virus that infects organ-
isms many times smaller 
than you? In the early 1900s, 
scientists started to notice a 
group of viruses that infect 
and lyse bacteria, the bil-
lions of microorganisms that 
are prevalent virtually every-
where on Earth. Coined as 
bacteriophages, or “phages” 
for short, these bacterial vi-
ruses were named for their 
“bacteria eating” ability.
Like all viruses, bacterio-
phages carry nucleic acid that 
is encased within a capsid, 
or coat, of protein. The cap-
sid can be thought of as the 
head of a bacteriophage. The 
nucleic acid of the phage can 
either be most commonly in 
the form of deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA), or ribonucleic 
acid (RNA). In either case, 
the nucleic acid serves as the 
genetic material of the bac-
teriophage. Genetic material 
is important as it gives the 
essential instructions neces-
sary for the phages to be able 
to function and propagate.
Bacteriophages come in 
three different structural 
forms. A bacteriophage 
can have an icosahedral — 
twenty-sided — head with 
a tail. During infection, the 
tail serves as a hollow tube 
that serves as a passageway 
for nucleic acid during infec-
tion. Another type of bacte-
riophage has an icosahedral 
head, but no tail. Addition-
ally, a bacteriophage can 
come in a ?lamentous, rod-
like, form.
So how did scientists 
come across these creatures 
that cannot be seen even un-
der the most powerful light 
microscope? According to 
a review in the Journal of 
Chemical Technology and 
Biotechnology, the ?rst bacte-
riophage activity was found 
in river water, reported in a 
paper published in a French 
journal in 1896. In this paper, 
Ernest Hanbury Hankin, a 
British bacteriologist, noticed 
that the river water was effec-
tive in preventing the spread 
of cholera, a severe bacterial 
disease that had frequent out-
breaks in India. However, it 
took 20 more years before the 
existence of bacteriophages 
was actually con?rmed by 
American scientist Frederick 
Twort and French scientist 
Felixe d’Herelle.
The discovery was fol-
lowed by many studies that 
showed the potential of bac-
teriophages in curing bacte-
rial infections. For instance, 
in 1919, d’Herelle prepared 
bacteriophages that were 
administered to patients at a 
hospital in Paris. The phage 
preparation was made to 
treat patients with bacterial 
dysentery. Patients were then 
reported to have recovered 
within 24 hours of treatment.
With their ability to elim-
inate symptoms of bacte-
rial infection, you might be 
wondering how these bacte-
riophages work. In order to 
survive as a group of viruses, 
the bacteriophages must 
?nd a way to replicate them-
selves. This is accomplished 
through a series of reactions 
during the infection cycle.
During the ?rst step of the 
infection process, the phage 
settles on a bacterial cell by 
attaching to speci?c recep-

Recently, Congress has 
awarded two Carnegie 
Mellon undergraduate stu-
dents, Joshua Kubiak and 
Jillian Jaycox, with presti-
gious Barry M. Goldwater 
Scholarships. Congress 
established the Barry M. 
Goldwater Scholarship and 
Excellence in Education 
Program in 1986 to provide 
college students support in 
pursuing a research career 
in science, mathematics, 
and engineering.
Kubiak is a junior mate-
rials science and engineer-
ing and chemistry double 
major. He is also a research 
assistant in the lab of Mi-
chael Bockstaller, a materi-
als science and engineering 
professor at Carnegie Mel-
lon, investigating improved 
methods for creating quan-
tum dot backlights for LCD 
screens. On campus, Kubiak 
is a member of Engineers 
Without Borders, the Carne-
gie Mellon racing team, and 
is president-elect of Chem-E 
Car.
“I am honored to receive 
the award and thankful for 
the research opportunities 
that CMU made available 
to me starting in my ?rst se-
mester of college,” Kubiak 
said. “I am also very ex-
cited to continue research 
as a senior and eventu-
ally as a graduate student 
in materials science and 
engineering.”
Kubiak intends to com-
plete a Ph.D. in material 
science engineering and 
“investigate novel polymeric 
materials for alternative en-
ergy generation and teach as 
a university professor.”

Researchers develop invisble objects
Previous attempts at mak-
ing invisible objects have de-
pended on metamaterials — 
arti?cial materials engineered 
to have properties that are not 
naturally occurring. However, 
physicists from the Ioffe Insti-
tute and Australian National 
University have recently cre-
ated cylindrical objects that 
are not only invisible in the 
microwave range, but do not 
require additional metamate-
rial coatings.
The scientists made this 
discovery by studying the way 
light scatters in a glass cylinder 
?lled with water. They found 
that at high refractive indexes, 
light scatters via two mecha-
nisms — resonant and non-
resonant scattering — and 
that at certain frequencies, the 
light scattered through these 
two mechanisms cancels itself 
out, making the object appear 
invisible. The results from this 
study have been published in 
Scienti?c Reports.

Tests can predict risk of breast cancer
Researchers at the Univer-
sity of Copenhagen, in col-
laboration with the Danish 
Cancer Society, have created 
a metabolic blood pro?le test 
that can predict whether an 
individual will develop breast 
cancer in the next two to ?ve 
years with an 80 percent 
sensitivity.
Blood samples taken from 
participants 20 years ago and 
stored in liquid nitrogen were 
compared with more recent 
blood samples from the same 
group of people, some of 
whom had developed breast 
cancer two to seven years 
since giving the ?rst sample. 
Instead of studying a single 
biomarker, which is a common 
procedure in medical science, 
the researchers analyzed all of 
the compounds in the blood 
samples and found a pattern 
that predicts the cancer. The 
test will have to be better vali-
dated before it can be used 
commercially.

SpaceX rocket has rough landing 
Last Tuesday, an un-
manned SpaceX rocket took 
off from Cape Canaveral, Flor-
ida to send a cargo ship to the 
International Space Station. 
The supply capsule was suc-
cessfully sent on its way, but 
the booster rocket did not do 
as well. While booster rockets 
usually burn up in Earth’s at-
mosphere or fall back into the 
ocean after a launch, SpaceX 
is attempting to develop boost-
ers that can land safely and be 
used again, thus reducing the 
cost of space travel.
The booster from Tuesday’s 
launch was supposed to land 
on a customized platform sta-
tioned 200 miles off the coast 
of Jacksonville, Florida, but, 
unfortunately, it landed too 
hard. According to a tweet 
from SpaceX founder Elon 
Musk, the rocket “landed ?ne, 
but excess lateral velocity 
caused it to tip over post land-
ing.”

T-rex may have been hunted by others
Scientists recently ana-
lyzed a 75-million-year-old 
tyrannosaur skull and jaw dis-
covered in 1994 in Dinosaur 
Provincial Park in Alberta, 
Canada. The fossils belonged 
to a Daspletosaurus, the 30 
foot long and two ton cousin 
of the better known Tyran-
nosaurus rex. Despite the 
estimated young age of the 
Daspletosaurus being studied, 
a number of scars were found 
on its skull and jaw. One punc-
ture wound on the back of the 
skull was particularly notice-
able. The scientists also found 
that some injuries appeared 
healed while others were not, 
indicating that some occurred 
while the dinosaur was alive. 
Based on the sizes and shapes 
of the scars, the researchers 
concluded that the injuries 
were in?icted by large, carniv-
orous dinosaurs, most likely 
other tyrannosaurs.

Robot chef cooks gourmet meals
Engineers at Moley Robot-
ics in the UK have developed 
a robotic chef that can cook 
high quality meals in just a 
matter of minutes. The system 
is called the Automated Kitch-
en and its consumer version, 
when developed, will come 
with a library of recipes that 
users can pick from and down-
load. The robot’s arms were 
made by Shadow Robot Com-
pany, the same company that 
develops products for NASA.
The robotic chef’s talent 
is directly derived from pro-
fessional chef Tim Anderson. 
Anderson was recorded while 
cooking with motion-capture 
gloves and his movements 
were translated into algo-
rithms for the robotic chef. 
The makers of the robot be-
lieve that their robotic chef 
will not make real chefs ob-
solete — instead, it will give 
chefs a new way to get their 
recipes out to the public.

mune response to bloodstream 
fungal infections. Jaycox also 
designs DNA nanoparticles 
made of backbone-branched 
DNA with Subha R. Das, an as-
sociate professor of chemistry 
at Carnegie Mellon.
Jaycox runs with the uni-
versity’s cross-country and 
track teams and works as 
co-president of The Triple He-
lix, a student journal which 
publishes about science, soci-
ety, and law.
“I am excited to win the 
Goldwater Scholarship,” Jay-
cox said. “This award is a re-
?ection of the mentorship and 
opportunities provided to me 
by both Carnegie Mellon and 
[the] University of Pittsburgh, 
and it is a promising stepping-
stone toward my goal of be-
coming a physician-scientist.”
She hopes to obtain an 
M.D./Ph.D. in immunology 
and to “conduct research on au-
toimmune disease or infectious 
disease and practice medicine 
in an academic setting.”
“With this career, I ulti-
mately hope to improve the 
biomedical understanding 
of immunological diseases in 
order to improve the lives of 
patients suffering from these 
disorders,” Jaycox said.
Kubiak and Jaycox join the 
260 college sophomores and

and Jaycox will also join a

body responds to opioids.”
First, the team activated 
a neuron’s mu-opioid re-
ceptors using a compound 
called DAMGO, a biologi-
cally analogous opioid pep-
tide which is speci?ed to 
work on mu-opioid recep-
tors. After being affected 
by DAMGO, only a fraction 
of the mu-opioid receptors 
returned to the surface, ex-
plaining in part the reason 
for neurons’ decreased sen-
sitivity over time. If there 
are fewer receptors, the ef-
fect of the drug will be less-
ened.
After administering 
DAMGO, the team intro-
duced the neuron to Sub-
stance P, mimicking a pain 
response. The pain brought 
the receptors back to the 
surface — effectively recy-
cling them. However, when 
morphine was substituted 
for DAMGO, this effect was 
not observed. The team also 
applied a substance called 
fentanyl, an opioid often 
used as an anesthetic, which 
is around ninety times the 
potency of morphine and 
twenty times the potency of 
heroin. When fentanyl was 
administered, the results 
mimicked the DAMGO trial.
As research on pain 
and pain-relief continues, 
we become ever closer to 
understanding the mecha-
nisms behind these sen-
sations and reactions. In 
time, scientists may elimi-
nate the heavily addictive 
properties of morphine and 
perhaps even develop com-
pletely non-addictive pain 
relievers.
tors present on the surface. Fi-
bers allow for the hollow tail to 
push through the bacterial en-
velope, which is partly digested 
by enzymes from the phage. 
Once the tail penetrates the 
surface, DNA from the head is 
now able to pass through the 
hollow tube and into the cell. 
After the injection, the remain-
ing bacteriophage, still located 
on the outside of the bacteri-
um, is void of genetic material.
From there, the next steps 
taken in the cycles differ, de-
pending on whether the phage 
is lytic or lysogenic.
For lytic phages, only one 
path is followed after the in-
jection of the phage DNA. As 
the injected phage DNA mul-
tiplies during the lytic cycle, 
phage capsids are also being 
produced within the host bac-
terium. The phage DNA, along 
with the host DNA, is then 
packaged into the capsids. In 
turn, new phages are created 
within the bacterium.
Afterwards, the bacterium 
undergoes lysis, or the disin-
tegration of a cell through the 
breakdown of the bacterial cell 
membrane. Consequently, this 
process causes the release of 
mature phages. While many of 
the newly made phages possess 
the DNA of the original phage, 
a couple of them contain DNA 
fragments of the previously 
occupied host bacterium. The 
newly released phages then go 
on to repeat the cycle, which 
involves the infection and de-
struction of more bacteria.
In contrast with lytic phag-
es, lysogenic phages can either 
proceed to replicate within the 
lytic cycle, or they can enter a 
dormant state within the cell. 
During the dormant state, the 
phage DNA usually becomes 
incorporated into the host 
DNA. As a result, the bacterial 
cell may acquire new proper-
ties from the added genes of 
the phage, such as the ability 
to produce toxins. Prophage is 
the term for the phage in this 
integrated state.
Despite their seeming inac-
tivity, lysogenic phages have 
been proven to be valuable in 
scienti?c studies, as they are 
able to manipulate some of the 
properties of a bacterial cell.
In addition, the lysogenic 
phages have the ability to enter 
the lytic cycle at any time. Such 
transition is usually triggered 
by the exposure of the bacte-
rium to harsh environmental 
conditions, including exposure 
to ultraviolet rays or mutation-
causing chemicals.
Even with the medical 
promise found within bacterio-
phages, phage therapy is still 
relatively uncommon. This is 
mainly due to the fact that crit-
ics attacked d’Herelle’s early 
studies and were unable to 
replicate them, which cast sus-
picison on the results. While 
phage therapy is still practiced 
in Eastern Europe and the for-
mer Soviet Union, this practice 
has long ceased in the Western 
world. The controversy  about 
d’Herelle’s work, combined 
with the rise of antibiotics, 
eventually led to a rejection of 
phage therapy.
Often prescribed by doctors 
to treat bacterial infections, 
antibiotics have become a 
household staple in the medi-
cal cabinet since the discovery 
of penicillin in 1928. However, 
the overuse of antibiotics has 
led to their decreasing ef?cacy 
in treating bacterial infections, 
as the elimination of a large 
population of bacteria has led 
to the emergence of stronger 
and more resistant bacteria.
As antibiotic resistance 
becomes a growing threat to 
public health, there has been 
a renewed interest in phage 
therapy. Phages are highly 
speci?c and are easy to modify 
when they attack bacterial 
targets. The extensive use of 
phage therapy in Eastern Eu-
rope and the former Soviet 
Union has been proven safe to 
patients as well as commer-
cially viable. With increasing 
knowledge of bacteriophages’ 
abilities, phage therapy may be 
an answer to the woes of many 
Western scientists, doctors and 
patients in the ?ght against 
bacterial diseases.

Special to the Tartan
Last weekend, three mem-
bers of Pugwash drove to 
Purdue University to attend 
the Purdue Student Pugwash 
Conference. The Purdue Stu-
dent Pugwash Conference is 
a two-day-long event with 
talks focused around a theme. 
This year’s theme was global 
sustainability.
The conference began with 
a talk on the Ebola virus by 
Robert Stahelin, an adjunct 
associate professor of chem-
istry and biochemistry at the 
University of Notre Dame. 
Stahelin’s research focuses on 
a viral matrix protein found in 
the Ebola virus called VP40. 
VP40 plays a central role in 
the assembly and budding of 
the virus. Unlike Ebola, VP40 
is not dangerous to humans, 
meaning that it can be stud-
ied without the major safety 
precautions needed for Ebola, 
which are expensive and rare. 
Stahelin’s lab has found new 
methods of slowing down the 
growth rate of VP40 in cells, 
which hopefully can be used 
in new treatments for Ebola.
The second talk was by 
Klein Ilegeji, an associate pro-
fessor of agricultural and bio-
logical engineering at Purdue 
University. Ilegeji’s talk fo-
cused on achieving a commer-
cial bioenergy industry from 
biomass. Bioenergy is energy 
acquired from materials de-
rived from biomass such as 
wood, corn, and agricultural 
byproducts. Increasing bio-
energy, Ilegeji argued, would 
improve America’s energy in-
dependence and stimulate the 
domestic economy. The vari-
ety in density, shape, size, and 
water content of biomass leads 
to substantial bottlenecks in 
transportation and use.
Ilegeji argued that one 
possible solution to this prob-
lem would be to standardize 
biomass as pellets with high 
density and low-water content 
that are aerobically stable. 
These pellets could be trans-
ported using the supply chain 
currently used for feedstock. 
Due to their low water con-
tent, they would also work 
well in bioenergy plants with-
out large amounts of pre-pro-
cessing. At the end of his talk, 
Ilegeji was asked about the 
ef?ciency and environmen-
tal impact of bioenergy from 
crops such as corn. He argued 
that the energy produced by 
bioenergy was more than the 
energy used to grow the bio-
mass. However, the environ-
mental impact of bioenergy is 
still a contentious issue.
The second day began with 
a talk by Maureen McCann, 
the director of the Energy 
Center at Purdue. Her talk fo-
cused on attempts to increase 
the amount of fuel collected 
per acre of land. She began 
by describing better varieties 
of corn for biomass accumu-
lation, which can double the 
biomass yield and use only a 
tenth of the fertilizer. She next 
discussed how conventional 
biomass-to-ethanol processes 
convert only one third of the 
carbon into fuel. One par-
ticularly underused material 
is lignin, which is currently 
burned off. Lignin makes up 
15 to 25 percent of biomass, 
but contains 40 percent of the 
energy. Recent research has 
led to a new process that can 
turn lignin into a hydrocar-
bon with a greater-than-100 
octane rating at a 93 percent 
yield. This, too, could increase 
the amount of fuel collected 
per acre of land.
After this, there was a talk 
led by an anti-GMO activist, 
followed by the ?nal talk by 
Sharlissa Moore, the presi-
dent of Student Pugwash USA. 
She discussed the history of 
Pugwash and the growing 
need for ethics education at 
the societal and institutional 
level. Children are frequently 
taught ethics at the personal 
level. For example, they are 
told not to lie and not to steal. 
However, as our society grows 
in size and scale, large-scale 
questions such as implications 
of human enhancement tech-
nology and who gets to engi-
neer tomorrow’s climate be-
come just as important. Moore 
argued that these issues of 
“macro” ethics must be part of 
our education in order to have 
a sustainable society.
The visiting members of 
Pugwash had no idea what to 
expect from this conference. 
As the only students from an 
outside university, they were 
warmly welcomed by oth-
ers. Nearly all speakers were 
well-informed and provided 
an interesting take on sustain-
ability. Pugwash will certainly 
be back next year for another 
great conference.
Student Pugwash is a non-
advocacy, educational organi-
zation that discusses the impli-
cations of science. This article 
is a summary of a conference 
Pugwash attended last week.

On Tuesday, Apr. 14, Elon Musk’s 
transport service company, SpaceX, 
launched a rocket for the second time 
this year. Onlookers had high hopes, 
but were disappointed when the 
rocket crashed and exploded upon 
landing. 
Even though the mission had been 
a resounding success for SpaceX it-
self — which celebrated hitting the 
landing site at all — questions still 
?ew over whether SpaceX was actu-
ally a new face of the space industry 
or just a high-tech pretender.
In 2013, critics circulated a video 
of a car made by Tesla — another 
company owned by Musk — catch-
ing ?re after crashing into a pole on 
a highway. 
The accident was notable in its 
isolation; no other Tesla engine had 
caught ?re before, while crashes 
cause ?res in dozens of other brands 
on a weekly basis. The survivors of 
the accident walked away unscathed, 
but Tesla’s reputation didn’t. 
For critics, one failure was enough 
to pull Tesla off its pedestal, leading 
to a 6 percent drop in the price of 
Tesla stock over the course of several 
hours.
It seems that everything that 
goes wrong for Musk is instantly el-
evated to a disaster of epic propor-
tions. Musk is not given the privilege 
of trial and error. This tendency to 
try and smack down technological 
progress at any hint of imperfection 
is a dangerous symptom of American 
anti-intellectualism and resistance to 
change.
The basis of resistance to technol-
ogy relies on comparing progress to 
perfection rather than old technol-
ogy. Cars catch ?re when they crash 
into poles quite often, but the public 
jumped on Tesla after a single freak 
accident. In crashes, Teslas have been 
proven safer and less likely to com-
bust than other car brands. Following 
the accident of 2013, Tesla soon add-
ed ?reproof titanium underbodies to 
all of its cars free of charge.
Tesla had the guts to admit its mis-
takes, and to be proactive in ?xing 
them. However, people often think 
that new technology is unusable if 
it’s not perfect. The status quo works 
“just ?ne” — except when it clearly 
doesn’t. When we use separate stan-
dards for new and old technologies, 
we keep those new technologies from 
gaining mainstream acceptance or 
improving the status quo. If we look 
at NASA, many rockets and other 
space vehicles fail in testing. 
Unlike SpaceX, though, NASA 
and similar organizations are given 
both the bene?t of the doubt and the 
resources to improve their designs. 
There’s no reason to believe that two 
crashes mean that SpaceX will never 
build a totally functional rocket. If 
anything, a public launch without 
any prior failed tests would be cause 
for concern; a product that never 
fails in tests will never succeed in the 
market.
In order to create an environment 
conducive to progress, people have to 
give that progress a chance. SpaceX’s 
most recent failure was public, but 
that does not diminish their accom-
plishments. 
The rocket did not stick the land-
ing here, but its ultimate success will 
rely on baby steps: its tests, failures, 
and the lessons SpaceX takes from 
each. Meeting temporary failure by 
calling Elon Musk delusional and in-
novation wasteful is a great way to 
ensure the future never comes.

Students meet President Suresh halfway for second annual meeting
This Wednesday, President Subra 
Suresh will be holding an annual 
update to highlight the university’s 
milestones and share thoughts on 
the university’s future. Following 
the presentation, there will be a 
Q&A session open to faculty, staff, 
and students both in and outside of 
Pittsburgh.
In the past academic year, 
President Suresh led a listening tour 
tailored to students, parents, staff, 
faculty, and alumni that focused on 
setting priorities for the university. 
Suresh also announced the launch 
of a university-wide strategic plan-
ning process to map the direction of 
the university for the next ?ve to 10 
years. This planning process was a 
result of the input he received dur-
ing his listening tours.
Although it’s commendable 
that President Suresh has spear-
headed important campus initia-
tives and updated the campus 
with positive announcements, 
there is still much to be done. 
As a leader of the campus com-
munity, President Suresh has an 
obviously in?uential presence. 
However, most of Suresh’s 
rhetoric has typically consisted of 
buzzwords that, despite promot-
ing the university’s overall repu-
tation, have little to do with the 
majority of students’ current con-
cerns. Carnegie Mellon’s iden-
tity and global reputation may be 
critical to our future, but there 
are issues closer to home as well.
The Tartan is glad to see Presi-
dent Suresh facilitating another 
productive discussion and inviting 
student input. However, it is also 
important for students to bring 
thoughtful questions and concerns 
to the table. 
President Suresh has already 
established himself as a commu-
nity listener, so it’s the campus 
community’s responsibility to be 
vocal and help the university move 
forward.
President Suresh’s annual update 
will be in McConomy Auditorium, 
this Wednesday at 4 p.m. The pre-
sentation will also be available live 
online. 
JFC budgeting process must improve transparency 
Each semester, every under-
graduate and graduate student pays 
an activities fee of $123 and $99, 
respectively. 
The Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC) allocates most of the money — 
over $1.5 million — generated by the 
activities fee to all campus organiza-
tions recognized by student govern-
ment. 
This money includes 90 per-
cent of the money generated by the 
undergraduate student activities 
fee and 30 percent of the money 
generated by the graduate student 
activities fee. 
The JFC includes 10–15 students, 
and it is led by the Student Body Vice 
President for Finance. This year, or-
ganizations had to submit their pro-
posed budget for the next ?scal year, 
which includes the fall 2015 and 
spring 2016 semesters, to the JFC by 
Jan. 23. According to the schedule 
on its website, JFC planned to re-
lease preliminary budgets for every 
organization on April 1.
 In the following week, it was 
originally announced that organiza-
tions could submit appeals for the 
proposed budgets. However, the JFC 
did not release preliminary budgets 
until April 7, almost a week after the 
proposed date.
Last week, student organization 
leaders met with their respective as-
signed JFC representatives as part 
of the appeals process, leading up 
to the Undergraduate Student Sen-
ate and Graduate Student Assembly 
joint budget rati?cation meeting this 
Thursday.
The JFC plays an important role 
on Carnegie Mellon’s campus; its 
budget decisions shape the upcom-
ing ?scal year for every JFC-recog-
nized student organization. This 
year, the JFC process has frustrated 
many with its inef?ciency and lack of 
transparency. 
Because budgets came out a week 
later than planned, student lead-
ers and members of the JFC had to 
rush through the appeals process the 
week of Carnival.
For the ?rst time, organization 
leaders cannot view the rationale for 
the budgets of other organizations, 
cutting out a crucial aspect of what 
should be a transparent budgeting 
process. 
Although this may be a result of 
the JFC’s new online budgeting sys-
tem, Campus Labs Budgeting Sys-
tem, it has made this year’s budget-
ing process more dif?cult for many. 
The new system itself is confusing, 
compounding other dif?culties in 
the budgeting process. The Tartan 
wishes that the JFC accounted more 
for possible roadblocks when switch-
ing to a new system from the previ-
ous budget tracker.
Although the JFC and SBVPF work 
hard with the money raised from the 
student activities fee to make fair 
budgets for every organization, the 
reasoning behind their decisions can 
be murky for student organization 
leaders. A clearer enumeration of this 
year’s changes to budge metrics could 
have been provided.
SBVPF-elect and junior math-
ematical sciences and economics 
double major Benjamin Zhang wrote 
in his election platform that he plans 
to increase student involvement 
and transparency in the budgeting 
process. The Tartan hopes that he 
follows up on these promises in the 
upcoming academic year to make 
the JFC process simpler and more 
streamlined for everyone involved.

Stabbing reported at Franklin Re-
gional High School near Pittsburgh, 
Pa: I was on the treadmill when I got 
the CNN alert a year ago from last 
Thursday. I nearly fell off the ma-
chine. 
The last thing that I was expect-
ing on that beautiful spring morning 
was to wake up to the chance that 
my brother and sister, my cousins, 
my friends, and my teachers had 
been put into danger. It was the day 
before Carnival, and a school stab-
bing was not on the schedule, or even 
within the realm of possibility in 
my small, socio-economically stable 
high school. Absurdly, I wondered if 
I would have to skip Carnival.
As I struggled to understand what 
was happening, to get in contact with 
everyone I know and care about, to 
go about my last day of classes, to 
keep up with Twitter and breaking 
news, I felt like more of a stranger 
than I ever have on Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus. 
Sitting in class, I couldn’t believe 
that there was any place for normal-
cy in that day. How could all of these 
people sit around discussing the rhet-
oric of a narrative structure while I 
waited to hear how many people had 
been seriously injured in my home-
town?
My classmates didn’t even know 
the stabbing had happened, let alone 
that it had happened in the hallway 
where my sister had her ?rst class. I 
had my laptop open, refreshing the 
CNN article with live video feed, 
aware that the grad student sitting 
next to me was watching out of bore-
dom. It felt like I was in a slow-mov-
ing, high-tension episode of a soap 
opera.
Few people from my high school 
came to Carnegie Mellon with me, 
and no graduating class since I start-
ed has sent more than two or three 
students here. I was excited to seek 
out my place on a campus where 
nobody knew me, where I could re-
invent myself, where I could blend in 
with the crowd. 
But walking to class that day, I felt 
totally alone and desperate to be with 
someone, anyone, from Franklin Re-
gional. I texted my friends from high 
school who were all together at Penn 
State, watching the news together in 
pockets across campus, with anyone 
they could ?nd from Franklin.
That was what I needed. I needed 
somebody to recognize what I was 
going through — because nobody 
knew, just from looking at me, that 
my hometown was in chaos and that 
my friends and family had witnessed 
a horri?c act of violence. I was in a 
bubble, and only a few people knew 
why or how to break through it.
When I did ?nally run into one of 
those random people who came from 
Murrysville, it was as if I was meeting 
the ?rst person who spoke the same 
language that I did that day. Without 
any introduction or fanfare, we ex-
changed information: who we knew 
was okay, who we had heard wasn’t, 
and who had done this terrible thing. 
Standing outside Warner Hall, we 
hugged, then parted ways. It was a 
three-minute conversation, but it was 
my lifeline: It gave me that link, that 
connection to Murrysville and my 
school, that I needed.
Since that horrible day, a lot has 
changed. Charges have been ?led, 
the last victim was released from the 
hospital, a class has graduated, and 
another year has started fresh. There 
are still obvious scars in the commu-
nity, but Murrysville has picked up 
and kept going, everyone coming to-
gether and supporting each other in 
the process.
I’ve changed, too. Not just in the 
obvious, “hug your loved ones more 
often” way, but in the way that I root 
myself. I love Carnegie Mellon, and I 
love my community here. But on that 
day, I realized just how important it 
is to maintain a sense of belonging to 
your home, whether that be a class-
room, a sports ?eld, a store, a bagel 
deli, or your family.
Appreciating your roots isn’t just 
about loving your hometown — be-
cause many of us don’t. Rather, it’s 
about having a place to call your 
hometown. A place to look back to, 
and to fall back into, and to ground 
yourself in. It’s healthy to move for-
ward in life, but there will be no real 
growth if you don’t have a stable 
foundation from which to grow.
It took a tragedy to draw me back 
into a sense of belonging in my home-
town, my high school, and, on some 
level, my family, and that terri?es me. 
When I went home for my brother’s 
graduation, I stood proudly with my 
family as we sung the tuneless Alma 
Mater loudly and off-key. I knew then 
as I know now that I lucked out with 
Murrysville, with Franklin Regional, 
and above all, with my family.
Tragedy reminds us to embrace our roots and go home

Temporary technical failures won’t prevent SpaceX’s ascent into private space industry

Junior United States Senator 
Marco Rubio (R–FL) announced his 
candidacy for president last Mon-
day. Rubio’s announcement should 
be troubling to the left side of the 
political spectrum.
Whether it’s in 2016 or beyond, 
Rubio represents the Republican 
Party’s major advantage over Demo-
crats: young and recognizable faces. 
While former Secretary of State 
Hillary Clinton seems to be the only 
candidate from the Democrats with 
credible momentum, the Republi-
cans have a bench of ?ve legitimate 
presidential candidates and a whole 
host of faces who we may see in 
2024 and beyond already making 
names for themselves.
This development not only puts 
the Democrats in a bad position for 
the near future, but it also undercuts 
the liberal message that Republican 
politics are relics of a bygone era. It 
is hard to sell the party of new ideas 
with old faces.
Rubio, along with Senators Rand 
Paul (R–KY) and Ted Cruz (R–TX), 
is a member of a sizable bloc of the 
Republican presidential ?eld com-
prised of candidates at least ?fteen 
years younger than Clinton. How-
ever, only Rubio poses a very imme-
diate threat to Clinton’s candidacy.
Paul has alienated some of his 
father’s libertarian base by shift-
ing to the center on several issues, 
including foreign policy, and he of-
ten makes a fool of himself in public 
appearances where he can be bum-
bling or overly aggressive. Cruz is 
a shrewd politician, but ultimately 
lacks the support of both Republican 
Party voters and leadership due to 
his penchant for turning important 
political maneuvering into purity 
contests. Rubio, on the other hand, 
is a very talented orator with a fresh 
face and a knack for reaching across 
the aisle when the time calls for it, 
despite being a bit further from the 
center than most of his party.
If that sounds familiar, that’s 
because it is. Rubio’s candidacy 
will be a repeat of President Barack 
Obama’s battle for of?ce from day 
one. If Rubio can survive the crowd-
ed ?eld of Republican candidates — 
his numbers look better every day 
— he will have the exact same kind 
of appeal that crumbled Clinton’s 
attempt for the of?ce in 2008. Rubio 
has been teaching classes at Florida 
International 
University 
on the ef-
fectiveness 
of Obama’s 
campaign for 
several years now, and many of the 
tricks Obama used to pull the rug 
out from under Hillary will be in 
play next November.
Rubio is not particularly likely 
to win the Republican nomination, 
and he’s no lock to beat Clinton in 
a general election either, but he 
poses the most compelling threat 
in a mine?eld for the presumptive 
favorite. Not only is he an immedi-
ate problem for the Democrats, he 
represents a demographic change 
within politics.
Names like Rubio, Cruz, Paul, 
Representative Paul Ryan (R–WI), 
and others are already visible on 
the national stage. Rubio may not 
be keeping his Senate seat after 
the election, but plenty of people 
are right there to take his place. 
The Democrats have some serious 
rebuilding to do. Promising young 
Democrats have either been voted 
out of the picture or have drifted 
more toward state rather than na-
tional politics.
Things like the Emerging Demo-
cratic Majority — a silly proposition 
relying on cherry-picked elections 
data and completely ignoring the 
effects individual candidates have 
on independent voters — won’t 
save the party if new players don’t 
emerge from the woodwork fast. 
Hand wringing about the demise 
of the Republican Party stems from 
two faulty assumptions.
The ?rst is that Republican de-
mographics are dying out, both lit-
erally and ?guratively, and cannot 
sustain the numbers to win seats. 
This is false on two levels. Repub-
lican voters are signi?cantly more 
likely to vote in non-presidential 
elections, and split-ticket voting has 
resulted in many people voting for 
Democratic executives and Repub-
lican legislation. Holding the House 
and Senate puts the Republicans 
in a very advantageous position in 
terms of passing laws.
The second is that the Republi-
can message is outdated and unable 
to change. Republican politicians 
who are in of?ce now are going to 
be around for a long time, and many 
of them have progressive versions 
of the future that stick to Republi-
can ideals. Politicians like Ryan and 
Rubio have explicit policy platforms 
for alleviating economic inequality 
without extensive government in-
terference.
Valence voters and other voters 
who care more about candidates 
than parties are an important voter 
bloc that is often won through fa-
miliarity. Ceding that ground will 
always be dangerous. The Demo-
crats are okay but vulnerable for 
2016. Beyond there, the party better 
hope for a name like Rubio.

Rubio represents threat to future of Democrats

While female CEOs are now kept 
in high regards by most of society, 
men in “traditional women’s roles,” 
such as nurses, remain a target of 
mockery and are often looked down 
upon. Women are encouraged, much 
more than before, to try out careers 
in ?elds they genuinely like, instead 
of being pushed into stereotypical 
roles. Still, it is not close to enough.
According to a research study 
conducted recently at Univer-
sity of Washington and University 
of Maryland, Google image search 
results have a noticeable gender bias 
for certain jobs. It comes as a major 
disappointment that the Internet’s 
largest search giant conforms to gen-
der bias. When the word “nurse” is 
image searched, the results consist 
entirely of women, primarily light-
skinned. White men dominate the 
results for the word “CEO,” while the 
word “doctor” shows only 10 percent 
diversity, the majority being male, 
according to The Huf?ngton Post.
In an age where the Internet 
dominates the lives of people, having 
the world’s largest and, by far, most 
respected search giant spew out gen-
der bias is unsettling. Pictures don’t 
always form a person’s thoughts, but 
they do affect one’s subconscious, 
which is instrumental to the forma-
tion of opinions.
The most damaging aspect about 
all this is that these search results 
are far from representing the correct 
statistics. The gender imbalance on 
Google is much more profound than 
it is in actuality, according to a study 
done by Emily Cohn. According to 
the image search, only 11 percent of 
the CEOs are women, while accord-
ing to the data from the Bureau of 
Labor Statistics, 27 percent of CEOs 
are women. Same goes for job terms 
like “bartenders,” where the minor-
ity is again women, but in actuality 
60 percent of bartenders are women, 
and telemarketers, where women are 
shown as the majority, despite there 
being a 50–50 split in reality.
From here, things only get uglier. 
Cynthia Matuszek, a co-author of 
the Cohn study, says that when you 
search “female construction worker,” 
you see “A number of the top hits 
depicting women as construction 
workers are models in skimpy little 
costumes with a hard hat posing sug-
gestively on a jackhammer.”
Google image search works by 
mining the web for content based 
on algorithms that are designed to 
show you the results it thinks you’d 
most want to see, according to The 
Huf?ngton Post. Therefore, Google 
is capable of tweaking its algorithm 
to depict the actual distribution of 
gender among different jobs, but it 
chooses not to.
Imagine if these images were 
skewed the other way round, for the 
sole purpose of eradicating social 
bias. Studies have shown that gender 
biases displayed in search have a tan-
gible effect on how people perceive 
gender breakdowns in the real world. 
Google has the power to change peo-
ple’s mindsets. It comes as a shock 
as to why Google would refrain from 
representing the actual data to its us-
ers. We surely will not continue to be 
as progressive as we think we are if 
search engines continue to spew out 
skewed results.
Google could change minds by eliminating its gender bias

Benjamin Franklin famously said 
that only three things were inevita-
ble: death, taxes, and President Hill-
ary Clinton. This Sunday, Clinton 
ended over 200 years of speculation 
when she of?cially announced her 
candidacy for President of the Unit-
ed States.
To many politicos, the 2016 elec-
tion is already a done deal. Hillary 
Clinton is unstoppable. She’s going 
to easily win the entire presidential 
election, let alone the Democratic 
nomination.
Nearly a year before the ?rst pri-
mary Caucus in Iowa, many ostensi-
bly progressive organizations, media 
outlets, and groups have already 
thrown their support behind Hill-
ary Clinton. They’re already calling 
on the rest of the Democratic party 
to fall in line, and they’re attacking 
true progressives like New York City 
Mayor Bill de Blasio, who dared sug-
gest that he wanted to see Clinton’s 
“vision” before he blindly endorse 
her.
Hillary Clinton has not yet prov-
en herself as a progressive, and she 
needs to before she should have the 
unmitigated support of the Demo-
cratic party, much less its progres-
sive wing.
The problem with the rhetoric 
of inevitability is that it diminishes 
the urgency for a competitive Demo-
cratic primary that produces a truly 
progressive candidate. No candidate 
should get the party’s nomination 
simply because it’s her turn. She 
should earn the nomination by prov-
ing that she is the best candidate to 
represent and lead the party in the 
general election.
The thing about primary elec-
tions is that nobody votes in them, 
except the people that really care 
about their party’s politics. Demo-
cratic primary voters are the most 
ideologically liberal voters, and 
they’ll vote for the most ideologically 
liberal candidate. 
With so many Democrats eager 
to skip the primary altogether and 
run Clinton unopposed, the danger 
is that Clinton can slip through the 
primaries without primary voters 
verifying that she is truly progres-
sive enough to be the Democratic 
nominee.
Unfortunately, the damage may 
already have been done. Anyone 
hoping for a competitive Democratic 
primary in 2016 is probably going to 
be sorely disappointed. Most of the 
truly progressive possibilities, like 
Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massa-
chusetts and Senator Sherrod Brown 
of Ohio, have declined to run.
A few of the candidates still con-
sidering a run are Independent 
Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, 
who is a self-identi?ed Democratic 
Socialist, former Secretary of Labor 
Robert Reich, who is an outspoken 
activist on the issue of income in-
equality, and former Virginia Sena-
tor Jim Webb. The common ground 
shared by all of these candidates, 
other than being more progressive 
than Hillary Clinton, is that they are 
utterly unelectable. Even if any of 
these candidates do run, they will 
be hard pressed to impact the race 
whatsoever.
To be fair, Clinton has struck a far 
more populist, progressive tone than 
in the past. She claims that she wants 
to be the “champion of everyday 
Americans.” She has harped on how 
the “deck is stacked in favor of those 
already at the top.” She has made in-
come inequality a major theme of her 
campaign. She has voiced support 
for a Constitutional Amendment to 
reverse Citizens United, a recent Su-
preme Court decision that opened 
the ?oodgates for virtually unlimited 
corporate spending in elections. 
One of Clinton’s ?rst major cam-
paign hires was Gary Gensler, one of 
Wall Street’s most outspoken critics, 
a move that could be symbolic of an 
aggressive stance against the power-
ful corporate and ?nancial interests 
that stand opposed to the interests of 
everyday Americans.
Still, anyone who truly consid-
ers themselves a progressive should 
wait before hopping on the Hill-
ary Clinton bandwagon. We must 
demand of Hillary Clinton a truly 
progressive platform. This includes 
a hefty minimum wage increase, so 
that anyone who works full time can 
have the ability to provide for their 
family; tax increases on the wealthy 
and on corporations; an end to costly 
tax loopholes, to ?nance spending 
on infrastructure and education; 
heavy regulation of Wall Street; ag-
gressive steps to end climate change; 
and foreign policy that ends the era 
of American colonialism through 
military intervention, and instead 
recognizes negotiation and diplo-
macy as the only tools to bring about 
sustainable peace.
We can’t let Hillary Clinton be the 
centrist candidate that she’s been 
in the past. In today’s political cli-
mate, centrism isn’t the same thing 
as bipartisanism. The more Demo-
crats try to meet Republicans in the 
middle, the more the GOP will move 
to the right. This is why people think 
the Affordable Care Act, an idea ?rst 
championed by the conservative 
Heritage Foundation, is socialism.
Hillary Clinton must establish 
herself as a populist, progressive 
candidate, whose policies stand up 
for the poor and middle class and 
demand more of the wealthy and of 
corporations. That is a winning strat-
egy that will help move the country 
forward.

Strong ?eld of contenders portends exciting NBA playoffs
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Sports Editor
The NBA playoffs this year 
feature one of the deepest and 
most balanced ?elds in recent 
memory. Despite a very weak 
Eastern Conference, there are 
six teams that could reason-
ably win the title. Even teams 
without title aspirations can 
make names for themselves 
with ?rst round victories.
In the East, it comes down 
to the Cleveland Cavaliers 
and Atlanta Hawks. The other 
six teams in the conference 
are all brutally ?awed, thrust 
into the playoffs because the 
spots are reserved rather than 
earned. Many people think the 
Hawks lack the star power to 
compete with the Cavs in the 
playoffs, but the Hawks have 
nine players who can do seri-
ous damage and, as we saw 
with the Spurs last year, depth 
is incredibly important as tired 
legs falter toward the later 
rounds of the playoffs. The 
Chicago Bulls are getting star 
guard Derrick Rose back and, 
with their full cast together, 
could do some damage, but 
the Cavs have been dominant 
for a long time and will likely 
run directly over the Bulls in 
the second round, should they 
get that far.
There are some fun teams 
in the Eastern playoffs, such 
as the Boston Celtics and the 
Milwaukee Bucks, but those 
teams are fun to watch be-
cause they string together 
wins despite glaringly obvi-
ous holes, not because they’re 
well-oiled machines waiting to 
do serious damage.
If the Toronto Raptors or 
Washington Wizards can ?nd 
their early season form again, 
it’s possible that one of those 
teams could turn some heads 
in the second round against 
the Hawks, but it is unlikely 
that the winner of the round 
one series between the two 
teams will be very competitive.
The Cavaliers are heavy fa-
vorites to win the East, but the 
Hawks ought not be counted 
out. Depth matters, and cen-
ter Al Horford is a star despite 
what anyone says. He can take 
over a game and start blow-
ing up the paint, as he has in 
the past when Brooklyn Nets 
guard Joe Johnson was on the 
Hawks and they made the sec-
ond round a couple times.
Speaking of the Nets, 
they’re in the playoffs for some 
reason. Maybe it will be fun to 
watch them get eaten alive by 
the Hawks, but they’re a sym-
bol of conference imbalance 
rather than an actual factor in 
the playoffs. The NBA should 
look into a system where a 
team this bad is replaced by a 
team as good as the Oklahoma 
City Thunder, which narrowly 
missed the playoffs in the 
West, but that will not happen 
this year.
Ultimately, the Hawks are 
the best coached team in the 
playoffs. With all due respect 
to Cavaliers forward and 
four-time MVP LeBron James, 
depth often goes further than 
star power. James can abso-
lutely win a series by himself, 
even against a good team, but 
Vegas calling the Cavaliers the 
favorite seems to be undercut-
ting the top seed.
In the West, four teams — 
the Golden State Warriors, the 
Houston Rockets, the San An-
tonio Spurs, and the Los Ange-
les Clippers — are all realistic 
bets to make the ?nals. The 
Warriors have a ?rst round 
matchup against the New Or-
leans Pelicans, a team led by 
forward Anthony Davis and a 
competent if not spectacular 
supporting cast. The Warriors, 
however, are a well-oiled ma-
chine and should dispatch the 
Pelicans with little resistance.
The Rockets draw the 
Mavericks, who started the 
year off as the league’s best 
offense and then collapsed 
upon trading for guard Rajon 
Rondo. The Texas rivalries al-
ways make for great intensity, 
but it’s possible this series be-
comes a very boring parade to 
the foul line as players hack 
Rockets center Dwight How-
ard and Rondo and Rockets 
guard Harden draws fouls 
with reckless abandon.
The Clippers and Spurs 
playing is the pinnacle of how 
evil the NBA’s playoff structure 
is. Both of these teams should 
have earned the right to feast 
on weak East competition in 
the ?rst round. Even if the 
conferences are important for 
some reason, a normal seed-
ing in the West would have 
pitted the Clippers against the 
Portland Trailblazers and the 
Spurs against the Memphis 
Grizzlies, but the NBA gives 
undue rewards to divisional 
winners, which caused these 
two title contenders to meet 
in what should be an epic ?rst 
round clash featuring lots of 
star power in Clippers forward 
Blake Grif?n, guard Chris 
Paul, Spurs forward Kawhi 
Leonard, and others. Two of 
the NBA’s most storied coach-
es, the Clippers’ Doc Rivers 
and the Spurs’ Gregg Popovic 
will go at it in what could eas-
ily have been the conference 
?nals.
Led by guard Steph Curry, 
the Warriors have been the 
best NBA defense in years, and 
their offense is not far behind. 
It seems silly to bet against a 
team that has been so good 
in every respect for the whole 
season, and the Warriors 
should do serious damage in 
the playoffs.
With a deep ?eld, the NBA 
playoffs should be as excit-
ing this year as any. The small 
sample of the playoffs always 
creates some fun surprises and 
turns expectations on their 
head. This year looks like it 
will bring more of the same.

Women’s lax overcomes all
IAN TANAYA
Assistant Sports Editor
The Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s lacrosse team has had a 
tough season, but its growing 
strength is something their 
competitors in the Women’s 
Collegiate Lacrosse League 
(WCLL) should be noticing. 
The Tartans ?nished 4–4 this 
year, up from 3–5 last year. 
The team even quali?ed for 
the playoffs, although it was 
unable to compete because 
of Carnival. What should be 
noted is that the team has 
managed to do this well de-
spite trying circumstances 
that have tested its tenacity 
off the ?eld.
Sophomore mid?elder and 
team captain Melyssa Eigen 
chronicled some of the chal-
lenges the team faced during 
the season. One of the biggest 
problems had also affected 
the men’s lacrosse team: a 
very condensed schedule due 
to the snowfall over the course 
of the winter. Over the course 
of two and a half weeks, the 
team had to play all eight of 
its games with limited prac-
tice. “It was a lot of work and 
everyone was pretty tired, but 
despite all that, we all played 
pretty well,” the mechanical 
engineering and engineer-
ing and public policy double 
major said. In addition, Head 
Coach Emily Patterson moved 
to Germany near the end of 
the season, creating a lead-
ership void. “Not having a 
coach during that time was 
pretty dif?cult.” To ?ll the 
leadership void, Eigen said 
everyone stepped up to sup-
port each other. “Mostly, we 
were equals on the team, and 
we worked together to coach 
ourselves.”
Despite these circumstanc-
es, the Tartans continued 
to forge ahead against their 
competition. In their fourth 
game of the season, the team 
blew out Marshall University 
15–1. Their rematch against 
Indiana University of Pennsyl-
vania (IUP) was a particular 
high point for the team. When 
the Tartans opened up their 
season against IUP, they lost 
10–4. However, the Tartans 
got their revenge in their sec-
ond matchup, defeating the 
Crimson Hawks 9–4. “Playing 
them is always a good chal-
lenge for our team, but this 
year it was a big win and gave 
our team momentum again,” 
sophomore center Sarah Dun-
can said. 
Eigen cited Duncan along 
with centers Amelia Jones 
and Julie Wu, as some of the 
top contributors of the team. 
Though their ?nal game of 
the season was a 17–5 loss 
against the University of Pitts-
burgh, the Tartans considered 
this year quite a success, espe-
cially considering the outside 
circumstances.
Even though they couldn’t 
attend the playoffs this year, 
the team feels optimistic 
that they can do well next 
year. First-year attacker Jes-
sica Jackson in particular is 
a cause for optimism. She 
contributed a lot to the offen-
sive scores and ended up as 
the team’s MVP. “As a team, 
we were better collectively,” 
Eigen said. She cautioned, 
however, that there is still a 
lot of work for the team to get 
to the next level. “We have to 
get more time to practice be-
fore the actual season starts.” 
While she feels the pieces are 
there for a strong run next 
year, she knows that the team 
will need to be ?ring on all 
cylinders to do so. Still, it’s 
pretty clear that this team will 
become dangerous contend-
ers in the WCLL.
Track & Field
On Saturday, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
track and ?eld teams com-
peted at the Dave Labor Invita-
tional hosted by Slippery Rock 
University.
For the women, junior 
Taylor Maggiacomo ?nished 
sixth in the 3000-meter stee-
plechase, a feat made more 
impressive given she was 
the only Division III athlete 
to compete in the event. In 
the 1500-meter run, juniors 
Rekha Schnepf and Liz Snyder 
?nished ?fth and seventh with 
times of 5:01.66 and 5:06.79, 
respectively.
Sophomore Grace Yee set a 
school record in the pole vault 
by clearing the 3.21-meter bar, 
breaking the previous record 
of 3.10. The record-breaking 
?nish was good enough for 
sixth in the event.
On the men’s side, ?rst year 
Joseph Pickens won his heat of 
the 1500-meter and ?nished 
eighth overall, ?rst in Division 
III competition, with a time of 
4:16.02 with fellow ?rst year 
Ani Ramakrishnan following 
right behind with a time of 
4:18.24.
Continuing the ?rst year 
domination, ?rst-year Paul 
Fleming ?nished second in 
the 5000 meter with a time of 
16:06.75. Sophomore William 
Casazza ?nished third cross-
ing the line at the 16:10.35 
mark. Fellow sophomore 
Don Boyer set a pair of career 
highs as he placed ?fth in the 
110-meter hurdles with a time 
of 15.65 and sixth in the long 
jump with a 6.54-meter leap.
Both teams will next com-
pete in Atlanta, GA in the Uni-
versity Athletic Association 
Championships this upcoming 
weekend.
Men’s Golf
The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
golf team hosted its Spring 
Invitational on Tuesday at the 
Longue Vue Club. Sophomore 
George Qian led the Tartans 
with a 72 and tied for third 
place individually while the 
team shot a 305 and placed 
?fth. As part of the B team for 
Carnegie Mellon, which com-
peted as individuals, ?rst year 
Nikhil Mohan also tied for 
third with his score of 72.
The Tartans are in the 
midst of ?nishing their season 
at the Mercyhurst Spring Invi-
tational that ends Monday.
Women’s Golf
On Tuesday, the Carnegie 
Mellon women’s golf team 
shot a season low 326 on their 
way to a ?rst place ?nish in 
the Saint Vincent Invitational. 
First-years Summer Kitahara 
and Robin Tan led the way 
with a pair of 77s and tied for 
?rst overall individually. Fel-
low ?rst year Emma Hoskins 
shot a 79 and tied for third on 
the individual leader board. 
The win is the second straight 
for the Tartans and their ?fth 
of the season.
The inaugural season as 
a varsity sport for the wom-
en’s team winds to a close 
Monday at the Grove City 
Spring invitational.

After ?nishing the regular 
season with a 7–2 win against 
California University of Penn-
sylvania, the Carnegie Mellon 
women’s tennis team sealed 
their spot among the Elite 
Eight, which will allow them 
to continue onto the NCAA 
Division III Women’s Tennis 
Championship after they play 
in the University Athletics As-
sociation (UAA) Champion-
ship. While all members of 
the team are eager to compete 
in both postseason competi-
tions, they will be bittersweet 
for players like senior busi-
ness administration and sta-
tistics double major Bryn Ra-
schke. “This is the end of my 
competitive career,” she said, 
noting how she feels a bit of 
sadness at the end of a big 
part of her life, yet is also ex-
cited for what the future has 
in store.
Raschke’s ?rst foray into 
sports came when she started 
playing soccer in preschool. 
For her, the sport meant meet-
ing and interacting with a lot 
of new people who shared a 
common interest. “I’ve been 
playing sports as long as I’ve 
been in school,” she said. Dur-
ing the summers, when soc-
cer wasn’t in season, Raschke 
would watch her brother 
practice tennis, which gradu-
ally captured her interest un-
til she decided to take it up 
herself in middle school. She 
gained skill at the sport fairly 
quickly with the amount of 
she spent practicing when not 
playing soccer even compet-
ing in some tournaments. It 
wasn’t until high school, how-
ever, that her interest in ten-
nis became a passion.
“I’ve played team sports 
all my life, so it was nice to 
have tennis be a team sport 
in high school,” she said. It 
certainly didn’t hurt that the 
school’s tennis program had 
achieved a strong reputation, 
having won 21 straight sec-
tional championships by the 
time Raschke graduated. She 
specialized in being a doubles 
player, and she was the top 
doubles player in the school 
and a team captain during her 
junior and senior years.
Raschke grew a bit rest-
less with the San Diego area 
and wanted to explore the 
east coast when she went to 
college. Her primary focus 
was on academics, since she 
wasn’t sure if she wanted to 
continue playing sports dur-
ing her college years. Still, she 
expressed an interest in being 
part of a highly ranked tennis 
team. At Carnegie Mellon, Ra-
schke felt like she was check-
ing off both boxes.
Although she initially had 
some troubles adjusting to 
the new demands of college 
courses, she felt like she was 
prepared to balance academ-
ics and athletics. “Balancing 
sports and academics has 
been something I’ve been do-
ing my whole life,” Raschke 
said.
Raschke is most proud of 
how the team has changed 
over the course of her college 
career. “We made the Elite 
Eight ?rst year and senior 
year, but it’s such a different 
experience and atmosphere 
than it was back then,” she 
said. Over the past four years, 
she feels like the team dy-
namic has grown consider-
ably stronger. “We’re more 
of a team now … as much as 
any other team sport at CMU. 
Everyone wants to see each 
other and hang out even out-
side of practice.”
One indicator of this, Ra-
schke said, is how she feels 
like she can play doubles with 
anyone on the team. “I’ve had 
lots of partners at Carnegie 
Mellon. Switching up is re-
freshing, and it’s nice to know 
that I can play with all of my 
teammates.”
This type of chemistry has 
allowed the Tartans to consis-
tently succeed in past years. 
The team has ?nished in sec-
ond place at the Intercolle-
giate Tennis Association (ITA) 
Indoor Team Championship 
each of the past four years. 
The team also went from 
a fourth-place ?nish in the 
2012 UAA Championship to 
second place ?nishes in 2013 
and 2014.
Raschke believes the 
stronger team dynamic will 
help them get further into the 
playoffs this time around.
Raschke is looking for-
ward to traveling once college 
is over; she especially wants 
to watch Grand Slam tourna-
ments live. 
Although she will still play 
tennis recreationally, she also 
wants to take up new hobbies, 
as well as watch more plays 
and movies.

Milliseconds decide Buggy as SDC, CIA emerge victorious

Left: Senior mechanical engineering student Glenn Philen chases the buggy. Top Right: Senior business administration and information systems double major Jordan Kunz barely reaches the buggy to prevent a disquali?cation 
for SDC A. Bottom Right: Buggies spent most of the race neck and neck in one of the closest ?nishes in recent memory. 
NISHANT REINWAL
Staffwriter
The 96th Annual Sweep-
stakes competition had its 
?rst full two days of racing 
since 2010, and the competi-
tion more commonly known 
as Buggy had some of its best 
racing in over two decades 
with close ?nishes in the 
men’s races and surprises in 
the women’s ensuring that the 
large audience at the event 
did not go home disappointed.
SDC had comfortably won 
both the Men’s and Women’s 
races each of the last three 
years, but would not be nearly 
as dominant this time as CIA A 
and Fringe A comfortably beat 
their A team in the women’s 
race while they only won by 
less than a second against 
both SigEp A and CIA A in the 
men’s edition.
A key reason why SDC A 
maintained their position at 
the top of the men’s stand-
ings was the performance of 
Jordan Kunz, their pusher on 
hill 5. With the buggy barely 
a meter from the ?nish line, 
he managed to grab the bar a 
fraction of a second before it 
crossed the line and ensured 
that his team was not disquali-
?ed. Of course, this was after 
he ran fast enough to set a 
time of 2:12.358 to beat SigEp 
A by just 348 milliseconds. 
With CIA A also ?nishing with 
a time of 2:12.955, it was the 
?rst time in over two decades 
that the top three men’s teams 
?nished this close. PiKA A 
could have given any of these 
teams a run, but they were 
disquali?ed in the preliminary 
races for missing the bar.
This was also the ?rst time 
in thirty years that CIA won a 
race in any gender category, 
with the 1985 women’s race 
their most recent turn atop 
the standings. They have 
made large strides over the 
last year and managed, along 
with SDC A, to place in the top 
three in the men’s and wom-
en’s categories.
Fourth place in the men’s 
category went to Fringe A, 
who performed quite well in 
setting a time of 2:14:172 and 
?nishing within two seconds 
of the top 3. Spirit A, SDC 
B, Apex A, SAE A and SDC C 
rounded off the the leader-
board for the men’s categories 
as nine teams managed to ?n-
ish the race.
Eight teams managed to 
qualify for the women’s race 
and the top two were followed 
by a host of close ?nishes. SDC 
A ?nished third with a time of 
2:46.584, and were followed 
closely by PiKa A and Apex B, 
who ?nished within two sec-
onds of SDC’s time. Spirit B 
and CIA B were not far behind 
and barely had a second sepa-
rating them. SAE A rounded 
out the leaderboard for the 
women’s races.
The only team that did 
not  qualify was SigEp B, as 
the buggy spun out and also 
caused SDC C to spin, though 
they managed to complete the 
race. Besides this incident, 
there were no other crashes 
during the ?nals. There were 
a lot of passes in the chute, 
though, with two for the CIA 
B women’s buggy and one for 
the CIA A men’s buggy being 
the most memorable.
CIA’s buggy Equinox won 
the design competition, while 
Spirit’s Inviscid came in sec-
ond and Fringe’s new buggy 
Balius came third. The Chair-
man’s Choice award went 
to SigEp while Phi Delt took 
home the Spirit of Buggy 
award. The best T-shirt was 
awarded to SAE and Inviscid 
was the people’s choice for the 
best buggy.
There was a lot of excite-
ment amongst the heads of 
many buggy teams, who were 
more impressed with the 
tight competition this year as 
compared to last year. Fringe 
buggy chairman Preetam 
Amancharla said, “I think af-
ter all the fear of having both 
days rained out, to actually 
have had both in such a long 
time is a huge win for buggy. 
What excites me most is the 
1 second gap in the top 3 for 
men’s and the 2 second gap in 
the top 4. We can expect a lot 
of movement next year.”

DS celebrates anniversary
Dancers’ Symposium holds gala for 25 years of performance
This year, Dancers’ Symposium (DS), a student-run 
organization that puts on a two-act dance show each 
semester, celebrated their 25th year at Carnegie 
Mellon. To honor the occasion, DS hosted an event 
at the Porch Friday night and invited back alumni to 
celebrate with current students.
Organizers realized the anniversary was on the 
horizon last summer when an alumnus contacted 
veteran DS director Joel Goodloe, a senior vocal 
performance major. Directors have pointed at alumni 
involvement as an area where they would like the 
organization to expand.
Michelle Cho, sophomore business major and DS 
director, added that they have recently started 
an alumni database to work toward this goal and 
celebrate the anniversary. They’ve also seen an 
increase in alumni interaction with social media sites. 
Last week when the dancers put on a flash mob, the 
video received a lot of alumni attention on Facebook, 
creating more interaction and conversation. Alumni 
still continue to come back to enjoy the show every 
semester. Cho believes this is because DS positively 
impacted so many alumni’s college experiences that 
they’re excited to maintain involvement.
Another director, David Buzzell, a sophomore double 
major in electrical and computer engineering and 
music and technology, added that it was DS alumni 
who convinced him to attend Carnegie Mellon in 
the first place. Positive alumni involvement is an 
irreplaceable asset for any organization, institution, or 
school, and DS sees this value.
The flash mob last week was part of another goal 
for Dancers’ Symposium—increasing community 
interaction. Buzzell said that he wants to continue to 
expand the organization in new ways. This year they 
had 180 students audition, great progress for internal 
expansion. But externally they were looking to interact 
with campus in more ways than just performing once 
per semester. That’s why they added their flash mob 
and held the celebration during Carnival. Dancers 
would like also to hold camps and classes in the area 
so that they can contribute what they’ve learned to 
the community.
After speaking to dancers and directors alike, it 
becomes clear that Dancers’ Symposium is special 
to many members of our campus community. For 
dancers like sophomore materials science and 
engineering and biomedical engineering double 
major Sabrina Liu, it’s an opportunity to continue to 
dance once coming to Carnegie Mellon, but it’s also 
an opportunity for growth. After telling me “DS made 
me more sassy,” with a gesture that was sassy indeed, 
Liu talked about how her participation allowed her to 
meet people who helped her come out of her shell.
Goodloe also emphasized that the social aspect of 
DS makes it special. His involvement stretches back 
to his first year at Carnegie Mellon, when he just 
auditioned and performed as a dancer. After that, he 
stayed on as a director and choreographer for three 
more years. He said that it gave him a family outside 
of his major.
Ryan Sickles, sophomore information systems 
major, who only participated in DS for one semester, 
talked about the program’s value from a different 
perspective. He never danced prior to auditioning, 
but he said that it gave him such new respect for 
the dancers who do it every semester. They put in a 
significant amount of time before going to perform, 
which is difficult and deserves appreciation.
Cho, who had also never danced prior to joining 
DS, finds that one of the most special aspects of the 
organization is how accepting it is of everyone. “No 
matter where you come from, what background you 
may or may not have,” they accept dancers of any skill 
level or genre, because what brings them all together 
is that everyone has passion for what they’re doing.
Buzzell added that passion is really what keeps the 
organization moving forward. And at the party, it was 
clear that everyone there loved what they were doing. 
After everyone had finished enjoying the buffet, the 
crowd moved out onto the dance floor. Each dancer 
had their own style; some were in the center while 
some stuck toward the edge. A few were comfortable 
with aggressive hip-hop, and others just felt the beat. 
But everyone there seemed really happy to be dancing 
and to be with their friends. That’s what made the 
night special.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
As I was getting ready 
to go out and start my 
three exquisite nights 
of Carnival debauchery, 
an alien knocked on my 
door. I knew she (it?) 
was an alien because 
she had this super 
futuristic and revealing 
outfit with spiked, 
’80s-style shoulder 
pads, horns, red and 
black hair, blue cat-like 
eyes, and a red sword 
shaped like half of a 
scissor.
I think she was looking 
for a way back to her 
home planet — I didn’t 
recognize the name. 
But she was kind of 
hot, so I offered to take 
her with me to all the 
house parties over the 
weekend. She seemed 
confused, but seemed 
to think I was taking 
her where she wanted 
to go, so she agreed. 
So we got plastered, 
and stayed plastered 
all weekend. I can’t 
remember any of it.
Now I woke up, and 
she’s in bed next to me, 
and I think I slept with 
an alien, and I have no 
idea how to help her find 
her home planet, and 
I’m afraid she’ll kill me 
with that weird sword 
she’s been carrying 
everywhere. What do I 
do?
Fretfully,
Lackadaisically 
Adventurous, Drenched 
Yonder Khakis In Liquor, 
Laughably Lacking 
Aptitude
Dear LADY KILL-LA,
While the existence of 
extraterrestrial life forms, 
sentient or otherwise, is 
entirely likely, I highly doubt 
that a pretty one showed 
up on your doorstep, 
knew English, and imbibed 
substances that could very 
well be toxic — well, more 
toxic — to her alien body 
than to that of a human.
I posit a more realistic 
scenario: Your alien 
was, in fact, a woman 
cosplaying Ryuko Matoi, 
the protagonist from the 
semi-popular anime Kill 
la Kill. This year, Carnival 
weekend coincides with 
Tekkoshokon, the anime 
convention in Downtown; 
your alien is probably as 
stupid as you are, and got 
off the bus way before she 
should have. That scissor 
sword was probably very, 
very plastic.
So, if you two did sleep 
together, I would stop 
worrying about the 
repercussions of sleeping 
with an alien, and start 
worrying about whether or 
not you used a condom.
Or just plan a drive-thru 
wedding,
Evan Kahn

In only its third year, the Shot for Shot student ?lm 
festival is still young enough that each year the program 
gets notably better. This year, the event nearly ?lled the 
Cohon University Center’s McConomy Auditorium to 
capacity with students, faculty, family, and community, 
and delivered quality short ?lms. Some relied on 
overplayed subject matter, but many were fresh and 
entertaining.
These ?lms aren’t your sixth-grade movie projects 
shot with a Best Buy-bought video camera. They’re 
professional creations, made with professional 
equipment by near-professionals themselves. It’s clear 
these student ?lmmakers take themselves, and their 
work, very seriously.
The ?lm Steel Town won the Audience Award, 
determined by viewer-submitted paper ballots after the 
program, while Milkman took home the Grand Jury Prize 
and Marcus Sunshine snagged the Special Jury Prize.
All Sight
Directed by Talia Levin
The festival opener asks, “What happens when our 
desire to live in the past overwhelms our motivation to 
live in the present?” A grieving widower spends his time 
in a virtual video game reality in which his wife is still 
alive, meanwhile neglecting his young daughter. Though 
it ends sweetly, it’s a heartbreaking story that, despite 
the science ?ction, isn’t too far from reality.
The Colourful Mind
Directed by Bethany Barich
Young painter Gracie Winters lives in a literally black-
and-white world, chased by an oppressive government 
determined to quash individual expression. It’s 
beautifully shot, the black-and-white lens creating a 
story in light and shadows. But the trope of expression-
versus-government, complete with a central artist 
martyr, has been done before, and this ?lm’s arc is hard 
to distinguish from all the rest.
Table For Two
Directed by Connor Yoho
Three masked men break into a Pittsburgh home. 
Meanwhile, a couple bickers in a nearby park, their 
relationship on the verge of breakup. The stories seem 
entirely disparate until they’re not. What looks like a 
crime in progress isn’t what we expect. While other 
?lms trudge through serious material, this one had the 
audience laughing throughout, in anticipation of the 
hilarious ending twist.
Diamonds in the Rough
Directed by Dominique Carino
A little-known secret of downtown Pittsburgh, the Helfer 
family sets diamonds and toils over custom rings at 
their private jewelry shop. But life isn’t all gemstones 
and sparkles — far from it, especially for heir apparent 
David Helfer, who struggles to follow his father Ira’s 
footsteps. Diamonds seems to stray too far down the 
family dynamics track, leaving us there at the end, 
without rounding out the narrative. Still, it’s a poignant 
interview-based story, coarse and grounded like the city 
it’s set in.
Muted
Directed by Lex Truss
A frustrated young woman crumples up her written 
work, tossing the pages in a dingy dumpster in a rainy 
alley. Meanwhile, a ragged, bearded man digs up the 
pages, piecing them back together. When they meet, 
we see a touching exchange between two disparate 
characters. The effect is sweet, but the situation seems a 
bit contrived.
Milkman
Directed by Garrett Kennell
Milkman is a standout for its sheer whimsicality, both in 
photography and plot development. The titular character 
is also a jolly caricature of himself, in a pristinely 
suburban neighborhood that is a caricature of itself. 
When a tragic accident occurs, the milkman springs into 
action, triggering a hysterical series of events. Spotted 
with fanciful humor, this ?lm is probably the most 
perfectly executed.
Pick Your Poison
Directed by Ashley Czernienski-Hagan
Constant miscommunication plagues star-crossed 
students Parker and Julie. The story is convoluted, with 
the poison metaphor somewhat lost on the audience 
— but on a scene-by-scene level, the writing is strong. 
Spiced with lines like, “ ‘How do you feel about sushi?’ 
‘Not as strongly as I feel about Indian,’ ” the script adds 
clever punches of color. 
Rust Belt
Directed by Daniel Kusbit
Devoid of characters, dialogue, or plot, this three-
minute ?lm is primarily an aesthetic experience, pairing 
shots of rusting Pittsburgh bridges with free-?owing 
instrumental music. It experiments with geometry and 
movement, layering frames atop each other in dogged 
search of beauty, transforming these mundane, decaying 
structures into things of loveliness.
Marcus Sunshine
Directed by Marlee M. Schneider
A reformed drug dealer turned stripper gets a 
compassionate portrait in this award-winning ?lm. The 
treatment is gritty — it’s probably the least polished of all 
the ?lms — but respectful, humanizing our hero Marcus 
Sunshine in tender scenes with his twin sister. The 
?lmmakers include a moment of graphic nudity, but it’s 
an important decision to trade comfort for relevance, and 
thanks to beautiful ?lmmaking, the scene lends an odd 
majesty to Marcus’s work. Perhaps the best ?lm overall.
Steel Town
Directed by Nicolas Hurt
In 1892 Homestead, a power struggle arises between 
underpaid steel mill workers and the robber-baron mill 
owners. Based on real events, this ?lm condenses a 
historical epic into 20 minutes. Though impressive on 
many levels — detailed, period-appropriate costumes and 
a large cast — Steel Town takes itself a bit too seriously. 
It’s dif?cult to present a classic trope — hardworking, 
struggling laborers against wealthy Gilded Age tyrants — 
as new, and Steel Town almost gets there.

Audiences ponder the future of their friendships
Scotch’n’Soda’s Merrily We Roll Along raises interesting questions despite weaknesses
This weekend, Carnegie Mellon Carnival attendees 
had the opportunity to see this year’s Scotch’n’Soda 
Carnival slot musical Merrily We Roll Along. A 
work of pure genius from Stephen Sondheim and 
George Furth, Merrily explores the progression 
of a friendship among three people in reverse 
chronological order. There are many reasons Merrily 
is one of my favorite musicals, if not my favorite. 
Not only does it expertly examine friendship 
withstanding — or not withstanding — the test of 
time after college and throughout life, but it follows 
the creative partnership between composer and 
lyricist through music written by one of the masters 
himself.
I attended the 11 p.m. show on Saturday night. 
It was the last night of Carnival, right after the 
concert, when campus was full of revelers and those 
with just a little too much enthusiasm. The show 
definitely reflected that. Though giggling, heckling, 
and whooping abounded, the performers managed 
to stay in character as much as possible and pull off 
a relatively cohesive performance. The three friends 
— Frank, Charley, and Mary — have incredibly 
complicated relationships, and following them 
backward through time has the potential to be very 
confusing.
Frank, played by sophomore vocal performance major 
Angelo Ragghianti, is a very successful composer at 
the beginning of the musical, (which is technically 
the end, chronologically.) His relationship with 
Charley, played by junior vocal performance major 
Camilo Estrada, has been fractured by Frank’s more 
commercial aspirations coming at the expense of 
his collaboration with his lyricist friend. First-year 
directing major Burke Louis portrayed the somewhat 
hapless and disillusioned Mary. At the beginning 
of the musical Mary yells at Frank, effectively 
disintegrating their friendship in much the same way 
that his friendship with Charley has disintegrated. 
Mary is a drunk, and teeters around the stage 
bemoaning the end of the trio’s age old relationship.
The musical proceeds in a slightly happier direction 
after that. Audiences see Frank and Charley’s falling 
out more closely, the dissolution of Frank’s first 
marriage as a result of an affair, Frank and Charley’s 
brief but unhappy success, Mary’s rise as successful 
author, Frank and Charley’s struggles to make it in 
the world of theater as college graduates, and lastly 
the evening the three of them met.
As a person who knows the musical well, I might 
have had an easier time than most following the 
storyline through the years. Both Ragghianti 
and Estrada’s voices carried well and gracefully 
performed Sondheim’s complicated and rapid 
musical numbers. Estrada executed “Franklin 
Shepard, Inc.” — in which Charlie blows up at Frank 
on national TV — practically perfectly.
The pit orchestra also performed the notoriously 
tricky repertoire with grace. Led by sophomore 
composition major Andrew Dewey, the various 
musicians sounded clean and together, even through 
some of the stickier spots onstage. Sophomore 
saxophone performance major Laurel Beatty even 
managed to make cool and on tempo typewriter 
sound effects for the song “Opening Doors.”
Though the production had a variety of strengths, 
there were some areas that were a little less 
enjoyable. The Saturday night show probably 
had some discrepancies with the rest of the 
performances, but some of the problems were 
probably consistent over the course of the run. There 
was very little choreography during the production, 
which is partly the nature of the musical, but it also 
would have been nice to see some variety onstage. 
The ensemble often looked a little awkward and still 
during the transition numbers. Even having a couple 
dancers onstage in addition to the vocal chorus 
might have livened up some of the staging and given 
the audience much-needed visual stimulation.
The chemistry between the three leads was also a 
little off. As an audience member I didn’t find their 
friendship that believable, and I found that it gave 
the musical less integrity, because I didn’t feel as 
emotionally invested in their relationship. Part of this 
issue was due to strange staging. Because of this, 
some of the more emotional lines of the musical came 
out a little cliché, rather than as heartwarming or 
tragic as they are supposed to sound.
At the end of the day, the extensive effort expended 
by those in the production was met with enthusiastic 
applause. Though the production might not have 
had the more seamless execution of past Carnival 
slot musicals, the thought-provoking nature of 
the musical left audiences considering their past 
and present friendships and the way time and 
circumstance has, and will, change them. This 
Carnival, Merrily We Roll Along still had the capacity 
to evoke these thoughts in those in attendance, and 
that is no small feat.

6concert
pillbox 04.20.15
Carnegie Mellon students, bogged down for long 
semesters by the pressures of being Carnegie Mellon 
students, are known to leave their responsibilities 
in the classroom and party hard enough to turn any 
parent red for that one special extra long weekend 
every year: Spring Carnival. This year, nowhere was 
this more true than at Saturday night’s Matt and Kim 
concert. People danced wildly, sang, and screamed 
their lungs hoarse. People got on each other’s 
shoulders and crowd surfed all evening long. By the 
end, the concert felt like an intimate outdoor music 
festival.
The evening started at around 7:30 p.m. with 
opening act RJD2, a DJ from Philadelphia who works 
in what he likes to call “Psychedelic Soul.” For his 
set, he combined a mixture of jazz, trip hop, and 
dance to gradually build the crowd’s anticipation 
for the main act. Even though he started reasonably 
early with a thin crowd, he built his set perfectly 
to slowly warm everyone up, and was a good 
complement to what was about to come. By the time 
Matt and Kim stepped on stage, the crowd was well 
primed for what came next.
Matt Johnson and Kim Schifino are an archetype 
of atypicality if there ever was one. She plays 
the drums, and he sings and plays the keyboard. 
And even with, or perhaps because of, this sparse 
arrangement, they make big, loud, stadium-sized 
music designed to get maximum hands in the air. 
And even though they write at the intersection 
of pop and dance, their music is unabashedly 
independent and veers away from anything you 
might find on the airwaves. More than anything else 
though, they have a reputation for playing high-
powered, in-your-face shows. At Carnegie Mellon, 
Matt and Kim more than met the craziness levels that 
they are known for.
Matt introduced Kim as she walked on stage as “his 
partner in crime, and in sex.” This introduction was 
just the first in a string of hilariously over-the-top 
antics that set the mood for the rest of the evening. 
The energy emanating from the two was stunning. 
One song in, Matt mentioned that Carnival was 
the duo’s first outdoor concert of 2015, and that the 
heavenly weather was a sign that the evening was 
going to be a lot of fun. With that sentiment, they 
continued their set. Kim often jumped on top of her 
drum set to dance while she played. Matt sang his 
lungs out, moving all over the stage, dancing and 
playing the keyboard all the same.
The duo used an unbelievably wide assortment of 
tricks to keep everyone engaged. For one song, they 
threw 400 unfilled balloons into the audience. Soon 
enough, the entire sky was patched with neon, and 
the already packed ground was full of people jumping 
to catch the balloons. For a ballad, Matt and Kim 
ordered the shorter people in the crowd to to climb 
on of the shoulders of others, and wave their hands 
in the air. For another song, Kim walked off the stage, 
onto the audience’s hands to dance. All the while, a 
massive screen continuously filmed the audience.
One set and one encore later, most people looked 
like they had just emerged from a night club — 
exhausted, grimy, and sweaty, but utterly satiated. 
They left the Mall strewed with confetti and popped 
balloons, Matt and Kim’s distinctive mark on the 
campus. This week, most students will go back 
to a regular work schedule. As a break before the 
final three weeks of the semester, the Matt and 
Kim concert was an excellent chance to experience 
the frivolous things in life that we so often miss at 
Carnegie Mellon.

comedy
pillbox 04.20.157
“Who here likes robots?” Silicon Valley actors Thomas 
Middleditch and Kumail Nanjiani asked the crowd as 
they opened their comedy show on Midway Thursday 
night. To no one’s surprise, the crowd’s enthusiasm 
was overwhelming. Nanjiani even stated, “that was the 
most aggressive response I’ve ever heard to robots.” 
Middleditch and Nanjiani’s sets were very standard, 
but, like Nanjiani’s mother said of his Amazon stand-up 
special, “none of the jokes were very dry.”
The comedians took the standard route of self-
deprecation, mostly pertaining to their nerdiness. Hitting 
home with an audience that celebrates its school’s 
traditions of playing Quidditch and weird Carnival 
activities, Middleditch and Nanjiani ?t in just ?ne among 
the Carnegie Mellon populace.
The two opened together, and within a few minutes, 
Nanjiani introduced Middleditch, who took the stage 
solo for about 30 laughter-?lled minutes. The laughs 
weren’t continuous, though, as Middleditch supplied 
the crowd with plenty of awkwardness — his vulgar 
jokes were, perhaps, a little extreme for some students. 
After trying to set up a single girl and guy in the crowd, 
Middleditch recounted his high school experience, his 
brief college years, and a near death experience.
“Thomas Steven Middleditch: I always felt like my name 
belonged in an old English novel. Like I’d be the boy 
asking ‘Please sir, can you spare a bit more soup?’ and 
he’d reply ‘No, you rat bastard. Steven — stop touching 
your penis.’”
Middleditch sometimes invoked his father’s British and 
Severus Snape-like mannerisms in his set. He proceeded 
to then tell the story of his near-death experience at the 
hands of the Paci?c Ocean in Australia. When talking 
about death, Middleditch maintained a level of hilarity 
unparalleled by most comedians, making this one of the 
best Carnival comedy shows in years.
Middleditch and Nanjiani have been fellow comedians 
and friends for over ten years. After they both started 
their careers in Chicago, the pair were elated to ?nd 
that they and many of their friends were cast on HBO’s 
Silicon Valley, which airs every Sunday on HBO following 
the hit drama Game of Thrones.
Nanjiani is a ?tting actor for the role of Dinesh on Silicon 
Valley. He is a Pakistani self-identi?ed nerd from Karachi, 
who majored in computer science in college. He opened, 
as he usually does at his comedy shows, with his 
heritage, discussing his parents’ idiosyncrasies and his 
own. A remarkable thing happened, though, as Nanjiani 
met another Kumail in the crowd who was also from 
Pakistan. Telling the crowd “You can all leave — Kumail 
and I are going to have a conversation,” Nanjiani began 
to use this fellow Kumail’s similarities as improvised 
material for his stand-up. His stage presence was 
very comfortable, and his big laughs were executed to 
perfection.
It was at this time that then Nanjiani brought 
Middleditch back on stage, and they closed the show 
just as they had opened it: together. They further 
discussed their nerdiness, still prime material with 
Carnegie Mellon students late into the night, and they 
made a plug for their show. A competition sprung 
up within the crowd, proctored by Middleditch and 
Nanjiani. There were three blu-ray discs of Silicon Valley, 
and hundreds of students. After many students made 
remarks as to why they should get the discs, the two 
threw them into the crowd, with Nanjiani remarking “are 
you seeing these throws, man? I’m on a roll tonight!”
As the evening drew to a close, it was clear that both 
of them were on a roll. The student crowd left satis?ed 
and in good spirits. The two are a pair worthy of 
recommendation for any standup viewers.

If you stepped onto Midway during this year’s 101st Spring 
Carnival celebration, you may have noticed some familiar faces 
— no, not the faces of peers or fellow alumni, but the faces that 
appeared in some of your favorite books.
This year’s Booth theme, Living Library, brought some of the 
most prominent books of the past and present to life on a Midway 
that seemed particularly polished. Despite a few hitches, like 
the failure of Delta Gamma and Alpha Chi Omega to open their 
Jumanji and The Twelve Dancing Princesses booths, respectively, 
it was delightful to see old classics like the Berenstain Bears and 
newer books like Life of Pi brought off the page and put onto the 
pavement of the Morewood Parking Lot.
Every year, the Carnival Committee examines the booths from 
top to bottom to determine which are the best of the best. This 
year, the committee awarded first place in the fraternity and 
sorority categories to Alpha Epsilon Pi for their Jurassic Park 
booth and Kappa Alpha Theta for their Wonderful Wizard of Oz 
booth, respectively. For blitz booths, the committee awarded 
first place to the Mellon College of Science for their The Hunger 
Games booth. For independent booths, the committee awarded 
the Taiwanese Students Assocation’s Life of Pi booth with first 
place.
The Tartan similarly takes a look at every nook and cranny of the 
booths to determine which are the most successful, as well as 
which booths were most underrated. This year, we award our 
third annual Boothy Awards in what were, although not necessar-
ily category winners, some of the best booths this year.
The Architecture Boothy for Best Design
Kappa Alpha Theta takes this boothy for their unique staircase 
leading up to the second story that replicated a tornado with a 
grayscale theme to match the aesthetics of the Wonderful Wizard 
of Oz’s movie counterpart. The kitchen from Kansas at the begin-
ning of the booth was also quaint and cozy, while the staircase 
leading down from the second story was impressive with its 
flying monkey at the base that looked as if it was taken straight 
from the movie.
In a close second, Delta Tau Delta’s Journey to the Center of the 
Earth booth had a similarly impressive staircase that replicated 
the feeling of walking into the depth’s of the Earth’s many layers. 
The loud, crushing sounds that reverberated around the staircase 
and a special mirror illusion added to the effect of walking into a 
never-ending space.
The Pong Boothy for Best Game
Phi Delta Theta’s Oculus Rift game at their Twenty Thousand 
Leagues Under the Sea booth went above and beyond to deliver 
a unique experience to the user. Guests put the virtual reality 
headset on and then proceeded to shoot the giant squid from the 
book out of the water to save the Nautilus submarine. The game 
was not only immersive, but generally seamless and fun to play.
Other game, like the Singapore Students’ Association’s The Little 
Prince game, were right up there with Phi Delta’s. The game 
had two users interact with a touchscreen to dig up plants that 
popped up on the screen. However, Phi Delta’s booth took the 
cake with its game’s impressive scope.
The Andy Warhol Boothy for Best Art
The TSA incorporated impressive art into their Life of Pi booth. 
Not only did they place an elaborate mural on the outside of their 
building that gave the whole structure an ancient feel, but they 
also constructed a number of paper mâché animals that visitors 
could interact with. Among the animals were the book’s iconic 
tiger in the equally iconic raft, a peacock, and a zebra. The art, 
both inside and outside, of this book captured the essence of the 
book perfectly.
The Boothy for Most Family-Friendly Booth
The Asian Students Association (ASA) takes this award with 
their Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs book. Of course, the 
theme of this booth automatically lends itself to a family-friendly 
atmosphere. 
But ASA followed through with a fun fishing game for the kids. A 
stream pushed wooden food through the game’s area. Players had 
to use a magnetic fishing rod to get the food. Overall, the booth 
had a light-hearted feel that had the potential to keep kids hang-
ing around for much longer than they would at some of the more 
serious booths, like Student Dormitory Council’s Nineteen Eighty-
Four and Fringe’s Sherlock Holmes booths.
The Andrew Carnegie Boothy for Best Overall Booth
The Tartan’s favorite booth overall was Alpha Epsilon Pi’s Jurassic 
Park. All components of this booth were put together well, con-
tributing to a structure with solid features all around. Not only 
was the game, which involved a gun and dinosaur targets, fun, 
but there were other impressive features like museum artifacts 
that contributed to a learning experience. 
The fraternity’s largest “Wow” factor was the real Jeep sitting at 
the bottom of the booth on the way out. The room containing the 
Jeep was a great place for photographs and, come on, there was 
a Jeep in a booth! For all these reasons, Alpha Epsilon Phi’s booth 
squeezed out this best-of-booths award.
Conclusion
While the 100th Spring Carnival had some of the best booths The 
Tartan has seen to date, this year’s booths were able to compete 
with the booths created for last year’s milestone event. The Living 
Library theme is, of course, a dream for avid literary fans like the 
members of The Tartan’s staff. 
However, theme aside, the booths this year were elaborate with 
some unique structural designs, the likes of which are rarely seen. 
Games were particularly enjoyable and the intricacy of the art 
adorning booth walls lived up to previous years.
This year, it showed once again that Carnegie Mellon’s students 
have their hearts in this Spring Carnival main event. Here’s to 
many more years of booth, although next year will most likely see 
booths constructed not on the Morewood Parking Lot, but in the 
lot next to the College of Fine Arts. 
Will those booths live up to the ones constructed in the Morewood 
lot despite the possible logistical challenges of adapting to a new 
booth location? Time will tell, and the fourth annual Boothy 
Awards will be here to dissect those structures.
