Vol. 69, No. 26C-MUFRIDAY, JANUARY 16, 1970
Senator Strom Thurmond 
To Give Lecture Tuesday
Farmer. Lawyer. School teacher. Athletic coach. 
School superintendent. State senator. Judge. Gover­
nor. United States Senator from South Carolina. 
Presidential candidate. Strom Thurmond, the man 
who has held all of these posts, will be speaking to a 
C-MU audience Tuesday, Jan. 20. at 11:30 a.m. in 
the Skibo ballroom. His lecture is being sponsored 
by the Activities Board.
The Senator is noted for his history-making pre­
dictions and achievements, his independence, ad­
herence to Constitutional principles, economy in 
government, and his strong support of military pre­
paredness.
He was elected to the United States Senate in 
1954 in a write-in campaign—the first person ever 
elected to a major office in this country by this 
method. He was re-elected twice as a Democrat and 
once as a Republican. He currently serves on the 
Armed Services Judiciary and Defense Appropria­
tion Committees in the Senate.
In 1957, he delivered the longest speech ever 
made in the U.S. Senate (24 hours, 18 minutes). It 
was in defense of jury trials.
In 1961, he coined the phrase “no-win” foreign 
policy, and warned that such a policy is based on the 
fallacious notion that Communist leaders are soft­
ening.
In January, 1962, he warned that Soviet missies 
were in Cuba, nearly a year before the Administra­
tion took action; in 1963, he warned the Senate that 
Russia was developing an anti-ballistic missle de­
fense system four years before the Administration 
authorized our own ABM; in 1965, he predicted that 
the Civil Rights movement would be distorted by 
militant extremists, causing widespread riots and 
insurrection.
A veteran of World War II and a Major General 
in the U.S. Army Reserve, Senator Thurmond has 
been awarded 17 decocations, medals and awards, 
including the Legioir^f Merit, Bronze Star with “V,” 
Purple Heart, and French Croix de Guerre.

To Go Into 
High Schools
The C-MU Students for Peace 
are organizing student and faculty 
to go into area high schools and 
communities (by invitation) to 
present programs and lead dis­
cussions on national issues. We 
don’t have enough bodies at this 
time to fulfill our obligations and 
to expand the program. If you feel 
at all competent in the areas of 
“ the war, draft, military, woman's 
role or the women's liberation 
movement, “new morality.” pov­

campus unrest or other areas of 
concern—volunteer!
The format for these programs 
is completely flexible and will de­
pend on the desires of the group 
making the request. A lot of the 
opportunities will probably be 
small group settings, with stu­
dents and faculty as discussion 
group leaders. The larger the pool 
to draw from, the more flexibility 
the project can have!

Fire Breaks at Scaife 
IBM Cards in Flames
Early Tuesday morning at 12:05 a fire broke out in the basement 
of Scaife Hall. The fire was discovered by the C-MU custodial staff.
Scott Tilden, director of WRCT, asked on of the custodians what 
was burning. “IBM paper and computer cards.” he replied.
The custodians reported that the fire was well under way when they 
discovered it. City fire trucks responded to the call and the fire was ex­
tinguished in less than an hour.
When asked by Tilden as to the causes of the fire, the chief re­
sponded that, “We just don't know.”
The fire chief cited damage to overhead electrical wires in the 
computer building and estimated damages at approximately four to five 
thousand dollars. David Nickerson, head of the Computation Center, 
estimated the damage to be less than ten thousand dollars.
Power was cut off in the building but was restored by 8 p.m. Tues­
day night.
Nobody was injured in the fire.

Editorial
Because of its special function and purpose, a university 
brings together members of several different generations. Some 
within the community successfully bridge what has so often been 
called the “generation gap.” Others, of course, do not. Whether 
or not a professor has been able to effectively communicate with 
his students is certainly a criteria for evaluating how good he is 
at his work.
Thus this short piece is dedicated to all our professors who 
have the desire to be good teachers, who want to maintain their 
civility, their sanity ... and most of all, to survive.
Rule Number One: Listen. If you insist upon doing all the 
talking you won’t learn much from us. And however senseless 
we may sometimes appear to be, you may be surprised at how 
much sense we can talk.
Rule Number Two: Smile. You would be surprised how of­
ten you appear glaring, sneering, frowning, or disgusted when 
you look or talk to us. Deliberately or unconsciously. We know 
when you are hostile. Hostility breeds hostility. Can Sen com­
municate with someone who is openly antoagonistic?
Rule Number Three: Level with us. We are open and hon­
est (maybe we haven’t learned the tricks of the trade?). If you 
talk to us in that spirit, you’ll find there is little, perhaps noth­
ing, we can’t talk about.
Rule Number Four: Please don’t try to be one of us. It is 
truly pathetic to see creatures over 30 who, though they may 
be unsympathetic with our views, think they will be accepted 
and part of the university “thing” if they dress, talk, act and 
look like us. Of course, there are some who honestly think and 
act like our generation. But others! Remember “do your own 
thing” is :>ne of our mottos. Translated, we will respect your be­
liefs, attitudes, and life-style if you honestly believe in them and 
stand up for them. Don’t try to be something you are not.
Rule Number Five: Share with us your own finest hopes, 
your finest purposes. Certainly idealists were no rarer in your 
generation than they are in ours. Sharing dreams is a sure-fire 
method of communication.
Rule Number Six: Believe in us. We’ll sense it if you do. 
And, eventually if not now, we’ll respond to that belief.
Rule Number Seven: Don’t ask us why we look the way we 
do. Most of us can’t even explain it to our parents. And some of 
us, don’t really even know.
Rule Number Eight: Don’t go in with the attitude that one 
day we’ll come around. Maybe we will; chances are we won’t. 
Remember that we live in a different world. Be flexible in your 
own thinking and communicate your flexibility to us.
Rule Number Nine: You have made the study of a subject 
your life’s work. It is exciting and living to you. Show us why 
and how.
Rule Number Ten: Open our minds. Don’t mold them. There 
are very few right answers in life. Ask us the right questions; 
don’t give us the “right” answers. Let us discover them for our­
selves.
Rule Number Eleven: Let us make mistakes. You did.
Think about it. These are not an infallible set of rules. But 
they just might work.

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
Results of Lottery Not In Random Sequence
Editor. ato armTrhu
The lottery was intended to ex­
pose all draft age men to the luck 
of the draw, for an impartial de­
termination of who should serve.
The results are so heavily 
weighted towards selection of 
those with birth dates in the later 
months of the year, as to question 
their impartiality. A professor of 
mathematics at N. Y. University 
has examined the figures below, 
and stated they are not random!
In the 12 months to draw from, 
it would be imagined that after 
four dozen dates were drawn, 
they would fall approximately 
four from each month. The actual 
figures were eight dates from De­
cember. only one date from Jan­
uary. November and December 
drew 13 dates. January and Feb­
ruary only three dates.
If we examine how many dates 
were drawn from each month. 
January all the way to December, 
dates drawn by month were one. 
two. three, four, five. six. seven, 
eight. In other words, there is a 
steady increase as we go later in 
the years. For numbers drawn in 
the first, second, third and fourth 
quarters of the year, the figures 
are six. ten. 15. and 17.
It is the consistency of these 
progressive results which opens 
up some thoughts as to how well 
the capsules were mixed in the 
fish bowl.
Of the first 100 dates selected. 
15 were drawn from the month of 
December, only six from January. 
Since January capsules went into 
the fish bowl first, and December 
capsules went into the bowl last, 
the conclusions are obvious.
Would it not be fairer in future 
lotteries to use 12 fish bowls, one 
for each month, and draw by a lot­
tery sequence one from each 
bowl, so that after 48 capsules are 
drawn the results would be four 
from each month, and not an eight 
to one ratio'as in the lottery just 
held? Minor adjustments could 
compensate for unmonths and 
monthly birth rates.
The same result may be accom­
plished by one fist bowl if the lot­
tery is listed in dozens. If the first 
three dates drawn were all Sep­
tember. instead of being assigned 
one. two, three, they would be as­
signed a dozen apart, that is one. 
13. 25. If the next three selec­
tions were December. June. De­
cember. they would be assigned 
two. three. 14. This would provide 
a true random sequence even if
the fish bowl were thorough’ mix­
ed.
I am sending this letter to 100 
college editors and have asked 
that each submit this letter to 
their mathematics department 
and confirm that the results of 
the recent lottery were not in ran­
dom sequence, according to the 
laws of probabilities.
When so confirmed, what cor­
rections can be made in the lot­
tery just held I leave for your con­
sideration.

Dear Mr. Rogers.
By a number of observations I 
have determined that the regis­
trar's office (or somebody) has 
decided to change the course num­
bering scheme at C-MU. begin­
ning this spring semester. I heart­
ily agree with this proposal. How­
ever. I have objections to this oc- 
curance. First, there has been no 
general announcement to the cam­
pus community about the change. 
Secondly, there was no discussion 
about the new scheme.
I have seen other university 
catalogues and attended another 
university and seen similar nur- 
bering schemes to the present pro­
posal. They also designate under­
grad courses in each department 
as numbers 100-699 depending 
on the level of presentation and 
700-999 as graduate courses. But 
they gave a two letter mneumonic 
prefix to indicate which depart­
ment a course was in instead of 
the coming scheme of a two digit 
prefix. As a computer scientist I 
feel that I know the capabilities of 
computers. They don’t have to al­
ways work with numbers. It is 
just as easy to program them to 
recognize and alphabetize letters. 
Therefore, I propose that instead 
of the first course in the Compu­
ter Science Department being 
known as 15-100, it should be Cs- 
100. Likewise, mathematics 
courses would be Ma-. etc.
I also have other gripes with 
the registrar’s office. I have been 
around C-MU both as an under­
graduate and graduate student 
and have seen a number of differ­
ent registration schemes. In mv 
opinion they have gotten worse, 
not better. It is a great conveni­
ence to both the student and reg­
istrar’s office to have some sort 
of pre-registration. Why cut it 
out? Why try to be cute on regis­
tration materials (Black or Col­
ored or Afro-American or other)? 
Why can’t we find out what 
courses are to be offered each se­
mester until registration day? At 
a university I attended each stu­
dent could obtain a published com­
plete course timetable which in­
cluded the names of the profes­
sors teaching the course before he 
had to register.
Maybe it is time that the regis­
trar’s office looked around to see 
what other universities do. Es­
pecially you might look at what 
the large universities do since 
they must tackle the problem on a 
grand scale.
I am sending a copy of this let­
ter to the editor of ato armTrhd but 
would like a personal reply. I have 
other gripes, but perhaps it is up 
to either Student Government or 
Faculty Senate to oversee the ac­
tivities of your office.

New Loaning Policies
Instituted At Libi*a i*\
Hunt Library has instituted several innovations this semester for 
the benefit of students here. Kenneth Fagerhaugh. head librarian, has 
announced that the library will extend its opening time by four hours 
on Fridays and Saturdays. Previously the library closed at 5 p.m. on 
weekends. In response to student requests, however, the library will 
be open until 11 p.m. both days. The regular staff will continue to close 
at the dinner hour, but graduate students will re-open at 7 p.m. and the 
library will be available to student use until 11 p.m. As usual, the li­
brary will open at 1 p.m. on Sundays and remain open until 12:45 a.m.
One additional photo-copy machine has been installed in the base­
ment of the library. The new five-cent machine will supplement four 
others already in operation. A Xerox machine remains in the basement, 
as well as five-cent machines on floors one. three and four.
The final innovation this semester will overhaul the present sys­
tem of loans and fines. In the past, undergraduates were permitted to 
borrow books for two weeks, with unlimited renewal privileges unless 
the books were recalled by another reader. Fines of 10c per day were 
charged for all overdue books. The new system allows a basic three- 
week loan period. At the end of this period, a reminder will be sent if 
the books are not returned, but no fine will be charged if the books are 
returned within an additional three-week grace period. In other words, 
books not recalled may be kept out for a total of six weeks without fine. 
Students will be adequately forewarned that their books are due. If they 
do not return the charged materials by the end of the grace period, 
however, a base fine of $2.10 (10c per day for 21 days) plus 25c for 
each'additional day will be charged. The new system is designed to cut 
down on payment of overdue fines by students, cut down the number of 
books "taken out” without charging, and provide students with ade­
quate time to use library materials without renewal.
Following is a brief break down of the old system and the new:
PRESENT POLICY
Basic Loan Period—Three Weeks
Renewals—Indefinite unless re­
quested by another reader.
Recalls—Material will be recall­
ed at the end of two weeks for 
another reader.
Overdue—At end of two weeks.
Fines—Ten cents per day imme­
diately following expiration of 
loan period.
NEW POLICY
Three Weeks.
None
Material will be recalled after 
three weeks if requested by an­
other reader.
At end of three weeks.
A reminder will be sent at the end 
of the three-week loan period. If 
the book is returned during the 
next three weeks after the orig­
inal due date NO fine will be 
charged. However, if the book is 
not returned within the second 
period, a base fine of $2.10 plus 
25c for each additional day will 
be charged.

INTERVIEW'S
It Ain't So 
Necessarily
by Steve Jurman
One evening early in the semes­
ter break I emerged from the 
bathroom clean shaven (with 
great physical and mental an­
guish resulting) and just in time 
to watch some official Air Force 
film on the Vietnaminzation of the 
war. The idea was that Vietna­
mese troops were not only taking 
over the ground fighting, but that 
with their brand new US jets 
they're assuming a role in the air 
war. The film started with a Viet­
namese sitting in a control tower 
with a microphone supposedly giv­
ing instructions to the planes over­
head. Then it showed the Vietna­
mese pilots doing their thing. For 
several minutes I watched jet 
planes looping and rolling and 
dropping many bombs, but not a 
single shot of a pilot. Then, after 
more shots of a lot of trees being 
blown up. I finally saw the pilot— 
a visor covered his face down to 
his oxygen mask. He might have 
been Vietnamese. Or Russian^ or 
maybe Israeli.
Why such skepticism? If our 
government says that the pilots 
are Vietnamese, shouldn't they 
be Vietnamese? At one time I 
would certainly have believed so. 
Hut that time began to end about 
fiiree years ago. Christmas 1966.
I was a junior in high school 
then and Harrison Salisbury of 
the New York Times was just 
making his tour of North Vietnam. 
He was reporting extensive dam­
age to churches, schools and other 
civilian buildings from the US 
bombing. Washington vigorously 
denied the reports and insisted 
that only military targets were be­
ing attacked. One official suggest­
ed that the damage being report­
ed by Salisbury was caused bv 
North Vietnamese anti-aircraft 
missies which were missing their 
targets and falling to earth.
Strangely enough within a few 
days the news was full of reports 
about American pilots who were 
returning from missions to tell of 
how they’d seen these missies 
falling into populated centers. It 
all fit together perfectly—too per­
fectly. A shade of distrust entered 
my innocent mind for the first 
time.
Since then many incidents have 
contributed to the well known cre­
dibility gap. Many concerned Viet­
nam. such as the infamous body 
counts, with the incredible totals 
they produced, and the most fam­
ous laundry job of all time. George 
Romney’s brainwashing (if Rom- 
ney. a governor and cabinet mem­
ber. were brainwashed, can we 
poor mortals expect less?). The 
post script to the Salisbury epi­
sode is that it is now universally 
accepted that dozens of villages 
and large civilian areas of the ma­
jor cities were leveled by the US 
bombers.
Incidents lacking credibility 
were not absent from the home 
front. The Army killed 6.400 sheep 
in a poison gas accident and then 
stoutly denied any connection to 
the affair, even after it was prov­
en that their gas was to blame. In 
a related happening the Army de­
cided to eliminate obsolete gas by 
shipping it by rail from Denver to 
New Jersey, there dumping it 
into the ocean. They announced 
that population centers would be 
bypassed—except for a few. like 
Indianapolis. Dayton, and Phila­
delphia. As I reported earlier in 
this spot, the government re­
sponse to the March on Washing­
ton was a three ring circus of in­
credibility. led by ringmaster 
John Mitchell. The President is a 
walking credibility gap. as evi­
denced by quotas like this one. ut­

topic of hunger: "You can say 
that this Administration will have 
the first far reaching attack on 
hunger in history. Use all the 
rhetoric, so long as it doesn t cost 
any money."
These few examples should 
prove that there are grounds for 
skepticism as regards the govern­
ment's veracity. They should also 
suggest why it is that the govern­
ment doctors, exaggerates, and 
outright lies.
It is simply that the government

all their personal, human failings. 
It is an inescapable fact that such 
men will lie to escape blame for 
a mistake, or distort the truth to 
make themselves look better. Just 
as Nixon will lie and distort so as 
to make his Administration ap­
pear effective and concerned (and 
hence popular and re-electablei 
so too will the general lie and dis­
tort the facts of Vietnam, so as to 
keep their jobs and be promoted.
Such is the case then. Just as 
you would not read a book without 
being aware of the author's bias, 
you must be aware of the govern­
ment's point of view when hearing 
the things it has to say.
The lampyridae beetle family. 
Delight of small boys. Biological 
light bulb. And prime source of 
raw material for another Du Pont 
innovation.
Luciferase, an enzymatic protein 
with intriguing properties, obtain­
able only from fireflies. Luciferin, 
an organic molecule also found in 
fireflies, but synthesizable. Adeno­
sine triphosphate (ATP), a common 
energy-yielding substance found in 
all living cells.
Those are the three main ingre­
dients in lampyridae’s love light. 
And because ATP is common to all 
living cells, university researchers 
discovered they could produce an
artificial glow by mixing jciferin 
and luciferase wherevei life is 
present.
Noting that phenomenon, Du Pont 
scientists and engineers went on 
to develop it into a practical ana­
lytical system. Correlating the in­
tensity of the artificial "glow” with 
the amount of ATP present in 
bacteria, they designed a means of 
measuring the reaction.
The result is the luminescence 
biometer—the first really basic im­
provement in bacteria-counting 
methods since the time of Louis 
Pasteur. Rather than waiting days 
for a culture to demonstrate growth 
density, a doctor or technician can
now get a digital readout of bacteria 
concentration in a matterof minutes.
Other potentially lifesaving uses 
for the biometer are being sug­
gested every day—such as diagnos­
ing metabolic rates, enzyme de­
ficiencies and nerve damage.
Innovation—applying the known 
to discover the unknown, inventing 
new materials and putting them to 
work, using research and engineer­
ing to create the ideas and products 
of the future—this is the venture 
Du Pont people are engaged in.
You can become one of them, 
and advance professionally in your 
chosen field. See your Du Pont

Y Supports Moratorium
Ip At a meeting of Dec. 10 the po- 
licy-making groups of the campus 
YMCA and YWCA adopted the fol­
lowing statement:
• We. the Board of Management 
of the Carnegie-Mellon University 
YMCA and the Advisory Commit­
tee of the Carnegie-Mellon Uni­
versity YWCA. affirming our in­
tention to work for rich and full 
human life and a free and just so­
ciety’ (from the University YMCA 
statement of purpose) and peace 
and justice, freedom and dignity 
for all people' (from the Universi­
ty YWCA statement of purpose), 
jointly declare that—
•1. We support the goals of the 
Vietnam Moratorium as we under- 
& stand them, namely, to promote 
the fullest discussion of the war 
and its consequences, and to be a 
voice calling for an immediate 
and uniquivocal end to the war;
•2. We support the activities of 
the Moratorium at Carnegie-Mel­
lon University and make available 
to it our counsel, assistance and 
p program activities, and
•3. We will utilize YM-YW pro­
gram activities, or create new 
ones if needed, to bring attention 
to the Vietnam war and the ques­
tion of national priorities.'"
The statement was developed 
by a committee consisting of Dr. 
^ Daniel Resnick, associate profes­
sor of history; Richard Stafford, 
assistant director of develop­
ment; the Rev. Paul Schrading.

Among the new programs which

A group of students in the 
Electrical Engineering Depart­
ment are trying to initiate plans 
for a Bachelor of Arts program 
in Electrical Engineering. This 
degree would allow greater 
flexibility and a chance for more

ities and Fine Arts. The B.A. de­

More than three years ago, the first "WE WON'T GO" statement, a declaration of intention to refuse military service in Vietnam, was circulated nationally, and 
signed by both of us. Since that time resistance to the draft (along with resistance from within the military) has shown itself to be one of the most effective 
means of opposing the war. But still the war continues with unabated fury, and still men are being drafted to fight in that war—whether by lottery or not is 
unimportant: murder and slavery are still murder and slavery, even when conducted by lottery.
We are therefore renewing the call of three years ago, keeping the original wording: we ask those who agree with it to sign it, circulate it and return it to us. 
Names of the signers will be publicized. The text of the statement is "We the undersigned men of draft age are united in our determination to refuse military 
service, and urge others of like mind to join us."PAUL GARVER, c/o CMU History Department

graduated from St. John's Uni­
versity in Collegeville. Minn., in 
1935. and received a Master of 
Arts degree from the University 
of Minnesota in 1938.
Mr. McCarthy was a teacher 
and professor for ten years. Dur­
ing the second World War. he serv­
ed as a civilian technical assistant 
in military intelligence for the 
War Department. He was acting 
head of the Sociology Depart­
ment at the College of St. Thomas 
in St. Paul at the time of his elec­
tion to Congress in 1948.
He represented Minnesota's

King Birthday, 
Now a Holiday
by John Agatson
Martin Luther King's birthday. 
Jan. 15. is now a national holiday. 
Many local high schools have chos­
en to have assemblies honoring 
King. Pitt has closed school. I 
would like to submit my own sug­
gestions on how Americans can 
honor Martin Luther King and his 
dedication to non-violence:
1. Refuse to pay war taxes (67 
per cent of your income tax and 
and all of your telephone tax).
2. If you are of draft age do not 
cooperate with the military.
3. Boycott all companies that 
have contracts with the mili­
tary. Also, boycott all compa­
nies that practice discrimina­
tion (whether it be of Blacks, 
women, homosexuals, etc.-.
4. In addition to anti-war activ­
ities join the fights and or 
start your own against other 
social ills (poverty, air. water, 
noise and traffic pollution, ali­
enation. etc.).
5. "Liberate" yourself and give 
support to other groups and in­
dividuals struggling for free­
dom. It's not just Black people 
who are oppressed, repressed 
and suppressed; it's also 
Brown, Red. and Yellow skin­
ned people, employees, em­
ployers. teachers, students, ev­
erybody. Remember that lib­
eration is not just getting the 
man or machine off your back 
but it also includes standing up 
yourself.
6. Love your enemy and yourself.
7. Do not make it a one-dav thing 
the way other national holidays 
are treated.

CMU Comeback Effort Falls Short Weds. 
In 74-67 Loss To W&J; Record Is Now 1-6
The C-MU basketball team cut a 15-point deficit to just three points in the second half of their 
game Wednesday night. But W&J, led by guard Terry Evans, came back with a scoring burst that 
sent the Presidents to a 74-67 victory.
Bob Brown led the Tartans with 24 points and Bob Grazzini contributed 12 rebounds and 
20 points to pace the Tartans, whose record is now 1-6.

The Presidents started the game by hitting their first nine shots and jumped to a 20-11 lead 
after the first ten minutes of play.
Evans and Relich were hitting a 
large percentage of their jump­
ers from the corners and the top 
of the key and W&J built their lead 
to a comfortable 41-26 score by 
halftime.
Fletcher Hardimann came off 
the bench in the second half and 
the tempo of the game suddenly 
picked up. The Tartans defense 
tightened as Hardiman and Brown 
came up with a number of timely 
steals and Grazzini begn to hit 
more often. The C-MU opening 
scoring burst of 20-9 put them 
back in the ball game since W&J 
now led by only four. Bill Weborg 
was inserted into the lineup to 
give the Tartans better strength 
off the boards and the move seem­
ed to be paying off. When Brown 
scored a bucket with six minutes 
left to play, W&J led 61-58 and 
C-MU appeared to have the mo­
mentum.
However, the Presidents re­
gained their scoring touch at this 
time and the ball refused to go'in 
for the Tartans. Bill Abraham's 
basket at the buzzer made the fin­
al score 74-67.
The Tartans hit on 37 per 
cent of their shots from the floor 
while W&J sand 50 per cent of 
their field goal attempts. The vic­
tors also collected 12 more re­
bounds than the C-MU squad. This 
win puts W&J’s record at 4-5. 
This game was originally sched­
uled to be played at W&J, how­
ever, the nee gym on the Wash­
ington campus hasn’t been com­
pleted yet. So the return match 
against W&J will be played at 
their court on March 4.
In the preliminary game, the 
Tech Junior Varsity lost to the 
Presidents’ JV. 83-74.
In case you haven't read or 
heard about the last few clashes 
by the Tartan five, here it is—Bob 
Brown, scored a career high of 
35 points but the Tartans lost their 
third straight game to St. Vin­
cent’s Bearcats, 74-70. In their
next game, C-MU shot 27 per 
cent in the first half against Ober- 
lin. They started to come back in 
the second half, however. Oberlin 
held on to win 82-73. Bill Abraham, 
with 13-14 from the charity line, 
led the Tartans with 27 points and 
Brown added 24. The Tartans 
won their fifth contest, topping 
Geneva, 71-67, thereby aveng­
ing the tough 84-83 loss that Gene­
va pinned on the Tartans last year. 
Bob Grazzini scored 22 in the 
Tartan win. Then Grove City beat 
the Tartans in a well played game 
72-63.
The team hits the road Wed­
nesday to meet Denison, then they 
return home next Saturday in the 
rematch with St. Vincent.

Jim Tomayko, a member of the 
C-MU cross-country and track 
teams, has been ranked 11th 
among the nation’s collegiate race 
walkers. The ranking was based 
on the results of the Second An­
nual Amateur Athletic Union Two- 
mile Postal Race.
Tomayko, who competes as a 
walker between racing for C-MU, 
had soundly defeated Larry James 
of Ohio Dominican College in a 
seven-mile race last month. 
James had been considered the 
best coliege-division walker in 
the tri-state area prior to the 
meet. He and Tomayko were the 
only non-California and non-East 
Coast athletes to place in the top 
15 nationally. (Those two areas 
are the centers of walking inter­
est in the U.S.)
Jim was the former holder of 
the National Junior Olympic Rec­
ord for the mile walk, satin tM8 
at eight minutes 32 seconds.
