E mm
TO PLAY FOR SCHOOL 
HONORS.
To enable a larger number of stu­
dents to participate in basketball 
games, as well as to arouse a spirit 
of friendly competition among the 
members of the various Tech frater­
nities and clubs, an inter-fraternity 
and inter-club basketball league has 
been formed. It consists of two di­
visions, one of which is made up of 
fraternity teams and the other of 
club teams. At the end of the sea­
son the winners in each division will 
meet to decide the school champion­
ship. The games are to be played 
twice a week on Tuesday and Thurs­
day afternoons from 5 to 6 o’clock, 
during which hour three contests will 
take place. All of the members of 
the various societies are eligible to 
play, with the exception of those who 
are candidates for the Varsity team. 
The management requests the teams 
to appear promptly at the scheduled 
time.
Only the schedule of the first di­
vision has been announced. It will 
be concluded before the second divis­
ion teams start playing. Each of the 
seven fraternities will meet every other 
fraternity, making twenty-one games 
in all, as follows:
Thursday, December 4th.
Tlieta Xi vs. Sigma Tau.
Xi Sigma Upsilon vs. Woodlawn 
Club.
Zeta Lambda Epsilon vs. Beta 
Theta Epsilon.

Pres. Slocum, oí (oMo College speaks on the SuDjict of Peace
On Wednesday, December 3, Presi­
dent Slocum, of Colorado College, 
visited the schools and delivered a 
talk on International Peace before the 
School of Applied Science. President 
Slocum is just returning from the 
Hague Conference to which he was a 
delegate.
President Slocum said in part:
“It is perfectly true that war is hell, 
but more than that it is moral idiocy. 
There is no reason for it. It comes 
out of the crudest conditions and is 
doing more than anything else to hin­
der the development of nations. I 
want to illustrate this by the Balkan 
war. I was a correspondent for an 
American paper during my student 
days in Germany and so became quite 
intimate with the Balkan nations’ af­
fairs. This war should have been pre­
vented by the larger European coun­
tries, but the war came on and Bul­
garia paid her price and anybody who 
has ever been to Europe can appre­
ciate the manliness of the Bulgarian 
young men. Within a few weeks 
around Adrianople, Bulgaria lost 140,-
000 men and it cost her $400.000.000. 
Servia, who could less afford the loss, 
and she lost 70.000 men and paid $260,- 
000,000. Greece lost 40,000 men and 
$120,000,000.
“War cripples our industries and 
our schools, and piles taxation on our 
country. What can ever make good 
the loss of 300.000 men? That is not 
the worst, for everything that makes 
for better civilization is set aside The 
one thing is this. Here is this enor­
mous expenditure of life and of capi­
tal, all spent on the theory of self- 
defense. The theory of self-defense 
is only a half truth, and the theory that 
government exists for self defense is 
wrong. It is for the building of the 
nation that government exists.
“Now the Hague Conference is try­
ing to do the theory that will bring 
in the better day for governments.
“Do you know what this prepara­
tion for war is costing our country? 
In 1881 we were spending $13,000,000 
per year. In 1913 we are spending 
$131,000,000 and nobody can fortell 
what the end will be.
“Have you noticed the debts of 
those European countries that keep 
great standing armies? Germany 
takes 740,000 men out of productive 
life. This is a tremendous economic 
loss and that is what the Hague Con­
ference is trying to prevent.
"The only thing that prevented 
Europe taking sides in the Balkan 
dispute, with Germany, Austria and 
probably Italy against France, Eng­
land and Russia, was the fact that 
there was not enough fodder to feed 
the horses of the great troops of cav­
alry. I heard that from reliable 
sources last year, and heard it again 
in Europe recently.
“The Hague tribunal says why can­
not we get the best court in the world 
here, have the decisions threshed out, 
and have no war. Wars are egged on 
mostly by the press. William Stead, 
the great journalist, said that if he 
could control the newspapers of the 
world, there would be no war.
“Let me say that in my own mind 
the greatest thing that has come to 
humanity is Christianity. Christianity 
is on trial, for if fighting is to domi­
nate the world, Christianity cannot 
control the world. If Christianity is 
to stand, war must go.
“It is the student, training his mind 
that is to be the saving of the nation. 
You must never break training when 
it comes to the game of life. Never 
let down. Play the game at your 
very best.
“Today as never before the world 
is looking to the United States for 
leadership. Shall it be the waste of 
great battleships and armies, or shall 
it be the intellectual leadership of 
great conceptions of justice?”
DEAN CONNELLEY SPEAKS AT sociation, at their headquarters in the
BANQUET.
Dean Connolley was one of the 
main speakers at a banquet held by 
the Master Sheet Metal Workers’ As-
Fulton Building, on Thursday even­
ing, December 4th. His theme was 
The School and its Possibilities for 
the Boy.” He illustrated his talk with 
slides of the public schools and the 
Tech shops.
WRIGHT BECOMES BAS 
KETBALL MANAGER
SCHEDULE ANNOUNCED
Because of the pressure of school 
work, E. R. McKee announced that 
he had decided to resign from the 
managership of the ’varsity basketball 
team. The Board of Control accepted 
his resignation and elected Assistant 
Manager W. F. Wright to the posi­
tion.
McKee had finished the arrange­
ment of the schedule and issued it for 
publication this week. Fourteen games 
are on the card, as it now stands, but, 
as all of these are with colleges, it is 
probable that several more with ama­
teur athletic organizations will be 
added within the next week. An 
early practice game with East Liberty 
Y. M. C. A. is one of these, and West- 
inghouse Club is sure to be scheduled 
for two games later.
The collegiate games include con­
tests with the best teams in Western 
Pennsylvania and Eastern Ohio. The 
schedule is well balanced, however, 
and half of the games will be on the 
home floor. Pittwiil open our season 
at the Field house on January 16. 
This is rather late, but the team will 
have had the advantage of a number 
of practice games, and should be in 
good shape.
The squad includes the greater part 
of last year’s team, with the addition 
of some new men that are expected 
to help make a championship team. 
Capt. Criswell, Colvin and Hines are 
traveling at a fast pace and should 
show even better work than they did 
last year. With these veterans as a 
nucleus, Carnegie has better prospects 
than ever before, so we may erpect 
a consistently winning team for the 
season.
The schedule follows:
January 16—University of Pitt, at 
home.
JaJnuary 17—Juniata College, at home. 
January 27—Geneva, at Beaver Falls. 
February 5—Marietta, at home. 
February 6—Juniata, at Huntington. 
February 7—Penn State, at State Col­
lege.
February 13—Bethany, at Bethany, 
W. Va.
February 19—Grove City, at home. 
February 20—Allegheny, at Meadville. 
February 21—University of Pitt, at 
Pitt.
March 6—Grove City, at Grove City. 
March 7—Bethany, at home.
March 13—Geneva at home.
March 14—Allegheny, at home.

A PLEASING LETTER.
Through the courtesy of Director 
Hamerschlag, we are glad to be able 
to print a letter received by him from 
Chancellor McCormick of the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh. The sentiments 
expressed in this communication we 
know will be especially pleasing to the 
students of Carnegie. Coming as it 
does from a man wTho heads a school 
with a remarkable football team, we 
can certainly appreciate the commend­
ation given our team. The letter is 
as follows:
“My dear Dr. Hamerschlag:
“I saw your boys play Haverford 
last Saturday, and enjoyed the game 
exceedingly. The second half the 
Tech boys completely outplayed their 
opponents, and the score should have 
been very much in their favor. I am 
sorry that the score as it finally came 
out so greatly misrepresented the ac­
tual playing.
“With good wishes, I am, 
“Sincerely yours,
(Signed) S. B. McCORMICK.”
SHALL WE CONTINUE FOOT­
BALL?
This seemingly momentous question 
has been occupying the attention of 
the administrative body of the school.
Last Thursday a meeting was held in 
the Director’s office to discuss the 
situation. The meeting, which was 
attended by the Director, Deans 
Leete and Connelly, Coach Marks, 
Mr. McCullough, the Executive Com­
mittee of the Board of Control, and 
others, was a most interesting one. 
However, after thorough discussion, 
the matter was left for some days 
before final decision.
Football is a good, interesting 
sport, and perhaps instils loyalty and 
spirit into the student body, especial­
ly when the team is a winning one. 
But, as The Tartan said last week, it 
is a sport in which only a few stu­
dents can participate, and only those 
few derive the real benefits of the 
game. We do not wish to belittle the 
advantages of football. Probably it 
does make for school spirit, but the 
results of the past few seasons do not 
seem to have developed an excess of 
spirit at Carnegie. On the other hand, 
the advantages of football are not 
open to all students, and only a 
very small percentage of the student 
body can derive any possible benefit 
from the sport. Also wrhen we do not 
have a winning team, which by its 
successes arouses enthusiasm' among 
the students, it seems that the bene­
fits of football are more or less doubt­
ful. It is the opinion of The Tartan 
that wTe should devote our major at­
tention to some other sport, in which 
a much larger number of students can 
participate. Take track for example. 
The money that has in the past been 
devoted to football could be well 
spent in providing facilities for exer­
cises to almost every man in school 
in track events, and we might by such 
a method obtain such an excellent 
track team that we could compete suc­
cessfully with the large schools of 
the country.
Again, if football be continued, it is 
the desire of the students that we com­
pete with schools who are in our 
class, such as Case, Stevens, Rensel- 
laer, and other technical schools. 
There can be little glory in winning 
over the small colleges which we have 
been playing during the past few 
years and if we are defeated, the dis­
grace is all the greater. It is small 
w'onder that the students show little 
interest in the football team, when the 
schedule of games is of such a char­
acter as at present.
LOYALTY.
Have the students ever realized that 
it takes a vast amount of time and 
energy to get out a college paper? 
We submit the following extract from 
the columns of the Minnesota Daily: 
“Loyalty of the Daily men is not 
of the grandstand order. When the 
reporter stays up until 4 o’clock in 
the morning to see the Daily safely 
off the press, no one applauds. And 
w'hen shortly afterward he lifts him­
self out of bed for an 8 o’clock class, 
there is no blare of bands and fren­
zied applause from assembled multi­
tudes. Few know and the others take 
it as a matter of course. In some 
way this shines as a fine example of 
college spirit and loyalty. It is anon­
ymous, and often the man who works 
the hardest never sefes his name at 
the top of the paper. Credit is too 
often given to those “higher up.” 
Some day, perhaps, the Daily will be­
come opulent enough to make some 
return for such unselfish labor, or 
with the advent of an utopian state of 
affairs in the distant future, the uni­
versity may recognize the college pa­
per as more than a toy and give grad­
uation credit for worthy efforts in the 
writing of its columns.”
It is true that we do not attempt 
here to publish a daily, nevertheless 
our path is not all roses, and we be­
lieve that a little more consideration 
and help from the student body would 
be in order. We think that the sacri­
fice which is made by the “under” men 
especially on The Tartan Staff is 
worthy of some small commendation.
A QUERY.
Every man who registers at Car­
negie pays a fee of five dollars for the 
support of student activities. Of this 
sum three dollars are turned over to 
the Athletic Association for the main­
tenance of athletics; the other two 
dollars are supposed to be given to the 
support of non-athletic activities. But 
as we all know, most of the non-ath­
letic activities are self-supporting, and 
those which are not, do not receive a 
very large amount of help from the 
Activities Committee. As many of 
the students have asked what becomes 
of the two dollars that is paid by 
every man at Carnegie, The Tartan, 
expressing as always the will of the 
student body, hereby formally asks the 
Student Activities Committee to pub­
lish in these columns a report of their 
financial standing. This should help 
to clear up any misunderstanding and 
is the best way to settle doubts which 
any students may have as to the 
proper management of their funds. If 
the money is merely being saved until 
some future time, when necessity shall 
arise for its use, then it seems to us 
unfair that the present student body 
should be taxed for the support of 
future organizations in which they 
will not be able to participate and in 
which they will not be represented.
LETTER FROM MRS. HEWLETT.
68 Remsen Street, 
Brooklyn, N. Y.
Mrs. Hewlett desires to thank, 
through Dean Leete, the Faculty and 
Students of the School of Applied 
Science for their expression of sym­
pathy on the death of her son and 
for the beautiful flowers sent by them 
as a tribute to his memory.
Nothing can be more consoling to 
her than to know that so many are 
mourning with her and that he will be 
held by them in affectionate remem­
brance.

WHAT’S WHAT AND HOW
’••»•••••••»•««»•fi..
MANNERS.
One may doubtless be a scholar 
without ever being mistaken for a 
gentleman. By the same token one 
may be an engineer and be under con­
stant quarantine from polite society. 
So-called “live wires” sometimes burn 
their insulation of civilization with an 
evolution of odors not catalogued as 
perfumes.
It is to be feared that the average 
American is too busy translating his 
energies into a bank account to con­
sider anything more elaborate than 
a contemptuous grunt, as social ex­
travagance. With the rising genera­
tion “manners” are supposed to travel 
in company with the dainty titles of 
Percy and Algernon.
Now manners do not essentially 
consist, notwithstanding popular mis­
conception, in an explosive taste for 
hectic neckwear, nor in a frank passion 
for impressimistic socks sheathing 
an aggressive shinbone left unpro­
tected by the receding limits of high- 
water “pants.” These vociferous 
charms may put every “wireless” 
within fifty miles out of commission, 
but they are not convincing proof of 
royal blood.
Nor do manners consist in a pain­
fully acquired ability to drawl 
“cawn’t” and “chawmed I’m suah,” 
without looking like a chicken thief or 
a sheep stealing dog. It is quite pos­
sible to be polite 011 a simple sched­
ule, you know, without a noticeable 
elongation of the ears.
On the other hand, to respond to an 
honest greeting from an instructor, 
say, with “how-er-you” or “hello 
there,” however cordially intoned, is 
not an essential proof of robust viril­
ity or of a substantial superiority to 
the ladylike Percy. It may be inter­
preted as the bray of an animal, name­
less in this connection, who is en­
tirely efficient in its way, but evinc­
ing a lack of early training.
It is doubtful if a student, even an 
engineering student, can afford to 
carry a “condition” in common cour­
tesy through the four years of hos­
tilities with math., mechanics, physics, 
et. al, and graduate into the riot that 
we Americans call active life, where 
discourtesy is an art, and the only 
hope for the novice is a trifle at least 
of politeness.
When you front a new Boss or the 
austere citizen to whom you are about 
to offer the job of father-in-law, with 
your tongue in a new kind of compli­
cated knot, and your mouth roofed 
with sand paper, it is comforting to 
recall that “a soft answer turns away 
wrath,” if you happen to have the 
right brand of softness with you. And 
when perchance you later descend 
the front steps in the rather difficult 
and awkward role of kickee, to exe­
cute that gymnastic with dignity, not 
only may brighten your reception by 
the pavement, but may touch the old 
man’s heart—if he has any.
And then it costs so little. In these 
days when you go to market with your 
money on a dray and return with the 
purchases in your vest pocket, that is 
a consideration not to be lightly 
sniffed at. You stand a chance to get 
something for nothing or mighty near 
it. The youth who lays claim to an 
education and exhibits the manners 
of a Siwash, need not expect the world 
to fall on his neck except with a knot­
ty club. The fact that you are cour­
teous and reasonably genial to your 
fellows, does not imply that you do 
“tatting” in secret or frequent a 
“beauty parlor.”
Bluff manners are tolerated and con­
doned when they belong to a million­
aire, but they expose a poor man to 
a sojourn in the hospital.
A little elective course in “social 
decency” will, at the end of your four 
years, form beautiful “interference” 
for your engineering wisdom.
MR. AND MRS. WM. McCONWAY 
GIVE FACULTY RECEPTION.
B. Leisser, and Judge James R. Mac- 
farlane.
On Friday evening, from eight until 
twelve, at their home, 220 Lexington 
avenue, Mr. and Mrs. Wm. MeCon- 
way gave a reception to the Faculty 
of the four Schools. The receiving 
line consisted of Mr. and Mrs Mc- 
Conway, Director and Mrs. Hamer­
schlag, Mrs. Hornbostel, and Mrs. 
Samuel Harden Church. Among ihose 
present were Judge J. H. Reed, Mr. 
Charles L. Taylor, Mr. Samuel H.

SPEAKS AT WAYNESBORO.
Prof. John T. Morris, of the School 
of Applied Industries, spoke before 
the Civic Club of Waynesboro, Pa., at 
the High School Auditorium of that 
place, on Monday evening, December 
1st. His subject was “The Education 
that is not in Books.” He spent, the 
remainder of the week in and around 
New York, visiting the various tech­
nical institutions.
Men and Their 
Christmas Shopping
To most men, Christmas shopping is a dreaded ordeal. 
Not that men are lacking in the spirit of Christmas, nor due 
to any ungenerous instincts; but that the questions of this 
season—What to give? Where to go? etc.—together with 
the thoughts of the Christmas crowds are generally too 
much for “mere man”, who leaves most of his year-round 
shopping to mother, sister or some other woman member 
of the family.
But mother and sister are on his gift list at this season, 
and so he must take up the task now himself.
This, then ,is to recommend the services of the Horne 75 
Christmas Shops all conveniently housed under one roof, 
with everything within easy reach of everything else—-even 
to our Parcel Post station on the Mezzanine floor, where 
your Christmas parcels can be despatched upon their way 
before leaving the building. Where prices are fair and 
reasonable and graded to meet all wishes, and where the 
quality of everything is above doubt or question.
We’ve done everything in our power to simplify the 
Christmas shopping problem, and make this annual duty a 
pleasure rather than a task.
The Jewelry Shop, the Book Store, the Glove and 
Handkerchief Counters, the Men’s Shop, the Toy Basement, 
the Cane and Umbrella Counters, the Fur Department and 
Furniture Floor—all have their suggestions for suitable and 
pleasing gifts for old and young.

THE CHARITY BALL.
The Charity Ball is to be given by 
the M. M. C. S. Guild on Friday, De­
cember twelfth, and it is hoped that 
everyone will attend. It is the first 
dance to which all of the four classes 
of M. M. C. S. students have been in­
vited. Alumnae are also very wel­
come.
The dancing will be in the gym­
nasium and in the lunch room, so that 
there will be ample room for all. 
Light refreshments will be served. 
The programs are very attractive and 
will be on sale on and after Wednes­
day of this week. There will be good 
music furnished by the Tech Orches­
tra, and no ‘‘ragging” will be allowed. 
Candy and school calendars will be on 
sale.
BASKETBALL.
The Basketball teams of M. M. C. S. 
have been practicing for some time 
and one game was scheduled. How­
ever, as the team did not appear on 
that day. it has been decided that if 
such a thing occurs again, basketball 
will be given up entirely.

She said in part, that when she was 
connected with the school, it was 
small and new but that she had the 
chance of becoming acquainted with 
each student in a manner which with 
the present size of the school, the 
Dean would have difficult}1, in doing. 
The work that the school is now doing 
is much in advance of that done by 
the first students, but it is really a 
working out of the first ideas dreamed 
of for the school.
Mrs. Hart said that after seeing 
this school as it is today and the ad­
vantages that the students have she 
wondered if the M. M. C. S. girls 
really appreciated all that was being 
done for them (so that they can ob­
tain an education). She spoke of the 
young women of the west who had 
a hard struggle to obtain an education 
and compared their life with that of 
our students.
Since leaving here Mrs. Hart has 
been strongly impressed with the fact 
that the training here should help 
girls fit themselves for whatever the 
future will bring. The specific train­
ing obtained in college may have little 
to do with what the girl does after­
ward, but the training here will give 
her a broad viewpoint; and should 
broaden her and so help her to make 
a successful life.
The parting message that Mrs. Hart 
desired the girls to carry away with 
t’. em was: “lTse every seed that God 
has planted in you for the develop­
ment of a beautiful womanly charac­
ter.”
THE CHRISTMAS PAGEANT.
On December 18th, the annual 
Christmas pageant will take place at 
the M. M. C. S. This pageant is very 
different from anything else ever be­
fore attempted. It will be followed by 
the Boars Head Procession, and will 
be worth while coming to see. The 
Glee Club will sing before and after 
the pageant.
The following girls are in the cast:
Keynote—Anna Thomas.
January—Marian Pritchel.
February—Marguerite Menges.
March—Anna Bromley.
April—Marguerite Diehl.
May—Mary McGrew.
May Flowers — Hazel Freeland
Ellen Cole, Anne Lachman, Mil­
dred Knapp.
June—Irene Pond.
July—Golda McClelland.
August—Dorothy Skinner.
September—Mary Wentzell.
October—Helen Harbison.
November—Louise McMillan.
December—Sara Murray.
CARNEGIE CHORAL CLUB.
The Carnegie Choral Club held its 
regular meeting in the Assembly Hal! 
of M. M. C. S. on Friday at four 
o’clock. There were forty-one people 
present and a very good rehearsal 
was held.
Practise was started on the can­
tata, “The Rose Maiden.”
The Club has decided to hold a 
social in M. M. C. S. Gym. on Mon­
day evening, December 15, at 8 
o’clock. Everyone is looking forward 
to having a good time. The commit­
tee in charge of the social is com­
posed of:
Mary L. Williams—Chairman. 
Leonora M. Honecker.
Anna O. Bromley.
R. L. Tucker.
J. Gorzo.
C. B. Kline.
HOME ECONOMICS 
DAY CELEBRATED.
The celebration of the Home Eco­
nomics Day at the M. M. C. S was 
held there for the first time on Wed­
nesday, December 3rd. The day is 
celebrated all over the country in 
commemoration of the work that Mrs. 
Richards began.
Miss Margaret Webb told of the 
life of Mrs. Richards. Miss Day 
wrote a paper on Mrs. Richards’ book, 
‘‘Eugenics,” which was read by Miss 
Anna Bromley. Miss Harrison told 
about the founding of the Home Eco­
nomics movement by Mrs. Richards, 
and the big place it now holds in that 
field. Miss Lyon, Miss Nickerson and 
M iss Hinman spoke on their personal 
relationship with Mrs. Richards.
Miss Lyon and Miss Hinman are 
both charter members of the Home 
Economics Society.
A SCHOOL FOR SERVANTS.
Columbia women are to be con­
gratulated on the start of a movement 
to solve the servant problem by edu­
cating the servants in the practical 
matters of cooking and service. At 
thé newly opened school not only may 
housewives enroll their own servants, 
but those desiring to become servants 
can obtain free instruction, with an 
open door to quick employment. If 
co-operation can be obtained, this 
modest beginning may mean, eventu­
ally, a revolution in the domestic 
economy of the city.—Columbia (S.
C.) State.
TAP THE “ETERNAL SEAS.”
The real inventor will come when 
he draws water not from the hills but 
from the sea, says a writer in the Lon­
don Chronicle. There is water enough 
for all in the oceans. It is necessary 
only to separate the salt from the 
water (and salt is supposed to be as 
wholesome as water when taken sep­
arately.) Why cannot some genius 
cut that knot between salt and water 
and tap the “eternal seas” for the 
never failing drink of water? The 
water is there in abundance, the salt 
is there in superfluity. I merely sug­
gest to some imaginative scientist
that he should make a fortune by sup­
plying the two commodities separate­
ly and cheaply.
4,000,000 PAINT PAILS A YEAR.
The increasing cost and scarcity of 
wood have influenced a number of re­
markable developments in manufac­
turing metal articles. The sheet metal 
paint pail and drum are examples One 
plant turns out some 4,000,000 of 
these each year as steel packages for 
pure white lead. They are in five 
sizes, from 12% to 100 pounds capac­
ity. Only four drawing operations 
are necessary in producing either a 
tapered pail or a cylindrical drum. 
These operations, with the accom­
panying annealing, washing, painting 
and printing, are all done by machin­
ery.—American Machinist.
One human peculiarity is to com­
plain about the “unseasonableness of 
the weather.” Isn’t the weather un­
seasonable most of the time? .
The old system of using a heated 
iron and dirty cloth presses the grime 
and dirt into your garments. Our 
sanitary machine steams it all out, and 
removes permanently the dirt, per­
spiration, odor and grime. See Shu­

The 1913-14 basketball season was 
opened here last Thursday afternoon 
when the first three games of the In­
ter-fraternity and Inter-club Basket­
ball League were played. The teams 
were evenly matched as the low scores 
indicate. Lots of spirit was shown 
by the spectators who for the most 
part were members of the contesting 
fraternities. The games were close 
and interesting.
Theta Xi caged the first victory by 
defeating Sigma Tau 15 to 9 in the 
opener. Woodlawn Club followed by 
trimming Xi Sigma Upsilon 23 to 15 
and incidentally running up the larg­
est score of the afternoon. The third 
contest resulted in a 13 to 6 victory 
for Beta Theta Epsilon over Zeta 
Lambda Epsilon. The following were

SMOKER.
NOTICE TO INDUSTRY 
STUDENTS.
It is up to the School of Applied 
Industries to put out the Thistle this 
year and that means every student 
should do all in his power to make 
this year’s book a success. One of 
the many ways you can help is to buy 
your receipt now and encourage those 
on the staff, who are working to make 
it a success and show them you take 
some interest in your school activi­
ties.
Below is a list of those who are 
selling receipts:
Upper Class—P. H. More, Monks, 
Austin, Parke.
Middle Class—Bruggaman.
Teachers’ Course—Robbins.
The Upper Class of the School of 
Applied Industries will hold their 
first smoker Friday, December 12, at 
the Fort Pitt Hotel, and the spirit they 
are showing predicts that a good time 
awaits those who are eligible.
President Carney and Secretary 
Monks have been working faithfully 
for the past week preparing this smok­
er and they claim it will be a rousing 
success.
MINSTREL SHOW AND DANCE.
The “Sox Price Minstrels,” who 
made a big hit at the recent Smoker 
held by the Plebes of the School of 
Applied Industries, have arranged for 
a performance on Tuesday evening, 
December 16th, for the benefit of the 
Student Activities, The entertain­
ment will be given at the gym. and 
will be followed by a dance. Tickets 
are now on sale for fifty cents.
A most attractive souvenir of this 
institution in the form of a calendar 
has recently been placed upon the 
student market by two of the Science 
Seniors, Wood and Culp.
Coming at this time of the year 
these 1914 calendars will make appro­
priate Christmas gifts for that one 
girl and the home folks. (Adv.)
MUSICAL CLUBS AT MARSHAL- 
SEA.
Musical Clubs on Saturday night 
journeyed to Marshalsea to entertain 
the inmates of the City poor farm.
The Clubs left the city at 4:00 P. 
M. on the Pennsy, and arrived at 5:00. 
Special car all the way. On their ar­
rival the men were treated to a sump­
tuous dinner after which they dressed 
and started for the concert hall.
The Mandolin Club started the en­
tertainment at 7:00 o’clock. The au­
dience included the poor inmates and 
the more rational of the insane pa­
tients. They seemed very much 
pleased with the music as was evi­
denced by the repeated outbursts of 
applause.
The Clubs left for the city at 9:40 
and arrived at 10 30.
The next concert is to be held Fri­
day night, December 12, at Odd Fel­
lows' hall in Hazelwood. The Young 
Men’s Bible Class of the First Pres­
byterian Church are having the Clubs 
there and they expect to start the 
concert at 8:00 P. M. For the bene­
fit of those living out Forbes street, 
take any Forbes street car, get off at 
Brady and transfer to any car going 
out Second avenue. Those who live 
in town can take the 7:15 P. M. train 
on B. & O., get off at Hazelwood, 
and walk up one block to Flowers ave­
nue to the Odd Fellows’ hall. Don’t 
forget to start early enough so that 
you may not be late.

THE INCREASED COST OF 
LIVING.
The Yale Corporation has been 
obliged to increase tuition fees at New 
Haven, owing, as President Hadley 
frankly explains, to “the increased 
cost of living.” The advances are 
moderate and the official statement is 
made that “by these changes the 
charges at Yale are made to corre­
spond much more nearly with those 
that prevail at Harvard, at Princeton, 
at Columbia, and at the Institute of 
Technology of Boston, though they 
will still be a little lower in the ma­
jority of cases.” The old and new 
schedules, to go into effect next fall, 
are:
Present. Future 
Rate Rate.
Academic ...........................$155 $160
Scientific .......................... 150 180
Graduate .......................... 100 125
Scientific, fourth and 
fifth years (gradu­
ate work) ........................ 100 125
It is just as well to see things in 
their historical relations. The prob­
lem which Yale has been grappling 
with is not a new problem.
“(Much has been heard in recent
years of the ‘high cost of living’. No 
doubt Adam, after his expulsion from 
Paradise frequently complained of the 
high cost of fig leaves.

SQUEEZING THE LOAN SHARK.
The decision of the appellate court 
in Xew York sustaining the convic­
tion and sentence of one Tolman, a 
notorious usurer, ought to have a salu­
tary effect on the sharpers who have 
made it a practice to charge exorbi­
tant interest rates against borrowers. 
It means that Tolman, who is accred­
ited with having made a fortune in 
the business, must serve six months in 
the penitentiary, instead of escaping 
on a technicality or a merely nominal 
fine.
This is the course of treatment most 
likely to break up the sordid games 
concealed beneath the cover of chari­
table motive in advancing money to 
the poor and needy. It is unfortunate 
that the benevolent organizations 
which earnestly and honestly attempt 
this work, charging the legal and rea­
sonable amount of interest, should 
be constantly brought into disrepute 
by the blacklegs wiio operate under 
high-sounding names and hide behind 
young women employes, who are gen­
erally made the “goats” when trouble 
comes.—Philadelphia Bulletin.

CRUCIBLE CLUB MEETING.
On Tuesday evening, December 2, 
the first meeting of the Crucible Club 
was held. Mr. Marcus, an old Cru­
cible Club member, gave us an inter­
esting talk on “General Mining Con­
ditions in Arizona.” His talk was 
based on personal experience and it 
gave an inside view of the mining sit­
uation from a young engineer’s stand­
point.
Mr. Marcus explained the internal 
organization of the company, as re­
gards its operating end. He told how 
the beginner started in as sampler, 
rodman or machine-helper, and if he 
stayed underground worked up to be 
shift boss. If he went into the en­
gineering works he might become as­
sistant superintendent. Mr. Marcus 
also explained the weakness of the 
system which had for its sole object 
the tonnage produced at the expense 
off the quality of the ore.
At the end of the meeting he an­
swered a number of questions relat­
ing to the mining and metallurgical 
working of the larger copper plants 
he had visited.
An early meeting of the Crucible 
Club will be held at which some topic 
of interest to the metallurgists will 
be given. It is hoped a larger attend­
ance of members will turn out to the 
next meeting.
ELECTRICALS DEFEAT 
CIVILS—6-0.
On a field of mud and water and 
under a sky as dark as the day of the 
Pitt-State game, the Science Soph. 
Electricals triumphed over the Civils 
by the score 6-0, at the match played 
on Tech Field Tuesday, December the 
2nd.
Jones, the Live Wires’ half back, 
was shifted to the line near the end 
of the third quarter, from where he 
got a forward pass and ran fifty yards 
for the only score made. Through­
out the game, the sides were quite 
evenly matched.
The victory of the Mechanicals over 
the Chemicals on November 26th 
leaves the class championship between 
the Engine Wipers and the Live 
Wires; but owing to the present state 
of football affairs and the inability 
of the managers to get suits for their 
teams, the matches will probably not 
be played off.
THE THISTLE.
Another important meeting of the 
Thistle board was held last Wednes­
day evening. At that time it was de­
cided to award the contract for taking 
the photographs to W. G. G. Altwater. 
The pictures this year, as last year, 
will be taken in the studio of the De­
sign School, immediately after the 
Christmas holidays. As many of the 
class pictures as possible are to be 
taken next week. Thistle subscrip­
tions are selling, according to the so­
licitors, which is greatly helping along 
the work of the board. Anyone know­
ing any grinds, jokes or anything 
worth putting in the Thistle should
drop it in the boxes.
THINKS ATHLETICS BEST IN 
BUSINESS.
Participation in athletics in youth 
fits a man better for the struggle for 
business supremacy in after life than 
non-athletic pursuit. This is the view 
of Dr. Dudley A. Sargent, Harvard’s 
famed director of athletics, who says:
“Baseball, football, and all athletics 
have cut a big figure in the develop­
ment of the American business man. 
It might be pointed out that from 
the time that sports began to engage 
universal attention, began the wonder­
ful industrial expansion of the nation.
“The tendency of the games is to 
make a man alert, and thus he uncon­
sciously thinks quickly. Why should 
not this trait be handed down to the 
man when he takes up his life’s work? 
It is bound to show up in his vocation. 
Thus business supremacy in the 
United States might be traced in a 
measure to early work on the dia­
mond, gridiron, or cinder track.
“It is a fact that athletics have 
quickened education. The relaxation 
from the study of the three Rs which 
athletics have afforded has made the 
child’s mind brighter, when he has 
gone back to the study period. Our 
athletic supremacy has its drawbacks, 
however. It is receiving too much at­
tention. For weeks the public is 
keyed up by the newspapers and other 
agencies as to its outcome, especially 
in the big football games.
“Everybody is agog with excite­
ment and then the game is played It 
is talked over for weeks afterwards 
and the emotional excitement does not 
really find its outlet here, but seeks 
other less desirable channels.
“Excitement that feeds by what it 
grows on does not allay. Thus, if we 
do not allay this excitement it will 
react to our detriment.”
QUICK, ACCURATE ENGLISH!
Newspaper men have no reason to 
complain of the way they are treated 
by college professors. There are still 
plenty of academies to whom 'news­
paper English” is a synonym1 for 
slovenliness, prolixity and violence; 
and it would be too much to expect 
that the “highbrow” element should 
surrender without a struggle. On the 
other hand, the number of college 
instructors in English who are setting 
up the newspaper ideal for their stu­
dents is growing mightily.—New York 
Evening Post.

DUQUESNE—“ST. ELMO.”
For the week preceding the glorious 
yuletide Mr. Harry Davis, in obedi­
ence to the wishes of a majority of 
the patrons of the Home of Pitts­
burgh’s Stock Company, has arranged 
for an elaborate revival of James 
Slevin’s greatest of all heart-interest 
dramas, “St. Elmo,” and it will be 
produced by the full complement of 
the Harry Davis Players beginning 
with matinee Monday, December IS, 
and continuing twice daily. Advance 
sale of seats is now at the Box Office 
of the Duquesne.
WALTZING.
Waltzing is the dreamiest form of 
social dancing. Once upon a time 
it was the leading favorite at the sum­
mer hotels, but now it is being cruel­
ly elbowed off the wax by such 
popular toe teasers as the turkey trot, 
the alligator crawl, the ’possum prance 
and the fire hose wriggle.
The waltz will soon be as absolete 
as the minuet and the hoe-down if 
some one doesn’t come to the rescue 
and buy it a new pair of crutches. 
However, you can’t tell when waltzing 
is likely to rush back into style, so it 
behooves every summer vacationist to 
learn how to do it. Don’t delay, but 
do it now while the behooving is good.
To quit preaching and get down to 
science, it must be explained that the 
waltz is performed with three beats 
to the measure, a happy expression, 
and, on hot nights, a wilted rag for 
a collar. A beautiful partner is often 
thought necessary for successful
waltzing, but don’t you believe it. 
The peaches don’t always make the 
best waltzerines!
Look along the row of waiting girls 
on the veranda and pick out one of 
the plain, staple sizes. You will find 
her easier to wheel about and, if it 
happens that you are always getting 
tangled up with your extra feet, she 
may take you in hand, do all the steer­
ing and then whisper that your waltz­
ing is “just divine” for a beginner!
Friendships scraped up while scrap­
ing through the waltz are likely to 
make a deep impression—often with 
romantic results. Waltz music is 
nearly always dreamy and it takes to 
sentiment and romantic cooing like a 
duck to a bath tub. Thousands of men 
have proposed marriage in the sway­
ing mazes of the waltz who would 
never think of breathing sweet noth­
ings while zipping to the meter of 
the gorilla grab, the box car lope or 
the gartersnake glide!
Many thousands have remarked that 
they could die waltzing. But they 
should worry, for most of them1 never 
took the trouble to really learn.
The most difficult move in the 
waltz is the reverse, or southpaw turn.
Some men who can reverse the 
speed trigger on a six-cylinder gas­
oline gig going 90 miles an hour and 
slow down the car within three inches 
of a basket of soft-boiled eggs are 
unable to do the waltz reverse with­
out skidding. Others are born to it, 
and from such are selected the cotil­
lion leaders and umpires at turkey 
trotteriests.
Alas, the waltz is almost dead! But 
on with the dance, on with the tango, 
the sea cow slide and the pickle dip! 
We’ll use the waltz only as a filler-in 
while the fire brigade rushes to the 
orchestra balcony and puts out a hot- 
box in the snare drum.
THE BIG CITIES ARE 
LEARNING.
That the skyscraper evil in New 
York must be checked is the unani­
mous conclusion of the committee on 
building height restriction appointed 
by Mr. McAneny, the borough presi­
dent of Manhattan. If the regulations 
agreed upon by this body of archi­
tects, engineers, real estate men and 
city planners are adopted no build­
ing can be erected to a height of more 
than eighteen stories, though towers 
may be carried as much higher as the 
owner pleasps. But eighteen stories 
is the maximum for solid buildings and 
is to be permitted only where there 
is plenty of space, as at street cor­
ners; otherwise the limit set is sixteen 
stories. And beyond that there are 
restrictions based on the width of the 
street, which must be half the height 
of the building, and “zones” are rec­
ommended to prevent the injury of 
neighborhoods by buildings of an un­
desirable type. Altogether the law 
proposed is progressive, and for New 
York nothing short of revolutionary, 
and it is to be noted that action 
is being urged on precisely those eco­
nomic grounds which were urged 
years ago by reformers, but at the
time received little notice. Quite 
aside from esthetic considerations, 
high buildings have been found to 
destroy the rentable value not only 
of neighboring buildings, but of the 
skyscrapers themselves, which the 
committee finds to have been “smoth­
ered by their own 'growth.’ ” In 
short, it is not feasible architecture 
for general adoption, and New York 
is being forced, like Chicago, to fix 
limits in self-defense. This measure 
may be defeated, but sentiment is 
growing so rapidly that the adoption 
of restrictions is now looked upon as 
inevitable. — The Springfield Repub­
lican.
AUTOMOBILE SLAUGHTER.
Ten times as many people are an­
nually killed by automobiles in New 
York as in London. The population 
of London is half again as large and 
its activities are as great, widespread 
and incessant. London cries out con­
stantly against the dangers from 
motor buses and taxicabs, yet in 
twelve months it witnessed but twen­
ty-one fatalities. During the same 
time New York saw 234. Why the 
difference? London’s police commis­
sioner tells us. “In London,” he says, 
“we hold a man accountable when he 
kills.” “Influence,” he adds, “does not 
take precedence over public welfare.” 
In American cities pull, indulgence, 
privilege and misplaced sympathy all 
unite to favor the terrible development 
of recknessness and irrseponsibility. 
One law for all, and that law well 
enforced—such is the remedy for this 
great and growing evil.—Chicago 
Record-Herald.
If a man leads the people astray 
in politics and says little, he’s a boss 
If he leads them astray and talks all 
the time, he’s a demagogue. But there 
are always lots of people who dearly 
love to be led astray.

ALUMNI SMOKER AT FORT 
PITT.
RAISING VENISON.
Saturday evening fifty members of 
the Alumni Association of the Schools 
of Applied Science and Design, met 
in the Dutch Room of the Fort Pitt 
Hotel for the first smoker of the year. 
Dean Leete was present and spoke 
on the relation of the Alumni Asso­
ciation to the School. The Dean gave 
many suggestions, some of which will 
undoubtedly be carried out.
The athletic situation as regards to 
football was discussed at some length, 
and recommendations were made 
which will be submitted to the Di­
rector and the Supervisor of Ath­
letics.
The smoker went off with great suc­
cess and the committee in charge 
should be congratulated.
GRADUATE TO HEAD INSTRUC­
TION AT MARQUETTE.
An experiment in keeping deer for 
commercial purposes was made in 
Lincolnshire a century ago. Sir Jos­
eph Banks, says a cotemporary chron­
icler, ‘‘tried the annual expenditure in 
the article of deer in his park at Rev- 
eesby, containing 320 acres of land 
and 300 head of deer, from Michael­
mas, 1801, to Michaelmas, 1802, set­
ting against it the estimated rent of 
land, taxes, labor, servants, wages, 
cost of maintaining fences, etc.” After 
three years’ trial he found himself 
averaging £52 per annum net profit 
from the sale of venison.
The red deer was accused by Gil­
bert White of being ‘‘one of the worst 
corrupters of men's morals” of his 
days, for, as he explained, “most men 
are sportsmen by constitution,” and 
the temptation to hunt the vast num­
bers of deer then roaming the moors 
and forests was irresistible. No 
young man. he affirms, was allowed to 
be possessed of manhood or gallantry 
unless he were “a hunter, or in other 
words, a deer-stealer.” — London 
Chronicle.
E. L. Schumacher was recently ap­
pointed to direct the instruction in 
Business Organization and Manage­
ment in The Robert A. Johnston Col­
lege of Economics of Marquette Uni­
versity. Mr. Schumacher had five 
years of special training at the Car­
negie Institute of Technology of 
Pittsburgh and is now efficiency ex­
pert of the Gender Paeschke, and Frey 
Company of Milwaukee. — Clipping

CLASSIFIED LIST OF TARTAN ADVERTISERS
We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
variety of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.
