MUCH TO THE SURPRISE of his mother and fraternity broth­
ers, Add. Gilmore was announced as the Skib'ó Hobo at the Tar- 
tan'Banquet . . . For a whlle this column was çhanglng hands 
faster than a fiot penny ; . . Al Fenderabn?-who wrote the first 
couple issues and then left'town,. was followed by Julian Munster 
. , . After a couple months the mighty pen was taken òver-.by- 
Jack “Speed” Provost, who.was persuaded by the administration' 
that It would be to bis advantage to pursue education rather 
'than life . . . and at mid-year Gilmore’ devoted 'liiiiisélf lo the . 
cause . . . Some of his best quips were censored for the benefit ' , 
of the student body in general and the Deane Jn particular ...
; a lot of the material .came through àn undercover scout, system. \
THE TARTAN BANQUET went over In its usual grand style; 
and a6 announced, no outside speakers . . . apparently tbe Car­
negie sheet has the largest staff of any college newspaper . . . 
ninety-six students signed up for the free meal, and even Will 
Lnndsburg can’t figure out where the other seventy came from!
HIGH SPOT of Exhibition Night was theNreally classical demon­
stration of medieval printing put on by Paul Moore and Guy Hal- 
ferly ... if you didn’t see the boys In those wigs and the rest 
of-that get-up, just imagine old P. J. with blond hair, blushing 
violently, and laughing to himself all evening ... the expected 
number of visitors inquired as to the whereabouts of the life . 
drawing classes . . . and someone told us that the outstanding 
feature of the model concrete home was tbe Inspiring photograph 
of Carole Lombard In the bedroom!
THE WEEK-END w^s favored with several initiations by the va­
rious clubs on the campus . . . following formal ceremonies Sat­
urday, a large part of the Beta clan settled down for. a quiet' even­
ing at one of the town’s more popular literary societies .... 
pretty cute, heh Keith? . .... Bettle Initiation took place Satur- 
' day night and thé next morning . . . and the Beta Pi’s climaxed 
theirs with a tea daiice at the Pittsburgh Country Club . . . Bad 
weather and doubt as to dress probably accounted fór ihe 'email 
. crowd at the Spring Formal . . . very nice, though, nnd plenty ' 
of room to dance ... as expected, the .boys wore every thing 
' from tuxedos to linen suits.
MISUNDERSTOOD were Senior M&ggie Murphs Watters, Had- 
dock and Barr last Friday-while attempting to appear sweet and 
innocent before the'visiting high school girls . . . very naively 
they stopped Hal - Baer in front ' of Sklbo and falgettoed, 
“¦\Vhere's-Margaret Morrisoh?’.’wv. . whereupon two passing 
high school lasses took them,at:appatent value, and graciously 
pointed out the building.' * • . - . ,
A -NEW MEANS of distinguishing college students ought to be 
devised since the passing,of the faccoon coat and hlp.flask . . . 
quite noticeable and. amusing were thè' • Techites’ attempts to, 
appear “collltch11’ before Exhibition visitors . . . although classes , 
were dismissed for the afternoon, everyone hung around to 
give the school atmosphère and at the.same time review, the 
possibilities presented by, the-high school graduating classes 
. . . biggest shine of the day were the-Tau. Delta Phi’s-who hod 
the radio blaring while they 8at':conspIcuously on their porch 
-'-with.'gurls! •
IS HIS FACE. RED! . . . After talking for over twenty minutes 
about.the merits of a particular machine'during the Exhibition., 
Norm. Caplan, ex-law student and erstwhile, printer, found that 
each one in his group of supposed listeners-was deaf—students of' 
a deaf and dumb school here In town.

The fact that Long’s speech came during the scime wfeek ther Coughlin’s official entrance in­to politics is significant. Some have tried to find evidence of an al­liance between the two. Whelh< or not there 16 anything definite s. an alliance ttetweeh them, the fact remains that they are much alike in essential-purpose-and prinicple. The sixteen points of Coughlin', program resemble strongly the promises made by Long, which in • turn resemble the platforms pre­sented by all demagogues and would-be dictators, Hitler and Mussolini included.
Through these very promises these men have gained the power they-possess, the large following they maintain. People are so eas­ily convinced by skillful oratory that they seldom stop, to consider the significance of the words, which are uttered. One cannot .really ac­cuse either Long or Coughlin ot insincerity. Ohey are sincere in .their-own desires—those of attain­ing power.

Exhibition -
Thè demonstrations presented by théstudéntg last-'Friday night were 
¦well worth- the time spent on the campus. Th'e thousands of visitors who attended were given-the tip- . portu'nlty Co view the wordings of a great' system of education which ,has had so much to do with the • of .nation we have become.
r Carnegie Tech- ’ has • much of which.to beproud.'but as we read 'of unique methods- and bizarre courses designed for the sugar* . coating of-the pill'of knowledge: .we feel that the-school’s proudest achievement has been in sticking to Its purpose and to itB .high stand* 
.aid.'-
' As we look upon the list of grad* ; ùales-who have made their .places Sn the world we find many nation- aUy known figures. This in itself is an .indication ' of tho school's standard of scholarship.
- ' .‘Although'tho night students may Hot play a large part In this annual exhibition, the fact remains that they, have been a large' factor in the development of on. educational curricula which is equal to that ; .presented by any college in. thè 
/country. .
of the night school there can be no , reason, why the night students .--should not present such a demon* Btr-atlonthemeelves,

Activity -Chain Links
Other groups assisting- from ill 
i time In keeping kindled the 
terést in activities on/the-part of 
thé night student* were the C I T 
Generators, - Graphicae, Sketch 
Club, Electricals, Sheet .Metals, 
Carpenters, Masonry men, ; Indus­
trial Acts as jwell as those .talcing 
courses in music and drama--,
As the names would imply, the 
.'ajarity of these groupé were de* 
partmental .ones. and were inter­
ested-. primariry -in-tneir respective department, although in most cases general invitation was extended > all the students of the campus. 
While each of these groups held t least one Informal function dur- ig the school year, some of them held several-meetings. In the case of the- Sketch Club, thelv -objective was to carry on between the tonnai closing ' of the night school -year until the reopening in the fall.
Perhaps the most successful one of the departmental groups, that is, Svhich seemed to carry.on the longest and created the most interest,-was the Electricals, This holds the record for a long period and it is only within the last years .that the function has been omitted. This smoker wris al- /ell supported in- the early years of night school and was look­ed.forward to with considei’able In* terest by the night electrical stu­dents. ( >
As .may be; surmised it was ex­ceedingly difficult to keep the spirit alive because of,student turnover from year to year and one by one these departmental eoclalfunctiona dropped out of what .wan-then the social .calendar of thé night school year'. They ;are*now only memories

A. man who visited a Chesterfield
factory recently, said: "Now that I have 
seen Chesterfields made, I understand 
better than ever why people say Chester­
fields are milder and have a better taste
If you too could visit our factories you could 
see the dean, airy surroundings; the employees 
in their spotless uniforms, and the modern ciga­
rette making machinery.
You could notice how carefully each Chester­
field cigarette is inspected and see. also how 
Chesterfields arc practically untouched by human 
hands.
Whenever you happen to be in Richmond.Va., 
Durham, N. C., or San Francisco, California, we 
invite you to stop at the Liggett & Myers plants 
and see how Chesterfields are made.
