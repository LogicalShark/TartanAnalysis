Morewood live-in mentor arrested for invasion of privacy
LAURA SCHERB
Publisher
On Thursday morning, 
ex-Carnegie Mellon student 
Daniel Jorge was arrested on 
invasion of privacy charges for 
allegedly taking photos and 
videos of fellow Morewood E-
Tower residents in the shower 
and bathrooms.
Jorge, who was a live-in 
mentor on the sixth ?oor of 
the ?rst-year dormitory, was 
expelled last semester af-
ter students accused him of 
holding his cell phone above 
the showers they occupied. 
The ?rst accusations came in 
early September, according to 
WPXI.com.
At the beginning of this se-
mester, residents on the sixth 
?oor of E-Tower received an 
email from their resident as-
sistant saying that “this [?oor 
meeting] was not just a typical 
start of semester ?oor meet-
ing. In last nights [sic] meet-
ing we talked about a very 
serious incident that occurred 
last semester on our ?oor.”
According to the email, 
the ?oor meeting addressed 
the incident. Students were 
then handed a letter which 
explained the timeline of the 
incident investigation.
University police opened 
an investigation after the ac-
cusations were made, accord-
ing to the letter. Jorge’s access 
to Morewood E-Tower was 
revoked the day he admitted 
to the crime. He was perma-
nently removed from campus 
the day after and will not be 
returning.
University police then en-
listed the help of forensics 
specialists at the Pennsylva-
nia State Police crime lab. The 
specialists analyzed data from 
electronic devices con?scated 
from Jorge. The analysis re-
vealed videos of eleven men.
“Among these, three vid-
eos include partial or full im-
ages from the neck up that 
positioned University Police 
and Student Life to success-
fully identify three of the men 
whose images were captured 
on video,” the letter says. “The 
remaining eight video clips in-
clude images of torsos, waists, 
legs, and/or feet that do not 
enable the viewer to ascertain 
the identity of the person in 
the video.”
Pizza + Politics event sparks debate
RACHEL COHEN
Contributing Editor
On a campus widely consid-
ered to be apolitical, a Student 
Senate initiative sought to 
start politically charged con-
versation and disagreement 
with the ?rst iteration of Pizza 
+ Politics on Wednesday.
The event, which garnered 
177 responses out of nearly 
1,300 invites on Facebook, 
?lled two-thirds of the round-
tables in Rangos 3, with each 
table designated a student or 
faculty facilitator to engage 
and mediate participant dis-
cussion with guided ques-
tions, and a box of pizza.
Facilitators included ad-
junct professor Mary Jo Mill-
er, Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs Renee Camerlengo, 
junior chemical engineering 
major Michael Wesley Booker 
II, junior history major Ashley 
Sobhani, junior psychology 
and French double major Si-
riana Abboud, Senate Chair 
and junior information sys-
tems major Evan Wineland, 
senior global studies major 
Julia Constantine, Assistant 
Director of Student Life Da-
vid Chickering, Coordinator 
of Gender Programs and Sex-
ual Violence Prevention Jess 
Klein, adjunct professor Colin 
Clarke, and Teaching Profes-
sor of Political Science and 
International Relations Silvia 
Borzutzky.
The topic of the event 
was “The Right to be Offen-
sive: What can we take away 
from Charlie Hebdo and The 
Interview?” and discussion 
launched right away and 
lasted the full hour, with each 
table taking a different track 
in group conversation.
Students pondered Sony’s 
The Interview as an example of 
free speech and North Korea’s 
response as a threat to that 
expression.
“These regimes survive on 
keeping tight control on their 
image,” said junior economics 
and statistics major Guillermo 
Marce-Santurio. “This movie 
makes them seem weak.”
Conversation also focused 
on the attack at Charlie Hebdo. 
Facilitator Abboud posed the 
question, when making an 
SCS: You’re in...or not.

Carnegie Mellon joined 
the likes of the Massachu-
setts Institute of Technol-
ogy (MIT) and Johns Hop-
kins University last Monday 
when about 800 applicants 
to the school’s master’s in 
computer science program 
were informed via email 
that they had been accept-
ed, only to ?nd out seven 
hours later in another email 
that the acceptances were a 
mistake.
Monday afternoon, 
many applicants received 
an email with “CMU Ad-
missions Decision” in the 
subject line that told them, 
“Congratulations on your 
acceptance into the Master 
of Science program in Com-
puter Science at Carnegie 
Mellon. You are one of the 
select few, less than 9% of 
the more than 1200 appli-
cants, that we are inviting. 
We’re convinced this is the 
right place for you. Wel-
come to Carnegie Mellon!”
The email continues 
with a list of “bragging 
points” that applicants 
could take advantage of, 
such as Carnegie Mellon’s 
number one ranking in the 
?eld of computer science by 
U.S. News & World Report.
Seven hours later, ap-
plicants received a second 
email: “Earlier this morn-
ing, we mistakenly sent 
you an offer of admission 
to Carnegie Mellon’s MS in 
CS program. This was an 
error on our part. While we 
certainly appreciate your 
interest in our program, we 
regret that we are unable 
to offer you admission this 
year.” This email, sent by 
Frank Pfenning, president’s 
professor of computer sci-
ence and department head, 
asked that recipients ac-
knowledged that they got 
the second email.
Some mistakenly ac-
cepted applicants had al-
ready made plans in the 
seven hours between the 
two emails; Ben Leibowitz 
went out to dinner with his 
parents and called his rela-
tives before he found out 
about the miscommunica-
tion.
“It was brutal. I didn’t 
get much sleep last night,” 
Leibowitz said to the Asso-
ciated Press. “Now I have to 
clean up the mess. I’m call-
ing all my relatives, I’m go-
ing, ‘I’m sorry it’s not hap-
pening.’ ”
In December, almost 
300 applicants to Johns 
Hopkins University under-
went a similar emotional 
rollercoaster when they 
were informed of their ac-
ceptance only to ?nd out a 
few hours later that it was a 
mistake. MIT made a com-
prable mistake a year ago;

The university recently 
announced two new faculty 
appointments: Farnam Jah-
anian as university provost, 
effective at the end of the 
academic year, and Steve 
Kloehn as vice president for 
marketing and communica-
tions, effective April 7.
Farnam Jahanian be-
gan his career at Carnegie 
Mellon last year as the vice 
president for research, 
where he, according to a 
campus-wide email sent out 
from university President 
Subra Suresh, “garnered 
uncommon praise inter-
nally and externally for his 
vision, work ethic, and pas-
sion for what Carnegie Mel-
lon is and what we aspire to 
be.”
Before he came to Carn-
egie Mellon, Jahanian 
worked at the National 
Science Foundation Direc-
torate for Computer and 
Information Science and 
Engineering (CISE), con-
trolling a $900 million bud-
get and leading research on 
cyber infrastructure. Prior 
to his work at the founda-
tion, Jahanian was the Ed-
ward S. Davidson collegiate 
professor at the Univer-
sity of Michigan, where he 
served as chair for Comput-
er Science and Engineering 
from 2007 to 2011, and as 
director of the Software 
Systems Laboratory from 
1997 to 2000. Jahanian 
earned his master’s degree 
and a Ph.D. in Computer 
Science from the University 
of Texas at Austin.
Jahanian is replacing the 
Dr. Frederick A. Schwertz 
Distinguished Professor of 
Life Sciences and Interim 
Provost Nathan Urban.
“Nathan is a distin-
guished academic who has 
had success throughout his 
tenure at the university, and 
his taking on this role was a 
clear indication of his great 
dedication to this commu-
nity,” Suresh wrote in his 
email.

The American Heart As-
sociation has given a grant to 
the department of biomedical 
engineering to found a pro-
gram in which undergradu-
ate students will be trained to 
apply their knowledge of the 
?eld to developing technolo-
gies for clinical cardiovascu-
lar medicine.
Many of the existing car-
diovascular programs are at 
schools with medical schools. 
The Carnegie Mellon pro-
gram will focus on the ap-
plication of engineering and 
technology to this ?eld.
“The hope is that this 
initial experience will lead 
students on a career path in 
biomedical engineering,” 
said Keith Cook, associate 
professor of biomedical en-
gineering who is co-leading 
the initiative, in a university 
press release. “Our biomedi-
cal engineering department 
has a very strong core in car-
diovascular research, so we 
sensed an opportunity with 
this program.”
The program will start 
in May. Students will then 
spend ten weeks working 
with Carnegie Mellon fac-
ulty on a project that applies 
biomedical engineering to 
cardiovascular research, in 
addition to shadowing clini-
cians at Allegheny General 
Hospital for one day every 
two weeks.
Director of the cardiovas-
cular MRI program at Allegh-
eny General Hospital Robert 
Biederman said in the press 
release, “Many of our young 
students that spend the sum-
mer with us go on to medical 
school and become indepen-
dent clinicians trained with 
unique understandings of 
how to perform and interpret 
medical research.”
“In order for students to 
be effective researchers in 
this area, the students should 
understand cardiovascular 
medicine in general,” Cook 
added. “It is important that 
they see the application 
of clinical cardiovascular 
medicine, from imaging or 
catheter-based diagnosis to 
pharmacological or surgical 
treatment.”
American Heart Association gives CMU grant
UN gives honorable mention to ETC game
 A game developed by stu-
dents at the Entertainment 
Technology Center (ETC) 
has received an honorable 
mention by the United Na-
tions Alliance of Civilizations 
PEACEapp competition.
The game, titled, Triangle 
of Life, was developed for 
children who have expe-
rienced trauma. Students 
developed the game while 
paired with doctors from the 
Allegheny Health Network 
who were looking for new 
ways for children to under-
stand Trauma-Focused Cog-
nitive Behavioral Therapy 
(TF-CBT).
The doctors “were very 
interested in seeing if there 
was something the students 
could do to help with one 
particular area — the tri-
angle of thoughts, feelings 
and behaviors that children 
have a dif?cult time with,” 
said Scott Stevens, a profes-
sor at the ETC and one of the 
project’s advisors. “All they 
had were pieces of paper 
with a diagram. They want-
ed something that was more 
impactful.”
The game involves a 
character named Lion, who 
tries to ?gure out why other 
animals are discontent. “You 
have to jump from platform 
to platform and categorize 
ideas as thoughts, feelings 
or behaviors to unlock ac-
cess to additional platforms 
until you are eventually able 
to reach the exit and solve a 
story-relevant TF-CBT ques-
tion to complete the level,” 
said lead programmer and 
game designer Eric Chang of 
the gameplay.
The team that developed 
the game met weekly with 
the developers of TF-CBT, 
doctors Anthony Mannarino 
and Judith Cohen.
“Working with the team 
from the Entertainment 
Technology Center was a ter-
ri?c experience for us,” Co-
hen said in the release. “We 
were impressed with their 
interdisciplinary talents and 
how quickly they meshed to-
gether as a team. The African 
jungle theme was wonder-
ful. When I ?rst saw the pro-
totype for the Lion character, 
I thought, ‘Kids are going to 
love this!’ The game does a 
great job of helping children 
learn how to use cognitive 
processing.”
Triangle of Life is expected 
to be released on multiple 
platforms in March.

art gallery on Carnegie Mel-
lon’s campus. The Frame 
gallery is trying to become 
more of a focal point for

The Joint Funding Com-
mittee presented to Senate 
on how the student activity 
fee is used. Senate receives 
10 percent of the money from 
the undergraduate student 
activities fee, while the Grad-
uate Student Assembly (GSA) 
gets 70 percent of graduate 
student activities fees.
The discussion in Senate 
focused on whether or not 
student organizations could 
pay student salaries with 
JFC-allocated funds original-
ly from the student activities 
fee. The JFC must now ap-
prove salaries paid by student 
organizations from JFC fees.
Benchmarking Committee report
The Benchmarking Com-
mittee gave a report on the stu-
dent government situation at 
some of Carnegie Mellon’s peer 
institutions, including Cornell 
University, Princeton Univer-
sity, and Duke University. The 
committee discussed different 
facets of student government, 
including how student repre-
sentatives at other universities 
communicate effectively with 
their constituents.

Dean of Student Affairs 
Gina Casalegno and Vice 
Provost for Education Amy 
Burkert gave a presenta-

focus areas in the univer-
sity’s strategic plan. The 
university wants to provide 
a transformative Carnegie 
Mellon experience compris-
ing transformative research 
and transformative teaching 
at both the graduate and un-
dergraduate level.
There will be another 
university-wide town hall 
meeting on a date to be deter-
mined in March, Casalegno 
and Burkert said.
Statistically Speaking
Each year, the Career and 
Professional Development 
Center at Carnegie Mellon col-
lects information about post-
graduation salaries and job 
destinations for students. Stu-
dents graduating in 2014 with 
a Master of Science in Comput-
er Science went to a number of 
prominent companies, includ-
ing Amazon, Dropbox, and 
Google. They ended up highly 
concentrated in western states 
such as California, Nevada, 
and Hawaii. In light of School 
of Computer Science’s mistake 
in sending out approximately 
800 false acceptances, below 
is a breakdown of graduates 
from the master’s program:
$125,000 
The maximum starting salary received by a 
student that earned a master of science in 
computer science.
$80,000 
The minimum salary received by a student that 
earned a master of science in computer science.
$101,833
The average salary received by students upon 
graduation from the master’s program.

February 23, 2015 « The Tartan thetartan.org/news » A3
a blog post from their Of?ce 
of Admission blamed the mail 
delivery system that they use 
to email applicants.
Incidents like these go 
back years — in 2013, Ford-
ham University falsely noti-
?ed about 2,500 applicants 
that they had been accepted, 
and in 2012 the University of 
California, Los Angeles told al-
most 900 applicants the same.
According to a press re-
lease on the School of Com-
puter Science’s website, Mon-
day’s error “was the result of 
serious mistakes in our pro-
cess for generating acceptance 
letters. Once the error was dis-
covered, the university moved 
quickly to notify affected ap-
plicants.”
“We understand the dis-
appointment created by this 
mistake, and deeply apologize 
to the applicants for this mis-
communication,” the release 
continues, then going on to 
reassure applicants that no fu-
ture mistakes take place. 
“We are currently review-
ing our noti?cation process to 
help ensure this does not hap-
pen in the future.”

Junior mechanical 
engineering major Paul Kioko 
echoed Abboud’s question: 
“Before you say something, 
are you thinking about pos-
sible reactions?”
Toward the end of dis-
cussion, facilitators shifted 
conversation toward expres-
sion on campus: Should 
college students enjoy the 
same rights on campus as the 
rest of America?
“This is a private institu-
tion, and when I agreed to 
come to CMU, I agreed to 
follow the rules they have,” 
Marce-Santurio said.
“Being in society has an 
inherent loss of rights to it,” 
said junior business major 
Hodei García. “I will give up 
my right to kill you so you 
don’t kill me.”
According to Wineland, 
who spearheaded the event, 
Pizza + Politics is a response 
to Herbert Simon’s concept 
of “poverty of attention,” by 
which an overabundance 
of external stimuli causes 
people to tune out important 
global events.
“There is a culture of apa-
thy on campus,” Wineland 
said. But beyond tackling po-
litical inattention, Wineland 
said the program is also an 
attempt to foster connections 
between Senate and the stu-
dent body.
“We’ve always sought to 
engage with students,” Wine-
land said, comparing Pizza 
+ Politics to past town hall 
meetings, which he said were 
not as well received. About 
achieving this level of en-
gagement, Wineland said, “It 
doesn’t have to be that com-
plicated. It can be simple — 
as simple as a conversation.”
“We were all excited and 
we got the word out,” said 
junior computer science ma-
jor and School of Computer 
Science senator Gail Wilson, 
who attended and helped 
organize the event. “We got 
great facilitators.”
“I thought it was 
encouraging,” Wilson said. “I

Steve Kloehn comes to 
Carnegie Mellon from the 
University of Chicago, where 
he is associate vice president 
for news and public affairs. 
Before that, Kloehn was a 
writer, columnist, and edi-
tor for over 20 years the Chi-
cago Tribune and at various 
newspapers in New England, 
Kloehn received his bach-
elor’s degree in English from 
Princeton University.
“Steve brings to this role 
extensive experience in spear-
heading strategic integrated 
communications and market-
ing campaigns that have led 
to raising national and global 
visibility,” President Suresh 
said in a university press re-
lease. “His reputation as a 
hands-on, innovative leader 
and communicator make him 
a perfect ?t for this new role 
and CMU.”
The university created 
Kloehn’s position as part of 
the Strategic Plan; in an email 
last semester, Suresh called 
the search for a vice president 
for marketing and communi-
cations a “critical step toward 
enhancing our reputation na-
tionally and globally to match 
our extraordinary achieve-
ments.”
“CMU has a long history 
of innovation that changes 
lives and enriches the world,” 
Kloehn said in a university 
press release. 
“As a communicator, I am 
excited to have the opportuni-
ty to tell the CMU story. I look 
forward to working in part-
nership with CMU’s scholars, 
students and alumni around 
the globe to shine a light on 
their outstanding and far-
reaching work. I am honored, 
too, to join CMU’s outstand-
ing leadership team and its 
talented staff.”
Administrative roles set to be ?lled
Moushey announces vision to right wrongful convictions at CMU
KRUTI KOPPOLU
Junior Staffwriter
Bill Moushey was once a 
reporter who just covered bad 
guys.
“For the ?rst 20 years of my 
career, I basically put people in 
jail,” he said.
His work as a reporter 
includes covering the ?rst 
impeachment of former sit-
ting Pennsylvania Supreme 
Court Justice Rolf Larsen 
and the conviction of former 
Pittsburgh City Council presi-
dent, among other notable 
investigations detailing orga-
nized crime. During his time 
working as an investigative 
reporter with the Pittsburgh 
Post-Gazette, he noticed the 
injustice present within the 
justice system.
“I started seeing horrible 
things happen to people of 
color, people in poverty, and 
those who could not receive 
adequate legal representa-
tion,” he said. “They would 
just get gobbled up by the fed-
eral government.”
Today, Moushey aims to 
bring Point Park University’s 
Innocence Institute, which he 
founded in 2001 to help those 
wrongfully convicted in west-
ern Pennsylvania, to Carnegie 
Mellon. Last Monday in Baker 
Hall’s Giant Eagle Auditorium, 
Moushey talked about his 
work with the institute and his 
plans for its future.
Working as investiga-
tive journalists at Point Park, 
Moushey and his students 
have been responsible for free-
ing 17 wrongly convicted indi-
viduals in 10 years.
Both a nonpro?t investi-
gative journalism program 
and a university curriculum 
at Point Park, the Innocence 
Institute’s approach has two 
primary focuses: the students 
and social injustice. The insti-
tute’s objective is to aid stu-
dents in navigating the ropes 
of the criminal justice system 
while simultaneously making 
a social difference.
“There is no constituency 
for people who are wrongful-
ly convicted,” Moushey said. 
“Nobody wants to hear them.”
Since its inception 14 years 
ago, the Innocence Insti-
tute and its journalists have 
received numerous awards 
including regional and na-
tional awards, from the Na-
tional Society of Professional 
Journalists.
Before founding the insti-
tute, Moushey used his obser-
vations of the justice system 
led him to publish in the Post-
Gazette the investigative series 
Protected Witnesses, which 
examines the misconduct in-
volved with the federal wit-
ness protection program, and 
Win at All Costs, hard-hitting 
documentation of overzealous 
of?cials breaking the law in 
their efforts to enforce it.
At Carnegie Mellon, 
Moushey spoke of past cases 
and his vision of establishing 
a multidisciplinary Innocence 
Institute at Carnegie Mellon.
“At CMU, we would be 
on the forefront of advances 
that change the way wrongly 
convicted cases are viewed,” 
Moushey said.
He encouraged the involve-
ment of students from all 
?elds.
“This is without a doubt 
the best experience that [Point 
Park] ever offered. No classes 
even come close to the Inno-
cence Institute,” said senior 
Point Park mass communica-
tions major Kaitlyn Castelli, 
who has worked closely with 
Moushey and the Innocence 
Institute since her ?rst year of 
college.
A native of Canton, Ohio 
and an expert on crime and 
punishment issues, Moushey 
is a nationally recognized 
journalist who earned his 
bachelor of arts in journalism 
from Kent State University 
and his master’s of science in 
criminal justice administra-
tion from Point Park. Moushey 
is a recipient of the 1997 Na-
tional Press Club’s Freedom of 
Information Award and was a 
?nalist for the Pulitzer Prize in 
1997 for his expose of an out-
of-control federal witness pro-
tection program.
For Moushey, the years 
of effort pay off the mo-
ment when the wrongfully 
convicted walk out of prison.
During his talk, he nar-
rated an experience in which 
his client, after being released, 
looked him in the eye and said, 
“You guys are my heroes.”

The letter ends with a 
statement assuring residents 
that there is no evidence 
that the videos and images 
were shared online and 
encourages residents to seek 
out help from their resident 
assistant, community adviser, 
housefellow, Associate Dean 
of Student Affairs John Han-
non, Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services, and the Co-
ordinator of Sexual Violence 
Prevention Jess Klein.
The university released a 
media statement on Thurs-
day afternoon, once the ar-
rest was made public, but 
most university af?liates have 
declined to comment, redi-
recting inquiries to media re-
lations staff or to Dean of Stu-
dent Affairs Gina Casalegno.
“In our media statement, 
we were clear that for any of 
the individuals impacted by 
this incident, we have offered 
the support of the student 
life staff and the university 
staff,” Casalegno said in an 
interview with The Tartan. 
“We’ve advised the individual 
victims of their rights to the 
criminal process and ensured 
that they have the knowledge 
and information necessary 
to make decisions for them-
selves about what they wish 
to do.”
Casalegno also explained 
why a campuswide email 
was not sent out about this 
incident: “Cases [with] fo-
rensic evidence take time.... 
We were aware of a concern, 
investigation was promptly 
initiated, the individual in-
volved was identi?ed, im-
mediately thereafter left 
campus, and from my van-
tage point at that point, in-
vestigation is important to 
be ongoing so we can bring 
the matter to resolution. But 
the impact or potential risk 
to campus was immediately 
mitigated.”
As for general campus

said not to expect a campus-
wide email regarding the 
situation.
“We don’t routinely send 
campuswide emails about 
any matter that involves the 
con?dential student record, 
and this situation involves 
more than one of those re-
cords. This situation is one 
that involves protecting the 
privacy of individuals, which 
is our utmost concern. If it re-
lates to anything that involves 
the safety of our community 
— if we believe that there is 
any reason the safety of our 
community could be compro-
mised — then we will send a 
campuswide message,” she 
said. “In a case like this one, 
because of the immediacy 
of the former student’s de-
parture from campus, there 
wasn’t a threat to the commu-
nity. There wasn’t a situation 
that we were concerned put 
anybody at risk.”
Casalegno said that on 
Thursday morning when the 
story broke, her of?ce had 
communicated with the resi-
dents of E-Tower to make sure 
that they knew that they had 
a choice to make regarding 
whether or not to speak to the

mitory is a private building 
that the media may not enter.
The university was not 
aware that Jorge was turning 
himself in to the Pennsylva-
nia State Police or would be

When you hear about a 
scienti?c discovery, it usu-
ally comes to you second- or 
even third-hand through 
various news sources. The 
media serves as a middle-
man between scientists and 
the public, and this week, 
Pugwash discussed that 
connection.
The meeting started 
with the question of wheth-
er we thought there were 
problems in the current 
way the media handles sci-
ence. Members were quick 
to point out that there are 
many cases in which the 
media takes a stronger 
stance, exaggerates the re-
sults of certain studies, or 
neglects to report on incon-
clusive results.
For example, in 2011 a 
team of scientists reported 
that they seemed to observe 
subatomic particles travel-
ing faster than the speed of 
light. This result was highly 
anomalous and unexpected, 
as it contradicted Einstein’s 
laws of special relativity. In 
their own publication, the 
researchers reported that 
they were looking for an 
error in their equipment.

Sometimes it is best to 
immediately address the el-
ephant in the room: It’s cold 
outside.
Some public and private 
schools in Pittsburgh were 
closed on Friday not because 
of the potential snow accu-
mulation, but because of the 
bitter cold. A rush of icy arctic 
air caused temperatures from 
the Eastern Seaboard through 
the Midwest to drop to re-
cord lows. Many U.S. cities 
experienced temperatures in 
the negative teens, including 
Pittsburgh. The frigid condi-
tions have had many negative 
impacts, affecting everything 
from air travel to our desire to 
venture outside.
Meteorologists explain the 
most recent drop in tempera-
tures this past week through 
the displacement of the polar 
vortex, a pocket of cold air that 
sits above the polar region.
The Earth contains two po-
lar vortices, one at each pole, 
that are are de?ned as persis-
tent circulations of cold, low-
pressure air that strengthen in 
the winter and weaken in the 
summer. They generally exist 
in the middle to upper tropo-
sphere, the lowest atmospher-
ic layer, and extend into the 
lower stratosphere, the sec-
ond lowest atmospheric layer.
Meteorologists de?ned 
this phenomenon in the early 
1850s, but the term “polar 
vortex” has only recently gar-
nered signi?cant attention. Its 
newfound familiarity, how-
ever, has led to some using the 
term incorrectly to describe all 
Dogs understand and respond to facial expressions
Cognitive scientists at the 
University of Veterinary Medi-
cine Vienna have shown that 
dogs can distinguish between 
happy and angry human faces. 
This is the ?rst study to date 
that credibly demonstrates a 
dog’s ability to differentiate 
human expressions, and the 
results of this study will be 
published in Current Biology.
Photos of happy and angry 
women’s faces were presented 
on a touch screen to 20 dogs. 
Some of the dogs had been 
trained to touch the happy fac-
es, while others were trained 
to touch the angry faces. To 
ensure that the dogs were 
making their decisions based 
on facial expressions and not 
obvious features, such as teeth 
or frown lines, the images 
were split in half during the 
training phase so that the dogs 
only saw either the bottom 
half or the top half of a face at 
once. 
Interestingly, the dogs 
trained to recognize happy 
faces were able to learn more 
quickly than the dogs trained 
to recognize angry faces.

User names found to be the secret to online dating
Sameer Chaudhry, an in-
ternist at the University of 
North Texas, and Khalid Khan, 
professor of women’s health 
and clinical epidemiology at 
Barts and The London School 
of Medicine and Dentistry, 
conducted a study regarding 
the factors that garner success 
in the world of online dating. 
By poring through 86 studies 
on the relationship between 
computer-mediated interac-
tions and in-person dates, 
Chaudhry and Khan discov-
ered that the key to online 
dating is picking the right user 
name. Chaudhry and Kahn 
have concluded that men are 
attracted to usernames re-
lated to physical traits, such 
as “Cutie,” and women are 
attracted to usernames that 
suggest intelligence, such as 
“Cultured.” They also found 
that all users respond positive-
ly to playful names, such as 
“Fun2bwith,” and precedence 
goes to names that begin with 
the ?rst half of the alphabet. 
These ?ndings have been pub-
lished in the journal Evidence 
Based Medicine.

Munchies from marijuana stem from neuroscience
Scientists at Yale Univer-
sity have uncovered the sci-
ence behind why marijuana 
users have food cravings. The 
researchers focused on mol-
ecules called receptors that 
bind to cannabinoids, the ac-
tive ingredient in marijuana. 
They were expecting to ?nd 
that, after binding to canna-
binoids, the receptors would 
send out a signal to subdue 
appetite-suppressing neurons. 
Instead, in an experiment con-
ducted on mice, they found 
that the receptors actually in-
creased the activity of these 
neurons. 
The appetite-suppressing 
neurons began to emit differ-
ent kinds of neurochemicals 
that promote appetite instead, 
thereby causing the munch-
ies. In other words, marijuana 
reverses the function of the 
appetite-suppressing part of 
the brain.
This study has medical 
applications as well, such as 
increasing appetite in cancer 
patients or patients with other 
illnesses that cause the patient 
to lose their appetite.

U.S. approves new genetically modi?ed apples
Despite criticism from op-
ponents of genetically-mod-
i?ed organisms (GMOs), the 
U.S. Department of Agricul-
ture’s Animal and Plant Health 
Inspection Service (APHIS) 
recently approved two geneti-
cally engineered apple variet-
ies. These apples, which were 
developed by the Canadian 
company Okanagan Specialty 
Fruits Inc., will be marketed as 
Arctic Granny and Arctic Gold-
en and were designed to resist 
browning. These apples will 
become available to the public 
in 2016 in small quantities, al-
though it will be several years 
before they become widely 
distributed.
Meanwhile, groups such 
as the Organic Consumers As-
sociation (OCA) are pressur-
ing food companies not to sell 
the fruit. Although Okanagan 
claims the apples have been 
rigorously tested, the OCA is 
still skeptical about their ef-
fects on humans as well as 
ecosystems. The OCA also be-
lieves that genetic manipula-
tion will allow for more pesti-
cide treatment than normal.

Scientists create drug as possible vaccine for HIV
Scientists from the Jupiter, 
Florida campus of The Scripps 
Research Institute (TSRI) 
recently announced the cre-
ation of a new drug candidate 
that could be used as an HIV 
vaccine. 
While the HIV usually fuses 
with the CD4 lymphocyte, an 
important cell in the immune 
system, the novel drug candi-
date developed at TSRI binds 
to two sites on the surface of 
the HIV, preventing it from en-
tering a host cell. 
The drug has potential as a 
vaccine namely due to its uni-
versiality. The drug was shown 
to be effective against every 
strain of HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIV 
(Simian Immunode?ciency 
Virus) that has been isolated 
from humans and rhesus ma-
caques, a species of monkey. 
The drug also appears to work 
for at least eight months after 
injection.
The work was supported 
by the National Institutes of 
Health, and the study was 
published last Wednesday in 
the journal Nature.

Telescopic contact lenses improve modern ocular care
Swedish optics research-
ers recently presented a new 
type of contact lens at the 
American Association for the 
Advancement of Science’s an-
nual meeting. 
These novel contact lenses 
have the capability to zoom in 
on objects, magnifying them 
up to 2.8 times. The lenses are 
paired with electronic glasses 
that respond to winks from the 
user. Winking one eye causes a 
polarized ?lter in the glasses 
to direct light into the zoom-
ing section of the contact lens; 
winking the other eye causes 
light to pass through regularly, 
returning vision back to nor-
mal. Eye irritation is reduced 
by air channels that allow oxy-
gen to reach the underside of 
the contact lens. 
These contacts lenses have 
the potential to help patients 
with macular degeneration, a 
major cause of blindness and 
visual impairment from old 
age. These contacts have cur-
rently only been tested on me-
chanical models.

Carnegie Mellon’s Human 
Computer Interaction Institute 
hosted a lecture by Gerhard 
Fischer, a professor in the De-
partment of Computer Science 
and director of the Center for 
Lifelong Learning and Design 
at the University of Colora-
do Boulder last Wednesday. 
Fischer presented his talk on 
Massively Open Online Cours-
es (MOOCs) and their impacts 
on the structure of education 
in the future. His research pre-
dominantly tries to develop  
“a more theoretical grounded 
view of what MOOCs are and 
what they can be.”
In the fall of 2011, two pro-
fessors from Stanford Univer-
sity, Sebastian Thrun and Pe-
ter Norvig, offered interactive 
webcasts to their “Introduc-
tion to Arti?cial Intelligence” 
class. Only 175 students physi-
cally attended the lectures at 
Stanford, but over 100,000 vir-
tual users participated in this 
academic activity. Although 
the concept of Massively Open 
Online Courses (MOOCs) had 
been introduced in 2008, Nor-
vig and Thrun popularized 
this concept that now spans 
over six thousand free and ac-
cessible online classes.
As MOOCs gained popu-
larity over the past two years, 
more universities showed in-
creasing support of them. If 
a professor chooses to offer 
his or her class to the open 
environment of the internet, 
companies such as Udacity, 
Coursera, and EdX serve as 
platforms for professors to 
present class materials to in-
terested candidates. As com-
panies that serve as vehicles 
to MOOCs gained promi-
nence, prestigious universi-
ties all over the nation more 
willingly assisted in their de-
velopments. The balance of 
the two kinds of institutions 
continually pushed forward 
the developments of MOOCs.

Science in the Media
PUGWASH
There are 
many cases 
in which the 
media takes 
a stronger 
stance, 
exaggerates 
the results 
of certain 
studies, or 
neglects to 
report on 
inconclusive 
results.

sources spread the news that 
special relativity was on the 
rocks. Headlines announced 
that “Particles break light-
speed limit,” a much stronger 
assertion than the scientists 
themselves made. It turned 
out the equipment was faulty 
after all, but the media had al-
ready spread the (false) news 
that there were faster-than-
light particles.
A member of Pugwash 
brought up that news sources 
can’t be expected to be experts 
in every ?eld, and they only 
have a limited amount of space 
to represent new scienti?c dis-
coveries. A 15-second sound 
bite might not be enough to 
explain all the nuances, and 
the public should rely on long-
form journalism to give a more 
accurate picture, instead of 
the morning news roundup.
Something else that makes 
portraying scienti?c results 
accurately dif?cult is the sta-
tistical idea of certainty. Most 
studies are held with 95 per-
cent certainty, which sounds 
pretty good. However, that ?ve 
percent can cause problems. If 
you do 20 studies on the same 
problem, and each study is 
done at 95 percent certainty, 
then one study (one-twenti-
eth, or 5 percent) will gener-
ally report faulty results.
 In a ?eld like climate sci-
ence, there are enough stud-
ies being done that some are 
showing that there is no cli-
mate change. It is generally 
accepted in the scienti?c com-
munity that these results are 
part of the 5 percent, because 
there are many other studies. 
However, because news sto-
ries are usually about single 
studies, they often miss the 
larger picture, and do not cov-
er the entire body of research 
that has been done on the 
topic. It is more interesting to 
report on a controversy or an 
outlier, even if it isn’t statisti-
cally signi?cant.
Some of the issues of media 
portrayal of science also come 
from the media’s mission: Is it 
truth, or is it entertainment? 
If it is truth, then they have a 
responsibility to dig into the 
reasons why outlying stud-
ies might be mistaken, and 
to always report on new and 
exciting studies in the context 
of the past work that has been 
done in the ?eld. 
However, most members 
felt that problems arise when 
the media’s goal shifts towards 
entertainment, which means 
results are exaggerated and 
given more weight than they 
may actually have.
One ?nal topic revolved 
around the portrayal of sci-
entists themselves, instead of 
their studies. In many cases, 
scientists are shown as a sepa-
rate class who are unable to 
connect with regular people. 
Shows like The Big Bang The-
ory reinforce the idea that the 
scientists are all socially inept 
geniuses. 
It is true that teaching or 
communicating is a separate 
skill from actually doing sci-
ence, and that some really 
great researchers are terrible 
professors. However, there 
are people who can do both, 
like Neil deGrasse Tyson. If the 
scienti?c community wants 
their image to improve and for 
science to be communicated 
more accurately, it is up to 
the community to make those 
changes.
interested in rethinking and 
envisioning what learning in 
education in the 21st century 
might be,” Fischer said. “I 
think that schools will not go 
away, but we may rethink the 
function of schools in such 
an environment since online 
activities have become very 
prominent.”
Fischer’s focus on MOOCs 
relates to the concept of a 
“?ipped classroom.” Instead 
of a traditional classroom set-
ting where students attend 
lectures to learn the material 
needed for a set curriculum, 
?ipped classrooms reverse 
the roles in the sense that the 
understanding of a subject 
based on learning materials 
has already been achieved be-
fore class. Then, when class 
actually takes place, the pro-
fessor can interact with stu-
dents based on a discussion-
type learning. With MOOCs, 
well-known academic sourc-
es can be distributed to stu-
dents as a resource to learn 
before class. 
Because MOOCs take on a 
more technological and inno-
vative shape, many students 
seem to prefer the incorpo-
ration of MOOCs outside of 
classes to mere traditional 
papers and textbooks.
Fischer has conducted the 
last ten years of his research 
while keeping in mind the 
concept of ?ipped classrooms. 
His ?ndings derive from his 
own experiences as a profes-
sor and his desire to motivate 
students to engage in classes. 
“I would give them small as-
signments beforehand, for 
example, a paper to read on a 
certain subject,” Fischer said. 
“I would then ask them to 
consider the strengths, weak-
nesses, and the most interest-
ing ideas of the topic.” 
Fischer would then create 
a course information environ-
ment where students would 
share their own thoughts. 
Instead of spending the ?rst 
few minutes in class study-
ing this material, he would 
extract the most interesting 
comments from his students 
and put them on slides so 
that class time could be spent 
on discussing more contro-
versial issues. “I found that 
this method was considerably 
more effort, and I found that 
the students get more out of 
it,” Fischer said.
Despite their bene?ts, 
MOOCs are often criticized 
due to their association with 
high dropout rates. About 90 
percent of the people who sign 
up for these online classes 
end up not completing them. 
However, the important mes-
sage that Fischer wishes to re-
inforce is that MOOCs impact 
a considerably larger number 
of students than regular uni-
versities do. Although the re-
tention rate may be low, the 
actual amount of students 
that they impact is rather im-
pressive.
Many students in these 
courses drop out because 
MOOCs are seen as less 
legitimate by many entities. 
When asked about the legiti-
mization of MOOCs onto the 
same platforms of universi-
ties in the future, Fischer re-
sponded, “How these things 
will develop is at this moment 
unclear, but I would include 
institutions offering MOOCs 
?nding ways to make their 
educational efforts more le-
gitimate and veri?able.” His 
research has found that the 
“self-motivational” qualities 
of completing MOOCs attract 
certain professionals in in-
dustries, but, as of right now, 
the credentials gained from 
MOOCs are not as accept-
able as actual degrees from 
universities.
As technology advances 
the way society approaches 
education, researchers and 
professors continue to seek 
out new methods of commu-
nicating and learning. Cur-
rently, MOOCs have gained 
momentum from only a few 
years of prominence, and it 
is clear that the future land-
scape of education will con-
tinue to adapt to develop-
ments involving MOOCs.

This month, senior mathe-
matical sciences major Tomer 
Reiter was selected to study at 
the University of Cambridge 
in England as a 2015 recipi-
ent of the Gates Cambridge 
Scholarship, one of the most 
prestigious international 
scholarships.
The Gates Cambridge 
Scholarships program was es-
tablished in 2000 by a dona-
tion of 210 million dollars to 
the University of Cambridge 
from the Bill and Melinda 
Gates Foundation, the largest 
single donation to any univer-
sity in the United Kingdom. 
Students are selected based 
on their outstanding intel-
lectual ability, leadership po-
tential, and commitment to 
improving the lives of others. 
Students awarded this schol-
arship study a vast range of 
subjects at the University of 
Cambridge, and alumni of the 
program take on leadership 
roles and apply their knowl-
edge and skills to better the 
lives of others.
Reiter is the second Carn-
egie Mellon student to receive 
a Gates Cambridge Schol-
arship. “Carnegie Mellon 
seemed like a great place to 
be if you wanted to do math-
ematics. After I got here, I 
found that this was de?nitely 
the case,” Reiter said in an 
interview with Jocelyn Duffy, 
Director of Media Relations at 
the Mellon College of Science. 
“Math is beautiful. One of the 
most satisfying things is when 
you have a strong intuition 
about why a statement should 
be true, and you ?nally ?nd 
a proof,” Reiter said. “Carn-
egie Mellon has taught me 
how to tackle those dif?cult 
problems.”
At Cambridge, Reiter 
will complete a one-year 
course called “Part III of the 
Mathematical Tripos” to ob-
tain a Master of Advanced 
Study degree in pure math-
ematics. Afterward, Reiter 
plans on returning to the Unit-
ed States to pursue a doctoral 
degree in mathematics.
Reiter, who was born in 
Israel and raised in Newton, 
Mass., discovered his love of 
mathematics while attending 
the Program in Mathematics 
for Young Scientists (PRO-
MYS). PROMYS is a six-week 
summer program in Boston 
where high school students 
learn about mathematics, 
speci?cally number theory. 
“I found my passion for 
number theory and mathe-
matics at PROMYS. I returned 
as a counselor and eventu-
ally served as head counselor. 
Through this I realized how 
excited I am to mentor and 
teach mathematics,” Reiter 
said in his scholarship pro?le. 
“At Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity, I completed a major in 
mathematics and minor in 
computer science, further 
fueling my interest in math-
ematics and mentoring.”
Reiter hopes to one day 
become a professor. “All the 
while, I hope to make contri-
butions through teaching and 
mentoring, just as PROMYS 
has made an impact on me,” 
Reiter said.
Along with completing a 
major in mathematics and a 
minor in computer science, 
Reiter is a former president 
and former philanthropy 
chair of Alpha Epsilon Pi Fra-
ternity, studies Japanese, and 
is a part of the Math Club.

severe drops in temperature 
in the United States. Under-
standing a polar vortex can 
help explain how a polar vor-
tex may contribute to some of 
the lower temperatures such 
as the drop we all recently ex-
perienced.
The northern and south-
ern polar vortices are slightly 
different; the air in the north 
generally circulates in a coun-
ter-clockwise fashion, while 
the air in the south rotates 
clockwise. 
In addition, the south-
ern polar vortex is larger 
and more powerful than its 
northern counterpart. The 
presence of more landmasses 
and a larger land-sea contrast 
in the north results in large-
scale waves that move upward 
from the troposphere to the 
stratosphere, erode the vor-
tex, and increase its internal 
temperature.
The northern polar vor-
tex is circled by a strong west 
to east jet stream referred to 
as the polar night jet. This jet 
stream separates the polar 
region from the midlatitudes, 
acting as a barrier that keeps 
the polar vortex from shifting 
downwards. Occasionally, un-
stable planetary waves in the 
early winter can cause the po-
lar air to break the barrier and 
mix with the midlatitudes, 
causing cooling.
Conversely, the current 
cooling phenomenon is due 
to the natural warming cycle 
of the polar vortex that leads 
to its eventual breakup. As 
the earth begins its transition 
from winter to spring, the 
?rst warming period occurs 
between late February to mid-
March. 
This warming causes a 
piece of the polar vortex to 
break-off, displace the polar 
night jet, and plunge into Can-
ada and a large portion of the 
United States.
This, however, is not a very 
common event for several rea-
sons. First, it is not very likely 
for cold air to push past a pow-
erful jet stream. Second, the 
chuck of the vortex that splits 
off must be large enough to 
cover a wide portion of land 
in order for us to see effects 
in the Northeastern United 
States. The occurrence of both 
of these factors is considered 
an anomaly of stratospheric 
circulation.
Research is currently ongo-
ing to explore whether global 
warming may play a role in an 
increased frequency of polar 
bursts into the midlatitudes. 
A rise in the earth’s tempera-
ture is already known to pro-
duce anomalies such as the 
distortion of the jet stream, 
which allows the polar vortex 
to escape. Current scienti?c 
observations regarding this 
phenomenon are considered 
short-term, starting only 13 
years ago. In order to make 
con?dent conclusions, scien-
tists need several decades of 
data to distinguish between 
natural variability and climate 
trends.
The polar vortex is an in-
triguing concept for climatolo-
gists, not due to its potential to 
deliver us cold air, but because 
its presence can have a nega-
tive effect on the ozone layer. 
The ozone layer is found in 
the stratosphere and plays a 
large role in shielding us from 
potentially harmful ultraviolet 
rays from the sun.
 As temperatures drop in 
the polar vortex, polar strato-
spheric clouds form. Chemical 
reactions on these clouds due 
to the presence of of chloro-
?uorocarbons (CFCs) release 
chlorine that can rapidly de-
stroy ozone.
Over the past several years, 
the polar vortex has made it-
self more relevant and moved 
beyond purely scienti?c im-
portance by sneaking into the 
midlatitudes and impacting 
the public’s way of life in the 
Northeastern United States.

Mars One, a non-pro?t organiza-
tion founded in 2011, has pledged to 
create and populate a settlement on 
Mars. Mars One will launch crews of 
four settlers every two years starting 
in 2024, after a series of unmanned 
missions starting in 2018 intended to 
give the astronauts the supplies they 
need to found the colony. According 
to its website, Mars One started the 
search for colonizers in April 2013 
and received over 200,000 applica-
tions in their ?rst round.
We already know a lot about the 
Red Planet — there have been four 
robotic rovers successfully launched 
to Mars, most recently Curiosity. 
From this research, we know that 
Mars — the fourth planet from the 
sun — has a rocky surface covered 
mostly in iron oxide (rust) with an 
atmosphere almost completely made 
up of carbon dioxide. While these 
conditions cannot foster human life, 
or life of any kind, Mars One claims 
that current technology can support 
a colony on Mars.
The idea of a human colony on 
another planet is exciting and could 
present a major opportunity for the 
human race. However, it is also a 
prospect fraught with unknowns. 
The colonization process will be 
broadcast as a reality TV show, ac-
cording to Mars One, raising a host 
of ethical dilemmas: Does this mis-
sion prioritize entertainment value 
over science and research? What if 
people die, a very real possibility in 
a foreign environment so hostile to 
human life?
While Mars One’s mission could 
have enormous value and unprec-
edented impact on the human race, 
the voyeurism inherent in using 
the mission as entertainment raises 
some qualms. 
Mars One should be cautious 
moving forward, and take care that 
the so-called “Mars One Hundred” — 
those selected to start the colony on 
Mars — are prepared for their jour-
ney and the many dangers intrinsic 
to it.
Mars colony has potential, but caution still advised
John Oliver rightly spotlights bully tobacco industry
U.S. aid to Ukraine should not be given thoughtlessly
Since Russia’s formal annexation 
of Crimea last March, the United 
States has had a tenuous stance on 
intervention in Ukraine. It has been 
easy to characterize Russian Presi-
dent Vladimir Putin as a bully in 
these proceedings, but there looms 
a greater worry: Could Ukraine be-
come a symbol for international con-
?ict in a new Cold War between the 
United States and Russia?
The cease?re last week failed 
even as it was being signed, with 
?ghting continuing in Eastern 
Ukraine. This region has generally 
separatist sympathies. Ukrainian 
troops are withdrawing from the city 
of Debaltseve, which has been under 
siege for weeks. Now Ukrainians are 
requesting U.N. Peacekeepers, while 
Russia maintains that U.N. involve-
ment would violate the terms of the 
cease?re.
Assisting the Ukrainian rebels 
has its own complications. Failures 
like Korea, Vietnam, and Iraq have 
shown that American intervention 
is often unwanted and unhelpful in 
international civil con?icts. More 
recently, the Arab Spring has shown 
just how complex and challenging 
international intervention may be-
come. Dictators are easy targets, but 
establishing a new system of gover-
nance in a country without a history 
of democracy is much more dif?cult.
One of the most salient fears 
about assisting the Ukrainian reb-
els is weapons possession. President 
Barack Obama has said that the 
United States is considering “lethal 
defensive weapons” if diplomacy 
fails. Should the United States con-
sider this strategy that has failed in 
other con?icts? 
The Tartan agrees that a diplo-
matic solution is still ideal, but it 
seems to be increasingly unlikely. 
American aid to Ukraine is a calcu-
lated step that should be approached 
with caution.
On Feb. 15, John Oliver turned 
his attention to the tobacco industry 
on his show Last Week Tonight with 
John Oliver.
The host criticized major corpo-
rations, particularly Philip Morris 
International and British Ameri-
can Tobacco, for threatening to sue 
smaller nations trying to pass public 
health laws that would help reduce 
smoking rates. These laws include 
“plain packaging laws” that replace 
logos and other trademarks on ciga-
rette packaging with clear warnings 
and graphic illustrations of health 
problems that arise from smoking 
tobacco.
In 2011, Australia introduced 
plain packaging laws that banned 
company branding from tobacco 
packages and included what Oliver 
could only refer to as “upsetting pho-
tos.” The photos depict a toe-tag on a 
corpse, a cancerous mouth, a “night-
marish” eyeball, and a diseased lung. 
The purpose of these images is to de-
ter people from purchasing or using 
tobacco products, and with good rea-
son. According to the World Health 
Organization, nearly six million 
people die annually from tobacco-
related causes.
Total consumption of tobacco and 
cigarettes in Australia fell to record 
lows since these laws were imple-
mented. To achieve this feat, the 
Australian government had to deal 
with a number of lawsuits from to-
bacco companies: two sued Austra-
lia’s highest court in an attempt to 
stop plain packaging laws. In 2012, 
the high court tossed the case and re-
quired the companies to pay all legal 
costs associated with the case.
However, rather than abiding 
by the court’s decision, the tobacco 
companies have aggressively tried 
to prevent smaller countries from 
adopting legislation similar to Aus-
trailia’s. At least four countries — 
Namibia, Gabon, Togo, and Uganda 
— have received warnings from 
large tobacco corporations. Philip 
Morris threatened to sue Togo, one 
of the 10 poorest countries on earth, 
after the country’s government re-
quired packs of cigarettes to include 
written warnings about the health 
risks of smoking. Only 40 percent of 
Togo’s adult population is literate. 
Furthermore, Philip Morris had net 
revenues of over $80 billion in 2013, 
while Togo’s GDP estimated just a 
little over $4 billion the same year.
This form of intimidation by the 
tobacco industry toward smaller 
countries is unacceptable. As smok-
ing rates in these nations increase 
and become major public health con-
cerns, John Oliver’s initiative to im-
prove the situation is both admirable 
and just.

The ?rst time I heard about 
ABC’s new show Fresh Off the Boat, 
I cringed.
For years, “fresh off the boat” 
has been used as a degrading term 
for Asians who don’t quite ?t in 
with American culture. “Fresh off 
the boat” was something you would 
never want to be. When I heard 
about the new ABC sitcom I thought, 
“Great, another excuse for people to 
make Asian jokes.”
But after reading a couple posi-
tive reviews and an interview with 
Constance Wu, who plays the main 
character’s mother Jessica on Fresh 
Off the Boat, I relented and watched 
two episodes. And, to my surprise, 
the show hit home.
Here’s the thing: You don’t see a 
lot of Asian-American families por-
trayed on American television. In 
fact, the last American television 
show that focused on an Asian fami-
ly was comedian Margaret Cho’s All-
American Girl, which was received 
so poorly that it was canceled before 
I was even born.
Fresh Off the Boat depicts aspects 
of my childhood, as well as that of 
many other Asian-Americans, that 
I’d never seen on television before. 
Serious scenes scattered through-
out are all too familiar: when Eddie 
Huang, the main character of the 
show, is excommunicated from a 
table of cool, white kids because of 
the way his home-cooked meal looks 
and smells; the racial slur another 
kid throws at Eddie in the middle 
the lunchroom; when Jessica, Ed-
die’s mother, smiles through her 
so-called friends’ racist remarks to 
avoid seeming like a stickler.
Of course, there are also some 
relatable, comedic scenes, such as 
Eddie having a dif?cult time ?tting 
in at school, while his siblings seem 
to effortlessly rise to the top of their 
own social ranks or Jessica taking a 
whole bowl of chips in a supermar-
ket because she misunderstands the 
concept of free samples.
While these scenes aren’t exactly 
how my childhood panned out, see-
ing characters experience some-
thing similar to my experience on 
television is important. In the words 
of Constance Wu: “To see Asians in 
leading roles changes what I’m call-
ing the heteronormative status of 
TV.”
Fresh Off the Boat isn’t perfect. 
Eddie Huang, whose Fresh Off the 
Boat: A Memoir inspired the sitcom, 
has gone on record to criticize the 
show and how the producers stray 
from his original story, and even 
how they water down his life story. 
Other critics have called Jessica’s ac-
cent and jokes stereotypical.
But the show reaches out to an 
important audience of American 
television that has been ignored 
for a long time. Accents are part of 
the reality that people assimilating 
into American culture must experi-
ence. They’re natural consequences 
of learning another language, and 
oftentimes an impressive sign that 
someone is familiar with more than 
one language.
There are no stereotypes in the 
show; stereotypes are harmful and 
oversimpli?ed. What we see on 
screen are real characters who face 
dif?culty when put in an unfamiliar 
situation. What we see on screen are 
real characters who minorities, long 
ignored in the American television 
industry, can relate to. 
Of course, not everyone’s stories 
are the same, but being able to em-
pathize with a character onscreen 
who isn’t white and has shared even 
remotely similar experiences makes 
a difference.
For the ?rst time in years, Asian-
American minorities have been giv-
en a major voice on television. Fresh 
Off the Boat is an important step in 
allowing unique, non-white voices 
and stories to be heard.

Oklahoma’s revision of history is the opposite of patriotic
SARAH GUTEKUNST
Operations Manager
This week, the legislative commit-
tee on education in Oklahoma voted 
to ban Advanced Placement (AP) 
United States History. Since the Col-
lege Board updated the curriculum 
for the course in the middle of 2014, 
Republican lawmaker and the bill’s 
sponsor Dan Fischer has claimed 
that the curriculum is too critical of 
America. His bill, in addition to the 
ban, proposes a new curriculum for 
American history courses in Okla-
homa that aims to promote a more 
“patriotic” memory.
Fischer says that under the new 
AP curriculum, the emphasis is “on 
America as a nation of oppressors 
and exploiters,” and his proposal 
for a new educational framework 
promotes a more positive spin on 
American history. The proposal also 
mandates the inclusion of the Ten 
Commandments, “Sinners in the 
Hands of an Angry God,” three sepa-
rate speeches by Ronald Reagan, and 
George W. Bush’s speech immedi-
ately following the attacks of Sept. 
11, 2001.
 According to the bill, any school 
not in compliance with the new cur-
riculum during the 2014-2015 school 
year will not receive Oklahoma state 
funding for their programs. 
Many critics of the AP framework 
claim that it includes a liberal slant 
and denounce it for politicizing his-
tory. However, this counter-proposal 
is truly no better, as it undeniably 
has its own biases. Not only is there 
a conservative slant, but also a reli-
gious one.
Representative Fischer is a mem-
ber of the Black Robe Regiment. 
This is a group of Americans named 
after ministers from the colonial era 
whose mission is to end the division 
between Church and State. The foun-
dation of this belief goes back to pre-
Revolutionary history. They claim 
that, at America’s conception, these 
two entities were fundamentally con-
nected, and the activism of ministers 
helped Americans win independence 
when political efforts failed.
Therefore, since our nation’s ex-
istence is thanks to these ministers, 
the Church should regain the same 
in?uence it had during the Revolu-
tion. One of their missions, as stated 
on their web page, is “to provide 
educational materials for use in the 
Church and for the American Public 
to restore our American History and 
the History of the American Church, 
so as to restore what has been lost 
by way of deception and historical 
revision.”
Even though the Americans that 
fought for and won independence 
were religious people, they left Eng-
land in order to escape religious op-
pression. They wanted independence 
from a monarchical government so 
that they could form a decentralized 
government with increased liberties.
The idea of American Exception-
alism is based heavily on our nation’s 
freedoms, guaranteed by our consti-
tution. They are not just freedoms; 
they are rights that all American 
people are entitled to. Fan favorites 
include free speech, freedom to bear 
arms, freedom to a fair trial, and free-
dom from illegal search and seizure. 
But what about our First Amendment 
right to speak freely about our griev-
ances against the government?
Being proud to be an American 
does not require us as citizens to 
pledge blind allegiance. It is possible 
to be patriotic and still have a critical 
understanding of what our history 
truly looks like. The AP U.S. History 
framework encourages students to 
look at the events that compose our 
full timeline from an objective per-
spective, allowing students to see 
what has worked for the nation and 
what has set us back. This is an in-
vestment in our political future. If 
students were to learn a whitewashed 
version of history that lacks the truth, 
they cannot be expected to grow up 
and become effective citizens. Their 
understanding of cause and effect 
in the context of history wouldn’t be 
realistic. The implication that this bill 
has for our freedom is tremendous. 
Because these lawmakers believe 
that being critical of America’s past is 
a bad thing, they’re effectively taking 
away students’ rights to speak openly 
about America. 
Historical revisionism is a tactic 
that has been used effectively by na-
tions such as Nazi Germany, Soviet 
Russia, North Korea, and Serbia. It’s 
a propaganda tactic that uses decep-
tion to essentially brainwash citizens 
into believing whatever version of 
history is most convenient to the 
ruling party.
What’s at risk here is much big-
ger than just education reform; it’s 
our free will. As Americans who sup-
port educational freedom, we need 
to stand up to legislation like this. It 
is our right to have access to history 
that is correct and will bene?t us as 
critical thinkers, and it is my hope 
that this bill will not survive the legis-
lative process.
Deregulate drones to avoid dystopia
JUSTIN MCGOWN 
Robotics in general, and drones in 
particular, are becoming not the stuff 
of science ?ction but of everyday life. 
However, it seems that we are at a 
crossroads both in the development 
of this technology and the laws sur-
rounding its use. In science ?ction, 
drones are almost always just tools. 
However, the United States’ current 
drone record suggests a future dysto-
pia with a sky full of relentless kill-
droids rather than a utopia full of 
helpful robots making deliveries and 
watching over crops.
This may sound like hyperbole, 
but two important developments oc-
curred last week, both of which are 
poised to change the way American 
drones are sold and used. First, the 
Federal Aviation Administration 
(FAA) issued a report detailing a pro-
posal for overly restrictive rules on 
the private use of drones. The FAA 
would require drones used by civil-
ians to remain below 500 feet and in 
visual range of a fully-in-control op-
erator at all times.
While ?ying devices need rules 
and regulations for the safety of the 
general public, the FAA’s proposal 
would prevent most drone-related 
businesses or services from taking 
off, especially since recreational use 
of radio control (RC) planes and 
non-professional drone use remains 
unrestricted for unmanned aerial ve-
hicles (UAVs) under 55 pounds.
Delivery drones would have to 
routinely be out of visual range of 
an operator, and the proposed rules 
make no allowance for the use of 
GPS or camera systems to make up 
for being outside of visual range. 
While a height ceiling is necessary, 
especially when the drone may be 
near manned aircraft, 500 feet is a 
relatively low ceiling and may inter-
fere with the proposed use of drones 
to monitor large crop ?elds for signs 
of disease or drought.
While the FAA was proposing a 
potentially too-tight set of rules for 
domestic drone operators to adhere 
to, just a few days later the State De-
partment announced a handful of 
restrictions on the export of armed 
drones to allied nations. While drone 
technology has been independently 
developed in many countries, and 
numerous unarmed drones are ex-
ported by the United States and 
other countries, armed American 
drones such as the MQ-9 Predator 
remain the most battle-tested and 
?eld-proven options.
Drones are much cheaper to pur-
chase and to operate than conven-
tional aircraft, and the investment 
in training a pilot isn’t lost when-
ever one is shot down. Like it or not, 
drones are an important emerging 
tool in warfare, and exporting armed 
drones is in some ways very similar 
to other military technology. Howev-
er, the State Department guidelines 
indicate that drones can only be sold 
to nations that will not use them in 
unlawful circumstances — an inter-
esting development given our cur-
rent government’s penchant for ille-
gal drone use.
There is little doubt that drone 
technology will become widespread 
in the near future, and that society 
will be changed in both positive and 
negative ways by its presence. But 
when it comes to directing techno-
logical developments and society’s 
use of drone technology, the govern-
ment needs to devote more atten-
tion to creating an environment that 
allows Americans to bene?t from 
drones, rather than making it easi-
er for foreign governments to ?ght 
their wars.

Parks ends, but Leslie will stay feminist hero
AMELIA BRITTON
Tuesday marks the series ?nale 
of Parks and Recreation on NBC, and 
I’ll be very sorry to say goodbye to 
Leslie Knope (Amy Poehler). While 
Parks and Rec has a strong ensemble 
cast and witty writing, it is Leslie’s 
strength that drives the show. The 
town of Pawnee, Indiana is ?awed 
and absurd, but Leslie shows us 
what a feminist can look like in 21st 
Century middle America.
Initial reviews of the show con-
strued Leslie as ditzy, but show writ-
ers quickly corrected that percep-
tion. By the third season, Leslie had 
earned our respect as a smart, tal-
ented, impressive woman. The show 
has continued to grow in popularity, 
with icons like Ron Swanson. While 
I adore Ron, you can’t talk about 
Parks and Recreation without talking 
about Leslie Knope. While Ron ad-
vises to “never half-ass two things, 
whole-ass one thing,” Leslie “whole-
asses” everything she does.
Leslie is unapologetic in her pur-
suits. She typi?es servant leadership 
as a member of the local parks de-
partment, then as a city councilor, 
and eventually as the head of the 
National Parks Service in the Mid-
west. Her progression is met with 
adversity and small defeats, but she 
deals with obstacles as they appear. 
She perseveres in the face of work-
place sexism. The show doesn’t shy 
away from dif?cult topics, like the 
racist murals on the walls of city hall 
that were some of my favorite recur-
ring items in its ?rst two seasons.
This ?nal season takes place in 
2017, a 3-year jump from the end 
of season six. Leslie has had trip-
lets in the meantime (named after 
Supreme Court justices!), but the 
season is not about Leslie’s struggle 
balancing family with her career. 
She acknowledges it, but the season 
arc is more about Leslie’s work and 
friends. Motherhood becomes a part 
of who she is, and not a de?nition of 
what she is. When Ben launches a 
campaign for Congress, the pair rec-
ognizes the ridiculous cultural ex-
pectations related to the “campaign 
wife” image, and instead maintains 
their egalitarian relationship dy-
namic.
As a human being, Leslie is 
?awed. Over the course of the se-
ries, we learn that her home is a 
“scary hoarder’s nest” and that she 
has neurotic tendencies about bind-
ers. Sometimes her insanely high 
standards are unfairly projected 
onto others. What makes Leslie ad-
mirable is that she attains profes-
sional success while maintaining 
her status a real person. She is un-
ashamed of her love for breakfast 
food and has a wall of inspirational 
women in her of?ce. These hidden 
passions make Leslie’s enthusiasm 
seem a little less exhausting and a 
lot more believable.
Leslie supports her lady friends, 
and not just on Galentine’s Day. She 
?ghts for their happiness in a way 
that television shows rarely display, 
instead preferring the jealousy nar-
rative or putting women into stereo-
typed supporting roles. In my own 
life, female best friends have been 
irreplaceable bastions of support. 
It is reassuring that Leslie is never 
self-conscious about showing her af-
fection for her best friend or hoping 
that it is reciprocated. The devotion 
between Leslie and Ann (Rashida 
Jones) is immensely validating.
Other women on the show dem-
onstrate that empowerment can 
mean something unique for every-
one. Donna (Retta) pursues business 
ownership while recognizing the im-
portance of taking time to “treat yo’ 
self.” April’s (Aubrey Plaza) façade 
of hating the world actually demon-
strates how ?ercely she feels about 
those she loves. Just as importantly, 
the men on the show recognize the 
power of the women in their lives. 
They support them as individuals, 
not as objects or inferiors.
Most importantly, Leslie Knope 
exempli?es the modern feminist. 
She is aggressive and passion-
ate, but as a #bossbitch and not a 
#bitchboss (to use Donna’s turn 
of phrase). She is an actual boss — 
people report to her and respect her 
ideas. She surrounds herself with a 
team that respects her as a human 
being. She is the hardest worker in 
Pawnee and loves what she does. 
Still, she asks us to remember what’s 
important in life: “Friends, waf?es, 
work. Or waf?es, friends, work. But 
work is third.” Goodbye, Leslie. Ova-
ries before brovaries.

Friends, Liberals, Progressives,
Last week, President Obama 
asked Congress for war powers to 
combat in Iraq and Syria. Last week, 
I also participated in a discussion — 
“Nonviolence and Social Change” — 
in which humanists at Carnegie Mel-
lon arrived short of committing to 
nonviolence, accepting instead that 
violence can be needed.
This is hardly insulated. Who 
right now is committed to non-
violence, opposes war, and is pro-
peace? We all did detest the War in 
Iraq once, and not without cause. 
What cause withholds us then from 
still detesting it?
The multi-nationality of our co-
alition? On Feb. 6, the Jordanian 
bombs killed as indiscriminately as 
ours. The limited, pointedness of 
our efforts? On Feb. 15, no precision 
bombing in Iraq was able to prevent 
atrocities in Libya.
Is ISIS more threatening to the 
United States and more brutal than 
Saddam Hussein? Hardly — only 
more public. The politics, party, or 
prizes of the new commander-in-
chief? I hope not.
Violence does not prevent vio-
lence. Do two decades of continuous 
war against these people not illus-
trate this? Violence only causes more 
violence. 
Do the atrocities in every day’s 
headlines not illustrate this? The 
question is not, “How do we destroy 
violence?” but rather, “What causes 
these atrocities?”
I was born in 1996. In 1990, they 
had bombed my uncle. In 1998, they 
bombed my older brother. In 2003, 
they bombed my school. But they 
stuck around, so I trusted them, 
even though they killed two people 
from my church. In 2011, they left 
and things only got worse. And now 
they’re bombing us again? I’m 19, 
Iraqi, I know death from them, and I 
hate them for it.
If humanists do not sympathize 
with our fellow humans, who will? If 
liberals don’t resist the force of vio-
lence, who will? If progressives re-
vert to war, who will lead the peace?
We say the words. On Jan 19, we 
said: “Hate cannot drive out hate: 
only love can do that.” On Oct 2, we 
said: “My religion is based on truth 
and non-violence.” On Sept. 2, 2013, 
we said: “War never again! Never 
again war!” On July 3, 2008, we said: 
“I am absolutely committed to end-
ing this war.”
If we are anti-war, let us be anti-
this war. If we are non-violent, let us 
be against this violence. And if we 
are pro-peace, let us be peaceful.
End this War!

Russell Westbrook wins MVP, leads West to All-Star win
SPORTS COMMENTARY
ANDY BIRLA
Junior Staffwriter
Last weekend was an ex-
tremely special one for the 
world. It was one of the few 
times in the year when passion 
rose above all and freakishly 
scary things happened. Last 
weekend was the “All-Star 
Weekend” for the National 
Basketball Association (NBA) 
— not to mention Valentine’s 
Day and Friday the 13th. Our 
story begins on Sunday night: 
Up until that point, the West 
had dominated the weekend, 
with Golden State Warriors 
guard Stephen Curry win-
ning the Three-Point Con-
test, Houston Rockets guard 
Patrick Beverley trumping 
the Skills Challenge and Min-
nesota Timberwolves guard 
Zach LaVine conquering the 
Slam Dunk Contest. The East 
had one more chance to come 
out of the weekend with some 
dignity and silverware — the 
All-Star Game.
The fascination surround-
ing the All-Star Game is cap-
tured best by the words of the 
Western Conference Coach 
Steve Kerr. “What I was think-
ing today was just how cool 
it is for each one of you: your 
own unique story and how you 
got here and for the next cou-
ple of hours here we are in the 
Mecca, the Garden, and this is 
what it is all about.”
The stage was set for an 
iconic game. To heighten the 
magic of the moment, Pau 
and Marc Gasol, brothers and 
centers for the Chicago Bulls 
and Memphis grizzlies respec-
tively, would make history by 
being the ?rst brothers to start 
an All-Star game and face each 
other at the tipoff.
Coach Kerr told his play-
ers exactly how the ?rst play 
would be: “One of you guys 
get it and like throw it to one 
of the other guys and then 
you throw it to someone else 
and then you shoot.” Funnily 
enough, that’s what it was all 
game long. Having players of 
such stature compete on such 
a glori?ed ?eld, nobody is in-
terested in strategic plays or 
pressuring defense. The focus 
instead is on a ?amboyant of-
fense, and this game would 
have no shortage of that.
The East was putting on a 
show with the likes of Cleve-
land Cavaliers point guard 
Kyrie Irving, Cavaliers small 
forward LeBron James and 
Washington Wizards point 
guard John Wall. It hardly 
seems fathomable that in a 
game comparable to a compi-
lation of highlight reels, James 
could actually be outshone. 
But that’s exactly what hap-
pened with all the credit going 
to the West’s backcourt. Curry 
was showing off his ball han-
dling and assisting skills galore 
with phenomenal offensive re-
bounds and assists. One of his 
many recipients was Rockets 
guard James Harden, who put 
on a ?erce display all game 
long, from drilling a step-back 
three pointer against James to 
notching some vicious ?nishes 
at the rim. However, neither 
player could make nearly as 
much of an impact as Oklaho-
ma City Thunder guard Rus-
sell Westbrook. Westbrook has 
always possessed a seemingly 
bottomless reserve of athleti-
cism and energy.
This All-Star game was a 
prime example of what hap-
pens when Westbrook starts 
?nding his inner “Splash 
Brother.” Whenever the West 
asked, he delivered. His per-
formance was nothing short 
of dazzling, from scoring at 
will from behind the arc to 
hitting his head on the back-
board while throwing the ball 
down. It comes as no surprise 
then that he broke the record 
for most points scored in a 
half in an All-Star game, with 
a whopping 27. However, that 
was not enough to make King 
James shy away, and he held 
his own with 22 points in the 
?rst half, leading the East to a 
comeback before the break. At 
halftime, the West were in the 
lead by the skin of their teeth, 
with the scores at 83-82.
The second half provided 
plenty of excitement as things 
started to get more competi-
tive with the time winding 
down. The game’s second 
half featured 12 lead changes 
and nine tie games as the East 
struggled to get back into 
the game with points shared 
across the board for an im-
pressive combined team per-
formance. No player from the 
East scored in double digits in 
the second half. 
The West, on the other 
hand, were strongly led by 
the individual performances 
of Harden, Westbrook, Los 
Angeles Clippers guard Chris 
Paul and Sacramento Kings 
center DeMarcus Cousins, 
all of whom had double digit 
performances in the half. Ex-
MVP Paul ended the night 
with a game-high 15 assists 
— something that seems quite 
normal given his exceptional 
understanding of the game. 
No matter how hard the East 
tried to achieve a lead of more 
than three points, the West 
kept mounting their own of-
fensive plays, which were not 
only more numerous but also 
had a greater rate of success. 
Fate had made up its mind and 
the West were not going to be 
trumped.
If All-Star games had nick-
names, this game would be 
called the “Alley-oop Game of 
2015.” In a game with high-?y-
ing players (both literally and 
metaphorically) why would 
anyone ?nish with a ?oater 
when they could instead lob it 
to a teammate for a rim-rock-
ing dunk that would ignite the 
17,198 people in attendance.
Sky-walkers like James, 
Harden, and Westbrook and 
bigs like San Antonio Spurs 
forward Tim Duncan and At-
lanta Hawks center Al Horford 
were the main source of these 
displays. However, an All Star 
Game is not complete with-
out a memorable moment or 
two and in this case they were 
the dunks by Dallas Mavericks 
forward Dirk Nowitzki and 
Toronto Raptors guard Kyle 
Lowry.
Nowitzki’s display came 
when Curry, the West’s chief 
leader of alley-oop assists 
crossed over the defense and 
executed a perfect lob to a cut-
ting Nowitzki who ?nished 
with both hands before point-
ing to the sky, a reference to 
2000 dunk contest champion 
Vince Carter.
Curry telling Irving at 
the start of the game to “Get 
more cardio in” all of a sudden 
makes sense as the West kept 
up their barrage of brilliance. 
It would not be so easy to for-
get about the East, however, 
as Lowry showed off his hops 
with a fantastic put back slam 
to achieve his ?rst dunk since 
2009.
Having said all that, the 
fabulous performances were 
not limited to ?nishes inside 
the paint. If Lowry was right 
when he said from the bench 
that all anybody wanted from 
the All Star game was to watch 
Kyle Korver shoot threes, then 
the audience de?nitely was  
not left disappointed as Ko-
rver ?nished the game with 
all his points coming from 3’s, 
shooting 7 for 12 from behind 
the arc.
Although Korver was in a 
league of his own, Westbrook 
did not have a poor showing 
either, achieving his whop-
ping 41 points on the game on 
5 of 9 shooting from 3-point 
range. 
Curry and Golden State 
Warriors guard Klay Thomp-
son, known as the Splash 
Brothers, on the other hand, 
exhausted all their 3 pointers 
in the contest earlier in the 
weekend and so had very little 
to contribute to this game.
It seems only appropri-
ate that the man who scored 
the most points — the man 
who soared the highest (as 
evidenced by his head on the 
backboard), the man with all 
the answers for the West — 
should be the man who would 
be awarded the MVP in this 
game of champions. And so 
as Westbrook went home with 
his own silverware, the West 
went home victorious (both 
for the game and the week-
end) yet again.

SPORTS BRIEFS
Track and Field
The Carnegie Mellon 
men’s and women’s track 
and ?eld teams travelled to 
Columbus, Ohio on Saturday 
for the Ohio State Tune Up in 
preparation for the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships next week-
end. While up against many 
large programs, including Di-
vision I (DI) host Ohio State, 
the Tartans performed well 
with the men ?nishing tied 
for 6th out of 21 schools and 
the women ?nishing 12th out 
of 27 competing groups.
Despite being up against 
a lot of top DI competition, 
senior Thomas Vandenberg 
continued his domination of 
the 800 meter run, ?nishing 
?rst with a time of 1:53.48 as 
he sets his sights on defending 
his UAA Championship in the 
event and earning a return in-
vite to the NCAA Champion-
ships. In the 3000 meter run, 
senior George Degen took ad-
vantage of the increased com-
petition to set a career best in 
the event with a 8:22.89 ?n-
ishing time. That time places 
him 9th in the nation and sets 
him up for a possible NCAA 
Championship bid as well.
For the women, senior 
Erin Kiekhaefer ?nished 
fourth in the mile run with 
a time of 5:07.33, setting 
a new career record, while 
sophomore Rebecca Fortner 
cleared the 1.53 meter bar 
in the high jump, which was 
good enough for third. Senior 
Sasha Spalding continued 
her strong season as she set a 
new school record in the long 
jump with a 5.51 meter leap. 
Unfortunately this was only 
good enough for 7th against 
the tough competition, al-
though she was only .18 me-
ters from ?rst and .07 meters 
from third.
Next up for the teams is the 
UAA Championships, hosted 
by University of Chicago. The 
championships will take place 
over two days starting on 
Saturday and ?nishing up on 
Sunday.
Men’s Tennis
Starting on Friday, the 
ninth ranked Carnegie Mellon 
men’s tennis team competed 
in the ITA Indoor Champi-
onship hosted by Gustavus 
Adolphus College.
In their ?rst match in the 
Championship Quarter?nals, 
the Tartans faced off against 
sixth-ranked UAA rival Em-
ory. In the opening doubles 
matches, the Tartans dropped 
two of the three matches with 
only the pair of sophomores, 
Jack Kasbeer and Kenny 
Zheng, pulling out a victory 
with a 8–6 comeback. In the 
singles matches, Carnegie 
Mellon quickly fell behind 
4–1 after losing the ?rst two 
matches, but fought back 
with senior Christian Heaney-
Secord, sophomore Kunal 
Wadwani and Kasbeer pulling 
out victories before the Tar-
tans ultimately lost 5–4 to the 
conference rivals. Wadwani 
won his match in straight 
sets, 6–3, 6–2 while Heaney-
Secord needed three sets 6–2, 
6–7, 6–4 and Kasbeer needed 
a third set tiebreaker for his 
victory, 7–5, 3–6, 10–7.
With the loss, Carnegie 
Mellon moved into the Con-
solation bracket Saturday 
morning, taking on twelfth-
ranked Kenyon College. Again 
the Tartans fell into an early 
hole going 1–2 in the doubles 
matches, this time with senior 
Bryce Beisswanger and junior 
Yuvraj Kumar pulling out the 
sole doubles victory, 8–2.
In singles, Carnegie Mel-
lon struggled mightily, with 
several players losing in 
straight sets. Zheng and Wad-
wani were to only solo victors 
for the Tartans with Wadwani 
again winning in straight sets 
6–1, 7–6 (7–1) and Zheng 
pulling out the tough win 7–6 
(7–2), 6–7 (2–7), 6–4.
Saturday evening, the 
Tartans tried to avoid a com-
plete sweep of the week-
end as they took on four-
teenth ranked host Gustavus 
Adolphus College in the 7th 
place match. In the name of 
consistency, Carnegie Mellon 
quickly fell behind again go-
ing 1–2 after doubles with the 
second pair winning — this 
time it was Beisswanger and 
Kumar with an 8–1 win.
With the threat of a third 
straight defeat, the Tartans 
?nally regained their edge 
in singles play with Heaney-
Secord, Wadwani, and ?rst 
year Tommy Cheng all pulling 
out straight set victories with 
Heaney-Secord and Cheng 
each winning 6–3, 6–4 and 
Wadwani showing them both 
up with his 6–3, 6–3 win. 
Junior Abhishek Alla, who 
struggled all tournament in 
the top seeded singles slot, 
pulled out the come from be-
hind victory to give Carnegie 
Mellon the edge in their ?nal 
match of the weekend, win-
ning 4–6, 6–4, 6–1.
The team will next play 
over spring break when they 
travel to Claremont, Calif. 
for a series of games over the 
week off from school.

CMU basketball splits ?nal home games of the season

On Sunday, Carnegie Mel-
lon ?nished its home basket-
ball season as both the men’s 
and women’s teams faced off 
against Emory University dur-
ing their senior games. While 
the squads split the midday 
double header, both teams 
saw their single season blocks 
records fall as they closed 
out their home schedules in 
front of the Carnegie Mellon 
faithful.
The men started off the 
double header, and had an 
honorary starting lineup with 
all four seniors — guard Jasen 
Blakney, forwards Matt Loe-
bbaka and Kevin Stursberg, 
and captain and guard Seth 
Cordts — and played mean-
ingful minutes throughout 
the game to celebrate the 
years each gave the program.
With sophomore forward 
Jack Serbin rounding out the 
starting line up, the Tartans 
played the Eagles close, with 
Cordts, Serbin, and sopho-
more center Chris Shkil get-
ting all but four of the Tartans’ 
29 points in the ?rst half as a 
pair of Cordts free throws 
combined to put the Tartans 
down only 1 going in to half.
A Serbin jump shot, only 
11 seconds out of half, gave 
Carnegie Mellon their ?rst 
lead while the combo of 
Serbin, Shkil and Cordts con-
tinued their domination, scor-
ing another 21 points for the 
Tartans before the halfway 
mark in the second half, and 
scoring all but 2 points in the 
second half. Unfortunately, 
relying on just three players 
for the hefty majority of the 
scoring left the Tartans vul-
nerable to a cold streak by 
their offensive weapons and 
with 10 minutes to go in the 
half, all three went cold lead-
ing to deep freeze by the Tar-
tans offense and a 15–4 run 
by the Eagles to put the game 
away down the stretch. Al-
though the ?nal tally of 75–63 
Emory may demoralizing for 
the Tartans, the guarantee of 
a winning record for the ?rst 
time in the tenures of any 
of the players plus the new 
single season block record by 
Serbin with 70 and a chance 
to increase his record with a 
game remaining, will act as 
a spring board toward next 
years’ success.
The loss drops the men to 
13–11 on the season and 4–9 
in conference play.
In the second game of the 
double header, the women 
tried to honor their seniors, 
guards MacKenzie Boyd and 
Chandler Cau?eld, with their 
?rst University Athletic Asso-
ciation (UAA) victory in over 
a month in a half.
Starting with a three 
pointer by ?rst-year Anna 
Novak to take an early 3–0 
lead, the Tartans made their 
objectives known and only 
trailed once the entire game, 
which was quickly recti?ed 
by a Boyd three pointer. For 
the game Carnegie Mellon 
lived off of the three, which 
rewarded their trust by allow-
ing a 66.7 shooting percent-
age for the game, driving the 
Tartan offense to an easy vic-
tory, 84–74.
Playing another small 
bench lineup where each start-
er played over 30 minutes, 
each starter was rewarded for 
her commitment by shooting 
at least 50 percent from both 
the ?eld and behind the arc, 
with both junior forward Liza 
Otto and sophomore center 
Lisa Murphy recording dou-
ble-doubles with 10 rebounds 
and 17 points for Otto and a 
game high 29 points and 11 
rebounds for Murphy.
Murphy also set the single 
season blocks record for the 
women’s team with 66 on the 
season before her ?nal game 
of the season on the road.
With the win, the women 
push to 12–12 on the season 
and 3–10 in UAA play with 
a chance to improve both 
records when both Carnegie 
Mellon squads travel to Case 
Western Reserve University 
on Saturday to ?nish out their 
seasons.

In their Friday night double 
header at home, the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s and women’s 
basketball teams played in a 
set of nail bitters that each 
came down to the ?nal min-
ute. The women were on the 
wrong side of the late game 
heroics as they were sunk by 
a last second basket by the 
University of Rochester Yel-
lowjackets, and senior guard 
MacKenzie Boyd’s desperate 
half-court heave was of?ine. 
On the other hand, the men 
were able to maintain their 
lead down the stretch, with 
three-pointers by sophomore 
forward Jack Serbin and ju-
nior guard Jason Sebak to seal 
the deal.
Opening the game, the 
women tried their best to 
break their eight game confer-
ence losing streak, with their 
last University Athletic As-
sociation (UAA) win coming 
against Rochester on Jan. 23. 
With the Tartans determined 
to get a win in their second-
to-last home game of the sea-
son, junior forward Liza Otto 
and sophomore center Lisa 
Murphy fought hard to keep 
the game within reach and 
combined for 20 of Carnegie 
Mellon’s 29 ?rst half points. 
Murphy, Otto, and Boyd, 
along with senior guard Chan-
dler Cau?eld, were pressed 
into heavy minutes with the 
Tartans only playing with two 
reserves. All four played at 
least 33 minutes with Cau?eld 
and Murphy getting less than 
2 minutes each on the bench 
all game with each getting 
one short stint on the bench in 
each half.
After going into the half 
down 2, 31–29, it looked like 
the Tartans were going to fade 
in the second half as they had 
for most of the season. The 
Yellowjackets quickly pushed 
their lead to double digits, just 
over ?ve minutes into the sec-
ond half.
Otto and Murphy respond-
ed by combining to cut the 
de?cit to 5, before Cau?eld hit 
three straight threes to keep 
up with Rochester’s offense 
down the stretch.
Finally, with just under 3 
minutes to go, Murphy was 
fouled as she made a layup, 
and hit the ensuing free throw 
to tie the game up at 56. On 
the next Yellowjackets’ pos-
session, Boyd got the steal and 
passed up to Otto, who was 
fouled and made both of her 
subsequent free throws. This 
gave the Tartans their ?rst 
lead since the ?rst half. Roch-
ester went up 3 with 1:16 re-
maining on a 3–pointer before 
Otto hit another pair of free 
throws to make it a one point 
game. After running down the 
shot clock, the Yellowjackets 
missed a long three and failed 
to convert on the put back 
attempt on the offensive re-
bound. Coming out of a time-
out with under 30 seconds 
left, Otto tried to take the lead 
but missed her jump shot, only 
to have Boyd recover the of-
fensive rebound and kick it out 
to Cau?eld, who faked out the 
defender on the three point 
line and drove to just behind 
the free throw line, where she 
hit the jump shot and gave 
the Tartans the lead with 11 
seconds left. Without taking 
a timeout and giving Carnegie 
Mellon a chance to organize, 
Rochester quickly got the ball 
up court and into the far cor-
ner, where a tough off dribble 
jumper from just inside the 
three point line gave the Yel-
lowjackets the ?nal lead at 
63–62. The Tartans tried to 
heave up a Hail Mary shot, but 
with no time outs, they were 
only able to get up to the half-
court and lob it in the general 
direction of their basket.
The loss knocks the women 
down to 11–12 on the season 
and 2–10 in UAA play.
The men’s game had fewer 
late-game theatrics, although 
that’s probably for the best, 
as the Tartans controlled the 
game from the opening min-
utes with Serbin scoring the 
?rst points of the game. The 
?rst half saw Carnegie Mel-
lon open up an early double 
digit lead — pushing their ad-
vantage all the way to 11 on a 
Sebak three pointer with less 
than 5 minutes to go in the 
half — before the Yellowjack-
ets found their shooting stroke 
and cut the lead down to two 
with just over a minute left in 
the opening half. 
Any momentum Rochester 
could have carried into the 
half was quickly negated, how-
ever, when in the ?nal seconds 
Serbin stole the ball and went 
coast to coast. The half ended 
with a powerful two-handed 
slam to put the Tartans up 4, 
30–26, going into the locker 
room.
Coming out into the second 
half, Carnegie Mellon quickly 
pushed the lead back to the 
comfortable multiple posses-
sion cushion they had before 
the Yellowjacket run. Serbin 
and senior guard Seth Cordts 
ran the offense as they had 
much of the year, with each 
alternating attacking the rim 
and shooting long range jump-
ers and threes.
With just 10:25 left in the 
half, Rochester managed to 
tie the game back up. How-
ever, a lay–up by sophomore 
center Chris Shkil followed by 
his block on the defensive end 
set the stage for the Tartans to 
put the game away once and 
for all, along with a three by 
sophomore guard Matt Hill-
man. Down the stretch, the 
Tartans played tough, aggres-
sive defense while making 
their free throws and getting 
a pair of threes from Sebak to 
make sure the game was never 
in serious doubt again. Carn-
egie Mellon eventually cruised 
to the 64–55 victory.
With the win, the men im-
prove to 13–10 on the season 
and 4–8 in UAA play. The vic-
tory also guaranteed the Tar-
tans their ?rst winning season 
since 2009.  
Both Carnegie Mellon 
squads ?nished up their home 
seasons with a double header 
on Sunday, and will play their 
season ?nales at Case West-
ern, on Saturday.

“College is something you 
want to remember for your 
whole lifetime,” sprinter 
and hurdler Sasha Spalding 
said, retelling the words that 
changed not only her Carnegie 
Mellon experience, but also 
her life, for the better. The 
senior business administra-
tion major and global systems 
and management minor gave 
advice that every student still 
buried nose-deep in home-
work ought to notice.
The Springhill, Fla. na-
tive ?rst became interested in 
sports in ?rst grade, when she 
would wait for the lunch tables 
to be removed from the gym 
before launching into hours of 
basketball. Even though few 
of her friends played and her 
parents weren’t exactly en-
thusiastic about the amount 
of time she spent on the sport, 
she found herself continuing 
to play for the sheer fun of it. 
Although she had intended to 
continue playing basketball 
on her high school’s team, her 
athletic ability was noticed by 
Coach Joel Myers of the track 
team as she played, and Myers 
enlisted the team to convince 
her to give track and ?eld a try.
“It took them a while to 
convince me,” Spalding said. 
While she was passionate 
about basketball, many of 
her friends were on the track 
team, and they eventually 
wore her down. Spalding 
quickly became hooked on 
the sport. Her prowess as a 
basketball player translated 
to both speed and endurance 
on the track. During her high 
school years, the team went to 
the state championships every 
year, and she was an integral 
part of the team’s success.
When the time came to ap-
ply for college, both academ-
ics and athletics were on her 
mind. She was initially inter-
ested in joining a Division I 
school in order to be part of an 
already established program, 
but none of them ?t the aca-
demic rigor she was looking 
for. In Carnegie Mellon, she 
?nally found what she was 
looking for: an academically 
rigorous school with a track 
program that offered her the 
opportunity to play an impor-
tant role.
At ?rst, like many ?rst-year 
students discovering for the 
?rst time what it means to be 
a Tartan, she found herself 
swamped by the workload her 
classes gave her. As a result, 
she was unable to join the 
cross country team because 
she spent all her time on aca-
demics. Needless to say, she 
was not happy with these cir-
cumstances and went to her 
adviser, the Business Admin-
istration Program’s Executive 
Director Dr. Milton Co?eld, 
for the advice that changed 
everything. “School is more 
than academics,” he told her, 
encouraging her to get out 
and do things at which she’d 
be able to look back and smile 
fondly.
Taking his advice to heart, 
Spalding decided that she 
would join the track team for 
the spring semester, despite 
the intense workload. “It was 
awesome,” she said of her 
?rst days with the team. She 
quickly realized that this was 
something she wanted to do 
throughout school. “Everyone 
was really welcoming.” She 
appreciated most how many 
people from different back-
grounds and majors came to-
gether, united by the sport and 
the coaching staff.
Her proudest track ac-
complishment was her per-
formance at a University of 
Chicago meet last year. It was 
a 30 degree day with howl-
ing winds — not the best of 
circumstances. In addition, 
Spalding wasn’t exactly in the 
best shape possible. “I was in-
jured pretty much all season,” 
she said. Despite the ominous 
atmosphere, everything came 
together for her as she ?nished 
second in the long jump and 
third in shot put.
Spalding’s athletic accom-
plishments have only grown 
more impressive since then. 
In the past few weeks, she 
was named University Athletic 
Association (UAA) Women’s 
Field Athlete of the Week, not 
once, but twice. On Feb. 2, 
she earned the honor with her 
performance at Case Western 
Reserve University in the long 
jump, shot put, 200-meter 
dash, and 4X400 relay. Two 
weeks later, she was chosen 
again, this time for her perfor-
mance at Tif?n University on 
Valentines Day. 
During the meet, she set a 
new Carnegie Mellon record 
with a long jump of 5.31 me-
ters.
While she highly values 
her athletic achievements, she 
has given equal value to her

Phantom hauntingly good
Musical brings terrifying character to life in Benedum Center
The Phantom of the Opera, currently being 
performed at the Benedum Center, is a fantastic 
production. It's a part of PNC Broadway Across 
America and certainly lived up to the glitz and talent 
the Broadway label would suggest. The Phantom of 
the Opera first opened in 1986 and still continues 
to be shown on and off-Broadway today. It is the 
longest running musical on Broadway, with over 
10,000 total shows.
The musical is centered around a Phantom who 
is haunting an opera house in late 19th century 
France. He has such deep love for a woman named 
Christine that he begins to control all the shows and 
productions being performed by this opera house 
in order to give Christine an opportunity to sing in 
the spotlight. His love becomes possessive of her 
and frightens all those who visit the opera house. 
The climax of the first act occurs with the famous 
chandelier fall, which is the Phantom’s response 
to Christine not starring in a show. The second 
act features a duel between the Phantom and 
Christine’s long-time friend and fiancé, Raoul. In the 
end, Christine shows the Phantom affection through 
a passionate kiss that takes place in his dungeon 
below the Opera house. It is this kiss and her gift 
of the engagement ring from Raoul that make the 
Phantom realize what a monster he has become and 
inspire him to turn himself in, though he disappears 
when the authorities come to arrest him. Christine 
and Raoul escape to live happily ever after.
The music of The Phantom of the Opera is incredibly 
beautiful and needs very strong, powerful voices 
to give the music the execution it deserves. Chris 
Mann, who plays the Phantom, and Katie Travis, 
playing Christine, had perfect voices for the parts. 
Chris Mann's vocal chops have been widely lauded, 
as he gained his initial claim to fame through NBC’s 
The Voice. He graduated from Vanderbilt University 
with a Vocal Performance degree and has always 
dreamed of being in the role of the Phantom. His 
voice will send shivers up your spine. Katie Travis 
has spent much of her life on the stage. She recently 
played Cosette in a national tour of Les Misérables. 
Like Chris, she has always wanted to be Christine 
in The Phantom of the Opera. Her voice has such 
purity and grace that it was impossible not to fall in 
love with the music she sings.
The Phantom of the Opera has several scenes where 
impressive special effects are needed in order to 
communicate the terrifying extent of the Phantom's 
anger and emotional angst. In past productions, 
the Benedum has not been known for its special 
effects. However this show really demonstrated the 
Benedum's crew and production designers' ability 
to implement an awe-inspiring special effect-filled 
production. For instance, the chandelier drop was 
completely believable, as was the fire the caused by 
the Phantom throughout the musical. It was done 
on stage in a beautiful and captivating way. The 
Benedum also had speakers spread throughout the 
audience to make sure that the Phantom’s powerful 
voice surrounded everyone in the crowd.
The Phantom of the Opera was a very enjoyable and 
striking production in downtown Pittsburgh. The 
classic story, beautiful music, and lifelike special 
effects made for a wonderful show. The musical will 
be at The Benedum Center until March 1.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Evan,
I love Idris Elba more than 
any other actor ever. He’s 
just been getting more 
and more attention for his 
work recently, and Luther 
has got to be one of the 
best, most intense series 
of all time. 
There’s been a lot of hype 
for a while now about 
who the next James 
Bond is going to be, and 
Idris is number one on 
a lot of people’s lists to 
take over that timeless 
role — myself included, 
of course. He’s just too 
perfect for it: buff, tall, 
menacing, but also suave, 
gorgeous, and English. 
Plus, it would be so great 
to have a black James 
Bond. And Pierce Brosnan 
thinks Idris would be a 
great Bond!
What do you think the 
chances are of Idris 
getting the slot?
Expectantly,
Can’t Let Anyone Steal his 
Show, Yelling For Action, 
Need to Get Idris Running 
Lengths (of trains)
Dear CLASSY FANGIRL,
You’re not the only one: 
Since at least 2011, nearly 
everyone who cares about 
the Bond franchise wants 
Idrissa Akuna “Idris” Elba 
— best known as the star 
corrupt cop on Luther, the 
savvy drug kingpin on The 
Wire, and Nelson Mandela in 
that biopic no one saw — to 
be the next beloved 007. 
Heck, even Sony wants him, 
if Sony co-chairman Amy 
Pascal’s leaked emails from 
the notorious hack are any 
indication (which, I mean, 
how much more clear can 
you be?) 
Naysayers do exist, however. 
Idris is black, and Rush 
Limbaugh doesn’t seem 
to like that, but he doesn’t 
appear to like anything 
that might dent the white 
patriarchy — well, really, he 
doesn’t seem to like much 
of anything or anyone with 
post-Civil War ideologies. 
Esquire gave Idris a snub, 
too, when their list of 
possible new Bond actors 
saw him conspicuously 
excluded.)
Well, Esquire, you can take 
back your Christian Bale 
and Jon Hamm (not even 
remotely European, Esquire! 
Get it together). All we want 
is Idris.
That said, TJ Ramini would 
make a great Bond as well, 
but no one knows who he 
is — he had a brief role 
as “Crane Thug No. 1” in 
Batman Begins, so I guess 
that’s a start.
You have good taste,
Evan Kahn

It isn’t common to see both philharmonic and choir 
billed on the same program, but visitors to Oakland’s 
Carnegie Music Hall had the rare treat of enjoying vocal 
and instrumental student talent on Thursday night. 
The addition of Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra (PSO) 
music director Manfred Honeck as guest conductor 
— ultimately the biggest selling point for the event — 
sealed the deal on a crowd-drawing and star-studded 
evening.
Thanks to dogged advertising by the School of Music, 
the combination of choir and orchestra, and Honeck’s 
loyal Pittsburgh fan base, the hall was ?lled up to the 
second balcony, with available seating on the orchestra 
level scarce if existent at all. Community members older 
than Carnegie Mellon af?liates poured through the doors 
at the concert’s beginning, populating the seats with 
greying perms and combovers.
The evening began with a surprise announcement: 
The two pieces on the program were to be switched, 
Dvorák’s New World Symphony performed ?rst rather 
than Mozart’s Requiem — a wise choice on the part of 
the program organizers. Though both works are well 
known and promised excellent execution by student 
performers, it isn’t unreasonable to think that if the 
Mozart was performed ?rst, the audience might have 
thinned after intermission.
President Suresh took the stage next to introduce 
Honeck and expressed his appreciation of continued 
collaboration between Carnegie Mellon and the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra, citing the 25 PSO 
musicians currently mentoring Carnegie Mellon 
students. “We very much appreciate the partnership,” 
Suresh said.
Without a word, Honeck launched the Dvorák with 
a performance that immediately distinguished 
itself with crisp phrasing in the violins and uni?ed, 
moving dynamics. Honeck took the famous second 
movement at a faster tempo than usual — unsettling, 
at ?rst, but ultimately refreshing: No one could even 
remotely accuse the rendition of dragging. Meanwhile, 
master’s student in music performance Ian Woodworth 
established himself as star soloist of the night with 
enchanting renderings of classic passages on English 
horn.
Honeck proved himself an emotive and engaged leader 
of the orchestra, unafraid to crouch to the musicians’ 
level rather than conducting from above and afar. 
During the gentle prairie-reminiscent theme of the third 
movement, he fell into a kind of jovial, folksy, swaying 
dance, ?icking his baton as if the musicians were 
wagonners rather than string and brass players.
While it generally met our expectations of excellence 
from the School of Music, the performance wasn’t 
perfect: There were more than a couple missteps, the 
most prominent from solo talent in the horn section. 
And the third movement came to a shaky, uncertain 
conclusion as an overzealous violinist played a wrong 
line.
Despite the rocky end to the third movement, the 
orchestra compensated in the fourth, shaking off the 
transition and entering blaring, stomping, and strong, 
with well-controlled crescendos building toward a 
con?dent ?nish. The piece ended thunderously in an 
explosion of timpani and brass.
While the Dvorák featured minimal adaptation or 
embellishment, the Mozart infused a number of new 
elements. Between sections, CBS sportscaster Verne 
Lundquist read an excerpt of a letter from Mozart 
to his father (a welcome and chilling addition that 
richened the performance) and passages from the Book 
of Revelation (interesting but a bit overdone). The 
Requiem also brought professional vocal talent to the 
stage: soprano Lianne Coble, mezzo-soprano Amanda 
Crider, bass Tom McNichols, and tenor Kyle Stegall — 
by far the best and most musically self-aware of the four.
The overabundance of professional talent brings 
into question why more students weren’t given the 
spotlight: Any vocal performance major would surely 
have jumped at the opportunity for a solo, and even 
the narrator’s role could have been ?lled by any of the 
gifted orators in the School of Drama. Here, the School 
of Music appeared to serve its own image more than 
the educational needs of its students. The professional 
element certainly seized more public attention for 
the concert, but seemed to deprive students of 
opportunities to learn and shine.
The student vocalists, however, didn’t waste their 
limelight. Despite occasional imbalance with the 
orchestra and a little over enunciation (the sharp 
repetition of “et lux perpetua” pierced the soundscape 
with every pointed consonant), the choir excelled with 
controlled dynamics and rehearsed technique. The 
end of the “Requiem aeternam” dropped to a beautiful 
pianissimo, while the “Dies irae” made a thundering, 
unhesitating entrance on the heels of a reading from the 
Book of Revelation. In “Confutatis,” the women’s voices 
hovered lovely and angelic above the din, while the men 
gained vigor over time.
The most famous and best performed section, 
“Lacrimosa,” was perhaps a little fast and stunted in 
its phrasing, but stylistic differences aside, it sounded 
impeccable.
After a high-energy, tumbling “Offertorium,” Honeck 
concluded by signaling a series of solemn, solitary, 
barely audible chimes, offering only a gentle open and 
close of his ?ngers as a gesture to the percussionist, 
reveling in the drama in silence. This silence didn’t 
last long, though, as Honeck lowered his arm and the 
audience erupted in standing cheers.

The future of The Daily Show without Jon Stewart 
TV network tasked with replacing the irreplaceable in light of Stewart’s recent announcement
A TV program that has spawned three separate 
spin-off fake news TV programs is now desperately 
trying to save itself after Jon Stewart announced 
that he would be leaving his gig hosting of the 
program. His reasons for leaving the show after 16 
years of manning the desk are related to his need 
for flexibility with his schedule. He has said that he 
needs to make more time for his family and that he 
wants to focus his efforts on his children for the next 
few years. He has explicitly said he is not retiring; 
he has been a producer for the show for a long time 
and he is likely staying on in that role. He is not the 
first host of the program and will not be the last, and 
Comedy Central is actively seeking a new host for 
the program. The network had to deal with a similar 
situation in the recent past after The Colbert Report 
ended when Stephen Colbert (an alum of The Daily 
Show) left to host the Late Show on CBS.
Many different contributors to The Daily Show have 
gone on to host their own shows that focused on the 
same, or similar, topics, such as Stephen Colbert, 
John Oliver (with HBO’s Last Week Tonight,) and now 
Larry Wilmore (with the new The Nightly Show with 
Larry Wilmore on Comedy Central). It is ironic that 
the show is looking to find a new host after losing 
two potential hosts (Oliver and Wimore) less than a 
year ago. Still, various outlets have been speculating 
on who might replace Jon Stewart. These possible 
replacements include many high-profile names in 
media as well as current contributors to the show 
and writers for other programs. 
Most outlets have focused on Jessica Williams as a 
possibility for hosting the show, but through a series 
of Tweets (@msjwilly), Williams denied that she 
would be hosting and said that at this point in time 
she was under-qualified for the job. Although some 
people are disappointed that she would not host the 
show, it is true that she is very young and could go 
for it later in her life. If The Daily Show were to hire 
her as host, she would be the youngest host of any 
late night television show, and she would be the only 
woman in the late night arena.
If Jon had left the show, Seth Meyers might have 
been the person I would have seen manning the 
desk; however, since he is the new host of Late Night 
at NBC it is safe to assume he will not be asked to 
host The Daily Show. Meyers is just getting used to 
hosting Late Night and will continue to adjust, just 
as Fallon did before him. I would have also been 
looking at past Weekend Update anchors since 
they have experience with the style of comedy and 
could bring in a new style for the show, but Jimmy 
Fallon is hosting The Tonight Show, Amy Poehler 
is finishing Parks & Recreation, and Tina Fey is 
busy with Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt, the new 
Netflix comedy she’s developing. The nature and 
complexity of The Daily Show calls for writers that 
are experienced with writing political comedy on a 
daily basis, a difficult task not everyone can handle. 
The team of writers for the show is not changing, so 
it should remain consistent with the new host, but 
the host does contribute to the format of the program 
and has the tough task of delivery.
With all the names being presented as possible 
hosts for the show, I think the possibility of having 
co-anchors or an interim host in order to assist with 
the transition process is very likely. One possibility 
is Brian Williams now that he has been suspended 
for six months from NBC. The idea of having an 
experienced and respected anchor of one of the 
highest rated news programs in the nation go to 
Comedy Central to host a satirical news program 
is unconventional and is not something that most 
people would think of. However, Brian Williams has 
been a guest on the show many times, is the only 
news anchor to ever host Saturday Night Live, has 
slow-jammed the news with Jimmy Fallon, and has 
been a guest for countless other TV sitcoms; he has 
all the qualities one would need for hosting the show 
and would be able to give Comedy Central the time it 
needs to find a more permanent host for the program.
The fact that a lot of the show’s staff could pull 
off the hosting gig is good and bad, because the 
main problem with them is that they don’t have the 
experience or the gravitas necessary to deliver the 
fake news properly. Still, having them co-anchor 
with Williams or split the time with him could give 
Comedy Central a better idea of who is the right 
person for the job since the network cannot simply 
let them develop into it over time. Having to replace 
two main programs in so little time has put the 
network on a very thin tightrope because they need 
to find a balance between giving a new person a 
chance, and keeping their ratings high in order to 
keep the shows alive. 
A similar thing happened at NBC twice in the last 
decade; both times they pushed their Late Night 
host into The Tonight Show and found a replacement 
for Late Night because the host promoted had 
already proven himself and they were not worried 
they would lose ratings. However, during that time 
the new Late Night host could experiment and find 
his way of hosting the program. Comedy Central’s 
predicament is that their Late Night counterpart 
(The Colbert Report) just got replaced and is in the 
process of transitioning to the Nightly Show with 
Larry Wilmore, so they cannot afford to also lose The 
Daily Show audience and the show's rating as one 
of the highest rated programs for the timeslot. This 
leaves Comedy Central with big shoes to fill and no 
clear-cut option for replacing Jon Stewart.

Before I left to study abroad in Paris for a semester, 
whenever I would tell someone about my plans, I 
would often receive a very similar reaction from 
everyone: “Don’t you know that the French hate 
Americans”?
This is perhaps the stereotype that frightened me 
the most before I arrived, as well as the one that, for 
me at least, has been disproved during my time here. 
The French do not hate Americans. What they hate is 
when you are rude, expect others to instantly speak 
English, and not lack self-control. Unfortunately, those 
are three things that Americans seem apt to do when 
they are in Paris. But avoiding French anger is easy — 
all you have to do are three things:
Greet each cashier, security guard, waiter, bartender, 
etc. with a smile and a “bonjour!” or “bonsoir!” and 
leave with a “Merci, au revoir!” Politeness is vital to 
how you are treated, and in general makes the world a 
better place.
Try to speak French. Use whatever French you have, 
even if that is just the ability to say that you do not 
speak French. Most people you encounter can, in fact, 
speak English, and are more than willing to if you ask, 
but they do not want to be forced to use it. Imagine 
if someone came into your workplace and instantly 
expected you to speak their language. I’m going to bet 
you would not be happy. So instead, make an effort, 
try something new, and show some respect to the 
country that you are visiting.
Control yourself. The French hate public intoxication, 
to the point where even a taxi will not take you 
home if you are very visibly inebriated. The French 
drink to enjoy themselves, not to get drunk. Perhaps 
Americans would be better off if they did the same.
These three rules have helped me through every 
situation I have been in since arriving in Paris, and 
surprisingly I have yet to encounter any genuinely 
rude French people. While other American students 
complained about how they could not get service 
at the bar (probably because they refused to speak 
French and yelled for the bartender), I sipped my 
drink that the waitress had happily suggested. When 
I accidentally swiped my Metro card twice and had to 
wait for eight minutes, a helpful older French woman 
showed me how to sneak in when she swiped her 
own card. And while I have had to deal with a de?nite 
language barrier, the only things necessary are a 
simple “bonjour” and some patience.
Though I have not been in this beautiful country and 
around Parisians for very long, I have learned that 
kindness is a universal language that can open any 
door, as long as you are willing to put yourself out 
there and try.

Have you ever been mindlessly scrolling through pages 
and pages of food on Pinterest when one dish jumps 
out at you? You pin it on your "omg yummy" board and 
de?nitely plan to make it for that one party coming up 
in a few weeks. But a few weeks isn't soon enough. You 
need it. You literally need it right now. You can't stop 
thinking about it because it is the stuff of dreams, the 
nectar of the gods, the greatest good of all.
Maybe that's never happened to you, but it's a feeling 
I know all too well, and it happened when I found these 
gooey cookie dough butter bars. Yes. Gooey butter. And 
cookie dough. Baked together into a tasty dream bar, 
and with a generous dusting of powdered sugar on top. 
It's got all the buzzwords.
So maybe you just had your ?rst midterm and it didn't 
really go well. You'd like to eat to forget. You should 
make these.
Or maybe you went to the EOC last week and scored 
an insane internship. You deserve a celebration. I 
recommend making these.
It's too cold. You need to start putting on more weight to 
stay warm. I am con?dent these will do the trick.
Or maybe you're just hungry and have great taste. Make 
them. No matter who you are, make them or I will ?nd 
you and I will make them for you.
Cookie Dough Gooey Butter Bars
Base
1 box of yellow cake mix
½ cup of butter, melted
1 egg
Cookie Dough Layer
½ cup of butter, room temperature
1 cup of light brown sugar
2 tablespoons of milk
1 teaspoon of vanilla
½ teaspoon of salt
1 cup of ?our
1 cup of chocolate chips
Gooey Butter Layer
8 ounces of cream cheese, room temperature
1 cup of light brown sugar
1 teaspoon of vanilla
2 eggs
1½ cups of powdered sugar
I know there are a lot of ingredients, and there are going 
to be a lot of steps, but I promise it's easier than you 
think. So bear with me; it's completely worth it. 
Before you get started, line a 9-in.-by-13-in. baking pan 
with aluminum foil and spray it with nonstick spray. If 
you use a glass pan, heat the oven to 325, or 350 degrees 
Fahrenheit if you use a metal pan. Now comes the fun 
part. First, just mix together the melted butter, egg, and 
cake mix. If you happen to forget to melt the butter and 
wonder  "what on earth is this sandy mess," which I 
de?nitely didn't do both times that I've made these, you 
can always throw the mixing bowl in the microwave to 
soften it all up. This stuff is super tasty, so do yourself a 
favor and lick the beaters. Using your hands and treating 
this mixture kind of like Play-Doh, press it down into an 
even layer on the bottom of the pan.
Next, for the cookie dough layer, mix the butter and 
brown sugar together. When they're all yummy and 
?uffy, add the milk and vanilla. Mix in the ?our and salt, 
and ?nally stir in the chocolate chips. Play with Play-Doh 
again and press this layer on top of the base, but leave 
about a half inch on all sides. Also, de?nitely save a little 
spoonful for yourself.
And it's ?nally time for the gooey butter layer. Mix up 
the softened cream cheese and brown sugar. Add in the 
eggs and vanilla. Then mix in the powdered sugar. Pour 
that over the top of the cookie dough layer and bake it for 
30 minutes.
When you pull it out of the oven, let it cool for about a 
half hour. In order for it to set the whole way, put it in 
the fridge for at least two hours. But if you choose not 
to wait, it won't be as pretty but it will still taste great. I 
wouldn't blame you.
To ?nish it all off, you've got to do sprinkle powdered 
sugar on the top. It only takes a little bit of effort, but it 
goes a long way toward making it prettier and tastier.
Finally, get a glass of milk, sit down with some friends (or 
Net?ix) and try not to get drool on your shirt.

Above and Beyond, the famous Trance trio composed 
of Jono Grant, Tony McGuinness, and Paavo Siljamäki, 
have always made music in a bubble of their own. From 
the genre’s humble subcultural beginnings in the early 
2000s to the massive raves of today, Above and Beyond 
has always been somewhat left of center. They’ve 
written and recorded on their own terms, unaffected by 
the larger industry trends.
In a sense, Above and Beyond has come to symbolize 
the anti-EDM group. Intricate, lush melodies blend 
perfectly into one another. Vocals and lyrics aren’t 
tacked on at the end, rather they are the focal point of 
the entire creative process. Instead of massive buildups 
to stadium sized drops, their music has traditionally 
relied on subtler, smoother techniques to get people’s 
hands in the air. Paavo and Jono have often spoken 
about how they compose in a classical-acoustic setting 
before giving their songs an electronic backdrop, and 
this approach has served them well. Their 2006 debut 
album, Tri-State, is arguably the greatest Trance record 
of all time. Their second album, 2010’s Group Therapy, 
went on to to receive rave reviews as well.
Their newly released third album, We Are All We Need, 
follows a similar template to equally great, if somewhat 
predictable conclusions. Featuring the group’s signature 
blend of highly layered synth lines, silky smooth 
reverb-heavy vocals, classical touches and razor sharp 
production, it’s dif?cult to ?nd fault with the album. 
Guest vocalists and producers abound: Singing duties 
are divided between Alex Vargas, Zoë Johnston, and 
Richard Bedford. As for production, the supremely 
talented Andrew Bayer lends his own unique touch to 
several of the songs. As a whole, each guest spot ends 
up carrying a slightly different ?avor, while cohesively 
?tting in with the group’s overall sound.
The album opens on a high note, with the simple piano 
and strings driven “Quieter is Louder.” Carried by a 
beautifully minimalist riff, the song lives up to its name 
and sets a precedent for a record that is built around the 
idea that “less is more.” Next up is the title track, and 
the ?rst to be fronted by Zoë Johnston, “We Are All We 
Need.” She sings of love, ?nding solace from sorrow, and 
running away with her lover. As such, the song begins 
the narrative of a relationship that will go on to ?nd its 
way into almost every song henceforth, from its birth to 
its highs and lows to its ultimate demise.
And so the music continues for the next fourteen 
tracks: gleaming and smooth on the surface, and yet not 
without substance underneath. One of the lowest points 
of the album is it’s most commercial track, “Blue Sky 
Action”, sung by Alex Vargas. Although there is nothing 
inherently wrong with the song, it feels bland and 
hastily put together when compared to the intricacy that 
permeates the rest of the record. That being said, this 
one song shouldn’t be a commentary on Alex Vargas, 
who does a spectacular job for the majority of the record. 
Of all his tracks, one that deserves special mention is 
“All Over The World.” His voice carries a delicacy, an 
indescribable vulnerability, that single handedly carries 
the song’s theme of a son losing his father.
The real standout song however, is “Fly To New 
York.” Sung by Zoë Johnston, this is one of the lesser 
promoted tracks that hasn’t received much attention 
online or on radio. A cozy and warm song, this isn’t 
going to be setting any dance ?oors on ?re. That said, 
the song perfectly captures so many of the things that 
make Above & Beyond as good as they are. From Zoë’s 
spectacular, soaring vocals to the soft, pulsating beat, 
“Fly To New York” is the perfect song to pick you up and 
put a smile on your face and a spring in your step.
As a whole, We Are All We Need is far more hopeful 
than any previous Above & Beyond record, or really 
any previous Trance record. Euphoric and uplifting, 
the album is a celebration of a great group that is at its 
peak in a genre that has taken the musical world by 
storm over the past few years. Above & Beyond play 
to their strengths in the album, allowing the guests on 
the record to bring in the requisite diversity to their 
sound. All in all, while We Are All We Need is nothing 
new, its sheer quality puts it above reproach and makes 
for a thoroughly enjoyable, if somewhat unsurprising, 
listening experience.

I'm studying abroad in Spain this semester, so I'm trying to 
take it easy with my relentless TV obsession. I tell you this 
because Agent Carter is one of the two shows from back 
home that I'm still following, and I'm sticking with it because 
it's that good.
“SNAFU,” the penultimate episode of Agent Carter's 
eight-episode ?rst season, aired on Tuesday this week. 
The episode deals with the consequences of Agent Peggy 
Carter's (Hayley Atwell) arrest by her colleagues at the 
Strategic Scienti?c Reserve (SSR) for aiding and abetting 
the wanted criminal Howard Stark. Carter realizes that Dr. 
Ivchenko, a supposed witness, is actually working for the 
villains, and convinces her co-workers to let her help them. 
The show builds up a slow, pervasive sense of dread, and 
then delivers on that buildup with Captain Dooley's choice to 
sacri?ce his own life to save everyone else in the SSR of?ce 
from a bomb. A few examples of the pure-gold dialogue in 
this episode:
Carter to her SSR coworkers, on how she could possibly be 
handling such delicate situations on her own: “I conducted 
my own investigation because no one listens to me. I got 
away with it because no one looks at me. Because unless I 
have your reports, your coffee, or your lunch, I am invisible.” 
This was a succinct, on-the-nose example of how Agent 
Carter calls out the sexism of its era — in an awesome mic-
drop moment, too.
Peggy on hiding Steve's blood: “I suppose I wanted a second 
chance at keeping him safe.” Just a note here: I am far, far 
more emotionally invested in Carter's loss of Steve and her 
grief for him than I ever was in their actual relationship. In 
the Captain America movie, there was hardly any depth or 
emotional nuance in their relationship. But Agent Carter the 
television show plays it much more subtly, which makes it 
much more emotionally powerful. Though the show can be a 
tri?e heavy-handed with the “everyone misses Steve” trope, 
when the writers keep it delicate, like they do with this line, 
it's gorgeously awful: “We're still attached to a table.”
I loved this episode. Hell, I love this show. It's got so many 
things that are right up my alley, stylistically speaking: a cool-
headed, kick-ass heroine, a late ‘40s visual aesthetic, campy 
science ?ction, and melodramatic villains. Atwell sells Carter 
as a smart, tough lady who refuses to take anything lying 
down, and James D'Arcy is hilarious as Mr. Jarvis, who is 
impeccably gracious and bitingly sardonic by turns. Bridget 
Regan as Dottie Underwood has both the take-no-prisoners 
attitude and the “who, me?” innocent eyes down cold. 
The show is fast, charming fun that never lags and I think 
that the 8-episode cap on the ?rst season is a large reason 
for that precision in storytelling. It adroitly tackles the casual 
sexism of the era and calls it out, without ever making that 
the forefront of an episode.
My one major critique of the show is the overwhelmingly 
white cast. Agent Carter exhibits a major ?aw of many 
historical (well, semi-historical, in this case) television 
programs, in that the show seems to forget that people of 
color existed back then, too. The show portrays the struggles 
faced by white women extremely well, and some of those 
issues — losing the hard-won autonomy and respect of the 
war years, for example — were absolutely felt by men and 
women of color just as much as white women. Agent Carter 
is uniquely poised to portray and discuss those experiences, 
and its writers should take that opportunity — all the more 
reason to hope for a second season!

These are the times in life when it’s all right to hate the Harry Potter franchise. If it 
hadn’t been for the successful division of the last installment, then there wouldn’t 
be these other Hollywood franchises following suit and failing. First there was the 
Twilight franchise, now the Hunger Games, and the Divergent series has yet to 
come. So I'm going to be honest: it was completely unnecessary in Twilight, and 
the same goes for The Hunger Games’s third installment, The Hunger Games: 
Mockingjay Part 1. This movie just serves as a prolonged lead up to the ?nal 
installment. It follows Katniss Everdeen (my queen, Jennifer Lawrence) as she 
prepares to rebel against the Capitol. Because it is only half of the third book, it 
lacks plot and their signature action sequences. So if you just want to stare at 
beautiful people that don’t really do much for a couple hours, then this movie is for 
you. But just be warned, this is an “adventure” movie with very little adventure.

This week, Carnegie Mellon’s Purnell School Of Drama 
continues performances of a The Wizard Of Oz adaptation 
known as The Wiz. Based on a book by William F. Brown, 
directed and choreographed by Tomé Cousin, with music 
and lyrics written by Charlie Smalls, the production is a high 
octane musical full of vibrant sets, rambunctious musical 
numbers and elaborately choreographed dances. Loud 
and brash on the surface, but with signi?cant meaning 
underneath, this adaptation of a classic put forth by Carnegie 
Mellon’s School Of Drama makes for a rollicking good time 
and also leads to some pensive re?ection.
The core story of Oz is one of the greatest ever told — a 
simple Kansas girl goes on a magical adventure through 
the land of Oz. With a kind heart, she makes friends and 
wins over the people of Oz, banishing evil in the process. 
Most importantly, she comes to learn that whatever she 
seeks cannot be given to her by an outsider, because it is 
already within her. It is nothing short of incredible that this 
idea carries so much weight, and resonates so universally 
more than a hundred years after The Wizard Of Oz was ?rst 
written.
The big difference with The Wiz is the way that story 
is delivered to the audience. Saucy, colorful, and full of 
unbridled energy, the Wiz is a red-hot, white-knuckled 
journey through Oz that leaves the audience in wonder or in 
splits multiple times every minute.
The musical numbers are heavily in?uenced by R&B, funk 
and the Blues. With shuf?ing, tappable rhythms and big 
sing-along choruses, the music is designed to stay in your 
head long after the show is over. Some of the songs, such 
as “Brand New Day,” which comes after the defeat of the 
Wicked Witch Of The West, are huge and elaborate, with 
nearly the entire cast on stage singing and dancing at 
the same time. Others, such as “So You Wanted To Meet 
The Wizard,” are carried singlehandedly by the namesake 
character. The standout song, however, is “Be A Lion.” 
Sung by Dorothy and The Lion, the song is by far the most 
touching of the lot. This song is the ?rst time Dorothy really 
blooms as a character; furthermore, one can really feel for The 
Lion’s plight.
The casting is spot on as well. Every character is more 
than suf?cient, and a few stand out as truly brilliant. Senior 
musical theatre major Alexis Floyd makes for an incredible 
Dorothy. Playing an innocent rural girl with a heart of gold, 
Floyd successfully takes this sparse set of traits and builds 
a character that the audience comes to love. Senior musical 
theatre major Jean G. Floradin as The Lion is another great 
choice. Floradin is captivating in every scene he dominates, 
and ends up dominating most scenes he is in. It is The Wiz 
himself, however, played by senior musical theatre major 
Erron Crawford, that is the play’s proverbial ace in the hole. 
From his Act One scenes as his all powerful avatar to his 
Second Act unravelling, Erron is incredibly versatile, going 
from threatening to sermonizing, from being a hapless victim 
to a sleazy liar, through the course of the play.
All in all, The Wiz is what you’d expect when one of the 
?nest drama schools in the country does an adaptation of one 
of the greatest stories of the modern era — mostly excellent, 
with tiny ?aws here and there. Parts of Act One, such as 
those with Addaperle, The Good Witch Of The North, 
sometimes feel overdone. Act Two seems a little rushed. 
The Wicked Witch Of The West is vanquished within ten 
minutes of the show’s reconvening. That said, the show’s 
strengths handily outweigh its weaknesses and cumulatively 
make for a pleasant and enjoyable two hours.

School of Drama’s The Wiz ?lled with unbridled energy
Winter musical brings audience on a journey with Dorothy in a reimagined land of Oz
The Maids is a one-act play with all the highbrow intellectual-
ism, interpretative dancing, and incestuous undertones an 
unsuspecting theater-goer could ask for.
The first word that came to my mind upon entering the 
theater was “intimate.” The moderately-sized performance 
space, laid out like a lavish bedroom, was lit in soft purple 
and overhung with metallic arches. The most striking thing 
about the set was the tinfoil partially covering the arches and 
much of the bedroom furniture. The thin layer of silvery tinfoil 
over rusting metal and dull wood suggested to me a façade of 
glamorousness, peeling to reveal the corruption beneath.
The Maids is, after all, centered around the idea of false, 
assumed identity. Though I went into this production familiar 
with Jean Genet’s 1947 play about sister maids plotting to 
murder their employer, I can imagine the confusion of unac-
quainted audience members. The relationship between the 
sisters, Solange, played by junior acting major Cara Ronzetti, 
and Claire, played by senior acting major Cathryn Dylan, is 
difficult to pin down. It shifts rapidly from sisterly to mater-
nal to sexual, keeping the audience constantly in a state of 
unease.
The performative nature of Solange and Claire’s relationship 
becomes most evident in their “Ceremony.” In this role-
playing game, each in turn assumes the role of the dominant 
“Madame” and the submissive “Claire,” the former prancing 
around in their mistress’s best gown and abusing the other 
in a way that can only be described as sadomasochistic. The 
culmination of the game — the final, quite literally sexual 
release at play’s end — shifts their power dynamics once 
more as “Claire” rises up and acts upon her homicidal urges 
toward “Madame.”
Both lead actresses shone in their dynamic roles, and junior 
acting major Caroline Pluta was a breath of fresh air as the 
self-absorbed but well-intentioned Madame. Solange showed 
off her fantastic range during Solange’s final monologue. 
For the five-minute-long speech, during which a mentally-
unhinged Solange addresses a variety of characters in a vari-
ety of roles, Solange was the car crash the audience simply 
could not look away from.
As suggested by the role playing at the core of its plot, The 
Maids tackles a host of complicated issues including identity, 
sexuality, gender, and class, and how they are all essentially 
“performed” in society. Essentially, this play is so ripe for 
analysis that it’s a Sparknotes dream come true.
The audience is introduced to the play’s multitude of 
themes when the two main actresses dawdle onstage in 
their underthings, before donning their respective costumes 
and launching into performance. Prior to the first line being 
spoken, they perform a bizarre, blank-faced interpretative 
dance to the oppressive beat of The Velvet Underground. The 
meaning behind this interesting stylistic choice was unclear 
until the same dance sequence was performed upon the 
first entrance of Madame about midway through the play. It 
clicked all at once that the dance was a necessary step for 
each character — and actress — to assume their “roles.”
The Velvet Underground music that played throughout (most 
notably “I’ll Be Your Mirror”) was one facet of the production’s 
intriguing blend of time periods. The juxtaposition of decades 
was also suggested by the program, which featured fictional-
ized correspondence between Andy Warhol and Genet dated 
1969. While Madame’s smart blue suit and coiffed up-do is 
true to the play’s year of setting and to her stature, the maids 
sport ’60s bobs and bangs that only serve to highlight the 
separation between them and Madame.
The Maids is an ambitious play that is perhaps literary to 
a fault, but nevertheless this production of it was undoubt-
edly skillful. You may leave the theater uncomfortable and a 
little bit confused by the substance of this play, but you will 
leave without a doubt entranced in the artistry of those who 
brought it to life.

Horoscopes
aries
march 21–april 19
Aries have a lot of energy and have trouble sleeping. Their 
dreams are often intense and vivid so it’s difficult to wind 
down at night. Sleeping on your side may improve your 
night’s rest.
taurus
april 20–may 20
Sleep can be very fitful for Taurus if they are not 
comfortable. They are especially sensitive to their 
environment and sleep best in company.
gemini
may 21–june 21
Gemini can survive on fairly minimal amounts of sleep, but it 
eventually catches up with them. Their minds are always on 
overdrive, so sleep doesn’t come easily. Sleep may seem 
like an inconvenience.
cancer
june 22–july 22
Cancer have restless sleep patterns because they are 
likely to suffer nightmares. Bedtime is especially volatile 
for Cancer because they dwell on their troubles before 
sleeping.
leo
july 23–aug. 22 
Most Leo are back sleepers, and tend to fall asleep quite 
easily if they aren’t stressed. They appreciate bed time and 
like to sleep amongst the most luxurious and sensuous of 
sheets and linen.
virgo
aug. 23–sept. 22
Virgo cannot sleep if they are stressed or in an environment 
of disorder. They have a chronic habit of overthinking, which 
makes it difficult to relax. They function best when they 
have obtained a sleeping schedule.
libra
sept. 23–oct. 22
Libra alternate between sleeping too much and not enough. 
They can survive on minimal sleep for a short period, then 
literally spend days in bed.
scorpio
oct. 23–nov. 21
Scorpio’s sleep is directed by their state of moods. A lifted 
Scorpio will survive on minimal sleep, pushing bed time 
back as late as possible as they fall into their concentrated 
obsessions. An unhappy Scorpio needs a lot a sleep.
sagittarius
nov. 22–dec. 21
Sagittarius can survive on a minimal sleep arrangement, but 
tend to naturally exhaust themselves throughput the day. 
However, less sleep means more restless dreams.
capricorn
dec. 22–jan. 19
Capricorn appreciate their sleep and try to get as much as 
possible. A stressed Capricorn will have pronounced sleep 
troubles — insomnia is an indicator of great inner distress 
for this sign.
aquarius
jan. 20–feb. 18
Aquarius have pronounced sleep troubles and tend to be 
restless and uncomfortable. Their racing thoughts tend to 
make it difficult for them to fall asleep at night.
pisces
feb. 19–march 20
Sleep is essential for Pisces. Out of all the zodiac, they 
need the most hours. Their receptive nature means they are 
drained by others, and sleep restores their energy reserves.
