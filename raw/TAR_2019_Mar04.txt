Power outages due to wind resolved quickly
JAMES HAGERTY
Junior Staffwriter
On Monday, Feb. 25, winds 
reaching as high as 60 mph 
caused a power outage that af-
fected multiple facilities on 
and off campus. Speci?cally, 
Morewood E-Tower, Morewood 
Gardens, and Stever House lost 
power for several hours. The af-
fected housing facilities, almost 
exclusively ?rst-year housing, 
kept emergency lighting with gas 
generators, but most essential 
utilities were disabled: outlets, 
lights, heat, hot water, internet 
and cable, and washers and 
dryers.
“I wanted to riot,” ?rst-year 
civil engineering major and 
Morewood resident Jared Hayes 
said in response to the power 
outage. Although said jokingly, 
this sentiment was telling of 
student attitudes about the loss 
of electricity, the disconnected 
routers and boilers inconve-
nient for the residents of these 
facilities.
Several residents took 
advantage of the otherwise 
unaffected campus, ?eeing 
across Forbes Avenue to take 
showers in the Cohon Center 
gym, braving temperatures as 
cold as 22°F the morning of these 
treks. First-year electrical and 
computer engineering major and 
Morewood resident, Breyden 
Wood, said that “I’ve dealt with 
cold water before, and I went 
into the [Morewood] shower to 
try and tough it out. And it was 
just colder than cold, so I had to 
go to the UC.”
First-year rowers, Morewood 
residents, and engineering 
majors Nicholas Acuna and 
Benjamin Pavlat may well have 
enjoyed the last of Morewood E-
Tower’s hot water that morning 
thanks to their 5:30 a.m. rowing 
practice. “The rowers get the hot 
water,” Nicholas joked. A good 
?fteen minutes of hot water that 
is, as Benjamin and Nicholas 
estimated.
Right next door, things 
became somewhat theatrical in 
Stever House, another site of 
the power outage. “The eleva-
tors did this weird thing where 
they let out this strange buzz-
ing sound, the doors stood wide 
open, and the lights were ?ick-
ering wildly. All of the doors of 
the building that are left open 
shut,” said Augustus Saalfeld, 
?rst-year information systems 
and creative writing major and 
Stever House resident. Accord-
ing to Saalfeld, disappointment 
swept the building when vending 
machines froze, but some 
students were relieved thanks to 
the good excuse to take a break 
from homework.
Beyond ?rst-year housing 
facilities and Carnegie Mellon’s 
campus, the outage affected 
much of the nearby area: 
streetlights along Fifth Avenue 
intersections, Walnut Street, and 
some Murray Street storefronts 
and apartments all lost power.
As for businesses, The 
Underground, a loved Carnegie 
Mellon dining and workspace in 
the Morewood basement, had to 
close due to the outages, reopen-
ing at around 4:00 p.m., seven 
-and-a-half hours after it typical-
ly opens. Manager Garrett Moran 
reported that the freezers luckily 
stayed on for the most part.
Even so, The Underground’s 
General Manager, J.R. Teyssier, 
estimated that $500 worth 
of food had to be thrown out 
due to the power outage, with 
$2,000 in lost business, which he 
considered an inconvenience for 
both the campus community — 
students looking for something 
to eat — and the restaurant itself.
Costs on Carnegie Mellon’s 
part, like heat restoration, were 
covered by everyday maintenance 
fees, with Duquesne Light 
responsible for bringing energy 
back to campus. At the height 
of the power outage, Duquesne 
Light was also responsible for 
restoring power to what may 
have been as many as 125,000 
customers across Allegheny and 
Beaver counties. Total damages 
included approximately 125 
downed poles and 500 downed 
wires.
Power returned to student 
housing at around 1:30 p.m. 
on the same day of the outage. 
Had the outage lasted into 
the evening, Carnegie Mellon 
Facilities Management and 
Campus Services and Residence 
Education were working on a 
backup plan to restore at least 
heating and hot water.
Wednesday, Feb. 27, two 
days after the outage, Executive 
Director of Housing Services & 
Space Planning, Thomas Cooley, 
said that “the CMU team worked 
well to get communications out 
to students with what they knew, 
and there are still people in the 
area without power today. Three 
buildings out of all our buildings 
is pretty small relative to the 
campus. Looking at the cam-
pus as a whole, the impact was 
minimal, which was something I 
was happy to see.”

Late last month, Carnegie 
Mellon University and Lockheed 
Martin entered a new stage of 
their longstanding research 
relationship in the signing of a 
new master research agreement, 
which aims to “guide future joint 
research projects and enable the 
organizations to respond quickly 
to new opportunities,” a Carnegie 
Mellon press release states.
This new agreement comes 
following over 30 years of 
collaboration with Lockheed 
Martin, a prominent aerospace, 
defense, security and advanced 
technologies company, and one 
of the world’s largest defense 
contractors.
Currently, no funding matters 
have been ?nalized, as the 
agreement is new, and as speci?c 
projects get funded separately.
At the signing event, Carnegie 
Mellon University vice president 
for research Michael McQuade 
stated that the university is 
“especially pleased that Lockheed 
Martin is joining our CMU AI eco-
system, advancing a technology 
that will be critical for our nation’s 
welfare.”
Lockheed Martin Vice 
President for Technology Strategy 
and Innovation Robie I. Samanta 
Roy stated at the event that 
“Lockheed Martin is making 
signi?cant investments in AI, so 
expanding our research partner-
ship with CMU was a natural 
next step that will help us to 
continue accelerating the pace 
of innovation and create next-
generation and generation-after-
next technologies.”
In an interview with The Tartan, 
McQuade expressed excitement 
in the ability of agreements like 
this one to “[create] a direct link 
to real-world experiences for 
our faculty and students,” and 
explained that it “is just one way 
that our faculty and students stay 
current on technology trends and 
continue to push the envelope of 
what is possible through research.”
He also explained that the

This past Saturday night, Lunar 
Gala, the long-anticipated fashion 
show of the year took place in the 
Cohon University Center. The goal 
of Lunar Gala is to showcase the 
creative exploration of Carnegie 
Mellon students through clothing, 
drawing inspiration from different 
aspects of life.
The show itself incorporated 
a variety of art forms, from visual 
to print to web motion design. The 
event’s reputation and popularity 
were evident in the fact that almost 
a thousand tickets sold out before 
the event, and the on the night 
of, the line stretched through-
out the entire ?rst ?oor of Cohon 
University Center.
Anna Gusman, the creative 
director of Lunar Gala, told The 
Tartan that the planning team 
started preparing for Lunar Gala 
ten months ago. The planning 
process was roughly divided into 
recruiting, advertising and prepar-
ing for the day of the show.
She explained that one of her 
most important jobs was to set the 
theme of this year. The team ended 
up choosing the word “Anomie”, 
which described “a condition of 
society that isolates the individual 
through the dissolution of commu-
nity”. This theme word was derived 
from “breeziness” and “honesty,” 
two common descriptors 
attributed to the boar — this year’s 
zodiac animal of the Lunar Cal-
endar. Based on this central idea, 
a production team consisting of 
more than 120 students unleashed 
their creativity.
The event started around 7:40 
p.m. As the light dimmed and the 
opening dancers infused the stage 
with abstract beauty, Lunar Gala 
models, wearing the realizations 
of designers’ innovative concepts, 
walked out one after another.
The concepts were greatly 
diverse from one another: Broqué, 
a pop culture take on baroque art; 
eden, addressing the degradation 
of Earth; Phantasus, inspired by 
the poem “They are not long” by 
Ernest Dowson; and Shibui, a 
Japanese concept emphasizing 
simple forms and pure beauty. A 
variety of fabrics were utilized, 
from cotton and nylon to resin 
and paper. Teaming up with 
professional makeup artists, 
Lunar Gala successfully allowed 
the beauty of their creativity to 
breathe through every single detail 
of the on-stage presentation.
Jessica Timczyk, a sophomore 
student in Dietrich working 
towards a self-de?ned degree, 
was both model coordinator and 
a model at Lunar Gala this year. 
She gave The Tartan insights to the 
rigorous model training: in order 
to achieve perfection on the night 
of the performance, the models 
trained for four hours per week 
from last August to this March.
“Coming into my job, one of 
the improvements I wanted to 
make was to cut the down time 
in these trainings and improve 
the ef?ciency of the model team.” 
As Timczyk further elaborated 
on her responsibilities, she noted 
the dif?culties in overcoming the 
barriers of communication across 
teams and handling the logistics of 
every detail.
But the passion she had for 
Lunar Gala overshadowed these 
problems she encountered. 
“Although a lot of hard work was 
required for this huge production, 
at the end of the day, I met some 
of my best friends in Lunar Gala, I 
enjoyed the camaraderie between 
Vincent Derienzo, Leah Kendrick, and Tyng Peck, the designers of  the envirometally-themed eden line, are presented with ?owers.
Morewood E-Tower, and The Underground below it, were among the affected spaces.

Special to The Tartan
Experiential learning, either 
through research opportunities 
or practical internships, has 
always been an integral as-
pect of Carnegie Mellon 
University’s mission for all its 
students. However, asymmetric 
information and the financial 
stress of registering for summer 
internship courses and summer 
research courses, in practice, act 
as systemic barriers against fully 
leveraging these opportunities, 
especially for our international 
students.
The Committee on Academic 
Affairs of the Undergraduate 
Student Senate, after realizing 
the importance of this issue 
based on student feedback, 
undertook this initiative, and 
after thoroughly researching the 
issue and obtaining stakeholder 
feedback, drafted a proposal.
The Committee has partnered 
with The Office of the Provost 
and the Office of the Vice Provost 
for Education in translating 
this set of student needs into 
feasible and implementable 
policies, compliant with federal 
regulations, with a holistic focus 
on affording all undergraduate 
students the option to benefit 
from these research and 
internship opportunities at as 
little additional cost as possible.
To that effect, Carnegie 
Mellon University established 
a “free” internship course 
that students can pursue by 
registering for a summer 
course to perform research 
for free. This draft proposal 
is being continuously refined 
and improved with constant 
feedback from all stakeholders, 
to ensure student needs are met.
As always, the Undergraduate 
Student Senate is happy to 
hear from our constituent 
community on the initiatives we 
undertake on their behalf. We 
look forward to incorporating 
additional student feedback 
in the proposals and in these 
discussions to ensure the 
best possible solutions are 
achieved. You can reach out 
to your college’s senators or

generally at student-senate@

master research agreement, now 
signed, “sets overall terms and 
conditions for future projects” but 
no “speci?c projects have been 
determined yet.”
Defense research partnerships 
like this one, and the recently 
launched Army AI Task Force, have 
raised concerns among students 
and faculty about research ethics 
and community input in research 
partnership choice.
McQuade stated that there 
is no mention of ethics in the 
agreement with Lockheed Martin, 
but that it would have been 
atypical for such a clause given 
that agreements like this one just 
set the “framework for terms and 
conditions between the sponsor 
and CMU.”
He holds that “CMU, as a 
world-class university, always 
takes into consideration the 
ethical and social impacts of 
everything it does. This is no 
exception. We never ask faculty or 
students to work on projects that 
they view as against their values.”
Before earning a position 
at Carnegie Mellon, McQuade 
served as the Senior Vice President 
for Science & Technology at 
United Technologies Corporation, 
which among other things, 
manufactured engines and 
systems for aircrafts, earning 
them around 10 percent of rev-
enue in government funding.
To this past experience in the 
defense sector, McQuade states it 
“provides useful insight into how 
industry partners want to engage 
with universities, their priorities 
and their emphasis on timeliness, 
and the real value they see in 
fundamental academic research,” 
but notes that his experience 
doesn’t apply to just defense 
partners.
Last month, Robert 
Strauss, a Carnegie Mellon 
professor of economics and 
public policy, explained to the 
Pittsburgh Post-Gazette that as 
the Army AI Task Force “occurred 
without internal CMU discussion 
[that I am aware of], shows that 
the line has blurred now.” He 
continued, “it re?ects a continued, 
accelerating decline in the faculty 
governance in the university.”
This new agreement with 
Lockheed Martin, though bearing 
many differences with the recently 
established Army AI Task Force, 
does raise similar community 
concerns in the militarization of 
Carnegie Mellon research.
McQuade defends the 
agreement by stating that 
Lockheed Martin were selected as 
a research partner after looking 
into a “wide range of factors,” 
but does not cite student insight 
as one of them. He cites faculty 
interest in the work of Lockheed 
Martin as one of the metrics 
considered.
“It is also important to note 
that Carnegie Mellon University 
faculty and students always 
have the ?exibility to pursue the 
research projects that best ful?ll 
their interests and curiosities. This 
ensures they have the freedom to 
participate, or not participate, in 
the initiatives of their choosing,” 
McQuade concluded.
This past week, McQuade was 
taking meetings at the Pentagon 
with “our sponsors in the DOD” 
and with “other government 
leaders” to “make sure CMU’s 
capabilities are viewed positively 
and that we are represented 
in the national dialogue about 
university research,” he said.
Whether partnerships like 
this one with Lockheed Martin 
are popular or unpopular 
among students and faculty, 
it does not appear that they 
will cease any time soon. Mc-
Quade assures the university, “I 
think this is very good for the 
university community and for 
our partners.”
“Concern” for Post-Gazette publisher 
JACOB PAUL
Layout Manager
On Saturday, Feb. 9, John 
Robinson Block, the publisher 
of the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, 
entered the newsroom 
intoxicated and shouting. In 
an apparent meltdown, Block 
went “berserk,” threatened 
employees, and “manhandled” 
his pre-teen daughter who was 
accompanying him.
The Pittsburgh Newspaper 
Guild has been engaged 
in contentious contract 
negotiations with the publisher. 
They have been working without 
a contract since March 31, 2017. 
For the second year in a row, 
the Blocks have refused to pay 
the five percent increase for 
the health insurance premium, 
which is required by contract and 
by federal law.
The newsroom posted a sign 
reading “Shame on the Blocks” in 
the newsroom in early December, 
after the Blocks announced that 
once again they would not be 
paying the increase.
On Friday, Feb. 9, Block 
threatened to close the paper 
if the sign was not taken down, 
according to multiple accounts 
published by the Pittsburgh News 
Guild. Reporters described him 
as “angry and irate,” “violent” 
and clearly “intoxicated.” He was 
“slapping and kicking” the wall.
Block attempted to pose his 
daughter for a photograph with 
it, and demanded that it run on 
“the front page of tomorrow’s 
paper,” according to the Post-
Gazette’s web editor, Marianne 
Mizera.
He “forcefully grabbed” his 
daughter, who was “crying, 
shaking and pleading.” Web 
editor Marianne Mizera, who 
was present at the time, reported 
that the publisher shouted at her 
“You’re a Block, don’t you forget 
it. You’re a Block you’re not one 
of them!”
“Do you want to be high 
class or low class?” he shouted, 
according to another employee 
statement. “You’re a Block, 
you’re one of us! You have to 
learn how to lead!” 
In the days after the incident 
John Robinson Block’s twin 
brother and the chairman Block 
Communications Inc., Allan 
Block, released a contradictory 
statement to Next Pittsburgh.
Allan Block’s statement 
addressed an “unfortunate 
exchange with employees,” 
which he attributed to the 
?nancial challenges of the news-
paper industry. He expressed re-
gret “if anyone present may have 
misconstrued what occurred as 
anything other than an indication 
of strong concern and support for 
the legacy and future of the Post-
Gazette.”
The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
was founded in 1786. The paper 
has been published by the Blocks 
family since 1927. John Robinson 
Block has been publisher since 
2002.
Last year the Post-Gazette 
published an editorial title 
“Reason as Racism,” defending 
President Trump’s comments 
about “sh-thole countries.” The 
editorial, which was published on 
Martin Luther King Jr. day, drew 
national criticism as “racist.” On 
Monday Feb. 18, The Post-Gazette 
named the editorial page director 
who wrote the controversial 
editorial, Keith C. Burris, as 
leader of the newsroom.
The Pittsburgh Newspaper 
Guild released four corroborating 
employee accounts in response 
to Allan Block’s statement. The 
Guild also ?led a complaint with 
the National Labor Relations 
Board.
Michael A. Fuoco, enterprise 
reporter and President of the 
Newspaper Guild, spoke with 
The Tartan to comment on the 
incident. He called it a “human 
crisis” that “had nothing to do 
with journalism.” Fuoco told 
The Tartan that “he should not 
be allowed back in the building 
until he received some type of 
evaluation that says he is not a 
threat to himself, his child, or his 
employees.”
Fuoco told NEXTpittsburgh 
that “We are very concerned 
for his safety and for ours.” He 
added that “given the statement 
issued by Allan Block, we 
no longer believe [company 
representatives] have the same 
empathy and concern for John 
Block’s mental health that we 
do.”
Shortly after the event 
the Guild sent out an email 
encouraging employees to work 
from home if they felt concerned 
for their safety, as reported by 
NEXTpittsburgh.
Yet Fuoco told The Tartan that 
“you won’t notice any drop off in 
the excellent journalism that we 
produce on a daily basis.”
Fuoco, who has been 
reporting at the Post-Gazette for 
35 years, said he was proud of the 
“high degree of professionalism 
exhibited by [his] colleagues.”
“There has not been any drop 
off in the way that we [do] our 
job.” said Fuoco. “There’s tension, 
but people are putting that aside 
to do our job. This is our calling, 
to be journalists. We went into 
this profession to report for our 
community, and will continue to 
do that until they close the doors. 
We hope they don’t.”Lockheed, CMU partner
Lunar Gala inspires in its 22nd annual show 
LOCKHEED, from A1
models through various bonding 
events, and I get to experience 
our ?nal production on stage, 
which was extremely thrilling and 
rewarding. These are the things 
that motivate me to keep coming 
back to the Lunar Gala,” she said.
“One word to describe 
Lunar Gala would be, ‘aston-
ishing’”, said creative director 
Anna Gusman, continuing, “I’m 
constantly astonished by how 
well the designers were able to 
create something from nothing. 
Astonished by how strange, beau-
tiful, different and dif?cult ev-
erybody’s work is and I feel very 
privileged to be able to weave it 
all together and guide that process 
into a cohesive vision.”
Furthermore, Anna was also 
“astonished” by the power of 
trust she learned through work-
ing with Lunar Gala’s huge pro-
duction team, she poetically con-
cluded how she was able to ful?ll 
her responsibility: “trusting in the 
absence of certainty is the most 
essential thing to do.”
Gusman’s astonishment also 
reached the audiences. During 
intermission, two senior neurosci-
ence students talked about being 
dazzled by the show. “Knowing 
some of the designers, hearing 
them talk about their ideas and 
then seeing the ideas actually 
comes to life on stage was incred-
ible to me,” said Cory Bird, one of 
the wowed students. He also made 
comments on this year’s U-shaped 
stage, saying “I think the stage 
design was crazy too, being able 
to incorporate the audience within 
the performances was really cool.”
Miranda Milencek, one of the 
aforementioned student attendees, 
talked about her amazement in the 
stories behind each designer’s line, 
noting that her favorite was “the 
one with all the reused materials 
from around campus. I think it 
conveyed a really impactful story 
with cool visuals,” referring to the 
Found line, in which sophomore 
Jessa Westheimer and ?rst-year 
Ashley Burbano used found 
objects around campus to sculpt 
garments.
In its 22nd year, Lunar Gala has 
become an in?uential uniting force 
that brings together talented stu-
dents across the campus to create 
a platform that celebrates each 
other’s unique creativity, igniting 
the passion for many others, not 
only in clothing design, but also in 
the pursuit of art and beauty.

The Tartan sparks discussion on climate change
SUJAY UTKARSH

The Shamima Begum case 
has been one that has sparked a 
huge controversy in the U.K. For 
those who don’t know, Shamima 
Begum was one of three teens 
who snuck out one night in 2015 
and ?ew to Syria to join ISIS. Cut 
to four years later: recently, she 
requested that she be allowed 
to return to the U.K. so she can 
raise her child safely, as ISIS is 
falling and her husband is in 
captivity. She also said she had 
no regrets for joining ISIS and 
wasn’t fazed by seeing severed 
heads. In response to this, the 
British government revoked her 
U.K. citizenship, but she will also 
not be allowed into Bangladesh 
since she does not have dual 
citizenship. In other words, she is 
stateless.
The only reason I could say 
she should be allowed back is that 
she was a British citizen when she 
left, and she is Britain’s problem, 
rather than any other country’s 
problem. She should face trial, 
and her child should be taken 
in by child protective services 
and given a chance to have a 
normal life. Leaving her stateless 
by taking away her citizenship 
is illegal, and it is unfair to just 
try and leave her to be someone 
else’s problem for the sake of 
pandering to right-wing stances. 
But the Begum case also brings up 
another question: is repatriating 
someone who joined a terrorist 
organization even possible in the 
?rst place?
I have been torn on this case. 
I thoroughly believe in being 
innocent until proven guilty, but 
that would imply that joining 
a terrorist organization isn’t a 
crime. That then leads to the 
question of whether joining a 
terrorist organization should be 
illegal or not. In the U.S., it is 
illegal due to a provision in the 
Patriot Act, but under U.K. law, 
it isn’t of?cially illegal. However, 
if she is allowed back to the U.K., 
she would face trial and likely 
be immediately incarcerated 
anyway. There is also the case to be 
made that perhaps she is a victim 
of circumstance. She was a child 
when she was radicalized, and 
her formative years were spent 
in a warzone being brainwashed. 
At that point, I drew the line. 
She knew what she was doing, 
so to say that she is a victim is 
pretty nonsensical. After a lot of 
deliberation, I concluded that 
her repatriation isn’t possible, 
and in general, repatriation of 
anyone who joined a terrorist 
organization isn’t feasible.
As far as criminal justice 
goes, I am a ?rm believer in 
rehabilitation and second 
chances rather than outright 
punishment. Repatriation would 
fall under this second-chance 
policy, but there are many 
issues with it. First, even if the 
individual hasn’t participated 
in any crimes themselves, they 
still joined an organization that 
is responsible for heinous crimes 
and is considered a foreign threat. 
So, in some sense, it is aiding and 
abetting, although it is for crimes 
committed in another country. 
Second, it is very dif?cult to 
judge whether someone actually 
committed a crime or not in the 
?rst place, beyond just joining. In 
a recent development, Begum’s 
husband said that he kept her 
as sheltered as possible from 
everything, but that contradicts 
Begum’s own claim of saying 
she isn’t fazed by seeing severed 
heads.
At the end of it all, I don’t think 
that those asking for repatriation 
are threats to national security 
or anything of the sort. I do 
believe that they could even be 
functioning members of society 
again if they were fully allowed 
back. But, those who joined made 
a choice, and knew that there 
was no turning back from their 
decision. Both Begum and her 
husband gave up their passports 
when they joined ISIS. Their 
choice should have consequences, 
and there shouldn’t be any 
sympathy for them if they 
realized they made a mistake by 
joining ISIS. Those who are being 
radicalized should see this as a 
message. They should know what 
they are getting themselves into. 
They are free to do that, but they 
shouldn’t expect forgiveness for 
making a bad decision.
Can repatriation actually be done?
Shamima Begum is currently stateless after having her UK citizenship revoked.

In last week’s issue, our SciTech 
editor, Ashwin Srinivasan, wrote 
about a Cambridge study showing 
the degree to which the arctic ice 
shelves were breaking up due to 
global warming. It was a good 
article and received positive 
responses from all we knew who 
read it.
The Tartan has dabbled in 
coverage of climate change, 
especially in our SciTech and 
Forum sections, but it lacks the 
consistency with which we write 
about other high-pro?le topics 
like gun control or the baf?ing 
resurgence of diseases from anti-
vaccination trends. As an Editorial 
Board, we agree that climate 
change, and a lack of action to 
combat it, is an existential crisis 
that deserves consistent coverage 
on our pages.
We decided it would be worth it 
to try exploring, in a public space, 
some of the reasons why this topic 
in particular is easy to forget to 
talk about, some of the ways we 
can possibly rectify it, and why it is 
particularly important to continue 
to boost student conversation 
about it here at Carnegie Mellon.
This problem is not limited to 
just The Tartan, or media coverage 
in general. But the way that we 
think about the stories we write 
can be used to think about what 
we do.
A Columbia Journalism Review 
article found that climate stories 
in 2018 were often dominated by 
“hard news” coverage, or coverage 
that centered around a speci?c 
event or report. Understanding the 
workings of climate change on a 
macro level is a scienti?c endeavor. 
It would be irresponsible for non-
expert journalists to just speculate 
about the effects of climate 
change, so it follows naturally that 
the coverage of climate change 
usually follows big, blockbuster 
studies or huge meta analyses of 
existing literature.
Often, those reports provide 
material that shape how scared 
we ought to be of some impending 
crisis. Notably last year, the 
Intergovernmental Panel on 
Climate Change released a report 
which found the predicted date 
for 1.5°C of warming 
to be somewhere between 2030 
and 2052, which is the ?gure that 
has been agreed upon as a crisis 
level of warming, spurring global 
consequences. Furthermore, the 
National Climate Assessment 
released by the White House 
chronicled how climate change 
might affect natural disasters 
across the U.S.
These kinds of hard science 
reports are few and far between, 
as exempli?ed by the fact that 
the last year brought somewhere 
around two. And hard news 
coverage is dif?cult to do here at 
The Tartan since we keep our news 
section strictly Carnegie Mellon-
related. Writers and editors also 
sometimes struggle to link events 
on campus or in Pittsburgh to 
individual international reports.
But climate change is an issue 
that affects the student body, 
and considering that we, as an 
institution, are meant to serve and 
inform the student body, we ought 
to be directing more attention to 
it.
As mostly young people, we 
will likely be alive in the critical 
climate period which may seem 
abstract to some, “2030 to 2052.” 
Even though this is an overly 
repeated point in climate change 
activism, to the point that it may 
feel a little guilt-inducing to older 
folks, it is actually true that people 
will feel the effects of a continuous 
disaster in different ways.
Though it might take a couple 
decades for people in this speci?c 
region to feel the effects of global 
climate change, there are places 
where the effect on natural 
disasters and natural resources 
has already created terrible effects 
in the lives of millions. An average 
of 24 million people are displaced 
every year by climate disasters.
But we ask not what effect 
climate change might have on 
Carnegie Mellon students, but 
instead what effect that Carnegie 
Mellon students might have on 
climate change.
It’s easy to ?nd examples of 
conservation on campus. For 
instance, the Tepper Quad and 
Gates have composting in their 
food locations, and that the Green 
Practices Committee is thinking 
about the ways in which we can 
reduce waste on campus. But the 
bulk of pollution in the world is 
not happening on the Carnegie 
Mellon campus, or indeed from 
direct consumer waste at all.
The ways we can best in?uence 
the direction the world is heading 
in regards to climate change is 
what we do after graduating. 
There are obviously those who 
spend their time here majoring 
in something like Environmental 
Policy or Engineering and Public 
Policy and go on to deal more 
directly with environmental issues 
in the policy sphere or in research. 
There are courses offered every 
semester that deal with the 
environment and energy policy. 
But even those who choose an 
entirely different path will enter 
careers that will directly affect 
pollution and energy consumption 
on a global scale.
According to a survey by 
the Career and Professional 
Development Center, the top 
hiring companies of the Carnegie 
Mellon class of 2018 were tech 
companies like Amazon, Apple 
and Google, consulting ?rms 
like Deloitte or Pricewaterhouse 
Coopers, or ?nancial institutions 
like Goldman Sachs or Capital 
One. Furthermore, much of the 
funding for research at Carnegie 
Mellon goes to military groups or 
military contractors.
These students will go on 
to make decisions about how 
products are shipped around the 
world, how hazardous materials 
are dealt with, how to invest 
in fossil fuels or how weapons 
cause lasting environmental 
devastation overseas. To this end, 
students should not recognize 
understanding climate change as 
something that is separate from 
their area of study, but instead 
as something that they are 
choosing not to weave into their 
understanding of the world.
As students that, according to 
the 2025 strategic plan, ought to 
“recognize, frame and address 
complex problems; the capacity 
to combine re?ection with 
appropriate action; the ability 
to communicate effectively,” we 
should not shy away from tackling 
an issue like climate 
change just because 
its global effects are 
hard to consider in 
the context of your 
personal actions 
and in?uence.
At The Tartan, 
we want to embrace 
this challenge by 
writing pieces 
that attempt to 
look at what we 
can in?uence and 
change in our 
own community. 
Sometimes we 
will struggle to talk 
about its effects in 
the context of our 
sometimes sheltered 
campus. Instead, 
we must try to talk 
about some causes 
that may be rooted 
here. We applaud 
students and 
campus community 
members who are 
addressing these 
issues in their 
own work, and we 
encourage others to 
consider their work 
in that context.Emily Giedzinski/Staff Artist

Cohen and growing partisanship
ATAHAN KILICCOTE
Junior Staffwriter
This past Wednesday, 
Michael Cohen, personal lawyer 
to President Trump, gave his 
testimony before the House 
Oversight and Reform Committee. 
In his testimony, Cohen called 
Trump a “racist,” a “con man” 
and a “cheat.” According to 
Vice, Cohen implicated Trump 
in 11 different felonies “from 
potential involvement in a grand 
Russia conspiracy to pilfering 
money from his own charitable 
foundation.”
This was a very polarizing 
event. Vocal Democrats have 
been pushing for impeachment 
since the ?rst inklings of collusion 
surfaced, and this testimony seems 
to validate those claims. On the 
other hand, Republicans continue 
to rally behind the president, 
attacking Cohen’s character and 
motivations. This environment put 
a bright spotlight on the members 
of the committee. Their questions 
and actions would be watched and 
recorded by their constituents, 
and a wrong step could spell 
disaster for the next election cycle, 
where rising Democratic support 
threatens to dislodge even the 
safest Republican seats.
I don’t want to write about the 
controversial testimony of Mr. 
Cohen. Instead, I want to focus on 
the actions of the members of the 
committee, speci?cally the form 
and content of their questions.
Committee members are 
like anyone else in a democratic 
political of?ce: the most important 
thing to them is getting reelected. 
For this reason, high pro?le 
committee meetings are a way for 
politicians in the House to make a 
name for themselves and connect 
to their constituents. They need 
to present themselves as relatable 
in order to show that they are 
representing their voter base. 
Because of this, the questions 
they ask are based on politics, 
constructed to bene?t the image 
of the of?cial instead of advancing 
the goal of the committee. This 
is even more pronounced in 
polarized, high-pro?le committee 
meetings. In this environment, 
freshman Democratic House 
representative Alexandria Ocasio-
Cortez — commonly referred to as 
AOC — de?es the norm.
Republicans play a similar 
game every time in these House 
committees. They try to appeal to 
three different images: strength, 
relatability, and morality. First, to 
show strength, they will get red-
faced and angry. Raising their 
voice, bullying, and suppressing 
arguments are what winners 
do, so they do it too. In this 
hearing, many Republicans said 
to Cohen, “it’s my [question] 
time, not yours!” silencing him 
and continuing their questions. 
Second, Republicans try to be 
relatable and understandable 
by speaking in metaphors. In a 
famous hearing, one Republican 
evoked the image of a bull stuck 
in a house to explain the debt 
problem. Third, they show 
their morality and piousness by 
referring to their time in the army, 
the police force, or as a minister. 
These narratives are not at all 
related to the committee hearing 
at hand or the current problems 
facing the nation. Instead, they 
are constructed to present a 
caricature that appeals to their 
voter base.
Democrats are very similar; the 
major difference is that their voter 
base is oppositely polarized. First, 
they still want to appear as strong, 
but they present it as staying 
calm and aloof. Democrats who 
yell and get red-faced are seen as 
weaker than those who maintain 
a quiet, authoritative presence. 
Second, they still want to be 
relatable, but they accomplish this 
by bringing up understandable 
issues and rhetoric that appear in 
liberal media. This is because the 
Democratic voter base is informed 
by this media. Democrats tend 
to quote journalism, while 
Republicans like to bring up new 
issues that they can “own” and put 
their name on. Third, they act as 
though they are moral, just like 
Republicans do. All this is further 
evidence for the theater that 
lawmakers engage in. Especially 
in the House, where elections 
happen more often, it is especially 
important that committee 
members make a big name for 
themselves.
In all this, AOC de?es the 
norms. In her short ?ve-minute 
question time with Cohen, AOC 
implicated Trump in tax fraud, 
linked crimes to Trump associates, 
and brought forth a scheme to 
basically steal public funds. She 
still did many of the same things 
as her Democratic colleagues, but 
she toned it down considerably. 
The only time she pandered to 
her voters was in a short exchange 
where she referred to a Trump 
golf course, “near [her] home 
borough of the Bronx,” which she 
drives past “every day” creating 
the image of her connectedness 
to the community. Other than 
this, she conducted what has 
been referred to as a “surgical 
strike” of questions. She knew 
what information she wanted 
to get and how to get it, and she 
didn’t waste time with decorum 
and image manufacturing. 
This is the strength of the new-
wave Democrats: they create an 
appealing image by doing what 
needs to be done and making 
the government seem ef?cient 
and effective. Instead of having 
to spend their time pandering 
and puf?ng up their feathers, 
new young Democrats can create 
change, and get reelected because 
that’s what the new voters like.
President Trump’s former lawyer, Michael Cohen, has recently undergone a hearing that caught international attention.

On Jan. 24, Kynesha Grant 
died from complications from a 
brain tumor in the custody of a 
state corrections facility outside 
of Erie, Pennsylvania. On Dec. 28, 
Grant had a doctor’s appointment 
canceled. Two days later, she was 
unresponsive during roll call, and 
she faced a 15 day punishment 
that caused her Jan. 9 request for 
a CT scan to be denied. Five days 
later, she ?led another request 
for a CT scan that said “I am very 
tired of suffering. I need some 
help. Please.”
It took until Jan. 23 for Grant 
to be taken to a hospital. For two 
years, she complained of crippling 
headaches, and the corrections 
facility kept insisting that she 
allow her medication — Topamax, 
a common migraine medication 
— to take effect. Since her death 
a little over a month ago, Grant’s 
friends, fellow inmates, and 
relatives are pushing for reform in 
the justice system because of the 
unfair treatment Grant faced.
Early in Feb., a detention 
center in Brooklyn lost heat, light, 
and hot water. The inmates were 
all kept under lockdown, and 
the utilities were in a state of 
dysfunction for almost an entire 
week. A few days before that, 
and just a few days after Grant’s 
passing, there were reports of an 
inmate in Indiana who died in 
police custody. Before that, there 
were reports of inmates dying for 
various reasons in Spring?eld, 
Massachusetts, Oklahoma 
County, Oklahoma, and Orleans 
Parish, Louisiana. These ?ve who 
died in police custody were in their 
20’s or 30’s with a drug addiction 
— from prescription medication 
to opiates — that landed them 
in prison, and none of them were 
given proper medical treatment.
There are a few other issues 
with the current prison system. 
A recent Congressional report 
stated that there was a culture of 
rampant sexual harassment and 
assault in federal prison systems. 
The United States holds the most 
prisoners out of any nation on the 
planet, around 500,000 people 
more than an autocratic nation 
with three times our population. 
One in ?ve of those prisoners 
are locked up for non-violent 
drug offenses, with most being 
held in state or local jails: at best, 
low-level dealers in much larger 
systems. And the people held in 
custody can be forced to work 
for pennies on the hour, which 
includes all of the immigrants in 
ICE detention centers. 465,000 
people are held without a 
conviction according to the Prison 
Policy Initiative.
The United States is dependent 
on the incarceration of millions 
for an industry that is worth 
$629 million in pro?t last 
year according to NBC. That 
means each private, federal 
prison, supposedly centers of 
rehabilitation and reintegration, 
made around $60 million in pro?t 
last year. Prison workers are often 
forced to manufacture products 
for the parent company of the 
private prison corporation, and 
those products are sold for the 
pro?t of the investors. At best, the 
system takes advantage of people 
in disadvantaged positions, and 
at worst, it systemically robs 
millions of their livelihoods, and 
thousands of their lives.
I can go on with statistics 
and journalism about the 
lack of accountability that the 
criminal justice system has 
faced for their role in harming 
prisoners. Ultimately, the political 
question comes down to a moral 
question that is dependent on a 
belief in the role of prison. Are 
prisons designed to rehabilitate 
prisoners? Are jails reserved 
for those who have a legitimate 
possibility of committing the 
crime? And is it ethical to make a 
pro?t on the prison system?
I think that, at the least, there 
need to be major overhauls of 
the prison system to ensure that 
loss of life is minimized. But it’s 
also unethical to pro?t from the 
punishment of a person. To say 
that a person deserves to be paid 
slave wages for their production 
while investors and middle-
management live their lives 
comfortably, yet the prisoners 
making the products live in 
squalor and danger is unethical. 
People’s lives are at risk while 
they are incarcerated for crimes, 
and the sentences they serve 
should not end up killing them. 
Grant was in prison for forging 
pain medication prescriptions, 
and the argument for the prison 
system suggests that she would 
not have died if she had not gone 
to prison.
However, the individual 
is created out of a multitude 
of environmental factors that 
predispose a monetary need, 
ease of revenue creation, and a 
relative morality that isn’t too 
different from our legally allowed 
immoral experience. The Sackler 
family sold opioids on a massive 
scale that has harmed millions of 
people, but Grant is given fewer 
rights because of her status as a 
prisoner. Kynesha Grant dies in 
police custody, and the Sackler 
family is ?ned for their role in the 
opioid crisis, with their names 
still on buildings. To say there is 
any similarity in the cases, to say 
that Grant got what was coming 
to her, is to establish a false moral 
equivalence.

North Korea-U.S. Summit 2.0: negotiations continue
FRANK HU
Operations Manager
Originally planned as a two-
day event, the most recent summit 
between the U.S. and North Korea 
ended abruptly ahead of schedule, 
with President Trump claiming 
that the talks had run aground 
due to President Kim Jong-Un’s 
unreasonable demands to lift all 
current economic sanctions in 
exchange for closing the Yongbyon 
nuclear facility, a key research and 
production site. This is the second 
meeting between Trump and Kim, 
a follow up to their ?rst summit 
in Singapore, which was the ?rst 
time a sitting U.S. president had 
met in person with a North Korean 
leader.
At the outset, the summit 
seemed promising. Unlike past 
presidents, Trump appears to have 
a good rapport with Kim, with 
the two frequently exchanging 
letters and showering each other 
with praise. Indeed, each summit 
has been marked with excessive 
pageantry and constant ?attery, 
each leader playing to the other’s 
ego and projecting an image of 
friendship and collaboration 
that feels worlds apart from the 
in?ammatory rhetoric of the past.
Although it is worrying that 
the current president is so willing 
to trust and defend dictators and 
autocrats (Trump has similarly 
espoused his closeness with 
Russian president Vladimir Putin), 
there were hopes that the apparent 
camaraderie between two of the 
most aggressive leaders in the 
world would lead to a deal that 
not only tackled the complicated 
issue of denuclearization, but 
would also end the Korean War 
and help ease tensions on the 
Korean peninsula. There was also 
a marked shift in Kim’s priorities 
for his nation: while he previously 
focused on reinforcing North 
Korea’s nuclear and military 
power, he is now looking towards 
the future, hoping to bring his 
country back onto the world 
stage and earn the respect of the 
international community. After all, 
remaining an isolated country in 
the 21st century is a disadvantage, 
and Kim realizes that modern 
prosperity is inextricably linked to 
globalization.
In the end, little progress was 
made and the summit failed to 
live up to the hype, although this 
is hardly surprising. Lifting all 
economic sanctions in exchange 
for the shutdown of one nuclear 
facility is a deal that decidedly 
favored North Korea, since the 
nation possesses other research 
centers and a stockpile of missiles 
and bombs, products of its long-
running nuclear program. To 
accept the deal would have shifted 
the balance of power and allowed 
North Korea to increase in power 
and in?uence, while continuing to 
maintain its arsenal. North Korea 
n of?cials contest Trump’s claims, 
saying that the demands were not 
nearly as extreme, but regardless 
of whether the president was 
exaggerating, conceding one 
nuclear center out of many for 
the removal of sanctions is an 
unfair bargain. In that sense, 
walking away is still better than a 
concession.
The path moving forward 
with North Korea is riddled 
with uncertainty, as a second 
inconclusive summit has damaged 
the relationship between the two 
nations. While Trump continues 
to remain enthusiastic about his 
ties with Kim, claiming that the 
two remained very good friends 
and allies, Kim claims that he has 
lost some of his desire to negotiate 
with the U.S., and that if a deal 
cannot be reached, he will seek 
other avenues that circumvent 
Washington entirely.
How future negotiations will 
play out remains to be seen, but one 
thing that the U.S. needs to keep 
in mind is that they do not have 
the upper hand in this situation. 
The fact that Kim is willing to 
negotiate at all is evidence that 
North Korea has already solidi?ed 
its nuclear power, so advancing 
their weaponry is no longer the top 
priority. Because of the country’s 
past conduct, there is not much 
that past U.S. administrations 
and the international community 
could have done beyond sanctions, 
as Kim uses the threat of nuclear 
war to ensure that he retains his 
position of power, well aware that 
no one would be willing to spark 
catastrophic annihilation.
A key part of North Korea’s 
continued survival is its support 
from China, which provides the 
country with food and fuel, acting 
as their biggest trade partner. 
While China has historically 
supported North Korea’s regimes, 
they have gradually shifted 
towards condemnation, seeing the 
country’s nuclear development 
as a threat to peace. Yet despite 
these concerns, the two countries 
continue to maintain close 
economic ties, in effect enabling 
North Korea’s continued de?ance 
of international accords, despite 
the heavy sanctions.
America’s relationship with 
China is a complicated one 
given the ongoing trade-war, 
which hurts the possibility 
of collaboration between the 
two nations. While China is 
one of the biggest economic 
competitors to the U.S. and has 
done questionable things in the 
past, it and North Korea might 
have to consider a joint approach 
to try to denuclearize North 
Korea. By disconnecting North 
Korea from its closest ally and 
supporter, it is conceivable that 
the impoverished country would 
be more receptive to outside 
demands. Of course, China is 
unlikely to stop trade with North 
Korea, but it has become clear that 
direct U.S. confrontation with 
North Korea is unlikely to resolve 
the problem, and international 
rebukes are similarly ineffective; 
denuclearizing North Korea and 
stabilizing the peninsula is a 
complex problem that requires 
new and multilateral solutions.
Hopefully, negotiation and 
communication between the U.S. 
and North Korea will continue, as 
nothing’s worse than letting evil 
fester in darkness. If the Trump 
administration wishes to make any 
signi?cant headway, they need to 
rethink their strategy and draw 
on the support of other nations 
to present a united and tangible 
front. International condemnation 
and American intervention have 
not worked in the past and likely 
will not work in the future: there 
needs to be a different approach 
if we wish to resolve one of the 
most dangerous and complicated 
imbroglios in foreign policy.

With each generation of new 
cellular network technology, 
engineers have tried to eliminate 
security ?aws that plagued the 
earlier version. Third generation 
networks were vulnerable 
to an exploit in Signaling 
System 7, a protocol used by 
telecommunications companies 
to route text messages and 
phone calls. 4G was designed to 
mitigate these ?aws, but recent 
studies have found that it is just 
as vulnerability-ridden as its 
predecessor. Now, researchers 
have discovered a new issue in 4G 
and the upcoming 5G technology 
that allows attackers to intercept 
phone calls, text messages, and 
track users’ locations in real-time.
In a paper presented at the 
Network and Distributed System 
Security Symposium in San 
Diego on Feb. 26, researchers 
from Purdue University and the 
University of Iowa revealed 
Torpedo, an exploit in the 
paging protocol that mobile 
carriers use to notify devices 
of incoming calls and texts. 
Several phone calls placed 
and cancelled within a short 
interval allow a 
hacker to 
send a faux paging message, track 
a user’s location, and hijack the 
paging channel to inject or deny 
messages. Additionally, Torpedo 
puts even the latest 5G devices 
at risk from Stingrays, fake cell 
networks used by law enforcement 
of?cials to survey phones in an 
area and log users’ locations.
According to Syed Ra?ul 
Hussain, one of the co-authors of 
the paper, all four major carriers in 
the United States, as well as most 
networks in Europe and Asia, are 
affected by Torpedo. “Any person 
with a little knowledge of cellular 
paging protocols can carry out 
this attack… such as phone call 
interception, location tracking, 
or targeted phishing attacks,” 
Hussain told TechCrunch. It 
would only take $200 of radio 
equipment, but the researchers 
refuse to provide proof-of-concept 
code due to the nature of the ?aws.
The vulnerabilities were 
reported to the GSMA, the industry 
body that represents mobile 
phone carriers. However, the 
GSMA has not responded to 
the study, and a ?x could 
take months or even a 
new generation of cellular 
technology.

Microsoft U.S. military contract draws backlash from employees
TRENTO VON LINDENBERG
Junior Staffwriter
If you’ve ever read or seen 
Ender’s Game, then the concept 
of using video games as a form 
of warfare may not be foreign to 
you. Since their inception, the 
presence of violence in video 
games have inspired all sorts 
of concerns: do games incite 
violence in children? Are children 
who play violent games becoming 
desensitized to violence? Or 
could war, real-life war, become 
nothing more than a video game, 
as in Ender’s Game?
Whether you believe it could 
happen or not, as of Friday, Feb. 
22, some employees at Microsoft 
think it might be more truth 
than ?ction. In a letter written 
to Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, 
around 50 workers demanded 
that the company break off a 
contract with the U.S. Army 
that provided the military with 
HoloLens augmented reality 
headsets.
The concern was that the 
HoloLens could turn warfare into 
a “simulated ‘video game,’ further 
distancing soldiers from… the 
reality of bloodshed.” Indeed, 
according to research by The 
Washington Post, the military 
planned to use augmented reality 
to “supercharge” its soldiers; 
they hoped soldiers could use 
the headsets for navigation, 
identify hostile threats (including 
explosives), and even track 
biometrics.
This is not the ?rst time 
Microsoft has dealt with internal 
strife over their decades-long 
dealings with the military: in 
June of 2018, workers demanded 
via an open letter that Microsoft 
back out of a contract to provide 
Immigration and Customs 
Enforcement (ICE) with cloud-
computing and AI software. 
In that letter, they wrote that 
they represented a “growing 
movement” of workers who 
believe their work should be 
“used for good, not for harm.” 
Similarly, the most recent letter 
was titled “HoloLens for good, 
not war,” posted by the Microsoft 
Workers 4 Good group.
The heart of the matter can 
be summed up in this line: “as 
employees and shareholders 
we do not want to become war 
pro?teers.” Employees feel that 
Microsoft is in a position to make a 
choice, determining the morality 
and ethics of the company. The 
vision of the HoloLens was to 
create a device that could help 
people build, learn, and play. But 
when used as a tool for war, that 
vision is tainted.
While employees who are un-
comfortable working on a project 
due to ethical reasons can transfer 
to other projects within the 
company, the Microsoft Workers 
4 Good believe that it ignores 
the key issue: employees are not 
“properly informed of the use of 
their work.”
Although it is unlikely that 
Microsoft will pull out of a $479 
million contract at the behest of a 
handful of employees, the protest 
still sets an unusual precedent in 
an industry ruled by tech giants. 
Historically, workers at companies 
like Microsoft, Amazon, and 
Google have had little impact on 
what was done with the products 
they helped make.
In recent years, however, 
this trend has started to shift. 
Amazon is a notable (and recent) 
example: after choosing to build 
their second headquarters in 
Long Island City, the company 
was forced to look elsewhere 
after local workers protested. 
Additionally, a Google employee 
walkout and an open letter at 
Amazon against military research 
have seen some success in 
in?uencing company decisions.
Moving forward, it’s possible 
that the rising activism seen 
across the industry will inspire 
people to make their voices 
heard. Likewise, as tech giants 
feel a growing pressure to respect 
the wishes of their employees, 
petitions and open letters like 
these might start to bear more 
weight.

Many believe that taking an 
online stance on social issues is 
important — but does it ever feel 
like tweeting into the void? What’s 
the point, anyway? Can you really 
change anyone’s mind with 280 
characters?
Well, you might. A study this 
month from the University of 
Kansas found that a very small 
number of tweets changed viewers’ 
beliefs about a social controversy. 
However, the race of the person 
tweeting can have an impact on 
white readers’ perception of what 
issue the tweet is about.
Mass communications re-
searchers Joseph Erba, Yuchen 
Liu, and Mugur Geana from 
the School of Journalism and 
Mass Communications set out 
to determine how users see race 
when a social controversy is being 
discussed on Twitter. “We were 
interested to see…if the visual 
identi?cation of a Twitter user 
in?uences how people perceive 
the message,” said Erba.
“It does.”
As a test case, the team chose 
the national anthem kneeling 
protests initiated by football 
player Colin Kaepernick in 2016, 
a controversy with strong racial 
overtones.
The researchers showed white 
participants real tweets about the 
protests, paired with constructed 
Twitter identities that displayed 
the writer of the tweet as a white 
man, a white woman, a black 
man, or a black woman. Each 
participant saw tweets that were 
either for or against the protest.
In a straightforward pre- and 
post-test setup, participants 
answered questions about the 
protest, as well as their opinions 
on race. They also rated which 
pro?les they believed to be most 
credible, and whose opinions they 
would seek out on the topic. Most 
participants reported that they 
would be most likely to seek out 
the opinions of black men.
But experimental data from 
eye-tracking software told a 
different story. White participants 
spent the most time looking at 
tweets from white people, and 
especially white men.
“Forty percent of white 
millennials voted for Trump,” said 
Elba. “In the study, they looked 
more at people who looked like 
them, but when asked directly, 
said they supported black men.” 
The researchers pointed to this 
result as a warning against giving 
too much weight to self-reported 
data.
The study’s post-test also 
found that participants’ views 
on the protests largely changed 
depending on which group of 
tweets they read. Anti-protest 
tweets decreased their support, 
while tweets in support of the 
protests gave participants a more 
favorable view.
“Four little tweets were enough 
to signi?cantly change their views 
on the NFL protests. We did not 
?nd a difference in their attitudes 
toward black people or racism 
though,” Erba said. “We think 
it was because the tweets were 
directly about the protests, and 
making the connection to larger 
issues may have just been too 
much.”
The research will be 
presented at the International 
Communication Association con-
ference in May.

The Hubble Space Telescope 
was a technological achievement 
that gave humanity a clearer 
view of the deep cosmos than 
ever before. Now, NASA plans 
to launch a new telescope 
called the Wide Field Infrared 
Survey Telescope (WFIRST) 
that will hunt for new planets 
and research the nature of dark 
energy, continuing the work 
done by its predecessor Kepler.
According to a study by a team 
of astronomers at Ohio State 
University, the potential reach 
of the new telescope is quite 
impressive. What distinguishes 
WFIRST from past telescope 
designs is that it leverages 
the technique of gravitational 
microlensing, which depends on 
the gravity of stars and planets 
to bend and magnify the light 
from stars passing behind them. 
This will allow WFIRST to 
detect planets farther away from 
their host stars, leading to the 
potential discovery of over 1,000 
more planets. Furthermore, 
around 100 of those soon-to-be 
discovered planets may have a 
mass lower than or similar to that 
of Earth.
Compared to past projects, 
WFIRST represents a signi?cant 
improvement. Although it is set 
to continuously scan only a small 
portion of the sky — no more than 
two square degrees — it is still an 
appreciably larger area than past 
telescopes were capable of, and 
at a higher resolution as well. 
In addition, the WFIRST will 
include infrared imaging, which 
will allow the telescope to see 
through clouds of cosmic dust, 
making it possible to accurately 
survey areas of the sky that are 
more densely packed with stars 
and previously inaccessible to 
optical telescopes.
The discovery of new planets 
can not only lead to a greater 
understanding of the structure 
of our galaxy, but also help us 
understand better the origins of 
our universe, and the mechanics 
that shape stars and planets and 
solar systems similar to ours. 
Perhaps when deep space travel 
becomes feasible, we may visit 
and seek to colonize these planets 
if they’re similar enough to Earth, 
something that scientists have 
dreamt of for decades.
For now, the WFIRST project 
is still in its initial planning 
stages. NASA ?rst announced 
plans to move forward with the 
initiative in Feb. 2016 and began 
planning in May 2018. It may be a 
quite a few years before WFIRST 
takes ?ight, but when it does, 
we will gain an exciting new 
perspective on the nature and 
behavior of distant planets, and 
it will reinforce the notion that 
space is not nearly as empty as we 
once thought it was.

Machado, then Harper, sign big contracts with Padres, PhilliesPenalty Shouts: the future of the NCAA
Williamson gets hurt: what it means for college athletes
GRANT LI
Junior Staffwriter
Zion Williamson is the name 
of a 6 foot 7 inch, 284 pound 
man who is widely regarded as 
the best basketball prospect of 
this generation. Don’t let those 
numbers deceive you — he’s 
famous for absurd athleticism 
and flashy dunks.
Currently, Williamson plays 
for Duke University on one of the 
best college basketball teams ever 
assembled, on paper. The team 
was practically unstoppable until 
Feb. 20, when 33 seconds into a 
game against rival University of 
North Carolina at Chapel-Hill, 
Williamson’s left foot ripped 
through his shoe. He ended up 
leaving the game with a knee 
sprain. Duke went on to lose 
that game and another against 
Virginia Tech in the three games 
played since.
The injury has reignited a 
debate surrounding college 
athletes: should they be paid? 
Many are calling for them to 
have some sort of salary, or have 
expressed frustration at the 
“one-and-done” rule, where high 
school players are essentially 
coerced into playing a year in 
college before they’re allowed 
to declare for the NBA draft. 
Many regarded Zion as the #1 
overall pick, had it been possible 
for him to declare out of high 
school. Unfortunately, he had 
to risk injury by playing college 
basketball, and that risk has 
become a reality.
While the debate about 
paying college athletes is 
overwhelmingly complex, the 
“one-and-done” debacle might 
soon be resolved. The NBA 
notified teams last October that 
high school players can declare 
as soon as the 2022 draft. 
Coincidentally, at almost the 
same time of Williamson’s injury, 
it was reported and confirmed 
that the NBA was proposing to 
abolish the “one-and-done rule.”
Additionally, the NBA G 
League (the development 
league), recently announced 
the Select Contract, where elite 
high school players can sign for 
$125,000 through a five month 
season. This is good news, as it 
will potentially draw in more 
talent, since one of the issues in 
the past was that the competition 
was arguably not as strong as the 
college scene.
Another option is to play 
overseas. Recently, the NBA has 
seen an influx of exceptional 
players from Europe and 
elsewhere, like Kristaps 
Porzingis, Luka Doncic, and 
Giannis Antetokounmpo. As 
these players become stars, 
hopefully more high school 
athletes will begin to see it as 
a viable option. Despite the 
complications that come with 
living alone in a foreign country 
as an 18 year old, players can be 
paid for their time there.
Ideally, NBA teams should 
have academies like top soccer 
clubs do (and in European 
basketball), where talented kids 
play in a development system 
that gives them an education 
and a path to the top flight for 
those as young as 16. This is 
regrettably unlikely to happen, 
and the best potential scenario 
would be for the G League to grow 
larger than the NCAA. In many 
ways the G League is close — had 
Zion Williamson signed into the 
G League, it wouldn’t have been 
far from the imagination to see 
the G League as a prime-time 
affair. $125,000 is already a lot 
more than a free year of tuition, 
and the Select Contract program 
includes life mentorship and 
other developmental implements 
as well. Perhaps it should be said 
that the NCAA is the last place 
where we should give our money 
to, and the last place Williamson 
should lend his talents.
March Madness is just around 
the corner, and we’ll have to see if 
Williamson plays the remainder 
of the season or decides to not 
risk injury again and prepare for 
the draft. For now, all basketball 
fans will be wishing him a speedy 
recovery because a once-in-a-
generation talent deserves to play.

This is Penalty Shouts, The 
Tartan’s sports column inspired 
by the The New Yorker’s column 
Daily Shouts. This satire-fueled 
column will focus on anything 
and everything funny in the sports 
world that is deserving of our 
comedic attention.
 Last week, I wrote about 
Robert Kraft, and most of it 
came from a place of anger at 
the way the system works. Good 
comedy rarely stems from a 
place of anger, so I’m going to 
return to the origins of this here 
column: basketball.
In the NCAA, conference 
tournaments are getting started 
this week. And the Atlantic Sun, 
or as I like to say, Atlantic Buns, 
Conference kicks it all off. One of 
the first matches is between No-
Name Middle State University 
(N-NMSU) and Lipscomb. 
John Smith of N-NMSU has at 
least one double-double this 
season, and he is looking to 
add one more to the total over 
the course of the conference 
tournament. According to their 
local publication, The Where Am 
I? Tribune, Smith believes that a 
strong performance during the 
conference tournament might 
earn him a spot in the Sunday 
League in his hometown. From 
there, he might even be able 
to graduate to the Sunday and 
Wednesday league: “those guys 
are so good, I would love to be 
able to get their autographs.”
On another side of the 
conference tournament weeks, 
which conclude on March 17, 
is the ACC championship game. 
And as it turns out, Duke and the 
University of North Carolina are 
already in the finals! Pitt lost in 
the first round to Virginia. None 
of these things have actually 
happened, but I have a stunning 
foresight called common sense. 
I also have a time machine. 
But like the plot of Back to the 
Future II, the protagonist will 
not allow me to profit from my 
future knowledge. Instead, I’m 
resigned to writing ice-cold 
sports takes that aren’t even 
slightly funny for a college 
newspaper at a college that 
would find themselves six feet 
under before touching anything 
sports-related with a ten-foot 
pole. It’s a rough life.
On some things related to 
the NCAA, I’ve been sworn to 
secrecy by the organization, 
but I can tell you one thing: the 
dark horse candidate for the 
conference tournaments this 
year is Tennessee Tech. They 
are 4-14 in the Ohio Valley 
Conference, and Belmont is, like, 
actually good. But Tennessee 
Tech is going to run the gauntlet 
and win their tournament; it’s 
a verified fact, from the future. 
I’m unable to tell you if tomor-
row ever comes, though, as it is 
unsubstantiated malarkey.

On Thursday, the baseball 
world ?nally let out a sigh of 
relief. With MLB spring training 
already underway, Bryce Harper 
?nally, ?nally got off the market 
and signed a 13-year, $330 million 
contract with the Philadelphia 
Phillies, setting the record for 
the largest contract in baseball 
history, and the second largest in 
the history of sports.
Though Harper isn’t the Tom 
Brady or Lebron James of the 
MLB (Mike Trout wears the crown 
as the best player in baseball), 
he matches them with name 
recognition as one of the biggest 
stars in the sport. The reaction 
to the contract re?ects that: the 
Phillies sold 100,000 tickets less 
than 24 hours after the news broke 
and the Phillies’ World Series odds 
jumped from 14 to 1 up to 10 to 1.
Though the contract’s numbers 
are eye-popping, both Harper and 
the Phillies got what they want. 
The contract comes with no opt-
outs for Harper — something he 
demanded — as well as more than 
10 seasons. In Philadelphia, Harper 
wants to win championships, of 
course, but there is also something 
he craved that he got: stability, 
a team to play for the rest of his 
career.
The Phillies are based in one 
of the biggest markets in the 
country, but they have maintained 
a relatively low payroll the last 
few years compared to the huge 
payrolls of teams like the New 
York Yankees and the Los Angeles 
Dodgers. They can more than 
afford Harper, and he gives them 
what they want: star power and 
a better roster with a chance to 
contend for the World Series. He’s 
a streaky player, with the highest 
of highs like his unanimous MVP 
season in 2015 and the lows of bad 
hitting and abysmal defense of last 
season. But he’s young, only 26 
years old, and undoubtedly makes 
the Phillies a better team.
The other big free agent of the 
year was star shortstop Manny 
Machado, who signed with the San 
Diego Padres on Feb. 20 with a 10-
year $300 million contract (which 
was the biggest free agent contract 
in history before Harper’s). 
Machado, after spending the ?rst 
six-and-a-half years of his career 
in Baltimore, was traded to the 
Dodgers last season for the team’s 
(failed) World Series push. As a 
shortstop, he has more value as 
a position player on defense than 
Harper, an out?elder, and is nearly 
as young. He hasn’t won an MVP 
and doesn’t have as much star 
power, but he makes the Padres, 
a team that lost 96 games last 
season, instantly better.
Much of the glacial pace of this 
off-season’s free agency market 
has been discussed and dissected. 
Teams have been scared off by 
previous blockbuster contracts 
that weren’t worth it, like Albert 
Pujols’ contract with the Los 
Angeles Angels. Other teams, 
like the New York Mets, have 
historically frugal ownership who 
don’t seem to want to commit to 
spending in order to win. Both 
Harper’s and Machado’s contracts 
contradict these reasons, but they 
are the rare exception, not the 
rule. They are young superstars 
who have high enough ceilings 
that the possible ?oors are worth 
the risk.
Other players don’t get 
contracts for double-digit years, 
or $300 million. Reliever Craig 
Kimbrel, coming off a World Series 
win with the Boston Red Sox, is still 
a free agent, as is Dallas Keuchel, a 
recent Cy Young winner and for-
mer Houston Astros ace (before 
they got Justin Verlander and Ger-
rit Cole). Pitcher Gio Gonzalez 
and out?elder Adam Jones are still 
on the market, but at 33, they are 
near to their careers’ ends.

As the 91st Academy Awards revealed its winners, Roma, a black and white 
artistic film based in Mexico City in 1970, won Best Foreign Language Film, Best 
Director, and Best Cinematography. To me, Roma’s success was well deserved.
The beginning scene of Roma immediately set the pace of the film. It was a long 
close-up shot of a stone-paved driveway with soapy water gradually coming into 
our vision to rinse the driveway. Then we saw the protagonist of the film, Cleo, 
standing at the end of driveway, performing her daily cleaning task. After that, 
we followed her through the daily housekeeping routine via mainly still camera 
positions, as if we were invisible observers standing in the house. Cleo was also 
not visible all the time; she walked in and out of the frame, casually living her 
life. This technique created suspense for the audience. I found myself imagining 
what she was doing outside the frame and agitatedly anticipated her to come 
back on screen. This style of cinematography allowed the audiences to come 
closer to the Cleo and quickly connect with her.
Another particularly skillful and artistic scene happened after Cleo broke the news 
of her pregnancy to her boyfriend in a movie theater. The camera was positioned a 
few rows behind their seats, so as the audiences witnessed the unfolding of their story, 
we felt as if we were in the cinema with Cleo. Upon hearing her pregnancy, Cleo’s boy-
friend excused himself to go the bathroom although their movie was ending soon. So, we 
waited with Cleo. As Cleo waits, she keeps on gazing back to the direction of the camera. 
In the half-lit setting, her eyes of anticipation and inquiry almost seemed to be directly look-
ing at us, seeking for an answer. I felt a strong urge of wanting to crawl through the screen 
and through the few rows that separated us to hug her. Only when I was reading the reviews 
afterward did I realized that this single-shot and almost silent scene lasted for several minutes. But 
in the theater, I felt those minutes fly by, and it was packed with emotion. In those few minutes, each 
one of the audience members got a chance to reflect on their own stories and project them onto the movie. 
Alfonso Cuarón’s extraordinary cinematography and use of silence allowed a truly interactive experience that fully immersed us into 
Cleo’s life.
Besides these breathtaking scenes that provoked everyone’s deepest emotional responses, Roma also accurately captured the relationship 
dynamic between Cleo and the family she served with all its intricacy, intimacy, balance, and imbalance. When Cleo’s water broke, the 
grandmother of the family pushed the limit of her old, deteriorated body to get Cleo to the nearest hospital. But she also cried with shiver-
ing guilt when she couldn’t answer even the most basic information of Cleo and could only manage to state their formal relationship, say-
ing “I’m her employer.” When Mr. Gutierrez abandoned the family, Cleo and Mrs. Gutierrez held each other up through difficulties and 
safeguarded the kids from the harsh reality of the world. The complex relationship between these two women, made me almost certain 
that Roma’s screenwriter had to be a woman. But I realized that this was masterful writing by Cuarón.
Cuarón noted that this was his most personal film, telling the public that “ninety percent of the scenes that you see in the film come out of 
my memory.” Later when asked if the real-life Cleo had seen the film, he said, “Yes, [she did]. She just cried. She kept on saying, ‘It was 
like this. It was like this.’” In Cuarón’s Oscars speech, he advised and reminded fellow artists around the world: “As artists our job is to 
look where others don’t. This responsibility becomes much more important in times when we are being encouraged to look away.” Even 
without knowing all the remarkable details of Roma, I believe Cuarón’s reminder was already a sufficient reason for anyone to watch his 
masterpiece.

A few ways of describing 
Cabaret:
The word “blindsided.”
A bubble bursting.
The sound of the police 
knocking on the door of 
a party.
Perhaps that last one is 
too literal, but I think 
you get the point. The 
play follows an American 
writer (Cliff, although 
his name may as well 
be Chad or Brett) as 
he moves to Berlin in 1939 to write his big 
novel. He goes to a cabaret (an edgy night 
performance, picture burlesque, and drag 
shows) and falls in love with the British 
performer Sally, and the two spend a few 
months living together as Nazism grows from 
a fringe extremist group to the ruling political 
ideology in Germany. 
Their story intertwines with that of Ernst, 
a Nazi who befriends Cliff and gives him 
employment running mysterious errands to 
Paris, and Frau Schneider, who owns the 
boarding house where Cliff and Sally live and 
gets engaged to Herr Schultz, a Jewish fruit 
grocer. You can probably guess how that all 
ends up.
At first, it seems like a love story. The first 
act is full of upbeat cabaret performances 
and budding romance. The choreography 
of numbers like “Two Ladies,” “Don’t Tell 
Mama,” and “Money” feature innuendo, filthy 
jokes, and comically exaggerated mimed 
sex acts which made me feel bad for any 
parents of young children watching the show. 
Outrageous fun. Cliff’s fast-moving romance 
with Sally is contrasted with the quiet, 
wholesome relationship between Schneider 
and Schultz, and until the end of Act I you 
almost believe there’s hope for any of the 
characters’ relationships.
Though it feels odd to say so, Cabaret was 
fun to watch. The stage transformed itself 
with every scene switch so that the cabaret 
and life outside it, where things are hitting 
the metaphorical fan, truly seem like two 
different worlds. The lighting shifted from 
more traditional orange-yellow to purplish, 
the costumes went from beige-brown suits 
and shawls to something akin to burlesque: 
high heels, red stockings, gaudy makeup and 
lots of skin. Even the German accents seemed 
happier (Willkommen!) and less serious 
during the cabaret numbers. I’m sure there 
were other, subtler changes I didn’t pick up 
on, but the message is as clear as the emcee 
tells us in the opening number: “In here, life 
is beautiful!”
The distinction between “in here” and “out 
there” is what ultimately leads to Cliff and 
Sally’s separation in the end. Cliff sees what’s 
going on outside of his escapist sabbatical 
(he doesn’t even start writing the book until 
he’s traveling home to Pennsylvania) and 
finds something wrong with it. Sally, like the 
emcee, says exactly how she sees things: 
“life’s a cabaret.” She loathes talking about 
politics and strives to avoid it at all costs.
This bubble is popped at the end of Act I, 
when all of the subplots converge at Frau 
Schneider and Herr Schultz’s engagement 
party. This is my favorite scene in the play; it’s 
akin to the moment a volleyball player drills 
a perfectly-set spike. Tension is built subtly 
throughout the act while everything is still 
fun and happy, then explodes when another 
tenant, Frau Kost, tells Ernst that Schultz is 
Jewish. There was an awkward pause at 
the end of this scene, where the audience 
really wasn’t sure if clapping was the right 
response. Do you clap for a group of Nazis 
singing nationalist folk songs to keep the 
mood “light” at a party? This is the kind of 
way Cabaret makes you feel.
It’s not hard to imagine why they chose this 
play given the political climate in the U.S., 
is it? Purnell has always played relevant 
mainstage shows (Ragtime, Detroit ‘67), but 
Cabaret feels more like 
a call to action than 
previous productions. 
Without being heavy-
handed, the musical 
makes a strong case 
against complacency. If 
conflict is a spectrum, 
with words at one end 
and war at the other, 
Cabaret falls closer to 
the former than the 
fall’s mainstage Detroit 
‘67, which takes place 
during the 1967 Detroit 
riots against racism and 
police brutality.

In this way, Cabaret unscrambles the 
questions that a wealthier audience 
(like us!) is likely to grapple with in 
conflict: is it okay to be close with someone 
with a dangerous political ideology? Should 
we really avoid talking about politics, religion, 
and sex with those we are close to? The 
play seems to answer no to these kinds of 
questions. Cliff ends up punching Ernst in the 
face (satisfying until he gets his ass kicked by 
three Nazi brownshirts) and leaving for the 
states without Sally.
Of course, the “politics” over which 
Cliff decides to leave Germany 
end up being much more to his 
German friends. Frau Schneider 
points out in Act II that transients 
like Cliff and Sally always have 
the option of just leaving, 
while Herr Schultz, and 
the cabaret performers, 
aren’t so lucky: they have 
nowhere to run. Cabaret 
gives a nod not only to 
Jewish persecution in 
Nazi Germany but also 
nonwhite and non-straight 
persecution, as the show is 
infiltrated by Nazis towards 
the end. As for Schneider 
and Schultz, who are older 
and think Nazism will pass, 
they seem to fall under the 
description of dramaturg 
Agatha Woodbury’s address 
in the playbook: “they 
witnessed all of the warning 
signs and just didn’t act […] 
because they were too distracted 
or because it benefited them.” 
Upon leaving the play, I found myself 
wondering what our equivalent is; what 
the warning signs we’re missing are. Is 
it spending weekends at clubs in the Strip 
District, dancing next to people who might be 
white supremacists? Is it focusing on careers 
or love interests or passions while missing the 
articles popping up on our newsfeeds? What 
is our bubble and when will it burst?
Talk about politics. Argue about politics. 
Especially with the people closest to you.

As someone who has idolized slam poet and rapper George 
Watsky for years, I immediately knew that I had to see him when he 
announced his Complaint tour at the start of the new year. This past 
Monday, I got to see him at Mr. Smalls Theater with a couple of 
friends. I knew that Watsky would be killer, but nothing could have 
prepared me for the experience that lay ahead.
Right before Watsky released his album, he tweeted a photo that 
showed a handwritten note. “Something I’ve been thinking about a 
lot is the importance of pain. Without pain, joy has no context.” The 
album’s theme of having “both joy and darkness” definitely shone 
through both Watsky’s performance and his openers’.
The concert opened with duo Feed the Biirds, consisting of Camila 
Recchio and Kush Mody. Mody has been a long-time collaborator 
with Watsky, and helped Watsky write a good number of songs like 
“Brave New World” and “Don’t Be Nice,” both of which were per-
formed that night. Recchio has also collaborated with Watsky in “Tiny 
Glowing Screens Part 3,” which Mody also wrote with Watsky.
Before this performance, I had never heard of Feed the Biirds, but 
now I can say that I’m hooked. Recchio’s voice is hypnotic, and 
Mody’s ability to hop from instrument to instrument is unreal. Later 
that night when I got home, I added the tracks that the duo per-
formed on Spotify, but something about Recchio’s vocals almost felt 
lacking in the studio version. The live performance had so much ener-
gy and felt freer than the studio version, which felt as if Recchio was 
holding herself back from being as expressive. That’s not to say that 
they sound bad in recordings, but if you get the chance to see Free 
the Biirds, I would definitely recommend seeing them.
Rapper Benjamin Laub, more popularly known as Grieves, performed 
after and really got the audience hyped up for Watsky. I only knew 
him from Watsky’s track “Exquisite Corpse,” which features six guest 
rappers. He performed a handful of his songs. His style definitely has 
a different flavor than Watsky’s, but I can’t exactly lay my finger on 
how. Saying that Grieves feels more effortless whereas Watsky’s is 
more existential feels too simplistic, but that’s the best way I can dif-
ferentiate them. Regardless, Grieves was absolutely phenomenal.
Right when the audience was worked up, Watsky appeared with Free 
the Biirds. He kicked off the show with “Brave New World.” Although 
the tour was named after Watsky’s recent album release, a good por-
tion of the songs he performed were from previous releases. Classics 
like “Sloppy Seconds” and “Hey Asshole” that introduced many fans 
to his music were played. Throughout the concert, the energy was 
absolutely unreal. It’s cliché and said about virtually any concert that 
anybody goes to, but I honestly felt connected with the audience and 
performers. Songs like “Welcome to the Family” and “Limo 4 Emos,” 
both from his most recent release, was a nod to Watsky’s message of 
love and acceptance.
Right after performing “Tiny Glowing Screens Part 3,” the stage 
appeared to clear off. However, the crowd chanted “Watsky!” 
repeatedly until he came back with a broom. He said he wasn’t sure 
why he decided to, but he was going to go with it anyways. He and 
the band performed two more songs, closing off with one of my 
favorites, “Whoa Whoa Whoa.” This was the track that ultimately 
turned me into a fan back in freshman year of college; hearing it live 
felt like I was listening to it for the first time all over again.
After the show, Grieves was near the merchandise stand. Despite my 
usually rotten luck in life, I managed to snag a selfie and an auto-
graph before a line could even form. While my friend and I were 
waiting for our Uber driver, we heard someone saying that Watsky 
was chatting with fans. We had at least a good 15 minutes until our 
ride arrived, so we decided to at least try to take a picture before 
leaving. It still feels surreal that I got to chat with someone I looked 
up to and personally thank for inspiring me through his art.
In the first opening act, Recchio said something along the lines of “art 
is where you can show your passion for life.” She said that art can 
take any form, and music was her form. Watsky’s ability to elegantly 
capture both the pain and beauty in the world is his art, and it defi-
nitely resonated with me. There were hard days where I blared his 
music and felt less lonely, almost as if I was having a friend who just 
understood me, without me having to say anything. His candidness 
with his struggles and experiences that he shares through his music 
definitely encouraged me to straighten my back and seize every 
day, and I’m confident that I’m not the only one who feels that way. 
Although I’m not sure if I have quite found my “art” in that sense,

Carnegie Mellon alumnus and Hollywood 
producer and writer Javier Grillo-Marxuach 
will visit campus on March 6 to present a 
scholarship award to an undergraduate in 
Creative Writing and give a talk on his craft. 
The award is endowed by contributions from 
the Grillo-Marxuach family. Altogether, the 
family is responsible for the endowment of 
more than 20 scholarships across a variety 
of fields, from science research to peace and 
justice studies.
But writing has a special place in Grillo-
Marxuach’s heart. He wrote to The Tartan, 
“When my parents set up the fund that makes 
all of this possible, they encouraged me to take 
an active role in the family’s philanthropy, and 
my mind immediately went to screenwriting 
and creative writing.”
Grillo-Marxuach graduated from Carnegie 
Mellon in 1991, and he went on to graduate 
from the School of Cinematic Arts at University 
of Southern California (USC) with an MFA in 
Screenwriting. After that, he became a junior 
executive at NBC, which helped to jump-start 
a career in TV writing that landed him as a 
member of the writing team on Lost. Since 
then, he’s worked as a producer or writer on 
TV shows like The Middleman, Medium, and 
The 100. He’s also written a series of comics 
and two collections of non-fiction. It requires a 
certain amount of capital to thrive like Grillo-
Marxuach has, especially in Hollywood, and 
he recognizes that “supporting new voices is 
crucial” to the development of young writers. 
“Our field is highly speculative and requires 
a great deal of exploration, you don’t just 
transition smoothly from your student life 
into a high-paying job as a novelist upon 
graduation,” he wrote.
Before endowing the current award at 
Carnegie Mellon, the Grillo-Marxuach family 
fund endowed an award at USC for Masters 
screenwriters interested in Hispanic language 
and culture, so the awards are designed to 
follow Grillo-Marxuach’s educational career. As 
a student at Carnegie Mellon, Grillo-Marxuach 
was a member of Scotch’n’Soda and The 
Tartan, where he wrote two columns every 
week for a while: “I was generally tied to a 
keyboard most of the time.”
And Carnegie Mellon gave Grillo-Marxuach 
the space to experiment, and fail, in his 
growth as a writer. The time spent typing and 
practicing his craft at college paid off for Grillo-
Marxauch, and he says that “it was the totality 
of my experience that made it clear to me that 
supporting others who have chosen the crazy 
life of a writer is a good idea.”
As with anybody who comes to Carnegie 
Mellon, the city plays an important part 
in leaving a mark on the experience. The 
Carnegie Museums and the Warhol museum 
were some of Grillo-Marxuach’s favorite places 
in Pittsburgh. He says they are “a source of 
endless inspiration for me.” And one year 
during college he tried vegetarianism, but he 
decided he had had enough and walked from 
Craig St. to The Original Hot Dog Shop, where 
he consumed a half-pound burger with bacon 
and an egg on top.
But Grillo-Marxuach is more than just a 
Carnegie Mellon alumnus who has gone on 
to a successful career; he’s choosing to endow 
a scholarship for a greater purpose than just 
the value of a single student’s education. The 
scholarship is one small way of giving back to 
the community that is responsible for a part 
of his education that helped him on his way 
through the world. More importantly, it’s part 
of a lifelong commitment to a larger system of 
making education more accessible for people 
that struggle financially.
Through his podcast, “Children of Tendu,” 
Grillo-Marxuach and co-host Jose Molina 
have given away their intimate knowledge of 
the back rooms of Hollywood for free and for 
everyone. They’ve covered everything from 
production to agents to actors, and last year, 
they pitched a TV show on the podcast. The 
description of the two-part episode reads, 
“Most TV writers do not hear a series being 
pitched until they are the ones doing the 
pitching.”
Grillo-Marxuach will be visiting campus 
on Wednesday, March 6 to give a talk on 
screenwriting to share a little more knowledge 
with our campus. The talk will be in the Gladys 
Schmitt Creative Writing Center, or Baker Hall 
260, at 4:30 p.m. Food will be provided.

Shiny patent leather, soft sheer 
white fabric, and structural 
breakdowns of traditional 
silhouettes were all the rage at 
this year’s Lunar Gala. Contrast 
and tension in the designs brought 
forth an exploration of shapes 
and textures, as the harsh runway 
lights reflected off of metallic pants 
and glittering panels of fabric. 
This tension was borne out of an 
examination of this year’s theme: 
Anomie. 
Fashion’s industrial side was 
notable throughout the show, and 
there was a decidedly structural 
and monochromatic feel to each 
collection. Fierce reds, muted blues, 
and tennis-ball yellows popped 
against clean blacks and stark 
whites, but the focus was more on 
unique constructions of silhouettes 
and contrasts of materials. This 
year’s Lunar Gala featured 20 
collections, including a line that 
showcased alumni designs, and 
another that featured a local 
Pittsburgh designer. With over 120 
people involved, the show was a 
testament to the stunning creativity 
and truly admirable work ethic of 
Carnegie Mellon’s student body.
The show opened with a stunning 
dance routine, performed by 
members of Carnegie Mellon’s 
own Soulstylz, LG Dance, and Infra 
Dance. There were three total 
performances throughout Lunar 
Gala, each decidedly lyrical, but 
with the high energy and edginess 
of a hip hop routine. Dramatic and 
sharp, the performers themselves 
embodied the “incongruence of 
realities,” breaking their bodies 
into angular shapes to transition

into smoother, more ballet-based 
movements.
The first collection, Lucid, designed 
by Chaeyun Lee, Nicole Lee-Park, 
and Somin Shim, emphasized 
the contrast between the opaque 
and the translucent. Much of the 
collection utilized paneling of the 
different fabrics to subtly conceal 
the model’s bodies and reveal new 
silhouettes. The laser-sharp focus 
on composition encouraged the 
viewer to pay closer attention to the 
shapes and textures of the fabric. 
One of my favorite collections, Lucid 
was an incredibly strong opener 
that jumped enthusiastically into the 
show’s theme.
Lautus, designed by Yoon Young 
Kim, featured an absolutely stunning 
dress made out of belt buckles 
and white chiffon-like material. 
This collection embraced the softer 
looks of dresses and flowing fabrics 
with the utility of thick belts and 
straps, creating a combination of 
clothing that deconstructs traditional 
styles. The tighter white bodies 
of the clothes were broken up by 
dark panels of glittery blue fabric, 
adding another interestingly angular 
component to the playful line.
Nautico was a journey into the sea, 
combining the traditional styles of 
nautical clothing with the shapes 
of the sea itself. Designed by David 
Perry, the line featured impressive 
ropework and knit detailing that 
resulted in an incredibly cohesive 
design. One of the most memorable 
pieces of Nautico was a playful and 
more abstract take on the diving 
suit, as pale red stripes circled a 
model’s head to resemble a helmet.

---------------------------------------------------

Tennis never looked so good with 
Charlotte Deiss’s Grip. Dramatic 
and powerful, the line 
combined tennis-related 
materials (like mesh, 
a net, and the blocked 
outlines of the court itself) 
with feminine power 
wear. Muted blues and 
neon yellows popped 
against the dark blacks of 
sporty skirts and low-cut 
power-suits, bringing the 
intense energy and confidence of a 
tennis player onto the runway.
Straps of denim fabric swayed 
beautifully around models’ legs 
in Xiaoying Meng’s Re:born. 
Featuring discarded fabrics from 
local designers, the collection is a 
comment on the excessive waste 
generated by the fashion industry. 
Weaving together bits and pieces 
from different fabrics and pieces 
of clothing with raw hems, models 
wore asymmetric outfits that 
highlighted the individuality of each 
piece.
Lily Cunicelli and Laura Riviere 
teamed up to design Fete. The line 
was sophisticated and elegant, with 
beautiful flowing sheer dresses 
and tiny pearl detailing on long 
sleeves. Fete heavily utilized silk, 
chiffon, and ruffles to construct a 
dinner-party of 8 different styles, 
from a more ready-to-wear party 
dress decorated with copper wiring 
to a more structured black square 
top. While the many styles resulted 
in an only mildly cohesive line, 
they were meant to celebrate and 
bring to light the contributions of 
eight groundbreaking women in art 
history. An interesting concept and 
impressive execution – I only wished 
I knew who those eight women 
were.
Eden was an especially impressive 
line, examining the degradation of 
the earth through the use of paper-
like textiles and dyes. Use of color 
was an especially strong point in 
this collection, especially when it 
came to expression of theme: the 
coral-like dresses ombréd from 
muted reds and blues to a white, 
signaling the loss of life in the 
ocean’s coral reefs; their powerful 
feathered coat blended from an 
immaculate white to shiny black, 
indicative of oil spills. Designed by 
Vincent DeRienzo, Leah Kendrick, 
and Tyng Peck, Eden was raw, 
refreshingly experimental, and 
really strong in its execution.
Synergy:Coexist heavily featured 
great swaths of fabric draped 
over more skeletal frames made 
of a flexible wood-like material. 
Described as an exploration of “the 
rigidity and flexibility of organic 
relationships and human nature,” 
the collection meshed intricate 
string work with fixed frames and 
structures to create a style that I can 
only describe as “Abstract Roman.” 
Synergy:Coexist was designed by 
Min Young Jeong and Christine 
Kim.
Found was another one of my 
favorite collections. Utilizing found 
materials around campus – like 
garbage bags, Red Bull cans, and 
newspaper – Found discovered 
ways to reuse old materials “to 
redefine and expand the definitions 
of object value and beauty past 
their traditional means.” Designed 
by Ashley Burbano and Jessa 
Westheimer, the collection was 
innovative in drawing attention 
to our community’s own habits in 
connection to sustainability.
Opaque dives into the experiences 
of life with mental illness, seeking 
to encourage a conversation that 
connects the experience of shielding 
one’s emotions with the use of 
clothing as protection from the 
outside world. Handling a balance 
between protection from one’s 
own thoughts and protection from 
the harsh elements of the world, 
the collection heavily featured 
utility pieces like belts and straps 
alongside softer panels of fabric. 
The collection was designed by 
Alice Fang, Sophia Kim, and Jaclyn 
Saik.
Designed by Mariana Alberola 
Rezza, Zain Islam-Hashmi, and 
Stephanie Smid, Alluminare was a 
showstopping end to Part One of 
Lunar Gala. Glow-in-the-dark resin 
was integrated into each piece, 
creating intricate geometric patterns 
on coats and halos of orange 
glowing around a model’s head. 
The true strength in the duality 
of this collection was the clothing 
itself – even without the fun glow-
in-the-dark component, each piece 
was dynamic and strong enough to 
stand on their own.
“You’ve never seen the Kardashians 
quite like this.” Combining the 
Fashion Nova-like energy of 
Kardashian fashion with the ironic 
twist of popular memes (“Kim, 
there’s people that are dying!” 
was embroidered on the back of 
a jacket), Broqué was a playful

collection in both its style and 
humor. It was one of the few 
collections that showcased bright 
and colorful pieces, with blue silk 
outfits with Obama’s portrait, wire 
crowns, and long yellow coats. 
Designed by Katie Boyle and Arden 
Wolf, Broqué was a fun comment 
on internet celebrity fashion trends.
Beaux was designed by Daniela 
Delgado and Rishi Karthikeyan, 
featuring a heavy focus on 
femininity and corsets. The 
collection aimed to subvert the 
“traditional function of corsets by 
allowing them to conform and 
accentuate the natural body rather 
than retrain it.” With dresses that 
were half-corset frame and half-full-
length dress, the collection put forth 
an interesting concept surrounding 
the strength and power in female 
clothing.
Shibui was an expert use of 
different textiles and silhouettes, 
combining thicker knit fabric 
with dynamic shifting reds. The 
clothing was made up of simple, 
yet beautiful shapes, presenting a 
clean look with fine detailing that 
introduced complexity into the 
simplicity of the looks. Ellen Zhu’s 
designs were a fantastic exploration 
into a contrast between different 
texture detailing in clothing.
Phantasus, designed by Clara 
Zhao, combined structural form-
making and contrasting materials 
to create intricate designs. The 
sculpture-like draping of tulle was 
beautiful and regal, emphasizing 
the movement and shape of the 
body. It was dream-like and poetic, 
and the collection’s construction was 
stunning.
Next was a line that featured a 
unique set of pieces designed and 
constructed by past Lunar Gala 
alumni. With ready-to-wear pieces 
like royal blue blazers to more 
bold rainbow skirts, the Alumni 
Line was a nice celebration of the 
earlier years of Lunar Gala that 
encouraged current students to 
“explore all the opportunities in the 
world with passion.”
Dedicated to reforming the 
traditional feminine power-suit, 
Unpoetic Beauty expertly utilized 
dynamic color blocking and 
peplum-like silhouettes. Designer 
Christianna Murray took inspiration 
from Japanese Samurai armor and 
Victorian-era clothing to create a 
blend of power, confidence, and 
authority. One particularly cool 
moment from this collection was the 
pairing of two models with similar 
color schemes and garments. 
Decked out in muted royal blue and 
purple, the pair looked stunning as 
they walked down the runway.
Lachesism was another one of my 
favorite lines. Bold in its use of 
color and its attitude, the street-
fashion collection truly showcased 
the personality of the designer and 
the models. Designer Rebecca Kim 
“encompassed the desire to shed 
all constancy,” with neon yellow 
cropped puffer jackets and sporty 
mesh-like two pieces, breaking 
against the traditional shapes of 
such clothing. Meant to also explore 
disaster, the accompanying sound 
design was disruptive and eclectic 
– which, in all honesty took me out 
of the experience, but I appreciated 
the integration of the rest of the 
production environment with the 
clothing.
SLOG was another collection 
that cleverly incorporated sound 
design into its experience, weaving 
in alarms and industrial alerts to 
reflect the worker-inspired pieces 
on the runway. “SLOG poses the 
worker as a figure of beauty,” 
and beautiful it was! The futuristic 
dissections of industrial work attire 
were inspired, finding beauty in 
the functional. It was an effective 
collection, and one of the most 
cohesive of the night. Designed 
by Mimi Jiao and Nina Yoo, SLOG 
was a captivating and professional 
runway experience.
Yang Gao, D.K. Wang, and 
Veronica Wang’s line Urban 
Nomads closed Lunar Gala. Taking 
harsh industrial materials like 
denim, wood, and plastic to reflect 
ancient tribe-like nomadic clothing, 
the collection was a rich exploration 
of transformation through one’s 
surroundings. Powerful shapes 
created out of a symmetry of 
looping circles of wood and straps 
of fabric, creating a strong line that 
was simultaneously modern and 
explorative.
The organizers explained their 
theme by saying, “ANOMIE 
embraces an uncertain future on 
the horizon and the resilience of 
communities who are defining it.” 
And embrace it, it does. This year’s 
show was a true celebration of the 
student body, and everyone who 
contributed to it should be insanely 
proud.

A+ meme. For the most part, this nicely 
summarizes the stereotypes of different 
colleges’ cultures. Had to knock off half a 
point because there’s no way that Tepper 
would say “yeah sure” if you asked them 
if you could copy their homework or even 
if you asked them if they could give you a 
hint on how to do the homework. I would 
probably switch it with CIT, which is “bold of 
you to assume I did the homework.”

Another strong meme that’s too accurate. As 
much as I love Pittsburgh and the Carnegie 
Mellon community that I now call home, 
the weather here is absolutely abysmal. I 
know many people will call the weather of 
wherever they live the most fickle weather 
possible, but I really do think that Pittsburgh 
deserves to be recognized for its incredible 
ability to cram all four seasons in the span of 
24 hours.

The “is this a pigeon” meme is a bit of an 
older format that’s losing steam so a point 
is docked there. The meme also uses the 
font Impact, which is one of the banes of 
my existence, so another point is lost. With 
all that said and done, the added Airpod 
is a nice detail, and this meme points out 
an extremely important phenomenon. Like 
many other students, I have a pair of eyes 
that has fallen victim to the “witnessing boys 
in shorts in freezing weather” epidemic that 
has swept the nation even at the cost of 
potential familial disappointment. Please, if 
you brave the freezing cold with shorts, take 
your Airpod funds and invest in a pair of 
seasonally-appropriate pants. Your legs will 
thank you.

Chintareddy is the online editor of The Tartan. This affiliation has no bearing on 
the meme rating.
As the previously uncultured swine that I was, I did not understand why this 
meme was the fourth liked meme that was posted in February 2019. However, 
after doing some casual research and realizing that this meme was in honor 
of a man Chintareddy calls “her boyfriend every time [sic] someone asks me if 
I’m single... and they end up thinking he’s a real guy until I tell them he lives 
outside Baker Hall,” I came to understand why this meme racked up so many 
likes. Godspeed, first Ph.D. graduate of Carnegie Mellon.

This is a simple meme; it isn’t 
really a meme, hence the 
lower rating. It’s more of a 
picture of a moving truck that 
says “Airpods” outside of the 
Tepper Quad with the caption 
“Looks like David Tepper has a 
big surprise for us.” As much 
as I’d love to imagine that 
the 2.9 percent tuition hike 
would be spent so that I could 
flex on non-Carnegie Mellon 
students with my prestigious

that instead, it will be going

O
f all the things I expected to 
happen in 2019, the Jonas 
Brothers reuniting was never one 
of them. But we tweens and teens of the 
late aughts can rejoice: after nearly six 
years, the best brother band is back, and 
the balance of the universe has been 
restored.
While the signs were there, the 
announcement and new single came as 
a surprise. Last year, the band’s social 
media accounts were reactivated, but 
nothing came of it until Feb. 28, when 
the accounts were blacked out and they 
announced that they were dropping a 
new single, “Sucker,” due at midnight on 
March 1.
Cue the screams, the memes, the cries 
of joy. Personally, I was excited, but my 
action didn’t really come until I saw the 
music video. If I’m being completely 
honest, I wasn’t a huge Jonas Brothers 
fan. I never saw them in concert, I didn’t 
own any of the “Future Mrs. Jonas” 
t-shirts, and I didn’t even buy any of the 
CDs.
But if you grew up during that time, you 
understand. The Jonas Brothers were 
everywhere. Everyone from ages five to 
15 watched Camp Rock. We remember 
Joe’s crazy hair, Nick’s wild curls, 
and Kevin’s … poor Kevin, the older, 
responsible one who didn’t sing as much 
and was in a long-term relationship. No 
matter. We remember the excessive vests 
and scarves and sunglasses. “Burning Up” 
and “Lovebug” on loop.
Since the band’s not-so-amicable breakup 
in 2013, Joe and Nick have seen solid 
solo success, while Kevin semi-retired 
from music and became an entrepreneur 
and a father. Joe’s band DNCE had the 
article and layout by Marika Yang | Publisher
art by Rebecca Enright | Art Editor
2015 earworm “Cake by the Ocean,” 
while Nick’s “Jealous” and “Chains” were 
all over pop radio and he ventured into 
acting roles. And both are probably just 
as famous for their celebrity relationships: 
Joe with fiancé Sophie Turner of Game of 
Thrones, and Nick with new wife Priyanka 
Chopra, a huge international Bollywood 
star.
But a reunion wouldn’t work unless the 
song (and subsequent music) was good. 
Their solo success makes the comeback 
feel more authentic (versus washed 
up, middle-aged former boy banders 
coming together to make some money), 
and legions of JoBros fans would eat up 
concert tickets, but without decent music, 
they wouldn’t survive. The music industry 
in 2019 is vastly different than it was in 
2009, at the height of their fame, or even 
2013, the last time they released music 
together. They’re no longer perfect Disney 
products, but that’s probably a good 
thing.
Fortunately, “Sucker” is good. Co-written 
and co-produced by pop mastermind 
Ryan Tedder, the song is light and breezy, 
and doesn’t take itself too seriously. 
Nick and Joe trade verses about being 
infatuated with someone, singing 
about being “a sucker for you.” It mixes 
elements of Nick’s solo pop career with 
DNCE’s fun, funky pop. With a breathy 
baseline, rhythmic claps, and jazzy 
whistles, the high falsetto of their 
voices gets to shine. I can see it 
dominating pop radio from the 
spring into summer.
“Sucker” is a catchy song, 
but what it really has going 
for it is an expertly planned 
and produced music video. 
Starring their significant 
The Jonas Brothers
are backThe Jonas Brothers 
are back
others, Turner, Chopra, and Kevin’s wife 
Danielle Jonas, the self-dubbed “J sisters,” 
the video is romantic and fun and makes 
a bold statement that the Jonas Brothers 
are all grown up. There will be no “Future 
Mrs. Jonas” shirts anymore. Taking place 
in Hatfield House, the castle featured 
in The Favourite and where Queen 
Elizabeth I grew up, the video has Alice 
in Wonderland vibes with bright colors, 
extravagant costumes, fancy tea parties, 
and bubble baths in the hedge garden. 
The video ends with the three couples 
posing for an old-masters style painting, 
driving the point home that this new era 
is all about family.
I’m excited for what comes next. The 
Jonas Brothers will release an album, go 
on tour, maybe do it again, or perhaps 
maintain their solo careers. It doesn’t 
matter. What matters is that sometimes 
childhood memories can come rushing 
back in a tornado of nostalgia, and that 
can’t help but put a smile on my face.

Another year, another Oscars. This 
time there wasn’t a host (thank god). 
The Academy almost cut out Best 
Cinematography and Best Editing from the 
broadcast but then they didn’t. They also 
nominated at least four movies for Best 
Picture that shouldn’t have been on there 
and there were wrong decisions made 
for awards (again), but we’ll get to that 
in a little bit. It was a bizarre ceremony 
this year. The Academy is clearly trying 
to move away from art films and trying to 
incorporate more crowd-pleasing films at 
the expense of integrity. So without further 
introduction, here is another recap of why 
the Oscars were a joke (again).
 Chapter 1: Most of the award choices
Bohemian Rhapsody got Best Editing? I 
mean, I suppose it’s a miracle the film 
even got made into something coherent 
after all the production drama behind the 
scenes. There should be a separate Oscars 
category for 
those films that 
manage to get 
made despite 
going through 
a production 
nightmare. But 
besides that, 
you’re gonna 
give a film that 
cuts 100 times 
in two minutes 
the award for 
Best Editing? 
To be fair, it’s not like the category was 
stacked in the first place, with Vice and 
Green Book both being very annoying 
films that didn’t have good editing. Did the 
Academy forget what good editing looks 
like? Is that why they wanted to move the 
category off screen to the commercials?
Besides editing, there weren’t any 
other technical awards that particularly 
written by Sujar Utkarsh| Pillbox Editor
art by Christa Hester | Staff Artist
layout by Marika Yang | Publisher
aggravated me. Black Panther won more 
awards than it should have, and there 
were better films in each category that 
deserved the award more, but I was fine 
that it won. I was indifferent to most of the 
actor and actress wins. Olivia Colman’s 
win was my favorite, and she gave one 
of my favorite speeches ever. Alfonso 
Cuarón, my idol, got three awards that 
night for Roma, including Best Director, 
and those were the best decisions of the 
night. BlacKkKlansman shouldn’t have 
won Best Adapted Screenplay, but Spike 
Lee finally getting an award was long 
overdue. There were many other films that 
deserved nominations that didn’t get any, 
but that’s not a surprise.
But the two worst wins of the night, and 
maybe two worst wins in the last ten 
years, go to Green Book’s wins for Best 
Screenplay and Best Picture.
Chapter 2: Green Book
This movie was bad. It was repetitive, 
boring, cliche, cookie cutter Oscar bait 
that did not deserve any of the praise it 
got. It wasn’t shot well. It wasn’t edited 
well. It was paced terribly. The acting was 
good, but that was all in the performance 
and not in the weak direction. It handled 
the subject matter with the subtlety of a 
train derailing. This was the worst film in 
the list of eight films nominated for Best 
Picture. To top it off, Don Shirley’s family 
said the film was inaccurate. Why does 
the Academy think they’ve solved racism 
with simplistic films like Green Book? Why 
do films like Green Book always portray 
racism as individual instances rather 
than a systemic issue that individuals 
perpetuate? It’s embarrassing that works 
of art like Roma that handle social and 
class issues much more subtly are swept 
aside in favor of the more obvious, 
vanilla, and plain films like Green Book. 
I shouldn’t be surprised by their choice, 
but given that there were better choices 
The Oscar Offenses
Award shows are pretty irrelevant and useless, and they don ‘t mean anything in the grand scheme of things. For the most part, it’s not a celebration of achievements in film.
in the Best Picture and Best Screenplay 
categories that were more favored, Green 
Book is a baffling choice and it will go 
down as one of the worst Best Picture 
winners.
Chapter 3: The honest truth about awards shows
Awards shows are pretty irrelevant and 
useless, and they don’t mean anything in 
the grand scheme of things. For the most 
part, it’s not a celebration of achievements 
in film. If it were, Green Book wouldn’t 
have won Best Picture or Best Screenplay, 
and many other films would be nominated 
for awards. Films that are truly great 
works of art, like Roma and The Favourite, 
will be remembered for that. They will be 
studied, referenced, and recommended for 
years and years to come. There are many 
timeless films that exist that never won an 
award, like The Shawshank Redemption. 
That just shows how much these awards 
don’t matter.
The only reason I watch the Oscars 
are because I’ve watched most of the 
films nominated, so I feel some sense of 
obligation to see what wins. Otherwise, 
there is no real reason to watch it. Maybe 
one day the Academy will come to their 
senses and get experts in each category 
to curate actual lists for the best of the 
best in each category. But that’s not going 
to happen anytime soon.
