The program for Carnegie Day has 
been revised so that all festivities have 
been omitted.
The exercises will be held in Car­
negie Music Hall at 3:30 P. M. The 
program will include music by the 
Carnegie Choral Club, instrumental 
music, an address on Andrew Car­
negie, and the conferring of the hon­
orary degree of Doctor of Engineer­
ing upon William McConway, Chair­
man of the Committee on the Insti­
tute of Technology of the Board of 
Trustees of the Carnegie Institute.
The degree is conferred in recogni­
tion of his great service to education, 
his scholarly attainments, and his un­
selfish and constant devotion to pub­
lic duty. This is the first time an 
honorary degree has been conferred 
by the Institute. The degree will be 
presented with the cap and gown, 
and hood lined with the Tartan.
All classes in the four schools, on 
Carnegie Day, will be scheduled up to 
3:00 P. M., at that hour the students 
of each of the several schools will 
be required to assemble in their re­
spective buildings, under marshals, 
which are to be appointed. The line 
of march will start at the M. M. C. S., 
the students of that school preceding, 
across the campus and over the bridge, 
the Design students joining the pro­
cession at their building, and the 
Science students third and the Indus­
tries fourth, this order of march being 
determined by the respective locations 
of the buildings in reference to the 
line of march.
The students in the line of march 
will not require tickets for admission 
to the Music Hall.
All students, Day and Night, can 
secure two tickets for the exercises, 
for their parents and friends, by call­
ing at the office of the Registrar.
M. M. C. S. students should call at 
the office of the Dean for their tickets.
Last Friday afternoon the students 
and faculty of the schools joined in 
the memorial services for Dean Hew­
lett, which were held in the main 
corridors of the new Design School. 
The solemn and impressive service 
was simultaneous with the funeral, 
which was held in Grace Church, 
in Brooklyn, the home of the Dean.
The beautiful entrance and cross 
corridor on the first floor of the De­
sign School was fittingly draped in 
mourning, and a platform1 was erect­
ed at the intersection of the two cor­
ridors, from which the eulogies were 
pronounced.
The students and faculty of the Ap­
plied Design School gathered in a 
separate room and marched in a body 
to the place of service. Rev. Travers,
D.D., Rector of the Trinity Episcopal 
Church, pronounced the invocation, 
after which a mixed quartet sang 
“Crossing The Bar.” Director Hamer- 
schlag then spoke, in a voice broken 
by emotion, of his friendship for Dean 
Hewlett, of the great loss he had suf­
fered in his death, of the difficulty 
which would be experienced in replac­
ing him. But, the Director continued, 
the Dean’s work was not done. He 
had made such a commencement of 
the work of the Design School that 
he would always be remembered by 
the students who had been associated 
with him, and by those who in later 
years should come to the Institute, 
and the future progress of art and mu­
sic in the Design School would make 
but a fitting tribute to him who had 
given his life in their service. Dr. 
Brashear addressed the assembly, 
speaking of the excellent merits of 
the late Dean, “one of Nature’s best 
noblemen,” as Dr. Brashear called 
him. During the course of "his speech 
he read a glowing tribute to the mem­
ory and service of Mr. Hewlett from 
the Art Society, and resolutions of 
sympathy from the Trustees and Fac­
ulty of the University of Pittsburgh. 
In behalf of the student body, L. P. 
Button spoke of their warm friend­
ship for the Dean. Mr. Burgoyne,

C. Russell Hewlett, aged 41, dean 
of the School of Applied Design, and 
a prominent figure in the art and 
musical circles of the country, died 
a week ago last Tuesday at the West 
Penn Hospital of double pneumonia. 
He contracted a cold less than a week 
previously, being at his post at the 
Institute on Wednesday. Taken to 
the hospital on Thursday, his ailment 
unexpectedly developed into pneu­
monia.
His death, the first demise of an
administrative officer since the found­
ing of the institute, cast a shadow of 
gloom over the big school. It was 
closed for several days, and the stu­
dents and faculty took steps to con­
vey to the family messages of sym­
pathy. The body was taken back to 
Brooklyn Wednesday evening, and the 
funeral services were held at the 
Grace Church in that city on Friday 
afternoon.
Prof. Hewlett was born in Brook-

The loss of Dean Hewlett is felt 
most keenly by all who are connected 
with the schools, either as students 
or members of the faculty. It sel­
dom happens that a member of a 
college faculty possesses so 'ntimate 
and warm a friendship from the stu­
dents under him, as did the late Dean. 
He was respected and admired by all 
who came in contact with him; he al­
ways had a warm place in the hearts 
of those who were favored with his 
acquaintance; and the genuine mourn­
ing of the students is but a small 
token of the great loss they have 
suffered. His quiet and devoted in­
terest to the welfare of all branches 
of the Design School; his enthusiastic 
devotion to the promotion of the arts; 
his charming, unassuming personality; 
his unfailing courtesy; all the attri­
butes of a sweet, richly-endowed na­
ture, made him a man whom it will 
be difficult to replace. But we re­
joice that his work will long live 
after him; his example of devotion 
and service is still before us; and all 
future successes of the Design School 
and its students will in no small meas­
ure be due to the memory of his un­
flagging zeal and sincere character.

Owing to the sad death of Dean 
Hewlett, all exercises to be held on 
Carnegie Day have been cancelled, 
with the exception of the conferring 
of the degree upon Mr. McConway. 
Classes will be held as usual until 3
o’clock on that day, at which time the 
students will assemble in a body and 
march to the Music Hall, where the 
degree will be conferred.
This is the first time an honorary 
degree has been conferred by the In­
stitute of Technology. The Director 
and Deans will wear their cap and 
gowns, and the hood lined with the 
genuine Tartan will be given.
Here is a splendid opportunity for 
the students of Carnegie to stand back 
of the administration and faculty, and 
by their presence at the Music Hall, 
to give their hearty support to this 
granting of a degree.
The ceremony will not be long, the 
students being detained no longer than 
if they were at their regular classes. 
We know that every true Carnegie 
man will be present. If he has an 
interest in this Institute, here is the 
time and place where he will show it—• 
because the degree comes from the 
whole body of Carnegie. Let us fill 
the Music Hall to overflowing, and 
by our presence add something to the 
honor that is to be given Mr. McCon­
way.

When, last week at the Science gen­
eral lecture, it was announced that 
Miller, Beeken and Douthett of the 
Science School, Ebeling of Design and 
Carney of the Industries, had been 
elected members of the Seannachie, 
many of the students heard of this 
society for the first time. For their 
benefit, a short description of the or­
ganization and its membership and 
aims would not be inappropriate at 
this time.
The Seannachie (pronounced Sen- 
na-he) was formed March 6, 1912, and 
is the only honorary society in the in­
stitution. The name is that of a Scot­
tish bard whose office it was to per­
petuate the traditions of his race and 
to arouse his clan with a battle-song 
before a conflict.
The membership consists of men, 
selected from the upper classes in 
each of the three men’s schools, who 
have shown leadership ability in the 
various recognized student activities 
or in the class organizations. The 
number of active members for each 
year is limited, and considerable care 
is taken in choosing the men. The 
elections are held from time to time 
during the school year, and the mem­
bership limit has never, in the past, 
been reached.
Following out the significance of 
the name, the object of the organiza­
tion is to take the initiative in all 
matters affecting school spirit and to 
promote and perpetuate the traditions 
of the Institute. The methods used 
are mainly those of suggestion, the 
society standing pledged not to inter­
fere with the prerogatives of any rec­
ognized organization unless the best 
interests of the school make inter­
ference advisable.
The society is not, in intention, a 
secret one, but most of its work is 
done quietly, with as little publicity 
as possible. In its short life, much 
has been accomplished, mostly in the 
way of helping the recognized activi­
ties and their leaders.
The older students realize the pow­
ers and abilities of the organization 
and have been of assistance to it in 
the past. Newer students can benefit, 
as well as help, by getting into touch 
with the members in any of their 
difficulties, personal or public. The 
promotion of co-operation is the great 
aim of the Seannachie.
The present active membership in­
cludes: A. D. Beeken, Jr., L. G. Car­
ney, E. L. Clair, W. J. Corbett, G. M. 
Douthett, Geo. Ebeling, T. A. Eng- 
strom, C. E. Gilson, F. H. Haaren, G. 
C. Hays, G. G. Kelcey, C. B. Kline, 
L. R. Madison, W. F. McCaughey, Jr., 
A. H. McGill, Wm. Miller, and A. E. 
Wood, Jr.
The officers are E. L. Clair, presi­
dent; G. G. Kelcey, vice president, and 
W. J. Corbett, secretary.

The Trustees and Faculty of the 
University of Pittsburgh have learned 
with genuine sorrow of the death of 
C. Russell Hewlett, Dean of the 
School of Applied Design of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology. The 
Trustees, through the Executive Com­
mittee and the Faculty, at a meeting 
of the Deans, expressed this feeling 
in the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Trustees and 
Faculty of the University of Pitts­
burgh extend to Director Hamer- 
schlag and the Faculty of the Car­
negie Institute of Technology very 
sincere sympathy in the sorrow which 
has come to them through the death 
of Dean C. Russell Hewlett, their as­
sociate and fellow worker. The high 
character, the mental qualities, and the 
very unusual attainments of Mr. Hew­
lett contributed not alone to the 
strength and service of the Institute 
of Technology, but also to the well­
being and the reputation of our entire 
community. The loss is indeed great, 
and it will be difficult to fill the place 
made vacant by Mr. Hewlett’s death. 
It is further
Resolved, That the Trustees and 
Faculty of the University, of Pitts­
burgh, through the Director of the 
Institute of Technology, extend to the 
family of Mr. Hewlett assurances of 
their sympathy in the great bereave­
ment which has come to them in the 
death of a beloved son and brother.
The Alumni Association of the 
School of Applied Science sent a let­
ter of sympathy to Mr. Hewlett’s 
mother. We regret that we are un­
able to print the same herewith.

Mr. Hewlett’s favorite poem, Brown­
ing’s “Pheidippides.” The services 
were concluded by the entire assem­
blage singing “Ten Thousand Times 
Ten Thousand.”
The general committee in charge of 
these services was composed of Pro­
fessors R. H. Holmes, H. Geoghegan, 
and H. McGoodwin, from the faculty 
of the School of Applied Design.
Prof. Geoghegan and Burgoyne 
constituted a committee in charge of 
music for the occasion. Mr. Bur­
goyne took charge of the musical 
numbers rendered and Prof. Geoghe­
gan of the practical arrangements in 
connection with it.
Profs. Holmes, Sotter and Boyd 
constituted a committee to take charge 
of the exercises. They appointed the 
necessary ushers and met the speak­
ers and musicians who took part in 
the exercises, assembled the students 
for the march, etc.
Profs. Ferrand and Sollom and a 
body of students constituted a com­
mittee for the decoration of the en­
trance, lobby, and corridor, and had 
the disposal of any seating arrange­
ments.
Prof. Holmes took charge of the 
arrangements made with the student 
delegates to Brooklyn.
The funeral services in Brooklyn 
were attended by Dean Leete, of the 
School of Applied Science, Dean Con- 
nelley of the School of Applied In­
dustries, and Dean Breed of the Mar­
garet Morrison School, together with 
Mr. Hornbostel, who is Associate 
Dean of the School of Applied De­
sign.

The Board of Directors of the Art 
Society of Pittsburgh have heard with 
the most sincere regret of the sudden 
death of Charles Russell Hewlett, the 
President of the Society, and desire 
that the following minute be spread 
on the records of the Board as a me­
morial to him:
Mr. Hewlett became a member of 
the Art Society soon after his settle­
ment in Pittsburgh as one of the Fac­
ulty of the Carnegie Technical 
Schools, was elected a member of the 
Board of Directors of this Society 
in 1910 and became its President in 
the following year. From the first 
he took an active and most intelligent 
interest in the affairs of the Society, 
and after he was chosen to preside 
over its destinies was unremitting in 
his attention to its business and effec­
tive in his administration of it.
For some time prior to his accept­
ance of the direction of the Society’s 
fortunes, they had been somewhat on 
the wane, but under his zealous and 
earnest leadership a new interest was 
aroused and a progressive policy 
adopted which has added largely to 
the prestige of the Society, has prac­
tically doubled its membership and 
set it far ahead of its previous achieve­
ments in its chosen field. The splen­
did rejuvenation of the Society (one 
of Pittsburgh’s oldest and most hon­
ored institutions) was largely due to 
Mr. Hewlett’s personal enthusiasm, 
his unflagging energy, and his con­
ception of the proper aims and func­
tions of such an organization in such 
a community as this.
It is impossible to speak of his per­
sonality except in terms of the high­
est admiration and warmest apprecia­
tion. Richly endowed by nature with 
a vigorous intellect, a thorough feel­
ing for Art, and a most amiable dis­
position, his studious industry had 
added the rich culture and thorough 
training of the best Schools of Art. 
The result was a personality most 
interesting and 'charming in itself and 
most perfectly fitted for its chosen 
life-work. Abundantly equal to every 
emergency of his full and complicated 
career, he handled them all with un­
failing courtesy and tact, and he was, 
to a fault, unassuming and unaffected. 
His love of art was so pure, his am­
bition for its development so keen 
and disinterested, his method so sim­
ple and sincere, his .efficiency so 
marked and productive—it is certain 
that his sudden departure will leave 
a place almost impossible to fill in 
this community and in the various 
enterprises in which he had so large 
a part.
The members of this Board feel 
that while in Mr. Hewlett’s death 
they share with the Society the loss 
of an able, far-seeing and devoted 
executive, their personal loss is great­
er, since they must forever resign the 
comradeship of a man so sweet in 
temper, so sincere in character, so 
kind in manner, so rich in culture, so 
modest in pretension and so earnest 
in purpose.
Let this Minute be spread upon the 
records of the Society and an en­
grossed copy sent to the Mother and 
family of the deceased, whose great 
loss we can fully appreciate, and with 
whose overwhelming sorrow we 
warmly sympathize.

The last services for Dean Hewlett 
in Brooklyn were impressive because 
of their simplicity. The beautiful 
burial services of the Episcopal 
Church were read in Grace Church, 
Brooklyn by the rector, Dr. Wrigley, 
on Friday. In the church were 
gathered the many personal friends of 
Mr. Hewlett, some of whom had come 
great distances to pay respect to his 
memory, among them were several 
who had been fellow students with 
him in this country or abroad.
The music of the service was beau­
tifully rendered by the vested choir 
and added much to its solemn dig- 
ntiy. The house and church were 
filled with floral tokens. The inter­
ment was at Greenwood cemetery.
Mr. Hornbostel and three Design 
students, Messrs. Crosby, Thompson 
and Robertshaw, were honorary pall­
bearers. The schools were also rep­
resented by Dean Breed of the Mar­
garet Morrison, Dean Leete of the Ap­
plied Science and Dean Connelley of 
the Applied Industries Schools.

I am here on behalf of the students 
to express, however inadequately, our 
grief at the loss that we have just sus­
tained by the death of our Dean. We 
cannot make those who did not know 
him, even dimly understand how much 
he meant to our life here in school, 
and how much help and comfort he 
gave us in our work. He took such 
an intense and unselfish interest in the 
aims and ambitions of-each one of us. ' 
He tried so seriously to understand 
our difficulties, ând gavé so much of 
himself to us, that I think it is impos­
sible for us to realize yet the extent 
of our loss. But we know that we 
shall miss him more and more in the 
days to come.
Some of us' have known him for five 
year, some of us a little more than 
two months, but I think all of us— 
Architects, Decorators, ¦ Illustrators 
and Musicians—feel that we have lost 
a personal friend.
He was wonderfully fitted for his 
position and his accomplishments 
were many (though we never heard 
of them from himself). It was per­
haps his quiet unobtrusive way of 
concealing these that commanded our 
great respect. -.We went to him in 
every difficulty that arose at School, 
and his careful criticisms, his valued 
opinions, and his capable advice were 
ours to dispose of. 'Vi ¦
Many of us went to him in our pri­
vate difficùlties also—difficulties which 
had nothing whatever to? do with 
School—and came away feeling that if 
we had a friend in the world that 
friend was Mr. Hewlett.
His presence was an inspiration to 
us, his words gave us confidence and 
encouragement. He was a scholar 
and a gentleman—dignified in every­
thing that he did—and yet he had the 
frankness and quick sympathy of a 
child.
He is gone now—but his memory 
will always remain, and the remem­
brance of his ideals and ambitions for 
us, of his quiet strength and courage 
will help to make our work easier— 
our lives better and broader.

At a mass meeting Thursday after­
noon, November 13th,/"Dean Connel- 
ley gave a very appropriate talk to 
the students concerning the death of 
Dean Hewlett of the School of Ap­
plied Design.
It was decided that the student sen­
ate should send a letter of sympathy 
to the members of the faculty of the 
Design School. A floral contribution 
was taken and the manner in which 
the students responded was another 
evidence that Dean Hewlett was be­
loved by the students of all schools.
Thé Student’s Senate sent the fol­
lowing letter of sympathy to the Fac­
ulty of the Design School:
; ____ November 14, 1913.
To the Members of the Faculty, 
School of Applied Design,
Carnegie Inst, of Technology. 
Gentlemen:
The students of the School of Ap­
plied Industries, by unanimous action 
at a mass meeting held Thursday af­
ternoon, November 13th, voted to eix- 
tend to your body this expression of 
their sympathy in the death of Dean 
Hewlett.
As students, although of another 
department of the Institute, we as­
sure you that we feel, at least in a 
measure, the burden of your great 
loss. * , < •
Yours very sincerely,
THOMAS FISH, 
Chairman of the Student’s Senate.

son. Carnegie School wishes hereby to 
express its sorrow at the death of 
Dean Hewlett and to extend its sym­
pathy to his friends.and the members 
of his family. It is agreed by com­
mon consent that his loss is irrepar­
able, for he had that inward delicacy 
and-sensitiveness of thought, which is 
such a rare gift in men. This .quality 
combined with unusual kindness, sym­
pathy and a fine generosity made him 
,eminently fitted .for the position he 
filled. His character and influence 
can never be forgotten 1 by student 
body or faculty for he was a chosen 
man among us.
We send this message in the hope 
that it may bring some comfort to 
sorrowing hearts as you realize that 
you are not sorrowing alone but that 
we as a faculty are today sincerely 
mourning for a brilliant, loving man 
cut off at the height of his career.

The day’s work was done. The sun­
set after-glow faded in the west, and 
the smoke of a toil-burdened day rose 
slowly over the weary city to meet the 
lowering mantle of the. night.
After the cares of the day, we were 
walking homeward through a little 
side street half hidden in twilight 
shadows and the gray gloom of the 
jjreat Institute. It was the same little 
istreet that he trayeljed so often and 
knew so well. We were in the heart 
of the student quarter,-and had walked 
a moment in silence when the Dean, 
stopping before a house, said:
“You will excuse me, please. I 
must go in here a minute to see one 
of our students who is very ill with 
appendicitis. He has been much in 
my mind today, and I would know 
how he is before going home.”
It was the last time we walked to­
gether in the little street, and my last 
memory of Dean Hewlett. The inci­
dent recalled Wordsworth’s beautiful 
lines,
“That best position of a poor man’s 
life,—
His little, nameless, unremembered
acts
Of kindness and of love.”
The incident will not soon be for­
gotten for it revealed in a way so true 
to the -man all the sweetness and light 
of a noble and sympathetic soul—a 
soul the Master has claimed for his 
own.

At a recent meeting of the Glee 
Club it was decided to continue the 
giving'of a scholarship. .
Mrs. Vermocken addressed the club 
in a most entertaining way. She gave 
several suggestions which, if followed 
out, will make the Glee Club work 
very effective, by aiding the students 
to develop their musical and poetical 
talents. One of the suggestions was 
that the students write some school 
songs which will be received with 
pleasure by the manager. All stu­
dents, whether members of the club 
or not, should try writing a school 
song.

The members of the Guild met No­
vember tenth at noon and decided to 
hold a dance November twentv-first 
in the school in place of their annual 
bazaar. Owing to unexpected cir­
cumstances the date has been changed 
to December twelfth, and it is hoped 
that all the students of M. M. C. S. 
will attend.
The Guild is the only charitable 
organization in M. M. C. S. and the 
only way in the past it has had of 
raising money was by the annual 
bazaar. The committee in charge 
hopes that more money may be raised 
to use in forwarding worthy causes 
by a dance than by the bazaar. The 
price of admission is a dollar a couple, 
and everyone is promised a good time.
This will be the first real school 
dance ever to be given at M. M. C. S., 
as at this dance the girls from all the 
classes are cordially invited, and in 
order to make this an annual affair, all 
the students will have to be present 
on December twelfth.

Branches in all Principal Cities
going to Paris. For three years he 
studied art under the famous Lalloux 
in an atelier in Parris. For a couple' 
of years following he traveled through 
Europe and then studied for a time 
in Japan.
Coming to New York he took up 
the study of music in the New York 
Conservatory. He entered ’the firm 
of Lord & Hewlett, decorators, in 
New York, with whom he-, couf^nued 
for a number of years. Jie -then en­
tered the decorative field' as an inde­
pendent and painted the interior dec­
orations of a number of the metropo­
lis’ largest buildings, his mural paint­
ings having attracted much attention.
Prof. Hewlett came to Pittsburgh 
five years ago as professOtf of deco­
rations of the Technical Schools and 
was appointed dean in 1911. He was 
president of the Art Society of Pitts­
burgh, occupying that: position for 
two years, and having b.feen only re­
cently re-elected. To the dean is due 
much of the credit for the present 
state of development of that organiza­
tion which occupies a unique place in 
the field of art. He was a director of 
the Federation of Art, a national or­
ganization which has its headquarters 
in Washington, D. C., and was also 
a director of the Pittsburgh Archi­
tectural Club. He was a member of 
the Pittsburgh Athletic Association. 
He was an accomplished musician, his 
ability being probably most marked 
as a pianist. He was unmarried and 
resided with another member of the 
faculty, at 211 South Dithridge street. 
The professor was constantly in de­
mand at functions and events given 
by all forms of art societies and clubs 
in this city, his ability and knowl­
edge having won for him an enviable 
place in the estimation of all art con­
noisseurs in this city.
Prof. Hewlett received a diploma, 
which is practically a degree, from 
the Ecole des Beaux Arts of the Uni­
versity of Paris.
His mother, Mrs. James Augustus 
Hewlett, of Brooklyn; two brothers, 
Arthur and William Hewlett, mem­
bers of the firm of Lord & Hewlett, 
in New York, and three sisters, two 
of whom1 are Mrs. J. D. Brown of 
Philadelphia, and Mrs. A. G. Patter­
son, of Philadelphia, survive. His 
mother, brother Arthur and sister, 
Mrs. Patterson, were with him when 
death came.
Director Arthur A. Hamerschlag of 
the institute, made the following 
statement in regard to the dean’s 
death: “This is an almost irreparable 
loss. His wonderful career and serv­
ice to the students and the community 
in all fields of art will make us deeply 
regret our loss. The Pittsburgh Art- 
Society, of which he was president, 
and which he built up so tremendous­
ly, will find it almost impossible to 
replace him. He was the most versa­

DEATH OF DR. Z. T. MILLER.
Teacher in the Design School.
Simultaneous with the death of 
Dean Hewlett came word of the 
death of Dr. Z. Tv -Miller, teacher of 
artistic anatomy in the Design School.
Dr. Miller was a typical self-made 
man. He was born in Miami, Ohio; 
and when 15 years of age enlisted in 
the Sixty-first Ohio Volunteers as a 
musician. -He-served- throughout the 
war and wan for a time connected with 
the office of General -Carl Schurz. At 
the close of the .war he became a 
telegrapher. In 1872 he married Cath­
erine King and moved to this city 
a year later. Money earned in the 
telegraph business made possible his 
studies in the New. York Medical Col- 
ldge and the Philadelphia Medical 
College, where/ he received' a thor­
ough .training.1 Dr. Miller started’ his 
practice ; on i the , Northside, but re­
moved-.to the: Southside, where for 
35 years past he had earried on his 
practice. For 25 years .he had been 
at 2015 Carson street. He was known 
as an advocate of “high potency hom- 
eopathy”'and was called a “true Hah- 
nemannian.” Because of the number 
of fellow physicians who called upon 
him for treatment for their own ail­
ments, he was known as the “doc­
tors’ doctor.” He had held the high­
est offices in the County Society of 
Homeopathy, State Society of Hom­
eopathy and the American Institute 
of Homeopathy, of which he was past 
president and a senior. He was also 
a member of the International Hah- 
nemannian Association. He was a 
consistent opponent of compulsory 
vaccination and because of this was 
made president of the Pittsburgh 
Anti-Compulsory Vaccination Socie­
ty, and honorary vice president of the 
national society for that purpose. He 
was author of several books of verse 
and fiction. Besides being at the head 
of his profession he was also an ac- 
complished musician and painter.
Miss Louise Rive King Miller, a 
member of last year’s graduating 
class from the Design School, was his 
only child.

LAST YEAR’S TRACK MEN RE­
CEIVE SWEATERS.
In a quiet and pompless manner, the 
letter men of last year’s track team 
were given their sweaters during the 
past week. Contrary to the general 
method of awarding “C’s” to the 
members of athletic teams, no public 
presentation of the track sweaters 
was made. Five of the ten 1913 track 
letter men are still in school and de­
serve the same recognition other 
Tech athletes receive.
C. M. Crawford, captain of the 
team, stood out prominently , as the 
best individual point winner. His 
events were the high and low hurdles.
the quarter mile run and the relay 
race. Closely following him in num­
ber of points scored, were Haselton 
and Wright both of whom are pos­
sessors of records made during the 
1913 season. In the dual meet with 
Allegheny, Haselton lowered the 
Western Pennsylvania intercollegiate 
mark for two miles by running the 
distance in 10:261-5 minutes; and in 
the intercollegiate meet at Westmin­
ster,. Wright broke the school record 
in the pole vault when, with Patter­
son of Geneva, he cleared the bar at
11 feet. ,H. Murphy, and King with 
Wright took splendid care of the high 
jump, often preventing opponents 
from securing a single place. Mayer, 
competing in the 220 yard and 440 
yard dashes, was Tech’s best sprinter.
F. Murphy did good work in the 220 
yard dash and broad-jump at the 
Westinghouse indoor meet, winning 
both events and thereby his letter. 
Captain-elect Clair, Tech’s only rep­
resentative in the weight events, ex­
celled in throwing the hammer and 
landed several firsts. Patterson earned 
the coveted “C” by winning the broad 
jump in the Allegheny meet and 
Simpson defeated his team-mate, 
Haselton, for a first place in the two 
mile run in the Westinghouse meet. 
The management of the team was in 
the hands of Parry, who executed his 
duties in a capable manner.
The men just mentioned were the 
letter winners, but the roll of the 1913 
track team would not be complete 
without the names of Marks, Walrath, 
and Poynty, .who .finished second in 
the hundred yard dash, second and 
third in the half mile run, respectively, 
in the Westminster meet. These three 
runners missed making their letters 
only by a very few points.
The team’s work as a whole may 
be briefly summarized by citing its 
record of two victories out of the four 
letter meets. Westinghouse Club in 
a dual encounter and Westminster, 
Geneva and Grove City in a four-cor­
nered struggle were beaten, but Alle­
gheny and Penn State each defeated 
Tech.

When the final game for Carnegie 
is staged at Tech Field next Saturday, 
there should be the largest crowd of 
the faithful that has been in the stands 
this year. Jupiter Pluvius has been 
so unfavorable all season that he 
should at this time soften his heart 
and smile upon Pittsburgh for this 
one Saturday afternoon, at least.
Carnegie’s game with Haverford is 
the only collegiate football contest in 
the city for this week, so it should 
attract a large number of the follow­
ers of the sport who usually have to 
divide their interest.
This is the one game for which the 
manager reserves the right to charge 
the day students an extra fee of twen­
ty-five cents, according to the notice 
on the back of the season tickets. Ad­
mission tickets will be on sale as 
noted on the bulletin boards for all 
those holding student tickets.
The team is bound to win the last 
game and make the average for the 
season .500. After the light work of 
last week, the men are in the best of 
condition physically and are deter­
mined to repeat the trick turned on 
the Easterners last season.
This is the last chance to show that 
the student support this year is not 
poorer than ever before, as has been 
alleged with apparent justification. So 
don’t let twenty-five cents chill your 
loyalty, but be there.

The Science Soph. Chemists surely 
have stirred up a lot of football ma­
terial among their classmates. It all 
began when the “Bottle Washers” 
challenged the “Engine Wipers” to a 
football game. The Mechanicals ac­
cepted the challenge, but this was only 
the start. Imagine the shock when 
the “Live Wires” struck the limelight 
with a challenge to the winners of the 
first contest. Not t.o be outdone the 
“Stake Drivers,” with a sweeping 
challenge to all comers, last appeared. 
Thus the athletic field has been dotted 
recently with many football teams 
composed of loyal Sophomores, striv­
ing to bring the championship to their 
section.
Other teams desiring games should 
see Sawders of. the Chemists, Hen­
ning of the Mechanicals, Doherty of 
the Electricals, or Reno of the Civils.

The curtain is about to be lowered 
on the first act of the annual four act 
production at Tech entitled, “Ath­
letics,” which represents in turn the 
seasons of the four sports; football, 
basketball, baseball and track. In the 
meantime, the participants in the sec­
ond scene are preparing to take their 
turn before the footlights. Appear­
ing in the role of leading man will be 
W. H. Criswell, who will be support­
ed by a first rate company including 
J. P. Tumpane, G. M. Douthett, A. S. 
Hines, R. W. Colvin and others. To 
insure a successful performance a 
company larger than the present one 
is required. Manager McKee urges 
all players of much and mediocre abil­
ity to report for the preliminary try­
outs and rehearsals. These have late­
ly been taking place three times a 
week, but during the intermission be­
tween the first and second acts, they 
will be held daily at 5 P. M. on the 
stage at the Field House.
The program for the second act has 
not been quite completed, but will 
soon be announced. The cast will be 
under the direct supervision of Dr. W. 
L. Marks, whose reputation as a coach 
is well established in this community. 
To please its audience of Tech ad­
mirers is the sole aim of the entire 
company and to do this, they will ex­
ert every effort to successfully pro­
duce their act which this season has 
been specially named “The Winning 
Five.”

The football men will break training 
for the season with a banquet at the 
Schenley on Saturday night. Judging 
by the usual custom, there will be an 
evening of jollification, especially if 
the game is won.
Any student not on the squad may 
have the privilege of attending by 
paying an assessment of two dollars 
to Manager Haaren before the time 
set. Elaborate menu cards will make 
valuable souvenirs of the occasion.

On Friday of this week forty mem­
bers of the musical clubs will appear 
at Tally Cavey to give the first con­
cert of the season. The clubs will 
have a special private car for the trip 
to and from Pittsburgh. Upon ar- 
cival at Talley Cavey the Ladies’ Aid 
Society of the church will serve a 
sumptuous supper. The men who will 
take this trip are not to compose this 
year’s clubs by any means. Even by 
the time of the next concert many 
changes will be made. There is so 
much good new material that some of 
last year’s men will undoubtedly find 
it hard to hold a position.
The week following will be Thanks­
giving vacation week, so no concert 
will be given.
During the next week on Saturday, 
December 6th, the clubs will leave the 
Union Station at 4:00 for Marshalsea. 
Upon arriving they will have a sup­
per which will really be a banquet. 
The return trip will be made early, 
inasmuch as the last train leaves at 
9:50.
The following Friday, December 
12th, the clubs will appear at Hazel­
wood in Odd Fellows’ Hall. The 
concert will be under the auspices of 
the Men’s Bible Class of the Hazel­
wood Presbyterian Church. Just 
what will be done in regard to a re­
ception will be announced later.

Following out the revival program 
for the White Friars, the board of 
governors recently decided to give a 
dance to arouse more interest in the 
organization. This club, representing 
the amateur dramatic interests of the 
institute, belongs to the student body, 
just as any other activity, but this 
fact is not realized.
The date has been set for Thurs­
day, December 18, this being the last 
night before school closes for the 
Christmas vacation. The place will 
probably be the Field House, that 
being the best floor that could pos­
sibly be secured. The price will be 
small enough to allow anybody to be 
there.
It depends largely upon the interest 
shown whether there will be a show 
put on this year. If the students want 
a play, the best way to show their ap­
proval of the plans laid out by the 
club, will be to do missionary work
for this dance.
More details will be published in 
later issues of the Tartan and on the 
bulletin boards. But keep the dance 
in mind and remember the date, 
Thursday, December 18.

Makes little difference whether you 
believe in telepathy or hypnotism, 
“The Witching Hour,” Augustus 
Thomas’ subtle drama, interests you 
and gives you something to think 
about. It will be presented for the 
first time in stock by the Harry Davis 
Players at the Duquesne Theatre, 
Thanksgiving week.
In this play Mr. Thomas has surely 
added nothing to science; he may even 
have exceeded what science and com­
mon sense allow him of hypnotic and 
telepathic phenomena. But this at 
least he has done and well done. He 
has reached down through the crust 
of the commonplace for dim fires that 
smolder beneath, and in a drama of 
truth and power he has set a coal 
from whose fires to glow unceasingly. 
His attempt may be considered by 
some as audacious, but his achieve­
ment is deserving of the excellent re­
ward a discriminating and apprecia­
tive public has given it.
A bank that is strong in assets, in 
men, in courtesy and in the desire to 
make its services of practical value to 
every man or woman who favors it with 
his or her account.

Yale University will enter a team in 
the Intercollegiate Basketball League

the league last season on account of 
not receiving the necessary financial

We have classified our advertisers so that our readers may use the list 
for reference before making purchases. The grouping furnishes an excellent 
Variety' of merchants for any article which a student, alumnus or faculty 
member would be likely to buy, and there is no valid reason of which we are 
aware that would justify anyone interested in the welfare of The Tartan in 
making purchases from any but merchants who so kindly make such a publi­
cation possible. Be sure, also, to give one of the purchase stubs, which you 
will find enclosed in your Tartan every other week, to the clerk from whom1 
you make the purchase. The stubs, we have found, make pleased advertisers 
and help to get new ones. May we depend upon YOU to take this as a re­
sponsibility to your Institution and to The Tartan.

(Article published in “The Outlook,” 
of Oct. 18, 1913.
With the completion of the Panama 
Canal the relations between the United 
States and the tropics of South Amer­
ica will become increasingly intimate. 
Particularly is this statement true in 
regard to the Eastern seaports of the 
United States and the Western coast 
of that great continent lying below 
the Isthmus. Many regions in South 
America are afflicted with grave pes­
tilential diseases, the etiology and the 
method of transmission of which are 
alike unknown to medical science. As 
trade with these regions grows, the 
danger that these diseases may find 
entry into America will grow, too.
Combining a natural desire to help 
in forestalling such a possible tragedy 
with a desire to broaden the bounds, 
of medical knowledge, and to carry to 
our southern neighbors the lessons 
we have learned in Cuba and in Pana­
ma as to the advantages of preventive 
sanitation, the Harvard Medical 
School has established a Department 
of Tropical Medicine—the first school 
of its kind within the boundaries of 
this country. As soon as funds can 
be secured, Harvard also hopes to 
establish a hospital especially devoted 
to the study and treatment of tropi­
cal diseases. At present patients who 
have contracted diseases in the trop­
ics not infrequently wander about the 
United States from hospital to hos­
pital, until by chance they find some 
physician who has a knowledge of 
tropical medicine and who is able cor­
rectly to diagnose and treat the par­
ticular unfamiliar disease with which
each happens to be afflicted. For the 
past six months an expedition under 
the leadership of Dr. 'Richard P. 
Strong, who is the head of this new 
school, has been actively engaged in 
Ecuador and Peru in securing material 
for laboratory work at home and in 
studying the bacilli of tropical disease 
upon their native heath.
Part of this time the expedition 
made its headquarters at Guayaquil, 
perhaps one of the worst hotbeds of 
disease in tropical South America. 
Ex-Ambassador Bryce once charac­
terized this Ecuadorian port as “the 
pest-house of the continent.” An­
other authority has said, “I have vis­
ited many of the death-holes of the 
world, but I have yet to find one 
whose • unsanitary conditions equal 
those of Guayaquil.” From investiga­
tion in such a fertile field—from the 
bacteriologist’s standpoint — informa­
tion of importance to tropical Ameri­
ca must almost certainly result. There 
is an opportunity for great public 
service before the Harvard School of 
Tropical Medicine, and it could not 
be placed within reach of more capable 
hands.
The old system of using a heated
ii on and dirty cloth presses the grime

sanitary machine steams it all out, and
