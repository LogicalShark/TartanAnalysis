Olympus showcases innovations
BRIAN TRIMBOLI 
Assistant News Editor
The Project Olympus’s show 
and tell event gave alumni and 
other Carnegie Mellon af?li-
ates a chance to show off their 
latest innovations. 
The event, which took place 
last Thursday in the University 
Center’s McConomy Auditori-
um, attracted a large audience 
of students and alumni alike.
The event opened with a 
talk from Lenore Blum, found-
ing director of Project Olympus 
and professor of computer sci-
ence.
Project Olympus provides 
help to Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents and faculty who are 
trying to commercialize new 
ideas. 
According to its website, 
Project Olympus is, “bridging 
the gap between cutting-edge 
university research/innova-
tion and economy-promoting 
commercialization for the ben-
e?t of our communities.”
Blum talked about the 
role of students in many now-
prominent startups and the 
aggressive recruitment of stu-
dents by already-existing start-
up companies. 
“Our students are in great 
demand, and are getting fan-
tastic jobs at the coolest start-
ups on the planet. In fact, we 
were fueling — and we still are 
fueling — the high-tech econ-
omy across the planet,” Blum 
said.
The ?rst demonstration of 
the show-and-tell came from 
Jay Whitacre, a professor of 
materials science and engi-
neering and engineering and 
public policy, who gave a pre-
sentation about new ideas for 
energy storage using innova-
tive materials. 
“The more we look to inte-
grate renewable [energy sourc-
es] with the grid, the more we 
have to handle the intermit-
tencies of those renewables,” 
Whitacre said. “You can imag-
ine putting a very large battery 
with this kind of source. If you 
can do that, you can transform 
something that’s unreliable to 
something with a base load of 
a power.”
The next presentation, from 
professor of computer science 
Zico Kolter, also focused on en-
ergy research. 
As stated in the event’s pro-
gram, Kolter described “com-
putational approaches of sus-
tainable energy demands: how 
machine learning can help.” 
Kolter’s talk centered on 
ideas that would improve the 
power meters that homes al-
ready have by making them 
“smart meters,” which intelli-
gently monitor energy usage to 
promote conservation.
The next portion of the 
event was “a focus on startups 
and app developers” featur-
ing several Carnegie Mellon 
students and alumni, includ-
ing Matt Stewart (ETC ‘12), 
junior business management 
major Steve Musche, junior 
mechanical engineering major 
Arden Rosenblatt, and Ph.D. 
candidate in machine learning 
Prashant Reddy.
Stewart described his start-
up, Digital Dream Labs, which 
creates apps for the iPad to fos-
ter children’s learning. 
Musche talked about Know 
Your Style, a startup designed 
to make shopping easier for 
men by simplifying clothing 
options, while Rosenblatt talk-
ed about The PieceMaker — a 
3-D ?ash image slider — and 
the potential of 3-D printing 
technology. 
Reddy talked about Luma-
tor, a startup designed to help 
consumers make smarter en-
Jeffrey Zaslow remembered
JACKSON LANE 
Senior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon hosted a 
gala in memoriam of the late 
Jeffrey Zaslow and unveiled 
a plaque in his honor last Fri-
day.
Zaslow (H&SS ’80) was 
an accomplished journalist 
for The Wall Street Journal 
and a best-selling author. 
He passed away in February 
2012, at the age of 53, due to 
injuries suffered in a car ac-
cident.
 He is survived by his wife, 
Sherry Margolis, and three 
daughters, Jordan, Amber, 
and Eden, all of whom were 
in attendance at the memori-
al in the lobby of the Purnell 
Center.
Zaslow is probably best 
known as the co-author of 
The Last Lecture (2008), 
about the late Carnegie Mel-
lon professor of computer 
science Randy Pausch. 
Co-written with Pausch 
shortly after he was diag-
nosed with pancreatic cancer 
and given only a few months 
to live, the inspirational book 
is given to all incoming ?rst-
year classes to read prior to 
convocation.
In his opening remarks at 
the gala, President Jared Co-
hon remarked how the uni-
versity often asked Zaslow 
to speak at convocation and 
how Zaslow’s speeches could 
bring the ?rst-years to tears. 
“It is hard to believe that 
future classes won’t be able 
to hear him speak,” Cohon 
said.
The main speakers at 
the memorial included sev-
eral people who had known 
Zaslow personally during 
his undergraduate years at 
Carnegie Mellon. 
“[Zaslow] was by far my 
best student,” remarked pro-
fessor of creative writing and 
English Gerald Costanzo, a 
former professor of Zaslow. 
“His work was legendary, at 
least in the eyes of his profes-
sor… and also in the eyes of 
his peers.”
“Many people don’t know 
this story, but Jeff almost 
didn’t graduate from here 
[Carnegie Mellon]. Mid-
way through junior year, he 
actually transferred to Co-
lumbia,” said Fred Siegel, 
Zaslow’s roommate at Carn-
egie Mellon. 
According to Siegel, how-
ever, Zaslow quickly realized “he had made a terrible mis-

Senior chemical engi-
neering major Nancy Ko was 
selected as a fellow with the 
Congress-Bundestag Youth 
Exchange for Young Profes-
sionals (CBYX), a year-long, 
federally funded fellow-
ship for study and work in 
Germany.
Ko was among the 75 stu-
dents selected from an ap-
plicant pool of 600 for the 
fellowship program. CBYX is 
a scholarship exchange pro-
gram funded by the German 
Bundestag and the U.S. Con-
gress. Selected fellows are 
trained in business, techni-
cal, engineering, vocational, 
and agricultural ?elds while 
in Germany. In exchange, 
CBYX helps place young Ger-
man professionals in the U.S. 
to experience the American 
work ?eld.
Ko will attend a two-
month intensive German lan-
guage course, study at a uni-
versity or professional school 
for four months, and com-
plete a ?ve-month internship 
with a German company in 
her career ?eld.
“I’m extremely excited 
and honored to be part of this 
wonderful opportunity as I 
continue to pursue my career 
goals,” Ko said in a university 
press release. 
“My CMU studies have 
given me an excellent prob-
lem-solving platform for any 
job I will ultimately tackle.”
Head of the chemical en-
gineering department An-
drew Gellman also stated in 
a university press release, 
“We’re very proud of Nancy 
as she augments her CMU 
experience with a global 
look at how important the 
engineering profession is to 
a variety of industry sectors. 
Our students are leaders in 
developing novel solutions to 
a variety of pressing societal 
issues.”
This year marks the 30th 
anniversary of CBYX. Since 
1984, approximately 1,650 
Americans have been award-
ed this fellowship, an oppor-
tunity for them to gain cultur-
al, theoretical, and practical 
work experience while residi-
ing in Germany.
CMU senior wins prestigious fellowship
Qatar student develops car safety program
Sophomore business 
administration major Mo-
hammed Al Matwi at CMU 
Qatar developed a new and 
creative way to raise aware-
ness on the dangers of irre-
sponsible driving. His safety 
campaign, entitled Ahmeek 
(meaning “I’ll protect you” in 
Arabic), won him the award 
for the Carnegie Mellon’s 
Doha Community Engage-
ment Program (DCEP).
For his project, Al Matwi 
recruited 20 volunteers to 
stage ?ash-mob scenes on 
car safety and accidents 
across campus. “I felt that 
car safety is one of the issues 
that we are facing right now 
and that we should take ac-
tion,” Al Matwi said, quoted 
in a university press release.
“There is high incidence 
of car accidents in the coun-
try and I believe it’s time 
for us to step up and take 
action to effect change,” Ai-
sha Fakhroo, one of the vol-
unteers, told The Peninsula 
Qatar.
“The volunteers live the 
experience, feeling the emo-
tions that they show to the 
audience through the scenes. 
So both are in?uenced by the 
act — the volunteers who 
show the act and the people 
who see the act,” Al Matwi 
said. But he wants to take 
it to the larger community 
“[and make] it a sustainable 
project,” Al Matwi said.

Table-sharing initiative to take on Tazza D’Oro space issues
MADELYN GLYMOUR
Contributing Editor 
Since spring break, Tazza 
D’Oro has begun offering table-
sharing placards, backed by a 
Student Senate initiative.
The placards, available at 
the counter in the center of 
Tazza D’Oro, indicate that a 
person is willing to share his or 
her table with a stranger. The 
initiative is based on similar ta-
ble-sharing initiatives in some 
local cafés.
The Student Senate Busi-
ness Affairs Committee, head-
ed by second-year architecture 
student and CFA Senator Travis 
Rozich, chose Tazza D’Oro as a 
pilot location for the table-shar-
ing program because of its pop-
ularity and manageable size. 
“It’s a little smaller-scale,” 
said senior economics and 
statistics and decision science 
double major Will Weiner, who 
oversaw the program two years 
ago directly as Student Sen-
ate chair, and more remotely 
as student body president last 
year. “It’s a little bit easier to 
control, in terms of traf?c, to 
pilot it.” 
If table sharing goes well 
at Tazza D’Oro, Senate hopes 
to expand the program to the 
second ?oor of the University 
Center, where there have been 
space concerns.
So far, Rozich thinks the 
initiative is going well. “Every 
time I’ve been there I’ve seen 
people utilizing the program,” 
he said. Rozich said there was 
positive feedback to the origi-
nal announcement of the pro-
gram. “When we posted about 
table-sharing on the [Student 
Senate] Facebook with links to 
the article that we wrote on the 
Senate website, we had a lot of 
views — more views than we’ve 
had on our website,” he said. 
“We’ve had mostly positive sup-
port.” 
According to Rozich, Stu-
dent Senate will soon be pass-
ing out surveys at Tazza D’Oro 
to get feedback from students 
on the program.
If there is one obstacle to the 
table-sharing initiative, it may 
be lack of awareness.
Senior international rela-
tions and politics major Julie 
Kim, who comes to Tazza D’Oro 
two to three times a week, said 
that she would de?nitely share 
a table with someone who had 
put up a placard, and would 
probably pick up a placard her-
self — if she were aware of the 
program. 
“I feel like I would,” Kim said. 
“I guess I didn’t know about it.” 
Not everyone is as comfortable 
with the idea as Kim. Biomedi-
cal engineering Ph.D. student 
Natasha Loghmanpour, who 
was also unaware of the table-
sharing initiative, said that she 
would probably share a table 
with somebody who had picked 
up a placard. But as for picking 
one up herself? “Probably not,” 
Loghmanpour said. “It’s not my 
?rst choice, to be honest.” 
But Weiner thinks that if 
these initial hurdles can be 
overcome, the program shows 
promise. “If it can get estab-
lished and people accept that 
as the norm, it’ll be a good pro-
gram,” Weiner said. “It will help 
space be utilized better.”

Carnegie Mellon and Evive 
Station recently entered into 
a contract together to ?nd an 
ef?cient and cost-effective 
way of moving away from us-
ing disposable plastic water 
bottles on campus.
Founded in 2011 by Pitts-
burgh native and West Virgin-
ia University (WVU) graduate 
Thomas Petrini, Evive Station 
offers users the ability to sani-
tize and re?ll their reusable 
Evive bottles with puri?ed 
water, through the use of a 
device roughly the size of a 
vending machine.
According to the compa-
ny’s website, “Evive Stations 
are placed in high-traf?c ar-
eas on college or corporate 
campuses for free.”
Filling a bottle with wa-
ter takes 30 seconds; sanitiz-
ing and ?lling a bottle takes 
60 seconds. Upon hearing 
about the startup, School of 
Computer Science Director of 
Buildilng Facilities Jim Skees 
says that the university was 
interested.
“It’s something we had re-
ally thought about. Plastic 
bottles of Dasani water and 
bottles out of vending ma-
chines are expensive and gen-
erate a lot of waste. And many 
bottles end up in land?lls. So 
when Evive came up to us, 
it was almost too good to be 
true.”
The water from Evive is 
different from normal water 
fountains, Skees points out.
“These are machines 
which ?lter water and can 
also wash bottles, sanitize 
with chlorine, and 
?ll water bottles. 
And the only 
cost for a user 
would be the 
bottle, which is 
$10. And we only 
have to pay the 
cost for electri-
cal utilities, with 
the machines be-
ing monitored and 
restocked when 
needed by the com-
pany. In fact, their 
income comes not 
so much from bottle 
sales but from adver-
tisement spots on the 
machine.”
So far, there has 
been limited exposure to the 
Evive machines on campus, 
with only one machine cur-
rently installed.
“It launched several weeks 
ago on Gates six,” Skees said. 
“We really only want to have 
it as SCS space right now, but 
hopefully Evive will have oth-
er spots, including possibly in 
Tepper.”
“They are rapidly expand-
ing though,” he said. “There 
are Evive machines in WVU, 
Slippery Rock, and plans 
with American Eagle Out?t-
ters and UPMC. They’ve been 
pleasant to work with, and 
there doesn’t appear to be a 
catch or anything in 
small print.”
Students seem 
to be accepting 
of having Evive 
machines around 
campus.
“It’s better 
for the environ-
ment,” ?rst-year 
architecture ma-
jor Carter Nel-
son said. “[It’s 
also] better to 
promote ... over 
... plastic water 
bottles [that] 
would harm the 
environment.”
“As long as it wouldn’t af-
fect our tuition, yeah, I’m all 
for it,” said ?rst-year mechan-
ical engineering major Luke 
Tsai.
People who are interested 
in having specially compat-
ible Evive bottles can register 
on evivestation.com, and can 
create a pro?le where they 
can view how many plastic 
bottles they have saved.

egie Mellon a mere two weeks 
later.
Assistant Dean of Student 
Affairs Anne Witchner em-
phasized how Zaslow’s gift for 
writing in part stemmed from 
his genuine interest in other 
people.
“The university frequently 
brought Jeff back to speak 
to the English staff and stu-
dents…. [When talking to 
students after his speeches] 
he wouldn’t leave until he had 
talked to everyone waiting to 
talk to him,” Witchner said.
She explained that she 
could tell that those students 
were sharing conversations 
that they hadn’t shared with 
anyone else.
After the speakers, Cohon 
closed the event by introduc-
ing the new plaque commem-
orating Zaslow and announc-
ing the Endowed Jeffrey L. 
Zaslow Scholarship for Writ-
ing Students.
Cohon emphasized how 
Zaslow’s plaque stands facing 
the plaque commemorating 
Pausch at the Purnell-side en-
trance of the Pausch Bridge, 
emphasizing the relationship 
between the two men.
While Cohon stressed how 
unfortunate it is that incom-
ing classes will now never get 
a chance to meet Zaslow, he 
suggested that “future gener-
ations of students to come will 
turn to read this plaque when 
crossing the Pausch Bridge … 
and know what an incredible 
man Zaslow was.”
CMU accomplishments displayed
ergy choices.
The show-and-tell then 
featured students from Tar-
tanHacks, introduced by the 
founder and the director of 
ScottyLabs, senior computer 
science major Amy Quispe 
and junior human-computer 
interaction major Julia Teitel-
baum, respectively.
Teitelbaum described Tar-
tanHacks as a hacking compe-
tition that differs from other, 
similar offerings.
“We wanted TartanHacks 
to be a different kind of hack-
athon, in a couple of different 
ways. We wanted it to ad-
dress a more diverse crowd of 
students, and to place more 
value on innovative ideas and 
participants’ learning, and not 
just a technical challenge,” Te-
itelbaum said.
The “TartanHacks Stars,” 
as the event’s program calls 
them, were sophomore infor-
mation systems major Kevin 
Schaefer, sophomore com-
puter science major Hayden 
Demerson, sophomore elec-
trical and computer engi-
neering major Shane Smith, 
junior computer science ma-
jors Avesh Singh and Daniel 
Deutsch, and senior human-
computer interaction majors 
Kristina Lustig and Michael 
Helmbrecht. 
The last portion of the 
event was a short lecture from 
Shanna Tellerman (CFA ’03, 
ETC ’05), titled “The Entre-
preneurial Mindset.”
The Project Olympus 
show-and-tell concluded with 
a reception in the Univer-
sity Center’s Connan Room, 
where attendees could meet 
the entrepreneurs who had 
presented while sampling the 
new technologies hands-on.

Rain fails to dampen 19th annual Mobot competition
BROOKE KUEI
Assistant SciTech Editor
When Pittsburgh was 
awakened by heavy down-
pour Friday morning, many 
were skeptical about whether 
the 19th Annual Mobot Races 
would still take place. But as 
noon approached, the rain 
died down to a drizzle and 
eventually subsided, and a 
crowd gathered around the 
course outside Wean Hall.
The course consists of a 
white path drawn on the side-
walk outside Wean Hall. The 
line starts above the stairs and 
quickly transitions into a 28-
inch downhill drop. The course 
then becomes a series of wind-
ing turns with several small 
metal gates through which 
the mobot must pass. After an-
other 46-inch drop, the mobot 
must face the last part of the 
course: decisionpoints. In this 
part of the course, there are 
several points at the which the 
white path branches into two 
and the mobot must correctly 
choose the one leading to the 
next gate or else risk following 
a diverted path that results in 
a longer course time.
Greg Armstrong, a se-
nior research technician at 
the Carnegie Mellon Robot-
ics Institute, was the Mobot 
Race announcer. Dressed 
in a traditional Scottish kilt 
and carrying a very realistic-
looking sword, Armstrong 
amused the crowd with fun 
facts about Pittsburgh as the 
crowd watched the competi-
tors brave the wet and windy 
course conditions.
The ?rst competitor was  
StringRay, a one-man team 
consisting of electrical and 
computer engineering mas-
ter’s student Kwabena Agye-
man. StringRay could only 
make it through one gate on 
its ?rst trial; it was soon fol-
lowed by three other mobot 
competitors.
Megubot was a father-
daughter team consisting of 
Megan McKelvey, a former C-
Mite student, and her father, 
Terry McKelvey. Revo was a 
one-man team and consisted 
of senior electrical and com-
puter engineering major Dan-
iel Jacobs. MoBoss was much 
larger and consisted of electri-
cal and computer engineering 
?rst-years Cosku Acay, Edwin 
Cho, Kenneth Li, Nishant Pol, 
and Oguz Ulgen, and ?rst-year 
mechanical engineering major 
Sam Zeng.
The results of the 19th 
Annual Mobot Races are as 
follows: in the Open Class 
category, StringRay took ?rst 
prize, passing through Gate 5 
with a time of 1:08.48; in the 
Exhibition category, Megubot 
got through Gate 11 with a 
time of 1:31.25; in the Un-
dergraduate category MoBoss 
received ?rst prize, moving 
through Gate 12 with a time 
of 1:48.37, and Revo received 
second prize, moving through 
Gate 9 with a time of 1:12.10.
The Mini-Challenge, which 
occurred the Wednesday be-
fore the Mobot Races, consists 
solely of the race course be-
tween the two drops (before 
the area with decision points). 
Revo completed the Mini-
Challenge in 33.36 seconds 
and MoBoss completed it in 
24.86 seconds.
On race day, each team 
had three chances to complete 
the course. The ?rst and sec-
ond rounds occurred during a 
break in the rain, but it start-
ed raining again for the third 
round. For each race,  mem-
bers of the crowd would crane 
their necks and walk along 
the concrete sidewalk as the 
mobots advanced forward in 
the course. Each time a mobot 
passed through a gate, Arm-
strong would lead the crowd 
in a cheer: “Hip, hip, hooray!”
One time, after the crowd 
cheered loudly for a mobot 
passing through a gate, the 
mobot jerked toward the side 
and ran off the track. “Maybe 
the mobot had sound sensors,” 
a man in the crowd mused. 
“Did we scare it?” While this 
prediction is probably far-
fetched, there were many 
other factors that affected the 
performance of the mobots. 
For example, since it rained 
before the start of the races, 
there were patches of the con-
crete that were wet and darker 
than the rest of the sidewalk. 
Some of the mobots had trou-
ble ?nding the white line in 
such patches.
According to Dan Bothell 
(SCS ’96), who was once an 
undergraduate competitor of 
the Mobot Races and is now 
on the committee that helps 
run it, the Mobot Races have 
evolved substantially over  
the past few years. While 
the early-year mobots used 
simple light sensors and basic 
custom-built controllers, more 
recent mobots use much more 
advanced technology, such as 
the built-in cameras found in 
smartphones. “The interesting 
thing about that,” said Bothel, 
“is that even with the extra 
computing power available, it 
is still a dif?cult task.”
We walk past the mobot 
course on our way to class

how challenging a task it is.
HOW THINGS WORKInternet with no strings attached
NIVEDITA CHOPRA

You have probably used 
Wi-Fi at least once — on cam-
pus, at airports and coffee 
shops, or at home. Have you 
ever paused to think of how 
this super-convenient means 
of Internet connectivity actu-
ally works?
The Internet basically 
works through an exchange 
of data between devices, typi-
cally a client (the device that 
you are using) and a server, 
which processes your request 
for web pages and sends them 
to your device. Traditionally, 
these devices are connected 
through physical wiring. Mod-
ern Wi-Fi does away with the 
need for these wires by allow-
ing the exchange of data wire-
lessly through radio waves.
Wi-Fi-enabled devices have 
an embedded chip called the 
wireless network adapter. This 
chip is responsible for gener-
ating radio waves correspond-
ing to the requested web re-
source and transmitting them 
to the surrounding space. 
These waves are received by 
a router, which then forwards 
the request to the appropriate 
server through a wired con-
nection. When the requested 
web page is received at the 
router, it transmits corre-
sponding radio waves back to 
the device.
According to the website 
howstuffworks.com, the radio 
waves used in Wi-Fi transmis-
sions are typically of high fre-
quency — in the range of 2.4 
to ?ve gigahertz. The high fre-
quency allows these waves to 
transmit much more data than 
ordinary radio waves, such 
as those used in cellphones, 
walkie-talkies, and televisions.
The routers that help estab-
lish Wi-Fi are the key compo-
nents of wireless access points, 
popularly known as hotspots. 
According to the Encyclopedia 
Britannica, these hotspots typ-
ically have a range of less than 
100 meters (330 feet), but can 
be limited to a room or house 
by radio-wave-blocking walls. 
They can also be extended to 
cover large areas, such as col-
lege campuses, through multi-
ple overlapping access points, 
which reinforce the network. 
Incidentally, Carnegie Mel-
lon was the ?rst college cam-
pus to set up a campus-wide 
Wi-Fi network. This network, 
dubbed “Wireless Andrew,” 
was set up in 1993, long be-
fore Wi-Fi gained its current 
popularity.
Nowadays, laptops, smart-
phones, tablets, and other de-
vices are manufactured with 
the embedded wireless net-
work adapter chip. This en-
ables the device to detect and 
connect to hotspots within 
range. Since this chip is uni-
versal, it allows the device to 
access a Wi-Fi hotspot any-
where in the world.
Setting up a Wi-Fi hotspot 
is easy. To set it up in a home or 
private space, all you need is a 
router that contains a wireless 
access point and either a digi-
tal subscriber line modem or a 
cable modem. These are wide-
ly available and can be easily 
installed at a convenient spot. 
Several compatible devices 
can simultaneously use a sin-
gle router. In public spaces, 
cellular companies typically 
provide Wi-Fi, allowing their 
subscribers to access their re-
spective hotspots.
Wi-Fi is very convenient, 
since hotspots are unobtrusive 
and relatively easy to set up 
compared to wired networks. 
However, wireless connection 
is not as secure as its wired 
counterpart: An intruder can 
tap into the Wi-Fi and inter-
cept the communication to 
and from your device. Hence, 
it is typically advisable not to 
access sensitive data online 
while tapping the Wi-Fi in 
public places like airports or 
coffee shops.
Wi-Fi connections like the 
one at Carnegie Mellon and 
in most homes are password 
protected and locked to out-
siders. Thus, they provide an 
additional layer of security, 
but only if a strong password 
is used. Carnegie Mellon pro-
vides the campus community 
with an even more secure 
Wi-Fi service called “CMU-
SECURE,” which addresses 
various vulnerabilities typi-
cal in Wi-Fi networks. Thus, 
as frequently as possible, 
you should try to connect to 
“CMU-SECURE” while on 
campus.
Mystery surrounds Chinese bird ?u
With 82 cases of a new 
bird ?u in China, public 
health of?cials are trying to 
determine how the virus is 
spread. The virus, H7N9, has 
been detected in poultry, pi-
geons, chickens, and ducks. 
The World Health Organiza-
tion, however, stresses that 
some of people infected have 
not had contact with birds. 
There is also little evidence 
that the virus is spread be-
tween humans.
The outbreak in China has 
killed 17 people and hospital-
ized many more with severe 
respiratory problems. Most 
of the human cases have oc-
curred near Shanghai, al-
though two isolated incidents 
have been found in Beijing.

Mice and humans enjoy being carried
According to a report 
published in Current Biol-
ogy, both human and mouse 
infants calm down simply by 
being held by their parents. 
The researchers believe that 
this calm may be advanta-
geous for the survival of both 
the parent and infant; it is 
much easier for parents to 
escape a predator with a baby 
in a trance-like state.
The scientists attached a 
heart monitor to 12 human 
babies and observed them 
while their mothers sat them 
up, placed them in a crib, 
and carried them. The babies 
immediately relaxed when 
picked up by their mothers. 
Similarly, the mice infants 
relaxed and had a decreased 
heart rate when carried by 
their mothers.

Scientists question cause of drought
Climate change was prob-
ably not the cause of the 2012 
droughts in the U.S. midwest, 
according to a report released 
by the United States National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Association (NOAA). Some 
climate scientists have ques-
tioned this conclusion.
The NOAA scientists ran 
computer simulations in or-
der to determine why fore-
casts failed to predict the 
droughts. Their simulations 
inferred that the droughts 
would have occurred regard-
less of global warming, and 
instead blame it on natural 
variability in the atmosphere. 
Some climate scientists dis-
agree, saying that the climate 
models used were insuf?cient.

Rats receive new engineered organ
Researchers stripped a 
rat’s kidney of its cells and 
repopulated it with new 
ones, showing that a bioengi-
neered kidney can function in 
a similar manner to a normal 
one. Dr. Harald Ott of Har-
vard Medical School took the 
kidney of a rat cadaver and 
removed its cells by putting it 
in detergent. This process left 
behind only the extracellular 
matrix and collagen that act-
ed as a scaffold for cells. Ott 
then repopulated the kidney 
with neonatal rat cells and 
human red blood cells. The 
bioengineered kidney was 
then reinserted into a live rat.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
Joint Funding Committee’s budget remarks out of line
Social media is unreliable as a source for real news
First-year undeclared CFA stu-
dent Jordan Wu created a petition 
last week through change.org to 
challenge the university’s proposed 
new Smart ID card designs.
The petition was shared among 
students on Facebook and received 
227 signatures before closing. In 
the petition’s description, Wu told 
students, “I would be embarrassed 
showing any of these designs to 
anyone as a representation of our 
school.”
While it is justi?able for students 
to petition an unsatisfactory change 
on campus, The Tartan wants to see 
much of the fervor that was shown 
over the ID designs channeled to-
ward more pressing matters. ID 
designs affect most people on cam-
pus, as students use them on a daily 
basis, but the image on the IDs will 
not directly impact a student’s well-
being. Admittedly, the designs are 
part of campus culture, but they do 
not de?ne it and will not change the 
image of Carnegie Mellon to outside 
parties.
Meanwhile, more important 
Carnegie Mellon issues have not 
caused nearly the same amount of 
student concern. For example, both 
Carnegie Mellon’s 10-year expan-
sion plan and student elections are 
vastly more relevant to student life, 
but have not received nearly as much 
attention. The 10-year plan proposes 
changes to Carnegie Mellon’s physi-
cal campus that will directly and sig-
ni?cantly alter students’ daily lives, 
while student elections affect every-
thing from what happens on campus 
to our school’s image to the rest of 
the world. 
These issues are more important 
than the designs of our new IDs, 
and should generate just as much or 
more controversy among the student 
body than the designs did.
Regardless of one’s stances on 
these controversies, issues much 
larger than the new proposed ID 
designs exist on campus. If students 
gave as much attention to these is-
sues as they have to the new ID de-
signs, they would be a true catalyst 
for change.
The Joint Funding Committee 
(JFC)’s appeals process for 2014 or-
ganization budgets concluded last 
week, leaving many student leaders 
and organization members unhappy 
with the treatment they received 
from the JFC. Comments and excep-
tions made on BudgetTracker during 
the approval process are incongru-
ous with the professionalism the JFC 
is supposed to uphold.
WRCT’s budget feedback largely 
consisted of the JFC asking why 
the radio station’s equipment keeps 
breaking; Amnesty International’s 
campus chapter, which request-
ed funding for documentary ?lm 
screenings, was left with the remark, 
“Find cheaper movies”; and the JFC 
made a comment at the end of Sus-
tainable Earth’s budget that “Your 
FY12 audit showed you really don’t 
understand the concept of budget-
ing. Your current year spending is 
not really in line with your budget 
either. The JFC would like to meet 
with you prior to giving you any 
money. Please appeal.; appeal grant-
ed. Don’t screw it up, Matt.” 
Other organizations received 
similar rude comments. On the 
Scotch’n’Soda budget, many un-
professional comments were made. 
One comment pointed out that the 
theater group had misnamed a type 
of tape they were requesting money 
for: “It’s actually called fabric tape…
..#VPFdoestheatre.”
With respect to budget increases, 
the AB Concerts budget increased to 
$232,825 after the appeals process, 
an increase from the pre-appeals 
?gure of $196,785. AB Concerts did 
not ask for this increase, according to 
AB Concerts co-chair Rebecca Paren. 
Both of these ?gures are substan-
tially larger than the $130,790 the 
organization operated with last year. 
Giving an organization more money 
than what it requested is unprec-
edented, at least since 2010, accord-
ing to BudgetTracker. 
While next year will be the 100th 
Spring Carnival — and it’s under-
standable that students would want 
to celebrate accordingly — this 
$102,035 increase for one event 
comes at the expense of numerous 
other organizations that now have to 
operate on limited budgets.
Additionally, the only organiza-
tion to receive an exception from the 
strictly implemented JFC funding 
guidelines for food was AB Tech. The 
JFC’s guidelines do not allow fund-
ing for “personal food”; however, AB 
Tech’s BudgetTracker comment said, 
“Exception made for you guys cause 
you work so darn hard.”
These inappropriate comments, 
coupled with what appears to be fa-
vorable treatment of certain organi-
zations, demonstrate unacceptable 
behavior by the JFC. Budgets for 
student groups dramatically affect 
student life. They determine what an 
organization can afford and contrib-
ute to the quality of these groups. By 
their nature, budget cuts are upset-
ting for those who are affected by 
them.
The JFC must be aware of the im-
pact that their funding allocations 
have and professionally address allo-
cations with respect to the organiza-
tion members that work hard to ful-
?ll the interests of the student body.

The Boston Marathon bomb-
ing was a horrible event that chal-
lenged the sense of security we take 
for granted every day. The citywide 
lockdown that occurred the follow-
ing Friday further challenged that 
safety, as the Boston Police Depart-
ment tried to capture the suspects. 
In the midst of this terrible series of 
events, shortcomings of social media 
came to light.
Many people ?rst heard of the at-
tacks over Facebook or Twitter, and 
even after initial reports from of?cial 
news sources, the American public 
kept to its social Internet sources — 
or to social entertainment sites such 
as Reddit — to receive live updates 
from people on or near the scene. 
These sources, though useful, come 
with drawbacks, particularly unreli-
ability of information. As a result of 
this increased use of hasty Internet 
updates, many people believed in-
formation before it was con?rmed or 
denied by news sources.
While spreading important news 
as quickly as possible is a commend-
able goal of social media websites, 
users need to be aware that sources 
for that information, often average 
citizens, usually do not con?rm the 
reports they are posting. 
One of the most prominent cases 
of misinformation was the accusa-
tions against Sunil Tripathi, a Brown 
University student who has been 
missing since March 16. A thread 
on the Boston “subreddit” — which 
has since been deleted — incorrectly 
identi?ed Tripathi as one of the sus-
pects in the bombings.
Clearly, individuals already turn 
to social media for instant updates. 
However, with this growing trend 
in mind, users need to be aware that 
these sources are not as reliable as 
traditional news sources. While they 
may be useful for learning prelimi-
nary information about an event, 
they should only be used as a catalyst 
to ?nd out more information from 
reliable sources. 
In the case of the bombings, Face-
book or Twitter could con?rm that 
the bombings had in fact happened, 
while more reputable news sources 
could provide speci?c information 
on the number of victims, the status 
of the investigation, or the names of 
suspects.
Social media presents an im-
mense opportunity for information 
to quickly spread among Internet 
users. However, users also risk learn-
ing incorrect information that — in 
the midst of a tragedy like the Bos-
ton bombing — could provide false 
hope, elicit false accusations, or 
present a scenario that may change 
public understanding of how dan-
gerous the situation truly is.
Students should petition more urgent issues than IDs
WILLIAM PARK
Gun control legislation always 
faced an uphill climb — even with 
great public support. According to a 
recent poll by The Washington Post 
and ABC News, 86 percent of Ameri-
cans support background checks for 
gun purchases. A CBS News poll has 
it as high as 90 percent. So why can’t 
the Senate agree with the public?
Last Wednesday, gun control 
amendments to expand background 
checks and ban assault weap-
ons failed to reach the necessary 
60 votes in the Senate. President 
Obama called it “a pretty shameful 
day for Washington.” Although the 
bipartisan Toomey-Manchin amend-
ment to expand background checks 
raised hopes for a Republican com-
promise, that was not the case. Only 
four out of 45 Republican Senators 
joined 48 out of 53 Democrats to 
vote in support of the bill, according 
to The New York Times.
In hindsight, it’s easy to point 
?ngers, but placing blame on others 
should not be a focus. Some could 
say that President Obama abused his 
bully pulpit, parading the parents of 
Newtown, Conn. to shame congress-
men. Others could say that Repub-
licans are too conservative, stuck in 
the last century, and still can’t accept 
their embarrassing defeat in the last 
election. One can easily ?nd differ-
ent people to point ?ngers at. But 
that accomplishes nothing and does 
little to help the country progress.
As suggested by a recent report 
from The Hill, the fate of gun control 
lies in the public’s hands. However, 
the public cannot vote on amend-
ments. That power lies in the hands 
of what Nate Silver of The New York 
Times calls an ideologically divided 
House and a Senate that allows 
small conservative states to have 
just as much power as bigger blue 
states. Yet it is a Congress comprised 
of members who are voted into of-
?ce by the citizens, and hereon lies a 
very fundamental problem.
Many Congressmen don’t feel the 
pressure from 90 percent of Ameri-
cans because the only people they 
are worried about are those who 
have votes from their districts. With 
so many voting districts moving to 
extremes, there is little motivation 
for compromise — especially when 
considering the fact that Congres-
sional re-elections are two to four 
years down the road. So unless we 
all pack up and move to North Da-
kota, it seems as if we’re in the same 
state as before: stuck.
But it isn’t hopeless. The climate 
for compromise seems to be slowly 
taking shape. Obama’s new pro-
posed budget features concessions 
on his part to cut Medicare and 
Social Security. Bipartisan immi-
gration reform seems to be gaining 
momentum. Last week, 95 Sena-
tors also voted to improve mental 
health treatment, according to The 
Huf?ngton Post.
So let’s start here and work our 
way up. Let’s encourage our leaders 
to ?nd a middle ground. Our politi-
cal system might make reform dif?-
cult to achieve, but pointing ?ngers 
won’t get us anywhere, even if there 
is plenty of blame to go around.

Leaders must cease ?re over gun control laws
President of Venezuela needs to ?ll big shoes
XIYU WANG
Nicolas Maduro was sworn in as 
Venezuela’s president last Friday to 
replace Hugo Chavez. Chavez, the 
former Venezuelan president who 
died in March from cancer, hand-
picked his former vice president and 
long-time ally as his successor.
Maduro, like Chavez, came 
from a working-class background. 
A former bus driver who became a 
union trade leader and politician 
in Chavez’s cabinet, Maduro cam-
paigned on the platform of continu-
ing Chavez’s legacy — a commit-
ment to Venezuela’s lower classes 
and toward crafting Venezuela into 
a South American socialist state. 
In fact, much of Maduro’s electoral 
success is due to Maduro’s af?liation 
with Chavez, who retains a great 
deal of popularity among Venezu-
elans. Maduro’s campaign stressed 
that a vote for Maduro would be like 
a vote for the former president.
However, looking ahead, Maduro 
cannot simply rely on his association 
with Chavez to succeed. Although 
Chavez still has ardent supporters, 
his popularity in the past few years 
has been declining mainly due to the 
state of the Venezuelan economy.
Venezuela has the world’s larg-
est oil reserves, but during Chavez’s 
reign, there was a huge surge in gov-
ernment spending, contributing to 
an increase in Venezuela’s national 
debt and an increase in in?ation. 
Furthermore, Venezuela currently 
has a very controlled economy. 
Chavez nationalized many compa-
nies in Venezuela and maintained 
price and currency controls, which 
have deeply weakened the private 
sector, according to Yahoo! News.
However, in his campaign, Mad-
uro did not propose initiatives that 
would tackle these economic issues, 
instead focusing on social issues 
such as crime and corruption. Fur-
thermore, his economic initiatives 
could contribute to higher in?ation, 
such as raising the monthly mini-
mum wage by up to 45 percent, ac-
cording to The Wall Street Journal.
Maduro’s mandate is also par-
ticularly weak; in an extremely close 
election, Maduro only won 50.6 
percent of the vote while facing op-
posing candidate Henrique Capriles. 
The opposition has even questioned 
the legitimacy of Maduro’s victory, 
placing further doubts on whether 
Maduro truly has the popularity 
needed to carry him through.
Succeeding the divisive, charis-
matic, and forceful Chavez, Maduro 
has big shoes to ?ll, and it is unclear 
whether he has the foresight, te-
nacity, or charisma to pull himself 
through the harder times. Maduro 
must maintain a dif?cult balancing 
act between politics, pragmatism, 
and popularity if he wants Venezu-
ela, and his presidency, to succeed.

A PERSON’S OPINION
April 22, 2013 « The Tartan thetartan.org/forum » A7
The Tartan had a good time during Carnival. So we asked,
What was your favorite part of Carnival?
BRADEN KELNER
Students look forward to Car-
nival every year, but not for the 
reasons that most alumni return 
to campus. Carnival should not be 
characterized by the large amounts 
of alcohol that many students con-
sume during the festival.
Yes, we’re all college students 
and Carnival may seem like one of 
the only times when Carnegie Mel-
lon students can relieve their stress, 
so it may be obvious that they want 
to go crazy. 
However, there’s a difference be-
tween drinking with friends while 
socializing, and drinking dangerous 
quantities of alcohol that can have 
lasting effects on your body.
It’s no secret that students on 
campus celebrate Carnival by boast-
ing about  alcohol consumption. The 
Carnegie Mellon-famous Tumblr 
blog, cometomymellon.tumblr.com, 
posted a meme for last year’s Car-
nival reading “Happy F****** Car-
nival” with accompanying pictures 
of alcoholic beverages. Meanwhile, 
doyouhearbagpipes.tumblr.com, 
another Carnegie Mellon-themed 
Tumblr blog, dedicated a post to the 
event this year with pictures of peo-
ple guzzling alcohol.
Meanwhile, there were no al-
lusions to the attractions that al-
lure people from beyond the stu-
dent body to Carnival. The website 
isitcarnivalyet.com answered the 
website’s question with phrases like, 
“No, but it’s never too early to pre-
game.”
While there is no problem with 
drinking alcohol during Carnival (if 
you’re of age, of course), drinking to 
the point of bodily harm — which 
many students look forward to most 
— should not be the festival’s focus, 
especially when there are so many 
events and opportunities to take ad-
vantage of during Carnival. 
It would be a shame not to re-
member or to miss these events 
due to the negative effects of alco-
hol. Of course, there’s Booth and 
Buggy, Carnival’s two main attrac-
tions. There are also less-hyped 
events like Mobot, Downhill Derby, 
Scotch’n’Soda’s annual Carnival 
production, and opportunities to 
network with alumni.
What is the point of going to 
Booth drunk? Students work count-
less hours for these impressive 
structures. Having the experience 
of Booth distorted by alcohol does 
not allow students to truly appreci-
ate the work that their peers put into 
it — same goes for the robots, art, 
and shows that students produce 
for Mobot, Downhill Derby, and 
Scotch’n’Soda, respectively.
This festival happens once a year. 
Taking the time to soberly and re-
spectfully view the attractions at 
Carnival may even make this annual 
event more enjoyable each spring.
There are also several alumni 
events during Carnival, which give 
students the opportunity to meet 
former students. Choosing to con-
sume alcohol during the day may 
cause students to miss these prime 
opportunities for networking.
I don’t have a problem with 
drinking casually in the evenings 
with friends during Carnival. What 
bothers me is the mentality that 
students will drink excessively sim-
ply because they can, making them 
unable to appreciate the attractions 
during the day or the morning after 
a heavy night of alcohol consump-
tion — not to mention the physical 
danger of this mentality.

Carnival should not be characterized by alcoholCarnival is a time for letting loose
CHLOE THOMPSON
Carnival is the only time of year 
that Carnegie Mellon students have 
to really have some fun. The annual 
festival happens in the spring se-
mester, and after 99 years, Carnival 
is pretty well ingrained in Carnegie 
Mellon culture. Students look for-
ward to it every year, and alumni 
come back to visit with their fami-
lies over the course of the weekend. 
Carnival also has a bit of a reputation 
around campus as the time when 
students temporarily forget that they 
don’t actually go to a party school.
This momentary change in men-
tality is not a bad thing — students 
need this time to de-stress. Carnegie 
Mellon students work hard during 
their academic year, but spring se-
mester can be especially stressful 
at times. Carnival is a way to kick 
back and relax in a variety of ways, 
by going on all of the Carnival rides, 
watching buggy races, or sleeping 
until well after 3 p.m. Drinking is 
also part of that culture, whether or 
not the students involved are of age 
to drink.
However, the blow-out mentality 
of Carnival is complex; Carnival cul-
ture stems from a variety of factors. 
Firstly, we’re college students. As a 
demographic, we like to do poten-
tially stupid things, and more impor-
tantly, we like to try to outdo each 
other in how crazy we can get. Car-
nival is one of the few times in the 
school year when students can relax 
and blow off all the steam that’s been 
building since the beginning of the 
school year. With a school that’s as 
stressful as Carnegie Mellon, that’s a 
lot of steam.
If we want to reduce the amount 
of craziness that goes on during Car-
nival, events like Carnival need to 
happen more often. This theory may 
seem counterintuitive, but it’s not. In 
any pressurized situation, the single 
escape valve — Carnival, in this case 
— is going to see a lot of traf?c. The 
solution is not to let off less steam, 
but to create more holes for steam to 
escape through.
Carnival is not too unruly, espe-
cially given that events on the scale 
of Carnival only happen once a year. 
Yes, Carnegie Mellon students go a 
little crazy, but our antics could get 
much, much worse. Furthermore, 
Carnegie Mellon undergraduates 
tend to be between the ages of 18 
and 22 — the time in life to create 
the completely insane weekend sto-
ries that we’ll be telling when we’re 
40. If you’re going to have weekends 
when you forget all your responsibil-
ities and do whatever you want, now 
is the time.
While alumni and faculty are 
present with their families, little kids 
and all, they know what Carnival is 
like. Some parts — like the Wiggle 
Wurm and Granny Bugs rides, or 
some of the games in the booths — 
are very family friendly. However, 
while Carnegie Mellon is a giant 
nerd herd some days, it’s still a col-
lege campus, and Carnival is the last 
extended weekend before ?nals. 
Things are guaranteed to get a little 
crazy, and I think that’s a good thing.
With that mentality in mind, per-
sonal health and safety are still im-
portant. Carnival can be a blast, but 
remember you only have one liver.

Almost everything about the way 
we do taxes in this country is wrong. 
Taking for granted that it’s bene?cial 
for our society to force people to pay 
money for collective services, the 
way we pay for those services can, 
and should, be done much better 
than it is now. 
I don’t claim to have any answers 
to this issue, but I aim to point out a 
few problems in our current system 
and to encourage others to think out-
side of the box about ways that we 
— as a society — can make taxation 
more ef?cient.
First off, you shouldn’t need to 
hire someone to do your taxes. You 
shouldn’t need a college — or even 
high school — degree to do your tax-
es. Taxes should be simple and trans-
parent. There shouldn’t be things like 
the alternative minimum tax that 
force more and more people into pay-
ing a higher rate as time progresses. 
There shouldn’t be special-interest 
loopholes. 
You shouldn’t need to ?ll out a ton 
of forms, and there shouldn’t be a 
massive bureaucracy created to pro-
cess and read these forms to make 
sure they’re done correctly. Everyone 
should be able to understand exactly 
what they’re paying in taxes and why 
they’re paying that rate.
Additionally, the government 
currently collects money in numer-
ous ways, including the corporate 
tax, income tax, and excise taxes, 
among others. The government 
should have only one or two ways to 
collect revenue in order to be simple 
and transparent so that everyone 
knows exactly why and how their 
money is taken from them.
On that note, taxing a person’s 
income and effectively taxing pro-
duction is not bene?cial for society, 
and is therefore not the way in which 
the government should collect taxes. 
Every economist will tell you that  
when you tax something or make it 
more expensive, there is less of it pro-
duced. We should never discourage 
production in any way; production 
is the most important thing that our 
economy does. The sign of a healthy 
economy is a growing gross domestic 
product (GDP) with lots of money in 
motion. Taxing production stops that 
from happening.
I’m obviously not the ?rst per-
son who has thought about this, 
and many people have proposed 
alternatives. 
My favorite is the FairTax. This 
system taxes consumption instead 
of production, collects revenue one 
way, and is ridiculously simple.
The FairTax eliminates all cur-
rent taxes and instead levies a 23 
percent sales tax, according to 
fairtax.org. Then, at the beginning of 
each month, every American house-
hold gets a check in the mail for the 
amount of taxes they would pay up to 
the poverty line. So if you make the 
poverty line, you pay no taxes. If you 
make twice the poverty line, you pay 
half the 23 percent rate. This keeps 
the system progressive and fair.
People have proposed optional 
?at tax rates, taxation of just estates, 
and all number of revenue-gathering 
tactics. Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) cam-
paigned on the idea of being able to 
?ll out your taxes on an index card. 
Taxation should be reformed, and 
we as a country deserve better than 
what we have now in the realm of 
taxation.
Kyle Henson (kahenson@) is a staff-
writer for The Tartan.
Let’s re-evaluate the way that the United States does taxes

day night around 10. 5 a.m. 
always shows up a lot earlier 
than it seems like it will.”
In the spring there are 
regular build sessions, as 
well as push practices every 
night at 11 p.m. in addition 
to weekend rolls. 
Generally the team has 
enough drivers that each 
driver only needs to come out 
two or three times during the 
week instead of all ?ve days. 
“I’m not sure my shoulders 
could handle it otherwise,” 
Peterkin said.
As one of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s most experienced buggy 
drivers, she takes “pride in 
teaching our new drivers and 
mechanics, so the buggy tra-
dition can carry on,” she said.
“She’s been an incred-
ible resource for the younger 
drivers,” Monteleone said. “A 
bunch of drivers have come 
and gone, but Becky has 
stayed with us. She teaches 
them a lot, and really is a 
mentor.”
Fringe driver ?rst-year 
Gillian Rosen agreed. “Becky 
brings the wisdom and expe-
rience of ?ve years of driving 
and an excellent line,” she 
said. “Plus a laser pointer 
and a cozy bathrobe for cold 
mornings.”
“Becky makes all of the 
drivers feel very comfortable 
with who they are,” Mon-
teleone said. “She is a good 
friend to all the drivers.”
Peterkin’s favorite part 
of the Sweepstakes experi-
ence is the team that she is so 
dedicated to. “Even though it 
sounds corny, I’m just super 
grateful for a group of friends 
that I would have never had 
otherwise,” she said.
The team often “gets to-
gether for food, enjoying 
each other’s company.” The 
day before the big buggy 
race, the Fringe squad holds 
a big pasta party, watches old 
race footage, and decorates 
old uniforms. “It’s a blast,” 
Peterkin said.
Although Peterkin is un-
sure of what the future holds 
in terms of a career, she is 
looking for jobs and is sure 
that “if I ?nd something in 
Pittsburgh, there’s a very 
good chance I’ll come back 
[to Fringe] as an alumni.”
Although last weekend 
was the ?nal Sweepstakes of 
Peterkin’s career, her legacy 
is “one of record-breaking 
speed and victory,” Rosen 
said. Peterkin drove for both 
the women’s and men’s 
Fringe C teams, achieving a 
?nal time of 2:25.585 for the 
men and 3:11.434 in the pre-
liminaries for the women.
Peterkin would love “for 
buggy in general to continue 
its recent trend of growing, 
both in the numbers of teams 
involved and the amount of 
people truly committed to 
making rolls happen each 
year.” 
In addition, the die-hard 
“Frinja” would “like to see 
the team continue excelling 
in the design competition, 
and for Fringe to return to 
top speeds,” she said. “And of 
course, I’d like to see ‘Fringe’ 
written on the driver-sized 
?rst-place trophy a few more 
times.”

The men’s and women’s 
track and ?eld teams re-
cently had three major meets 
in preparation for the UAA 
Championships hosted by 
New York University on April 
27 and 28: the Dave Labor In-
vitational at Slippery Rock for 
throwers, jumpers, and sprint-
ers on April 13, the Outdoor 
Classic at Bucknell University 
on the April 13, and the Al-
legheny College Tri-Meet on 
the April 16. 
The men’s team had a 
mixed day in bad weather 
at Slippery Rock. The mid-
distance side excelled, with 
sophomore Tommy Vanden-
berg winning the 400-meter 
dash with a time of 48.78, 
?rst-year Thomas Mayo-
Smith placing second in the 
800, and the 4x400 relay 
team of Mayo-Smith, ?rst-
year Marc-Daniel Julien, 
Vandenberg, and sophomore 
Douglas O’Connell earning 
second place. Junior Zachary 
Erra-Hernandez, continuing 
an extremely strong season, 
won shot put and placed third 
in the hammer and discus 
events.
Injured ?rst-year standout 
Benjamin Neiman said the 
team “had a surprising num-
ber of strong performances 
despite really bad weather.”
Senior thrower Liam Mc-
Grath had a less optimistic 
view on the meet, admitting, 
“It was honestly a mediocre 
day.… I don’t think anyone 
had a great day, but I don’t 
think anyone had a particu-
larly bad day either.” Still, 
McGrath and Neiman both 
praised Hernandez’s perfor-
mance in the shot put.
On the women’s side, ju-
nior Jane Kim received a 
personal record with her 
sixth-place 35.52-meter per-
formance in the hammer 
throw. In the 5,000-meter 
run, sophomore Sara Kelly 
placed fourth and ?rst-year 
Sophia Greene ?nished sev-
enth. Junior Jacqueline Guev-
el won the 400-meter hurdles, 
and ?rst-year Alex Lewis won 
the 400-meter dash, with 
times of 64:91 and 62:13, re-
spectively. First-year Jenna 
Asperslag won the 100-meter 
dash with a personal record 
of 13.03, and fellow ?rst-year 
Erin Persson claimed third in 
the 1,500-meter event.
“The weather was miser-
able, but we collectively did 
well,” Asperslag said. “There 
were a lot of people who had 
personal records.” 
Greene agreed, saying, 
“despite the cold weather and 
the winds, we performed ad-
mirably.”
At Bucknell, sophomore 
Josh Newby seized sixth in 
the ?ve-kilometer event with 
a personal record of 14:41.43. 
From the women, senior Em-
ily Wobb captured 12th in the 
5,000-meter at 17:52.27, join-
ing sophomores Halley Bayer 
and Erin Kiekhaefer with per-
sonal records.
Men’s team senior captain, 
Dan Cardenas, said of the 
Bucknell meet, “The distance 
team did really well at Buck-
nell,” adding, “Josh Newby es-
pecially had a very good day.”
Both the men’s and wom-
en’s squads captured second 
place out of three teams at Al-
legheny. In the javelin throw, 
junior Dave Markowitz placed 
second. “Dave Markowitz, 
who throws javelin, has been 
close to hitting 50 meters in 
the past three meets, which 
is a big milestone,” McGrath 
said.
Erra-Hernandez set a per-
sonal record of 51.25 meters 
in the hammer throw, win-
ning the event. The Tartans 
swept the hammer toss, as 
junior Nathan Cheek won 
second and senior Pat Rob-
inson received third. Erra-
Hernandez also won the 
shot put and earned 
second in the discus 
throw.
First-year Brandon Hoane 
received a career-best 11.90 
meters with a fourth-place 
showing in the triple jump. 
Julien won second in the 
1,500, with a time of 4:09.01.
Mayo-Smith won the 800 
with a personal record of 
1:57.90 and senior Noel Titus 
received second places in both 
the 100-meter and 200-meter 
events, with a personal record 
of 10.96 seconds in the 100. 
Cardenas celebrated Titus’ 
performance, saying, “Noel 
Titus ?nally broke 11 seconds 
in the 100, which was his col-
lege goal.”
The women’s team saw a 
win in the triple jump and a 
second place in the long jump 
from junior Marissa Bynoe. 
Kim won the shot put, and se-
nior Carissa Iannone placed 
?rst in the javelin, throwing 
32.81 meters. Fellow senior 
Leila Bouabdellaoui won the 
3,000-meter steeplechase 
with a personal record of 
11:58.85, and Asperslag won 
the 200-meter dash and got 
second place in the 100-me-
ter. First-years Taylor Mag-
giacomo and Elizabeth 
Snyder ?nished second 
and third respectively 
in the 1500-meter 
run. Junior Marie 
Barcic placed 
second in the 
800-meter 
run, and was 
joined by 
Persson at 
third.
Asperslag said, “Allegh-
eny was a much smaller meet 
[than other meets this year] 
... pretty much everyone did 
well.”
The team has UAA Champi-
onships this coming weekend. 
Neiman said, “I don’t think we 
really need to improve,” con-
tinuing, “We have the talent  
... now we just need to go out 
and do well.”
Summarizing the season as 
a whole, Cardenas said, “we 
started out pretty slow but 
we’ve gotten much better.... 
This is probably the best year 
in program history, and there 
have been more records than 
there have been for over 25 
years.”

performances too much, 
though, as there were still 
several excellent times put in. 
The SDC men’s A team won 
with a time of 2:04.987, only 
about 1.5 seconds behind the 
all-time record of 2:03.30 
that SDC set in 2009. Sigma 
Phi Epsilon (SigEp) A and 
Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) A — 
who placed second and third, 
respectively, in the men’s 
race — also did well, both 
performing incredibly close to 
last year’s times.
As in the preliminaries, 
there was only one crash: Sig-
ma Nu A’s buggy, nicknamed 
Bungarus Krait, spun out of 
control around a curve in the 
chute and crashed into the 
hay bales lining the course’s 
edge.
Since all 28 of the men’s 
teams had to compete on Sat-
urday, it took far more time 
than originally scheduled to 
complete the men’s ?nals. 
Sweepstakes committee thus 
announced around 11 a.m. 
that the women’s ?nals would 
be canceled, making the 
scores from the preliminary 
race the ?nal scores.
However, soon after, the 
commitee rescinded its deci-
sion and announced it would 
be holding the ?nal races after 
all, causing the buggy teams 
to frantically reorganize for 
the races. Buggy participants 
down by the trucks had mixed 
emotions; some sprung into 
action, while others protested 
the change. “I just ate,” one 
pusher bemoaned when she 
heard the news.
“We were ready to pack 
things and be done, so no 
one’s prepared to unload the 
buggies and get the wheels 
heated, and we don’t know 
where all our pushers are,” 
said senior Ben Pattison-
Gordon, a pusher for the CIA 
B team. 
“They all dispersed be-
cause they thought they were 
done,” said Jessica Phoa, a 
sophomore pusher for CIA 
women’s B team. However, 
as Pattison-Gordon noted, it 
was also understandable that 
some seniors wanted to get 
their last pushes in.
Had the scores from the 
preliminaries stood as the ?-
nal scores, SDC A still would 
have come in ?rst place at 
2:32.062, with CIA A and SDC 
B behind them. But the last-
minute change did not hurt 
SDC: In its ?nal heat, SDC A 
got a time of 2:32.600. In the 
?nals, Fringe B ended up com-
ing in second, at 2:39.004.
Junior Taryn Monteleone, 
Fringe president and pusher 
on hill two for the Fringe B 
team, said she was “satis?ed” 
with Fringe’s overall perfor-
mance. “We had a brand new 
team of people in charge,” 
she said. “Overall, as a team, 
I think we grew a lot.”

Students, alumni, and 
parents crowded the sides of 
Tech and Frew Streets last 
Friday and Saturday to watch 
the 94th annual Sweepstakes 
competition — or Buggy, as 
it is better known within the 
Carnegie Mellon community. 
The Student Dormitory Coun-
cil (SDC) came out on top 
once again in both the men’s 
and women’s races, with its A 
teams winning both races by 
about a four-second margin. 
This is the third year in a row 
that SDC won the women’s 
race, and the second year in a 
row that it has won the men’s 
race.
Eleven organizations com-
peted in the race around the 
0.9-mile course this year. In 
addition to long-established 
buggy organizations like 
Sigma Alpha Epsilon (SAE), 
which has participated in 
Buggy off and on since the 
1920s, there were two newer 
additions to the competition: 
Apex, which raced for the ?rst 
time in 2012, and Reserve Of-
?cers’ Training Corps (ROTC). 
Although the Air Force ROTC  
competed in Buggy from 
1987–90, this is the ?rst year 
that Carnegie Mellon’s Naval 
ROTC has competed.
Friday’s preliminary races 
were cut short because of rain, 
but not before the 19 women’s 
teams held their preliminar-
ies. SDC A gave a hint of what 
was to come in the next day’s 
races, ?nishing the women’s 
preliminary a full 10 seconds 
faster than the next closest 
team, CIA A. Fringe A would 
have come in second place 
behind SDC A, had they not 
been disquali?ed for safety 
violations. There were only 
four heats on the men’s side 
before rain forced the pre-
liminaries to end, but SPIRIT 
A took the lead in races that 
were completed, with a time 
of 2:13.408. Of the races that 
did occur, there was one mis-
hap — in a heat against ROTC 
A and Fringe B (who failed to 
show), SDC D was in the lead 
until the buggy spun out while 
going around a curve. SDC C 
and Fringe B were given a 
second chance, though, as all 
28 men’s teams were resched-
uled to race on Saturday be-
cause of the rain.
Although Saturday morn-
ing was windy and cold, there 
was no rain, allowing the 
races to proceed. This was 
the ?rst time in several years 
that Buggy held a full second 
day of races, as the ?nal races 
were cut short due to rain in 
both 2011 and 2012.
As one of the WRCT 
commentators noted, the 
buggies tend to go slower in 
cold weather since it makes 
the roads colder. This did 
not seem to affect the teams’

ABBY SMITH
Staffwriter
Fifth-year architecture 
student Becky Peterkin 
surely knows how to let the 
good times roll. As a buggy 
driver for Fringe for all ?ve 
of her years here at Carnegie 
Mellon, the King George, 
Va. native has gotten to both 
design and drive record-
setting buggies.
Peterkin has devoted 
much of her college career 
to Fringe’s buggy team, both 
driving and building their 
buggies. Although she hasn’t 
participated much this past 
year due to time restraints 
and developing allergies to a 
few raw materials, she was a 
mechanic during her sopho-
more and junior years. “I 
didn’t do too much in the way 
of hard machining, but I like 
to think I was helpful as an 
extra person who could put 
on and take off the wheels 
and know how to do some-
what complicated wraps in 
the build process,” she said.
Peterkin drove and helped 
build Fringe’s buggy Bonsai, 
which won second place in 
the buggy design competition 
in 2011. For Peterkin, Bonsai 
was her biggest accomplish-
ment: “I’m very proud of hav-
ing a large role in building 
Bonsai and then getting to 
drive her to a record-setting 
freeroll.” Bonsai was the ?rst 
buggy to do a sub-50-second 
freeroll.
“Becky is most certainly 
one of our best drivers and 
really was a force to be reck-
oned with when she drove 
Bonsai,” said Fringe president 
junior Taryn Monteleone.
Peterkin’s ability to be an 
active member of a buggy 
team has exceeded all of her 
pre-college expectations. Al-
though she had heard a bit 
about the sport and knew 
that shorter girls usually got 
to drive the buggies, there 
were still many unknowns 
about the tradition. “Coming 
to CMU, I knew almost noth-
ing about Buggy. I remember 
being nervous about ?nding 
frat guys I could actually talk 
to about driving. I didn’t even 
know that there were inde-
pendent teams until I was 
recruited onto one,” Peter-
kin said. “I just knew it was a 
sport where being short was 
not only helpful, but let you 
get the most fun job.”
After she joined the team, 
Peterkin quickly caught the 
bug for buggy, and has been 
heavily involved ever since, 
adopting the daily schedule 
of a hardcore buggy driver.
In the ?rst few weeks of 
the fall, before rolls actu-
ally start, Peterkin goes to 
recruitment events, particu-
larly when the Fringe team 
is looking for a new driver, 
which involves “a few weeks 
of Thursday night half-price 
visits and other organized 
things to ?nd new Frinjas,” 
she said. As for her regular 
weekly schedule, “The main 
day-to-day differences are 
of course actual rolls, but 
that does have some impact 
on the rest of the week,” she 
said. “I usually go to bed Fri-

Mixed reviews for Sweet Jesus!
Dietz presents concert reading of original musical
Among Spring Carnival’s attractions this year was 
a chance to catch an early glimpse at Sweet Jesus!, 
a new musical with music and lyrics by senior 
music composition major Eric Dietz, in the form of a 
concert reading. The script was written by Carnegie 
Mellon alumna Shannon Deep (BHA ’10, HNZ ’11) 
and Dietz’s score was orchestrated by Matt Aument 
(CFA ’10).
Naming a musical Sweet Jesus! might raise a few 
eyebrows, but the title is quickly put in context. 
The play is about a Broadway musical of the same 
name — following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ 
Superstar or Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor 
Dreamcoat — that an eccentric writer is trying 
to get investors interested in by way of a staged 
reading.
A staged reading has the actors read their lines 
aloud, with their scripts in front of them and without 
the choreography they would perform in an actual 
production. The stage directions are narrated, 
usually by the director or writer of the work. Because 
one of these readings forms the backdrop for most of 
the story’s action, the performance was essentially a 
staged reading about a staged reading — but with 
full musical accompaniment. This was either fitting 
for the nature of a the show or somewhat confusing, 
depending on whom you ask.
At one point, the actual reader of the stage 
directions described how the fictional reader 
of stage directions read the stage directions. 
Fortunately, junior vocal performance major Nigel 
Rowe imbued the writer Steffen St. Ray with 
clear rapture for the sound of his own voice as 
he described lavishly overwrought scenery and 
sacrilegious interpretations of events; he describes 
Roman soliders coming to take Jesus away wearing 
’60s business suits and riding Vespas.
In fact, the entire cast gave performances that did 
not disappoint. Even members of the ensemble 
managed to display more than a little character, at 
least to the eyes of this untrained reviewer. When 
duplicitous lover Tyler (played by junior acting 
major Michael Campayno), who plays Jesus in the 
fictitious show, pulls out a ray gun and zaps the 
rest of the company, one of the ensemble members 
(played by sophomore vocal performance major 
Ethan Crystal) threw down his binder and stormed 
off stage, seemingly going off script on two levels.
However, the main plot, which has little to do with 
the premise of a terrible Jesus musical, is not quite 
as compelling the actor’s performances. The plot 
winds up as a bit of a flimsy excuse for a set of 
songs that are great for the most part. It’s pretty 
clear that the musical serves as a sort of love letter 
to the world of young people struggling to make it 
on Broadway; the last number, “New York,” couldn’t 
have made this any clearer if it required the whole 
cast to don “I Heart NY” shirts. There’s a clear 
longing for the trials and tribulations experienced by 
the protagonist John (portrayed by senior musical 
theatre major Trevor McQueen).
Despite making several references to Disney — and 
avoiding the endings associated with that name 
— this love letter can feel a bit like a form letter. 
The main plot lacks surprises and the characters all 
develop along expected lines. A lucky (literal) break 
gives the young country boy a shot at success; his 
lover turns out to be a cheating jerk; the roommate 
and his friend from home have the country boy’s 
back; and he manages to reconcile with his mother, 
who is unable to accept his homosexuality.
Honestly, the most surprising thing is the how little 
attention the women get. Gillian Hassert (CFA ’12) 
sings to McQueen while portraying his mother, but 
the song is still male-centric: It’s about her devotion 
to her son. The only other exclusively female song 
is “When You’re a Hag,” which bemoans the 
inability of John’s high school friend Annie (played 
by junior voice major Chloe Holgate) to find a 
straight man interested in dating her. Beyond the 
social issues involved in these choices, there’s the 
structural problem of the female characters having 
nothing interesting to do but offer moral support 
for the protagonist despite having a diverse set of 
personalities.
As a final note, the music was well executed and 
fun.

Advice for awkward people
Dear Patrick,
Oh God, oh God, I’m so 
hung over. The light is 
blinding, and all the noise 
hurts. I feel like someone 
is trying unscrew my 
skull. What have I done to 
deserve this? WHAT HAS 
GOD WROUGHT!?!? How 
can I lessen this pain?
Thanks,
Ow! Hangover, Gosh, 
Ow, Drinks Torture, 
Hangover Everlasting, 
Please Answer, Imbibing 
Nonetheless
Dear OH GOD THE PAIN,
This is the problem with only 
going out during Carnival. 
You don’t build up your 
tolerance enough all year for 
last week’s extravaganza. 
Those of us who go out 
multiple times a week 
are used to that feeling. I 
don’t even notice the pain 
anymore; it’s just the usual 
morning feeling. But for 
those of you who don’t want 
to feel awful all day, here are 
some recovery techniques.
First of all, you need to go 
back in time. When you’re 
still drunk, drink a lot of 
water. Then, go to bed for 
the next 18 hours. If you’ve 
woken up the next day and 
still feel awful, your first goal 
should be to drink some 
water. Really, water and pain 
medication are your only 
options. My father always 
recommended the three 
S’s: showering, shaving, 
and going to the bathroom. 
If that doesn’t do it for you 
then I don’t know what will.
Or just have another 
drink,
Patrick Hoskins
Dear Patrick,
I’m throwing a party this 
weekend, my friend’s dad 
is in town, and I hear he’s 
really cool. Should I invite 
him? I feel like it could 
only make things better. 
What could go wrong with 
inviting a 50-year-old guy 
to my party?
Thanks,
Forget This, I Gotta Go To 
My Last Carnival Party
Dear FTIGGTMLCP,
That’s a great idea! Partying 
with the previous generation 
is always a good time. If they 
want to go out to bars, they 
have jobs and are always 
willing to pick up the tab. 
If it’s a house party, then 
he’s willing to go to a house 
party. I’m barely willing to go 
to house parties! If you can 
take a shot of bottom-shelf 
vodka with the man, then 
he’s the kind of man I want 
to be when I grow up.
The one problem with 
inviting him is if he has too 
much game. Obviously, 
when he shows up he’s 
gonna get a lot of attention, 
’cause he’s got 30 years 
on the other guests. After 
that, he can just play up the 
charm. He has 30 years’ 
worth more stories than you, 
and 30 years’ worth more 
experience with women. You 
can’t compete with him. A 
full head of hair will only get 
you so far.
Plus, there are a lot of 
college-age gold diggers,
Patrick Hoskins

Do you sometimes feel low? Unsatis?ed? Lost? Like 
you’re just another nobody, stranded, alone in the 
universe? Then just pick up a gun and shoot the 
President! That’s the advice given by both failed and 
successful presidential killers that make up the cast 
of characters in Scotch’n’Soda’s 75th anniversary 
production of Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman’s 
Assassins, which was presented throughout last week’s 
Spring Carnival in Rangos Hall.
The musical follows a rogue’s gallery of American 
assassins, including John Wilkes Booth (who killed 
Abraham Lincoln), Leon Czolgosz (William McKinley’s 
killer), and Charles Guiteau (who killed James Gar?eld), 
as they debate, hatch, and execute their plans to 
kill the President of the United States — sometimes 
successfully, sometimes not so much.
Assassins is comprised of numerous and somewhat 
independent stories, each involving one of the assassins 
trying to solve his or her problems by killing the 
most important man in America. These characters 
hang around a carnival-style shooting game run by 
the encouraging Proprietor, played by sophomore 
vocal performance major Kevin O’Hora. Each story is 
accompanied by a song sung directly to the audience 
by the Balladeer, played by junior mathematics major 
William Veer. The songs provided the reasons for each 
assassin’s crime and challenged them at the same time.
The stories range in energy and tone from incredibly 
funny and active to more somber and downbeat. 
Watching junior communication design major Larissa 
Jantonio’s Lynette “Squeaky” Fromme and sophomore 
vocal performance major Joanna Latini’s Sara Jane 
Moore bumble through their attempted assassination of 
President Gerald Ford kept the audience in stitches.
Jantonio perfectly captured the kind of manic intensity 
one would expect from a member of the infamous 
murderers of the Manson family. Her frequent explosions 
of love and admiration for her crazed leader Charles 
Manson were so over the top, yet sincere, you didn’t 
know whether to laugh or shift uncomfortably in your 
seat.
Latini perfectly complemented Jantonio’s focused energy 
with her portrayal of an average housewife who just 
can’t get the whole assassination thing down; one scene 
involving her inability to shoot her gun was particularly 
memorable. Her performance was fully committed and 
hilarious, allowing every one of their scenes to play 
extraordinarily well.
On the ?ip side, junior vocal performance major James 
Alexander’s Leon Czolgosz is haunted by the gruesome 
sights he witnesses at his job in a turn-of-the-century 
factory. Czolgosz debates whether or not he is capable 
of killing President McKinley so that he can put an 
end to the injustice perpetrated against the common 
worker. Many of Czolgosz’s scenes involved a darkened 
stage with him in the spotlight, which highlighted the 
alienation he feels as just another cog in the machine.
While Assassins is a good musical, its lack of focus 
makes its message feel a little bit muddled. The script 
attempts to make grand statements about the death 
of the American dream and identi?es the idea as the 
driving force behind each character’s actions, but it 
instead comes across as a discontinuous jumble of ideas.
Assassins is at its most engaging, however, when 
it delves into the more personal reasons for the 
assassinations. Sophomore vocal performance major 
Taylor Rawley’s John Hinckley is deeply in love with 
Jodie Foster and feels that by making a grand statement 
— attempting to kill President Ronald Reagan — he 
will win her love. While this dream is obviously crazy, 
Rawley’s performance almost made you want it to come 
true, and Hinckley’s failure was near heartbreaking.
This desire to matter to someone — anyone — was 
shared by many of the other assassins, notably Fromme. 
Fromme sings a song with Hinckley in which they 
express feeling unworthy of another’s love (in her case, 
the love of Charles Manson). When you get to the 
heart of each character’s story, they’re all pretty much 
about a desire to be important, and the moments that 
demonstrate that wish are where Assassins really hits 
home.
Even though it has been in production and planning for 
months, given the recent events in Boston, Assassins 
felt incredibly relevant. The musical makes note that, at 
the end of the day, the killing of each of these Presidents 
did nothing to ?x the ills the assassins saw in America. 
While it is a bit cliché to say that violence is never the 
answer, the sentiment is nonetheless true.
Whether it be the murder of innocent civilians or a 
dramatic assassination of a global leader, killing any 
member of a society can’t ?x that society’s faults. The 
images on every television screen of the chaos and 
violence in Boston must have been in the back of many 
audience members’ minds while watching Assassins; 
they de?nitely were in mine. This timeliness made the 
musical much more powerful than it would have if it had 
been performed just a week earlier.

Friedlander sports black-belt comedic skills
30 Rock comedian and “World Champion” discusses presidential platform, karate book
The weather was warm, everyone was happy, and laughs 
were ?owing freely last Thursday during “Comedy 
Central on Campus,” a show presented by AB Comedy.
The cast of the show was the true de?nition of triple 
threat: Judah Friedlander, Nick Vatterott, and Jermaine 
Fowler. They performed for a crowd under the standing-
room-only white tent on Midway.
Fowler is a familiar face to those who frequent the 
comedy website CollegeHumor. Fowler opened the 
show with a short, 20-minute bit. His routine was not 
as impressive or as polished as those of the other two; it 
seemed to be just vaguely strung together.
While that strategy worked later for Friedlander, who 
went from one one-liner to the next during the ?rst 
part of his performance, Fowler couldn’t pull it off. 
Admittedly, he’s younger and less experienced, but it 
seemed as if he were trying a style of performance that 
he wasn’t used to. He left the stage after a ?ve-minute 
blast of jokes that was energetic but random and handed 
the show over to Vatterott.
Vatterott’s work up to this point has primarily included 
writing gigs and making guest appearances on Conan, 
Late Night with Jimmy Fallon, and the Comedy Central 
show Mash Up. Vatterott’s routine was perhaps the most 
entertaining; it was well timed, quick witted, and right 
on par with the crowd’s appetite for comedy.
Fowler then returned to the stage to introduce 
Friedlander. The headliner of the show, Friedlander is 
perhaps the best known of the three due to his role on 
the popular NBC comedy show 30 Rock, which just 
ended in January. His character on the show, Frank 
Rossitano, is very similar to the one that he portrays 
during his stand-up comedy routines: a sloppy, hat-
obsessed deadpan humorist who exaggerates stories 
about himself.
Friedlander’s routine centered on the premise that as 
“World Champion,” he was going to run for President of 
the United States. He walked the audience through a 
hilarious rundown of his platform, and then invited the 
audience to ask questions.
Friedlander’s quick and witty responses to the questions 
demonstrated his amazing ability to think on his feet 
and work with the crowd. Even as the audience threw 
curveballs such as questions about Tina Fey, Iraq, and 
— perhaps most eloquent moment of the evening — his 
genitals, Friedlander stayed one step ahead and kept the 
audience laughing at the outlandishness of his larger-
than-life character. His quirky, weird sense of humor was 
so absurd that there was nothing to do but enjoy the 
ride.
The comedian took the majority of the time to discuss 
his simpli?ed plans for taking over the world, which 
involved moving the Midwest to north of Canada, using 
karate skills to intimidate America’s enemies, and 
legalizing heroin to make legalizing marijuana easier. 
He advertised his nonexistent karate instruction book, 
which, according to his performance, solves just about 
any problem and makes anyone physically stronger.
Friedlander not only invited questions and responded 
to them, but also picked people out of the audience 
and adapted the routine to the personalities of his 
listeners. He invited photographers up on stage, 
questioned boys about the girls that they were sitting 
next to, and made fun of the majors that people called 
out.
All three of the performers personalized the show for 
Pittsburgh and Carnegie Mellon, citing the campus food, 
hipster environments, and robotics department. The 
audience was receptive and excited, which seemed to 
make the show all the more fun.
When it comes down to it, you know a show is funny 
when a comedian is laughing at it, and that’s exactly 
what happened. As Vatterott and Friedlander performed, 
Fowler stood on the side with a bottle of water and 
enjoyed the show with everyone else. His signature 
cackle at his fellow comedians’ best jokes was possibly 
the highlight of the show. The show was as great as 
the weather that night and was a great start to Carnival 
2013.

A line of people wound all the way to the parking garage 
last Friday evening at 7 p.m. for an 8 p.m. concert in 
Wiegand Gymnasium. If it were any other artist, the 
anticipation would probably not be nearly as intense, 
with people literally ?ghting to get into the gymnasium. 
The chanting from the crowd ensured that the entire 
Carnegie Mellon campus was aware that Lupe Fiasco 
was in Pittsburgh to perform at Carnegie Mellon’s Spring 
Carnival.
The concert was a success in terms of the anticipation 
before, excitement during, and craze after the event. 
In terms of organization, however, the event was a bit 
chaotic. According to AB Concerts co-chair Rebecca 
Paren, 2,000 tickets were released, but only 1,500 people 
were allowed in, which meant that some people with 
reserved tickets were denied admission to the concert. 
This was especially troubling because there seemed to 
be extra space in the back of the gym that could have 
allowed more people with tickets to attend the concert.
Perhaps everything would have run more smoothly had 
the show been held outdoors as originally planned. The 
weather ended up staying dry on Friday evening, though 
AB Concerts had decided to move the concert inside 
earlier in the week.
Though the concert began at 8 p.m., two DJs opened 
for Lupe and the audience grew very anxious for the 
headliner’s appearance. Every ?ve minutes, there would 
be a literal “Kick Push” as people shoved toward the 
stage. Many students were also trying to cut the line in 
order to get to the front, causing even more of a frenzy. 
The beginning of the concert can only be characterized 
as out of control.
Surprisingly, Lupe Fiasco’s appearance calmed the 
crowd rather than sending them into a frenzy. Once his 
?rst song began, the audience’s hands went into the 
air, and Lupe sang and rapped for 10 minutes without 
a break. The singer’s passion was evident through his 
every move and his lyrics. Lupe might be a man of 
relatively few words, but he sang so closely to students, 
making eye contact and almost touching the audience, 
that he was de?nitely fully engaged with his fans. He 
even splashed water at the audience, further exciting 
the crowd.
Without any intermission or even a breather, the 
concert continued until around 10 p.m. Unlike the 
beginning, when everyone was ?ghting to be at the 
front, the second half saw people at the front begin 
trying to move back to get a breather, allowing audience 
members at the back of the gym to move up. Although 
it was unintentional, everyone had a fair chance to be 
near the performer they had been waiting to see, and 
“Daydreamin’ ” of, after all.
Finally, an encore of “The Show Goes On” — Lupe’s 
most popular and best-known song — served as the 
conclusion to the exciting evening. Everyone slowly left 
the University Center, singing the songs from the show. 
Logistical issues aside, the concert was an enjoyable 
event by a passionate artist, and will serve as one of the 
highlights of Carnival 2013.

McConomy Auditorium saw an in?ux of ?lm lovers, 
friends of ?lmmakers, and casual observers on Saturday 
night as part of the SHOT FOR SHOT Student Film 
Festival. Like the Carnegie Mellon International Film 
Festival, which ended two weekends ago, this ?lm 
festival is yet another effort to draw the campus’ 
attention to the world of ?lmmaking.
But this year, the festival organizers decided to try 
something different. This year was the ?rst time that 
the Carnegie Mellon Film Club opened the festival to 
submissions from across Pittsburgh. Films came from six 
schools in total, and the screened ?lms included work 
by students at Carnegie Mellon, Point Park University, 
and the University of Pittsburgh — often in collaboration 
with students at other schools.
The result was a rich and impressive display of 
Pittsburgh student ?lmmaking talent — a sparkling 
achievement of a ?lm festival. As Carnegie Mellon Film 
Club co-president and senior directing major Stephen 
Tonti said in his introduction to the festival, “We 
really are promoting intercollegiate ?lmmaking.” And 
according to Tonti, the quality of the submissions “goes 
to show how much artistic creativity is actually in this 
city.”
The ?lms were fantastic and surprisingly high in quality, 
considering that they were put together by students. 
Most of the ?lms were 10–13 minutes in length, although 
there were a few two- or three-minute ?lms that were 
almost too short to process.
The festival opened with a fabulously amusing piece 
called The Big Fold by Bailey Donovan of Point Park 
University, which follows a young boy whose mother 
charges him with breaking his father’s poker trophy. 
We watched as the boy assumed the identity of his 
favorite crime-movie detective on a quest to prove his 
own innocence. The ?lm simultaneously pokes fun at 
the drama and serious dialogue of old black-and-white 
movies and at the childish fantasies we all have about 
our favorite heroes.
Other highlights included Hotel Romance by Corey 
Sweazen of Point Park University, which uses a clean 
aesthetic and surreal special effects to tell the story of 
a bizarre relationship between a man and a woman, 
the entirety of which takes place in a hotel. In a very 
different approach, Dominic Rodriguez’s non?ction 
Fursonas explores the unusual lifestyle of “fursuiters” 
— people who dress up in fur suits — through 
documentary-style interviews. And in typical coming-
of-age fashion, The Perils of Growing Up Flat-Chested 
by Carnegie Mellon alumna Yulin Kuang (DC ’12) follows 
a girl with body image issues who is determined to 
impress her science-project partner and crush.
Another audience favorite was Fade by Josh Lopata 
of Point Park University, an intricate and beautiful 
animation ?lm that explored the struggle of a young 
boy to cope with his father’s death. The rich animation 
— accomplished through puppetry and miniature 
set construction — took between one-and-a-half 
and two years of work, and the result proved to be 
spectacular. The ?lm represents death metaphorically 
as a threatening, black, shapeless monster that the boy 
literally grapples with throughout the movie. The ?nal 
scene — in which the monster ?nally takes the boy’s dad 
— sent a hushed sadness over the crowd that only lifted 
when the audience clapped wildly during the ending 
credits.
When the judges took the stage after the screening, each 
emphasized how genuinely dif?cult the decision was to 
pick only two winners among the ?lms. It was easy to 
see why: The ?lms were vastly diverse in their subject 
matter, aesthetic, and general approaches, and many 
of them were equally excellent in very different ways. 
Ultimately, The Big Fold won the Grand Jury Prize, while 
The Perils of Growing Up Flat-Chested won the Special 
Jury Prize. Meanwhile, Fade took the Audience Award, 
which was determined by audience members who 
passed up paper ballots marking their favorite ?lm of the 
evening.
The festival bene?ted greatly from welcoming 
submissions from schools all across Pittsburgh, 
and the result was a truly inspiring display of the 
excellence of Pittsburgh intercollegiate ?lmmaking. 
As Carnegie Mellon Film Club co-president and senior 
business administration major Nicolas Hurt said in his 
introduction to the festival, “This year, we wanted to do 
something much bigger.” They certainly pulled it off.

AB Films begins its sojourn into the legacy of 
Spaghetti Westerns with Django, Sergio Corbucci’s 
iconic tale. It’s unfortunate that we will only think 
of this as the predecessor to Quentin Tarantino’s 
newest joint, because there is a lot to love here 
and it really should be required viewing for fans of 
Tarantino’s rehash. This is a ?lm that spawned more 
sequels than pretty much anything else and refuses 
to be tamed. If you want to know why Tarantino 
seems as clever as he does, don’t miss this.
Django
Thursday, April 25

The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly
Saturday, April 27

The ultimate Spaghetti Western and Tarantino’s 
vote for greatest ?lm of all time. Sergio Leone 
masterfully pits three men against each other in an 
epic of radical proportions. There was nothing that 
could have prepared the world for this eruption in 
1966. It’s the role that de?ned Clint Eastwood. It’s 
the music that de?ned a genre. It’s the style that 
in?uenced a generation. The Good, the Bad, and 
the Ugly is not for the faint of heart, but it rewards 
any who dare to master it — a totally unique and 
visionary spin on the Western genre that has yet 
to be outdone.
Django Unchained
Friday, April 26
7 10 1
The newest joint from our favorite wise guy auteur. 
Quentin Tarantino mashes his two greatest obsessions 
together — Westerns and exploitation ?icks — to create 
this very complicated Frankenstein of a ?lm. Django is 
codi?ed as an exploitation ?ick, but functions as a type 
of revenge, a theme we have seen Tarantino explore 
before. Every corpse is ?lled with two or three times the 
normal amount of blood, and style is the substance. 
Leonardo DiCaprio and Christoph Waltz, perhaps the 
greatest speakers of Tarantenese to ever walk this 
Earth, perform valiantly in a picture that ultimately fails 
to become the kind of arresting moral behemoth that 
Inglourious Basterds was in 2010.

Throughout Carnival, as a self-designated, one-person 
committee, I went through every booth and selected 
the winners of several categories in what I call the 
“Boothy Awards.” This year’s booths, following the 
theme of “Fractured Fairytales,” again demonstrated 
the passion and dedication of Carnegie Mellon 
students. Without further ado, here is the ?rst edition of 
the Boothies.
The Hipster Boothy for Best Design
Kappa Alpha Theta’s “Enchanted Garden” wins 
best design — a result of its grand and successful 
ambitions. While the enlarged ?owers and dandelion 
puffs hanging on the evergreen exterior may have 
seemed over the top, they were consistent with the 
Thumbelina-inspired theme.
Inside, tour guides explained how the exaggerated 
sizes were the result of a spell that shrunk one’s body 
to the size of a thumb. If the outside showed that these 
women could think big, the interior displayed their 
ability to go small. A quaint lily pond was just one of 
many beautiful details in this enchanted forest. Papier-
mâché trees and magical stalactites also made this 
booth feel larger than life.
The Pong Boothy for Best Game
This Boothy goes to KGB’s “Funkelstiltskin”. In this 
booth’s game, one dropped plastic golf balls into holes 
that activated different notes of the “Smoke on the 
Water” theme. The simple goal was to recreate the 
tune. But this was harder than it sounds. KGB wins this 
Boothy for a game that was moderately dif?cult and 
also displayed technological prowess.
The Andy Warhol Boothy for Best Art
The Asian Students Association (ASA) always manages 
to impress during Carnival, and this year was no 
exception.
If Pixar chooses to go old school and hand-draw the 
animations for the Finding Nemo sequel, it would be wise 
to draw inspiration from ASA. The incredibly detailed 
paintings of the Finding Nemo and Little Mermaid 
characters in the booth seemed to have been taken 
straight from the big screen, and the papier-mâché 
creations of seagulls proved that ASA is no one-trick pony.
The Andrew Mellon Boothy for Most Underrated 
Booth
Making a booth isn’t easy, especially for organizations 
that lack the ?nancial resources and manpower of 
big fraternities and sororities. However, bigger is not 
necessarily better, as was made evident by SPIRIT’s 
“Pinocchio Story.”
This booth consisted of one room whose main feature 
was a comic strip that stretched across three walls. But 
it was a special comic — one that combined the stories 
of Pinocchio, Alice in Wonderland, and Toy Story. It was a 
delightful story that I didn’t have to wait on a line for.
KGB also deserves some recognition here. Half record 
store and half neon nightclub, its one-story booth 
combined the tale of Rumpelstiltskin with funk music. 
Though not all of the references were clear, KGB’s booth 
was very solid in terms of artwork and design.
The Judah Friedlander Boothy for Funniest Booth
Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpy Dumpty had a 
great fall and was rushed to the ICU.
Alpha Epsilon Pi’s “Humpty Dumpty Hospital” tells 
the part of the tale not included in the nursery rhyme. 
Although nobody could put Humpty together again, the 
men of Alpha Epsilon Pi reminded us that Humpty ?rst 
had to be saved in a game of Operation.
The Andrew Carnegie Boothy for Best Overall Booth
From the Midway entrance next to The Underground, 
Theta’s “Enchanted Garden” booth immediately set the 
standard for the rest of the booths. As tall as it was, the 
detail of the exterior was even more impressive. However, 
the best booth, in my opinion, was 20 yards away, where 
a cluster of colorful balloons ?oated above Sigma Phi 
Epsilon’s booth based on Pixar’s Up.
After visitors were greeted by a papIer-mâché caricature 
of the grumpy main character Carl, the inside of “SigUp” 
was truly delightful. On the ?rst ?oor, the wooden ?oor 
tiling and simple wallpaper brought the details of the 
Pixar movie to life.
Spring Carnival booths impress and entertain in a wide variety of categories
Fractured Fairytales theme produces diversity of original, funny, well-designed booths that interpret classic tales like “Thumbelina” and recent ?lms like Pixar’s Finding Nemo
Although this senior citizen’s home seemed very 
harmless, his journey was anything but. The interactive 
game inside the booth, in which the user steers through 
tumultuous clouds, serves as a reminder of the dif?cult 
journey his house went through.
The journey of the booth continues to the second ?oor, 
but not before a reconception of the movie’s waterfall 
scene next to the stairs. The top ?oor recreates the 
jungle setting of the ?lm with real plants and dense 
foliage. This ?oor even features Kevin, the ?amingo-like 
creature from the movie.
Though Kappa Alpha Theta’s was a close second, 
Sigma Phi Epsilon wins for its ?ne details and faithful 
representation of the beloved Pixar movie.
Conclusion
With that, we bring an end to this year’s Boothies. 
While it was a great year, not all booths made the cut — 
although this is not a re?ection of their quality.
For people not involved in building booths, it is very easy 
to walk through a booth and see nothing special. But the 
fact is that these booths are made by full-time Carnegie 
Mellon students — students who want nothing more 
than to display their love for Spring Carnival.

Derbies do not usually include nude people, unicorns, 
and King Kong. But that is because most derbies are not 
presented by the School of Art.
The fourth annual Anti-Gravity Downhill Derby was held 
on Thursday on the treacherous incline between Doherty 
Hall and the University Center. The derby is advertised 
as an alternative to the buggy races, as well as “the 
slowest race this side of the Mississippi.”
This description is somewhat misleading: The derby is 
not a race as much as it is a fashion show and parade 
slapped together in less than a week for the fun of it. In 
fact, many of the “buggies” did not end up working as 
expected, and some outright broke down.
Still, there were a number of funny and original carts that 
travelled down the Doherty incline, including Napoleon 
with a cannon that ?red smoke, a pair of Swedish chefs, 
Aladdin and Jasmine rolling in a carpet, Wall Street 
investors on skateboards throwing money around, 
Miracle Whip ?ghting mayonnaise, a boy scout and his 
model airplane, a royal lion, and one person in a worm 
costume trying to slowly crawl down the incline.
Some of the carts were particularly impressive — in 
particular, one of a man in a King Kong costume raging 
on top of the Empire State Building, which had another 
man in a pilot costume riding a moving airplane at the 
front. 
There were also a number of carts that were sea themed, 
including people dressed up as mermaids spitting 
water, a ?sh tank, a shark/penguin man, and Venus in 
a seashell in a representation of Botticelli’s The Birth 
of Venus. Plenty of food-themed carts, such as Oreo-
cookies-and-milk and pop-tart themes, also made 
appearances. In one cart, four women sprayed a man 
with mustard and ketchup, and the words “make me a 
sandwich” were written on the cart.
There were also carts that seemed completely random, 
featuring eccentric details such as unicorns, a dancing 
lampshade, the tooth fairy, peanut allergies, and a baby 
stroller with streamers.
One cannot mention the Downhill Derby without 
mentioning the nudity. There were a number of carts 
that were downright provocative with nudity or explicit 
themes, including a human hamster wheel powered 
by clothing-phobic men, a gondola featuring the Pope 
caught with her pants down, and a man dressed as 
male genitalia in a hand. This might have led to some 
awkward moments for students who went to the derby 
with their families.
Although the derby may have been uncomfortable for

costume. Right: Two students, one dressed as 
Napoleon, wield a cannon that spewed smoke.

some people, the main ?aw of the show was not its 
subject matter but its pacing. While it was expected 
that some of the carts would break down, it was 
nonetheless irritating to stand around for ?ve minutes 
or so waiting for a cart to work again. Some carts went 
by relatively quickly, but others took a great deal of time 
coming down the hill, mainly due to technical issues. 
There could have been some interesting commentary 
or something else to look at while the carts were being 
?xed.
Overall, the derby was entertaining, but not without 
?aws in its execution. It was a fun, wild start to Carnival 
that will de?nitely keep the campus talking for a few 
days.

Carnival through the years
50years ago
May 8, 1963
The 1963 Carnival theme Phenomenal Phliques included a first-
place booth by Beta Theta Pi based on Peter Pan, a faculty egg 
toss, sorority relays, and plank jousting behind the Morewood 
parking lot. Captain “Beta” Hook walked the plank into a tub 
of water when game players threw plastic knives through port 
holes on the side of the ship, which was surrounded by moving 
water. The Chemistry A team won the egg toss with a 150-foot 
toss across the Cut. Kappa Alpha Theta won both the sorority 
relays and the sorority skit competition. The relays included 
sorority women participating in a broom-riding relay, role race, 
and sack relay.

The first snowy Carnival in recent memory resulted in issues 
with switching from temporary power to permanent power on 
Wednesday night, buggy race delays, and shivering audience 
members in the comedian’s tent. Edward Jackman, the 
headlining comedian, put on a stand-up comedy performance 
with juggling tricks. Jackman also shared with the audience 
that he will be hosting a new NBC series featuring normal 
people who can do funny things. After the comedy show, 
Jackman and his camera crew went around Midway looking for 
funny people to interview for the first episode of the show.

The Saturday morning Buggy races were plagued with 
unexpected mechanical mishaps and human error. The Pi 
Kappa Alpha women’s team was granted a reroll after their 
buggy was forced to swerve to avoid colliding with the lead 
truck in the race. The Beta Theta Pi women were disqualified 
after rolling the fastest time of the day because their buggy 
failed the drop test for brakes. The Sigma Alpha Epsilon men hit 
a pothole and lost a wheel during their roll. Several fans, many 
of whom were underage, were issued citations for possession of 
alcohol in the area adjacent to the buggy track.

As the Democratic primary for the 2008 presidential election 
approached, Chelsea Clinton made an appearance on Midway 
to support her mother Hillary Clinton (D-N.Y.). Clinton’s visit to 
Carnegie Mellon is the first stop on a tour of college campuses 
across the nation in which she moderates a Q & A session 
with college students. Aside from the political buzz, Booth is 
plagued with numerous injuries because of strong winds on 
Midway. One sister of Delta Gamma had to get four staples in 
her head after a wall fell on her while members were finishing 
up assembly of their booth on Saturday night.

The College of Fine Arts hosts its third annual Anti-Gravity 
Downhill Derby, which began as a class project in 2010 and 
has since grown in participation from CFA students. The derby 
pokes fun at Carnival’s stress on buggy, and features often 
scantily-clad students dressed as moving art. The weekend also 
included a performance by Passion Pit and Scotch’n’Soda’s 
rendition of The Drowsy Chaperone. Both shows excited 
audiences, especially when Passion Pit’s performers expressed 
fond feelings for Carnegie Mellon’s campus and students. The 
entire audience is even invited to the next Passion Pit concert in 
Pittsburgh.
