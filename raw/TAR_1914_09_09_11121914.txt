BASKEIBALL LEAN 
LOSES (APIAIN
Last Thursday night the Design 
School foyer was the scene of the most 
brilliant, and gorgeous affairs ever held 
in the history of the institute. The De­
sign students held the first of their 
semi-annual events in the nature of an 
Oriental ball, which by far surpassed 
all expectations.
Stalwart Arabians lounged about on 
divans, beating slowly, but steadily, 
on tom-toms, dancers waved their 
tambourines overhead, Zulus, appar­
ently fresh from their crude huts, wan­
dered about chattering and gesticu­
lating with their harmless spears, fak­
irs mixed with the unwary, Chinamen 
and Japanese discussed their troubles 
and drew upon their pipes, while 
Burnoused Bedoins danced with geisha 
girls, tall black Nubians with harem 
queens, the Caliph with the Cireassian 
slave girl and “foxed” with the Prin­
cess, pigtailed Chinese and Japs tat- 
toed about the floor with hooded 
Egyptians.
The foyer was transformed into an 
oriental interior. The fine stone 
walls were completely covered by red 
draperies stenciled and painted in blue 
and gold. The ends of the foyer were 
transformed from classic to oriental 
in style by the addition of gracefully 
curved arches and openings. The sur­
faces were profusely decorated with 
blue and gold ornament in perfect har­
mony with the other draperies. The 
middle balcony was changed into a 
beautiful pavilion in blue and gold, 
treated somewhat like the ends of the 
foyer. The lighting system was per­
fect. Diffused blue and red lights were 
thrown through the lunes in the foyer 
giving a dun, mellow light very appro­
priate to the setting.
Around the walls were placed divans 
covered with brightly colored tapes­
tries and cushions. Surrounding the 
candelabras at either end of the foyer 
was a huge divan artistically arranged 
in a deep blue light.
A spirited rivalry was taken in the 
gorgeousness and inventiveness of the 
costumes. Every oriental garb was 
represented including Arabian tribes­
men, nobles and women, Turkish garbs 
of all classes, Chinese, Japanese, Hin­
du, Indian, Persian, Zulus and Egyp- 
tion. Nearly all costumes were de­
signed and made by the students them­
selves. The colors and designs were 
magnificent. It was a wonderful sight 
to see men and women of such remote

Last Saturday, Westminster’s strong 
eleven inflicted upon Carnegie, the 
first defeat which the home team has 
suffered on Tech Field this year by 
the score of 16 to 0. The game was 
hard fought from start to finish and 
somewhat closer than the score indi­
cates. The Plaid eleven, which went 
on to the field, did not seem to be 
the same one which defeated Bethany, 
Grove City, and Geneva, for the game 
which they played was, indeed, far 
helow that which they exhibited earl­
ier in the season. In spite of that, 
however, they played with their usual 
rousing fight-to-the-finish spirit. The 
Westminster aggregation outweighed 
Carnegie and put up as excellent a 
brand of football as has been seen on 
Tech Field this year. Their line was 
heavy and powerful, good at opening 
holes, and at the same time a stone 
wall for Tech backs. Rarely ever did 
Carnegie make large gains by means 
of plunges. Westminster had a heavy 
and fast backfield which was very effi­
cient at line bucking. Carnegie’s backs 
played well but with little avail 
against their opponents’ strong de­
fense. The visitors carried the ball 
during the greater part of the game 
and managed to keep it fairly near the 
Plaid goal. Several times when Car­
negie did have the ball they were 
forced to kick.
Strange to say the game was not as 
open as one might have expected as 
neither side resorted much to the for­
ward pass as a means of gaining 
ground. Most of the few made came 
in the second half of the game. By a 
forward pass the Plaid came as near to 
scoring a touchdown as they did at 
any other time in the game. Kesner 
shot a pass to Lauer who barely 
touched the ball. Levy was just in 
front of Lauer and it bounded into his 
arms. The Plaid right end carried it 
through an open field to Westminster’s 
goal, but the umpire refused to count 
the score because the ball was not 
touched by a Westminster man. West­
minster scored their second touch­
down by a beautiful pass from Wherry 
to Strathern.
D. McLaughrey put up an excellent 
game at fullback. He was the oppon­
ents’ most consistent ground gainer 
and, having plenty of weight, was good 
at carrying the ball through the line. 
Buckley, at quarter, ran the team es­
pecially well. Besides this he was a 
good ground gainer, making one run 
of 42 yards for a touchdown, and an­
other run of 40 yards. He also did
r ost of the kicking for his team in 
addition to making a field goal.
Kesner put up the best game for 
the Plaid and made several pretty 
tackles in the open field which pre­
vented possible touchdowns by West- 
r'inster. Oeffinger, also, gained ground 
consistently for Carnegie. The game 
in detail is as follows:
First Quarter.
The game opened with Tech defend­
ing the south goal. Oeffinger kicked 
off but Carnegie was offside and had 
to kick off again after a penalty of 5 
yards. The kick went out of bounds 
on Westminster’s 22-yard line. D. Mac- 
Laughrey carried the ball for a gain 
of 4 yards. Carnegie was twice off 
side, giving the visitors 10 more yards. 
Buckley carried the ball for 6 yards, 
while two line bucks by D. MacLaugh- 
rey made a first down for Westmin­
ster. A couple of plays by Humm 
netted 7 yards. Kesner then tackled 
Buckley for no gain. Westminster 
was forced to kick. Kesner caught 
the ball and carried it to the Plaid
16-yard line. Marshall earned 2 yards 
while Balsinger’s attempt to advance 
the ball was in vain. Kesner then 
kicked the ball to Buckley in the mid­
dle of the field. The Westminster cap­
tain returned it 12 yards. After a few 
plays which gained only 4 yards, Buck­
ley kicked a field goal. Oeffinger 
kicked off to Westminster’s 15 yard 
line and D. MacLaughry ran the ball 
back 12 yards. Humm punted to Car­
negie’s 30-yard line where Kesner re­
ceived the ball and returned it 6 yards. 
Balsinger gained a yard. Carnegie was 
penalized 5 yards for off side. Kes­
ner lost 3 yards and then punted to 
Buckley who carried the ball to West­
minster’s 48-yard line. After a few 
plays the quarter ended. Score: West­
minster 3, Tech 0.
Second Quarter.
The second quarter opened with the 
ball on Carnegie’s 42-yard line. In the 
first play Buckley eluded the Plaid 
tacklers and scored a touchdown. The 
kick out failed, however. Oeffinger 
kicked off to Westminster’s 4-yard 
LLsL.t1 D. Mact.aughry returning the ball 
11 yards. Westminster was penalized 
-o-Hs for off side. Humm booted 
the ball to Balsinger, who returned it 
6 yards to Carnegie’s 42-yard line. The 
Plaid earned a first down when Oef­
finger made 4 and Marshall 7 yards. 
Balsinger lost a yard and Oeffinger 
succeeded in regaining it. On a pass

TUMPANE GOES HOME ON AC­
COUNT OF SICKNESS.
James P. Tumpane, known by all 
the students as “Tump,” left Pitts­
burgh for his home in Adams, Mass., 
on Sunday afternoon, November 8th, 
1914. He was injured by a kick in the 
abdomen which he received in the 
Commercial-Mechanical football game 
on Saturday, October 17th. Tumpane 
was in the hospital for over a week 
after this game and his condition has 
not improved since he came out.
Tumpane was a Senior in the Com­
mercial Engineering course and cap­
tain of the 1915 Varsity basketball 
team. It is a hard blow to the pros­
pects of this year’s team to lose a man 
of the caliber of Tumpane. “Tump” 
had played two years of Varsity ball 
and seemed to be at the height of his 
career at the close of last season. With 
him in line for this year’s team and 
especially as the leader, prospects for 
a winning combination were very 
good. His personality on the team will 
be sadly missed because Tumpane has 
the make up and spirit of what may 
truly be called an ideal Tech man.
Besides being a member of the bas­
ketball team, Tumpane was head of 
the Advertising Bureau, and was the 
man who received the Senior scholar­
ship last year. 1915 Science class 
loses one of its most valuable mem­
bers and a man who has won many 
friends around the schools.
It is unlikely that Tumpane will re­
turn to school this year, although he 
expects to next year.
CROSS-COUNTRY TRY-OUTS HELD.
Rieser Wins Event in Fast Time Under 
Ideal Weather Conditions.
Try-outs for the cross-country team 
were held on November 4th. Twenty 
men entered the run, and all finished 
apparently in good condition. The run 
was over a five-mile course through the 
park. The results of the race in sev­
eral cases were quite a surprise. Rie­
ser, Varsity track man of last year, 
won, although he was closely pressed 
by Dunseith, our premier quarter- 
miler. Rieser was not picked to win 
and clearly surprised the entire field. 
This man always seems to have some­
thing in reserve and never shows his 
true pace until placed in competition. 
Dunseith ran in good form and he 
shows prospects of developing into a

PITTSBURGH, PA., NOV. 12, 1914
THE PITT GAME.
When we read not long ago of the 
Harvard football players meeting and 
greeting their sturdy Michigan oppon­
ents after the latter had finished prac­
ticing in the Harvard stadium the day 
prior to the Harvard-Michigan game, 
we could not help admiring such 
sportsmanlike conduct, and at the 
same time, hoping that a similar spirit 
might some day prevail between the 
two local rivals, Pitt and Tech.
The impression is prevalent here 
that Pitt’s athletic teams are prepared 
to win at any cost. Whether this be 
true or not we cannot say because of 
our lack of knowledge of the Pitt 
coaching methods. Moreover, on the 
eve of the football struggle between 
Pitt and Carnegie, it would be very 
untimely for us to criticize our op­
ponents. The only thing we can do is 
to inform our own team as to what is 
expected of it. Above all, the stu­
dents of Carnegie demand that their 
eleven play clean football. This de­
mand is not a reflection on past per­
formances, for we have always boasted 
of our true sportsmanship; but on the 
contrary, it is an emphatic appeal at 
a critical moment, for a continuation 
of our honest athletic policy. In the 
coming contest with the Blue and 
Gold, the Plaid team as well as its 
rooters, must demonstrate to Pitt and 
to Pittsburgh the Carnegie spirit of 
fair play.
Though the odds are against us, 
Coach Steffen’s men may be counted 
upon to put up a game fight. If we 
are victorious, the town will not be 
large enough to hold us; if we are de­
feated, we shall by no means be dis­
graced. But irrespective of the out­
come, if by our playing, we can create 
a more friendly feeling between Pitt 
and Tech, if we can command the re­
spect of our opponents, we shall be
accomplishing a great deal toward the 
final establishment of that true sports­
manlike rivalry so desirable between 
these two Pittsburgh schools.
THE BAND.
In keeping with the excellent show­
ing of the tootball team this fall, has 
been the marked progress made by the 
Carnegie Band. The improvement has 
been manifest both in the size and the 
usefulness of the organization. It 
consists at present of twenty-six mem­
bers of whom only seven will be lost 
by graduation, a prospect which au­
gurs well for its future development. 
The band has been in evidence at all 
of the football games, it has led sev­
eral student parades, and it has op- 
peared at private class functions, al­
ways serving its purpose of enliven­
ing and entertaining the assembled 
crowds. The success so far this sea­
son is due in no large measure to the 
efforts of its manager, H. E. Gum- 
bart, ’15. Through his influence a com­
petent leader was obtained and under 
the instructive guidance of Mr. Sulli­
van the band has acquired its present 
degree of proficiency.
The Tartan believes it voices the 
student sentiment when it assures the 
members of the band that their work 
is appreciated. Some mark of recog­
nition is certainly due them and we 
therefore deem it fitting to lend our 
support to their petition to the Stu­
dent Activities Committee for an ap­
propriation with which to purchase uni­
forms. It is not becoming an institu­
tion of our size to foster an organiza­
tion of this kind not presentable on 
public occasions, yet there is no over­
looking the fact that the band as it 
is today, offers a rather disorganized 
appearance to a stranger.
The players are unusually enthusi­
astic this year. The students should 
encourage them as much as possible, 
until such a state of perfection will be 
reached that on hearing it perform, we 
shall proudly be able to exclaim, “Just 
listen to the band!”
ATHLETIC TROPHIES.
Several times in past years, move­
ments have been started to the end of 
collecting the various trophies won 
in the athletic contests of the past and 
placing them in a fitting place for 
exhibition. The lack of a suitable lo­
cation in which to expose them to the 
admiring gaze of the posterity of our 
Alma Mater has so far prevented any 
definite action being taken, and the 
matter has been passed on from year 
to year with no results.
Many of these tributes to the work 
of our athletic teams in previous 
years repose at present in the club 
rooms in different schools. Others it is 
believed are in the hands of former 
managers, especially many of the track 
trophies which are reported as never 
having been turned in, probably be­
cause the managers felt that there was 
no place to put them. Still more are 
in the office of Secretary Field who 
heartily endorses any attempt towards 
providing another suitable place for 
them.
It is therefore with great pleasure
that we publish the two following let­
ters received by the Director. As Mr. 
McCulloch states, the club room in the 
Central Building is a most fitting loca­
tion for their display. Means should 
be taken at once towards the segre­
gation of all trophies. There is not 
much doubt but that the Student Ac­
tivities Committee would be able to 
provide the means for a proper display 
of all prizes. It is to be hoped that 
attempts of past years will now cul­
minate in success.
Pittsburgh, Pa., Oct. 26, 1914. 
Mr. Dear Mr. Hamerschlag:
A few days ago, while calling on a 
former Tech man, a member of the 
1906 football team, I noticed in his 
room an old football, which I believe 
to be the first real football trophy ever 
won by a Tech team. I persuaded him 
to give it up, arguing that its proper 
place was the Trophy Room at the 
School. Truth to tell, he had come to 
the same conclusion himself, and was 
anxious to have it returned.
I therefore have given it to one of 
the students, asking him to see that 
it is placed in its lawful niche in our 
“Hall of Fame.”
And may it be a source of inspira­
tion to our splendid 1914 team, and en­
able them to knock the cockiness out 
of our ancient enemy—Pitt!
Sincerely yours,
“1909”
October 29, 1914. 
Dr. A. A. Hamerschlag, Director,
Carnegie Institute of Technology. 
Dear Sir:
I have received a copy of the letter 
sent to you by a member of the class 
of 1906, in which he mentions having 
located a football trophy, and having 
•same returned to us.
I believe that the place for such 
trophies now is the Carnegie Union 
Club-room, and that an effort be made 
to secure all of the trophies of past 
years, and place them there. Mr. Field 
has quite a number of such trophies 
in his office at present, and he would 
probably be glad of the opportunity to 
be relieved of them.
Individual students who may have 
secured trophies during the past few 
years, I am sure would welcome such 
a movement as this, and put whatever 
they may have secured at our dis­
posal.
I would suggest that the Director ap­
point a committee to take the neces­
sary steps toward securing as many as 
possible of the trophies won by Tech 
teams in the past, and put them in the 
Carnegie Union Club-room in suitable 
trophy cases.
Very truly yours,
J. HOWARD McCULLOCH.

PLAID TO MEET PITT.
Biggest Game of Year For Tech at 
Forbes Field Saturday.
This year’s football season will 
reach its climax this Saturday when 
the Plaid goes to Forbes Field to meet 
the team that represents our most bit­
ter rivals, Pitt. The enthusiasm and 
spirit shown around school these last 
few days demonstrates forcibly what 
can be expected at Saturday’s game. 
This is THE game of the season as far 
as Tech is concerned. It is the game 
we have been looking forward to all 
year and it is the contest for which 
we have been prepared most. We 
must make a creditable showing. Al­
though we received quite a set-back 
last week from Westminster, the men 
are going to forget this defeat and 
live for the one game, the game with 
Pitt. The score last Saturday does 
not prove the true worth of our team. 
Admitting that we were outplayed, 
nevertheless we will all agree that 
Westminster received all the breaks 
of the game, both in luck and in offi­
ciating. When an opposing player ad­
mits a point in favor of his opponents 
and an official rules against true con­
ditions, then we can say that there 
was surely something “unsound in the 
state of Denmark.” This was the con­
dition of affairs in last Saturday’s 
game.
McLaughrey, the Westminster fulb 
back, frankly told me of the Carnegie 
men after the contest that he had 
touched the ball on which Tech was 
supposed to have made an illegal 
touchdown. If the officials, that is, 
Umpire Cutts, Avho practically ran the 
entire game, had given Carnegie their 
just rights, the score at this stage 
would have been 9-7 and we would 
have had a chance to win. Of course 
we are not offering any excuse for 
the loss of the game because we have 
taken the result in a sportsmanlike 
manner and have shown ourselves to 
be good losers, but nevertheless we 
feel justified in asserting our claim 
of ill luck.
We can not dope out the result of 
any game. On comparative scores 
between Westminster, Pitt and Tech, 
we might say that we will be decis­
ively beaten. But on the other hand, 
compare the result of the Lehigh-State 
game with that of our team’s contest 
against Lehigh. Lehigh walloped 
State 20-7, whereas they were scarcely 
able to defeat Carnegie. We can al­
ways figure State on the par with 
Pitt, so we have the dope on either 
side. The entire matter rests on the 
form displayed on the day of the game. 
If we are able to put up the same front 
against Pitt as we did against Lehigh, 
then Pitt will have a mighty time to 
win the game. All the boys are de­
termined that we shall not be humili­
ated. It is now up to the student body 
to assert their opinion in the same 
manner, and they can only do this by 
turning out to the man to help the 
team along. Every student in school 
should be at this game to give his lit­
tle help. We have a fighting chance 
at the best and the men need help at 
this stage. So, fellows, be prepared to 
win out, to give the team all the en­
couragement you have. Show your
DIRECTOR HAMERSCHLAG
SPEAKS IN HARTFORD.
One of the Principal Speakers at Dedi­
cation of Williams Memorial, 
Trinity College.
Williams Memorial, Trinity College’s 
new library and administration build­
ing, a gift of the late J. Pierpont Mor­
gan, was formally dedicated at exer­
cises held in Alumni hall, Saturday 
morning, October 31. This building 
had been but recently completed and 
had been made possible by a gift of 
$225,000 by the late financier, a few 
years ago. In honor of the occasion, 
alumni, undergraduates and notable 
personages, including presidents of 
many colleges and universities, gath­
ered for the exercises. Director Ham- 
erschlag was one of the prominent 
men to make dedication addresses.
The Director, in his address, spoke 
feelingly of the life and labors of the 
donor, the late J. Pierpont Morgan, 
and of the services of President Luther 
through years of planning for a pro­
gressive material and spiritual growth 
of the college. He mentioned the fact 
that the J. Ewing Mear’s sanitary sci­
ence collection in the Trinity Library 
was the best collection of its kind in 
America. He also said that the pres­
ent day man of science should recog­
nize the importance of literature as 
a vital part of his work, for, in the 
great body of classical literature, he 
can find inspiration so great that great 
problems will be within his grasp, but 
if he neglects them, his soul is dead.
WHAT IS A BANQUET?
A banquet is an assemblage of men 
who slyly look at their watches, wish­
ing they were in bed, while loudly 
proclaiming they are jolly good fel­
lows and won’t go home till morn­
ing.—Poor Richard, Jr.’s Almanack.
What England needs is one of those 
Culebra slides in the Kiel Canal.— 
Boston Transcript.
Tech spirit and make Saturday, No­
vember 14th, a day which you will 
never forget. Let’s make this day 
history and one well worth recalling.
Special arrangements have been 
made for a Tech cheering section. We 
will probably have the same place oc­
cupied by the W. and J. rooters last 
Saturday. The Athletic Association, 
through the football management, 
Avishes to announce that student books 
or season passes will be honored at 
the Tech cheering section. Football 
coupon number six will be detached. 
Or if any one wishes to sit in the 
grandstand they will receive a twenty- 
five cent credit at the box office upon 
presentation of the coupon book. Ad­
vance sale tickets will also be held 
in the Administration Building lobby. 
Now men, don’t forget, everybody is 
going to be at that game on Saturday 
and in the stand for the kickoff at 2:30.
To the men of the team, we might 
say a word in the way of encourage­
ment. Show that old Tech fellows 
fight, and give Pitt all you have. Good 
luck to you, men, and here’s hoping 
that the Plaid waives on top at the 
end of Saturday’s contest.
NEW SCHOOL SONGS.
Below is the song, “Dear Old Tech,” 
which the Science students gave such 
a hearty support and approval at their 
Wednesday Mass Meeting a week ago 
and the Industries School tried out 
this week. Cameron, Sheldon, and 
others have written two more, “THE 
WARRIORS BOLD FROM TECH” and 
“CARNEGIE FOREVER”, which were 
first tried by the students at the Mass 
Meeting yesterday.
Since these songs will probably be 
sung against Pitt—certainly “Dear 
Old Tech” will—it is up to the stu­
dents to learn them.

man, who might be able to fill Hasel- 
ton’s shoes. Slater, Walker, Bayard, 
Moore, and Handelman finished in the 
order named. Slater, a new man, gave 
a remarkable demonstration of 
strength and endurance. Handelman 
was a complete disappointment. He 
was a member of last year’s cross­
country team and the manner in which 
he had been running lately, placed 
him as the man to be the runner up 
or even the winner. Handelman was 
probably in poor condition and should 
give a better account of himself the 
next time.
Several meets are to be held in the 
near future. Tech will enter a team 
in the P. A. A. run on the 14th, this 
Saturday. The race will finish on 
Forbes Field just prior to the foot­
ball game. Pitt will also have a team 
entered so there will be a chance for 
some of Carnegie’s adherents to cheer 
their favorites on to victory. The 
next meet to be held around this dis­
trict will be run at Crafton under the 
auspices of the Crafton A. A. We won 
this event last year against a crack 
field and hope to repeat the perform­
ance.

MR. COOPER LECTURES.
Mr. Charles C. Cooper, head worker 
at the Kingsley House, lectured to a 
number of the faculty and students of 
the Margaret Morrison School last 
Thursday morning at ten-thirty o’clock. 
The subject of the lecture was “The 
Settlement House and Its Relation to 
the Neighborhood.”
Mr. Cooper showed that the Settle­
ment furnishes a neighborliness, and 
an interpretation of the life of the 
neighborhood. He said the Settlement 
House should be the pioneer in social 
experience, and offer moral leadership 
for the community.
This lecture completed the series 
on Community Work. Beginning No­
vember 19, there will be a group of 
lectures given on Family Welfare un­
der the direction of J. Byron Deacon, 
Secretary of Associated Charities.
All students are invited by the De­
partment of Social Service to attend 
these lectures.
M. M. C. S. DELEGATES AT 
CAMBRIDGE.
Miss Lu Hartman and Miss Grace 
"ht left Wednesday evening, No­
vember 4, for Cambridge, Mass., to 
attend the convention of the Woman’s 
Inter-collegiate Self Government Asso­
ciation which is being held at Rad- 
cliffe College. Miss Hartman and 
Miss Searight will return to school 
this week.
SENIORS ENTERTAIN PLEBES.
Friday afternoon, directly after 
three-thirty, the Senior class assembled 
in the Students’ Recreation Room to 
welcome the Plebes to an informal en­
tertainment which had been arranged 
for their pleasure. Eliza Dickey, pres­
ident of the Senior class, received at 
the door, and in a cordial manner 
greeted the members of the new class 
in such a way as to make them feel 
perfectly at home.
The afternoon’s gaiety was com­
menced with dancing. Later in the 
afternoon, Mary Williams sang sev­
eral selections, and following this the 
Senior Quartette rendered most effi­
ciently a unique production of the 
school songs and cheers. The quar­
tette is composed of Miss Grace Car­
rol, Miss Florence Lytle, Miss Sara 
Murray and Miss Esther King. The 
Woman’s Song was sung as an encore.
The next thing on the program fur­
nished much amusement. Miss Dickey 
announced that a number of the Sen* 
iors would impersonate members of 
the faculty, and that every one should
-’/'ss whom they were representing. 
This was easy because of the excellent 
acting on the part of the girls. Fol­
lowing was the caste;
Marguerite Spilman...........Miss Higgins
Lorna Williams ......................Prof. Day
Hazel Freeland.....................Miss Stoner
Millicent Leech...............Prof. Esquerre
Dorothy Skinner .................Miss Parry
Anna Freeman......................Miss Hayden
Nelle Kern ............................Miss Collet
Refreshments were served by mem­
bers of the Senior class, and much of 
the party’s success was due to the 
girls who stayed in the kitchen and 
served the salad and ice cream.
Louise MacMillan was chairman of 
the refreshment committee, and gen­
eral boss of the whole affair.
This was the first entertainment 
given in the new recreation room since 
the arrival of the furniture. The room 
is now lovely with its assortment of 
wicker chairs and tables. There is a 
piano in the room, and the floor is in 
good condition for dancing.
The Seniors realize that the num­
ber of school entertainments for them 
are getting fewer and fewer; but we 
hope that the Plebes will all be in Mar­
garet Morrison long enough to enjoy 
many more such occasions as that of 
last week.
ITEMS OF INTEREST.
Mrs. John Thomas Andrews, of Oak- 
mont, visited the school on Thursday 
of last week. Mrs. Andrews will be 
remembered as Miss Ruth Jones, one 
of the old girls. Miss Jones was mar­
ried during the past summer. While 
a student in Ma garet Morrison she 
made r any friends. She was in the 
Home Arts and Crafts Department, and 
a member of the Alpha Sigma Pi So­
ciety.

GRAND.
“The Superman” is coming to the 
Grand Opera House for one week in 
Mr. Davis’ super-vaudeville beginning 
Monday matinee, November 16. In 
this instance the “Superman” is not 
a play by George Bernard Shaw but 
a personality, and that personality the 
iggest and most varied in all the show 
world. On the bills they call him Syl* 
vester Schaffer. All the other acts 
in the program will be up to the well 
established high standard for which 
the Grand Opera House is celebrated.
ORIENTAL BALL BRILLIANT AFFAIR
Continued from Page 1 
nations mingling and chatting in one 
great assembly. Clever make-up and 
mysterious actions added an interest 
which gave the festival the touch of 
orientalism.
The music throughout was oriental. 
A feature of the evening was a 
dance “The Sword of Sukardon” to 
Liszts’ “Second Hungarian Rhapsody,” 
pe-formed with grace and refinement 
by Miss Erna Seibel. The dance was 
Icvised by H. P. Smith, a student in 
the school. The dance deserves much
edit to both performer and author.
he audience squatted in oriental fash­
ion on the main foyer floor, a sight 
v hich brought one back to the scenes 
in the mosques abroad.
Another feature of the evening was 
a song especially written for the oc­
casion by Thomas Malie and E. H. 
Gilg. “Tommie” sang the “Oriental 
Rag” as the new song was entitled 
with the usual snap and vigor.
The Zulus gave a demonstration in 
the form of a native war dance, so 
realistic did it appear that several 
of the audience became frightened. 
During the course of the evening a 
terrific sandstorm broke in all its fury. 
Confetti, baloons, and serpentines re­
placed the sand. The vari-colored 
paper mingled with the colored light 
gave an effect hard to conceive. Aside 
from the special features, dancing 
formed the chief amusement. Re­
freshments were served in perfect ac­
cord with the setting.
Until a late hour in the evening all 
who danced, sang and took part in the 
mirth and jollification were masked. 
When the muezzin called from his por­
tico which overlooked the concourse 
of Easterners all removed the shield 
from their eyes, and talked to one an­
other as they are accustomed to do in 
their classrooms.
The entry of the Eastern life into 
that of the art students of Carnegie 
follows the example of the Beaux Arts 
ball of artists of the Latin Quarter of 
Paris.
Much credit and thanks must be giv­
en to Prof. Vincent P. Sollom, who de­
signed and directed the execution of 
the decorations and lighting effects. 
The students in general worked hard 
for the success of the ball. Mr. Horn- 
bostel initiated the custom in the Rom­
an Ball of last year. The affair was 
such a great success that it was de­
cided to continue such in the future. 
Plans are being discussed now for the 
spring festival on the same nature 
but of a different period.

One of the most brilliant comedies 
turned out by an American playwright 
is “The New York Idea,” written by 
Langdon Mitchell, son of the late Dr.
S. Wier Mitchell, of Philadelphia, and 
which was produced with emphatic 
success by Mrs. Fiske. This play will 
be offering in the Schenley Theatre 
next week and will serve to introduce 
to playgoers the new leading woman 
of the organization, Miss Frances Ring.
TEACHERS’ CLUB NOTES.
On the eve of Friday last, Teachers' 
Club activities took the form of initiat­
ing a new member of the clan. The 
program put the subject through a 
gruelling test of mental and moral 
courage, and when the unfortunate (?) 
one was required to lift a board on 
each end of which stood a robust vet­
eran, it goes without saying that the 
new member must toe the mark phys­
ically. The effects of the torture, 
however, were quickly dispersed at the 
well-aranged feed which followed. 
Never before was the club room the 
seat of such mirth and good fellow­
ship.

STUDENT ACTIVITIES BOARD.
Last Friday night the Middle Class 
School of Applied Industries held full 
sway at the Schenley Hotel in the first 
of a series of banquets planned for the 
present school year. Some fifty stu­
dents gathered around the large table 
in the conservatory which was cleared 
especially for this pleasant function. 
Following the generous repast, inter­
spersed with several well rendered 
piano selections by Mr. Means, the 
cigars and tobies were lit, and, follow­
ing a splendid address made by Toast­
master Parker welcoming all the stu­
dents, a number of them were called 
upon to speak befitting the occasion. 
President McDowell, and his associate 
officers, Zeilman and Hedlund, echoed 
the sentiments of all that such occa­
sion as this one can do more to cement 
the fellowship of the class than any 
other medium. Dean Connelley and 
his assistant, Mr. Hartman, arriving 
late, gave splendid addresses on the 
fellowship of man and its relation to 
school activities. Following a round 
of cheers and songs the party broke 
up with its expression of thanks to the 
committee in charge, Students Liggett 
and Parker.
The Student Activities Board has en­
tered upon the year’s work. Two 
weeks ago, the representatives from 
the various schools met, and in con­
junction with Secretary Fields, adopt­
ed a new constitution somewhat dif­
ferent than the one previously in exist­
ence. This organization is composed 
of alumni, night and day representa­
tives of the three schools, it controls 
the funds covering the recognized non- 
athletic activities, such as the band, 
The Thistle, etc. The officers elected 
for the coming year are:
President, Carl F. Peters.
Vice President, J. L. Mooney. 
Secretary, D. P. Murphy.
A treasurer is to be chosen by the 
joint bodies of the three schools.

Their country and their homes have

DESIGN SCHOOL NOTES
THREE IRISH PLAYS REPEATED.
The Department of Drama repeated 
their production of the Irish plays last 
Friday and Saturday evening. The 
teachers of the local institutions were 
present on Friday evening and stu­
dents Saturday evening. Refreshments 
were served during the intermission.
The plays are very seldom seen on 
the stage now. They portray the su­
perstitions and customs of the Irish 
people very much during the reign of 
feudalism. Mr. Stevens explained to 
the audience the purpose and aim of 
such productions to be given in the 
future.
“Shadow of the Glen” was the first 
play of the series. It was written by 
John Millington Synge.
Dramatis Personae
Daniel Burke...............Charles H. Duffy
Nora Burke . .Annabel Marie Ramesy
Michael Dara...........Harold D. Munnis
A Tramp...............Charles H. Meredith
Scene—A house at the head of a glen 
in County Wicklow.
SYNOPSIS.
“The Shadow of the Glen” was the 
first of J. M. Synge’s plays to be pro­
duced. It reveals the tragedy of a 
high-spirited woman whose life passes 
between a savage old man, a young 
poltroon, and a homeless vagabond. 
The country itself has set its mark 
upon the people of the play; the scene 
is laid by the dark glens and tarns of 
the Wicklow hills.
“The Betrayal” was written and di­
rected by Padraic Colum, who was 
present here about two weeks ago.
Dramatis Personae 
Morgan Lefroy .. Charles H. Meredith
Gideon Lefroy...........Charles H. Duffy
The Bellman ....Frederic McConnell 
Peg, the Ballad Singer.....................
.......................................Alice S. Guthrie
Scene—A room in Gideon Lefroy’s Inn. 
Time—During the Eighteenth Century.
SYNOPSIS.
The action of “The Betrayal” takes 
place in Ireland about the year 1790. 
It was a time of great disorganization. 
All over the country there was a 
smothered peasant revolt due to an 
evil system of lantenure. The peasants 
had to pay rent to landlords and sub­
landlords and tithes to the Established 
Churches. In addition they were 
preyed upon by a crowd of parasites, 
land agents, bailiffs, tithe-proctors and 
the like. Sometimes they murdered 
an agent or a tithe-proctor and the
land-owning classes made reprisals by 
transporting crowds of peasants or 
by impressing them into British ships. 
It became a religious obligation on 
the part of the peasantry to keep the 
secret of agrarian crime or agrarian 
combinations.
“The Betrayal” has for its action 
an attempt to break down this religious 
obligation.
At the period of the play an Irish 
Brigade was in the service of the 
French. Those who left Ireland to join 
the Brigade were known as “The Wild 
Geese.”
“The King’s Threshold,” by William 
Butler Yeats, was a strong play depict­
ing the rights of a subjected people.

tury.
SYNOPSIS.
“The King’s Threshold” seems to be 
the most personal of Mr. Yeats’ plays. 
The central character is a poet who 
prefers to starve to death rather than 
abate by one jot the dignity that at­
taches to the office of a poet. Sean­
chan does not regard himself as a 
mere man of words: it is his office to 
reveal those Images or Ideas which 
are outside the world, but of which 
the world must have knowledge if it 
is to keep in the order of eternal 
things. As Seanchan lies on the 
King’s stair the glory, the stength, and 
the fashion of the world crowd around 
him. At last the King becomes great 
enough to understand what the poet 
represents, and he gives his crown 
back into the hands that in the old 
days made the crown; all kneel be­
cause all learn that glory, beauty, holi­
ness and desire are reflections of the 
poet’s vision of the ideas that are be­
yond the world.

PANAMA-PACIFIC INTERNATIONAL 
EXPOSITION—1915.
San Francisco, Cal., 
Aug. 31, 1914. 
Mr. James Horsbaugh, Jr.,
General Passenger Agent,
Southern Pacific,
Flood Bldg, San Francisco.
My dear Mr. Horsbaugh:
At our last conference, you asked 
me to submit suggestions that might be 
of service to special parties of stu­
dents contemplating a visit to the Ex­
position in 1915. Permit me to offer 
the following:
1. Practically all visiting the Ex­
position for purposes of study will be 
concerned not only with exhibits, but 
with congresses and conventions. Un­
der the “grouping” plan that has been 
adopted by this Bureau, it will be pos­
sible for those visiting the Exposition 
to time their visits so they may be 
able to attend all programs along their 
line of interest, and all at the ex­
pense of one trip to San Francisco. 
Under the “grouping” plan, the great­
er part of the congresses and conven­
tions with related interests will meet 
in San Francisco within a period ex­
tending over from one to three weeks. 
Among the periods already tentatively 
or finally established are those con­
cerned with education, science, his­
tory, economics, genealogy, social 
service, engineering, insurance, den­
tistry, medicine and hygiene, gas, agri­
culture, horticulture, nursing, high 
school fraternities, college fraterni­
ties, etc., etc. As the exhibits 
^Tin be on display throughout the 
life of the Exposition, parties of stu­
dents should first take into account 
these “groupings” of congresses and 
conventions. In establishing these 
“groupings”, the vacation periods for 
the various professions and callings 
have been taken into account insofar 
as possible. For instance, the educa­
tional “group” will extend from August 
16th to September 3rd, 1915, or dur­
ing the regular vacation period in the 
schools.
2. The educational exhibits will be 
entirely different from those displayed 
at any past Exposition. In the place 
of comprehensive exhibits, showing the 
whole range of educational work of 
cities, states and institutions, special 
type exhibits will be installed, showing 
with little, if any, duplication, those 
lines of educational work in which 
cities, states and institutions excel. To 
secure the greatest possible value 
from a study of selected exhibits, they 
should be explained by the educa­
tional experts in charge. On pre-ar­
ranged days, it will be possible for par­
ties of students to visit exhibits and 
have talks or lectures given by those 
in charge. These talks would, of 
course, be fully illustrated by the ex­
hibits themselves. Class demonstra­
tions will also be given on many lines 
in the Palace of Education. It will 
be possible to arrange for these demon­
strations to be given for the benefit 
of parties of students. Of course, all 
this should be pre-arranged, to con­
serve time and secure results.
3. In the same way, exhibits might 
be selected from any department for 
study by groups of students, with ex­
planatory talks by the experts in 
charge of such exhibits. Any problems 
concerned with social economy, agri­
culture, horticulture, live stock, com­
merce, transportation, food products, 
art, industry, etc., etc., could in this 
way be systematically studied. This 
combination of lectures, with illustra­
tive exhibits and demonstrations, 
would make it worth while for groups 
of students to make special studies on 
selected lines at the Exposition.
4. Besides this intensive study of 
selected exhibits, it seems very cer­
tain that parties of students would also 
desire to make studies of various parts 
of the Exposition. It would seem, 
therefore, to be desirable for some one 
representing the party in advance not 
only to select the exhibits for special 
study, but to select the more striking 
parts of the Exposition that might be 
visited within the time available.
5. Parties of students visiting the 
Exposition for attendance at certain 
conventions, and for a special study 
of certain exhibits, would also desire, 
in most cases, to visit institutions and 
industries related to their studies. In 
all cases, such parties should, in a pre­
arranged way, be brought in touch 
with certain institutions and indus­
tries, so their time might be con­
served, and the best results secured 
for them along with a proper presenta­
tion of those things in California that 
are worth while.
6. A recognized weakness at all 
Expositions held in the past has been 
that numbers of congresses and con­
ferences have received no advance in­
formation in definite organized form 
concerning the exhibits illustrating 
their respective lines of interest. At 
the suggestion of this Bureau, many 
educational, scientific and technical 
congresses and conferences meeting 
in San Francisco in 1915 will have 
committees of members, in all cases 
recognized experts, make a survey of 
the exhibits shortly after the Exposi­
tion opens in February, 1915. This 
survey, listing exhibits in which the 
members will be especially interested, 
will be issued as a printed outline by 
these associations and mailed to their 
members from two to four months in 
advance of the dates selected for such 
conferences and congresses.
These outlines will be illustrated 
with maps showing how the various 
Exposition entrances may be conven­
iently reached from the hotel district 
and how the exhibits listed may be 
located on the grounds and in the 
various exhibit palaces. In many in­
stances, papers presented before vari­
ous associations will be based in part 
on exhibits. Under this plan the Ex­
position is regarded as a working lab­
oratory in its relation to congresses 
and conferences. In this way it is 
hoped that the Exposition, both 
through congresses and exhibits, may 
have a definite message to all lines 
of educational, scientific and indus­
trial thought.
Trusting that these suggestions 
may be of service to you and to special 
parties contemplating a visit to the 
Exposition in 1915, I am
Very sincerely yours,
JAS. A. BARR, 
Director of Congresses.
SCIENCE SCHOOL NOTES
SCIENCE GENERAL LECTURE.
The general lecture on Wednesday, 
November 4, in the Science School, 
was all that Dean Leete wished it to 
be, when he asked Balsinger, the Sen­
ior class president, to have a good 
rousing mass meeting.
Mr. Balsinger announced that Chan­
cellor S. B. McCormick, of Pitt, would 
speak at the General Lecture Novem­
ber 11, and urged all the fellows to 
be present in goodly numbers to greet 
the head of the school across the way.
The various reports from com­
mittees were given and it was an­
nounced that the Science School had 
contributed $52.34 towards the team 
blankets.
After a few cheers were led by 
“Dink” Merrill, Jack Cameron told 
about the preparations for the Pitt 
game. A new song composed by the 
Glee Club last season, was tried and 
voted an instant success. Mr. Camer­
on said he would publish it in The 
Tartan so that there is no need to 
rewrite it here.
The song was so popular and so full 
of spirit, that the fellows insisted on 
singing it over three or four times, 
and are still singing it everywhere. 
It seems well on its way to become a 
school song.
During this time a popular person 
in the form of Mgr. Rownds of the team 
entered and after the singing he was 
prevailed upon to say a few words. 
Among other things he said that the 
student tickets would be good for the 
Pitt game which notice was received 
very favorably. He also asked the fel­
lows to stay away from the field when 
secret practice was held.
Announcement was then made of 
preparations for a smoker or dance in 
the Carnegie Union on the night of 
the Pitt game. Whether it will be 
a smoker or a dance will be divulged 
later.
“Bennie” Hartmann announced the 
publishing of the Supplement to the 
Handbook which will soon appear.
The meeting then adjourned after 
the announcement of a rooters’ meet­
ing on the field Friday evening.

minster was again penalized 15 yards 
for holding and after one play, had

Tech’s 8-yard line and ran it back 25 
yards. After a 5-yard gain by Bal­
singer, Westminster intercepted a for­
ward pass. Buckley was unable to 
gain any ground, due to a pretty tackle 
by Marshall. D. MacLaughry like­
wise was unable to advance the ball. 
Humm punted to Kesner on the 38- 
yard line and the little quarter re­
turned the ball 11 yards. Balsinger 
and Lauer gained a yard apiece. Then 
Kesner made a forward. Levy, who 
caught the ball, scored, but the pass 
was declared incomplete. * Carnegie

quarter ended. Score: Westminster
9, Tech 0.

AN EFFICIENCY TEST.
A final examination paper from a 
technical school not over a thousanu 
miles away from Pittsburgh fell into 
the possession of one of the teachers 
in the Applied Science School. It 
looked pretty easy and so he “sprung’' 
it on one of his classes at a regularly 
scheduled exercise. Owing to a fac­
ulty ruling, results are not available 
except that the instructor’s opinion 
was amply sustained. We do not be­
lieve in decrying other institutions, 
but this helps to confirm our already 
established opinion concerning the 
worth of our Alma Mater.
WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA
