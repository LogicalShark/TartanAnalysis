Election security in PA is flawedGSA gives report on priorities and progress
The signs on The Cut: a project meant to start a reaction

Much has been said in the news 
landscape on the topic of election 
security and integrity, especially 
after it became clear that Russian 
trolls used hacking and fake so-
cial media accounts to in?uence 
the 2016 election. Besides foreign 
in?uence on election discourse, 
there have also been concerns 
about the security of our voting 
system infrastructure and its vul-
nerability to hacking by malicious 
actors.
Recently, a team of Carnegie 
Mellon graduates from the Heinz 
College focused on election 
security in Allegheny County for 
their capstone project. According 
to a university press release, the 
students analyzed our local elec-
tion processes and election data 
from the past eighteen years to

On Thursday, Nov. 15, the 
Graduate Student Assembly 
(GSA) met in Rangos Hall for a 
3-year progress update of their 
ambitious, 10 year Strategic 
Plan that was released in 2015. 
The Plan’s stated mission was 
“to advocate for and support the 
diverse needs of all Carnegie 
Mellon University gradu-
ate students in their personal, 
professional, and public lives.”
The Strategic Plan has four 
primary themes, all of which are 
broken down into distinct areas 
with more concrete goals: Holistic 
Graduate Student Experience, 
Relationship to Campus Environ-
ment, Supporting a Diverse Com-
munity, and Development Beyond 
the Classroom. 
The Holistic Graduate Student 
Experience is perhaps one of the 
most signi?cant goals. “While 
graduate education has tradi-
tionally focused on professional 
development,” the plan states, 
“there are many factors that im-
pact a graduate student’s holistic 
experience at Carnegie Mellon.” 
The plan sought to improve and 
support the graduate students in 
four primary areas: Health and 
Wellbeing — which included ac-
cess to mental health resources 
and the development of programs 
to promote healthy lifestyles — 
Sense of Community, Financial 
Security, and Family Support.
At Thursday’s meeting, the 
progress that has been made was 
celebrated and areas that have 
yet to be reformed were brought 
into focus. In attendance were 
university administrators, alum-
ni, and more than 100 graduate 
student representatives, of which 
there are 103 across all univer-
sity departments. The Carnegie 
Mellon administration was repre-
sented by Interim Provost Laurie 
Weingart, Vice President of Uni-
versity Affairs Gina Casalegno, 
and Vice Provost for Education 
Amy Burkert among others.
Many of the current graduate 
students were not enrolled 
when the Strategic Plan was 
released in 2015, and the Prog-
ress Meeting served to restate the 
plan’s signi?cance. The gradu-
ate student population now rep-
resents more than half of the 
student population, with “about 
5,600 masters students and 2,000 
doctoral students,” according 
to Provost Laurie Weingart, and 
the proportion of international 
students rose from 60 percent to 
63 percent.
Dr. Carolyn Commer, intro-
duced as the “Mastermind behind 
the original 2015- 2025 Strategic 
Plan” who served as President of 
GSA from 2014 to 2016 and re-
ceived a PhD in Rhetoric at Carn-
egie Mellon in 2016, spoke about 
what inspired the creation of the 
original plan. “I want to draw your 
attention to the choice we made; 
that our Strategic plan was not

As many on campus noticed these past few weeks, the Cut sidewalk has been fringed with 
several poster boards, each with its own religious message of tolerance, love, community, and 
peace. The posters went up almost immediately following the Tree of Life shooting, and stayed 
through wind and rain, until just this past Monday. The Tartan spoke to an organizer of the initia-
tive, Clytze Sun, who shed light on the inventions, the impact, and the importance of the display.
The Tartan: Were all the quotes in reference to or inspired by religion and religious leaders? 
If so, what inspired that selection?
Sun: The quotes were all from different religions’ teachings. I asked for help from my friends 
when selecting these quotes. I wasn’t doing this project by myself. I was supported by INSPIRE 
(Interfaith Spirituality Embassy) and CORS (Consul of Religious Students). I’m an active member 
in both of them. During CORS’ meeting, we already had the idea of putting up signs around 
campus to raise campus’ awareness of students’ spiritual life, but we never set up a concrete 
plan. After the shooting, I thought putting up signs would be a perfect gesture to acknowledge 
the similarities between religions (how they value the same ideas and all advocate love), look 
for unity rather than separation, and use different religions’ beautiful teachings to console our 
campus. All teachings were about love, peace and unity.
Around 20 people came out and helped me to make those signs. The quotes were sent to me 
from the Jewish Student Association, Muslim Student Association, Catholic Newman Club, and 
representatives of Sikhism and the Baha’i faith. I really appreciate all the help and support I 
received.
The Tartan: What do you think should change in the campus community to better bring the 
messages from the signs to fruition?
Sun: When I put up the signs I actually doubted if my action was only preaching to the choir, 
because I believe that [Carnegie Mellon] already has a diverse and welcoming community. 
Apparently, the problem is the extremists outside of [Carnegie Mellon]—they should be learning 
about different cultures and religions.
But I took the action in making those signs because I was very dissatis?ed with our campus’ 
immediate reaction. I can’t generalize but a lot of my friends were moving on with their lives as 
usual. Some of them even argued in a very logical way that since they couldn’t really change the 
politics, there’s no use in doing anything. I was completely disturbed by this kind of reactions. 
I want those signs to be a reminder of what happened more than anything else. I don’t want 
students to simply move and let it pass. I hope the presence of these signs can prompt students to 
internalize this event in their own way.
People have different de?nitions of what kind of change is “useful.” I believe that all actions 
toward love is useful and should be appreciated. I cannot say what’s absolutely necessary to 
do. I am more willing to see all sorts of creative solutions coming from students with different 
backgrounds and diversi?ed skills. But I know that these solutions won’t appear if nobody’s 
internalizing what happened.
So to me, the beautiful messages on the signs were there to console anyone who was deeply 
impacted by the incident. But I hope the presence of those signs could change people’s individu-
alistic mindset—only concerning about their test scores and assignments when things like this 
happened— and help [Carnegie Mellon] students to be more aware of what’s happening in the 
greater community.
The Tartan: I think the simplicity of displaying the words to others in regards to abandoning 
hate is really interesting. What informed this decision?
Sun: I think subconsciously I believe that word is an extremely powerful thing—also why I 
chose Creative Writing as my major. But with all the academic stress I had, simplicity wasn’t a 
deliberate choice, it was more about what I can do. I know words bring me comforts when I need 
it, so I just want to bring them to our campus.
I didn’t plan to take the lead in something like this. But when I saw that a vast majority of the 
student body remained quiet, I knew I had to do something to show that injustice like this should 
be followed by actions, not silence.

determine the types of possible 
attacks, their consequences for the 
elections, and concrete steps to se-
cure these elections. One of these 
graduates, Will Cunha, a masters 
student who graduated in 2018, 
gave an interview to The Tartan 
where he re?ected on the impor-
tance and challenges of the project 
and discussed concrete steps that 
could be taken to secure our elec-
tions and learn more about this 
issue.
The importance and relevance 
of election security was the idea 
that gave birth to this capstone 
project. “[T]he timeliness of this 
topic and the sheer importance 
of it for the American people and 
democracy was something that, 
personally, drove me to the proj-
ect,” Cunha said. A fellow student 
on the team, Salvador Ayala, noted 
in the press release that “in four of 
the ?ve presidential elections since 
2000, the outcome was decided by 
less than 10 percent of total votes”, 
making the issue of securing the 
election process — especially in a 
swing state like Pennsylvania — 
even more critical.
With a team of four students 
and three months to complete the 
project, the primary challenge 
was narrowing down the scope. 
The initial research question was 
studying the election system in 
the entire country, which was too 
broad for their constraints, and 
was eventually narrowed down to 
Allegheny County.
The Allegheny County election 
data, however, was not always up 
to the task, as it was not always 
up-to-date. Another major limita-
tion with this research is that other 
counties have signi?cantly differ-
ent election systems, making their 
data model dif?cult to generalize 
beyond Allegheny County. “Unfor-
tunately, we were unable to obtain 
enough information about other 
counties in the time frame allot-
ted to test our model outside of 
Allegheny County,” Cunha said. “It 
took a lot of time to piece together 
the county-level processes from 
different sources, which is [a] rea-
son why our ?nal product focused 
only on Allegheny County.”
The team found that a swing 
state like Pennsylvania could be 
an attractive target to someone 
who wants to manipulate elec-
tion results. Because of the nar-
row margins of many election 
results in the state, “[b]y merely 
affecting 2 percent of votes cast, 
9 percent of statewide elections 
in Pennsylvania since 2000 could 
have been compromised in favor of 
the second-place candidate. And if 
an attack could affect 10 percent of 
the vote, that jumps to 68 percent 
of elections compromised,” noted 
the university press release.
The students said in the press 
release that a potential way a mali-
cious actor could compromise the 
election would be to legally buy 
voter registration data and merge 
it with personal data from the dark 
web, allowing him or her to change 
voter registrations and imperson-
ate registered voters. Even just 
the appearance of election attacks 
could sow mistrust in the election 
results among the voting popula-
tion, allowing a malicious actor to 
achieve his or her goals.
Based on their research, the 
team suggests ?ve short-term 
remedies that government of-
?cials should take to secure our 
votes before the next election, 
which Cunha outlined in an in-
terview with The Tartan. First, 
more money should be allocated 
towards mitigating the higher-
risk election vulnerabilities and 
preventing high-risk attacks. Sec-
ond, the authentication process 
for making changes to voter reg-
istration should be strengthened, 
which they identi?ed as one of the 
primary risks to election security 
in Allegheny County. Third, using 
paper printouts from personal 
electronic ballots (PEBs) during 
election audits would help with 
the certi?cation process until we 
upgrade to new machines that 
leave paper records. Fourth, poll 
workers should be trained on the 
vulnerabilities of and how to han-
dle sensitive items like PEBs. Fifth, 
there should be thorough back-
ground checks conducted on indi-
viduals who handle sensitive data.
Beyond the next election, 
Cunha and his teammates have 
more suggestions. Cunha says 
that legislation should be in place 
to speed up the security patch 
process for maintaining system 
security, without unnecessary 
bureaucratic oversight slowing it 
down. “While the State must cur-
rently re-certify software before 
system patches can be applied, 
changing this constricting legis-
lation to allow thoroughly vetted 
patches without an additional, 
bureaucratic certi?cation process 
would eliminate many techni-
cal vulnerabilities more expedi-
tiously,” Cunha stated. Cunha also 
stated the importance of paper 
auditing to the security process, as 
well as the principle of least privi-
lege — i.e., giving insider roles the 
minimum access needed to per-
form the role, which can alleviate 
insider threats.
In the future, Cunha and his 
teammates hope to see a part-
nership between the Allegheny 
County Division of Elections and 
Heinz College. “Heinz College has 
an enormous amount of exper-
tise and resources available to it 
and leveraging those resources, 
especially including the larger 
Carnegie Mellon University eco-
system, could bring a great deal of 
knowledge to leadership to help 
improve the election processes at 
the county and state level.”
a list of demands, it was not a 
student bill of rights, and it was 
not a policy.” Dr. Commer con-
tinued, “The kind of future we 
envisioned was something that 
could only come about through 
careful engagement and build-
ing with others.”
Though President Farnam 
Jahanian was scheduled to 
speak, he was not able to attend 
due doctor-recommended rest 
after a knee surgery. Neverthe-
less, Dr. Commer commended 
Jahanian’s support and “willing-
ness to see this [plan] through” 
in his time as Provost, when the 
Strategic Plan was just getting 
off the ground.
Interim Provost Laurie 
Weingart spoke in Jahanian’s 
place. She emphasized that the 
GSA recently received the Na-
tional Association of Graduate 
and Professional Students’ 2018 
Northeast member of the year 
award for outstanding work in 
representing Carnegie Mellon’s 
graduate and professional stu-
dents. Weingart praised, “We 
de?nitely have seen your hard 
work in action.”
“In the past year,” Weingart 
continued, “CMU GSA has be-
come a national voice in the 
national conversation on im-
migration and tax reform.” The 
Carnegie Mellon GSA has been 
pushing for a federal reform of 
the F-1 visa program that would 
enable students to re-validate 
their F-1 visas while remain-
ing in the United States. Earlier 
this year, along with 53 other 
University GSAs, they submit-
ted a letter to the State Depart-
ment. Though they received a 
response last month, the issue 
remains unresolved.
Other accomplishments of 
the GSA’s efforts include the 
opening of a Graduate Student 
Lounge in 2016 and the estab-
lishment of Legal Consultation 
Services. Plenty of Graduate 
students and live off campus 
and have no legal recourse with 
their landlords. Partnering with 
the Provost’s of?ce and the 
Undergraduate Senate, GSA 
started a program to provide 
free 20 minute legal consulta-
tions. Over 50 students have 
attended consultations this 
semester.
There is still a lot of work to 
do. In the coming year the GSA 
plans to continue advocating for 
better ?nancial aid and assis-
tance, especially for internation-
al students — for whom none 
exists. They are also looking to 
ensure that the transportation 
services and healthcare plans 
being offered by the university 
actually meet the needs of stu-
dents. Additionally, they will 
continue to push for the estab-
lishment of childcare services, 
something that was proposed 
over 25 years ago. Many gradu-
ate students have trouble ?nd-
ing affordable childcare services 
for their families, while other 
Universities like MIT, Stanford 
and Cornell already have similar 
programs established.
Surya Aggarwal, GSA 
President, thought the meeting 
was productive. “Beyond the 
formal remarks, a lot of conver-
sation happened and connec-
tions were made where we iden-
ti?ed the unachieved aspects of 
the strategic plan so we can get 
moving on them.” An important 
takeaway was that the admin-
istration recognizes the impor-
tance of the GSA Strategic Plan, 
but “we need to do more to get 
it moving,” voiced Aggarwal. 
“Obviously a lot has been done, 
but we’d like to see continued 
action.”

During his inauguration on Oct. 
26, President Farnam Jahanian 
announced that Carnegie Mellon 
received a large donation pledge 
of $50 million dollars from alumni 
Tod and Cindy Johnson.
The Johnsons, who graduated 
from Carnegie Mellon in 1966 
and 1968 respectively, made this 
pledge speci?cally with student 
aid in mind. The funds will be 
used for scholarships and persis-
tence services to help students 
succeed during their college 
career. Their scholarship gift is the 
largest one that the university has 
ever received.
Tod Johnson said in a Carnegie 
Mellon press release, “This is a gift 
that Cindy and I have always want-
ed to make. I see the societal and 
social effects of student debt in the 
lives of recent graduates whom my 
company hires and through our 
company’s research on consumer 
spending; it is becoming more ap-
parent than ever before...we hope 
that this gift makes it possible for 
many more students to choose 
Carnegie Mellon without taking 
on a ?nancial burden.”
Tod is the executive chairman 
of the NPD Group, Inc., a market-
research ?rm, and he is also the 
current vice chair of Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Board of 
Trustees. He was the leader of the 
Presidential Search Committee 
that appointed President Jaha-
nian.
The Johnson Family 
Scholarship Endowment will be 
used to meet the ?nancial needs 
of both current and prospective 
undergraduate students. The aid 
will be particularly impactful for 
low- and middle-income students.
Dean of Admission Michael 
Steidel believes that the 
endowment will help alleviate the 
stress that families face in paying 
for education. He said, in the same 
press release “interest in Carnegie 
Mellon from students around the 
world continues to grow at an 
extraordinary pace, which we saw 
with a 19 percent increase in ap-
plicants last year. But prospective 
students and their families tell us 
the number one obstacle is the 
cost of attendance. Scholarship 
support like that made possible 
through the Johnsons’ tremen-
dous generosity gives us the tools 
to help more of these talented 
students say ‘yes’ to CMU, their 
top choice.”
In addition to student scholar-
ships, this contribution from the 
Johnsons will provide Carnegie 
Mellon with the ?nancial ?ex-
ibility needed to accommodate 
students who leave the university 
without completing their degrees, 
due to personal con?icts and 
issues.
Speaking to the motivation 
behind the pledge, Cindy Johnson 
explained that she and Tod want-
ed to support students as they 
begin their lives, just as Carnegie 
Mellon supported them when they 
were undergraduates. “Carnegie 
Mellon has meant so much to Tod 
and me from our very ?rst days as 
undergraduates,” Johnson said. 
“Financial aid played a key role as 
we began our lives together, and 
we look forward to many genera-
tions of students seeing how their 
world opens up because of some-
thing so simple yet important as a 
scholarship.”
The Johnsons met when they 
were students at Carnegie Institute 
of Technology and married while 
they were both still enrolled in 
the university. Carnegie Insti-
tute of Technology became Carn-
egie Mellon University while they 
were students. Tod ?rst received a 
bachelor’s degree in graphic arts 
management in 1966 and went on 
to earn a master’s degree in indus-
trial administration in 1967. Cindy 
earned her bachelor’s degree in 
art in 1968.
During his speech, President 
Jahanian spoke about the role 
that education plays in changing 
people’s lives, and he expressed 
his gratitude toward the John-
sons. Jahanian said, “A Carnegie 
Mellon education and the unique 
experience our students gain 
during their time here is nothing 
short of life-changing. Especially 
at this time of societal transfor-
mation brought on by advances in 
technology, the world needs more 
CMU graduates who are prepared 
to lead this transition. We are 
awestruck by Cindy and Tod’s gen-
erosity and thrilled at how their 
support will greatly expand our 
ability to ensure a CMU education 
is within reach of all students.”

America must respect, not glorify, our veterans
Across America, bumper 
stickers proudly proclaim 
“Support Our Troops.” People 
stand up at sports games to honor 
the veterans in the crowd. Every 
Veterans Day, Facebook timelines 
explode in a cacophony of red, 
white, and blue. Pithy political 
comics use injured veterans 
to mock those who question 
the army. In some cases, the 
word “veteran” has become 
synonymous with “hero.”
The United States claims to 
adore its military and veterans, 
and recent events have only 
reinforced this claim. According 
to The Washington Post, there was 
a public outcry when Saturday 
Night Live (SNL) made a joke at 
the expense of Dan Crenshaw, “a 
former Navy SEAL and the newly 
elected Republican representative 
from Texas’s 2nd Congressional 
District.”
A little background: Crenshaw 
wears an eye patch because he lost 
his eye to an improvised explosive 
device in Afghanistan on his 
third combat tour. During the 
“Weekend Update” segment, SNL 
comedian Pete Davidson made a 
couple cracks at his appearance, 
including a comparison to a “hit 
man in a porno movie.” After the 
episode aired, both Democrats 
and Republicans demanded an 
apology on behalf of all veterans. 
SNL, usually unapologetic in its 
satire, complied. The next episode 
showed Davidson making an in-
person apology to Crenshaw.
At around the same time, 
there was another veteran-
related ?asco, this time centered 
on President Trump. According 
to The Huf?ngton Post, Trump 
skipped a visit to the Aisne-Marne 
American cemetery, the resting 
place of almost 2,000 American 
soldiers killed in World War I. 
He claimed that the weather 
prevented the visit, prompting 
hundreds of pictures on Twitter of 
other politicians giving speeches 
in the rain. A few days later, he 
made another blunder when he 
failed to go to Arlington National 
Cemetery on Veterans Day. His 
excuse was that he was “busy on 
calls for the country.” Predictably, 
this excuse also generated 
backlash.
These uproars, and similar 
ones throughout history, prove 
that Americans are quick to 
defend their hallowed veterans. 
But while there are heroic people 
in the military, the widespread 
adulation of its members can be 
troublesome.
America’s adulation of 
veterans and military personnel is 
not a benign social phenomenon. 
First, it allows bad apples to 
thrive and spread their rot. In 
the National Review, a former 
major says that “though I’ve seen 
heroism in the military, I’ve also 
seen craven corruption, cynical 
exploitation of the public, and 
grotesque incompetence.” He 
continues to say that deference 
and awe should be earned, and 
the mere act of donning a uniform 
is not enough. Treating military 
members like saints creates 
fertile ground for scandals and 
exploitation.
Second, military worship 
obfuscates the harm of U.S. 
imperialism. Despite what 
millions of school children have 
been taught, the army is not 
always ?ghting for our freedom. 
The government has its own 
interests, and it has been known 
to use the military as a weapon 
through tactics like drone strikes 
and bombings, leaving torn 
countries and shattered families 
in its wake. If we call every single 
member of the military a hero, 
we do a great disservice to the 
victims of U.S. imperialism and 
collateral damage.
Finally, military worship 
doesn’t actually do anything to 
help struggling veterans. Veterans 
need better treatment and a more 
ef?cient Department of Veterans 
Affairs. They need tangible laws 
and policies. They need dedicated 
and highly trained support 
networks. They de?nitely do 
not need empty praise. In other 
words, you can slap as many 
American ?ag ?lters on your 
pro?le picture as you want, but 
it means nothing if you still avoid 
eye contact with the homeless 
veteran sitting on the sidewalk 
outside your of?ce.
If we want to improve our 
military, we must take a moment 
to realize simply vocalizing our 
praises to veterans is not enough. 
If we want to help people suffering 
from U.S. imperialism, let’s begin 
to ask ourselves how to move 
past the aftermath. If we want 
to help veterans themselves, let’s 
help create policies to support 
them. There is a difference 
between reverence and respect, 
and moving from the former to 
the latter is not a disgrace; it’s 
necessary.

On Nov. 6, DEFY Media 
suddenly closed its doors, 
leaving many of its employees 
and YouTubers who relied on 
them for revenue in the dark. 
A multi-channel network that 
struck contracts with numerous 
YouTubers, DEFY promised 
consistent payment. This was 
especially relevant for content 
creators suffering from YouTube’s 
draconian demonetization 
policies, which continue to leave 
ad revenue an unreliable source 
of income.
The closure was a shock to 
several people, as DEFY had 
several powerhouse brands like 
Smosh and Clevver, along with 
$70 million worth of investments 
from two years ago. There were 
some warning signs, such as DEFY 
laying off eight percent of its staff 
and closing its programming 
advertising business in March, 
as well as selling Screen Junkies 
in July. Since the closure of 
the company, YouTubers such 
as Chris Stuckmann have 
come out and shared their 
experience, discussing the 
suffocating contracts, failed 
payments of due ad revenue, 
and lack of compensation for 
sponsored videos. Anthony 
Padilla questioned how the 
company could somehow burn 
through their $70 million worth 
of investments, saying that he 
only ever saw “a fraction of that 
money” himself.
The reason I am bringing up 
the entire situation with DEFY 
is that it’s another reminder of 
just how incorporated YouTube 
has become. It’s gone from a hub 
for video sharing and original 
content to a cynical platform that 
adheres to executive goals and 
business interests. The trending 
page is now full of talk shows, 
music videos, top ten lists, and the 
rare content that YouTube deems 
as advertiser-friendly, which 
formerly included Logan Paul.
The reason ad revenue has 
been unreliable for YouTubers is 
due to the “adpocalpyse.” This 
situation arose when PewDiePie 
had a series of controversial, anti-
Semitic videos picked up by news 
outlets, who showed how these 
sorts of comments were being 
monetized. As a result of this, 
several advertisers pulled their 
ads, and YouTube began making 
less money.
The problem is that this is a 
loss for everyone. For advertisers, 
they lost a signi?cant audience, 
because a lot of young people use 
YouTube (and don’t know what 
Adblock is). For YouTube, they 
lost a lot of money due to less ad 
revenue. But YouTubers faced 
the worst of it, seeing much less 
income than before and no longer 
being able to have a consistent 
revenue stream. This pushed 
YouTubers to turn to alternate 
platforms such as Kickstarter, 
Patreon, and sponsored videos, 
or else to sign with multi-channel 
networks like DEFY in order to 
have a stable income.
It’s ironic that YouTubers had 
to sign contracts with another 
corporation so that they could 
make money on the platform of 
a different corporation. Google 
and YouTube’s job is to be the 
middleman between content 
creators and advertisers. They 
have to keep the interests of 
both in mind and come up with 
the ideal solution to satisfy both. 
The issue is that YouTube took 
the route of punishing content 
creators instead. Their new 
monetization system is full of 
vague phrases, such as ?agging 
“sensitive” or “sensational” 
content. With the implementation 
of this system, many YouTubers 
have faced the issue of their 
videos being demonetized 
regularly. This was combined 
with companies ?agging several 
videos for copyright claims, 
despite the fact that all of the 
videos they ?agged were valid 
under fair use. While YouTube has 
a system for disputing copyright 
claims, the fact that they let 
companies take down videos at 
will is troubling. YouTube also 
had a system where they allowed 
some content creators to be part 
of their exclusive ad revenue 
program. Through this program, 
these YouTubers were guaranteed 
consistent ad revenue, but it was 
really only for large YouTubers like 
Logan Paul (whose suicide forest 
video wasn’t even demonetized at 
?rst).
There are straightforward 
solutions to all these problems. 
For starters, make it clear that 
putting an advertisement on 
a video does not equate to 
sponsoring said video. The 
whole point of advertising is for 
companies to let people gain 
exposure to the product they’re 
selling. They shouldn’t care about 
what the content of the video is. 
If companies do care about the 
content, then YouTube should put 
in an extensive opt-out system for 
what types of content or speci?c 
videos companies don’t want their 
ads to be playing on. This will 
solve the issue of demonetization 
entirely, and YouTube will only 
need that system for serious 
violations of their community 
guidelines. YouTube should also 
protect their content creators 
by actively creating better rules 
about when companies are 
allowed to make copyright claims. 
Finally, they should compensate 
all the YouTubers who have been 
unfairly treated by DEFY and have 
lost a lot of money due to not 
being paid before the company’s 
shutdown, and YouTube needs to 
have a better system in place to 
prevent multi-channel networks 
from exploiting YouTubers.
YouTube shouldn’t even call 
it “community guidelines” at 
this point. They should just call 
it “corporate conduct.” Take a 
look at YouTube rewinds over the 
years and you can see how it’s 
gone from being focused on its 
content creators, to being focused 
on the models and trends that are 
attractive to the shareholders. 
It’s an unhealthy direction that 
won’t change anytime soon, 
since there is no reason for 
YouTube to stop. They now have 
a premium subscription service 
and are starting their own original 
content, clearly trying to compete 
with companies like Net?ix and 
Hulu. For YouTubers, it’s wishful 
thinking at this point that YouTube 
would honor its roots as a content 
sharing platform.

Intellectual Dark Web creates space for controversial voices
FRANK HU
Assistant Forum Editor
When you hear about the 
“dark web,” you probably think 
about the seedy underbelly of 
the internet where anonymous 
individuals circulate disturbing 
videos and images, contract 
killers advertise their services, 
and drug dealers peddle their 
goods for cryptocurrency.
What you probably don’t think 
about is a bunch of prominent 
?gures of industry and academia 
gathering over dinner to discuss 
ideas that are deemed, by 
today’s standards, controversial 
like the fundamental biological 
differences between men and 
women, the constricting of 
Free Speech, and the dangers 
of identity politics. These are, 
coincidentally, a lot of the 
topics that we would brand as 
“conservative” ideas, ones that 
have fallen out of favor in the face 
of the rising tide of liberalism.
The Intellectual Dark Web 
— the name ?rst coined by 
managing director of Thiel 
Capital Eric Weinstein — helps 
keep those ideas alive, isolating 
their discourse from the 
mainstream where they would 
be met with ?erce backlash 
and opposition. Composed of 
powerful individuals such as Sam 
Harris, Dave Rubin, and Claire 
Lehmann, members of the dark 
web see themselves as vanguards 
in a war against the oppressive 
notion of political correctness, 
championing traditional values 
that continue to clash with the 
present.
The very fact that this splinter 
group exists is quite telling 
of the state of our politically 
polarized society, and it only 
goes to show just how divided our 
nation has become. However, as 
questionable as the Intellectual 
Dark Web might sound, it’s not 
necessarily a bad thing.
It’s undeniable that with 
the growing focus on political 
correctness and sensitivity 
towards one another, topics 
that were once considered 
fair game have been labeled 
as inappropriate. Whoever 
dares to discuss these subjects 
are targeted for censorship 
or ostracization, as we saw in 
the case of YouTube censoring 
PragerU, a conservative media 
outlet. Since then, other social 
media platforms have come 
under increasing pressure to take 
an active role in censoring their 
content, especially in the wake 
of tragedies like the Pittsburgh 
shooting.
The problem with this 
systematic elimination of 
controversial voices is that just 
because they are kicked off 
popular platforms does not mean 
they won’t go somewhere else 
and continue their conversation. 
Luckily, the Intellectual Dark 
Web is just a group interested 
in civil discourse surrounding 
conservative ideals, which is a 
lot better than platforms like Gab 
which allows for the blossoming 
of hate speech.
So how can the Intellectual 
Dark Web be a good thing?
The greatest bene?t that comes 
from the dark web is that they 
preserve ideas that otherwise 
don’t come up. This is important 
because it keeps an active debate 
going, and while many may not 
agree with their perspectives, it’s 
a lot better to have a discussion of 
opposing values than to have one 
universal set of values imposed 
upon everyone. To do so would 
be a disservice to the diversity of 
mankind, something that we are 
all keen to celebrate and revel 
in. After all, everyone should be 
free to express themselves. As the 
old saying goes, “I disapprove of 
what you say, but I will defend to 
the death your right to say it.”
The broader problem is 
that these controversial ideas 
have been used by some as 
justi?cations for hate crimes and 
hate speech, which sometimes 
leads to legitimate harm. The 
ideas in of themselves are 
innocuous, but because they have 
become associated with domestic 
terrorism, they are similarly 
denounced as dangerous.
Continuously rede?ning the 
mainstream with successively 
narrower boundaries in hopes 
of snuf?ng out hate speech will 
never work, because practitioners 
of evil will always ?nd some 
workaround. Instead, we need to 
become more precise with who 
and what we are blaming rather 
than making indiscriminate 
blanket statements. As the dark 
web proves, there are those 
out there who are interested in 
investigating controversial ideas 
solely for intellectual reasons.
While it’s good that the dark 
web continues to preserve these 
taboo topics, the fact that they 
view and brand themselves as 
ideological pariahs operating 
on the outskirts of the national 
conversation is not quite as 
commendable. Rather than 
working at the fringes, the dark 
web should ?nd more constructive 
ways to discuss their ideas with 
the opposing side instead of 
playing the victim. This concept 
of leaving each other alone is 
quite un-American given how our 
country was founded upon the 
principles of collaboration for the 
common good.
Whether or not the Intellectual 
Dark Web will continue to hide 
in the shadows or come forward 
into the light is their prerogative. 
Regardless, it’s good to know 
that there are those interested 
in looking at conservative and 
controversial subjects in an 
intellectual capacity, and there 
is little cause for concern so 
long as they steer away from 
weaponizing their ideology 
towards ulterior motives.
Recently Carnegie Mellon 
University paid $17 million for the 
Fifth Neville apartment building at 
4705 Fifth Avenue. This property 
is adjacent to the Yi Chung Kwan 
Korean grocery store and across 
from the Residence on Fifth. 
Carnegie Mellon made a good 
investment move that helps address 
their shortfall of units, but I have 
a few problems regarding this 
acquisition that should prompt 
concern from both Carnegie Mellon 
students and staff.
The Post-Gazette reports that 
everyone must move out after 
their lease is ?nished and thus 
buying out this building is an act 
of displacement. Moving out of an 
apartment is dif?cult, especially 
when tenants expect to live in the 
same residence. Now that tenants 
are told they cannot ?nish their 
lease, they have to deal with the 
stress of looking for a new home 
and, especially for lower-income 
tenants, the fear of homelessness.
Carnegie Mellon, as an 
institution and landlord, can 
alleviate the problems caused by 
displacement by offering support 
to tenants. Support can be any of 
the following: ?nancial assistance, 
resources to ?nd new housing, no 
penalty for early lease termination, 
and communicating with tenants 
during and after the lease to ensure 
everything proceeded smoothly. 
By offering support, Carnegie 
Mellon can be a leader in the city 
of Pittsburgh for what tenants can 
expect and how landlords should 
treat tenants when displacement 
happens. At the least, I would hope, 
and eventually come to expect, that 
landlords to offer the type of support 
mentioned and kudos to Carnegie 
Mellon if they are engaging in some 
of these good neighbor policies 
already.
Students at Carnegie Mellon 
should pay attention to the rent of 
the Fifth and Neville apartments 
after the university ?nishes 
renovating the buildings. Right now, 
the two single-bedroom apartments 
available in the building go for 
$1,300 a month. University housing 
rent tends to be slightly above market 
rate. If the rent increases, then that 
means more money for students 
and fewer market-rate apartments 
available for both students and for 
the people of Pittsburgh. As students 
who already spend an inordinate 
amount of money on tuition and 
housing, we should encourage our 
university to be frugal and ef?cient 
with our money.
I anticipate Carnegie Mellon will 
continue to buy out properties in the 
Oakland area to accommodate their 
housing need. I encourage students 
and staff to set a precedent and ask 
the university to support the people 
they displace and implement rent 
control measures to save students 
money. I plan to take my concerns 
stated in this op-ed to Housing 
Services, and I encourage the reader 
to do the same.

LETTER TO THE EDITOR: CMU’S OBLIGATIONS TO DISPLACED TENANTS
EMMA FLICKINGER
SciTech Editor
If you aren’t living under a 
rock, or possibly in the basement 
of Porter, you won’t ?nd it hard 
to believe that the humanities are 
undervalued at Carnegie Mellon. 
We’ve all heard the jokes about 
Dietrich. We’ve all seen students 
forced to meet humanities 
requirements skim the course 
list with a resentful eye and a 
“let’s-get-this-over-with” attitude, 
gravitating toward the classes that 
seem low-effort. You might even 
be one of those students.
Even in an of?cial capacity — 
think press releases and mailers 
to prospective students — the 
humanities only get noticed 
in interdisciplinary work, in 
conjunction with a scienti?c or 
technical component. Plenty of 
students on campus don’t care 
who Francis Bacon was or what he 
did, but could probably name the 
English department’s “Six Degrees 
of Francis Bacon” project as one of 
the university’s favorite examples 
of interdisciplinary innovation.
That’s not to say that 
that project isn’t incredibly 
cool (because it is!) or that 
interdisciplinary work doesn’t 
deserve the attention it gets. It’s 
just that the humanities only seem 
to be celebrated in conjunction 
with work in science, technology, 
engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM). Exploration and analysis 
of the human experience appear 
unimportant. Only when history, 
English, and modern languages 
are associated with statistics, 
psychology, engineering, 
computer science are they good 
enough.
It goes without saying that the 
reverse is totally unimaginable.
What’s less obvious is that, 
even within Dietrich itself, the 
humanities take a back seat to 
the social sciences. On Carnegie 
Mellon’s admissions website, 
Dietrich bills itself as “no ordinary 
liberal arts college.” What does 
that mean, really? If you think 
about it for more than ?ve seconds 
it look bad from every angle, like 
an institutional-level I’m not like 
other girls.
Career events and job 
newsletters billed as “especially 
for Dietrich undergrads!” promise 
a break from endless lists of tech 
startups looking for software 
engineers. Instead, we get 
consulting ?rms looking to hire 
data analysts from the statistics 
department. Celebrations of 
Dietrich student work usually 
take the form of poster sessions, 
and inviting all students to 
participate regardless of major 
won’t change the fact that posters 
are a traditional medium of 
the scienti?c realm (and that 
it’s fundamentally easier for a 
decision science student to present 
their experimental research on 
a poster than it is for a creative 
writing student to show off their 
poetry).
If, for a second, we accept 
the premise that the humanities 
rarely get shout-outs on their own 
because the university’s favorite 
projects are interdisciplinary, then 
maybe this extends to Dietrich, 
too. After all, as Pres. Jahanian 
acknowledged recently in an 
interview with The Tartan, the 
university really does want to 
focus on interdisciplinary work.
It might not be fair to 
make claims from the outside 
about what image Dietrich’s 
administration wants to promote, 
interdisciplinary or otherwise. 
That said, Dietrich’s ‘about’ page 
begins: “The Dietrich College is 
home to faculty and students who 
often cross disciplines to solve 
real-world problems.”
We can also look through 
the university press releases 
Dietrich shares on its website: 
on an informal count, Dietrich’s 
site displays 31 interdisciplinary 
news stories from 2018, versus 23 
focused on the humanities. Maybe 
it isn’t about prioritizing the social 
sciences over the humanities 
after all: it’s about showing that 
collaboration is the future of both, 
that we are greater than the sum 
of our parts, and that neither the 
social sciences nor the humanities 
— but the combination of core 
concepts from both disciplines — 
are what makes Dietrich special.
Except there were 39 Dietrich 
press releases in 2018 that focused 
exclusively on departments 
in the social sciences, largely 
psychology and statistics, the 
most sciencey of all. That’s more 
than interdisciplinary topics, 
and almost twice as many as the 
humanities. This might have 
something to do with the relative 
size of the departments (for 
example, the recently rechristened 
Department of Statistics and Data 
Science is one of the university’s 
fastest growing programs). Except 
if we’re still assuming that the 
number of press releases on a 
given topic roughly corresponds 
to the public image Dietrich 
wants to construct... the size of 
the department shouldn’t matter. 
So is the administration playing 
favorites, or just not making an 
effort?
Two new undergraduate 
minors in Dietrich — 
Environmental and Sustainability 
Studies, and Humanities Analytics 
— got plenty of hype from the 
university on campus and on social 
media when they were recently 
introduced, in accordance with 
the focus on forward-thinking 
interdisciplinary studies. Another 
shiny new interdisciplinary 
program, the Master of Arts 
in Global Communication and 
Applied Translation, didn’t even 
get a press release. Is it because 
the collaborating departments are 
English and Modern Languages? 
(“Six Degrees of Francis Bacon,” 
by the way, has had three press 
releases all to itself in the past few 
years.)
Am I just bitter? Maybe. More 
than that, though, I’m concerned 
about what messages humanities 
students are receiving about 
the value of their work and the 
students outside the humanities 
who aren’t shown anything that 
contradicts their preconceived 
notions. The university may not 
have created the campus culture 
that dismisses the intrinsic value 
of the humanities, but for now, it’s 
complicit.

Science did not corrupt society; 
society corrupted science.
This was the key takeaway 
from Dr. Eric Herschthal’s talk 
“Frederick Douglass On Science: 
What He Said, Why He Said It, 
And What He Thought It Ought To 
Be,” which he delivered last Tues-
day in Porter Hall. Dr. Herschthal, 
who holds a PhD in history from 
Columbia University, specializes 
in the study of African American 
history and the role that science 
played in shaping the dynamics of 
slavery and emancipation, as well 
as its impact on the society of post-
slavery America. While Douglass 
is not the focus of his research — 
rather, one of many characters in 
an elaborate narrative — Dr. Her-
schthal decided to center the talk 
around Douglass be-
cause the abolition-
ist had a very com-
plex relationship 
with scienti?c inquiry.
Like many fugitive 
slaves who escaped to the 
North, Douglass was not 
free from the shadow of prej-
udice and racism. It was there 
that he was introduced to the 
two intellectual realms that 
he would continue to grapple 
with for the rest of his life: ra-
cial science and technology.
To Douglass, technology 
went hand-in-hand with free-
dom. As opposed to the South-
ern economy that revolved 
around slave labor, the North 
depended on technological 
innovations such as pulley 
systems and steam engines to 
do the heavy lifting. This stark 
contrast was not lost upon 
Douglass, who remarked that 
while the South persevered as 
a collection of slave states, the 
North was moving forward, more 
concerned with economy.
While he disagreed that tech-
nology alone could solve the issues 
of slavery (white anti slavery sym-
pathizers often posited the idea as 
a “technological ?x” for slavery), 
Douglass believed that it was 
important for black individuals 
to receive technical training so 
that as the world advanced, they 
would not be left behind. To that 
end, he advocated for the creation 
of schools such as the Douglass 
Institute where African Americans 
could not only study, but also 
become con?dent in their own 
intelligence.
How Douglass fought the tide 
of racial science was the most in-
teresting point of Dr. Herschthal’s 
talk. Racial science in the 1800s 
revolved around theories like 
phrenology and craniology, where 
many believed you could discern 
someone’s personality and intel-
ligence by feeling the bumps on 
their skulls. These techniques 
were leveraged towards main-
taining white supremacy 
and denigrating non-white 
populations, giving birth to 
some of the most debasing 
and ethnocentric publica-
tions of the age in the pro-
cess. These views clashed 
harshly with Douglass’s 
principle that all people were 
created equal, and that any 
differences arose from their 
environment.
The inaccurate and offensive 
claims of these journals prompt-
ed many abolitionists 
to openly 
criticize the authors, and while 
Douglass was tempted to join in, 
he decided to debate those whose 
views he 
disagreed with. Douglass saw 
nothing would be accomplished by 
calling each other names; refuting 
science with more science was the 
only way, and he followed through 
with this approach in public fo-
rums and his own writings. 
Many of the things that 
Douglass said may 
sound crude and 
racist by mod-
ern standards, 
but his goal 
was not to 
undermine 
the estab-
lished scien-
ti?c thought. 
Rather, he 
hoped to curtail 
the spread of scien-
ti?c inaccuracies inso-
far as they did not 
impede his po-
litical argu-
ments.
It was racial science that 
sparked con?ict within Douglass. 
Clinging to enlightenment ideals, 
Douglass believed that science, if 
used properly, could help liberate 
all of mankind, and it astounded 
him how knowledge was used for 
nefarious purposes under the pre-
tense of objectivity. Despite the 
challenges involved, Douglass still 
maintained the importance of en-
gaging with science and mastering 
it, believing that banishing igno-
rance was the only way to achieve 
true emancipation.
Dr. Herschthal painted a picture 
of a humble and brilliant man who 
looked past the barriers of color 
and race, holding onto unbridled 
enthusiasm for the transformative 
power of science. Rather than 
shun science, Douglass embraced 
it, and encouraged others to do so 
as well.
After his presentation, there 
was a brief Q&A session during 
which Dr. Herschthal connected 
Douglass’s ideas to the present 
moment. In response to the ques-
tion “what would Douglass say 
about our society right now,” 
Herschthal connected the 21st 
century with the 19th cen-
tury by showing how the 
same problems continue 
to persist, albeit in novel 
and complex ways. Mak-
ing it abundantly clear 
that he was not quali?ed 
to speak for Douglass, 
Herschthal speculated 
that despite all that has 
changed in the last 200 
years, Douglass would 
continue with the same 
core message. It was in-
credible to see that even 
though we are nearing 
the 200th anniversary 
of Douglass’s birth, 
his ideas are more 
relevant than ever in our 
sociopolitical climate.
It’s important to realize 
that science and technol-
ogy do not exist in their own 
little bubbles. As researchers and 
thinkers and scholars that live 
and operate in the real world, we 
have to recognize that our work 
has consequences for every other 
sector of society, and it’s impor-
tant to recognize how we ?t into 
the broader puzzle to ensure that 
we leverage the power of our 
innovations for the common good 
of humanity. In this way, we can 
one day achieve Douglass’s vision 
of the elevation of all mankind, 
regardless of color and creed.

The familiar is often 
overlooked. A recent paper 
published in the journal 
Science Advances describes 
a newly-discovered prop-
erty of double layers of 
graphene that may make 
it possible to turn the 
material into a super-
conductor. The system 
has been studied before, 
because it is also a semi-
conductor with a band 
gap, but never with instru-
ments sensitive enough to 
recognize the necessary 
properties for supercon-
ductivity. “It is an overseen 
property of a well-studied 
system,” said ?rst author 
Dr. Dmitry Marchenko.
There are many differ-
ent allotropes, or forms, 
of pure carbon, depending 
on how the atoms formed 
bonds. Some familiar allo-
tropes include diamonds, 
graphite, and carbon 
nanotubes. Graphene is a 
2-dimensional form of car-
bon, in which the atoms 
are arranged in a hexago-
nal crystal lattice. Graph-
ite does conduct electricity 
well in normal conditions 
— but it is not a supercon-
ductor.
In a normal conduct-
ing material, the moving 
electrons will collide with 
the ions in the material’s 
lattice. These collisions 
will take some of the elec-
trons’ energy and con-
vert it to heat, which is 
the source of electrical 
resistance. All supercon-
ductors, however, have 
zero resistivity; the elec-
trons can ?ow without 
interference. This means 
that superconductors 
can theoretically main-
tain a current inde?nitely 
without degradation, as 
well as support extremely 
high currents without suf-
fering signi?cant losses to 
heat. Researchers at MIT

Graphene may be the ultimate conductor
SEAN MIN
Staffwriter
Haotian Wang, a fellow at 
Harvard University’s Rowland 
Institute, and his team have 
recently detailed improvements 
they made to a system they ?rst 
outlined in 2017. This system was 
already capable of reducing car-
bon dioxide into carbon monox-
ide, a reactant commonly used in a 
variety of industrial processes, but 
the the team has made it drasti-
cally more practical and effective.
Wang, who is slated to join Rice 
University as an assistant professor 
of chemical and biomolecular 
engineering, has developed a series 
of small reactors which help cata-
lyze various greenhouse gases into 
carbon monoxide, by using single 
atoms of nickel. In the research 
paper, Wang describes his plan to 
connect his system to power plants 
or other industrial sites which emit 
a great deal of pollutants. Since 
carbon dioxide makes up about 20 
percent of these pollutants, Wang 
hopes it could one day be pumped 
into his system and converted into 
useful chemicals when combined 
with clean electricity.
The old system was roughly 
as large as a cell phone and con-
sisted of two electrodes in two 
electrolyte-?lled chambers. The 
new system is far smaller – a mere 
10-by-10 centimeter cell. It is also 
far more ef?cient; as much as four 
liters of carbon monoxide per hour 
can be emitted from this type of 
cell. Rather than electrodes and 
electrolyte-?lled chambers, the 
new system instead relies on enor-
mous concentrations of water va-
por and carbon dioxide. Cost and 
scalability were the main issues 
with the old system, but Wang says 
the new system addresses these 
issues.
“The support we were using 
to anchor single nickel atoms was 
based on graphene, which made it 
dif?cult to scale up if you wanted 
to produce it at gram or even ki-
logram scale for 
practical use in 
the future,” 
says Wang. Gra-
phene is prohibi-
tively expensive, 
which is why Wang’s 
team made the decision to 
switch to carbon black instead. 
Carbon black is thousands of 
times cheaper than graphene but 
anchors nickel atoms almost as 
effectively. Positively charged 
nickel atoms can be absorbed

have found superconductivity 
in graphene bilayers before, but 
their system required the two ?at 
lattices to be twisted precisely 1.1 
degrees relative to each other. 
Other successful attempts at 
turning graphene into a super-
conductor have necessitated add-
ing other metals, which limits the 
material’s capabilities at higher 
temperatures. While an exciting 
development, there is limited 
potential for real-world applica-
tions, as the necessary conditions 
are challenging to manufacture 
in bulk.
Scientists at the Helmholtz-
Zentrum Berlin, however, 
recently published a paper that 
describes the properties of 
bilayer graphene in which the 
lattices lie exactly on top of each 
other. This system is suitable 
for larger-scale production; the 
material is produced by heat-
ing a silicon carbide crystal until 
the silicon atoms evaporate from 
the surface, leaving ?rst a single 
layer of graphene, then a second.
The researchers found a ?at 
area in the band structure, which 
is a prerequisite for superconduc-
tivity. Band theory approximates 
the quantum mechanical state of 
a solid, describing the ranges of 
possible energies for electrons 
in the material. In a ?at area, 
the energy level does not change 
with position. Angle-resolved 
photoemission spectroscopy 
(ARPES) is a direct method of 
studying the electronic struc-
ture of the surface of solids. The 
researchers in this study used an 
ARPES instrument with resolu-
tion high enough to ?nd the ?at 
area next to the band gap.
Superconductors are already 
being used in scienti?c and 
medical equipment, such as 
MRI machines, which need to 
generate large magnetic ?elds. 
Superconducting electromagnets 
are incredibly strong; the lack of 
resistance in the wire coils means 
that they can create strong mag-
netic ?elds by conducting much 
higher currents than their non-
superconducting counterparts, 
without losing any energy to 
heat.
There are many potential 
future applications of super-
conductors, including electric 
power transmission. Supercon-
ducting transmission lines would 
eliminate power transmission 
losses, which the U.S. Energy 
Information Administration esti-
mates to be around ?ve percent. 
This could increase the feasibility 
of renewable energy, which is 
often generated far from the pop-
ulations that use it.
In its existing form, graphene 
is an excellent conductor of elec-
tricity. Exploiting the property 
discovered by these researchers 
could produce the ultimate, pur-
est conductor with uses in every-
thing from solar power to water 
puri?cation.
“The most promising idea may be to 
connect these devices with coal-?red 
power plants or other industry that 
produces a lot of carbon dioxide.”

From CARBON, A7
into negatively charged defects 
in carbon black nanoparticles, 
resulting in an inexpensive 
material that is still highly selective 
for reduction of carbon dioxide.
According to Wang, the system 
currently in his laboratory can only 
produce several grams of carbon 
monoxide per batch. He claims 
that this is due to the synthesis 
equipment owned by Wang and 
his team; if someone utilized a 
larger tank instead, he speculates 
that “kilograms or even tons of this 
catalyst” could be produced.
A major issue Wang’s team 
encountered was that the old sys-
tem only functioned in a liquid so-
lution. The original system works 
by splitting water molecules into 
oxygen and protons in one cham-
ber, then allowing the oxygen to 
leave the chamber and the protons 
to move into the second chamber. 
In the second chamber, the pro-
tons bind with carbon dioxide with 
the assistance of the nickel cata-
lyst and break the carbon dioxide 
into carbon monoxide and water. 
This water is then driven back into 
the ?rst chamber. However, since 
the only carbon dioxide capable 
of being reduced is that which 
is dissolved in water, only trace 
amounts of carbon dioxide would 
actually be reduced. According to 
Wang, “most of the molecules sur-
rounding the catalyst were water.”
Wang’s team was unable to 
increase the voltage applied to 
nickel because that would likely 
cause water molecules to split 
instead. Thus, they eventually 
decided to take out the liquid 
water out of the system entirely 
and replaced it with water vapor. 
Since water vapor does not act as 
an ion conductor like liquid water 
does, Wang’s team can enormously 
increase the voltage and, in turn, 
the ef?ciency of the overall system. 
Ion exchange membranes take the 
place of the liquid water in moving 
ions in the chamber.
Although Wang’s team has 
already patched up many of the 
challenges faced by their original 
system, Wang believes that their 
main challenge concerns the sta-
bility of the system. The system 
can currently be run for tens of 
hours, but it has to be developed to 
a point where it can continuously 
operate for thousands of hours 
to have a tangible environmental 
or economic impact. In spite of 
this massive gap, Wang is con?-
dent that this goal will eventually 
become a reality through careful 
analysis of “both the carbon diox-
ide reaction catalyst and the water 
oxidation catalyst.”
In addition to their nickel-
based reactor, Wang and his team 
have developed copper-based 
systems dedicated to further 
reducing carbon dioxide. Carbon 
monoxide’s value is quite low 
compared to other products 
which can be acquired through 
further reduction, making these 
copper-based catalysts more ideal 
to produce even more valuable 
products.

Scientists have been 
attempting to decipher the 
origin of water on Earth 
for decades. A new study in 
the Journal of Geophysical 
Research: Planets of the 
American Geophysical 
Union puts forward a new 
theory towards resolving 
this mystery, suggesting 
that the hydrogen in 
Earth’s water originated 
from clouds of dust and gas 
remaining after the forma-
tion of the Sun.
Historically, it has been 
widely accepted that most, 
if not all, of Earth’s water 
came from asteroids, 
largely due to a similar deu-
terium-to-hydrogen ratio 
between oceanic water and 
that found on asteroids 
in our solar systems (the 
deuterium-to-hydrogen 
ratio is a unique chemical 
signature of water sourc-
es, since deuterium is a 
heavier isotope of ordinary 
hydrogen).
Researchers for the 
study, conducted at Arizona 
State University, chose to 
study hydrogen since it is 
much more common in our 
solar system than oxygen, 
the other chemical compo-
nent of water. According to 
the authors, the hydrogen 
in oceans does not repre-
sent all hydrogen on Earth, 
since hydrogen found near 
the boundary between 
the core and mantle of the 
planet have signi?cantly 
less deuterium than ocean 
water.
In a statement, Steven 
Desch, a professor of 
astrophysics in the School 
of Earth and Space 
Exploration at Arizona 
State University, said of 
the use of the deuterium-
to-hydrogen ratio, “it’s a 
bit of a blind spot in the 
community. When people 
measure the [deuterium-
to-hydrogen] ratio in ocean 
water and they see that it is 
pretty close to what we see 
in asteroids, it was always 
easy to believe it all came 
from asteroids.”
To disprove this as-
sumption, Desch and co-
author Peter Buseck, a 
Regents’ Professor in the 
School of Earth and Space 
Exploration and School of 
Molecular Sciences, devel-
oped a novel theoretical 
model of Earth’s foundation 
several billion years ago 
where large waterlogged 
asteroids developed into 
planets while clouds of dust 
and gas still spun around 
the Sun. These planetary 
embryos rapidly collided 
and grew, the largest of 
which eventually became 
Earth. Gases from the cloud 
around the Sun became 
Earth’s atmosphere, and 
hydrogen from the Sun’s 
gas cloud dissolved into 
the molten iron of the still-
forming Earth’s magma 
ocean (this hydrogen was 
lighter and had less deute-
rium than the hydrogen in 
other asteroids at the time). 
As more asteroids impacted 
Earth, their hydrogen was 
pulled towards the core of 
the planet due to the at-
traction between molten 
iron and hydrogen with 
higher amounts of deute-
rium. Once Earth cooled, 
much of the hydrogen from 
asteroids was left in the 
mantle while atmospheric 
hydrogen originating from 
the gas cloud around the 
Sun settled into Earth’s 
oceans.
The research team used 
their model to estimate the 
quantities of hydrogen orig-
inating from each source, 
concluding that most was 
indeed from asteroids but 
a signi?cant portion came 
from the gas cloud around 
the sun. Lead author Jun 
Wu, assistant research 
professor in the School of 
Molecular Sciences and 
School of Earth and Space 
Exploration at Arizona 
State University, said in a 
statement, “For every 100 
molecules of Earth’s water, 
there are one or two coming 
from solar nebula.”
A major application of 
this study could be new 
models about the develop-
ment of other planets and 
their ability to support life. 
Other planets could have 
developed in a similar fash-
ion to the theoretical model 
put forth by the authors. 
“This model suggests that 
the inevitable formation of 
water would likely occur on 
any suf?ciently large rocky 
exoplanets in extrasolar 
systems,” Wu said. “I think 
this is very exciting.”
Earth’s water could be from the Sun

Earth’s water, there are one or two 
coming from solar nebula.”

The Carnegie Mellon 
University football team played 
its ?nal game of the 2018 season 
on Saturday, Nov. 17, squaring 
off against Geneva College in the 
Go4theGoal Game for Pediatric 
Cancer. Saturday also marked 
Senior Day, the ?nal game seniors 
would play in the Cardinal and 
Gray uniform. The Tartans scored 
28 unanswered points to defeat 
the Geneva Golden Tornadoes, 
?nishing the season with a 
6–4 overall record and a 5–4 
record in the Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC).
The Tartans started the game 
with the ball, but their drive 
stalled on the Geneva 31-yard 
line. A holding penalty set the 
offense back at 4th and 13, and 
senior quarterback Alex Cline 
threw an interception to give the 
Golden Tornadoes the ball. But 
the Tartan defense responded. 
Senior defensive end Long Tran 
forced a fumble on The Tartans’ 
very ?rst offensive play, and 
senior outside linebacker Quinn 
Zsido recovered the ball to give 
possession right back to the 
Tartan offense.
On the following drive, Cline 
and the offense marched down 
the ?eld to the Geneva 17-yard 
line, converting a fourth down 
past mid?eld and spreading the 
offense around. Cline took a sack 
for an 11-yard loss to the 38-yard 
line, but scored on the ensuing 
play with a 28-yard strike to 
sophomore wide receiver Alec 
Oshita in the back right corner of 
the end zone to get on the board 
?rst, 7–0.
On Geneva’s ?rst play of their 
next drive, they ran 71 yards all 
the way to the Carnegie Mellon 
two-yard line. Two plays later, 
Geneva ran up the middle into the 
end zone to tie the game, 7–7.
In the second quarter, Geneva 
took the lead 14–7 after another 
long run on the ?rst play of the 
drive, this time for 59 yards. The 
Tartans responded with a 75-yard 
drive that ?nished with a 20-yard 
touchdown from Cline to Oshita, 
to tie the game at 14–14.
Geneva’s turnovers continued 
on the next drive. Junior safety 
Thomas Polutchko intercepted 
the ball on Geneva’s ?rst passing 
attempt of the game, with 6:52 
left to play in the ?rst half. The 
Tartan offense took over on 
the Geneva 40-yard line, and 
reclaimed the lead, 21–14, with 
5-yard Cline touchdown to senior 
halfback Karl Kumm.
In the second half, the Tartans 
continued to score. Cline’s fourth 
and ?nal touchdown of the game 
came early in the third quarter. 
From the Geneva 16-yard line, 
Cline kept the ball and rushed 
14 yards to the two-yard line. He 
then completed a quick throw 
to ?rst-yard wide receiver Kris 
Hughes in the end zone, extend-
ing the lead to 28–14.
With 4:34 left in the third 
quarter, sophomore running back 
Luke Bikulege scored the Tartans’ 
only rushing touchdown of the 
game with 26-yards out. The 
35–14 score would stand after a 
scoreless fourth quarter.
Though the Tartan defense 
played well in the ?rst half, 
forcing turnovers and limiting 
Geneva to two scores, they made 
adjustments in the second half 
to stop the Golden Tornadoes’ 
powerful run game and shutting 
them out in the second half.
Zsido and Polutchko both 
recorded 11 tackles each to lead 
the team. Senior cornerback 
Ethan Anderson also made an 
impact with eight tackles, six of 
them solo, a tackle for a six-yard 
loss, a forced fumble, and an 
interception.
In his ?nal game as a Tartan, 
Cline threw for four touchdowns 
to become Carnegie Mellon’s 
all-time leader in touchdown 
passes at 56. He ?nished the 
day 33-for-47 for 332 yards. He 
also extended his records the 
school’s all-time leader in passing 
yards and all-time leader in 
completions.
Kumm had a career day, with 
11 catches for 115 yards and a 
touchdown. Oshita was one of 
Cline’s favorite targets, recording 
?ve catches for 73 yards and two 
touchdowns.

As someone who takes a lot 
of stats classes, I crunched the 
numbers, and I have lost a total 
of a ?fth of all of the games 
of the Tartan Fantasy League. 
Ordinarily, I would try and 
mitigate this humiliating statistic 
by pointing out that Sports Editor 
Marika Yang has lost somewhere 
on the order of half of all of the 
games, but unfortunately I cannot 
even do that this week because I 
was bested by Yang herself.
She showed me last week 
how to drop players and I got rid 
of my inactive players, so don’t 
anticipate me writing this column 
ever again. If nothing else, trying 
my hand at pretend-football has 
led me to be concerned for the 
health and wellbeing of real-life 
football players because at one 
point literally half of my team 
was taking a sick day. I suppose 
that’s rich, coming from someone 
who, as she is writing this, is 
extremely sore from an exercise 
class that was called, I kid you 
not, “Mild Cardio.”
Anywho, on to what actually 
happened this week. This week 
saw a major upset in the rankings. 
I dropped a STUNNING four 
places in the rankings, ?nishing in 
eighth place. Visual Editor Tracy 
Le is now ?rst place, unseating 
publisher Caleb Miller, now in 
second place. Yang and Pillbox 
editor Michelle Madlansacay 
both rose three spots in the 
rankings, reaching fourth and 
?fth place, respectively. Photo 
Editor Lisa Qian also dropped 
one rung, ending up in seventh 
place. If I lose again next week, I 
promise to learn what a running 
back is so I can make these arti-
cles spicier and more informative 
for you guys.
GOAT but Ironically over 
Slugs, 97.10 to 97.36
Assistant Pillbox editor Izzy 
Sio’s GOAT but Ironically beat 
out Operations Manager Adam 
Tunnard’s Slugs. This does not 
surprise me, as I have heard 
directly from the horse’s mouth 
that Tunnard does not even 
know who is on his autodrafted 
team, where Sio is a veri?able 
imaginary football enthusiast. 
Sio’s team had two high scores, 
earning 22.00 points from Los 
Angeles Rams running back Todd 
Gurley and 20.06 points from 
Patrick Mahomes, quarterback 
for the Kansas City Chiefs.
Sio’s third-ranked team has 
proved to be impressive, as 
Mahomes earns the title of best 
quarterback in the league for 
the third week straight. Sio lost 
to Tunnard in Week 3, but more 
than paid him back in kind with 
this decisive victory. Sio will go 
on to play Yang’s Gin and Bear

against me. He is not prepared, 
and he will be crushed, mentally 
and emotionally.
futbol over Last Manning 
Standing, 151.42 to 131.50
This game led to Le’s futbol 
unseating Miller’s Last Manning 
Standing from its long-held spot 
at the top of the league, which 
means that Miller’s team name 
now should read Second to Last 
Manning Standing. Le and Miller 
were the top scorers this week, so 
their faceoff was an exciting one. 
The fantasy football website’s 
game-summarizing algorithm 
tells me that this week, Miller 
scored the most points anyone 
has ever scored without winning 
thus far.
Both teams over-performed 
their projections, due in a large 
part to their high scorers. Le got 
32.90 points from Nick Chubb, 
running back for the Cleveland 
Browns and 30.30 from David 
Johnson, running back for 
the Arizona Cardinals. I am 
impressed and I don’t even know 
what a running back does! futbol

Last weekend, Carnegie 
Mellon University’s volleyball 
team played against Ithaca 
College in the Regional Final 
of the 2018 NCAA Division 
III Women’s Volleyball 
Championship. Though the 
Tartans lost by the scores 25–21, 
25–22, and 25–23, the team 
made history by becoming the 
first Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team to make it to the Sweet 
16 in the NCAA Volleyball 
Championship tournament.
Several team members were 
recognized as All-America 
Honorable Mention nominees 
for their effort and their 
amazing season by the American 
Volleyball Coaches Association. 
Two others gained even higher 
distinctions. Junior Maia 
So-Holloway was named Second 
Team All-America and junior 
Sarah Jurgens secured a spot on 
the third team. This week, The 
Tartan sat with team co-captain 
So-Holloway, who was also 
named a first-team all-University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
honoree.
So-Holloway is a junior 
business administration major 
with a global systems and 
management minor from 
Oakland, CA, who plays setter for 
the Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team. Because she was recruited 
to play volleyball for the 
university, she cites the sport as 
her main reason for choosing to 
attend Carnegie Mellon, but she 
also chose to come to Pittsburgh 
because she knew she would 
be able to balance playing the 
sport she loves with high-quality 
academics.
So-Holloway acknowledges 
that being a part of the team takes 
up a significant amount of her 
time, but says her favorite part 
of being a part of the volleyball 
team is getting a break from 
school every day to play the sport 
she loves with her teammates, 
who have since become close 
friends. Though she doesn’t have 
a lot of down time, her favorite 
pastimes are spending time with 
friends, getting dinner, and, of 
course, playing volleyball. Off 
the court, she is also a part of the 
Kappa Alpha Theta sorority on 
campus.
As for volleyball, she says her 
proudest moment and favorite 
memory since joining the team is 
this year’s NCAA Championship 
tournament, where the team 
made it to the round of 16 for the 
first time in university history. 
Nonetheless, she recognizes that 
being a part of the team can be 
challenging. This season, the 
team began slowly, losing four of 
its first seven matches. This string 
of bad results forced the team to 
reflect on its performances and 
commit to working harder. The 
team’s commitment led to more 
competitive play on the court, 
improving their record for this 
past season as well as earlier 
seasons’ results. Upon reflection, 
So-Holloway says that overall, 
this season served as a lesson for 
her and the team to not let recent 
bad results get in the way of the 
work and preparation for what 
lies ahead.
Now that the 2018 season 
is over, So-Holloway is looking 
forward to next season, her 
senior season. She eagerly 
anticipates being able to meet 
the new first-year team members 
and playing with her teammates, 
both returning and new. Now 
a co-captain of the team, she is 
also embracing the opportunity 
to act as a role model for her 
fellow team members.

Alexandra Yu | Pillbox EditorAdvice for Awkward People
Dear Alexandra,
I am going home for Thanksgiving and really want 
to be able to enjoy my time with friends and family 
back home, but I am really stressed about the last 
two weeks of classes before finals. I have several 
major assignments and tests when we return from 
break, and I don’t know how to balance work with 
taking a break. Please help!
Too Hard-pressed, Always Need to Kill Stress
Dear THANKS,
You deserve a break after 3 months of non-stop 
grind, but classes unfortunately don’t slow down 
as much as we’d like them to, even when our 
professors wish us a happy holiday. It’s definitely 
hard to decide how to allocate your time, and 
I know this is the easier-said-than-done answer, 
but try to divide your days home into different 
segments.
Maybe Wednesday you want to allocate towards 
spending more time with friends and family, since 
you haven’t been home in a while. But, if you know 
there will be a lull in the activities, block out a 
chunk of that time to strictly do work with minimal 
distractions. Or, if you know you’ll spend all 
morning on Friday going Black Friday shopping, 
spend the rest of the day working on that essay 
due next week.
Even if you’re traveling to a relative’s on Thursday 
for Thanksgiving dinner, if it’s a long trip, you 
can bring some flash cards or your textbook and 
familiarize yourself with some key terms for your 
upcoming tests (unless you get car sick, maybe 
don’t do that).
If you’re worried about not following through in 
the moment, make a plan beforehand. Whether 
it’s alternating between work and social life every 
other day or allocating certain hours of the day 
to each type of task, make that plan and stick to 
it. Of course, it’s not set in stone, but if you shift 
things around in one domain, try to have some self-
control and retain the same proportion, whatever 
you deem it to be.
Hope this helps!

Sujay Utkarsh | Assistant Pillbox EditorBrunch Buddies: Smoke Barbeque Taqueria
Technically a supper with my mother.
My mother came to Pittsburgh recently, which 
meant that I had an excuse to go to several 
new and exciting restaurants and break her 
bank account. One of these new and exciting 
restaurants I went to was Smoke Barbeque 
Taqueria in Lawrenceville, a Mexican restaurant 
that primarily specializes in large tacos and queso.
The location: The restaurant is located near Row 
House Cinema, but the entrance isn’t particularly 
flashy or easy to see. This fact combined with my 
mother’s awful sense of direction led to us getting 
lost for a minute. However, the location is fairly 
intuitive, and its proximity to Row House is a huge 
plus. The restaurant is also cash only, which was 
somewhat inconvenient for us. However, they have 
an ATM located in the back of the restaurant, so 
they clearly anticipate people not having cash.
The food: My mother and I ordered the house 
queso dip with chips. The queso had chicken, 
avocado, black beans, onions, and hot sauce 
in it. We each also ordered tacos, which were 
quite possibly the largest tacos I’ve ever eaten. 
I don’t exactly remember what we ordered, but 
one taco had chorizo in it and the other was the 
house special of the day. This was clearly a more 
Americanized take on Mexican food, which would 
normally be a criticism. However, in this case, the 
food was incredibly rich, flavorful, and actually 
much better than I anticipated it being.
The chips and queso came first, and the 
presentation of the food was an absolute surprise. 
The chips were most likely house made and were 
not like traditional nacho chips, and the queso 
was one of the heaviest things I’ve had in a long 
time. Despite all the food being very rich, it wasn’t 
overbearing to the point where I couldn’t eat 
anymore. Overall, the food was a delight and not 
at all what I was expecting.
The vibe: Lawrenceville has a number of 
restaurants that look a lot more upscale and 
bourgeois, and Smoke Barbeque Taqueria falls 
into the same category. The interior decor was this 
nice small space that somehow managed to feel 
open. Everything was made of wood was a really 
nice touch. Everyone was having a great time, and 
the music really complemented the good vibes.
Lit or Nah: This place is definitely lit. I’ll definitely 
be returning to this restaurant several more times 
to try every queso and every taco they possibly 
have.

STAN LEE
I’m pretty sure I knew who Stan Lee was before I knew about Marvel. Maybe 
that’s why the death of the founder of Marvel Comics still doesn’t feel real to 
me.
Stan Lee passed away at the age of 95 on Nov. 12. Lee always seemed 
like someone who would outlive even me. He always seemed so energetic, 
full of life, and eager to create. Amidst the scandals and tragedies of his life, 
Stan Lee seemed like a man who would always pull through, never give up, 
and remain standing.
remembering
If his body can’t, his spirit will certainly outlive us all. Throughout Marvel, 
Lee was everywhere, all-encompassing. He laid the foundations for all the 
heroes you see in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, all of Fox’s X-Men mov-
ies, and Sony’s Spider-Man movies. It’s even hard to pin down what he 
truly is responsible for, because the answer is simply everything. Marvel 
Entertainment has a few constants, and he was undoubtedly one of them.
I’m still trying to remember what exactly led me to the entertainment giant 
in the first place, but I think it was Wolverine & The X-Men, an old and 
forgotten cartoon series on Nickelodeon about, well, Wolverine and the 
X-Men. It wasn’t as popular and iconic as the older 90s animated series 
(heck even I almost forgot about this series when I was writing this article), 
but I loved the different kinds of mutants, the moral compass of Charles 
Xavier, Logan’s aloofness. Even years later, at one mention of the TV 
series, I can remember Kitty Pryde’s youthful energy, Iceman’s humor and 
sass, and the awe-inspiring power of Jean Grey – the most powerful mutant 
of her time. The world of the X-Men seemed so expansive with endless pos-
sibilities, and I just wanted to learn more about it.
That eagerness to learn more about the X-Men led me to X-Men: First 
Class, a movie about a younger Charles Xavier and Magneto that ultimate-
ly led me to a deeper plunge into Marvel and the entertainment industry. I 
was blown away by the acting talent, and I was excited by this deep world 
I had seen on TV being explored (and done justice) right before me.
While I was seeking to learn more about the X-Men, I was drawn to how 
the story of the X-Men served as such a huge mirror on the social issues of 
its creation: racism and civil rights, anti-Semitism, diversity, LGBTQ+ themes, 
genocide, and many more. It’s amazing how one superhero team was so 
diverse at the time of its creation, and how not just the X-Men comics, but 
the entirety of Marvel, still tries to explore these themes today.
I’m incredibly thankful that throughout Marvel’s history, Stan Lee has 
inspired others to thread this diversity and rich storytelling throughout the 
company. Whenever I stand back to look at Marvel’s legacy, I’m in awe of 
how inclusive and revolutionary it has become, as well as Stan Lee’s com-
mitment to pushing new ground, something he’s set a precedent for. And 
whenever I get into a heated debate with my friends about Marvel, I know 
where that shared passion we have stems from.
Stan Lee once said that as a child, he always wanted to write the “Great 
American Novel,” and I think through Marvel he’s achieved something 
greater than that. Marvel has become a company that doesn’t just repre-
sent the United States at one point in time. It’s become a company that 
we’ve grown up with and that we’ve seen rise to astounding heights. It 
reaches out and carries an understanding of all types of U.S. citizens, and 
has taught us to educate, accept, fight, and never give up. Throughout 
Marvel’s countless movies, video games, TV series, and comic book series, 
Stan Lee truly taught us what true heroes are and what they represent.
I never expected that Marvel would be such a huge part of my life now. 
It’s helped me to find my closest friends, and has helped me fuel my pas-
sions and find the career path I want to pursue in the future. But behind the 
franchise, seeing Stan Lee never falter and be such a strong, representative 
force for his creations is even more inspiring. I only hope that wherever I 
go in life and wherever I work, that I can display half of the passion, love, 
and care that Stan Lee showed for Marvel – the company and life force 
that’s changed the lives of so many people.
Excelsior Stan Lee, and thank you for everything.

written by Madeline Kim | Forum Editorart by Anna Boyle | Art EditorK-Beauty
a Korean’s take on the increasing popularity of Korean makeup brands
Being the beauty product fiend that I am, I wanted to check out the lat-
est products trending on Sephora’s website in light of their store-wide fall 
sale. When I clicked on the “Beauty’s Rising Stars” tab, I was shocked 
to see that so many of the brands were Korean. For this week, Kaja’s 
Cheeky Blush Stamps made it to Sephora’s Beauty’s Rising Stars. This is 
not the first time Sephora featured a Korean brand as a Rising Star; skin-
care brand Saturday Skin was featured in Volume 14 in Jan. 2018.
Before Sephora gave these specific products shoutouts, I was well 
aware that K-Beauty was increasing in popularity in recent years. I saw 
Western beauty gurus on YouTube testing out these exotic prod-
ucts packaged in cutesy containers. Cushion foundations, 
sheet masks, and BB creams were entering drugstores’ 
shelves — all products originating from Korea — and 
covered the shelves of practically every beauty 
section in every drugstore I visited. Seeing 
brands that are more popular in the U.S., 
from affordable brands like Wet n’ Wild to 
luxury brands like Lancome, try to adopt 
trends set by Korean brands filled me with 
a sense of great joy.
Obviously, I’m not the mastermind who 
invented any of those products. However, 
being able to share them with my loved 
ones lets me feel like I can share a part 
of my world with others. Imagine having 
a friend who lives far away from you visit 
you. You take them to your favorite restau-
rant and share the experience of enjoying 
your favorite dishes. Now, take this experience 
and amplify it. That’s essentially what it feels like 
to be able to go shopping with my friends and be 
able to recommend products that I grew up watching 
my mother and other empowering women in my life use.
My mother recently saw her sister for the first time in over two years. 
One of the things they got to bond over was an emerging Korean skin-
care brand, Belif. “How’d you know about this brand; it’s a Korean 
brand!,” my aunt said. I had actually recommended my mother this skin-
care brand after receiving some free samples.
Unfortunately, I have yet to test out my mother’s favorites from back 
when she was in college, as many of the brands still test on animals due 
to China’s requirement for products to be tested on animals before hit-
ting brick and mortar shelves. However, if the animal testing policy were 
to be lifted, something reminiscent of my mother’s college days could 
linger even decades after she graduated on the opposite side of the 
globe. Luckily, an end to China’s animal testing policy may be on the 
horizon. Once that domino is toppled, brands will no longer have incen-
tives to continue animal testing, as other methods, such as in-vitro testing 
are more ethical, accurate, and cost-efficient.
Of course, there is room for improvement in Korean beauty. Because 
of their origins, the shade range for Korean complexion products is 
extremely lacking for Western standards. Some brands with a larger 
international reach such as Laneige has expanded their shade selection 
beyond the traditional four or five most other brands offer, but potential 
consumers with darker or lighter complexions often don’t have many 
options, if any at all. It makes sense that Korean products mainly 
cater to light beige skin colors, as Korea’s demograph-
ics are much more homogeneous than America’s. 
However, as K-beauty increases its global spread, 
I think it’s safe to say that brands will expand 
and allow not just those with light beige skin to 
enjoy their products, but also people with all 
other skin colors.
There is room for optimism. Julep, a 
brand owned by Korean entrepreneur 
Jane Park, offers thirty shades for con-
cealers. Park remembered what it was 
like to immigrate from South Korea to 
Canada at the age of four, and she 
remembered what it was like to feel like 
she had no voice. Now, through her nail 
care, skin care, and cosmetics line, she is 
aspiring to inspire women everywhere to 
build confidence and take risks. Julep is one 
of the fastest-growing beauty brands and sets 
the example of how to make Korean beauty 
more inclusive to a diverse population. Similarly, 
Kaja’s models display the versatility of their product 
range by showing how their products work on the fairest 
and darkest skin tones.
It’s fantastic that I can finally get my K-beauty fix without paying 
ridiculous international fees or asking my friends and family in Korea to 
send over some goods. However, nothing can truly replace the unique 
experience of going into a store with some friends or my mother, and 
testing out different products on the back of my hand (and consequently 
turning my hand into a shimmery painter’s palette). It sounds silly that 
I find so much value in beauty products; at the end of the day, it’s just 
powders and creams. However, for me, I also see them as experiences I 
get to share with others. As I count down the days until I get to see my 
mother, I cannot wait to chat over sheet masks with her.

If you were around the Cohon Center 
Studio Theater on Friday night or the Alumni 
Concert Hall on Saturday evening, you may 
have heard the graceful lilts of a harp and 
sharp powerhouse vocals drifting down the 
hall — that was Compos-it’s New Works 
Opera Festival. Featuring seven operas writ-
ten, composed, and performed by students, 
Compos-it’s second festival was even more 
successful and vivid than the first.
According to their website, Compos-it is “a 
proto-opera company focused on rapid-
prototyping new works of musical drama and 
facilitating student collaborations.” Founded 
originally by Artistic Director Russell Henry 
Holbert and Executive Director Josh Brown 
in 2017, the second Compos-it festival began 
with a lineup over triple in size — from two 
operas to seven. It was a weekend full of 
excitement, heartfelt emotion, and student 
ingenuity, featuring stories of a girl falling in 
love with a star to a petrified Russian govern-
ment worker faced with a drastic decision.
“This entire festival has been an amazing 
opportunity to get to know people and their 
working styles, and see people who might not 
have generally considered themselves writers 
or composers by study or degree to just kind 
of ‘do a thing.’ And that’s really the ethic of 
this festival, the ‘Do the thing!’” said founder 
Josh Brown.

This article contains spoilers for Can You Ever Forgive Me?
In a poignant narrative for our current time, where we question the veracity of established institutions, the Marianne Heller-directed biopic 
about 90’s writer Lee Israel (Melissa McCarthy) titled Can You Ever Forgive Me? tells the story of a monetarily-challenged writer whose 
hustle involves embodying characters of famous people in the past. Israel forges letters that pass as originals from whichever person she 
decides to embody, and then she sells them to collectors for hundreds of dollars at a time.
Both people she encounters in early exploits, Jack Hock (Richard Grant) and bookish collector Anna (Dolly Wells), end up following the 
descent of McCarthy’s character into increasingly more involved crimes. Anna falls off the ride after an awkward dinner encounter, sugges-
tive of Israel’s infatuation with Anna, but Hock, the other apple of Israel’s eye, sticks with it until the very end. Previously the introverted 
cat-lady, Israel finds herself in increasingly intimate relationships with the people she is drawing into harm. After cutting off Anna, Israel 
places the dependency of her happiness onto Hock, and she forms a bond with a close friend that’s suggested she has never had before. 
However, when Israel’s prize cat dies while she is away on the climactic heist of the film, she blames Hock, throwing him out of her life. 
Ultimately, Israel is an abrasive and emotionally abusive character towards Hock, but the film does not color it that way. Israel is in conver-
sation with every brooding, male, Byronic hero that has captured the narrative imagination for years. McCarthy herself has said that Israel 
is the character every woman wants to play. Every nuance of character drawn out by the film seems like a rational character digression, 
until the point where it is too much. But unlike the male protagonist of days past, Israel does not quite get everything she wants.
All of the film is not just one performance though, and every piece comes together to create a nostalgic sense of New York City, of flam-
boyant characters, and of feeling real import. There are shots that linger in just the right places to leave you bathing in the colors, the 
beauty, and the experience of it all. It’s a narrative film that touches all the right notes of character development and plot progression, but 
also one interspersed with moments of poetry, like the sickly yellow and black gay bar on the Upper West Side, that left me wanting more.
In the end, this slow burn drama is filled with expansive characters and moments of non-narrative cinema that help transform a potentially 
standard biopic into a film that draws the imagination away from the face value question of trust in the post-truth era. The questions left to 
us by the film are the defining questions of our humanity. What does it mean to love another person? Are we able to forgive those people 
for their misdeeds? Should we?

Light
Up
Night
 written by 
Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox Editor
It’s usually around this time of the year that my workload piles up, and I have so many things going on that it’s difficult to start getting into 
the holiday spirit. Although I do appreciate Au Bon Pain’s seasonal change in their disposable container designs, it’s really hard to find 
any other form of celebration for the holiday season on campus. That’s why I always get so excited for Pittsburgh’s annual Light Up Night.
It’s become a tradition for me and my friends to go to Light Up Night and see all the wonderful decorations and festivities put on by the 
city. From the big concerts to the fireworks, my friends and I would always do our best to hit up the night’s main events. However, this 
year we decided to do things a little differently. We started the night with dinner at Talia Cucina & Rosticceria, which we had to book 
reservations for way in advance because most of the restaurants downtown get fully booked during Light Up Night. They served some 
delicious Italian food, and the atmosphere was so comfortable and festive, with families, dates, and adult friend groups all chatting over 
candle-lit tables. It was a wonderful place to have dinner during such an exciting and holiday-spirited event.
After dinner, my friends and I went straight to Market Square, which is transformed every year into a little Christmas village. We went here 
instead of going to the annual big concert that’s hosted during Light Up Night. This year, A Great Big World was the main performer, and 
although it would have been cool to see them, my friends and I were craving some sweets and thought the market would have some. In 
previous years, I never actually took the time to go through the market because usually it’s always so crowded with people. It’s not like this 
year was any different, but it was really nice to see all the holiday-themed shops, the live performances by some local artists, and Dunkin 
Donuts’ convenient hot chocolate and munchkin outdoor sale for the hungry and freezing event-goers.
Exploring the Christmas market for the first time was definitely a fun experience for me, especially since it reminded me of the outdoor 
holiday markets that are organized around where I’m from. From the market, our original plan was to go ice skating and then watch the 
fireworks. Unfortunately, the lines were extremely long for ice skating, where I think we waited almost two hours; so we never actually 
made it to see the fireworks (but I don’t think they change drastically from year to year). At least my friends and I got our annual 
experience of skating around the giant Christmas tree in the center of the rink. Having this quality time to spend with some of my closest 
friends and to start off my holiday festivities was certainly much needed. Best of all, this event only marks the beginning of the holiday 
season, and there’s still so much more to look forward to!

---------------------------------------------------

The Tartan: So my first question I want to ask: 
where did you get the name San Holo?
San Holo: So my real name is Sander Van 
Dijck. It’s a super dutch name. San Holo just 
started out as a joke. People would call me 
San for a long time, and one time I was with 
a group of friends and they were like, “San, 
you know your name isn’t cool enough to 
be an artist name, you know. Maybe you 
should do something like San Holo,” and 
everyone started laughing because of the Star 
Wars thing. But then I kind of started using 
that, and now I’m here, you know. I never 
expected to blow up this way.
The Tartan: Yeah, I was wondering about your 
name. There had to be a Star Wars joke in there 
somewhere.
SH: The thing is I’m not a huge Star Wars fan 
at all. But it’s just because my name is San, 
or Sander.
The Tartan: Alright, we got the obligatory name 
question out of the way. I recently got around 
to listening to your album and I have very 
limited experience with EDM music. You can 
probably tell by my Metallica shirt. But your 
music sounds a lot more airy and ambient than 
what I’ve heard, and you use guitar in there 
quite often. So my question is who are your 
primary influences and what is your writing 
process?
SH: So I’m from your scene. I used to be 
in rock bands and indie bands, and then I 
studied guitar, and I’m a graduated guitarist. 
No one ever asked me for my credentials, 
or my diploma, ever, but I studied guitar 
for a long time. At some point I didn’t feel 
like I could do anything new on the guitar 
anymore. Everyone sounded the same, you 
know. All bands sounded the same, and 
I was like “I’m gonna make some beats.” 
And with the beats stuff, I was really able to 
go into my own direction. I even dropped 
the guitar for years. But at a certain point, I 
started feeling the same way about electronic 
music. You know, I can’t do anything new 
anymore. I want to be able to innovate s**t. 
And that’s when the guitar came back in 
my production, and I feel like I’m in my own 
lane again. I love bands like Explosions in 
the Sky, I don’t know if you know them. I love 
Metallica too, I mean they’re great. I really 
listen to a lot of music, you know, classical 
music, rock music, ambient music. Yeah.
The Tartan: The other thing I was interested in 
is the persona of San Holo. Where do you think 
you’d take this persona next? What do you plan 
on doing with this style of music in the future?
SH: Yeah, I really want to keep developing 
my own style. For me, the most important 
thing is to be in my own lane always. I always 
want to feel like I’m doing something of my 
own. Like, I don’t like being compared to 
other DJs. I don’t like it when someone says, 
“Yeah yeah you’re great. You sound a little bit 
like that.” I never like that. I always want to 
be known for my sound. If someone puts on 
my music, I want them to instantly know that 
it’s a San Holo song because of the guitar, 
or the samples or sounds I use. So I want to 
keep doing that as long as I can, you know. 
Staying in my lane and doing my own thing. 
And yeah, that’s it.
The Tartan: Yeah, I also write music on the side. 
I have a prog band and one of the challenges 
we have is to not sound like Dream Theater you 
know? So your answer was really relatable.
SH: My girlfriend has a kind of a prog band, sanholo

like a math band. Have you ever heard of 
Covet?
The Tartan: Oh yeah, I’ve heard of Covet. I’ve 
been meaning to get into their stuff lately.
SH: Yeah they’ve been touring with Polyphia. 
You probably know Polyphia as well.
The Tartan: Yeah, I know Polyphia.
SH: Yeah I have fairly limited experience in 
the prog scene because I don’t really listen to 
that specifically. But yeah, like you said. At first 
you think, “Oh it’s cool, we’re great because 
we sound a little bit like that band.” But then 
you realize that it’s not good to sound like 
someone else. Everyone starts out with an 
instrument copying other people. I started 
out trying to be Jimi Hendrix, you know. John 
Mayer, Stevie Ray Vaughn, all those guitar 
players that I love. Then at some point you 
realize that this has all been done before. I’m 
just looking for that new sound always.
The Tartan: I know one of the questions artists 
get asked a lot is, what to made you want to 
start writing music? What was that flashpoint? 
I’m assuming for you that it’s that drive to find 
your own sound and your own unique voice, 
right?
SH: Yeah. My own unique thing, I think. I 
started guitar because I felt like it was a cool 
thing to do, and you know, sometimes there’s 
not really a reason for it. It’s just a feeling. It 
never was a choice for me, like I wanted to 
be a musician. Ever since I started playing 
guitar, I knew that music was going to be a 
big thing in my life.
The Tartan: So this next question is something 
I really want to ask to up and coming artists in 
the industry, and it’s a two part question. So the 
first part of the question is, what’s something 
you’ve learned about the industry that hasn’t 
necessarily made you jaded, but has changed 
your viewpoint on the glamor of the industry?
SH: Yeah the music industry is not about 
music. It’s about industry. I’m in it for the 
music. The music industry is more about the 
brand and everything around it. You know, 
I’ve noticed a lot of beautiful things. I think 
it’s beautiful how people can relate to my 
music sometimes, and like, feel something. 
It’s mind-blowing. I have fans that help me 
through hard times in my life. There’s music 
that speaks to you and motivates you to do 
stuff, and to have people look at me the 
same way I look at my heroes, you know 
that’s really a crazy feeling. I’m literally 
making music that speaks to so many people 
in the crowd tonight, and it’s surreal and 
it’s overwhelming. Also, maybe kind of a 
sad thing I realized, a thing that made me 
a little depressed when I found out was that 
music is not, per se, all about music. I think 
people who are fans of a band are mostly 
because of the music but there’s also a lot of 
people that are fans of them because of the 
aesthetic, or the way they present themselves 
you know. Like if it’s a beautiful guy or a 
beautiful girl on stage, or they have a really 
cool brand or a really cool helmet on.
There’s a lot of people that can’t distinguish 
sounds from each other. Like, you’re a 
musician. You would probably be able to say, 
“Oh I know the difference between Dream 
Theater and Polyphia.” But a lot of people 
can’t. They just hear the sound coming out, 
and it’s good for me to realize that. I think I 
have a fairly distinct sound, and if you put me 
beside other EDM producers, I could definitely 
tell that this is different. A lot of people can’t. 
I don’t know how to explain this, but if people 
can’t distinguish artists by listening to them, 
then it becomes a visual thing. It’s definitely 
not only the music, and I’m also guilty of it. 
Like when I listened to Limp Bizkit when I 
was a kid. I still think they’re an awesome 
band. It’s not a very fair comparison, but 
there is a reason that Limp Bizkit was bigger 
and more hype back then than Rage Against 
the Machine was. Because I feel like, you 
know, Limp Bizkit was just the guy with the 
hat on, and there was Fred Durst, you know, 
the guitar player with the f******g makeup 
on and that really works as well. The music 
has to be good you know, but there is more 
to music than just music. But for me as a 
creator, it’s just music. That was a really long 
and complicated answer.
The Tartan: No, it’s a really tough question to 
answer. Because part two of the question is 
what’s something you wish you knew about the 
industry before you entered it? Because from 
what it sounds like, you wish you understood 
the fact that the industry isn’t always about the 
music.
SH: Yeah, yeah. That’s a very good question. 
Almost too good. Let me just answer it like 
this. There are so many things I’ve learned 
throughout the years by touring and listening 
to music, and you know, just being in the 
music industry that I can’t even remember 
what I didn’t know when I started because 
I’ve learned so much. It’s been a crazy 
trip. But when we think of, you know, Jimi 
Hendrix, the first thing you think about when 
you hear the name Jimi Hendrix, you think 
about how he looks and what guitar he 
plays. But we should actually be thinking 
about the music right? If you think about a 
band, you kind of visualize the band right. 
Like how they look or the logo or something, 
but not the songs. I personally don’t, maybe 
you do. Sorry, I’m going in the completely 
wrong direction.
The Tartan: No, I understand what you’re going 
for.
SH: Let me answer that question by I learned 
a lot. I learned a lot throughout the years 
about my life, about love, human beings in 
general. It’s just too much to talk about.
The Tartan: Alright, this was great. Thank you so 
much for your time.
SH: No problem, man. Don’t write too badly 
about me.

Opening the show was special guest Idina Menzel, known for her roles 
in Wicked, Rent, and most recently, Frozen. Performing a variety of 
Broadway hits and songs from her album, Menzel’s trademark power-
house vocals and vibrant presence lit the audience up and energized 
the stadium. She was sassy and unapologetically her, and watching her 
onstage really showcased her abilities as a performer. Most notably, 
though, was a performance she dedicated to “choosing love over big-
otry and hate.” Wearing a bejeweled “Stronger than Hate” Pittsburgh 
shirt, Menzel brought the stadium together to celebrate strength and love 
through difficult, painful times.
Josh Groban was equally vibrant, his soothing lullaby-like voice echoing 
across the ice-rink floor of PPG Paints. He said about his time at Carnegie 
Mellon University: “We are so thrilled to be back here, this is a city that 
holds a lot of incredible memories for me, I would be remiss if I did not 
mention that this is a city that I went to college in, for a very short amount 
of time. I went to Carnegie Mellon, which is an incredible university, we’re 
still very deeply connected. They are really one of the top schools in the 
country, period, but they are also such an amazing school for theater. I 
was a musical theater major, which meant we worked like, ALL DAY. We 
did the acting classes, the singing classes, the ballet classes – I had to do 
ballet at Carnegie Mellon University. Pittsburgh, this is just how intensive 
the Carnegie Mellon program is. They saw my audition, they knew I was 
a double threat and not a triple threat! And yet! ‘These are spandex, you 
will wear them Groban!’ It was good, it built character. Carnegie Mellon 
humbled me. [It was a] very very hard program, but an amazing pro-
gram.”
“And I hit a fork in the road, and I got an opportunity,” he continued. “I 
was there for performance art, so I got this opportunity to do an incred-
ible record deal and work on an album, and it was a huge risk to leave 
Carnegie Mellon, because that place is a dream facility. Any student that 
goes to that school is blessed and lucky to go through that program. 
And by the way, I was in a class with incredible people like Josh Gad, 
Leslie Odom Jr., Katy Mixon, Rory O’Malley – anybody who’s been in 
Hamilton was in my class. So we were a talented class, but it was a fork 
in the road, and it was an insane decision to make, but to come back 
after all these years and to feel the love and support after all these years 
has given so much to me. It means so much to come back again and 
again. It’s very full circle and very cool and fun to be here.”
Last Friday, on Nov. 16, CMU alum and Broadway star Josh Groban performed at PPG Paints Arena as part of his Bridges album tour.

He ended the night with a heartfelt two-song encore dedicated to 
the victims and families affected by the Tree of Life shooting: “I am 
grieving along with you, I know, that this has been such a devastat-
ing time of healing and grieving for a city that is known for its com-
passion and its love and its togetherness. It’s with a heavy heart that 
we come here, to celebrate life with all of you, to come together 
in times of grief to celebrate life. I want to dedicate these next two 
encores to the victims at the Tree of Life shooting and their families. 
They are forever in our hearts, and we think of them every day.” 
There were tears in the audience’s eyes as Groban sang with genu-
ine heartfelt emotion, leaving a sense of community and solidarity in 
the air.
To see and hear more, check out Groban’s album Bridges and 
Menzel’s most recent work idina:live. Both Groban and Menzel do 
philanthropic work to help ensure that children across America have 
access to arts education. Having both been encouraged by their arts 
teachers to do what they do today, the musicians have established 
the Find Your Light and A Broader Way foundations.

first snow
Thursday, Nov. 15 was the first snow of the 
semester at Carnegie Mellon University! It 
might not have been a foot deep but that 
didn’t stop students from starting snowball 
fights – or rather slush-ball fights – building 
snowmen, and creating snow angels on the 
football field.
