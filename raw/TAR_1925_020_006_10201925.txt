CARNEGIE TIES 
W C J IN SCORE­
LESS CONTEST
Stands Collapse in the Third 
Quarter Causing Game 
to be Called Off
W-J ADVANCES NEAR 
TO PLAID GOAL LINE
Game to be Regarded as If 
Four Quarters Had 
Been Played
Tho W. & J.-Carnegie game, wliile it 
lasted was one of tlie most evenly 
matched and hard fought contests 
ever played between the two schools. 
The crippled Carnegie eleven entered 
the game with the odds greatly against 
them. Not only was Max Bastian, reg­
ular quarterback, missing from the 
lineup, but his absence had necessitat­
ed a complete change in the backfield. 
Captain Beede, and Donohoe played at 
halfs and McClelland was placed at 
fullback. The game was brought to 
an abrupt close early in the third 
quarter by the collapsing of a section 
of the reserved seat stands. Many 
persons were injured; few were seri­
ously hurt. The contest will be con­
sidered as Na 0 to 0 tie game.
The recent extensive defensive drill­
ing which the Carnegie coaches have 
made their charges undergo, showed to 
good advantage. It had been expected 
that the absence of Bastian would 
greatly weaken the Skibo offense, 
and that a defensive game entirely 
would have to be resorted to. And 
that is what happened. A great deal 
of the time the Skibos were on the 
defensive. Throughout the entire first, 
half, which proved to be the entire 
duration of the game, the ball was in 
the Plaid’s territory the greater part 
of the time.
But that is what the Tartans had 
expected and their defense could not 
be. penetrated. Time and1 again the 
Red and Black battered strongly upon 
the floor of the Plaid, but on every 
occasion they were surely if not 
speedily 'repulsed. End runs, the flash­
iest kind of end runs by Carlin, and 
Amos would gain a few yards once, 
but once was all. Double passes flew 
thick and fast, but the Plaid was not 
taken by surprise; long forward 
passes were finally resorted to as the 
closing minutes of the second quarter 
drew near, but usually a Plaid-jersey- 
ed player was nearer the receiving 
end than any one else.
In the final moments of the second 
quarter the Presidents registered their 
most dangerous threat. Throughout 
the period they had resorted to the 
air most entirely with little results. 
With but a few seconds remaining to 
be played, two successful passes, 
Amos to Carlin, brought the ball from 
the 30-yard line to within 100 yards 
of the Carnegie goal. Then a try at 
the impregnable line of the Plaid 
failed, and Amos tried another toss 
through the air. Had it been suc­
cessful a touchdown would most sure­
ly have resulted1, ibut the ball was in­
tercepted by Manby, alert Carnegie 
center. The Pittsburghers were off 
to what they hoped wouild bo a march 
down the field, but the timekeeper’s 
bugle ended further hostilities.
The chief reason why so much of 
the game was played in Plaid terri­
tory was due to the fact that frequent 
punting aws resorted to with the Presi­
dents always gaining on these ex­
changes. Amos’ boots were usually

ODD NUMBER-2ND 
PUPPET-OUT TODAY
The Odd Number of the Puppet is 
out today. This is the second issue of 
the year and takes its name from the 
fact that it will be different from any 
Puppet , so far conceived. The many 
new things which it will contain will 
be hidden behind the cover which has 
been displayed at various points on 
the campus.
It is the custom of many students 
to send the Carnegie fun magazine to 
friends in their home town or to ac­
quaintances interested in the school. 
Beginning with this issue all salesmen 
will he equipped with address blanks. 
All that has to be done in order that 
someone may receive the Puppet by 
mail is to pay the usual price of twen­
ty-five cents and give the address of 
the person they desire should receive 
the book, and the business end of the 
Puppet will attend to the rest. There 
will be no need of wrapping, address­
ing, or mailing, that will be taken 
care of. The magazine is mailed in 
an attractive envelope and is sure to 
reach its destination in good condi­
tion. This offere will hold throughout 
the year.
The Puppet which is not under Stu­
dent Council supervision, always ap­
points a faculty critic. It is the job 
of this man to censor all the material 
published. The appointment this year 
has been given to Professor Kirkpat­
rick.
There are nine issues of the Puppet 
each year. At present the staffs of 
both the business and the editorial 
end of the magazine are in need of 
men. All caring to try out should 
call at the Publication’s office, Room 
12 in the College of Industries.

The subject of bis talk for this week 
is not known.

MEN’S DORM INFIRMARY IS
ESTABLISHED IN McGILL HALL
The men’s infirmary for the dormi­
tory students has been established in 
the basement of McGill Hall. Tho 
arrangement is only temporary, but it 
will serve adequately until the prob­
lem of a separate infirmary building 
is settled.
The front part of this hall has been 
made over into a suite of four rooms 
with facilities for handling seven peo­
ple. There are three spacious sick 
rooms and a large sitting room, all 
well-lighted and attractively furnish­
ed.
Up to the present time, three cases 
have been cared for by the infirmary.
During the past year medical care 
was given students in their respective 
rooms with consequent inconvenience 
and loss of time for those engaged in 
these matters. More than three hun­
dred trays were served in this man­
ner to sick men located in all parts 
of the various buildings. The new in­
firmary is a great improvement and 
will be adequate for present needs at 
least.

To Discuss Carnegie’s Stunt 
That Will be Featured 
at the Pitt Game
ACTRESS TO TALK
OF STAGE CAREER
Pete Seaman Urges Attend­
ance of Entire Student Body 
to Develop Stunt
A very snappy pep rally, together 
with an excellent program of enter­
tainment, should bring out the stu­
dents en masse to the General Assem­
bly this morning at 11:30 at the Car­
negie Music Hall.
The pep rally will be led by Head 
Cheer Leader Pete Seaman, which will 
be assited by the other cheer leaders. 
Tech yells and songs will be prac­
ticed and other instructions for the 
features at the Pitt game will be given. 
The main point of discussion will be 
the novel stunt that Carnegie is to 
pull off between the halves. Pete 
Seaman asks that everyone come to 
assembly so that they will know their 
part in the stunt and will aid ii> 
carrying it through without a hitch. 
Coaches Bog Waddell and Al Irwin 
will give short talks on the condition 
of the team and prospects for the 
game. After the pep rally will como 
a short program of varied entertain­
ment of the highest sort.
The SQcial committee wishes this to 
be the pepiest assembly we have had 
this year, consequently they liave kept 
long-winded speakers off of the pro­
gram and have secured some big num­
bers for the students.
Chester Wallace, of the Drama De­
partment, advised the social com­
mittee to obtain, if possible, Peggy 
Wood, who is now starring at the 
Alvin Theater in Berliard Shaw’s 
play, "Candida.” And, as a result, 
Miss Wood has consented to give a 
short, snappy talk on her stage ex­
periences. Miss Wood is very tal­
ented as .those who have seen her 
act 'will testify, and her talk will as­
suredly be very interesting.
After Miss Wood’s talk come "Felix 
and Oscar,” the Kollegiate Kids. In a 
black-faced comedy skit entitled "The 
Midnight Ghost.” The Kollegiate Kids 
are two Arts students who desire that 
their names be kept secret. They 
promises a rip-roaring comedy.
La3t, but not least, on the bill of 
entertainment will be a dance, to be 
given by Ruth Aston of the Drama De­
partment. Ruth is well-known to 
the students as she has danced before 
previous assemblies, and has always 
made a big hit.
STUDENT DIRECTORY IS

1925-26 will be put on sale in the near 
future, according to tho Tri-PubMca- 
tions Staff, the copy being in the

time. The staff is to be congratulated 
on the early appearance of the publi­
cation. as there was a great deal of 
tedious work in connection with get­
ting the names and addresses of all 
the day students In school.
In addition to this, a number of im­
provements have been made on the 
booklet. Of especial notice, the book 
will be bound in attractive castilian 
in place of the ordinary manila bind­
ing.
The names of the students, with 
their addresses have been arranged

Mr. J. A. Moore, a watchman 
in the College of Fine Arts, died 
October 12, after an illness of 
sixteen months.
Mr. Moore was seventy-three 
years old. He had been at Car­
negie since 1914, but iinoe June 
a year ago, he had been unable 
to attend to his duties because 
of sickness.
Beloved by all who came In 
contact with him during his 
long period of service, his death

considerable value.

two sets in order to serve Carnogio 
students who were in the various hos­
pitals. Among those served last yoar 
wore Ben Krlstof, who broke his ankle 
In a basketball gamo, and Ev Plum­
mer, who was in the hospital twice 
with a broken shoulder.
This year three studenfs have been 
served since the first day of registra­
tion. One set has been in constant 
use for five weeks.

South Bend; A City of 
Historical Interest
400 Miles to Notre Dame on 
the Lincoln Highway
It Boems that a lot of loyal Carnegie 
rooters who can't quite see the neces­
sary cash to make the trip to South 
Bend for the Notre Dame game fail 
to realize that the trip can be made 
by automobile without much loss of 
time and at a minimum cost. As a 
matter, of fact, driving is an ideal 
way to get to the game. Not only is 
it cheaper, but there is the added 
benoiit of having your own chariot to 
take you around to see the sights be­
fore the game.
South Band is a city of historic in­
terest and is now known throughout 
the world as one of the most pro­
gressive manufacturing and industrial 
centers of the midwest. It is the 
home of Studebaker automobiles, Oli­
ver Chilled Plows, South Bend 
Watches, Westinghouse Street Light­
ing Euipment and Rectigons, South 
Bend Lathes, Singer Sewing Machines, 
South Bend Balt, Johnson Outboard 
Motors, Bendix Brakes and a score of 
other nationally known products. 
Niles, Michigan, the home of Ring 
Lardner, is but eleven miles away and 
Benton Harbor, where King Ben's 
House of David Is located, is 38 miles 
of good roads from the center of 
town.
As for the trip. Last fall I drove 
in to see the Notre Dame-Carnegie 
game at Forbes Field. Business made 
it necessary for me to spend all of 
Thanksgiving week in .Pittsburgh, so 
I left here {he Saturday1 before the 
game. Our car—three of us made the 
trip—was a badly battered four-cyl­
inder affair. At 12:50 p. 111. (Central 
time) we left the heart of South Bend 
and at 7:00 a. m. (Central time) the 
next morning we were at Central Y. 
M. C. A., Pittsburgh, with 405 miles 
showing on the speedometer. Since 
then, I’ve been over the road twice 
and 011 checking the roadmaps and 
discussing the matter with the Auto­
mobile Club, I feel reasonably sure 
that the best way to come is as out­
lined below. All but about 18 miles 
of the highway is paved and that 
short stretch is well surfaced • and 
kept in good condition.
BEAVER FALLS is the first town 
011 the road. Just which is the best 
road there is a matter of question. 
Each time I drive between that city 
and Pittsburgh I strike a different 
way. From Beaver Falls, follow the 
LINCOLN HIGHWAY to
EAST PALESTINH, OHIO; then, 
contlue 011 the Lincoln Highway 
(Ohio 5) through 
CANTON and 
MASS’ILON, to
WOOSTER. Just west of Wooster, 
loavo Ohio 5 and take HARDING 
HIGHWAY (Ohio 10), the road bear­
ing ro tho left where Ohio 5 and Ohio 
10 Intersect. Follow Ohio 10 through 
MANSFIELD,
MARION,
KENTON,
LIMA, to
DELPHOS. At Delphos. leave Ohio 
1.0 and take tho Lincoln Highway 
(Ohio 5) again through 
VAN WERT. At Ohlo-Imllana state 
lino, Lincoln Highway trail marking 
becomes Indiana 2. Follow road 
straight through to 
FORT WAYNE. INDIANA. From
YOUNGSTOWN CLAN
The Youngstown Clan held their 
regular meeting on Monday evening, 
October 12, at the Y. M. C. A. with a 
good representation present. The 
meeting was more peppy than usual 
as much interest is being shown in 
the coming football games.
A committee was appointed to pro­
mote a dinner dance with the Penn 
State Alumni. Those appointed were 
Walter Flanagan, F. C. Beede, Earl 
Wirt, and R. P. Woodward.
The following officers were elected 
to serve for the coming year:
President, H. E. Hildebrand, 195 
Ohio street, Sharon, Pa.
Vice President, R. L. Troescher, 034 
Fairgreen avenue. Youngstown, Ohio.
Secretary-Treasurer, Cramer Mars-

TRAINING FOR
R.O.T.C. GRADS
Reserve Officers Get Chance 
to Receive Graduate 
Training at Camps
Art Grads Are Members 
Of Tiffany Foundation
J. Denten Hogan and John W. Ken­
nedy, both graduates of the College 
of Fine Arts, hold fellowships at the 
Louis Comfort Tiffany Foundation,
Oyster Bay, Long Island, this sum­
mer.
Under the terms of the awards, 
both were admitted with the under­
standing that if their work after en­
tering the Foundation met with the 
approbation of the Advisory Art Com­
mittee, the period of the fellowsnips 
might be extended.
The purpose of the Foundation in 
maintaining a colony for artists is to 
bring together a group of able artists 
and craftsmen who w.ill work out1 handle the matter.
Of interest to alumni is the attend­
ance of graduates of the Engineer R. 
O. T. C. at camp this summer. The 
324th Engineers under the command 
of Col. E. A. Gibbs, were at Fort 
Humphreys, Va., from July 20th to 
August 9th. Among the personnel at­
tending were Second Lieutenants Wm. 
P. Cuthbert, Sidney G- Richards, Wm. 
II. Bell., Jr., George W. Dulin, O. A. 
Eichenlaub, II. W. Foster, L. H. Har- 
'ris, Jr., and Frank R. Shunttill, and 
Technical Sergeant Asbury G. Wil­
son. Lieutenant Harris was Adju­
tant. All the Carnegie men distin­
guished themselves. Asbury G. Wil­
son made a score of 324 out of a pos­
sible 350 at the rifle range on August 
;3, 1925. This is one of the highest 
scores that ha3 ever been shot on that 
range, the highest being 335.
Graduates of Carnegie holding En­
gineer Reserve Corps commissions 
who have not attended any training 
camp since June 30, 1925, and are de­
sirous of having 15 days training dur­
ing the present year which ends June 
30, 1920, should apply to the Head­
quarters, Third'Corps Area, Standard 
Oil Building, Baltimore, Md., for as­
signment to duty. Any officer who 
desires to take this period of active 
duty may choose his own date. It is 
suggested that several graduates get 
together. Any one desirous of join­
ing a party of this kind should write 
Capt. I-I. C. Lyons, Carnegie Institute 
of Technology, who will be glad to
theii* own particular problems assist­
ing one another by their various 
points of view. Frederick C. Claytor, 
assistant professor of Industrial Art 
at Carnegie Tech, is a member of the 
Advisory Art Committee of the Foun­
dation and a former resident artist in 
the colony. Wilfred A. Readie, assist­
ant professor of Applied Art, and 
Raymond S. Simboli, instructor in 
Architecture, are also members of the 
Carnegie faculty who have been for­
mer artists at the Tiffany Founda­
tion.

STRAND THEATER
The Headquarters of the 99th Di­
vision, Organized Reserves at the 
Westinghouse Building, Pittsburgh, is 
open - every Thursday evening from 
7:30 to 10:30. All reserve officers are 
welcome to the use of these offices. 
Regular meetings are conducted at 
8:30 p. m. under the leadership of a 
regular army officer who conducts dis­
cussions along the lines laid down in 
the texts and lessons of the corre­
spondence schools. The meetings 
listed for the present month are as 
follows: October 15, “Organization
of the Army”;. October 22, “Combat 
Orders”; October 29, “Military Law.” 
Beginning October 7, 1925, there 
will be held at the Hunt. Armory, 
Emerson and Alder streets, East
TELESCOPE
Now as we are in tne midst of our 
football season, with our major games 
at hand, they all have a big attraction 
for alumni, but possibly the greatest 
amount of attention is centered upon 
the annual classic between Pitts­
burgh's two major teams.
The Carnegie-Pitt game is not only 
a big day for Carnegie but is likewise 
an important event for Pitt. More so 
this year than ever since the dedica­
tion of Pitt’s new two million dollar 
stadium has been set' to precede the 
game. Prominent alumni, officials, 
and, faculty members of both Schools 
will take part in the exercises.
The Plebes’ team, as usual, will 
start the day with the Pitt Freshmen. 
Following this will come the Varsity 
clash ¦with all its glamor and color. 
The huge bowi will resound with 
echoes as the rival cheering sections 
strive to outdo each other in the 
honor of their teams.
Alumni and students will be 
more centrally located and closer to­
gether than any previous year. 
Carnegie followers have been allotted 
twenty thousand seats this year with 
a perfect view of the field. 
Alumni cheering should supplement 
that of the students as the two groups 
will be so situated as to merge into 
one. Since the two sections are so 
close together, the mad rush for seats 
in the student cheering section will 
be avoided.
Be sure you have your tickets and 
then be there to cheer the boys on to 
victory. Keep that “Old Tech Spirit” 
alive, and root for Carnegie.

About five years ago, Booth Tark-

induced to have one of his books 
transferred to 'the screen. The result 
of that experiment was one of that, sea­
son’s finest pictures, “The Conquest of 
Canaan.” The star of the picture was 
Thomas Meiglian who 'comes to the 
screen of Rowland & Clark’s Strand 
Theater, Thursday and Friday of this 
week in another story by the same 
author, “The Man Who Found Him­
self,” another prison tale written es­
pecially for the “good luck” star by 
Mr. Tarkington. Alfred E. Green, 
who directed Meighan in “The Bach­

“Pied Piper Malone” and other just as

the star’s productions, wrote the 
screen play. Virginia Vallie, who was 
Tom’s leading woman in “The Confi­
dence Man;’ heads the cast in this 
one, too. Frank Morgan, of the Broad­
way stage p’lay, “The Firebrand,” has 1 
the “heavy role.” John Harrington, 
Norman Trevor, Charles Stevenson, 
Julia Hloyt and Lynn Fontanne appear 
in the cast. “The Man Who Found 
Himself’’ is a semi-serious Cale of a 
happy-go-lucky son of a small town 
•banker who shoulders tne blame when 
his younger brother loses hea.vily in 
Wall. Street and then borrows oanlc 
funds to “cover up.” The result is a 
sojourn in Sing 'Sling. When he once 
more fatces the light of freedom, 
Tom’s outlook on life has been com­
pletely changed. His father is dead. 
Everyone turns his back 011 him. 
Even the girl who said she would 
wait, has married his business rivai. 
He's doad set against everything and 
everybody and falters front the straight 
and narrow path, but tho way Tom 
comes back is In reality, “The Man 
Who Found Himself.’ An educational 
news reel, and Harry Langdon in his 
latest comedy “Boobs in tho Woods” 
will be the supplementary attractions 
for these two days.

PLEBES DEFEAT 
W &TJ FRESH 7-0
Blocked Punt Results in'Only 
Score of the Entire 
Afternoon
With, the Plebe-W. and J. Frosli 
game ending in a 7 to 0 victor}' for 
Coach Anderson’s boys, Carnegie stu­
dents were not completely disappoint­
ed in their trip to Washington last 
Saturday.
The only score of the game was 
registered in the first quarter when 
Melziner, 230-pound tackle, blocked a 
Wash-Jeff kick. Lovewell fell on the 
ball as it rolled over the goal line, 
therefiy taking advantage of 'the one 
break of the game in Carnegie's fa­
vor. The extra point was made when 
Harpster threw a pass over the goal 
line to Liferic.
Because of the muddy condition of 
the field, playing was limited to fund­
amental football. Punting proved to 
be an essential in both teams’ attack. 
Handling of the ball was very difficult, 
as the field was a mass of mud and 
water, and! fumbles were numerous.
At the 'beginning of the second 
quarter, Carnegie was headed for a 
second touchdown, . when Hapster 
broke loose for a 30-yard run around 
his own right end, placing the ball on 
the opponents four-yard line. With 
goal to make it four downs, the ball 
was lost on a fumble, and the Vice 
Presidents handily punted out of dan­
ger.
Harpster and Captain Limeric car­
ried the ball most frequently for the 
Plebes. Both ran the W. and J. ends 
consistently for gains. Hrpster must 
also be commended for the'fine man­
ner in whiohi lie handled the team, 
consistently for gains. Harpster must 
and ball, his punts played a prominent 
part in the Plebe attack.
Tfhe linemen played good ball and de­
serve praise for their work. Frequent­
ly the W. and J. backs were thrown 
for losses because of the hard plug­
ging of the plebe forwards, Mielziner, 
star left tackle, made himself con­
spicuous with his many tackles and 
general good playing. Besides’block­
ing the pumto that paved the way to
the Plebe victory, be time after time
stopped the W. and J. runners behind 
the line of scrimmage. He proved 
himself the bulwark ’ of the Plebe 
defense.

BOXING CLASS SHOWS 
RAPID DEVELOP/WENT
Every Monday, Wednesday and Fri­
day afternoons at 4:30 the boxing 
class works out in the Gym. About a 
dozen members are reporting daily to 
the instructor, Purl Anderson, who 
puts them through a strenuous hour 
of work. Limbering-up exercises with 
the medicine ball and rope are in 
order with a little shadow boxing 
thrown in. The squad is then divided 
up and the afternoon topped off with 
a couple of fast rounds of boxing.
Many of the members of the class 
are inexperienced and most of the 
time is devoted to learning the funda­
mentals of the game. Corteui, Bitt­
ner, ana Pauliclc have shown up well 
and are going along at a good clip. 
Under the tutelage of Purl Anderson 
they should show a great improve­
ment in the course of a few weeks, 
and some4 real boxing will be un­
covered in the workouts.
Much enthusiasm has been shown 
by the class in the workouts and this 
interest should insure Carnegie of 
boxing team in the near future. Ev­
eryone interested should come out and 
help to make this class a success. 
Those interested, whether experienced 
or not, may join the class by seeing 
Dr. Esquerre at the Gym.

good for a distance of from five to ten 
yards more than Donahoe's. Likewise, 
the Red and Black had a decided ad­
vantage in running back punts.
The Plaid offense was flashy at 
times. Donahoe did! the greater part 
of the work, ably assisted by Beede. 
Frequently Steffen’s men flashed short 
gains, with the deceptive double 
p’asses and fake double passes for 
which they are so famous. Time and 
again the Presidents would tackle the 
wrong man, only to realize their mis­
take after itjlie man with the ball had 
found a hole for a few yards’ gain. 
Likewise the Tartans showed a su­
periority over W. & J. in interfer­
ence.
Carnegie started off the second 
half with a flash. Donahoe took the 
kickoff and returned it for the best 
returned punt of the game. On the 
fbrst play his good-sized gain looked 
impressive, and! was made possible by 
excellent interference. It was appar 
ent that something had taken place 
during the intermission, which had 
served as a stimulant to the Plaid 
warriors. Bmt then the accident oc­
curred and all was off.

TO LECTURE HERE
ONCE MORE!
Again Fate has sent the Carnegie rooters home from Little Washington 
to beat their swords into plow-shares and bide their time for another year. 
The game was closed because of a disagreement between W. & J. and Car­
negie officials as to the time of the two quarters remaining to be played. 
The Washingtonians insisting on.the regulation 15 minute periods, the referee 
stating that he would not be responsible for the conducting of the contest if 
full time quarters were adhered to, because of the darkness rapidly settling 
down, and the Carnegie players’ willingness to acquiesce to the referee’s sug­
gestion of shorter periods, is the summary of the dissention which ended the 
game in a 0-0 tie.
Of the lamentable incident that indirectly caused the contest’s un­
timely close, the least said, the better. May It speed the construction of con­
crete accommodations for spectators in many schools throughout tho country. 
People who pay $2.50 a seat for a few hours’ entertainment aro untitled to 
their personal safety from such as was the lot of those few unfortunates. 
We may thank God that it was not the grandstand that collapsed.
THE CHEERING
The cheering last Saturday was not at all what it should havo been. 
Cheerleaders got poor support from the student body, and dosorvod it. Co­
ordination was poor among tho former and the cheers wore not infrequently 
startod while a play was being callod. These conditions must bo greatly ini- 
proved tills week or Carnegio will bo sadly outclassed In rooting noxt Satur­
day. How about a big pop rally or bon-ilre to got things going?
ABOUT THE PLEBES
It is not ofton that moro evenly matched teams than the Carnogio Fresh­
men and those from W. & .1. moot on tho gridiron. The contest, proved to 
be a gamo of breaks with tho Plebes on tho big end of tho wish-bone. An­
other real test will come next Saturday.
FLAGSTAFF HILL
Once more this imposing hill takes its part in Carnogie’s al.hlotlcs. Tho 
cross-country squad is now ready for its first meet of tho season; with .Pitt 
next Saturday morning. A large crowd will probably bo on hand to watch 
Pitt’s Intercollegiate championship team fn action. Tho Tartans should 
put up somo real opposition.

C. C. TEAMS TO RUN 
PITT NEXT SATURDAY
Varsity and Freshmen Are 
in Good Condition For 
First Meet
The Cross , Country trials which 
wore to bo held last Friday afternoon, 
had to be postponed 011 account of 
the weather conditions. This is some­
thing very unusual, as tho hill and 
dalo men ordinarily pay 110 attention 
to Pluvious and his side-klcks. How­
ever, proverbially speaking, tho kit­
tens and canines were descending 
with such rapidity that it was thought 
best to give up tliougiits oL’ running 
trials until Monday.
The team is in good shape for its 
first, moot of the season, which comes 
next Saturday. On that day tho Plaid 
runners Avill be stacked up against 
those from Pitt, which latter team 
is not so formidable as was thought 
at the first of the season. As far as ex­
ternal conditions go, two moro evenly 
matched squads can not bo imagined. 
Both have practiced over the same 
course and both teams havo had ex­
pert coaching on the details of the 
route.
The freshmen squads of the two 
schools will be started' off on their 
I tliroe-mile jaunt beginning at tho foot 
of Industries Hill at 10 a. 111. sharp.
| At 10:30 the varsity teams will got 
the gun, and begin the fivo-milo grind.
Coach Halferty has not yet decided 
upon his lineup; leaving that to ho 
determined by the men themselves in 
the practice sessions of this weelc. 
Those who will doubtless bo found 
among tho varsity aro: Capt. Pock,
Salkla, I-Ilmes, McNair, Hobe, and 
Lustenbergor. Tho first five mon 011 
the plebe team will probably bo 
Haven, Allison, Fuller, Campbell, and 
Kinney.
As this is the first moet of tho 
soason to bo hold in this district and 
a largo crowd Is expected, both from 
Pitt and Carnogle, and tho Pittsburgh 
district as a whole.

LECTURESPanther Season Opens Soon
A number of Carnegie Htudents—a very litttited 
number, will attend the Ame'fl lecture, tat of the 
diseoiiTHCH scheduled for the year by J)r. Baker, 
on Friday night. On Saturday morning, aftor a 
restful night of conscious and subconscious an­
alysis and formation of opinion, they will sanntcr 
forth, jt^tjflably uHHiimhiK tlio air of the liitelli- 
gensia (for th'jjy will truly 1»; superior) ready to 
confer authoratively with the world on another 
moot question of the hour.
And why, “another'/” Because the'same very 
limited number of students have availed them­
selves of the opportunities for enlightenment of­
fered them in the past. The majority of our 
number, at mention of anything ho serious as a 
lecture on aeronautics, yawn, light up another 
cigarct and toddle unconcernedly away.
It’s a pity—to think that clever young Amer­
ica, who must develop into the captain and demi­
god of the future; should stand aloof from first 
hand contact with culture, learning and current 
thought.
The men engaged an our lecturers are not mere 
blah-blah artists, honored with invitations to 
speak at one of the more important educational 
institutions of America, and therefore prepared 
to blow the safety valve oil the hot air tank, in 
their efforts to move into the circle of the elite. 
They are acknowledged authorities, clipped from 
the columns of Modern Science and Modern Cul­
ture, bringing to ns an interpretation of the mod­
ern spirit, the modern intellectual discipline.
The intimate observance of typical personal­
ities afforded by these men, is the most valuable 
possible supplement to a study of modern litera­
ture, life and the cosmos in which we move.
A WORD TO THE BROTHERS
It is time that the American student awoke to 
a realization of the fact that football, and all that 
this use ol! “football" connotes, is not adequate 
preparation for the combat that follows gradua­
tion. The knowledge-thirst must be cultivated, 
just as some of our other thirsts have been, if 
our civilization, is to add anything except mate­
rial wealth to the social heritage left us by our 
forefathers.
A survey of college fraternity life, roveals one 
of its by-products to be purely negative in value; 
that is the spirit of clannishness. Even though one 
readily discounts the proverbial deop-oyed .en­
mity between fraternities as a myth of the pro­
fessors, no careful observer can fail to notice an 
aloofnoss and a very near complete estrangement 
between one group and another on the college 
campus. The average frutornity man on joys the 
fellowship of, and gains through association with 
but a. limited number of mon; this group begins 
and ends with his nctive body. Concrotoly. At 
Carnegie, either because of a sentimental “my 
brotluvrs-’ilrsl:, last mid best" attitude, or a well 
developed superiority complex, fraternity men, 
with the exception of the few personages who 
have the corner on campus activities and honors, 
hoop safely within their chosen folds and enjoy 
total alieuialiion from other groups.
This spirit of clannish aloofness is present not 
only iu the relations of students one with the 
other, but also between students and the faculty. 
Faculty members are never seen as humans; the 
word “professor’* connotes a more or less intel­
ligent policeman, whoso absence from his classes 
makes the heart grow fonder. There is little con­
sideration of the members of the faculty as men 
and women—as a selected group of interesting 
people from whom students may learn much out­
side the classroom routine.
A remedy is needed if there is to be an evident 
spirit of friendliness on the campus. Fraternity 
men could bring about a widespread fellowship 
by inviting members of the faculty and other 
fraternity men to their chapter houses. Such in­
vitations would result in reciprocation, and scores 
of new friendships would be made. Many loyal 
brothers might begin to realize that one frater­
nity doesn’t have any monopoly on the best men 
in school, and that in each group there are men 
whose associations would prove to be very much 
worth while. It might be whispered into the 
ears of faculty members that an occasional “open 
house” for students would not be amiss; there 
seems to be no reason why professors should not 
entertain students in their homes, and thus share 
in an effort; to bring about understanding and 
sympathy. By this method of promoting fellow­
ship, any narrow “clique fooling” would gradu­
ally bo dissolvod; the spirit, of things at Carnegie 
would improve proportionately.
ASSEMBLIES
Today the students of Carnegie will hold their 
second General Assembly of the year at the Car­
negie Music Hall. There is a program that has 
been arranged especially for the entertainment 
of the students and there is an hour left free that 
all may attend. Yet with all that has been done 
to make General Assemblies successful, they are 
still a problem.
The program at the last assembly was good, 
the attendance was good, but there was the usual 
general exodu^’ just before the end of the cere­
monies that left only a scattered few to join, 
rather mournfully than otherwise, in the Alma 
Mater. But then it was one o’clock and every­
body was starving. A good excuse, but not quite 
good enough.
A MOOD
Have you over experienced that empty feeling? When 
all tlio world seem« HA purposeless, Individuals are less 
then atoms, a universe of star dust, when nothing hut en- 
foobled curiosity lends ineontive to continued existence?
II, is sort of a week-end phenomena. Not necessarily, 
of course, hut most possible 011 a Friday, Saturday or Sun­
day nlglit. The week has been hard and unrelenting and 
now with rest in sight, I can settle back with a sigh of 
conlentmont and review my activities.
I light a pipe, take a puff, another, then a third—yes, 
I lie week was well spent, I learned much—throe more 
puffs—but what of it? Whither does all my expended 
onorgy drivo 1110? Am I like a lake 011 a mountain top 
accumulating potential energy from a dozen streams of 
knowledge?
In a way, yes. But tlio knowledge does not come 
gushing And foaming from the founts of tlio classroom. It 
must be painstakingly carried, bucket full by bucket full, 
up tho hillside and dumped, tepid and muddy, into the 
roHorvoir, ’Whore are tho cool depths and sparkling sands 
of youth? Safely hidden away under a sodimont of aca­
demic pedagogy.
1 must’ purge myself. Winds of doubt and discontent 
rufllo tho waters and tho,mud In washed away In spots. 
Tho water oloarii a bit but tho turmoil increases. So much 
energy! So much energy! I must expend some.
Divert It through a spillway, employ It usefully; hero is 
power, light, a gonlus more mighty than Aladdin's lamp. 
Thit to what ond? My lake Is In a tangled wlldornoss. 
There Is no demand for what I can produce. I 11111 unbal­
anced. I thought l was eompleto In myself and now dis­
cover the futility and Inacceiisablllty of my power.
Tho waters tumble madly down tho hillside and my 
friends call mo garrulous; they churn fiercely but quietly 
and my friends say I am moody. Tho telephone tinklos. 
Motion is suspended, waves and hollows defy gravity. But 
tho call is not for 1110 and the waterb grind more deeply.
A shrill feminine laughter and the waters twitch and 
bite the sand. It is only tho echo, the distant intimation 
of a Hashing asteroid, so powerful that it can control the 
tides.
A11 asteroid in the garb of a woman; a woman to talk 
to, to hold in one’s arms, to kiss—she can still the tem­
pest, sweep aside the wilderness, and bring employ to all 
this vast energy. She can also cast down the barriers 
and giggle sillily as the suddenly unleashed waters flood 
forth, only to be again gathered with much pain.
It is for her that all this power is being stored up and 
expended carefully. With her beneficial influence, cool 
rains add their purity to the waters; golden and rosy 
clouds lend softness to the rugged surroundings. She 
brings peace and quiet and the waves lap softly on a re­
freshed shore. She, is most potent but where is she?
Substitutes will not suffice. They do not understand. 
They jar the waters from underneath, spew the lava of 
envy into the lake, and throw pebbles on the surface to 
watch them skip.
I range the cosmos for her and find suns, hot and flam­
ing, cold and indifferent, but all ununderstanding. I see 
hor now, a flying vaporous comet. I clutch her and grasp 
hut dust.
Classes are dismissed at, eleven-twenty for as­
semblies. It should not take longer than fifteen 
minutes for students lo go from their classes to 
the Music Hall, and yet. the last assembly was not 
begun at ton minutes of twelve because of tho 
number of people arriving late. If tho program 
were begun at; eleven-forty-llve; it might always 
be over before even the hungriest would demand 
his lunch.
Why not have tho General Assembly hour set 
for eleven-forty-live and everybody there on 
time? If the program is still too long the com­
mittee can make it shorter. Sophs, get your 
Plebes to Assembly promptly. Upperclassmen, 
cease to count 011 a tardy assembly. Let a thou­
sand voices join in the Alma Mater. Give the 
General Assemblies a real chance.
October 10, 1925. 
Editor of the Tartan:
To a greater or les? degree, there 
is invariably a wave of criticism each 
new college term when the returning 
students find an objectionable change 
in the affairs of the school. It is a 
natural expression of opinion, bo it 
pro or con, as to the success of the 
change. Surely these protests de­
serve consideration for they come 
from students who are vitally inter­
ested in the welfare and success of 
Carnegie. This, is such a protest.
A goodly portion of male students 
at Carnogie are compelled by circum­
stance to earn part of their expenses 
as they go. Heretofore a great many 
boys have had the co-operation of the 
administration. Some forty-flve of 
the most deserving were given part- 
time employment at tho Unibn and 
tho Inn. This year they And this 
method of sustenance completely 
abolished and are compelled to seek 
such moagre work as, they can flnd 
away from the campus.
It certainly appears that the ad­
ministration. has lost interest in tho 
student» who lack financial backing. 
Yet statistics prove that the majority 
of honor students are helping them­
selves through collego. Perhaps therO 
is a logical reason for refusing assls- 
ance'but I, for one, fall to soe what 
it is.
It; is hard to bolioyo that tlio Union 
was not a paying proposition last 
yoar. Wo who stood In tlio long linos 
at meal time are a trifle doubtful. But 
now—tho crowds that, come to bo 
norvod, are feeble indeed. Could it 
bo a sort of unitod—protest?

EURYTHMICS CLASS FOR
CHILDREN TO BE OPENED
Classes in Dalamo 13u,rythinics, a 
method of musical education founded 
by Jaque Daloroze, will be conducted 
by Miss Susan T. Canfield of the Mu­
sic Department for children at 10 to 
14 years, every Tuesday at 4:30 p. m.
Dalcame Eurytlimics is a method of 
musical education conceived and de­
veloped by Jaque Dalcroze, a Swiss of 
French extraction, lie conceived the 
idea of eurytlimics in 1S9S and Inis 
gradually ¡developed it to its present 
stage.
Eurytlimics aims through the feel­
ing of rythans throughout the body to 
develop musical individuality;. ,The 
elements with which it deals are phys­
ical movements representing various 
tone lengths or tone values and their 
combinations. A sound is represented 
by a step while the movement of the 
arms indicate time signature. By 
learning to recognize and! realize note 
groups, a growing knowledge of mo­
tive and music form, is developed sim­
ultaneously with hearing coordination 
and concentration.
In France Eurytlimics is used in 
connection with the opera ballet and 
in Germany it is used at the Reinhart 
Theater. It is employed for the most 
part educationally in England and the 
United States.
Gems
Gems, such as topazes, aquamarines 
and amethysts are still popular In this 
country, according to reports from the 
gem-cutting center, Idar-Obersteln, 
Germany, but there has been a decided 
falling off In Interest here in synthetic 
stones of low quality.

The Week 
in the 
World’s News
LESLIE P. BEEBE
Germany and France are again at 
peace with one another. From the 
day that Wilson first propounded the 
League of Nations idea, the contem­
porary world has been seeking the 
rainbow of permanent peace. Again 
and again the blackness of distrust, 
envy, and hate—have blotted out the 
vision, and then suddenly we see 
again the trophy that the world is 
always hoping for—Peace. Nov/ once 
more it shines at Locarno, where a 
treaty has been signed by Great Bri­
tain, France, Germany, Belgium, and 
Italy.
The agreement has not been offi­
cially reported, but we know some of 
the provisions, at least the more im­
portant ones. Rhine zone between 
Germany and France is to he set up 
and demilitarized, and both have 
pledged never to cross it for the pur­
pose of attack. And with it comes 
another clause in which both England 
and Italy guarntee to go to the as­
sistance of the country that is the 
victim of violation of the past. In 
other words, France has the support 
that she has been asking for, for 
years. Now she can begin to forget 
her constant fear and get hack to 
normalcy. Germany is to become a 
member of the League ot Nations at 
the date this agreement goes into 
force, providing the parliaments sign 
the treaty. From all indications, they 
will sign.
Up in this little town of Locarno on 
Lake Maggiore in Switzerland, there 
has been signed what may be one of 
the great papers of history or merely 
another grotesquerie, another pledge 
soon to be broken. But no matter 
how sceptical we may be, or how 
much we may laugh and say "just 
another piece of paper that means 
nothing,” it is well to remember that 
world peace and world co-operation 
can only come through years of effort 
and striving. Even if this looks as if 
it were going to pieces soon, the goal 
is worth striving for, and every bit 
of this same striving brings us nearer 
the goal. This may sound like mere 
sentimentalism, more of the Bollyanna 
talk, yet how much ground is gained 
toward world co-operation by sneers 
and laughs. Peace can only come 
through by the constant co-operation 
of every one and it would seen^as if 
a forward step had been taken.
Freshman Baiting is Beneath
Dignity of Chinese Students
There are more Chinese students 
attending Carnegie this year than at 
any previous time during the history 
of the school. Many of these stu­
dents are doing graduate work, hav­
ing already obtained degrees in Chi­
nese’or American Colleges.
It is interesting to hear the impres­
sion that Carnegie has made on these 
students, many of whom have at­
tended Chinese Colleges. One of the 
first things which surprised them was 
Plebe Regulations. In "China a col­
lege student would be considered very 
undignified if lie were seen humiliat­
ing a fellow student, consequently 
plebo regulations are unheard of.
The curriculum of study is very 
similar in point of time required for 
its completion, however, ttie Chinese 
stress the importance of physical edu­
cation and two hours a day of some 
form of athletic game is part of the 
regular college course as compared 
with Carnegie’s three hours a week 
of P. T.
It was surprising to learn that fra­
ternities exist, and are indeed a vital 
element in Chinese college life as 
well as in American colleges. The 
fraternities go by names which are 
chosen from the Chinese alphabet as 
contrasted to American Greek letter 
fraternities. The fraternity of Chi­
nese college life is more on the order 
of a club during their college days, 
and the members in a measure are 
much closer to one another than is 
true of the American fraternities. 
Instead of pledging freshmen each 
year, the active chapter consists of 
the same members throughout their 
lives. Its name on the campus is 
maintained by memoriams or dona­
tions. Each member is assessed a
fee of from $40.00 to $50.00 a year 
throughout life, and each are pledged 
to write a letter to the other mem­
bers once a* week during their active 
school life. When a social get-to­
gether is held, it takes the form of a 
feast instead of a dance which is the 
usual form of diversion in American 
fraternities.
Carnegie’s Campus in its present 
inmature state did not especially im­
press the Chinese students. This is 
largely due to the fact that all Chi­
nese colleges are situated in the 
scenic parts of China. The buildings 
are of Chinese architecture and com­
bine at the same time all of the mod­
ern improvements which go to make 
up an efficient college.
The Chinese boys have bd'en im­
pressed by the friendliness of Ameri­
cans toward them. However, it has 
beeii rather hard for them to become 
accustomed to the American fashion 
of self-service. In China the colleges 
have a great many servants who take 
care of the student’s wants. A col­
lege of 400 students would have up­
wards of seventy servants. The bill- 
of-fare is also far better than the av­
erage American college student could 
afford. Five dollars a month being 
sufficient for the best board the coun­
try can afford.
The majority of the Chinese stu­
dents who are attending school in 
Pittsburgh (30 some in number) pos­
sess government scholarships, which 
were awarded on the basis of high 
scholastic standing. The scholar­
ships are good for from three to five 
years study in American and Euro­
pean schools. Carnegie should feel 
honored that her fame as an institu­
tion of learning has become such as 
to attract so many of these men.
I Thrashing Machines
The flail was the only instrument 
for thrashing grain known In very 
early times. The Romans Invented a 
machine called the “trlbulum,” a 
sledge loaded - with stones or Iron 
drawn over the grain sheaves by 
horses. The first modern thrashing 
machine was that Invented about the 
year 1732 by Michael Menzies, of 
Edinburgh. Scotland.
England is facing a very grave 
crisis. Her capital is coming to the 
United States in amounts great 
enough to cause very grave concern 
in investment circles. The chances 
for profitable investment in the Brit­
ish Isles are becoming smaller for 
business is very poor and as a result 
profits are small. Tho labor situation 
is the crux to the spirit of unsettle- 
ment. Labor demands are getting 
more and more stringent, - thus jeo­
pardizing business. Costs nro high 
and there nro 0110 million and a quar- 
tor capable mon who are out of work 
so that; instead of producing and con­
suming these 111011 are only consum­
ing, thus making tho situation even 
more difficult. Labor does not seem 
to realize that by making their de­
mands so stringent they aro killing 
their own cause, and whether they 
are right or wrong iu their demands, 
with business stopped, Cliey suffer. 
With the Capital coming here it 
moans less business in that country 
and as a result the industries of Great 
Britain are laying off more men every 
day. The workman is ‘‘cutting off his 
nose to spite his face.’’. In the mean­
time the uneasiness grows.
Sugar in History
It is said that sugar was first taken 
to Europe from Asia in 625 A. D., 
and it began to be received in large 
quantities by the middle of the 
Eleventh century. Early attempts to 
cultivate the sugar cane in Italy did 
not succeed. The Spryilards and the 
Portuguese carried the sugar cane to 
the American continent about the 
year 1510.
Bees as Constables
Bees as constables were used In a 
village in Prussia. When a free-for-all 
fight developed among the patrons the 
landlord rushed out and brought back 
a beehive. After putting on a mask 
lie released the bees. The Insects did 
their work swiftly and thoroughly, and 
within a minute every one of the 
combatants had fled from the battle­
field.—Family Herald.
