Tech Swamps Geneva in Annual 
Track Meet at Schenley Oval
Kelley Equals School Record
No Competition for Plaid
Tech romped away from Geneva 
Saturday at Schenley Oval in their 
annual track meet, taking twelve fast 
firsts out of the fourteen events for 
a score of 90XA points to Geneva’s 
32%. Plaid men won every event ex­
cept the 120 yard high hurdles and 
the discus throw.
Moon and Kelly each won two 
events, while Hammann won one and 
tied for first place in another.
Kelly did noble work in the hundred, 
covering the distance in only 1-5 slow­
er than flat time and equalled the 
school record. Tech’s distance men, 
Cavett, Cooper and Greenlaw, com­
pletely outclassed Geneva’s entries, 
winning the half, mile and two mile 
easily. In the two mile event the 
Geneva men threatened, Extell mak­
ing a fine finish and coming in second.
Moon won the shot put with.a dis­
tance of 35.6 feet, and the hammer 
throw with 122.2 feet. Stultz took 
the pole vault at 10 feet 6 inches, 
and then vaulted an exhibition of 11 
feet. He just missed setting a'new 
school record at 11 feet 5 inches, but 
could not quite clear the bar at that 
height.

SIGIVIÂ ALPHA EPSILON 
GIVES BREAKFAST DANCE
In fulfillment of open house night 
of the Tecli fraternities and as a Com- 
pus week novelty Sigma Alpha Ep­
silon held a breakfast dance at their 
chapter house. After enjoying the 
social events in and about school that 
evening the active members and alum­
ni gathered at the house where danc­
ing commenced at one o’clock. Over 
seventy couples were present and the 
spirit of the party had not subsided 
a single bit when the dance was con­
cluded at five o’clock.
Music is a large part of any dance 
and at this time the fraternity was 
very fortunate in securing N. How­
ard’s New York orchestra which has 
been playing at the Fort Pitt hotel 
the last winter and spring. It is felt 
that this combination cannot be beat 
for jazz music anywhere.
At five o’clock a dainty but sub­
stantial breakfast was served under 
the direction of Joyce the caterer.
The event was acclaimed such a 
success that every one is anxiously 
looking for its repetition, as well as 
the whole Campus Week, in future 
years. The patrons and patronesses 
were:
Dr. and Mrs. D. T. James, Dr. and 
Mrs. L. O. Grondahl, Prof. and Mrs. 
F. M. McCullough. Mr. and Mrs. T. 
H. Ross.
On the following Sunday the regu­
lar monthly alumni dinner was held. 
The success of the dance was a popu­
lar theme of discussion again.
ENTHUSIASM GREAT 
AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY
Campus Week started ofi1 with a big 
general assembly on Thursday at 
noon. It was the best assembly of 
the year in both attendance and en­
thusiasm. The Plebes carried their 
enthusiasm over from the morning, 
giving vent to it by cheers and yells.
After a selection by the band, Frank 
Haaren, the new graduate manager, 
spoke. He said that there was a new 
era of athletics at Tech, which was 
already showing results in the new 
spirit among the students. He also 
gave the warning that while athletics 
are very important the students 
should not take them as an excuse to 
neglect studies. His chief message 
was to talk Tech at all times and to 
boost the school in every way pos­
sible.
W. W. (Dixie) Wood sany a num­
ber of southern songs which were 
well received. The jazz orchestra 
also gave some selections, among 
which a saxophone solo by E. R. 
Hughes was especially good. A new 
Tech song which was sung by the 
writers was very good.
President Hammerschlag spoke of 
the present tendency for the four 
schools to come into closer contact. 
He said that to accomplish big things 
cooperation is needed. He also spoke 
of the memorial gym which is being 
planned and for which he is trying to 
get appropriations from the trustees.
Miss Virginia Siedle gave a number 
of humorous stories and songs in dia­
lect which were well rendered.

SIGMA RHO INSTALLED 
AS CHAPTER OF 
BETA THETA PI
Saturday afternoon Sigma Rho So­
ciety held its final meeting and closed 
its records as a local organization in 
Carnegie Institute of Technology, to 
become the Gamma Iota Chapter of 
Beta Theta Pi Fraternity.
Sigma TlTro TENI organized By~a 
group of six men in the early spring 
of 1906 to aid in the advancement of 
“Tech” and to bring together in a 
friendly way a band of congenial men 
who would go out from the Institution 
filled with a lasting interest for their 
Alma Mater. During its fourteen 
years of existence in “Tech” it has 
endeavored to live up to this policy 
with the best interests of “Tech” at 
heart, and has chosen to affiliate its 
aims and purposes with those of Beta 
Theta Pi Fraternity.
The initiation and installation took 
place at the Twentieth Century Club 
on Saturday afternoon when thirty-six 
active and thirty-two alumni members 
were admitted into the Fraternity. 
The chapter was installed by the Psi 
Chapter of Beta Theta Pi: Dr. Fran­
cis W. Shepardson, National presi­
dent, Director of Registration and 
Education, State of Illinois; George 
II. Bruce, National Secretary, Horace 
Mann School for Boys, New York 
City; Bertram S. Stephenson, District 
Chief of Pennsylvania, Pittsburgh 
Manager M. A. Hanna and Co.; Wil­
liam L. Graves, District Chief of Ohio, 
Professor of English at Ohio State 
University; Dr. II. S. Baketel, District 
Chief of New York, Physician and 
Editor of Baird’s Manual American 
College Fraternities; Judge II. Wal­
ton Mitchell, of the Orphans’ Court at 
Pittsburgh, President Board of Trust­
ees at State College, Pennsylvania; 
Dr. Thomas S. Baker, Secretary of 
Carnegie Institute of Technology; Dr. 
John C. Acheson, President Pennsyl­
vania College for Women; and K. M. 
Marquis, President Pittsburgh Alumni 
Association of Beta Theta Pi, Man­
ager Cleveland Western Coal Com­
pany.
Thirty-two chapters of Beta Theta 
Pi Fraternity were represented at the 
installation ceremonies. The installa­
tion was followed by a banquet given 
by the Pittsburgh Alumni at the Uni­
versity Club at seven-thirty p. m., at 
which there were about two hundred 
in attendance.
Sunday afternoon the chapter held 
open house at its new chapter house 
5549 Forbes Street, where tea was 
served from three to six p. m. In the 
evening the members attended, in a 
body, the services at the Sixth Pres­
byterian Church, where Dr. Benj. F. 
Farber, a member of Beta Theta Pi 
Fraternity, delivered an address to the 
new chapter on “Friendship”.

CAMPUS TREE PLANTING 
MEMORIAL TO 
TECH’S HERO DEAD
A very impressive ceremony, pre­
sided over by President and Mrs. 
Hamerschlag, took place on the 
campus adjoining the Division of Arts 
on Friday when two groups of five 
trees each, were planted in memory 
of students and alumni who made the 
great sacrifice on the altar of Liberty 
in the late war.
Mrs. Hamerschlag, who addressed 
the assembly said: “A memorial of 
brass or granite, after the first inspec­
tion, ceases to attract, but our inter­
est in a living thing is perpetual; 
cliérefore these irees will'be the most 
fitting memorial to our soldier dead. 
They will be a living testimonial and 
with every renewal of tliejr verdure 
will come a renewal of our gratitude 
for the splendid record these men 
have left their Alma Mater.
In all the years to come, these trees 
will stand here to testify, that in the 
day of the world’s greatest peril, 
Tech’s sons were unafraid and that 
her bravest and her best went out with 
gallant hearts to battle for liberty”.
The first tree was then set in place 
by President Hamerschlag, while Mrs. 
Hamerschlag filled in the first spade­
ful of earth and the planting was fin­
ished by Dean Tarbcll. President and 
Mrs. Hamerschlag presided at the 
planting of each of the ten trees, while 
students and alumni filled in the earth around them.
It was the most significant feature 
of Campus Week—forming a new link 
between the administration and the 
student body and pledging the alleg­
iance of both to the dead to “carry

TO CAMPUS WEEK EVENTS
Three hundred and fifty graduates, 
former students, faculty, trustees, and 
seniors, attended the first general 
Alumni Federation Banquet at the 
Fort Pitt Hotel on Saturday evening, 
May 15. It was a fitting climax to the 
Campus Week activities.
At the speakers’ table, the guests 
included President and Mrs. Hamer­
schlag, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor Allder- 
dice, Mr. and Mrs. C. B. Connelley, 
the Hon. and Mrs. J. R. Macfarlane, 
Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Winters, A. K. 
Oliver, William Frew, Mr. and Mrs. 
George Clapp, Hon. and Mrs. Josiah 
Cohen, Judge J. I). Shafer, and John 
S. Herron.
During dinner, about twenty mem­
bers of the 1910 Glee Club, under di­
rection of W. C. Dorrington, leader 
of that year, sang several selections, 
class cheers were given, and black­
faced comedians put on a short 
sketch.
W. W. Powell, President of the 
Alumni Federation, acting a : Toast­
master, called on President Hamer­
schlag for the first talk of the eve­
ning. He said that in the last fifteen 
years, the growth of Tech was ulmo 
phenomenal and that the time i; n'-ar 
at hand when the four schools will !>•• 
merged in one general alumni associa­
tion, with no dividing line, which 
union will bring about a sfronrer as­
sociation for the good and weKare o '

Winning Streak Continues
“Skinny” McCaw, premier Plaid 
twirler, after waging a gruelling 
pitcher’s contest for 11 innings with 
Stanton, of Geneva, in a game be­
tween Tech and Geneva College last 
Friday afternoon, walked up to the 
plate in the last half of the 12th in­
ning for his tips, when one man was 
down and Irwin had just singled to 
middle, and clouted the ball to deep 
left field for a three bagger, scoring 
Irwin for the winning run and defeat­
ing the plucky Geneva nine by a tally 
of 3-2.
Geneva’s defeat, Friday afternoon 
counted four victories for McCaw, he 
having only pitched four games, lie 
won the only game from West Vir­
ginia and Grove City also having won 
the Westminster and Juniata games. 
“Skinny” is credited with 17 strike­
outs in the Geneva game bringing his 
total number of strike-outs up to 43.
Campus Week must have thought it 
was some relation to Christmas, judg­
ing from the weather that came with 
it. Friday morning was cool, but 
there was some hope that the sun 
would warm things up. However Old 
Sol failed to appear and it was no 
fit weather for baseball but Honus 
wouldn’t stand to disappoint the alum­
ni and students.
Joe Doherty, Tech's lead-oN' man, 
small and swinging left-handed, a 
vexatious problem for any pitcher, 
opened the game with a walk but was 
thrown out attempting lo steal sec­
ond. Ray Doherty got to first on an 
error by the second baseman. Durkin 
laid down a safe bunt, Ray making 
second. Godden (lied to conter-field 
and Ray advanced to third but Durkin 
was caught at second. Johnston then 
singled to right, Ray Doherty and 
Godden scoring Tech’s first two runs.
After the first inning Stanton be­
came very effective and up to the 12th 
period allowed only four widely scat­
tered hits, lie was backed by good 
fielding, the only errors for Geneva 
occurring in the first and twelfth in­
nings.
McCaw held the visitors hltless un­
til the sixth, when Stanton hit a hot 
grounder tit McCaw’s feet and got to 
first safely. In the next period Loef 
lor got a hit. McCaw weakened in 
the eighth. Gales got a single thro 
second. Stanton got a free pass. AI 
lison singled to right scoring Gales. 
Harr then hit a scorching grounder 
between third and short, Stanton scor­
ing the winning run. Geneva then 
went scoreless for the rest of the 
game, altho in the 11th inning after
Thomas had been hit by the pitcher 
and Harr had singled to middle field, 
matters might have taken on a serious 
aspect for the Plaid players, had 
Thomas not tried to make third on 
Harr’s single. The decision at, third 
was close and was contested for a 
while by Geneva. Other than for this 
incident it seemed that the game 
would continue until called on account 
of darkness, for they were going three 
up and three down.
However in the last half of the 12th 
frame, the tide turned. Oakley got 
on first through an error by the see 
ond baseihan, but was thrown out try­
ing to steal. Irwin, who seems to 
know before hand .when a hit is need­
ed, singled to middle field. Then ev­
erything rested with “Skinny” Mc­
Caw. Twelve innings wore enough 
for any pitcher, “Skinny” throught, so 
he drove the pill far enough over the 
left fielder’s head to allow Irwin to 
score the winning run and to get cred­
it for winning his own game.

a score of 20 to 1.
The weather was adverse to base-

Grove City baseball nine came back, 
having suffered a defeat at the hands 
of the Tartans, last Wednesday after­
noon, when they battled with the Tech 
nine for two hours in a scoreless game 
and were forced to quit on account of 
darkness.
The fielding of both teams was bril­
liant and sensational, both pitchers 
being hit freely. Moon got credit 
for 11 strike-outs and allowed only 
five hits.
In the third inning Tech had 
chance to score. Joe Doherty got a 
walk and Ray singled, with only one 
man out. But Durkin and Godden 
both /lied out. Again in the eighth 
inning, Kay Doherty, who was first 
man up, connected for a three-bagger. 
Durkin knocked a fly over the third 
baseman’s head but he ran back and 
got it and threw Ray out attempting 
to make home. I n all other periods of 
the game Grove City was not threat­
ened at any time.
Grove City was helpless at all times, 
Moon either struck them out or al­
lowed them to hit easy balls to the 
field, although some were trouble­
some. Moon’s good pitching and the 
line support which he got warrants 
attention.

BACK HIM UP I
Up to the time of the Campus Week celebrations our President has been 
subject to severe criticism—not the constructive type but such that is very 
harmful. It is hoped that the injustice done to him will be recognized by 
those who infringed and also that hereafter they will modify their form of 
criticism. May the frequent incorrect rumors which have circulated over 
the Campus be discontinued and all of us unite our purposes in a single di­
rection.
At both the assembly and the alumni banquet President Hamerschlag 
expressed his views clearly on the gymnasium question. So few of us recog­
nize the fact that he is not at liberty to do as he pleases, which applies to us 
as well. Is it not that we are letting the,task to him alone? Can we not aid 
in convincing the trustees on the Carnegie Corporation that a new gymn is 
essential? This can be done by starting the proposed gymnasium fund which 
would be more convincing than any petition, expressing our sentiment nu­
merically.
The purpose of this comment is three-fold: (1) To show the incorrect­
ness of attitude; (2) to show how we can help; (3) as a plea to refrain unjust 
remarks in the future, to restore perfect harmony. The ability of our Presi­
dent is generally unrecognized. Can we not all get together—as the 18,000 
alumni are and pull for a better and greater Tech? Back him up I
WITH ONE ACCORD
On Friday afternoon, Immediately after the seni or-faculty game, about 
live students wore pushing Lint roller around the baseball diamond. Two 
faculty members left their seats on the stand and hurried to help to push 
the roller. Students, faculty, shoulder to shoulder against the wheel were 
pushing in one direction and for one purpose, A new era has arrived. Ev­
erybody is striving to accomplish one purpose, id est, to do everything for 
the good of Tech, The faculty is beginning to understand the students and 
Geniofior the students the faculty. Thus, since more energy will be ex­
erted In one direction that therefore means greater speed, greater momentum 
and greater fame for "Dear Old Tech”.— Contributed.

first on Ray Doherty’s error and scor­
ed on Hoelzler’s double to middle field. 
After the fourth inning only two men 
reached first and Fawcette was the 
only man that got as far as the third 
sack.
Tech started out with two runs in 
the first inning, took three more in the 
next period and then failed to score 
during the three following frames. In 
the sixth, however, they began con­
necting with the pill again, crossing 
the platter for three more runs. It 
was in this stanza that Wiggins, in 
the pitcher’s box, was replaced by 
Wright and Steve Hoelzer relieved 
Reaney from behind the bat, on ac­
count of a badly bruised index finger. 
The next period was a repetition of 
the former and in the eighth the 
Lairds capped the climax of their con­
sistent swatting by making six hits 
and scoring nine runs.

C. M. E. S. HOLOS BANQUET
A very enjoyable and well attended 
banquet was held by the C. M. E. S. at 
the Lincoln Club, Tuesday May 11, 
1920. Every mechanical was there 
from the Sophs to the Alumni, from 
Bill Pfouts to Professor Trinks.
Promptly at 7 p. m. the sumptious 
chicken dinner began to disappear and 
one hour later nothing was left ex­
cept the programs and favors.
At 8:01 Mr. Blenko exhibited, de­
scribed and explained to the society 
his latest invention, the Bullometer. 
(See 1920 proceeding of A. S. M. E.) 
The device which measures both qual­
ity and quantity, was thoroughly test­
ed during the banquet; and stood up 
well (due to its safety factor of 100) 
during the speeches of Messrs Bollen 
and Pfouts.
The evenings entertainment was 
started by some of Professor Trinks' 
stories. Mr. Ely—latest acquisition of 
the Mechanical department showed a 
bunch of card and sleight-of-hand 
tricks which would have made Thurs­
ton envious. His ring tricks proved 
conclusively that the laws of the im- 
penatrability of solid matter are false.
Speeches, stories and informal talks 
were ably given by Professors Estep, 
Blaisdell, Bolton, Mr. Pfouts, Mr. Dal­
las, and several of the Alumni. Mr.
Dallas’ talk about his experiences in 
Burma and the problems of the Amer­
ican Engineer there, was especially 
interesting. He also showed a wond­
erful collection of paintings of Burm­
ese people.
The entertainment was concluded 
by music. Professor Trinks and Ely 
with the aid of a piano gave us sev­
eral selections of pure unadulterated 
music, which seemed to literally ooze 
from the piano.
Finally elections were held. Mr. 
Blenko was elected president with Mr. 
Henderson vice president. Mr. Fitz- 
immons secretary and Mr, Anthony 
treasurer. The policies and outlook 
for next year was discussed. And it 
was 32 when the peppiest “Techiest” 
C. M, E, S. that, ever was closed.
Here’s to a big O. M. K. S. next,

WESTMINSTER NEVER HAS A CHANCE AGAINST TECH(Concluded from page 1.)
Tech’s excessive hitting made it a 
long-drawn-out contest lasting almost 
three hours.
“Skinny” McCaw was moundsmnn 
for the Plaid and to the Presbyterians 
he was fathomless, allowing only five 
widely scattered hits and striking out 
twelve of the Blue and White men. 
The Plaid’s well-wielded bat which 
yielded 21 hits and their speed up 
when on bases, which accounted for 
twelve stolen bags was the other fea­
ture of the game.
.loe Doherty again came to the lore- 
front, crossing the plate lice times, 
making two hits and displaying an un­
usual knack in base-running, getting 
three stolen sacks. Ray Doherty, God­
den, Durkin and Irwin were the other 
batting stars of the day. Irwin and 
Lynn each got a three-bagger and 
Johnston, Godden and Lynn all cont 
nected for doubles.
Westminster’s only score came in 
the fourth inning when Eddy got on
. . . and at the Naval 
Academy, Annapolis 
cA fact:
At Annapolis, as with Navy 
Officers generally, Fatima is by 
far the largest-selling cigarette. 
This is true both at the Officers’ 
]\^ess in the Academy and in the 
town itself, while among the 
midshipmen Fatima is especially 
popular. y? .
FATIMAA Sensible Cigarette
"Just enough Turkish”
The fact that the Naval Cadets are picked men, representing every Stale in the Union, makes this one of Fatima’s strongest endorsements.Here at Annapolis as elsewhere, men have discovered that cigarette character depends on the right pro­portioning of Turkish tobacco.So Fatima owes its popularity to the fact that it contains not too much nor too little, but just enough Turkish—just enough to taste right, 
always.

PREP SCHOOL SMOKER 
ATTENDED BY CROWDS
On, Saturday night a smoker was 
held at the Union and that winded up 
the program for Campus week. The 
attendance was exceptionally good and 
the whole affair was a success from 
every viewpoint due to the committees 
hard work.
An orchestra, well supplied with in­
struments that can cause anybody to 
.smile, besides making everybody’s feet 
move briskly if necessary, first enter­
tained the audience by playing a few 
lively hits, after which Cunningham 
the new Science cheer-leader led in 
cheers. Then came a member of the 
.soft voice sex and sang a few good 
songs and in the meanwhile sang di­
rectly to certain individuals. Others 
only wished that she should have chos­
en them as a partner to sing to, while 
some wished to have been captured by 
the Germans at that specific moment 
rather than to be present at the Tech
berger as Secretary-Treasurer, was 
composed of several sub-committees, 
as follows: On the Entertainment
Committee—Miss Austin, Miss Kline, 
Mr. Weber, Mr Schnurer and Miss 
Bruce; Mr. Meixner arranged for the 
music; Mr. Dermitt, Mr. Robinson, 
Mr. Gillespie and Miss Bruce compris­
ed the publicity and social commit­
tees; Miss Kline, Mr. Weber and Mr. 
Schnurer were in charge of decora­
tions; Mr. Weber made arrangements 
for large posters announcing the 
dance.
Due to a most grievous oversight 
on the part of the printer, Mr. Karl 
B. Weber’s name failed to appear on 
the program: This fact is much to be 
regretted as Mr. Weber’s untiring ef­
forts in bringing this dance to a suc­
cessful issue deserve full recognition 
and commendation. He represented 
the Division of the Arts on the Com­
mittee on Arrangements. One of his 
alloted duties was to look after the 
refreshments. On the afternoon of 
the dance, the caterer 'phoned him 
that he must unavoidably disappoint 
him on his previous promise to supply
“Catching the Elusive Bacon”
Union at that specific moment (bash­
ful, you know). Then came a little 
fellow and although so little yet his 
voice was so loud and he made a big 
hit with the fellows due to his good 
songs and the beautiful motions that 
he presented.
In the meanwhile cigars, doughnuts 
and soft drinks were passed around to 
the fellows thus helping to satisfy 
their digestive senses as well as their 
auditory and optical senses.
Trophies were then presented to the 
winners of the inter-scholastic meet. 
Gold, silver and bronze medals were 
awarded to the winners in all events. 
A large silver cup was given to the 
school awarded the greatest number 
of points and individual silver cups 
were given to the winners of the inter­
scholastic relay team.
Moving picture were then shown 
after which Mr. Martin gave a mod­
ern oriental dance. Thus the affairs 
of the campus week came to a finis 
and it will be remembered by every 
one.
NIGHT STUDENTS”DANCE
The foyer of the School of Applied 
Design was the scene of a light-heart­
ed company Friday evening, May 7th, 
upon the occasion of the Fourth Inter- 
Night School Dance. This successful 
function, by far the largest of its kind 
ever held by the night students, eclips­
ed the three former Inter-Night 
School dances.
The excellent jazz music afforded 
by Maggio’s first orchestra was but 
one of the features that lent to the 
evening’s gayety. Various humorous 
solos and droll antics of members of 
the orchestra brought forth peals of 
laughter from the crowd. It was 
thought that the music for one of the 
dances would be furnished by the or­
chestra playing that evening at the 
Carnegie Union, this music to be 
transmitted by wireless, but this plan 
was not carried out.
The Social Committee, realizing 
that one of the necessary details was 
to get the students of the three 
schools to mingle and to promote a 
feeling of friendship, scheduled two 
Paul Jones dances. These were re­
markably well carried out under the 
direction of Messrs. Karl B. Weber, F. 
M. Highberger and Joseph' A. Gilles­
pie.
The Committee on Arrangements, 
of which Mr. 0. E. Bee served as 
General Chairman and F. M. High-
the fruit punch and cakes. This 
meant a great deal of scurrying and 
wild-goose-chasing about the city at 
the eleventh hour in search of eats 
for the crowd, with the result— 
“Dutch” has a knack of getting re­
sults—that a bountiful supply of re­
freshments appeared at the dance that 
sam eevening.
Another regrettable fact is that no 
mention was made of on the program 
of one of our most solicitous patron­
esses—Mrs. Ellsworth Dean, who so 
kindly honored us with her presence 
Friday evening.

THIRD TENNIS OUNCE 
TO BE GIVEN IN
SCIENCE ASSEMBLY HOLDS 
IMPORTANT ELECTION
The third of the tennis dance series 
will be given Saturday night in the 
Union. The two previous dances will 
be remembered as great successes, 
every one admitting a good time.
It seems to be doubtful whether or 
not everybody recognizes the fact that 
these dances are held alone to support 
the team. The team this year has al­
ready vanquished Grove City, West 
Virginia, and Penn State, the latter 
two victories occurring on foreign 
courts. There is no question but that 
those who support the dances are sup­
porting a winning team.
The management is expecting a 
banner turn-out. Special features will 
make up an attractive program. The 
music as yet remains unannounced.

INTER-SCHOLASTIC
Schenley High School scored an im­
pressive victory in the annual inter­
scholastic track meet held by Tech 
on Schenley Oval.
Schenley held the lead all the way, 
finishing with 69 points, Parkersburg, 
W. Va., who scored 51, coming in for 
second honors.
Twenty schools were entered in the 
meet, Central High of Erie am? Scott 
High of Toledo, coming the furthest.
Scott captured the relay race in 
fast time, this being the only event 
in which they were entered.
Following is the standing by 
schools:
Schenley 69, Parkersburg, W. Va., 51; 
McKeesport 18, Central High, Eerie. 
Pa., 18; Morgantown 13; East Liver­
pool 10*, Pittsburgh Academy 8, Ava­
lon 5, Wellsville 4, Allegheny 4, Pea­
body 3, Sewickley 2%, Monongahela 
City 2, Wilkinsburg IV2.
Last Wednesday a very important 
Science Assembly was held. The Sci­
ence School candidate for president 
of the Student Council was elected. 
H. S. Nichol was chosen. W. C. Cun­
ningham was elected to the Student 
Activities Board.
A straw vote was taken on the sub­
ject of changing a Plebe hat. The 
assembly voted to a change to some 
distinctive hat, such as a Scotch cap.
W. C. Cunningham was elected 
cheerleader from Science School and 
Burser was chosen assistant.
It was voted that the ten dollars 
from each student’s fee, which goes to 
activities should be divided in the pro­
portion of 8 to 2 between athletic and 
non-athletic activities.

THE SPIRIT OF CARNEGIE 
By “Bill”
Chas. M. Schwab gave an address 
recently in which he spoke of the 
“Spirit of Carnegie”. “Carnegie’s 
success”, he said, “was founded upon 
his spirit of approval”. Everyone ad­
mired that spirit and loved Carnegie’s 
life because it represented such a spir­
it.—But reflect for a moment.—How 
much of this spirit of approval is 
found in the school which bears his 
name? Particularly the School of 
Science. Hundreds of young men en­
ter this school every year, confident 
of their ability and sure of their plans. 
The administration enters them all— 
knowing that they cannot be taken 
care of no matter how good they are 
as a class. Half must lose out by the 
end of the first year and ultimately 
only one out of ten graduates. Most 
of these men come from a class of 
people who need their help. They get 
only one chance at a college education. 
When they are dropped from the insti­
tution, they lose that chance. Their 
parents lose confidence, and they are 
deprived of higher education just be­
cause a school has a policy of entering 
two or three times the number it can 
handle. Even the men who stay are 
seldom commended for their work. 
They are rarely if ever enthused by a 
spirit of approval on the part of the 
faculty or administration.. In short 
the majority of the men entering the 
school are dismissed and condemned 
while the remaining ones are simply 
tolerated, the aim being to graduate 
only a “select few” to represent the 
school. It is easily recognized as the 
purely selfish program of a young 
school. But Carnegie never meant 
that most of the men coming to its 
door should be sent away, robbed of 
their confidence. He intended the 
school to help every man, however 
humble, to make the best possible per­
son out of himself. The school will 
never supply this help, nor grow in 
true worth until it adopts a more con­
siderate program toward young man­
hood—until it approves and encour­
ages the work of every entrant in the 
"Spirit of Carnegie”.—Written by a 
Junior in good standing in the School 
of Science.---------D----------THE NEW DAVIS
Keith vaudeville is to have a most 
unusual group of attractions for the 
bill at the Davis Theatre afternoons 
and evenings next week. Beginning 
Monday afternoon, May 24, a compos­
ite program of nine acts will be pre­
sented with Thomas E. Shea, the dis­
tinguished classic legitimate star, as 
the titular headliner. Mr. Shea will 
be aided by a small cast of noted 
players, including Edwin Holland, 
Daniel Garrett and Gertrude Valen­
tine, ¡11 “Spotlights” a condensation of 
his three most masterful characteriza­
tions. In these he will give his audi­
ence unique, graphic and character­
istic flashes of Bulwer Lytton’s “The 
Cardinal”, Shortran Eckmann’s “The 
bells”, and Robert Louis Stevenson’s 
“Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde”.
The second attraction of import­
ance is the program of the forthcom­
ing week will be Ivan Bankoff, the 
nimble and graceful premier from the 
Russian Imperial Ballet, who, with a 
corps of assistants, including Mile. 
Phebe, will introduce his original con­
ception, “The Dancing Master”.
Harry Delf, a popular Broadway fa­
vorite fro mthe forces of musical com­
edy, is perhaps the third important 
feature of the program. He comes 
from “The Rainbow Girl” and the Co­
han Revue, to entertain with songs of 
his own composition, a lot of humor­
ous chatter, and amusing dancing.

HONORARY FRATERNITIES TO 
DANCE FRIDAY NIGH!
The Annual Inter-Honorary Dance 
will be held in the Union Friday night 
May 21«t. The honorary societies of 
the three men’« «chool« will partici­
pate in the dance thin year, namely: 
Tau Beta Pi, Dragon, Alpha Tau, Gar­
goyle, Delta Skull, Alpha Alpha Nu, 
and Lawtochfrarie.
TECH CIRCUS 
(Continued from page 1.) 
higher knowledge could SL quickly 
transform themselves into snake- 
charmer«, fire-eaters, sword-swallow­
er«, bare-back riders, etc. still remains 
a mystery. These facts and their re­
sult will remain, however, one of the 
brightest events in the annals of Tech 
history.
Every circus must have its parade 
and the Tech ¡tea were not lacking in 
this respect. Promptly at three o'clock 
the performers assembled in the field
ahead. Next fall another campaign 
will be started, and the alumni were 
asked to stand behind this and put 
it through.
Mr. Hammerschlag then paid trib­
ute to the various Directors, Deans, 
Secretary Baker, Mr. Leete, Mr. Con- 
nelley, the former Deans of Margaret 
Morrison, Miss West and Miss Smith, 
Dr. Baker, Mr. Orbin.
Mr. Powell called on Mr. Herron, 
Mrs. Alderdice, Mi-. Oliver, Mr. Til- 
brook, Judge Shafer and Mr. Con- 
nelley, all of whom made short talks.
Mi1. Powell then asked for expres­
sions of opinion on the question of 
alumni representation on the Board 
of Trustees and the Administrative 
Council of the School. Mi-. Herron and 
Mr. Hamerschlag both spoke in 
favor of this, and a motion from the 
floor from Wm. II. Sands, Jr., was 
seconded and carried: “That a com­
mittee be appointed to wait on the 
Board of Trustees and the Adminis­
trative Council of the School, to ex­
press to them the desire of the Alum­
ni Federation for representation on 
the Board of Trustees as well as the 
Administrative Council.”
Mr. Overend spoke on the Athletic 
situation and called on Mr. Haaren,
"M. M. Plebe Banner Chase”
and paraded before the stands. From 
this time until victory of the U. S. S. 
Science over “Hell’s Terror” there 
was not a dull minute in the whole 
afternoon.
Next came a Jazzbo saxophone 
quartette. They may not have been 
much on harmony, but oh, boy! when 
it came to speed and endurance!
Events from this time on came so 
thick and fast that it is impossible for 
ye scribe to remember all of them in 
order, but the high spots may be men­
tioned. A dozen clowns were con­
tinually rolling about, getting “bean- 
ed” with bottles and otherwise pro­
viding a fine line of low comedy for 
the stands, while the police patrol did 
exciting social well fare service on all 
sides of the field. The thrilling runa­
way scene, while not on the program, 
served as a sad reminder of days B. P.
The ladies’ baseball game, while 
we’ve never seen ladies in action on 
the diamond, proved to us that the 
Junior Mocha have thoughts of other 
things besides retorts and machine de­
sign. We would suggest, however, 
that they apply some of their “stress 
formulas” to determine the elastic 
limit of a skirt draw-string. This 
would prove a great aid to all weak 
hearts in the grandstand.
The “bare-back” riding act was well 
named, even though the equestrienne 
did not succeed in mounting. The un­
expectedly sudden demise of the steed 
proves that he was not accustomed to 
windy days on the cut.
One of the most humorous attrac­
tions was the clown band which rent 
the air in true circus fashion, only one 
member approximating the tune, the 
others “carrying on” to their own 
fancy with much gusto, nevertheless.
At the height of the festivities ihe 
tent pole was found to need either 
cleaning or paint, we never discovered 
which, and a member of the troupies­
sayed to do the “job”. Armed with 
a bucket, high hat and stepladder, he 
started for the scene of operations, 
and much comedy ensued.
Wild animals and bathing girls, 
strikers and hypnotists, purveyors of 
cold tea and clowns of every imagin­
able description kept things going un­
til the last thing on the program, a 
mix-up between a battleship and a pir­
ate schooner with the skull and cross- 
bones at the mast ’n’everything.
Of course the buccaneers were beat­
en—and their ship burned, which 
event literally capped the climax with 
a “blaze”, at least, if not one of glory.
The success of this, the first “Tech 
Circus”, certainly presages a wonder­
ful exhibition next year, when the stu­
dents, with the benefit of this year’s 
experience, will be enabled to stage 
one far surpassing this.

He spoke of the plans for a war 
memorial gymnasium, which has been 
talked of since the war, but each time 
the funds were not sufficient to go
the new graduate manager. Mr. Haa­
ren told of Tech’s ten straight vic­
tories and asked for contributions to 
the Athletic fund. Pledges from the 
floor were given and about $5,000 
raised with many promises of pledges 
to be doubled.
As a different kind of donation, Mrs. 
Allderdice offered a silver cup to the 
Margaret Morrison girl winning the 
tennis championship- for three con­secutive years.
