THE WAYNESBURG GAME
Tech opened its foot-ball season Saturday with 
Waynesburg, and though we scored a victory, the 
results were not altogether satisfactory. The de­
fense was fairly strong while the offense showed 
plenty of room for improvement. Let it be said 
right here that this account is not intended as a 
knock but is aimed as a fair criticism from the 
standpoint of a student interested in the welfai’e 
of the team and the school.
The fumble of the kick-off was unfortunate; but 
a little more practice at catching punts will remedy 
that defect, or at least diminish it. As soon as 
Tech got the ball, two attempts were made to gain 
on line plays, but they were both failures and the 
ball was kicked. In this as in all the subsequent 
on-side kick and forward passes the ends and backs 
seemed to get where they belonged at the proper 
time; but the line did not do its share as most all 
the kicks were hurried. The end runs were in the
main good for gains, while line plunges were not!so successful. Another touchdown would in all 
probability have been made if there had not been 
so many substitutions in the second half, resulting 
in quite a few misunderstandings as to signals.
In the main, it can be said that the team work 
was better than any we have had before; but still 
plenty of room for improvement and the spirit and 
interest shown was of the best.

M. M. S. S.
Owing to the fact that no correspondent had been 
elected, the M. M. C. S. was not represented in the 
Tartan lasit week. We now make our most gracious 
bow to the student body. We welcome both the 
new and the old students and ask the co-operation 
of all that we may make our part of the paper as 
interesting and attractive as possible.
School opened on Monday, the 21st, but nothing 
much happened the first day except noisy and affec­
tionate greetings on the part of old students, and 
mucn staring on the part of the Plebes. Incidently 
we parted with the larger share of the cash earned 
during the summer by strenuous labor in kitchen, 
sewing and art rooms! Some of the girls were so 
loath to part company with the Fair God that they 
refused to register until the second or third day.
Tuesday found us all in classes, getting acquainted 
with our new teachers and curriculum. The Secre­
tarial, Dressmaking and Design girls seem to be 
settled already, but the Household Arts girls go 
about with lagging steps and perplexed wrinkles 
between their eyes. Deal gently with them, girls,— 
they have troubles that ye wot not of. The respon­
sibility of housekeeping and cafe management rests 
heavily on their young shoulders.
Our teaching force has been greatly enlarged this 
year. We thought our old Faculty just about the 
best possible, but we find it very much improved by 
the new additions. Mrs. Gibbs has charge of the 
department of Costume Design, and Mr. Church, of 
the Secretaríais. Mrs. Church is teaching Plebe 
Science. iMiss Diescher’s place in the stenography 
room has been taken by Miss Chandler. Miss Nick­
erson, the only new teacher in the Household Ants 
department, has the Plebe cooking and Dietetics. 
Miss Fisher occupies Miss Stutz’s old room and is 
presenting a very interesting course in English liter­
ature. Dr. Martin is the new instructor in Hygiene.
Morrison Hall, (the new residence house for M. M. 
C. S. students, is now open, with Miss Purmort as 
resident teacher. It is situated at Northumberland 
and Denniston avenues, and is a very comfortable 
and attractive home. Several of the girls have al­
ready taken up their abode in ithe Hall, among them 
being Miss McMullen, Miss Johns, Miss Beymer, 
Miss Carlin, Miss Day, the Misses Kemple, Miss 
Flinn and Miss Atwood.
The Dressmakers look very trim in new blue uni­
forms, and the Costume Design girls are quite stylish 
in white ones. We hear that the Secretaríais are 
about to blossom out in uniforms, also. Heaven 
help us! How are a hundred and twenty-five girls 
to dress in one room, all at one time, before one 2x4 
mirror, and get to assembly on time, clothed and in 
their right minds?
Three of the Household Arts girls this summer 
put into practice the teachings of their department 
by running a cottage at Chautauqua. We hear mar­
velous tales of the wealth they accumulated, but 
judging from the superior airs of Miss Carlin and 
Miss Sawhill and the rotundity of Miss Pfeil, we 
fear their chief acquisitions were experience and 
avoirdupois.
The H. A. Juniors look very lovely in their new 
uniforms, which are just like the Seniors, except for 
the tie. When passing each other on the stairs, it 
is somewhat hard to tell the classes apart .(Wouldn’t 
it be sad if we really did get mixed?) However, if 
you can’t always tell a Senior by her uniform, you 
can always recognize her by the dignity of her bear­
ing and her burdened expression!
On Tuesday, September 29th, the Seniors wel­
comed the incoming class at an informal afternoon 
tea given in the Faculty rooms. Palms and golden- 
rod made the rooms lovely, and yellow nasturtiums 
brightened the tea table. The white dresses worn 
by the Seniors were at once distinctive and decora­
tive. The officers of the class received the guests, 
and the other members of the class assisted in intro­
ducing the girls. Miss Ihmsen and Miss Merrill 
poured tea.
The Juniors, having assumed a motherly attitude 
toward the Plebes, advised them through the bulle­
tin board, not to attend the ¡Senior Tea. But the 
Plebes evidently felt able to decide such matters 
for themselves, and disregarding the Juniors' advice, 
came in large numbers. A very pleasant time was 
spent getting acquainted and trying to learn each 
others names. We all hope to know each other 
better before many moons.
Miss Lucile Sawhill entertained a party of friends 
at her brother’s drug store last Thursday to see the 
parade. A buffet luncheon was served during the 
afternoon. The guests included Miss Carlin, Miss 
Pfeil, Miss Griffin, Miss Merrill, Miss McKee and 
Miss Sheets.
A NEW MEASURING OR LINEAL COUNTER.
The C. J. Root Company, Bristol, Conn., manufac­
turer of counters, has brought out a new type of the 
instrument known as a measuring or lineal counter, 
the function of which is to measure and compute the 
output of a machine by feet or yards. It has neither 
lever, key nor springs, being run by gears entirely, 
the figures moving at the proper time. A shaft ex­
tends through the back on the right hand side, con­
necting with a roll for measuring cloth, paper, wire 
or other product. The roll is designed to be at­
tached to the shaft, a foot or yard in circumference, 
as the standard of measurement requires. The de­
vice counts to 1,000,000. It dimensions are 9 
inches long, 2% inches wide and 1% inches thick. 
The figures are % inch high. Its shipping weight is
6 pounds.

As a rule we have not honored any of our students 
managers or captains with a biographical sketch 
when their pictures have appeared on our cover page, 
but this seems a favorable time to shatter precedent 
and besides that the temptation is too great. It 
need not concern' us as to the exact year of his birth 
besides, if any are at all curious the desired infor­
mation can in all probability be obtained at the 
reference room. Neither do we need to concern 
ourselves as to the motives that impelled him to 
sever his relation, pleasant or otherwise, with Geor­
gia Tech and cast his lot with us.
Most any pleasant morning in October a couple 
of years ago a slender young gentleman of “Beau 
Brummell” appearance and a soft southern accent 
could be found conning some professor into excusing 
him from any old kind of work on the ground that 
he had already covered the ground at Georgia Tech. 
Along later in the day of any of the aforementioned 
mornings he could be found making a series of in­
vestigations of the proper size of sand to pass 
through a 10-mesh sieve. Little did any one think 
that this young man of the earnest manner and the 
soft accent would blossom in one short year into 
the bustling foot-ball manager who with cigar at 
angle and handkerchief rampant announces that “All 
you fellows who want anything had better speak up 
as I can’t wait forever.” During the past summer 
he held a position of trust with a mining company 
at Bisbee, Arizona. The trust that he guarded so 
zealously being a wheelbarrow and shovel.
To Buck, however, must be given the credit of the 
first season of business methods applied to Athletics 
and the fact that he was unanimously re-elected 
manager of the foot-ball team this year is an earnest 
of the confidence reposed in his energy and ability.
While we have no fault to find with the cheer 
leaders last Saturday, we think there could be a big 
improvement before the next game. Why not have 
a little more cheering practice? If we would do 
this everybody would at least know the yells, and 
we wouldn’t see as we did in one -of the Pittsburg 
papers as we did after the last game that the visi­
tors ran us a close second in rooting. Silence is 
golden, but when it is applied so persistently as it 
was last Saturday after each of our touchdowns 
it loses a large part of its value.
What has become of the Civil Society or of the 
Crucible Club or the Inventors? It hardly seems 
possible that they have all died, yet there doesn’t 
seem to be much going on among them. We can’t 
afford to let them languish, so get busy, somebody, 
and get things livened up a little bit.

PLEBE PROTEST.
The article published in last week’s Tartan under 
the title of .lunioi Side needs a few comments*
1st—The Sophomores and Juniors had entire con­
trol of the Field-day schedule. They arranged the 
contests to suit themselves. Therefore, they should 
not do the “baby-act” over their defeat.
2d I he fiag-rush was not the contest upon which 
the observance of the so-called Decalaw depended. 
The Upper-classmen did not specify any contest at 
all, until after the games were over. They showed 
a lack of the spirit of fair-play in this act, as in other 
acts throughout the afternoon.
A Plebe class foot-ball team is being organized. 
Come out, everybody.
With such strenuous events as registration day, 
class-fight, and sesqui-centennial week completed, the 
schools in general are ready to sit up and take no­
tice, as it were. In the freshman ciass, the officers 
have all been elected and we have been relieved of 
some of our superfluous (?) cash in that veritable 
nightmare, class-dues. We are at last ready, if not 
willing, to commence work in earnest.
And after all, that is what we are here for. The 
first thing which we wish to attain for our school, 
our class, and ourselves is scholarship. After that 
may come such delicate accomplishments as foot­
ball, base-ball, entertainments, and social affairs. 
And if our standard of scholarship is high, are we 
not all the more justified in having our good time 
and do we not enjoy it all the better?
And just a word along the line of sports. Remem­
ber, fellows, there is going to be a great ’Varsity 
foot-ball team this year and there is going to be a 
great class team also. So we will have plenty of 
room to show our Tech spirit and support the teams. 
But bear in mind that it is our school first and our 
class second. Our school is of prime importance.
But I have preached enough for one day, and can 
only say Jiat the wind will blow from my direction 
again as soon as the occasion offers.
Did we see our boys on Thursday? Well, I guess 
yes. It is authoritatively reported that they tried 
to butt the Fourteenth Regiment out of its tracks. 
Doubtless it is just as fortunate for that military 
body that their attempt was not very decided, for 
whatever Tech undertakes it accomplishes.
THE PARADE.
Tech Well Represented—Dr. Hokanson Makes a Hit.
“Greater Pittsburg Day” of the iSesqui-Centennial 
celebration will long be remembered by all those who 
saw the magnificent and instructive street pageant, 
that was the chief feature of the day. The parade 
began on time, and except for a few delays during 
its passing everything went off without mishap, and 
according to schedule. Aside from the mere amus­
ing and spectacular features of the parade, it was a

decided success from a technical standpoint. The 
gradual processes in the evolution of methods and 
equipment of the different departments of the city 
government were very accurately and carefully work­
ed out. The entire procession was notable for dig­
nity and consistency.
Long before the time of starting the streets in the 
vicinity of the ones over which the parade was to 
pass, were thronged with people hurrying to find 
some point of vantage from which to obtain an un­
obstructed view. It seemed as though all of those 
from the downtown district were sure they could 
find the right place by walking up the line of march, 
and those from the outlying districts were just as 
sure that their going downtown would be a means 
of their securing the desired location. For all the 
hurrying and pushing, it was a gay holiday crowd.
When the first of the mounted police had passed 
clearing the way, cheer after cheer went up from the 
crowd as the notable visitors in carriages were recog­
nized. Closely following them came the first of the 
City of Pittsburg Division, the Police. This, to­
gether with the Department of Fire, proved one of 
the most interesting and instructive features, de­
picting by costume and apparatus, the gradual evo­
lution of these branches of a city’s equipment from 
the days of yore to the present time. The same ex­
cellent method of arrangement prevailed in the His­
torical Division.
The Tech factor first showed itself when the Semi- 
Military organizations were in the public eye. The 
Boys’ Brigade was passing at the time. From the 
left hand end of a line of rather small boys was 
heard a deep and familiar voice ringing out in com­
mand. Linderman, in a spic and span uniform, was 
at his old post. But a moment had passed until the 
graceful and somewhat rounded form of Alan Bright 
clad in a blue uniform with lots of gold lace and do- 
hickies about the shoulders, came into sight. Cap­
tain Bright, if you please, carried his sword daintily, 
but spoiled the ensemble effect somewhat by his 
endeavors to take and keep up the regulation length 
stride. After lots of more little boys came the for­
eign societies with their queer and striking uniforms.
The Educational Division proved of decided inter­

8THE TARTAN
est. The boys from the elementary schools deserve 
honorable and special mention for their marching 
and general appearance. After the High School sec­
tion came our pride, to be spoken of later in detail. 
The Pittites, alias The Hill Climbers (please notice, 
the U. of P. were all in Philadelphia, where they 
belong) made a good showing in their caps and 
gowns.
After the Labor Division came the more spectacular 
Manufacturing. Floats formed the greater part of 
the display, and each was representative of the firm 
that entered it. Among the most striking of these 
was the H. J. Heinz’s, drawn by 30 black horses, each 
led by a uniformed outrider, and that of the Pitts­
burg Brewing Company, drawn by 16 horses, four 
abreast. The Invincible Carpet Cleaner Co. had a 
complete power plant, consisting of a gasoline en­
gine and a dynamo in operation to furnish current to 
run the carpet cleaners.
In the Transportation and Commercial Division, the 
Pennsylvania Railroad and Boggs & Buhl deserve 
the blue ribbon, the former for what appeared to be 
the most carefully made and constructed float, and 
the latter for the magnificence of the 44 horses draw­
ing their float. After scores of beautiful and costly 
displays had gone, the memorable parade of 1908 had 
passed up the avenue and into history.
When the Tech participants had finally- fought 
their way over to the place of meeting in Allegheny, 
they were formed into line by Dr. Hokanson. ‘ Now, 
we will wait and see what is what,” was the first 
remark of the commander upon seeing the line com­
pletely formed. The • waiting continued for some 
time, but at last, when the order came for marching, 
the parade was well under way anfl the journey of 
eight miles between the two solid walls of people 
began. All along the way the number were cheered, 
and when the crowd would give “three cheers for 
Hamerschlag,” Dr. Hokanson would hold the horse’s 
head and his own a little higher, looked out of the 
corner of his eye to see if his plaid sash was on 
straight, and bowing right and left acknowledging the 
cheers in a dignified and altogether fitting manner. 
The onlookers fearful lest the marchers* should go 
without any lunch, showered them with eatables. 
The showering was literal; Griffith received a basket 
of grapes on his head; Speer caught a tobie in his 
mouth, and Laurie literally snatched a pickel out of 
the air, and they all became expert in catching fruit 
in their open umbrellas. “Chuck” Charles, rather 
/than trust entirely to what came his way, received 
bounteous supplies from the fair sex on the side 
lines. Harrison went in to the tickler snatching 
business early on the march, and by the time he was 
through had accumulated enough to satisfy most 
any one. Benny Watrous acted as chief marshall, 
and was assisted by Hammond, Charles, Bunny Ma­
son and Jamieson. The color bearers who led the 
van, were Mitchell, Snyder, Keck, Taggart, and some 
one else undistinguishable in the crowd. The only 
criticism of the appearance of the main body of fel­
lows was the lack of any sort of a uniform. Plaid 
caps or at least something of the same would have
made a much better showing. Following was the 
float with “Silent” Murphy, Post, Hobbs and others 
on board This was truly impressive, but the pas­
sengers looked intensely bored at the whole pro­
ceeding.
HARBOR IMPROVEMENTS AT CLEVELAND, O.
As the volume of ore, coal and grain carried by 
the Great Lakes has steadily increased in the last 
few years, larger vessels have been found necessary. 
The majority of those now in use are more than 600 
feet long, and the harbor facilities at the principal 
lake ports are no longer adequate to accommodate 
them. Among the cities which have taken steps to 
improve and develop the internal harbor systems 
afforded hy the rivers is Cleveland, Ohio, at the 
mouth of the Cuyahoga River. Improving this river 
means not only conserving vested interests, but de­
veloping the entire valley of the river into advan­
tageous and economical sites for manufacturing in­
dustries and railroad terminals.
The Cuyahoga River pursues a very winding course 
for several miles through the heart of Cleveland. It 
has only one branch, known as the Old River Bed, 
which runs westerly for about a mile from a point a 
few hundred feet inside of the harbor mouth. The 
river originally was narrow, shallow and crooked, but 
has been widened, deepened and straightened, and 
projects are now pending that will remove the re­
maining natural obstructions in the course of the 
stream.
The provision of movable bridges has naturally 
been an important consideration, and more than 20 
highway and railroad bridges now span the river. 
These structures were originally nearly all of the 
center pier swing type, and for the most part ham­
pered the passing of large vessels. A number of 
these have now been replaced by rolling lift bridges, 
which leave the channel unobstructed. iSuch a one 
is that recently substituted by the Baltimore and 
Ohio Railroad Company for its bridge across the Old 
River Bed on the line of West River street. It is a 
long span single leaf Scherzer rolling lift bridge and 
wTas completed and placed in service a few months 
ago.
This bridge replaced a swing bridge used by the 
railroad company for many years to reach the ex­
tensive ore docks on the north side of the river. The 
old bridge had its center pier on the west side of the 
river, with an approach extending well out into the 
channel on the opposite side. In the new structure 
the main supporting piers on which the bridge rolls 
are placed on the east side of the river, with the 
front or rest pier on the edge of the far side of the 
channel, making the entire width of the river availa­
ble for navigation. A particular advantage of the 
rolling lift bridge is that it makes available all dock 
space adjacent to the bridge; the disadvantage of 
the swing bridge in this respect is especially apparent 
when the main pier is located at one side of the 
channel, as it was in this instance.

---------------------------------------------------

YNG YTHYTI
The bridge carries a single track and has a mova­
ble span measuring 230 feet from center to center of 
bearings, the longest span single le^if bascule bridge 
in the world. The clear channel for navigation, 
measured Detween faces of piers, is 210 feet. The 
total length of steel work, including the short plate 
girder fixed approach span at the rear end of the 
bridge, is 334 feet. The width is 20 feet from center 
to center of the trusses, and the minimum clearance 
above the ties is 22 feet. The counterweight is of 
Portland cement concrete carried in steel boxes in 
the plane of each truss, the bridge being, counter­
weighted so as to be at rest in all positions.
The bridge is operated by two 75-horse power al­
ternating current electric motors. In the operator’s 
house are placed the controller governing the motors 
and an independent switch which operates the sole­
noid brakes on the motors. The power is applied in 
the operation of the bridge by pinions on the main 
operating shaft engaging with fixed racks placed on 
independent supports outside of each truss. Indi­
cators in the operator’s house show all positions of 
the bridge during operation and also the positions of 
the end latch. ¡Signals are placed at each end of the 
bridge, interlocked with derailing switches and with 
the end latch and main operating controller, so that 
the bridge cannot be operated until these signals 
have been set at “danger” and the derailing switches 
opened.
The substructure consists of one front pier, three 
main piers carrying the track girders on which the 
bridge rolls, and an abutment supporting the rear 
end of the plate girder approach span. These piers 
are of concrete carried on piles. The bridge was 
erected in its open position without interefering with 
the railroad traffic over the old swing bridge or the 
opening of that bridge to pass vessels. The front 
pier of the new bridge was constructed under the old 
swing span on the channel side of the center pier. 
The main piers of the new bridge were built under 
the approach to the swing, the superstructure being 
erected on these piers so as to provide ample clear­
ance for the operation of trains over the old bridge 
at all times.
The bridge was constructed under the superintend­
ence of J. E. Greiner, assistant chief engineer of the 
Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The de­
sign was prepared in accordance with the railroad 
company’s specifications for material and workman­
ship for steel structures and the design and erection 
of bridges. The design of the superstructure, oper­
ating machinery and electrical equipment was the 
work of the Scherzer Rolling Lift Bridge Company, 
Chicago, which company also maintained a general 
consulting engineering supervision over the con­
struction and erection of the bridge. The substruc­
ture was designed and built by the railroad com­
pany. The contract for the superstructure was ex­
ecuted by the King Bridge Company, Cleveland, and 
the erection of the steel work by the Pittsburgh Con­
struction Company.

RUST PROOF COATING .FOR IRON.
For several years past scientific papers throughout. 
the country have contained articles commenting 
upon the inability of zinc as a coating to protect 
modern steel and iron products for any length of 
time from rust. Agricultural papers have been con­
demning zinc-covered or galvanized fence wire, and 
the trade is ready for something to take its place.
A process has recently been discovered by a Minn­
eapolis inventor for producing a coating which has 
the characteristics of lead in resisting acids, and 
the characteristics of zinc in resisting rusting action. 
He found that his electrical process enables him 
to make an alloy of le*ad and zinc which is decidedly 
positive to iron. Only a fraction of one per cent, 
of zinc will permanently alloy with lead when em­
ploying methods hitherto in use, and such a small 
fraction of zinc does not alter the negative potential 
in the lead. His method provides a sufficiently large 
per cent, of lead in the alloy.
The process consists of passing a heavy electric 
current through a comparatively small cross section 
of the plating metal while it is in a molten condition. 
In practice the electric current used is an alternating 
current of high frequency, and the amount used is 
about 1,300 amperes to a cross section of three-eighths 
of an inch of metal.
The inventor states that when lead is subjected 
to this process, this current passing through the 
metal creates a molecular disturbance, which per­
manently changes its physical condition, and gives 
it new and distinct properties. One of the important 
new properties is its affinity for iron and steel, mak­
ing it very suitable for coating these metals. An­
other is that it will unite with zinc and make a new 
alloy, very valuable as a coating metal, on account 
of its favorable electrical quality.

GAS ENGINE POWER PLANT, PORT WASHING­
TON, WIS.
Thie features of the equipment of the Milwaukee 
Northern Railway which has attracted especial at­
tention from the engineering public and users of 
power is the fact that the motive power of the road 
is furnished by gas engine-driven electric generating 
units of a size heretofore unknown for purely trac: 
tion service.
The location of the main power plant is at Port 
Washington, on the harbor front, where the handling 
of coal, unloaded directly from Lake Michigan steam­
ers at the company’s docks is very economical and 
convenient. Two buildings comprise the power plant 
proper, one for the producers and one for the engines, 
generators, switchboards and protective apparatus. 
Both structures are of concrete, steel and brick con­
struction and placed approximately fifty feet apart. 
The gas supply main is run outside of and along the 
entire length of the power house from the producer 
plant.
The generating units are three in number, each of
1,000 K. W. capacity, two of which are now installed; 
the third will be set up shortly. Each unit consists 
of a twin tandem horizontal double-acting Allis-Chal- 
mers gas engine direct connected to a 405 volt, 25 
cycle Allis-Chalmers alternator. Although the rating 
of each unit is given as 1,000 k. w. both engine and 
generator were designed with large overload ca­
pacities, the engine being capable of developing up­
wards of 2,000 H. P. and the generator having a cor­
responding capacity. Each engine has four cylin­
ders, 32 inches in diameter by 42-inch stroke, and 
will operate at 107 revolutions per minute.
The valve gear is of the standard Allis-Chalmers 
cut-off type and the engine operates with constant 
compression, thus tending to insure smooth running 
under the highly variable loads to which it is sub­
jected. The inlet gear is extremely simple, consist­
ing of a main inlet valve of the single beat poppet 
type, eccentric operated, thus insuring long life and 
quiet running. The mixture of the air and gas is 
thoroughly effected before entering the cylinder by 
means of a patented annular mixing chamber located
under the main inlet bonnet; the design and opera­
tion of this device is such that, at the instant of 
closing of the main inlet valve, there is practically no 
explosive‘mixture left outside the cylinder. The gas 
valve is of the double beat poppet type controlled by 
a variable lift rolling lever operated by a single link 
connection to the main inlet gear, the lift of the valve 
and consequently the amount of gas admitted and 
the time of admission being regulated by the gov­
ernor. The exhaust gear is of the single beat poppet 
valve type, eccentric operated, and is in this respect a 
duplicate of the main inlet gear. A distinctive feature 
of this gas engine is the location of the exhaust bon­
net with its valve at the bottom of the cylinder, 
where all the dirt is removed by the action of the 
exhaust gases and the provision of a substantial jack 
to lower the entire exhaust mechanism out of place 
to allow inspection and regrinding of the valve, and 
which also serves to swing the valve chamber, with 
the valve and its entire operating mechanism com­
plete, out to one side, where it can be reached by 
the crane hoist. The removal of one pin, either in 
the inlet or exhaust mechanism, is all that is neces­
sary to allow the removal of either the inlet or ex­
haust bonnets, with their valves and entire operating 
mechanism, without disturbing and adjustment what­
ever.
The igniters are electrically controlled and so ar­
ranged that the time of ignition may be regulated by 
a single hand wheel. Direct current at 60 volts is 
used in the ignition system. Duplicate igniters are 
provided at each end of the cylinder to insure prompt 
firing of low heat value gases and also to avoid the 
danger of shut down due to short circuit. The entire 
ignition system, from the motor generator set which 
furnishes the current, to the electrically operated ig­
niters, is the most solidly built apparatus ever fur­
nished for this purpose.
The air starting device consists of a small poppet 
inlet air valve at each end of each cylinder, with a 
main distributing valve operated by the layshaft. Air 
is admitted to each cylinder in turn at what would 
be the explosion stroke. As the high compression 
carried prevents the engine from stopping on the 
dead center, this arrangement insures the prompt 
starting of even a tandem engine without the use of 
a barring gear. The Port Washington engines being 
twin tandem will, of course, start from any position.
The load at the present time is extremely variable, 
swinging from less than one-half to 50 per cent, over­

---------------------------------------------------

THE TARTANii
load, with momentary peaks greatly in excess of this.
It is only by a study of the switchboard instruments, 
however, that this is apparent, as the engine handles 
the maximum overloads as quietly, and with the same 
freedom from vibration, that characterizes its oper­
ation under normal conditions. To the observer 
there is no outward indication of the magnitude of 
the forces at work. The engine turns its centers as 
quietly as a slow running Corliss engine, and is as 
indifferent to the rapid changes in load, impressing 
one with the tremendous reserve power in each unit.
All wearing surfaces, including the main bearings, 
slides, crank and crosshead pins, are arranged for 
a continuous oiling system and the cylinders are lu­
bricated by carefully timed admission of the cylinder 
oil, Richardson’s sight feed oil pumps being used.
The water cooling system includes ample provision 
for cooling the cylinder walls, cylinder heads, pis­
tons, piston rods, exhaust valves and exhaust bon­
nets. Water is circulated by means of two Norris 
and two Deming pumps, each driven by an Allis-Chal- 
mers induction motor.
The gas for the engines is furnished by producers 
operating on the well-known Loomis-Pettibone sys­
tem. The present instaU&tion comprises two gen­
erating units, each consisting of a pair of gas pro­
ducers connected to a common economizer, wet 
scrubber and exhauster. The gas is delivered into 
a holder of 30,000 cubic feet capacity. The normal 
rating of the present plant is 4,000 H. P., and it has 
a capacity of 25 per cent, overload for five hours du­
ration.
The brick building containing the apparatus is di­
vided into a basement 19 feet in depth and a single 
story about 14 feet in height to the eaves. The oper­
ating or charging floor is about 6 feet above the level 
of the ground outside the building. A coal tank 50 
feet long is located on the operating floor, with open­
ings in front of the charging doors of the gas produc­
ers, thus bringing the fuel ¡o points convenient to the 
man operating the gas plant. Hocking Valley bitu­
minous slack coal, containing about 11,500 British 
thermal units per pound, is the fuel ordinarily used.
The plant is operated on the down-draft principle, 
the air being admitted through the charging door at 
the top of each producer, and the necessary suction 
being caused by an exhauster located beyond the wet 
scrubber. By this method the volatile matter and 
distillates are drawn through the deep bed of incan­
descent fuel and gasified, thus avoiding any tar ex­
tracting machinery, and enabling the system to pro­
duce gas obtaining 80 per cent, of the heat units 
possessed by the fuel used. Reverse runs of steam, 
generated by the gas passing through the economizer, 
or waste heat boiler, are occasionally made for the 
purpose of breaking up the fuel bed. The water gas 
made by this process mixes with the producer gas in 
the holder and slightly 'enriches it. The average 
calorific value of the gas as delivered from the holder 
is 125 British thermal units per cubic foot. The gas 
mains leading to the engines are equipped with Lud­
low valves.—National Engineer.
