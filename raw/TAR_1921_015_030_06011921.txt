BAND MEN HOLD 
ANNUAL BANQUET
Great Things Planned For Next 
Year’s—Alumni and Athletic 
Association Promise Support
STUDENT COUNCIL PRESENTED 
AT LAST GEN. ASSEMBLY
The last student assembly of the 
year took place last Wednesday at 
the Music Hall. Announcements by 
President Nichol opened the program. 
Mr. Pearson of the Music School was 
called upon and rendered two selec­
tions on the pipe organ which were 
well recèived. Next President Hamer­
schlag gave a short talk mentioning 
the criticism that lias been circulating 
aijjout the Campus and announcing 
that the financial situation of the 
school has been provided for and that 
a certain amount of the money for 
the new gymnasium is forthcoming. 
He then awarded the 'Student Council 
Insignia. Those receiving the insignia 
were: Eleanor McCarson, Margaret 
Griffin, M. M. D.; C. B. Schmidt, 
Brandin, F. 'S. Bloom, H. G. Nichol, 
Science; John Todd, R. M. Crosby, 
Arts; Harry Hamman, J. R. Rudi&ill, 
P. D. Good, Industries. President 
Nichol then presented the Council for 
next year composed of F. I. Smith, 
President, Helen Reed, Laura Bugher, 
“Al” Irwin, “Red” Godden, C. B. Reid,
E. M. .Sitults. The ¡Science representa­
tives are yet to be elected. F. I. 
Smith, the new President, made a 
few remarks briefly outlining the 
policy for next year. A humorous 
farce put on by Goodrich, Paquin and 
Brandin created several laughs. Carl 
Reid gave a short humorous reading 
adapted from “Romeo and Juliet” 
followed by another of a similar na­
ture. This concluded the program and 
the assembly adjourned.
In keeping with their past work 
and as an indication of what they 
wlil do next year, the Carnegie Tech 
Band gave a big feed for themselves 
and a few of their friends last Tues­
day night at the Seventh Avenue 
Hotel. The annual band banquet 
was the official name of the feed, 
but that was a little too formal. It 
was just get-together, differing from 
their weekly meetings, ini that, some 
one else furnished the music, and 
all that the band men had to do was 
consume every thing that was put 
before them.
“Dick” Arnold, retiring njanager, 
in the caipacity of toastmaster, of­
ficiated, and told a few original ones. 
Dick tried to start the program off 
with “De Molay’a” and “On the 
Square,” but the band was settled 
down with cigars and couldn’t be 
stirred. Dean Tarbell, as cymbal 
player of the Harvard Band, told of 
an interesting experience the Har­
vard Band had with their city rival 
Boston Tech. As a builder of Tech 
spirit, Dean Tarbell said the band 
was unsurpassed. An explanation of 
the new movement of giving the 
plebes preference in the dormitories 
was given.
Promising the support of the Ath­
letic Association In every way possi­
ble, Frank Haaren, graduate manager 
of athletic, also thanked the band 
for their appearance at the athletic 
games and said that the Athletic 
Association needed them very badly, 
because, what would a football game 
be without the band? Mr. Lee told 
about the results of the Bellevue 
concert and ifrom what Mr. Lee said, 
Bellevue is a Carnegie Tech town 
now. Mr. A. N. Heyl urged the band 
to be prepared for the coming foot­
ball season, as we were traveling 
down to W. and J. this year.
jMr. Mawhinney. of the Musical 
Clubs, said that the Musical Clubs 
were ready ’and willing to co-operate 
With the band, he also mentioned 
the custom of the Musical Clubs in 
giving a smoker in the beginning as 
applicable. Jimmie Bateman, repre­
senting the Student Activities Board, 
promising the backing of the board.
“Sully” was next and gave another 
one of his talks. He complimented 
the band on their work and told of 
the first Carnegie Tech Band in 1914 
when there wasn’t a dram, bass or 
alto. Sully was with the band then 
and indications are that Sully will 
be with the band some more.
Dick Arnold was then presented a 
gold pencil by “Sully” as an appre­
ciation of Dick’s work for the band.
Following the speakers, election of 
officers was held and the following 
men were selected: Fred L. Knowles, 
manager; A. C. Corras, business man­
ager; W. H. Smith, secretary and 
treasurer, and F. T. Banner, librar­
ian.

BLANKS FROM REGISTRAR
During the summer of 1921 courses 
will be offered only in the Division 
of Industries and the Division of 
Science and Engineering. All courses, 
except the field work in surveying 
and the short course in coal mining, 
will begin Monday, June 27 and con­
tinue eight weeks, closing August 19.
In the Division of Industries, 
courses have been arranged primar­
ily to meet the needs of Federal 
Board students. The following shops 
will be operated: Sheet Metal,
Plumbing, Electric Wiring, Forge, 
Patternmaking and Automobile. A 
speciial course in Oxyacetylene Weld­
ing will be given. Opportunity is of­
fered (for teachers of manual arts to 
widen their familiarity with shop 
processes and to any others to > take 
intensive shop work preparatory to 
entering various industries.
In addition to the shop work there 
will be courses in Mathematics; 
Physics and Mechanical Drafting.
For the most part, the summer 
courses in the Division of Science 
and engineering are those subjects 
of the Freshmen and Sophomore 
years that are 'common to all the en­
gineering curricula, such as English, 
Mathematics, Mechanics. Physics, 
Chemistry, Economcs, Engineering 
Drawing and Descriptive Geometry. 
In the Junior year the courses in 
Mechanics and in Light will be, giv­

The grand total of the pledges 
made to the recent Athletic Exten­
sion Fund Drive is §40,294.00.
The prize winners for the various 
competitions conducted are as fol­
lows: The individual prizes for the
two girls obtaining the greatest 
number of subscriptions were won 
by Miss Puyllis Pfouts and Miss 
Beatrice Crawshaw with a total of

mail’s prize is Thomas Griggs, wrho 
brought in the largest individual 
subscription from the Jones & 
Lauglilin Company in the amount of 
$1,000.00.
Due to a misunderstanding as 
result of not clearly defining the rules 
of contest, the Loyalty Cup which 
was the prize 'for the fraternity 
turning in the greatest amount of 
subscriptions, has been awarded in 
duplicate to the Woodlawn Club and 
Xi Sigma Upsilon fraternity. These 
two groups obtaining the greatest 
number of subscriptions, under the 
two possible interpretations of the 
rules of contest.
The class obtaining the greatest

CIVIL ENG. SOCIETY
CAP AND GOWN DOPE
Caps and gowns will be issued to 
all day students who have ordered 
them on Friday afternoon at 1:30 
p. m., in the foyer of the Arts build­
ing. It will be necessary for every 
senior to get them at this time as 
they are to be worn at the Bacca­
laureate services on Sunday evening.
Caps and gowns will be taken up 
by the representatives from the var­
ious divisions immediately after the 
Commencement exercises. The com­
mittee asks the sincere co-operation 
of the students in this matter.
The Civil Engineering Society uin- 
troduced an innovation by holding 
their last weekly meeting of the year 
at a luncheon in the Hotel Schenley 
last Thursday, May 26. After lunch 
Professor MscCullough gave the grad­
uating class some good advice, and 
Dr. Rush and Mr. Evans of the C. E. 
faculty also spoke. Election of of­
ficers for next year was held. H. J. 
Ward being chosen president, H. A. 
Shope, first vice president; H: A. 
Baugh, second vice president; J. K. 
Elliott, secretary, N. K. Long, treas­
urer, and S. A. Myers, editor of the 
See Ease.
Everyone present greatly enjoyed 
the affair and unanimously voted to 
make it an annual event.

1921-22.
Over one hundred and fifty couples 
enjoyed the “biggest event” of 
Commencement Week last night at 
the Senior Farewell. The affair was 
held in the Design School foyer and 
lasted until 2 this morning.
The biggest attraction (besides the 
girl) was the music which was fur­
nished by the Joseph Smith’s Victor 
Orchestra. This, celebrated group or 
music makers was secured from 
New York only after a great deal 
of effort by the committee. That the 
effort was decidedly worth while was 
plainly manifested by the success of 
the event.

Speaks, No Insignia Yet
Without a doubt the first annual 
Freshman Frolic was the best affair 
held on the campus during the past 
year. It surpassed even the fondest 
dreams of its enthusiastic supporters.
The day had been hot, and then, 
as if sent by Providence, there came 
a cooling shower which made the at­
mosphere exactly right for dancing 
and the old delicious fruit punch 
kept it so.
Fresh green palms and ferns made 
the Arts foyer seem a new place and 
they furnished an unsurpassable 
background for those dainty new 
frock which made the girls seem 
light as fairies. Later, after the va­
rious colored hats and balloons had 
been given out in the grand march, 
things were • still more brilliant. 
Noise made by the squakers and 
blowouts at one tme almost drowned 
out the nine-piece special orchestra 
which Ed. Hughes and Al Schoef had 
secured for the occasion. Music crit­
ics on the camps say that it beats 
the popular jazz band.
But it would be hard to beat the 
attractive program designed by Vince 
Roy which was about the cleverest 
program seen at a dance this season. 
The Student Council had been in-

COMMISSION MARES REPORT 
TO CARNEGIE C0P0RATI0N
The report of the commission sent 
here to investigate conditions regard­
ing the Institute was presented to 
the Carnegie Corporation in New 
York and from present indications 
satisfactory appropriations will be 
forthcoming.
Nothing definite has been made 
public except that a new gym has 
been promised and the exact amount 
to be appropriated will not be fixed 
until it is decided upon at a meet­
ing of the Corporation in New York 
on June 6. At that time the board 
here will be Informed as to the 
amount of the appropriation and not 
until that body votes to accept or 
reject the proposition will it be 
made public.
TWO SHORT PLAYS GIVEN BY 
DRAMA DEPT. LAST FRIDAY
The two miniature plays which 
constituted last Friday’s matinee 
were like cold fizzy drinks on a 
humid faternoon. Alike fantastical, 
they were acted with great spirit and 
no little charm by members of the 
Plebe class of the School of Drama. 
Love, the Locksmith, presented for 
the first time, is the work of Mr. 
Kennedy of the English Department. 
It is a brief and rather Incoherent 
treatment of the aphorism that Love 
will find a way. Its virtues are its 
lightness of touch and the deftness 
and wit of its lines. Miss Church 
and Mr. Kappes acted the lovers with 
charm and taste. Mr. Linton and 
Mr. Lazarus were the hostile can­
tankerous fathers, and Miss Power 
and Miss Benson the scolding wives.
(Continued on Page Two.)
“If the members or the Musical 
Clubs will give us their full support 
next year there is no question but 
what they will have the must suc­
cessful season In the history of the
Club,” declared J. W. Batman in his
address, at the Musical Clubs smoker 
held in Science Club Rooms last Fri­
day evening. Mr. Batman gave the 
assembled members of the clubs a 
report on the action of the Student 
Activities Board In regards to the 
budget ‘for next year. He reported 
that the appropriation had been in­
creased to $900; that the recommen­
dation, asking for a script, letter
award to members for four years'
work on the Musical Clubs and Band 
had been disapproved, and that it 
was also impossible to grant the re­
quest for a graduate manager, of non- 
athletic activities at this time. Mr. 
Batman complimented the clubs on 
the good work done In the past sea­
son andi on the spirit shown in co­
operating with the other organiza­
tions at our school. He spoke of the 
plans being made by members of 
different alumni clans for joint con­
certs by all the musical organizations 
at Tech—concerts similar fo the one 
given In the Chamber of Commerce 
rooms this past season. These plans 
also include, according to Mr. Bat­
man, a soven-day trip for the Mu­
sical Clubs at the Easter recess and 
several extendod trips for the band. 
While all these plans may not ma, 
terallze, the prospect, for their ful­
fillment aro vory bright; according to 
rhe speaker, and the loyal support 
and co-operation of the clubs will 
make them a certainty. In closing 
Mr. Batman expressed it< as his opin­
ion, as well as that of many other 
prominent alumni, that Tech could 
be advertised through the Musical 
Clubs better than in any other way, 
and exhorted the members to work 
hard next year In order to make 
their organization a worthy represen­
tative of the school.
President Mawhinney Introduced 
the most important -.¡business' of the 
evening when lie read the recommen­
dations of the executive committee 
for next year’s officers. Several ad­
ditions were made to the list of 
names he submitted. The officers 
elected were: C. A. Carney, presi­
dent; G. L. Jordy, manager; L. R, 
Turcotte, assistant manager; S. E. 
Korach, publicity manager; P. C. 
Gannon, stage manager; R. R. Saw- 
hill,1 librarian Glee Club, and D. D, 
Foster, librarian Mandolin Club.

were provided by the committee and

Bloom reported that nothing definite 
had been decided as to who would 
be graduate manager of student activ­
ities for the coming year but an- 
nouncment would be made as soon

porary treasurer of the Student Ac­
tivities Board and will begin his 
duties June 1st.
A motion pertaining to the sending 
of all school publications to Mrs. An­
drew Carnegie was passed. During 
his life/Andrew Carnegie received the 
various school publications and it wasi 
felt now that Mrs. 'Camegle should 
be kept in touch »with the student 
activities in that way.
The Board advises that members 
of organizations receiving insignia 
will be taken care of during^the sum-
tention of resumng his practice as a 
portrait painter in New York and

It is now. Professor Hubbell came 
to Tech in the fall of 1918.
He is a native of Paola, Kansas, 
and received his first Instruction In 
painting at the Chicago Art Institute. 
Later ho spent twelve years work­

THE SENIORS
Within the week another group of Carnegie men and women 
will put aside their books and leave their .Alma Mater. This year’s 
class, which numbers nearly 400, is the largest ever graduated by 
this institution since the first group left in ’08.
As these Seniors leave the .campus their absence will be noticed 
for a time from the many and varied activities which have flourished 
during their sojourn here; but only for a short, time—another 
group moves up to take their place, and the traditions of Carnegie 
¦will be left in care of loyal and willing hearts, and strong and 
able hands.
When Commencement Day is over and each Senior makes for 
his goal, the world may not suddenly be reformed but as the years 
roll by some of these Carnegie folks will leave a lasting tribute 
to themselves and bring honor and glory to their Alma Mater.
AN ASSOCIATE EDITORSHIP
There has long been a feeling that the interests of the M. M D. 
and Design School girls as regards publicity and news matters 
could be bettered. In view of that fact the Editors announce the 
creation of a new position on the staff, that of Associate Editor. 
Hitherto the M. M. D. girls have always elected some member of 
their Junior Class as their representative; she held office for one 
year and that ended it. Under the proposed plan any girl in 
M. M. D. or Design can come out for the staff and compete for 
that position.
This year, following the splendid work done by Miss Helen 
Lewis as M. M. D. representative, the Editors announce her as the 
incumbent of that position for 1922.

TRI-ST1ATE CHAMPIONSHIP 
WON BY CARNEGIE
TECH TRACK MEN
(Continued (From Pago One.) 
Biller and West ran breast and 
breast, and it was only at the finish 
that West went in the lead, where 
he finished wltli ouly half-a-yard to 
spare.
Mention should foe made of the of­
ficials, and of the manner in which 
the! events were run off. Every 
event was run-off according to sched­
ule so well, that there were fewr mo­
ments in which the spectator had to 
wait for the next eVent. The court- 
,esy of the. scorers was at all tim.es 
most evident, as shown by the eager 
willingness to aid the Carnegie 
Tech radio men. The announcing of 
the winners in the various events 
was at all times clear and. to the 
point, never at any time leaving any 
doubt in the minds of the spectators 
as to who the various winners were, 
and their time.
The Universty of Pittsburgh was 
minus two of ts stars, Shea and 
Hayes, ’v&hich was a regrettable fact 
in that Teoli wras not permitted to 
defeat the best, that Pitt had, but 
the margin by. which Tech won was 
so great, as to make it very improb­
able 'for pitt, to ha^ro won even if 
these two men had b6en present. 
Tech, without, a doubt, had by far 
the best balanced team, and for that 
reason fully deserved to win. Her 
©print men, hor distance men, and 
her field men wore all of about the 
same oallber, and: this caliber was 
in most casgs superior to the best 
the other teams had to offer. Prac­
tically the only place in which Tech 
fell down was in the field events. 
Here Pitt! seemed io have been the 
strongest, with the exception of the 
pole vault and the running high and 
broad jumps,’ in which events,' Tech 
took all first places, a second and a
third. In practically evory event, 
Tech placed men.
The individual stars for Tech 
would be hard to pick, and at the 
same time, give . due .justice to the 
whole team, in individual points 
scored, perhaps 'it would be best to 
give the total points scored toy each 
man. Lockwood scored the highest 
number of points with 14. Kelly and 
Miller each scored 10 points. Tall- 
man came third with S points. The 
others scored as follows: Smith 6, 
Pittman 5, Stults 5, Blesch 4, Dyke- 
man 4, Schillinger 4, Greenlaw 4, 
Hiller 4, Arnold 3, Leet 3 and 
Schwab, Hiller, Donahue and Brum­
baugh of the one-mile relay team, 
aided in turning in three points. In 
the running high jump, Smith and 
Lockwood tied for first place hon­
ors, thereby causing nine points to 
be divided between them, to be de­
cided by a. toss of a coin as to 
which one gets the five points for 
first place.
Below are the summaries:

dent that the event is a much need­
ed one and will rank with the other 
big affairs of Tech—the 'Soph boys, 
Junior Prom., Senior ball—all, in fact, 
ir seemed much like the Mardi Gras.
The patrons and patronesses 
were: Dean L. W. Scales, Mr. and
Mrs. Dosey, Miss Winchester, Dr. 
Gott, Mr. Wallace and Mr. Abler.
To the committee which worked 
so hard to make this annual affair 
an occasion never to be forgotten, 
too much credit cannot be given and 
they are to be complimented upon 
the successful manner n which it 
was carried out. Vincent Roy, Arts 
president, acted as general chairman 
and he was ahly assisted by Mar­
jorie Cook, M. M., Thomas Griggs, 
Science, Cy Comfort, Industries, and 
now it’s history.
SUMMER SCHOOL
TWO FANTASIES—A PLEBE 
MATINEE
(Continued From) Page One.)
Mr. Eisenstat, as Cupid, the master 
of ceremonies, acted with; ease and 
assurance. The fantastic setting w'as 
designed by Mr. Mudgett, and the 
values of the piece were felt and 
rendered in Professor Wallace’s- pro­
duction.
The second and more ambitious 
number was the Goodman-Heclit Har­
lequinade, The Wonder Hat. It is 
an ingenious agair, the style is some- 
timees too subtle for vocal transmis­
sion. The pictures, however, were 
pleasingly composed, and the’w’ords 
were intelligently delivered. The ec­
centric comedy of the trafficer in 
magical wares was11 well played by 
Mr. Lazarus. Mr. McCarthy wTas a 
graceful and sophisticated Harlequin 
to the comedy and spirituelle Colum­
bine of Miss Cohen. For contrast 
there wras the vivacity and common 
sense of Miss Nothdurft’s Margot, 
and the traditionally pathetic Pierrot 
was touched by cool reasonableness 
ip Mr. Miulgett’s acting. Professor 
Stevens directed the performance. 
The results of the year’s work are 
apparent! In the improved diction and 
the increased assurance of the per­
formers.

freely of the aforesaid refreshments 
and consequently suffer from indi­
gestion, a. two-reel side-splitting 
movie was included inthe entertain­
ment in order that the digestion of 
any such members might be aided by 
a few hearty laughs. Each member 
was presented writh a leather cigar­
ette case as a souvenir. Presenta­
tion of insignia, which w^as intended 
to conclude the business of the even­

them as soon as had been expected. 
This feature of ,the evening being 
thus prevented, the members snapped 
stories for a few minutes and then 
disbanded to get their vocal chords

The Senior picnic will be held 
Thursday afternoon. All Seniors are

On The Plaid Screen
BY H. L. MOERSFELDER
CARNEGIE TENNIS CHAMPIONS
The Carnegie tennis team may rightfully claim the championship of 
Western Pennsylvania, having defeated the leading teams of this district 
by overwhelming scores. Grove City, West Virginia, Bethany, Washington 
and Jefferson and Allegheny have all fallen before the super play of the 
Plaid net men, the wearers of the Plaid having defeated them by large 
scores. Last year Tech was victorious on the courts and claimed the 
championship, and this year the successes have been greater than those of 
last year, so once again the Skibo team deserves to be elevated to the 
enviable place occupied by them in the past, of being the best; second to 
none. The tennis team is to be congratulated, Carnegie is indeed most for­
tunate in having for its representatives, players of such great ability. 
Thanks are due Colonel Brooks, who has so ably, and untiringly assisted the 
development of the team. His efforts have proven fruitful and a large 
measure of the successes enjoyed this and last year are due to his con­
scientious endeavors to place and keep Carnegie in her present status, in 
tennis.
SOMETHING YOU CAN DO
With the approach of summer, and the school year drawing to a close, 
there must be some thought given to the athletic situation for the coming 
year. Football is, of course, of primary interest and importance. Although 
Tech had, last season, the best team and most successful year, there is 
still much to be done in perfecting a better organization than was had in 
1920.
It would be of great benefit to the school, teams, etc., to interest many 
athletes in high schools, who are to graduate this June, in Tech, and have 
them as students here next fall. This is rather a new policy, for Carnegie 
Tech, but has been in vogue in other colleges for quite some time. In 
your own home town, you must know one or two likely athletes who are
graduating this June, who have no particular college in view, so why not
try to interest them in Tech, surely they could attend no school which could 
give them any better training, in whatever course they intend to pursue.
If each student would try, there would be no lack of athletic material
in the' future as there has been in the past.

SPORTSMANSHIP
At the Washington and Jefferson-Tech baseball game played on the Tech 
field a short time ago, there was some controversy over the rules, on the part 
of the W. & J. supporters, which caused a few Tech rooters to jeer them. 
There were only a few who did so, much to the credit of the student body. 
This spirit is bound to prevail unless carefully watched, and all should 
guard against criticizing the opponents, for while none of the comments 
were meant seriously, they undoubtedly made an impression on the visitors 
and others who were at the game, which would be hard to erase. Pull for 
Carnegie, but do it as it always has been done at Tech, in a sportsmanlike 
manner.

FROM THE BACKGROUND
Athletes at Tech have been more or less confined to the men’s schools 
and .very little has been heard of the girls. Last winter there was a girls’ 
Varsity basket ball team representing the school. Now there is a volley 
ball team. At all schools where there are coreds the girls have teams as 
well as the men. These teams are recognized and well attended games 
played. The Tech co-ed will eventually come into her own, and is doing so 
by continual efforts to represent Carnegie in an athletic way, and playing 
the teams of other schools. It is.hoped that next year the co-ed basket ball 
team and other teams formed by them will have extensive schedules and 
develop into a part of the regular athletic program at Tech.
OUR TRACK SQUAD
Tech is completing, not only her most successful year ifi tennis, but in 
track as well. The track team has steadily improved, even surpassing last 
year’s squad, and the outcome of the meets held, in which the Tartan wear­
ers have participated, have resulted in victories for Tech in most cases.
At the Penn relays, held in Philadelphia, the Tartan relay team finished 
third in their event, an excellent record, in that national meet. The Alle­
gheny dual meet was rather a one-sided affair, Tech having things much 
their own way. The formidable West Virginia squad proved no match for 
the fast Plaid-team, both track and field events being taken pretty generally 
by Scotchmen.
At Washington, In competition with; the leading colleges in the vicinity 
Tech placed first, clinching her hold to the claim of championship oi^Western 
Pennsylvania, in track.Coach Iddings has developed a team, which may rightfully claim the 
championship of the western section of the state._____________________________

DEDICATED TO PRESIDENT 
HAMERSCHLAG
Dr. John A. Stevenson, vice presi­
dent of the Equitable and formerly 
director-of School of Life Insurance 
Salesmanship, has dedicated his book 
“Meeting Objections,” to President 
Hamerschlag. The book is made up 
of suggestions to salesman for meet­
ing objections raised by prospective 
customers. It was edited by Dr. 
Stevenson and Professor Lovelace, 
and published by Harper’s for Har­
per’s Life Insurance Library. The 
dedication reads:
“This book is dedicated to Presi­
dent A. A. Hamerschlag of the Car­

FOOTBALL CAMP SITE 
STILL UNDECIDED
Mgr. Haaren to Locate Training 
Camp at Glencairn
The site for the football training 
camp is still under discussion, but in 
all probability the camip will he held, 
at Camp Louise Carnegie.
This place is a most ideal one for 
such a purpose, it being located at 
Glencairn, Pa., just across the Alle­
gheny river from Freeport. It is a 
tract of about 750 acres, 500 of which 
are under cultivation. A large, old 
fashioned mansion, which will accom­
modate 50 men comfortably, is located 
on the grounds. Freeport is easily 
accessible, the boys usually going 
there to spend the evenings.
Last year the camp was held Sep 
tember 13 to 27, which was the open­
ing of school. Notice will be given, 
^vhen it is definitely decided where 
the camp is to be located. All in­
quiries to be addressed to Graduate 
Manager Haaren, Carnegie Tech.
TECH RESERVES BEAT PITTS­
BURGH ACADEMY
On Thursday afternoon, May 26, 
the . reserves. played an easy game 
with the Pittsburgh Academy.
The Academy boys were rather out­
classed by the classy playing of our 
reserve team under Capt Shorty Maur­
er, and both our twirlers, Peterson 
and Mitchell pitched good ball, as 
was evidenced by the number of 
strike-outs.
No extraordinary hitting waa 
shown, but the whole team was steady 
at the bat.

Championship For Carnegie Netmen
Skibo Racquet Wielders Take 
Over Allegheny by Score of 
6-0—Allegheny Beat Pitf 4- 
2. Harkness Coming Back— 
Teams Show Good Form
PENN STATE NEXT OPPONENT
The Carnegie Tech tennis team, 
displaying far better form than at 
any previous time this season, de­
feated the team from Allegheny Col­
lege with compartive ease, losing 
only one set throughout the entire 
six watches, 3jid winning the tourna­
ment by the score of 6-0. This tour­
nament, with its decisive victory 
gave to Tech without a doubt the 
sectional championship of Western 
Pennsylvania and of the Allegheny 
Mountain Association. This victory 
1b especially pleasing to the follow­
ers of Tech because Allegheny Col­
lege scored a 4-2 victory over Pitt, 
and has throughout the season played 
.a might}' good brand of tennis.
A very pleasing event of the after­
noon was the signs Captain Hark­
ness showed of coming back into his 
normal good form. Although he lost 
a set, this can be blamed more on 
the good playing of Clarke, than on 
any miscues of his own. With the 
exception of the second set, ho had 
the upper hand' throughout, display­
ing good judgment in placement 
shots, and generally played a good 
all around game.
Neville and Keil played their usu­
ally good game, giving their oppo­
nents scarcely a look-in. These two 
men are going great;, and are de­
stined to rank high in collegiate ten­
nis circles.
Schwarftz again, proved Ills worth 
to the team by his sound play, and 
at times spectacular. His overhead 
game was again the most noticeable 
part. of his good play.
Now that the sectional champion­
ship is safely tucked away the team 
is going out to conquer. They meet 
Penn State the latter part of tills 
week, and will more than likely 
“¡bring home the bacon” with a lit­
tle to spare.,
The scores of the matches were 
as follows:
WEST VIRGINIA-TECH

Mountaineers to PresentStrong 
Line Up
Saturday of this week, the Tech nine 
will face the strong mountaineer ag­
gregation of West Virginia.
The “hill climbers” have many 
scalps on their belts two of these, be­
ing Bethany and the Navy. The boys 
from Morgantown hope to add anoth­
er nick to the string already cut in 
their bat, in their game with Teen.
The Slcibo sluggers will find a hard 
nut to crack when they try to hit the 
West Virginia pitcher, as he lias few 
hits recorded ’ against him. Whoover 
will twirl for Tech will be up against 
a crowd of heavy hitters; every game 
played by the mountaineers lias had 
several two and three base hits. It 
promises to be one of the fastest 
games of the season.
My parents taught me not to smoke; 
I don’t.
Or listen to a naughty jpke;

To dance and vamp is very wrong,

What Is Research?
S
UPPOSE that a stove burns too much coal for the amount of 
heat that it radiates. The manufacturer hires a man familiar 
with the principles of combustion and heat radiation to make 
experiments which will indicate desirable changes in design. The stove 
selected as the most efficient is the result of research.
Suppose that you want to make a ruby in a factory—not a mere 
imitation, but a real ruby, indistinguishable by any chemical or 
physical test from the natural stone. You begin by analyzing rubies 
chemically and physically. Then you try to make rubies just as 
nature did, with the same chemicals and under similar conditions. 
Your rubies are ,the result of research—research of a different type 
from that required to improve the stove.
Suppose, as you melted up your chemicals to produce rubies and 
experimented with high temperatures, you began to wonder how hot 
the earth must have been millions of years ago when rubies were first 
crystallized, and what were the forces at play that made this planet 
what it is. You begin an investigation that leads you far from rubies 
and causes you to formulate theories to explain how the earth, and, 
for that matter, how the whole solar system was created. That would 
be research of a still different type—pioneering into the unknown to 
satisfy an insatiable curiosity.
Research of all three types is conducted in the Laboratories of the 
General Electric Company. But it is the third type of research— 
pioneering into the unknown—that means most, in the long run, even 
though it is undertaken with no practical benefit in view.
At the present time, for example, the Research Laboratories of the 
General Electric Company are exploring matter with X-rays in order 
to discover not only how the atoms in different substances are 
’ arranged but how the atoms themselves are built up. The more you 
know about a substance, the more you can do with it. Some day this 
X-ray work will enable scientists to answer more definitely than they 
can now the question: Why is iron magnetic? And then the elec­
trical industry will take a great step forward, and more real progress 
will be made in five years than can be made in a century of experi­
menting with existing electrical apparatus.
You can add wings and stories to an old house. But to build a 
new house, you must begin with the foundation.

GREETINGS TO THE 1921 
GRADUATESBOSTON CLANThe Dependable Man.
A few days a,go an assignment was 
made to a reporter who promised to 
have the article In on time. The 
place in the “make up” of . the page 
was reserved for It. The time came. 
The article did not. A weak article 
had i,o appear emphasized on the first 
page. • All depended on the reporter. 
He failed.
Napoleon's chance of success at 
Waterloo was utterly destroyed by 
the Incompetence of the two marshals 
whom in an evil hour be selected for 
high commands. The feeble and 
false maneuvers of Grouchy, the im- 
petousity of Ney were no small fac­
tors In the defeat. The emperor de­
pended on them. They failed.

The Boston Clan will hold an elec­
tion of officers and social gathering 
at the home of Mr. James H. Samp­
son, '08, 22 Bates Road, Watertown, 
Mass., Saturday evening, June 4th. 
at S p. m. We urge your attendance 
at this meeting and if married bring 
your Better Half.
If coming from Boston take the 
Cambridge subway to Harvard 
¦Square, change to a "Watertown car 
and ask the conductor to put you off 
at Bates Road. Some members may 
find it more convenient to take a 
Watertown-Newton car to the Water­
town car 'barn, change to a Harvard 
Square car and get off at Bates Road.
You are urged to notify me at once 
if you will be able to attend this 
meeting. If any greater Boston mem­
bers will he able to entertain out, of 
town members they are requested to 
report to me at once in order that I 
may extend hospitality to some out 
of town member.
Expect a good time, for you’ll surely 
get it.
To eveiy Tech man and woman 
graduating, the Alumni extend to you 
their greetings and welcomes you into 
its organization. As your thoughts 
turn toward Commencement, it natur­
ally turns towards the organization 
that still makes you a college boy and 
girl.
The 1921 class is undoubtedly prov­
ing the strongest individual class join­
ing the Alumni Association that has 
ever graduated from Tech. It means 
that you are going to prove a great 
asset to the school and are annexing 
to the Alumni Association a strong 
Unit which goes toward the making 
of a bigger and better Tech.
As a safeguard when you have left 
school do not become a dead one, as 
a great many of our past graduates 
and former students have, hut be the 
most active and try to build it up 
rather than tear down.
In filling out your personal history 
blanks, do not fail to fill out the slip 
attached as it signifies your intention 
of becoming a member of the Alumni 
Association. It is a duty to yourself 
and your Alma Mater.
Let the 1921 Class be the first 100 
per cent.

After knowing what the Industries 
Alumni Association has done during 
the past y&ar you cannot afford to re­
main out of the organization.
1st. It is generally known that be­
fore the year 1920-21 the Association 
was dormant to the extent that it did 
not cater to the Division as a whole, 
but instead worked in groups and 
cliques.
2nd. Under the present organiza­
tion it has overcome the above diffi­
culty and is now a true unit of Tech 
and working together for its welfare.
3rd. It has been given more pub­
licity during the past year than all 
other years combined.
4th. Two general meetings have 
been held during the year, one busi­
ness and the other, a Smoker. Be­
sides much business lias been trans­
acted in the meetings of the Board 
which is held once a month.
5th. The 1921 graduating class 
were the guests of honor of the 
Association at the second annual 
Alumni Federation . banquet during 
Campus Week. This will be carried 
on from year to year.
6th. Beginning with the year 1920- 
21 there were 63 members of the 
Association; at the close of the year 
there are over 350 members—an in­
crease in one year of approximately 
600 per cent.
With such true facts as this you 
cannot remain silent. You cannot ex­
pect returns and benefits from a 
school which you dare not support. It 
is something that is a blot on ‘ your 
life. Get in the game and mix with 
real Tech men. Be a booster for your 
school and if you cannot be that, then 
remain silent knockers—remain at the 
bottom—boosters at the , top. To 
which class do you belong?
