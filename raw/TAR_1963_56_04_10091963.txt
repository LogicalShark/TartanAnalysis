Sale of Mums 
Starts Monday
Mum’s the word! In the case 
of the uninitiated, this means that 
the vociferous is not the only 
way to celebrate Homecoming. 
You can also buy a mum, (com­
monly known as a chrysanthe­
mum).
gl The mums, traditionally worn 
during Fall Festival, and es­
pecially at the football game, are 
bright gold, are as fuzzy as an 
English sheepdog, and are al­
most as big. This year, they sport 
a plaid ribbon.
They will be sold every day 
on the cut for $1.00, starting 
Monday, October 14, until just 
before Fall Festival. Purchasers 
can pick them up Saturday (Oc­
tober 26, between 10 a.m. and 
^ p.m. in Morewood lobby.
The revenue from the sale will 
go to the Cwens Scholarship 
Fund.
(Note to freshmen: Since 
Cwens are sponsoring the pro­
ject, they will, of course, be sell­
ing the mums. You may be happy 
to know that you’ll be able to tell 
them apart this time, as they will 
not be wearing their uniforms).,

Remember — All seniors and 
fraternity and sorority members 
must have their picture taken 
during the above times !
Great Debate 
On Oct. 15
Students for Liberal Thought 
and Action and the Society for 
Conservative Studies will jointly 
present a debate between Frank 
Wilkinson and Fulson Lewis III 
on Oct. 15 at 6:30 in Skibo Ball­
room.
Frank Wilkinson is chairman of 
the National Committee to abolish 
HUAC. Sentenced to one year im­
prisonment for contempt of Con­
gress, he stated that, “I am sure 
the court understands that I do 
not really have contempt for the 
Congress of the United States. I 
firmly believe that Congress is 
wrong in creating a committee to 
investigate so-called un-American 
activities in a field In which Con­
gress cannot legislate without vio­
lating the First Amendment.”
Fulton Lewis III was formerly 
on the staff of the House Commit­
tee on Un-American Activities.

Fist Issue of Technical 
Soon Ready For Distribution
^ The first issue of this year’s TECHNICAL is now at press 
and will soon be ready for distribution — not only on Tech’s 
campus but around the world, from the University of Moscow 
to the Library of Congress.
A magazine edited and written by Tech undergraduates,
it has in the past drawn its ma-^ 
terial from such sources as term 
papers, seminars, essays, and 
summer job evaluations. It will 
^continue the same policy this 
year, while concentrating on a 
wider diversity of subject matter.
Undergraduates of all depart­
ments have been encouraged to 
submit writings of a technical or 
general .nature. The editors have 
listed several criteria for a good 
TECHNICAL paper:
1. The importance of accurate 
writing cannot be stressed enough. 
Since the magazine represents one
m of the best undergraduate schools 
in the country, it is necessary to 
keep this requirement in mind 
constantly.
2. Presentation of the material 
must be such that the reader is 
led to the correct conclusions 
about the topic discussed in the 
paper. Material should, in general, 
be of a level not higher than two 
years of undergraduate prepara­
tion.
A 3. The text of a manuscript can 
be from 50 to 4000 words.
4. Photographs, drawings, labels, 
and graphs are desirable when 
they clarify .the text. But it is not 
necessary to prepare the drawings 
which will appear in the maga­
zine; a readable sketch with prop­
er dimensions and captions will 
be sufficient, as staff draftsmen 
prepare final illustrations.
5. The title of the paper should 
®be short and descriptive. Careful
thought should precede its selec­
tion.
Students interested in submitt­
ing manuscripts should contact 
any of the following staff mem­
bers: engineering and science de­
partments, Joe Knownack (692- 
8768) and Henry Werronen (692-
8768); Margaret Morrison College, 
Marney Gilboy (682-8875); fine 
arts, Keith Pierce (692-8356), and 
industrial management and math­
ematics, Dick Morrison (691- 
7930).

to have your picture taken early 
in case a resitting might be nec­
essary during the last week.
If you are interested in a par­
ticular time or date which you 
cannot find posted, go directly to 
Skibo Room 46 to sign up. In some 
cases it might also be possible to

This year’s freshman nominees for Fall Festival Queen 
are going to give the judges a hard time. They are all beauti­
ful, bright, in search for a career and would not mind getting 
married along the way. Their other interests are too varied 
to make any more generalizations, but the following data
*----------------------------------------------------------
English Group 
Reads Shaw
George Bernard Shaw’s “Don 
Juan in Hell” a scene from the 
play “Man and Superman,” will 
be read by students of the drama 
department for an informal dis­
cussion in literature, sponsored 
by English majors. The reading 
will take place Monday, October 
21, at 7:30 in the Wherrett Lounge 
of Skibo for the first English dis­
cussion meeting of the year.
These discussions have be­
come a tradition of the English 
department over the past few 
years and are held, not only for 
English majors, but all students 
on campus who are interested 
in having a cup of coffee and 
talking about the chosen topic of 
the month. It is hoped that a 
mixture of faculty members and 
students from various depart­
ments will continue to lend their 
ideas to the discussions.
The series has been planned by 
a committee of English students, 
three elected from each class. 
Adina Rosenfeld heads the com­
mittee. It has selected topics 
which should be of general in­
terest to the student body, and 
much of the literature discussed 
is read in English composition 
and world literature courses.
In November the topic is 
Thomas Mann’s “Death in Ven­
ice,” and the December meeting 
will be centered around the poe­
try of Gerard Manly Hopkins. 
Students who have not read these 
selections or “Man and Super­
man” and wish to purchase copies 
will find a supply in the Tech 
bookstore.

Tech Gives Attention To 
New Pa. Liquor Laws
Carnegie Tech has received from the Pennsylvania 
Liquor Control Board further proof that the state “means 
business” concerning recent amendments to laws on alcoholic 
consumption by minors. In a letter to President Warner, the 
Superintendent of Public Instruc-^ 
tion re-stated the preface to Act 
465, which was signed into law 
less than two months ago, and
BULLETIN BOARD
urged school officials to expect 
“tragic consequences” to all of­
fenders of the new bill.
Although the policy of the state 
is visibly apparent, there has been 
no official statement from the 
school. However, this is expected 
before the end of the month, and 
when official statements are is­
sued, they are certain to clear up 
many guesses as to how the school 
will react and adhere to the laws.
The essence of the communica­
tion from the PLCB is as follows: 
September 19, 1963 
Dear Dr. Warner:
Governor Scranton signed 
Act 465 of 1963 into law on 
August 14, 1963.
As a preventive measure, we 
believe that information con­
cerning this new law should be 
brought to the attention of the 
students in your school.
It will be apparent to you 
that this amendment makes a 
radical change in the Penal 
Law as it relates to the use of 
alcoholic beverages by minors, 
strengthening it to the point 
where practically any transac­
tion in alcoholic beverages is 
forbidden to a minor and can 
lead to tragic consequences for 
him.
It is a certainty that viola­
tions will be prosecuted dili­
gently and we believe it to be 
our duty to see that our under­
age students realize the dire 
consequences which will fol­
low a violation of the new law.

Today, foregoing levity, let us turn our keen young minds to 
the principal problem facing American colleges today: the 
population explosion. Only last week four people exploded in 
Cleveland, Ohio—one of them while carrying a plate of soup. 
In case you’re thinking such a thing couldn’t happen anywhere 
but in Cleveland, let me tell you about two other cases last 
week—a 45-year-old man in Provo, Utah, and a 19-year-old 
girl in Northfield, Minnesota. And, in addition, there was a 
near miss in High Point, North Carolina—an eight-year-old 
boy who was saved only by the quick thinking of his cat, Fred,who 
pushed the phone off the hook with his muzzle and dialed the 
department of weights and measures. (It would, perhaps, have 
been more logical for Fred to dial the fire department, but one 
can hardly expect a cat to summon a fire engine which is fol­
lowed by a Dalmatian, can one?)
But I digress. The population explosion, I say, is upon us. 
It is, of course, cause for concern but not for alarm, because I 
feel sure that science will ultimately find an answer. After all,

has not science in recent years brought us such marvels as the 
maser, the bevatron, and the Marlboro filter? Oh, what a saga 
of science was the discovery of the Marlboro filter! Oh, what a 
heart-rending epic of trial and error, of dedication and perse­
verance! And, in the end, what a triumph it was when the 
Marlboro research team, after years of testing and discarding 
one filter material after another—iron, nickel, tin, antimony, 
obsidian, poundcake—finally emerged, tired but happy, from 
their laboratory, carrying in their hands the perfect filter 
cigarette! Indeed, what rejoicing there still is whenever we 
light up a Marlboro which comes to us in soft pack and Flip- 
Top Box in all fifty states and Cleveland!
Yes, science will ultimately solve the problems arising from 
the population explosion, but meanwhile America’s colleges 
are in dire straits. Where can we find classrooms and teachers 
for today’s gigantic influx of students?
Well sir, some say the solution is to adopt the trimester sys­
tem. This system, already in use at many colleges, eliminates 
summer vacations, has three semesters per annum instead of 
two, and compresses a four-year-course into three years.
This is, of course, good, but is it good enough? Even under 
the trimester system the student has occasional days off. More­
over, his nights are utterly wasted in sleeping. Is this the kind 
of all-out attack that is indicated?
I say no. I say desperate situations call for desperate reme­
dies. I say that partial measures will not solve this crisis. I 
say we must do no less than go to school every single day of 
the year. But that is not all. I say we must go to school 94 
hours of every day!
The benefits of such a program are, as you can see, obvious. 
First of all, the classroom shortage will disappear because all 
the dormitories can be converted into classrooms. Second, the 
teacher shortage will disappear because all the night watchmen 
can be put to work teaching solid state physics and Restoration 
drama. And finally, overcrowding will disappear because every-MENNEN SPRAY DEODORANT. Best deodorant a man can use. For

Comments and Annotations
First, we would like to thank Mr. Helm of 
the Campus Food Service for being a good 
sport in letting us have some humor with 
him in this column last week. We realize 
that he is working hard to improve the food 
service on campus. However, he should be 
advised that there is one sure indicator of 
his future progress: Skibo coffee — a bever­
age that leaves much room for improvement.
flight to tell the caller that the person is not 
in, only to receive the reply, “Could you take
a message?”
Campus policemen have adamantly kept 
students from walking on the lawns. How­
ever, it frequently is necessary to walk on 
the grass to avoid the sprinklers which con­
tinually water the sidewalks.
We note that the Operations Department 
in an endeavor to become efficient has pur­
chased an automatic window washer — a 20 
ft. pole with a built in hose — that resembles 
one of Tom Swift’s inventions. However, 
when they first tried to clean windows, it 
took five men to handle it. At least it was 
surprising to see clean windows for a change, 
we were beginning to think the sky was cop- 
per-colored.
Hammering, sawing, and grinding accom­
panies the daily investigations of students at 
the Hunt Library, as craftsmen hurry to 
complete the new fourth floor. And when the 
students return to their dorms for a night’s 
rest, workmen are arriving to begin excava­
tion of a gas main in front of Donner Hall.
The school must have finally realized that 
almost any key, bobbie pin, or pen knife 
would work the elevators in Scaife Hall. This 
year the locks on the elevators are no longer 
on.
It is the third week of school and already 
the classrooms in AH are dusty and dirty — 
not too surprising for Pittsburgh. But with 
only a day for Thanksgiving vacation, it may 
be until Christmas before they are thorough­
ly cleaned.
With $43,000 being spent on improvements 
for the men’s dormitories, we hope that some­
one will remember to install another phone 
in Scobell Hall. One can only pity the poor 
soul who runs up a flight of stairs, answers 
the phone, and then runs up and down a

Carnegie Tech owes its foot­
ball team a vote of respect and 
appreciation for its fighting 
spirit in the Waynesburg game!
Loyal Fans
When you walk into a warm AH class­
room, you must keeep the door open to insure 
adequate ventilation, only to listen to the 
janitors continually roll the noisy dollys, 
wheelbarrows, and mop buckets by, or hear 
the talking maids and students as they walk 
by. However, we realize that the students 
cannot be blamed for having to talk loud in 
the halls: they must do so to be heard over 
the racket of the janitors.
Rumor has it from a member of Execu­
tive Council of Student Government, that 
Student Congress has purchased a new elec­
tric ditto machine; and will probably appro­
priate the money to purchase it at the next 
meeting.
Many students have been complaining 
that the old chairs in the physics lecture hall, 
EH 2315, are hard and uncomfortable. They 
say they always wake up with a backache.

Axelrad Draws 
Comment
Editor, the Tartan:
Mr. Axelrad’s unusually in­
formative and interesting col­
umn last week shows that there 
still exists an element of mo­
rality at Carnegie Tech. This is 
shown by the straw vote de­
feat of his “proposal” to flunk 
students whose friends informed 
(or more aptly, ratted) on them 
for stealing books. I am by no 
means condoning theft for any 
reason, but I am also violently 
opposed to informing, squeal­
ing, ratting, et cetera (a fink 
by any other name is the same).
During the Korean War, there 
were innumerable cases erf 
American prisoners aiding their 
captors for the price of an ex­
tra bowl of rice. These indivi­
duals, who lacked all loyalty to 
comrades and country, were in­
terested solely in bettering their 
own lot. A similar situation 
would exist if Mr. Axelrad’s 
suggestion were to go into ef­
fect: students bettering their 
class standings by the failure re­
ceived by a classmate. I wonder 
if the margin of defeat would 
have been as slim (1 vote) if 
the proposal had been changed 
to informing the thief that the 
school was aware of his teft, 
and unless the books were re­
turned immediately, he would 
receive an R in that course. This 
would get the books back to the 
library, but without the easily 
achieved betterment of the in­
formers grades.

Little consolation for any of Tech’s football defeats can 
be derived from the past, or we lost to Penn State. Just to 
show that we were no half-wayers about it we lost 49 to 0. 
The next in line was Waynesburg at home. There was ap­
parently more concern over Tech’s powess in football then, 
but that would not be hard to achieve at all. Any one who 
goes out for a varsity now seems to have something above 
and beyond others. It may be called thick-skin, stupidity, 
school spirit, or dedication, but they do have something that 
sets them apart. Dr. Hamerschlag had a talk with the Mag­
gie Murphs on M & M’s (so named for they all have a 
thin-candy shell) and stressed that they made three import­
ant choices in their lives: choice of university, choice of 
occupation, and finally, choice of husband. Haven’t changed 
much except for, perhaps, their order. It’s pretty much the 
same for religious talks also. Dr. Coyle of the Bellefield 
Presbyterian Church on 5th and Bellefield gave a series of 
talks on ‘the young man’: The young man away from home, 
the young man and his temptation, the young man and his 
habits, and the young man and his symmetrical life. Class 
elections were held and it was noted that the new system 
of voting where nominations were decided by balloting was 
superior.
A Candle in the Darkness
By Jeffrey Axelrad
Democracy
Why is democracy — government by the people — the 
accepted form of government in the United States, and the 
idea throughout much of the rest of the world? Would it not 
be better to give some select group with the proper qualifi­
cations control of the processes of government? Is majority 
government consistent with individual freedom? These are 
all questions about the form of government that seem not 
to concern the average person, although secondary questions 
of state ownership are argued on an international scale.
The first two questions are closely related; if a majority 
is not the ruler of a nation, then some oligarchy must be. 
(Although the alternative of anarchy has much that can be 
said in its favor also.) Democracy in its modern form came 
about chiefly because the “masses” felt (probably correctly) 
that their rules cared little about their welfare. Thus favor­
ing democracy was chiefly a means of revolting against a 
form of government that did not work to the average man’s 
advantage. But how far should this democracy be carried? 
Should illiterates, criminals, non-property holders, etc. be 
given the vote? Or perhaps all that needs to be done is to 
give a “good” oligarchy power.
It is this writer’s opinion that democracy is better than 
oligarchy because it is dangerous to allow one person to 
have power over another unless checks on the governing 
person exist for the governed to use. If these checks do not 
exist, then the ruler may choose to force the ruled to con­
form to his (the ruler’s) wishes. And this is a perversion of 
the idea of government. Also, who is to decide the members 
of the oligarchy? If the oligarchy must be chosen, would 
it not be best to have it chosen by the persons ruled? But 
this is democracy.
The reason for government is to create order and S 
“good society.” To do this the government, no matter what 
its form, must restrict persons who wish to take actions 
other than those set up as guides for the area under the 
control of a particular government. As long as government 
exists, individual freedom must be restricted to some extent.
Majority rule is, in my opinion, the lesser of two evils 
since under this form of control the majority restricts S 
minority, which would seem to be better than a minority 
restricting a majority. Democracy combined with a written 
constitution — accepted by the governed — which limits 
the scope of restriction to cases of “direct harm” would allow 
more freedom than any of the other forms of government. 
But surely individuals must continue to discuss and improve 
upon the ideas accepted or presented in the world of today. 
Democracy is an improvement — not the best possible man­
ner of governing.

Rush Proves Victorious: 
Fraternities Pledge 227 Men
Fall semester rush ended last Monday, September 30 
with a total of 227 Carnegie Tech men assuming roles as 
fraternity pledges. Of the twelve fraternities participating in 
the rush program sponsored by the Council of Fraternity 
„Presidents, each organization received an average of 18.75 
pledges. ?-------------------------------------------------------—
Looking across the ravine to 
Pitt, which very recently declared 
itself a wet campus and will soon 
have to retract its declaration (see 
article on Pennsylvania Liquor 
Control Board, page 2), the rush 
campaign here, by comparison, 
was a huge victory for the system.
^With 16 fraternities at Pitt, they
^Inducted an unofficial total of 200 
pledges at the end of their rush 
campaign. Even here, last year, 
the fraternities saw the addition 
of only 185 pledges to their 
rosters.

ties and their pledges for 1963 are

Corrigan Discusses Theater 
For Oct. 15 Assembly
On October 15 at 11:30, Carnegie Tech students will have 
the opportunity to hear Professor Robert W. Corrigan, head 
of Tech’s fine drama department speak on the modern 
American Theater. Professor Corrigan’s talk, entitled “Vir­
ginia Woolf: Private Illusion is Public Fact” will take
Edward Albee’s play “Who’s* —-----------------------------------------------------
Afraid of Virgina Woolf” as the

high point of what has been hap­
pening in the American theater 
from the times of Ibsen to the 
present. Professor Corrigan will 
discuss in particular whether the 
appeal of the modern play comes 
from its communication of a mes­
sage, or merely fr,om its shock 
value.
The talk is the third in the 
series of weekly assembly pro­
grams offerings. However, this 
week’s program will be given in 
the Fine Arts Theater. Next week 
the assemblies will resume meet­
ing in the Wherrett Lounge.
YM-YW Banquet 
To Kickoff 
Member Drive
Dave Adams, President of the 
Tech YMCA, will be the featured 
speaker at the annual YMCA and 
YWCA Membership Installa­
tion Banquet to be held at 5:20, 
Friday, October 11, 1963, in Room 
100 Ski bo.
Dave Adams, a junior in Chem­
istry, spent this past summer in 
Japan as a participant in a YMCA 
Buildings For Brotherhood Work- 
camp. In addition to meeting and 
working with Japanese students, 
he visited and worked with stu­
dents in Korea and can speak 
presonally about problems con­
fronting students in both coun­
tries.
All YM and YW members are 
especially encouraged to attend, 
and, if space permits, interested 
persons, whether members or not, 
are welcome to come to the ban­
quet, the program, or both. The 
program will begin at 6:30 in 
Room 40.
Paid reservations must be made 
in the Y Office, 57 Skibo, by 1:30 
p.m. on Wednesday, October 9. 
Cost cf the diner will be $2.00, but 
men on contract pay only 40 cents, j
Library Issues 
Ne tv Cards
Beginning October 15, the Hunt 
Library will be charging out one 
and two-week books with a re­
cently installed SYSDAC Book 
Charging Machine. This new sys­
tem necessitates the use of a new 
and separate library card, which 
should be obtained by Tech stu­
dents tomorrow or Friday in the 
circulation lobby. These cards 
will not be used for reserve 
books. Student identification cards 
will no longer be acceptable for 
general book circulation.
The operation of the machine 
will consist of inserting the new 
library card and the book card 
into the machine. It will then 
print the information from the 
ID card on a sticker and attach it 
tp the book card. In this manner, 
the library staff expects to in­
crease the efficiency of charges.
All students are urged to obtain 
these cards and are reminded that 
the machine will not be used for 
reserve books.
Pastor Speaks 
On Theology
Going into its second session 
today, The Theological Sampler 
Series will feature a representa-1 
tive of the Lutheran tradition. 
The Rev. Charles Carlson, Lu-1 
theran University Pastor for 
Western Pennsylvania, will give 
an introductory survey of some 
of the key ideas and concepts 
which are fundamental to the Lu-1 
theran tradition, with emphasis j 
on those things most often mis­
understood by those outside that | 
tradition. Questions, answers, and ¡ 
discussion will follow. Discussion j 
will continue through dinner for 
those who can stay.
The meeting from 4:30 to 5:45 
will be held in 56 Skibo each 
Wednesday afternoon. The week j 
following, October 16, Dr. Ahron j 
Kessler, Dean of the College of | 
Jewish Studies of Pittsburgh, will 
present the Jewish tradition.

*Tech Loses 1st Dusty Night Game 
Waynesburg Passes Spell Victory
by Jay Arnold
Waynesburg College provided the fireworks last Saturday 
night as they dumped the Tech Tartans 34-7. The high-speed 
game played on Waynesburg’s dusty field under the lights, 
was the third straight defeat of this season for coach Gas-
9 parella’s gold Tartans.
Controlling the entire game, 
Waynesburg scored on their first 
series of downs with a 60 yard 
pass play to their weak side end 
McNeil. He was to be their key 
offensive threat of the night in 
their pro-style offense very much 
like Tech’s offense. Tech’s offense 
could not get moving again this

This past Saturday the Women’s 
Athletic^ Association Field Hockey 
Club w*as host to the hockey 
teams of Bethany College, Uni­
versity of West Virginia, 'and 
Chatham College. This sportsday 
opened the 1963 season for the 
^ Tech girls.
Beginning at 12:30, the games 
proceeded until each team had 
played each of the other teams. 
During the afternoon, only 2 
goals were scored — one by Beth­
any and one by Chatham. After 
the events, refreshments were 
served in the Highlander Room 
in Skibo.
President of the Tech club is 
Monica Gosse and the Field Hoc- 
^key Manager is Susan Seibert. 
Others members of the team are: 
Mimi Eakin, Barbara Brown, 
Cece Camardella, Edie Mills, Pat 
Mills, Linda Gursha, Susan Fen- 
stramacher, Karen Cohen, Randi 
Bosch, Nancy Mayberry, Helen 
Beatty, Nancy Beryl, Barbara 
Johnson, Dotty Barnhart, Barbara

The first regular game is at 
4:30 today at Chatham. It is hoped 
^that the games this year will 
^draw more student support than 
previous years.
week and their defense yielded 
two more touchdowns the first 
quarter to put Waynesburg in the 
lead 20-0. Again passing played 
the key role in Waynesburg’s at­
tack. Their second touchdown 
came on an 85 yard punt return.
The firing cooled off the sec­
ond quarter as Tech’s defense 
got down to business and halted 
Waynesburg’s attack. Dave D’Ap- 
polonia and Frank Groll led the 
Tartan defense as they held 
Waynesburg scoreless in the sec­
ond quarter. Meanwhile, Tech’s 
offense began to move under the 
leadership of quarterback, Terry 
Hechler and Tech began to 
threaten. But Tech’s drives were 
repeatedly halted and the score 
remained 20-0 at the half.
In the third quarter, the two 
teams again traded strong offen­
sive blows but Waynesburg’s 
proved to be the strongest as they 
pushed over another score on a
long pass to make it 27-0. Tech 
threatened on a 42 yard pass play 
from Hechler to wing-back Jim 
Black. This put the ball on 
Waynesburg’s 8 yard line, but 
Tech could not push the ball over.
Tech’s score came in the first 
of the fourth quarter on a quick 
drive featuring strong passing. A 
tackle elegible pass to right tackle 
Duane Palmo set up the score and 
the touchdown came on a 14 yard 
pass from quarterback Paul Wis­
niewski to end D’Appolonia. 
Waynesburg wasn’t through yet 
though as they pushed over a 
fourth and final TD in the last 
quarter to make the final score 
34-7 Waynesburg.
Tech’s number-one fullback 
Dave Gilchrist was injured early 
in the first quarter and senior 
guard Kent Baldauf failed to see 
action as he was still recovering 
from a knee injury suffered in 
the Denison game. Both men 
should, be ready to go in two 
weeks against powerful Grove 
City. Tech has an open date this 
week and so two weeks practice 
will be aimed at downing Grove 
City.

Countty Trad In Win
Freshman Harry Burkholder, 
track star from Connellsville, Pa., 
paced Tech’s cross country team 
to victory in its first meet Satur­
day. The squad made it 10 straight 
wins and 16 out of the last 18 
meets as they downed the Jean­
nette Harriers 23 to 37 over the 
Schenley Park hills.
The race promised quite a 
rivalry as Mike Cambell and Ed 
Barvick, former Tech runners now 
at Pitt grad school, ran with the 
independent Jeannette team. But 
Burkholder took Cambell and 
Jeannette’s Milt Gess, by nearly 
a minute. Tech bagged the meet 
solid as Tom Bednarz, Chris 
Macosko, Andy Niedra, George 
Crawford and Herb D’Alo finish­
ed fourth through eighth behind 
Cambell. Paul Fackler. Mike
Engle and Kem Phillips added 
eleventh, twelfth and thirteenth 
places for good measure.
This season looks bright as the 
Harriers face last year’s schedule 
with six veterans and a hos* of 
eager freshmen. Besides Burk­
holder, Engle, Phillips, Dave 
Simons and Chuck Bounds art all 
first year men.
Tall, lean and swift, Burk­
holder has made the letteruien 
quicken their stride. Senior B»id- 
narz showed Harry the 4.3 uiile 
course his first practice. Since 
then the team has seen only the 
back of Burkholder’s T-shirt. Sat­
urday he ran 23 minutes 57 
seconds. The course record set by 
Cambell last year is 23:11. Harry 
turned down a full athletic 
scholarship at Pitt to study 
chemical engineering here.

IM Football Opens Brushing Season
After only a week of play in intramural football, the Early favorites in the Giants 
two pre-season favorites Alpha Tau Omega and the Grad 
Eagles “A” have established themselves as the teams to beat.
ATO, seeded first in the Eagles league, came roaring back 
from a 13-9 halftime deficit to whip a stubborn Grad Eagles 
“B” team 32-16. Led by quarter-*
back Steve Foels, the Taus proved 
to have too much depth for the 
Grads, who had earlier upset 
Xappa Sigma 12-4.
In the Steelers league, the Grad 
Eagles “A” opened with a 35-7 
triumph over BTP “B” with Ko- 
sofsky and Crecine doing all of 
their scoring, and then proceeded 
to defeat an out-manned ATO “B” 
team 50-5 behind the passing 
game of quarterback Bob Murphy. 
DTD took an 11-7 half time lead 
over ATO “B” and went on to win 
31-8. Meanwhile SAE, showing 
signs of turning this league into 
a three team race, whipped the 
Dunkers 35-7 and BTP “B” 20-2.
In the Browns league, top 
ranked PKT met the upset-minded
Whales, and came out on the 
end of it 41-6. In their encounter 
with BTP —Pho however, 
Whales say Lee Collins scored four 
touchdowns as the Betas romped 
23-11. Another contender, DU, 
broke a 6-6 halftime tie with the 
Browns to take a 14-6 decision.
league, TDP and Sigma Nu crashed 
through with victories as expect­
ed. Sigma Nu spotted the Finks 
“B” team an 8-6 lead at halftime, 
and then came back to claim S 
16 decision. The Tau Delts had 
more than a little trouble with I 
Theta Xi, but finally managed S 
12-7 win. In a game rated as S 
Beta Sigma Rho took the 
Dorms 12-3, thereby increasing 
their chances of at least finishing 
in the first division.
4C’ Book Corrections Due
Alpha Phi Omega needs correct addresses, phone num- * 
bers, and departments for the 1963-64 student directory 
which will be appearing in a few weeks. Those students who 
have changed, or just found out, their addresses, phone num­
bers, or department (or even names) are urged to send the 
new information to C-Book, Box 282, Campus Mail, before 
October 6. The only dorm residents who need reply are those 
who have changed rooms since registration. We are particu­
larly interested in students who did not put a local address 
on their registration cards. The following format would be 
most useful:
