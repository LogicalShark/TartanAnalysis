N. S. F. A. Rates Carnegie Student Council Excellent
Campus Delegates Attend 
Convention in Toledo 
During Vacation

Federation Offers Unique 
Non-Profit Travel 
Service
At the seventh annual meeting of 
the National Student Federation of 
America, held at the University of 
Toledo, Toledo, O:, during the 
week of December 27-31, Carnegie 
was represented by H. J. Brennan, 
president, and J. A. Corrigan, treas­
urer of the Student Council. The 
Federation is an organization de­
signed to bring, together delegates 
from various colleges to discuss 
questions affecting students’ inter­
ests.
The N. S. F. A. is composed of 
student members from 364 colleges 
throughout the country and is the 
only organization of its kind. Quite 
a number of problems of both na­
tional and international importance 
were discussed during the sessions. 
In general, it was voted that com­
pulsory military training should be 
opposed; that the United States 
should join the League of Nations 
and the World Court; and that this 
country should take the lead in the 
abandonment of armaments by a 
gradual disarmament. Prohibition 
under the present conditions was 
agreed to be unsatisfactory; the 
delegates favored the retention of 
the Volstead Act, and the problem 
of college drinking was decided to 
be beyond the students’ jurisdic- 
tion.
A comparison of the operations 
of the student councils of the dif­
ferent colleges showed Carnegie’s 
to Jiave several advantages over the 
others. While many schools com­
plained of too. much faculty inter­
ference, here there is less ground 
for such a complaint,

Vassar College, Richard Cadwalla-

WILL SUPERVISE 
RADIO PROGRAMS
Mr. Jewett Heads Broadcast 
Committee
The Tartan has been asked to 
call to the attention of the stu­
dents of the Carnegie Institute of 
• Technology the existence of the 
Faculty Radio committee which has 
supervision over the broadcasting 
activities of the Institute.
The recent inauguration of broad­
casts from the campus by Station 
WWSW has shown the possibilities 
of having Carnegie Tech “on the 
air” for various events. It is the 
desire of the Radio committee to 
co-operate .with the students and 
with the several radio stations in 
Pittsburgh in ‘broadcasting pro­
grams representative of campus 
activities.Students or groups who wish to 
arrange programs for broadcasting 
from the campus are asked to con­
sult A. C. Jewett, director of the 
College of Industries, and chair­
man of the Radio committee. Pro­
grams must be approved by the 
chairman of the committee.
M. M. C. C. Freshmen To 
Hold Box Luncheon Party
To climax the social events 
of the Margaret Morrison 
Freshmen for the present 
semester the girls will have 
a surprise box luncheon to­
gether in the M. M. C. C. 
Recreation Hall .from. 11:30 
to 1:30 today. One quarter 
will be charged for the most 
delicious luncheon ever sold 
on campus for that small 
amount of silver, and, ladies, 
with it will be served tea! 
Come any time during the 
luncheon hour as the affair 
is most informal. During the 
luncheon there will be piano 
music for anyone wishing to 
dance. Guests at the party 
will will be Dean Green and 
Miss Eleanor Gruver, class 
advisor. Elizabeth Stuertz is 
chairman of the affair and 
her committee consists of 
Mary Jane Atchenson, Elsie 
McCort, Virginia Spuhler and 
Helen Conner.
DANCE FOLLOWS 
RESERVE GAME
Buzz Kountz’s Black Cats 
Orchestra to Furnish 
Music From 9 Till 12
On Friday night the Western 
Reserve Basketball team will meet 
Carnegie’s team in the Tech Gym. 
Members of both teams have been 
invited to the dance which will 
be held after the game in Thistle Hall.
Buzz Kountz’s popular orchestra, 
the Black Cats, • which was last 
heard two weeks ago at the Thiel 
basketball game dance, will fur­
nish the music. Buzz Kountz and 
the members of his orchestras are 
famous for the unusual novelty skit 
which they stage. Although the 
game will probably not conclude 
until somewhat later, the orchestra 
will begin playing in Thistle Hall 
at 9 o’clock.
Those attending the game may 
go directly to Thistle Hall through 
the door from the gym at the right 
of the stage. The street entrance 
to Thistle Hall is next to Skibo 
Inn, and signs indicating the ap­
proach are placed, near the walk.
Tickets for the dance will be 
available only at the door, and 
they will be sold at the recently 
lowered price of $1. The complete 
checking facilities, grill room, 
smoking room, and parlors are 
some of the features of Thistle 
Hall, which make it an attractive 
placo for dances.
The faculty members and others 
who have been invited as guests 
for the evening include Mr. and 
Mrs. John M. Daniels, Mr. and 
Mrs. M. S. Mulloy, Mr. and Mrs. 
C. W. Princ, Mr. and Mrs. E. M. 
Pugh, Mr. and Mrs. F. J. Evans, 
and Mr. and Mrs. A. E. Risedorph.
Ping Pong Finals
Held Sat., Jan. 23
Downtown Club Sponsors 
Tournament
Howard Taylor and Edward 
Hemingway will meet in the finals' 
of the Tech Downtown Club Ping- 
Pong Tournament at the club 
rooms, 421 Fifth Avenue, Saturday 
at 1:30.
Hemingway advanced to the 
finals when lie defeated Clark, 
6-3, 6-4. Taylor entered the finals 
with a victory over Robertson by 
scores of 6-2, 6-3.
Over forty members participated 
in the tournament and the keen 
competition is evidenced by the 
close scores turned in. Both final­
ists play a well balanced game 
and a closely fought match is ex­
pected.

Dean is Convalescing
Dean Arthur W. Tarbell, who 
has been in the hospital since De­
cember 26, is expected to leave 
this week.
While crossing the street in front 
of his liome the night after Christ­
mas he was struck by an automo­
bile. Although there were no bones 
broken, he was injured about the 
leg and shoulder. While at the 
hospital he has been receiving 
treatments, and has been allowed 
to discard his crutches for a cane.
Although he has not been told 
definitely, Dean Tarbell expects to 
return to his home tHis week.
Dr. Pugh Aids 
In Solution Of 
Heat Problem
During the past year, Dr. Emer­
son M. Pugh of the physics depart­
ment had been called into con­
sultation with F. C. Iioughten, di­
rector of the Research Laboratory 
of the American Society of Heat­
ing and Ventilating Engineers at 
the United States Bureau of Mines 
to help solve the problem of the 
periodic flow of heat through walls 
of buildings caused by daily solar 
radiation.
The fact that solar radiation is 
an important factor in the mecha­
nism of heat flow into, and out of 
buildings has long been recognized 
by heating and" ventilating engi­
neers. It is usual, however, in prac­
tical heat transmission problems to 
neglect the sun effect entirely, em­
ploy coefficients determined under 
steady state conditions, and con­
sider the average iñsidp and outside 
temperatures constant throughout 
the day. With this practice, factors 
are used to take care of wind, sun 
effect or its absence, or other un­
usual conditions in order to insure 
the selection of a heating plant 
sufficiently large to handle the load 
on the coldest day, or an air con­
ditioning system of sufficient capac­
ity to care for the warmest weather.
Extensive research, carried on by 
the Research Laboratory of the 
American Society of Heating and 
Ventilating Engineers at the Pitts­
burgh Station of the United Startes 
Bureau of Mines, has shown that 
a very large error may be intro­
duced into the calculations by fail­
ure to consider the periodic char­
acter of heat flow resulting from 
the diurnal movement of' the sun 
and the heat capacity of the struc­
ture.Dr. Pugh has developed a theo­
retical formula for calculating this 
heat flow, which by a series of 
simplifying approximations has been 
rtduced to the point where the 
specific problems could' be solved 
by' the use of three simple curves.

Seriously Speaking
A Column of Curious Comment
By NATHAN MILLER
Up From Slavery
We need to be reminded every 
so often of the unique position in 
American society of its “black" 
population—at the present time 
constituting a thick strata of 12,- 
000,000 citizens.
Arc we not apt to take for 
granted this immensely involved 
racial question—until the uglier 
outshots and expressions, such as 
lynching, race riots, miscegenation, 
raise their heads? On the other 
hand, wc arc here confronted with 
one of the most remarkable as­
cents in history of a race from 
the depth of jungle “savagery” to 
fine adjustments to an industrial, 
commercial "civilization.” The story 
is beset with dramatic episodes. '
The story of the Negro in Amer­
ica likewise illustrates in unusually 
clear fashion the degree to which 
social history is molded by econom­
ic happenings. Had it not been
for the invention of the cotton 
gin, slavery would not have been 
exploited to any degree; the lack 
of labor in industrial centers during 
the World war was also the chief 
cause of the tremendous migra­
tion into Northern cities. No 
doubt, the ugliness of lynching and 
discrimination is largely traceable 
to cconomc roots, also.
Investigations indicate two other 
interesting facts: (1) The original 
Negro population drawn into this 
country were of as diverse racial 
(and color) complexes as the pres­
ent, population of Europe; and (2), 
in the contemporary “colored” pop­
ulation, barely one-fifth represents 
pure Negro strain; the rest con­
tain varying strains of white and
Indian "blood. And, lest we for­
get it, some Negroes arrived here 
one year before the Mayflower.
Considering the terrible persecu­
tions, discriminations and involun­
tary migrations of the Negro, one 
cannot but wholeheartedly admire 
the magnificent contributions of 
their race to our culture, and ap­
plaud their efforts to rise still
higher.
Junior Prom Ballroom
Praised By Committee
The English Room of the 
Fort Pitt Hotel, the scene of 
the Men’s Junior Prom on 
February 12, is one of thè 
most beautiful ballrooms in 
Pennsylvania, according to 
the Junior Prom Committee. 
A figured ceiling of intricate 
design, walls paneled with se­
lect grained walnut, and a 
new hardwood dance floor 
are a few of the features that 
contribute to the beauty of 
the English Room. The 
acoustics of the ballroom 
have been developed to near 
perfection. An attractively 
furnished private lobby and 
a large foyer have also been 
reserved exclusively for the 
guests at the Prom.
PLEBES INSPECT 
PITT CATHEDRAL
Masonry Students Given 
Guide By Contracting 
Company
With the Cathedral of Learning 
as their object of study, seven sec­
tions of the Freshman Engineering- 
Industries class and the first year 
Building Construction class have 
made'inspection trips during the past 
week as a supplement to their work 
in Masonary shop. The primary 
purpose of. these trips has been to 
study the methods of handling, de­
signing, mixing and testing the con­
crete used on this building.
During the course in Masonry one 
inspection trip is required, and for 
the last six years the Cathedral has 
been selected because of its proximity 
and the large amount of concrete 
work done on that building. There 
has been more concrete on this single 
structure, the. Freshmen learned, than 
is in the Pitt Stadium. Over 80 sec­
tions, or about 2,520 freshmen, have 
been conducted through the Cathe­
dral, and Mr. Larkin, instructor of 
Masonry, has been grateful for the 
cordiality shown by( the supervising 
contractors. Stone and Webster, who 
have on every occasion provided an 
engineer for a guide.
The foundation, which extends 60 
feet underground to bedrock, was 
studied first. According to the guide, 
out of the $10,000,000 which repre­
sent the total cost of the Cathedral, 
$600,000 is below the ground. The 
concrete for the remainder of the 
building has been designed for an 
average pressure of 2,000 pounds, al­
though the samples which were sent 
to the Pittsburgh T< sting Laborator­
ies showed a strength of. 2,200 for 
practically every cylinder tested.'
Y’s Hold Joint

Junior Women 
Hold Prom On 
Fri., March 18
The Junior Prom Committee wishes 
to remind all junior women that the 
final date for the first installment of 
$2.50 for the Women’s Prom is 
January 23. This payment may be 
made anytime until January 23, but 
must be made by the end of this 
period. All junior women are re­
quired to pay this fee since the dance 
is a class undertaking and liability 
for all debts incurred by the dance 
falls upon the class. The other in­
stallment of $2.50 is payable after 
the close of the first semester. The 
total admission of $5.00’ is lower this 
year since it does not include the 
price of a ticket for next year’s 
prom, as payments in previous years 
did.
The budget for the. dance has been 
presented,to the student council and 
will be acted upon at their meeting 
tonight.
The music for the occasion has 
not yet been selected although the 
committee under Ruth Nye is con­
sidering the following orchestras: 
Sleepy Hall, Jack Pettis, Ace Brigade, 
Jimmy Berger, and Charles Dorncr- 
berger.
The prom will be held on March 
18 in the Urban Room of the Wil­
liam Penn Hotel.
The dance is in charge of: Ruth 
Nye, social chairman of the junior 
class at Margaret Morrison; Maxine 
Piekarski,'vice social chairman; Ann 
Warden, secretary; Eleanor Fahen- 
stock, treasurer of the junior class 
at the School of Fine Arts. Mar­
garet Seibert and Betty Cooper will 
plan the program and invitations, and 
Ruth Phillips will have charge of 
publicity.

SWANN SPEAKS 
HERE THURSDAY
Noted Physicist to Deliver 
Two Lectures on 
Jan. 21, 22
"Philosophic Concepts in Modern 
Physics’’ and “Atomic Structure” arc 
to be the topics of Dr. William F. 
G. Swann, Director of the Bartold 
Research Foundation of the Frank­
lin Institute in Philadelphia, at a 
lecture on Thursday and Friday eve­
nings, January 21 and 22, at 8:30 
in the Carnegie Union. Everyone 
interested is cordially invited to at­
tend.
Dr. Swann, who obtained his B. 
Sc. degree in 1905 and his D. Sc. in 
1910 from the London Institute, and 
who holds an honorary M. A. de­
gree from Yale University and a D. 
Sc. from Swarthmore, was born in 
England where he received the great­
est part of his education.
During the years 1905-1907 he was 
Junior Demonstrator in Physics at 
the Royal College of Science in Lon­
don. For the following six years he 
devoted his time as an assistant lec­
turer and demonstrator in Physics at 
the University of Sheffield.
In 1913 Dr. Swann came to the 
United States as chief of the physical 
division of the Department of Ter- 
restril Magnetism of the Carnegie 
Institute in Washington, D. C. After 
holding the position as professor of 
Physics at the Universities of Min­
nesota and Chicago during 1918-1923, 
he. went to Yale where he was di­
rector of the Sloane Laboratory until 
1927 when he became director of the 
Bartol Research, a position Dr. 
Swann has held, for five years.
Among his responsible positions Dr. 
Swann has designed equipment used 
in Washington at the Carnegie In­
stitute and has written many scientific 
articles, contributing aproximatcly 150 
of them to lead technical journals 
and papers.
Suspense Lifted;
Puppet Out Today
Co-Ed Editors Finally Reveal 
Concealed Facts
At last the women editors of the 
Puppet have lifted the suspense— 
the Co-ed Number of the Puppet 
will go on sale today. There has 
been much mystery about the num­
ber since the women of the staff 
have been in charge. They vowed 
that news of the contents would 
not be revealed until the date of 
issue. That day has’ arrived, and 
you should hear them talk!
The co-ed editors claim they 
have the latest information on col­
lege men, and they have proceeded 
to tell why they dislike them in 
one of the articles entitled, “Col­
lege Men”. “Purely Piffle”, “A 
Co-ed’s Diary”, and “Gossip” arc 
three features that the co-eds hold 
contain the right “dope” about 
everything in general—and they 
should know.
One of the greatest “epics” of 
the times appears in one of the 
short, short stories entitled, “Trader 
Horn and a.Half-Pound of Candy”. 
As in most present-day articles, 
the title is absolutely not indicative 
of the subject matter. The co-eds 
maintain that it is one1 of the most 
scintillating and terrifying tales 
that has been published in a good 
many years. They may be wrong!
Husk O’Hare’s Popular Radio Orchestra To Furnish Music For Mens Junior Prom Held On February 12, At Hotel Fort Pitt
SENIORS OFFERED 
GRADUATE WORK
Men of High Standing Often 
Given Fellowships By 
Leading Schools
Seniors of good scholastic stand­
ing are invited to look into the 
possibilities of graduate work for 
next year. Most of the technical 
schools of the country offer work 
leading to the masters degree, and 
many offer inducements in the form 
of scholarships and fellowships.
Those in the upper third of the 
class are especially urged to in­
vestigate these opportunities for 
post-graduate work. The stipends 
offered vary from the remission of 
tuition fees to sums of money as 
high as a thousand or fifteen hun­
dred dollars. Other schools offer 
teaching fellowships, with part time 
teaching and the remainder of the 
time spent in graduate work.
The Bureau of Recommendations 
has on file notices of graduate work 
and graduate school catalogues of 
all the major technical institutions 
of the country. Seniors should 
make use of this material freely. 
Some of it will be compiled and 
posted on the bulletin boards in 
the various departments.
Art seniors also have oppor­
tunity to try for graduate work, 
at institutions in this country and 
in Europe as well.Most schools require applications 
to be in before the middle of 
March, and ' past experience has 
demonstrated that many seniors neglect to consider the possibilities 
in graduate work until too late.. 
The Bureau therefore invites those 
seniors who feel they would bene­
fit by an additional year’s work to 
use the facilities of its office/
A final request for those who 
have not yet turned in their em­
ployment blanks to turn them in 
immediately is made by the Bureau. 
Those who are uncertain as to 
whether their blanks have been re­
ceived are advised to see the head 
of their department to whom lists 
of those who have not complied

Story Reveals That Library Dept.
Has Trained 800 In 30 Years
Editor’s Note: Little is known 
about the Carnegie Library School, 
though it was officially made a 
part of the Carnegie Institute of 
Technology in 1930. The follow­
ing article gives interesting infor­
mation about the personnel and ad­
ministration of the school.
In the past thirty years, 800 
young women have been trained 
for professional library work at 
Carnegie Library School. In 1901, 
Mr. Andrew Carnegie provided for 
the establishment of a Training 
School for Children’s Librarians. 
Until 1916, when it became Car­
negie Library School, the school 
was conducted as a part of the 
Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh. 
During the next two years, courses 
were added in Library Work with 
Schools and in General Library 
Work. In' 1930, the school be­
came a part of Carnegie Institute 
of Technology.
Carnegie Library School was the 
first one to offer a training course 
in children’s library work. It is 
also. one of the few schools which 
give courses in more than one type 
of library work. The Board of 
Education for Librarianship of the 
American Library Association has
placed the school on its accredited 
list of library schools. There are 
approximately thirty such schools 
in the United States. Carnegie Li­
brary is one of the few library 
schools whose courses are open to 
undergraduates. However, in 1934, 
the school will become a graduate 
school, accepting for entrance only, 
those students holding; an academic 
bachelor’s degree from’ an accredit­
ed college.
Carnegie Institute of Technology 
confers the degree of Bachelor of 
Science in Library Science on all 
graduate students completing the 
library school course. Undergrad­
uates enter as academic library 
students from Carnegie Tech or 
the University of Pittsburgh. In 
June, 1931, the degree of Bachelor 
of Science in Library Science was 
conferred on 150 . former graduates 
of the school. These students rep­
resented 67 different colleges.
This year in Carnegie Library 
School, there arc enrolled 46 stu­
dents, thirteen from Tech, nine 
from Pitt, 22 graduate students and 
two special students. Two places 
are available each year to two 
students who do not have the col­
lege training required for admis­
sion to the school,
Band Recently Completed 
Tour of Sixteen 
States
PRICES REDUCED
Tickets Will Be Sold By- 
Delta Skulls For $6 
a Couple
Husk O’Hare and his Genial Gen­
tlemen of tile Air, one of the most 
popular bands in the country, have 
been selected to play at the Men’s 
Junior Prom that will be held 
February 12 in the English Room 
of the Fort Pitt Hotel. Mr. 
O’Harc’s orchestra is famous for its 
slow, smooth t}rpe of renderings. 
The soft-voiccd hand leader, Mr. 
O’Hare, is an old friend of radio 
fans throughout the United States. 
Twelve years ago his band played 
at Station WTAS in Chicago. 
For seven seasons the Genial Gen­
tlemen of the Air have been fur­
nishing the music at the Casino 
Club, an exclusive resort of Chi­cago society.
Mr. O’Hare has recently con­
cluded a successful ten-month radio 
engagement for the National Broad­
casting System originating in Sta­
tion WENR in Chicago. The Mu­
sic Corporation of America calls 
Husk the “staff statistician”, for 
during his broadcast he kept tab 
of every piece of fan mail he re­
ceived. Exactly 370,000 letters were 
received by the popular band leader.
Husk O’Hare’s most recent tri­
umph was a 33,000-mile tour in 
which the famous orchestra visited 
118 cities in 16 states. During the 
tour the band played before 200,000 dancers.
An influencing factor in the Prom 
committee’s choice of Mr. O’Harc 
was that his band was one of the 
two’orchestras chosen by the ma­
jority of students at the Junior 
Prom Tea Dance vote held before 
the Christmas holidays. Since the 
tea dance, Carnegie students had 
the opportunity to hear Husk 
O’Hare as the headline orchestra 
at the Pittsburgh Intercollegiate 
Ball last Christmas night. As a

COUNCIL CREATES 
THISTLE POSITION
Orchestra Canopy to Be Gift 
of Students
At the Student Council meeting 
of January 12, the position of copy 
editor was created on the Thistle 
staff. Louis Squiticri, a sophomore 
in the Printing and Publishing De­
partment, was appointed as copy 
editor on the 1932 staff. The rea­
son for instituting this office was 
that, heretofore, the Thistle was 
published with errors in it which 
had not been detected by the other 
editors. The duties of the copy 
editor are to read and verify ma­
terial and to correct mistakes. This 
position is not salaried.
The Council has decided to buy 
a canopy for the orchestra plat­
form in Thistle Hall. The canopy 
is intended as a gift from the stu­
dent body and an evidence of 
appreciation for the new room.
The budget of the Margaret Mor­
rison Senate for 1931-32, was ap­
proved as was the petition of 
Scarab for permission to use This­
tle Hall, Thursday afternoon, Janu­
ary 21, for a tea dance.

PAGE TWOTHE CÄRNEGTE TARTANTUESDAY, 'JANUARY 19, 1932.TARTAN S P ORTS PAGE
THIS WEEK brings the first half o( Carnegie’s basketball 
schedule to the most satisfactory end that a Plaid quintet has 
ever experienced. With more than two-thirds of , the games to 
their cr6dit, this same team, minus Captain Jimmy Leonard, will 
have a hard time to repeat their earnings next year.
However, there are five games in the immediate future that 
will tax the entire strength of the Tartan squad. The most im­
portant of these are the contests with Pitt and Duquesne, for 
upon their results rest the city championship.
* * * *
DOCTOR CARLSON AND HIS COLLECTION of ath­
letes will be at home on Wednesday evening to make a last 
stand for their local reputation. Pitt’s recent losses to Duquesne 
and N. Y. U., allow the Plaid tossers to enter the fray with a 
slight edge.
The last Plaid victory over; the Panthers dates' back to 1927, 
with a score of 20 to 24. Only live tiipes has this been repeated 
in the course of the 41 contests between the two schools. How­
ever, the more recent history is gratifying to, Tartan followers, 
for Pitt managed to win by mere two and three-point margins 
last year.* * * ' *
WESTERN RESERVE CAGERS, with their reputation of 
defeating Yale more thoroughly than the Skibo aggregation did, 
will begin their performance in the Gym this Friday at 8:15 
p. m. The Clevelanders will bring a veteran team that possesses 
every desire to return with a Pittsburgh victory.
Geneva, appearing here next. Monday, has a twenty-point 
win over West Virginia, who in turn has defeated our victim, 
Temple.
The scoring of these games is bound to be close, and it is a 
serious question whether Louie Jagnow, if he appears in the 
line-up, will be in his sharpshooting form.
*. * . * *
THE N. Y. U. GAME was an odd bit of basketball. Al­
though the sides of the score board were not far apart, the drab,
professional style of the visitors was not easy to look at. Red 
Silverman broke up the serious routine of play with his uncon­
scious pranks about the floor. His acquisition and consumption 
of cold mince pic is also astounding, just ask him about it.
With the aid of their small court, Grove City defeated the 
Plaid cagers in a hectic battle, 43 to 32. Bob Smith remained 
in the limelight with his dozen points froni the floor and four 
free tosses. Bob’S average to date is ten points per game.

BY THE PUBLICATION of certain facts and figures Mr. 
Overend wishes to straighten out this matter of transferring the 
student Athletic Books. In previous years the Athletic Associa­
tion has tolerated this violation at their own expense. With the 
improvement of the athletic contests the expenses have increased 
along with the number of non-school followers. It is therefore 
up to this group, which includes Alumni and city fans, to co­
operate with the Athletic Association by paying the actual price 
of admission.
The large crowds at some of the basketball games should' 
have made them a paying proposition, but a glance at the figures 
below will quickly show that the transferring of student Athletic 
Books must be stopped. The expenses include only the guaran­
tees and fees for the officials.

ALTHOUGH THE WEST VIRGINIA BOXERS went 
home with a five to two victory, the Tartan coach, Ernie Scsto, 
scored a theoretical knockout o.vcr the Carnegie followers with 
his presentation of a boxing team that won the admiration of 
those present with their scrappy display of the desire to win 
Each man left his bout in good condition, and the same team 
will face the Mountaineers in Morgantown next Saturday.
The fast and deliberate work of Jeff Burke stood out as 
the evening's best performance. A large quantity of credit is 
due H6nry Carr who weathered the storm of the first round, 
and later came back for a clear victory.
* * *' ’*
L-A-A-A-D-I-E-E-E-S A-N-D G-E-N-N-T-L-E-M-E-N-N 
was A1 Minnetti’s theme song for last Saturday evening. A1 
carried things off very well, and we must further congratulate
him for his cheer-leading in the tux, probably the first time in
history.
With all due appologies to the managers, the match would 
have begun on time if one of the cars from West Virginia had 
not met with an accident. The heavyweight, Captain Hawkins, 
suffered a bruised knee that kept him from the ring, but Coach 
Vacheresee, the remaining passenger, escaped without a scratch.
The wrestlers took hold of the delay with their first per­
formance of the year. This material will come into- more serious 
competition in the intramural matches next month.

With anbther tough week ahead 
of them, the Carnegie Tccli basket­
ball tcaih will .find no chance for 
a letup, for, in the next week the 
Tartans meet three of the best 
teams in this district. These team 
arc none other than Pitt, Western 
Reserve and Geneva. Who said 
there was a depression? . Not so 
with the Skibo basketball squad. 
Their" production of baskets will 
have to be maintained at full force 
to enable them..to even bróak even 
with their opponents,
On Wednesday night, Coach Ho­
gan will marshal together his 
forces and invade the Stadiurp in 
order to take over Doc Carlson 
and his Pitt Panthers. The last 
eleven games in which the Tartans 
have taken part this year, no mat­
ter how tough they were, now 
Seem but part of a practice for the 
purpose of getting the Plaid in 
shape for this fray. It has been 
quite some time since the Tartans 
have been able to scalp the Pan­
ther; in fact, it hasn't been done 
for something like the past' 12 
games, but make no mistake, Jim­
my Leonard and his boys are out 
for blood: The Pitt team this year 
does not have as impressive a rec­
ord, as usual, hut they have dp- 
fcated 'some mighty fine teams. In 
the past week they have lost two 
games -^bicli created much interest; 
Wednesday night they fell at the 
hands of Duquesne by the score of 
28-21. Saturday night they were 
nosed out in the last two minutes 
by New York University 37-33. 
Previous -defeats count little in the 
Pitt-Tech contests and the battle 
Wednesday night is going to be 
good.
Western Reserve Wants Win
Two days after the game with 
Pitt, Carncgi'c encounters the for­
midable team pf Western Reserve 
from Cleveland. The game will be 
held in' the Tech Gym. Carnegie 
fans will remember that this was 
the team which made it tough for 
Carnegie in Cleveland and a week 
later journeyed here and put up 
Another stiff :-battle, It: is also the. 
same team which defeated Pitt: iii 
the season’s opener. Western Re­
serve has practically the sanie team 
this year and they are coming to 
Pittsburgh with the. idea qf "tak­
ing” the Plaid.
On Monday night the Tartans 
meet the fast steeping team from 
Geneva. Geneva will enter the 
fray with the ability and will to 
win. Last year Carnegie suffered 
a defeat-at the hands of this SaYnc, 
foe and the visitors arc going to 
try to show that last year's score 
was 110 accident. After the stiff 
Binges on Wednesday and Friday 
nights the Plaid will need the two 
days' rest tp enable them to be 
in condition for the game, These 
hoys from Beaver have been lead­
ing a fast pace this ye;\r. They 
have scored overwhelming de­
feats oyer West Virginia, and W. 
and J. They also defeated b y 
four points 'Grove City, who have 
just conquered Carnegie.
Temple, N. Y. U. Defeated
During the. past week, the Plaid 
won their sixth and seventh straight 
games, but- encountered a barrier 
in the. attempt, at the eighth one. 
Temple and New York U. were 
the victim's of the onslaught of the 
Plaid while Grove City was able 
to overcome the weakened Tartans.
One of the best games that has 
been witnessed on the Carnegie 
floor was played Tuesday night with 
Temple University. Temple has one 
of the fastest passing teams that 
has ever played here and had not 
Carnegie been at their best they 
would have won. . The final score 
was Temple 25, Carnegie 35.
For the first half of the game 
with New York U. on Friday night 
it looked as if the Plaid were , go­
ing to take one on the chin. At 
one time' during the first half, the 
visitors were ahead 11-4, but this 
lead was cut down to three points 
at the half-time. In the second 
half, the- Skibo’s rallied and won 
the game 3Q-25.
Grove City rudely stopped Car*- 
negie's winning streak on Saturday 
night after it had reached seven 
straight victories. The Grove City 
team put 011 a fast' passing attack 
which enabled them to gnin a lead 
which was never overcome. The 
final score was 43-32. , At half time 
the Plaid warriors were behind 20-17.
xJ/M ¿-ZON&RD -çqpr.
Captain Jimmy Leonard, the 
diminutive leader of* this year’s 
basketball team, is one of the 
smallest men playing for any col­
legiate outfit in the country. Jim­
my's speed and dribbling ability 
more than make up for his lack of 
height, and those that play against 
him never get more than their 
share of shots. Captain Leonard 
is the squad's most versatile man, 
having played every position but 
center during his years on the 
varsity.
A native Pittsburgher, who was 
never able to make his high school 
team, Jimmy has fought his way. 
to the top and is the only Senior 
on a team which is probably ’the 
strongest the school has ever 
placed on the floor. He also holds 
the enviable reputation of being 
the one guard in the district who 
consistently held Charley Hyatt, 
the former Pitt All-American, in 
check.

Coach Ncase’s baskctccrs are 
training their biggest guns on the 
Pitt freshmen quintet in • their- an­
nual classic tomorrow night. The 
Tech boys arc determined to hand 
in an undefeated soason, and this 
looks like the toughest game on 
the1 schedule. If they arc success­
ful against Pitt, they should have 
little trouble against the Geneva 
Reserves1 next Monday.Tomorrow night’s game promises 
to rival the varsity game for the 
grandstands. The ICiski game last 
Tuesday was a thriller from whis* 
tie to whistle. By the last five
inutcS, Kiski was leading by a 
five-point margin. A sensational 
five basket surge reversed, the situ­
ation, aiid the Plebes took the 
game.Pitt, playing the same Kiski 
team also came but on the long 
end of a 27-17 score, which is a 
better margin than the Plaid boys 
could hold. This should not give 
the Pitt boys much favor, how­
ever, for Coach Nease has a most 
consistent and reliable team. Carl 
son and Beers make up a nice for­
ward team. Ewalt at center and 
Mihm and Riggs at guard will 
probably complete the lineup.
Wrestling Bouts Prove 
Popular
Preceding the West Virginia-Car- 
negie boxing meet last Saturday 
night, the charges of coaches Rintelen 
and Sommers entertained with some 
interesting wrestling exhibitions. In 
the first bout, Bill Shann and Joe 
Michaeison showed class, with Shann 
winning after about three minutes of 
wrestling. Rodenberg took over 
Cohen in ~ a -match packed with 
thrills. One of the most interesting 
bouts was the one between Dryer 
and Clinger; Dryer won after each 
wrestler had applied some weird 
holds on his opponent. In other bouts, 
Dods defeated Kulasli, and Lowrey 
defeated Aeklcy.

Mr. Clarence (Buddy) Overend 
was seen to smile in his most genial 
manner last Saturday evening. And 
well he might, for his opening box­
ing match was a social as well as a 
financial triumph. Not only were the 
stands comfortably filled, but a good-, 
ly array of Schenley Park’s younger 
set were attired in thoir hard linen.
West Virginia’s squad of extremely 
husky Mountaineers furnished the op­
position for Coach Ernie Scsto’s 
charges, and when the fur had ceased 
flying, it was discovered- that the 
visitors had won four out of , the 
six bouts and had been awarded an­
other by default.
Tartans Greatly Improved 
The Carnegie Tech boxers furnish­
ed an amazing contrast to the 'inex­
perienced band of boys who stepped 
into the arena last, year, for they 
fought their confident and classy 
antagonists almost to a standstill. 
True, the team as yet is not in what 
might be termed tip-top condition, 
nor arc they finished performers, but 
they put up a scrap that was a credit 
to the Tartan sport.
Burke and Carr Score 
Jeff Burke, master showman from 
the drama department, furnished the 
real thrill of the evening when he 
stopped Bob Latham, one of West 
Virginia’s best, in the first round. 
Latham, who himself carries plenty 
of sleeping potion in both hands, out- 
boxed Jeff during the opening sec­
onds of the first stanza, but after 
a furious exchange in' the center of 
the ring, Burke drove him into a 
neutral corner and nailed him with a 
terrific right cross to the head. The 
Morgantown boy went down hard' 
and remained for the count.
The Skibos secured their first vic­
tory of the evening when Henry 
Carr, classy welterweight; successful­
ly fathomed Lowers Hamilton's left 
handed swings for a neat decision. 
Hamilton scored heavily in the first 
round, but in the second episode he 
rail into a terrific left swing that 
floored; him for a count of seven. 
Carr might have won the bout right 
then and there, but lie preferred to 
play a waiting game, and Hamilton 
was able to finish.
Royal Wertz, Tartan 115 pound 
entry, found Morrison too long and 
rangy for him, and the Mountaineer 
boy was awarded a technical kayo 
with twenty seconds' left in the third 
round. Both boys mixed heavily, 
especially in the first and third 
rounds, and Morrison fell from ex­
haustion in his own corner after 
winning the bout.
Ralph Atlas proved a bearcat to. 
Fred Fisher, Mountaineer, lightweight, 
in the second bout of the evening, 
giving blow for blow in every ex­
change. p'isher was awarded a close 
decision after three rounds of heavy 
mixing.
In the 135 pound, class, Bill Ncally 
proved just too. good for. Carnegie's 
Fraser Hcllcgers, and the bout w,as 
stopped at the conclusion of the sec­
ond round.
Tom Waldron, somewhat out of 
condition at the .time, did not seem 
his old self against Charley Paine, 
capable West Virginia light heavy 
weight, and came out on the wrong 
end of a close decision. Waldron, al­
lowed his opponent to carry the fight 
to him in the hope that a good open­
ing for a knockout might present 
itself. Paine, however, was too 
shift}' a performer to lead with his 
jaw.

Powerful Skibo Tank 
Tearn Opens Against 
Wooster Saturday
Saturday, January 23, the Car­
negie Tech swimming team in­
augurates its home season. Woos­
ter, the first opponent of Carnegie 
this year, is one of those Ohio 
schools that is famed for its swim­
ming teams and it was much to 
Tech’s credit that they were able 
to nose out the Ohioans last year 
by the score of 42 to 23.
The return of Coach Risedorph 
has certainly been a wonderful in­
spiration to the 'boys and should 
add the extra incentive necessary 
to make this year’s swimming team 
the best in the history of the 
school. This “best” idea is not 
merely an idle pre-season boast 
for, in recent practices, tank rec­
ords have fallen in almost every 
event. For example’, Wally Dere- 
dyn has set a new low at 2:44 for 
the 220; over three seconds below 
the old record. "Pal” Miller low­
ered the mark in the 100 from 1:00 
to 56j/3 seconds, and cut V/2 sec­
onds from the 50. Ranny Boyer, 
Plaid backstroke star, has changed 
the old record of 1:10 to 1:08, in 
his event. Captain Bill Edwards, 
who, incidentally, swims a very 
good 100 and 220, really' has cause 
for an optimistic’ outlook for the 
coming season, with such an array 
of record breakers.
Other members of this Tartan 
tank team include Franke in the 
50 and Ted Estabrookc, diver de 
luxe. Thompson and Dennison are 
capably handling the breastroke. 
The relay and medley relay teams 
have not yet been picked, but it is 
certain that men placed in these 
events will measure up to the high 
standard of the rest of the team.
The meet Saturday should prove 
a thriller and a real test of a po­
tentially great Carn?gie swimming 
team. As usual, there will be no 
admission charged, the meet get­
ting under way promptly at 2:30.

Alumnae of M. M. Science Dept.
Prove Successful in Many Fields
The alumnae of the Margaret Mor­
rison Science Department have shown 
themselves to be true’ Carnegie 
Graduates by their outstanding suc­
cess after leaving Carnegie. The 
Science Department, now under the 
direction of Dr. Lang and previous­
ly under that of Dr. Watkins, trains 
the students in the fields of chem­
istry, bacteriology, and for graduate 
work in medicine or teaching.
Many of the girls have worked up 
into prominent positions in their fields 
of activity. Blanche Dotterway, M’22 
completed her course at Carnegie and 
then took up medical training at the 
Women’s Medical College at Phila­
delphia, later graduating from Loyola 
College in Chicago. She is now a 
physician.
Margaret McFall, M’25 after gradu­
ation continued her work in bacteri­
ology. She attended Iowa State Col­
lege, there taking her Masters De­
gree in Bacteriology. Miss McFall 
taught a year and is now a bacterio­
logist engaged in research work in 
Binghamton, New York.
Lois McCombcs, M’21 received her 
Masters Degree at the University 
of Wisconsin and was for a while 
technical librarian at Carnegie Li­
brary. She received a fellowship and 
is now studying at Battclle Memorial 
Institute, Columbus, Ohio.
Lucille Wakefield, M’18 and Mary 
Danley, M.’21 followed work in the 
textile field. Both received assistant 
fellowships for Mellon Institute 
where they studied laundry problems; 
both girls are in advertising work 
in New York City.
Anna- Milligan, M’27 received a 
fellowship in organic chemistry and 
took her Masters Degree at New 
York University. She is at present 
engaged in commercial work.
Many of the students pursued 
courses in physiological chemistry, 
and are employed in hospital labora­
tories and physicians’ laboratories as 
chemists and bacteriologists. One of 
these is Genevive Connors, M’27 who 
is now assistant chemist in the lab­
oratory of the Pittsburgh water 
filtration plant. Katherine Anderson, 
M’30 holds a position as a bacterio­
logist in the laboratory of the State 
Health Department of Montgomery, 
Alabama. Margaret Griffin, M’21 is 
employed in the laboratory of the 
Mercy Hospital, Pittsburgh. Char­
lotte Taw M’22, Mary Beam M’23,

To Play For Post 
Holiday Dance
Beat it if you can. After all I 
have written about the “wet” 
weather, we still have “wet" weath­
er. It seems that the more I 
¦write, about it the more rain we 
will have. Now, if this was the 
summer time, it would be a differ­
ent story, because the farmers 
¦want the rain at that period and 
everything will go along serenely— 
oh, yea—how about those picnic 
dates and the trips and the vaca­
tions which just have to be spoiled 
by the rain. Yes, I believe. I do 
hear rumblings and mutterings to 
the effect—who • wants rain, any 
how? Well, I guess it is hard to 
please every one. Some want one 
thing and some want another un­
til nobody is satisfied. Take me, 
for instance, I am never satisfied 
until I can find some secluded 
place where I can take a snooze 
and-forget time is time—a sort1 of 
Rip Van Winkle Idea—how nizc.* * *
Speaking about being satisfied. 
I hardly think some of those stu­
dents are satisfied who find that 
there are no paper towels to dry 
their hands on in the wash rooms. 
The thoughtless individuals are at 
it again. Using more than their 
phare, and the others have to suf­
fer. I believe I read somewhere, 
somehow, sometime, on one of 
those metal boxes which hold the 
paper towels that one was suffi­
cient to dry your hands — why 
reach for another—why? Let’s see 
if we can.be careful in these times 
of repression—that is, provided the 
containers are replenished for the 
night students—and use only suf­
ficient to meet our needs. Score 
one for me.* * *
It won’t be long now until we bid 
good-bye to the first semester and 
•just preceding that time we will have 
the time of our life trying to show 
the profs, that they know les^ than 
wtj do. Yes, they are set to get us, 
but then with the superior intel­
lects of we. ngineers we can make 
tjhefn ail fade away, even the poor 
ndustries don’t have a show when 
it comes to ologyor the like. We 
are thcrc-r-rioticc how we strut 
along. . That, superior air must be 
carried at any cost—even tuition— 
or should I say intuition. At any 
rate, we are there, and it’s no­
body’s business how we got there. 
So say. we ngineers.* * *
Yes, it’s Saturday night next for 
the big blowout of the night stu­
dents. The dance is scheduled on 
the social calendar of the Night 
Student Council for the twenty- 
third, so yours truly will be there 
with feet on to celebrate the event. 
I have never been disappointed at 
any of the dances I have attended 
given by the night students, so I 
am-, sure that this one will not be 
a disappointment. Yes, I am all 
keyed up for the event and can’t 
wait until Saturday rolls by to bring 
me and the girl friend out for the 
time of my night school life—so 
it’s . . . until Saturday, when we’ll 
swap dances and drink punch.
The committee announced that 
the Venetian Serenaders have been 
selected to furnish the music for 
the Post-Holiday Dance to be 
held by the Night Student Council 
this Saturday evening in the Gym­
nasium Auditorium. This group of 
musicians is well known on the 
Carnegie Campus, both to the day 
and night students, and that they 
produce very popular and satisfy­
ing music even to . the most criti­
cal. All the other details neces­
sary to make this a typically suc­
cessful dance of the ‘Night Student 
Council have been taken care or 
and a large attendance is expected. 
Tickets have been on sale for the 
last several weelfs, but if you have 
not yet secured yours, better do so 
at once and come out for one of 
those enjoyable evenings. You will 
Jways recall the event with pleas­
ure. The committee has spared 
no effort to make the dance just 
the kind you always want to at­
tend. Those students who have 
attended the Night Student Coun­
cil dances in the past need not be 
told what is in store for them, for 
they know that the affairs are of 
very enjoyable nature. But to 
those students who .have never 
been out to one of these func­
tions we strongly urge you to 
come and find out just what you 
have been missing and we feel 
sure that you will never miss an­
other one rather will look forward 
to the next affair. Therefore, don’t 
forget—this Saturday evening, the 
Gymnasium will be open, where 
you will have the time of your life 
—Until Twelve.
NOTICE TO ALL
COUNCIL WORKERS
On Saturday afternoon, commenc­
ing at 4:00 o’clock preparations will 
. be started to make the Gymnasium 
' ready for the dance which will be 
held that evening by the Night Stu­
dent Council. All workers, on the 
Council affairs are expected to be 
out for this work.
Puppet Now On Sale
The /Co-Ed number of Puppet will 
be on sale all this week by the 
night sales staff. This is a very 
- good number, and .deserves your sup­
port in appreciation .of the'time and 
effort given to the publication by the. 
co-ed members of the staff who 
have worked to make the college 
ninthly the success it is.
Parking Regulations
Parking regulations for Saturday 
evening are the same as on other 
evenings, and all students are urged 
to exercise care in parking their cars 
as the vigilant police are ever on the 
watch to tag those rash enough to 
be in the wrong place. S‘o be care­
ful and watch your “track" else 
you’ll be it.
Final Arrangements Com­

Parking Problem
In an issue of the daily papers 
of Pittsburgh a few weeks _ ago 
there appeared an article giving 
some views on the parking situa­
tion in the vicinity of Carnegie 
Tech and Schenley Park. The 
head on the article read, “Parking 
at Carnegie Theater," and uhless 
one reads a couple of lines down, 
the inference would most likely be 
that the parking pertained to a 
situation in Carnegie, Pa.
The question was asked: “Who 
is the dictator of parking at Schen­
ley Park, especially about the Car­
negie Tech Theater? Several oth­
er statements were made, some of 
which showed a lack of knowledge 
of the true conditions around our 
campus. The Plaid takes the lib­
erty of analyzing these statements.
First of all, the article was 
prompted by a “suburbanite" from
point about 20 miles northwest 
of Pittsburgh who , evidently had 
secured place on the yearly mail­
ing list of patrons by paying the 
very small fee—the total cost of 
which is not sufficient to purchase 
one good seat for one performance 
of the Follies, or any other popular 
how. On a certain night, the 
journey from the distant point of 
20 miles was undertaken to attend 
performance at the Little The­
ater and what did these expectant 
theatergoers find—all the available 
space occupied by the night stu­
dents who, they say, come from 
as far East as Greensburg. We can 
safely say that night students come 
from more distant points than this 
for their night classes in order to 
obtain an education. Should these 
students move out for the theater­
goers? Let us proceed further 
with the discussion.
The article states that every year 
the parking facilities become more 
restricted and that -one’s suspicions 
are aroused as to whether the 
ing authorities have some grudge 
against the theater and desire to 
discourage patronage of the plays. 
We ask if the author realizes that 
several factors enter into the seem­
ing restrictions which are operating 
on the campus. First of all, there 
is the state law which prohibits 
parking on curves, and since the 
park drives abound with curves, 
it follows that the repellent yel­
low and black signs “No Parking” 
will be plentiful. Next we have 
the entrances to the various build­
ings which have to be kept clear, 
then the fire plugs and other safety 
precautions which have to be taken 
into consideration and which a 
casual visitor, especially during the 
evening, cannot be cognizant of.
On Sunday evening, January 24, at 
8:15 the students of the. Music De­
partment will present a recital in the 
Little Theater. College of Fine Arts. 
No cards of admission arc required, 
and the public is invited. The pro­
gram is as follows:

As to the discouragement of pat­
ronage to the theater—does this 
question need to be considered. 
One trip to the College of Fine 
Arts in an evening just before the 
doors to the Little Theater are 
thrown open will suffice to dispel 
any thought of discouraging pat­
ronage-----the line is legion. If
discouragement were the object, 
then, perhaps, some of the night 
students would be able to get a 
chance to see a performance or 
two. The claim is made that last 
year two roads available then are 
now closed to parking. Why? 
Well, the privilege was abused by 
some thoughtless individuals and 
everyone else has to suffer. It did1 
not matter whether they were 
parked on the lawns or not—hence, 
the sign, “No Parking."
It appears that on the particular 
night in question the party had to 
return home without seeing the 
play after trying to get space on 
Woodlawn Avenue and over at the 
entrance to Schenley Park adjacent 
to the Carnegie Library. In this 
district there are many more ac­
tivities and societies making claim 
for parking space than the Little 
Theater and a little thought on the 
part of the Suburbanite will dis­
close that The Soldiers’ Memorial, 
The Masonic Temple, The Syria 
Mosque, The Carnegie Institute, 
Library and Music Hall, Forbes 
Field, etc., all have activities dur- 
the evenings, and the patrons 
these activities need space to 
park, too.

Carnegie’s Long 
Distance Traveler 
Announced Soon
Mileage Being Piled Up 
By Commuting Night 
Students
When the committee announced 
last week that January 28 would be 
the closing date of the contest which 
is being coriductcd to find out Car­
negie’s night student marathon 
traveler they were hardly prepared 
to receive the 1 deluge of mail that 
poured into the office. However, the 
committee will stand by the guns 
even though they perish in the at­
tempt. They arc now considering ask­
ing Hoover to appoint a national 
committcc to assist them in their 
task of tabulating all the entries. 
Should this idea fail they arc read}' 
to carry this unique contest to a 
successful termination.
Despite the fact that many en­
tries have already been received the 
Plaid is very anxious to hear from 
more of Carnegie’s commuting night 
students. The figures as .now tabu­
lated are rather impressive and'
somewhat of a surprise but we arc 
confident that even these figures can 
¦be beaten.
The committee ruled at the last 
meeting that two winners would be 
chosen instead of one as previously 
arranged. In addition to declaring a 
champion weekly traveler, a cham­
pion traveler for a single evening 
will also be chosen. Some students 
travel many miles each evening but
attend only one or two nip.hts per
week thus having a low weekly
mileage total but a high single eve­
ning total. The committee feels that 
this will add more entries to the 
contest and make the race more in­
teresting than ever.
Just address your letter to the 
N,6ws Editor of the Paild, stating 
the number of miles traveled each 
evening and the total number 
traveled per week, together with the 
evenings spent on the Campus.

striction fair, or hospitable, or nec­
essary? There is plenty of space 
near the theater that could be used 
on such occasions and should be 
alloted to holders of tickets to 
the plays." How selfish. The city 
is indeed hospitable to the sur­
rounding suburbanites in that they 
have free use of the city owned 
parks for which the outsider pays 
no taxes, but on the other hand, 
when it comes to including them 
in the metropolitan area, the indi- 
viduality of the borough is stressed 
long and loud. I wonder how much 
of the .probable available parking 
area in the home town of - this 
Suburbanite is thrown open to the 
public and particularly to a traveler 
from twenty miles away—Pitts­
burgh? I wonder.
We do have a big parking prob­
lem on the campus to solve, cs- 
pecially^ when- three thousand night 
students have to be taken care of, 
and every effort is made to secure 
additional space for parking for 
these night students. We hesitate, 
however, to say that these three 
thousand night students should 
move out to give room to a few 
hundred privileged people who at­
tend performances at the Little 
Theater by holding this place in 
reserve for performance nights. Bv all means NO.

PLAN GROUP ON 
GRADUATE WORK
In connection with graduate work 
at the Carnegie Institute of Tech­
nology a new committee, composed 
of faculty members teaching gradu­
ate work, is being formed for the 
consideration of graduate problems 
and degrees. There will be about 
25 members on the committcc, and, 
as more instructors begin teaching 
in the graduate division, they will 
also join this committee.
The committcc, reporting direct 
to President Baker instead of to 
the Educational Senate, will deal 
with Masters’ and Doctors' degrees. 
The matter of professional degrees 
will remain in the hands of the 
Senate.
A sub-comtnittcc of five or six 
members will arrange the actual 
revision of requirements for gradu­
ate degrees and will report its work 
to the Senate. Because the ap­
pointment of a chairman of the 
group is still being considered by 
President Baker, there has been no 
meeting of the large committee and 
no selection of the smaller one.
The Bureau of Coal Research 
will be one of the teaching units 
in this new plan of graduate work,

Student Athletic Book Violations
During the basketball seasons for the past lew years, 
the Athletic Council has been repeatedly confronted with 
the problem of students violating the rules pertaining to the 
lending or selling of student" athlctic books to alumni and 
the general public. This year the situation has become 
more troublesome bccause of the large demand for seats. 
Already some twenty books have been confiscated by the 
Athletic Council for infractions of the rules.
When each student receives his student athlctic book 
at registration, his name, telephone number, and address is 
written on a 'slip in. the front of the book on which is 
printed:“I hereby agree that I will not transfer this book or any coupon therein, or any ticket received in exchange for a coupon of this book for cither money or gratis. If I violate this agreement 1 for- fc.-it my right to use the remaining coupons of this book, and the Athlctic Council shall have the right 
to compel me to return same to them.”This slip is removed and filed in the Athlctic Office. 
There arc two reasons for requiring such an agreement: 
first, the students are charged an extremely low price for 
admissions to all .of the football and basketball games, as 
well as the: boxing matches; secondly, because of this liberal 
concession, it is*felt: that the students should co-operate with 
llio Athletic Council in making athletics a success, finan­
cially. It is only possible to grant the special student rate 
because of the anticipated income from general admission 
sales.The lending or selling of student athletic books to 
'umni and others jeopardizes the whole of Carnegie’s ath-

4 involved in setting up and dis- 
for.each game, sending teams on trips, 
paying for’ coaches and referees, and buying playing equip­
ment.’ It is only right that the alumni and the general 
public support Carnegie’s teams by paying the regular ad­
mission price.An attempt was made recently to sell the alumni special 
books of tickets for six dollars which contained admittance 
for twelve basketball games and three boxing matches. Ob­
viously, this is a very reasonable offer, but apparently the 
alumni felt that student books could easily be borrowed for 
less than fifteen books were sold.
The rigid adherence to the student athlctic book rulings 
is important because:1. Major athletics which do not pay for themselves
cannot be successfully continued.
2. If athletics are sponsored at a loss, it is not pos­
sible to contract formidable opponents for home
games because a reasonable guarantee cannot be
furnished.
This situation deserves the serious consideration and 
co-operation of every student. The Athletic Council will 
be acting entirely within its rights in enforcing the regula­
tions. J- L.* * * *
The frequent occurrences of “booing” and otherwise 
ridiculing officials at the basketball games in the Gymnas­
ium is bringing discredit to Carnegie and challenging its 
reputation for good sportsmanship. Under the influence of mob 
psycology this undesirable practice takes root rapidly 'and 
affixes itself as a habit that is hard to overcome.
It is the privilege of the officials to inflict penalties for 
“razzing” by the crowd, by calling technical fouls upon the 
home team.
The players and coaches have expressed the wish 
that the students will exercise more judgment in the future. * * * •+
The athletic association, and patrons of boxing at Car­
negie wish to thank those who helped make the opening 
matches a success last Saturday by appearing in formal at­
tire. It is definitely, assured now that the other two home 
meets will be conducted on the same plan.* * * *
Chicago, the city representing one of the world’s great­
est centers' of capital, has had such difficulty with its 
finances that its system of schools is threatened with col­
lapse. With school teachers salaries many months behind 
and the teachers themselves in want, the latest suggestion 
has been to shorten the school year a full month in order 
to prime the budget. It is hoped that the suggestion will 
arouse the public sufficiently that aid will be forthcoming 
to prevent further injustice to the children and the teachers. * * + %
Another suggestion has originated in Chicago dealing 
with the payment of salaries to students under twenty-one, 
to keep them from joining the army of the unemployed, or 
else holding jobs that could be filled by adults. Senator 
Lewis plans introducing such a bill in Congress with hopes 
of raising the money necessary by assessment on payrolls 
throughout the country.
The notion brings out quite forcibly the extremes to 
which persons would- resort to cure this thing called de­
pression.
FROM THE FENCE
Boxin’, Wrasslin’, ,n’ Everything
Isn’t, wrassling more fun? It seems tliat^ most of the time is consumed in resuming holds in the middle of the ring. The late arrival of the West Virginia boxing team caused more than one finger to be revolved around the inside of a stiff collar. Al Minetti crashed thru with the most cnthusastic cheering of the season. Good old Al. Someone asked why he didn’t "fa’ down go boom.” Say fellow, “didn’t you see that stiff front and the djite.” "That there" white bulldog that hangs around school has become firmly attached to the student body. He is now taking baths before all social functions.. And did you noticc—lie barks at the fellows who sneak thru t h e windows. Jeff Burke did 
right nicely. He raps them on the button, sizes them up, and then pushes them over. But say! Why all the dramatics? He is going to look terribly foolish sometime, if his opponent flattens him. And will some one tell us why a tux and an evening gown make such concerted asses out of some people and such pleasant personalities out of others. Even so the splendid turnout of formal attire presented quite a nice atmsophere. When matches or games run so far overtime the dance tax should be cut. A fair price for an evening, but not for an hour. And Mr. Orbin—lie loves his work as a mother loves, licr child. We should thank him for -what lie has done toward making the functions at school more pleasant to attend. And he is trying to raise funds to cover those ugly girders in the ceil­ing with something more attractive. Hi Docl Yep, Ncllcy right in there again. The checking service not so hot this time. They should run four men all the time during rush periods.' * * * *
Let's Play Cops and Robbers!
Half a dozen dorm boys on their way back from Oakland late one eve were demonstrating exhuber- ancc with a series of lung exercises down by the Institute. Warned by the policeman on duty there to be more quiet, they became so but upon reach­ing the Industries building gave another yell for good measure and were promptly picked up by a police radio car and given a nitc’s lodging at the taxpayer’s expense. Discussing riots, etc., with one of the policemen at the station lie retorted if the dorm guys started any monkey business before the Pitt game next year a riot squad would be present and some one ’11 get killed.” Students have been tampering with the pointer to the Westinghouse Memorial that is pjantcd by the walk at the corner of the Library. The officer on duty there warns that anyone molesting the sign is "liable to get a leg broke.” The dorm boys sccin to be picked on by the police, but every time they have been in er­ror to begin with and the police following up
seem to do so overzealously. However, shouldn’t Tech students be men enough to be above resort­ing to moronish methods of amusement such as destroying property and disturbing the public peace? We have heard it said that “the majority of the dorm men arc morons.” On top of that the entire microphone disappeared from one of the drom telephones. That incident was preceded by cable-cutting. Of course, no doubt those incidents arc caused by a few very inconsiderate chaps. How about it? You dorm fellows arc as good as any­one, let’s sec it proved!* * * *
Yea! B. B. Team!

Beast­ly, that 12 o’clock deadline they have. The Sigma Nu’s stamp didn’t go over so hot so they re­vamped it into a cake walk. . . .* * * *

PROFESSORS COMMENT ON 6 YEAR COURSE
Editor« Notes '

Department of Commerclnl Engineering 
"Columbia University inaugurated a 
six year engineering course and I 
understand has practically abandoned 
it. Its failure was not because of a 
fall down from the educational side 
but because such a course did not 
attract sufficient students as con­
trasted with a four year course. The 
real problem in considering such a 
program for Carnegie is whether 
enough students will want to spend 
six years in an engineering course, 
and whether they or their parents 
can afford or will want to pay the 
cost of two added years.”
Proi\ Ii. S. liOWIvR
Department of Pliynlcn
"The Department of Physics has 
a very definite appreciation of the 
advantages of a longer residence al
C. 1. T. for those students who arc 
majoring in Physics.
"In a five year curriculum it would 
be possible to increase the time given 
to general subjects, probably by the 
addition of a year of English and a 
science such as Biology or Geology. 
Additional Mathematics and Mathe­
matical Physics could be included in 
the course and still leave time in 
which the student could do advanced 
work in some special field in which 
lie might be interested.
"At the end of five years the 
graduate would have completed our 
present requirements for the B. S. 
and M. S. degrees, and' would be 
extraordinarily well prepared to 
enter on further study for the Ph.
D. degree.” [
Director W. E. Mott
College of Engineering
"I am glad to compfy with your 
request that I express my views re­
garding ‘the feasibility of the six- 
ycaj engineering program at Car­
negie.’
"Feasible, perhaps; desirable, NO!
"Nevertheless, I am in accord with 
practically every statement contained 
in your editorial. Numerous attempts
have been made at other institutions 
to require six years attendance be­
fore awarding the bachelor’s degree 
in engineering but these plans, to 
the best of my knowledge, have not 
been successful. The students simply 
can not, or will not, spend so much 
time on their preliminary training. 
Five year programs have met with 
more favor and were we in a posi­
tion to carry the additional expense 
and to face a reduction in the num­
ber of students I would favor the 
inauguration of five year programs 
in the College of Engineering.
"The caption of your editorial will 
be answered in many ways. If we ac­
cept the interpretation which some 
commentators have given us of the 
results, of the Pennsylvania studies of 
college students, the reply would be 
—nothing! But, figures to the con­
trary, most of us would agree that 
four years at Carnegie enable the 
great majority of our graduates to 
accomplish much.
"All our programs arc somewhat 
of a compromise and we find little 
criticism of the technical content of 
our engineering curricula. The trouble 
lies further back in our programs
Carnegie Kate Says:
“The depression must be passing —Father Time's stock is up another point this year to 366.”
and it would appear that we have 
not seen to it that the younger 
generation is what the fifteenth cen­
tury Scottish law terms ‘completely 
founded.’ Our underpinning is mighty 
weak in spots!
‘‘A five year program would en­
able us to provide a much broader 
and safer foundation and even in 
the four year curricula I believe we 
could advantageously substitute cer­
tain of . the more basic and broaden­
ing courses for some of the special­
ized work of the upper years.”
uripe des’e dir“
Dept, of Electric Engineering
“Several technical schools have ex­
perimented with five and six year 
engineering courses. The results have 
not been encouraging. One of the 
necessary components of an educa­
tional- institution is a student body. 
Not enough students able and willing 
to pay tuition for lengthened courses 
have enrolled in them. Also, few in­
stitutions arc endowed heavily enough 
to make it possible to provide for 
longer courses at present tuition
rates, for the fees received / from 
students pay little more than half of 
the actual cost of operating a tech­
nical school.
"There is another solution to the 
problem. A man may attend a col­
lege and carry two, three or even
four years of academic study and 
then transfer to a technical school
for the specialized work in his
chosen field. A rational choice of 
subjects in the college will enable 
a man to arrange a satisfactory and 
well-rounded program with a total 
length of five or six years.”

“I am not certain of the desirabil- 
it3r for prolonging the college years. 
But I am certain that our engineer­
ing students leave college ignorant 
of most of the vital program of hu­
man life. They may be prepared to 
make a living, but we do next to 
nothing in .providing them with a 
foundation for life. I consider it an 
educational crime on the part of 
any institute to send out students 
in this day and time ignorant of the 
biological-humanistic sciences.”

visited. Private. hospitality is of­
fered, and native guides, who speak 
English, travel with the groups in 
each country. One point par­
ticularly stressed was the fact that 
the bureau operates on a non-profit 
basis. Much interest was expressed 
in South American and' Mexican 
travel. A resolution was passed, 
whereby the Central Office is to 
prepare an itinerary for South 
American travel to be published

labor of note-taking in class could 
be dispensed with if a stenographer
was employed who would take

and then mimeograph copies. These 
could be distributed for a nominal 
sum. All worked splendidly - until 
the faculty heard of the idea. Now 
one stenographer is out of c. job.
