In a perfect mire the Tech-’Varsity 
was defeated by the W. & J. College 
team last Saturday at Washington, 
Pa. The character of the. gridiron 
permitted nothing but old-style foot­
ball, and but few attempts at forward 
passes or end runs were successful. 
The Tartan players put up a stubborn 
defense at all times against their 
heavier and more experienced rivals, 
but were totally unable in the latter 
part of the game to stand up against 
the W. & J. offence. Dowling was 
severely injured during the game, and 
it is extremely doubtful if he will be 
able to play again this season. Framp- 
ton, Urling and Dowling played well 
for Tech and Price and Freitag excel­
lent for W. & J.

The Builder's Skilled Army.
The construction of a large office 
building is an undertaking which 
demonstrates very well the import­
ance of the work of the general build­
ing contractor, and special attention is 
called on this account to the descrip­
tion elsewhere in this issue of the 
erection of the Trinity and United 
States Realty Buildings in New York. 
Two thousand men make a pretty 
large force for an industrial establish­
ment laid out with careful attention to 
facilitating their work. Such a force 
of men, almost wholly skilled me­
chanics, are now at work on these 
buildings, and it does not require 
much thought to understand that the 
efficiency of this force is tremendous­
ly increased by the same attention 
given to their working conditions 
which is paid to shop arrangements. 
The great success of the leading gen­
eral contractors who handle such con­
struction is to be attributed to the 
skill with which all this detail ad­
ministration is worked out.
Only a trifling amount of materials 
can be stored at the site of the build­
ings, and consequently no small part 
of the contractor’s work has been to 
supervise the preparation of the ma­
terials in the steel mills, quarries and 
shops and to watch its transportation 
to the work. Moreover, after reaching 
the work, it has to be handled most 
carefully, or the expenses will be run 
up tremendously, for it costs less to 
haul a block of stone several hundred 
miles by railroad than to move it 
around two sides of a large building 
from a storage place. Accordingly in 
this work most of the heavy materials 
have been handled - by derricks from 
the trucks practically to the places 
where they will be used. All kinds of 
mechanical appliances have been em­
ployed, driven by steam, electricity 
and compressed air as was most con­
venient. It is safe to say that the 
reading of this article will furnish 
many new ideas to those who are un­
familiar with the work involved in 
such operations, and will indicate to 
the students in engineering colleges 
the technical and financial opportuni­
ties which are connected with the con­
struction of large buildings.—Engineer­
ing Record.

Mrs., Cobden-Sanderson, the English

She spoke a few words on the political 
position taken by women in England.
Valuable hints about writing a let­
ter:
Use good paper and black ink.
Be prompt. Be brief. Be polite.
Don’t gush. Don’t scold. Don’t 
argue.
Spell correctly. Use good English.
And finally: Never write a letter at 
all unless it is really necessary.
—Spare Moments.
Teacher (dictating)—“He is every­
thing that is manly, grand, and noble.” 
Is that not too much to ask of the 
mind ?
Pupil—It is not too much to ask of 
the mind, but may be too much to ask 
of the man.
Miss R. says that phrases do have 
to be “introduced” after all. Proper 
young lady.
Ask Miss Tebbetts about the poor 
little clause “that caused all the 
trouble.”
Miss H. says that in Antri, it is so 
very warm that the inhabitants have 
to go to bed.
Miss Yohe (in Chem.)—What are 
those little pieces?
Prof. Esquerre—Phosphorus.
Miss Yohe-—The big pieces are, but 
are the little ones?
Prof. Esquerre—Those are “big 
phosphorus” and those are “little phos­
phorus;”-------o-------

To the tune of “Marching Through

They told us when we came here that 
we couldn’t give a dance,
But when we saw the Juniors, why, we 
boldly took a chance.
We put our wits together and our 
strength against the door.

Chorus.
Hurrah! Hurrah! we’ll give another 
dance,
Hurrah! Hurrah! we will wait no 
chance—
We’ll put our wits together and our 
feet upon the floor.
1910 forever.
The Juniors then together got and 
blacked the dizzy steeps,
And questioned every Plebe that came, 
at first, indeed, quite meek, 
But after then a little while, the Plebes 
past them did file.
1910 forever.

THE TARTAN7
000:000CKh^ChX><WhX*0<^hXK‘000g 8S Plebes Lose to East Liverpool ó
The Plebe foot-ball team were de- j 
feated in a hard-fought game at East 
Liverpool last Saturday by a score of 
4—0. The game was not won until 
the final whistle had blown, and in 
fact, it looked as though our young­
sters would win in the last few min­
utes.
Crawford and “Cap” Harter played 
the star game for the Plebes and were 
given an encouraging “boost” in the 
Liverpool papers.
The Game.
Carnegie won the toss and the 
Scholastics kicked to Boots, who re­
turned the leather only one yard. On 
the first play Carnegie gained a yard 
and the second down Agnew reeled 
off seven. Ash Crumley easily made 
it first down. Carnegie then hit the 
line twice for a loss of four yards 
and they were forced to kick, Stillwell 
receiving the punt. The Scholastics 
got away with a whirlwind start. Mer­
cer gained five yards through tackle, 
Geer went for four more and Still­
well made it first down. On a trick 
play the locals lost the ball, and Tech 
started on a voyage that looked dan­
gerous. The locals, however, took a 
brace and the Tech team was forced 
to kick. Stillwell received the ball 
and promptly returned it to the 
Tech’s 10-yard line.
From this on it was a matter of en­
durance, with the Scholastics having 
a shade the better of the argument. 
The whistle ended the first period 
with the ball in the middle of the 
field.
The second half opened with Tech 
booting to Schar, who returned the 
ball 11 yards. Surles circled the end 
for three yards and Stillwell got five 
more. Geer went into the line for 
five and first down. Mercer eluded 
the Tech ends and ran 11 yards, the 
longest run of the game. The locals 
got away with a pretty, forward pass 
which netted them ten yards, Mercer 
receiving the ball. Surles tried the 
end but failed to gain. Stillwell was 
given a try but lost four yards. The 
Scholastics were forced to kick.
Crumley of Tech gained seven yards 
through the line and Ash made it 
first down. Boots hit the tackle for 
four yards, Agnew made seven around 
the end but on an offside play. Tech 
was penalized five yards. Boots again 
went into the line for a gain of six 
yards. Wagner on an end run lost 
six yards and Boots punted to the 
locals’ 25-yard line.
On the first play the locals got 
away with another forward pass, 
which netted them seven yards. Geer 
then hit the line for seven yards and 
first down. Mercer gained five yards 
around the end and Surles lost three 
on the next play. Geer again came 
to the rescue and made it first down. 
The Scholastics worked the ball to 
Tech’s 35-yard line and Geer was 
tried against the line again for no 
gain. Mercer tore off five and this 
brought the ball to Tech’s 30-yard 
line in a sea of mud. Stillwell drop­
ped back of the bunch and Purinton 
by a perfect pass put the ball into 
Stillwell’s hands. And the pig-skin 
sailed high over the cross bar, scor­
ing the first and only points of the 
game.
Stillwell’s kick was the best one 
ever seen on the field and it seemed 
to knock the ginger out of the Tech 
men. Schar booted to Tech and they 
returned it eight yards. By line 
bucks they brought the ball to the 
middle of the field where the locals 
held them for downs. Geer hit the 
tackle but failed to gain, Mercer cir- 
-cled the end for a single yard and 
Stillwell kicked out of danger. Ag­
new gained five through the line and 
Ash added four more, but as they 
lined up the whistle ended the strug­
gle with the ball near the locals’ goal.

manner in which the Princeton tiger 
has been transformed into an amphib­
ious animal is unique, and he seems 
to realize that a due appreciation of 
the steel king’s gift requires a gen­
eral use of it. Everybody at Prince­
ton wants to row.
If the lake degenerates into a mere 
training pool for a couple of dozen 
young specialists of other universi­
ties in championship contests, the 
gift will be of doubtful value. If the 
lake remains a playground for the 
whole student body, arousing general 
interest in a wholesome exercise and 
expanding lungs and hardening mus­
cles that otherwise might atrophy,
Princeton may set a new standard in 
college athletics which will remove 
the last vestige of opposition to such 
sports.
Intercollegiate rivalry and cham­
pionships have their uses, but they 
should be the means and not the end.
Perhaps Carnegie Lake will show 
the way.—Ex.

“The teaching machinery is made 
up of two elements, professors and 
instructors. The professors are a 
small body of men entirely surround­
ed by knowledge. In some cases, this 
is bounded on the North by a piece of 
chalk, on the East by a blackboard, 
on the South by a text-book he wrote 
himself, and on the West by an idea 
he got once. The instructors are 
divided into two classes—those that 
do and those that don’t.—The Mass.

The faculty of Minnesota University 
has practically decided to revert to 
the old five-day system of registration. 
It is unanimously the sentiment 
among the instructors that the six- 
day plan is a failure. The chief rea­
son seems to be that the students 
carry too many subjects and the good 
students overwork.
The entire student body of the Ore­
gon Agricultural College have con­
demned hazing.
Germany last year reported 45,136 
students at its twenty-one universi­
ties, while Russia had 24,434 at ten 
institutions.
Cornell has about seventy-five men 
trying for the Freshman class team.
The night before every big game 
at Lafayette, a smoker is given by 
the Athletic Association. Each fellow 
brings his own pipe and tobacco, and 
the Freshmen furnish the matches. 
Speeches are made by alumni and 
prominent men about the college. 
Songs and yells are practiced, and 
enthusiasm is thereby raised for the 
game on the following day.
The University of Pennsylvania has 
an exhibit at the Jamestown Exposi­
tion. It includes original manuscripts 
and letters of Lafayette, Franklin and 
Washington.
Bowdoin freshmen are required to 
wear broad-brimmed straw hats with 
high crowns painted dark green. 
The Brown freshmen, true to their 
name, are wearing brown skull caps. 
Oberlin freshmen have decided to 
wear white hats with red bands, white 
sweater vests with red edges, red

Making Blue Prints.
By Jacob Glogan.
One of the important sections in 
mechanical drawing is that of Blue 
Printing. To obtain a blue print you 
must have what is known as a tracing 
of the drawing. To get the tracing, 
tracing paper or tracing cloth is used, 
tracing paper is an almost transparent 
cloth which is placed over the origi­
nal drawing and then the tracing is 
ttnade. There ^re two surfaces on 
tracing cloth, namely: the smooth or 
glazed side and the dull side. The 
dull side is the side which you place 
against the original drawing.
After the tracing is ready, the blue 
print is made. Blue print paper can 
be obtained in any mechanical draw­
ing supply store, but if you wish to 
make it yourself, it is made as fol­
lows: Dissolve 1 ounce of ammonia
citrate of iron in 6 ounces of water, 
and in a separate bottle dissolve the 
same quantity of potassium ferri-cy- 
anide in 6 ounces of water. Keep 
these solutions separate and in a dark 
place or the solution will be of no 
use. To prepare the paper, mix the 
same amount of each solution and 
with a sponge or soft cloth spread it 
evenly over the surface. Let the pa­
per remain in a horizontal position 
until the chemical has set on the sur­
face, then hang the paper up to dry. 
When drying, see that no light strikes 
the paper or it will lose some its 
value.
To make a blue print from the 
tracing, place the tracing with ink 
side down against the glass surface 
of the printing frame, then take the 
blue brint paper and place the sensi­
tized side down on the tracing, on the 
top of the paper, place a felt cushion 
(which generally accompanies a good 
printing frame) and then place the 
hinged back of the printing frame on 
top. After this is done, expose to 
the sunlight. The exposure will vary 
with the strength of the sunlight. To 
make good blue prints, being guided 
only by the exposed edge of the sen­
sitized paper, take a small test piece 
of the same paper and a piece of 
tracing cloth with a few lines drawn 
on it, and expose that to the sun­
light the same time that you exposed 
the large print. By having a dish of 
water at your side, you may tear off 
at different times pieces of the test 
blue print and wash it in the water. 
If the test piece shows up in a deep 
blue color and clear white lines, then 
it is time to take tne big print out. 
After the print is taken out, it should 
be washed in cold water for ten min­
utes and then should be hung up to 
dry. Corrections can be made on the 
print with an ordinary writing or rul­
ing pen and a solution of washing 
soda, caustic potash, strong ammonia, 
or any other alkali.
To obtain sharp lines on a blue 
print, all lines on the tracing should 
be heavier than on ordinary drawing 
paper and a sharp inking pen should 
be used.
By using the following, prints hav­
ing blue lines on a white ground or 
just the opposite of a blue print may 
be obtained: 3 ounces of common
salt, 8 ounces of ferric chloride, 3% 
ounces of tartaric acid, 25 ounces of 
acacia, 100 ounces of water. Dissolve 
the acacia in half the water and dis­
solve the other acids in the rest of 
the water, then mix the two together. 
The solution is applied with a brush 
to a well-rolled paper in a subdued 
light. The paper should be dried as 
quickly as possible on account of the 
acid eating into the pores. When the 
paper is dry, it is ready for use. 
One or 'two minutes are sufficient in 
strong sunlight and a considerable 
longer time in a dull light.
To develop the prints, it must be 
washed, after leaving the frame, in 
a very weak solution of potassium 
ferricyanide. None of this solution 
should touch the back of the print. 
Developing takes but a minute or two. 
If the background of the print is of a 
blue color, the print was not exposed 
long enough, and if the background 
shows a pale blue color, then the
print has been exposed too long.
When the development is complete, 
the print is washed in clean water for 
two or three minutes and then placed 
in the following solution for ten min­
utes: 3 ounces of sulphuric acid, 8
ounces of hydrochloric acid, and 100 
ounces of wrater. In this solution all 
the iron salts not turned into blue 
compound will disappear. After this 
is done, the print is washed in water 
and then allowed to dry.
One of the important uses of blue 
prints is its use in the shop to the 
mechanic or engineer. The best ad­
vice to be given to them is to take 
the blue print and mount it on a paste­
board back, but if it is desired to keep 
the prints in first-class shape, mount 
them on sheet-iron backs, and then 
apply a coat of varnish over each 
side so as to make it waterproof.
To make drawings from the prints, 
the blue prints may be inked over 
with waterproof ink and when thor­
oughly dry washed with a solution of 
oxalate of potash; treated thus, the 
ink lines will remain and the blue 
ground will fade, leaving the back­
ground wrhite and appear like an orig­
inal drawing.
Erasing on tracing cloth, in case of 
mistakes or errors, should be done 
with an ink eraser or a sharp, round 
erasing knife. The surface of the 
tracing cloth must be made smooth 
in those places where erasing had 
been done. This is done by rubbing 
the cloth with soapstone or powdered 
pumice stone applied with the fingers.

When a body of strangers takes the 
helm of another body there is usually 
“something doing.” 1911 took the 
helm of 1912 and threw “it” out the 
window. And he is their president.
The inter-class affair of last Wednes­
day night may well be termed a malo­
dorous one. Why ?
Last Wednesday night the class of
1911 held their second regular class 
meeting. As previously stated routine 
business was dispensed with and the 
meeting was cut short in order to at­
tend the more carefully to the invasion 
planned by the “kindergarten.” The 
meeting itself was unique in that it 
was held at the door with the chair­
man sitting on the railing around a 
lantern from which point he could see 
the plebian rattle on the outside.
By a little scrimmage Master Helm 
(he will soon rise to the dignity of 
Mr.), the president of 1912, gained 
entrance to the lecture room. He was 
attended by two ruffians and a cheer 
went up when the three braves broke 
in.
The wonder and dismay of the ad­
miring throng can better be imagined 
than described when the three of them 
came limping in through the main 
entrance, In order to set at rest any
suspicion of supernatural aid Helm 
told his thoroughly frightened ad­
herents that they had been allowed to 
enter and the scrimmage was put up 
as a bluff. After having the two safe­
ly inside the door was closed with a 
little difficulty and the 1911 gentlemen 
fell upon the three captives and threw 
them out of the window.
Success No. 1 for 1911.
At this juncture the meeting was 
called and hurriedly carried through. 
The “cute young things” tried several 
times to get in but the watchful mar­
shal at the transom armed with a 
quart bottle of fresh hydrogen sulphide 
solution kept them from the door. 
After the meeting a rush was made 
by the 1911 members and while the 
game “kids” were not afraid of the 
men, the hydrogen sulphide was a 
little too much for them and they fled 
in the wildest disorder.
Success No. 2 for 1911.
After a restoration of order a truce 
was patched up and hereafter all dif­
ferences between the two classes will 
be settled on the field of legitiamte 
athletics. Immediately following the 
agreement 1911 issued a challenge for 
a series of events including a football 
game, basket ball game, tug-of-war, 
wrestling and such like.
(This is as it should be as the 
weekly fracas is beginning to tell not 
only upon the participants but also 
on the night student body generally.)
Things must be in a pretty state 
when even the prospect of a fight will 
not bring out a quorum, 1911 must 
have heard that their new president 
was due for a speech.
It w'ould be wise if all the night 
school classes wrere to stay a half 
hour or so once a week to practice a 
few yells for the Lehigh game. 1911 
has selected a cheer leader for her 
section and no doubt they will be 
heard from. (They usually are.)
The “pie squad” is enrolling new 
members every night. Any one, irre­
spective of class, color, creed or con­
dition, is eligible. The membership 
has risen from five members to twen- 
ty-six at latest accounts. Emii Litz, 
the taker, ought to give the organizers 
of the squad a commission and also 
pay the Tartan the price of this “ad.”
The class of 1911 is of so little con­
sequence to the makers of the direc­
tory published in last week’s Tartan, 
as to be entirely ignored. It is not 
the omission of the officers’ names that 
is hereby objected to but the mislead­
ing statement at the head of the 
column which says “Societies and 
Classes.” If it had been “Societies 
and Some of the Classes” there could 
not have been any objection as the in­
ference that some were left out would 
be plain enough for any one to grasp. 
As it was, however, the complete 
ignoring of the only night class which 
is always awake, is a slight which the 
members feel keenly and one they 
know how to resent.

Dr. Hamershlag addressed the stu­

last Friday morning at 11:45. It is the 
first time this year that the Director 
has met the entire student body to­
gether, and his remarks, especially 
those in reference to the so-called 
Knockers Club, were enthusiastically 
received. He made reference to the 
several acts of destructiveness on the 
part of students, and said that he did 
not condemn this in general, but he 
believed it was a man’s duty to report 
his act in order that the entire stu­
dent body should not stand the cost 
of repairs. In making mention of 
ihcse students who are ever ready to 
offer unkind criticism to every stu 
der.t organization, he said: “While 1 
am not a believer in hazing or in that 
variety of horse-play that is hazing 
under another name, I do believe that 
some punishment should be meted out 
t. > that individual who is constantly 
offering criticism to the detriment of 
the organization.”

School Spirit.
It could not have escaped the notice 
of any one who attended the mass 
meeting on Friday, that there are few 
men who know the Alma Mater Song. 
It is a most unfortunate state of affairs 
that shows but ten or twenty men re­
sponding to the call for the school 
anthem, and the most of them repeat­
ing the first verse three times. The 
Tartan has published in the current 
issue a copy of the Alma Mater and 
every Tech man should take it upon 
himself to memorize the words at 
once.
Alma Mater Song.
(Tune: Auld Lang Syne.)
Let all our voices now be raised 
In song to fill the air;
And all our hearts with music praise 
Our Alma Mater fair.
Let all the echoes ring out clear,
In joyful strains so true
And greet the Tartan with a cheer,
Red, yellow, green and blue.
Carnegie Tech, we honor thee,
And fondly sing thy praise;
We pledge our lives in memory 
Thy sons on high to raise.

Bates Wins A gain.
On last Friday afternoon the second 
of the series of three cross country 
runs was held. The course was,about 
two and one quarter miles in length 
and ten men competed. The finish 
was more exciting this time than the 
last, for Wylie pushed Bates hard for 
first place. The men seemed to finish 
in better condition than before, show­
ing the effects of the daily practice.
The result is as follows: First,
Bates; second, Wylie; third, Reed; 
fourth, Koethen; fifth, Rignamont; 
sixth, Hudson; seventh, Street; eighth, 
Ferguson; ninth, Seisel; tenth, Bieler.

The Orchestra.
It is with great pleasure that we 
are able to report the resurrection of 
the defunct orchestral organization. 
We believe, too, that this third lease 
of life has been sufficiently well nour­
ished at the birth to insure its con­
tinuance for some time. A large 
number of men have shown a lively 
interest in its development, and the 
co-operation of the school is all that 
is now necessary for success. Mr. 
Henry Fuller, a graduate of Kneller 
Hall, England, has been appointed 
leader, and with the brilliant record 
he brings with him, we have little 
hesitation in saying he will prove ca­
pable. If, as we have prophecied, 
the orchestra does become an entity, 
it will prove an invaluable adjunct to 
cur musical organization.

Rehearsal of Mandolin Club on 
Sunday, November 17, at 2.30 P. M. 
Any student playing mandolin, guitar 
or violin come.
All candidates for Senior Dramatics 
are requested to hand their names to 
the committee at once. Every one is 
earnestly urged to try. Committee— 
Merrill, Sampson, Foster.
Extensive preparation is being 
made toward the entertainment of 
the Lehigh foot-ball team on Thanks­
giving, and the committees that have 
been appointed for this should have 
the satisfaction of knowing that every 
Tech man is behind them, and ready 
to back up their efforts. The commit 
tee on entertainment has secured 
from the management of the Grand 
theater a number of tickets to be dis­
posed of among the students, and if 
every man responds Tech can have a 
school night at that theater. The 
tickets will be on sale next week. 
Every student sign up now.

J. H. Taxis, Editor.
A meeting of the combined Musical 
Clubs was held on Sunday, October 
27, and action was taken on the resig­
nation of Mr. Robt. Parsons as man­
ager. Mr. Summers suggested that 
the new manager be a student of the 
schools, but not a member of either 
the Glee or Mandolin Clubs, so that' 
his duties as manager would not in­
terfere with his duties as either a sing­
er or player. This plan received the 
approval of the club and Mr. L. C. 
Frank of Class 1910, Night Electricals, 
was elected to fill the position as man­
ager for the coming year.
Mr. Frank is perfectly competent to 
fill his position, being employed as a 
traveling salesman in the Pittsburgh 
district and possessing business 
sagacity that will redound to the credit 
of the club.
The condition of R. W. E. Moore, 
who is still in the Columbia Hospital, 
remains unchanged although signs for 
improvement are expected each day. 
A box of flowers is sent him each week 
by the class.
All the sections of the class are 
down to solid work and the prospects 
are that the four evenings a week 
will continue. The work this year is 
very interesting and approaching the 
nature of what the men have been pre­
paring for during the past two years.
Among the Mechanicals—The “same 
old crowd who walk eastward on 
Forbes street, when they should ride 
westward,” is evident in this section 
as is evident from the rumors arising 
concerning a society about to be form­
ed for educational (?) and social (!) 
improvement. More about this society 
will be reported later.
Among the Electricals—While the 
class is small, still the work is carried 
on with enthusiasm and both the .in­
structors are kept busy answering 
questions hurled at them by the future 
Electricians.
Among the Civils—All are deeply
engaged in their studies and work 
hard at all times. Mr. Reed has al­
ways been a friend of 1910 and they 
all give him their best efforts.
Among the Chemists—Silence, that 
suggests greater things later.

The largest railroad engine ever 
built will soon be completed at 
Schenectedy, N. Y. It is made for the 
Erie Railroad, and its weight will be 
413,000 pounds or over 200 tons. Its 
traction power will be 94,800 pounds, 
and it will be able to haul a train of 
loaded cars a mile and a half long. 
This locomotive has four cylinders, 
and is practically two engines com­
bined in one. From the cow-catcher 
td the rear of the tender it measures 
83.10 feet.

An Electrified Steam Railroad.
An electrified steam railroad with 
a number of unusual features is in 
operation in Southern Indiana. It was 
built originally as a steam dummy line 
for freight and passengers and has 
been called the Evansville, Suburban
& Newburgh Railway from its early 
days, although its most important 
branch has lately been from Evans­
ville to Boonville, the county seat of 
Warwick County. The road was 
originally constructed with 40-Ih. rails, 
but when permission was obtained to 
use electric traction the roadbed was 
greatly improved. About 2,200 cubic 
yards of limestone ballast to the mile 
is used, the ties are white oak and 
laid 17 to the 33-ft. rail, and 701ft. 
rails are employed. All told there are 
28 miles of main line track, and an 
affiliated company is building 24 miles 
more, between Newburgh and Rock- 
port. There are 500-ft. sidings at 
intervals of about 4 miles. Current is 
purchased from the Evansville Gas
& Electric Light Co. There are three 
combination baggage and passenger 
cars, two passenger cars and an ex­
press car for electric traction, while 
for extraordinary demands there are 
twelve passenger cars and three steam 
locomotives of the enclosed type. The 
company is one of the very few elec­
tric lines belonging to the American 
Railway Association and to local as­
sociations of steam roads, which gives 
it the right to receive car-load lots 
from other companies and to bill cars 
from its own system to foreign points. 
It has track connections with the 
Southern and Illinois Central roads 
and has 32 standard gondola and box 
cars for its- freight business. The in­
crease in coal mining along its line to 
Boonville has been so marked that a 
standard locomotive and more gon­
dolas will be bought to handle the 
additional traffic. Cars are run every 
sixty minutes between Evansville and 
Boonville and every eighty minutes be­
tween Evansville and Newburgh. The 
fare is 2 cents a mile, reduced by com­
mutation rates to 1% cents. Two 
steam freight trains are run each way 
daily between Evansville and New­
burgh. Since electricity was adopted 
as motive power for passenger service, 
enabling single cars to run at closer 
intervals than the schedule of steam 
trains, the amount of travel has in­
creased nearly 40 per cent.—Engineer 
ing Record.
