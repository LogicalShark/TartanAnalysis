For most of us, crossing the street 
is as routine and simple as eating and 
drinking. But for people who are visu-
ally impaired or who have other dis-
abilities that impede their ability to 
move freely, crossing the street can be 
a stressful experience at best in a traf?c 
system not always designed with their 
needs in mind.
Researchers at 
Carnegie Mellon’s 
Robotics Insti-
tute, with the help of a $2 mil-
lion grant from the Federal Highway 
Administration (FHWA), are aiming 
to change this situation by researching 
smart traf?c signals that can commu-
nicate directly with smartphones and 
adjust green-light times to accommo-
date those with disabilities who would 
require longer times to cross an inter-
section, or warn the user if the traf?c 
signal detects that he or she is moving 
outside the intersection.
One of the project’s leaders, Stephen 
Smith, a professor of robotics, 
revealed the thought process 
behind the idea of using 
smart traf?c signals to better 
accommodate those with special 
needs in an interview with The Tartan.
“I began thinking about the idea a 
few years ago after giving a talk on our 
traf?c signal control work to the Gold-
en Triangle Council for the Blind, and 
hearing their perspectives and prob-
lems on pedestrian navigation through 
intersections,” recalled Smith.
Thus, when he heard about the 
Accessible Transportation Technology 
Research Initiative (ATTRI) sponsored 
by FHWA, he seized the opportu-
nity to start exploring the idea of us-
ing technology to mitigate the issues 
that special-needs pedestrians face at 
intersections.
“My group had already been 
working in the area integrating adap-
tive signal control with emerging 
“connected vehicle” technology, where 
vehicles equipped with dedicated short 
range communication (DSRC) radios 
communicate directly with the inter-
section, and extending direct commu-
nication to pedestrians with disabilities 
seemed like a natural idea,” explained 
Smith.
Smith and the team involved in 
the project aim to develop a mobile 
app that can run on a smartphone 
equipped with DSRC capability, which 
will facilitate the main part of the com-
munication between pedestrian and 
intersection traf?c signals. They also 
hope to integrate this communication 
feature with Surtrac, a system combin-
ing arti?cial intelligence, traf?c theory, 
and real-time traf?c data to optimize 
traf?c signal control to reduce waiting 
times, congestion, and pollution. Sur-
tract was also developed in Carnegie 
Mellon’s Robotics Institute and led by 
Smith with support from the school’s 
Traf?c21 and Metro21 initiatives. Sur-
trac already has shown tangible ben-
e?ts: according to a university press 
release, in Pittsburgh, Surtrac has 
“reduce[d] travel time by 25 percent, 
braking by 30 percent, and idling by 
more than 40 percent.”
“Most basically, the app will encode 
and allow communication of the pe-
destrian’s personal crossing constraints 
(namely travel speed) to the intersec-
tion, and the signal control system 
will ensure that the pedestrian is given 
suf?cient green time to cross,” Smith 
explains.
Additionally, the app will also make 
use of the smartphone’s GPS system 
to monitor whether the pedestrian is 
crossing outside of the crosswalk and 
whether it is necessary to further ad-
just the traf?c signal timing based on 
the pedestrian’s progress through the 
intersection. The team also plans to 
use route information from the pedes-
trian’s smartphone to streamline their 
travel by anticipating the user’s arrival 
at certain intersections.
Smith says the team plans to do 
?eld testing with volunteers from the 
local blind community in the East End 
of Pittsburgh, where the Surtrac system 
has already been deployed, and even-
tually develop a system that can work 
for people who have other disabilities 
as well. It could be useful to many peo-
ple who live in suburban areas where 
pedestrians are infrequent and signals 
do not always accommodate them.
Since smartphones do not generally 
have built-in DSRC capabilities, the test-
ing will require out?tting a DSRC sleeve 
to the testing subjects’ smartphones, 
but future phone models could inte-
grate such a feature if it proves useful, 
according to Smith in a university press 
release. Ultimately, the driving force be-
hind the project is integrating modern 
technology into our infrastructure in 
order to improve safety and mobility for 
pedestrians with disabilities.

On Sept. 28, the Worlds Within exhibition presented a 
panel discussion with Rob Kesseler, Worlds Within artist 
and Steve Tonsor, Director of Science and Research at the 
Carnegie Museum of Natural History. The accomplished pre-
senters discussed how the relationships between artists and 
scientists have evolved into partnerships and presented cases 
of the avenues for the intersections of these two disciplines 
they have seen, as well as potential avenues of collaboration 
in the future.
Kesseler began the talk with his story. At the start of his 
interdisciplinary career, he spent much of his time struggling 
to get his work published, one of which was a book of pho-
tographs of pollen. One primary obstacle is getting scientists 
to collaborate with him and the interdisciplinary work he 
was describing. A large focus, he contended, was the ben-
e?ts that initiatives give to scientists, both tangible and in-
tangible. Through some struggle, he established a book deal 
with a small publishing ?rm. His ?rst book, titled Pollen: The 
Hidden Sexuality of Flowers, is colorized microscope electron 
images. This work was only possible because Kessler found a 
scientist excited to work with him: Madeline Harley, a pollen 
researcher at Kew Gardens with a background in interior de-
sign and a passion for the beauty of the images of pollen she 
was making for her research practice. That was the start of a 
series of books he decided to dedicate himself to. Her story, 
like the others, centers around the idea of giving experimen-
tal projects a chance to bene?t both artists and scientists. 
Kesseler later worked with artist exchanges for an institute in 
Portugal, a hub for contemporary art that embraces creative 
direction and interdisciplinary minds. He performed assign-
ments that required color additives, such as slicing extremely 
thin plant stems and colorizing them for various tests. He ex-
plored the process by manipulating the colorizing method, 
applying it at various points throughout the lab that scien-
tists would not otherwise apply, thus showing scientists a 
way to look at a process like they never have before.
This thinking was put into practice at the Royal 
Microscopical Society, where programed outreach to kids 
was created to get children interested in science as more 
than just lab work. Showing that projects like these are as 
much art as they are science gets the foot in the door for 
them to be understood, an important step to allow outside 
parties to take the work more seriously and allow support 
for that type of work to be established.
Tonsor presented next, with an interesting take on 
reasons to think outside traditional parameters. Having 
worked at the Carnegie Museum of National History, he is 
not shy in applying science to philosophy. His quest for the 
sublime, for example, is continuous and signi?cantly affects 
his personal philosophy of discipline exploration. His anec-
dotes include a moment where he saw moths ?ying beauti-
fully in the moonlight. With a fervent enthusiasm to natural 
sciences, he started experimenting his quest by dissecting 
things, literally. However, his path into science rendered 
him trapped in a process of strict discipline. Tonsor talked 
about Kant and the sublime, the scienti?c method where 
a theory is explicable. The traditional method of scienti?c 
thinking is an idea or theory that runs through trials, with 
the individuals attempting to falsify it by testing it with dif-
ferent variables, a rational principle that includes a concrete 
goal. But the really great theories, he argues, are not ratio-
nally created. They are created arational by nature, which 
scares scientists, but should not consequentially be ignored, 
he argues. That is why a lot of scientists who make a lot of 
impact were involved with art in their lives. His own initial 
experience with artists, he admitted, was at ?rst thought 
of as ridiculous, but because he felt like he lost the sublime 
and wanted to get back in touch with it, he expanded his 
perspectives and started appreciating the practice and the 
avenues it crosses with science, where it addresses things 
one cannot explain.
Tonsor encourages people to think arationally and 
interact with the pool of the unknown instead of strictly 
sticking to the scienti?c method since this approach can 
allow artists and scientists to bene?t each other.
Interaction with the unknown connects scientists and artists

Welcome back, students 
of Carnegie Mellon! Af-
ter a summer full of new 
and fulfilling experiences, 
whether they were intern-
ships, research positions, 
or relaxing at home, we are 
already back in the swing 
of things and ready to start 
off the semester while con-
tinuing to put our hearts 
into the work. As your stu-
dent representatives for the 
2017-2018 school year, we 
have strategized on how to 
provide the most enriching 
student experience at Carn-
egie Mellon. The student 
body executives, along with 
members of Student Senate 
and the Graduate Student 
Assembly, were elected to 
tailor the student experi-
ence with the needs of our 
growing community. We 
are incredibly excited to 
share with you all the new 
initiatives that student 
body government has to 
share for this semester.
Student body govern-
ment has identified four 
main pillars that demon-
strate our priorities for this 
school year: mental health 
awareness, fiscal transfor-
mation, collaboration, and 
diversity. Students with a 
passion to improve each 
sector were appointed to 
the Student Body Presi-
dent’s Cabinet to spearhead 
the initiatives of each pillar. 
The mental health aware-
ness pillar focuses more on 
providing students with a 
more accurate understand-
ing of the demands of their 
courses as well as figuring 
out how to make wellness 
a more viable option. Fiscal 
transformation deals with 
the finances of the univer-
sity and making university 
transactions more trans-
parent to students. The 
collaboration pillar aims 
to unite student organiza-
tions and provide greater 
entrepreneurship opportu-
nities to students. Finally, 
the diversity pillar focuses 
on the inclusion of students 
of all backgrounds. To 
accomplish the goals of 
each pillar, we are working 
with university administra-
tion and entities, such as 
Counseling and Psycho-
logical Services and the 
new Center for Diversity 
and Inclusion, to meet the 
needs of the entire student 
body.

Dept. of Statistics name change re?ects shift in the ?eld
SWETA KOTHA
Junior Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity’s ?rst-year class of 
2021+ has a majority of 
women for the ?rst time 
in the University’s history, 
marking another milestone 
among the top universities 
that are bridging the gender 
and minority gaps in certain 
?elds. 51 percent of the class 
of 2021+ are women, and 
speci?cally the proportion of 
women in Carnegie Mellon’s 
six undergraduate colleges 
continues to increase.
Interim president Farnam 
Jahanian, interim provost 
Laurie Weingart, and Dean 
of Admissions Michael 
Steidel suggest that Carn-
egie Mellon’s progress in at-
tracting more women in the 
last few years is the result of 
strategic academic and pro-
fessional planning within 
each college, as well as the 
whole university’s endeavor 
to prioritize building a sense 
of community based on 
diversity and inclusion.
This year especially, 
women make up 57 percent 
of Tepper School of Business’ 
undergraduate class, which 
is not just noticeably high 
among top-ranked national 
business programs but also a 
personal feat for the college 
itself, since this percentage 
is 12 percent higher than 
the already-increasing rates 
from last year.
Robert Dammon, Dean 
of Tepper, explained that 
Tepper is distinguished as a 
business school, because it is 
at the crossroads of business, 
technology, and analytics. 
Recently, Tepper’s academic 
programs as well as its al-
location of resources has 
helped drive speci?c niches 
in the college to increase in-
clusion and teamwork-based 
projects.
Tepper’s Community 
Conversations is just one of 
the undergraduate initiatives 
taken by the college across 
its undergraduate, masters, 
and doctoral-level programs. 
In Tepper Community Con-
versations, undergraduate 
students, faculty, and staff 
members discuss opportuni-
ties and methods to enhance 
learning experiences. The 
construction of the David A. 
Tepper Quadrangle provides 
physical, localized learning 
spaces for school-based and 
professional collaboration.
In a university press 
release, Steidel states, “As we 
look at the factors that helped 
attract this record-breaking 
class, each college and 
school has its own story to 
tell.” Women make up 49.8 
percent in the freshman 
class’s computer science pro-
gram and 43 percent of the 
freshman class’s engineering 
program. Also, Mellon Col-
lege of Science has its larg-
est ?rst-year class ever with 
285 students including in-
terdisciplinary scholars, and 
Dietrich College of Humani-
ties and Social Sciences was 
recently hailed for its grow-
ing number of students, par-
ticularly women, in its most 
popular ?eld of statistics and 
data science.
All this happens as 
Carnegie Mellon admission 
rates show increased 
competition as incoming 
SAT scores remain high, but 
it is important to remember 
that numbers can only tell us 
so much. Any school should 
not merely count or recite 
the numbers of its women or 
other minorities; this is only 
considered an advancement 
if paralleled with progress 
to build a better community. 
As seen in the case of Tepper, 
Carnegie Mellon should be 
celebrated for its dedication 
to “de-bias” certain pro-
grams, monitor how under-
represented groups succeed, 
and prioritize inclusivity in 
all settings.
Women make up majority of Carnegie Mellon first-years

The name change from 
the Department of Statis-
tics to the Department of 
Statistics and Data Science 
was marked by some inter-
esting statistics of its own. 
Applicants to Dietrich think-
ing about studying statistics 
have doubled since 2013, 
and the number of under-
graduate statistics majors is 
four times the size of what 
it was in 2010, and twenty 
times the size of what it was 
in 2003.
This change was prompt-
ed not by an abrupt shift in 
what the Statistics Depart-
ment does, but rather was 
meant to re?ect the shifting 
state of the ?eld. “Because 
our approach to statistics 
encompasses the essence 
of what data science is and 
can be, we have decided 
to change the name of the 
department to the Depart-
ment of Statistics and Data 
Science. We feel this name 
more accurately re?ects 
the department’s position 
on the leading edge of re-
search and education in 
a data-rich world,” stated 
Richard Scheines, the Dean 
of Dietrich, and Christopher 
Genovese, head of the 
Department of Statistics and 
Data Science in a Dietrich-
wide email.
As “big data” becomes 
more and more central to the 
work of the Statistics Depart-
ment, the work done by the 
department is also on the 
cutting edge of the techno-
logical atmosphere preva-
lent at Carnegie Mellon, as 
evidenced by the degree 
in Statistics and Machine 
Learning offered jointly by 
the Department of Statistics 
and the Department of Ma-
chine Learning in the School 
of Computer Science.
The Statistics Department 
at Carnegie Mellon has al-
ways somewhat defied clas-
sification. It is housed within 
Dietrich, and as such, takes 
a uniquely social-science-
geared approach to statis-
tics. “Our statisticians and 
data scientists exemplify the 
Carnegie Mellon approach 
to the humanities and social 
sciences, which infuses foun-
dational and deep research 
across disciplines to take on 
and offer solutions for issues 
that are important to the 
world today,” stated Richard 
Scheines in a university 
press release. Some knowl-
edge of statistics is required 
for all Dietrich students, so a 
change in the mission of this 
department touches dozens 
of majors in this university.
The distinction between 
data science and statistics is 
sometimes blurred, but often 
statistics tends to veer more 
into the realm of the theoret-
ical, while data science tack-
les the interpretation of large 
data sets. The Department 
of Statistics and Data Sci-
ence has long pursued both, 
even before the re-brand. 
“For the past 50 years, we 
have made a big impact in 
both statistical theory and 
applying those theories to 
real problems and real data 
in ?elds from genetics and 
astronomy to sports and ?-
nance,” stated Christopher 
Genovese.
The real world 
application of theoretical 
and technical concepts is 
a cornerstone of both the 
philosophy of our university 
and the practice of data sci-
ence, so this approach fit
s easily into the larger 
mission of the depart-
ment. “Our curriculum 
is designed to give 
students a taste and 
a wide variety of 
experiences of 
what it is 
like to do 
statistics and data 
science in the real 
world. We take prob-
lems that are real 
— from research, in-
dustry and govern-
ment — and put 
them straight 
into the class-
room,” said Re-
becca Nugent, 
director 
of under-
graduate 
studies.

New Title IX interpretation undermines victims
SPEAK
YOUR
MIND.
forum@thetartan.org
Every 98 seconds someone in 
the United States is sexually as-
saulted. Going through such har-
rowing events can have severe 
emotional and psychological 
impressions on the victim. In most 
cases, perpetrators of these acts 
are able to walk away freely with-
out punishment for their actions, 
thus silencing the voice, dignity, 
and rights of the people they have 
sought out as prey.
Rather than working to ?ght 
for these victims, Secretary of Ed-
ucation Bestsy DeVos has decided 
to focus her efforts on giving the 
accused of such crimes, who she 
argues are treated unfairly, due 
process and a larger voice in the 
matter. The newly proposed Title 
IX guidelines to be implemented 
at colleges supposedly seeks to 
make investigations into sexual 
assault allegations more equitable 
for both the accuser and accused. 
These new guidelines remove the 
two month time limit on investiga-
tions, allows the accused to appeal 
the accusation against them, and 
raises the “preponderance of evi-
dence” to a “clear and convincing 
evidence” standard.
But many are worried these 
new guidelines limit the rights 
previously held by victims of sex-
ual assault, making allegations 
against the accused harder to 
prove, and thus making it increas-
ingly dif?cult for survivors to seek 
the justice they deserve.
The restructuring of Title IX 
practices onto college campuses 
is one of many changes made by 
the Trump Administration to ini-
tiatives made under President 
Obama’s Administration. Title IX 
of the Education Amendments Act 
of 1972 states that “no person in 
the United States shall on the basis 
of sex be excluded from participa-
tion in, be denied the bene?ts of, 
or be subjected to discrimination 
under any education program or 
activity receiving Federal ?nancial 
assistance.” In the Obama-era, the 
Of?ce of Civil Rights asserted that 
this law should be applied to all 
schools to protect girls and women, 
usually the victims of these crimes, 
from sexual assault or harassment. 
This has led to the creation of Title 
IX of?ces at many universities that 
train students and faculty mem-
bers on how to respond to allega-
tions of sexual harassment or as-
sault while also strengthening the 
university’s actions in response to 
such allegations.
Carnegie Mellon University has 
adopted its own Of?ce of Title IX 
Initiatives and a sexual harass-
ment and sexual assault policy to 
foster a positive living and learn-
ing environment “that promotes 
the con?dence to work, study, in-
novate and perform without fear 
of sexual harassment or sexual as-
sault.” This policy lays out detailed 
procedures to address complaints 
and identify instances of sexual as-
sault and provide students with re-
sources to deal with their effects.
The most controversial part of 
Obama’s original Title IX assertion 
was that schools were told to adopt 
a “preponderance of evidence,” 
which places more emphasis on 
how convincing evidence is over 
the amount of evidence presented 
to decide if a student is respon-
sible for an act of sexual assault. 
Instances of sexual assault usually 
take place in private rooms, with-
out outside witnesses, making 
proof beyond a reasonable doubt 
dif?cult to gather. This lower bur-
den of proof set forth by the pre-
ponderance of evidence standard 
takes this into account and allows 
for an increase in actions taken by 
school of?cials in response to sex-
ual assault allegations.
Many critics of this act, such 
as DeVos, have argued that Title 
IX’s enforcement at schools less-
ens the point of view of those ac-
cused, thereby ignoring their ?rst 
amendment right to freedom of 
speech. Last year, an open letter 
by 21 law professors argued that 
although “sexual harassment rep-
resents unacceptable conduct, and 
those found responsible should be 
appropriately sanctioned,” the Of-
?ce of Civil Rights has “unlawfully 
expanded the nature and scope of 
institutions’ responsibility to ad-
dress sexual harassment, thereby 
compelling institutions to choose 
between fundamental fairness 
for students and their continued 
acceptance of federal funding.” 
Since colleges stood to lose ac-
cess to student federal aid if they 
didn’t implement this act, the law-
yers argue that this led to colleges 
choosing to side more heavily with 
victims of sexual assault, thus 
downplaying the accused’s side of 
the story.
“The union bosses made it 
clear: They care more about a sys-
tem — one that was created in the 
1800s — than they do about stu-
dents,” DeVos said in a speech giv-
en at Harvard University. “Their 
focus is on school buildings instead 
of school kids. Isn’t education sup-
posed to be all about kids?”
Even if the Of?ce of Civil Rights’ 
actions were an administrative 
overreach that placed the behav-
ior of universities under strict 
federal scrutiny, it led to a quick 
and immediate response by school 
of?cials to listen to the “kids” at 
their schools. These actions made 
students feel more empowered 
to come forward after being as-
saulted, to make known the ordeal 
they had to live through, thus, to 
some degree, giving them back the 
power that was taken away from 
them by such an act. Raising the 
level of evidence to be presented 
takes those rights away from stu-
dents, and limits the progress that 
has been made to make instances 
of sexual assault known.
But just because a school has 
to take sexual assault allegations 
more seriously, doesn’t mean that 
school of?cials should feel com-
pelled to implicate the accused 
student to make it seem that 
they are being proactive. A 2010 
study conducted at Northeastern 
University indicates that the prev-
alence of false allegations is be-
tween two percent and 10 percent 
with a disproportionate amount 
of those accused and punished for 
committing acts of sexual assault 
being men of color.
The point of Title IX is for uni-
versities to be made aware that 
such acts are taking place on their 
campuses and to take allegations 
of sexual assault more seriously. 
According to the Rape, Abuse, & 
Incest National Network (RAINN), 
women in college are three times 
more likely to be victims of sexual 
assault than those not attending a 
university, but only 20 percent are 
likely to report this, believing that 
it is a personal matter that they are 
compelled to deal with on their 
own out of fear of retaliation and 
shame. Harboring such thoughts 
can often lead to depression and 
thoughts of suicide. How can we 
make progress to let assaulters 
know that their actions have con-
sequences if we don’t give victims 
a safe and supportive outlet to 
share their experiences?
Many universities, such as the 
University of Colorado, have cho-
sen to stick to the guidelines put 
in place during the Obama-era. 
In a statement made by Holly 
Hippensteel and Jamie Edwards, 
representatives of Carnegie 
Mellon’s Of?ce of Title IX Initia-
tives, the university does not plan 
for these new guidelines to imme-
diately impact sexual assault pre-
vention and response efforts at the 
university, but is moving forward 
to develop a new policy through 
public comments.
“We remain committed to pro-
viding support, resources and 
information to individuals in our 
community who have been im-
pacted by these issues and to pro-
viding fair, prompt and thorough 
investigations and resolution to 
community members who seek 
resolution through the University,” 
Hippensteel and Edwards said in a 
statement.
Schools should be responsive 
to acts of assault that take place 
on their grounds. Students have 
rights, and it is the duty of the 
university to assure students that 
their rights will not be violated, 
to assure students that they will 
listen to their students’ concerns 
and do all they can to deal with 
the matter. Sexual assault is sim-
ply not a crime that lends itself to 
providing proof beyond a reason-
able doubt, when it is well known 
that such clear proof is not always 
obtainable. It is, ?rst and fore-
most, a violation of a woman’s 
civil rights.

There are about 13,000 stu-
dents at Carnegie Mellon. They 
come from dozens of different 
countries and have very different 
cultures. They have lived very dif-
ferent lives, with different experi-
ences. They study different topics 
and have different passions.
I knew all of this way before 
my Masters program started. 
After all, these are well-known 
facts that you can easily ?nd on 
Carnegie Mellon’s Wikipedia 
page. The university is proud 
to hold a large, heterogeneous 
community, and eager to repeat 
it in public announcements or 
Facebook posts. Besides, many 
universities in the United States 
or worldwide have an equally rich 
community. Still, this was a shock.
It was a positive shock, mostly. 
In the French school where I grad-
uated, only 500 students were 
admitted every year through a na-
tional competitive exam. Before 
taking it, we studied for two years 
in classes especially designed to 
prepare students for this exam, 
along with thousands of other 
students throughout the country. 
All of us followed more or less the 
same program — it focused on sci-
ence and a whole lot of math. All 
of us did the same exercises that 
we found in the same books. And 
eventually, for those entering this 
school, all of us had very similar 
undergraduate courses despite 
our respective majors.
In other words, we did not have 
different backgrounds — each 
student knew about everything 
the others did in the school and 
throughout the two years before. 
There were some international 
students, of course — but only 
a hundred, coming from a small 
set of countries used to sending 
students in that speci?c place. A 
lot of them even came to France 
before to do that same two-year 
training program.
Imagine how new the Carnegie 
Mellon experience is for me! In my 
own graduate program in com-
puter science, I have met people 
who have little in common with 
me. Some of them are American 
and come from different states, 
where they usually had typical 
undergraduate programs in com-
puter science — but not all of 
them: one majored in linguistics. 
In either case their last four years 
were not like mine. Some of them 
are Indian, and by talking to them 
I learned that the Indian selection 
system for scienti?c higher edu-
cation had similarities with the 
French system — which I never 
would have guessed before. Some 
of them worked a couple of years 
before joining Carnegie Mellon, 
while my professional experience 
sums up to two small, mandatory 
internships. And we came here 
with different hopes and goals in 
mind.
And when I widen my horizon 
to other departments or schools, 
it’s even way more impressive. I 
have met MBA students, math stu-
dents and professional musicians, 
whose backgrounds have nothing 
to do with mine — which is great! 
If you haven’t had the chance yet, 
I recommend you take any op-
portunity you have to leave your 
college or department and meet 
different kinds of people. And the 
idea that despite all that separates 
us we are all Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents is really amazing.
There is just one small prob-
lem. If Carnegie Mellon Univer-
sity students are so different, if 
we come for such various rea-
sons, to get educations that don’t 
look alike, then what exactly are 
Carnegie Mellon students? Let’s 
imagine that in ten years I meet 
a fellow alumnus who was at 
Carnegie Mellon at the same time 
as me, but I don’t know person-
ally. I honestly don’t know what 
we could talk about, what com-
mon memories we could share 
and smile about. Obviously what 
courses we followed or which pro-
fessors we knew wouldn’t serve 
as common ground. So only a few 
anecdotal points remain. How the 
campus was. What you thought of 
Pittsburgh. A few funny emails, 
maybe. And memes on Facebook 
groups.
I think that isn’t enough. A uni-
versity should build a community, 
and a community is built on things 
to share. Although a less diverse 
community may not be very rich 
or interesting, an overly-diverse 
one has trouble even existing, be-
cause it lacks common ground. 
I am exaggerating, of course: we 
still have Carnegie Mellon’s motto 
to share, “My heart is in the work.” 
Admittedly, we all work a lot — 
which also has a drawback, as 
stated in this column’s previous is-
sue. Still, I believe we could share 
more than that.
But we won’t make compro-
mises on student diversity just 
to have more in common, will 
we? Of course not — that would 
be a terrible and stupid sacri?ce. 
So how do you build common 
ground when you lack common 
background? Well, the answer 
lies in the question: by building it. 
Actively. Through university-wide 
events, or non-academic projects 
we could all take part in.
Such things already partly ex-
ist. Orientation, for example, is a 
great initiative — but is only one 
week long. There are also a lot of 
student associations, and a cou-
ple of traditions: the Fence, the 
Spring Carnival, etc. Some day 
this column will tackle them spe-
ci?cally and re?ect on how tradi-
tions could be more involving for 
students. In the meantime, this ar-
ticle’s point is: participate. Build 
common ground, and if there isn’t 
enough, make more. And to start 
with, don’t forget to leave your 
own college sometimes. Not to 
enhance your resume, but just be-
cause in ten, ?fteen, twenty years, 
this will constitute your Carnegie 
Mellon identity.

National anthem protests are about racism, not patriotism
CASSIE SCANLON
In an effort to gain some brownie 
points with veterans and out of anger 
from a rejected invitation to the White 
House by Golden State Warriors 
basketball player Stephen Curry, 
President Donald Trump tweeted calling 
for the ?ring of players who protest 
during the anthem at National Football 
League (NFL) games. In response, the 
Steelers, along with other teams, did 
not take the ?eld during the anthem, 
resulting in angry fans who saw the 
act as disrespectful to the military. 
However, these protests across the 
NFL aren’t about disrespecting the 
American ?ag and our military, they’re 
about racism and police brutality.
While Steelers president Art 
Rooney issued a statement claim-
ing that Steelers did not want to say 
anything political by not standing 
for the anthem, the team certainly 
said something. 
Football fans can-
not expect the NFL 
to stay out of political issues when 
the President of the United States calls 
for the ?ring of certain players. The 
Steelers did not take the ?eld to respect 
the rights of their fellow teammates, not 
to disrespect the military.
The Steelers claiming that they did 
not take the ?eld during the anthem 
to avoid making a statement is the just 
organization trying to appease angry 
fans. As someone who has family who 
served in the military, I was raised be-
ing taught that the ?ag is symbolic of the 
sacri?ces made for this country. I cannot 
imagine a time where I would kneel dur-
ing the anthem. However, I acknowledge 
that symbols, like the American ?ag, can 
be open to more than one interpreta-
tion. For me, America has treated me 
well. But, this is not the case for a great 
amount of American citizens who are 
still overcoming racial barriers. I have 
never taken offense to anyone kneeling 
during the anthem, and I never will. For 
them, America has not been well. For 
them, the ?ag stands for institutional-
ized racism and the obstacles they face 
for something as arbitrary as the color 
of their skin. Colin Kaepernick, 
the player who began the 
movement last year, even 
decided to take a knee instead of 
sitting after a conversation with a veter-
an last year. There is nothing more these 
players could have done to make it clear 
that kneeling is a way for them to bring 
light to issues and generate a discussion, 
not show disrespect for the military.
Protests during the anthem are not 
violent, and peaceful protests should 
be encouraged in a democracy. No one 
is harmed when someone kneels during 
the anthem. NFL players have a large 
following, and this following can be 
used as a platform to bring social justice 
issues to light. While Kaepernick has es-
sentially been blackballed from the NFL, 
his protest from last year has been a suc-
cess. It is the next season, and not only 
has the conversation continued, but oth-
er players have also joined them move-
ment. If we fail to legitimize nonviolent 
protests, we only leave violent protests 
as an answer to injustice.
Steelers fans are so upset about the 
protests that they are burning jerseys 
and cancelling season tickets, but no 
one had such a violent, negative reac-
tion when Ben Roethlisberger allegedly 
raped two women. In fact, he still re-
mains the team’s quarterback, 
and Steeler fans 
had no issue buying 
tickets to support him or the 
long list of other men accused for sexual 
and/or domestic assault. Steelers fans 
are just hiding behind the veil of “sup-
porting the military” to mask their true 
intention of silencing activists who want 
to bring an end to racial injustice.
In order to bring change and end 
racism, we need activists in the NFL to 
generate these conversations, even if 
they make us uncomfortable. Steelers 
fans who wish they could watch a game 
without “politics” need to acknowledge 
the privilege they have that racial issues 
are something they can turn on and off, 
because people who experience racism 
do not get that option: it’s something 
they have to deal with from the day they 
are born until the day they die.

Bills should be passed for impact, not to ful?ll promises
Apple’s Face ID paves way for police abuse and surveillance
Anna Li/Staff Artist

It was less than two weeks ago 
when Senate Republicans an-
nounced another strategic push to 
“repeal and replace” the Affordable 
Care Act (ACA): a promise that 
they had made to their voters back 
in 2010, when the ACA was ?rst 
signed into law. “[The Graham-
Cassidy Bill] would repeal the pil-
lars of Obamacare and replace the 
failed law’s failed approach with 
a new one, allowing states and 
governors to actually implement 
better healthcare ideas by taking 
more decision-making power out 
of Washington,” said Senate Ma-
jority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-
KY), on the Senate ?oor.
Developed by Senator Lindsey 
Graham (R-SC) and Senator Bill 
Cassidy (R-LA), the “Graham-
Cassidy Bill” was to essentially 
apportion some federal funding 
allocated under the ACA to 
states in the form of federal 
block grants, giving states more 
?exibility and discretion to use 
healthcare funds. Two main 
problems threatened the success 
of the bill, however: the Sept. 30 
deadline and the need for at least 
50 votes from the chamber.
Last Tuesday, Sept. 26, less 
than 24 hours after Senator Susan 
Collins (R-ME) declared her op-
position, the Graham-Cassidy Bill 
was announced dead, not even 
putting the legislation up for a vote 
on the ?oor. “We’re coming back to 
this after taxes,” said Graham. “I 
believe this is the most important 
thing I can ever do for the country 
— working with my colleagues — 
is not to just repeal Obamacare but 
to replace it with a system closer 
to where you live, controlled by 
people you can vote for.”
In addition to Collins, Senator 
John McCain (R-AZ) and Senator 
Lisa Murkowski (R-AK) were re-
sponsible for the Republican lead-
ership’s ?nal decision to scrap the 
bill — with three Republicans op-
posing the proposal, the leader-
ship had no con?dence to put the 
bill up for a vote. “I cannot in good 
conscience vote for the Graham-
Cassidy proposal,” said McCain in 
a statement on Sept. 22. “I believe 
we can do better working together, 
Republicans and Democrats, and 
have not yet really tried.”
McCain has referenced to 
something very important 
here: bipartisanship. 
While it has been a 
common phenomenon 
to vote along party lines 
when it comes to issues like 
healthcare, McCain — who now 
seems to be playing the role of the 
moderate, pragmatic conservative 
— has shown us that he cares more 
about the content and impact of 
the legislation than the passage of 
the bill itself.
Regardless, President Donald 
Trump expressed his discontent for 
these Senators. “We were very dis-
appointed by a couple of Senators, 
Republican Senators I must say,” 
he said. “At some point there will 
be a repeal and replace, but we will 
see whether that point will be now 
or shortly thereafter. But, we are 
disappointed at certain so-called 
Republicans.”
Democrats, on the other hand, 
celebrated. “From one end of 
America to the other, the Graham-
Cassidy bill would have been a 
health-care disaster,” commented 
Senate Minority Leader Chuck 
Schumer (D-NY). “Our colleagues 
had no choice in the face of oppo-
sition from one end of the land to 
the other.”
This, in fact, is far from the ?rst 
effort by Republicans to repeal the 
ACA. From the American Health 
Care Act to the Better Health 
Care Reconciliation Act to the 
Obamacare Repeal Reconciliation 
Act to the numerous proposals 
drafted by individual Senators, 
Republicans in Congress have re-
peatedly pursued a replacement 
for the ACA in the past few years. 
As a matter of fact, the ACA is, in-
deed, in need of serious reform. 
According to The New York Times, 
insurance premiums are set to rise 
in 2018 due to insurers “citing the 
Trump administration’s hostile 
policy messages as a 
substantial reason for 
higher prices.” So, the 
question is, why hasn’t 
Congress found a solu-
tion yet, seven years after 
the passage of the ACA?
“You know, I could have, may-
be, give you 10 reasons why this 
bill shouldn’t be considered,” 
stated Senator Chuck Grass-
ley (R-IA) in a phone call 
with reporters discussing 
the Graham-Cassidy pro-
posal. “But… Republicans 
campaigned on this so often 
that we have a responsibility to 
carry out what you said in the cam-
paign. That’s pretty much as much 
of a reason as the substance of the 
bill.”
Frankly, Grassley — though 
heavily criticized for the above 
statement — said it all. In too many 
situations, especially when deal-
ing with polarizing issues such as 
healthcare, the prevailing attitude 
of politicians — both left and right 
— is that they desperately need to 
get legislation passed regarding 
their campaign promises, regard-
less of the “substance of the bill.” 
Yes, it is important for representa-
tives to keep their word and ful?ll 
promises. However, shouldn’t we 
expect policymakers to be equally 
considerate of the quality and the 
impact that their bill will have on 
the American people?
Perhaps, this is the reason why 
Congress has yet to replace the 
ACA with a more sustainable so-
lution. When it comes to decisive 
issues like healthcare, a rushed 
bill simply won’t do. As such, the 
Congressional 
Budget Of-
?ce (CBO) has 
recently shed light on the 
lack of long-term thought put 
into many of the recent “replace 
and repeal” efforts, including the 
Graham-Cassidy proposal itself 
which was projected to leave mil-
lions more without comprehensive 
health insurance.
In this regard, we go back to 
what McCain mentioned: the 
most tenable and balanced solu-
tion requires bipartisan dialogue. 
This healthcare impasse is neither 
political sustainable nor economi-
cally viable. Voting across party 
lines and rushing bills through 
the Senate ?oor should no longer 
be condoned: we ought to expect 
higher standards of our represen-
tatives. Politicians, on both sides 
of the aisle, should stop treating 
policymaking as opportunities to 
add new items to their resume. In 
essence, Congress should never 
pass bills just because they were 
promised; Congress should pass 
bills because they can make a posi-
tive, lasting impact.

The Fifth Amendment has been 
rendered obsolete. Apple’s new 
Face ID is an example of human in-
genuity but one that raises a whole 
host of questions about our privacy 
and mass surveillance.
There are two main concerns 
legal and privacy experts have 
expressed with Face ID. The ?rst 
and foremost is exactly how much 
leeway law enforcement has in ac-
cessing the data on our phones. 
The second is whether Face ID 
could be a prelude to mass govern-
ment surveillance.
In 2014, the Supreme Court of 
the United States (SCOTUS) ruled 
in Riley v. California that it was il-
legal for law enforcement to search 
a cell phone without a warrant. 
Our right to be safe from unlaw-
ful search and seizures is protected 
under the Fourth Amendment. 
However, a warrant was issued to 
the Los Angeles Police Department 
(LAPD) in October, 2014 which es-
sentially allowed the LAPD to treat 
an arrested suspect’s biometric 
information as physical evidence 
and not testimonial evidence.
Even though this distinction 
is seemingly insigni?cant, one 
important legal precedent is that 
physical evidence is not protected 
under the Fifth Amendment. One’s 
biometric information is under the 
same category as DNA, which one 
can be compelled to give. Worse 
still, arrested suspects are legally 
required to provide ?ngerprints 
and mug shots, the very biomet-
rics used for Touch ID and Face 
ID. This dangerous precedent was 
further supported with an addi-
tional ruling by a Virginia circuit 
court judge in late 2014. Under the 
ruling, it was established that law 
enforcement cannot force anyone 
to give up their passcode as their 
passwords are protected under 
the Fifth Amendment; however, 
biometric info is not and suspects 
can be forced to provide their ?n-
gerprints for Touch ID.
According to Orin Kerr, a re-
search professor at George Wash-
ington University Law School and 
the Director of the Cybersecurity 
Law Initiative said, “From a legal 
perspective, I don’t see any differ-
ence.” Since there isn’t a de?nitive 
landmark case precedent set by 
the SCOTUS in terms of biometric 
information protection under the 
Fifth Amendment yet, Apple’s new 
Face ID de?nitely seems like trad-
ing more utility in exchange for 
less overall bene?t.
Face ID not only utilizes a two-
dimensional scan to unlock the 
iPhone but also makes a math-
ematical model of one’s face by 
projecting over 30,000 points on 
their face and recording 
a three-dimensional (3D) model. 
Another caveat adopted by Apple 
has been to ensure that Face ID 
only works if our eyes are open so 
that one can’t unlock your phone if 
you’re sleeping merely by holding it 
up to your face.
Yet there isn’t a mechanism 
to detect micro-expressions in 
Face ID that is capable of detect-
ing whether you’re under duress 
and someone is forcing you to un-
lock your phone. Therefore, law 
enforcement or anyone else can 
simply hold up the iPhone X to our 
faces to unlock them.
The one coup there is in 
terms of protecting oneself from 
unlawful search and seizure of 
one’s personal data is a nifty 
feature Apple has introduced in 
iOS 11. If you press the power 
button on your phone ?ve times, 
that will disable Touch ID and 
Face ID, requiring your passcode 
to enable them again. Or, one can 
simply power off their phone, and 
on restarting, your passcode is 
required to re-enable Touch ID.
Another concern industry ex-
perts have professed focuses on 
how secure Face ID is going to be. 
For instance, Samsung’s “extreme-
ly secure” widely touted facial rec-
ognition unlock system in the ?ag-
ship Galaxy S8 was easily fooled 
by a mere picture. Even though 
this will not be the case with Face 
ID due to the 3D facial models 
iPhones will store, there are cer-
tainly other ways Face ID could 
be spoofed. Apple has acknowl-
edged that twins can unlock 
phones and that Face ID won’t 
work perfectly for children 13 
or younger “because their dis-
tinct facial features may not 
have fully developed.”
This concern has 
spread to the ?-
nancial market. Af-
ter all, many banks 
and retailers were only convinced 
to accept Apple Pay after they saw 
how secure Touch ID was. Since we 
don’t yet know how secure Face ID 
is, Apple’s decision to move Apple 
Pay from Touch ID to Face ID will 
remain up for debate.
After Apple unveiled Face ID, 
U.S. Senator Al Franken (D-MN), 
Chairman of the Senate Judiciary 
Sub-Committee on Privacy, Tech-
nology and the Law sent a public 
letter to Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, 
and outlined questions he had 
about Face ID technology and how 
Apple’s hopes to protect individual 
consumer data, speci?cally one’s 
“faceprint.” If someone’s password 
is compromised, they can simply 
change it. On the other hand, if 
someone’s faceprint is stolen, they 
can’t change their faces.
Another concern Franken had 
was about the database Face ID 
was developed with. Phil Schiller, 
Apple’s Senior Vice-President of 
Worldwide Marketing, claimed 
that Face ID had been ?ne-tuned 
using over a billion images of faces. 
Senator Franken is understandably 
curious how Apple was able to 
obtain access to or able to develop 
this database and whether the 
database had suf?cient samples 
from a plethora of ethnicities, 
genders, and ages.
Franken has requested Apple 
to make their strategies for pro-
tecting their customer’s biometric 
data public and to make the pro-
cess more transparent. In addition, 
he is curious as to how Apple will 
respond if asked to divulge biomet-
ric data when faced with a war-
rant, especially when Apple claims 
that this biometric data isn’t being 
stored in the cloud or on Apple 
servers.
Apple has attempted to stave 
off any claims of Face ID being 
utilized as a tool for mass surveil-
lance or the claim that Apple is 
creating a massive database of 
facial scans which it can then sell 
to third parties or one the govern-
ment can commandeer the use of 
by heavily promoting their secure 
enclave. Schiller assured the audi-
ence when introducing Face ID on 
the iPhone X, that unlike Samsung, 
all iPhones with Face ID will store 
all the secure data locally, in a se-
cure enclave built into the phone 
itself, encrypted to such a degree 
that Apple itself does not possess 
the key to decrypt it.
Let’s give Apple the bene?t of 
the doubt and assume that their 
enclaves are indeed secure and 
hack-proof. That still doesn’t pro-
tect the average consumer from the 
biggest customer of their personal 
data — the government. Recently, 
Apple had a huge public disagree-
ment with the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation (FBI) over providing 
the law enforcement agency with 
blanket access to all Apple devices. 
Apple refused.
The only reason Apple prevailed 
over the FBI, however, is because 
they challenged the FBI in the 
courts and won. That will not al-
ways be the case. It is inevitable the 
government will at least attempt to 
gain access to the huge database of 
biometric data Apple has the poten-
tial to retrieve from their iPhones. 
Currently, Facebook is the world 
leader in facial recognition; how-
ever, Facebook only controls the 
software. Apple has uni?ed both 
the hardware and software for fa-
cial recognition in the world’s most 
popular and ubiquitous tech.
Another concern is that cer-
tain applications will be granted 
access to one’s biometric informa-
tion and many third-party applica-
tions already do so for Touch ID. 
Apple now has the additional re-
sponsibility of ensuring that even 
though the aforementioned third-
party developers can access the 
biometric info stored in the secure 
enclave, they can’t store or further 
distribute it.
In fact, Edward Snowden 
tweeted that, while it’s good 
Apple has a “panic disable,” Face 
ID normalizes facial scanning and 
makes it mainstream, which has an 
extremely high potential for abuse 
and misuse.
A database of biometric info 
storing even the most basic infor-
mation has the potential for strang-
ers and law enforcement to identi-
fy someone with a simple picture. 
In addition, facial recognition can 
be utilized to track someone in real 
time, a prelude to George Orwell’s 
“Big Brother.”
As revealed by Snowden, under 
the Foreign Intelligence Surveil-
lance Act (FISA) and the therein 
established FISA courts, the gov-
ernment can issue as many secret 
warrants as it deems ?t. This is 
especially worrisome as this tactic 
has already been tried with Yahoo 
to order them to make a program to 
scan all their emails for keywords 
speci?ed by the government.
Even if Apple appeals any order 
by the government to create a da-
tabase of their customer’s biomet-
ric data, there’s always the chance 
that SCOTUS or the FISA courts 
will simply side with the govern-
ment in the interest of national 
security. Certainly, national secu-
rity is an important concern for the 
government, however, that does 
not mean that that certain govern-
ment agencies should have blanket 
access to all consumer data.
Big Brother is watching.

The poison dart frogs of 
Central and South America 
are some of the world’s 
deadliest creatures. The 
largest poison dart frogs are 
the length of a paper clip 
(the smallest are barely half 
an inch), yet the poison in 
their tiny bodies is 200 times 
stronger than morphine, 
and the amount of toxin in 
a single frog can kill a water 
buffalo. so why doesn’t it kill 
the frog?
Frogs acquire the posion 
throught their diet of mites 
and ants; they don’t make 
the poison themselves. They  
use this poison to paralyze 
their attackers, which is of-
ten done in nature by attck-
ing the nervous system.
Thus, frogs resist the ac-
tion of the toxins by develop-
ing mechanisms to not allow 
the toxins to bind with the 
crucial protein whose func-
tion the toxins would dis-
rupt or modify.
The toxin found in many 
poisonous frogs is a neu-
rotoxin called epibatidine. 
Chemically, it resembles the 
compound acetylcholine, 
which facilitates communi-
cation between nerve cells. 
Because of their molecular 
similarities, epibatidine and 
acetylcholine bind to nerve 
receptors in the same spot. 
When a predator eats 
a poisonous frog, the 
epibatidine binds to the 
predator’s nerve receptors, 
replacing acetylcholine. 
This disrupts crucial nerve 
functions, paralyzing the 
predator.
To ?nd out why the frogs 
are immune to epibatidine, 
University of Texas biolo-
gist Rebecca Tarvin and 
her colleagues studied the 
frogs’ acetylcholine recep-
tors. Tarvin’s team found 
that the receptors had mu-
tated slightly: they accepted 
acetylcholine as usual, but 
the mutated shape no lon-
ger allowed epibatidine to 
bind. By ensuring that only 
acetylcholine can enter the 
receptors, the mutation pro-
tects the frogs from their 
own poison.
The mutation’s precision 
and speci?city amazed the 
biologists who discovered 
it. “It almost seems unlikely 
that something like that 
would evolve,” says Tarvin.
Yet, it did evolve — and 
not just once,

Statistics don’t represent implicit gender bias in STEM
SARAH KIM
Junior Staffwriter
There are two assump-
tions about science, tech-
nology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) that 
are so reinforced by society 
that they are now almost ac-
cepted as truths. The ?rst is 
that STEM is probably the 
most explicitly gender-divid-
ed area of academics, since 
men outnumber women by 
so much. The second is that 
this feeds a vicious cycle 
of more women being un-
willing to join STEM ?elds 
simply because they are per-
ceived as minorities in those 
areas. But, regardless of 
how socially accepted these 
assumptions are, to what 
extent are they true? If true, 
where do these so-called 
“facts” come from?
The very ?rst step is to 
examine the reality of STEM 
?elds. Contrary to what 
most people consider to be 
true, men do not outnumber 
women in all STEM ?elds. 
Studies from the 
National Science Founda-
tion show that for the past 
two decades, women in the 
biosciences, social sciences, 
and mathematics received 
more than 50 percent of the 
bachelor’s degrees, meaning 
they cannot be considered 
minorities in those areas 
anymore. The biggest dif-
ferences in the number of 
bachelor’s degrees earned 
between men and women in 
computer science and engi-
neering, two ?elds still con-
sidered to be primarily stud-
ied by men. However, the 
gender gap becomes much 
more evident after the un-
dergraduate level of studies. 
Women have been earning 
fewer than 30 percent of the 
Ph.D. degrees in computer 
science, engineering, math-
ematics, and the physical 
sciences since 1991. 
The same pattern appears 
in the workforce. Although 
women account for half of 
the workforce in the United 
States, fewer than 25 per-
cent of the STEM industry is 
occupied by women, accord-
ing to the US government’s 
Economic and Statistics 
Administration. This indi-
cates that even women with 
STEM degrees are relatively 
less likely to pursue STEM 
career paths than their male 
counterparts. 
So, the common belief 
that the gender discrimina-
tion in STEM is explicit and 
can easily be represented by 
statistics is wrong. Gender 
differences are rather more 
implicit, as it is being per-
petuated by a cycle that is 
very dif?cult to uproot.
Then where does the cy-
cle even begin? From when 
do women start facing barri-
ers from following STEM ca-
reer paths relative to men?
Sharon Traweek, associ-
ate professor in the Depart-
ment of Gender Studies at 
the University of California, 
Los Angeles, spent years 
“observing physicists, at-
tending research meetings, 
interviewing faculty, staff, 
students, and more,” and 
found a community of peo-
ple who claim to have “no 
culture.” However, she no-
ticed that the same people 
were simultaneously rein-
forcing a culture of seeing 
physics as empty of emotion 
and void of human in?uence 
— in other words, cold and 
rational. Thus, these char-
acteristics have become the 
stereotypes of what a scien-
tist looks like. In a society 
where implicit gender ste-
reotypes are still somewhat 
prevalent, such descriptions 
of the ideal “scientist” (re-
gardless of whether they are 
true) may present barriers 
for women’s participation in 
STEM. Another particularly 
recent issue that has come up 
regarding women in STEM 
is the potential grading bias 
that exists even at the high 
school level. An analysis of 
eight years of data shows 
that there were consistent 
gaps in the performance of 
male and female students 
solving questions regarding 
projectile motion: the mo-
tion of an object subject only 
to the force of gravity. 
Though we do not know 
exactly what we can credit 
the relatively large perfor-
mance gaps (25 to 30 per-
cent difference) to, we need 
to ask ourselves if certain 
topics, especially the funda-
mental ones like projectile 
motion, present disadvan-
tages to certain genders. 
When this is combined 
with the fact that, as proven 
through studies performed 
in several German-speaking 
countries, inexperienced 
physics teachers tend to give 
better grades to male stu-
dents than female students 
we can see the disadvan-
tages women face from the 
early stages of their involve-
ment in STEM.
Much has been done to 
get rid of this gender bias. 
The Massachusetts Institute 
of Technology, perhaps the 
hub of development in en-
gineering and the sciences, 
specially offers programs 
like the Women’s Technol-
ogy Program to “spark high 
school girls’ interest in the 
future study of engineering 
and computer science,” the 
two areas where the number 
of females is most de?cient. 
Even on our own campus, 
there are clubs like Women 
in Science that encourage 
women to be more active 
participants in STEM ac-
tivities. With such programs 
providing sparks to push 
girls to study the sciences, 
perhaps, in a future not too 
far from our time, issues 
about women being under-
represented in STEM will be 
long-disputed and outdated. 
But for now, the fact that 
society needs to provide 
special programs dedicated 
to women hoping to pursue 
careers in STEM should keep 
us thinking. 
Why don’t poison dart frogs poison themselves? 
HOW STUFF WORKS

The poison dart frog, characterized by its brightly colored exterior, has enough toxin in its body to kill a water buffalo. The poison contained in 
its body doesn’t affect it because it has mutated acetylcholine receptors that don’t bind to the paralysing neurotoxin—epibatidine.

2011 tsunami carried new aquatic species to the U.S.
In 2011, Japan was struck 
by a devastating tsunami 
triggered by a 9.0 magnitude 
earthquake that occurred 
only a short while before the 
tsunami. The 125 foot tall 
wave swept many objects, 
debris into the ocean. 
Clinging to the debris 
was coastal and aquatic life 
off the coast of Japan, which 
?oated all the way to the 
coast of the U.S. and Hawaii. 
The study of these species 
new to the U.S. Coast started 
in 2012 and ended recent-
ly. Even as the study was 
concluded, scientists were 
counting new species into 
the 289 discovered ones.
Scientists found types of 
mollusks such as mussels, 
and forms of sea-anemone 
and jelly?sh on the coast. 
These species typically 
wouldn’t be expected to ven-
ture on or survive a trans-
atlantic trip.
In an article in Science 
Daily, Greg Ruiz, a co-author 
and marine biologist at the 
Smithsonian Environmental 
Research Center explains, 
“I didn’t think that most 
of these coastal organisms 
could survive at sea for long 
periods of time… But in 
many ways they just haven’t 
had much opportunity in the 
past. Now, plastic can com-
bine with tsunami and storm 
events to create that oppor-
tunity on a large scale.”

Bubbling of ice could explain the beginning of life on Earth
Scientists at the Hokkaido 
University in Sapporo, Japan 
studied the effects of radia-
tion and temperature on a 
mixture of water, ammonia 
and methanol. This combina-
tion of compounds is typically 
found in birthplaces of stars 
— comets and interstellar 
clouds. 
They experimented at the 
temperatures at which ice 
forms, negative 263 degrees 
Celsius and negative 258 
degrees Celsius, and then 
irradiated the ice to create 
conditions closest to that of a 
young star. 
From negative 208 to 
negative 123 degrees Celsius, 
they found that ice under-
goes bubbling, similar to that 
of champagne and carbon 
dioxide, only with hydrogen 
whose levels had increased 
as the bubbling occurred. The 
amount of ammonia, metha-
nol and radiation affected the 
amount of bubbling. 
Also, from about nega-
tive 185 degrees Celsius and 
negative 161 degrees Celsius, 
the ice seemed to ?ow like re-
frigerated honey. After both 
of these effects, it has become 
possible to explain chemical 
reactivity at very low temper-
atures and hence, it has be-
come possible to explain the 
formation of molecules that 
are essential to life, which 
could potentially be crucial to 
understanding how life as we 
know it, started on Earth.

SpaceX presents mega-rockets for point-to-point travel on Earth
At the International 
Astronautical Congress (IAC) 
in Adelaide, Australia, on 
Sept. 28, Elon Musk, entrepre-
neur, business giant, inventor 
and visionary, proposed us-
ing the BFR for point-to-point 
travel on Earth, at the price of 
an economy air-line ticket. 
The BFR is a type of rocket 
that would, in addition to 
doing all the work that cur-
rent SpaceX vehicles do and 
interplanetary travel, would 
make what people consider to 
be long-distance journeys on 
Earth to be much shorter. The 
advertisement video for the 
BFR states that the London 
to New York journey which is 
typically eight to nine hours 
long would take only 29 min-
utes. These ships are insanely 
fast, ?ying at 18,000 miles per 
hour. From the time that the 
BFR was ?rst pitched, it has 
grown much smaller in size 
at 106 meters in length and 9 
meters wide. Though that still 
seems to be large, Musk says 
that, with the second presen-
tation, it has become more 
cost-effective. 
He explains, according to 
an article on the BBC web-
site, that cost-effectiveness 
was increased by focusing on 
a single system that could ful-
?ll all the different needs of 
the company. In an article on 
Verge, he hopes to begin pro-
duction on these rockets in six 
to nine months.

but at least three sepa-
rate times on the poisonous 
frog family’s genetic tree. 
“This is beautiful... a very 
rare insight into how evolu-
tion works and how neuro-
biology works,” said venom 
specialist Zoltan Takacs.
Calling this ?nding 
“very rare” isn’t an over-
statement. Researchers 
know that they obtain the 
toxin from their diet, but 
its speci?c mechanisms are 
not known. Biologists have 
found over 800 poisons in 
various species of frogs, but 
only a few dozen are un-
derstood. “Tracking down 
these toxins’ sources and 
learning more about how 
animals evolved resistance 
also offers insights that 
could hit close to home,” 
says Butch Brodie III, a bi-
ologist from the University 
of Virginia who reviewed 
Tarvin’s research.
Venomous animals 
are an untapped source 
of potential in many 
bio-chemical applica-
tions. While, many of 
these animals, such as 
the King Cobra,  stingrays 
and even a caterpillar that 
causes severe internal 
haemoragging are deadly, 
they could have the answer 
to curing Lyme disease, dia-
betes and Alzhemier’s, ac-
cording to an article in the 
National Geographic.
The toxins that are 
understood are rapidly 
?nding applications out-
side the rainforest. Bio-
medical researchers are 
working on developing epi-
batidine into a painkiller 
similar to morphine, but 
without the dangerous side 
effects. 
Many medical contri-
butions and other applica-
tions have arisen simply 
from studying the frogs in 
order to understand them 
— how their bodies func-
tion, how they’ve evolved, 
and how they ?t into their 
ecosystem. The tiny, color-
ful frogs are worth study-
ing not just because they 
might bene?t humans, but 
because they are amaz-
ing creatures in their own 
MIT’s ‘origami’ robots can switch exoskeletons and tasks quickly
NAVIYA SINGLA
SciTech Editor
Researchers at MIT’s 
Computer Science and 
Arti?cial Intelligence 
Laboratory (CSAIL) re-
cently published a study 
in Science Robotics that 
explains “origami robots” 
that fold in-and-out of dif-
ferent exoskeletons that 
help them navigate over 
various types of surfaces 
and perform different 
types of motion. The ro-
bot that they describe can 
“change” into four differ-
ent skins — a glider that 
allows to “?y”, a wheel 
that it can use to roll for 
faster motion, a walker, 
and a boat-like skin that 
allows it to sail.
In an article in Science 
Daily, Daniela Rus — a ro-
botics researcher at MIT 
and one of the co-authors 
of the study, says “It’s al-
most like putting clothes 
on the robot to give it dif-
ferent kinds of powers,” 
Conventional robots 
operate with speci?c phys-
ical parts that perform a 
single function. This spe-
cialization of components 
leads to bulky, non-porta-
ble and often, expensive 
products. 
However, these robots 
use several self-foldable 
skins and the same mech-
anism to control them 
all. As quoted in a press 
release, Rus says, “If we 
want robots to help us do 
things, it’s not very ef?-
cient to have a different 
one for each task... With 
this metamorphosis-in-
spired approach, we can 
extend the capabilities of 
a single robot by giving 
it different ‘accessories’ 
to use in different situa-
tions.”
At a very basic level, 
these robots are com-
posed of a metallic core 
that is made of magnetic 
coils of wire called sole-
noids, in a cube that is 
only a few millimeters in 
length. These solenoids 
are used to control these 
tiny machines. 
The core is then 
wrapped in origami 
sheets, that are basically 
made of heat-shrinking 
material placed between 
two layers of polyester. 
The heat-sensitive mate-
rial in between the polyes-
ter sheets is exposed along 
the fold-lines. Thus, when 
this robot was placed on a 
heating pad at a tempera-
ture of 65 degrees Celsius, 
the heat-shrinking 
material behaves accord-
ing to its folds and folds 
into the shape of a skin; 
it walks, glides, rolls, or 
sails, depending on what 
skin it has on.
Researchers then com-
bined these Walk-bots, 
Wheel-bots, Boat-bots, 
or Glider-bots into bigger 
bots, with more sophisti-
cated exoskeletons using 
water-soluble claps that 
the bots could use to move 
through or discard the 
exoskeletons.
The origami robots 
have a lot of potential due 
to their adaptable nature. 
Be it minimally invasive 
surgeries, space travel, 
natural disaster response,  
or deep-sea mining opera-
tions these robots open up 
opportunities for a revo-
lution in human-robot 
partnerships.

The Carnegie Mellon 
football team traveled to 
Bethany, WV, on Saturday 
to play the Bison and came 
away with a 45–14 victory 
in a Presidents’ Athletic 
Conference (PAC) contest. 
Carnegie Mellon improves 
to 5–0 over and 3–0 in the 
PAC while Bethany is now 
0–5, 0–3. The Tartans’ 5–0 
start to the season marks its 
best since 2006 and is just 
the 12th time in program 
history a team has started 
the season with ?ve straight 
wins.
Senior wide receiver 
John Prather tied the school 
record for most receptions 
in a game, ?nishing with 10 
catches for 122 yards and 
added a career-best four 
touchdowns, all in the ?rst 
half. This marked Prather’s 
eighth 100-yard career 
game and third this season. 
Junior quarterback Alex 
Cline threw for a career-best 
?ve touchdowns and passed 
for 127 yards on 11-of-22.
Senior Stanley Bikulege 
moved into third on the 
school’s all-time tackle list 
after totaling ?ve tackles. He 
now has 240 tackles for his 
career. The defense was led 
by junior cornerback Ethan 
Anderson with nine tackles, 
?ve solo. Senior linebacker 
Quentin Wolfe recorded 
eight tackles including ?ve 
solo, and ?rst-year safety 
Chandler Stacy ended with 
seven tackles, four solo. The 
?rst-year also added a 40-
yard interception return for 
a touchdown early in the 
fourth quarter.
Bethany outgained 
the Tartans 296–238, but 
Carnegie Mellon capitalized 
on the Bison’s three turn-
overs and 20 penalties for 
205 yards. The Tartans  were 
also perfect from inside the 
red zone, converting all ?ve 
opportunities.
Cline tossed ?ve ?rst-half 
touchdowns, four of them 
going to Prather. The tan-
dem started the game’s scor-
ing with a 28-yard strike at 
the nine minute mark of the 
?rst quarter. Four minutes 
later, the Tartans made the 
score 10–0 on a 33-yard ?eld 
goal by senior punter and 
kicker Tyler Kohman.
On the ?rst play of 
the second quarter, Cline 
hooked up with senior wide 
receiver Tommy Mans?eld 
on a ?ve-yard touchdown 
reception, which made 
the score 17–0. The seven-
play, 37-yard scoring drive 
started following a fumble 
recovery by senior defensive 
lineman Neal Baranosky 
which was forced on a sack 
by Anderson and sophomore 
Michael Lohmeier.
Carnegie Mellon senior 
linebacker Sean Graff inter-
cepted the ball on the ?rst 
play of the Bison’s ensu-
ing possession which led to 
Cline and Prather’s second 
scoring connection of the 
game, 9-yard strike to make 
the score 24-0. The two 
struck again for scores from 
14 yards and 5 yards out 
before the end of the half, 
as the Tartans went into the 
half with a 38-0 lead.
Bethany held the Tartans 
to a three-and-out on the 
opening possession of 
the second half and then 
marched 80 yards on six 
plays for its ?rst score of the 
game. Two minutes into the 
fourth quarter Stacy’s in-
terception return made the 
score 45–7 before Bethany’s 
backup quarterback threw a 
20-yard touchdown for the 
?nal score of the game.
Carnegie Mellon will 
return to Gesling Stadium 
on Saturday, Oct. 7 to face 
17th-ranked Washington & 
Jefferson College.
Volleyball
The 10th-ranked 
Carnegie Mellon volleyball 
team opened University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
play with a mark of 1–1 on 
Saturday at Case Western 
Reserve University. The 
Tartans are now 17–1. The 
Tartans opened the UAA 
Round Robin with a 3–1 
(26–24, 25–19, 11–25, 
25–16) setback to the host 
Spartans before topping 
New York University 3–1 
(25–18, 23–25, 25–19, 25–
23).
Against Case Western 
Reserve, four Tartans tabbed 
double digit kills with junior 
Lauren Mueller leading the 
way with 20. Senior Eliza 
Donohue totaled 13, senior 
Heather Holton had 12, and 
junior Sarah Jurgens ended 
with 10. Sophomore Maia 
So-Holloway tallied 32 as-
sist while junior Amanda 
Thiele had 23.
Defensively, sophomore 
Kayla Yew recorded 27 digs 
and Mueller and junior 
Sydney Bauer had 19 and 
12, respectively.
In the win over NYU, 
Mueller again led the team 
with 20 kills. Donohue and 
Jurgens again also totaled 
double digit in kills with 11 
and 10. So-Holloway and 
Thiele each had 23 assists 
apiece. So-Holloway and 
Yew recorded three service 
aces while Yew led the de-
fense with 35 digs.

Women’s Tennis
Carnegie Mellon wom-
en’s tennis was well rep-
resented on the ?nal day 
of competition of the ITA 
Southeast Regional Champi-
onships, owning the doubles 
?nal with two players com-

Strome came through with a 
10–8 win.
In singles action, ?rst-
year Hannah Rosen?eld 
was ousted from the tour-
nament in the semi?nals 
after a hard-fought two-set

Charlotte Simpson claimed 
individual medalist honors 
on Monday afternoon. The 
two-day event was hosted at

Women’s soccer ready as UAA competition beginsMen’s soccer opens UAA play with win against NYU
KATE LISTON
Junior Staffwriter
As junior defender Emily 
Tolmer sprinted down the 
soccer ?eld after a day of 
classes, she realized her ex-
haustion. After the ordeal, 
she sat on the benches and 
looked over at her similarly 
exhausted teammates and 
knew they were the reason 
she pushed herself so hard. 
The new ?tness standards 
that the women’s soccer 
team implemented this fall 
force players to train harder 
— both mentally and physi-
cally — in order to make the 
team.
“This year, there was 
more of a mindset that 
everyone was to earn their 
position on the ?eld. It 
wasn’t based off of any of 
your past achievements or 
anything that you’ve done; 
it was basically a clean slate 
where you had to come in 
and work to earn your posi-
tion,” said Tolmer.
The new ?tness stan-
dards made training more 
competitive this year. 
The standards consisted 
of shorter times for tra-
ditional training require-
ments, including the beep 
test, full-?eld sprints, long 
sprints, and shuttle sprints. 
The challenge of these new 
standards forced players to 
overcome both physical and 
mental barriers and helped 
foster the respect they had 
for each other.
“I think having respect 
for each other is just trust-
ing different players on 
the ?eld and every team-
mate. I know in the past our 
team has dealt with a lot 
of injuries or just personal 
change on the ?eld and I 
think that everyone is work-
ing so hard [that] it makes 
you comfortable playing on 
the team and knowing that 
anyone who steps on the 
?eld has earned their posi-
tion on the team. We de-
manded so much more from 
each other than in years 
past,” said Tolmer.
While, of course, every 
team’s goal is to win na-
tionals, the women’s soc-
cer team believes that their 
new training standards will 
help them to accomplish 
this goal. In order to make 
it to nationals, the team has 
to ?rst either win their con-
ference or, when compared 
to other teams, perform 
well based on their record, 
schedule, and teams played. 
If these requirements are 
met, the team is able to play 
in the NCAA tournament 
and has the opportunity to 
make it to the ?nal four.
“The goal is to win a na-
tional championship. This 
season [when] we were 
expected to come in a lot 
more ?t than… in the past, 
we could immediately start 
training at our top speed and 
level, which has led into our 
game speed,” said ?rst-year 
mid?elder and defender 
Hannah Anderson.
While the team has 
found the new standards to 
be helpful in preparing for 
both their games and the 
championship, they believe 
that ?tness is only one of 
many aspects players need 
to grow.
“We’re holding each oth-
er accountable to a higher 
level of play in all aspects: 
?tness is just one. We always 
say we’re not a track team, 
we’re a soccer team that 
just happens to work really 
hard on ?tness because that 
enables us to focus more on 
our play,” said Tolmer.
This mentality was im-
portant to keep in mind as 
the team opened University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
play against New York 
University on Saturday. The 
Tartans earned a 1–0 vic-
tory against the Violets.
Senior forward Haili 
Adams put in the game 
winner and her seventh 
goal of the year in the third 
minute. Senior defender 
Katie Strycharz played a 
ball along the sideline to 
sophomore forward Ryan 
Casey who raced down to 
the goal line. Adams was 
there to loft a shot over the 
keeper to the far post.
First-year goalkeeper 
Carolyn Botz was credited 
with the win and shutout 
after making two saves.
The women’s soccer 
team remains con?dent in 
their ability to make it to the 
?nal four. Until then, the 
team is taking this season 
weekend by weekend but 
keeping the championship 
in the back of their minds.

The 12th-ranked 
men’s soccer team opened 
up University Athletic 
Association (UAA) play 
against New York University 
(NYU) on Saturday. The 
Tartans won 3–1, advancing 
to 7–1–1 for the year (1–0 in 
the UAA) while the Violets 
move to 5–2–1.
Both sides started the 
game aggressively, with 
NYU taking their ?rst 
shot within the ?rst min-
ute of play. In the third 
minute, junior forward 
Anthony Guili attempted 
a shot blocked by NYU’s 
goalkeeper. On the re-
bound, junior mid?elder 
Zack Masciopinto success-
fully scored his ?fth goal of 
the season on a header to 
give the Tartans the early 
1–0 advantage. Shot at-
tempts stopped until the 
29th minute after an NYU 
shot went wide. In the 32nd 
minute, junior mid?elder 
Jamie Wheaton’s shot was 
blocked by the goalkeeper. 
In the 34th minute, 
sophomore mid?elder Elliot 
Cohen also made a shot that 
was saved by the oppos-
ing goalkeeper. No further 
shots were attempted in the 
half.
In the second half, the 
Tartans regained the of-
fensive. In the 51st minute, 
a corner kick from Guili 
was de?ected by junior 
defender Greg Bellwoar 
into the net for his second 
goal of the season, put-
ting the Tartans up 2–0. In 
response, NYU proceeded 
to make a goal in the 56th 
minute, cutting the Tartan 
lead to 2–1. The Tartans 
then went back to pressur-
ing NYU’s defense, with 
Masciopinto attempting a 
shot that hit the post and 
sophomore mid?elder Jack 
Painter following up on a 
shot that had to be saved by 
the goalkeeper. In the 66th 
minute, Masciopinto man-
aged to get the ball around 
the goalkeeper to make his 
sixth goal of the season, 
putting the Tartans up 3–1. 
The Tartans continued to 
keep up the pressure with 
Masciopinto attempting 
another header off a corner 
kick in the 73rd minute and 
Wheaton having an attempt 
go wide in the 74th min-
ute. Senior forward Ryan 
Stinebaugh’s header shot in 
the 81st minute missed, as 
did sophomore mid?elder 
Cooper Tubiana’s header 
shot in the 83rd minute. 
NYU attempted to rally for 
a comeback, shooting in the 
87th, 88th, and 89th min-
utes. The ?rst went wide, 
the second was saved by 
junior goalkeeper Alec Lam, 
and the ?nal one went high.
The Tartans will next 
host Penn State Behrend on 
Tuesday, Oct. 3 at 7 p.m.

Fantasy football: turmoil matches eventful realityVillanueva shows backlash over NFL anthem protests
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
The third week of the 
football season was quite 
eventful — both in real life, 
and in The Tartan’s fantasy 
football league. With some 
stunning performances 
from unexpected players, 
and several disappoint-
ments, we had both a blow-
out and a nail-biter. My 
team still has not managed 
to win a single game, liv-
ing up to its name. I started 
the season con?dent, but 
now I’m contemplating if 
I should make it my goal 
to lose every single game 
in attempt to keep my dig-
nity. Here are the highs and 
lows of this week of fantasy 
football.
Team Andah over Third-
String Team 182.7–106.4
This week I faced off 
against staffwriter Josh 
Andah’s team, getting 
handed not only my third 
consecutive loss, but eas-
ily the worst one, getting 
blown out by a whopping 
76.3 points. Maybe I need 
to start using Andah’s strat-
egy, which is no strategy 
at all. Andah’s hands-off 
approach has proven effec-
tive. After lackluster per-
formances last week from 
Seattle Seahawks quarter-
back Russell Wilson and 
Chicago Bears running back 
Jordan Howard, Andah’s 
commitment to them payed 
off, giving him 65.1 points 
between just the two of 
them. All of his roster per-
formed well, earning him 
the most points by any team 
so far this season.
On the ?ip side, my team 
was hindered by an under-
whelming week from many 
of my key players, including 
Atlanta Falcons quarterback 
Matt Ryan, Kansas City 
Chiefs tight end Travis 
Kelce, who carried my team 
last week, and Oakland 
Raiders wide receiver Amari 
Cooper, who has failed to 
live up to my expectations. 
But worst of all was a detri-
mental negative six points 
from the Baltimore Ravens 
defense, my hometown 
team. The blowout wasn’t 
as bad as it could have been 
with breakout weeks from 
wide receivers A.J. Green of 
the Cincinnati Bengals and 
Brandin Cooks of the New 
England Patriots. I suppose 
there’s always next week.
Yes We Cam over Justin 
Tucker Must (not) Die 
125.9–124.8
Getting her third vic-
tory to stay undefeated and 
at the top of the standings, 
Editor-in-Chief India Price 
won by 1.1 points, and need-
ed fantastic performances 
across the board to pull 
past Contributing Editor 
Lula Beresford’s team. New 
York Giants star wide re-
ceiver Odell Beckham Jr. 
had his ?rst great game 
of the season, with nine 
receptions, 79 yards, and 
two touchdowns, adding 
28.9 points to Price’s total 
score. Despite throwing two 
interceptions, Giants quar-
terback Eli Manning still 
earned 22.6 points.
After losing in week one 
with the lowest league score, 
Beresford has become a real 
fantasy football threat, put-
ting up a ?ght against the 
reigning champion. Her 
team was bolstered from 
20+ point-performances 
from four players, including 
Green Bay Packers quarter-
back Aaron Rodgers with 
24.8 points. However, her 
titular player underper-
formed, with one sole point. 
Beresford’s team is a force 
to be reckoned with when 
the roster plays to expecta-
tions, and it’s de?nitely one 
to watch out for.
Easy Breesy over Drop it 
like it’s Crock 134.5–114.2
This week, Sports Editor 
Ian Tanaya triumphed over 
Publisher Jade Crockem 
with consistent scores from 
several players. In a smart 
strategy, Tanaya replaced 
his starting running back 
from last week, DeMarco 
Murray of the Tennessee 
Titans, who scored a measly 
3.8 points last week, with 
Chiefs rookie running back 
Kareem Hunt, who has been 
a breakout star in real life 
and in fantasy football. The 
only negative statistic in the 
box score was Raiders wide 
receiver Michael Crabtree 
in the ?ex position with 1.7 
points. Many of Tanaya’s 
bench players put up better 
numbers, and I expect a ros-
ter shuf?e next week.
Though this was the 
second loss in a row for 
Crockem, her team has 
some bright spots to give 
some hope for the rest of the 
season. Packers wide receiv-
er Jordy Nelson returned to 
form after his injury last 
week, scoring 23.2 points. 
Arizona Cardinals wide 
receiver Larry Fitzgerald 
had the team’s best perfor-
mance of the week with 13 
catches, 149 yards, and a 
touchdown, totaling 33.9 
points. If some of her other 
players, like Dallas Cowboys 
tight end Jason Witten and 
Miami Dolphins running 
back Jay Ajayi, can rebound 
next week, Crockem has 
a chance to salvage the 
season.
MEL KERBER
Junior Staffwriter
Alejandro Villanueva is 
many things to the people 
of Pittsburgh: starting left 
tackle for the Pittsburgh 
Steelers, a part-time gradu-
ate student at Carnegie 
Mellon’s Tepper School of 
Business, and most recently, 
the focal point of a media 
storm launched on Friday 
night by President Trump. 
Prior to the Pittsburgh 
Steelers game last Sunday, 
head coach Mike Tomlin 
released a statement con-
?rming that he and his 
players would remain in 
the locker room during the 
anthem after the National 
Football League (NFL) re-
leased a statement of unity 
and support. When it came 
time to start the anthem, 
the Steelers dutifully be-
gan to exit the ?eld — save 
for Villanueva. He was 
photographed standing at 
the front of the tunnel to 
the locker rooms, the only 
Steeler participating in the 
anthem.
NFL players kneeling 
during the anthem is com-
paratively old news, as Colin 
Kaepernick began kneel-
ing at the start of the 2016 
season to protest police 
brutality and racial injus-
tice. Various other players 
participated, but the focus 
remained on Kaepernick. 
Now out of the league, 
Kaepernick’s protests and 
motivations have fallen be-
hind the words of Trump, 
NFL owners, and sports re-
porters nationwide.
Within hours, Villanueva 
became a symbol against 
the protests, which were 
performed in some form at 
every single Sunday game. 
The Army veteran’s jersey 
swiftly became the highest 
selling jersey in the NFL. 
Yet in an interview after the 
game, Villanueva claimed 
he was following his team-
mates when he got stuck be-
hind other personnel on the 
?eld. Although his plan was 
to remain hidden in the tun-
nel, he found himself still 
on the ?eld as the anthem 
began, and chose to remain. 
Later, Steelers quarterback 
Ben Roethlisberger was 
quoted that he regretted the 
team’s decision to remain in 
the locker room.
On a weekend where the 
NFL tried to push unity, the 
tension between Steelers 
teammates re?ects the ten-
sion now brought between 
fans of the NFL. The protests 
were never about unity at 
the beginning, or the ?ag, or 
disrespecting the military. 
They were, and always have 
been, focused on the real is-
sues of racism in the United 
States. After the Steelers 
game, a ?re chief in Wash-
ington County, PA leveled 
a racial slur at Tomlin on 
Facebook, and people were 
reportedly covering Steelers 
?ags in swastikas. In the 
span of a weekend, profes-
sional football dramatically 
re?ected the state of race 
relations in America right 
in the faces of the general 
public. Outcries of keeping 
politics out of sports persist, 
as if including the anthem 
in and of itself is not a po-
litical statement. But sports 
fans were not prepared to 
face the harsh reality that 
came to light. By exercising 
their ?rst amendment right 
to free speech, the black 
athletes kneeling for the an-
them were defamed in the 
media by the President of 
the United States.
And yet the original 
focus has been lost. Post-
game interviews speak of 
protesting the anthem or 
protesting the ?ag, ignoring 
Kaepernick’s original state-
ments when the protests 
?rst began. The NFL, simi-
larly, cushioned themselves 
in stating that any actions 
during the anthem would 
be in solidarity and unity, 
as if they were not protests 
at all.
Surely it was not the 
Steelers’ intention to re?ect 
centuries of turmoil in the 
few minutes it takes to sing 
the national anthem. And 
yet, as the displays continue 
into the newest weekend of 
football, it does not seem 
that any of this is going to 
stop quietly. The President 
inserted himself into sports, 
and now sports are respond-
ing. Like it or not, the NFL 
can no longer be depoliti-
cized, but even as it strives 
to be a singular league, it 
does not look like it will ever 
truly be united either.

On friend crushes
Hi Ruth, 
I have a serious question that needs answering. 
Most people are familiar with the scenario of liking 
someone romantically and having them not feel the 
same way back. You’re either casually friendzoned 
or just straight up rejected. It’s totally not fun, but at 
least it’s not nearly as confusing as the less common 
conundrum that I’m currently experiencing.
What do I do when someone I just want to kick it 
with doesn’t feel the same? Like c’mon, man. I don’t 
want to fluff your nut, I just want to be your friend, 
so why don’t you feel the same way?! I might be 
coming off a bit too strong, but I just want them to 
know I think they’re really cool! Or maybe I’m not 
coming on strong enough? I just can’t figure it out... 
I mean, who wouldn’t want to be my friend? I give 
good hugs and I’m always down to buy you a cookie 
from ABP. Anyways, please help. I just want to be 
friends!
XOXO,
Platonic Admiration Only
Dear PAO,
You know, I’ve been writing this column for nearly a 
year now, and I’m honestly surprised that I haven’t 
yet had to answer “how do I make friends.” Which, 
if we’re honest, is not exactly what you’re asking, 
but hang in with me for a bit.
The big secret on making friends, or at the least get-
ting people to think positively about you, is to find a 
connection. Literally any connection. That old small-
talk joke about how people just complain about the 
weather? That counts. Is something happening on 
the Cut? Counts. Do you both have a shared profes-
sor who neither of you like? Definitely counts.
Look, people like people that they have things in 
common with, especially if it’s easy to hold a con-
versation with that person. Of course, you ideally 
won’t just talk about the weather for the rest of your 
acquaintance, but that’s what being an interesting 
human being is about. (You’re an interesting human 
being, I promise. Everybody has something they’re 
passionate about, and passion is what makes peo-
ple interesting.)
Once you’re ready to move past the small-talk 
phase, assuming you guys haven’t already sort of 
fallen into a friendship, all you really need to do is 
start inviting them to things. Things you think they’d 
be interested in, obviously, but don’t be discouraged 
if they say no.  
 
The first time they might think you’re just being nice, 
so you might want to invite them to a few things 
before you rule them out. (If they keep saying no 
and not offering to reschedule or don’t have any 
legitimate excuses, then maybe you should give 
them the space to come to you. They could just be 
going through a busy period in their life, but you 
shouldn’t be putting in all the effort.)
But here’s the thing — it sounds like you’ve already 
done all this. You’ve chatted with them, you’ve 
asked them to hang out, and they just seem... unin-
terested. Well, I hate to break it to you, but you 
can’t force anyone to be friends with you. I know, 
I’m sorry.  
 
Even if they seem really cool, and you really want 
to hang out with them, if they don’t feel the same, 
there’s really nothing you can do. Friendship isn’t all 
that different from love in that way.
If someone doesn’t want to befriend you when 
you’ve been nothing but a decent person to them, 
it’s going to feel like a rejection of you as a person, 
but it’s really not. It can’t be, not if they don’t know 
you that well. Sometimes that’s just how life plays 
out. It’s kind of a bummer, but you shouldn’t waste 
effort on someone who you’re getting no response 
from. You deserve better.
Keep hugging,
Ruth

Sinead Foley | Pillbox EditorBar Buddies: Gooski’s
A tragic story of love destroyed by distance and bus times
Part of becoming part of the over-twenty-one world 
is finding your bar aesthetic. Are you a classy wine 
bar person? A clubbing kind of person? Me, I’m a 
dive bar person. Give me cheap drinks, smokey air, 
and a pool table, and I’m a happy camper. 
This week we trekked out to Polish Hill for what 
Pittsburgh Magazine has labeled the best dive bar 
in the city, Gooski’s.
The location: The location was my least favorite 
part of this bar. What looks like a long but doable 
trip on two busses from campus during the day 
turns into an odyssey at night when busses run less 
regularly. Also, the trip there was a little nerve 
wracking as a girl traveling alone. Once in Polish 
Hill, Gooski’s is tucked away on an otherwise 
unassuming street.
There’s not much else going on in the area, but that 
gives the bar a “hidden gem” feel. It’s a smokey 
hole in the wall with graffitied walls illuminated 
with dusky red lights. A chalkboard behind the 
bar reads, “Southside called, they want their 
douchebags back.”
The drinks: They’re cheap, they’re strong, and 
they’re served by a no-nonsense bartender with a 
dry sense of humor. What more could you want?
This is not the place for fruity cocktails with a 
dozen ingredients. The bar is fully stocked but 
the only menus (written on the walls) are for their 
plethora of microbrews, so this isn’t really the place 
for exploring drinks. Go in knowing your go-to 
cocktail. This bar is cash only, so that’s another 
way you’ll need to come prepared.
The vibe: We were at Gooski’s on a Thursday, so 
the crowd was mostly from the neighborhood and 
pretty relaxed. Gooski’s is divided into two rooms, 
a slightly cramped front room with the bar, and a 
larger back room with ping pong and a pool table, 
as well as a stage for music acts on the weekends. 
As the night wore on, the front room filled up and 
became more boisterous, though the back room 
remained pretty empty and quiet. On a weekend, 
the place seems like it would get pretty rowdy.
The music is all jams from the ‘80s, the walls are 
covered in sassy commentary, and the bathroom 
graffiti is downright hilarious.
At the end of the day, Gooski’s is a classic dive 
bar, with all it entails. You’re gonna be around 
some fun and eccentric folks, might play pool with 
some new friends, and you’re definitely going to 
reek of smoke by the time you get home.
Lit or Nah: We’re going to go with Lit. It’s got a 
very clear vibe, and it does it well. If you want a 
no-nonsense dive, this is it. Unfortunately, it’s a bit 
too out of the way to justify the trip. If you happen 
to be out the way in Polish Hill, it’s 100 percent 
worth hitting up. But, alas, it’s not the convenient 
neighborhood dive I’ve been dreaming of.

We need to be more accepting of those who 
“turn the world to glass.” Like Ralph Waldo 
Emerson says in his essay, “The Poet,” the 
ideal individual in society is unconventional 
and deviates from the norm in order to 
expose society to the realities of the world. 
However, people like these, including the 
authors of many controversial yet important 
texts, are people we often need but do not 
want in our lives, so we try to silence their 
voices and society’s access to their bold 
claims.
Last Sunday, Sept. 24, marked the beginning 
of the 35th celebration of Banned Books 
Week. Started in 1982 by Judith Krug, a 
past employee of the American Library 
Association (ALA) and former director of 
ALA’s Office of Intellectual Freedom (OIF), 
the goal of the week is to bring awareness 
to the books that are challenged or banned 
in public libraries in America.
But books aren’t banned anymore, right? Many people 
probably assume this to be true, especially living in the 
United States, a country so proud of its Constitution 
and the freedoms declared under the First Amendment. 
However, if anything, book challenging and banning are 
becoming more prevalent and problematic.
Challenges, filed by people trying to prohibit books and 
other materials in their libraries or mandatory school  
curricula, mostly stem from concerns including  
“sexually explicit” content, “offensive language,” age 
inappropriateness, LGBTQ representation, and “religious 
viewpoints,” according to studies conducted by the OIF 
on reported book challenges. Of the hundreds of  
challenges filed and reported in 2016, more than half of 
the materials that were challenged were actually banned 
and removed from those particular libraries’ circulation. 
According to OIF data, bans previously were only  
implemented, on average, for 10 percent of total yearly 
challenges. The book bannings of 2016 are a  
concerning escalation from the norm.
With arguments about how society is becoming too  
“politically correct,” free speech and censorship have 
been the focal point of many discussions. People are 
worried about their ideas being suppressed in favor of 
more diverse and inclusive perspectives, yet fail to  
realize that they themselves often treat opposing people 
in the same way. In fact, the OIF reported that, “of the 
2015 Top Ten Most Frequently Challenged Books, nine 
of them contained diverse content... includ[ing] content 
by or about people of color, LGBTQ people and/or 
people with disabilities.”
In the divided and  
polarized society we 
live in, we must learn to 
recognize our differences 
and the rights granted to us 
under the First Amendment.  
 
While people may have  
conflicting viewpoints, none really have the right to 
silence others’ voices or restrict access to materials just 
because they clash with their values or beliefs. This year, 
Banned Books Week’s theme was appropriately named 
“Our Right to Read,” and encouraged people to express 
their opposing views on problematic literature, instead of 
immediately pushing to ban.
Most, if not all, of the concerns leading to book  
challenges are subjective, merely a matter of differing 
opinions. Everyone should be able to freely choose to 
read as they please and not restrict others’ access to 
education and broader perspectives.
Several years ago, the Library of Congress created an 
exhibit entitled, Books that Shaped America. Among 
the 100 titles included on the list, 30 of them have been 
challenged or banned. Truthfully, this makes a lot of 
sense. The most influential works are typically the most 
controversial — they make such a big impact because 
they leave us reeling from their words and the messages 
within. They open our eyes to new perspectives and 
make transparent the bitter truth of our reality (or the 
harsh realities of the past), which we try so  
desperately to ignore or forget.
Restricting books is not the solution. Facing  
conflict and dissent is easier said than done, but 
it’s the only way society will ever come close to 
being where it should be. Because even if we 
have differing views and our ideal societies don’t 
seem to align, we all essentially want the same 
things: respect and acknowledgement. Whenever 
we shut others down, nobody wins — resentment 
only grows, and the chasm between each side 
widens.
As Banned Books Week comes to a close, we 
must remember that although officially over, the 
celebration doesn’t have to stop. We should  
continue to carry out the values that the week has 
taught us and become well-informed, vocal  
members of society. Rather than shutting each 
other down and shying away from dissonant  
opinions, we must strive to educate ourselves through 
literature and conversation.

Lula Beresford-Banker | Contributing Editor
With a delivery both straightforward and dynamic, 
author Susan Perabo read the second chapter of her 
latest book The Fall of Lisa Bellow to a rapt audi-
ence in Danforth Conference Room last Monday. 
A Professor of English and Writer in Residence at 
Dickinson College, a small liberal arts college about 
a three-hour drive away in Carlisle, PA, Perabo has 
published numerous works of fiction over her career, 
in both literary magazines and as four books. The 
Fall of Lisa Bellow is her second novel, and her other 
two published books are short story collections.
Prior to her reading in Danforth, Perabo visited an 
introductory fiction course where she talked to stu-
dents about her craft, her writing process, and her 
experience as an author. In her introduction to the 
students in the course, Perabo mentioned her surpris-
ing evolution into being the author she is today. She 
was initially interested in film, and in the course of 
studying film at college took a writing course to help 
with her screenplay skills. From then on it became a 
passion, and she eventually went on to get her MFA.
Her work, particularly her short story work, seems 
a little at odds with her confident, no-nonsense 
demeanor. Her work in Why They Run the Way they 
Do, a recent short story collection, explores deeply 
emotional themes of infidelity, loneliness, and coming 
to terms with a life one might not have envisioned 
for oneself. Her characters are always complex, 
and a bit acerbic, and their emotional lives seem 
to pop off the page. Perabo said it herself that she 
wouldn’t define herself as an “emotional person,” 
or a person who wears their heart on their sleeve. 
This contrast between her more stoic public persona 
and the intimate and vulnerable character portrayal 
in her writing makes reading these works all the 
more fascinating.
Her newest novel seems to continue her thoughtful 
and emotional examination of her characters’ lives 
and ways of thinking. The Fall of Lisa Bellow fol-
lows a middle-school aged girl Meredith and her 
mother Claire as they recover from the abduction 
of Lisa Bellow, a classmate of Meredith’s who was 
kidnapped in front of Meredith in a sandwich shop. 
Due to the use of these two protagonists, the book 
is as much about Meredith’s process of coping with 
the tragedy and her coming-of-age story wherein 
the horrific event of the abduction features so promi-
nently as it is a thoughtful rendering of a mother 
who is trying to navigate the process of supporting 
her daughter through a life so completely altered by 
something out of her control.
The chapter she read to the audience on Monday — 
an audience made up of English professors, students, 
and other interested parties — mapped the inner dia-
logue and thought progression of Claire. In the chap-
ter, Claire is thinking back to when Meredith’s broth-
er Evan was being bullied in elementary school, and 
how angry and overwhelmed it made Claire feel. 
How does Claire handle it when her children encoun-
ter adversity? What are her instincts? How does she 
cope with the challenges facing her offspring?  
 
The chapter essentially took place solely in Claire’s 
head. She feels the urge to curse at the students who 
called her son a “porker,” despite Evan’s assurances 
that he’s fine. She demonstrates restraint, but it is 
not without significant effort. The chapter ends with 
a scene where Claire has her son’s bully as a dental 
patient, and causes him unnecessary and profound 
pain during a superfluous dental examination. The 
scene made me viscerally uncomfortable, a sentiment 
shared by audience members during the question 
and answer portion of the event after the conclusion 
of the chapter.
When asked about her use of individuals from her 
life as a basis for fictional characters, Perabo stated 
that no person on the page was a representation of 
someone she knew, and that it is very difficult, if not 
impossible, to do justice to a living individual through 
a fictionalized account. However, she mentioned, she 
remembers feeling intense anger and confusion when 
her children faced undeserved nastiness in school. 
While she never went to the lengths that Claire did, 
in developing the character of Claire Perabo tried 
to imagine what type of person would actually act 
on her feelings of frustration with a stranger’s child. 
Thus the dentist section was born. In imagining what 
sort of person might have the opportunity to lash 
back out to a young offender, she fell upon dentistry 
as this sort of opportunity for her character.
During the question part of the afternoon, Perabo 
talked further about her writing process, such as hav-
ing an ending in mind prior to beginning, or at least 
close to the beginning of a narrative, as well as her 
first published piece, and her editing process. Unlike 
some fiction writers, Perabo does very little research, 
and instead likes to get the story on the page, and 
then during revisions, fill in the vague depictions with 
accurate descriptions and terminology. Though of 
course an endlessly challenging endeavor, Perabo’s 
visceral, thoughtful, and introspective narratives 
seem to demonstrate a more clinical process than an 
overwhelmingly emotional one.
When thinking about flighty and emotionally 
unstable authors of fame and fortune, getting to 
see Perabo’s genius coming from a place of intense 
thoughtfulness and non-neuroticism was a privilege.

Q&A with 
Tyler Bates
6
Friday night I found myself backstage at Stage AE surrounded by black leather-clad, heavily makeup-ed, world-class musicians. These were not just any 
musicians, they were the members of Marilyn Manson’s band. Among them was Tyler Bates, a highly sought-after rock guitarist who has proven himself a 
master at creating astounding musical narratives.
Bates is a life long musician who transitioned from the world of touring and live performances into a prolific career composing television and film scores. 
He has created musical landscapes for films such as Dawn of the Dead, 300 and more recent blockbusters including Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 1. and 
Vol 2, John Wick, and Atomic Blonde. Throughout his career, Bates has forged partnerships with countless artists, including film directors Zack Snyder 
and James Gunn, and musician Marilyn Mason. Currently on tour with Manson in support of their latest album, Heaven Upside Down, Bates spends his 
time delivering killer guitar performances, composing music in makeshift hotel room studios, and trying to get some sleep. Humble, immensely talented, 
and fully enamored with his craft, Bates hopes that this new album will excite and impress fans and that he can continue to craft stories through composi-
tion both on screen and on stage.
You’ve worked on numerous projects as a producer, composer, and 
musician. How do you see those roles as similar to or contrasting 
each other?
I would say all three roles overlap. For film composition I need a seri-
ous degree of production skills and for production, my work is informed 
by my experience as a musician. Everything has started to intersect 
in my life, so all of my projects, no matter what role I’m approaching 
them from, are about understanding my collaborators and telling their 
story through music. The core is about storytelling and emotion, and 
that carries into every space I inhabit.
What does the physical process of composing for the screen look 
like? Is the score informed by the movie or is the movie informed by 
your music?
Every single project is a triathlon. And each one is constantly evolving, 
with certain scenes getting compressed or drawn out and the score 
changing to fit those adjustments. So it might end up being a  
90-minute score, but there were well over 100 minutes of composi-
tion that changed as the process went on. And that’s the crazy thing; 
I might end up producing more hours of music for one film than most 
musicians produce in their entire career.
And the give and take between the visuals and the composition differs 
project-to-project and person-to-person. For Guardians of the Galaxy, 
I worked with James Gunn who I’ve known for years and collaborated 
on tons of projects with, so we were able to approach the process a 
bit differently. I actually composed the score based off the script and 
certain pre sketches, so I was writing to the film sequences before they 
even existed. The actors would act with ear buds in so every one would 
move to the tempo and the emotion of the composition.
You’ve worked on incredibly distinct and unique projects with talents in 
both the film and music industry. How would you describe your creative 
process, and how is that process informed by collaboration?
I’m always open. My creative process is never the same twice, and it’s 
never about just making music. It’s about creating a conversation. It’s about 
understanding people. Music is a vehicle, it’s how I get through things, so 
I’m always looking for projects that teach me and challenge me where I 
can continue to grow and maintain some relevance.
I never really know what to expect because there’s always some new direc-
tion I’m able to take my work. Recently I worked on the composition for the 
Guardians of the Galaxy attraction at Disney California Adventure, and I 
got to work with their team of Imagineers. The spirit they brought was defi-
nitely not Hollywood, and I found it really refreshing. We got to work in 
a team, so I knew that I needed to bring my skills and point of view to the 
work but that ultimately we had a job to do and we would do it together.
So when it comes to collaboration I would say it depends on what you’re 
working on. If you’re working on an indie film versus a project for a large 
studio, the experience is completely different. The size of the team changes, 
so the whole process and feeling changes. But I try to make my collabora-
tors feel comfortable so that they can feel what I’m trying to convey even if 
they don’t have a technical understanding.
“Everything has started to intersect in my life, so all 
of my projects, no matter what role I’m approach-
ing them from, are about understanding my col-
laborators and telling their story through music. The 
core is about storytelling and emotion, and that 
carries into every space I inhabit.”

What do you look for in a collaborator, and how do you go about forming 
those partnerships?
I just ask the universe to bring good people into my life. I don’t know if life 
is too long or too short to work with people you don’t like, but I have had 
the good fortune of working with people who elevate my game. I mean, 
James Gunn is a genius. Zack Snyder, Rob Zombie, both geniuses. And I’ve 
been lucky enough to work with them on multiple occasions. Ultimately, I 
like to work with people who are excited and striving.
That’s why I’m so appreciative of all my time working in film and television. 
That process of iterating and meeting deadlines is what gave me the ability 
to articulate ideas quickly, and that’s what has allowed me to collaborate 
with people like [Marilyn] Manson. Those experiences gave me the stamina 
and capabilities needed for us to work well together, and I didn’t have that 
before working in the film industry.
Could you elaborate on what it’s like working with Marilyn Manson and how it may 
be different from other collaborations?
Well, [working with Manson] is different because there’s nobody else like him. And it’s 
different than my film score work because no matter what, I will always love to write, 
record, and play rock music. Rock music is hurting so badly right now, and Manson is 
the last bastion of real icons, so I want to do my part to help the cause. We’re like broth-
ers; the first time I met him I never would have expected to be writing or playing with 
him, but somehow it works. He challenges me and we feed off each other’s energies.
You’ve worked on such a diverse range of projects across different mediums 
and genres. Is there a certain tone you’re trying to convey in all your work, 
or does it change depending on the project?
I think the me of it, whatever project it is, is identifiable. People who know me 
can recognize my guitar playing or sense it’s my work immediately. So in a 
sense I think there is a signature in all my work. I’m looking through the lens of 
my life experience, and that authenticity and sincerity is what I hope is transcen-
dent to the audience. I’m trying to convey emotion, not an impression of emo-
tion, in all my work.
What advice do you have for young artists?
Be in touch with your spirit, and pursue your art for that reason and purpose it gives 
you. It’s easy to get jaded to the value of your work, especially when certain industries 
aren’t paying as much or there isn’t as much demand. But you can’t pander to the cli-
mate of the industry. You can change things. You just have to be willing to do whatever 
it takes so you can do what you love. Music has been my whole life; it’s all I’ve known. 
I’ve had other jobs, but they were never instead of music, they were so I would be able 
to keep doing it. Ultimately, I would say a backup plan is a bad idea. Because if you 
have one, you’ll take it.
“Rock music is hurting so badly right now, and Manson is the last 
bastion of real icons, so I want to do my part to help the cause. 
We’re like brothers; the first time I met him I never would have 
expected to be writing or playing with him, but somehow  
it works.”

Questions on how we consume and present art on 
the oppression of people of color have moved to 
the forefront of conversation in the art world as 
a result of the election and the turbulence of our 
current global climate. 
Recently, white artists such as Dana Schutz have 
come under scrutiny for their use of the history of 
violence against black bodies in their art. Turning 
non-black audiences into spectators of people of 
color and excluding artists of color from these 
spaces can perpetuate the tendency of American 
society to profit off of racial violence and exploi-
tation. How do we curate and share the work of 
artists of color without falling into that trap?
While the function of gallery spaces is a place for 
the dynamic current conversations of art, muse-
ums like the Carnegie Museum of Art (CMOA) 
are a place to learn the visual language to under-
stand art as a broader field. Art museums create 
a cultural history, and the items preserved in 
museums are what generations to come will reflect 
on when understanding our current views of our 
past. And it is the place where future generations 
will see how we ask questions about the relation-
ships between race, oppression, and art.
This summer, an exhibition entitled 20/20 opened 
at the Carnegie Museum of Art. The exhibition is 
a collaboration between the Carnegie Museum of 
Art and The Studio Museum in Harlem to bring 
together the work of forty artists — twenty from 
each venue — created over the past 100 years. 
The gorgeous, white wall spaces of CMOA are 
filled with an expansive array of artists from vari-
ous periods in art history and at different levels 
of the art industry. Documentary photographers, 
leading contemporary artists of color, and out-
sider artists of color are brought together in this 
exhibition on the narrative of racial politics and 
black identity in America.
With the huge range of work and seriousness of 
subject matter, the curation is ambitious. Each 
piece is paired with a longer museum label 
explanation, and each section of the exhibition 
comes with a title and explanation of the curato-
rial choices. The viewer’s movement through the 
gallery is key to the narrative of this exhibition. 
Although it is not strictly chronological, it feels 
conscious of an unfolding historical narrative. The 
subtle growth of strength and subjectivity of black 
voices in the work as the exhibition progresses 
serves as the framework for this curation.
The first room open with the centerpiece of 
Pennsylvanian artist Horace Pippin’s “Abe 
Lincoln’s First Book,” a piece which paints Lincoln 
with the visual language of sainthood. The sur-
rounding work in the first two sections entitled 
“A More Perfect Union” are intended to discuss 
historical context, with artists of color working 
to come to terms with the history of slavery and 
oppression. The inclusion of one of Jasper Johns’s 
American flag pieces was odd, given that Jasper 
Johns was a white artist, as was the central focus 
on the glorification of Lincoln, because of their 
turned focus on White America. The museum 
states it intended to question national identity and 
democracy; the voice of the paired statements is 
anthropological, an outsider looking in. It relies 
on the idea that the viewer sees American iden-
tity and Blackness as exclusive ideas and asks the 
viewer to explore that conflict.
The jump from this perspective into the sections of 
“Working Thought” and “American Landscape” 
was then at once jarring and natural. The work in 
these spaces was dedicated to the discussion of 
class, violence, and exploitation. Artists such as 
Kara Walker, David Hammons, and Titus Kaphar 
vary in degrees of abstraction and modes of 
expression, but all in all it is an exploration of 
trauma perpetrated by the American economy. 
20/20
Turning non-black audiences into spectators of people 
of color and excluding artists of color from these 
spaces can perpetuate the tendency of American 
society to profit off racial violence.
Theodore Teichman | Visual Editor20/20 at CMOA

---------------------------------------------------

Walker’s folksy silhouettes portray graphic violence 
against black women while Black Wall Street by Noah 
Davis is a remembrance of the incredible violence of 
the 1921 race riots against an affluent black com-
munity. This section tries to cover so much, and the 
matter of factness of violence on black bodies feels 
uncomfortably contained in these vignettes of history.
This part of 20/20 builds into the central exhibition of 
the Teenie Harris and James VanDerZee documentary 
photography segment entitled “Documenting Black 
Life.” Both these exhibitions begin to demonstrate 
the struggle of building identity through violence and 
class struggle, but this section focuses on the nostalgia 
of intimate moments that would have otherwise been 
forgotten by history. The Pittsburgh and Harlem com-
munities presented in sepia film and older generations 
of clothing played with this narrative of history lost, 
hidden, or ignored.
It was unexpectedly startling to enter the final sec-
tions, “Shrine for Spirit” and “Forms of Resistance.” 
The enormous portrait of Michelle Obama by Collier 
Schorr that was published in T: The New York Times 
Style Magazine was the piece that articulated the 
feeling of these sections. These rooms were dedicated 
to the unabashed, intensely personal focus on the 
self. These works focused on activism, honoring the 
identity and culture of people of color. They shared 
the interactions of artists of color and media from 
their first person perspective. But the Michelle Obama 
and Kerry James Marshall portraits as end pieces had 
the biggest impact. Contrasted in the same room with 
Ellen Gallagher’s mixed media pieces with magazines 
and Lorraine O’Grady’s performance stills where she 
flays herself with a cat-o-nine-tails in a beauty pag-
eant character, these pieces stood out in emotional 
resonance.
It was because Michelle Obama’s portrait had the 
only black woman given a name and understood as 
a person and cultural icon who was not in this exhibi-
tion because of her connection to exploitation and 
violence. A regal, accomplished, and beautiful black 
woman who is so beloved placed so prominently in 
the exhibition with admittedly complicated symbols of 
wealth was powerful. In contrast, the vibrant, joyful 
portrait “Untitled (Gallery)” by Kerry James Marshall 
of a black woman relaxed in her own space was 
important because it allowed for the more intimate, 
ordinary person parallel to the Michelle Obama 
photograph.
The effect of these portraits in the final room would 
not have been the same without the documentation 
of struggle and trauma we saw previously. It was 
important as well that the ending of this exhibition 
wasn’t through rose-colored lenses, and that it didn’t 
stick to a chronological order — it recognizes that the 
fight for equality is ongoing. The collections allow the 
viewer to see how the artists of color choose to play 
with Western artistic traditions versus to create their 
own. It parallels the tension of existing within a white 
dominated society, and the questions of how to move 
forward.
The Carnegie Museum of Art and all white cube gal-
lery spaces were created with a literal manifesto of 
whiteness connecting to sophistication. But exhibitions 
such as 20/20, and society as a whole, are working 
to transform these kinds of elitist institutions into some-
thing more inclusive. The people who come to this 
exhibition are likely to be middle and upper class indi-
viduals open to racial discourse, and some of the mes-
sages of industry and oppression feel overly subtle as 
if trying not to offend. The desire for a nationalistic 
sentiment is present throughout the gallery spaces, 
but the question about American identity is presented 
as confused as we feel it today.
This exhibition, though imperfect, was ultimately suc-
cessful. The discomfort with these questions of con-
suming violence and oppression, being a spectator in 
the room where you learn about the complexities of 
identity and racial politics in this country, is important. 
The exhibition is not only about grief and trauma, 
but also about hope and agency. It allows for the 
black artist and subject to be the primary voice and 
announces a commitment to understanding these sto-
ries. 20/20 is open until the end of the year. In this 
time in our history, with the national dialogue about 
neo-colonialism and NFL protests and class conflict 
ever-present, it is important to hear the voices of art-
ists of color and sit with your questions.20/209

Attending The Holiday event on Saturday evening 
definitely helped push me out of my comfort zone. The 
Holiday: A Dinner Party, was hosted by four Carnegie 
Mellon students: Daniel Yongxin, Nick Boston, Faith 
Kaufman, and Sarah Stinson-Hurwitz. It took place in 
the Art Park, a green space for use by artists, right 
next to the Carnegie Mellon Integrated Innovation 
Institute, and across from Chipotle and Orient Express. 
The purpose of the event was to commemorate The 
Holiday, which used to be Pittsburgh’s oldest gay 
bar that opened in 1968 and closed in 2007. The bar 
was located where the Art Park is now, and it was a 
popular spot for people in the local LGBTQ community 
to mingle, hang out, and enjoy themselves without 
the pressures and judgement from others in society. 
For about forty years, the bar fostered a safe space 
for people from all different backgrounds and sexual 
orientations. These overarching themes of inclusion 
and freedom of expression were the focus of the din-
ner party. Several activities were organized, and the 
setting was decorated to create a very casual and 
relaxed environment for strangers to get to know one 
another.
I don’t usually go out for large gatherings, and it’s 
been a while since I had the opportunity to meet new 
people in a single setting. Because it’d been a long 
time since I attended any mix and mingle event, I’d 
become more comfortable staying reserved and only 
spending time with people in my close friend group; 
I had forgotten the exuberant feeling of getting to 
know new people. When I arrived at the event, one 
of the hosts immediately paired me with the person I 
was standing next to. The host explained that every 
guest needed a partner to experience event with, and 
partners must be complete strangers to one another.
I was excited, but also a little nervous to get to know 
someone new. I didn’t know what to expect, and I was 
afraid that the entire experience would end up being 
awkward. My partner and I walked into the parklet 
together, and the first thing that caught our eyes was 
the event’s setup; it was very simple, yet elegant. A 
bar was set up where people were serving guests 
apple cider and cookies, blankets and rugs were laid 
on the ground, and fairy lights along with the sounds 
of soft music surrounded all of us. The space itself 
gave off such good vibes, and it helped me to calm 
down and become more relaxed before getting to 
know my partner better.
The first activity we participated in involved my part-
ner and I writing down a secret we have and placing 
it in a jar of other people’s secrets. Then, we each 
had to take out a secret from the jar and talk about 
them with one another. By participating in this simple 
activity, I was able to learn a lot about my partner, like 
where she’s from and her opinions on events going on 
in the world. We were getting along well, and I real-
ized that we had a lot in common.
Another activity during the event encouraged me and 
my partner to engage in more conversations about 
random topics, like how do we define a perfect day or 
whether or not we’d like to become famous. Learning 
these new and random things about my partner, and 
vice versa, was exciting and reminded me of how 
wonderful it is to meet new people. In a way, I was 
able to learn more about myself and the things that 
make (and don’t make) me happy in life, just by figur-
ing out what my partner and I shared in common. My 
partner and I agreed that there actually is comfort in 
the “newness” that comes with new experiences and 
meeting new people. Because I was only meeting my 
partner for the first time and she knew nothing about 
me, I felt like I had this freedom to be my genuine self 
and not conform to any expectations that she may or 
may not have of me. Looking around me and seeing 
other partner pairs talking and laughing with each 
other, I sensed that I wasn’t the only one who felt this 
comforting freedom.
My evening at The Holiday: A Dinner Party was filled 
with engaging conversations, good food, and relaxing 
vibes. These were what The Holiday bar had to offer 
to the local LGBTQ community, and I have a better 
understanding now of why it was so beloved by its 
guests. At the dinner party, partners were also able 
to draw each other on a mural. Before leaving the 
event, I looked at the mural, which was almost com-
pletely covered with drawings of people’s partners. 
It was amazing to see how partners became friends 
during the event, and how what looks like an empty 
lot beside a busy road was able to create such an 
inclusive environment that fostered these friendships.
