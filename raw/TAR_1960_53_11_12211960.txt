Tartans Buffeted By 
Wash-Jeff, 69-59
Mike Flynn served 27 points,^ 
but that wasn’t enough to turn 
back the W & J Prexies in a 69- 
59 contest Saturday night. Tech’s 
offense was once again a one man 
show with Flynn instead of Sofia 
stealing J;he lime light. Mike 
dropped in 10 field goals, most of 
them in a futile second half ef­
fort, to lead the scoring for both 
; *'ams.
The Tartans grabbed the lead 
early in the game and were out 
front until the Prexies closed the 
gap at 20-20 half-way through the 
first period. From there on, the 
Tartans never saw the daylight. 
It was 38-33 at half-time and the 
gap stretched to 18 points at one 
point.
W & J had obviously gotten 
wind of hot shooting Bill Sofia 
(Tnd the Prexies were ready for 
him. Soffa was stopped by Warren 
Falk-and Tobin Simon until he 
was benched during the latter 
part of the second half.
Earlier in the week the Tar­
tans had downed Waynesburg 
gaining their second West Penn 
Conference victory and evening 
their league record at 2-2.
For those staying in the Pitts­
burgh area over the holidays, two 
r^jme games will be played. Tech 
meets Westminster in Skibo® gym 
on December 21st and St. Vin­
cents on the 30th in a double- 
header at the Pitt Field House. 
Both these games are In the West 
Penn Conference.
Evening Students 
Plan for Future 
Social Calendar
Evening Student Council met on 
December 4, to review the success 
of social events sponsored for 
evening students this year and to 
arrange for future affairs for the 
balance of this semester and the 
spring semester. The Mona-Lisa 
Supper Dance of November 26, 
was socially successful but attend­
ance could have been increased, 
‘fietter publicity and student noti­
fication was suggested to increase 
participation in social affairs.
Victor Sabol reported on plans 
for the Christmas Assembly. An 
intensive effort to notify all stu­
dents and faculty will be made. 
A fine program has been arranged 
which includes the Westinghouse 
Male Chorus, an address by Dr. B. 
R. Teare, Jr., and invocation by 
Reverend Dan Little of the 
friendship Community Church.
Newspaper
Mary Alice Peterson reported on 
the progress of the newspaper for 
evening students. A trial edition 
will be mailed to students in Jan­
uary. It is hoped the newspaper 
will be successfully approved by 
the administration and Council.
Arrangements are being made
Paintings by 
Beaman Shown
An exhibition of paintings by 
Richard B. Beaman is being pre­
sented by the Department of Fine 
Arts at Carnegie Institute. This is 
the second in the current series of 
one-man shows by Pittsburgh 
artists. The exhibit is in third 
floor Gallery K through January 
15.
Richard B. Beaman is a native 
of Waltham, Massachusetts. He 
received an B.S. degree from Har­
vard University in 1932 and a B.D. 
degree from Union Theological 
Seminary in 1935. He- has also 
done academic work at the Eliot 
O’Hara School of Watercolor 
Painting in 1932, Columbia Uni­
versity Teachers College in 1939, 
University of California in the 
summers of 1948 and 1949, and 
Massachusetts Institute of Tech­
nology in 1949.
From 1939 tnrough. 1955, with 
the exception of the war years 
1942-46, during which he was in 
the Navy, Professor Beaman was 
the Head of the Art Department 
at the University of Redlands. He 
also taught in the summer school 
at Long Beach State College in 
1955 and was the Stickney Lec­
turer in Art at California Insti­
tute of Technology from 1950-52. 
He received a Ford Fellowship in 
1951-52. Since 1955 he has been 
an Associate Professor of Paint­
ing, Design and Sculpture at Car­
negie Institute of Technology.
Professor Beaman has had his 
works exhibited in several jury 
shows on both coasts, and in New 
York City and the Los Angeles 
area has had one-man shows. In 
1958-59 he was represented in the 
Pittsburgh International, and in 
March of 1960 he had a one-man 
show of oils at tre Arts and Crafts 
Center in Pittsburgh. The North 
Atlantic Quarterly published his 
article, “The Cubist Witch,” in the 
1949 Winter issue, .and a second 
article, “Creative Thinking: Arts 
and Sciences” appeared in Educa­
tion Magazine in September, 1954.
SGA Discusses All Students Invited To Attend
Skibo Open House On Jan. 4
January 4 will mark “Skibo Open House” day on the 
Carnegie Tech campus.
Dr. J. C. Warner, President, Dean George K. Brown, 
Dean of the Division of Student Affairs and the Administra-
Coffee Hours
The subject of attendance at the 
sfudent-faculty coffee was dis­
cussed at the Student Congress 
meeting held on December 19. It 
has been hopad that certain 
changes would result in better 
participation on the part of the 
students and faculty.
Suggestions were made con­
cerning the time the discussions 
are held. Even though the length 
is unlimited, many people are still 
not attending because of con­
flicting engagements or because 
they don’t seem to be informed. 
By using alternating periods and 
days, more publicity would be 
required, more people would be 
acquainted with these gatherings 
and more might find it convenient 
to attend.
tive Staff are extending an invita-^ 
tion to all students to join them !
from 2 to 5 p.m. and commemo-
rate the completion of the $2,850,-
000 building which now houses all 
student activities.
With the single exception of the 
Snack Bar, all food service areas 
will be open for regular, planned 
service in the forenoon of the 4th. 
This includes the dining rooms 
which are presently in operation 
plus the faculty and private din­
ing rooms. The Snack Bar will be 
opened officially for regular, 
planned service at the conclusion 
of open house.
As a part of the open house!
event, the kitchen areas in the 
building will be open for inspec­
tion from 3 to 4 p.m. The Stouffer 
Management will be glad to show 
visitors through the kitchen dur­
ing this hour. There will be other 
tours throughout the entire build­
ing.
Dean Brown comments: /‘This is 
an excellent opportunity for stu­
dents to see and understand the 
many services and features of 
their new campus activities center.
I know the President and mem­
bers of the administration are 
looking forward to welcoming you 
on the afternoon of the Fourth.”
The President 
Dean, Division of Student Affairs 
and the 
Administrative Staff 
cordially invite the 
Students 
of

Carnegie Tech will be present- 
| ed at the College Bowl, sponsored 
by General Electric, on January
15. Whether the idea of our at­
tendance is good or bad depends 
on personal opinion. Carnegie 
Tech is not as well-known nation­
ally as it deserves to be. The pub­
licity received by our participa­
tion would be most beneficial. 
Even if we were to lose, the rat­
ing of the school would not be 
hurt.
One of the main purposes of 
the program is to get the public, 
mainly students who may be con­
sidering' colleges, interested in the 
! goals and purposes of different j schools.
The participants were chosen 
| for their top factors and ability 
; to answer questions put to thefri 
quickly and accurately. Marty 
| Cannon, along with a few other 
students began early in October 
to select those who would fill the 
: basic requirements. Those chosen
I were asked to go through an elim- 
! ination process consisting of ques- 
i tion and answer periods similar 
j to those used on the program it- 
I self. Each week they met in the 
| College of Fine Arts to compete 
V for the privilege of appearing on 
the panel. Gradually the list nar- 
| rowed to those who were best 
i qualified.
The final panel consists of Mar- 
, gery Morgenstern, a junior in 
physics from Houston, Texas;
| John Steyers, a senior in drama.
| from Pittsburgh; Marvin Reich, a 
I freshman in metallurgy, from 
j New York City and Victor Hill, a 
; senior in mathematics, from Pitts- 
j burgh. Henry Harvat, a junior in 
| music, from Pittsburgh and 
' Charles Oberdorf, a sophomore 
| in drama, from Aldan, Pennsyl-
I vania, will be the alternates.
Support from the audience by 
our students and alumni will 
boost the morale of our team and 
help them represent Tech in the 
true Carnegie tradition.
Tech Swimmers 
Win Final Relay to 
Beat W&J 48-47
By V. Cholewicki
Trailing throughout most of the 
contest, the Tech swimmers re­
versed the tide in a melodramatic 
finish. Behind 41-47, the Tartans 
won the final relay, gaining the 
seven points needed to squeak p *st 
W&J, 48-47.
Tom Vandersalm was the first 
Tartan to score, placing first in 
the 220 yd. freestyle with a time 
of 2:23.5. Pat Crecine followed 
with a victory in the 60 yd. free­
style. These two firsts plus Dick 
Line’s seconds in the individual 
medley and the butterfly account­
ed for most of Tech's 19 points up 
to the 100 yd. freestyle event.
Crecine and Fred Schirm placed 
first and second respectively in 
this important event which proved 
to be the turning point of the 
meet. Bill DeKleine, a converted 
freestyler, surprised everyone by 
winning the backstroke in 2:36.3. 
Vandersalm followed with a first 
in the 440 yd. freestyle.
Breaststrokers Strassen and 
Wachtel set up the Tech victory 
by placing second and third re­
spectively, raising Tech’s point to­
tal to 41. The freestyle relay team 
of Schirm, McLaughlin, Vander­
salm and Crecine then easily won 
the final event and the meet.
Alumni Picture 
To Be Taken
- At 11:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Jan­
uary 10, a group photograph of all 
sons and daughters of alumni will 
be taken in the All-purpose room 
in Skibo. Announcements are be­
ing mailed to all students who we 
know are children of alumni, but 
in case our recoi'ds are incomplete, 
we would appreciate having any­
one to whom this applies show up, 
whether he receives an announce­
ment in the mail or not.

Roving Reporter
Cultural Activities 
Encouraged; But 
No Time Allowed
QUESTION: Does the full­
time educational program at 
CIT allow or encourage par­
ticipation in extracurricular, 
cultural opportunities?
Dinah Mathias, Sophomore, 
Drama—“The question, as applied 
td the Drama Department, is 
questionable in validity. Not only 
does the department not allow 
time for off-campus cultural ac­
tivities, but it insists upon en­
couraging the students of the de­
partment to attend these activities 
by placing posters and free 
tickets on the bulletin board.”
Lee Weller, Freshman, Home 
Sc—“While the educational pro­
gram at CIT encourages extra­
curricular activities, it does not, 
:n reality, allow time for time. 
The teachers assign such large 
quantities of home\york that in 
order for a student to participate 
in activities it is necessary to 
study late into the night. The 
teachers should concentrate more 
on work in the classroom, ..hereby 
leaving the students more free 
time in which they can take part 
take part in the various cultural 
activities offered.”
A. L. Henderson, Freshman, 
French — “The educational pro­
gram allows, but does not en­
courage, cultural opportunities. 
The student who is interested in 
cultural will make time for it, 
but he will have to exclude other 
extracuricular activities from his 
program in order to profit fully 
from the educational opportuni­
ties Tech offers.”
Vince Freund, Junior, EE. — 
“Since Tech’s campus is located 
in the cultural center of Pitts­
burgh, the Tech student prob­
ably has more cultural interests 
than students on other campuses. 
Tech also has a large and diver­
sified program of extracurricular 
activities; however, the educa­
tional program in most E&S 
courses does not leave the stu­
dent of average intelligence j 
enough time to take advantage of 
these opportunities which are 
very important to broadening 
lis mind and character.”
Faculty Speaks
The Engineer Performs A 
Vital Function for Society
The engineer is a “vital link” in 
our society—he “spans the gap” 
between science and the applica­
tion of science to other areas. So 
said Dr. George Bugliarello, 
Assistant Professor in the Depart­
ment of Civil Engineering. Dr. 
Bugliarello is now engrossed in 
research which promises to have 
medical significance.
He and Dr. Thomas E. Stelson, 
Professor and Head of the Depart­
ment o* Civil Engineering, with 
the assistance of John Hayden, 
graduate student in Civil engi­
neering, are involved in an engi­
neering study of the flow of blood. 
The flow is of “great interest” be­
cause of the red cells suspended in 
blood. There are several theories 
concerning the relative motion of 
the liquid and solid components, 
but this has never been measured.
Docztorates
Dr. Bugliarello studied other 
liquid flows and other particles 
while at MIT, where he received 
his Doctorate of Science. Previ­
ously, he received his Doctorate 
of Engineering from the Univer­
sity of Padua, Italy, and studied 
on a Fulbright at Tech. He has 
been here as an instructor for 
over a year.
The research for this study of 
flows is conducted in the Mar­
garet Morrison biological labora­
tories through the cooperation of 
Dr. Maunder, Head of the De­
partment of Biological Sciences. 
Dr. Bugliarello said that the study 
“would not be possible without 
this cooperation of the Biology 
Department.”
Dr. Bugliarello suggests that 
more engineers look at biological 
systems because “nature is more 
efficient than we can hope to be.” 
ly9OSnsnUA 19rv0sOSs 
Engineers today, Dr. Bugliarello 
asserts, “should be more humani­
ties oriented.” Engineers must be 
able to express themselves, and 
government needs men with en­
gineering background. Engineer­
ing effort is also essential in un­
derdeveloped areas, which “hav­
ing a man in space will not af­
fect.”

DECK THE HALLS
The time has come to make out our Christmas shopping lists, 
for Christmas will be upon us quicker than you can say Jack 
Robinson. (Have you ever wondered, incidentally, about the 
origin of this interesting phrase “Quicker than you can say 
Jack Robinson”? Well sir, the original phrase was French— 
Plus vite que de dire Jacques RobespierreJack Robinson is, 
as everyone knows, an anglicization of Jacques Robespierre who 
was, as everyone knows, the famous figure from the French 
Revolution who, as everyone knows, got murdered in his bath 
by Danton, Murat, Caligula, and Aaron Burr.
(The reason people started saying “Quicker than you can say 
Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is called in English- 
speaking countries) ” is quite an interesting little story. It seems 
that Robespierre’s wife, Georges Sand, got word of the plot to 
murder her husband in his bath. All she had to do to save his 
life was call his name and warn him. But, alas, quicker than 
she could say Jacques Robespierre, she received a telegram from 
her old friend Frederic Chopin who was down in Majorca setting 
lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto.” Chopin said he 
needed Georges Sand’s help desperately because he could not 
find a rhyme for “Warsaw.” Naturally, Georges Sand could not 
refuse such an urgent request.
(Well sir, Georges Sand went traipsing off to Majorca, but 
before she left she told her little daughter Walter that some bad 
men were coming to murder daddy in his bath, and she in­
structed Walter to shout Robespierre’s name when the bad men 
arrived. But Walter, alas, had been sea-bathing that morning 
on the Riviera, and she had come home loaded with sea shells 
and salt water taffy, and when the bad men came to murder 
Robespierre, Walter, alas, was chewing a big wad of salt water 
taffy and could not get her mouth open in time to shout a 
warning. Robespierre, alas, was murdered quicker than you 
could shout Jacques Robespierre (or Jack Robinson as he is 
called in the English-speaking countries).
(There is, I am pleased to report, one small note of cheer in 
this grisly tale. When Georges Sand got to Majorca where 
Chopin was setting lyrics to his immortal “Warsaw Concerto,” 
she was happily able to help him find a rhyme for “Warsaw,” 
as everyone knows who has heard those haunting lyrics:
In the fair town of Warsaw,
Which Napoleon’s horse saw, f 
Singing cockles and mussels, alive alive o!)
But I digress.
We were speaking of Christmas gifts. What we all strive to do 
at Christmas is, of course, to find unusual, offbeat, different 
gifts for our friends. May I suggest then a carton of Marlboro 
Cigarettes?
What? You are astonished? You had not thought of Marlboros 
as unusual, offbeat, different? You had regarded them as familiar, 
reliable smokes whose excellence varied not one jot or tittle 
from year to year?
True. All true. But at the same time, Marlboros are unusual, 
offbeat, different, because every time you try one, it’s like the 
first time. The flavor never palls, never gets hackneyed. Each 
Marlboro is a fresh delight, a pristine pleasure, and if you want 
all your friends to clap their hands and exclaim, “Yes, Virginia, 
there is a Santa Claus!” you will put them at the very top of 
your Christmas list. © ]M0 wu
And for further Yuletide joy, give Marlboro’s nonfiltered 
companion cigarette, mild, flavorful Philip Morris—in regu­
lar size or the sensational neu' king-size Commander. You’ll 
be welcome E board O

Taders Write
Research Is Not 
Overemphasized 
Says Grad Student
May I take exception to your 
views as expressed in the editor­
ial of the last issue of the Tartan, 
r“ Dm what I gather from your 
rather wordy diatribe, you feel that 
the faculty -student relationship 
(outside the classroom) is being 
hampered here at Tech. You con­
demn research at Carnegie Tech, as 
well as presentations of technical 
papers and meetings of academic 
and professional societies that 
“rob” the faculty of - time better 
spent with the students. Would 
you have each faculty member 
^‘jcard his research and open his 
onice to all comers, at all times, 
remarking, “State your name and 
case?’ No, I think not.
“Madame” Editor, it is obvious 
that you are sincerely perplexed 
by the problem of poor student- 
faculty relations (if such a prob­
lem actually exists), and are just 
completely misinformed and are 
thus using incorrect arguments.
.u0UU cSDU0sO&nSLA
Basically, Carnegie Tech has 
three undertakings: 1. Under­
graduate education, 2. Graduate 
education, 3. Research. Ideally 
they should be equally viewed 
and an equal effort should be de­
voted to each. You advocate re- 
• ducing the time spent on re­
search or perhaps you would cut 
it out completely. But what does 
research do? 1. Most research in 
this country is done' in schools. 
3— is these advances in the sci­
ences, in math, in physics, in all 
the branches of engineering that 
rejuvenate and give impetus to 
industry and the various profes­
sions. Cut out research and the 
college graduate will find no place 
in industry. No new methods will 
be devised; no new jobs or op­
portunities will appear.
2. In this age of rapidly ad­
vancing technology, each member 
NBR the faculty engages in some 
sort of research, attends technical 
meetings, listens to and presents, 
himself, technical papers, so that 
he will not become stagnant and 
worthless as an educator in ten 
years.
3. Research is a source of in­
come that makes possible finan­
cial assistance to students.
4. The publication of profound 
and meaningful information as a 
rpsult of E research grant gives 
pvominence to a schol. More and 
better qualified students and fac­
ulty are drawn to such a school.
.vv gy2u —UAUO02u
There can never be too much 
research unless it begins to usurp 
time and effort from the other 
two fields of endeavor of a col­
lege or university. This is far 
from the case here at Tech.
Faculty - student get - togethers 
are a fine thing and I do agree 
t0t the resulting exchange of 
views is a part of a college edu­
cation. But the primary function 
of an institute of higher learning 
is formal education. Classroom 
lectures and laboratory experi­
ments educate the student. Re­
search keeps the faculty aware 
of present day developments, thus 
educates them and makes them 
better instructors. Erase or cur­
tail reserch and you bring civil- 
i.r.ion to a resounding HALT!
Fred Kosofsky, 
Graduate Student.

do so with confidence.” We as stu­
dents in the college do not believe 
this goal is achieved within the 
present department of General 
Studies.
As liberal arts students, we are 
led to believe that the curriculum 
presented to us would offer the 
wide scope of learning that its 
title connotes. However, as sopho­
mores, we have discovered that 
Margaret Morrison fulfills neither 
our hopes nor its aims.
5vS2USs0OsnvS
In the liberal arts program, we 
expected to be able to probe deep­
ly into one area of study, while 
still attaining a broad background 
and exposure to other areas. Al­
though we entered as English 
majors, we wished also to study 
history, philosophy, the social sci­
ences, natural sciences, and arts. 
Rather than studying them tech­
nically, we wished to gain knowl­
edge that courses outside the Eng­
lish department offered mainly 
technical knowledge and skills, 
without analysis of the goals in 
volved. Even in our own major, 
the courses were neither specific 
nor selective and did not give us 
opportunity to go deeply into sub­
ject matter of interest to us. For 
example, in our freshman chem­
istry course, we learned theory, 
laboratory procedure, and mathe­
matical application, but we did 
not learn the historic significance 
of chemistry or its effect upon 
modern society. Neither did we 
learn the relationship of one the­
ory to another. Then in English 
composition we were subjected to 
random placement with people 
who had no interest or aptitude in 
English. - The course presupposed 
no previous training in composi­
tion or breadth of reading. Those 
with extensive high school prepa­
ration were doing little more than 
repeating themselves and even 
those who proved themselves su­
perior during the first semester 
were given no recognition in the 
form of advanced work for the re­
mainder of the year.
by0JUY 5vy0AUA ^SwY
Within the English department, 
it is impossible to go beyond the 
level of a survey course in any 
period of English literature. Ex­
cept for the senior seminar course 
which discusses individual writers, 
there is no specific course other 
than Shakespeare available. In a 
liberal arts subject, this absence of 
selection is frustrating to anyone 
who wished to go beyond the in­
troductory level. Courses such as 
Russian literature, Readings in 
Satiric Literature, Milton ad in­
finitum are generally present in 
most colleges offering this major. 
Even in the catalogue, the bene­
ficial effects of such courses are 
acknowledged, for several are list­
ed though they are offered only 
sporadically or not at all.
Yet just because we are inter­
ested in these courses does not 
mean we wish to confine our in­
terests to only our own depart­
ment. We felt, for example, that 
¿here are many courses of value 
in the Fine Arts Department 
which give basic appreciation in 
aesthetics. Again the myth of the 
college catalogue says that such 
courses as History of Music, Aes­
thetics, and the Artist and History 
of Painting, Design, and Sculpture 
are open to Margaret Morrison 
students, but from experience, we 
have found that the struggle to 
enter the course almost obscures 
the thrill. The Fine Arts history 
requirement, History of Arts and 
Civilization, is a broader course 
than Western Civilization and its 
availability as a substitution

cerns for political and economical 
issues, they are not entirely suc­
cessful. If there were greater in­
tegration among courses the stu­
dent could then make these con­
nections better himself.
We have used English as our 
test case because we are most fa­
miliar with its program at Tech, 
but we do not feel our complaint 
is limited to ourselves and our 
own department. We have heard 
other students from other depart­
ments on the campus decrying the 
fact that they were refused ad­
mittance to courses' such as World 
Literature and Philosophy because 
of over crowded conditions. Cer­
tainly a greater abundance of 
courses offered both semesters 
would alleviate this problem. 
Then too, the realization of many 
students upon reaching their jun­
ior or senior year that they lack 
a background in the liberal arts 
indicates a narrowness of the 
standard curriculum.
But in spite of the diversity of 
our criticism, our basic dissatis­
faction lies within the General 
Studies department as such. We 
do not feel that the liberal arts 
should be treated in a technical 
manner. If within the basic phil­
osophy of Carnegie Tech, the 
course material cannot be 
changed, certainly its representa­
tion should be corrected, for then 
no student could complain, as we 
are, of being misled.

Happiness Is Undefinable
Currently showing at the Guild Theater is one of the 
finest foreign films I have seen in quite a while.
Prostitution seems all the rage in film industries every­
where. There are such things doing the rounds right now 
as “The World of Suzie Wong,”*
“Girl of the Night,” and like that.
The American products, of course, 
spend millions of dollars and doz­
ens (seemingly) of reels licking 
their chops over the whole thing, 
and tie up the whole thing very 
neatly with the girl in gallons of 
remorseful tears because of the 
“evil” nature of what she has been 
doing.
Thank God for people like Jules 
Dassin. Here is an American who 
wanted to say that happiness is 
not a thing that can be defined and 
administered by governments or 
philosophies, and had to leave his 
country and go to Europe to say 
it the way he wanted to. In Eu­
rope he was not saddled with 
“cautious” producers, distributors 
and publicity men who would wa*- 
ter down his script for fear of 
“offending” anyone at all. He 
could find the cast he wanted 
without any need to rely on box- 
office receipts as a guage of qual­
ity. (Under this latter system, he 
would undoubtedly have had to 
cast Elizabeth Taylor or Kim No­
vak as Illia, Rock Hudson as To- 
nio, and Burt Lancaster in the role 
Dassin himself played. But my 
mind is not made to encompass 
such infinite horror).
As it turned out, however, Das­
sin DnD make “Never on Sunday”
in Europe, and had a free hand 
with script, direction and casting. 
He proceeded to create a tender, 
raucous, poetic, earthy and alto­
gether beautiful and worthwhile 
work of film art.
b20nrs Px
The script was controlled and 
balanced. It holds something for 
everyone. Comedy, for those who 
love to laugh; symbols (profound 
and simple) for those who like to 
interpret; pathos, for those who 
like to cry; and even a scene from 
Euripides’ “Medea,” in the origi­
nal Greek.
The story is about the attempt­
ed “redemption” of a prostitute 
(magnificently played by Greek 
actress Melina Mercouri) by that 
highly dangerous and destructive 
force, the half-learned amateur 
“philosopher” and arm-chair 
“psychologist” (played just as 
magnificently by writer-director 
Dassin). The scene is in Piraeus, 
the wonderful port of Athens, 
where Dassin’s black-and-white 
camera finds more beauty than 
any three Cinemascope, color-by- 
D^Luxe machines in Hollywood.
The direction was near-flawless. 
Little more can be said about it. 
The camera work called attention 
to no single shot or composition, 
and yet gave an over-all impres­
sion of grace, rhythm and great 
technical sureness.
The bit players were almost all 
Greek, and I am led to believe 
from this picture that a great fu­
ture is in store for the Greek film 
industry, which, as yet, has only 
shown brief, if brilliant flashes of 
glory. I wish I had a complete 
listing of the names of the minor 
players. They deserve all the 
credit it is possible to give them. 
Music
I even give my complete ap­
proval to an element I usually try 
™ ^ v , , , . i to ignore. The title song is de-United States. Their education, is broadened not only b\ . lightful. But then, having many
academic work, but also through observations of American Greek friends, I am a sucker for

PERSONALITY
International 
Club President
Every year students from abroad come to study in the
life. C
Michael Scott Morton, a trans­
fer student at Carnegie from 
Glasgow University in Scotland, 
has noted the extreme “busyness” 
of all Americans—“they seem to 
lead such hectic lives.”
However, Michael, himself, 
leads a hectic life—even by 
American standards! As well as 
attending classes a^ a senior in­
dustrial administration student, 
Michael has also become involved 
in other Tech activities.
1SsU0SOsnvSOw 5wy6 V0UA’
One of these, the International 
Club, performs an important 
function on Tech’s campus by 
promoting understanding between 
foreign and American students.
Michael, president of the In­
ternational Club, feels that, “It 
is quite possible for foreign stu­
dents in America to become anti- 
American through neglect by 
other students and organizations 
on campus.” Therefore, becoming 
acquainted with American stu­
dents and working with them is 
an important part of the Inter­
national Club program.
Michael came to Tech in Feb­
ruary of 1959 after three semes­
ters at the University of Glas­
gow. In Scotland, Michael ob­
served, “more is left up to the 
student” than there is at Tech. 
The only exams were given at 
the end of a semester and there 
were no periodical assignments.
Before beginning at Glasgow, 
Michael, in accordance with the 
requirement for engineering stu-
dents, worked In Industry for a | 
year as a Rolls Royce student 
apprentice. He also received a | 
commission in the Royal Air 
Force for six months as a Pilot j 
Officer.
Rugby Player
An avid rugby player, Michael night Late Show is titled
Greek “bouzoukee” music from 
’way back.
If this column about “Never On 
Sunday” seems a trifle brief, it is 
because there are only so many 
superlatives in the English lan­
guage, and I hate to repeat myself. 
This film receives my highest rec­
ommendation.
Note: Channel four’s Tuesday
Le
saw his first football game last 
fall and found it “a confused mass 
of barbaric fighting.” Michael al­
so plays squash and cricket.
The Tech Drama Department 
productions are 'ound “enjoya- I 
ble” by Michael, and he, him-1 
self, has worked on the Scotch ’n 
Soda productions “Set ’em Up 
Again” and “On the Rocks.”

the semi-final round found TDP 
playing SAE “G” and ATO “A” 
facing SAE “P.” Unfortunately, 
this paper went to press too early 
to report these results.
In play last week, the quarter­
final round of the playoffs had 
ATO overcoming GSIA 15-13, j 
15-6. GSIA put up a fine effort in ! 
the first game but failed to come 
through with the clutch points. In 
the second game the ATOs team 
work provided more than enough 
to put the game away easily.
Another quarter-final game 
found TDP’s “A” team easily de­
feating SN 15-5, 15-7. The DTD’s"
offense was too much for SN to
handle. Led. by the setting and 
spiking of Carl Katz and Steve 
Rothenberg, the DTD’s walked 
away with both games.
SAE “G” put down a spunky
PKT team 15-11, in the third'
quarter-final game. The veteran 
SAE team was a little shaky in the 
first game but led by the spiking 
of Marv Buban and company, 
they came back to take the second 
game easily.
The battle for the fourth shot in 
the semi-finals was probably the 
closest match of the season. The 
scrappy TDP “G”. team vs. SAE 
“P” played “clutch” ball to come 
from behind to win 16-14, 17-15.
Earlier in the week the regular 
league play wound up with all the 
first seeded teams easily defeating

IS ON THE ROAD TO MANAGEMENT
Dick Cotton knew he wanted to take the 
engineering route into management long before 
he joined New Jersey Bell Telephone Company. 
In fact it was his goal When he was working for 
his engineering degree at Rutgers.
When he graduated, he had his lines out to 
eleven other companies. He came to New Jersey 
Bell because: “I didn’t feel I was just a number 
to these people. There was no doubt in my mind 
that this job would be the best for the long pull."
His first assignment was a tough one. A com­
plex of major telephone cables lay in the path of 
the approach to the new traffic level of the George 
Washington Bridge on the Hudson. Dick’s job 
was to find the most practical and economical 
way to reroute these cables, and at the same time 
to provide for future telephone growth in the 
area around the bridge approach.
Dick ironed that one out and got a crack at 
another tough job.
Next stop: New Jersey Bell Headquarters 
Engineering Staff, Special Studies Group. Here
Dick was a member of a four-man team whose 
job was to find ways to eliminate some of the 
routine work of field engineers to give them 
“more time to think.” Dick also helped plan 
and control a $100,000,000 annual telephone con­
struction budget.
Presently, Dick is responsible for telephone 
equipment engineering projects in the Camden, 
New Jersey, area.
How does Dick look at it? “This is a growing 
business. I work with this growth every day. 
And growth means more room at the top. Of 
course, I don’t figure I’ll get there overnight— 
but on my jobs so far I’ve had a chance to take 
a good look at how this business is run. And I 
think the sky’s the limit for a man who really 
wants to work for it.”
