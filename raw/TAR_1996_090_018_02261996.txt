Last Thursday, Club Wired’s 
Electronic Frontiers forum 
[www.hotline.com], with host 
Jon Lebkowsky, featured an 
online interview with Declan 
McCullagh, former CMU stu­
dent body president and a plain­
tiff in the American Civil Lib­
erties Union/Electronic Fron­
tiers Foundation court chal­
lenge to the Communication 
Decency Act (CDA).
An online activist, McCullagh 
is involved in the Justice on 
Campus Project and supports 
an anti-censorship mailing list, 
which also acts as an archive of 
published resources dealing 
with Internet censorship issues.
During the course of the in­
terview, various individuals 
and groups logged on while 
McCullagh provided informa­
tion on the progression of the 
hearings between the Depart­
ment of Justice and the ACLU/ 
EFF as well as minor updates 
on the Marty Rimm case, in 
which he played a role in expos­
ing Rimm’s lack of credibility. 
McCullagh also addressed 
other points and cases dealing 
with Internet censorship.
“By [Friday 1 morning we
should have a legally-binding 
written agreement with the 
[Department of Justice],” said 
McCullagh.
“They will agree not to pros­
ecute or investigate anyone ... 
under either the indecency or 
the patently offensive provi­
sions of the CDA,” he added. 
[Ed. Note: The ACLU has 
reached a tentative agreement 
wtih government lawyers giv­
ing computer network users 
temporary freedom from a 
clampdown in indecent mate­
rial on the Internet.]
McCullagh explained the de­
tails of the CDA, and the impli­
cations that would result un­
der the Act during the inter­
view.
“Note that if the decision 
goes against us, the Depart­
ment (^Justice (DoJ) will be 
able to prosecute based on the 
material that is online now,” 
he said, in response to com­
ments defined as indecent by 
the CDA that were directed 
by other users.
Online participants asked 
McCullagh to outline the le­
gal framework of the chal­
lenge for which he described 
the specific attacks against 
the act and the “figureheads” 
they will face during the trial.

A piece of evidence that most 
people thought would prove to be 
worthless has led CMU police to 
multiple arrests that few thought 
could happen. In the resolution of 
the Wean 5419 burglary, the piv­
otal roles were played by a screw­
driver one of the perpetrators 
dropped during his hasty escape, 
and a letter written by the thieves 
in a panicked attempt at damage 
control.
Chief of CMU police, James 
LaPaglia said at a press-confer­
ence last Wednesday that the 
quick resolution of the theft was 
accomplished, “using technology 
available here at the University 
and old-fashioned police work.”
Thursday morning, criminal 
charges were filed at Magistrate 
Tucker’s office in Squirrel Hill 
against Stephen May, an SDS 
sophomore and James Wang, a 
CIT junior, implicating them in 
not only the Wean burglary but 
also the two computer thefts at 
Cyert in September.
. A petition, was filed.last Friday 
..in.juvenile court against a third 
individual, a freshman MCS 
major, who was also alledgedly 
involved in these thefts. The in­
dividuals each face three counts 
of burglary — which as a second-
degree felony can carry a sen­
tence of up to 10 years imprison­
ment — criminal trespass, re­
ceiving stolen property, and crimi­
nal conspiracy.
According to LaPaglia, the 
screwdriver provided a significant 
lead in determining who had com­
mitted the theft. The tool was la­
belled with the name and phone 
number of an out-of-state com­
pany specializing in the installa­
tion of security systems. By con­
tacting the company, detectives 
learned that May had worked there 
for two summers. Although this 
allowed the detectives to name 
May as a suspect, it was not sub­
stantial enough to obtain a search 
warrant, much less one for arrest.
At this point, the second big 
break took place. LaPaglia said at 
the press conference, “A lot of 
things came together and they 
came together quickly.” In a move 
that has prompted much specula­
tion, the perpetrators mailed a let­
ter directed at Chief LaPaglia, to 
Campus Police and The Tartan.
The typed letter included accu­
rate information concerning not 
justthe^Wean theft, but two other 
incidents of computer burglar­
ies. CMU police determined that 
the letter was authentic because, 
according to LaPaglia, “it con­
tained information that only the 
thief would know.” When asked
why the letter had been sent, 
LaPaglia said, “I think they were 
scared by all the media atten­
tion.... They knew the pressure 
was on. The letter was meant to 
throw [Campus police] off.”
While the descriptions of the 
crimes were accurate, the letter 
had been written to confuse the 
identity of the perpetrators. Spe­
cifically, it said that only one per­
son, a senior living off-campus, 
was involved. In actuality, none 
of this turned out to be true.
According to LaPaglia, the
letter’s contribution to the investi­
gation was rather simple — the 
campus mail address on the back 
had been handwritten. Campus 
Police obtained a writing sample 
from May and confirmed that it 
the writing on the back of the 
letter. At this point a search war­
rant was obtained.
Upon entering the suspect’s 
Mudge House room, security found 
not only some of the stolen mer­
chandise but also e-mail between 
May and a company in Texas which

General Motors Vice President calls for organizational diversity
By SHANNON GIBNEY
Tartan Contributing Editor
“I can tell you from personal experience 
that boardrooms across America now re- 
j alize there are compelling economic rea­
sons for opening wide the doors of oppor­
tunity to all people, of every ethnic, racial, 
and social background. [These] economic 
reasons ... are prompting companies to 
get off the dime on managing diversity,” 
said Roy S. Roberts, VP and General 
Manager of GM Trucks.
Roberts, the first African American to 
head a department of one of the big three 
i auto manufacturers, came to CMU last 
' Wednesday to give a speech entitled 
Must Do It — Why Organizations are 
i Managing to Keep Fit for Competition.”
The speech was sponsored by CMAP 
and took place at 6 pm in the Adamson 
Wing.
Roberts began the talk by stating that 
the national perception of diversity, and 
its importance, changed dramaticallywith 
the advent of affirmative action in the 
’60s. Since then, Roberts asserted, Ameri­
can economic spheres, including indus­
try, have changed dramatically in order 
to incorporate these ideas of diversity.
“Ten years ago affirmative action was 
considered a soft issue, something that 
wasn’t critical to the bottom line of any 
organization. [However] ... business ex­
ecutives viewed it, at that time ... as a 
restriction of their rights. As a result, it 
wasn’t given serious thought, beyond the 
ramifications of “none-compliance with
government regulation.” Today, we know 
that managing diversity has a significant 
impact on the bottom line,” said Roberts.
He added, “As companies downsize, 
and maximize profitability in a global 
marketplace, effective utilization of hu­
man resources has become the key to 
any company’s competitive advantage.”
According to Roberts, managing di­
versity is not a “feel-good policy to 
improve ... image” but an organiza­
tional strategy for survival as we en­
ter the next century and move towards 
a highly technological and global 
economy. Roberts added that the 
changing racial complexion of mod­
ern-day America should be a wake-up 
call to organizational leaders.
“[Currently], nearly one in every four
Americans is of African, Asian, Hispanic, 
or American Indian descent. In addi­
tion, the greatest influx of workers, about 
85 percent of the net growth, is coming 
from women, minorities, and immi­
grants. Clearly, we cannot afford to ex­
clude whole groups of people from our 
pool of resources, or from our target 
customer base, if we want to be global 
leaders in our business.”
Roberts said that his diversity in man­
agement philosophy is currently prac­
ticed at GM. Every executive at the 
company is assessed by measuring how 
these ideas about diversity are expressed 
by and within their staffs.
GM’s company strategy on managing 
diversity includes a new emphasis on 
marketing, which strives to accommo­
date many different consumer groups, a 
human relations management element 
“designed to allow each person to realize 
his or her full potential,” a supplier de­
velopment component to “help minority 
suppliers increase their share of GM 
business,” and a community relations 
component which offers women, minori­
ties, and children mentoring and schol­
arship opportunities.
Roberts said, “You and I know that a; 
piece of paper’s one thing, changing atti­
tudes is quite another. Let me say that 
establishing a diversity policy is the only ; 
way that we’re going to create account- ; 
ability for results, and thereby begin the' 
necessary cultural change that we must , 
have in GM, and ... in this nation.”

Former Black Panther speaks
By CHRIS CANNON
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Thursday, Regi Newton enter­
tained, educated, and enlightened nearly 
60 students that crammed into West 
Wing’s TV room. At 7 pm, Morewood RA 
Catherine Marquis, who organized the 
event, made a general in­
troduction and began 
“Passin’ it on,” a video 
documentary about the 
Black Panthers.
Newton’s talk, “Separat­
ing Myth from Reality” 
was more of a preach than 
a lecture. His purpose for 
coming to campus was for 
students to gain a better understanding 
of the social and historical contexts in 
the formation of the Black Panther Party 
and to discuss the short and long-term 
objectives of the Party.
However, first Newton distinguished 
between the myths and the realities of 
the Party. He pointed out that it is not 
anti-white, saying that their member­
ship include d Asians, N ative Americ ans, 
Hispanics, and even some white sup­
porters.
Another myth is that the Panthers are
violent. Newton explained that “most 
sophisticated organizations have a mili­
tary wing and a non-combatant wing” 
and that he participated in the latter. 
The Panthers were just more versatile 
than other civil rights organizations. 
Newton added, “Malcom [X] taught us 
that it’s either the ballot or the bullet.”
As the documentary and Mr. Newton 
would later explain, the Black Panther 
Party for Self-Defense was founded by 
college students in Oakland, California 
in 1966. Newton compared the Panthers 
to gangs such as the Bloods and Crips 
because they wore colors, targeted black 
youths, and were not opposed to mili­
tant resistance, but he emphasized a 
key difference.
As a political party, The Black Pan­
thers had a political agenda. Party 
founders adopted a Marxist-Leninist
in West Wing
ideology and tried to sell Socialism. The?, 
party wanted to become a political leader : 
in the black community, provide public^ 
service, and “win the hearts and minds 
of the people,” in order to sell their ide­
ology, according to Newton. They wanted 
to complete structural changes that had;; 
already begun — especially involving 
the black community.
Newton wished to empha­
size the strengths and weak­
nesses of the party. The Black 
Panthers offered a strong com-, 
munity organization, pro­
moted unity and a sense of 
“good citizenship,” at least 
while on-duty and in the Afri­
can American community/- 
Community service programs included 
free housing, breakfast for children, 
health clinics, and clothing programs. 
Later, the Panthers organized voter 
registration drives.
Glaring weaknesses that Newton rec­
ognized were atheism and the 
leadership’s poor understanding of how 
one adopts and changes ideologies for 
one’s own cause. These factors, as well 
as public profanity, contributed to a gen­
eral lack of a “spiritual core” which is

Former NSA employee caught spying for KGB
PHILADELPHIA Feb 23(AP) — A 
former Army employee of the superse­
cret National Security Agency was ar­
rested by the FBI Friday on charges of 
spying for the former Soviet Union in 
the 1960s and ’70s in return for cash. 
Robert Stephan Lipka, 50, who worked 
for the NSA in 1964-67, was arrested 
at his home in Millersville, Pa., Jus­
tice Department spokesman John 
Russell said. FBI spokesman Bill 
Carter said Lipka was charged with 
transferring classified documents to 
the Soviet Union. The formal charge 
against Lipka said he worked with 
more than three confederates, of whom 
three were named, but none were 
charged. An affidavit by FBI agent 
John W. Whiteside III identified the 
alleged confederates as an East Ger­
man emigre couple, Peter Karl Fischer 
and Ingeborg Else Dora Fischer, and 
Artem Petrovich Shokin, a Soviet citi­
zen employed at the United Nations in 
New York from 1965-70. He said 
Fischer and Shokin were KGB agents 
and Mrs. Fischer was helping her hus­
band spy.
Whiteside makes clear that the FBI 
hadbeen trailingthe Fischers and eaves­
dropping on their home conversations 
during the late 1960s. As an NSA em­
ployee, Lipka had access to intelligence 
communications and code-word level 
clearance, according to one Justice offi-
cial, who declined to be identified by 
name. Usingreceivingstations around 
the world and satellites, the NSA eaves­
drops on foreign communications, 
breaks codes of foreign countries, and 
creates the codes that secure U.S. com­
munications. Lipka, who used the code 
name “Rook,” sold secrets to the former 
Soviet Union from 1965 to 1974, ac­
cording to an arrest warrant filed this 
morning by the FBI. He and a Soviet 
agent identified only as “Ivan” used to 
meet and play chess, the warran tsaid.
Lipka allegedly passed the docu­
ments to the Soviets during the 1960s 
when he was an Army enlisted man 
serving at the NSA, a Pentagon agency 
headquartered at Fort Meade in Mary­
land, a federal law enforcement offi­
cial said. According to the FBI arrest 
documents, Lipka told an unnamed 
witness in conversations in 1966 and 
1967 “that he was taking things from 
NSA and selling them to the Rus­
sians and had been doing so for a 
period of time.” Lipka stole the infor­
mation by photographing NSA docu­
ments with a small camera and hid­
ing documents in his clothing, the 
witness told the FBI. In the 1960s, 
Lipka told the witness he usually 
received $500 cash for each delivery 
of information, but the witness re­
members two occasions where Lipka 
said he received $1,000.
Dole continues political 
attack on Buchannan
WILSONVTLLE, Ore. Feb 23(AP) — 
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole (R.- 
Kansas) brushed aside appeals by con­
servative Republicans that he tone down 
his criticism of Pat Buchanan and 
pressed his attack Friday on the “ex­
treme views” of the con- ------------------
servative commentator.
Speaking to a group of 
employees at a high-tech 
electronics company,
Dole gave no indication 
that he had changed his 
basic campaign ap­
proach — despite some 
subtle adjustments in 
his wording.
“I consider my self to be a mainstream 
conservative and I tliink there’s a dif­
ference between mainstream andbeing 
extreme,” Dole said, in a clear reference 
to Buchanan.
The day before, several conservative 
Republicanleaders, including longtime 
Dole ally David Keene and Ralph Reed, 
director of the Christian Coalition, had
urged the campaign to stop casting 
Buchanan in such harsh terms to avoid 
alienating his supporters.
Dole aides said that the senator would 
refrain from specifically labeling 
Buchanan “an extremist.”
“I think there are views that 
he has that are borderline, 
and I intend to say so. ”
— Bob Dole
However, Dole continued to castigate 
Buchanan for “being on the fringe” and 
having extreme views. “I think there 
are views he has that are borderline 
and I intend to say so,” Dole said of 
Buchanan.
Asked about the advice from Keene 
and others, Dole said, “I don’t work for 
anybody in Washington. I’m the candi­
date. They’re not.”
Bosnian Serbs 
flee homeland
VOGOSCA, Bosnia-Herzegovina Feb 
24(AP) — The reunification of Bosnia’s 
torn capital began Friday on a chilling 
note. The Muslim-led government found 
a ghost town when it took control of this 
Serb neighborhood, most of its 24,000 
residents having fled rather than sub­
mit to enemy rule.
The remaining Serbs’ mistrust was 
immediately reinforced when Vogosca’s 
new rulers hoisted a Bosnian govern­
ment flag above a municipal building 
and stripped a Serb sign off the police 
station.
The Serb mayor said they also broke 
into his office, smashing pictures of Serb 
World War II heroes, rifling through 
desks, and kicking in doors. Making 
Sarajevo whole again is a key provision 
of the Bosnian peace agreement, and 
Vogosca was the first of the city’s five 
Serb districts to be handed over to the 
Muslim-Croat federation that is to gov­
ern half of Bosnia.
But egged on by their leaders’ warning 
that the government would take revenge 
for the Serbs’ long siege of the city, an 
estimated 20,000 residents of Vogosca 
fled for other Serb-held land this week. 
In trucks, cars, horse-drawn carts, and 
on foot, they took along everything they 
could carry, from pieces of their houses 
to dug-up bodies of loved ones.
The flight, expected to replay itself in 
other Serb districts of Sarajevo, did not 
bode well for wider efforts to reconstruct 
a normal society in war-shattered 
Bosnia.
The more Bosnia’s ethnic groups po­
larize into separate settlements, the 
greater is the likelihood that the state 
will split apart after NATO-led peace­
keepers leave.
When Muslim and Croat police en­
tered Vogosca to take control this morn­
ing, they were met by an eerie silence, 
broken onlyty angry shouts from some 
of the remaining Serbs as a Bosnian 
government flag was raised.
The hoisting of the flag—which is not 
a symbol of the federation — “was very 
ugly and unnecessary” the Serb mayor 
of Vogosca, Rajko Koprivica, told U.N. 
representatives who monitored the 
transfer. “This tragic incident further 
fueled the fears of remaining Serbs, who 
are now sure to go.” The sight of the 
Bosnian fleur-de-lis flag and green uni­
forms were too much for some of 
Vogosca’s remaining residents to bear. 
Nadica Matic was one of about 40 Serbs 
milling around four evacuation buses 
parked outside the building where the 
flag went up. “We’re horrified at the 
sight. The first bus I can load on and I’m 
out,” Matic said.
Minutes before the flag hoisting, 
Bosnia’s interior minister, Avdo Hebib, 
had told any Serbs who would listen that 
they should stay, and promised they 
would not be hurt.
The NATO-led peacekeeping force in 
Bosnia also insisted that the Serbs had

nothing to fear. In Vogosca, it distrib­
uted pamphlets saying: “Don’t believe 
the rumors! You can stay in your homes!” 
But the appeal went largely ignored. In 
a light snow, under the hazy morning 
sun, four buses were stationed in the 
center of Vogosca to evacuate the re­
maining Serbs.
But only a third of one bus was filled, 
mainly with older people, children and 
women. Ljubica Korica, 57, peered out a 
bus window and cried. “I don’t know 
where we will go. We have not done 
anything,” she said. Her husband sat 
next to her in silence, trembling. Vojka 
Skipina, 59, could not decide whether to 
leave.
“I packed all my things, they are at 
home,” she said. “But I can’t make up my

“He said: ‘Come, they will slaughter 
us.’ But I wasn’t afraid. Had I been, I 
would not have stayed. And I can always 
leave, can’t I?” she asked, looking around 
for confirmation.
China opposes 
free Taiwan
WASHINGTON Feb 23(AP) — The 
United States should take seriously 
China’s opposition to an independent 
Taiwan, a senior senator just back from 
China said today. Calling discord over 
Taiwan “the most dangerous” of many 
disagreements between Washington and 
Beijing, Senator Sam Nunn (D-Georgia) 
said Chinese leaders made clear to him 
they will not brook any drive toward 
independence on Taiwan.
“The Chinese leaders by their words 
and by their actions make it abundantly 
clear that any attempt by Taiwan to 
establish its independence from the 
mainland will result in a confrontation 
with the mainland,” Nunn said in a 
Senate floor speech. “It is clear that the 
Chinese do not desire a military clash, 
but it is also clear that they believe that 
their national sovereignty and their 
national pride are at stake on the ques­
tion of Taiwan’s future.”
Nunn, the ranking Democrat on the 
Senate Armed Services committee, trav­
eled to China last month for meetings 
with senior officials, including Presi­
dent Jiang Zemin. “Neither America nor 
Taiwan should take lightly this Chinese 
position,” Nunn said. “Beijing has drawn 
a firm line on this question.” Nunn’s 
broader point was that while Chinese 
policies do not always agree with U.S. 
preferences, China is emerging as a world 
power with which the United States 
must open dialogue at the highest levels 
to smooth out the relationship.
Pavarotti caught 
with secretary
ROME Feb 22(AP)— Superstar tenor 
Luciano Pavarotti says he has fallen in 
love with his 26-year-old secretary, and 
relations with his wife are “delicate,”
according to the Italian gossip magazine 
Chi. The weekly published photographs* 
of Pavarotti, 60, and Nicoletta Mantovani' 
while they were vacationing in Barba­
dos earlier this month.
The pictures show the celebrated tenoi 
and Mantovani strolling arm-in-arml 
swimming, and kissing on the beach. 
“Nicoletta is a young girl like all 
others I have. She’s one of my team,” 
Pavarotti is quoted as telling Chi. But 
Pavarotti added, “Nicoletta and I are 
very happy and it shows. Hiding or de­
nying it would be a crime.” The tenor is- 
not ready to make his relationship offr. 
cial, the magazine writes. “It’s not time 
yet: the situation is delicate,” Pavarotti' 
is quoted as saying.
Rumors that Pavarotti and his wife, 
Adua Veroni, are nearing divorce have- 
been circulating in the Italian media for; 
several months. The couple have been 
married 35 years. Pavarotti’s Modena' 
office, which is run by his wife, said it had 
no immediate comment on the report.Cuba shoots 
down exile pfane
MIAMI Feb. 24 (AP)—Cuban fighters 
Saturday reportedly shot down two 
planes belonging to a Miami Cuban ex­
ile organization, the Coast Guard said. 
The Coast Guard was searching inter­
national waters off Havana for four 
people who were on board the Brothers1 
to the Rescue planes, said Lt. Cmdr. 
Mark Woodring. A third plane in the. 
group was not shot down. Woodring could ' 
not confirm that the planes had been' 
shot down.
He said the Federal Aviation adminiS' 
tration made the report to them. Calls' 
placed to the FAA seeking confirmation 
were not immediately returned. 
Woodring didn’t know if the planes had 
flown over Cuban territory. He said the 
area where the Coast Guard was search­
ing was north of the 12-mile limit in' 
international waters. Further informa­
tion was not immediately available.

50 YEARS AGO, Feb. 26,1946: 
Student Council hosted an un­
successful dance.
On Friday night, February 22, 
Student Council sponsored a 
Freshman Mixer in Thistle Hall.
The dance, much to their dis­
appointment, was not a success. 
Not only did few students at­
tend, but they also danced very 
little.
Although scheduled until one 
o’clock, the dance ended at twelve. 
Student Council held this Mixer 
so that the new engineers and 
veterans could become ac­
quainted with some of the girls 
on campus.
25 YEARS AGO, Feb. 25, 
1971: “The Corner Counter 
Drugstore” was established to 
service the needs of C-MU’s stu­

room adjoining C-Tower in 
Morewood Gardens.
“The Corner Counter Drug­
store” was operated and man­
aged by work-study students. 
Set up as a non-profit experi­
ment, the store was subject to 
administrative review, and its
future was to be determined by 
volume of business and student 
response.
TEN YEARS AGO, Feb. 18, 
1986: Plans for a new univer­
sity center were started. Presi­
dent Cyert and board members 
placed it as their number one 
priority with two committees 
set up to discuss the details of 
the idea.
The project was estimated to 
cost $8.2 million and include a 
complete renovation of Skibo with 
the addition of26,000 square feet.
This space was tentatively al­
lotted for meeting spaces, the 
bookstore, the post office, and 
new offices for student organi­
zations.
Also, a 100,000 square foot fit- 
ness-recreation center was to be 
added, comprised of a multi-pur­
pose gym area, jogging track, 50 
meter pool, and more all at the 
estimated cost of $12.8 million. 
Two committees were set up to 
decide the details related to the 
center, which was to open in May 
of 1987.

claimed that the troops were do­
ing a great job, and that the forces 
had completed all of their first- 
day objectives for the ground cam­
paign.
Preliminary reports from the 
battlefield showed the Iraqis
hardly putting up a fight, and 
more than 5,000 Iraqis had been 
captured.
Schwarzkopf would not say how 
long the war would last save that 
the fighting would continue until 
the Iraqis got out of Kuwait.
Iraqi radio, however, claimed 
that there had been fierce fight­
ing and that the allied offensive 
had “failed utterly.”
Saddam Hussein warned that 
he would unleash chemical and 
biological warfare, but 
Schwarzkopf assured that there 
had been no such warfare as of 
yet.

In implementing this plan for man­
aging diversity, GM’s marketing divi­
sion is currently striving to incorpo­
rate the needs and concerns of many 
different communities into its (mar­
keting) strategy.
He added that the best answers in 
marketing, and in business in general, 
are achieved through examining a 
wealth of perspectives.
Ultimately, organizational leaders 
must take it upon themselves to create 
this environment of varied perspectives, 
in Roberts’ view.
‘The leaders will be held accountable 
for creating a system in which our people 
are empowered to participate, and to make 
decisions. Managing diversity cannot be 
delegated. It starts at the top. That means 
not just system changes, but mind-set 
changes as well.”
One of the most efficient system 
changes that a company can make, said 
Roberts, is distributing all'information 
and resources equally. Roberts said that, Roberts.
Grime and Incident Report
unless people are 
monetarily compen­
sated or penalized, 
they tend to stick 
with those who are 
like them. Therefore, 
the most important 
knowledge is sus­
tained by the group 
with the most power 
and influence in the 
company. “This 
group is traditionally 
composed of white 
males,” said Roberts. 
Roberts added that 
a good way to gain 
access to this knowl­
edge and power, is 
mentoring.
“Throughout my 
career, I have been 
the first black in every position I’ve 
held for 35 years. There were no black 
role models on my way up the ladder. 
If it weren’t for white Anglo-Saxon 
males, who were willing to give me 
their time and insights, I probably 
wouldn’t be who I am today. So my 
words are not about Anglo-Saxon male 
bashing .... I’m talking about enlarg­
ing the pie and selecting the brightest 
and best and giving diversity a thought 
so you can win,” said Roberts.
In addition to his speech, Roberts also 
discussed diversity and work issues with 
CMAP students earlier that afternoon, 
in the CMAP complex.
“I had a great time with the students 
this afternoon—up-close and personal... 
young people tend to have such energy 
and drive ... along with a healthy dose of 
cynicism about the status quo, that we all 
need to keep us humble. I also saw a lot.of 
optimism, for their own personal futures 
and that’s excellent and justified,” said

The victims of police brutality and 
their loved ones spoke out two Satur­
days ago at a conference held at CMU. 
At a conference sponsored by the Po­
litical Speakers Forum Board Thurs­
day night, the police perspective on 
brutality was given.
Police power and citizens’ rights 
were the two topics covered at this 
lecture coordinated by Bill Moran, a 
senior social and decision sciences 
major.
“I am interested in conflict resolu­
tion, and I wanted this lecture to 
provide a forum to deliver 
information from the civil 
rights activists’ and police 
officers’ perspectives,” he 
said.
The two speakers were 
Robert C. Swartzwelder, a 
court-certified expert wit­
ness on the application of 
lethal and non-lethal force 
and on police training 
practices, and Attorney 
Paul D. Boas, a Pittsburgh 
criminal defense lawyer 
who has been involved with a num­
ber of civil rights cases. The two 
spoke candidly about the absence of 
proper police training and the lack 
of support from the law enforcement 
institution.
Swartzwelder, who also testified for 
the defense at the Jonny Gammage 
trial, cited the lack of adequate, up-to- 
date police training as the major rea­
son for police brutality today.
“Police are being trained using a 
reference restraint manual from 1985, 
but cops must live up to the [external]
circumstances of 1995,” he said. “[Po­
lice] learn things in a static environ­
ment that they have to apply 
situationally. [They are not taught] how 
to solve a problem that takes place in 
externality.”He also added that the only 
qualification needed for police to keep 
carrying a gun is to shoot once a year at 
a shooting range, and that there is no 
annual re-certification for non-deadly 
force.
According to Swartzwelder, one rea­
son for this lack of adequate training is 
because those who want to learn new 
training are “hampered” by the institu­
tion.
“To train one person at a top-of-the-
“If they hadn't pulled him over be­
cause he was black and driving a 
Jaguar... we might not have had a 
situation with three, four; five guys 
on his back. ”
— Attorney Paul Boas
line training center would cost 3,000 
dollars. This person could then train 
the rest,” he said. But he added that 
there is no support for this kind of 
action within most law enforcement 
agencies.
Attorney Paul Boas, a practicing crimi­
nal defense lawyer of 24 years dealing 
mainly with civil rights, said there is a 
point where he doesn’t think training 
can be the only answer to the problem of 
police brutality.
“There is a certain amount of account­
ability police officers have to take,” he
said. “It’s important to force police to 
know we’re out there as their account­
ability ... there’s someone out there 
watching them.”
With regard to the Jonny Gammage 
trial, Swartzwelder said, ‘This is a 
case of failure to train causing the 
tragic death of a person ... it is inevi­
table with [training] the way it is now, 
that the situation will be repeated.”
Boas countered, “If they hadn’t 
pulled him over because he was black 
and driving a Jaguar in Brentwood, 
then we might not have had a situa­
tion with three, four, five guys on his 
back.”
Preston K. Covey, associate pro­
fessor of philosophy 
and director of the 
Center for the Advance 
of Applied Ethics was 
also in attendance at 
the lecture.
“The whole concept 
[of this lecture] was, 
we know there was this 
incredible tragedy of 
Jonny Gammage’s 
death ... and against 
——— the background of all 
the hard feelings from 
the family and Police Department, 
let’s give the audience the facts from 
two points of view, not just one,” he 
said.
Covey also expressed anger at the 
poor attendance of the lecture, which 
included roughly 25 people. “Where 
are the people from the conference 
two Saturdays ago? Where are the 
rest who were so concerned?” he said.
Covey invited those students who did 
attend the lecture to meet wtih him 
afterward and continue discussing the 
issues raised at the conference.
2/19 MEDICAL, 11:29am. An 
officer was dispatched to the 
Mellon Institute to attend to an 
injured employee. She had 
tripped over a box in the attic, 
injuring her wrist. She was trans­
ported to West Penn hospital.
2/20 CRIMINAL MISCHIEF, 
4:46am. An officer was dis­
patched to Porter Hall to take a 
criminal mischief report from a 
CPS employee. Apparently, two 
CPS custodians had attempted 
to pry a vent off a door to get into 
a'store room.
2/20 MEDICAL, 8:17am. While 
cleaning the meat sheer, a High­
lander employee mistakenly sliced 
her finger. She was transported to 
West Penn Hospital.
2/20 TERRORISTIC 
THREATS, 9:31am. An employee 
had threatened to bring a gun to 
campus, so campus police were 
called in on standby while she was 
released from her position.
The employee entered the 
building and was confronted by 
two officers. They explained that 
since she had threatened to bring 
a weapon onto campus, her em­
ployment was terminated. Al­
though she repeatedly claimed 
that she had been joking, cam­
pus police said that such a threat 
must be assumed to be serious in 
order to maintain a safe work­
place. She took her things and 
agreed not to return to CMU.
2/21 MEDICAL, 10:30pm. 
Campus police and student EMS 
were dispatched to Morewood 
Gardens after a student got dust 
in her eye. EMS washed her eye 
out with an eye solution.
2/23 ROOF VIOLATION, 
1:16am. While exiting Posner 
Hall, two officers observed two 
students on the roof of the Mar­
garet Morrison Rotunda.
With the students under obser­
vation, four other officers were dis­
patched to issue the students 
citations.
The Tartan prints the weekly 
Crime and Incident Report un­
der the following guidelines:
• Campus Police. Chief James 
LaPaglia reviews all reports 
prior to release.
•Only three people on The Tar­
tan staff see the reports: the Edi- 
tor-in-Chief the News Editor, 
and the staffwriter who types 
the report.
•All personal names of com­
plainants, victims, suspects, and 
fraternity names are omitted 
from the printed report. Ethnic 
descriptions and other personal 
details are given only in the con­
text of a complete description.
•Not every incident that oc­
curs on campus appears in the 
report.

CMU police apprehend three students
BTm•Bp tsbi lCau c
had been purchasing the stolen 
merchandise. On the morning of 
the press-conference, another room 
had been searched yielding more 
of the stolen computers and com­
puter parts.
LaPaglia said that he purchas­
ing company in Texas, which has 
been helping CMU police recover 
the material already sold, claimed 
they did not know the material 
was stolen. Though Chief LaPaglia 
admitted that this is certainly a 
possibility, he said, “If you ask me 
my opinion, I think they know.”
The trio also sold some of their 
merchandise to other students 
on-campus. LaPaglia said CMU 
police have determined that none 
of the receiving parties knew the 
material had been stolen. These 
students have cooperated in re­
turning the goods.
May, Wang, and the freshman 
have also been helping in CMU 
security’s efforts to. recover the
property sent to the purchasing 
firm in Texas. LaPaglia said, 
‘They are cooperating.”
The monetary value of all the 
stolen property has been deter­
mined as $87,000 from the first 
Cyert incident in September, 
$9,000 from the second Cyert in­
cident, and $19,000 from the most 
recent Wean incident.
The three students will be fac­
ing University disciplinary action 
in addition to the criminal and 
juvenile charges. Michael Murphy, 
Dean of Student Affairs, was un­
sure of the exact course to be taken 
at that time because, “We don’t 
know precisely the culpability of 
each of the students involved.” 
Murphy indicated that expul­
sion is a serious possibility and 
expressed sadness that the accused 
perpetrators turned out to be 
students. “Its obviously 
dissappointing when a member of 
the community takes advantage 
of the climate of trust,” he said.
Speculation has abounded as to 
the motive behind the trio’s crimes. 
May has had financial problems 
and had to cut a semester short at 
one point because he could no 
longer afford to attend. However, 
according to LaPaglia, “[The mo­
tive] appears to be a combination 
of things, not just the money but 
also the thrill of it.”
LaPaglia said on Thursday that 
the suspects’ families have been 
contacted. “They are all getting 
the support of their families, 
which is important,” he said.
The letter, which the trio wrote 
as an attempt at disinformation, 
not only helped to convict them 
but also included a message to 
the rest of the CMU community.
It read, “I would like to make a 
suggestion to my fellow CMU stu­
dents. Please do not attempt any 
adventure of this sort. The pay­
off certainly is not worth the risk 
unless you are willing to do the 
time for your crime’”

SDC hosts regional conference
W. LAUREN HEINZ
Tartan Contributing Editor
The Student Dormitory Council 
hosted more than 30 colleges and 
universities at the Hampton Inn 
this weekend for a regional confer­
ence for which the organization 
has spent the last two years pre­
paring.
The ‘Mini/No-Frills Conference”
— an annual meeting of the Cen­
tral Atlantic Affiliate of American 
College and University Residence 
Halls (CAAA-CURH) — was at­
tended by more than 60 students 
from Pennsylvania, Delaware, 
Maryland, Ohio, New Jersey, and 
Washington, D.C.
The conference allows resi­
dence hall organizations such as 
SDC to address specific housing 
issues affecting their region be­
fore attending a national confer­
ence in May.
“We were very happy with the 
results. We always look for feed­
back so future schools can see what 
does and doesn’t work but I didn’t 
hear a negative comment,” said 
Austin Shifrin, assistant SDC 
chairman.
SDC was selected to host the 
conference at last year’s Mini/ 
No-Frills Conference at Ohio 
State University in Columbus, 
after submitting a proposal which 
detailed where the conference 
would be held, what programs 
would be offered and what events 
would be scheduled.
Carnegie Mellon was selected 
over two other universities and 
chose “Steeling the Spotlight” as 
the overall theme for the three-
day event.
“It’s fun to host a conference — 
for all the stress it puts us through
— because everyone is so enthusi­
astic,” said Mike Sperger, trans­
portation and security chairman. 
“We get to show other students 
our school and how our organiza­
tion works.”
Shifrin, a junior psychology 
major.
After the opening ceremonies, 
students attended meetings 
about the planning of the na­
tional conference or could go 
square-dancing in the Gym.
Starting at 7 am Saturday, 
participants attended various
"The conference gives us a chance 
to see what other residence hall 
associations are doing...”
—Mike Sperger; SDC representative
While the conference addressed 
issues such as security in the dor­
mitories, the weekend’s main fo­
cus was learning how to develop a 
successful and productive student 
organization through methods 
such as fund-raising, student mo­
tivation, and campus planning.
“Some of the residence associa­
tions are just getting offthe ground 
and haven’t learned how to do 
some of these things,” said Sperger, 
a sophomore professional writing 
major. “The conference gives them 
and us a chance to see what other 
residence hall associations are 
doing and then learn from these 
other experiences.”
During the opening ceremonies 
Friday night, Rick Miller, a mo­
tivational speaker from the Uni­
versity of South Carolina, spoke 
about the various pressures af­
fecting student organizations.
“Miller was very well received
— he was hysterical,” said
student presentations at the 
Hampton Inn and on campus. 
Murali Jatla of Case Western 
Reserve University in Cleve­
land, Ohio, talked about a Win­
ter Carnival/Spring Olympics .
— a sort of intramural sports 
tournament he created to re­
vive school spirit.
Christina Golden and Becca 
Young of the Catholic Univer­
sity of America in Washington, 
D.C., presented “The Rainbow 
Connection,” a plan they had 
for improving relations be­
tween resident assistants and 
dormitory councils.
The weekend climaxed Sat­
urday evening with a banquet 
and dance at the St. Nicholas 
Community Center on Craig 
Street, where awards for ex­
ceptional service were pre­
sented and the host for next 
year’s Mini/No-Frills Confer­
ence was announced.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
Black Panther Party discussed
hNGBTmep tsbi lCau c
needed “for any longevity in the 
African American community.” 
Also, the Black Panthers as a 
whole underestimated “the ve­
racity, viciousness, and out­
right murderous tendencies of the 
U.S. government.” Newton 
roughly estimates that “every 
third brother in the Black Pan­
ther Party for Self-Defense was a 
government agent.”
Later in the evening, Newton 
stressed the lessons that could be 
learned from the Black Panther 
legacy. He remarked that it was 
the first time in United States 
history that African American 
youths established a national or­
ganization. On a broad scale, stu­
dents and young people stood up 
as leaders in their community, 
attempting to change the quality 
of life.
Through his experiences as a 
Panther, and particularly the 
assassination of Martin Luther 
King Jr., he became aware of 
the existence of what many have 
and still consider a state of war. 
In his words the black experi­
ence in America is “known in 
military terms as a protracted 
war.”
Newton seemed to feel that not 
enough has been learned from 
the Panthers. He points to the 
general lack of unity in today’s 
young, professional black com­
munity. He also said that the 
media do not promote cultural 
events such as the Million Man 
March, led by Louis Farrakhan 
this past October 16, in which he
took part. He likened it to “a 
Black Woodstock.” According to 
Newton, the march was a day of 
atonement for being irrespon­
sible fathers, husbands, broth­
ers, and letting spiritual and cul­
tural unity dwindle.
After the talk, Newton engaged 
in a question-and-answer session 
that lasted more than an hour. 
Question topics included afjpr- 
mative action, the desire of a 
larger role for women in deter­
mining party ideology, what stu­
dents can do for themselves and 
others, and the need for a new, 
progressive, political black youth 
organization.
Sophomore CS major Grant 
Olds said that Newton “sees more 
what we need to do for ourselves 
than worrying about what 
others are doing.” Olds 
added that Newton was 
“very informative, to the 
point, more of a grass­
roots person.”
Marine Lance Cpl. 
Michael Hernton was one 
of many active, interested 
participants, and even 
helped with the Q&A. “I 
thought it was a good 
thing. Very rarely do you 
see an African American 
saying what we need to 
do.”
Organizer Marquis 
thought that the event 
went well, and she was 
impressed by the high 
turnout. Although origi­
nally it seemed that she 
wouldn’t be able to get a
speaker for the program, Mar­
quis was obviously pleased 
with the outcome. “People 
asked a lot of important ques­
tions and were really inter­
ested,” she said.
When asked if he could deliver 
a message to college youths in 
general, Newton urged “students 
to take the time to explore their 
rich history of organizing for 
social change,” and to realize 
that “students around the world 
historically have been at the fore­
front of social change.”
Newton teaches African 
American history at 
Duquesne University and 
serves as the associate direc­
tor of the Learning Skills Cen­
ter there.

CLIMB nominated for 
prestigious award
The Carnegie Mellon University Cen­
ter for Light Microscope Imaging and 
Biotechnology (CLIMB) has been nomi­
nated for a Computerworld Smithsonian 
Award. This award, established in1989, 
acknowledges the achievements of or­
ganizations, corporations, and individu­
als who create positive changes in soci­
ety through various fields of informa­
tion technology.
CMU’s nomination was due to the 
center’s innovative utilization of imaging 
technology in the field of light microscopy. 
Because of these efforts, the center offers 
biomedical researchers effective ways for 
understanding cells, the effect drugs have 
on cells, and how cells become cancerous.
Judges will select five finalists and 
one winner in each of 10 categories at 
the end of April. The winners will be 
announced on June 3 at a dinner in 
Washington, D.C.
GSIA hosts conference
CMU’s Graduate School of Industrial 
Administration hosted a panel discus­
sion on the “Future of U.S. Steel Indus­
try” last Friday. Dr. Richard Cyert was 
the moderator for the discussion and 
introduced the panelists including David 
Roderick, former USX CEO; Paul 
Wilhelm, CMU alumnus and president 
of U.S. Steel; and Richard Fruehan, a
CMU professor and director of the Cen­
ter for Iron and Steelmaking Research.
The panelists described the industry 
as dynamic, having new challenges each 
decade. After major reconstruction, the 
industry became a “major player.”
Currently, the industry faces techno­
logical challenges.“The U.S. has been 
playing catch- up in technology for years. 
However, this is not the case anymore; 
we are now leaders in some areas,” 
Fruehan said.
CMU Escort Service 
changes pickup policy
On Tuesday, March 5, the escort ser­
vice will institute a “designated” pickup 
scheme. Under the new policy, there 
will be four designated pickup locations, 
each equipped with a campus telephone. 
These areas will be Morewood Gardens 
(E-Tower parking lot), Margaret 
Morrison Plaza (MMP storefronts), 
GSIA (the corner of Tech and Frew 
Streets), and Porter Hall (Lower Frew 
Street exit).
These changes will only be effective 
from 6:30 pm to 2:30 am Sunday through 
Thursday and 6:30 pm to 4:30 am Fri­
day and Saturday. Riders are encour­
aged to call the Escort Dispatch Office 
(x8-2333) for further information.

“Does everyone understand that this 
is about applying a broadcast stan­
dard to the Internet?” said host Jon 
Lebkowsky, reinforcing McCullagh’s 
stance.
“A broadcast standard has to do 
with indecency, not obscenity,” he 
added.
As the conversation topics advanced, 
some online users geared their ques­
tions towards McCullagh’s knowledge 
of theMarty Rimm scandal.
While the ethics and reliability of the 
Rimm study are still in question, said 
McCullagh, the DoJ found it resource­
ful in their argument.
“For the latest on Marty: Marty Rimm 
is no more.' He’s 
changed his name le­
gally,” said McCullagh. 
“No word on what the 
new one is.”
“This is interesting 
[because] CMU is still 
investigating his ethi­
cal misconduct and 
could (possibly) yank 
his degree... [and] the 
DoJ attached his 
“study”.as an exhibit 
in their response to 
our complaint, and 
cites it in their brief,” 
he added.
McCullagh said 
that the DoJ will use 
the Rimm study to 
misinterpret the 
meaning of indecent 
as opposed to obscene. 
“There is a long list of 
newsgroup sites
called alt.binaries and alt.sex where 
erotic pictures... can be downloaded...” 
he said.
To those asking for more information 
about web-page censorship, McCullagh 
directed them to his web site which 
holds a published article he has written 
on the issue.
“I have a list of recent censorship at­
tempts, excerpted from a presentation 
I’m giving next month at the Comput­
ers, Freedom, and Privacy conference,” 
he said.
While McCullagh identified his in­
volvement with the EFF as “a volun­
teer and a co-web site maintainer,” his 
exact role in the Rimm study and in 
the Justice on Campus Project is not 
definite.
McCullagh received praise from those 
online for his efforts to fight censorship 
on the Internet. Said “Brian,” “My wife 
says we’re going to name our first child 
after [Declan].”

Skibo name embodies 
spirit and tradition
The Carnegie Mellon Univer­
sity Center, as the administra­
tion would have it called, will be 
opening in a few short months. 
The University Center will house 
a cafe to be known as the Skibo 
Coffeehouse. Our question is this: 
who are these new members of 
the community, and why aren’t 
they going by their old names, 
Skibo and Scotland Yard?
The name Skibo has been an 
institution on this campus since 
it identified a small soda foun­
tain that had been converted 
from a World War I tool shed.
The February 5,1946 issue of 
The Tartan told the early his­
tory of Skibo, and this was before 
the immediate predecessor of the 
University Center (Skibo V, as 
techites would have deemed it), 
was even a twinkle in its archi­
tect’s eyes. The article told the 
stories of Skibos I, II, and III, 
converted from a WWI tool shed, 
a WWI and WWII canteen, and 
hangar, storeroom and aviation 
laboratory, respectively.
The name Sldbo is one that is 
steeped with history and person­
ality, and has been the name of 
the meeting place for years. It is 
one tradition that cannot be al­
lowed to wither.
A committee formed to decide 
the fate of Scotland Yard appar­
ently realized the significance of 
this tradition. They decided that 
the Scotland Yard should be 
named the Skibo Coffeehouse. 
While this was a noble attempt 
to try to continue the tradition, it 
simply does not fit the bill. The 
reason why is two-fold.
First, as the University Center 
draws close to completion, admin­
istrators have begun to ask that 
students take a sense of pride in 
the building. This is pivotal to the 
success and life of the building. 
However, there is still an issue of 
ownership — many students still 
feel as though the University Cen­
ter is simply not theirs.
While it is meant to belong to
the entire campus community, 
we feel it is important to give the 
building an irrefutable identity, 
one that transcends sterile sand­
stone and tile. If the University 
Center were to be named Skibo, 
it would seem to be more of a 
campus institution than just 
some building that is designed 
for everyone to use. “The Skibo 
Coffeehouse” simply does not 
embody the history and tradi­
tion that the name Skibo has 
garnered on this campus.
Secondly, the name “Scotland 
Yard,” has become a tradition in 
its own right at CMU. Adminis­
trators cited that the name has 
very little significance histori­
cally speaking, and that The 
Sldbo Coffeehouse is just as suit­
able a name.
However, the situation is quite 
to the contrary. Traditions can­
not become traditions if they are 
killed when they are just seven 
years old, as is the name “Scot­
land Yard.”
Ask any older alumnus about 
the glory years at CMU, and they 
will tell you of an age rich in 
tradition, spirit, and school pride 
(emotions that are lacking at 
modern-day CMU). These were 
the years when Carnegie Tech 
Football beat Notre Dame in a 
capacity-filled stadium.
Many of the traditions of those 
days are gone now, because they 
have been forgotten and killed 
off. How are we to restore pride 
and school spirit in our Univer­
sity if we fail to establish and 
practice the traditions that make 
us unique? Furthermore, how can 
we expect the students of 
Carnegie Mellon to take pride in 
a building called the University 
Center?
Traditions are not made of syn­
thetic names and titles, they are 
borne of history and pride, and 
are self-fulfilling in nature: the 
traditional name of a student 
union borne of pride gives birth 
to deeper pride and spirit.
Off-campus students 
need more attention
Each year a growing number of 
Carnegie Mellon students leave 
the crowded confines of campus 
housing for the surrounding 
neighborhoods. The advantages 
of non-University housing are 
numerous: your rooms are larger, 
there’s more privacy, you defi­
nitely get your own bathroom 
and the cost of housing is lower.
The Urdversity encourages this 
exodus in order to make room for 
the ever increasing size of each 
subsequent freshman class, but 
in the rush to get students off- 
campus, the University seems to 
forget these recently departed 
students.
Off-campus students have 
made the choice to move—they 
should not, nor do they, get the 
all of the perks of on campus life. 
The Housing and Residence Life 
Offices forget that off-campus 
students are also an integral part 
of on campus life.
The University regularly sends 
mail to the surrounding area 
under the “Good Neighbors” pro­
gram, attempting to establish a 
relationship with the

Animal transplants retard morality
dji
Matt Ball
Recently, NBC Nightly News ran an 
“in-depth” story about genetically engi­
neering pigs for “spare parts” for hu­
mans. Soon, pig livers, hearts, etc. will 
be transplanted into humans. During 
this report, a professor of bio-ethics 
stated that the possible use of pig parts 
is not an ethical concern for us, since “we 
eat animals, we hunt animals, and we 
exploit them for clothing.” Given that 
these activities are acceptable in this 
society, killing pigs in an attempt to 
“save” (extend) human lives must be
The logic is impenetrable. Although 
certain animal rights activists will offer 
arguments such as “optimal use of re­
sources” and “promote health instead of 
treating disease,” and point out that no 
inter-species transplant has ever proven 
successful, it is patently absurd to think 
that while it is acceptable to kill and eat 
another animal (thus harming human 
health) it could somehow be wrong to
kill and use an animal in an attempt to 
benefit humans, no matter how dubious 
the endeavor.
Although these conclusions are sound 
given the assumptions of ethics in soci­
ety today, other statements during the 
report hint that the premises are not 
infallible. The bio-ethicist concluded that 
if you want to stop animal abuse, you 
should begin your efforts in areas other 
than medical research. He also stated 
that it is “tragic” to have to kill the pig.
Thus, on the one hand, any use, abuse, 
and killing of other animals is accept­
able because it is done by society; on the 
other hand, it may be possible to want to 
fight “tragic” deaths of animals.
The contradiction seems readily ap­
parent, returning us to the most basic 
and yet unquestioned issue: the ethics of 
eating animals. Clearly, there are ter­
rible abuses and suffering inherent in 
today’s animal agriculture, culminating 
with the butchering of an individual, 
innocent, sentient being for the sake of a 
fleeting taste of flesh.
Instead of trying to build a case against 
vegetarianism and animal rights, as 
moral beings we must be able to build an 
ethical argument in favor of perpetrat­
ing this blatant, unnecessary, and de-
stmctive cruelty.
Some people toss aside morality and 
satisfy themselves with the underlying ; 
philosophy of “might makes right.” Once 
thè idea of morality is removed from the 
equation, there is no argument for or 
against eating animals, and one does 
whatever one pleases.
However, there are those who claim to 
be moral, who admit that the suffering 
and death of other animals is “tragic.” 
Yet thèse people continue to inflict these 
very gratuitous cruelties every day by 
what they choose to eat.
It is admittedly easier to turn our 
backs on the reality behind our “meat,” 
or choose some arbitrary level of cruelty 
that is unacceptable, or to toss off the 
concerns of animals as “relatively mi­
nor.” Yet none of these are actual de­
fenses of our actions. As long as we 1 
refuse to address the consequences of 
our choices and fail to develop a consis­
tent set of ethics, we are abdicating our 
moral capacity and denying our fullest 
potential.
Ball is a Ph.D. student in Environ­
mental Engineering.
He welcomes any tenable argument for 
killing and eating animals.
University’s neighbors. What the 
University fails to notice is that 
the recipients of the newsletter 
are often CMU students, since 
there are a large percentage of 
them in the immediate area. The 
administration is able find off- 
campus student’s addresses for 
the purposes of mailing bills, but 
seem unable to differentiate be­
tween occupants of the neigh­
borhood for other reasons.
Nearly 35 percent of CMU stu­
dents live off-campus—a num­
ber that is growing each year 
with the rising enrollment at 
CMU. The administration 
should make an effort to treat 
off-campus students as part of 
the general student body. Al­
though many off-campus stu­
dents live on streets that con­
sist of almost all CMU students, 
many have no idea who their 
neighbors are. If the Housing 
and Residence Life Offices could 
help coordinate community 
building events, such as a block 
party or a barbecue, the quality 
of off-campus life could be 
greatly improved.
Writer ruminates over today’s issues
What’s on my 
mind?
The golden age of 
detective drama oh 
the radio contrib­
uted two great 
phrases td the En­
glish language. The first is “to come on like Gangbusters,” a 
reference to the show of that name, which opened with the 
sounds of machine-gun fire and squealing tires.
The second is the saying, “Crime does not pay!” I bet our 
Computer Chip Bandits are thinking about that as they 
await their trials.
Criminals usually get tripped up by their own greed and 
cockiness. Our lads (one freshman, one sophomore, one 
junior) started out small, stealing $9,000 in computers from 
Cyert cluster. Then they stole the key to a storage closet and 
made off with $87,000 in memory chips, CPUs, and para­
phernalia.
But the piece de resistance was their Wean Hall caper, in 
which they tried to abscond with 47 chips valued at $19,000. 
only to leave a vital clue behind — one of them left behind a 
screwdriver imprinted with a company name that was 
traced back to him. This key piece of evidence led them to a 
group of three 
convictions.
The value of 
the stolen mer­
chandise alone 
should show that 
this was no mere 
prank. Other 
damage so far?
Some of the 
fenced chips will 
never be recov­
ered; students 
lost the use of a 
cluster until the 
machines were 
repaired; and the 
families and 
friends of the 
“perps” — and 
theUniversity— 
were embar­
rassed. But the 
worst thing
about this incident is that these guys stole from their fellow 
students. I’m as mad about this as if they had picked my 
pocket. And they had the nerve to write a snide letter to 
Campus Police bragging about their skill and adding that 
the cops would be off “getting coffee and donuts” while they 
robbed CMU blind! Who’s laughing now?
Congratulations to Campus Police for some fine detective 
work; now, I hope justice is done fairly and swiftly. At the 
very least, I think that these students should be expelled. 
Since they’re first-time offenders, I doubt they’ll do much 
hard time. When is the University going to wise up and 
install some electronic security in the clusters?
After all, motion detectors, heat sensors, and other meth­
ods are relatively inexpensive and readily available. Or do 
we have to get burned again?
Fool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me; 
fool me three times? Four?
Five?
What else..., The Republican Revolution started grind­
ing to a halt last week.
First, we found out that the new Congressmen, who 
vowed not to take money from special interest groups, 
have been taking it hand-over-fist at an unprecedented 
rate. Then, the New Hampshire voters annointed Pat 
Buchanan their choice for leader of the free world.
That would be the same Pat Buchanan who feels that 
women don’t have what it takes to succeed in the business 
world.
Who’d like to make sure that everyone feels welcome in 
this country, as long as they’re Anglo and Christian. Who 
wants to stop legal immigration for the next ten years. 
Whose former right-hand man (pun intended), Larry 
Pratt, helped inspire the militia movement.
Never mind that Pat the Mouth has about as much 
chance of being elected president as I do; his candidacy is 
a disaster for the GOP.
Once he gets to the convention and begins spouting his 
racist, pinhead rhetoric, Bill-Glinton and Congressional 
Democrats will be wetting their pants with glee. I suggest 
that those of you who were dancing on the grave of the 
Democratic Party a few months ago re-read what I just 
wrote about “cockiness.”

in the best shap^ 
they’ve been in 
years. They’re 
profitable, they’re

they have weli-

problem, however, is that all the lean years for America’s 
railroads led some of them to rip out their extra tracks, 
leaving some busy lines stretched to the a dangerous and 
often ignored breaking point. While most trains are now 
dispatched by computer, there’s not much room for error. 
When there are mistakes, the results can be disastrous, 
like the crash of the Capitol Limited with a commuter 
train in Maryland.
Fortunately, there aren’t many accidents. And if you’re 
still worried, here’s a comforting thought: You’re much 
more likely to die on your way to the station than you are 
on the train. Hmmm.... Maybe a Pat Buchanan presi­
dency might have a few bright spots. After all, Mussolini 
made the trains run on time; think of what Pat could do

Campus supplies students with taste of real life
Derek Robinson
CMU is unlike other univer­
sities. Sure, it is an excellent 
academic institution, one 
which I am overly proud to 
belong to. But whereas other 
colleges might make these four 
years of undergraduate work 
seem like another step in a 
person’s life, CMU does not 
differentiate between these 
two stages in one’s life at all. 
Being a student here is like 
entering an arena that follows 
the rules of the real world, 
without the danger inherent 
in the real world itself. Some 
might feel that this could 
hinder a student’s educational 
development, but in some ways 
it gives them advantages over 
their peers in other colleges.
Don’t get me wrong, I think 
this could be an advantageous 
distinction. But with the ups
comes the downs ... like the end­
less sea of red-tape which engulfs 
most daily actions; fortunately 
though, this gives us adequate 
preparation to deal with the real 
world. For example, I asked Hous­
ing a simple question involving 
certain aspects of next year’s 
housing procedure. They told me 
to call Residence Life.
Take, for example, the plight of 
the pole-vaulters. The pole-vault- 
ers on the CMU track team need 
to practice somewhere off cam­
pus, and they need to provide 
their own transportation to this 
remote site. So, a friend of mine 
tried to obtain a parking space to 
keep his car here, in order to 
make his own transportation an

Go figure. track practice. However, despite
this need, he was told that since 
he was merely a sophomore, he 
could only be put on the (vastly 
infinite) parking waiting list. My 
friend even went as far as to write 
email to President Mehrabian, 
but to no avail. To quote my friend, 
he never got a response because 
he was “a member of that class of 
untouchables which the admin­
istration can not communicate 
with or admit the existence of: I 
am a student.”
The list goes on. CMU dorms 
are very lax on visitor regula­
tions, which I personally find 
better then babying regulations 
other universities offer. CMU 
pays real life minimum wage, 
while other universities offer in­
flated salaries. CMU students 
deal with mud and construction, 
imposed inconveniences, and an 
urban lack of grass; bonuses 
which most other sheltered cam­
puses don’t offer. To top it all off, 
many students were recently in­
convenienced by the grand theft 
ofW ean 5419. Out of college, these 
‘real-life’ events might surprise 
many other college graduates, but
toleration of them will come 
surprisingly natural to CMU 
students.
But believe me, these ob­
stacles which make up my daily 
life will help greatly in our hec­
tic lives after college.
We will not get any special 
treatment in the real world, so 
why should we get it now?
So I say, more bureaucracy! 
We should make students sign 
all forms in triplicate, and get 
them signed by our mothers!
Students should not be al­
lowed to drop a class without 
getting a minimum of five sepa­
rate signature on form 3XA- 
875/RX!
Only when we can surmount 
such difficulties without a sec­
ond thought, will we surely es­
tablish ourselves as the uni­
versity that cranks out the 
highest caliber of student! Was 
mich nicht umbringt, macht 
mich starker.

ou might have noticed 
me jabbing at Pat 
Buchanan last week. 
Well, considering his all 
too scary showings in 
recent polls and prima­
ries, I feel it’s time to 
properly lambaste him.Y
Pat Buchanan is not a 
real conservative, at 
least not by my defini- 
________tion.
A fundamental tenet 
of conservative thought is that one should 
try to encourage excellence. This is done 
by promoting the free market and letting 
the best prove themselves.
This implies little government involve­
ment, though some can be accepted as 
necessary. It also relies upon a belief 
that a level playing field is better than 
leveling the players.
Buchanan doesn’t believe this. He con­
sistently rails against the free market.
He espouses protectionism as a founda­
tion of his platform. He believes that 
U.S. Industry can only succeed if we are 
protected from intense foreign competi­
tion. This is rather patronizing, don’t - 
you think?
In fact protectionism just causes the 
local industries to get non-competitive on 
a global scale.
Take the automotive market for example. 
Do you think we’d have the level of quality 
in American cars right now if they didn’t 
face stiff competition from the Japanese? 
We’d never have the compact without a 
push from the small designs of Toyota and 
Nissan.
Yes, our cars do have good quality, but 
only after the U.S. auto makers had their 
keesters handed to them on a silver plat-
abroad.
Now I’m not going to defend the Japa­
nese and their trade policies. They are 
quite poor in fact, but they are improving. 
It will take time however, and starting a 
trade war certainly won’t help the cause.
Buchanan is heartily in favor of a trade 
war. Does anyone remember the Great 
Depression?
It was started in part by a trade war.
Buchanan also loves to rail against Wall 
Street. He claims that they’re exporting 
American jobs, and getting the govern­
ment to bail them out. This is the fault of 
an attitude which expects the government 
to solve problems.
He’s also wrong about the cause of the
economy.
If you start a trade war like Buchanan 
supports, all you will do is kill the high- 
tech industries in which the U.S. excels 
worldwide.
Also the trade imbalance which people 
love to cite when making a protectionist 
case only includes manufacturing, and 
excludes service industries.
Keep in mind that the U.S. is moving 
to a service economy. This may sound 
like a bunch of people selling fries at 
McDonalds, but that isn't the truth. The 
service economy includes software pro­
duction, financial services, and enter­
tainment among others. Services can be 
as varied and expansive as the market
Buchanan is not even remotely a decent choice for 
the GOP nomination and is an even worse choice for 
President. I’d recommend that any conservatives 
who, for some reason, have come to support him 
reconsider their views.
loss of American jobs. Yes, companies are 
sending some unskilledjobs overseas. The 
real question is why.
Is it because of a New World Order plot 
as Buchanan would suggest?
No, they export jobs because of the high 
cost of government intervention in the job 
market.
Instead of facing up to reality, Buchanan 
would rather we try to shut out the world 
and live all by ourselves. He would rather 
take a nationalist stance to the exclusion 
of a rationalist one.
sees fit.
These are all huge fields which are 
very lucrative, and in which the U.S. 
holds virtual monopolies.
Of course there’s still the funniest part 
of the Buchanan platform. One of his 
main positions is that he’d take the rev­
enues from all his new tariffs and use 
this to give everyone a tax break. This is 
simply ludicrous. The money would 
spread only about as thin as a fine layer 
of butter.
If a tariff is high enough to promote
local industry, it will effectively bar im­
ports and thus generate little additional 
revenue; or, if a tariff is low enough, it will 
collect the money but have no effect on the 
local businesses. In his fantasy world, 
Buchanan believes you can have it both 
ways. The common people and reality do 
not agree.
His opposition to free trade is only one of 
his positions at odds with real conserva­
tives. He is also an isolationist. Granted, 
there are foreign adventures which Clinton 
has gotten into which are nonsense, but 
Buchanan basically supports pulling ev­
erything back into our borders.
We did this before WWII, and you can see 
what that got us. Isolationism only pre­
vents the opening of foriegn support and, 
incidentally, the opening of their purses.
He also took time to bash the Congress for 
allegedly cutting government aid for the 
poor, elderly, and dispossessed. This is a 
flat out lie which he could have taken out of
_______ Clinton’s playbook. Is the amount
of money in the relevant programs 
going down?
No, it isn’t. In fact, it is either 
staying the same or rising, albeit 
slowly.
Buchanan is not even remotely 
a decent choice for the GOP nomi­
nation and is an even worse choice 
for President. I’d recommend that 
any conservatives who, for some 
reason, have come to support him 
reconsider their views. His ideas 
are poor. His plans are slipshod 
and overly ignoran. He is unelectable, and 
does not appeal to the mass of even Repub­
lican voters.
His policies are founded on either lies or 
envy, and he even badmouths the Republi­
can Congress which is the real source of the 
present political progress.
Buchanan can do nothing but harm to the 
GOP and the nation.

Editor's Notebook
I suppose there is a large group 
of people who are more-or-less 
unaware of the bold maneuvers 
of the University in the realm of 
so-called “crime reduction.” It’s 
been disturbing to see so many of 
my friends fined hundreds of dol­
lars and required to do hours of 
community work for spending 
time relaxing and smoking.
Cannabis (also known as mari­
juana), has gotten a lot of bad 
press. Myths abound on its harm­
fulness, and its positive effects 
have been totally ignored. For 
people with AIDS, cannabis (and 
related “munchies”) was shown 
to help fight the “wasting syn­
drome” characterized by dramatic 
weight loss, and unlike AZT, does 
not damage a person’s immune 
system.
The appetite stimulation is also 
a helpful aid to those with 
anorexia nervosa. Have you ever 
seen someone stoned, or heard of 
the side-effect called “red-eye?”
It is caused by the lowering of 
the inner ocular pressure (IOP) 
inside the eye. Glaucoma raises 
the IOP, and accordingto Francis 
Young, DE A Administrative Law 
Judge, cannabis is two to three 
times better than presently ap­
proved glaucoma-fighting drugs. 
Cannabis has been shown to re­
duce stress in most people, dilate 
arteries to lower blood pressure, 
and studies done by El-Mallakh 
of UC Health Center show regu­
lar smoking of marijuana pre­
vents migraines.
And if you know anyone with 
oral herpes, you might want to let 
them know that Dr. Lansky of 
the University of South Florida 
said that direct contact with 
tetrahydrocannibinol (THC, the 
most active chemical in cannabis) 
killed herpes-virus lab cultures.
Finally, the last two arguments 
against pot, which I hear all the 
time. The first argument is that 
marijuana smoke contains 20 
times more tar than cigarettes.
This, however, isn’t true. A 
study in Jamaica that matched 
cigarette smokers with equiva­
lent cigarette smokers who also 
used marijuana found that the 
marijuana user’s lungs were, “if 
anything, a bit healthier than 
their matches,” and that using a 
water pipe (bong) cools the smoke 
and removes irritants.
The second argument is that 
marijuana affects your ability to 
function in society. I have no sci­
entific evidence to fight this, but 
I have personal experience that 
contradicts that thought. I know 
a number of adults who still 
smoke marijuana (the oldest 
smoker I know is almost 60), and 
all of them seem to be perfectly 
functioning adults.
There are many abusers of al­
cohol around the world, probably 
more than marijuana abusers. 
Alcohol is damaging to the liver, 
highly addictive, and in many 
ways poisoning to the human 
body. Why is alcohol legal and 
marijuana not? If all the mari­
juana users in America formed

organized crime rings, maybe it 
could be legal, too.
The most important reason 
marijuana smoking should be 
deemed safe is that there has 
never been a documented case of 
someone dying from marijuana, 
while 400,000Americans die from 
cigarettes a year. No one gets 
hurt. Until the police get involved.
I have one friend who has never 
been busted for anything except 
marijuana, and had approxi­
mately $200 worth of marijuana 
taken, about $100 of parapher­
nalia, plus about $200-$300 
worth of fines. Not only that, she 
is in danger of being kicked out. I 
have another friend, who has been 
maintaining a QPA of about 3.5 
and smokes marijuana daily, who 
was cited recently. He has,to go 
through the humiliation of meet­
ing a ResLife authority who will 
look down on him for smoking 
marijuana and ignore the suc­
cesses he’s had elsewhere. I was 
cited recently, even though I had 
not been smoking, and had in fact 
only recently entered the room.
I will probably have to meet a 
CMU police officer who will tell 
me about my past record and try 
to get me to admit my involve­
ment in the “drug scene.”
I am grateful that CMU does 
not turn over students to the Pitts­
burgh police.
Things would be a lot worse. 
But given that CMU used to give 
$50 fines or a few hours of com­
munity service for smoking mari­
juana, one must wonder why they 
have upped the punishment for 
marijuana use.
According to Link magazine, 
campus arrests in American col­
leges rose 34 percent between 
1992 and 1993. But according to 
Lynn Zimmer, a criminologist 
specializing in drug policy at 
Queens College in NYC, campus 
drug use during that period didn’t 
rise much at all. So why the in­
crease?
To answer tersely, consider the 
increase of money the colleges 
have been getting.
Consider the benefits of telling 
incoming students that campus 
police make many more arrests 
for marijauna use than other col­
leges. Who cares if it’s violent 
crime that’s reduced or not, right?
So next time you smell mari­
juana down the hall and are con­
sidering calling Campus Police, 
consider the fact that no one is 
being hurt.
But if you do call, well hey, the 
college gets more money through 
extortion and a fellow student’s 
life is made more difficult.

“What it all comes down to is 
dick size.”
As an actor, it is very rare 
that you get inspiring words of 
wisdom which help you move 
ahead and strive for excellence. 
But when they do come along, 
they stick with you for the rest 
of your career, echoing in your 
head, where they ultimately 
enhance each performance you 
give. Those few words above 
were graciously given to me by 
myfavoriteactingteacherhere. 
He is a man of very few words, 
but when he does speak, what 
he says counts. Some actors 
have to have the right pair of 
shoes before jumpinginto arole, 
some have to find the right 
voice. I simply think of that 
little statement and I'm off and 
running. You might find it odd, 
but, believe me, it works.
I bring it up only to show that 
it’s always important to have a 
good opening and a good end­
ing. It’s proven theory, at least 
by my roommate and I. A few 
weeks ago, he said to me, "You 
know Doug?”
And I sai d, "Sure, I know him. 
That’s me.”
And he said, “I’m always im­
pressed with the way you enter 
and leave conversation. It’s 
never ‘hello’ and‘good-bye’, but 
something with a twist. I like 
that.”
I said, “Shut your trap, you 
filthy piece of North Carolinian 
redneck dung.” And left. See? 
Good entry and exit. Why be 
boring?
We’re so damn busy, we for- 
gettolive. Another teacher told 
me that, but I won’t get into
that, because it’s from “the head.”
I’m not so sure if I’d give the 
penile size approach to acting to 
anyone else, probably because it’s 
so damn specific, but it did make 
me think of something my best 
friend back home in New Jersey 
sent me. It was a study published 
in the Journal of Sexual Research 
entitled, “College women’s at­
tempts to influence reluctant 
male sexual partners.” A survey 
of 112 women was made to see 
which were the most effective 
stimuli and if they would rate 
them positively or negatively. The 
highest one was flirting at 61. 
That doesn’t surprise me. It’s a 
normal human response. Up 
there as well were touching, strok­
ing, or complimenting his body. 
Pouting and sulking were quite 
high. Pleading was looked upon 
positively. But by far the best one 
of all was accusing him of being 
homosexual. That’s rich. “Um, is 
the reason you’re not making 
sexual advances on me because 
you’re gay?” “Gay? What the hell 
you talking about, gay? You think 
I’m gay? Take them clothes off, 
I’ll show you who’s gay! Hell, ask 
some of your friends over. I’ll do 
them too.” What I want to know, 
is where are these women who 
need to plead, and more impor­
tantly, where the hell are these 
reluctant guys?
I thought by definition all men 
in college were human penises. 
Or so I’ve been told by every femi- 
Nazi on campus' I’ve yet to meet 
these women. Where are they and 
can they call me? Don’t get me 
wrong. I have sex on a regular 
basis because I’m in the drama 
department. I have to. It’s part of 
my requirement towards gradu­
ation. It’s a class, actually. Each 
mini, you get a new sexual part­
ner. You try new techniques, po­
sitions, and stimuli, This 
semesters entitled “Food and
Toys for Girls and Boys.” It’s fun, 
but a lot of work. There is all this 
preparation, rehearsal, and then 
the final presentation. You have 
to do it in front of the class. Being 
watched and video taped isn’t 
embarrassing or anything, it’s 
just that sometimes the teacher 
steps in to show you the correct 
way and it can get very confus­
ing. I won’t get into it but let’s 
just say that it gives a whole new 
perspective on ass kissing.
I’m sure this isn’t a surprise to 
the CMU community.
Everybody already knows that 
actors are crazy and screw like 
j ackrabbits. It’s part of the charm. 
Granted, everyone is a tad loony 
in their own right, but the pri­
mary function of the actor, espe­
cially in public, is so everyone can 
look at them in jest, exclaiming, 
“Damn those actors are nuttier 
than a fruit cake,” and feel better 
about their own oddities.
If anyone is interested in hav­
ing sex with us, don’t hesitate to 
ask.
We get extra credit. We’ve all 
had our shots, carry protection 
24/7, and always bring props, but 
you should know what you’re get­
ting into. There is one basic dif­
ference.
Just so you know, there are two 
kinds of actors — one being a 
Musical Theater student (MT) 
and those who study straight (as 
opposed to gay) acting. To iden­
tify between the two, there are 
basic fundamentals to look for. If 
you are sitting in Morewood or 
GSIA eating lunch and quietly 
chatting with a friend, and from 
across the room you hear' stream­
ing forth from someone’s mouth a 
high pitched squeal somewhat re­
sembling a show tune you once 
heard from a horrible production 
ofWest Side Story thatyou saw in 
high school, that would be anMT. 
You quickly begin complaining
about how incredibly annoy­
ing it is to have those freaks 
interruptingyour lunch, when 
someone else from across the 
room starts yelling attheharpy 
for singing. This voice expels 
more foul language than a con­
struction worker and most 
likely has a cigarette in then- 
hand (unlit, but ready). That’d 
be a straight actor. At that 
time, you will have just wit­
nessed a “dramatic” moment. 
Don’t feel like you’ve missed 
anything if you haven’t hap­
pened upon one of these en­
counters, there will be another 
show in the next 15 minutes.
The sex itself is pretty much 
the same, but with one you 
smoke afterwards and the 
other, you get to do it to a live 
soundtrack.
I’ve heard rumors that Cam­
pus Police flat out ignore 
screams andshrieksin Maggie 
Mo because they have been 
trained to accept the fact that 
it is just a bunch of actors “do­
ing theirthing.” All I can say to 
that is, they’ve been trained 
well. Of course, Ihope Campus 
Police would be able to master 
that skill, since about the only 
other thing they do is ticket 
cars and roam the halls smok­
ing. Curious, isn’t it? They 
ticket you for smoking inside 
while at the same time they 
are smoking. So to recap, goOd 
beginnings and endings, be 
inspired, ahole is ahole, give a 
call, and remember what they 
say, the smaller hand, the 
smaller the jar you’ll have to 
put it in when you cut it off.
Doug will be taking “The Joy 
of Leather” next year in the 
drama department’s sex 
classes. Feel free to sign up, or

I wonder why almost every­
body here thinks whenever 
studying is over this whole school 
turns into this den of hedonism. 
In my three years at this 
Tom Harper school, I have never seen or heard 
about anything of the sort. I’ve 
been to my share of fraternity 
parties and I haven’t seen anything naughty happen.
I can remember one amorous episode between the guy who lived 
across from me and his girlfriend, which beat the hell out of any rock 
concert in terms of sound. All around my area of the hall we heard 
it, even through closed doors. I commented to my roommate, Brian, 
about the goings on.
Me: “You’d think she’d throw in an ‘Oh God!’ every so often.” 
Her: “OH GOD!!!!!”
Me: “...Can I call ‘em, or what?”
Brian: “Yeah.”
Other than that and my few personal experiences, who’s to say this
school is rife with horny students?
One commonly quoted fact is the male-to-female student ratio 
here, which according to what everyone thinks, is approximately 
15,000 to one. Maybe it seems daunting for most guys. It sure does 
to me. That, coupled with the fact that everyone I’ve always 
wanted to go out with already had a boyfriend. Maybe I have bad 
luck or good taste.
Lately girls have been saying that there aren’t enough guys 
here. Given the ratio, I think there aren’t enough guys here that 
girls find “their type.” I’m sure most gals’ definition of a good 
evening does not include four hours of MUDding and twelve hours 
of Nettrek. So, guys and gals, remain confident, stop downloading 
those dirty pictures off the net, and go out and have some fun.
You just might meet that special someone. And if not, could you 
tell some lucky gal I’m available?
Tom Harper is a very tired technical writing major. His turn ons 
include full body massages, walks in Schenley Park, and Italian 
Food.

The Alley Oop
by Chris Cannon
The NBA recently learned that start­
ing with the 1997—1998 season, the Wash­
ington Bullets will become the Washing­
ton Wizards, Magic Johnson has returned 
to the game and his no-look ways, and the 
Orlando Magic broke the NBA record for 
the best home start ever with a 28-0 
mark. But with all this magic going 
around the league, it’s the Miami Heat’s 
coach/general manager, Pat Riley that’s 
pulling off all the tricks.
He started the season by luring the 
Charlotte Hornets all-star center Alonzo 
Mourning away, but the fast moves he 
pulled off just hours before the trade 
deadline were, well ... magic. Gone is
aging Kevin Willis and undertalented 
Bimbo Coles to Golden State for former 
all-star Tim Hardaway and high percent­
age shooter Chris Gatling.
Gone is the injury-plagued and poor- 
shooting Billy Owens and Kevin Gamble 
to Sacramento for Walt Williams and 
Tyrone Corbin. Riley also 
traded rookie Terrence 
Rencher to Phoenix for a 
more-developed Tony 
Smith.
Some think the Heat’s 
moves are to make sal­
ary space for next year. *¦¦¦¦¦¦¦ 
Only three current play­
ers are guaranteed under contract for 
next season. Riley is well positioned for 
free agency sleight-of-hand and will slip 
in some more all-stars under the salary 
cap next year.
To fans and players around the league, 
the moves were startling. NBA teams are 
only allowed 12 players under contract, 
and Riley traded five of them in one day. 
The poor outside shooting of Riley’s trade 
bait let teams collapse on Mourning.
He felt that Miami had to do some­
thing; at 25—29 they’re the ninth-best 
team in the Eastern Conference. The top 
eight make the playoffs. To make things 
tougher, the teams ahead of them have 
made key moves too. Charlotte, the eighth 
best, made a move for point guard Kenny 
Anderson, whose play has been stellar.
“If anyone can perform the 
miracles needed, it’s the 
slick-haired Riley."
Atlanta (sixth) recently traded for tal­
ented, disgruntled forward/center Chris­
tian Laettner.
A Pat Riley-coached team has never 
missed the playoffs. Then again, all of 
Riley’s teams have won at least 50 games 
every season. The Heat need to win 25 of 
their last 28 to accomplish that.
However, even more amazing than his 
off-court maneuvers are his coaching 
masterpieces. The Heat won perhaps the 
season’s ugliest and prettiest games this
week, a 66-57 victory over the Sixers and 
a surprise upset over the Bulls. Because 
of the trades, Riley only had eight players 
available for the Chicago game.
If anyone can perform the miracles 
needed, it’s the slick-haired Riley. Be­
tween Hardaway, Williams, Mourning, 
rookie Kurt Thomas, and shooter Rex 
Chapman (9-10 from three-point range 
against the Bulls), the Heat could have 
the most talented starting lineup around.
However, as Orlando finds out every 
road game, having talented players and 
having talented players play together are 
two different things. Even if Riley can get 
the Heat in the playoffs, he’ll need a few 
more tricks up his sleeve to get past Chi­
cago or Orlando.
If he can’t bring the team together, they 
might start looking more like a remake of 
“Twelve Angry Men” than a top-notch bas­
ketball team.
Chris Cannon is a sophomore computer 
science major. Chris is leading his IM

ter one more game, he will lead them from 
ninth place all the way to the top.
Hockey team beats Allegheny, heads to league playoffs
T:M.mPp tsbi lCau c-
would still give CMU their cov­
eted first round seat in the divi­
sion. A loss could propel Allegh­
eny into the playoffs.
The first two periods were mis­
erable. Oxnard and Buck took 
the night off for injury. CMU was 
getting shut down by Allegheny’s 
defense, again, and stone-walled 
by their goalie, again, with fif­
teen shots and no goals 15 in the 
first 34 minutes. Compared to 
Allegheny’s 11 shots and four 
goals in the same time period, 
and the fact that one goal was 
shorthanded and CMU had not 
capitalized on any of their 
powerplays, they seemed to need 
a miracle.
Somehow, they got one. In the 
last minute of play, all 6'6" of 
Allegheny’s Jon Spinale flew 
across the ice and head-butted 
grad-student Sullivan, sending 
him reeling in pain. This penalty 
alone is a five-minute major and
automatic game misconduct. 
When Sullivan was brought to 
the bench for medical attention 
and Allegheny failed to provide 
an EMT, both teams were sent 
reeling.
By league rules, if the host 
team fails to provide an EMT, 
there is an automatic five-minute 
major at the beginning of each 
period without an EMT. The Al­
legheny club protested, but sure 
enough, the clock at the begin­
ning of the third reflected the 
referees’ decision, two five- 
minute majors in two minutes; 
four minutes of three-on-five 
hockey to be played coming out 
of the locker room.
The Tartans were elated and it 
showed in the electricity of their 
play. After 50 seconds, 
Maddalena got them starte d with 
a shot from Ardire making it 4- 
1. One minute later, still five on 
three, Paul scored from 
Maddalena making it 4—2.
Twenty seconds later, Ardire 
found Maddalena again and their 
one two punch made it 4-3 as the 
rush continued. The Allegheny 
team knew better than to get 
chippy, but began their attack to 
shut down Maddalena’s scoring.
As he was slowly taken out of 
play, the rest of the team picked 
up suit. Sanchez and Leonhardt 
continued to play smart with 
their heads up. Campo, 
Adukaitis, and assistant captain 
Blair Echols were stonewalling 
everything on defense; anything
— puck or player — that at­
tempted to enter the d-zone of 
CMU was denied. Just as the 
teams went back to five-a-side 
hockey, the force of Ardire and 
Maddalena found an open line to 
the net, and with unbelievable 
intensity and accuracy 
Maddalena’s slapshot tied the 
score at four all. In five minutes, 
the CMU club had come alive to 
play the kind of hockey that had
gotten them to that point; short 
shifts, powerful drives and never 
giving up. “I don’t remember 
many goals,” said Maddalena, 
“But that one is permanently 
locked in my mind.”
As well it should be. The play 
left the Tartans elated, which 
was only matched by the pure joy 
of the next play, 40 seconds later. 
Allegheny called a time out to 
regroup and the Tartans hustled 
to the bench.
One more and a hold and they 
would be there, in the playoffs 
and strong. They took the ice and 
a mixed line of Sanchez, 
Fitzgerald, and Ivanovic crashed 
towards the net. From Ivanovic, 
Fitzgerald tipped the puck to­
wards Sanchez as he.was being 
checked from behind directly in 
front of the net. Falling, he flipped 
the puck back towards the net 
and scored. Pandemonium.
The go-ahead goal came with 
over 10 minutes to go in the pe­
riod so Allegheny returned to the 
ice, aggressive and ready to hit. 
But even a team with the best 
defense in the league couldn’t 
break the Tartans that night. 
They were headed to the cham­
pionship on a high.
“Six more periods of hockey 
like that and we’re taking the 
championship,” said winning 
goalie Kliegman. It will be about 
consistent hustle, skating hard 
every 'play and becoming, in 
Coach Maddalena’s words, “the 
best team.”
The Tartan Hockey club trav­
eled to Indiana University of 
Pennsylvania this past weekend 
to participate in the league cham­
pionships. The championships 
started Friday night with the 
quarter-final match-up and con­
tinued through Sunday with the 
Championship game.
The games will be covered in 
the next issue.

for key individual performances 
from members of each team.
Donatelli looks for the distance 
squad to do well. “[The distance 
runners] will be where we score 
the bulk of our points.” He says 
Buchheit has an excellent chance 
to finish in the top three in the 
3,000m and 5,000m runs. Lott 
has an “excellent opportunity to 
be one of the top contenders as 
well” in the 5,000m run. 
McGranaghan should also be ex­
pected to run extremely well in 
the 3,000m run. Donatelli also 
looks for good support from the 
throwers, led by freshman Rosie 
Perez, who recently set a new 
school record in the shot put with 
a 33' 10" throw. He also thinks 
two high jumpers, junior Sarah 
Pacocha and freshman Erica 
Magliaro, should do well.
For the men, Meckley expects 
the team to do well in the shot put 
and pole vault. He also thinks 
that there are two sprinters who 
have a chance at placing, as well 
as some good performances by 
the hurdlers. The mile relay team 
should do well, as should the 800m 
middle-distance runners. 
Meckley said that they have some 
good mile runners in Kriechbaum 
and Zeisler, but there just has 
not been enough time to get them 
into top form. “Its definitely not 
our year,” he said. “We have a 
very young team — mostly fresh­
men and sophomores.”
Donatelli said, “We usually do 
OK indoors.” Still, they look for­
ward to the outdoor season be­
cause they “just can’t practice 
throughout the indoor season.” 
Donatelli said, “We can expect 
30—40 additional points in the 
outdoor season.” Meckley agreed, 
and said, “We’ll do better out­
doors — the playing field will be 
a little more level.”

Indians conquer Kenya, Windies in World Cup
Vl!L
um
International Sports
By Rahul Aggarwal
It has been over a week since 
(he Wills World Cup of Cricket 
'96 got underway, and England 
was the first team to suffer de­
feat at the hands of the Kiwis.
England’s poor fielding proved 
to be their downfall. Graham 
Thorpe was the main culprit, 
dropping two of the four dropped 
catches, including that of 
Nathan Astle when he had only 
one run to his name.
He capitalized on this mistake 
and added a further 100 runs 
allowing New Zealand to make 
239/6 from their allocated 50 
overs. In reply, England could 
only manage 228/9 with Graeme 
Hick the top scorer for England 
with a fine 85. England man- 
i to see off the minnows in 
their group by hammering the 
UAE and overcoming a stub-, 
born Holland side. Hick, again 
in the runs with a century (104*) 
against Holland, is one of the 
few English batsmen in good 
form.
England now has to play the 
tougher opponents in their group
— South Africa and Pakistan. I 
personally would like to see En­
gland win, but considering South 
Africa recently thrashed En­
gland 6-1 and Pakistan is play­
ing at home — added to the fact 
that both are used to the condi­
tions — England will be lucky to 
win against either of them.
South Africa is looking to be 
World Championship material. 
Gary Kirsten signaled this with
record-breaking innings of 
188* against the UAE — one 
run short of Viv Richards’s all- 
time one-day record of 189. South 
Africa produced a magnificent 
performance in the field against 
New Zealand, beating them by 
five wickets.
No team can come close to the 
South Africans when it comes to 
fielding. Jonty Rhodes’ run out 
of Adam Parore was spectacular 
to say the least and underlines 
his title as the best fielder in the 
world. If they continue to play 
the way they currently are, then 
there is every possibility they 
can go all the way.
India opened their World Cup 
account with a resounding seven 
wicket victory over Kenya. Chas­
ing 200 for the win, Sachin 
Tendulkar, the backbone of the 
Indian batting line-up, did not 
disappoint with a superb cen­
tury (127* off 134 balls). He.got 
to a blazing start as he al­
ways does in one-dayers and 
toyed with the average Kenyan 
bowling. He timed the. ball beau­
tifully and pierced the gaps with 
precision. He slowed down, how­
ever, as he approached the magi­
cal three-figure mark and was 
lucky to escape an LBW decision
. when on 99. Had the umpire given 
him out then, the fanatical In­
dian supporters wouldn’t have 
let him out of the stadium alive! 
Eventually he reached his first 
World Cup century, and after that 
began to cut loose again. At the 
other end, Ajay Jadeja played 
second fiddle to Tendulkar and 
compiled his first World Cup 50. 
The pair had put on a partner­
ship of 163 when Jadeja gave his 
wicket away going for the big hit. 
Navjot Sidhu (1) and Vinod 
Kambli (2) departed in similar 
fashion leaving it for Tendulkar 
and Nayan Mongia to steer India 
to victory.
short of his half-century, 
Richardson attempted to hit Manoj 
Prabhakar out of the ground, only 
to pick out the one man stationed 
at the mid-wicket boundary. The 
West Indies collapsed from 91/2 to 
99/5, as Anil Kumble tore through 
the middle order, reinforcing what 
I said earlier — the West Indies 
can’t seem to handle pressure.
It took a spectacular diving catch 
from Mohammed Azharuddin to 
get rid of Chanderpaul, and after 
that the West Indies surrendered 
easily — 173a/o. Srinath was the 
pick of the Indian bowlers with 
magnificent figures of 10-0-22—2. 
He has come on leaps and bounds
India’s next game against the 
West Indies promised to be a 
cracker where the two best bats­
men in the world were to meet 
head to head: Brian Lara versus 
Sachin Tendulkar. West Indies 
skipper Richie Richardson chose 
to bat, and it wasn’t long before 
SHerwin Campbell played on to a 
Javagal Srinath in-cutter.
Enter Lara: The whole world 
was eagerly anticipating fire­
works from him, but with only 
two runs to his name, he received 
a peach of a delivery from Srinath 
and was dubiously given out 
caught behind by Pakistani um­
pire Khizar Hayat. The replay 
showed that the ball had appar­
ently flicked his pad on the way 
through to the keeper, not his 
bat. Richardson and Shivnarine 
Chanderpaul began to repair 
some of the early damage done by 
the lively Srinath, and only three

since the last World Cup and is 
looking very much like the com­
plete pace bowler India has des­
perately been looking for.
Now it was Tendulkar’s turn to 
bat. He had to beat Lara’s two 
runs. However, with only two runs 
to the Indian score, the fearsome 
Curtly Ambrose knocked out 
Jadeja’s middle stump. Anyone 
thinking that the 6'6" demon was 
past his peak was silenced very 
quickly, as he accounted for Sidhu’s 
wicket in similar fashion the next 
over. India reeling at 15/2' now 
looked to their best batsmen to dig 
them out of a hole.
Tendulkar and Azharuddin have 
so often pulled India out of diffi­
cult situations, and they did so 
again in style. Azharuddin was 
middling the ball right from the 
word go and Tendulkar was his 
usual self — elegant. He rarely 
gives chances, but on this occasion

he gave two catches, both of 
which were dropped; Courtney 
Browne dropping a sitter when 
the “Little Master” was on 23. 
This proved to be costly for the 
West Indies. Roger Harper 
managed to remove Azhar with 
a poor ball and then it was 
India’s turn for a mini-collapse. 
Tendulkar eyeing another cen­
tury was foolishly run-out and 
Prabhakar gave a caught-and- 
bowled to Harper. The West 
Indies were back in the game 
with India struggling on 127/5. 
However, Kambli, with a point 
to prove, punished anything 
short and smacked Ambrose 
over mid-wicket for six. He was 
ably assisted by Mongia, and 
the paii’ eventually steered In­
dia to an important five-wicket 
win.
India now faces the might of 
the Australians on February 
27. This should be another fas­
cinating encounter, with a duel 
between legspinners Shane 
Warne and Anil Kumble. Al­
though Warne is the best spin­
ner in the world in my eyes, in 
the past he has been butchered 
by the Indian batsmen, and if 
he doesn’t drop onto a good line 
and length early on, Tendulkar 
and Kambli will make sure he 
receives similar treatment 
again.
The Waugh brothers look in 
excellent form with the bat for 
Australia — both scored 
heavily against Kenya (Mark 
Waugh 130, Steve Waugh 82). 
If India plays the way they did 
against the Windies, they can 
win this. This is definitely the 
tie of the tournament so far.
Sri Lanka looked impressive 
against Zimbabwe, rattling up 
the required 229 runs in only 
38 overs — Aravinda De Silva 
was Man of the Match with 91 
and Asanka Gurusinha was 
also in the runs with 87. One 
should not rule out Sri Lanka’s 
chances of getting far in this 
World-.Cup. Pakistan has yet 
to play their first game and 
will look to pacemen Wasim 
Akram and Waqar Younis to 
create havoc for the batsmen.
This World Cup bodes to be a 
fascinating one—we will have 
to wait and see who comes out 
on top.

From the Point
by Jason Andracki
There isn’t a more thankless 
job in sports, or in the world for 
that matter, than being a 
goaltender. They rank right up 
there with garbage men and coro­
ners. When a team wins, it’s usu­
ally the goal scorers that get the 
credit, but with a loss, the blame 
often falls on the man between 
the pipes.
Even with shutouts, the win is 
usually characterized as a “whole 
team effort” with the defense re­
ally coming together.
Perhaps I’m a little more sensi­
tive to the plight of goalies be­
cause that was the first position I 
was forced to play. I wasn’t cho­
sen based on skill, it was just that 
I was six years younger than my 
uncle, so he could force me into 
playing. I wonder how many NHL 
goalies got their start this way.
Not only is their role thankless, 
but goalies have about as much 
job security as a Beta VCR re­
pairman. Look at what happened 
in this season alone.
The Boston Bruins’ Blaine 
Lacher was a finalist in voting for 
the Calder Trophy, and along with 
Washington Capital Jim Carey, 
was one of the big surprises of 
last year’s lock-out shortened sea­
son. This season, as soon as 
Lacher gives up a few soft goals, 
he loses his starting job to peren­
nial back-up Craig Billington and 
Boston joins the Curtis Joseph 
lottery. Well instead of Joseph, 
the Bruins end up with Bill 
Ranford (again), and Lacher is 
deported to Providence to do some 
more work.
An example of instability is the 
Patrick Roy debacle. The 
Montreal Canadiens making the 
playoff was up there with death 
and taxes as things you can count 
on in life.
In 1995, people died, and even 
more people paid taxes, but the 
Habs started their golf season 
the earliest they have since 1970. 
Combine that with a horrendous 
opening of this season, and you

Montreal gave up the man that,I’' 
brought the last two Stanley 
Cups. I think Montreal could have "" 
been a little more considerate to 
the rest of the league and not 
given the Colorado Avalanche the.-, 
final piece of their Cup puzzle. At 
least we’ll get to see Claude* 
Lemieux and Roy reunited in the

Some teams do treat theif“^ 
goaltenders with a bit more reV"' 
spect. Look at the New York Rang-- 
ers. Mike Richter had a toughT 
start this season, and even though- n 
Glenn Healy did get a few calls, 
they didn’t start shipping Richil 
ter around.
The same goes for the New Jer­
sey Devils. They realize thattheiiT’1' 
problem lies in their offense and 
not Martin Brodeur.
My favorite goalie story is proby 
ably that of Ron Hextall. When:/.: 
the Philadelphia Flyers packaged- 
him with nearly half their rosterlv 
to get Eric Lindros, he seemed',"' 
washed up with the New YorEl!J 
Islanders. 1 .
Last season, he was dealt bacK 
to the Flyers, and along with -. 
Garth Snow, formed the most"; 
dominant goaltending platoon s 
since Bob Sauve and Don.’- 
Edwards split the time between 
the pipes for the Buffalo Sabres 
in the early ’80s.
Most teams see switching 
goaltenders as a quick fix, likej-. 
firing the coach. Sometimes this 
works, but more often it fails. 
This just makes goalies one of the 
most abused athletes in sports', 
even aside from the 100-mph slajD' 
shots at their heads.
If you’re interested in the plight1 
of goaltenders, I recommend Operi 
Net by George Plimpton.
It’s a retelling of his Sport Il­
lustrated (yes, SI used to cover 
hockey!) assignment of playing"- 
goal for the Bruins in a pre-seau 
son game. f!cm
Jason Andracki is a junior prti2 " 
fessional writing major. He fondly 
remembers the days when Ron,* 
Hextall would take home rutty* 
swings at Rob Brown of the Pitts 
burgh Penguins. Of course, Brown •:? 
usually didn’t take too kindly ton[,y 
this. I wonder why.

Baseball guru picks Orioles, again
The Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
It’s been a long two years since 
I’ve felt the kind of excitement 
that I feel in this frigid Febru­
ary. In 1994, it was inevitable 
that there would be a work stop­
page, and in 1995 there was no 
work (at least not until April). 
That’s all in the past now, 
though, and Major League Base­
ball is primed for what should 
be a banner season and a rec­
lamation of its title as the 
“national pastime.”
So without further delay,
I’d like to walk that road all 
baseball fans start on in late 
winter — forecasts and pre­
dictions. Let’s start with the 
American League East.
Baltimore Orioles: I see a 
trend developing. For the past 
three years, I’ve picked the 
Orioles to win the division and 
possibly continue to the Se­
ries, and every year they’ve 
flopped. As a result, I will 
make a vow — if the team 
doesn’t win this year, I will 
never pick them again, for the 
rest of my life (even if they are 
in a one-team division).
This team has it all; by adding 
Roberto Alomar, B. J. Surhoff, 
Dave Wells, Kent Mercker, and 
Randy Myers, the O’s have filled 
all the holes from last year. By 
far, though, the most important 
additions were manager Davey 
Johnson and general manager 
Pat Gillick.
Johnson has never managed 
a team that finished below, sec­
ond place in the course of a full 
season, and he has the highest 
winning percentage among ac­
tive managers. Gillick, mean- 
¦while, has already earned a 
¡reputation as the smartest and 
Islickest GM in baseball. The 
D31ue Jays didn’t win two World 
Series by chance.
1 Prediction: 1st place.
Boston Red Sox: Well, if the 
Sox win this year, at least it 
won’t be a major surprise. This 
is essentially the same team as 
last year’s division-winner, with 
afew important additions: Mike 
Stanley replaces Mike Mac- 
Farlane as catcher, Will Cordero 
is now the everyday second 
baseman, and Dwayne Hosey 
will man center field.
Their success will depend on 
whether the O’s crash and 
whether Aaron Sele and Tim 
Wakefield can come back and 
have productive seasons. The 
addition of hard-throwing Tom 
“Flash” Gordon and Heathcliff 
Slocumb will help, but the bot­
tom line is that somebody has to 
help out the “Rocket.”
Prediction: 2nd place.
Detroit Tigers: After several 
years of attempting the strat­
egy of relying on washed-up 
older veterans to win a division, 
the organization has finally gone 
to a youth movement, which is 
successfully underway.
The probable starting rota­
tion of Felipe Lira, Sean 
Bergman, Jose Lima, C. J. 
Nitkowski, and Clint Sodowsky 
includes nobody over age 26. 
Though they are in for a season- 
long shellacking, they all pos­
sess a great deal of talent that 
needs some big-league-harden- 
ing to turn them into future 
seasons’ big stars.
The youth movement has also 
extended to the manager’s box, 
as the venerable Sparky Ander­
son has moved over for a more- 
than-able replacement in Buddy
a cut slider and changeup that 
could propel him to the top of the 
American League statistical 
pitching categories.
Prediction: 3rd place.
Toronto Blue Jays: Oh, how 
the mighty have fallen. This 
team truly has the potential to 
be one of the worst in baseball. 
The pitching staff is question­
able at best. None of the pro­
jected five starters (Pat Hentgen, 
Paul Quantrill, Erik Hanson, 
Juan Guzman, Jeff Ware) had 
ERAs below 4.00 last year, and 
there isn’t a single proven closer 
on the staff. Although some of 
the big names are still around 
(Olerud, Carter, Sprague), the 
Alomars, Winfields, Molitors,
Bell. There are very few men in 
the game who have paid their 
dues and experienced as much 
as Bell. Finally, new GM Randy 
Smith (also the youngest in the 
majors) will continue what he 
started in San Diego.
Prediction: 4th place.
New York Yankees: I’m still 
not quite sure why a team that 
was so successful and partici­
pated in what I consider to be 
the greatest baseball game I’ve 
ever seen (Game 5 of the AL 
Wild Card Series) incurred so 
much turnover.
Maybe the “Boss” just felt like 
making his presence known — I 
don’t know, and probably will 
never know. The point is that 
the heart and soul of this team 
is gone. As sad as it is, we will 
never see “Donnie Baseball” don 
Yankee pinstripes again; the 
same goes for the intense Jack 
McDowell, Mike Stanley, and 
manager Buck Showalter. Nev­
ertheless this team still has a 
great deal of talent, and the off­
season additions of Tino 
Martinez, Kenny Rogers, and 
Mariano Duncan should help.
In addition, I’ve always felt 
that new manager Joe Torre al­
ways had his hands tied in St. 
Louis, and he should have an 
easier time demonstrating his 
true managerial abilities in New . 
York—that is, unless the “Boss” 
decides to step into matters.
Finally, look for the little-men- 
tioned addition of Dwight 
Gooden to suddenly become the 
most inspiring story in base­
ball. Gooden is still throwing in 
the mid-90’s and has developed
tln1L hbva¥Vgvdbs Staff
Borders, etc. have all either gone 
elsewhere or retired. More or 
less, the entire organization is 
due for a major rebuilding pro­
cess. The farm system is dry, 
which is often the price one pays 
when acquiring the necessary 
parts of a contender, and as a 
result will offer no immediate 
help. I recommend taking a trip 
to Toronto this season. It will be 
a great time to get good seats for 
a Jays game.
Prediction: Last place.

and decision sciences major.

Below the Rim
by Darren Chiappetta
Well, everybody, the time has 
come. For all four of you who 
indulged me last year, listened 
to my rantings about college, pro, 
and any other kind of basketball 
I could think of, read along know­
ingly as I incorrectly picked ev­
ery major award and champion­
ship winner ... I’m back. Sort of. 
I will be offering my less-than- 
expert opinion on James 
Naismith’s favorite game on a 
part-time basis this year. So, 
without further ado, let’s go Be­
low the Rim. Just a few observa­
tions from the past week:
For those of you who care about 
local college basketball, what’s 
going on with the Pitt Panthers? 
In the last 10 days, Pitt has blown 
double-digit leads against 
Villanova and Rutgers, and 
they currently sit in the 
basement of the Big East 
Seven.
The Villanova loss was 
somewhat understandable 
— the Wildcats are a Top 5 
team, and Pitt’s big lead 
came early in the first half.
But the Rutgers game? The 
Panthers led by 20 with 
seven-and-a-half minutes 
in the game at home, and I 
can’t stress this enough, 
they were playing Rutgers.
The fact that the Scarlet 
Knights had to hit a three- 
pointer at the buzzer to win 
by one is not the point.
Pitt head coach Ralph Willard 
was brought in two years ago 
because he had a reputation as a 
hard-nosed coach who was al­
ways able to get maximum effort 
out of his players.
Although the Panthers 
struggled last year, no team in 
the Big East played harder, and 
with a freshman class ranked by 
some recruiting experts as being 
in the top 10 in the country, things 
looked bright for the near future. 
After Pitt humbled Georgetown 
75-56 on January 10 to improve 
to 7-3, that future looked like it 
was here sooner than later.
But now, that future is cloudy. 
Willard took most of the credit 
for Pitt’s modest success this 
year, and he must take the 
blame for this year’s disappoint­
ing team.
The troubles for Pitt run deep. 
'The team has no reliable center 
or shooting guard, and while 
most people expected the fresh­
men to struggle as they adjusted 
to major college basketball, 
something has become fairly 
apparent: These guys just aren’t 
as talented as they were touted 
to be.
Add to that the apparent chem­
istry problems on the team (there 
are reports of cliques on the team, 
and Willard benched senior point 
guard Jerry McCullough earlier 
in the year for poor practice hab-
m2d—f hbva¥Vgvdbs Staff
its), and it looks like it may be a 
long time before Pitt rises to the 
level of the late ’80s and early 
’90s, when the Panthers were 
always in the running for the Big 
East title.
On the professional hoops front,
did anyone notice that there were! 
a few trades before the trading! 
deadline Thursday? Did anyone'; 
notice that none of the trades- 
will do anything to improve any: 
of the teams involved? There were! 
some big names involved (Tim; 
Hard-away, Christian Laettner),j 
but so what? Miami traded away! 
half its team but still won’t make! 
it to the playoffs, and most of the! 
deals seem more geared to grab-< 
bing headlines than making; 
headway.
And while I’m talking about; 
the Heat, I heard just about thej 
dumbest thing ever when they; 
were talking about the! 
Hardaway-Chris Gatling for! 
Kevin Willis-Bimbo Coles deal.; 
One of the announcers said that; 
now Miami has a potent center-; 
point guard combination (mean-; 
ing Alonzo Mourning and; 
Hardaway). So?
Let’s examine the practical ap-I 
plication of this logic for a mb-J 
ment. While some championship^ 
teams have had this “potent com-j 
bination” (Magic Johnson and: 
Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, for eX| 
ample), how about the last five 
NBA Finals winners? HmmJ 
Houston won the last,1 
two Finals with! 
Hakeem Olajuwoii,! 
and if anyone even! 
knew that the Bulls had! 
a center during their 
three-peat run, give me; 
a call and let me know; 
who he was.
Nevertheless, it;
doesn’t matter. Chicago,: 
with Michael Jordan at. 
the point and Luc 
Wennington at center 
(or is that Bill Longley?) ,j 
is going to win the title.; 
That’s certainly the; 
point-center combo eV-; 
ery team should look for. ’ |

Track places well at Slippery Rock, Denison
By PAUL BOOTHE
Tartan Sports Editor
The men’s and women’s track teams 
wrapped up the regular season this week 
with arelay-invitational at Slippery Rock 
University and an invitational at 
Denison University. Despite some key 
injuries, the teams placed well at both 
events and are now preparing to head to 
the UAA Championships this weekend.
At the Slippery Rock Invitational, the 
men’s and women’s indoor teams com­
peted against 13 other schools in relay 
events. The other schools were mostly 
Division III, but some Division I and II 
schools were in attendance. Men’s coach 
Gary Meckley was pleased with the 
teams’ performances. “We did pretty 
well,” he said. “Mainly what we were 
looking for [at Slippery Rock] was how 
we matched up against other Division 
III teams.”
Although the official results will not 
be in for more than a week, Meckley 
made estimations as to the placing per­
formances by the men’s team. The high 
jump relay took third or fourth overall. 
The 4-mile relay team took third; first
among Division III opponents. The 
shuttle hurdle relay team finished sec­
ond in Division III, fourth overall. Both 
the sprint medley and the distance med­
ley relay placed in the top three overall, 
and the 4x200m relay finished in the top 
five, first or second in Division III. The 
shotput relay also did well, finishing 
fourth or fifth overall.
The team’s performance is especially 
remarkable because they were missing 
several key players. The top sprinter 
and top high jumper, freshman Froilan 
Montenegro and sophomore Peter Hunt, 
are both injured. Seb Zeisler, a top dis­
tance runner, has a slight hamstring 
pull. The team was also missing its top 
shot putter, senior E.J. Tsangaris, be­
cause of a class conflict. Several other 
members of the team did not participate 
in events so as not to risk injury before 
the UAA Championships at Chicago Uni­
versity. Women’s coach Dario Donatelli 
said, “We picked and chose our races to 
fine tune for Conference.”
The women’s team also did very well. 
The 4-mile relay squad of freshmen 
Margaret Powers, Melissa Lott, and 
Maureen McGranaghan, and junior
Becky Buchheit, won the event. The 
team also took second in the 4x800m 
run.
On February 17, members of the track 
teams participated in an invitational at 
Denison University. The participants 
from CMU were mostly distance run­
ners, as the sprinters had just come back 
from a meet at Bethany College. Senior 
Melissa Baustert led the list of Tartan 
achievements, setting Denison Field 
House records on her way to winning 
both the 500m run in 1:19.5 and the 
1000m run in 3:04.5. For the men, CMU 
runners claimed three of the top four 
spots in the 800m run. Freshmen Chris 
Louks, Kristo Kriechbaum, and Brad 
Dollar finished second through fourth 
respectively. Also, junior Ron Polcawich 
finished third in the 3000m run.
While both teams are prepared for 
UAA’s this weekend, they are unsure 
how well they will do. Meckley said, “We 
have some kids hurt, kids that could 
place for us.” Both coaches also said that 
the CMU squad is behind a lot of the 
other teams because of our lack of indoor 
facilities. Still, the coaches are looking

lege on Monday and a 57-55 home 
win over Thiel.
In the game against Rochester, 
the Tartans went down big, 24—1 
in the first 10 minutes. Cold shoot­
ing by the Tartans and hot shoot­
ing from Rochester did not bode 
well for the rest of the game.
For the remainder of the first 
half, the Tartans 
chipped away at the 
lead, switching to a 
zone defense that 
brought them to a 31- 
16 deficit at the half.
In the second half, 
the Tartans came out 
with a fiery man-to-

Tony Wingen said they

the 10-minute mark, 
which they did. It was 
junior Rich Bodnar’s 
three at the six-minute 
mark that put the Tar­
tans up 48-47, and 
they never relin­
quished the lead.
Senior Kevin Byrne 
tallied 17 to lead the 
Tartans, and sopho­
more Gary Trendel added U 
points to the total.
For the season, the Tartans 
finished with a 6-8 record in the 
UAA. CMU had been tied for 
fourth place with Rochester and 
took sole possession of fourth af. 
ter the win.
The 13-12 mark also means 
the Tartans had a back-to-back 
winning season for the first time 
since 1978-79, a trend Wingen 
would like to continue. He said 
that the year was disappointing 
for the Tartans. They had hopes 
of contending for the title in the 
UAA and in securing a tourna­
ment place, but those hopes faded 
away during the season.
He said that poor rebounding 
and bad shooting, both from the 
floor and from the foul line, con­
tributed to this. But the team 
turned things around, which he 
said made him “very pleased and 
very proud ... it shows a lot for 
these kids, not only as players 
but as people.”
While he was sad to see the six 
seniors leave, Wingen thinks that 
his good returning nucleus prom- 
ises an exciting next season for 
the Tartan men’s hoops squad,
The Carnegie Mellon women’s basketball team 
wrapped up its season Saturday with a 77—72 
win in New York against the University of Roch­
ester. The Tartans were led in scoring by junior 
Penny Summerville, who had 20 points, six re­
bounds, and three steals, and by junior Kelly 
Gaitens, who hit for 17 points on four-of-five 
shooting from beyond the three-point line. Sopho­
more Katie O’Leary led the Tartan rebounding 
effort with 10 boards.
With a balanced attack in which Summerville 
and Gaitens were but two of five CMU players to 
score in double figures, the Tartans shot 50 
percent from the field. Not seriously threatened 
until late in the game, as a 16-point half-time 
lead would suggest, the Tartans played their 
best basketball of the year, head coach Gerri 
Seidl said.
“They came back at us, but we held on,” Seidl 
said. “I never thought all year that there was a 
game where we had all five players on the court 
clicking at once. It was the best overall team 
performance we have had all year.”
Last Tuesday, the Tartans traveled across 
town to play against Chatham College, a team 
that lost to Carnegie Mellon S7—18 earlier in the 
season. While this rematch was somewhat closer 
than the earlier game, CMU still won the game 
handily', 82-26..
Gaitens led the Tartans in scoring, shooting 
well to add another 20 points to her statistics for 
this season.
“Everybody got to play and contribute in that 
game,” Seidl said about the Chatham game. 
“There are a lot of things, like setting picks, that 
don’t show up on paper, and it can be nice for the 
athlete to show up in the stat box.”
With these two wins, the Tartans improved 
their final record to 8-17 overall, and 2-12 in 
the league.
While that record isn’t spectacular, it doesn’t

reflect the true ability of the team.
“We play in the toughest conference in Divi­
sion III basketball,” Seidl said. “Five of the nine 
teams in the UAA went to the NCAA tourna­
ment last year, and four might go this year. Nine 
of our games were against ranked opponents.”
Despite that, however, Seidl feels that UAA 
teams are evenly matched. “On any given night, 
any given team can win.”

In the last weekend of regular 
season play, Carnegie Mellon 
faced back-to-back games Feb­
ruary 17 and 18 against power­
ful Allegheny College. Allegh­
eny had been struggling this se­
mester, and the Tartans knew 
it. CMU had most of its starters 
healthy, although they were still 
waiting for the return of 
defenseman Paul Voulgaris and 
were forced to watch junior 
winger Relja Ivanovic linger in 
the box undressed and serving 
his suspension from last 
weekend’s butt-end call in the 
Pitt game.
However, the CMU
coverage and flipped the puck 
over the Allegheny goalie’s 
shoulder. The play was set up by 
excellent backchecking by jun­
ior defense-man Chris 
Adukaitis, and the goal came on 
a pass from junior winger An­
thony Paul.
The formula for scoring 
seemed to be set; now they had 
to follow it. But the Allegheny 
club seemed to know some chem­
istry as well, and proceeded to 
score twice within 40 seconds, 
only a minute after the CMU 
surge. Undaunted, senior cap­
tain Roger Maddalena skipped 
around the celebrating Allegh­
eny club and slid the puck past 
the bewildered goaltender on a 
defense-
Fitzgerald and assistant cap­
tain Adukaitis, scoring to make 
the game 5-3, Allegheny. The 
momentum the goal sparked, 
both from the bench and the 
crowd, sent Maddalena reel­
ing towards the goal again, sur­
prising the keeper with a 
slapper from junior winger Jim 
Buck. This allowed the team to 
enter the locker room on a posi­
tive note. With the exception of 
the loss of another forward, 
Andy Oxnard, to a knee injury 
late in the period, the last five 
minutes were how they should 
play: tight, heavy, and strong.
The third period was disap­
pointing. No matter how much 
forechecking junior winger Ray 
Ardire could muster, or how

loose, Allegheny had only 
brought eleven players and a 
goalie down for the Saturday 
night game, the fans were cry­
ing for blood in the stands, and 
they knew that all they had to do 
was win to clinch their first- 
round bye in the playoffs. It 
seemed so easy. But with the 
first period halfway gone and no 
progress being made by the 
power forwards on the CMU 
front line, the Tartans sensed 
that something was up, and it 
wasn’t their caliber of play.
The game seemed to be all 
defensive. There were only eight 
shots in the first period by a 
team that has three players who 
average eight shots a game. 
Allegheny’s defense was shut­
ting down CMU, tangling them 
on their drives to the net, and 
sending them to the bench shak­
ing their heads every time.
Finally, halfway through the 
period, sophomore Scott 
Fitzgerald and the second line 
finally penetrated the d-zone
man Bryan Campo, who was at 
his usual position high in the 
slot. With the game tied, the 
crowd rose again and the CMU 
bench teetered with anticipa­
tion. Another Allegheny goal 
ended the first period, and coach 
Maddalena called the belea­
guered Tartans toward their 
home bench.
Inconsistency can be the down­
fall of any team, and the Tartan 
hockey club has struggled with 
intensity level all year. Coming 
off the Pitt tie from last week- 
-end, one would think that they 
would be raring for a win.
The second period showed the 
holes in their play. Allegheny 
scored two more unanswered 
goals and was beating CMU at 
their strongest point, heavy hit­
ting. Even though three of the 
five penalties in the second came 
down on the Allegheny team, 
CMU could not capitalize on the 
man advantage.
With four minutes left, Paul 
crashed the net with the help of
much digging the freshmen 
rookies Dino Sanchez and 
Steve Leonhardt would at­
tempt, they just couldn’t get 
the puck past the Allegheny 
wall of defense with any 
strength.
Allegheny scored again late 
in the third to end the game at 
6-4. Sophomore goaltender 
Derek Jander took the brunt of 
the abuse, with 21 saves on 27 
shots from Allegheny. This was 
CMU’s first inter-divisional 
loss and maybe their biggest 
surprise. “We underestimated 
them [Allegheny], we judged 
them by their record, but they 
play as a team very well,” said 
player/coach Tom Sullivan on 
breaking CMU’s perfect record.
If CMU was sleepwalking 
this weekend, they did it all 
the way until 11:30 Sunday 
night in Erie, Pa. The team 
traveled to meet Allegheny 
College on their home ice at 
10:30; the rematch and win

Housing offers varied environments for students
By ENA KHAN
Tartan Diversions Editor
With room draw right around the cor­
ner, now is the perfect time to explore 
the various living options available 
through University Housing. CMU of­
fers its students an affordable and con­
venient alternative to the typical dorm 
scene with off-campus, Eastside, and 
suite side housing. This includes off- 
campus apartments such as Doherty 
and Fairfax, multi-level homes like 
Roselawn and the Margaret Morrison 
apartments on the Eastside and Suite 
Style living in Resnik and West Wing.
Some of the benefits to living off- 
campus, such as full kitchens, private 
baths, and larger living spaces, encour­
age many to live in apartments through 
the University. “We wanted a place on 
campus with a kitchen,” said Steve 
Schlosser, a sophomore ECE major. With 
the kitchens available in the apartments 
and Roselawn, students have the option 
of avoiding campus food altogether. “The 
food is miserable on campus. I got rid of 
my meal plan. I would rather cook,” said 
Ross Fubini, a sophomore CS major liv­
ing in Doherty Apartments. Eating at 
anytime of the day is one benefit to 
having a kitchen. “A kitchen is advanta­
geous especially considering my crazy 
hours,” said Fubini.
University housing makes the transi­
tion of moving off campus easier on stu-
dents by saving them the hassle of find­
ing an apartment on their own. Marsha 
Klosinski, the Housing Coordinator of 
Operations in charge of room draw said, 
“We save them the time of finding off- 
campus housing.” The university fur­
nishes these apartments, provides a 
network connection, or modem, and as­
sumes responsibility for any mainte­
nance issues. Students fill out a mainte­
nance request and housing takes care of 
it, preventing any potential conflicts with 
landlords. “Housingis helpful with main­
tenance requests,” said Perry Hatcher, 
a senior history and policy major.
A major perk to living in Eastside 
housing like Roselawn, according to 
Hatcher, is having a less active RA. “The 
RA is not completely involved in what 
you’re doing,” said Hatcher. The same is 
true of apartments such as Doherty. 
“They (RAs) don’t take as much of a 
hand in your life,” said Fubini. Although 
group activities, (such as study breaks 
with milk and cookies, trips to the mov­
ies and even the opera) are planned 
through Residence Life, they tend not to 
be as popular with students living in 
east side and off campus. Shana Quill, a 
RA at Fairfax Annex, complained about 
the low attendance rate at the last group 
activity to the opera. “Seven or eight of 
the 114 students went on the trip to the 
opera. It’s harder to get people out of 
their apartments to functions and pro-

If living on-campus next year is an option 
for you, consider the residence halls and apart­
ments of the “Hill.” Centrally located for get­
ting to and from campus, the Hill includes 
Donner, Hamerschlag, Scobell, Welch, Boss, 
McGill, and Henderson.
The Hill offers a variety of dorms that are 
certain to accommodate the social CMU stu­
dent. The majority of these dorms have a 
very energetic and open atmosphere. Many 
feel these are optimum qualities to have 
within a living environment. Darren Mauro, 
a sophomore computer science major, said, 
“The greatest things about living in Donner 
are the social atmosphere and the convenient 
location. The really large rooms are nice, too.”
Amy Ng, a freshman CIT student, feels 
Donner has a number of positive qualities. In 
fact, she looks forward to living there again 
next year. She said, “I like Donner. There are 
few co-ed dorms and this one is so open. The 
hallway atmosphere allows you to meet a lot 
of people as opposed to living to a suite. I also 
like the fact that one entire wall of the dorm 
is a window. I have to have natural sunlight. 
The windows also add to the openness, of the 
atmosphere.”
Many residents of Donner value the com­
munity experiences they have gotten out of 
living there. “When I came to college, I basi­
cally used Murphy’s Law,” said Rich Yavorsky 
a sophomore electrical and computer engi­
neering major, “I thought there would be show­
ers with no curtains and tiny rooms. I kept 
expectations really low. What I’ve gotten out 
of living here is above and beyond what I 
thought.”
Mauro, on the other hand, had great expec­
tations of dorm life when he arrived here last 
year. “I sort of expected an environment where 
I’d meet a lot of people,” he said, “I wanted to 
live in a place where there were a lot of fresh­
man. It’s great here because you can meet 
people who are in your classes and do home­
work together. Also, there are upperclassmen 
here so that you have a lot of resources. You 
can find ready experience in upperclassmen.”
Yavorsky agrees. He said, “You have sopho­
mores and freshmen and upperclassmen mix­
ing. You have people with your respective 
major to go to. Upperclassmen have freshmen, 
and freshmen have upperclassmen. I heard 
that they’re going, to make half of Donner a 
freshmen dorm. I don’t think it’s a good idea. 
The beauty of Donner is that it’s an integrated , 
environment.”
He added, “I think it’s pretty tough for fresh­
men to mix with upperclassmen here already.

The Boss Dormitory Lounge is a place for students to relax.

Tartan Forum Editor
Spacious accomodations. Fine 
dining. Courteous and conscien­
tious staff. These are three of the 
traits found in most first class 
hotels. And, with all honesty and 
some exaggeration, all of these 
can be found in Morewood 
Gardens.
“It’s kind of old and dumpy 
but it has a lot of character.” 
said sophomore ECE James 
Gagliardi. This one state­
ment sums up the building 
and says something for this, 
one of the oldest and largest 
CMU residence halls. “I’m 
definitely getting my 
money’s worth,” said 
Gagliardi. He is a desk at­
tendant who, along with 
Pedro Manautou, a sopho­
more MechE, introduced me 
to the world of Morewood.
The building itself is al­
most mazelike. However, it 
is well laid out with undaunting 
stairs and short halls that are 
conducive to socialization. Fea­
turing prime doubles and triples, 
as well as standard, fairly small
singles, all student attitudes are 
accounted for. The rooms are spa­
cious, especially the triples, and 
common areas dot the floors 
where students can get together 
and just “hang loose.”
“As long as you don’t bother 
anyone, you can do pretty much 
anything.” said Manautou. The 
halls in Morewood, although curv-
ing and cramped, were quiet. The 
walls were plastered with signs 
for movies and fraternity invita­
tions, and the people were open 
and friendly, like natives of a
foreign country inviting a 
strangely dressed tourist into 
their homes. Using leads given to 
me by Manautou and Gagliardi, I 
walked through Morewood ask­
ing people what they thought of 
their stay, why they came, 
whether they got their money’s 
worth, and what they would tell 
someone who wanted join their 
ranks.
“It sucks,” said freshman 
IM major Elizabeth Brooke. 
“It’s expensive and it 
sucks.” This young lady 
went on to tell me that “the 
rooms are disgusting and 
the bathrooms are never 
clean and they smell.” How­
ever, this was by far not the 
concensus. Almost all the 
students sampled said they 
were enjoying their stay, 
and that their (parents’) 
money was well spent.
“It’s convenient. The halls 
are curvy so it’s not as so­
cial, and for the most part, 
it’s quiet,” said freshman 
Jessica Demirs. The convenience 
issue that most of those inter­
viewed pointed out. Living in

grams.” This is unlike Resnik and 
WestWing which maintain the 
standard dorm environment and 
RA roles.
Eastside living has all the ben­
efits of the off-campus apart­
ments, but it alleviates the walk 
to campus, which is especially 
important during the cold winter 
months. “It’s the best of both 
worlds,” said Hatcher. Those liv­
ing in Resnik and West Wing also 
have this advantage. “I live so 
close to classes,” said Ramsey 
Hong, a senior communication 
design major. “A disadvantage to 
living in Fairfax is walking to 
campus through the cold,” said 
Kevin Wing, a freshman physics 
and CS maj or. On the other hand, 
some prefer maintaining a little 
distance from campus. “I like 
having a sense of going home 
from campus,” said Joe Upton, a 
junior drama major living in 
Fairfax apartments.
Perhaps the greatest disadvan­
tage of apartment, Eastside, and 
Suiteside living are the increased
prices. The rooms tend to cost a 
few hundred more than typical 
dorm rooms, but most students, 
like Steve Schlosser, find the 
amenities worth paying for. “It 
all balances out,” said Schlosser, 
a sophomore electrical and com­
puter engineering major living in 
Doherty apartments. Hong, hav­
ing moved from the Boss and 
McGill area to Resnik appreci­
ates the nicer, larger rooms, but 
finds the prices outlandish. “It 
would be cheaper to live off-cam­
pus,” said Hong.
Although these living arrange­
ments are typically reserved for 
upperclassmen, a large number 
of freshmen have recently been 
assigned to live in the apart­
ments. Due to the large size of the 
freshman class adequate hous­
ing was not available on campus. 
In turn, many lucky freshmen 
were given the opportunity to live 
inprivate off-campus apartments. 
Klosinski finds off- campus hous­
ing to be a means of “alleviating 
the on-campus housing shortage.” 
Kevin Wing plans on living in the

Fairfax Apartments for all four 
years. He finds having a kitchen 
and reduced meal plan conve-- 
nient. “I have a seven plus meal 
plan, so I don’t have to eat on 
campus as much,” said Wing. 
Some worry that off-campus liv­
ing can be a disadvantage to fresh­
man because the social atmo­
sphere is not as strong. “It (living 
in the apartments) isn’t good for 
meeting new people, but it is more 
private,” said Fubini. Suites in 
Resnik and West Wing also pro­
mote a private atmosphere.
The various living arrange­
ments such as off-campus, East 
side, and Suite-Side living offered 
through university offer alterna­
tives to the typical dorm environ­
ment. It’s important to consider 
their pros and cons when picking 
housing for the upcoming year

If you live with upperclassmen as a freshmen 
you have connections.”
Despite this fact, some students feel that 
living in an all freshmen dorm is a valuable 
experience as well. The Hill offers 
Hamerschlag for first—year male students. 
Carl Foner, a sophomore in the Bachelor of 
Humanities and Arts program explains. He 
said, “Hamerschlag was cool. There were just 
really cool people there. Everyone knew ev­
eryone and did a lot together. It’s a great 
environment.”
Mauro has the same sentiment. He said, 
“Hamerschlag really is a great environment 
for freshmen. I was an orientation counselor 
this year, and I was assigned to ‘Schlag. I 
remember what a strong community they 
had built. Though there were different groups 
of people, the fact that everyone is a fresh­
man is an initial bond.”
If you’re looking for a quieter place to live, 
Margaret Morrison Apartments, as opposed 
to the Hill Dorms, may be the place for you. 
Wendy Newman, a sophomore policy and 
management major explains the pros and 
cons of her living situation. She said, “It’s a 
good distance from campus, but it’s a walk to 
get home from parties. I love having a kitchen. 
Cooking is better than eating the cafeteria 
food.”
Newman believes that Margaret Morrison 
offers a different social atmosphere than that 
of dorms. She said, “It’s different because 
you’re just living with three people. You’re 
not walking down a hallway ever, but if you’re! 
hanging out on your porch, it’s social. It’s 
definitely more social here in nice weather. 
During the winter, you just go right to your 
room. It’s definitely less social than Donner 
or Morewood.”
Though Newman enjoys living in Margaret 
Morrison, she does feel it has some negative 
aspects. She said, “The thing that sucks is 
that the apartments facing Roselawn have 
bigger living rooms than the apartments on 
the other side, and we pay the same amount 
of money to live here. Also, you don’t have the 
luxury of a cleaning service to clean the ' 
bathroom and to take the trash.”
She added, “The walls are paper thin, too.
I wake up to blaring bass at 9:00 in the 
morning everyday.”
Students also think there are some disad­
vantages to dorm life as well. Bayani Caes, a 
sophomore computer science major said, “You 
can get stuck with someone you really don’t 
want to live with.”
Foner added, “Sometimes there isn’t any 
privacy. Everything is so open.”
Despite these facts, many students enjoy 
on-campus life for the atmosphere, conve­
nience, and the opportunity to meet and live 
with a multitude of different people. As a 
result, many plan to live on campus again, 
next year.
SDC Conference tackles housing concerns
PULP FREE
By Eric Salzman
Yesterday I needed to sneeze 
but didn’t have a tissue handy. I 
emailed myself a mes­
sage reminding me that 
when the opportunity 
came about, I ought to 
take a moment to sneeze.
Then I set out to search 
for tissues.
To save time, I down­
loaded the tissue Web 
page to locate the stores 
in which I may be able to 
purchase tissues. To my 
surprise, more than four 
stores within a five minute walk 
cany tissues— different brands 
and everything. Thinking ahead, 
I realized that the stores might 
be out of stock. So, in the interest 
of saving time, I faxed each store 
inquiring if they had tissues 
available.
Unable to wait for a faxed re­
ply, I included the number of my 
beeper on the page I sent. By 
this time, my nose was really 
itching for a honkering, but 
within minutes, I got a beep. I 
stepped into a phone booth for 
privacy as I dialed the number
on my cellular. The recording that 
answered offered me the option of 
checking prices, store hours, or 
inventory. I hit ‘3’ for inventory.
The recording then asked me 
which aisle the item I needed in­
formation on was located. If I was 
unsure, the recording explained, I 
could check the store’s web page 
for a detailed map of the premises. 
Realizing this would also save me 
time once I actually got to the 
store, I hurried back to my main
frame (since my laptop couldn’t 
connect me to the web) and located 
the store’s web page. Tissues were 
kept in aisle seven.
Not wanting to seem like an 
over-indulging-technology freak, I 
passed over the cellular and used 
the video phone to call the store 
back. (Since the other end was just 
a recording, advertisements for the 
store were on the screen.) I dialed 
three to get to inventory and then 
hit * 7’ to get a list of products in 
that aisle that were out of stock. 
Tissues were not on the list.

When the Student Dormitory Council members 
come together, they don’t just sit around and com­
plain about how bad the food is at their schools, or 
how annoying housing can 
be. Instead, they try to find 
out what productive pro­
grams other schools have 
accomplished.
Conferences such as the 
Mini No-Frills that SDC 
hosted last weekend bring 
people together to inter­
act and share ideas. “[The 
schools! talk over press­
ing issues that are affect­
ing them and the other 
schools in the region,” said 
Mike Sperger, SDC Trans­
portation and Security 
Chair for the Conference.
The presentations gen­
erally fall into two catego­
ries in a small meeting like 
this one: how to keep an 
organization like SDC run­
ning smoothly and what 
kinds of programs and ser­
vices, both educational and 
entertainment-oriented, 
the organizations are doing.
The presentations given at Mini No-Frills in­
cluded how to give a successfiil program presenta­
tion at a conference, discussions on SDC and RA 
interactions, and how to motivate and develop 
groups within an organization. Representatives 
from Case Western University also gave a talk on 
two programs they successfully ran in the past, 
Winter Carnival and Spring Olympics.
SDC President Austin Shifrin said his first con-
work-a big difference from often-apathetic CMU. 
“[Conferences] remind me a lot of why I got into 
this and what makes me happy about this work. 
It’s a rejuvenating experience,” he said. Sperger 
continued, “Their excitement and enthusiasm is 
contagious.”
The Mini No-Frills might not bring that same 
rejuvenation pro­
cess to the CMU 
students involved. 
“Our role is less of 
us trying to trans­
mit values and 
more of us facilitat­
ing others trading 
ideas,” explained 
Shifrin. “The im­
pact to a campus is 
more direct when 
your school doesn’t 
host [the confer­
ence].” SDC has 
brought back many 
ideas from confer­
ences in the past 
and implemented 
them at CMU, in­
cluding the popu­
lar Sex Week.
“This conference 
is going to be fran­
tic, stressful, and 
extremely tiringfor

Women’s Center literary magazine open to all
By REBECCA HERBSTER
Tartan Staffwriter
Carnegie Mellon Students now have another 
creative outlet to express thoughts about impor­
tant societal issues. A new literary magazine 
called, “Wearin’ our hand-me-downs” has 
just started publication through CMU’s 
Women’s Center. Jennifer L. Urso, a senior 
majoring in art and co-editior of the maga­
zine said, “The intent of the magazine is to 
offer a forum for differing opinions and ideas 
regarding our roles as men and women in 
our society.”
The magazine accepts all types of genre 
including poetry, fiction, essays, and news 
articles concerning men’s and women’s is­
sues. The magazine wants to become a place 
where both genders can discuss their differ­
ent viewpoints about gender roles.
The magazine, while funded by the 
Women’s Center, is not a magazine just for 
women’s issues. The co-editors feel the first 
issue got off to a rocky start because the 
magazine received submissions from women 
students, who were directly involved with 
the Women’s Center. Very few males submitted 
any writings. This is not an image the magazine 
would like to pursue. The editors want students
to know that “Wearin’ our hand-me-downs” is 
not directed toward any one group at Carnegie 
Mellon; anyone can submit their writings.
The editors plan to produce the magazine twice 
a semester. The topic for the next issue is sister­
hood and brotherhood. Because this topic is very
editor said it can be about your little brother/sister, 
or the larger issues of sisterhood and brotherhood. 
Submissions for this next issue are being accepted 
until March 8.
Urso said, “All submissions are welcomed, 
but, based on the amount of submissions we get, 
we may have to edit some.”
When asked how the magazine will ben­
efit the CMU community, Puskar said, “It 
provides a creative outlet for students in­
terested in important gender issues.” Also, 
the magazine wants to encourage students 
to get involved in the Women’s Center and 
promote its awareness. This publication 
will help students become more knowl­
edgeable of the Women’s Center and its 
valuable resources.
Janel Hanmer, a H&SS undecided fresh­
man and co-editor said, “Future issues 
may have themes such as gender roles in 
the workplace, gender roles in the media, 
and gender roles at CMU.”

CRACKING THE MYTH
By Amber Benezra
I am an informed person, totally aware of femi­
nist social issues. But reading the women’s news 
bulletin board this week, I was infuriated, horri­
fied, and overwhelmed by the violence that exists 
in the lives of women. Statistics about violence 
against women are fairly common knowledge: ev­
ery 10 seconds a woman is beaten by her domestic 
partner; one in three women will be raped during 
her lifetime. Even though these statistics are re­
flected in our media, and in our own lives, I think 
there is a general perception that things must be 
getting better by now — women are only getting 
raped and beaten by strangers in alleys, or in 
third-world countries. We have become so desen­
sitized that those statistics are only numbers, and 
we can’t believe it (or refuse to acknowledge it) 
\vhen our roommate or sister or friend is raped or 
beaten up by her boyfriend.
The central problem is that society has come to 
accept the female body as a site of violence. Vio­
lence is a vehicle for patriarchal power, a means of 
demonstrating control and power — whether it is 
perpetrated by soldiers during wartime or by a
middle-class American husband. As women, we 
learn and concede to a body-consciousness that is 
continually reminding us that we are weak, vul­
nerable, and threatened. Ask any woman if she 
has ever walked home alone at night and not been 
afraid of being attacked or raped. It is difficult to 
come to terms with this: knowing you will never be 
free of this fear. Knowing your friends and brothers 
and boyfriends can never understand what it is 
like to live with this. This violence is a source of 
oppression; it limits every woman’s freedom of 
movement and is a violation of her personal and 
physical integrity.
Thirty years ago, most violence against 
women was either ignored or just accepted 
as normal behavior, and the women’s move­
ment has done a lot to challenge this: pro­
viding services to victims of violent crime, 
educating people about violence against women, 
and creating tactics for resistance. However, vio­
lence against women, and the refusal to acknowl­
edge it as a serious social problem, is still preva­
lent. I came across this example last week on the 
Associated Press news wire:
A judge who ignored a woman’s plea for protec­
tion and released her ex-boyfriend, who then shot 
and killed her, once confided to lawyers that he had 
beaten his wife, the New York Post reported Friday.
“Even I have beat my wife! It happens, and you 
can’t always do something about it,” Judge Lorin 
Duckman allegedly told lawyers in his chambers 
during an October 1991 trial of a man accused of 
beating his girlfriend. The Post said the prosecutor 
in the case, Bryanne Hamill, told her boss, “We 
have to get him(Duckman) off the case.”
Duckman remained, and the defendant was ac­
quitted of all charges, the Post 
said. Steven Reed, a spokes­
man for the Bronx dis­
trict attorney’s office, 
confirmed that 
Duckman had said 
in his chambers 
that he had had 
personal expe­
rience with 
domestic
vio­
lence.
The 
judge has 
been under fire 
forfreeingBenito 
Oliver, after ques­
tioning how severely 
he beat his girlfriend,
Galina Komar. Three 
weeks after his release,
Komar was slain and Oliver 
committed suicide. After the 
case, Duckman was moved
to a judgeship in Brooklyn Ryan Rhoa'^7^an Art staff 
and no further action was 
taken, the newspaper said.
How can we ever hope to counter violence if
people in power insist on defending it? Because of 
this, it is our responsibility to recognize and 
refuse to accept violence against women in 
our lives, the movies we see and the rela­
tionships we have. Especially in this 
time when the political climate is in­
sensitive to issues concerning women, 
people of color, and the poor — all 
people that suffer the oppression 
ofviolence everyday. Events such 
as the international women’s 
conference are 
crucial 
methods 
for organiz­
ing against 
and resisting 
this violence. 
Recently in Arizona, presi­
dential hopeful Pat Buchanan 
called last summer’s interna­
tional women’s conference in 
Beijing a “crazy dingbat conference” 
overrun by homosexual and bisexual 
women. “It was a horrible thing, dread­
ful. It looked like the bar scene in Star 
Wars.” If elected, he said, “We’re going to 
put an end to this nonsense.” This is what 
we must fight against. The silence of 30 
years ago has been broken, and women 
must no longer let violence dominate their 
lives.

Student Sensitivity Awareness offers students support
By SHARMILA 
VENKATASUBBAN
Tartan Features Editor
It’s a meeting of the minds, a 
chance for students to meet with 
oilier students and deal with 
issues that they deal with as 
well,” said Daniella Topol, a 
senior directing major and the 
coordinator of the Student Sen­
sitivity Awareness groups, a 
support program initiated by 
various students in the drama 
department that is open to all 
of the College of Fine Arts. Con­
cerned with creating an outlet 
for students to assist others with 
problems that they might come 
across during their college 
years, the groups meet every 
Sunday between 1 and 6 pm, 
focusing on a different issue dur­
ing each hour.
It’s not about students coun­
seling students, but more im­
portantly, students helping stu­
dents,” said Anne Mundell, a 
design-in-drama professor and 
faculty link for the program.
During a series of surveys con­
ducted last year, it was found 
that students, specifically 
drama students felt a dearth of 
support for various issues that 
they face every day. “While is­
sues such as sexuality and sub­
stance abuse are widespread on 
college campuses, they are more 
visible in CFA,” Topol said.
Run by a committee of stu­
dents in the drama department, 
the Student Sensitivity Aware­
ness Committee, five major is­
sues were pinpointed: substance 
abuse, sexuality, nutrition, 
sexual assault and harassment, 
and cultural issues. “Once we 
figure out how to best break­
down the needs of student, we 
wanted to start a mechanism 
that would let us share experi­
ences and let them know the at 
they weren’t alone,” said David 
Goyette, a junior acting major 
and facilitator of the sexuality 
group.
Emphasizing that the meet­
ings aren’t geared towards 
treatment in any way, Topol 
explained that each student cho­
sen to lead a group has under­
gone some sort of training from 
the Counseling Center. “Sandra 
Kryder [from the Counseling 
Center] has been instrumental 
in teaching us the best ways to 
lead [the meetings],” Topol said.
Each meeting is structured 
differently depending on the 
issue and the type of experience 
the section head has had, said 
Goyette. “I usually start with 
an opening statement and then 
leave the floor open to any ques­
tions people might bring to the 
meeting,” Goyette said. “Ifthey 
don’t have any, I have predeter­
mined questions such as ‘how 
does sexuality fit into to our 
art?”’
Goyette finds that, in his ex­
perience, students lack gay role 
models and that only in the last 
few years has the drama de­
partment developed a consider­
able gay population. “On the 
flip side, heterosexuals benefit 
from the support sessions in 
learning how to exist within a 
sexually diverse atmosphere. 
Heterosexuals need support 
because of the ratio of homo­
sexuals to heterosexuals, you 
feel that your sexuality is caus­
ing you to be different.”
“People have preconceived no­
tions of homosexuality, espe­
cially within CFA. To top it off, 
we’re trapped in our major with 
little time to take of ourselves,” 
Goyette said.
Other groups such as cultural 
issues focus on being a minority 
in respective departments. “Am 
I minority artist or an artist 
who is a minority, is a concern 
for students,” said Topol. “By 
attending the meetings, we hope 
that students will find that 
there are others who think simi­
larly.”
Freshman director and head 
of substance abuse, Megan 
Dunleavy became interested in 
•the program due to her experi­
ences in dealing with alcohol­
ism and drug abuse. “I feel that
I can help others by sharing my 
experiences,” she said.
“The idea was that if we 
worked around drama’s busy

Students find Morewood and Mudge to 
be convenient housing, satisfying needs
MOREWOOD, from page LI
Morewood allows the residents 
to stay cloistered in their rooms, 
coming down for meals and com­
pany at the Piper’s Grill. There­
fore, many said that after two or 
three days of staying inside, they 
had to go for walks. However, 
when pressed, Demirs said that 
she would eventually live off cam­
pus, “for the experience.”
“I like our room a lot,” said 
Dorothy Ivanovich, political sci­
ence sophomore. “Almost the 
whole floor is really social.” This 
sociabilty, it seems, shone at 
Morewood. On a campus that is 
Perceived to be full of social snails, 
Morewood was full of open, 
unshelled slugs.
Full of friendly faces, televi­
sions, and relaxed RA’s, 
Morewood seems to be the per­
fect haunt. And, said Gagliardi, 
^Ve have less roaches than Welch 
and Scobell.”
“I wanted to fit my piano,” said 
freshman ChemE major Marc 
Corelli. “That’s why I came here.” 
Mudge Hall, the handsome build- 
tog on Forbes, is a large, expan­
sive complex made up of three 
wings: the older Mudge House, B 
Tower, and C Tower. The two 
towers are.traditional dorm-style 
buildings, but the center house is 
a wonder.
“Mudge dorms are nice places. 
There are nice places to study, a 
nice courtyard, and large rooms,” 
said Nathan Gill, sophomore 
MechE. He shares his large room 
with three other Sophomores. His 
room overlooked Forbes and had 
plenty of floor space for televi­
sion-watching.
“Mudge is social, but it depends 
on where you live. It’s pot luck,” 
saidfreshman ECE major Keith 
Rothschild. He lives in B Tower, 
where the halls are wide and 
quiet. “I’m not getting my money’s 
worth.” he said. His room, a prime 
double, is small compared the the 
expanses of Mudge House, and 
he didn’t seem to like the cooped- 
up nature.
The entire complex is 
incongrous, but interestingly so. 
The basements are styled after 
an Edgar Allan Poe story with 
their brick and. stonework, but
they are well lit. “The dorms and 
facilities here are much nicer com­
paratively. It’s a bit off-campus, 
though,” said JasonMartin, fresh­
man psychology major. As a mem­
ber of the University Choice pro­
gram, Martin was accepted in 
more than one college and was 
placed in Mudge with other Uni­
versity Choice students. “It’s 
quiet, butit’s social,” he said. “It’s 
a nice change from the rest of the 
campus.”
One minor point to note is a 
coldness of the space. Everyone 
has their doors closed and no 
music plays. Some of the halls 
are dim and there aren’t very 
many women living in Mudge; 
however it has its positive points.
The first and foremost of these 
points is the courtyard. This 
wooded area is a perfect verdant 
atmosphere in which to study, 
making your work seem less of a 
chore and more agrarian. And, 
it’s been said, Flashdance was 
filmed in one of those rooms.

Visiting writer shares his work with students at CMU
By AMIT KAR
;¦Tartan Business Manager
• Prominent poet and publisher Sam 
jlamill, read a selection, mostly of his 
!;own work, on Friday night in the 
jkdamson Wing. He treated the audi­
ence, mostlty writing majors, to an 
eclectic array of styles and subject 
matter, and substantiated his posi­
tion as one of the country’s leading 
poets. Hamill, who was invited as part 
of the ongoing Visiting Writers series, 
also participated in an informal ques­
tion and answer session with a group 
of CMU writing students earlier in the 
afternoon.
During his visit Hamill’s colorful 
life was the focus of as much attention 
as his poetry itself. In the mid ‘70s, he 
used $500 from a press prize he had 
won to start his own publishing com­
pany. The result was the Copper Can­
yon Press, which, according to Jim 
Daniels, an associate English profes­
sor, “is really a very prestigious pub­
lisher of poetry.” The first book pub­
lished by Copper Canyon was “Bad­
lands,” written by Gerald Costanzo, 
currently a professor of English at 
CMU. The company has become the 
largest west-coast publisher of poetry 
and will be celebrating its 25th anni­
versary by releasing an anthology of 
poems from books it has published. 
This will include exerpts from “Bad­
lands.”
Hamill also spent 15 years teaching 
creative writing in prison, where he 
was the victim of gang rape. His expe­
riences in prison were the topic of one 
of his poems. “If you want to see how 
racist this country is, the best place to 
start is in our prisons,” he said before 
reading a poem about a lonely and 
dilapid prisoner.
This was just one of the varied topics 
that Hamill covered during his read­
ing. Among the others was domestic 
violence. Hamill, a self-admitted 
former wife-batterer, now speaks out
against domestic violence, largely 
through poems such as “Naming the 
Beast,” which he recited on Friday 
night.
Hamill’s Buddhist faith also plays 
an important role in his material. “This 
is a horny Buddhist poem,” he said 
while introducing one of his pieces. 
He also reflected the Buddhist and 
Yogic practice of conducting breath­
ing exercises through chant and speech 
in some of his poems by setting meter 
and rhythm accordingly. “Poetry 
should be a Yogic exercise — your 
poem should set your breathing,” he 
said.
Hamill’s reading prompted differ­
ent responses from his audience. Alex 
Lewin, a sophomore writing major, 
said, “I enjoyed his poetry insofar as I 
am able to comprehend poetry.... It’s 
not anything that I’m going to take 
any deep and profound meaning 
from.... I enjoyed it, but I didn’t feel 
enlightened.”
“I just have tremendous respect for 
[Hamill]”, said Costanzo. “I really ap­
preciate the fact that he just really 
gave of himself to the students.” De­
spite a long and enduring friendship 
that started with the publication of 
“Badlands,” Costanzo had never heard 
Hamill read.
Hamill was the second writer to ap­
pear for the Visiting Writers series 
this semester. According to Daniels, 
the Visiting Writer series, which con­
sists of eight events, is split evenly 
between semesters and between poets 
and prose writers. Daniels said that 
the last event in the series coincides 
with the presentation of the Adamson 
Writing Awards to students and usu­
ally involves a visit by a very promi­
nent writer. This year’s Adamson 
awards will be given out on the last 
day of classes and will include a visit 
by Tobias Wolfe, writer of “This Boy’s 
Life,” which was adapted into a movie 
starring Robert DeNiro.
Attendance at visiting writers read­
ings has fluctuated tremendously since 
the program was started in 1972. 
Costanzo attributed this partly to the 
many disparate interests that mem­
bers of the CMU community enter­
tain. He contrasted the expected 
throng at a reading by Frank Herbert, 
author of “Dune,” to the unexpectedly 
large turnout at Hamill’s reading. 
“Sam Hamill has, I would say, a real 
cult following.... I was pleased with 
the Hamill turnout.” Costanzo requires 
his students to attend the readings, 
partly to overcome the problem that 
writing fame and good writing do not 
necessarily imply each other. “Some 
of the readers we’ve had have been 
just tremendous...but there was only 
a dozen or so people attending.” An­
other minor obstacle has been that 
students often have different inter­
ests from their professors. On 
ocassions when performance poets 
were scheduled to read, this disparity 
between faculty and student sbecame 
apparent. As this particular form of 
reading is not very popular with many 
professors in the department, it was 
not expected that too many students 
would be interested. But news of the 
impending performance spread among 
students by word of mouth and the 
readings proved to be very popular.
Constanzo also thinks that the in­
formal interaction with readers that 
the series affords is a great opportu­
nity for aspiring writers. “We invite 
people with an eye towards demon­
strating what the writing life is like.” 
Although the series is undoubtedly 
aimed at writing majors and particu­
larly for students of what Costanzo 
considers to be “the best undergradu­
ate creative writing program in the 
country,” both Costanzo and Daniels 
stressed that it is not limited as such. 
“Everyone is welcome,’’said Daniels. 
It’s not just an English major or cre­
ative writing thing.”

schedule, students would find the time to 
come to the meetings,” said Topol.
While four of the five groups are run prima­
rily by students, sexual assault and sexual 
harrassment is headed by Anne Mundell, a 
professor of design in drama and a trained 
sexual assault advisor. According to Mundell, 
the mission isn’t about students counseling 
students but more about identifying resources.
“To me, the programs are very exciting,” she 
said. “We’ve been trying to start programs like 
these for a while, with little success and to see 
students taking the initiative thrills the ad­
ministration.”
“The students were the impetus for every­
thing,” she added.
The last group, nutrition, tackles an array of 
concerns, from maintaining a well-balanced 
diet on a daily basis to eating disorders and 
the pressures of image, especially in the drama 
department.
“For actors a big part of the art is how you 
look, how you appear on stage,” said Topol. “So 
eating disorders do tend to develop within the 
major.”
While the groups have received no funding 
from the school, Mundell finds that CFA and
the drama department have been very sup­
portive. “Essentially Barbara McKenzie-Wood, 
Tim Satternow and myself have helped the 
students set things up. Barbara Anderson and 
Martin Precot have been really helpful as 
well,” said Mundell.
Although the program is limited to CFA, 
Topol hopes that this is only the beginning; 
that in the future every department and major 
in each college will offer such facilities, since 
the effects manifest themselves in different 
ways. “These issues aren’t unique to artists, 
but artists have a different way of looking at 
life — through their spirits and emotions.” 
The programs are open to everyone regardles 
of whether they suffer from a problem or if 
they know of someone with a problem.
“Your work is never over, you carry it around 
with you all day,” she added.
“A forum to talk and exchange ideas—that’s 
all it is,” said Dunleavy. “Very low pressure.” 
The meetings take place every Sunday in 
CFA room 102 from 1 to 6 pm.
Anyone interested in the Sensitivity Aware­
ness Groups should contact Anne Mundell, David 
.Goyette, Tiffany Trent, Stacey Swift, Megan 
Dunleavy, Jodi Baker, or Daniella Topol.

Do a fi'ttie dance,j
By TRACY ODELL
Tartan Staffwriter
The formal season is upon us as 
students across campus search 
through the mothballs for their 
fanciest duds and leaf through 
their little black books for the 
perfect date. Though fraternities 
usually hold their formais a bit 
later in the season, sororities and 
other organizations are fighting 
the winter blahs with a night of 
dressing up and getting down.
The formal season got its start 
on February 10th when the Soci­
ety of Women Engineers held 
their Winter Ball at Pittsburgh 
Athletic Association. The same 
night Alpha Epsilon Pi (AEPi) 
celebrated at Holly Hills Inn and 
Golf Center.
This past weekend, Kappa Al­
pha Theta partied Friday night 
at the Athletic Association and 
Delta Gamma held their “Cream 
Rose Formal” Saturday night at 
the Lemont on Mount Washing­
ton. More formais are going on in 
the next few weeks including 
Spirit’s “Love Overboard” clipper 
ship cruise.
Though the particular organi­
zation may have specific tradi­
tions it follows at the events, all 
formais proceed in approximately 
the same manner. The first step
for a formal goer is finding a date. 
The date is not necessary, just 
simply preferred. Few are brave 
enough to face the formal scene 
stag. Senior Ellie Hasenkamp, a 
chemical engineeringmajor, tried 
to put together a stag table for 
the Delta Gamma formal last 
Saturday night, but “it just never 
worked out.” Perhaps guys are 
less shy about being dateless be­
cause at the AEPi formal several 
brothers went dateless, accord­
ing to Mark Roden, freshman bi­
ology major.
The cost of the night is often of 
major concern, especially seeing 
how every college student seems 
to whine daily about how poor he 
or she is. Typically, tickets for the 
night cost about twenty dollars 
per person and include dinner. A 
thirsty formal goer must shell 
out big bucks since any drinks 
must be purchased at a cash bar. 
The romantic date will spend even 
more dinero on a corsage or bou­
tonniere. One may also have to 
make allowances for transporta­
tion, dry-cleaning, or buying 
something snazzy and new to 
wear.
Dress, though formal, seems to 
border on conservative. Girls 
typically wear their most elegant 
dresses with the overwhelming 
majority choosing the regulation
‘little black dress.’ Guys have 
fewer options. They can go with 
the less formal jacket and tie, the 
slightly more formal suit, or if 
they are feeling especially saucy, 
a tuxedo. The tux is a convention 
rarely seen at the formals, except 
in the case of AEPi where all 
brothers wore them on their big 
night.
The menu shows little varia­
tion from one formal to another. 
After the salad and appetizer, be 
prepared for chicken of some type, 
unless you opt for the vegetarian 
dish. At the Spirit formal there 
was a more varied spread, as they 
offer a buffet with several main 
dishes and plenty of side dishes. 
Then of course there is always 
the temptation of some delectable 
dessert, if any room is left in your 
constricting new attire.
After dinner comes the danc­
ing. The DJ is usually open to 
requests as the bodies groove on 
the dance floor. Typical dance 
favorites are mixed with slow 
tunes to provide the correct blend 
of fun and romanticism and keep 
everyone happy. Much in the tra­
dition of Cinderella, when the 
clock strikes midnight, the en­
chanted evening is over. Some­
times small groups get together 
afterwards, but the basic trend is 
to split up when the music stops.
Anyone in the mood for getting 
dressed up and dancing the night 
away still has plenty of opportu­
nities. Fraternities and sorori­
ties will continue to hold formals 
over the next few months. If you 
are not in a Greek organization, 
there is the Spirit formal on Feb­
ruary 23. In the past the formal 
was only for members of the Spirit 
organization, but as RosalynRice, 
sophomore history major, ex­
plained, this year everyone is in­
vited. The celebration has 
changed its emphasis from Afri­
can American heritage to one of 
cultural unity. The cost is twenty 
dollars per couple and transpor­
tation to the clipper ship is pro­
vided.
Though there are the occasional 
horror stories that follow every 
formal, most seem to have a good 
time. If nothing else, the food is 
probably going to be good and you 
will have material to gossip for 
hours the next day about who 
was wearing what and who 
danced with whom. Besides, you 
get to leave campus, show that 
you really do have table man­
ners, and practice your mingling 
skills. Of course, you may be broke 
for a month or two afterward, but 
judging from the popularity of 
formals, the money is well spent.

DIVERSIONS
Students finally get a chance to relax and chat after hours of 
Preparation.
By AMANDA SPEAR
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
“Pssst... did you see what she 
was wearing? Let me tell you, 
that dress leaves nothing to the 
imagination! And he’s no better 
in his plaid ruffle shirt and white 
tux. Ugh, talk about bad taste.” 
Familiar words? If you’ve got 
eyes in your head and any fash­
ion sense, no doubt, you have had 
thoughts in a similar vein. 
Formals are the perfect place to 
check out everyone and what 
they’re wearing, especially if your 
date is too drunk to dance. In 
fact, formal wear is often charac­
terized by its tackiness — bright 
orange sequins, yards of South­
ern Belle lace, ties with light-up 
tropical palms, and powder blue 
suits. On the other hand, there 
are those who know what looks 
good and aren’t afraid to wear it.
Vanessa Altman-Seigel, a 
sophomore writing major, knows 
what she likes: “Very sleek, mod­
ern clothes. Black dresses with 
no silly bows or decoration. Maybe 
a low back, thin straps... simple.” 
Simplicity is the buzz word of 
90’s dressing— if you ignore the 
sudden revival of crazy clashing 
prints by Gucci and the like. We’re
still recovering from shoulder 
pads and armfuls of bangle brace­
lets. Personal style is more im­
portant these days than what is 
the latest trend — at least, it 
should be. Some people appar­
ently insist on the latest trend, 
even if it means being a D cup 
wearing baby tees.
There are stories galore about 
dresses falling down, but this one 
takes the cake. Alexis Sottile, a 
sophomore BHA student, tells of 
the girl who took 70’s revivalism 
a little too far.
“She got this dress, I don’t know 
where, her attic maybe, that was 
so Farr ah Fawcett. It had spa­
ghetti straps that were almost 
invisible, was floor length and 
clingy. It was pale yellow and had 
this stripper triangle bikini type 
top. She got out on the dance floor 
and suddenly, her boobs flopped 
out of the middle of her top. She 
tried to stuff them back in right 
there.”
Where do people get their for­
mal wear here in hip Pittsburgh? 
Michelle Allen, a junior IM ma­
jor, suggests department stores 
such as Kaufmans. “They’ve got 
okay stuff, especially if you wait 
until they have a sale. It might be 
a dress for a winter formal and
it’s spring, but you can always 
wear it next year.” Other sugges­
tions included Crimes of Fash­
ion, Lazarus, Saks, Eons, and the 
Goodwill.
Phoebe Papageorgiou, a sopho­
more H&SS student, likes to shop 
at out of the way places. “Who 
wants to look like everyone else? 
When you go to places like Eons 
you can find an awesome vintage 
dress that looks so great on you 
and be sure you don’t look like a 
clone.”
I would have to agree with that 
statement, as one of my favorite 
shopping sites is the Goodwill. 
By shopping in used clothing 
stores, you can find a bunch of 
interesting pieces and put them 
together, just the way you want 
it. If you find something that is 
wonderful and it doesn’t fit, get- 
tingit altered won’t put too big of 
a dent in your pocket, since the 
dress or skirt or whatever prob­
ably didn’t cost more than $20.
Unfortunately for guys, there 
isn’t too much variety in formal 
wear — a white tux, black tux, 
plain cummerbund or plaid, ruffles 
on the shirt or no ruffles. You get 
the drift. On top of that, it’s expen­
sive to rent a tux. One dapper 
young man had the sense to buy
his own tux. Mike Gartland, a 
senior writing major, realized it 
was cheaper in the long run to buy 
instead of rent. “I don’t know what 
prompted it, but I own a tux and 
have probably saved money. I got 
it at a used clothing store. Plus, I 
can wear it whenever I want to 
pretend I’m James Bond.”
Josh Prinsky, a senior physics 
major, claims that a tux isn’t al­
ways necessary. “You know, if 
you’re just going to a semi-formal, 
or even a formal, a nice suit is all 
that’s needed. If you were going to 
the Inaugural Ball, I’d recommend 
a tux.”
Hafeez Raji, a junior designer, 
thinks that it’s possible to relieve 
the monotony of a suit or tux. 
“Good hair is one way to stand out. 
A weird pair of shoes or some­
thing,” said Raji.
It’s all about what you like. Just 
because some magazine has pages 
devoted to simplicity doesn’t mean 
you can’t go all out and go for the 
Tammy Faye look, if you like to 
add two pounds to your weight 
every time you wear make up. 
Wear what is comfortable and 
makes you feel like a million bucks. 
Create your own look, go nuts, be 
understated, just do it for you and 
no one else.

Pittsburgh Finally Has A Low-Fare Airline.
Our Promise To Pittsburgh: “Low Fares Every Day, Everywhere We Fly.”
If you’ve ever wished airfares were lower, your 
time is coming. Because on March 1, Valujet will begin 
flying three daily nonstops to Atlanta. And ever)' seat on 
ever)' flight is just $59 for travel through March 31,1996. After 
that date, fares as low as $59 will still be available with a 21-dav 
advance purchase. Seats are available now.
From Atlanta you'll be able to make convenient, 
low-fare connections to seven sunny Florida cities, for fares 
as low' as $79. You can also connect through Atlanta to cities 
around the south, including New' Orleans, Savannah, and 
Dallas-Fort Worth. And you may find that the great, big 
airlines will lower some of their fares to those destinations 
now' that Valujet’s come to town. Which is why we say,
“The fare's not fair, unless Wlujet flies there.”
Whaf’s A Valujef, Anyway?
Valujet is an Atlanta-based airline founded on the 
principle of offering low airfares and friendly, enthusiastic 
service. We don’t have a First Class section, we won't serve 
airline food, and we can’t fly you to Europe. But our low fares, 
positive attitude, hassle-free “ticketless” reservations system, 
and lack of restrictions (Valujet never requires a roundtrip 
purchase or a Saturday night stay,) have resulted in such a high 
degree of customer loyalty' that Valujet has been described 
as, “the most successful start-up in airline histon'. ”
We invite you to find out why for yourself.

Stones still got it goin’ on
jjy ERIC SALZMAN
far tan Personnel Manager
“You wanna go see Mick and 
he boys?” my friend Tanya asked 
last year when I was abroad in 
\ustralia. “Sure,” I said, nothav- 
ng the slightest clue what she 
vas talking about. “OK, well have 
¡o take a train,” she told me.
Who: Rolling Stones 
I What: Stripped 
j Company: Virgin 
Records
So, a couple of weeks later, I 
i/as on an overnight train from 
Jydney to Melbourne to cover the 
irst Australian Rolling Stones 
jress conference in 17 years. It 
;eemed like as good a reason as 
my to go to Melbourne. I didn’t 
eally care too much about the 
jand— after all, they’re over the 
,ill, right?
I don’t think so. The guys in 
;his band are about as hip as it 
rets. They played the media bet- 
er than they do their instru- 
nents. When asked about their 
jlans for the future, Mick J agger 
. they were just looking for a 
rig for the next year. All they are 
s a blues/rock band looking for a 
¡tage to make a few bucks from. 
Jranted, they’ve made a few mil­
lion, but they’ve kept the heart 
and soul of their music all the 
way through to their most recent 
release, Stripped.
With a status big enough to 
let them indulge a bit in non­
mainstream efforts, the Stones 
have done just that on Stripped, 
their new album on Virgin 
Records which is a sort of “un­
plugged” compilation album of 
some of their lesser known clas­
sics recorded in concert or re­
hearsal. You won’t find their 
biggest hits redone, “Satisfac­
tion,” “Jumping Jack Flash,” 
“Sympathy for the Devil,” and 
“Paint in Black” are not the 
songs that this album is about.
Stripped is more about blues 
than rock, more about rehash­
ing lost favorites than redoing 
saturated pop-hits. The most 
quickly paced song on the al­
bum is the opening one — 
“Street Fighting Man.” It gets 
you a little too pumped up for 
the songs to follow, but it is a 
strong number. Whether they 
meant it as a tribute to Bob 
Dylan or to themselves, in the 
next songthe Stones perform 
Dylan’s classic “Like a Rolling 
Stone,” which Jagger fitfully 
ends with, “Thanks, Bob.” The 
lyrics made me laugh a bit, but 
at the same time, the band does
the song justice.
Some of the album’s other 
highlights include a version of 
“Angie” that would make Tori 
Amos proud and Jagger’s voice 
soaring through “Wild Horses.”
| R''d Fnurno Wmomiq: WxFx
For a bunch of guys in their 
fifties, the Stones remain solid 
as ever, if not more so. Jagger’s 
voice has actually improved over 
the years (thankfully) and Keith 
Richards remains as charming 
as ever. This album gives him a 
chance to shy away from rock n’ 
roll and really do some nice 
funky blues work. So if you are 
one of those judgmental critics 
who thinks because a person 
has reached a certain age he 
can’t make good music, grow 
up. The Stones are still around 
because they are great.
Laughter lightens up Yard
By TREVOR ME YERO WITZ
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Comedian Rob Weinstein put 
on a brilliant performance at 
Scotland Yard on Friday night.
The Yard was overflowing 
•with, people who were thor­
oughly enjoying themselves. 
Rob almost had to do a second 
show to accommodate the num­
ber of people who showed up to 
see his act.
Lincoln Westfall, a freshman 
’ ECE major who sat in the front 
row, said, “His continuous 
stream of clever jokes and com­
ments had me laughing out loud 
the whole time.”
Weinstein has appeared nu­
merous times on Comedy Cen­
tral and regularly tours col­
leges.
In his act, Weinstein touched 
on a variety of issues ranging 
from college life to politics to 
his belief that dentists are the 
ultimate evil. His witty obser­
vations provided a fresh and 
hilarious perspective about ev­
eryday life.
He brilliantly pointed out the 
fallacy of assuming that TV com­
mercials are real. “If you ever 
think your life sucks, just think 
about Juan Valdez. Juan hand 
picks every single Colombian cof­
fee bean at the top a mountain 
with only the help of a mule.” said 
Weinstein during his perfor­
mance.
“I think the show went well... 
it was one of the brightest and 
most open audiences that I’ve 
played on any campus anywhere. 
Obviously they wanted to laugh, 
or needed to laugh. I think they 
got the things that I wanted them 
to get,” said Weinstein.
Weinstein’s act is well suited for 
the college scene. ‘You’ve got to 
think if you want to watch my act. 
That’s why I don’t put it in front of 
as many audiences as I used to, 
where they're not there to think,” 
said Weinstein.
Many of his jokes required the 
audience to have some knowledge 
of academia and current events. 
For example, in one part of his
routine, Weinstein suggested 
dumbed down course captions 
at colleges so that students 
would understand them, call­
ing Psychology, “Drugs,. Rats, 
and Crazy People,” and calling 
Geometry, “Angles and Things,” 
to name a few.
Weinstein also talked about 
some things that only students 
would understand, like cram­
ming for a test the night before. 
For example, he once tried to do 
his plant growth lab, which in­
volved trying to grow a com 
stalk, the night before it was 
due.
Weinstein has been a come­
dian for eleven years. He began 
by writing jokes and doing 
stand-up at his college, Syra­
cuse University. After college 
he took some comedy courses 
and became a professional co­
median.
His comedy was thoroughly 
entertaining. Our activities fee 
was put to good use in paying 
for Rob Weinstein’s perfor­
mance.

The pure white winter snow, a 
lifeless arm, and blood — that is 
our first glimpse into the world of 
Before and After. It is a world 
where things are about to become 
drastically different and not ev­
erything is as it seems.
I What: Before and After 
\ Director: Barbet
Schroeder
I Company: Hollywood 
Pictures
That said, just because some­
thing is not as it seems 
does not mean that we 
cannot discern its true 
nature. This is the case 
with Before and After, for 
although the action on 
the screen throws many 
twists at us, they can be 
seen coming from quite a
distance. : _______
Jacob Ryan (Edward - nHBH 
Furlong) is a sixteen year old com­
ing of age in suburbia, until one 
day he disappears. Why he does so 
is apparent from the instant we 
see the blood on the snow. Is he a
blood and body belonged to his 
girlfriend, Martha Taverner, 
whom he had not even told his 
parents he was dating. Does this 
figure into his reaction as well?
Jacob’s parents love and protect 
him heavily, with a force that 
seems too strong at times. His 
father goes so far as to destroy 
evidence rather than have the po­
lice seize it and use it to possibly 
convict his son. While it is logical 
that a father would wish to protect 
his son, it is unbelievable that he 
would go to such lengths and have 
such a firm belief in his son’s inno­
cence. How can he ignore the blood 
in his son’s car? Perhaps part of
"Before and After is an enjoy­
able movie, but nothing distin­
guishes it from the swelling 
tide of films dealing with moral 
dilemmas."
the answer can be found inhis own 
guilt arising from the memory of 
the fight he had with his son the 
morning of the death.
The reaction of the townspeople
killer, or has he simply seen too to the situation is assuming Jacob take emotional scenes. This is evi-
ttuch? This is the question that 
his parents, Carolyn (Meryl 
Streep) and Ben Ryan (Liam 
Beeson), must answer. When he 
finally does come home to face 
criminal charges, he stares 
catatonically at his parents and 
cries while watching static on the 
television. We later learn that the
guilty. They protest outside the 
county jail where bail is set, advo­
cating that he be kept in prison 
until the trial, as well as attacking 
the physical belongings of the 
Ryans, although the point of this 
is unclear.

Bad flick worth forgetting
By W. LABEEKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Reworkings of genre conven­
tions in film are very popular in 
these days of pulpy hack-works 
and lawyer-come-writer savvy. 
At this point, the repertoire for 
any genre is so big that self- 
conscious filmmakers strip the 
genre down to its clichés and 
mistake the package for the con­
tent. The genre that has suf­
fered the most from this vul­
garizing superficiality is the 
film noir.
What: Unforgettable 
Director: John Dahl 
Company: MGM
Film noir is not about cheat­
ing dames, big cars, flimsy 
schemes or private eyes. It is 
not a bunch of plot devices 
thrown in a certain way. It is 
about an atmosphere, if you 
will, the mundane and treach­
erous dark side of people. Mov­
ies that explore this aspect of 
the genre have become so rare 
that when one pops up, it is 
promptly in idiotically dis­
missed as existential film noir.
In the last few years, besides 
xeroxed direct-to-video cook- 
ups and true gems of the genre 
like Miller’s Crossing, a notable 
piece of noir called Red Rock 
West came up. Directed by John 
Dahl, this movie featured Nick 
Cage as a drifter that gets into 
plenty of trouble when he runs 
into a contract killing, some
long-lost money and — last but 
not least —Dennis Hopper. What 
made Red Rock West stand up 
between the sea of similar medi­
ocrities — besides the excellent 
performances—was the unusual 
dead-pan feel the action had and 
the sense that the story was point­
ing at something that was a little 
below the stormy surface of plot 
twists.
Dahl followed this pretty little 
nugget with “The Last Seduc­
tion.” An immensely entertain­
ing movie, it featured the almost 
historic performance of Linda 
Fiorentino as the modern- day 
cheating dame that gets away 
with drug dealing, murder, and 
being the heroine. Besides giving 
Fiorentino a cult following, it re­
affirmed Dahl’s talent as a writer/ 
director in this weary genre, now 
given true hope beyond the nos­
talgic puns and slick irony of other 
recent offerings.
Now comes Unforgettable, a 
movie that represents a milestone 
for Dahl in that it is the first 
movie of his that gets a theatrical 
release before getting thrown to 
video. It is also the first Dahl 
movie not scripted by himself.
Unforgettable is the tale of a 
medical examiner (Ray Liotta) 
who sets out to prove that he’s not 
his wife’s murderer. He does this 
by injecting into his bloodstream 
a drug invented by a mousy neu­
robiologist (Linda Fiorentino) 
which allows memory transfer 
via spinal fluids. Pretty soon, the 
plot twists abound and the game’s 
afoot. Stuff like this could make a 
decent and innovative noir piece, 
but here the results are disap-
pointing.
Dahl’s first mistake was prob­
ably to work with a hack writer. 
This writer simply lifted up the 
script for “The Fugitive” (down 
to the opening scene), added 
some trendy sci-fi, a couple ex­
tra plot twists, cut down on the 
chases and presto, a script even 
Dahl would have trouble mak­
ing into a decent movie. Dahl’s 
second and only unforgivable 
mistake here was to render the 
memory retrievals with the 
way-overused style of bright- 
light jump-cuts seen every­
where from commercials to 
MTV to bad shrink movies. The 
plot device of memory retrieval 
is an excellent opportunity to 
explore some unusual and pro­
vocative film narrative and ex­
pose some questions about re­
ality and memories, but Dahl 
wasted this opportunity. Per­
haps it was studio pressure (this 
is his first big-studio feature), 
or perhaps he wasn’t in the 
mood, but it is still a darn 
shame.
It is still an amusing piece of 
work and again you get the feel­
ing now and then that Dahl 
wanted to hint at something 
else. Actually, most of the fun of 
Unforgettable comes from 
watching Fiorentino as a nerdy 
scientist. It is regrettable that 
her talent and Dahl’s were 
thrown into the studio system. 
Dahl admits that he was naive 
enough to believe that he could 
just go to Hollywood and make 
a movie. Let’s just hope he wises 
up and gets the hell out of that 
town.
Bronx gets mixed reviews

Fans of Jackie Chan, pay at­

his parents or his sister. Still, he 
doesn’t seem to do anything with

Do you enjoy the excitement of a close race? 
Well, we have the excitement and thrill that you’ve been looking for!
Sweepstakes races (more commonly known as buggy races) are a Carnegie Mellon 
Carnival tradition that dates all the way back to 1920. It began as a demonstration of 
mechanical skill and dexterity, and has since evolved into a competition of design, 
technology, and quickness. Each entry in sweepstakes is comprised of 6 team 
members - five pushers and a driver. This is where you come into the picture...
My organization is searching for a buggy driver. We have an excited team that is 
committed to racing hard and competing to the very best of our ability!
So, if you’re 5'2" or less, of a small and compact build, and interested in the 
excitement of driving buggy, please give me a call at 862-3898 or send me email 
at mr5d+@andrew.cmu.edu.
Please feel free to contact me even if you’re not sure about driving but are interested 
in learning a little more about buggy before you decide. I’d be more than happy to 
discuss the thrills and benefits of driving buggy with you.

movies you may have seen before....,

Fellini Satyricon
If you are color blind, you might want to skip this 
one. Fellini Satyricon is all about contrasting 
colors, so you might miss the whole movie. There 
are all these neat things in there, like a white boat 
on a black sea. Hey, wasn’t that the premise to Love 
Boat? Just sailing along in really pretty environ­
ments. Unfortunately, you won’t see Isaac or Cap­
tain Stubing in this film, because this isn’t The Love 
Boat. There probably won’t even be a special guest 
star who comes aboard.
Many people who have seen this film opened their 
eyes during the film as to see the entire movie. I 
suggest you do the same. There are many things in 
this movie worth looking at, so take along someone 
else with eyes, so they can enjoy it too.
A', 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.

The Usual Suspects
Who would you expect to see in this film? A bunch 
of regular guys? Some shifty, beady-eyed charac­
ters? Kevin Spacey? Sure, I bet they’re all in there, 
doing all sorts of nutty, goofy things. Like this one 
guy, who hires some generic thugs to kill his family 
(the yellow pages really do work) and then kills 
everyone just to prove how much of a tough guy he 
is. He still looks like a pansy to me.
Try watching this movie backwards. You won’t 
see any Satanic messages, but you will probably get 
dizzy and see something weird. Not weird like a 
man in a dress (which is still weird, no matter what 
people say), but weird like watching a movie back­
wards. If you fall down, stare at the ceiling and 
admire the wonderful lighting. Anyway, see this 
movie because I’m sure something interesting hap­
pens.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Goldfinger
¦ This is one of them crazy James Bond flicks, with 
plenty of guns, cool contraptions, and lusty babes. 
It stars Sean Connery, the original shaken-not- 
stirred man, which you will probably know best 
from his many Tonight Show appearances. There 
are tons of swell inventions in this movie, all made 
by the mysterious Q. Yep, Q’s been making the 
rounds lately. After his stint on Days of Our Lives, 
he moved on to bigger and better things, like mak­
ing nifty toys for James Bond. Then he did the 
whole Star Trek thing, you all know about that. It 
all started because he was jealous of R. R and S and 
E were on Sesame Street all the time, and no one 
seemed to care about little old Q.
This movie should be loads of fun, with plenty of 
death and maiming. Check it out, and bring some­
one who can spel.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

The Thing (1982)
This movie is a lot like Octopus Tag. You remem­
ber this game? One person, who’s it, runs around to 
tag people, and when they catch someone, they have 
to join the it person (we’ll call them “thing”) and tag 
people. Except in this movie, they play tag on the 
North Pole, and the people who are not the thing 
have flame-throwers. I think this version of the 
game is called Siberian Rules Octopus Tag. Also, 
make sure never to play this game with Kurt Russell, 
he’s really good at not getting tagged.
The Thing was directed by John Carpenter. It is 
a remake of an old movie, that was also called The 
Thing but was not directed by John Carpenter. 
There was a singing group called The Carpenters, 
but I don’t think they were related.
At 5, 7:30,10 pm, and 12:30 am.

On Sunday, February 18, the 
fifth concert of the Y Music Soci­
ety recital series took place in 
Carnegie Music Hall on Forbes 
Avenue. World-renowned cellist 
Ralph Kirshbaum took the stage 
to perform music by Bach, Beet­
hoven, Brahms, andLutoslawski. 
Having performed with the 
world’s leading orchestras and 
soloists, Kirshbaum has estab­
lished himself as one of the great 
modem day cellists. A known 
advocate of English and 20th 
Century music, Kirshbaum has 
recorded the great cello works of 
composers such as Barber, Elgar, 
and Walton. His performance 
that evening, however, might 
have been more successful had 
he chosen Britten instead of 
Brahms.
Kirshbaum began with Bach’s 
Suite No. 2 in D minor for Solo 
Cello (BWV 1008). Perhaps the 
truest indicator of a cellist’s tal­
ent, the Bach Cello Suites are 
known as a landmark of both 
musical ingenuity and technical 
virtuosity in the repertoire. Al­
though Kirshbaum’s playing
seemed quite beautiful through­
out the first three movements 
(Prelude, Allerftande, Courante), 
his ability to sustain a definitive 
voice quickly diminished as he 
struggled throughout the more 
contrapuntal Sarabande and 
Menuets. By the time he had 
reached the final Gigue, 
Kirshbaum’s playing had dropped 
to an adequate but uninspired 
level. For those who wish to ex­
perience a performance which 
transcends those of mere mor­
tals, the new EMI Mstislav 
Rostropovich recording of the 
Bach Cello Suites will not disap­
point (Kirshbaum would be well 
advised to listen).
The next work on the program 
was the Brahms Sonata No. 1 in E 
minor for Cello andPiano(Op. 38). 
Another war-horse in the cello rep­
ertoire, this piece acts not only as 
a testament to the sheer beauty of 
the cello but as one of the few 
works by Brahms that is not com­
pletely soporific. Although the 
piece provided Kirshbaum with 
an opportunity to redeem himself, 
it was the accompanist, ironically 
enough, who delivered the most 
exciting performance. Peter 
Frankl, an acclaimed pianist in
his own right, brought true depth 
and exceptional grace to the piece, 
successfully animating every bar. 
Unfortunately, 
the combina­
tion of his 
sound with 
Kirshbaum’s 
playing seemed 
awkward and 
somewhat dis­
connected, and 
I felt as if they 
were rushing to 
finish the per­
formance.
One would 
hope that an 
intermission 
would give a 
struggling per­
former the op­
portunity to re-
VIn1 Tau8 Cau1ao 
9aoarmu
gain his composure. In most per­
formances, however, the events 
of the first few minutes predict 
the outcome of the entire evening. 
For Kirshbaum, this was all too 
true. His performance of 
Lutoslawski’s Grave, a “Meta­
morphoses for Cello and Piano” 
was the obligatory (and unneces­
sary) 20th-century addition to the 
evening. I cannot wholly blame
Kirshbaum for the considerably 
less than stunning affect of this 
composition, for its tiresome 
atonal romps and cha­
otic melodic frag­
ments fail to make a 
coherent musical 
whole.
On a much simpler 
level, his playing of 
the Beethoven So­
nata No.3 in A major 
(Op. 69) was offen­
sively boring. It 
would take great 
imagination to de­
vise a duller cham­
ber music experi­
ence.
For his encore, 
Kirshbaum gave a 
DqMnomMM refreshing rendition 
of the Debussy So­
nata for Cello and Piano, but it 
was simply not enough to offset 
the previous two hours.
In the future, perhaps 
Kirshbaum will perform works 
he feels more comfortable with, 
such as the Barber Sonata for 
Cello and Piano. In the mean­
time, one should approach his 
Bach, Beethoven, and Brahms 
with caution.

the world, so huge that 
he’s been dubbed the 
world’s biggest action star. 
In the U.S. he’s not quite 
as popular, but he does 
have a definite cult fol­
lowing. His style, however, 
may not appeal to the ma­
jority of American audi­
ences, now or ever.
The ads for this movie 
play off the fact that Chan 
does all of his own stunts. 
This is incredible, espe­
cially when you see the 
beatings that he takes (he 
even broke his ankle in 
this movie and continued 
to film). Still, the movie 
itself is nothing short of 
ludicrous. This might ap-
peal to many, but unless 
you are a fan of Jackie 
Chan or a fan of Kung Fu 
type movies, you probably 
won’t do much more that 
laugh at this movie. The 
acting is horrendous, right 
down to every last extra 
and the entire movie is 
dubbed badly. Many 
people think that’s what 
makes this type of movie 
so great, but it takes a cer­
tain kind of mentality to 
accept that a movie is go­
ing to be bad and then still 
enjoy it.
I must admit that Chan 
has tons of charisma and 
charm. I think Imight have

story, acting and dialogue.
But like I said, if you go for 
this sort of thing, then definitely 
don’t miss your chance to see it 
on the big screen. Some of the 
cinematography is very good 
and it’s sort of thrilling to see 
Chan in action. There’s also a 
hovercraft in the movie which 
ends up being a lot of fun to 
watch. The best part of the 
movie comes at the end when 
they show a bunch of outtakes 
from the filming of the movie. If 
you are looking for something 
more sophisticated, however, 
and can’t bringyourself to check 
your brain at the door then-I

On the Tube
by Dan Rosenberg
Let’s face it — last year’s 
Grammy Awards sucked. There 
were blatant omissions among 
the nominees, and many deserv­
ing winners were not called to the 
podium. To make matters worse, 
the Academy gave Sheryl Crow 
Record of the Year for her dread­
ful “All I Wanna Do” and cut 
Frank Sinatra off in the middle of 
his acceptance speech. Had Bruce 
Springsteen not won Song of the 
Year for his exceptional “Streets 
of Philadelphia,” the evening 
would have been a total waste.
What a difference a year makes. 
Having realized the error of its 
ways, the Academy completely 
revised its nominating process, 
resulting in one of the best crops 
of nominees in Grammy history. 
Nearly every contender deserves 
his or her place among the nomi­
nees, and most winners will prob­
ably deserve their respective ac­
colades.
Wednesday night, when the 
statues are presented on CBS, 
expect repeated trips to the po­
dium for Mariah Carey, Joan 
Osborne, Alanis Morisette, TLC, 
and Shaniah Twain. Carey will 
undoubtedly win Album of the
Year for Daydream, her most criti­
cally praised recording to date. 
Even more certain is her victory 
for Record of the Year. “One Sweet 
Day” is not only a lovely ballad 
about a dead friend, but it fea­
tures the pop diva performing 
with Boyz II Men. The other nomi­
nees don’t stand a chance.
Song of the year is a bit more 
competitive, but I believe that 
Osborne’s “One of Us,” a song 
about God written by Eric 
Bazilian will take the honor. “One 
Sweet Day” isn’t nominated and 
Osborne’s ballad is more thought- 
provoking than all of the other 
nominees combined. “One of Us” 
should also earn Osborne the fe­
male pop vocalist accolade, and 
will probably gain her the New 
Artist trophy as well.
Although Morisette ties Carey 
for the most nominations (six), 
she will probably be shut out of 
the top categories. She will, how­
ever, dominate the rock catego­
ries, winning three honors: for 
her debut album Jagged Little 
Pill and for performing and co­
writing her ballad of betrayal 
“You Oughta Know.”
TLC, meanwhile, should sweep 
the R&B categories, winning best 
album {Crazy Sexy Cool), song 
(“Creep,” written by Dallas Aus­
tin), and performance (for 
“Creep”). Twain, meanwhile, 
should take the same honors in 
the country category, for The 
Woman in Me and its hit single 
“Any Man of Man,” which Twain 
co-wrote.
While hot newcomers like
Osborne, Morisette, TLC, and 
Twain will earn nearly a dozen 
accolades among them on 
Wednesday night, seasoned vet­
erans will be called to the stage 
as well. Frank Sinatra is the front- 
runner in the traditional pop per­
formance category, and has a 
narrow victory over fellow leg­
ends Julie Andrews, Rosemary 
Clooney, Eartha Kitt, and John 
Raitt. The Eagles will win best 
group performance in the rock 
category for “Hotel California,” 
but will lose in the pop competi­
tion to the red-hot Hootie and the 
Blowfish. Nirvana will win its 
final Grammy for their perfor­
mance on MTV Unplugged, while 
R&B legends Anita Baker and 
Barry White should narrowly 
edge out their talented competi­
tion, including Carey, Brandy, 
the artist formerly known as 
Prince, and Stevie Wonder.
Like Springsteen’s “Philadel­
phia,” songs from movies will earn 
a significant number of awards. 
“Kiss from a Rose,” (from Batman 
Forever) which is nominated for 
both Song and Record of the Year 
should earn Seal, its performer
and writer, the male pop vocalist^ 
honor. Meanwhile, Coolio is a ;; 
shoo-in for best solo rap perfqg§£ 
mance for “Gangsta’s ParadisC";^ 
1995’s number-one single which 
was featured in the movie Dan­
gerous Minds. Pocahontas’ “Col­
ors of the Wind,” meanwhile, will | 
win best song written specifically j 
for a motion picture, just like it ; 
will at next month’s Oscar cer- j 
emony.
Other individuals or groups | 
who will probably be called to the ! 
podium Wednesday night: Pearl ! 
Jam for best hard rock perfor- ! 
mance; the great Jonathan Win- ; 
ters for best comedy album; 1 
Michael and Janet Jackson for ; 
best music video for the costly j 
“Scream”; Daydream as best pop j 
album; Neil Young for male rock j 
performance; and Naughty by i 
Nature for their rap album j 
Poverty’s Paradise.
Of course, nothing is certain j 
until the envelopes are opened j 
Wednesday night, but judging by j 
the quality of nominees, I am ! 
sure that the Academy will do ! 
itself proud and honor the most 
deserving contenders.
