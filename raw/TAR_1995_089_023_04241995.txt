Student Senate breaks bylaws
Role Models instructs children outside on the Cut. The program dealt with a setback this week after 
the assistant director resigned.
Ass’t. director of Role Models 
program announces resignation
By EDWARD HAYES
Tartan News Editor
On Tuesday, April 18, at 8:15 
pm, John Lawrence Jordan III 
resigned as assistant to the di­
rector of the Role Models pro­
gram for reasons which are un­
clear.
Jordan, a jun­
ior IM/H&SS 
track student, an­
nounced his res­
ignation in a let­
ter emailed to 
members of Role 
Models as well as 
other prominent 
faculty members 
including Robert 
Mehrabian, president of the 
University and Michael 
Murphy, dean of Student Af­
fairs. “I feel the time has come 
for me to leave the program,” 
Jordan said in the letter.
The letter was, for the most 
part, positive. Jordan ex­
pressed the loss he would, feel 
after leaving the program. “I 
am truly going to miss all of 
you, but most importantly, I 
am going to miss all the chil­
dren in the program.”
Although the letter did not give 
a reason for the resignation, he 
told The Tartan that he no longer 
wanted an administrative posi­
tion.
Jordan declined to comment 
further. In his letter, Jordan did
express some dissatisfaction with 
the program. “The Role Models 
Program has gone through major 
changes over the past semester. 
Some changes I feel were for the 
better, and some changes I feel 
were for the worse.”
Jennivere Kenlon, an unde­
clared freshman who left the pro­
gram last semester, said, “I might 
go back next semester now that 
[Jordan’s] gone.”
Kenlon said that he dealt with
different types of people differ­
ently. “I was very uncomfort­
able there,” she said. “The at­
mosphere was not very condu­
cive to working with kids.
It was very political.” Mem­
bers of Role Models were either 
unavailable for comment or re­
fused to com­
ment on 
Kenlon’s re­
marks.
Jordan ex­
pressed opti­
mism for the 
Role Models 
program in 
his letter. “I 
envision the 
Role Models 
program over the years grow­
ing to even great-er heights.” 
Jordan praised Elaine 
Atkinson the founder and di­
rector of the program and asso­
ciate director for University 
Outreach. “[Her] main purpose 
of starting the program was to 
help children develop a founda­
tion of knowledge to make in­
telligent decisions that benefit 
them today and in the future.” 
Atkinson refused to comment.
“I envision the Role Models pro­
gram over the years growing to 
even greater heights. ”

The Political Speakers Forum Board 
(PSFB), WRCT Radio, and The Student 
Union went before Student Senate last 
Tuesday for the final stage of the budget 
hearing process. The meeting was held 
to grant these groups the opportunity to 
refute the budget cuts proposed by the 
Senate Funding and Recognitions Com­
mittee (F&R). However, questions arose 
as to the legality of Senate’s Tuesday 
meeting in light of their oversight of 
several governing bylaws.
It was announced at the meeting that 
Senate may have violated Article VI 
SectionXV, Subsection E of their bylaws 
which states, “At the end of the commit­
tee budget hearings, all organizations 
requesting subsidies from the Student 
Activities Fee will be listed in The Tar­
tan and The Student Union along with 
the subsidies recommended by the Sen­
ate Funding and Recognition Commit­
tee and the date for the Student Senate’s 
hearing of budgets.”
Upon this announcement, Senate 
Chair Burt Holzman moved to have a 
five minute recess with F&R Chair Merle 
Atkinson. Atkinson said he had sent 
jmaii to the leaders of several student 
organizations on Sunday which he felt 
justified not advertising the budget hear­
ings or specific subsidies in either of the 
student publications. After some debate
from the floor, Holzman ruled that 
Atkinson’s email had fulfilled the “in­
tentions” of the bylaws.
“I hate when these kind of things hap­
pen,” said Holzman afterwards. “We 
weren’t trying to deceive the public. All 
of the organizations were informed — 
the only exception I can think of is PSFB 
... as far as I can tell we just overlooked 
[that section of the bylaws].”
Holzman felt that if the bylaws had 
been followed “to the letter,” the budget 
hearings would have been a “disaster” 
because the new Senate would have to 
vote on the budget package — a respon­
sibility he felt they would not be ad­
equately trained to handle.
Senate also violated their bylaws when 
they voted to suspend fiscal policy. Ar­
ticle VI, Section XXIV reads, “Student 
Senate can override Article VI (Student 
Senate Fiscal Policy) with a two-thircls 
(2/3) vote, provided at least one (1) week’s 
notice has been given of the proposed 
override.” However, fiscal policy was 
suspended at Tuesday’s meeting — not 
a week in advance as mandated by the 
bylaws. No vote can be seen in the min­
utes of their last session, thus suspend­
ing fiscal policy at Tuesday’s meeting 
violated their bylaws.
The Student Union
The Student Union was told last week 
that their printer would not make a bid 
on their contract for the next fiscal year.
They also disputed Senate’s cuts to their 
budget, a proposed $4,000. However, no 
one from The Student Union was present 
at Tuesday’s meeting. Atkinson said he 
did not contact Lenny Young, The Stu­
dent Union's Business Manager, “until 
Sunday because I didn’t know what 
would happen. It’s very possible Lenny 
didn’t read his email.”
SLA Senator Brendan Mielke proposed 
an amendment to accept the proposed 
budget and added if The Student Union 
could not find a printer by May 31, their 
budget would be voided. Senate voted to 
give The Student Union until Septem­
ber 1. Atkinson said he would contact 
Young with the results of Tuesday’s 
meeting and said he’s happy with the 
decisions, “because it gives them the 
summer [to sign a new contract with 
another printer.]”
“I’ve never been able to make Senate 
meetings because I have rehearsal,” said 
Young, who is a graduate student in 
Music. He also said, “I couldn’t find 
anyone to go at that time.” The Student 
Union’s budget has been finalized Young 
said, “We’re used to cutting corners, we 
just want to get the paper out.” He said, 
“I still have not sat down with Merle to 
see what they have and haven’t cut out.” 
The Student Union attempts to pro­
duce^ 6 issues each year. This year, they 
only put out a total of four. During bud­
get talks between The Student Union

SDC drafts ‘No Smoking’ policy
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Copy Manager
The Student Dormitory Coun­
cil (SDC) has developed a new 
smoking policy for residence halls 
which bans smoking in all such 
buildings, but allows for the es­
tablishment of smoking lounges, 
if they prove feasible. The policy 
will take effect as of August 1,
1995, but is still subject to discus­
sion and amendment at Wednes­
day night’s SDC meeting, which 
will take place in Doherty Hall 
1212 at 7 pm. SDC is planning on 
handing out copies of the policy 
through resident assistants to­
day or tomorrow.
Section I.A of the policy reads 
There will be no smoking within 
all Residence Halls, inclusive of 
common rooms, stairwells, hall­
ways, and rooms,” while section 
I B reads, “If the air around such 
residence hall lounges can be 
maintained to meet or exceed 
Occupational Health and Safety 
(OSHA) air quality standards, one 
(1) or two (2) smoking lounges
“[Junior physics major] Doug 
Brady, as the housing chair [of 
SDC], is kind of our liaison to the 
Housing and Residence Life of­
fices,” Shifrin said. “He told us 
they field a lot of complaints from 
residents about... incidents that 
were not against the rules, but 
were invading their space and 
the right to maintain a smoke- 
free environment,” such as prob­
lems with ventilation, people liv­
ing in suites, and smoke drifting 
across halls.
Health reasons seemed to be a 
key issue in the discussion at last 
Wednesday’s meeting.
“Our mission here is to protect 
the rights of the students ... in 
this case the health of the stu­
dents,” Brady said during the dis­
cussion.
David Potter, the director of 
Housing at CMU, said at the 
meeting that Housing surveyed 
about 8-10 colleges for their 
smoking policy, and found that, 
while “most schools mirror what 
we’re doing, schools that are 
Please see SMOKING, page 3
may be planned, with proper ven­
tilation, in each Residence Hall 
at the discretion of the Director of 
Housing, the SDC President, and 
SDC Housing Chair.”
Should the plan Drove unfea­
sible for 1995-96, the policy says, 
it will go into effect “at the close of 
University Housing at the end of 
the 1995-96 academic year.” 
Recent complaints from non­
smoking residents complaining 
about smoke prompted SDC to 
look into changing the current 
policy, which allows smoking in 
private rooms, accordingto sopho­
more psychology major Austin 
Shifrin, the SDC president.

Oklahoma City explosion kills 81; 150 still missing
OKLAHOMA CITY, April 23
— The flag at Carnegie Mellon 
flew at half-mast Sunday, to 
honor the victims of the Okla­
homa City bombing.
On Wednesday, an explosion 
rocked a federal office building 
in downtown Oklahoma City, 
blowing a portion of the front of 
the building away.
The force of the explosion, 
which took place shortly after 9 
am EDT, could be felt as far as 
30 miles away.
A man who was in a meeting 
at the Journal Record Building 
about two blocks away said the 
force of the explosion blew 
people out of chairs.
With 81 people dead and 150 
still missing, this was the dead­
liest civilian bombing in U.S. 
history. Over 400 others were 
injured in the blast, which was 
caused by thousands of pounds 
ofhomemade explosives packed 
into a Ryder rental truck.
A suspect in the bombing, 
Timothy McVeigh, was in the 
El Reno Federal Correctional
Center pending court hearings 
Thursday. McVeigh was charged 
Friday night, with “malicious 
damaging and destroying, by 
means of an explosive, a building 
or real property, whole or in part, 
possessed or used in the United 
States.” Other charges were ex­
pected to follow. The government 
has said it will seek the death 
penalty.
Two other men, brothers James 
and Terry Nichols, are being held 
in custody as material witnesses, 
but not as suspects.
On Sunday, an AWOL soldier 
was taken into custody. But the 
government said he is not the 
square-jawed, dark-haired sus­
pect pictured in the FBI sketch 
flashed around the world.
David Iniguez, who was AWOL 
from Fort Riley, Kansas, was 
picked up in California in connec­
tion with the attack, Justice De­
partment spokesman John 
Russell said.
CBS said Iniguez resembles 
“John Doe 2,” the dark-haired 
man in one of two FBI sketches
issued Thursday. But Russell 
said: ‘It’s not John Doe 2, and I’m 
not sure if he’s going to be ar­
rested or not” in the bombing. “If 
he has military charges against 
him, I can’t verify that.”
President Clinton saidhe would 
not rule in or out a foreign con­
nection during a press conference 
on Friday.
Reporters asked whether for­
eign connections to the bombing 
incident had been ruled out now 
that suspects have been identi­
fied who do not appear to be for­
eigners, and various reports now 
link the bombing incident to 
American terrorists.
“I never, and the Justice De­
partment never, said it was a 
foreign agent that bombed the 
federal building in Oklahoma 
City,” Clinton said. He added that 
“there’s still a lot ofworkneeded,” 
and “we shouldn’t assume” any­
body from beyond U.S. borders 
was involved.
On Saturday, about 100 fed­
eral agents searched a Michigan 
farm owned by James Nichols for
bomb-making materials in a 
painstaking hunt for clues to the 
bombing.
Agents climbed ladders to ex­
amine the farm’s three large 
metal silos while others used dogs 
trained to sniff out explosives. 
Official cars and vans crowded 
the area in front of the neat, white- 
frame farmhouse while a police 
helicopter circled overhead.
The New York Times, in its 
Sunday edition, said dozens of 
federal agents had descended on 
Kingman, Ariz., McVeigh’s last 
known address, and the sur­
rounding high desert, which is a 
training site for the self-styled 
Arizona Patriots paramilitary 
group.
Neighbors saidboth the Nichols 
brothers and McVeigh had spent 
time at the farm and may have 
had ties to right-wing paramili­
tary groups.
The FBI said the three men 
were also believed to have served 
together in the army.
The Nichols brothers and 
McVeigh have been linked in
news reports to right-wing groups 
with extreme anti-government 
views.
A lawyer for McVeigh said Sat­
urday he would ask to have the 
case moved out of Oklahoma City 
because it would be impossible 
for his client to get a fair trial.
“I don’tseehowthisyoungman 
can possibly get a fair (hearing) 
from any grand jury in Oklahoma 
City,” John Coyle, a criminal de­
fense attorney, told CNN. He said 
he would apply in federal court 
Monday to have the case moved.
On Sunday, work crews using 
sophisticated camera equipment 
said they found heat spots in the 
rubble of the Alfred P. Murrah 
federal building — but believed 
that instead of signs of life, the 
cameras were depicting heat gen­
erated by decomposing bodies.
President Clinton and evange­
list Billy Graham were to lead a 
huge prayer service Sunday be­
ginning at 4 pm EDT at a fair­
ground in northern Oklahoma 
City.
Officials said they expected
large crowds and were tryingto 
find overflow areas where tele­
vision monitors could be in­
stalled.
City Mayor Ron Norick sug­
gested that bells be rung across 
the United States as a sign of 
hope for the families waiting to 
hear the fate of missing loved 
ones.
Oklahoma City Assistant 
Fire Chief Jon Hansen and 
Oklahoma Governor Frank 
Keating said they were not giv- 
ingup on finding someone alive, 
even though no survivors have 
been dug out of the building 
since Wednesday night.
Officials feared the missing 
were trapped in thousands of 
tons of twisted metal and bro­
ken concrete.
During the night Saturday 
and early morning Sunday, the 
rescue work had to be halted 
several times to allow construc­
tion engineers to reinforce the 
broken pillars which are hold­
ing up what remains of the 
building.
Thousands dead in refugee camp
KIGALI, Rwanda, April 23 (D J) — On 
Sunday, shooting erupted again in a 
refugee camp where at least 5,000 people 
were killed by Rwandan soldiers or 
trampled in stampedes a day earlier.
There were no immediate reports of 
new casualties, said U.N. spokesman 
Barney Mayhew in Kigali.
The U.N. High Commissioner for Refu­
gees said between 5,000 and 6,000 people 
were killed and thousands more injured 
jwhen the refugees made an escape at­
tempt from the Kibeho camp on Satur­
day. U.N. officials said that unconfirmed 
reports have the death count as high as 
8,000.
; UNHCR spokesman Ray Wilkinson 
¡said, “One of our people on the ground 
inside the camp reports walking by piles 
and piles and piles of dead bodies.”
The U.N. military spokesman in Kigali 
'said the victims died from gunshots, 
machete wounds, bayonets, and gre­
nades. Others were trampled or crushed.
! “Rwandan soldiers have been seen 
burying the victims with shovels and 
hoes,” he said.
Radio Rwanda said that “criminals” 
inside the camp provoked clashes with 
security forces. It said the instigators 
•killed 35 people with machetes and also
attacked the army. It cited no fatality 
figures.
In a radio interview, Rwandan Prime 
Minister Faustin Twagiramungu prom­
ised to take action if an inquiry proves 
soldiers planned the attack. He said the 
investigation would show “whether it 
was a case of self-defense or premedi­
tated violence.” The prime minister put 
the death toll at 4,000.
Mayhew said that around 2,000 
wounded people are still in the camp, 
and plans are being made to evacuate 
them to other areas inside Rwanda.
It was reported that the roads from 
the camp were clogged with tens of thou­
sands of people trying to flee the site. 
Most were heading east on roads that 
rain had turned into virtually impass­
able quagmires.
Saturday’s violence began in the morn­
ing when refugees, apparently seeking 
cover from the rain, tried to run through 
a cordon of soldiers surrounding the 
camp. “This spooked the soldiers, and 
they started firing into the crowd,” 
Wilkinson said. Then some people in­
side the camp, presumably Hutu mili­
tiamen, began firing at the soldiers with 
small arms, Wilkinson said. The sol­
diers “responded to that with heavy 
mortars,” he said. “As the confusion then 
became total chaos and panic, a large 
number of people, mostly women and 
children, were trampled to death.”
Four dead in N.J. plant explosion
LODI, N.J., April 21 (DJ) — An early 
morning explosion in a chemical factory 
and resulting fire forced evacuations of 
about 400 people before being brought 
under control.
The fire injured at least eight workers, 
some who were badly burned, and a 
handful of neighbors. Four workers were 
killed.
The blaze at the Napp Technologies 
Inc. factory on Main Street was reported 
at 7:47 am EDT, Bergen County police 
said.
Lt. Charles Cuccia of the Lodi Fire 
Department, which is headquartered 
opposite the plant, said the explosion 
was the result of mixing of chemicals.
The plant makes pharmaceutical prod­
ucts and chemicals. Authorities were 
urging borough residents to close their 
windows and keep pets inside as a pre­
caution.
There was concern about chemical 
runoff into the Saddle River. Depart­
ment of Enviromental Protection offi­
cials said they found dead fish in the 
river and distressed wildlife nearby.
Eight workers were taken to 
Hackensack Medical Center. Four were 
admitted, including one man in ex­
tremely critical condition with bums
over 90 percent of his body. Several area 
residents also were treated.
North Korea to re-open talks
TOKYO, April 22 — On Saturday, 
North Korea left open the possibility 
that it could resume talks with the United 
States on the deal to end North Korea’s 
nuclear program.
A statement by the North Korean for- 
eignminister said Pyongyang was study­
ing a proposal by the United States to 
hold talks after meetings between tech­
nical experts broke down this week.
The talks stopped over North Korean 
opposition to South Korea supplying 
reactors to replace Pyongyang’s present 
models, which produce plutonium that 
could be used in nuclear weapons. “Just 
after the negotiations broke off, roving 
ambassador of the U.S. State depart­
ment, Robert L. Gallucci,. proposed po­
litical talks with the DPRK (North Ko­
rea) in the first week of May in Geneva,” 
a foreign ministry spokesman said.
Cult responsible for two attacks
YOKOHAMA, Japan, April 21 — On 
Friday, a poison-gas attack sent Japan 
into a panic for the third time. The
attack coincided with signs that police 
were close to acting against a doomsday • 
cult linked to an attack one month ago 
on the Tokyo subway.
In the most recent incident, 25 people ; 
were taken to the hospital after being I 
overcome by fumes in a Yokohama store, i 
a change of target from two previous 
attacks on Japan’s subway system.
Prime Minister Tomiichi Mur ay am a j 
told reporters, “This attack is trouble- \ 
sorfie. I want authorities to tighten secu­
rity.”
The store was only 300 yards from 
Yokohama’s main train station, where 
many of the 500 people stricken by gas 
on Wednesday had been waiting for \ 
trains.
Doctors said the store victims had the 
same symptoms as those in Wednesday’s ] 
attack, complaining of a sore throat, ! 
burning eyes, and nausea.
“It’s very scary. I thought Wednesday’s 
incident could not repeat itself,” said a 
20-year-old college student. “Now I know 
it could happen again and again. I don’t ! 
want to think about it.”

Greek community increases membership by two
Panhel votes Yes on local sorority
By HEATHER ZINDLE
Tartan Staffwriter
Last Sunday night,, the 
Carnegie Mellon Panhellenic 
Council accepted Zeta Psi Sigma 
(Zeta Sig) to be a part of Panhel. 
The Carnegie Mellon Panhellenic 
Council bylaws say the local or­
ganization has to have notified 
the council of its inception, and 
can then be recognized five se­
mesters followingthe notification. 
Each existing National 
Panhellenic Conference sorority 
must have total membership 
equal to at least four-fifths of 
ceiling, which is set by CMU at 
50. It is strongly recommended 
that the petitioning organization 
have total membership equal to 
at least two-thirds of ceiling, 
which is 33.
Right now, Zeta Psi Sigma has 
28 sisters, four of which will be 
graduating this spring. Zeta Sig 
was required to submit a written 
constitution and written state­
ment of purpose to the 
Panhellenic Council. This is the 
first semester Zeta Sig has peti­
tioned to be included in Panhel.
The decision came late Sunday 
evening. Jennifer Mack, presi­
dent of Zeta Sig was happy about 
the decision. “We are absolutely 
thrilled to have this happen. 
“We’re looking forward to the fu­
ture.”
The other CMU sororities were 
very pleased about Zeta Sig*s ac­
ceptance. “Personally, I know 
some Zeta Sigs and I think they’re 
great girls,” said Anne Marie 
Mewherther, president of Delta 
Delta Delta, “I would like to see a 
fifth sorority on campus.” Zeta
Sig will have a lot of assistance as 
they start out. “We’re very ex­
cited about having another group 
in Panhel, and ... we’re going to 
assist them in any way that we 
can,” said Holly Erdelyi, presi­
dent of Delta Gamma.
Sorority sisters look at Zeta 
Sig*s acceptance as a bright out­
look for the future. “Zeta Sig will 
be a strong edition to the 
Panhellenic Council,” said Kris 
Hinrichs, president of Kappa 
Kappa Gamma, “Members of Zeta 
Sig are very active on campus 
and their enthusiasm will be an 
asset to the Greek community.”
Zeta Psi Sigma was founded in 
1992 by six CMU women who 
had been initiated into Chi Omega 
the year the chapter was closing. 
Mack said they have always be­
lieved that recognition in some 
form was important to their fu­
ture. “For almost two years now, 
we have been out on our own, 
holding our own Rushes, and com­
municating with Panhel every so 
often. Little or no effort was made 
by Panhel to address our con­
cerns and questions about the 
bylaws.”
One of Mack’s main goals be­
came working for better relations 
with Panhel. This resulted in new 
bylaws which were passed on 
April 3. On April 10, Zeta Sig 
formally applied for recognition 
as part of Panhel.
Mack feels that Zeta Sig is “a 
positive force for women on this 
campus in the same way that the 
National sororities are. We place 
great emphasis on academic as 
well as personal excellence. And, 
finally, we are growing. I think 
that it is time to realize that we
aren’t going anywhere, and we 
want to be a part of one of the 
best things for women on the 
CMU campus, there are so few 
women on Panhel.” Being a part 
of Panhel would allow Zeta Sig 
to be included in all Greek ac­
tivities, including Greek Sing 
and Carnival.
Anna Lorch, the president of 
Panhellenic Council, said, “Alot 
of people are concerned whether 
we can handle a fifth sorority. 
It’s not an issue of individuals, 
but what’s going to happen to all 
of the houses.”
If the same number of women 
rush and join sororities as have 
in the past, the numbers are 
split more, because there are 
more houses. There is also con­
cern because Chi Omega lost 
their charter just a few years 
ago.
Lorch also said that “the goal 
is to have every house up in 
numbers, for a strong sister­
hood.” She also feels that rela­
tions between Panhel and Zeta 
Sig are at the best they have 
ever been and both sides are 
determined to keep relations 
good.
The Panhellenic Council must 
have a 2/3 majority for the local 
organization to be recognized as 
a member of the council.
Each sorority has one vote, 
which they determine as a house, 
thus three out of four must vote 
in favor of Zeta Sig in order for 
them to be recognized by Panhel.

Fraternity looks to colonize at CMU
By SAMEER KARIM
Tartan Staffwriter
Sigma Phi Epsilon National 
Fraternity (Sig Ep), the second- 
largest fraternity in the nation, 
is planning to return to Carnegie 
Mellon University next year 
after the fall Rush period. Sig 
Ep previously had a chapter at 
CMU from 1925-1937. The In­
terfraternity Council voted 
nearly unanimously to allow 
them to colonize here.
The fraternity was founded 
in 1901 in Richmond, Virginia. 
It now has 273 chapters nation­
wide with over 15,000 under­
graduates, giving Sig Ep the 
largest undergraduate member­
ship in the nation with over
160,000 living alumni.
Mike Foster, president of 
Delta Upsilon, feels that Sig Ep 
is a “pretty good fraternity 
across the nation. [It’s] one of 
the biggest [and] seems pretty 
solid.” Foster, a junior physics 
major, said, “everyone is look­
ing forward to having another 
fraternity on campus.”
Matt Willard, president of Phi 
Kappa Theta, said, “The frater­
nity system has been having 
problems in the recent past, with 
Alpha Tau Omega and Pi 
Lambda Phi. This may be a way 
to give us a little shot in the arm 
where we can see some growth 
in a new direction.” Overall, 
Willard was happy about hav­
ing Sig Ep join the current fra­
ternities on campus.
Willard said that Sig Ep’s 
pledging seemed “more like boy 
scouts than a fraternity.” In this, 
he meant that “it is a growth
process in which the members of 
the fraternity will be expanding 
through public service and per­
sonal enrichment.”
One month prior to the coloni­
zation period, Sig Ep will recruit 
and develop alumni and commu­
nity boards. For colonization, the 
fraternity sends two staff mem­
bers to campus for two weeks.
Tim Foster, director of Resi­
dence Life, felt that it is nice that 
the Greek community sees a new 
fraternity as strengthening the 
Greek system rather than weak­
ening it.
However, Sig Eps will bring 
more points of introspection for 
other houses; they will look at the 
way Sig Ep does things and see if 
it would be appropriate for them 
to adopt the same style.
Tim Foster is excited that Sig 
Ep approached Carnegie Mellon 
with hopes of colonizing. He said 
that this is the first time in recent 
history that a fraternity has come 
here, rather than a group of stu­
dents asking to be chartered by 
the fraternity.
“Having another house on cam­
pus will add a little more diver­
sity [to CMU]; it will make the 
Greek system a little stronger,” 
Mike Foster said. Overall, he felt 
that this will be a positive thing.
Though some feel that there 
are already enough fraternities 
on campus, he feels that “CMU is 
diverse enough that you need 
more than 13 chapters.”
‘The Balanced Man Project” is 
the education program for mem­
bers of the fraternity. It was first 
implemented in the fall of 1992. 
Sig Ep provides a mentoring pro­
gram for all of its members
through the duration of member­
ship. The project also requires 
that each brother fulfill a certain 
number of hours of community 
service. “The Balanced Man 
Project” has a progression of chal­
lenges that each member goes 
through, depending on age and 
experience. The “Sigma Chal-; 
lenge,” lasting from four to si* 
weeks, provides an assimilation 
period for each member. The “Phi 
Challenge,” which lasts from 
twelve weeks to one year, focuses 
on expanding the brotherhood 
beyond the chapter.
The “Epsilon Challenge,” also 
from 12 weeks to one year in 
length, challenges its members 
to fulfill an individual service 
project. The “Brother Mentor” 
challenge, lasting for the remain­
der of the undergraduate career 
of the student, provides for men 
to be leaders of the chapter and 
community.
The final challenge, the “Sig Ep 
Fellow” pushes members to de­
velop an extended service project, 
not to be less than 500 hours. To 
be recognized as a Fellow is the 
highest honor of a Sigma Phi 
Epsilon brother.
Mike Foster said that “having 
another house on campus will 
add a little more diversity [to 
CMU], it will make the Greek 
system a little stronger.” Overall, 
he felt that this will be a positive 
thing. He also said that, in gen­
eral, fraternities are “similar to 
other organizations, but frater­
nities have traditions and his­
tory that other organizations 
don’t necessarily have. [Also, we 
have] bonds throughout the coun­
try with other brothers.”
CMU in BriefSDC proposes smoking ban in dorms
CMU names commencement speaker
Emmy Award-winning actor Jack 
Klugman will deliver the keynote ad­
dress at Carnegie Mellon’s 98th com­
mencement ceremony on May 21.
Klugman, a member of the CMU class 
of 1948, is best known for his role as 
Oscar Madison in television’s “The Odd 
Couple,” which ran from 1970 to 1975 
and for which he earned two Emmys. A 
role in the 1960s television series “The 
Defenders” earned Klugman his first 
Emmy.
Klugman has also appeared on Broad­
way, including roles in a 1952 revival of 
“Golden Boy” and in 1987’s “I’m Not 
Rappaport.”
Recently, Klugman has been travel­
ing to speak on behalf of the American 
Cancer Society. First diagnosed with 
cancer in 1973, Klugman lost his right 
vocal cord in 1989. He has since become 
an outspoken role model for cancer sur­
vivors.
Poet to. speak at Award Ceremony
Award-winning author Robert Creeley 
will be the featured speaker at this year’s 
Adamson Awards, CMU’s most presti­
gious award for writing. The readings 
and ceremony are open to the public and 
will take place in the Adamson Wing of 
Baker Hall.
Creeley is best known for his work in 
poetry. He will be reading from his lat­
est volume of poetry, which is titled 
Echoes. He has also produced a signifi­
cant amount of prose, including a novel, 
The Island, and a collection of stories, 
The Gold Diggers.
He is also known for his collaborations 
with artists in other fields, including 
two records with jazz composers and 
musicians Steve Swallow and Steve 
Lacy. Additionally, he has worked with
the alternative mix rock group Mercury 
Rev.
He has received many international 
and national honors, including the 1995 
American Award in Poetry.
CMU announces Dunlap winner
The winner of the 1994-1995 Elliott 
Dunlap Smith Award for Teaching and 
Educational Service in H&SS is John H. 
Miller, assistant professor of economics 
and social sciences.
Miller joined Carnegie Mellon in 1989 
as assistant professor for the depart­
ment of social and decision sciences and 
began by teaching a variety of courses. 
In the years since then, he has emerged 
as a respected teacher and a master at 
course innovation and student motiva­
tion.
Miller’s success comes not only from 
his dedication but also from his range of 
novel teaching techniques. In one of the 
first courses he taught, as Steven 
Klepper, acting department head, writes, 
“John introduced experiments into the 
curriculum and later went on to comput­
erized tournaments. In these experi­
ments, the students are participants in 
a game. The students play the game and 
then attempt to explain the outcome of 
the experiment using simple but elegant 
abstract theories. Designing such ex­
periments can be quite challenging and 
time-consuming, but when an experi­
ment is well-designed, the students’ be­
havior conforms closely to the theory 
one is trying to teach.”
In a memo announcing the award, 
H&SS Dean Peter Steams said, “John’s 
dedication to the training of students in 
areas both within and beyond the scope 
of coursework is truly extraordinary. 
His students learn course substance, 
but also how to think for themselves and 
apply what they’ve learned much more 
broadly. I am delighted that this award 
recognizes John.”

SMOKING, from page 1changing [policies] are banning smok­
ing.”
Dan Zabell, a junior English major 
who is an RA in Donner Hall, said even 
though he smokes, he felt smoking should 
be banned if lounges are not possible.
SDC discovered that the CMU Stu­
dent Handbook said they have the right 
to modify the smoking policy. They held 
a meeting to discuss changing the policy 
last Wednesday, and then Brady and 
sophomore chemical engineering major 
Sonia Chandra, next year’s housing 
chair, worked up a new policy. Shifrin 
said he hopes as many students as pos­
sible will take a look at the policy, and 
make their opinions known to SDC.
“We put out PR trying to bring people 
to [last Wednesday’s] meeting to hold a 
general discussion about it, to try and 
get a fair idea of the feelings of the whole 
campus. The turnout to the meeting 
wasn’t as strong as it could have been, 
[so] we are now trying to bounce some of 
this information back out to people a 
little more at their convenience. We just 
want to try and reach as wide an audi­
ence as we can right now,” he said.
He said that trying to reach students 
for their input was very difficult.
“In other issues ... we have tried to 
work from a standpoint of bringing our 
information and questions to the stu­
dents,” he said. “That has proved very 
inefficient and not as workable. We are 
trying the alternative of trying to bring 
the students to SDC. I will admit we 
didn’t have as strong a turnout as we 
would like [at last Wednesday’s meet­
ing], but in light of the turnout we did 
have I would say this policy is fair.”
Shifrin said SDC tried to take the 
views of both smokers and non-smokers 
into account, but said part of the prob­
lem was that few smokers attended the 
Wednesday meeting.
“We are definitely paying very careful 
attention to the needs of students who 
choose not to smoke,” he said. “To smok­
ers, what I want to say is that there was 
a strong faction against any real allow­
ance to smokers, and I think it was a 
fortunate show of objectivity on the part 
of those people that the policy coming 
out of that still attempted to provide 
smokers with the right to continue to 
[smoke], because we are looking into the 
viability of their lounges.”
The viability of those lounges is part of 
the problem, he said, because their cre­
ation might take more time than the 
August 1 implementation allows for.
“We’re not at all very well aware of 
what the time scheme is that’s neces-
Proposed Smoking Policy
Because of a growing concern among residents about the safety of the air they breathe 
in the Residence Halis, the Student Dormitory Council proposes the following Smoking 
Policy for all Residence Halls:
i. Restriction
I.A. There will be no smoking within all Residence Halls, inclusive of common rooms, 
stairwells, hallways, and rooms.
I.B. If the air around such residence hall lounges can be maintained to meet or exceed 
Occupational Health and Safety (OSHA) air quality standards, one (1) or two (2) 
smoking lounges may be planned, with proper ventilation, in each Residence Hall
at the discretion of the Director of Housing, the SDC President, and SDC Housing Chair.
II. Enforcement
II.A. All Resident Assistants, Community Advisors, Desk Attendants, Desk Managers, 
representatives of the Office of Residence Life, and representatives of Campus 
Security will have the authority to enforce this policy.
I I.B. We would ask residents to feel free to report violations of smoking policy to any of 
the authorities above.
ill. Penalties
III.A. For the first smoking policy offense, a resident will incur a fifteen (15) dollar fine 
payable through the Residence Life Office.
III.B. Further offenses will carry an incremental fine based on: $15 + $10 per additional 
offense, payable through the Residence Life Office.
III.C. If this policy is violated repeatedly (4 or more times), the Office of Residence Life 
will call a Judicial Board hearing to review the offenses.
Ili.D. Fines shall go to Carnegie Mellon's Emergency Medical Service (EMS) in orderto 
improve their emergency response on campus.
IV. Application
IV.A. This policy will take effect on August 1,1995, unless deemed to be unfeasible by 
the Director of Housing.
IV.B. If not judged to be feasible by the Director of Housing, this policy will go into effect 
at the close of University Housing at the end of the 1995-96 academic year.
sary to research [lounges],” he said. “The 
interesting thing was that to ban smok­
ing in a universal sense was one of the 
few options that was sensible for imple­
menting next year because it was... one 
of the few options open to us that didn’t 
conflict with the way people had chosen 
their rooms for next year. If the research 
needs to continue past the time that 
people are already in housing, I don’t see 
that as a problem.”
Shifrin did admit that he thought the 
proposal might spark a lot of discussion 
and debate, but said SDC was not final­
izing anything until at least Wednesday’s 
meeting, when amendments and other 
discussion would be considered.
“I anticipate things getting pretty 
hairy once the information goes out,” he 
said, “but one of the points that I’m 
trying to get across the most is that... 
nothing is set in stone, and I want to 
encourage [people] to speak to their rep­
resentatives if they have an objection to 
the policy.” On Wednesday, a vote will 
be taking place, under two restrictions: 
only the petitioned members of SDC will
be voting, and it is not strictly a vote just 
to pass or fail the things you have writ­
ten right now but will allow for discus­
sion, amendments, and tabling all or 
part of the policy. The policy also deals 
with enforcement, something Shifrin 
said has been a weakness with the cur­
rent policy. Resident assistants, com­
munity advisors, desk attendants, desk 
managers, Residence Life representa­
tives, and campus police officers will 
have the authority to enforce the policy. 
The policy calls for “a fifteen (15) dollar 
fine payable through the Residence Life 
Office.... Further offenses will carry an 
incremental fine based on $15 plus $10 
per additional offense, payable through 
the Residence Life Office.” The policy 
also calls for a Judicial Board hearing 
for those who violate the policy more 
than four times. Fines will be donated to 
the Carnegie Mellon Emergency Medi­
cal Service, according to part III.D of the 
policy. “The enforcement mechanism 
needs to be forceful,” Tim Foster, the 
director of Residence Life, said at 
Wednesday’s meeting.

"Being a sex radical means being defiant as well as deviant. It means being aware that there 
is something dissatisfying and dishonest about the way sex is talked about (or hidden) in daily 
life. It also means questioning the way our society assigns privilege based on adherence to its 
moral codes, and in fact makes every sexual choice a matter of morality. If you believe that 
these inequities can be addressed only through extreme social change, then you qualify as a 
sex radical, even if you prefer to get off in the missionary position and still believe there are only 
two genders."

The Tartan • Carnegie Mellon University • 24 April 19955
Student Senate passes budgets, ratifies elections
BUDGETS, from page 1
and F&R, questions over The Student 
Union’s Constitution and structural or­
ganization also arose. “I can understand 
them being fiscally conservative,” said 
Young, “especially if an organization 
isn’t providing the service they’re sup­
posed to.
PSFB
PSFB was founded in 1988 and was 
created under the Student Senate be­
cause Senate does not fund political or­
ganizations. PSFB also appears in the 
Senate bylaws. Two representatives from 
Senate and four representatives from 
the general student body serve on the 
PSFB. PSFB’s funds go to 
paying honorariums to 
speakers who come to cam­
pus and speak on a wide 
variety of political issues, 
and for food and accom­
modations. The speakers 
that are brought to cam­
pus cost around $3,000-
4,000 with an additional 
$700 for expenses. This — —
year, PSFB operated on a 
$21,000 budget. Nex year, they will be 
just over $15,000.
In the past, PSFB has prepared its 
own budget, but this year, Teresa 
Leonardo, PSFB’s Chair, and a Junior 
Biology major said “I was completely 
shocked to find that it had been pre­
pared for us.” PSFB will only receive 
$15,365 for next year, an increase in 
Senate’s original proposal of $12,365. 
Leonardo said, “[We] will do our best to 
get funding from alternate sources, to 
find co-sponsors for our events, and to 
recruit lecturers through more innova­
tive ways.”
Senate was questioning the structure 
of PSFB’s organization, and at a meet­
ing with F&R Leonardo said, “[We were 
told that PSFB did not have to worry 
about the budget submittal deadline and 
that we would discuss that aspect of the 
situation personally.” One week before 
the last Senate meeting, Leonardo was
told that her budget was prepared by 
Gosden, and had been cut to $12,000.
On Sunday, April 16, Leonardo was 
given a copy of her budget and was told 
the Senate meeting on Tuesday was her 
only chance to argue against the pro­
posed two-thirds cut. At Tuesday’s meet­
ing, Leonardo said she was disappointed 
that there was not much discussion about 
PSFB. She said, “It would seem that 
their desire to get through the meeting 
on Tuesday night took precedence over 
any issues of ethics, responsibility, or 
logic which might have arisen.”
Anat Gal-Or and Douglas Hudson, the 
Senators elected to PSFB for next year, 
spoke with Leonardo during the meet-
"# hate when these kind of things hap­
pen ... we weren’t trying to deceive 
the public.”
— Burt Holzman, 
Chair of Student Senate
ing. Gal-Or proposed they allocate an 
additional $3,000 to PSFB and the mo­
tion was passed. Leonardo said, “If any 
of the members of the Political Speakers 
Forum Board had been consulted when 
our budget was being prepared and de­
cided upon by the student government, 
we would have fought...”
WRCT
WRCT radio is another organization 
funded by the Student Activities Fee. 
After submitting thier budget to F&R, 
“[F&R] felt is was too general and too 
unspecific. It’s format in detail was the 
same as budgets we’ve submitted in the 
past two or three years and those didn’t 
have any problems,” said Steve 
Auterman, WRCT’s General Manager.
Auterman said WRCT is a non-com- 
mercial station and relies heavily on the 
Activities Fee allocation. Auterman said 
F&R went through their budget item by
item and asked several questions. “It 
caught us off guard,” he said.
WRCT formed a group of its staff mem­
bers to review everything the station 
had and looked into what it was spend­
ing money on. They made a comprehen­
sive list and began to track down real 
numbers. They came up with a budget of 
$70,000 which is what Auterman said 
would get the station up to 100 percent. 
“We realized we couldn’t ask the stu­
dents to support that,” he said.
Senate proposed a $34,000 budget for 
WRCT. The station went back and re­
vised their list and came up with roughly 
$47,000. They met with Atkinson and 
Gosden the Thursday prior to the Sen­
ate meeting to propose 
their new numbers and 
Auterman said, “They 
were a lot happier.” 
Auterman said that 
Atkinson took the pro­
posal home over the Eas­
ter holiday and on Mon­
day afternoon it reached 
Auterman.
WRCT’s budget did not 
go through F&R, instead, 
Atkinson proposed an amendment to 
cut the budget again to $45,556, and 
Senate approved the amendment.
Auterman said, “Our attitude is, we 
can survive with this and begin to make 
repairs and improvements to get us back 
to 100 percent. It’s a first step.” Auterman 
said WRCT may have to ask for a Special 
Allocation next year, but “the numbers 
overall were pretty much right on tar­
get.” WRCT still has to pay back a loan 
from Senate that they took out in 1993 
at the beginning of their power upgrade. 
The station must pay Senate $5,000 
each year for the next five years.
All three organizations have had their 
budgets finalized and are prepared for 
the next fiscal year, despite substanstial 
reductions in their spending. The Stu­
dent Union will continue to search for a 
new contract with a printer. The new 
Senate, with President Gina Schyler, 
will meet on May 2.

Student Affairs to restructure
By MAX CHITTISTER
Tartan Assistant News Editor
Student Affairs will undergo a 
restructuring next year to pro­
vide better aid for students at 
CMU.
Under the new system, the di­
rector of Residence Life, Tim Fos­
ter, will have two assistant direc­
tors of Residence Life who will 
report directly to him.
John Hannon, a current coordi­
nator of Residence Life, will move 
into the position of assistant di­
rector of Residential Program­
ming. Under him, there will be 
five coordinators of Residence 
Life, each of whom coordinates a 
separate “small area.” These ar- 
are _______________
Dean Anne Shields will have 
three coordinators of Student De­
velopment. These positions have 
not been filled yet. One of the 
coordinators will work with CIT, 
MCS, and CS, another will work 
with H&SS, CFA, and IM, and 
the third will work with graduate 
students.
Hughes said, “I think moving 
most of what I currently do (lead­
ership, personal development) as 
well as other key areas ... makes 
a great deal of sense. We can 
access those students living on 
campus more readily with this 
plan; in addition, since we’ve con­
ceptualized many of the efforts in 
areas other than Residence Life, 
we will still be able to serve stu-
Morewood, 
the Hill,
Apartments,
Suiteside, 
and Greek 
Affairs. The 
positions for 
Morewood, 
the Hill, and 
Apartments 
have yet to be 
filled. Coor- 
dinator of
Residence Life Cameo Abifarin 
will be Suiteside, while Greek 
advisor Janine Coppola will 
handle Greek Affairs.
The assistant director of Devel­
opmental Programming will be 
Allison Riley. There are four Co­
ordinators of Residence Life in 
her department. Kimberly 
DiDionato will work in First Year 
Programs, and Kevin Hughes will 
move from Student Affairs in or­
der to work on Leadership and 
Personnel Development.
The other two positions, which 
are Scholarship and Family Pro­
grams and Administrative Ser­
vices, are not filled yet.
These positions are full-time 
jobs; Foster estimated that there 
are about four to five hundred 
students who work part-time for 
Residence Life. These positions 
include course assistants, resi­
dent assistants, desk managers, 
desk attendants, Orientation 
counselors, and Pre-College coun­
selors.
In Student Affairs, Associate
“The changes are designed to en­
sure that there is a closer connec­
tion between students and both Stu­
dent Affairs and Residence Life. ”
— Michael Murphy, 
dean of Student Affairs
dents who choose not to live in 
University housing. In this way I 
believe we will not only be able to 
meet the needs of more students 
but also more closely work on 
building a sense of community on 
campus.” Dean of Student Affairs 
Michael Murphy said, “In gen­
eral, the changes are designed to 
ensure that there is a closer con­
nection between individual stu­
dents and members of both the 
Student Affairs office and Resi­
dence Life office staffs. I think 
these staff members have done 
an outstanding job in strength­
ening services, and the building 
of close relationships with stu­
dents has been a big part of that. 
Still, there are students who don’t 
always know where to turn for 
help, or who don’t have the trust­
ing relationship with a staff advi­
sor as a foundation on which to 
build. Specifically, we are enthu­
siastic about enhancing the con­
tinuity of student advising sup­
port throughout a student’s total 
years here. This will be accom­
plished by providing increased 
support in Residence Life, as has 
already been begun with the ad­
vent of the student Community 
Advisor position and the creation 
of a full-time live-in fraternity 
and sorority advisor.”
Foster pointed out that, in ad­
dition to the new positions to be 
filled, there will be six liaisons, 
one to each undergraduate col­
lege. They will be there to “point 
students in the right direction,” 
Foster said.
The liaisons will be Murphy, 
Shields, Foster, Hannon, Riley, 
and Anne Witchner. The liaisons 
will be able to tell students the 
proper people to go to with ques­
tions or problems. This is part of 
__________ a funneling pro­
cess, which will 
guide specific 
groups of stu­
dents to certain 
people.
Shields feels 
that one of the 
greatest benefits 
of the new sys­
tem is “visibility 
of resources.” She 
———- said that in the 
past, students 
could go to Student Affairs, but 
there were no specific resources 
of which the students could make 
use. Under the new structure, 
students will be able to do this.
Foster said that the new struc­
ture is a “tremendously positive 
thing.” He feels that the new 
“small team” concept will bring 
about a “more active atmosphere” 
and have a “tangible impact on 
the quality of student life.” 
Hughes feels much the same 
way. “I’m excited about the move 
and the opportunities that will be 
available for students next year.
... The important tiling for all of 
us to keep in mind is that any of 
the staff in the entire division, no 
matter where they are located or 
what topic area they work in, will 
continue to be available informal 
and informal roles for students.... 
Because people or programs 
switch offices doesn’t mean that 
those same people or programs 
are no longer available to folks. 
They are simply being coordi­
nated out of a different area.”

FORUM
Carnegie Mellon University24 Aprii 1995Senate ‘rule-bending’ 
invalidates authority
What is the function of Stu­
dent Senate? After the contro­
versy surrounding last 
Tuesday’s Senate meeting, this 
is a question the student body 
should be asking itself. A Sen­
ate is usually described as a 
body of elected representatives 
who pass legislation based on 
the preferences of their constitu­
ents.
Here at CMU, however, Sen­
ate does not fulfill this function; 
instead it largely operates as an 
allocater of student group funds. 
The core of this responsibility 
occurs in the budget process 
whereby Senate and the Fund­
ing and Recognition Committee 
(F&R) approve or modify the 
proposed budgets of recognized 
student groups. This process was 
severely flawed this year—Sen­
ate violated several of their by­
laws surrounding the budget 
process, yet managed to pass 
their budget package. Such po­
litical maneuvers are an abuse 
of Senate’s financial power; they 
should not be voting on budgets 
through a faulty process. This 
shoddy legislation threatened 
the well-being of several stu­
dent organizations and calls 
Senate’s performance into ques­
tion.
Senate was supposed to publi­
cize the budget hearings in both 
The Student Union and The Tar­
tan. No articles or advertise­
ments were submitted to either 
publication which violated 
Senate’s bylaws. However, Sen­
ate ruled that because the F&R 
Chair sent email to the leaders 
of particular student groups, 
that the intentions of the by­
laws were fulfilled. But how can 
email to a handful of student 
groups ( and not all were con­
tacted) inform the entire cam­
pus community about the bud­
get process — especially when 
this email was only sent two 
days in advance? Senate is claim­
ing that email to the specific 
groups is synonymous with pub­
licizing the hearing in publica­
tions which reach over 7,000 
people. It seems the bylaws spe­
cifically mention The Tartan and 
The Union (not email) precisely
because they are made acces­
sible to a wide audience.
We are concerned that Senate 
neglected to publicize one of 
their most crucial meetings of 
the year to the campus commu­
nity at the expense of several 
student groups. When Senate 
and F&R are proposing such 
severe cuts to organizations as 
the Political Speakers Forum 
Board (PSFB), The Student 
Union, and WRCT, the student 
body must be aware of these 
cutbacks, as they will most cer­
tainly affect their daily lives at 
CMU.
On a different but related note, 
Senate suspended fiscal policy 
at the actual budget meeting 
when their bylaws state it 
should be voted on one week in 
advance. This just shows again 
the disregard Senate has for its 
own laws and its tendency to 
abuse the legislative process.
Our bottom line is that Sen­
ate needs to follow their bylaws 
and follow them consistently. It 
is slightly disturbing to be at a 
Senate meeting and hear the 
Chair say, “Okay, we have to 
bend the rules on this one...” By 
overriding their bylaws, Sen­
ate sends a clear message to its 
constituents that they have 
little regard for their own gov­
erning principles. Furthermore, 
Senate needs to embrace neu­
trality when deciding the bud­
gets of certain student groups.
While Senators are students 
and are likely to have a friendly 
relationship with certain stu­
dent groups, Senate has a re­
sponsibility to make informed, 
unbiased decisions. The budget 
process is a crucial process and 
should not be nullified by un­
professional favoritism. More­
over, Senate needs to improve 
their public relations on cam­
pus. A 6.5 percent voter turn­
out at the last election implies 
that students aren’t aware or 
concerned with the actions of 
Student Senate. Senate needs 
to improve communications be­
tween itself and its constitu­
ents so it may fulfill the repre­
sentative function it was estab­
lished to serve.
‘UC’ lacks character 
of traditional ‘Skibo’
The final beam of the new Stu­
dent Center was installed ear­
lier this week — evidence that 
the builders are right on sched­
ule with the project. Although 
the actual construction of the 
Center is very encouraging, we 
are disappointed that the ad­
ministration is considering nam­
ing the building “The Univer­
sity Center” instead of “Skibo.”
This claim may sound trite, 
but we put much stock in the 
phrase, “there’s a lot in a name.” 
Skibo is a name that is almost 
synonymous with tradition at 
CMU. This is saying a lot, since 
our school has almost no claims 
to tradition.
Skibo, also the name of 
Carnegie’s Scottish castle, has 
been around for a long time at 
CMU: it was first the name of a 
student-run inn. Next, it was
Letters to the Editor

Student Center Room 101
the name of the student union 
that used to exist where Hunt is 
now located. Finally, Skibo was 
the name of the student union 
that was demolished last year 
to make room for the new, spa­
cious, and elaborate University 
Center (could you think of a 
more impersonal name if you 
tried?). Skibo has meant some­
thing to generations of CMU 
graduates—why sever this his­
tory unnecessarily?
The University does plan to 
name the building eventually. 
Anyone donating $20 million is 
virtually guaranteed having the 
Center named after them. To 
name the Center after a person 
is a boring practice. By naming 
the building Skibo we will con­
tinue a tradition while also keep­
ing capitalistic nomenclatures 
off of our academic buildings.
Editor:
I am writing in re­
sponse to the editorial,
“Excessive competition L©tt6F tO 
detracts from Carni- .« PrflStnr
val,” and to correct mis- tUllOi
information regarding 
Alpha Epsilon Pi’s booth so people can 
know what really happened.
First, regarding misinformation. The 
booth didn’t collapse or suffer any struc­
tural failure; rather, it toppled because 
of a balance problem when trying to put 
the roof on. This is clear because none of 
the understructure broke to cause the 
fall. By the way, our booth had only one 
staircase, and our booth chair’s name 
was Jeffrey Byrne.
In your editorial, organizations are 
chastised for not running to our aid 
when our booth “collapsed.” While the 
level of competition surrounding Carni­
val is very high, organizations were still 
very helpful. I know that most, if not all, 
organizations that were on Midway at 
the time of the accident did, in fact, stop 
their work to make sure my brothers 
were okay. Only after that did they go to 
work. We appreciate their help.
Many organizations helped us after 
the fact as well. I sincerely thank all of 
the organizations for their help and sup­
port, including (but not limited to), Delta 
Delta Delta, Delta Upsilon, Alpha Phi 
Omega (who even went to a rules com­
mittee meeting to see if their further 
help would be acceptable), Sigma Nu, 
SDC, KGB, and Physical Plant and Car­
nival Committee, which both did every­
thing they could to allow us to get our 
booth up and running.
As you can see, the error of your 
thoughts on the competitive atmosphere 
is false as a whole, particularly.regard- 
ing our accident. If we were all that 
competitive, the loaning of tools and 
ladders, the extra hand to hold a wall, 
and the moral support would not have 
existed on Midway.
The same goes for the buggy course. 
Without organizations working together, 
race day would never happen. The course 
would be a wreck, and crowd control 
would be impossible. The crowd may 
cheer when someone else crashes, but 
they certainly hope that the driver wasn’t 
hurt. They may laugh at the pusher who 
does a face-plant on Hill #2, but at the 
same time, they respect.the speed and 
teamwork it takes to break a course 
record. While we all thrive on the com­
petitive spirit of Carnival, other more 
important things still come first.

This letter is in re­
sponse to the “Exces­
sive Competition” edi- L6tt6T tO 
torial which appeared CHitnr
in the April 10 Tartan. I UIC tu,lur 
want to specifically address the remarks
concerning the collapse of the Alpha 
Epsilon Pi booth. The authors stated 
that other student organizations failed 
to aid AEPi due to intense Carnival 
rivalry. This is not a fair portrayal of the 
incident. The authors asked, “Did other 
organizations run to their aid?” The an­
swer is no, not because of excessive com­
petition but because we were told by 
security to wait for the more experi­
enced and trained emergency personnel 
to arrive. The authors also asked, “Did 
they help them rebuild?” The answer 
once again is no, not because of some 
mean-spirited rivalry but because doing 
so would have disqualified AEPi from 
the competition according to the Carni­
val bylaws (A14 & E3). The authors also 
stated that “each organization was so 
caught up in their booth ... the sound of 
hammering did not stop.” Seeing that 
the other organizations could not help 
AEPi, I’m glad that they continued work­
ing rather than forming a mob around 
the collapse site to gawk and hamper 
emergency services.

Letter to

Editor:
I recently read with 
interest Allie King’s 
article on the Contract 
with America. The 
Contract, while hotly 
debated in other insti­
tutions of higher learning, has remained 
largely undiscussed by members of the 
CMU community. King’s article, al­
though misplaced on page 3 of the “Liv­
ing” section, points out implications the 
Contract on America might have. In 
other papers, Newt Gingrich was quoted 
to say Pell Grants are “insults” to stu­
dents by insinuating that we are too lazy 
to pay for our college education (Boston 
Globe, 2/3/94, p.21). Some, if not all, of 
the Contract is very disturbing. Where 
are our opinions on this matter? If CMU 
is ever to become a university that is 
regarded as first-tier, its members must 
have a voice and promote dialogue on 
issues that will undoubtedly affect all of 
higher learning. CMU administrators, 
faculty, staff, and students should real­
ize the potential threats involved. Imag­
ine the scene five years from now: the 
8.5" by 11" News reports that under 
extreme budget cuts, CMU eliminates 
financial need-based acceptance proce­
dures altogether.
Whatever the scenario, for better or 
for worse, the more important issue is 
one of social responsibility. Shall we just 
go along with the politicians and the 
pundits, or will we take an active role in 
our futures? The former is the behavior 
of a cow, unwittingly waiting for the 
slaughterhouse. King’s article men­
tioned two sources on the Internet re­
garding activity surrounding the Con­
tract. It should be noted that the Univer­
sity Conversion Project/Center for Cam­
pus Organizing (UCP/CCO, not UPC) 
has been a leader in researching the 
Contract and promoting action, as well 
as providing information. As a member
of the Advisory Board, I would invite the 
campus to browse my web page, <http:/ 
/www.contrib.andrew.cmu.edU/usr/ti08/ 
UCPJump_page.html>. (Cut and paste 
from my .plan file.) From there, you will 
find the actual text of the Contract, and 
the National Call to Action that ] 
passed. It turns out that more than 100 
campuses held protests, rallies, vigils, 
and teach-ins, many in numbers of 100- 
600 people. Princeton had a 500-person 
rally. Columbia, Yale, Cornell, Emory, 
U. of Michigan, as well as nearby Indi­
ana U. of Pennsylvania had demonstra­
tions of their own. CMU has yet to reveal 
opinions on the matter. There is z 
much activity within the city; the Citi­
zens Budget Campaign is one example. 
Politicians plan to take a wrecking ball 
to the ivory tower. We have no choice but 
to leave and look outside.
I would like to end with this quote 
from the April edition of UCP’s newslet­
ter, Study War No More.
“While the Contract With America will 
have real-life consequences for millions 
of families, the true goal of the Contract 
is not legislative, but cultural and social. 
The point is not to pass enforceable laws, 
but to create fear and anxiety among 
immigrants, women, African Americans, 
working people, and gays and lesbians. 
This process is called scapegoating, and 
it is, according to many political scien­
tists, a prerequisite for fascism.”

I was very disap­
pointed with your cov­
erage of the 1995 
Sweepstakes. Instead 
of going over the high­
lights, interviewingthe 
winners, interviewing the second place 
team, and just plain getting the inside 
scoop, the coverage went over each indi­
vidual heat and gave wrong informa­
tion. It barely even talked about the: 
winners or how exciting the final mo­
ment was as Spirit crossed the finish 
line. The entire article was very “mat­
ter-of-fact” and never discussed emo­
tion, which was a big part of the races. 
The women’s coverage was even worse. 
There was very little mention of exactly 
how close PiKA and Spirit were as they 
went around the chute. There was no 
mention of how the buggies actually 
touched. Plus, the women’s article was 
much shorter in comparison to the men s 
races. Each should be given equal time. 
Next year I would like to see an article 
like one that Sports Illustrated would 
write about the Super Bowl or the NCAA 
Final Four. It should be an article that 
has life. Thank you very much.

Skewed male/female ratio effects relations
Michelle Hall
I didn’t know anything about 
the male to female ratio before I 
came to CMU. I considered ap­
plying to an all-female school but 
ided to attend a co-ed school 
because I thought that it would 
be more like the real world. You 
can imagine my surprise when I 
discovered during orientation 
that- only about a third of my 
class was female. At first I was 
pleasantly overwhelmed by the 
attention I received from guys 
around campus. During orienta­
tion I heard over and over that 
fraternity rush parties were open 
to freshmen guys and all women. 
But at the time, I had no clear 
conception of how different the
experience of being a woman here 
would be from my experience at 
another university.
After the initial novelty of a 
new place wore off, I began to 
think a little more about my sta­
tus as a female at CMU. At first it 
didn’t strike me as strange that 
all of my close friends were guys. 
It was an interesting change from 
high school where all of my best 
friends had been women. But I 
got tired of hearing all the guys I 
knew complain about how few 
women there are here. I noticed 
how my male friends treated me 
as the be-all end-all authority on 
the female race. I couldn’t make 
them understand that I didn’t 
know the answer to their ques­
tions.
I consoled myself with long 
phone calls to my best friends 
from high school and my mother, 
and told myself that getting the 
male perspective on things was
something valuable. After my 
first year here I found myself 
getting closer to various women 
who workedwith me at the Office 
of Admission. But whenever I 
needed advice or a shoulder to cry 
on, I still went to my guy friends.
Being a woman at CMU has 
been an unusual experience. I 
won’t downplay the significance 
of having close male friends — I 
can never be comfortable bash­
ing men and the stereotypes about 
men that I harbored no longer 
exist. However, I can’t say that 
sometimes the lack of a female 
connection doesn’t get frustrat­
ing. I like to think that because 
there are so few women here, 
women at CMU have a better- 
developed, more precise concep­
tion of themselves as women. It 
could be that being a member of 
this particular minority group 
produces stronger women with 
more acute self-awareness.
On the other hand, women here 
are sometimes treated as a val­
ued commodity. Stereotypes and 
assumptions about women exist 
here, just as they do everywhere 
else.
I’ve never really felt discrimi­
nated against because I’m a 
woman, except in the sense that 
the men I know will talk about 
the control women have over men 
here, because there are so few of 
us. I’ve felt uncomfortable at 
times when I realize how desen­
sitized I’ve become to typical 
male talk about women. I get 
irritated by my friends’ assump­
tion that I will not be offended by 
the things they say. These are 
the things that make me feel like 
the token female of a particular 
group.
More than anything else, when 
I think about being a woman at 
CMU, I have questions. How can 
CMU attract more women? Why
do the men here use the lack of 
females as an excuse to complain 
about being here? Is CMU more 
like the real world than attend­
ing an all-female school? I think 
more outreach to female prospec­
tive students is imperative. Per­
haps a panel at Sleeping Bag 
Weekends specifically for women 
would help. Overnight or sum­
mer programs for women could 
possibly draw more female appli­
cants, especially women inter­
ested in science and engineering. 
Women here could be a real driv­
ing force, if only there were more 
of them. I do not regret my deci­
sion to attend CMU, but I cringe 
when I think that some other 
freshman girl will have to listen 
to her parents and friends say, 
“Don’t you have any female 
friends?”

Republicans push ‘nauseatingly’ ironic legislation
Patrick Hunt
For the past 25 years, the steps taken 
regarding the protection of our environment 
have improved the conditions of our country 
and the Earth. Although many more steps 
need to be taken, we have become conscious 
of the delicate relationship we have with our 
planet, and many environmental issues have 
been given adequate attention. Although 
some politicians still refuse to accept envi­
ronmental issues as important, it seemed to 
me that such reluctance was decreasing. 
This Earth Day, the 25th time we celebrate 
our planet, embodies the manifestation of 
these improvements. Unfortunately, it may 
also mark their end.
Isn’t it almost nauseatingly ironic that as 
we celebrate our Earth for the 25th time, our 
Congress and Senate are pushing legislation 
that will distroy everything that Earth Day 
stands for? Doesn’t it appear to be almost a 
deliberate act on their part that they sprung 
these plans on us at a time of year that is
filled with so much meaning? The nar­
row-minded Republicans on Capitol Hill 
disgust me once again, and this time the 
repercussions of their actions will affect 
not only the citizens of America, but also 
the citizens of the entire planet.
Our happy, and always cheerful, Re­
publicans in Washington recently an­
nounced that they plan to make many 
changes to our current environmental 
legislation. None of these changes make 
an ounce of sense. One of their plans 
involves pesticides known to contain car­
cinogens. Even though these pesticides 
wreak havoc on every species inhabiting 
the Earth, our politicians feel that the 
detriments of such pesticides have been 
blown out of proportion, and with this 
sentiment in mind, they propose to make 
the rules governing their use less strin­
gent. One idea involved any pesticide 
that the EPA cannot test within 45 days. 
Since these chemicals are so important, 
and since 45 days is such a longtime, they 
are proposing that the pesticides should 
be able to be used until they can be 
properly tested. One Republican was more 
specific about the use of pesticides; he 
claimed that DDT is a beneficial sub­
stance. I am wondering, does he smoke
it? How else can he consider a chemical 
tliat has caused innumerable damages 
to our environment a beneficial sub­
stance?
Several other of their proposed 
changes to our legislation: developing 
wetland areas, discontinuing the addi­
tions of further animals to the list of 
endangered species, and passing laws 
that make it easier to pollute. These 
changes are all for industry. Burgeon­
ing industry will be given an injection 
that will allow them to rise fast and 
easily. Unfortunately, this injection is 
going to act like a steroid. At first, rap­
idly desirable results will be immedi­
ately visible, while in the long run will 
hold nothing but catastrophic problems.
We can, however, act against these 
narrow-minded politicians. They can 
propose these horrific changes to im­
portant legislation because the lobby­
ing groups for industry are currently 
more powerful and organized than the 
environmental groups. This situation 
has to change. Industry is just out to 
make a fast buck, which will ultimately 
come at our expense. They must come to 
realize that our link to the environment 
depends on them. They must conduct
their business in ways that will not harm 
our environment. Industrial concerns can 
never be more important than preserving 
the environment.
We have the capacity to influence the 
industrial decision making process. The 
University of Pittsburgh’s withdrawal 
from the harmful development of Mount 
Graham is the most recent, local demon­
stration of our ability to act. They ulti­
mately chose not to participate with the 
group who planned to destroy the last 
habitat of several endangered species in 
order to place a telescope on Mount Gra­
ham. When we come together, our voices 
are heard. It is fundamental to our future 
to keep that in mind.
If these congressional proposals become 
law, their ramifications will be appar­
ent after the people responsible for the 
have passed on. At that time, we will 
inherit the damage that our predecessors 
left for us. We will then have to work that 
much harder to preserve the world for our 
children and grandchildren. We will have 
to bear the consequences of the current 
proposals, not the people responsible for 
them. Remember that.

Maxed-out students impact low student satisfaction
The Editor’s Notebook presents 
the individual opinon of the au­
thor only, not necessarily the opin­
ions of the Tartan of the Editorial 
Board.
Student satisfaction seems to 
be the topic of interest among 
administrators, students and fac­
ulty and staff. It seems that ev­
eryone has the time to complain 
and gripe about the flaws of 
Carnegie Mellon, but very few 
are willing to invest the time and 
energy to, to use an abused 
phrase, “to make a difference.”
None of these points are new 
ones; I myself am sick of being 
told that the student body at CMU
is characteristically apathetic, 
especially when I see such laud­
able programs as the University 
Outreach, Tutoring programs, 
and other such organizations tak­
ing an active role in improving 
society. With this in mind, I am 
forced to wonder why, aside from 
the typical, reasons, students just 
don’t seem to be happy with the 
life Carnegie Mellon has offered 
them.
One source of these frustrations 
is the approach to academics 
taken at CMU. Many current stu­
dents come here for higher edu­
cation because they are attracted. 
to the “no bullshit” attitude that 
is very often a component of the 
CMU-style of doing things: these 
are your requirements, these are 
your deadlines, there are no ex­
cuses.
While the very strong-willed 
may embrace these attitudes, 
most can keep up with the high
demands associated with this sort 
of educational philosophy for only 
so long. It is after that “breaking 
point” that students become de­
pressed, unproductive, and ter­
minally unhappy.
Another source of this dissatis­
faction may be an inability to 
dedicate the time and energy to 
pure learning. Most degree pro­
grams require that a student take 
five, nine-unit courses per semes­
ter in order to graduate in the 
generally accepted four years. 
Now I am not suggesting a com­
plete overhaul of every academic 
program on campus, but imagine 
the possibilities associated with 
having only four classes per se­
mester. Consider the average stu­
dent: in any given week, he may 
have three to four problem sets, 
at least one exam, and probably a 
paper or group project looming 
sometime in the near future. Now 
the enterprising individual can
certainly time-manage her way 
through all this, but add one stu­
dent activity - perhaps a meet­
ing or two - and the constraints 
soon become too tight. Throw in a 
work-study job, and you have one 
maxed-out and soon-to-be unpro­
ductive student.
The true loss of this situation is 
the blow that pure learningtakes. 
Problem sets have become, for 
many, a routine task; an exercise 
in looking up examples and work­
ing only to complete the assign­
ment by morning. Seldom can a 
student take the time to explore 
the true intentions of problem 
sets - to provide an in-depth ap­
proach to the subject matter in 
an attempt to teach it. When the 
main goal of the student is to 
simply complete the task in X 
amount of time, little learning 
can actually take place. If stu­
dents had one less set of 
requirements, i.e., one less class,
perhaps they could take the time 
to learn what they are reading.
Again, I use the scenario of 
requiring one less class per se­
mester as an example only. How­
ever, if requirements were to be 
decreased somewhat, students 
would have more time to learn, 
feel, and grow; three components 
of college life that seem to be 
lacking at Carnegie Mellon. Per­
haps if requirements were re­
duced in some way, students could 
take the personal risk of getting 
involved in student activities, and 
could question and try to change 
what bothers them about CMU, 
instead of simply complaining and 
swearing they will never return 
after graduation. Is that the atti­
tude we want our own alumni to 
have? I don’t think so.

Volume 89, Issue 23 The Tartan, Carnegie Mellon University, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 24 April 1995
will feature many surprisesBA playoffs
Below the Rim
by Darren Chiappetta
With the NBA playoffs set to 
!krt this week, there is much 
Peculation about what team will 
it all this season. To every- 
'ne wondering about who to put 
toney on, stop and read this be- 
0re calling your neighborhood 
!o°kie. I know who’s going to win 
^d how they’re going to do it. No 
foesswork involved here. You can 
f°w your friends with your in­
credible basketball knowledge 
and take home lots of cash if you 
follow these playoff prescriptions. 
So, without further delay, let’s 
get to it — I humbly present to 
you, my loyal readers, the first 
annual Below the Rim post-sea- 
son predictions.
FIRST ROUND 
Eastern Conference: No sur­
prises here, as the seeds number 
one through four advance. Or­
lando beats Boston in three 
games, despite the fact that Larry 
Bird, John Havlicek, and Bill 
Russell are in the starting lineup 
for Game Three. The Celtics’ pub­
lic relations department issues 
this statement to the media prior 
to the final game played in Bos­
ton Gardens: “We’re not going to 
beat Orlando anyway, and be­
sides, who would you rather see 
play, David Wesley or Hondo?” 
Indiana beats Atlanta, New 
York defeats Cleveland, and 
Charlotte is stretched to five 
games before ending Michael 
Jordan’s run to a fourth NBA 
title. Jordan wins Game Four 
with a 24-foot jump shot over 
Craig Ehlo (traded to Charlotte 
by Atlanta at the start of the 
playoffs) with Scottie Pippen sit­
ting on the bench. Pippen was 
upset the play was drawn up for 
Jordan, and after the game, he 
refuses to speak to reporters, say­
ing only, “I’ll have something spe­
cial for Game Five.”
With the Hornets up by one 
late in the fifth game, Jordan 
passes to Pippen, who removes

Suicide Squeeze
by Anuj Gupta
Once known as the American 
League ‘best,’ the American 
League West is now the laughing 
stock of the junior circuit. Though 
the National League West Cham­
pion Los Angeles Dodgers fin­
ished with a winning record last 
year, as opposed to the A.L. West 
Champion Rangers, the National 
League West has also become the 
weakest division in the N.L. Due 
to the mass waves of free agent 
movements, things may change 
for the better in 1995 as the Rang­
ers and Dodgers are once again 
primed to win ‘real’ division titles. 
Here’s a look, starting with the 
American League:
California Angels: Well, if 
they can manage to carry a lead 
into the eighth or ninth inning, 
the Angels will come out with a 
win more often than not. After 
signing the all-time saves leader, 
Lee Smith, and the all time head­
aches leader, Mitch Williams, the 
Angels have done a heck of a job 
of rebuilding a decimated bullpen. 
The addition of these veterans 
will also give hard-throwing 
youngster Troy Percival adequate 
time to harness his fastball. Now 
the only problem is ... getting a 
lead for the ’pen to preserve. This 
Angels team is going nowhere, 
and the highlight of the year may 
be the release of Angels in the 
Outfield on video cassette. Youth 
and talent are there with names
such as Jim Edmonds, Garrett 
Anderson, Tim Salmon, Eduardo 
Perez, and J.T. Snow, taking the 
field. But for now, they are too 
young, and though veterans Mark 
Langston, Chuck Finley, and 
newly-acquired Tony Phillips 
helps, it won’t be enough. To­
wards the end of the season they 
will play the role of the spoiler. 
Predicted finish: Fourth place.
Oakland Athletics: Are these 
the 1995 A’s or the World Cham­
pion 1989 A’s? For whatever rea­
son, GM Sandy Alderson has de­
cided to hold a reunion of the 
great A’s teams of the late 1980s 
by bringing back the likes of Greg 
Cadaret, Rick Honeycutt, Dave 
Stewart, and Rickey Henderson 
from past years. The only prob­
lem is that it is six years later,. 
and these players are well past 
their primes. That is not to say

in UAA Championships
Men take third; women place fourth
By STEVEN BURNS
Tartan Staffwriter
The UAA Track and Field 
Championships were held 
this past weekend at the 
University of Chicago.
Carnegie Mellon sent its 
men’s and women’s track 
teams to participate.
The University of Wash- 
ington-St. Louis took both 
the men’s and the women’s 
crowns, but the Tartan men 
had a very strong showing 
as they took third place.
The women’s team also per­
formed well as they took 
fourth place in the eight 
team field.
The men’s team was lead 
by its usual good showing 
in the field events. The jav­
elin was the team’s strongest event as the Tartans 
took the top two places. Sophomore Jody Rogish 
finished first with a throw of 54.82 meters which 
was five meters further than the second place 
finisher, junior Shigehiro Kanaya who threw for a 
distance of 49.62 meters.
This performance was followed up by a third and 
fifth place in the shot put. Senior Jason Grusky 
took third with a throw of 14.75 meters. Junior 
Demetrius Carrothers took fifth with a throw of 
13.43 meters.
The high jump was another highlight for the 
team as freshman Peter Hunt and freshman George 
Matcuk each jumped to a height of 1.89 meters to 
take fourth and fifth respectively.
Multiple third place finishes also helped the team. 
Senior Phil Beck vaulted to a height of 4.22 meters 
in the Pole Vault to take third. Junior E.J. Tsangaris 
took third in the discus with a
place finisher.
She then followed up this perfor­
mance with a fifth place finish in 
the discus. She threw the disc a 
distance of 33.10 meters. The 
Tartan’s sophomore Leslie Brown 
took fourth in the same event with 
a throw of 36.36 meters.
Brown took second in the ham­
mer throw with a throw of 35.92 
meters to continue the hot streak 
for the Tartans.
The Tartans then had a series of 
fourth, fifth, and sixth place fin­
ishes. Freshman Jessica Connolly 
took fourth in the triple jump as 
she leapt 10.22 meters. Freshman 
Vicki White took fifth in the shot 
put with a throw of 9.57 meters. 
Sophomore SarahPacochafinished 
out the scoring in the field events 
with a jump of 1.44 meters that 
earned her sixth place in the high 
jump.
Bebee shined on the track for the Tartans. She 
won the 100-meter dash with an NCAA qualifying 
time of 12.54 seconds. She followed this up by 
taking third place as a member of the 1600-meter 
relay team.
Sophomore Becky Buchheit also ran well for the 
Tartans as she finished second in the 5000-meters. 
She crossed the line in 18:45.31.
To finish out the scoring on the track the Tartans 
had a number of fifth and sixth place finishes. 
Freshman Melissa Lott and Buchheit finished fifth 
and sixth respectively in the 3000-meters. Lott 
came across the line in 10:56.98 while Buchheit 
finished in 11:06.68. The 400-meter relay team 
took fifth place with a time of 52.17 seconds. Fi­
nally, junior Missy Baustert finished sixth in the 
1500-meters with a time of 4:57.04.

Men’s soccer hosts tournament
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Copy Manager
The Carnegie Mellon men’s soccer coach Nick 
Gaudioso and a number of players from his var­
sity team played the last event of the spring club 
season Friday night, playing a round-robin exhi­
bition tournament of 30-minute games against 
Geneva College and two Canadian select teams 
made Up of 13th-graders (the Canadian schools 
have 13 grades).
“We’re just trying to get a look at some younger 
kids,” Gaudioso said. “This is good [experience] for 
the kids who didn’t play much [in the fall].”
He got a chance to 
play some of his “older 
kids” too, as the long 
spring season wore 
down the team.
Seniors like Pat 
Lucignani, Vince 
Russell, and Alex 
Amezquita all played, 
and even assistant 
coach John Stivoric ( a 
former CMU player) 
got some game action 
and came close to scor­
ing twice on headers.
Among the young­
sters who got some 
game action was
mores Bob Schultz and Taimoor Labib, and 
junior Dan Beyer.
While the quality of play was not as high as 
the regular varsity competition, Gaudioso said 
he was watching his team’s performance care­
fully. “It’s spring. We knew what to expect [in 
terms of play]. We’re just looking for certain 
things out there.”
One player who was trying to get back into 
the swing of things was senior Jeff McJunkin, 
who missed the bulk of last season as a medical 
redshirt after suffering a leg injury. “He’s fine,” 
Gaudioso said. “His injury's all [healed].” 
Although the team has been doing an off­
season program featur­
ing weight training, 
Gaudioso said the spring 
season provided good 
game action. He had one 
other subject on his 
mind: recruiting.
“The next.two weeks 
are important,” he said, 
because that is the time 
for recruits to decide 
where to go.
The biggest question 
for next season is 
goaltending. Alexander 
and junior John Moran 
have virtually no game 
experience. Gaudioso

throw of44.82 meters. Also, sopho­
more Doug Harrell finished third 
in the triple jump as he leapt a 
distance of 13.46 meters.
Rounding out the field events 
was a fourth place finish in the 
long jump by Harrell who leapt 
6.36 meters.
The men also did well on the 
track. Freshman Jeffrey Jones 
and junior Zack Conly finish third 
and fourth respectively in the 110- 
meter hurdles. Jones came across 
the line in 15.32 and was followed 
by Conly in 15.52.
Sophomore Buck Neel took fifth 
in the 100-meter dash with a time 
of 11.37 seconds. Also, sophomore 
Ron Polcowich took sixth in the 
3000-meter steeplechase with a 
time of 10:27.52.
The relay teams finished off the 
scoring for Carnegie Mellon. The 
400-meter relay took fifth with a 
time of 44.53. The 1600-meter 
relay finished fourth with a time 
3:30.01.
The women had two first and 
two second place finishes. They 
were led by outstanding perfor­
mances by sophomores Penny 
Summerville and Vonquitra 
Bebee.
Summerville won the javelin 
competition. She hurled the jav­

of 40.06 meters, a distance of 6.2

Both the men’s and women’s tennis teams came 
¡¡lit of the UAA Championships with ties. The 
tien’s team tied with Brandeis University for fifth 
place while the women’s team tied with Case 
Western for seventh place. According to John 
¿renberg, Emory’s sports information director, 
the bad weather rained 
0ut the consolation 
¡aatches. “The teams 
weren’t really con­
cerned with making up 
the matches because 
they all had plane res­
ervations. If we had 
saited for the weather 
to get better we may 
have been here till two 
in the morning.”
The men’s team came 
into the tournament 
seeded at number four 
and with high hopes of 
doing well. Coach Pete 
Moss said that the all 
of the players on the 
team were important to 
the overall success of the season. “There are no key 
players on the team.” Number two seed freshman 
Navroze Marshall said, “Everyone’s confident of 
teating them [first round opponent Rochester]. 
We are looking and feel that we have nothing to 
lose.” The men’s first round opponent, Rochester 
was a formidable opponent. Using tournament 
format with all six singles each worth one point 
and the three combined doubles worth one point, 
CMU lost to Rochester 6—1. Although the score 
seemed like a one-sided match — most of the 
matches were close. Marshall won his match in 
straight sets while number one seed Jim Freese 
and number five seed senior Bill Mathey lost their 
matches in straight sets. Number three seed grad 
student John Muza, number four seed senior Mike
Macedonia, and number six seed senior Dan 
Bilco all lost close three-set matches. The doubles 
team of Muza/Mathey won their match but 
Freese/Marshall and Macedonia/Bilco lost theirs.
In the consolation semi-finals the men’s team 
was matched up with Case Western, a team they 
had already beaten earlier in the regular season. 
Freese lost his match but Marshall, Muza, and 
Orife all won their matches. Good play by the 
doubles team clinched the match for 
CMU. The next opponent was Brandeis 
in the finals for the fifth place but be­
cause of the weather, the two teams 
were unable to play.
The women’s team struggled this year 
with a young team. Not among the top 
seeded teams, the team’s main goal was 
to improve on the season’s performance. 
Number two seed junior Namita Amin 
said, “The top teams are a lot tougher, 
so our main goal is to be among the top 
seven.” The women’s team played num­
ber two seed Brandeis University in the 
first round. Playing on a the regular 
season format of having each match 
worth one point, CMU was swept 9-0. 
The top six singles players: senior 
Stephanie Kukura, Amin, freshman 
Shuana Quill, junior Miriam Huang, 
sophomore Michele Cook, and freshman Jackie 
Autieri all lost their matches in straight sets. 
The doubles teams of Kukura/Quill, Amin/Huang 
and Autieri/Cook also lost their matches. Moss 
anticipated a struggle with the top teams by 
citing the inexperience of the team as a major 
factor in the team’s strife this season.
The next opponent was New York in the cons o- 
lation semi-finals. The team only played two 
singles matches and lost 5-0. Miriam Huang and 
Jackie Autieri both lost their matches. Although 
CMU lost all of the doubles matches, the scores 
were close and the match could have gone either 
way. The team was supposed to play Case West­
ern in the finals for seventh place but bad weather 
did not make this possible.
Jim Snyder/ Tartan Photo Editor 
Due to weather, teams were unable 
to play the tie-breaking matches.

The men’s track team put forth a great collective effort to come away 
with third place, just ahead of Rochester and Emory.

TheCMU Golf team traveled to Wheel­
ing. West Virginia, on April 5 to partici­
pate In the Speidel Invitational. They 
foished third out of nine teams. Junior 
Gfegg Lassan led the Tartans with a low 
score of 87. Other leaders were junior 
•osh Kenin and junior Rick Rothrauff 
88 apiece, and senior Brett Forejt 
»ith a 93.
The team also participated in the 
flng’s College Invitational on April 8-9, 
''here they placed 10th out of the 15 
“ams participating. Lassan again took 
°P honors, along with freshman Byung 
kng, each with a two-day total of 162. 
•assan placed 20th overall in the tour- 
!ament, and Kang came in right behind 
^ 2lst place. Junior Badruddin Hilal 
*me in 44th with a score of 172, and 
^thrauff and Kenin again contributed 
tith scores of 176 (53rd place) and 
(58th place), respectively.
Rockies, Rangers looking strong in weak divisions
BASEBALL, from page 9
that the A’s don’t have talent, for with a 
healthy Brent Gates, Mark McGwire 
and Ruben Sierra, the A’s lineup is as 
good as any body’s. The problem lies in 
the pitching staff as Ron Darling, Todd 
VanPoppel, Stewart, and the rest are 
too old or too inconsistent. Many pros­
pects are on the horizon but may not be 
ready this season. The players from the 
glory days are back, but the talent isn’t. 
Predicted finish: Second place.
Seattle Mariners: On paper, this 
team has the talent of a pennant con­
tender. On the field, this team is the 
biggest underachiever outside of the 
Philadelphia Eagles. With the likes of 
Ken Griffey Jr., Jay Buhner, Edgar 
Martinez, and Alex Rodriguez in the 
field and a staff featuring Randy 
Johnson, Chris Bosio, Dave Fleming, 
etc., one would expect this team to be the 
runaway in a weak division. Unfortu­
nately, as hard as manager Lou Pinella 
tries, the attitude on this team is too 
nonchalant, reflecting the attitude of 
uppermanagementandthe Seattle fans. 
This team has the talent to easily win 
this division. It will require everybody to 
play to their potential. In Seattle, where 
ceiling tiles fall from the sky, that may 
be asking too much. Predicted finish: 
Third place.
Texas Rangers: “Carpe Diem” — 
seize the day — should be the motto of 
the 1995 Rangers. Unfortunately, with 
the recent back injury to slugger Juan 
Gonzalez, the phrase may apply, but 
only after he returns from the disabled 
list. The.Rangers’ goal this season was 
to compile a startingrotation which could 
log enough innings and stay in enough 
games such that the offense could do the
rest of the work. With the additions of 
Kevin Gross and Bob Tewksbury to a 
rotation which already features Kenny 
Rogers and Roger Pavlik, the Rangers 
have four pitchers who can give them a 
quality start on a day in, day out basis. 
Unfortunately with the loss of Gonzalez 
in the heart of the lineup, things will 
become more 
difficult, al-
as //rangers:
slugger 
Mickey 
Tetfleton 
helps.
If they 
can stay
above water during the in­
jury, this will be the team to 
beat in the A.L. West. Predicted 
finish: First place.
And now for the National 
League:
Colorado Rockies: Strike?
“What strike,” says GM Bob 
Gebhard as he threw money 
into the free agent waters im­
mediately after the return of 
the players to catch names such 
as Larry Walker and Billy Swift.
This lineup is now a powerhouse.
With Walker, Andres Galarraga,
Dante Bichette, and Ellis Burks 
leading the way, there is no tell­
ing how many runs they can score. They 
are also strong defensively with Walt 
Weiss and Roberto Meija shoring up the 
middle infield. The major question mark 
since the inception of Denver baseball 
has been pitching, but it appears that the 
Rockies have addressed this by compiling 
a staff of ground ball pitchers and
m
strikeout artists such as Swift, Marvin 
Freeman, and David Neid. Closer Darren 
Holmes must finally realize his potential, 
but aside from that, there is more than 
enough pitching here to allow the offense 
to take care of the rest. The excitement of 
a new stadium won’t hurt either. Pre­
dicted finish: First place.
Los Angeles 
Dodgers: The
Dodgers are at­
tempting a route 
to winning 
which they 
have never tra­
versed before 
—- a youth 
movement. 
With the last three National 
League Rookies of the Year in Eric 
Karros, Mike Piazza and Raul 
Mondesi, Lasorda figures he’s on a 
hot streak, so why not keep going 
with it. With the departures of vet­
erans Brett Butler and Orel 
Hershiser, this year’s candidates for 
ROY include starting right fielder 
Todd Hollandsworth, starting left 
fielder Billy Ashley, and pitchers 
Ismael Valdez and Korean Chan Ho 
Park. Talent abounds on this team. 
The problems lies in the youth, but 
veterans Tim Wallach and Delino 
Franclne Gemperle/ DeShields will keep things to­
gether. A few questions keep this 
team from being the pre-season favorite, 
including “who will play shortstop?” and 
“will the starting rotation have any trace 
of consistency?” But if the rookies pan 
out, look for this team to be playing ball in 
October. Predicted finish: Second place.
San Diego Padres: Baseball guru 
Peter Gammons recently declared this
Tartan Co-Art Editor
team as a potential division contender. By 
participating in the largest transaction in 
the recent history of baseball, GM Randy 
Smith has mixed his young talent (such as 
Melvin Nieves, Trevor Hoffman, Andy 
Ashby, and Joey Hamilton) with youth and 
veterans from the Houston Astros (includ­
ing Andujar Cedeno, Steve Finley, and Ken 
Caminiti) to round out a team which has a 
proven veteran or rising star at every posi­
tion. One also cannot forget about veterans 
Tony Gwynn, Andy Benes, and recently 
acquired Jody Reed, who help make this 
team one of the deepest in the National 
League.
The problem again is youth, and in the 
end it will be their downfall. Make no mis­
take though, excitement is back at Jack 
Murphy Stadium, and within a year, this 
team will be a definite pennant contender. 
Predicted finish: Third place.
San Francisco Giants: Yes they have 
Barry Bonds and Matt Williams, but of­
fense is only half the game, and with the 
departures of Billy Swift and John Burkett, 
the Giants are lacking the other half — 
pitching. This team has several holes and 
as brilliant as manager Dusty Baker has 
proven himself to be over the past two 
years, there is only so much he can do. 
There is nobody to protect Bonds in the 
order and first base is still a question.
Is J.R. Phillips finally ready? With an 
overweight Mark Portugal and aging Terry 
Mulholland leading the way, the starting 
rotation is extremely weak, and though 
they have dominating closer Rod Beck still 
waiting in the ’pen, taking a lead to the 
ninth will be extremely difficult. Predicted 
finish: Fourth place.

agement major.

pic table tennis team.
Western Conference: San An­
tonio beats Denver/Sacramento 
in three games. Dennis Rodman 
is assessed six technical fouls 
and three flagrant fouls and is 
warned by the league office that 
if he is called for one more of 
either in the playoffs, he will be 
jailed indefinitely, and will not 
be allowed to participate in any 
future “I Love This Game” com­
mercials. The Worm says he has 
learned his lesson.

Charles Barkley tells reporters 
the Suns are the best team in

also says that his Sylvester is

Utah beats Houston after 
Hakeem Olajuwon trips and falls 
on his way to the series-winning 
dunk in Game Five; Olajuwon is 
heard mumbling something 
about being “really tired” fol­
lowing the game. The Los Ange­
les Lakers defeat Seattle in three 
games. Magic Johnson is acti­
vated for the playoffs and aver­
ages five points and 24 assists 
per game in the series.
SECOND ROUND
Eastern Conference: Orlando 
defeats Charlotte in five games. 
Shaquille O’Neal scores 41 
points per game against Alonzo 
Mourning and the Hornets, then 
proclaims that “Shaq Daddy’s 
got the skills, baby. We’re going 
all the way.”
Indiana beats New York. Af­
ter John Starks, Charles Oakley 
and Patrick Ewing are assessed 
flagrant fouls in the first five 
minutes of Game One, the series 
is awarded to the Pacers by 
David Stern, Commissioner of 
the NBA, who happens to be at 
the game. Spike Lee announces 
that his new favorite team is 
now Indiana, for as he says, “I 
love that Reggie Miller. Boy, can 
he shoots
Western Conference: San An­
tonio defeats Los Angeles in four 
games. The Lakers go in the 
tank after Magic Johnson is 
knocked out of the series in Game 
One after a hard foul by Dennis 
Rodman. However, Rodman
plays the rest of the series. He 
simply changes his hair color 
from yellow to turquoise and the 
name on the back of his jersey to 
“Rodmann.” The officials don’t 
pick up on it.
Phoenix defeats Utah in four 
games. In the press conference 
after Game Four, Charles 
Barkley tells reporters that the 
Suns are the best team in the 
league. He adds that his Elmer 
Fudd impression is pretty good 
too.
CONFERENCE FINALS
Eastern Conference: Indiana 
stretches Orlando to seven 
games before losing. In Game 
Seven, Lee stands up during at 
the start of the fourth quarter 
and begins to taunt Shaq, who 
goes onto score 111 points in the 
stanza, including 41-of-41 from 
the free throw line. He ends the 
game with an even 150, and the 
Magic go on to win 152—100.
O’Neal credits Lee for his of­
fensive output: “He said I wasn’t 
half the player Reggie Miller is. 
Reggie’s good and all, but c’mon, 
I’m Shaq Fu.,} Following the 
game, Miller and Lee embrace 
at midcourt; the next day, Lee 
announces Miller will star in 
Lee’s next motion picture, a bas­
ketball film. The title? “Shaq 
Fu’s Pretty Good.”
Western Conference: San An­
tonio defeats Phoenix in seven 
games. Barkley misses the final 
game after breaking his hand 
punching Rodman in the head 
at a bar the night before the 
game. Rodman is issued a fla­
grant foul by the arresting of­
ficer, but Stem says that since 
it’s only one flagrant foul on 
Rodmann; he’s able to play.
At the press conference fol­
lowing Game Seven, Barkley 
says that the Suns are the best 
team in the league, and that he’s 
got a pretty good right cross. 
FINALS
After six grueling contests, the 
teams are tied at three games 
apiece, with O’Neal and San 
Antonio center David Robinson 
playing to a classic standoff. In 
Game Seven, the two continue 
their brilliant play, with 
Robinson scoring 94 points and 
O’Neal 92.
After eight overtimes, the 
teams are tied at 141, and there 
are only two players left on the 
court — O’Neal and Rodman. 
Rodman has changed his hair 
color 11 times during the game, 
one after each of his .flagrant 
fouls, each of which knocked one 
of O’Neal’s teammates out of the 
contest. He also adds 11 “n’s” to
the end of his jersey, which ob­
scure most of his tattoos.
The refs don’t figure out how 
the Spurs could get away with 
playing 23 players when the ros­
ter limit is 12, but assume they 
overlooked one of the rules in the 
rule book.
Meanwhile, O’Neal has fouled 
out the other 11 Spurs’ players, 
but has yet to make a free throw. 
As time expires in the ninth over­
time, Shaq is flagrantly fouled by 
Rodman, who runs back to the 
lockerroom only to discover he is 
out of both hair coloring and “n’s.”
The referees call a conference 
and come to the conclusion that
they’ve been duped. Two officers 
arrest Rodman, and O’Neal is 
awarded two foul shots for every 
flagrant foul Rodman has com­
mitted in the game. He misses all 
24, and bedlam ensues.
There are no Spurs left, arid 
there is no precedent for this type 
of situation. After talking it over 
with NBC announcer Marv 
Albert, Stem decides to give the 
trophy to the Spurs, under the 
condition that the Spurs don’t 
post bond for Rodman, who is 
being held in a local jail. Spurs 
coach Bob Hill agrees, and the 
Spurs are crowned champions.
Albert is asked after the game
what he said to convince Stern to 
award the title to San Antonio. 
He shrugs and says, “Spike Lee 
told me I would star in his next 
movie if I convinced Stem to give 
it to the Spurs.”

Holocaust marks
Painful past still lingersdark spot in world history
CMU remembers tragedy
By SHIRA FELDMAN
Tartan Staffwriter
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
In honor of Yom HaShoah, the chosen day of international 
observance of those who endured the horrors of the Holocaust, 
a series of Holocaust presentations will take place on cam­
pus. The events are scheduled to take place from April 24 
until April 27, the actual day of Yom HaShoah.
The programs have been organized by Students 
Helping to Organize Awareness about the Holo­
caust or SHOAH, a special interest group of 
CMU’s Jewish student organization group, 
Hillel.
SHOAH was founded by Ethan 
Yungerman, afreshman architecture 
major. The group consists of ap­
proximately 10 students.
Yungerman started the pro­
gram based on the experi­
ences of his grandpar­
ents, who are survi­
vors of the Holo­
caust. He feels 
people 
must con­
tinue to
remem­
ber the in­
cidents that 
took place dur­
ing the Holocaust. 
“I am a first gen­
eration American. My 
grandparents were in the 
Holocaust, and I grew up with 
their stories. But the reality is, 
they’re in their seventies now. As 
the survivors pass away, so do their 
stories. It is necessary to keep on re­
membering so that we do not forget what 
happened to them,” he said.
Jeremy Kriegel, a creative writing and art 
major and SHOAH member, agrees with 
Yungerman.
“As far as Jewish students go, we’ve had the Holocaust 
drilled in our heads from day one. But the truth is, as soon 
as we forget it happened, it will happen again,” he said. It is 
because of these feelings that the concerned students have taken 
action.
The following events have been planned to take place in honor of 
those who died and survived the Holocaust:
On April 24, an installation will be erected on the front lawn of CFA. 
It consists of a 40-foot-long wire fence with eight faceless mannequins 
behind it.
“The purpose of this installation is to show that this has happened in 
the past, and it can happen again. The faceless mannequins illustrate 
that anyone can experience this maltreatment,” said Yungerman.
On April 25, a poetry reading will be held, entitled “Poetry of Preju­
dice.” The exact time and place of the poetry reading has yet to be 
announced. The Wave, a movie which dramatizes and details how a 
history teacher creates a strong fascist movement, will be shown on April 
26 in Doherty Hall.
A presentation entitled “Reflections on the Holocaust: Experience on 
the 50th Anniversary of Liberation” will take place on April 27.
During the lecture, Marni Greenwald, a freshman in H&SS, will speak 
about her experiences during the March of the Living.
Following Greenwald’s presentation, Steven Fenves, a civil engineer­
ing professor at CMU, who is a survivor of Auschwitz, will speak on his 
Holocaust experiences.
To close the program, sophomore drama majors Doug Howe and 
Tressa Pope will perform a dramatic piece written by Leigh Silverman, 
a junior directing major. The dramatic piece is based on the true story 
of a Jewish girl’s experience during the Holocaust.
Finally, from April 26 until April 27, a 24-hour name-reading will be 
held to commemorate the six million Jews who died during the Holo­
caust. The reading will take place in front of the fence at midnight on 
April 26.
The reading is being organized by Daniella Topol, a junior directing 
major in the drama department. Topol was inspired to have the readings
T
his Thursday, April 27, marks Yom HaShoah, or Remem 
brance Day, the International Holocaust memorial. 
This day is designated to commemorate all who 
perished during the genocide of Nazi Germany, 
1933-45, as well as to honor the heroism of 
those who survived and those who helped others to survive.
The term “The Holocaust” refers to the destruction of 
European Jews from the years 1933-45. In 1932, the 
Nazi movement, headed by Adolf Hitler, began to 
surge through Germany. Nazism was charac­
terized by extreme nationalism and in­
tense anti-Semitism.
When Hitler took over the entire gov­
ernment of Germany in 1934, declar­
ing himself both President and 
Chancellor of the Third Reich,
Jewish citizens were singled 
out as a scapegoat group 
on which to blame 
Germany’s troubles.
Germany, at that 
time, was suf­
fering ex­
treme
poverty 
and infla­
tion resulting 
from its World 
War I reparation 
payments, and Hitler 
blamed one group for the 
misery existing in the coun­
try — Jews.
German Jews were not exter­
minated immediately after Hitler 
came to power. First, they were vic­
timized politically: their citizenship was 
•revoked, they were banned from many pub­
lic places, and they were forced to wear yellow 
stars on their clothing, which prominently la­
beled them as Jewish. The situation grew steadily 
•worse.
By 1938, pogroms, or legal organized massacres of the 
Jews, were occurring regularly all over Germany. As Hitler 
conquered more countries, his domain expanded—to Austria,
Czechoslovakia, and Poland. Soon his government, the Third 
Heich, included almost all of Eastern Europe.
; In 1941, the large-scale deportation of Jews to concentration camps 
;began. Hitler produced what he called “The Final Solution to the Jewish 
Problem.”
; He intended to purge the world of all Jewish blood. Prisoners in extermina­
tion camps were gassed, executed, or otherwise slaughtered, and were buried in 
mass graves. Hitler kept this blood-bath a secret.
Outside of Germany, few people knew of the carnage taking place. It was only 
after the Allies liberated Europe in 1945 that they witnessed the proof of Nazi 
atrocities and found the hideous remains of the genocide.
! Though most of the captured Nazis were later executed for war crimes, and 
I People throughout the world have been educated about the catastrophe, Jews 
¡around the world are still concerned about their future.
! Elie Weisel, a Holocaust survivor who authored several books on the subject, 
Wrote: “What happened once, could happen again. ... As far as the Jewish people 
are concerned, the world has remained unchanged: as indifferent to our fate as to 
its own.”
Remembrance Day was created as a means to keep the memory of the Holocaust 
alive. If people remember and think about the Holocaust, we can prevent anything 
like it from ever happening again.
Most students at Carnegie Mellon are very aware of this issue: “Whenever I read 
about it or study it, I think of the social implications,” said junior social and decision 
lienees major Maria Casella.
Alyssa Newman, a sophomore in industrial management, said: “I think [Holo­
caust awareness] is important for the future — trying to stop the Holocaust from 
happening again. Other things like it are happening today. Like in Bosnia.”
“[The Holocaust] symbolized the hatred of people that are different from the 
Realistic standards that society imposes today,” said junior electrical engineering 
toajor Tahmin Clarke.
“Being a minority, it also reminded me of such events as slavery. I don’t think 
about it every day ... but it creates an impact in our thinking concerning race/

CMU students perceive racial divisions to varying degrees
By MICHELLE HALL
Tartan Staffwriter
! Any student who has spent time 
going through application publi­
cations knows that CMU boasts 
diversity as a valuable aspect of 
its education. CMU’s student 
population includes a variety of 
different races, religions, and 
lifestyles. However, often stu­
dents, especially minority stu­
dents, come to think of them­
selves as misled into thinking 
that CMU has more to offer in the 
arena of race relations.
I Some students find that CMU 
has less minority and interna­
tional students than they ex­
pected, and that at times, they 
encounter what can be construed 
as strict racial cliques. Other stu­
dents find the diversity of the 
student body refreshing and bet­
ter than they would have ex­
pected. But what are race rela­
tions at CMU really like?
; “In my interactions, I’ve had no 
problems with race relations,” 
said Brenden Mielke, a sopho- 
jnore in Industrial Management. 
Pecause CMU students in gen­
eral tend to be apathetic, race 
Relations do not often become an 
issue, but the condition of race 
Relations are not something that 
goes unnoticed.
; “I think race relations can defi- 
tiitely be improved,” said Lester 
Manzano, a Filipino sophomore 
Psychology major. “I was at a 
Student Affairs dinner last week 
intended for a bunch of sopho­
mores to get together with people 
like Anne Witchner and talk 
about what’s going on at CMU. 
There was a minority student 
there who only wanted to talk 
about race relations—it seemed 
to be his sole reason for going to 
the dinner. He talked about how 
Admissions is misleading in rep­
resenting race relations and said
that he had to find his social con­
tacts at Pitt because there are so 
few African-American students 
here. I felt a little uncomfortable 
with that.”
MI think race relations can be 
improved... because people tend 
to cling to other people who are 
like them,” said Channon Kelly, 
a freshman in Chemical Engi­
neering. ‘This is good because it 
helps you preserve your culture, 
but it also takes away from di­
versity.”
Only seven percent of CMU 
students are ethnic minorities, 
less than at many other schools. 
“I believe that race relations at 
Carnegie Mellon might be im­
proved considerably,” said Joe 
Trotter, a professor in the His­
tory Department. “We know from 
some recent data that the num­
ber of minority faculty and gradu­
ate students at Carnegie Mellon 
is significantly lower than else­
where.”
The University’s answer to a 
low percentage of minority stu­
dents is programs like the 
Carnegie Mellon Action Program 
(CMAP). Freshmen students who 
join CMAP come to campus sev­
eral weeks before everyone else, 
and have access to a counseling 
staff and tutoring program spe­
cifically for minority students, 
among other things.
“CMAP has some good pro­
grams, like a tutoring program. I 
haven’t done much with CMAP, 
but it has its good points and its 
bad points,” said Kelly. As is the 
case with anything that re­
sembles affirmative action, there 
is both support and ambivalence.
“Affirmative action was estab­
lished to alleviate problems dire
30 years ago. If we still have these 
programs today, if affirmative 
action is not solving these prob­
lems, there’s something wrong in 
general with these programs and
they should be reevaluated,” said 
Manzano.
“My concern is that it seems 
like there’s a lot of money being 
spent on CMAP, and I’m not sure 
how much good it’s doing. I don’t
you more aware and from that 
comes tolerance.”
“I think ethnic minority stu­
dent organizations are well- 
intentioned and that their goals 
are positive, but I’m nor sure if
“It seems the students here 
[CMAP], are part of a family, and 
that’s both good and bad. Ethnic 
minority students here are close, 
but they’re not huge part of the 
student population. The campus
know where that money is go­
ing,” said Kelly.
This feeling of misgiving about 
CMAP and ethnic minority stu­
dent organizations like the Asian 
Student Organization and Spirit 
seems to exist in degrees among 
the students here.
“I think race relations here are 
fine,” said Khalil Muri, a Malay­
sian junior in Industrial Man­
agement.
“The fact is that most people 
who come here are fairly intelli­
gent or from open backgrounds. 
CMU’s diversity kind of makes
their intentions are always actu­
alized. Still, they are an asset to 
the University,” said Mielke.
Allison Greene, an Admissions 
counselor who specializes in re­
cruiting minority students, works 
in tandem with CMAP in orga­
nizing programs intended to in­
troduce students to community 
life on campus.
A CMU alumna herself, Greene 
is certainly aware of the concern 
over low rates of minority stu­
dents at CMU. She has a unique 
and informed opinion on the sub­
ject of race relations.
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Staff
atmosphere here is so static. I 
believe that there are people here 
who are unhappy with the racial 
makeup, but you wouldn’t see 
them protesting.”
Above all things, it seems stu­
dents here would like to see more 
interaction between students of 
different races. “There’s probably 
not enough interaction between 
all the races. Someday, I hope 
that a group of friends can be 
from all different cultural back­
grounds,” said Muri.
“Some of my friends just started 
an organization for Filipino sttt-
dents on campus. I think these 
kinds of organizations have to be 
geared toward something posj. 
tive, like having goals of promot­
ing educational and cultural 
awareness, not just so you can 
talk to someone of the same race 
as you,” said Manzano.
Race relations are indeed a con­
cern for the administration and 
has been the focus of much recent 
effort. “I think several important 
developments suggest that the 
university is moving in the right 
direction. First the University is 
moving toward the completion of 
a three-year study of the status of 
underrepresented minorities 
which aims to assess our suc­
cesses and failures in minority 
group relations. Second, our Uni­
versity continues to support pro­
gram like CMAP, which is de­
signed to improve the recruit­
ment and retention of minority 
students,” said Trotter.
In addition to these efforts are 
the activities promoted and sup­
ported by the University during 
Black history month, as well as 
other minority programs sup­
ported throughout other months.
Many hope that the report of 
the Commission on Underrepre­
sented minorities will shed some 
light on action to be taken to 
improve relations among stu­
dents of different races at CMU.
Perhaps a change in the con­
ception of what diversity is will 
help to alleviate some of the ten­
sion surrounding racial relations 
at CMU.
“People seem to think diversity 
means a majority of minority stu­
dents. There is a very strong di­
versity here,” said Kelly.
Mielke agreed, “I think when 
CMU says they have a diverse 
campus they mean more than 
race. They mean different per­
sonalities and interests. That’s 
my interpretation.”

Contract jeopardizes student financial aid
By TRICIA DAVIS
Tartan Staffwriter
The Republican “Contract with 
America” proposes to eliminate 
or reduce federal student aid for 
undergraduate and graduate stu­
dents.
Students at CMU need to be 
aware of the proposed recissions 
by this proposal and let their own 
member of Congress know how 
they feel about it.
Students, teachers, administra­
tors, parents,everyone needs to 
get involved to save financial aid 
for students and to support a fu­
ture where everyone has the op­
portunity for higher education, 
regardless of race or class.
The Republicans are proposing 
to eliminate several major pro­
grams that provide aid to stu­
dents, including the Javits Fel­
lowships, Harris Fellowships, 
State Student Incentive Grants, 
National Science Scholars schol­
arship program, Federal Work- 
Study, and Supplemental Stu­
dent Grants.
In addition, they are proposing 
to limit the availability of loan 
funds. Republicans have proposed 
eliminating the subsidized 
Stafford Loan, leaving only the 
unsubsidized Stafford Loan.
The American Council on Edu­
cation estimates that the loss of 
the in-school interest exemption 
would result in a 41 percent to 48 
percent increase in total debt for 
a student taking out student loans 
over a four-year undergraduate 
degree and a six-year graduate
Total loan repayments could 
increase by as much as $339 per 
month.
The Council also reports that 
all of the proposed changes would 
reduce student aid spending by 
>20 billion.
Walter Cathie, associate vice- 
president for Financial Resources 
at CMU said, “We are very con­
cerned about the cuts because 
..there are programs here that 
could be eliminated. Programs 
like Federal Work Study, the 
Supplemental Student Grant, 
and the Perkins Loan could be 
subject to being cut. The Work 
Study program is really popular 
and we get over a million [dol­
lars] for that every year and we 
don’t want to see that go. The 
Supplemental Student Grant and
the Perkins Loan 
are important, too.
We would lose close 
to $2 million in aid 
from the Federal 
Government. CMU 
is fighting to make 
as few cuts as pos­
sible by communi­
cating with lobby­
ists. In addition, I 
am working on a 
plan that would al­
low CMU to borrow 
private loans for 
students.”
Cathie disap­
proves of the cuts 
in student aid. He 
said, “I’ve been in 
this for 25 years 
and this is the 
worst that I’ve ever 
seen. There are lots 
of ways for the gov­
ernment to attack 
this that make 
more sense. For ex­
ample, the most 
logical would be for 
the Federal offi­
cials to cut down 
on tax fraud abuse. It’s not perva­
sive at CMU because we pay at­
tention to it by verifying finan­
cial aid forms. CMU will actually 
take back financial aid packages 
if fraud exists.”
Laurie Loftus, Ph.D. graduate 
student in literary and cultural 
studies at CMU, is appalled by 
the proposed cuts.
She said, “I think it is repre­
hensible and it is going to in­
crease poverty. It’s going to rein­
force privilege and close the gates 
on those who might have a chance 
with guaranteed student loans 
and subsidized loans. And it is 
going to hit people who are al­
ready in the lower classes, which 
is racially defined. This should 
not only be an issue for people on 
loans, everyone should think 
about how it is going to affect 
society as a whole. Otherwise it’s 
a ‘not in my backyard’ policy.”
Francine Gemperle/Tartan Art Co-editor 
Contract with America could eliminate many students’ financial aid programs.
dents could accumulate 10 years 
of interest on their loans which 
they would have to begin paying 
back once they graduate. I agree 
that the Federal budget needs to 
be reduced but there are better 
ways to go about it then this.” 
Kevin G. Boyer is the Execu­
tive Director of the National As­
sociation of Graduate-Profes­
sional Students (NAGPS), a non­
profit organization representing 
over 450,000 graduate students.
He advises students, faculty, 
parents, and administrators to 
send email letters to Congress to 
“save-student-aid@netcom.com” 
on the Internet.
The letters are printed out ev­
ery two weeks and hand-deliv­
ered to members of Congress.
Dominic J. Perri, Legislative 
Concerns Coordinator of NAGPS, 
said, “Lately opponents to stu­
dent aid have made statements 
Tim Mallo, a graduate student that trivialize the effect of these
majoring in chemical engineer­
ing said, “The proposed cuts are 
going to have a great impact on 
graduate students more so then 
undergraduate students because 
taking away the subsidized in­
terest loans would force students 
to pay interest for the loans while 
they are in college. Graduate stu-
cuts. These cuts are real, unwise, 
and undermine the very founda­
tion of education.”
Toni Rosati, Director of Com­
munication Exchange for 
NAGPS, said, “The Republican 
leaders are slashing education 
without thinking about the ef­
fects. They are shifting us from a
debtor nation to a nation of debt­
ors. Fifty percent of graduate and 
professional students are mar­
ried and have children. This is 
going to affect families, children, 
and make it so our children will 
not have any education at all.”
Governor Arne Carlson of Min­
nesota and Governor George 
Bush of Texas are against the 
cuts in student aid.
They have both issued state­
ments that, “quality graduate 
education is crucial to the global 
competitiveness of the United 
States."Meanwhile, Speaker 
Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Sena­
tor Rick Santorum (R-Pa.), who 
both received student aid to ob­
tain their degrees, are in favor of 
reducing student aid.
In an effort to stop the student 
aid cuts, many schools across the 
nation have been rallying, invit­
ing congressmen to campus, and 
getting students’ opinions heard 
by the mainstream media.
You can call or write to your 
Representative and say, “I’m a 
registered voter and I’ll vote 
against you if you vote to cut fi­
nancial aid for students.” Call 
(202) 225-3121 and ask to be con­
nected to your Representative.

Campus community 
recalls Holocaust
HOLOCAUST, from page 1
based on her experiences in school.
“I attended a Jewish Day School for 13 years and learned to 
value the importance of Yom HaShoah. A teacher of mine held 
a 24-hour name reading in which I had the honor of participat­
ing in. To say just a few names brings you one step, maybe just 
a baby step, but one step nonetheless, closer to understanding 
what six million means. Rather than not understanding what 
this genocide means, why not try?” she said.
Kreigel also feels that the name-reading will help people to 
understand that the death toll resulting from the Holocaust is 
astounding.
“Six million is a large number. People, no matter how intelli­
gent they are, cannot comprehend six million. Part of this 
reading will illustrate the magnitude of how many people did 
perish. However, we’re only reading Jews. That makes up only 
half of the number who died,” he said. Kriegel will be a reader 
at the name-reading vigil as well as the poetry reading. The 
poetry reading will focus on intolerance of any kind.
“We wanted to explain anti-Semitism so that we can reach 
more people. Poetry is a powerful way to communicate. A lot of 
people don’t open themselves to poetry, but I hope in this case 
they will. Many people can identify with intolerance. Students 
can learn and gain so much through other students’ experi­
ences,” said Kriegel.
However, Kriegel, as well as Yungerman, is well aware that 
students- at CMU are not extremely receptive to the few pro­
grams that go on here.
“It scares the hell out of me that I’ve been planning this since 
J anuary and that the possibility of no one coming is there. I feel 
that some students will come, but I’m not very optimistic. In 
fact, I’m planning for the worst so that if it happens, I can deal 
with it,” Yungerman said.
Kriegel believes students may not attend the programs be­
cause they have such full schedules. He said, “Students won’t 
get involved not because they are lazy, but because they have 
so many other things to do.
’’Despite this fact, Yungerman is very pleased with the 
willingness of students to participate in the name-reading. He 
said “Everyone knows what type of students there are here. 
People never get involved in anything, but we already have 96 
students who are going to read.”
However, Topol explains that getting the readers was not as 
easy as it sounds.
She said, “It’s been a challenge, but not a struggle, to find 
readers. I find that people are really interested in reading, 
apprehensive about mispronouncing names, and genuinely 
supportive. I have about two-thirds of the readers scheduled, 
and it really is a mix of faculty, staff and students from all walks 
of life on this campus.”
If you are interested in reading names at the vigil, contact 
Daniella Topol at dt27. If you are interested in participating in 
the poetry reading, contact Jeremy Kriegel at jk8p. If you have 
questions pertaining, to any of the events, contact Ethan 
Yungerman at ey29.

religious relations.” The 
prevalence of such publicity 
as Schindler’s List makes Ho­
locaust-related issues very 
visible.
Though CMU students are 
not, in general, overwhelm­
ingly involved in political ac­
tivism, the Holocaust is one 
issue about which everyone 
is concerned. “As a general 
rule, I think that the Holo­
caust is one of the few Jewish 
phenomena around which 
young Jewish adults are still 
willing to rally. I do think 
they know about it ... and 
they absolutely care,” said 
Ruth Slater, a coordinator at 
Hillel.
“Other than a cursory over­
view in high school, I learned 
about [the Holocaust] mainly 
from Schindler’s List” said 
Rick Dennis, a Pitt student. 
“It’s good because it height­
ened my awareness,” said 
Clarke. Abraham Joshua 
Heschel once wrote: “Six mil­
lion were wiped off the face of 
the earth. And there is the 
danger that they will also be 
annihilated from our memo­
ries. Are they doomed to a 
two-fold annihilation?”
Heschel (and Weisel) would 
be proud to know that stu­
dents, at least students of 
CMU, have not forgotten the 
lessons illustrated so force- 
Mly by the Holocaust.
Freshman Jay Kim said: 
The world learned a lot from 
the Holocaust. History is 
based on it. The Holocaust is 
used as apolitical mechanism 
to prevent such things from 
happening again. It may not 
be something I think about 
daily, but it could have hap­
pened to me. It would have 
left its mark on me. It left its 
mark on the world”.
The Holocaust is an issue 
that is taken quite seriously 
around campus, CMU stu­
dents, as well as students 
from surrounding universi­
ties, are dedicated to remem­
bering this tragedy and the 
implications it has for hu­
manity.

Old Man Donner turns kitchen into Little Italy
Old Man Donner
by Jason Roth
We’re going for a record here, 
folks — the fastest Old Man 
Donner ever. Fm due to leave 
town in mere minutes, yet I’m 
taking time out of my ever-so- 
packed schedule to bring the 
penultimate passel of... ah, the 
hell with it, I don’t have time for 
alliteration today (I’m sorry if 
that breaks your hearts, but 
you’re old enough to know the 
truth: I have to think about this 
prose that seems to fall so effort­
lessly from my fingertips; almost 
as bad as learning about the Eas­
ter Bunny, eh?).
Anyway, next week’s the last 
column, and, appropriately 
enough (when I think ahead — 
known as Prometheus — I am a 
force unstoppable by Man or Na­
ture, although Kathie Lee occu­
pies a dimension wholly other, 
and thus has limited abilities to 
thwart my designs), it’s all des­
serts.
This week, however, we make a 
final foray into the fulfilling world 
of Florentine... damn. Whatever. 
It’s Italy again, folks. Two super- 
simple pasta sauces:
Butter and Cheese
Just as simple as it sounds. Get 
a pound of pasta (homemade is so 
far superior for this ... well, at 
least get cappelini), boil it. Grate 
a cup of Parmesan.
A lesson here: the real stuff is 
parmigiano-reggiano, and it’s 
regulated, just like champagne, 
balsamic vinegar, or Mickey 
Mouse; the true stuff is imported 
from Italy, costs ~$10/pound, and 
is worth every penny.
Imagine Parmesan so good you
can eat it sliced like Swiss or 
cheddar. So one of these days, get 
your ass over to the Strip, go to 
one of the fine Italian shops, and 
get a half pound of Parmesan 
(only $8.50/pound). Use it on sal­
ads and regular pasta, but espe­
cially use it for this dish.
Get a half stick of butter (spring 
for Land O’ Lakes; no substitut­
ing here). Get a big bowl.
When the pasta is done, put it 
in the bowl and add four table­
spoons of cheese; toss thoroughly, 
distributing the cheese well 
and allowing it to melt 
onto the pasta. Now 
add half the but­
ter and four 
more tablespoon 
of cheese, again 
mixing thor­
oughly.
Add the rest of 
the cheese, give 
a mild toss, and, 
finally, the last 
of the butter, 
tossing until it 
melts. Serve as 
soon as possible, 
with more grated cheese 
available at the table. Wow, is 
that good. I suppose it might 
be considered fattening, but 
I don’t buy it.
A word about 
pasta: as I said, fine 
pasta is excellent, but 
so is stuffed pasta 
(tortellini, ravioli), so try a 
bunch of things. You can see 
how easy it is, and there’s no 
prep time (well, grating the 
cheese....).
Spaghetti Aia e Oio
1 lb spaghetti
1/3 cup extra virgin olive oil
2 tsp minced garlic
chopped red hot chili pepper to
taste
2 Tb chopped Italian parsley
This is the classic Roman olive 
oil and garlic sauce; quick to pre­
pare, but an acquired taste. Re­
gardless, it’s worth a try. A few 
words about ingredients: 
Marcella will hear nothing about
any pasta but spaghetti, so don’t 
mess. I don’t always use the extra 
virgin, but for this, you can’t 
skimp (compare the bottles in the 
store — see how much deeper 
and richer the e.v. is). Italian 
parsley is totally different from 
garnish; it’s tasty, vital, and 
pretty cheap (a huge bunch for 
maybe two bucks). Finally, I 
cheated and used powdered pep­
per, so I won’t complain if you do,
and impossible to overcome in 
the dish; better undercook than 
over.
When the pasta’s done, toss it 
together with the contents of the 
pan, as with the above recipe, 
and then add the parsley, again 
tossing. Serve immediately.
Finally, some cooking fun. A 
very good friend from Croatia 
taught me this recipe, and I wish 
you luck with it.
Potato Gnocchi with 
Gorgonzola 
Sauce
Gnocchi:
11/2 lb boiling 
potatoes 
11/2 cups flour 
Boil the potatoes 
until they become tender and 
the skins come off easily; drain 
them , and remove the skins. 
Puree and put on a counter; 
add most of the flour, and 
knead into a dough. Only 
add the remaining flour 
if it’s very sticky (it must 
be somewhat sticky). 
Dust your surface with 
flour and roll the dough into a 
couple 1" worms; slice into 3/4" 
sections. Now take each and work 
it against the tines 
of a fork with 
your thumb, so 
one: ,side has 
ridges and 
the other 
has a 
thumbprint; 
these areFrancine Gemperle/Tartan Art Co-Editor , , . nto hold
the sauce.
This is another dish done while Get a big pot of boiling water, 
the pasta boils; put everything and put in a couple test-gnocchi;
too.
but the parsley in a small sauce­
pan while the water boils, and 
cook on medium low until the 
garlic grows golden. Beware! 
Overdone garlic is easy to get,
drop them, wait until they swim 
to the top, and count 10; remove. 
If they’re too floury, count 12, if 
they’re almost dissolved, count 8. 
Boil no more than can float at the
surface at one time. Good luck.
Nina (my friend) cheated and 
used spuds (powdered mashed 
potatoes), and I can’t argue with 
her results, so you can save 
trouble by simply making a batch 
of mashed potatoes (don’t add 
milk or cream) and adding flour. 
Now, the sauce:
1/4lb gorgonzola (oh, I do go for 
a nice spot of gorgonzola)
1/3 cup milk 
2 Tb butter
1/2 cup heavy whipping cream 
1/3 cup Parmesan (hey, maybe 
you’ve some left over from recipe 
#1?)
Use a big pan that can hold the 
gnocchi or whatever pasta you 
choose; put the first three ingre­
dients in the pan and heat on low, 
mashing the cheese and blending 
with the milk and butter; remove 
from the heat until the pasta’s 
almost done (you’ll need a minute 
to finish the sauce).
When the time comes, put in 
the cream and stir over medium- 
low heat until slightly reduced; 
put in the pasta as it’s done, and 
when it’s all in the pot, put in the 
Parmesan and toss. Serve.
Here’s the best part of this 
whole meal — dipping bread in 
the sauce.
First time I attempted it, the 
gnocchi sucked, but all was OK 
because we had the sauce for 
bread. So go out and get a loaf to 
accompany this.
There. I’m done, and it took too 
damn long, and now I’ll have to 
climb in the luggage compart­
ment to get on board ... damn.

latest project is a limited 
called Star Slammers, for the 
group Malibu.
be it as a writer, artist, or 
Simonson began working in com- 
in the mid-1970s after completing art 
school. Prior to attending the Rhode
Island School of Design, Simonson was a 
geology major at Amherst, specializing 
in Paleontology (which isn’t surprising 
when you notice his signature is in the 
shape of a dinosaur). It was during this 
time that Simonson was 
a huge fan of Marvel 
Comics with Steve 
Ditko, Stan Lee, and 
Jack Kirby. Back then, 
said Simonson, “You 
didn’t have to deal drugs 
to buy every comic that 
came out.”
For his senior thesis,
Simonson made a comic 
book eventually pub­
lished by the Washing­
ton Science Fiction As­
sociation to promote 
Washington, DC’s bid to 
host the World Science 
Fiction Convention in 
1974. DC won the bid, 
and Simonson got a job 
in comics after showing 
the comic around New 
York City.
Simonson says he has 
an “eclectic” list of influences on his 
writing, with J.R.R. Tolkien’s Lord of 
the Rings and The Hobbit being very 
prominent on that list. Especially with 
mythological titles like Thor, “My back­
ground owes a great debt to [Tolkien’s] 
books.” Among comics writers, Archie 
Goodwin stands out as somewhat of a 
mentor for Simonson.
If his writing influences are eclectic, 
then Simonson’s artistic influences could 
best be described as international. He 
lists the Frenchman Moebius (The Air­
tight Garage), Sergio Toppi (El Cid) from 
Spain and Jim Holdaway, the original 
artist for the British strip Modesty Blaise 
as some of his favorites. Of course, like
for nearly all artists in comics today, 
Jack “The King” Kirby has also been an 
inspiration for Simonson.
Although his wife Louise is an accom­
plished writer 0Superman: Man of Steel, 
X-Factor), there has 
never been any com- 
petition between 
them, with Louise 
doing monthly 
books and Walter 
doing more sporadic 
work. “I’m sponging 
off her real job; it’s a 
great way to live,” 
Walter admitted 
with laughter.
Actually, prior to 
their marriage, she 
was editor on 
Battlestar Galac- 
tica, which he wrote. 
“Now I can consult 
with comic’s best 
editor and it’s not 
even a phone call 
away.”
Simonson’s up­
coming projects fol­
lowing the conclusion of the Star 
Slammers mini-series include writing 
Tarzan Vs. Predator from Dark Horse, 
Weapon Zero from Image’s Top Cow, and 
an eight-page black & white Batman 
story for a new DC book. Also in May 
Simonson will begin working on a major 
project which he was not yet able to 
explain.
He did hint that it would be something 
similar to John Byrne’s Darkseid/ 
Galactus crossover and it should be re­
leased in 4-6 months.
Jason Andracki is a sophomore profes­
sional writing major. He is all out of 
witty sayings.

Simonson’s work on mythological 
titles like Thor is galvanized by an 
appreciation for J.R.R. Tolkien.
Cabaret thrills audience
By DAN GOLDWASSER
Tartan Staffwriter
Cabaret, the classic musical by John 
Kander, Fred Ebb, and Joe Masteroff, 
entertained audiences Friday and Sat­
urday night in the Kresge Theater in 
CFA. Taking place in 
pre-Hitler Germany,
Cabaret centers on 
the relationship of 
Clifford Bradshaw 
(Patrick Wilson), an 
American writer who 
sees through the Nazi 
propaganda, and 
Sally Bowles (Alison 
Mould), an English 
cabaret singer who 
wants nothing to do 
withpolitics, and 
feels that the Nazi 
party won’t affect her 
in the least.
The play also fo­
cuses on the ill-fated 
romance between a 
German landlady (Juliehera 
DeStefano) and her Jewish boarder 
(Michael Hollick), who doesn’t see 
what the Nazis could do to him be­
cause he is, after all, “a German”. 
These relationships unfold in the con­
text of a cabaret called the Kit Kat 
Klub, dominated by a master of cer­
emonies (Michael McEachran) and 
his staff of dance girls.
This production of Cabaret is di­
rected by Bonnie Walker, who was 
the assistant choreographer and cast 
member of the original 1966 Broad­
way production of Cabaret. The act­
ing was wonderful. Without a doubt, 
McEachran’s performance as the Em­
cee will be one to stick in my head for 
a very long time. As the one character 
who sees and understands everything, 
Emcee embodies the audience; know­
ing what is happening but being un­
able to intervene. Funny, slick, and 
full of energy, Emcee was definitely 
the star of the 
show, but that is 
not to say others 
did not stand out 
as well. Wilson and 
Mould are wonder­
ful as Bradshaw 
and Bowles. In 
fact, the entire cast 
should be com­
mended on their 
performance.
Walker should 
also be congratu­
lated on bringing 
Cabaret to life on 
the Kresge Stage, 
which seems a bit 
small at times. The 
sets themselves 
work through their simplicity. Kudos 
to the entire crew for keeping the per­
formance together. As a play which 
takes place just before the Nazi rise to 
power, the story deals with such sensi­
tive issues as racism, while at the 
same time coating the seriousness with 
the hum<?r and bawdiness of the Caba­
ret.
Filled with cabaret dancers, great 
music, and great acting, Cabaret is a 
fun play that should not be missed.
Cabaret is playing in the Kresge the­
ater through May 6. Call the Drama 
Box Office at 268-2407 to for reserva­
tions, ticket prices and show times.

Mould) and company entertain in

Exotica breaks bounds 
of imposed genre, style
By WLADIMIR LABEEKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
In a place where principles of film narrative are still followed 
blindly, in a time where rules for creative writing sell for $10 at 
Barnes & Nobles, any film with a notably different style is sure to 
cause some disconcert. However, Exotica is not supposed to leave you 
baffled. Atom Egoyan’s film moves like a poem without losing its 
sense of story nor its capacity, to leave the audience in awe. Like most 
of Egoyan’s films, Exotica's initial complexity resolves towards
simple beauty, indeed a piece 
of film verse.
Exotica could be the title 
of almost any Egoyan film. 
In Egoyan’s world, Toronto 
is full of beautiful lonely 
people, techno music inter­
twines with Armenian 
ghazals, and nobody is sure 
who to love. The shoreline at 
times seems convoluted 
enough to make you blink 
(more than twice). Francis, 
focuses on intertwining a tax auditor in Toronto, goes 
relationships and voyeurism through a every other night to Exotica, 
series of gripping characters. ^ exclusive strip clubj to
gaze at Christina. She’s a young stripper whose act involves her 
wearing a schoolgirl uniform and who turns out to be the love 
interest of both Eric, the club’s D J, and Zoe, the club owner (who is 
pregnant by Eric). Meanwhile Thomas, Francis’ auditee, goes every 
night to the ballet to solicit one-night stands among the male crowd.
Like all of his films, Exotica has its director, Egoyan, playing with 
a voyeuristic tone in the characters which ultimately reflects back on 
the audience. Our watching him turns into him watching us. The 
father of “Family viewing” tapes just about every sexual encounter 
of his. “The Adjuster” makes sure to get lots of photographs from his 
clients to make sure of “recovering their lives.” However, Egoyan is 
hot aiming to guilt-trip or criticize us. His characters, however 
eccentric they may seem at times, are just reflections of everyday 
people. Their habits and their tics (and Egoyan’s characters have 
more than plenty of them) do not put them in another level. Their 
¡tragedies can be our tragedies; their motives can be ours. Part of 
;»hat motivates Egoyan’s “backward” narrative structure is the 
¡desire to involve the audience. The film constantly plays with our 
¡knowing (or not knowing) what is going on, resulting in a film that 
¡is much more realistic than conventional movies.
Egoyan’s affair with voyeurism traces back to the basic tragedy of 
losing something. For Egoyan, film is about loss. His characters’ 
obsession with videotaping their lives reflects how loss is implied in 
this act. With Exotica, video is substituted with a strip dance 
routine. The wall is much thinner, the action is more human, but also 
more tragic.
Happily, Exotica finally seems to have drawn considerable popu­
larity for Egoyan. With plenty of awards but limited release, his 
Sims could now get a wider exposure in the future, which is a very 
£ood thing to happen in this world of Scottish pseudo-epics and dumb 
and dumber characters preaching “the meaning of life” while eating 
candy. Not to be devil’s advocate, I sincerely hope Exotica’s popular­
ity will not be rooted in its frequent nudity nor in its plain quirkiness.
Exotica is now playing daily at the Beehive. All other films men­
tioned are available on video.

typically excellent style in a 
role that is freakishly similar 
to Laurence Fishbume’s vio­

Just Cause, the tense psycho­

Not to be overlooked is the great 
casting of the supporting roles.

Michael Rapaport (True Ro­

rifically typecast into the role of 
Jimmy’s sleazy cousin, complete 
with his tough-guy New York 
accent and cocky demeanor. He 
is one to watch for in the future; 
his naturalism on-screen is sure 
to win him some leading roles in

Mortal Kombat 3 invades gameroom
By TOM HARPER
Tartan Staff writer
Probably the most ballyhooed 
video game of the year has come 
to the CMU Gameroom in the 
Student Center. Mortal Kombat
3, version Proto 4.0, has arrived, 
courtesy of H. Lazar and Son.
Mortal Kombat 3 is a continua­
tion of the highly popular Mortal 
Kombat series. The plot is as fol­
lows: Shao Kahn, ruler of the 
Outworld, won the last MK 
tournament allowing 
him to open the Portal 
between Earth and 
the Outworld over a 
large North
American city.
(I’m shaking al­
ready!)
Then, almost 
all of the inhab­
itants are
sucked away into 
the Out-world, 
leaving Earth a 
barren wasteland.
Amidst the ruins of 
the city 14 
Kombatants vie for con­
trol over the future of 
Earth and the Outworld.
MK3 utilizes the same game 
and graphics engines as MK2, 
with a few changes. A new “Run” 
button is added between the joy­
stick and punch buttons. The 
Kombatants are still digitized fig­
ures with the exception of two 
genetically-impossible charac­
ters, but some appear to be less 
refined than the relatively clean 
figures of MK2.
Most of the backgrounds are an 
abandoned cityscape with the 
Portal high above a distant tower. 
In B-movie fashion, some back­
grounds are genuinely terrifying 
at first, such as the Soul Cham­
ber, with a ghostly beam of green 
light complete with wailing Earth 
spirits.
The biggest change is the addi­
tion of normal-move combos, and 
a combo meter. In MK3 there are 
two ways to combo (hit your oppo­
nent more than once without 
them being able to retaliate). You 
can combo in the traditional MK 
style by “juggling” a hit opponent 
in the air. Also, you can string 
normal moves together with the
aid of the Run button to hit a 
standing opponent more than 
once. The number of hits plus the 
percent of damage done relative 
to the opponents (or your) maxi­
mum vitality is then shown. Un­
like the new Killer Instinct game, 
hits are not free due to stringed 
special moves.
Also implemented in MK3 are 
variable difficulty levels (for the
first two games, the difficulty was 
controlled by the arcade opera­
tor. After selecting your charac­
ter, three towers appear on the 
screen (Novice, Warrior, and 
Master) representing the differ­
ent levels. So don’t practice moves 
after selecting a character, be­
cause you’ll end up playing Mas­
ter level, which is not the least bit 
friendly! After completing a 
tower, the player must then fight 
Motaro, a giant centaur with a 
metallic tail (whereas the last 
two games have pitted the con­
testant against a four-armed be­
hemoth), and then Shao Kahn 
himself to win.
There are 14 playable charac­
ters to use so far, with a possible 
chip upgrade in the future con­
taining five more. Returning are 
Kano, Sonya (MK1), Jax, Kung 
Lao (MK2), Shang Tsung (who 
was an unplayable contestant in 
MK1, but playable in MK2), Liu 
Kang, and Sub-Zero in a new cos­
tume (Liu Kang and Sub-Zero
have been in all of the games).
New to the MK series are 
Sindel, Shao Kahn’s reincarnated 
Queen; Cyrax and Sektor, robotic 
ninjas(whoai); Stryker, a police­
man complete with grenades and 
a baton; Nightwolf, a Native 
American fighter; Kabal, a 
masked figure; and Sheeva, a 
four-armed half-woman, half­
dragon (my personal favorite).
The play is similar to MK2, 
complete with gratuitous blood 
flying after most hits. So far only
a few of those oh-so-nice ways 
to vent the day’s frustration 
(a.k.a. Fatalities) are 
known.
On the Pit 3 back­
ground (each game 
has had a Pit), a win­
ning player can knock 
the loser off by press­
ing forward three 
times followed by the 
Run button. This is a 
sight to see, especially 
since there are about 
six dismembered feet 
flying out of the carnage. 
Also if someone wants 
to challenge you on MK3, 
after you both select charac­
ters on the close-up screen there 
are six boxes at the bottom. The 
left player controls three boxes 
with their Low Punch, Block, and 
Low Kick buttons, and the right 
player controls the last three. Try 
not to press the buttons randomly, 
because one time I found myself 
starting with only half of my vi­
tality!
This is an early version, con­
tinuing the tradition of Midway 
releasing games in small stages 
(complete with glitches) started 
with MK2. For FAQs about the 
game consult the newsgroups 
alt.games.mk, rec.games.vi­
deo.arcade, and our own 
graffiti, gameroom.
Although MK3 has taken a lot 
of flak over the Net, I find it an 
enjoyable way to release some of 
that pent-up tension built up over 
the day. Happy fighting!
Tom Harper, physics/CS ma­
jor, English minor, and video 
game enthusiast, will probably 
vent his frustrations on MK3 a 
lot, especially after the last phys­
ics test.

Doomed arcade-game movies pave way for Mortal Kombat
FILE 13
By Carey Clevenger
In case you hadn’t heard, Mortal 
Kombat III hit the arcades this past 
week, including the arcade here at good 
ol’ CMU. I remember the excitement the 
first night that MKJI was in, and I’m
game. And although this may sound 
unusual — a movie based on a video 
game, instead of the other way around 
— it certainly is not the first of its kind.
Krull
I never really played this game; and 
the only time I ever saw it was on the 
TBS video game show “Starcade.” How­
ever, I distinctly remember the first level: 
the object was to run up a mountain, 
dodging boulders and picking up the 
four pieces of your mystical weapon, the 
Glaive. Someone finally realized that it 
would make a great movie, so they did it. 
Fortunately, they also realized that a 
serious script rewrite was necessary.
The plot of the film is this: a young 
prince must 
avenge the 
death of his fa­
ther and get 
his bride back 
from the evil 
monster (who 
remains one 
of the goofiest 
monsters I 
have ever 
seen). As per 
any fantasy 
quest film, he 
makes a lot of 
friends along 
the way, in­
cluding a wiz­
ard, a cyclops, 
an Emo Phil- 
lips-esque 
shape-shifter, 
and Liam 
Neeson. The 
boulder-evad- 
ing scene was left intact, with the excep­
tion that the Glaive is swimming in 
molten lava instead of in fragments. 
There’s something for everyone in this 
movie: lasers, ground-burrowing crea­
ture brains, swordfights, romance, un­
funny comedy, hot-footed horses, a castle/ 
spacecraft, and a flame-throwin’ wed­
ding ceremony.
Cloak and Dagger
Cloak and Dagger is an interesting 
case. I’m not sure if it’s a movie based on 
an arcade game, or if it’s a movie based 
on a fictional Atari game cartridge that 
they later made into a video game. But 
whatever the case, it’s worthy of note. 
Possibly learning a thing or two from 
Krull, the game itself was secondary, 
and really has nothing at all to do with 
the movie.
It seems that our young protagonist, 
Davey (Henry Thomas from E.T.) has 
gotten hold of a game cartridge intended 
for Russian spies. When one gets to the 
end of the game, their Atari video game 
system starts spitting out the plans for 
some Top Secret U.S. fighter jet. It’s a 
madcap romp as Davey tries to evade 
the spies. Dabney Coleman plays a dual 
role as Davey’s father, and Jack Flack, 
Davey’s imaginary spy friend. Even af­
ter one viewing, this film will have you 
saying, “Get the gun, Davey. Davey, get 
the gun...”
Street Fighter
As soon as I heard about it, I had to see 
it. Not that I’m a fan of Jean-Claude Van 
Damme, but I figured that it would be 
cheesy. I was right.
If you know anything at all 
about the video game, then 
you know everything about the 
movie. Van Damme is Col.
Guile, a U.N. soldier on a re­
venge mission for his buddy 
Charlie, who has been kid­
napped by the evil M. Bison 
(played by Raul Julia in his 
last on-screen performance).
Charlie is transformed into a 
green, hulk-like beast, and 
punching and kicking ensues.
The best part about this 
movie is the novelty, but I sup­
pose that’s obvious: it surely 
doesn’t have much of a plot.
All of the “Street Fighter” char­
acters to date make an ap­
pearance in some form or an­
other, with the exception of 
Fei Long. And hey, there’s a 
LOT of punching and kicking!

punching and kicking.
Super Mario Brothers
I haven’t seen this movie in its en­
tirety: however, any film where Dennis 
Hopper portrays a 
lizard-man can’t be 
all bad. Bob 
Hoskins shows up 
as Mario,
Nintendo’s poster 
boy. There’s even a 
stop-motion Yoshi 
for all of you SNES
to rescue the girl (who is apparently 
portrayed by Alyssa Milano) from the 
bad guy (Robert Patrick from Termina­
tor IT).
I don’t know if they fight each other for 
the girl at the end of the movie or not, but 
from what I have seen on the movie 
poster, it looks like a lot of the bad guys 
from the game made it into the film. It 
should be nonstop, whip-crackin’, crate- 
throwin’, baseball bat-whackin’ action!
But Wait, There’s More!

simple. Mortal Kombat, the movie, is

Legends of the Fall
Brad Pitt, whose acting ability has been cred­
ited to the size of his penis, stars in this thriller 
about a young man who falls in love with some 
chick and Anthony Hopkins gets all in a tizzy 
about it. See, this movie is about the idea of 
legends in pre-industrial society or something, 
so there are a lot of woods scenes and things like 
tommy-hawks and guns and water that doesn’t 
have mucous and cigarette butts floating in it.
This was a big hit recently, with Brad appear­
ing in about 50 movies in the past year, includ- 
ing Interview With a Vampire in which he falls in 
love with s ome chick who is 12 year s old and Tom 
Cruise gets all in a tizzy about it. This might be 
pretty swell, if you’re into big chested men with 
little screen presence.

Meg Ryan stars with this guy with a small nose

history and prestige of Albert Einstein: he in­
vented relativity or something and has a brain 
that is in ajar in Minnesota. Now, in this movie 
he gets Meg Ryan and the small nose together in 
order to create a more perfect union, if you catch 
my meaning. The guy with the small nose is a 
mechanic and Ryan is a physicist, and the guy 
with the small nose wants the physicist reeeeeal 
bad so he asks for Einstein’s help. And Einstein 
helps. That’s about the lot of it.
Matthau does well in this one as a German 
scientist and Meg Ryan is a little sticky but

The Undertaker & His

You know? I’m kind of tired of this. There are 
too many B-movies that the whole plot is given 
away in the title. I mean it’s Eke those little 
things in Life In Hell where Abe Groeningmakes 
things up like The Monkey Eaters and the Horse 
That Bit the Witch. I’m all for clarity, but this is 
a bit too much.
So what’s this movie about? The undertaker 
and his pals. There’s your story, there’s your 
plot. There are evil zombies and evil eyes and 
evil fingers and shovels and stuff that are really 
kind of scary and will cause you to fear the biting 
witch. This is the feel-good movie of the year.

The movie is filled with mo­
ments of beautiful idiocy, such as 
Guest’s portrayal of lead guitar­
ist Nigel Tufnel, who plays on 
amps that go up to 11, and be­
lieves that his bones are green, 
since your blood 
looks blue through 
your flesh. The 
whole group, re­
ally, has just done 
so many drugs 
that their minds 
are lost causes, 
with the exception 
of their relatively 
cerebral bassist 
Derek Smalls 
(Shearer), who 
has a habit of 
wearing a cucum­
ber (I won’t bother 
to divulge the 
whereabouts of 
said vegetable),

of normal Hollywood movie-mak- David St. Hubbins, played to per- 
ing policy, creating a spontane- fectionbyMcKean, who has some 
ous production, both 
for the audience and 
the actors. Given its 
experimental nature, 
it seems only proper 
that it would be one of 
the first movies to 
come out with an in­
teractive interface.
For those of you who 
don’t know of this cin­
ematic gem, This is 
Spinal Tap was a 
documentary about a 
fictional British metal 
group called, you 
guessed it, Spinal Tap.
It starred Michael 
McKean (Laverne and 
Shirley), Rob Reiner 
(All in the Family), 
who also directed the 
film, Harry Shearer, and Chris­
topher Guest (both Saturday 
Night Live-ers at the time), and 
was a chronology of what was to 
be Spinal Tap final tour, promot­
ing their latest album, Smell the
dull-minded moments of his own 
(quoth Hubbins of Tufhel’s de­
parture from the group: “Well, 
I’m sure I’d be upset, if I weren’t 
on such heavy sedation.”)
The Spinal Tap CD-ROM works
this way: after an intro screen, press of a button, they can either 
the user is given a viewer, in the play that scene or move on to the 
form of a guitar amplifier, with a next scene that the key words are 
screen in the speaker, and knobs used in. Certain props are in the 
and switches at the bottom to database, as well, such as “cu­
cumber” and “bus.” 
And that’s not all: 
one can also access 
a map of the tour, 
where one can click 
on any of the stops 
to go directly to that 
scene.
But wait, there’s 
more! Spinal Tap 
comes with a bonus 
disc, packed with 
extra footage from 
the film. Because of 
the nature of this 
film’s making, the 
production team 
was working with 
two days of unique 
footage that they whittled down 
to 82 minutes, cutting subplots 
everywhere.
These clips fill in a bunch of 
gaps in the film, and add to the 
hilarity of the piece. The bonus 
disc also has two music videos, a 
commercial for a fictional collec­
tion of the bands music called 
Heavy Metal Memories, and two 
trailers, as well as a bunch of 
stills.
But the real gem is the inclu­
sion of Spinal Tap: The Final 
Tour, the 20-minute film made 
two years before the movie, which 
was used as a demo to land fund­
ing for the feature film.
Spinal Tap gives any Tap fan 
as much information as they could 
ask for with 30 bucks; we learn 
about a lot of the cut subplots, we 
hear the cast and crew’s feelings 
on the movie, and we get to see 
Bruno Kirby sing “All the Way” 
in his underwear. If you’ve got a 
CD-ROM drive, and enjoy the 
multimedia capabilities of the 
hardware, I’d definitely recom­
mend this disc. And, as Nigel 
Tufnel says ofHeavy Metal Memo­
ries, “...it makes a great gift, too, 
doan’ it?”

ANCIENT CHINESE SECRETS
By Ido Ben-Shachar 
and Aaron We is berg
Amazingly enough, it’s almost the end of the 
semester, and things are starting to wind down. 
Very soon, we will be picking this semester’s 
winner of the Golden Tso award.
This award is given to the restau­
rant demonstrating the greatest 
proficiency in preparing General 
Tso’s chicken. In next week’s 
article, we will announce our se­
lection.
If you have any suggestions as 
to who we should select for the 
Golden Tso award, tough. Who 
do you think you are?
This week, we had an excellent 
Chinese experience. It turns out 
that a friend of ours was going to 
Cleveland (for reasons beyond his 
control, of course) and offered us 
a ride. Why would we want to go 
to Cleveland? For the outstand­
ing Chinese food!
At the intersection of Cedar and 
Warrensville in beautiful South 
Euclid, Ohio, there exists a shop­
ping center with FOUR Chinese 
restaurants. One of them is Pe­
king Gourmet, and that is where 
we went.
One notices almost immedi­
ately that Peking is no ordinary 
Chinese restaurant. The decora­
tions are exquisite, the music is 
relaxing, and all the waitresses 
are cute. We were seated imme­
diately at the table normally re­
served for special guests (near 
the electric fireplace). One of the 
things that makes Peking so spe­
cial is that it is run by a wonder­
ful family that takes the time to speak with their 
guests. During our meal, we talked to the 
manager and her daughter. Both were quite 
helpful when we were unsure what to order.
We got General Tso’s chicken, imperial chicken,
orange beef, and happy family. The first 
thing we noticed when our dishes arrived 
was that they looked beautiful, a trademark 
of Peking Gourmet. The second thing we 
noticed was the delicious aroma coming from 
the General Tso’s. It is by far the best Tso’s 
in existence. If it weren’t for the fact that 
this restaurant is in Cleveland, it would be 
a prime candidate for our Golden Tso award. 
Regardless, we enjoyed its delicate bread­
ing, and superb sauce.
The imperial chicken was also delicious. 
It is interesting to note that in China, Gen­
eral Tso’s chicken is prepared much like it is 
here in the United States, except that it is 
less sweet. Thus, we believe that the impe-
GENERAL TSO’S POETRY
Many people do. not realize the sheer talent that General Tso 
possessed. Even fewer realize that he was a very creative man 
outside thè domain of chicken. In doing some intensive research, 
we have managed to dig up some of his more obscure works. Here 
are some “limericks” by the General himself:
Chinese food is really great 
It looks real yummy on my plate 
You eat it and then,
You’re hungry again,
One hour after you ate.
I once had a dinner Chinese.
I ordered beef and snow peas.
My fortune said,
“In an hour you’ll be dead,”
So I asked the waitress, “check please.”
General Tso lived in Peking,
Where his pet chickens would badly sing.
But lightly fried twice,
And sautéed in spice,
They’d hardly utter a thing.
Chopsticks are made out of wood.
In china you never should,
Use them to pick,
Your nose, (cause it’s sick),
And your food won’t taste quite as good.
For now, that’s all the limericks we could find. If you have any 
others, feel free to email them to general@tso.pc.cc.cmu.edu.
rial chicken is a fairly accurate representa­
tion of how Tso’s would be prepared in China. 
(Disclaimer: We have never been to China. 
We have no idea what traditional Chinese 
cooking really is. We could be very wrong.)
The last two dishes, orange beef and 
happy family, were also very good. The 
orange beef was very tender, and the sauce 
was excellent.
We were pleased to find many vegetables 
in happy family, and commend Peking for 
this. In case you have never had happy 
family, it is a delicious blend of vegetables, 
beef, chicken and shrimp, along with the 
General’s special blend of 11 herbs and 
spices.
There is one other little detail about 
Peking Gourmet that we have left out... 
dessertl We can honestly say that Peking’s 
desserts are the most incredible chocolate 
works of art that we have ever had. For 
one thing, all desserts are 
made fresh in house. Our fa­
vorites are the chocolate 
cheese cake and the chocolate 
mousse truffle.
But that’s not all. Peking 
goes well out of their way to 
make their desserts even more 
impressive. They use special 
raspberry and mango sauces 
to decorate the plate on which 
the dessert is placed. They 
actually paint a picture on the 
plate using the sauces, so that 
the dessert does not only taste 
even better, but also looks like 
the work of an artist. You’ll 
just have to trust us; they’re 
incredible.
If you can make it to Oak­
land and back for dinner, 
what’s a few extra hundred 
miles? We left at 4 pm on a 
Tuesday, and got back well 
before lam. For anyone going 
through Cleveland in the fu­
ture, we highly recommend 
Peking Gourmet as a place to 
indulge your wildest Chinese- 
food fantasies. If you don’t 
think we were impressed, then 
just realize that this is a Pitts­
burgh paper reviewing a res­
taurant in Cleveland.
Coincidentally, we give Pe­
king Gourmet 5 out of 5 Tso’s. 
No restaurant has ever come 
even close.
Fortune of the week: “Don’t stand in the 
way of a falling booth.”
And where are we going next week? 
Ancient Chinese secret!
