us,” said William Elliott, vice- 
president of enrollment.
There was nothing subtle 
about 301 of 360 admitted black 
students opting for other institu­
tions this year.
According to Carnegie Mel- 
lon’s admissions statistics, 12 of 
those students chose the Massa­
chusetts Institute of Technology 
(MIT) instead. Stanford Univer­
sity, Duke University, and five 
Ivy League schools were among 
other top student alternatives.
“The financial aid might be 
better at some of these schools. 
We’ll go back and analyze if fi­
nancial aid can be more gener­
ous, but you have to be careful 
there. Giving someone more 
money means someone else is 
getting less,” Elliott said.
The university saw applica­
tions from 940 black applicants 
this year, one of the highest num­
bers in school history. Elliott at­
tributed the increase to Carnegie 
Mellon’s Summer Academy for 
Math and Sciences, a summer 
program geared towards the 
black and Hispanic populations. 
All of the approximately 1000
students that attended the pro­
gram were encouraged to apply 
to Carnegie Mellon. This was a 
change from years past, when 
only certain students were en­
couraged based on their qualifi­
cations.
“Some kids that applied from 
the summer program might have 
been encouraged to apply even 
though they were less than quali­
fied. I can’t prove it.” Elliott said.
The California Institute of 
Technology (Caltech) is an insti­
tution similar to Carnegie Mel­
lon in its focus on mathematics 
and sciences. While it appeared 
to have the largest percentage 
increase in black first-years of 
all top-ranked universities, at 
200 percent, it actually only had 
three black students in its first- 
year class. Caltech was one of 
the smallest of all schools sur­
veyed, with 1.4 percent of the 
entire first-year class composed 
of black students. Last year the 
school had one black student in 
its first-year class.
One of those students chose

Service projects for 
the holiday season
by Eshna Bhaduri
Staffwriter 
& Sabrina Porter
Junior Staffwriter
This holiday season is one of 
service.
Carnegie Mellon students will 
do everything from dressing up 
as Santa’s Helpers to cooking 
spaghetti dinners to participate 
in the service projects open to 
the campus community before 
winter break.
“No one person needs to do 
every project. Deciding what 
you’d like to do and just giving 
what you can is key,” said M. 
Shernell Smith, housefellow of 
New House and the university’s 
community service coordinator.
Toys for Tots
For 19 first-years, deciding 
how to give back involved toys.
Today, students will able to see 
a horse-drawn sleigh on campus 
at noon in front of Hunt Library. 
The sleigh was sent by the U.S. 
Marine Corps to collect the toys 
gathered by students for the an­
nual Toys for Tots fundraising 
drive.
The drive was organized by 
the 19 students of the CIT First- 
Year Advisory Board under the 
leadership of advisor Pamela 
Golubski. For over a month, the 
students have been collecting 
money and toys to donate to the 
Toys for Tots program, which 
will distribute the donations to 
needy Pittsburgh children.
“It feels so good to know that 
we were able to do something 
to help underprivileged child­
ren instead of sitting around 
wishing we could do some­
thing,” said Tracy Ziev, a board 
member and a first-year me­
chanical engineering and phys­
ics major.
“I didn’t think that everyone 
on campus would be so willing 
to donate,” said board member 
Dana Evert-Paraise, a first-year 
chemical and biomedical engi­
neering major. “I went around 
New House and at least 75 
percent of the people gave us 
money.”
Last year, the Toys for Tots 
program distributed 18.5 mil­
lion toys to 7.5 million needy 
children. Local campaigns were 
conducted in 516 communities 
covering all 50. states, the Dis­
trict of Columbia, and Puerto 
Rico.
“This year especially, it is im­
portant for people to donate to 
the cause, as the post office is no 
longer offering collection ser­
vices,” said board member Aman 
Chawla, a first-year mechanical 
and biomedical engineering ma­
jor.
The group has already sur­
passed its $1000 goal, collecting 
over $1100, and has collected 
approximately $500 in toy dona­
tions.
But it is not too late to donate. 
Members of the campus com­
munity can donate money or 
new, unwrapped toys. Gifts and 
donations should be given to the 
Office of Student Development, 
Pamela Golubski in Scaife Hall 
110, or any member of the CIT 
First-Year Advisory Board. Dona­
tions can also be made through 
the program’s official website, 
toysfortots.org.
The Toys for Tots drive will 
continue through Christmas.

For those searching for some­
thing new in the Steel City, 
Google has an answer.
Google officially opened its 
Pittsburgh engineering office, 
Google Pittsburgh, on Novem­
ber 17.
The office is located in the 
lower level of the Collabora­
tive Innovation Center, a four- 
story building built in 2005 to 
provide office and lab space for 
businesses to collaborate with 
Carnegie Mellon. It is located on 
Forbes Avenue, between Ham­
burg Hall and Panther Hollow.
Renovations to the Google of­
fice were completed recently for 
the official opening, but employ­
ees started working in the office 
as early as April 2006. The pur­
pose of the renovations was to 
customize the space to Google’s 
requirements.
“It’s very similar to Google- 
plex,” said Sunny Gettinger, 
a Google spokeswoman, refer­
ring to the company’s world 
headquarters in Mountain View,
Calif. “It’s a very Googley of­
fice.”
The office has an open floor 
plan with many common areas 
and large windows to keep em­
ployees easily accessible to each 
other. Even Andrew Moore, the 
director of the office, works in 
a cubicle like other employees, 
in order to keep in line with the 
Google’s culture of maintaining 
a small-company feel.
Google Pittsburgh employees 
receive a variety of perks, in­
cluding micro-kitchens stocked 
with food and drinks, a reading 
area, and a lounge area with a 
pool table and a flat-panel tele­
vision hooked up to video game 
systems.
Google’s signature exercise 
balls and large bean bags in the 
company’s trademark blue, red, 
yellow, and green are scattered 
throughout the office.
A projected screen in the 
window of the lobby displays 
search queries from the Google 
website. An image generated by 
Google Earth, Google’s virtual 
3-D globe program, is projected 
behind the receptionist’s desk.

Rho Lambda, a leadership and 
honor society for sorority women, 
features individuals in a Women’s 
Leadership Series based on their 
contributions to campus life and 
their achievements as role mod­
els in the Carnegie Mellon and 
greater Pittsburgh communities. 
Marciela DeGrace is the organiza­
tion’s current honoree.
Twenty-one-year-old DeGrace 
is well acquainted with the notion 
that starting small can lead to 
large-scale changes. Through her 
internship studying microbiology 
at the University of Pennsylvania 
and her many contributions to the 
Carnegie Mellon community, she 
has witnessed just how far even 
the most microscopic effort can 
go.
“There are a lot of different
ways to help people,” DeGrace
said. “Even if it’s in a small way,
I can start to make a difference.
Helping in a small way can give 
\
some hope, and that little bit of 
hope is what’s important.”
A senior Hispanic studies and 
biological sciences double major, 
DeGrace is primarily interested 
in studying virology and vac­
cine development with a focus 
on emerging diseases following 
graduation in May. A bilingual 
student who is the Andrew Carn­
egie Scholar for the modern lan­
guages department, DeGrace has 
taken numerous steps to put her 
interdisciplinary knowledge to 
good result. And though the Al­
lentown, Pa., native did not grow 
up speaking Spanish, her studies 
of Hispanic culture have offered 
her a way to maintain her Puerto 
Rican heritage and culture.
Following her summer spent in 
the University of Pennsylvania lab 
researching the West Nile virus, 
DeGrace traveled to Seville, Spain 
the next summer to study abroad. 
There she had the opportunity to 
work in soup kitchens through­
out the gypsy communities. She

Despite dogged efforts by the 
Office of Admissions, diversity 
is down at Carnegie Mellon this 
year.
The Journal of Blacks in Higher 
Education (JBHE) published its 
14th annual survey of first-year 
blacks at the nation’s highest- 
ranked universities and liberal 
arts colleges; Carnegie Mellon 
posted significant declines in 
two population areas.
Carnegie Mellon’s number of 
black first-years declined 25 per­
cent, from 79 to 59 students out 
of 1453 in this year’s first-year 
class. The university is one of 
eight high-ranking universities 
with a decline greater than 10 
percent.
Only 18 percent of black stu­
dents offered admission at Carn­
egie Mellon accepted their offers. 
This statistic — black student 
yield — was lower at Carnegie 
Mellon than at any of its peer in­
stitutions.

Polling talk ends semester; MLK Day begins next
by Liz Schwartz
Production Manager
Before the semester ends, 
the campus will host one last 
speaker, George Crowley, to 
discuss deliberative democracy. 
Then, the first day of classes 
next semester will bring numer­
ous speakers to Carnegie Mellon 
to commemorate Martin Luther 
King Jr. Day.
On Thursday, Crowley, the 
co-director of Carnegie Mellon’s 
Southwestern Pennsylvania 
Program for Deliberative De­
mocracy, will present the last 
lecture of the semester, titled 
“Making Citizen Participation 
Count: Practical Issues in Local 
Deliberative Polling.”
Crowley will evaluate the 
method’s usefulness as a means
of public involvement and pres­
ent the changes that need to 
be made to the deliberative 
process for it to become “a tool 
for strengthening democratic 
accountability,” according to a 
university press release.
Crowley is the author of The 
Politics of Place: Contentious 
Urban Redevelopment in Pitts­
burgh, published in 2005. He is 
also the director of research at 
the Coro Center for Civic Lead­
ership in Pittsburgh. The Coro 
Center aims to motivate young 
leaders to participate in the 
development of the Pittsburgh 
community.
The lecture will take place at 
4:30 p.m. in Baker Hall 150.
Next semester will commence 
with the Martin Luther King Jr. 
Day Celebration on January 15. 
This year’s event features key­
note speaker John Wideman, 
professor of English at Brown 
University. Pittsburgh is Wide- 
man’s hometown and the inspi­
ration for much of his writing.
Wideman is the author of 10 
novels, most recently Two Cit­
ies (1998). He has also written 
several collections of memoirs. 
His work has been published in 
several prestigious publications, 
including Vogue and The New 
York Times Magazine.
Accompanying him will be 
SPIRIT president Rosalyce 
Broadous-Brown, a senior in so­
cial and decision sciences.
Wideman and Broadous- 
Brown will speak together at 5 
p.m. in Rangos Hall.
The day’s events will com­
mence with university President 
Jared L. Cohon’s annual speech 
on the state of diversity at
Carnegie Mellon at 12:30 p.m. 
in McConomy Auditorium.
A panel discussion titled 
“Community Conversation: Op­
portunity. Justice. Pittsburgh? 
Is King’s Vision Relevant in 
2007?” will take place at 2:30 
p.m. in McConomy Auditorium. 
The panel will include Terrance 
Hayes, Carnegie Mellon associ­
ate professor of English. The 
panelists will lead a discussion 
regarding whether King’s ideals 
are a reality in Pittsburgh. Mod­
erating the event will be Everett 
Tademy, Carnegie Mellon’s di­
rector of diversity.
“There’s no doubt that peo­
ple will come and learn some­
thing.... It is an opportunity for 
people to reflect on their own 
ideas and thoughts,” said Anne 
Witchner, assistant dean of Stu­
dent Affairs. Witchner has been
involved in planning the day’s 
events since 1999. She said 
that all of this year’s events “fo­
cus somewhat on issues today 
in Pittsburgh,” but that the day 
was about “paying homage to 
Dr. King... to honor his spirit.”
At 7 p.m., the black graduate 
students of CMU and the Uni­
versity of Pittsburgh will host 
a dinner to discuss the mean­
ing and relevance of King’s 
speeches to young scholars in 
the world today. The discussion 
will be led by a guest speaker 
and a panel of members from 
several organizations for black 
graduate students. The event 
will take place at the McKenna, 
Peter, and Wright rooms in the 
University Center.

It has not set in for me that this is the 
last column I’ll write as Publisher of The 
Tartan. Working as head of this organi­
zation has become a central part of my 
life in the past two years. It’s especially 
strange for me to look back over these 
columns I’ve written. I barely remem­
ber composing the early ones.
Editors at The Tartan are elected to 
terms that last one calendar year, so 
this issue marks the transition period 
between the current and future staffs.
When I stepped into this position af­
ter one of The Tartan’s rockiest times, I 
laid out my hopes for the organization.
“A newspaper provides its readers 
with accurate and reliable informa­
tion they need to make informed deci­
sions in their lives and to be engaged 
members of a community. In this way, 
a newspaper can be a rallying point 
for a community, inspiring construc­
tive discussion and debate that leads to 
great change.”
I felt optimistic and forward-looking 
when I wrote my first column, but I also 
remember feeling uneasy as I wrote 
those words. I believed in them and felt 
like they were what I needed to write, 
but what I wrote felt stodgy or at least 
too abstract.
Senior staff members of The Tartan 
joke that the way to tell who will head 
up the organization is to look for the 
person who has a habit of peeking over 
the shoulders of readers around cam­
pus to see what they’re reading, how 
long they read, and what they do with 
the paper when they’re done. I’ll admit 
it — that was me. It still is.
Having observed the way our readers 
interact with the newspaper over the 
course of two years, I think I’ve figured 
out what I really meant when I wrote 
that first column two years ago.
I’ve heard many thoughtful student 
leaders agree there is a lack of com­
munity and school spirit at Carnegie 
Mellon. I believe that we do have spirit, 
even if it is a brand of our own.
What our community does lack, 
though, is coordination and comm,u- 
nication among the disparate units 
that make up our highly decentralized 
university. We’re fragmented along the 
lines of our majors, among other mech­
anisms of division.
That is where The Tartan comes in. 
Each week, nearly 5000 students, fac­
ulty, and administrators of Carnegie 
Mellon read our newspaper. Each week, 
we try to present the news and opinions 
that we think can bring our community 
together.
I’ve dedicated myself to The Tartan in 
the hope that we could make Carnegie 
Mellon a place where more people felt 
at home. I believe that as more and 
more students across the colleges, stu­
dent organizations, and residence halls 
on campus read the same headlines, 
they’ll feel more connected to each 
other and to Carnegie Mellon.
Two years ago, I was lucky to catch 
a glimpse of someone picking up our 
newspaper; now the . number of issues 
taken each week is much higher. I see 
people reading it anywhere from cam­
pus to the Pittsburgh International 
Airport. And each time The Tartan cov­
ers the hot-button issues on campus, 
we find newspapers left open on lunch 
tables and clippings taped to doors.
To me, the kid who learned early to 
peer over our readers’ shoulders, these 
are the signs of a job well done.
Last week, the staff of The Tartan 
elected the 2007 editorial staff. I have 
every confidence that the incoming 
staff, led by Publisher Shawn Wertz and 
Managing Editor Liz Schwartz, will cre­
ate a newspaper that serves Carnegie 
Mellon better than ever.
To my current and past colleagues, 
thank you. To the future leaders of The 
Tartan, good luck. -

New Google office opens
GOOGLE, from A1
“The office is very bright and 
colorful, and very stimulating. 
It has all of the best amenities ... 
that make Google what it is,” Get- 
tinger said.
Moore, a former Carnegie Mel­
lon professor, is the director of 
Google Pittsburgh. Prior to be­
ing appointed director in Janu­
ary, Moore taught robotics and 
computer science in the School 
of Computer Science.
Google Pittsburgh is working 
on several projects that directly 
involve the software that pow­
ers Google’s search and advertis­
ing business. This includes click 
fraud prevention, which ensures 
that advertisers using Google’s 
advertising services are not 
charged for invalid clicks.
Another project aims to show 
“the right ads at the right time” 
by using artificial intelligence 
to predict the interests of users 
based on their search queries. 
This technology ensures that 
the advertisements displayed 
to users are relevant to their 
searches.
In addition to the office’s con­
tributions to the Google’s search 
and advertising business, Google 
Pittsburgh has a lot to offer to 
the Carnegie Mellon community. 
On Friday mornings, the Google 
Pittsburgh office holds seminars 
to address new research and sci­
entific experiments.
“We have a whole bunch of re­
search seminars open to the CMU
community,” Moore said
The Google Pittsburgh office is 
also sponsoring a program called 
CS for All! The program seeks to 
find new ways to introduce com­
puter science to middle and high 
school students.
“Google’s local office gives us 
an opportunity to expand our 
outreach efforts in the next few 
years to reach many more teach­
ers,” said Tom Cortina, a profes­
sor in SCS. “Plus, they have been 
open to participating with us in 
talking to the teachers about 
computing careers so the teach­
ers can tell their students all the 
exciting things they can do in 
computing careers.”
The office currently has about 
40 employees, but Google plans 
to hire more.
“We’re looking for great peo­
ple,” Gettinger said. “We’ll al­
ways have work for them.”
Currently, more than 50 per­
cent of Google Pittsburgh em­
ployees are Carnegie Mellon 
alumni. The location of Google 
Pittsburgh will help the company 
recruit talent from Carnegie Mel­
lon.
“We are looking for software 
engineers, research scientists, 
statisticians, user interface de­
signers, product managers, and 
engineering managers,” Moore 
said. “In the summer of 2007, 
we are going to have our first 
fully fledged summer internship 
program at Google Pittsburgh. I 
think this will be a high point in 
the Google-CMU relationship.”

Campus News in Brief
Smart People to resume filming on campus tomorrow
The movie Smart People will 
resume filming on campus to­
morrow. As a result, Frew Street 
parking will be affected begin­
ning tonight. Parking on Frew 
will be off-limits after 10 p.m. 
tonight and all day tomorrow,
with an exception for disabled 
drivers. Regular traffic on the 
street will continue. ,
Frew Street is a city parking 
area, and Carnegie Mellon has 
no cpntrol over permits. Ac­
cording to Sophie Nassif in uni-
versity marketing communica­
tions, the film company went 
directly to the city to obtain 
those permits.
For those who are not cam­
pus permit holders, parking is 
available in the East Campus
Garage, on Tech Street, and on 
Schenley Drive.
Additionally, filming will 
take place tomorrow in Hunt 
Library, limiting access to the 
Maggie Murph Café for a few 
hours.
Taskforce leading charge to ban smoking by 2010
The university may take steps 
to prohibit smoking in all cam­
pus buildings by 2010, accord­
ing to a report by the Healthy 
Campus 2010 Task Force. The 
group, composed of 25 students, 
faculty, and staff members, also 
plans to establish designated 
outdoor smoking areas away 
from all university-affiliated 
academic buildings and resi­
dences.
The university’s current 
smoking policy, last updated 
in May 2003, bans smoking 
in campus buildings, shuttles, 
buses, and campus police ve­
hicles. All? university housing 
buildings prohibit smoking ex­
cept two off-campus apartment 
buildings and all Greek hous­
ing. Smoking is also not allowed 
within 20 feet of the entrance 
to any facility or air intake, al­
though there are currently no
repercussions for breaking this 
rule.
The task force has written a 
proposal to change the policy, 
but does not have the author­
ity to revise the policy itself. 
Instead, the group’s hope is that 
the circulation of the proposal 
will stimulate discussion of the 
issue on campus.
“The discussion will hope­
fully have some impact on pol­
icy and social norms related to 
tobacco use on campus,” said 
Anita Barkin, director of Stu­
dent Health Services and chair 
of the task force.
The task force proposes to re­
locate all ashtray holders from 
building entrances to areas 20
- 30 feet away and impose ci­
tations and fines on those who 
smoke outside of the designated 
areas. The actual locations will 
be determined by Environmen-
tal Health & Safety. The group 
also recommends that the cur­
rent policy be modified to state 
that smoking in these areas 
will be prohibited by January
1, 2010, at which point there, 
will be no smoking in all indoor 
and outdoor areas on campus. 
Lastly, the task force wants to 
make all fraternities and sorori­
ties non-smoking.
In addition, the group plans 
to eliminate the sale of ciga­
rettes and smokeless tobacco 
at Entropy beginning in August 
2007. The change will be an ef­
fort to prevent students from 
starting to smoke and promote 
quitting among those "who do 
smoke. To this effect, the task 
force plans to expand health 
education on campus to remind 
students of the health risks as­
sociated with smoking.
The task force has met with
Student Senate, Graduate Stu­
dent Association, Student Dor­
mitory Council, IFC, and Staff 
Council to discuss the proposal. 
They will present the proposal 
at the Faculty Senate meeting 
tomorrow at 4:30 p.m. in the UC 
Connan Room and is open to all 
faculty, staff, and students.
Currently, there are only 29 
colleges and universities nation­
wide that have entirely smoke- 
free campuses, accprding to the 
American Nonsmokers’ Rights 
Foundation. Carnegie Mellon 
is among the list of 191 institu­
tions who have adopted smoke- 
free policies in all residential 
housing, one of eight in Penn­
sylvania.
“Moving to a 100 percent 
smoke-free campus community 
would place Carnegie Mellon in 
the forefront of the movement,” 
Barkin said.
Third annual Summit scheduled for January 11-13
From January 11 to January 
13, 300 students, faculty, and 
staff members will participate 
in the third annual Summit, a 
three-day program in which 
they will attend classes, semi­
nars, and workshops on topics 
in which they are interested but 
don’t have time to pursue dur­
ing the academic year.
“Summit is an extremely 
unique experience,” said Sum­
mit President Sandra Ma, a se­
nior in business administration. 
“Each year, we are constantly 
growing and striving to im­
prove the Summit experience 
for our participants.”
Participants attend a course
in the same subject all three 
mornings of the program, and a 
different class each afternoon. 
New courses this year include 
acrylic painting, Flash anima­
tion, palm reading, and bal­
loon twisting, along with old 
favorites such as culinary arts, 
massage therapy, handwrit­
ing analysis, and glassblowing. 
There are 47 different courses 
currently scheduled, according 
to the program’s website. All 
members of the campus com­
munity are invited to propose 
a course and seek out the nec­
essary materials and instruc­
tors, or create a course to teach 
themselves.
Ma stressed that Summit is 
open to the entire campus com­
munity and attracts students 
from all areas of the university.
“Participants get to meet a 
lot of new people they typically 
would never run into on a nor­
mal basis,” she said.
Summit was founded by Ma’s 
older brother, Roger, who grad­
uated in 2005 with a degree in 
business administration. The 
program ran for the first time 
in January 2005 with 120 par­
ticipants.
Originally a fifth-year schol­
ars project funded by Student 
Affairs, Summit is now working 
towards becoming a financially
independent organization. For 
this reason, the price of the pro­
gram increased to $45 this year, 
up from last year’s fee of $36.
“There is more to college 
than just academics. It’s about 
learning about yourself and 
exploring new opportunities,” 
said Ma. “Everyone should try 
to attend Summit at least once 
before they graduate.”

Black enrollment drops 25 percent
ENROLLMENT, from A1
Caltech over an offer of admis­
sion from Carnegie Mellon.
Columbia University did the 
best of Ivy League institutions 
with blacks constituting 9.4 
percent of the first-year class. 
The University of Pennsylvania 
posted a 26 percent black accep­
tance rate, compared with only 
18 percent for the overall student 
body. This was one of the biggest 
acceptance differentials of all 
participating schools. Nearby 
Swarthmore College in subur­
ban Philadelphia was top-ranked 
among liberal arts colleges, with
11.6 percent of first-years being 
black.
Haverford College, ranked 
second, and Bryn Mawr College, 
ranked seventh, rounded out the 
trio of successful liberal arts col­
leges in this geographic area.
“Those three schools have all 
shown a deep commitment to 
increasing racial diversity. Lo­
cation certainly helps: They can 
get students from Maryland, 
New York, and New Jersey, in 
addition to Pennsylvania,” said
Robert Slater, managing editor 
for JBHE. Slater wrote the black 
enrollment survey article that 
reports on Carnegie Mellon and 
other top institutions’ enrollment 
statistics for his publication’s fall 
2006 issue.
University of North Carolina 
at Chapel Hill led all 30 schools 
surveyed, with a 12 percent black 
first-year class. The Tar Heels 
have earned the distinction of 
highest percentage of black stu­
dents out of the entire first-year 
class six times in eight years.
“They have a lot of kids that 
are graduating from high schools 
in North Carolina,” Slater said. 
He also frequently emphasized 
the role geography plays in the 
college admissions process.
Slater mentioned that this fac­
tor may have also played a signif­
icant role for students choosing 
MIT over Caltech, for the large 
increase in black enrollment at 
liberal arts colleges in the Phila­
delphia suburbs, and for students 
choosing to attend University of 
Maryland.
Four black students offered 
admission to Carnegie Mellon
chose the University of Mary­
land. Statistics for how many stu­
dents admitted to both universi­
ties that chose Carnegie Mellon 
over Maryland for undergradu­
ate studies were not available.
“All of these schools are very 
competitive in their recruitment 
of African-American students. It 
is an intense competition to get 
many of the same kids,” Slater 
said.
Elliott singled out Princeton 
University, the last Ivy League 
school , to begin admitting black 
students (1947), as a particularly 
successful institution this year in 
luring black students with finan­
cial aid. That school declined to 
comment on the grounds of its 
policy to speak only to Princeton 
reporters.
Elliott also noted that the 59 
students that Carnegie Mel­
lon reported to JBHE’s sources 
had been updated to 61. This 
reflected two more black stu­
dents who had not reported be­
ing black on their initial applica­
tion.
Elliott speculated that there 
still could be even more than 61.
Students plan holiday service projects
SERVICES, from A1 
Treasures for Children
Sponsored by the Academic 
Development and Student De­
velopment offices, the Salvation 
Army’s “Treasures for Children” 
is collecting toys for needy neigh­
borhood children.
Until Friday, students can 
stop by the Office of Academic 
Development (Cyert Hall B5) 
or Student Development Office 
(Morewood Gardens) to obtain a 
tag that will provide the gender 
and age of a local child. Students 
who pick up tags should buy a 
$10-$15 gift for the child and re­
turn the unwrapped gift to Stu­
dent Development office.
Rainbow Kitchen
Pi Kappa Alpha brothers have 
been standing outside of Doherty 
Hall dressed in a Santa costume 
to raise money for families that 
need food for the holidays.
Along with the Office of Stu­
dent Development, these “San­
ta’s Helpers” have been working 
with the Rainbow Kitchen to 
provide holiday feast for local 
families. Located in Homestead,
the Rainbow Kitchen works with 
hundreds of needy families year- 
round. They are especially, in 
need of others’ charity during 
the holiday season. More infor­
mation on how to get involved 
can be found at their website 
rainbowkitchen.org.
Spaghetti for cancer research
Last night, the sisters of Delta 
Delta Delta hosted their third 
annual spaghetti dinner to raise 
money. The all-you-can-eat spa­
ghetti cost $5 per student, and 
the money went directly to help 
children with cancer at St. Jude’s 
Children’s Research Hospital. 
Specifically, the proceeds will 
go toward the search for a cure 
to cancer. Those who are inter­
ested in donating to the cause 
can contact Wendy Niedelman 
([wln@) or Jess Jankowitsch 
(jjankowi@) or visit the hospi­
tal’s website, stjude.org.
Day of Service
For students too busy to give 
back before the break, they will 
return to a full day of service on 
the first day of next semester.
Afternoon classes have been
cancelled on January 15 from 
12:30 to 4:30 p.m. in honor of 
the Martin Luther King Jr. Day of 
Service.
Students, faculty, and staff are 
invited to sites on and off campus 
for countless service projects. 
These include sandwich-making 
for the homeless, holiday card- 
making for senior citizens, and a 
mentor program for local school 
children.
The Office of Student Develop­
ment is looking for volunteers to 
serve as mentors to speak to chil­
dren about diversity and integra­
tion in today’s society and lead 
activities honoring King and his 
tradition.
Those who are interested can 
contact M. Shernell Smith (ms- 
smith@, Office of Student De­
velopment), Anna Ly (akly@) or 
Jessica Smith (Jlsl@).
“We are eagerly looking for 
MLK mentors,” Smith said, not­
ing that Student Development 
still needs between 30 and 50 
student volunteers.
For a full listing or more in­
formation on any of the projects, 
students can stop in at the Of­

Leadership Profile: Marciela DeGrace
PROFILE, from A1
then saw first-hand the effects of 
the diseases she studied so 
closely.
“The research I’m interested 
in can stop those diseases from 
becoming an epidemic and stop 
them from becoming a problem,” 
she said.
DeGrace’s college career has 
taught her the meaning of time 
management and, despite the 
stress that may have accompa­
nied the learning process, it’s a 
skill she does not begrudge hav­
ing. In addition to the course load 
that accompanies pursuing a 
double major, she has had to del­
egate time for applying to gradu­
ate school, hoping to return to 
the University of Pennsylvania. 
Her desire to contribute to the 
university has been the driving 
force behind her commitment to 
good planning. Not one to pro­
crastinate, she is disciplined in 
her school work, and often starts 
homework the day it is assigned 
to allow time for her numerous 
other activities.
“Sometimes it’s frustrating
here because you can’t do ev­
erything you want — there just 
isn’t enough time. But I’ve been 
challenged and Carnegie Mellon 
has really prepared me for the 
next step because of how rigor­
ous it is,” DeGrace said. “If I did 
less, I’d be a lot less happy. It’s a 
tradeoff, but I’ve found a way to 
do both [academics and extra- 
curriculars].”
As an active sister of Kappa 
Alpha Theta women’s fraternity, 
she is the activities and service 
chair and the house ritualist, 
as well as a member of the stan­
dards board and the by-laws 
board. Her participation in 
Greek life extends past her house
— she takes part as vice-presi­
dent of recruitment on the Pan- 
Hellenic Executive Board and 
as philanthropy chair for Rho 
Lambda, where she works to 
raise money for Strong Women, 
Strong Girls.
Her leadership skills and am­
bitions to be involved on campus 
reach far outside the Greek com­
munity, however. She has been a 
resident assistant for Resnik Hall 
and is now the community advi­
sor for Roselawn, Woodlawn, 
and Margaret Morrison Apart­
ments. Here, she works closely 
with four RAs and the Student 
Affairs office. DeGrace is both 
a sexual assault advisor and 
Safezone trained. She is also a 
member of Phi Kappa Phi Honors 
Society, Phi Sigma Iota Modern 
Languages Honors Society, and 
the Order of Omega Greek Hon­
ors Society.
Being a leader is something 
that has taught her great humil­
ity, DeGrace said. Her varied 
involvements on and off campus 
have made her recognize the 
responsibility she has to the 
many people who believe in her 
and the work she is capable of 
doing.
“[A leader is] someone who 
has a vision and who works with 
other people to make that vision 
happen,” DeGrace said. “To me, 
you’re not a leader unless you’re 
helping the other people in the 
group realize their potential.”
With her passion for helping 
others, DeGrace is taking action 
every day to make sure she real­
izes her full potential as well.

Science & Technology Editor
Every winter, for a period 
of four weeks, Pittsburgh’s 
electricity output increases 
dramatically. The spike isn’t 
because of a new tech toy being 
widely used, or even because 
people typically heat their 
homes more during this time.
According to Joseph 
Vallarían, the corporate com­
munications representative 
from Duquesne Light, it’s be­
cause of Christmas lights, 
many of which will end up 
being strung on the branches 
of one of the most iconic sym­
bols of the holiday season: the 
Christmas tree.
The Christmas tree has been 
one of the most important sym­
bols in Christian homes, but 
even today the tree transcends 
the boundaries of religion. 
Many people have a Christmas 
tree simply because of the way 
it looks.
The Germans call it Weih- 
nachtsbaum and hide a pickle 
inside of it. The French call it 
sapin de. Noël and originally 
decorated it with paper flowers 
and fruit in the 19th century. 
In any language, the fascina- 
, tion with the Christmas tree 
isn’t necessarily about the ac­
tual tree; it’s about the feelings 
associated with the season that 
the tree elicits.
But choosing the correct tree 
has become somewhat of a sci­
ence today. Prospective buyers 
can select trees in any shape 
and size, and even by authen­
ticity.
Meanwhile, shoppers are 
rarely hard-pressed when try­
ing to find artificial trees; al­
most every department store 
and discount store carries a 
large selection of them.
The debate between artificial 
and actual ensues: Some feel 
that artificial trees are more 
convenient, while others insist 
that living Christmas trees are 
the only way to go. Regardless 
of preference, the affinity many 
people have for these fixtures 
has remained constant.
J-? 4 ° c ¿ir-3 ” ^ 'i ^ '¦ 
Artificial trees evolve
Early artificial trees didn’t 
remotely resemble their conif­
erous counterparts. The trees 
first appeared in the U.S. near
~ j , ¦ ®§K;
the end of the 19th century 
when German immigrants 
brought them over on ships.
They were typically con­
structed with metal wire, and 
then covered with goose, tur­
key, ostrich, or swan feathers. 
In some cases, the feathers 
were dyed green to imitate 
pine needles.
It wasn’t until the 1930s that 
artificial trees began to evolve 
into what they most commonly 
look like today. Thanks to the 
Addis Brush Company, the imi­
tation brush-tree made its way 
into American homes.
Though sold separately, 
Addis trees more than likely 
paired well with the company’s 
toilet brushes that were also in 
use at the time, and the trees 
were actually produced on the 
same machinery as the scrub­
bers.
But today, some artificial 
trees are practically indistin­
guishable from living trees. 
Artificial tree technology has 
greatly improved in the past 
70 years, and most production 
doesn’t occur within the United 
States anymore,
According to the National 
Christmas Tree Associaion, 85 
percent of artificial Christmas 
tree production now occurs 
in China. And last year, over 
150,000 artificial Christmas 
trees were imported into the 
U.S., according to the Interna­
tional Trade Association.
The production is barely 
meeting demand: In the U.S. 
alone, over 42 million artificial 
trees have been bought in the 
past five years.
“Figures for total artificial 
tree use are probably higher 
because artificial trees can be 
used over many years,” said El­
lis Schmidt.
Schmidt, along with his wife 
Joan and son Erich, has been a 
full-time Christmas tree farmer - 
outside of Philadelphia for 
the past 13 years. As a result, 
Schmidt has worked closely 
with the National Christmas 
Tree Association and served on 
the board of the Pennsylvania 
Christmas Tree Growers Asso­
ciation.
Schmidt said that in spite, 
of the popularity of artificial 
trees, sales numbers for living 
Christmas trees have recently 
been growing.
In 2001, approximately 28 
million were sold; four years
later, almost 33 million, were 
sold. J
“Another 33 million are pre­
dicted for this year, but we’ll 
find out for sure after Christ­
mas,” Schmidt said.
Living trees make a return
According to Joan Schmidt, 
part of the reason for increased 
sales is because newer homes 
have higher ceilings.
“There are so many people 
that still want natural trees,” 
she said, “and lately, people 
come in wanting 12- and 14- 
foot trees.”
Currently, the largest ar­
tificial tree offered at Home 
Depot is only 10'6". Those hop­
ing for a larger tree would have 
to purchase a living one. And 
currently, consumers have 11 
different types of living trees 
to choose from.
The largest type of pine tree 
in the U.S. is the white pine, 
which has a bluish-green color. 
Meanwhile, one of the best 
selling varieties is the Douglas- 
fir tree, which even the White 
House purchased this year.
And they’re not alone. With 
.the current demand for real 
Christmas trees, the Schmidts 
find themselves keeping long 
hours at the farm, which cur­
rently has 25 acres of planted 
ground.
“We’re working dawn to 
dark, seven days a week,” said 
Joan Schmidt.
Many farms in Pennsylvania 
are sharing a similar experi­
ence. Pennsylvania currently 
has the largest number of 
Christmas tree farms, total­
ing over 2000. The state also 
harvests the fourth-highest 
amount of living Christmas 
trees each year, with approxi­
mately 1.8 million.
Whether people who cel­
ebrate Christmas will most 
likely get their trees from farm­
ers like the Schmidts or pur­
chase artificial trees at stores 
is debatable. But if you ask Ellis 
Schmidt, he’s hopeful.
“We’ve been gaining 
ground,” Schmidt said.
Official statistics from the 
National Christmas Tree As­
sociation will not be released 
until after Christmas, but if 
current, trends continue, over 
33 million real Christmas trees 
could end up in American 
homes.

Study finds laptops don’t benefit design majors
by Nancy Lee
Staffwriter
Laptop computers are chang­
ing the way students in the 
School of Design interact, ac­
cording to a two-year study by 
Carnegie Mellon University re­
searchers.
Researchers from the universi­
ty’s Office of Technology for Edu­
cation and the Eberly Center for. 
Teaching Excellence conducted 
the study to explore how laptops 
change the way students work, 
and whether they were benefi­
cial or detrimental. Laptops were 
given out to students in typogra­
phy classes for either one semes­
ter or one year.
Students were mostly ob­
served during classes, but they 
were also aske'd to fill out surveys
and logbooks with information 
such as where and how long they 
work and whether they receive 
feedback on their work. There 
were also group discussions at 
the end of the semester that en­
couraged students to share their 
class experiences.
According to the study, stu­
dents with laptops generally 
spend more time on assignments 
and work later into the night than 
those who do not have laptops.
Laptop owners’ time was fre­
quently divided between check­
ing e-mail and instant messag­
ing. They also spent more time 
looking up websites to complete 
their assignments than sketching 
their own work.
This dependency on laptops 
could create problems, according 
to Anne Fay, author of the study 
and director of assessment for
the Eberly Center and the Office 
of Technology for Education.
“Laptops can provide students 
with new creative tools, and re­
sources, adding to their intellec­
tual toolbox of strategies, tech­
niques, and skills,” said Fay in a 
Carnegie Mellon press release. 
“The problem arises, however, 
when students use them as re­
placements for all their other 
tools. Used in this way, laptops 
serve to narrow the range of stu­
dents’ skills, not broaden them.”
It was no surprise to Dan 
Boyarski, the head of the School 
of Design, that students used 
their laptops for other tasks 
while they were working on 
their assignments.
“That’s no different than when 
they’re working on our com­
puters in our lab, because our 
computers are hooked up too,” 
*
Boyarski said.
“So they can be in the middle 
of working and they’re going to 
check their e-mail and get dis­
tracted by something else.” 
However, Boyarski said he 
was surprised that students pre­
ferred working alone at home 
more than working with other 
students because “they didn’t see 
enough value in the interaction 
between themselves.”
“Generally, when they work 
in our lab, they’re working to­
gether. They’re talking to each 
other. They’re asking each 
other for suggestions,” he said. 
“There’s this wonderful learning 
that goes on.”
Students working at home of­
ten received a broader range of 
criticism because they sought 
feedback online from friends 
who were not in design pro­
grams.
Although they recognized 
that working at home supplied 
fewer educational advantages, 
they were still drawn in by the 
comfort of a home environment. 
Laptops may be portable, but 
students rarely worked in places 
other than studio or home.
Introducing laptops into stu­
dio also helped create a very 
different learning environment 
in terms of what could be done 
during class time. Since the lap­
top was in the classroom along 
with the printer, a student could 
have much faster iterations of as­
signments and make changes as 
soon as the instructor provided 
suggestions.
This was a substantial im­
provement from when students 
had to go two floors down to the 
lab in order to make changes, ac-

Cancer linked to 
chicken, baconby Michael M. Whiston
Asst. Science & Technology Editor
Eating bacon at least five times 
a week could increase a person’s 
chances of developing bladder 
cancer by 59 percent, according 
to a recent study. A similar result 
is apparent in individuals who 
eat skinless chicken; their risk is 
52 percent greater.
Harvard scientists used 
136,000 people for their study 
and followed them for 22 years. 
The study concluded that 808 
people of the original sample de­
veloped bladder cancer. Chemi­
cals called nitrosamines and het­
erocyclic amines are thought to 
be the cause.

various well-known corporate- 
logos. The experiment, done» 
by Ludwig-Maximilians Univer-"

that the centers most stimulated; 
were those associated with self-'

positive emotional processing. «
In contrast, lesser-known cor-'-

Good posture could 
lead to a bad back
The familiar refrain “sit up 
straight” might be a severely 
damaging piece of advice. Scien­
tists at the University of Alberta 
have found that the upright posi­
tion associated with good posture 
is actually damaging to the back 
and spine. The common 90 de­
gree position causes potentially 
harmful spinal disc movement as 
the spine strains against gravity.
Researchers found the least 
strenuous sitting position to be 
one where the back is arched at 
135 degrees. It is possible that 
simply sitting at this angle is 
enough to prevent back pain.

Poison removed 
from cottonseeds
For every kilogram of fiber,- 
commercial cotton plants pro-;! 
duce about 1.65 kilograms of; 
seeds. These seeds contain high-; 
quality protein, but they cannot- 
normally be eaten.
Scientists at Texas A&M Uni­
versity have changed that by en-: 
gineering cotton plants to pro-;; 
duce seeds that are missing the; 
poisonous compound gossypol,- 
which had previously rendered 
them inedible.
With the amount of cotton' 
crop currently planted around; 
the world, these modified cot-; 
tonseeds could fill the daily pro-1

Sleep loss paired 
with memory loss
Rats placed in stressful sleep 
deprivation situations were 
found to increase their produc­
tion of corticosterone, a known 
stress hormone. After repeated 
deprivation sessions, the rats’ 
brains decreased their produc­
tion of new brain cells in the hip­
pocampus, which is associated 
with memory.
When placed in similar situ­
ations, rats who had their 
corticosterone-producing glands 
removed showed no change in 
brain cell growth. The results 
lead researchers to conclude 
that stressful sleep deprivation 
impairs brain function, primar­
ily in the memory regions.
Medical Note: Mononucleosis
to show symptoms, while chil­
dren will most likely not exhibit 
symptoms of EBV exposure.
Symptoms typically cease af­
ter two to three weeks of being 
visible, but it can take someone 
who had mononucleosis a couple 
of months to fully regain his or 
her normal energy level. And he 
or she is still capable of spread­
ing the virus to others, even when 
symptoms have stopped. This is 
because the virus can remain in a 
person’s throat permanently, and 
sometimes become active again.
Diagnosis is important because 
mononucleosis is often mistaken 
for strep throat and treated with 
antibiotics.
The downside to this treat­
ment is that antibiotics can ulti­
mately make a person develop a 
rash if he or she is being incor­
rectly treated.
Many of the treatments for 
mononucleosis are things that 
people can do themselves.
Doctors recommend taking 
common painkillers, such as ac­
etaminophen and ibuprofen, to 
take care of a sore throat, fever, 
and headaches.
In contrast, aspirin should 
not be taken while a .person has 
mononocleosis because doctors 
have linked it with a disease 
known as Reye’s Syndrome, 
which attacks the brain and 
liver and can potentially lead to 
death.
But the most important treat­
ment for mononucleosis is rest. 
A person recovering from the 
illness should not participate 
in contact sports or any form of 
heavy lifting for at least three 
weeks after initial diagnosis, or 
until a physician says it is safe.
that don’t involve the activities of 
love-struck individuals include 
sharing eating utensils, tooth­
brushes, and drinking glasses.
The virus is also passed 
through nose and throat mucus, 
as well as tears. And, while rare, 
mononucleosis can be spread 
through transfusion, so those 
with the virus should not donate 
blood.
While symptoms vary and can 
be more severe in people with 
weakened immune systems, the 
most common symptoms of the 
virus include sore throat, fever, 
swollen lymph nodes, a loss of 
appetite, and especially fatigue.
Although many people will be 
infected with EBV by the time 
they reach adulthood, not every­
one will have displayed symp­
toms of mononucleosis. Young 
adults ages 15-24 are most likely

Finals and homework may not 
be the only thing making stu­
dents feel tired this time of year. 
As temperatures fall, students 
spend more time indoors and 
around other people, increasing 
the risk of catching illnesses.
Mononucleosis is one such 
illness. Mononucleosis, com­
monly known as “mono” (and 
sometimes called the “kissing 
disease”), is derived from the 
Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV). It was 
given its more colloquial name 
after being associated with being 
transferred through kissing.
Mononucleosis can be passed 
through any exchange of in­
fected saliva, kissing included.

Milk makes organs 
visible
Barium sulfate, the liquid that 
patients must drink before hav-. 
ing a CT scan, could be replaced; 
by whole milk.
Researchers at St. Luke’s- 
Roosevelt Hospital in New York 
have found that drinking whole: 
milk before the scan has essen­
tially the same effect. Whole, 
milk is. high in fat, which is di­
gested slowly.
The scientists studied 168 pa­
tients scheduled for an outpa­
tient CTscan. Before the scan, 62. 
of them drank about a quart of a 
diluted barium sulfate solution,; 
and the rest drank whole milk.; 
The barium drink distended the' 
small intestine somewhat more 
than the milk, but the definition ^ 
of the intestinal walls was just as; 
clear with milk as with barium. 
A significant benefit is that the 
milk costs $1.39 per patient, 
while the barium sulfate costs

many stop-motion animations, including 
Clash of the Titans and Mighty Joe Young.
Most commonly, metal armature is 
used to support clay figures, but it is also 
used to support the puppets in stop-mo­
tion films. Armature serves basically as a 
skeleton and often includes lead wire for 
the movable parts (like limbs) and brass 
for the unmovable parts (like the chest).
One holiday favorite, Rudolph the Red- 
Nosed Reindeer, used metal armature in­
side its characters. Later, metal armature 
was used inside the were rabbit puppet 
in Wallace and Gromit in The Curse of the 
Were-Rabbit.
Because the Were Rabbit was covered 
in fur, levers had to be placed on the pup­
pet’s back in order to make it move. Had 
the animators touched it, the fur might 
not have looked natural.
However, modeling clay does present 
particular challenges when animating. 
To create a clay animation film you need 
the right clay, a good set of tools, a set of 
figures, and sometimes sets (usually not 
constructed of clay). On his website, ac­
complished animator Vince Backeberg 
recommends a variety of items, like 
stainless steel dental tools, clay sculpting 
tools and hand-made tools from polypro­
pylene plastic. Backeberg worked at Will 
Vinton Productions around the time the 
studio produced the California Raisins 
and the Noid from Domino’s Pizza.
The California Raisins, Gumby, and 
Wallace and Gromit are all brought to 
life with clay. But to create a story show­
ing these characters jumping, playing, or 
running, a person needs a few techniques 
that aren’t normally taught in high school 
art class.
Three-dimensional objects like clay 
forms or metal armature are typically ani­
mated using a process called stop-motion 
animation. This technique requires the 
forms to be filmed one frame at a time. 
Between each frame the animator moves 
the figure very slightly.
Much like flip books that, if flipped fast 
enough, will make the object on the page 
appear to move, stop motion relies on our 
persistence of vision. Our eyes can only 
process new pictures as being single en­
tities up until a certain speed. Once the 
frames of a film or the pages of a flip book 
are changed at a rate too quickly for us 
to process the images as separate, we see 
the frames as connected.
A single stationary object, like Wal­
lace, appears to be moving because we 
cannot distinguish that what we are re­
ally seeing is a series of pictures in which 
Wallace moves slightly each time.
Modeling clay is not the only substance 
used in stop motion animation. The 1933 
version of King Kong also used stop mo-

Teaser portrays sexuality with class
If the rumors are true, coming to Carn­
egie Mellon is the equivalent of throw­
ing away the key to your chastity belt. 
But hey, at Carnegie Mellon we sure can 
program electronics. You could just get 
a new keycard for that chastity belt, and 
so long as you don’t forget the last four 
digits of your Social Security number, 
your V-card’s good to go.
Making fun of Carnegie Mellon’s sex 
culture — shocker. Playboy ranked us 
among the ugliest student bodies, and 
there’s the ubiquitous T-shirt quip, “Sex 
kills. Come to CMU and live forever.” But 
here is something that might surprise 
you: Those rumors are worn out and not 
entirely true. As a society, we have sepa­
rated sex appeal and intelligence, and 
we’re worse off. As a whole, we seem to 
believe that we are either smart or beau­
tiful, but not both. As a campus, we defi­
nitely have a hard time letting the two 
co-exist.
Students here do have sex, but there 
is little public outlet for any sexuality 
or eroticism otherwise. (The eroticism 
ended with the Condom Man presenta­
tion at Orientation.) Other comparable 
schools calm the potential sexiness 
shortage with tasteful art and literature 
magazines where sex is art — titillat­
ing and sensual, but not pornographic. 
Harvard publishes H BOMB, Vassar 
publishes Squirm, Yale Rumpus, and 
Swarthmore / mag (pronounced “bang 
mag”).
H BOMB specifically recognizes that 
Harvard students are busy and also have 
a reputation for, well, never having sex, 
so it appears that Carnegie Mellon is 
not alone in that assumption. Carnegie 
Mellon is more alone, however, in not 
addressing the stereotype publicly, seri­
ously, and tastefully.
Last year WRCT hosted the show Is It 
In Yet? about sex on campus. We wish 
this type of forum for sexual dialogue 
had been able to last more than the year 
it did, as it was an entertaining and 
mature look at a multitude of sex sub- 
topics.
Among the latest attempts to dispel 
the hit-with-an-ugly-stick myth is the 
Teaser Calendar, an entreprenuerial
project started by three sophomores 
that features one beautiful Carnegie 
Mellon woman per month. But a pin-up 
it is not. It is simply a tasteful attempt to 
dispel the rumors that Carnegie Mellon 
girls are less than attractive and show 
that smart and sexy are not mutually 
exclusive. The calendar, professionally 
produced, is meant to be something that 
could be shown to anyone. It is incom­
parable to the low-brow womanizing 
some other campuses go for. (Take, for 
instance, Sacremento State’s “Hornet 
Hotties” calendar, where the cleavage is 
abundant and clothing is minimal.)
The Teaser Calendar was never meant 
to be a pornographic or sexually stimu­
lating product, and it isn’t. We see it 
as a step in the right (read: tasteful) 
direction not only to acknowledging 
the number of beautiful women on this 
campus, but also raising public aware­
ness that it’s okay for sexiness to co-exist 
with intelligence. After all, sexiness and 
intelligence go better together than, say, 
French fries on a salad, and we don’t 
seem to have any problem with that.
Building influence through visibility
When you see a story about a Carn­
egie Mellon student organization on the 
news, it’s not typically for something 
laudable. As the title of one fall 2005 
KDKA broadcast (“CMU showing XXX 
movies on campus”) shows, much of our 
image within the media is steeped in 
controversy. .
While snafus wind up on the nightly 
news, much of the good gets passed 
over. Carnegie Mellon’s chapter of Am­
nesty International recently held a soc­
cer tournament to benefit Doctors With- 
. out Borders, and the organization Circle 
K is entirely dedicated to community 
service. Yet even people who watch the 
local news do not hear about them.
The reality is that no one is going 
to promote student organizations for 
them, and they must take up this charge 
more vociferously lest their good work 
go unnoticed.
It is easy for some organizations to be 
more visible than others: Student pub­
lications such as The Tartan, readme, 
and Big Straw release a distinct prod­
uct regularly and distribute it among 
the community. Lunar Gala produces a 
yearly fashion show that attracts Adam 
Sandler and the average Joe alike. Or­
ganizations that don’t put out a product 
have greater difficulty getting noticed 
by the community.
The way organizations do this is im­
portant. Some ethnic organizations host 
parties that are open to everyone, but 
seem to be lackadaisical when it comes 
to recruiting outside their specific in­
terest group. Other organizations, such 
as Student Dormitory Council, spend 
a great deal of money on things like 
buggy, but skimp on PR. That’s a shame, 
because SDC does some great things on 
campus. Similar organizations should
work to make broader connections and 
therefore gain the respect and interest 
of the community.
And gaining the respect of the com­
munity can go a long way. Leaders of 
organizations should get in contact with 
those who control the flow of informa­
tion. This includes university adminis­
trators, but also other student leaders.
Organizations should establish strong 
identities among the community. While 
charitable events can do this, and al­
ways make people feel good, organi­
zations need to let people know when 
those events are taking place. After the 
events have come to an end, send out 
e-mails to friends and other contacts 
thanking them for the success. Becom­
ing an influential, high-profile, and 
highly respected student organization 
can be difficult, but it’s not impossible, 
and it’s worth it.
A smashingly good season for football
We at The Tartan offer our heartiest 
congratulations to the football team 
for its undefeated regular season and 
awesome postseason performance. The 
Tartans’ systematic thrashing of the 
competition gave us all a reason to get
excited outside the classroom. One day, 
editors at The Tartan actually had to 
make a list of headline verbs to use in 
conjunction with the football Leam. Our 
favorites (most of which never made it 
to print): annihilate, ax, blast, defenes-
trate, destroy, embarrass, eviscerate, 
masticate, obliterate, own, pulverize, 
subjugate, throttle, trample, trash, and 
wreck.
Any way you slice it (or describe it), 
we’re proud of you guys.
Fortune cookies and newsprint: 
three years on The Tartan’s staff
Evan Sundwick
As I contemplate my college experi­
ence up to this point, my eyes fall on the 
fortune I received from a cookie months 
ago, which is now tucked into the frame 
of my computer monitor.
“Do it because you love it.”
I joined The Tartan in my first week as 
a lowly first-year. I had written a couple 
articles for my high school paper, and 
when I showed up at my first news staff 
meeting here at The Tartan, I was terri­
fied of the huge organization filled with 
students much older and more experi­
enced than I was.
I ended up writing what seemed to 
me, at the time, to be a throwaway ar­
ticle about computer viruses spreading 
through the Andrew system. It wasn’t 
too hard — I interviewed a couple peo­
ple and banged out something like 600 
words. However, when the issue hit the 
stands on Monday, there it was right at 
the top of the page. “Above the fold” is 
the proper term, I suppose, and the po­
sition is usually reserved for the most 
important and interesting stories. I was 
in.
Over the next few months I wrote; 
mostly movie reviews and all was fine 
and dandy, but when the time for our an­
nual elections came, I decided to make a 
bid for joining the Editorial Staff. I was 
voted in, and I’ve held a multitude of 
jobs within the organization since then.
This is my final issue as editor-in- 
chief of The Tartan. I have written more 
than 60 pieces over my three and a half 
years at Carnegie Mellon. I have worked 
under four different editors-in-chief, 
met hundreds of people I would have 
otherwise never even said hello to, and
experienced events that I wouldn’t have 
bothered to take note of otherwise.
The Tartan has been my college expe­
rience. I can guarantee that in the years 
ahead, I won’t be able to separate the 
two. I have given up dozens of week­
ends, virtually in their entirety, for the 
newspaper. I have sacrificed my GPA in 
order to better serve The Tartan.
And I wouldn’t trade it for the world.
My time at The Tartan has given me 
opportunities to deal with all sorts of 
crises: interpersonal conflicts, organi­
zational restructuring, public relations, 
staff retention, morale building, bud­
geting, time crunches, and last-minute 
hole-filling — it’s never a dull moment 
in UC 314, and it’s exactly this kind of 
real-world education that no university- 
supplied curriculum can hope to com­
pete with.
I came to Carnegie Mellon as an engi­
neering student. It took me a year, and 
The Tartan, to realize that I wanted to 
write for a living, and I changed my ma­
jor accordingly. As cheesy as it sounds, 
The Tartan helped me discover who 
I was, and that is a gift I will not soon 
forget. Cleaning out my office later this 
month will be one of the last steps in 
one of the most difficult — and reward­
ing — three years of my life.
I’m not leaving the paper, obviously, 
because it’s a great organization with 
tons of talent - and of course, I still love 
to write. However, my final semester 
here at Carnegie Mellon is rapidly ap­
proaching, and it’s time for a new group 
of students to take the helm. I wish the 
best of luck to them all — and I have no 
doubt that our readers will be seeing 
great things from them in the coming 
months and years.

Reflections from an outgoing 
manager on two great years
Tiffany X. Yun
I knew I was going to join The Tartan 
the first day I came to Carnegie Mellon 
University. I worked for two years on my 
high school’s newspaper and wanted to 
continue that experience when I arrived 
in college. The Tartan’s resources and 
reputation attracted me.
I started out at a photographer, but I 
felt significantly disconnected from the 
other staff members. I avoided coming 
into the office unless it was to hand in 
a photo assignment or to pick up a cam­
era. After a semester, I was ready to 
leave because of my lack of attachment 
to the majority of the staff. Little did I 
know, that would have been a big mis­
take.
Social interaction increased under 
new leadership. They planned social 
gatherings and end-of-the-year gala 
events to build team spirit and staff re­
lationships. One year ago, I was elected 
managing editor. Besides enforcing 
deadlines and maintaining an efficient 
and professional work environment, in 
the back of my mind I wished for this 
organization to become a team, rather 
than a group of detached individuals.
As I prepare to leave my position as 
managing editor this semester, I reflect 
on the many moments I’ve had with the 
people in this organization. My third is­
sue in this position happened to be the 
weekend when the Steelers won the 
Super Bowl. Our photographers and 
writers worked full force, gathering in­
formation and taking amazing photos 
of the event. That night, students went 
wild celebrating this victory. And that
morning, until 7 a.m., we fought furi­
ously to incorporate this event into the 
issue set to print that day.
That spring, our former comics edi­
tor, Greg Prichard, and current assis­
tant photo editor, Justin Brown, took up 
the challenge and put together an April 
Fool’s edition called “The Annual Scan­
dal Issue.” It was very well received, 
and I was honored to see the re-launch 
of that tradition with smart, satirical 
content.
I am very satisfied with how much 
The Tartan has grown since I joined 
this organization two years ago. When 
I walk into the office at 2 a.m. on a non­
production day, I always see editors 
there, doing schoolwork, taking care of 
their sections, and enjoying themselves 
in the process. As someone who des­
perately avoided going into the office 
because of the icy environment, seeing 
how vastly this has changed warms my 
heart. I am incredibly happy that be­
yond the weekly 30 hours we spend to­
gether to work on the paper, people are 
still making plans to hang out outside 
the office. My goal to one day see this 
organization not as a come-and-go busi­
ness group but rather a team, a family, 
has happened.
When I ran for this position last year, 
someone asked, “If you didn’t get it, what 
would you do?” I said, “I’d be really sad.” 
Now, I am even sadder that I am leaving 
this position. But The Tartan is in very 
good hands, and I have complete faith 
in our new officers. I hope they have an 
experience as rewarding and breathtak­
ing as mine.
Tiffany X. Yun (txy@) is a junior deci­
sion science major. This is her last issue as 
Managing Editor and she wishes the best 
to all the outgoing officers.

nomenal 19 percent I scored on 
my ninth-grade geometry test. 
The failure was so spectacular 
it actually felt triumphant. My 
friends saw it as subversively 
heroic. “Jenn Kim got a 19 on the 
geometry test. How do you even 
get a 19? That is so phat.” “Phat” 
was the most scandalous thing 
you could be in 1999 Long Island, 
New York. After all, rebellion is a 
trait of valor in the eyes of ado­
lescents. With a 19 on the test, 
I proudly flew the “I don’t give 
a shit” flag to impress peers and 
got a week’s worth of classroom 
attention. There is. something 
dark, romantic, and even sexy 
about failure.
Success is universally admired 
and, unlike failure, you get your 
money’s worth, when you’re still 
breathing and around to enjoy it. 
But success can be just as dark as 
failure: Matthew Perry had his 
intoxicated Porsche accidents, 
Dick Cheney had his 287 heart 
attacks, and Paris Hilton, the 
Olsen sisters, and Lindsay Lohan 
apparently share their men.
When I was a kid, in response 
to my parents’ enthusiastic mis­
understanding of me, I aspired 
to become something so undeni­
ably unique and renowned, so 
sublime and awesome that my 
parents would be a joke. I would 
be a female rock star!
I was in love with British pop 
and modern rock. The listening 
part kind of got boring after a 
while, and I wanted to take part 
in the genre. And after years of 
lessons and countless hours of 
playing guitar instead of doing 
my homework, I became the 
world’s most average guitar play­
er and the world’s most out-of- 
tune vocalist. Yeah, I had my own 
punk band in 10th grade, and 
for three weeks I sang in a hid­
eously Korean/American/British 
accent. It was painfully clear that 
I would never be a lady Beatle, 
nor a madam Pistol, let alone an 
Avril Lavigne. (She’s not part of 
Brit pop, by the way.)
Still, I thought there must be
something else I could excel in, 
that could make me an irrefut­
able success. There it was staring 
at me from the television, every 
night at eight o’clock sharp: I’d 
become a famous anchorwoman, 
like Connie Chung! In Korea!
Think of it: All I would have 
to do is read and people would 
watch me every day if they want­
ed to keep in touch with the rest 
of the world. They would adore 
me and respect me. Every word 
out of my mouth would carry 
such credibility. I would be rich, 
but everyone would give me 
everything I wanted for free. It 
seemed to be the most clever 
pathway to success yet.
I got a bit further pursuing 
this dream than becoming a rock
star. I worked as an intern for 
a summer at perhaps the most- 
watched national news station 
in South- Korea — the eight 
o’clock news on KBS, the Korean 
Broadcasting System. I,received a 
delightful, hands-on experience, 
following reporters around and 
helping out with the busy-work 
at the news station. It seemed so 
simple and easy; I wondered why 
everyone in the world did not 
also want to be a famous anchor­
woman. And then I realized that 
everyone in Korea does want 
to. I attended a panel at Ewha 
Women’s University (the most 
highly respected women’s col­
lege in the country) for students 
wishing to advance in journal­
ism after graduation. I saw about
5000 young women of my age, 
all beautiful, intelligent, and aca­
demically successful, crammed 
into a rather large auditorium on 
campus. I instantly became aware 
of my weaknesses: most promi­
nently my weird “American” 
accent when speaking Korean 
and my noticeably small Korean 
vocabulary.
I was at a crossroads. I could 
give up my dreams of success and 
greatness and become that noble 
failure — dabble in drugs and 
cultivate an aggressive alcohol­
ism — or, I could turn to the very

average!
You may be saying to your­
selves that this is all just a shame­

you feel sorry for me. I can’t 
help it. I’m mediocre! From now 
on, my sole recourse is to find 
peace in mediocrity. To embrace 
my tepid fate for all it’s worth. 
Let’s face it, most of the world 
is mediocre and they don’t seem 
to mind. This is America. We’ve 
made mediocrity an art form 
here. We take cinema and turn

first passion that I had had ever 
since I could scribble the alpha­
bet. Writing! Why not? I could 
spend hours just writing away 
about the complexities about 
life, death, emotions, and rela­
tionships, the daily endeavors, 
and nightly fantasies. I’m short, 
dramatic, sentimental, and Asian 
— why, I might as well become 
the next Amy Tan.
Yet, I was as far from success as 
I ever was. I strove to write more 
vividly, inspirationally, beauti­
fully, perfectly! But my grades 
don’t quite meet my parents’ or 
my own standards. I have never 
received any awards for my 
writing. However, I’m also not an 
utter failure. No, I’m something 
much, much worse. I am medio­
cre. Success is great, and there 
seems to be some type of nobil­
ity in failure. But mediocrity is 
quicksand. All my life I feared it.

I couldn’t ironically succeed at 
being mediocre? Perhaps, I have 
finally found something I can 
genuinely excel in.

One semester down, one to go. 
Winter break is upon us. We’re 
looking forward to a productive 
spring semester as well. Before 
we give you a sense of where 
we’re going, we’d like to show 
you where we’ve been.
Gender-Neutral Housing
Throughout the fall semes­
ter, we’ve been meeting with 
housefellows, Student Affairs, 
Housing, Michael Murphy, Jared 
Cohon, SDC, and Senate to help 
solidify a gender-neutral housing 
pilot-study. The study will focus 
on apartment-style livjng and 
would allow students to easily 
share coed living spaces without 
impacting students who want to 
live in a same-sex living environ­
ment. We’re hoping to pilot the 
program this coming room draw.
CampusWiki
Carnegie Mellon students know 
a lot about this campus and how 
to maximize our college experi­
ence. That information needs to 
be shared. Next semester we’ll be 
rolling out a CampusWiki so that 
the entire community can share 
its knowledge.
Carnegie Skills Workshop
In pursuit of not wasting 
our time more than we have 
to, we are trying to help along 
this historically innovative and 
responsive course to recognize 
what’s needed. Evan Osheroff, 
the Student Senate Academic 
Affairs chair, has been working 
with us to develop new possi­
bilities for the CSW curriculum. 
We have commitment from the 
CSW Committee to make chang­
es where needed after a study in 
the spring.
Tutoring
This semester we investigated 
the problems with cutbacks in 
free tutoring, why tutoring is 
needed, how we utilize it, and 
why the money is falling short. 
We found funds which we can 
use to increase the bottom line. 
Next semester, we’ll look into 
long-term strategies to invest in 
tutoring so that hard-worlpng 
students won’t fail.
Tent covers
It sucks to table in the rain or 
when it’s really hot. We’ll be pur­
chasing tent covers for students 
to use when tabling outdoors. 
These shaded atriums will make 
tabling easier and more enjoy­
able.
That’s just a hint of what we’ve 
been working on and where we’ll 
be going next semester. Our 
agenda isn’t set in stone, nor is it 
something that only we can con­
tribute to. Want to cause some 
positive change? Contact us!

Gators look to defend title in 2006-07 college basketball season
Doug Fricker
College basketball is back 
and it’s picking up where it 
left off last April. Now almost 
a month into the season, the 
stage has been set for an excit­
ing few months leading up to 
the madness in March known as 
the College Basketball Tourna­
ment.
Here’s your brief guide to the 
game’s top teams, top players, 
and the big stories to monitor 
throughout the season.
The Florida Gators come into 
the season as the defending 
champions, returning all five 
starters from a year ago. The 
Gators should actually be bet­
ter than they were a year ago, 
which is a scary thought for 
their competition.
As we see every year, any­
thing can happen come March, 
but on paper, Florida has the 
best shot to bring home the 
championship.
The UCLA Bruins lost to 
Florida in last season’s cham­
pionship game and they’ve had 
to replace three starters. De­
spite this, UCLA is returning 
many talented and experienced 
players including Pac-10 Player 
of the Year candidate Arron 
Afflalo and Josh Shipp, who 
missed the majority of last sea­
son due to a hip injury. Shipp 
is healthy now, and as long as 
Darren Collison can be a solid 
point guard, the Bruins will be 
primed for a successful season.
The Pitt Panthers, behind 
Big East preseason Player of 
the Year Aaron Gray, should be 
able to fill the void left from the 
graduation of Carl Krauser and 
have one of their best seasons in 
recent history.
Gray will cause problems 
in the paint for opponents all 
season and transfer Mike Cook 
has already stepped in and pro­
duced. Add in their depth and 
experience and Pitt will be a 
dangerous team.
The Ohio State Buckeyes 
brought in possibly the best re­
cruiting class in the history of 
college basketball headlined by 
future NBA number-one pick 
Greg Oden.
The new rule that doesn’t al­
low high school players to go
directly into the NBA benefited 
OSU greatly.
Oden and the four other new­
comers that make up the “Thad 
Five” (named after Buckeyes 
head coach Thad Matta), com­
bined with some solid returners 
make the Buckeyes the favorite 
in the Big 10.
Oden made his debut Sat­
urday and he’s the real deal. 
OSU could be the first school 
in history to win the college 
football and college basketball 
championships in the same 
year.
The Kansas Jayhawks won 
the Big 12 conference last year 
with three freshmen and two 
sophomores in their starting 
lineup. These five players, led 
by Brandon Rush, are all a year 
older and hungry to avenge 
their early exits from the tour­
ney the past two years. They al­
ready proved they can beat the 
best, as they defeated Florida 
over Thanksgiving weekend.
Last but not least are the 
North Carolina Tar Heels. UNC 
has stockpiled talent the past 
two years to replace the top 
players on their 2005 champi­
onship team. Tyler Hansbrough 
leads a Tar Heels team that is 
starting three top-notch fresh­
men.
UNC has so much talent on 
this team that their last guy off 
the bench would start on most 
other teams.
The National Player of the 
Year is up in the air with no 
clear-cut favorite. UNC’s Hans­
brough (the preseason ACC 
Player of the Year) is a front run­
ner along with Pitt’s Gray and 
Florida’s Joakim Noah, who was 
the MVP of last year’s champion­
ship game. Wisconsin’s Alando 
Tucker has All-American poten­
tial as does LSU’s Glen Davis, 
nicknamed “Baby Bull” and 
Marquette’s Dominic James, 
who poured in 25 points in their 
win at Duke a few weeks ago.
The season’s just begun but 
we’ve already witnessed some 
great games and events that 
will factor into which teams in 
March make the tournament 
and which don’t.
Teams from mid-major con­
ferences, that typically aren’t 
expected to compete with the 
teams from the traditional six
power conferences, are sud­
denly creating more parity in 
the game by defeating those 
teams.
The Horizon League’s Butler 
(ranked 19th) is 9-0, having 
won the preseason NIT and 
already having wins against 
Illinois, Indiana, Tennessee, 
and Gonzaga.
The Missouri Valley Confer­
ence’s Wichita State (ranked 
17th) is 6-0, with wins over 
sixth-ranked LSU and 15th- 
ranked Syracuse. We saw these 
mid-major teams make a dent 
in our tournament brackets 
last March (remember George 
Mason) and they’re continuing 
their success into this season.
Expect the unexpected this 
season but look for the six teams 
mentioned above to make runs 
deep into the National Tourna­
ment with North Carolina and 
Florida meeting in the champi­
onship game due to both team’s 
sheer talent and great coaching. 
Florida, having experience on 
its side, is a good bet to hold off 
North Carolina and win its sec­
ond national championship in a 
row.
Basketball loses at home
BASKETBALL, from A12
throw with two seconds remain­
ing.
Matta, in a gutsy perfor­
mance, led Carnegie Mellon with 
13 points and Einwag added 12 
points, going eight of 14 from 
the free-throw line. Sophomore 
center Rob Pearson led the team 
with eight rebounds.
“This group is fun to be in prac­
tice with,” Wingen said. “Their 
enthusiasm is tremendous. We’re 
getting great leadership from 
Brad Matta and Greg Gonzalez.
They’re even enthusiastic about 
defensive slide drills. They’re 
very coachable and a lot of fun 
to work with. We’ve made great 
strides since the first day of prac­
tice, and in spite of the fact that 
we’ve lost the last two games, 
we’ve lost to very good teams. I 
think we’re growing and improv­
ing every day and we’re going to 
be playing our best basketball at 
the end of the season.”
The Tartans will be in action 
again tonight when they host La 
Roche College at Skibo Gymna­
sium at 7:30 p.m.

the Franklin & Marshall College 
tournament/ Since then, the 
team has had wins over Thiel 
College and Waynesburg Col­
lege.
This week, The Tartan sat 
down with sophomore forward 
Colleen Light to talk about 
her success and the basketball 
team’s season.
Tartan: How old were you 
when you started playing bas­
ketball?
Light: I was about five or six. 
My parents signed me up for a 
youth recreational league one 
day and I just fell in love with 
it.
T: Did you always plan on 
playing basketball in college?
L: Yeah, pretty much. It was 
something I wanted to do, and 
then coming to Carnegie Mel­
lon gave me a good balance of 
academics and basketball.
T: How do you handle Carne­
gie Mellon’s academic load and 
basketball?
L: It’s really just time man­
agement. It gets a little crazy 
sometimes, but pretty much just 
focusing on what needs to get 
done and managing time well.
T: Do you have any pre-game 
rituals or superstitions?
L: Nothing in particular, but 
I have to do the same things 
before a game, the same drills, 
work on the same shots, and go 
through all the same stretches 
in the same order.
T: What do you focus on 
during a game to stay competi­
tive?
L: I really focus on winning, 
just staying in the game, and 
what to do to try and make sure 
we win. I really hate losing, so I 
want to do everything I can to 
make sure we don’t.
T: Any accomplishments you 
are particularly proud of?
L: I was really excited to get 
tournament MVP [at the Terry 
Greene Tip Off Classic], we all 
played really well, but recogni­
tion is always nice.
T: Do you have a favorite place 
that you and the team have got­
ten to travel to?
L: When we go to New York 
to play New York University. I’m 
from New Jersey, so my fam­
ily comes, and it’s nice to get to 
see them and have them there 
to watch me play. Plus the city
ter picked up some speed, and 
gained an eight-point lead at 
20-12.
First-year guard Paige Wil­
liamson and Rothwell boosted 
Carnegie Mellon’s morale by 
scoring two foul shots each, fol­
lowed by a steal and lay-up from 
Aleski, and a three-pointer from 
senior guard Nora Darcher that 
brought the Tartans the lead 
21-20. At halftime, the score 
was 36-34 in the Tartans’ favor.
Rochester came out strong in 
the second half and by the 10th 
minute had a 15-point advan­
tage. The Tartans lagged behind 
for the rest of the second half 
and were unable to pull through 
with a victory.
“We felt confident in our 
abilities going into the game,” 
Williamson said. “There was no 
doubt in our minds that we could 
win but we came out and missed 
a couple of shots that we could 
have made, otherwise we could 
have easily won. We were not in­
timidated.”
Rothwell once again led the 
Tartans with 22 points and 12 
rebounds. Light added 17 points 
and Aleski had seven points 
and five assists throughout the 
game.
The Tartans will play next at 
Washington & Jefferson College 
in Washington,,Pa., on Tuesday. 
Tipoff is scheduled for 7 p.m.
“Starting the UAA off with 
Rochester just gave us a pre­
view of the tough competition 
in the conference and allowed 
us to realize that we need to be 
stronger and a consistent offen­
sive threat,” Feola said. “As far 
as W& J, we are just going to play 
our game and we’ll be success­
ful.”
is always fun and there’s lots to 
do.
T: Do you have any favorite 
things to do here at Carnegie 
Mellon when you have some 
time to kick back and relax?
L: Pretty much just that. Kick 
back, relax, watch some TV, 
hang out with my friends, and 
sleep. Usually sleep. Sleep’s a 
big favorite.
T: Any game in particular you 
are looking forward to?
L: Definitely the game against 
New York University. We play 
them in New York, so that will 
be a nice trip, but they’re also 
sort of our rivals, so it’s a big 
game. It’ll be fun and pretty 
competitive.
T: Are you brave enough to 
make any predictions for the 
women’s basketball season?
L: I’d like to, and I think I 
could, but I don’t want to say 
them aloud and jinx it.
T: Okay, how about goals for 
the season?
L: Definitely a winning sea­
son, playing good games, and 
having a solid finish to the sea­
son.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team lost 60-51 to 
the University of Rochester Yel- 
lowjackets on Saturday in the 
University Athletic Association 
(UAA) opener for both teams. 
Rochester (5-1, 1-0) won the 
UAA title two years ago by 
defeating Carnegie Mellon (3-2, 
0-1) on the final day of the regu­
lar season, but last year Carn-
jackets. He collected 21 points 
and 15 rebounds, despite only 
shooting three of 12 from the 
free-throw line. The Tartans 
had chances to cut Rochester’s 
lead but they struggled from the 
free throw line down the stretch, 
making only six of their last 15 
attempts.
“This was a typical hard- 
fought UAA game,” Carnegie 
Mellon head coach Tony Win- 
gen said. “There’s nobody in 
our league that doesn’t think 
the UAA is the best basketball

Copious cookies
Lawrenceville hosts International Cookie Festival
Along with the holly branches, mistletoe, and 
ornaments that adorn halls and hearths of 
families during Christmas time, there are the 
treats. Popcorn balls, peanut brittle, and egg 
nog can all be found both on the tables and in 
our bellies at Christmas, but most important are 
the cookies. While other treats are delightful, 
few are as iconic as the Christmas cookie. A 
cookie, unlik^a chunk of brittle or a spiked 
beverage, can be shaped into the form of a tree, 
a snowman, a star, or a candy cane. And where 
would Santa be if he had just a glass of milk?
One of the most interesting facts about 
Christmas or holiday cookies is that they are 
represented throughout the world. For example, 
in Bavaria and Austria, anise-flavored spingerle 
cookies are the traditional holiday cookies 
because the springerle are stamped with holiday- 
themed pictures like reindeer. The Neapolitans 
have an S-shaped cookie called susamielli, which 
is covered with sesame seeds.
No matter how you celebrate the holidays, 
cookies can add a bit of cheer, and for one 
neighborhood of Pittsburgh they add customers 
to the local businesses as well. Each year 
businesses from the 16:62 Design Zone and other 
Lawrenceville shops feature a cookie during the 
holiday season and attempt to attract shoppers 
inside for cookies in the hopes that they will 
leave with more. The cookie tour, once called the 
Joy of Cookies Tour, was renamed this year as 
the International Cookie Festival. Sixteen shops 
featured a cookie from around the world. Beside 
each shop’s cookies were small white recipe 
cards intended to perhaps inspire international 
cookies to pop up all over Pittsburgh.
The cookie tour was started by Jay Bernard, 
proprietor of Jay Design Soap and Gifts at 4603 
Butler St. At Jay Design, shoppers bustled 
through the small store. Though the smell was 
sweet inside, it was more from the soaps than
from the cookies, which were hidden away 
from view and required some investigation to 
discover. A variety of cookies was displayed, and 
without a recipe card it was a challenge to tell 
what country might have provided the spread.
Mary Coleman, owner of the Gallery on 43rd 
Street, initiated the idea of expanding the cookie 
tour event to include international cookies.
"[The tour] grew and expanded to reflect the 
neighborhood," Coleman said, explaining that 
part of the goal of this year’s tour was to include 
“new businesses and other businesses who 
hadn’t participated, and to make it new for those 
of us who do it all the time.”
The Gallery on 43rd Street featured Spanish 
churros and offered coffee to patrons. Another 
special part of the Gallery on 43rd at Christmas 
is the calligraphy artist employed to personalize 
Christmas ornaments. Woolen winter scarves, 
ornaments, and choir angels are all among the 
gifts featured at the Gallery on 43rd.
Other cookie stops included Salon 22, a hair 
salon that was kindly giving out Russian tea 
cookies along with hair product samples. At 
Picturesque Photography and Gifts, the Chinese 
almond cookies were much less plentiful than 
the portrait examples that owner Brenda Knoll 
offers. Customers can bring in photos or have 
photos taken and made into keepsakes, T- 
shirts, necklaces, or just framed pictures. “For 
me this is pure advertisement,” said Knoll of 
the International Cookie Festival. "I’m different 
than the other shops, since I’m a custom 
manufacturer. During the cookie tour, people 
come in and get ideas."

The Tartan congratulated the men who built the 
dam behind campus. Those involved were to be 
paid in their enjoyment in helping out, but that only 
went so far. Their hard labor better should have 
been reinforced with a hefty holiday bonus; we’re 
surprised they weren’t dam broke.
Among the four advertisements for cigarettes in 
The Tartan that week, Chesterfield’s ad depicted 
a chipper young lad discussing his satisfaction. 
The character boasted, “Everything looks bright 
with your Chesterfield alight!” (Except for his teeth.) 
The cigarette ad continued, stating that, if you 
“like your pleasure big,” then you should smoke 
Chesterfields. That’s what she said.
The Tartan offered some tips for staying sane 
during finals week. The advice included thinking 
not of what one must learn, but of what one has 
learned already. The article also suggested that 
students could limit their stress by listening to 
music and sleeping. Students are urged not to 
forget that others’ stress-reducing habits might be 
different than their own. So to sum up: Don’t lash 
out when your neighbors cope with their anxieties 
by having a disco at 3 a.m.
After years of waiting, Carnegie Mellon students 
finally got online access to the Hub. Instead of 
waiting in line to schedule classes at the Hub, 
students were now able to register online for their 
classes. This new system proved to be more user- 
friendly.
Headlines in The Natrat, The Tartan’s parody 
newspaper, included: “Prostitution discovered 
at University Frat House,” “CMU Murderer at 
Large; Police Unconcerned,” and an editorial 
titled “My Scooter is Gone.” Some articles may 
be surprisingly taken as truth, such as “Computer 
Science Students Like New Wean Dorm Idea."
Carnegie Mellon was an exception to the national 
trend, because it was still able to draw students 
from abroad while many other schools’ numbers 
were on the decline. An article reported that the 
enrollment of international students is stilt strong 
at the university. We have students from other 
countries? I hadn’t noticed.

Pittsburgh Symphony premieres new piece
Feast During a Plague challenges listeners
This weekend, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra was 
joined by superstar violinist Joshua Bell in Brahms' violin 
concerto. High school girls, their hearts beating heavily, 
came in droves to see (not perhaps as much to hear) Bell 
play and meet him after the concert. But before hearing Bell 
play during the second half of the concert, the audience was 
subjected to, nay, tricked into, listening to... modem music!
The PSO premiered Sofia Gubaidulina's Feast During a 
Plague, which had been commissioned by both the PSO and 
the Philadelphia Orchestra; Sir Simon Rattle conducted the 
Philadelphia premiere last year. Gubaidulina, 75, had planned 
to come to the Pittsburgh performance, but was unable to do 
so after the death of her husband.
Gubaidulina was bom in 1931 in the Tatar Republic, still a 
part of the Soviet Union. She was very interested in folk music 
and co-founded the Astreia ensemble. She has written music 
for the bayan, a Russian accordion. Although Gubaidulina 
is very well known in Russia and Europe, she is not as well 
known in the United States. She is well represented by 
recordings: Gergiev, Dutoit (with the Boston Symphony 
Orchestra), Kremer, Rostropovich, and the Kronos Quartet 
have all performed and recorded her music.
Gubaidulina’s piece is a prime example of modem music.
Big Al’s Metal
A metalhead’s holiday wish list
Pittsburgh is a metal town, if you haven’t noticed by now. In 
the last month, we have been graced with many outstanding 
bills, from the triple threat of Soilwork, Mnemic, and Threat 
Signals at the Rex Theater to the stellar Paul Stanley rocking 
Greensburg the day after Halloween. Want more, you say? 
How about the meat-and-potatoes rock of Soil and Shinedown 
as they opened for Godsmack last Saturday? If you missed it, 
don't worry — interviews, reviews, and the whole deal are 
coming your way soon enough. And while some trudge home 
after a semester of no sleep and a belly full of noodles, those 
remaining will continue the rock with Killswitch Engage and 
Hatebreed on December 13 and Clutch and The Sword on 
December 27th, both at Mr. Small's in Millvale. For all the gifts 
that the local scene is giving us in the coming weeks, though, 
we must take a look at the holiday season upon us. Here's a 
few ideas for the metalhead in your family:
Iron Maiden’s A Matter of Life and Death: Maiden's 
latest follows nicely on the path set by its two post-reunion 
releases. Rarely does a band like this get better with age as 
far as songwriting goes, but Maiden of course defies any sort 
of critical review. A stuffy magazine like Rolling Stone can call 
this album a more "mature” outing, but I simply say bollocks 
to that. Part prog, part power-metal, the Maidenites of this 
world have a gem that sits well beside their re-re-reissue of 
Piece of Mind. That’s good. Up the Irons!
Manowar’s DVD The Day The Earth Shook — The 
Absolute Power. Perhaps the irony of loin-clothed
The piece was very dissonant at times, used many modem 
techniques of playing instruments, and had a large arsenal 
of percussion. Gubaidulina is a master of orchestration; she 
often uses a huge orchestra to produce a dizzying palette of 
colors.
Gubaidulina drew her inspiration from one of Pushkin's 1830 
Little Tragedies, called A Feast During the Plague. Pushkin 
in turn drew inspiration from an 1816 poem by John Wilson, 
“The City of the Plague." Pushkin's poem is rich in imagery, 
illustrating the insanity of celebrating a feast during a plague 
that is ripping apart a city.
Gubaidulina’s piece is a metaphor for, as she has said, “the 
calamity overtaking mankind, the lowering of the moral level 
of society,” and many people’s indifference to it. Like Pushkin 
and Wilson, Gubaidulina was able to create imagery that is 
both evocative and disturbing.
One of the most interesting parts of the 25-minute work 
occurred near the middle. The orchestra was playing quietly 
and pensively when, from out of nowhere, a selection of 
techno music started blasting, covering up the orchestra for 
a few seconds. The orchestra continued, building up, and the 
techno music returned in spurts.
American metal warriors bringing the Viking thunder is lost 
on their rabid European fans. Perhaps that is the point. Who 
knows? All I can truly say is that these men rock, and hard. 
Proclaimed by the Guinness Book of World Records in the 
'80s as the loudest band on Earth, Manowar is also a group 
of consummate musicians. All of this creates a package that 
fans will follow to hell and back, which is documented on this 
DVD. Worth checking out even if you’ve never heard of them.
Children Of Bodom's Chaos Ridden Years — Stockholm 
Knockout Live: Once the wunderkinds of our scene, now all 
grown up and touring with Slayer, this disc perfectly (almost 
too perfectly) captures them at their best live. Nice packaging 
too. All thè hits, live and louder than ever.
Paul Stanley's Live To Win: As I mentioned earlier, Stanley 
played these parts a month ago, and it was worth every penny
I paid to see him. Opening with "Live to Win," the title track 
off his latest solo album, the show lasted way into the night 
with many Kiss favorites played. "Strutter" was the highlight 
for me, but this solo album is surprisingly... good. As the odds 
of a new Kiss record get slimmer with time (unlike me), this 
could be it for new material. In any case, check it out and 
buy it for anyone you know who even moderately likes music. 
Chances are there is a closet Kiss fan in your family. At the 
show I ran into everyone, from a cop from Buffalo who brings 
his beautiful wife and kids to anything Kiss-related across the 
country, to the young ladies from the Midwest who got turned 
onto Gene-Paul-Peter-Ace as kids by their older brother-sister-
The use of techno music was quite an interruption. It was a 
powerful tactic, especially for young people who have danced 
to similar music in clubs and at parties and connected with it 
before. Gubaidulina’s juxtaposition of very serious music and 
heavy techno music comments on how perverse it might be 
to dance and party during a plague.
Gubaidulina’s piece, though very modem in its techniques, 
conveyed strong emotions. Sitting in a comfortable seat in 
Heinz Hall, the music very strongly sounds like a warning
— one could feel its proximity, as if it were approaching from 
just beyond the horizon.
Near the end of the piece, the loudest and most intense 
climax ends suddenly, leaving just strings playing sustained 
notes very quietly. Then, various drums brutally hammer out a 
rhythmic motif that had appeared earlier in the piece.
The PSO often plays modem music and commissions 
composers to write new music. Premieres are special, one-of- 
a-kind experiences, and it is a privilege to be a member of the 
first audience to hear a new work.

Jay-Z returns from ‘retirement’ with Kingdom Come b&mm&yJon Joanna Newsom’s Vs' radio station
His album cover is an eerie shade of red. The collar 
on his jacket is popped. His hat is tipped to the side, 
revealing a New York Yankees logo. The “PARENTAL 
ADVISORY" sticker is slapped on the corner. His look is 
ambitious, eager, fiery. The sticker is shiny silver. The 
man is Jay-Z. The album is Kingdom Come. He’s back.
Or did he never leave in the first place? Sure, he had a 
retirement concert, and he said he “got tired of rap," but 
to say Jay-Z disappeared from the limelight would be a 
gross overstatement. Appearing at various concerts and 
making guest appearances on albums and TV shows, 
Jay-Z's retirement was more like Kiss’ "Farewell Tour.” 
So, when Jay-Z released Kingdom Come on November 
21, it was seen as the "comeback record,” expectations 
and hype impossibly high.
Hov did not quite satisfy the buzz. On paper, Kingdom 
Come might possibly be the most star-studded lineup 
a hip-hop record has ever seen. (Yes, it rivals Dr. Dre’s 
2001.) Production duties go to a wide variety of stars 
ranging from The Neptunes, Swizz Beatz, Dr. Dre, Just 
Blaze, Kanye West, and — heck — even Coldplay’s 
Chris Martin. Guest appearances on the album include 
John Legend, Beyonce, Pharell Williams, and Martin 
himself. With an arsenal like this, how could President 
Carter go wrong?
He went wrong in two ways: substandard beats and 
substandard lyrics. His verses are predominantly self- 
conscious and cocky, and his hooks are uninteresting, 
lacking the catchiness of his old material.
In “30 Something,” a.fabulous bass line and pounding 
drum pattern barrel their way through an otherwise 
monotonous track with a contrived string pattern. And 
Jay-Z's lyrics are just as stagnant as the music. He raps 
about how he’s hip and cool as a 30-something-yeai-old, 
not letting age affect his lifestyle of luxury and class:
“I’m young enough to know the right car to buy but 
grown enough not to put rims on it," he claims.
Although some of the Dre beats are a bit of a letdown 
(the boring “Lost Ones" and generic club-banger 
"Trouble" are tracks to be forgotten) and Jay's lyrics a 
bit shallow, there are still some interesting ideas going 
on in this album. On “Minority Report," Dre finally 
picks up his sincerity and integrity, dropping a sparse 
drumbeat with dark piano and thunderstorm sound 
effects: It sounds like a beat Dre would have made for 
Eminem five years ago, a la “The Way I Am.” The beat 
allows Jay-Z to use his position as a respected rapper 
and cultural icon to dabble in Katrina-based political 
statements: "The commander-in-chief just flew by.
Did he stop? No... [He] ignored 'em.” Finally, Jay stops 
focusing on himself and says something significant.
The album’s highlights are the punch of Just Blaze, a 
producer who Jay-Z signed to his own label, Roc-a-fella 
Records (Jay-Z has since climbed the ranks to CEO of 
Island/Def Jam). “Oh My God” features a surprisingly 
appropriate sample of the Allman Brothers’ "Whipping 
Post," subduing intensity in the chorus and then 
exploding in the verse. Jay borrows a Kanye line and
raps, “If this is your first time hearin’ this, you are about 
to experience somethin’ so cold."
Blaze's "Kingdom Come” is a fabulous New York 
anthem. This marks one of the few points in the 
record where Jigga's confidence and self-praise seems 
justified. With Rick James’ “Super Freak" sampled in 
the background, the opening lines come out swinging 
with “I don’t know what life will be in h-i-p-h-o-p would 
¦ be without the boy h-o-v." The hook has Hov chanting,
“I came to New York, New York / Not only NYC / I’m 
hip-hop's savior, so after this flow you might owe me 
a favor,” over the dense rock drumming and slamming 
high-end piano lines.
The CD’s first single, "Show Me What You Got,” samples 
the saxophone from "Darkest Light” by Lafayette 
Afro.Rock Band. After the awesome “This is a state of 
emergency ... Wachoo want me to do? I'm sorry, but 
I’m back," the tracks blasts into an epic track with big- 
band horns, flashy piano glissandos, and possibly the 
most intricate drum beat ever to appear on a hip-hop 
record. Somehow, Jay-Z gets his flow together and 
syncopates with cocky shots like, “I am the Mike Jordan 
of recording” and "The king's back!" It's the confident 
swagger and comical wordplay that made us fall in love 
with Jay-Z in the first place.
The most interesting track on the record is undoubtedly 
Chris Martin's “Beach Chair,” both musically and 
lyrically. Airy drums and melodic keyboard lines support 
Coldplay’s frontman throughout. Though somewhat 
introspective, Jay's flow is impeccable. Even in his 
moments of inner soul-searching, Jay is still as intense 
as always: "I'm not afraid of dyin’, I'm afraid of not 
tryin."’ And of course, it wouldn’t be a Jay-Zalbum 
without a fortune cookie at the end: “This is Jay every 
day no compromise / No compass comes with this life 
just eyes / So to map it out you must look inside / Sure 
books can guide you but your heart defines you.”
Sure, this isn't H-to-the-izz-O’s best record, but there 
are definitely a few tracks that will someday make it 
to his greatest hits, and rightfully so. It doesn't top 
Blueprint, or even the Black Album, but Jay-Z is still 
. wearing his heart on his sleeve, letting us eager fans 
into the secrets of his fantastical life. And as his fan 
club, we can only thank him for every minute of it, even 
if some parts are better than others.,

in a sense, the creation of some music albums can be viewed as the 
creation of artifacts, like a precipitate left after a chemical reaction. In 
the case of Joanna Newsom's Ys, the songs are artifacts of events 
that she experienced over the course of a year. Listening to it, I begin 
to think that perhaps the lengthy nature of the songs is an attempt to 
take the microscopically small moments we experience and stretch 
them into a more tangible form. The moments we realize we are look­
ing at something beautiful and mysterious — and the mornings we 
wake up and realize we are in love — are all moments that come, go, 
and change something inside of us. To me, Newsom has managed 
to capture the magical wonder that comes with such times. She has 
crafted what most of us are incapable of creating in our lives: a firm, fi­
nite representation of possibly infinite feelings and transformations that 
she has experienced. She is offering us proof of these occurrences.
The sound of the album is quite unlike anything else out today. New­
som is a classically trained harpist, and has a versatile, unique voice. 
This album also sounds different from her debut because she chose 
to embellish most of the songs with an orchestra, as well as an ac­
cordion and other sounds. The orchestrations were penned by Van 
Dyke Parks, who worked with Brian Wilson on both the 1966 and 
2004 Smile album sessions. In terms of recording, the album was en­
gineered by Steve Albini and produced by Jim O’Rourke, two unimag­
inably colossal gods in the music world. Albini has recorded bands 
like Low, Nirvana, and Slint, while O’Rourke made Sonic Youth good 
again a few years back and released solo work that spans the rock, 
experimental, and electronic genres. In short, an overwhelming moun­
tain of talent has come together to make this record — and it sounds 
minimal! The instrumentation is gentle, the production transparent; 
Newsom’s voice is always at the center of your attention. It was a relief 
for me to hear the album and notice that Newsom retained complete 
control over the sound despite collaborations with industry superstars 
who overshadow her in experience.
In relation to her debut, The Milk Eyed Mender, Ys is a more epic af­
fair and, in a way, represents everything a strong sophomore album 
(something that almost no band can achieve these days) should be: 
more adventurous, personal, and exciting, while retaining the musical 
elements that made the first such a fascinating debut — the minimal 
setting of harp and voice.

Performing for AIDS awareness
SPIRIT and SHARE combine to put on a talent show
Diversity. On campus, we see it as we walk across the Cut 
on the way to lecture, in front of Doherty as students table 
for different events and causes, and even in the people 
of “Walking to the Sky." SPIRIT, a minority organization, 
embraces the cultural differences among the students of 
Carnegie Mellon, earning itself a name that reflects the 
vibrant energy of its constituents.
Last Friday, SPIRIT held a talent show in Kin Commons of 
the University Center as part of the UC Late Night series.
The black chairs were packed with people, while others 
stood in the back and on the steps. And this was not just a 
talent show. Students Helping AIDS Relief and Education 
(SHARE) partnered with SPIRIT to bring the program to the 
University Center. Senior social and decision sciences major 
Rosalyce Broadous-Brown, the president of SPIRIT, explained 
the alliance with SHARE: "Initially, we wanted to do a talent 
show,” she said. "The opportunity to work with SHARE came 
because of the dinner to benefit AIDS research. SHARE did 
most of the dinner [planning] and we did most of the talent
* show [planning]."
Overall, the success of the talent show reflected a combined 
effort. First-year art and creative writing student Jessica 
Smith, SPIRIT's community service chair, worked extensively 
with SHARE to bring this event to fruition. Other student 
organizations helped out too: SPIRIT and SHARE received 
financial help from the Students Activities office, and AB Tech 
sent a representative to make sure all the sound equipment 
ran well.
In the talent show, the participants brought a variety of 
performances. From poetry readings and recitals to the SPIRIT
dance troupe, the audience was witness to plenty of amateur 
talent. There was even a self-proclaimed "avant-garde" jazz 
performance, in which a student switched from saxophone to 
flute in the middle of the act. Other highlights included two 
vocal performances and a comedy act. Everyone, including 
Broadous-Brown, was surprised when a man named Kevin 
asked if he could be given a chance to sing. "Kevin was a 
guy that just came out of nowhere," said Broadous-Brown. 
However, everyone seemed delighted to hear his karaoke 
as he sustained notes that many women probably could 
not reach. Sterling Berliant, one of the audience members, 
decided "Kevin was the bomb.... Kevin is my homeboy for 
life."
Despite the acclaim for Kevin, the winner of the talent show 
was the National Society of Black Engineers (NSBE) Step 
Team. Its members themed their routine after an archetypal 
James Bond movie and recited their pledges mid-step. How 
did SPIRIT determine the winners? This is when the service 
portion of the evening comes in.
SHARE raises money for a clinic in rural South Africa that 
helps HIV-positive individuals in the area; Friday night's 
proceeds went towards that organization as well. For every 
performer of the evening, a cup was set aside. Audience 
members were encouraged to contribute a bit of money for 
their favorite act. The act with the most money in its cup at 
the end of the night was the winner.
Another major part of SHARE’S goal is to educate people 
about AIDS. Commanding the stage between acts, group 
members asked the audience multiple-choice questions 
about the AIDS pandemic. They then threw candy out for
those who chose the correct answers. Some interesting facts 
were pointed out. For example, AIDS is a unique disease 
in that it can affect everyone, not just the young or elderly. 
Perhaps one of the most shocking facts was that the amount 
of people that die of AIDS in one week is equivalent to the 
number of soldiers killed in the Vietnam War. SHARE even 
tied the pandemic to other aspects of rural African life; AIDS 
affects one-fifth of the agricultural workers in South Africa, 
contributing to the lack of food. Supporting SHARE’S cause, 
SPIRIT helped collect money through both the dinner and the 
talent show.
Even though SPIRIT maintained a very philanthropic aspect 
to the talent show, some of the group's events are just for 
fun. “This was the first year that we didn't do the SPIRIT 
cabaret," said Broadous-Brown, explaining that SPIRIT's 
events change from year-to year. “We did a karaoke night and 
we will probably do another open mic night." In addition to 
these events, the group also holds movie nights. One of their 
biggest shows is the SPIRIT fashion show. SPIRIT maintains a 
strong presence on campus by engaging in these activities.
SPERIT’s description is in its name. The show was full of 
vibrant and talented people who cheered for each other and 
rejoiced in their individual skills. It was easy to see the heavy 
spirit encompassed in everything the group's members do.

We’re hot. Let’s celebrate that once a month.
Student-created Teaser Calendar features on-campus beauties
"We’re a big nerdy school. That’s what everyone thinks," said 
Jonathan Kyle, a sophomore mechanical engineering major. 
Kyle and two fellow sophomore mechanical engineering 
majors, Carlton Reeves and Randolph Scott-McLaughlin, are 
going pretty far to make sure people see that Carnegie Mellon 
students have beauty to go along with their brains. The 
group has created the Teaser Calendar, featuring 12 attractive 
female students, to dispel rumors of Carnegie Mellon's 
unattractive student body.
After seeing the success of the projects completed by an 
entrepreneurship class offered at Carnegie Mellon, Kyle, 
Reeves, and Scott-McLaughlin decided to create their own 
money-making venture. “I always had this entrepreneur bug 
in me,” Kyle said. "The first night we got the idea for the 
calendar we stayed up until four in the morning planning it 
out, and the very next day we started working on it.”
In seven weeks, the trio took the calendar from concept 
to finished product without skipping any steps along the 
way. They went through the process of creating their own 
company, Reeves Calendars, and took out a loan for start-up 
funds. The entrepreneurs selected a high-quality offset press • 
to print the calendars. "We wanted to make a product that we 
would want to buy,” Kyle said. The three strove to maintain
the utmost professionalism. "Everything is copyrighted. Our 
name is trademarked," Reeves said.
The Teaser Calendar is an academic calendar for the 2007 
calendar year that provides useful dates for Carnegie Mellon 
students such as course drop deadlines, the begin and 
end dates for semesters and minis, days where classes are 
canceled, and online registration dates. A different Carnegie 
Mellon woman is pictured for each month, and as the name of 
the calendar suggests, the women's pictures are intended to 
be a bit seductive.
Angela Lynn, a senior material science and engineering major, 
appears in the Teaser Calendar for the month of October. “I 
thought it was an interesting idea,” Lynn said. "I like breaking 
stereotypes, so that was fun for me.” Though the photos of 
the women are provocative, Kyle insisted that the pictures 
wouldn’t even make a mother blush. "At first people though 
it was going to be naked girls.” he said. "We kept it classy I'd 
say.” In Lynn's calendar shot, she poses in the courtyard of 
Mudge House in a striking vintage dress. “I think it’s artistic," 
Lynn said.
In the process of putting the calendar together, Kyle, Reeves, 
and Scott-McLaughlin have done an extensive amount of
legwork themselves. "I did-the'photography,” Kyle said. “I 
process my own film and I make my own prints." Beyond the 
creative aspects of the calendar, the entrepreneurs also are 
learning the requisite business skills for operating a company. 
"My dad is teaching me how to do all the finance and the 
spreadsheets," said Reeves, who is additionally majoring in 
business administration. “We’ve learned so much.”
“There will be some surprises in the calendar," Lynn promised. 
The Teaser Calendars will be sold starting tomorrow outside of 
Doherty, at the Forbes and Morewood crosswalk, and outside 
the UC. They will be available soon at the Carnegie Mellon 
bookstore.

cop and a crook must team 
up to take down a local gang, 
and — OK, trust me, the plot 
doesn’t matter. What matters 
is that the action scenes have 
more energy and movement

wussy computer effects. A 
breathtaking waste of time. Go: 
Reckless, insane stunt work in

International films premiere at ‘Faces of Dem<
Carnegie Mellon class organizes major film festival that brings politics to the forefront for Pittsburgh
Last Wednesday night, the South Side Works Cinema 
marquee wasn’t boasting Borat, Happy Feet, or Casino 
Royale. Instead, the evening belonged to Carnegie Mellon's 
"Faces of Democracy” international film festival, a two-week- 
long event organized by a class in the College of Humanities
& Social Sciences. Called "The Film Festival: Faces of 
Democracy in Contemporary World Cinema,” the course was 
ambitious from day one, when director Jolanta Lion handed 
out a 16-page syllabus. The students involved had only 
three months to organize and promote a festival of global 
proportions.
"They've done a very good job of getting a variety of films 
that all meet the standards of their theme,” said Andrew 
Horbal, a local film blogger and graduate of the University of 
Pittsburgh. "These things are extraordinarily difficult to pull 
off on the level that they’re doing it.” The festival includes
11 feature-length films, each offering a unique perspective 
on democracy outside of the United States. “It’s a brilliant 
lineup," Horbal said. "They got some great filmmakers that 
don’t get nearly enough recognition, let alone recognition in 
Pittsburgh."
Feature presentation
All but one of the full-length films are Pittsburgh premieres. 
One, the Croatian I Love You, has never before been 
screened in the U.S. “Most of this stuff’s never going to play 
in Pittsburgh otherwise,” Horbal explained. “It's a service for 
moviegoers too because this is something you’re not going 
to get a chance to see [otherwise].”
Lion and her class arranged for six of the films’ directors to 
appear in the festival by introducing their films, engaging in 
question and answer sessions, and presenting supplemental 
lectures. One filmmaker managed to participate in the 
festival without even entering the country. Often called the
Michael Moore of Israel, director Avi Mograbi interacted with 
filmgoers via teleconference following the screening of his 
controversial work Avenge But One of My Two Eyes.
The "Faces of Democracy" festival also features student- 
made shorts from around the world, many of which 
document countries and regions other than those addressed 
in the feature-length films, including Siberia and Japan.
The shorts were evaluated in a contest organized by the 
class, featuring guest judges Horbal and Barry Paris of 
the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, among others. "We did a 
competition and sent out an e-mail with the qualifications 
to different schools all over,” explained Quelcy Kogel, artistic 
director to the festival.
Behind the scenes
Working towards a B.A. in architecture, Hispanic studies, 
and international relations, fifth-year student Kogel was 
one of the class’s most active participants. “The more you 
gave, the more responsibilities you would get, essentially,” 
she said. In addition to working individually, the class 
divided into four committees: selection, design, finance/ 
administration, and public relations. "Some people tried new 
things. Some English people went into the budget realm," 
Kogel added. “It was a broad range.”
But first, the students had to learn about film as an art 
form. “The beginning of the course was very difficult,” Lion 
said. Her class drew from a variety of majors within H&SS. 
According to Lion, most of her students had little experience 
with international cinema. Prior to the class, some of them 
had never even seen a film with subtitles.
Though pressed for time, Lion devoted the first half of her 
course to educating her students in film analysis. Now, a 
week into the festival, Lion's impression on her class is clear.
“They know how to watch art," she said. "The students 
didn't watch some of the films in the program, and now 
instead of staying out of the room talking I see them going 
into the room watching. And then when I want to talk to 
them during the film, they say, ‘Don’t interrupt.’ ’’
Bonus material
"Faces of Democracy” aims to reach all of Pittsburgh, not just 
its students. With its various pockets of ethnic communities, 
the city is a choice location for the screening of international 
film. "You have people participating because they want 
to promote their country, their language, and that kind of 
thing,” said Kogel. In addition to allowing its patrons to 
explore their own heritages, the festival should promote a 
diverse cultural understanding. "[It says,] ‘Come see this 
Czech movie because you’re Czech, but also come see this 
Polish movie,"’ Kogel explained. “ ‘Or just come see the one- 
from South America, because there may be similar issues.’ ”
With citywide ambitions, “Faces of Democracy" is larger 
than any film festival ever to emerge from H&SS. The class 
is in its 10th year, but this is the first time it's hosting a 
festival with off-campus screenings. Though the University 
Center’s McConomy Auditorium is the primary venue, Lion 
and students have arranged for some of the showings to 
take place at the South Side Works Cinema and the Regent 
Square Theater. “It’s commercial, but it gave the event 
something special... for the opening night,” said Kogel of the 
South Side location. “It’s very dramatic."
Expanding its venues is only one example of how the 
“Faces of Democracy” festival has grown. “We have a much 
bigger budget, we have outside sponsors, we have a lot 
more movies," Kogel explained. “We’re hoping for a bigger 
attendance." Such an endeavor required an incredible effort 
from Lion’s class of 19, fueled by the guidance of a director

Twenty pages. Two stories, three poems. Paintings, sketches, lithographs; 
residue of464 submissions.
Ink. Paper. What is Dossier?
Once upon a time, Dossier was Carnegie Mellon’s official art and literary 
magazine. Today, Monday, December 4, it still is. I am very proud to an­
nounce that Dossier is back.
One year and eight students constructed this magazine. Next year there 
will be a new editor, new students. This is only the beginning.
But oh, what a beginning it has been.
I would like to thank everyone who has worked with me. Writers, editors, 
artists, teachers, friends.
I would like to thank Katherine Rubenstein for contributing her 
sketchbook. Jon May for the beautiful drawings. Cecilia Westbrook, Jessie 
Chen, Joel Kraut, Sally Mao, Nathan Marsh. Greg Hanneman and The 
Tartan copy staff. Theresa Chen, Katherine Rubenstein, Joanna Bresee, 
Katherine Hallberg, Vanessa Butler. I’d like to thank Franklin Williams for 
getting me involved in the paper during Orientation freshman year. The 
entire staff of The Tartan. Alii Webber for your smile. Jim Daniels for your 
continuing support. Graham Pugh for your amazing ability to always make 
me smile.
Most of all, I want to thank Ari, Patricia, and Franco. My advisors, 
teachers, friends. Thank you for letting me be more than just a writer, just 
an artist. Please read Dossier as a thank you letter to you all.
I hope you read Dossier. I hope you crumple it up and leave it in your back­
pack. Lose it under a sofa, and find it two years later. Pick it up, and read it 
all again. And maybe, just maybe, a writer will pick up a pen and make a 
piece of art. Maybe an artist will write a story. That’s all I want.
Thank you.
Danielle Saudino,
Dossier Editor 2006
PS. If you are interested in submitting work to Dossier, e-mail digital files 
to dossier@thetartan.org, or visit Dossier online at dossier.thetartan.org.

Cataclysmic San Francisco 
by Sally Mao
Silver-plated as the ghosts frozen during Christmas 
in the courtyard, my sister’s pursed 
lips swallow a smile.
The huge Times Square clock is a hoop earring
dangling from the side of Macy’s;
its brass hour hand
eats away our capacities for patience.
IS years ago there was the earthquake that 
swept our neighborhood off its big caiiused feet, 
left our family 
homeless, before I was born. My sister was two. She 
remembers
the torn streets, the desperation, the scent of 
blood in the salt-ocean air. Now she’s a poet; 
writes poems that shake the earth;
small envelopes with cataclysms inside.
Seismic moments still assail us
in walks, in lantern-lit Chinatown, in Victorian houses,
in dreams. My breai!.
is visible for a second, and then vanishes into her hair.

Seoul, by Deanna May Mu lye
Drawing by Jonathan May
ft all starts at a family restaurant In Korea. No, not a family restaurant A nightclub. A Korean night club* It will be dark and 
hot several floors in each direction, dance floors on every one. There will be tiny black-haired girls wearing tight clothes and 
sparkling makeup above their eyes. They will dance like this is the last night of their lives, like ail eyes are on them. The eyes 
belonging to the tall men with model bodies and perfectly groomed hair, the men that will lean against the bars (two or three on each floor} and dance only when they know they will be abie to procure what they are here for — sex. And among the Wade* 
lit din* there will be a stranger, one with light brown hair and eyes the color of furious waters, His skin will be pale and Jaw well defined. He will be our hero.
I've been mapping this thing out for an hour. I've been trying to loosen up like Sarah told me to* way back whenever that was, 
years ago. And I think 1‘ve been doing a damn good job of it, and she knows it, but shell be damned to admit ft. I tell her that 
I’m going to write something, write a story or a piay, about an American man who meets an American girt in a Korean night dub,

---------------------------------------------------

"Sounds tragic,” she says. “How does it start?” I tell her that it starts in a nightclub, the hottest place in Seoul, and over crackling 
telephone wires. She replies, “Oh that's nice. But have you even been to a nightclub?”“Not in Seoul."
“Anywhere?”
I don’t honor the question with an reply and instead try to change the topic, but the static from the phone gets louder and louder 
and I think perhaps it sounds more like a plastic bag than actual static. “It’s breaking up,” I hear her say. “I’ll talk to you later. Next 
time, I’ll call you.” She hangs up. I remember that I’m sitting in a restaurant and I look down at the menu that’s been staring me in 
the face for a half hour. I close my eyes, point, and show my finger to the waitress. She smiles and nods and hurries away. I don’t 
read or speak Korean, but I’m living here all the same. I wouldn’t know a nightclub even if I saw the sign for one.
I’m upset about my conversation with Sarah. The part that I didn’t convey very well to her, and now I’ll clarify the point to you, is 
that the story isn’t tragic. David (our hero) and Evelyn (the girl) get out alive and I’m quite sure that they end up living on a tropical 
island somewhere in the South Pacific. The island is deserted, of course, and they live on to repopulate and create an idealistic 
society. But the story ends before that, so I’m not going to bother explaining away the problems of incest and sustenance and so 
on. The point \s that they live happily ever after.
I’m served something with tentacles. I’m a 24-year-old man, but have had very little life experience. I grew up in a small town, a 
middle-of-nowhere town. I came to Korea because the spiders in my parent's basement were too big for me to handle. I came here because Sarah refused to kiss me after I brought her a flower at work; I came here because I suspected she might kiss me if I were 
leaving for a foreign country for an undetermined period of time. She didn’t.
Instead of eating the dish, I get up and continue my week-long search for a store that carries boxer shorts.
David walks along the sidewalk the night after meeting Evelyn. I should mention, briefly, that they didn’t technically meet, but 
rather shared a long and complicated gaze across the dance floor that night in the club, two pairs of blue eyes connected in a sort 
of chemical lighting that only they could see. David lost sight of her after that and went home alone and cold, but not without 
feeling as though something had happened.
Instead of waiting for Sarah to call -which, if patiently waited for, is something i’ve learned may never happen at all-I write her a 
letter. An e-mail, if you want to be technical about things. “E-mail” isn’t as romantic as “letter.” Dear Sarah, I begin, because I 
believe formality can be appreciated no matter what medium is being used to communicate. After our conversation the other night, I 
realized that you have a point. So last night, I went out and found a nightclub to visit. It was an eye-opening experience, and I really think there 
will be some fire behind my writing. Ill send it to you when it’s ready
What happened was this: I ended up asking one of the other teachers - did I mention 1 teach English? That’s why I’m here. I teach 
five days a week, ten hours a day. My students are all younger than twelve. I enjoy the work. Word has it that I’m the “cool” teacher 
to have. However, after a great deal of research and cultural analysis, I realized that the nickname given to me by a couple of my 
students translates to “shithead" in English. I’m not really sure how to respond to that.

---------------------------------------------------

As I was saying, I asked one of the other teachers if he knew of a place I could go to, a “nightclub" specifically. He gave 
me two addresses, warning me that that they were very different, but both technically nightclubs. So I went to find the 
first address, but got hopelessly lost. The next night, I tried the second address, which I found with no trouble 
whatsoever, but only because of a very helpful woman I met along the way. I must have been walking down the 
sidewalk looking like a lost puppy. “American?" she asked, and I nodded.
“English?” I asked, and she nodded.
“What are you looking for?” she asked. I showed her the address and she got a huge smile on her face. “Oh yeah,” she 
said. “I will come with you, show you the way.” She winked at me. Perhaps you can tell where this is going. I couldn’t.
I’m not that open-minded yet, although I’m getting better. Getting better by the day. Sarah would be proud, but I don’t 
want to give her ail of the details. In other news, I made a new friend. Her name is Jenny. In other news, the weather has been 
getting a lot nicer.
Jenny led me through some alleyways, “shortcuts,” she claimed. I barely knew left from right, and of course my nerves were jumping like mad. But it didn’t really matter where she led me, since she had taken the slip of paper with the 
address on it, and I’ll be damned if I can remember anything useful in a time of crisis.
We ended up in front of a relatively normal-looking building, one with no sign or indication of what might be inside. Jenny expertly led me to a door at the side of the building, down yet another dark little alley. She knocked on the door 
three times and it opened. I peered inside and could see what amounted to a drug-den-torture-chamber-Disney-movie piano-bar, minus the piano and with the inclusion of a host of scantily-clad Korean girls, and perhaps a few men thrown 
in for good measure. I didn’t stay for long.
If nothing else, it’s excellent fodder for my story. Play. Whatever it was that I’m going to write. It’s too much for me not 
to tell Sarah any more, since it was such an odd night, so I simplify things. I made a new friend, her name is Jenny. She 
introduced me to a number of her friends as well. I write a little bit more about what I did yesterday and today, and what I 
plan to do tomorrow — largely uninteresting stuff — and send the letter off with an innocuous “Take care!” preceding 
my name. We used to sign all of our letters “Love," but that ended when her eighteen-year-old cat died and, in mourn­
ing, she took on a boyfriend in Baltimore. She stopped talking to me for about six months. I’ll admit that I didn’t 
handle that very well. But hey, she’s my soul mate. That’s right. My soul-mate. We met at band camp when I was fifteen. Nine years later, and we‘re still connected. We’ll sign our letters with “Love” again, I’m sure.
After running into each other in the street and going for a walk in the park together, David and Evelyn fall madly in love 
— madly. And after a few short weeks of passion and doing all of the things that people in love do, the war breaks out. 
“Darling,” Evelyn says as they can hear warning sirens and frantic screams in Korean. “Don’t leave my side, not for a moment!”
David puts his arm around her shoulders and together they run, holding a newspaper above their heads to keep the 
dust from raining down on them. The city has been bombed. Everything is a shambles. But together they run, arm in 
arm. They pass a bloody body in the street. A tear springs into Evelyn’s eye. David wipes it away and smiles at her. “Don’t worry," he says. “I’ll take care of you.”
I’ve decided to make it a story instead of a play. A nightclub would be hard enough to stage, but concrete buildings 
being blasted to the ground? I know my limits. And I know that the story may seem a little melodramatic right now, but 
there’s always rewriting. Editing. Always a second chance. If I keep trying, odds are decent that I’ll get it done before I die.
I sent Sarah’s letter yesterday, but have yet to get a response. The whole day passes by and I teach my classes at the 
school, thinking not of Sarah or the story, but rather about Jenny, for whatever reason. After being introduced to the 
den of sin, I’d shaken my head violently and crossed my arms, “No, no, no." Jenny looked a little confused. She paused. 
Then she grinned. She handed me a homemade business card. Jenny, it read, followed by a phone number. I pocketed 
it and she led me back to the spot where I’d met her. “Subway?" I asked, and of course she understood. She led me 
around the block to a station, kissed me on the cheek, and disappeared into another dark alleyway. She left red lipstick on my cheek.
Tonight I’ve set aside time to write. I make some rice, which is all I can stand to eat these days, and set myself up at my 
little desk. I put the desk in front of the largest window in the apartment. It has a view of the north side of the city, and 
I enjoy looking out at the lights in the evening. I try to write a scene in which Evelyn is sent a plane ticket from a

---------------------------------------------------

benefactor, unbeknownst to David. This is her ticket to safety, and of course it’s a difficult situation for both of them. She 
breaks down and shows him the ticket. He wants her to use it, to be safe and live out a full life. On the other hand, he’s 
been alone for so long, and a person can only tolerate being alone for so long. They have a bitter argument about what 
Evelyn should do — "I think I’m in love with you,” they both blurt out at the same moment. In a moment of heightened tension and passion, Evelyn sets the ticket on fire and throws it out the window, letting it float down to the ground in an 
orange blaze.
I’m not sure what happens next. The sky is getting dark and the lights of the city turn on one by one. I can’t stop 
glancing at my phone, which I’ve set on the desk beside me. I keep thinking that it’s going to ring, but it doesn’t. I hope 
Sarah calls. She ought to, she said she would. But if she doesn’t, I’ll understand. Transcontinental calls are expensive.
A few minutes have passed, and i’ve decided to bite the bullet. I’ll call her Just to check up. I pull my wallet out of my 
pants and rifle through it. Several slips of paper fall out onto my desk, most with phone numbers or addresses scribbled 
down. Of course I know Sarah’s number by heart. I do have trouble remembering all of the extra numbers that I now have 
to dial, however.
I find the slip of paper and punch in the numbers. It rings. “Hello?” Her voice is cheerful. She’s in a good mood."
“Hi, Sarah,” I reply.
I have a sixth sense. Maybe it isn’t a sense. Maybe it’s a heightened perception, or the ability to feel changes in air 
pressure when the mood of a person drastically changes. I’m not a mystic or a religious person, I’m one of those 
faux-Catholics who claims to not believe in anything but goes to church occasionally, just in case. But that doesn’t 
matter. What does matter is that I pay attention to everything — the way other people breathe, the color of the sky, what way the wind is blowing, and how loud my ears are ringing. So after I say hello, I already know what’s going on. It’s 
something bad, maybe not for Sarah, but most certainly for me,
“Oh, hi," she replies in a flat voice. “What’s up?”
“Well I just wanted to see
“I’m sorry,” she interrupts. She talks like a cashier who is fed up with underage kids trying to buy cigarettes. “I can’t really 
talk right now."
“Okay, I’m sorry, how about tomor—I say, but she’s already gone.
David and Evelyn think they are doomed. The burning ticket landed in the rubble of a bombed restaurant. The fire latched 
on to the splintered beams of the building and quickly spread down into the ruins, eventually finding its way to a line of gas ovens, professional grade. Luckily, the gas lines had been traumatized during the bombing as well, so explosion that 
resulted was not quite as large as it could have been. Nevertheless, David and Evelyn find themselves trapped on the 
sixth floor of a burning building. How will they escape this one? Your guess is a good as mine.
Sarah sent me an e-mail this morning apologizing for her shortness on the phone. I know how much calling costs, she 
writes. I didn’t mean to make you feel bad, but James had just arrived and I haven’t seen him for almost a year and he 
was only in town on a layover for a couple of hours. I hope you understand. James is the boyfriend she picked up after 
the cat died. He moved about year ago, so it’s been off-again, on-again. I guess it must be on-again again.
It’s the weekend. Two days with no classes to teach, not that I care much about them anyway. Two days to spend exploring the city, making new friends, learning Korean, finding a real nightclub, hanging out with the other teachers 
from the school, people I can actually communicate with. I know where they hang out — an apartment just a couple of 
blocks from mine. They play board games and drink themselves under the coffee table. It sounds like a good time.
I sit down at my desk and reach for my phone. I have the numbers of the other teachers, but I call Jenny instead. I’ve 
spent more one-on-one time with her than I have with any of the teachers, so it makes sense. A Korean woman 
answers — not Jenny. “Is Jenny there?" I ask. The woman screams something at me in Korean. Of course I can’t under­
stand it, so I repeat the question. More screaming. I get a strange feeling in my stomach. Could something be wrong? 
Could she be in trouble, and this woman is screaming for help? “Are you okay? Where’s Jenny?”

---------------------------------------------------

“No Jenny!” I hear, and the phone goes dead.
It’s fine. I didn’t really want to talk to her anyway.
My whole philosophy has boiled down to this, I don’t really need anyone else. Anyone else, that is, except for Sarah. I 
met Sarah and my whole life made sense. We are going to be together eventually, one of these days, and we both know 
it’s true. What happens in the meantime can simply be chalked up to life experience. She’s in a relationship with a guy 
who doesn’t really love her and they have sex. She’s not quite sure what she wants. I’m in a relationship with Korea 
and we don’t have sex. I know exactly what I want. Opposites attract, everyone knows it. We’re both growing up, and 
when we come back together — well, it’s going to be amazing. It’s going to be everything we ever wanted.
I spend the rest of the night sitting at the desk. I pull the shades shut so I can’t see the city lights and try to focus on 
the story. David and Evelyn are trapped. They can hear bombs going off across the city. Suddenly, a man appears in a 
stairwell. He seems to know what he’s doing. David grabs Evelyn’s hand and together they follow the man to the roof 
of the building. The man backs up and runs towards the edge of the building. David and Evelyn gasp. The man leaps 
through the air and lands on the roof of the next building. David and Evelyn smile. It’s not far to jump.
Suddenly, the man yells, desperation on his face. The building beneath him begins to shake violently. In an explosion 
of dust and sparks, the building collapses, the man with it. David and Evelyn are wide eyed, in shock. Smoke billows up around them. The fire is getting worse. They look at one another. Now what?
I’ve already told you what happens to David and Evelyn — the thing about the tropical island. And trust me, it will happen. That’s simply the way the story ends.

This new song started out with a high-pitched chirp, almost a squeak, and resolved into a mellow and intense note. It 
hummed with life, and it was this hum that caught Lindsay’s attention. It was because she had heard a bird sing the 
same kind of song, many years before, in a life altogether different from the one she had become accustomed to. A 
song that hummed with life.
• V
“What bird is that?” she asks innocently, the image of youth and perfection in a bright orange life vest, which clings 
awkwardly to her eight-year-old torso.
“Well, sweetie, I guess I forgot my Audubon book. It’s lovely though.”
And she smiles at her father and agrees in a high-pitched chirp that resembles the bird more than any family 
member. And they dip their paddles into the still water of a lake the color of obsidian.
The memory hit her in the skull like a brick, jarring her out of a daze as though awakening from a coma. She realized 
that she was in the most sterile of environments. The bird played a sharp contrast to the whirring hum of the fax 
machine, to the click-click of phones being removed and re-alighted, tap-tap keyboards, padding of chunk-heels on 
cheap, thin carpet. Like a switchboard it lit up the nodes in her brain, each activating the others it touched. She remem­
bered the sound of the paddies in the water: a tiny slurp as they entered, and a wet kind of fart noise as you pulled 
them out. They were nearly silent inbetween. She remembered the sound of the loons, late at night, when she couldn’t 
sleep from stones poking through her Thermarest. She remembered the cold air and the intense sunshine, slowly 
bleaching the bright colors of her plastic gear. And she remembered the stars, strewn across the sky like pebbles, 
winking at her, slowly and interminably.
Birds, by Cecilia Westbrook

• I H B —It was the bird, more than anything, that got her thinking. Of course, all the other things in her life — that multitude of 
depressing, harrowing events that pulled her to her knees in less than a year — well, they were probably part of it, too. 
But if you had asked her, back when you still could have, she would have told you it was the bird that showed up outside the window that spring. Nothing else in her life — a long series of academic disappointments, a job that ceased 
to inspire, a marriage becoming more and more loveless with each passing day — if you’d asked her, she would have 
told you that none of those could possibly have set it all off.
It was that time of year, the one we never expect to arrive but always does. Winter had fallen away from spring, and you 
could just feel the distant breath of summer, as though nature were as impatient as you were. The birds that 
congregated outside of her office — it was a corner office, well-kept and organized, without the faintest breath of life in 
a single, utilitarian corner of it — were back for the spring. Or, more accurately, they were still there, where they’d been 
ail year. They had forgotten how to migrate; they could do nothing but sing their melancholy song in remorse, for the 
life they never knew they had lost. But this spring, there was a new bird, one that sang a sweet and beautiful song. It 
was, perhaps, some bird in from out of town, lost in the city on its way to some glorious land it would never reach 
again. Or maybe it was just a bird who had learned a new song: something glorious and wonderful that spoke of the 
world birds are supposed to have. That kind of thing happens in nature, sometimes.

Dcracy’ festivalby Sarah Mogin | Assistant Pillbox Editor
i audiences
who knew what she was doing. "She has a lot of experience from 
film festivals,” Kogel said, “so that level of quality is what she 
wanted for this one.”
Lion started teaching courses in language and film in her native 
country of Poland. Several years ago, she came to the University 
of Pittsburgh to pursue the same subjects. There, Lion hosted 
"Through Polish Eyes” in 2001. “It was another fantastic 
festival," Horbal said. "This is probably the best event since 
then." Besides Pittsburgh Filmmakers' “Three Rivers" and “Silk 
Screen" festivals, he added, Lion’s projects are at the height of 
Pittsburgh's film culture. Lion was also in charge of "Exposed,” 
an exhibition of European film held last summer in the South 
Side.
Director’s cut
Recruiting filmmakers to attend the festival alongside their art, 
Lion’s class hoped to increase the strength and memorability of 
each work of film. “We tried to give as many real voices to the 
festival as possible and to really push the issues," Kogel said.
“So it’s not just come in, watch a film, leave, and then possibly 
forget it. There's someone to explain a little background."
While editing My Country, My Country, a documentary 
chronicling the Iraqi elections, director Laura Poitras made 
an effort to keep herself out of the picture. “As a filmmaker, I 
didn't want to put myself in the story," Poitras said in a lecture 
in Doherty 2315 last Thursday. Films about Iraq often revolve 
around the Americans creating them, Poitras explained, but 
this sort of focus obscures the issues that are most in need 
of coverage. Her effort was hardly in vain; My Country, My 
Country provided an account of the elections through the 
authentic perspective of an Iraqi family.
Though they would have been out of place in her film, Poitras’ 
experiences tqjd their own story of the situation in Iraq. During
the lecture, Poitras shared what it was like to spend eight 
months abroad. Addressing an aerial shot from My Country, My 
Country of a sewage-ridden Iraqi street, Poitras explained that 
she did most of her outdoor filming with an escort from either 
the U.S. military or a private helicopter service. “It’s actually 
that bad that you can’t travel [safely] from one part of the 
country to another,” she said.
My Country, My Country comes with English subtitles to 
translate its subjects’ native Arabic. One thing audiences 
might not realize is that Poitras, though shooting a film 
located entirely in Iraq, understood hardly any of dialogue that 
she recorded until months later, after her footage had been 
transcribed. Despite this, Poitras said that she was able to 
predict which scenes would be important even before receiving 
any translations.
In the case of provocative, independent films, the process 
of production is often nearly as interesting as the stories 
themselves. “These movies, they affect people. They become 
part of people’s lives," Horbal said. "It’s easy to forget that a film 
is more than just what you’re seeing on the screen.”
Coming attractions
Lion chose the title "Faces of Democracy" with great care; she 
wanted to come up with a compelling label without suggesting 
a political agenda. “We are trying to explore [democracy] on a 
very personal level,” Lion said. “Faces” captures the intimate 
portrayals offered in each of its films, which is something Lion 
hopes to maintain in the years to come. “I would love to keep 
the title for future themes," she said.
Lasting through Sunday, the "Faces of Democracy" film festival 
has akeady proven itself a success. “I think they’ve done a 
great job," Horbal said. "You cannot have too many festivals like 
this.”

Making comedy out of tragedy
School of Drama puts a unique spin on Romeo and Juliet
The School of Drama calls It "one of the most revived, most 
translated to film, and most imitated plays in history.” 
Throughout the English-speaking world, it is hailed as 
Shakespeare’s most celebrated tragedy.
Romeo and Juliet is perhaps the most recognizable play in 
the western world, noted for the strong emotions between 
its love-struck teenage characters and the perils that ensue 
following their secret marriage. The strength of the lovers’ 
connection is both highly desirable and upsetting in the eyes 
of audience members. Director Laura Konsin expounded on 
the play’s appeal: “I think [it's] because of the beauty of the 
language, the dynamic and memorable characters, the hilarity 
of the comedy, and the depth and suspense of the tragedy."
Detailing the powerful emotional nature of the work,
Konsin stressed the play’s extreme highs and perilous lows. 
“Something we’re taking very seriously in our production is 
the fact that both Romeo and Juliet have the gift of prophecy. 
So the audience will see how circumstances quickly spin out 
of control in this very fast-paced, passionate, and supernatural 
world," she explained. "Romeo and Juliet... meet, fall in love, 
and kill themselves within the span of four days."
The School of Drama’s rendition of Borneo and Juliet takes 
traditional versions a step further. As Konsin explained, 
the focus on the supernatural is unique, as is the interplay 
between the actors and the audience. She emphasized the 
fact that Shakespeare "wrote very gritty, passionate, and even 
gory or fantastical plays." Following in this idea, the set was
designed so that there are no physical divisions between 
the stage and the audience, as scene director April Bartlett 
described.
Bartlett, a third-year graduate student studying set design, 
noted the significance of the fluidity of movement in the show. 
Calling the actors the "Shakespearean players" in the work, 
she designed the set so that “the orientation of the space” is 
conducive to travel across the set “in a very Shakespearean 
way."
According to Bartlett, the lack of physical divisions on stage 
allows for a sense of shared space between the actors and the 
audience in the theater, rather than placing a divider between 
them. Such an intimate environment pulls the audience 
deeper into Romeo and Juliet. "The audience is in the story,” 
she said. "They’re not just watching the story.”
Senior drama students Jordan Dean and Kristolyn Lloyd, cast, 
respectively, as Romeo and Juliet, have been trained to work 
in such a way that the notion of the play as a comedy will be 
amply translated. Dean and Lloyd will emphasize comedic 
moments and treat them as important scenes. According to 
Bartlett, Act I is the play’s funniest act.
For Konsin, this has been a goal from the beginning. While the 
play has its moments of tragedy, for which it is most famous, 
Konsin wants to emphasize the humorous scenes as well.
Konsin has actually been studying the text of Romeo and
Juliet for the past seven years, since she was an 
undergraduate student. Noting the director’s intimate 
understanding of the work, Bartlett said, "it was something 
[Konsin] was born to do.”
In fact, Konsin's close relationship with the play led her 
to create such a large vision for the show that it had to be 
scaled back. Instead of having a costume designer, Bartlett 
explained, the director, set designer, and others working on 
the show came together to create the actors’ clothing from 
their everyday materials. It was a "collaboration to create 
characters” from all those involved, she said, and provided a 
“good opportunity for the characters themselves to derive the 
clothing from the story.” Konsin, however, makes it clear that 
she drew her vision from the text, rather than superimposing 
an idea of her own on the classic work.
“Our production is contemporary, but encompasses the 
tangible actor/audience relationship that was very true of 
Shakespeare’s Globe Theater," she wrote in an e-mail. "And 
the production has a very vibrant energy which is very true to 
the extreme and passionate world of the play.”
Romeo and Juliet is playing in the Helen Wayne Rauh Studio 
Theater Wednesday through Saturday.

That ain’t No Way To Treat A Lady
Composer Douglas Cohen talks about turning a novel into a musical
The most visible people in any performance — theatre, opera, 
or film — are often the actors or singers. They are the ones 
who get the most public acknowledgment, despite the fact 
that there are many more people deeply involved: directors, 
producers, designers, writers, and composers. Douglas Cohen, 
a composer and lyricist most recognized for his show No Way 
to Treat a Lady, had the show performed by Scotch ’n’ Soda 
this past weekend.
No Way to Treat a Lady was originally a novel written by 
William Goldman that was later made into a feature film. 
Cohen was folding laundry in his New York apartment in the 
early ’80s when the film came on TV, and his creative wheels 
started turning. "I was really intrigued [by the film]," Cohen 
said. “It combined so many elements I found entertaining: 
romance, suspense, and comedy.” The book, which follows 
an unemployed actor, Kit Gill, and his attempts to gain his 
dead mother's approval by going on a killing spree, has a 
very dark tone and dry humor. Cohen saw it as great material 
for musical theater. "The idea started right away. I sat down 
at the piano and wrote five songs — one song, ’So Far So 
Good,’ actually made it into the final piece." Cohén said the 
inspiration came in part from the fact that he could relate to 
the characters: Moe Brummel, a Jewish cop who is still "tied
to his mother’s apron-strings," and Kit Gill, an unsuccessful 
actor who just wants to be accepted.
When Cohen called Goldman with the proposition to make 
the book into a musical, the author was hesitant, particularly 
because of the book's dark nature. "He didn’t understand 
why I would want to make [the book] into a musical, but the 
book is much darker than the show itself.” With Goldman's 
eventual approval, Cohen continued on the wild ride of 
writing an original musical score.
From 1985 to 1987, Cohen traveled from New York to Florida 
to London, performing the play and revising the songs. 
"[Premiering the show] in New York City was a mistake in 
hindsight," Cohen said. “Seldom you get things right the 
first move, and in New York they expect a finished product." 
Despite Cohen’s reservation about this initial performance, 
No Way to Treat a Lady was well received by audiences, 
though it still had a long way to go before making it as a 
commercial production. "The show had in no way the depth, 
the emotional arc that it does now," Cohen said. Arriong the 
revisions, the lead character shifted from Kit to Moe to give 
the. plot more of a moral center. Rather than a plot limited 
to the psycho-killer, the play included a sub-plot featuring a
romance between Moe Brummel and Sarah Stone, a socialite 
from the Upper East Side. While admitting that revising a 
piece he had worked so hard to perfect was a difficult task, 
Cohen said he was very thankful for the guidance and advice 
of the many directors and producers who helped him along 
the way. "Although I didn’t want to change things, if the right 
person can motivate you, you can make it happen," he said.
Cohen's most recent production was The Opposite of Sex.
He is currently working on Barnstormer, a musical based on 
the life of Bessie Coleman, the first African-American female 
aviator, who learned to fly in Paris. Cohen, who wrote the 
music for Barnstormer, recently received a Jonathan Larson 
Grant and will be traveling to Seattle in the spring for a two- 
week workshop culminating in three public performances.
When asked what advice to give to the many aspiring 
performers at Carnegie Mellon, Cohen said, "The best thing 
to do is find material that inspires you — and find good 
collaborators. The artistic experience is rarely a solitary one.”

With the semester finally coming to an end, you can rest easy knowing 
that you worked hard and accomplished a lot. Too bad all that effort was 
put into your World of Warcraft character. On the plus side, it’ll be much 
easier to get that legendary weapon without all that school in the way.
Hunt library will be open 24/7 during finals. I’d recommend bringing a 
pillow because if you’re going to take naps in there, you might as well 
drool into something soft and not some textbook.
Wikipedia is not really a credible source, and I would not recommend 
using it as the main reference for your final paper. This is especially 
applicable when you edited the information on there yourself. And by 
“edited,” I mean completely fabricated.
Don’t let Pittsburgh’s schizophrenic weather get to you. There are 
enough things to worry about and you don’t have the time to figure out 
what pair of shorts go with your parka. Look around campus — it really 
doesn’t matter what you wear anyway.
This will be the last issue of The Tartan this year. I know it’ll be hard 
to manage without your weekly source of insight and humor, but that 
doesn’t mean you need to do something drastic like read some other 
newspaper’s horoscope section.
With finals coming up, I would highly recommend trying to find the time 
to play a Nintendo Wii. Honestly, it’ll be the most fun you have before 
you go home and think of creative ways to destroy your report card- 
before your parents see it.
i don’t mean to state the obvious, but your shoelaces are untied. If 
you are not currently wearing your shoes, I would recommend going to 
where you left your shoes and checking anyway. See? I was right.
You’ll be confused when they put a “slippery when wet" warning on 
your floor considering that your dorm is carpeted.
Did you know that it’s not really healthy to consume nothing but caffeine 
and cigarettes for a week straight? This information brought to you by 
your friendly neighborhood Spiderman.
I would not recommend body-slamming the printer in West Wing when 
it gives you some issues with printing your final paper. I know that 
seems like pretty basic advice, but keep It in mind anyway.
It’s perfectly acceptable to cry yourself to sleep on occasion. However, 
expect a few awkward stares if you do it in the middle of your 3-D Calc 
exam.
Your parody of the popular T-shirt will not go over well with Carnegie 
Mellon officials, despite how funny “CMU kills; have sex and at least die 
happy” may be.

let’s go fly a kite.
Zhiquan Yeo | Photo Staff
Maddie Keller, junior drama major, flew her kite during a demonstration on the Cut this past Thursday. Drama 
majors showcased kites they designed for the Prague Quadrennial, where the theme is street theater. The drama 
students' kites are based on Aristophanes' The Birds.
