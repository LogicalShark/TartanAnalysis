GSA calls for more input on president
GRADUATE STUDENT ASSEMBLY
Special to The Tartan
On Oct. 15, the Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA), 
along with the Student 
Government Executive and 
the Undergraduate Student 
Senate, issued an open 
call through The Tartan 
to the Board of Trustees, 
expressing our displeasure 
towards students being 
excluded from the Presi-
dential Search Committee. 
More than four months 
later, we are writing to 
share our continued and 
increasing disappointment 
about this policy of ac-
tive exclusion. The only 
thing more unfortunate 
than the lack of student 
representation has been 
the silence the Board of 
Trustees has adopted 
and an implicit refusal to 
reform in the future.
Through that open call, 
we asked for student in-
clusion in the Presidential 
Search Committee. We also 
asked for more campus 
forums than the two token 
45-minute “listening” ses-
sions that were organized 
to gather student opinion. 
Students who at-
tended the fora decried 
the absence of student 
representation and the 
opaqueness with which 
the search process was 
being conducted. They also 
voiced frustration at the 
Search Committee’s refusal 
to answer direct questions. 
But, members of the Search 
Committee were steadfast 
in keeping up appearances 
and ignoring the students’ 
requests. 
We proposed that the 
process be amended to al-
low student representation 
on the Presidential Search 
Committee. We also pro-
posed the idea of the cre-
ation of a student advisory 
body as a short-term solu-
tion and more engagement 
with the Board of Trustees 
at both undergraduate and 
graduate levels to ensure 
shared governance.
These simple requests 
for further student involve-
ment were reiterated in 
numerous communications 
with the Search Committee  
—  both over email and in 
two meetings. However, 
the Committee has taken 
none of these requests seri-
ously. 
In the absence of any 
meaningful dialogue on 
student involvement, these 
meetings look like nothing 
more than a poor attempt 
at checking boxes. 
While the Search Com-
mittee was meeting with 
a few student leaders to

Sniping threat at CMU shocks many after deadly shooting at Florida high school
AISHA HAN
Contributing Editor
On Feb. 14, the United 
States experienced one 
of the deadliest school 
shootings in its history. 
Nikolas Cruz, armed with 
an AR-15 semiautomatic 
assault rifle and magazines 
of ammunition, opened 
fire in the hallways of Mar-
jory Stoneman Douglas 
High School in Parkland, 
Florida. 
According to The New 
York Times, Cruz arrived at 
the school shortly before 
dismissal time via an Uber, 
and made his way towards 
the freshman building. 
Cruz shot at people in the 
hallways and in five class-
rooms on the first and sec-
ond floors. He discarded 
his weapons on the third 
floor and fled the scene. As 
of Feb. 18, the death toll is 
17 people: 14 students and 
3 faculty members. Cruz is 
currently facing 17 counts 
of premeditated murder 
and is being held without 
bond at the main Broward 
County jail.
The incident in Florida 
especially hit home this 
week, as Carnegie Mellon 
faced a credible online 
threat by a student indi-
cating a desire to go onto 
a roof with a sniper rifle. 
The email threat, sent to an 
internal Carnegie Mellon 
University web platform, 
contained threatening 
rhetoric possibly copied 
from a post on Reddit, an 
online discussion board, 
and pasted without further 
context. A Carnegie Mellon 
University professor, upon 
discovering the threat, 
immediately notified the 
police. 
The Carnegie Mellon 
undergraduate is facing 
misdemeanor charges for 
making terroristic threats, 
and was removed from 
campus. With a misde-
meanor level offense, the 
student was charged by 
summons. He was not ar-
rested but, according to 
an email from Interim 
President Farnam Jahanian, 
has been “removed from 
our community,” and is 
currently not being held in 
jail.

Unprecedented ?ve CMU professors win Sloan Fellowship
ADAM TUNNARD
Staffwriter 
This past Thursday, Carnegie 
Mellon announced that five fac-
ulty members had been awarded 
the prestigious Sloan Research 
Fellowship. Sloan Founda-
tion president Adam Falk, via a 
Carnegie Mellon press release, 
described fellows as “the bright-
est minds, tackling the hardest 
problems, and succeeding bril-
liantly — fellows are quite liter-
ally the future of 21st century 
science.”
The Sloan Research Fellow-
ship is a unique opportunity 
for early-career researchers of 
Chemistry, Computational and 
Evolutionary, Biology Molecu-
lar Biology, Computer Science, 
Economics, Mathematics, Neu-
roscience, Ocean Science, and 
Physics. In addition to the pres-
tige, the Sloan Foundation, 
who awards the Fellowship, 
gives lump sums of $65,000 to 
winners, with very few strings 
attached.
As one might expect, the 
competition for such an award 
is fierce. The award can be used 
for anything that will further 
the research of early-career, 
distinguished scientists, and 
since its creation, it has been a 
contested and selective award. 
Over 700 researchers were nom-
inated by their institutions this 
year for just 126 fellowships.
In order to be considered, 
one must be on track to receive 
tenure at a degree-granting in-
stitution, hold a Ph.D in one of 
the aforementioned disciplines, 
and have received it after Sept. 
1, 2011. The applicant must also 
show strong ability to do inde-
pendent research, and be in the 
beginning of their career.
In past years, Carnegie 
Mellon University has received 
far fewer Sloan Research Fellow-
ships, averaging just under two a 
year. Receiving five fellowships 
in one year is a feat that has nev-
er been achieved by Carnegie 
Mellon faculty since the award’s 
inception in 1955.
50 Carnegie Mellon 
University faculty have been 
granted the fellowship since 
1955. This year, five top campus 
scientists join this prestigious 
list. They come from different 
backgrounds and study a myr-
iad of subjects but are now all 
members of a very select, elite 
group of scientists.
Venkat Viswanathan, an 
assistant professor of Mechani-
cal Engineering, researches en-
ergy storage and battery tech-
nology, with goals of innovating 
a more sustainable economy. He 
received his Ph.D from Stanford 
University and joined the 
Carnegie Mellon faculty shortly 
after in 2014.
Assistant professor of 
Computational Biology 
Andreas Pfenning is studying 
computational and experimen-
tal genomic techniques, with 
a goal of understanding how 
speech developed and under-
standing Alzheimer’s disease. 
He received his Ph.D from Duke 
University, and joined Carnegie 
Mellon faculty in 2016 after 
post-doctoral research jointly 
with Harvard Medical School 
and Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology.

professor of Computer Science, 
studies database management 
systems and large-scale data

understand what we sought 
in a new President, a re-
port had already appeared 
in The San Diego Union 
Tribune proving this was 
all a pretense. The report 
stated the Committee had 
already made an unsuccess-
ful attempt to recruit the 
Chancellor of University of 
California San Diego for the 
position of Carnegie Mel-
lon’s next president. 
If the Committee was al-
ready attempting to recruit 
someone, it’s fair to assume 
they knew what qualities 
they wanted in the new 
president, without student 
input. What, then, was the 
purpose of those meetings?
It is important to re-em-
phasize that universities are 
places of higher learning 
which would not exist with-
out students. When choos-
ing someone to lead these 
universities, it should be a 
no-brainer that each of the 
university’s constituencies 
should have a voice in the 
process. 
We understand that the 
addition of a few students 
on the Search Committee 
may not accurately re?ect 
the entirety of experience of 
this 13,961-member strong 
constituency. But surely, it 
will be better than having 
no students on the Commit-
tee. 
Current students would 
bring a lived student 
experience and a fresh per-
spective to the committee 
that no other group could 
bring. However, those call-
ing the shots decided this 
important voice is not wor-
thy of inclusion in the deci-
sion-making process. 
Some are concerned 
that, by opening the pro-
cess to students, they 
would also have to invite 
other stakeholders, such as 
non-university residents of 
Pittsburgh. This is an egre-
gious argument, as students 
are key stakeholders in the 
Carnegie Mellon communi-
ty. Stated concerns, such as 
con?dentiality or capping 
the committee size are con-
descending and show a lack 
of respect for our student 
body. In fact, the question 
of whether or not this pro-
cess should be secret is an 
open one that merits a dif-
ferent debate altogether.
While many forward 
looking universities have 
progressed from this an-
tiquated search process, 
Carnegie Mellon seems to 
be caught in a slumber —
snoozing and refusing to 
wake up.
A noteworthy example is 
Harvard University, which 
has recently completed its 
29th Presidential Search 
with the help of an 18-mem-
ber student advisory board. 
This is not as recent a devel-
opment as members of the 
Carnegie Mellon Board of 
Trustees would have you be-
lieve; Harvard ?rst included 
students more than a de-
cade ago in their 2006 Pres-
idential Search. And Har-
vard is not alone. Princeton 
opened up the process al-
most three decades ago in 
their 1989 search, and Stan-
ford opened it up in 1999.
The Presidential Search 
Process at Carnegie Mellon 
is “led by the Board of 
Trustees, in collaboration 
with the Faculty Senate.” 
The Search Committee is 
comprised of equal repre-
sentation from the Board 
of Trustees and the Faculty. 
The leadership of the com-
mittee is also split between 
the two bodies. 
Given this reality, the 
blame for excluding the 
students from the Search 
Committee should also be 
split between the Board and 
the members of the Faculty. 
At the time of writing, there 
has been no public en-
dorsement of student rep-
resentation in the Search 
Committee by the Faculty 
Senate or faculty members 
of the committee — just si-
lence and passing the buck 
to the Board of Trustees. 
Assuming that the 
decision on composition 
of the search committee 
rests solely with the Board, 
we would like to ask the 
Faculty Senate to weigh in 
on this debate and clarify 
whether they believe the 
search process and the 
Board of Trustees should 
have greater student par-
ticipation.
For a university that 
prides itself on decentral-
ization and shared gover-
nance, Carnegie Mellon 
fails to let some constitu-
encies, namely students 
and staff, participate in 
key conversations. Without 
a better model for shared 
governance with students, 
what avenues do we have 
for improving the Carnegie 
Mellon experience for 
ourselves and those who 
come next?
Gina Casalegno, Vice 
President for Student Af-
fairs and Dean of Students, 
reviewed the protocols of 
Carnegie Mellon University 
security when it comes 
to threats on campus in a 
statement to The Tartan. 
“No threat of physical harm 
to members of our com-
munity is acceptable... the 
stakes are too high,” she 
said in an email to The Tar-
tan, “If we learn of a poten-
tial threat to this communi-
ty, we work in consultation 
with law enforcement to 
immediately assess any 
risk. If we believe our com-
munity is in danger, we will 
use our emergency noti?-
cation system, employing 
text, cell phone, and loud-
speakers to instruct mem-
bers of our community how 
to be safe.”
This year marks a 
gruesome year for gun 
violence in this country. 
According to The New 
York Times, three of the 10 
deadliest mass shootings 
in modern United States 
history have come in the 
last ?ve months. Among 
them are the Florida shoot-
ing this week, the Las Vegas 
massacre at the Harvest 
Music Festival where 58 
attendees were killed, and 
the Texas Baptist church 
shooting in Sutherland 
Springs that claimed 26 
lives. 
All three of these shoot-
ings have one commonal-
ity: the gunmen used as-
sault ri?es to commit their 
crimes. None of the FBI’s 
Instant Criminal Back-
ground Check Systems 
indicated that Cruz and 
the Texas gunman should 
be barred from owning 
?rearms, despite their 
histories of agitation and 
misconduct.
The events contribute 
to a historically conten-
tious debate on gun control 
between Democrats and 
Republicans, especially 
surrounding the availabili-
ty of semi-automatic weap-
ons such as the one Cruz 
used. Assault ri?es like the 
AK-47 and AR-15 are rela-
tively easy to acquire given 
their price and usability. 
Variants of the AR-15 
were used in the mass kill-
ings of the movie theater 
in Aurora, Colorado, and 
Sandy Hook Elementary 
School in 2012. Addition-
ally, according to The New 
York Times, there is little 
regulation on retro?tted 
accessories, such as the 
bumpstock the Las Vegas 
festival shooter used that 
harnessed recoil to ac-
celerate a semi-automatic 
ri?e’s rate of ?re. Accord-
ing to law enforcement, the 
AR-15 Cruz used was pur-
chased legally a year ago at 
Sunrise Tactical Supply in 
Florida.
Despite having un-
precedented rates of gun 
violence among the most 
developed countries, the 
U.S. has done little to com-
bat the problem. In fact, 
according to Everytown 
for Gun Safety, the num-
ber of gun deaths has in-
creased in the past years; 
gun deaths rose by 5,000 
between the years 2012 
and 2016. U.S. Congress 
is gridlocked on whether 
tightening measures of gun 
control is constitutional, 
despite frequent outcries of 
harsher measures and uni-
versal background checks 
after devastating incidents 
such as the Florida school 
shooting. Given previous 
cases of school shootings, it 
is possible that the follow-
ing debates on gun control 
in the legislature will not 
lead to momentous gun re-
form.
You can help out the vic-
tims of the Florida school 
shooting by donating to 
the Stoneman Douglas 
Victims’ Fund at https://
www.gofundme.com/stone-
mandouglasvictimsfund. 
Proceeds will go directly 
to the families affected by 
the event, and will cover 
funeral and medical ex-
penses. Please beware of 
fraudulent accounts that 
may pose as funds for the 
victims.
Lastly, the recent 
Carnegie Mellon University 
incident is a reminder of 
the chilling reality of gun 
violence in America. Edu-
cational institutions should 
take extra precautions. If 
you see something suspi-
cious, do not hesitate to 
contact authorities. 
Vice President Gina 
Casalegno advised that 
“these episodes may be a 
good occasion for all of us 
to spend time re-familiariz-
ing ourselves with universi-
ty resources and guidance 
about staying safe.” She 
recommended reviewing 
The Word: Student Hand-
book’s section on emergen-
cies and emergency noti-
?cations and safety tips 
on active shooters on the 
University Police’s website, 
both of which can be found 
at cmu.edu, before ?nally 
stating she was “deeply 
grateful to the expertise 
and care of our University 
Police Department every 
day in assuring our com-
munity’s safety.”
analytics. After getting 
his Ph.D from Brown 
University in 2013, he 
joined the Computer 
Science Department at 
Carnegie Mellon.
Jointly appointed in 
both the Computer Science 
Department and the Elec-
trical and Computer En-
gineering Department, 
assistant professor Bryan 
Parno studies the design 
and creation of secure sys-
tems. He received his Ph.D 
from Carnegie Mellon 
University and was named 
a top 30 scientist under 30 
by Forbes in 2011.
Assistant professor 
in the Human-Comput-
er Interaction Institute 
Chris Harrison also di-
rects the Future Interfaces 
Group, which researches 
sensing and interaction 
techniques in relation to 
mobile devices and touch 
interfaces. He received 
his Ph.D from Carnegie 
Mellon University, and 
was also named a top 
30 scientist under 30 by 
Forbes in 2012, in addi-
tion to other awards.
All of the described 
Carnegie Mellon faculty 
do impactful and 
innovative research that 
will shape the future 
of our world. Their 
accomplishments so early 
in their career are sub-
lime and indicative of the 
forward-thinking work 
of Carnegie Mellon re-
searchers. Carnegie Mel-
lon University is certainly 
lucky to have these profes-
sors all on campus, teach-
ing and researching, and 
there is sure to be a lot to 
look forward to in terms 
of what they pursue with 
the force and the funding

Jingoism in the Olympics is a necessary evil
Why do we watch the Olym-
pic Games?
Every four years, the Olym-
pics, summer and winter, come 
and go. We hear the loud drum 
of NBC’s Olympics musical 
theme. We watch sports that 
we’ve never heard of and we 
fall in love with athletes we 
don’t hear about for another 
four years. We get wrapped up 
in a national fervor, as if all the 
millions of people watching feel 
the same happiness or disap-
pointment. There’s something 
magical about the Olympics: 
the human stories, the dreams 
coming true (or crashing to a 
halt), and the national pride.
But if dig a little deeper, 
and these feelings of hope and 
joy and pride can start to feel a 
little contrived. These athletes 
around the world have dedi-
cated their lives to their sport 
— nothing can or should be 
taken away from that. But af-
ter watching heavily-produced, 
tear-inducing athlete pieces (by 
NBC in the United States), these 
tactics can feel manipulative. 
After watching NBC cut events 
from the main broadcast 
because there are not 
any Americans com-
peting, after hear-
ing commentators 
rave on and on 
about American 
athletes without 
much notice to 
the other athletes, 
after we ourselves 
feed into this na-
tionalism through 
social media, pa-
triotism can bleed to 
jingoism, the type of 
nationalism that be-
comes chauvinistic, fa-
natical, and belligerent.
The ancient Olym-
pics, which began no later 
than 776 B.C., was a sport-
ing event held in 
Olympia, Greece, to 
celebrate the Greek 
Olympian gods. In 
1896, the modern 
Olympics was re-
vived by French noble 
Pierre de Coubertin 
to promote a physical 
education program. It 
is also a symbol of uni-
ty among the countries 
of the world. Despite 
this second purpose, 
the Olympics through-
out history have been 
ripe for political con-
troversy, with po-
litical antagonism 
between different 
countries bleeding 
into the Games, 
and these events 
being used as 
propaganda 
to show off 
the might of 
individual 
countries.
The 1936 Sum-
mer Olympics in 
Berlin was a per-
fect tool for this 
type of propagan-
da, feeding into the 
nationalist agenda 
of Hitler and Nazi 
Germany. The boycotts 
of the 1980 and 1984 Sum-
mer Olympics in Moscow and 
Los Angeles, respectively, mir-
rored the Cold War animosity 
between the United States and 
the Soviet Union. Even one of 
the greatest moments in Olym-
pic history (for Americans), the 
“Miracle on Ice”, cannot be di-
vorced from the context of the 
Cold War.
The jingoism of the Olym-
pics is a necessary evil. They 
give countries an outlet to 
flex their muscles, to present 
the best of their best, to one-
up of other countries without 
bloodshed. Before (and after) 
1896, countries mainly exerted 
power over each other through 
war, conquest, and colonial-
ism. This continued in the 20th 
century after the revival of the 
Olympics, but as independence 
movements spread around the 
world in the latter half of the 
century, the Olympics became 
an even more important way for 
countries to showcase their su-
periority. Athletic competition, 
no matter how patriotically it is 
broadcast, is a far better alter-
native than violent imperialism, 
though imperialism does still 
exist today (albeit in a slightly 
evolved version).
This potentially harmful 
nationalist perspective is not 
developed solely through 
NBC’s coverage of the 
Olympics. We are 
part of the prob-
lem. We scream 
the “U! S! A!” 
chant. We 
provide 
fodder 
for 
other 
countries 
to resent 
our obnox-
ious bravado, 
our air of supe-
riority. In the 2016 
Summer Olympics in Rio de Ja-
neiro, American swimmer Lily 
King took issue with Russian 
competitor Yulia Yefimova’s 
history with performance en-
hancing drugs. King defeated 
Yefimova for the gold and told 
reporters that she believed ath-
letes with histories of doping 
should be barred form compe-
tition. Twitter immediately ex-
ploded with celebratory memes 
and jokes at Yefimova’s expense. 
Generations of negative feelings 
about Russians came out, as 
they are wont to do whenever 
they are given the chance. The 
use of performance enhancing 
drugs and how governing bod-
ies address it is a serious one, 
but keyboard-happy people 
turned it into a funnel of one-
sided patriotism.
Sometimes, however, the 
Olympics have fulfilled their 
original purpose, uniting coun-
tries and their citizens as the 
world watches. During the 
Olympics, we often see athletes 
from different countries con-
gratulating each other, celebrat-
ing a healthy competitive spirit. 
We have witnessed powerful 
moments of hope and strength 
that transcended national 
boundaries: Britain’s Derek 
Redmond’s race finish, Kerri 
Strug’s one-foot landing, the 
Black Power Salute of Tom-
mie Smith and John Carlos. 
In the opening ceremony 
of the 2000 Summer Olym-
pics in Sydney, the athletes 
of North and South Korea 
marched together. This also 
happened in the opening 
ceremony of the current 
Winter Olympics in 
PyeongChang, 
South Korea, 
although the 
motivations 
for this at-
tempt at 
unity have 
been met 
with some 
skepticism.
In its es-
sence, the 
Olympics ul-
timately serve 
as a form of 
entertainment, a 
way to bring a family 
together around a televi-
sion. It’s fun to learn about un-
familiar sports and unfamiliar 
countries, to watch people do 
things we could never do before 
our very eyes, and it’s truly 
inspiring to see athletes fight 
through adversity in pursuit of 
their dreams. We experience 
the Olympic spirit that we hope 
to carry on in our own lives. But 
as we watch enthusiastically 
from our couches, as we yell and 
scream and cry and cheer, let’s 
remember to watch with our 
minds as well as our hearts, and 
take it all in with a grain of salt.

Literature is meant to be a 
lens through which we view 
the world. It’s not the only lens, 
by any means, but it’s one that 
is ingrained in our education 
systems and in our daily lives. 
From a young age, we learn 
about classic stories — books 
that everyone knows to some 
degree: Romeo and Juliet or An-
imal Farm, for instance. Books 
that have themes that res-
onate with all of us in 
their own ways, even 
if we’ve never read 
them. They’re em-
bedded in our ev-
eryday conversa-
tions naturally.
These books 
are important. 
They contain uni-
versal ideas and still 
have so much value 
today, but they aren’t 
enough. They don’t reflect 
the realities of people’s 
lives today, of a 
world with 
everything 
from smart-
phones 
to police 
brutality. 
There’s an 
implicit 
idea that 
the past is 
somehow more 
whole and purer; 
therefore, we should look back 
for ideas. Modern books, espe-
cially the books that become 
our pop culture moments 
that are usually geared 
towards teenagers, are 
meant to be thought as 
being on the opposing 
end of the spectrum 
from classic books. 
One holds the secrets 
of humanity, the other 
is bite-sized bits of col-
orful fluff, stories of teen 
angst and vampires.
Here’s the thing: pop cul-
ture moments reflect the world 
around us. Espe-
cially in the 
U.S., these 
books say 
important 
things 
about 
the state 
of our 
country. 
This is 
especially 
important in 
the context of 
diverse books. The 
publishing industry began to 
truly focus on diversity over 
the last few years, which has 
resulted in a dazzling array of 
main characters. There are sto-
ries with people of color dis-
played front and center on their 
covers, books about LGBTQ+ 
characters and relationships, 
and books featuring characters 
with disabilities that don’t just 
use them as a plot function. 
These are books meant to share 
experiences that go beyond the 
basic narrative, and help people 
empathize with others and also 
examine features of their own 
lives.
The viewpoint that mod-
ern books don’t have the same 
weight as classics undermines 
the necessity to keep using lit-
erature as a way to understand 
the present and not just the 
past. It’s important to respect 
and reflect on the realities of to-
day, of stories that are anchored 
to the world we live in at the 
moment. This past week, the 
American Library Association 
announced its annual awards. 
These are the awards that result 
in the shiny metallic stickers on 
the cover of books, books that 
many of us read when 
we were younger, 
and continue 
to read to-
day. The 
most in-
teresting 
award is 
the Wil-
liam Mor-
ris Award, 
which is 
given to a 
debut author 
in young adult 
literature. The fi-
nalists this year were diverse 
in theme and scope, ad-
dressing everything 
from Islamophobia 
to race-based police 
brutality. These 
are books that dis-
cuss topics that 
aren’t covered by 
classic books, and 
showcase narratives 
that are often forgot-
ten. The finalists of that 
competition may now bear 
that shiny medal, 
but it’s impor-
tant that we 
still respect 
them 
and their 
peers 
even 
without 
those 
awards.
There’s 
a tendency 
to dimin-
ish things that 
are geared towards 
young people. It’s the same rea-
son there are a million think 
pieces that bash millenni-
als for avocado toast. We 
mock things that are 
new, that deviate from 
the known path. How-
ever, these dif-
ferent stories 
and perspec-
tives are so im-
portant to recog-
nize. They explore 
themes that aren’t 
yet part of the public 
consciousness in the way 
that classics are.
Literature is an important 
tool for sharing perspectives 
and ideas. It doesn’t have to be 
limited to a set of old books. We 
should follow the lead of the 
American Library Association 
and seek out excellence in the 
books that are coming out, that 
push the boundaries of what 
we know and expect. So many 
books that we learn about in 
school vary from the experienc-
es people go through in real life. 
We need to incorporate stories 
that students can truly relate to 
and deal with the themes that 
they think about. As we con-
tinue to challenge our societal 
norms and ideas, literature will 
only serve to help.
Modern books re?ect the realities of society
[The jingoism of 
the Olymipcs] 
give countries 
an outlet to ?ex 
their muscles, to 
present the best 
of their best, to 
one-up other 
countries without 
bloodshed.

Yet again, America finds itself 
in a heated debate over gun vio-
lence. Senator Marco Rubio (R-
FL) summarized the right’s gen-
eral consensus on gun control 
by stating that increasing gun 
control regulations would be in-
effective because someone who 
wants to commit shootings “will 
find a way to get the gun to do 
it.” Conversely, Senator Kamala 
Harris (D-CA) demanded “smart 
gun safety laws” and for us to 
“[not] tolerate a society and live 
in a country with any level of 
pride when our babies are being 
slaughtered.”
No sensible person would 
look at a tragedy like the one in 
Parkland, FL and wish for such 
an incident to happen again. 
People on both ends of the gun 
control debate generally hold 
their respective views because 
they genuinely believe that the 
way to lessen gun violence is 
through their respective beliefs. 
Although this core intention may 
be similar across the spectrum, 
it often gets lost in the pathos-
driven “debates” we see. We still 
have far to go in terms of initiat-
ing fruitful dialogue, listening, 
and creating solutions.
Already, there are attempts 
to change policies in wake of the 
Marjory Stoneman Douglas High 
School shooting. Alabama has 
already introduced legislation 
allowing educators to carry 
firearms. State Representa-
tive Will Ainsworth echoed 
Rubio’s sentiment, saying 
“more gun control will 
not stop someone who is 
intent upon inflicting 
harm in our schools, 
but someone who is 
properly trained and 
armed with the right 
equipment certain-ly 
can.” Educators in the 
state had requested he 
introduce such a bill, 
showing that he is not 
alone in believ-ing 
that increasing 
arms within 
schools will 
prevent an-
other school 
shooting. 
Meanwhile, the left is clamor-
ing and demanding tighter gun 
regulations, so much that po-
litical commentator Tomi Lahren 
tweeted “Can the Left let the 
families grieve for even 24 hours 
before they push their anti-gun 
and anti-gunowner agenda?... 
This isn’t about a gun it’s about 
another lunatic.” However, she 
has yet to make such a statement 
towards Ainsworth and his use 
of the shooting to “push his pro-
gunowner agenda.” This kind of 
shutdown of dialogue to project 
one’s own opinion further polar-
izes the two sides, making the 
chance of actually striking a so-
lution even smaller.
Another common facet of the 
argument about gun violence is 
the “mental health” versus “gun 
control” mentality people seem 
to have. President Donald Trump, 
in response to the Sutherland 
Springs, TX church shooting in 
2017, said that the problem “isn’t 
a guns situation...[it’s] a mental 
health problem at the highest 
level.” On the other end of 
the spectrum, we find voices 
shifting the blame solely to gun 
regulation. This kind of men-
tality treats the problem of gun 
violence as if there can only be 
one cause. A need for reform in 
gun regulations is not mutually 
exclusive to a need for a reform 
in how America handles mental 
health, yet saying the problem 
lies in one area or another im-
plies just that. Of course, there 
are people in the middle who 
think that the problem lies in be-
tween these two poles, or some 
new pole altogether. However, 
the prominent voices appear to 
be these two ends. If we want to 
get any closer to finding a solu-
tion to the prevalence of gun vio-
lence in America, we have to rec-
ognize all — meaning anywhere 
from one to infinity — factors 
that contribute.
Finally, we need to stop be-
lieving in this sentiment: “num-
bers don’t lie.” Quantifiable data 
can effectively strengthen ethos 
in one’s argument, but we must 
consider the context in which 
we draw the numbers from. 
For instance, when pro-
gun regulators bring 
up countries such as 
South Korea and 
their respec-
tive statis-
tics to 
sup-
port their gun-regulation thesis, 
what the statistics fail to men-
tion is that South Korea does 
not have the “gun culture,” if 
you will, that exists in America. 
America is founded so heavily on 
the notion that gun ownership is 
a right, in no small part thanks to 
the Second Amendment and the 
reinforcement of the belief that 
guns are important to everyday 
people. Furthermore, guns are 
almost integrated into American 
culture; we live in a country in 
which a man in Decatur, AL can 
legally promote his roofing com-
pany by offering a free gun per 
roof and where a man can legally 
carry his AR-15 and walk into 
the terminal of Hartsfield-Jack-
son Atlanta Airport — the busi-
est airport in the world — with 
no legal consequences. However, 
none of this would be fathom-
able in countries such as South 
Korea. Hearing someone owns a 
gun would raise a few eyebrows 
there; in America, not so much. 
Thus, simply installing Korea’s 
gun laws into America would not 
work. People in Korea have their 
optimal strategy: “given hardly 
anybody has a gun, I don’t need 
one either.” America lacks this 
given statement, thus our opti-
mal strategy looks more like this: 
“given anyone around me proba-
bly has a gun, I might need one.”
Alternatively, those who claim 
that guns don’t make a society 
deadlier and bring up numbers 
to support this claim also fall 
guilty of believing “numbers 
don’t lie.” Conservative 
political commentator 
Steven Crowder 
has been a con-
sistent op-
ponent 
of gun 
reg-
ulations and throws in numbers 
to support his claims. However, 
about half of his sources for his 
video “’Common Sense’ Gun 
Control Debunked! (Man-On-
Street)!” were biased, leaning 
against gun regulation. Con-
cepts such as p-hacking, where 
researchers select data that will 
provide them the results that 
they desire, are no stranger to 
the natural sciences, never mind 
the social sciences. Although 
Crowder did put two govern-
ment websites, an overwhelm-
ing portion of his information 
came from less credible sources. 
Furthermore, the right bringing 
up countries such as Switzer-
land, which has one of the high-
est gun ownership rates in the 
world, to argue America doesn’t 
have a gun problem is also naive 
at best. Switzerland takes gun 
ownership more seriously than 
America does. Whereas guns 
are often handed down in the 
US or given as gifts, the people 
in Switzerland are cognizant 
of the responsibility owning a 
gun entails. Qualities such as 
discipline, mandatory military 
service, awareness of the grav-
ity of gun ownership, and more 
accessible healthcare all contrib-
ute; simply installing their gun 
ownership statistics to America 
without considering other cul-
tural aspects would not work.
I understand such 
controversial topics such as gun 
control will not have a clean so-
lution. Regardless of whatever 
is enacted, there will be many 
people disappointed. However, 
the fact that we cannot satisfy 
everyone — or even the major-
ity of America — should not 
discourage us from having these 
difficult discussions. Although 
we should not detach from emo-
tions altogether, we need to 
learn to have these discussions 
without making others feel as 
though they are attacked 
or allowing ourselves to 
feel attacked.

Sacred Heart Greenwich, 
a private Catholic school in 
Greenwich, CT, informed 16-year 
old student Kate Murray on Feb. 
6 that if she did not remove her 
Planned Parenthood sticker from 
her laptop, she would be forced 
to leave the school either imme-
diately or at the end of her aca-
demic year. Hundreds of alumnae 
of the high school spoke out, call-
ing or writing to their alma mater 
to discuss their thoughts on the is-
sue and voicing their disappoint-
ment. In addition to voicing their 
outrage on the situation, some 
even called out the institution on 
Sacred Heart’s policies and over-
all environment through social 
media platforms. But no matter 
the response that these young 
women had towards it, I would 
bet that nearly all the alumnae, 
especially younger ones like my-
self, were all shocked and a little 
shaken.
Murray’s possible expulsion 
not only caught the attention of 
my town’s local paper, but also 
the attention of The New York 
Times, Washington Post, USA To-
day, and even prominent British 
newspapers such as The Daily 
Mail and The Independent. And 
as I watched my alma mater get 
thrust in an unwanted and un-
needed spotlight for 15 minutes of 
fame last week, I started to think 
more about my Sacred Heart ex-
perience, a time where people 
were already heavily pushed to 
excel in school and speak up to-
wards injustice either within Sa-
cred Heart or among the outside 
world. We should have pushed, or 
been pushed, more.
This is not the ?rst time my 
high school has gotten into a 
larger fuss over, at their core, very 
small and petty situations. How-
ever, these were mostly dealt with 
internally and swiftly, becoming a 
gust in school culture and gossip 
for a short period of time. Mur-
ray’s possible expulsion — “an 
extreme reaction to a very small 
sticker” — was a hurricane, and 
Sacred Heart was unprepared. 
Murray’s “very small sticker” 
came up in discussion around the 
town of Greenwich, and Sacred 
Heart’s initial press responses felt 
too mechanical.
Sacred Heart ?nally came to 
the conclusion to allow Murray 
to attend Sacred 
Heart Green-
wich with her 
Planned Parent-
hood sticker last 
Monday and 
is now “form-
ing a working 
group to facili-
tate a transpar-
ent, thorough 
examination of 
the environment 
for independent 
thinking and the 
articulate ex-
pression of ideas 
within our cur-
riculum and stu-
dent life” made 
up of members 
of the school 
community that 
aims to “exam-
ine the clarity, 
consistency and appropriateness 
of [Sacred Heart]’s policies re-
garding personal expression,“ ac-
cording to the Sacred Heart web-
site. It is an acknowledgment that 
activism is alive and well within 
the Sacred Heart environment, 
and that maybe their goal to be a 
school “where young women be-
come global leaders” is happen-
ing at a quicker pace than they 
thought it was. It is an acknowl-
edgment of their faults and their 
efforts to regain favor within 
their community. It is an effort to 
facilitate a new stronger strain of 
activism within their 731-student 
body. It is an acknowledgment of 
the sharp cultural divide between 
abortion and the Catholic faith. 
But, it is also an acknowledgment 
on the power and necessity of 
change within their environment, 
and a realization that Sacred 
Heart needs to continue to nur-
ture their students’ passion and 
energy to 
?ght for what they believe 
in.
Within the span of a mere 
few days, the Marjory Stoneman 
Douglas High School has gener-
ated enough passion and energy 
to fuel their state, and it is already 
being cultivated with quick inten-
sity. Students and survivors of 
Wednesday’s horri?c shooting re-
fuse to back down on their support 
for stricter gun control laws, and 
already have a battle plan on how 
to show it. The students started a 
rally in Fort Lauderdale last Sat-
urday and Florida-based South 
Broward High School staged a 
walkout last Friday to voice their 
support, thus kicking off a sched-
ule of several walkouts, protests, 
and rallies all across the country 
that support stricter gun control. 
The two most notable walkouts 
planned are one occurring March 
14, which would mark the school 
shooting’s one 
month anni-
versary and 
is co-hosted 
by Women’s 
March; and 
one occurring 
on April 20, 
which would 
mark the 19th 
anniversary of 
the Columbine 
High School 
massacre. They 
are encourag-
ing people to 
vote against 
politicians funded by the National 
Ri?e Association, and have called 
out Trump and his administra-
tion to demand change to current 
legislation and to offer more than 
just thoughts and prayers.
As of now, Carnegie Mellon’s 
landmark, the Fence is painted 
in all white with #MeToo written 
on its posts. Besides advertising 
club events and celebrating com-
munity pride, the Fence has also 
become a place to show support 
of important social causes and 
to cherish diverse opinions. This 
is just one of the many ways that 
Carnegie Mellon nurtures social 
activism and discussion, and in 
the wake of national division, 
high schools need to do the same. 
Activism has become necessary, 
and debates on topics such as gun 
control and abortion are becom-
ing increasingly harder to avoid. 
There will be some instances 
where it will require regulation. 
Sometimes, there will need to 
be an established order, good 
planning, and moral boundaries 
on protesting and speaking your 
mind. But in our current adminis-
tration, activism seems to be real-
ly the only way anything will ever 
get done and should be motivated 
and taught alongside.
High school student and 
survivor Emma Gonzalez re-
marked that “it is time for victims 
to be the change we need to see” 
during Saturday’s rally. In Sandy 
Hook, these are elementary 
school children and their 
parents. While 
not victims 
in the same 
sense, Sacred 
Heart students 
and alumnae are 
being incorporated into this 
group examining personal ex-
pression. But in Parkland, these 
are high school students. And 
if that’s the case, high schools 
should start building a stronger 
foundation in their students now 
to shape them into a better gen-
eration of representatives than 
what the nation currently has.
America needs more fruitful dialogue about gun violence
Cultivating social activism in high schools is necessary

Public education is unequal on local and regional levels
AISHA HAN
Contributing Editor
The U.S Commission on Civil 
Rights started off 2018 with 
a published report on public 
education funding inequity, a 100-
page brie?ng on the organization’s 
key ?ndings on public education 
in K-12 schools. The Commission 
majority found that “many 
students in the U.S. living in 
segregated neighborhoods and 
concentrations of poverty do not 
have access to high-quality schools 
simply because of where they live.” 
The problem, according to the 
commission’s report, is that too 
many schools remain segregated 
along racial and socioeconomic 
lines. Moreover, there are 
signi?cant disparities in school 
funding from state to state, district 
to district, and school to school. 
These disparities exacerbate the 
problems of struggling students, 
and research even shows that 
students living in poverty often 
show up to school needing extra 
help and extra resources. Secretary 
of Education Betsy DeVos, who 
has stated that “equal access to 
a quality education should be a 
right for every American,” has been consistently under ?re 
for school privatization efforts, 
putting a disproportionate amount 
of attention on charter school, 
private school, and religious 
school systems.
Perhaps her neglect of public 
school systems is rooted in the 
scope of its complications. Since the 
1954 court ruling of Brown v. Board 
of Education that public education 
is a “right which must be available 
on all equal terms,” racially 
segregated public school facilities 
have been unconstitutional. 
However historic the decision is, 
the ruling provided little guidance 
on how to desegregate schools, 
moreover on how to provide 
equal access to educational 
facilities across all socioeconomic 
and racial platforms. With little 
practical guidance and resistance 
to reinforce the law in the South, 
desegregation took decades to fully 
occur. The South’s segregation in 
housing policies exacerbated the 
problems black Americans faced 
as well, while efforts to change 
it, such as the 1968 Fair Housing 
Act, were palliative, piecemeal, 
and not thoroughly effective. As 
school enrollments changed, many 
predominantly minority schools 
experienced double de facto 
segregation, or segregation by both 
race and concentrated poverty. 
Because schools are largely 
funded by revenue generated 
from local property taxes, 
schools in poorer communities 
are often underfunded. This is 
part of a negative feedback loop 
that contributes to the “dropout 
factory,” where students in these 
communities face challenges in 
achievement, lower graduation 
rates, high teacher turnover, and 
instability of enrollment.
If the country is intent on 
?xing the existing side effects 
of school segregation and 
housing discrimination, the 
Commission provides a handful 
of recommendations to start. 
Among them is a need to develop 
a national standard for eliminating 
school segregation, and increase 
federal funding for desegregated 
school districts. This is a tricky 
suggestion in that precedence from 
court rulings such as San Antonio 
Independent School District v. 
Rodriguez Supreme Court declared 
that the federal government is 
not constitutionally obligated to 
provide public education. However, 
such decisions should be revisited, 
especially in the wake of a broken 
system of under-performing public 
schools overcome with poverty, 
and ?nancial disasters that struck 
poorer states the hardest. The 
longstanding and persistent reality 
is that the vast funding inequities 
in state public education systems 
are signi?cant in rendering the 
education available to millions of 
American public school students 
profoundly unequal.
In the end, the debate on 
equal funding for public schools is 
centered on whether the role of the 
federal government in providing 
resources to ensure equity on a 
state level is compulsory. However, 
what is indisputable is that the 
federal government granted that 
public education is a right which 
must be available on all equal 
terms. Implementation of that 
right has been insuf?cient since 
the Supreme Court’s declaration, 
and because the federal 
government has decided to act 
upon the precedence by enforcing 
desegregation by the 1970’s, it 
must ?nish its job by establishing 
long-term policies that will grant 
equal opportunities for all children 
in the public education system.
Hillary Clinton still faces scrutiny after presidential election

Hillary Clinton’s surprising 
loss in the 2016 presidential 
election still has not fully 
sunken in for me. Rather, 
Donald Trump’s “victory” still 
has not quite sunken in, even 
as we collectively begin to 
understand the complex array 
of circumstances that caused 
the upset. We know voter 
turnout played a huge role; 
Trump supporters showed up in 
droves while hesitant moderates 
and liberals dissatisfied with 
Clinton’s candidacy did not. We 
know that James Comey’s last-
second letter might have just 
given Trump the edge he needed 
to win. As important as it is to 
reckon with the significance 
of such a devastating outcome 
— with an egotistical, childish 
reality television star who has 
around 20 sexual harassment 
and assault allegations being 
elected leader of the free world 
— we must move forward in 
a way that is responsible in 
addressing the reasons Trump 
won and respectful of those left 
behind simultaneously.
For that reason, there is 
value to be found in examining 
the role of Hillary Clinton post-
election. Clinton kept busy, 
publishing a book about the 
election not even a year after 
her loss. Now, she has turned 
her focus to speaking at events, 
giving talks about the effect 
of climate change on women 
specifically.
And yet, she has faced 
heightened scrutiny for not 
disappearing completely. 
Historically, coverage of 
losing candidates following 
presidential elections has been 
scrutinizing. Media outlets 
famously covered Al Gore’s 
weight gain following his drawn 
out 2000 loss. But, none have 
faced the level of criticism 
Clinton has. Mitt Romney, 
who lost to President Obama 
in 2012, just announced a 
Senate bid to fairly widespread 
conservative fanfare (at least 
for conservatives disillusioned 
with Trump). Clinton went 
through the ringer during 
the election for a number of 
overblown scandals designed 
to vilify her. Some, like the 
disproved Benghazi scandal, 
were planned years in advance 
to tarnish her name. But 
she has continued to 
be Trump’s favorite 
Twitter target even 
now, with the 
election over a 
year behind us. 
This is not to say 
that she has 
not criticized 
the President, 
but then 
again she 
never tried to 
#lockhimup.
But some, 
including 
many 
liberals, take 
issue with 
her continued 
presence in 
the public 
sphere. Some 
think Clinton’s 
candidacy damaged 
the party and that 
Democrats should 
distance themselves from 
her in an effort to shake 
the narratives that made 2016 
such a disaster. Others think 
Clinton has been victimized and 
deserves retribution for her loss 
in an election where she won the 
popular vote by three million 
votes. Either way, Democrats 
are still divided, and that is 
especially troubling for a party 
that has an opportunity to take 
back the House and Senate this 
year at midterms. That division 
would certainly be heightened 
by a sudden reemergence of 
Clinton into electoral politics.
So then, how can Clinton 
contribute to a country she 
has devoted her entire life to 
improving? Some might suggest 
her taking on the speaker role 
more regularly. To others, she 
would be best served to work in 
higher education like former 
Vice President Joe Biden 
at the University 
of Pennsylvania. 
Beyond that, work 
in civics like that 
of the newly 
formed Obama 
Foundation 
might be a 
healthy way for 
Clinton to engage 
with supporters 
without drawing 
too much scrutiny 
from fellow 
Democrats. I 
do not believe 
that simply 
fading into 
obscurity is productive, or even 
realistic for Hillary Clinton. She 
has proven to be one of the more 
resilient politicians of modern 
times and has 
drawn much 
admiration for it. So does the 
future of the Democratic Party 
involve Clinton at the helm? No. 
The party needs to get younger 
and appeal to a broader base of 
voters. As we learned in 2008 
with the election of Barack 
Obama, the ability to mobilize 
voters from all sects of the 
population wins elections. 
Clinton did not do that and it 
was ultimately her downfall, 
but she has the opportunity 
to contribute to this country 
outside the electoral landscape. 
In the meantime, Democrats 
should look for a young leader 
to inspire young voters who 
are seriously disillusioned with 
Trump. As millennials become 
an increasingly large portion 
of the eligible electorate, 
Democrats should seek to 
appeal to them to aid their 
chances against an aging, 
shrinking Republican 
Party.

It makes for an image 
right out of science ?ction: a 
mannequin named Starman, 
driving a cherry red Tesla 
Roadster, with his arm set on 
the windowsill, en route to 
orbit Mars as “Space Oddity” 
by David Bowie plays on the 
radio. Elon Musk, founder 
and CEO of SpaceX and car 
company Tesla, and his latest 
stunt have reignited a long-
forgotten spirit to explore 
galaxies far, far away and 
meet life outside of Earth 
and someday, be able to ac-
tually drive sports cars, or 
their equivalents, in space.
On Feb. 6, SpaceX 
launched its Falcon Heavy 
rocket from the Kennedy 
LC-39A SpaceX Launch Site 
in Cape Canaveral, Florida, 
carrying Musk’s Tesla sports 
car. The Falcon Heavy is the 
most powerful operational 
rocket in the world, and can 
carry almost 64 metric tons 
of load. Only the Saturn 
V, last ?own in 1973, used 
to launch the Apollo series 
for manned missions to the 
moon, delivered more pay-
load than the Falcon Heavy.
The Falcon Heavy 
consists of three Falcon 9 
rockets strapped together; 
after the Feb. 6 launch, two 
of the three Falcon 9 rockets 
landed in sync on landing 
pads. The launch was meant 
to demonstrate the reusabil-
ity of SpaceX’s rockets — a 
system designed to signi?-
cantly lower the cost barriers 
of getting into space. 
At $90 million per ?ight, 
this system is signi?cantly 
cheaper than NASA’s heavy 
launch system — the Space 
Launch System — which is 
under planning, and is al-
ready estimated to cost about 
$1 billion per ?ight. Another 
competitor in the reusable 
rocket race is New Glenn, a 
project by Blue Origins — 
a private space?ight and 
aerospace company owned 
by entrepreneur Jeff Bezos, 
the founder of Amazon. The 
pace of this new space race 
seems to have been acceler-
ated by the privatization of 
space travel. Perhaps stunts 
like Musk’s are what drives 
the need to be faster, better 
and more visible in experi-
menting with space travel.
Musk’s Tesla Roadster 
will play the song “Space 
Oddity” on in?nite loop (or 
until the stereo’s battery 
runs out) while in space, has 
“Don’t Panic” written on the 
center of its dashboard, and 
has “Made on Earth by Hu-
mans” written on a circuit 
board. The fact that there 
is no air to carry sound in 
space, and that “Don’t Panic” 
is a particularly cheeky liter-
ary reference to Douglas Ad-
ams’ novels, show that this 
is clearly an exhibit meant 
for humans, not extraterres-
trials. The car also has Isaac 
Asimov’s Foundation trilogy 
stored in a storage device, 
a miniature model of the 
car with Starman in it and 
the names of about 6,000 
SpaceX employees marked 
on the actual car.
The car was supposed to 
orbit Mars, but overshot its 
aim and now, after surviving 
the Earth’s radiation-?lled 
Van Allen belts, it’s headed 
for the asteroid belts. 
Scienti?cally speaking, 
the car is a dummy payload: 
it has no real scienti?c pur-
pose. This is intentional. In 
response to a tweet asking 
what the Falcon Heavy’s pay-
load was going to be, Musk 
said that it would be the “sil-
liest thing we can imagine!” 
While it is a matter of 
taste whether launching his 
personal $250,000 Tesla 
Roadster was “silly,” it de?-
nitely was memorable.
In a press conference 
on Feb. 6, Musk said, “Nor-
mally, for a new rocket, it 
launches like a block of con-
crete, and that’s so boring. 
The imagery of [the car and 
Starman] is something that’s 
going to get people excited 
around the world … and it’s 
still tripping me out….May-
be it’ll be discovered by some 
future alien race thinking, 
‘What the heck were these 
guys doing, did they worship 
this car? Why do they have a 
little car in the car?’ That’ll 
really confuse them.”

What does it mean to drive a Tesla Roadster in space?
Scientists study spread of ?u across college campuses
EMMA FLICKINGER
Assistant SciTech Editor
Getting sick with the 
?u can disrupt your entire 
schedule. Yet sick students 
still regularly show up to 
class, work, and meetings, 
potentially putting every-
one around them at risk 
for illness. You might ?nd 
yourself heading to the 
doctor’s of?ce because of a 
classmate — or was it your 
roommate? Or your teach-
ing assistant? Or someone 
you sat next to on the bus?
When viruses are going 
around campus, it can be 
hard to tell who was to 
blame, especially if many 
people are sick at the 
same time. But what if you 
could pinpoint who gave 
you the virus?
A research study 
called “Characterizing and 
Tracking College Health: 
The Virus Study” — 
known as C.A.T.C.H. The 
Virus — is trying to make 
that possible by tracking 
how the ?u spreads from 
student to student on 
campus at the University 
of Maryland. 
But the research-
ers aren’t tracking virus 
transmission so that stu-
dents can identify and get 
revenge on whoever got 
them sick — they’re trying 
to learn more about how 
and why viruses spread 
within a population.
The researchers, led by 
environmental and occu-
pational health researcher 
Donald Milton, are build-
ing up a pool of data from 
sick students,through col-
lecting blood, snot, and 
breath samples from sick 
students. 
The ?rst two types of 
sample are relatively easy 
to collect. To get the breath 
samples, the researchers 
have to seat the students 
in a special booth (called 
the Gesundheit-II), and 
have them put their face in 
a cone, which they breathe 
into for half an hour. 
They have also in-
stalled carbon dioxide-
sensitive instruments in 
dormitories that measure 
how much of the air has 
been exhaled by a person.
The researchers are 
interested in gathering 
data on a number of vi-
ruses, but they’re most fo-
cused on the ?u. 
“Flu is important to 
everybody,” says Milton. 
This year’s ?u season is the 
worst in the past 13 years, 
according to the Center 
for Disease Control.
Viruses mutate fairly 
quickly as they’re passed 
around campus. By track-
ing the people sick stu-
dents have interacted with 
and the genetic changes 
within the virus samples, 
the researchers will try to 
“establish who infected 
whom, and where, and 
how,” Milton says.
Flu viruses spread in a 
few different ways — by 
touch, by large droplets 
that have been coughed 
or sneezed out of some-
one’s lungs onto a surface 
like a desk, and by smaller 
droplets called aerosols, 
which hang around in the 
air after being coughed or 
sneezed out. 
But, it’s unknown how 
much each transmission 
method contributes to 
viral spread.
The aerosol particles 
are the area of most in-
terest, because they can’t 
be controlled by washing 
your hands or sterilizing 
a surface, instead remain-
ing suspended in the air. 
“This could mean that 
just having good cough 
and sneeze etiquette — 
sneezing or coughing 
into tissues — may not be 
enough to limit the spread 
of in?uenza,” says virolo-
gist Andrew Pekosz of 
Johns Hopkins University. 
“Just sitting in your of?ce 
and breathing could ?ll 
the air with infectious in-
?uenza.”
But they won’t know 
for sure how much that 
factors in until the study, 
which has been ongoing 
since November, ?nishes. 
“If we don’t understand 
how [viruses] are trans-
mitted, it’s hard to come 
up with policies that are 
really going to work,” 
Milton says.
This year’s ?u hasn’t 
hit the University of 
Maryland dormitories yet, 
but the researchers are ex-
pecting to get a lot of data 
when it does.
“Once one person gets 
sick, it goes around to ev-
eryone on the ?oor,” says 
sophomore Parker Kleb, a 
research assistant on the 
study. “I’m very interested 
to see what happens in the 
next few weeks, and how 
the study will hopefully 
bene?t.”

Penguins are bioarchives of climate change
At the American Geo-
physical Union’s 2018 
Ocean Sciences Meet-
ing on Feb. 12, scientists 
reported that penguins’ 
feathers and eggshells 
preserve chemical ?n-
gerprints of climate and 
ecological changes. 
Penguin tissues store 
the changes in the food 
that they consume, which 
can be interpreted by look-
ing at their chemical com-
position. 
For example, krill and 
?sh have different nitro-
gen isotope proportions, 
which, when consumed 
by penguins, is re?ected 
in the composition of their 
tissues.
Over?shing and climate 
change has led to some 
dramatic changes in the 
penguin lifestyle. 
Kelton McMahon, an 
oceanic ecogeochemist at 
the University of Rhode Is-
land in Kingston is a mem-
ber of this study along with 
his team developed tools 
to distinguish between 
changes in penguins’ diet 
and other climate change 
related changes. He says, 
“Penguins are excellent 
bio archives of this [envi-
ronmental] change.
“This 80-year record is 
just part of a much broader 
record of change,” McMa-
hon adds. Now, the team 
intends to study older pen-
guin artifacts. 
Paleontological exca-
vations in Wanbrow, New 
Zealand, have unearthed  
fossilized penguin egg-
shells that are between 
110,000 and 130,000 
years old.

Brains think about moving while detecting rhythms
In a study published on-
line in the Journal of Cog-
nitive Neuroscience on Jan. 
18, researchers found that 
if the region of the brain 
that planned movement 
is disabled, the brain has 
trouble detecting changes in 
rhythms.
The human brain under-
stands rhythm by making 
predictions about the spaces 
between between beats, and 
essentially guessing when 
the next beat will fall. This 
helps us interpret repeated 
sounds, like music, and this 
prediction making is a part 
of the brain system called 
relative timing.
Jessica Ross, a coauthor 
on the study and a neurosci-
ence graduate student at the 
University of California Mer-
ced, along with the team of 
researchers who worked on 
the study, rendered the ar-
eas of the brain responsible 
for movement - the poste-
rior parietal cortex and the 
supplementary motor area - 
temporarily unable to func-
tion by applying a magnetic 
pulse to that area. 
The researchers tested 
25 adults, and found that 
while the participants were 
able to identify the rhythms 
?ne without the supple-
mentary motor area, they 
couldn’t differentiate be-
tween rhythms without the 
the posterior parietal cor-
tex.
“Music is basically 
sounds that have a structure 
in time,” says Sundeep Teki, 
a neuroscientist at the Uni-
versity of Oxford. Accord-
ing to Teki, studies like this 
one help illuminate how our 
brains  understand music.

Household chemicals pollute as much as cars
A recent study shows 
that many common house-
hold chemicals contribute 
to urban air pollution at 
levels comparable to vehi-
cle exhaust. This category 
includes not just household 
cleaners, but also products 
like nail polish remover, 
printer ink, and even soap.
“The things I use in the 
morning to get ready for 
work are comparable to 
emissions that come out 
of the tailpipe of my car,” 
says lead author Brian 
McDonald, an air-pollution 
researcher at the US Na-
tional Oceanic and Atmo-
spheric Administration 
(NOAA) in Boulder, Colo-
rado. “I think that’s what 
surprises a lot of people.”
Like exhaust from cars 
and trucks, household 
chemicals contain volatile 
organic compounds. When 
they evaporate, these 
compounds contribute to 
ozone and smog.
Despite increased regu-
lation on vehicle emissions 
over the past four to ?ve 
decades, many US cities, 
like Los Angeles, struggle 
to comply with air cleanli-
ness standards. This study 
helps explain why: vehicle 
exhaust is a huge con-
tributor to urban air pol-
lution, but it isn’t the only 
contributor.
The research team used 
a variety of data, includ-
ing existing datasets and 
both indoor and outdoor 
air samples, to support 
their hypothesis. “We had 
to collect an overwhelming 
amount of evidence to say 
that these sources are im-
portant,” says McDonald.

Tree rings in New Mexico point to increased ?re risk
Scientists at the US Geo-
logical Survey (USGS) study 
tree rings to understand the 
history of a region’s climate 
so they can predict the risk of 
future wild?res. 
When a tree is cut hori-
zontally, the cross-section re-
veals layers of concentric cir-
cles. It’s common knowledge 
that one ring grows each 
year; but a ring can reveal 
more than just age: it con-
tains details about what the 
environmental conditions 
were like during that year.
According to the patterns 
in this natural historical 
data, USGS scientists claim 
that New Mexico might 
experience a devastating 
wild?re season this year. 
The area of concern is the 
Sangre de Cristo Mountains 
outside Santa Fe. Accord-
ing to the tree ring data, the 
region hasn’t experienced a 
wild?re in around a century, 
which means that the forest 
constitutes a huge amount of 
potential fuel, USGS scien-
tist Ellis Margolis explains. 
“We’re sitting on this powder 
keg,” he says.
By studying the tree ring 
histories, Margolis deter-
mined that the biggest wild-
?res occur in very dry win-
ters that occur after two or 
three years of winters with a 
lot of precipitation. After wet 
winters in 2016 and 2017, 
New Mexico is experiencing 
a very dry winter right now. 
“The lack of snow is scary,” 
says Margolis. “We’re set up 
for a big ?re year if things 
don’t change dramatically.”

This event was live-
streamed in 1080p to over 
2.3 million people, and 
hyped up with a glamor-
ous animated promotional 
video. 
The car also has three 
cameras at different angles 
that provided some glori-
ous shots of the car against 
the Earth, the Moon and in 
space. The car faded out of 
the view of telescopes on 
Feb. 14. 
The popping red of the 
car, with Starman gazing at 
the stars against the pitch 
black of space, could per-
haps be considered a part 
of the pop, postmodern art 
world.
As the CEO of Tesla 
Motors, Musk owns 27 
percent of Tesla stock. 
Though Musk is a founder 
and owner of several 
companies, Tesla is the 
original source of most of 
his signi?cant personal 
wealth (now around $21.5 
billion).
Despite its fame in the 
tech world, Tesla is still 
a relatively lesser known 
car brand, at least to the 
general public — due likely 
in part to the fact that the 
company does not use tra-
ditional paid advertising. 
With Tesla Model 
3’s production delays 
and dropping market 
credibility, this picture 
has the potential to give 
both exposure and sales 
a signi?cant boost. The 
combined image of a Tesla 
Roadster and a human-
like ?gure driving in space 
lends Musk’s brand a more 
sparkly, snazzy reputation. 
It’s easy to see how this  
striking image, essentially 
an elaborate car adver-
tisement, could be big 
enough to save sales from 
plummeting. 
Though Musk’s  per-
sonal Roadster model is 
from 2008 and no longer 
in production, and the 
next Roadsters won’t go on 
sale until 2020, the stun-
ning pictures of the Road-
ster in space are expected 
to increase the value of 
Tesla’s brand as a whole, as 
well as the original Road-
sters on their ten-year an-
niversary.
With sending Starman 
and his Roadster into 
space, there is no doubt 
that Elon Musk has 
sparked the feeling of “ad 
astra” back into space 
travel and has rightfully 
said, “Crazy things can 
come true.”

Pittsburgh Pirates third baseman David Freese had critical comments about the team’s negative culture.
BRAD PUSKAR
Staffwriter
The Pittsburgh Pirates 
are going into the start 
of Spring Training with a 
hefty controversy on their 
shoulders, and, in a recent 
interview, third baseman 
David Freese spoke about 
the attitude of the team as 
a whole last season. His 
comments were honest, and 
strongly worded, which is 
surprising, coming from a 
player who is still with the 
team.
“You have to understand 
when you walk through 
the door why we’re here,” 
Freese said. “It’s to stay out 
of the red, I guess, a little bit, 
but it is about winning...You 
don’t have to make the post-
season or this or that, but, at 
the end of the year, you have 
to say, ‘We honestly went for 
it.’”
These are harsh words 
to hear coming directly 
from a player, and they 
seem to make sense. Af-
ter two consecutive losing 
seasons, it seems that the 
problem with the Pirates 
might not boil down to the 
talent that they have, but 
an inability to break out of 
the mindset of a historically 
bad team. Regardless of 
the troubles with Starling 
Marte and Jung-Ho Kang 
last season, one could look 
at the Pirates’ lineup and see 
a lot of good players. There’s 
no explanation other than 
a negative mindset. Freese 
just might be on to some-
thing.
After the Feb. 14 pitchers 
and catchers report, it’s safe 
to say that Spring Training 
has of?cially begun. Games 
start on Feb. 23, and if what 
Freese says echoes through-
out the dugout, the Pirates 
may actually stand a chance 
to return to the caliber they 
were at three years ago.
The out?eld need a bit 
of tinkering, but there’s 
no doubt you’ll be seeing 
Gregory Polanco and 
Starling Marte out on the 
grass. Marte, without a 
doubt, will be the starting 
center ?elder after the 
Andrew McCutchen trade, 
and Polanco will likely 
reprise his role in right 
?eld, given his reported 
discomfort in left.
Polanco seems like he 
may be turning over a new 
leaf in terms of physical 
?tness. In the winter, 
he trained back in the 
Dominican Republic with 
the same ?tness instructor 
that he had worked with 
until last year. Polanco says 
that his trainer focuses 
more on agility than pure 
strength, which is where 
Polanco seemed to struggle 
last year. Hopefully he can 
break out and live up to his 
potential.
There’s a race going 
on between the Pirates’ 
relievers. 12 different 
pitchers will be vying for 
just four open seats in the 
bullpen, and there are some 
interesting competitors who 
may prove to be what the 
Bucs have been looking for 
to re-establish their mid-
2010s pitching strength.
Obviously, Felipe Rivero 
has the ninth locked down. 
There won’t be anyone 
replacing him in the closer’s 
role for quite some time, it 
seems. Setting up for the 
100-mph ?amethrower 
will more than likely fall 
on former San Francisco 
Giant George Kontos, who 
was impressive in his relief 
appearances after being 
claimed off waivers late last 
season, and Daniel Hudson, 
who might not be the best 
choice, after what was a 
lackluster 2017.
The other four spots, 
however, are open to 
whoever can prove 
themselves. Michael 
Feliz, Kyle Crick, Dovydas 
Neverauskas, Edgar 
Santana, A.J. Schugel, Josh 
Smoker, Jack Leathersich, 
and Jordan Milbrath will 
all get the opportunity to 
?t into the relief rotation. I 
like the look of Santana and 
Smoker, especially. Santana 
was a great strikeout guy 
after being called up in 
September of last year, and 
for Smoker, it seems like 
a change of scenery from 
the New York Mets could 
do him good. All of the 
relievers have the stuff that 
the Bucs will need from their 
bullpen, so whoever ends 
up grabbing the seats will 
hopefully make us proud.
Spring Training games 
start on Feb. 23, and the ?rst 
few are only being broadcast 
on radio, so make sure to 
tune in and get an early taste 
of that baseball fever!

 There are a couple things 
we associate with the spring: 
light rain, pollen allergies, 
and fresh-cut grass. As 
the weather gets warmer, 
something else on Carnegie 
Mellon University’s campus 
also begins: club baseball.
Baseball has been a 
part of Carnegie Mellon 
for decades, and today it 
is present as a club sport, 
competing in Division II of 
the National Club Baseball 
Association. Claudio 
Reilsono has been the coach 
since 2005.
The club baseball season 
starts in the beginning of 
March, and runs through to 
the beginning of May. The 
biggest difference between 
club baseball and NCAA 
Division III baseball is the 
time commitment. In the 
winter, the team practices 
twice a week in Skibo 
Gymnasium, and when the 
weather gets warmer, they 
practice at a local ?eld 
outside Pittsburgh. While all 
members 
of the team 
are committed to 
baseball and are passionate 
about playing, school comes 
?rst.
For John Schuman, a 
sophomore Statistics and 
Machine Learning major 
with an additional major 
in Logic and Computation, 
club baseball has given him 
the opportunity to both 
continue playing the sport 
he has been a part of since 
childhood while still focus-
ing on his academics at 
Carnegie Mellon.
“I knew I 
wanted 
to 
play baseball in college,” 
Schuman said in an inter-
view with The Tartan. “I 
came the summer before 
college to check [the team] 
out and meet the team, and 
watched a game of theirs. 
They just showed a lot of 
?ght, and showed they real-
ly cared.”
The 
?rst games of the 2018 
season occur over the ?rst 
weekend spring break, when 
the team makes the 20-hour 
drive to Florida to play the 
?rst four games of the sea-
son. The trip gives the team 
a chance to have fun playing 
baseball in Florida’s great 
weather, and to bond 
as 
a team.
“Last year, it 
was the best experience 
and made all of it worth it,” 
Schuman said. “It’s a 20-
hour drive, like team bond-
ing, but de?nitely a grind. 
Hanging out in the dugout 
with the guys, getting your 
mind off of school – the fun 
of it [is] the most important 
thing. It’s very rewarding.”
Many students who are 
currently members of the 
team didn’t know what 
club sports are, or that 
Carnegie Mellon 
has a club 
baseball team until 
they got to campus. 
The team hopes to 
be more accessible to 
pstudents who would 
otherwise be interested in 
joining the team but do not 
know about it. Schuman 
says they are in the process 
of building a new website.
In addition to having 
fun playing baseball, 
Schuman says that the team 
has allowed him to meet 
different people brought 
together by a shared love for 
the sport.
“I think I’ve learned 
something from each and 
every one of [my team-
mates],” he said. “Every-
body is from all different 
backgrounds and had all 
different reasons for joining. 
We just have some really 
great guys on the team, they 
make it all worth it.”
The team can be reached 
through their website on 
Carnegie Mellon’s Bridge 
network for those who 
have questions or are 
interest in joining.

The 2018 Winter Olympics in 
PyeongChang has entered the second 
week of competition, and, at the 
moment, the United States sits ?fth 
on the medal leaderboard, with ten 
total medals, ?ve of them gold. Stellar 
performances in snowboarding pro-
pelled America to the front, but with 
plenty of events left to go, there is 
more than enough time to collect 
even more medals. With medals 
awarded for events in thirteen sports, 
and plenty more to come in the next 
week, let’s look back at the standout 
moments for America, before looking 
forward into the best events to watch 
coming up.
Snowboarding
The United States is known for 
dominating snowboarding in the 
Winter Olympics, and 2018 was no 
exception. With six events in the 
sport, the United States secured gold 
medals in the four individual events. 
17-year-old phenom Chloe Kim won 
her ?rst gold medal in the women’s 
halfpipe, with American Arielle Gold 
taking the bronze. Shaun White won 
his third halfpipe gold — a medal 
which also counted as the 100th 
gold ever won by America at the 
Winter Olympics. Red Gerard and 
Jamie Anderson won gold in men’s 
and women’s slopestyle respectively. 
Lindsey Jacobellis ?nished fourth 
in women’s snowcross. All in all, 
American snowboarders currently 
hold half of the United States’ medals 
as they continue to dominate the 
sport on the international level.
Alpine Skiing
While most of the American 
skiing world was focused on Lindsey 
Vonn’s return to competing after 
multiple injuries, she fell to sixth in 
the women’s Super-G competition. 
Earlier in the week, two-time 
Olympian Mikaela Shiffrin secured 
the gold medal in giant slalom, 
although she would later fall short 
of the podium by 0.08 seconds in 
women’s slalom, ?nishing in fourth. 
On the men’s side, two-time Olympic 
gold medalist Ted Ligety failed to 
complete the men’s slalom course.
Figure Skating
Despite a disappointing ?rst 
short program from 18-year-old 
Nathan Chen, the United States 
secured bronze in the team ?gure 
skating competition due to amazing 
performances by skater Adam Rippon 
and ice dancing team Alex and 
Maia Shibutani. Unfortunately, no 
individual medals have been won by 
the United States yet, although Chen 
staged a miraculous comeback from 
17th place after the short program to 
?nish ?fth in men’s singles. 17-year-
old Vincent Zhou placed sixth, while 
Rippon rounded out the top ten. Pair 
skaters Alexa Scimeca Knierim and 
Chris Knierim ?nished 15th overall.
Luge
A normally uncommon sport for 
the United States, America’s ?rst 
ever singles luge medal was brought 
home by Chris Mazdzer, with a silver 
in the men’s event. He is also the only 
non-European athlete to ever medal 
in the event.
Short Track Speed Skating
Olympic rookie John-Henry 
Krueger secured the silver medal 
in the men’s 1000m event, the ?rst 
American medal in speed skating 
since 2010. After narrowly avoiding a 
three-skater collision near the end of 
the race, Krueger ?nished fractions 
of a second behind the Canadian 
skater.
The ?gure skating competition 
continues through Wednesday, with 
ice dancing on the weekend and 
ladies’ singles up next. Ice hockey 
enters the quarter?nals stage this 
week for both the men and women’s 
teams — the men are entering 
following a 0-4 shutout loss against 
the Olympic Athletes from Russia 
(OAR), while the women remain 
favorites for the gold medal even 
after losing a close game to Canada, 
1-2. Curling is continuing to pick 
up, with the women’s team beating 
the OAR team before falling behind 
to Canada. They will continue 
to compete in the round robin 
competition.
With plenty of other events still 
lined up before closing ceremonies, 
the Olympics are far from over. 
There are countless story lines and 
narratives to follow, and history is 
being made nearly every second. If 
you haven’t already, take some time 
out of your busy day to watch the 
best athletes in the world do what 
they do best.

On midterms and procrastination
Dear Izzy,
Do you ever have that existential feeling of dread 
and expectation of failure even before giving 
yourself a little bit of faith? Well that’s how I feel 
about my midterm. I just did so poorly on all my 
tests last semester (thankfully everything else 
just pulled up my grade) that I’m just worried I’m 
gonna fall into the same cycle. I’m worried that I 
won’t have enough time in the week to actually 
study effectively because of all my other classes, 
and that if I do have free time, procrastination 
will get the better of me and I will end up 
shamefully (or shamelessly, depending on my 
mood) watching Keeping Up With The Kardashians 
instead. I would ask for help or study with 
groups, but I feel like I’d just end up flopping 
like a fish in terms of my grasp on the material, 
because I’m so behind. Is there anything that you 
recommend I should do?
Desperate On Options Making Exam prep Decent
Dear DOOMED,
As much as people hate to admit it, 
procrastination is something that everyone will 
struggle with so don’t be ashamed of that. The TV 
show choice though is a tough call, but this is also 
coming from someone who worships Riverdale 
and its aesthetic in secrecy. But that’s beside the 
point.
One of the best ways to combat wasting your free 
time can be, ironically, planning it out. Identify 
when you’re free during the day: do you have 
a substantial amount of time in between two 
classes? Is there an adequate amount of time you 
have between two meetings? What time do you 
get home every night? Once you’ve gathered all 
those hours together, schedule out when you’ll do 
certain assignments. Be a fair judge on how much 
time you think you’ll take, and keep the schedule 
next to you while you’re doing work. And then 
— this is the most important — follow it. There will 
be distractions, but for the most part stay focused 
and on track. If you don’t finish something in 
the time frame you set for yourself, just stop and 
move on.
Secondly, office hours are there for the people 
in that floppy fish mood. At some point, maybe 
even the teaching assistants (TAs) of your class 
felt that way too. They will totally be open to 
you and your problems; that’s what TAs are 
there for, and the last thing they would want 
is having your insecurities and fears overtake 
your desire to understand and learn more. Your 
study group members will be like that too; heck, 
they might even learn a bit from you after your 
understanding of the concept clicks around them.
Finally, don’t forget to take a mental break 
once in a while and put it in your schedule. Get 
a healthy amount of sleep — it will do more for 
your concentration, mood, and brain than you 
think it will. It will give you time to process the 
material, focus on something else, and come 
back with a fresh perspective and energy to take 
on a challenge. Take care of yourself, eat some 
comfort food, or do something that you love. Or 
at the very least, watch something a little better 
on Netflix. You can study, attend office hours, 
and schedule all you want, but you’ll do a lot 
better if you let your brain relax a little bit and 
maintain a healthy balance of work and leisure.
Best,
Izzy
Jade Crockem | Contributing EditorBar Buddies: Sienna Mercato
This weekend, Aisha and I really went outside of 
our comfort zone. It was the one night that we 
were able to get a big group of friends together, 
and we went all out. Venturing far outside of our 
usual domains, we found ourselves downtown at 
Sienna Mercato. This place has three different 
places rolled into one. The first floor is a meatball 
restaurant, Emporio, and much more casual, the 
next floor, Mezzo, is a pizza place that is a bit 
more upscale, and the final top floor, Il Tetto, is 
a rooftop beer garden. This was where we found 
ourselves spending most of our night.
The location: Located on Penn Ave., Sienna 
Mercato is in the middle of all the action 
downtown. This makes it a considerable ride away 
from campus, so it’s not the place to just stop by on 
a night out, it’s your destination for the night.
Going downtown however, you’re far less likely to 
see Carnegie Mellon students so if you’re looking 
for a break from the campus scene you’ll definitely 
find it here. I won’t say that the people you’ll find 
will be better, but they’ll certainly be different.
The drinks: The drinks here were very strong 
because this is a bar where actual adults go and 
you’ll think you’re having a great time until you get 
the bill. Make no mistake, this is a rooftop bar in 
downtown with an amazing view when the rooftop 
is open in the summer. You are not going to get 
away with having a good time with just 20 bucks. 
But, if you’re prepared to splurge, you’ll get some 
nice drinks. Also, if you’re an avid beer drinker, 
this is a beer garden, so you’ll find a nice range of 
drafts. I didn’t have any beer, but it certainly was 
tempting. Perhaps when I go back for a more calm 
night I’ll just relax and have a beer on the roof 
instead of taking tequila shots.
The vibe: The vibe here is a bit more adult. 
There’s a good mix of people wearing jeans 
but also suits here. It was a bit strange because 
the music was very hype and they played a lot 
of popular music. However, this wasn’t really 
the place to dance. No one was really dancing 
and the people I was with seemed to be the 
only people that even recognized the music. The 
playlist made me feel like I was back in Shadyside 
buying songs on TouchTunes, but the environment 
was not like that at all. There could have been a 
better vibe if more people wanted to dance, but it 
was still nice.
Lit or nah: This is tricky. I really like the space and 
the drinks were good and the music was nice, but 
I don’t know if the vibe here can be described as 
lit. I felt like my group was having a lit time, but 
everyone else kind of seemed to just be having a 
casual night out. So this place is kind of what you 
make it. With the rooftop part actually open, it’s 
hard to not have a good time with the incredible

Could Yung Lean fill up a huge venue the way he might have been able to a couple of years ago? Probably not. But there is 
something about the nature of a small venue, packed to the brim that seemed to suit his concert last Saturday perfectly, lending it 
the energy of people bouncing off each other in a small space but also the intimacy brought by close proximity.
Many are surprised to learn that rapper Yung Lean’s actual legal middle name is Leandoer, as in one who does lean. While this might 
make his career choice seem inevitable, apparently Leandoer is a pretty common name in Sweden. Jonatan Leandoer Håstad had been 
uploading tracks to Soundcloud produced by fellow “sad boys” Yung Gud and Yung Sherman when he released his first mixtape, Unknown 
Death 2002, in 2013, and quickly gained acclaim, which he has recognized is due in a large part to the shock factor of a Swedish person rap-
ping in mediocre English about Mario Kart and being sad. Since then, he has released three full length studio albums.
His concert in Spirit Hall on Feb. 10 marked the last show on his tour promoting his latest album, Stranger. His openers were Thaiboy Digital and 
Bladee, both members of “Drain Gang” alongside Yung Lean. Contrary to the moniker, Thaiboy Digital and Bladee were an uplifting part of the evening, 
playing banger after banger, before being brought back during the encore for an energetic end to the Stranger tour.
In an interview with Complex, Yung Lean called his past album, Stranger, “his Pet Sounds.” Though I do not count myself as a devoted fan who can chronicle 
his growth from a young (yung?) teenager dropping tracks from his parents’ house, it is pretty easy to see how he has developed lyrically, rhythmically, and 
emotionally from his earlier days. Despite his belief that he has peaked in this era, his set included a lot of his classics, if songs from the early 2010s can be 
called classics. Perhaps this was a choice to pacify his fans, who have stuck with him through many artistic phases and life crises, but it sent the message that 
Yung Lean was not, by any means, attempting to bury his meme-y roots.
Where Thaiboy Digital and Bladee seemed to know that their job was to keep the crowd excited, Yung Lean was not afraid to shift the mood many times. 
Sometimes this meant a lull in the concert, but this was a lull I was occasionally grateful for because my face is the perfect height for being shoved into sweaty 
hoods of various sweatshirts. Accompanied by large inflatable sad boys on either side of the stage, as well as an audience member that clambered up to join 
him, Yung Lean sang favorites like “Afghanistan,” “Kyoto,” and “Oreomilkshake” as well as the most successful song from his new album, “Red Bottom Sky” 
and a personal favorite from Stranger, “Metallic Intuition.”
Stranger is worth a listen, though I’m sure that some of the weaker moments translated better to a hazy, crowded, venue and the excitement of live music 
than, say, listening on a bus or a morning run. Maybe Yung Lean’s insistence that he is producing his best work now is not surprising, given that someone who 
markets themselves as a sad boy while relying on cliche to the point of absurdism will eventually have to have a reckoning where he decides if he wants to 
be viewed as a serious artist or a novelty. Or maybe he is just not a teenager anymore and his music reflects the growth and trauma of maturing in the public 
eye.
Either way, this concert showcased both tortured artist Yung Lean and quirky weird Yung Lean from the internet, and proved that, though neither of those fac-
ets were life-changing for me, both were pretty solid. Bra jobb, Yung Lean!

On Black Panther: The Album, Kendrick Lamar 
crafts a bold, uncompromising cinematic 
soundtrack while ceding the spotlight to its array 
of wonderful guests. Lamar’s presence is felt all 
over the album, and yet he rarely dominates 
a single track. The only track where he is the 
sole listed artist is the opener, aptly titled “Black 
Panther.” On it, Lamar opens the album with 
an experimental thematic unifier that carries 
through the rest of the project. That unification is 
the sound, which Lamar has crafted specifically 
for this project. His curative touch is felt on every 
track, even when he is completely absent. For 
an album that has such a substantial number of 
established artists, each with their own following 
and unique sound, Lamar and his producers 
manage to bring together a project far more 
cohesive than most modern records.
As he often speaks for numerous people in his 
life on his solo records, Lamar instead opts to 
adopt the personas of characters from the film, 
reserving his voice for introductions and transi-
tions for several tracks. From King T’Challa to 
villain Erik Killmonger, all of Lamar’s personas 
feel calculated, but they don’t overstay their wel-
come. When Lamar delivers a proper verse, it is 
show-stopping. On “King’s Dead,” Lamar recap-
tures the lightning-in-a-bottle energy of last year’s 
“DNA.” Make no mistake, these tracks could 
easily find themselves on one of Lamar’s seminal 
albums. They’re developed well, produced well, 
provocative, intentionally crafted, and catchy as 
hell.
Perhaps most impressive is Lamar’s predilection 
for taking the least famous artists on the bill and 
bringing them to the forefront. As “Rapsody” 
received the most prominent feature on To Pimp 
a Butterfly with “Complexion (A Zulu Love),” 
South African female rapper Yugen Blakrok 
steals the show on “Opps.” Numerous South 
African artists appear on the project, from Saudi 
to Sjava to Babes Wodumo. It is amazing to 
see African artists appear alongside prominent 
African-American artists. The album stands as a 
unapologetic celebration of black culture across 
the globe.
The album seems like a sum of all the best parts 
of modern hip hop. From the trap-infused flute 
sample on banger “Big Shot” to the bouncy 
SoCal anthem “Paramedic!,” the project brings 
an impressive array of sounds to the table while 
seeming consistent. Even “Redemption” -- in 
which DAMN. collaborator Zacari 
returns -- incorporates a native African 
sound courtesy of Wodumo. 
Perhaps boldest is “Seasons,” a 
devastating song covering three 
artists’ comeups. Most impressive, 
however, is that the song is bilin-
gual. Sjava’s opening verse is writ-
ten and performed in Zulu. That one 
fact elevates the track to importance 
on the album, as it connects the 
struggles of black people all across 
the globe while calling for strength, 
resilience and perseverance. Thanks 
to the aforementioned Sjava verse 
and excellent verses from Mozzy 
and Reason, this track stands out, 
even with Lamar only appearing in 
the outro in spoken word form.
Vince Staples delivers an excel-
lent performance in “Opps,” and 
The Weeknd brings his usual dark 
angelic energy to closer “Pray For 
Me.” Jorja Smith steals the album 
with the darkly smooth “I Am,” and Ab 
Soul, Anderson Paak, and James Blake 
team up on the wonderfully dreary 
“Bloody Waters.” Everyone who 
appears on the project -- aside from 
maybe Zacari, who is outshone by 
Wodumo during his appearance -- 
justifies their place in the tracklist, and 
all feel committed to producing a quality, cohe-
sive, unique album.
Black Panther: The Album stands as one the best 
albums of the year already, and it is a movie 
soundtrack. That is extraordinary, and it speaks 
to the vision and talent of Kendrick Lamar, who 
once again brings out the best in a long list of 
collaborators and delivers another fantastic 
project.

“Ferox is primal. Ferox is chaotic. Ferox is 
a return to instinct. Embodied by the human 
species, Ferox represents a blind and reckless 
freedom that must be contained for the sake of 
maintaining the civility we all value and from 
which we all benefit. Ultimately…Ferox must be 
quelled.”
The theme description for this year’s Lunar 
Gala, Pittsburgh’s largest fashion event, held 
last Saturday at the Wiegand Gym in the 
Cohon Center, accurately described not only 
the event itself, but also its atmosphere and 
environment. Coming from someone who can’t 
go a single day without incorporating black in 
her outfit, has a lipstick collection that contains 
predominantly darker shades, and who experi-
ments with bra harnesses, leather, ear cuffs, 
and heels when going to class, I walked into 
Wiegand Gym “dressed down” in my worn-
down H&M jeans, beaten Steve Maddens, and 
dark plaid shirt feeling severely underdressed 
among the amount of suits, fur coats, fringe, 
and velvet that I saw among the audience 
members.
Everything about last 
year’s Lunar Gala 
felt primitive compared to 
the higher level of complexity, 
fashion, and innovation among the 
dancers, attendees, and the 19 collections 
featured on the runway in FEROX. The show 
maintained a perfect balance of raw, visceral 
passion with modern, sleek talent among all 
the collections, and each one offered a dif-
ferent dimension, angle, and interpretation of 
combining those two very different worlds and 
concepts. Every component of the show worked 
harmoniously with each other, from the music 
choices of each collection to the overall pro-
gram and order of each fashion collection to 
the choreography of each dance routine.
The first three lines of Lunar Gala, Maille, 
Chinoiseries, and Travaille, perhaps best 
describe FEROX’s pristine harmony under 
its chaotic aesthetic. The medieval-inspired 
line Maille, created by fifth-year senior and 
Psychology major Noa Wolff-Fineout, estab-
lishes a great contrast of elegance and history 
in 
prep-
aration 
for the more 
futuristic looks from 
the later collections, while 
still feeling modern for the 
present day. Elaborating more on 
the historical foundations that Maille had 
established, Chinoiseries, designed by junior 
Architecture students Kornrat Euchukanonchai 
and Shariwa Sharada alongside senior 
Architecture student Gunn Chaiyapatranun, has 
a universal, timeless beauty to it that thorough-
ly explores both Asian and Western cultures. 
Sophomore art student Ava Kling’s Travaille 
follows, jarringly and masterfully subverting 
gender norms exemplified through traditional 
men’s workwear in a powerful artistic statement

that 
received a 
ton of praise from 
the audience after it was 
showcased.
However, these three collections weren’t 
the only highlights of the show. Junior 
Art student Tatyana Mustakos and senior 
humanities and arts student Soojin Sohn’s 
Morfologia were inspired by elements 
of the human body to create a line that 
was ethereal, flowy, and dynamic. Stack, 
designed by freshman Computer Science 
and Arts student Sebastian Carpenter, per-
haps was the closest collection that resem-
bled art through its use of inorganic mate-
rials to create organic structures on the 
models. My 
personal favor-
ite (mostly due to 
the collection’s love affair 
with black), local designer 
Krista Wilhelm’s Nightmare, felt cur-
rent, elegant, and breathtaking. Wilhelm’s 
collection uses the color black as a tool to 
create an alluring collection pulled straight 
from my dreams.
2268, designed by junior Architecture 
student Hamza Qureshi and Decision 
Sciences senior Anny Fan, is incredibly 
innovative in its use of plants and its state-
ment on climate change. In addition, the 
collection feels very central to FEROX’s 
overall theme, a world where Lunar Gala 
is run by the fictional Interplanetary 
Federation and the event puts human cul-
ture, or “the savagery we have successful-
ly contained,” on display. 2268’s agenda 
that it seeks to promote mirrors the pas-
sion and overall storyline of Lunar Gala’s 
theme. The story of FEROX, as a theme 
and as a show, feels like a sci-fi novel 
masterfully interpreted not 
as a movie but rather as an art 
piece, with each act telling a larger 
story on the rebellious and primal nature 
of humanity, and how while the Federation 
aims to contain it, attempts are futile and 
how FEROX can’t be quelled, but rather 
stoked.
However, at its core, FEROX celebrates 
humanity – its history, its body, and its spir-
it. Latin for “fierce,” FEROX celebrates our 
existence through its appreciation of our 
global and cultural history and its thoughts 
and dreams on humanity’s future with a 
fierce passion felt throughout the entire 
room. Lines seek to challenge social views 
and put forward a message with a fierce 
energy that refuses to be contained. It nur-
tures the spirit, and FEROX uses the restric-
tive Interplanetary Federation as a call for 
freedom and revolution in all senses.
Lunar Gala’s FEROX is a celebration of 
Carnegie Mellon’s innovation, culture, and 
talent among its student body. FEROX is a 
movement to promote greater action and 
creativity. And ultimately, FEROX cannot 
be quelled.

“Three blind mice. Three blind mice. 
See how they run. See how they run…” 
And so the play begins in darkness, 
with a nursery rhyme and a scream.
Agatha Christie’s murder mystery 
The Mousetrap twists the already 
gruesome and disturbing nursery rhyme 
and takes it to a whole new level. 
Carnegie Mellon students swarmed 
the Cohon Center Studio Theater this 
past weekend to see Scotch’n’Soda’s 
production of Christie’s play, directed 
by junior Computer Science student 
Will Walters and first-year Electrical 
and Computer Engineering student Kai 
Huizenga.
The stage is set on a frigid day in 
England at Monkswell Manor, where 
Mollie Ralston and her husband Giles 
are setting up their newly converted 
guesthouse for their first slew of 
patrons. With their guests arriving any 
minute, Mollie and Giles — played 
by first-year Dietrich student Hannah 
Cornish and junior Information Systems 
major Walter Donnellan, respectively — 
are eager to have everything in order. 
Yet, a message on the radio warns of 
the trouble soon to come. If the Ralstons 
weren’t already anxious enough about 
their new business venture, the news 
of a murderer on the loose in the area 
certainly does the trick in worrying the 
couple. Quickly, however, they must 
compose themselves as their first guests 
begin to appear at the door.
In comes the strange and 
misunderstood Christopher Wren, 
played by senior and Bachelor of 
Computer Science and Arts student 
Alyss Weissglass. Later follows haughty 
old Mrs. Boyle, played by junior 
Decision Science and Psychology 
student Heather Graci, with friendly 
Major Metcalf, portrayed by first-year 
engineering student Julien Buron. With 
Mrs. Boyle horrified by the Ralstons’ 
lack of experience and staff, a lot 
of pressure is building amongst the 
residents and their hosts. Just as they 
begin to settle in and Miss Casewell 
— their final expected guest, played 
by first-year Biochemistry major 
Emily Schneider and understudy Zoe 
Marshall, a first year-student in Dietrich 
— arrives, another knock at the door 
reveals a mysterious guest. Confused 
and a bit overwhelmed by the 
boisterous foreigner, Mollie Ralston still 
accepts Mr. Paravicini, played by first-
year Chemical Engineering, Biomedical 
Engineering, and English student Olivia 
Olshevski, under her roof despite not 
knowing anything about him. She then 
realizes that she knows next to nothing 
about the guests that now occupy her 
house. And so the day ends, the guests 
are snowed in, and the police show up. 
Detective Sergeant Trotter, played by 
junior Music student Jordan Speranzo, 
announces that the murderer is among 
them, and chaos ensues. The killer is 
still waiting to kill the last two mice, 
and anyone could be the murderer 
or the one in danger. Nobody is safe 
from harm, and nobody is safe from 
the scrutiny of the rest of the Monkswell 
occupants, particularly when all are 
harboring secrets. So who could the 
killer be?
To be honest, I’m not usually a fan of 
mysteries, but this one definitely kept 
me on my toes and surprised me. In the 
past, I’ve been pretty good at figuring 
mysteries out, but this show was 
different. You quickly learn to trust no 
one. As a good mystery should, there 
are so many twists and turns that force 
you to question everyone’s intentions. 
By the end, I had no idea who was in 
danger or who the killer was.
Each character was fascinating and 
many were delightfully quirky, bringing 
laughter to the audience amidst the 
dark themes and tragic backstories 
revealed throughout the show. I 
equally enjoyed and was annoyed 
by Mrs. Boyle’s continuously scathing 
and cynical commentary and Mr. 
Paravacini’s ridiculous antics.

Each actor seemed to be the perfect 
fit for their respective roles, with no 
character or actor seeming to outshine 
the rest. All commanded the stage in 
their own way and complemented each 
other superbly.
While the acting was absolutely 
fantastic, one of the most notable 
things about the show was the layout 
of the set. Typically, audiences are 
separated from the performance due to 
distance, elevation, and other factors, 
but here everyone was so close to the 
stage that it felt like we were almost 
part of the show. The audience was on 
the same level as the stage, and while 
difficult to see from the back at times, 
the effect overall was a positive one. 
Not only was the audience on the same 
ground as the performance, but the 
walls of the manor also extended into 
the audience, making the setting more 
intimate and drawing viewers into the 
scene even more.
The overall talent of the Scotch’n’Soda 
cast and crew always blows me 
away. From the incredible set design 
that brought the scenes to life to the 
brilliant cast that truly embraced their 
characters, Scotch’n’Soda’s production 
of The Mousetrap was a successfully 
chilling and humorous murder mystery.

Last year, the Spark the Movement showcase served as a creative way for students on campus to express their thoughts and feelings 
on a variety social issues. Students used various forms of art, from dance to poetry, to bring light to relevant topics such as race, 
gender equality, and mental health. First introduced to the campus community as a project by former fifth-year scholar Rachel Freer, 
Spark the Movement has now become its own student organization, which intends to host the showcase each year. The event is 
meant to inspire others to speak their minds on the current issues we face in society and to create a safe space where all voices and 
perspectives are welcomed.
This year’s showcase will be presented in two parts: the first will take place in Rangos Ballroom at 7:30 p.m. and will feature 12 
live performances by various student dancers, singers, and poets. Viewers should expect the live performance part to tell stories of 
personal and social struggle, as well as hope and empowerment. The second part of the showcase will take place immediately after 
the first, during a reception at the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion. There, attendees can enjoy refreshments while viewing 
visual art pieces created by students; the visual art exhibition will continue to be displayed a week after the showcase. Events like 
this one are important for our campus, as they can help remind members of our community to be kind and take care of one another.
The Spark the Movement showcase is funded by your student activities fees and the Division of Student Affairs, and the reception is 
being sponsored by the Center for Student Diversity and Inclusion.

Pittsburgh Opera’s Ashes & Snow
written by Michelle Madlansacay | Pillbox Editor

Pittsburgh Opera debuted its show, Ashes & Snow on Saturday at the Pittsburgh Opera Headquarters in the Strip District. The opera was com-
posed by Douglas J. Cuomo and directed by Jonathan Moore. It also features set design work by Carnegie Mellon alum, Brandon McNeel. Ashes 
& Snow follows a man who struggles to confront his dark past and must seek out forgiveness and learn to move on. The opera features a “21st- 
Century art song” style of music, with a good mix of jazz and punk. Ashes and Snow is based on Wilhelm Mueller and Franz Schubert’s song 
cycle, Winterreise. It will be running until next Sunday, Feb. 25. 
Pittsburgh Opera Resident Artist, Eric Ferring portrays the main protagonist in Ashes & Snow
