Perspectives on the Asian experience at Carnegie Mellon
by David E. Chen 
Staffwriter
Approximately 24 percent of 
Carnegie Mellon’s undergraduate 
student population identifies itself as 
Asian-American or Pacific Islander, 
according to recent statistics from 
Carnegie Mellon’s department of In­
stitutional Research & Analysis. The 
new data marks a 0.7 percent increase 
in this figure since fall 2003. In com­
parison, all other minorities combined 
make up less than 11 percent.
Carnegie Mellon is not the only 
school with a high Asian student pop­
ulation. Other top universities across 
the U.S. share a similar number of 
Asian students. At the University of 
California, Berkeley, 46 percent of 
first-year students are Asian, accord­
ing to a January 7 article in The New 
York Times. MIT is at 27 percent, and 
Stanford is at 24 percent.
The fact that Carnegie Mellon is a sci­
ence and engineering-oriented school 
may account for the reason why so 
many Asian and Asian-American stu­
dents choose to enroll. Statistics show 
that Asian-American students tend 
to be more proficient in mathemat­
ics than peers of other ethnic groups. 
For example, 43 percent of Asian- 
American students took calculus in 
high school compared to 27 percent 
of white students, according to a 2004 
College Board press release.
Also, the reason that many Asian 
students are qualified to attend 
Carnegie Mellon may have to do with 
the importance that the Asian culture 
places on education.
“If you did grow up in an Asian 
family, the Asian culture cultivates an 
environment of competition and con­
stant improvement of yourself,” said 
Maryanne Tomazic, a first-year student 
studying Chinese at Swarthmore Col­
lege in Swarthmore, Pa. “Often, Asian 
students have really high standards, 
and stereotypes develop because of
that.”
The presence of Asian and 
Asian-American students 
on campus is hard to ignore. 
Numerous Asian- 
interest student 
organizations are 
active on cam­
pus, including the 
Asian Student As­
sociation (ASA) 
and Big Straw,
Carnegie Mellon’s 
Asian-Ameri- 
can interests 
magazine that is 
published annu­
ally. In addition, 
there are many 
ethnicity-specific 
student organi­
zations, ranging 
from Awareness of 
Roots in Chinese Cul­
ture. (ARCC) to the 
Vietnamese Student 
Association (VSA), as 
well as Asian-specific 
Greek organizations 
on campus. The first, 
the fraternity Pi Delta 
Psi, was founded in 
December 2001.
Asian-interest student 
organization leaders 
feel that it is important 
to cater to the Asian- 
American population 
and bridge the gap 
between Asians and 
Asian-Americans, partic­
ularly Asian-Americans 
who have adapted to 
American culture but 
are the product of more 
traditional Asian par­
ents.

need, because most of us belong to the 
generation that’s standing between

First Triple Helix in print
by Claire Morgenstern
News Editor
Carnegie Mellon students can 
study pretty much whatever they 
want, cutting across disciplinary 
lines to create the perfect course 
of study. So it seems only natural 
that the university would join 
the ranks of other prestigious 
research institutions by creating 
a chapter of The Triple Helix, an 
interdisciplinary college research 
journal published each semester 
that focuses on issues surround­
ing science, society, law, and all 
related fields in between.
The Triple Helix was founded 
two years ago by Kevin Hwang 
of Cornell University. It was 
brought to Carnegie Mellon by 
junior business major Mizel Dju- 
kic, now the organization’s CEO. 
In fall 2005, The Triple Helix of­
ficially recognized Carnegie 
Mellon as a chapter. Erin Gold- 
berger, a junior in professional 
writing, became Carnegie Mel­
lon’s editor-in-chief, and she and 
Djukic started accepting submis­
sions from writers for their first 
issue.
“I felt that CMU was missing 
out on an opportunity to join 
in on a discussion of interdisci­
plinary education,” Djukic said. 
“CMU is such a great school, es­
pecially for research, and I was 
surprised that we didn’t have an 
organization like it, while other 
schools we’re competing with 
did.”
Currently, the organization 
boasts 28 chapters at universities 
across four continents, including 
Oxford University, Melbourne 
University, the London School 
of Economics, and the National 
University of Singapore, as well 
as Harvard, Princeton, Yale, 
Penn, and MIT.
The publication process is 
complex. Students must apply for 
contributing writer status before 
they even begin choosing topics
for their articles. Once the arti­
cles are written, they are sent to 
Cornell, the magazine’s epicen­
ter, and returned to the writers 
for editing. Writers typically go 
through three drafts this way be­
fore the article is finalized.
The magazine is a combination 
of international articles, written 
by students from different chap­
ters within the organization and 
chosen by Cornell to be printed in 
all chapter universities’ editions, 
and Carnegie Mellon articles, 
which are written exclusively by 
CMU students and appear only 
in Carnegie Mellon’s edition.
The Triple Helix is unique in 
both composition and content. 
Writers for the journal take is­
sues of science, ethics, law, and 
a variety of other disciplines, 
dissect them, and present them 
in an understandable way to the 
public, Goldberger said.
Unlike Thought, Carnegie Mel­
lon’s research journal, The Triple 
Helix doesn’t publish research 
or technical papers, Gold­
berger said. In addition, since 
the editorial process is so time- 
consuming, the articles are not 
about timely matters, but delve 
into more long-term issues that 
the journal’s audience wouldn’t 
be able to read about anywhere 
else.
The first issue of The Triple He­
lix at Carnegie Mellon featured 
articles by 10 CMU students, one 
of which was chosen for the jour­
nal’s international section.
The article, written by junior 
biology major Samantha Con­
roy, was titled “Edible Vaccines: 
Transgenic Plant Research Intro­
duces New Vaccine Technology.” 
The article discusses how vac­
cines in pill form would increase 
the availability of vaccines and 
the ease with which they are 
taken, hopefully leading to more 
people choosing to receive vac­
cinations.

Graduate students green-up vacant lots
by Sabrina Porter
Junior Staffwriter
According to the results of a 
Heinz School study, a rebirth 
could be in store for Pittsburgh’s 
14,000 vacant lots. The study, re­
leased on December 11, examines 
the many negative consequences 
of vacant land and suggests pol­
icy changes to improve current 
conditions.
The project began under the 
Vacant Property Working Group 
formed by the late Mayor Bob 
O’Connor’s “Redd Up” initiative 
and has continued under Mayor 
Luke Ravenstahl. The intitiative 
aims to make Pittsburgh one of 
the cleanest and safest cities in 
the world through public works 
projects throughout the commu­
nity, including developing and 
utilizing empty plots of land.
“Vacant lots in Pittsburgh 
represent an opportunity to 
do something groundbreak­
ing,” said public policy student 
Nathan Wildfire, head of the
project. “Traditionally, they have 
had severe blighting influences 
on their communities, but re­
cent momentum suggests a real 
desire to transform these spaces 
into green, both environmen­
tally and economically.”
Since August 2006, the 11 
graduate students of the Green­
ing Vacant Land Team have 
logged nearly 4000 hours con­
ducting’ research, interview­
ing the community, speaking 
with experts, and discussing 
policy recommendations. Their 
report, “Greening Vacant Lots 
for Pittsburgh’s Sustainable 
Neighborhood Revitalization,” 
examines the economic, social, 
and environmental effects of 
the problem, from neighbor­
hood degradation and financial 
burden to the inhibition of rede­
velopment efforts.
“I have never seen a city quite 
like Pittsburgh,” said first-year 
computer sfcience major Gabby 
Moskowitz. “You walk in one 
part and it is beautiful, but in the 
next part it looks like people have
stopped paying attention to it.” 
The advantages of lot restora­
tion are not only aesthetic. From 
an economic standpoint, the 
city can only benefit from the re­
vitalization of the vacant land. 
The team’s report claims that 
for every dollar the city invests 
in lot revitalization, it can earn 
$2.09 in real estate value after 
only five years, which would 
more than compensate for the 
short-term debt.
Furthermore, the study re­
ports that the project will 
increase neighboring property 
values, deter crime, and improve 
community health.
One of its principal sugges­
tions is the creation of a “Clean 
and Green” coordinator, who 
would oversee the lot revital­
ization from a non-political 
standpoint.
The study suggests restoring 
the lots by turning them into 
parks, gardens, farms, produce 
markets, and flower stands, all

Declining Interest Rates on Student Loans, 2007 - 2011

House votes to cut student loan interest
by Michael R. Fitzgerald 
Staffwriter
For Carnegie Mellon students 
taking on thousands of dollars 
in debt, relief might be just a few 
hundred feet away. The House of 
Representatives passed a bill cut­
ting federal student loan interest 
rates in half on January 17. The 
bill is now making its way across 
the Capitol, awaiting approval by 
the Senate and President Bush. 
From there, a short trip down 
Pennsylvania Avenue, past Presi­
dent Bush’s desk, and graduates 
will get a little more breathing 
room each month.
However, Senate Democrats 
may introduce their o^n bill by
February, The Wall Street Journal 
reported last Monday.
The House version, called H.R. 
5: College Student Relief Act, 
would gradually lower interest 
rates from 6.8 to 3.4 percent by 
2011. The change will only af­
fect subsidized loans, such as 
Stafford loans. The government 
has always covered the interest 
accumulating on these loans un­
til the borrower graduates.
Around 5.5 million students 
will be affected. In Pennsylva­
nia alone, there are 211,832 
Stafford loan recipients, most of 
whom are from families earning 
less than $68,000 a year, said 
Pittsburgh Representative Milce 
Doyle (D-Pa.).
“We’re trying to start wfcSi the
neediest first, for those eligible 
for subsidized student loans,” 
Doyle said.
He added that Pell Grants were 
next on the agenda.
H.R. 5 passed 356-71 with bi­
partisan support and unanimous 
Democrat approval. However, 
the bill saw growing opposition 
as it was rushed to a vote.
Opponents complained that 
the bill falls short of Democratic 
campaign promises.
According to Doyle, the bill 
was part of the new Democratic 
majority’s aggressive opening 
salvo of bills that skipped com­
mittee review. Republicans and 
the Bush administration wanted

A college paper’s 
opinion counts
It is generally understood that the 
meat of a newspaper should be about 
reporting the facts in an interesting, but 
ultimately accurate, way. That is what 
sets apart a newspaper from a tabloid. 
You can believe that the news you’re 
getting from a newspaper is true. And if 
you prefer a tabloid to a newspaper as 
a source of accurate information, then 
you have a problem.
But what is perhaps a more enliven­
ing function of a newspaper is its role 
as a forum for educated opinions and 
thoughts. The Tartan is no stranger to 
this concept. Our opinion page is actu­
ally called “Forum.” It is here where 
you can find a collection of student 
opinions, editorial cartoons, and even 
the opinion of the newspaper.
Yes, newspapers have opinions; we 
just give readers the benefit of being 
able to discern between what is fact 
and what is opinion by publishing our 
opinions as editorials. But it’s not all 
fun and games in the world of opinion 
writing. With serious freedoms come 
serious responsibilities. And sometimes 
it becomes unclear where a college 
newspaper can go awry.
In yet another week of journalistic 
experimentation across the country, a 
university newspaper tried to be edgy 
and humorous, but ended up failing 
miserably. Princeton University’s news­
paper, The Daily Princetonian, generated 
and printed content in their humor 
issue that was seen by many as insensi­
tive and offensive.
The paper poked fun at a previously 
rejected applicant who then filed a law­
suit against the university because he 
believed the school had rejected him on 
grounds of racial discrimination. But 
instead of making light of the more ap­
propriate points of contention (such as 
the idea of suing a university because of* 
rejection), the paper made the careless 
mistake of commenting primarily on 
the student’s Asian ethnicity. The pa­
per had produced a mock letter, full of 
stereotypical broken English. And while 
the paper never came out and said, “We 
think this person fits the stereotype,” its 
writers most certainly were acting on a 
preconceived opinion.
And while the article probably was 
not meant to be taken seriously (it was, 
after all, printed as part of a humor 
issue), it demonstrates how readers 
look to a paper as a source of truth, or at 
least of educated viewpoints. So it must 
have come as quite a shock to readers 
when The Daily Princetonian’s readers 
found that the article contained more 
ignorance than actual humor.
Opinions have the power to elicit 
emotion from people. Imagine all of 
the people who would be affected by an 
opinion if it was part of The New York 
Times; imagine all the people who were 
affected by the opinion of The Daily 
Princetonian.
Because a newspaper’s opinion is so 
powerful, I believe newspapers have 
the responsibility of sharing their opin­
ions, but only when they are based 
soundly upon facts. Newspapers should 
have a distinct voice, but this should be 
done so in a strictly regulated fashion, 
specifically because of its potential to 
affect so many readers.
The Tartan’s editorial board com­
prises seven members who have a large 
stake in the paper, such as editors and 
managers. The board meets behind 
closed doors in order to generate free 
thought in its purest form; the board’s 
members are not afraid to say what they 
think, even if it varies from the norm.
Perhaps more importantly, the col­
laborative effort of the board members 
results in a purely Tartan point of view; 
there are no outside influences, only 
the newspaper’s opinion. And you can 
bet that opinion is based on facts, even 
if you don’t agree with it.
Shawn Wertz, publisher of The Tartan, 
welcomes all responsible questions and 
comments, which may be sent to pub-

Campus News in Brief
President Cohort appointed to federal advisory committee
After serving more than two years on the 
Homeland Security Advisory Council, Carnegie 
Mellon President Jared L. Cohon was appointed 
the chairman of the Secure Borders and Open 
Doors Advisory Committee, the Department 
of Homeland Security and the Department of 
State announced last month.
The new committee will help develop federal 
policies regarding how people from other coun­
tries come into the United States for a multitude 
of reasons, President Cohon stated in a January
5 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education.
The committee is made up of 18 members 
from academia, the tourism industry, health 
care, and the private sector, according to the 
Department of Homeland Security’s website.
John S. Chen will serve as the committee’s co- 
chejir. Chen is the president and CEO of Sybase, 
a company specializing in the development of 
wireless technology. He serves on the board of 
directors of the San Francisco Symphony, the US 
Chamber of Commerce, the President’s Export 
Council, and the Walt Disney Company, and is 
actively involved in the international relations 
of the United States and China, according to the 
Department of Homeland Security’s website.
Other members of the committee include 
Jay Rasulo, chairman of Walt Disney Parks and 
Resorts, and J.W. Marriott, chairman and chief 
executive officer of Marriott International, In­
corporated. Prior to his work for Disney, Rasulo 
served on the United States Travel and Tour­
ism Advisory Board, and also worked for the 
Marriott Corporation. Marriott has served on 
the President’s Export Council and the United 
States Travel and Tourism Advisory Board.
From academia and health care, members 
are Eduardo J. Padron, president, Miami-Dade 
Community College; Dr. Paul B. Roth, executive 
vice president for Health Services, University of 
New Mexico; Roxane Cohen Silver, professor 
of psychology, University of California, Irvine; 
Rose Mary Valencia, director, Office of Inter­
national Affairs, University of Texas Health 
Science Center; and Charles Vest, president

Student loan interest rates cut in half
LOAN, from Al
to spend more money on grants for the most needy 
students, the Associated Press reported in a Janu­
ary 18 article.
The 3.4 percent interest rate would only be in ef­
fect for six months once reached in 2011, at which 
point it would require a renewal. This is a change 
from the Democrats’ original plan, which had 
promised an immediate, not gradual, drop to 3.4 
percent that would be in effect for four years.
United States Congressman Buck McKeon (R- 
Calif.), a ranking member on the House Education 
and Labor Committee, declined to comment.
“I’d rather see Pell Grants go up,” said William 
Elliott, Carnegie Mellon vice-president of enroll­
ment, when asked if he would rather see increased 
gift aid going to lower-income students or more 
subsidized loans for middle- to lower-income stu­
dents.
“It’s the difference between giving someone a 
chance, or someone else a choice.... We don’t have 
many Pell grant recipients [at Carnegie Mellon],” 
Elliott said.
Senator Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) last week 
proposed an increase in the maximum possible 
Pell Grant from $4,050 to $5,100, MSNBC.com re­
ported.
“I heard comments [that] we should be doing Pell
Grants instead of this. My reply to those detractors 
[is], what have they done in the last 12 years? For 
12 years, the other side had power to change inter­
est, increase Pell Grants,” Doyle said.
The average student graduates with $17,500 in 
unpaid loans, which is a 45 percent increase from
11 years ago, according to the House Committee on 
Education and Labor website.
According to the terms of H.R. 5, a student leav­
ing school with subsidized loans this year would 
begin paying back that money at an interest rate of 
6.12 percent. Each year, the interest rate will de­
crease between 0.5 and 0.7 percent until 2011. Six 
months later, a new rate would be set.
It is unclear what a Senate version of the bill 
might look like.
“Congress is so new, you don’t know who the 
power brokers are yet,” Elliott said.
Kennedy’s proposal from last week, which 
includes the Pell Grant increases, featured a 
sweetened-up deal for college graduates: a cap on 
loan payments at a percentage of income, loan for­
giveness after 25 years, and an increase in tuition 
tax deduction, The Washington Post reported last 
Friday.
The Post warned of looming battles between 
Congress and lenders such as Sallie Mae, who ar­
gue that students are seeing improvements with­
out such drastic changes to lending rules.

cultures,” said Margaret Szeto, 
a senior in design and human- 
computer interaction who is the

for Big Straw. “And for the sake 
of each individual and for the 
Asian-American community on 
campus, having a forum like Big 
Straw can fill in a lot of gaps, 
bridge people together, and em­
power future leaders.”
Asian-interest student orga­
nizations at Carnegie Mellon 
welcome membership from stu­
dents of any origin; several boast 
officers who are non-Asian.
“Numerous officers have 
been non-Asian or Caucasian,” 
said Lu Zhang, a junior in busi­
ness administration and former 
president of ASA. “We are always 
trying to encourage students 
that are not Asian to join us.”
In this sense, Carnegie Mellon 
is at the forefront of the nation­
wide effort among universities 
to integrate students of differ­
ent ethnicities. Students at other 
colleges have been barred from 
joining Asian student organi­
zations. Some groups restrict 
membership to specific ethnic 
groups; for example, Chinese, 
Taiwanese, or Korean, according 
to Tomazic.
Tomazic feels that the only 
reason why restriction may be 
sometimes appropriate is that 
non-Asian students may lack 
understanding of Asian culture. 
“I do recognize that a lot of the 
issues that [Asian student orga­
nizations] talk about are very 
sensitive issues that could be mis­
construed if you yourself haven’t 
been immersed in the culture,” 
Tomazic said. “For example, 
someone who’s not Chinese or 
Asian may not understand how 
you feel when someone calls you 
a chink.”
At Carnegie Mellon, Asian 
student groups seem to have the 
opposite problem. Some groups 
that are interested in attracting 
members of various races have 
experienced limited success di­
versifying their memberships.
“It’s a good thing that we do 
have all these different Asian 
groups, and it’s definitely im­
portant to have an awareness 
of each individual culture,” said
Paul Nguyen, a junior in business 
administration and the head of 
VSA. “At the same time, it some­
times only attracts members of 
that group.”
The divisions deter students of 
other races as well as other Asian 
students of different countries of 
origin.
“For example, when I say we 
really try to open VSA to every­
body ... [some students say], ‘Oh 
well, I’m not Vietnamese, so I 
can’t be in VSA.’ So I’m sure it’s 
the same way about KSA. I can 
definitely understand it’s a natu­
ral reaction,” Nguyen said.
In fact, many Asian students at 
Carnegie Mellon claim they have 
only been discriminated against 
by students of other Asian ethnic 
divisions.
“Within Asian groups, there 
are divisions,” Zhang said. “I’ve 
suffered discrimination from 
within Asian groups, but not 
from non-Asian groups.” 
However, the belief that Asian 
students tend to befriend only 
other Asian students may be 
overly stereotypical.
Asian students such as Zhang 
report no problems befriending 
students that are not familiar 
with Asian culture. “They didn’t 
know any Asian people before 
they met me,” Zhang said. “But 
now that we’ve gotten to know 
each other, we’re like brothers.” 
“Only some Asian students 
choose to associate with only 
other Asians. It’s half and half,” 
Nguyen said. “Generally, I would 
say they only hang out with 
Asians or they hang out with ev­
eryone else, and not necessarily 
with the Asian-Asians.”
Students are divided over 
who is to blame for such 
self-segregation.
“Whether or not it’s the Asian 
student’s fault... that’s arguable,” 
Zhang said. “It’s overgeneraliz­
ing, but stereotypes come from 
somewhere. Yeah, there may 
be Asian students that only as­
sociate with Asian students, but 
there may also be Caucasian stu­
dents that only associate with 
Caucasian students.”
The administration has cre­
ated several campus initiatives 
to promote diversity on campus, 
such as the Multicultural Initia­
tives division of Student Affairs,
which includes the Multicultural 
Presidents Council, a group that 
brings together leaders of dif­
ferent student organizations to 
promote diversity.
“I’m part of the Multicul­
tural Presidents Council,” said 
Nguyen. “That’s something we’re 
working on — bringing diversity 
to everybody. It shouldn’t be just 
an Asian thing. In our particular 
case, there’s not that many Viet­
namese. So we definitely reach 
out to everybody and anybody.”
In addition, there is the Diver­
sity Advisory Council, chaired by 
Carnegie Mellon President Jared 
Cohon. The council’s role is to 
“assess the status of diversity at 
Carnegie Mellon [and] study the 
issues and challenges associated 
with increasing diversity at the 
university,” according to its web­
site.
Some Asian students reported 
that being in an environment 
with many other Asian students 
has changed their perspective, 
which many see as a potential 
benefit to attending a school with 
such a substantial Asian popula­
tion like Carnegie Mellon.
“It definitely had an influence 
on me. I actually came in rather 
white-washed. I came from an 
area with not many Asians,” said 
Nguyen. “Coming here was defi­
nitely a new experience for me. It 
gave me a different perspective 
now that I wasn’t entirely the 
minority anymore.”
“White-washed” is a term used 
by some Asians to describe a per­
son of a different ethnicity that 
has disregarded their culture of 
origin in favor of adopting West­
ern culture.
There is a natural tendency 
among people to stick with mem­
bers of one’s own group, whether 
the group is of race, religion, 
major, or other interests, Vice- 
President of Enrollment William 
Elliott noted.
“Athletes have the tendency to 
hang together also,” he said. “Af- 
rican-Americari kids do the same 
thing. It’s natural.”
“But on the other hand,” El­
liott continued, “if we go beyond 
what’s natural and use the op­
portunity to learn from one 
another, it’s fascinating what 
you can learn if you just ask a lot 
of questions.”

THE TARTAN • JANUARY 29, 2007
Project revitalizes city’s vacant land
Justin Brown/Photo Editor
Students have planted trees on this former vacant site, across the street from still-vacant land in the Hill District.
GREEN, from Al
of which can be run by the com­
munity.
Several community groups 
have already purchased lots and 
begun to rejuvenate them.
Steel City Biofuels has used 
its land to plant canola and mus­
tard, which absorb contaminant 
metals through their roots and 
stalks in an attempt to remediate 
contaminated soil. Additionally, 
the company has started teach­
ing Pittsburgh’s homeowners 
how to begin this process in their 
own yards.
The Rosedale Block Center, 
based in Homewood, has turned 
its 40 purchased lots into gar­
dens and nature centers. Since
the 1990s, the center has edu­
cated nearly 600 youths on the 
importance of green practices in 
the community.
The city’s Department of Fi­
nance has created a “side yard 
sale” option for its residents in 
which they can purchase an ad­
jacent city-owned property for 
only $200. Since the program 
was started in 1995, the depart­
ment has sold more than 450 
side yards.
In addition, the department’s 
“garden waiver” program allows 
residents to garden on any city- 
owned lot free of charge.
However, there are numerous 
barriers to the completion of the 
project, such as the complexity 
of acquiring city-owned land, an
incomplete picture of the vacant 
land, and lack of funding for re­
vitalization efforts.
Still, the group remains opti­
mistic.
“The longer the topic stays 
in the public’s radar, the more 
likely the city will continue to 
make vacant lots a priority,” said 
public policy student Lori Gaido, 
one of the project’s leaders.
“The city of Pittsburgh is con­
tinuing their commitment to the 
project by following our policy 
recommendations,” Wildfire 
added. “Most notably, [the city is] 
beginning work on a pilot project 
that will prove the return on in­
vestment value of a comprehen­
sive ‘clean and green’ strategy 
for the city’s vacant lots.”

“I’m a biologist, and the con­
nection between biology and how 
it’s connected to the public isn’t 
really there,” said Conroy, who 
is an English minor. “I wanted to 
take something I was interested 
in and write about it.”
Conroy said she believes her 
article was chosen because it is a 
new and interesting idea that is 
not on the public’s radar yet but 
applicable to everyone. She also 
did her research, including the 
opinions of four experts on the 
subject.
Conroy is currently finishing
her second article for the journal, 
which is about carbon nanotubes 
that can detect and destroy bio­
logical weapons.
“[Writing] was a great learn­
ing experience,” she said. “I’m 
going to stay involved as long as
I can.”
Goldberger and Djukic are 
staying busy too, submitting 
their writers’ third drafts to Cor­
nell for this semester’s upcoming 
issue. The two predict that the 
new journal will be in print by 
the beginning of the fall 2007 
semester.
In addition, they have been 
updating the journal’s website,
h ttp://www. thetriplehelix. org, 
which posts articles that are too 
timely to be included in the print 
issue.
Beginning this semester, 
Djukic will be working on 
implementing a science policy di­
vision of the organization, which 
will encourage all chapters to 
bring policy-related events to 
their campuses.
“We want to create a global 
forum for science in society,” 
Djukic said.
Djukic and Goldberger encour­
age students who are interested 
in writing for The Triple Helix to 
e-mail them at mdjukic@.

Move over, Sandstorm and 
Highlander, Carnegie Mellon’s 
robots that participated in a 
mock military mission through 
the Mojave Desert in 2005. 
There’s a new car on the block, 
and it has more power than ei­
ther of them.
Meet Boss, Tartan Racing’s 
latest entry to the Defense 
Advanced Research Projects 
Agency’s (DARPA) Grand Chal­
lenge. DARPA’s Grand Chal­
lenge is an annual competition, 
set this year for November 3, 
which pits self-driving vehicles 
against each other on a course 
that simulates military supply 
missions in a variety of envi­
ronments.
Most students on campus 
have probably heard of Carn­
egie Mellon’s Red Team and 
its exploits in the Grand Chal­
lenge over the past years. The 
team this year, however, was 
intended to be broader-based 
than the Red Team, involving 
more faculty than before. By­
ron Spice, co-director of me­
dia relations for the School of 
Computer Science, said that 
the name Tartan Racing was 
chosen to differentiate this 
year’s team from the Red Team, 
even though it is still being led 
by professor William “Red” 
Whittaker and includes some 
veterans of the Red Team.
Whereas the previous two 
Grand Challenges have been 
held in the desert, this year’s 
Grand Challenge ups the ante 
by moving the course to a city 
setting — hence rendering the 
name DARPA Urban Challenge. 
The differences between this 
year’s challenge and previous 
challenges are significant. In 
particular, the harsh winds and 
treacherous dunes in the desert 
course have been replaced with 
traffic and a maze of confusing 
roadways in the urban course.
Electrical and computer engi­
neering major Ziv Wolkowicki, 
who is currently working on 
developing software for the ro­
bot’s sensors, said, “This race is 
significantly different.... Vehi­
cles have to do things that they 
didn’t have to do before.” The 
robot, for instance, will need

This past week, Carnegie 
Mellon researchers unveiled 
an interactive website, Traffic 
STATS, that shows how the num­
ber of traffic fatalities in the U.S. 
varies across different catego­
ries, including age and time of 
day.
The website resulted from a
arship from IBM. The Carnegie 
Mellon team consists of sopho­
mores Young Sub Bae and Nate 
Bauernfeind and first-year Law­
rence Tan.
The contest began at the uni­
versity level. According to ACM, 
300,000 students took part in 
university-level competition this 
season.
Then, each university sent its 
top teams to compete against 
other universities in the regional 
competition. Carnegie Mellon’s 
team placed second out of 116 
teams in the regional competi­
tion at the University of Cincin-
collaboration between the re­
searchers and the AAA Foun­
dation for Traffic Safety. The 
researchers intend to provide 
people with different perspec­
tives on U.S. traffic fatalities 
by improving risk information 
available to policymakers and 
the public.
The website was unveiled at 
the 86th annual meeting of the 
Transportation Research Board, 
which took place January 21-25 
in Washington, D.C. The website 
had originally started as an In-
nati, beating upperclassmen and 
graduate students.
Carnegie Mellon professor and 
team coach Greg Kesden said, 
“Over the years, more schools in 
the U.S. have gotten involved.” 
Consequently, the contest has 
become more competitive.
In the regional and world 
competitions, university teams 
are asked to solve eight real- 
world problems and develop 
tests for these programs in five 
hours. The judges accept only 
correct submissions from teams, 
and teams that submit incorrect 
answers are penalized.
formation Systems senior class 
project.
“The idea of the website was 
to create an internet tool that 
people could use to access the 
various factors that go into traf­
fic fatalities,” Randy Weinberg 
said. Weinberg is the program 
director of Information Systems 
at Carnegie Mellon.
Student researchers used two 
nationwide databases to deter­
mine the information provided 
on Traffic STATS: Fatality Re­
porting Analysis System (FARS)
A team’s placement depends 
on how many programs the 
team solves, and in the case of a 
tie, the team with the lower time 
wins.
Bauernfeind said that the 
hardest part about the regional 
competition was communicat­
ing with his teammates about 
how to approach the problems. 
“Every problem had a different 
twist or something special to it,” 
he said.
Bauernfeind also said that 
each person took one problem,

nually records every vehicle-re­
lated fatality that occurs in the 
U.S. It also includes various con­
ditions, such as the type of road 
and number of passengers in­
volved in the collision. NHTS, on 
the other hand, is a sample sur­
vey that asks people about their 
driving habits, such as mode of 
transportation and traveling 
distance.

Birth control pills 
given no standard
This week, the Food and 
Drug Administration’s board of 
health advisers refused to im­
pose a numerical standard on 
the success rate of birth control 
medications that are allowed on 
the market.
This decision could lead to 
the marketing of medications 
that are less effective than those 
currendy available.
According to experts, 
next-generation prescriptions 
will include lower amounts of 
estrogen and progestin, two 
hormones known to increase 
the pills’ success rate while also 
causing clotting and stroke. 
With reduced level of hor­
mones, women taking these 
new prescriptions should be 
less likely to experience blood 
clotting or stroke.
Though the new pills are in­
tended to be safer than their 
predecessors, doctors are 
uncertain that the reported 12 
million women taking birth 
control to prevent pregnancies 
will see the glass as half full.
Those who will benefit, how­
ever, are the women who take 
the pill for other reasons, such 
as acne treatment and men­
strual cycle regulation.

Scientists link brain 
to smoking impulse
Scientists have a new lead 
on the neurology behind ciga­
rette addiction. The insula, a 
prime-sized region of the brain 
near the ear, is now thought 
to be a critical component in 
causing addictive behavior.
After sustaining an injury to 
the insula, stroke victims are 
sometimes able to quit smok­
ing with effortless ease. As one 
patient put it, he simply “forgot” 
his usual cravings for cigarettes.
Doctors are hoping this 
breakthrough will lead to new 
methods of treatments for 
cigarette addiction. More­
over, they suspect that the 
brain’s insula plays the same 
central role in addictions to 
certain other substances, in­
cluding alcohol and cocaine.

MySpace to begin 
verifying user ages
Hoping to create a safer on­
line environment, MySpace is 
exploring options to verify the 
ages of its users.
At the forefront of this possi­
bility is a system called Zephyr, 
a monitoring software that will 
allow parents to see how old 
their children are claiming to be 
without granting access to their 
profiles and messages. Though 
MySpace is not the only website 
of its kind, it is by far the largest, 
boasting a user population of 55 
million individuals.
On the other hand, a task 
force composed of the attorneys 
general from 34 U.S. states is 
worried that Zephyr will do too 
little to protect young users. The 
program could be easily outwit­
ted, the attorneys argue, from a 
friend’s house or alternate fam­
ily computer.
In fact, the attorneys are 
pushing for a more thorough 
method of verification, perhaps 
requiring license or credit card 
information from parents to 
confirm their children’s ages. 
They also recommended that 
the site raise its minimum age 
from 14 to 16.

How Things Work: Man-Made Weather
Elizabeth Schwartz 
& Sarah Mogin
Man-made snow
Snow gun, snow cannon, snow maker: 
Call it what you want, just don’t call 
it artificial. • Snow produced by these 
machines is still snow — it’s just man- 
made.
Natural snow that falls from the sky 
forms crystals that consist of six arm-like 
structures, called dendrites. This dif­
fers from the composition of man-made 
snow, which is denser and theoretically 
more durable than natural snow.
There are two basic kinds of snow 
makers. One requires a compressed air 
supply, while the other uses a fan.
A snow maker produces snow by com­
pressing air and water in the machine’s 
body at a temperature below 30°F. The 
precise mix of water and air depends on 
the day’s humidity and temperature.
The air then breaks up the water 
stream into miniscule droplets and si­
multaneously blows them out into the 
surrounding air. Once they leave the 
machine, the droplets turn into snow, 
which falls to the ground. Mountain 
resorts with a lot of land to cover often 
transport piles of snow to other areas of 
the mountain, where machines groom 
the snow.
Snow makers also produce two types 
of snow, wet and dry. Wet snow sticks to 
everything, whereas dry snow is suitable 
for winter sports.
The airless snow gun, also called a 
snow fan, works like an amusement park 
spray fan. Water goes into the machine, 
atomizes, freezes, and is then blown out 
of the machine by an enormous fan.
Snowmaking equipment isn’t just 
for ski slopes anymore. At the pri.\e of
David Kjos/Art Editor
Snow makers produce man-made snow by compessing water and air into droplets of snow.
$2400, the Blizzard Sport snow maker 
will turn even the blandest of backyards 
into a winter wonderland.
Backyard Blizzard, the company that 
sells this snow maker, claims that with 
the help of an ordinary garden hose, 
Blizzard Sport produces 50 cubic feet of 
snow per hour. In comparison, a com­
mercial snow maker produces 20,000 
cubic feet of snow in under 20 minutes.
Man-made precipitation
Sometimes, the best way to change the 
weather is to go straight to the source. 
In a method called cloud seedMg, sub-
stances are added to clouds to induce 
rain or snow.
Most of the time, scientists induce pre­
cipitation in clouds with the compound 
silver iodide, which is similar in compo­
sition to ice crystals naturally formed in 
clouds.
Silver iodide can either be fired into 
clouds from rockets on the ground or de­
posited directly using planes that release 
silver iodide flares into clouds.
Once there, the silver iodide causes the 
supercooled liquid inside of the cloud to 
freeze through a process called heterog­
enous nucléation. This is the process by 
which a system begins to transition from
on phrase of matter to another.
Other materials, including dry ice and 
propane gas, can cause the temperature 
of an entire cloud — not just the liquid 
inside it — to decrease to lower than 
-40° C. This cooling process causes ho­
mogenous nucleation, which is similar 
to heterogeneous nucleation except that 
it occurs in a uniform system.
Both of these processes cause ice par­
ticles to form within clouds. The vapor 
pressure is lower over water than it is 
over ice, and consequently, when the ice 
particles become sufficiently large, the 
cloud is no longer able to support them. 
The particles exit in the form of snow, 
though they may melt into rain during 
their descent.
When rain or snow falls from a cloud 
that would not have otherwise yielded 
precipitation, the process is called 
static seeding. Static seeding typically 
occurs in mid-latitude clouds. Warm- 
season clouds, on the other hand, rely 
on a process called dynamic seeding to 
produce precipitation. Dynamic seeding 
increases the size of a cloud using heat 
that is released as a byproduct of freez­
ing.
There is no definitive proof that cloud 
seeding increases rainfall since it is im­
possible to know how much rain would 
have fallen from the clouds had they 
not been seeded. The general consen­
sus among experts, however, is that the 
seeding is worth the cost and effort.
Pouring tens of millions of dollars into 
cloud seeding, China hosts the world’s 
most comprehensive seeding system. 
Though the per capita water resources 
are 40 percent over the world average, 
northern China receives only 65 percent 
of the world’s average yearly rainfall.
Thanks to the use of silver iodide in 
forming precipitation, every cloud really 
does have a silver lining.

A8THE TARTAN • JANUARY 29, 2007
CONTEST, from A6
and then they paired up on problems that no 
teammate could solve on his own.
Tan, who competed in a similar contest in 
high school, said that programming contests 
like the ICPC are always challenging. He said 
that only one person is allowed to type at a 
time. Meanwhile, the other two teammates 
must work out solutions to their problems. 
“Keyboard time is precious,” he said.
Teammates are also free to discuss the 
problems with one another before beginning 
the program. “Sometimes, you just need a 
second opinion,” Tan said.
Tan said that the team had finished the two 
hardest problems in the regional competition 
within one minute of each other, completing 
all eight problems with a half hour to spare. 
“We just tried and we just hoped for the 
best.... It all worked out in the end,” he said.
Kesden said that the team must work to­
gether if it is to complete all of the problems.
“They need to talk about each problem to­
gether.... That’s actually one of the biggest 
challenges we find as coaches,” Kesden said. 
He said that some of the smartest students at
CMU are used to working individually.
The team has three coaches: Kesden, sys­
tems scientist Eugene Fink, and doctoral 
student Betty Chang. Kesden said that each 
coach has a different strength that he or she 
contributes to the team.
“We work together very very well.... We’ve 
really added a lot of strength and different 
strengths [this year],” Kesden said.
All of the problems in the contest are 
real-world. Bauernfeind said that one of the 
problems from the regional competition, for 
instance, asked students to create a program 
that designed a roof, given a number of divi­
sions in the roof and a set of points.
When approaching a problem, Bauern­
feind said that he tries to first figure out what 
the problem wants. Then, he uses the given 
information to determine how to solve the 
problem.
Bauernfeind said that the problems can be 
categorized into different types, such as ge­
ometry and dynamic programs. “Basically, 
in the world finals, you see different kinds of 
problems put together.”
The problems vary in difficulty. According 
to ACM, two of the problems are intended to
be solved in an hour by a first- or second-year 
student, two are intended to be solved in an 
hour by a third-year student, and two are 
intended to decide the first-place team. No 
team is expected to solve all eight problems 
in five hours.
In preparation for the world finals, Bauern­
feind said that the team is going through all 
of the world finals problem sets since 1999, 
checking their solutions with their coaches.
Tan said that the level of competition at 
world finals is much higher than at the re­
gional competition. He said that competi­
tions have to be prepared to write programs 
of all different types.
Teams that finish in the top four places 
receive gold medals. The top-scoring team 
also receives the World Champion Cup and 
$10,000.
Bauernfeind and Tan both said that they 
would be interested in participating next 
year.
“I’m excited to be in the type of environ­
ment ... where we’re working on programs 
for a purpose,” Bauernfeind said.
“It’s interesting and it’s fun,” Tan said.

Robot built for racing
ROBOTS, from A6
devices, he said.
Sandstorm and Highlander, 
Red Team’s previous entries into 
the competition, were optimized 
for operation in desert and rocky 
terrain, with strong chassis and 
rugged, weatherproof builds. 
However, Boss will be dealing 
with far less harsh environ­
ments, smoother terrain, and an 
overall less-punishing course, 
allowing for a lighter build. At 
the same time, Boss will face 
challenges that arise from rac­
ing in an urban setting.
Previous contenders in the 
DARPA Grand Challenge have 
had to navigate around ob­
stacles within a largely open 
environment and arrive at the 
finish line within a specified 
time limit. Urban Challengers, 
however, must also follow traffic 
roads and rules, severely limit­
ing their freedom of movement 
and navigation. To make things 
more difficult, Boss will also 
need to deal with moving traffic, 
traffic circles, and busy intersec­
tions without remote assistance 
and still arrive at the finishing 
point on time.
Whereas previous Grand 
Challenges were more focused 
on testing the stamina and 
endurance of the robots, this 
year’s competition places more 
emphasis on intelligent reac­
tion to a changing environment 
and computation of decisions in 
real-time. Accordingly, the new 
vehicle carries more sensors and 
computing power than the pre­
vious racers. Intelligence, not 
speed, is the essential factor for 
winning this race.
The self-driving 320-horse­
power Chevrolet Tahoe has 25 
sensors, three miles of extra wir­
ing, 10 computers with 208,000 
lines of new computer code, 64 
off-the-shelf components, and 
350 custom-built parts, plus the
car’s standard equipment. Its 
guidance system includes radar, 
laser sensors, a GPS system, and 
motion cameras to accurately 
decipher its location and detect 
nearby vehicles.
The choice of car reflects the 
team’s primary sponsor, Gen­
eral Motors. “That’s why it’s a 
Chevy,” Spice said. “Why a Ta­
hoe? Lots of room in back to 
accommodate computers, plenty 
of height to give sensors a good 
view, enough horsepower to pro­
duce the electrical power to run 
the computers, sensors, and the 
high-powered AC that keeps it 
all cool.”
Boss performed admirably in its 
first test run, which was held last 
Tuesday. The vehicle success­
fully navigated the test course 
on the LTV site at Hazelwood at 
speeds up to 20 miles per hour, 
allowing user-driven vehicles 
to pass if they arrived first and 
gracefully handling intersec­
tions.
“We run all sorts of tests,” 
Wolkowicki said, including long- 
range tests to-assess the robot’s 
level of endurance and intersec­
tion tests to make sure the robot 
yields to other vehicles when 
necessary.
DARPA will give $2 mil­
lion, $1 million, and $500,000 
awards to the top three finishers 
that complete the course within 
the six-hour time limit. How­
ever, Whittaker said that Tartan 
Racing’s main aim is not merely 
to win the reward, but, “more 
importantly, to make driving 
safer, to create new autonomous 
navigation and robotic technolo­
gies, and to change the world’s 
perception of what is possible.”
Wolkowicki said that the team 
has been progressing quickly. 
He said that many people are in­
volved in different aspects of the 
project, ranging from market­
ing to software develoment. He 
said, “People are very devoted.”

Website allows users 
to assess traffic risks
TRAFFIC, from A6
Carnegie Mellon researchers 
combined these' two databases
by weighting the number of traf­
fic fatalities recorded in FARS by 
the categories found in NHTS, 
such as traveling distance.
“Generally, people measure 
safety only by the number of fa­
talities, but a much better way 
is to think in terms of risk, for 
example, fatalities per mile,” 
said Paul Fischbeck, director of 
Carnegie Mellon’s Center for 
the Study and Improvement of 
Regulation (CSIR) in a press re­
lease.
“You get a much more realistic 
picture of the risk of traveling,” 
said Weinberg. He said that el­
derly and young drivers have 
the highest fatality risk per mile 
traveling, whereas mid-age driv­
ers, 30-50 years of age, have the 
lowest risk. >
The study turned up many 
more findings. For instance, 
motorcycles cause fewer fatali­
ties than automobiles because 
they are driven less, but per mile 
traveled, motorcylces are riskier 
than automobiles.
According to the January 12 
press release on Traffic STATS, 
SUV fatality risks are 20 per­
cent less than that of a car. 
Furthermore, the driving risks
of an 18-year-old male and an 
80-year-old female are approxi-
matelythe same-David Gerard, executive direc­
tor of CSIR, said that the website 
sheds positive light on Carnegie 
Mellon’s ability to research pol­
icy issues. “This also positions us 
a little better... to influence pub­
lic policy,” he said.
Fischbeck said that the web­
site’s interactive interface would 
not have been possible without 
today’s web technology. “You 
have millions of comparisons 
that we want to do on the fly,” 
he said. Ten years ago, Fischbeck 
said, the website would not have 
been as fast or interactive with­
out such technology.
Fischbeck said that the web­
site is interactive because each 
person is interested in accessing 
different information. The web­
site allows the user to choose 
different risk comparisons, such 
as age, day of week, and gender. 
The site then asks the user to 
specify other variables, such as 
region and transportation mode. 
It then calculates the number 
of estimated fatalities per 100 
million according to the risk 
comparisons.
“We feel people learn a lot 
better in an interactive environ­
ment,” Fischbeck said.

Princeton newspaper’s ‘joke’ issue offends
When it comes to making a statement, 
it’s hard to think of a topic more explo­
sive than that of race. While watching 
televisiori, attending a lecture, or even 
reading a college newspaper, it’s easy 
to keep a finger poised, awaiting the 
ignorant, the tasteless, and the inap­
propriate. Right now, all fingers point 
toward The Daily Princetonian, which 
offended students, alumni, and onlook­
ers alike in its annual “joke” issue.
In exaggerated, broken English, The 
Daily Princetonian published a fake letter 
under the pseudonymous byline “Lian 
Ji” on January 17. The article pokes fun 
at a real student, Jian Li, who is a first- 
year at Yale. Li was denied acceptance to 
Princeton and has issued a federal civil 
rights complaint against Princeton for 
its alleged anti-Asian racial discrimina­
tion in admissions.
The language of the letter is offen­
sive in its own right: “I the super smart 
Asian,” it reads. “Princeton the super 
dumb college, not accept me.” More­
over, the article is stuffed with tasteless 
Asian jokes, addressing the usual tired 
stereotypes concerning schoolwork, 
music lessons, and “FOBs.” Every line of 
the Lian Ji article is a disconnected jab. 
There’s no argument, no thesis to justify 
The Daily Princetonian’s attempt at sat­
ire.
It’s hard to gauge the legitimacy of 
Li’s complaint and others like it. On the 
one hand, it’s plausible that the notori­
ously exclusive Ivy League institutions 
could be rejecting Asians and Asian- 
Americans in unfair amounts. Li was 
the perfect applicant on paper: He had 
a perfect score on his SATs, good grades, 
and an impressive array of extracurricu­
lar activities.
But doesn’t everybody know at least 
one Ivy League sob story? Your friend 
the class valedictorian, 4.9 GPA, who 
cured cancer and pulls orphans out of 
burning buildings — Princeton pretty 
much rejects everybody. With so many 
applications to choose from, a lot of wor­
thy students get turned away. And this 
one wound up at Yale — boo hoo.
The point is, it would have been easy 
for The Daily Princetonian to satirize Li’s 
legal complaint. It could have addressed 
the yearly collegiate admissions frenzy, 
the melodrama surrounding rejection, 
or people’s tendency to play the “race 
card” when all else fails.
If anything, the article only rein­
forced the Ivy stigma. Members of 
The Daily Princetonian were quick to 
point out that the joke issue — and the 
paper in general — was the product of a 
diverse group of students. That may be, 
but when you read such tasteless racial 
humor, especially when it comes from a 
school like Princeton, it’s hard to imag­
ine that that’s the case.
Also inexcusable is The Daily Prince- 
tonian's initial apology, which came in 
the form of an editor’s note on January
19. “We embraced racist language in or­
der to strangle it,” the note read. A kid 
complaining about being rejected from 
an Ivy League, while it may be worth 
lampooning, is entirely unrelated to 
strangling racist language.
The method of comedy that The Daily 
Princetonian claims to have attempted 
is possible, but the newspaper didn’t do 
it. Stephen Colbert “strangles” ignorant 
language on a daily basis by becoming 
the same stubborn bigot he seeks to cut 
down. Another example is the Facebook 
group “Homophobia Is So Gay,” which 
turns the popular “That’s so gay” phrase 
on its head, exposing the senselessness 
of all who say it.
That being said, The Tartan.does not 
mean to condemn all those who take 
risks. College newspapers present a 
unique opportunity for experimenta­
tion. With their young readership and 
fast turnover rate, college newspapers 
have a unique opportunity to innovate 
and push the border's of what is accepted 
with far less risk than a professional 
newspaper would take on.
A college newspaper, however, also 
faces the burden of representing its 
entire institution. When The Daily 
Princetonian makes a mistake, Princ­
eton looks bad. In the end, its important 
to find a balance between what’s risky 
and what’s standard. We wish The Daily 
Princetonian the best of luck in finding 
that balance.
Cost of college may be decreasing
Last week, the U.S. House of Repre­
sentatives approved a bill that would 
reduce interest rates on subsidized 
Stafford loans from 6.8 percent to 3.4 
percent incrementally by 2011, at which 
point Congress will have to act to keep 
the rate from jumping back to its original 
value. But the bill, which the Senate is 
set to consider next, is a disappointingly 
light version of what some Democrats 
had promised.
Earlier this month, Senators Richard 
Durbin CD—111.) and Edward M. Kennedy 
(D-Mass.) proposed legislation that 
would additionally boost the maximum 
Pell Grant award from $4050 to $5100, 
limiting loan repayments to 15 percent 
of a borrower’s discretionary income, 
and restructuring loan programs to 
encourage the use of the government’s 
Direct Loan Program.
The changes in interest rates will, 
on average, save students graduating 
this year from a four-year college about 
$2000 over the lifetime of their loan, but 
more, dramatic measures will be critical
to bringing the cost of higher education 
under control so all young adults have 
the opportunity to go to the college they 
would like to attend, regardless of the 
cost.
For most Carnegie Mellon students, 
though, these changes are unlikely to 
let them breathe more easily, because 
it is Carnegie Mellon that falls short in 
providing for its students.
In 2005, 19 percent of the average 
student’s financial aid need went un­
met, leaving those students to close the 
gap with unsubsidized loans with higher 
interest rates. Most colleges in our peer 
set meet all of their students’ need with 
grants, self-help, and more affordable 
subsidized loans.
Among the universities Carnegie 
Mellon uses for benchmarking, only 
Cornell students graduated with more 
debt on average in 2005, according to 
self-reported data. The average Cornell 
graduate left with $27,235 in loans that 
year, while the average Carnegie Mel­
lon graduate was saddled with $26,500.
And that doesn’t include the expensive, 
privately secured loans of which the col­
leges might not have been aware. Not 
only that, but debt upon student gradua­
tion from Carnegie Mellon has increased 
much faster since 2001 than it has for 
students at our peer institutions.
Without a doubt, Carnegie Mellon 
is at a disadvantage: With such a short 
history, the university has not had 
the time to build an endowment that 
compares to that of our peers. In fact, 
the endowment supports less than 10 
percent of financial aid given each year; 
more than 50 percent comes from the 
annual operating budget. It is impressive 
that the university provides as much as 
it does, but that doesn’t change the fact 
that Carnegie Mellon must do more if it 
hopes to compete for top students.
If the Senate and President Bush 
approve the interest rate reductions, 
Congress will have taken a first step 
in the right direction. But for Carnegie 
Mellon, there’s a long road ahead before 
college becomes affordable.
Groundhog Day celebration is 
a display of animal cruelty
Michael Croland
My first Groundhog Day trek to Punx- 
sutawney, Pa., took place in 2002. At 
the time, Punxsutawney’s Groundhog 
Day spectacle seemed like the ultimate 
college road trip and as fun as the Bill 
Murray movie of the same name. But it 
wasn’t fun for the groundhog.
That year, Punxsutawney Phil alleg­
edly saw his shadow, signifying that 
there would be six more weeks of winter 
instead of an early spring. As soon as the 
announcement was made, the crowd 
changed its rabid chants of “Phil! Phil! 
Phil!” to a chorus of boos. Few people 
seemed to care about the actual animal 
involved. Punxsutawney Phil was just 
an unlucky victim of the Groundhog 
Day legend and party.
When I returned to Punxsutawney on 
February 2, 2003, the rowdy thousands 
in attendance again booed the ground­
hog following the six-more-weeks 
announcement. In the 110 years on re­
cord, numerous groundhogs named Phil 
have allegedly seen their shadows on 96 
occasions — more than 87 percent of 
the time. Booing the erstwhile hero is 
probably a near-ahnual occurrence.
Upon writing about my road trip 
later that day, I wanted to focus on the 
groundhog gathering’s fun atmosphere. 
Nevertheless, I couldn’t help but men­
tion the “animal abuse I won’t delve 
into.” Going to Punxsutawney a sec­
ond time got me thinking about Phil’s 
side of things. For the sake of the holi­
day’s namesake, we must consider the 
groundhog’s role in this whole ordeal.
The groundhog of lore is about as real 
to most people as a unicorn; they prob­
ably wouldn’t hold their beloved dogs, 
cats, or other flesh-and-blood beings 
in the same regard. Jokes about killing 
and eating Punxsutawney Phil are com­
mon even among his biggest supposed 
admirers. In The Unofficial Ground- 
hogese Dictionary — a compendium 
of groundhog legend — the ground­
hog is identified as “a delicious, large, 
rounded, sumptuous, readily eaten pe­
rennial herbivore.” Behind these jokes, 
there’s a disturbing theme: For many 
groundhog enthusiasts, Groundhog Day 
has nothing to do with concern for the 
groundhog.
It really doesn’t matter to Phil whether 
people are screaming with cheers or 
jeers at sunrise every February 2. The 
bottom line is that it’s terrifying for 
Phil to be hoisted up on stage in front 
of bright lights and thousands of loud 
spectators. “It is stressful for any wild 
animal,” said Stam Zervanos, a Penn 
State-Berks biology professor and an 
expert in groundhog physiology.
According to Zervanos, local ground­
hogs’ average “date of first emergence” 
is February 4, but the date “varies from 
year to year.” He said that it is “very un­
likely” that a groundhog would come 
out of hibernation at exactly the same 
time each year.
Without a groundhog, Punxsutaw­
ney wouldn’t have a Groundhog Day. In 
order to sustain the tourist trap, Phil is 
held captive at Punxsutawney’s public 
library and kept on display for visitors to 
gawk at. As The Unofficial Groundhogese 
Dictionary notes, long-term captivity 
can cause groundhogs at the library’s 
Groundhog Zoo to experience “strange 
anti-social behavior” that is “similar to 
‘Cabin Fever’ among humans.”
Punxsutawney Phil is not able to hi­
bernate in the middle of the woods, 
and he doesn’t magically appear from a 
burrow at “Gobbler’s Knob” at the crack 
of dawn every Groundhog Day. And in 
December 2004, when he should have 
been hibernating in the middle of the 
woods with other groundhogs, Phil was 
taken to Washington, D.C., for a press 
conference!
Preventing animals from fulfill­
ing their instinctual needs — such as 
hibernating in a natural setting dur­
ing the time frame dictated by nature
— is wrong. Forcing a wild animal to 
be at the center of a frightening, in­
timidating spectacle is likewise not ac­
ceptable. Punxsutawney’s Groundhog 
Day celebration is a textbook case of 
exploitation.
The annual New Year’s Eve Possum 
Drop in Brasstown, N.C., helped me put 
things in perspective. Each year in this 
small mountain town, several hundred 
local residents assemble as an opossum 
in a cage is dumped off the roof of Brass- 
town’s only gas station. As the confused 
and horrified animal descends, attend­
ees cheer and count down the seconds 
’til midnight. Allegedly, the animal is 
not physically harmed in the ordeal.
It’s obvious to most decent folks 
that the Possum Drop is a backward, 
inhumane event. Yet at its core, it’s simi­
lar to Punxsutawney’s Groundhog Day 
celebration. Onlookers gather around, 
cheer on wild animals kept in captivity 
when they’re not booing or joking about 
eating them, and scare these furry little 
critters in an alien environment.
It may seem easier to oppose the Pos­
sum Drop than Punxsutawney’s Ground­
hog Day spectacle, as many of us have a 
soft spot for the Groundhog Day tradi­
tion. But tradition is no excuse for cru­
elty. We must do away with cruel tradi­
tions and instead choose compassionate 
events that bring people together with­
out harming animals.

THE TARTAN • JANUARY 29, 2007Ail
Ugg boot trend stomps all over rules of fashion and taste
Jessica Thurston
Ah, the lexicon of contemporary fash­
ion. There are ankle-length skirts, which 
stunt the growth of about half of all 
women who wear them. There are denim 
jackets, which make all but the most pro­
portionate torsos appear boxy. There is 
even a comeback of skinny jeans, which 
expand the girth of 90 percent of women’s 
legs, while implicitly evoking a desire for 
the re-emergence of the words “rad” and 
“tubular.” (I, still, am a fan of all ’80s 
trends. Really.) But none of these awk­
ward fashion trends, not even drawstring 
sweatpants with polyester patches across 
the knee, irk me like the non-conformity 
of Ugg boots.
And by non-conformity, I don’t mean in 
terms of style. I mean in terms of fit. As in 
calves, ankles, and feet. The human body 
is what clothes are supposed to cater to. 
The Carnegie Mellon student body, which 
suffers under unfortunate gray weather, 
chooses even more unfortunate footwear 
options for these perilous winter months.
First of all, camel brown: Really? Camel 
brown is almost the color of feet, but ei­
ther too dark or too light or too faded 
to really match. And rough suede as a 
material choice? Hey, let’s make a non- 
supple fabric that feels like dry skin in the 
wintertime!
In addition to what Ugg® Australia 
calls their signature “Antique Light Chest­
nut” color (a.k.a. a last-minute excuse for 
a mix-up between camel and pure evil), 
these clunky boots are showing up all 
over campus in such colors as sea-foam 
green, fluorescent lavender, and dusty 
light blue. While they all are lovely hues 
(minus the fluorescent lavender), should 
sheepskin really be these colors? I would 
be absolutely terrified to visit that acid 
trip of a farm.
Even more important than the color or 
material of footwear, however, is its fit — 
its relationship to the human body. Boots
emerged as a form of foot protection 
meant to seal the foot against wet rain and 
dirty snow, support and protect the ankle 
against the elements, and be suitable 
for long walks along crooked sidewalks 
and pot-holed city streets. Boots did not 
emerge as a footwear structure meant to 
be a burden: heavy, overly rigid in form, 
and louder than a fire-engine red slicker. 
Instead of drawing the material in and the 
eye toward the pivotal points of the foot 
— the toe area, the ankle area, and the calf 
area — Ugg boots start with a boxy shape 
around the toes and never really change. 
There is no tapering around the ankle or 
the calf, and the women wearing them ap­
pear to have stumpy half-camel-half-evil 
mutants for feet. Ugg® Australia by Brian 
Smith, women are curvy! Give us some 
shape!
Ugg boots are certainly not the only 
example of a mass-produced clothing 
trend that focuses more on marketing 
and popularity than the real purposes 
behind designing clothing and footwear. 
Diane von Furstenberg’s infamous 1970s 
wrap dress flatters only the tallest, thin­
nest of women, but continues to influence 
millions of other designs. And platform 
sandals are fabulous, yes, but absurd. 
That kind of height and lack of support 
around the ankle is nothing but a recipe 
for a trendy disaster. But boots are not 
strappy sandals or cocktail dresses. They 
should nurture and protect, not create 
pop culture conformists and extremely 
clunky walkers out of their wearers. Uggs 
also feature product names like “Vene­
zia,” “Firenze,” “Milano,” and “Roma.” 
Is this Australia or Italy? Has suburbia’s 
style gone horribly wrong? Uggs scream 
‘identity crisis.’
This identity crisis carries over to an is­
sue of appropriateness in wearability. Far 
too often, I see women pairing an uber- 
short denim mini skirt with Ugg boots. 
Who said this was a good idea? Are your 
thighs and your ankles in two entirely dif­
ferent climates?
Even better (or horribly, horribly worse) 
than the typical Ugg boots are the new 
furry monsters decorating shoe depart­
ments nationwide. The new Ugg boot 
is none other than the disturbing “Fluff 
Momma.” I kid you not. FLUFF MOMMA. 
What a ridiculously awful, overpriced 
joke.
The decadent “Fluff Momma” boot fea­
tures three inches of stringy, fleecy fun. 
At mid-calf, its circumference is 13 inches 
- wide enough for at least seven more 
legs to fit inside its fluffy, hollowed-out 
monster-leg shape. The best part of this 
atrocity is that a single pair costs no less 
than $300, which is probably the same 
amount you spent on books this semester. 
To pass a class or to become a half-furry 
mutant? It’s really a toss-up.
The act of encountering people will­
ing to wear such boots is not even what 
scares me the most. Not even close. What 
I’m truly scared of are the colorful am-
?anielle Saudino/Art Staff
putee mega muppets hobbling around 
somewhere. Whoever stole the lower legs 
of those black, cornflower blue, natural, 
orchid, and pink monsters is going to seri­
ously pay.
So please, consider this a grave warning. 
Stay warm, yes. Don’t slip on the half-inch 
layer of slush glossing every outdoor sur­
face, of course. But even more important: 
Retain your. individuality. Choose foot­
wear that fits! Choose footwear you trust! 
Avoid the plague of Uggs and the amputee 
muppets that follow.
And never, ever wear chunky boots with 
a denim skirt. Seriously, just don’t.

priced, snug-fitting boots. She is especially 
fond of her wonderful brown ones.
Pun intended: Even Jesus enjoys the occasional pun
Sarah Mogin & Kristen Lukiewski
Sigmund Freud once said that 
the pun was the lowest form of 
humor. But Freud’s leather couch 
be damned — the man was sofa 
king wrong. What’s the real low­
est form of humor? Anyone could 
tell you that at least mimes are 
worse. They must have slipped 
Freud’s mind — you know, kind 
of like how a piano could slip off 
of a ten-story building... onto a 
mother-effing mime. Talk about 
your edifice wrecks.
Oh, mimes. Even if they seem 
sharp, at the end they’ll always 
B-flat. What’s black and white 
and red all over? A bludgeoned 
mime — here’s hoping he was an 
organ donor.
The point is, a pun never 
trapped anyone inside an invis­
ible glass box, a pun never put 
honey in your shampoo, and a 
pun never put a whoopee cushion 
on your seat. Puns span genres. 
Puns translate well to ‘print (see 
above). Mimes, on the other 
hand, are very one-dimensional. 
Let’s take an in-depth look at a 
mime’s routine in print:
Exactly.
Puns have been ridiculed for 
centuries by figures as promi­
nent as Freud and Coleridge. In 
addition to being called the low­
est form of humor, puns have 
also been noted to not excite any 
response, from those whose ears 
they have graced. Shakespeare 
made puns. After being stabbed, 
Romeo and Juliet’s Mercutio re­
ally gets to the point of the mat­
ter: “Ask for me tomorrow and 
you shall find me a grave man.” 
Leslie Neilsen is another ex­
ample of a pun pioneer. Surely,
Dan Quayle, spelling “potato” 
with an “e.” That joke must have 
been so good that none of us can 
ever figure out what he meant by 
it. Oh, wait. They’re just idiots. 
Well, at least it proves that the 
pun can serve as a clever alibi 
for those of us who aren’t terribly 
bright.
Jonathan Swift, of Gulliver’s 
Travels fame, found puns so wor­
thy of positive attention that he 
wrote A Modest Defense of Pun­
ning. He used puns in most of 
his work, and was proud of his
pun, and also that the punner 
must be the first to laugh at his 
own joke — which means that 
puns are good for self-gratifica- 
tion, too!
Puns are more versatile than 
other jokes. They can be aca­
demic in a primarily literary 
sense because of the double en­
tendres they create, but they 
can be used profitably in a social 
context, too. They may even help 
you further your career. Witness 
the following conversations:
Mermaid: So [winks], do you
Puns have been ridiculed for centuries by figures as 
prominent as Freud and Coleridge.
almost all the humor in Airplane 
is pun-based. (And we’re sorry 
for calling you Shirley.) Even 
Jesus made puns. In Greek, the 
spelling of the name Peter and 
the word “rock” only differ by 
one letter, so who better for Je­
sus to ask to make the rock upon 
which his church would be built 
than — yes — Peter. Christ, 
that’s clever.
Politicians also make puns. 
Take George W. Bush for ex­
ample. “Nucular War.” Note the 
subtle “nuke” — hilarious! Or
ability to make puns in mul­
tiple languages — he believed 
that it proved his adeptness at 
language and showed his large 
vocabulary.
If you’re a pun enthusiast, you 
can even find rules for punning. 
Thomas Sheridan wrote two 
pieces on puns, one called Ars 
Pun-ica, and one called The Art 
of Punning. The Art of Punning 
includes 34 rules for making 
puns, which concede that a pun­
ner may interrupt a conversation 
at any point in order to make a

[sighs], but she’s abroad, so... 
Mermaid: c’Ouch that’s cold. 
And you’re sofa king hot! Sailor: 
You’re taking my bait. Let’s hook 
up. Mermaid: It’s about time! I 
love seamen!
Daughter: Hey, Mom! Mother: 
Hay is for horses. Daughter: 
Yeah, but Mom! Mother: Yabuts 
live in the woods. Daughter: Eff 
you. Mother: I don’t know how 
to letter myself.
Patient: Doctor, try to have a 
little patience. Doctor: Children?
Not my specialty. Patient: Suture 
self. Doctor: Right. Anyway, 
we’ve tried everything. Even an 
IV, but it was all in vein. Patient: 
At least you didn’t bypass the op­
portunity. Weren’t you going to 
put me in a cast? Doctor: Yeah, 
but I was plastered.
Man, that conversation really 
left us in stitches.
Pilot #1: Do you roger? Pilot 
#2: What? I’m Frank. Pilot #1: 
Well, I appreciate your candor. 
Do you copy? Pilot #2: No, that 
doesn’t fly with me. I do my own 
work, and I always pass with 
flying colors. Pilot #1: Ah, im­
pressive. It’s good to have friends 
in high places. I’m Jack, by the 
way. Pilot #2: Sweet. Hi, Jack! 
Pilot #1: A hijack!? I always 
thought I’d die from a terminal 
illness.
Wow, that conversation really 
took off.
When it comes to puns, there’s 
nothing to lose. If a joke ever 
falls flat, the only punishment is 
coming up with a new one. Why 
be a fraud (like Freud) when you 
can be Swift? Just remember, the 
pun is mightier than the sword.

Perspectives
Car-sharing 
company comes 
to campus
j —
Karl Sjogren & Andrea Hamilton
Don’t you wish you had a car 
you could use whenever you 
wanted but didn’t have to worry 
about it the rest of the time?
This year, we’ve spent a lot of 
time looking into car-sharing 
programs, and we finally have a 
winner: Flexcar. Flexcar is a car- 
sharing company that is leading 
the industry and is coming to 
our campus. They offer all the 
same benefits, protections, and 
safeguards as other car-sharing 
programs with the added bonus 
of allowing anyone over 18 years 
old to rent cars. This plan meets 
the needs of college students 
perfectly. Plus, using Flexcar is 
affordable.
What is “car-sharing?”
Flexcar’s car-sharing program 
allows communities to share 
the benefits and costs a similar 
amount so that resources are 
maximized. A variety of vehicles 
may be rented by the hour, by 
the day, or for several days at a 
time. There are locations all over 
the city where the car may be 
dropped off or picked up.
What are the costs?
Flexcar requires a one-time 
membership fee of $35 and costs 
about that amount per year to 
stay an active member. The rate 
for renting a car is between $8 
and $10 an hour. Gas, insurance, 
mileage, on-call assistance, 
maintenance, and professional 
cleaning are all covered.
What are the benefits?
If you can’t afford a car of your 
own, or don’t need one year- 
round, Flexcar means you’ll have 
access to a car whenever you 
need it. Students will no lon­
ger need to worry about leaving 
their cars in Schenley or arrang­
ing to use someone’s driveway. 
Flexcar gives students access to 
affordable vehicles 24 hours a 
day, seven days a week.
FlexCar offers multiple mod­
els from small passenger cars to 
larger SUVs. Flexcar can be used 
by faculty, staff, and groups and 
could eliminate the need for de­
partmental vehicles and make it 
much easier for student groups 
to take trips. It would allow our 
peers greater ability to engage in 
the Pittsburgh community. Car- 
sharing could free up parking 
spaces. It also means fewer cars 
per person, which is great for the 
environment.
We are glad to be able to 
partner with Flexcar and the 
Pittsburgh community to find a 
better way of meeting all of our 
transportation needs.
For further updates on Flexcar, 
and the other results you will see 
from us this semester, visit www.

THE TARTAN • JANUARY 29, 2007
WOMEN’S, from A14
seven straight points before the 
half, bringing them within three 
of Carnegie Mellon, 32-29.
The Tartans fought back after 
the break, but could not keep the 
Spartans from taking the lead 
five minutes into the second half, 
40-38. Carnegie Mellon tied the 
score at 46-46 with 10 minutes 
to play before Aleski sank a 
three-pointer to put the Tartans 
on top for the rest of the game.
Feola led the Tartans with 14 
points and 11 rebounds, mak­
ing Sunday Feola’s third straight
double-double game. First-year 
guard Paige Williamson had 
13 points off the bench, while 
Aleski had 10 points and eight 
rebounds.
“It’s nice to win. We are all 
coming together, we are all play­
ing well, and our young players 
are stepping up, so we are get­
ting some wins,” Feola said. “Our 
defense has been incredible and 
•our offense is finally picking it 
up and playing together.”
The Tartans (8-10, 2-5 UAA) 
will head to the Spartans’ court 
on Friday for a rematch sched­
uled to start at 6 p.m.

“I was surprised at how many 
good freshmen we got,” Lenhart 
said.
“I thought we did pretty well 
from the standpoint of where we 
placed in our different events, 
but not necessarily from the 
standpoint of our performances,” 
said Reggie, who has been on the 
team for three years. “It’s early 
in the season, and the better per­
formances will come though.”
Reggie was optimistic about 
the coming season — UAA rival 
Case offered strong competition
for the Tartans at the meet. “I 
think we’ve got a chance to make 
a big impact at the conference 
meet,” said Reggie. “We’re sick 
of coming in second at the UAA 
meets.” A conference victory 
would hold even more special 
meaning for Reggie, who was on 
the university’s championship 
football team this year as well. 
“There’s nothing that would 
complete my year more than 
another UAA championship in 
another sport,” he said.
The Tartans travel West 
Virginia University this Satur­
day for their next meet.
15 points on five-of-eight shoot­
ing. Kozak contributed 13 points 
and five assists, and O’Rourke 
dished out seven assists in the 
win.
Against Case on Sunday, Mat- 
ta’s layup with 7:59 remaining 
gave the Tartans their biggest 
lead of 11 at 48-37. The Tar­
tans held on the rest of the way, 
despite not making another field 
goal, for the win.
Case went on a 16-4 run, 
taking its first lead of the game 
at 53-52 with 58 seconds 
remaining. On the following 
possession, Einwag drew a foul 
and hit both free throws to let
[over Emory] was huge,” said 
Kozak. “A couple people made 
some huge baskets in regula­
tion, and in overtime to get the 
win... was huge. You want to im­
prove game to game, and there 
were some things we didn’t do 
well [against Case], but one of 
the things we did do well was 
foul shooting, especially in the 
last two minutes. To blow an 11- 
point lead was difficult, but we 
came through again in the clutch 
and we won the game. Two wins 
in the UAA is big.”
The Tartans will take to the 
road to play Case again on Fri­
day at 8 p.m.

SPORTS COMMENTARY
Super Bowl XLI debate: Bears versus Colts
Two football fans make their Super Bowl predictions
No one will argue that Gross­
man has been inconsistent, but 
when he’s been on, he’s been as 
good as anybody. He tied the 
league for second with the most 
passer ratings over 100. Even 
when he had a quarterback 
rating as low as 10.2, his team 
found a way to win that game. 
(Remember the Cardinals’ col­
lapse in October and Denny 
Green’s unforgettable rant?)
Manning had a great game 
against the Patriots in the AFC 
championship, but he hasn’t re­
ally gotten out of a slump. He 
struggled against the Kansas 
City Chiefs during the wildcard 
weekend only to have his de­
fense save him and in the AFC 
divisional playoff against the 
Ravens when all 15 points were 
scored by the ¦ kicker, Adam 
Vinatieri.
Manning can’t win big 
games. He never won a state 
high school championship or 
a college championship, and 
this is only his first Super Bowl 
appearance. Manning has too 
much pressure, too much to 
prove, and he’ll disappoint once 
again.
Collura: Okay, while the 
Colts’ defense wasn’t exactly 
amazing through the regular 
season, they’ve come up big dur­
ing the playoffs, allowing their 
opposing backs an average of 
3.6 yards per carry. This is sig­
nificantly less than the Bears’ 
defense, which has allowed an 
average of 4.4 yards per carry 
this postseason.
While the Colts’ defense is 
still going to need to step up big 
time on Sunday, they’ve been 
heading in the right direction, 
unlike the Bears’ defense, which 
has been on a downslide since 
the end of the regular season.
While Manning may not 
have experience winning “the 
big game,” he is still an All-
Pro quarterback. If Manning 
was going to have any type of 
mental meltdown, it would 
have happened during the AFC 
Championship Game.
For him, that game was the 
big question mark, and his per­
formance, passing for over 300 
yards with a touchdown and 
only one pick, proves he’s finally 
ready for a championship game. 
As for Grossman, he’s gone the 
past two weeks without humili­
ating himself, so he’s due for 
that bad day.
Kim: Never underestimate 
the Bears’ defense. Led by 
Brian Urlacher, the defense 
stopped the Saints’ powerful 
running game. On the flip side, 
the Bears’ underrated running 
back, Thomas Jones, had over 
1200 rushing yards during the 
regular season. He is exactly the 
type of impact player who could 
rip through the Colts’ defense.
In addition, have you heard 
of that new kid on the block, 
Devin Hester? The Colts al­
lowed six kickoff returns for 
220 yards against Ellis Hobbs of 
the New England Patriots in the 
AFC Championship. If Hobbs 
has those stats on kick returns, 
imagine what the All-Pro Hes­
ter will do.
And one more thing: The 
Bears did beat the New Or­
leans Saints’ quarterback, Drew 
Brees, rather easily in the NFC 
Championship. Don’t forget 
that Brees was second in MVP 
voting and an All-Pro quarter­
back. So the Bears will have no 
problem dismantling Manning 
and his crew.
Collura: At this point, the 
Bears’ defense deserves un­
derestimation. After being 
considered one of the most fear­
some defenses in the NFL, they 
slacked off, getting only five 
sacks in their last eight games 
(compared to the 20 they had
in their first eight games), and 
with the exception of Urlacher, 
are playing mediocre at best.
Hobbs wrecked the Colts’ 
special teams, and I guaran­
tee that Colts head coach Tony 
Dungy is spending this week 
fixing that. And while I agree 
that Jones is highly underrated, 
Indianapolis has successfully 
dealt with Larry Johnson, Ja­
mal Lewis, and Corey Dillon, all 
of whom are the same caliber as 
Jones. Jones won’t be a factor. 
While the Colts’ defense and 
special teams maybe somewhat 
questionable, Indianapolis is 
inarguably dominant on the 
rest of the field.
The Colts’ quarterback, run­
ning game, receivers, and 
coaching, not to mention ex­
perience, are going to win this 
game. It’ll be a tight game, but 
I’m going to call it 34-31 Colts, 
with the possibility of another 
huge game-winning kick by 
Vinatieri.
Kim: It is certainly true that 
the Colts have the powerful 
offensive weapons. Almost 
everyone expects the Colts to 
win this Super Bowl easily. 
However, with immense pres­
sure, the Colts are in for a rude 
awakening against the heavy 
underdogs, the Bears.
Grossman and his teammates 
are playing for something more 
than a win — they are playing 
for respect. How many times 
have we seen the underdogs de­
feat the favorites? What about 
the Marlins against the Yan­
kees in the 2003 World Series? 
What about those Florida Ga­
tors against Ohio State in the 
national title game this year?
Manning never beat the 
University of Florida in his col­
legiate years and Grossman is a 
former Gators quarterback. Let 
it be known that I said it first: 
Da Bears will win 33-27.
Swimmers make their final preparations before UAAs
“We came through again in the 
clutch and we won the game.”

to force overtime. Down by one 
with six seconds left, O’Rourke 
drove the lane and drew a foul, 
sending him to the line for two 
shots. After missing his first, 
O’Rourke hit the second, knot­
ting the game at 65-65. After a 
timeout, Emory brought the ball 
up the court, but tight defense 
by the Tartans kept the Eagles 
from attempting a shot.
The Tartans relied on a bal­
anced attack, with senior guard 
Brad Matta leading the way 
with 16 points and 12 rebounds, 
marking his first career double­
double. Sophomore forward 
Ryan Einwag added 15 points 
and seven rebounds, and Ander­
son finished with a career-high
Carnegie Mellon retake the lead 
with 37 seconds left.
Case then turned the ball over 
and was forced to foul again. 
Sophomore forward Jon Wolle- 
ben made both his foul shots to 
give the Tartans a three-point 
lead with 22 seconds left. Case 
missed another shot, and the 
Tartans sealed the deal with two 
more free throws, making them 
12-13 from the free-throw line 
in the second half.
Against Case, Einwag led the 
Tartans with 16 points and six 
rebounds, and sophomore center 
Rob Pearson added a career-high 
13 points. Kozak led the team 
with six assists to complement 
his six points.

Collura: If I were going 
to make a Super Bowl XLI 
prediction, I would bet on the 
Indianapolis Colts all the way. 
Why, you ask? Well, for three 
main reasons: Peyton Manning 
has managed to get out of his 
playoff slump, rookie Joseph 
Addai has amped up the Colts’ 
running game, and the Colts’ 
defense has finally shown up.
The Chicago Bears? They only 
have Rex Grossman, who is, at 
best, an “average quarterback.” 
Then there are the Sundays 
where Grossman throws more 
picks than actual completions. 
He just won’t cut it in the Super 
Bowl.
Kim: The Colts may have 
reached the Super Bowl, but 
the Chicago Bears will win it all 
in the end. The Colts’ defense 
has finally shown up? Are you 
kidding me? The Colts had the 
worst rushing defense in the 
entire NFL. A couple of good 
games certainly does not erase 
the fact that they had a horrific 
rush defense.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team pulled off a 
weekend sweep by defeating 
conference foes Emory Univer­
sity and Case Western Reserve 
University.
On Friday, the Tartans won 
a thrilling game over Emory, 
winning 71-70 in overtime. On 
Sunday, the Tartans used strong 
free-throw shooting down the 
stretch to prevail 58-53 over 
Case.
On Friday, the Tartans trailed 
Emory 70-66 with 1:23 remain­
ing in overtime before they 
scored the final five points.
At the 1:07 mark of overtime, 
junior guard Geoff Kozak passed 
the ball to first-year guard Jack 
Anderson, who was able to lay 
the ball in and draw the foul. An­
derson hit the foul shot to cut the 
lead to one. The Tartans’ defense
stepped up big, forcing a shot 
clock violation by the Eagles. 
Then Kozak arguably hit the big­
gest basket of his career with 16 
seconds left, laying the ball in to 
give Carnegie Mellon the 71-70 
lead.
“In situations like that, you 
need to want the ball when the 
pressure’s the greatest,” said Ko­
zak. “I got the ball at the top of 
the key and people were moving 
around and it was my opportu­
nity to make a play.”
With two seconds left, Emo­
ry’s Adrian Sosa pulled up and 
attempted a three-pointer only 
to have sophomore guard Corey 
O’Rourke’s hand block the shot. 
Sosa got the ball back but was 
unable to get a shot off before 
the buzzer sounded, giving the 
Tartans the thrilling one-point 
win.

The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team outshot two 
University Athletic Associa­
tion (UAA) opponents at home 
this weekend to decisively end 
a three-game losing streak. Af­
ter defeating Emory University 
77-66 on Friday evening, the 
Tartans went on to demolish 
Case Western Reserve University 
70-58 on Sunday afternoon.
On Friday, the Tartans domi­
nated the Emory Eagles in their 
first UAA win of the season. 
Carnegie Mellon led the entire 
game, overtaking Emory by 11 
points for a 77-66 finish.
Sophomore point guard Stacie 
Aleski set the stage for the Tar­
tans with a three-pointer in the 
second minute of play. The Tar­
tans built up their lead to 8-0 
before Beth Bergmann sank a 
three-point shot for Emory to 
bring the score to 8-3 with 15 
minutes left in the first half.
A layup by sophomore forward 
Jeanette Schilling brought the 
Tartan lead to 18 points (33-15) 
with two minutes remaining in 
the first half. The Eagles, lead by 
sophomore Erica Kaplan, went 
on a streak, scoring eight points 
to bring the score to 33-23 be­
fore the break.
Emory started the second half 
strong, cutting the Tartan lead 
to three points (46-43) with 13 
minutes left in the game. Less 
than a minute later, Bergmann 
took advantage of a Carnegie 
Mellon turnover to tie the game 
at 46-46. After exchanging 
turnovers, junior guard Leah 
Feola sank a layup to place the 
Tartans back on top. Carnegie 
Mellon maintained its lead for 
the rest of the game.
Sophomore forward Ashley 
Rothwell and first-year guard 
Paige Williamson led the Tartan 
scoring with 15 points apiece. 
Aleski and Feola followed 
closely with 14 and 13 points, 
respectively. Sophomore guard 
Colleen Light added 10 points to 
the Tartan total. Feola grabbed 
13 rebounds throughout the 
game.
“The first couple [UAA] games 
have been tough because we 
played the top teams,” Feola 
said. “It was really good to get 
these wins. It really boosted our 
confidence.”
The Tartans opened strong

“I was really impressed with all the girls,” 
senior co-captain Lucy Fortin said. “Our 
coach told us it was going to be a really close 
meet and that we really needed to get up and 
race right from the start. Right off the bat, we 
won the first relay and just kept it up from

200-yard freestyle relay team of Retotar, 
Andrews, Connell, and Sieger closed the 
women’s meet with a win (1:40.22).
“We had a lot of girls getting season-best 
times, which is great at this point in the sea­
son, with just 11 days till our conference 
meet,” Fortin said. “It was also the seniors’ 
last dual meet, so it meant a lot to us to win 
[on Saturday].”
For the men, the 200-yard medley relay 
team of sophomore Ryan Piper, first-year

ski, and sophomore Ron Papa took an early 
win with a time of 1:37.77.

Carnegie Mellon’s track and 
field teams competed in the Spar­
tan Invitational at Case Western 
Reserve University on Satur­
day. The men’s team took home 
a third-place finish, while the 
women ended the day in seventh.
The invitational started with 
the women’s high jump, which 
saw sophomore Jessica Meng 
grab fourth place with a 1.47-me­
ter jump. Later, in the men’s long 
jump, sophomore Eric Tang also 
placed fourth after jumping 6.05 
meters.
First-year James Hulley threw 
for 13.67 meters in the men’s shot 
put to secure a fourth place fin­
ish. Junior Michael Reggie edged 
out the competition in the men’s 
weight throw, throwing 14.44 
meters to win first place by a 
0.35-meter margin.
The men’s triple jump saw two 
Tartans in the top three; Tang 
and fellow sophomore Joel Palko 
came in second and third at 12.89 
meters and 12.82 meters, respec­
tively. For the women, Meng 
came in fourth with a 10.28-me­
ter jump. First-year Anna Lenhart 
vaulted 2.44 meters in the wom­
en’s pole vault event, and came in 
second.
“I think it’s a pretty good start 
to the season,” Lenhart said. The 
invitational was her second meet 
as a member of the team, but the 
first with such a wide array of 
competitors.
, Senior Nicholas Bannister 
won the men’s 55-meter hurdles 
event, finishing in 7.88 seconds. 
Junior Drew Miller placed third 
in the men’s one-mile run, finish­
ing with a time of 4:31.29.
The men’s 4x200-meter relay 
‘A’ team came in third as well, 
finishing in 1:34.22, only 77 hun­
dredths of a second out of second 
place.
The longer runs and the dash 
events were not as successful for 
the Tartans, but the men’s and 
women’s A’ teams both came in 
third in their respective 4x400- 
meter relays to close out the day. 
The women finished in 4:21.53, 
and the men finished with a time 
of 3:33.95.
The Spartan Invitational 
turned out to be a great chance 
for the younger members of the 
team to get experience at a large 
meet — many of the top finishers 
yj^re sophomores and first-years.

The Carnegie Mellon track and 
fie&J team’s season began with 
the new semester. The team had 
its first competition Janurary
20 at Denison University, where 
the women’s team won 11 of the 
meet’s events. Two of these wins 
came from sophomore jumper 
Jessica Meng.
Last week, Meng sat down 
with The Tartan to discuss her 
early success and the track sea­
son to come.
Tartan: When did you first 
get involved with track?
Meng: I started in middle 
school, probably seventh grade. 
Everyone originally made fun 
of me for it because I absolutely 
hate running.
T: Is that why you became a 
jumper?
M: Yeah, pretty much. Not 
only do I hate running, I am 
really bad at it. Seriously, every 
team I have ever been on, I’m 
pretty much the slowest runner 
on the team. But I’ve always just 
been a really botfncy person, so I 
tried jumping. I pretty much just 
stick with that.
I do long, triple, and high 
jump. I used to do hurdles and 
am trying to get back into that. 
Triple jump is definitely my fa­
vorite; high jump, it’s just a lot
easier if you’re taller; and then 
long jump you’re supposed to 
run really fast, which I can’t do, 
so I get frustrated.
T: How exactly does indoor/ 
outdoor track work?
M: Well, it’s the same team 
and coaches; we just start com­
peting now in January, inside 
obviously. We have UAA [cham­
pionships] and everything and 
then start all over again out­
side.
It’s kind of hard around here, 
because there really aren’t any 
indoor tracks around. So for 
now, we walk to Duquesne and 
Pitt to practice a few days a 
week. Then other than that, we 
jump around Skibo while the 
basketball team stares at us like 
we’re crazy!
T: Do you have a preference 
between indoor and outdoor?
M: I never ran indoor track 
before coming to college, so it’s 
still a little new and weird to 
me. I think I like outdoor better. 
Inside’s nice, because it’s always 
warm and you’re never stuck 
running in the rain or anything, 
but sometimes it’s really hot,
and I almost feel claustropho­
bic.
T: Was track part of your 
decision to come to Carnegie 
Mellon?
M: I think it was. I was on the 
dance team too, and I knew I ei­
ther wanted to dance or do track 
in college, so that was part of it. 
Then I came here on A recruiting 
trip and it was a lot of fun, so I’m 
glad I’m here.
T: How do you balance your 
time with track and school?
M: I like to stay really busy, I 
think it makes me work harder. 
On top of track, I’m an attendant 
at the pod games, do Dancer’s 
Symposium, am in a sorority, 
and I teach a dance class for 
iFS.
T: Wow, you are really busy. 
You guys get to have little breaks 
and travel for track quite a bit 
—any favorite places?
M: Not really. We travel often, 
but we don’t really go far; nor­
mally it’s somewhere in Ohio. 
It’s sad though, we always travel 
the week of Carnival, so I'll 
pretty much never get to go!

Take it upstairs
brillobox: the bar with a brainEverything you need to know
On family matters
Thursdays at brillobox are more or less like 
Thursdays at any other bar in Pittsburgh. Rowdy 
20-somethings meet up after a long day at work or 
in class and revel in their own drunkenness. It's a 
familiar scene — until you go up the stairs, that is.
Above the bar is a large, multipurpose performance 
space. It could be a dance floor, a meeting room, a 
concert venue, a comedy lounge... or just more bar. 
“As soon as I saw'the second floor I knew this was 
the place," said the bar’s owner, Eric Stern. Stern, 
along with his wife Renee Ickes, opened brillobox in 
September 2005 after returning to the city that Stern 
grew up in; the city "reinvented itself," said Stern, in 
the 15 years he was away.
“We weren’t interested in opening a typical bar,” 
Stern said. He and his wife wanted to create 
a cultural space that would give the artistic 
community in Pittsburgh — a community Stern said 
“pulsates with energy” — something special. Even 
the first floor of the Penn Avenue building, which 
Stern guesses is over 100 years old, is replete with 
details that differentiate it from most other bars in 
the area. Holding flat-screen TVs showing sports' 
games and high-definition movies, the walls are 
filled with artwork that Stern tries to rotate and vary 
on a semi-regular basis. He considers himself almost 
more of a curator than the owner of a bar.
Of course, the real magic of brillobox is upstairs. The 
entire second floor of the bar is one large room, with 
a low stage at one end and a fully-stocked bar at the 
other. The space in between can be anything — in 
the past week alone it was a dance floor emceed by 
a local DJ, a meeting space for a group of eccentric 
nerds, a studio for a sketching session, and a venue 
for two bands. Featuring a crystal chandelier on one 
end and tiny golden Buddha statues on the bar at 
the other, its flexibility is evident even at first glance.
This past Thursday, the second floor was filled with 
chairs, lit with candles, and populated by area nerds 
looking to hear a good presentation. Thursday night 
was the monthly meeting of Dorkbot, a national 
organization of “people doing strange things with 
electricity," as the group's motto so aptly puts it.
January's meeting, this past Thursday, saw a 
presentation by Carnegie Mellon professor Roger 
Dannenberg, who has gained recognition for 
working with computerized musical instruments, 
including the construction of the
robotic bagpiper McBlare.. Thursday night at 
brillobox, Dannenberg presented a foot pedal he 
designed to allow a computerized instrument to 
keep tempo with a live band.
With the lights down, there was an air of 
professionalism in the room. Dannenberg’s laptop 
glowed on a podium as he glanced at the screen, 
projected on the wall behind him. As his talk 
continued, however, it was clear that this was a 
community of people doing something they love 
for that reason only. “I’ve never done this before, 
since I just got this working this afternoon," said 
Dannenberg as he prepared to test out the pedal. It 
worked, and the audience gave Dannenberg a round 
of applause.
It didn't feel like a bar, and that is exactly what 
Stern is hoping to achieve — in his words, to 
“make a positiye contribution somehow." Situated 
on Penn Avenue, the border between Bloomfield 
and Lawrenceville, brillobox is right in the center 
of Pittsburgh's ongoing cultural renaissance. Stern 
spent time in New York before moving back and 
feels that the cultural districts feel just like parts of 
Brooklyn, but without the hustle of a big city.
Dissatisfied with the cost of living in New York,
Stern and Ickes moved back to Pittsburgh to start 
their family. “You've got to kill yourself just to 
survive, basically," said Stern. He feels that many 
other people may begin to come to the same 
realization, and that influx of younger adults could 
do great things to revitalize the city. “If there was 
just a certain watershed amount of people... it would 
just explode.”
Stern and Ickes are doing their part to add to the 
area's cultural ambiance. "The timing has been so 
fortuitously perfect,” said Stern. And he continues 
adding new events to the bar’s schedule to draw in 
a more varied demographic. One of their mainstay 
events, besides Dorkbot meetings, is something 
called “Drink and Draw," a free studio session every 
other Tuesday that lets patrons come in and try their 
hand at sketching live models.
As the Dorkbot meeting drew to a close, the next 
act came in to set up its equipment. The DJ, Big 
Throwback, brought his equipment onstage as an 
episode of the cartoon show Thundercats played 
on the projector and the members of Dorkbot began 
to disperse. The founders were discussing next 
month’s lineup of speakers. There was talk of a 
schizophrenia simulator, and someone assured the 
small cluster of people that it would certainly be 
making an appearance.
Just another night at the bar.

Dear Janet,
It’s horrible, but I don’t particularly 
like my sister. She wants to be 
a doctor and I “just” want to get 
married and have kids, and my 
parents have always been prouder 
of her. I am getting married this 
summer, and my parents are 
planning to make me ask her to 
be my maid of honor. I REALLY 
don’t want to, because I honestly 
don’t like her very much. What 
can I do?
— Marrying Really Soon 
Dear MRS,
Are your parents paying for the 
wedding? If so, as much as you 
may hate it,- they have some say 
over things. Even if you don’t like 
her, there's no reason not to have 
your sister as a bridesmaid — see 
if you can sell your parents on that. 
If they’re determined not to budge, 
tell them that you’re planning on 
having two maids of honor. That 
could be a way to still have your 
best friend as your maid of honor 
but placate your parents.
However, if you’re paying for the 
wedding, well, it’s your show! 
Unless you think it will cause a 
major rift between you and your 
parents, just tell them that your 
sister is going to be honored as a 
bridesmaid.
Either way, I hope that you try to 
spend some time alone with your 
sister before the wedding. We 
all tend to have these ideas of 
who our siblings are, but people
change. Find out if it’s just your 
jealousy that’s keeping you from 
connecting with her or if you just 
really don’t enjoy her company.
— Janet 
Dear Janet,
I love my boyfriend... the problem 
is his family. Every time I go to 
dinner with them, they say really 
offensive and ignorant things.... 
I’ve been trying to bite my tongue 
and not argue with them when 
they say things that are false or 
offend me, but I come home from 
these dinners with the inside of my 
cheek raw! What should I do?
— Lefty Enduring Family Troubles 
Dear LEFT,
One curious omission in your 
letter was your boyfriend: What’s 
his role in this? I don’t know 
his beliefs or the nature of your 
relationship, but it’s important 
that you find out what he feels 
about the things his family says.
Because, in all honesty, if anyone 
should challenge his family, it 
should be your boy. Everything 
really depends on his family: You 
might be able to politely disagree 
with them or, on the other side of 
the spectrum, you might just have 
to make your dinner dates a little 
less frequent.
— Janet

Expect to see Chimaira's 
Resurrection in stores 
starting March 6. The album 
title may be a misnomer, 
however, as Chimaira's 
tracks are expected to be 
better than ever before.
Big Al’s Metal Shop
Hold your breath for the next six Tuesdays...
It seems that March 6 will bring us the much-awaited, much- 
leaked, much-debated, and perhaps over-hyped release of 
Chinese Democracy. For a while, it seemed the real thing (i.e., 
democracy in China) had a better chance of happening before 
we got the album, but Axl promises that this is, tentatively, 
the real thing. Unless of course... Nah, forget it. It's coming, 
and if you’ve seen the band live or watched the concert 
videos on YouTube, then it should come as no surprise that 
this is worth talking about. Songs like “Better," "The Blues," 
and "There Was A Time” (awesome acronym) all push the 
envelope of hard rock, building a bridge linking the present to 
the ’90s. With a musical sense that evokes Stevie Wonder and 
Queen battling a feral Zeppelin, these three songs alone prove 
that the man still has it. If only we could get our grubby paws 
on it...
Speaking of March 6, it’s on that day that another band is due 
to release an album that will hopefully revitalize its career. 
Resurrection, from Cleveland's Chimaira, marks the band's 
first album since departing from Roadrunner Records, and it 
finds the band embracing the core elements of its sound. Of 
course, there is thrash and yes, there's the industrial “clang," 
but like Fear Factory at their peak in the mid '90s, the result 
sounds wholly natural. There are no singles on Resunection; 
it is not a comeback. Rather, it is a band whose members 
have benefited from a steady evolution of albums, allowing 
them to stretch their legs and settle into a solid unit. If you’ve 
heard the band before, then most likely you've heard the 
anthem "Power Trip." Perhaps you even saw Chimaira’s gritty 
documentary, The Dehumanizing Process, which tells the 
story of the band’s slow decay and hopeful rebirth.
Still, I would argue that this latest is not a resurrection but 
an awakening. This is evidenced by epics like “Six," which 
begins with simple acoustic guitars and bent-notes evoking 
Arabic sensibilities — winding into a twistedly simple solo
— only to later blend effortlessly into hardcore. Not chugga-
chugga like Hatebreed (who I also love), but rather the 
deliberately slow pace of a band with nothing left to prove. 
Piano and orchestration weave into the song and dissipate, 
leaving the listener with a sense of satisfaction that Chimaira 
has indeed found a formula that should serve the band for 
years to come. The rest of the album is diverse, but if I was to 
nominate a coherent theme throughout, it would be the battle 
between foreground and background. Not to be mistaken 
with the common tool of light and shade, "The Flame” is 
another, albeit disturbing, example of that dynamic. Starting 
off with the tortured screams of a woman about to be struck 
with a blunt object, the horror we feel is mostly transmuted 
into rage, but not forgotten. Rather, it lingers there. A polished 
effort from a band that has established itself as worthy of 
being in the same league as Machine Head and Testament
— as American heavyweights.
Finally, another heavyweight makes a significant return of 
sorts. While New Orleans is primarily regarded in this country 
as the home of jazz, the city has hosted a thriving metal scene 
for the past two decades. Corrosion of Conformity, Down, and 
Exhorder are just a few of the bands that combine Southern 
sensibilities with punk to form a sludge that works oh so 
well. Exhorder is even credited by some pundits as being the 
true originator of the power metal groove that is commonly 
associated with Pantera and White Zombie. For one thing, 
lead singer Kyle Thomas did his part to expand the range 
of metal vocals and is not given the attention he deserves 
among the general public.
After Exhorder disbanded, Thomas went on to front various 
bands and has now landed with Alabama Thunderpussy. 
Though I can honestly say that I was never really into 
the band before, it's clear Monsieur Thomas has brought 
something extra to the table. Perhaps a throwback to the early 
’80s new wave of British heavy metal, the structure is classic 
metal with precise guitar work. What’s interesting is the way
Image courtesy of Roadrunner Records
that Thomas contrasts with this change in style — imagine 
Phil Anselmo as the frontman for Iron Maiden. It’s a curious 
mix, and I must say that this apparent disconnect between 
vocal and musical styles is what has kept this album in my 
car for the past couple of weeks. It’s one of those types that 
may turn some off the band, but I’d say it’s one of the most 
interesting albums of this young semester.
Before I go, a big thank you to last year's Pillbox staff, 
especially to our editor Kristen, whom I unceremoniously 
forgot to thank after thanking a list of publicists and label 
people in my year-end column. Obrigado!

Students are cooler than you think Paperhouse
Weekly hip-hop classes offer style and confidence liataAlDlHow to listen to musica radio station
“Hey, what is this guy going to tell me that I don’t already know?”
Okay, on some level, I’m riot going to tell you anything — it’s just a 
reminder. I find that some of my friends don’t know how to sit down 
and appreciate music, and then they get confused when they don’t 
enjoy it nearly as much as I do.
I’m kind of done with the article now. Sit down and enjoy it. Good 
music is usually good because it rewards intense concentration and 
repeated scrutiny by getting better.
Musician and theorist Brian Eno once said, "Ambient music must 
be able to accommodate many levels of listening attention without 
enforcing one in particular; it must be as ignorable as it is interesting.” 
Note that he made that a defining characteristic of ambient music, 
implying that it shouldn't hold for other types. That means that the 
majority of music is not designed to be ignored. Really fantastic music 
may grab you if you just have it on while surfing the internet, but 
equally amazing music may be unassuming and you’ll miss it. This, I 
think, is what happens to my friends.
Music can be roughly divided into two types, with some overlap: 
There’s music for sitting and music for dancing. So, the first time you 
get a new album, figure out which type it is, and use it for that. If you 
can’t figure it out, sit and listen — good dance music will force you to 
get up and dance, mostly. Good music for sitting will just make you 
hate it if you try to dance.
Don’t lie down, you'll fall asleep. Sit in an armchair, lean back, and 
close your eyes. Invest in a good pair of headphones — they’ll give 
you more sound quality per dollar than speakers, and have aspects all 
but the best speakers cannot duplicate (hello killer stereo separation).
The last important part of listening is your mood. I like listening to 
music that complements my mood and doesn’t try to force me into a 
mood I don’t have. For example: Don’t listen to Coil if you’re feeling 
happy - it’ll sound dumb, listen to it late at night and get scared. For 
example, I’m listening to some funk from ’70s Bollywood action films 
right now and becoming much more energized about this column than
I would’ve been otherwise. But be careful of this, too; I was vaguely 
upset last week and listened to Stars of the Lid (example song title: 
“Lonely People (Are Getting Lonelier)”), which resulted in a little bit of a 
six-hour, what’s-wrong-with-my-life depression.
It’s not hard: sit down, pay attention, and match the music to your 
mood. You’ll enjoy music more.

Gliding, hitting, waving, popping. Sound familiar?
These fresh techniques, in addition to general hip-hop 
education, are offered weekly in the UC Aerobics Room 
by international FreeStylers (iFS).
iFS, formed in 2002, aims to share its unlikely passion 
for all types of dance, especially hip-hop, with Carnegie 
Mellon students. Striving for diversity, the group 
rejects the audition process and maintains a free and 
recreational status.
“[We] hope to show that our creativity can be developed 
and expressed through dance,” said Frank Denbow, co­
president of iFS and a senior in the School of Computer 
Science’ With these classes, he hopes students gain 
respect and understanding for the various styles of hip - 
hop. “Students should ... have a basic understanding 
about dance musicality, expressive movement, and 
confidence within and outside of dance,” Denbow said.
The session trumped my expectations. A surprising 
assortment of students — breakers, beginners, and 
more — chattered and stretched while waiting for 
the class to begin. Denbow made it clear that this 
class is open to anyone. "Don’t worry if you haven’t 
danced before,” he tells his class before the hip-hop 
extravaganza begins. Justin Timberlake blares as 
Denbow reviews basic hip hop moves and demonstrates 
new techniques. During the class, Denbow introduced 
concepts like musicality — understanding the varying 
beats and rhythms you can dance to in a song. And . 
somehow, among the awkward, there was shining effort
— and a genuine appreciation for hip-hop.
Michael Menchaca | Art Staff
“To the college campus, [hip-hop] is a method of 
expression, a way for students to learn and gain insight 
into their own creativity, talent, and abilities," Denbow 
said.
More than that, it’s a cultural movement attempting to 
create social innovations. iFS does its part to prevent 
some of the socially awkward situations at Carnegie 
Mellon by bringing a diverse group of people together 
under the premise of learning hip-hop. Denbow, a 
limitless dancer of many hip-hop styles, leads the class 
with patience and thought.
After almost an hour of choreography and teaching, 
Denbow broke the class into three or four freestyle 
circles, each lead by some of Carnegie Mellon’s most 
popular breakers. More bass thumped from the speakers 
and people took turns showing off their moves. Each 
admires and pays tribute to the hip hop culture in their 
own way. Denbow walked around checking everyone 
out as the hip-hop movement continued.
... And all I learned was boom, boom, hit hit up!

Right: Visitors stand next to Alistair Wilson's

Ian Charlesworth (on the wall).

Global ties at RGM Gallery
New exhibit offers art from Northern Ireland
Olga Strachna | Photo Staff
War, politics, and lily pads — Tides, the newest exhibit in 
the Regina Gouger Miller Gallery, has got it all. Consisting 
exclusively of artists from Northern Ireland, Tides is a bold 
concoction of mediums, messages, and some other "m” 
words.
As art continues to be a foil for society, Tides is an attempt 
to find sanity in the midst of Ireland’s current unsteady 
state. "There’s a feeling of tentative optimism," said Dean 
of the School of Art John Carson. “The residue of political 
trouble is still there.”
The Miller Gallery uses this amalgamation of styles to 
its benefit. Mary McIntyre’s scenic photographs of both 
modern architecture and plush countryside line the 
entryway. Mesmerized by the rich greens next to hard gray 
steel in McIntyre's pictures, visitors may nearly trip over 
Alistair Wilson's "Giverny n,” an installation of Water lily 
disks (a la Claude Monet) on the floor of the gallery. Just 
down the hall is Ian Charlesworth's "Always, Again." Made 
from carbon on plexiglass, "Always, Again" is a monster, 
in-your-face piece with an energy similar to Jackson 
Pollock’s work.
The sentiment shows through in the art itself. In Michael 
Hogg’s “Pivot," a stack of political posters is barely held 
in place by a stepladder and clamp; it's held down for the 
moment, but any subtle bump or shove could tip it right 
back over.
Next to "Pivot” sit several cardboard models of buildings in 
Northern Ireland created by Aisling O'Brien. Perhaps the 
most interesting of these is an oval structure once used 
as barracks for the army, now converted into a football 
stadium. It's a sign of what Carson called “reflection,” but 
also of looking forward.
“Art is educational," Carson said. “It gives you insight 
into what is going on in the world, but also helps us 
introspect on our own society," he added. “[Some pieces] 
have local references to what's going on in Ireland, but 
have underlying global themes." Satisfied with the exhibit, 
Carson said, “It's an interesting time to get art from that 
part of the world."
Matt Siffert | Assistant Pillbox Editor
Olga Strachna | Photo Staff
The gallery's top floor is equally impressive in message, 
as well as in diversity of formats. "People are less precious 
about mediums in art today," Carson said of this mixture.
It comes as no surprise that Carnegie Mellon, a school that 
teaches its art students everything from sculpting to video, 
hosted a show with this breadth of talent. “If you want to 
be at the cutting edge," said Carson, "you have to be able 
to use these mediums to your advantage.”

Crawling with
Gallery-hopping Pittsburghers
Last Friday night, local artists and musicians turned 
downtown Pittsburgh into one enormous gallery. The 
Pittsburgh Cultural Trust's Gallery Crawl performs this 
transformation four times a year, leaving every gallery in the 
Cultural District open late and packing each venue with art, 
music, people, and spinach dip.
The first Gallery Crawl was held in March 2004, according 
to a report the Heinz School prepared for the Cultural Trust. 
Only four galleries participated in the first crawl, but last 
Friday’s event included 15 venues and attracted thousands 
of spectators. Kathryn Heidemann, a 2004 graduate of the 
Heinz School and manager of the Cultural Trust’s education 
and community outreach program, explained that the trust’s 
goal is to rejuvenate the downtown arts scene by drawing in 
repeat customers with free events like the Crawl.
Pittsburghers were certainly drawn in last Friday, braving 
the snow to mob the galleries downtown. The trek began 
at CAPA, the Pittsburgh High School for the Creative and 
Performing Arts. The downstairs gallery featured a photo 
essay by Lynn Johnson on the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr. 
by three white supremacists. The upstairs gallery showcased 
students' responses to Johnson’s exhibit. Johnson said that 
she once lost faith in the power of photography to change 
lives when her show was rejected as too severe. “I’m a 
believer again,” she said, “because I've watched people watch 
this work.”
Around the corner at the Northside Urban Pathways Charter 
High School, a predominantly African-American steel pan 
band blew away a multicolored audience. It seemed a more 
hopeful view of tolerance and diversity than the CAPA show.
Down the street at the Trombino Piano Gallerie, artist Robert 
Johnston explained his method of stereo realism while the
Art
brave the cold
gallery’s owner played a green piano with yellow and orange 
keys designed by artist Dale Chihuly. Stereo realism stacks 
two images on top of each other, showing what we see when 
we’re not focusing on something. Johnston, who studied art 
in France and Italy, explained that the technique is a reaction 
to the study of realism which art students must follow. One 
pencil drawing of a homeless man, framed with fragments of 
cardboard boxes, was particularly arresting; he seemed out of 
focus, as if someone was glancing at him while walking by.
Immediately upon entering SPACE'S Home/Away exhibit, 
it was obvious this was where all the cool kids were. Home/ 
Away was a psychedelic rave: The centerpiece was a teepee 
painted with rainbows filled with a howling drum circle. In 
one corner, Christmas lights spelled out “Just Good Vibes." In 
another, a film of an LP of Indian music rotated endlessly.
Featuring collaborative installation works by seven artists, 
Future Tenant was also hopping. Jesse Rye, co-director of the 
gallery, was impressed by the caliber of the crowd. "Usually 
they just come for the free beer,” he said, “but this time 
they’re here for the beer and the art.”
If the success of the Gallery Crawl program is any indication, 
the art scene in Pittsburgh is going nowhere but up.
Gallery owners and artists hope that the event will whet 
Pittsburghers’ appetite for art, bringing them back as regular 
visitors. As Johnston said, "You have to crawl before you can 
walk.”
The next Gallery Crawl will be held April 20.

Avoiding the sophomore slump
Can follow-up albums live up to killer debuts?
It’s the end of 2004. You’re at a party, bumpin’ to “Drop it 
Like it’s-Hot,” clicking your tongue to the beat, when a friend 
tells you about the absolute best concert he went to the other 
night: a new Canadian band with strings and horns and crazy 
dudes railing on each other with drumsticks. He burns you 
their album, Funeral, you give it a listen, and — move over 
Franz Ferdinand! — Arcade Fire is your new favorite band 
forever and always. Fast-forward some months later when 
your friend tells you of a new underground sensation. Eager to 
be on the ball with this new wonderful indie genre 
you’ve found, you beg him to get you a copy. And 
now, Clap Your Hands Say Yeah, with its charmingly 
cracked voices and catchy melodies, scoots on up to 
your podium of rock.
Now it’s early 2007 and you read that both of your 
beloved bands are releasing follow-up albums this 
year. Unable to contain your excitement, you jump 
up and scream, “Finally!” But in the middle of your 
celebratory dance, a despicable idea enters your 
mind: With such monumental debuts to live up 
to, what if the new releases fail to meet your high 
expectations? No way! Perish the thought... or 
maybe not.
It is a sad fact that many bands suffer a sophomore 
slump after a highly acclaimed first album. Pressure 
from fans to produce another terrific album can easily lead to a 
band's collapse. A band may stick to the formula that led it to 
success and end with a pale imitation of its past. Conversely, 
a band could choose to head toward a different style in order 
to find new exciting sounds, which could turn sour when fans 
no longer relate to the music. Of course, the best solution 
to all this is to keep on truckin’ with their good vibes and 
blow off everyone’s faces again with an even more exciting, 
surprising, and solid album than its predecessor..Simple, 
right?
Considering the widespread praise of Arcade Fire, it may be 
rather difficult to top the group's groundbreaking opus that is 
Funeral. From the first soft-spoken line of "Neighborhood #1 
(Tunnels)" to the symphonic climax of "In the Backseat,” the 
album is a nonstop powerhouse filled with nostalgia, desire, 
and beauty. The band gained a following quickly due to rave 
reviews on independent media sites and music blogs, along 
with kind words from David Bowie and David Byrne. On 
stage, the band takes its music to grandiose heights, with at 
least six members per show (often many more) clad in suits, 
delivering their souls through guitars, organs, accordion, 
violins, and an array of percussive objects, all the while 
singing and chanting and yelling their invigorating lyrics.
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah also came to fame through word 
of mouth on the Internet. The band released its self-titled 
debut independently, charming listeners with a smooth brand 
of simple, calm rock (save for its circus-inspired opener).
The group’s unique style of singing, with a cracked and 
wavering voice that often reaches the point of whining, over 
softly driven rhythms and fuzzy synths meshes to produce an 
undeniably fun and catchy sound. The album has sold about 
200,000 copies without formal promotion, and the group has 
been touring almost nonstop since its release.
Now each of these bands has a chance to solidify its image 
as one of today's best acts in music. Their new albums could

a highly acclaimed first album. 
Pressure from fans to produce

prove that their debuts weren’t just a fluke that caught the 
public’s attention at just the right time. If their new albums 
are as exciting and successful as their firsts, Clap Your Hands 
Say Yeah and Arcade Fire may follow in the footsteps of such 
sustaining artists as Nirvana, Bob Dylan, Radiohead, and Led 
Zeppelin.
There's nothing like two consecutive hit albums to kick 
off a successful music career, and few bands demonstrate 
this better than rock legend Led Zeppelin. The group’s first 
album, Led Zeppelin, won a large devoted fan base with its 
innovative blend of blues and folk carried by loud distorted 
guitars, unrelenting drums, and Robert Plant's godly pipes.
Less than a year later, the group did the unthinkable and 
produced a new album that blew even its own debut out of 
the water. Led Zeppelin Ushot to number one on the U.S. 
and UK charts, and with good reason. Starting with the 
now-legendary "Whole Lotta Love,” the band developed 
its sound with soft/hard alternating songs like "Ramble 
On,” straightforward tracks like “Living Loving Maid,” and 
solo-packed jams like "Moby Dick.” Led Zeppelin IIsecured 
Zeppelin's status as one of the most influential acts of its era, 
and paved the way for the group to become and remain one of 
the most popular and influential rock bands of all time.
It has been about two years since Arcade Fire and Clap Your 
Hands Say Yeah released their debut albums, giving them 
more time to flesh out ideas for new songs than was the case
for Led Zeppelin II. With a longer period between albums, 
a band has time to rethink its style and musical direction, 
which could lead to another (differently) innovative album.
When artists drift away from their original styles rather than 
building on them, they take a huge risk. Sometimes it pays 
off, as it did with Weezer’s Pinkerton, which first alienated 
fans with its turn from the catchy melodies and innocent 
lyrics of its self-titled predecessor. But once listeners dug 
through its screeching guitars and feedback, they 
found the album to be a sullen masterpiece. On the 
. other hand, a turn in style could lead the artist right 
into a brick wall. Mos Def’s dive into the abyss of rap- 
rock on The New Danger marked the beginning of 
the end for his music career.
Clap Your Hands Say Yeah has already released its 
new album Some Loud Thunder in its entirety for 
streaming on the group's MySpace page (it's since 
been taken down, save a couple of songs), revealing 
a new, drearier sound. “Love Song No. 7," one of the 
first leaked tracks, displays a dissonant mood and rise 
in complexity of song structure. This turn is already 
receiving praise from music blogs, but the question 
still remains whether it will impress Clap Your Hands 
Say Yeah’s bigger fans.
The members of Arcade Fire seem to have bought into 
their own hype, as they have surrounded their new album 
Neon Bible with many quirky previews. The first single, 
“Intervention," was first released only through a toll-free phone 
line, and the track listing was revealed in a melodramatic 
YouTube clip: What less would you expect from a band whose 
debut was titled Funeral? "Intervention" shows the band 
retaining its lush sound and bittersweet themes, but other 
leaked tracks hint at more experimentation.
Though both albums will probably leak in full before their 
release, moral listeners can pick up Some Loud Thunder 
tomorrow and Neon Bible March 5.

More than just paintings on the wall
The Frame strives to include students outside of CFA
Oscar Wilde once said “Art is the most intense mode of 
individualism that the world has known." This year, The 
Frame gallery tends to agree. Attempting to branch out, 
its directors are mixing up the notion of the stare-at-the- 
walls art show, and they are promoting diversity.
Every year, the student-run organization showcases 
artistic works of students to promote experimental art 
to the community. Art students usually dominate, but 
this year, the co-directors strove to include students 
from majors other than art and from colleges other than 
CFA. “We gave a lot of preference to people who applied 
outside of [art] and had interesting ideas,” said Michael 
Kontopoulos, co-director of The Frame. The result? “We 
got a lot of ambitious projects," he said.
He and co-director Nathan Lee are expanding upon the 
idea of a space with four walls — and not limiting the art 
space to paintings and snacks. The focus, according to 
Lee, is "really trying to create something for the space.”
The Frame began as a storefront for a pharmacy. In 
1969, Aladar Marberger, an art dealer/director, turned it 
into The Gallery, an art space. It was originally used to 
provide exhibition space for staff and students. In a span
of almost 30 years, The Gallery changed names three 
more times, finally settling on the Frame in 1998.
This year’s schedule is stuffed with different themes 
and projects. The co-directors stressed their goal of 
including art from many different types of students. 
“This semester, we did a better job than in the past [of] 
trying to schedule more shows proposed by people from 
different colleges," said Kontopoulos.
Kontopoulos and Lee’s effort to spread the word will not 
go unnoticed: On Friday, there will be a party for the 
first opening, sponsored by the School of Art. Eager to 
display the individualism and uniqueness in art, the 
director hopes that the Frame's celebration of diversity 
in art will attract people outside of CFA to the Frame.

Language barriers are all around

reminder that language and 
culture can divide us all. Brad 
Pitt and Cate Blanchett star in 
a smart, complicated movie 
about humanity, and conflict in 
the vein of Crash and Syriana. 
The plot is dense, following six 
different families from all different 
cultures as their stories twist in 
and out of each other, all tied 
together by seemingly random 
(and sometimes not-so-random) 
circumstances. It’s not exactly

other, neuroeconomics, explores how we make choices, 
investigating what occurs in the brain when we evaluate 
decisions. According to Rick, Carnegie Mellon hosted the 
first conference on neuroeconomics in May 1997.
Both of these fields are associated with decision sciences, 
an interdisciplinary field including economics, history, 
philosophy, political science, and psychology that studies 
how people make decisions, taking into account both 
neural and social aspects of decision making. Traditional 
fieldwork was done through observations and surveys, but 
advances in medical imaging are opening up a new area of 
exploration.
The use of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) 
techniques has enabled scientists to look into what exactly 
happens in the brain when a person chooses whether to buy 
the chocolate bar or the healthier sour apple, for example. 
"With neuroimaging technology, we no longer have to infer 
preferences from decisions. We can examine the formation 
of preferences in the brain," explained Rick. “Neuroimaging 
allowed us to examine whether activation in brain regions 
previously associated with the experience of pain deterred 
actual spending decisions.”
Lowenstein, along with Brian Knutson, assistant professor of 
psychology & neuroscience at Stanford University and MIT 
Sloan professor Drazen Prelec, published "Neural Predictors 
of Purchases" in the January issue of Neuron. The report 
details their findings of brain activity when people are asked 
to make spending decisions. Scientists are able to look 
directly into people’s brains to see real-time brain activity 
using fMRI machines which measure blood flow to particular 
regions of the brain. This is then represented graphically, 
using colors to indicate levels of activity, for interpretation 
and analysis.
Using fMRI techniques, the researchers showed that 
the insular complex (insula) and nucleus accumbens are 
activated when people make purchasing decisions. Previous 
research has shown that the insula is activated when one 
experiences pain. It is also associated with basic emotions 
such as anger, fear, disgust, happiness, and sadness. In the 
research, when people were shown the prices of goods that 
they could buy, this area of the brain became activated.
It was especially active for people who were classified as 
tightwads. “We found that spending money is painful," 
Knutson said.
The nucleus accumbens has a role in processing many 
rewards: sex, food (drugs), and rock and roll — it has been 
found to be involved in the regulation of emotions when 
people hear music. The accumbens was an indicator of 
preference; whether or not the person actually wanted to buy 
the product they were shown. If a slice of Union Grill’s Death 
by Chocolate looked irresistable, Lowenstein would certainly 
know.

Shopping habits are linked to brain, not reason

This is an overhaul on the classical economic orthodoxy 
and may change the way economists view people’s 
consumption choices. "Our findings challenge the standard 
consequentialist perspective of economics.... We find that 
pleasure and pain experienced at the moment of choice 
influence purchasing decisions,” stated Rick in an e-mail.
Shedding light on the complicated interplay between 
emotion and reason in the decision making process’ 
has spawned two new fields of study, both of which 
have advanced rapidly in the past six years. Affective 
psychology, the study of the integration of emotional 
and cognitive processes, evaluates processes underlying 
emotions and cognition. The
Michael Menchaca | Art Staff »
published two papers — "Tightwards and Spendthrifts" 
and "Neuroeconomics: How Neuroscience Can Inform 
Economics" — about how people make purchasing 
decisions and what they feel when they make them. The 
papers were based on brain imaging studies, which indicate 
that certain areas of the brain, responsible for both'pleasure 
and pain, are active when people decide what they want.
By observing the activation of these brain structures, 
Lowenstein and his colleagues are able to predict what 
choice people will make before they are even aware of it 
themselves.
Economists have long maintained that consumers make 
choices based on preference and price. These decisions are 
supposed to be rational choices that maximize one’s present 
and future utility. “Economics assumes that the goal of 
human behavior is to satisfy one’s preferences," explained 
Lowenstein.
More recent research, however, has discovered that parts 
of the brain associated with experiences of both pleasure 
and pain play a critical role at the moment a choice is made. 
Lowenstein and his team hypothesize that rather than 
weighing the present good versus the future alternative, 
people instead try to decide between the immediate 
pleasure of consumption and the immediate pain 
of paying for it. “People’s preferences change quite 
dramatically, sometimes moment to moment,” added 
Lowenstein.

Carnegie Mellon professor George Lowenstein probably 
isn’t an all-knowing enemy, but he can certainly tell what 
you’re going to do next. He also knows whether people are 
tightwads or spendthrifts before they even spend a dime.
Lowenstein, the Herbert A. Simon professor of economics 
and psychology in the Department of Social and Decision 
Sciences, does more than just call names. He also has the 
power to anticipate spending choices.

Based on the MRI study, Lowenstein and his team have been 
able to create a tightwad-spendthrift scale, which can classify 
people based on their propensity to make certain spending 
decisions. As part of its research, the team offered a survey to 
the Carnegie Mellon community.
Tightwads, in the anticipation of pain that will follow, tend 
to spend less than they would like. They experience an 
immediate pain of paying as they try to decide whether or 
not to get another round of beer, for example. Tightwads may 
go home sober more often than not, while spendthrifts would 
live it up. Being frugal, however, is not the same as being 
a tightwad. Frugal people actual get pleasure from saving 
money. On the flip side, spendthrifts overspend because they 
feel too little pain when making the decision.
said, "individuals can use this [information] to make better 
decisions.”
Credit cards may actually affect how people spend their 
money by mitigating the immediate pain of payment. 
Tightwads may relent and get the backrub from the blonde 
Swedish masseuse, while spendthrifts may opt for the entire 
spa package. If spendthrifts want to control their spending, 
Knutson recommends that they not use credit cards. “Credit 
cards lessen the immediate pain of paying,” he said. More 
research may show that credit cards are another product that 
shortchanges our brain circuitry into making decisions our 
rational selves may not like. Credit cards may soon be rubbing 
elbows with sugary foods, cigarettes, drugs, and alcohol in 
the world of vices.
sensitive to movement. If a person were to turn his or her 
head, the entire session would have to be restarted.
Drug companies may eventually be able to make a pill for 
chronic overspenders. Whether that day is coming soon . 
or not, the nature of economics and decision science is 
changing. Tightwads and spendthrifts alike have one thing in 
common; both of their spending habits are wrapped up in the 
brain.
According to Knutson, neuroeconomics will continue 
to evolve rapidly. “Using brain imaging to predict 
things is the next big step," he said. “I think this 
field will continue getting more interdisciplinary, 
involving economics, decision science, psychology, and 
psychiatry.”
Knutson continued, "I see this as having two 
implications: First, nobody really knows how emotions 
are implemented in decision making." Further research 
in these areas will shed light on how reason and 
emotion interact on a neurological level. "Second,” he
Ever feel like your own spending is checked by the fact that 
your money comes from home? That is actually not so. "The 
source of money often influences how it is spent. People 
are looser with ‘house money’ than they are with what they 
perceive as their own money,” explained Rick.
But does being a spendthrift or tightwad have any effect 
on happiness? On an individual level, both tightwads and 
spendthrifts are reportedly less happy than people who are 
not conflicted about buying something new or not being able 
to buy it.
Both the insula and the nucleus accumbens are located in 
an area of the brain that evolved very early and is found in 
many other species. "It’s highly probable that these brain 
areas were used for survival: Should I go into that hole or not; 
should I drink from that pond; should I chase that animal,” 
Knutson said.
Studying areas of the ancient btain, neuroeconomics is 
highly tied into evolutionary psychology as the neural 
interconnections and brain structures developed over 
the course of human existence. The evolution of 
these sections of the brain was not to make spending 
decisions, but rather to weigh choices about food, 
mating, and avoiding risks. Knutson said, "Conflicts 
between reason and passion often lead us to behave 
differently than we would ideally like to behave.”
Does this research actually indicate that tightwads are 
averse to spending any money? “George [Lowenstein] puts 
it like this: The decision is about the present good versus 
the future good.... What we are looking at is a subjective 
reaction,” Knutson explained. “It’s not the product, but how 
much we like it. It's not the price but the ridiculousness of it.” 
This means that most tightwads do not agonize about their 
spending but feel a level of increasing discomfort if they judge 
the price to be too great.
Fortunately, Knutson does not see an Orwellian future for 
shoppers, where marketers and retailers take advantage of 
advances made in neuroeconomics and figure out how to 
get you to part with your money. “This is more of a proof of 
concept,” he said. And 
his work still has a long 
way to go. The fMRI 
experiments performed

Dirty, rotten, and hilarious
Con-artistry takes the stage at the Benedum Center
Dirty Rotten Scoundrels, presented by the Pittsburgh Cultural 
Trust, kicked off its national tour this past Tuesday at the 
Benedum Center in downtown Pittsburgh. The show was off 
to a late start due to some technical difficulties, but it was well 
worth the extra wait.
Scoundrels, based on the 1988 film of the same name, is 
a comedy in every sense of the word. Tom Hewitt and D.B. 
Bonds play two con artists, Lawrence Jameson and Freddy 
Benson, respectively, who are after the sympathy and cash of 
naive women they encounter while “vacationing" in France.
Hewitt and Bonds, both talented actors in their own right, 
are even better when together. The show runs close to 2 1/2 
hours, but the two players keep the audience members on 
the edge of their seats with vicious schemes and hilarious 
reactions to surprises along the way. Lawrence, a veteran 
con artist who lives in a lavish home on the French Riviera, 
meets Freddy, a fellow charlatan, on a train traveling to 
France. When Freddy learns of his true profession, Lawrence 
agrees to take him under his wing and teach him the ropes 
of upscale con-artistry. What proceeds are various schemes 
in which Freddy and Lawrence woo a number of wealthy
women: an Oklahoma oil heir as well as an American “Soap 
Queen,” Miss Christine Colgate, who also seems to have a 
few tricks up her sleeve.
The only downside to the show is the extensive use of crude 
language and gestures by Bonds, who cannot seem to find 
a happy medium between humor and vulgarity;.after the 
first couple scenes his Jim Carrey-esque gestures become 
tiring. The extensive use of offensive language turned off 
many of the elderly audience members, who were the 
overwhelming majority at Tuesday night’s performance. One 
elderly gentleman who wished to remain anonymous admitted 
he was more interested in watching the third season of 24 
before exiting with his wife during intermission. Conversely, 
the younger members of the audience seemed less put-off. “I 
enjoy the modern storyline; I think it’s interesting,” said Louis 
Lamanna, a Pittsburgher in his teens. “I would recommend it."
Some of the show’s more popular numbers included “Great 
Big Stuff.” When this song was performed at the 2005 Tony 
Awards, some of the more suggestive lyrics were bleeped out 
for the television audience. “Stuff,” wherein Freddy runs about 
Lawrence’s lavish home while the servants carry items of silver
and crystal, is by far the most entertaining for the audience. 
Another showstopper was Laura Marie Duncan’s ethereal 
rendition of “Nothing is Too Wonderful to be True.” Duncan, 
who just came from playing the same role on Broadway, is 
incredible as the ostentatious Christine Colgate.
Unfortunately, Dirty Rotten Scoundrels had its last night 
in Pittsburgh on Sunday, though it will continue to tour 
elsewhere. Loyal to the film, the show is brimming with humor 
and features a great mix of ballads, up-tempo songs, and 
even a few rap numbers. Definitely not your typical musical 
theater show, Scoundrels is modern and refreshing.

Alcina takes a few modern twists
An opera with everything except a full house
Over the weekend, the opera Alcina had almost everything a 
spectator could want: flashy costumes and scenery, a magical 
realm, sorcery, swashbuckling, and even cross-dressing.
Based on an epic poem and produced by the School of Music, 
the opera was written by George Frideric Handel, but the 
libretto, or text of the plot, has no known author.
Alcina is a work not unlike a Shakespeare comedy in which 
lovers are crossed, identities are mistaken, and occasional 
hilarity ensues. The story follows Bradamante (junior Olivio 
Custodio) as she arrives at the island ruled by the evil 
sorceress Alcina (senior Christine Lyons) in search of her 
fiancé. Bradamante is posing as Ricciardo, her brother, but 
from the first few hilarious scenes, it becomes clear that 
Bradamante is much more the scorned lover than the brave 
knight. As she awkwardly avoids the flirtatious advances of 
Alcina's sister Morgana (senior Eve Miedel), she manages to 
find her lover — in Alcina’s arms.
Ruggiero (senior Emily Righter) is deep under Alcina's spell; 
he cannot even remember his love for Bradamante and 
thinks only of Alcina. You read that parenthetical correctly; 
Ruggiero is played by a female whereas in the time of Handel 
the part was played by a castrato, a male vocalist who had 
been castrated before puberty to preserve his higher register. 
Luckily for its male students, the School of Music decided to 
cast a woman in the role.
The opera, like any production, has been interpreted 
differently throughout the years, and in the School of Drama’s • 
presentation the scenery and costuming made for an 
interesting mix of modern and traditional with a tilt towards 
the modern. The performers wore a sort of jazzed-up version 
of the clothes you would find in pre-Revolutionary France.
The fuzzy baubles on the sleeves and colorful fur-lined cuffs 
seemed too bright to link the costumes to any particular time 
period.
The scenery, too, offered an interesting interpretation. In 
Alcina’s world, almost everything is under her spell, and so 
the palace appears beautiful and the island appears lush, 
when in reality the palace is run-down and the island is 
a desert. To capture the false finery of Alcina’s abode, the 
scenery is affixed with normal household objects (brooms, 
coat hangers, pie plates) all painted a shiny silver; it is both 
flashy and fake at the same time.
The opera features a modern flair, which seems to be 
calculated to attract an audience of Carnegie Mellon students. 
The scenes where Ruggiero and Alcina openly make 
advances on one another are quite burlesque, the audience 
members may find themselves thinking "Whoa, where is 
that hand going?” And many of the small touches, like the 
expressive face of Bradamante as she grows angrier at her 
lover, or the melodramatic swoon of Alcina as she attempts to 
sway Ruggiero, serve to make the opera truly humorous.
Yet for whatever reason, the one thing Alcina lacked on Friday 
night was a full house. This isn’t to say the show was dead, 
but there was a familiar pattern in the audience, where about 
50 percent were students and 50 percent were older patrons. 
Perhaps it was the frigid weather that kept students from 
trudging the 10 minutes over to Purnell, or perhaps the Italian 
(although there were subtitles) scared them away.
Whatever the cause, it seems that students are willing 
to wait 45 minutes for a bus to the Waterfront to watch a 
mediocre spectacle like Marie Antoinette, but might neglect 
the performances put together by so many of. their fellow 
students. The answer for breaking the opera ice could be 
classes like Passport, offered by the School of Architecture, 
that seeks to engage students in cultural and educational 
experiences in Pittsburgh. One student at Alcina Friday night, 
Joseph Liu, a senior in computer science and mathematics, 
said he loved the opera, but admitted he was there for his
Passport class. “You go to artsy events and then you write 
about them," he said. “It’s awesome."
And so was the opera, in addition to being extremely 
accessible to a student audience. But it’s too late to get more 
students to Alcina; we’ll just have to cross our fingers for next 
time.

Student game show goes meta
Scoring difficulties give rise to ethical dilemma
AB Tech’s music boomed out of Rangos 1 on Thursday.
The atmosphere was reminiscent of Who Wants to be 
a Millionaire?. Spotlights lit up the audience, building 
excitement. Technical equipment worth thousands covered 
the small room; plasma screens, laptops, and soundboards all 
came together to produce Guessthics!, an ethics game show 
brought to Carnegie Mellon by Students in Free Enterprise 
(SIFE).
SIFE’s primary purpose is to reach out and educate people 
about entrepreneurship. The group, which has grown 
from four to about 100 since 2000, is organized as a central 
executive board governing 11 different outreach projects. The 
two leaders for Guessthics! were first-years Kevin Kwan (a 
business administration major) and Alex Woo (economics).
Like its title might suggest, Guessthics! is a game show 
based on business ethics. In past years, the show was simply 
called "The Ethics Game Show" and attracted very little 
attendance. The contestants were primarily high school 
teams and the event took place in McConomy.
“We basically built the show from scratch," Woo said.
The first step was changing the title. The project leaders 
then introduced a different concept to govern the game 
and new technology. Replacing high school students, the 
contestants were members from different organizations on 
campus. The event was moved to Rangos, which was filled 
with contributions from AB Tech, cmuTV, and Information 
Technology (IT).
Another new idea was to encourage audience participation 
by distributing remote answering devices to everyone who 
entered. A buzzer system, contributed by Carnegie’s College 
Bowl team, laid on top of the tables set up for each of the 
groups. Featuring an assortment of small sandwiches and 
snacks, in addition to a bombardment of game show music, 
Guessthics! caught stares from all those walking by.
The contest was broken into three categories: “Flashback,” 
"Toss Up," and “Case Study.” Business administration major 
Lisa Ly, also a first-year, was the emcee for the show. Ly had 
to improvise a bit due to some minor technical difficulties, but 
her primary duties were to read questions to the teams and
encourage the audience to vote. Each question appeared on 
the Rangos screen, in addition to the plasmas on either side 
of the stage, for the viewing of both the audience and the 
contestants. A scoreboard was also projected off to the side of 
the stage.
“Flashback” involved multiple-choice questions that asked 
about business ethics violations in the past several years, 
such as Enron and Martha Stewart. The audience was allowed 
to guess an answer for every question, but it had no effect 
on the results of the round. On the other hand, “Toss Up” 
was formulated around audience response. After receiving a 
situation, each team would present an interpretation of and 
resolution to the problem. It was then the job of the audience 
to vote for whether or not they agreed with the response 
given. Finally, the "Case Study "round involved a question 
about Wal-Mart's underpaid workers and affordably priced 
goods. The answering order was randomized, and each team 
was able to analyze the situation and provide an opinion as to 
whether or not the government should step in and force Wal- 
Mart to provide better health care programs to its employees. 
The audience could then decide which response was the 
best, and this final round was designed to determine the 
winner.
There were four groups competing for the aforementioned 
honor. Alpha Kappa Psi (AKPsi), SIFE alumni, and the 
International Student Union (ISU) all sent representatives.
The fourth group, called “The Mob" was — in Ly’s words — “a 
group of common people representing the masses." As the 
contestants became more and more anxious about winning, 
the atmosphere grew tense with some accidental errors in 
scoring.
Based on the final scores, AKPsi's representatives were the 
winners as SIFE alumni followed close behind. However, 
many SIFE alumni protested the results, which they insisted 
included incorrect numbers from the first round. ISU agreed, 
though any mistakes would have been in their favor. The 
game show came down to a question of ethics: Should the 
prize go to SIFE, despite the team's anger when reporting the 
mistake? Should the prize go to ISU for telling the truth? Or 
should AKPsi receive a reward despite the mistakes on the 
scoreboard?
Ultimately, Kwan and Woo chose to leave it up to the 
audience. Each team was permitted 10 seconds to plead its 
case. Kohta Wajima, a senior on the SIFE alumni team, tried 
to feed off of the humor of the situation and simultaneously 
plead for his team, saying, "We just wanted the truth to come 
out. We did not have sexual relations.... [We] wanted the truth 
to come out under ethical circumstances." In the end, his 
testimony didn’t help them. The audience surprised everyone 
with their choice for the winner: The Mob.
Each team, however, received a partial prize. The audience 
members were also able to share in the benefits. Guessthics! 
had many raffles that gave out prizes such as a sled, stainless 
steel mugs, a George Foreman grill, and an iLamp (a lamp that 
plays your iPod). The spotlight randomly chose people from 
the audience to try their luck.
After all this elaborate design, it's hard to imagine the amount 
of money Guessthics! required. Kwan and Woo, though, 
reported that the price of the game show actually came under 
budget at approximately $1500. Junior Eugene Gaysinskiy, 
SIFE’s current president, said that most of SIFE's money 
comes from “the business department, Student Senate, and 
corporate sponsors." Another big contributor is the prize 
money that SIFE wins from its annual regional and national 
meets that they usually excel in.
It’s impressive that Guessthics! was created, planned, and 
executed by the two first-years, Kwan and Woo. Gaysinskiy 
commented on their work, “About 60 people applied to be 
project leaders and from that we picked 15. To be a project 
leader as a freshman, you have to be really good.”
Kwan and Woo led a team to make Guessthics! happen, 
delegating different aspects of the show to each member of 
the team. Did it help lessen the workload over the past few 
months? “No," said Kwan, "this has been my SIFE.”

Of course this information won’t really matter when you’re scaling 
behemoths in an effort to discover an ancient truth.
The simple task of trying to locate the president’s daughter will go 
horrifyingly wrong when it becomes apparent that everyone you see 
wants to eat you. It’s worth it, though, because you know that she’s 
totally hot. •
I know that no one hates giant killer brains as much as you do, but this 
time around, it’s your job to save one. I know it sounds harsh, but if you 
do it fast enough, you’ll be'pleasantly surprised.
Get ready for an epic adventure as you travel through time to save the 
world. If you don’t feel like being a hero, though, you can always just go 
fishing until the whole thing blows over.
Everybody loves a nice drive, but besides snowy roads, beware of 
damned dirty apes chucking bananas and those pesky red shells. Don’t 
bother listening to the traffic report because they’ll have ho idea what 
you’re going through.
You and your buddies will have a blast as you take turns fighting evil. 
Of course, they’ll all be jealous that you get to have the seven-foot, 
sword.
What? You still haven’t found the blue key? You need that to move on. 
Just backtrack a bit and I’m sure it’ll turn up.
