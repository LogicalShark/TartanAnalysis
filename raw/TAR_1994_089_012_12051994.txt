This past weekend marked CMU’s 
Greek system’s first open attempt at the 
bring your own beer (BYOB) policy. The 
fraternities Pi Kappa Alpha (PiKA) and 
Delta Tau Delta (DTD) took the initia­
tive to try two BYOB partieslast Friday 
and Saturday night.
The issue of BYOB on campus has 
been circling the Greek system for the 
past few years.
Questions ofliability and finance have 
turned fraternities at other schools to a 
policy where the fraternity will not have 
to provide beer for everyone who attends 
their parties.
The Interfratemity Counsel has this 
semester begun to look at ideas and 
suggestions about BYOB, but PiKA and 
DTD decided to sponsor the parties on 
their own. The two houses made it a 
joint effort from the beginning, having 
one party at PiKA on Friday, and the 
second at DTD on Saturday. Posters
went up on Wednesday of last week to 
advertise the party, and it specifically 
said it was a BYOB party and any ques­
tions about how it would work, could be 
answered by a brother in either frater­
nity.
If a non-fraternity member attends 
the party and wants to drink, that per­
son must bring his or her own beer, in 
cans only, to the door and will be issued 
tickets for the number of beers brought. 
To redeem these, the tickets are pre­
sented to the bartender.
JeffBricker, PiKA’s Social Chair said 
that at Friday’s first party, “about six 
people brought cases to the party.” 
Bricker said the number was fairly low, 
but because of the short notice, not as 
many people were encouraged to BYOB.
Reaction to the party was fairly posi­
tive. Kristy Partovi, a freshman in MCS 
said “[the party] really wasn’t that dif­
ferent.” Kara Yamot, a Senior Policy 
and Management major, and the presi­
dent of Delta Gamma sorority said that 
the reaction she heard from members of
her house was “it didn’t really seem to 
matter, they still had a good time.” As 
far as turnout goes, Melissa Murello, a 
freshman in H&SS said, “I thought it 
was definitely a smaller party.”
DTD’s party Saturday night was de­
scribed as “very crowded,” by several 
students and Vanessa Novissimo, a 
sophomore Çrench/Creative Writing 
double major said, “I was having a really 
good time ... and there was not at all a 
difference [because of BYOB]”
Eric Nemoseck. the TFC President 
said that IFC “thought we’d look into it 
because it’s a trend.” But IFC has so far 
not received any pressure from the Uni­
versity itself to try a BYOB policy.
Some members of the administration 
have even said they are opposed to the 
idea. Nemoseck said “some fraternities 
hâve gotten a little pressure from their 
nationals.”
CMU has been different because on 
most BYOB campuses, it is the 
university’s administration itself that

On November 17, a propos 
was passed by the Presidenti 
Committee on Dining (PCOE 
jvhich requested that the pr 
posed move of the Wean Hall fo( 
jcarts to Building D would n 
Jjccur, and CMU administratic 
has approved the proposal.
Instead of moving the enti 
setup, the committee proposed 
'move Wean Wok. According 
;the proposal, the carts which a 
pow in the fifth floor lobby 
'Wean Hall will be “streamline«
¡by “moving both cart operatioi 
!to one side of the lobby.” T1 
proposal also stated that tabli 
and chairs could be placed in tl 
vacated area. “These tables ai 
chairs would not overcrowd tl 
lobby, but merely provide son 
places to sit, work, and/or eal 
The carts will also be accepting 
pampusXpress and DineXpress 
beginning next semester.
According to Brenden Mielke, 
¦a freshman IM major and chair of 
the Presidential Committee on 
Dining, the decision was made to 
propose to stop the Building D 
move after the opinions of people 
jnvolved were considered. Mielke 
d, “There was a lot of student 
'and faculty and staff outrage 
¡.[about the move]... a small group 
decided to move [the carts].”
Morewood Gardens has gone a long way from what it looked like at the start of the semester. (Left) The main entree was served only on chaffing 
dishes, and there were no other alternatives for food. (Right) Now, Morewood provides salads, deli sandwiches, and frozen yogurt.
The combination of the carts also a factor. Mielke said, “We

“Residents of Wean don’t care for 
it,” Mielke said. The PCOD is 
currently surveying possible

dining area, but he did not have a 
comment on moving Wean Wok 
to Baker/Porter. He did say that

If anything, they will increase.” 
With the exception of the food 
carts, there is nowhere to eat on 
the west side of campus. This was
due to the fact that Wean will 
retain deli-style food.
Installing CampusXpress and 
DineXpress in Wean has been 
delayed until next semester since 
there would be a large increase in
the use of CampusXpress and 
DineXpress. Hamlin said that 
“speed of transaction will offset 
increase in volume.” Both types 
of payment will be made avail­
able next semester.
The Wean food cart situation is 
not the only issue on which the 
PCOD is working. In the same 
proposal which dealt with the 
Wean carts, it was proposed to 
upgrade the vending machines in 
various academic buildings, to 
include serving hot coffee and 
fresh sandwiches.
Possible locations for the new 
machines would be the Baker/ 
Porter complex and the Scaife 
area. There is a possible leasing 
plan already in place to obtain 
the machines. In order to allow 
sufficient time for the leasing and 
stocking of the machines, the pro­
posed rollout would be around 
the middle of the spring semes­
ter.
This is an option which Hamlin 
feels is quite viable. “I’m confi­
dent [about its success] from 
past experience,” he said. Appar­
ently, there is a somewhat neu­
tral feeling from the campus popu­
lation about this. There is also 
some concern that fresh foods 
such as sandwiches and milk 
could spoil. However, there would 
be great care taken in dating the 
food.

PAT feels Pitt shuttle will conflict with their route
Natalie Wochele/Tartan Photographer
Students use the PAT buses to go to many parts of the city of Pittsburgh. PAT has 
fold the University of Pittsburgh that its shuttle infringes on their route.
By HEATHER ZINDLE
Tartan Staffwriter
As of the first of the new year, the 
University of Pittsburgh shuttle service 
that serves the Squirrel Hill and 
Shadyside areas will no longer be run­
ning. Port Authority of Allegheny 
County, (PAT) has determined that those 
Pitt routes directly conflict with its own 
routes, and are taking riders off of PAT 
buses.
The Pitt shuttle system uses coach 
buses through a private line, thus there 
is a private system on public ground. 
According to Michael Grant, a masters 
student in public policy and manage­
ment who is studying this problem, PAT 
basically has authority over all bus ser­
vice providers in Allegheny County.
This does not affect any other routes, 
such as North and South Oakland, or 
Carnegie Mellon’s own shuttle service
routes.
This change, however, raises many 
questions for both Pitt and CMU stu­
dents.
According to Julie Crowell, Pitt’s Stu­
dent Body president elect, it had been 
proposed before that Pitt students could 
buy discounted bus passes for those 
routes, but the number of students that 
wanted to btiy the passes did not give 
enough of a discount.
Right now, Pitt students pay a $40 fee 
for transportation, and now that money 
for the Squirrel Hill and Shadyside 
routes will go directly to PAT.
Pitt students will be able to ride to 
Squirrel Hill and Shadyside areas using 
the PAT buses by showing their ID.
Starting January 1, 1995 this pro­
gram will be implemented on a trial 
basis, and, if it works out, the system 
could becom a permanent concept. 
Crowell is “anxious to see how this pe­
riod goes,” but is also “apprehensive, 
because on the Pitt shuttle buses, be­
cause it was a private line, students 
knew the buses were clean and safe.” 
There are also concerns about crowd­
ing and adequate service.
Right now, Tony De Simone, a junior 
civil engineering major who uses the 
Squirrel Hill Pitt buses to get to his off- 
campus apartment, said “some nights 
the Pitt buses are already really 
crowded.”
The riders on the Pitt buses would be 
combined with the PAT riders, as a re­
sult of the combined system, the buses 
could become overcrowded making it 
uncomfortable for many of the riders 
who frequent the bus line.
This also raises some questions con­
cerning CMU riders.
According to CMU police, students 
will still be able to ride Pitt buses next 
semester.

PORTAGE, Wisconsin, November29
— It is believed that serial killer Jef­
frey Dahmer, imprisoned for mutilat­
ing and eating his victims, may have 
been murdered by a fellow inmate who 
thought he was the son of God. The 
attack took place in a bathroom at the 
Columbia Correctional Institution.
Christopher Scarver was named as 
the number one suspect in the prison 
toilet beating which lead to the death. 
Scarver is a 25-year old black man 
who has a history of mental problems. 
In 1992 Scarver was convicted of an 
execution-style murder in Milwaukee.
Scarver was workingjanitorial duty 
with Dahmer and another inmate, 
Jesse Anderson. Anderson was also 
injured in the attack. The suspect was 
found with blood all over his clothes.
The officials at the prison do not 
believe that the attack was racially 
motivated even though both victims 
were white. Scarver had been in the 
mental ward of the prison and was 
treated.
Officials, though, never felt he was
antisocial or violent.
There will not .be a rush to charge 
Scarver since he is already serving a 
life sentence.
The two inmates that may have ob­
served the attack were being held with 
Scarver in segregated units at the 
maximum security establishment. The 
actual attack is stitl under investiga­
tion. It is unsure if fellow inmates 
helped in the attack or set it up.
Anderson was discovered beaten in 
a shower stallin the gymnasium while 
Dahmer was barley alive nearby. He 
died from multiple skull fractures, and 
brain trauma.
Even though a bloody broom handle 
was located at the scene, officials say 
that the walls may have been used for 
the attack.
Dahmer had confessed to the mur­
der of 17 males over the span of 13 
years.
Experts feel that Dahmer may have 
been singled out because of his celeb­
rity status and the media circus over 
the case.

WASHINGTON, D.C., December 2 
(D J) — The Uruguay Round of the Gen­
eral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 
(GATT), ratified by the U.S. Congress 
yesterday, includes a number of signifi­
cant business tax changes aimed at off­
setting the pact’s $11.9 billion cost over 
the first five years.
The GATT legislation raises $800 mil­
lion over five years by reducing the in­
terest rate the government pays on cer­
tain corporate tax overpayments of more 
than $10,000. It will also raise $95. mil­
lion by stiffening the penalty for a corpo­
rate tax underpayment attributed to a 
tax shelter.
“The provision relating to the change 
in the rate of interest is actually fairly 
significant,” said attorney Kathleen 
Ferrell of Davis, Polk & Wardwell. “It’s 
a pure revenue grab. There’s no policy 
justification.”
The bill would raise $211 million over 
five years by taxing, with certain excep­
tions, partnership distribution of mar­
ketable securities.
Ferrell described the provision as 
“fairly generic,” noting it does not hit 
any particular industry.
Some $1.39 billion in revenue will be 
raised by provisions that tighten the 
way the government taxes so-called Sec­
tion 936 companies, which have manu­
facturing operations in U.S. territories.
An additional $900 million will be 
raised over five years by instituting plans 
to reform and strengthen the Pension 
Benefit Guaranty Corp. The bill, among 
other things, will increase employer con­
tributions to the PBGC and require com­
panies with underfunded pension plans 
to replenish them more quickly than is 
the case now.
Peter Sutherland, head of GATT, said 
that U.S. congressional passage of the 
agreement was a “triumph” that will 
help make the world a more prosperous 
place.
“This is a day for particular celebra­
tion,” Sutherland told journalists.
“The successful culmination of this 
debate proved that common sense still 
works.”
U.S. congressional clearance of the 
new world trade accord is expected to 
encourage ratification by other coun­
tries, allowing the mammoth export- 
boosting pact to take effect as planned 
on January 1.
Large and small nations alike are try­
ing to rush the 22,000-page GATT agree­
ment through national parliaments, of­
ten in low-key processes compared to 
the rocky ride through Congress.
Accident finishes 
player’s career
KIRKLAND, Wash., December 1 — 
Seattle Seahawks tackle Michael Frier 
was paralyzed Thursday from the waist 
down when the car he was riding in hit 
a utility pole.
Star running back Chris Warren was 
driving the vehicle.
Warren was released early Friday 
morning after only suffering two cracked 
ribs. The third person in the car was 
running back Lamar Smith. He was 
hospitalized overnight due to chip frac­
tures in his ankle and spine.
Frier’s neck was broken, and he dislo­
cated his neck between the fifth and 
sixth vertebrae. There was also severe 
damage done to the spinal cord. Doctors 
said there was no chance he would play 
football again. Frier was expected to go 
into surgery on Friday.
The crash occurred around 8:40 pm 
near the Seahawks’ training facility. 
According to Smith, Warren was driving 
faster than normal whichwas especially 
dangerous on the rain-slick roads.
When the car hit the pole, the pole lit 
up in flames. Warren was arrested at 
the scene on charges of vehicular as­
sault.
Passers by and firefighters had to help 
pull the victims out of the car.
Neither Police nor the coaching staff 
would comment on whether drugs or 
alcohol were involved in the accident.
Employment rate 
rises in New York
NEW YORK, December 2 (DJ) — 
Jobless rates dropped slightly in the 
New York region in November, with the 
city registering a drop of 0.7 percentage 
points from the previous month, the 
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics said.
In his monthly repdrt, Regional Direc­
tor Samuel Ehrenhalt said 7.5 percent 
of the city’s civilian labor force was un­
employed, down from 8.2 percent in Oc­
tober. Statewide, the jobless rate 
dropped to 6.3 percent from 6.5 percent, 
while New Jersey showed a drop to 6.6 
percent from 6.7.
In raw figures, New York City had 
243,000 unemployed in November, com­
pared with 271,000 in October. The state 
had 538,000 people out of work, com­
pared with 561,000 in October; New 
Jersey had 266,000, down from 277,000 
in the previous month.
The civilian labor force is the total 
number of people working and those 
actively seeking employment. Ehrenhalt 
said the figure for New York state in 
November was 8.58 million, with 3.23 
million of those in New York City. New 
Jersey’s was 4.05 million.
Jobless rates have fluctuated in re­
cent months, with the city’s ranging 
between 8.4 percent and 10.8 percent 
between January and August and drop­
ping to a low of 7.2 percent in Septem­
ber. That month saw 6.2 percent, also a 
low, statewide.
The figures are based on sample sur­
veys of 2,200 households in New York 
City, 5,200 statewide, and 2,300 in New 
Jersey. They are seasonally adjusted 
and subject to unspecified sampling er­
ror.
Ehrenhalt said the statistics are not 
directly comparable with previous years 
because the survey was redesigned last 
January, and incorporates population 
criteria from the 1990 U.S. Census.
President meets 
with Republicans
WASHINGTON, D.C., December 2, 
(DJ) — President Clinton indicated he 
wouldn’t rule out working with Republi­
cans on some of their ideas for cutting 
taxes, but said any tax cuts must be 
offset by other items in the budget to 
prevent increasing the deficit.
In a speech to the National League of 
Cities, Clinton said “we need more tax 
fairness” in the tax system for working 
citizens. He said the middle class should 
receive a “dividend” for the end of the 
Cold War and the downsizing of the 
government that has taken place.
“But most hard-working Americans 
have an interest in keeping the deficit 
under control,” said Clinton.
He said that while he favors doing 
something for the middle class and 
wouldn’t rule out working with the Re­
publican Congres s on some of their ideas 
for changing the tax code, he will insist 
that any tax cut benefit the middle class 
and be “paid for” so as not to boost the 
deficit.
Kuwait builds up 
defensive force
KUWAIT, December 2 (DJ) — U.S. 
and Kuwaiti military commanders will 
start a command and control exercise 
billed as the largest of its kind since the 
Gulf War, the army announced.
The emirate’s Deputy Chief of Staff, 
Maj. Gen. Fahad al-Amir, told reporters 
the five-day exercise, code named Ulti­
mate Resolve, will begin Saturday.
Commanders from Britain, France, 
Arab Gulf states, Syria, and Egypt will 
participate as observers.
Al-Amir said the exercise is designed 
to tackle the “difficulties and obstacles 
that occur in real operations,” and dem­
onstrate that “the spirit” of the 33-na- 
tion U.S. led coalition that fought Iraq in 
the 1991 Gulf War to liberate Kuwait 
“still exists.”
Last month, Kuwait’s western i 
rushed troops, warplanes, and warships 
to the region to counter an Iraqi military 
buildup near the border that was per. 
ceived as a threat to the tiny emirate 
which Saddam Hussein’s army invaded 
in 1990.
Iraq pulled back its troops and recog. 
nized Kuwait as a sovereign state after 
Russian mediation.
Al-Amir said that the first phase of 
Ultimate Resolve will be restricted to 
planning sessions at high command lev­
els, but the exercise will later expand to 
joint maneuvers in the desert with the 
allies that could continue, on and off, for 
two years.
He conceded that while Kuwait’s small 
military cannot deter an Iraqi threat on 
its own, it will in the next few years be 
capable of engaging aggressors until its 
allies can deploy forces to support it.
Gov’t plans new 
nuclear inventory
WASHINGTON, D.C., December 1 
(DJ) — The Energy Department will 
require annual inventories of “high-risk 
property” as part of a new effort to pre­
vent dissemination of hardware or in­
formation that could contribute to 
nuclear proliferation.
The new interim guidelines, outlined 
in a November 10 memo and two accom­
panying booklets, were issued in re­
sponse to an August 3 Wall Street Jour­
nal article about a Pocatello, Idaho used- 
car dealer who purchased major parts of 
a nuclear reprocessor from the 
department’s Idaho National Engineer­
ing Laboratory. The used-car dealer, Tom 
Johansen, also obtained blueprints and 
other data about the reprocessor from 
the Idaho lab. Neither the hardware nor 
the data were classified, but the sale 
caused considerable concern at the 
Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the 
State Department, and the Energy De­
partment. The memo, written by En­
ergy Undersecretary Charles Curtis, and 
the two booklets were made public by 
the Energy Department yesterday.
Under the interim guidelines, which 
are expected to become permanent after 
a period for public comment, employees 
of the Energy Department and its pri­
vate contractors are required to deter­
mine whether material to be sold is 
“proliferation-sensitive.” If so, it must 
be rendered “unusable for nuclear pur­
poses” prior to sale, and in some cases 
must be destroyed rather than sold.

Tartan Junior Staffwriter
Last week, on November 28, Carnegie 
Mellon and the Monterrey Technical 
Institute (Instituto Technologico y de 
gstudios Superiores de Monterrey), a 
prominent Mexican University, demon­
strated a pioneering and innovative me­
dium for teaching. Through a combina­
tion of satellites, broadcasting stations, 
and more than 10 receiving stations
• across Mexico, Carnegie Mellon and 
Monterrey Tech have established the 
CMU-ITESM Institute for Strategic De­
velopment. It may sound like a scene 
from Star Trek, but last week’s demon­
stration showed that teachers can be 
literally put on screen, where they can 
been seen and heard by students in a 
class thousands of miles away.
Last week’s demonstration, in which
President Rafael Rangel of ITESM and 
President Robert Mehrabian of Carnegie 
Mellon participated, displayed one of 
the classes that began this fall as part of 
the Institute for Strategic Development 
program. The class, titled “Managing 
Software Development,” is being taught 
by James Tomayko, professor of Com­
puter Science.
Unlike other classes at CMU, the Sat­
urday sections of “Managing Software 
Development” have no students in the 
class, at least not at Carnegie Mellon. 
Students attend the class in Mexico. 
This is made possible by broadcasting 
the class live via satellite to the 
Monterrey Campus of ITESM. Accord­
ing to Tomayko, the signal is then sent 
up to another satellite which transmits 
the signal to Mexico City. From there, 
the signal is relayed to the same satel­
lite again to 14 of Monterrey Tech’s
campuses.
Students attending the class can ask 
questions during the class session or 
turn in homework via computer link, 
fax, or phone. Through a computer link, 
Tomayko can also stay in contact with 
the Assistant Professor of the class, Ralf 
Eder Lange, a computer science profes­
sor at ITESM. As with other classes, 
homework is graded and credit is 
awarded toward a degree, a master’s 
degree in this case.
Through the Institute for Strategic 
Development, there are also graduate 
student exchanges and cooperation be­
tween the faculty of the two universi­
ties. In the future, Tomayko said that 
there would be other courses taught 
through the program as well as joint 
teaching of classes via satellite with 
professors from Mexico. Professor Paul 
Goodman, who is affiliated with the
Graduate School of Industrial Adminis­
tration and serves as CMU’s director for 
the Institute for Strategic Development, 
said in a press release that he believes 
that ITESM and Carnegie Mellon can 
work on future programs “that will have 
an impact throughout Latin America, 
and ultimately the world.”
According to Tomayko, the purpose of 
the program is to “work cooperatively 
with industry in Mexico and the U.S. on 
joint research and development [as well 
as on] various educational projects.” 
According to the press release, 
Goodman sees the program as a step­
ping stone to an envisioned “virtual uni­
versity” which “bridges space, time, and 
physical facilities such as classrooms 
and libraries.” Goodman noted that “in 
the future, we will be able to give stu­
dents around the world an opportunity 
to learn from the best teachers no mat­
ter where they are.” Tomayko sees thé 
program as beneficial for ITESM in that 
students at 14 of its 26 campuses will 
have an “opportunity to take a coursé 
that does not exist at their home univerj 
sity.” He sees long term gains for 
Carnegie Mellon as well, stating, “I think 
the main advantage for CMU is working 
with very bright people in a different 
country because you get different per­
spectives.” The Institute of Strategic De­
velopment is not the only program at 
Carnegie Mellon through which students 
outside of Carnegie Mellon can attend 
via satellite.
Another program is run through thé 
National Technological University based 
in Fort Collins, Colorado.
Carnegie Mellon is part of this “vir-i 
tual university” which consists of a group 
of universities which broadcasts classes 
via satellite.

an 1FC issue and we would de­
cide.”
The question of liability has 
surrounded BYOB. If someone 
drinks at a fraternity party and 
gets hurt after they leave, in­
vestigators want to know who 
provided the alcohol and the 
place to drink it.
By going BYOB, some of the 
responsibility is taken off the 
fraternity because they did not 
provide the person with the 
beer.
There is also a financial ques­
tion involved. As it is now, fra­
ternities are consistently 
spending money buying cases 
of beer to serve to their paity- 
goers but Bricker said, '“with 
the money we save on beer, we 
could do different kinds of par­
ties.”
He said they would make the 
effort to “not have your average 
fraternity party.”
He said ideas about theme
parties and live bands have 
been discussed and also creat­
ing an environment where “you 
can talk to people — not just 
dance with loud music."
The sororities on campus 
have also supported the idea of 
BYOB.
Yamot said, “my house is 
very supportive of the BYOB 
policy and we hope the steps 
toward it will continue.”
Yarnot sees the advantages 
of BYOB as cutting down on 
risk management and creat­
ing more innovative program­
ming. “Parties could revolve 
around things other than 
drinking,” said Yamot.
BYOB would also not affect 
fràternity/sorority pre-mixers. 
As long as it is a closed mixer, 
the fraternity can serve what­
ever they want.
After the parties, the IFC 
and members of PiKA andDTD 
will evaluate how they went. 
Brieker said they want to “wait 
and think things over.” He said, 
“We’re keeping our minds 
open.”

Crime and Incident Reports
11/19 MISSING PERSON,
2:34 am. A father contacted cam­
pus police to report that his 
daughter had not yet returned 
home. He said she should be work­
ing in Hamburg Hall and her car 
would be in the back parking lot. 
A survey of Hamburg Hall and 
the parking lot resulted in nega­
tive results. A description of the 
girl was then broadcasted. The 
father was notified and told to 
call Campus Police again in case 
the daughter returned. By 4:15 
am, the daughter had still not 
returned home. Police began to 
search for the female. With the 
assistance of a student, the police 
discovered that the missing girl 
had not logged on to her e-mail 
account since November 18 at 
12:33 pm.
11/19 HARASSMENT BY 
COMMUNICATION, 6:41 pm.
- Campus police were dispatched, 
to Morewood Gardens where a 
female reported that she had re­
ceived sexually explicit e-mail 
from a male that she did not know. 
The letter was sent to the victim 
and four other females, none of 
whom the victim knew. The let­
ter said, “Hi there! You probably
don’t know me, but I think you’re 
sexy and I want to fuck you all 
night long. I want you to suck my 
big fat dick and then I want to 
shove it up your ass. PLEASE 
respond to this letter. My e-mail
address is ____. I want to lick
your luscious tits and eat your 
cherry pie. Romeo and Juliet 
never fucked this way. Vous lez 
vous couchez mois mademoiselle. 
Je vous aime oh la la.”
11/22 UNDERAGE POSSES­
SION OF ALCOHOL, 2:29 am. 
Campus police responded to an 
excessive noise complaint in 
Mudge C-Tower. When police ar­
rived, there was an empty case.of 
beer in the hallway. One of the 
rooms had a tabletop that was 
full of empty cans of beer. The 
resident of the room said that the 
noise was from people leaving
the party. He was reminded it 
was a school night by campus 
police. The resident’s breath 
smelled of alcohol.
11/26 PUBLIC DRUNK-
ENESS, 4:16 am. A female stu­
dent was crossing Forbes Ave. 
when she encountered a male 
with a dark coat. He asked her if 
she was a movie producer. She 
got scared and ran into Morewood 
Gardens where she called cam­
pus police. Police caught up with 
the actor who was obviously 
drunk. He was told not to return 
to the campus or he would be 
placed under arrest.
Later, police received a call 
that the same man was on the 
steps of Warner Hall shouting 
and talking to himself. The man 
was immediately placed under 
arrest.
The Tartan prints the weekly 
Crime and Incident report under 
the following guidlines:
• Chief of Campus Police, James 
LaPaglia, reviews all reports prior 
to release.
• Only three people on The Tar­
tan staff see the reports: the Edi- 
tor-in-Chief the News Editor, and 
the staffwriter typing the report.
• All personal names of com­
plainants, victims, suspects, and 
fraternity names are omitted from 
the printed report. Ethnic descrip­
tions and other personal details 
are given only in the context of 
complete descriptions.
• Not every incident that occurs 
on campus appears in the report.

Dispensers for hot beverages, 
such as coffee, are another possi­
bility about which Hamlin feels 
positive. “I’d like to have hot bev­
erage dispensers in all high traf­
fic areas,” he said. “They pay for 
themselves.”
There is a possibility of outside 
dining establishments other than 
Domino’s Pizza becoming acces­
sible through CampusXpress and 
pineXpress. The contract with 
Domino’s is being researched. If 
it is not an exclusive contract, 
Hamlin would like to provide 
some competition for Domino’s.
Hamlin is also looking at invit­
ing other outside establishments, 
both local and national, on cam- 
. pus. “We want to have a local 
business presence on campus,” 
he said. Mielke added that na­
tional chains such as Pizza Hut, 
McDonalds, and Boston Rôtis­
serie Chicken are being consid­
ered.
He is also looking to the future 
with the opening of the Univer­
sity Center in the fall of 1996. 
“We will have a combination of 
national and local brands in the 
University Center, in addition to 
Scotland Yard.” According to stu­
dent body president Declan 
McCullagh, “Scotland Yard is 
going to open January 20.” The 
location is in the Faculty/Staff 
Dining Room. McCullagh said 
that there “will be a smoking sec­
tion as well.” The delay in open­
ing is due to the fact that the 
original decorations could not be 
located at this time.

Students wait in line to receive the variety of food that the Highlander 
Cafe has to offer.
Mielke said, the PCOD will be 
“looking at food plans for next 
year.” These plans include new 
vegetarian options, extended late- 
night hours, and an improvement 
in food quality.
As always, student input is 
encouraged. Recently, Dining 
Services has been accepting com­
ments through yellow note cards 
placed in Morewood Gardens and 
Highlander Cafe.
“People can get their point 
across using the yellow cards,” 
Mielke said. “They do get acted 
on.”
“There’s been a lot of positive 
input,” said Hamlin. “Sometimes 
people think the comments would 
be snide ... [but] eight out of ten
[suggestions] have a comment for 
improving the business.”
When improvements are made 
according to student comments, 
there will be cards indicating that, 
in order to assure the students 
that their comments are being 
considered.
There has been substantial 
change concerning dining on cam­
pus in the past semester.
Mielke feels this is a positive 
thing, and he attributes it to 
Hamlin, who is concluding his 
first semester as Director of Din­
ing Services.
“[He’s] been a really good re­
source ... We’ve appreciated the 
support from administration and 
faculty,” Mielke said.

A press conference was held 
on Monday afternoon in the 
Hillel Center on South Craig 
Street for Edgar Bronfman. 
Bronfman, who is the chair­
man and chief executive officer 
of Seagrams Company Ltd., 
was speaking on campus life 
for the Jewish people.
Bronfmanis a substantial do­
nator to the Hillel International 
Center, from which the Hillel 
Center inPittsburgh is directly 
funded. Art Donsky, Director 
of Pittsburgh Hillel, said, “Mr. 
Bronfman is one of the biggest, 
if not the biggest, contributor 
to the Hillel Foundation.”
Bronfman invests a lot more 
than his money, though. He is 
the President of the World Jew­
ish Congress, and is an active 
member of the Jewish commu­
nity.
He has spent the fall making 
a tour of campuses and trying 
to find ways to improve the 
campus life of the Jewish stu­
dents. According to Donsky, 
there are about 400,000 Jewish
college students in universities 
all over North America and the 
Hillel Foundation spends about 
$50 per student on activities and 
campus relations. “Mr. Bronfman 
says he would like to see that 
amount doubled.” said Donsky,
Speaking to the General As­
sembly Council for the Jewish 
people, Bronfman outlined his 
intentions iorthe type ofimprove- 
ments that he’d like to see in 
campus relations for Jewish stu­
dents. ‘'There are three major 
Jewish organizations spending 
millions of dollars tracking anti­
semitism in America right now. 
We need to stop counting the 
swastika’s on the walls of men’s 
restrooms and start spending that 
money where it will do some good, 
on the Jewish college students 
around the country.”
In following up on his state­
ments, Bronfman went online on 
Monday to send a message to 
thousands of Jewish students at 
once.
.Ruth Slater, the programming 
associate for CMU from the Jew­
ish University Center said, “We’re 
absoIutelythrilledthatBronfman 
is taking such an active role in
the Jewish campus community. 
We also have every confidence 
that he will continue to bring to 
us a new era in student involve­
ment across the nation.”
For the press confex’ence on 
Monday, Donsky has contacted 
only a few small publications. 
“We’re tryingto keep this from 
becoming a big TV production. 
We’ve invited all of the stu­
dents that wish to attend, and 
The Pittsburgh Jewish Chron­
icle. which is a small newspa­
per publication here in Pitts­
burgh. We want to keep things 
on a personal level for the stu­
dents. The Jewish population 
has one of the lowest, if not the 
lowest, birth rates of any major 
group in; the United States. On 
average the couples that have 
child-bearing capabilities only 
have about 1.7 or 1.8 children 
per household. This is much 
lower than the national aver­
age for other groups in the U.S.” 
In addition to the 3:30 pm 
press conference and the on­
line message, there was also a 
luncheon for Bronfman in the 
Student Center on the drill 
deck. Monday.

In response to the recent deci­
sion by the administration to 
-censor sexually explicit bboards, 
the Faculty Senate, the Student 
Senate, and the Staff Counsel 
lhave all passed resolutions say­
ing that the University made a 
mistake and should reconsider. 
Hence, the Administration set 
up a committee to make recom­
mendations to the President. 
¦Instead of a representative and 
voluntary committee, the Uni­
versity designated its chair, Vice 
Provost for Education, Erwin 
Steinberg, and in turn, he hand- 
selected the other members. 
Steinberg only chose two stu­
dents to sit on his committee. 
The rest of the members are 
faculty and staff.
This committee is not exactly 
representative of the students 
ofCMU.
Not only has Steinberg stacked 
the committee against students, 
he will not allow any concerned 
students or reporters from the 
Associated Press and the Tar­
tan to attend meetings.
The minutes posted to the 
cmu.official.news bboard are ap­
proved by the committee before 
they are released, therefore, 
they do not include all of the 
meeting’s discussion, only what 
they want us to hear.
With so many students, fac­
ulty, and staff all making rec­
ommendations to the Univer­
sity about the bboard decision, 
why haven’t they responded? 
Where is President Mehrabian? 
The last we heard, he stepped 
out five minutes before the 
“Freedom in Cyberspace” rally 
for an important “lunch.”
The administration doesn’t lis­
ten to the students who attend 
CMU. For the bboard issue, the 
university seems to have side­
stepped the real issue by setting 
up a committee that will have 
no real student input — not to 
mention that the committee is 
not allowing information from 
the meetings to be given to any­
one not on the committee.
We would recommend that the 
administration conduct more 
surveys and open forums. They 
set up Student Advisory Coun­
sels like the President’s and Vice 
President’s SAC but again, these 
students are hand-picked. When 
the purpose of SAC is to get 
interested and concerned stu­
dents involved, anyone should 
be allowed to attend and every­
one should be encouraged to 
participate.
This is a strong and presti­
gious University and the stu­
dents who graduate from it are 
intelligent and independent. It’s 
about time CMU’s administra­
tion acknowledged that, got in 
touch with the student body, 
and listened to what we have to 
say.

The Christmas and Hanuk- 
kah decorations in dining halls 
and other buildings on campus 
commemorate only two of the 
many holidays celebrated by the 
diverse student body. The festi­
val of Kwanza is overlooked, as 
are the beliefs of all the non- 
Jewish and non-Christian stu­
dents of which there are many.
Since the University can’t deco­
rate for all religions, beliefs, and 
customs, the University 
shouldn’t decorate at all.
This is not to say that religion 
should be discouraged, or that 
the University should not pro­
mote it. Religion certainly 
should be. But there are many 
clubs which do make religious 
observation accessible, and trees 
and tinsel do as much to teach 
one about Christmas as eggs
smrguCr[­ SrFFfDg
teach one about Easter. The Uni­
versity should not emphasize 
decorating with these commer­
cialized symbols—-leaveit to stu­
dents in the privacy of their own 
rooms.
The University must be more 
sensitive to the diversity of its 
students. Though a Christmas 
tree isn’t the same thing as a 
cross, it is still seen as a reli­
gious symbol, having religious 
connotations, not the least of 
which is the acceptance of Jesus 
as the Savior. The University 
should not take any specific re­
ligious stance; however, it 
should provide an open and tol­
erant environment for all reli­
gious beliefs. Displaying deco­
rations from a few select reli­
gions displays bias and favorit-
It seems to us that the only 
thing ’’offensive“ in the above 
editorial is its stench of political 
correctness. Since when do shiny 
silver decorations offend any­
body? Since when does the im­
age of a fat man in a red suit 
make people want to file a legal 
suit of their own? Since when do 
domestic trees upset anybody 
but extreme environmentalists?
Where were the animal rights 
activists on Thanksgiving when 
turkey images were plastered 
around campus? When red 
hearts pop up everywhere in 
February, will there be com­
plaints because Valentine hap­
pened to be a Saint?
The University‘s decorations 
don’t infringe on anyone’s reli­
gious freedom, and they don’t 
carry any offensive political or 
religious messages. Nobody wor­
ships Santa, tinsel, or trees. 
Their only purpose is to bring 
about a festive mood. Hundreds 
of business owners seem to feel 
the same way. If Santa offends 
you, better not go shopping for a 
while.
Of course, turning religious 
holidays into marketing oppor­
tunities may rightly be consid­
ered offensive. But more offen­
sive is turning harmless tinsel 
into offensive propaganda. This 
bickering over a non-issue is 
best left to politics not educa­
tion.

The administration’s committee cre­
ated to review the censored Internet 
bulletin boards now has censored its 
own members.
At the December 1 meeting, a major­
ity of the committee, prompted by the 
chair, voted to gag its members from 
releasing information about what the 
committee discusses.
This gag order is 
alarming, for the group 
of people who suppos­
edly represent the cam­
pus community’s con­
cern about access to in­
formation have now 
made detailed informa­
tion about their discus­
sions unavailable to the 
community.
The gag order was levied because 
Jackie Koscelnik, the University’s at­
torney, refused to speak unless it was 
off-the-record. She said she was afraid 
her comments might implicate the Uni­
versity — a fear that is unfounded, ac­
cording to lawyers specializing in online 
liabilities.
However, the committee not only cen­
sored her comments, but stopped com­
mittee members from discussing the 
remainder of the meeting. This violated 
the committee’s original policy, decided 
during the first meeting, to allow full 
disclosure of discussions.
President Robert Mehrabian created 
the bboard review committee last month 
after students, faculty, and staff pro­
tested the administration’s decision to 
censor almost 100 Internet bboards con­
taining sex-related material. The 
committee’s voting members include two 
representatives each from Staff Coun­
cil, Faculty Senate, and Student Gov­
ernment, and the committee is chaired 
by Vice-Provost Erwin Steinberg, who 
has defended the current censorship 
policy to the press.
can access the banned bboards by using 
special software and connecting to other 
schools’ collections of the banned alt.bi- 
naries.pictures.erotica Internet bboards, 
the current policy isn’t censorship.
He’s wrong. Take TV broadcasts of 
movies, for instance. When a TV station 
bleeps out certain obscene words from a 
movie, it’s still censorship even though 
you can rent the movie from a video 
store.
Steinberg’s refusal to admit that the 
bboard ban is censorship shows in the 
way he runs committee meetings. One of 
the items he placed on the agenda — 
without the consent of committee mem-
According to Steinberg, since students
The group of people who supposedly rep­
resent the campus community’s concern 
about access to information have made 
detailed information about their discus­
sions unavailable to the community.
bers — was, “Is there no difference be­
tween Joyce’s Ulysses and D.H. 
Lawrence’s Lady Chatterly’s Lover on 
the one hand and the alt.binaries pic­
tures on the other?”
Is there a difference? Sure — the nov­
els are composed of text and the 
alt.binaries.* trees carry images. But 
the danger of making this analogy is 
that the administration’s censors are 
trying to judge the quality of the mes­
sages posted to the Internet. Okay, a lot 
of the images on the banned bboards are 
poorly-photographed. But if the censors 
don’t like the alt.binaries.* tree because 
of the quality of the photography, what’s 
to stop them from banning grammati­
cally poor discussions of Ulysses on 
netnews.bit.listserv.literary?
Steinberg has confused the issue fur­
ther with another agenda item that read, 
“If posting posters or calendars of scant­
ily clad women is considered ‘sexual 
harassment’ or creating a ‘chilly climate,’ 
how will a picture of a bound woman 
being raped by a ski pole be considered?” 
To dramatize his point, he passed around 
a green folder with that image in it, 
allegedly taken from one of the banned
bboards.
His argument, essentially that CMU 
should ban the bboards because images 
on them can be used to harass women, is 
misleading and deceptive. Carnegie 
Mellon University already has a policy 
in place prohibiting sexual harassment 
(“Sexual harassment could be, but is not 
limited to... displaying sexually explicit 
pictures or other materials” in a work 
environment.) If a male administrator 
stood in an office and quoted passages of 
Ulysses discussing penis lengths to a 
female co-worker, that could be harass­
ment. But is that a reason to ban Ulysses 
from the library? Is that a reason to ban 
collections of porno­
graphic artwork?
Because the commit­
tee is becoming side­
tracked by irrelevant 
issues like this one, it 
might take months to 
reach a final decision. 
For that reason, the 
members must con- 
sider the Faculty Sen­
ate and Staff Council resolutions and 
bring back the censored bboards until 
the committee can investigate the issue 
in detail.
The original decision to ban the 
bboards was made in haste, in a single 
closed meeting of the Academic Council, 
without adequate legal advice, and at 
the insistence of Bill Arms, the same 
Computing Services vice president who 
went before the Human Relations Com­
mission last year and tried to get the 
bboards banned. There is no legal, moral, 
or academic reason to keep the ban.
The committee should not uphold the 
administration’s original arbitrary and 
flawed decision. It should reverse the 
ban and resist the urge to censor.

dent, is one of the two student members of 
the Bulletin Board Committee. More de­
tailed information about the committee i

The Editor’s Notebook
Editor’s Notebook presents the individual opinion of the 
author only, not necessarily the opinions of The Tartan or of 
the Editorial Board.
Last week, I decided it would be cool if I could watch a movie 
with some friends in Doherty Hall 2210. Here is my story of 
dealing with the University. Last Monday, I went to the 
Registrar’s Office to try to reserve a room. I left a message 
with the receptionist (first university person). Later that 
evening, I had a message on my machine saying, “What did 
you want this for?” and “Who are you?”
So Tuesday afternoon, I called the Registrar and spoke with 
the woman in charge of room reservations (second university 
person). I said I wanted to reserve DH 2210 for myself and a 
bunch of friends to watch a movie. She seemed a little 
confused that a student would want to reserve a room and 
said that only student organizations, faculty, and staff could 
reserve rooms. She said I would have to talk to Student 
Activities. I asked if someone from Student Affairs would be 
fine, since I know Student Activities is usually pretty busy.
She said okay.
The receptionist at Student Affairs (third university per­
son) sent me back to talk with an Assistant to the Dean. I s 
spoke with him (fourth university person) for a while and he 
expressed amazement that I was having so much difficulty. 
However, he was not sure if he was allowed to reserve a room 
and said I should talk to Student Activities.
So I walked down to Student Activities and talked to one of 
the folks down there (fifth university person). She was able to 
set up a meeting for me with Dean Witchner later in the day. 
While waiting to meet with Dean Witchner, I walked over to 
Instructional Technology (IT) to find out about the VCR in DH 
2210.
At the front desk, I was directed by the receptionist (sixth 
university person) to the equipment room. There, I was 
greeted by a friendly IT person (seventh university person) 
who asked me what I needed. I told him and he asked me what 
organization I was with. I said just me and a couple of friends.
He said he wasn’t sure whether I could use the VCR, and got 
his supervisor (eighth university person). This supervisor 
was the most antagonistic person I had to deal with on my 
entire trip.
I was told that students could not use IT equipment, except 
for the carrols in the library; IT equipment was only f°r 
instructional purposes, not recreational purposes; and even if

After a recent column questioning com­
mon pediatric medical practices, I re­
ceived a berating email message: “If you 
have concerns about a vaccine, tell your 
doctor and let him decide. After all, he is 
the expert.”
Looking to “experts” for answers is a 
common crutch for most people. In this 
case, the pediatrician allegedly knows 
everything, while we as new parents 
know nothing. This doctor, however, did 
not know that while children continue to 
catch polio from the vaccine, no one in 
the Western Hemisphere has contracted 
polio, naturally, in years, and there has 
not been a case of wild polio in the 
United States for 15 years. He did not 
mention that children who died less than 
24 hours after receiving a set of vaccines 
are generally put down as cases of sud­
den infant death syndrome (SIDS), de­
spite protestations of parents and oth­
ers. He never considered that vaccines 
might have less than perfect efficacy,
although, for example, the New England 
Journal of Medicine reported that in states 
with comprehensive (K-12) immunization 
programs, 61-90 percent of measles cases 
occur in persons who were vaccinated.
Yet this is the expert into whose hands 
I am to blindly entrust the life of my 
daughter.
The point of my columns has never been
to force someone to hold a cer- ________
tain opinion. It is not possible to 
convey in a few thousand inked 
characters that vaccines de­
serve scrutiny, that abortion is 
more complicated than the 
rhetoric of “life,” that sentience 
is the only consistent basis for 
granting rights, or that consum­
ing the corpses of murdered ani­
mals is destructive, cruel, and -------------
immoral. ¦¦¦¦¦
Rather than being propaganda espous­
ing a particular world view, these essays 
are typed with the hope that people will 
question.
Let’s face it, many make money because 
most do not question the status quo. The 
drug makers and doctors get rich because 
people do not take responsibility for their 
own health through diet and exercise, but 
rather expect a pill, shot, cut, or tuck to
cure whatever ails them. The medical in­
dustry is Big Business based on people 
being sick.
The news is constantly filled with the 
latest medical breakthrough — research­
ers find genes that cause diabetes and 
breast cancer, cancer’s cure is right around 
the corner, heart disease is vanquished by 
oat bran, red wine, fish oils, etc.—but no

one has the guts to report the truth: that 
what we eat kills us. The “cures” to the 
diseases that will shorten most of our lives 
lie in what we choose to eat.
Dr. T. Colin Campbell of Cornell Univer­
sity has extensively studied the Chinese 
and found that the less flesh, eggs, and 
dairy they consumed, the lower their inci­
dence of heart disease, cancer, and other 
degenerative diseases of the West. There
was no threshold to this effect. Another 
study, of Seventh Day Adventists in the 
US, showed that those who followed a veg­
etarian diet lived five to seven years longer 
than their meat-eating counterparts. This 
year, the British Medical Journal reported 
that, after correcting for other risk factors, 
vegetarians were 40 percent less likely to 
die from all cancers. Yet, the researchers 
____________ vacillated on endorsing a veg­
etarian diet.
Why? In part because meat 
is an incredibly ingrained 
aspect of our culture, associ­
ated with affluence and 
abundance. This myth, in 
turn, is fed by the advertis­
ing budgets of those who 
make a handsome living

ging people’s arteries.
And we, on one dying end of this murder­
ous scheme, feed the cycle by turning our 
minds over to those with the glossiest pages, 
the fanciest titles, and the biggest words. 
In the end, we pay the price.

Imagine this scenario: You buy 
an appliance and decide to pay 
for it over the course of one year. 
You make a payment each month, 
but at the end of the twelve 
months, the company informs you 
that you have overpaid them and 
now you get a refund.
Of course, this doesn’t happen 
often — people aren’t willing to 
spend more money than they need 
to. Yet this form of money collec­
tion is still practiced in America 
on a very large scale. The culprit 
is the United States government, 
which withholds money from 
people’s paychecks, later realizes 
that people have overpaid, and 
gives them back a refund. This is
one drawback of our current tax 
system, and it could be remedied 
along with various other prob­
lems under a new taxation 
method.
The current tax system in this 
country is a graduated income 
tax, in which people who have 
more income have to pay a 
higher percentage of taxes. 
“Income” is not limited to 
personal earnings from a job; 
it includes other revenue, 
such as dividends and sale of 
stock. Under this system, 
there exists a great incentive 
to either under-report earn­
ings or “shelter” money in
incomes.
These problems have prompted 
two new ideas for taxation, both 
of which have been discussed in 
recent weeks. One proposal in­
volves a consumption tax that 
would basically tax as you spend.
argue that higher-priced items 
should be taxed more. (This 
sounds a lot like the luxury tax 
that was imposed several years 
ago, and ended up being a miser­
able failure.)
Another problem with a con-

graduated income tax also acts ,tax say that it would encourage 
as a disincentive for investment people to save money. Opponents 
by penalizing those with higher say that the tax is regressive, and
sumption tax, especially a VAT, 
is that it’s hidden from the con­
sumer. We have no way of seeing 
exactly how much of the money 
being spent is going to the gov­
ernment.
Another proposal is a flat tax. 
Representative Dick Armey of 
Texas has proposed that the cur­
rent system be scrapped and re­
placed with a true flat income 
tax. Every working person in 
America would pay the same per-
— centage of their income to 
the government. Obviously, 
people with higher incomes 
will have to pay more than 
people with lower incomes. 
There would be no yearly 
tax form, like the current 
one due on April 15. Instead, 
every month people would 
fill out a form and pay their
— taxes; the proposed tax form 
is about 10 lines long, and
about the size of the postcard.
Armey’s idea would result in 
great simplification. People would 
pay taxes just on the money they 
earned by working. They would

East End Tutoring Program enlightens students, tutors

Two weeks into the semester I real­
ized that I needed to drop one of my 
classes, but somehow keep my number 
of units in a safe range. I began scouring 
the course catalogue for a feasible an­
swer. After almost finishing the book 
and exhausting all possibilities, I went 
past the CSW listings to the last item — 
Tutoring, Mentoring, and Role Model­
ing (99-200). I found out that I could 
earn six units just by tutoring once a 
week and going to class every other 
week. As a pass/fail course, it seemed too 
good to be true.
The truth is, it turned out to be even 
better. We had a choice of tutoring at the 
elementary, middle school, and high 
school levels. I chose high school, even
though it meant helping students with 
algebra rather than English, as I had 
hoped. I was nervous the first morning as 
we rode to Allderdice High School, but 
when we arrived I quickly relaxed. We 
were assigned to groups of four or five 
students in the classroom. They were work­
ing on problems from 
their textbook, and many 
needed our help. They 
were quick to ask ques­
tions and by the end of 
the period one student 
asked me if I wanted to be i 
a teacher. When I asked why, he responded 
that I should be one because I really helped 
him understand the problems. That mo­
ment was one of the greatest feelings I 
have ever experienced.
In addition to the fulfillment of helping 
someone learn a concept, there were the 
friendships we developed with the stu­
dents themselves. One student in particu­
lar, Mike, really caught my attention. Af-
ter we finished the problems he began to 
ask me all kinds of questions about CMU 
and college in general. He had a sense of 
humor that immediately warmed up the 
conversation, and asked extremely bright 
and intelligent questions. The first two 
things he asked me were “What colleges

did you want to go to?” and — I still laugh 
about this one — “Do y’all run around 
without your panties on?” (referring to my 
sorority). Since then, I have always gone 
out of my way to work with Mike, though 
I do enjoy helping the other students as 
well.
The East End Tutoring Program (so 
named because tutoring is carried out in 
east-side schools in Pittsburgh) has really
made me open my eyes to what goes on in 
the local schools, and the needs of the stu­
dents there. As well as getting to know the 
students, I have begun to understand the 
problems these kids face every day of their 
lives. Because the program includes train­
ing and education for us as well, I was 
brought out of my shel­
tered little world to real­
ize that even in what ap­
pears to be a safe school, 
gangs and violence are
______________ very real. With security
guards walking the halls 
and the threat of past disturbances still in 
the air, it’s hard to ignore the tension among 
the students and the administration.
Not only have I learned a great deal about 
the kids and their lives through this pro­
gram, I have also come to many realiza­
tions about myself. The most important 
aspect I received from tutoring is the dis­
covery of what I have known most of my life,

but refused to admit. I have always pushed 
myself toward the money-making ambition, and 
that isn’t a bad thing, but the project has made 
me realize that I have always been happiest 
helping others, especially kids. For myself, the 
quick million isn’t a realistic lifelong goal — not 
that I’d mind, of course! But teachinghas always
struck a chord within me and I can no longer 
ignore it.
The East End Tutoring Program helped me 
realize that teaching, when done with enthusi­
asm and devotion, can be just as fulfilling—if not 
more so — than a high-profile corporate job.

TAXATION, from page 7
not have to pay for items such as 
dividends that have already been 
taxed at other levels. This would 
eliminate the double-taxing of 
items in our economy. Also, the 
only deduction would be a stan­
dard one, based on the size of 
one’s family, so that people 
wouldn’t be penalized for having 
children.
The main argument with 
Armey’s proposal is that it would 
almost definitely cause revenues 
to fall if the percentage were set
at a rate similar to our current 
one. But a revenue reduction may 
finally force our government to 
cut back on needless spending. 
Taxes would probably increase 
for some people under a flat tax, 
but for the majority, taxes would 
stay the same or decrease. Fi­
nally, with the elimination of 
withholding tax, people might 
start holding our government ac­
countable for the personal checks 
they’d be sending to the IRS ev­
ery month.
The current system of income
taxation in this country discour­
ages risk-taking among investors 
who create jobs, encourages 
cheating on taxes, and penalizes 
people for being successful.
The flat tax proposal eliminates 
these problems, and it makes 
sense. Representative Armey’s 
proposal is a sound one, and it 
should receive serious consider­
ation.

Bureaucracy proves ineffective
BUREAUCRACY, from page 6
I could use the equipment, it 
would cost me $50. Keep in mind
I only wanted a cabinet unlocked 
in DH 2210 — the equipment is 
ready to use. I do not think $50 is 
worth getting someone to unlock 
the cabinet.
So then I asked the supervisor 
if a dean could reserve the equip­
ment and I was asked, “Why 
would a dean want to do some­
thing like that?” I decided DH 
2210 was a lost cause so I asked 
about the media classroom next 
door. I was told, “That classroom 
is only for staff meeting and for 
classes.” I declined to tell the su­
pervisor about the time I had a 
staff meeting where the staff 
member showed his copy of an 
episode of Star Trek: The Next
Generation. So I thanked the su­
pervisor and left.
I then cancelled my appoint­
ment with Dean Witchner. I also 
called the Registrar’s office and 
left a message with one other 
person (ninth university person) 
and said that I would not need 
the room. There is no point in 
reserving a room if I can’t get the 
VCR.
What other alternatives were 
there? Well, I could have reserved 
a TV in a residence hall and pos­
sibly gotten a VCR from SDC, but 
I’m not a resident, and I don’t 
really want to watch a movie in a 
residence hall. And I could have 
really raised a big stink, instead 
of trying to be polite. It seems 
that when dealing with the ad­
ministration, being mean can
usually get you farther than be­
ing nice.
The people I spoke with at Stu­
dent Activities and at Student 
Affairs said what happened was 
ridiculous, and they said they 
would work on a place where com­
muter students could do things 
like watch movies. The folks at 
Student Activités and Student 
Affairs were very friendly and 
helpful.
The University pisses me off 
sometimes, and last week was a 
pretty good example. I guess I 
should be happy because the 
University is preparing me to deal 
with all sorts of asinine bureau­
cracies when I leave. Ah, well.... 
Maybe I can watch a movie an­
other day.

The Carnegie Mellon men’s basket­
ball team had a very successful two 
weeks, as they went 3—2 to improve to 5-
2 on the season (1—1 in the UAA). In­
cluded in that stretch were two big wins 
this past weekend, as the Tartans de­
feated UAA rival Emory 75-67 Friday 
night and Dickinson College 75-64 on 
Saturday night. The two losses suffered 
by the team were close contests which 
could have been won by either team.
12 points and senior guard Steve 
Athanas with 10 points. Junior forward 
Jon Blanciak had a double-double with 
12 points and 14 rebounds.
In the overtime loss to Alma in the 
first round of the Thanksgiving Classic, 
the leading scorer and rebounder was 
Blanciak. He had 22 points and a season 
high 22 rebounds in recording his sec­
ond double-double in as many games. 
Athanas and Bodnar gave solid perfor­
mances also. Athanas scored 21 points 
on 10 of 16 shooting, and dished out six 
assists. Bodnar scored 19 points and

They were defeated by Case Western 
Reserve 83-78 on November 22 and lost 
to Alma College 91-89 in overtime on 
November 26. Since those two losses, 
the Tartans have gone 3-0, with their 
other win coming last Sunday against 
SUNY-Oswego, 88-80.
In the loss to Case Western, the lead­
ing scorer was junior forward Kevin 
Byrne. Byrne scored 18 points in the 
contest. Also scoring in double figures 
were sophomore guard Rich Bodnar with
hauled in 11 rebounds. The Tartans out 
rebounded Alma 60-43, but it wasn’t 
enough to offset a poor shooting perfor­
mance. Alma shot 52 percent to the 
Tartans’ 37 percent.
In the consolation game of the Thanks­
giving Classic, CMU defeated SUNY- 
Oswego 88-80 to take third place. The 
leading scorers in this contest were Byrne 
and Bodnar. Byrne had 16 points and 19 
rebounds in picking up for Blanciak, 
who missed the game due to a mild ankle
sprain. Bodnar scored 16 points on 5 of 
10 shooting, and dished out five assists 
in leading the Tartans. Also scoring in 
double figures were junior guard Gregg 
Lassan with 15 points, junior forward 
Eric Ronzio with 10 points, and Athanas 
with 15 points. The Tartans out-re- 
bounded SUNY-Oswego 56-38, outshot 
them 44 percent to 42 percent, and at­
tempted a season high 51 free throws, 
making 31 of them.
On Friday night, the Tartans defeated 
UAA opponent Emory 75-67. Leading 
the team in scoring and assists was 
Athanas. Athanas scored 21 points on 7 
of 10 shooting, and handed out six as­
sists to lead the team. Also scoring in 
double figures was Bodnar who scored
17 points on 5 of 10 shooting, including 
three 3-pointers. Byrne registered a 
double-double with 15 points and 19 
rebounds. The Tartans out rebounded 
Emory 43-33, and shot 45 percent, while 
holding their opponent to 37 percent 
shooting.
“We had a very good run for the last 
five minutes of the first half, and then 
we let them back in the game early in the 
second,” said head coach Tony Wingen of 
his team’s performance. In the second 
half the Tartans made only 17 out of 
their 29 free throw attempts.
“We had a good stretch from about the 
eight minute mark to the three minute 
mark at the end where we extended the 
lead to 12 or 14 points,” said Wingen on 
the poor free-throw shooting. “Then we 
ended up missing 9 out of our last 14 free 
throws, which, if you’re trying to extend 
a lead and win a game, you’ve got to 
make your free throws.”
In Saturday night’s 75-64 win over 
the Dickinson College Red Devils, the 
Tartans played what seemed to be the 
best defense they have played all sea­
son. The leading scorer in the game was 
Bodnar with 22 points on 9 of 15 shoot­
ing.
“I thought Richy played really well,” 
said Blanciak on the performance of his 
teammate. “He is starting to hit his 
shots.” Registering double-doubles were
Blanciak and Byrne. Blanciak had 16 
points and 11 rebounds, while Byrne 
had 13 points and 12 rebounds. Also 
scoring in double figures for the Tartans 
was Lassan, who scored 10 points off the 
bench. Athanas handed out a season- 
high 11 assists, in leading the team’s

offense throughout the game.
“Steve had another good night tonight. 
Eleven assists is tremendous, and his 
performances continue to be outstand­
ing,” said Wingen about the 5'11" point 
guard. The Tartans out-rebounded 
Dickinson 44—35, as they continue to 
dominate their opponents on the boards.
“We are continuing to rebound well,” 
said Wingen. “We are double figures in 
rebounding advantage on the season, 
and that’s terrific.”
The Tartans also forced 23 turnovers, 
a sign of their improving defense. “That’s 
a lot, and that is a goal of ours: to force 20 
turnovers a game,” said Wingen.
“Defense picked up tonight. We’ve not 
been playing so well defensively. Today, 
it was better,” said Blanciak about the
team’s defensive effort. The Tartans shot 
only 41 percent from the field, but took 
19 more shots than the Red Devils, who 
shot 45 percent.
“This was as close to a full game of 
good team defense that we have played 
all year,” said Wingen. The Tartans also 
made 79 percent of their 
free throws compared 
with Dickinson’s 65 per­
cent. “The upside to­
night was that we made 
our free throws, but if 
we are going to compete 
well in the UAA, we’ve 
got to be able to handle 
things down the stretch 
better than we have the 
last couple of games,” 
said Wingen on turn­
overs made late in the 
game.
The Tartans have two 
more games remaining 
before the Christmas 
break. They are away 
against Juniata College 
on December 8 and at 
home against LaRoche 
C ollege on D ecember 11. 
“We’re real happy with 
two wins over the week­
end. We’ve got to keep 
improving everyday, and hopefully we 
will go 7-2 at the break,” said team 
captain Athanas about the team’s sta­
tus.
The Tartans, who were picked to fin­
ish near the bottom of the UAA, are 
slowly trying to prove the rankings 
wrong.
“We’re 5-2, but we’re not playing the 
best ball we can yet. I think we are going 
to sneak up on some people,” said Bodnar.
“We’re making little steps and little 
progresses everyday. We’re 5-2 right 
now, with two games that we can win 
remaining. I am real pleased with our 
position,” commented Wingen on his 
team’s overall performance this season.
The Tartans return to action Thurs­
day at Juniata College.

and a champion- 
ship at the 
Marietta Tour­
nament.
The women 
first traveled to 
Cleveland to 
face Case West­
ern Reserve 
University in 
their first UAA 
matchup of the 
year. They kept 
the score close 
through the first 
half, going to the 
locker room tied 
30-30. How­
ever, CWRU 
pulled away in 
the second half 
to win by a 65-52 margin. “We 
had an up and down game,” said 
head coach Gerri Seidl. “Turn­
overs really hurt us in the second 
half.”
Freshman Katie O’Leary scored
The Carnegie Mellon women’s 
basketball team has seen a lot of
action over the past two weeks. _________„ _ .
They played five games, compil- a game high 18 points while puli­
ng a 2-3 record to give them a 3- ing in 12 rebounds. Other high- 
4 record overall. Their matchups lights for the Tartans included 
have featured two University seniorJennyGretzwithl2points 
Athletic Association matchups and sophomore Rebecca Mc­
Cadney with nine rebounds.
The Tartans next traveled to 
Marietta for a tournament dur­
ing Thanksgiving break, and 
came away with the champion­
ship.
The women faced Denison in 
their opening round matchup. 
Denison jumped out to an early 
lead, but the Tartans kept it close 
throughout the game. They man­
aged to pull ahead with about 
two minutes left to go on to vic­
tory. Gretz led the Tartans with a 
career high 25 points while 
Kristen Kupfer added 14 points 
and O’Leary and McCadney 
teamed up for 17 rebounds.
Hannover was the Tartans op­
ponent in the championship 
game. The Tartans started off 
very well and took a 24-12 lead 
into half-time. From that point 
the teams played even and 
Carnegie Mellon took home the 
championship with a 59—49 vic­
tory. Gretz again led the Tartans 
with a game high 21 points. 
Sophomore Kristen Kupfer added 
18 points and pulled in 16 re­
bounds.
“Winning this tournament was
very good for us,” said Seidl. “We 
played very well defensively and 
that helped us.” The Tartans held 
Denison to a 32 percent field goal 
percentage and allowed Hann­
over a meager 
31 percent 
from the floor.
Gretz and 
Kupfer were 
named to the 
all-tourna­
ment team, 
and Gretz was 
named the 
tournament 
most valuable 
player. As a re­
sult of Gretz’s 
performance 
in the tourna­
ment and the 
previous game 
at Case West­
ern she was 
named UAA 
Player of the 
Week. She av­
eraged 19.3 
points per 
game during 
these three
games. Seidl praised Gretz in 
saying, “Jenny plays a great 
game. She is a real team leader 
and plays all aspects of the game.” 
The Tartans then came home

to face Waynesburg on Wednes­
day. Waynesburg brought a pow­
erful outside game with them as 
they shot at a 51 percent clip 
from the floor and at an amazing 
55 percent clip from behind the 
three-point arc. The Tartans 
weren’t able to keep up with the 
attack as Waynesburg pulled 
away for a 75-53 victory. Kupfer 
scored 26 points and grabbed 15 
rebounds in a losing effort.
The Tartans then faced their 
UAA rival Emory on Friday. The 
Tartans were able to keep the 
game close during the first half, 
but Emory used its fast transi­
tion game to pull away from the 
Tartans and win by a score of 73— 
50 and drop the Tartans’ UAA 
record to 0-2.
O’Leary led the Tartans with 
12 points and 13 rebounds. Kupfer 
added 11 points and nine re­
bounds. Gretz and sophomore 
Kelly Gaitens each added 10 
points.
The Tartans played William 
Smith College at Skibo Gym yes­
terday. Their next action is at the 
Ohio Northern University tour­
nament on December 29—30.

The Carnegie Mellon Men and 
/^omen’s Swimming team traveled to 
Baltimore last weekend to compete 
against Johns Hopkins and Gettysburg 
111 a meet that would decide some of the 
swimmers who would qualify for theNationals.
The women’s team swam well accord- 
jjjgtohead coach Jim Cutrone, “although 
hey were a bit tired because of the 
rigorous training.”
Junior Rebecca Fruehan swam excep­
tionally by getting second place in the200-yard individual medley and the 100-
yard freestyle event, and first place in
the 200-yard freestyle event. Her times 
for these events were recorded as provi-
“Training has been incredible, 
and this is the most dedicated 
team I have ever coached. ”
— Jim Cutrone, swim coach
sional national qualifying times.
Sophomore Christina Hagopian and 
freshman Carly Cenedella also gave fine 
performances in the 500-yard freestyle
event and another prime performance 
came from senior Sarah Broadley who
________________ swam a 400-yard
freestyle relay split 
of 57.00 seconds.
Even though 
Carnegie Mellon 
placed third in this 
event with Johns 
Hopkins on top and 
Gettysburg second, 
Cutrone said he was 
“very pleased with 
our fall season. 
Training has been incredible, and this is 
the most dedicated team I have ever 
coached.... I look for the commitment to 
swimming fast to continue until Febru­
ary. It is a long six-month season.”
The men’s team performance was ex­
cellent according to Cutrone, they had 
their fastest time of the year for the 400- 
yard medley relay (3:43.15 minutes), 
the 400-yard freestyle relay (3:17.08 min­
utes), and the 200-yard freestyle relay 
(1:29.43 minutes).
These three events were a combined 
effort by freshman Jake McGuire, junior 
Matthew Moe, junior Geoff Waller, jun­
ior Mike Berty, freshman Mike Foster, 
and sophomore Chris O’Rourke.
Jeff Milton had an exceptional meet, 
performing excellently in the 200, 500, 
and 1,650-yard events.
Geoff Waller placed second in both the 
400-yard individual medley and the 200-
yard butterfly.
The team’s next meet is the Univer­
sity of Pittsburgh Team Classic, which 
takes place on Saturday.
The team travels to Florida from De­
cember 28-January 12 to train. While in 
Florida, they will swim in the Hall of 
Fame Classic at Fort Lauderdale on 
New Year’s Eve.
On January 11, they will swim against 
UAA foe New York University, also in 
Fort Lauderdale.
On January 13, the team hosts the 
University of Rochester and hosts Hiram 
College and Mount Union College the 
following day.
UAA championships are February 16-
18 at Emory University.

Quarterback Sneak 
By John Weber
This is the last printing of the Tartan 
in 1994, so it’s time to start thinking 
playoffs. In fact, we won’t be back until 
January, so I’ll tell you now who’s going 
to be playing in the NFC and AFC cham­
pionship games.
Let’s start with the NFC, because that’s 
easy. The Dallas Cowboys and the San 
Francisco 49ers will meet in Candle­
stick Park for the NFC Championship. 
There is almost no doubt that these two 
teams are destined to meet again, and I 
don’t think anyone is going to be able to 
stop them. As far as the Super Bowl 
goes, everyone knows that the Cowboys 
have the ability to win their third, but 
four obstacles stand in their way. First 
and most important: injuries. Emmitt 
Smith and Troy Aikman top the list of 
injured warriors. If Smith is unable to
play in any playoff game, the Cowboys 
will lose. If Aikman is unable to play in 
any playoff game, the Cowboys chances 
of advancing are slim. Along with 
Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper, these 
two are essential to the Cowboys’ suc­
cessful offensive attack. Second, the Cow­
boys venture into the playoffs without 
Jimmy Johnson. Now is 
the time when well find 
out what kind of coach 
Barry Switzer is. Third, 
the Cowboys must try to 
do something that hasn’t 
been done by any team in 
history, win three Super 
Bowls in a row. Finally, 
the Cowboys must get 
past the 49ers for the third consecutive 
year.
The third time’s a charm, and this 
could very well be the year for the 49ers. 
By beating the Cowboys in the regular 
season, the 49ers have the opportunity 
to win home field advantage throughout 
the playoffs. The offense speaks for it­
self, but there are still some question 
marks on defense. Deion Sanders has 
helped, but the defense has still not 
elevated itself to the next level. Oppo­
nents can still push the 49er defense 
around, demonstrated so well by the
Rams in their comeback attempt a few 
weeks ago. Unlike the Cowboys, how­
ever, the 49ers don’t have many inju­
ries, and their banged up offensive line 
is beginning to come back together. (Be­
lieve me, they’ll need it against the Cow­
boys’ front four.)
The NFC playoffs should still be inter-
This year I’m predicting the downest 
and dirtiest [AFC] Championship 
game in a long, long time: the 
Browns and the Steelers.
esting, even if no one seems to be able to 
match up against the Cowboys or 49ers. 
The Eagles have made vast improve­
ments this year on both sides of the ball, 
but they can’t win the big games. The 
Vikings have an incredible defensive 
line, but Warren Moon has not been able 
to deliver a consistent offensive attack 
yet. If the Packers could clone Reggie 
White, they wouldbe Super Bowl bound, 
but they can’t, so they won’t. And as for 
the Cardinals, Bears, and Falcons, they 
may make the playoffs, but if they do, 
they will be on the road in uphill battles.
The AFC playoff picture, as usual, is 
not so cut and dry. This year I’m predict­
ing the downest and dirtiest Champion­
ship game in a long, long time: the 
Browns and the Steelers; two teams 
with incredible defenses and just enough 
offense to get them there. Sure, it isn’t 
going to be easy, but it could very well 
happen. Both teams are 
very much alike. Both have 
incredible defenses, two av­
erage quarterbacks, and a 
punishing running game. 
One of the two teams, how­
ever, to make this champi­
onship game come true, 
cccccca will be a wildcard team and 
will have to win on the road 
at least once, probably in San Diego or 
Miami.
In the East, the Dolphins have the 
upper hand, and then some. Defensively, 
the Dolphins have the usual concerns 
going into the playoffs, but hey, at least 
Marino’s healthy. The Bills are not go­
ing to go to their fifth consecutive Super 
Bowl. The Bills offense is still effective, 
but opponents have learned to contain 
Bruce Smith and attack the Bills de­
fense.
Finally, in the East, we have the in­
consistent Jets and Patriots. (The Pats
also lack a solid defense.) Either team 
could sneak into the playoffs, but not 
very far.
In the West we have the incredible 
story of the San Diego Chargers. They 
have beaten the Chiefs twice, in essence, 
winning the West. The Chargers also 
have a very solid defense built around 
Junior Seau. In addition, they have what 
the Steelers and Browns do not — an 
effective offensive attack both on the 
ground and through the air. Stan 
Humphries provides the air attack while 
Natrone Means provides the ground 
game.
As long as Humphries stays healthy, 
the Chargers chances in the playoffs are 
very good. However, since I don’t expect 
the Chargers to be in the championship 
game, you can guess what I think of 
Humpries’ chances to remain uninjured 
the rest of the season.
The Chiefs are down but not out. Mon­
tana may not have the magic going right 
now, but the playoffs always seem to be 
a different story. The defense is still 
centered aroundNeil Smith and Derrick 
Thomas, who have been slowed down by 
Chief opponents recently.

ing major.

As the college football season 
winds down, the debate begins to 
heat up: Who’s number one? In 
a season where voters in the As­
sociated Press writers’ poll and 
theUSAToday/CNN coaches’ poll 
have penalized number one teams 
for not winning impressively 
enough, no one can be sure ex­
actly how the voters will vote on 
January 3rd. There are two un­
defeated teams and a once-beaten 
staking their pre-bowl claims to 
the title. Unbeaten and current 
consensus number one Nebraska 
will play third-ranked and 10-1 
Miami in the Orange Bowl, while 
number two Penn State puts its 
unblemished record on the line 
against Oregon in the Rose Bowl. 
Will an impressive Penn State 
win in the Rose combined with a 
lackluster Nebraska victory over 
Miami in the Orange Bowl leap­
frog the Nittany Lions back over 
the Comhuskers in the final polls? 
Will Miami have a legitimate 
claim to the title if they beat Ne­
braska and Penn State has
trouble with Oregon in the Rose 
Bowl? Let’s take a look at each of 
the top national contenders and
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art
their chances for the national 
championship, in order of their 
current ranking.
Nebraska: win the Orange
Bowl. A victory over Miami at the 
Hurricanes’ home stadium will 
be good enough for Tom Osborne 
to bring home his first 
national championship. 
A strong defense and the 
number one-rated rush­
ing offense in the country 
have helped to compen­
sate for the loss of 
Heisman trophy candi­
date and starting quar­
terback Tommy Frazier, 
who went out early in the 
season with a recurring 
blood clot in his right leg. 
Frazier dressed for 
Nebraska’s season-end­
ing victory over Okla­
homa and may split time 
with Brook Berringer 
New Year’s night. Os­
borne has suffered sev­
eral hearbreaking de­
feats at the Orange Bowl, 
including the last-second 
loss to Florida State this 
.o-Editor past January \ and the 
31-30 loss to Miami at the end of 
the 1983 season, both of which 
kept the Huskers from winning 
national championships.
Penn State: beat Oregon in the 
Rose Bowl and hope for a Ne­
braska loss. No matter what any­
one says, Joe Paterno’s Nittany 
Lions will not win the national 
championship without help from 
Miami. The “Nits actually dropped 
from the number one spot in the 
AP poll after a 49-point win over 
then-16th-ranked Ohio State 
when Nebraska beat Colorado. 
One of the most prolific offenses 
in recent college football history 
is led by quarterback Kerry 
Collins and running back Ki-Jana 
Carter, who will both finish in 
the top five in voting for the 
Heisman Trophy. However, vot­
ers question the strength of the 
Lions’ banged-up defense, which 
has given up over 30 points in two 
of its last three games. Penn State 
must also fight the coaches who 
vote in the USA Today/CNN poll, 
many of whom have stated they 
would like to see Osborne win his
first championship. A Nebraska 
tie and a Penn State win would 
also give Paterno his" first title 
since 1986.
Miami: win in the Orange Bowl 
and pray for an earthquake. The 
least likely of the three national 
championship contenders, the 
Hurricanes likely blew their title 
hopes in one quarter in late Sep­
tember. That period saw Wash­
ington score 25 points, erasing an
11-point Miami lead on the way 
to a 38-20 victory which also 
ended the ‘Canes national record 
of 58 consecutive home victories. 
The nation’s number one scoring 
and yardage defense is led by 
junior tackle Warren Sapp, who 
last week won the Lombardi Tro­
phy, which is annually awarded 
to the country’s outstanding line­
man. Quarterback Frank Costa 
proved he can win a big game 
when Miami spanked Florida 
State 34r-20 in October, but still
makes too many bad decisions. If 
the Hurricanes win, they will still 
need one of the biggest major 
bowl upsets of all time by the 
Ducks in the Rose to have a 
chance, even if Hurricanes’ play­
ers and coaches seem to feel an 
Orange Bowl triumph should give 
them at least a share of the title.
Regardless of who wins the na­
tional title, the question of 
whether or not there should be a 
national playoff system has once 
again come to the forefront. As­
suming Penn State and Nebraska 
both win their bowl games, one 
(almost certainly Penn State) will 
not win the national crown, de­
spite going undefeated.
With two split polls in the last 
four years and the possibility of 
an unbeaten team in a'major con­
ference finishing second in the 
polls this season, perhaps it is 
time to seriously consider a play­
off system.

Back Porch Empire
by Troy Benowitz
My chubby hands position pre-cut balsa, 
cramped over my worktable on the back porch,
I push pieces together to form a fuselage, 
scrambling for Jet glue to dribble over the frame 
as Mom makes chicken soup inside, throwing whole carrots 
into a flowery white pot with a broken handle.
I study plans for the wings, the rudder,
the stabilizer, as glue dries, sharpen X-Acto blades,
look for ships through the torn screen,
admire the river, brisk late autumn winds forcing
the black water to make foam whitecaps at its surface.
I lay wax paper over the plans, pinning balsa strips 
to them, gluing balsa together as two wings materialize,
I give them depth, me two hands never enough,
always too much balsa, too much to glue, too much to cut.
I imagine the plane when it’s completed; blue tissue 
paper covering the balsa frame, rubber band engine 
and sleek plastic red propeller. I imagine it soaring, 
out over the river, over the shipping lane, more free 
than the ships that pass underneath it ever will be.
,s
The new house, “up the river,” as my grandmother put it,
miles from her pork pies and loud mouth,
rests on the shore of the St. Lawrence,
the only year-round home in a sea of camps,
their happy blue and pink pastel particle board walls
a contrast to our brown and beige abode.
I had insisted on colonizing the screened-in 
back porch for my ever-
expanding balsa model empire, begging my grandmother 
to donate her big cellar table only used annually 
for wrapping Christmas presents.
I set up my own private hobby shop, 
arranging my equipment perfectly, positioning 
everything within easy reach.
I even made a sign, reading, “Balsa Haus,” 
and wired it to the screen.
Mom supported my habit, buying
me endless glues, X-Acto blades, brushes,
paints, and balsa stick-and-tissue model airplane kits.
It was everything I’d ever need.
,­­
I finish the wings and gently sand away the excess glue, 
smoothing the surface enough to apply the tissue paper. 
Its getting cold, but I remain on my back porch 
in stocking feet and short-sleeved shirt 
determined to coat the wings in tissue paper 
before I indulge in chicken soup.
I apply the thick, clear adhesive to the balsa frame 
with a little brush. I cut out the tissue, using the pattern 
in the instructions. Carefully, I start to press the tissue 
onto the wings, cautious of any bubbles or gaps 
I may accidentally cause.

---------------------------------------------------

I glance inside through the storm 
window, Mom looks up and flashes a smile, 
causing me to look down at my wings, 
oddly embarrassed at feeling so close 
to her and so happy.
IV
I break for chicken soup, telling Mom 
the latest developments on the back porch.
She listens intently, pretending toe interested. 
Her mind is on other matters.
I can see it in her eyes, all spacey and glossy.
Her soup, as ever, is wonderful, despite 
the yogurt, wheat germ, and powdered vitamins 
and minerals she has undoubtedly added to it, 
as she does to all her cooking.
\
It is dusk when I prepare to coat the fuselage in tissue, 
being careful around its curvy bottom.
I touch the tissue to the coated balsa, turning the fuselage 
as fast as my hands can follow, pressing down 
only after all is positioned.
I can never do this part fast enough, my fat hands 
always working, somehow, in slow motion, my mind 
always working at double speed, tissue gets caught up 
inside, bubbles form, and it starts to rip.
I push in on the balsa, gently at first, then, upon 
seeing the blue tissue fumbling inside the balsa frame, 
harder, feeling balsa crunch between my fingers, 
feeling the meticulously-glued pieces snap in my hands.
I squeeze the mess in my hands, glue, balsa, and tissue 
wadding up into a ball of disaster before my eyes.
I eye the wings, dried, completed, but before I can resist, 
my fat fists come down on them, crushing them, 
destroying any chance they would have at being airborne, 
any chance they would have at sailing over the Lawrence.
\,
I watch “Family Ties” later that night with my Mom. 
Mallory's having boy troubles.
She’s asked two boys to the same dance 
and the choice is now driving her insane.
She’s part of a world she can’t control, 
a world alien to my little back porch empire, 
where, on a whim, I can smash everything 
and begin fresh in the morning, 
a world which really can’t refuse me, 
for I am its emperor.

On the Pulse of Mourning
by Phil Andrews
A Rock, A River, A Tree 
Under such things I buried thee.
Giants who left glittering tokens, prizes 
To be found and treasured; Gold with the Midas 
Touch, all covered :by the consuming gloom, 
Lost in an aged, dusty tomb
Cry out you may,
But we sealed you tight today 
Stamped the soil, to pack you down 
Stole your light, destroyed your crown.
Meter, Hhyme, Vocabulary,
ilitist tools, suppressor of the masses.
Deadly bones, maintainer of the classes.

The year 2000 is only five years and 26 days away; however, 
the year inspires expectations of great change in people. Given 
thatprediliction, pundits around the globe try to ®
be different at the turn of the century. I won t take *at^dfor 
two reasons: I think it’s stupid to try Mid predict what will be 
what and, if I am willing to wait those five years and 26 days I 
will know the answer without having had to.waste: anythoug^ 
on the matter. I do, however, have hope — hope that the CM 
student will be a different creature.
The phrase, “I’m so tired,” or “I have so much work to do, is the 
stock reply to the often-asked stock question, “How are you 
doing?”
Ererybody°s tired anl has a lot of work to do. Is it possible for 
us to talk about anything else? The second runner up it.conver­
sation amongst students is, “I hate the weather in ^sbur^.
That conversational ploy is as stimulating as watclnng hair 
grow We are college students. There has to be something more 
exciting going on than our sleep/work habits or the weather. And 
if there isn’t, something has to be done.
Students of the future need to learn to do one *ing-lie.Not

up something interesting about their lives. It may be a 
some, but it would really make college a more »wardmgexp* 
rience. Students have the built in capacity to he — just listen to
the things they tell their professors Hifff,rent
Students of the year 2000 could have a totally different 
memory of school than we do.
“Mike, how are you doing?” asks Sally. „p ,lv annA
Mike looks over his shoulder and then answers, Really good,

Mike tells her, ‘Well remember

Sally says, “Sure.”

The point is, if students want their college experience to l-

Old Man Donner
by Jason Roth
Clip, save, and laminate this one, folks: 
We’re ending the semester with a bang. 
I’ve made these recipes over the last two 
nights, and I haven’t eaten so well since 
Mother fired the cook. We’ll start off 
with a classic:
Chili
2 lbs ground beef
big can o’ kidney beans (32 oz)
2 big cans o’ whole tomatoes
1 onion, chopped
1/2 green pepper, chopped
1 can tomato paste
2 Tbs. chili powder
oregano, garlic, pepper
This one’s courtesy of fellow architect 
Rick Sabeh, and it’s a winner. Brown 
the beef, drain well, add the pepper and 
onion, fry it up a bit. While 
this goes on, chop up the 
tomatoes (they’re real 
mushy, so this is easy; but 
watch out, they spit), then 
add them, the paste (one of 
those little cans), and some 
salt & pepper. After 15 min- 
utes or so, add everything else, and sim­
mer the hell out of it.
Now, you can mince the garlic or use 
powder (guess which way I’m biased), 
and put it in, in addition to freshly 
ground black pepper, a red and black 
pepper mix. Add the tomato liquid, but 
not the bean liquid. Finally, the big 
issue in chili: spice.
This recipe is very mild; I used twice 
as much chili powder, half a jalapeno, 
and I’m a wuss. If you want any real bite 
at all, use at least 6 tablespoons of chili
powder and/or Mexican chili powder. 
Finally, a word of warning: this is a big 
recipe — at least two and half quarts of 
chili. Either invite a lot of friends, or 
make certain you’ve a big storage bowl.
Here’s something I just discovered: 
Jiffy mix in an 8" pie pan in a toastRoven 
set a little high and preheated.
... this here is a real meal from the 
days when a face shiny with oil was 
a sign of health and wealth.
The outside gets pretty dark (let it), 
while the inside remains moist and amaz­
ing.
From a New World classic to a Medi­
terranean tradition,
Greek Roast Chicken with 
Potatoes, or 
Kotopolou Fournou
Roasting chicken (2-3 lb)
2 lb potato, skinned and wedged 
1 large lemon 
oregano, pepper
4 Tbs. olive oil 
1/2 cup hot water 
21/2 sticks butter
Yes, you read that last ingredient right; 
stay away fat-weenies, this here is a real 
meal, from the days when a face shiny 
with oil was a sign of health and wealth.
Preheat the oven to 
425 and put the 
chicken breast down 
(upside down) in a 
large pan.
Add the potatoes,
______ sprinkle a fair amount
of spices about, pour 
on the oil, squeeze the lemon, and put 
the butter all over the place. Lastly, add 
the water in a corner of the pan and put 
it in the oven for 30 min. After this time, 
flip the bird, baste, and add a lot more 
spice (thyme is also appropriate). Go for 
about another hour, basting at least 
once, and it’s ready. This is so good it’s 
amazing — the potatoes roast in all 
these juices, acquiring great flavor. The 
contrast between butter and lemon is 
out of this world. Yow.
A good complement is a salad with
cucumber, tomato, onion, mushroj 
and feta (also mozzarella); try mal^’ 
your own vinaigrette, which is simply! 
lot of oil, some vinegar (either kj^ 
although red wine’s better), and van'o^ 
appropriate spices, all mixed up. ^ 
artichoke (boil or steam until tender) 
would go nicely, especially dipping^ 
leaves in the lemon butter.
That’s it for now. I guess I’ll be ba 
next semester, if only because I’vea{ 
least another two good recipes to p; 
on. Happy holidays, don’t get yourselve; 
killed, and, for God’s sake, get

Horror Stories
by Tom Harper
Well, my birthday was a couple Mon­
days ago. I turned an ominous 20. Now 
that I’m a full-fledged member of Gen­
eration X, the many people profiting 
soured also.
My birthday never really created a 
furor at my house mostly because of the 
fact that my 8-soon-to-be-9 year-old 
brother has his birthday eight days away 
from mine, and Christmas is less than a 
month away, so I always ended up get­
ers full of sweaters.
My birthday is also a 
subtle reminder for my 
mom to get all the 
Thanksgiving stuff in 
order.
Ah, Thanksgiving — 
what pleasant memories
— like when my mom 
grabbed me and my 
older brother by the 
hand and told us she 
wanted us to volunteer 
to do dishes.
Considering that dishes made up about 
40.3 percent of my and my brother’s 
home life, at the time we were more than 
reluctant to do so.
It’s a good thing my mom finally dis-

My birthday never really created a furor at my house 
... because of the fact that my 8-soon-to-be-9 year old 
brother has his birthday eight days from mine, and 
Christmas is less than a month away so I always end 
up getting “diluted" presents.
Immediately after doing so he bought 
a Chevy Beretta and stayed out until 3 
am. Well, it seems that nothing has 
changed that much....
Then, when I came back to school,

So if you see some pedestrains in that 
parking lot, you tell ’em to get the hell 
out of there.
Pedestrains are simply not allowed in 
there.
What also strikes me as odd is the
recent weather.
I’m accustomed to white-grounded 
birthdays and Thanksgivings, but this 
was one of the weirdest Novembers on 
record.
Despite our strange climate hereii 
Western Pennsylvania, we can almost 
always look forward to snow by my birth­
day. We had a light dusting the 23rd; but 
that’s it.
We did have a lot of wind, though..
So remember, keep those pedestrains 
out of the CFA parking lot. And if you 
want to, pray for snow, good Christmas 
presents, peace on Earth, good gr 
on finals, and maybe sanity in general. 
If you’re Generation X, pray for a 
job and all that.

With the first semester quickly 
coming to a close, preparations 
for this year’s Slice of Life confer­
ence are well underway. The con­
ference, sponsored by the Office 
of Alumni Relations in partner­
ship with the Career Center, will 
take place on Saturday, Febru­
ary 18,1995 from 10am to 4 pm at 
the Holiday Inn in Oakland.
Slice of Life, which is now in its 
sixth year, offers a chance for 
students to hear from alumni 
what life following Carnegie 
Mellon is like. Just a few of the 
topics featured in this year’s Slice 
of Life are: A Five-Step Process to 
Career-Decision Making, What 
Management Expects of Your
First Year on the Job, Money 
Management: Investing for Be­
ginners, Issues for Working 
Women;Yes,You Can (Assert­
iveness), and Dual Career 
Couples.
In addition to the various infor­
mation sessions, the keynote 
speaker will be 1966 College of 
Fine Arts graduate, Iris Dart. 
Dart is author of Beaches, and 
just finished writing a new novel 
titled Show Business Kills.
Slice of Life offers programs 
presented by a diverse group of 
alumni, which will appeal to the 
diversity of current students. 
While in the past Slice of Life was 
only open to seniors and juniors, 
this year’s program is open to the 
entire student body. The confer­
ence is completely free to attend,
with a complementary shuttle to 
get you to the Holiday Inn, plus 
complimentary breakfast and 
lunch.
Here are a few of the comments 
garnered from students who at­
tended last years Slice of Life: 
“Probably the best thing Carnegie 
Mellon has done forits students,” 
“This program truly surpassed 
my expectations,” “The present­
ers are amazing — they were all 
dynamic and realistic speakers,” 
and “This is a great program, and 
a valuable way to get in contact 
with alumni.”
Registration for this year’s Slice 
of Life will take place in front of 
Doherty Hall the week of Janu­
ary 16,1995. For more informa­
tion contact Shelley Brozenick at

Write-a-thon tries to aid prisoners
By SUSAN WATSON
Tartan Staffwriter
On Thursday, December 8, 
three Amnesty International 
groups from the Pittsburgh area 
will sponsor the Amnesty Write- 
A-Thon for Ten Prisoners of Con­
science. The organizations spon­
soring the write-a thon are Pitts­
burgh Group 39, South ---------
Hills Group 345 and 
Sewickley Group 524.
The Write-a-Thon will 
take place atthe Calvary 
Episcopal Church on 
Shady Street and Wal­
nut Street in Shadyside 
from 6:30-9:30 pm. Any­
one interested in human ______
rights is welcome to par- ¦¦¦¦ 
ticipate in the annual 
event.
The Write-a-Thon was started 
nine years ago to create an aware­
ness of worldwide human rights 
in the Pittsburgh area. “We want 
to acquaint a larger number of 
people with the observance of 
human rights,” said Geraldine 
Malmberg, a coordinator of the 
event. Malmberg feels there is a
need to create this awareness 
because human rights violations 
are escalating rapidly.
This year the letters will focus 
on the liberation of prisoners from 
China-Tibet, USA, Indonesia, 
Rwanda, Turkey, Pakistan, 
Burundi, and China. Each pris­
oner will have a brief history of 
his or her case which will be placed
"The Write-a-Thon ... will 
create an observance of 
human rights in the Pitts­
burgh area.”
— Geraldine Malmberg
on one of ten tables in the church. 
The Freedom Writers, the Write- 
a-Thon participants, will have the 
opportunity to read each of the 
prisoner’s accounts prior to writ­
ing their letters. Writers will then 
write a letter on behalf of the 
prisoner that they choose.
Based on the success of the past 
events, Malmberg feels the up
and coming Write-a-Thon will be 
beneficial to Amnesty Interna­
tional as well as the community. 
She said, “The Write-a-Thon will 
not only work towards freeing 
prisoners of conscience and end­
ing torture, but it will create an 
observance of human rights and 
human rights issues in the Pitts­
burgh area.”
Malmberg also hopes-to 
increase the membership 
of local Amnesty Inter­
national organizations. 
Over 2,000 people are af­
filiated with Amnesty In­
ternational groups, and 
200 people are active in 
community group work 
to stop human rights vio- 
¦¦BB lations.
Malmberg is also 
pleased with the growing num­
ber of Amnesty International or­
ganizations on local high school 
and college campuses.
If you have questions pertain­
ing to the Write-a-Thon, or if you 
are interested in joining Amnesty 
International, call Geraldine 
Malmberg or Bill Joyce at 731-

I y!cp jri; Drum roll, please! And the winner 
t'/ciis-— On the last day of each spring se- 
,o jester, Carnegie Mellon holds its own 
I ^version of the Oscars, complete with all 
If j ofthe excitement, pinache, and elegance: 
The Adamson Writing Awards. 
bL The Adamson Writing Awards are 
sponsored by the English Department, 
|c ,B(which leads most students to believe 
I? , /ithatthe awards are open only to English 
1/ Ttrfitudents. “I would like the campus com­
munity to see the awards for the whole 
[ community, for recognizing the... excel- 
fr ^'Jence of what is being done throughout 
b \ the community,” said Richard Young, 
\ Thomas S. Baker Professor of English 
[i ¡iuand Rhetoric. In 1981 and 1982, as the 
I yohead of the English Department, Young 
fe, \worked with Clarence Adamson to cre- 
| ,i\fate these awards to acknowledge 
p < ^achievement in writing across the entire 
l‘ p-campus.
f' Adamson’s wife, Pauline, diedin 1980. 
f /After this loss, Adamson wanted to cre- 
I .-.¡ate a permanent memorial for her, so he 
[ looked towards Carnegie Mellon, his 
alma mater (actually he graduated from 
¿fche Carnegie Institute of Technology in 
lfl915 with a degree in mechanical engi­
neering). Pauline was a mathematician, 
but she read constantly; Adamson 
panted to acknowledge this life-long pas- 
ujsion-0 £ Adamson was not sure how much 
money to give or what should be done 
; cjtfith it. “I made a dozen proposals,” said 
js ;n(Young. “We finally settled on the 
H u-Adamson Wing, which was a very ex­
pensive proposition.” Adamson also 
wanted to do something special to “af­
firm the value of all different kinds of 
Bf ¡¡¿vriting,” said Young. In addition to the 
Adamson Wing and the Adamson 
w JU£.wards, Adamson made one other dona- 
!£ ,bjjion to the English Department in the 
pR-iform of a scholarship to help selected 
^undergraduates finish their degrees in 
four years (as opposed to the eight years
it took his wife).
Each year the Adamson Awards are 
held in the Adamson Wing in Baker 
Hall, but “the Adamson Auditorium is 
no longer large enough,” said Young. 
Students fill the aisles and line up 
against the walls, but, the issue remains 
the same — the majority of these stu­
dents are English majors.
“We don’t want it to be perceived as an 
English Department thing,” said Jim 
Daniels, assistant professor of English. 
“We’re hoping the awards might be an 
impetus for other students to improve 
writing and consider submit­
ting.... The categories are pretty 
open.... We can accept most writ­
ing done on campus.” The only 
restriction: you have to be an 
enrolled student at Carnegie 
Mellon.
English students understand 
that these awards are open to all 
students, but many are quite 
possessive of them. “Speaking 
from experience, it is certainly 
true that creative writers would 
feel animosity towards a non- 
English major winning an award 
that is traditionally in their 
field,” said Micki Kochanskyj 
(English ’94), who walked away 
with two first-place awards last 
year for the first time in the 13 
year history of the Adamson 
Awards. “To say they consider 
the awards exclusively theirs is 
an understatement.”
Sharon Dilworth, assistant 
professor of English, sees the 
awards as a good learning experience for 
students, especially English students. 
“... [particularly] for creative writers, 
[the Adamson Awards are] a good lesson 
about how the world of writing works 
because, as a writer, you’re always en­
tering contests, ... grants,... and submit­
ting works.... This is probably the first 
contest students will enter.” Every stu­
dent who enters cannot win, and it’s 
good practice to compete with students
outside of the English department be­
cause that is the real world.
“The outcome of the Adamsons can be 
extremely disappointing,” said Broc 
Yusef Hamlin, a senior English major 
who won an award in Magazine Writing 
last year. “Last year, a bunch of seniors 
left the room with nothing but crushed 
hopes, a heartbreak, and fake smiles. 
Think about it. You’re a senior. You’re 
smug and wise in class, and you’re going 
to be a famous writer someday. Blah 
blah blah. Then along comes some non- 
English major or a talented — yet un­
Clarence Adamson donated over a million dollars to the 
University. IVIost of this money was given to the English 
Department in memory of his wife, Pauline, pictured above.
known—sophomore or junior, and they 
blow your stuff away. There’s no excuse 
because the judges don’t know who’s an 
English major, who’s a senior, or who’s 
Smelvin from Melvin. They just pick 
who they think is the shit.”
Daniels thinks that the Adamson 
Awards are especially “a good learning 
experience for those students who don’t
keep going and to keep writing.”
The one issue everybody agrees on is 
the ceremony itself. The presentation of 
awards always takes place on the last 
day of class in the spring semester. The 
air is filled with building nervousness 
and excitement until that day, for both 
the people who entered and the English 
department as a whole — and hopefully 
the entire campus community. Each year 
there are different judges for the catego­
ries, usually writers who have previ­
ously read at Carnegie Mellon, so it is 
very difficult to predict the winners even 
if someone is expected to win. 
There’s always an air of mys­
tery surrounding the awards. 
The Adamsons are also more 
than just an award ceremony. 
Each year a distinguished 
American writer comes to 
speak and announce the 
awards, including such greats 
as Raymond Carver, Jamaica 
Kincaid, James Tate, and 
Carolyn Kizer. This year, poet 
Robert Creeley will be the 
guest.
“It’s really exciting for me 
as a faculty member to see the 
awards,” said Daniels. “I usu­
ally don’t know who has won.... 
I get goose bumps when I see 
[the winning students] get up 
and walk down that aisle.” 
“[The Adamsons] are like 
the Oscars: people dress up, 
certain people are considered 
leading nominees, [and] there 
is a star-quality atmosphere 
given the status of the guest speaker,” 
said Kochanskyj.
Yusef also said, “They’re like the Os­
cars of the English department with the 
pre-Adamson hype to match. ‘What story 
did you submit?’ ‘Who do you think is 
going to win poetry?’ ‘How did he win, 
that story sucked!’ It’s an intense scene 
for us normally laid-back English ma-
win.... They have to be able to deal with jors.” 
rejection,” he said. “It’s a challenge to If the ceremony isn’t enough, cash
prize awards lure many students to en­
ter.
“The majority of prizes are honorable 
mentions, but there are cash awards.... 
[Submission] is financial gain,” said 
Dilworth. First place winners walk away 
with a $300 check, with smaller cash 
awards for second and third places.
After each ceremony there are also 
several parties, the first of which is held 
in the lobby ofthe Adamson Wing (where 
it is rumored that every year one of the 
paintings hung on the wall is bumped so 
security has to come over to check things 
out). Marty Riker, a senior English ma­
jor, said, “I always tell people I only 
enter for the money, which is an abso­
lute lie, and I only say it because I know 
no one will believe me anyway. I also 
make a resolution to not go to the cer­
emony every year,” he says, “and then 
decide at the last minute it would be a 
waste to miss all that free wine andbeer. 
Show me a brass ring, and I turn into a 
giddy school girl. It’s quite embarrass­
ing.”
On a more serious note, Riker said, “I 
think we’re fortunate to have something 
like the Adamsons to look forward to ... 
[but] I don’t necessarily like the idea of 
writing as competition, though I must 
say I’ve mellowed quite a bit on that 
front. I realize in my own work that it’s 
not so much writing as competition, but 
rather writing and competition, mean­
ing the existence of a contest doesn’t 
affect the content of my work, only the 
time by which it must be completed.”
As a reminder, all work has to be 
submitted to the Adamson Awards Com­
mittee by the first day after spring break: 
March 27. Everyone is encouraged to 
submit; there are categories rangingfrom 
creative writing and poetry to technical 
and magazine writing.
There are several categories for both 
graduate students and undergraduates, 
regardless of school, department, or 
major. For more information and sub­
mission guidelines, contact the English 
Department.

oiWith finals creeping up and winter 
break just a few weeks away, the end of 
the semester is near. Another fall se­
mester is drawing to a close and stu­
dents are looking forward to the novelty 
pf the spring semester.
All this seems routine to upperclass­
men but what about the freshmen? They 
have been here almost an entire semes­
ter; has college life been what they ex­
pected?
First year music major Carrie Walsh 
>vas interviewed for The Tartan in the 
beginning of the semester [“Freshman, 
senior, and graduate student discuss 
different approaches to semester,” Sep­
tember 6] regarding her expectations for 
jthe coming semester. Now that she has 
been fully integrated into college life, 
she was asked some of the same ques­
tions again to see if her perceptions have 
changed.
In the previous article Walsh men­
tioned that she expected to “work hard 
... meet new people, and make a lot of 
new friends.” One of the ways Walsh 
met new friends was through the Greek 
system. “I joined a sorority because of 
the male to female ratio, in order to meet 
good female friends.” Walsh feels her
adjustments to CMU have been posi­
tive; she’s “pretty satisfied” with her life 
here.
Dave Schimmel, a first year graphic 
design and business major, is also in­
volved in the Greek system. Schimmel 
joined his fraternity because he feels 
CMU lacks a substantial social atmo­
sphere. His fraternity provides him with 
an “outlet for stress.”
First year creative writing major Dani 
Barnard believes CMU turned out bet­
ter than her expectations. Barnard
wasn’t enthusiastic _________________
about moving to 
Pittsburgh. She 
now enjoys “the so­
cial life Pittsburgh 
offers.”
One of the unique 
characteristics of
CMU is the number ---------------------------
of students who
come here from foreign countries. 
Sanghoon Won, a first year IM major, is 
one such student.Won was bom in Ko­
rea and has been speaking English for 
three years.
Naturally, he expected language to be 
a big problem when he came here. How­
ever, Won found language was only a 
minor problem. His biggest challenge 
was understanding American issues. He
felt often that his professors used ex­
amples that were indigenous to Ameri­
can culture. Because he does not have an 
American background, he found such 
issues as political correctness very for­
eign.
Meeting new people and making new 
friends are some of the challenges first 
year students face. Bobby Lee, a first 
year undecided H&SS student, feels that 
“it is nice to get to know new people but 
it’s much easier to deal with people who 
already know you.” Barnard found her
“It's nice to get to know new people, but it's 
much easier to deal with people who already 
know you."
— Dani Barnard
friends early. Most of the people she 
hangs out with live in her dorm. Won is 
glad he met most of his friends through 
orientation. He finds it difficult to meet 
people in class because all you do is 
“listen and leave.”
Adjusting to campus cuisine is an­
other concern first year students have. 
Schimmel feels “Highlander food is not 
homecooking, but it is not pitiful.” He
believes the main problem with campus 
food is that “there aren’t enough op­
tions. The Highlander, Co-op, and 
Morewood Gardens all serve the same 
thing.” Shimel’s main staple food has 
been turkey sandwiches.
Walsh ventures to the Highlander once 
in a while but “when I’m in that hallway, 
I smell that Highlander smell and I lose 
my appetite.”
Walsh adjusted to her dislike of the 
Highlander odor by eating at the Com­
mons or just by making stuff in her
___________________ room. Barnard’s
views are similar 
to Walsh’s: She 
often makes food 
in her room. She 
feels ice cream is 
the Highlander’s 
only redeeming 
------------------------------ quality.
First year stu­
dents do not face college adjustments 
alone. The office of Residence Life pro­
vides faculty and other students as re­
sources for helping first year students to 
adjust.
One resource is freshmen orientation, 
organized this year by Kimberly 
Didinato. Working along with Didina to 
were many Orientation Counselors and 
RA’s who came back early to campus in
order to make freshmen orientation a 
success.
Lynn Pausic, a junior design major, 
was one of the head Orientation Counse­
lors during this year’s freshmen orienta­
tion. Pausic feels the way that orienta­
tion is most beneficial for freshmen ad­
justment through the “exposure of as 
many issues as possible.” Orientation 
concentrates on social and academic as­
pects, as well as health and safety con­
cerns. Pausic believes that such expo­
sure “helps to prepare them for the expe­
riences they will most likely face.”
This freshmen class was smaller than 
in previous years, but this did not cut 
down on the level of enthusiasm. Pausic 
noted that “there was more participa­
tion by the students. It wasn’t necessar­
ily that the numbers were higher, but 
those involved were more eager to par­
ticipate.”
Orientation occurs not only at the be­
ginning of the fall semester but at the 
beginning of the spring semester as well. 
This year, Winter Orientation takes 
place on January 22,1995.
Winter Orientation differs from Fall 
Orientation because it is open to all 
students. The main focus in Winter Ori­
entation concerns issues that students 
have encountered now that they are 
integrated with college life.

Focus on the Internet
by Kenton Shaver
Before the year winds down, I’d 
like to take some time to pass 
along queries I’ve received from 
my readers to a local expert: 
DrNet. “Dear DrNet. I’m an Art 
major and I used the 
alt.binaries.erotica tree a lot for 
still life modeling. Now that the
group has been banned by CMU, 
do I have any recourse? Sign me, 
Techno Artist.”
Well, Techno Artist, I recom­
mend that you check out the “Cen­
sorship at CMU” World WideWeb 
page (http://www.cs.cmu.edu: 
8001/afs/cs. cmu.edu/usr/kcf/ 
www/censor/), find yourself a 
public NNTP server, and dig up a 
news reader. Get to work!
“Dear DrNet, I have really 
tough Calculus classes this 
semster and noticed that there’s 
a group called netnews.sci.math 
with a lot of really smart people 
on it. Do you think they’d mind if 
I asked them about integrals? 
Sign me, Calcophobic.”
Well, Calcophobic, ifthese ques­
tions are on homework problems, 
it’s a misuse of the net to ask 
them. Of course your TA may be 
a sci.math reader too, in which 
case you had better not be asking 
homework questions there! (http 
//www. c2. org/re mail/by - 
www.html) It’s perfectly OK to 
ask him or her course-related 
questions, though, but maybe 
between the hours of midnight 
and 5 AM. Good luck.
“Dear DrNet, I find that hang­
ing out with my good buddies on 
our Internet Relay Chat channel 
is much more fun than studying 
for any of my six final examina­
tions. Don’t you think so? Sign
me, Procrastinator.”
I agree, Procrastinator, espe­
cially since we are probably not 
in any of the same classes. How­
ever, the surest way to fail is to 
avoid trying. Power that CPU 
down. ’Attaboy!
“Dear DrNet, I found these re­
ally great bootleg games on an 
FTP server in Idaho. I’ve been 
having my scruples about down­
loading them, but 60’s Free Love 
is just like the 90’s Free Soft­
ware, right? Sign me, Happy 
Gamer.”
Well, Happy Gamer, the 60’s 
weren’t really that great but in 
any case, I don’t think they jus­
tify software piracy, even if the
book of love was temporarily 
thrown out. Even if you think 
that you can get away with it, it’s 
still an abuse of the Internet. 
NetScape and Web Explorer (OS/ 
2’s WWW browser), which was 
used while writing the last col­
umn, are both commercial prod­
ucts.
W3 and Mosaic, on the other 
hand, don’t cost you anything to 
legally use. which is why I only 
mentioned them last week. CMU 
has site licenses to a lot of soft­
ware, and many other applica­
tions, like EzMail and MacMail, 
were developed in house. These 
can be cheap or free. Take advan­
tage of campus resources.
“Dear DrNet, my girlfriend says 
that my dirty frat room horrifies 
her but that when my mind is in 
a similar state, it often has quite 
the opposite effect on her. Why is 
this? Sign me, Loco. PS: I’ve got a 
Mac in my room.”
Loco, I don’t know that your 
question has much to do with 
“Focused on the Internet,” but 
why not try painting your com­
puter lime green and buying a 
cactus for it.

¦Tartan Staffwriter
,j “Last Thursday, members of Spirit 
•met with administrators and Campus 
.jpolice officials to discuss alleged harass­
ement of blacks, specifically males on 
„campus.... They charged Campus Police 
,,with harassment and discrimination.”
These words were written by Tartan 
.(Stafiwriter Michael Ewedosh, in [ “Blacks 
-;charge security with harassment,” 
March 21, 1989.] Although the events 
«^described in the article occurred just five 
jyears ago, most of us have no knowledge 
oof this past history. Relations between 
Campus Police and students, particu­
larly students of color, have been a heated 
jissue for many years at CMU, though 
-the majority of us exist in utter igno­
rance of this fact.
-r Back in ’89, the University had such 
oserious problems with Campus Police 
..land its alleged treatment of students of 
2Color that black student leaders joined 
forces with alumni and the NAACP to 
{launch a major campaign against them. 
I,The media’s response to this action forced 
-administrators to enact a series of cam- 
Kpus-wide diversity workshops, the ma­
jority of which ended a few years back, 
due to limited student participation, the 
minority of which have remained com­
ponents of basic training for campus 
police officers.
Although no new major charges of 
cdiscrimination and harassment have 
^been filed since the incident, the ques­
tion remains: have relations between 
9Campus Police and students of color 
?really improved since 1989, or have ad­
ministrators and students alike simply 
re-adjusted back into the status quo of
race relations at CMU?
“When I was a freshman I remember 
upper-classmen telling me stories about 
cops stopping them and asking them for 
their IDs, and if they went to school 
here. It doesn’t happen anymore, and if 
it does, it’s a rare occurrence,” said Will 
Motley, a senior civil engineering major 
who was arrested by Campus Police ear­
lier this year, due to a perceived alterca­
tion between he and his roommate. The 
charges have since been dropped.
“As far as cops go, I never really had a 
problem with the way that Campus Po­
lice do their busi- ______________________
ness.
“Except that in 
certain situa­
tions where 
there’s a minor­
ity involved they 
tend to be less 
flexible. The per­
ception received
by me and a lot of other people of color on 
this campus is that whites can get away 
with a lot more on campus than we can,” 
said Motley.
“At the last Spirit party one of the 
CMU officers walked up the stairs to the 
house with a night stick visible in his 
hand. I’m sure that when there are fights 
in the frats you don’t see the same offic­
ers walking into a frat house with a 
night stick in his hand. This is represen­
tative of how the cops treat a situation 
with a black involved differently than 
they would treat a situation with a 
white,” said Motley.
“Of the people (police officers) that I 
work with, I don’t think that anybody 
here has it in for students, or students of 
color in particular,” said Bill Kaiser,
Campus Police detective.
“As far as race-relations go, it’s a touchy 
subject because we’re dealing with 
people’s perceptions, and sometimes 
these are correct, and sometimes they’re 
not....
“When I’m in the field I have to con­
sider tactical law-enforcement, public- 
safety, and officer safety issues.... A lot 
of this is judgment. A lot of this stuff can 
be perceived in a way that it was never 
meant to be,” said Kaiser.
“I’ve stopped all kinds of people: blacks, 
Asians, Indians, whites. It’s very diffi-
“Of the people that I work with, I don't think 
that anybody here has it in for students, or 
students of color in particular."

cult when I have a complete description 
of somebody and I have to go approach 
someone and talk to them. A couple of 
times people thought I was stopping 
them because they were black and they 
accused me of being a racist. But I stopped 
people because they fit a description, not 
because I wanna walk all the way over to 
a certain area and question a black guy,” 
Kaiser added.
Speaking about these issues, Gloria 
Hill, director of CMAP said, “I honestly 
believe that Chief Lapaglia has been 
real responsive to situations that have 
come up, and that he has tried to sensi­
tize the police force. But what happens 
around here is that the attention to 
diversity and sensitivity goes in cycles. 
We focus on it when something happens
and then we don’t deal with it until the 
situation comes up again. We’re in a 
reactionary rather than preventative 
mode.”
Hill said that Campus Police officers 
have a dual responsibility to protect 
students, and to respect their rights. 
“Students aren’t always aware of what 
their rights are. It’s critical for students 
to become familiar with their rights. It’s 
particularly important for students and 
black students here, because typically 
they have not had a lot of experience in 
dealing with the police.
_______________ “Contrary to stereo­
types about people of 
color, by and large, the 
ones on this campus 
don’t fit the stereo­
type. They’re good stu­
dents, they’ve done 
community service, 
they’re good kids. 
¦¦¦¦¦¦ Therefore, when they 
get into a situation with police it be­
comes very threatening, because they 
haven’t had experience,” said Hill.
Hill offered suggestions of actions that 
the University could take to improve 
student/police relations. “You have to 
educate the campus community about 
what behaviors and situations can get 
you into trouble with the Campus Po­
lice.
“If the Campus Police go into a situa­
tion in which they just get to know stu­
dents better, and this takes place on the 
other side (students’) too, then students 
will become familiar with what campus 
security is all about. Education is the 
key,” said Hill.
Chief of Security James Lapaglia ex­
plained recent pro-active measures the
security department is employing, in 
conjunction with Student Affairs, to 
improve student/police relations. “We’re 
looking at three primary areas: traiii- 
ing, department policies and procedure^, 
and direct communications.... As far ¿fs 
training goes, we’re focusing on internal 
training with the sensitive crime unit, 
training in dealing with diverse groups, 
and in dealing with hate crimes. Interns 
of policies and procedures, our primàtÿ 
function is to give guidance and instruc­
tion to our officers in particular situa­
tions,” said Lapaglia.
“One thing that’s been lacking th&’t 
we’re starting this year is direct commu­
nications. With that in mind, some of the 
things we’re doing in Student Affairs fs 
working with different student groups 
in educational conference meetings. It 
started in November and is running 
throughout the rest of the year. We’re 
assigning liaison officers to groups that 
express an interest in having direct com­
munication with our department. We’ve 
already assigned one of our officers, 
Martin White, as a liaison with Spirit,” 
said Lapaglia.
“This relationship with different 
groups would give input to our policies 
and what we’re doing, thus it would be 
more likely for people to accept them as 
being fair.... We’d like to solicit any stu­
dents reading this article to provide their 
input to any available media, be it e- 
mail, phone, or just stopping by,” said 
Lapaglia.
Motley expressed his opinion on this 
matter: “I think it’s good that there aie 
some officers that want to come to our 
meetings and talk to us, but if those 
officers are not the source of the problem 
then it’s not gonna help matters much.”

from suburban New Jersey who 
(1) discover that they’re “differ­
ent” from the mainstream; (2) get 
their noses pierced; and (3) flock 
to “underground” parties and 
drink cheap vodka until they 
throw up.
This scene has already begun 
¡to annoy people, and all signs

but in order to deal more appro­
priately with the situation, Stu­
dent Affairs may begin handing 
out airline-style “sick sack” vomit 
bags in the freshman orienta­
tion packets.
On a related note, the number 
of geek couples on campus will, 
in all probability, multiply be­
yond all reasonable proportions; 
numerous public displays of af­
fection will incense the campus 
to revolt. A grassroots “Stamp 
Out Ugly Love” movement will 
gain widespread 
popularity and na­
tional attention, 
but the problem 
will nevertheless

the student body.
And what about the future of 
sex? It’s a tough one to predict. 
Very little information can be 
found on the current state of af­
fairs of sex at CMU, perhaps be­
cause so little activity exists in 
the first place. To wit: in a recent 
poll that asked CMU students to 
rate their sex lives, respondents 
described their typical partners 
as being “at- arm’s length” and 
“reliable”; major turnoffs included 
hangnails and carpal tunnel syn­

jects like: The History of Physics 
and its Influence on the Papacy, 
Artificial intelligence and Theat­
rical Interaction, Psychological 
Foundations of Modern Economic 
Theory, or Music, Sculpture, and 
the Prime Number.
Most of the classes are taught 
by one professor, but imagine how 
hard CMU had to look to find 
them.
As always, CMU is still at the 
forefront of digital networking. 
Because of recent technological
developments and the sudden 
increase in interest because of 
the courses offered, the student 
body has grown to 20,000. Most 
of them never set foot on the cam­
pus. Instead, they are tele-com- 
muters that log onto Andrew from 
around the world and watch 
classes. They have to ask ques­
tions and do homework through 
electronic mail. This isn’t nearly 
as interactive so such students 
actually earn virtual degrees that 
they receive through email. But, 
hey, they probably get fed a lot 
better.
It may sound like technology 
has taken over the classes. It has, 
well, most of them anyway. There 
is something of a retro movement 
in the “older” fields from the col­
leges of MCS, H&SS and CFA. 
You will occasionally see theEth-

¡a few days before the news got 
¡around to me that the U.S. Gov­

¡building of an experimental labo­
ratory on our campus, which 
¡would replace the entire Cut.
i There was some top-secret 
¡agenda that we as students 
¡weren’t to know about, 
j Yet the evidence of its pre sence 
¡crept in as the year progressed: 
¡the university buildings were 
¡quickly condensed into a single 
tarea to make more room for the 
¡government laboratory, and we 
i!?egan to see officials and people 
ln white coats as we walked
through the campus. Classes be­
gan to be held over the Internet 
system, so that there was less of 
a need for classrooms.
It was all revealed in the mid­
summer of1996, the entire story 
of what had initiated on our cam­
pus surfaced world-wide, the 
whole thing dubbed The Revolu­
tion.
A group of computer scientists 
and biologists within the univer­
sity had been working under a 
government grant to successfully 
arrive at what was one of the 
largest technological advances of 
the day: the ability to duplicate 
human life form through a com­
bination of computer program­
ming and controlled gene-cultur­
ing.
At that point every stone, brick, 
and cement building had been 
knocked down as if in a breath of 
air, and the years of time that 
had brushed the walls was 
dragged away in broken chunks 
in large tanks. The solar-pan­
elled monsters stood in place, and 
the dark block of the university 
was surrounded in its entirety by 
a laser shield.
Soon the gymnasium, the li­
brary, the football field, and the 
cafeterias were gone as well, and 
we were left immobile in the dark 
andimpotent womb of future gen­
erations.

Rajasthan is the desert state in 
northwest India, from which six 
artists have come to the Hunt 
Institute for Botanical Documen­

tradition of their country. As is 
customary in India, artists learn 
their painting skills from their 
fathers and grandfathers. Many 
of these skills have come from

do not view “creative” and “copy­

words that come together in the 
paintings executed in watercolor, 
gouache or tempra, as well as in 
pigments from earths and semi­
precious stones.
“Folk art” or “fine” art, I ask. 
This is such a different exhibi­
tion because one must not enter 
it with a Western perception — 
thinking it is only pure plagirism. 
As said one of the artists, “If a 
Westerner hears the beginning 
of a familiar story, he is likely to 
say, ‘Oh, no, not that one again. 
I’ve already heard it.’ But to an

Fuente entertains
By PAUL TABACHNECK
Tartan Assistant Diversions Editor
Play: Fuente Ovejuna 
Place: University of Pittsburgh 
Starring: Howard Williams Jr., Laura Smiley, 
William A. Thomas, III
Written by Frey Felix Lope de Vega Carpio in 
the early 17th century, Fuente Ovejuna is a 
retelling of an infamous incident in a Spanish 
village of the same name; 
the peasants of the town got 
together and killed their tyr­
annous commander. When 
brought to trial, all they told 
the royal judges was that it 
was Fuente Ovejuna who had 
commited the crime. Today,
Pitt Theatre has chosen to 
retell this age-old story to us, 
the theater-goers of 
society.There is an inherent 
challenge posed in directing 
a production of a play writ­
ten before the early 1900’s; 
prose style so often used in 
that day is natural, and it’s 
very tempting to just slip into 
it. It was written that way; 
it’s comfortable.
Unfortunately, this pro
ducti on lacks, at times,; ofthe restraint so essen­
tial to this type of play. There are times when it 
is appropriate, such as the: singing of songs, but 
once it is revealed that the rhyme scheme goes 
beyond those moments, the audience finds them­
selves subdued in the attempt to parse the other 
lines into the A/B/A/B rhyme scheme.
This, combined with a kind of general feel of
amateurish theatrical interaction—you get the 
feeling that the actors are thinking to them­
selves, “OK, I've said my line, and now, he’s 
gonna say his, and then..."—makes the first act 
go down somewhat poorly. When both of these 
disadvantages work together, you get a play 
that was written to flow endlessly, but won’t 
flow at all because no one is working on the same 
wavelength.
After the intermission, however, the real 
dramats stand up. When Laurencia, played by 
Laura Smiley (Jeffrey, The 
Only Jealousy ofEmer 
) bursts into the scene in 
her state of broken innocence, 
one finally feels the sting and 
the reality of the situation. 
Fuente Ovejuna is in dark 
times, and something must 
be done. Consistently excel­
lent performances were also 
given by Lori Anne Sharpless 
as -Jacinta and David 
Pellegrini as the oafish 
Mengo, as well as the trio of 
actors who represented “The 
Rulers,” who, when not in ac­
tion, remained still in their 
regal postures (Andy

Manrique.) seeming to over-

Smiley and William A. Thomas HI.
see the entire play. A smile for that detail goes to 
the director, graduate student Kevin Wetmore,

All in all, it’s not a bad play; although lacking 
in the first act, it does shape up to produce a nice 
finale. Just don’t go expecting the great cultural 
experience; some theat re is just entertaining for 
entertainment’s sake.

November 26 drew probably the larg­
est crowd of disenchanted, angst-filled 
youth to the Civic Arena ever to see the 
man who makes his living selling his 
personal suffering, Trent Reznor of Nine 
Inch Nails.
The evening began horribly as I 
watched the two opening groups, Marilyn 
Manson and The Jim Rose Circus, from 
my vantage point in the undisputed worst 
seat in the house. Actually that was a 
blessing in disguise; I‘m glad I couldn’t 
see the openers too closely.
Marilyn Manson has been causing a 
little bit of a stir with their disturbing— 
no, disgusting — lyrics, and rightly so. 
Song titles like “Cake and Sodomy” and 
a not-so-negative view of child abuse 
have earned them this.
Their music was unimaginative. All 
you had to hear was the first song and 
you heard all that Manson had to offer. 
The bright points of their performance 
weren?t even original. They opened by 
reciting the haunting poem from the 
boat ride in Willy Wonka and the Choco­
late Factory which they played to open­
ing verse of the Eurythmics’ “Sweet 
Dreams”. Even though the lead singer 
named is Marilyn, you can’t dispute his 
manhood. He displayed it to the crowd.
Second up was the Jim Rose Circus 
which was slightly more entertaining, 
yet I still couldn’t see too much because 
of my horrid seat. Jim Rose has as­
sembled a freak show if there ever was 
one and, being a Nineties kinda guy is 
multicultural about it.
The circus consisted of a female who 
laid on a bed of nails (topless, which I 
found completely sexist and useless,) an
Asian pseudo-Sumo wrestler who laid 
on razor sharp (so they say) swords, an 
Armenian contortionist, and a guy with 
so many tattoos you couldn’t distinguish 
his race. There was also the All- Ameri­
can white boy, Mr. Lift-O, who lifted 
things with various parts of his pierced 
body. All of these tricks were done while 
Rose provided sportscaster-like banter.
Finally, after two opening acts that 
didn’t nearly provide my $26 worth, it 
was time for Nine Inch Nails to take the 
stage.
Their performance began with a ex­
tended version of the instrumental “Pin-^ 
ion,” and then Rezrior shot through the 
drapes covering most of the stage and 
started into “Mr. Self Destruct.”
The crowd on the Arena floor, the 
general admission pit, surged toward 
the stage for a better view of the rather 
puny Mr. Reznor. The crowd swarmed
about as one large moshing mass during 
the MTV hit “Wish.”
Although the music was clearly enter­
taining, I found myself mesmerized by 
the spectacular light show.
This was clearly worth the wait and 
the money.
It was often difficult to decide what to 
pay attention to, Reznor as he raced 
about the stage hopping on monitors 
and wreaking havoc on the equipment, 
the mesmerizing lights that pulsed to 
the beat, or the crowd full of people that 
looked more like one living organism as 
it moved in its chaotic path.
Also, during “Eraser” and “Hurt,” the 
screen that covered the stage during the 
opening acts fell once again for a movie 
that I was unfortunately unable to see 
thanks to my seat on the far right of the 
stage. The only thing I could make out is 
blood covering the screen at the begin­
ning of “The Downward Spiral”.
Anticipated songs like “Sin” and “Head 
Like a Hole” from NIN’s first album, 
Pretty Hate Machine, brought on the 
most crowd response, but I enjoyed the 
more obscure songs like “Gave Up” and 
“Reptile.”
Following “Head Like a Hole,” the 
band took a break and returned for a 
four song encore consisting of “Closer,” 
“Dead Souls,” “I Do Not Want This,” and 
“Something I Can Never Have” for what 
Reznor called, “The closest thing I have 
to a hometown crowd,” since he’s from 
Mercer, Pennsylvania.
Nine Inch Nails easily made up for the 
disappointment of the two openers. It 
was well worth the money (it has to be 
expensive just to compensate for the 
equipment Reznor destroys in a night!) 
If you have a chance, check them out 
when they come to your town.
nf­­ kCf[UF ­uuFf rD Killing Zoe vrgb lru­fDzfp h[]bfh
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
Boys today are having pretty weird fantasies 
with call-girls; Remember True Romance1? In Kill­
ing Zoe, Eric Stoltz is the American safe-cracker 
who gets invited to Paris “on business.” At the 
beginning, things go very well; his “wife for the 
night” is Zoe (Julie Delphy), an art student that 
works days as a bank teller and nights as a call-girl 
to pay her tuition. Obviously they like each other 
since they both have ‘z’ names, Zed and Zoe. But 
sooner than you’d expect, Eric (Jean-Hugues 
Anglade) comes in, greets Zed, and throws Zoe, all 
in about three minutes. You see, Eric is in a hurry 
because they are robbing a bank tomorrow.
What follows is mostly an exercise in distorted 
camera angles and whimsical focusing. Zed gets 
introduced to Eric’s gang, a bunch of trashy drug-
addicts you would never rob a bank with. After 
spending about five minutes planning the heist, 
they go out and stone their brains out; after all, this 
is living life. Next morning they go to rob the bank 
and (surprise, surprise) all hell breaks loose. You 
see, nobody would make a movie about a bank 
robbery that works; there wouldn’t be enough 
blood in it.
Now mind you, this can’t be your ordinary heist 
movie. For one, it was directed by Roger Avary 
who’s a pal of Tarantino back from the ol’ film-buff 
days. From this, we know that Avary must be 
pretty knowledgeable in film. And he has to be, 
since Killing Zoe features tricks used by Carax, 
Melville, and Walt Disney, plus footage from 
Murnau’s Nosferatu. In this case, no amount of 
tricks can save this mess. You see, not every film- 
buff can make a decent film.
There’s a considerable fraction of the fans of the
neo-violent films that enjoy them purely for the 
violence. They get a thrill each time a chainsaw or 
a katana is shown on the screen. They ponder at 
the possibilities. They wait for the cool thug to blast 
away the un-cool thug to see his intestines. Well, if 
you give them a movie like Le Samourai or Reser­
voir Dogs, they are missing out big time. You see, 
movies like these have actual content. There’s a 
reason behind the violence first of all, and the 
violence is real.
Now Avary doesn’t seem to have learned that 
lesson. He seems to be one of the fans of blood for 
blood’s sake. The whole movie plays like a bad trip. 
This could mean potential, but Avary is just way 
too clumsy to take advantage of it. The montage in 
some scenes will literally make you squirm. And 
the acting may do so too. Stoltz is almost dead. 
Julie Delphy’s fans, myself included, will be glad to 
see her, but I recommend renting White instead of
watching this. And I thought it was always good to 
see Anglade. He’s one of my favorites, being the 
free-as-a-bird tender intellectual that gets the gor­
geous French girlfriends. But as a crazed criminal, 
he can get a little annoying, especially with the 
repetitive, clumsy dialogue. You see, not even good 
actors can save a script like this.
However, not everything can be bad, even in 
today’s cinema. In a sense it is good that indepen­
dent movies like this get made. And that feel of 
hard-core filming is especially necessary these 
days. We need as many independent filmmakers 
out there as we can get. But they must remember 
that they are making movies, not videos. Avary 
probably forgot this when making a sex scene that 
cuts to Nosferatu in the TV. Having lots of gun­
shots and chaotic situations does not make a movie 
good. You’ve got to have a tale, and the skill to tell 
it.
The Nutcracker zb[ChF zbr­mCfDp [wmrfDzf uafDrDy Drybg
By BETHANY SUTTON
Tartari Staffwriter
An audience of all ages came to the 
Benedum this past Friday to ring in 
opening night of the Pittsburgh Ballet 
Theatre’s (PBT) annual holiday produc­
tion of The Nutcracker.
Upon arriving at the recently reno­
vated Benedum, I was awe-struck; its 
cathedral ceilings and brass chandeliers, 
Patrons in tuxedos and velvet gowns, 
and everything from dolls and orna­
ments to hand carved, hand made Nut­
crackers piled high on a table in the
Over 100 local children, as well as 
members of the PBT’s internationally 
acclaimed troupe, make up the cast. 
This includes both students of the PBT 
School and pre-professional students 
from the Scheneley High School Pro­
gram, all chosen as the result of an 
extensive audition with PBT School Di­
rector David Holladay.
“These children make a commitment 
that they must see through from the 
first rehearsal to the last performance, 
even when the going gets tough,” re­
marked Artistic Director Patricia Wilde. 
Rehearsal begins the day after audi-
all day at the theater for both matinee 
and evening shows.
As the curtain rose, it became clear 
that The Nutcracker is indeed a ballet 
for children first. Or, as George 
Balanchine, who choreographed the clas­
sic 1954 version for the New York City 
Ballet on which PBT’s production is 
based, once said, “The Nutcracker at our 
theater is for children young and old. 
That is, for children and for adults who 
are children at heart... In every person 
the best, most important part is that 
which remains from his childhood.”
A----------0------------------------------ ---------*_________________j_________ Indeed, the entire ballet is set from
iobby like gifts under the tree combined tions, and continues every weekend un- the perspective of a child, Mary, who is 
to create an irreplaceable holiday glow, til the curtain goes up. Once the perfor- given a nutcracker by her mysterious 
*ne inside of the theater was equally mances begin, many ofthe children must Uncle Drosselmeyer during her parents’ 
unpressive. participate every night, often spending holiday party. She sneaks downstairs
later that night to play with her new 
doll, and is transported into a magical 
world where the nutcracker becomes 
life-size and the adult dancers perform 
for her and her prince (who actually 
turns out to be her Uncle’s nephew) in 
the Land of Snow and Kingdom of 
Sweets.
The artistry of British designer Peter 
Farmer’s set and costumes was spec­
tacular. It took Russian tailors three to 
four days to make each tuxedo for the 
parents in Act I, as well as 
Drosele.meyer’s wine-colored cape and 
coat, and the PBT Costume Shop spent 
more than 70 hours in creating the seven 
unique rag dolls in the party scene.
The 25 pounds of flame-proof white 
confetti, 150 pounds of dry ice, and 4,440
tiny twinkling lights used during each 
performance are just a few of the many 
special effects which make this produc­
tion so awe-inspiring for both children 
and adults.
The flowering silk tent which slowly 
grows in height during Act II is unique 
as a centerpiece in the Kingdom of 
Sweets; no other company in the world 
features such a backdrop in their pro­
duction of the ballet.
Tiffany Knoll, a sophomore at the 
University of Pittsburgh who has stud­
ied ballet for the past 10 years, said, 
“The technical superiority of the danc­
ers amazes me. Out of all the produc­
tions of The Nutcracker I’ve seen, none 
has impressed me quite as much as the 
Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre’s.”

Junior FwCaCrFfFp mf­rybgF
By BELL VANDERMARK
Tartan Staffwriter
The new Ivan Reitman movie 
Junior was actually enjoyable. 
Yes, I said enjoyable. Once you 
look past the fact that Arnold 
Schwarzenegger not only gets 
pregnant but also dresses up in 
drag, this becomes a rather pleas­
ant movie.
The movie stars Arnold 
Schwarzenegger as the 
stuffy Dr. Alex Hess, 
who only cares about his 
work, Danny Devito as 
the carefree Larry 
Aberrgast, Hess’ part­
ner, and Emma Thomp­
son as the lost-in-space 
scientist who takes over 
Schwarzenegger’s lab at 
the college where he’s 
working.
There are two wonder­
ful supporting charac­
ters who have appear­
ances throughout the 
movie. One is the ever 
charming Pamela Reed, 
who plays Devito’s ex- 
wife, who also happens 
to be pregnant. The other is the 
stern-looking Frank Langella, 
who plays Noah Barnes, the ad­
ministrator of the University 
Labs.
The gist of the movie is simple; 
Devito and Schwarzenegger are 
working on a medication that will 
prevent miscarriages.
When they present the idea to 
the FDA, they are turned down 
flat. Langella gives their lab space 
to Thompson. Schwarzenegger 
decides to go back to Europe and 
start another project.
Sounds like a cut-and-dried 
plot, right? Wrong.
Devito has a Canadian firm that
ence. All they need to do is carry movies and pairing old co-stars
the embryo through the first tri­
mester of pregnancy to glean 
enough data to sell the drug.
The complications, and there 
are quite a few, begin popping up 
almost immediately. First the 
pair need an egg to complete the 
experiment. They steal one from 
Thompson’s character, with 
whom they are now sharing lab 
space.

Is that a Terminator in your pocket, or are you just 
pregnant? Arnold Schwartzenegger and Danny 
Devito create a man-bourn child for the love of their 
science in the new Ivan Reitman film, Junior.
The plot only gets wackier from really knows his stuff.
together. Danny Devito and 
Arnold Schwarzenegger were co- 
stars in Twins. Schwarzenegger 
and Reed worked together on 
Kindergarten Cop. Langella re­
cently starred in Dave, another 
Reitman comedy for which Th­
ompson was almost cast.
The only surprise in the cast 
seems to be Emma Thompson. 
The usually serious stage actress 
sheds her intelligent per­
sona to play a scientist 
who is hopelessly lost 
both inside and outside 
of the lab. The direction 
itself, however, is excel­
lent. Reitman has come a 
long way since his early 
days as a director when 
we received such garbage 
as Cannibal Girls in 
1973.
One nice thing about 
the movie was the fact 
that the boom mike al­
ways seemed to operate 
so expertly. I believe that 
the credit for this goes 
solely to Ravi Bruce the 
boom operator. The man
there. Now don’t get me wrong, I 
don’t believe for an instant that 
any of this could happen, but, 
hey, if I followed that philosophy, 
I’d have never seen Star Wars 
either. So ifyou buy into the whole 
pregnancy joke, you get a really 
funny movie with some utterly 
hilarious moments.
For instance, Schwarzenegger, 
who by now is almost seven weeks 
pregnant, is standing in the lab 
and for no reason whatsoever just 
decides to tell anyone who cares, 
“Boy, my nipples are sensitive.” 
As if that wasn’t odd enough, 
the comments that follow will 
will be willing to back the drug if keep you laughing even if it’s
they had some kind of data say­
ing that it would work. Not being 
able to legally give it to a woman, 
Devito convinces Amie to become 
pregnant all in the name of sci-
only at the sheer absurdity of the 
whole thing.
Ivan Reitman, who directed the 
film, has once again captured 
magic by going back through past
If you’re thinking about going 
to see this movie and can’t decide 
if you’ll be able to look past the 
fact that Schwarzenegger is preg­
nant, then go just to see the excel­
lent boom work by Ravi. I’m sure 
he’ll appreciate your praise and 
gratitude.
He’s so down to earth and he 
doesn’t get a swelled head like 
some of the other so-called “ex­
perts” in Hollywood. This man is 
a gem and it makes the movie 
twice as enjoyable knowing that 
Reitman and the producers chose 
Ravi to do the work that he is 
famous for.
Final recommendation: go see 
the movie, but don’t take the kids. 
If little Johnny thinks there is 
even the slightest chance that it 
could happen to him, he’ll be 
scarred for life.

COMIC BOOK CHRONICLES
by Jason Andracki
Since this will be the final installment of 
Comic Book Chronicles for 1994, this is a perfect 
time for a wrap up and pseudo-awards shindig.
Best Ongoing Series — Without a doubt, 
this has to be John Byrne’s Next Men. Over the 
past three years, Byrne has woven an intricate, 
character driven story that gets better with 
every issue.
While other artists are putting all the bells 
and whistles they can into their art, Byrne has 
trimmed his style down and placed focus on 
more important details. I can actually identify 
all the characters of this book without relying on 
fancy costumes.
Runners Up: Superman: Man of Steel, Shadow 
of the Bat. Both of these are head and shoulders 
above the rest, of the Superman and Batman 
lines.
Best Limited Series — Shadow Empires: 
Faith Conquers. Chris Moeller has produced the 
best original science fiction story since Walt 
Simonsen’s Star Stammers.
Moeller provides extensive background forhis 
universe in this limited series that hopefully 
will be continued. Also, Moeller’s painting gives 
the characters much personality and emotion. 
Runners Up: Danger Unlimited and Babe. Both 
of these limited series brought back the joy that 
initially got me into comics. I hope to see more of 
them, too.
Best Writer—This was clearly the easiest to 
decide — John Byrne. With John Byrne’s Next 
Men, Dariger Unlimited, and Babe, plus the 
Action Comics annual, how can you dispute that 
he is the best?
Clearly, he is the only creator worthy to follow 
in the late, great Jack “King” Kirby’s footsteps. 
I’m eagerly looking forward to his Darkseid/ 
Galactus crossover.
Runners Up: Peter David for his revamping of 
one of my old favorites, Aquaman, and Alan 
Davis (ClanDestine), for making me buy a Mar­
vel comic again.
Best Artist — This was a little tougher to
decide, but just on consistency and a large 
output, I’m going with John Byrne again. He’s 
no Stephen Platt (thankfully), filling every panel 
with detail after detail, but he has the most 
realistic portrayal of people and commonplace 
things.
Runners Up: Mike Mignola was some stiff 
competition with his beautiful work in HellBoy 
and the covers for many of DC’s annual this 
year. (He also won for most times mentioned in 
this column.) Jim Lee is the only Image founder 
that I can tolerate, and I’ve been a fan since his 
days on PunisherWar Journal. But since he’s on 
hiatus now, he was out of the running.
Best Inker — I’ll have to go with the legend, 
Dick Giordano. I’ll always treasure his work 
with various Superman and Batman books. I 
just wish he’d take over on one of the those books 
regularly rather than just as a guest, like with 
Superman #96.
Runners Up: Brad Vancata was great on 
Aquaman but he seems to have disappeared. 
Also.MarkFarmeris helping Alan Davis regain 
some of their glory from Excalibur with 
ClanDestine.
Best Graphic Novel — P. Craig Russell’s 
second volume of The Fairy Tales of Oscar 
Wilde.
Hey, it’s one of the top recommended gift 
books for children this holiday season. Buy it for 
a kid you love. Runners Up: Castle of the Bat. 
Tales to Astonish.
Best Black & White Book — Bone by Jeff 
Smith. Don’t be skeptical about all the hype, it 
is that good. Runners Up: Milk & Cheese, Dark 
Horse Presents.
Best New Series — ClanDestine which isn’t 
as good as Excaliber, but it’ll do. Runners Up: 
Aquaman, Judge Dredd.
Best Publisher — Dark Horse. No one even 
compares, so there are no runners up. Their 
Star Wars books, as well as others like Badger, 
plus their publisher credit for the Legend guys 
almost givesthis company an unfair advantage.
Well, there you have my picks. It would be 
nice if everyone agrees, but it’s a lot more 
interesting if you disagree with me, so let me 
know what you think!
JasonAndracki, sophomore professional writ­
ing major, would like to be very Politically 
inCorrect and say Merry Christmas and Happy 
Chanukah to all who will listen. If this offended 
anyone, I’U have an even merrier Christmas.THE TARTAN

Paradise lost
I By PAUL TABACHNECK
S Tartan Asst. Diversions Editor
\ Movie: Trapped In Paradise 
I Starring: Dana Carvey, Nicho- 
! las Cage, Jon Lovitz
I I was sick. I was tired. I wanted 
nothing more than a bed and a 
bottle of NyQuil.
I was having the time of my life. 
! This movie puts Dana Carvey 
and Jon Lovitz together as two 
brothers who just got out of prison 
I on parole.
[ Carvey is a diagnosed klepto­
maniac, and Lovitz is a patho- 
| logical liar. They get picked up 
by their oldest brother, played by 
Nicholas Cage, and they convince 
j him into going on a journey from 
their warm, snug, minimum- 
wage life in New York, to Para­
dise, Pennsylvania.
A small-town bank carrying 
$750,000 and no security awaits 
I them, ripe for the picking. They 
get the money and decide to leave.
[ The problem is, they can’t.
Their car is run off the road, 
and there’s tons of snow every­
where, as well as a ton of friendly 
I townsfolk who are all willing to 
take in a stranger off the street.
As the night passes on, they 
find themselves getting to know 
the very people they robbed, and 
i their consciences start to ache.
But will they ever get out of Para­
dise? Will they evade the law? 
What about those wacky crimi­
nals that break out to find them 
and get the money back? What 
about their mother, who is taken 
hostage by said criminals? What 
about the foxy daughter of the big 
criminal?
Most importantly, can the citi­
zens of Paradise find their Christ­
mas back?
The only thing that really bites 
me about this movie is the bla­
tant use of formula all over the 
place; there’s a lot of “character” 
characters, the kind that are just 
cut out and put in the middle of 
the script, and it makes some of 
the wrap-up just a little predict­
able.
In its defense, however, I actu­
ally liked it. Garvey’s character is 
hilarious, and JonLovitz’s trade­
mark style is recognizable from 
frame one.
Cage plays an excellent straight 
man, and their mother, played by 
Florence Stanley (My Two Dads, 
Night Court), was a terrific 
smartass, despite the fact that 
her character was just as much a 
formula as many of the others.
It’s a great wacky flick, but not 
one to see if you’re a plot stickler. 
If you’re sick and need a cheer- 
up, though, I would recommend 
this movie in an instant.

While watching six short 
plays in about two hours may 
sound like a chore to some, City 
Theatre made it more like a 
pleasant diversion with their 
production of David Ives’ All In 
the Timing-, a sort of cerebral, 
fast-paced, and fairly funny 
sketch comedy show. Starring 
three actors from Chicago’s 
Northlight Theatre and two lo­
cals, this quick and interesting 
piece was less detailed and se­
rious than last season’s City 
Theatre fare, but still a rousing 
good time.
From Trotsky to brave new 
languages, David Ives moves 
through a series of odd and in­
teresting ideas that are full of 
wit and physical antics; For 
example, the fourthplay, Philip 
Glass Buys a Loaf of Bread, is a 
farce of avant-garde theatre
that forces the actors to chant 
single words to make simple sen­
tences, using only a few phrases 
such as "Do you know that
Wbrcfe .The cast, a versatile group, 
played their various characters 
with sin-prising grace and ease. 
Douglas Rees and Kate Young 
shone as Mr. and 
Mrs. Trotsky and 
Joe Depsey, aSec- 
ond City member, 
played a fairty 
amusing chimp.

ine three monkeys typing into Northlight Theatre, pulled the 
eternity; and you have another cast together sharply and well. 
David Ives’ play Words, Words, The only complaints I have are
concerning the sound and the 
set. A far cry from the City 
Theatre’s usually detailed and 
well-constructed sets, the 
painted flats and mildly inter­
esting perspectivesof this back­
drop seemed uncreati ve, as well 
as the sound, which was a mess 
of synthesized piano and drums. 
However, the lack of sets does 
not take away from the story or 
the actors, and it still allows 
the comedy to shine through.

THE PIZZA REVIEWS
by Jon Slenk and the Pizza Review Board
Vincent’s Pizza
This week we review pizza from Vincent’s Pizza Park on Forbes 
Ave, in Squirrel Hill. We had heard of Vincent’s from acquaintances 
before the Squirrel Hill franchise opened, and the general consensus 
was that the pizza was very good. After examining the pies we got, 
we would concur. They were, for the most part, excellent.
The pies came not in boxes, but wrapped in paper which was 
stapled to a cardboard base. I must say, I was somewhat flummoxed 
by this configuration of multiple layers of paper, but in the end, I 
prevailed and managed to get the pepperoni pie exposed. Phew!
The Pepperoni Pie
After opening the package, we took a look at the wonderfully 
aromatic pie. It was very large, considering that it was supposed to 
be a medium. It looked somewhat over cooked, which causes some 
trepidation on the part of at least one reviewer who doesn’t like the 
cheese to be browned.
Still, the pepperoni chunks (yes, big, hunking, slabs of meat) 
looked good, if quite greasy (mmm ... grease!), and we each took a 
piece and began our gastronomic evaluations.
The crust was puffy and somewhat soft. It was good if you like that 
kind of crust, which not all of us do. If you are the kind of person who 
likes to gnaw on the crust edges of slices, you’re in for a treat. The 
sauce was quite good, in a non-overpowering yet distinctly tomato- 
ey way. The cheese was plentiful and, over-cooking aside, was de- 
lish. Finally, the plentiful pepperoni was a welcome change to the 
few, anemic slices one finds on some other pies. Overall, a good pizza.
The Specialty
Another member of the Pizza Review Board opened the special 
pizza (with, I might note, significantly more aplomb than I could ever 
hope to muster,) which proved to be topped with sausage, mush­
rooms and roasted red peppers. Mmm! I’m salivating just writing 
about it! The sausage was generous, not the small kind that reminds 
one of rabbit excrement.
The mushrooms were fresh, which is always good, and the peppers 
were great. We should note that they weren’t the sweet variety, 
rather they were of the vinegary family. This isn’t bad, just perhaps 
not what one would have expected.
I think we managed to eat only two or three pieces total, each, even 
though we were all starving. The pizzas are huge! They should keep 
you and yours fed for quite a while.
On another note, we chatted with a high government official 
(whose wish to remain anonymous we will honour) who apparently 
frequented the establishment in question, and who mentioned that 
I one may ask for extra toppings (although they give you quite a lot to 
j ^gin with) generally with no extra charge. Could be true.
The Numbers
; Crust: We gave a low score of 6 and a high of 8. 
i Sauce: 8’s all ‘round.
Cheese: The low score here is an 8, the high 9.
Pepperoni: Our numerical opinions ranged from 7 to 8.
Special: Here, we thought a low of 9 and a high of 10 was in 
i order.
j Conclusion
If we do some mental calculations to get an overall numerical 
I jating for these pies, we get: 8. One of the reviewers went so far as 
; 0 say that it was the best pizza they had ever had in da ’Burgh. Damn 
&°od pizza, well worth any extra cash you might fork over for it. We’d 
Suggest, however, that since the pies were so large, you start with a 
i medium and work you way up from there.

Play: King Stag
Group: Timespace Theatre Company 
in cooperation withThe Pittsburgh Center for 
the Arts 
Admission: $8
This play is described as “an Italian fairy 
tale,” a fable of good, evil, love, hatred, re­
venge, magical powers, and slapstick comedy. 
Inherent in such a play are themes of loyalty, 
honesty, justice, and heavenly powers — good 
child-raising stuff.
I arrived at the Center, parked, and then 
was directed into a part of the main building I 
never knew existed — downstairs, following 
the occasional sign, to the basement where, 
apparently, there is a theatre.
While waiting for the house to open, I sat 
down and perused the program. The first thing 
I noticed was that the production was quite 
large in terms of the number of actors in­
volved, numbering eleven in all. They vary 
from CMU and University of Pittsburgh stu­
dents to natives of Louisville, Kentucky, to a 
visiting actress from France (who attended 
drama school in Singapore). A diverse group, 
indeed.
At the back of the program was a quick 
description of the company: “Timespace is a 
new theatre company in Pittsburgh, PA whose 
mission is to produce experimental (works 
that challenge theatrical conventions) and 
exploratory (A process by which artists in 
differing media can collaborate to establish a
common vocabulary) theatrical works.” There 
you go.
Eventually the theatre opened. We walked 
in (I’d like to note that the theatre, although 
down a small flight of stairs, is wheelchair 
accessible via a chair lift — as is, presumably, 
the entirety of the center.) to find, basically, a 
large hall of hardwood floor and steel beams. 
Not an inherently atmospheric room for a 
classical show.
Orange cables were strewn all about the 
white walls and ceiling to the fairly extensive 
lighting system. Again, not something I would 
think of being conducive to suspension of dis­
belief. The stage consisted mostly of a large 
area of bare floor, and then a raised platform 
area in back.
The story began with a monologue by 
Cigolotti (David Hugar), a student of the ma­
gician Durandarte (Matt Gaydos), describing 
King Deramo (Ben Moore) and his trusty advi­
sor Tartaglia (Eric Andrews). Kind Deramo is 
given two magic secrets by Durandarte which 
are key to the development of the tale.... I 
won’t spoil the secrets by telling you what they 
are.
The overall plot involves: the search for a 
wife by the King who, after beginning inter­
views with any and all eligible females of the 
realm, has rejected several thousand candi­
dates; the machinations of Tartaglia, driven 
by unrequited love and dreams of power; the 
unfolding of Durandarte’s predictions that his 
magical gifts to the King will be critical to the 
triumphant success of good over evil; and a 
variety of comedic subplots to keep things 
bouncing along.
“Yes,” I detect you thinking, “but where 
does the damned title come from?” Well, if 
I were to really explain it to you, I’d have 
to give away one of the magical secrets, so 
I will only say that the title is not in 
reference to some kind of royal bachelor 
party.
At first, my reaction to the production 
was that it reminded me a lot of the best 
high school productions I’ve seen. I felt a 
sense of overall detachment for quite a lot 
of the play; it seemed that the players 
were, for the most part, never fully in 
character, and that the set was just a bit 
too minimal to draw you into the world of 
kings and magic, treachery and true love.
Still, this could be due to my expecta­
tions of a more elaborate production. Had 
I gone looking for more of an intimate 
production, where one can really feel like 
the play is being put on just for you, I think 
I would have been more satisfied.
After all, this is a fairy tale, not neces­
sarily something one expects to develop 
full, three dimensional characters.
Not to detract from any of the other 
characters, but, I must say, I liked the 
parrot quite a lot. I thought it was the most 
subtly humorous character, if not the most 
dimensional.
So, in the end, if you go looking for fun, 
you can find it herein. Sit back and enjoy 
the nefarious evil character, the good and 
honest king, and the entanglements of 
everyone’s search for love.
There’s a just, even happy, ending for 
all!

Even though they are “cop­

sure of trying: to analyze the 
differences of interpretation. I 
recognized many differences in 
the paintings from those in the 
original works.
The paintings have more de­

that make them real. As to the

Fanny and Alexander
Not only is this film directed by Ingmar Bergman, 
but one of the major characters is named after a 
body part! What more could you want?! Maybe if 
both of the characters were named after body parts, 
like Fanny and Nose, then I’d really like it. I mean 
that would be great.
This film is all about a family in Sweden that 
moves quite grandly through the trials and tribula­
tions of life and love. Bergman won an Oscar for 
Best Foreign Film for this one, so it’s a pretty big 
deal. The plot is secondary, dearies, because this is 
Bergman. This ain’t your daddy’s art film, big boy.
Starring Pernilla Allwin, Ewa Froling, Erland 
Josephson, and a whole bunch of other people with 
extra or missing consonants in their names, this 
movie is super-fly TNT. See it with someone who’s 
filmed in black and white.
At 5, 8:30 pm, and midnight.
Friday, December 9
The Client
While this movie is no Pulp Fiction, it still has its 
good points. Starring Susan Sarandon and this 
little kid named Brad Renfro, this film is all about 
this little kid who sees a murder and is defended by 
Sarandon in court from nasty mafia types and a bad 
lawyer.
Based on a John Grisham novel, this has just 
enough pulp to count as sort of pulpy fiction. The 
pulp of the movie appears between the wonderful 
Sarandon and new comer Brad Renfro, and the 
chemistry is no fiction, by any stretch of the imagi­
nation.
Though this is not a true story, and therefore 
fiction, the gripping courtroom drama will keep you 
glued to your seat as if your fanny were stuck there 
by some pulpy substance. See it with someone who 
has a background in law, so he or she can keep 
making little remarks about the mistakes in the 
movie.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.
Saturday, December 10
Natural Born Killers
Starring Woody Harrelson, Robert Downey Jr., 
and Juliette Lewis, this film is not an animated 
movie about lions, but ’tis certainly a king among 
violent films, and I ain’t lion. Directed by Oliver 
Stone, evidently this is a commentary about the 
horrors of the media and a tirade on desensitiza­
tion. Or maybe it’s just a nice story about a son who 
follows in his father’s paw-steps, but I doubt that.
Violent and all funked up, this movie is disturb­
ing and wacky. In fact, Harrelson and Lewis wacky 
a lot of people during the course of the movie. They 
also shoot them.
If it’s horrible, it’s disturbing, and it hurts to 
watch, it’s gotta beNatural Born Killers. See it with 
someone who knows a lot about anatomy, so he or 
she can tell you which artery just got gouged open. 
Pulp. Fiction. Fanny.
At 5, 7, 9,11pm, and lam.
Sunday, December 11
Fire Maidens from 
Outer Space
This is the last DH2210 film of the semester, and 
evidently they wanted go out with a bang, or down 
in flames, as the title suggests. OK, here it is: guys 
go up in a space ship. They land on a moon of 
Jupiter. They find lots of women who want to get a 
piece. Hoo-yah, you got yourself one helluvah film..
Directed by some cat named Cy Young, this movie 
was made in 1955, and evidently, allowed Cy to 
exploit young women in search of movie roles. And 
exploit he did. But it’s not all that bad, and there’s 
no nudity or other bad things, so it should be kind 
of funny to see a bunch of crazy kids hamming it up 
on-screen. And who knows, you may even see a 
fanny! See it with someone... hell... I don’t care who 
you see it with.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

charming little film called Christ­

ing on later).
So, it is up to Ernest and his 
runaway jailbait sidekick (possi­
bly the only runaway j ailbait side­
kick I have ever seen in a Christ­
mas film) to save Christmas by
John Hughes’ remake of Miracle 
on 34th Street is now playing. 
Help John cash in on his latest 
money making scheme and go 
see the cute little kid! It’s des­
tined to be a hit, just like Home 
Alone, Home Alone 2, Curly Sue, 
Dennis the Menace, and Baby’sby Carey Clevenger putting on stupid costumes and Day Out. So go see it! He’ll be glad

Ho ho ho! It’s that time of the incredibly zany, madcap, and When I think of Christmas, I
year again, when all of us 
forget how wretched and 
miserable our lives are by 
buying things for our loved 
ones that we know they’ll 
most likely shove into a 
box and hide in their clos­
ets.
What’s that, you say?
Don’t have the Christmas 
spirit? Well, fear not, oh 
faithful reader! Just run 
down to your local video 
store and rent one of these 
babies, and you’ll be in the 
spirit in no time flat! Let’s 
see what ol’ Santa dragged out of 
the trash and has dumped into 
our stockings this year!
Let’s dispense with the good, 
wholesome family fare first:
The funniest thing about Ernest 
Saves Christmas isn’t the tremen­
dously intellectual plot, or the 
hysterically funny dialogue, or 
even the inspired comic acting of 
virtuoso thespian Jim Varney. 
No, I would argue that the funni­
est thing about this film is that 
anyone would bother making this 
movie, much less putting it on 
video.
The basic plot is this: Santa 
Claus is thinking about retiring, 
and is going to pass the torch to 
some new blood. However, things 
don’t go as smoothly as Saint Nick 
would have liked (the most amaz­
ing thing about this is that Ernest 
has nothing to do with the mix- 
up), and his intended successor is 
more interested in filming a

think of Christmas trees, 
mistletoe, stockings, and 
manical killers dressed in 
Santa suits. That’s right! 
What are the colors of 
Christmas? Box office dol­
lar green and bloody crim­
son red! So let’s move on to 
horror....
The first film in this 
genre is the all-time clas­
sic, Silent Night, Deadly 
Night. This movie has it 
all: parents who leave 
their young son alone for a 
few moments with his
sitcom-ish situations that the mentally deranged grandfather; 
characters constantly find them- a Santa who enjoys robbing li- 
selves involved in. quor stores, killing, and raping;
Ithinkmyroomatesaiditbest: nuns; lots of pointless sex and
“Mr. Varney certainly thinks that 
he is funny.” He apparently also 
thought that this movie was 
worth watching. Oh well, rest 
assured that someday he too will 
achieve the incredible comic tal­
ents possessed by the likes of 
Jerry Lewis.
Also worthy of note, although 
only briefly, is Santa Claus: The 
Movie, starring Dudley Moore as 
an elf, and John Lithgow as*an 
evil business man. I think the 
whole movie is some sort of meta­
phor for drug use: Lithgow spends 
the film pursuing the secrets of 
the “Magic Candy Canes” that 
allow Santa’s reindeer to fly, only 
to float into orbit after ingesting 
too many of them.
Before I move onto the good 
stuff, let me also mention that
nudity; Linnea Quigley; nuns; a 
deaf priest, who becomes a dead 
priest at the hands of an inept 
deputy; bizarre Christmas- 
themed murders (impaled on deer 
antlers, strangled with Christ­
mas lights, et cetera); nuns; an 
ending that assures you that 
there will be a part two; and a 
Catholic orphanage. There are 
also a few nuns.
In other words, there’s a little 
bit of something for everyone. 
Clearly a film for the whole fam- 
ily.
But the fun doesn’t stop there! 
In Silent Night, Deadly Night II, 
it’s time for Billy’s little brother 
Ricky to take up where his brother 
left off. I think if you sat down 
with a stopwatch you would real­
ize that the entire plot of the film
is introduced and resolved in the 
course of about 40 mintues, with 
the other 50 or so being mostly 
flashbacks to the first movie.
There are a lot of classic bits in 
this film: my favorite sequence is 
when Ricky procures a police re­
volver and goes on a “walk-by 
shooting,” causing a car to ex­
plode with one bullet to the grille.
The people responsible for these 
films apparently know that you 
can’t get too much of a good thing. 
Ricky is back again in Silent 
Night, Deadly Night Part III: 
Better Watch Out!
Although he was shot dead at 
the end of the second film, a doc­
tor has managed to “surgically 
re-form his brain,” which is now 
encased in a piece of transparent 
plexiglass.
Ricky bascially stumbles 
around through the duration of 
the film with what looks like a 
plastic spaghetti strainer on his 
head, with a few electronic gizmos 
hanging off thè back. (The funni­
est sequence has to be just after 
he escapes from the hospital: he 
walks down a rather busy street 
in his hospital gown, brain ex­
posed through the plastic casing, 
and no one seems to notice.) 
Ricky’s mission is to find the blind 
girl he has been telepathically 
communicating with.
So, until later, Merry Christ­
mas (or Happy Hanukkah) and 
Happy New Year! See you next 
semester.

Fanny and Alexander zuhfF gu WMj
By WLADIMIR LABEIKOVSKY
Tartan Staffwriter
It rarely dawns on people how hard it is to 
actually make a film, especially if it is big 
enough to not be the kind you’d make with a 
“guerrilla” crew. It is even harder to make 
good films, mainly because good ideas are 
the first to be rejected. Working with a 
number of people doesn’t help either.
So, once in a while, some directors find 
they’ve lost their patience and they just go 
on and retire, some examples are Antonioni, 
Kieslowski (rather recently), and Swedish 
cine-meister extraordinaire Ingmar 
Bergman. Bergman’s good-bye to film before 
retiring to the world of theater was Fanny 
and Alexander, an extraordinarily beautiful 
tapestry of memories, dreams, and some 
good ol’ magic.
The film begins and ends with parties. At 
the beginning we get to meet the extended 
family of Alexander and his sister Fanny, a 
delightful bunch of eccentrics who, in the 
majority, just love life big time. Alexander’s 
father is the director of a theater company
and both his wife and his mother are renowned 
actresses. Shortly after Christmas, Alexander’s 
father passes away and his mom marries a 
priest.
Fanny’s and Alexander’s lives then turn into 
a Dickensian mode and plenty of tricks, ghosts 
and even a few miracles find their way in. This 
would be an offensively short and simplistic 
synopsis, but Fanny and Alexander belongs to 
the precious genre of film that relies on the 
beauty of detail. Also, the film is structured in 
episodic form and, being quite autobiographi­
cal, at moments it feels like small vignettes of 
memories.
For this, his last film, Bergman seemed to 
abandon the nihilism and philosophical de­
spair that seized his previous and most fa­
mous works (The Silence, Persona) and to 
make a sentimental celebration of life. How­
ever, this being Bergman, we know it is not 
just that. This film can actually be considered 
as two different films, and the story as Bergman 
tells it has many layers, almost too numerous 
to mention here.
There are plenty of echoes in this film which 
is partly a family saga and partly a ghost story.
Part of the echoes come from some of 
Bergman’s own previous films. Vergerus, 
the priest, resembles the authoritative vil­
lain of Torment and Alexander’s mom em­
bodies the Bergman woman, half virgin and 
half seductress. There are also references 
from the nostalgic atmosphere on Wild 
Strawberries and the gothic myths from 
Hour of the Wolf. Although Fanny and 
Alexander is not at all a self-homage, it is 
definitely the perfect farewell from Bergman. 
He even manages to throw in a nod to the 
Bard and to Dickens which is perhaps an 
homage to storytelling itself.
The film is thus a big gathering as well, 
not only of people, but of stories. And 
Bergman’s good-bye feels more like a transi­
tion. He seems to remind us how beauty is 
immortal and how the “magic of art” saves 
us from the occasionally bleak “reality”. Thus 
the closing line of the movie (from A Dream 
Play) is more than appropriate: “Anything 
can happen, all is possible and probable.... 
On an insignificant foundation of reality, 
imagination spins out and weaves new pat­
terns.”
