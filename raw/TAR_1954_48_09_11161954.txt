S.C. Meets In Auditorium: 
Plans Bloodmobile Drive
By James J. Murphy
In an attempt to gain more seating room for both Council mem­
bers and visitors, Student Council held its last meeting in the SIA 
auditorium. Results of the experiment were successful, and Presi­
dent Miley plans to have as many future meeitngs as possible in
either the auditorium or one of*----------------------------------------------------
the SIA classrooms.
It was announced to Council 
members that this year the Red 
Cross again has available a Blood- 
mobile unit which can visit Tech 
at a later date. All student blood 
contributions would be given by 
the Red Cross to local Pittsburgh 
hospitals. Mr. Paul Pollinger was 
appointed to look into the situa­
tion, and try to schedule a con­
venient date for the Blood Bank 
visit. Any campus organizations 
interested in co-ordinating and 
publicizing the drive are requested 
to contact Mr. Pollingtr.
Elections
Council also approved Tuesday,
December 14, as the date of the 
date of the next all-school eltc- 
tion of one half the membership 
of Council, there will also be 
printed on the ballots an Amend­
ment to the Student Council Con­
stitution which is subject to ap­
proval of a majority of students 
voting in the election. Some of the 
issues which will be decided at 
the election have been enumerated 
in the November 9 issue of the 
Tartan.
Motivated by the recent edict 
of the Administrations Executive 
Board forbidding pep rallies dur­
ing class hours, Council passed a 
resolution addressed to the Exe­
cutive Board requesting that the 
control and responsibilities in 
connection with rallied be rede­
fined. While in theory the student 
government is given the power to 
“authorize all all-student rallies” 
by the Executive Board, recent 
practice of the Board has been to 
paos judgement concerning rallies 
without notifying Council either 
before or after the judgement.
In cooperation witlj the other 
student governments of the Pitts­
burgh Colleges, Council is looking 
into the possibilities of setting up 
a discount arrangement with var­
ious stores in the Oakland district.
While the plan is still in its in­
fancy, it is hoped that the com­
bined efforts of all the area col­
leges may lead to an, arrangement 
beneficial to all college students.

Reconsiders Tech 
Pep Rally Action
At a meeting of the Executive 
Board of the school held on Oct­
ober 13 action was taken that pro­
hibited any football rallies or 
victory celebrations on school 
time. A meeting of student 
was called and expressed strong 
resentment to the ruling. 
University of Pittsburgh also ob­
jected to the action because it was 
felt this might result in students 
invading other campuses and 
aggrevating the problem of con- 
troling such celebrations.
In the light of this 
Executive Board re\ 
policy on November 10 and decid­
ed that since the football 
had won all its games so far 
is Class B champion, an outburst 
after the Lehigh game seemed 
inevitable. For this reason sanc­
tion was given to the pep-rally 
held yesterday between 9:30 and 
10:30 in the gymnasium on the 
condition the students stayed on 
campus.
This action does not mean that 
it is a precedent or a commitment 
for coming years. The problem of 
preventing such celebrations from 
interfering with classes is to be 
turned over to the students and 
faculty which are studying extra­
curricular activities.

Vacation Set
The Carnegie Tech observance 
of Thanksgiving will be held on

All members of the Tech com­
munity—students, faculty, and 
other personnel—are urged to join 
in this expression of praise and 
thanksgiving to God. The observ­
ance has not been designed as a 
worship service, but rather as a 
common observance in which peo­
ple of all faiths can easily partici­

Heavily Favored Lehigh Held 
To 13-13 Tie In Season’s Finale
By Jim Lacey
They did it! For the first time in .Tartan football history the Scots went through an 
undefeated season. Tech had to settle for a 13-13 tie against the highly favored Lehigh 
team, before some 10,000 fans, the largest crowd of the season for the Plaid.
A great catch by Bill Kennedy of a John Tucci pass tied the score for Tech. With
?only five seconds to play in the 
half, Tucci faded back and hurled

Tech Chemists Find 
Atomic Aluminum
A long-lived radioactive isotope of aluminum has been discovered 
by a group of Carnegie Tech chemists under the direction of Asso­
ciation Professor Truman P. Kohman. The new isotope now makes 
possible the application of isotopic tracing to all known chemical 
elements. ? 1 — ¦

was thi only element not favored 
with an isotope suitable for con­
ducting tracer experiments. All 
previously known radioactive iso­
topes of aluminum have lifetimes 
of only a few minutes at most. 
The new isotope has a half-life of 
about a million years, and is call­
ed aluminum 26v The ordinary 
metal used for construction ma­
terial and household utensils is 
known as aluminum 27.
By means of isotopic tracing, 
aluminum 26 can be used in 
studying the properties of alumi­
num and its chemical compounds 
and in gaining new information 
about the processes in which 
aluminum is formed. Isotopic 
tracing is one of the valuable tools 
contributed to science and tech­
nology by the atomic age. An iso­
tope is one of several forms of an 
element which differs physically 
but is chemically similar to other 
forms of the same element.
Tracing Technique Important
A radioactive isotope can be 
singled out because of its radia­
tions and traced through chemical 
and physical changes. The tracing 
technique has contributed im­
mensely to scientific knowledge 
in chemistry, biology, medicine, 
and metallurgy, and has led to the 
improvements of many industrial

Frank Wenzgryn, a junior in the chemical engineering depart­
ment, was picked on Colliers' pro scouting list this summer. Presently 
a tackle for the Tartans. Frank received offers from the Philadelphia 
Eagles and the Cleveland Browns as a result of this article.
Wenzgryn counts membership in* 
the AIChE, Newman Club, C-Club, j 
and on intramural basketball and \ 
varsity football and track teams 
among his activities here at Tech. 
Frank participated in football, 
baseball, basketball, and track in 
high school, earning a grand total 
of 13 letters in these sports. He 
has been a member of the All 
Tri-State team for the past two 
years, and was a member of the 
All-Westinghouse Valley and All 
Westmoreland County teams in 
high school.
Safety Play
Frank’s biggest moment occurred 
in a safety play during this year’s i 
Lafayette game. Lafayette had the 
ball on the four yard line, and j 
Wenzgryn tackled the QB. but did 
not realize it was a safety until he 
saw the referee with his arms in 
the air.
Wenzgryn attributes our excel- j 
lent season record, and particu­
larly, our showing against Lehigh, 
to “the squad, who felt confident 
about the games,"’ and to “the

Ed Karcher
Ed Karcher. guard for the Tar­
tan squad, is a junior electrical 
engineer. An alumnus of Carrick 
High School, where he played 
three years of football, swam for 
a year, and spent a year on the 
track team, JEd is a holder of four 
letters* in high school athletics. 
Here at Tech, he is a member of 
| the Varsity C-Club, treasurer of 
his fraternity, and a participant in 
intramural volleyball, water polo, 
bowling, and, in the near future, 
basketball. In the past three years, 
Ed has earned three letters in 
football and two in track.
Big Moments 
Ed’s first big moment in college 
football occurred during his fresh­
man year at Tech, when he inter- 
: cepted a pass in the Bethany game 
! and came within five yards of a . 
! TD. Ed also recalls the city league 
j championship games which his 
high school lost to Henry Ford by 
j a score of 6-0. -
Karcher feels that there’s a big

Winner Of DU-KS 
Game Meets ATO 
For School Title
The Tartan league finally got 
straightened out, as the playoff 
of the three way tie that had re­
sulted was finished last Wednes­
day with ATO emerging as the 
winner.
In the first game SAE lost to 
ATO 22-9, after putting up a 
spirited fight for the first two 
quarters. SAE, it might be noted, 
played without the services of 
their quarterback Mike Fedor, 
and two other first string players. 
In Tuesday’s encounter, the SAE’s 
were romped by the KS’s, who 
really looked like the team to beat 
in the finals.
Wednesday afternoon, Bartocci 
and company started off like a 
“house on fire” and looked as 
though they would give the KS’s 
some of their own medicine. They 
had the KS’s on the run. There 
was an uncalled for flair up of 
tempers by the KS’s who settled 
down in the second half to play 
a good brand of ball, but time 
ran out in favor of the ATO’s, who 
were protecting their early lead. 
The final score: ATO’s 25, KS’s 24.
Playoff Games v
In the battle of the second 
place teams, the TX’s took the 
measure of the SN’s by the score 
of 30-20, and earned themselves 
the right to meet ATO in the 
semi-finals.
The other quarter-final game 
found the Delts meeting the 
KS’s, with KS coming from 
behind in the second half to win 
this one, 26-20. This was a 
battle of the lighter Delt team, 
with its “basketball” style of­
fense, against the strong ground 
game of „the KS’s. The bruising 
KS’s were just a little too much 
for the Delts in the second half, 
and rushed the Delt passer Ken 
Laughery, who had been running 
loose in the backfield A the first 
half. Putting up a man-to-man de­
fense, they put an end to the Delt 
shenanigans.
In the first game of the semi­
finals ATO was hard pressed to 
beat a tricky TX team. The ATO’s, 
who were praying for a bright 
moon, rushed the game to get it in 
before it became too dark. Time 
ran out on the “cloak and dagger 
men” from TX, and as the 
shadows lengthened and the moon 
rose, the /game ended with the 
ATO’s out in front 16-11.

[Continued from page 1] 
that the score was a good indica-is 
tion of the battle. Tech led in first 
downs 12 to 10 and in net yards 
266 to 254. With Tech’s charging 
line, Tom Gloede had little time, to 
pass and connected on only three 
of 15 tosses for only 41 yards, far 
from his record breaking perform­
ances in past games.
Seniors Bow Out
A quartet of Tartans stood out 
Saturday afternoon, although all 
the players played great games, 
making superlative plays when 
they had to.
Three of the four backs played 
their last game in Tartan plaid, 
due to graduation. Diminutive 
Eddie Miller gave the crowd a 
performance to remember him by, 
both offensively and defensively. 
He tallied once, lugged the ball 20 
times for 104 yards, batted down 
a number of Gloede’s passes, in­
tercepted another and was gener­
ally annoying to the Lehigh team.
Phil Jeske “saved the day” 
many times with his brilliant de­
fensive work. He covered pass re­
ceivers, batted down Gloede’s 
passes, and stole the ball from a 
.Lehigh ballcarrier when the en­
gineers from Bethlehem threat­
ened. His calling of offensive play* 
was effective, not to mention his 
own pass to Eddie Miller for the 
first tally. Bill Kennedy made the 
catch of the year as he leaped high 
into the air taking the ball away 
fr.om a Lehigh defender.
And then there was freshman 
John Tucci, who calmly stepped 
back and heaved the long pass W 
Kennedy for the tying points. All 
these were stars, but so were the 
linemen, the unsung heroes, the 
“Seven Stubborn Scots”: Frank 
Wenzgryn, Ed Karcher, A1 Schell, 
John Williamson, John McCarthy, 
Don Hrosik, and substitute end, 
fiery Art McGuigan, who played 
for Ken Ficery.
The only sad note of the day wa* 
the injury to Frank Wenzgryn, 
who broke his leg on the next 
last play of the game. He wa* 
taken to Shadyside Hospital.

School Announces 
New Building Plans
The large lectuie hall in Porter Hall which is being remodeled 
is near completion, Mr. H. R. Patton, controller, announced last Fri­
day. Out-of-date furnishings, lighting and seating are being replaced 
in PH 104 and the final result will be somewhat similar to Breed 
Memorial Hall in MMCC. ?---------------------------------------------------
Alumni Get 
Service A wards
Also planned for construction in 
the near future are a library, a 
student union, and an athletic 
field. The building plans are be­
ing delayed « through lack of 
funds, but the administration 
hopes to be able to solicit suf­
ficient contributions from the 
alumni.
Luxurious Student Union
The present Carnegie Union lo­
cated on Forbes Street will be re­
placed by the new $1,500,000 stu­
dent union. Larger and more mod­
ern than the present building, the 
new union will include lounge 
and game rooms, the WRCT 
broadcasting station, post office, 
organization and committee 
rooms, bookstore and offices for 
student publications. A campus 
food service will replace the Ski- 
bo cafeteria. The present Carnegie 
Union will probably be converted 
into housing for students.
A central library is being plan­
ned to relieve the crowded con­
ditions at the main branch. The 
departmental libraries at EH, 
MMCC, and Fine Arts will remain 
as they are now.
The hill on which the graduate 
dorms are now situated will be 
used to 1-aise the level of the Tech 
bowl 20 feet to provide for an 
athletic field. The ground floor 
of the new men's dorm located 
dn Margaret Morrison Street will 
serve as a field house for the new 
stadium, the funds for which are 
being supplied by an alumni 
project. The administration hoiJes 
that the new plans will win stu­
dent support for the Tech team. 
In the event of no large donations 
in the near future, the athletic 
field will be placed first on the 
program.

Carnegie YMCA- 
YWCA To Sponsor 
Annual Retreat
Faith, sex, and love will be the 
subjects for discussion at the Car­
negie Tech joint YMCA-YWCA 
retreat which will be held this 
Saturday and Sunday at Camp 
Carondowanna. Marjorie Penney 
*and' Wayne Smith, co-chairmen for 
the retreat, have announced that 
Mr. and Mrs. Samuel Gibson will 
direct two of the discussion groups. 
Mr. Gibson is the new coordinator 
of religious activities on the Tech 
campus.
This weekend’s retreat topic is 
also the main topic that will be 
considered at the National “Y” 
Assembly in Kansas during the 
Christmas holidays. It is the con­
viction of the “Y” groups that faith 
in God and the sexual life are very 
closely related; and that in turn, 
the meaning of love ajid the mean­
ing of sex can throw real light on 
one another.
Elaine Paul, Steve Rowley, and 
Louie Marquet are assisting the 
co-chairmen -in preparing for the 
retreat. A unique program of rec­
reation has been planned and fun 
is promised for all. Attendance is 
open to all Tech students. Reser­
vations can be sent by intra-school 
mail to Marjorie Penney, More- 
wood Gardens 2B1 or to Mr. Gib­
son, Carnegie Union. The dead­
line is tomorrow evening.
Those attending will leave the 
campus at .noon Saturday and 
return at 6:00 Sunday evening, fol­
lowing the closing of the retreat by 
the Rev. Oliver Stang of McKees­
port.

Has S. Goldberg 
As Featured Solo
Szymon Goldberg, Polish vio­
linist, will be the soloist with the 
Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra 
this Friday evening and Sunday 
afternoon at Syria Mosque. He 
will be heard in two Concerti, both 
of which are being performed for 
the first time at these concerts. 
They are Haydn’s Concerto in C 
major for violin and string orches­
tra and Hindemith’s Violin Con­
certo No. 3.
Goldberg made his debut here 
in 1947 as soloist with the New 
York Philharmonic Symphony Or­
chestra. He has since appeared 
with most of the principal sym­
phonies and in all of the leading 
festivals. His only appearance in 
Pittsburgh was as soloist with the 
orchestra during the 1952 Inter­
national Contemporary Music Fes­
tival.
In addition to the two concerti, 
William Steinberg will conduct the 
Orchestra in the lively “Cochaigne” 
(In London Town) Overture by 
Elgar and Mozart’s Symphony No. 
36, which is known as the Linz 
Symphony because it was com­
posed in the upper Austrian capital 
of Linz.

Letters—
Football Hit
Editor, the Tartan:
I felt your recent editorial on 
the responsibility of each man and 
each fraternity in the intramurals 
very sound, but it had a very short 
lasting effect on the participants. 
During a recent football game one 
of the linemen disagreed with the 
call of the referee and punched 
him. Can anyone call this overt 
action good sportsmanship, a 
credit to our intramural set up 
or fo Carnegie? This is not the 
first of such actions on the field 
of a supposedly organized game.
A pat on the hand by the 
Tartan editorial is not enough. I 
feel that if something concrete is 
not done there will be serious 
injuries and a complete break­
down of the good clean intra­
murals we are all proud of here 
at Carnegie Tech.
I feel the games get out of 
control, and a possible solution, 
especially in the play-off games, 
would be to have members of the 
Intramural <Staff in charge there 
at the game. Along with this, 
better training and selection of 
the officials who take charge of 
the games. Perhaps more severe 
penalties for violators, including 
forfeiting of games. Whatever it 
is, action is necessary to control 
spectacles such as what went on 
Wednesday afternoon.
This is a serious matter. At 
Amhurst College, for one, they 
had a recent death caused by head 
injuries suffered in a intramural 
game of touch football. They now 
require helmets for head protec­
tion in every game. A possible 
suggestion here for the old varsity 
helmets.

DECEMBER AND MAY: ACT II
Synopsis of Act I: A middle-aged English Professor named Phipps has fallen desperately in love with a rosy-kneed coed named Mc­Fetridge. Phipps doesn’t know how to go about courting Miss McFetridge, for, after all, he is a professor in the-autumn of his life, and she is a coed with rosy knees. Professor Twonkey, who shares an office with Phipps, proposes the following plan: Phipps will ask Miss McFetridge to come to his office for a conference late in the afternoon. He will be urbane and charming and make fright­fully witty remarks about English lit, and Miss McFetridge will laugh and laugh. After an hour of this high-type hilarity, Phipps will look at his watch, exclaim at the lateness of the hour, and insist on driving Miss McFetridge home. On the way home, he will pass a theatre that shows French movies. They’ll see the movie, then have an exquisite French dinner, and Miss McFetridge will be so enchanted 
that she cannot but yield to his suit.
So at the beginning of Act II, we find Phipps in his office awaiting the arrival of the poor young innocent. His hair is brushed; his nails are clean; he has new leather patches on his elbows. There is a knock on the door. He opens it and admits a gorgeous creature with 
blue eyes and pink kneecaps.
Phipps: Ah, Miss McFetridge. Come in, my dear. Won’t you sit 
down? Cigarette?
Miss McF: Ooh, Philip Morris! I think they’re marvy, don’t you?
Phipps : I do indeed.
Miss McF: Hey, prof, would you mind opening a fresh pack?
Phipps: But I just opened this one a little while ago. It’s perfectly fresh.
Miss proc I know, prof, but I like to hear the snap when the 
pack opens.
Phipps: Very well, my dear.(He opens a fresh snap-open pack of Philip Morris. Miss McFetridge claps her hands delightedly when she hears the snap.)
Miss proc Hey, that fractures me! Man, I flip when I hear that crazy snap! Do another one.
Phipps: All right.(He snaps open another pack of Philip Morris)
Miss McF: (Ecstatically) Isn’t that the living, breathing end? Do two at once.
Phipps: Well, if you insist. . .(He'does two at once)
Miss McF: More! More!
Phipps : I’m afraid that’s all I have.
Miss McF: Oh . . . Well, what’s up, prof? What did you want to see me about?
Phipps: Oh, nothing in particular. Just wanted to have a little chat, find out how you’re enjoying the Shakespeare lectures.
Miss McF: I don’t know, prof. By me Shakespeare is strictly a square.
Phipps: Indeed? Well, I must say I find your attitude refreshing. One is so inclined toward slavish admiration when it comes to the Bard. People forget that in many quarters Shakespeare is regarded quite critically. Take, for example, the opinion of Shaw.
Miss McF: Artie?
Phipps: George Bernard...You know, of course, his famous words.
Miss McF: I sure don’t, dad.
Phipps: Shaw said he would like to dig up Shakespeare and throw stones at him.
Miss proc Did he dig him?
Phipps: No, I don’t believe so.
Miss pro : I don’t dig him either.
Phipps: (Looking at watch) Good heavens, I had no idea it wu so late. Come, my dear, I’ll drive you home.
Miss McF: No, thanks. I always walk home. It’s good for the circulation in your legs. I got the best circulation in my legs of the whole sophomore class. Ever notice how rosy my knees are?
Phipps: Asa matter of fact, yes ... Look, you sure you don’t want a ride home? There’s an excellent French movie on the way.
Miss McF: Not me, dad. I hate French pictures. The sub-titles always disappear before I can read ’em. But if you want to go to the 
movies, there’s a new Tony Curtis pieture downtown — a real gut- buster. Tony plays this beggar, see, but he’s really a prince onlv he doesn’t know it on account of his sneaky uncle who switched babies when Tony got born. Then Tony finds this magic lamp, see, and he gets into the palace where he meets this crazy girl, only she’s engaged to the fake prince, but then they have this mad sword fight, and Tony licks about a million guys, and then he finds out he’s the prince and it’s real crazy. Wanna go? I’ve only seen it three or four times.
Phipps: As a matter of fact, I just remembered a previous en­gagement. Sorry.
Miss McF: That’s all right. Thanks for the Philip Morris. ’Bye.
(Exit Miss McFetridge. For a moment Phipps sit* in stunned silence, mopping his brow. Then a smile appears on his face.He is a happy mai^again-out of love. Contentedly he lights up a Philip Moms.)

Held For Army- 
Bound Vie Sabol
As most everyone knows by now, 
one of our esteemed colleagues, 
Vic Sabol, has been requested to 
accompany Uncle Sam on a “two- 
year vacation.” Being that Vic is 
So “anxiously’’ awaiting this ‘va­
cation’ (definite departure date un­
known), a group of his friends got 
their heads together and decided 
to give him a rousing send-off. A 
party was held on Sunday even­
ing, November 7, 1954 in Parish 
Hill Ludge at North Park. Those 
present included: Edna Thorwart, 
Elvira Loreski, Kathy Galligan, 
Emily Muhic, Shirley Sloan, Do­
lores Iseff, Walt Bachmayer, Bill 
Bond, John Elias, Frank Polma, 
Ray Schwalm, and Bill and Do­
lores Groll,
There were many games played. 
Several of these games were in 
contest form, with first prize be­
ing the next dance with the guest 
of honor—providing, of course, 
that the winner was a girl. Besides 
games, there was dancing, and re­
freshments. Towards the end of 
the evening, everyone gathered 
around and serenaded Vic. Shirley 
Sloan had written a poem especial­
ly for this occasion. After Shirley 
had read her poem, they presented 
Vic with a few gifts: a handker­
chief to cry in and a pen with 
which to write. As a loyal and 
true Techite and Pittsburgher, 
Vic’s parting words were “I shall 
return!”

Error
In last week’s Super Snoop-, 
er column it was stated that 
the Tech Wives Club would 
hold their meeting on Tuesday 
evening, November 9. This is 
incorrect. The meetings are 
held on the first Monday of 
every month. The next meet­
ing will be held on Monday 
evening, December 6, 1954. All 
members are urged to attend. 
On December 13, 1954, a
Christmas party for the chil­
dren will be held. There will 
be further information about 
this at a later date.
‘Of Mice And Men5 
Now At Playhouse
“Of Mice and Men,” the third 
production of the season at the 
Craft Avenue Theater, opens on 
Thursday, November 18, 1954.
This play, which was first pro­
duced on Broadway in 1937, was 
awarded the Drama Critics’ Circle 
Award.
This is the story of George and 
Lennie. George is a short, wiry, 
smart man and Lennie is a big 
powerful simple-minded man who 
sticks to George as a dumb dog 
would -to its master. In the leading 
roles are Edward Komperda as 
George and George Quinn as 
Lennie.
All To Wear Skirts 
At Kiltie Formal
On Saturday night, November
20, the Kilties will hold their an­
nual formal in the girl’s gym. This 
formal is open to all members of 
the concert and marching bands 
and their dates.
One of the interesting and un­
usual features of this dance is 
that the men will wear formal at­
tire from the waist up only; from 
the waist down they will wear 
their official kiltie uniform. This 
is the uniform that the concert 
band wears while giving a per­
formance. The girls will wear 
formais.
The kiltie formal is the only 
band-sponsored activity -given 
throughout the year with the ex­
ception of their annual banquet.
