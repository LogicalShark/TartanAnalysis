Professor Andrzej 
Strojwas, Carnegie Mel-
lon’s Joseph F. and Nancy 
Keithley Professor of Elec-
trical and Computer Engi-
neering, has been award-
ed the 2016 Phil Kaufman 
Award for Distinguished 
Contributions to Electron-
ic System Design (EDA). 
The EDA award was estab-
lished by the Electronic 
System Design Alliance 
to honor significant con-
tributions to the area of 
electronic design.
Strojwas, an immigrant 
from Poland and a 
Carnegie Mellon gradu-
ate, received the award for 
“his pioneering research in 
the area of design for man-
ufacturing in the semicon-
ductor industry,” accord-
ing to a university press 
release. He has been chief 
technologist of PDF Solu-
tions since 1997 and has 
served in a variety of oth-
er companies, including 
AT&T Bell Laboratories 
and Texas Instruments. 
He has also received many 
other awards for his pub-
lications and was elected 
IEEE Fellow in 1990.
Much of the significance 
of his work centers around 
the design of semiconduc-
tor chips, allowing their 
manufacturing in fabrica-
tion labs (also known as 
fabs) to be more efficient 
and less costly. He played 
a key role in integrating 
the design and manufac-
turing of chips, processes 
which were previously 
mostly separate. Many 
modern chip designs are 
based heavily on research 
work Strojwas and his 
group have done.
“When we started 
our research, design and 
manufacturing were 
two disjoint areas and 
very limited information 
was exchanged between 
the chip designers and 
Integrated Circuit (IC) fab-
rication engineers,” Stro-
jwas said in an interview 
with The Tartan.
He and some colleagues 
realized that, besides con-
trolling fab contamina-
tion and defects, design 
issues also contributed to 
the semiconductor yield. 
Thus, it was possible to 
systematically model the 
semiconductor yield and 
test the results. His re-
search also yielded infor-
mation about methods of 
testing wafers that saved 
time and money. These

On Friday, Jan. 27, 
President Trump signed an 
executive order halting the 
U.S. refugee resettlement 
program for 120 days, put-
ting an end to the resettling 
of Syrian refugees in the U.S. 
indefinitely, and banning 
citizens of seven predomi-
nantly Muslim countries in 
the Middle East and North 
Africa (Iran, Iraq, Libya, 
Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and 
Yemen) from entering the 
United States.
A federal judge 
temporarily stopped enforce-
ment of much of the contro-
versial counter-terrorism 
executive action on Friday, 
Feb. 3. Judge James Robart 
instructed the government 
to no longer ban individu-
als from the seven countries 
from entering the U.S., and 
the refugee bans were un-
done as well. Even the sec-
tion of the executive order 
that instructed the govern-
ment to give preference to 
religious minorities when 
selecting refugees was halted 
by the restraining order. This 
is a temporary measure that 
will remain in place until the 
court system makes a more 
definite ruling.
Several high-ranking 
Carnegie Mellon University 
officials reacted to the exec-
utive order via emails to the 
campus community. Presi-
dent Subra Suresh wrote 
about how his personal expe-
riences as an immigrant lead 
him to support Carnegie Mel-
lon’s international students 
through university policies. 
“We will do all that is within 
our power, as individuals, as 
an institution, and by work-
ing through national organi-
zations such as the Associa-
tion of American Universities 
and with federal, state and 
local officials, to support 
our international students 
and scholars to the fullest 
extent possible,” President 
Suresh wrote. Carnegie Mel-
lon’s president also prom-
ised to create a community 
forum and support group to 
discuss issues relevant to im-
migration and international 
students at Carnegie Mellon.
Provost Farnam Jahanian 
and Dean of Students Gina 
Casalegno also wrote a let-
ter to the Carnegie Mellon 
community, pledging that 
the university will offer sup-
port and assistance to inter-
national students who are 
affected by changes in the 
immigration policy. Helen 
Wang, the Director of Resi-
dential Education, emailed 
students promising that 
Carnegie Mellon will con-
tinue to be an inclusive and 
accepting home. “No mat-
ter where you hail, what 
your beliefs, where your 
frustrations/anger/fear/
hurt comes from, you have 
a place and a home with us,” 
Wang wrote.
The Office of 
International Education 
has been posting regular 
updates on its news page, 
which includes the recom-
mendation that citizens of 
the seven countries includ-
ed in the executive order 
should not travel outside of 
the U.S. due to the “ongoing 
legal uncertainties.”
To get a better 
understanding of the policy 
changes, The Tartan spoke 
with Brian Kovak, Assistant 
Professor of Economics and 
Public Policy at Carnegie 
Mellon University’s Heinz 
College, who researches 
and teaches courses on 
immigration policy.
Professor Kovak noted 
that “there’s quite a bit of 
historical precedent for 
presidents using executive 
actions to either strengthen 
or defer immigration policy 
enforcement.” President 
Jimmy Carter temporarily 
restricted certain types of 
travel from Iran to the U.S. 
during the hostage crisis 
of 1979–1981, and Presi-
dent Obama used executive 
power to more thoroughly 
vet Iraqi immigrants and 
refugees, but Kovak claimed 
that Trump’s executive order 
is “certainly unprecedented 
in the modern era in terms 
of its scope.”
So why were these seven 
countries selected for the 
ban? It appears that the 
countries were taken from a 
2015 list put together by Con-
gressional Republicans and 
the Obama administration’s 
Department of Homeland 
Security. Since 2015, citizens 
of the countries on the list 
have been required to obtain 
a visa to enter the U.S., even 
if they also have passports.
Would these immigration 
and refugee restrictions 
make the U.S. more or less 
safe? Kovak thinks that “on 
balance, it’ll have a mini-
mal effect” Kovak pointed 
out that “No one from the 
seven countries listed has 
been arrested on terrorism 
charges in the years since 
9/11. No one from those 
countries was involved in 
the 9/11 attacks.” Further, 
Kovak believes that the 
existing vetting procedures 
for refugees and immigrants 
are “quite extensive”, so 
an outright ban would not 
significantly reduce risk.
Jonathan Caulkins, a 
Heinz College professor who 
studies counter-terrorism 
policy, also believes that 
the executive order would 
“not make a huge differ-
ence either way.” Caulkins 
dismissed concerns that 
the policy would offend 
the Iraqi government, the 
United States’ ally in the 
fight against ISIS, saying 
that most Iraqis probably al-
ready have their mind made 
up one way or the other 
about the United States, 
and this policy wouldn’t do 
much to change that. Kovak 
disagreed, saying that the 
immigration ban “may gen-
erate a breakdown of inter-
national relations between 
our government and the gov-
ernments of allied countries, 
such as that in Iraq” which 
could reduce cooperation 
and “make us substantially 
less safe.”
As for the prediction made 
by Senators John McCain (R-
AZ) and Lindsey Graham (R-
SC) that the executive order 
would facilitate terrorist 
recruitment, Caulkins and 
Kovak are both doubtful that 
the policy will have a large 
effect on ISIS’ ability to gain 
followers.
If you are passionate 
about immigration policy 
and would like to voice your 
opinion, Kovak recommends 
the following for students 
who are eligible to vote in 
the U.S.: Register to vote in 
advance of the 2018 mid-
term elections and call your 
representatives in Congress. 
For students registered to 
vote on campus, contact 
Senator Robert Casey (D-
PA), Senator Pat Toomey 
(R-PA), and Congressman 
Mike Doyle (D-PA). Make 
sure to list your name and 
address of your voter regis-
tration so that the politician 
knows that you are his/her 
constituent.
For international students 
who might be personally 
affected by changes in im-
migration policy, Kovak en-
courages you to share your 
story on social media and/
or contact a reporter about 
your experiences.

For the 21 and over 
crowd, getting a drink at a 
bar on Friday or Saturday 
nights tends to be the norm 
to unwind after a long week. 
What first starts out as an ef-
fort to relax can quickly turn 
bothersome while dealing 
with long lines at crowded 
bars. To combat this prob-
lem, a group of Carnegie 
Mellon students have re-
cently launched a mobile 
ordering app called Refill 
which will allow users to 
skip this process and easily 
order and pay for drinks on 
their phones.
The app was first 
conceived after Ian Glasner, 
a 2016 graduate of Tepper 
Business School and Carn-
egie Institute of Technology, 
and a friend were excited to 
catch up over a few drinks 
at a bar in San Francisco. 
After waiting over 15 min-
utes to place their orders, 
they found themselves get-
ting frustrated and chose to 
leave. The pair decided not 
to let go of this experience 
but rather work to prevent it 
from happening to countless 
other people. After spending 
hours discussing this issue, 
they realized that, with the 
help of a few other Carnegie 
Mellon students skilled in 
design and engineering, they 
could develop an app to help 
avoid it.
Refill allows customers 
to search through the vari-
ous choices on the bar’s 
menu to conveniently order 
drinks on their phone. The 
user is able to see a timeline 
of when their order is being 
prepared (including who is 
making the order) to when 
it is ready. Each order has 
its own code which makes it 
easy to retrieve. According 
to Glasner, this simple pro-
cess means that “there’s no 
wait, no line, and no shout-
ing above the din of the bar 
to get an order across. The 
entire experience takes place 
in the app.”
Due to the efficiency 
of using an app to place 
CMU students launch Re?ll, a mobile app used to order drinks

Experts argue that terrorism research should not be driven by political agendas
Arti?cial intelligence experts propose new regulations to be used on driverless cars
Two arti?cial intelligence 
experts argue that current 
safety regulations for driver-
less cars are ill-equipped to 
ensure that these vehicles 
will perform in a safe and 
reliable manner. Their solu-
tion is to have regulations be 
performed for these vehicles 
in phases similar to the drug 
approval process.
David Danks, the L.L. 
Thurstone Professor of Phi-
losophy and Psychology and 
head of the Department of 
Philosophy, and Alex John 
London, professor of philoso-
phy and director of the Cen-
ter for Ethics and Policy in 
Dietrich College, published 
their opinions in an article 
for the Institute of Electrical 
and Electronics Engineers’ 
Intelligent Systems.
“Self-driving cars and 
autonomous systems are rap-
idly spreading through ev-
ery part of society, but their 
successful use depends on 
whether we can trust and 
understand them,” Danks said 
in a university press release. 
“We, as a society, need to 
?nd new ways to monitor 
and guide the development 
and implementation of these 
autonomous systems.”
In order to understand 
how the vehicles will act in 
various situations, Danks 
and London propose that this 
regulatory process begin with 
testing the vehicle in simulat-
ed environments with differ-
ent landscapes and climates. 
If successful, the system will 
be able to move on to being 
tested in real-world environ-
ments with a trained human 
driver. As performance goals 
are continuously met, the ve-
hicles will not have as many 
restrictions.
“Autonomous vehicles 
have the potential to save lives 
and increase economic pro-
ductivity. But these bene?ts 
won’t be realized unless the 
public has credible assurance 
that such systems are safe and 
reliable,” London said in the 
press release.

In an article published in 
Science Policy Forum, four 
experts from different ?elds 
propose that terrorism re-
search should be theoreti-
cally informed and inclusive 
to all disciplines in line with 
policy-making. This proposal 
seeks to protect the academ-
ic research from political 
interference and protect pol-
icymakers from having sim-
plistic academic accounts.
This strategy, proposed in 
an article titled “Challenges 
in Researching Terrorism 
From the Field,” was written 
by Carnegie Mellon’s own 
Baruch Fischhoff, a decision 
scientist, Scott Atran, an an-
thropologist at the Centre 
National de la Recherche 
Scienti?que in Paris, Robert 
Axelrod, a political scientist 
from the University of Michi-
gan, and Richard Davis, a 
former White House policy 
adviser now at the Univer-
sity of Oxford. The authors 
believe that terrorism re-
search would bene?t from a 
national institutional review 
board which would ensure 
the ethical standing of the 
work and that science, not 
politics, guided its funding.
“Bridging theory and 
practice is always challeng-
ing, and particularly when 
diverse forms of expertise 
are needed, and the people 
who have it lack opportuni-
ties, and perhaps incentives, 
for collaboration,” Fischhoff, 
the Howard Heinz University 
Professor in CMU’s Institute 
for Politics and Strategy and 
Department of Engineer-
ing and Public Policy, said 
in a university press release. 
“Research that overcomes 
these barriers is a hallmark 
of Carnegie Mellon and of 
the projects featured in our 
article. It is essential if the 
social sciences are to make 
their essential contributions 
to the fundamentally hu-
man problems that terrorism 
re?ects and represents.”

North Korea “test-?res” their missiles
INTERNATIONAL NEWS IN BRIEF
Relations soften between the U.S. and Turkey
ANKARA — Despite his 
historic disdain for western 
insensitivity toward Islam, 
Turkish President Recep 
Tayyip Erdogan has not 
openly criticized President 
Trump since he has taken 
of?ce. After a meeting with 
CIA head Mike Pompeo and 
a phone call with President 
Trump, of?cials from both 
nations seem highly opti-
mistic about the future of 
relations. Experts expect 
Turkey will convince Trump 
to reverse Obama-era poli-
cies that soured relations. 
Speci?cally, Obama  re-
fused to extradite religious 
leader Fethullah Gulen 
whom Turkey blames for 
last year’s coup attempt.
Slovenia offers to host talk between Putin and Trump
MOSCOW — Russian 
President Vladimir Putin 
announced on Friday that 
Slovenian President Borut 
Pahor has offered capital 
city Ljubliana as a meeting 
place for initial talks between 
President Trump and Putin. 
Putin has come out in sup-
port of the possibility, hop-
ing to fully restore relations 
between Russia and the U.S. 
American sources have not 
yet responded to the proposi-
tion. Not only is Slovenia the 
birthplace of First Lady Mela-
nia Trump, but they also host-
ed Putin’s ?rst meeting with 
President Bush in 2001 where 
Bush famously remarked that 
Putin’s eyes gave him a “sense 
of his soul.”
WASHINGTON — Early 
Sunday morning, North 
Korea “test-?red” a missile 
into the Sea of Japan, its 
?rst missile test since Presi-
dent Trump took of?ce. Ac-
cording to South Korean 
of?cials, it was most likely 
an intermediate-range Mu-
sudan-class missile, not an 
Intercontinental Ballistic 
Missile. Of?cials from the 
White House have said that 
the U.S. will not escalate 
tensions. Instead, the ad-
ministration is committed to 
strengthening alliances with 
surrounding nations. This 
show of force comes just 
days after President Trump 
con?rmed his commitment 
to the ‘One China’ Policy.

I-Corps and CMU seek to create jobs in PA
JAMES WHEATON
Staffwriter
On Feb. 9, Mike Doyle, 
the U.S. representative for 
Pennsylvania’s 14th con-
gressional district, spoke to 
a packed crowd in Margaret 
Morrison Hall. Doyle used 
this platform to discuss how 
he and other Democratic 
representatives planned on 
fighting President Donald 
Trump with regards to is-
sues most important to 
them today.
Doyle began his speech 
by discussing healthcare, 
a hot topic over which 
Republicans and Democrats 
have butted heads for many 
years, ever since the passing 
of Medicare and Medicaid 
in 1965. The reason that it is 
such a topic of debate now 
is due to the Patient Protec-
tion and Affordable Care 
Act, often shortened to ACA 
and nicknamed Obamacare. 
Instituted in 2010, in the 
midst of Obama’s Democrat-
ic presidency, the ACA made 
healthcare available to 
people who were previously 
unable to afford healthcare. 
This was heavily contested 
by Republicans. Doyle said 
that he and many other 
Democrats did not initially 
support the ACA, preferring 
instead to strengthen the 
preexisting Medicare and 
Medicaid systems.
This reaction to ACA 
shows that attempts at bi-
partisanship were denied 
by the Republicans ever 
since Obama took office. 
This time around, with a 
Republican president, Doyle 
warned that if the Republi-
can representatives wanted 
help they shouldn’t expect 
any, saying that “if [Repub-
licans] want to repeal the 
Affordable Care Act, [they] 
own it. Good luck.”
Doyle then spoke about 
some of the steps citizens 
could take to fight the cur-
rent administration, if they 
believed in that cause. One 
of the most important roles 
that he stressed was de-
veloping what he called 
a “farm team,” a group of 
passionate individuals will-
ing to work hard to run for 
elected positions in their 
local government. Doyle 
joked, “you don’t start your 
political career as a U.S. 
Senator.” He emphasized 
how valuable it was to have 
a group of supporters that 
were willing to work at the 
lower levels if they were go-
ing to rebuild their political 
party.
Something else that 
Doyle insisted would be 
beneficial for the Demo-
cratic party was to re-elect 
Tom Wolf, the current 
Pennsylvania governor. In 
a state government that 
is currently dominated by 
the Republican party, hav-
ing a democrat in a posi-
tion of power will help in-
crease the influence of the 
Democratic party. However, 
throughout his talk, he 
remained insistent that his 
party should not lose sight 
of its ideals and become 
overly radicalized, stating 
“let’s not be the Democratic 
version of the Tea Party.”
Doyle also talked about 
an issue that he felt was 
inhibiting the Democratic 
party’s ability to influence 
politics in modern Ameri-
ca: gerrymandering. Ger-
rymandering is the rear-
rangement of district lines 
in order to change the out-
come of election results. 
Doyle felt that Republicans 
had rearranged the district 
lines in Pennsylvania so that 
the substantial Democratic 
population around the Pitts-
burgh area was isolated 
mainly into one district.
After his speech, Doyle 
opened the lecture hall to 
the audience for a ques-
tion and answer session. 
Among the topics of con-
cern was immigration, 
specifically the recently 
publicized case of Martin 
Esquivel-Hernandez who 
was deported to Mexico. 
Doyle said that he and oth-
ers of a similar mindset 
passionately fought against 
the decision, as he felt that 
Esquivel-Hernandez might 
have been racially profiled 
by the officers responsible 
for his arrest.
Doyle spoke about the 
issues that face the Demo-
crats in the House of Repre-
sentatives, the primary one 
being that they don’t con-
trol the floor, and therefore 
can’t propose more bills. In 
this case, Doyle explained, 
the best that can be done is 
ensuring that the hard work 
of the past couple years 
wouldn’t be erased. “I am 
not turning the clock back 
to the 50s, and I am not 
turning my back on my prin-
ciples,” Doyle said.
He left the lecture hall 
with a critique of Presi-
dent Trump. As one might 
imagine, the Democratic 
representative was not 
pleased with him. In par-
ticular, President Trump’s 
attitude towards the First 
Amendment bothered him, 
causing him to claim that 
“Donald Trump has attacked 
free press in this country… 
that’s the beginning of the 
end.” He feels that Trump 
is trying to destroy our trust 
in the media, which is unac-
ceptable to Doyle. However, 
he left the hall on a hopeful 
note, “I believe there are Re-
publicans that are going to 
stand up.” He believes the 
American people will resist 
the antics of our current 
president and prevent him 
from doing anything too 
harmful.
Congressman Doyle’s 
talk is the first installment 
in Carnegie Mellon College 
Democrat’s Trump Resis-
tance Series. All semester 
long, activists, civil lead-
ers, and others will discuss 
how Democrats can stand 
against President Trump’s 
agenda.
PA CongressmanDoyle resists Trump
orders, larger companies 
have also come out with a 
similar product. Starbucks, 
for example, has a similar 
app which allows customers 
to order their drinks and food 
ahead of time. Re?ll’s goal, 
however, is to provide smaller 
coffee shops and bars with the 
same resources used by big 
corporations like Starbucks or 
McDonalds. “We want to give 
small companies that don’t 
have the technological or ?-
nancial resources the same 
opportunities to target their 
customers,” Glasner said.
Re?ll ?rst found its roots 
at William Penn Tavern, a 
small but popular bar that 
many Carnegie Mellon stu-
dents frequently attend. After 
having pitched the idea of 
the app over a year ago, the 
owner of William Penn Tavern 
acknowledged its potential 
and decided to get on board.
William Penn Tavern 
housed Re?ll’s of?cial launch 
party on Thursday, Feb. 9. The 
bar was packed with students 
all having a good time while 
trying out the app for the ?rst 
time. By the end of the night, 
over 60 orders were placed, 
adding up to around $400.
Since the app started its 
development in Pittsburgh, 
the fact that it was launched 
in the area is special to the 
team. “Pittsburgh is the heart 
of it all, and we can’t wait for 
Re?ll to start in?uencing the 
way the city enjoys its bars and 
coffee shops,” Glasner said.
Glasner believes that over 
time, it is likely that ordering 
food and drinks will eventu-
ally go mobile. “It’ll be about 
who does it properly ?rst.”
The company is now seek-
ing to expand the reach of the 
app to other locations. Those 
interested can download the 
app at usere?ll.com and try it 
out for themselves.
Re?ll takes trouble out of ordering drinks
processes have become widely 
adopted by the semiconductor 
industry.
Initially, the statistical 
testing processes developed by 
Strojwas were such a radical 
departure from the original 
chip design processes that it 
took several years for the in-
dustry to adopt them, mainly 
after it started becoming con-
strained by the ever-shrinking 
size of chips designed. “As 
the miniaturization and the 
rapid increase in the chip 
complexity progressed, they 
forced the industry to change 
and that’s how the Design for 
Manufacturing had become 
the necessity,” Strojwas said.
He says that the biggest 
modern challenge to this ?eld 
is developing even newer 
technology for chip design 
amidst the demands for more 
miniaturization and more 
computing power. The smaller 
the size of the chips, the more 
dif?cult and complex the man-
ufacturing process gets. At 
these kinds of scales, it is dif?-
cult to detect and ?x any prob-
lems that might occur during 
the manufacturing process.
“You really have to make 
sure you’re performing close 
to what you promised your 
designers,” which is the big-
gest modern dif?culty in this 
?eld due to the current limits 
of the small-sized technology, 
Strojwas said. At length scales 
smaller than 20 nanometers, 
the transistors only get more 
challenging to manufacture in 
a cost-effective way.
Something memorable 
that happened during his re-
search career was when three 
of his Ph.D. graduate students 
decided to start the com-
pany called PDF Solutions, 
which Strojwas himself is still 
involved in. The company 
has grown rapidly since its 
founding and today employs 
about 450 people. It works in 
a variety of areas, including 
engineering consulting and 
working with fabless compa-
nies to streamline the process 
for new technologies to be 
introduced to the market.
“The environment at PDF 
has been amazing and I am 
extremely fortunate that 
these guys still want me to be 
involved,” Strojwas said.
Strojwas recognized for his work in EDA[Doyle] emphasized how 
valuable it was to have a group 
of supporters that were willing 
to work at the lower levels to 
rebuild their political party.

Multiple research 
universities in Pennsylvania 
have decided to help feder-
ally funded research turn 
into more job options and 
business opportunities 
for the state by using the 
Pennsylvania I-Corps Net-
work. This I-Corps group in-
cludes Carnegie Mellon Uni-
versity, Drexel University, 
the University of Pennsyl-
vania, Pennsylvania State 
University, Lehigh Univer-
sity, and the University of 
Pittsburgh.
The National Science 
Foundation (NSF) founded 
I-Corps in 2011. I-Corps’ goal 
is to ?nance engineers and 
scientists while they work 
outside of the laboratory to 
allow certain NSF projects to 
cause a greater effect on peo-
ple. The National Institute of 
Health and the Department 
of Energy have begun using 
this program, and the 
Science Federation of Ireland 
has also taken to the I-Corps 
initiative.
“The NSF I-Corps program 
is having a transformative 
impact on innovation by cre-
ating new pathways from 
discovery to commercializa-
tion,” John Holdren, who 
served as President Obama’s 
science advisor and director 
of the White House Of?ce of 
Science and Technology Pol-
icy, said in a university press 
release. “The [Pennsylvania] 
I-Corps Network will help 
energize more faculty to ex-
plore the potential of trans-
forming their research into 
powerful ideas.”
The American Innovation 
and Competitiveness Act 
(AICA) re?ected overwhelm-
ing bipartisan support for 
the growth of the I-Corps 
program. It stated that 
I-Corps has a good track re-
cord for executing its goals, 
and federal agencies should 
take note and enact I-Corps 
practices. AICA also granted 
the NSF director permission 
to initiate both local and 
state relationships that re-
semble the work being done 
in Pennsylvania.
“NSF investments in 
fundamental research un-
derlie technologies such as 
the Internet, 3D printers, 
GPS, and solar cells,” NSF 
Director France A. Córdova 
said. “The I-Corps program, 
which ?rst started at NSF, is 
accelerating the transforma-
tion of ideas into commercial 
products and companies by 
training researchers how to 
bring their discoveries into 
the marketplace.”
A group put together by 
the universities involved in 
this plan has started look-
ing into how a Pennsylvania 
I-Corps Network would help 
improve the corroboration 
of the best and most effec-
tive procedures on coaching, 
counseling, and encourage-
ment activities for people 
who want to be entrepre-
neurs. This collection of peo-
ple is also looking into ways to 
include other higher educa-
tion places in Pennsylvania in 
the I-Corps program and how 
the I-Corps principles and 
teachings can help startups 
backed by the Ben Franklin 
Technology Partners. The Ben 
Franklin Technology Part-
ners is ?nancially supported 
by the state of Pennsylvania 
and is a renowned economic 
development organization 
that supports new ?rms and 
established manufacturers 
through monetary invest-
ments, experience in the ?eld, 
and collegiate assets.
“Within a span of only 
?ve years, the NSF Innova-
tion Corps program has es-
tablished a new model for 
catalyzing and fostering an 
innovation ecosystem that 
is ?rmly grounded in funda-
mental scienti?c research. I 
am delighted that the U.S. 
Congress and other federal 
agencies have strongly en-
dorsed and embraced this 
program,” President Subra 
Suresh said. President Suresh 
led the creation of I-Corps 
as Director of the National 
Science Foundation.
Carnegie Mellon’s I-Corps 
Site program has included 
203 people from Fall 2014 to 
Spring 2016.
“I am also pleased that 
Carnegie Mellon University, 
along with our sister institu-
tions in the Commonwealth 
of Pennsylvania, have decided 
to explore stronger collabo-
ration on statewide I-Corps 
activities,” Suresh said.

FROM THE EDITORIAL BOARD
EMMETT ELDRED
Where were you when you real-
ized that Donald Trump was go-
ing to be the next President of the 
United States? Were you at home? 
At a watch party? Did you go to 
sleep early, con?dent in Hillary 
Clinton’s victory only to realize 
the next morning that nightmares 
don’t just happen in your dreams? I 
don’t think I’ll ever forget updating 
?vethirtyeight.com every 15 seconds 
and just watching Clinton’s win 
probability sink lower and lower.
Whether you were horri?ed by or 
ecstatic about the election results — 
or just about anywhere in between 
— you probably weren’t expecting 
it. Before the results started pouring 
in, even top staffers in Trump’s cam-
paign were saying that they would 
need a miracle to win the election. 
And a miracle was exactly what they 
got: despite losing the popular vote 
by an unprecedented three million 
votes, they edged out the Clinton 
campaign by a few tens of thousands 
of votes in states that few experts, 
pundits, and campaign of?cials even 
realized were in play.
For years, journalists, political 
scientists, historians, and campaign 
strategists will be studying the per-
fect storm that dumped President 
Donald Trump on our doorstep. 
Hopefully, none more so than the 
leaders of the Democratic party. In 
2016, Democrats had an ideal map to 
retake the United States Senate and 
were up against the least quali?ed 
and most objectionable presidential 
candidate in modern American his-
tory. Still, they managed to lose in 
both key races. Now, Democrats are 
the minority party throughout the 
federal government, and they are 
at a historic low in terms of control 
over state legislatures and gover-
nor’s mansions.
Sadly, many Democratic leaders 
are pointing to external obstacles, 
rather than accepting responsibil-
ity for defeat so they can tackle the 
problems that brought them down in 
2016. For instance, House Minority 
Leader Nancy Pelosi said that Demo-
crats “don’t want a new direction,” 
even after humiliating themselves 
in 2016. Many point to FBI Director 
James Comey, who delivered a last-
minute blow to Clinton by reopen-
ing her investigation fewer than two 
weeks before the election. Many 
others point ?ngers at Wikileaks 
and Russian hackers, who were ac-
cused of targeting Clinton campaign 
of?cials expressly to elevate Trump’s 
campaign.
There is no doubt that both of 
these factors harmed her campaign. 
Perhaps, they even delivered the 
knockout blow. But given Clinton’s 
superior quali?cations, tempera-
ment, and policy positions, the race 
shouldn’t have even been close 
enough that these factors could in-
?uence the outcome. That this race 
was still competitive in November is 
a serious testament to Clinton’s seri-
ous weaknesses as a candidate and 
the Democratic Party’s utter implo-
sion. Furthermore, Clinton was only 
vulnerable to these factors because 
they reinforced ?aws in her candi-
dacy and with the Democratic Party 
overall. Finally, these factors do 
nothing to explain why Democrats 
performed below expectations in 
House and Senate races.
Democrats need to take respon-
sibility for their failure, seriously in-
vestigate what went wrong in 2016, 
and propose a series of substantive 
reforms. Such reforms should have 
three goals: bring swing voters back 
into the fold, generate enthusiasm 
in their base, and expand to places 
where Democrats aren’t even com-
petitive, such as rural areas around 
the United States, especially in the 
Deep South.
I am a young Democratic Party 
leader who plans on doing just that. 
Here at Carnegie Mellon University, 
I’m the President of the College 
Democrats. Elsewhere, I have years 
of experience as a political orga-
nizer and progressive activist, I’ll be 
working in progressive politics for 
the rest of my life. Over the course 
of the semester, I’ll be conducting an 
election “post-mortem,” to discover 
what happened, why it happened, 
and what Democrats need to do in 
the future to make sure this never 
happens again. I’ll be documenting 
my results in this column, Post-Mor-
tem.
If there are three crucial states 
for Democrats to study, they are 
the three so-called “Blue Wall” 
states, which most Democrats 
thought were securely theirs, un-
til suddenly they were not. These 
states are Wisconsin, Michigan, 
and Pennsylvania. In each of these 
states, the same three major fac-
tors contributed to the end-result. 
First, traditionally Democratic blue-
collar voters ?ipped from Clinton 
to Trump. Second, turnout among 
rural voters, who favor Republicans, 
exceeded expectations. Finally, 
turnout among urban voters, who 
favor Democrats, was smaller than 
expected in each state’s biggest city.
I will focus my investigation in 
Pennsylvania, where blue-collar 
voters in Western PA ?ocked to 
Trump in droves, where rural voters 
in my own native Central PA have 
never responded to a candidate as

Universities must stand with international studentsDemocrats share blame in 2016 election results
Editor’s note: This is the ?rst in-
stallment of Post-Mortem, a weekly 
column that seeks to explain the re-
sults of the 2016 presidential election. 
Democrats need to take responsibility 
for their failure, seriously investigate 
what went wrong in 2016, and propose a 
series of substantive reforms.
See POST-MORTEM, A6Paola Mathus/Staff Artist
Students with non-
western sounding Asian 
names were targeted last week 
at Columbia University as van-
dals ripped the name tags off their 
doors. This happened in the wake 
of the Lunar New Year, a celebration 
welcoming the new year for the East 
Asian community. While the act it-
self might seem small, it’s enough 
to send a message of exclusion to 
the students targeted —one that has 
been echoed by President Donald 
Trump not only in current legisla-
tion, but in his campaign rhetoric.
It’s no secret that since Trump 
became a prominent ?gure in the 
political arena, people have become 
more emboldened in their beliefs. 
He’s given people that are self pro-
claimed “not-racists” the comfort of 
knowing that they’re not alone in 
wanting the country to go back to a 
time of little diversity. While the idea 
of “I’m not racist, but” has always 
been a prominent one in this coun-
try, he put that idea back into the 
White House and introduced legisla-
tion that’s not “meant to be racist,” 
but conveniently only targets certain 
groups of people.
Even small acts of prejudice make 
a loud statement in a time where 
Trump has set a precedent for a 
president to exclude immigrants 
based on religion. In this case, while 
it may seem silly to target something 
as trivial as a door tag, it’s just loud 
enough to send a message of exclu-
sion. Racism isn’t as prominent as 
calling someone a derogatory term 
to their face anymore. It’s silent, but 
the silent acts of racism are the ones 
that seem the loudest. These are the 
things that don’t necessarily give 
the racist act a name and a face, but 
create a presence of racism which 
is arguably more intimidating than 
having someone outright say insult-
ing things. It creates an environment 
in which racism is something that 
a lot of people are thinking, but no 
one wants to admit to, which doesn’t 
make it any more acceptable. In 
fact, it’s almost more frightening to 
know that Americans still have these 
secret, racist thoughts that surface 
through acts like this.
Xenophobia is almost as deeply 
rooted in this country as immi-
gration is. However, despite what 
Trump would want us to believe, 
it’s not okay to belittle and erase 
people because you don’t want them 
in “your country.” Whether the stu-
dents targeted at Columbia were 
from America or not, that doesn’t 
change the fact that they are people 
and deserve to be respected as such. 
Acts like these also create a divide 
between Asian and Asian-American 
students by showing that as long as 
you appear western you’re 
safe from scrutiny.
The fact that these 
vandals targeted only 
non-western sound-
ing names also brings 
up ideas of how it is 
acceptable to have 
a heritage outside 
of the “American 
culture” as long as 
you assimilate to 
“American culture.” 
The idea that it’s 
okay to not be from 
America as long as, 
once you get here, 
you walk, talk, and 
act “American” is 
deeply ?awed. 
There is no right 
or wrong way to 
be an American. 
We’ve always 
been called a 
melting pot 
of different 
cultures and 
ethnicities. You 
shouldn’t have to erase your own 
culture to be considered an Ameri-
can. Just because someone holds 
onto the culture and heritage of an-
other country does not make them 
disquali?ed from being granted the 
same liberties that are supposed to 
be granted to American citizens.
The main critique for allowing im-
migrants into the United States is the 
claim that they take away jobs from 
Americans, but often overlooked is 
what immigrants bring to America. 
Many of them come here for educa-
tion and America is able to reap the 
bene?ts of their knowledge and suc-
cess. These students at Columbia 
have something to offer that could 
enhance the world, so what does it 
say that one of their fellow students 
has made them feel unwanted?
Carnegie Mellon and Columbia 
have a lot in common. In addition to 
being top-tier universities, both have 
a substantial international popula-
tion that de?nes the experience for 
students at these schools. Our inter-
national students have always been 
assets, whether it’s their presence 
as a teaching assistant in an intro-
ductory course or their presence in 
one of Carnegie Mellon’s many re-
search labs. It’s up to not only us as 
students to stand up and assert their 
right to be here, but it’s also up to the 
school’s administration to do so as 
well. Administrations must be there 
to support, protect, and stand up for 
their students.
Columbia and Carnegie Mellon 
are both also members 
of the Association of 
American Universities 
(AAU). Following the 
travel ban, the AAU 
released a petition 
calling for the 
termination 
of the ban in 
defense of the 
the interna-
tional students 
represented by 
the 62 research 
universities that 
are a part of the 
organization. 
The AAU has three 
main reasons for 
supporting an end 
to the travel ban. 
The ?rst is that it 
is discriminatory 
for only targeting 
certain countries 
and only people of 
certain religions 
from those coun-
tries. The second 
is that it is “detrimental to the na-
tional interests of the United States” 
because it limits the applicant pool 
for all of the institutions of higher 
learning in the United States. The 
last is because it places an unfair 
burden on the international students 
at AAU schools. This collective group 
of institutions recognizes that people 
come from all over the world to share 
their talents with us here in the Unit-
ed States and we need to make sure 
that nothing infringes on their abili-
ties to pursue their education.
When acts of prejudice as out-
right as this happen at the type of 
school that’s supposed to be open 
to international students, it could 
send the talent that prospective in-
ternational students have to offer 
elsewhere. In addition to recogniz-
ing that these students bring an im-
measurable amount of talent to the 
United States, the AAU also recog-
nizes that these students are people 
and that even if they aren’t partici-
pating in groundbreaking research 
or projects, they still deserve to feel 
like they belong in their academic 
communities.
An immigrant doesn’t have to 
be the next Albert Einstein to feel 
like they belong or add value to this 
country. While we don’t doubt that 
the students at Columbia will go 
on to do extraordinary things, they 
shouldn’t have to prove that they 
belong here by adopting western 
sounding names and abandoning 
their culture. We can’t let the rheto-
ric Trump has been preaching allow 
us to be complacent to random acts 
of prejudice that occur. We must be 
more vigilant now than ever. Just be-
cause someone who looks the other 
way on this type of behavior is now 
our president doesn’t mean that we 
can also just ignore these things. 
Trump and many other Americans 
wanting to go back to a time when 
diversity was scarce and America 
was “great” doesn’t mean that we 
can’t still hold them to the current 
standards for xenophobia.
If the rest of the country won’t 
stand with international students, 
then we as a campus community, 
along with universities everywhere, 
must stand together and protect our 
international classmates. They did 
not come here to ruin this country as 
Trump would like us to believe. They 
come here to advance not only our 
academics as a university, but to pur-
sue the American dream promised to 
everyone that travels here, no matter 
what country they come from.

Trump threatens Johnson Amendment, gives religion voice
Gender bias still hinders women’s progress in STEM ?elds
CASSIE SCANLON
A hundred years ago, women 
did not have the right vote. Today, 
women not only have the right to 
vote, but can also hold public of?ce. 
College education is no longer some-
thing reserved for men. In 2014, the 
world saw the ?rst woman win a 
Nobel Prize in mathematics. In 2016, 
the United States saw the ?rst female 
candidate nominated for president 
by a majority political party, and the 
?rst female campaign manager led a 
political candidate to a presidential 
victory. Yet, despite this progress, 
women are still lagging behind in 
law, politics, and science, technol-
ogy, engineering, and mathematics 
(STEM). Only we as a society can ?x 
this problem.
Women gaining progress in STEM 
has been a long fought battle and 
one that has not advanced by much. 
According to statistics provided by 
the National Girls Collaborative 
Project, women make up half of the 
college-educated workforce in the 
United States, yet only 29 percent of 
the STEM workforce.
The reason behind the lack of 
women in STEM ?elds isn’t that wom-
en aren’t interested — according to a 
Girl Scouts’ research study, 74 per-
cent of girls express interest in STEM. 
Yet despite this difference, women 
still make up less than 30 percent of 
those who receive computer science 
degrees, as shown in a study done by 
the National Student Clearinghouse 
Research Center. Something hap-
pens to these young girls before they 
reach college. And unfortunately, it 
isn’t only in STEM ?elds where this 
gender bias occurs.
Gender bias is also present in 
politics and law. The American Bar 
Association released a study that 
found that only 36 percent of those 
in the legal profession were women. 
Women in Congress make up less 
than 20 percent of the seats in the 
House and Senate. Women are still 
subject to sexism in the legal work-
place, with many often mistaken as 
secretaries or ?nding themselves 
subject to remarks about trivial 
things such as a clothing.
While women are making prog-
ress — with women making up the 
majority of law school students for 
the ?rst time — they are still far be-
hind in STEM ?elds. As far as politics 
are concerned, at the current rate of 
progress, women won’t achieve fair 
representation for almost 500 years. 
It is correct to assume that women 
are making progress, but this prog-
ress is not happening as fast as it 
must.
The gender bias present in STEM, 
law, and politics is a result of soci-
ety, not any lower status in the face 
of the law. A study from the Wom-
en & Politics Institute at American 
University revealed that women are 
less likely than men to receive the 
suggestion from anyone to run for 
of?ce. The study also found 
that women are more likely 
than men to perceive the 
electoral environment 
as highly competitive 
and biased against 
female candidates, 
which most likely 
is the result of 
the constant talk 
of how politics 
is biased against 
women, without 
offering any so-
lutions on how to 
change it.
The lack of wom-
en in STEM, 
law, and politics is largely due to 
gender stereotypes against women. 
Women are often teased in schools 
and receive little encouragement in 
STEM interests. Somewhere along 
the line, women are either subcon-
sciously or consciously told that 
they are not as smart as men, and 
a recent study showed that despite 
young women performing better 
than young males on tests, they are 
less likely to associate “female” with 
being “really, really smart.”
It isn’t enough to simply acknowl-
edge that a gender gap exists in 
STEM, law, and politics — we need to 
change the way we as a society treat 
young women and girls. Constantly 
reminding these young women and 
girls of the bias against them is not 
going to achieve anything. The mon-
umental changes begin with each 
and every American.
There is no need to tell young 
girls about how STEM, law, and po-
litical ?elds are biased against them. 
Instead, they need encouragement 
to study these ?elds. Current female 
engineers, scientists, attorneys, and 
politicians should become mentors 
for young girls and help give them 
the encouragement they need so 
these statistics become obsolete. The 
United States does not need a quota 
system for females to achieve equal-
ity in these male-dominated profes-
sions. Women have equal rights un-
der the law, and there is no reason 
that women are not strong enough to 
build ourselves up without the help 
of the government.
Even those who aren’t women 
in STEM, law, and politics can help 
combat stereotypes 
and allow the 
gender gap to shrink in these ?elds. 
Empower women not through their 
bodies, but through their brains. If a 
young girl is interested in math, tell 
her about engineering. If she asks you 
why we haven’t had a female presi-
dent, don’t tell her because there’s a 
gender gap in politics between men 
and women — tell her it is simply 
because she wasn’t born yet. Don’t 
remind her how she will have a long 
road ahead in STEM, law, and poli-
tics; she will learn this on her own.
Instead, we as a society need to fo-
cus on empowering these young girls 
in elementary and middle schools to 
study STEM, law, and politics, and 
assure them that they are brilliant 
individuals. Doing so is the only way 
we can stop writing articles about 
male dominated ?elds and shrink 
the gender gap, simply because these 
problems won’t exist anymore.

Right when the vast majority 
of American citizens checked their 
newsfeed and asked themselves 
“what did Donald Trump do this 
time?”, Trump, over the National 
Prayer Breakfast, announced his 
wish to “totally destroy” the Johnson 
Amendment.
Add that to a list of jarring conver-
sations held over a meal.
After a seemingly endless string 
of controversies and angry tweets, 
this may not have been a surprise for 
many, but the preexisting political 
chaos does not negate the potentially 
disastrous aftermath that the repeal 
of the Johnson Amendment can have 
on the United States, its citizens, 
and the core principles in which this 
country was founded on.
The Johnson Amendment, enact-
ed in 1954, is a tax code that “prohib-
its all 501(c)(3) non-pro?t organi-
zations from endorsing or opposing 
political candidates.” Although this 
amendment is multifaceted and re-
ligious organizations are only one 
type of organization that are affect-
ed, there is a clear con?ict of interest 
that emerges from this decision to 
overturn it — prominently, with the 
First Amendment.
The First Amendment is famous 
for protecting freedom of speech, but 
it also entails separation of church 
and state. When our founding 
fathers estab-
lished this 
nation 
in 1776, they were escaping a nation 
where government was con?ated 
with religion and hoped that this new 
nation would not repeat the same 
mistake. Over the years, America 
became a melting pot where people 
were gaining the right to practice 
their faith. Although the degree of re-
ligious tolerance in the United States 
is debatable, most can agree that, in 
theory, America’s core values cherish 
the “life, liberty, and pursuit of hap-
piness” for all Americans.
There are a multitude of incen-
tives for Trump to meddle with the 
Johnson Amendment. Even before 
he was sworn into of?ce in January, 
while on the campaign trail, he tried 
to pander to the evangelical votes. An 
overwhelming majority of white 
evangelicals voted for Trump 
in November 2016. Trump 
appealed to the evangeli-
cal voters for various 
reasons such as his 
promise to overturn Roe v. Wade, a 
court case which gave women the 
right to abortions, and his choice in 
running mate, former Indiana gover-
nor Mike Pence.
Overturning the Johnson 
Amendment would mean evangelists 
— especially televangelists — can 
contribute and invest more into poli-
tics than ever before, and Trump is 
cognizant of the power of the repeal. 
Jerry Falwell Jr., an early Trump en-
dorser, states that “[Trump] thinks 
it is going to be a revolution in the 
Christian world.” Although Trump 
did not gain nearly as much sup-
port from non-white evangelists, 
the larger, wealthier, and more in-
?uential demographic that he has 
attracted far outweighs the lack of 
support he has received from other 
demographics.
Although these 
backers can af-
ford the repeal 
of the John-
son Amend-
ments, these 
are not the 
only people 
affected by 
the repeal. 
The John-
son Amend-
ment also 
allows places 
of worship of 
all faiths — not 
just Christianity 
— to be ex-
empt from pay-
ing taxes. Many 
churches across the country rely 
on the donations of attendees in or-
der to scrape by and make a living. 
That is merely scratching the sur-
face — for minority religions, the 
numbers are usually more depress-
ing. In order for Trump to get his 
hands on money from friends such 
as Mark Burns, pastor and evan-
gelist who claims to “see the mes-
sage of grace” in Trump, and Joel 
Osteen, pastor and televangelist 
who praised Trump as “a friend 
of our ministry”, Trump must ?rst 
push more economic burdens 
down the throats of the countless 
listeners and their respective places 
of worship.
It is worth mentioning that this 
is not the ?rst threat on the First 
Amendment that Trump has im-
posed. On the campaign trail, he 
stated he would “open up our li-
bel laws” so that news organizations 
could be sued and he could “win lots 
of money.” His Twitter has been ram-
pant with him calling out various 
media sources such as Cable News 
Network and the New York Times as 
“fake news.” He even tried to de?ne 
freedom of the press in a Tweet, read-
ing “It is not ‘freedom of the press’ 
when newspapers and others are al-
lowed to say and write whatever they 
want even if it is completely false!”
The Alliance Defending Freedom, 
a conservative group that is in favor 
of religion being more prominent in 
the public space, “[argues] that [the 
Johnson Amendment] restricts free 
speech by censoring the content of 
a pastor’s sermon,” thus possibly 
creating an argument that Trump 
is not, in fact, jeopardizing the First 
Amendment. However, what Trump 
and a signi?cant portion of his sup-
porters fail to realize is that the First 
Amendment is not just applicable 
when it is convenient to ful?ll their 
own agenda and disposable in any 
other context.
Tomi Lahren, a public Trump sup-
porter, claimed that Trump would 
“shake-up Washington.” Although 
many of her stances have been con-
troversial, people from both sides 
of the political divide can probably 
agree that the White House has not 
been quite the same since the day 
Donald Trump transformed from 
businessman and television personal-
ity into 45th President of the United 
States.
In many respects, Trump has 
shaken up Washington. He “drained 
the swamp” and is in the process 
of re-swamping to unprecedented 
levels by ?lling his Cabinet with 
controversial choices such as 
Ben Carson for the United States 
Secretary of Housing and Urban 
Development and, more recently, 
Betsy DeVos for the United States 
Secretary of Education. His stance 
on the First Amendment has simply 
been the cherry on top of his colossal 
sundae that he has managed to make 
in mere weeks of being in of?ce.
“Separation of church and state” 
has been something clamored about 
and cherished since America ?rst be-
came a sovereign nation. At the tra-
jectory we are heading, we might ?nd 
our nation back to where it was in 
1776. Unfortunately, this time we do 
not have a “new world” to retreat to if 
we ?nd our churches buying political 
power with cold, hard cash.

ferociously as they did to Trump, 
and where voter turnout in Philadel-
phia was stunningly poor.
For now, I’ll conclude on an im-
portant caveat: while Democrats 
need to take a serious look in the 
mirror, that doesn’t even compare 
with the soul-searching that must be 
done within the Republican Party. 
Unfortunately, no one wants to ex-
amine themselves too closely when 
they’re on top of the world because 
they might discover that the things 
they need to change are the very 
things that put them on top.
While Democrats ran an ex-
tremely ?awed campaign, Repub-
licans exploited racism, sexism, 
and xenophobia to win. They pro-
moted a candidate who they knew 
was not only unquali?ed to serve 
as President but was also a clear 
threat to democracy, national secu-
rity, and the world order. And they 
did so by exploiting fear, attacking 
the media, undermining America’s 
faith in democratic institutions, 
sowing doubt and confusion where 
matters of clear fact ought to pre-
vail, and demagoguing women, 
people of color, Muslims, and immi-
grants. Democrats fought poorly for 
the right things while Republicans 
fought well for the wrong things.
By critiquing the Democratic 
Party, I do not wish to imply false 
equivalence between the magnitude 
of Democrats’ strategic failure and 
the magnitude of the GOP’s moral 
failure. I am critiquing the Demo-
cratic Party because that is an insti-
tution in which I have the creden-
tials, authority, and investment to 
do so. Only Republicans can change 
their party, and I am calling on them 
to do the right thing. With that said, 
I want to be perfectly clear in stat-
ing that while Democrats must re-
spond to their failure in 2016, the 
Democratic Party must never pull 
the pages out of Trump’s playbook 
that attack the most vulnerable peo-
ple in our society. It is not worth it 
to gain the world but lose our souls. 
That is something that I and any oth-
er Democratic of?cial must always 
bear in mind as we seek to move for-
ward. See you next week!

Democratic Party must

Protesters at Berkeley exemplify free speech
LYDIA GREEN
Junior Staffwriter
On Wednesday, Feb. 1, Breitbart 
News editor Milo Yiannopoulos 
was scheduled to give a talk for the 
University of California Berkeley 
College Republicans club to the dis-
may of many Berkeley community 
members, who decided to protest. 
Ahead of the talk, however, around 
150 masked outsiders from Oak-
land, CA interrupted the peaceful 
protest of Yiannopoulos and rac-
ism and began rioting, destroying 
university property and attacking 
Republicans on campus. As a result, 
the university canceled the event as 
a safety measure.
In the aftermath of the riot, 
Donald Trump, Yiannopoulos, and 
their supporters have claimed that, 
by cancelling the talk, the university 
attacked Yiannopoulos’s freedom 
of speech and should be punished. 
That perception contains a gross 
misunderstanding of the nature and 
purpose of freedom.
The First Amendment to the Con-
stitution, the primary legal source 
of freedom in the United States, pro-
tects citizens from being limited in 
freedom by the government — but it 
says nothing about citizens’ abilities 
to silence one another. The student 
protestors, university, and outsider 
rioters were all private citizens, so, 
even ignoring the fact that he’s not 
an American citizen, Yiannopoulos 
cannot legally claim any in-
fringement of rights.
In fact, if anyone’s 
freedom of speech was 
under attack here, it is 
that of the peaceful stu-
dent protestors. Trump 
himself is now a mem-
ber of the United States 
government, so any at-
tempts on his part to 
silence citizens 
are of?cially cen-
sorship.
In his tweet 
about the Yianno-
poulos-Berkeley 
affair, Trump sug-
gested that Berke-
ley’s federal fund-
ing should be cut 
for cancelling Yi-
annopoulos’s talk. 
However, the vio-
lent rioters were in 
no way af?liated 
with the univer-
sity, so the only 
roles that 
the university actually played were 
those of allowing students to speak 
out against Yiannopoulos’ hate 
speech, cancelling Yiannopoulos’ 
talk to protect its students and staff 
from the violent rioters, and even 
sending out a message afterwards 
reaf?rming its commitment to free-
dom of speech. If Trump were to 
actually cut funding to Berkeley, he, 
as a member of the United States 
government, would be punishing 
students for speaking out against 
their government, and that would 
be an infringement of ?rst amend-
ment rights.
The purpose of freedom in the 
United States is to help people live 
the happiest, healthiest lives pos-
sible. Freedom of speech ensures 
that vulnerable members of society 
have outlets to express their discon-
tent without fear of punishment: 
Freedom of religion allows people 
openly believe whatever they want. 
Freedom of the press allows us to 
have knowledge about our nation 
and government and enables us 
to make fully informed decisions 
about our lives. All of these free-
doms work to uphold the values 
of self-empowerment and nurtur-
ance, values that are undermined 
by Yiannopoulos’ hate speech. Sup-
posedly, when Yiannopoulos spoke 
at Berkeley, he was going to publicly 
name undocumented Berkeley stu-
dents. Undocumented immigrants 
are the sort of vulnerable Americans 
that constitutional freedoms are de-
signed to protect.
If Yiannopoulos had spoken, he 
would have wrecked those students’ 
lives. At worst, these students 
would have been deported, rip-
ping them away from their friends 
and lives in the United States. At 
the very least, they and their 
families would have had to 
live with a heightened 
fear of deportation. 
People living in fear are 
not living their happi-
est, healthiest lives. 
People living in fear 
are not free.
Yiannopoulos is 
advocating for the 
freedom to take 
away the freedom 
of others. That 
is unacceptable 
and goes against 
everything that 
America is sup-
posed to stand 
for.
New abortion law endangers women
Simin Lee/Art Editor
Bernice Yu/Junior Staff Artist
SYDNEY ROSLIN
The latest installment of the saga 
of lawmakers attempting to dic-
tate a woman’s choices in regards 
to her own body comes a law out 
of Arkansas, which bans all dilation 
and extraction (D&E) abortion pro-
cedures, the safest way for women to 
end pregnancies during the second 
trimester.
The bill, named the Unborn 
Child Protection From Dismember-
ment Abortion Act, is similar to 
D&E prohibitions that are in effect 
in Mississippi and West Virginia, 
and bans that have been intro-
duced but blocked by the courts in 
Kansas, Oklahoma, Alabama, and 
Louisiana. It is being challenged by 
the American Civil Liberties Union 
(ACLU), because by prohibiting the 
most common and safest abortion 
procedure in the second trimester, it 
is essentially banning second trimes-
ter abortions, directly contradicting 
Roe v. Wade. The second trimester 
begins at week thirteen of the preg-
nancy, but Roe v. Wade protects a 
mother’s right to an abortion up un-
til the fetus would be viable outside 
the womb, which is around 20-22 
weeks of pregnancy.
Even more sinister, however, 
is a clause in the law that allows a 
woman’s husband, if he is the baby’s 
father, to sue her doctor for civil 
damages or injunctive relief, block-
ing the woman from being able to 
go forward with a D&E abortion. If 
the woman is a minor, her parents or 
legal guardians can also sue to stop 
the procedure.
The clause is included for the 
purpose of allowing women’s 
husbands and their guardians 
to retroactively sue doctors 
who have performed or at-
tempted to perform D&E 
procedures and prevent 
those doctors from con-
tinuing to perform those 
operations. It wouldn’t 
allow for lawsuits to 
block other abortion pro-
cedures that are still legal, 
and would only al-
low for D&E proce-
dures in progress 
to be blocked. It 
also wouldn’t al-
low for the wom-
an in question 
to be sued, only 
her physician. It is included as a le-
gal backup, in case the prohibition is 
not enough to stop doctors from per-
forming the banned procedure. But 
although the clause is included to 
penalize doctors, it sets a terrifying 
precedent in the ?ght for a woman’s 
autonomy over her own body.
From a medical standpoint alone, 
an abortion is a procedure like any 
other, one that comes with inher-
ent risks and, in the end, will have 
the most impact on the patient in 
question. What people often fail to 
consider, however, is that carrying 
a child to term and giving birth are 
medical undertakings that come 
with signi?cant risks to the mother 
alone. A pregnant woman’s husband 
will not have to face anemia or morn-
ing sickness due to his wife’s preg-
nancy. The woman’s parents will not 
run the risk of internal bleeding or 
hypertension during delivery. It is 
the mother that bears the medical 
burdens in both cases, so it is the 
mother, and only the mother, who 
should decide which path to choose. 
By giving others the right to sue the 
doctor, thereby blocking the abor-
tion, we are giving that choice to 
people who have no medical stakes 
in the decision.
This also sets a precedent regard-
ing a woman’s power in her relation-
ships. By dictating that a husband 
can take steps to halt an abortion in 
its tracks, the Arkansas government 
is giving an enormous amount of 
power to the husbands in question, a 
type of power that can be incredibly 
dangerous for expecting mothers.
It is estimated by the March of 
Dimes that almost one out of ev-
ery six pregnant women have been 
abused by a partner. Abuse is often 
triggered by pregnancy, especially 
by unplanned pregnancy (which are 
often the types of pregnancies that 
require abortions), often attributed 
to jealousy or stress due to the pros-
pect of ?nancially supporting a child. 
Children further tie these women to 
the men that hurt them, because 
whether or not the woman decides 
to leave, she has a tie to her husband 
via her child.
A mother is also less likely to 
leave an abusive husband due 
to ?nancial reasons. If she is trying 
to leave an abusive husband but has 
both herself and her child to worry 
about ?nancially, it is harder for her 
to leave and become ?nancially in-
dependent. Giving a woman access 
to an abortion gives her a way to es-
cape dangerous and potentially life-
threatening abusive situations like 
this, and giving a woman the power 
to make her own decisions regarding 
an abortion enables her to make this 
escape without permission or obsta-
cle from an abusive husband.
The bill, and other similar laws, 
are dangerous to women and expect-
ant mothers across the country. They 
don’t reduce abortion rates: they 
only force women in desperate situa-
tions to ?nd other ways to terminate 
pregnancies. In a study published in 
The Lancet medical journal, research 
showed that in countries where 
abortions are illegal, the number 
of abortions performed per 1,000 
women is actually higher (37) than 
that in countries where abortions are 
legal (34).
Even though this act is called 
the Unborn Child Protection From 
Dismemberment Abortion Act, this 
is a misnomer. The choice to get an 
abortion is not an easy one. No one 
wants to get an abortion: they are 
expensive, inconvenient, and come 
with medical risks. A woman might 
decide to get an abortion because 
she knows she is not capable of rais-
ing a child, because she is carrying a 
child who has almost no chance of 
surviving outside of the womb, be-
cause she faces health risks, because 
she is stuck in an abusive relation-
ship that a child would bind her to, 
or because of a variety of reasons 
that are completely valid and 
in her best interests as well as 
those of an unborn child who 
would have to be raised in 
dire conditions.
If a woman is desperate 
enough to make the choice 
to terminate a pregnancy, she 
is going to ?nd a way to termi-
nate that pregnancy, by illegal 
means if necessary.
Abortion bans do not pro-
tect unborn children: they 
put pregnant women at risk 
and take power away from 
women who have the right to 
make decisions in their best 
interests. In the end, the only 
person who should decide 
what happens to a wom-
an’s body is the woman 
herself. A pregnant 
woman’s mother, 
father, or husband 
is not the person 
who should be 
making deci-
sions regard-
ing her health. 
The question of 
abortion is one 
to be brought up 
between a wom-
an and her doc-
tor, not a woman 
and the U.S. gov-
ernment.

On Tuesday, Feb. 7, Dr. 
Thomas S. Mullaney, associate 
professor of Chinese history 
at Stanford University, visited 
Carnegie Mellon University to 
discuss the history and devel-
opment of Chinese comput-
ing, the topic of his upcoming 
book, The Chinese Typewriter. 
Mullaney specializes in the 
?elds of East Asia, the History 
of Science, and Global History, 
and received his Ph.D. from 
Columbia University. 
Invited to Pittsburgh by 
Carnegie Mellon’s Depart-
ment of History, Mullaney 
presented his lecture, “The 
Ecologies of Chinese Comput-
ing.” He began by ?rst explain-
ing the fundamental differ-
ence between the characters 
of the Chinese language, and 
the letters of the Latin alpha-
bet that dominate the Western 
world. There is no such thing 
as “typing” in Chinese. The 
language is written electroni-
cally by input, retrieving in-
formation from a database to 
print something on paper or 
on screen.
When Chinese linguists 
began to develop the Chinese 
typewriter in the early 20th 
century, Mullaney explained, 
they considered the basic idea 
of typing: what you type is 
what you get. In the 1940s, Lin 
Yutang, a Chinese linguist and 
inventor, introduced the con-
cept of putting only the radi-
cals that make up characters 
and several common charac-
ters on a keyboard because it 
is impossible to ?t over 50,000 
characters on a keyboard, 
compared to the 26 characters 
of the Latin alphabet. Instead, 
a typewriter would have a da-
tabase of characters and parts 
of characters which a writer 
would access by pressing the 
keys.
One innovation Mullaney 
presented was predictive 
text, which placed characters 
that were commonly used to-
gether. For example, each of 
the characters in the name 
‘Mao Zedong’ were spread 
apart on the keyboard, but 
through predictive text, were 
organized next to each other, 
which lends to quicker, more 
ef?cient typing. Another in-
novation was autocompletion, 
similar to today’s autocorrect. 
Because Chinese characters 
are not necessarily spelled out, 
the concept of autocompletion 
is a retrieval mechanism; not 
all of the parts of a charac-
ter are needed to arrive at an 
unambiguous location in the 
character database to print the 
desired character.
Mullaney continued his 
argument by discussing the 
keyboard that the Chinese 
government developed in the 
closing years of the Cultural 
Revolution (1966-1976). This 
keyboard had 256 keys, some 
with full-body characters, but 
mostly with bits and pieces of 
characters, bringing back Lin 
Yutang’s original ideas thirty 
years later. This keyboard was 
considered a medium-sized 
keyboard in comparison to the 
QWERTY keyboard used in 
the West.
To bring his lecture to the 
present day, Mullaney con-
ceded that in the 1990s, the 
Chinese input system slowly 
began to look just like the 
QWERTY keyboard. However, 
he labeled this era as “a ner-
vous system of Input Wars,” 
when hundreds of different 
input systems in China were 
competing with one another 
all while standardization was 
becoming more common. 
Most of these systems were 
structure-based systems, not 
the Pinyin system — the input 
of romanized Chinese charac-
ters by pronunciation that we 
see so commonly today. One 
structure-based system still 
prominent today is the Wubi 
input system, which is much 
faster and transcends speci?c 
dialect pronunciation.
Mullaney also explained 
other input systems, such 
as shaped-based retrieval, 
which assigned characters 
to a particular shape of Latin 
characters, and the double-
pinyin method, which used 
Latin letters as variables for 
different elements of Chinese 
pronunciation. Though they 
are not in use, these systems 
are a testament of the creativ-
ity of Chinese linguists in a 
globalized world dominated 
by Latin languages, especially 
English.
Despite the prevalent use 
of the Pinyin system, Mullaney 
stressed that we should not 
assume that the ‘phonetici-
zation’ of characters is com-
plete or concrete. On the con-
trary, he said, the capacity of 
structure-based systems such 
as Wubi is great, beginning 
with their ef?ciency.
At the end of his lecture, 
Mullaney challenged the 
audience to think about 
how Chinese computing 
has evolved, and how it will 
continue to evolve in the face 
of constant technological 
advancement. Mullaney’s up-
coming book, The Chinese 
Typewriter (MIT Press 2017), 
will be released in the summer 
of 2017.

New test detects Ebola virus quickly
Scientists are currently de-
veloping a new test that has 
the potential to detect Ebola, 
the virus that causes a number 
of potentially fatal symptoms, 
including fever, vomiting, di-
arrhea and internal bleeding.
According to the World 
Health Organization, there are 
no licensed cures for Ebola, 
although two are undergoing 
human safety testing. Current-
ly, Ebola is detected by exam-
ining genetic material. It takes 
an entire day to detect and the 
samples must be examined in 
a specialized laboratory.
Researchers reported 
the new test on Feb. 6 at the 
American Society for Micro-
biology Biothreats meeting. 
They are examining the use of 
antibodies that latch onto the 
virus and ?ag it — much like a 
pregnancy test. One antibody, 
containing gold nanoparticles, 
forcibly removes the virus par-
ticles from the sample, while 
another reveals the virus’ pres-
ence in the form of a colored 
line. By dabbing a patient’s 
blood onto a paper contain-
ing the antibodies, the colored 
line will appear either con-
?rming or denying the virus’ 
presence after 10 to 15 min-
utes.
However, the test only gives 
accurate results once a patient 
has been sick with Ebola for a 
long period of time.

UN calls for more women in STEM
On Saturday, Feb. 7, the 
annual International Day of 
Women and Girls in Science, 
the United Nations (UN) 
Secretary-General António 
Guterres called for more in-
vestment to teach science, 
technology, engineering, and 
mathematics (STEM) to girls 
and women worldwide, and 
more equal access.
“For too long, discrimina-
tory stereotypes have pre-
vented women and girls from 
having equal access to educa-
tion in science, technology, 
engineering, and math,” said 
Mr. Guterres in his message. 
“On this International Day, I 
urge commitment to end bias, 
greater investments in STEM 
education for all women and 
girls as well as opportunities 
for their careers and longer-
term professional advance-
ment so that all can bene?t 
from their ground-breaking 
future contributions.”
The UN Educational, Scien-
ti?c and Cultural Organization 
released its annual science re-
port earlier this week titled 
‘Towards 2030’ which fea-
tured a section called ‘Global 
Trends in Human Capital,’ not-
ing that women are a minor-
ity in the research world, have 
more limited access to funding 
than men, and are less repre-
sented as faculty at prestigious 
universities.

Rabies may reveal brain cancer cure
Researchers are look-
ing into a seemingly uncon-
ventional way to treat brain 
cancer — through rabies. Ac-
cording to the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention, 
rabies is a viral disease trans-
mitted from wild animal bites.
It holds interest amongst 
researchers primarily due 
to its capability to infect 
the central nervous system. 
Normally, this will infect 
brain tissue, causing disease 
in the brain and resulting in 
death. Scientists are trying to 
mimic this capability in order 
to infect brain tumors with 
tumor-killing nanoparticles.
Researchers from 
Sungkyunkwan University 
in Suwon, South Korea are 
engineering gold nanoparti-
cles that have the same shape 
and size as the rabies virus, 
giving the particle more sur-
face area. This allows for more 
receptors to bind to nerve cells. 
The nanoparticles themselves 
do not carry any drug, instead 
relying on heat produced from 
the gold rods absorbing light 
to kill surrounding tissue.
This approach works 
only in mice. Major concerns 
regarding this method include 
whether the nanoparticles 
actually make it to the tumor, 
side effects and potential 
toxicity from the rabies virus.

SpaceX to carry equipment to ISS
SpaceX is currently prepar-
ing for the launch of its Falcon 
9 rocket from NASA’s Kennedy

Feb. 18. This launch signi?es

sion for the International

Another interesting project 
is Raven, which is a robotic 
system that will be installed 
on the ISS in order to observe 
facets of any approaching 
vehicles. Autonomously, the 
ISS will then gimbal or pivot 
autonomously for rendezvous.

Self-driven cars may cause organ donor shortage 
As autonomous vehicles 
become the norm in the 
future, the roads will arguably 
be a safer place, resulting 
in fewer accidents and less 
death. However, while less 
death is always good from a 
humanitarian perspective, 
it may not be from an organ 
donation perspective.
According to national data 
from the Organ Procurement 
and Transplantation Network 
(OPTN), 13.6 percent of 
people who donated organs 
after they died in 2016 were 
killed in automobile accidents. 
There are over 120,000 people 
on an organ transplant list a 
day, and not nearly enough or-
gans to go around.
Science offers another 
solution to this organ short-
age — 3D printing and other 
bioengineering technologies. 
There are a number of 
different ways researchers are 
looking into organ transplant 
— one is to regrow the organ 
using stem cells and avoid re-
placement altogether. Another 
is to build new organs using 
tissue scaffolds and stem cells 
or 3D printing and use those 
for transplantation.
This ?eld of modern 
research could make drastic 
improvements on the current 
organ shortage. With science, 
it’s a win-win situation.

Figurine discovered in ancient tombs
Archaeologists have 
discovered a 1,700 year-old 
tomb during an expedition 
to remodel a Seventh-day 
Adventist church in Colima, 
Mexico. The tomb dates be-
tween zero and 500 CE during 
the Comala Period.
The tomb is broken up into 
three burial layers. In the ?rst 
layer, the archaeologists found 
12 skulls and other human 
bones piled atop each other. 
According to Rosa María 
Flores Ramírez, a physical 
anthropologist at the National 
Institute of Anthropology and 
History in Mexico, some of the 
skulls showed damage such as 
tooth fractures and wear. The 
second burial level contained 
a male and female ?gurine 
placed face down next to two 
more skulls and several pots. 
Both ?gurines were sculpted 
from ?ne paste and adorned 
with elaborate headdresses.
The fact that the tomb was 
found untouched is very rare 
— more often than not, tombs 
are found already looted. This 
gave the archaeologists “a ?rst 
approach with the bone re-
mains, to observe the lesions, 
deformations and to have 
more information to know 
what was their way of life,” 
the researchers said in the 
statement.

Uber has hired veteran 
NASA engineer Mark Moore 
as its Director of Engineering 
for Aviation to help realize its 
long-term program for devel-
oping ?ying car technology.
Moore’s move to Uber fol-
lows 30 years of research at 
NASA, working with electric 
motors in vertical takeoff and 
landing vehicles (VTOLs), 
which are ?ying cars. He 
made the switch because he 
believes Uber’s vision for ac-
cessible, affordable ?ying cars 
is achievable: “I can’t think of 
another company in a stronger 
position to be the leader for 
this new ecosystem and make 
the urban electric VTOL mar-
ket real,” he told Bloomberg.
Moore’s research paper on 
electrically powered VTOL 
technology inspired start-
ups and aviation companies 
to investigate the technol-
ogy he described. Several tech 
companies are currently de-
veloping VTOL concepts both 
in the U.S. and abroad, some 
funded by high-pro?le tech 
entrepreneurs like Google co-
founder Larry Page.
Moore previously worked 
as a consultant for Uber when 
the company ?rst released the 
white paper on its vision for 
VTOL vehicles, Uber Elevate.
Uber’s ultimate goal is to 
eliminate practical barriers to 
VTOL use so that it can offer 
a VTOL service to allow as-
tonishingly quick commutes 
in metropolitan areas, even 
those with heavy traf?c. As the 
white paper on Uber Elevate 
explains, “Just as skyscrapers 
allowed cities to use limited 
land more ef?ciently, urban 
air transportation will use 
three-dimensional airspace to 
alleviate transportation con-
gestion on the ground.”
Uber Elevate is not neces-
sarily working towards build-
ing a prototype vehicle; in-
stead, its aim is to identify and 
resolve the practical barriers 
to implementing a system of 
VTOLs in an urban environ-
ment. Some of these concerns 
include safety protocols for 
urban airspace, regulations 
for potential harmful emis-
sions, noise pollution, and af-
fordability for the consumer 
— concerns which Moore will 
presumably help address in his 
new position.
Though the technologi-
cal and logistical concerns 
highlighted by Uber Elevate 
are signi?cant, they are not 
insurmountable. After all, ur-
ban airspace is already used 
frequently by helicopters, 
and increasingly by drones, 
with little issue. And though 
a VTOL taxi service would be 
expensive at ?rst, Uber esti-
mates that once it has imple-
mented an infrastructure of 
“vertiports” for takeoff and 
landing, a ride in a ?ying 
car might cost no more 
than a trip in an Uber 
does today.
In fact, Moore pre-
dicts that ?ying cars con-
trolled by humans will 
be in the testing phase within 
one to three years, and Uber 
projects that they will begin 
offering VTOL rides in some 
cities within the next ?ve to 
ten years.
Flying cars would come 
with several new issues that 
must be addressed. 
New driving tests will need 
to be made, fatal accidents 
may become more frequent 
(consider, for example, how a 
driver must react when his ve-
hicle runs out of fuel midair).
Flying cars will also chal-
lenge the energy industry. If 
a market is developed, prices 
of jet fuel will have to drop 
drastically for the regular 
user to be able to afford it on 
a daily basis. Until these issues 
are addressed, any ?ying car 
manufacturer will struggle to 
sell their product to venture 
capitalist, investors and 
the public.

The commercial airliner 
Concorde, commissioned 
in 1976, once traversed the 
Atlantic in a little less than 
three and a half hours. The 
result of British Airways and 
Air France collaboration, the 
supersonic plane demonstrat-
ed how small we could make 
the world. Achieving super-
sonic ?ight not only demand-
ed engineering and design 
creativity, but also introduced 
a great deal of risk as well. 
How did the Concorde ?y fast-
er than the speed of sound, 
and why couldn’t it last?
The jet engines that thrust 
the plane forward were the 
twin Rolls-Royce/Snecma 
Olympus 593s. Producing up 
to 142 kN (142 kilo-Newtons 
of force), the titanium engines 
were designed to withstand 
high temperatures and pres-
sure. It worked by taking in air 
at high speed and pressure, 
then compressing it through 
seven stages. The compressed 
air was then mixed with jet 
fuel and ignited. The ignition 
was released from the engine 
nozzles, creating forward 
thrust. The engine pushed the 
Concorde from takeoff speeds 
of 200 mph to Mach 2.04 
speeds, more than twice the 
speed of sound (Mach 1) and 
almost 1,400 mph.
The Concorde’s ability to 
achieve supersonic speed was 
partially thanks to the design 
of its body. The aircraft sat 
a hundred passengers and 
was not as spacious as usual 
100-seater planes. This is be-
cause the plane’s cabin had a 
small circumference, which 
mathematical models deter-
mined was optimal for such 
speeds. The wings of the plane 
resembled those of the Space 
Shuttle, yet were curved along 
their perimeter to reduce drag 
forces and generate more up-
lift. The plane’s long, sharp 
nose was a disadvantage for 
pilots when taking off, as it 
blocked their view. This was 
?xed by enabling the nose to 
adjust mechanically, referred 
to as a droop nose.
Supersonic speed came 
with many problems. The 
plane’s surface created so 
much friction with the fast-
moving air molecules that 
passengers admitted to feel-
ing heat on the window 
panes. Drag forces at such 
high speeds created incred-
ible stresses and strains on the 
body of the aircraft, causing it 
to bend up to two meters dur-
ing banking. Engineers solved 
this issue by adjusting the 
center of mass of the plane 
through the redistributing of 
fuel in the wings and tail.
The supersonic jet had to 
?y at high altitudes where 
the atmosphere is much less 
dense. At 60,000 feet, or 11 
miles into the air, the plane 
experienced much less drag 
force. Passengers noted that 
they could see the curvature of 
the Earth from such a height. 
In comparison, subsonic 
commercial planes ?y below 
30,000 feet. An extremely 
disastrous consequence of the 
Concorde’s high altitude was 
the damage its exhaust had 
on the ozone layer.
Another issue the 
Concorde dealt with was its 
sonic boom, the sound asso-
ciated with the shock waves 
left behind an object traveling 
faster than the speed of sound. 
It is caused when the sound 
waves, which travel at Mach 
1, that are emitted at the front 
of a supersonic object merge 
into one super shock wave, 
although the waves cannot 
move from the object’s path 
quickly enough. It resembles 
a loud crack, capable of shat-
tering windows below. The 
airliner was not allowed to 
reach supersonic speeds until 
it was above ocean for these 
reasons.
The Concorde demon-
strated how engineering, and 
especially international col-
laboration in engineering, 
can produce cutting-edge 
technology. It also proved 
to us that the world can be 
made even smaller, and travel 
more time-effective. Yet, it re-
minded us that no matter how 
much a product pushes the 
envelope, it will not last if it 
does not have a good business 
model. Running a supersonic 
commercial jet was unimagin-
ably costly, with many faulty 
parts and expensive tickets. 
A fatal crash of the Concorde 
in 2000 also withdrew public 
support for the plane.
Today, planes ?y well 
below the speed of sound 
and, to many, it seems a 
downgrade. Until a super-
sonic jet is designed that ad-
dresses the engineering and 
business issues the Concorde 
faced, we will live in the avia-
tion stone age, spending six 
hours in transit from New 
York to London. Startups like 
Boom and organizations like 
NASA are tackling the chal-
lenges the Concorde faced. 
Supersonic ?ight may thus be 
within reach in the coming 
years.
The Concorde was once the fastest airliner to ?y
HOW THINGS WORK
JOSH ANDAH
SciTech Editor
Carnegie Mellon Ph.D. 
candidate Madeline 
Gannon combined her 
creativity with computa-
tional design knowledge 
for her project, Mimus. 
On display in a glass box 
at the Design Museum 
London is an ABB IRB 
6700 robot, normally 
found on assembly lines 
in factories. The robot 
interacts with passersby 
much like a curious ani-
mal in a zoo does, bring-
ing it to life. The Design 
Museum has displayed 
contemporary art related 
to industrial design for 
almost four decades. The 
exhibition is titled [Fear 
and Love: Reactions to a 
Complex World.]
Gannon wishes to high-
light the empathy humans 
can develop with robots. 
“Creating new ways to 
communicate with ma-
chines is my passion,” 
said Gannon in a Carn-
egie Mellon press release. 
“When something re-
sponds to us with lifelike 
movements — even when 
it is clearly an inanimate 
object — we, as humans, 
cannot help but project 
our emotions onto it.”
The name “Mimus” is 
derived from the Latin 
word for mimic and a gens 
of the bird family, high-
lighting its mirror-like 
and its sentient behavior. 
As robots become more in-
tertwined in our everyday 
lives, the need for them to 
react normally to human 
interaction will increase. 
Autodesk vice president 
Amar Hanspal commented 
on Mimus and the connec-
tion between machines 
and people, saying “Mad-
eline and Mimus highlight 
how that new relationship 
can emerge.” Justin Mc-
Guirk, chief curator for 
the Design Museum, also 
said “One starts to get the 
sense of how robots may 
behave in the future.”
“When 
something 
responds to us 
with lifelike 
movements 
— even when 
it is clearly 
an inanimate 
object — we, as 
humans, cannot 
help but project 
our emotions 
onto it.”
-Madeline Gannon
Carnegie Mellon 
Ph.D. candidate 
The robot relies on 
gesture-based software 
and depth sensors to de-
termine its actions. It then 
uses simulation algorithms 
to determine its reactions; 
nothing is premeditated. 
Other students and 
alumni helped in creating 
Mimus and the software 
that runs it, including Kev-
yn McPhail, Ben Snell, and 
Dan Moore.
Gannon’s work is a reply 
to the misunderstanding 
that came with automation 
and the job loss that fol-
lowed. 
Robots replaced facto-
ries workers at an alarm-
ing rate because they are 
more accurate, do not re-
quire wages and work at 
maximum performance for 
hours. Despite laying off 
workers, production has 
grown at a 2.2 percent rate 
per year since 2002. 
Gannon, known as the 
Robot Whisperer, has 
shared her work on the 
internet to raise public 
awareness of the achieve-
ments being made in hu-
man-computer interaction. 
This is curcial because au-
tomation is here to stay, 
from autonomous vehicles 
to medical robots.
The exhibition is open 
until April 23, and there 
are 11 other installations 
alongside Mimus that fo-
cus on modern-world ad-
vances.

Women’s Swimming & Diving
The Carnegie Mellon 
University women’s swim-
ming and diving team ?nished 
competition at the University 
Athletic Association (UAA) 
Championships on Saturday, 
Feb. 11 at the University of 
Chicago. Two more school 
records were set as the Tartans 
surged forward on the last day 
to move into fourth place with 
Emory University winning the 
team title.
Junior Kim Hochstedler 
continued her great weekend 
with a fourth-place ?nish in 
the 200-yard breaststroke. She 
?nished the ?nals with a time 
of 2:21.65 but was even better 
in the preliminaries when she 
touched in a school record and 
career-best time of 2:20.51. 
Her time also surpassed last 
year’s invited time to the 
NCAA Championships.
Sophomore Cassidy 
Smith joined Hochstedler 
in the ?nals of the 200-yard 
breaststroke and ?nished ?fth 
overall in a career-best and 
NCAA provisional qualifying 
time of 2:22.26.
First-year Emma Nicklas-
Morris set her second school 
record of the meet when 
she touched in 2:04.25 to

Women’s basketball breaks drought defeating Brandeis
ZEKE ROSENBERG
Senior Staffwriter
The Carnegie Mellon 
women’s basketball team 
began Alumni Weekend by 
putting away a wire-to-wire 
victory against the Brandeis 
Judges on Friday, snapping a 
four-game losing streak.
The Tartans moved their 
record to 16–5 overall and 
5–5 in the University Athletic 
Association (UAA) for the 
season.
The game started auspi-
ciously for the Tartans. Af-
ter winning the opening tip, 
the Tartans whipped the ball 
around the perimeter for the 
full shot clock, ?nally ?nd-
ing ?rst-year guard Makayla 
Filliere for a long three that 
found the bottom of the net.
Filliere added a jumper 
from the left corner and an-
other from the free throw line 
in an opening run that gave 
the Tartans an early 14–6 
lead.
It wasn’t all smooth sail-
ing for the Tartans. Their 
2–3 zone sti?ed plenty of 
Brandeis’ possessions, but it 
also created space for offen-
sive rebounds.
Brandeis was able to use 
a run built on several second 
chance points to climb all the 
way to 17–16 before the Tar-
tans put up a 9–2 run to stop 
the bleeding.
The Tartans did give up 
one more second chance 
bucket at the end of the ?rst 
quarter and went into the sec-
ond up 26–20.
The second quarter did 
not open well for Carnegie 
Mellon as a few turnovers let 
Brandeis cut the Tartans’ lead 
in half in the middle of the 
second quarter.
The tide turned as the Tar-
tans were getting more suc-
cessful with their rebound-
ing by going after missed 
shots more aggressively. In 
addition, senior center Lisa 
Murphy’s rim protection went 
from tough to dominant in the 
second quarter.
Even offensive rebounds 
were turning into dif?cult, 
contested shots that Brandeis 
wasn’t able to bury.
Murphy ?nished with 
seven blocks, completely cut-
ting off the restricted area for 
Brandeis players.
Offensively, Murphy 
helped key a 12–2 run that 
gave the Tartans a 43–30 lead 
at the half, including a layup 
that came off a drop step to 
cap off the run at the buzzer. 
No matter who Brandeis sent 
to stop Murphy in the post, 
Murphy was stronger and 
more able to take the precise 
steps necessary to play down 
low.
When Brandeis sent dou-
ble teams, Murphy was an ef-
fective playmaker, racking up 
four assists and plenty more 
hockey assists.
Brandeis had no answer 
for her on either end, and 
she was able to collect 15 re-
bounds and 22 points on only 
13 shots.
The Tartans also went on a 
run in the ?rst half of the third 
quarter, extending their lead 
to 20 points before the ?nal 
period began.
While Murphy was domi-
nant on the low block, the 
Tartans’ successful offense 
had a huge assist from excel-
lent three-point shooting, ?n-
ishing around 40 percent for 
the game.
Filliere ?nished hitting 
three of four from deep 
while sophomore guard Jenn 
Mayberger added another 
three. Carnegie Mellon’s ball 
movement stood in stark con-
trast the more dribble-based 
play from the Judges and it 
showed in the shooting stats.
In all, the Tartans’ nine 
shots made out of 23 attempts 
from three point range tow-
ered over Brandeis’s two out 
of 10 and the difference was 
more than the margin of 
victory.
The Tartans will continue 
their season on Friday, Feb. 17 
when they take on Rochester 
in a rematch of their game on 
Jan. 20. The Tartans won that 
game at home 71–62.

Men’s basketball duplicates twin wins against UAA foes
MARIKA YANG
Assistant Sports Editor
On Friday, the Carn-
egie Mellon men’s bas-
ketball team battled the 
Brandeis University Judges 
in a University Athletic 
Association (UAA) rivalry 
game, coming away with the 
victory.
The game began with the 
Judges making two three-
pointers and building a fast 
lead. Both teams established 
the quick pace of the game 
with powerful defensive 
play. At 15:29, a dunk by se-
nior center Chris Shkil on a 
fast break opened the game 
up the Tartans, who soon 
scored several consecutive 
baskets to take the lead early 
in the ?rst half. Though the 
Tartans missed several second 
chance shots after offensive 
rebounds, they continued 
to play aggressively on both 
sides of the ball. With precise 
passing in the paint and by 
taking advantage of chances 
at the free throw line, the 
Tartans maintained a small 
lead. Three quarters of the 
way through the half, the 
quick scoring slowed down, 
and the defense took over the 
game. The Judges evened the 
score twice, but the Tartans 
found a way to take the lead 
both times. Sophomore for-
ward and guard Seth Henry 
scored a three-pointer at the 
end of the half, just beating 
the buzzer. Carnegie Mellon 
led 37–29.
Carnegie Mellon scored 
the ?rst points of the second 
half, amassing a 17-point 
lead early, with the Tartans’ 
offense taking control of the 
game as it had in the ?rst half. 
Though the Tartans sustained 
a double-digit advantage 
over Brandeis for much of the 
half, the Judges inched their 
way back, scoring 10 points 
to 1, and by the midpoint, 
had closed in on the Tartan’s 
lead. At 10:36, a technical 
foul by the Carnegie Mellon 
coach allowed the Judges 
to cut the de?cit to 9 points. 
The Tartans refused to let the 
Judges take over the game, 
surging to score 13 unan-
swered points and building a 
22-point lead with 6:39 left to 
play. The Tartans had as much 
as a 24-point lead as the game 
came to a close. They held on 
to win 78–64.
Senior forward Jack 
Serbin and Shkil both re-
corded double-doubles. Af-
ter being named the UAA 
Athlete of the Week on Tues-
day, Serbin scored 16 points 
with 16 rebounds. Shkil led 
the team with 21 points and 
added 12 rebounds. As a 
team, Carnegie Mellon had a 
better night statistically than 
Brandeis, with a 45 percent 
?eld goal rate compared to 
the Judges’ 36.5 percent. The 
Tartans also had more re-
bounds, 42 to 31, assists, 16 
to 12, second chance points, 
10 to 2, and points in the 
paint, 26 to 12. The Judges’ 
?eld goal percentage in three-
pointers was 42.3 percent, 
much higher than the Tartans’ 
27.3 percent, and they took 
more three-point shots over-
all. However, the Tartans 
committed fewer turnovers 
and scored more points off of 
turnovers than Brandeis did. 
Leading for most of the game, 
the Carnegie Mellon men’s 
basketball team had a domi-
nant performance over the 
Brandeis Judges.
On Sunday, the Tartans 
took on New York University. 
The Tartans  came away with 
a 94–58 victory, bringing 
their record to 13–9 overall 
and 7–4 in the UAA.
After a missed three-
pointer by NYU to start the 
game, Shkil made a layup 
off a Serbin assist, and the 
Tartans never looked back. 
After NYU’s ?rst points an-
swered the Tartans’ ten, se-
nior forward Joseph Cossins’ 
?rst long ball on the ensuing 
possession put the Tartans 
ahead 13–3 and never saw the 
lead dip below double digits 
the rest of the day. Carnegie 
Mellon’s largest lead of the 
?rst half came in the closing 
second of play when junior 
guard Ryan Maha scored on 
a layup, as the teams went 
into the locker room with the 
score 47–22. Carnegie Mellon 
started the second half mak-
ing eight of its ?rst 10 shots 
and led 67–33 with 13:28 to 
play. With 4:46 to play, a fast 
break layup by Shkil gave the 
Tartans their largest lead of 
the game at 88–46. Carnegie 
Mellon shot a season-best 
57.6 percent from the ?oor 
while holding the Violets to 
31.3 percent from the ?oor.
Serbin grabbed a game-
high 13 rebounds to record his 
third straight double-double 
and UAA leading 14th. Shkil 
chipped in with 16 points, had 
eight rebounds, and recorded 
four blocks in the win.
The team continues the 
season against the Univer-
sity of Rochester at 8 p.m. on 
Friday, Feb. 17.

Super Bowl advertisements venture into political realm
IAN TANAYA
Sports Editor
On Sunday, Feb. 5, 111.3 
million people with almost as 
many levels of football knowl-
edge watched Super Bowl LI. 
The game started as a blowout 
for the Atlanta Falcons, but the 
New England Patriots man-
aged to pull off the biggest 
comeback in Super Bowl his-
tory, forcing overtime for the 
?rst time in the Super Bowl en 
route to their ?fth Super Bowl 
victory.
The outcome generated a 
number of awkward moments 
with NFL Commissioner Roger 
Goodell, perhaps the most ?t-
ting response for the way he 
handled the 2015 De?ategate 
scandal.
For quite a large portion of 
the time, the game itself was 
rather boring, so the other 
aspects of the big game took 
the stage. The halftime show 
headlined by Lady Gaga most 
certainly drew the attention of 
fans and detractors alike, even 
if others like me were more 
invested in taking the oppor-
tunity to prepare something 
to eat or use the bathroom in-
stead.
However, the halftime 
show still took up only the 
time between the end of the 
second quarter and the start of 
the third.
For those who wanted en-
tertainment during the game 
but either didn’t care enough 
about football or just weren’t 
interested in the game being 
played out, the ads were the 
spotlight of the show.
According to a 2014 sur-
vey conducted by ad agency 
Venables Bell & Partners, 78 
percent of Americans look for-
ward to the commercials more 
than the game itself.
In an age where ad block-
ing is popular and advertisers 
are seen as annoying and po-
tentially compromising safety, 
it’s almost as if the Super Bowl 
is a holiday for advertising, 
the one day in the year people 
will accommodate advertise-
ments as an essential part of 
the whole experience. It’s no 
wonder the price for a 30 sec-
ond ad spot has reached $5 
million.
For years, the top advertise-
ments in the Super Bowl have 
generally revolved around 
comedy and animals. Howev-
er, it seems this year’s ads have 
been headlined by the politi-
cal tones surrounding them. 
An Audi ad featured a father 
considering how his daughter 
would be viewed as less valu-
able than a man to highlight 
the wage gap between men 
and women. A Budweiser ad 
which showcased the story of 
its founder’s path to achieving 
the American Dream gener-
ated boycott threats over its 
tone on the value of immigra-
tion. 10 Haircare urged view-
ers to make up for “four years 
of awful hair,” a humorous 
reference to President Trump’s 
infamous hair.
Perhaps the most 
controversial ad came from 84 
Lumber. Titled “The Journey”, 
the ad showed a mother and 
a daughter journeying across 
the Mexican desert on the way 
to the United States. Viewing 
the full ad online reveals that 
they eventually reach an im-
passe in the form of a wall, but 
manage to sneak in through 
a door made from 84 Lumber 
materials. “The will to succeed 
is always welcomed here,” 
closed out the ad. The tumul-
tuous election cycle that led 
to Trump’s electoral win over 
Democratic nominee Hillary 
Clinton has no doubt shone a 
greater focus onto the issues 
facing the country, and it’s no 
secret that the NFL has been a 
part of politics for years.
In 2014, the St. Louis Rams 
(now Los Angeles Rams) made 
hands up gestures in reference 
to the “Hands Up, Don’t Shoot” 
cry that drove protests in Fer-
guson following the death of 
Michael Brown. San Francisco 
49ers quarterback Colin Kae-
pernick has been well docu-
mented for his protest of the 
national anthem.
Many fans were enraged 
when the NFL denied a re-
quest by the Dallas Cowboys 
to wear stickers in support of 
the Dallas Police Department.
It seems that politics have 
become entwined in football, 
and this is now showing in the 
way companies have been ap-
proaching ads.
Quite a number of ads 
stuck with the tried and true 
formula of comedy and light-
hearted presentations with 
celebrities to push their com-
panies’ products. However, it 
seems like a greater number of 
people are focused on politics 
now that Donald Trump has 
become the president of the 
United States.
Whether this is good or bad 
depends on perspective. Some 
people would prefer having 
politics out of their entertain-
ment, while others might 
welcome any avenue that pro-
motes discussion about the is-
sues the country is facing.
The world has certainly 
recognized the gravity of re-
cent events.
Perhaps it is time the Super 
Bowl recognized it too.

Advice for Awkward People
On the woes of dating
Dear Shanley and Rachel,
So the CIT Ball is coming up this week, and I’m 
super pumped to go. The thing is, I know that the 
guy usually asks the girl… But I was so excited 
about the ball that I thought that maybe I should 
be the one to ask a guy. In a panic with only a 
week until the ball, I decided to ask one of my 
close guy friends. I guess I may have made TOO 
big of a deal about it, because I went all out 
on asking him. I went to the store and bought 
balloons, then I talked to his roommate so I could 
put them in there to surprise him. I’ve never 
asked anyone to a dance before, so I thought that 
I should make it magical. I guess I made it TOO 
magical, because he came back to his dorm and 
freaked out, yelling, “Who are you? Why are you 
in my room? Get out!” I guess we weren’t as close 
friends as I thought. I want to go to the ball with a 
guy, but I guess I’m lost on how to ask someone. 
Any ideas on how I should ask in the future?
Sincerely,
Dates Are Tough, Even Laid-back Events Seriously Suck
Hello DATELESS,
I am so sorry that asking your guy out didn’t work. 
But don’t let that get you down! Being awkward 
isn’t easy, and trust me, I’ve been in that awkward 
stage before. I recommend that maybe you should 
ask more casually, especially if you’re asking a 
friend. Besides, if you go with one of your guy 
friends then you guys can just have a good time 
with no pressure. Maybe next time go to one 
of your friends and say, “I heard the CIT ball is 
coming up next week, and I was wondering if you 
think it’d be chill if we went together.” That way 
it is very casual so even if you do get rejected it’s 
not that big of a deal. But even if another guy says 
no, don’t take it personally! There are plenty fish 
in the Carnegie sea.
From yours truly,
Shanley and Rachel
Dear Ruth, 
The other night, I went on a date with a cute boy 
and we had a great time over dinner and drinks. 
We went back over to my place, one thing led to 
another, and well... you know how it goes. The 
next morning, however, I was in a pickle because 
as someone not on birth control, I had to quickly 
run to my nearby CVS and purchase Plan B. Did you 
know Plan B is $50?! That’s ridiculous. Anyway, 
I let the boy know about that situation. However, 
I lowkey think he should help me out with 
paying for the Plan B. I mean, we both decided 
unprotected sex was a risk worth taking, and it 
does take two to make a baby. Should I ask him to 
go halvsies with me on the Plan B pill?
Sincerely,
Pay A Little And No Babies
Hello PLAN B,
Our society and the medical community like to put 
the vast majority of birth control responsibility on 
women. The only male-specific form that’s even 
commercially available right now is condoms, 
and I’ll be honest, I know a lot of women who 
keep their own supply just in case. This is, I think, 
totally B.S. Just because one party faces a lot 
more risk if conception actually happens doesn’t 
mean everyone involved shouldn’t take equal 
responsibility. So yes, you should absolutely 
ask him to go halvsies on your Plan B; and if he 
complains, remind him that it’s way less expensive 
than going halvsies on raising a child. (Also, pro-
tip: generic is only $30.)
Get some safely,
Ruth
Zeke Rosenberg | Contributing Editor
Ariel Hoffmaier | StaffwriterBar Buddies: Squirrel Hill Cafe
A new weekly column reviewing student’s options for inebriation
Zeke and I originally planned to start off this 
column with an exciting bar in an exciting 
neighborhood. But when Zeke was an hour late 
(although he insists he was only 49 minutes late) 
and we had no mixers but cinnamon-apple tea and 
the world was an icy wasteland of frozen dreams, 
we decided to walk down the street to Squirrel 
Hill Cafe.
The location: Outside of Oakland, which is 
dominated by Pitt students (oh the horror), Squirrel 
Hill Cafe might be the most accessible bar from 
campus. Just hop on any 61 bus and you’ll end 
up right across the street from its friendly red 
neon sign. In one of the safest (read: overrun by 
children) neighborhoods in Pittsburgh, this bar is 
where the locals kick back with their buddies after 
a long day at work. 
Be warned, though, Squirrel Hill Cafe is pretty 
much the only bar in the neighborhood (exception: 
that one sports bar, which Zeke will never drag me 
to). Find a good table and expect this to be your 
base for the night.
The drinks: Sit down for five minutes and a waiter 
will actually come to you. This isn’t the place to 
order anything fancy, but they’re good on your 
basics. Since I never drink beer unless it’s free 
from a keg, I ordered a whiskey sour and Zeke 
ordered a gin and tonic. It’s hard to mess up a 
gin and tonic, and I’m relieved to say they didn’t. 
The main thing the cocktail menu has going for it 
is the price. I was shocked when the bill came out 
to about $3.50 a drink. Hard to ask for a better 
deal, especially if you’re talking to a couple New 
Yorkers. The last time we went drinking, over break 
in Manhattan, we accidentally purchased Long 
Island ice teas for $17 a pop. Needless to say, this 
was a better night for us.
The vibe: You probably won’t make any new 
friends here, and if you’re prowling for booty you 
might want to look elsewhere. But for a casual 
night with friends, Squirrel Hill Cafe is ideal. The 
noise level is minimal and music is unobtrusive. 
Bigger groups can grab one of a few tables, while 
we got our pick of cozy little booths. They’re 
built for two people who’d actually like to talk 
to each other, but might also be appropriate for 
anyone who’d rather sip at their Jameson neat and 
contemplate loneliness. We had ample opportunity 
to talk our way ever closer and tipsier toward the 
topic of our impending futures, a favorite hobby of 
all graduating seniors.
Lit or Nah: Nah, but that’s sort of this bar’s 
appeal. If you can accept smelling like an 
ashtray until your next shower, Squirrel Hill Cafe 
is the perfect bar for cheap drinks and easy 
conversation with some good company.
On the other hand, Zeke did want to mention that 
$3 drinks are exceptionally lit.
They’ve also got food, but only until midnight. So 
after last call, we headed over to the only place 
open in Squirrel Hill at two in the morning: Eat n’ 
Park. Nothing beats a heaping plate of mediocre 
diner fries at an hour any normal person should 
be sleeping. Or a full serving of straight cottage 
cheese, if you’re the same brand of weirdo 
as Zeke.

Every time I’ve walked into a movie theatre in the 
past three months, I’ve been reminded at least 
once that LEGO Batman would be coming out in 
mid-February, suspiciously near the holiday filled 
with love, public displays of affection, overpriced 
heart-shaped chocolate boxes, and, for some, the 
stinging sensation telling them that they are still 
single and that’s not okay. Thankfully, the movie 
trailer did not once mention the fact that V-day 
is approaching. It seemed to be a perfectly inno-
cent movie about a superhero learning to team 
up with ordinary people to fight bad guys, plus 
a few superhero jokes that only teenagers could 
truly appreciate. So I went, only expecting to be 
entertained.
I was undoubtedly entertained by the flashing 
colors and deafening sound coming from the 
impressive sound system of the IMAX theatre. I 
was slightly disappointed when I found that con-
structing different objects using LEGO blocks — a 
prominent theme in the first LEGO movie — was 
only used as a creative form of presenting the 
Batman story, but I should have seen it coming. 
After all, this is LEGO Batman, where “LEGO” is 
only the adjective, nothing more. There are only a 
few references to building weapons and automo-
biles scattered throughout the movie. This movie is 
basically a Batman movie stripped of all serious-
ness and smoothness, accompanied by Batman’s 
brutally honest statements about his socially unac-
ceptable true nature.
Just like any other superhero movie, Batman, 
again, saves the entire city of Gotham and every-
one’s a** five minutes into the movie by defusing 
Joker’s bomb, which was intended to blow up 
the entire world. After singlehandedly defeating 
an entire army of villains, Batman returns to the 
Batcave in a swarm of praise and awe, with a 
news reporter’s voice echoing, “It must be great 
to be Batman — I can only imagine he’s going 
home now to party the night away, surrounded 
by friends and lady activewear models!”
The music slowed, and the lights dimmed. 
I was now watching Batman returning 
after one (short) day of victory to 
his home inhabited by two and half 
people: his butler Alfred, Batman himself, 
and his computer. The enormous, high-tech, 
lavish residence on an 
isolated island seemed 
to provide Batman 
with nothing more than 
boredom and loneli-
ness. Just like any tired 
employer who returns 
to their empty apartment at the end of the day, 
Batman walks into his home, warms up food left 
in the fridge by Alfred, sits in front of his televi-
sion, and starts watching a romantic comedy. 
This is the recurring theme throughout the entire 
movie. It starts with Batman being lonely in his 
cave, then extends to him staring sentimentally at 
his family photo, defensively answering Alfred’s 
question about his greatest fear, and clumsily 
teaching his adopted teenager to behave.
We get it: Batman has emotions, and he is simply 
a vulnerable, normal human being under his shell.
But the movie went even further. After telling 
Joker how unimportant he is and consequently 
breaking his heart, Batman reveals his ultimate 
vulnerability: without someone who he can pas-
sionately hate and chase after, he is bored 
and disoriented. Always working and claiming 
victories alone, Batman suddenly can no longer 
fight crimes without the presence of a team or a 
family. While it is not a crime to use these cheesy 
coincidences to make a point, nor does anyone 
really care about the plot consistency of a “kids’ 
movie,” I do find some aspects of the movie 
unsettling, especially the one emphasizing the 
importance of having the one to make you happy 
or successful. Somehow singlehandedly fighting 
villains and wanting to celebrate victory 
by spending time alone is less 
okay and satisfactory than 
sharing it with loved 
ones; somehow 
one cannot live 
to the fullest 
without the 
one that 
they love (or, in this case, hate) whole-heartedly. 
This is proven by the ending scene where Batman 
lets a team of villains, including the Joker, walk 
away in the face of the police after expending 
tremendous efforts to hunt them down. Under the 
lighthearted and somewhat cynical humor lies the 
constant reminder that being alone is really not 
okay.
Someone who thinks they care about you and 
understand you will come knocking on your door, 
asking you whether you are okay; even if you 
are perfectly okay at the beginning, you feel less 
okay after you hear their questions. Next thing 
you know, you are already questioning yourself. 
“Why did they ask me if I was okay?” “There 
must be something wrong with me.” No. There’s 
nothing wrong with you, or being alone. There 
are two types of LEGO movie fans: the people 
who like LEGO Batman — a romantic comedy 
masked in a superhero costume shaped like a 
patchwork of cubes — and the people who like 
the first LEGO movie, because we understand that 
not “everything is great when you are part of a 
team.” While you’re sympathizing with the new 
LEGO Batman movie, don’t forget that some of us 
are born to be superheroes and need no mask of 
disguise. We can feel happiness by being alone, 
in fact, just as much as by having that special one 
to rely on.
The LEGO Batman Movie
Yet another movie to remind you of the social norms

Something that makes Pittsburgh so unique is its interdisciplinary culture, 
with the sciences, the arts, and technology all in one place. From all the 
public art installations throughout the city to the self-driving cars that roam 
the streets, these are the kinds of things that really define Pittsburgh. But 
the most fascinating sights are the ones that combine the very different 
fields of science, art, and technology. A great example of that is a current 
art exhibit being displayed here on campus, titled Hacking/Modding/
Remixing as Feminist Protest. This exhibit, presented at The Miller Gallery 
in The Purnell Center for the arts, will be showing until Feb. 26 and has 
been organized by Angela Washko, a visiting Assistant Professor in the 
art department of the College of Fine Arts.
Hacking/Modding/Remixing features mixed media works of various artists 
that communicate themes and issues raised by the feminist movement. The 
exhibit itself takes up about three floors in the gallery, with each floor rep-
resenting one of three different takes on technological art: hacking, mod-
ding, and remixing. The first floor essentially provides a preview for the 
themes and artwork seen later in the exhibit. It features a little pink setup 
for visitors to play video games at the side of the entrance and a room 
showing various videos that speak to the topics of equal rights and gender 
roles, specifically using clips from popular films and TV shows.
The pieces on the second floor exhibited the hacking/modding aspect, 
where all the works focused on the concept of coding, and how it can 
be used as a tool for transforming the functions of common devices. For 
example, one of the pieces on the second floor was a short “mobile 
poem,” titled “Dear Sirs”, that was presented on a Nintendo DS. The 
main idea was to have the viewer physically interact with the text, and 
hopefully find a hidden message within the poem. Many of the other 
pieces on the floor were similar, where gaming systems were incorporated 
to both make the art more interactive and allow guests to think about how 
the digital world can influence people’s behavior.
The third floor was centered around the technique of remixing, where the 
artists utilized existing songs, videos, and pictures to communicate mes-
sages about politics, women’s rights, and the female body. All the graph-
ics and various forms of media being displayed throughout this floor defi-
nitely made all the pieces very eye-catching. All three floors of Hacking/
Modding/Remixing as Feminist Protest had a lot of information to share 
and powerful themes to express with visitors, but the exhibit didn’t just end 
there. On Friday, Feb. 10th, there was a special extended event to the 
exhibit at The Andy Warhol Museum. The event included a presentation of 
multiple abstract videos, all focused on the same topics addressed in The 
Miller Gallery exhibit. There was a live performance by video and perfor-
mance artist, Ann Hirsch, in which she taught the audience “How to Get

reality TV show Frank the Entertainer in a Basement Affair. All the content in this 
event addressed the many issues associated with women’s rights, sexuality, and 
how they are viewed in society. The videos explicitly presented the major influ-
ence social media has on the portrayal of women in popular culture today, and 
without a doubt helped the audience see all these effects from the perspectives 
of the female artists featured in the event.
The entire Hacking/Modding/Remixing as Feminist Protest exhibit really makes 
its guests think. Guests can learn more about the hidden meanings behind vari-
ous forms of entertainment, and how they contribute to shaping gender roles 
in society. It can also allow guests to open their eyes to new perspectives and 
emotionally experience issues regarding discrimination and violations of equal 
rights, that so many people have dealt with, and continue to deal with today. 
It’s a sight that is truly inspiring and certainly worth visiting.

Ah, love is the air. After a long day of classes, meetings, and homework, you slow down as 
you stop to think about your plans — or lack thereof — to celebrate this special time of year. You 
reach into your wallet and realize you have no cash. You look outside your window and watch 
the snow fall, listening to the wind howl mercilessly. Or maybe you’re outside and you’re really 
cold and really hungry. What you want is an affordable, cozy, and enjoyable experience this 
year, whether it’s with a special someone or just yourself. Why not treat your sweetheart (or 
yourself) to an intimate dinner? We have a simple yet decedent three-course meal that will satisfy 
your stomach while being kind to your wallet (and busy schedule).
Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms
Ingredients: 
1/8 cup Italian-style dried bread crumbs
1/8 cup grated Pecorino Romano
1/2 garlic clove, peeled and minced
1/2 tablespoon (tbs) of chopped fresh 
parsley leaves
Salt and freshly ground black pepper
1/12 cup extra-virgin olive oil
7 large (2 1/2 inch diameter) white mushrooms, 
stemmed
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees 
C). Clean off mushrooms with a damp paper towel, 
carefully break off mushroom stems. Chop the stems 
into itsy-bitsy, eensy-weensy pieces.
Stir the bread crumbs, Pecorino Romano, garlic, 
parsley, chopped mushroom stems, salt and pepper 
to taste, and 2 tablespoons olive oil in a medium 
bowl. This will be the filling. Remember to taste the 
mixture to make sure it’s delicious!
Drizzle a heavy large baking sheet with about 1 
tablespoon olive oil, to coat. Or you can just use 
parchment paper.
Spoon the filling into the mushroom cavities and 
arrange on the baking sheet, cavity side up. Drizzle 
remaining oil over the filling in each mushroom. 
Sprinkle more breadcrumbs over each mushroom 
if you’re feeling fancy. Place the sheet in the oven 
and bake until the mushrooms are tender and the 
filling is heated through and golden on top, about 
25 minutes.

Dessert: Spiced Drinking Chocolate
Ingredients:
2 cups milk (any kind of milk will do, though 
whole milk would be insanely rich. I use a mix of 
coconut and almond milk.)
2 cups dark chocolate chips
1 tsp cinnamon
a pinch of nutmeg 
1/2 tsp cayenne
1/2 tsp of whatever other spices you want! The 
joy of this dish is that it’s easy to personalize.
1 tsp vanilla extract
1 can coconut milk
Pop that can of coconut milk in the fridge to 
chill so the cream and liquid separate. Use the 
freezer if you’re in a time crunch.
Pour the milk in a medium or large pot and 
bring to a simmer.
Add the chocolate and spices and whisk briskly 
till everything is combined. Add more chocolate 
if you’d like the drink thicker or more milk if it 
seems too rich.
Once combined, remove from heat and stir in 
vanilla extract.
Just before serving, scoop the cream from the 
top of the coconut milk into a chilled bowl and 
whip into whipped cream with an electric mixer 
(don’t try to do this by hand no matter how buff 
you are). Top your drinks with the cream and 
serve. Yum!
Entree: Creamy Fettuccine Pasta
Ingredients:
3 quarts water
1 tbs butter
2 garlic cloves, minced and divided
1 1/2 cups (2-inch) diagonally cut asparagus
6 ounces uncooked fettuccine
2 teaspoons (tsp) olive oil
1/3 cup finely chopped sweet onion
1 lemon
1 tbs all-purpose flour
1/4 cup fat-free, lower-sodium chicken broth
1 cup 1 percent low-fat milk
1 ounce Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, grated 
(about 1/4 cup packed)
3 ounces of less-fat cream cheese
1/2 tsp kosher salt
1/4 tsp freshly ground black pepper
2 tbs chopped fresh tarragon
Bring 3 quarts water to a boil in a pot.
Add asparagus to boiling water; cook for 3 min-
utes or until crisp-tender. Remove cooked aspara-
gus from the pot with a slotted spoon. Rinse them 
under cold water and drain.
Add pasta to boiling water. Cook for 10 min-
utes or until al dente. Drain and keep warm, 
drizzle olive oil onto it to prevent the noodles 
from sticking.
Heat olive oil in skillet over medium heat. Add 
onion and the 2 garlic cloves, and cook for 3 min-
utes or until tender, stirring frequently. Place the 
flour in a small bowl and gradually whisk in the 
chicken broth. Add broth mixture and milk to the 
pan, stirring constantly with a whisk. Bring it to a 
boil and then reduce heat. Cook for an additional 
minute or until it thickens. Remove the sauce from 
heat, and add the cheeses, salt, and pepper to 
taste. Stir until cheeses melt, then stir in the juice 
of ½ a lemon. Add pasta and asparagus, tossing 
well. Sprinkle with tarragon and serve.

art by Aisha Han | Visual EditorLee Hazlewood’s 13
Rerelease of 13 revives a timecapsul of 70’s paranoia
Light in the Attic Records just  
rereleased Lee Hazlewood’s out-of-
print 1972 album 13, a work rooted 
in the political turmoil, cynicism, and 
paranoia of the early 70s during 
Nixon. Hazlewood, best known for 
producing Nancy Sinatra’s “These 
Boots Are Made for Walkin,’” recorded 
many solo albums in the 60s and 70s, 
characterized by his distinctive baritone 
voice and idiosyncratic production skills 
on lush lounge, bubblegum pop music, and 
folky, country tunes. 13 stands out rather starkly 
in musical direction from Hazlewood’s other albums as he explores the soul-funk 
idiom. While the songs feature the type of seedy characters often found on his 
records, the seediness is especially pronounced on 13 as funk instrumentation 
like fuzz and wah-wah guitar with brass, organ, elastic bass, and a solid beat 
provides music reminiscent of the era’s grindhouse films.
 13 originally only saw release in a limited number of countries excluding the 
United States. It was released on CD in the early 2000s, but again on a limited 
basis, so this is the first time that the album is widely available. Hazlewood 
lived and worked in the U.S., throughout the 60s, but started traveling the 
world on the business of his independent production label Lee Hazlewood 
Industries (LHI). Fed up with what amounted to minor success in the U.S., 
Hazlewood found he had a following in Sweden and decided to settle there in 
the early 70s, becoming a recluse of sorts in self-imposed exile from Nixon’s 
America as he worked on a number of projects. It is out of this unique context 
that 13 was able to become the perfect musical example of early 70s drugged-
out paranoia and disillusionment with the prior decade’s idealism.
13 is R&B instead of Hazlewood’s usual styles because, before he went to 
Sweden, he hired musician Larry Marks to produce a contemporary R&B funk 
based style for LHI. Originally recorded as a Marks album in 1970, 13 got 
shelved due to LHI’s financial straits and lack of distribution. When Hazlewood 
left for Sweden, soon after working with Marks on the album, he took the unre-
leased 13’s tapes. In 1972, Hazlewood released a new version of 13, with his 
vocals replacing Marks’.
13, though it did not start out a Hazlewood album, still has much of the artist’s 
usual traits on the album. From the era and cover art alone, one can nearly 
tell that 13 is a masterpiece of early 70s burst-bubble hippiedom, a place 
for the idealism of flower power to choke on the polluted haze of “stonery” 
non-conformist angst and paranoia. The cover art shows the center of a dart 
board with Hazlewood’s head right under it, surrounded in the background 
by darts, presumably thrown daringly around his cranium. Besides immediate 
humor, such an absurd photograph is likely a joke that Hazlewood is hardly in 
the same category of fame or influence as the assassinated political leaders of 
the era like Martin Luther King, Jr. and President John F. Kennedy or of then 
recently-deceased rockers like Jimmy Hendrix who were also thought to pos-
sibly have been killed by “The Man.” Furthering the paranoid interpretation of 
the album cover is Hazlewood’s change in appearance from his typically fancily 
dressed, shorthaired, and mustachioed look to a hippie look wearing a plain 
navy blue sweater with long hair and no mustache. The number 13 that gives 
the album its title also lends it weight toward such an interpretation of tongue-in-
cheek paranoia as Jesus had 12 apostles making him the ‘13th’ person, ripe to 
be crucified.
Hazlewood was nothing if not a tasteful user of kitsch. Although funk was 
revered by critics in 1972, there were plenty of cash-in attempts in the genre, 
as session musicians were hired to compile libraries of ready-made funky music 
for soundtracks to films and commercials. It is this contemporary kitsch-funk that 
one is reminded when hearing the opening of 13 as the lead track “You Look 
Like a Lady” kicks off with propulsive horns and a heavily funky rhythm section. 
Such musical elements may seem a bit dated since much pop music of that era 
was similar due to crossover influence of black music and the massive success 
of horn-driven bands like Chicago. However, pop artists would not have tried to 
emulate this sound were it not a pretty groovy sound that required high levels 
of musical ability. Still, one hardly expects to hear a voice like Hazlewood’s, 
suited to his own folk-country, to come out of such a heavy funk.
“You Look Like a Lady,” also displays Hazlewood’s classic sense of humor and 
the non-conformist “stonery” ethos of the album. For one thing, the idea of a 
person looking like a lady, but not necessarily being one has been used for 
comedic reasons, but also speaks to non-conformist identities like transgender-
ism and homosexuality, much like Lou Reed’s classic hit from the same year, 
“Walk on the Wild Side.” In addition to shattering taboos surrounding sexual-
ity, “You Look Like a Lady,” quickly establishes the album’s breaking of the 
taboo of drug references, the opening lines of the song and album being: “My 
head is bad / My mind is through / Ain’t been so stoned / Since I was new.” 
The song is about a drifter and one gets a sense of both the urgency 
of his movement and the deeper longing that he experiences.
The chill of the next song “Tulsa Sunday,” sets a 
pattern on the album of alternation between 
fast and slow tempo tunes. The song is 
slow funk, filled with building fuzz 
and guitar in addition to the 
floating and falling horns that 
traipse along to complement 
Hazlewood’s slow, almost 
drunken vocal. The song’s 
instrumental aspect 
alone might be enough 
to qualify it as drug 
referential, even 
without all its lyri-
cal assertions. In 
“Tulsa Sunday,” 
Hazlewood ser-
enades a myste-
rious “Priscilla,”

who may or may not be the person who “looks like a lady,” or, for that matter, 
may or may not be Elvis’ wife. He asks her to “Take a look at that sun, Priscilla, / 
don’t it make you want to fly? / take a look at that sky, Priscilla, / don’t it make 
you want to get high?” While it might be perfectly reasonable to dismiss these as 
banal stereotypical stoner lyrics that lack any substance, keep in mind that was 
kind of the point in the first place as Hazlewood puts his own perverse spin on 
the hippie drug culture through what are often intentionally exaggerated and 
stereotypical tropes.
Following the languor of “Tulsa Sunday,” is the upbeat “Ten or 11 Towns 
Ago,” which contains the line that may be most indicative of the album’s 
hippie nonsense ethos: “One week in San Francisco / Existing on Nabisco / 
cookies and bad dreams / sad scenes and dodging paranoia.” The line recalls 
San Francisco as the home of hippiedom, but beyond that, seems to be evocative 
of lines from the song “Truckin’” by that scene’s premier band, Grateful Dead: 
“Livin’ on reds, Vitamin C, and cocaine / all they can say is ain’t it a shame?” 
Whether Hazlewood is lampooning such cultural references or trying to make his 
own stab at them is up to each listener to guess, but this does not seem to be a 
song that takes itself too seriously.
 On what many describe as Hazlewood’s “soul album,” the track that is most dis-
cernibly soul is “And I Loved You Then.” It is heavily reminiscent of Isaac Hayes 
and fits the album’s narrative of a character that for all his movement is stuck in 
the same place. One does not generally think of Hazlewood as soul balladeer, but 
this is his stab at it and he sings on his own terms.
 13 ends on the funky “Hej, Me I’m Riding,” pronounced “hey.” The misspelling is 
once again that anti-grammar ideals of hippiedom rearing its head. It explains the 
background of the drifting speaker as someone whose brother died and father 
left, which is a timeless blues trope. Despite this, the narrator has managed to 
make a life for himself, his “riding,” being that he is on the ride of life. It is a sum-
mary of the album’s speaker’s situation, somebody with no real home, who is 
kind of just drifting along. In a sense, one might say that it was also a summary of 
Hazlewood’s situation at the time as he felt there was not much for him back home 
in the U.S, while Sweden could never really be his home.
 13, though not necessarily representative of his broader work, is still an essential 
Hazlewood album. Even though this is such a drastic production departure from 
his more typical symphonic orchestrations, he was known for quirky 
production, so the change isn’t totally out of place. Are you 
going to hear a great soul singer? No, but you are 
going to hear a highly unique singer on a great 
psychedelic pop and soul album filled 
with hazy 70s melancholy.

Dear Home
You fight dirty
You shoot your eyes like daggers at mine
On the phone, and when we fuck
A thousand times to push your luck
Show me who you are
Don’t tell me what you want
Its easy to fall and easier to stand
When you’re my only helping hand
Am I just lost?
Or did I find something special here
You lead me straight into the light
Even though it leaves me blind
My lungs fill with emptiness
In this twisted galaxy wrapped around your finger
I forget who I am every day
And I let you remake me from clay
From where we stand
I see the city lights down below
Other things seem small when I’m with you
I don’t want to fall — I’ll never let you go
You lob your bombs and fire your guns
I’ll catch them all till you’re done
Memories are made and lost in a day
When there are so many coming my way

CMU Contra Dance is hosted monthly in 
the Skibo Small Gym on Sundays from 5:30 
to 8:30 p.m. The events feature traditional 
French dances that invlove twirling, stomp-
ing, and hollering, all backed by some rock-
ing fiddle and drums. This week’s theme 
was “Sassafras Stomp,” while the event on 
the 12th of March is themed “Changeling.” 
Beginners are always welcome and the call-
er at the front of the room walks everyone 
through each dance at the beginning. While 
it’s a bit intimidating at first, once you get 
the hang of it you too will be jumping, skip-
ping, and clapping along with this eclectic 
and energetic cohort of traditional dance 
enthusiasts. More information on upcoming 
events is at facebook.com/catsdancepgh.
