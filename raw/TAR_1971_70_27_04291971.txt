Robbery Attempted
Security Thwarts Assailants
by SHERRY SUKOL
A strong-arm robbery occurred on Saturday in E tower of More- 
wood Gardens. Two male students reported to the main desk that 
they had seen two suspicious persons on the 7th floor of E. Tower. 
Mrs. Craig, stationed at the Main Desk, notified security immediate­
ly and Sgt. Schoettle and Officer Purifoy went to the scene of the 
crime and arrested the two suspects.
The victim, Ken Sobel, was alone in his room sitting at his desk, 
with the door to his room slightly ajar. Two males walked into 
the room at approximately 8:15 p.m. They asked Sobel who “Marchi” 
was, referring to a 1969 New York City Political poster which the 
victim had hanging in his room. They then asked, “if he had any 
grass that he could sell them.” When the victim replied that he 
didn’t, he was suddenly hit from behind.
While he had been talking to one of the men, the other had 
walked behind him and hit him on both sides of the face with his

Women and Biology Discussed
The newly restructured De­
partment of Biological Sciences, 
and the status of Women on the 
C-MU campus were the topics 
of discussion at Monday’s meet­
ing of the Educational Policy 
Council.
At the meeting, Dr. Robert 
Rice, who will officially be­
come the head of the Depart­
ment of Biological Sciences on 
July 1, distributed a description 
of the new department, a portion 
of which follows:
The new department will be 
housed entirely, insofar as its 
graduate research activities are 
concerned, within the splendid­
ly equipped Mellon Institute 
building. There will be close 
ties between chemistry and bio­
logy and the plan is to utilize 
our well equipped biochemistry 
and biophysics laboratories to 
the fullest extent possible. Some 
of these facilities include five 
electron microscopes, two ana- 
lytival ultracentrifuges, about a 
dozen preparative centrifuges, 
and virtually any other bio­
chemical equipment currently 
in use for biological research.
We will set up research pro­
grams in several areas of mo­
dern biology, start a graduate 
Ph.D. program, and lastly de­
velop an undergraduate program 
which will depend heavily upon 
chemistry, physics, and mathe­
matics in the first two years. 
The initial step will be to join 
the five to seven biochemists 
currently on the scene at Mellon 
Institute with possibly as many 
as five biologists to be recruited 
over the next two years.
At the present time, two bio­
logists have been hired, one from
the California Institute of Tech­
nology, and the other from the 
University of Wisconsin.
In the discussion that follow­
ed, Dr. Rice stressed the follow­
ing points:
1) The course, “Introduction 
to Cellular Biology,” will have 
only high school chemistry as a 
prerequisite so it will be an ex­
cellent H&SS science elective.
2) The course will have a 
section on ecology, but no un-

This Saturday, May 1st there 
will be a march and rally in 
Pittsburgh as part of a nation­
wide and worldwide demonstra­
tions in solidarity with the peace 
movement in South Vietnam. 
In Pittsburgh people will gath­
er at 10 a.m. at Soldiers and 
Sailors Hall (on Fifth Avenue 
across from the Pitt Cathedral) 
and march down to Point State 
Park for a rally, workshops and 
music. Childcare will be pro­
vided.
The demands of the demon­
stration are: All U.S. troops and 
material out of Southeast Asia 
Now on terms of the People’s 
Peace Treaty, $6,500 Guaran­
teed Annual Income for a family 
of four, and the freeing of all 
political prisoners. It is very im­
portant that all of us whf are 
and have been against this war 
take part in Saturday’s demon­
stration because people involved 
in the Vietnamese peace move­
ment feel coordinated actions 
between Americans and Viet­
namese starting May 1 can con­
cretely effect the course of 
the war. Mass demonstrations 
are planned in South Vietnam 
on May 3rd. (Notice the Viet­
namese cannot get a permit to 
demonstrate, we can). Nixon has 
declared May 1st National 
Loyalty Day—Show Nixon where 
your loyalty lies. MAYDAY!

know. Hands’ fingers raised 
again in the peace posture, per­
haps not quite so often this 
time, and perhaps at first gin­
gerly, but the trademark of a 
movement is not yet to te rele­
gated to memory. And eventu­
ally, the speeches. We’ve heard 
them uttered a thousand times, 
but then there is no more to 
say. Perceived truths admit of 
no amendations, only different 
accents, varied intonations.
Saturday’s event had all of the 
equipage of the peace march 
of yesteryear, a sixties’ proto­
type demonstration transported 
into the new age of the seven­
ties. But in time transit, some­
thing had been altered. The 
year of our idealistic despair 
had left its mark. Pervasively 
absent on April 24, in Washing­
ton, D.C. was an intangible, an 
aura of what might be crudely 
catalogued as hope. One was 
again awed by the magnitude of 
the assembled masses, but no 
longer did one rashly believe in 
the power of the righteous 
throng. The cry: “How can they 
h«lp but heed so many gather­
ed here together!” was not the 
cry of the hour, but rather a 
relic of a recent naivete.
The population of the spiritu­
al-political peace crusade is 
afoot again, probably boasting 
more disciples than ever before. 
April 24 may have witnessed 
the emotional rebirth of the 
effort. If so, it was a gentle 
birth, but early symptoms speak 
of a child of grim visage, denied 
the illusion of innocent optimism.
Washington...
by JON MANON
Returned, after a year’s tired, 
puzzled absence. Again to tread 
the now-worn Washington peace 
march path. New faces, but the 
same potpourri crowd, frustra- 
tion’w winter melting, a young 
resolve stretching anew its 
ossified limbs in the crisp spring 
sunlight. Attending again were
the myriad buttons, some famil­
iar veterans, some of recent 
vintage; striking especially the 
simple message: “enough.” Here 
were the deluge of leaflets, 
revolutionary newspapers hawk­
ed at every corner, billions of 
phrases of stale rhetoric and 
spontaneous honesty submitted 
to the wind or trampled under­
foot; few took time to read what 
they knew or had heard so often 
?hat they thought they must

LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
EROS
Dear TARTAN Editor:
Being a new faculty member 
at CMU, I “went down to the 
Fair” at Spring Carnival on 
Thursday evening. It was a show 
successfully designed to delight 
children and others still young 
enough in heart to partake in 
senseless fantasy. Many devoted 
students had apparently spent 
much time, constructing the 
booths, whose sum far surpassed 
the rejected floats of the Rose 
Bowl Parade.
But, if fairs of this kind are 
intended to be the sublimated 
replacement for more healthy 
and grossly physical May Pole 
ecstasies, there was one trouble­
some element. On entering the 
fair, the first booth must have 
both puzzled and amazed any 
person of compassion. Across the 
top of the booth was a sign read­
ing, “Kill A Commie For Mom- 
nie” and above that is vicious 
white eagle attacking success­
fully a Russian statist emblem. 
The booth offered the opportun­
ity for the frustrated, militant 
undergraduate (or sadistic under­
cover agent) to throw balls into 
holes, thus advancing at a quick 
pace the protective group of old 
B-52 bombers which was trying 
to release its payload over Mos­
cow before the attacking Rus­
sian plane could destroy Wash­
ington. If you got your bomb­
er to Moscow first, you won 
any number of worthless prizes 
(no account was taken of the 
fact that Washington would be 
destroyed anyway; this was not 
a sophisticated, missile reac­
tion, but merely a senseless act 
of vengence). At last glance, 
the booth was attracting many 
participants. Its creators were 
those old local supporters of 
the university, the CMU Com­
muters Club.
This booth, more than any 
other, seemed to be the major 
emblem of the fair, a fair de­
voted to recalling the balmy 
decade of 1950, a decade which 
offered the fantasies of Disney 
coupled with the “realities” of 
the Cold War. How well those 
two fantasies co-existed and 
formed part of us all. It is an 
amazing fact that students of 
1971 are still trying to keep our 
minds firmly rooted in the world 
gone by, as if Vietnam, Kent 
and Jackson State and Chicago 
(to name but the highlights) had 
never occurred at all. How un­
thinkable it is that a large and 
important segment of our uni­
versity community could still 
so naively and so inhumanely 
continue to encourage in the 
world of fantasy (where all evil 
acts are continually committed 
over and over again) the slaught­
er of “commies,” as if they were 
some kind of inhuman, cancer­
ous glob. And how sad it is that 
we instructors have communi­
cated so little real humanistic 
learning to our students that they 
can continue to engage in “Ma­
rine” and “CIA” dreams. This 
indeed is a telling emblem of 
the failures of us and of our 
entire civilization. Even if this 
booth were intended in no hos­
tile way, the very fact of its 
being indicates how well the 
propaganda arm of our govern­
ment has formed the minds of 
our students. The final irony is 
that this fantasy is all too, too 
real. And it is the very reality 
of fantasy which so often 
damns us all.
Some may of course inter­
pret this as being an excessively
serious reaction to what was only 
intended as a “fun thing.” To 
those, I can only say that it is 
often those “fun things” which 
can tell us most about our­
selves.
How much more appropriate 
would have been a booth which 
encouraged love, either EROS 
or AGAPE (or a combination 
of both). Let us all in future 
springs “gather round the May 
Pole” and not around old, hate­
ful illusions of power. Let us 
celebrate the joys of the body 
and of the soul, not the diseases 
of the mind.

Dear TARTAN Editor,
This letter is written in re­
sponse to the criticism received 
by the Commuter Booth, “Kill 
a Commie.”
The first and most important 
point to be made is that the 
booth was a' satire. One critic 
mentioned that the booth was 
unrealistic. One could bomb 
Moscow, and Washington would 
escape the holocaust. This un­
realistic approach further illus­
trates the satirical nature of the 
booth. It should be stated that 
Spring Carnival is unrealistic. 
Spring Carnival is meant to be 
a diversion against the reality of 
school life.
Secondly, the theme of Spring 
Carnival was the Era of 1950. 
The Cold War was an aspect of 
this era. Any Carnival just show­
ing Walt Disney would be a 
distorted view of how one want­
ed to see the ’50’s, not how the 
1950’s actually were. Granted, 
this is a small point, but the 
Booth did fulfill and adhere to 
the theme.
Any era has its radicals and 
absurd points of view. One of 
the absurd radicals of the 1950’s 
was McCarthy. The Commuter 
Booth was built to point out Mc- 
Carthyism in all of its stupidity.
The only point that upsets the 
Commuters the most is the 
relating of the Commuters as 
friends of the University. The 
Commuters are the most neglect­
ed and unloved minority of the 
school and the Administration 
hasn’t done too much (nothing 
is a little less than too much), 
and anyone who thinks that Com­
muters support the University 
Administration should have his 
head examined for probable 
brain damage.

Dear Editor:
The most important anti-war 
offensive ever attempted is be­
ing organized for the end of 
April and the first week in May. 
For the first time in American 
history, the anti-war movement 
is attempting to use the force of 
massive, non-violent action to 
confront the power of the war- 
makers. Our plans call for dis­
ruption of governmental opera­
tions *in Washington, D.C. and 
a national moratorium. Unfor­
tunately, the national media has 
blacked out information on this 
»ffensive and distorted the rest. 
Our only hope is that you can 
convey to students on your camp­
us the importance of what we 
have planned.
Many of the people who came 
to Washington for the peace 
march April 24 have remained 
behind to begin an intensive 
People’s Lobby. We are urging 
government workers to join us 
in our actions the first week in 
May, to strike against the gov­
ernment and protest the war. 
This coming weekend. May 1st 
and 2nd, there will be a massive 
assembly in Washington at which 
Ralph Abernathy, Benjamin 
Spock and Cesar Chavez will 
speak, Tim Hardin, Arlo Guth­
rie and Johnny Winter will per­
form, and workshops will be held 
to prepare everyone for partici­
pation in non-violent direct 
action. People should proceed 
directly to Washington Monu­
ment that weekend, permits 
have been secured.
On Monday, May 3, we will 
begin massive, non-violent dis­
ruption of the war-machine 
throughout Washington, focus­
ing on Monday at the Penta­
gon, on Tuesday at the Justice 
Department. On Wednesday, 
May 5, there will be a national 
moratorium on business as usual, 
coupled with student strikes in 
the high schools and colleges 
around the country. In Washing­
ton D.C., we will shut down 
the entire governmental opera­
tion of the city, culminating in 
non-violent civil disobedience at 
the Capitol Building.
President Nixon has made it 
clear that he has no intention of 
ending U.S. involvement in the 
war. On April 16 he told the 
country that Americans would 
remain until the Thieu regime 
was sufficiently stable to be self- 
sufficient, i.e. for the next 
decade at least. And he pro­
mised continued Air Force 
bombings and army operations.
Nixon knows that the majority 
oppose the war, but he thinks 
that this sentiment can be mani­
pulated into controllable chan­
nels in mass marches and elec­
toral activity. We must create 
the conditions under which Nix­
on is forced to end the war. 
We are therefore asking all stu­
dents who recognize the power 
of massive, nonviolent action to 
join us in Washington: come by 
May 2nd and spend three days 
demonstrating the depth of our 
opposition to the continuing 
murder in Southeast Asia. For 
those who cannot come to Wash­
ington, that commitment must 
be directed to organizing for 
the nationwide moratorium and 
work stoppage on May 5th.

To the Campus Community:
On Monday, April 26, I at­
tended a meeting of the Edu­
cational Policy Council so that 
I could write an article for the 
TARTAN to report the events 
at the meeting. In the article, 
which appears elsewhere in 
this issue, I have attempted to 
be as objective in my reporting 
as possible. However, I also 
feel compelled to reveal my 
opinions and observations of 
things that occurred at the 
meeting.
I was appalled by the ter­
rible attendence at what may 
be the most important education­
al group on campus. Approxi­
mately half of the members 
attended the meeting. Despite 
the fact that this is the end of 
the year, EPC members should
feel an obligation to them­
selves, the Council, and the 
entire campus to attend these 
meetings. Also, of the people 
who did attend, only about half 
voiced opinions on what I con­
sider to be very important 
topics.
Dr. Robert Rice, the new head 
of the restructured Department 
of Biological Sciences gave a 
progress report concerning the 
department. The report touched 
upon the crucial areas of depart­
mental goals, teacher qualifica­
tions, course offerings, and de­
gree programs. Thanks primarily 
to Drs. Hayes and Korn of the 
Psychology Department, the 
question was raised concerning 
the validity of hiring of teach­
ers based upon research done. 
Much to my dismay, none of the 
three student representatives 
felt this topic was important 
enough to voice an opinion on 
it, much less make concrete sug­
gestions. Dr. Rice then left 
without any formal requests 
being made of him, so that in 
effect, the Council did nothing.
The Educational Policy Coun­
cil has the resources, power, and 
ability to be an extremely 
worthwhile and influential body 
in giving students the best edu­
cation possible. At the present, 
though, it seems to serve merely 
as a high level review board. 
I believe that the Council 
should examine itself and seek 
ways to make it a dynamic 
force in improving the educa­
tion at CMU.
Sincerely,
Ken Sachs
Thanx
Editor, THE TARTAN,
Towards the end of B.B. 
King’s final set Saturday night, 
I began to think about every­
thing the Activities Board has 
done this year. Through a diver­
sity of programs, the AB has 
endured its biggest year yet, 
spending well over $50,000. 
Since few of those who con­
tributed to the success of these 
programs received due credit, 
I wish to express my thanks to 
every member of the Activities 
Board. In particular I want to 
thank the following with whom 
I have personally worked.
I thank Scott Murray for 
single-handed production of the 
play “Stop the World,” the 
Jacques Loussier Trio concert, 
and the operation of the AB 
sound system; Mike Harbadin 
for the writing of many articles 
and ads in the TARTAN and ^ 
the production of posters; Rick 
Braverman for TARTAN articles, 
ads, and single-handed produc­
tion of “The Second Annual 
Film Festival;” and Leslie 
Ward for never ending depen­
dability.
I thank the chairmen of the 
film, coffeehouse, lecture, and 
TGIF committees, respectively: ^
Steve Singer, Ray Schmitt, 
Donna LaPietra, and Jim Wes­
ton.
I thank the members of the 
concert committee: Bruce Gold­
smith, Gene Scaramuzzo, Mari­
lyn Shenker, Bob Slurzberg,
Jack Kosko, and Tom Lee.
And I especially want to thank 
Mr. McCurdy, Mrs. Rudman,
Mrs. Rosenberg and Ellen Celli 
for their never ending assistance.
Bill Iacono
Director of 
Activities Board
STAG
Dear Editor:
I want to thank the students ^ 
of this University for their 
strong support of STAG Movies. 
Attendance has grown steadily 
and my faith in the sagacity of 
CMU students is undisturbed. 
STAG will live on in the fall, 
though in a slightly different 
form. The student government 
has decided to adopt STAG in­
to its Activities Board Film Com- 
mittee Program where it will 
live, hopefully, forever.
I especially thank George 
Sfirri, who has done almost all 
the publicity for STAG, and 
Steve Harris, who has worked 
diligently at the door. Thanks 
also to David New, the designer 
of two of the posters. Finally, I 
thank Debbie Holdstein, Sherry 
Sukol, and the TARTAN editors ^ 
for their magnificent sup­
port.

"...WITH A BANG..."
by BEVERLY NORETSKY
Student Senate met for the final time this 
semester and doled out several sizeable chunks of 
money to needy organizations.
Geoff F ried asked that Senate reconsider 
the Student Gallery’s request for $2,000, which was 
defeated last week, 3-9-12. He pointed out that this 
was a cut of $700 in operating expenses. The $2,000 
would cover lighting, rennovations, publicity, 
heating, air conditioning and a burglar alarm.
The Gallery plans to increase exhibit space and 
provide longer running group shows. Fried said that 
a move to the GSIA lobby would not be beneficial 
because the Woodlawn Gallery is far more 
sophisticated and is rent-free, so the amount of 
money requested would be the same.
Senators questioned the tuition rebates offered to 
the Gallery’s directors. Fried pointed out that these 
rebates were provided by the Administration and not 
the Student Government, so the budget would still 
not be affected. The question was called and Senate 
approved the $2,000 appropriation 16-8-6.
Sam Frenkil moved that Senate recommend that 
should Placements move out of Skibo, Security move 
into the vacated space. Several objections were 
made to this. Already there is not enough space for 
student activities. A student union is for students. 
The space that might be vacated is “taylor made for
security, but it doesn’t benefit students. The move 
would not cut Security’s response time appreciably. 
The motion was defeated 11-14-1.
A Phi O requested $2,000.for next year’s faculty 
course evaluation. Murray Singer amended the 
proposal to provide $1,000 for one semester, with a 
committee set up to evaluate the FCE. The 
amendment was approved 23-3-4.
Roger Dooley moved that Senate send a letter to 
Student Affairs concerning property destruction. 
The letter would recommend that campus offenders 
be put on probation or expelled and be made to pav 
for their damages. Non-student offenders would be 
turned over to the Pittsburgh Police. The 
recommendation was amended so that students 
would have to pay for whatever property damage 
they caused, but that they would not be punished 
academically. The amended motion was passed 24-2-1.
Senate also approved allocations of $345 to the 
Flim Workshop and $1,216 to the Hockey Club for 
additional equipment.
Finally, it was recommended that $500 be 
apropriated to Freshman Orientation. Debate 
centered around a proposal included in the budget 
which provided $150 to rent two buses for one day as 
an airport shuttle for freshmen. Several Senators 
questioned the need for this service, but the 
appropriation was approved 22-4-5.
ANNOUNCEMENTS
THE HUNT Institute Scholarship 
was first awarded in the Spring 
of 1971 and will be available 
for award on an annual basis 
hereafter. This Scholarship, made 
available by the Hunt Foundation 
is normally awarded in amounts 
of $1,000. The number of awards 
during any academic year will be 
dependent upon the number and 
quality of applications received 
for the Scholarship. Awards are 
made to students whose research 
activities will utilize the collec­
tions of the Hunt Institute for Bo­
tanical Documentation. Normal­
ly these activities would be ex­
pected to be in conjunction with 
the preparation of doctoral dis­
sertations, but this restriction is 
not necessarily limiting on the 
Scholarship.
The collections of the Hunt In­
stitute for Botanical Documenta­
tion (of which the Hunt Botanical 
Library is a part) include not only 
books on the history of botany, 
but also many works relating to 
the general area of the history 
of science and natural history. The 
Library's collections are strongest 
in works published from the year 
1730 to 1840, although many 
separate areas of the collection 
are strong in other specialties or 
other periods. Notable areas of 
such strength are the many ex­
amples of early herbals and a 
correction of works relating to the 
Swedish naturalist, Carl Lin­
naeus, which include not only 
botany but general natural his­
tory, zoology, and medicine. 
Other reference resources of the 
institute include a large file of 
biographical data relating to 
workers in the botanical field as 
well as a large collection of por­
traits of such persons. In addition 
to these more specifically botan­
ical parts of the collection, there 
is also a collection of approxi­
mately 16,000 original works of 
botanical art. Many of these rep­
resent not only the original work 
(i.e., painting or drawing), but 
also artist's proofs, color proofs, 
and the final published work in 
which the works were used as il­
lustrations. Many of these suites 
of drawings and paintings are 
modern, but a number of them 
are also quite old. One of the ear­
liest in the collection is a series 
ofwood blocks used to illustrate 
an early herbal of 1 563.
Students whose areas of dis­
sertation study might potentially 
utilize the facilities and collec­
tions of the Hunt Institute for Bo­
tanical Documentation are en­
couraged to consult with the di-
rector and other members of the 
staff prior to submission of a 
Scholarship application. Appli­
cations will normally be consider­
ed in the Spring for the Fall of 
the following year, but students 
are encouraged to discuss poten­
tial projects at any time. For the 
Fall of 1971 applications may 
be submitted at any time until 
October 1, 1971.
THE SECRET to a better tomorrow 
might be you and the American 
Red Cross today. Red Cross would 
like the help of college volunteers 
. . . because Pittsburgh needs the 
help of college volunteers! If you 
are tired of standing around, talk­
ing about the world's problems, 
and recognize that things are only 
getting worse ... if you are ready 
to try to attack these problems, 
contact Red Cross now at 471- 
4923.
Posifions requiring college age 
volunteers are now available in 
tutoring, vocational training and 
recreation, as well as many other 
fields. You can also help in hos­
pitals, day care centers and con­
valescent homes.
If you are interested in giving 
at least one day a week to help 
right a wrong, call the Red Cross. 
Make your life more than some­
thing you do while waiting for 
death!
FACULTY and staff who will at­
tend Commencement on Monday, 
May 17, are requrested to park 
in their regularly assigned areas, 
except in the case of the Skibo 
reserved lot. That lot will be re­
served for honorary degree can­
didates, trustees and other guests. 
Those who regularly park there 
are urged to use the lot adjoining 
Morewood Gardens.
THE FINAL dorm movie, Barbarel- 
la,” will have four showings Sat­
urday, May 1, 4, 6:30, 8:30, and 
10:30 p.m.
WE WOULD like to congratulate 
David Caney, Jeff Conrad and Ro­
bin Grossman for flunking their 
draft physicals. Our sincerest 
best wishes to you all. May your 
future be bright.

AN EXHIBIT of drawings, prints, 
and paintings by seniors Hester 
Simpson, Celia Reisman, and 
Mary Ann Leff-Rofey will be 
shown in the GSIA building. The
show will be held from May 3 to

AAUW NEEDS YOU 
The American Association of 
University Women (AAUW) is 
a national organization of 170,- 
000 women college graduates. 
We're concerned with the issues 
that concern you—the environ­
ment, our cities, racism, educa­
tion, the status of women, our na­
tional priorities. Membership in a 
local branch after your gradua­
tion will give you the opportun­
ity to meet other women with 
these concerns and to become in­
volved through study and action 
in the important issues facing 
your community and nation. For 
information on the branches in 
the Pittsburgh area, call Mrs. Ed­
ward J. Bishop, 486-1138. Infor­
mation on branches in other areas 
may be obtained by writing to 
the AAUW Educational Center,

ington, D. C. 20037.
THE Scholarship Committee of 
AWS met with Dean Milligan and 
Miss Campbell on Thursday, April 
22, and the following girls have 
been awarded $100 scholar­
ships for'71-72:
Alexandra Cummings, Marjorie 
Ertle, Mary Irwin, Geraldine Kloss, 
Agatha Marshall and Patricia Mc- 
Evoy.
Congratulations! The criteria for 
selection was AWS participation, 
activities, need, and scholarship. 
Due to the large number of appli­
cants, those who received the 
AWS scholarship previously were 
not considered. (Thirty-seven girls 
applied.)

"...WITH A WHIMPER"
by DEBBIE HOLDSTEIN
A specially-called meeting of 
the Faculty Senate focused on the 
approval of the amended 
document on Standards and 
Procedures for Faculty Review. 
Professor Dan Resnick, chairman 
of the Committee to Develop 
Procedures for Faculty Review, 
presented the document for Senate 
consideration to “see whether the 
changes reflect the intent of the 
Senate” for the redraft. Both 
editorial and substantive changes 
were reviewed at the meeting, 
with several form changes 
suggested and approved. The 
document was finally approved 
without dissent and will be 
submitted by Senate Chairman 
Akram Midani to President 
Stever. The report’s final destin­
ation will be its permanent 
inclusion in the Faculty Handbook.
Also placed on the agenda was 
a report by the Committee 
assigned to study the progress of 
C-MAP. The report was referred
to the Educational Policy Council 
for discussion, action and recom­
mendation to the Faculty Senate. 
The general outline of the Ad Hoc 
Committee’s final summary in­
cluded the Nature and Goals of C- 
MAP, the Operation of C-MAP, 
Performance of Students, 
Program Difficulties, and 
Conclusions. Stressed was the con­
tinuing assessment of the 
program’s success and the
participation in the development 
and interpretation of policy by the 
Educational Policy Council. The 
report as a whole served as a 
reaffirmation of the Committee of 
the Faculty Senate’s Commitment 
to the Continuation of C-MAP as 
“a positive and essential
contribution to the equalization of 
opportunities within a larger
society.”

5. The Trustees authorized the conferring of degrees 
on all duly certified undergraduates and graduate stu­
dents and of honorary degrees at Commencement on May 
17,1971.
6. Appointments and promotions planned by the pres­
ident were approved. The complete list of promotions ap­

ture, and Louis F. Gilberti, Architecture.
7. The Budget for 1971-72 as recommended by the 
Administration and the Budget Committee was approv­
ed. President Stever is issuing soon a document on this 
subject for the information of the campus community.
8. A progress report on the Fund for Distinction was 
presented. The total of gifts and subscriptions to this 
campaign as of March 30 amounted to $33.1 million and 
over $9 million in proposals have been submitted to other 
donor prospects. Plans are under consideration by the 
Development and Planning Committee of the Trustees to 
revise the goals for the individual projects in the cam­
paign set up three years ago in the light of experience 
since then, especially the need for additional funds to sup­
port annual operations.
9. The Buildings and Grounds Committee reported 
that the construction of Science Hall is on schedule, with 
occupancy scheduled to begin in mid-May. The architect 
is developing preliminary drawings and specifications 
for the first phase of the planned Dramatic Arts Center; 
construction could begin in the fall of 1971 if funding can 
be completed. The administration is examining the cost 
estimate for the architect’s preliminary plans for an 
addition to Skibo and assessing the available financing. 
The design and installation of fire alarm systems and the 
installation of sprinkler systems are going forward. 
The Trustees authorized the Administration to negotiate 
for the sale of the Spear-Klee properties on Northumber­
land St. upon the most favorable terms for the University.
10. The Educational Affairs Committee discussed 
the effects the budget reduction might have on the aca­
demic program. The faculty for 1971-72 has been reduced 
by 22 positions from the number this yea^, and the reg­
ular faculty will increase it teaching of evening classes 
a large number of which have been taught by part-time 
faculty hired for this purpose. The reduction in faculty 
may have some effect on the number of course offerings 
and on teaching loads. There was a long discussion of the 
difficulties with the tenure system during a time of bud­
get contraction, of its impact on younger faculty, and of 
the restudy of the tenure concept being made by some uni­
versities and organizations. Changing patterns in college 
attendance from the common four-year sequence were 
discussed, and also the problem for graduate enrollment 
posed by the fall-off in job opportunities and fellowship 
support.
11. The report of the Finance Committee comment­
ed on data about the University investments. The market 
value on March 31, was $112 million, a net gain of $17 
million over the market value on July 1, 1970. This was in 
large part due to a partial recovery from the decline in 
common stock values that had occurred since 1968. There 
was a careful analysis of the recent trend for people and 
organizations to involve themselves in presenting to 
corporation shareholders’ meetings proposals designed to 
serve certain social ends. Two current examples are the 
shareholder proposals being presented to Gulf Oil and 
General Motors. The proposals to Gulf Oil are being sup­
ported by the Southern Africa Task Force of the Presby­
terian Church, U.S.A., which seek to exclude Gulf’s oper­
ations in colonial-ruled areas. The University holds equity 
investments in over 100 companies. The established po­
licy of the University is that proxiesfor Carnegie-Mellon 
University held securities are given to management to 
vote in stockholders’ meetings; that if the Trustees con­
clude that it it is not in the best interests of the Universi­
ty to do so in any particular case, the Finance Committee 
will consider taking such action as seems appropriate in­
cluding disposition of the' investment. After discussing 
the Gulf proxy statement and the two letters that had 
been sent to the University in support of it, the Finance 
Committee decided that the established policy should be 
applied. The report of the Finance Committee was approv­
ed by the Board without dissenting vote.
12. The Student Affairs Committee which included 
five students had met earlier in the day. In the discussion 
of additional student housing it was noted that the original 
target date of 1972 is not feasible and that needs must be 
redefined in the light of changing patterns of student life. 
The university management group plans to review this 
subject during the summer in order to plot a reasonable 
course of action. An excellent report was given about 
the Student Housing course that was presented this year 
with 17 students enrolled. On student participation in 
Trustee Committees, Dean Swank was asked to request 
reports from the chairmen and the student members of 
the committees on Buildings and Grounds, Development 
and Planning, Educational Affairs, and Student Affairs 
to obtain views on the value of student participation. 
The Student Affairs Committee urged that the chairmen 
of these committees publish agendas in advance of 
meetings for the information of student representa­
tives and other students who might wish them to bring 
up matters for discussion. It also asked that the chairmen 
of the other Trustee committees consider having student 
participation. It recommended that the president initiate 
a study of those private universities that have student 
members on their Boards or that have open Trustee meet­
ings, for the information of the Student Affairs Commit­
tee, and this recommendation was approved by the Board.
13. The chairman of the Faculty Senate reported that ^ 
the Senate’s proposed policy for faculty review in proce­
dures involving alleged gross misconduct and termina­
tion of service was nearing completion and would be pre­
sented for Senate action next week. When finally approv­
ed it will be included in the Faculty Handbook. He 
thanked the Board for the opportunities to attend Board 
meetings during his tenure and spoke favorably of the 
positive relations between the faculty organization and 
the administration.
i14. The president of Student Government reported 
that in February the Student Government Corporation 
was formed. Its purposes are possible operation of stu­
dent-run housing, improved health insurance, and an or­
ganization to be responsible for student publications and 
thus to save the University from possible embarrass­
ment. As yet the Corporation has not been in a position to 
take action because a committee is studying what the 
relationship should be between the University and the 
CORPORATION. The Student Senate is conducting a survey
of students as a basis for guidelines for making future i 
budget allocations for student activities.
At President Stever’s request, Dr. Kibbee reported 
on the meetings of the committee that is exploring the 
Corporation and the relationship of the University to it. 
Several problems have been identified, including the 
representation of the Board of Trustees and the Mayor 
of Pittsburgh on the Board of Directors of the Corpora­
tion, the fact that the Directors have no means of ac­
complishing its stated purposes, and thé question of how 
its operating funds should be provided. The committee 
will continue to seek solutions to these knotty problems.
15. At this point in the meeting Aiken W. Fisher, 
completing his five-year term as chairman of the 
Board, turned the chair over to Fred C. Foy. The presi­
dent presented a resolution of appreciation to Mr. Fish­
er for his service; it was adopted by applause and a stand­
ing vote.
16. The chairman announced his appointments of I
standing committees for 1971-72. The Mellon Institute 
Committee has been discontinued, and the Research 
and Government Relations Committee suspended. Chair­
men of the committees are as follows: Budget, Mr. 
Fisher; Buildings and Grounds, Mr. Pease; Develop­
ment and Planning, Mr. Johnston; Educational Affairs,
Mr. Charpie; Finance, Mr. Walton; Nominating, Mr. 
Mayer; Student Affairs, Mr. Depp.
17. The chairman called attention to the list of gifts I
and grants for March totaling $395,000 and to the total 
for the fiscal year to date of $4.3 million.
18. The president invited the Trustees to Mellon In­
stitute on April 23 for the award to Dr. Harrison Brown 
and his Robert Kennedy Duncan Memorial Lecture and 
to Commencement on May 17. He commented on the 
campus reaction to the budget cuts. The faculty seems to 
understand the problem and to be cooperative in our f 
plans to cope with it. Some of our unionized employees 
and a small group of students were concerned about re­
cent layoffs of service employees, and a petition was 
circulated among students requesting a halt in any more 
layoffs until the budget was studied to try to find some 
way to avoid layoffs. A few students picketed Warner 
Hall. Our response, carefully prepared without conced­
ing on principle, seemed to close the issue. The Commis. 
sion on the Status and Needs of Women at Carnegie- 
Mellon University has been gathering information to 
discover whether discrimination exists against women i 
in hiring, salaries, promotions, etc. It plans to present 
a preliminary report this month and a final report next 
October. Our work in this connection will be helpful in 
assuring our compliance with new regulations of Fed­
eral agencies. The SPIRIT organization made up of black 
students on campus wrote requesting a meeting with 
the Finance Committee to support the proposals in the 
Gulf Oil proxy statement. It was discussed by the Fi­
nance Committee, which plans to arrange such a meet­
ing with some of its members. SPIRIT conducted four 
days of meetings on the campus to discuss problems re- 
lating to black peoples in Southern Africa, and they 
were well managed. We are pleased at the responsible 
way this group is conducting its activities and are glad to 
work with them.

A day in the life of a tourguide 
must be great. I’m a tourguide for 
the Admissions Office for about 
two hours a week. And let me tell 
you, it’s one hell of a two hours.
I walk into the Admissions Of-
farmmmmems. Nine times out of 
ten he is accompanied by Mrs. 
Wohlfarth. I greet them formally.
“Hi, my name’s Joel, I’ll be 
showing you around campus.”
Mr. Wohlfarth gives me a den­
ture laden smile and extends his 
mammoth hand. I reach out and
fice to meet my advisary. He’s 
usually a CIT nurd, wearing a 
sporty double breasted sport­
coat that went out of style two 
years ago. He’s also wearing an 
electric blue shirt, a shiny ma­
roon tie, brown buckle round tow 
shoes and gray wool pants. His
hair is short and greasy, side­
burns long and face red with acne. 
He’s also wearing large black 
rimmed glasses. If it’s 100 de­
grees out or 30 degrees out, he’ll 
be dressed the same. And goddamn 
if they don’t all look alike.
His name is Craig Wohlfarth or

It’s Hard...Being a Leadersomething like that. I always re­
member the first name, the last 
name inevitably slurs into Wohl-
in no time at all my hand is crush­
ed. Holding my limp hand, we 
head out toward Skibo. I show 
them where the fraternity houses 
are and tell them if he’s lucky, 
he’ll get to eat with the girls in 
the basement of Morewood Gar­
dens. And if he’s really lucky, he’ll 
get to stay in E tower right next 
to A, B, C and D. The parents like 
that idea. They can’t wait to see 
bring home his first girl. Into Ski­
bo we go.
“Here’s WRCT and over there 
is the TARTAN office and—Hey, 
Mr. Wohlfarmmmems (slur) 
where ya goin?”
And on that note, he walks into 
a closet and trips over a pail into 
some mops.
“Are you alright Mr. Wohlfar- 
mmmmems?”
“Sure, sure, I’m OK, I just 
thought I’d see what was in there.”
“Oh George, the young man, 
show us everything.”
Craig stands there in embar­
rassment.
We walk through Skibo and head 
toward Maggie Murph, the gym 
and Fine Arts building. They’re 
not asking any questions, so 
they’re not making it easy.
“If you have any questions feel 
free to ask, I can’s cover every­
thing.
“Yeah, when are we going to
see where Craig will be at?”
“Well, he’ll be spending his 
time in different places, the class­
es are not situated in one particu­
lar area.”
“Yeah, but where is Craig’s de­
partment?”
“Well he’ll probably be spend­
ing most of his class hours over in 
Baker Hall.”
“Oh yeah.”
“Yeah.”
I take them over near the stadi­
um and tell them intramural 
sports are just as important as 
the intercollegiate sports. I tell 
them that the students go to see 
the band as much as they go to see 
the football team. I say that to a 
hundred Craigs and get the same 
hundred laughs, and it’s not even 
funny. We walk past GSIA and 
through Fine Arts. Some girls 
walk by and they’re braless. Criag 
takes notice. Mr. Wohlfarth tries 
his damned best not to notice, but 
he doesn’t succeed. Meanwhile, 
Mrs. Wohlfarth pretends to be 
impressed with the sholdy con­
dition of the building.
Finally I take them to Baker 
Hall. They see that it slopes 
downward.
“Hey, this must be great for a 
skateboard, yuk, yuk.”
“As a matter of fact, it prob­
ably is.”
“So this is where he will be hav­
ing most of his classes.”
“Yep, this is the place.” Mrs. 
Wohlfarth looks around and is of 
course very impressed.
“Oh how nice, isn’t it Craig?’’ 
AH Craig wants to do now is take 
his parents home He’s obviouslv 
has had it.
We head down the homestretch 
We walk out of Baker and go to 
wards Doherty. I show them thi 
new computer building which has 
recently been named Scienfe Hall. 
I tell Craig that he migm ^ave 
some classes in there because 
he’s in CIT.
“Oh, isn’t that nice CRAIG?” 
Craig is thrilled.
We’re finally standing outside 
of Warner Hall.
“I hope that you enjoyed your 
tour.”
“We enjoyed it very much, thank 
you ”
“I hope I see >ou here nevt year 
Craig.” Craig mutters his firs*
I words. “Yeah.“

DECEPTIVE LINES, JERRY RIOPELLE,
HEADS HANDS & FEET by Michael John Harbadin
L.A. WOMAN by Collins
JOHN MAY ALL by Walter Koehler
Three from
Capitol
Well, since this is the last 
TARTAN of the year, I thought 
I’d clue you in on some nice 
new albums to buy for your 
girlfriend (or whatever) when 
you go back home to East 
Peoria:
Deceptive Lines/Plum Nelly
The attempt at profoundly 
poetic liner notes says, “Strong 
armed missionaries with Thor- 
like visions of resounding plu­
mage. . I’m not about to make 
an attempt to decipher that in 
any way, but I’ll give you -my 
impressions, for what they’re 
worth. This album contains six 
cuts (three to a side), five writ­
ten by the group’s lead guitar­
ist, John E. Walker, and one by 
their drummer, Christopher 
Lloyd. As is the tendency 
with groups getting into what 
could be loosely defined as a 
jazz-rock idiom, Plum Nelly 
becomes involved in long cuts, 
the average being seven min­
utes. As a result, the songs lack 
a singular melodic strength, 
tending to rely more on themes 
and total structure than a re­
tainable melody. (Which means 
you can’t hum it back after you 
hear it the first or second time.) 
The exception is one three-min­
ute cut, Never Done. The group 
uses the usual keyboards, gui­
tars, and drums, and adds a little 
conga percussion, flute and alto 
piccolo for flavoring. The wood­
winds are deftly handled by 
Jeremy Steig, whose album 
Energy, was reviewed here a 
few weeks back. Steig is into 
the same type of thing, his 
music relying upon a total ef­
fect, a mood, to leave the listen­
er with a feeling for the mu­
sic. In Steigs’ music, improvisa­
tion is a necessary component 
for conveying the feeling and 
completing the mood. Plum 
Nelly uses this technique to a 
somewhat lesser extent than 
does Steig. They do not really 
improvise, but play with a free­
dom that suggests it. The effect 
is a sound that is unrestrained 
in its structure. Distinct themes 
are evident in some pieces, and 
yet at times the thematic qual­
ity is lost altogether, and the mu­
sic rambles. In all, the album 
is quite good instrumentallv, 
but the vocals are weak in 
places. Plum Nelly is a group 
of musicians who don’t seem 
to be satisfied with present 
forms of music; they seem to 
be searching for a focus for 
their own ideas and concepts 
of what they would like their 
music to be and become. This 
explorative quality is welcome 
in any art, for it wards off the 
possibility of creative and 
asthetic stagnation. The need 
for discovery is evident in the 
artist, and should be evident in 
the listener 'viewer as well.
Jerry Riopelle/ Jerry Riopelle
“Some of the pieces are per­
sonal and some are just char­
acters I like and play, but 
they’re all love songs for me.”
So much for what Jerry Rio- 
pelle is trying to do with his 
music. So many people try to 
get an artist to verbally reveal 
what he is all about, not re­
alizing that his work should do 
just that. The simple fact that 
an artist writes, paints, or com­
poses should tell anyone inter­
ested that he feels a need to 
express what he feels inside. 
Not for a long time have I 
heart someone expres himself 
so fully through his music as 
Jerry Riopelle does. His 
songs are so very real. You can’t 
just listen without feeling. 
Jerry reaches out at a gut level, 
evoking an essential response 
from within. He grabs at your 
humanness, and you respond. 
It’s so easy to feel with him, 
he speaks to you like an old 
friend:
We can go the distance, Mama 
If you got the time 
We can go the distance, Mama 
Just give me the sign
Everybody need a lover 
Everybody need a lover who 
Help you right thru the night 
Right thru the night 
(We can go the Distance)
Jerry reaches out to common 
human foibles through his own 
life, giving you an insight into 
your own life, as well as his. 
His expression of isolation is 
poetically human:
Oh—the good times were the 
best times 
Ain’t no lie y’all
Ginger Ale—Jack Daniels—Here’s 
to you
Like a motel sign that shines 
because it’s 
Lonely—I just—
Sit so vacant—don’t know what 
to do
(Oklahoma Double Shuffle)
He is not without humor, either, 
as we experience those troubl­
ed times with a weary smile:
The mailman has my boots 
You got my Cadillac 
My brother got my suits 
Why won’t you take me back
(Elaine)
The good times show through, 
too, and you know he’s been 
there and back, but you sense 
he’s had a few more bad times 
than good:
I got ol‘ St. Christopher 
Just a riding on my dash 
If I should loose my nerve 
He gonna save my ass
(poo Proff Hi-way Romance)
At a time when solo singer/ 
songwriter musicians are experi­
encing new success because of 
renewed public interest, Jerry 
Riopelle should not, and will 
not, be glossed over as “just 
another Leon Russel/Elton John 
type.” (He plays piano.) His 
honesty will shine through to 
people filled up to their com­
puter dating forms with pre­
packaged emotionalism, in 
search of something a little 
more real. As I listened to Jerry, 
I thought back to the B. B. 
King concert of last week. 
When you listen to The King, 
you don’t just hear him play 
music, you experience part of 
his life. The same with Jerrv—
each song exposes a little more 
of his soul, a little more of 
himself.
The album is well produced; 
musically, it is arranged, and 
Jerry is accompanied, only 
when necessary, leaving the 
man and his music to stand on 
their own, nothing clouding 
what he has to say. His words 
are a bit indistinguishable at 
times, but the lyrics are enclos­
ed, thoughtfully. Half the feel­
ing is in the voice, though, as 
it quivers and wails and moans, 
giving the words a reality be­
yond their own. Jerry Riopelle is 
a poet, and he’ll teach you as 
mucy about your own life, as 
he does about his own. Just 
listen, and he’ll touch you.
Heads Hand and Feet
Heads Hands & Feet
Ever notice how groups are 
beginning to title their album 
after themselves? It simplifies 
things somewhat, but makes for 
some silly looking titles. This 
band is composed of six of 
Britain’s master studio/performing 
musicians: Lead singer Tony
Colton (who produced the al­
bum, as well as albums for 
Atomic Rooster, Shirley Bassey 
and Richard Harris); the legen­
dary guitarist, Albert Lee; Com­
poser/Guitarist Ray Smith (Lord 
Sutch, Manfred Mann, has also 
written for Cream, Chad and 
Jeremy, the Easybeats); Drummer 
Pete Gavin, (Bluesology, Paper 
Dolls, Long John Baldry); Bas­
sist Charles Hodge, (Jerry Lee 
Lewis, Gene Vincent, Rebel 
Rousers); and Pianist/Organist 
Mike O’Neill, (Georgie Fame, 
Dusty Springfield, Donovan). 
If you are unfamiliar with the 
early' English bands mentioned 
above, they were the best in the 
early days of British Rock evolu­
tion. This is Head Hands & 
Feets’ debut album, a double­
record set containing seventeen 
tracks running the gamut from 
C&W to Hard Rock and ballads. 
Other groups have tried the 
same, but have found their ener­
gies and talents expended long 
before the albums’ completion. 
Hands & Feet prove their in­
ventiveness, creativity, and en­
ergy on this effort, a vivid, pow­
erful work. It is a culmination 
of all their talents into a well- 
rounded, beautifully formed 
offering. Tony Colton, leader 
and producer, exerts his talents 
especially on the well-done bal­
lads, “Look at the World it’s 
Changing,” “Song for Suzie,” 
“I Wish You Knew Me,” and 
“Little Bit Lonely.” “Look at the 
World” is the most beautiful, 
immediately engaging. “Green 
Liquor” and “Country Boy” 
exhibits the flashy, flying fin­
gers of Albert Lee, and “Every­
body’s Hustlin’,” and “Hang 
Me, Dang Me” show the bands’ 
understanding and love of coun­
try humor and style. The entire 
album is well-conceived, plan­
ned, and executed. Be the first 
one on your block to have Head 
Hands & Feet in your collection. 
The album is simply one of the 
best group eftorts to come out 
this year. It's quite a Feet; for 
good Heads into music, it beats 
everything else Hands down.

London
The Doors are not forgotten.
Their last product, “L.A. 
Woman,” can’t help but bring 
to mind memories of all the 
Doors’ past efforts, especially 
their earlier albums. “L. A. 
Woman” contains parts of “The 
Doors, Strange Days,” and 
“Waiting for the Sun,” and mix­
es them up, and spews them out 
into a sound typical and untypi­
cal of the Doors.
Beside the single “Love Her 
Madly,” the album features 
four other outstanding Morrison 
compositions: the title song, “Been 
Down So Long,” “Riders on the 
Storm,” and “Cars Hiss by my 
Window.” The others are passe, 
being pure Doors slog, some­
thing thrown together out of un­
imaginative chords. “L’America” 
is this album’s “Spanish Cara­
van” (from “Waiting For The 
Sun”). “Crawling King Snake” 
and “The WASP” are feeble at­
tempts by the group to do some­
thing they have no business in: 
early 60’s rock.
Going through the best, how­
ever. ..
“Been Down So Long” is the 
most amazing piece the Doors 
have put on an album, being 
so irregular in relation to their 
style. It begins with the stiff 
beat of a black country blues 
song, working in Robbie Krie- 
ger’s lead, and smoothing out 
into an acceptable prison la­
ment.
Jerry Scheff provides the good 
bass for “Riders on the Storm,” 
Morrison’s poem for this album. 
The sound effects of the rain­
storm are impressive, the thund­
er flows in exactly the right 
places. The vocal fits the song 
well, something rarely true for 
Morrison’s productions. This is 
the sound which, if the Doors 
stuck to it, could revitalize their 
group from a semi-forgotten 
state to a respected position in 
rock and in record racks of disc 
people.
I would advise, if you are not 
a Doors freak, that you listen to 
“L. A. Woman” first before 
buying. You might like it.

One from

John Mayall, nearing his 40th 
birthday, has never had a hit 
single. Only recently has his 
name become known in Ameri­
ca. Yet he is one of the most 
respected figures in rock music, 
certainly stands at the head of 
a long line of British bluesmen, 
and is probably the best white 
harmonica plzyer that ever 
lived.
From 1964 to 1968 he had, 
in England, a band, the Blues- 
breakers, that had as members 
at one time or another nearly 
all the British rock figures— 
Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Mick 
Taylor, Keef Hartley, Aynsley 
Dunbar, Jack Bruce, and John 
McVie, to name a few. Since 
the Bluesbreakers breakup, he 
has organized two notable groups 
under his name—the acoustic 
band that recorded “Empty 
Rooms” and “Turning Point/’ 
and the “USA Union” band, 
still together, of Harvy Uan- 
del, Larry Taylor, and Sugar­
cane Harris. Few people in 
show business have been associ­
ated with so many fine musicians.
Now, with his latest album, 
John Mayall has put all of his 
old comrades togehter in what 
must be the ultimate session 
album. Assembled on this 
double-album set are Eric Clap- 
man, Mick Taylor, and Harvey 
Mandel on guitars, Larry Tay­
lor and Steve Thompson (from 
the “Empty Rooms” band) on 
bass, Johnny Almond on flute 
and saxophones, Keef Hartley
and Paul Lagos drumming, 
Sugarcane Harris playing violin, 
combined with Mayall’s own 
considerable talents on harmoni­
ca, piano, and vocals.
Probably the weakest point 
about the album is the fact that 
all the songs are recent Mayall 
compositions. The lyrics «are 
frankly really awful, mostly 
topical or protest songs about 
everything from groupies to 
highway traffic to late-night
television. Also, it would be
good to have such an impres­
sive group or musicians jam 
on a more traditional, classic 
blues like “You Shook Me,” or 
something along that line.
But the music itself, the actu­
al playing and singing, is no­
thing short of brilliant. On cuts 
like “Force of Nature,” where 
Clapton, Taylor, and Mandel 
join-forces on guitars, the ef­
fect is breathtaking. Sugarcane 
Harris is the most consistently 
able performer. His work with 
Mayall is only another step in 
a series or accomplishments that 
have established him as one of 
the great innovators in rock.
There are some weaker tracks, 
among them “Devil’s Tricks” 
and “Unanswered Questions,” 
but where the artists involved 
let loose, like on “Travelling,” 
a trio of Eric Clapton, Larry 
Taylor, and John Mayall, the 
result is some of the best mu­
sic on record today.

“Waterloo” a struggle to viewS.T.A.G. Series Heads Weekend
BY TERENCE N. PALSO
Napoleon lost at Waterloo and 
so did Sergi Bondarchuk. Sergi 
Bondarchuk? No, history fans, 
he wasn’t a Russian cavalry of­
ficer with a rakish dueling scar 
on his left cheek; he is the Rus­
sian director who, one hundred 
and fifty-four years after the 
event, brought the battle to the 
big screen in one of those epic 
historical pictures which are dy­
ing out because no major studio 
is willing to risk eleven mil- 
lion-plus-dollars on one vehicle 
which may bankrupt the entire 
studio if it loses at the box of­
fice. The only ones with that 
kind of money to throw around 
these days are governments, and 
that is exactly why that crafty 
Italian Dino De Laurentiis en­
tered into a co-production ar­
rangement with state-supported- 
and-controlled Mosfilm.
Bondarchuk has experience 
in this field having been the 
brains behind the mammoth 
Russian vefsion of WAR AND 
PEACE, which, after all did win 
an Academy Award for being 
the best foreign film, so he is the 
logical choice to control the op­
eration. Control is exactly what 
he does, with the result being 
that his epic battle scenes be­
come about as dramatic as a col­
lege textbook’s account of the ac­
tion. Of course, it is true that 
in a college textbook one would 
at least know what was happen­
ing, who was winning, and 
why. Bondarchuk’s cinematic 
eye easily captures the vastness 
of the event, but in doing so he 
appears to have lost sight of the 
details which give an event such 
as this and depth required to 
make it appear to be more 
than just a gigantic military op­
eration resulting in gore and 
carnage.
In this film the battle at Wa­
terloo is viewed through the eyes 
of the two opposing command­
ers: Napoleon, the Duke of 
Wellington. Through the use of 
voice-overs the audience is sup­
posedly informed what is pass­
ing through the minds of these 
two opponents, but this tech­
nique is so poorly handled that 
one begins to wonder if the men 
in charge have any specific plan 
of action. Naturally they must 
have one, but the audience is 
never informed what it is. The 
audience isn’t even given an un­
derstanding of the terrain of the 
battlefield, and therefore its 
appreciation of what it is being 
shown is, at best, only minimal. 
Soldiers charge, men are killed,
and the tide is turned, but the 
audience really does not learn 
how or why something happens. 
Bondarchuk seems to be more 
concerned with presentihg the 
magnitude of the battle than with 
enabling his audience to gain 
an understanding of the event.
The events leading up to the 
battle are also clumsily handled. 
There is no sense of urgency 
surrounding the preparations. The 
events which precipated the 
battle are handled so matter-of- 
factly that they almost give the 
impression that this famous meet­
ing was a matter of chance rath­
er than careful planning. Grant­
ed, Wellington does state that 
he selected the terrain previous­
ly, but the audience never 
learns why he felt Waterloo to 
be so advantageous.
Christopher Plummer por­
trays Wellington as being a very 
proper English gentleman, a 
model of coolness and reserve. 
Plummer’s efforts would have 
undoubtedly met a better fate 
had the audience been made 
more familiar with his charac­
ter. Had the screenplay delved 
more into Wellington’s person­
ality and motivation, then per­
haps he would have come ac­
ross as something more than a 
stiff, two-dimensional prig who 
tries to be profound while ut­
tering “War is a ghastly busi­
ness” cliches.
Rod Steiger plays Napoleon, 
and the script as well as Bon­
darchuk are on his side. While 
trying to depict Napoleon in a 
favorable light, the screenplay, 
however, does him a disservice. 
The script allows glimpses of the 
charisma surrounding Napoleon 
which made his soldiers idolize 
him, but it gives little indication 
of why the common people sup­
ported him. Most scholars would 
agree that the littld emperor was 
a military genius, but WATER­
LOO reveals too little of this. 
Napoleon gives orders, but from 
what the audience sees, they 
are far from brilliant.
Steiger’s portrayal brings Na­
poleon to life. While easily giv­
ing the best performance in the 
film, Steiger nevertheless at 
times comes very close to ruin­
ing what he is trying to create. 
Far too often he resorts to over­
acting to convey his feelings and 
emotions to his audience. Per­
haps he was overwhelmed by the 
part, or maybe Stiger was sim­
ply endeavoring to make up for 
deficiencies in the screenplay, 
but whatever the case his per­
formance while being very good
is far too uneven for an actor 
who has done such excellent 
work in the past.
The original version of WAT­
ERLOO which is being shown 
in the Soviet Union runs for 
approximately five hours. The 
print of the film released in 
the West runs for only approxi­
mately one hundred and twen­
ty-nine minutes, so over half 
of the original footage has been 
edited out. It is therefore very 
likely that a great many of the 
film’s flaws are the result of 
poor editing. Even if this should 
be the case, one would still be 
left to wonder how much Bon­
darchuk’s approach to his sub­
ject detracted from the finish­
ed work. For detached, factual 
accounts may be fine for the 
history texts, but in an epic mo­
tion picture they tend to have a 
sophorific effect on the audi- 
ience.

if nothing ellis
by LARRY ACKERMAN
I heard him first at Tanglewood (Lenox, Massachusetts) at the 
summer festival in 1968 and from the first downbeat, knew damn 
well that this man and his accompanying personnel was more than 
just a jazz band with a groovy beat—Don Ellis is a jazz experience; 
new, vital, unpreductable and absolutely frenetic! His “thing” is, 
to be mild about it, the unusual. Don and his music reflect, precise­
ly, the “new rhythm,” or more specifically, any and everything that 
is not traditional in the field of jazz time structure. He is just at 
home with 3 3/4/8 as Count Basie is with 4/4, and can improvise 
around it with the same ease and excitement that is heard in tfee mu­
sic of the great blues and traditional jazz arrangements, more com­
mon to our ears. The Don Ellis Big Band does not stop with far- 
out time structures and changes (like patterns of 3/4, 4/4, 3/4, 5/4 in 
one section of one piece) but electrifies, literally as well as fig­
uratively, much of his band. For instancd, electric trumpets, saxa- 
phones and trombones — and on top of all this—uses a wild, shim­
mering echo chamber that can all but destroy one’s sanity! The man 
himself is a bundle of electricity and emotion and his fervor vi­
brates through to his fantastic personel who include such well- 
known musicians as Lee Pastora, Glenn Ferris and John Rosenberg.
When you first sit down and begin to listen you'll be com­
pletely confounded by the time structure of the music—but give 
yourself a moment—I’ll guarantee that soon you’ll find yourself 
doing the syncopated clapping in 7/4 during a trumpet solo, and if 
you’re not screaming too loud—you might even hear it when the 
band decides to rejoin its leader!

The King Deserves His Title
by WALTER KOEHLER
Spring Carnival, whatever it’s 
worth, was brought to a thrilling 
climax Saturday night with the 
Carnegie Hall appearance of one 
of today’s superstars who is truly 
deserving of the title, B. B. King. 
Backed very competently by Son­
ny Freeman and his Unusuals, B. 
B. King laid down the most emo­
tion-packed music I’ve ever heard 
on a stage. When I went to the 
concert, I was frankly worried 
that perhaps B. B.’s rise to star­
dom had quieted his vibrant style, 
that perhaps his vast white audi­
ence had taken away the black 
blues in his soul, that perhaps his 
playing had lost the feel of the 
days when he was playing ob­
scure clubs 360 nights a year. But 
from the minute he first stepped 
up to the microphone, his dyna­
mite soul filled the hall with red- 
hot electric blues.
Success hasn’t spoiled B. B. 
King, but it’s been a long time 
coming. Born 45 years ago in In- 
dianola, Miss., Rily B. King came 
out of the same soil as the great 
old Delta bluesmen like Robert 
Johnson, Blind Lemon Jefferson, 
Fred McDowell, John Hurt, and 
B. B.’s counsin, Bukka White. B. 
B. grew up on a plantation, pick­
ing cotton for a living and begin­
ning to acquire that peculiar feel­
ing in your heart known as the 
blues. He started playing electric 
guitar in the manner of the blues­
men up North in Chicago, and 
picked up a distinctive style that 
was more than just another sound, 
but a way of playing with the feel­
ing of a true artist. After a stint 
as a disc jockey under the name 
“Blues Boy” King, he shortened 
it to “B.B.” and began touring as
a guitarist/singer, playing to 
small dance clubs in the South 
where people dig the real blues, 
but don’t have money to pay for it. 
For close to 20 years, B. B. King 
went from club to club with only 
a rare day off, and in that time he 
was involved in 14 car accidents 
where the vehicle was totally de­
stroyed.
B. B. was still singing his blues 
to the few who would listen, 
when new sounds began coming 
from the white rock world. 
People like the Rolling Stones, 
John Mayall, and Cream were 
playing music that some called 
the “British” sound, but that 
was actually adopted Chicago 
blues, in the style of men like 
Muddy Waters, Howlin’ Wolf, 
Otis Rush, Buddy Guy—and a 
man named B. B. King. In Amer­
ica, people like Paul Butterfield 
and Mike Bloomfield picked up 
the sound. One night early in 
1968, the Cafe a Go Go in New 
York scheduled a super-jam be­
tween Eric Clapton of Cream, EI- 
vin Bishop of the Butterfield Blues 
Band, and a black cat named B. 
B. King. Clapton and Bishop 
each put on a show of flash and 
dexterity, and then it’s the 
black guy’s turn. Lilian Roxon 
describes it: “Well, for a start, 
old B. doesn’t even stand up. He 
doesn’t have to. He just sits back 
in his chair, still relaxing, smil­
ing a little and smoking his Ti- 
parillo, and suddenly he just lets 
go a little pure and ever-so-sim- 
ple soul. Like he’s been doing 
this for a long time. No fancy 
playing now, just a couple of 
strokes, and—well, the whole 
room is wiped out.” (From The 
Encyclopedia of Rock.)
At about the same time, peo­
ple who were really interested 
in the blues began tracing the roots 
of Clapton and Mayall and Bloom­
field and kept bumping into the 
name B. B. King. The pieces be­
gan to fit together. Soon he was 
playing the Fillmore East to 
standing «ovations from the hip, 
white audiences. Last year he play­
ed Las Vegas, and just recently he 
won the Grammy Award for the 
best rhythm and blues song, “The 
Thrill Is Gone.”
AND Saturday night he played in 
Carnegie Hall and showed every­
one that success hasn’t touched B. 
B. King’s soul. After a couple of 
instrumental numbers by the very 
talented Sonny Freeman and the 
Unusuals, he was brought on as 
“The King of the Blues—B. B. 
King” and was greeted by an en­
thusiastic standing ovation. He 
began singing his standard, “Ev­
ery Day I Got the Blues.” Before 
the first verse was through, the 
audience was stomping and yell­
ing. A lot of the people there 
seemed to be very young, white 
kids who were just cheering for 
a name they had heard mentioned 
a lot, but there were many sin­
cere white blues fans, and quite a 
few young blacks to whom B. B. 
King was part of a way of life. In 
front of where I was sitting, three 
middleaged (at least) black wom­
en stomped and yelled and clapped 
from the minute King walked on 
stage. But, as B. B. told me after 
the show, “Everybody got the 
blues, black or white, or red or 
yellow, everybody got the blues,” 
and certainly everybody in the 
hall that night could feel the emo­
tion of his performance.
Because of some trouble with 
his amp, King didn’t play his gui­
tar. Lucille, till the middle of his 
first number. When the notes did 
begin ringing out, they sliced 
straight to the heart. B. B. 
King’s ability on axe is unsur­
passed: He can alternately tease, 
cajole, or move his audience with 
six strings and an amplifier.
His great showmanship is more 
than a dynamic voice or brilliant 
fingerwork. B. B. will stand at 
the mike, put his hand on his hip, 
roll his eyes, and lets out with 
some smart-ass jive that knocks 
you off your feet. Several times 
Saturday night he walked over to 
his troublesome amplifier and, 
with great show, gave it a good 
swift kick (more often than not 
stopping the trouble, too). His 
perfectly-timed double takes, jive 
raps with song to song, combined 
with his unparalleled abilities as a 
singer and guitarist, make him 
one of the finest and most thrilling 
performers the music world has 
ever seen.
He closed his first set with his 
award-winning “The Thrill Is 
Gone” and left to another standing 
ovation. I had the privilege of be­
ing able to speak with B. B. dur­
ing the intermission and found 
him one of the kindest, warmest 
people I’ve ever met. Everyone
was welcome to his dressing 
room. As the streams of people 
came by, telling him what a fan­
tastic performer he was, all he 
would say was “Thank you, we 
try, we try.” After the show, he 
said how sorry he was that he had 
to hurry off to the airport and 
couldn’t stay to talk with every­
one. To be a dynamite performer 
is one thing, but to be as warm a 
person as B. B. King is can only 
be called greatness.
After two more instrumentals 
by Sonny Freeman and the Un­
usuals, B. B. came back for a set 
that included “Nobody Loves Me But 
My Mother” and “Hummingbird” 
from his recent album, “Indianola 
Mississippi Seeds,” and, perhaps 
his greatest song, the classic 
“Sweet Sixteen.” He played his 
theme song, “Why I Sing the 
Blues” and left the stage, bring­
ing wild cheers for “more” from 
a well ripped-up audience. B. B. 
did two encores and left to hurry 
to his next one-nighter.
Everyone who attended the con­
cert owes great thanks to the Ac­
tivities Board for such a great 
concert. B. B. King is one of the 
very, very few performing gen­
iuses in the popular music world, 
and his concert Saturday night 
was certainly a fine and welcome 
taste of the best of the blues.

It’s now the fourth issue I’ve 
been with the TARTAN staff, and 
the last issue of the semester. So 
far, I’ve refrained from making 
any statements of policy, how I 
plan to do things, what I’d like 
to get done. I hadn’t even formu­
lated any, thinking it would not 
be necessary. But I’ve now dis­
covered that the position of fea­
tures editor places one in an odd 
category on the TARTAN: he has 
no authority. The problem re­
mains, what powers does this 
position have that cannot be ex­
ercised?
I’m not really up for hassles 
with TARTAN writers. The con­
tributors to this paper are volun­
tary, and as long as they remain 
such, the writers and reporters 
can do much as they please. 
Which means it’s easy to say 
goodbye to a contributor if he 
doesn’t like what is done with 
his material. (On three occasions 
I told myself and informed the 
TARTAN that I saw no reason to 
contribute if there were no chance 
of having the material printed. As 
if I were delivering an ultimatum. 
Bye.)
I must confess that earlier this 
year, as a mere contributor of 
cartoons, I was a persistent hass- 
ler myself. I always felt paranoia 
about the reasons I wasn’t print­
ed, and thus made it somewhat 
hard on the TARTAN staff, asking 
for all sorts of explanations. This 
is an apology to the last features 
editor, I don’t know if I will have 
as much patience, which consti- 
tues the reason for this article.
At that time, there were no an­
swers for me, only sympathy. I 
was not the only one edged out 
of these pages. So now that I 
can have practically anything 
I submit printed, you may think 
this is the wrong time to talk. 
On the contrary, my interest is
Cynic's Corner
just in the quality of the news­
paper. If that corresponds to 
improving the contents, I’m into 
that as well.
And so I’m a features editor 
myself now. (Sounds like a movie 
in which kids grow up.) I have a 
regular column and/or cartoon 
if I want it. I also have the al­
leged job of editing the features. 
Editing the features consists of 
proofreading articles and im­
proving faulty or unclear word­
ing, having the option to cut dead 
words from material and the op­
tion to inject some interest into a 
lifeless article, and selecting 
those features which provide the 
TARTAN and its readers the most 
value.
What is a features editor, by 
Craig Collins, the end.
Here, however, it seems one 
cannot perform those duties with­
out trampling people’s spirits, 
and, more often than not, provok­
ing their angers. What I feel to 
be my responsibility to the TAR­
TAN appears to hurt writers’ jour­
nalistic feelings. Thus, I have 
the choice of leaving articles 
which need doctoring alone, and, 
with that, releasing a poorer 
quality paper, or attempting to 
improve those articles and invit­
ing contributors’ wrath. Is this 
even a choice?
I seem to be coming across as 
being scissors-happy. Ideally, I 
would like to leave all articles as 
they are submitted. That, people, 
is impossible, so cut me a break. 
My objective is the quality of 
TARTAN journalism (leave the 
posters up).

I don’t like hype. Features with 
wildly enthusiastic sentences 
followed by multiple exclamation 
points are unsettling to me. Hype, 
the selling of an event or publica­
tion using bandwagon enthusiasm, 
is a carry-over from high school 
newspapers. There, writers use 
hype to sell dances, games, and 
other activities because it is the 
only selling technique they know. 
Hype should have no place in the 
TARTAN, though. I’d rather see 
a concert plug which says, “I like 
them,” than one like “get your 
tickets now, because everyone 
will want to see this freaked- 
out group!” Sincerity and objec­
tivity are good alternatives to 
hype, but are not as common. I’ve 
printed hype so far because of a 
fear of stepping on certain or­
ganizational toes. Next year, 
please, people, don’t hand me 
raving reviews and previews 
and expect it verbatim. There are 
other ways to sell.
I don’t dig outside help. I’d bet­
ter clarify this, or more people 
will be down my neck. I plan to 
be in this position for a while, and 
thus it is important to discover 
now for myself what is to be done 
with the job. “Advice,” when of­
fered as advice, is okay. I can’t 
handle being helped with what 
I’m doing (TARTAN staff ex­
cluded, of course), mainly because 
I want to make my own mistakes 
and correct them myself. So, next 
year when I play features editor, 
I will be the only one filling that 
part. I have an idea of what I want
and the only way to get it is “do it 
thyself.” I plan to.
Again, so far this year, I have 
listened and taken all sorts of ad­
vice from people concerning what 
to print where, how to lay it out, 
and the like. I think I should be 
competdnt enough by next year to 
handle it. If not, I’ll return to my 
role as whining contributor.
There are certain people here 
one doesn’t touch, I find. And cer­
tain organizations. Freedom of 
the press again breaks down when 
one has to censure himself for 
“people in influential places.” 
There are many people who can 
make trouble for the TARTAN 
and myself. What can I say? The 
truth usually hurts, and the per­
son who speaks the truth is hurt 
more as a result. “Just watch yer 
step.”
The conclusion is the newspa­
pers, for the most part, are farces, 
because they print only what the 
social atmosphere allows them.
ONE: What was that all about?
TWO: I don’t know, but its sure 
was a lot of bull!
ONE: What did he say, that’s the 
question!
TWO: He said he wants to do it 
himself.
ONE: Remember those Anacin 
commercials?
TWO: Maybe he needs an aspirin.
ONE: Try a laxative—he sounds 
constipated.
TWO: Why doesn’t he cut his own 
article if he’s so up on editing.
ONE: He’s power hungry — the 
job’s gone to his head.
TWO: Better than hearing him 
complain about never getting 
anything printed.
ONE: I was stoned before I read 
this, now I’m down.
TWO: Your move.

Queen of Spades, putting him in
the lead.)

Center Offers "Male Session
r>r>
The Planned Parenthood Center of Pittsburgh 
has recently introduced a new program for men 
called the “Male Session.” Designed to be an edu­
cational service for the community, the Male Ses­
sion is open every Monday evening from 4:30 until
7 and is located at 526 Penn Ave. on the tenth floor 
of the Jackman Building, downtown.
As part of this new program, the Session offers 
contraceptive information, information about 
venereal disease, its prevention and symptoms, 
and information about vasectomy procedures. It 
also provides professional counseling, including 
marriage counseling, and rap sessions in all areas 
relating to male sexual problems and responsibilities 
Non-prescription contraceptive supplies are sold 
at minimal cost (for example, one dozen for $1) dur­
ing Session hours.
In an effort to maintain an unrestrained atmos­
phere where men will feel free to talk out their prob­
lems, the staff is entirely male. Most are young 
graduate school students trained under the auspices 
of the Center. In addition, there is always a pro­
fessional counselor available at each Session.
The Male Session was created to provide the 
young man or student with a source of informa­
tion which would otherwise be unavailable to him 
any place lese in the area. There are no papers to 
fill out, no forms to sign—just people who would 
like to answer your questions and try to help you deal 
with your problems. If you would like more infor­
mation, call 281-9502 or simply drop by on Monday 
evening.

Alumni Present Conference on Pollution.
As students of this university 
we are always complaining about 
the fact that the administrators 
and alumni don’t care about re­
levant issues like the war and 
pollution. Now in the area of 
pollution, something is finally 
being done. The C-MU Alumni 
association presents the Elev­
enth Carnegie Conference on 
May 1, 1971. The subject: “Pol­
lution: Planning Our Environ­
ment.’’
The birth-life-death cycle of 
man is a natural phenomenon. 
What he consumes, nature re­
news. What he destroys, nature 
recreates. The earth is equipped 
to nourish and sustain human 
life.
But man’s technology scars the 
environment. Unlike the organic 
waste products of man, the in­
organic residues and by-products 
of technology do not decom­
pose naturally. They contamin­
ate the soil, corrupt the water 
supply, poison the air. Pollution 
of the environment damages 
the regenerative cycle and threa­
tens life on this planet.
If man is to reverse the de­
structive effect of the abuse of 
technology upon the environ­
ment, he must not only harness 
his scientific knowledge and 
technical skill, but liberate his 
imagination.
The Carnegie Conference, 
“Pollution: Planning Our En­
vironment,” offers an opportun­
ity to obtain accurate technical 
information about the problem, 
to investigate public programs 
designed to control pollution, 
and to exchange creative ideas.
The conference will open with 
an overview, a general and com­
prehensive definition of the pol­
lution problem. Next will come 
more specialized and technical 
investigations of air water, and 
solid-waste pollution by experts 
in those fields. The luncheon 
speaker, U.S. Senator Gaylord 
Nelson, will examine the pollu­
tion problem from the perspec­
tive of governmental action and 
legislation. After Senator Nel­
son’s speech, the four morning 
speakers will form a panel to 
query, debate, and summarize 
the ideas presented thus far. 
The conference will conclude 
with a panel composed of rep­
resentatives from official agen­
cies, private industry, and com­
munity action groups. This pan-

GENERAL
CONFERENCE
( Continued from Paqe 1 )
Dr. Schatz, Vice-President of 
Academic Affairs, then turned 
the Council’s attention to a re­
port concerning the campus-wide 
commission of the Status and 
Needs of Women and the Car- 
negie-Mellon University Aca­
demic Women. The former com­
mission, which is chaired by 
Ruth Beach, has been assigned 
several functions:
1) To examine all areas of 
University operations as they 
pertain to the general problems 
of the status of women, includ­
ing: (a) the admission of women 
students (both undergraduate 
and graduate), the placement 
service available to such stu­
dents, the housing of women 
students, their treatment in the 
classroom, the educational and 
occupational counseling they 
receive, and such other areas 
as the Commission may deter­
mine; (b) the employment, re­
tention, promotion, and salaries 
of women of the faculty and 
staff, the distribution of males 
and females in various employ­
ment categories, and such other
matters as the Commission may 
determine.
2) To recommend policies,
procedures, organizational ar­
rangements and special services
which if believed will enhance 
the opportunities of women to 
achieve their personal and pro­
fessional goals at Carnegie- 
Mellon.
3) To suggest the outline of 
an affirmative action program 
designed to correct or amelior­
ate any discriminatory prac­
tices or unequal conditions dis­
covered in the Commission's 
study.
4) To recommend a continu­
ing vehicle for monitoring the 
implementation of an affirma­
tive action program and to sug­
gest which offices within the 
University should be responsible 
for various aspects of implemen­
tation.
The rest of the report explain­
ed what developments have
come about as a result of the C- 
MU Academic Women. This 
group has proposed a children’s 
day care center on campus,
additional courses on female
studies, and a reference library 
for female studies.

Sorority Thwarts Morewood Robbery
(Continued from Page 1)
fists. The victim was knocked from the chair in which he was sitting, 
onto the floor. Both men then pulled him up and told him to lie 
face down on the bed. When the victim lay down, he was tied and 
gagged. The men used drapery cord to tie his hands and feet, and 
strips of a torn pillow case to blindfold and gag him.
After locking the door, the men proceeded to ransack the 
room. They noticed a stereo system and began dismantling it. In 
addition, the victim’s wrist watch, eyeglass case, and billfold were 
taken from his person. At some point during the twenty to thirty 
minute period that the men were in the victim’s room, they placed 
a foot locker across the back of the victim’s legs.
Two security officers met the two students who had originally 
noticed the suspicious persons, and those students pointed out the 
room in which the robbery was taking place. One of the students 
had actually seen the two men enter the victim’s room. Sgt. Schoet- 
tle then approached the room, tried the doorknob and found the 
door locked. According to the victim’s testimony, when the intrud­
ers heard the door being tried, they went to the window, opening 
it. Sobel stated that he heard one of them saying something about 
it being ‘too high’. They then closed the window.
The men then decided to leave the room. Upon opening the 
door, they were greeted by Sgt. Schoettle and Officer Purifoy. They 
were taken into custody, searched, and identified. Sgt. Schoettle 
advised them of their rights. The suspects were then directed to lay 
face down in the hallway and Officer Purifoy covered them with 
his service revolver, while Sgt. Schoettle freed the victim.
City police had been notified by the Security Office as soon 
as the call came in. At 8:55 p.m., the prisoners were taken by city 
police to the Public Safety Building.
Arrested were Willie James Woods, 23, a former C-MU student 
and Junies E. Patterson, 22.
Ron Taylor, in response to the events on Saturday stated, “Our 
robbery reports indicate, either from the initial words of the robber, 
or from statements of witnesses, that the motivation for picking vic­
tims on the Carnegie-Mellon University campus is the assumption 
that students here do possess quantities of drugs. Our own investiga­
tions have not positively indicated that the victims did, in fact, pos­
sess drugs; but, we do feel that the possibility had definitely existed 
in some cases either this year or the last year.
“The initial words of the robber in this particular incident did 
indicate a belief that drugs were available here; and to the extent 
that such is either fact or belief, our campus will be seen as an 
‘easy touch’.”
He further stated, “A student’s alertness and committment to 
University security was directly responsible for the apprehension of 
two adult male suspects who are charged with robbery assault and 
battery upon one of our students. The method of operation in this 
particular robbery was similar to many in the past, with one very 
important exception. The students had the initiative to report an 
observation of unknown persons entering a dorm room and the door 
being closed. The information was then related to security with the 
result that Security Services Officers were able to respond and 
make the arrests before the suspects were able to leave the room.
“The security of the student depends upon all of our efforts, 
and the student action in this situation should serve as an example 
to all campus participants, i.e.
1. Made observation of suspicious behavior
2. Promptly relayed information to Security Services
3. Stood near the scene and directed Security Officers to “risk 
situation”

“The end result of team effort was to epitomize the security of 
our campus.”
Efforts have been made to determine whether the two suspects 
in this robbery were in any way implicated in previous robberies 
on the C-MU campus. Victims of previous robberies were asked to 
try to identify the suspects in a line-up on Sunday. Only one pre­
vious victim stated that he was 70 percent sure that one of the two 
suspects had. indeed, robbed him.
A hearing for the two suspects will be held on Monday, May 
3, in Citv Court.

DAVID VENZIE wins the 100 against St. Francis. Time: 1 0.2 sec.Photo by Tom Lampl
The hurdles races were rather 
unusual: school-record holder in 
the 440 hurdles, Henry Finch, 
tried his hand at the highs and 
won in 16.9. Mark Erskine was 
second. Then in the 440 hurdles, 
Tony McKay, the premier flat 
quarter-miler, made his debut 
over the barriers to run first in 
his heat and second to Finch over­
all. Jim Tomayko made it a clean 
sweep of the three heats for Car­
negie, running in blue jeans, a 
shirt and his spikes, as he had al­
ready showered and changed af­
ter his mile run.
The field events were largely 
won by the opposition, but BRIAN 
Crowley brought in points by fin­
ishing second in the shot, second 
in the javelin and third in the dis­
cus. Ken Buzzard had a second in 
the disc and third in the shot. 
Tony McKay won the broad jump
against St. Francis but was sec­
ond against Waynesburg. Fred 
Yosua duplicated those .placings 
in the triple jump. Erskine took 
the vault, with Ken Stevens sec­
ond. Wendell Miller’s 5’10” high 
jump was enough for a first and 
second.
The meet at Thiel on Wednes­
day should be a Carnegie win, as 
Thiel only defeated Geneva by 
one, with Carnegie already beat­
ing them by over 20. Three sen­
iors close out their careers this 
week, Joe Lorhan, already men­
tioned, Mike Fotta, and Jim Tom­
ayko. Lorhan has been a consis­
tent point gatherer in the 880 and 
440, as well as often putting in a 
leg on either the mile or 440 re­
lays. His 2:00.9 880 of last season 
was the fastest recorded by a Tar­
tan in recent years. Fotta’s forte
is the sprints. Even though he has 
been hobbled much of this season 
by injuries, his contributions in 
past years have been considerable 
at the 100, 220 and 440 and related 
relay distances. Jim Tomayko has 
never been worth much for points, 
but has been the most consistent 
improver on the team, this year 
lowering his times in every evdnt 
from the 440 to the three-mile 
despite a hamstring injury. He 
has, at one time or another, com­
pleted in every running event.
Thus Coach Meckley can look 
forward to the return of all but 
three of his 1971 squad of winners, 
and, as the losses are spread out 
over several events, nowhere will 
the team’s balance be affected. 
Perhaps Meckley’s dream of a 
thoroughly positive-minded team 
of winners will be fully realized.

The Tartan thinclads split a 
double-duel during Carnival, los­
ing to Case, 88-57, and taking Ge­
neva, 89-56. This brought the over­
all record to 4-4 and the double 
win Monday against St. Francis 
(107-35) and Waynesburg (85-60) 
assured the Carnegie squad of its 
second consecutive winning sea­
son with only the one meet to go. 
k The weather Monday was not 
conducive to fast times. That, 
plus the weak competition ruled 
out any late-season record at­
tempts, and caused Coach Meck­
ley to experiment with the lineup 
as the score piled up increasingly 
in the Tartans’ favor.
The 440 relay team continued 
its string of wins with a 44.5 clock­
ing that defeated both of the op- 
r ponents. Three-fourths of this 
group, Dave Venzie, Jay Corpus, 
and lay Gazdacko went on to fin­
ish in that order in the 100, sweep­
ing both of the other teams. The 
time was 10.2. Venzie and Gaz­
dacko repeated their placings in 
the 220, with a surprising Chuck 
McDonough finishing seconp. Mc­
Donough, who has been running in 
the shadow of Tony McKay all 
season, took advantage of Mc­
Kay’s absence in the 440 to win 
it with a time of 52.5.
The distance runners had an 
outstanding day, Ed Schenk upset­
ting Ken Kloes in the mile 4:45.4 
to 4:46.1 to take second against 
Waynesburg and first against St. 
Francis. Kloes came back in the 
two-mile to win in 10:27.5 with 
Schenk second and Dennis Sulli­
van, injured through much of the 
season, getting third in the sweep 
of St. Francis.
The 880 was Joe Lorhan’s final 
race of his career, and, despite 
leading for 660 yards, was pow­
erfully outkicked by a Waynes­
burg runner at the finish. Tom Sil- 
vis was right behind Lorhan and 
thus the placings were 1-2- 
against St. Francis and 2-3 against 
Waynesburg.

1) Throwing overboard dishes, sleeping bags, winchcranks, 
crews, tools or any gear of any potential use is strongly

2) Due to the presence of the captain's wife aboard, the 
special rights traditionally enjoyed by the captain over 
the females of the boat are transferred to the Social

\ cold blustering wind was 
blowing and temperatures ranged 
from the low 40’s to a high of 
about 55. Yet, Spring Carnival 
1971 was upon us and where we 
find Carnival we find buggy 
races.
The buggy races, I must ad­
mit, are the one fraternity orient­
ed activity that I allow myself 
to get into. Unfortunately, this 
year there just wasn’t much ex­
citement to involve an emotion­
al response. Buggy has become 
a two house competition between 
Pika and Beta. Everyone else is 
simply outclassed, and it’s be­
ginning to appear that Beta is
I also falling into a category 
apart from Pika. Pika’s buggy 
free rolls at amazing speed,
* they have a superlative driver 
who makes the difficult turn on­
to Frew Street as easily as Bar­
ry Benjamin completes a pass, 
and their hill one pusher, Mr. 
Fota, makes sure his competi­
tors are looking forward to the 
Pika buggy from the opening 
gun. The Betas who finished se­
cond and third for the second 
r. ^straight year revel in the abili- 
J ties of their pushers. On the
back hills they may be invinci­
ble but “825” and P.O.S. (I
won’t explain the derivation of 
the latter name) are unbelieva­
bly difficult to get to the free 
roll through the park. (Editor’s 
note: This is because the Beta 
buggies are heavier than Pika’s.) 
Even when this Herculean task 
is accomplished, the abilities 
of the Beta buggies during free 
roll is erratic. So the much
awaited rematch ended with the
Beta buggies battling for sec­
ond place.
As for the rest of the field,
ATO deserves mention for fin­
ishing fourth. This is quite an 
achievement, especially since 
they had to pass the brake test
twice to accomplish this feat.
This is something I had not pre­
viously seen in my travels 
through C-MU. Onward to fifth 
place and the Delts. It was good 
to see the Delts make a decent 
showing after the tragic accident 
which occurred during the week. 
They have been improving dur­
ing the past few years and may 
be a factor in the future. Sigma 
Nu turned in the second best 
time of the weekend but does 
not appear in the final results 
since they failed the brake test. 
This is not unusual because their 
buggy has the same design as 
ATO.
All in all, the races were a 
rerun of 1970 Carnival without 
the excitement generated at 
last year’s event. Pika’s compe­
titors had better go back to the 
drawing board and come up with 
better buggies or the poor sap 
who is asked to write next year’s 
article on the buggy races is go­
ing to face the same problem I 
have. How can one write an in­
teresting column about a bor­
ing event? So, come on Beta - 
design another winning buggy, 
come on ATO and Sigma Nu- 
design one that runs fast and 
stops — come on Tau Delt and 
SAE (no, not again) - design a 
buggy instead of the hopeless 
bikes. Until then, hats off to the 
Pikas.
