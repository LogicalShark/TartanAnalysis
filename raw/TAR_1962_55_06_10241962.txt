Three Girls Await Crowning of Fall Queen 
On October 19, As Fall Festivities Begin
L»vLast Friday, October 19, the 
men of Carnegie Tech selected the 
following three freshman girls as 
finalists for Fall Festival Queen 
and court: ,
Caroline McWilliams, Drama;
Sally Ann Morley, drama;
Susan Schumacher, history;
Although the Queen has already 
keen chosen by Friday’s ballot, 
her name will be withheld until»themoment she is crowned.
The crowning, will take place 
immediately before the beginning 
of the pep rally and bon fire on 
the Edward’s Property behind 
Morewood Gardens Friday night 
of Fall Festival. The queen will 
officially open the weekend’s fes­
tivities, and her reign will con­
tinue from Friday evening until 
after the dance on Saturday 
night.
The 1962 Fall Festival Queen 
will be crowned by last year’s 
Homecoming Queen, Arlene Win­
ner. On Saturday, the three 
reigning beauties will be pre­
sented at the football game and 
Arlene will present the new queen 
with a sheaf of roses. These activi­
ties will be climaxed by a special 
television appearance on Friday 
morning.
phisticated self-amusement, good 
conversation and the successful 
representation of Carnegi;- Tech, 
It provides a forum in which fac­
ulty members may meet the for­
eign students on a casual basis; 
it its parties, a chance to meet 
examples of exotic varieties of 
local fauna and, at the numerous 
country - wide conferences to 
which it sends delegates, an op­
portunity to exchange views and 
participate in debates.
Americans are welcome, if they 
do not mind being in the min­
ority and are willing to defend the 
ideals of God, Mother and Coun­
try.
Parade Begins 
Fall Festival
This Friday, Fall Festival will 
open with a Torch Light Parade 
and Bonfire. The Parade begins at 
Donner Hall at 7:15 p.m. and pro­
ceeds to the Edward’s property 
behind Morewood Gardens. There, 
the Fall Festival Queen will be 
crowned followed by original 
cheers presented by each frater­
nity’s pledge class. The Tech 
football team will also be intro­
duced at this time.
Dress is casual and everyone u 
invited to join in the parade.

On Saturday, October 20, Pan- 
hellenic Council held its second 
informal rush function, a “Meet 
the Sororities Tea” in the More­
wood Recreation Room.
After Elaine Hinkle, the Presi­
dent of Panhellenic Council wel­
comed the freshmen, Dean Milli­
gan spoke on the purposes of rush 
on Tech’s campus, and Mrs. Fair- 
man, advisor to Panhellenic Coun­
explained the aims and ob­
jectives of National Panhellenic 
Council through the formal rush 
season.
Sue Weisshaus, Panhellenic
Rush Chairman, outlined formal 
rush rules, and, aided by Marney 
Gilboy, Panhellenic Projects
Chairman, answered the prospec­
tive rushees’ questions.
Seven girls from each sorority 
represented their chapter at the 
tea. Displays set up by each group, 
consisting of such things as soror­
ity insignia, chapter composites, 
and trophies, served as an in­
troduction to the individual so­
rorities.
Lynn Pasternak, Panhellenic
Sorority girls greet potential rushees at get-acquainted tea. Social Chairman, provided punchand cookies for the tea.
Sue Weisshaus aptly defined the 
spirit of Pan Hellenic in her 
speech when she said, “And just 
remember, no matter whether or 
not you pledge, or which sorority 
you pledge, we’ll still love you!”
International Club Discusses 
Present Status of Women
In the tradition of the International Club, each year one 
or two debates are devoted to the discussion of women in so­
ciety. This year they will consider the problem — “Has wom­
an, in gaining power, lost her influence; has she, by demand­
ing her rights, lost her privileges? Is she satisfied with her
changing role? Most important, 
are men still satisfied with her?”
The first debate in thif series 
will take place on Sunday, Octo­
ber 28 at 8:00 p.m. in Skibo’s 
Room, The speakers at this 
debate will be people with quali­
fied opinions and, hopefully, ex­
perience in the topical area. Pro­
fessor James and Mrs. Rosem- 
berg of the Drama department, 
Miss Cecil Kitcat, Professor of 
Stage-movement and Dance, and 
Professor Robert Gabriel, the 
well-known sculpturer will speak 
and answer questions.

cial organization, primarily for

The dedication of the new Alan 
M. Scaife Hall of Engineering was 
held on the campus last Wednes­
day morning.
The Scaife Hall of Engineering, 
constructed at a cost of approxi- 
ately $1,400,000, was made pos­
sible by a gift from the Sarah 
Mellon Scaife Foundation. This 
building is the fourth constructed 
under T*ech’s ten-year $29,000,000 
development program.
The dedication address was de­
livered by Dr. Edward R. Weid­
lein, former president of Mellon 
Institute. Speaking of Alan M. 
r^Scaife, Dr. Weidlein told the as­
sembled guests, faculty members 
and students that “Engineering 
and medicine are becmoing more 
dependent upon each other every 
day and, as an illustration Mr. 
Scaife supported an extensive in­
vestigation in the field of ortho­
pedic appliances in an effort to re­
habilitate the handicapped. In 
fact, he was also a great student 
of aviation, a perfectionist, a lead­
er of men, and an outstanding cit- 
<%izen in the community, devoting 
the greater part of his life to help­
ing make Pittsburgh a better place 
in which to live and work. He had 
a conviction that in the years to 
come, engineers would become in­
creasingly ingenious and the 
world would eventually become 
more stable as a result.”
Dr. Weidlein commented on the 
position of the engineer in today’s 
^society. “The scientific knowledge 
*which has made possible modern 
industry was acquired slowly, for
the most part, in the technical 
schools and universities of the 
world by men who were stimu­
lated by curiosity, The time has 
arrived when the engineering 
schools require modern facilities 
and expensive equipment such as 
is being provided b> the Scaife 
family for the benefit of C.I.T.,” 
he said. “This institution today 
stands among the leaders in train­
ing engineers and scientists, so 
what better place could there be 
to construct these outstanding 
modern facilities.
“The engineer creates our tech­
nological world. He is the one who 
transforms the data nature grudg­
ingly discloses into useful prod­
ucts for the benefit of mankind. 
One can hope that those who fix 
the destinies of nations will ask 
of the engineer of tomorrow that 
he use his talent only to help 
build a better environment for 
men everywhere.”
Mr. Richard M. Scaife, vice- 
chairman of the Sarah Mellon 
Scaife Foundation, and son of 
Alan M. Scaife, formally dedi­
cated the building by unveiling 
the memorial inscription identify*- 
ing the building.
Dennis A. Gary, a senior in the 
department of mechanical engi­
neering from Campbell, Ohio, 
speaking on behalf of the stu­
dents, said “Our promise to the 
donors, the faculty, and the trus­
tees of Carnegie Tech is that 
while we are students here, we

Cecile Flad, Exchange Student, 
Comments on America and Tech
By Marion Mulligan
Cecile Flad, sitting by her desk 
in the penthouse at Morewood 
Gardens, smiled and said, “The 
American people are so friendly.”
Cecile, a petite, young Parisian, 
is studying at Tech this year on a 
scholarship from Panhellenic 
Council.
Already a certified teacher in 
France, Cecilia has written a 
thesis for her university degree 
there and had one year of student 
teaching experience. She is con­
tinuing her studies in foods and 
nutrition in Margaret Morrison 
College.
Speaking fluent English, Cecile 
thumbed through her dictionary 
only once to find the exact word 
she wanted to use. “Well,” she ex­
claimed, “I had six years of Eng­
lish at home. And I spent three 
summers in England. I’m picking 
up American slang by reading 
your books.” <¦
With such a background of the 
language, Cecile easily made com- [ 
parisons of campus life here and | 
in Europe.
Commenting on the differences, 
she sad. “It is so rare the way you 
introduce freshmen to the teach- I 
ers and the administration. In 
France new students are lost, but 
not here. I was shown through 
Margaret Morrison College three 
different times!”
She added that she finds classes 
more informative here and enjoys 
the conversation between student 
and teacher.
“I like the library,” she stated 
emphatically. In France, it seems 
that there are few assignments 
which require reference or source 
reading. Cecile finds that this type 
of reading adds to the value of her 
courses.
BULLETIN BOARD

when you eat a dish here, it al­
ways tastes the same. Never 
changes. But in France — every­
one cooks it a little bit differently.
An apple tart there never tastes 
the same twice. I believe it is not 
like that here because of your 
mechanization.”
She continued her list of inter­
est at Tech — Film Arts and dorm 
life% “You see, students live at 
home or in boarding houses when 
they attend the university in 
boarding houses when they attend 
the university in France. This is 
the first time I’ve stayed in a 
student dormitory.”
Cecile lived with her family 
while studying in Paris. Of the six 
children in her family, one brother 
is studying business; one, archi­
tecture. One works in an office 
and the other is with the United 
Nations in Africa. Her sister does 
research work in a chemical labo­
ratory. Cecile is the first of her 
family to visit the United States.
In Pittsburgh she likes the view 
from the top of Mt. Washington 
the best. “Even if you see all the 
black chimneys from the factories, 
it doesn’t matter, realliy. It’s a 
lovely view.”
But she wants to see more of 
the United States before returning 
to France next summer. She hopes 
to see more of New York City, go 
to Washington, and possibly visit 
a ranch out west. “Don’t laugh at 
that one, please,” she added.

Editorial
Take Your Nose Out Of Textbooks
In the Preface of the Carnegie catalogue 
there is a statement of the Carnegie Plan.
“Mastery of basic knowledge and ability 
to use it effectively in situations new to the 
student shall be the gauge whereby a Car­
negie student’s progress is measured.”
Tech’s students have been told over and 
over again that there is more to this basic 
knowledge than text book material. One 
course of this broader education which many 
students overlook is the Tuesday Assembly 
series. The programs are scheduled at 11:30 
Tuesday when all students are free. They 
only last an hour; yet the topics covered may 
include anything from inter-national prob­
lems to art and philosophy.
Two weeks ago Dr. Franklin Littell spoke 
on totalitarianism. He said that a democrat­
ic form of government is not what is keeping 
us from totalitarianism, for Hitler used to 
receive 98% of the vote in democratic elec­
tions. He stated that it was free discussion 
of all sides of the question which kept us 
free. He then asked the audience what was 
happening to America when ideas were 
labeled as John Birch or radical Communist 
and the people are jeered at and isolated.
Last week Professor Hazard of G.S.I.A.
told the assembly we have seven choices to 
make nationally. Either we put all our ef­
forts into public works like hospitals and 
forget about cultural or we build more 
theaters. Either we chooce between birth- 
control or overcrowding in twenty years. 
Either we choose between good mass trans­
portation or cultural stagnation in the sub­
urbs. You may not agree with these ideas, 
but they do make you think.
The areas covered by the coming assem­
blies should be just as broad and stimulat­
ing. Speakers scheduled include a Peace 
Corps representative, a Dutch novelist and 
critic, the ex-Argentitive to the U.N. and the 
new heads of the Painting and Design and 
Drama departments.
Your chances of hearing the view pre­
sented in the assemblies and of talking to 
the caliber of speakers are slim after you 
leave college. Yet these ideas should be a 
part of everyone’s basic knowledge. If more 
people attended the assemblies, the picture 
of the Tech engineer or Maggie Murph who 
knows nothing of national problems or art 
or religion would fade rapidly. So come to 
the next Tuesday Assembly at 11:30 in the 
Fine Arts Theater.

New OutlookDorm Council
Spend American \ And Axelrad
By Stephen I. Miller
In this year of our Lord 1962, we are faced with many 
problems which our ancestors were seldom confronted. 
Chief amongst these is the problem of unemployment. Its 
existence seems to be an accepted fact by most economists. 
They say that it is inevitable. We must have unemployment 
but usually at a level of 3%. Today this figure has more 
than doubled to about 7.8%. It has reached the status of 
a true national emergency. The figures are of course an 
average over the United States as a whole. In some areas 
such as Pittsburgh and its suburbs unemployment has 
reached the staggering figure of 15-20%.
This loss is being felt especially by the skilled and semi­
skilled workers of the steel, vehicles, and construction in­
dustries. These industries which are the basis of our 
economy are the hardest hit. Unfortunately we can not 
blame it completely in automation. The truth is that our 
markets are continually shrinking and thus our firms have 
no choice but to cut costs by laying off men.
In the midst of all of this our government spending is 
ever on the increase and its income on the decrease. This 
too will continue as long as does unemployment. Thus we 
have a continuous circle which is helping all too few. Yet, to 
us, there seems to be a rather obvious solution.
Why can’t our government spend directly to help our 
industries. Yearly we give away semi-fabulous sums in 
foreign aid to underdeveloped nations. This is supposedly 
for development and growth, but it’s surprising how little of 
it is ever used for this purpose. We deliver the money to a 
ruling monarch, who can then spend it as he sees fit. Unfor­
tunately, his visions do not coincide with ours and all too 
frequently our money never gets past the upper echelons 
of the government or at best only a small fraction gets 
down to the people.
Now again I ask my question, why can’t our govern­
ment spend directly within our borders? If we spent a large 
portion of this money internally we could solve at least two 
problems. Instead of giving the money away let’s spend it 
here and purchase the necessary tools for development; 
tractors, bulldozers, plows, etc. We could mass produce 
them with little trouble and this government expenditure 
could help untold people escape the burden of unemploy­
ment. After these goods were manufactured we could then 
deliver the malong with skilled aid to the newly develop­
ing nations and this surely would do more more good for 
both us and the common people of these nations than poorly 
spent foreign aid. Here we could gain the true friendship of 
these massed while limiting our own problems at the same 
time.
Thus a little government action and a slight change in 
technique could help both ourselves and our supposed 
friends all at the same time. There is no reason to suppose 
that this couldn’t work and if it did its results could be stun­
ning.
Issues Argued
Give Suggestions 
But Not Ridicule
Editor, The Tartan:
Once a year it happens, like 
clockwork; a dormitory resident 
pops out of his cell for a minute 
to take a potshot at Men’s Dorm 
Council. Snide, pseudo - sarcastic 
remarks delivered privately do 
not deserve the dignity of a re­
ply; but when they are delivered 
to the campus-at-large, as in a 
letter in last week’s Tartan, 
something should be said in Dorm 
Council’s defense.
As for the parties. All Dorm 
Council can do is set them up. 
No attempt is made to rival the 
“pageants of Nero’s Rome;” but 
anyone who has ever been to one 
of these parties can attest to the 
fact that the hard stuff flows 
freely within administrational 
limits and the bands keep up a 
stream of danceable music 
throughout. Unfortunately the one 
thing that Council cannot buy 
that seems to be in the most de­
mand is a good time for all. I 
had a great time at one of the 
parties, not because I liked the 
brand of the liquor especially, but 
because I was with good company. 
It is the people present that make 
a party good, not the money 
spent. If you are dubious of my 
poor words, look up a fraternity 
social chairman, or Elsa Maxwell; 
I think they will tell you about 
the same. If you want a good 
dormitory party, try going with 
the idea that you are going to 
make conscious effort to have fun 
instead of sitting by with a skep­
tical expression on your face, 
waiting for fun to come along and 
overpower you.
Now for the bulletin board. 
Pardon our ideals; we thought 
the eight kegs of beer would be 
a small sacrifice to make-up for 
the advantages that can come 
from a community bulletin board 
well used. It was not erected as 
an attempt by Dorm Council to 
force-feed culture to dormitory 
residents. That bulletin board 
stands there for the use of any 
residents who think that they may 
have something worthwhile to 
say to the rest of the dormitory 
community. I won’t go into the

National Goals
It seems that it has become accepted that the Ameri­
can nation should have a set of national goals. Both Presi­
dent Eisenhower and President Kennedy have appointed 
commissions to decide what these goals should be—with­
out any large body of citizens objecting. At last Tuesday’s 
assembly Professor Hazard implicitly accepted as truth that 
a nation should have goals, and went on to discuss what 
these goals should be. In doing so he stated that in order 
to realize these goals the American people must discipline 
themselves—at the expense of their freedom. Discipline is ^ 
necessary to reach any national goal; to emphasize some 
activities the nation must slight others.
What is wrong with the present system? Actually today 
there are no specific goals. The government tries to spread 
out its funds so that everyone will be partially satisfied 
with the administration of the nation’s internal improve­
ments. The federal segment of the nation is not the seg­
ment that most vitally affects individuals though-^that seg;- 
ment is the private one. Thus, if the American public wants/ 
westerns, it will get westerns. However a representative 
system based on purchasing power (as America has) has 
its good points. Milton Friedman, a professor at the Uni­
versity of Chicago, has written, “One advantage of this 
type of decision making is that it allows for a system of 
proportional representation in the market place, so that 
minority groups in the society can also make their wishes 
felt.” If the present system is wrong, then it should be 
corrected by allowing one group of persons to allocate^ 
everyone’s money. Today the government sector of the eco­
nomy is a reflection of the private sector — both respect 
minority wishes. Is this wrong?
The establishment of goals necessarily entails the set­
ting up of some authority to enforce the decisions of the 
select group that chooses the nation’s goals for the nation. 
In this way the television networks could be forced to show 
opera (for instance) instead of westerns whether the people^ 
like it or not. The idea of setting national goals is a per- ’ 
version of the idea of representative government. In a rep­
resentative government the wishes of all the people are 
respected. In a goal-orientated government a small group 
decides what the people should have—and that is what the 
people get. Of course this group of goal-setters would be 
appointed by a president who was democratically elected. 
In the United States a goal-orientated state would be no 
more than a dictatorship of the majority.

CURTAIN GOING UP!
For The Record
By Christopher Allen
Just so everybody will know and will no longer have to 
question the fact, I am hereby going on record as being a 
silly-sloppy, pre-maturely senile sentimentalist! The reason 
for this statement is that last night I saw two films that 
did my weary heart untold good. They were the re-releases 
two Walt Disney features, The Lady and The Tramp and 
Almost Angels.
The first film of this wonderful double feature is a heart­
warming romance of the canine world between a pedigreed 
bitch from a nice “home” and a footloose, love-em-and-leave- 
em, soldier of fortune of a mongrel. In addition to the charm­
ing love story is an interesting bit of philosophy by the Dis-
Readers Write (Continued)
Sibley Writes To Residents 
In Defense of Dorm Council
„ney Studios in the presentation of a dog’s eye view of the 
world. It is rare that a human is seen above the knees, and 
then he is seen from dog-height perspective. And table tops 
are impossible to see unless Lady or Tramp happens to be 
standing on the sofa.
The plot of “Lady” takes the couple up street, down 
alley and even to the dog pound where Lady meets Peg 
(voice by Peggy Lee), a song-and-dance girl left over from 
the Dog and Pony Follies, and Boris an Afghan philosopher 
*who quotes Gorki. As can be expected, the couple end up 
happily ever after — with their first litter of four.
The second film of the evening, Almost Angels, is the 
documentary fairy tale of the Vienna Boys’ Choir. There is 
no way to describe the film. It has a plot but it doesn’t 
count much, and it has some story to it. But that matters 
just as little. The best I can do is tell you that I sat fighting 
back tears of sheer joy at the recognition of “real” and tal­
ented boys living life to the hilt, and in the realization of 
their almost unbelievable triumphs. If I am ever to have a 
son I want him to be like any one of these boys were.
[continued, from page 4] 
inferences and conclusions that 
can be drawn if it remains blank.
The fact that Dorm Council 
finished the year with a nice 
positive balance for a change is 
not an indication that the resi­
dents got less in the way of ser­
vices. The pool tables were re­
covered, two new ping-pong tab­
les were built, two television sets 
were fixed and put into service, 
more food machines were in­
stalled, the same number of mo­
vies were shown, and the same 
number of parties were held. The 
surplus funds were due to the 
fact that for the first time, Dorm 
Council was getting a sizeable 
income from a source other than 
activity fees — namely, the food 
machines. It is ridiculius to start 
spending money head-over-heels 
simply because all-of-a-sudden 
you have it. The money is still 
there;no-one has absconded with 
the funds. From now on you in 
the dormitories will be receiving 
more services for the same old 
activity fee.
It has been observed by much 
more eminent authorities than I, 
that those people who write nasty 
letters about service organiza­
tions, governments and the like 
are seldom willing to pitch in and 
try to make said organizations 
and governments work like they 
think they should. But it has al­
ways been a pipe dream of mine 
that someday these people would 
start saying what they want be­
fore they start complaining about 
what they got. Thus, a plea to 
dormitory residents who feel that 
in the recent past their $2.50 has 
been wasted: If you want gold- 
plated shower-heads, if you want 
eight kegs of beer instead of the 
bulletin boards, kindly tell your 
representatives now. Please don’t 
suffer in silence; Dorm Council 
is not an aloof pack of profes­
sionals impervious to suggestion, 
but a bunch of amateurs quite 
interested in anything worthwhile 
that you might want to say.

Axelrad Neglects 
Basic Questions
Editor, The Tartan:
In his article of October 17th, 
Mr. Axelrad dodges some very 
important questions. In proposing 
the abolition of state governments, 
he neglects to discuss some of the 
basic questions of government. 
For instance, why should we even 
have governments? If it is neces­
sary to have governments, from 
what source is their power de­
rived? What are the powers of 
really basic questions, questions 
civil government? These are the 
that if considered would have led 
Mr. Axelrad to different conclu­
sions. In order to answer these 
questions, it is important to re­
view some of the dominant poli­
tical theories of the American 
Revolutionary Period.
During the Revolutionary Per­
iod the political theoreticians were 
influenced by such ideas as na­
tural law, and government by so­
cial compact. That these were the 
political ideas of the time is 
shown by the Declaration of In­
dependence, and the personal 
papers of such men as Thomas 
Jefferson.
Consider the first of these ideas, 
the idea of natural law. Natural 
law was expounded by John 
Locke in his Second Treatise in 
1690. The natural law theory says 
that in the state of nature man 
is bom free. He has the power 
to protect his life, his liberty, and 
his property, and he has the pow­
er to punish one who would take 
these from him. At this point two
things become obvious. First, no 
society can exist for any length 
of time if everybody has this 
“perfect freedom.” The commu­
nity must have the power to pun­
ish those who would take an­
other’s life, liberty, or property. 
Thus, the community must be the 
umpire. Second, if a “normal” 
person had perfect freedom, he 
would soon become a neurotic, 
living in constant fear for his life, 
liberty, and property. Thus the 
necessity for a political commu­
nity.
If a political community is
necessary, as has been shown that 
it is, from what source does this 
political community derive its 
power? Natural law theory says 
that since man is born free, he can 
only be governed by his own con­
sent. Therefore, in order for man 
to be governed, he must enter into 
an agreement with others to form 
a community. The completion of 
this agreement brings a body 
poliitic into existence.
As to the permanence of the 
body politic, Locke says “The 
power that every individual gave 
to society when he entered it can 
never revert to the individuals 
again, as long as society lasts, but 
will always remain in the commu­
nity.”
Natural law shows that govern-

So as I said at the first—I’m a sentimentalist. I like be­
ing one too! And if it is only for my sake and the sake of 
others like me (and I prefer to think we are legion) I would 
like to see a few more films like these two. (I haven’t en­
joyed myself so much since Disney animated my real hero 
Peter Pan.)

With Axelrad

ment is necessary to protect the 
individual, it derives its power 
from the governed, and it is per­
manent.
The next question is how do 
people enter into this agreement 
to form a body politic? American 
political theory nas long accepted 
the idea of the social compact. 
That is, the ultimate source of 
power is in the people, acting 
through the instrument of a con­
stitutional convention to create a 
constitutional document. The con­
stitutional document is a social 
compact. One of the earliest such 
documents in American history is 
the Mayflower Compact. It reads, 
in part, “We, whose names are 
underwritten, ... do by these 
Presents . . . covenant and com­
bine ourselves together into a civil 
Gody Politick for our better Ord­
ering and Preservation.”
The constitution of the United 
States is also a social compact. It, 
too, derives its power directly 
from the people. Viz., ‘‘We the 
People of the United States . . . 
do ordain and establish this con­
stitution for the United States of 
America.”
And, even the "obsolete” con­
stitution of Pennsylvania is a so­
cial compact, deriving its power 
from the people. The important 
point is that these documents are 
social compacts. Government en­
tered into by social compact is 
government demanded from be­
low, not government imposed 
from above. The states are not 
agent of the federal government, 
they do not derive their power 
from the federal government. 
Similarly, the federal government 
is not the agent of the states, and
"Before I start my lecture, class. I'd like to say a 
few words about pre-week-end cutting."
it does not derive its power from 
the states. The state governments 
and the federal government are 
independent entities.
Thus, according to natural law 
theory and social compact theory 
were created to meet different 
problems. Each is supreme in its 
own sphere. Thomas Jefferson, in 
his first Inaugural Address main­
tained that the states are the 
“most competent administration 
for our domestic concerns . .
What Jefferson did was ac­
knowledge the need for local con­
trol over local matters. The ques­
tion then is not, as Mr. Axelrad 
seems to think, the obsolesence of 
the states, but rather the defini­
tion of a local matter. The ques­
tion of what constitutes a local 
matter is not an easy one, but 
over the years certain guide lines 
have evolved. The administration 
of common law justice is a matter 
of concern — common law doesn’t 
very much from state to state. On
the other hand the question of 
justice under constitutional law is 
a matter of federal concern. 
Chartering of corporations is a 
matter of local concern — most 
corporations confine their opera­
tions to one state. On the other 
hand many interstate operations 
of large corporations are matters 
of federal concern. Regulation of 
local utilities — water, electric, 
local transit — is a matter of local 
concern. Regulation of interstate 
utilities — railroads, airlines — is 
a matter of federal concern. As 
questions of this sort arise, our 
legal system will decide them.
The states do not have duties to 
perform. The fact that some states 
feel a psychological need to re- 
decide the constitutional questions 
answered by the civil war should 
not obscure the fact that there 
are some fields where local con­
trol is a necessity.

Goldmait’s Remark
Dear Mr. Goldman:
You seem to have neglected 
two points: 1) the fact that John 
Locke stated something does not 
necessarily make it right, and 2) 
I do not advocate the abolition of 
local (city, county, etc.) rights, 
only states’ rights.

Faculty Cars Take 
Too Much Space
Editor, The Tartan:
Once again Carnegie has had a 
building dedication, and once 
again the commuting student has 
suffered a gross injustice at the 
hands of the administration. Let 
me make it clear now that I feel 
greatly indebted to the persons 
and foundations who have given 
so much to our school. I would 
gladly walk here from Home­
stead to give up my parking space 
to any of these people. However 
I feel no indebtedness whatsoever 
to the visiting “dignitaries” that 
infest the campus on the occa­
sion of each dedication. The park­
ing problem at Tech becomes 
more acute each year. The privi­
leged section of the Skibo lot is 
a disgrace. If the faculty cannot 
be here at 8:00 a.m. they deserve 
to walk. But the way the ad­
ministration, in blatant disregard 
of the students, usurps all of the 
Frew Street parking spaces and 
much of the Skibo student sec­
tion is more than disgraceful.
Last Wednesday for the Scaife 
dedication an entire block of the 
Skibo lot was roped off. Through­
out the dedication ceremony but 
one car used this section. Frew 
Street, which was reserved for 
two days (one for “cleaning”, 
was not used to much better ad­
vantage.
Now the administration wants
to know why few students at-'**- 
tended the ceremony. For my 
part I did not attend and will con­
tinue to ignore such observance as 
long as the administration con­
tinues to treat me and indeed all 
students like so much mud to be 
trod upon. We ai'e frequently told 
that as students we pay only one- 
half the cost of our education 
here. I think that the administra-p 
tion would do well to remember i 
that we do pay that all-important 
half.

In Welch Hall Is 
Campaign Unfair?
Editor, The Tartan:
An election was held in Welch 
Hall on October 16 for dormitory 
officials. During the elections, the 
person who handed out and col­
lected ballots actively campaigned 
at the same time for one of the 
candidates. This is unfair and 
illegal when done by anyone. The 
seriousness of this particiular of­
fense is compounded, however, by 
the fact that the person who ille- V 
gaily campaigned is Henry Hen­
derson. Mr. Henderson is a coun­
selor of Welch Hall and is also 
President of the Dormitory Coun­
cil. He has flagrantly misused the 
authority that was given to him. 
Many of the residents of Welch 
Hall feel that he is unfit to hold 
the positions he now fills.

Henry P. Henderson Justifies 
Welch Dorm Council Election
[Letters continued from page 6] 
Editor, the Tartan:
Reference has been made to my 
conducting an illegal election to 
®termine the president of one of 
the various domitory units. This 
reference was made by one who 
does not know, nor has taken the 
time to find out, that none of my
actions contradicted any stated 
laws or regulations of dormitory 
government. Indeed, in the Con­
stitution of the Men’s Dormitory 
¡Council, (Art. Ill, Sec. 10-Rules 
Governing Elections of Dormitory 
Officers) very little is stated 
about election procedure except
that it shall be the duty of the 
counselors to “procure, distribute, 
and collect” election ballots.
I do not believe that Mr. Seff 
makes these charges as a reaction 
to his sound defeat in the elec­
tion. He has the right to consider 
my actions unjust or unfair—but 
not illegal. He should not, how­
ever, be the sole individual to 
judge my ethics. Men’s Dormi­
tory Council has the stated func­
tion of considering election pro­
cedure and rendering elections 
void. During the evening of the 
election, I suggested to Mr. Seff 
that he submit his complaint to
the Council so that it might be 
cleared up as soon as possible.
| There Was a perfectly good 
chance that the Council would see 
things his way as opposed to 
mine, and that a new election 
would be ordered. Mr. Seff has 
not chosen to do this, I believe, 
because his preoccupation is not 
with the election itself, but is 
with me and my fitness as an 
elected officer.
This matter concerns itself with 
my campaigning on behalf of Mr. 
Seff’s opponent both before and 
during the time that I was hand­
ing out and collecting ballots. I
believe that I was doing no wrong 
in offering my opinion of the best 
candidate until the very last bal­
lot had been cast. Actually, many 
residents, just before balloting, 
asked which candidate I would 
best be able to work with on the 
Council. I told them. No resident 
was forced to vote in any particu­
lar manner, and the results are 
the true opinion of Welch Hall 
residents. To me, they indicate 
that the best man has won.

Our future is in the hands of men not yet hired
At Western Electric we play a vital role in 
helping meet the complex needs of America’s 
vast communications networks. And a career 
at Western Electric, the manufacturing arm of 
the nation-wide Bell Telephone System, offers 
young men the exciting opportunity to help us 
meet these important needs.
Today, Western Electric equipment reduces 
thousands of miles to fractions of seconds. Even 
so, we know that our present communications 
systems will be inadequate tomorrow; and we 
are seeking ways to keep up with—and antici­
pate—the future. For instance, right now 
Western Electric engineers are working on 
various phases of solar cell manufacture, 
miniaturization, data transmission, futuristic 
telephones, electronic central offices, and 
computer-controlled production lines—to name 
just a few.
To perfect the work now in progress and 
launch many new communications products, 
projects, procedures, and processes not yet in 
the mind of man — we need quality-minded
engineers. If you feel that you can meet our 
standards, consider the opportunities offered 
by working with our company. In a few short 
years, you will be Western Electric.
Challenging •ppertuniti«« exist now at Western 
Electric for electrical, mechanical, industrial, and chemi­
cal engineers, as well as physical science, liberal arts, 
ond business majors. AH qualified applicants will re­
ceive careful consideration for employment without 
regard to race, creed, color or national origin. For mere 
information about Western Electric, write College Rela­
tions, Western Electric Company, Room 6206, 222

Mr. Harth Now Heading 
Tecli’s Music Department
by Marty Siegel
Mr. Sidney Harth, the newly- 
appointed head of Carnegie Tech’s 
music department, brings to his 
position at Tech a wealth of ex­
perience in many phases of music. 
Mr. Harth has won international 
acclaim for his virtuosity as a 
violinist as well as his other acti­
vities in the world of music.
Mr. Harth has studied with 
Joseph Knitzer in Cleveland and 
in New York with Georges Enes- 
co. He is a veteran of three coast- 
to-coast tours and concert tours in 
France, Algeria, Switzerland, 
Germany, and Austria, as well as 
an extremely successful tour of 
Russia in 1961. In 1948 he won 
the Naumberg award and in 1957 
placed second in Poland’s Wieni- 
awski violin competition. He was 
the first American ever to place in 
this competition, the majority of 
w'hose judges were affiliated with 
Communist countries. Prior to his 
coming to Tech, Mr. Harth filled 
the position of concert master with 
the Chicago Symphony.
Among the innovations that Mr. 
Harth has already begun to put 
into progress in the Tech music 
department is a faculty string 
quartet which will play formally 
throughout Pittsburgh. The mem-
| bers of this quartet will include 
Mr. Harth himself and his wife, 
Teresa. There will be a new fac­
ulty and guest concert series, in­
cluding eight evening recitals, to 
I be given at Carnegie Lecture Hall 
at the Carnegie Institute. Mr. 
Harth has also initiated a College 
Community Orchestra, open to 
ex-professionals and qualified 
amateurs. This orchestra will per­
form at Carnegie Hall five times 
! in the coming year.

Readers Write (Continued)
Writer Refutes VS 
Cubanlntervention
[Letters continued from page 7] 
Editor, The Tartan:
On October 10, the Tartan car­
ried an editorial by Stephen o' 
Miller entitled “New Outlook, 90 
Miles & Farther” which advo­
cated an offensive militant cam­
paign against Communism. Mr. 
Miller self-righteously assumes 
that it is our right to “strangle 
Cuba economically” with a block­
ade, and to use similarly force­
ful measure with other commun­
ist governments around the globe. 
First, it should be pointed out to 
Mr. Miller that a great reason 
for America’s unpopularity in the 
world is caused by our efforts to 
force other countries to follow 
our dictates. By blockading Cuba, 
we would in effect be making an 
open threat to Latin America to 
follow policies favorable to us. 
Indeed, when Chile soon elects a 
communist president in a demo­
cratic election, will the U.S. be 
justified in intervening to re­
establish the former government? 
Secondly, by asking for a vigor­
ous militant foreign policy, Mr. 
Miller is advocating an intensi­
fication of the cold war and the 
elimination of any chance for an 
agreement to ban the use of nu­
clear weapons and to achieve dis-
armament. We are not living in 
the nineteenth century where we 
can get our way through force 
and violence. The stakes are too 
high. By advocating a holy war 
against Communism, Mr. Miller 
is committing himself to a policy 
which will inevitably lead to a 
thermonuclear war, a war in 
which everyone stands to lose. 
Mr. Miller may think it right to 
gamble with the lives of the peo­
ple of the world, but I have more 
of a sense of responsibility to 
mankind.

Kosofsky Says 
Not An All-Star
Editor, The Tartan:
May I take this opportunity to 
state that, contrary to recent ar­
ticles that have appeared on your 
sports pages, I was not elected to 
the All-Star IM football team 
last year. Returning All-Stars for 
the Grad Eagles are QB Bob 
Murphy and defensive halfback 
Joe Lees.
I would also like to. urge all 
faculty and students to attend 
the Grad Eagles vs. All-Star Team 
football game, Friday, Oct. 26 
at 2:30 p.m. in the bowl. It prom­
ises to be a very axciting exhibi­

...for a life 
of pride and purpose
Among the young people being graduated from college in these times, there are some who think and leel—perhaps a little more deeply than the others—about the world we live in, the future we face. They ask, “How can I make my career 
CARNNE meaningful? GICA than just personally rewarding?”
And many of today’s most successful young people are finding a fulfilling answer to these questions as officers on the Aerospace Team... the United States Air Force. They can tell you that no career could better combine the oppor­tunity for achievement—and the deep inner
satisfaction of knowing that they are helping preserve the very future of America.
How can you become an Air Force Officer?
If you are a college senior and not currently enrolled in ROTC, Air Force Officer Training School provides an opportunity to qualify for a wide variety of career fields. The graduate of this three-month course receives a commission as a second lieutenant. As the Air Force continues its technological advance, officers with college training will move into positions of increasing importance.
For full information—including the opportunity to earn graduate degrees at Air Force expense —see the Air Force Selection Team when it visits your college, visit your local Air Force Recruiting Office, or write: Air Force Officer Career Information, Dept. SC210, Box 805, New York 1, New York.

Q.BQ,
Krall Opens in “La Boheme” 
Initiates Pgli. Opera Season
Freshmen Beauties Introduced to Tech Men
The Pittsburgh Opera named 
Metropolitan Opera star Heidi 
Krall to replace Elaine Malbin in 
the role of “Mimi” in its sea­
son opening production of “La 
Boheme,” October 25 and 27 at 
Syria Mosque.
Richard Karp, general director, 
said that Miss Malbin asked to 
be released from her contract to 
accept an extended tour in the 
musical “Carnival,” which will 
play the Warner Theater, Erie, 
on October 29.
He acceded to the request on 
learning of the availability of 
Miss Krall. Her appearance in 
“La Boheme” will mark her Pitts­
burgh Opero debut. Thus, the op­
era season opening will feature 
the debuts here of two top Met 
stars—Miss Krall and Flaviano 
Labo.
It was as a replacement that 
Miss Krall got her first big break 
in the operatic world.
A chorus member of the origi­
nal cast of “Oklahoma,” she had 
' been singing with a number of 
j small opera companies in 1953 
when she got a chance to replace 
a contestant in the Metropolitan 
Opera Auditions of the Air.
She impressed the judges and 
went on to win a prized Metro-
I politan Opera contract in the fi- 
! nals. Her greatest triumph came 
j in 1957 when, singing with the 
State Opera in Berlin, she re-
I ceived one of the greatest ova- 
j tions of the season. She has since 
been a smash hit wherever she 
has appeared, including appear­
ances as “Mimi” in “La Boheme” 
at the Metropolitan—the same
i role she will sing here.
In addition to her operatic 
work. Miss Krall has had nu- 
| merous radio, TV. and concert en­
gagements, mast recently as fea- 1
! tured vocalist on the “Firestone ;iI Hour on October 7.
Big Masculine, Delicious Hunks 
Journey Where The Girls Are

Y-IKC Musical Society Presents 
One Of Few Solo Concert Series
If you’re the average Tech stu­
dent you have time for just one 
extra-curricular activity. Why not 
make it girls? Picture yourself 
surrounded by beautiful brunettes, 
sexy blondes, and cuddly red­
heads. Oh daddy, what a picture, 
eh? In order to make this dream 
come true, let’s analyze our ob­
jective. If we knew what girls 
liked, we should be able to locate 
a place where they would flock.' 
In choosing such a place, we must 
take into consideration that girls 
like such things as boys — that is 
big, masculine, delicious, capable 
hunks of rip-roaring manhood;, 
clothes that accent her interesting 
silhouette; cozy atmospheres; ex-1
otic taste treats; affection, soft and 
sweet; going places and doing 
things; showing off individuality.
Now where can le-femme fatale 
satisfy all these cravings? At a 
football game? No. At a track 
meet? No. Around the pool table? 
No. At the movies? Perhaps. At a 
stock car race? Perhaps. In the li­
brary? Perhaps. And then again 
walking in the park has its merits 
too. But the place of all places
— where is that? Could it be the 
SKI SLOPE? Why I do believe we 
found it — the ski slope, of 
course. Well, bye now. I have to 
make a quick exit up stage and 
call MU. 3-5496 to join the ski 
club.
Again, as every year for the last 
37 years, Pittsburgh’s oldest musi­
cal society and one of the few re­
maining solo concert series in the 
entire country, will bring to Pitts­
burgh, nine rnusical evenings.
Returned by popular demand as 
the season opener will be Rosalyn 
Tureck, universally acclaimed as 
the greatest Bach pianist of our 
time. She will appear on Wednes­
day evening. October 24, to lead- 
off the season.
Devoted primarily to introduc­
ing stellar musicians new to Pitts­
burgh in solo and chamber group 
recitals, the Y-IKC Musical So­
ciety has acquired a continuing 
enthusiastic reception. Most of the 
performers which they have intro­
duced comprise the Who’s Who in 
music today.
Among those introduced through 
the Y-IKC Musical Society are: 
Horowitz, Milstein, Segovia, Ser- 
kin, Rubinstein, and Marian An­
derson.
Entirely new to Pittsburgh^ but 
not unknown to the world of 
music is Louis Danto, a tenor, “in 
the Gigli and Schipa tradition,” 
who will make his Pittsburgh 
premiere recital on Wednesday 
evening, November 14.
Wednesday evening, December 5 
will see the American premiere of 
the Polish violinist, Wanda Wil- 
komirska.
Three artists, Leonid Hambro,
I New York Philharmonics’ great 
: young American pianist, heard in 
' Pittsburgh with Victor Borge; 
Robert Mann, first violinist of the 
' Guilliard Quartet, and Lucy 
! Rowan, narrator, will appear both
I in solo, duet and trio music as
1 the Lyric Trio on Wednesday eve­
ning, January 9, 1963.
On January 30. John Corley will 
perform and on February 6, pian­
ist Rudolf Seckin will give his 
first solo recital in Pittsburgh 
since 1936. The Israeli singer,
Netania Davrath, premieres on 
Wednesday evening, February 
27, 1963.
The “Herman and Dolores Pas- 
samaneck Auditions Winner,** 
which is sponsored by the Musical 
Society, selects the best concert 
soloist in the tri-state area is this 
year a young basso, Julius Kuku- 
ragya. Mr. Kukuragya will appear 
on Wednesday evening, March 20,
1963.
Wednesday evening, March 20, 
will also see the premiere Pitts­
burgh appearance of the 16-year- 
old celloist, Michael Flaksman.
Herman Godes, world-renowned 
piano virtuoso, will make his 
premiere Pittsburgh appearance 
at the ninth and final concert of 
the season on Wednesday evening, 
April 3. 1963.
Special rates for full time stu­
dents at any schooi, college or 
university are available at only

Pres. Warner Addresses 
Engineer Symposium
The engineering student of to­
day who has become a sussess- 
ful engineer in 1980 may have 
Jf some surprising suggestions for 
engineering education as he looks 
back on his own firmal educa­
tion in 1962.
In a speech delivered at the 
Engineering Symposium in con­
junction with the dedication of 
the new engineering building at 
the University of Alabama on Oc­
tober 11, Dr. J. C. Warner gave a 
- few predictions of what the stu­
dent’s reaction might be. In his 
talk entitled “Looking Backward 
in 1980 to Engineering Educa­
tion Today,” he put himself in 
the place of the engineer and 
analyzed some strengths and 
weaknesses of engineering educa­
tion in 1962.
“Let’s imagine,” said Dr. War- 
\^' ner, “that an engineer in the 
high achiever group in 1980 is 
taking a look backward at the 
formal education provided him 
15-20 years before and is at­
tempting to evalute it from the 
standpoint of how well it served 
him as a base for his career.”
He would be glad, according to 
the Carnegie Tech president, that 
his education included time for 
1 ' a solid, effective core of studies
in the humanities and the social 
sciences. He would be especially 
pleased to recall the teachers who 
fostered his interest in literature, 
history, economics, and psychol­
ogy, the areas in which he has 
found reading pleasure.
“To those who would still con­
tend that no more curriculum 
time could be devoted to the hu- 
v manities and social sciences,” Dr.
* Warner continued, “our high
achiever would reply that we 
should drop the pretense that the 
B.S. degree is a first professional 
degree in engineering. He would 
advise that the Bachelor’s de­
gree and that the Master’s degree 
or perhaps even the Doctor’s de­
gree should be the degree-admit­
ting one to the engineering pro­
fession.”
^ This student would be pleased 
that the emphasis in the better 
engineering colleges was being 
placed on preparing the student 
for the “long pull” rather than 
“here and now.” He is glad that 
the need for continuing educa­
tion on his part after graduation 
was impressed on him by his 
teachers, and he is also happy that 
he was given the fundamental 
principles of physical and engi- 
> neering science to prepare him 
^ for problem-solving.
However, the successful engi­
neer of 1980 would probably have 
some gripes about his education 
too. “He would very likely say 
that it would have been very 
helpful to him if his formal edu­
cation had served to liberate him 
more completely from three di­
mensions—so he c o u 1 d think 
about problems too complex (i.e. 
too many variables) to be repre­
sented by a physical model. I’m 
sure he would advocate,” con­
tinued the Carnegie Tech presi­
dent, “giving the students a bet­
ter understanding than he had 
been given of modern mathemat­
ics and the way it can be used 
as 'a language for the concise 
statement of problems—and of 
those modern mathematical meth­
ods which are helpful in the so- 
£ lution of complex problems.”
“I believe he would say that 
he should have been taught more 
about modern methods of com­
putation—about what computers 
can do for engineers—and about 
what one must tell computers if 
they are to find answers to en­
gineering problems.” His reason 
for suggesting these improve­
ments, according to Dr. Warner, would be that he has had to mas-
•
ter these things by self-educa­
tion or by taking evening or other 
special courses in order to keep 
abreast of the most efficient and 
effective engineering practices.
I’m sure that our engineer in 
1980 will be making very ex­
tensive use of computers in the 
design of machinery, equipment, 
processes, and structures, and in 
the control if processes. We be­
lieve that he will be living and 
working in an era in which there 
will be in general use, with the 
aid of computers, what might be 
called a science of engineering 
judgment, just as we have al­
ready seen the evolution, with the 
aid of computers, of a science of 
management or administra­
tion which, in certain areas at 
least, permits more adequate de­
cision making than could be ob­
tained by relying in business 
judgment.
“Our crystal ball is sometimes 
a bit cloudy,” concluded Dr. War­
ner, “but I believe that all of us 
who have been giving much 
thought to how we can best edu­
cate engineers for the long pull 
would give odds that by 1980 the 
engineer in doing his professional 
work will need the background 
I have indicated.”
State Library 
Now Accepts 
25 Trainees
The Pennsylvania State Li­
brary is accepting applications 
now for library trainees who will 
enter graduate school in the fall 
of 1963.
Up to twenty-five trainees can 
be selected on a competitive basis 
each year. Trainees receive ap­
proximately $4,120 to defray tui­
tion and living expenses for the 
year they are attending graduate 
school.
To be eligible for selection, a 
candidate must hold a college de­
gree, be accepted by an accredited 
library school, and meet require­
ments for employment set by the 
State Library. Selection is based 
on a written examination, inter­
view by a selection committee, 
and evaluation of undergraduate 
record.
Following graduation from li­
brary school, a trainee must work 
for about two years, or twice the 
length of his schooling, in a 
Pennsylvania public library.
Additional information on the 
traineeship program is available 
from the Library Development 
Division, State Library, Box 
1601, Harrisburg. Colleges and 
universities will also be visited 
by library career consultants 
during the year.
Prof. Leland Hazard Comments 
On American National Goals
Dean Swank (left) and Dr. Joseph (right) are shown 
talking to Prof. Hazard.
Americans are noted for the 
viewpoint “The difficult we do 
right away, the impossible takes 
a little longer.**
In the October 16 Assembly, 
Professor Leland Hazard eon- 
demed this attitude in his speech 
“Our National Goals—Will We 
Make the Hard Choices Among 
Them?”
Mr. Hazard, Professor ofGSIA, 
received his A.B. from the Uni­
versity of Missouri. He also at­
tended William Jewel College, 
Harvard Law School and the Uni­
versity of Cihcago before coming 
to Tech. His articles on economics,
unions, and management have 
been published in several nation­
al magazines. Mr. Hazard feels 
that we must realize that we can 
only fulfill a few goals. If we try 
to do everything, nothing will be 
well done. He gave seven choices 
of goals and explained which 
were his. Some of these choices 
were more hospitals or more lit­
tle theaters, more cars or more 
beautiful urbanization, and con­
tinued working or forced retire­
ment at 65 with Social Security.
Professir Hazard’s thought-pro­
voking ideas gave the audience an 
insight into the increasing prob­
lem of chosing our National Goals.

Hawaii U Announces 
Grad Scholarship Plan
The East-West Center at the 
University of Hawaii is offering 
American graduate students 100 
scholarships. Established by the 
U.S. Congress in 1960, the center 
seeks to promote mutual under­
standing by bringing together 
students from Asia, the Pacific 
area, and the United States for 
study, interchange of ideas and 
shared living experiences.
The grants are ordinarily for 
21 months and include travel to 
and from Hawaii, tuition, books, 
food and lodging, health insur­
ance, and a small personal allow­
ance. An unusual feature of the 
scholarship is a grant to study 
in Asia given to qualified candi­
dates enabling them to complete 
thesis research in the field and 
study language.
Candidates for scholarships 
must commit themselves to a ma­
jor concentration in some asject 
of an Asian-Pacific culture, in­
cluding the language. Their con­
tinuance as a Center grantee de­
pends on successful performance 
in the language and area achieve­
ment, excellent health, ability to 
relate to Asians, and interest in 
contributing to the objectives of 
the Center.
M.A. in Asian Studies is offered 
for study in an advanced langu- 
age-and-area program in one of 
the cultures of East, Southeast 
and South Asia, with a major in 
one department. A Ph. D. degree 
is offered in History of East Asia 
or Pacific Islands, Anthropology, 
Political Science, and Philosophy. 
Students may also elect a two- 
year M.A. degree program in 
Overseas Operations to prepare 
for service in Asia with interna­
tional organizations, agencies of 
government, or private institu­
tions and industries.
Applications f o r East - West 
Center scholarships and addition­
al information may be obtained 
by writing: The Admissions Di­
rector, East-West Center, Univer­
sity of Hawaii, Honolulu 14, Ha 
waii. The application deadline for 
the 1963-64 academic year is Feb.
1, 1963. Additional information is 
available in the TARTAN office.
Panhel Holds “Meet Sororities Tea 
Explains November 11-16 Rush
Sorority rush will be held from November 11 to 16.
During the past weeks, cryptic 
signs have appeared all over 
campus with two words on them
— “Sorority Rush.”
“Rush where?” Confused girls 
have been asking as they tear 
through butterflies and calendars, 
trying to find dates, places, and 
time. Finally on October 20, 1962, 
all freshmen and upperclass wom­
en who were interested in sorori­
ties had the opportunity to 
find all vital information concern­
ing rush, which begins in less 
than a month. Refreshments and 
entertainment were provided at 
the “Meet the Sororities Tea” 
between 2:00 and 4:00 P.M. in the 
Recreation Room in Morewood 
Gardens. The seven sororities and 
Panhellenic Council were rep­
resented with elaborate displays 
set up by each group. All inter­
ested individuals were urged to 
“rush” to the “Meet the Sorori­
ties Tea” and find out what this 
mysterious subject is all about. 
Questions concerning rush and 
sororities were not only wel­
comed, but answered in detail by 
Mrs. Milligan, Dean of Women, 
and the Panhellenic Officers.
Center students have a choice 
of more than 200 courses in Asian 
Studies in 18 department of the 
University of Hawaii. Asian lan­
guages are: Japanese, Chinese,
Korean, Indonesian, Javanese, 
Thai, Hindi, and Sanskrit. The
The majority of the scholar­
ships are available in Asian 
Studies, Overseas Operations, 
East-West Philosophy, Interna­
tional Relations, and Compara­
tive Government. A limited num­
ber of scholarships is available in 
the fields of Asian Music, Drama 
and Theater, Art and Geography; 
Pacific Island Studies; Asian and 
Pacic History; Community De­
velopment, Race Relations, An­
thropology, and other fields.

Tartans Smash Into Win Column, 
Defeat Franklin-Marshall, 14-12
by John Blue
Tartans to cross the goal line.
Playing under NCAA rules, 
F&M could try a kick for a single 
extra point, or could try a run or 
pass for two points and a tie score. 
The Diplomats elected to go for 
the two and sent fullback Johnson 
into the line. The Tartans repuls­
ed the attempt, and the score 
stood 14-12.
TD Called Back 
Tech took the kickoff and gain­
ed three first downs to eat up 
time. The clock ran out with Tech 
on the F&M 30. Actually, Tech 
scored a third touchdown on this 
drive, but the 38 yard run of 
Smith was called back because of 
an offside penalty.
The long scoring drought ended 
last Saturday as the Tartan foot­
ball team scored twice in the sec­
ond half and then withstood a 
fourth quarter attack by Franklin 
and Marshall to win 14-12.
The win brought the Tartan’s 
record to 1-4 and thus assured 
them of at least tying the mark 
set last year, 1-7. F&M saw their 
non-winning streak continue to
0-4.
Tech was again playing without 
the services of senior end Larry 
Arrendas. In addition, halfback 
Furman Smith was still bothered 
with the slight shoulder separa­
tion sucered two weeks ago in 
practice.
Same Old Story 
Tech kicked off to open the 
game, and it looked like the same 
story as last week. The Diplomats 
took the ball and marched to the 
Tartan’s 40 yard line. At this point 
the defense became organized and 
forced F&M to punt.
The ball rolled dead on the 
Tech 2, and after trying three run­
ning plays in moving the ball to 
safer ground, Tech returned the 
punt. The Diplomats took the ball 
on the Tech 37 yard line and 
scored in 9 plays. Fullback Dick 
Johnson carried for the touch­
down from the three yard line. 
Key plays in the series were a 
five yard run by F&M’s leading 
groundgainer Mike Reese on a 
fourth down and five situation, 
and an eight yard pass from 
Quarterback Craig Loupassakis on 
a fourth and six situation.
Kick Blocked 
On the extra point try, sopho­
more end Dave D’Appolonia 
crashed through to brock the kick. 
This later proved to be one of 
the key defensive plays for Tech 
in the game.
The rest of the first half proved 
to be nothing but frustration for 
both teams. Late in the second 
half, Tech did pick up a first 
down, their first in the game.
The Tech offense came to life in 
the second half as A1 Abels re­
turned the second half kickoff to 
the Tartan 35. From this point, 
Tech scored in 16 plays. Only one 
pass was thrown, and this was 
completed to D’Appolomnia on the 
F&M five. Four plays later, fresh­
man fullback Smokey Merrill 
plowed in from the one. “Whiz” : 
Wisniewski converted to put Tech 
ahead, 7-6.
Defense Shines 
Tech kicked off and had to give 
ground to their own 35. Here, 
Dave D’Appolonia provided an­
other sterling defensive play as he 
intercepted a Diplomat screen j 
pass and returned it 11 yards to 
the 46.
Tech missed a first down by 
Inches at the F&M 44 and had to 
yield the ball. The Diplomats re- j 
turned the ball immediately via 
a fumble by fullback Tom Ander­
son which was covered by Bechtel 
at midfield.
Tech Scores Clincher 
After Bechtel gained two to the 
48, Hechler hit D’Appolonia at the
37 with a pass which was good for 
a first down. A1 Abels rambled to 
the 25 for another first. Two run­
ning plays gained little, and Hech­
ler resorted to the air, hitting D’­
Appolonia at the 12. From here, 
Furman Smith sk?’ted left end for 
the touchdown. Wisniewski con­
verted to make the score 14-6.
The TD by Tech served to 
arouse the Diplomats. Reese took 
the kickoff on his goal line and 
returned to the 40. Four running 
plays put the ball on the Tech 
15, where Reese tucked in a Lou­
passakis pass and dodged several
This coming Saturday, Tech
