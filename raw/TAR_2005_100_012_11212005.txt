Enrollment officials hold dinner
to discuss rising
by Matthew McKee
Stafjwriter
Last Wednesday, faculty, staff, students, 
and parents spoke together about the many 
tuition bills that will flood mailboxes next 
fall. Other than an intermission for dinner, 
University officials had a lot to say about 
why tuition was rising.
This year, students had to put together 
$31,650 for tuition alone, and at this meet­
ing, officials explained why that figure will 
continue to rise. The Office of Enrollment 
facilitated this Undergraduate Tuition 
Meeting to address the concern whether 
increases are commensurate with this strik­
ing figure, and they encouraged partici­
pants to give feedback on the issue. After 
hearing the presentations and processing
tuition costs
the numbers, participants indicated that 
while the number still continues to climb, 
their concern started falling.
Nine students, ranging from first-years 
to juniors, attended the meeting. Other at­
tendees included 26 parents, and assorted 
faculty and staff such as Joseph Devine, as­
sociate dean of the College of Humanities 
and Social Sciences, and Jim Hoburg, a 
professor of electrical and computer engi­
neering. Melissa Taranto, an analyst from 
CMU Institutional Research and Analy­
sis, began the presentation by explaining 
CMU’s ranking according to the U.S. News 
and World Report. Her presentation broke 
down the many statistics that determined 
CMU’s 22nd rank among 246 national uni­
versities, and showed how the University

“Do they even do anything?”
A recent lack of Senate visibility has led some stu­
dents such us first-year economics major Dan Aduna to 
wonder what Student Senate does, why it exists, and 
whom it benefits.
The Tartan looked into the policies of student gov- 
.emments at local and national peer universities to 
see how CMU’s own government fared. Compared to 
other universities, communication problems between 
student government and the students themselves seem 
particularly prevalent at CMU. However, other schools 
were found to have crippling problems with allocating 
student funds. Furthermore, other universities give 
salaries to student government officers and student
CMU’s Student Senate is composed of 36 senators 
elected by their respective colleges, with each senator 
representing about 140 students. The Senate itself is

On Wednesday, Governor Ed Rendell called 
for state initiatives to create “green” energy.
by Shawn Wertz
Junior Stafjwriter
Only hours after signing a repeal of a con­
troversial congressional pay raise, Pennsyl­
vania Governor Ed Rendell visited Carnegie 
Mellon last Wednesday to speak to the cam­
pus community on his plans for turning 
Pennsylvania into a “greener” state.
“The reason I chose Carnegie Mellon 
is because of the great work of the Stein- 
brenner Institute in its efforts to make the 
campus more environmentally friendly,” 
commented Rendell. However, CMU is not 
the only intended stop. “We plan on going 
to places throughout the state,” he said, “to 
give the same presentation we gave in Har­
risburg on our plan for alternative energy.”
The Steinbrenner Institute for Environ­
mental Education and Research, or- SEER, 
has been leading the initiative for environ­
mentally friendly practices on campus since 
1990. Recent SEER projects include the pur­
chasing of wind energy to power five per­
cent of campus facilities, the construction 
of New House as the first green student dor­
mitory in the country, and, most recently, 
the installation of a living roof on top of 
Hamerschlag Hall.
SEER endorsed the governor’s presenta­
tion on Wednesday because he stressed the 
importance of green practices. “As oil con­
sumption increases, we need to find ways 
to be independent of that diminishable sup­
ply,” Rendell said.
The governor’s new energy portfolio 
calls for an increase of 18 percent in the 
amount of alternative energy the state uses.

CIT hosts a successful first annual Clippership cruise event
by Steven Spurgeon
Stafjwriter
Breakdancing first-years, deans “get­
ting down,” and a free iPod were all on 
the menu for the first-ever CIT Fresh­
man Cruise, held November 11.
The night began with over 100 stu­
dents stepping onto buses bound for the 
river area. There the group stopped to 
pose for a picture, then boarded a Gate­
way Clippership. Once aboard, students 
were treated to a meal and music, after
which they slowly made their way to the 
dance floor.
While the group seemed fairly re­
served at the beginning of the evening, 
things soon started to warm up and the 
dance floor filled quickly. Dean Kurt 
Larsen himself got inti» the spirit of 
things after being coaxed by students. 
“I hope my dancing wasn’t too much an 
embarrassment,” he said afterward.
Not all those attending chose to 
dance. Small groups sprung up all over 
the ship, as students decided to reiax and 
chat rather than work out on the dance
floor. In spite of the chilly weather, a 
few brave students even ventured above 
deck to watch the lit Pittsburgh skyline 
as they glided by.
When asked why he wanted to come 
on the cruise, Nate 'Barkinfind, a first- 
year in thé biomedical engineering de­
partment, said that he just “wanted to 
relax.”
Other students asked had similar 
feelings, and one electrical and chemi­
cal engineering student, Sam Hashemi, 
even decided to sleep on deck, though 
he soon complained about the cold. “I
was tired, but after a while the cold got 
to me,” he said.
The highlight of the evening came 
when Larsen prepared to raffle off an 
iPod Nano and several gift certificates. 
Before the raffle, the administrators in 
attendance passed out long-awaited 
class shirts emblazoned with “Carnegie 
Mellon Engineering” and “Class of’09.”
As Larsen began the giveaway, he 
thanked students for attending and 
wished them luck in their future

Special to The Tartan
The Waterfront Loews Cineplex, a popu­
lar place for CMU students to catch movies 
and popcorn on the weekend, was the scene 
of a fatal shooting last Wednesday night af­
ter the premiere of the film Get Rich or Die 
Tryin’. In response, Loews has decided to 
stop showings of the movie until the police 
have finished their investigation.
The shooting’s victim, Shelton Flowers, 
was from Wilkinsburg and had a criminal 
record, as well as a gun of his own at the 
theater. For now, several uniformed officers 
have been deployed at the theatre to ensure 
safety.
West Homestead police do not believe 
the film incited the violence. “This was not 
a random act,” said West Homestead police 
acting Sgt. Dan Kinzel. “Whenever you get 
a large group of people in a certain place, 
there’s going to be incidents.”
Curtis “50 Cent” Jackson, the rapper 
whose life Get Rich or Die Tryin’ depicts, 
echoed that view on ABC’s The View. He ex­
pressed his condolences but dismissed a link 
between his movie and the shooting, saying, 
“This was a 30-year-old man [who] had a 
dispute with three other guys.”
However, Anthony Butts, a professor of 
creative writing and English at CMU, re­
mains wary of rappers as role models. “I 
grew up in a ‘50 Cent’ neighborhood in De­
troit, like the one in the movie Four Brothers. 
There was a way to get out of the ghetto, but 
studying wasn’t cherished. The best way to 
get out is through entertainment. However, 
not everyone can be famous — but everyone 
can get an education.”
Butts said, “There’s a kind of violence 
endorsed by American culture that is perva­
sive in sports, news, etc. I don’t blame the 
media, because it shows us what they think 
we want to see.”

/ Bradford L. Yankiver
I received an e-mail on October 17 
that asked, “What will the Carnegie 
Mellon tuition be for 2006-2007?” 
The e-mail was an invitation to the 
2006-2007 Undergraduate Tuition 
Meeting from Bill Elliott, CMU’s 
Vice-President for Enrollment. “The 
trustees will make the final decision 
on the 2006-2007 tuition rate, but the 
recommendation made by President 
Cohon is critical. We need your help 
in formulating this recommendation,” 
it read. I was honored to have been in­
vited.
But the meeting turned out to resem­
ble something more like a sales pitch 
than a discussion group, and the only 
means of giving feedback was to make 
a high-pressure, off-the-cuff speech be­
fore all of the guests. The event was not 
what I had expected.
The dinner guests entered and 
mingled as they found their assigned 
tables. Elliott opened the meeting with 
a brief overview of the agenda: Fifteen 
minutes to explain CMU’s U.S. News 
ranking; 10 minutes on tuition changes 
of the past 10 years; 40 minutes for a 
pep talk about the spectacular initia­
tives and efficiency of the University; 
and 15 minutes on the University’s fi­
nancial woes, which concluded with 
the announcement that tuition is fore­
casted to rise five to seven percent for 
students next year.
After the barrage of information, my 
thoughts were muddled. My table’s 
dinner discussion wandered. After the 
allotted 35 minutes for dinner, Elliott 
called on each table to send a repre­
sentative to address the room. I got the 
sense that most of the speakers were in­
timidated by the situation — I certainly 
was. A couple of witty one-liners light­
ened the mood, but I got a very clear 
impression that this was not the place 
for expressing criticism or concern.
Elliott and the other administrators 
didn’t seem to need our help at all. On 
the whole, it felt more like an indoctri­
nation than a discussion.
Over the past decade, Carnegie 
Mellon University’s tuition has grown 
far more rapidly than the cost of living 
in Pittsburgh — sometimes drastically 
more.
In 1999, when the tuition jumped a 
whopping 11.3 percent, Cohon said the 
increase had the purpose of increasing 
revenue. At last week’s meeting, the 
best sense I got about the rationale for 
the next tuition hike was that it will 
be needed to offset rising health-care 
costs — though faculty and staff will 
be seeing drastic increases in their own 
contributions — and utilities such as 
fossil fuels.
But this explanation seems simplis­
tic. There is another interesting factor.
Universities have to play a strange 
game as they set tuitions. A university 
doesn’t want to be too expensive, but 
some administrators think it is even 
worse to be too cheap. The theory is 
that cost indicates quality, especially 
to wealthy parents who foot the bill 
for their children’s higher education. 
The result is a race to be in the upper 
middle of the pack.
The minutes from the May 12,1999, 
Faculty Senate meeting state, “Bill El­
liott showed a comparison chart of tier- 
one institutions.... Tuition comparisons 
were noted. CMU’s was low in compar­
ison [to the other institutions].”
Looking at where our tuition levels 
fall today, CMU has steadily made its 
way to upper-middle range. Mission 
accomplished?
Frankly, I have confidence in CMU’s 
administrators — our University is 
world-renowned for its ability to create 
and implement strategic plans — and I 
won’t say I have an exceptional under­
standing of tuition pricing.
When asked to contribute to the 
discussion, I was thrilled to be a part 
of the process. But last week’s dinner 
was little more than a song and dance, 
and from what I understand, last year’s 
tuition meeting attendees voiced the 
same sentiment. If Elliott wants to rally 
the troops, that’s fine, but he should 
not try to pass off pep rallies as focus 
groups.

Fourth installment of campus-wide nuclear awareness survey
Answers to last week’s nuclear poll
by Erik Sorenson
Special to The Tartan
Carnegie Mellon students 
seem to be familiar with U.S. 
history. Over half of the stu­
dents responding to last week’s 
poll recalled correctly that the 
United States’ justification for 
the bombings , of Hiroshima 
and Nagasaki was to. force 
Japan’s surrender and save both 
American and Japanese soldiers’ 
lives. However, students were in­
decisive when they were asked 
to pick out quotations from the 
United States’ current stance on 
nuclear weapons. The responses 
make it clear that students are 
more familiar with our nation’s 
past than our nation’s present.
The clearest perspective as to 
why the U.S. dropped the atomic 
bomb is found in President 
Truman’s statement issued to 
Americans after the bombing of 
Hiroshima. In that declaration, 
Truman stated, “It was to spare 
the Japanese people from utter 
destruction that the ultimatum 
of July 26 was issued at Potsdam. 
Their leaders promptly rejected 
that ultimatum. If they do not 
now accept our terms they may 
expect a rain of ruin from the air, 
the like of which has never been 
seen on this earth.”
Truman explicitly declared 
that nothing short of uncon­
ditional surrender would do. 
In other speeches and letters, 
Truman also expressed his de­
sire to save as many American 
lives as possible. From Truman’s 
perspective, it appears that his 
decision was that of utility and 
he did what was necessary to 
bring to an end one of the most 
gruesome wars this world has 
ever seen.
However, history forces us to 
look back and examine Truman’s 
altruistic motives. In his state­
ment, Truman declares, “The 
Japanese began the war from the 
air at Pearl Harbor. They have 
been repaid manyfold. And the 
end is not yet.” This and other 
statements issued by Truman 
have fueled the theory that 
the bombings of Japan were 
meant to retaliate against 
the Japanese attack on Pearl 
Harbor.
Another theory claims that 
the U.S. wanted Japan to sur­
render before the USSR became 
involved. The reasoning is that 
the U.S. did not want the Soviets 
to influence postwar Asia as they 
would postwar Eastern Europe. 
The first bomb was dropped 
two days before the USSR de­
clared war against Japan. In his 
August 1985 article “Leaving the 
Bomb Project” in the Bulletin 
of the Atomic Scientists, Joseph 
Rotblat claimed he overheard 
General Leslie Groves, head of
the Manhattan Project, state 
that the “real purpose in mak­
ing the bomb was to subdue the 
Soviets.” However, Rotblat was 
unsure of Groves’ exact meaning 
because at the time the U.S. and 
the USSR were allies.
Rotblat eventually abandoned 
the Manhattan Project, the only 
scientist to do so. He did so at 
the end of 1944, when it became 
clear the Germans had aban­
doned their bomb project.
Unfortunately, it appears as 
though all actual accounts of 
why the bombs were dropped 
have been recorded, leaving 
historians with little left to un­
cover. We may never be sure of 
the exact reason or reasons. All 
we know for certain is that the 
atomic bomb was created and 
used. Truman described the cre­
ation of the bomb as “the great­
est achievement of organized 
science in history.” Now we are 
left to deal with it.

Forum discusses students’ rights

Weeks after the drafting of 
a proposed amendment to the 
Students’ Rights Policy, debate 
over the amendment still lingers. 
Last Friday, the Academic Affairs 
Committee held a forum on the 
proposed amendment in the Dan- 
forth Lounge of the University 
Center.
The atmosphere among the 
12 students in attendance was 
friendly, and members of the Ac­
ademic Affairs Committee were 
not at all disheartened by the 
low turnout. When asked why 
the forum had not been more 
widely publicized, Michael Bueti, 
vice-chair of the Academic Affairs 
Committee, said that as an or­
ganization, the Academic Affairs 
Committee does not heavily pub­
licize its events and “it should be 
every student’s responsibility to 
be aware of the Students’ Rights 
Policy.”
The proposed amendment is 
largely based on wording from 
conservative activist David 
Horowitz’s Student Bill of Rights, 
and reads: “The third right of 
students is to be evaluated based 
on reasoned answers following 
stated course criteria and appro­
priate knowledge of the subjects 
and disciplines they study, not on 
the basis of their personal beliefs.” 
According to the Chronicle of
Higher Education, Horowitz, who 
created an organization called 
Students for Academic Freedom 
(SAF), travels the country’s uni­
versities and colleges aiming to 
bring a balance of political views 
to the classroom.
Long Pham, chair of the Aca­
demic Affairs Committee, said the 
goal of the forum was to make the 
amendment process “as open and 
transparent as possible” and to 
get “better ideas about where we 
should be taking [the policy].” He 
did not believe the lack of public-
ity would undermine the forum’s 
goals, adding, “We want to find 
out if students are happy.”
The forum turned into some­
thing very similar to what Pham, 
a senior business administration 
and history major, envisioned. 
Discussion included topics rang­
ing from the importance of pre­
cise language to the confusion 
surrounding the amendment’s 
purpose.

Weekly Nuclear Awareness Poll
by Erik Sorenson
Special to The Tartan
Soon after the development 
of nuclear weapons, the interna­
tional community realized that 
if it did not obstruct the devel­
opment of these weapons, they 
would inevitably fall into the 
wrong hands. After several failed 
efforts to limit nuclear prolifera­
tion, the international commu­
nity finally agreed to a treaty, the 
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), 
that would strive to eliminate 
the threat of nuclear weapons to 
global security. The NPT entered 
into force in 1970 and outlined 
the roles of nuclear and non­
nuclear powers. Nuclear-armed 
nations promised to pursue “mea­
sures relating ... to nuclear disar­
mament.” Non-nucleai- nations, 
while able to reap the benefits of 
the peaceful aspects of nuclear
technology, promised not to pur­
sue the development of weapons.
Though the NPT has been mar­
ginally successful in preventing 
the spread of nuclear weapons, 
nations seeking to covertly de­
velop weapons capabilities con­
stantly challenge its goals. As a 
signatory of the NPT, the U.S. 
must weigh the checks and bal­
ances of its security against its re­
sponsibilities as an armed nation 
when developing its policies.

Brian Orr, this year’s Black Aware­
ness Committee Chair, said, “We 
really just wanted to do something 
in the fall to increase membership 
and also to give the incoming fresh­
men something to immediately be a 
part of.”
This year’s theme was “Montage.” 
According to SPIRIT’S president, Ro­
man Ivey, SPIRIT’s goal has been 
to get everyone involved, including 
alumni, the CMU community, and its 
organizations. “We wanted a more 
united front,” Orr added.
The Black Awareness Committee of 
SPIRIT continued to use the first week 
as a model and met regularly for two 
months to plan the events. However, 
Ivey said, “We try to do new things. 
We try to be a little more ambitious 
with our programs.”
With the help of Student Activities 
and the Carnegie Mellon Advising Re­
source Center (CMARC), the commit­
tee was able to fill each night with a 
unique event.
The week started with an opening 
celebration in which black faculty 
spoke to students about their passions 
and classes they were planning on 
teaching. Some events throughout the 
week included showing and discussing 
Higher Learning, a film on the racial 
and gender issues involved in higher 
education; an Alumni meet-and-greet; 
a community service event; and a per­
formance by BridgeSpotters, a spoken 
word group.
Beyond preparing for SPIRIT week, 
the Black Awareness Committee has 
other projects in line. They are also 
active in organizing events for Martin 
Luther King, Jr., Day and Black His­
tory Month. Ivey explained that this 
year they plan to work with the Black 
Graduate Association, the Black Busi­
ness Association, the National Soci­
ety of Black Engineers, the Minority 
Association of Pre-Health Students 
(MAPS), and CMARC to come out 
with a stronger and richer program 
for the appreciation and celebration 
of black culture.
Upon reflection, Orr was happy 
with SPIRIT Week’s events and the 
people they were able to involve. 
“Each night [got] a different crowd, 
which is good. It helps show the dif­
ferent facets of our organization,” Orr 
said.
food vouchers for 15 meals in resi­
dence halls, and a $600-per-month 
check for 12 months — an overall 
salary of $25,888.95.
At Berkeley, the executive office 
of the student government is given 
a stipend to distribute to its officers 
at its own discretion. Currently, ex­
ecutive officers are making $4000 
per year each, while student sena­
tors are unpaid.
Student compensation is also a 
relevant issue at Point Park, where 
an editorial by Helfrich said a new 
proposal by the Point Park student 
government would pay the student 
government president an annual 
stipend of $1000 in addition to free * 
room and board.
“To put that into perspective 
and assuming that the president 
worked a 40-hour week, his com­
pensatory wage is from $7.02 to 
$8.43 an hour.... Why isn’t the [stu­
dent government] thinking of uses 
for $20,000 that would benefit the 
student body and not just them?” 
Helfrich asked.
According to Michael Koretsky, 
advisor of the University Press, Flor­
ida Atlantic University’s student 
newspaper, “The UWC [University- 
Wide Council] has its own budget, 
and last year, members secretly 
gave themselves a retroactive 25- 
percent pay raise.” Fifteen members 
of the student government received 
such raises, and the student body 
president herself received a pay in­
crease from $10,200 to $12,750 a 
year, stated an article in the Palm 
Beach Post.
Though first-year CMU Student 
Senator Eric Osheroff acknowledges 
that receiving a stipend would be 
nice, he said, “Pay would com­
pletely falsify the idea of service. 
The [CMU] Senate should always 
remain completely volunteer.”
Members of the student govern­
ment also expect the campus com­
munity to volunteer their opinions 
and concerns. In regards to interac­
tion between student government 
and the student body, Pham noted 
that the burden of communication 
is not just the responsibility of Sen­
ate, but other students as well.
“Student Senate meetings are 
open to all students,” said Pham, 
“and students have the ability to 
contact Senators in their colleges at 
any time.”

supposed to fund all student groups 
and executive offices,” said Kagan. 
Instead, he said, Senate members 
distributed to their favorite campus 
groups or to those run by friends.
“The university had to hire out­
side advisors to help moderate the 
spending,” Kagan said.
Improper fund maintenance can 
be especially damaging to students, 
depending on how much money 
their government controls. Accord­
ing to Jesse Helfrich, editor-in-chief 
of the Point Park Globe and a cur­
rent Point Park junior, 11 percent of 
Point Park’s student activities fee is 
distributed at the discretion of the 
student government.
In Helfrich’s opinion, the Point 
Park University student government 
“exists more as a social club than a 
legislative body. It is ridiculous to be 
pushing money at [an organization 
like Student Senate] that doesn’t do 
anything for the school or the stu­
dents.”
' As of 2000 at Case Western Re­
serve University, “[the Undergradu­
ate Student Government’s] total 
annual budget is approximately 
$120,000. Over $100,000 is dis­
pensed to over 90 student organiza­
tions. The rest consists of [USG’s] 
internal budget,” stated former 
vice-president of finance James 
Chang in a survey conducted by the 
American Student Government As­
sociation from 1997 to 2003.
Nick Scocozzo, CMU’s current 
student body Vice-President for Fi­
nance, says that CMU is unique in 
that 100 percent of student activities 
money is distributed at the discre­
tion of the student government. Ac­
cording to Scocozzo, this responsi­
bility has not been abused in recent 
years. “From my stance, we haven’t 
run into anything,” he said.
Salaries
In addition to funding alloca­
tion among campus organizations, 
universities also face the issue of 
payment for student government 
members. CMU’s student senators 
do not receive any compensation, 
but senators at many other univer­
sities do. The highest-paid student 
government position as of 2003 was 
Northeastern University’s student 
body president, who receives tu­
ition for eight credits per semester,

engineering and public policy major 
and a former senator, acknowledges 
that many students remain unaware 
of Student Senate’s effects on cam­
pus. “The reality of the system is 
that not many students actually feel 
the need to take their concerns to 
the Senate,” she said. “There aren’t 
many changes that can be made. In 
actuality, [Student Senate] is better 
at delaying negative changes from 
happening. Sometimes students 
aren’t asked their opinions before 
the administration creates policies. 
[Senate] really just wants to keep 
the channels of communication 
open.”
Some of these channels aren’t 
properly maintained, however. 
“The Student Senate website is not 
always kept up to date, and the 
newsletter it started a few years ago 
did not take off,” Birchak added.
Recently, the Senate worked to 
develop a media rights policy, de­
lay the implementation of printing 
quotas, and get students’ input be­
fore minors were taken off diplomas 
this year. Birchak said most of the 
complaints she heard while in office 
dealt with dining, in particular the 
development of the block plan.
Funding
One of the Senate’s most impor­
tant duties is allocating funds to 
campus student organizations. The 
CMU Joint Funding Committee 
gives the Senate an annual operat­
ing budget of $1.25 million, which 
the Senate allocates annually to dif­
ferent student organizations.
In contrast, Birchak said, the Uni­
versity of Chicago’s Student Senate 
gets a lump sum of $500,000 to dis­
tribute to student organizations by 
request. An organization can return 
to their Student Senate each time 
they want more money during the 
year.
Not all student governments 
have demonstrated proper fiscal 
responsibility. Noah Kagan, a 2005 
graduate and former Student Sena­
tor of the University of California at 
Berkeley, said that lack of discretion 
in distributing money caused Berke­
ley’s student government to go into 
debt five years ago. Ideally, “the stu­
dent government [at Berkeley] was

Safety questioned at Waterfront
SECURITY, from A3
Police in Syracuse and Ari­
zona do think that the movie is 
linked to violence. Sgt. Shane 
McFarland of the Arizona 
Department of Public Safety 
is quoted by the Pittsburgh 
Tribune-Review as saying: “His­
tory has traditionally shown 
that when this type of movie 
opens nationwide, it attracts in­
dividuals who are into gangster 
rap.”
That may be the reason why 
the theater at the Waterfront 
hired an off-duty copy for extra 
security. Viacom Inc.’s Para­
mount Pictures, which is dis­
tributing Get Rich or Die Tryin’, 
also paid for extra security at 
movie theaters. This was not 
unprecedented, as extra secu­
rity has been deployed in the 
past, according to the Tribune- 
Review.
The film was rated by the 
MPAA “R for strong violence, 
pervasive language, drug con­
tent, sexuality, and nudity.” 
Terence Winter, who wrote epi­
sodes of HBO’s graphic series 
The Sopranos, wrote the script. 
Lisa Schwarzbaum of Entertain­
ment Weekly wrote, “It is also, 
surely, the first movie I’ve ever 
seen that incorporates graphic 
prison violence (complete with 
an Oz-like naked brawl among 
showering inmates) ... and un­
relenting raw language.”
The film also has a robbery 
scene that culminates in the 
real-life attempt to kill 50 Cent, 
who was shot nine times but 
lived.
After the shooting at Loews, 
many people are worried about 
how safe the Waterfront is. Until 
now there had never been as 
serious a crime as a fatal shoot­
ing at the Waterfront. Kinzell 
stressed that crime around the 
Waterfront has “never been 
homegrown.” Flowers, he men­
tioned, was from Wilkinsburg, 
not West Homestead.
Carol Tatrai, secretary of the
borough of West Homestead, 
feels that West Homestead is 
secure. “There are parts of the 
surrounding area that aren’t the 
most _ desirable, but there are 
some very nice neighborhoods. 
The police are very much on top 
of things.”
Tatrai and Lisa Guckes, the 
tax collector for West Home­
stead, both believe that the 
Waterfront development has 
been a boon for the borough, 
which gets tax revenue from the 
Waterfront. However, the de­
velopment has a tax increment 
financing (TIF) program until 
2015, which means they won’t 
pay full taxes until then.
Guckes said, “We had noth­
ing there before except for a 
shut-down steel mill. Now we 
have jobs and development. It 
[the TIF] is the only way to get 
a development this big to come. 
It’s more beneficial to the busi­
nesses at first, but later we’ll get 
the full taxes. It was a win-win 
situation.”
Students discuss new 
rights amendment
FORUM, from A3
Senate’s Communications 
Committee chair, responded to 
the growing concern over the 
amendment’s intention by say­
ing, “The way I see it, it would 
make the existing policy clearer 
and more concise.” Those sit­
ting next to Hamilton, a junior 
in humanities and arts, as well 
as philosophy, murmured in 
agreement.
Student senators present, 
however, were open to the 
constructive criticism given to 
them by their peers. Concerns 
brought up focused on the 
amendment’s wording, rather 
than its intent. By the forum’s 
end, students held a general 
consensus that the amendment 
was a positive idea, but the lan­
guage of the amendment’s last 
clause needed a more careful 
revision.
As it stands now, University 
policy outlines a detailed ap­
peals process that provides stu­
dents with many avenues to ap­
peal a grade they deem as un­
fair. Bueti, a junior majoring in 
physics, said, “The intention of 
the amendment is to make stu­
dents aware that these policies 
exist” by centralizing them.
As early as next month on De­
cember 6, Pham and the other 
members of the Academic Af­
fairs Committee plan on taking 
the amendment to the Faculty 
Senate — the next step in the 
process of making it academic 
policy. Both Bueti and Pham 
believe Carnegie Mellon Uni­
versity faculty will welcome the 
potential addition to University 
Policy.
“We’re past the first hurdle,” 
Bueti said.
No faculty participated in 
Friday’s forum.

Students and parents discuss tuition
TUITION, from A1
compared with peer institutions.
According to the presentation, 
alumni donations play a factor in 
the ranking. Taranto said that of 
CMU’s alumni, 26 percent have 
contributed money to their school. 
The University ranks 31st in this 
category.
Another category considers ed­
ucational expenses. CMU spends 
on average about $50,000 per full 
time student every year, ranking 
24th among peer institutions.
After that, William Elliott, the 
Vice-President for Enrollment, 
talked about CMU’s tuition rate in 
comparison with other universi­
ties. Elliott said that CMU’s average 
tuition rate comes out just above 
the national average of $31,525. 
Further, he said tuition has risen 
for the past 11 years. However, one 
graph Elliott presented showed
that for eight of the past 11 years, 
CMU’s tuition has risen in lower 
percentages than the tuition of its 
peer institutions.
When all the costs are totaled 
this year, CMU’s price tag falls at 
$40,960. The average cost of at­
tending what Elliott called “com­
petitor schools” such as Cornell 
University, Northwestern Univer­
sity, and University of Pennsylva­
nia is $41,046.
Even with this, Elliott said, “Our 
aspirations are bigger than our 
checkbook.”
Provost Mark Kamiet then pre­
sented CMU’s many achievements. 
“We’re really not 22nd,” Kamiet 
said. “... That’s not how we think 
of ourselves. We pick areas to ex­
cel in... and all of our departments 
are in the top 15.”'
Kamiet called CMU a “scrappy 
success story” because the Uni­
versity came into its own only a
few decades ago, and has now 
achieved nationwide recogni­
tion for improving its capacity to 
affect undergraduate students. 
Continuing, Kamiet said that CMU 
only has an endowment of about 
$837.5 million compared to the 
average endowment of its com­
petitors of $409.6 million. Kamiet 
pointed out that in terms of finan­
cial efficiency, CMU comes out at 
the top.
Even with this expert efficiency, 
undergraduate tuition will still 
rise five to seven percent next fall.
In feedback presentations, 
representatives from each table 
spoke about the increases. Over­
all, participants in the discussions 
approved of the increase. With all 
those areas in which CMU aims to 
improve, and all those in which 
the school already excels, the con­
sensus was that the numbers make 
sense.

and joked that he himself had won, 
before going on to call out the actual 
winner.
At the end of the evening three 
students walked away with new 
gifts, but all left in good spirits. 
When asked if the cruise would be 
offered again next year, Larsen re­
marked, “I think this year’s cruise 
was a big hit, so I’d be happy to do it 
again if that’s what they want.”
Asked what could be done to im­
prove next year’s event, Larsen said, 
“I would like to increase student 
participation to include as much of 
the entire class as possible. These 
sort of activities can help contribute 
to a sense of community, which is an 
important component of the college 
experience.... It’s an opportunity 
[for administrators] to get to know 
the students better.”
“Plus,” he added, “where else are 
you gonna see me get up and ‘move

21 November 2005 , THE TARTAN A6
Physics Day: Celebrating 
100 years of Einstein
by Christine deBriffault
Layout Staff
Try to imagine a universe in 
which Einstein never existed. 
Chances are, we would not com­
prehend a micron of what we 
do today. 2005 marks the 100th 
anniversary of three seminal 
publications by Albert Einstein, 
outlining his theories of spe­
cial relativity, light quanta, and 
Brownian motion. To celebrate 
the occasion, Carnegie Mellon’s 
Physics Student Advisory Coun­
cil held the first Physics Day last 
Friday.
The celebration began with a 
presentation by Professor Rich­
ard Holman on his research 
in quantum mechanics, field
theory, and inflationary cosmol­
ogies. According to inflation, an 
early universe expanded rapidly, 
then settled into the expansion 
rates a la the standard Big Bang 
model. “Each universe after in­
flation is flat,” Holman said, and 
ours is very nearly the same. 
During inflation, multiple sub­
divisions may arise within one 
universe, dividing it into huge

StudyLoft.com: Online homework help
by Sean Conroy
Staffwriter
You’re paying Carnegie Mellon 
$40,000 a year for high-quality 
education. If you’re as yet unsat­
isfied with the results, there’s a 
new place to exchange money 
for knowledge: www.studyloft. 
com.
Starting at 30 cents per min­
ute, StudyLoft will pair you up 
with a tutor for an enhanced 
chat session, replete with vir­
tual chalkboard. But don’t get 
too excited just yet; StudyLoft’s 
tutors have only been at the job 
a few months, and The Tartan’s 
initial test run showed they can 
only handle introductory-level 
questions.
StudyLoft is the creation of 
Bikram Roy, an entrepreneur 
who has “always been keeping
an eye out for successful busi­
ness opportunities.” Roy recalled 
having to “run around campus 
looking for help and staying up 
all night” doing homework. He 
realized that college students 
might be willing to pay for tu­
toring that caters specifically to 
their immediate needs.
College students are not look­
ing for long-winded lectures on 
general subject matter. They 
want specific answers to home­
work problems, usually the night 
before they are due. Fortunately, 
this is exactly where StudyLoft 
excels. StudyLoft is most heavily 
staffed between 8 pm and 4 am, 
its peak hours. Peak hours are 
also when services are cheapest.
StudyLoft claims to offer tu­
toring for “all levels of math, sta­
tistics, accounting, economics, 
chemistry, physics, and biology.” 
Such claims require above-aver­
age tutors, and Roy confirmed 
that “all our tutors have at mini­
mum a bachelor’s degree, and 
most of them actually have a 
masters. We have at least one 
Ph.D. per subject.”
The Tartan decided to take 
advantage of one of the free trial 
sessions. At 1:55 am on Friday, 
The Tartan signed up for a free 
15-minute tutoring session. The 
Tartan requested a physics tu­
tor, and at 2:00 am, we logged 
in. The interface was like IM on 
steroids, with a blackboard and 
Mathematica software attached 
to the chat space. The tutor’s 
name was Sam, and he was 
logged in and waiting.
The Tartan knows a thing or 
two about physics, so we de­
cided to ask “Sam” an obscure

How Things Work: Rainbows
Hanadie Yousef
It’s a beautiful sunny morn­
ing after a long night of rain. 
You look out your window, and 
there before your eyes is a rain­
bow! As you stare in awe, you 
desperately look for its end, to 
find that lucky pot of gold. But 
while you stare at nature’s bril­
liant spectacle, there’s no need 
to wonder how rain and sun 
can align to put color in the sky. 
You’re about to find out.
The fundamental process at 
work in a rainbow is refraction, 
the “bending” of light. Light 
bends, changing directions 
when it travels from one me­
dium to another. This happens 
because light travels at differ­
ent speeds in different medi­
ums. We see rainbows partly 
because light travels faster in 
air than it does in water.
To understand why light 
bends, imagine you’re roller 
-skating at constant speed 
across a concrete parking lot. 
Your speed depends on the me­
dium you are traveling over — 
the paved surface of the lot. If 
you change the medium you’re 
traveling through (by roller
skating straight onto a grassy 
area, for example), you’ll slow 
down. The grass medium of­
fers more resistance, so it takes 
more energy to move on the 
roller skates.
When you skate onto the 
grass at an angle, something 
else happens. If your right skate 
hits the grass first, it slows. Your 
left skate, still on the pave­
ment, is going faster than your 
right skate and you veer to the 
right. Moving through different 
media causes you to change di­
rection.
Just like your skates, a beam 
of light turns when it enters 
a glass prism. The light is re­
fracted at the boundary be­
tween the air and the glass. 
(Some of the light actually 
reflects off the prism surface, 
but most passes through.) The 
light bends again when it exits 
the prism.
If the glass bends the light 
twice, as in a prism, you can see 
the separated colors more easily. 
This color dispersion in a prism 
occurs because of the refractive 
index of the glass. Every ma­
terial has a different refractive 
index: when white light travel­
ing tnrougn tne an enters tne 
side of a prism, the difference 
between the refractive indices 
of air and glass causes the light 
to bend. The angle that light 
bends varies between different 
wavelengths. As the white light 
moves through the two faces of 
the prism, the different colors 
that make up white light refract 
at different angles — and in
doing so spread out into a vis­
ible spectrum of colors.
In a rainbow, raindrops in 
the air act like tiny prisms. 
White sunlight enters the rain­
drop, bends due to a change 
in medium, and exits from the 
raindrop back into air, bending 
again. In the process, it is bro­
ken into the component colors 
— red, orange, yellow, green,
blue, indigo, and violet — and 
we see a rainbow.
If each raindrop gives a rain­
bow of colors, why do we see 
bands of color in the sky, as if 
different areas were dispersing 
a different color? Your eyes see 
different colors based on where 
the raindrop is in the sky. Each 
color has a different wave­
length, and each wavelength 
is reflected from raindrops at 
a different angle. Depending 
on the location of the raindrop, 
only certain wavelengths are at 
the proper height to reach your 
eye. As the raindrop gets lower 
in the sky, the angle necessary 
to reach your eye decreases, 
and you see different bands of 
color in the sky: a rainbow.
Each rainbow forms a cir­
cle of color in the sky; there’s 
never an end. Therefore, you 
can never find that lucky pot 
of gold; sorry to crush your 
hopes!
And that’s all there is to rain­
bows. Light and water combine 
in just the right way to paint a 
beautiful natural picture. The 
next time you spot a rainbow, 
you will see it in a whole new 
light.

Scientists find gene 
for fear in the brain
Scientists have found a fear 
gene in the brain that could lead 
to new treatments for mental 
disorders such as post-traumatic 
stress and anxiety. The gene, 
known as stathmin or oncoprotein 
18, is highly concentrated in the 
amygdala, the region of the brain 
linked with fear and anxiety. “This 
is a major advance in the field of 
learning and memory that will 
allow for a better understanding 
of post- traumatic stress disorder, 
phobias, borderline personality

At the Joint POW/MIA Ac­

Hot Dry Rocks a new 
source of energy
Australian companies are look­
ing to use “hot dry rocks,” which 
can reach temperatures above 300 
degrees Celsius, as a source of 
green energy. Hot-rock energy can 
supply more power at a cheaper 
price than wind or solar energy. 
Five kilometers below the earth, a 
layer of granite creates an insulat­
ing layer that traps heat from the 
earth’s core. To convert the heat 
to electrical energy, highly pres­
surized water is pumped down 
through the rocks to widen exist­
ing fractures; then the heated wa­
ter is transferred to a geothermal 
power station where it produces 
steam and electricity.

Jeannette Wing gives keynote address for NCWIT meeting
tational thinking commonplace,” Wing said. She also spoke about the number of women in technology and how to 
increase that number, citing supportive teacher and peer communities as effective ways to achieve her vision.
by Radha Chitale
Science and Technology Editor
Last week, Carnegie Mellon 
hosted a meeting for the National 
Center for Women and Infor­
mation Technology (NCWIT). 
Attendees were treated to an 
energetic keynote address from 
Jeannette Wing, head of CMU’s 
Computer Science department. 
Wing spoke about the depart­
ment’s history, challenges, and 
how to implement changes that 
support women in technical fields 
by following CMU’s examples of 
outreach and education.
Wing emphasized how inter­
disciplinary and pervasive CS is 
on CMU’s campus. The depart­
ment’s broad vision of the field 
encompasses many other depart­
ments, including biology, philos­
ophy, engineering, robotics, and 
drama. “Every department wants 
a piece of us,” Wing said.
Founded 40 years ago, the CS 
department began as a graduate 
program but has since grown to 
include a bachelors degree. Prior 
to 1999, the number of female 
undergraduates rang in at seven 
percent. That number grew over 
the years, peaking in 2000 when 
the number of female undergrad­
uates was 39 percent.
Obviously, the gender gap was 
a concern for the department. 
The Margolis-Fisher study, done 
by two CS professors at CMU in 
1998, proposed that there are 
fundamental gender differences 
with respect to computer science 
application. In addition, they 
said that creating a community 
of undergraduate women was an 
unsuccessful support strategy.
Wing outlined what the CS de­
partment did in order to get a di­
verse selection of CS candidates 
in the door. First, the depart­
ment changed their admissions 
criteria, explicitly stating that no 
prior programming experience
was necessary. The second 
change was to look for leaders 
within the applicant pool. In 
this way, the department main­
tained their standards while in­
creasing the diversity of admit­
ted students.
While getting students in the 
door was the first step, Wing 
noted that the job was not over; 
the department also had to 
concentrate on getting students 
out the door. “We have a real 
commitment to success,” Wing 
said. To this end, the depart­
ment made an effort to provide 
lots of support for all students 
to reach the proficiency level of 
the core 200-level courses.
Another key initiative was 
to create a strong sense of 
community in the form of 
Women@SCS, a group that 
participates in and hosts phil­
anthropic, professional, and 
social activities.
In response to the Margolis- 
Fisher study, a follow up study 
done in May 2005 by Lenore 
Blum and Carol Frieze, also 
CS faculty at CMU, turned the 
findings upside down. Fol­
lowing the changes in admis­
sions criteria and curriculum, 
the gender differences disap­
peared, and they determined 
that creating a women’s com­
munity, like Women@SCS, had 
a positive effect.
During the question and an­
swer portion of Wing’s keynote, 
Lilian Wu from IBM asked, “Not 
too many CS departments have 
followed what CMU has done 
and adapted it to their insti­
tutions. Why?” To this, Wing 
responded with an emphatic 
“I don’t know!” but went on to 
say: “you have to find that one 
person committed.”
Most importantly, Wing 
charged the men and women 
at the NCWIT to “present CS 
for what it is, [not] dumb it 
down.”

a higher percentage share of the 
world’s supply of coal than Saudi 
Arabia has a share of the world’s 
oil.”
Yet, even with the above fig­
ure, Rendell claims that “there 
are 8529 acres of unreclaimed 
coal refuse piles, including at 
least 258 million tons of waste 
coal, that scar the landscape and 
cause pollution.”
A process called coal gasifica­
tion turns the unwanted coal into 
liquid form, ensuring a cleaner- 
burning energy source. The gov­
ernor said this was a promising 
way to use the waste coal.
Rendell emphasized coal gas­
ification as a primary source 
for alternative energy, add­
ing, “Pennsylvania is building 
the first such refineries in 30 
years.”
These plans were included 
in a bill signed on July 13 titled 
“Growing Greener II.” The gov­
ernor intends for his plans to be 
carried out within six years of 
the bill’s signing.
Until then, Rendell plans to 
continue sharing his portfolio for 
a more environmentally friendly 
energy standard in different 
locations across the state.

Students from all disciplines 
attended last week’s events. Kris­
topher Alan Borer, a senior me­

Physics Day: “Physics Day was

Thomas Fitzgerald Newcomer, 
a senior creative writing major,

One hundred years later, physi­

As Einstein said: “The important 
thing is not to stop questioning. 
Curiosity has its own reason for

Pornographic ‘Pirates’ aren’t debatable
Blatant advertising is the only real argument against this year’s showing
Last Tuesday, November 15, Graduate 
Student Assembly (GSA) President Brian 
Fifarek sent an e-mail to the leaders of 
the Activities Board and AB Films de- 
. manding that all advertising for TBA be 
, taken down and that showing pornogra- 
. phy on campus be banned.
But frankly, it shouldn’t be banned. 
Plain and simple: Disallowing pornogra­
phy screening is censorship. Whether or 
not certain members of our community 
want pornography to be publicly screened 
should have no bearing on its status as a 
symbol of freedom of expression.
Fifarek made a critical misstep in 
bringing his personal opinion into his 
argument; although he claimed to speak 
for the GSA executive board, few mem­
bers were ever consulted. Fifarek isn’t 
. the only one to do this, either: It seems 
, that when it comes to TBA, those who 
think themselves morally superior want 
to decide what is best for our students.
¦ But judging from the enormous lines 
outside McConomyon Sunday, the stu­
dent body has already spoken.
The University Policy on controversial 
speakers also rings true in the discussion 
as well. “Freedom of thought and free­
dom of expression cannot be influenced 
by circumstances. They exist only if they 
are inviolable. They are not matters of 
• convenience but of necessity. This is a 
part of the price of freedom.”
Even if pornography is allowed, 
though, there are those on campus 
that argue Student Activities fee money 
should not be used for showing or 
advertising pornography. But before we 
resort to the fallback argument of “My 
student activities fee shouldn’t go to 
activity X,” is Student Activities money 
even being used to fund TBA?
First of all, the ticket revenue exceeds 
the costs of showing the film, so only 
the film-watching students end up pay­
ing for it. Additionally, this year’s film 
rights were not bought with Student 
Activities money, but rather bartered for 
by agreeing to post websites on advertis­
ing posters.
Furthermore, each student pays his 
or her $80 Student Activities fee ei­
ther with the expectation of receiving at 
least $80 worth of benefit from it. One 
student may not benefit from the Asian 
Student Association, but may benefit 
from Scotch ’n’ Soda. Each student uti­
lizes their fee in different ways, making 
a dollar-by-dollar analysis of “where my 
money is going” unrealistic.
Were the funding body-of Student 
Senate to pull money from every mor­
ally debatable activity, you might be 
surprised at what would go missing. 
Last year, for example, there were those 
who argued that the Vagina Monologues 
should not be funded because of its por­
trayal of a young girl in a lesbian sexual 
relationship, which has been criticized 
as glorifying statutory rape.
The biggest issue at hand, is whether 
or not student money should pay for 
such graphic ‘advertisements. It’s true 
that this is the first year the name of the 
movie, as well as suggestive images from 
it, have been advertised in advance. But 
why did it even happen? What happened 
to the posters from last year that were 
intentionally innocuous, solely stating 
“TBA” with the date and times, and no 
indication of content?
While a full-size poster of a busty blond 
in corset may not be in the best of taste, we 
cannot overlook the fact that it’s within 
AB’s rights to advertise their movies as 
they see fit. There’s no policy for this; but 
in the future, it’d be nice if AB could use a 
bit of taste in their judgements.
The bottom line is that while the ad­
vertisement of sexually explicit material 
is something that needs to be reviewed, 
pornography on campus falls under the 
protection of freedom of expression 
and speech. If you aren’t interested in 
watching it, it’s your choice to not pay 
the entrance fee. However, being sub­
jected to tasteless advertisements is not 
within your control, and in the future, 
AB should carefully consider what kind 
of message it will send before it puts up 
posters and flyers for TBA.
Blogger sees that Sony gets served
" On October 31, Windows spyware ex­
pert Mark Russinovich was testing out
¦ the latest version of his RootkitRevealer
¦ program when he noticed something 
.odd: His software found 22 suspicious 
. files, all of which were otherwise com­
pletely invisible to Windows.
Confused as to how his own system 
could have been “infected,” Russinovich 
¦did some sleuthing and eventually traced 
the malicious files to his copy of Van 
Zant’s Get Right With The Man album.
As it turns out, Sony BMG — the pub- ’ 
lisher behind all of this began “pro­
tecting” 52 titles with a technology called 
XCP from the company First4Internet. 
'Over 2 million CDs were shipped with 
a program that would stealthily infect 
.Windows computers into which the 
owner inserted the disc.
Ethics and privacy concerns mount 
quickly: If Sony BMG surreptitiously in­
stalls a program that can tell the com­
pany when and how you listen to your 
-CDs, what comes next?
' It gets even more outrageous: Four 
days later, Sony BMG published a 
“Service Pack,” telling users that the
DRM rootkit software was in no way 
malicious, but offering to remove it any­
way.
The service pack only makes the DRM 
files visible; it doesn’t remove them. 
Even worse, the service pack opens up a 
ton of vulnerabilities in Windows, leav­
ing systems both crippled and open to 
attack.
Three weeks later, with their DRM 
software infecting more than half a mil­
lion computers, Sony BMG has finally 
owned up to their mistake. They’ve 
issued a recall for the XCP-protected 
CDs, offering replacement with CDs that 
have a different protection scheme.
Sadly, though, the company hasn’t 
officially acknowledged they caused 
damage to hundreds of thousands of 
computers. Nor have they issued a no­
tice that their service pack only makes 
the situation worse. One example of 
their inaction is how Sony BMG failed 
to do anything for several days after 
researchers noted how dangerous the 
service pack was.
Rising from this whole episode of being 
oppressed by the man, we see a refresh­
ing and interesting vehicle for change. 
Russinovich merely blogged his findings 
on the relatively obscure sysinternals. 
com. Before long, though, technology 
watchdog Cory Doctorow linked it from 
the popular boingboing.net, and it set 
the wheels in motion.
Wired, NPR, USA Today, and finally 
the New York Times covered the story, 
convincing Sony BMG to temporarily 
suspend its practice of completely ex­
ploiting its customers.
While it would be premature to herald 
this as the turning point in a new age of 
democracy and “power to the people,” 
it is yet another demonstration of the 
Internet’s incredible power. Everybody 
has a voice in this world, and it’s becom­
ing harder and harder for the establish­
ment to silence people who have some­
thing to say.
So, even if large, international con­
glomerates decide to take advantage of 
the little man — and get away with it
— there is still an avenue to fight back 
against the corporate machine and have 
your voice heard. Even if it is via Internet 
blogs.
SayWhat? Failed Responsibility
Joe Arasin
One friend of mine has had her 
four-year schedule and ensuing ca­
reer planned out since freshman year. 
Another is a senior who finally figured 
out what she wanted to do, only to lack 
the preparation to study it in graduate 
school. While I congratulate the first, 
the fact that many more students can 
relate to the second friend accentuates 
one of this University’s fundamental 
failures.
It . is a university’s responsibility to 
provide students with a proper founda­
tion on which they can build the rest of 
their lives. Carnegie Mellon is known 
for providing among the best career 
training in the world. It does not, how­
ever, provide an adequate opportunity 
for students to determine what they 
want to study.
We must question whether concrete 
future plans should be a prerequisite 
to a Carnegie Mellon education. It is 
impossible to expect 18-year-old high 
school seniors to know what they want 
to do with their lives. Yet, Carnegie 
Mellon students are thrust into specific 
courses of study from the time they 
accept their offers of admission. Upon 
arrival on campus, students are pre­
sented with a specific list of coursework 
that must be completed for a degree 
from the college in which they are en­
rolled, a list that becomes the defining 
element of course registration. When 
course registration rolls around, stu­
dents are often too focused on finishing 
degree requirements or studying some­
thing they love.
At this University, there are a multi­
tude of opportunities — disciplines that 
are completely foreign to many high- 
school graduates. An ideal curriculum 
provides students the opportunity to 
pursue varied interests and find a true 
passion. However, flaws in the course 
registration system often make this 
impossible. While I have never had a 
problem enrolling in a course required 
for my major, enrolling in anything else 
often has proved to be a trying task.
For many courses, effectively, all seats 
are reserved for majors in the relevant 
discipline. Over time, I learned that 
registration for these classes is often 
possible by talking to enough professors 
and advisers. This process, however, is 
not clearly defined, and its effectiveness 
varies greatly.
These flaws stem from underlying 
philosophical problems. By dividing 
the institution into separate schools, 
the University defines education in the 
fields of engineering, art, and social 
sciences as fundamentally different. 
Separation of the schools leads to a fo­
cus on career training rather than broad 
education. The University does not feel 
like a complete unit, but rather a hand­
ful of trade schools that fall on the 
same plot of land. Students are defined 
almost entirely by their career aspira­
tions, and there is no middle ground 
provided for questioning.
Dare I suggest that we tear down 
the artificial boundaries separating the 
engineers from the philosophers from 
the actors? An educational institution 
should first provide each student an op­
portunity to explore various disciplines 
and determine what he or she wants to 
study. Later, each student should work 
with an adviser to develop a curriculum 
tailored to the student’s interests and 
aspirations.
I challenge those in charge to al­
ter the structures and policies at this 
University which make possible this 
fundamental failure. Alter the admis­
sions process so 18-year-olds are not 
forced to decide their future careers un­
prepared. Respond to student interest 
by offering additional course sections 
rather than excluding non-majors. Hold 
discussions with students, administra­
tors, and faculty to re-evaluate the over­
all meaning and content of a Carnegie 
Mellon education.
In 1900, Andrew Carnegie founded 
an institution with the motto “My heart 
is in the work.” Over a century later we 
must ensure that in our focus on work, 
we provide students an opportunity to 
find their hearts.
Inverted trees extend the 
prostitution of Christmas
Evan Sundwick
Welcome to the new world order. The 
Christmas season begins in October, 
Thanksgiving is but a warning flare, 
and Christmas trees are no longer the 
conical icons they once were. No, these 
days, the growing hegemony of holiday 
season consumerism has propelled an 
evolution of our time-honored symbol 
of Christmas.
ceiling or wall.
The whole concept of an “inverted 
Christmas tree” ostensibly dates back 
to medieval Europe, where tradition 
often dictated hanging a tree from the 
ceiling. How they managed that in the 
days before duct tape I’ll never know, 
but sources say that was the way things 
were done. This modern resurgence 
of the upside-down tree, however, is 
pretty much universally acknowledged 
to be rooted in retailer attempts to save 
space.
Since the base of the inverted
I’m just not sure what I’d do if I had more 
presents than I could fit under a tree. 
I’d have to have Christmas two days in 
a row just to get everything opened!
Many outlets have begun selling “in­
verted Christmas trees.” These trees 
stand at heights comparable to standard 
trees, with one important difference
— the narrow part is at the bottom, and 
the wide part is at the top. The trees ob­
viously need to have an attached stand 
to make sure they don’t fall over — but 
the good news is since they’re all arti­
ficial, they don’t need to be watered. 
Some trees, in fact, forgo stands and 
instead are meant to be hung from the
Christmas tree is much smaller than 
that of a standard tree, it’s easy for 
them to fit into spaces that normal trees 
would never be able to go. Two or three 
trees can fit on a display floor in some 
big department store with products 
under and between them; this wouldn’t 
be possible with the standard tree. This 
way, we as consumers will have more 
stuff to ogle as we wander through the 
ever-expanding Christmas displays.

HOW tO:
Run for office without
Have yourself a merry 
inverted Christmas
Ben Hackett
In case you have been under 
an apolitical rock for the past 
year, here is a brief synopsis of 
the Democratic platform and the 
media focus for upcoming 2006 
and 2008 election cycles: First, 
Bush is Richard Nixon. Second, 
Iraq is Vietnam. And last, aus­
terely issueless politics have re­
placed the need for compelling 
policy initiatives. After all, no 
need for substance when scandal 
abounds.
Directly addressing the reader 
is not a tactic I habitually use 
in my pieces. However, if any 
readers were disturbed by the 
truths found within the pieces on 
Sheehan, Katrina, or Islamic fun­
damentalism, they might want to 
turn away and huddle with the 
rest of the commune for warmth. 
Today we are going to do a little 
housekeeping and myth-busting 
while we examine the phases of 
running for office without true 
policy initiatives.
Phase 1: Turn the Bush White 
House into the Nixon White 
House. One need only read the 
front page of any newspaper to 
hear cries of “The White House 
is falling! The White House is 
falling!” The recent indictment of 
Lewis “Scooter” Libby for “lying” 
about something that was not a 
crime is the latest example of the 
Bush headhunt that has been go­
ing on since 2000. Even with the 
Libby assassination blown apart 
by recent Bob Woodward com­
ments, the endless attempts at 
defining the Bush White House 
as corrupt continue.
Lest we forget, liberals view 
the 2000 Presidential election as 
a “stolen” election. The headhunt 
began during the campaign and 
broadened after the swearing-in 
ceremonies. There was a brief 
period of feigned civility after 
the 9/11 attacks. These terrorist 
attacks, later described by lib­
eral golden child John Kerry as 
“nuisances,” briefly silenced the 
drumbeat of negativity.
However, it did not take the
liberals long to mount a new of­
fensive on a wartime president. 
Remember Enron? How about 
Abu Ghraib? These “scandals” 
were twisted and contorted into 
White House connections for 
purposes of fitting into the re­
spective period’s media cycle. 
The media party and prominent, 
but irresponsible, liberals have 
attempted to draw parallels be­
tween the Bush White House and 
the Nixon White House.
Phase 2: Turn Iraq into 
Vietnam. As soon as the term 
“quagmire” was unleashed into 
the mainstream vernacular 
through CNN, the focus became 
apparent. Vietnam, arguably 
America’s most unpopular war, 
immediately provokes an emo­
tional response. The network 
media fondly remembers bring­
ing down a war effort through 
mischaracterization and demoni- 
fication of our armed forces. This 
is not to say that Vietnam was 
a well-principled war; rather, it 
was a show of how selective re­
porting can lead to the disinte­
gration of public opinion. This 
unsound comparison of Iraq to 
Vietnam has motivated Vietnam- 
era hippie leftovers back into the 
streets in protest.
Unfortunately for some, 
Vietnam and Iraq are quite dis­
similar. First, by the numbers 
alone, these conflicts aren’t alike. 
Through the first two and a half 
years of committed U.S. troop 
actions in Vietnam, there were 
around 13,000 Americans killed. 
By comparison, 2100 U.S. sol­
diers have been killed in Iraq in 
the same period of time. Iraq has 
also had two severely underre­
ported votes and one extremely 
underreported constitutional 
convention and adoption.
In addition, there are philo­
sophical differences between 
Iraq and Vietnam. In Vietnam the 
United States was engaged in part 
of their containment strategy. 
The U.S. was attempting to con­
tain the spread of Communism, 
but without directly challeng­
ing the Communist giant, the 
Soviet Union. In Iraq, the United 
States is engaging in the ideo­
logical struggle against Islamic 
fundamentalism head-on. The
an agenda
tactics include a military-led 
effort in the spread of democ­
racy and elimination of enemy 
forces within the responsible re­
gion. This is truly where Iraq and 
Vietnam part ways. This is also 
the reasoning that makes the ef­
forts in Iraq clearly more valu­
able to the national interest than 
the efforts in Vietnam.
The Last Phase: Respond to 
a lack of values and palpable 
issues with divisive rhetoric and 
character attacks. With elections 
around the corner, and the par­
ty’s values not clearly defined, 
liberals have turned to the polls 
to find their positions on issues 
of the day. Not surprisingly, this 
has necessitated attacks and 
blind opposition. Imagine if 
Republicans completely vacated 
their original position on an issue 
as central as, say, a war. This fact 
would not be overlooked, and 
conservatives would be forced 
to explain their complete, and 
spineless, reversal.
However, when one applies 
these same principles of logic to 
the other side, the importance of 
accountability seems to subside. 
Lacking policy initiatives such 
as a constitutionally responsible 
judicial branch, Social Security 
reform, or tax code revision, the 
prescribed strategy h^s been 
to run for office on a negative 
agenda. Admittedly, Republicans 
have been off on issues, espe­
cially spending, but at least the 
average American can figure out 
where the party stands.
Our liberal friends? Well...
In response to Tim Russert’s 
question concerning what 
Democrats stand for, Howard 
Dean, the chairman of the 
Democratic National Committee, 
remarked, “We have plenty of 
time to show Americans what 
our agenda is, and we will, long 
before the ’06 elections.” That’s 
right: Who needs a real agenda 
when running on the Hate Bush 
agenda has worked so well?

he draws his next, last, and every 
principled breath.
TREES, from A8
According to most marketing 
pages, another big advantage of 
inverted Christmas trees is that 
it’s a lot easier to decorate with 
ornaments. As if things hadn’t 
gotten absurd enough, with 
people spending a hundred dol­
lars or more on collectible, rare, 
or otherwise expensive trinkets, 
now we have an even more gran­
diose way of showing off our 
material wealth in celebration 
of our great commercial holi­
day. With an inverted tree, or­
naments hang off the branches, 
exposed to all because they 
hang below the foliage they are 
attached to instead of resting 
on top of whatever is beneath, 
as they would on a standard 
Christmas tree.
These inverted Christmas 
trees aren’t real — they require 
no attention, no watchful eye 
making sure they are getting 
enough water and not shedding 
needles like a sick cat sheds fur. 
These trees will last forever, and 
it’s a damn good thing they will; 
inverted trees can cost upwards 
of $600. How does that sound
— $600 for something you’ll 
pull out for a few weeks every 
year? Six hundred dollars that 
you can spend to offer you and 
your family more floor space, an 
easier time hanging ornaments, 
and giving you more room to 
put your already-expensive 
presents under the tree?
Oh, yes, that’s the other 
thing — these upside-down 
Christmas trees are advertised 
as being great for creating 
more room under the tree for 
presents. I, personally, find it 
very reassuring that corporate 
America has our own best 
interests at heart. Goodness, 
I’m just not sure what I’d do if I 
had more presents than I could 
fit under a tree. I’d have to have 
Christmas two days in a row just 
to get everything opened!
Somewhere along this bizarre 
journey that we call American 
history we’ve gotten terribly, 
horribly confused. Yeah, we’ve 
all heard the rant that Christmas 
has become nothing but one 
big commercial spending orgy. 
This is not news. The fact that 
it isn’t news is shocking on its
own, but it’s something that 
we’re going to have to accept 
for the time being. No, the fact 
that Christmas is just an excuse 
to spend hundreds of dollars 
on our loved ones, liked ones, 
and barely tolerated ones is not 
what’s so terrifying about these 
inverted trees.
It’s the fact that they’re killing 
one more Christmas tradition 
when we have so few left. 
Artificial Christmas trees are 
already becoming immensely 
popular, and that’s taking away 
one of the last remaining 
Christmas traditions that had 
become uncorrupted. My fam­
ily still goes out to the local 
parking-lot Christmas tree sale 
every year and pulls in a huge 
Douglas fir, one that barely 
fits in the back of our van and 
sure as hell doesn’t fit through 
our front door without losing a 
quarter of its needles. And we 
probably don’t spend more than 
$70 on it. We put the tree up 
and decorate it as a family with 
our stock of lights and orna­
ments that we’ve had for ten or 
fifteen years. For us, the tree is 
all about family, and even when 
we spend a majority of our 
Christmas holiday away from 
our home visiting relatives, we 
still buy that tree, decorate it 
as a family, and keep it watered 
and green.
I hope that the analysts are 
wrong, and that these inverted, 
artificial trees are just a fluke, a 
blip on the radar of the national 
consciousness that will go away 
like a bad dream. I really want 
to believe that making it easier 
to hang our ornaments and 
opening up precious cubic feet 
to stack mountains of handily 
gift-wrapped consumerism is 
not one of the guiding values 
of the American public. I sup­
pose we’ll have to wait and see. 
Merry Christmas, everyone.

well as The Tartan’s production

thankful that he can, for once, 
spend Christmas in his own 
house with a real tree and maybe 
snow, instead of a thousand miles 
away.

Addressing 
concerns 
over TBA
One of the most important 
student organizations at CMU, 
in terms of the sheer number of 
events planned for both campus 
and community members, is 
Activities Board (AB). AB is com­
posed of ten committees, all of 
which receive funding from your 
student activities fee through the 
Joint Funding Committee.
Some notable AB events this past 
semester have been a rock-climb­
ing wall, the Talib Kweli concert 
(this past Friday), lectures, and a 
comedy show earlier this month. 
Most students are familiar with 
AB Films, which does an amazing 
job showing movies in McConomy 
for only one dollar, Wednesday 
through Sunday.
This past week, however, AB 
Films has received a considerable 
amount of criticism about showing 
and advertising their “TBA” 
film. (For those unfamiliar with 
Carnegie Mellon’s “TBA” tradition: 
Each semester, a pornographic 
film is shown in place of a regu­
lar McConomy movie.) Concerns 
over the inappropriate content 
were first brought to my attention 
at a student government execu­
tive committee meeting where the 
chairs or presidents of all govern­
mental organizations (in atten­
dance) discuss what their particu­
lar groups are working on and 
what concerns they may have.
The two main issues currently 
under debate are: Should these 
films be shown on campus? and, 
if so, what type of advertising (if 
any) should be allowed? While I 
will not discuss my personal feel­
ings on the matter, I will share with 
you some facts about TBA and the 
process by which this year’s TBA 
movie was brought to campus.
AB reached an agreement with 
the distributor to receive the 
rights to the film (this year, it wag 
Pirates) for free by putting website 
URLs on some of the posters. Thus, 
none of your Student Activities fee 
went toward bringing this film to 
campus. The poster policy from 
the Undergraduate Student Senate 
does not prohibit sexual content, 
explicit or otherwise. Finally, a 
security guard was hired to cover 
the door to the auditorium and 
check ID for students who want to 
see the film.
I will be working with concerned 
students from all viewpoints, as 
well as governmental bodies, to 
begin discussions about the future 
of TBA films and their advertise­
ment on our campus. If you have 
any feelings on TBA, I would be 
happy to hear from you, as that’s 
the way I can best represent your 
opinions. Please feel free to send 
me an e-mail, call me, or stop and 
talk to me when you see me.
Tom Sabram (sbp@), your Student 
Body President, is a strong propo­
nent of the events and programs 
the Activities Board provides to 
campus. He can be seen at many of 
their programs. As always, he can

we both play.”
“I know Nate and I are ready 
and willing to take on more scor­
ing,” added Barlow-Wilcox. “I 
wouldn’t call it a burden at all. We 
are expected to score a lot more 
this year, and our teammates, our 
coaches, and ourselves know it.” 
Barlow-Wilcox and Maurer will 
be aided by what head coach Tony 
Wingen calls one of the best re­
cruiting classes in school history. 
Philadelphia-area guards Corey 
O’Rourke and Casey Taylor bring 
explosive quickness and athleti­
cism to Wingen’s vaunted pressure 
defense, and 6-8 big man Rob 
Pearson adds muscle and scor­
ing underneath. The team also 
returns three-point gunner A.J. 
Straub, shot-blocking forward 
Greg Gonzalez, and seniors Bary 
Dunn and Marques Johnson.
“This year we’re going to have 
to count on a lot of players that 
have very little or no game experi­
ence, and that could make things 
difficult,” Maurer said. “But they 
are all eager and ready to prove 
they can play significant minutes 
this year, and I have full confi­
dence in all of them.”
Still, it is unrealistic to expect 
the first-years to immediately 
make up for the contributions 
of the eight departed seniors. It 
will take them time to learn the
offensive sets, and to get accus­
tomed to the pace of the game 
at the college level. Even Taylor 
himself was somewhat cautious 
in his expectations for the year.
“I’d say right now, to be honest, 
my role is to get the other guys, 
the older guys ready to play,” said 
Taylor. “And when my number’s 
called, I’ll be ready to go.”
“All I’ve ever 
wanted to do... 
is play in the D-lll 
NCAA tournament.”
- Nate Maurer
Even if the first-years are 
not ready to play right away, 
though, the duo of Maurer and 
Barlow-Wilcox still gives the Tar­
tans a shot in every game they 
play. The two all-conference 
selections made 43 percent of the 
Tartans’ points a year ago, and 
Maurer believes they will be even 
more dominant this season.
“Can we duplicate our success?” 
he said. “I honestly expect to do 
better than last year. All I’ve ever 
wanted to do since my freshman 
year is play in the D-III NCAA tour­
nament. We have a lot of talent, 
so if we can gel well on the court I 
think we could be very good.”

still managed to finish in the top 
10 in the country. .
“We really didn’t run that 
well and we still got eighth as a
team,” said End. “This was excit­
ing because the top 10 teams in 
the nation are seen as dominant 
and now we’re in there.”
Even with the impending 
departures of End and Irrer, 
the Tartans are now firmly en­
trenched within the nation’s elite 
teams. This year’s team was the 
highest-ranked team ever under 
head coach Dario Donatelli, and 
next year, four first-years from 
the team will return, as will ris­
ing seniors, Geoff Misek and
Mike Bridenbaugh.
“I think it’ll always be hard to

said End. “They should have a 
very strong season next year 
though — a lot of good guys 
coming back.”

Last week the Carnegie Mel­
lon crew team competed at the 
annual Car-Du-Pitt regatta. The 
Tartans competed against Divi­
sion I foes from Duquesne and 
the University of Pittsburgh.
In the men’s division the Tar­
tans dominated, finishing with 
10 points to win the event.
In the novice division, the 
women won in the women’s 
eights event as well as both the A 
fours event and the B fours event. 
The novice men also won in the 
men’s eights event.
For the Tartans, the event was 
the culmination of the fall season
and was as much a year-end cel­
ebration as a competitive race. 
The team went to the race with 
no expectations, content just to 
enjoy it until the spring season.
As men’s rower Adam Suhy 
said, “Despite the chill in the air 
and the ice on the dock, the event 
was a success with all novices 
enjoying their races in the other­
wise beautiful weather.”
More information on the crew 
team’s season as well as contact 
information for those students 
interested in joining the team is 
available on the school’s athletic 
website.

Head coach Tony Wingen talks to his team during a timeout against Grove City on Saturday.
96-68 victory.
CMU does not begin the bulk 
of its schedule until December 3, 
when conference play starts up. 
But at least for now, the Tartans 
are happy with where they are.
“With a young team we’re far­
ther ahead than I thought we’d 
be,” said Maurer before this week­
end’s totirnament. “But we won’t 
know how good we are until we 
start playing some games.”
The Tartans’ real measuring 
stick will be fellow UAA foes such 
as Washington University, pre­
season champions Rochester, and 
Division I powerhouse Princeton. 
But the dominating wins over 
Grove City and Washington & Jef­
ferson certainly bode well for the 
Tartans as they seek to replace the 
core of last year’s squad, integrate 
10 new faces, and discover their 
identity as a team without falter­
ing on court.

It should go without saying, 
but now is a good time to be a 
Steelers fan in Pittsburgh. Just in 
case outspoken football fanatics 
like me have let you forget, Ben 
Roethlisberger is 18-1 during 
the regular season as a starter 
and 19-2 overall. The only team 
he’s lost to — the world-cham­
pion New England Patriots — is 
in fast decline. So what does it 
all add up to? Well, although 
there is quite a bit of fierce com­
petition around the league — 
especially in Indianapolis — 
there are serious reasons to think 
that this might be Pittsburgh’s 
year to go all the way (and win) 
for the first time since 1979.
Last year, our remarkable 
15-1 season began and ended 
with a then-rookie Roethlis­
berger, who jump-started the 
team when starting quarterback 
Tommy Maddox went down, but 
who also threw three intercep­
tions during the heartbreaking 
defeat at the AFC Championship 
game. With a year’s experience 
under his belt and a much better 
understanding of the playbook, 
he’s only thrown two picks so far 
this season and has developed 
into one of the sturdiest quarter­
backs in the league.
Furthermore, Roethlisberger 
has become a serious threat 
when he rolls out of the pocket. 
Other star quarterbacks like At­
lanta’s Michael Vick make their 
highlights by taking off when 
they are flushed outside. But 
while Roethlisberger possesses 
that option, he makes himself 
far more dangerous by holding 
his head up and looking to throw 
deep, keeping the defense off- 
balance.
It is not just Big Ben, though, 
who will make this the Steel­
ers’ year. The second-year quar­
terback is surrounded by the 
league’s deepest supporting
With Ben Roethlisberger at the helm, this could be the Steelers’ year to finally win the Super Bowl.
cast of players. Much like the 
vaunted Hydra of Greek mythol­
ogy, it seems that every time a 
key Steeler is injured there is an­
other equally dangerous team­
mate ready to step up and take 
his place.
Just look at the current situ­
ation at running back: Jerome 
Bettis is a future member of the 
Hall of Fame, Duce Staley is the 
premier runner Philadelphia is 
probably wishing they had back, 
Willie Parker has the speed to 
burn defenses for big gains, and 
third-down back Verron Haynes 
is one of the league’s best block­
ers out of the backfield. It is 
hard enough for defenses to 
prepare to stop one good run­
ning back, and should all four be 
healthy at the same time, a dom­
inating ground game is almost a 
guarantee.
Even with most of those 
guys out this year with injuries,
though, the Steelers’ running 
game has been one of the best 
in the league, and has helped 
to set up Big Ben and the pass­
ing attack. The success of the 
play-action has given the team 
real “big play” potential, allow­
ing star wide receiver Hines 
Ward to break former Steeler 
and Hall of Fame member John 
Stallworth’s reception record. In. 
addition, first-round draft pick 
Heath Miller is having a tremen­
dous first season as the starting 
tight end. He is currently tied 
with Hines Ward at six touch­
down catches, and he has been 
especially reliable on short third- 
down throws.
But while the offense may be 
making progress, this is Pitts­
burgh, and it is the defense that 
really gets the city fired up. 
Running out of Cowher’s old- 
school 3-4 set, the vaunted Steel 
Curtain defense of the ’70s has
returned, forcing opponents to 
pay for every inch of yardage in 
blood, or at least grass-stains. 
Up front, the line has dominated 
opposing runners, and is ranked 
third in the league in rushing, 
having given up just 82 yards per 
game. The improved secondary, 
meanwhile, led by newcomers 
Ike Taylor and Bryant McFadden, 
has become steadier against the 
big play and has really learned 
to clamp down in third-down 
situations.
Certainly much has changed 
since our last successful Super 
Bowl season, but one thing has 
very much stayed the same. 
In football, if you can’t score, 
you can’t win. And lately, when 
teams have been coming to Pitts­
burgh they have not been able 
to do much of either. That is 
why come January, it will be the 
Steelers playing in Detroit for 
the championship.

Carnegie Mellon blasts Grove City
Tartans win West Penn Classic with 80-64 home rout
by Colin J. Liotta
Junior Staffwriter
Coming into the 2005-2006 
season, the men’s basketball 
team faced a big question: How 
do you replace eight seniors, 
including three starters, and 
still manage to be competitive? 
Well, bringing in ten talented 
new first-years is certainly a 
good start.
The new-look Tartans began 
their season this weekend with 
a tournament at Grove City Col­
lege, and if there were ques­
tions about how well the young 
team would gel with all of the 
new pieces before the games 
began, there certainly were not
The Tartans started slowly 
against Grove City. They shot 
just 36 percent from the field in 
the first half and took only an 
eight-point lead into halftime. 
But CMU came out firing in the 
second half, and went on a 9-0 
run to break the game open. The 
game did not get close again, 
and head coach Tony Wingen 
was even able to give his first- 
years some playing time down 
the stretch.
With the win, the Tartans im­
proved to 2-0 on the season, 
and seem poised for another 
big year. But the players know 
they have a long season ahead 
of them, and that things aren’t 
going to get any easier.
“This is a good start to the

rebounds to record his second 
straight double-double of the 
tournament. His running mate,

Tartans’ hopes ride 
with Maurer and 
Barlow-Wilcox
by Andrew Clearfield
Sports Editor ¦
For senior Carnegie Mellon bas­
ketball star Nate Maurer, his sum­
mer trip to Italy was a chance to 
unwind, sightsee, and experience 
a foreign culture firsthand. When 
he wasn’t making trips to the 
Eiffel Tower or feasting on authen­
tic Italian pizza, though, Mau­
rer was on the basketball court. 
Teamed with nine Division I play­
ers from such basketball power­
houses as West Virginia and Penn, 
Maurer barnstormed through 
Italy, competing against some of 
Europe’s top national teams in a 
string of exhibition games.
The 6-7 forward was sur­
rounded by top-notch talent, and 
for once, was not required to be 
the go-to guy on offense. But 
while the experience may have 
added patience and variety to his 
already robust game, if the Tar­
tans are to duplicate last year’s 
record-setting season, it’s impera­
tive that Maurer remembers how 
to again dominate the offense.
Only Maurer and teammate 
Clayton Barlow-Wilcox return to 
the starting lineup from the team 
that last year went 19-7 and set 
the school record for wins in one 
season. The pair, which averaged 
just under 36 points per game last 
season, will be required to carry 
even more of the scoring burden 
this time around for the team to 
be successful.
“If we want to win, Clayton and 
I are definitely going to have to 
carry an even bigger load this 
year,” said Maurer. “We are the 
most experienced players on the 
team, and whether we win or lose 
will greatly depend on how well

was named tournament MVP 
and along with' teammate Nate 
Maurer, was selected to the tour­
nament’s All-Classic first-team. 
He averaged 16 points and 15 
rebounds for the tournament.
Men’s Cross-Country — senior

fifth at nationals with a time of

the Tartans to an eight place fin­
ish and will likely cause the Tar­

19 points per game over the 
course of the team’s two-game
tournament at Johns Hopkins

game, a three point loss to Johns 
Hopkins, Aleski scored 19 points 
and dished out three assists. In 
the second game, a 62-51 loss 
to York College, Aleski scored 
seven points and grabbed three 
rebounds. The Tartans next play

ber 26. They begin their confer­

Sports in Brief
The women’s basketball 
team lost their season opener to 
Johns Hopkins on Saturday night 
45-42. Down by seven points 
with just under 10 minutes to 
play, the Tartans fought back to 
tie the score at 40 on a Rachel 
Roll jumper with 2:35 remaining 
in regulation. A three-pointer by 
senior Katie O’Malley on the next 
possession was the difference in 
the game. The first-year tandem 
of Stacie Aleski and Gemma East­
erling scored 30 of the team’s 42 
points. Julie Miller was Hopkins’ 
leading scorer with 13 points.
In the third-place game,. Carn­
egie Mellon fell to York College 
62-51. Senior Dava Sommer- 
myer led the team with 12 points 
and six rebounds. First-years 
Roll and Ashley Rothwell each 
recorded double-digit rebounds,
totaling 13 and 11 respectively. 
Aleski chipped in seven points off 
the bench.
The men’s and women’s ten­
nis teams were each awarded 
their highest-ever national rank­
ings in the winter preseason poll 
released last week. The Tartan 
men are ranked 22nd in the 
country, and the CMU women 
are ranked 12th. The accolades 
come a year after both teams 
qualified for the NCAA tourna­
ment together for the first time in 
school history. The teams begin 
the bulk of their seasons in the 
spring.
The men’s soccer team was
awarded for its NCAA appear­
ance this year with six selections 
to the all-UAA team. CMU’s ca­
reer scoring-leader, Jonathan 
Browne, was named to the first
team, while Daniel Mastalski, 
Sean Filipovitz, and goalkeeper 
Mathew Bazin were named to 
the second team. Andrew Park 
and Matt Wilkinson were honor­
able mention picks. The Tartans 
were knocked out of the NCAA 
tournament in the first-round by 
Fredonia State in double over­
time.
‘ The women’s soccer team
also garnered six all-UAA selec­
tions. Amanda Rose was named 
to the first team, Lisa Pascoli and 
Nadya Yaghoubi were second- 
team selections, and Hallie Du­
mont and Mollie Salpeter were 
honorable mention choices. The 
Tartans narrowly missed the 
NCAA tournament, but won the 
ECAC championship with a 1-0 
win over Gettysburg University 
in double overtime.
Men’s cross-country finishes 
eighth at NCAA championships
by Jordan Koslosky
Junior Staffwriter
Considering that the Carnegie 
Mellon men’s cross-country team 
entered the season back in Au­
gust near the bottom of their di­
vision, one would think that their 
accomplishments so far would 
satisfy them: stunning the UAA 
field to win the conference title, 
and then shocking the regional 
field by finishing third and quali­
fying for nationals. But for Satur­
day’s NCAA championship race, 
the team was not content just to 
be at the prestigious event; they 
ran to win.
Senior Dana Irrer, running 
in his last collegiate race, again 
lifted the team on his back and 
carried the Tartans to eighth 
place overall. The two-time all- 
\
American came out flying on the 
hilly, muddy, and narrow course, 
and managed to stay with the 
lead pack nearly the entire way. 
His final time of 25:39.9 was 
good for fifth place, and helped 
propel the team to eighth overall 
in the race.
“Dana had the race of his life,” 
said fellow senior standout Nick 
End. “It was a great finish against 
a lot of talented runners.”
In many ways, despite the 
magnitude of the occasion, it was 
a fairly standard race for the Tar­
tans. Irrer and End got out fast 
in the lead pack of 50 runners as 
they have much of the year. By 
the first mile, the group slimmed 
down to 20 runners, with both 
Irrer and End comfortably in the 
mix. Finally, in the last two miles 
the pace accelerated consider­
ably and End finally dropped off
the pace, finishing 50th overall. 
Irrer, meanwhile, stayed close to 
the leaders until the final mile, 
when Néal Holtschulte of Wil­
liams College pulled away for 
the victory.
The supporting cast of junior 
Mike Bridenbaugh and first-years 
Brian Harvey and Bill Lordan 
once again made valuable con­
tributions, earning critical team 
points. Bridenbaugh finished 
100th, Harvey was 137th, and 
Lordan placed 155th in the mas­
sive field. These points proved 
critical because, with a total 
of 303, the Tartans inched past 
UAA rival University of Chicago 
by a single point.
The result was especially excit­
ing for the Tartans because in 
many ways it was a sub-par race

Walk the Line
The story of Johnny Cash that’s creating Oscar buzz
Courtesy of thejoyofsummerrain.homestead.com
Joaquin Phoenix gives a stellar performance in Walk the 
Line.
She’s no longer “legally blonde.” Reese With­
erspoon has traded in her pink legal pads to 
become something that is, above all else, real. 
Fans of the movie Vanity Fair will pleased to 
see Witherspoon prove, again, that she has the 
talent to play movies that don’t cater to fans of 
“chick flicks.” In Walk the Line, Witherspoon 
plays June Cash, the strong wife of one of mu­
sic’s greatest legends — Johnny Cash. Joaquin 
Phoenix (Emperor Commodus in 2000’s Gladi­
ator) plays Johnny. Both Cashes approved this 
choice of actors before their deaths in 2003; Ap­
parently, Johnny Cash had been impressed by 
Phoenix’s portrayal of Commodus, and gave the 
okay for filming.
The talent that the “Man in Black” was so im­
pressed with is evident when viewing scenes 
from the movie. Both Witherspoon and Phoe­
nix put forth a lot of effort into becoming these 
characters — and it shows. Both actors went 
through a “rock and roll boot camp” that in­
cluded music lessons, practice time, band prac­
tice, and practice recording sessions. Although 
the musical performances are great, the plot of 
the movie and the actors’ talent is what has cre­
ated its Oscar buzz.
Unlike those annoying biopics that attempt to tell 
a person’s entire life story in the span of two hours 
(or in the case of Ray, two and a half hours), Walk 
the Line refuses to give the viewer the CliffNotes 
on Cash’s life. Instead, it devotes a little over two 
hours to chronicling the time Cash spent from 
right before getting his record deal to his legend­
ary performance at Folsom Prison. Mostiy, the 
movie is dedicated to telling the story of the love 
affair between Johnny and June.
According to Cash, June is the reason he battled 
his addiction to methamphetamines. Walk the 
Line shows how his love of June brought Cash 
back from obscurity and made him into the leg­
endary performer he is known as today. Despite 
her background in less serious films, Wither­
spoon seems to have succeeded in transform­
ing herself into the strong, complex character of 
June Carter Cash.
Witherspoon’s talent is matched, if not sur­
passed, by the talent evident in Phoenix’s por­
trayal of the late Johnny Cash. He manages 
to become Cash, a feat that is not easy. In one 
scene, Cash is meeting with record company ex­
ecutives after his recuperation and they’re try­
ing to convince him not to perform at a prison
— after all, his listeners are Christian people, 
and they don’t want him singing to convicts. 
Cash’s response to this is strong and emphatic, 
yet affable. With any actor other than Phoenix, 
this attitude would be impossible to pull off. 
Phoenix does it outstandingly.
The movie is interesting even if you are not a fan 
of Cash’s music; it’s a biopic that can be viewed 
in its own right. Yes, Harry Potter just came out. 
Yes, most of us haven’t really listened to Johnny 
Cash, with the exception of music majors. But 
there’s a reason this movie is receiving Oscar 
buzz already.
Every once in a while, you have to watch a 
movie that makes you remember why you love 
movies — and if you’ve seen your fill of over­
done superhero movies and horrible sequels to 
mediocre movies, go out and see Walk the Line. 
Who knows, you might find your new favorite 
musician in the process.

The “Monte Carlo Carnival” was held on campus, The Tartan reported. 
For those of you who do not know, Monte Carlo is the gambling event

playing online poker or paying tuition.

November 25.1980
The Student Senate was elected bya low portion of the student popula­
tion: 15 percent, The Tartan wrote. The article continued to explain 
that for graduate student seats in senate, only five students out of 329 
students voted. Yeah, of those five, only four voters were actually eli­
gible. The fifth was me — I decided to take my DeLorean back to 1980 
so that I could change the course of Student Senate forever.
10 YEARS AGO 
November 20,1995
The Tartan asked students around campus what they thought about 
the new University Center, and what they would like to see included 
in the new building. Suggested things were: a walk-in freezer, a skate 
park, a Bruegger’s Bagels, and a place to get cheap, good food. Way to 
fall short of even my most realistic expectations, CMU.

A Tartan fashion columnist — yes, The Tartan had a fashion colum­
nist — tried to instruct the masses about proper times to wear winter 
clothes. “Why are people wearing shorts?” she complained. “I have 
heard that shorts are more comfortable. Personally, I cannot think of 
anything more uncomfortable than losing a leg to frostbite.”

A nostaglic Tartan staffer wrote of the most recent titans of music — 
Nirvana. “Rock will change, adapt, and thrive,” he wrote, “but, as Nir­
vana finally empties the vaults and closes the book on its semi-mythical 
career, remember that there will never be a party like that one again.” 
Maybe Nirvana wins out for “best party in recent history.” But if you ask 
me, that party at AEPi yesterday really brought down the house.

Crowd members sing along in the packed Weigand Gym.

study break. CMU and Pitt students, along with local 
Pittsburghers, filled the Wiegand Gym to see Brooklyn- 
born rappers Talib Kweli and J-Live.
In an interview before the show, J-Live — the concert’s 
opening act — talked about his developing career as a 
rapper. After high school, J-Live, who was already signed 
to a record deal, was forced to join the work force when 
the label shut down. In response he turned to teaching, 
which in turn impacted his rap.
Teaching, says J-Live, reminds the rapper that “you need 
to have the hook to keep kids’ attention.” J-Live, who has 
been rapping for lO years, is proud of how far he’s come, 
but also has plenty he wants to accomplish. “I have a lot 
to be proud of, but how much money goes into marketing 
my music — I’m not happy with that.... Never breaking 
into commercial radio — that can be improved. But I’m 
confident that I can take it where I need to take it in the 
future.
— 4---------------------
Onstage, J-Live is just as confident in his raps as he is in 
conversation. “Sidewalks,” according to J-Live, was writ­
ten in response to the atypical experience he had grow­
ing up in Brooklyn: “Growing up as a big kid with glasses, 
no one saw me as a ‘street’ dude. I didn’t see all the crazy 
things. I didn’t grow up around that. My mom pretty 
much kept me under lock and key. And if I’m not ‘street,’ 
then I’m the sidewalks, because I can still look at that 
type of thing from an outsider’s perspective.” J-Live used 
this mentality to his advantage, and learned how to use 
the turntables. He showed off his many talents on Friday 
night when he took control of the turntable rig, rapping 
and scratching on the turntables simultaneously.
When J-Live finished, the lights dimmed, and after a 
brief intermission world-renowned rapper Talib Kweli 
took the stage. Dressed in a black leather jacket (which 
quickly came off inside the sweltering gymnasium) and 
with a hood over his grey beret, Kweli rocked the 1300 
fans on hand. AB Tech’s fabulous light display and good 
work with acoustics — which is no small feat for a rap 
concert in a gymnasium — made the music crisp and the 
experience engaging. Kweli, whose new CD Right About 
Now comes out Tuesday, played a wide range of songs: 
some old, some as yet unreleased.

---------------------------------------------------

Among the highlights of the show was Kweli’s perfor­
mance of “Never Been in Love.” The lights dimmed down 
to pink as Kweli had the crowd throw up their hands in 
an L-shape. “I don’t care what people say, as long as you 
and me okay/ ‘cause I never been in love before ... all of 
this is new to me/this ain’t what I used to see/ ‘cause. I 
never been in love before,” the soulful chorus rang.
Kweli surprised the crowd when his DJ cued up the beat 
to Kanye West’s “Get Em High,” a song on which Kweli is a 
guest rapper. Kweli rapped West’s catchy chorus, as well 
as a freestyle of his own. “Education at Carnegie Mellon, 
you preserve it,” he rapped. Toward the end of his set, 
Kweli’s DJ blasted Sly Stone’s party-friendly “Dance to 
the Music.” Kweli in turn invited any break-dancers in the 
crowd to come up and dance. Kweli stood off to the side 
ripping through raps as the dancers treated the audience 
to some visual stimulation, something neither Kweli or 
J-Live were quite able to accomplish themselves.
Perhaps the highlight of the concert was when Kweli 
busted into the Kanye West-produced track “Get By.” 
Although most people in the audience didn’t know the 
words to Kweli’s other songs, many sang along eagerly 
with the expressive chorus: “This morning I woke up 
feeling brand new/I jumped up feeling my highs and my 
lows/in my soul/And my goals/Just to stop smoking, and 
stop drinking/And I’ve been thinking/I’ve got my rea­
sons/Just to get by.” Kweli, who lyrically is considered 
one of the most talented rappers (Jay-Z once rapped “If 
skills sold, truth be told, I’d probably be, lyrically, Talib 
Kweli”), showed off the power of his words in the second 
verse: “Some people get breast enhancements and penis 
enlargers/Saturday sinners, Sunday morning at the feet 
of the Father/They need somethin’ to rely on/We get high 
on all types of drugs, when all you really need is love.”
With plenty of people volunteering before and after the 
concert, AB Concerts chair Eileen Angulo was pleased 
with how things went. “Overall, the show went a lot 
smoother than I anticipated,” she said. “We had a lot of 
volunteers from Concert staff and Tech that were willing 
to put together a show that people wanted to see.” Kweli 
himself agreed: “It was a good show and a cool crowd,” 
he said after the show backstage. J-Live, standing by his 
side, nodded in agreement. Kweli’s mother, who was 
also on hand for the performance, said, “There are a lot 
of males!”
Yes, there are quite a lot of males here at CMU. None­
theless, the crowd was still supportive, energetic, and al­
ways smiling. Take that, male-to-female ratio.

It’s not sweet in the streets
A new perspective on the gangster image projected by rappers like 50 Cent
Rob “Biko” Baker didn’t take long 
to lose his sweatshirt at his talk last 
Wednesday. Underneath was a blue 
T-shirt that read, “Kanye was right.” 
But Baker wasn’t there to bash Bush, 
who Kanye West famously said 
doesn’t care about black people. 
Rather, Baker was there to bash 50 
Cent. In the wake of the Waterfront 
Loews Cineplex shooting, Baker, 
author of The Source’s article, “G- 
Unot! Is Corporate Rap’s Top Unit 
Fading Fast?”, decided to speak at 
Urban Youth Action about the image 
of “gangsta” rap and hip-hop.
Baker started right in on his criticism 
of rap’s image. “A lot of those things 
you see in the videos, the chains 
[and] the rims... they’re rented,” he 
said.
Baker wrote on the board behind him 
a diagram of all the people that make 
money off 50 Cent — including shoe 
stores, record labels, and Jacob the 
jeweler. “Everybody is making mon­
ey off of 50 Cent,” he said, “And 50 
Cent is making money off of you.”
He believes that the reason 50 Cent’s 
image is so appealing to young peo­
ple, especially those living in the 
poorer areas of cities, is because it 
tells a story familiar to these youth. 
“50’s telling the story of you,” Baker 
said, addressing the crowd of about 
70, most of them inner-city youths.
He said he was disgusted with some 
of what he saw on TV and heard in 
songs. “You go to the club and you 
don’t even think about [the lyrics],” 
he said. At one point, Baker started a 
chant of the Mr. Magic song “I Smoke, 
I Drink.” After a few lines, the chant 
dropped off and Baker laughed, say­
ing, “You don’t even want to finish 
it.” The crowd was hesitating on the 
line “I’m a dog/I love hoes.”
While Baker wouldn’t go so far as to 
directly connect the violence at the
isttCagM 21 caEmSCmA 2005.
Waterfront shooting with the film, he 
did say that 50 Cent was responsible 
for what was being portrayed. “The 
fault is less important than the prob­
lem,” Baker said, referring to violence 
in American cities.
The issue of what effect media such 
as movies and songs have on violence 
has been debated since Marilyn Man- 
son and the Columbine school shoot­
ings. It’s hard to attribute violence 
to media without feeling like one is 
shifting the blame. But it’s also dif­
ficult to look at the family of Shelton 
Flowers, the man shot at Loews after 
Get Rich or Die Tryin’, and not wonder 
if this wouldn’t have happened had 
Flowers gone to see Chicken Little or 
even Jarhead.
Flowers’ mother, wife, and sister were 
at Baker’s talk on Wednesday. His 
sister said she was happy that Loews 
had chosen to stop screening Get Rich 
or Die Tryin’.
Baker responded by saying, “It 
is irresponsible of us to let this 
keep going on.... This [the current 
situation] is not normal.” He said he 
believed that 50 Cent puts out a lot of 
“negative energy.”
Be assured that Baker does not believe 
the state of hip-hop is a complete 
wasteland that can only offer people 
a glorification of violence. He does 
think 50 Cent is talented. And some 
of his favorite hip-hop artists include 
Lil’ Brother and Talib Kweli, who 
performed on CMU’s campus Friday 
night. Hip-hop, he said, came about 
because people were being creative. 
But, Baker noted, artists like 50 Cent 
are the artists that corporate America 
invests in, so they are more likely to 
have a wide following even if their 
messages aren’t positive ones.

outcome.
Mark Levin has bad news for the public: The U.S. Su­
preme Court has strayed drastically from its founders’ 
intent. In his book Men in Black: How the Supreme Court 
Is Destroying America, Levin takes on the evolution of the 
Supreme Court from a simple wing of the government 
into a “judicial tyranny.” Levin is a constitutional lawyer 
who has a top-rated radio program on WABC; he’s served 
as a top adviser in presidential cabinets and been chief 
of staff to the attorney general of the United States. His 
deep love for constitutional law and American history are 
especially evident as he takes readers through the activist 
changes of the Supreme Court.
Levin outlines the framework on which our government 
was created. Men in Black explains that the Supreme 
Court’s original purpose was not to act as the final word 
on the law, but to interpret the law based on the United 
States Constitution.
The book starts out examining the first case in which the 
Supreme Court created law instead of simply interpret­
ing it, Marburyv. Madison. In that 1803 decision, “the Su­
preme Court determined that it had the power to decide 
cases about the constitutionality of congressional actions 
and — when it deemed they violated the Constitution
— overturn them.” This case, the book argues, laid the 
groundwork for the “runaway power exercised by the 
federal courts to this day.” The argument states that this 
decision was the point at which the judicial branch began 
to usurp the executive and legislative branches’ author­
ity
Levin continues to link judicial activism with the expan­
sion of the judicial branch’s power. The book argues that 
activist Supreme Courts are not a modern invention. In 
addition to the general concept of “judicial tyranny,” 
Levin points out there have been times when the Supreme 
Court ruled well outside the bounds of the U.S. Constitu­
tion to force unwelcome concepts onto private enterprise 
and individuals. The book evolves naturally, including 
the instances in which the Supreme Court created some 
overtly racist rulings.
Cases that advance this unconstitutional ebb and flow are
outlined throughout the chapters. Neither the 1856 Dred 
Scott decision forcing slavery in free territories, nor the 
1896 Plessy case that forced segregation in a private com­
pany, is ignored. It also doesn’t let the reader forget about 
the 1944 Korematsu case, which upheld the Roosevelt 
administration’s decision to place American citizens of 
Japanese descent into internment camps.
Levin uses his book as an effective tool to help anyone 
break down the series of poor judgments that have lead 
to the judicial branch’s power expansion. And although 
Men in Black lends itself to the political at times, at no 
point is the power of its message lost. The book paints a 
powerful and worrisome picture of a Supreme Court so 
intent on ignoring the founding documents that it even­
tually turns on the basic principles upon which this coun­
try was founded. For anyone interested in a history of the 
Supreme Court’s stray from its original intent, Levin’s 
book is a gratifying cover-to-cover read.

The story of a couple of regular Joes
A peek into the intriguing lives of two of our campus regulars: Bob and Peter
Justin Brown/Copy Staff
Bob sets up his stand in the University Center every week.
CMU and Starbucks: America’s top two caffeine hubs. But 
both enterprises have similarities that go beyond over­
priced products and rampant caffeine consumption. Just 
as Starbucks or any local coffee shop attracts its regular 
customers, CMU has established a community extend­
ing beyond tenured professors and hyperactive students. 
Walk down Forbes Avenue and you’ll find a writer pen­
ning a book that might be sold years later by CMU regular 
Bob the Book Guy.
Keep looking and you’ll see the businesswoman on her 
hurried morning commute — just the lifestyle that CMU 
regular Peter the Playwright has chosen to reject. Both 
men have lived lives more enthralling than the books be­
ing sold by one and the Hunt Library archives surround­
ing the other. Nestled in CMU’s busiest buildings, Bob the 
Book Guy and Peter the Playwright have enough stories 
to share to drive any studying student to distraction.
people to a campus some cannot wait to leave?
Peter the Playwright
The headline “DORIS DAY TO APPEAR AT COLGATE!” is 
the first thing that comes to mind looking into Peter the 
Playwright’s eyes. Reflected onto the oversized glasses of 
this undersized man, the words disappear as Peter turns 
the microfilm reader’s dial. He is working on the third 
floor of Hunt Library — an office for him that is just as 
established as Jared Cohon’s spot across the Cut.
Peter has become a staple for any late-night CMU stu­
dent riding a caffeine high before that big midterm. He 
resembles a gentler Arthur Miller, but his white-collared 
shirt and black Cadillac baseball cap are deceiving: Peter’s 
lifestyle is more The Crucible than Death of a Salesman. His 
unheated apartment is “far colder” than the frigid chill 
outside. Come December, Peter will leave CMU with the 
birds. Retreating into his apartment, Peter will have an 
electric blanket to warm his feet and mountains of copied 
pages from Theatre World to warm his memories.
Though he is currently at work on a two-part play that 
explores “the human need for and inability to give love,” 
Peter’s first love is music. “I was fascinated by the back­
ground music of movies I saw when I was a kid,” Peter 
explained. This lead him to CMU, where he auditioned 
for the School of Music. Sitting in the audition room, 
Peter followed a string of traditional upper-crust pieces 
by Mozart and Chopin with an upbeat pop song of the 
time. The tryout ended unsuccessfully, but fostered a re­
lationship for the musician that would last until his senior 
evenings.
Sometimes Peter will leave Hunt and travel over to the 
CFA practice rooms — the only place, he believes, in 
which he can play as he once did. “It’s almost like divine 
inspiration, the way the music comes out of my fingers 
when I’m in that building,” he said.
The massive watch on Peter’s left wrist is the ultimate 
irony. Ticking away its digital seconds, the dial is 15 min­
utes behind; not that it matters to Peter. He chooses to 
live without a phone and refuses to live .by appointments. 
This aligns with his life philosophy of “just marking time 
like a marching band in step.”
out of [Hunt Library] and driving through downtown. I 
stopped by a concert hall where I knew [Broadway star] 
Debbie Shapiro was performing.” Peter had just bartered 
for one of her CDs at a local flea market, and read from 
the program that Shapiro is always accepting work from 
non-professional songwriters.
“And wouldn’t you know it, just as I was walking toward 
the building she walked out. I handed her my song and she 
said ‘Oh, wow, another song,’ ” Peter explained, telling the 
story as if it were about him and his next-door neighbor. 
“I was expecting her to call the next day and say, ‘Gee, 
what a magnificent song,’ but she hasn’t called back yet.”
As a kid growing up in Pittsburgh, Peter used to go to the 
public library often. But don’t expect some cute story 
about developing a passion for books or government- 
funded buildings. “I used to see older people — the same 
ones — every day at the library,” he remembers. “And 
I remember thinking, gee, when I’m old like that I’m not 
going to spend my days in a library.”
Now, after working alongside CMU students for count­
less late nights, Peter offers this advice: “Get married. 
Have lots of children. Forget about books.” And don’t 
live a life led by a schedule, because Peter never knows, 
when he walks out Hunt Library’s automatic door, if 
he’ll be back tomorrow, newspaper in hand — except 
on Sunday, when asking $1.50 for the news is just a 
little “ridiculous.”
Bob the Book Guy
Set up behind the UC’s black chairs are tables of books 
more entertaining than the textbooks most kids carry 
around all day. Standing behind this contemporary li­
brary is a man clad in practical clothes and a hairstyle 
whose greased, slick front channels Steve Buscemi, and 
whose curls in the back seem like an antiquated Shake­
spearean actor.
Bob “the Book Guy” Waskowitz has a stack of books for 
sale on Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg, and the whole 
Beat Generation, but he could tell you that story bet­
ter himself. The question his customers ask the most is, 
“What is your favorite book?” “On the Road,” he replies, 
after hesitation and deliberated thought.
But Bob the Book Guy does not list the road-trip classic 
as a favorite because of the freedom it advocates. He 
lists it because it is a vestige of a life he once lived.
Bob is a true product of the 1960s — a liberal ex-hippie
“We have one patron who has been known to be here for In his mind, Peter’s life is a slow time-step, but none of

who still hasn’t lost his drive for change and question. He 
has been married to the same woman for over 30 years, 
and has two children with her. Their first was named Cas- 
sady, after real-life Jack Kerouac friend Neal Cassady, 
a legendary hero of the Beat movement. To better raise 
their children, Bob and his wife moved from Oakland to 
the outlying suburbia.
“The most exciting thing these people do is cut their 
grass,” he laments. “Sometimes I’ll be up at 10 pm read­
ing or journaling or whatever and I look outside and every 
light is off.” It’s given him some good material, though. 
Bob sees some striking similarities in the sexually frus­
trated nuns who taught him in Catholic high school and 
the sexually frustrated mothers strolling down his street.
The housing development world he leaves to come to 
CMU, he says, is a “fucking wasteland.”
%
Bob can sell you books on ancient Egyptian hieroglyphics 
and Persian rugs, but he could also tell you a story about 
those exotic locales, too. Asking him where he’s traveled
reads like the cities at the bottom of high-end fashion 
designer ads: “Montreal, Paris, New York, Amsterdam...” 
He says that last one with a grin.
“Have you read all of these books?” a sophomore asks as 
she peruses the spines. That, Bob explains, is the second 
most asked question. No, he hasn’t. But he’s read a lot of 
them.
“The prices are written in pencil on the first page,” he re­
minds his crowd. And when an art student buys a novel 
by William S. Burroughs, Bob asks if he likes “oP Billy,” 
treating the author like a close confidant.
He spends the week living among lawn groomers and 
leaf counters, but Bob spends his days on the campus 
of Carnegie Mellon. Ask his old neighbor Colleen Carr 
if he has any interesting stories to share. “Oh, he has a 
million,” she says immediately. But Bob doesn’t think of 
himself as that engaging of a guy. He knows that if his 
neighbors knew half the things he’s done, they’d cringe. 
And he wouldn’t have it any other way.
A place within the campus community
When Jared Cohon stands at the podium during Convo­
cation and welcomes the incoming class to the “campus 
community,” he is acknowledging more than brilliant 
scholars and potential Nobel Laureates.
Here are just two examples of people who have lived 
the stories studied at CMU — stories far more arresting 
than the typical Grandma-around-the-campfire fare. 
Though their offices are separated by overwhelming aca­
demic buildings, the Fence, and around-the-clock tennis 
players, Peter the Playwright and Bob the Book Guy are ^ 
colleagues who join the hundreds of “teachers” found 
at CMU.

Big Al’s Metal Review
How Machine Head managed to make a comeback
Artist: Machine Head 
Documentary: Elegies DVD 
Label: Roadrunner Records
Artist: Anthrax 
Album: Alive 2 
Label: Sanctuary Records
There are many words that come to mind when I think 
of these two bands. Talent is the most obvious choice. 
Integrity, however, describes their longevity and the loy­
alty of their fans. In the case of Machine Head, imagine 
yourself in this scenario:
Having been dropped by your label and rejected by every 
possible suitor you approach, would you (a) change your 
name or (b) call it a day? Machine Head did the obvious. 
They went back into their studio to record the most 
blistering tribute to their past and what-they-felt-could- 
have-been-their-future, if only the labels would take their 
heads out of their asses. If these guys were going out, 
then their latest disc, Through the Ashes of Empires, would 
seal their legacy. t
It wasn’t always like this. In 1994, they brought Ameri­
can thrash back, and infused it with a fire that took the 
metal world by storm. Touring the world, bringing their 
madness with them, they inspired many copycat acts.
1997 brought The More Things Change, and Machine 
Head went from upstarts to heavyweights. Like a Ten Ton 
Hammer coming down, the sheer brutality of the riffs 
laid down, coupled with their intense lyrics, carved a new 
place for them alongside bands like Metallica and Sepul- 
tura. But like their NorCal home, there would be a foggy 
period awaiting them.
First off would be the seemingly continual lineup changes. 
Drummer Chris Kontos left after the first album, Logan 
Mader (guitar) after the second. With The Burning Red 
and Supercharger, their next two albums, proving too 
experimental for some fans, Machine Head found them­
selves without a label.
Of course, it wasn’t their fault that Roadrunner made 
an untimely mistake by releasing Supercharger on 
September 11, 2001, with a single called “Crashing 
Around You.” And with an industry in flux, dominated 
by mega-corporations owned by companies with no his­
tory in the music business, a band without a hit single is a 
band without a label.
Slowly, though, things fell into place, as detailed on the 
DVD. Their first good move was the decision to return to
their roots. Second was getting Phil Demmel into the fold 
as a second guitarist to replace yet another departure.
Having someone who believed in this band as much as 
Demmel helped tremendously, and setting forth to record
The guys of Machine Head managed to make a comeback after 
being dropped by their label.
they found themselves signing a European distribution 
deal with Roadrunner Records, the same label that had 
dropped them.
Upon release, the band thought that TTAOE could 
possibly sell a few thousand copies the first week. Word of 
mouth tripled that, and the band and their new-old label 
were slackjawed with the demand for this band whom 
everyone had counted out — everyone but Machine 
Head themselves. That, in a nutshell, is the story of the 
last album, and of a band in transition.
A little more real than Metallica’s movie, Elegies is a docu­
mentary packaged with a sold-out performance at Lon­
don’s Brixton Academy. Mixed and produced well, this is 
a great recording of the reception the new songs received 
live. Consider that Europe has always given this band bet­
ter reception than we stateside, and you have a winning 
disc.
Now consider Anthrax. Alongside Metallica, Slayer, and 
Megadeth, they forged the music we now call thrash metal. 
A thoroughly American mixture of the best of the New 
Wave of Brit metal with the Yankee penchant for speed, 
this potent music goes straight for the jugular. Metallica, 
of course, went on to stardom, and Megadeth and Slayer 
have eeked out nice livings, Slayer staying true to their 
roots and fans the whole way through. But Anthrax, for 
whatever reason, has always had obstacle after obstacle 
thrown their way. Label changes, an amazing album 
(,Stomp 442) not promoted, you name it.
They did crack the mainstream nicely with The Sound 
of White Noise, and have never sold out. But TSOWN was 
a definite sea change in the songwriting and playing. 
Getting the raspy John Bush to replace Joey Belladonna 
brought them initial commercial success and continued 
musical integrity, but somehow people always asked 
about the classic Belladonna/Spitz/Bello line-up. And if 
they won’t reunite now, on their 20th anniversary as a 
band, then when?
My first metal album was Attack of the Killer B’s, a collec­
tion of (what else) B-sides and covers. I was hooked at
16 — can you imagine thrash metal mixed with Public 
Enemy? Well, you can now because of Anthrax; pioneers 
willing to take a chance in the face of ridicule. *
A million ball-cap-wearing frat boys thank you, boys! Just 
kidding, y’all. In the face of all the love shown them by 
their long-time fans, the classic Anthrax have released 
a live album/DVD recorded in their hometown (well, 
sort of) Sayerville, New Jersey. A collection of all the hits 
you banged your head to when you still had hair, this is a 
beautiful addition to your DVD collection.
One more before I go is Judas Priest’s Rising in the East. A 
document of their reunion with Rob Halford, this filmed- 
in-Japan concert is now in stores. Check ’em all out.
Until next time,

HOROSCOPES.
“' Waia kSvwc
Aries (March 21 - April 19): It may be time to consider taking some classes 
outside of your major next semester. How about “Power Walking for Your 
Heart” or "The Rise of Modern Golf 1860-2005"?
Taurus (April 20 - May 20): Yes, you wore baggy jeans. And yes, you wore an 
oversized coat to the Talib Kweli concert. But come back to reality and your 
"higher education" — you have a problem set due tomorrow.
Gemini (May 21 - June 21): Plane tickets home: $300. Thanksgiving dinner 
for the family: $200. Realizing that Thanksgiving is the last time you’ll really 
eat until finals are over, thanks to all the work you have: Priceless.
Cancer (June.22 - July 22): You may not be thinking too clearly after all the 
turkey this week, so when you’re thinking of calling your advisor and telling 
him you want to drop your MechE degree and take up English, take a nap 
instead.
Leo (July 23 - August 22): While your dream has always been to have a 
serious relationship going out of college, it’s senior year and, well, things aren’t 
looking good. May I suggest putting down your new-Xbox 360 and going out 
somewhere this weekend?
Virgo August (23 - September 22): Feeling a little bit violated after being 
conned into going to Pirates last night? Don’t worry, you’re safe on campus; 
just avoid the pool and anyone with a captain’s hat.
Libra September (23 - October 22): Flying can be really stressful, especially 
during holiday times, so when you’re staring at that fifth Jäger Bomb, take a 
step back and think, “What airline am I flying with tomorrow?” Then drink up 
. anyway.
Scorpio (October 23 - November 21): It's Thanksgiving this week, which 
means you’re probably going to be spending a lot of time with those extended 
family members you’ve been avoiding since Christmas. But keep your stinger 
under control — some of those family members have large inheritances just 
waiting to be given out.
Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21): While you’re known as "the 
Hunter," try using your hunting skills only when looking for a relationship. No 
one wants to see you chasing turkeys around some snowy field in the middle 
of nowhere.
Capricorn (December 22 - January 19): It’s getting close to finals, and like so 
many others, you're still single. Who cares? It’s cold outside — go curl up on 
a couch with Love Actually and belt some "Christmas is all around me” until 
you feel completely in need of a cuddle buddy.
Aquarius (January 20 - February 18): Be on guard on your daily walk to 
Starbucks this week — someone from your past is just waiting for the right 
moment to reappear and ruin your caramel macchiato.
Pisces (February 19 - March 20): Feeling romantic this week? Before that 
gorgeous psychology major flies home to her family, whisk her off Downtown for 
some pre-Thanksgiving ice skating. Just make sure you know what you’re doing 
and don’t require thrfee medics and a stretcher to carry you off the ice.

A massive line formed outside of McConomy Auditorium for the 10 pm 
showing of Sunday night's sold-out, controversial TBA movie showing 
of Pirates. The line's end wrapped around the edges of Kirr Commons, 
to the UC’s racquetball courts. In all, 1020 students were admitted to 
the three shows. The second two shows were completely sold out.
