President Robert Mehrabian has de­
cided to uphold the University Commit­
tee on Discipline’s (UDC) February 3 
decision to remove Alpha Tau Omega 
from University housing until the fall 
semester of 1994. In addition, ATO was 
fined $250 for disorderly conduct.
ATO will not lose University recogni­
tion as a fraternity, nor will it lose its 
charter as a result of this decision.
ATO President Chris Dee, a __________
sophomore economics major, 
said “People are really upset.
[Their feelings] are a mixture 
of sadness and anger.... 
Everyone’s kind of amazed, 
startled. It seemed like we 
were doing the right things 
for the campus, and making 
the right changes.” An ATO 
brother who asked not to be 
identified said that he felt the 
house was “getting the shaft.”
Bill Elliott, University vice-president 
for Enrollment, said that the decision 
was reached by himself, Mehrabian, and 
Michael Murphy, dean of Student Af­
fairs, within the last two weeks.
“The three of us sat down and debated
the pluses and minuses of the decision,” 
Elliott said, “We took all the facts and 
figures into consideration.... I think that 
we reached the decision we did after 
careful consideration.” Elliott refused to 
comment on the exact details of the 
discussions.
“We’ve done everything that we can to 
make the fraternities and sororities un­
derstand that we’re sympathetic to 
them,” said Pat Hamed, assistant dean 
of Student Affairs and Greek adviser, 
“But we’re trying to hold them to a stan-
“[ATO] has not taken action to 
control the behavior of a few, in 
spite of clear warning of severe 
penalty. ”
— Bill Elliott, VP for Enrollment
dard that will enable them to last for a 
long, long time.”
“ATO, unfortunately, wasn’t able to 
live up to that standard,” she said, add­
ing that “none of us were happy about 
this decision.”
“I think that any Greek organization
getting kicked off of campus is a blow to 
the Greek community,” said Andy 
Bordick, a fourth-year architecture stu­
dent and president of Pi Kappa Alpha. “I 
can’t justify what ATO did, or what 
they’re known for, but any loss is a loss 
to the Greek community. I definitely 
think that it’s a bad thing.”
Jody Lutz, a senior social & decision 
sciences major and president of Inter- 
fraternity Council, said he was shocked 
by the ruling. “I don’t think that they 
deserve it, and I feel bad about it.”
_______ In a letter sent to Dee and
distributed to all ATO brothers, 
Elliott said, “I have carefully 
reviewed this matter. I have 
spoken with you and brothers of 
the chapter, with alumni, with 
an officer of your national orga­
nization, with Dean Murphy, 
and President Mehrabian.... I 
have been struck by the concern 
of some for the continuance of 
the Alpha Tau Omega chapter 
at Carnegie Mellon. I am also struck, 
however, by the recognition of many ... 
that ATO has not conducted itself in a 
manner in keeping with the general 
standards of the Greek letter commu­
nity at Carnegie Mellon.”

Student Senate and the Elec­
tions Board released the unoffi­
cial elections results on Wednes­
day, April 7. David Wolpert, a 
; junior applied history major, was 
elected Student Government 
President over James Spencer 
Brown, a junior ECE major.
These elections results are un­
official until vali­
dated once by the 
Elections Board 
this Wednesday, 
and then again 
by Student Sen­
ate one week 
from tomorrow.
Wolpert ex­
pressed great 
pleasure with the 
election process. “The best thing 
about running for any political 
position is that one gets the op­
portunity to meet and work with 
a wide array of interesting people. 
From the beginning of the cam­
paign to the present, I’ve been 
surrounded by a group of dedi­
cated students who genuinely
care about their school,” said 
Wolpert. Wolpert said that he 
was looking forward to working 
with a “dynamic” Student Gov­
ernment in the future.
Brown said that he still intends 
to be actively involved in Student 
Government, despite not being 
elected President. Brown said, “I 
ran for Student President because 
I was tired of the Student Senate 
ignoring students’ views and of
“I’ve been surrounded by a group 
of dedicated students who genu­
inely care about their school. ”
— David Wolpert, Student 
Government president-elect
the Student President doing noth­
ing. The fact that I lost is unim­
portant.” Brown also spoke highly 
of his opposition, having said, “He 
ran a great race, and I feel that a 
good number of the students were 
behind him. Furthermore, he has 
the drive and initiative that the 
Student Government President
has been lacking for a long time.” 
Student Government President 
David Martin was elected trea­
surer, a post which was vacated 
by J ay Laefer at the end of the fall 
semester and was not filled this 
semester. “I’m still trying to fig­
ure out how I managed 49 yotes. 
I don’t think there were thatinany 
people who knew I was running 
for treasurer. [This is] two elec­
tions I’ve won without advertis­
ing. If only the na­
tional people were 
so fortunate,” said 
Martin, who re­
cently became Pres­
ident after the res­
ignation of Natalie 
Gesmond.
A few kinks still 
need to be worked 
out of the list of 
elected Senators. Tie votes in the 
College of Fine Arts, Industrial 
Management, and the School of 
Computer Science still need to be 
resolved. Also, it is doubtful that 
Peanuts character Snoopy will be 
available to fill the GSIAfall seat, 
meaning one vacancy is probably 
imminent.
Unofficial Student Gov’t elections results
Student Government elections results are unoffi­
cial until ratified by the Elections Board on Wednes­
day, April 14, and by Student Senate on Tuesday,

Student Senate to consider Activities Fee raise
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
The Funding and Recognition Committee 
(F&R) of Student Senate made a formal rec­
ommendation at last week’s Senate meeting to 
ask the Board of Trustees to raise the student 
Activities Fee by $5 each semester, to bring it 
to a total of $110. This information was posted 
on assoe.student-senate, as well as most assocs 
bboards. Senate will vote on this recommen­
dation in tomorrow’s meeting. If passed by 
Senate and accepted by the Trustees, the in­
crease will take place in the spring 1994 se­
mester.
According to the Bylaws of the Student Body,
Senate does not have the power to raise the 
Activities Fee. This is the sole prerogative of 
the Board ofTrustees. Also, the recommenda­
tion was proposed last week to allow for noti­
fication time, also in accordance with the by­
laws.
The complete text of the recommendation 
reads as follows:
“Whereas, Student Senate has been facing 
tremendous difficulty meeting the financial 
needs of the various student organizations it 
allocates funding to, and 
“Whereas, the costs incurred by student 
organizations have been steadily increasing, 
and
“Whereas, there is little money available for
emergency needs of student organizations 
or for the betterment of the campus environ­
ment; therefore,
“Be it resolved by Student Senate that 
Student Senate recommend to the Board of 
Trustees of Carnegie Mellon University that 
the Individual Activities Fee be increased by 
five (5) dollars per semester, increasing it to 
fifty-five (55) dollars per semester, and 
“Be it further resolved that Student Sen­
ate recommends that this increase take ef­
fect for the spring semester of 1994.” 
Interested students should contact their 
Senator for more details, or attend the Stu­
dent Senate meeting tommorrow night at 7 
pm in the Wherrett Room.
Good weather and bright sun 
brought many students out onto 
the Cut (and a fow out of their 
classes.) Weather services report, 
however, thattemperatures won't 
go over 65 degrees all this week. 
No definite word on rain over the 
weekend.

White House releases details of U.S. budget
WASHINGTON, April 9 (DJ) — On 
the day of his first visit to the Penta­
gon, President Bill Clinton released 
further details on his plans to shift 
spending front defense to domestic“in-
• vestment” priorities, The Wall Street 
Journal reported.
In m ore than 1,400 pages, the White 
House fleshed out the five-year spend­
ing outline it released in February, 
with a focus on the fiscal year that 
begins October 1. As indicated then, 
spending in fiscal 1994 would rise for 
items ranging from rural development 
programs to global warming research 
to high-capacity telecommunications 
networks that would link schools, li­
braries, and other information sources. 
Besides defense spending, outlays 
would fall for a variety of programs, 
including nuclear reactor development 
and federal crop insurance.
Congress has already moved beyond 
Clinton’s plan. Last week lawmakers 
gave final approval to a nonbinding 
budget resolution that calls for cut­
ting the federal budget deficit by $496 
billion over five years, under congres­
sional score-keeping methods.
Under the Clinton proposal, outlays 
for fiscal 1994 would rise to $1.5 tril­
lion, up 3.2 percent from $1,468 tril­
lion in 1993. That compares with fis­
cal 1994 outlays of $1,496 trillion un­
der the congressional resolution. It 
would take outlays of $1.527 trillion to 
maintain the current level of services, 
the White House budget office says. 
Revenues would rise to $1,251 trillion 
in fiscal 1994, up 9.2 percent from 
$1,146 trillion in fiscal 1993. That 
compares with $1,242 trillion under 
the congressional resolution.
Among areas that would get less 
funding than under current services 
levels are defense, commerce, and 
housing. Programs that would do bet­
ter than under current services in­
clude science and space, agriculture, 
transportation, and education.
The budget resolution passed by
Congress doesn’t allow for all the 
spending that Clinton proposed. White 
House Budget Director Leon Panetta 
said the administration would meet 
the congressional targets.
The proposed $263.4 billion in bud­
get authority for defense in fiscal 1994 
continues the eight-year trend of cut­
ting defense spending. Increases are 
slated for a few areas. Most notably, 
spending on the environmental 
cleanup of military bases would in­
crease to $2.31 billion from $1.19 bil­
lion in the current fiscal year.
The Federal Communications Com­
mission would pick up an extra $12 
million, bringing the agency’s pro­
jected 1993 budget to $145.5 million.
The budget of the National Aero­
nautics and Space Administration 
(NASA) carries out a major Clinton 
administration effort to pare expen­
sive space missions to free up money 
for smaller projects of more direct 
benefit to industry and the economy. 
Although Clinton is proposing to cut 
$11 billion to $15 bil lion off the space 
station’s current price tag of $31 bil­
lion, he is recommending to increase 
NASA’s overall outlays to $14.7 bil­
lion in fiscal 1994 from $14,1 billion.
The U.S. civil aviation industry is 
one of the biggest winners; civil aero­
nautics research is slated for a 55 
percent increase by 1998. For next 
fiscal year, Clinton is seeking $101 
million, compared with $12 million 
now, to improve designs for the next 
generation of subsonic commercial 
jets; an $80 million increase to $187 
million to develop technologies for a 
supersonic airliner to succeed the 
European-built Concorde; $80 million 
to resume work on an aerospace plane; 
and $200 million to modernize and 
build wind tunnels thatindustry could 
use for testing new designs. NASA 
still wants to fly eight shuttle mis­
sions a year, but NASA administrator 
Daniel Goldin said the budget will be 
pared 25 percent over five years.

U.S. planes fire 
on Iraqi artillery 
installation
NEW YORK, April 9 (AP) — Three 
U.S. Air Force F-16G jets and an F-4G 
electronic warfare plane bombed an Iraqi 
anti-aircraft artillery post in the no-fly 
exclusion zone in northern Iraq after 
being fired at, the Defense Department 
said.
In response to the Iraqi anti-aircraft 
fire, the three U.S. F-16G jets dropped a 
total of four cluster bombs on the Iraqi 
anti-aircraft site. The Defense Depart­
ment said it had no damage assessment 
yet for the impact on the Iraqi air de­
fense system on the ground.
The Defense Department statement 
emphasized that the Iraqi air defense 
site was operational within the no-flight 
exclusion area, against the U.N. Secu­
rity Council resolution on this matter.
The four U.S. aircraft completed their 
mission without further incident before 
returning to the Turkish air force base 
at Incirlik, the statement said.
A Clinton administration official, 
speaking only on condition of anonym­
ity, said the incident happened “north of 
the 32nd parallel,” which marks the no- 
fly zone.
“We dropped munitions in response 
and the aircraft returned,” said the offi­
cial. He said details at this time were 
sketchy.
Iraq said a soldier guarding a dam was 
wounded in the'latest exchange. The 
state-run Iraqi News Agency quoted a 
Foreign Ministry spokesman as saying 
the nation dropping the bombs would 
“bear responsibility for this aggressive 
and provocative behavior.”
The spokesman said the soldier was 
wounded while on guard duty in the 
northern Nineveh province. No further 
details were given in the agency dis­
patch, monitored in Cyprus.
Official reports on ban on gays 
in military
WASHINGTON, April 9 (AP) — The 
Pentagon’s top health official says ho­
mosexuality is not a medical-issue that 
should be considered in the debate over 
gays and lesbians in the military, ac­
cording to a published report.
According to The Washington Times, 
Dr. Edward Martin, acting assistant sec­
retary of defense for health affairs, wrote 
in a memo that, “We are not aware of any 
scientific evidence that... sexual prefer­
ences, in and by themselves, be they 
homosexual, heterosexual, or bisexual, 
affect productivity, scholastic aptitude, 
disease incidence, medical costs, or crime 
rate in the population at large.
“Since homosexuality, per se, cannot 
scientifically be characterized as a medi­
cal issue, DoD policies related to homo­
sexual behavior should be based upon 
military personnel, unit and mission 
concerns and considerations...” the memo 
said.
Some supporters of the current ban on 
gays, lesbians, and bisexuals say the 
higher rate of some diseases, such as 
AIDS, among gays, and the associated 
treatment costs, should be considered as 
Congress decides whether to lift the ban.
It was not clear from the report why 
Martin wrote the document, titled “Medi­
cal Implication of Homosexuals in the 
Military.” The Washington Times said 
that Martin circulated it among Penta­
gon health officials.
Cuomo, New 
York judge turn 
down nomination
WASHINGTON, April 8 (DJ) — New 
York Governor Mario Cuomo took him­
self out of the running to fill a coming 
Supreme Court vacancy, saying that he 
preferred to stay active in state and 
national politics, The Wall Street Jour­
nal reported. Cuomo had been the clear 
front-runner being considered by Presi­
dent Bill Clinton. Now, the President 
will turn to a long list of other candi­
dates whom he and his advisers already 
had been discussing, White House offi­
cials said.
In a letter dated yesterday, Cuomo 
confirmed a telephone conversation last 
Thursday during which he told the Presi­
dent that he didn’t want to be considered 
for the Supreme Court. On Monday last 
week, Clinton tried to call Cuomo to tell 
him that he was a serious candidate to 
succeed Justice Byron White, who an­
nounced March 19 that he plans to retire 
this summer.
The two missed the connection, but in 
the meantime, White House aides con­
veyed the message to Cuomo. The gover­
nor was the only person the President 
tried to contact about the vacancy, ac­
cording to Clinton aides.
*By Thursday, Cuomo had decided he 
didn’t want the job and told the Presi­
dent when Clinton phoned from Air Force 
One while traveling to the environmen­
tal summit in Portland, Oregon.
New York state’s new chief judge, 
Judith Kaye, today took herself out of 
the running for a seat on the U.S. Su­
preme Court. Kaye made the announce­
ment one day after Cuomo said he did 
not want to be considered for the court 
seat being vacated by White.
In a letter to Clinton confirming his 
plans to bow out of the hunt for a new 
Supreme Court justice, Cuomo had put 
in a plug for Kaye. But Kaye, in a state­
ment issued by the New York Court of 
Appeals, said she wanted to stay with
the New York court. Court of Appeals 
spokesman Richard Zander said he didn’t 
know if Kaye had informed the White 
House of her decision.
Clinton declined to comment about 
Cuomo’s decision. “There were other 
names being looked at,” said one Clinton 
adviser. Clinton has been under consid­
erable pressure to choose a woman or a 
member of a minority group.
Poll shows no 
decisive lead in Russian vote
MOSCOW, April 11 (AP) — A nation­
wide vote of confidence in President Boris 
Yeltsin is just two weeks away, and yet 
an Associate Press poll has found that 
neither he nor his critics have a decisive 
lead.
The informal survey of about 50 politi­
cians and newspaper editors nationwide 
also found that Yeltsin’s backers are 
loosely organized. Support for him and 
his market reforms varied widely from 
city to city in Russia.
Yeltsin initially proposed the referen­
dum to end his power struggle with 
Congress. It was to ask voters whether 
the president or the Congress should 
wield the real power in Russia. But the 
legislature changed the format of the 
referendum to multiple questions, so 
that Yeltsin cannot win by majority 
alone.
NATO prepares to enforce no-fly 
zone over Bosnia
AVIANO, ITALY, April 11 (AP) - 
U.S. Military personnel are busy pre­
paring NATO crews and equipment to 
start enforcing a ban on flights over 
Bosnia.
About 300 American troops for. “Op­
eration Deny Flight” arrived last week 
at the Aviano air base in northeast Italy. 
Nearly 60 American, Dutch, and French 
fighter jets are to begin their patrols for 
violators early tomorrow afternoon. The 
first NATO military mission outside its 
members’ territory is meant to pressure 
Bosnian Serbs to stop the war against 
the Muslims.
NATO says planes will order violators 
to turn back, and will shoot them down 
only as a last resort. Ground positions 
are to be attacked only in self defense.

New sororities formed at CMU
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Two new sororities have become active on 
campus in the last two weeks. Zeta Psi Sigma is 
a new independent sorority not recognized by the 
panhellenic Council (Panhel) or Greek Council. 
Delta Sigma Theta is a city-wide chapter whose 
three CMU members were granted special sta­
tus on campus by Panhel.
According to Demian Johnston, Greek Council 
president, and Joanne Kievan, president of the 
Panhellenic Council, a group of women ap­
proached Panhel about forming another house 
after Chi Omega closed at the beginning of the 
fall 1992 semester. Panhel decided not to recog­
nize the group, who called themselves Zeta Psi 
Sigma, as a member of Greek Council or Panhel.
Heather Farley, a freshman rhetoric major 
and sister of Zeta Psi Sigma, said that new 
officers elected to Panhel in February uncovered 
a rule in the Panhel Bylaws which stated that 
expansion, formation of a new sorority, could not 
take place unless all other houses were full. 
Farley said that the 14 women who came to 
Panhel “felt cheated” by the decision, but under­
stood the rules under which it was made.
Six sisters in Zeta Psi Sigma are former Chi 
Omegas who gave up all affiliation with the 
chapter, said Zeta Psi Sigma president Julie 
Saltman, a junior drama major. According to 
Saltman and sophomore technical writing major 
Alisa Levine, vice president, Panhel was worried
that a new sorority would reduce rush numbers 
for other houses, hurting the system.
“They’re concerned about numbers,” said 
Saltman, who said that the sisters had no inten­
tions to hurt the system. Levine said, “We’re just 
trying our best to be a group. That’s all we’ve 
wanted and we intend to stay that way.”
David Ewald, public relations chair for Greek 
Council, said that he did not want to see conflict 
between Zeta Psi Sigma and the Greek govern­
ing bodies. “I think the main thing is that we 
definitely want good relationships between Zeta 
Psi Sigma and Panhel and Greek Council,” said 
Ewald. According to Johnston, the decision to not 
recognize Zeta Psi Sigma was a joint decision of 
Panhel and Pat Harned, Greek advisor.
Delta Sigma Theta is a national service soror­
ity with members at Chatham College and the 
University of Pittsburgh as well as CMU. Ac­
cording to Johnston, they will not be a voting 
member of Greek Council, although they will be 
allowed to participate in Greek Sing and other 
Greek activities. Delta Sigma Theta members at 
CMU were given special status recognition on 
campus to allow them mailbox and room reserva­
tion privileges, according to Ewald.
Johnston said in a statement, “Delta Sigma 
Theta is the organization which many people are 
viewing as a new black women’s sorority. While 
[theirl membership consists of mostly black 
women, they are non-discriminatory.” Johnston 
went on to say that the local chapter consists of 
women of “many races and creeds.”
Greek Sing scores miscounted
By KENDRICK K. CHUA
Tartan News Editor
Greek Sing scores were mis­
counted this year, according to 
Pat Harned, assistant to the dean 
of Student Affairs. Kappa Kappa 
Gamma’s rendition ofApy thing 
Goes is now ranked second as 
opposed to third place in the so-
that problems with the format of 
the judges’ sheets combined with 
the inconvenience of the blizzard 
the weekend after Greek Sing 
contributed to the error in scor­
ing.
According to Harned, the Greek 
Sing chairs had planned to meet 
on Saturday, March 13, and cal­
culate scores from the judges’
rority division. Likewise, Delta sheets. However, due to trans-
Delta Delta’s performance of Cats 
is now placed third instead of 
second.
“The two chapters who were 
involved took it very well. They 
were all good sports about the 
matter,” said Harned, who said
portation difficulty from the 
weather problems, all the sheets 
were left in the hands of Harned, 
who said that only two people 
were able to go through the scores. 
An error in addition made 
Kappa’s score appear lower than
TriDelt’s, and this error was not' 
corrected until last week.
According to Harned, there;; 
were also scoring problems in last: 
year’s Greek Sing, but that these 
problems were never properly 
addressed. “This year, we knew 
exactly what the problem was. It 
wasn’t some random mistake.”
Judge’s scoring sheets for this 
year’s Greek Sing were divided 
into three categories; musical con­
sideration, showmanship, and 
overall consideration. Each cat- ; 
egory was also divided into sub- ; 
sections. Harned said that the ; 
format will change for next year’s ; 
Sing.
Carnegie Mellon in Brief
ATO appeal of UDC decision rejected
ATO, from page 1
“Further, it is clear that many 
( people who support your chapter, 
j even the vast majority of those 
who received your letter, failed to 
| endorse your appeal. I believe 
; that ATO has a number of con­
cerned and caring brothers, but 
j the chapter as a whole has not 
taken action to control the behav­
ior of a few, in spite of clear warn­
ing of severe penalty.... The Dis­
ciplinary Committee recommen­
dation of January 19,1993, will 
be implemented.”
ATO’s next move is unclear at 
this point. “Basically we’re gonna 
have to talk arid see if we’re going 
, to remain a chapter without a 
house,” said Dee, “and we’re go­
ing to investigate the possibility 
of moving off campus.” An addi­
tional option would be for the 
fraternity to disband.
“It’s a really hard situation,” 
said Harned. “It’s hard for a fra­
ternity not to have a house. You 
lose a place to meet and to have 
social functions. We’re willing to 
do everything we can to help 
them.”
Dee again expressed his belief 
that the UDC’s decision was not 
primarily a result of incidents 
that happened in December, but 
was rather motivated by a num­
ber of past incidents involving 
ATO. “I think that a lot of the 
things that [UDC has] done in 
the past were justifiable,” said 
Dee, “but this is pretty extreme. 
People have said to me that they 
want to make us an example that 
housing privileges are a privi­
lege.”
“I feel that ATO is a victim of 
bad publicity,” said Lutz. “I had 
heard rumors about what ATOs 
were like, but there are a lot of 
good guys there who really care 
about the Greek community.”
Elliott feels that despite ATO’s 
loss of housing, they ought to 
continue to be a'n active part of 
campus life. “I think they should 
take stock of what happened, take 
stock of their chapter, and con­
tinue to be a productive organiza­
tion at CMU. I would encourage 
Chris Dee to continue his leader­
ship role.”
Dee said that this decision 
should serve as a warning to other 
Greek organizations on campus. 
“I guess we’re definitely an ex­
ample as to what could happen to 
a fraternity house,” he said, and 
added that other houses should 
realize that “this could happen to 
them.... CMU would be very one­
dimensional if [it loses] the Greek 
community.” ......
“I’ve talked with some other 
Greeks who have said, ‘We may 
not like ATO, but losing them 
could hurt us all’,” said Bordick. 
He fears that the ATO decision 
could trigger “a chain reaction” of 
measures by the administration 
that would drive other houses 
out of existence.
“As for the Greek community, 
as a whole we’re pretty upset,” 
said Lutz. “A lot of people believe 
that the administration is trying 
to kick us off.”
“This is not a move by the Uni­
versity to get rid of the Greek 
system,” saidHamed, adding that 
the administration has no plans 
to do so, as have some other uni­
versities. She mentioned Frank­
lin and Marshall in particular as 
a college that no longer recog­
nizes Greek organizations.
SDC to recommend 
change in dormitory 
microwave policy
The Student Dormitory Council passed a resolu­
tion last Wednesday recommending that the Hous­
ing Office allow the usage of microwave ovens in 
individual residence hall rooms, according to Chris­
topher Stengel, SDC executive committee mem­
ber. Current policy prohibits the use of microwaves 
in dorms.
Adam Davis, SDC ex-officio, spoke on the micro­
wave policy during last week’s Senate meeting on 
Tuesday. In his report, Davis explained that the 
Housing Office’s rationale for not allowing micro­
waves involved concerns about fire hazards and 
waste disposal in the dorms. Many students are 
known to violate the policy, and the Housing Office 
has previously received complaints concerning the 
ownership of microwaves.
Professor appointed head of History Dept.
Steven Schlossman, a professor of history at 
CMU since 1988, has been appointed as head of the 
Department of History, effective at the beginning 
of the fall semester. Schlossman is currently direc­
tor of the Center for History and Policy at CMU. He 
succeeds Peter Stearns, who is now the dean of 
H&SS.
Schlossman served as a consultant to the Gradu­
ate Management Admission Council (GMAC) since 
1984, and is known nationally for his research in 
the field of policy history. He has also been a policy
analyst at the Rand Corporation in Santa Monica, 
California, since 1979. Schlossman has previously • 
taught at Harvard University, the University of 
Chicago, and the University of California at Los 
Angeles.

FORUM
Mehrabian made fair 
decision on ATO issue
Letters to the Editor
University President Robert 
Mehrabian and the University 
administration made the fair­
est decision possible concerning 
Alpha Tau Omega (ATO) fra­
ternity when they upheld the 
University Committee on 
Discipline’s (UDC) edict that 
requires the fraternity to va­
cate its house on the fraternity 
quad at the end of the semester.
The University was in a lose- 
lose situation. On one hand, if 
¦ ATO was allowed off the hook, 
the administration would look 
weak and unwilling to discipline 
, organizations that fall out of 
line. On the other hand, by pun­
ishing ATO with more than a 
’ slap on the wrist, the adminis­
tration risks the perception that 
ATO is being used as both a 
scapegoat and a warning to the 
rest of the quad. Officially cen­
suring people, groups, organi­
zations, or fraternities reflects 
poorly on the University and, in 
this case, particularly on the 
Greek system.
In the long run, the first op­
tion would lead to an adminis­
tration unable to keep control, 
which would, in turn, command 
no respect. This would be far 
more detrimental to the Uni­
versity than the fleeting disap­
proval of one disciplinary action 
that the second option may or 
may not elicit.
It may appeal’ that the actions 
of the UDC and the administra­
tion were meant to make ATO 
an example to other fraternities 
and organizations. Or it may 
seem that this is just the first 
. shot in an attack on the Greek 
.system. To entertain these 
thoughts would be paranoid. 
The University is not hostile to
Student Government elections 
were held last Tuesday and 
Wednesday, and, as usual, a 
meager fraction of the student 
body turned out to choose those 
who will represent us for the 
next year, although splitting the 
election over two days certainly 
helped the turnout. Though the 
10.8 percent turnout is hardly 
the worst we’ve seen, it is still 
discouraging to see that CMU 
students are so apathetic.
Of course, we feel we should 
note how discouraged the aver­
age voting student must feel 
when he or she receives a ballot 
which has only one name and 
several blank, write-in spots.
However, regardless of how 
much (or how little) our new 
Student Government President 
'David Wolpert or our newly- 
elected senators can trumpet 
their mandate from the cam­
pus, the fact remains that these 
people are now in office, and 
will be responsible for holding 
the fiscal reins of the Activities 
Fee allocation process among 
other important duties.
In the interest of effective gov­
ernment, we would like to urge 
all those elected to office to 
please work together instead of 
against each other. In the past 
year, Student Government has 
suffered the great unpleasant-
the Greeks, exemplified by the 
lenient alcohol and noise poli­
cies that the quad enjoys. ATO 
has not been unfairly punished. 
Although other fraternities 
have broken rules in the past 
without punishment, hopefully 
this happened because the vio­
lations went unnoticed, not be­
cause of a University vendetta 
against ATO.
ATO was given ample warn­
ing, and a generous amount of 
time to attempt to fix its own 
problems, something that the 
University encourages Greeks 
to do. Unfortunately, the house 
was unable to capitalize on its 
opportunities. Apparently, 
ATO was unable to correct the 
destructive and rude behavior 
of some if its members, and has 
been justifiably evicted from 
University housing.
It may not have been the 
University’s intention to make 
ATO a warning to the quad, but 
it will serve to create a higher 
awareness among the fraterni­
ties. The message from the ad­
ministration is that fraterni­
ties should exercise responsi­
bility toward others. This atti­
tude is long due from the ad­
ministration. Greeks must keep 
in mind that with the privilege 
of living in a large independent 
group comes the responsibility 
of controlling the behavior of 
that group.
It is unfortunate that ATO 
must lose its house; however, 
the entire discipline process is 
the most judicious method the 
University can employ. The 
decision is fair and should en­
courage the responsible mem­
bers of ATO to get their act 
together.
ness of having to impeach an 
ineffective president, and has 
suffered from mass resigna­
tions. With luck, and, more im­
portantly, cooperation, our gov­
ernment can achieve something 
that hasn’t been seen here in 
years: a real, lasting impact.
However, this ability to be 
effective is not going to magi­
cally appear overnight. Senate, 
in the past, has shown an in­
ability to cooperate fully with 
the executive branch of Stu­
dent Government. This time 
things must be different. Effi­
cient lines of communication 
must be established early and 
kept open and active. Wolpert 
and the next chair of Student 
Senate should stay in close com­
munication with each other and 
with treasurer-elect Dave Mar­
tin.
Only when the two branches 
of Student Government work 
together will there bean appre­
ciable increase in their overall 
effectiveness and in the cam- 
pus-wide opinion of those who 
have achieved this effective­
ness. Perhaps then we’ll finally 
see an election in which people 
not only desire to run for posi­
tions in Student Government, 
but also one in which a mean­
ingful portion of the student 
body will feel the urge to vote.
Columnist falsely accused 
military personnel
Editor:
I found Declan 
McCullagh’s column 
(“Gay presence threat- 
ens military men’s 
macho image,” 4/5) to 
be a bigoted smear of the military, one 
that vainly attempted to generalize the 
mentality of all people in the military 
based upon a few isolated incidents. 
Particularly offensive was the notion 
that the military culture somehow en­
couraged the Tailhook incident. I don’t 
know any military person that has ex­
pressed anything other than disgust with 
what happened in Las Vegas. In my 
seven-plus years in the military, I’ve 
never encountered any 'extraordinary 
macho, homophobic, or depraved behav­
ior McCullagh will have you believe is 
commonplace and accepted. I would like 
to see the data backing up any of his wild 
accusations.
I invite McCullagh to learn a little 
about the military before writing and 
passing judgment on the 99.99 percent 
that have endearing respect and love for 
all Americans and the Constitution. The 
military, like America, is made up of 
men and women of different tempera­
ments, talents, convictions, races, reli- 
gionb, and ages; however, they have a 
mission that binds them all together. 
Nothing, and I mean nothing, stands in 
the way of the mission. Anything that 
may harm the performance of that mis­
sion is an enemy of all people in the 
military. Changes to the way the mis­
sion is performed must be implemented 
slowly, with training for all personnel, 
with an understanding that mistakes 
might be made, and with intense scru­
tiny so that mission performance will 
not suffer. This devotion to mission and 
normal organizational recalcitrance to 
change is the source of almost all of the 
concern with the President’s proposed 
policy.
Much of the fighting on this issue has 
been fabricated by journalists looking 
for a fight between our President and 
someone or group inside the DC beltway. 
If our President and the Congress lift 
the ban on gays in the military, you will 
not find a group in America that imple­
ments a more fair and judicious policy 
than the military. Ninety-nine and 
ninety-nine one hundredths percent of 
the personnel in the military follow law­
ful orders, whether they agree person­
ally or not; the rest leave the military. 
Nothing stands in the way of the mis­
sion!

Author misrepresented 
sexual harassment case
Editor:
In her column (“Sex­
ual harassment dehu­
manizes women,” 3/
15), Brenadine C.
Humphrey forgot one 
important tiling — to interview the ac­
tual man who was accused of harass­
ment. Not only was the column partly 
fabricated, it was also completely bi­
ased.
I was accused of sexual harassment at 
my job, and it came out to be that I was
innocent of all charges. The female who 
wrote this column only interviewed the 
two females who accused me and filled 
her piece with false information. I was 
appalled. Not only did this hurt me, but 
it bothered all of my friends and co­
workers who knew the true story. They 
were shocked that something like this 
could be printed about me.
I am against sexual harassment and 
do support women’s rights to their full­
est extent. This entire situation simply 
lessens the severity of every sexual ha­
rassment case that will happen on cam­
pus. I am a very friendly person, and 
obviously, my comments at work were 
taken the wrong way. A lot of worse 
things are said in the workplace, and I 
have yet to see anything brought against 
any other workers. The night I was 
quoted to have offended this woman, her 
language to me was extremely abusive 
and vulgar. Was it right for her to treat 
me like a fellow truck-driver? What was 
to come out of this?
I got my job back, and my manager 
realized that I was innocent. Columns 
written in The Tartan should have their 
facts straight. I have actually seen some 
good writing in your paper, but this 
column was written horrendously. The 
author is a writing major for crying out 
loud. I was also offended when the Edi- 
tor-in-Chief told Humphrey she didn’t 
have to write me a letter of apology. Give 
me a break. This is the ’90s. Let’s get a 
grip on reality!

Study abroad program pro­
vides unique opportunities
Editor:
There has been a lot 
of talk about closing 
the CMU Centre de 
Tours, France, not be­
cause the administra­
tion wants to terminate this program, 
but because it’s just not economically 
sound to maintain a program that at­
tracts so little student interest. Over the 
past four semesters of its existence, the 
Centre has had between eight to 15 stu­
dents per semester while its capacity is 
well over 25 students. Too many stu­
dents are missing out on a terrific oppor­
tunity.
Rather than writing about the many 
benefits of studying abroad, we would 
like to talk about some of the opportuni­
ties each of us had by participating in j 
the Tours program. Hereisajustasmall I 
compilation of the experiences that some 
of the past Tours students have had:
• taking a Cessna ride over the Loire 
Valley chateaux with French friends.
• picking a vintage at a local vineyard.
• taking weekend jaunts to London, 
Amsterdam, and, of course, Paris.
• spending breaks at the Olympics, 
the Riviera, and Morocco.
By no means is this list complete. 
Almost every student who participated 
in the Tours program got to experience 
something that they never expected 
when they signed up.
The facilities that are available to stu­
dents in Tours are tremendous. The 
“villa,” or the Centre, is located near the 
center of Tours and serves as a great 
place to hang out with new French 
friends. It is an old mansion that has 
been converted into a student center, 
complete with kitchen, library, class­
rooms, computer cluster, piano, space 
for a studio/dark room, common living 
area, several dorm rooms, and two 
French RAs who are invaluable during 
those first few days. They are there to 
answer the million questions you will 
have.
Now the big financial aid question. 
Since the Tours program is a CMU pro­
gram, dll of your financial aid goes with 
you — federal, state, and any CMU aid 
that you get. This is the only program 
that is open to every CMU student and 
that maintains your total financial aid 
package. Although some other programs 
offer a lower price, the loss of your CMU 
aid will more than likely make up for the 
difference.
If you would like to know more about 
the CMU program in Tours, you can 
contact Emily Bianchini of the Office of 
International Education at x7595 (eb2n) 
or even contact one of us. Regardless of j 
your major, you can take advantage of 
this positive aspect of CMU.

Rape victimizes both men, women
Declan M°Cullagh
Society has finally recognized 
that rape is a terrible crime, one 
fueled by anger and one causing 
severe psychological and physi­
cal damage. Unfortunately, this 
recognition extends only to fe­
males — male rape survivors are 
victims of a lingering social de­
nial.
This disparity is one of under­
lying sexual attitudes. The 
victim’s role is readily applicable 
to women, but society’s predilec­
tions cast a male as the quintes­
sential aggressor. Because there’s 
no room in that definition for a 
victimized man, male rape con­
tinues to be the butt of barroom 
jokes.
But there’s more to the issue 
than social typecasting, for males, 
as a group, are unwilling to ad­
mit vulnerability. Part of this 
reluctance comes from the his­
tory of sexual assault against fe­
males; rape has historically been 
used as a form of social control 
over women and as an unsubtle 
reminder for them to keep to their
place.
Male victims are thought of 
today as female rape victims were 
thought of before the ’60s, when 
female rape was at last recog­
nized as a social problem.
This attitude adjustment was 
spearheaded by the radical femi­
nist movement, which was led by 
authors like Andrea D workin who 
said that all males colluded with 
rapists to maintain a patriarchal 
social structure. Though this far- 
left view didn’t gain immediate 
acceptance, a more moderate one 
eventually prevailed.
A series of psychological stud­
ies in the ’70s provided support­
ing evidence by proving the pair­
ing of sex and aggression. These 
clinical studies showed that rape 
serves primarily non-sexual 
needs, and they differentiated 
between rapes fueled by anger 
and rapes caused by a desire for 
power.
A study conducted in 1979 
showed that almost half of all 
sexual assaults are born of anger 
stemming from the rapist’s flawed 
relationships. These forms of as­
sault are usually not premedi­
tated and are characterized by 
physical brutality and verbal 
abuse.
The other main type of rape is 
an expression of power, with a 
goal of sexual conquest and a
moderated use of force. This type 
of sexual assault was defined 200 
years ago by the Marquis de Sade, 
who wrote that lust is all-power­
ful: “It demands, it militates, it 
tyrannizes.” Sexual assault be­
comes an expression of power, a 
succumbing to the amoral and 
egotistical sexual self.
of attitudes towards rape mea­
sured the level of subjects’ arousal 
when they were shown videos 
depicting three situations: two 
different types of rape and one 
consensual sex scene.
The viewers were most aroused 
when the rape victim was por­
trayed as becoming involuntarily
While there are substantial parallels 
between male and female views on 
rape, an important difference is that 
males continue to believe In their 
own invulnerability....
It’s not only the rapist who sur­
renders to his deviant desires, for 
a good number of people fanta­
size about being raped. However, 
it’s important to draw a distinc­
tion between rape fantasies and 
rape.
Male and female rape fanta­
sies each tend to involve a man 
finding the victim so attractive 
that the rapist can’t control him­
self. But safe bedroom fantasies 
can’t confront the physical and 
emotional pain and psychic 
numbing of an actual rape.
There is evidence that even non­
rapists find this type of semi- 
consensual rape erotic. One study
excited, relatively aroused when 
the sex was consensual, and least 
aroused when the victim was ac­
curately portrayed as abhorring 
the experience.
While there are substantial 
parallels between male and fe­
male views on rape, an important 
difference is that males continue 
to believe in their own invulner­
ability while their female coun­
terparts have always been aware 
of their danger.
This mistaken belief has given 
rise to a lack of nighttime precau­
tions on the part of male college 
students. Says one male GSIA 
student, “I just don’t get close to
people at night. That’s the extent 
of my precautions. I don’t suc­
cumb to paranoia.”
That attitude speaks volumes. 
Males reject the need to take ad­
ditional steps to ensure their own 
security because admitting vul­
nerability repudiates the mascu­
line ideal. In this denial of sus­
ceptibility can be found the dread 
specter of homosexuality. After 
all, thinks our ideal man, that 
kind of thing only happens to 
gays.
Or does it? A recent attack at 
Carnegie Mellon suggests other­
wise. Last month’s rape of a man 
who stepped outside Porter Hall 
to get some fresh air has turned 
some heads.
The answer lies in the redefin­
ing of sexual attitudes. Men and 
women react the same way to 
rape, by blaming themselves. 
They both have rape fantasies. 
They both have been said to bring 
it on themselves. They both are 
victims of a crime committed in 
anger.
Society must recognize that 
rape is not just a crime against 
women; it’s a crime against a per­
son. And every man must under­
stand that it’s not just his mascu­
linity that’s threatened; it’s him.
Declan MfCullagh is a junior 
cognitive science major-to-be.Group attitudes toward women must change
enough so that I can give details about it 
involved students that I used to look up to 
with great admiration. I’m speaking of 
some GSIA masters students, who had 
always seemed to have their lives on the 
path to success. But I will never forget the 
time when I was working in the library 
and at the table behind me were a group 
of male GSIA masters students. They 
were being a little loud, which was annoy­
ing enough. At one point their conversa­
tion turned to who they were going to 
marry—based upon the position, wealth, 
etc. of the potential bride’s father.
Now, I’m sure these students would 
argue that they were just joking around 
and it meant nothing. But from my per­
spective, the comments were said in a 
half-joking, half-serious tone. Even if they 
were joking, people often express their 
true feelings through humor, especially if 
it is a subject that might warrant criti­
cism. I don’t know that these attitudes 
can be generalized to GSIA in general or 
to the University. However, they obvi­
ously exist. And personally, I learned that 
these students are not the great individu­
als I thought they were.
In more general terms, there are other 
examples of groups of men talking. I have 
just begun to realize the set of double

Spring Carnival is almost here. With all 
the preparation and enthusiasm, I’m nev­
ertheless reminded of last year’s incident 
involving a fraternity poster which many 
found offensive. The point of this column 
is not to put the fraternity on trial again 
— far from that.
It is to show that men act and speak 
differently in the context of a group of 
men. The attitudes that poster reflected 
are not singular to Greeks nor any par­
ticular group of men. They are attitudes 
that almost always come out when a group 
of men is conversing.
Several incidents started coming to mind 
regarding conversations that involved 
groups of men. These events have caused 
me to realize that there is still a long way 
to go in terms of improving attitudes to­
ward women.
Perhaps one of the most disturbing, yet 
enlightening, incidents that is discreetStudent government creates little impact on life after Carnegie Mellon
standards that exist in our society with 
regards to issues of gender. One of the 
clearest examples centers on sexuality. A 
group of guys would congratulate and 
glorify behavior by a male that involves 
promiscuity. However, that same group of 
guys would use terms such as “slut” to 
describe a woman who behaved in this 
same manner.
The point is not to pass judgement on 
the sexual behavior. That’s each indi­
vidual’s choice. But for one to make de­
rogatory .comments towards women based 
on these same behaviors is clearly hypo­
critical.
Recently, Newsweek published an ar­
ticle about a group of male high school 
athletes in Lakewood, California, known 
as the “Spur Posse,” a sort of high school 
fraternity, who kept “score” of their sexual 
encounters with women. Girls reported 
having sex with members out of fear they 
would be hurt. Even more shocking is the 
boasting of the fathers of some of the 
members. This further reinforces the point 
that groups of men, or in this case, boys, 
assume a superior attitude toward women.
The main reason I brought these things 
up is to cause people to think about what 
they say or think and how that changes 
within a group context. Men should think
about how their statements change from 
when they’re talking with a group of men 
as opposed to a conversation with a woman. 
And men should speak up if other men in 
a group make offensive comments about 
women and sex, even if such a viewpoint is 
unpopular with the rest of the group. It is 
important that men start disagreeing with 
these attitudes, especially if it does con­
tradict their true feelings.
Many might be saying it’s just a joke, or 
“boys will be boys,” or some other excuse. 
You as an individual might not change 
your behavior or attitudes because of what 
was said. But what about everyone else in 
that conversation? Chances are, a lot of 
people in that group are still shaping their 
attitudes.
This is especially true in a collegiate 
setting. By participating in that conversa­
tion, you have left an impression on others 
within that group. They may adapt those 
impressions and attitudes to their own 
personal behaviors and then pass it on to 
others the same way. Think carefully about 
what you are saying and the attitudes it 
conveys because it affects the larger pic­
ture more than you think.

The Editor’s Notebook
Editor’s Notebook is a feature 
which gives members of The 
Tartan’s Editorial Board the op­
portunity to express their indi­
vidual opinions. Editor’s Note­
book presents the opinions of the 
individual author only, not nec­
essarily the opinions of The Tar­
tan or of the Editorial Board.
In the wake of the “transition” 
in Student Government, I feel 
that the best opinion about any­
thing that won’t drastically af­
fect my future is complete apa­
thy. This is why I did not vote in 
the Student Government elec­
tions.
George Will tells us not to worry 
about the U.S. Presidency be­
cause it only lasts four years. 
Why should we worry about our 
Student Government, which 
changes every semester? People 
resign, people are appointed, 
people change. Precedents are set 
and ignored, and people who ac­
tually make sense and excel at 
their jobs appear infrequently.
If we are to view a university as 
a microcosm representing a na­
tion or some autonomous body, 
then our lifetimes are short and 
°ur citizenship is easily changed. 
We attend this school for only a 
few years, and there’s always the
option of transferring. Graduates, 
especially from CMU, will look 
forward to the real world, which 
is the “afterlife” in our microcosm 
analogy. And whether we go to 
heaven or hell is determined by 
how pious we are in our academic 
exploits. Student Government 
need not be a necessary part of 
our travels. The coin we hand to 
Charon when we leave this world 
need not be tendered by Student 
Government.
This isn’t to say that it has no 
effect on our lives as students. 
Committees like Campus Affairs 
and Acadmic Affairs lobby the 
administration for changes in 
facilities and curricula. The presi­
dent represents undergraduate 
students at Faculty Senate meet­
ings, which often produce healthy 
legislation like the University 
President evaluation committee. 
But very often, these jobs are 
more a product of the people than
the titles. When these people 
graduate, transfer, or find jobs, 
they leave no mark because the 
students who would remember 
are leaving with them. Their suc­
cessors will have little or no idea 
of what the past was like, with­
out the benefit of many years of 
experience which a U.S. Con­
gressman would have in his or 
her position. This makes Student 
Government a fish chasing its 
tail, moving but without progress
as the currents of time carry it 
wherever they go.
I understand now why typical 
students don’t bother to vote. I 
choose to concentrate on my aca­
demics and my activities, which 
will affect my future career and 
my life. Student Government is a 
thankfully temporary burden 
that I will gladly hand down when 
I graduate — as it was to me 
when I arrived.
— Kendrick K. Chua
Recently, the Funding and 
Recognition Committee of Stu­
dent Senate proposed a reso­
lution to Senate that, if passed, 
would recommend to the 
Board of Trustees that it raise 
the Activities Fee $5 per se­
mester. How do you feel 
about the proposed Stu­
dent Activities Fee in­
crease?

Pondering 
life, death, 
lacrosse
How many times have we 
seen the t-shirt that says 
“Donate Blood — Play La­
crosse” or the even more popu­
lar “Co-ed Naked Lacrosse”?
Lots of people wear them, even 
people who have never played 
the game. Lacrosse maintains a 
mythic sort of quality, an aura 
that seems as timeless as 
primordial soup, as if the game 
evolved from the tar-pits a 
million years ago, and was 
there from the minute that man 
walked upright and learned to 
carry a stick.
Imagine the Great White 
North, provinces like Manitoba 
and Saskatchewan, 500 years 
ago. No white man had ever 
stepped foot into what we call 
present day Canada. Imagine 
400 Indians playing lacrosse at 
the same time. Two hundred a 
side. Because that’s how the 
game was played. The Indians 
called it “battataway,” but we 
would probably call it “King of 
the Mountain.” Fatalities were 
common, and each Indian 
proved his bravery by staying 
in the game as long as he could.
In the early 19th century, 
French trappers saw the game 
being played and were so 
mortified by the spectacle that 
they just had to cash in on it. 
Soon, the Indians were coaxed 
into playing in arenas, and 
organized lacrosse was born. 
Still, it was an Indian game, 
presumably unfit for civilized 
men. After all, civilized men 
played hockey.
It was in 1867 that George W. 
Beers codified the rules for 
lacrosse and made it what it is 
today. But most people are 
completely ignorant about the 
game. Someone once asked me 
whether or not gluing razors to 
your stick is against the rules ... 
I’ll have to get back to you on 
that.
Well, when I think of Hell, I 
imagine that it must be some­
thing like a relentless lacrosse 
game, where the damned are 
forced to play for weeks on end, 
and the best players are the 
ones who led the most vicious 
lives. Sure, you’ll see the 
minutes drag by like slugs on 
hot pavement, while the 
taxmen, the lawyers, the 
preachers, the whores, and the 
junkies get their brains bashed 
in by the twisted sticks of 
people like Jack the Ripper,
Ted Bundy, and Big Bird. Am I 
sounding too fatalistic?
That’s because you cannot 
draw a line between life and 
lacrosse. Where does lacrosse 
end and life begin? I’m not sure.
I do know, however, that 
lacrosse is one of the most 
exciting games to watch. Those 
of you who complain that 
hockey is low-scoring would 
enjoy lacrosse’s end-to-end 
action. And there are plenty of 
opportunities to take in some of 
this game right here in the 
Burgh; but before you say a 
thing, put away your credit 
cards — there’s no purchase 
necessary.
Come out and watch 
Carnegie Mellon’s lacrosse 
team. If you’re lucky, you’ll 
catch someone’s dentures.

On a cold, rainy Saturday in April, where’s a 
better place to be than Carnegie Mellon’s Gesling 
Stadium. In the press box, that is.
From my warm, dry vantage point, I was able to 
enjoy the third annual Carnegie Mellon Invita­
tional.
Over 1000 participants representing 20 colleges 
and universities competed in the day’s events.
Sophomore Meredith McKnight was the first 
Tartan to place, in the discus. She finished seventh 
with a throw of 101 feet six inches.
Sophomore Jason Grusky followed with a school 
record-tying throw in the shotput. His 48 feet 4.75 
inches throw earned him a third-place finish.
The men’s 4 x 100 relay team, made up of fresh­
man Kenny Pugh, junior Jarrod Siket, senior Chris 
Maguire, and sophomore Jim Filicko finished in 
fifth place, and junior Cynthia 
Kolanowski took eighth in the 
300-meter race.
In the men’s 3000-meter 
Steeplechase, senior Scott 
Phillips and freshman Matt Beam 
took fourth and sixth respectively.
In the women’s 1500-meter 
race, senior Tracy Howard placed 
seventh with a time of 5:28.76.
On the men’s side junior Jim 
Langer ran a strong third, 1.49 
seconds behind the leader.
Freshman Missy Baustert fin­
ished fourth in the 100-meter high 
hurdles, .02 seconds behind the 
third place finisher.
In the men’s 110-meter high 
hurdles, junior Deron Haley took 
seventh, 1.02 seconds behind the leader, Tony 
Franklin of Indiana University of PA who won the 
event with a time of :15.48.
Junior Mary Moore was the Tartan participant 
in the women’s shotput event. Her throw of 32 feet
9 inches earned her a sixth-place finish.
Graduate student Brad Shapiro was third in the 
800-meter race, running the event in 1:59.29.
It was a tough luck day for Baustert who again 
came in fourth place, this time in the 400-meter 
intermediate hurdles. Her time of1:06.85 set a new 
school record, and was only .55 seconds behind the 
third place finisher. The previous school record 
was 1:07.4, also set by Baustert last week at the 
IUP Invitational.
Another freshman, T.J. Tsangaris was third in 
the men’s discus, throwing for a distance of 138 
feet.
Sean McDowell, last week’s all UAA Track Ath­
lete of the Week, showed why he is worthy of the 
honor by taking second place in the 400-meter

New Orleans? It’s super for Dean, Tar Heels, 
University of North Carolina basketball team
By DARREN CHIAPPETTA
Tartan Staffwriter
Coach Dean Smith should petition the National 
Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) to hold every 
college basketball Final Four in New Orleans. The last 
two times Smith and his University of North Carolina 
(UNC) Tar Heels have traveled to the Big Easy to 
compete for the national championship, they have 
returned to Chapel Hill hoisting the winner’s trophy.
Ironically, the two New Orleans titles, which were 
won by Carolina this year and in 1982, are the only two 
he has won in his career, despite being the all-time 
leading coach in NCAA tournament victories. It is not 
only the fact that the Tar Heels have won, but how they 
have won, which has made it seem as if North Carolina 
is destined to win at the Superdome.
In 1982, with Carolina clinging to a slim lead late in 
the game, Georgetown guard Fred Brown threw the 
infamous “phantom” pass to North Carolina player 
James Worthy, who dribbled out the clock for the Tar 
Heels.
This year, with Carolina up by two and Michigan in 
possession of the ball with under 15 seconds to play, 
Wolverine Chris Webber called a time-out which his 
team did not have. The result was a technical foul 
called on Michigan, and two shots and possession of 
the ball for Carolina.
Donald Williams sank the two technical shots, then 
was fouled on the subsequent inbounds pass and hit 
two more free throws to account for the final 77—71 
margin.
Regardless of Webber’s miscue, this championship 
belonged to the Tar Heels. They played excellent 
basketball all season, and ended the regular season as 
the number one-ranked team in the country. They 
were then upset in the Atlantic Coast Conference 
(ACC) tournament by Georgia Tech.
In spite of this setback, Carolina was still the 
number one seed in the East Regional of the NCAA
tournament. They cruised in their first two games, crush­
ing Rhode Island in the second round by the largest 
margin for a second round game in tournament history. 
They then outlasted Arkansas and Cincinnati in the 
regional semi-final and final, respectively, to reach the 
Final Four.
In New Orleans, the Tar Heels’ first opponent was the 
Kansas Jayhawks. Much was made of the fact that 
Kansas was coached by Roy Williams, a Smith assistant 
for years at North Carolina, although the coaches right­
fully downplayed the personal showdown, opting to throw 
the spotlight on the players.
The Tar Heels most recent Final Four appearance had 
been in 1991, when they were knocked out in the national 
semi-final by the Jayhawks. Many of the current players 
who were on that team said that they were just happy to 
be there in 1991, but that this year, they were much more 
focused on their goal of winning the national champion­
ship.
North Carolina’s biggest strength against Kansas lay 
in the amount of big people they had in their lineup, with 
three players in the lineup standing over seven feet tall. 
They used their superior height to great advantage, 
completely dominating the offensive and defensive 
backboards. Center Eric Montross and forward George 
Lynch led the way on the glass for the Heels, and backup 
center Kevin Salvadori played some quality minutes.
The key ingredient to the Tar Heels’ victory, though, 
was the play of sophomore Williams, who scored 24 
points in the game. His three-point shot with just over 
two minutes left in the game put Carolina up by six, and 
essentially slammed the door on the Jayhawks, who 
didn’t play especially well, but did stay within striking 
distance of UNC for most of the game.
The final pitted North Carolina against the Michigan 
Wolverines, who were making their second consecutive 
appearance in the championship game. Michigan’s “Fab 
Five” were now sophomores, and after defeating Ken­
tucky, who many had picked to win the tournament, in 
the national semifinals, the Wolverines looked primed to
win the national title.
Michigan’s game plan was to make someone beside 
Montross beat them, and they employed double-, triple-, 
and even quadruple-teams against Carolina’s junior cen­
ter. Although Montross scored 16 points, he was not the 
dominating player he had been throughout the tourna­
ment.
However, Williams, who was named the Most Valuable 
Player of the Final Four, continued his hot shooting. After 
missing his first few shots, he settled down and regained 
his touch, winding up with 25 points, including the four 
free throws down the stretch which ended Michigan’s 
hopes of a championship. Lynch had another strong game 
for the Tar Heels, and point guard Derrick Phelps, who was 
hampered by injuries throughout the tourney, did an 
excellent job running the show for Carolina.
For Michigan, Webber had 23 points and 11 rebounds, 
and was a dominating force for the Wolverines. Unfortu­
nately for Michigan, it was not enough, and now fans in 
Ann Arbor will hold their breath and hope Webber returns 
to Michigan for his junior season. He has been considering 
making himself eligible for this year’s National Basketball 
Association (NBA) draft, but after the way the final ended 
for Michigan, and Webber in particular, there may be a 
better chance that Webber will stay in school.
North Carolina will once again be strong next season, 
with the entire starting five returning except for senior 
Lynch, assuming Montross doesn’t jump to the NBA.
The Tar Heels will again tower over opponents, as none 
of their big men will graduate. In addition, UNC has signed 
the player who many consider to be the nation’s top high 
school prospect, Rasheed Wallace, who stands 6 feet 10 
inches tall.
In addition, if North Carolina can make it to the Final 
Four next year, they will have a home-court advantage, 
because the national semi-finals and finals will be held in 
nearby Charlotte.
The Tar Heels will be strong next year, but don’t expect 
them to repeat. That is, unless Smith can get someone to 
move the Superdome to Charlotte.

How I (reluctantly) became a Penguins fan
By ERIC STRAUSS
Tartan Assistant Sports Editor
• Now that the Pittsburgh Penguins have set a 
new National Hockey League record with their 
17th consecutive victory, a 4-2 win over the New 
York Rangers Saturday night in Pittsburgh, I can 
say I was there near the beginning of history, and 
I knew it would happen all along.
Okay, so I wasn’t there in 1967, when the Pens 
played their first game.
*1 wasn’t a Penguins fan when they won Lord 
Stanley’s Cup for the first time in 1992.
: I wasn’t a Penguins fan when I got to Pittsburgh
1 n the fall for my freshman year at Carnegie Mellon.
I wasn’t even there when the Pens beat Boston 3-
2 to start the streak.
My moment of history was at the Pens’ win over 
Washington, 7-5, for the fourth victory of the 
streak. When Mario Lemieux tallied four goals and 
two assists for his first real scoring explosion since 
he missed 24 games undergoing treatment for 
Hodgkin’s Disease, the Pens looked unstoppable, 
and, as it turned out, they were.
But back at that Washington game, no one knew 
it yet. Except me.
1 To help you understand how this miraculous bit 
of prognostication took place, I should probably tell 
you a little about myself.
' I’ve been following sports practically since birth, 
but hockey was never one of my favorites to follow. 
My father grew up scant blocks from Yankee Sta­
dium in the Bronx, and so I am a Yankee fan by 
heredity, if not by choice. Dad still tells me tales of 
the World Series game he saw, and how he was at 
Babe Ruth Day. I, unfortunately, can tell tales of 
seeing Shane Rawley pitch, and Mike Blowers play 
third base.
My team is unquestionably the Raiders. Differ­
ent sport, different attitude, better story. When I 
was a small boy — a month shy of my sixth 
birthday, in fact — my parents, who cannot stand 
football, went out to eat at a restaurant on Super 
Bowl Sunday, 1981. The patrons at a nearby table 
lVad brought a portable television to watch the 
game, and so my parents sent me off to watch. I 
decided to root for the team in white, and they won 
the game, led by Number 16. Ever since, I have 
bteen a die-hard Raiders fan (yes, they wore white 
that day — go figure), Jim Plunkett, number 16, is 
my all-time favorite player, and I hate the team in 
green, the Philadelphia Eagles, more than any 
other team in the National Football League. Yes, 
eVen more than the Denver Broncos.
. In ijchool, I was not a very good athlete. Good 
enough, but nothing special. I played soccer for 
more years than I care to remember, and I have 
heen playing tennis — my mother’s sport — for so 
long I should probably have become one of those 
tennis'prodigies by now.
, Gym class provided me with opportunities to 
play other sports against those with an equal level 
of incompetence, and the one sport I found I was 
good at was hockey. A friend of mine, Dave 
Stoinruck, an ultra-loyal Philadelphia Flyers fan, 
had introduced me to the game during elementary 
school, and by the time we got to play street hockey 
in junior high, I was a solid defenseman. In fact, the 
highlight of my athletic career was the seventh- 
grade street hockey tournament, when 1 scored the 
'game-winning goal in sudden-death overtime of a 
'semi-final game.
>Of course, back then I was — forgive me, Pitts- 
Imrgh — a New York Islanders fan. My favorite 
player to this day is the man all of Pittsburgh
wanted to fade down the stretch this season, Pat 
LaFontaine. I was also a big fan of the Los Angeles 
Kings — I guess it’s something about California 
teams that wear silver and black. So, when the 
Isles traded my main man to Buffalo, a team I 
despise, I chose to root for the Kings.
So what about the Pens, you ask? Well, being a 
Patrick Division man (I still hate the Flyers — too 
much exposure to them as a youth), I always 
respected the Pens for their impressive firepower, 
and like most fans, laughed at them for their 
defense. By the time I was considering college, in 
particular Carnegie Mellon, the Pens were becom­
ing a high-flying team with some major league 
firepower. I kept an eye on them, figuring I’d have 
to root for them some day.
By the time I got here, despite back-to-back 
Stanley Cup championships, I was not about to 
jump on the bandwagon and root for a bunch of 
guys named after an Antarctic bird. So, here I was, 
in Pittsburgh, surrounded by screaming Penguin 
and Pirate and Steeler fanatics, wondering how I 
was going to root for the Kings and Yankees and 
Raiders without getting my head ripped off. Merci­
fully, because the Kings are in a different confer­
ence, the Raiders in a different division, and the 
Yankees in another league, no conflict has yet 
arisen.
By the time I had gotten disgusted with the 
Kings this season, and enamored of the Tampa Bay 
Lightning, I was dating a Penguins fan. Just my 
luck. I’ve gone out of my way to avoid the darn 
team, and here I’ve fallen in love with a loyal fan.
Well, on one of my first dates with Michelle, my 
girlfriend, we went to the last preseason game, 
when the Pens took on Toronto. When I got the 
tickets, I did what my dad always does when we go 
to games: assume the game has high ticket sales, 
ask for the best seats available, and then buy them. 
I figured, the Pens are the two-time Stanley Cup 
champs, I hope I can get decent seats. After all, 
Michelle had never seen a game in person before, 
and my experience was limited to a Hershey Bears 
game four years ago. When I said the best seats 
available, I was hoping to stay out of the upper 
deck. I ended up in the sixth row. Behind the 
Penguin bench. Michelle was in heaven, and I was 
in awe. Hershey had a nice team when I saw them, 
and I’ve seen plenty of games on TV, but nothing 
could have topped seeing Mario Lemieux from five 
rows away, I thought... until I was standing five 
feet away from him.
That’s the final chapter in my conversion, and 
that’s when I became part of “The Streak.”
Louie, the Sports Editor here at The Tartan, is an 
intern in the Penguins’ media relations depart­
ment. Media relations is the field I want to go into 
when I graduate, so I’ve been plugging him with 
questions virtually non-stop since he started work­
ing for the Pens. I was a sports reporter for my 
hometown daily newspaper, The Press-Enterprise, 
but working for a paper in rural Pennsylvania, 
covering high school sports, is nothing compared to 
working for the Pittsburgh Penguins, I figured, so 
I wanted to know everything about the job.
Meanwhile, after six months of going out with 
M ichclle, I’d basically been hearing about the Pens 
non-stop throughout the entire season. I was get­
ting used to it. In fact, I was beginning to like it. I 
would actually look at the Penguins’ score in the 
paper before the Kings or the Lightning. I was 
actually pleased when the Pens beat the Kings.
Finally, one day, Louie got me a press pass for a 
game — the Washington game. I’ve interviewed 
pro athletes before, while working for The Press-
Engineering Students

Enterprise, but talking with a pair of backups, 
Mike Izzulino of the Dallas Mavericks and Bo 
Orlando from the Houston Oilers, is nothing com­
pared to locker room access with the Stanley Cup 
champions.
The game itself was an exciting one, with 
Lemieux, Jaromir Jagr, Kevin Stevens, and 
Michelle’s favorite player, Shawn McEachern, tal­
lying goals for the Pens, while Tom Barrasso made 
several big saves before giving way to Ken Wregget 
after losing his shutout early in the third period. 
He had gotten hit in the knee with a slapshot, and 
with a 6-1 lead, Scotty Bowman wasn’t endanger­
ing his health.
You had to feel sorry for Don Beaupre, though. 
The Caps goalie couldn’t even answer the horn for 
the third period after getting beaten by the Pens in 
everyway possible: breakaway, slapshot, rebound, 
you name it, the Pens scored with it. Wregget and 
Jim Hrivnak, who ironically was the Baltimore 
Skipjacks’ goalie in the Hershey game I saw, made 
the third period a classic duel between backup 
goalies. They both lost. Hrivnak was the victim of 
two goals, and Wregget had what I will be polite 
and call an “off day,” giving up four goals in the last 
fl5 minutes of the contest, including two on which 
he never even moved.
I watched the game from the seats, and I will 
admit to giving up my journalist’s impartiality and 
blatantly rooting for the Pens, chanting and shout­
ing to “Let’s Go Pens!” and that odd song they play 
when players score.
In between periods, I went up to the press box,
and watched people doing the job I hope to have 
someday. Louie, who was kind enough to show me 
around, stopped to get a drink from the soda 
machine in the press box, where I accidentally 
bumped into a gentleman, apologized, and noted 
Louie saying “Hello, Mr. Patrick.”
Mr. Patrick? You mean Craig Patrick? The man 
who some people would call the best general man­
ager in hockey? And I just ran into him?
I could tell I was out of my league.
The best was yet to come, however. After the 
game, like all members of the media, I had locker 
room access. So I grabbed all the souvenirs I had 
picked up, like the media notes, the Caps press 
guide, and the like, and raced down to the base­
ment of the Civic Arena. I got to be at Bowman’s 
post-game press conference, and then followed the 
other reporters into the locker room.
This was not like the locker rooms in my high 
school, mind you. This was a pro locker room, with 
a big screen TV, wood paneling, and what looked 
like a food-preparation area.
In awe of the whole thing, I did what any sane 
small-town journalist would do in a big city: I 
followed everyone else.
That’s how I wound up five feet from Lemieux. 
And Stevens. And Barrasso. I was surrounded by 
real reporters, asking real questions. And then it 
occurred to me that I was one of them. So, I got up 
the nerve to ask McEachern a question. And then 
I ran from the stadium.
The last humorous note is that the Pens have the

tion Desk, the Intramural office, the Athletic De­
partment office, and various locations in the Squir­
rel Hill and Shadyside areas.
These applications are due back to the intramu­
ral office, Skibo Info Desk, or the Athletic Depart­
ment office by Friday, April 23. The entry fee is $10 
for individual competitors and $25 for teams. Off- 
campus fees are $20 for individuals and $40 for 
teams. .
Awards will be presented to the top three finish­
ers among both CMU and off-campus participants

male, Best Male Team, Best Female Team, Best 
Co-ed Team, Best Masters (age 40 and over), Best 
14 and Under, and Best Seniors (50 and over).
Tartans in Buffalo 
Broadsword Tourney
The Carnegie Mellon fencing team travelled to 
the University of Buffalo and competed in the 
prestigious Buffalo Broadsword Championship for 
the first time on April 4-5, attempting to win the 
Jules Goldstein Broadsword trophy. The team fared 
well, finishing third in two events and second in 
another but fell short of the title.
The Men’s Foil team finished second to the host 
school, with the team of freshman Zen Osang- 
thammanont, sophomores Randy Bruno and Brian 
Ondrey, graduate student Chuck Leavitt and alum­
nus Jamshid Mahdavi earning the highest finish of 
the four CMU squads.
The Women’s Foil team of freshmen Cheryl Har­
ris and Joann Truchann, and sophomore Nina 
Liang finished third, while the Mixed Sabre team 
of sophomore Edward Mekhaya, coach Bill Moodey, 
and independent fencer Jeremiah Akbar also took 
third place.
The Mixed Epee team did not place.
Cleveland State, with two first places and two 
third place finishes, won the tournament, claiming 
the broadsword from the University of Buffalo, the 
three-time defending champions, in their first ap­
pearance in ttie championships.
Women’s lax has 
strange weekend
Friday’s rain resulted in a bizarre day for the 
CMU women’s lacrosse club. Playing in a tourna­
ment at the University of Pittsburgh, the team 
wound up playing one and a half games.
According to junior Thomasina Choi, the team 
captain, the team had played about half of its game 
against Pitt when the rains came. After a while, 
the team from Allegheny College asked to play the 
Tartans.
CMU got an outstanding game from its first-year 
goalkeeper, sophomore Beth MacDonald, who made 
several big saves.
“We started out unorganized, but we’re getting 
[into regular season form],” Choi said. “Our de­
fense worked really well together. We just started 
practice on Monday [before the game], and Allegh­
eny started a few weeks ago.”
The Pitt game will be made up on Wednesday, 
and the team’s next contest will be against West 
Virginia University on Wednesday, April 21.
Tartan golf team is 
on winning path
As the changing days of April roll along, the 
Carnegie Mellon golf team sets out each week in 
rain or shine to play its matches.
On Tuesday of last week, the Tartan team de­
feated Duquesne University in its second duel 
match of the season. The score was 417-417 with 
the Tartans getting the victory on account of 
freshman Greg Lassan’s 80-stroke medalist per­
formance.
In the win, juniors Ryan Elliot and Ed Lee both 
shot 82, senior Matt Sullivan shot an 84, and 
junior Nick Ininkenhaus shot an 89.
On Wednesday, they competed in the Spiedel 
Invitational in Wheeling, West Virginia. The Tar­
tans finished second in the field of nine teams with 
a score of 411, beaten only by Westminster’s 406. 
Elliot and Lee came out third and fourth among 
the 54 golfers, shooting 78 and 79, respectively.
The rest of the squad also played well as Sullivan 
shot an 82, Ininkenhaus an 84, and Lassan an 88.
The golf team topped off its week on Saturday by 
competing in the Hiram Invitational at Sugar 
Bush Golf Club in Ohio.
Following a rain storm, the players were left to 
play on a wet course with winds between 30-45 
mph and temperatures between 50-55°F.
Despite the setback, the Tartans were second 
with their four top scores amounting to 336. Lee 
and Ininkenhaus both shot 82, tied for fifth place, 
while Lassan shot an 85, Elliot shot an 87, and 
Sullivan an 88.
Coach, Rich Erdelyi, said “The team is playing 
well, the kids are working hard. We’re a good 
team.”
The team travels to Washington & Jefferson 
College next Monday for the Washington & 
Jefferson College Invitational. UAA champion­
ships are at Emory that weekend.

all Asians, contrary to stereotype, do not look alike. But, there I am, eighteen years old, carrying 
a backpack and wearing a ski jacket, leaving the stadium by the players’ and press exit, when 1 
somebody asks me for my autograph. Go figure.
The point of the matter is, this long process that led to my being a complete and utter Penguins 
fan reached its peak when I realized that the players on the Penguins just oozed confidence. My high 
school is not always the best when it comes to athletics, so I basically had never seen anyone so 
confident about a game before. They were focused, determined, and dead set to win that third 
Stanley Cup. They were the greatest players in the’NHL, and they knew it. It was like, I reasoned, 
they thought they would never lose.
They still haven’t.

Campus awaits Silver Screen — Spring Carnival "93
Diversity shapes Carnival
Booths under 
construction
By TAKA M. SEMAN
Tartan Contributing Editor
It’s Carnival time again. For those 
of you who have never experienced 
Carnival at Carnegie Mellon, you’re 
in for a treat. Here’s a preview of all 
the organizations who are partici­
pating in Booth this year and what 
the themes of their booths will be.
In the fraternity division, 14 fra­
ternities are building booths. Delta 
Tau Delta will be continuing the 
Muppets theme that they started at 
Greek Sing. Kappa Sigma will be 
evoking the spirit of fighting young 
men with “Memphis Belle.” Alpha 
Tau Omega will be putting on the 
gangster persona with “Goodfellas.”
Sigma Alpha Epsilon goes super­
natural with “Beetlejuice.” Pi 
Lambda Phi’s “Dracula” also has su­
pernatural elements. Beta Theta Pi 
goes larger than life with their booth, 
King Kong. If their efforts in the past 
are any indication, then Phi Kappa 
Theta’s “Man’s Chinese Theater” 
should be a sight to see.
Delta Upsilon capitalizes on the 
popularity of Disney’s most recent 
animated release with their booth, 
“Aladdin.” Alpha Epsilon Pi will con­
struct the legendary “Labyrinth.” Pi 
Kappa Alpha will bring the Dark 
Knight to life in their booth, 
“Batman.”
Sigma Tau Gamma will have us 
reverting to childhood with “Pete’s 
Dragon.” Theta Xi will have Carnival 
goers tripping over gophers in its 
booth, “Caddyshack.” Kappa Delta 
Rhogets spooky with “Frankenstein.” 
Sigma Nu will submerge us with their 
booth, “20,000 Leagues Under the 
Sea.”
In the sorority division, four sorori-

Jason Caldeira/Tartan Art StaffCompubookie favors 
Spirit for Buggy win
‘Editor's Note: Compubookie is submitted anonymously every 
year at Carnival time. Not even The Tartan knows 
Compubookie’s true identity. Here are this year's predictions.
Perhaps Sweepstakes 1993 was never meant to be. Bad 
weather once again ensures that every organization with a 
new buggy, and/or a new driver will have to struggle to qualify 
for raceday. In addition, permits, disputes over the number of 
teams, and potholes on the course have caused many problems 
for everyone.
Compubookie is naming the chute as the place to be this 
year due to the inexperience of the drivers. If you are in need 
of scrap material, be there.
Though last year’s races were filled with controversy, the 
fact remains that Spirit walked away with it all. Sigma Nu, 
ecstatic about beating Spirit over the hill last year, is my dark 
horse contender for this year. Their pushers are finally catch­
ing up to their buggies.
For different reasons, ATO, Pi Lam, Kappa Sigma, and ASA 
will not be competing this year. Though none would have been 
strong contenders, their chute antics will be greatly missed.
Compubookie had hoped to see a lot from SAE this year, 
since they had strong finishes last year. However, I’ve only 
seen, or shall I say heard, Limo rolling through the chute. Was 
last year’s great stride enough for two years?
SDC keeps trying to win a place in the top 10, but I doubt 
that they have the pushers and they definitely don’t have the 
rolling machines to make it this year. However, keep looking 
at them in the future.
The Spirit-PiKA rivalry should be easily decided this year. 
With last year’s controversial ending practically forgotten, 
Spirit is ready to again prove to everyone that they are truly 
the best organization on campus. PiKA, on the other hand, has 
apparently given up on their traditional design and has re­
sorted to copying the Sigma Nu teardrop design. I guess they’ll 
try anything once ... or twice.
The women’s races should be very interesting. Theta Xi’s 
victory over PiKA-Theta prompted the brothers of PiKA to look 
elsewhere for pushers.
Their answer: the CMU women’s soccer team. With little 
experience, they should be no match for Theta Xi’s veteran 
pushers. However, don’t forget about Spirit. IfPiKA and Theta 
Xi get caught up trying to beat each other, Spirit will win 
easily.
The rain and snow problems that ruined many a freeroll 
weekend will be to the advantage of the experienced organiza­
tions. They’ll be the ones to watch at the finish line. And for
You’ve been waiting all year for its return, and in just two more days, the single 
event which has rocked Carnegie Mellon since the 1920s will finally be here again, 
Spring Carnival. This year’s festivities, despite a massive cut to the Carnival 
Committee’s budget by Student Senate, promise to be every bit as fun as in past 
years. In fact, over the three days of complete chaos and camaraderie, participants 
can expect to see a more varied and fun-filled Carnival than ever before—especially 
if the sun shines.
Spring Carnival, one of CMU’s oldest and most celebrated traditions, requires 
intensive preparation and planning for all of the events which are a part of it — 
Sweepstakes, Booth, rides, food, music, and special presentations. Members of the 
Carnival Committee began planning and conferencing months ago for this year’s 
event. Finally, after a long process of voting and decision-making among the 
committee and over 25 fraternities, sororities, and other student organizations who 
will be a part of the entire Midway scene, an overall theme was finally reached, 
Silver Screen. “It’s a fun theme,” says Jennifer Gaspari, senior design major and 
Carnival Entertainment Chair. “There's a lot you can do with movies as a central 
theme — people are doing Aladdin, King Kong ... a whole variety of things.” 
Variety almost seems to be the theme of Carnival this year for organizations 
sponsoring events have really made an effort to got the most for their money instead 
of investing in a single event or activity. “Because our budget was cut by Senate this 
year we don't have as much to work with, but we’re not going to let that affect us.” 
“Instead we tried to find entertainment acts which had both quantity and quality 
built into them,” says Gaspari. “We’ve had lots of requests for past Carnival 
performers but we’ve tried to book all-new acts. It makes more sense to get an 
assortmentof acts than the same performors year after year. There is so much talent 
in this area and we’ve really tried to bring a lot of it to campus this year.” 
Freshman information and decision sciences major, and SDC Tent Co-Chair 
Karen Grunberg, also tried to get more of a variety of events worked into this year’s 
Carnival. “Instead of spending all of our money in one place on something like 
balloon rides we spread it out, and this way are able to sponsor more things,” she 
says. “We looked for different kinds of entertainment. We’re sponsoring six di fferent 
kinds of bands — everything from ska to blues to rock. We’re also having karaoke 
Friday night which should be fun.”
“We have been very selective in hiring all of our musical and entertainment acts 
— listening to promotapes and really making an effort to know their sound.” Last 
year, the committee had a problem with a band whose members had pulled down 
their pants during their performance, therefore the committee has been more 
concerned with getting a sense of what each band is all about. “This is Carnival, and 
we don’t want to censor anything. It’s not that we don’t encourage all the public to 
come and enjoy, but we have to keep things clean. A lot of kids from the area will 
be there, so we have to make sure everything’s appropriate,” says Gaspari.
The search for variety has brought several newcomers to this year’s Carnival. AB 
Lectures will be sponsoring KNB FX, a special effects company who will be giving 
a slide show/demo of the techniques they have used in such movies as Misery and 
Dances With Wolves. “I thought it would be impossible to pull off something like a 
lecture during Carnival,” says Matt Adler, senior material science engineering

those who lack the experience and/or organiza­
tion, they’ll be the ones to watch in the chute— 
if you know what I mean.
Compubookie’s views on the organizations:
Beta: Hey Joel, pass the Elmer’s!
CIA: Carnegie Inept Association.
DTD: What’s with that second axle?
DU: Lame duck.
FRINGE: What happened to the cantered 
wheels?
KDR: Copying the wrong organization.
Phi Kap: Big buggies + Big drivers = Slow 
Time.
PiKA: New drivers, new buggies, bad weather. 
Maybe next year.
Pioneers: Consistent. Consistently last.
Kamaoy nonjj/ mnan «ri tcmor
SAE: Was last year’s achievement enough for 
two years?
Sigma Nu: Compubookie’s new dark horse con­
tender.
Sig Tau: Youngster still not ready to compete 
with the big boys.
Spirit: Experienced drivers, consistently fast bug­
gies, and traditionally strong push teams should 
make them the best this year.
SDC: Get a roll bar on that new one guys.
TX: Better luck with their women’s team.
Not competing this year:
ASA: See ya at the conservatory.
ATO: $600 toward beer. What a deal!
Kappa Sigma: Compubookie will give you $10 for 
your aluminum.

Sweepstakes ’93 rolls on with 16 teams
By JENNIFER FORBES
'tartan Copy Manager
' Once again the weather proved 
1:6 be the biggest problem for 
'Buggy this year. While most 
chairs agree the fall semester had 
•excellent buggy weather, the 
“spring semester has been a disas­
ter with a blizzard and lots of 
fain.
Many organizations are wor- 
'rled about whether their buggies 
\vill qualify for race day and were 
counting on yesterday’s rolls to 
qualify many of the buggies.
There are 16 organizations par­
ticipating in SweepstakeB 1993. 
ATO, Pi Lam, and Kappa Sig are 
nil missing from the roster this 
year.
Representatives from ASA, 
Beta, and SAE were unavailable 
for comment.
* The teams are presented in the 
order of their best men’s finishes 
in 1992.
• Spirit 
1 Changes: According to Tom 
Felmley, Spirit buggy co-chair, 
there were some administrative 
Changes during the year but, 
“We’re just trying to put together 
A decent program.”
1 Predictions: Felmley feels that 
the top three teams will be Spirit, 
PiKA, and Beta, but not neces­
sarily in that order. He says, 
“We’ll be up there. Beta is a dark 
horse and PiKA’s been working 
hard, so I really can’t predict.”
Buggies: Sha/ia Zulu, Vicious 
Flow, Tachyon, Quantum Leap.
• Pi Kappa Alpha 
Changes: PiKA has come up 
with a new buggy design that 
according to buggy chair Jack 
DiPiazza is far from traditional.
FREEBOLL'
egade, Desperado
• Phi Kappa Theta
Changes: Russel Elkin, buggy 
chair, says that Phi Kap has 
“placed more emphasis on the 
push team. We’ve really strength­
ened our push team.”
Mark Eggert/Tartan Art Staff
PiKA built two new buggies, but 
their names will not be announced 
until race day. They are listed 
under their temporary names be­
low.
Predictions: DiPiazza also 
thinks that the race will be be­
tween PiKA and Spirit but isn’t 
willing to declare a winner.
Buggies: Race Day 1, Jed, Ren­
Predictions: Elkin believes that 
PiKA will take top honors.
He is not sure how Phi Kap will 
do this year because they have 
not finished qualifying their bug­
gies.
Buggies: Unknown.
• Sigma Nu
Changes: “We’ve built a new 
buggy,” says Scott Francisco,
buggy co-chair, “and made im­
provements to our old buggies.”
Predictions: Francisco thinks 
PiKA will win this year and feels 
that Sigma Nu can make it into 
the top three.
Buggies: The Tenth Command­
ment, KOS, Jama, Colugo
• Delta Tau Delta
Changes: According to co-chair
Dave Berwick, DTD hasn’t chang­
ed too much. “We’vebeen in the 
top 10 and we’re trying to get a 
trophy, but we’re just trying to 
have fun.”
Predictions: Berwick couldn’t 
predict who would win this year.
Buggies: Dark Star, Icculus, 
Perception
• CIA
Changes: “We’ve made a few 
changes to our A team buggy,” 
says CIA buggy chair Jeff 
McMahill. CIA has also added 
new members to its push team.
Predictions'. McMahill expects 
PiKA to win and thinks CIA will 
break into the top 10.
Buggies: Conquest
• Theta Xi
Changes: Theta Xi has a new 
buggy this year. “We’re a lot more 
organized, more levelheaded, and 
ready to go,” says buggy chair 
Tim Minnick. Theta Xi’s new 
buggy has not yet qualified for 
race day.
Predictions: Minnick thinks 
Spirit will be in first place. He 
expects Theta Xi to place one team 
in the top five and two teams in
the top 10.
Buggies: Little Nip, Nemesis, 
Valkure
• Pioneers
Changes: Pioneers has built a 
new buggy. Rick Crotty, buggy 
chair, says, “We’ve got a very fast 
push team this year.”
Predictions: Crotty expects 
Spirit to win. He thinks Pioneers 
will have two teams in the top 15 
and thinks they have a chance to 
win in the women’s division.
Buggies: Hyperion, Turmoil, 
Tsunami
• FRINGE
Changes: Bruce Pollock, buggy 
chair, says that the program is 
“very similar to what’s been run 
in the past.” He notes that there 
was a lot of turnover and that 
FRINGE has several new me­
chanics.
Predictions: Pollock thinks that 
it’s a toss-up between PiKA and 
Spirit. He expects FRINGE to 
have the A team in the top 10 and 
that the B team will be very close 
to the top 10.
Buggies: Genuine Risk, Barrier, 
Junior
• SDC
Changes: Serena Chan, buggy 
chair, says, “This year we’ve had 
more people than ever partici­
pate in buggy.”

break into the top 10 this year 
and possibly even make it into 
the top six.
Buggies: Escargot, Terrapin, 
Banzai
• Delta Upsilon 
Changes: According to Demain
Johnston, DU buggy chair, “This 
has mainly been a building year 
and we’ve made a few changes in 
the program.”
Predictions: Johnston thinks 
the race is a toss-up between PiKA 
and Spirit. DU’s goal is to “make 
it into the top 10 with our A 
team,” says Johnston.
Buggies: Merganser, Gargony
• Kappa Delta Rho 
Changes: “We came out with a
new buggy a few weeks ago,” says 
Mark Fischer, KDR buggy chair.
Predictions: Fischer thinks 
PiKA will win but is not sure how 
KDR will do because their new 
buggy has not been up to speed 
yet.
Buggies: Promiscuous,
Prometheus, Phoenix
• Sigma Tau Gamma 
Changes: Sig Tau has built a
new buggy this year. According 
to Ryan Sullivan, Sig Tau buggy 
chair, “We’ve become more dedi­
cated, the program is being run 
by younger people, and we’ve in­
creased the amount of effort.” 
Predictions: Sullivan thinks 
that PiKA will win. He thinks 
that Sig Tau will make the finals, 
which is “very unusual.” “If ev­
erything goes right, we’ll make 
the finals. If not, we’ll make the 
top 15,” says Sullivan.
Buggies: Spitfire, Vindicator
Carnival promises more variety
CARNIVAL, from page LI
major and AB Chair, “but after seeing 
them perform I think people will like 
them, even if they aren’t a traditional 
kind of act.”
Other new and unusual acts will 
include a Cut-roving jazz fiutist, an 
African folktale teller and the Scratch 
Poets, a music and poetry group.
Most of all, planners have tried to 
schedule events to run smoothly and 
independent of each other.
“We’ve scheduled a half hour break 
between musical acts so the bands can
have time to deal with equipment, have 
sound checks and warm up.
“Last year the performances were over­
lapping and running behind schedule. 
This way every group can have the same 
performance time and things won’t be as 
rushed,” says Gaspari.
“We’ve also tried to break things up 
more and schedule things at different 
times of the day for people who want to 
see it all.”
At this point, it seems the only thing 
which will affect the smooth operations 
of Carnival will be the weather.
“Live [the main concert attraction 
sponsored by both AB and SDC] will be 
outside no matter what,” says Gaspari.
“We were too paranoid about rain 
last year. We’re going to try to keep it 
under the tent instead of in the gym.” 
“Regardless of the weather, people 
are going to have fun,” says Adler.
“You can’t help yourself — the 
workload hasn’t actually changed, but 
Carnival i$ the one time of the year 
people are willing to blow off work for 
three days of fun. It’s going to be a 
blast.”
Practice makes perfect.

Columnist reveals Great Goal Post Capers: Part one
'Schlag’s Nose
by Graham Gibby
After a week off, I return with 
more stories from Ted Fenton’s 
archives. My apologies to all those 
loyal (?) readers who collared me 
and demanded to know where 
the column was. I explained that 
I’d had a really rough week and 
some things are more important. 
And then I asked why they hadn’t 
sent in any questions. (That’s a 
hint, y’all.)
That aside, we jump into a 
wilder (and crazier) yesteryear, 
when Carnegie Tech competed 
against Pitt (and Notre Dame). 
Here’s what happened when CIT 
won, as reported in The Dorm 
Bagpiper, a newspaper that cir­
culated in the dorms and helped 
build spirit. Once again, as with 
the Playboy story, I, myself, can’t 
believe what they got away with. 
I think you’ll see what I mean. Be 
sure to share this one with those 
within “Hey! Check this out!” 
range.
The Great Goal Posts Caper, 
celebrating CIT’s 20 —10 victory 
over Pitt (November 6,1938).
Contrary to stories in the news­
papers, no watchman was slugged 
during the stealing of the goal
posts Saturday night. Neverthe­
less the nine men who went over 
the top for Tech had to show some 
ingenuity before the night was 
over.
They were Earl Ek, Randall 
Burch, Robert Pihler, Dan 
Costello, and C.C. Richardson of 
Welch Hall, Freedman Phillips, 
Charles Klimas, and Walter Botos 
ofScobell Hall, andRoccoMiraldi 
of Henderson Hall.
These men, along with various 
others, left Tech about midnight 
Sunday and went over to the sta­
dium. They met some track and 
basketball men from Pitt and 
amicably went to the Pitt prac­
tice field. There they played touch 
football until the police arrived 
and stopped the fun.
Naturally they scattered to re­
assemble at the hamburger pal­
ace on the corner of Craig and 
Center Streets.
After a light lunch, the nine 
heroes set out again. At the sta­
dium they met a groundskeeper 
who told them that Jimmy 
Hagan, the Pitt athletic director, 
had said that they might have 
the goal posts. So, rather as an 
anti-climax, they walked in and 
took them.
I asked a friend who lives on 
the corner of Craig and Center if 
he thought the White Tower was 
the ‘burger palace¦' described. “I 
don’t know, man — that place is 
pretty nasty. It’s entirely possible, 
though.”Imagine that!
They put the goal posts on the
rumble seat of Costello’s car and 
with the grounds-end dragging 
on the street, rolled back to Scobell 
Hall. Then the boys went through 
the various halls rousing as many 
occupants as possible.
After about 25 fellows had 
gathered on the lawn, they sang 
“Dear Old Tech” and gave “an 
institute” which should have 
waked everyone. An effigy, con­
sisting of one stuffed pillowcase, 
several cardboard boxes and an 
old towel was hung from the goal 
post and decorated with the CIT- 
Pitt score. Meanwhile more fel­
lows were joining the fun. They 
gathered paper, wood, and bro­
ken furniture for a bonfire to be 
held in the street. The police ar­
rived, however, and “suggested”
that the boys move the woodpile 
to the bare space to the right of 
Scobell Hall. By this time almost
200 dorm residents had collected.
When the press photographevs 
arrived, everyone forgot the tire 
long enough to help take the pic­
tures, but suddenly remembered 
when two fire trucks rumbled up. 
A stream of water made short 
work of the blaze.
Next week — Tech Boys Scalp 
Pitt Men! Same plaid time, same 
plaid channel.

Neurotic Living
by Andrew Sproule
I’m starting to realize what is 
wrong with my life. Now, I have 
never claimed to be a genius, but 
even I am stunned at the lack of 
a clue that I’ve had (or not had) 
my whole life. I have no direction 
or goals in my life.
I came to this conclusion after 
realizing all of the seniors that I 
know are graduating. They’re 
going to be accountants, career 
military people, editors, doctors, 
lawyers, politicians, and alien,
life-sucking leeches (no wait, that 
would be the same thing as poli­
ticians). Not all of them — the 
graduates, not the leeches — are 
positive about what they are go­
ing to be doing, but at least they 
have a general feeling about what 
they want out of life. All that I am 
really sure that I want out of life 
is a weight loss program that 
doesn’t require exercise or diet­
ing.
People, for as long as I can 
remember, have been trying to 
tell me to get some direction, and 
get some goals. “Get some direc­
tion, and get some goals, Andrew,” 
said people. As a child, I remem­
ber my father saying to me, “Greg, 
all you need to do is reach for your 
dreams. Don’t be afraid of them.” 
Oh wait, that wasn’t my dad. That 
was Mr. Brady from the Brady 
Bunch. I don’t want you to think
that I never had any goals... well, 
maybe I do. The fact of the matter 
is, the goals that I have had would, 
to some, be considered the an­
tithesis of goals.
When I graduated from high 
school, the only goal that I sort of 
remember having was to drink as 
much alcohol as possible. Trust 
me here, I was very successful. I 
realize that correlation doesn’t 
necessarily mean causation but 
the store that I used to buy booze 
from closed down a year after I 
quit drinking (I’m not kidding).
I don’t know if drinking until I 
dropped was a life-long goal. I 
don’t remember having this con­
versation as a kid, “Andrew, what 
do you want to be when you grow 
up?” “I think I’d really like to be a 
stumbling, confused, blackout 
drunk.” Maybe that’s the prob­
lem.
If I’d known what I wanted to 
be when I was a kid, I’d be on my 
way by now.
Of course, in my family, it’s not 
that unusual to be lacking clue 
as to career goals. My brother, 
Dave, is the only one who pretty 
much knew what he wanted to 
do right out of school — be an 
accountant.
Personally, I’d rather be forced 
to watch the “Ice-Ice baby” video 
by Vanilla Ice over and over again 
for eternity than be an accoun­
tant.
However, at least he had a goal 
and stuck to it and is now suc­
cessful with very few bad hair 
days. I decided to ask him some 
questions in order to maybe get 
some ideas on how to attain goals.
“Dave, how did you, just an 
ordinary guy from Hawaii, go on 
to be such a success in the mind-
Robin Morgan, Ms. magazine editor-in- chief, lectures about “radical” feminism
By HEIDI HOOVER
Tartan Contributing Editor
“I don’t call myself a radical feminist anymore because I’ve 
realized that feminism is inherently radical,” said Robin Morgan, 
editor-in-chief of Ms. magazine Thursday evening when she spoke 
in the Wherrett Room.
The talk, “The New Physics of Metapolitics,” was sponsored by 
the Political Speakers Forum Board (PSFB). Approximately 40
people were in atten- _____________________________________________________
dance — a possible re­
sult of limited public­
ity.
Morgan has been a 
feminist activist for 25 
years and said she 
“came to feminism out 
of the Civil Rights 
Movement.” She is also 
a poet and an author 
whose books include
nuclear testing being done there by Northern countries. The 
women were having “jellyfish babies” — babies with no spines — 
and they made the connection that it was because of the testing, 
said Morgan. So they began protesting. For 20 years they worked 
against the nuclear testing. While they were lying down in front 
of trucks, said Morgan, their husbands were blaming the “jellyfish 
babies” on them — if our baby’s not perfect, you must be a bad 
woman. Finally they made the connection the women had made 20 
years earlier and joined them in protest. Then, said Morgan, it was 
____________________________________________________________ suddenly a po­
litical issue.
“If men do it, 
it’s political. If 
women do it, it’s 
cultural,” she 
said. “If some­
thing bad hap­
pens to a man, 
it’s a tragedy. If 
it happens to a 
woman, it’s
“If men do it, it’s political. If women do it, it’s 
cultural. If something happens to a man, it’s a 
tragedy. If it happens to a woman, it’s melo­
drama. ”
— Robin Morgan
Depth Perception and Death Benefits, which are books of poetry, 
and The Anatomy of Freedom and The Demon Lover: On the 
Sexuality of Terrorism, which are nonfiction.
Morgan, also an expert on international feminism, concentrated 
in her talk primarily on global conditions for women and women’s 
responses around the world.
She also encouraged CMU students to fight for the rights of 
women and people of color here at the University.
“I’d like to leave you with some small vision of connectedness,” 
she said, “some feeling that you are a small part of a giant mosaic” 
of activism.
She gave numbers and facts including: Sixty-six percent of rapes 
on college campuses in the U.S. and Canada are perpetrated by 
fraternity men or in a fraternity setting. Of all the refugees in the 
world, 90 percent are women and children. As late as the 1940s, 
women in the U.S. were being genitally mutilated as a “cure” for 
lesbianism or masturbation.
melodrama.”
What can budding feminist activists do here? “You have your 
work cut out for you here at CMU,” said Morgan. “Demand an 
international, multicultural — ooh, that demon word that upsets 
so many administrations — curriculum. Don’t be afraid to make 
good trouble. If you can crack the aura of fear—of reprisals or loss 
of respectability — you’re on your way.” And remember, she said, 
“[the administration is] scared absolutely shitless (excuse my 
language, but they are) of publicity, so keep the press alive.”
Any well-meaning men who are frightened by feminism or feel 
left out should understand that women’s anger is a high form of 
flattery, said Morgan. As long as women are angry, they still care 
— they haven’t given up. That anger is a sign of love, not a 
“Hallmark when-you-care-enough-to-send-the-very-best-revolu- 
tion” kind of love, but a “furious love,” said Morgan.
Feminism is a long, hard, angry road, but Morgan said, “I have 
never laughed so hard, so long, sometimes so bitterly, but also
She told of women in the Pacific islands who began protesting joyously, as I have with women in the last 25 years.”
numbing world of accounting?” I 
asked. “I like my job,” he said. To 
which I said, “That’s fine, but 
how did you get to that point?” “I 
like my job,” he said. “That’s great, 
what’s wrong with your voice? It 
sounds like it’s cracking.” “I ... 
like ... my ... job,” he said. Why 
was he shaking? “How do you 
come to grips with the fact that 
you are going to wake up every 
morning, day after day, year af­
ter year, doing the same number 
crunching again and again with 
no respite in sight? Hey, Dave? 
Dave? Are you crying?” So much 
for that interview.
I wanted to be a rock star and I 
still think that wouldn’t bo too 
bad. I’m just missing the one thing 
that would help me attain that 
goal — the talent.
I think that I’m running out of 
options. I’ll be 27 years old in one
week and two days (Remember to 
mark April 21 on your calendars, 
I’m registered for gifts at all ma­
jor department stores), and I’m 
still not sure what I want to do. 
I’m afraid to take one of thos§ 
career placement tests because 
I’m not sure I could deal with the 
results: “Well Mr. Sproule, our 
tests show that you’d be perfectly 
placed in the tourist industry.” 
“What do you moan tho tourist 
industry? Like a hotel manager, 
or my own travel agency?” "Not 
exactly, more like tho manager at 
the mud museum in Arkansas, or 
Ernie’s reptile zoo and pancake 
house in Florida.”

MUSICAL ACTS PfPFOPA AT CfiPHIVflL
Many bands to play at the Tent
By JENNIFER URSO
Tartan Photo Editor
Aside from all the parties, games, 
people, and booth and buggy stuff going 
on at Carnival, I know that what I’m 
looking forward to most is the musical 
acts. I realize that I’m a music buff but 
being able to see 16 bands over a course 
of three days for free is pretty cool for 
me.
Of course, it’s not really free. It’s 
covered by our Student Activities and 
dormitory fees, which is OK, because I 
won’t have to dig around in my pockets 
for money like I had to for Pigface, King 
Missile, and last Sunday’s Meat Beat 
Manifesto/808 State concert. So let me 
rephrase; it’s not “free,” it’s “been taken 
care of.”
Here’s a look at some of the bands 
who’ll be playing the Tent this Carnival.
Live
If you haven’t heard people muttering 
it to each other already, Live is the 
headlining band for this year’s Carni­
val. A kind of odd choice considering 
that their last album, Mental Jewelry, 
came out in 1991, but a good choice) I 
think. Live is mainstream enough so 
that enough people have heard of them 
but not so mainstream that, say, people 
in my high school would know who they 
are.
From what I know from their last 
album, their music’s fairly mellow mod­
em rock and has a sort of “oh, um, maybe 
we should listen to the lyrics” type feel­
ing.
Ironically enough, the lyrics are some
the darkness to. In other words, it’s 
pretty thought-provoking stuff.
So I’m hoping that this show won’t be 
like a lot of concerts I’ve been to where 
people hop up and down because of their 
lack of dancing ability. Hopefully, it’ll be 
a show where I can do what I love to do 
— move a bit and appreciate the music. 
And hopefully, if the world just happens 
to be functioning right, everyone else 
will learn to dance well to a band that 
completely deserves all of the attention 
it’s going to get on Friday afternoon at 2 
pm.
Skablins
Another one of the bands playing over 
Carnival who I believe is fully notewor­
thy is the Skablins. I saw these guys for 
the first time when they played the Bee-
Band to offer Wretched sound
See lemmings 
fall off cliffs

courtesy of Radioactive Records 
pretty serious stuff. Considering that 
the oldest member in the band is 21, 
they had a completed album before they 
were even signed, and have songs that 
have to do with unifying feelings, not 
feeding your children ideologies, and 
re lying on yourself to solve internal prob­
lems, I would say that this band has 
done a hell of a lot and that now I feel like 
a speck of complete nothingness.
Live is good music to jog to, drive to the 
beach to (not that we can quite do that in 
Pittsburgh), and open your windows on 
a warm summer night and stare out into
hive in Oakland (when the Beehive was 
still having shows). They played a packed 
room for only about a half hour because 
the opening band hogged all the time, 
but for the short amount of time they 
were up there they generated the same 
amount of energy in me and all my 
friends as a two-hour-long show would.
They also played at the Beaux Arts 
Ball to a packed room and ended both 
shows with their own version of “Rain­
bow Connection.” Now I’m not even sure 
if I can remember the actual version of 
that song after the Skablins’ heavy in­
fluence.
If you want to hear good, fairly hard 
ska, but not as hard as the Mighty 
Mighty Boss Tones, definitely check 
these guys out.
I think the number of people in the 
band has changed since I saw them at 
the beginning of the year, but as far as 
I’m concerned, their sound hasn’t 
changed. They still bring up this incred­
ible urge to dance and hope that the 
show isn’t going to end.
To hear them, be at the Tent on Satur­
day from 3-4 pm.
The Karl Hendricks Trio
The Karl Hendricks Trio, a local band 
who’s played around the Pittsburgh area 
several times and who’s aired frequently 
on WPTS and WRCT will be playing on 
Thursday, from 6:30 to 7:30 pm in the 
Tent.
This band has that whole grunge/ 
please see BANDS, page L8
By KATHY JO KRAMER
Tartan Junior Staffwriter
The music of the Little Wretches has 
been heard all over the world and re­
ceived critical acclaim from Norway to 
Milwaukee. The Pittsburgh Post-Gazette 
called their first CD Just Another Nail 
in My Coffin “the most powerful body of 
work to emerge from the Pittsburgh 
area since time began.” And the Post- 
Gazette gave their second CD, Beyond 
the Stormy Blast, the only “A+” rating in 
the paper’s history. Other city publica­
tions, as well as many local radio sta­
tions, offer praises. A few weeks ago, 
they were featured live on WDVE’ s 
“Coffeehouse” segment and a few weeks 
ago, they did a live, one-hour show on 
Rock 97.
And no wonder. The music inspires — 
no, it insists that you dance, while the 
lyrics demand that you listen. “Walking 
Among the Buildings,” from Beyond the 
Stormy Blast, begins with a steady acous­
tic guitar and an occasional bass drum, 
sounding like a can being kicked down 
Main Street. You have to kick it a little 
further each time, even though you know 
you can’t. This is working-class America. 
Your pace quickens, as does the song’s. 
One night, Bam! all your trying goes 
into one precise kick and Bam! the can 
goes crashing into Mrs. Cleaver’s wind­
shield.
Robert A. Wagner, the band’s founder, 
describes a Little Wretch as something 
that’s born the moment you decide you’ve 
had your ass kicked for the last time. 
Wagner picked up a guitar instead of a 
club: “When I was a boy, my heroes were 
Popeye the Sailor Man and Mighty 
Mouse. Later, I liked the Beatles. I fig­
ured I would be happiest in life if I could 
play in a rock ‘n’ roll band that went 
around beating up bullies.” He named 
the band while watching a French film, 
400 Blows. Some kids in the film stole 
something and a shopkeeper yelled, 
“Hey, you little wretches.” Wagner 'fig­
ured, “Hey — that’s us.”
Their music is dissonant, dark, beau­
tiful, in a word, evocative — with the 
spirit and cunning of a kid who cuts 
school and writes his own excuse, a little 
wretch too cool to be seen carrying a 
book that he’s memorized. In order to 
describe the music, I’d have to list all the 
influences (from the Velvet Underground 
to Elvis), but it’s the way they combine 
these elements that gives them their 
own sound. The result is the feeling that 
you’re seeing and hearing music being 
made, not just played.
And even if describing it seems to 
require hyphenations, the band’s vision 
doesn’t. In the ten years that they’ve 
survived, (three members have died) 
their message remains as an emblem of 
their history: they may never win, but 
they’ll never quii. Too much rock music 
has a contrived sense of aggression tar­
geted to teenagers who haven’t gotten 
over the fact that they have to clean
their rooms. The Little Wretches don’t 
exalt a certain revolutionary conscious­
ness to be cool — theirs is real and 
grounded in compassion, not contempt.
The band’s latest music reflects the 
resolution of the anger of youth into the 
acceptance of adulthood without com­
promising the save-the-world desire that 
earns ridicule instead of praise in a 
world offering little more than obstacles 
and excusos. They’ve been called a work­
ing-class band, but they don’t romanti­
cize the working class; instead, they 
supply the encouragement to overcome 
the limitations of any class or classifica­
tion by offering a hope that defies the 
angst of being raised in a city where 
fodder for the steel industry is being 
channeled into college. The music is 
working class in diction, but not in vo­
cabulary; in its traditions, but not its 
values. As Wagner says, “it isn’t pretty 
rock.” “Whether You Like It or Not,” 
from their newest CD, encapsulates this: 
"The walls are shaking and the wind 
utters a cough / The electric light is buzz­
ing and it flickers on and off land mari­
juana smoke is rising through the venti­
lation... /so you tally up your assets/and 
buy about a gram of something sure to 
make your ass sweat...”
Wagner exposes happy-ever-afters as 
being once-upon-some-lie’s. The lyrics 
are as honest as the crack of a baseball 
bat on bone: “If you want to plan the 
perfect murder, give a working man a 
wife.” (from “Working Class Hero,” on 
their Born With a Gift tape.)
The members of the band have all 
played music since they were little, and 
all of them wanted to be drummers ex­
cept Wagner, whose first guitar was 
made out of some scrap wood, nails and 
rubber bands. Dave Losi sings and plays 
guitar and keyboards; he also writes 
many of the band’s songs. He was born 
in Germany but lives in Bethel Park. A 
jazz-vocal graduate of Duquesne Uni­
versity, he performed “Route 66” and 
“Seventh Son” at his senior recital, rais­
ing a few elitist eye brows. Wagner says 
that when he hears Losi sing, he feels 
like he should be paying to listen. Ellen 
Hildebrand plays bass and sings. She’s 
also a new mom. She and her husband 
run a sheep farm in Green County, the 
business headquarters for the band’s 
own record label, Bam! Bam! Records. 
She attended college on a basketball 
scholarship, an experience which taught 
her endurance and resilience — hall­
marks of a Wretch. She auditioned for 
the band with a pawnshop guitar and 
primitive skills but has become a strong, 
solid player. The band’s new drummer is 
Doug Laskody, also from Green County. 
He was rescued by the Wretches from 
the rural wasteland of country road­
houses and cover tunes.
So what is a Little Wretch? Wretches 
are the first generation of Americans 
raised on TV, and sick of apologizing for 
it. The first generation raised for war

If you find yourself tiring of all the 
Carnival hubbub, are suffering from 
computer withdrawal, or are just plain 
addicted to saving those lovable lem­
mings from doom, you’ll probably want 
to stop by Wean 5419 cluster this Friday 
between 6 pm and 2:45 am to check out 
the first ever collegiate Lemmings tour­
nament.
The tournament is sponsored by KGB 
and Psygnosis, the creators of Lem­
mings. The idea for the contest came 
about when KGB member Amy Mc-Gov- 
ern suggested getting a group of KGB 
members together to play Lemmings. 
In an attempt to gain license to several 
copios of the game for a few hours, 
Psygnosis was contacted. Manager of 
Marketing Phil Sandock liked 
the idea so
ho offered to 
prizes and to 
Pittsburgh

For the

Lemmings is a game whoso objoct is to 
save as many lemmings as possible in 
order to advance to further levels. Un­
like most computer games, which rely 
almost solely on hand-eye coordination, 
Lemmings requires thought and skill to 
advance from level to level.
In true suicidal-lomming style, the 
little lemmings walk blindly in what­
ever direction they might be facing, 
which usually results in death if you 
don’t save them in time. The lemmings 
must get through various obstacles be­
fore you can get them safely to the end 
of each level, trying to avoid having 
them fall off cliffs, bridges, or into the 
water.
You select specific lemmings to do 
special tasks to help the others from 
falling to their doom, such as bridge- 
builders, diggers, parachuters, etc. If 
you get really desperate, you can always 
blow them up, allowingyour frustration 
to vent itself as an entire swarm of 
lemmings explode into the landscape 
like a bunch of popping corn. As you

SCOTCH T1- SODAS n 0 ,p,oy, ’o jf60ghf4’’fOlVfS flUDIEIKE THE fDEEDOM Of CflOICE
By TINA L. URSO
[ Tartan Diversions Editor
While you’re checking out all 
the various and assorted Carni- 
[ val events, you’ll want to make 
! sure you stop by the Ballroom 
j Thursday, Friday, or Saturday 
at 8 pm for Scotch ‘n’ Soda’s pro­
duction of The Mystery of Edwin 
Drood. Besides singing and danc­
ing this year’s show offers some­
thing new for the audience: free­
dom of choice.
Remember those Choose Your 
Own Adventure books from our 
junior high days? Or, better yet, 
that interactive Clue movie that
came out on video? You got to 
choose what would happen to the 
characters; your fate and theirs 
was entirely in your hands.
Take this neat concept, add 
some music, put it on the stage, 
and you’ve got The Mystery of 
Edwin Drood, except this time 
even the actors don’t know how it 
will end, and you can’t read the 
book from the back forward to 
find out what'll happen.
The musical was adapted from 
an unfinished Dickens’ novel by 
Rupert Holmes, and won a Tony 
for its Broadway performance in 
New York. Drood is really a play 
within a play that’s performed 
by members of the London Music 
Hall Royale in 1892. Each Scotch 
‘n’ Soda actor plays two roles, 
one as a Music Hall actor and one
as the character their Music Hall 
counterpart plays.
The Music Hall play follows the 
Dickens’ story and ends halfway 
through the second act (right
*
é
Kevin Chen/Tartan Phtotgrapher 
Jeff Kunin and Andy Folmer rehearse for fvcckD
where Dickens stopped). At this 
point, the audience takes a vote 
on three things: the murder, the 
identity of the detective, and who 
should fall in love. The tally of 
these votes de­
termines how 
the play will end. 
There are over 
300 possible 
ways the
evening’s perfor­
mance will end. 
After the votes 
are tallied, only 
one actor will 
know how the 
play is supposed 
to end. When the 
moment of sus­
pense is released 
on stage, it’s as
much a surprise to the actors 
(including the one who ends up 
being the murderer) as it is to the 
audience.
In between the scenes of the 
play-within-a-play, the Music 
Hall actors have to face a series of 
trials as they are always prepar­
ing for a premiere performance.
In this Scotch ‘n’ Soda perfor­
mance, directed by sophomore 
directing major KristieAnne 
Reed, sophomore English major 
Vivien Weiss plays Music Hall 
actor Alice Nutting (as Edwin 
Drood), sophomore H&SS student 
JeffKunins plays Clive Paget (as 
John Jasper), and junior chemis­
try major Andy Folmer plays the 
Music Hall chairman, William 
Cartwright.
This Carnival’s performances
promise to be exciting and a lot of 
fun. Stage manager Stephen 
Simon says that this production 
should be perfect for the Carnival 
atmosphere because it’s an up­
beat sort of play and very audi- 
ence-participation oriented.
So what more do you need? If 
you don’t think this sounds like a 
must-see for Carnival, you prob­
ably wouldn’t have read this far. 
Tickets are only $5 ($4 with CMU 
ID) at the Info Desk or in front of 
Doherty Tuesday through Thurs­
day from 10 am to 5 pm. At this 
price, you could probably afford 
to see all performances (remem­
ber, the show will be entirely dif­
ferent each night). Besides, when 
else in your life are you going to 
get the chance to help decide 
whodunnit in a Dickens’ story?

Due to Carnival, there will be no Saturday night 
film this week.
Thursday, April 15
Cape Fear (1962)
No, this isn’t the one with Robert De Niro 
torturing Nick Nolte and his family. This is the 
original with Robert Mitchum as the psycho and 
Gregory Peck as the father. Mitchum gets out of 
jail after 14 years and blames his incarceration on 
his lawyer, played by Peck. He then begins to 
track down, harass, and plan an evil revenge on 
Peck and his family.
This version may not be as explicit as the 
modern version, but it still gives you that eerie 
creepy feeling up your spine. It’s based on the 
novel, The Executioners by John D. MacDonald 
and also stars Telly Savalas, J. Lee Thompson, 
and Martin Balsam.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Body of Evidence
Hey wow, Madonna’s having sex with someone, 
except this time, she does it with an old guy and 
he dies. So Willem Dafoe (Mississipi Burning, The 
Last Temptation of Christ) defends her as she goes 
on trial for manslaughter. But guess what? She 
has kinky sex with him, too.
Maybe the goal in this movie is to find out who 
she’s not having sex with, or maybe it’s to find out 
whether or not it’s really her fault that an old guy 
with a heart condition died while having kinky 
sex with Madonna. Well, maybe she’s not only a 
sex maniac but also a murderer; but then, that’s 
what the movie’s about.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

High School Confidential!
Well, the’usual guy isn’t here to write this so 
I’m going to give it a try.
It’s yet another strangely bad movie with 
people smoking lots of pot. A young, undercover 
agent (Russ Tamblyn) gets evidence against 
some dope pushers.
Another totally intelligent attempt to make a 
film (note the sarcasm). But see it anyway be­
cause it has a really cool cast with Jan Sterling, 
John Drew Barrymore, Jerry Lee Lewis, Charles 
Chaplin Jr., and Michael Landon (of Highway to 
Heaven fame).
And see it also because you need to see some­
thing funny before having to go to classes on 
Monday.
At 6, 8,10 pm, and midnight.

Comic Ecke
by Kendrick K. Chua
I’m sitting here, hunched over 
the word processor in a dark, 
lonely office with a press kit and 
a month’s worth of comic books 
trying to figure out how I’m going 
to compress 15 years of the Warp 
Graphics comic book Elf quest into 
11 inches of text if I didn’t even 
experience all of it myself.
It’s one of the few comic books 
that deserves to be called avant- 
garde. Elfquest has art that falls 
somewhere between caricature 
and reality, and dialogue that 
blurs the line between fantasy 
and absolute truth. The stories 
have their share of action and 
adventure, as well as deep char­
acterization. And it is, without 
question, the leading independent 
comic book.
And that is my futile attempt 
at a 15-year timewarp on paper.
Elfquest, the artistic product of 
husband-and-wife team Wendy 
and Richard Pini, is celebrating 
its 15th anniversary with two new 
titles on the market, subtitled 
New Blood and Hidden Years. 
Unlike previous Elfquest series, 
the Pini’s have taken their “fan­
tasy with teeth” stories and given 
loose plotlines and dangling 
pieces of the past to other writers 
and artists to expand the world of 
the elves, the world of two moons.
It’s difficult to sum up exactly 
what jElfquest is about. Obviously, 
the main characters are elves,Bands perform
BANDS, from L7
gajust starting out but already 
have a set of songs they wrote 
themselves. Aside from that, they 
also do some interesting rendi­
tions of songs like “Staying Alive,” 
“Iron Man,” and Pearl Jam’s “Still 
Alive.” Besides playing awesome 
music, they’re entertaining be­
cause they’re funny, original, and 
have lead singers with actual 
good voices. It’s no wonder to me 
that Boot Skootin’s getting to play 
the Tent. They’ll be there on Sat­
urday from 12 to 1 pm. 
WRETCHES, from L7 
but given no enemies. The first 
generation who won’t do better 
than our parents.
We watch love-making be the 
source of epidemics and deadly 
disease. And we’re not going to 
take it.
The Little Wretches will be per­
forming at Carnival on Saturday 
at 7 pm on the Corner Stage.
but there the obvious things stop 
rather abruptly. With any other 
comic you could say “Our hero X 
must defend Y from evil thing 
foo,” but that generalization 
doesn’t hold in Elfquest. There is 
no good and evil defined so clearly, 
and the morals of the many char­
acters are not so easily applied.
The elves struggle 
against many obstacles 
trying to live out their 
lives peacefully. They 
have ongoing conflicts 
with the humans and 
trolls who co-habit their 
world. They sometimes 
fight amongst them­
selves, as the Wolfrider 
and Sun Folk clans clash 
over ancient pieces of 
their heritage and reli­
gion, and their common 
descendance from a race 
of elves known as the 
High Ones. And the 
elves have always lived 
with mysticism and 
magic. With this loose 
format, the Pini’s have 
delivered surprisingly 
consistent and engag­
ing plots that have 
taken the elves all over 
their world, on quests 
for life, defying death, 
and discovering them­
selves.
The art, like the sto­
ries, has no real edges.
Wendy Pini draws human beings 
realistically but without the ana­
tomical perfection you see in most 
comic books. Elves look almost 
cartoonish, with oversized eyes 
and pointed ears. And the trolls 
look positively distorted and un­
real. But put one of each side by 
side and you can’t see how they
couldn’t come from the same 
world. Now put them in a forest 
or desert setting, in a world barely 
coming out of its iron age, and 
you have a rich, pseudo-medieval 
setting that appeals to the eye 
and holds the potential for many 
an epic story.
One of Elfquest's biggest sell-
Yearling than Batman, more like 
fine literature than children’s 
entertainment, which is probably 
why you can take a course at 
SUNY Buffalo called “Elfquest: 
An excursion in contemporary 
myth.”
The current issue of Elfquest: 
New Blood tells the story of a Sun 
Folk elf who falls in love 
with a female Wolfrider, 
and how their customs 
and their genders col­
lide. The current issue 
of Elfquest: Hidden 
Years is the first of a two 
part story about the 
struggle of the High 
Ones and the origin of 
the human race on the 
world of two moons.

ing points is that it doesn’t ap­
peal primarily to the pre-adoles­
cent male audience that most 
comics do. The strongest stories 
yet told in these new series in­
volve coming of age, family, and 
false male-female stereotypes. 
This narrative angle makes 
Elfquest sound more akin to The© 1993 Warp Gr;KGB, Psygnosis sponsor tournament
LEMMINGS, from L7
three. Teams sign up for one of 
four 80-minute time slots, after 
which the three individual scores 
will be added up for a team score. 
The top four teams from each 
time slot will advance to the 
championship tournament held 
towards the end of the event, 
from which the final winning 
teams will emerge.
The top prize is a copy of Lem­
mings for each winning team 
member; second- and third-place
teams will win Lemmings t- 
shirts. Various door prizes will 
also be given away throughout 
the event. In addition, demo cop­
ies of other Psygnosis games for 
Macintosh will be on hand for 
anyone who wishes to try them 
out.
Compute magazine has called 
Lemmings “the most addictive, 
puzzling, and entertaining com­
puter game released in the last 
five years.” If you haven’t found 
this out already, you’ll want to
stop by Wean 5419 on Friday 
night and find out what you’ve 
been missing.
Or, better yet, you could even 
enter. Applications can be found 
in this and last week’s issue of 
The Tartan, and are due by mid­
night Tuesday. So if you like to 
play Lemmings, or if you’d just 
like to come by and watch the 
lemmings get saved from their 
impendingdoom, stop by the tour­
nament for a few hours on Fri­
day. It should be a lot of fun.

death of one of them on a teenager.
Gee, I wonder if they’ll eat him or take him on •

better yet, do the cliché trying to take over the !

see this movie. I mean, it’s only a dollar, so what
