Traffic Through Campus: What’s Been Done
Other areas the committee investigated 
were the intersection of Forbes and Devon 
(opposite Skibo), Margaret Morrison Street 
in front of Donner, and the intersection of 
Margaret Morrison and Tech Streets (where 
the new Stop signs are).
In May, the Senate committee, in 
conjunction with Sr. VP for Business 
Affairs Fred Rogers, submitted a request to 
the City Department of Public Works, 
showing how future accidents could be 
prevented. At the Forbes and Morewood 
intersection, the report recommended that the 
time allotted for pedestrians be increased, and 
that this time be included in the cycle at 
night, without requiring pushing the button. 
It also requested that additional Speed Limit 
signs be put in, with flashing yellow lights.
On Margaret Morrison Street, the report 
asked that the City install five Stop signs: 
three at the Donner bend (where the hill 
dorms access road meets Margaret Morrison), 
and two at the Frew Street intersection. To 
reduce the hazards of the 90 degree turn at 
Donner Hall, it recommended that No 
Parking signs be put up (where the curb is 
already painted yellow) to eliminate the blind 
curve, and arrows showing approaching 
drivers that there is a sharp turn ahead. The 
report also asked that more Pedestrian 
Crossing and Yield to Pedestrian signs be 
installed on both Forbes and Margaret 
Morrison, and that all crosswalks be 
repainted.
Director of Public Works Louis Gaetano 
agreed at that time to implement many of
the suggestions. He told them that Devon 
Road does not warrant a stop sign, and that 
neither of the sites on Margaret Morrison 
constitutes an intersection. For Frew Street, 
he was able to bend this definition, so as to 
be able to put up Stop signs, but there 
would be no way to do this for the Donner 
turn. He said that the changes that could be 
made would be made by the end of the 
summer.
Nearly seven months later, two Stop signs 
were put up at the intersection of Margaret 
Morrison and Tech Streets, in front of 
Margaret-Morrison Carnegie Hall. Glenn 
Kombrek, current Chairman of the Senate 
Campus Affairs Committee, said he was 
happy that the Stop signs were installed, but 
he wants the city to do more.
Matt Walsh, Supervisor of Traffic 
Controls, stressed that Speed Limit signs 
must be posted frequently enough. About 
the blind curve on Margaret Morrison, he 
said that if there is a no-parking zone (which 
there is), he will put in No Parking signs, 
which CMU Chief of Police Pampena 
claimed would allow the City Parking 
Violations Bureau to ticket cars parked there. 
Walsh also said that he would be willing to 
repaint the crosswalks, and possibly even add 
some, but pointed out that he can not have 
painting done until there is a thaw, as the 
paint will not dry correctly at temperatures 
below 40 degrees. Walsh offered to meet 
with the interested parties to examine the 
streets in question. More plans are in 
progress.
Center Established at CMU
Greeks Sponsor Blood Drive
BY KAREN WOODILLA
Tartan Staffwriter
The Inter-Fraternity Council has 
arranged for Central Blood Bank to 
collect blood from the CMU 
community today and Wednesday, 
January 28, from 11:00 a.m. to 6:45 
p.m. in Skibo's Wherret Room.
"We're replenishing our blood banks 
after the holidays. We're coming out 
of a critical stage, when we had to 
cancel elective surgeries at area 
hospitals," said Dave Edmunds, a 
Central Blood Bank Field 
Representative. The Central Blood 
Bank provides all the blood for 32 area 
hospitals.
Pittsburgh Radio deejays Quinn and 
Banana will entertain at the blood drive 
today. The organization with the 
greatest percentage of participation in 
the blood drive will receive free DJ 
entertainment, or cash equivalent.
Early next month, each CMU 
fraternity and sorority will use one 
telephone for a "Sprint Night" at the 
Alumni Relations office at 5017 
Forbes. Greeks will call people on 
special lists and urge them to pledge 
blood sometime during 1987. They 
will repeat the procedure at the Central 
Blood Bank office in March. Central 
Blood Bank staff will contact pledged 
blood donors during the year to 
schedule convenient times to donate 
blood. The house which solicits the 
most blood donors will earn $1000.
Pi Lambda Phi fraternity worked for 
the nationwide Cerebral Palsy telethon 
on January 18, from 2am - 7am at 
WTAE Channel 4. The 24-hour 
program featured superstar 
entertainment and raised $21 million 
nationally, and $355,479 locally, for 
research and community support.
Theta Xi fraternity encourages people 
to donate canned foods at announced 
parties througout the semester. They 
will give the food to a Pittsburgh food 
bank. Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity 
sponsors an aluminum can recycling 
project for Multiple Sclerosis 
throughout the semester.

In the Fall of 1985, then Campus Affairs 
RaeerFFtt Chairman, Peter Cohen began an 
rSftoFrpuFraS of traffic patterns on city 
streets that cut through campus. The 
rSftoFrpuFraS was prompted by numerous 
students complaining to Student Senate that 
the streets in the campus area are dangerous. 
Cohen said several students had approached 
him who knew people who had been hit. 
The Campus Affairs Committee report found 
that the students' complaints were valid. 
From January, 1985 to January, 1986, there 
were five incidents of pedestrian-automobile 
accidents reported to Campus Police. Since 
that time, the Sixth Station House log 
shows that a like number of accidents have 
occured on the City streets that go through 
the campus.
The committee observed the intersection of 
Forbes and Morewood Avenues on several 
occasions. They found that the traffic light 
there gives pedestrians only six seconds to 
cross Forbes, while giving cars on Forbes 
60 seconds. This is despite the fact that the 
pedestrian traffic crossing Forbes is almost 
equal to, and sometimes heavier than, the 
automobile traffic on Forbes. After 11 pm, 
a button must be pushed to get a pedestrian 
walk light. Using a radar gun obtained for

average speeds of cars on Forbes ranging 
from 36 to 43 miles per hour. This is 
attributed to the near lack of signs reminding 
drivers of the 25 miles per hour speed limit.
High-Speed Rail
PITTSBURGH—The establishment of an 
international center at Carnegie Mellon 
University for the study of high speed 
ground transportation was announced 
Thursday at the board meeting of the 
Pennsylvania High Speed Rail Commission, 
held at Carnegie Mellon.
The High Speed Ground Transportation 
Center (HSGTC) has received its first grant 
for $94,000 from the Commonwealth of 
Pennsylvania and will be operated by Mellon 
Institute's Industry Systems Center at 
Carnegie Mellon, headed by Richard A. 
Uher. The center will have a $750,000 
annual budget by next year, according to 
Uher.

Center will play an important role in the 
development of new industry and technology

Once again, Students Against Apartheid 
(SAA) will demonstrate at CMU's Board of 
Trustees meeting. The meeting, to be held 
February 9 at an as-of-yet undisclosed 
location, is of special importance to SAA; at 
last semester's meeting, a proposal
suggesting inquiry into companies CMU has 
interests in and divestment from those which 
don't adhere to the Sullivan Principles was 
deferred from the Finance Committee to the 
Executive Committee. At SAA's first 
meeting of the semester last Tuesday, leader 
Greg Starsinic was not overly optomistic 
about the issue, expecting it to be passed 
around again before a decision is reached. 
Nontheless, SAA will demonstrate to show 
the Board their interest and commitment to 
divestment 
Also discussed at the meeting were plans 
for a fourth rally. Starsinic said they would 
probably have one," although plans are 
tentative. He cited last semester's inclement 
weather as partially responsible for the low 
turnout. SAA members believe a rally in 
April, with warmer weather, would attract a
of high speed rail, both steel-wheeled 
systems and magnetic levitation, or maglev, 
systems," said Richard M. Cyert, president 
of Carnegie Mellon.
The initial goal is to develop a database of 
information on rail systems and high speed 
magnetic levitation, Uher said.
The center will work with the Pennsylvania 
High Speed Rail Commission, a state 
agency that is studying the feasibility of a 
180-250 m.p.h., two-hour passenger service 
from Pittsburgh to Philadelphia, and the 
High Speed Rail Association, a 
multidisciplinary trade group, Uher says. 
The center will work with these groups, 
with manufacturers and with others "to build 
the world's most reliable and complete 
source of information on high speed rail of 
all types."
larger crowd, as did last year's April 4th 
rally.
After the old one was dismantled in 
November, SAA discussed constructing 
another shanty in the spring. On the topic, 
member Rollie Wesen claimed "it's not that 
we don't want to build one, it's that we don’t 
have the time." Still, the possibilty of 
another shanty exists: said Starsinic, "I don't 
think it [the shanty] actually moved 
divestment along, but it definitely raised 
awareness on campus. In the long run that 
could help."
Other topics brought up at the meeting 
included activités to raise awareness on 
campus and having a separate ceremony on 
commencement day, where an honorary 
degree would be given to imprisoned anti- 
Apartheid activist Nelson Mandela. Mandela 
was nominated for an honorary degree last 
year, but lost because, according to one 
Administration official, he couldn't accept 
his degree in person. Mandela lost to 
Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board Paul 
Voelker and Admiral Grace Hopper, 
developer of the language COBOL, among 
others.
"We intend to provide a reference library of 
technical, financial and progress reports on 
high speed ground transportation projects," 
he said. "We will maintain a database of 
construction and operating costs, 
technologies, project time frames and short- 
and long-term job creation data."
"The existence of the center in Pennsylvania 
will establish the state as the sole most 
knowledgeable and reliable source of 
information on key issues in this rapidly 
developing mode of ground transportation."
High speed rail systems and magnetic 
levitation systems are the two most advanced 
technologies entering the transportation 
field, according to Uher. A high speed 
transportation system would allow 
passengers to travel across Pennsylvania in 
approximately two hours, compared with 
seven hours by rail today. Pennsylvania is 
one of the dozen states studying high speed 
technology. Others include Ohio, Florida, 
Texas, New York, Michigan, Illinois, 
California Nevada.
Japan's bullet train, using high speed 
technology, operates at 130 m.p.h. and will 
soon increase to 155 m.p.h. The system has 
carried more than two billion passengers 
without a single fatality or serious accident 
for 22 years. The French TGV operates daily 
at 168 m.p.h. between Paris and Lyons, 
carrying 300,000 passengers per week. 
Other high speed trains are operating in 
Great Britain, West Germany, Spain and 
Italy.
Magnetic levitation trains, propelled by a 
powerful wave of magnetic energy along a 
specially fitted guideway, have been tested in 
various parts of the world. A West German 
consortium has built a 20-mile test track on 
which it has operated a maglev vehicle at 
222 m.p.h. The Japanese National Railroad 
has developed a maglev vehicle that has been 
tested at more than 300 m.p.h.
Cyert thanked State Representative Richard 
J. Cessar (R-North Hills), principal sponsor 
of the legislation, and recognized the 
contributions of State Representatives 
Richard A. Geist (R-Altoona), chair of the 
HSIRPC, Thomas J. Murphy (D-North
Side).
SAMS Holds First Event
By ERIC W. LEULIETTE
Tartan Staffwriter
At a special meeting on Wednesday, 
Students Against Multiple Sclerosis 
(SAMS) announced the first event of its
1987 fundraiser. The committee is planning 
for activities on January 27 at the Tartan 
Grill to gain interest in this year's effort. 
The event includes three hours of airband 
videotapes, some as old as 1984. The 
evening will also be the first opportunity to 
buy balloons and sweatshirts. The $1 
balloons will be released on February 3 as 
the kick-off of the fundraising campaign. 
The $17 sweatshirts will eventually be sold 
at Scotland Yard and perhaps at tables around 
campus, but the first chance to purchase one 
will be the 27th.
Though IFC elections kept the meeting 
small, Chairman Marcus Muster was able to 
plan future events. The committee discussed 
the particulars of the Rock Alike airband. 
scheduled for early March. Members 
mentioned difficulties in contacting radio 
stations for publicity. Also, some suggested 
SUP A and GSIA be included more in the 
activités.

New Buggy Safety Requirements Challenged by Entrants
continued from page 1
foggy. They're multiplying die risk by 
three," was one concern.
"The new rules will hurt some 
organizations. The problem is not with the 
high tech buggies," said Stufft. "The 
standard ones are very marginal. You'd be 
surprised to see the inside of some buggies .;
Many Buggy Chairmen question whether 
every Sweepstakes Committee will have the 
expertise to consistently evaluate the new 
requirements.
"Unless someone [who inspects the 
buggies] really knows mechanical 
engineering, there will be some problems 
estimating the load on the protective cage 
without actually loading it" Swamp said.
"We can't put the load on the buggy," said 
Stufft. "We wrote it that way to give the 
Buggy Chairmen some idea of what we 
expect"
Many Buggy Chairmen are upset that the 
Sweepstakes Committee announced the rules 
eight weeks before the first buggy practice. 
Organizations usually depend upon starting 
buggy improvements during the fall 
semester to meet their Sweepstakes goals.
"Well be pressing it to be ready in eight 
weeks," said Matt Wagner, who co-chairs 
Spirit's buggy program with Robert Bowie. 
Spirit competed for the first time in 1986. 
"We couldn't start early because we didn't 
want to underbuild or overbuild. The 
Alumni Committee is insulated from some 
of our problems."
"There's zero phase-in time for most of the 
rules. We might have to race three buggies 
instead of four, said Browning. ‘There needs 
to be enough time to implement all the 
changes. Then [every organization] has to 
make sure all the nuts and bolts are tight. 
That could be the biggest safety hazard this 
year."
The new requirements are expensive. 
Organizations allocated their Sweepstakes 
budgets in the fall, months before the 
Sweepstakes Committee announced rule 
changes. Most groups believe they will be 
hard-pressed to find money for their most 
exciting plans after they modify their 
buggies to qualify.
"We had a tight budget. Now we must 
spend several hundred dollars more than we 
intended. We'll make it somehow," said 
Wagner.
"Our biggest problem is just getting
started," said Scott Spriggs, Assistant Buggy 
Chairman at Kappa Delta Rho fraternity. 
"Some other fraternities have a similar 
problem now." Kappa Delta Rho received 
full Inter-Fraternity Council recognition on 
January 21, and will participate in 
Sweepstakes for the first time this year.
Buggies such as "The Limo" from Sigma 
Alpha Epsilon fraternity and "Miss 
Budweiser" from Pi Lambda Phi fraternity, 
which are remembered for their outrageous 
appearance, drivers with flair and their ability 
not to succumb to big budgets and intense 
practices, may not appear again in the style 
that Sweepstakes crowds remember. "If we 
make exceptions to the new rules we'll have 
judgement calls. Then all buggies won't be 
safe," Stufft said.
The new Sweepstakes rules press 
competitors to reconsider their strategies -
- and, in some cases, abstain from hard- 
earned technological advances. Changes in 
the Sweepstakes’ Design Competition "will 
make it like a car show," said Stufft.
"Sweepstakes is like the Indy 500," said 
Swamp. "Every year they make more
regulations. But it just keeps getting
faster."
Look for more buggy news in next week's 
Tartan.
New Rules: Here are highlights of the 
new driver safety and buggy construction 
rules. The precise rules are compiled in an 
83-page document.
Braking Capability Test In addition 
to measuring brake response when the buggy 
moves forward, the test administrator will 
pull the buggy backward while the driver 
brakes. A spring mechanism will evaluate 
the procedure. The purpose of this test is to 
prevent safety problems during tail-spins or 
if an unattended buggy rolls down a hill.
Leather Gloves. Required for drivers in 
buggies with internal moving parts or a 
removable shell between the driver's hands 
and the road. Leather gloves resist rips.
Head Protection. All drivers must wear 
hockey-style helmets endorsed by the 
Sweepstakes Committee. This policy is
Software Discounts Offered to Students and Educators from Diskovery Systems
Diskovery Educational Systems Corp. 
of Palm Beach, Florida, a company 
dedicated to supplying computer products 
to the educational community, has 
recently announced dealer agreements with 
Microsoft Corp., Macware, Innovative 
Software and Microcomputer Accessories 
to market their products at unique low 
educational prices not found through other 
distributors.
Any school, or member of the 
educational community using Apple, 
IBM, or compatible personal computers 
can save 40% to 83% off the list price on 
leading computer products through 
Diskovery's Educational Purchasing 
Program (EPP).
"The EPP was designed so that 
microcomputer users in the educational 
community can have access to the most
productive full-featured versions of 
software at very affordable prices. For 
example Microsoft's QuickBasic 
Compiler is listed at $99.00 but may be 
purchased for $53.00 through Diskovery. 
Or Macware's Filemaker Plus program for 
the Macintosh listed at $295.00 may be 
purchased for only $156.00," says Dan 
Wechsler, Diskovery's Marketing 
Manager. "These savings may be found 
throughout Microsoft, Macware and 
Innovative's product lines in our catalog."

waived until January 1, 1988 if a driver 
wearing the helmet can't fit in an otherwise 
approved buggy. The Sweepstakes 
Committee must approve any other method.
Safety Harness. The Sweepstakes 
Committee designed a prototype that they 
believe will better protect drivers from a head- 
on collision than the harnesses that each 
organization designed. Organizations must 
buy one approved harness each year until 
they have one for each buggy they race. The 
Sweepstakes Committee thinks that the 
harness will soon cost less than the current 
version, priced at $200.
Protective Cage. An additional 
structure, braced every foot, that encloses the 
driver and can withstand at least 500 pounds 
of pressure on the top and sides.
Pushbar. A bar that protrudes from the 
rear of the buggy that "pushers” grasp to 
propel the buggy up hills. Pushbars are no 
longer permitted to drop backwards so that 
they rest beyond the buggy perimeter.
Exterior Windscreen. Protects driver 
from wind, dust flying objects and debris. 
After January 1, 1988, it must be
constructed from LEX AN, a clear 
polycarbonate plastic, and bolted to the 
protective cage. Clear LEXAN must be used 
for night practices.
Interior Windscreen. Constructed and 
fastened like the exterior windscreen, it 
separates an interior wheel and the driver. 
Required for buggies with an interior wheel. 
Drivers must also wear goggles.
Driver Education Program. Anyone 
interested in driving a buggy -- but no 
Buggy Chairmen unless they're also drivers -
- must attend all sessions. Directed by the 
Sweepstakes Committee, the meetings will 
review practice and race procedures, course 
terrain and strategies for normal and 
emergency situations. Drivers will receive a 
written summary of the material covered 
during each meeting.
Trucks. Some organizations prepare their 
buggies inside a truck or tent before racing. 
Curtains must be used instead of doors. 
And, no flammable chemicals or open 
flames are allowed inside these structures.

permanent and as of yet Housing is still to 
make the necessary lasting repairs. Coudriet 
admits however," that Housing does do some 
good work after you demand it." He adds, 
"The solution is simple. Housing just has to 
follow up on their repairs."
Greek advisor Ron Campagna sees the 
problem as "having fault on both sides". He 
says he is aware of a definite problem and 
feels that in the present situation that 
Housing does what it can." Campagna sees 
the current on-campus fraternity system as 
advantageous because the administration can 
keep "a more watchful eye" on the 
fraternities, including protection from 
Pittsburgh Police and their complaints about 
fraternity parties. Campagna is unsure of the 
policy of renting the houses to the 
fraternities, claiming the brothers are left 
without pride of ownership. He claims, "If 
the houses were their own property and they 
had to be responsible for them, maybe we 
would see a better appearance." In addition, 
Campagna advocates "better communication 
from both sides" as the short term solution 
to this pressing problem.
their mostly American arsenal, Iranian 
troops were forced to resort to "human wave" 
tactics, largely ineffectual against the World 
War I style trenches the Iraqis have dug 
themselves into (Iraq has also flooded major 
porions of the front to hinder the Iranians 
from advancing on ground.) Since then, the 
war has largely been in status quo with the 
Iranians gaining minimally over Iraqi troops.
President Saddam Hussein's greatest 
miscalculation was to underestimate the 
Iranians' religous and patriotic fervour. 
Lacking mine-clearing equipment, young 
Revolutionary Guards at the front linked 
hands and ran through mine-fields in waves, 
clearing a path for the troops behind them. 
Death through martyrdom is considered a 
direct path to heaven, a fact cleverly 
exploited by the clergy. At one point 
volunteers were given gold-plated keys 
purported to open the gates of heaven if they 
fell at the front. Many fear mutilation 
instead of death, as it would mean a life of 
misery instead of the glory of a martyr. 
Hence, the government takes good care of 
those wounded at the war, moving them into 
palace-like houses abandoned or confiscated 
from the rich. At the comer of every street in
the cities of Iran, one can find little altars 
containing the picture of a young man, a few 
of his personal posessions, and pieces of 
paper carrying religous writing from the 
Koran. The pictures are all of men who have 
died at the front. It is considered shameful if 
a street lacks one of these little altars, 
signifying that no family from that street 
has contributed a martyr to the cause of the 
war. People then darkly talk of "taghuti " or 
decadent rich families who have most likely 
sent their sons to a foreign country to escape 
the war.
The war was also welcomed in a perverse 
way by the Iranian government. It gave them 
an excuse to crack down on dissidents as 
Iraqi agents and diverted the energies of the 
younger more restless elements in the 
country. Khomeini has a personal stake in 
the war: He would like to take revenge for 
the way he was treated by Saddam Hussein 
when he sought asylum in Iraq during the 
Shah's times. His stated goal is the fall of 
the Iraqi President by whatever means 
possible.
It is as yet unclear who will be the 
ultimate victor in this grueling struggle. In a 
war of attrition, the country with the
By ALEX HOOSHMUND
Tartan Staffwriter 
One of the side effects of the recent Iranian 
arms scandal has been to bring the Gulf war 
between Iran and Iraq, dubbed "The Forgotten 
War" by some, into public attention again. 
The Iranians have just started a series of new 
offensives with the ultimate goal of 
capturing the city of Basra. Strategists on 
both sides consider Basra the key to the war. 
A port city, Basra is Baghdad's (the Iraqi 
capital) only connection to the waterways of 
the Gulf. In case 
Basra falls, Iran 
will be able to cut
off vital supplies from Baghdad. The Iraqi 
morale is likely to collapse and, more 
importantly, the Khomeini regime will 
have the opportunity to set up a puppet 
Shiite government in Basra, a rallying point 
for Iraq’s 55% majority of Shiite moslems. 
Although still meeting heavy resistance by 
the Iraqis, Iranian troops now have Basra 
practically under a state of siege. Iranian 
positions 50 km away are well within range 
to shell the city of one million. The city 
population, largely unaffected by the war 
except for a dearth of young men, is fleeing 
in droves.
The bloody six-year history of this war is 
without parallel in modem times. In 
December 1980, the Iraqi President, Saddam 
Hussein, hoping to take advantage of the 
state of confusion in Iran in the aftermath of 
the revolution, launched an invasion on 
Iranian soil to gain complete control of the 
of the Shat-el Arab waterways to the Persian 
Gulf. Far from paralyzing the nation, the 
invasion galvanized the Iranians into unity 
and action. With its greater manpower and 
comparable firepower at the initial stages of 
the war, Iran repulsed the invasion and 
carried the war back into Iraqi territory. 
However, unable to acquire replacements for
stronger economy usually prevails, but in 
this case, both economies lie in shambles. 
Most strategists favour Iran by a small 
margin, especially after small but important 
gains on the ground recently. They believe 
that the 3 to 1 superiority of Iran in terms of 
manpower will ultimately make the 
difference. Arab countries in the region, 
fearing infection by Iran's particular strain of 
Islamic fundamentalism, are eyeing the 
situation nervously. Direct military 
intervention, especially by Egypt, in case of 
Iraqi collapse at Basra is not out of the 
question. It is absolutely vital that the U.S. 
administration follow a coherent policy in 
face of such a potentially explosive 
situation. At the moment, the answer to the 
question where the U.S. stands and who the 
U.S. is helping seems to depend on who you 
ask: the CIA, the White House, or the State 
Department. The U.S. has clearly helped 
both sides at one time or the other, thus 
prolonging the war and the danger of all out 
war in the Gulf region. Although such a war 
seems to be remote to the average American, 
it must be understood that this poses the 
most likely scenario for a direct U.S.-Soviet 
confrontation in the near future.

Housing Needs to 
Change its Tune
Part of the problem with Carnegie Mellon's 
Housing Office is that it plays to an essentially
captive audience. No matter how poor the 
conducting, or how sour the notes, for freshmen, 
frats and convenience-seekers, Tony Martin's 
department is the only show in town.
When the competition isn't on, it's easy to let things 
slide a little. But broken sinks, lack of hot water and 
defective fire extinguishers (like the ones in Skobell) 
hardly reflect the quality of performance one expects 
given the price of the ticket. Boo-hiss.
Martin's professed innocence of these and other 
problems in university housing facilities falls on 
disbelieving and increasingly disgruntled ears. 
Students say the deficiencies have been reported, 
often numerous times, but all to no avail.
Student demands do not seem outrageous. Greeks 
and other residents are requesting only that their 
environment be minimally livable and safe. Such 
requests must be met with competent and expedient 
service. University Housing should make all the 
more effort to satisfy students because we're stuck.
If the performance stinks, we can't just get up and 
leave at intermission.
Everyone Loves a 
Good Weird Death
Let's be honest. R. Budd Dwyer, the former and 
late State Treasurer, was a criminal; he was
obviously suicidal, and one would think, given.the
state-wide wake, that he was a hero. <
In fact, no one is mourning for Dwyer. Everyone,
including the state, is merely applauding the bizarre
nature of his death, marveling at the chutzpah that it
takes to shoot oneself on camera.
In December, Dwyer, 47, was convicted of bribery.
As Treasurer, he awarded a $4.6 million contract to a
small computer company without allowing
competition. He faced a prison sentence of up to 55
years. At the press conference last Thursday, 
everyone expected Dwyer's resignation. Instead, 
reporters and cameramen got to watch as he put a 
.357 magnum in his mouth and pulled the trigger. 
Is a man in an official position, who swindles the 
state and shoots himself at a news conference really a 
hero? The question is a rhetorical one. Budd Dwyer
is simply newsworthy. His grandiose, televised
funeral procession and state flags flying at half-mast
are not in keeping with the nature of the Dwyer's
death. 
There are those who mourn legitimately: those who 
knew Dwyer and are naturally affected by his strange 
demise. Media hype is to be expected and endured. 
But why is the state contributing to the spectacle? In 
recognition of the fact that Dwyer was a convicted 
criminal and in order to prevent Pennsylvania's own 
embarassment at having a crooked Treasurer, and out 
of pity for the family of an unbalanced man, the state 
should not be drawing more attention to the event 
with the large funeral in Meadeville and low-flying 
flags. That's not respect for the dead. It's just 
reveling in the same cheap thrills as the rest of the 
viewing audience.

Whether or not one agrees with the 
"no funding of political groups" 
clause in the Senate Constitution, 
senators are required to adhere to it, 
and indeed to the entire document.
The Funding and Recognition 
Committee plays a vital role to the 
Senate and their recommendations 
are heeded virtually always by the 
entire body. Ultimately, however, 
it is the decision of the body as a 
whole, and not just the committee 
as to the funding status of 
organizations. The authors are 
correct in stating that in this 
instance the Senate did not adhere 
completely to the committee's 
advice.
Whether the Senate initially erred 
in granting the club funding is 
certainly a point of contenetion. 
Since I have consistently voted 
against funding the Objectivist 
Club (and later voted to remove 
that funding) I would concur with 
the belief that the Senate did err in 
initially funding the organization. 
This view is not held unanimously 
by all Senators, however.
The authors asserted that they 
were not given the opportunity to 
defend their claims that the club 
was not political. That statement 
could not be further from the truth. 
The Objectivists, to my 
knowledge, were given more 
opportunities than any other 
group to defend their status. 
Ultimately, however, the Senate's 
opinion differed from that of the 
club. Since the Objectivist 
philosophy is founded under 
specific political pretenses 
(specifically they hold that the 
government should be virtually 
nonexistant) one wonders how the 
organization can claim to be 
anything but political.
The Funding and Recognition 
Committee had previously denied 
funding to the Democratic 
Socialists of America -- an 
ideological opposite of the 
Objectivists. Clearly then, to 
continue funding the Objectivists 
would be quite hypocritical on the 
part of the Senate.
The notion that the Senate pulled 
a fast one is again not based on 
fact. Senators that were working 
to revoke the' chib’s funding status 
(myself included) were sure to 
inform the club of our intentions 
and specifically when these 
intentions would be carried out. 
When Club President Reinagel left 
the first meeting, Senator Greg 
Starsenic (CIT) ran out of the 
meeting to reinform her of our 
intentions to revoke their funding. 
Given the aforementioned incident, 
it was clearly the club's fault that 
they were not defended, especially 
since no club members were
Objectivists Criticized
Editor:
The Jan. 20, 1987 letter to the 
Tartan from Pam Reinagel and the 
Objectivist Club was a farewell to 
funding from the Student Senate. 
Pam and the club didn't want to 
waste their breath trying to explain 
a complex issue to the befuddled 
Senate. When the Senate took 
away their future funding due to 
alleged "activism", and due to the 
"political" nature of the club, Pam 
and the club declared that they were 
going to do without the money, 
just to show them that real 
individualists don't waste their 
time with lesser minds.
The tone of that letter was that of 
breast-beaten indignation, very 
appropriate to a group of people 
mesmerized by the hysteria of Ayn 
Rand's philosophy. It was also 
untrue on at least one account.
Perhaps a group of individualists 
who fail to see the absurdity of 
being in a "club" professing, of all 
things, "objectivism" shouldn't be
willing to stay at the meeting to 
do so. The notion that we should 
have waited for a meeting that 
convenienced the club's members 
while accounts are continually 
drawn upon is absurd.
I do concur with the authors that 
a clearer definition of the word 
political and indeed an assessment 
as to whether or not political 
groups should or should not be 
funded is in order. The newly 
formed Senate Rules Committee 
(which I chair) is currently 
undertaking such a project. I find 
it ironic, however, that the authors 
would heroically conclude that they 
are now rejecting Senate funding.
For it appears that the Senate has > j 
already withdrawn that privalege 
from the organization.

blamed for collective nonsense and 
short memory. In fact, at least one 
of them has been involved in 
precisely the sort of activism 
which makes their club a political 
ruse. Brian Crago enjoyed a chance 
on March 26, 1986, to lambast a 
philanthropist in the Pitt News 
last year. Objectivist clubs are 
often over-confident pillagers of 
ego-centrist monomania, and Ms. 
Reinagel evidently realized that few 
people were likely to understand 
either their disdain for government 
money, nor their quarrel with 
philanthropy.
In essence, however, the 
Objectivists missed a chance to 
prove themselves, opting instead 
to blame Senate. Pam is quite 
right to get the club away from 
government funding, if she is at all 
sincere about pursuing object­
ivism. In my opinion the pursuit 
of objectivism is like the pursuit 
for the Holy Grail. They measure

Ronaldo Contends with God for Future Leadership
By PAUL SMITH
Kt,k(tduFrSp from okdptdLT FEt t'usFtC 
wk,t Ronaldo has just received final 
dt,aeetSCuFraSo u7akF who oEaksC succeed 
Ere Odae FEt1 Wonderful House of O'Regano 
Election Symposium (a 
name suggested by Nancy). 
Some of the most 
prominent people in the 
nation were named to the 
Symposium just before 
Column Christmas and they met 
tftdL day for a month in an underground 
(ud2rSp lot somewhere in Idaho. (The 
’tStdus Accounting Office is said to be 
usdtuCL conducting an investigation into the 
kot of contra-aid for parking fees and USAF 
.tFo for transport: however, no report is 
t'(t,FtC until after the 1988 elections.)
Grand Wizard of the Symposium, Justice 
Scalia (known affectionately as "The Italian 
Scallion"), laid out the criteria for choosing 
the next head of the House of O’Reagano. 
First, it had to be a white male. Second, he 
should know nothing. Third, he should be 
unable to remember when he first found out 
what he doesn't know. Fourth, he should be 
able to spell the word "bicentennial."
The criteria were clearly quite stringent. 
Indeed, vice-chair of the symposium, 
Michael Deaver (representing himself)
complained that too many upstanding 
gentlemen would be excluded; and he named 
for example a few cabinet members of his 
acquaintance in this country and others. His 
objections got lost, however, in a more 
important debate. Michael Jackson, junior 
and token member of the group, pointed out 
that the fourth criterion would effectively 
prevent II Duce himself being considered a 
candidate. After long debate (costing the 
contras $3.75 an hour per member of the 
symposium), and after an ex officio 
suggestion from Nancy, the fourth 
stipulation was dropped.
That move certainly widened the field. But 
Pat Robertson remarked that, just the same, 
the strongest candidate was still God. In a 
recent communication God had told him 
that, even if the word "bicentennial" wasn't 
in Genesis, He wanted to remind everyone 
that He Alone had manufactured the 
American Constitution and should certainly 
be a shoe-in for the job.
Ed Meese disputed God’s claim on the 
grounds that II Duce himself was the only 
person who really knew what the 
Constitution meant and therefore was the 
person who had written it. At this point 
Maureen O'Reagano, freshly banished to 
Idaho and so not involved in the contra- 
aid/USAF scam, asked a question about the
Letters Cont.Candidate Cites Housing Mess
Editor:
At last Wednesday's Inter-Fraternity 
Council meeting, Ron Campana, the Greek 
advisor, informed us that someone had 
complained about the party signs fraternities 
put up on campus. I'll admit they've become 
a menace to my eyes— especially this year. 
However, these posters are there out of 
necessity.
Fraternities are like businesses. They pay 
rent; they invest in and execute projects; 
they repair broken equipment
There are no waiting lists for fraternity 
housing. In fact, fraternities are pressed to
Contract Negotiations - Private Affair
Editor:
I am writing in response to the article and 
editorial in the January 20 issue of the 
Tartan concerning the union negotiations at 
RhA1 By tradition and design, labor 
negotiations are a private affair between the 
parties until they are settled. It is by mutual 
agreement that the details are not discussed 
outside of the negotiations until they are 
settled. It is also generally true that the 
result is a package of compromises on both 
orCto which cannot be evaluated fairly in a 
piecemeal fashion.
Both the Local 29 and administration 
representatives have kept their commitments 
Fa not discuss publicly the details of the 
negotiations. Your readers can be assured 
FEuF both sides are working diligently and in 
paaC faith to settle the issues which separate 
FEte while fulfilling their obligations to the 
saSp run welfare of their respective 
constituencies. If we prove unable to do so, 
FEtS the issues may become more public, 
but in that case the historical record is not 
replete with examples where the process 
improves. It is unfortunate the "ugly 
rumors" are circulating, but I don't know 
what more can be done to prevent that. I 
believe that the parties at interest are fully 
informed.

find new tenants/members in order to come 
up with sufficient funds for rent (fraternity 
buildings are university owned and 
fraternities pay rent to Housing).
Housing doesn't see the rent the fraternities 
pay as sufficient to cover costs of 
maintenance and are reluctant to upkeep the 
fraternity buildings. With deteriorating 
conditions, fraternity housing becomes less 
desirable.
The fraternities would rather move off 
campus and pay $46,000 a year (the cost of 
rent) towards mortgages on Fifth Avenue 
estates. Yet, the administration doesn't want 
the fraternities moving off campus (and 
possibly wreaking havoc in a residential 
section where campus security can’t smooth 
things over).
To make fraternity housing more 
appealing, fratemites have large parties. In 
order to attract students to these parties, they 
need to put up signs.
Fraternity houses at other universities are 
usually big old mansions. I'll never 
understand why CMU decided to build dorm- 
like structures to house fraternities.
I can't see the housing situation getting 
any worse. So whoever complained about 
the party signs- sorry.

success on an initial distortion.
The issue of whether Student Government 
should fund political groups is quite different 
than whether Objectivists should accept such 
funding, which they shouldn't. I think 
Student Government should fund political 
groups, because controversy is healthy and 
nothing to shy away from.
The tone of the Objectivist Club's letter 
was silly. They dropped an empty 
announcement as if it were a bombshell.

Founding Father. The symposium's 
secretary, Jeanne Kirkpatrick, rebuked her 
sharply for her stupidity and pushed through 
a recommendation that no women be allowed 
to serve on the symposium. Poor old Mo 
was thus banished to become a top executive 
with IBM and the Defense Department.
So far the race seemed to be between God 
and II Duce himself. But a couple of people 
pointed out that neither of them would be a 
very practicable choice since, by definition, 
an heir ought to be a little younger than 
those two. It was then that the question of 
Margaret Thatcher came up. Nobody had any 
qualms about her patriotism—that had been 
firmly established many times over. But 
there was some doubt about whether 
Americans would understand her fake British 
accent. This led to a debate over whether or 
not she might be just a little too good at 
spelling. After all, Americans get very upset 
at having someone educated and intelligent 
in prominent public positions.
The deliberations were really not getting 
very far. There was a general sense that 
nobody was really right to succeed II Duce. 
When you looked back over the last six 
years and saw everything that Ronaldo had 
done not only for the House of O'Reagano 
but also for America....
Single-handedly, II Duce had made America 
great again, either by ignoring or by 
threatening, insulting and even bombing 
anyone who thought America was already 
great enough. And he'd made the presidency 
great again by the simple strategy of never 
saying anything coherent (except at the 
funerals of those who'd died helping him 
make America great again). And he'd made 
the economy great again by giving free rein 
to everyone who wanted to get money the 
old-fashioned way (stealing it from those 
who didn’t).
The only possible doubt you could have 
about him was that he’d neither drained the 
country's marshes, nor got the trains to run 
on time. And even there he'd had bright 
ideas: sell the marshes to toxic waste 
disposal companies, and sell the railroads to 
private contractors to whom Cap Weinberger 
would then entrust the task of hiding 
America's newly great nuclear arsenal. No, 
there was really no contest-11 Duce would 
show how great he was by becoming his 
own heir.

least abstained. At that point there was a 
sudden rush of self-nominations. Everyone 
except Michael Jackson opined that they 
could easily do just as good a job as Ronaldo 
had done, so why shouldn't they be 
considered.
The Italian Scallion suggested that, with 
some help from his friend Rhenquist, Chief 
Inquisitor, he could contribute by 
reinstituting slavery-only this time it 
wouldn't just be blacks. Deaver said he could 
make all the group members billionaires if 
only they'd trust him. Kirkpatrick promised 
that with her contacts she could meld 
America, Israel and South Africa into a new 
Union for Global Domination. Robertson 
said he'd force God to visit plagues upon all 
communists and associated state terrorist 
regimes.
Meese, however, pointed out that they were 
already conducting the first stages of that 
experiment and finding that it was too 
dangerous because AIDS couldn't distinguish 
between movie stars and communists (in the 
fifties even II Duce himself had shown how 
difficult that was). What we really need, Ed 
proposed, is constitution reform. He'd see to 
it that a new, fairer, and simplified version 
was ratified: just a one-liner replacing all 
current protections with the right to get rich.
Young Michael was getting a bit impatient 
at this point, wondering what he could 
contribute. He finally suggested that they 
refer their suggestions to Ronaldo himself.
II Duce's reaction to the proposals was 
announced just yesterday. Commending the 
symposium on its sterling work under harsh 
conditions, he said he'd give them all a free 
vacation in Cape Town (donated by IBM and 
the Defense Department in return for 
promotional considerations).
And he thought, he and Nancy thought, 
that there suggestion by whatsisname, if he 
read it right, that one was a true tribute to 
the greatness of America. The new second- 
string quarterback's gotta be that guy that 
threw that great touchdown pass. Y’know,

whatsisname...y’know, that hunk that blew 
away Carmel with that Magnum .347, the 
most powerful hand-gun in the world that’d 
blow your head clean off. Yup. And God 
bless you all.

Winter. Snow flakes falling down ever so 
delicately on the pristine white ground. 
Silver crystals carried by a frail breeze 
passing through the evergreen trees blanketed 
with snow. Quick, what would you be doing 
if you were situated here: skiing? Did you 
think skiing? Well, that's fine for all you 
expert skiers out there, but what about the 
rest of you? You dunno? Well, lemme 
remind you about another winter pastime 
which can conjure up just as many winter 
images.
How about outdoor ICE SKATING? Yes, 
in Pittsburgh! So it won't be Rockefeller 
Center, but it's not going to be as 
expensive, either. Ice skating isn't as 
rigorous as skiing (one frequently sees a 
senior citizen or two who manage to figure 
skate quite well in these rinks, and if they 
can do it, so can you), and it takes less skill 
(just a sense of balance), so it’s easier to 
learn. Frequently, learning is half the fun! 
(Watching other novices learning how to 
skate but wiping out instead is fun, too!) Ice 
skating is also CHEAP — unlike some other 
things I won't dare mention here. On top of 
all of these points, an outdoor skating rink 
is within walking distance from campus!
So now that I've thoroughly 
convinced you to put ice skating on your 
agenda for this weekend, lemme supply you 
with the details:
The Place:
Schenley Park, Overlook Drive, 422-6547 
The Hours:
Everyday except Mon 7:00-9:30 PM 
Everyday except Mon & Tue 4:00-6:30 PM 
Wed (*), Sat, Sun 1:00-3:30 PM 
Fri (*), Sat (*) 10:00PM-12:30AM
* Adults only
The Rates:
Mon-Fri daylight sessions for:
Adults (19 & up), $1.00.
For Non-Residents,$1.25.
Teens, $ .75
Evening& Weekend daylight sessions: 
Adults (19 & up), $1.50.
For Non-Residents,$1.75.
Teen, $ 1.00 
Skate rentals: $ .75
How to get there:
Start at the Green Beach with the 
Conservatory in front of you. Make a left to 
follow the road (running across between you 
and the Conservatory). Go over the Panther 
Hollow Bridge until you reach the end of it, 
where the Nature Center is located (the house 
with the big red bird). There will be a
illustration by Kurt .Shaw
division of three roads: take the middle one. 
Follow the road, going under the tunnel. 
When coming out of the tunnel, stay on the 
right side of the road - it will bend to the 
left, and then up to a hill. The rink is just 
on top of the hill.
A couple of tips:
It might be a good idea to wear two pairs 
of socks on each foot, especially if you have 
sensitive feet. Because one, you might 
develop blisters, and two, your feet might 
get cold. And don't wear bulky clothing. 
Finally, may I suggest that you go during 
the Adult sessions. The other sessions, 
especially on weekends, are swarmed with 
little kids zooming across the rink who love 
to show their mummies or buddies how well 
they skate.

mansion, charming farmhouse and
others; all beautifully crafted and
decorated.

for those old toy trains in the Attic and 
expert advice will be available.
Tickets are just $4.00 and the show is 
open from 11 am until 5 pm. Just take

Tabs To Save A Life
By JEFF MYERS
Special to The Tartan
Many people throughout the US 
suffer from kidney disease. A majority 
of these people come from middle- 
class or lower-class families and can 
not afford the high cost of treatment. 
Philip lives in Parksburgh, PA and is 
one of these people. Philip's family 
has a great deal of trouble trying to 
finance Philip’s treatment because the 
cost of dialysis treatment is quite high.
Fortunately, there is bright spot in 
Philip's future. Philip is receiving 
dialysis treatment in return for 
recyclable pop-tabs and beer-tabs. 
Narrowing it down, Philip receives 
about one minute of treatment for each 
tab he is able to produce.
A Carnegie Mellon student, Matt 
Wagner, is conducting a drive to 
collect tabs to take home to Philip. 
Scotland Yard has agreed to aid in 
Matt's plight by housing a collection 
box for the recyclable tabs. With the 
help of the Carnegie Mellon 
population, I beleive that we could 
make this drive a success. The drive 
has already produced enough tabs to 
give Philip over 16 hours of 
treatment. If the student body of 
Carnegie Mellon could be convinced to 
make contributions to the collection 
box, Philip could attain desperately 
needed treatment without putting an 
extra strain on his family.
The collection box should be 
available soon, and will hopefully 
remain throughout the remainder of the 
semester.
Club Spotlight: The Society of Women
by IRENE KAO
Special to The Tartan
The Society of Women Engineers, SWE, 
has gone through some major changes from 
last year. Due to the new officers, this club 
has focused more on having fun and getting 
to know each of the members better.
This year SWE shows more enthusiasm 
than ever. Presently, Carnegie Mellon's 
chapter consists of around 80 girls and four 
males. Yes, new members (male and/or 
female) are still more than welcome to 
participate in SWE's activities.
The organization has two primary goals; 
one is business oriented. SWE has been 
successful in helping its members get jobs. 
Every year in the fall, upperclass members 
in SWE submit their resumes so a "resume 
book" can be compiled. The organization can 
then sell this collection to companies that 
usually recruit people from Carnegie 
Mellon. Also, SWE along with IEEE, 
cosponsors the TOC, Technical 
Opportunities Conference, in which 
companies send representatives to Carnegie 
Mellon.
In conjunction with fraternities, sororities, 
and professional academic societies, SWE 
also sponsored a lecturer from General 
Motors. This semester, SWE has planned 
two workshops for high school women so 
that they can visit Carnegie Mellon's 
campus and disregard many of the 
engineering/science stereotypes for women. 
SWE is proud of winning the Coming 
Glass Works Award, placing Carnegie 
Mellon's SWE chapter in third place
nationally at the national summer
conference.
A lot of new social activities have been 
planned for this year. One is the Big
Sister/Little Sister program. This is where 
upperclassmen act as guides to the freshman 
girls. The upcoming Winter Ball is another 
activity sponsored by SWE. Darla Messick, 
the social chairperson of SWE. She is so 
enthusiastic about the underclassmen's 
involvement in this organization that she 
said, "More committees will be formed so 
the underclassmen could have a chance to 
learn some leadership responsibilities." SWE 
is also involved in the sleeping bag 
campaign, and at the end of the spring 
semester, an annual banquet is held.
The purpose of this organization, as 
Maureen Stempkowski, the president of 
SWE, would put it is, "SWE is a support 
network [in] which we try to encourage more
high school and underclassmen girls to 
seriously consider engineering and science as 
professions. Until we [females] have more 
equality in the engineering and science fields, 
this club will help provide more 
opportunities."
So... why not check this organization out? 
Not only can this provide great business 
opportunities, it is a great chance to meet 
more new people. If you are interested, 
please contact Maureen Stempkowski at 
extension 5924.
Club Spotlight is a new series of columns 
that will be running in The Tartan Features 
section this semester. We hope that you will 
enjoy hearing about the different clubs and 
might be interested in seeing what they are 
about in person. If you are part of a club and 
would like to be a part of Club Spotlight, 
please call us at The Tartan and ask for Dave 
in Features.

The Society of Automotive Engineers is having our 
first meeting of the semester today, Tuesday, January 
27, at 4:30pm. We will meet in Scaife Hall 322, the 
Mechanical Engineering undergraduate lounge for 
refreshments and discussion of the semester's 
agenda.
The two major business items will be establishing 
direction and goals for our BAJA BUGGY (it's like a 
mini dune buggy) work, so that we can compete in the 
midwest regional late in the semester, and discussing 
our trip to Chrysler Headquarters and one of 
their assembly plants early in the week before 
Spring Break.
Does any of this sound interesting to you? Come to our

Monday is Wellness Day 
In The Wherrett Room
By DENNIS REDMOND
Special to The Tartan 
Heads up, children of the ruling class, the 
program you've all been waiting for has now 
been officially announced by the Powers that 
Be. If the sixties were the peace generation 
and the seventies the me generation, then the 
eighties will turn out to be the "wellness" 
generation.
And what, pray tell, is "wellness"? In 
short, fitness in body, mind, and ideology.
Yes, faster than cultural fascism, more 
powerful than Dan Rather, able to leap 
incredible socio-economic impossibilities in 
a single bound - it's Super Fitness from 
Student Affairs.
But before we explore the metaphysical 
difficulties of Super Fitness, let's analyze the 
concrete possibilities of the current program. 
The first Monday in February brings us to 
"Exercise in the Winter Months", starring 
the good Dr. Johnstone, orthopedic specialist 
and athletic advisor. The following week 
we’re greeted with "Diet and Nutrition", 
courtesy of Nurse Leslie Bonsci and the Falk 
Clinic, who will personally lead participants 
on a search-and-destroy mission through
Entropy's candy aisle.
My personal favorite, however, is Feb. 
16th's "Back Massage for Back Problems". 
Insider tips claim there will be real hands-on 
contact with this one; Masseuse Tom Clark 
will however be on hand with suitable 
quantities of ice water to ensure people 
concentrate on the appropriate parts of the 
anatomy.
Moving right along, the heavyweight 
division opens March 2nd with "Smoking:
Want to Quit?", hosted by Anita Barkin in 
conjunction with the National Lung 
Association, and under the aegis of the 
American Cancer Society (hear,hear). Yes, 
your lungs have rights too. But the real fun 
begins the next week, with "Alcohol and 
drugs: how little is too much?". Here let it 
be noted that Super Fitness applies not only 
to the student body, but to the FACULTY 
as well. So, if your Professor is zonked on 
acid, have him, her, or it check in to this 
one. Fran Campbell, formerly of the 
Veterans Administration, will be heading up 
this one.
Finally, there is Carnegie Mellon's very 
own Dr. Lauri Rabin in "Stress
Management", reportedly to be held in the 
ballroom. Term papers, Patrick Buchanan, frat 
parties and other noxious horrors of modem 
life will be dutifully discussed, and ways of 
relieving all this tension will be explored in 
graphic detail. Though this is the last 
seminar, rumor has it that further topics will 
be covered in an upcoming monthly health 
newsletter.
Now we come to those thorny, metaphysical 
questions of life, death, and historical irony. 
Happily, the series seems to be trying to 
address some real needs in the Carnegie 
Mellon community. College is after all 
merely a prelude to life. Are we here simply 
for the machines and the careers and the jobs? 
If you are, you’ve become a machine yourself 
(not unsurprising in a subculture which 
designates sleep as "crashing"). Isn't it rather 
sad that Carnegie Mellon's amazingly 
advanced computer networks coexist with 
amazingly primitive exercise and social 
facilities? It isn't for nothing that college 
spirit is a rare commodity on this campus.
Where can one go to express it? The Cut? 
No, social events stratify into frat 
parties,dorm storms, and apartment roulette. 
Carnegie Mellon's social life is fractured; 
hopefully, the health seminars are a start 
towards mending this state of affairs, towards 
at least a recognition of the problem.
So bag a lunch and come over to the Wherret 
Room to listen to and participate with various 
speakers who will talk about various health- 
related topics! Healthful Mondays -- All 
lectures: 11:30 -12:15 in the Wherret Room.

-"Once upon a time, there was a

up, only the "thing" was too
long. That’s why it sticks up; 
eventually when the ground shifts 
enough the "thing" will sink

the unladen European swallow.
On top there still remains the 
blood stains from young virgins 
and small, furry animals. The 
practice was finally halted be­
cause too few freshman girls fin­
ished their first year-hence, the 
3:1 guy-to-girl ratio. Well now,

unable to capitalize, as Pitt and Carnegie 
Mellon chose to decide the contest with 
physical ability rather than using hockey 
skills.
Both Pitt and CMU were called for 
penalties,but CM's Jim Larson got the worst 
end of the deal, as he was called for roughing 
and misconduct at 13:34, which gave Pitt a 
one man advantage for the last minute of the 
game. With the puck in the Tartan zone, 
Pitt pulled Rohey for an extra attacker with 
1:20 left in the contest. The strategy began 
to work, but at 14:36, Pitt's Barber was 
called for interference in front of the Tartan 
net. That penalty only gave the Panthers 
one extra man, because the goalie Rohey did 
not return to the ice.
The Tartans held the puck in the comer 
behind the net until the final buzzer to secure 
the win. Carnegie Mellon players were 
ecstatic about the win, because the win 
avenged an earlier tie to the Panthers. 
Carnegie Mellon now is in the driver's seat 
for second place in the conference, and now 
will start thier stretch drive against Gannon 
and the other teams in the Western 
Pennsylvania College Hockey Association.

sSTesp 2nd Place in ConferenceIce Tartans Defeat Pitt
The Women are still struggling this season
Lady Tartans fall to Grove City, Bethany
By PERRY PIERCE
Tartan Staffwriter 
-Et Carnegie Mellon Ice Tartans had one 
aO FEtrd biggest wins this past weekend, as 
they came back from 3 goals down to beat 
the University of Pittsburgh 5-4. For the 
-udFuSoT it was the first win against the 
Panthers in the last four tries. The win now 
eafto the Tartans into second place in the 
Western Pennsylvania College Hockey 
Association, holding a 5-1-2 conference 
dt,adCT and a 5-4-2 mark overall. The Tartans 
were also supposed to play the first place 
’uSSaS Golden Knights this weekend, but 
due to weather problems, the game has been 
rescheduled until later this season.
Carnegie Mellon opened up the game 
otFFrSp a fast and furious pace, but their pace 
paF FEte burned early, as Pitt center Greg 
cGtSo took a pass from his left wing and 
oFkOOtC it past an unsuspecting John Kerber. 
-Et goal came at the 1:30 mark, and the 
-udFuSo found themselves playing catch-up 
tudsL1 Pitt took their 1-0 lead and tried to 
Oad,t the Tartans out of the fast game into a 
osaGT physical game.
Only 51 seconds later, Tartan winger John 
Blackwood was called for tripping, and Pitt 
SaG had a big power play opportunity. The 
Tartan penalty killing unit was again superb, 
as it has been all year, and forced Pitt into a 
penalty of thier own, when Greg Downs was 
called for roughing at 2:56. The Tartans 
were given two more power play 
opportunities in the period, but were unable 
to convert either of them. Panther 
goaltender Jeff Rohey played an exceptional 
period,with help from his defensemen. 
Despite only facing four Tartan shots in the 
period, each one was stopped with quick 
reaction time and excellent clearing passes 
aOO rebounds from the defense.
The second period found the Tartans very 
sluggish and flat, and Pitt took advantage of 
CMU misques to break out to a big three 
goal lead. Carnegie Mellon missed a few 
crossing passes in the Pitt zone, and 
the Panthers turned one missed pass into a 
three on two break, as Jeff Barber took a 
pass from two Pitt defensemen to beat 
Kerber to the stick side. The goal, at the 
4:03 marie, gave the Panthers a big 2-0 lead.
Carnegie Mellon regrouped quickly, as the 
Tartans brought out the money line of Mike 
McGuire, John Blackwood, and tri-captain 
Pat Merchak. The line has played 
exceptional hockey since its formation 
earlier this year, have 13 goals in thier last 4 
games, and are an amazing +12 in the 
plus/minus statistic in that stretch. The line 
didn't take long to get the Tartans back into 
the contest, as Merchak fed McGuire for a 
beautiful backhander that beat Rohey at 
5:08. For McGuire, a grad from Quincy, 
Massachusettes, the goal was his ninth goal 
in the last 6 games, and moved his 
consecutive goal streak to four. For 
Merchak, a second year SUPA grad, the 
assist gave him at least one point in his last 
five games.
The Tartans gained a one man advantage at 
the 5:36, as a Pitt winger was called for a 
charge. The Tartans, one skater up, decided 
to leave only one defenseman back in an 
attempt to rush the net. Carnegie Mellon's 
strategy backfired, as only :25 seconds into 
the power play, Pitt was out on a 2 on 1 
breakaway, as Greg Timmons, the lone 
Tartan defender was unable to stop a crossing 
pass to Pitt's Gary Oldaker. Oldaker's shot 
beat kerber to the glove side, and gave Pitt a 
big 3-1 lead. The shorthanded goal was the 
first one the Tartans surrendered since a loss 
last semester to Penn State West.
Throughout the second period, the Panthers 
held the advantage, slowing the game's pace 
down. Carnegie Mellon was forced into the 
physical style of hockey Pitt is famous for, 
and Carnegie Mellon was getting put into 
the penalty box trying to be overagressive. 
Eleven minutes into the period, the Panthers
struck again, as the Tartans were down a 
skater. This power play goal gave the 
Panthers a big 4-1 lead, and CMU had to 
score before the end of the period in order to 
get the momentum back in thier end.
l'iie Tartan charge was led by Jim Larson, 
who's backchecking was superb. But even 
though Pitt was having trouble keeping the 
puck, so were the Tartans. A big 
opportunity was lost when junior 
defenseman Sean McGinn got tangled with 
teammate Brian Nogrady on a drop pass right 
in front of the Pitt blue line. Other Tartan 
misques in the period included missing on 
three open net opportunités, due to missed 
shots.
With less than 45 seconds left in the 
period, Tartan center McGuire broke from 
the Pitt defense and beat Rohey to the glove 
side to close the Pitt lead to 4-2. For 
McGuire, it was his 5th muliple goal game 
this year. The goal gave the Tartans a big 
momentum advantage going into the third 
period, and only two goals down, a big 
confidence boost that they could come back. 
"McGuire's goal was key," commented 
Tartan defenseman Mark Licata, "it really 
put us back in the game." For his play on 
the day, McGuire received WRCT player of 
the game honors.
The Tartans came out like a house on fire 
in the third period, scoring off the opening 
face off. Greg Timmons won the face off for 
the Tartans, and dished it off to freshman 
Chris Galvin. Galvin fumbled the puck, and 
that caused three Panthers to rush into the 
Tartan zone for a pass. But Pitt defensemen 
could not stop Galvin's pass to Brian 
Nogrady, who skated in unmolested and put 
a quick wrist shot past the defenseless Rohey 
for a goal. "Nogrady's goal just gave us the 
ultimate advantage," recalled Tartan tri­
captain Timmons. "With that goal we were 
within striking distance and we had [Pitt] on 
the run."
The frustration showed in the Panther 
players, and Pitt was called for a cross 
checking penalty at the 3:07 mark. With 
Carnegie Mellon up a man, they hawked 
inside the Pitt end, and got off a few good 
shots, only to be brushed off by Rohey's 
pads. As the »penalty expired, the Panthers 
got caught in a line change, which was all 
that Carnegie Mellon's Pat Merchak needed 
to score. Placing himself in front of the net, 
he took a
crossing pass from McGuire, Merchak dished 
off a backhanded wrist shot between the legs 
of Rohey for a 4-4 tie. For Merchak, it was 
his sixth goal in the last five games, and his 
ninth point over that stretch.
The uncertainty which plagued the Tartans 
in the second period was written all over the 
faces of the Pitt players in the third 
period.The quality of shots that Kerber faced 
in the third period was nowhere near the 
ferocity of the shots in the first two. 
Kerber, a freshman from Newington, 
Connecticut, stopped 30 of the 34 shots he 
faced on the day, and now has a stunning 2.7 
goals against average.Kerber has begun to 
understand the Tartan playing style much 
better, and now has come into his own 
minding the Carnegie Mellon net.
A little over ten minutes into the period, 
the Tartans took the lead for the first time, 
as Galvin, Timmons, and Larson hooked up 
for a goal. Larson bumped a Pitt player off 
the puck in the CM end, and Larson fed 
Timmons just across the red line. Timmons 
skated in past two defenders and fed Galvin, 
who flicked a quick wrist shot under the 
glove of Rohey.
With the Tartans up by a goal with five 
minutes left, the Panthers tried to play as 
rough as possible without getting caught. 
But the referees called Pitt for tripping at 
12:00, so the Tartans had a man advantage 
until there was one minute left in the game. 
Despite the Tartan advantage, they were

Scoring tough losses this week against 
PAC rival Bethany and Grove City College, 
the Women's Basketball Team is trying to 
get back into the win column. On the road, 
Bethany proved rude hosts last Tuesday, 
sending their visitors home with a 52-50 
loss, while the home court advantage didn't 
seem to help the squad's cause as they fell 77-
51 to Grove City.
The Bethany game proved a low-scoring 
game for both sides, with the Bisons just 
seeming to come alive in the second half, 
turning an eight point halftime deficit into a 
two point win. Scoring only 19 points in 
the first stanza, the Bisons outshot their 
guests by 10 tallies in the second period, 
netting 33 points.
Despite a 19-point effort by sophomore 
standout Lisa Lightner, the Tartans as whole 
just couldn't seem to connect. Aimee Reber 
was the only other Tartan to hit the double 
figures, scoring 10 points. Freshman Patti 
Chorgo was busy under the net, pulling 
down 10 rebounds in a defensive effort.
Saturday’s match-up with Grove City 
looked to" be an exciting contest, but 
unfortunately, the hoopsters were no 
competition for a hot Grove City squad.
Even after the first half, things looked pretty 
glum, as the Tartans were down by 18 
points. The game was relatively unexciting, 
as there were repeated lulls in the scoring. 
The first few minutes and Grove City’s quick 
domination set the tone of the contest.
Both the Tartans and Grove City were hot 
from the foul line, hitting 75% and 71% of 
their attempts, respectively. The real task 
was hitting from the floor. Several drives 
and lonely lay-ups by Roseanna Neupauer 
and Lightner added some spark to the 
competition, otherwise Grove City seemed 
to just score and score and score.
Lightner proved the only hoopster able to 
hit double digits, netting 15 points, while 
freshman Donna Spicuzza dropped in nine 
tallies. Chorgo was once again the leader 
defensivley, with 12 rebounds.
Grove City's Monica Yustak had a game 
high 20 points, while five of her teammates 
managed to score at least five baskets. 
Yustak was also the owner of the game-high 
14 rebounds.
The hoopsters will travel to Washington 
and Jefferson College this evening to meet * 
the Presidents for the first time this season 
while Saturday will see the squad at Hiram 
College.

Returning Bart Gives Tartans Needed MomentumCagers Dismantle Bethany, Grove City
By STEWART LEVINE
Tartan Staffwriter 
In the preseason, the Tartans were media's 
pick to win the PAC Championship. In the 
past few weeks, the Tartans had shown 
anything but championship play losing 
seven of eight. Last week, however, the 
championship team returned as the Tartans 
overwhelmed two PAC opponents. They 
traveled Wednesday to Bethany (7-9,3-2) and 
defeated the Bisons, who had won six of 
their last seven, 80-64 and crushed Grove 
City (5-9,2-3) at home on Saturday 82-61. 
The two victories raised the Tartans record to 
7-9, and brought them into a three way tie 
for second place with Bethany and the loser 
of Saturday's John Carroll-Thiel game.
The Tartans traveled to Bethany to take on 
the red-hot Bisons and last week's PAC 
Player of the Week Ron Bozick. In his three 
previous games, Bozick had scored 69 
points, hitting 16 of 27 three-point shots. 
To stop him, Head Coach Larry Anderson 
unveiled something new for the Tartans this 
season, man-to-man defense. Senior guard 
David Bart was given the task of guarding 
Bozick and shut him down. Bozick was 
only two of six from the floor and one of 
three from three-point range, scoring only 
five points. "One reason why we went to 
man-to-man is because David Bart can play 
and defend, Tom (Franklin) is a little 
smaller and it may be a little tougher for 
him to guard someone who is 6'2" or 6'3"."
With Bozick neutralized the PAC's number 
one defense held Bethany in check as 
Carnegie Mellon took an early 12-4 led by a 
hot Roger DeVries. The lead grew while the 
Bisons had trouble shooting (10 of 30 in the 
first half) and turning the ball over (12). 
With 6:57 left in the first half and a 23-16 
lead, the Tartans erupted to outscore Bethany 
18-5 and take a 41-21 halftime lead.
Things turned worse for Bethany in the 
second half, when twenty seconds in, Bozick 
committed his fourth foul forcing Bethany 
Head Coach Jim Zalacca to keep him out for 
most of the rest of the game. The Bisons 
were able to get within 13, when their high 
scorer Chris Pashke (12 points) converted a 
pair of free throws to make the score 47-34 
with thirteen minutes left. The Tartans then 
went back to work outscoring Bethany 13-1 
over the next four minutes to take a 
commanding 60-35 lead. From there, 
Carnegie Mellon coasted to the win.
The Tartans got solid performances from 
their cocaptains David Bart and Hart 
Coleman who each had 20 points. Coleman 
also had 14 rebounds and 6 blocked shots 
while senior forward Pete Cwalina added 14 
points and 9 rebounds and DeVries and 
freshman guard Harvey Beckham each had 9 
points.
Carnegie Mellon didn't have it quite as easy 
against the Grove City Wolverines who had 
spent Wednesday upsetting the PAC leader 
John Carroll 54-50. Both teams had trouble 
finding their touch early and after Grove 
City's Steve Carlson and DeVries traded 
three-point shots, the Tartans led 8-7 with 
five minutes gone. Carnegie Mellon then 
pushed ahead 22-15 when David Bart beat the 
Grove City press to find sophomore forward 
Darryl Long underneath the basket for the tip 
in. The Wolverines charged right back to 
take the lead 29-27 with 2:37 left. 
Sophomore forward Daren Moffatt iced the 
game ten seconds later and the Tartans never 
looked back.
One minute later, Grove City's Pat Drum 
fouled DeVries. As the first shot went in, 
Wolverine Chris Cekella fouled Pete 
Cwalina incensing Grove City Head Coach 
John Barr. Barr's temper gave him a

technical foul. DeVries proceeded to 
successfully complete his one and one,
Cwalina then converted his one and one, and 
one of the two foul shots for the technical.
Then, following a Grove City miss, Bart 
scored on a fast break to give the Tartans a 
36-29 half time lead and the momentum.
The second half started with the Tartans on 
fire, burying the Wolverines under a 64-39 
lead with 9:45 left in the game. Soon after, 
a twelve footer by Bart gave the Tartans a 27 
point lead, the largest of the season, 68-41.
From there, Grove City could pull no closer 
than seventeen points as the Tartans coasted 
to an 82-61 victory.
Four Tartans scored in double figures Bart 
had 18 followed by DeVries, Coleman, and 
Cwalina who had 16, 15, and 13 points 
respectively. Coleman and Cwalina also 
pulled down nine rebounds apiece while Bart 
and DeVries each had seven plus Coleman 
added six more blocks for a season total of 
52. Grove City was led by Deron Ryan who 
had 17 points while Steve Carlson and Joe 
Buckley added 13 and 10 for the Wolverines.
Coach Anderson attributed a large part of 
the change in play by the Tartans to Bart.
Commented Anderson, "I think the difference 
is that the first two or three games that we 
had David Bart didn't play, and the one when 
he came back we still weren't in sync. I 
think that it's been because of him that we're 
playing a lot better. Plus, I think it's 
getting down near the end of the year and the 
games mean a little more to the players. I 
think that they’re now ready to play, any 
time that you break that link in your chain, 
when you put it back, it's still a little rusty.
I think they're out there with a little more in 
confidence; they’re back in sync."
According to Bart, there's more to it than 
that. Said Bart, "I think when I came back, 
we were lacking in outside shooting, but 
with Roger starting and me playing it opens 
up something for everyone. There's also a 
lot of unselfishness and a lot of good 
passing is a major reason." However, Pete 
Cwalina agreed with his coach, "The 
difference is Dave Bart, plain and simple.
Dave Bart is the glue to the team, he's the 
most important cog in the machine." Hart 
Coleman also had his theories, according to 
Coleman, "It seems as though we're playing 
a little more as a team now and it seems that 
we've gone through a lot of problems so far 
and we're starting to get that we’ve gotten 
them. Dave Bart and Roger (DeVries) have 
been playing well and they've loosened up 
the zones we've been facing. Dave Bart

Remaining the only teams on campus to 
boast undefeated seasons, the Carnegie 
Mellon Men's and Women's Swim Teams 
crushed PAC rivals, the Bethany Bisons, last 
Tuesday 105-85 and 74-58, respectively.
The Men's squad came away with top 
honors in all but one event, leaving its hosts 
to pick up the pieces. The afternoon began 
with a win in the 200 yard Medley Relay as 
seniors Doug Biesecker and Rob "Bubba" 
Summers combined with sophomores Dave 
Chamberlin and Hal Levine to break the 
tape.
Senior captain Steve Francis left his mark 
on the Bisons as he came‘away with three 
first place finishes and a hand in securing a 
second place 400 freestyle race. Francis 
swept the 50, 100, and 500 yard freestyle 
races, while later combining with Pat 
Hensler, Biesecker, and Levine to earn a red 
ribbon in the relay.
As a whole, the squad was strong in the 
freestyle events, taking the top three honors 
in three races. Behind Francis in the' 100 
yard race were John Oslavsky and Levine, 
garnering the second and third place honors, 
respectively.
The 200 yard freestyle race saw junior 
Whitney Foster stopping the clock at 
1:56.66 with Summers and Biesecker
closing out the top three. Later on in the 
meet the 500 yard race found the Tartans in 
command with Francis, Hensler, and Foster 
finishing one, two, three.
Hensler and Summers each copped 
individual victories in the 100 yard freestyle 
and 100 yard back, respectively, while 
Chamberlin brought home a red ribbon for 
his efforts in the 200 yard Individual 
Medley.
In the final event of the day, the exhibition 
relay team comprised of Foster, Summer, 
Oslavsky, and Chamberlin swam to a 
3:30.36 finish to outdo the closest Bethany 
squad by some 20 seconds.
On the Women’s side, victories were just 
as numerous, with scoring spread well over 
the team. As with the Men, the Women's 
squad began the afternoon with an 
impressive relay win. Annakisa Eckbladh, 
Sara Wadia, Francesca Crannell, and Tiffany 
Pickering teammed up to score the first 
victory of the afternoon.
Sophomores Francesca Crannell and Suzie 
Kelley each scored double victories. 
Crannell earned blue ribbons in the 50 and 
100 free, while Kelley topped all 
competitors in both the 100 yard backstroke 
and 500 yard freestyle races.
Junior Amy Stemple and Pickering left

Wonderful images from Bella Lewitzky
By BRUCE KASREL
Tartan Entertainment Editor 
Ever since people began to question the 
strict regiment of traditional forms of dance, 
modem dance has tried to explore where 
ballet has not. Although this innovative art 
form has brought about a multitude o 
interesting and unusual ideas, a hadfulo 
artists are still trvigtiHHpplore where 
modem dance ^wiot. BeiS Lewitzky is 
such an artis^^^^^^ce Company’s per­
formance lap weekend gave Pittsjtoh it’s 
first taste oflPnat we may be &issini^
For over three decades aml^Sttiting, 
Lewitzky has been exploring new ifezons 
in the field of dance. Choosing to operate 
out of the west coast, she has distanced 
herself from the heavily competitive New 
York modem dance scene. Instead of churn­
ing out what we have come to know and 
expect from modem dance, Lewitzky puts 
forth ideas that other groups have yet to 
think of - much less perform. Her chor­
eography incorporates not only the dancers 
movements and their relationship to the 
other dancers, but also the dancers rela­
tionship with the space that surrounds them.
The first piece on the Saturday evening 
program was a relatively new work entitled 
Eight Dancers! Eight Lights and it 
demonstrated Lewitzky's fascination with 
high-technology. The “set” featured eight 
poles of neon lights that were dispersed 
across the stage. The dancers moved from 
one light, which would be extinguished up­
on exit, to another, which the dancers pre­
sence would breathe life into the lamp.
The lights were much more than 
decoration, they were used to create a sense 
of space. Much of the piece featured one 
many of the dancers moving around the 
tubes as if they were partners. The imagery 
was wonderfully poetic and striking.
The tempo of the piece shifted rapidly in 
accordance to the New Age-like score of 
Donald Knaack. One moment soft and 
subtle, the next energetic and humorous. 
Throughout the piece dancers approached the 
|tage and performed solos and 
jwcased their remarkable 
and flexibility, 
ly, however, that Lewitzky 
missed a perfect opportunity to expand the 
uons even further by allowing the raw 
>wer and effect of the illuminating power 
of the neon alone to surface. Although this 
may seem obvious, the obvious is not 
something one should expect from Lewitzky 
and quite probably the choice was deliberate. 
I After intermission, the pace of the 
performance changed drastically with Nos 
Duraturi. Choreographed to the Symphony 
of Psalms by Igor Stravinsky, the woric was 
a powerful Statement about man's struggle 
for survival. Though a poor recording, the 
combination effect of the music and dance 
was haunting.
Beginning 
dancers congrl 
and moved
prison-like costumes, the 
lied into angular formations 
in sinuous fashion. 
Weaving amongst one another, the dancers 
paired into ambisexual couples and locked 
together as if in chains. As the music reach­
ed its climatic chords of “Alleluias,” all 11 
dancers linked hands in preparation for the 
inevitable confrontation with what lies 
ahead. Even though the piece might not have 
been a real crowd pleaser, the emotional 
effect conveyed mostly by varried angles of 
the lighting and the dancers expressive 
was impressive, 
final work, Spaces Between, is perhaps 
occurrence where the surroundings 
the dancers. In it, the dance sports a 
15 foot long acrylic platform supported by 
hidden wires that rose above the stage. The
dancers slowly explored the new space 
created by the scaffold. Soon two dancers 
began to turn the platform into a giant 
swing. These on the ground began to dance 
around in pleasure. The lighting flickers, the 
electronic music starts pulsing and pound­
ing. As the piece closes lighting is once
again employed for a powerful effect as 
the dancers, dispersed all over the stage, 
blend together in a collage of silhouettes on 
the backdrop. The sensational images bursted 
with energy and feeling.
Thanks to Mrs. Lewitzky, modem dance is 
making tracks in the right direction.
The Affordable Floorsfinally hit the turntables
-
By DAN WEIR
Tartan Staffwriter 
In 1985, some gays from Pittsburgh made 
a cheap tape of an original song called 
Geneva. The next thing they knew, the song 
was riding high in Pitt's WPTS regular 
rotation. By early 1986, The Affordable 
Floors was a household name, as it were, 
with the college set throughout the city. 
Still early in 1986, The Floors won the Tri- 
State Rock Competition, and a spot on the 
compilation record Pittsburgh Sounds. The 
band continued playing local venues in and 
around Oakland for a period before Zapple 
Entertainment exec, John Antimary proposed 
his plans for The Floors to record an lp on 
his indie label, A.W.O.L. Records.
Now, finally, The Affordable Floors are 
on vinyl with The Sounding. The record is 
impressive from the structured songwriting 
down to the slick cover graphics. The 
singles are all here: Geneva, Walk Into the 
Night, The Sounding, Sirens, and The Long 
Winter ~ all guilty of the catchy vocal 
hooks and clever arrangements that typify 
this band's wistful pop sensibility.
Arguably, The Floors are a "synth" band, 
though I think that label inapropos as it 
implies a sort of mindless reliance on a 
sound rather than on a style. The twin 
synths of singer, Harvey Coblin and 
keyboardist, Kirk Botula work as a base for 
the cultured interplay of guitarist Stephen
heart as album versions of hits such as 
Geneva and Sirens have retained their semi­
gloss charm where overproduction may have 
reared its ugly head. And while there are a 
few new gratuities, those who have seen the 
band live will agree the concert sound has 
survived the mix. Those who consider 
themselves unitiated will undoubtedly say, 
"Oh, they do this song?" Keenly aware of 
the instrumental hook -- demonstrated best 
in the bass in Walk Into the Night and the 
synth in The Long Winter - The Sounding 
is stuffed with phrases that stick in your 
head for hours on end.
If I'm bound to find some fault with record 
it is the fluffy lyric to A Passion Not 
Known, a song based on the play Equus. I 
get the impression this song takes itself 
more seriously than it ought. Otherwise, 
The Sounding is a balanced trip, lyrically 
speaking. Especially evocative is the regret 
and longing described in Geneva .
In essence, I've a feeling The Sounding 
may be the start of something very big for 
The Affordable Floors .
You can see The Affordable Floors when 
they open for Britain's Human League at the 
Syria Mosque in Oakland, February 1st. 
Also, The Graffiti, in Oakland, will host an 
official release party for The Sounding, 
February 6th. For more information call The 
Graffiti box office at 682-4210.
After conquering the local scene, The Floors are going for national appeal
Morrison, bassist Eric Riebling and 
drummer Ken Zenkevich. The Rieb- 
ling/Zenkevich combination is perhaps the 
most offsetting element of the makeup. 
Both play with a precise flair that is the
combinative cornerstone to the band's 
danceable appeal. Morrison is in league with 
latter-day Paul Weller and INXS' Tim Farriss 
with his funky and tasteful guitar work.
Listeners familiar with the band will take

Contrasting styles at Forbes
"Contrasting" is a word that might well 
come up when discussing the new student art 
show at Forbes Gallery (Running from 
January 27 through February 1). Seniors 
Laura Wilson and Aaron Lahman will both 
display works with diverse styles.
Mr. Lahman's is showing several drawings 
and prints which he describes as "personal 
and introspective". Unlike Ms Wilson's 
Lahman's work is much more figurative and 
deals with expressive abstraction of the 
figure. His work tries to capture the soul of 
his subject. His colors are darker than those 
of his colleague, mostly black, white and 
rust. This stark look helps to bring out what 
the artist himself describes as a "duality of 
spirituality and earthiness."
Based on the talent of both artists and the 
diversity of their work, the new show at 
Forbes promises to be well worth the visit. 
The opening and reception is to be held on 
Tuesday, January 27 from 7 to 9 pm. The 
public is invited.
Ms Wilson's offerings consist primarily of 
paintings with some drawings. Her work is 
abstract yet most colorful. She deals with 
fitting both "general" and "personal" shapes 
and symbols together within the frame of 
one work. "I like to puzzle my paintings 
together and see how the pieces fit." The 
result is a wonderfully bright and abstract 
style that bears somewhat of a resemblance 
to that of Frank Stella.

Orchestra shines throughout Rachmaninov melodies
By SUZANNE SCHELKOPF 
Tartan Symphony Critic
yuoF weekend the Pittsburgh Symphony 
cd,EtoFdu presented its fifteenth concert in its 
Subscription Series. Returning to the pod­
rke from last week was Michael Tilson 
-EaeuoT who conducted the Sibelius Con­
,tdFa rS D Minor for Violin and Orchestra, 
c(ko 47, and the Symphony No. 2 in E 
hrSadT Opus 27, by Rachmaninov. The 
frasrS soloist was Cho-Liang Lin, whose 
(suLrSp astounded us all. The concert was 
7aFE enjoyable and reassuring.
Cho-Liang Lin began playing the violin at 
FEt upt of five and publicly performed at age 
otftS1 He later went to the Sydney Con- 
otdfuFadrke at twelve and at fifteen Fa the 
PkrssrudC School to study. Furthermore, it is 
GadFE noting that Michael Tilson Thomas 
uSC Cho-Liang Lin have worked together 
7tOadt1 Lin recorded the Mendelssohn Violin 
RaS,tdFa and Saint-Saens's Third Violin 
RaS,tdFa with the Philharmonic Orchestra 
kSCtd the direction of Thomas. It was named 
7toF recording of the year.
-Et opening Allegro moderato of the 
Ir7tsrkoT displayed Lin's wide dynamic range 
uSC obvious technical ability. His first solo 
rSFtdskCt was full of musicality and control. 
;ro fortissimo was not overbearing, but 
oGttF and smooth which flowed naturally 
into the character of the movement. 
Unfortunately in his second quasi cadenza, 
FEt intensely rude coughing of the audience 
7da2t the concentration and intensity which 
Guo otF up by the dynamic soloist earlier. 
yuFtdT this forced Thomas to turn to the 
ukCrtS,t in between movements to show his 
CropkoF1 However, the difficult entrances in 
FEt woodwinds and horns were nevertheless 
t't,kFtC with great precision. In the adagio
Cho-Liang Lin
di molto, Lin made the difficult solo lines 
appear effortless, and Thomas passed off a 
sudden meter change seamlessly.
The last movement, Allegro, ma non 
tanto, allowed us to view the extreme 
contrasts Lin was capable of. He alternated 
between pianissimo and triple forte with 
such defiance and control that one was 
immediately aware of his great abilities as an 
artist. Aside from a few tentative entrance 
cues by Thomas, the entire piece was 
amazing. Lin received three calls and many 
in the audience stood in recognition of such 
an accomplished performer. Lin's sincere 
smile assured us that he too was satisfied 
with the performance and appreciative of the 
response. Furthermore, one symphony play­
er stated, "You don't run across players like 
Lin very often", and after last weekend's 
performance, it is easy to see why!
The Rachmaninov reassured us of the
potential, which was demonstrated last week, 
of the Orchestra’s abilities. The first move­
ment proved to be a melodic unfolding of the 
thematic material which would appear 
throughout, and unify, the four movements. 
The melancholy mood swept between the 
basses and violins stretching the dynamic 
range to its limits. The english horn solo
“yrS euCt FEt CrOOr,ksF oasa 
srSto u((tud tOOadFstooT uSC 
-Eaeuo (uootC aOO u okCCtS 
etFtd ,EuSpt otuestoosL*
was delivered with much musicality and 
rhythmic precision. Rachmaninov builds to 
a triple forte, then deceivingly descends 
back down to pianissimo many times, 
working out the theme with great contrast 
and intensity. The clarinet solo and oboe trio 
were extremely good. The clarinet solo 
created a visual arc which was passed on to 
the violins and the english horn. The clarinet 
later returned and was calmed by the horn 
line. The hom anticedent and brass 
consequence were delivered very defiantly and 
with great confidence. Furthermore, the 
violins sounded as a band of flies which 
created much tension in the movement. 
Later, the intonation, changes and balance 
between the first violins and the english 
hom were unusually together.
Thomas also achieved many successful 
metric changes. At one point, the harmonies 
were so predictable and dynamics so full that 
the passage could have been extracted and 
used as background music to the happy 
ending of a movie. However, the movement 
had an unexpected ending.
The Adagio movement was recognizable to 
many of us due to an unfortunate theft by a
pop artist, who turned it into a tacky “love 
song” (Eric Harmon’s “All By Myself’). The 
themes introduced earlier in the first 
movement were and heard passed around the 
orchestra once again. The clarinet and 
english hom solos created the necessary 
character of the movement, which would 
later be interpreted by the Homs, Oboes and 
Strings. Thomas' sweeping motion conveyed 
the smoothness of the movement to the 
players. On the last fermata, Thomas milked 
it for all its worth and left the audience in 
dead silence. The last movement contained 
all of the themes presented previously and 
was delivered with great splendor. Overall, 
the Rachmaninov reassures us of the 
confidence we placed in the orchestra last 
week and will expect from now on.

By JOE BOB BRIGGS
Drive-In Movie Critic 
Everybody in Grapevine's been comin over 
Fa the trailer every night so we can steal the 
America's Cup race off satellite and watch a 
bunch of guys dressed up like they work at 
FEt insane asylum ride a little boat around 
FEt Indian Ocean at the speed of a 1963 
Volkswagen Beetle stuck in first gear. It's 
pdtuFT makes me feel patriotic. But in case 
FEtdt3o a bunch of you out there that don't

you forget where Australia is.
"Spinnaker": an infectious virus well-

("Hop into our pockets!").
"Tacking": the process of nailing dead 
aborigines to the hull of your opponent's 
boat, in order to bring bad luck.
"Gibbet": koala bear soaked in batter and

"Port": the opposite of the starboard side of 
FEt boat.
"Starboard": I forgot.
"Helmsman": guy who has 20 million 
bucks and nothin to do except play with his 
boat.
"Jerk": used interchangeably to mean either 
"the little squirt from New Zealand," "the 
one with the bad hair," or "Ted Turner."
"Sewer Man": guy forced to sit in the 
bottom of the boat cause he smells bad.
"Wing Leg": the reason the Sewter Man

Speaking of blowin a lot of money all over 
FEt screen, Rutger Hauer is exploding stuff 
again in this year's "Hitcher," which is called 
Wanted: Dead or Alive" and is based on the 
asC Steve McQueen series except instead of 
FEt Wild West it's in La-La Land. Rutger got 
hisself a leather jacket and a warehouse full 
aO semi-automatic shoulder cannons and his 
mission as a good bounty hunder is — find 
uSC kill the evil terrorist and lead singer of 
KISS, Gene Simmons. Gene is so mean that 
Et comes through LAX dressed like a rabbi 
uSC immediately starts carvin up panel-truck 
delivery guys and blowin up foreign- 
bullstuff movie theaters in Inglewood, and 
so the CIA wants Rutger Hauer to blow-dry 
Ero hair and go out and kill him. THe CIA's 
contact with Rutger will be Benson, whose 
series just got cancelled and so no one will 
suspect him of being employed again this 
soon.
First Rutger has to go spray a Vietnamese 
liquor store with grubby punk blood, then he 
has to go out to his boat in San Pedro and 
get a harmonica once owned by the late 
Steve McQueen from his girlfriend so he'll 
agree to make the sign of the twin-breasted 
screeching sea otter with her, and then after 
that he agrees to kill Gene Simmons for 
$250,000, plus a 50 thou bonus if he can
get Gene to put the white pancake makeup 
back on and go away. SO the rest of the 
movie Rutger drives all over El Lay stickin 
his knife in the gizzards of ragheads and 
sayin,"I want you contact. I wanna know 
WHO is responsible for the lyrics to "Beth."' 
And then Rutger wades around in the sewer 
and then his girlfriend and his best friend 
both get blown up and so we know what's 
comin next. Rutger the Barbarian, goin after 
Arnold's title!
We got 156 dead bodies, but only 18 on- 
camera. No breasts. Kneecap shooting. 
Character actor torture. Five exploding 
public places. Gratuitous fat-guy tattoo. 
Scuba Fu. Liquor store Fu. Hitcher "Oh, 
shucks, I forgot the Miranda warning" 
interrogation Fu. Drive-In Academy Award 
nominations for Robert Guillaume, as CIA 
Benson, for sayin, "We got a flashpoint 
situation here"; Gene Simmons, as Malak 
the terrorist, for sayin,"This will make 
Bhopal, India, look like a minor traffic 
accident"; Gary Sherman, the director, for 
makin his best flick since "Vice Squad" in 
82: Jerry Hardin, as the CIA director, for 
bein such a weenie; and Rutger, for playin 
really bad harmonica, and for sayin, "You're 
no SOLDIER. You're a fly on a pile of . . ." 
Four stars.
The week's drive-in video releases: "Young 
Warriors" (1983): Grimmest revenge flick 
ever made, with James Van Patten as the frat 
boy who makes cartoons by day and rides 
out at night to machine-gun armed robbers 
and avenge the murder of his little sister on 
the way home from the high school dance. 
Based on the idea that ail the graduates of 
Malibu High blew each other up one year, 
this "statement" flick by kid director
Lawrence D. Foldes was one of the most 
controversial of the year, and features Ernest 
Borgnine, Richard Roundtree and Lynda Day 
George as pieces of background furniture. No 
relief, no let-up. Heads roll. Four stars.
"The Wicked Lady" (1983): Faye Dunaway
runnin around England with a hat the size of 
Montana and a birth-control device, stealin 
and pointion her toenails at the ceiling. No 
real breast action, but one great scene where 
she grovels on the linoleum. Two and a half 
stars. Joe Bob says check em out.

We realize that one week isn't a lot of time 
to produce a masterpiece. We do feel that less 
time can force you to be more creative and act 
on instinct.
So write a story or poem and submit it to the 
Tartan/Dossier on a Macintosh disk by 
January 30th. And remember that Napoleon 
took over Europe in a week.
We're just asking for a story.
