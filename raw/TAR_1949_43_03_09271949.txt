Class of 1953 First To Use 
Revised Engineering Program
New Program Designed To Split Study Load
With Better Correlation Among Subjects
By Lloyd Dyer
Future slide rule artists -ef the Class of ’53 are the first to sched­
ule the newly revised freshmen engineering program. Prepared by 
a special committee headed by Dr. R. F. Mehl, head of the depart­
ment of metallurgical engineering, the altered curriculum is designed 
primarily to correlate more fully*--------------------------------------------------
the material covered in each sub­
ject and to distribute the study 
load more uniformly.
Results of last year’s freshman 
work survey formed the basis of 
the changes. It was found that 
while the catalogue listed 25 hours
Dr. R. F. Mehl
per week as the time which should 
be spent in outside preparation, 
the student actually spent an 
average of 27.5 hours and felt he 
would require an average of 34 
hours to completely cover his 
work.
Some Courses Difficult
Chemistry, physics, and engi­
neering drawing showed the 
greatest discrepancies between the 
‘nominal’ time and the time the 
student thought necessary for best 
results.
Since it was also felt by the 
committee that the entering stu­
dent lacked sufficient math to 
comprehend the physics course 
fully, this subject has been dis­
continued in the first semester. 
Units given for chemistry in the 
first semester have been increased 
from 9 to 11 over last year; math, 
11 to 12; social relations, 8 to 9; 
English, 8 to 9; engineering draw­
ing^ to 6.
Hygiene, a two unit course in 
the past, has been dropped from 
the curriculum entirely.
Twenty Hours Scheduled
This division gives the fresh­
men a total of 20 class hours and 
approximately 27 hours of outside 
preparation per week. These fig­
ures do not include units given 
for ROTC. and physical educa­
tion.
In the second semester the 
freshman will schedule a 9 unit 
physics course. Corresponding 
drops over the first semester in 
chemistry, engineering drawing, 
and mathematics of 1, 2, and 3 
units respectively will still give 
a work load of only 23% hours 
preparation.
Upperclass Changes
Changes in some of the upper- 
class programs are also being 
seriously contemplated. The new 
sophomore program will go into 
effect in September, 1950.
Others who assisted Dr. Mehl 
in the project were; Vice Presi­
dent Warner, Provost Smith, Pro­
fessors J. B. Rosenbach, D. W. 
VerPlanck, I. Esterman, and E. 
C. Creutz.
Whatfs Yours?
Your pet gripe about any 
campus matter has found an ear 
and a sympathetic shoulder. 
What’s more, there is a good 
chance your problem will be 
investigated and attacked.
The Undergraduate Advisory 
Committee, established by Dr. 
Doherty’s request last spring 
for the purpose of investigating 
and presenting solutions of 
campus problems to the admin­
istration, believes there are 
many problems that are never 
brought to their attention.
If you are aware of any 
problem in a letter to UAC, Box 
287, Interschool Mail. Identity 
of writer will be kept confiden­
tial.
Sororities Rush 
Eligible Girls
Pan-Hell Sets Limit 
On Membership Quota
Sorority rushing started last 
week at the PanHellenic recep­
tion at Carnegie Union. Rushees 
were entertained by the various 
sororities and given an opportu­
nity to meet their members.
PanHellenic Council established 
a membership quota of 45 for 
each sorority last spring. The un­
fortunate side of the situation 
arises from the fact that 133 
women in addition to many trans­
fer students are eligible for rush­
ing.
All sororities will entertain the 
rushees at teas and parties which 
are scheduled between October 1 
and October 15. The silent period, 
during which no sorority girls 
will contact rushees, will start on 
Monday, October 17, and will end 
at 5:00 p. fn. Tuesday, October 
18. Dean Campbell will be in 
charge of the preferential bid­
ding.
All rushees must pick up their 
bids by 1:00 on Tuesday, October 
18, and have their written replies 
in the Dean of Women’s office by 
5:00 that same day.
Earl Latter man * * *
IF Council 
Changes Name, 
Organization
Latterman To Head 
Council Of Presidents; 
Jack Collins Named VP
The Council of Fraternity Pres­
idents, formerly known as IF 
Council, has adopted several new 
rulings aimed, at increasing at­
tendance at meetings and gaining 
greater efficiency and prestige for 
the organization.
These rulings were adopted last 
June in their final meeting of the 
year together with the election of 
new officers who will assume office 
this term. The officers are Earl 
Latterman, Beta Sigma Rho, pres­
ident; Jack Collins, Phi Kappa, 
vice president; Richard Snedden, 
Alpha Tau Omego, Secretary; Bar­
ry Rowles, Delta Tau Delta, 
Treasurer.
Penalty Imposed
Under the new ruling, presidents 
of each fraternity and one junior 
member from each fraternity must 
attend each meeting under penalty 
of a $5.00 fine. This move was 
taken to insure that the same 
members would be present at the 
meetings and that these members 
would have the authority to make 
decisions for their respective fra­
ternities.
This year the group wrote the 
rushing rules which governed the 
recent rushing campaign and also 
published the rush booklet which 
was distributed to all freshmen.
Besides the usual business that 
comes before the Council each 
week, the fraternity presidents 
seek to write more satisfactory 
rules to govern the annual Greek 
Sing and Swing competition.
Scotch ’n Soda Announces 
Changes For Annual Show
Plans for a greatly changed Scotch and Soda show were an­
nounced last Friday by Dave Clark, chairman of the S’n S board.
This year’s presentation will be given during Spring Carnival 
week and will be a review-type show woven about collegiate life
with special emphasis on Carne-#----------------------------------------------------
gie Tech.
The review will be presented 
from the gymnasium stage with a 
minimum of expensive costumes 
and stage settings. It will consist 
of a number of short complete 
acts. Campus characters, institu­
tions, and humor will provide a 
collegiate atmosphere and com­
mon theme.
October 15 has been set as a 
deadline for skit ideas. By then 
they must have been presented to 
the executive board for consid­
eration. The playlets are to be at 
least in outline form.
Auditions To Be Held 
Shortly after the 15th auditions
will be held. At this time the 
skits must be presented with a 
complete script and lead sheets. 
The call for actors, dancers, and 
musicians will follow in several 
weeks.
Acts may be staged individual­
ly or by small groups. Music, 
dancing, straight comedies, or any 
combination of the three will be 
acceptable.
“Getting Too Large”
Clark, in clarifying the revi­
sions, said, “The thing has been 
getting too large to handle . . .

came more involved and expen-

Building Plans 
Made Known
Morewood Wing,
IA School Included
Carnegie Tech will begin work 
this year on a new dining-room 
wing for Morewood Gardens. 
President Doherty announced the 
improvement during his annual 
fall meeting with the Carnegie 
faculty.
He also disclosed that the site 
for the million-dollar building to 
house Carnegie’s newly opened 
graduate IA School will be across 
the street from the Tech gym­
nasium.
The Morewood Gardens dining 
wing to cost approximately $400,- 
000, was part of original rebuild­
ing plans when the apartments 
were acquired in 1947. High 
biulding costs kept the school 
from doing all it had planned by 
the time girls moved into the. 
building last year.
Building Costs Fall
“However,” Dr. Doherty said, 
“what appears to be a stabiliza­
tion of building costs has made it 
feasible to reopen our plans, and 
work will begin this year on the 
dining wing and on remodeling 
the first floor of the dromitory.”
He indicated that a recreation 
room, also part of the original 
scheme, may be included in the 
new wing.
In announcing the site for the 
new industrial administration 
building, Dr. Doherty told the 
faculty that it had been recom­
mended by the architects, Marlier 
and Johnstone, and had been ac­
cepted by the Board of Trustees 
and the new I.A. school’s donor,, 
the W. L. and May T. Mellon 
Foundation.
The Carnegie President said 
hopes were that work would be­
gin on the building this spring.

Editorials—
Solution Please
After fighting the battle of the bookstore for 
another year, we wonder if something could be 
done to alleviate the long lines, general confu­
sion, and shattered nerves which are a part of 
entering school each year.
Our own suggestion would be a set of num­
bered cards as those used in most butcher shops 
to designate the order of being served.
This would eliminate the necessity of lines 
and students could accomplish other tasks 
while waiting their turn.
A more extensive use of prepared kits such 
as were sold to freshmen this year w'ould also 
speed the process.
We are sure that these suggestions could 
easily be improved on by some IA student who 
is well versed in such problems. His rew'ard 
would be the indebtedness of thousands.
Too Far
We feel that Dorm Council leaders have bent 
over backwards trying to be democratic: bent so 
far. however, they have fallen flat on their backs.
An efficient plan of reorganization was ef­
fected last spring for the Council. When school 
started this fall, the leaders of Dorm Council 
felt that many of the dorm residents were not 
in accord with the plan and asked for a vote 
of confidence.
We praise this action for there have been too 
many ideas “railroaded” through organizations 
on campus. The result of the vote showed a three 
to one approval of the new plan. However, sixty 
per cent of the residents did not vote with the 
result that the plan was discarded, apparently 
with the assumption that the other sixty per cent 
of the voters were against the plan.
We hope that the Dorm Council leaders will 
reconsider their action. The plan for reorganiza­
tion is sound and deserves a try. The sixty per 
cent who did not vote evidently do not care 
how they are governed.

Glee Club 
Opens Season
Carnegie Tech Men’s Glee club 
will open its fall season this week 
with the first rehearsal scheduled 
for September 29.
All men who like to sing are 
invited to join the Glee club. 
Auditions for new members will 
be held today and Thursday, at 
4:30 p. m. in MMCC 103. Regu­
lar rehearsals are held twice 
weekly throughout the year.
Under the direction of Professor 
William A. Schaefer, the club is 
planning a well rounded musical 
repertoire and concert schedule. 
Included in the plans for this 
year are concerts for several civic 
and church groups, on-campus 
programs, radio programs, Christ­
inas caroling, and the annual 
Spring Concert at Carnegie Music 
hall.
In listing our objectives and justification for 
existence last week, we mentioned that the pub­
lication of a campus newspaper served as an 
outlet for student talent. We did not wish to 
imply, however, that this outlet was restricted 
to the staff.
One of the more widely read sections of any 
newspaper is the “Letters to the Editor” col­
umn. Any student who has an opinion, sug­
gestion, or just plain gripe that should be 
brought to the attention of the campus is w*el- 
come to air it in the Tartan at any time. It is 
the only way that many valuable opinions will 
ever come to light so that they can be acted 
upon if necessary.
We will welcome opinions that differ from our 
e itorial policy. If you feel that something is 
wrong with the coverage of an event or that our 
news stories are becoming slanted, this is your 
chance to tell us so.
All letters must be signed, but names of 
authors will be withheld if requested. The Tar­
tan retains the right to edit a letter for make-up 
purposes.

Poor Dr. Mehl, he’s trying to squash an ugly 
rumor that has followed him back from his re­
cent trip to Brazil. Its text . . . Dr. Mehl gave 
a talk in Portuguese for wThich four Brazilian 
friends said they would keep separate lists of 
all the words he mispronounced. All the boys 
agreed, for they turned in four lists of only ten 
words each . . . but all the words were dif­
ferent.
Mrs. Hagins, the Carnegie Union’s cheerful 
hostess is having quite a struggle convincing 
people as to the correct interpretation of several 
signs newly planted along the drive . . . they

Editor, the TARTAN:
Atomic age-poof! 1000 mile per hour air- 
craft-poof! Right on the Carnegie Tech campus 
is the greatest achievement—greatest time saving 
achievement in history. We have unsynchronized 
clocks!
Take a normal day. I get up, leisurely pre­
pare my toilet, select my tie for the day from
the rack of three, collect my books, and amble
over the autumn campus on my way to class.
I look at my watch. It says half past. But do I 
hurry? Do I fear that moment of breathless ar­
rival at class when I open the door and find the 
students busy with notebook and pen, all heads 
lined in orderly rows listening to the lecture 
already underway? Naturally I do not.
I merely follow a carefully planned route. 
At one clock I pick up a minute, turn back the 
hand on my wrist watch. At the next I pick up 
three more, at the next two, the next five. By 
the time I reach the classroom, I have gathered 
anywhere from 10 to 15 minutes, and I walk into 
the class beaming my confidence. ,
No instructor dares to question MY timepiece! 
I'm not on radio time. I’m on Tech time—better 
than anything daylight saving ever dreamed of 
turning out.

Editor, the TARTAN:
According to Newsweek, Carnegie Tech has 
an excellent engineering school. It seems to me 
that a technical school with Tech’s standards 
should have little trouble setting up a system 
whereby all the clocks on the campus could be 
synchronized. They evidently have had trouble 
setting up such a system. Of the six clocks that 
I checked there was a discrepancy Of one to ten 
minutes from Naval Observatory time. In addi­
tion to this, none of the clocks agreed with the 
bells. The students at Tech are bewildered 
enough as it is. Let’s set the clocks right and 
keep them right.

Student Council Loan
Five Hundred Dollar Advancement 
Needed For Publicity. Organization
Campus Chest, organized last year to combine campus fund

Organizationsl
In accordance with the new 
by-laws of Student Council, all 
campus organizations intending 
to hold or to sponsor any social 
events during the school ear 
should appoint one person (pre­
ferably the social chairman) as 
official representative to the so- * 
cial chairman of Student Coun­
cil.
This official representative 
shall arrange for the particular 
organization’s part in the all 
school social calendar. The rep­
resentative’s name will also be 
registered in the Office of the 
Dean of Women, and, to elemi- 
nate some of the past confusion, 
only the official representative 
shall be permitted to schedule 
any social events.
In the event of a change of 
personnel, the new representa­
tive should present a letter to 
that effect, signed by the or­
ganization’s president.
As prescribed by the new 
by-laws, the social chairman of 
Student Council is an ex-officio 
member of any committee spon­
soring any all school social 
events.

Plans Revealed 
For Assemblies
Carnegie Theatre Sets 
Unique Chapel Services
Tuesday will be a big day for 
the Carnegie Theatre this year. 
For on Tuesdays at 11:30, Carne­
gie will hold Chapel services fea­
turing prominent national and re­
ligious speakers.
Mr. Rollin Davis, chairman of 
the Chapel committee states, “The 
program for this year features 
quite a bit of the music and beau­
ty of religion and should appeal 
to the students.”
Ford To Speak
“Why I Have Faith in the Fu­
ture,” a talk on the subject of 
present international attitudes to­
ward the future, will initiate 
Chapel service at Carnegie. This 
program, scheduled for October
4, will feature Rev. Howard J. 
Ford, chaplain of catholic stu­
dents at Pitt and Carnegie, Rabbi 
Goodman Rose, and Rev. Hugh 
Clark of the Church of the Re­
deemer.
On October 18 a song service 
will be the highlight of the Chapel 
program.
Hobart Mitchell will present ; 
another of his “Sermons In Song” 
to a Carnegie audience on No­
vember 1. Mr. Mitchell, upon re­
quest of the students, has re­
turned to CIT for a repeat per­
formance of his baritone arrange­
ment of religious meditation ren­
dered at Carnegie last year.
Pictures Scheduled
Another outstanding program 
will include a series of pictures 
titled the “Melody of Nature,” 
consisting of Kodachrome slides 
with synchronized music and nar­
rative. Rev. Lester Chase, the 
narrator, has declared that this 
series is “a popular religious 
mediation.”
Wandering Greeks

Budget, publications, and class 
reorganization reports were heard 
by the 26 members present. Pres­
ident Sinclair made regular com­
mittee chairmanship appointments 
as well as several special com­
mittee appointments.
Football Situation
Carrying out his election plat­
form, Frederick Lunt asked for 
an appointment to check into the 
football situation. He said that 
the circumstances surrounding the 
situation had led him to believe 
that everything that could be done 
had not been done.
The Class Reorganization com­
mittee announced a freshmen pep 
rally to be held in the Men’s Gym 
Friday. (A discussion of the rally 
appears elsewhere in this issue.— 
Ed.)
Again Investigated
A committee, composed of Ted 
Goodson', Robert Carpenter, Carl 
Rickard, and Alfred Wells, to in­
vestigate the reestablishing of a 
variety publication on the campus 
this year was suggested by Jim 
Reynolds, chairman of the publi­
cations committee. The investi­
gation was conducted last year, 
but due to the new publication 
set-up it is necessary again.
Ella Baum, Dorothy Gillan, 
Robert McKelvey, and Charles 
Koester were appointed to the Ex­
ecutive Publishing board of the 
Technical. Assigned to the Tar­
tan board were Richard Holl, 
Frank Witt, Albert Kimmel, and 
Herbert Stone.
Committee Of One
Councilman Witt was appointed 
a committee of one to make sure 
all campus organizations have a

Reversion
An apparent indifference on the 
| part of dorm students to their 
j methods of self government, has 
forced Men’s Dorm Council ofli- 
| cers to revert to the council's for­
mer organization.
A new plan of organization pro- 
j viding for a Board of directors 
J for each dorm and wing was es- j 
tablished last spring. The officers/
! however, were not sure that full 
I support was behind them and 
asked for a vote of confidence 
j when school reconvened.
Results of the voting showed 
1 that 30 per cent were in favor of 
I the change, 10 per cent were 
! against, and 60 per cent were in- 
] different.
The old organization called for 
one board with representatives
I from all dorms. The body was 
! believed to be too large for effi­

' was planned.

Victory PredictedSportscope For Phi,I CrW*r8
In Opening Game
Football is at last here, and it's easy to see that despite 
some of the pessimistic predictions regarding the Plaid’s cur­
rent entry, the Carnegie fans are still awaiting the opener 
villi visions of victory in their minds.
The Tartan has been about as consistent in its attitude 
toward the local team's future as the Pittsburgh weather­
man. It is, however, next to impossible to tell a football 
team, especially one like Carnegie’s, what they are going to 
do before the season opens.
And now what looked like a relapse into the form dis­
played by the C’lT squads of the Donolioe era, begins to take 
’he proportions of just a bad day which sooner or later 
conies to the best of them. This Tartan team is far from great, 
but it will be better than any that the post war students here 
have ever seen.
I p front they’re strong. Gerry Meyers and Norm Keats 
are like blocks of granite in a line which seems to have no 
weak spots. Floyd Wiseman, Larry Stovicek. and Jim Traut­
man comprise a middle which is unbeatable.
.Most pleasing aspect of the line, however, is the ends. 
The entire crew of terminals, and Lou Fougere in particular, 
have "¡veil evidence that the almost traditional defensive weak­
ness at those spots has come to an abrupt end.
The hackfield is good. It’s exceptionally strong in points 
but is wanting at others. Defensively they may have troubles 
with passes.
Nick Simcic and Johnny Luehok are the big guns which 
Dr. Baker will fire at the opposition. Both have speed to burn 
and with Luchok’s ever-increasing improvement over his past 
performances they promise to give the Plaid a double-barreled 
running attack.
Tom Haney has been doing a nice job at the fullback 
slot. His lack of weight has been his biggest drawback to 
date. Jack Magnifico, always a strong defensive back, has been 
hampered by minor injuries, while Wes Kenney just hasn’t 
measured up as a runner. Bobby Sommer could help out 
here, but that would leave the quarterback position without »• 
a capable first line candidate.
Behind these men there isn’t too much. The second eleven 
js too spotty to be counted on for much support. Consequent­
ly, it wouldn’t be too surprising to see more than a few sixty-1 
minute players. , j
One thing which is certain about this Carnegie team 
should make every game worthwhile and certainly interest­
ing to watch. The 1949 Tartans are an explosive team. The 
game will never be over until the final whistle has blown.
You can look for the unexpected with a strong possibility 
that you’ll get it.
With Luehok and Simcic carrying the ball every play is 
a potential touchdown from anywhere on the field. They are \ 
both dangerous men in the open and once shaken loose will i 
be tough to stop.
Sommer, who won’t get his name in the scoring column 
too frequently, is perhaps the key to the whole offensive 
situation. His passing can make or break the attack at cer­
tain crucial points. When he's on, there isn’t a finer passer 
in the district. A lot will depend on the Mt. Lebanon senior’s 
right arm.
Pep Rallies
"Beat Bethany” cries will rise 
from the cut Friday night as 
the first pre-game pep rally of 
the season takes form. A parade 
starting from the gymnasium 
will lead to the cut and get 
the ceremonies underway.
Cheerleaders, the Kiltie band, 
and a huge bonfire will mark 
the occasion.
Plans are being* formulated 
now for a victory rally tenta­
tively scheduled for Saturday 
evening. Final arrangements 
will be made public at the Fri­
day night affair.
Intramural 
Teams Set
For Openers
Carnegie Tech’s football squad will travel to Wellsburg, W. Va. 
this Saturday to meet Bethany’s gridders in the opening Tartan 
game of the season. If Bethany’s 31-6 upset over DaXas Elkins Col­
lege last Saturday is indicative of the Bisons’ power, the CIT team
* should have its hands full in the 
coming meet.
Two of the Bisons’ touchdowns 
were scored by Eric Antilla of 
Wheeling, a promising triple threat 
addition to Bethany’s secondary. 
The Bison lineup boasts thirty- 
fijfe experienced men, including 
twenty-one returning lettermen.
Saturday’s game will renew a 
football rivalry which has been 
dormant since 1929. Of the seven 
meetings of the two teams be­
tween 1912 and 1929 Carnegie 
Tech won six. Last year Bethany 
eked out a 7-6 win over Salem 
for its only victory of the year. 
Duke Frosh Lose 
The Kiltie Band, making its 
first public appearance of the year, 
will accompany the team to Beth­
any and will entertain the specta­
tors between halves. Wellsburg’s 
Kiwanis Club and the Bethany 
College Club of the Ohio Valley 
are jointly sponsoring the contest 
as a benefit performance..
The Tartan grid team finally 
showed some promise as they 
swept to a 19-7 victory over the 
Duquesne reserves last Friday af­
ternoon. The Dukes tallied their 
only score in the first half as they 
held the Plaid scoreless. The 
Techites came to life in the second 
half as Sirncic scored on an off 
tackle play.
Sommers passed to Fougere on 
the five yard line and the Tartan

In preparation for the ap­
proaching intramural football sea­
son, organizations planning to en­
ter teams in competition have 
been practicing daily on the “cut.” 
Both Emanon and TNT, independ­
ent powers on the intramural 
scene, have come up with strong 
teams. Phi Kappa and PiKA ap­
pear to be the fraternity leaders 
in the gridiron sport.
Opening games are scheduled 
for Monday, October 3, with en­
tries due in the intramural office 
by 4:30 on September 27.
Mr. David See, intramural su­
pervisor, has requested that all 
teams observe existing safety reg­
ulations. He has emphasized 
proper conditioning of all play­
ers, adherence to rules both in 
games and during practice ses­
sions, and the wearing of required 
equipment as the best preventa- 
tives of injuries.
All intramural football players 
will be required to undergo phy­
sical examinations this week. Ex­
amination schedules will be posted 
on the gymnasium bulletin board.

CIT’s varsity basketball squdd 
is already going through pre­
liminary workouts in anticipation 
of a successful season. Coach 
Cratsley has good reason to be 
optimistic about his prospective 
team for he will be working with 
nine returning lettermen.
In addition 4o these veterans 
the squad will be further assisted 
through the efforts of Tasso Kat- 
selas, Leonard Brandhi, and Dave 
Ellies. The only doubtful player 
on the team is captain-elect Mike 
Theodore. Mike is still bothered 
considerably by a shoulder and 
back injury sustained last year, 
but it is expected that he will be 
able to practice regularly by the 
middle of October.
The varsity will play 22 games 
this year.
Carnegie Tech’s football op­
ponents faired quite well this past 
weekend. Of the six who saw ac­

IBM’s--Mechanical Marvels
Administration 
Adds IBM Marvels
By AI Bader
Would you like the names of 
any students from your home­
town? Or would you like to meet 
only those of the opposite sex? 
The newest mechanical marvels 
brought to Carnegie Tech’s cam­
pus, the IBM, International Busi­
ness Machines, will answer your 
questions.
But the real purpose of the ma­
chines is to turn out grade reports 
speedily and to facilitate the post­
ing of a student’s records. Grades 
•will be mailed within 3 or 4 days 
after having been turned in by the 
profs instead of the 3 or 4 weeks 
required in past years.
Any Question Answered 
Any question can be answered 
by the machines, or at least by 
the sorting machine. Provided it 
has the information, it will run 
through all student punch cards, 
where information is punched in 
code, and pick out only the cor­
rect cards.
Perhaps you are the Dean of 
Men and would like the names of 
all students who came to Carnegie 
with advanced standing. The 
sorting machine wall give you 
those names, and answer any 
other conditions set.
IBM knows more about you 
than you think. It even knows 
when you are at a certain class 
and where that class is, and in 
years to come it will even be able 
to tell you whether you passed or 
not and with what grade.
Long: Process Necessary 
Of course, IBM does not only 
represent an answer box, or 
smooth machinery for turning out 
grade reports. It is true that the 
address on the grade report 
slipped into a little window envel­
ope is also printed by an IBM. 
But this is only the end product 
of much work and apparent con­
fusion.
Freshman Records Only 
The IBM system of posting 
permanent records is not yet in 
full effect. Only the records of 
the new freshmen will be kept on
D"NTl"pNO tDie UpJpepgii x ’Ie .’JJ t’LN hl"e
punch cards; those of the upper­
classmen will still be kept in the 
old written form.
For those persons interested in 
howr the whole operation goes, 
here is a brief resume. First, a 
student data sheet is prepared by 
hand. From this a master statis­
tical card is prepared for each 
student on a machine which 
punches holes in a coded sequence 
as the information is typewritten. 
From this master statistical card 
student information cards are 
prepared on a duplicating ma­
chine.
Grades Recorded
These last cards give the stu- 
| dent the necessary information, 
j such as his student number, for j 
| filling out his class admittance | 
! cards. One set of cards is used ' 
! for admittance to classes and an- i 
other, after all adjustments have : 
| been made, is sent to instructors 
; for mid-semester grades.
Instructors return the brown- 
| striped cards, the grades are i

There’s no finer cigarette in the world today than Lucky 
Strike! To bring you this finer cigarette, the makers of 
Lucky Strike go after fine, light, naturally mild tobacco 
—and pay millions of dollars more than official 
parity prices to get it! So buy a carton of Luckies 
today. See for yourself how much finer and smoother 
Luckies really are—how much more real deep-down 
smoking enjoyment they give you. Yes, smoke a Lucky! 
It s a finer, milder, more enjoyable cigarette!
DAN CURRIN, independent warehouse opera­
tor of Oxford, N. C., has smoked Luckies for 
20 years. He says: “Tome, Luckies taste better.
I've seen the makers of Luckies buy fine, 
prime tobacco, you know!” Here's more
